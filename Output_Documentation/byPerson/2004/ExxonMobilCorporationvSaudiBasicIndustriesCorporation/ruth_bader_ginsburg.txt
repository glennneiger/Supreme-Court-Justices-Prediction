justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
you
have
a
continuing
case
or
controversy?
that
was...
that...
that's
a
bedrock
article
iii
requirement,
and
if
you've
got
all
the
relief
that
you
were
seeking...
let's
put
it
this
way.
suppose
your
opponent
sabic
says,
here's
the
check
for
the
$417
million
and
we
undertake
that
we're
not
going
to
pursue
any
further
relief.
would
you
have
a
case
or
controversy
left?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you've
got
all
the
relief
to
which
you
are
entitled,
that
does
make
a
case
moot.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
would
be
stuck
anyway
because
you
made
a
counterclaim
and...
and
it
would
be...
on
which
you
prevailed.
and
in
that
counterclaim
you
would
be
precluded
if
you
didn't
ask
for
everything
that
you
could
get.
but...
but
at
this
stage
at
least,
the...
the
door...
there...
there
is
still
conceivably
an
avenue
of
further
litigation
because,
sabic
hasn't
yet
said
that
it's
not
going
to
do
anything
more,
that
it
isn't
going
to
petition
for
cert,
for
example.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
has--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
coleman,
would
you
clarify,
i
think,
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
inquiry?
rooker-feldman
both
involved
state
court
litigation
that
was
over
and
done
with.
then
you
come
to
the
federal
court.
you
have
two
parallel
cases
would
be...
brought
within
a
month
of
each
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
isn't
the
standard
defense
of
the
person
who
has
started
the
other
suit
first,
well,
your
honor,
prior
action
pending,
please
hold
the
case
that
started
second
in
abeyance
till
we
get
done?
and
if
we
win
in
the
first
case,
then
it
will
be
precluded.
then
the
second
case...
the
parallel
case
will
be
precluded.
that's
not
rooker-feldman
territory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
rooker-feldman,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
is
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
bar.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
to...
so
if
the
two
lawsuits,
the
state
court
suit
and
the
federal
suit...
they're
proceeding
concurrently
or
one
is
held
in
abeyance
waiting
the
other,
there
is
certainly
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
of
the
federal
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
apply
rooker-feldman
in
that
context
would
say
you
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
at
the
outset,
but
then
you
lost
it
somewhere
down
the
line.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
were
only
the
two
cases,
rooker
and
feldman,
that
established
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
this
court
ever
said
anything
to
suggest
that
rooker-feldman,
as
apart
from
preclusion
doctrine,
applies
to
parallel
litigation
instead
of
you
go
into
federal
court
after
the
state
court
is
over
and
you're
trying
to
undo
what
the
state
court
did?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
no
preclusion
unless
they're
also
decided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
castanias,
was
there
a
proper
case
in
the
district
court
when
the
complaint
was
initially
filed
there
some
2
months
after
you
filed
in
delaware?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
so
you
can
bring
two
cases,
identical
cases,
in
two
different
courts,
and
that's
an
everyday
thing,
and
the
defense
is
prior
action
pending.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
you
are
urging
that
rooker-feldman
which
this
court
never
applied
when
you
had
parallel
litigation
be
extended
into
a
domain
which
is
ordinarily
taken
care
of
by
preclusion
doctrine.
why
would
you
want
to
mix
those
two
things
up
that
now
seem
to
me
rather
clear,
that
if
you
have
rooker-feldman,
when
you
rush
into
a
federal
court
and
say,
federal
court,
undo
that
state
court
judgment,
i
don't
like
it?
rooker
was
just
a
paradigm
case
of
that.
why
would
you
want
to
spread
that
doctrine?
what
is...
what
is
there
that
preclusion
doctrine
doesn't
accomplish?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
anything
fancy
like
colorado
river.
prior
action
pending
is
a
familiar
defense.
you've
got
two
actions.
they
could
even
be
in
different
districts
of
the
same
state
and
one
says,
your
honor,
this
case
started
second,
the
other
one
is
going
forward,
hold
it
in
abeyance
because
there's
a
prior
action
pending.
that's
not
colorado
river
abstention
or
anything
like
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
sometimes
district
judges
rule
incorrectly,
but...
but
what
happened
here
is
the
district
court
case
did
not
go
on
because
the
two
of
you,
both
sides,
said,
okay,
the
district
court...
they're
all
bollixed
up
with
this
foreign
sovereign
immunity
act,
so
we're
going
to
agree.
you
agreed
that
the
case
would
go
forward
in
delaware,
the
trial
in
delaware.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
when
you
say
they
pushed
in
delaware,
you
brought
them
into
delaware
and
a...
in
a
reverse
suit.
you
wanted
a
declaration
of
nonliability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
brought
their
case
for
liability
in
the
federal
forum.
they
were
forced
by
you
into
the
delaware
forum,
and
now
you're
saying
you
were
pushed,
that
exxon
pushed.
you
brought
the
case
in
delaware.
they
didn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
your
preferred
forum,
not
theirs.
when
they
filed
their
complaint,
they
filed
it
in
new
jersey
where
they
had
a
related
case
pending.
so
you
chose
the
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
perhaps
the
court,
if
it
had
been
more
cautious,
would
have
spoken
not
in
terms
of
rooker-feldman
or
review,
but
in
terms
of
this
matter
has
been
decided.
it
is
claim
precluded.
that's
what
preclusion
doctrine
is
supposed
to
do.
so
in
that
context,
maybe
this
court
used
the
wrong
word.
maybe
it
should
have
said,
you
litigated
it,
it's
over
and
done
with,
now
it's
precluded.
why
do
you
need
to
interject
the
word
review?
isn't
that...
unless
you're
going
to
say
every
time
court
a
decides
a
case
and
then
you're
in
court
b
and
someone
is
raising
the
same
claim,
that
is
a
review
of
court
number
one
rather
than
you're
precluded
in
court
two
because
of
what
is...
has
been
litigated
and
decided
in
court
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
sometimes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
why
one
has
preclusion
because
you
are
giving
respect,
full
faith
and
credit,
to
a
decision
elsewhere.
that's
what
preclusion
doctrine
is
all
about.
we
respect
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
rendered
it.
we,
therefore,
give
it
full
faith
and
credit.
that's
what
preclusion
doctrine
is
about,
is
about
respect
and
credit.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
you're
asking
us
to
extend
rooker-feldman
beyond
where
this
court
has
taken
it,
and
if
i
recall
correctly,
you
really
didn't
ask
for
this.
the
third
circuit
injected
rooker-feldman
into
the
case.
is
that
not
true?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
no,
because
it's
where
you
walk
in
the
door.
and
you
started
out
by
saying
this
case,
i
think
as
you
must,
was
a
proper
federal
case.
it
was
properly
filed
in...
and
it
was
properly
filed
in
delaware.
so
you
can't
talk
about
a
case
that
says,
if
you've
got
this
kind
of
case,
you
go
in
this
door.
if
that
kind
of
case,
you
go
in
that
door.
you
have
a
case
here
that
could
go
in
either
door,
the
federal,
the
state.
the
usual
rule
is,
is
it
not,
that
if
federal
jurisdiction
attaches,
it
doesn't
get
lost
because
of
subsequent
events.
for
example,
if
a
defendant
moves
into
the
plaintiff's
state
and
the
only
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
is
diversity,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
isn't
lost,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe.
it's
not...
it's
not
maybe--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
case
can
become
moot,
but
we've
already
expressed
considerable
doubt
whether
that
is
the
fate
of
this
case.
the
notion...
you
used
it
derisively...
the
insurance
policy.
lawyers
bring
protective
actions
all
the
time,
don't
they?
there's
nothing
wrong
with
doing
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
what
is
come
to
be
known
as
the
rooker-feldman
doctrine
applied
by
this
court
only
twice
in
1923
in
rooker
v.
fidelity
trust
company
then
60
years
later
in
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
v.
feldman.
in
rooker,
the
plaintiffs
who
had
suffered
an
adverse
judgment
in
state
court
thereafter
filed
suit
in
federal
district
court
alleging
that
the
state
court
judgment
was
unconstitutional.
plaintiffs
asked
the
federal
court
to
declare
the
state
judgment
null
and
void.
in
feldman,
two
plaintiffs
brought
federal
court
actions
after
the
district
of
columbia’s
highest
court
denied
their
petitions
to
waive
a
court
rule
requiring
d.c.
bar
applicants
who
have
graduated
from
an
accredited
law
school.
in
both
rooker
and
feldman,
this
court
emphasize
that
appellate
jurisdiction
to
reverse
or
modify
a
state
court
judgment
is
lodged
exclusively
in
this
court.
the
plaintiffs
in
rooker
and
feldman
had
litigated
and
lost
in
state
court;
their
subsequent
federal
complains
invited
federal
district
courts
to
declare
the
adverse
state
court
judgments
invalid.
we
held
such
federal
suits
impermissible.
the
question
we
confront,
does
rooker-feldman
cover
the
case
at
hand.
the
parties
exxon
mobil
and
saudi
basic
industries
became
involved
in
the
dispute
about
royalty
charges
for
licensing
certain
manufacturing
technology.
saudi
basic
preemptively
filed
a
lawsuit
in
delaware
state
court
seeking
a
declaration
that
the
royalties
were
proper.
two
weeks
later,
exxon
mobil
countersuit
in
federal
district
court
in
new
jersey
seeking
to
hold
saudi
basic
liable
for
royalty
overcharges.
the
state
court
case
proceeded
to
jury
trial
resulting
in
a
verdict
of
over
$400
million
for
exxon
mobil.
before
trial
took
place
in
the
state
court,
the
federal
district
court
had
denied
saudi
basic's
motion
to
dismiss
the
parallel
federal
suit.
after
the
delaware
jury
verdict,
saudi
basic
pursued
the
interlocutory
appeal
from
the
federal
district
court’s
refusal
to
dismiss
the
federal
action.
responding
to
that
appeal,
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
on
its
own
motion
invokes
the
rooker-feldman
doctrine.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
question
the
district
court's
possession
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
at
the
outside
of
the
suit
but
held
its
federal
jurisdiction
terminated
when
the
delaware
court
ended
judgment
on
the
jury
verdict.
we
granted
certiorari
in
view
of
the
contingent
in
lower
courts
regarding
the
proper
application
of
rooker-feldman.
the
rooker-feldman
doctrine,
we
hold
today,
is
confined
to
cases
of
the
kind
from
which
the
doctrine
acquired
its
name.
cases
brought
by
state
court
losers
complaining
of
injuries
caused
by
state
court
judgments
rendered
before
the
district
court
proceedings,
commenced
and
inviting
the
district
court
to
reject
those
state
court
judgments.
rooker-feldman
does
not
otherwise
override
or
supplant
preclusion
doctrine
or
augments
this
circumscribed
doctrines
that
allow
federal
courts
to
stay
or
dismiss
proceedings
in
deference
to
state
court
actions.
when
there
is
parallel
state
and
federal
litigation,
as
there
is
here,
the
entry
of
judgment
in
state
court
while
the
federal
suit
is
underway
does
not
trigger
the
rooker-feldman
doctrine.
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
act,
once
the
state
court
adjudication
is
complete,
disposition
of
the
federal
action
would
be
governed
by
state
preclusion
law
committee
or
abstention
doctrines
may
sometime
require
or
permit
a
federal
court
to
stay
or
dismiss
a
federal
action
in
favor
of
state
court
litigation
but
rooker-feldman
does
not
come
into
play
to
halt
federal
proceedings
simply
because
a
state
court
reaches
the
finishing
line
first.
exxon
mobil
plainly
has
not
repaired
to
federal
court
to
undo
the
substantial
delaware
judgment
in
its
favor.
rather,
it
appears
exxon
mobil
filed
its
federal
suit
to
protect
itself
in
the
event
it
lost
in
delaware
on
grounds
such
as
the
state
statute
of
limitations
that
might
not
preclude
relief
in
the
federal
venue.
a
protected
action
of
that
order
is
entirely
proper.
the
rooker-feldman
doctrine
did
not
deprive
the
federal
court
or
jurisdiction
at
the
outset
of
exxon
mobil’s
action
and
the
doctrine
did
not
emerge
later
to
vanquish
federal
jurisdiction
after
exxon
mobil
prevails
in
delaware.
because
the
third
circuit
misperceived
the
narrow
ground
occupied
by
rooker-feldman,
we
reverse
that
court’s
judgment.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
