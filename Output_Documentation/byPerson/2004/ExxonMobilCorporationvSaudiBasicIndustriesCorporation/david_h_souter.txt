justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
for?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
win
on
the
preclusion--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
do
you
get
then
in
substance?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
do
you
intend
to
do?
if
you
win
on
preclusion,
what
do
you
do
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
argument...
it
seems
to
me
the
argument
is
that
in
a
de
facto
sense,
when
you
try
to
litigate
the
federal
case,
after
losing
the
state
case,
you
in
effect
are
asking
the
federal
court
in
some
sense
to
review
what
happened
in
the
state
court.
justice
ginsburg's
answer
to
that
is
preclusion
is
the
answer.
is
that
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
if
that...
if
that
is...
if
we
accept
that
as
the
answer,
then
there's
no
argument
for
saying
you
should
expand
rooker-feldman
to
include
the
de
facto
review
as
opposed
to
the...
the
very
strict
sense
of
review
that
you're
talking
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
take
it
that's
because
you
don't
have
the
cert
period
expired
yet
in
the
first
action
and
you
don't
have
the
check.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
it's...
if
the
3
months
is
expired
and
the
check
is
in
your
hand
and
it's
certified,
what's
left?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
asking
about
your
intention.
let's
assume
you
do
intend
to
litigate
further.
what
for?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
want...
i
want
an
answer
to
my
question.
what
are
you
going
to
litigate
for?
what's
left?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
talking
about
your
case.
what's
left?
justice
david
h.
souter
nothing
is
left.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the...
and
the
concern
is
i
think...
at
least
as
i
understand
the...
the
concern
with
it,
it...
it
boils
down
to
something
like
this.
somebody
comes
along
and
says,
don't
apply
claim
preclusion.
don't
apply
it
because,
for
whatever
reason,
there's
this...
there's
something
wrong
here,
and...
and
federal
court
should
determine
the...
in
fact,
the...
the
claim
preclusion
of
the
state
judgment
should
not
apply.
the
answer
to
that
is,
look,
that's
an
issue
to
be
raised
by
way
of
appeal
of
your
state
judgment.
you
don't
appeal
state
judgments
in
federal
court.
out.
there's
no
such
claim
being
made
here.
the
only
claim
that's
being
made
here
or
the
only
conceivable
claim,
i
guess,
that
can
be
made
here
is
that
we
might
want
to
do
some
litigating
in
the
federal
case
after
the
state
case
is
over.
there's
no
claim
here
that
claim
preclusion
should
not
apply
in
that
instance,
and
because
there's
no
such
argument
that
claim
preclusion
does
not
apply,
the
answer
to
the
problem
that
you're
worried
about
is
simply
claim
preclusion
doctrine.
there's
no
reason
to
add
a
perihelion
or
something
onto
rooker-feldman
to
deal
with
what
is
really
a
very
simple
problem
and
that
is,
if
they
try
to
relitigate
anew
in
federal
court,
as
justice
ginsburg
says,
you...
you
plead
claim
preclusion.
simple.
why
do
we
need
to
complicate
it
beyond
that
simplicity?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
because
the...
it...
it
would
not
rule
out
the
need
to
have
some
answer
when
someone
in
a
federal
court
comes
along
and
says,
don't
apply
claim
preclusion,
whatever
the
reason
may
be.
don't
apply
the
claim
preclusion
rules.
there's
something
unfair
about
doing
it
here.
the
answer
to
that
is,
look,
what
you're
really
asking
us
to
do,
when
you
say
don't
apply
claim
preclusion,
is
to
review
what
happened
in
the
state
court,
and
we
don't
sit
as
an
appellate
court
on
state
courts.
so
there's
still
something
for
rooker-feldman
to
do
on,
as
it
were,
justice...
justice
ginsburg's
claim
preclusion
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
it'll
get
the...
it'll
get
the
job
done
that
you
say
will
need
to
be
done
if
you
get
to
that
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
won't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
then...
then
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then...
then
you
appeal.
don't
ask
for
a
new
body
of
law.
just
say,
look,
you
got
the
application
of
claim
preclusion
wrong
in
this
case.
we're
going
to
appeal.
