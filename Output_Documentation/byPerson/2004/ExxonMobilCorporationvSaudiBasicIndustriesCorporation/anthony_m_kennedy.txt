justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
we'd
like
an
answer.
justice
ginsburg
gives
us...
gives
you
a
hypothetical
case.
you've
got
the
money.
the
judgment
has
been
discharged
in
the
state
courts.
what
is
left
to
do
in
the
federal
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
the
one
answer
i
heard
you
give,
well,
we're
interested
in
preclusion
to
say...
well,
that's
all
historical
at
that
point.
who
cares?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
looking
for...
we're
looking
for
something
that
makes
the
case
live.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we're...
we're
questioning
why
that
is
and
we're
asking
you
what
relief
you
need
to
get
that
you
wouldn't
get
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
ginsburg
posed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
your
answer
that
you
might
want
equitable
relief,
an
injunction
to
continue
making
payments
in
the
future,
or
something
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
that
you
lost
in
the
state
court
and
the
judgment
is
final.
you
then
go
to
federal
court.
are...
is
there
a
context
in
which
rooker-feldman
might
then
be
applicable?
this
is
all
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
if
you
had
some
ongoing
relation
and,
in
this
hypothetical,
the
state
court
ruled
against
you
and
you
went
in
to
try
to
reverse
that
ruling,
that
would
be...
that
would
rooker-feldman.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
happens
thousands
of
times
in...
in
all
of
the
courts.
it's
very
common
and
i
don't
know
why
we're
over
designing
this
vehicle.
it's
simply
other
action
pending.
end
of
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
end
of
argument,
not
end
of
case.
[laughter]
