mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
moot.
there
is
nothing
for
exxon
mobil
to
get
at
this--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--that's
right,
and
that's--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--okay.
well,
i'm...
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
hobson's
choice,
your
honor,
but
i
am
going
to
tell
you,
first
of
all,
that
sabic
is
going
to
apply
for
cert..
at
least
that's
my
current
understanding.
and
second
of
all,
that
shows
why
this
case
is
not
justiciable
at
this
point
because
if
the
most
likely
event
in
the...
in
the
event
of
this
court's
review
of
the
delaware
determination,
is
a
reversal
on
a
statute
of
limitations
problem.
that's
the
reason
this
suit
was
brought
as
the,
quote,
insurance
policy
that
the
third
circuit
identified,
which
was
if
the
delaware
supreme
court
or
the
delaware
superior
court
had
kicked
this
suit
on
the
ground
of
the
3-year
statute
of
limitations...
and
if
you
look
at
page
20a
of
the
supplemental
brief,
the
corrected
supplemental
brief
that
we
filed
with
the
court,
including
the
delaware
supreme
court's
opinion,
you'll
see
that
they
had
a
whale
of
a
time
getting
over
the
plain
language
of
their
own
statute.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
my
response,
justice
breyer,
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
mootness
question,
if
that
eventuality
occurs,
that's
the
time
when
there
may
be
a
justiciable
issue
for
a
federal
district
court.
not
now.
we've
been
talking
about
ifs
and
hypotheticals
and
what
may
happen
in
the
future.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
we've
never
disputed
that,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
right.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
justice
ginsburg,
preclusion
doctrine
may
accomplish
this
in
a
certain
number
of
cases,
but
i
think
it's
important...
and
i
think
i
have
to
correct
my
colleague
on
the
other
side
here
with
regard
to
the
state
of
the
record.
yes,
there
was
a
stay
of
the
new
jersey
ii
trial
court
litigation,
but
it
wasn't
because
of
the
colorado
river
application
that
we
made.
in
fact,
if
you'll
look
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--well,
i...
i
think,
your
honor,
you
will
see
that
that
is
a
component
of
colorado
river,
and
that
was
part
of
the
application
that
we
made
to
the
district
court
in
this
case
under
colorado
river.
and
my
only
answer...
the
only
reason
that
i'm
bringing
this
up,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
if
you'll
look
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
you
will
see
that
sabic,
my
client,
made
an
application
for
colorado
river
abstention,
and
the
district
court
denied
that.
the
district
court
denied
that
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
it
was...
it
was...
if
you'll
look
at...
i
believe
this
is
at
page
8a
of
the
addendum
to
the
red
brief.
you'll
see
that
it
was
exxon
mobil
that
pushed
in
delaware,
but
that
actually
happened
before
the
ruling
on
sovereign
immunity,
that...
that
they
elected
to
go
forward
in
delaware.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
right.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
we...
that
is
true
that
we
brought
the
initial
case,
but
the
case
was
eventually
tried
on
their
counterclaims.
the
case
was
inverted
to
make
them
the
party
plaintiff.
they
went
first
at
trial
and
is
it...
at
the
page
i
cited
to
you,
that
was
where
they
decided
to
go
forward
with
the
delaware
case.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
that...
that
is
absolutely
the
case
with
regard
to
the
delaware
matter.
but
i
think
what
your
question
is
getting
at...
and
i
think
i
have
to
go
back
a
couple
of
minutes
in
our
colloquy
here
to
talk
about
why
abstention
won't
do
the
work
in
this
case.
in
the
lion's
share
of
cases,
it
probably
will,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
it
didn't.
and
this
brings
me
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
which
said...
in
which
he
said
that...
that
concurrent
jurisdiction
has
always
bothered
him
because
what
you're
ending
up
with
is
a
race
to
judgment.
but
it's
important
again,
justice
breyer.
it's
a
race
to
judgment.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
justice
kennedy--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--justice
breyer,
i
think
this
is
the
point
in
the
argument
where
i
want
to
turn
to
the
definition
of
review
as
this
court
has...
has
put
it
forth
in
cases
like
asarco.
this
is
a
case
that
exxon
mobil
dismisses
in
their
reply
brief
as
mere
dictum.
i
don't
think
that
this...
the
discussion
of
rooker-feldman
and
the
asarco
case
can
be
dismissed
as
dictum
in
that
it
was
a
specific
response
to
a
specific
proposal
by
the
united
states
appearing
as
amicus
to
dismiss
the
case
for
lack
of
standing
and
instead
remit
the
plaintiffs
to
pursuing
a
second
suit.
in
that
case,
the
court
wrote
that
to
readjudicate...
and
i'm
quoting
here
from
the
opinion,
and
i
don't
have
the
particular
page
here...
to
readjudicate
the
very
same
issues
that
were
determined
in
the
state
court
proceedings
would
be...
again
quoting...
in
essence,
an
attempt
to
obtain
direct
review
of
the
arizona
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
lower
federal
courts.
in
asarco,
there
was
no
reference
to
what
the
intent
of
the
plaintiffs
was.
there
was
no
reference
to
what
the
timing
of
the
lawsuits
was.
it
was
simply
that
identical
issues
actually
litigated.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
first
of
all,
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
hesitant
to
say
that
this
court
was
incautious
in
its
use
of
words.
this
was--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--but...
understandably,
but...
but
with
regard
to...
with
regard
to
rooker-feldman,
it
was
not
just...
it
was
not
just
an
accidental...
incidental
invocation
of
it.
it
was
the
reason
for
the
rejection
of
the
argument.
the
reason
was
not
res
judicata.
the
reason
was
respect
for
the
dignity
of
the
state
court's
work
in
the
case,
and
that's
ultimately--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--that's...
that's...
that
is...
that
is
generally
right,
justice
ginsburg,
but
at
the
same
time,
there...
we
all
agree...
exxon
mobil,
sabic,
and
the
decisions
of
this
court...
that
there
has
to
be
some
overlap
with
regard
to
rooker-feldman
and
sabic...
and...
excuse
me...
and...
and
preclusion
doctrine.
the...
the
argument
made
by
exxon
mobil,
which
is,
in
essence,
the
same
question
you're
asking
me,
would
have
destroyed
any
reason
whatsoever
for
the
rooker
and
the
feldman
cases,
as
well
as
the
asarco
case.
there's
also
a
significant
body
of
law
that's
body
of
law
that's
been
built
up
over
the
last
85
years
in
the
lower
courts
in...
in
this
regard.
and--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--well,
i...
i
guess
in
that
respect,
justice
o'connor,
i
disagree
because
the
third
circuit,
admitted
by
its
own
words,
applies
a
very
narrow
version
of
rooker-feldman.
and,
in
fact,
using
this
case
as
the
vehicle
to
decide
this,
the...
the
definition
of
rooker-feldman
in
this
instance
amounts
to
no
more
than
barring
jurisdiction
in
a
second
federal
suit
over
the
identical
claims.
this
is
not
a
case
where
you
have
to
worry
about
claims
that
might
have
been
brought,
the
sort
of
things
that
footnote
16
in
feldman
dealt
with.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--well,
to
be
sure,
justice
o'connor,
the
third
circuit's
view
is
broader
than
that
which
appears
to
be
adopted
by
the
ninth
circuit,
as
well
as
the
seventh
circuit.
and
i
think
this
brings
me
back
to
the
definition
of
review.
the...
the
ninth
and
seventh
circuits'
views
in
our
estimation
are
wrong
because
they
strictly
look
to
the
subjective
intent
of
the
plaintiff
and
as
to
whether
the
plaintiff
is,
in
fact,
seeking
reversal.
that...
that's
the
term
that's
used
in
these
cases.
noel
says
seeking
to
set
aside.
but
section
1257--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--and
that's
because,
justice
stevens,
that's...
that
was
the
particular
fact
pattern
of
this...
of
that
case.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
that's...
in
the
supreme
court,
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
justice
souter,
i...
i
don't
have
any
qualms
with
the
application
of
claim
preclusion
here.
the...
the
third
circuit,
though,
was
being...
was
being
sensitive
to
the
interests
of
the
state
courts,
as
well
as
sensitive
to
the
fact
that
it
had
another
jurisdictional
issue
in
front
of
it,
which
was
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
the
fsia.
and
i'm...
i'm
certain,
as
certain
can
be,
that
that
court
would
have
reached
the
same
result
if
res
judicata
had
been
before
it.
but
the...
the
fact
is
that
rooker-feldman
is
there
and,
again,
as...
as
with
my
response
to
justice
ginsburg
earlier,
your...
your
question
would
effectively
rub
out
any
need
for
even
rooker
and
feldman
themselves.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
justice
souter,
i
think
again,
with
respect
to
the
hypothetical
that
you've
put
to
me,
the
claim
preclusion
is
appropriately--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--it...
it
should
get
the
job
done.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
there...
there
are...
first
of
all,
there
are
no
guarantees.
the...
the
preclusion
doctrines
are...
are
riddled
with
exceptions.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
the
preclusion
doctrine--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--i...
i
disagree,
justice
souter,
that...
that
we're
asking
for
anything
like
a
huge,
new
body
of
law
or
that
the
third
circuit
was
making
a
huge,
new
body
of
law.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg,
but
it's
true
because
of
the
briefing
cycle.
when
we
briefed
the
case,
there
was
no
delaware
judgment.
and
it
was
only
on
the
eve
of
oral
argument--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--yes.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
or
the
other
side
is
going
to
give
up.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
justice
scalia,
in
the...
in
the
realm
that
we're
talking
about
here,
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
the
friedman's
case
came
to
a
mootness
conclusion.
we've
also
cited
in
our
brief...
and
i
don't
recall
the
names
of
them
off
the
top
of
my
head...
two
cases
in
which
the
court
either...
either
dismissed
or
remanded
for
consideration
of
mootness
in
light
of
another
state
court
judgment.
so
i
think
there
is...
there
is
a
body
of
law,
but
i
also
know
that
it
is...
as
recently
as
yesterday
looking
at
wright
and
miller
on
this
issue,
that
when
complete
relief
has
been
accorded
by
another
tribunal,
that
is
the
classic
case
of
mootness.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
and
again,
i'm...
i'm
certainly
not
going
to
fight
claim
preclusion
because
this
is
a
suit
that
should
not
be
here.
this
is...
this
has
had
moving
parts
since
we...
since
the
petition
was
granted
with
the
delaware
supreme
court
ruling
and
now
with
yesterday's
denial
of
reargument
in
the
delaware
supreme
court.
what--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
the...
the...
there
could
be...
there
could
be
issue
preclusive
grounds
on
such
a
ruling,
justice
breyer,
but...
but--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--i...
i
don't
think
i
could
say
that
at
this
point
because--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--and...
and
that
is
a
future
event.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
i...
i
guess,
justice
breyer--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--i
don't
think
it's
right.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
and...
and
i
think
the
reason
it's
not
right
is
because
that
just
shows
that
there's
no
live
controversy
right
now.
that's
a
controversy
that
might
happen
in
the
future.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
two
answers
to
that,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
that
seems
to
be
a...
a
place
for
state
doctrines
of
tolling
to
apply,
not
federal
law.
second
of
all,
this
court
in...
in
heck
against
humphrey,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
solves
this--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
and
indeed,
you
did,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
i...
i've
also
gotten
that
impression.
but...
but
heck
i
think
teaches
an
important...
heck
teaches
an
important
lesson
for
this
case
as
well,
which
is
that
heck
was
just
a
suit
for
money
damages,
just
like
this
suit.
and...
and
yet,
this
court
said
that
there's
going
to
be
no
cause
of
action
under
section
1983
because
of
the
intersection
of
1983
and
habeas.
well,
we
have
the
same
result
here.
there
should
be
no
federal
court
case
here
because
of
the
intersection
of
section
1257--
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
--no,
and
in
fact,
the
case
that's
cited
against
us
for
that
proposition,
the
freeport-mcmoran
case,
makes
clear,
in
the
portion
of
it
not
cited
by
exxon
mobil,
that
that
rule
is
limited
to
the
diversity
context.
and
it's
not...
it...
it
does
not
have
its
genesis
in
statute,
but
it's
in
policy.
we
don't
want
to
keep
people
from
moving
across
state
lines.
we
don't
want
to...
want
to
impede
their...
their
free
movement.
so
we're
going
to
look
at
it
at
the
time
of
filing.
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
case
where
maybe
it
was
original
jurisdiction
when
the
case
was
filed,
but
it's
not
original
anymore.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
in
this
case,
yes.
in
this
case,
yes.
but
original
jurisdiction
when
the
case
was
filed
but
not
anymore
because
there's
nothing
original
about
it.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
i
guess
i
come
back
to...
to
where
i
started
with
justice
breyer
on
the...
on
the
merits
of
the
rooker-feldman
issue
this
morning,
which
is
that
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
is
something
to
be
dealt
with.
this
court
has
an
uneasy
body
of
law
in
the
abstention
area
dealing
with
the
issue
of
concurrent
jurisdiction,
but
what
it
doesn't
have
is
anything
that
deals
with
judgments,
once
you
get
to
a
judgment.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
well,
i...
i
would
have
to
say
that
feldman,
of
the
two
of
them,
is
probably
stronger
support.
mr.
gregory
andrew
castanias
that's
right.
but
at
the
same
time,
the...
the
rooker
case
also
dealt
with
relitigation
of
the
identical
issues.
and
if
i
could
just
sum
up
here,
seeing
that
the
light
is
on
here,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
limited
to
identical
lawsuits,
identical
claims.
the
third
circuit's
decision
in
this
case,
if
it
constitutes
an
extension
of
rooker-feldman
at
all,
is
only
a
modest
extension
because
it
recognizes,
consistent
with
asarco,
consistent
with
heck,
and
consistent
with
the
very
notion,
justice
souter,
of
de
facto
appeals,
not
actual
appeals,
but
de
facto
appeals
being
prohibited
by
the
doctrine...
it
recognizes
that
claims
actually
litigated
in
a
state
suit
to
a
judgment,
if
they
are
litigated
anew
