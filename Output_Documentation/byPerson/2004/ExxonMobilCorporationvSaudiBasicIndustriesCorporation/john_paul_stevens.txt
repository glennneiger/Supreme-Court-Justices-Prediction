justice
john
paul
stevens
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
exxon
mobil
against
saudi
basic
industries.
mr.
coleman,
i
trust
you
will
soon
tell
us
why
the
case
is
not
moot
or
whether
you
think
it's
moot,
and
if...
if
not,
why
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
relief
could
it
give
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
relief?
if
you're
paid
in
full,
what...
what
relief
are
you
entitled
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
issues
would...
would
the
district
court
resolve?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
coleman,
can
i
interrupt
with
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
position
that
what
should
have
been
done
in
this
case,
not
in
the
hypothetical
case,
is
the
trial
court
should
have
just
stayed
the
action
pending
the
outcome
of
the
delaware
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what...
he
did...
that
was
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
when
the
delaware
case
was
over,
then
what
should
he
have
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
he
has
given
you
all
the
relief
your
entitled
to.
therefore,
you
go
ahead
and
dismiss
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
therefore,
my
next
question
is
why
shouldn't
we
do
exactly
that
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
we
could
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
say
that
was
wrong,
but
still,
order
it
dismissed
after
we
vacate
the
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
don't
tell
us
what
issue
remains,
i
don't
know
why
we
shouldn't
just
direct
the
suit
to
be
dismissed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
do
so.
mr.
castanias.
i
hope
you'll
tell
us
also
whether
you
think
the
case
is
moot
before
you're
through.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that's
the
language
that
was
used
in
both
rooker
and
feldman
too
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
the
only
fact
pattern
any
of
our
cases
have
dealt
with.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you?
it's
perhaps
an
unfair
question.
the
chief
justice
generally
likes
to
confine
our
attention
to
cases
of
this
court
rather
than
the
courts
of
appeals
for
our
primary
guidance,
and
most
of
the
rooker-feldman
law
is
court
of
appeals
law,
as
we...
we
both
know.
going
back
just
to
rooker
and
to
feldman,
those
two
cases,
and
putting
aside
asarco
for
a
minute,
which
of
those
two
cases
do
you
think
provides
you
the
stronger
support,
if
indeed
any
support,
between
rooker
and
feldman?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
the
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
was
itself
a
party
to
the
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
castanias.
mr.
coleman,
you
have
8
and
a
half
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
coleman,
i
don't
mean
to
take
your
time,
but
in
the
asarco
case,
was
the
state
court
judgment
final
at
the
time
in
dispute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
the
judgment
were
final,
then
that
would
fit
right
into
your...
your
analysis,
if
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
were
final.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
