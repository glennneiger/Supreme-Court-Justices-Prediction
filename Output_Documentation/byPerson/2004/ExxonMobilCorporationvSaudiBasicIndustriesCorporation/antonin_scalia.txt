who
cares?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
how
many
claims
in
this
case
that...
that
were
not
in
the
delaware
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
castanias--
justice
antonin
scalia
--could...
could
i
come
back
to
mootness?
one...
one
could
say
that
not
only
is
claim
preclusion
the
answer
to
rooker-feldman,
it's
also
the
answer
to
the
asserted
mootness
here.
i
mean,
you...
you
don't
have
to
move
to
dismiss
it
as
moot.
all
you
have
to
do
is
move
to
dismiss
because
of
a
prior
adjudication
that
has
resolved
this
question.
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
existence
of
a
prior
judgment
in
another
court
has
been
held
to
render
a
suit
that
someone
wants
to
press
to
get
a
second
judgment
moot?
i
mean,
you'd
think
there
would
be
a
case
on
that,
and
i
suppose
the
reason
there
isn't
is
that
because
the
other
side
is
always
going
to
plead
res
judicata.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
give
up.
but
is
there
any
case
in
which
mootness
is
established
by
the
fact
that
there
is
a
prior
judgment
of
another
court
giving
you
what
you
are
asking
for
from
this
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
don't
know
why...
well,
if
it's...
if
it
were
so
classic,
there
would
be
a
lot
of
cases,
and
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
that
any
of
yours
are
right
on
point.
and...
and
i
think
the
reason
is
that
you
don't
need
it,
that
claim
preclusion
is...
is
the
remedy
for
the
party
who
wants
to
get
out
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
i
wrote
that
opinion.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
never
did
like
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
depends
on
who
wins.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
you
lost
in
the
other
suit,
your
claim
here
wouldn't
be
moot.
i
mean,
it...
it
would
be
precluded,
but
it's
certainly
not
moot.
