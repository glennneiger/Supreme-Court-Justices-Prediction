ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
answer
to
your
question
first,
justice
breyer,
the
twenty-first
amendment
does
not
impose
a
nondiscriminatory
ban.
the
court
rejected
that
position,
not
just
in
young's
market
and
mahoney
in
indianapolis,
but
also
in
clark
distilling,
the
case
in
which
the
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
webb-kenyon
act,
itself.
it
held
that
the
webb-kenyon
act
operated
to
remove
any
immunity
that
had
been
conferred
by
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
bacchus
is
not
to
the
contrary.
in
north
dakota,
which
follows
bacchus,
the
court
relied
again
on
young's
market
to
say
that
the
states
could
impose
different
rules
on
out-of-state
vendors
where
they
were
necessary
to
protect
the
integrity--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--the
express
terms
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
would
allow
that
if...
particularly
if
it
were
necessary
to
advance
the
concerns
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
for
example--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--simply
for
mere
protectionism?
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
the
terms
of
the
amendment
would
allow
that,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
explore
the
outer
parameters
of
the
twenty-first--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--it
could
be
done,
but
that
question
really
isn't
presented
here,
because--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--that's
a
difficult
question,
because--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--let
me
answer
both
of
those
questions,
if
i
can,
your
honor.
certainly,
this
court
has
held,
repeatedly,
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
did
not,
in
any
substantial
way,
completely
repeal
congress'
affirmative
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
said
that
in
midcal
and
capital
cities.
but
we
would
argue
that
if
congress
acted
in
a
way
which
completely
removed
state
authority
to
determine
whether
or
not
alcohol
could
be
sold
and
the
terms
under
which
it
could
be
sold...
for
example,
if
congress
said
all
states
must
be
dry...
then
we
would
argue
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
wouldn't
allow
that,
because
that
would
completely
eviscerate
any
state
authority.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
intended
to
eliminate
the
impediments
posed
by
the
dormant
commerce
clause
and
authorize
states
to
regulate
it.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
by
terms
of
our--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that...
again,
i
don't
think
that
you
need
to
decide
those
questions
in
this
case.
this
case
goes
to
what's
at
the
very
core
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
whether
states
can
decide
who
can
sell
liquor
to
their
citizens
and
whether
or
not
states--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--north
dakota
indicates
otherwise,
i
believe,
your
honor.
in
north
dakota,
this
court
said
that,
because,
when
alcohol
flows
across
the
border,
it
poses
unique
risks
to
the
regulatory
regime,
because
the
state
can't
bring
the
alcohol
within
the
full
extent
of
its
regulatory
and
supervisory
powers,
that
it
may
be
appropriate
and
necessary
for
states
to
impose
unique
rules
on
out-of-state
vendors.
in
north
dakota,
the
court
did
not
say--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--but
there
is
good
reason--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--there
is
good
reason
here,
your
honor.
what's
critical
about
new
york's
law,
as
well
as
michigan's
law,
is
that
it
requires
that
any
alcohol
vendor
have
a
physical
presence
in
the
state.
and
that's
important
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
state
can't
meaningfully
oversee
traffic
in
alcohol
with
an
out-of-state
entity.
petitioner
suggested--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--it
is
wrong,
your
honor.
it's
certainly
not
the
case
that
we
have
an
sla
inspector
outside
every
entity
that
sells
liquor.
that
would
not
be
possible.
but
it
is
true
that
the
state
liquor
authority
can,
and
does,
physically
inspect
the
premises.
they
do
so
to
determine
whether--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--well,
more
than
that,
and
this
is
why
the
physical
presence
is
important
and
why
the
internet
hypothetical
that
your
honor
raised
would
not...
would
not
satisfy
the
state's
concerns.
what
the
state
can
do
is,
it
can
go
onto
a
premises,
and
it
can
count
whether
the
bottles
on
the
shelves
of
that
premises
match
the
records.
that's
the
best
way
to
detect
whether
or
not
there
is
evasion.
because
if
you
have--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--there
is
not
clear
evidence
in
the
record
with
respect
to
that...
to
that
level
of
detail,
but
that--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--your
honor,
there
is
material
in
the
mckeon
affidavit,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix...
mr.
mckeon
is
the
chair
of
the
state
liquor
authority...
but
it's
also
the
case
that
to
suggest
that
because
there
is
some
option
out
there...
and
there's
no
firm
evidence
that
a
less
prescriptive
rule
would,
in
fact,
satisfy
the
state's
concerns
in
preventing
diversion
and
tax
evasion...
but
the
possibility
that's
there's
some
rule
out
there,
because
other
states
have
adopted
more
lax
rules,
is
to
treat
alcohol
like
any
other
product.
and
the
twenty-first
amendment
reflects
a
consensus
by
this
nation
that
alcohol
is
unique,
that
it
should
not
be
open
to--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--yes--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--they
also
draw
on
the
assistance
of
local
law
enforcement.
and
this
is
also--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--set
forth--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
that's...
the
state
laws
requires
that
any
licensed
winery
have
a
government-bonded
storehouse
or
ware-room...
storehouse...
storeroom
or
warehouse,
pardon
me--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--the
reason
for
that
is
because
physical
products--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--yes,
your
honor.
the
state
liquor
authority
has
not
issued
any
regulations
on
this,
but
presumably
what
they
would
say
is,
you
could
share
a
space,
provided
that
the
physical
property
of
each
winery,
the
bottles,
is
segregated
so
that
the
states
can
come
in
and
check
whether
or
not
each
winery's
products
conform
with
their
records.
there
are
other
reasons
why
a
physical
presence
is
important,
as
well.
first
of
all,
the
state
draws
on
local
law
enforcement
extensively
to
identify
illegal
activities,
and
that
would
not
be
possible
with
any
entity
located
out-of-state.
additionally--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--it
could
be
selling
to
minors,
but
it
could
also
simply
be
sale
out
of
an
unlicensed
premises,
where
you
are
selling
outside
the
proper
hours
of
sale,
or
sale
outside
of
the
three-tier
system--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--but,
your
honor,
the
principle
that
having
entities
that
sell
liquor
be
licensed,
is
one
that
is
at
the
heart,
not
just
at
the--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--it--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--it--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--right.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
it
can't
prevent
it
a
hundred
percent,
but
no--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--your
honor,
it
can
deter
it,
and
it
can
deter
it
significantly,
because,
first
of
all,
there
is
a
much
more
significant
opportunity
to
identify
the
illegal
activities;
and,
secondly,
if
a
retailer
or
a
wholesaler
or
a
manufacturer
knows
that,
that
operates
as
a
powerful
deterrent--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--to
be
clear,
the
state
has
not
issued
regulations
that
specifically
address
that
point,
because--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--we
don't
know.
but
in
talking
with
the
state
liquor
authority,
they
have
made
it
clear
that
their
intent
would
be
to
require
that
the
liquor
come
first
to
the
in-state
premises--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--there
is
no
guarantee,
your
honor,
but
there
is
never
any
guarantee--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--that
people
won't--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--that,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with.
it
does
operate
as
a
powerful
deterrent
and--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--as
an
investigative
aid.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
that's
one
of
the
points,
but
also
that
we're
much
more
likely
to
be
able
to
identify
the
illegal
activities
in
the
first
place.
the
suggestion
that
we
would
send
inspectors
to
california
or
any
other
place
to
look
at
books
and
count
bottles
is
completely
infeasible.
and
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
intended
to
allow
states
to
deal
with
the
regulatory
challenges
that
are
posed
when
liquor
comes
across
the
border.
if
we
had
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
a
hundred-percent
compliance,
then
we
couldn't
have
any
regulation
at
all.
that's
not,
i
would
submit,
a--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--reasonable
measure.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
they--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--we're
not
suggesting
that,
your
honor.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
relying
on
other
states
to
enforce
law
violations
in
new
york
state
is
not
a
very
feasible
alternative.
additionally,
there
are
33
states
that
have
agreed
with
new
york,
a
number
of
whom
are
states
that
have
either
reciprocal
or
unrestricted
shipping
statutes,
and
said
to
this
court,
"please
do
not
prohibit
the
kinds
of
laws
that
are
at
issue
in
new
york
and
michigan.
"
so
it's
obviously
important
to
the
regulators
in
those
states,
as
well.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i
can't--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--i
believe
that
the
current
number
is
26
states.
i
certainly
can't
speak
to
the
regulatory
motivations
of
each
of
those
states,
or
the
reasons
why
those
laws
might
have
been
passed.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
well,
a
number
of
those
states
have,
in
fact,
joined
new
york
and
michigan
in
asking
the
court
not
to--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--restrict
that.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
your
honor,
i
think
that
all
the
twenty-first
amendment
requires
the
states
to
demonstrate
is
that
the
regulatory
regime
that
they
have
chosen
has
some
relationship
to
their
goals
of
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
state's
system.
and
that's
certainly
what
the
court
suggested
in
north
dakota.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
well,
that
was
the
case
in
north
dakota,
as
well.
in
north
dakota,
the
state
imposed
regulations
on
out-of-state
vendors
that
were
extremely
onerous,
so
onerous
that
some
vendors
said
they
wouldn't
ship
products
at
all.
that
was
alcohol
that
was
not
even
destined
for
consumption
within
the
state;
but
on
a
federal
enclave.
and
the
mere
risk
of
diversion
into
unregulated
and
unlawful
channels
was
enough
to
allow
the
state
to
impose
those
discriminatory
rules.
the
same
is
true
here.
justice
o'connor,
you
also
asked
about
bacchus,
as
well,
and
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
to
address
that.
bacchus
is
distinguishable
in
several
ways.
first
of
all,
bacchus
was
a
tax.
and
while
we
would
argue
that
taxes
could
be
used
to
further
states'
interest
in
suppressing
consumption,
for
example,
it
is
certainly
not
at
the
heart
of
the...
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
the
way
that
the
direct
regulation
of
alcohol
across
the
border
is.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i,
respectfully,
would
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
if
you
can't
address
the
alcohol
that
flows
across
the
border,
which
was
precisely
why
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
enacted,
as
well
as
webb-kenyon,
because
the--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--well,
we
would
certainly,
you
know,
welcome
the
authority
to
do
both,
but
importation
is
what
is
at
the
heart
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
bacchus
is
also
different,
because,
there,
the
state
made
no
effort
whatsoever
to
defend
the
statute
with
reference
to
any
concerns
related
to
the
twenty-first
amendment.
and
bacchus--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--that
was
an
off-the-cuff
remark
by
a
single
attorney,
your
honor,
and
that
can't
be
taken
as
dispositive,
given
the
state's
vigorous
defense
of
this
statute.
it
also
was
regarding
a
provision
that
is
not
even
directly
before
the
court
right
now
which
confers
no
different
shipment
privileges
than
are
conferred
on
any
winery,
whether
in-state
or
out-of-state,
that
would
obtain
a
license
to
sell
in
new
york.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
thank
you,
your
honor.
