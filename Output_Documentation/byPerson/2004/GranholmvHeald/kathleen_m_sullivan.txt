ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
nothing
in
today's
case,
justice
kennedy,
requires
you
to
take
on
the
three-tier
system,
for
the
issue
that
is
presented
here
is
a
very
narrow
one.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
all
that
we
ask
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
you
strike
down
michigan
and
new
york's
decision
to
apply
the
three-tier
system
to
everyone
except
their
own
in-state--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--producers
of
wine--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
kennedy,
in
our
case,
we
want
to
suggest
that
it
is...
just
as
in
healy
and
bacchus...
that
a
law
that
discriminates
in
favor
of
in-state
producers
and
against
out-of-state
producers
loses
its
immunity
afforded
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
as
justice
scalia
said
in
concurrence
in
healy,
a
liquor
law's
discriminatory
character
eliminates
the
immunity
afforded
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
it's
really
the
state's
position,
aided
by
their
wholesaler
allies,
that
it
is
the
sweeping
one.
their
position
is
that
every
state
law
that
regulates
the
importation
of
liquor
is,
per
se,
valid
if
it
has
any
conceivable
rational
connection
to
a
state
purpose.
so,
for
example,
if
michigan
wanted
to
simply
bar
all
california
wines,
facially
exclude
california
wines,
saying,
"there
are
too
many
of
them,
it
interferes
with
orally
market
conditions--
"
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that's
exactly
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
as
you've
said
in
the
context
of
gender
discrimination,
you
can
cure
an
equal-protection
problem
by
leveling
up
or
leveling
down.
in
this
case,
we
would
suggest
that
the
principle
of
free
trade
that
was
the
reason,
the
principal
reason,
for
the
framing
of
the
constitution
and
has
been
reflected
in
over
a
century
of
dormant
commerce
clause
jurisprudence,
suggests
that
you
should...
the
remedy
should
be
to
open
the
markets
to
out-of-state
producers--
but
that's
an
issue
that
can
be
addressed
on
remit.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--correct,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
if
it
were
in
aid,
and
only
if
it
were
in
aid,
of
the
states...
and
necessary
to
serve
the
state's
internal
purposes.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--the
state
can
have
a
monopoly
if
it's,
itself,
a
market
participant.
what
the
state
may--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--private--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
stevens,
a
state
may
not
discriminate
against
out-of-staters
for
the
sole
purpose
of
economic
protectionism.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
in
young's
market.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
correct.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
but
justice--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--but--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
breyer,
the
young's
market
language
permitting
state
discrimination
is,
indeed,
broad,
but
it's
been
superceded
by
40
years
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
harmonizing
the
twenty-first
amendment
with
the
rest
of
the
constitution.
remember,
justice
brandeis,
in
young's
market,
didn't
even
think
the
equal
protection
clause
applied
to
liquor
imports,
a
position
that's
inconsistent
with
craig
against
boren.
and
nobody
would
suggest
today
that
equal
protection
permits
a
state
to
import
only
from
male-owned
wineries
or
only
import
wine
from
white-owned
wineries.
so
there...
the
40
years
of
jurisprudence--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--has
been--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--correct,
your
honor,
but
if...
if
there
were
a
law...
the
states
are
claiming
that
any
law
governing--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--but
the
dormant
commerce
clause
reflects
a
fundamental
structural
principle
that
is
every
bit
as
much
a
part
of
the
constitution
as
the
equal
protection
clause
upheld
in
craig
v.
boren.
indeed
this
court,
in
cases
from
mcculloch
to
the
eleventh
amendment
cases
and
state
sovereignty
cases,
has
recognized
that
a
principle
of
the
constitution
is
no
less
fundamental
because
it
is
a
structural
implication
of
the
text.
so
the
dormant
commerce
clause
stands
on
the
same
footing
as
the
affirmative
power
of
congress
and
on...
it's
the
same
footing
as
the
equal
protection
clause
at
issue--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--in
craig
v.
boren--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--absolutely,
but
it
has
not.
and
the
wilson
act...
to
go
back
to
justice
souter's
question
and
justice
ginsburg's
question...
congress
could
authorize
it
as
it
has
done,
for
example,
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
allowing
the
states
to
discriminate
against
out-of-state
industry
with
respect
to
the
industry
of
insurance.
it
has
not
done
so
here.
webb-kenyon
did
not
authorize
discrimination,
and
the
wilson
act
forbade
discrimination
for
just...
reasons
justice
ginsburg
described.
it
said
you
may
regulate
imports
of
liquor
in
the
same
manner
as
local
liquor
laws.
and,
of
course,
the
purpose
of
section
2
was
to
allow
to
the
dry
states
to
keep
dry
by
preventing
all
those
original
packages
from
piling
up
in
the
railway
stations
and
being
open
to
bootleggers
throughout
the
state,
undermining
the
dry
policies
of
the
state.
wilson
forbade
discrimination.
web
kenyan
didn't
authorize
it.
and
in
congress'
most
recent
articulation
of
its
view
of
the
harmony
between
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
the
rest
of
the
constitution,
the
twenty-first
amendment
enforcement
act,
passed
in
2000,
enacted
in
2000,
congress
has
a
rules-of-construction
section
that
says,
"we
view
any
state
plea
to
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
their
laws
as
reflecting
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court.
"
and,
in
fact,
floor
debate
on
that
rules-of-construction
section
reflected
allusions
to
bacchus,
healy,
and
the
other
cases
that
said
dormant
commerce...
the
negative
implications
of
the
commerce
clause,
no
less
than
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
due
process
clause
or
the
establishment
clause,
constrain
the
states
in
their
regulation
of
importation
of
liquor.
so
with
all
respect
to
justice
brandeis,
justice
breyer,
the
young's
market
statements
about
discrimination
have
been
superceded.
what
new
york
and
michigan
have
done
here
is
say
that
one
set
of
exceptions
apply
only
to
in-state
producers,
just
as
connecticut,
in
healy,
said,
"if
you
just
sell
beer
within
our
state,
you
don't
have
to
face
price
ceilings
that
you
have
to
face
if
you
do
business
over
in
massachusetts
or
rhode
island.
"
just
as
in
bacchus,
the...
you
struck
down
a
decision...
an
excise
tax
exemption
that
said,
"if
you're
an
importer
of
liquor,
you
have
to
pay
an
excise
tax,
but
if
you're
a
local
producer
of
locally
produced
wine
and
spirits,
you
get
out
of
that
restriction.
"
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
souter,
we
believe
the
standard
should
be
strict
scrutiny,
though
there
must
be
a
necessity
to
serve--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--a
legitimate--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--because
it's
facial
discrimination.
it's
absolutely
undisputed.
michigan...
in
fact,
michigan
state
concedes
that
they
have
flatly
banned
out-of-state
wineries
from
shipping
directly
to
consumers.
there's
no
question
that
this
is
facially
discriminatory.
but
even
if
the
standard
were
a
more
deferential
one
in
which
all
the
state
needed
to
show
was
a
reasonable
need
for
discrimination,
it
can't
come
close
to
doing
that
here.
neither
michigan
nor
new
york
has
shown
that
the
facial
discrimination
here
is
necessary
to
protect
minors
or
to
protect
the
collection
of
taxes.
let's
start
with
minors.
the
michigan
claim
that
it's
protecting
against
under-18
sales
is
belied
by
the
fact
that
michigan
is
allowing
40
michigan
wineries
and,
at
last
count,
7500
michigan
retailers
to
deliver
directly
to
consumers.
the
way
to
protect
my...
so
just
as
in
craig
v.
boren,
the
exception
for
young
women
to
drink
3.2
beer,
as
opposed
to
young
men,
belied
the
state's
interest
in
temperance.
so
the
pattern
of
exceptions
here
that
michigan
has
created
belies
any
notion
that
it's
protecting
under-18-year-olds
from
drinking.
and,
of
course--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--on
revenue,
the
nondiscriminatory
means
that's
available
to
the
state
that
michigan
and
new
york
have
not
shown
any
reason
to
reject...
26
states
have
adopted
some
version
of
this...
is
to
require
an
out-of-state
winery
to
get
a
permit.
and
that's
a...
justice
breyer,
one
thing
that's
still
left
of
brandeis.
you
can
require
a
permit
from
an
out-of-state
winery,
which
would
be
unusual
to
acquire
from
widgets
or
milk.
but
you
can
require
a
permit,
and,
as
a
condition
of
the
permit,
justice
souter.
the
out-of-state
winery
has
to
agree
to
submit
to
the
state's
jurisdiction,
to
submit
to
the
state's
tax
jurisdiction.
and,
justice
kennedy,
whether
or
not
quill
would
permit
taxation
if
you
were
simply
sending
by
common
carrier,
our
clients
want
to...
want
to
pay
taxes,
want
to
sign
up
for
permits,
want
to
play
on
a--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--level
playing
field--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--but,
justice
souter,
to...
look
at
the
experience--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--they
certainly
don't,
justice
souter,
but
new
hampshire
is
a
state
that
has
actually...
your
own
state
is
a
state
that
has
on
its
web
site
a
set
of
out-of-state
wineries.
it
requires
that
they
keep
and
supply
sales
records
on
a
monthly
basis,
that
they
keep
those
records
for
three
years--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--i--
[laughter]
--think
new
hampshire's
done
very
well
collecting
taxes
from
out-of-state
producers,
justice
souter.
it's
a
leader--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--in
the
field.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's
correct.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
but
to
go
back
to
the
physical-presence
question,
justice
souter,
michigan
is
not
now...
michigan
officials
are
not
now
traipsing
up
to
the
upper
peninsula
and
all
around
the
state
to
inspect
wineries.
the
record
is
clear
on
that.
what
michigan
does
is
require
that
wineries
in
michigan
send
samples
and
records
to
their
offices.
and
the
internet
actually,
if
anything...
the
states
say
that
the
internet
increases
the
danger,
but
the
internet
also
increases,
in
parallel,
the
power
of
the
states
to
police
out-of-state
wineries
without
an
in-state
presence.
just
as,
justice
stevens,
the
internet
may
make
every
speaker
with
a
pc
a
town
crier,
as
you
said--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--in
reno
versus
aclu--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--so
it
makes
every
interstate--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--yes,
justice
souter,
if
it
were
part
of
a...
an
agreement
to
a
permit
that
the...
that
the
out-of-state
winery
is
willing
to
make,
then
there's
no
extraterritorial
regulation
there,
that
would
be
just
fine.
so,
yes,
the
state
can,
through
internet,
so
to
speak,...
internet
monitoring,
through
virtual
monitoring...
do
all
the
work
it
needs
to
do
to
make
sure
that
the
out-of-state
winery
is
paying
taxes.
and,
by
the
way,
michigan
does
not
collect
taxes,
justice
kennedy,
through
the
distributors.
michigan
collects
taxes
from
the
wineries,
whether
they're
in-state
or
whether
they're
out-of-state
wine
shippers.
so
michigan
can
give
no
justification
for
why
out-of-state
wineries
have
to
go
through
the
distributors
for
tax
purposes.
they're
not
using
the
distributors
as
their
tax-collection
agents
now.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
kennedy,
reciprocity
laws...
yet...
possibly.
they
may
be
a
necessary
requirement
now
that
so
many
states
are
closed
to
states.
they
may
be
a
necessary
mechanism
for
some
states
trying
to
get
wines
to
market
in
the
way
that
the
framers
envisaged.
it
may
be
a
necessary,
for
now,
to
get
into
closed
states.
in
a
world
that
we
hope
that
you
create,
in
which
discrimination
is
not
allowed,
they
would
be
completely
unnecessary
and
possibly
unconstitutional.
but
to
return
to
the
key
point
here,
michigan
and
new
york
may
not
facially
discriminate
in
favor
of
their
own
producers
unless
they
can
show
that
reasonable
nondiscriminatory
alternatives
are
unavailable.
and
here,
justice
souter,
on
any
standard
of
heightened
scrutiny,
they
have
not
come
close
to
making
that
kind
of
showing,
because
there
are
all
these
other
means...
means
that
have
been
recognized
by
the
26
states
that
don't
discriminate,
means
that
have
been
proven
in
states
from
new
hampshire
to
virginia,
means
that
are
not
based
on
facial
discrimination.
it's
the
discrimination
that
has
to
be
shown
to--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--be
necessary
here.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
not...
they
are
subject
to
heightened
scrutiny
because
they
discriminate
against
out-of-staters
in
a
way
that
you
could
not...
for
example,
in
new
energy,
you
said
that
you
can't
have
a
preference
for...
you
can't
have
a
discrimination
in
ohio
in
reciprocity
for
indiana.
reciprocity
laws
normally
do
violate
the
principle
of
dormant
commerce
clause
invalidation.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
not...
we
contend
that
they
would
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny,
and
they
could
be
upheld
if
the
state
could
show
that
they
are
closely
tailored
in
a--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--way
that
these
laws
are
not.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
your
honor,
that's
not
before,
and
if
there
were
other
reasons--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--the
state
could--
[laughter]
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
nothing
in
this
decision
requires
you
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
there
are
other
state
defenses
in
other
cases.
the
justifications
the
states
have
given
here
are
so
terribly
weak
in
relation
to
their
discriminatory
laws
that
you
should
strike
down
these
laws,
you
should
invalidate
them,
you
should
affirm
the
judgement
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
reverse
the
judgements
of
the
second
circuit.
thank
you
very
much.
