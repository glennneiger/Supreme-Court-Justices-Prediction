justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
was
not
obvious
to
the
person
who
at
least
drafted
the
webb-kenyon
in
the
first
instance,
because
as
i...
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
an
anti-discrimination
provision,
and
that
was
then
dropped.
and
do
we
know
why
it
was
dropped?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
is
that
a...
is
that
on
a
legislative
history
record
somewhere?
do
we
know
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
do
you
make
of
the
argument
that
there's
no
practical
way,
except
at
great
expense,
to
audit
compliance
if
they're
out
of
state?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
will
grant
that's
required,
but
the
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
to
find
out
whether
they're
doing
what
they
are
required
to
do,
you've
got
to
drop
in
unexpectedly
and
make
an
audit.
and
that's
one
thing
in
the
state;
it's
another
thing
across
the
country.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--saying
they
are
not
dropping
in
to
local
wineries
to
do
audits,
in
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
we
have
in
the
record
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
we've
got
one
difference
from
bacchus,
because
the
claim
that's
being
made
here,
which
i
gather
was
not
made,
or
made
seriously,
in
bacchus,
is
there
really
is
a
need
for
differential
treatment
for
purposes
of
enforcement.
go
back
to
the
enforcement
of
the
tax
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
are
we
supposed...
what
standard
are
we
supposed
to
use
to
judge
that
argument?
and,
by
that
standard,
how
good
is
the
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
because--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
facial
discrimination.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
about
audits
for
revenue--
justice
david
h.
souter
--they...
you
say
they
don't
want
to
go
to
california
to
do
an
audit.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
we're
getting
ripped
off.
justice
david
h.
souter
could--
justice
david
h.
souter
--could
a
state--
justice
david
h.
souter
--could
a
state
require
an
out-of-state
winery
to
keep
its
books
online,
subject
to
a
password,
so
that,
with
a
password,
they
could
go
in
and
audit
the
books
across
the
country,
by
wire?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
your
opponents
have
said
that
there
isn't
any
clear
countervailing
interest
here.
they're
saying
you
can't
claim
you're
protecting
kids,
because
you're
selling
to
the
kids
at
home;
there's
no
serious
audit-collection
problem;
and
the
other
regulatory
interests...
they
didn't
say
this,
but
are,
sort
of,
gauzy
the
way
they're
stated.
i
mean,
they're
saying
that,
by
a
process
of
elimination,
what
you
get
down
to
is
nothing
but
discrimination
and
protectionism.
what
is...
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
where
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
substantial
interest?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
you...
i
mean,
you
say
that,
but
how?
the
very
activity
that
you
don't
want
them
to
engage
in,
you're
engaging
in,
or
your
local
wineries
are
engaging
in,
for
example.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
we
have
a
record
of
what
the
state
is
doing
with
respect
to
its
in-state
licensees,
indicating
what
it
could
not
do
effectively
to
out-of-staters?
what
do
we
have
in
the
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
should--
justice
david
h.
souter
--should
we
send
it
back
for...
if
we
disagree
with
the
rationale,
should
one
or
the
other
of
these
cases
go
back
for
evidence
on
what,
in
fact,
the
state
is
doing
in
relation
to
its
in-state
licensees
and
evidence
that
it
could
not
effectively
do
the
same
with
respect
to
out-of-staters?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
would
you
show?
what
do
you,
in
effect...
make
an
offer
of
proof.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
you...
if
you
did
that,
could
you
require,
as
i
suggested
of
counsel
on
the
other
side,
that
you...
that,
as
a
condition
of
the
licensing,
that
the
business
records
of
these
companies
be
placed
in
some
secure
online
fashion,
that,
with
a
password,
you
could
get
into
and
do
an
audit
across
the
continent
just
as
readily
as
you
could
do
an
audit
next
door?
could
michigan
not
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
it
doing
with
the
in-state
entities?
i
mean,
one
of
the
claims
is
that
nobody
is
posting
officers
outside
the
in-state
wineries,
no
one's
making
substantial
physical
audits
of
in-state
wineries.
is
that
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
they
inspect
them
for?
their
books,
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is
there
a
record
that
the
state
is
doing
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that
the
end
of
that
issue,
then?
i
mean,
it
is
your
burden,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
twenty-first
amendment
at
least
recognizes
that
alcohol
can
be
treated
as
unique,
and
the
issue
here
is
whether
you're
really
doing
that
in
a
way
that
supports
your
claim
of
interest.
justice
david
h.
souter
and,
so
far,
the
one
specific
thing
i've
heard
from
you
is
that
state
inspectors
do
go
on
winery
premises,
and
they
count
bottles,
and
they
see
if
they
match
what's
on
the
written
record.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
illegal...
i'm
sorry...
you've
got
to
be
specific.
what
illegal
activities?
selling
to
minors?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
if
licensed
premises
don't
serve
a
state
interest,
then
you
can't
require
a
licensed
premises,
so
that
argument
doesn't
get
too
far.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
seem
to
be
talking...
may
i
just
ask
one...
we
seem
to
be
talking
about
two
different
things.
justice
scalia
was
assuming
that,
if
you
have
the
license
and
some
in-state
warehouse,
you
can
ship
from
outside.
and
i...
is
that
the
assumption?
or
is
your
argument
that
new
york
can
require...
does
require
the
in-state
warehouse,
and
you
can
ship
into...
in
new
york,
you
can
ship
only
from
that
warehouse?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the...
we
don't
know
yet.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
your
argument
there
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
they
break
the
law,
you
can
shut
down
the
warehouse;
whereas,
you
can't
effectively
do
that
if
the
warehouse
is
in
california.
isn't
that
your
point?
