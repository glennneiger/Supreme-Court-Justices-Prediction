justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
your
view,
could
the
three-tier
system,
itself,
be
challenged
by
a
new
jersey
wholesaler
wanting
to
sell
in
new
york,
or
a
new
york
wholesaler
wanting
to
sell
in
new
jersey?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
under
your
view,
the
whole
three-tier
system
has
to
go
down?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
my
hypothetical.
i
don't
know
exactly
how...
the
way
it
works,
you
have
to
be
a
new
york
wholesaler
to
sell
to
a
new
york
retailer.
under
your
view,
a
new
jersey
wholesaler
could
sell
to
a
new
york
retailer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
so
far
as...
the
rationale
is
the
same.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that,
under
your
rationale,
that
that
in-state
licensing
system
has
to
fall
if
there's
a
new
jersey
wholesaler.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
only
temperance,
but
it's
control
over
revenues.
can
you
tell
me,
is
the...
is
there
a
new
york
state
excise
tax
on
alcohol?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
it
collected
by
the
wholesaler?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
what
is
it,
ten
dollars
a
gallon,
or
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
on
one--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
is
on
one--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--under
our
cases,
can
the
california
winery
be
required
to
remit
the
tax
to
the
new
york
state
revenue
authorities?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
consistent
with
quill?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
does
the
federal
authority
make
a
routine
audit
to
see
that
the
state
tax
has
been
paid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
very
narrow,
but
the
rationale
is
sweeping,
and
that's
why
i
asked.
i
just
don't
know
if
the
in-state
licensure
system,
which
is
the
cornerstone
of
the
three-tier
distribution
system,
can
survive
under
your
rationale,
assuming
the
hypothetical
where
a
new
jersey
wholesaler
has
all
of
the...
you
know,
the
physical
facilities
and
so
forth
that
the
new
york
wholesaler
does.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
know,
but
what--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
you're...
all
you're
asking
is
for
a
rationale
that's
sweeping.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
they
do
today,
i'm
sure,
but--
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ms.
sullivan--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--may
i...
may
i...
i
just
want
to
clarify
one
point.
it
was
just...
the
question
justice
stevens
asked.
it's
your
position
that
if
michigan
allows
michigan
wines
to
be
sold
and
possessed
and
consumed,
that
it
must
also
allow
out-of-state
wine
to
be
sold,
possessed,
and
consumed.
would--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
is
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--commerce
clause,
in
effect,
protects
consumers
in
states
from
entrenched
business
interests
that
want
to
have
protectionism,
and
you're...
you
object
to
that
and
invoke
the
commerce
clause
to
do
it.
under
that
rationale,
aren't
all
the
california
reciprocity
laws
invalid,
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
think
what's
fairly
implied
in
justice
o'connor's
question,
you
have
to
look
at
the
language
of
bacchus,
and
the
language
of
bacchus,
in
effect,
restored
the
anti-discrimination
component
of
the
commerce
clause
to
liquor
control.
i
think
that's
a
fair
and
necessary
reading
of
the
case.
now--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
know
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--involved
pineapple
wine
and
all
that.
i
know
that,
but--
[laughter]
--what
we're
talking
about
is
the
language
of
the
court
in
that
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you
have
to
understand
young
in
the
light
of
its
context,
where
there
was
no
discrimination--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
let
me
ask,
once
we
accept
the
proposition...
i
think
this
is
the
necessary
reading
of
bacchus...
that
the
commerce
clause
applies
to
liquor
and
prevents
discrimination,
it
seems
to
me
it's
just
like
any
other
commodity...
food,
milk,
et
cetera...
and,
in
this
case,
you
have
a
very
substantial
burden
to
show
that
this
discriminatory
treatment
is
justified...
maybe
strict
scrutiny,
maybe
heightened
scrutiny.
and
this
trial
has
occurred.
you
have
had
that
opportunity.
i
don't
see
why
you
have
a
right
to
go
back.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
michigan
can
prohibit
the
importation
of
any
wine,
but
still
allow
its
own
wine
to
be
produced,
sold,
and
consumed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
say
further
than
that;
you
say
the
purpose
was
to
allow
that
the
states
discriminate
in
favor
of
home
industry,
if
it
chooses.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we've
also
said
that
mere
protectionism
is
permitted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you...
do
you
take
the
position
that
your
colleague
on
your
same
side
takes,
that
a
state
can
permit
only
the
sale,
consumption,
and...
of
its
own
wines,
and
bar
all
out-of-state
wines?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just
for
local
protectionism.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
just
for
local
protectionism.
we
want
to
promote
our
wines,
and
not
anybody
else's.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
your--
--what
your
theory
is.
and
so
you
are
in
agreement
with
your
colleague
that
this
could
be
done,
if
new
york
chose.
you
can
only
drink
new-york-grown
wines
in...
sell
and
consume...
in
the
state
of
new
york.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
also
goes
to
the
very
core
of
the
commerce
clause.
and
there
are
really
two
classifications
of
dormant
commerce
clause
cases.
one
is...
and
i
think
it's
an
improper
use
of
the
term
"dormant
clause"...
is
where
there's
discrimination.
only
the
congress
can
allow
discrimination
against
out-of-state
products.
that's
one
whole
classification.
and
that's
what's...
and
that's
what's
involved
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
the
court
is
consolidated
granholm
versus
heald,
michigan
beer
and
wine
wholesalers
versus
heald,
and
swedenburg
versus
kelley.
these
are
consolidated
cases
which
challenge
laws
in
michigan
and
new
york.
it
simplifies
the
statement
somewhat
but
suffice
it
to
say
here
that
each
state,
michigan
and
new
york,
with
different
mechanisms
forbids
of
severely
restricts
the
sales
of
wine
by
out
of
state
wineries
directly
to
consumers.
the
states
however
do
allow
direct
sales
to
consumers
by
wineries
located
instate.
we
consolidated
the
cases.
we
granted
certiorari
on
the
following
questions:
does
a
state’s
regulatory
scheme
that
permits
instate
wineries
directly
to
ship
alcohol
to
consumers
but
restricts
the
ability
of
out-of-state
wineries
to
do
so
violate
the
dormant
commerce
clause
in
light
of
section
two
of
the
twenty-first
amendment?
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
invalidated
the
michigan
law.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
sustained
the
new
york
law.
the
first
part
of
our
analysis
is
whether
these
laws
do
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
contrary
to
the
mandated
commerce
clause.
the
second
part
of
the
analysis
is
whether
discriminatory
state
laws
are
permitted
nevertheless
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
we
have
little
trouble
concluding
that
the
laws
of
both
states
do
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
well-established
commerce
clause
principles.
time
and
again,
the
court
has
held
that
in
all
but
the
narrower
circumstances.
state
laws
violate
the
commerce
clause
if
they
mandate
differential
treatment
of
instate
and
out-of-state
economic
interests
and
if
that
discrimination
benefits
the
instate
interest
and
burdens
the
out-of-state
interest.
this
rule
is
essential
to
the
foundations
of
the
union.
the
mere
fact
of
non-residence
should
not
foreclose
a
producer
in
one
state
from
access
to
markets
in
other
states.
states
may
not
enact
laws
that
burden
out-of-state
producers
simply
to
give
a
competitive
advantage
to
instate
businesses.
the
opinion
of
the
court
explains
in
more
detail
how
the
michigan
and
the
new
york
regulatory
schemes
in
these
cases
do
discriminate
against
out-of-state
wine
producers.
the
state
contends
that
nevertheless,
their
statutes
are
saved
by
section
2
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
and
section
2
of
that
constitutional
provision
says
as
follows,
the
transportation
or
importation
into
any
state,
territory,
or
possession
of
the
united
states
for
delivery
or
use
therein
of
intoxicating
liquors
in
violation
of
the
laws
thereof
is
hereby
prohibited.
the
states’
position
that
this
provision
saves
their
laws
is,
we
hold,
inconsistent
with
our
precedent
and
with
the
history
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
the
aim
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
to
allow
states
to
maintain
an
effective
and
uniform
system
for
controlling
liquor
by
regulating
its
transportation,
importation,
and
use.
the
amendment
did
not
give
states
the
authority
to
pass
uniform
laws
in
order
to
discriminate
against
out-of-state
goods,
a
privilege
they
have
not
enjoyed
at
any
earlier
time.
the
court
has
held
that
state
regulation
of
alcohol
is
limited
by
the
non-discrimination
principle
of
the
commerce
clause.
when
a
state’s
statute
directly
regulates
or
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce
or
when
its
effect
is
to
favor
instate
economic
interest
over
out-of-state
interest,
we
have
generally
strucked
down
the
statute
without
further
inquiry.
the
court
decided
a
case
called
bacchus
imports
versus
dias,
and
that
provides
a
particularly
telling
example
of
this
proposition.
in
that
case,
what
was
at
issue
was
an
excise
tax
enacted
by
hawaii
that
exempted
certain
alcoholic
beverages
produced
in
that
state.
the
court
rejected
the
argument
that
hawaii’s
discrimination
against
out-of-state
liquor
was
authorized
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
despite
attempts
by
the
states
to
distinguish
it
in
the
instant
case,
bacchus
forecloses
any
contention
that
section
2
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
immunizes
discriminatory
direct
shipment
laws
from
commerce
clause
scrutiny.
now,
the
states
offered
two
primary
justifications
for
restricting
direct
shipments
from
out-of-state
wineries.
one
is
keeping
alcohol
out
of
the
hands
of
minors
and
another
is
facilitating
tax
collection.
the
states
provide
little
evidence
that
the
purchase
of
wine
over
the
internet
by
minors
is
a
problem.
without
concrete
evidence,
the
direct
shipping
of
wine
is
likely
to
increase
alcohol
consumption
by
minors.
we
are
left
with
the
states’
unsupported
assertions.
under
our
precedence
which
requires
the
clearest
showing
to
justify
discriminatory
state
regulation,
this
is
not
enough.
the
states’
tax
collection
justification
is
also
insufficient.
while
the
states’
concerns
are
not
wholly
illusory,
their
regulatory
objectives
can
be
achieved
without
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce.
out-of-state
licensees
could
be
required
to
submit
regular
sales
reports
and
to
remit
taxes.
indeed,
various
stages
use
this
approach
for
taxing
direct
interstate
wine
shipments
and
report
no
problems
with
tax
collection.
states
have
broad
power
to
regulate
liquor
under
section
2
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
this
power,
however,
does
not
allow
states
to
ban
or
severely
limit
the
direct
shipment
of
out-of-state
wine
while
simultaneously
authorizing
direct
shipment
by
instate
producers.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
stevens

dissenting
opinion
