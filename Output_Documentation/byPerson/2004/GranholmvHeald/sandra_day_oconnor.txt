now
the
bacchus
case
cuts
against
you,
to
some
extent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
don't
you
focus
on
that?
because
it's
a
little
hard
to
plan
on
overruling
that
case.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why
don't
you
at
least
address
how
you
would
distinguish
bacchus?
because
there
is
a
lot
of
language
in
there
that
cuts
against
your
position.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
wait
a
minute.
you...
it
was
suggested
that
the
state
could
require
a
license
of
an
out-of-state
supplier,
and
that
that
license
could
be
conditioned
upon
submission
to
michigan's
jurisdiction
in
all
respects.
is
that
not
feasible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
could
you
not
require
submission
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--michigan's
jurisdiction
for
all
purposes
of
enforcement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
gets
us
back
to
bacchus
and
what
to
make
of
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
dissent
seemed
to
think
so--
[laughter]
--didn't
it?
