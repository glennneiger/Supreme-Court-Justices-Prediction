we
will
now
hear
argument
in
granholm
against
heald
and
two
related
cases.
mr.
bolick.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
sullivan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
deny
that
a
state...
that
michigan
could
bar
all
out-of-state
wine...
not
just...
not
just
california,
but
they
could
bar
all
out-of-state
wines?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
reason
being
given
to
give
a
monopoly
to
local
producers,
that's
their--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whole
purpose.
but
could
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
saying
just
to
look
at
the...
just
limit
to
the
market
to...
the
only
market
participants
would
be
michigan
wine--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--wineries.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
craig
against
boren
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--had
nothing
to
do
with
the
commerce
clause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nothing
to
do
with
importation,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
congress--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--could
enact
a
statute
authorizing
the
states
to
do
just
what
they've
done
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--be
sure
i
heard
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
correctly.
you'd
concede
that
the
reciprocity
laws
are
all
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
contend
that
they
do...
the
liquor
reciprocity
laws,
all
of
them
are
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
can...
that
they
can
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--upheld
by
making
a
showing
that
you
say
is
virtually
impossible
to
make.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
think
it
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
is
an
interesting
question
as
to
whether
that's
a...
that's
a...
you
know,
that's
a
necessary
consequence
of
this
decision,
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms.
sullivan.
mr.
casey.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
question
was
before
the
court,
because
the
dissent
certainly
raised
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
halligan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
you
can't
grant
a
tax
exemption...
and
it
seems
to
me,
a
fortiori...
you
can't
grant
a
prohibition
about
importing
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
suggesting
a
tax
on
imports
is
less
restrictive
than
a
prohibition
on
imports.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms.
halligan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bolick,
you
have,
let's
see,
about
four
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they've
all
been
drinking--
[laughter]
--to
arbitrators.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--really
is
whether
the
plain
language
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
allows
that
very
protectionism.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
bolick.
the
case
is
submitted.
