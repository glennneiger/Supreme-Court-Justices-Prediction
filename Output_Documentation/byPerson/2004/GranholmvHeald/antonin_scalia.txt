justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
"it's
primarily
a
federal
activity",
that
the
federal
government
polices
compliance
with
the
state
tax
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
that
occur?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no...
i
mean,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
rather
lengthy
statement
you
made
earlier,
that
the
bacchus
case
didn't
involve
the
importation
of
alcohol.
but
it
did.
i
mean,
the
only
reason
that
the
in-state
exemption
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional
was
because
you
were
treating
out-of-state
sellers
differently.
how
can
you
possibly
say
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
case
didn't
involve
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
see,
i
don't...
i
don't
understand.
didn't
you
have
an
opportunity
to
develop
the
record?
i
mean,
this
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
discriminatory
matter.
it
was
your
burden
to
show
that
whatever
discrimination
existed...
assuming
that
we
find
the
law
the
way
bacchus
seemed
to
say
it
is...
it
was
your
burden
to
show
that
there
was
some
justification
for
that
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
had
your
chance
to
show
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--tell
us
what
those...
what
that
material
is,
and
if
we
find
that
material
sustains
your
burden,
that's
fine,
you
win;
and
if
it
doesn't,
you
lose.
i
don't
know
why
we
have
to
let
you
go
back
and--
[laughter]
--and
retry
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i'm
interested
in.
you
win,
either
way.
if
it...
maybe
if
the
commerce
clause...
dormant
commerce
clause
discrimination
principle
applies,
you
win,
if
we
scrutinize
strictly
and
say
you
have
a
good
justification.
whether
you
do
or
not,
i
guess
i'll
find
out
from
reading
the
record,
but
i'm
more
interested
in
the
first
half,
which
is...
doesn't
apply
at
all.
now,
your
opponent
said,
in
response
to
my
pointing
to
brandeis
on
this,
that
to
support
you,
as
to
precedent,
bacchus.
young's
market
isn't
any
good
anymore.
as
to
concept,
you
can
divide
the
dormant
commerce
clause
into
a...
you
have
to
favor
out-of-state
principle,
which
was
the
original
package
doctrine,
which
has
long
since
disappeared,
and
the
anti-discrimination
principle,
which
hasn't
disappeared.
and
her
third
part,
implicit,
is,
historically,
this
whole
section
2
was
aimed
at
the
original
package
part;
there
is
not
a
word
in
any
brief
i
saw
that
suggests
any
motive
in
section
2
to
get
rid
of
the
anti-discrimination
principle.
i
haven't
found
a
word
in
support
on
your
side
on
that.
so
she
says,
"put
those
three
things
together,
and
we
win.
"
that's
her
point.
now,
what's
your
response?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
put
in
the
qualifications.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
that
be?
i
mean,
if
this
is
a
constitutional
elimination
of
the
commerce
clause,
how
can
congress
bring
it
back
in
simply
by
enacting
a
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you...
you
want
us
to
read
it
by
its
terms.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
if
we
read
it
absolutely
the
way
one
of
your
arguments
wants
us
to
do,
surely
it
excludes
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't
want
us
to
read
it
absolutely.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
fine.
and
the
other
side
isn't
denying
that
here,
that
if,
you
know,
they're...
discrimination
means
treating
out-of-state
people
differently
without
good
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
you're
willing
to...
okay,
if
you're
willing
to
acknowledge
that,
then
we're
halfway
there
and
we're
just
arguing
about
whether
there
is
good
reason
here
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does...
how
does
requiring
them
to
have
an
in-state
office
somehow
prevent
them
from
shipping
to
minors
from
out
of
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
from
shipping
to
consumers
from
out
of
state
without
paying
you
their
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
the
opening
of
an--
justice
antonin
scalia
--an
office
in
new
york
state
at
all
prevent
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can't
prevent
it
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
even
if...
i'm
willing
to
assume
that.
how
does
that
guarantee
that
the
out-of-state
winery
will
not,
in
violation
of
new
york
state
law,
ship
directly
to
minors
or
ship
directly
to
consumers,
just
simply
bypassing
its
cache
of
wine
in
new
york?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
guarantee.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
enable
you
to
enforce
your
law
any
more
rigorously
than
without
having
a
requirement
for
a
local
office.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
states
that
do
a
allow
shipment
from
out
of
state?
they
don't
care
about
their--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
many
are
there
that
allow
shipment
from
out-of-state
wineries?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
certainly
suggests
that
what...
that
what
you're
arguing
is
not
essential
to
the
state's
enforcement
of
its
alcohol
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
states
don't
like
federal
regulation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
any
sort,
of
course.
i
know
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
sure.
when
you
have
facial
discrimination
against
out-of-state
products,
i
think
you're...
the
bar
is
a
little
higher
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
who's
going
to
count
the
bottles?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
they
were
referring
to
full
bottles.
i
guess--
[laughter]
