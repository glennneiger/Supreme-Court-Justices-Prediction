justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
when
you
say
there
is
no
precedent...
i
mean,
i
think
a
much
more
modest
claim
than
you're
making,
the
claim
simply
that
a
state
cannot
discriminate
against
out-of-state
liquor...
i.e.,
the
physical
liquid...
which
is
really
more
modest
and
keeps
the
three-tier
effect...
now,
your...
that
claim,
that
they
couldn't
do
that,
was
really
what
was
advanced
in
young's
market.
i
read
the
briefs
in
that
case.
the
briefs
presented
that
court...
you
could
have
written
those
briefs.
and
the
difficulty
for
you
is,
it
articulated
that
more
modest
version
very
clearly,
made
a
tremendously
strong
case,
that
was
not
forbidden
by
section
2
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
and
this
court
squarely
rejected
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
result,
i
understand,
you
could
put
on
the
basis
of
there
being
no
discrimination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
reading
justice
brandeis'
opinion,
i
can't
believe
that
that
was
the
basis
for
his
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
trying
to
think
of
what
brandeis
could
have
been
thinking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
right.
and
this
is
a
reconstruction,
because
i
have
no
doubt,
and
you
have
no
doubt,
that
section
2
was
meant
to
end
that
part
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause
that
would
come
under
the
name
of
original
package
doctrine--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
meant
that
the
foreign
liquor
has
to
be
treated
better
than
domestic
liquor.
now,
he's
thinking,
"why
is
that?
"
"what
is
that
package
doctrine?
"
and
the
answer
is,
the
dormant
commerce
clause...
it's
part
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause...
the
dormant
commerce
clause
is
the
implication
from
the
existence
of
the
commerce
power
in
the
constitution.
so
if
we
have
an
amendment
that
says
"that
aspect
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause
doesn't
apply.
"
that
means
the
dormant
commerce
clause
doesn't
apply,
because
you
can't
divide
the
dormant
commerce
clause
into
six
different
parts,
or
even
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
maybe...
i
think
that's
how
he's
reasoning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
he
is,
and
even
if
he
isn't,
why
isn't
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
do.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
do,
but
the
principle
of
webb-kenyon,
which
was
enacted
when
the
wilson
act
was
already
there...
very
clear...
is
to
stop
the
original
package
doctrine,
stop
favoritism
of
the
out-of-state
liquor
shipment,
which
meant,
in
a
dry
state,
you
had
to
sell
less.
i
mean,
that's
what
it's
there
for.
i
didn't
find
a
word,
in
other
words,
contrary
to
what
i've
just
said;
and
if
there
are
such
words,
now
is
the
time
to
point
them
to
me...
to
point
them
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
could
congress
pass
a
law
forbidding
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
all
right.
but
i
need
an
answer
to
it.
[laughter]
because,
you
see,
what's
going
to
come
next
is,
if
you
say
yes,
i'm
going
to
say,
"well,
didn't
it
pass
that
law
with
the
wilson
act?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
did--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
count
bottles?
i
would
have
thought
the
consumers
have
all
the
bottles.
[laughter]
