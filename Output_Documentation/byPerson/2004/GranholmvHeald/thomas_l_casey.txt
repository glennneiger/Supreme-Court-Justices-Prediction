mr.
thomas
l.
casey
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
more
than
70
years,
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
permitted
states
to
restrict
the
importation
and
delivery
of
alcohol
by
out-of-state
vendors.
there
are
substantial
differences
between
licensed
in-state
vendors
of
alcohol
and
out-of-state
vendors
that
are
not
subject
to
the
full
extent
of
state
regulatory
and
taxing
powers.
because
of
those
differences,
michigan
requires
that
sales,
including
direct
shipment
of
alcohol,
be
performed
only
by
licensed,
strictly
regulated,
in-state
vendors.
this
importation
regulation
is
a
power
expressly
conferred
by
the
text
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
it's
consistent
with
the
entire
history
of
alcohol
regulation
in
this
country,
and
it's
consistent
with
this
court's
jurisprudence
interpreting
the
twenty-first
amendment--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
bacchus
case
was
a
very
unique
situation
that
we
believe
is
not
in
any
way
controlling
in
the
present
case.
it
was
not
an
importation
case;
it
was
an
exemption
from
a
state
excise
tax
on
wholesalers
for
alcohol
that
was
already
within
the
state's
stream
of
commerce.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
disagree
that
that
is
a
necessary
reading--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--of
the
case.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct,
but
you're...
you
have
to
understand
that
language
in
light
of
the
actual
context.
there,
the
state
did
not
even
assert
a
twenty-first
amendment
defense.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
was
discrimination
in
young,
your
honor,
and
i'd
like
to
get
to
that.
but
to
focus
on
bacchus
for
a
moment,
the
state
never
asserted
the
twenty-first
amendment,
and
it
was
undisputed--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--correct.
and
we
have
suggested,
in
our
brief,
that
the
bacchus
case
is
distinguishable
and
not
controlling
here.
we
have
also
suggested
that
bacchus
was
incorrectly
decided.
we
can
prevail
in
this
case
without
overruling
bacchus,
but
we
have
suggested
that--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--well--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
only
justification
for
the
statute
in
bacchus
was
what
the
court
characterized
as
"mere
protectionism".
that's
not
the
situation
with
the
michigan
statute.
again,
the
michigan
statute
involves
the
paradigm...
or
the
quintessential
twenty-first
amendment
power
of
regulating
importation;
it's
not
an...
attacks
on
alcohol
that's
already
an
exemption
from
a
tax
for
two
particular
products.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
do
you--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--it
was
treating--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--it
was
treating
two
particular
items
of
in-state
production
differently
than
all
other
in-state
items
and
out-of-state
items;
but
it
was
a
taxation
issue,
not
an
importation
issue.
and
as
the
court
said
in
bacchus
and
in
capital
cities,
the
correct
analysis
in
the...
in
evaluating
this
kind
of
case
is
to
determine,
first,
whether
the
activity
of
the
regulation
at
issue
is
an
exercise
of
a
power
conferred
by
the
twenty-first
amendment--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that
was
the
first
stage
of
the
court's
analysis.
the
court
went
on
to
say
it
was
not
supported
by
any
clear
concern
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
combating
the
evils
of
an
unrestricted
traffic
in
liquor--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--we--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--we
disagree
wholeheartedly
with
that.
the
michigan--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
michigan
regulations
do
promote
the
state's
interest
in
temperance.
they
do
give
the
state
a
better--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--but
the
key
is,
with
an
in-state
licensee,
the
state
has
the
ability
to
enforce
against
that
licensee,
to
inspect,
to
punish
the
licensee--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--to
hold
them
accountable.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
record
in
this
case
consisted
of
a
small
number
of
affidavits,
answers
to
interrogatories,
some
surveys
that
were
submitted
as
exhibits
to
motions
for
summary
judgement.
both
sides
submitted
that
type
of
evidence.
the
district
court
decided
this
was
a
question
of
law,
and
specifically
said
that
he
did
not
consider
any
of
the
factual
evidence.
so
the
record--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--was
not
fully
developed.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes,
if--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--we
would
show
that
the
michigan
requirement
limiting
sales
and
direct
shipping
to
in-state
licensees
is
required
because
the
state
only
has
effective
enforcement
authority
over
in-state
licensees.
but--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--michigan
does
have
a
current
license
for
out-state
seller
of
wine.
you
know,
these
players--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--we--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--certainly,
we
could
pass
a
law
to
that
effect.
the
problem
is--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--but
there
is
no
guarantee
that
such
an
audit
would
be
just
the
same
as
an
audit
of
an
in-state--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--despite
the
lack
of
evidence
in
the
record
and
the
fact
that
district
court
did
not
consider
that
evidence,
the
sixth
circuit
dismissed
all
of
those
claims
of
the
state
and
remanded
for
entry
of
judgement
on
the
plaintiffs
without
giving
us
an
opportunity
to
develop
that
record.
i
also
want
to
say--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--there
was--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--there--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--there
was
evidence
in
the
record.
there
were
affidavits
from
michigan
enforcement
officials
about
stings,
about
problem
with
enforcing--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--against
internet--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--our
key
position
is
that
before
you
get
to
that
kind
of
evidentiary
burden,
the
legal
question--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--we
disagree
with
that
entire
position.
the
text--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
text
of
the
twenty-first
amendment...
the
text
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
gives
states
the
right
to
control
imports.
the
history
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
the
webb-kenyon
act
clearly
demonstrate...
the
purpose
of
the
webb-kenyon
act
was
to
eliminate
alcohol
shipments
from--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
commerce
clause.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
that's
precisely
what
the
situation
was
with--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
title
of
the
webb-kenyon
act
is,
"it
is
in...
an
act
divesting
intoxicating
liquors
of
their
interstate
character
in
certain
cases.
"
"the
clear
intent
of
the
webb-kenyon
act
was
to
remove
alcohol
from
the
commerce
clause.
"
"the
constitution...
the
twenty-first
amendment
constitutionalized
that
commerce
clause
framework.
"
that's
what
this
court
said
in
craig
v.
boren.
craig
v.
boren
also
said,
"the
twenty-first
amendment
creates
an
exception
to
the
operation
of...
the
normal
operation
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
"
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that
may
be.
the
commerce
clause
remains
alive
and
well,
but
the
commerce
clause--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--in
the
context
of
powers
expressly
conferred
upon
the
states
by
the
twenty-first
amendment,
that's
an
exception
to
the
operation...
the
normal
operation
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
commerce
clause
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
just
as
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
commerce
clause
and
other
provisions
of
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
when
you
read
the
two
in
light
of
each
other,
the
purposes
of
each,
it
is
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
to
remove
alcohol
from
interstate
commerce
as
a
constitutional
matter,
to
prevent
congress
from
tampering
with
it
in
the
future,
to
give
the
judgement
to
the
states
as
to--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
necessity
for--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that
is
one
of
the
purposes,
yes.
in
that...
in
the
case
that
was
decided
immediately
after
the
young's
market,
mahoney,
and
indianapolis
brewing,
the
court
said,
"discrimination
is
permissible
in
this
narrow
context,
where
the
state
is
acting
pursuant
to
its
twenty-first
amendment
powers
and
regulating
importation
of
alcohol.
"
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i...
as
i
indicated,
i
don't
believe
bacchus
overrules
those
cases;
it
didn't
even
cite
most
of
those
cases.
but--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
correct.
but,
as
i
said,
we
believe
bacchus
is
distinguishable,
because
that
was
mere
protectionism,
the
state
does
have
other
justifications
here--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--mere
protectionism
is
permitted.
in
this
case,
if
we
have
to
present
other
justifications,
we
have,
and
there
are
other
justifications,
unlike
the
situation
in
bacchus.
so
even
if
the
bacchus
rationale
is
good
law,
we
still
prevail
on
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
