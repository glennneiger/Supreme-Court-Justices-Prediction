mr.
clint
bolick
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
124
years,
as
state
power
over
alcohol
has
ebbed
and
flowed,
one
principle
has
remained
virtually
constant,
that
states
may
regulate
alcohol
by
one
set
of
rules,
not
by
two.
new
york
and
michigan
consigned
out-of-state
wine,
and
only
out-of-state
wine,
to
the
three-tier
system
for
closing
the
market
to
thousands
of
small
family-run
wineries
and
their
customers
for
the
benefit
of
a
liquor
distributor
oligopoly.
discrimination
is
the
core
concern
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
it
sends
a
powerful
signal
that
the
state
is
engaged,
not
in
legitimate
regulation,
but
in
economic
protectionism.
the
states
and
the
liquor
distributors
make
a
sweeping
argument
that
this
court
has
consistently
rejected,
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
creates
plenary
state
authority.
mr.
clint
bolick
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
clint
bolick
no,
justice
kennedy.
so
long
as
the
state
does
not
discriminate
against
out-of-state
entities,
it
is
free
to,
as
this
court--
mr.
clint
bolick
--that
is...
or
a
challenge,
as
you
ask
the
question,
justice
kennedy,
could
be
mounted
to
that,
under
the
same
theory
that
we're
advocating
here.
the
state
may
have
a
different
set
of
defenses
that
it
doesn't
have
here.
but--
mr.
clint
bolick
--the--
mr.
clint
bolick
--it
has
to
pass
constitutional
muster.
mr.
clint
bolick
your
honor,
young's
market...
the
result
in
young's
market
was
correct--
mr.
clint
bolick
--exactly.
mr.
clint
bolick
the...
the
cases
that
followed
young's
market
and
purported
to
apply
its
reasoning
took
a
very
sweeping
view
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
the
court
began
trenching
on
that
very
broad
view
immediately
in
1939.
mr.
clint
bolick
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
the...
there
was
no
need
for
the
webb-kenyon
act
to
repeat
the
language
of
the
wilson
act.
the
wilson
act
dealt
with
the
question
of
discrimination.
the
webb-kenyon
act
dealt
with
questions
that
arose
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
the
wilson
act.
and
as
this
court
has
held
in
craig
versus--
mr.
clint
bolick
--i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
because
it
was
so
obvious
that
the
state
could
not,
prior
to
prohibition,
discriminate.
it
was
not
only
embodied
in
the
wilson
act,
but
it
was
embodied
in
at
least
three
cases
of
this
court.
mr.
clint
bolick
it
was
dropped
essentially
because
it
was
redundant.
mr.
clint
bolick
no,
justice
souter,
that
is
not
expressly
on
the
record.
what
is
on
the
record,
however,
is
that
the
court
was
aiming...
or,
excuse
me,
the
congress
was
aiming
at
specific
supreme
court
decisions.
there...
and
it...
and
the
one
case
that
was
clearest
on
point
on
discrimination
was
scott
versus
donald,
applying
both
the
commerce
clause
and
the
wilson
act
to
forbid
discrimination.
and
there
was...
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
overturn
that
decision.
and
as
this
court
has
held
in
craig
versus
boren,
and
elsewhere,
by
enacting
the
twenty-first
amendment,
congress
clearly
intended
to
incorporate
both
the
wilson
act
and
the
webb-kenyon
act
and
to
restore
to
the
states
the
police
power
that
they
had
before
prohibition.
emphatically,
discrimination
was
not
a
part
of
that
police
power.
it
was
a
very
accepted
context.
so,
too,
is
it
today.
when
the...
when
the
liquor
distributors
in
the
states
asked
this
court
to
overturn
the
bacchus
decision
and
to
adopt
a
plenary
view
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
it
is
not
just
asking
you
to
overturn
the
bacchus
decision;
it
is
asking
you
to
overturn
cases
starting
with
the
midcal
decision
in
1980,
the
more
recent
healy
decision,
and
others,
that
have
held
that
the
core
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause
and
the
twenty-first
amendment
must
be
harmonized,
that
the
commerce
clause
was
never
intended
to
be
obliterated.
and
when
you
look
at
the
core
values
of
the
two
clauses,
they
do
not
clash.
the
core
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause
is
nondiscrimination.
the
core
purpose
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
temperance.
and
if
you
have
a
discriminatory
statute,
it
sends
a
very
strong
signal
that,
in
fact--
mr.
clint
bolick
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clint
bolick
yes,
it
is.
mr.
clint
bolick
it's...
it
turns
out
to--
mr.
clint
bolick
--a
few
cents
a
bottle,
yes.
mr.
clint
bolick
it's
on...
it's...
and
all
alcohol.
mr.
clint
bolick
we
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
clint
bolick
it
is
consistent
with
quill.
the
way
that
the
states...
there
are
26
states
that
allow
direct
interstate
shipment
of
wine,
and
the
ftc
has
examined
their
record
to
see
if
they
are
doing
okay.
and
one
of
the
things
that
they
do...
are
able
to
do
is
tax
collection.
new
hampshire,
louisiana,
and
nevada
do
collect
taxes.
the
way
they
do
it
is
by
requiring
a
permit
in
order
to
ship
wine
into
the
state.
that
takes
care
of
a
number
of
problems,
including
all
sorts
of
accountability
concerns
that
the
state
may
raise.
mr.
clint
bolick
under--
mr.
clint
bolick
--justice
souter,
this
is
one
of
the
most
regulated
industries
in
america,
of
course,
and
the
model
legislation
that
has
been
adopted
by
a
number
of
states
includes
record-keeping
provisions,
it
requires
that
wineries--
mr.
clint
bolick
--no,
it's
important
to
recognize,
justice
souter,
that
under
the
three-tier
system,
which
is...
which
is
where
the
states
of
new
york
and
michigan
are
saying
that
the
other
state
wineries
have
to
go...
the
three-tier
system
does
not
do
that.
the
states
already
rely
on
the
federal
government
and
the
other
states
to
police
the
wineries.
mr.
clint
bolick
should
they--
mr.
clint
bolick
--they
may,
in
some
instances.
it
is
primarily
a
federal...
a
federal
activity.
mr.
clint
bolick
there
is
not...
there
is
not
a
great
deal
on
the
record,
either
way,
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
clint
bolick
that's
correct,
your
honor.
under
the--
mr.
clint
bolick
--under
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act,
any
violation
of
a
state
law
is
a
federal
offense
and
it
is
a
violation...
so
basically,
whether
it's
under-age
access,
whether
it's
taxation,
whatever--
mr.
clint
bolick
--basically,
every
single
time
that
there
is
a
transaction,
it
is
recorded
by
the
u.s.
trade
and
tax
bureau.
and
if
it
may
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time--
--for
rebuttal.
mr.
clint
bolick
justice
ginsburg,
very
important
question.
we
are
here
today
because
a
majority
of
states
have
chosen
to
regulate
wine
distinctively.
and
a
handful
of
them,
including
michigan
and
new
york,
have
chosen
to
do
so
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
so
long
as
states
do
not
discriminate,
in
terms
of
direct
shipping
with
regard
to
other
alcohol...
and
they
don't;
there's
a
flat
prohibition
across
the
united
states,
in
terms
of
beer
and
other
types
of
spirits...
we
will
not
be
here,
because
there
would
be
no
discrimination;
there
would
be
a
single
rule,
and
that
rule
would
be,
no
one
gets
to
do
it.
mr.
clint
bolick
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
three
very
brief
points.
there
his
a
panoply
of
tools
available
to
states
to
police
out-of-state
wineries
in
direct
shipping,
as
the
federal
trade
commission
has
recognized.
they
can,
if
they
issue
a
permit,
revoke
that
permit.
and
new
york
has
authority
to
issue
such
permits
under
section
105-9.
the
twenty-first
amendment
enforcement
act,
for
which
the
liquor
distributors
and
states
lobbied
very
hard,
gives
injunction
authority
in
the
home
federal
courts.
and,
of
course,
the
federal
agency,
the
tax
and
trade
bureau,
can
revoke
a
permit
if
state
law
is
violated.
in
the--
mr.
clint
bolick
--your
honor,
the
state...
the
federal
government
is
able
to
count
those,
but
the
evidence
is
that
they
don't.
and
that
goes
back
to
a
question,
i
believe,
justice
souter
asked.
in
the
michigan
case,
a
question
was
posed
in
an
interrogatory,
"what
enforcement
by...
is
done
of
in-state
wineries.
"
in
that
regard,
the
answer
was,
"none".
mr.
clint
bolick
that's
exactly
right.
and,
certainly
in
the
directly
shipping
context
in-state,
that
is
emphatically
the
case.
mr.
clint
bolick
with
direct
shipping--
mr.
clint
bolick
--with
direct
shipping,
justice
scalia,
we
can
personalize
things.
in
terms
of
the
bacchus
case,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
new
york,
like
hawaii,
conceded
protectionism.
it
is
very
rife
in
the
legislative
record
in
1970,
when
the
direct
shipping
was
extinguished.
in
1995,
when
governor
pataki
vetoed
a
bill
that
would
have
solved
this
problem,
he
said,
and
i
quote...
and
this
is
in
the
record,
the
joint...
the
second
circuit
joint
appendix,
at
442...
he
said,
and
i
quote,
"since
the
vast
majority
of
this
country's
wines
are
produced
in
california,
i
believe
that
this
bill
would
inevitably
lead
to
a
significant
increase
in
mail-order
wines
from
that
state
into
new
york.
"
"this
increase
could,
in
turn,
lead
to
a
decrease
in
sales
for
new
york
liquor
stores
and
their
distributors,
and
shrink
new
york
wineries'
market
share.
"
"that
is
protectionism.
"
and,
finally,
the
notion
that
small
winemakers
could
go
to
all
50
states
and
open
offices
in
order
to
do
this...
if
you
could
drive
out
to
middleburg
and
visit
juanita
swedenburg's
winery...
and
she
invites
you
to
do
so--
[laughter]
--you
will
find
mrs.
swedenburg
selling
wine,
harvesting
grapes,
and
bottling.
this
is
a
ban
on...
this
is
market
foreclosure,
sure
and
simple...
fewer
than
600
wineries
are
represented
on
the
stores
of
new
york's
shelves,
out
of
over
3,000
wineries--
mr.
clint
bolick
--in
the
united
states.
mr.
clint
bolick
and
i
would
refer
you,
in
my
brief
time
remaining,
to
the
brief,
the
carter-phillips
brief
for
the
napa
valley
vintners
association,
the
dkt
liberty
brief,
which
go
into
the
history
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
which
was
intended
to
restore
the
police
power,
which
did
not
include
the
power
to
discriminate.
our
clients
cannot
compete
with
the
liquor
distributors
in
the
political
marketplace
in
their...
in
their...
in
their
home
states.
they
can,
however,
compete
in
the
economic
marketplace.
the
commerce
clause
protects
that
right,
that
level
playing
field.
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
never
intended
to
take
it
away.
we
ask
this
court,
respectfully,
to
honor
124
years
of
precedent
in
the
national
economic
union.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
