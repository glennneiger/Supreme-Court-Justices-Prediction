justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
wasn't
that
broad
view
appropriate,
given
the
difference
between
the
language
of
the
wilson
act,
which
has
had
the
words
"to
the
same
extent
and
in
the
same
manner.
"
and
the
webb-kenyon
act,
which
became
the
second
section
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
leaves
out
"to
the
same
extent
and
the
same
manner.
"
it
just
says
that
"alcoholic
beverage
so
that
the
state
can
bar
importation
for
delivery
of,
or
use
therein,
in
violation
of
laws
thereof.
"
it
doesn't
say
"nondiscriminatory
laws".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
that's
the
act,
but
when
they
put
it
in
the
constitution,
why
didn't
they
adopt
the
language,
"to
the
same
extent
and
in
the
same
manner?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
have
just
one
further
question.
justice
kennedy
asked
you,
"what
about
the
wholesaler?
"
"what
about
the
retailer?
"
what
about
alcoholic
beverages
other
than
wine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
i
glean
from
what
you
said,
that
if
new
york
took
away
the
direct-sale
privilege
that
in-state
wineries
get,
then
out-of-state
wineries
wouldn't
be
any
better
off,
but
they'd
have
nothing
to
complain
about.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
a
decision
for
the
state
to
make.
i
mean,
the...
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
for
this
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
don't
we
focus
on
the
court's
rationale,
which
was
stated
very
concisely
by
justice
white.
he
said,
"hawaii's
discriminatory
tax
cannot
stand".
and
then
he
said,
"whatever
you
can
say
about
the
twenty-first
amendment,
one
thing
is
certain,
the
central
purpose
was
not
to
empower
the
states
to
favor
local
liquor
industries
by
erecting
barriers
to
competition.
"
that
was
this
court's
explanation
for
ruling
the
way
it
did,
even
though
there
was
this
infant
industry
of
pineapple
whatever.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
you
are
asking
us,
i
guess,
not
only
to
reject
bacchus,
but
who
was
the
first
one
that
said
that
the
commerce
clause
remains
alive
and
well?
was
it
justice
stewart?
and
i
forgot
which
case
it
was.
it
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
context
of
alcoholic
beverages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
a
different
argument
than
the
one
you
made
before,
which
seems
to
be
saying
the
twenty-first
amendment
trumps,
not
that
the
two
have
to
be
harmonized.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
that's
really
what
new
york's
concern
is,
then
why
does
new
york
say,
"ah,
but
out-of-staters,
if
only
you
establish
an
office
here...
not
a
winery;
an
office...
you
can
operate,
and
you
can
make
the
direct
sales
from
that
office,
and
even
in.
"
--i
think
your
brief
told
us
that,
well,
these
small
wineries,
out-of-state
wineries,
haven't
got
all
that
much
to
worry
about,
because,
after
all,
they
could
join
together...
a
group
of
them
could
open
an
office.
now,
that
office,
owned
by
a
group
of
out-of-state
vintners
is
not
going
to
have
bottles
on
the
shelf,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
do
you
envision
this
combination
of
small
wineries?
you
said
that
in-state
establishments
might
be
jointly
maintained
by
out-of-state
wineries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
to
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
what
extent
does
new
york
take
account
of,
say,
the
rigorous
regulation
in
the
states
from
which
this
wine
is
coming?
you
say
we
must
do
this
to
police
for
all
kinds
of
things.
but
don't
other
states...
california,
virginia...
don't
they
have
laws
that
their
local
wineries
must
meet?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is
new
york
just
saying,
"we're
going
to
treat
this
thing
as
though
it's
totally
unregulated,
anyway?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
according
to
the
district
court,
in
this
very
case,
the
state
attorney
general
conceded
that
new
york's
measure
allowing
direct
sales
by
in-state
wineries
was
designed
to
benefit
local
farmers.
