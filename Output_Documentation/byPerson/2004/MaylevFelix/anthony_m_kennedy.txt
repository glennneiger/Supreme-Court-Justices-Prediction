justice
anthony
m.

well,
of
course,
i
take
it
the
issue
doesn't
even
arise
unless
the
amendment
is
accepted
under
15(a).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
there's
been
lack
of
diligence,
et
cetera,
and...
or
some
prejudice
to
the
state
in
the
delay
of
the
amendment,
the
court
just
won't
accept
the
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
long
does
it
usually
take
to
file
a
responsive
pleading?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
before
we
leave
15(a),
let's
assume
that
we
do
not
accept
your
position
in
this
case
and
there's
potential
for
a
gaping
hole
in
aedpa.
does
the
state
have
some
ability
to
protect
itself
by
filing
a
responsive
pleading
and
cutting
off
the
amendment,
or
must
it
do
so
only
as
it
is
ordered
by
the
court
to
file
a
response?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
see
what
i'm
asking--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
successive
petition
rules,
or
the
rules
prohibiting
successive
petition,
seem
to
treat
the
entire
attack
as
one...
as
one
legal
theory,
as
one
case.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
in...
somewhat
intentioned
for
that,
for
you
to
break
it
down
the
way
you
want
to
under
rule
15(c).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a...
it's
a
little
odd
for
the
statute
to
say
that
the
rules
apply;
and
then
we
look
to
the
rules,
but
we
interpret
it
differently.
i
certainly
see
the
common
sense
of
your
position,
but
i'm
just
having
a
problem
with
15(c)(2).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
sue
for
negligence
or,
in
any
civil
action
we
might...
we
might
imagine,
there
might
be
three
or
four
ways
in
which
the
defendant
has
injured
me,
and
the
tiller
case,
the
railroad
case,
tells
us
that
it's
a
single
action.
and
do
you
concede
this,
that
you're
asking
us
to
interpret
this
differently
and
more
narrowly
than
in
the
civil
context?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
do
you
concede
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
hard
for
me
to
figure
it
out,
too,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
we
have
a
different
rule,
because
this
is
habeas.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
to
complete
justice
o'connor's...
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
you
say,
"and
we
interpret
this
differently
in
habeas
than
in
other
cases,
because
of
finality
concerns.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
interpret
it
differently.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
sure
it
would
be
acceptable,
but
what's
the
authority
for
interpreting
the
rule
two
different
ways,
depending
on
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let's
take--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me...
let
me
ask
you.
take
the
two
events
in
this
case,
and
as
explained
by
justice
breyer,
a
miranda
violation
in
the
questioning
and
then
a
problem
with
the
confrontation
clause
in
the
trial,
two
years
later.
let's
assume
that
there
was
a
1983
civil
action
for
those
violations,
and
let's
assume
that
both
are
actionable.
different
cause
of
action.
is
that...
how
would...
how
would
an
amendment
be
treated
in
a
civil
action?
based
on
most
of
the
lower-court
precedents
you've
been...
would
the
amendment
related
back?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
would
think
no
relation
back,
in
the
case
i
put--
