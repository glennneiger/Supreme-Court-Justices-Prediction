no,
please,
go
ahead.
justice

mr.
chan,
there
is
really
no
way
for
the
state
entirely
to
protect
itself
by...
even
by
filing
an
answer
immediately.
that
would
protect
it
against
the
automatic
acceptance
of
an
amendment,
but
it
wouldn't
protect
it
against
the
district
judge's
ability
to
grant
an
amendment
after
the
response.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
way
to
get
any
protection
against
that,
no
matter
how
promptly
you
respond.
justice
antonin
scalia
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
have
more
than
rule
11;
you
have
section
2244,
which
says
that
an
application
for
habeas
corpus,
quote,
"may
be
amended
as
provided
in
the
rules
of
procedure
applicable
to
civil
actions.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
i
don't
think
it's
even
a
close
question
whether
the
rules
of
procedure
for
amendment
in
civil
actions
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
was...
that
was
a
rule
for
tort
cases;
it
wasn't
a
rule
for
habeas
cases.
and,
as
pointed
out
by
the
government,
habeas
cases
are
fundamentally
different,
in
that
the
notice
that
you
give
to
the
opposing
party
in
tort
cases,
ordinary
civil
cases,
is
very
vague.
it's
just,
you
know,
what
the
event
was,
"i
got
hit
by
a
train.
"
you
don't
have
to
say,
"wherein,
the
train
was
negligent...
or
the
railroad
was
negligent.
"
or
anything
else;
just,
whereas,
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus,
there
are
rules
that
require
specifying
all
the
grounds
for
relief
available
to
the
petitioner,
state
the
facts
supporting
each
ground.
it
seems
to
me
that
those
different
pleading
requirements
suggest
that
what
is
the
relevant
transaction
or
occurrence
for
the
one
is
not
the
same
as
what
is
the
relevant
transaction
or
occurrence
for
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
file...
can
you
file
a
request
for
a
more
specific
statement
in
habeas,
as
you
can
in
a
civil
case?
