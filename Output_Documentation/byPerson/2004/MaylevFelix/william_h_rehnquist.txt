we'll
hear
argument
next
in
deneice

mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chan,
do
you
think
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
should
be
applied
in
habeas
cases
after
aedpa
the
same
way
they
are
in
civil...
other
civil
litigation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
we
were
to
determine
that
in
regular
civil
litigation
it
is
relatively
automatic?
what
would
your
position
be
with
respect
to
habeas
cases
after
aedpa?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
chan.
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
porter,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whatever
the
reason
for
it
is,
certainly
you
can
interpret
the
rules
to
say
that
the
pleading
requirement
being
different
and
much
more
specific,
the
amendment
process
should
be
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
need
an
amendment,
i
don't
think.
if
you're
talking
about
a
transaction,
the
question
is,
what
is
the
transaction?
and
in
habeas
it
may
be
quite
different
than
in
other
civil
proceedings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about...
what
about
the
case
law
in
the
lower
courts
that
justice
breyer
referred
to,
dealing
with
the
core
operative
facts
and
adopting--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
say
let's
look
at
all
the
cases
that
have
followed
tiller,
and...
but
apparently
a
lot
of
the
courts
adopting
the
core
operative
fact
have
developed
that
without
full
regard
to
tiller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
argument
as
to
whether
it
was
properly
done,
whether
the
ruling
was
proper,
is
going
to
go
back
to
the
time
of
the
miranda
interrogation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
that
an
operative
fact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you've
switched.
we
were
talking
about
"operative
fact",
and
now
you
said
"actionable
fact".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
porter.
mr.
chan,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chan.
the
case
is
submitted.
