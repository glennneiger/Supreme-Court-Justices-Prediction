the

justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
discretion
under
15(a),
at
least
in
the
general
run
of
civil
proceedings,
that
is
to
be
liberally
exercised
in
favor
of
the
pleaders,
so
it's
a
different...
the
15(c)
relation-back
test
is
quite
different
from
the
general
attitude
to
pleading
amendments,
"well,
we'll
let
the
plaintiff.
"
or,
here,
the
petitioner,
"make
the
pleading
alteration,
and
then
it
will
be
there,
and
the
court
will
make
a
determination
of
whether
the
pleading
is
good
or
not.
"
but,
at
the
15(a)
threshold,
it's
not
much...
it's
not
much
of
a
screening
device,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
your
definition
of
the
test
under
15(c)(2)?
i
mean,
on
the
one
side,
the
argument
is...
felix's
argument
is,
it's
the
entire
trial
episode,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is
yours
that
every
single
objection
that
might
be
made
in
this
entire
trial
record,
every
one,
is
a
separate
transaction
or
occurrence,
for
purposes
of
15(c)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you,
ms.
blatt,
taking
the
position
that
that
is
a
tighter
test
than
would
apply
ordinarily
to
the
run
of
civil
cases
under
15(c)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
here,
it
was
five
months.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
relying,
ms.
blatt,
at
all
on
the
difference
between
the
pleading
rules
for
civil
cases,
generally,
and
habeas,
where
you
do
have
a
whole
set
of
pleading
rules,
separate
from
the
habeas
rules?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
porter--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--all
that
would
be
required
to
allege,
to
take
the
four-line
complaint...
all
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
say
in
that
tort
case
is,
"the
train
was
negligently
operated",
with
nothing
more
specific
than
that.
and
then
the
particulars
could
come
out
later.
under
habeas,
you
can't
do
that.
you
must
set
out
your
grounds,
and
the...
rule
2
is
very
specific
about
that.
so,
it's
a
very
different
approach
to
what
you
have
to
allege,
going
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
porter,
if
i
understand
you
right,
you
are
saying
that,
in
the
habeas
context,
the
counterpart
to
an
injury
in
a
tort
case
is
the
unlawful
detention,
itself.
am--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
so
if
that's
the
injury,
could
the
habeas
petitioner
come
in
with
a
complaint
that
says,
"i
am
being
detained
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
"
period,
"and
i
need
a
lawyer
to
spell
out
the
details?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
think
that,
first
of
all,
the
amendment
may
be
made
before
there
is
a
defensive
plea.
as
mr.
chan
pointed
out,
the
warden
doesn't
even
get
the
petition
until
it's
been
screened
by
the
court.
the
other
is
the
understanding,
on
the
civil
side,
of
rule
15(a).
it's
a
very
liberal
pleading
rule.
the
threshold
for
granting
permission
to
amend
a
pleading
under
15(a)
is
very
easy
to
pass.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
mayle
v.
felix,
no.
04-563.
this
case
involves
a
state
prisoner
who
petitioned
for
habeas
corpus
relief
in
federal
court.
congress
has
imposed
a
strict
time
limit
on
habeas
petitions
one
year
from
the
date
the
conviction
became
final.
if
a
prisoner
petitions
on
time,
may
he
add
after
the
time
limit
has
run
new
claims
that
differ
in
time
and
type
from
the
claim
he
originally
raised.
we
hold
that
he
may
not.
once
a
time
limit
has
run,
new
claims
can
be
added
to
a
habeas
petition
only
if
they
are
related
in
time
and
type
to
the
occurrences
identified
in
the
initial
timely
petition.
respondent,
felix
was
convicted
of
grave
felonies
in
california
state
court
and
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
his
current
application
for
federal
habeas
relief
sent
us
on
two
alleged
trial
court
errors,
each
involved
the
admission
of
out
of
court
statements
during
the
prosecutor's
case
in
chief,
but
the
two
are
otherwise,
unrelated.
one
alleged
error
concerned
inculpatory
statements
felix
made
during
pretrial
police
interrogation.
those
statements,
he
objected
were
coerced
and
therefore
their
admission
at
trial
violated
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
the
other
alleged
error
involved
a
videotape
of
pretrial
statements
made
by
a
prosecution
witness.
admission
of
the
videotape,
felix
objected,
violated
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him.
felix's
conviction
was
affirmed
on
appeal
and
became
final
in
august
1997.
under
the
one
year
time
limit
imposed
by
federal
law,
felix
had
until
august
1998
to
file
a
federal
habeas
petition.
on
may
1998,
felix
timely
filed
a
habeas
petition
asserting
his
confrontation
clause
challenge
to
the
admission
of
the
videotape
witness
statement.
the
federal
court
in
which
he
filed
his
petition
promptly
appointed
counsel
to
represent
him.
eight
months
later
and
over
five
months
after
the
expiration
of
the
time
allowed
for
filing
a
habeas
petition,
felix
filed
an
amended
petition.
in
it,
he
added
to
the
confrontation
clause
challenge,
a
fifth
amendment
challenge
to
the
admission
of
felix's
own
pretrial
statements.
the
state
urged
that
felix's
fifth
amendment
claim
was
asserted
too
late.

rule
15(c)(2)
permits
an
untimely
pleading

to
relate
back
to

thus

and
only
if
both
the

forth
in
the
original
pleading.
felix
urged
that
his
confrontation
clause
and
fifth
amendment
claims
though
factually
unrelated,
arose
from
the
same
conduct,
transaction,
or
occurrence
thus
meeting
the
rule
15(c)(2)
requirement
because
both
claims
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
same
criminal
conviction.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
holding
that
the
relevant
transaction
for
purposes
of
rule
15(c)(2)
was
the
entire
state
court
proceeding
including
felix's
trial
conviction
and
sentencing.
we
now
reverse.
under
the
ninth
circuit's
comprehensive
definition
of
rule
15(c)(2)'s
conduct,
transaction,
or
occurrence
language,
virtually
any
new
claim
introduced
in
an
amended
habeas
petition
will
relate
back
to
a
federal
habeas
claims
necessarily
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
a
conviction
or
sentence.
looking
to
the
run
of
the
mind
civil
proceedings
that
rule
15(c)(2)
ordinarily
governs,
the
court
has
found
no
reading
of
conduct,
transaction,
or
occurrence
as
capacious
as
the
ninth
circuit's
construction.
decisions
applying
rule
15(c)(2)
in
civil
litigation
show
that
the
rule
relaxes
but
does
not
obliterate
the
statute
of
limitations
to
ease
up
on
but
still
respect
a
legislated
time
bar
relation
back
must
depend
on
the
existence
of
a
common
core
of
operative
facts
that
unites
the
original
and
newly
asserted
claims.
felix's
fifth
amendment
claim
challenging
the
admission
of
his
own
pretrial
statements
tardily
raised
in
his
amended
petition
does
not
in
our
view
relate
back
to
the
confrontation
clause
claim
asserted
in
felix's
original
petition.
although
both
claims
challenge
the
legality
of
felix's
custody,
the
claims
rest
on
no
common
core
effects.
each
concern
a
discreet
episode
in
adjudicating
felix's
fifth
amendment
claim,
the
key
issue
would
be
the
character
of
the
police
interrogation
in
which
felix
made
inculpatory
statements
specifically
did
felix
answer
the
questions
the
police
put
to
him
voluntarily
or
was
he
coerced.
felix's
timely
asserted
sixth
amendment
claim
in
contrast
arose
from
the
prosecution's
use
at
trial
of
a
videotape
statement
made
by
a
witness
who
feigned
memory
loss
during
his
trial
testimony.
plainly,
the
two
claims
different
in
time,
place,
and
type
do
not
share
a
core
of
operative
facts.
if
claims
asserted
after
the
federal
one
year
time
limit
has
expired,
could
be
revived
simply
because
they
relate
to
the
same
trial
conviction
or
sentence
as
it
claims
asserted
on
time.
the
time
limit
would
have
slim
significance.
rule
15(c)(2),
we
emphasize
is
meant
to
qualify,
not
to
repeal
a
statute
of
limitations.
we
therefore
hold
that
relation
back
will
be
in
order
when
the
original
and
amended
petitions
state
claims
tied
to
a
common
core
of
operative
facts
but
not
otherwise.
that
reading
we
are
persuaded
best
comports
with
a
tight
timeline
congress
prescribed
for
federal
habeas
petitions
and
with
the
manner
in
which
rule
15(c)(2)
is
applied
in
civil
cases.

souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
