mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1996,
congress
made
an
important
change
to
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
by
enacting
a
one-year
statute-of-limitations
period.
this
court
is
now
asked
to
consider,
for
the
first
time,
how
the
relation
back
doctrine
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
15(c)(2)
is
to
be
applied
in
the
habeas
context.
the
warden
rule
for
relation
back
is
that
the
conduct
transaction
occurrence
set
forth
in
the
initial
petition
is
the
core
of
operative
facts
to
support
the
constitutional
violations
alleged.
this
rule
is
far
superior
to
the
ninth
circuit's
rule,
which
a
majority
of
circuits
have
determined
effectively
nullifies
aedpa's
one-year
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
i
should
clarify
that--
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
--that
in
civil
rule
15(a),
the
court
has
discretion
and
grants...
needs
to
grant
leave
to
amend
after
a
responsive
pleading
has
been
filed.
however,
a
petitioner
gets
to
file
a
responsive
pleading...
excuse
me,
an
amended
petition,
as
a
matter
of
right,
before
a
responsive
pleading
is
filed.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
in
this
case--
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
--your
honor.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
it
depends,
your
honor.
it
varies
with...
case
to
case.
in
a
lot
of
pro
se--
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
--well,
your
honor,
the
rule
does
not
require
the
state
to
respond
to
petition
until
ordered
by
the
district
court.
and
to
get
back
to
the
question
of
rule
15(a),
even
after
a
responsive
pleading
has
been
filed,
rule
15(a)
does
not
serve
the
same
purposes
as
rule
15(c).
the
statute
of
limitations
is
strict
defense,
which
is
meant
to
apply
whether
the
filing
is
a
day
late
or
a
year
late,
whether
there
is
prejudice,
or
whether
there
is
dilatory
motive.
to
ameliorate
the
harsh
effects
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
rule
15(c)(2)
provides
an
exception
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
that
exception
is
limited
to
the
parameters
of
rule
15(c)(2),
itself.
so
when
the
court
is
provided
with
a
untimely
claim,
it
determines
whether
or
not
that
claim
is
time-barred,
pursuant
to
15(c)(2).
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
for
pro--
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
--i
do
understand,
your
honor.
and
for
pro
se
petitions,
without
counsel,
the
state
is
not
even
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
petition
until
it
is
served
by
the
court.
and
that
occurs
after
the
court
has
made
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
a
responsive
pleading
is
required.
it
can
happen
that
a
petitioner
will
be
able
to
amend
his
petition
after
the
statute
of
limitations
has
already
expired,
and
we
would
not
even
know
of
that
until
after
everything
had
been
done.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
but
even
in
that
scenario,
we
are
still
prejudiced
by
the
fact
that
now
we
have
to
address
additional
claims
that
would
otherwise
be
time-barred.
we
do
not
get
a
chance
to--
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
--well,
i
was
addressing
the
situation
in
which
we...
in
which
we
can
answer
first.
and
i
think
that
i
responded,
in
the
reply
brief,
that
that
would
be
an
onerous
burden
on
the
state.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
well,
that
situation
would
occur
not
as
frequently
as
the
situation
in
which
we
face
an
amendment
after
we
have
notice,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
that's
absolutely
correct.
and
congress
could
not
have
intended
its
statute-of-limitations
rule
to
be...
to
have
its
effectiveness
dependent
upon
the
court
exercise
of
discretion
under
rule
15(a).
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
liberally
granted
amendments.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
no,
your
honor.
the
better
screening
device
is
in
rule
15(c)(2).
as
mentioned,
rule
15(c)(2)
is
the
provision
that
determines
whether
or
not
a
claim
is
time-barred.
and
15(a),
then,
can
determine
whether
or
not
the
claim
can
be
amended
if
it
is
not
time-barred.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
if
the
court
is
referring
to
rule
15(c)(2),
our
argument
is
that
rule
15(c)(2)
is
not
a
rule
of
automatic
relation
back,
in
civil
terms,
in
civil
cases;
and,
therefore,
should
not
be
applied
as
a
rule
of
automatic
relation
back
in
habeas
cases.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
well,
my
argument
would
be
that
the
habeas
rule
11
provides
that,
to
the...
to
the
extent
that
the
civil
rules
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
habeas
provisions
and
rule,
that
they
may
be
applied.
and
i
think
that
rule
11
compels
a
reading
that
if
you
have
one
application
that
is
inconsistent
aedpa's
provisions
and
the
framework
of
habeas
corpus,
and
another
interpretation
that
is
not
inconsistent,
then
you
must
go
with
the
interpretation
that
is
consistent
with
aedpa.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
and
that--
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
--there's
no
question
that...
we
are
not
questioning
that
rule
15(c)(2)
applied
to
habeas
corpus,
but
section
2242
does
not
give
any
guidance
as
to
how
15(c)(2)
should
be
interpreted.
and
i
believe
that
guidance
comes
from
rule
11.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
for
pro
se
petitions
who
have
been
assigned
counsel,
your
honor?
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
i
don't
have
any
statistics
on
that,
your
honor.
but
even
if
it
were
only
five
or
six
months,
that
would--
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
--it
can
be
a
more
serious
problem
in
capital
litigation,
where
you're
dealing
with
many
more
claims,
which
could
be
more
complex,
which
could
require
exhaustion
for
the...
before
the
federal
review.
it
just
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
claim
and
the
nature
of
the
issues
involved.
i
think
that
the
statistics
that
were
cited
in
the
justice
department
study
have
different
dates
for
how
long
cases
pend,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
claim,
whether
it
be
for
prosecutorial
misconduct,
ineffective
assistance,
and
so
forth.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
chapter
154
provisions
do
set
forth
a
fast
track
for
capital
cases
if
the
state
can
establish
certain
appointment
procedures
for
counsel.
however,
it
did
not
speak
to
the
interpretation
of
rule
15(c)(2),
and
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
the
statute
of
limitations
not
apply
to
chapter
153
simply
because
of
chapter
154.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
for
purpose
of
15(c)(2),
our
interpretation
is
that
the
kind
of
transaction
occurrence
is
that
core
of
operative
facts
that
support
the
constitutional
claims.
that
means
that
the
objections...
it
is
not
necessarily
true
that
one
objection
claim
would
not
relate
back
to
a
second
objection
claim.
it
just
depends
upon
whether
they're
closely
related.
in
this
case,
the
claims
are
not
closely
related.
you
have
a
claim
made
of
confrontation...
excuse
me...
confrontation
clause,
by
the
admission
of
williams'
videotaped
evidence;
and
then
you
have
the
admission
of
evidence
of
a
coerced
confession
statement.
however,
it
takes
an
entirely
different
set
of
facts
to
establish
that
new
claim.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
i
think
that
the
respondent
made
a
similar
argument,
based
on
a
res
judicata
claim,
and
it
was
noted
in
the
treatises
that
were
cited
that
you
have
different
intents
behind
res
judicata
and
the
relation-back
doctrine,
and
its
do
not
apply
that
way.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
matthew
k.m.
chan
mr.
felix
assumes
that
congress
knew
about
the
tiller
case,
and
assumed
that
congress
would
know
that
tiller
would
be
interpreted
in
a
way
as
to
allow
relation
back
in
a
situation
such
as
this.
however,
as
pointed
out,
tiller
is
not
a
habeas
case.
rule
15(c)(2)
did
not
even
have
any
application
to
habeas
cases
at
the
time,
until
it
was
decided.
also,
i
wanted
to
respond
to
justice
souter's
earlier
question
about
examples
of
relation
back
in
habeas
corpus
cases.
and
i've
cited
two
examples
on
page
27
of
the
warden's
brief.
unless
there's
any
other
questions,
i
have
no
more
rebuttal.
