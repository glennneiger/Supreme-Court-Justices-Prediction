mr.
chan,
can
i
ask
you
a
question,
based
on
your
experience?
i'm
sure
you've
had
a
lot
of
experience
in
this
area.
this
particular
claim
was
about
six
months
beyond
the
statute
of
limitations
when
he
asked
to
relate
back.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
would
normally
be
the
case,
something
about
that
amount
of
time
would
be
an
issue,
because
it
takes
time
to
process
these,
and
they
had
to
get
counsel
appointed.
and
counsel
comes
in
and
wants
to
amend
the
petition,
usually,
i
suppose,
in
a
pro
se
petition.
is
it...
would
i
be
correct
in
assuming
that
normally
in
cases
of
this
kind
we're
talking
about
a
delay
of
only
a
few
months?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
normally...
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
should
be...
the
petition
may
have
the
benefit
of
the
relation
back
normally
is...
involves
a
delay
of
not
more
than,
say,
five
or
six
months,
in
a
normal
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
still
lose
the
benefit
of
the
statute.
you
lose
an
important
right.
but
i'm
just
wondering
about
how
serious
a
problem
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reason
for
the...
for
defining
the
relation
back
the
way
the
rule
does
is
interest
in
fairness
to
the
defendant
you
don't
want
to
let
him
be
surprised;
whereas,
your
claim,
as
i
understand,
is
really
based
entirely
on
the
interest
in
finality
and
repose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
definition--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
rule
is
really
to
protect
the
interest
in
fairness,
because
interest
in
repose
is
always
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
interest
in
repose
is
always
there.
you'd
always
like
to
preserve
the
defense,
whenever
you
can.
that's
really
what's
at
stake
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
they
all
come
in
just
two
or
three
months
after
the
statute's
run.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
really
not
a
big
deal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
injury--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
suppose,
in
the...
in
the
miranda
violation,
is
introducing
the
evidence
at
the
time
of
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
point.
you
don't
look
two
and
a
half
years
back
just
to...
you
decide
what
happened
at
the
trial.
