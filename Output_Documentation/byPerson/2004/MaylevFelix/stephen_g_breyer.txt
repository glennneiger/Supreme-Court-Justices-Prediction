then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
what's
bothering
me
about
this
case
is,
i
don't
know
that
the
government
needs
to
argue
that
there
is
a
different
rule.
as
i
read
the
lower-court
decisions,
what
they've
done
is
used
the
words
"core
operative
fact".
core
operative
facts
in
a
tort
case,
where
the
engine
of
train
a
runs
into
the
caboose
of
train
b,
is
that
collision.
and
the
decision
that
the
front...
the
locomotive
should
have
been
lit,
as
well
as
the
back
of
the
caboose,
seems,
arguably
at
least,
the
same
operative
fact.
core
operative
facts.
but
to
say
that
a
witness,
in
the
middle
of
the
trial,
was
treated
unconstitutionally
seems,
at
least
arguably,
quite
a
different
set
of
core
operative
facts
from
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
questioned
before
the
trial.
now,
that
seems
to
me
related
to
the
nature
of
habeas,
but
it
still
seems
to
me
that
those
words,
"core
operative
fact",
the
same
words,
work
differently
in
the
two
situations.
and
to
adopt
your
approach
also
strikes
me
as
running
around
the
one-year
statute
of
limitations.
now,
those
are
my
concerns,
and
i
would
appreciate
your
addressing
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
we
go
back?
because
i'm
still
concerned
with
the
fact
that
claim
1,
which
is
a
claim
on
january
2
that
police
arrested
the
defendant
and
didn't
read
him
miranda
warnings
properly;
claim
2
is
a
claim
that,
two
and
a
half
years
later,
the
prosecutor,
during
the
trial,
made
some
prejudicial
arguments.
now,
i
think,
just
common
sense,
do
those
arise
out
of
the
same
core
operative
facts?
absolutely
not.
the
facts
are
totally
different.
the
only
thing
that
brings
them
together
is
that
there
was
a
single
legal
proceeding.
and,
at
the
same
time,
if
i
adopt
this
approach
that
doesn't
seem
to
comport
with
the
common
sense,
i'm
running
around
congress'
effort
with
the
one-year
statute.
so
what
is
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
every
lower
court
that
has...
not
every
one;
you
know
better
than
i...
but
it
seems
like
a
commonly
found
expression
when
lower
courts
have
interpreted
the
rule
15
and
have
looked
to
tiller.
is
that
true,
or
not
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
of
course
not
in
the
habeas
context.
i'm
saying
that
if
we're
trying
to
apply,
in
the
habeas
context,
the
same
test
that's
used
elsewhere
in
the
civil
law,
wouldn't
we
use
the
word
"core
operative
fact"?
or
would
we?
i'm
not
as
familiar
with
this
as
you.
what
is
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
of
course,
we're
trying
to
decide
what
is
the
transaction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so
what
about
the
injury?
what
about
that?
that
the
injury...
the
trial's
over,
say,
six
weeks...
the
injury
takes
place
at
the
time
of
introduction?
or
is
the
injury
the
whole
time
the...
the
guilty
verdict?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
doesn't
the
1981...
given...
maybe
i
don't...
haven't
followed
it
correctly,
but
why
doesn't
the
1981
claim,
then,
relate
back?
i
think
the
injury
that
took
place
from
both
violations
took
place
at
the
time
of
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--forget
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
other
part
of
what's
been
bothering
me?
to
be
specific
about
it,
it
sounds
like
a
very
good
system.
the
system
is,
"habeas
petitioner,
you
file,
within
a
year,
your
petition
with
one
claim,
and
we'll
look
it
over.
"
says
the
judge,
"and
if
it
sounds
like
you
need
a
lawyer,
we'll
give
you
a
lawyer,
and
then
he'll
come
in
with
a
whole
lot
more.
"
and
that's
quite
protective.
but
suppose
you
said
that
to
congress.
they
passed
this
thing.
and
you
say,
"you
know,
your
year
here,
it
doesn't
really
mean
a
year.
"
"it
means
a
year
for
this
initial
filing,
and
then
what's
going
to
happen
is,
they'll
give
him
a
lawyer,
and
he'll
come
back
and
say
the
interest
of
justice,
but,
really,
it
always,
almost
always,
favors
the
petitioner,
and
the
state
isn't
that
fooled,
and,
really,
it's
not
a
problem
for
them,
and.
"
--what
would
that
congress
have
said?
that's...
that
is
very
much
disturbing
me.
