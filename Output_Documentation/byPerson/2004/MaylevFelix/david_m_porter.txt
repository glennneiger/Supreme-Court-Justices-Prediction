mr.
david
m.
porter
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
respond
to
the
finality
concern,
because
i
think
that
really
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
case.
three
weeks
ago,
this
court,
in
rhines
versus
weber,
unanimously
approved
of
the
stay-and-abeyance
procedure,
because
the
petitioner's
interest
in
obtaining
review
of
his
federal
claims
outweighed
the
competing
interests
of
finality
and
speedy
resolution
of
the
federal
petition.
now,
mr.
felix's
case
is
even
more
compelling
than
rhines,
because,
unlike
the
stay-and-abeyance
procedure,
which
is
just
the
power...
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
control
its
docket,
here
we're
talking
about
the
command
of
congress.
in
section
2242,
of
the
judicial
code,
congress
provided,
specifically,
that
the
rules
governing
amendments
of
habeas
petitions
be
controlled
by
the
rules
governing
civil
procedure.
the
only
rule
regarding--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
under
this
court's
decisions
about
how
you
determine
what
congress
did,
congress
operated
against
a
backdrop
of
how
rule
15(c)
was
applied
by
this
court
and
the
lower
courts.
and
in
1948,
when
2242
was
adopted,
tiller
was
very
recent;
it
was
a
1945
case.
it
must
have
been...
we
assume
that
congress,
like
normal
citizens,
know
what
the
law
is,
and
they
developed
the
rule
against
that
backdrop.
mr.
david
m.
porter
that's
a
very
good
point
i'd
like
to
address,
because
i
don't
think
we
hit
that...
upon
that
in
our
briefs.
habeas
2...
habeas
rule
2
does
require
fact
pleading,
but
the
purpose
of
that
is
not
to
give
notice
to
the
other
party,
as
the
solicitor
general
and
the
warden
suggest.
the
petition
is
not
served
on
the
warden
in
habeas
cases,
so
they
don't
even
get
a
copy
of
the
petition;
it
is
filed
with
the
court.
the
purpose
of
the
fact-pleading
requirement
of
rule
2
is
so
that
the
district
court,
under
rule
4
of
habeas
rules,
can
perform
its
screening
function
to
determine
whether
the
petition
is
facially
valid
or
not.
that
requires
some
sort
of
facts
to
be
plead.
and
that's
in
the
advisory
committee
notes.
it's
also
the
requirement
of
2243
of
the
judicial
code,
that
the
district
court
review
the
petition
so
that
wardens
are
not
disturbed
with
every
pro
se
litigant's
petitioner
and
have
to
respond.
mr.
david
m.
porter
i
think
that
that's...
congress
reasonably
could
have
said
that,
and
reasonably
could
have
said
that...
amended
2242,
for
example,
when
it
passed
the
antiterrorism
act,
and
said,
"generally,
yes,
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
apply
for
amendments.
"
but
we're...
there
should
be
a
narrower
rule.
mr.
david
m.
porter
i
think
that
the
only
basis
for
determining
what
"transaction"
is,
you
have
to
look
at
the...
if
you...
if
you're
right,
that
we
should
have
some
kind
of
different
rule
for
habeas
than
all
other
civil
proceedings,
well,
then
it
has
to
be
grounded
in
the
habeas
statutes.
and
if...
when
you
look
at
the
habeas
statutes,
it
says,
"confinement
must
be
in
violation
of
the
constitutional--
"
mr.
david
m.
porter
--"laws
which"--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--well,
i
hope
i
can
put
those
to
rest.
on
the
first
concern,
i
think
that
there
are
differences
between
a
train
wreck
and
habeas.
most
of
my
habeas
cases
are
train
wrecks,
so
i
hope
that's
not...
but
i
think
there
is
a
logical
difference
between
them.
but
i
think
when
you
look
carefully
at
the
case
of
tiller,
those
really
were
very
different
facts
about
the
head
car
not
being
lit
and
the
rear
of
the
locomotive
not
being
lit.
after
all,
those
were
two
separate
legal
claims,
as
well.
mr.
david
m.
porter
the
first
one--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--i
agree,
your
honor,
but
you...
i
think
you
need
to
step
back
and
look
at
the
purpose
for
the
difference
in
the
pleading
rules.
the
purpose
is,
if
the...
if
the
reason
was
that
you
have
to
give
specific
facts
to
put
the
other
side
on
notice,
i
would
say
that
there
is
a
compelling
argument
that
that
should
be...
that
should
inform
this
court's
decision
about
how
rule
15(c)
should
be
read.
but
it's
very
clear,
from
2243
and
from
habeas
rule
4,
that
the
purpose
for
requiring
the
facts
underlying
the
claims
is
not
to
give
notice
to
the
other
side,
but
to
allow
the
district
court
to
perform
its
screening
function
to
determine
whether
the...
whether
the
petition
is
facially
valid
or
not.
if
it's
not
valid,
then
the
warden
is
not
even
served
with
the
petition.
it
just...
the
petition
is
simply
dismissed.
mr.
david
m.
porter
yes,
under
rule
81
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
rule
11,
unless
application
of
that
rule
is
contrary
to,
or
inconsistent
with,
the
habeas
statutes
or
rules,
then
it
is
applied.
mr.
david
m.
porter
first
of
all,
the
response
is
that
the
statute...
the
rule
does
not
use
the
term
"core
operative
facts".
mr.
david
m.
porter
not
in
the
habeas
context.
none
of
those--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--and
wright
and
miller
confirmed
this,
that
actually
courts
have
tried
to
develop
different
tests:
is
it
the
same
evidence
that
they're
going
to
use?
is
it
a
core
of
operative
facts?
and,
in
the
end,
they
say
there's
no
better
test
than
the
one
set
forth
in
the
rule,
and
that
is
conduct,
transaction,
or
occurrence.
mr.
david
m.
porter
right,
but
the
reason
why
is
that
there
is
a
body
of
case
law
that
determines...
that's
told
us
what
that
means.
mr.
david
m.
porter
and
tiller
tells
us
it
means
that
it's
the
events
leading
up
to
the
injury.
and
so,
that's
how,
i
think,
that
that
phrase
has
been
interpreted,
and
that's
what
congress
adopted--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think...
they
don't...
i'm
not
aware
of
those
cases
using--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--no,
the
lower
courts...
the
most
usual
interpretation
of
tiller
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
lower
courts
perform
is
this
idea
of
any
events
leading
up
to
the
ultimate
injury--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--yes,
they
have.
mr.
david
m.
porter
and
you
should
not,
because
what
those
courts
failed
to
do
is,
they
failed
to
appreciate
that
congress
has
already
spoken,
in
two
different
ways.
first,
congress
adopted
2242;
and
when
it
adopted
aedpa,
it
did
not
amend
2242,
and
it
did
not
amend
rule
15(c).
and,
second,
in
death-penalty
cases,
which,
after
all,
is
really
the
only
set
of
cases
where
there
is
an
incentive
to
delay,
congress
specifically
spoke.
and
in
2266(b)(3)(b)
congress
said,
"amendments
to
petitions
shall
not
be
permitted
after
answers
are
filed
unless
the
petitioner
can
make
a
showing
for
a
second
or
successive
petition.
"
now,
this
is
lindh
versus
murphy
all
over
again.
this
is
a
case
where
congress
has
spoken
as
to
chapter
154.
in
lindh
versus
murphy,
it
said,
"that
chapter
will
be...
the
amendment
will
be
applied
retroactively
to
cases
then
pending.
"
they
did
not
do
anything
with
chapter
153
cases.
their
negative
implication,
when
congress
so
specifically
addresses
this
issue
for
one
limited,
narrow
set
of
cases...
and
that
really
make
sense
in
death-penalty
cases,
does
it
not?
when
the
state
gives
the
death-penalty
petitioner
lawyers
for
state
post-conviction
review,
then
all
of
those
claims
are
done
in
state
habeas,
they
are
brought
together,
it
fulfills
the
claim-gathering
function
of
the
antiterrorism
act;
and
then,
very
logically,
congress
determined,
"we
should
have
a
very,
very
strict
restriction
of
amendments.
"
mr.
david
m.
porter
i
don't
believe
so.
in
civil-rights
actions,
there
are...
the
constitutional
rights
at
issue
are
the
injury.
so
one...
if
a
person
started
out
with
saying
their
injury
in
the
civil-rights
action
was
the
admission
of
the
evidence--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--because
there...
it
does
not
relate
to
the
same
injury.
in
habeas,
by
contrast,
the
injury
is
the
custody
that's
in
violation
of
the
constitution
laws
and
treaties--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--of
the
united
states.
mr.
david
m.
porter
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
porter
that's
correct.
and
in
this--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--well,
that
the
that's
the
problem
with
the...
with
the
warden's
proposed
test.
are
these,
quote,
"closely
related
claims"?
that
is
not,
i
suggest,
a...
nearly
a
bright-line
rule
that
would
help
the
district
courts
in
determining
what
is,
and
what
is
not,
part
of
the
same
transaction.
so,
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
real
viable
alternative.
i...
again,
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
go
back...
if
it's
going
to
create
a
different
rule
in
habeas,
it
has
to
have
some
grounding--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--well,
maybe
i
wasn't
following
the
hypothetical
closely
enough.
mr.
david
m.
porter
if--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--okay.
well,
let...
if
we
can
return
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think
these...
we
fit
comfortably
within
the
definition
of
mr.
felix
is
asserting
in
this
habeas
petition
are
trial
rights.
under
this
court's
decision
in
chavez
versus
martinez,
in
this
court's
decision
in
pennsylvania
versus
ritchie,
both
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment
rights
are
trial
rights.
those
statements,
independently,
when
they
were
taken
by
the
same
police
officer,
did
not
violate
any
rights.
they
only
violated
mr.
felix's
rights
when
they
were
introduced
in
the...
in
the
prosecution's
case
in
chief.
mr.
david
m.
porter
i
agree
that
those
facts
are
relevant,
but
it's
the
operative
facts
that
are--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--well,
it
is...
the
operative
fact...
what
makes
it
actionable
is
that
the
statements
were
introduced
at
trial.
mr.
david
m.
porter
if
those
statements
weren't
introduced
at
trial--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--i
believe
those
are
the
same
principles,
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
porter
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
porter
yes.
mr.
david
m.
porter
the
petitioner
could
file
such
a
petition.
they
have
been
called
"placeholder
petitions".
but,
clearly,
under
rule
4
of
the
habeas
rules,
such
a
petition
would
be
subject
to
immediate
dismissal
by
the
district
court,
because
it
doesn't
conform
with
habeas
rule
2,
which
requires
that
all
of
the
claims
be
alleged
and
all
of
the
facts
be
alleged.
mr.
david
m.
porter
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
statutes
of
limitations
are
ubiquitous
in
civil
proceedings.
but
just
as
ubiquitous
is
rule
15(c)
relation
back.
they
go
hand
in
glove.
and
congress,
in
1948,
just
three
years
after
the
tiller
case,
when
it
enacts
2242,
must
have
had
on
its
mind
that
relation
back
goes
along
hand
in
glove
with
the
statutes
of
limitation;
and,
not
only
that,
but
how
relation
back
has
been
construed
by
the
courts.
so
i
don't
think
it's
any
surprise
to
congress
now
all
of
you...
now
all
of
a
sudden
that
we
say,
"oh,
you
know,
by
the
way,
there's
this
relation
back
that's
going
to
give
us
maybe
four
or
five
months
longer
than
the
year.
"
i
don't
think
congress
is
at
all
surprised
by
that.
and
congress
just
adopted
new
rules
of
habeas
proceedings,
in
2004;
didn't
amend
rule
15(c),
didn't
provide
another
rule
in
habeas,
didn't
amend
2242.
and,
as
far
as
the
potentials
for
abuse
here,
the
seventh
circuit's...
judge
easterbrook's
decision
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
ellzey
case
has
been
on
the...
on
the
books
for
more
than
two
years
now.
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
parade
of
horribles
that
the
warden
has
suggested,
about
year-long
delays
and
all
of
these
potential
abuses,
in
fact,
are
allowed
by
the
rule
that
we
seek
here,
that
the
warden
or
the
united
states
would
have
come
to
this
court
and
said,
"look,
here
are
the
abuses.
"
"they
are
happening
right
now.
"
well,
in
fact,
ellzey's
been
cited
twice
in
all...
in
these
years,
by
the
district
court,
to
allow
relation
back.
mr.
felix's
case
has
not
been
cited
at
all
in
a
public
case.
so,
i
think
that
the
parade
of
horribles
is
theoretical
and
not
practical.
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
you
have
rule
15(a)
as
a
backstop.
and
once
the
answer
is
filed,
that
really
cuts
off
any
right
to
file
an
amendment
as
a
matter
of
right.
then--
mr.
david
m.
porter
--in
foman
versus
davis,
this
court
responded
to
that
concern
and
said
that
district
courts
have
ample
authority
under
15(a)
to
deny
amendments
to
petitions...
or
amendments
to
initial
pleadings.
it
said,
for
bad-faith
or
dilatory
tactics,
but
then
said
even
undue
delay...
so
you
don't
even
require
a
showing
of
bad
faith...
for
prejudice
to
the
other
side.
so
all
of
the
concerns
that
the
warden
has
raised
are
specifically
identified
by
this
court
to
give
the
district
court
the
right
to
deny
an
amendment
to
the
petition.
and
so,
i
believe
that
those
powers
in
the
district
court
are
very
ample,
indeed.
plus,
we
have...
the
states
have
their
own
ability
to
protect
themselves.
as
one
of
your
honors
mentioned,
we
have
2266.
if
the...
if
the
states
opt
in,
they
get
the
protections
of
2266.
states
have
their
own
mechanisms.
all
but
six
states
in
the
union
have
statutes
of
limitations,
or
very
firm
laches
doctrines,
that
will
prevent
the
elongated
delays
that
the
warden
is
worried
about
in
this
case.
and
as
far
as
the
notice
provision,
justice
breyer
announced
the
unanimous
opinion
for
the
court
this
morning,
in
durachem,
and
said,
"it
doesn't
take
much
to
give
the
defendant
fair
notice.
"
now,
i'd
like
to
leave
the
court
with
the
judicial
aphorism
that
wisdom
often
never
comes
at
all;
it
should
not
be
rejected
merely
for
coming
late.
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court.
if
there
are
no
more
questions--
