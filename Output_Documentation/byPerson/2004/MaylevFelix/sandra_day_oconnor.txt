justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
was
filed
before
a
responsive
pleading--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--was
filed--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
state
has
a
certain
amount
of
flexibility
in
deciding
when
to
respond,
does
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
case
isn't
as
extreme
as
that,
is
it?
it
has
to
do
with
evidence
admitted
at
trial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
in
the
civil-case
context,
generally,
the
interpretation
has
been
pretty
broad.
and
i
suspect
if
we
try
to
narrow
it
a
lot,
we're
going
to
have
a
lot
of
litigation
about
this
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
you
articulate
the
rule
that
you
want?
be
as
precise
as
you
can,
if
you
would.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
true.
i
mean,
we
can
accept
that,
but
we
still
have
to
interpret
what's
a
transaction
or
occurrence,
i
assume.
and
is
it
open
to
us,
in
the
habeas
context,
to
take
a
narrow
view
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
the
habeas
context,
haven't
the
majority
of
the
circuits
had
a
more
restrictive
rule
than
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
ninth
have
espoused?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
and
so,
i
think
the
question
is,
should
we
follow
the
majority
of
the
circuits?
