justice
david
h.
souter
but
you...
you
have--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
was
going
to
say,
if...
on
the
scenario
that
you
have
raised,
in
which
you
don't
even
know
that
the
petition
has
been
filed,
because
the...
you
don't...
the
court
hasn't
called
for
a
response,
the
whole
rationale
behind
the
narrow
reading
is
absent,
as
i
understand
it,
because
you
point
out
that
the
rationale
for
the
narrow
reading
is
that
the
first
pleadings
put
you
on
notice
as
to
the
case
that
you
have
to
meet.
and
you
shouldn't
then
have
to
be
given
an
entirely
new
case
to
meet
after
you've
been
put
on
notice
and
taken
whatever
preliminary
steps
you've
taken.
but
in
the
scenario
that
you're
talking
about,
you
have
not
been
put
on
notice,
because
you
don't
even
know
there
is
a
petition
there
yet.
you
have
not
been
led
to
prepare
a
case
which
has
now
changed.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
your
rationale
does
not
apply
in
the
case
in
which
you
do
not
yet
have
notice,
and,
hence,
have
not
filed
a
response,
for
that
reason.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that...
the
problem
with
that
is
that
a...
the
whole
point
of
a
relation-back
rule
is
to
get
around
the
time
bar.
that's
why
you
have
them.
and
i
thought
your
argument
was,
"well,
you
shouldn't
allow
them
to
get
around
this
time
bar,
because
we
have
been
put
on
notice,
we
have
begun
to
prepare
our
case,
and
we
should
not
then
be
presented
with
an
entirely
new
case.
"
and
so,
that's
why,
it
seems
to
me,
your
preparation
point,
in
effect,
is
trying
to
limit
a
rule,
the
whole
purpose
of
which
is
to
get
around
the
time
bar.
if
you
don't
have
the
preparation
point,
you
don't
have
an
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
it
would
be.
but,
again,
in
the
case
that
you're
talking
about,
the
very
value
that
you're
arguing
for...
i.e.,
"we
ought
to
be
able
to
rely
on
the
notice
that
we
have
given.
"
--is
an
argument
which
hasn't
arisen
yet,
because
there's
no
factual
basis
to
make
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
the
capital
case,
you've
got
a
specific
provision
in
there.
i
mean,
for
the
capital
case,
which
is
the
one,
i
agree,
you
worry
about
most,
because
there's
reason
to
delay
there,
congress
provided
specifically
for
states
to
opt
in;
and
when
they
opt
in,
they
get
the
benefit
of
pretty
rigorous
time
bars.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so,
why...
i
mean,
isn't
the
answer
to
the
capital-case
problem
exactly
the
answer
that
congress
gave,
and,
if
a
state
does
not
want
to
opt
in,
then
the
normal
amendment
rules
apply?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
about--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
how
that
would
work
in
this
case.
the
original
claim
is
that
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation
in
admitting,
you
know,
unlawfully
seized
evidence.
later,
the
petitioner
wants
to
amend
to
claim
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
because
counsel
totally
overlooked
the
leading
case,
directly
on
point,
on
this
particular
evidence.
is
that
arising
out
of
the
same
operative
set
of
facts,
or
is...
or
is
that
something
different?
clearly,
the
facts
are
not
exactly
the
same.
close
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
if
that's...
if
that's
the
line
you're
going
to
draw,
then
it
seems
to
me
that,
in
effect,
what
you
are
saying
is,
you
can't
amend.
because
i
can't
imagine
an
operative
set
of
facts
that
are
going
to
be
much
close
than...
in
the
real
world,
than
the...
than
the
two
sets
that
i
gave
you;
and
if
they're
not
close
enough,
you're
really
arguing
for
a
no-amendment
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
not
if
you
were
the
judge.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but,
i
mean,
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
you
can
amend...
you
can
amend
your
factual
basis,
as
it
were,
but
you
can't
amend
your
claims.
