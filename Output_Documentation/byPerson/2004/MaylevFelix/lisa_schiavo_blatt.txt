ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
relevant
conduct,
transaction
or
occurrence
in
the
habeas
context
is
the
set
of
facts
that
are
asserted
in
support
of
the
particular
grounds
for
relief
under
habeas
rule
2.
that
reference
point
best
preserves
congress'
intent
under
aedpa
to
accelerate
the
filing
and
disposition
of
habeas
proceedings.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
our
fundamental
point
is,
there
is
no
counterpart
to
tort
or
contract
action,
with
habeas.
there
is
just
no
analog.
and
that
is
because
there's
not
only
rule
2,
which
imposes
this
heightened
across-the-board
fact
pleading
requirement,
but
it's
also
because
those
pleading
rules
work
in
tandem
with
all
the
other
unique
habeas
rules
that
apply
only
to
habeas
that
serve
to
narrow
the
timing
and
scope
of
habeas
review.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yeah,
i
just
don't
think
it's
different,
both...
regardless,
you've
got
to
come
the
case
and
figure
out
what
is
the
relevant-conduct
transaction
or
occurrence
in
a
habeas
petition.
and
there's
the
extreme
view
of
viewing
it
as
the
entire
trial
or
conviction,
or
there's
another
view
as...
look
at
it
as
what
the
habeas
rules
require,
and
that
is
the
prisoner
to
identify
a
particular
unconstitutional
conduct
or
occurrence
that
gives
rise
to
a
basis
for
relief.
now,
under
the
ninth
circuit's
view,
a
prisoner
can
timely
file
one
claim
and
then
add
any
number
of
completely
different
claims
after
the
one-year
period.
for
instance,
a
timely
batson
challenge
could
then...
after
the
one
year,
the
claim
could
add
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
brady
violations,
or
coerced
confession.
and
to
have
to
resolve
those
claims
would
significantly
extend
the
limitations
period
beyond
the
one-year
period.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's...
well,
that's
true,
it
takes
in
trial
errors,
but
that's
a
lot.
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
is
a
trial
error.
coerced
confession,
confrontation
clause,
discriminatory
selection
in
the
jury...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
that's
a
trial,
or
maybe
pretrial...
but
it
does
take
in
a
lot,
and
i
don't
think
there's
a
close
call
that
they
relate
to
different
actors,
different
time
periods--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i'm
not
sure
about
that.
this
has
been
the
rule
in
the
majority
of
circuits
for
five
or
six
years
now,
since
1999
or
2000,
and
it
hasn't
generated
a
lot
of
problems.
and
that's
because,
justice
o'connor--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it
would
be
the
set
of
facts
that
are
asserted
in
support
of
the
grounds
for
relief
in
the
original
habeas
petition.
and
the
reason
why
this
hasn't
generated
a
problem,
justice
o'connor,
is
that...
and
the
way
the
courts
of
appeals
haven't
really
had
to
identify
a
test...
is
because
they're
so
disparate
in
time
and
type.
you
have
an
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel
claim
that's
timely
raised,
and
then
there's
discriminatory
selection
of
the
jury.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
concede
that...
it's
hard
to
answer
that,
justice
kennedy,
because
a
habeas
proceeding
is
not
a
train
accident.
and
there
is--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--in
the
civil
context,
you
always
have
a
question
of,
do
we
let
in
other
loan
transactions
in
a
breach
of
contract,
or,
do
we
let
in
another
pattern
or
practice
or...
of
similar
products?
i
mean,
there's
line-drawing,
when
it
comes
up
in
the
civil
context,
all
the
time,
every
day
in
district
courts.
but,
justice
kennedy,
in
habeas
there
are
more
than
ordinary
principles
of
finality
at
stake
that
aren't...
that
just
aren't
true
in
any
tort
or
contract
action.
and
this
court
said
that
in
the
calderon
decision.
and
the
reason
is
because
of
the
interest
in
not
just
the
prosecutor
in
having
adequate
notice--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
would
be--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that
would
be
totally
acceptable,
because
of
the
distinct
interest
in
not
only
the
finality
in
the
interest
of
society,
and
repose--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
it's
not
like
there's
a
habeas
civil
proceeding
that
we're
asking
for
a
habeas...
habeas
proceeding
to
be
different.
there
is
no
counterpart
to
a
tort
action
or
a
contract
action
where
it's
liberal
pleading
requirements
under
rule
8,
and
every
single
grounds
for
relief
in
a
habeas
proceeding
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
prisoner
actually
identify
all
the
grounds
and
the
particular
facts
in
support
of
that,
and
those
heightened
pleading
requirements
focus
the
proceeding
on
that
particular
transaction.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
we'd
look
to
the
common
core.
and
i
think
we
would
argue
that
one
is
focusing
on
counsel's
performance,
and
the
other
is
on
police
misconduct.
but,
justice
souter--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--there's
amendment
all
the
time
in
the
majority
of
circuits
that
have
applied
the
government's
test,
and
it
comes
up
in
two--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
that's
not
true,
justice
souter.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
because--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--let
me
just
say,
on
the
attorney-ineffectiveness
one,
it's
completely
besides
the
point
what
the
government's
view
is,
because
the
claims
are
completely
derivative,
and
the
prisoner
gets
no
benefit
whether
he
gets
the
amendment
or
not,
because,
in
order
to
show
procedural
default,
he's
going
to
have
to
show
attorney
effectiveness,
and
he
just
doesn't
get
anything
additional,
one
way
or
the
other,
and
it
really
doesn't
matter
which
claim
he
asserts
first.
but
the
reason
why
amendment
occurs
all
the
time
is
because
our
rule
allows
the
prisoner
to
amplify
facts
such
that
if
he
raises
a
miranda
claim
or
a
strickland
claim,
and
doesn't
allege
custody
or
doesn't
allege
prejudice
under
strickland,
he
can
amend,
after
the
one-year
period.
and
also--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
the
way
you
get
claims,
which
is
really
the...
the
direct
text
on
the
rule
says
you
can
add
a
claim
if
it
arises
out
of
the
same...
is
if
the
transaction
relates
to
the...
to
give
you
an
example,
to
an
involuntary
confession,
you
could
have
an
amendment
of
a
miranda
claim
that
arises
out
of
that
police...
alleged
police
misconduct
that
culminated
in
the
admission
of
the
confession.
you
could
also
have
a
massiah
violation
that
related
back
to
a
fifth
amendment
claim.
and
you
could
have
other
types,
too.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
i
think
the
interest
of
notice
is
part
of
it.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
always
trigger
when
the
state
hasn't...
or
the
federal
government
hasn't
answered.
but
statute
of
limitations
are
not
only
about
fairness,
in
terms
of
preserving
evidence,
but
the
interest
in
repose--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--and
closure.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
that...
it's
to
preserve
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
if
the
relevant
transaction
is
something
narrower
than
the
conviction,
then
the
interest
of
repose
sets
in.
and,
i
mean,
the
other
side
has,
you
know,
the
same
point...
it's
if
you
draw
it
out
broad
enough--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
i
think
what's
at
stake
is
congress'
intent
in
passing
the
one
year.
and
it's
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
that
to
have
a
prisoner
timely
file
one
claim
and
then
potentially
add
an
unlimited
number
of
claims,
no
matter
how
different
and...
in
time
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--a
six-month
difference
is
a
50-percent
extension
of
the
limitations
period,
which
is
a
big
deal.
and
congress
wanted
a--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
it
was
five
months.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it
was
five
months.
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--may
i
answer?
i
think
we're
relying
on
both
habeas
rule
2
and
the
principles
under
aedpa
on
finality.
