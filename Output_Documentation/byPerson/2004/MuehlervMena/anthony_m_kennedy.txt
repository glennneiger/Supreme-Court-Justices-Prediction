justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
has
the...
the
objection
to
the
instruction
been
preserved
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are...
are
you
saying
that
the
only
basis
on...
on
which
the
jury
could
have
ruled
for
the
homeowner
here,
the...
the
respondent,
is
that
she
was
handcuffed
for
too
long?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
you
have
to
say
that.
otherwise,
we
have
to
uphold
the
jury
verdict,
if
we
can
assume
that
the
jury
might
have
thought,
well,
you
know,
the
handcuffs...
the
police
had
a
right
to
do
that,
but
she
was
held
too
long,
she
was...
they...
they
yelled
at
her,
she
was
taken
into
a...
a
place
that
was
uncomfortable,
blah,
blah,
blah.
if...
if
that's
true,
then
we
have
to
sustain
the
jury
verdict.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
but
the
instruction
that
was
given...
and
one
was
read
that's
in
the
briefs...
it
seems
to
me
a...
a
perfectly
good
instruction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
was
the
plaintiff's
obligation
to
submit
a
clarifying
instruction
and
to
bring
this...
the
denial
of
that
instruction
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
find
that
the...
that
the...
do
you
define
the
end
of
the
search
as
before
they
started
videotaping
everything
they
had
done?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
it
does
seem
to
me
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it...
it
does
seem...
seem
to
me
that
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
is
questionable
on...
on
this
key
point
of
when
she
had
to
be
released.
the
officers
should
have
released
her
when
it
became
clear
she
posed
no
immediate
threat
and
did
not
resist
arrest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that
is
critical
to
its
holding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
implies
that
they
have
a...
a
duty
at
the
outset
to
determine
whether...
what
her
status
is
rather
than
to
go
around
looking
for
guns
and...
and
to
secure
the
premises.
that's...
that's
one
of
my
concerns
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the
first
ground
being?
just
an
unreasonably
long--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--doesn't
that
just
go
to
the
point
that
it's
not
clearly
established
at
least?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
was
ill
individual,
a
single
individual--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--unclothed,
et
cetera--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what...
what
will
do
if
we
thought
the
ninth
circuit
was
egregiously
wrong
on
that
and
that
its
opinion
was,
to
use
the
most
polite
word,
disingenuous
when
it
talked
about
a
garage?
that...
that
was
somewhat
off-putting
to
me
when
it
was
a
converted
garage
with
a
bed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i...
i
thought
this
woman
was
standing
in...
by
some
grease
rack
or
something
and
she
was--
