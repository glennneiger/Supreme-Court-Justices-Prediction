mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
start
on
the
issue
of...
that
mr.
phillips
said
we
made
up.
actually
we
didn't
make
it
up.
the
claim
that
ms.
mena
was
detained
past
the
time
of
the
search
was
made
throughout
the
case.
if
you
look
at
footnote
3
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
2000,
the
issue
of
the
length
of
the
detention
was
a
factual
issue
that
precluded
summary
judgment.
ms.
mena
claimed
that
the
detention
lasted
for
2
to
3
hours.
the
officers
claimed
that
it
lasted
90
minutes.
but
more
than
that,
the...
the
jury...
the...
the
special
verdict
asked
the
jury
to
find
whether
ms.
mena
had
been
kept
for
a
longer
time
than
reasonable,
and
in
fact,
in
the
closing
argument,
it
was
argued
that
ms.
mena
had
been
kept
beyond
the
time
that
the
search
ended.
and
not
only
is
there
not
any...
not
only
is
there
evidence
in
the
record,
there
is
overwhelming
evidence
in
the
record
that
ms.
mena
was
kept
for
a
period
of
time,
at
least
30
minutes,
give
or
take,
and
possibly
as
long
as
an
hour.
and
this
is
not
based
on
ms.
mena's
testimony.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
they
were
videotaping
during
the
course
of
the
search.
but
if
i
can
go
through
the
facts
which
might
clarify
things.
officer
muehler,
who
was
the
officer
in
overall
charge
of
the...
of
the
search,
testified
at
trial
that
the
search
ended
at
8:40
a.m.
officer
brill
said
a
little
bit
later
than
that.
he
tied...
but
there's
a
second
video.
there
are
two
videos.
the
second
video
is
from
8:50
to
8:57.
at
the
time
that
the
second...
the
second
video
started
at
8:50,
officer
brill
testified
that
the
search
was
over.
the...
the
evidence
log...
the
last
entry
on
the
evidence
log
is
8:45
in
terms
of
evidence
being
logged
into
the...
into
the
case.
officer
brill
testified
that
ms.
mena
was
kept
for
at
least
10
or
15
minutes
after
the
end
of
the
second
video
and
her
handcuffs
were
not
released
until
she
was
brought
back
around
from
the...
the
separate
converted
garage
back
into
the
house
and--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--the
testimony...
officer
brill's
testimony?
is
actually...
they
cite
joint
appendix
number...
on
75
where
he
says
he
doesn't
recall.
on
the
next
page,
in
joint
appendix
number
76,
he's
asked...
they
continue
to
ask
the
question.
and
isn't
it
your
memory
that
about
10
or
15
minutes
after
that,
iris
mena
was
released?
that
would
sound
consistent.
and
that's
10
or
15
minutes
after
8:57.
in
addition,
ms.
mena
testified
that
she
was
kept
between
2
or
3
hours,
and
that
was
actually
consistent
with
prior
testimony
by
the
videographer
herself,
who
testified
in
deposition
and
was
impeached
at
trial,
that
it
was
2
or
3
hours
that
the
search
lasted.
the...
the
point
being...
and
if
you
take
the
distance
between
officer
muehler's
testimony
and
officer
brill's
testimony,
ms.
mena
was...
was
kept
in
handcuffs
at
the
end
of
a
very
long
detention
in
handcuffs,
for
a
period
of
approximately
27
to
33
minutes,
if
you
don't
even
take
ms.
mena's
testimony
into
account.
and
one
of
the
ironies
of
the
case
is
that
there's
testimony
that
mr.
romero,
the
actual
target
of
the
case,
was
released
at
8:45
at
the
time
the
search
ended.
and
so
while
this--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--no.
but
in
fact,
this
was
a...
the
search
warrant
was
for
two
premises.
he
was
picked
up
at
his
mother's
house.
and
in
fact,
officer
muehler
had...
was...
was
to
radio
the
start
of
both
searches,
and
so
there
was--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--yes.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
they
were
looking
for
a
gun.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
think
the
warrant
covered...
i
think
they
were
looking
for
the
gun
wherever
it
was
found,
and...
and
the...
i
believe
the
warrant--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--yes.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
it's
the
same
warrant
i
believe,
your
honor,
in
terms
of...
we
don't
have...
there's
not
a
lot
of
information
in
the
record
about--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--no,
no,
no.
it...
it
referred
to
the
two
houses,
one
on
cimmaron.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
yes.
the
location
number
one
is
his
mother's
house,
2646
cimmaron,
and
that's...
and
officer
muehler
and
this
team
was
in
charge
of
both
of
these
searches
pursuant
to
the
same
warrant.
they
had
information
that...
the
reason
they
did
that
is
that
they
had
information
that...
that
he
lived
in
this
poorhouse,
that
he
rented
a
room
from
the
menas
at
the
poorhouse,
and
that
he
also
visited
his...
his
mother
from
time
to
time.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
they
knew
right
away.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
think
that
that
explains
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
jury
imposed
punitive
damages
here
because
they...
they
knew
that
at
8:45,
at
the
time
that
officer
muehler
said
that
the
search
was
over
and
all
the
officers
were
out
of
the
house
and...
and
everything
was
done,
that
mr.
romero
was
cited
and
released
for
marijuana
possession.
and
at
the
same
time,
from
8:45
until
sometime
after
9
o'clock,
probably
as
long
as
30,
maybe
longer,
iris
mena
was
sitting
in
a
cold,
damp,
converted
garage
with
her
hands
behind
her
back.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
yes.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
i'd...
i'd
say
that
the...
the
court
could
affirm
the
judgment
in
this
case
and
the
verdict
in
this
case
on
the
ground
that
we--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--and
in
fact...
and
i...
i
think
that
would
be
the
appropriate
thing
to
do.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
right.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
right.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
think...
i
think
that
there...
i
would
divide
my
response
to
that,
justice
breyer,
into
two
parts
really.
on
the
questioning
issue,
i
would
just
say
that
that...
that
was
not
an
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
jury
for
its
verdict
as
a
separate
fourth
amendment
violation.
it
wasn't.
and
we
didn't
argue
it
in
the
ninth
circuit.
what
we
did...
we
did
say
in
our...
in
our
brief
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
she
was
questioned
about
her
immigration
status
about
an
issue
that
was
unrelated
to...
to
summers
detention.
we
did
say
that.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
right.
so,
i
mean,
i...
i
think
on
questioning,
you
know,
we...
we
haven't
been
pushing
that
issue.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think
what...
first
of
all,
it's
a
separate
alternative
holding.
what
they
said
is
that
there
was
a
separate
fourth
amendment
violation
while
they
affirmed
on
the
basis
that
we
actually
won
on.
the
jury
found
that
she
had
been
detained
longer
than
was
reasonable
and
with
more
force
than
was
reasonable.
this
is
a
jury
verdict.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
that.
and
we've
argued
in
our
brief
that
if
the
court
did
something
on
questioning,
it
would
really
be
issuing
an
advisory
opinion
in
this...
in
this
situation.
and,
you
know,
we've...
we've
argued
the
point
and
we're
prepared
certainly
to
argue
about
the
merits
of
that
question
because
it's
obviously
an
important
question.
in
our
view,
the
questioning
issue
should
be
governed
by
the
more
traditional
terry
kind
of
idea
that
you
can't
question
when
it
goes
beyond
the
scope
of
the
limited
purposes
of
the
intrusion,
but
we
also
understand
that
that's
contested.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
would
have
a
different
position
on
that.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
the
judgment
can
actually
be
affirmed
on
the
first
ground
regardless
of
this
issue
because
it
was
a...
a
jury
verdict
and...
and
the
damages
were
asked
for
either/or
in
terms
of
question
5
or
6.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
detained
beyond
the...
the
length
of
the
search.
and
i
think
technically
the
judgment
can
be
affirmed
on
that
ground.
but
with
respect
to
the
handcuffing,
the
position
that
we
would
say
is
that,
first
of
all,
you...
you
would
have
to
view
the
facts
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
verdict.
now,
it's
been...
there's
been
a
lot
of
questioning
about
what
that
means
and
what
the
jury's
role
is.
as
we
understand
it,
if
ornelas
applies
to
this
decision,
which
we
assume
the
court
would
do...
and
that
is,
that
you
would
first
have
to
take
the
light...
all
the
facts
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
verdict,
including
the
possibility
that
the...
the
jury
rejected
as
being
incredible
the
statements
that
the
officers
made
in
terms
of
justification,
if
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
there
was
contradicting
evidence,
which
there
is
in
this
record.
and
so
the
facts
that...
that
the
other
side
has
tried
to
argue
are
the
facts
on
which
you
would
make
that
constitutional
decision
are
not
the
facts
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
verdict.
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
verdict,
there
was...
there
was
lots
of
planning.
there
was
a
tactical
plan
in
writing
that
the
jury
got
to
see,
which
said
that
the...
the
plan
here
was
to
go
in
and
make
the
swat
entry,
to
see
if
there
were
non-suspects
there.
they
would
be
patted
down,
identified,
and
released.
the
jury
was
entitled
not
to
believe
the
other
side's
claim
that
they
didn't
say
when
they
were
going
to
be
released
and
believed
that
the
plan
was
to
release
them
as
soon
as
it
was
ascertained
that
they
did
not
have
the
connection
in...
in
the
situation.
and
in
fact,
there's
testimony
from
the
officers
that
they
knew
that
they
weren't
gang
members
and
they
knew
that
they
weren't
connected
to
the
crime.
and
they
were
completely
cooperative,
and
they
didn't
resist
arrest
and
they
didn't
flee.
and
iris
mena
is
5
foot
1...
5
foot
2
inches,
and
the
jury
had
a
videotape
of
exactly
how
they
looked.
the
officers
had
a
total
plan.
they...
they
exercised
their
command
of
the
situation
from
the
beginning.
they
cleared
it.
they
made
sure
it
was
safe.
they
took
people
outside
through
the
pouring
rain,
which
actually
they
say
there
wasn't
evidence
about
that.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
actually
at...
at
joint
appendix
number
183,
officer
allegra,
who
was
one
of
the
entry
team,
said
it
was
pouring.
so...
and
in
fact,
the
stipulation
of
facts
said
it
was
heavy.
so
iris
mena
was
being...
was
being
demure
when
she
talked
about
that.
you
can
even
see
the
rain
on
the
videotape.
and
so
they
took
her
outside.
they
took
all
of
them
outside.
they
put
them
in
this
little
room,
which
is
not
connected
to
the
house.
they
had
one
or
two
armed
officers
outside.
there
was
no
place
for
them
to
go.
they
couldn't
interfere
with
the
facilitation
of
the
search
because
they
were
in
this
room.
they
couldn't
flee
because
there's
only
one
way
out,
a
door.
there
were
two
armed
guards
there.
and...
and
if
all
they
had
to
do
was
sit
these
four
people,
who
were
not
connected
to
any
gang
activity,
as
to
which
they
had
no
suspicion
ever
developed
that
they
had
any
connection
to
mr.
romero,
who
had
already
been
arrested
at
his
mom's
house--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
but...
but
officers
do
make
that
call
all
the
time.
they
make
it
in
the
context
of
terry
stops.
they
make
it
in
the
context
of
lots
of
fourth
amendment
issues.
in
summers...
in
summers,
the
man
was
detained.
in
many
of
the
post-summers
cases,
including
many
cited
by
the
other
side
and
the
government,
handcuffing
is
not
viewed
as
routine.
handcuffing
is
viewed
as
something
that
substantially
aggravates
the
nature
of
the
seizure--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i...
i
understand
that.
i
guess
the...
the
problem
with
that
is
that
that
means
that
no
matter
who
they
find...
and
in
this
case
is
a
good
example
of
it.
they
were
worried
that
they
might
find
the
gang
member
who
had
a
gun
there,
and
that's
what
they
were
looking
for.
okay.
and
so
they
used
the
swat
team.
that
seems
perfectly
reasonable
that
they
would
use
a
swat
team
the
way
they
did.
and
they
went
in
and
within
literally
4
or
5
minutes,
they
had...
this
is
a
tiny,
little
house.
they
had
cleared
the
house.
they
had
figured
out
all
the
occupants.
they
put
them
in
a
room
completely
under
their
control
where
they
couldn't
get
away
from
anything.
they
knew
there
were
two
40-year-old
people,
a
young
hippie,
and...
and
an
18-year-old
girl
that
was
5
foot--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--yes.
they
searched
that
room.
so
the
room
was
searched
before
they
went
there.
they
searched
all
the
rooms.
they
searched
ms.
mena's
room
and
found
absolutely
nothing
there.
and...
and
the
testimony...
and
this
goes
to
justice
souter's
question.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
oh,
yes.
they...
they
searched
the
individuals.
they...
they...
you
know,
they
completely
made
sure
that...
that
when
they
put
them
in
that
back
room,
there
was
nothing
in
the
room.
there
was
nothing
on
the
individuals.
there
was
nothing
that...
that
could
cause
them
danger.
and...
and
the
jury,
i
think,
was
entitled
to...
to
look
at
those
facts
and...
and
to
hear
the
facts
and
to
see
the
facts--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
at
the...
at
the
district
court
level,
the...
the
district
court
heard
a
rule
59.
but
one
of
the
things
about
this
case
is
it
was
tried
right
around
the
time
that
saucier
v.
katz
came
out,
and
in
the
ninth
circuit,
there
was
a
question
about
who
got
to
decide
qualified
immunity.
this
was
june
2001
actually.
and
so
there
was
a
rule
59
motion
about
whether
the
proper
standard
of
qualified
immunity
had
been
applied.
the
district
judge,
looking
at
the
facts,
found
that
there
were
facts
to
sustain
the
verdict,
including
evidence
that
ms.
mena
had
been
kept
after
the
end
of
the
search.
the
district
judge
found
that.
and
then
in...
in
the
ninth
circuit,
of
course,
the
ninth
circuit's
published
opinion
deals
with
qualified
immunity
on
both
of
these
issues.
and
basically
the...
the
qualified
immunity...
on
the...
on
the
over-detention
claim,
i
think
they've
conceded
that
there
just
isn't
any
justification
for...
i
mean,
a
de
minimis
exception
doesn't
extend
to
30
minutes.
i
mean,
that...
this
court
has
debated
whether
15
or
20
is
too
long
on
a...
on
a
terry
stop
when
there's
actually
reasonable
suspicion.
here,
there's
nothing
to
hold
her.
with
respect
to
the
handcuffing
issue--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
in
viewing
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
verdict,
i
think
the
court
has
to
assume
that...
that
the
jury
could
have
found
an
hour.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
based
on
the
officer's
own
testimony
alone,
viewed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
verdict,
it's
at
least
27
to
32.
and
so
you've
got
something
that
just
could
not
possibly
be
considered
de
minimis
under
any
kind
of
exception.
and...
and
that's
why
they
fought
it
on
the
facts.
they
haven't
even
made
an
argument
on
the
law
at
any
point
in
this.
and
with
respect
to
handcuffing,
i
think
our
position
on
the
handcuffing
is
that
summers,
first
of
all,
doesn't
deal
with
handcuffing.
and
the
other
side
has
consistently
tried
to
equate
detention
with
restraint.
and
i
think
what...
what
summers
indicated
was
that
this
court
was
willing
to
allow
people
to
be
detained
during
the
course
of
a
search
for
three
specific
reasons.
and
when
balancing
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
against
the
justifications,
this
court
specifically
said
it
was
endorsing
a
limited
intrusion,
and
that
it
wouldn't
be
very
much
different
asking
someone
to
sit
around--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
no.
i...
i
don't
think
that
is
the
case,
justice
kennedy,
because
in...
in...
summers
doesn't
authorize
what
they
did.
graham
certainly
talks
about
having
to
justify
force
based
on
a...
on
a
fourth
amendment
analysis.
and
franklin
v.
foxworth,
which
is
a
ninth
circuit
case
that
happened
before
this
case,
the
court,
first
of
all,
used
the...
the
analysis
that
we
have
argued
is
appropriate
based
on
summers
and
graham
to
decide
that
a
particular
summers
detention
was
carried
out
in
an
unreasonable
manner.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--no.
i...
i
understand
that
the
facts
were
more
egregious,
but
the...
the
court's
analysis
for
a
reasonable
officer
from
a
qualified
immunity
standpoint...
for
a
reasonable
officer
reading
that
opinion,
you
draw
at
least
three
conclusions
i
think.
one
is
that
the
proper
analysis
to
determine
whether
handcuffing
or
some
additional
form
of
restraint
is...
is
allowed
has
to
be
decided
under
the
kinds
of
justifications
that
summers
provides
and
under
a
graham
analysis
when
it
comes
to
force.
and
there's
lots
of
cases
that...
that
allow
officers
to
do
that.
lots
of
lower
court
cases.
in
fact,
our
view
is
all
the
lower
court
cases
follow
that
kind
of
analysis
and
just
come
out
differently
depending
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
confronted.
the
second
thing,
the...
the
point
about
the
disabled
person
and
the
particular
facts
made
that
case
particularly
egregious,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
those
were
additional
factors,
not
the
line.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
say
that
the
constitutional
standard
was
particularly
abusive
or
egregious.
it...
it
applied
traditional
fourth
amendment
analysis.
and
finally
and
i
think
very
important
and
not
dealt
with
maybe
in
the
briefs
as
much
as
it
should
be
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
in...
in
franklin
rejected
a
blanket
handcuffing
policy.
that's
what
the
policy
was
in
portland.
the
portland
police
department
had
a
policy
that
said
you
are
to
handcuff
everybody
until
the
search
is
over.
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
you
can't
have
that
kind
of
policy
because
summers
and...
and
graham
require
it
to
be
individualized
justification
for
that...
for
an
additional
intrusion
beyond
the
limited
intrusion
that's
allowed
in
summers.
and
in
fact,
in
summers,
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
to
compare
with
what
the
court
was
allowing
to
what
it...
to...
to
the
circumstances
in
dunaway,
to...
to
circumstances
that
start
to
look
like
an
arrest.
and
i
don't
know
how
much
more
intrusive
you
could
be
than
what
these
officers
did
to
iris
mena,
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the...
the
issues
here.
if...
if
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i...
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
it's
certainly...
it's
certainly
an
alternative
ground.
it's
not...
it
doesn't
affect,
i
think,
our
verdict.
and
so
i
think
what...
i
mean,
i
suppose
the
court
could
dismiss
that
question
as
improvidently
granted,
could
say
to
the
court
that
it...
that
it
should
reverse
that
part
of
the
ruling.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
that...
you...
you
could
say
that.
i
mean,
i
would...
on
the
merits
of
the
question,
i...
i
would
like
to...
if
we
were
reaching
that,
i
would
argue
that
the
ninth
circuit...
that...
that
there
is...
there
should
be
a
limit
on
questioning
in
a...
in
a
summers
detention,
and
the
court
should
apply
the
kind
of
terry
analysis
that
the
majority
of
the...
the
circuits
apply.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
mean--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--she
wasn't
standing
by
a
grease
rack,
but
she
was
made
to
sit
initially
by
an
open
door
because
the
door
had
basically
been
obliterated
on
a
very
cold,
rainy
february
morning
where
she
was
very
cold,
and
after...
and
had
been
taken
through
the...
the
pouring
rain
in
bare
feet
and
with
only
a
t-shirt
and
was
left
there
for
at
least
20
or
so
minutes
without
being
given
a
coat
or
shoes.
and
she
was
made
to
sit
by
there
and
she
was
very
cold
and
uncomfortable.
and
she
did
complain
that
the
handcuffs
were
too
tight
and
she
complained
that
they
were
uncomfortable
and
could
they
be
removed.
it's
not
a
garage
in...
in
the
way
that
the
vision
of
it,
but
also
if
you
look
at
it,
it's...
and
the...
the
jury
did
look
at
it
because
it
had
a
videotape
of
this.
you
could
see
that
the...
the
occupants
were
made
to
be
in
a
very
uncomfortable
situation
that
was
unnecessary.
and
that...
that
was
clearly
established
law
in
the
ninth
circuit
certainly
under
franklin
that
the
manner
of
a
search
that
was
unnecessarily
prolonged
or
painful
or
an
unnecessary
invasion
of
privacy
was
clearly
established
law
in
the
ninth
circuit
as
of
1994.
i
think
in
the
heitschmidt
case,
which
is
very
similar
in
a
lot
of
ways
to
our
case,
that
came
out
after
the
search,
but
applied
the
same
reasoning
to
a
1994
search.
you
had
the
same
kind
of
handcuffing
of
a
non-suspect
as
to
whom
the...
the
officers
didn't
have
that...
that
kind
of...
of
suspicion.
and
the
fifth
circuit
found
that
that
was
a
violation
and
denied
qualified
immunity
to
the
officers.
so
from
our
standpoint,
on
the
issue
of
being
detained
past
the
time,
i
think
it's
just
a
clear
case.
i
think
the
other
side
has
conceded
that
if...
if
there's
this
evidence
in
the
record,
which
there
is,
the
judgment
has
to
be
affirmed
on
that
basis.
on...
on
the
handcuffing
issue,
we
believe
the
same
principle
has
to
apply
because
the
facts
have
to
be
viewed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
verdict,
and
when
you
view
those
facts,
i...
it...
it
is...
no
reasonable
officer
would
believe
you
could
do
those
things
to
ms.
mena
in
these
circumstances
based
on
the
law
at
the
time.
and
i
think
that
it
would
be...
what
the...
what
the
united
states
and...
and
what
petitioners'
counsel
is
asking
for
is
really
for
a
radical
change
of
law
themselves.
we're
happy
with
summers
and
graham
and
the
way
that
applies,
and
the...
the
jury
instruction
was
based
on...
on
summers
and
graham
and
on
franklin.
the
language
is
taken
directly
from
those
cases.
and...
and
the...
the
jury
in
a
case
like
this...
qualified
immunity
obviously
provides
some
protection
for...
for
officers
that
when...
when
a
reasonable
officer
wouldn't
know
these
things.
but
jury
verdicts
also
play
a
crucial
role
in
a
civil
rights
case.
in
this
case,
a
jury
of
our
community
found
that
iris
mena
had
been
subjected
to
an
abuse
of...
a
specific
abuse
of
authority
in
being
held
beyond
the
time
of...
of
the
search,
even
at
a
time
when
the
prime
target
was...
was
free
to
go
about
his
business
with
a
citation,
and
was
held
in
these
painful
handcuffs
for
a
period
of
over
2
hours
in
circumstances
where,
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
she
was
treated
much
more
harshly
than
anything
this
court,
i
think,
contemplated
in
the
summers
case.
and
i
think
that
officers
know
how
to...
officers
know
how
to
handle
the
fourth
amendment
issues
involved
in
this
case.
they
don't
need
a
special
rule
because
that
rule
would
end
up
meaning
that
when
you
go
in
and
you
don't
find
what
you're
afraid
of,
that
everybody
is
still
going
to
be
subjected
to
this
kind
of
serious
intrusion
on
their
individual
liberty.
and
so
we
would
urge
the
court
not
to
go
down
this
new
path
that
the
united
states
and
the
petitioners
are
asking
and
to
affirm
the
judgment
because
it
was
based
on
clearly
established
principles
that
this
court
and
other
courts
around
the
country
have...
have
established.
thank
you
very
much.
