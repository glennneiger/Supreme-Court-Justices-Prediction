justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is
the...
what
is
the
function
of
a
jury
in
this
case?
what
does
the
jury
verdict
stand
for?
and
the
jury
doesn't
return
a
special
verdict
and
says
we
find
x,
y,
and
z.
it
finds
whether
the
police
exercised
excessive
force,
and
that's
all
we
know
from
the
jury
verdict.
other...
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
these
cases
should
go
off
on
summary
judgment
or
even
a
demurrer.
you
assume
all
the
facts
as
the
plaintiff
alleges
them
and
then
the
court
decides
whether
that
adds
up
to
unreasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we
don't
know
the
fact...
what
facts
were
found
because
all
we
have
is
in
the
jury
verdict
that
this
was
excessive
force.
period.
that's
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
like
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
defendant
negligent.
is
that
more
or
less
a
conclusion
of
law?
we
don't
know
in
what
respect
from
the
jury
verdict.
and
here,
were
these
police
officers
acting...
did
they
use
excessive
force.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
the
facts
there,
there
were
no
handcuffs.
he...
he
was
just
detained.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
why...
why
there
was...
there
was
a
special
verdict
of
sorts,
not
a
detailed
one.
but
the
two
questions,
question
5
and
question
6,
on
page
255
of
the
joint
appendix--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--one
question
concerns
whether
the
force
was
excessive,
and
the
other
one
is,
do
you
find
that
she
was
detained
for
a
longer
period
than
reasonable?
those
two
questions...
my
first
is
a
procedural
question.
did
counsel
for
the
defendants
object
to
the
jury
getting...
those
two
questions
being
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
judge
is
asking
the
jury
in
these
questions,
one
is
whether
there
was
a...
a
detention,
was
force
greater
than
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances,
and
whether
the
duration
was
longer
than
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
this
case
should
not
have
gone
to
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
what
you
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
you...
you
just
said
that
this...
the
handcuffs...
the
circumstances...
the
circumstances
here
were
reasonable
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
know
how
you
can...
you
can
say
that
the
only
thing
that
was
before
the
jury
was
the
handcuff
when
the...
there
was
evidence
that
she
was
treated
very
roughly
in...
in
the
first
instance,
she
was
woken
from
her
sleep,
she
wasn't
told
that
they
were
police,
she
thought
they
were
robbers,
and
she
feared
for
her
life.
that
doesn't
drop
out
of
the
case
and
what
the
jury
was
asked
to
determine.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where...
where
is
that
testimony?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
from
these
premises.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
the...
i
thought
that
this
poorhouse,
or
whatever
it
was
called...
that
the
warrant
covered
weapons
that
were
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
they
were
looking
for
weapons.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
were
not
looking
for
a
gun
at
romero's
mother's
house,
were
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
they
have
a
warrant,
a
search
warrant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
this
was
a...
this
was
a
pretty
extensive
search
warrant
that
they
had.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
they
have
something
like
that,
the
same
kind
of
warrant
for
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
wasn't...
i
thought
that
this
warrant
referred
to
a
particular
address,
a
particular
house,
not...
not
any
house
where
one
might
find
romero.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
was
the
other
house
his
mother's
house?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
that
would
make
it
even
more
curious
if
the
place
where
the
dangerous
man
was
wasn't
searched
extensively
and...
and
the
mother...
nobody
was
put
in
handcuffs,
and
yet
for
this...
they
knew
pretty
soon
that
romero
wasn't
on
the
premises.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
and
that's,
i
guess,
your...
your
point,
that
the
place
where
the
dangerous
man
was
is
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--medium...
medium
rain.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no...
there
was
no
objection
to
that
question
going
to
the
jury,
was
the
duration
unreasonable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
jury--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
jury
answered
the...
just
the
general
question,
was
the
duration
unreasonable,
and
the
jury
said
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
the
district
court
got
it
right
and
the
ninth
circuit
wrote
a
poor
opinion,
why
should
we
upset
the
judgment
in
the
case?
in
other
words,
if
what
we
had
here
was
a
trial
that
was
okay,
a
district
judge
that
behaved...
gave
a
proper
charge,
then
the
ninth
circuit
writes
an
opinion
that
doesn't
seem
to
deal
with
what
the
district
court
and
the
jury
decided.
