chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.03-1423,
muehler
against
mena.
during
a
search
of
the
premises
occupied
by
respondent,
she
was
detained
and
handcuffs
and
questioned
about
her
immigration
status.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
use
of
handcuffs
and
the
questioning
violated
the
fourth
amendment
rights.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
first,
mena's
disambient
was
plainly
permissible
under
our
opinion
in
michigan
against
summers,
and
the
use
of
handcuffs
to
effectuate
the
detention
was
reasonable.
second,
the
officerâ€™s
questioning
of
mena
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment
because
it
was
not
an
independent
seizure.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
stevens
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg,
and
breyer
join.
