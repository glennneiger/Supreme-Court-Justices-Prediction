well,
it
doesn't...
why
is
contraband
magical?
wouldn't...
wouldn't
your
point
be
when...
when
the
reason
they're
investigating
gives
cause
to
believe
that
there
may
be
physical
danger--
justice
antonin
scalia
--from
letting
people
wander
around?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
the
case
with
contraband,
but
would
be
the
case
for
many
other
reasons
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
the...
the
mere
fact
it...
it
went
to
the
jury,
even
went
to
the
jury
without
your
objecting
to
it,
does
not
mean
we
have
to
listen
to
what
the
jury
said.
is
that...
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you...
is
your
objection
that
the
jury
wasn't
given
enough
guidance
on
excessive
force,
or
is
it
that
the...
that
the
ultimate
issue
of
excessive
force
is
not
a
jury
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
is...
is
excessive
force
an
issue
of
historical
fact
any
more
than...
than
unreasonable
search
or
unreasonable
seizure
is
an
issue
of
historical
fact?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
an
historical
fact
how
long
you
held
the
person,
whether
the
person
was
in
handcuffs,
but
the
ultimate
question
was,
you
know,
is
this
force
excessive.
is
that
any
different
from
the
question
as...
of
was
this
seizure
unreasonable?
if
you
submit
the
one
to
the
jury,
you
may
as
well
submit
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
when--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
you
know
all
those
facts,
you're
willing
to
send
it
to
the
jury
to
say,
given
all
of
these
facts,
it's
up
to
you
to
decide
whether
unreasonable
force
was
used
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
matter
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
any
more
so...
why
any...
any
more
so
than...
than
whether
it's
an
unreasonable
seizure?
justice
antonin
scalia
if...
if
two
of
the
reasons
that
the
ninth
circuit
gave
are
in
our
view
incorrect,
why
wouldn't
we
reverse
and
remand
for
them
to
do
it
without...
to
make
the
judgment
without
taking
those
two
factors
into
account?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can't
have
a
flat
rule
that
while
you're
conducting
a
search,
you...
you
can
restrain
anybody
that
you
find
assuming
the
search
is
for
a
crime
that...
that
involves
violence.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
to
have
to
make
that
call
all
the
time,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that
it
was
30?
