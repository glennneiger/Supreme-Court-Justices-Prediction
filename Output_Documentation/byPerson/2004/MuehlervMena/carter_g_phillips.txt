mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
safety
of
police
officers
when
they
attempt
to
execute
a
search
warrant
in
an
inherently
unsafe
situation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
do
believe
that
a
qualified
immunity
issue
is
bound
up
with
the
underlying
merits.
it
was
addressed
that
way
by
the
ninth
circuit
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--this
court--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--this
court
in
procunier
treated
the
qualified
immunity
issue
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
underlying
merits
of
the
case
and...
and,
in
fact,
skipped
over
the
question
of
what
1983
meant
in
order
to
address
the
qualified
immunity
issue.
and
presumably--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
court
could
do
the
same
thing
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
this...
this--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
in
the
first
instance,
it's
reasonably
clear
to
me
that
you're
not
bound
by
the
jury's
determination
here.
this
court
has
already--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--with
respect
to
the
historical
facts
of
the
case,
who
did
what
to
whom,
of
course,
you
have...
that...
that's
subject
to
clearly
erroneous
review.
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
conduct
at
issue
here
is
reasonable,
that's
an
issue
of
law
or
at
least
a
mixed
issue
of
fact--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
law
that
this
court
has
decided
as
de
novo.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it...
it
seems
to
me
that...
justice
breyer,
that
the
answer
to
all
of
those
questions
go
to
the
core
of
what
it
means
to
exercise
unquestioned
command
of
the
situation,
which
is
a
pure
legal
standard
that
this
court
adopted
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
in
michigan
v.
summers.
and
that's
a
question
of
law.
to
be
sure,
there
are
lots
of
elements
of
it,
but
what
my
position
would
be...
and
obviously
the
officers'
position
in
this
case...
is
that
in
exercising
unquestioned
command,
you
can
accept
all
of
the
facts
as
you've
just
described
them
and
none
of
that
is
excessive
because
it
doesn't
expose
anyone
to
anything
other
than
what
is
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
complete
control
under
the
circumstances
in
order
to
ensure
the
protection
of
the
individual
officers
and...
and
candidly
of
the
other
individuals
who
were
being...
being
detained,
all
four
of
them,
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
justice
o'connor.
my...
my
basic
answer
to
that
is
that
this
court
already
addressed
that
issue
in
procunier.
it
considered
that
the
qualified
immunity
issue
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
issue,
even
though
it
hadn't
been
presented
in
the
question
presented,
and
indeed,
i
think
in
this
case
it's
actually
a...
a
stronger
argument
that
qualified
immunity
is
in
this
case
because
that
is
the
way
that
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
addressed
the
issue.
it
looked
at
under
saucier.
it
evaluated
whether
or
not
qualified
immunity
was
appropriate
and...
and
did
the
two-part
test,
the
first
part
being
whether
it
was
a
constitutional
violation
and
the
second
part
whether
or
not
it
was
reasonable
under
these
particular
circumstances.
so
if
i...
if
i
cannot
persuade
you
that
this
is
constitutional,
which
obviously
i...
i
hope
i
can
do,
it
seems
to
me
absolutely
unquestioned
that
there...
that
what
the
officers
did
here
under
these
circumstances
were
perfectly
reasonable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i...
i'm
not
saying
that
that
would
be
true
in
all
cases.
i
do
think
in
this
particular
case
you
did
not
need
to
have
a
jury
verdict.
we
would
have
been
prepared
to
stipulate
to
the
facts
as
they
were
found
ultimately
and...
and
giving
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
inferences
to
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
that's
just
a
conclusion
of
law,
justice
ginsburg.
so
the...
the
facts
that
you
know
are
the
facts
as
they're
described--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--by
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
know
precisely
what
they
did.
they
kept
her
in
handcuffs
throughout
the
duration
of
the...
of
the
search.
we
know
that.
there's
no...
there
are
no
additional
claims
as
to
having
mistreated
her
physically.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
think
there
is
a
factual
question
like
that
because
i
don't
think
that
question
was
presented
to
the
jury,
and
it
was
certainly
not
the
basis
on
which
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
jury's
verdict
in
this
case.
there...
there
was
never
an
argument
made
to
the
jury
that
this...
that
this
extended
beyond
the...
the
period
of
the
end
of
the
search.
the
argument
that
was
made
to
the
jury
was
that
the
search
should
have...
should
have
been
limited
to
the
room
where
the
suspect
was...
was
a
resident
or
that
the
police
should
have
made
a
decision
somewhere
in
the...
before
the
end
of
the
2-hour
search
that
she
was
no
longer
a
threat
to
them.
and
then
they
were
arguing
that...
that
it
even
went
a
little
further
in
terms
of
the
timing
of
it.
but
they
never
asked
the
jury
to
find
that
that
15
minutes
was
the
basis
for
a
fourth
amendment
violation
in
its
own
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
if
the
jury
had
been
asked
to
make
that
finding,
that
you...
and...
and
the
jury
determined
that
there...
that
it
was
unreasonable,
then
i
think
you'd
have
to
conclude
that
the
15
minutes
were,
in
fact...
that
it
did,
in
fact,
go
beyond
15
minutes.
i
do
think
there
is
still
a
legal
issue
as
to
whether
that's
de
minimis
under
the
circumstances.
but...
but
i
agree.
i
mean,
obviously
there
is
a
role
for
the
jury's
findings,
and
you
have
to
give
them
a
certain
amount
of
respect.
but
on
the
core
questions
of
reasonableness
and
suspicion
and
whether
or
not
the
police
exercised
unquestioned
command
and
what
those
terms
mean,
this
court
has
already
decided
that
in
the
fourth
amendment
context
it
has
to
decide
those
issues
as
a
matter
of
law
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
all
police
officers
and
not
simply
do
it
on
the
basis
of
whatever
a
particular
jury
would
say
in
a
particular
circumstance.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the...
all
of
the
grounds
actually.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
if
this
court
could
determine
that,
as
a
matter
of
course,
the...
the
standard
operating
procedures
in
a
particular
way,
that
might
certainly
inform
the
court's
fourth
amendment
analysis.
that...
i
think
what's
important
to
keep
in
mind
in
this
context,
though,
justice
souter,
is
we're
talking
about
four
individuals
who
are
being
detained
under
these
circumstances,
and
each
of
them
poses
a
distinct
issue
for
the
police
officers
under
the...
under...
when
trying
to
decide
how
best
to
proceed.
one
of
them
had
been
found
with
marijuana
in
his
possession.
one
of
them
had
been
determined
to
be
an
illegal
alien,
and
the
other
two
were
individuals
about
whom
the
police
knew
virtually
nothing.
so,
you
know,
is
it
possible
that
police
procedure,
generally
speaking,
when
you're
talking
about
a
single
occupant
of
the
residence,
oftentimes
concludes
that
he
can
take
away...
you
can
remove
the
handcuffs?
that
may
be,
although
i
don't
think
there's
much
in
the
record
here
to...
to
reflect
that.
but
what
the
police
said
here...
and
i
think
it's
extraordinarily
important.
officer
muehler
testified
that
if
something
had
gone
wrong,
if
either
a
police
officer
had
been
injured
or
one
of
the
occupants
of
that
house
had
been
shot
or
otherwise
harmed
as
a...
in
the
context
of
executing
the
search
warrant,
the
first
question
that
would
have
been
asked
is
what
was
the
least
that
could
have
been
done
to
prevent
those
injuries
from
occurring.
and
he
said
to
himself
and
he
said
it
quite
rightly...
and
it's
a
rule
this
court
ought
to
embrace
under
the
unquestioned
command
theory
of...
of
law...
is
that
if
we
keep
them
in
handcuffs
through
the
duration
of
a
reasonable
search,
we
will
make
our
way
through
the
search
much
more
rapidly,
much
more
efficiently
in
order
to
minimize
the
detention
and
we
will
eliminate...
and
i
mean,
literally
eliminate...
the
entirety
of
the
risk
either
to
the
individuals
themselves,
the
occupants,
the
detainees,
or
to
the
police
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm...
i'm
quite
comfortable
with
the
way
the
court
analyzed
it
in
michigan
v.
summers,
that
the
officer
is
not
required
to
evaluate
the
extent
of
the
intrusion
to
be
imposed
by
the
seizure.
that
is,
you...
you
have
a
categorical
rule
that
allows
you,
in
the
ordinary
course,
to
do
whatever
is
reasonably
necessary
in
order
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
understand
that,
and...
but
my...
my
position
is
that
handcuffs
don't
materially
affect
the
detention
under
these
circumstances
other
than
to
assure
what
the
court
said,
which
is
unquestioned
command
of
the
situation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
but
it's
important
to
put
that
in
context
because
summers
is
a
narrow
exception
to
the...
not
an
exception.
it's
a
narrow
circumstance
under
the
fourth
amendment.
you
have
to
have
a
search
warrant.
it
has
to
be
a
validly
issued
search
warrant
so
that
we
know
that
there
has
either
been
a
crime
that's
likely
to
be
taking
place
in
the
premises.
it
only...
it
only
extends
to
the
residents,
occupants
of
the
house,
and
it's
only
when
the
search
is
for
contraband,
not
just
for
any
evidence.
so,
for
instance,
when
the
police
go
the
60th
time
to
michael
jackson's
estate
to
go
try
to
find
evidence
of
whatever
is
going
on
there,
i
don't
think
it's
reasonable
to
go
in
and
handcuff
michael
jackson
and
anybody
else
who
happens
to
be
on
site.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
scalia--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--absolutely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
important
point
here
is
that
we're
talking
about
guns.
these
are
gangs.
these
are
guns.
this
is
a
circumstance
that
is
inherently
more
dangerous
than
any
other
circumstance
the
police
are
likely
to
confront.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it...
it
could
have
been
a
basis
for
the
jury's
verdict
if
they
had,
in
fact,
put
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
they
were
detained--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
that...
i
understand
that,
justice
stevens,
but
the
point
we
made
in
our
reply
brief
is
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
this
record
and
it
was
never
argued
to
the
jury
that
this
search...
that...
that
her
detention
lasted
beyond
the
period
of
the
search
in
this
case.
indeed,
counsel
for
the
police
officers
specifically
said
in
his
closing
argument,
there
is
no
issue
but
that
she
was
released
at
the
time
of
the...
that
when...
as
soon
as
the
search
was...
was
ended,
the...
the
warrant
was
executed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because...
because
what
he's...
well,
you
know,
it's
a
reasonable
instruction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
justice
ginsburg.
we
didn't.
and...
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
justice
ginsburg,
you
have
to
put
that
in
context.
the
argument
of
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
that
the
detention
should
have
ended
at
either
of
two
points:
after
they
had
completely
cleared
the
area
and
made
it
safe,
or
alternatively,
at
some
point
after
that
when
they
had
asked
her
questions
and
determined
that
she
had
no
particular
involvement
with
mr.
romero.
their
argument
was
anything
after
that
was
unreasonable,
and
that's
what
the
jury
certainly
found,
was
that
that
was
the
reasonable
break
point.
our
argument
is
that's
not
consistent
with
the
notion
of
unquestioned
command
and...
and
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
there
is
no
evidence...
no
evidence.
there
was
no
testimony
that
she
was
kept
for
a
period
beyond
the
execution
of
that
search
warrant.
it's
very
important
to
understand
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
if
it's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law,
that's...
then
that's
absolutely
right.
but
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
they
kept
going.
the
only
thing
he
said
was,
he...
he
didn't
remember.
that
was...
the
question
was
put
to
the
police
officer.
was
she
kept
beyond
there?
he
said
he
didn't
remember.
he
wasn't
even
the
police
officer
who
was
involved
in
it.
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
of
that.
it's
totally
made
up.
it
wasn't
their
theory
of
the
case
in
front
of
the
jury.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
i
want
to
start
with
essentially
the
question
that
justices
breyer
and
kennedy
raised,
which
is
what
do
you
do
when
you
know
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
wrong,
that
the
questioning
here
violated
the
fourth
amendment,
and
what
do
you
do
when
you
know
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
in
saying
that
the
officers
have
an
affirmative
duty
in
the
middle
of
a
summers
detention
to
make
an
assessment
on
an
individualized
basis
as
to
the
risks
posed
by
any
individual
detainee.
those
are
rulings
that
i
submit
to
you
are
plainly
erroneous
and
warrant
reversal
on
that
basis
alone.
at
that
stage,
if
the
respondent
wants
to
argue
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
that
15
minutes
is,
in
fact,
proved
by
the
facts
of
this
case,
that's
fine,
but
understand,
those
issues
were
put
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
affirm
on
the
alternative
ground
that
there
were
15
minutes
here.
the
ninth
circuit
expressly
never...
or
didn't
expressly
but
never
said
one
word
about
a
period
of
time
after
the
search
ended
in
this
particular
case,
and
that's
not
an
accident
because
there
is
no
testimony.
the
officer
said
he
didn't
remember
and
when
asked,
well,
would
10
to
15
minutes
be
consistent
with
your
memory,
well,
of
course,
it
would.
he
didn't
remember
anything.
so
there's
nothing
in
that
evidence,
and
there's
no
way...
i
have
looked
at
that
tape.
i
ask
you
to
look
at
that
tape.
i
guarantee
you
there's
no
way
you
can
draw
any
inference
as
to
at
what
point
in
this
process
she
was
released
vis-a-vis
the
end
of
this
particular...
this
particular
search
being
executed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
assume
you
have
the
tape.
it's
part
of
the
record.
it
should
be
in
the
clerk's
office.
if
you
don't
have
it,
i'd
be
more
than
happy
to
send
you
a
copy.
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
course
not,
justice
ginsburg,
because
the
issue
before
the
jury
was
whether
or
not
the...
we
had
an
affirmative
duty
to
make
an
evaluation
in
the
middle
of
the
search
as
to
whether
or
not
she
posed
a...
a
threat.
that
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--their
theory
of
the
case,
and
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
said,
is
yes,
we
do
have
that
affirmative
obligation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
of
the
search.
of
her
detention.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
of
her
detention.
and
that
was

on
the
jury's
determination
that
we
had
detained

beyond

done
the
sweep.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the...
the
court
of
appeals'
obligation
here
was
to
evaluate
our
argument
that
we
should...
we
were
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
court
of
appeals
put
forth
what
it
regarded
as
the
most
legitimate
bases
on
which
to
affirm
the
judgment
in
this
case.
the
fact
that
neither
of
those
withstand
serious
scrutiny,
justice
ginsburg,
seems
to
me
to
be
a
basis
for
reversing
the
ninth
circuit
and
allowing
the
matter
to
go
back
at
this
point.
and...
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
does
in...
you
know,
said
it
will
do
in
ornelas,
that
it
is
a
de
novo
review.
punitive
damages,
exactly
like
a
punitive
damages
cases.
juries
make
punitive
damages
determinations
every
day
and
every
day
courts
of
appeals
and
trial
judges
review
those
damages
awards
de
novo
because
they...
because
the
question
is
not
just
what
are
the
historical
facts...
that
you
give
deference
to
the
jury
on...
but
on
the
fundamental
question
of
what
is
the
rule
of
law
that
will
govern
the
police
officers
in
the
execution
of
search
warrants
in
circumstances
like
this.
they
need
protection,
your
honor.
thank
you.
