justice
david
h.
souter
now,
in
doing
it
as
a
matter
of
law
here,
should
we
give
consideration
to
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
if...
if
i
remember
correctly,
one
of
the
officers
testified
that
had
they
followed
normal
protocol,
once
they
had,
i
think
his
phrase
was,
secured
the
building,
the...
the
main
building--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
that
the
whole
compound?
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
that
they
would
have...
they
would
have
taken
off
the
immediate
restraints,
and
he
wasn't
sure
why
they
didn't.
we...
do
we...
do
we
consider
that
when
we're
crafting
our
statement
of
law
as...
as
to
what
is
or
is
not
excessive?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i
take
it
you
obviously
don't
want
us
to...
to
come
down
with
a
kind
of
a
finicky
version
of...
of
excessive
force
as
the
touchstone,
and
i
take
it
you
don't
want
us
to
come
down
with
simply
a
blanket
rule
saying
that
essentially
the
police
can
do
anything
in...
in
restraining
occupants
so
long
as
it
is
not
wantonly
cruel.
somewhere
in
between.
do
you
have
a...
a
statement
that
would
be
the
kernel
of
the
holding
that
you
want?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
i
mean,
i
don't...
would...
would
you
say
handcuffs
are
per
se
lawful
for...
for
purposes
of
applying
summers?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on
the...
on
the
question
whether
they
preserved
the
issue,
i...
i
took
it,
implicit
in
what
you
said
a
minute
ago,
that
yes,
they
did
not
object
to
the
submission
of
the
question.
they
did
not
object,
in
effect,
to
an
instruction
or
giving
of
an
instruction
as
such.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they...
they
had
moved
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence,
and
that's
enough
to
preserve
the
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
your
position
was
that
it...
it
may
be
submitted
to
the
jury,
but
that
it
may
be
reviewed
as
a
question
of
law
simply
because
that's
the
way
we
are
able
to
set
standards
for
later
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
they...
did
they
search
the
individuals
too
to
make
sure--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
assume
they
did.
