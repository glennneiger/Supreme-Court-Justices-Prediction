mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
executing
a
search
warrant
to
investigate
a
violent
crime,
officers
may
routinely
use
reasonable
restraints
on
detained
occupants
in
order
to
exercise
unquestioned
command
over
the
situation
and
to
facilitate
the
orderly
completion
of
the
search.
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
holding
that
the
officers'
use
of
handcuffs
in
this
case
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
under
the
standard
for
excessive
force
claims
first
articulated
by
this
court
in
graham
v.
connor,
as
informed
by
this
court's
decision
in
michigan
v.
summers,
the
degree
of
force
used
here
was
not
excessive.
the
same
considerations
that
justified
the
detention
of
the
occupants
in
summers,
most
notably,
the
paramount
concern
of
ensuring
the
safety
of
the
officers
and
the
occupants
themselves,
will
ordinarily
justify
the
precautionary
use
of
handcuffs
during
the
detention.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
we--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct.
it
is
our
view
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
officers
would
have
been
entitled
to
prevail
on
the
constitutional
issue
with
regard
to
excessive
force.
and
it's
worth
noting,
i
think,
that
the
officers
did
move
for
summary
judgment.
they
also
orally
moved
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
at
the
close
of
the
evidence,
and
that
motion
was
denied.
now,
we
also
believe
that
the
jury,
quite
frankly,
was
given
insufficient
guidance
on
the
excessive
force
issue,
and
to
turn
to
the
jury
instruction
cited
by
justice
stevens
at
page
203,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
jury
only
received
one
very
general
instruction
on
summers
detentions.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
perhaps
an
argument
could
be
made
that
it's
fairly
included
within
the
questions
presented.
there
was
an
objection
made
at
trial
and
an
objection
made
before
the
ninth
circuit
as
well,
but
our
fundamental
position
is
that
the
jury
was
simply
given
insufficient
guidance
on
the
excessive
force
issue.
this
instruction--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that's
correct.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
think
that's
true.
it
is
true
that
they
didn't
object
to
the
specific
special
verdict
set
of
questions.
i
think
they
proposed
slightly
different
language.
but
ultimately
i
think
our
primary
submission
is
that
as
a
matter
of
law
on
these
facts,
no
constitutional
violation
occurred.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
we
would
concede,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
the
issue
should
go
to
the
jury
where
there
are
disputed
issues
of
historical
fact.
we
would
submit
that
there
are
no
relevant--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
there
are
certain--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--justice
scalia,
those
facts
may
be
disputed
in
a
particular
case.
we
would
submit
that
they
really
weren't
disputed
here,
but
there
may
actually
be
a
dispute
where
the
officers
would
say,
yes,
we
used
handcuffs
and
the--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--or
no
we
didn't
use
handcuffs.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
we
believe
that
it
is--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
and
once
the
historical
facts
are
established,
it
is
essentially--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
we
would
submit
that
it
is
no
different
from
the
question
whether
officers
had
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
on
any
given
set
of
historical
facts
which
this
court
held
in
ornelas
was
a
question
subject
to
de
novo
review,
over
your
dissent,
admittedly.
and
we
believe
that
the
primary
rationale
for
the
rule
in
ornelas
also
applies
here,
namely
that
officers
do
need
to
have
a
consistent
set
of
substantive
guidelines
by
which
they
can
judge
the
validity
of
their
conduct.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
we
believe
that
that
certainly
is
the
primary
issue
that
was
at
stake.
and
in
fact--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
think
that
the
handcuffing
was
the
key
factor
at
trial,
and
i
think
that
the
best
evidence
of
that,
quite
frankly,
is
that
respondent
in
her
proposed
instructions
referred
only
to
handcuffing
in
her
excessive
force
instruction.
unfortunately,
that's
not
part
of
the
joint
appendix.
it
is
part
of
the
record.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
think
that
that's
true,
but
i
think
that
the
instruction
didn't
really
provide
any
guidance
on
excessive
force
specifically.
it
was
really
an
instruction
with
regard
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
detention
more
generally,
rather
than
with
regard
to
excessive
force
specifically.
it
was
not
a
graham
v.
connor
type
instruction.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
there
were
objections
to
the
instruction
below,
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
perhaps
an
argument
could
be
made...
and
perhaps
mr.
phillips
will
make
the
argument
on
rebuttal...
that
it
is
fairly
included
within
the
questions
presented.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
justice
ginsburg,
it
was
the
primary
issue
before
the
jury,
and
to
be
sure,
there
were
other
issues.
i
think
that
the
other
relevant
use
of
force
was
the
initial
detention
at
gunpoint,
but...
and
those...
and
i
would
add
that
those
are
the
two
factors
on
which
the
ninth
circuit
relied
in
affirming
the
jury's
verdict.
our
submission
is
that
both
with
regard
to
the
initial
use
of
force
and
with
regard
to
the
continued
use
of
force,
the
justifications
of
graham
v.
connor
support
the
officers'
use
of
force
in
both
instances.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
assuming
that
that
instruction
is
correct...
and
that
might
very
well
be
a
valid
instruction--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--it
may
very
well
be
a
correct
instruction--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--with
regard
to
a
challenge
to
the
manner
of
the
detention
itself.
in
that
instance,
then
the
jury
does
have
a
certain
amount
of
leeway,
but
i
think
even
then
the
teaching
of
ornelas--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--it
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
and
the
jury's
job
is--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--the
jury's
job
is
to...
to
resolve
the
underlying
factual
issues
and
then--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--we
believe
that
that
actually
is
ultimately
a
judge
issue
in
the
same
way
that
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
probable--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that's
correct--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
think
that's
exactly
right,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
teaching
of
ornelas.
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
a
more
specific
instruction
should
have
been
given
so
as
to
make
clear
that
the
jury
had
specific
issues
of
historical
fact
to
resolve.
but
ultimately
we
do
believe
that
it's
a
question
of
law
in
the
sense
that
it
should
be
reviewed
de
novo
for
precisely
the
reasons
given
in
ornelas.
and
if
i
could
just
say
a
couple
words
on
the
substantive
issue
of
excessive
force.
we
believe
that
in
cases
involving
violent
crimes,
officers
should
routinely
be
allowed
to
use
handcuffs.
in
this
case,
i
would
just
add
that
there
were
several
additional
case-specific
factors
that
justified
the
use
of
handcuffs.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
violent
crime,
the
officers
had
reason
to
believe
that
at
least
one
and
possibly
two
members
of
a
violent
gang
were
living
at
the
house.
in
addition,
the
officers
had
previously
visited
the
house
on
two
occasions
to
investigate
other
violent
crimes
and
had
encountered
resistance
on
at
least
one
of
those
occasions.
and
our
fundamental
problem
with
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
is
that
it
seems
to
suggest
that
officers
in
the
course
of
a
detention
should
really
stop
and
investigate
whether
or
not
each...
each
individual
that
they
encounter
poses
a
safety
threat.
and
we
believe
that
that
rule
is
as
unworkable
as
it
is
unwise.
it
would
effectively
divert
officers
from
the
primary
task
at
hand
and
could
perversely
have
the
effect
of
prolonging
rather
than
expediting
the
completion
of
the
search.
and
for
that
reason,
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit's
rule,
its
substantive
constitutional
rule,
was
erroneous.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
to
find
out
whether?
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
you
know,
i
don't
know
that
they
ever
actually
made
a...
a
determination
other
than
that
mr.
romero
was
not
on
the
premises.
i
think
they
figured
that
out
once
they
had
actually
identified
each
of
the
individuals,
which
was
fairly
early
on
in
the
detention.
