justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
how--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
do
we
do
it?
it
goes
right
to
the
heart
of
this
from
you,
the
qualified
immunity
thing,
for
the
reason
that
if
you
look
at
the
facts
and
circumstances,
it
sounds
to
me
like
a
somewhat
close
question
as
to
whether
the
police
did
or
did
not
exceed
the
reasonable
bounds...
reasonable
bounds.
now,
if
it's
a
close
question,
you
have
a
jury
verdict
against
you,
and...
and
then
i
think,
well,
yes,
but
i
begin
to
come...
become
disturbed
if
i
think
of
qualified
immunity.
i
mean,
it
isn't
that
clear.
so...
so
having
read
through
the
thing,
i...
i
preliminarily
start
by
thinking,
well,
it
could
have
been
excessive
force,
i
mean,
given...
you
know,
i'm
using
that
in
quotes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
jury
said
it
was.
who
am
i
to
say
it
wasn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
that
situation?
but
qualified
immunity.
so
now,
what
do
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
a
lot
of
it
may
depend
on
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
the
music
as
to
handcuffing
and
what
did
they
say
and
what
was
the
atmosphere
and
what
was
the
garage
really
like
and
how
risky
was
it
that
there
be
gang
members
in
the
outhouses
and...
and
all
kinds
of
stuff
that
you
might
sense
from
the
testimony.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
would
you
be
happy
then
with
a
holding
that
says
just
what
you
said?
we
reaffirm
summers
and...
but
summers
said
special
circumstances
or
possibly
a
prolonged
detention
might
lead
to
a
different
conclusion
in
an
unusual
case.
and
the
only
verdict
part
that
i
think
we're
concerned
with
here...
it
was
not
about
four
people.
it
was
one
person,
iris
mena,
and
in
respect
to
iris
mena,
the
jury
found
that
there
was
a
violation
of
her...
of
her
fourth
amendment
rights.
and
as
to
her,
you
could
have
found...
you
said...
i
don't
know
if
you
misspoke.
you
said
it
could
be
more
than
15
minutes.
in
looking
at
it,
i
was
certain
whether
they
kept
her
for
15
minutes
more
or
more
than
15
minutes
more,
maybe
up
to
an
hour
or
more
beyond
the
time
that
the
search
ended
and
kept
her
in
handcuffs,
both
after
the
time
they
had
secured
the
place
and
also
after
the
time
the
search
ended.
well,
that
would
seem
a
basis
for
the
jury's
verdict
and
consistent
with
summers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
might
be
able
to
keep
your
verdict,
i...
i
think.
but
i
think
the
problem
here
is
the
ninth
circuit...
you
go
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
you
say,
you
know,
there
was
excessive
force
here
on
anybody's
definition
for
reasons
that
you
say.
and...
and
the
ninth
circuit
says,
oh,
it
was
a
clear
violation
of
the
constitution
and
we'll
tell
you
why,
and
then
they
give
some
reasons.
and
two
of
those
reasons
are,
a,
four
and
a
half
pages
written
the
reason
that
this
was
unconstitutional
is
because
they
asked
her
questions
about
immigration
status,
which
you...
i
don't
think
you
even
raised.
maybe
you
did.
but
anyway,
that's...
that's
the
bulk
of
the...
of...
of...
that's
the
bulk
of
the
analysis.
and...
and
these
are
the
words
that
i
think
they're
objecting
to.
and
by
any
standard
of
reasonableness,
mena
was...
the...
the
officers
should
have
released
her
from
the
handcuffs
when
it
became
clear
that
she
posed
no
immediate
threat.
and
that
was
long
before
the...
the...
because
she
wasn't
a
threat.
and
that
was
long
before
the
end
of
the
search.
and
what
their
point
is
on
that
is,
you
know,
if
that's
the
rule,
that's
going
to
interfere
with
our
swat
teams
because
they
can't
operate
that
way.
they...
they
can't
evaluate
the
individual.
they
put
the
individual...
if
there
are
guns
and
gangs
and
danger
that
she'll
grab
a
gun,
they
put
her
in
handcuffs,
and
they
hold
her
there
for
the
search
for
a
couple
of
hours,
then
they
release
her.
now,
that's
their
argument.
so
they're
objecting
not
so
much
to...
to
the
fact
they
have
to
pay
$30,000...
or
they
may
object
to
that.
but
they're...
they're
objecting
to
the
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
if
they're
right
on
that,
then
i
guess
we
have
to
send
it
back
and
say,
do
this
over
again,
though
i'll
be
sorry
about
that
and
maybe
there
is
a
way
not
to
do
it.
but...
but
i
want
to
know
your
view
of
what
i
see
as
those
two
issues
here,
that
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis
was
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
then
we
can't
really
reach
the
issue.
that's
a
possibility.
i
see
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
then
suppose
that
the
reason
that
this
case
is
here
is
because
of
the
implications--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--not
necessarily
the
extra
30
minutes
because
i
see
your
point
on
the
extra
30
minutes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we
could
say
is
their
opinion...
that's
their
opinion.
it's
beside
the
point,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true.
it
isn't
routine
in...
i
mean,
here
what
sort
of
pushes
the
other
way
on
this
is
this
is
a
dangerous
gang.
they
have
lots
of
weapons
and
they
have
previously
gone
to
this
house,
which
i
gather...
sometimes
when
i
read
it,
i
think
it's
like
a
warren
of
little
rooms.
on
the
other
hand,
maybe
it
isn't.
i
haven't
seen
the
house.
there
are
a
lot
of
buildings
around,
and
they
think
a
lot
of
people
here...
we
don't
know
who's
what,
and
we
make
a
mistake
in
this
and
we're
dead.
you
know,
i
mean,
so
that's
painting
it
the
other
way.
but
where
you
have
guns
and...
and
houses
and
gangs
and
so
forth,
now
that's
why
they
say
that
it's
reasonable
in
those
circumstances
to
say,
when
we
find
someone
in
the
house,
we
handcuff
them
through
the
search.
we
might
let
them
go
earlier,
but
that's
up
to
us
and
we
don't
want
the
courts
second
guessing
us
on
that.
now,
what's...
i'm
painting
it
their
way,
and
i'd
like
you
to
respond.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
they
search
that
room?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
do
we
have
the
tape
here?
