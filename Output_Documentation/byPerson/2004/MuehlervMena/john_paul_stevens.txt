justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
now
hear
argument
in
the
case
of
muehler
against
mena.
mr.
phillips.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
there
a
fact
issue
as
to
whether
she
was
handcuffed
for...
even
for
a
short
period
after
the
search
had
been
completed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if...
but
if
it
made
a
difference
as
a
matter
of
law,
what...
what
should
we
assume
about
that
extra
15
minutes?
do
we
assume
that
they
found
the
facts
in
the
way
that
the...
a
plaintiff
argues
them
or
that
you
think
they
are?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr....
mr....
but
may
i
point
out
that
the
judge's
instructions
did
put
that
issue
to
the
jury
at
page
203.
a
police
officer
is
required
to
release
an
individual
detained
in
connection
with
a
lawful
search
as
soon
as
the
officer's
right
to
conduct
the
search
ends
or
the
search
itself
is
concluded,
whichever
is
sooner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
why
the
judge
gave
this
instruction
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
might
save
your
time.
yes.
mr.
shanmugam.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
may
i
just
ask
a
sort
of
very
basic
question?
one
of
the
instructions
reads,
a
detention
may
be
unreasonable
if
it...
if
it
is
unnecessarily
painful,
degrading,
prolonged,
or
if
it
involves
an
undue
invasion
of
privacy.
now,
are
you
telling
us
that
you
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
a
question
of
law
that
the
judge
should
provide
rather
than
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
think
was
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it's
not
a
question
of
law.
the
answer
to
whether
it
was
unnecessarily
painful,
degrading,
prolonged,
or
involved
undue
invasion
of
privacy,
is
that
a
question
of
law
or
a
question
of
fact
to
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
mixed
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
the
historical
fact,
but
i'm...
i'm
questioning
you
about
the
conclusions
that
you
draw
from
the
unreasonableness,
degrading,
and
so
forth.
is
that
partly
to
be
decided
by
the
jury
or
entirely
by
the
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
instruction
should
not
have
been
given.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
long
did
it
take
them
to
find
out
whether
the...
these
other
dangerous
people
were
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
the
people
they
were
afraid
of
were...
were
on
the
premises?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
mr.
hoffman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
hoffman.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
about
3
and
a
half
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
