justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
a
quick
question?
the...
there
are
three
things.
were...
were
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
that's
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
problem
because
here
we're
dealing
with
the
fee
to
be
paid
by
the
people
who
are
plated
in
michigan,
and
it
looks
like
that
$100
is
the
fee
for
them.
well,
let
me...
i
have
a
question.
i'm
trying
to
test
this.
suppose
that
i
have
a
company
in
maine.
all
right?
and
i
have...
i
decide
all
my...
i...
i
have
all
maine
plates,
by
the
way.
and
i
decide
i
want
my...
now,
let's...
one
word
is
license
plates.
i'm
going
to
talk
about
plating.
another
word
is
the
icc
insurance.
let's
call
it
a
decal.
and
the
third
kind
of
a
concept
is
whatever
you
refer
to
in
your
statute
by
a
fee.
the
$100.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
suppose
in
maine
what
i
do
with
my
trucks
is
i
say
i
want
michigan
to
be
my
home
state
for
purposes
of...
what
do
you
call
it?
the
ss?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
and
so
i
go
to
michigan,
and
now
i
pay
all
the
registration
fees
here.
do
i
get
a...
a
certificate
of
some
kind,
a
decal
or
something
to
show
i
did
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
so...
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
i
get
a
decal
after
i
go
through
all
this
procedure?
you
have
a
whole
form.
i
pay
$6
for
alabama.
i
pay
$2
for
idaho,
and...
but...
but
i
do
it
all
in
one
shopping
place
which
happens
to
be
michigan.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
do
i
get
a
little
certificate
to
put
on
the
truck
to
say
i
did
it.
i...
i
registered
my
icc
decal
everywhere.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it's
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
for
michigan.
but
i
have
to
pay.
but
michigan
is
my...
i
can't
ask
the
question
until
i
get
clear
on
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't...
when
i...
when
i
go
under
this...
this
49
u.s.c.
14504
and
i
choose
a
home
state--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
make
all
the
relevant
payments
to
that
state,
but
they
distribute,
don't
i
get
a
piece
of
paper
saying
i
did
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
now,
i'm
now
plated
in
michigan,
and
i
make
michigan
my
home
state
for
this.
and
i
go
and
i
make...
i
say,
michigan,
i'm
going
to
give
you
this
big
check
to
distribute,
but
the
amount
i'm
putting
here
for
michigan,
by
the
way,
is
zero.
and
you
say
pay
me
$100.
no.
i'm
not
going
to
do
it.
so
i
haven't
paid
them
the
$100.
i
haven't
paid
michigan
everything,
but
i
paid
$2
for
idaho.
do
i
get
the
decal
or
don't
i?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
excellent.
now,
if
i
don't
get
the
decal,
because
i
didn't
pay
the
$100,
then
that
$100
is
a
charge
that
falls
within
the
ssi.
it
is
a
charge
for
a
decal
which
shows
that
i
registered
the
icc
and
my
insurance
because
otherwise,
if
it
weren't,
you'd
give
me
the
decal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
talking
about
a
fee.
i'm
trying
to...
oh,
fine.
if
there's
no
fee
charged
and
i
didn't
pay
the
$100
and
i
didn't
pay
anything
else,
you'd
give
me
the
decal.
but
you
said
you
wouldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
here
mini
treat
as
michigan
trucking
regulation.
the
first
case
is
american
trucking
association
against
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
it
involves
a
$100
fee
that
michigan
imposes
on
trucks
that
engage
in
local
business,
intrastate
business,
and
you
have
to
pay
it
whether
you
are
entirely
in
local
business
or
say,
you
are
in
interstate
truck
that
travels
across
the
nation
that
you
want
to
do
a
little
local
business
on
the
side.
so,
the
latter
interstate
group
say,
this
is
not
very
fair,
if
we
just
do
a
little
bit
of
business
in
michigan,
we
pay
a
$100
and
the
people
who
do
it
all
the
time,
pay
a
$100.
so,
really
per
load
or
per
truck
or
per
mile,
they
are
paying
a
lot
less,
and
that
violates
the
constitution’s
commerce
clause.
well,
we
don’t
think
it
does
violate
the
commerce
clause.
commerce
clause
says
that
commercial
speaking,
“all
the
members
of
the
entire
united
states
have
to
sink
or
swim
together”,
and
it
imposes
a
requirement
called
the
dormant
commerce
clause
that
forbids
states
to
discriminate
against
out
of
state
commercial
enterprises
or
out
of
state
commerce
that
crosses
the
border,
but
we
don’t
find
any
such
discrimination
here.
on
the
face
of
the
statute
it
makes
no
instate,
out
of
state
distinction,
everybody
pays
a
$100.
it
applies
only
to
instate
domestic
transactions
that’s
what
it's
about.
it's
neutral,
locally
focused,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
serious
discriminatory
harm
in
practice.
there
is
nothing
here
that
shows
it
significantly
deters
or
distorts
interstate
trade.
the
record
suggest
that
the
$100
amounts
to
a
reasonably
fair
share
of
the
regulatory
cost
like,
inspecting
a
truck
that
the
$100
goes
to
defray
and
it
is
obviously
far
simpler
to
administer
a
flat
tax
and
it
is
to
have
some
complicated
per
mile
tax.
at
least
the
record
does
not
show
to
the
contrary.
so,
it
does
not
place
a
financial
barrier
around
the
state.
language
that
comes
from
american
trucking
association
versus
scheiner,
a
case
on
which
the
truckers
heavily
rely,
we
distinguish
that
case,
the
reasons
i
have
summarized
and
others
we
find
no
commerce
clause
violation
and
we
affirm
a
similar
determination
by
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
have
each
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
