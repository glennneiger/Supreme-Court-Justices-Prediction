justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it...
it
does
for
trucks
that
want
to
deliver
things
within
the
state
of
michigan.
it
doesn't
for
anybody
else.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
have
that...
it
certainly
has
that
tendency.
do
we
have...
do
we
know
in
fact
what
the
effect
is?
is
it
deterring
anybody?
how
many
trucks
does
it
affect?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
so
much
that
you
necessarily
can
do
it,
but
it...
it
sort
of
interrupts
the...
the
kind
of
the
a
priori
reasoning
and
you're
thrown
back
on
a...
on...
on
a
practical
effects
analysis
under
pike.
justice
david
h.
souter
do...
do
i
understand
that
the
two
distinctions
in
what
is
done
with
the...
or
the
way
the
fee
is
collected
and
what's
done
with
it
is
that
the...
the
fee
is
charged
against
the...
is
it
the
operator
as
opposed
to
the
owner,
if
there
is
a
distinction?
is...
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
carrier.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
term
i
should
use.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
may
not
be
the
owner.
and
number
two,
as
i
understand
it,
as
distinct
from
the
registration
fee,
this
fee
goes
to
a
different
state
department.
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
let...
that's...
that's
a
premise
for
a
question
i
want
to
ask
you,
and
the
question
is
in
economic
effect,
is
there
any
difference
really
between
charging
this
$100
fee
with
those
differences
from
the
registration
fee
and
simply
jacking
up
the
registration
fee
by
$100?
would
there...
would
there
be
any
economic
difference
to
the...
to
the
public
or...
or
indeed
even
to
the
carriers
if
they
simply
jacked
up
the...
the
registration
fee
by
$100?
because
the...
the
registration
fee
is
passed
on
to
the
carrier,
if
it's
not
the
owner,
and
the
carrier...
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
carrier
whether
the...
whether
the
state
diverts
the
$100
up
front
or...
or
divides
the...
the
registration
fee
after
it's
paid.
so
is
there
any
economic
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that...
that...
maybe
i
don't
understand.
that...
that
tells
us
what
happens
to
the
money
after
it's
paid,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
person
who
is
paying
the
money,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
except
that
he
only
has
to
pay
in
one
place,
and...
and
if
they--
justice
david
h.
souter
--increase
the
registration
fee,
he'd
only
have
to
pay
in
one
place,
once.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
it...
so...
so
regardless
of
what
michigan
does
with
the
apportioned
amounts,
the
amount
it
charges
to
the...
to
the
owner,
in
the
case
of
the...
the
plating
fee,
is...
is
simply
set
by
the
state
of
michigan.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
what...
and...
and
the...
the
virtue
of
the
apportionment
is
that
the...
that
the
owner
or
the...
or
the
owner,
i
guess
in
this
case,
does
not
have
to
pay
fees
in
49
other
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
doesn't...
it
doesn't
matter
to...
that's
the
value
to
him.
it
doesn't
matter
to
him
how
they
apportion
whatever
that
fee
is
that
michigan
charges.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
who...
i
mean,
is...
that's...
that's
fine
as
a
matter
of
administration,
but
in
terms
of
the...
the
end
effect
on
the
person
who
has
to
pay
it
and
on
the
consumers
to
whom
it
is
ultimately
passed
on,
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
what
if
he
said
$20
instead
of
$10?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
what...
what
if
the
state
says,
you
can
enter...
enter
into
interstate
activities
for
nothing?
we're
simply
going
to
increase
the
registration
fee
by
$100.
couldn't
the
state
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
this
is
pure
formalism.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
computation
is
vehicle-specific,
but
you're
using
all
the
vehicles
as
hostage
for
the
payment
of...
of
any
shortfall.
that's
what
you're
doing,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
anyone
can
choose
to
do
that?
i
mean,
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
example,
anybody
can
say,
well,
i
think
i'd
like
to
be
plated
in
michigan
even
though
i
operate
in...
in
other
states.
my
principal
place
of
business
is
in
another
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i'm
just
asking
about
what
you
do
in
michigan.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
really
can
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
can
plate
your
whole
fleet
in
michigan
under
those
circumstances.
