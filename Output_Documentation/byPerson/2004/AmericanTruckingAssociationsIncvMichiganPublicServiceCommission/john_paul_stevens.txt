justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask
this
question?
suppose
you
have
an
interstate
carrier
that
does
100,000
miles
of
business
in
michigan
and
you
have
an
intrastate
carrier
that
does
a
100,000
miles
of
business
in
michigan.
they
both
say
the...
pay
the
same
tax,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would
both
pay
the
same
tax,
both
the
intra
and
the
interstate.
now,
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
discrimination
against
either
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
just
saying
if
the
intrastate
and
interstate
carriers
both
have
the
same
intrastate
mileage,
they
both
pay
the
same
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
might
have
an
intrastate
carrier
that
does
a
smaller
amount
of
mileage,
only
50,000
miles,
and
an
interstate
carrier
that
pays...
does
100,000
miles.
they
both
pay
the
same
tax
too.
and
everybody
is
treated
alike
on
their
intrastate
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
tax
only
operates
on
intrastate
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
supposing
the...
michigan
changed
its
system
and
said
we're
going
to
charge
you
$90
for...
as
a
plating
fee.
we're
only
talking
about
vehicles
that
are
plated
in
michigan.
we're
going
to
charge
you
$90
for
a
plating
fee
and
now
we're
going
to
take
10...
what
used
to
part
of
the
$100
and
another
$10
registration
fee.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
is
the
fee
payable
before
the...
a
carrier
may
engage
in
business
or
is
it
after
the
carrier
has
paid?
is
it...
is
it
like
a
tax
that's
paid
after
the
year
is
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
had
to
pay
it
before,
there
would
be
no
way
to
calculate
it
ahead
of
time
because
nobody
would
have
had
any
mileage.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
have
to
pay
it
before
the
year
begins
and
before
you're
allowed
to
engage
in
the
business,
you
would
have
no
way
of
measuring
the
number
of
miles
you're
going
to
travel
during
the...
the
ensuing
year.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
boynton,
may
i
just...
may
i
just
ask
this
question?
is
part
of
your
position
that
the
federal
statute
does
not
prevent
michigan
from
waiving
the
$10
fee
on...
for
this
particular
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
so
that...
but
you're
saying
to
justice
breyer
then
is
they
have
waived
the
$10
and
they
do
it
to
a
narrow
class,
those
vehicles
who
are
plated
in
michigan
because
they've
already
charged
them
$100,
a
very
heavy
charge
for
the
privilege
of
being
plated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
because
i
know
your
time
is
short.
supposing
michigan
imposed
a
new
$10
fee
per...
and
it
identified
it
precisely
as
in
order
to
comply
with
that
statute
and
then
reduced
its
present
plating
fee
from
$100
to
$90,
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
saying...
they
reduced
to
$90
the
plating
fee,
but
then
they
enacted
a
new
$10
fee
specifically
designed
to
comply
with
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
$90
is
for
plating.
it
said
only...
only
michigan-plated
vehicles
pay
the
$90.
everybody
else...
everybody...
and
everybody
also
pays
the
$10.
