mr.
digges,
this...
the...
the...
there
was
a
question
about
the
ramifications
of
the
position
that
you're
presenting.
that
is,
there
are
many
situations
in
which
there
is
some
kind
of
licensing
fee
that
is
imposed
on
everyone,
the
same
dollar
amount,
although
some
people
who
are
licensed
will
be
doing
because
in
other
states
and
have
to
get
licenses
there
as
well.
the
example
that
was
featured
in
the...
in
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
of
the
lawyer
who
is
licensed,
say,
in
massachusetts
and
also
in
d.c.
does
not
get
any
break
on
his
d.c.
bar
admission
because
he
is
also
admitted
in
massachusetts,
and
in
fact,
does
most
of
his
practice
out-of-state,
out
of
the
district.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
scheiner
case
didn't
make
a
distinction
based
on
in-state
activity.
i
thought
that
that...
that
flat
fee
was
applicable
to
every
motor
carrier
that
went
on
the
roads
in
pennsylvania.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who...
who
sets
the
fee
for
the
plating?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
could
have...
unlike
the...
the
fee,
the
$10
fee,
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
federal
cap,
this
would...
for
plating
it
could
be
anything
each
individual
state
chooses
it
to
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how...
how
does
that
work
in...
in
practice?
is
it
easily
accessible?
suppose
the
company--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--wants
to
fill
up
its
truck
and...
and
it
said,
well,
this
is
going
to
be...
the
only
haul
this
season
for
me,
so
i
want
the
3-day
permit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this...
this
applies
only
to
operations
that
are
both
licensed
and
registered
in
michigan.
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right,
right,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
place
any
reliance
in
this
scheme
on
the
fact
that
the
only
people
subject
to
it
are
people
who
have
their
principal
place
of
business
in
michigan?
