mr.
henry
j.
boynton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner,
american
trucking,
began
its
reply
brief
with
the
claim
that
the
central
reality
in
this
case
is
that
the
michigan
intrastate
fee
places
significant
burdens
on
interstate
commerce.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
rejected
this
claim
squarely,
saying
that
as
a
matter
of...
that
that
was
a
matter
of
pure
speculation.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
before
this
court
that
the
trucking
companies'route
choices
are
affected
by
the
intrastate
fee.
furthermore,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
intrastate
fee
keeps
anyone
out
from
engaging
in
intrastate
trucking
in
michigan.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
well,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
very
well
may
be
the
case,
but
they
pointed
to
the
fact
that
there
were
no
facts
to
support
that
finding.
and
this
is
completely
different
than
in
scheiner.
in
scheiner
you
had
a...
a
trial,
you
had
evidence
before
the
court.
this
court
noted
that
the...
the
cost
to
an
interstate
trucker
in
that
situation
was
five
times
greater
than
the
cost
to
a
trucker
that
was
in
pennsylvania.
you
just
simply
don't
have
those
facts
here.
what
you
have
is
a
discrete
or
a
distinct
local
activity
that
is
something
that
doesn't
affect
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
that's
right.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
well,
justice
scalia,
that
very
well
may
be
true,
but
we
don't
have
any
way
of...
of
qualifying
or
quantifying
the
burden
here
because
we
don't
have
those
facts.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
think
it
is
very
difficult
to
do
that.
as
the
united
states
noted
in
its
brief,
they
didn't
think
that
mileage
would
be
appropriate
because
this...
this
fee
doesn't
support
the
maintenance
of
the
highways.
what
this
fee
does
is
allows
trucking
companies
or
allows
that
truck
to
operate
that
truck
in
intrastate
business.
so
mileage
isn't
appropriate.
our
position
is
that
mileage
isn't
appropriate
because
it's
next
to
impossible
to
try
and
figure
out.
what
do
you
compare
it
to?
do
you...
do
you
compare
it
to
interstate
miles?
do
you
compare
it
to
a
ratio
of
interstate...
intrastate
to
interstate?
and
if
you
do
that,
how...
how
can
you
come
up
with
a
accurate
picture
of,
you
know,
what
the
value
of
that
license
is
in
michigan?
it
may
be--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--well,
your
honor,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
had
taken
the
position
that
this
was
a
fee,
not
a
tax,
and
under
a
fee...
if...
if
a
fee
was
$10,000,
if
the
expenses
matched
the...
the
revenue
from
it,
well,
then
it...
it
would
be
a...
could
be
sustained
as
a
fee.
now,
if
were
a
tax--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--your
honor,
we
think
that
the...
if
it's
a
fee
and
not
a
tax,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
applied
the
correct
standard,
and
that
was
the
standard
of
pike
v.
bruce
church.
and
you
would
look
to
the...
whether
the
statute
regulated
even-handedly,
whether
it
affected
a
legitimate
local--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--i
think
that...
that
that
was
what
the
michigan
court
of
appeals--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--yes,
and
i...
i
think
that's
a--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--i
think
that's
an
appropriate
manner
in
dealing
with
it.
but
if
you...
if
you
look
at
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
opinion--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--well,
first
of
all,
it
provided
a
direct
benefit
to
the
intrastate
truckers.
they
were
able
to
operate
in
the
state
of
michigan.
second
of
all,
they
pointed
out
that
it
was
in
relation
to
the
services
granted,
being
able
to
do
that,
and
then
the
third
component
would
be
the
voluntariness,
whether
they
could
agree
to...
they
didn't
have
to
engage
in
intrastate
trucking--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--well,
i
think
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
opinion,
it...
it
was
a
fee,
and
i
think...
i
think
what
we
come
back
to,
your
honor,
is
the
idea
is
there
a
specific
class
of
individuals
or
businesses
that
are
benefitted.
and
i
think
that
that's
the
distinction
between
a
fee
and
tax.
also,
a
tax
is
a
general
revenue-raising
measure,
whereas
a
fee
is
not.
and
that's
another
distinction
of...
of
a
tax.
and
indeed,
this
court...
in
national
cable
industry
v.
the
united
states,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
this
court
said
as
whether
an
exaction
is
a
tax
or
a
fee
depends
on
whether
its
purpose
is
to
raise
revenue
or
regulate
an
industry
or
services.
one
of
the
things--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
well--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--well,
i...
i...
maybe
i
misspoke
myself.
what
i
really
meant
to
say
was
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
do.
and
in
our
joint
appendix...
in
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
you
got
to
look
at
what's
the
total
cost
here.
the
cost
is
not
only
to
the
administrative
aspect
by
the
state,
but
this
imposes
another
cost
on
the
truckers.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
but,
your
honor,
the
problem
is--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--your
honor,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
this
fee,
this
intrastate
fee,
does
not
go
to
maintain
the
highways
as
it
was
in
scheiner.
they
make
the
argument
that
it's
very
easy
that
the
mechanism...
they,
being
american
trucking,
makes
the
argument
that
it's
very
easy
to
just
start
logging
up
the
miles
and...
and
you
have
the
mechanism
there.
but
the
difference
between
scheiner
and
this
case
is
that
in
scheiner
you
were
measuring
all
intrastate
miles,
any
miles
traveled
within
that
state.
and
there's
a
mechanism
available
administratively
to
do
that.
the
irp
requires
that.
but
here
you're
not
logging
all
intrastate
miles.
you're
only
logging
those
miles
in
the
state
that
involve
a
point-to-point
delivery,
from
one
intrastate
point
to
another.
so
you
don't...
you'd
have
to
get
a
whole
new
record
keeping
or
you'd
have
to
keep
track
of
a
while
different
set
of
miles
than
you
would
with
respect
to
the
irp.
and
that's
the
thing
that
i
find
striking
about
this,
that
the
american
trucking
association
is
basically
saying
to
its
members
that
they
want
to
have
them
do
more
record
keeping
on
their
part.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
well,
that
may
be,
your
honor,
but
the...
the
point
is...
what
we're
dealing
with
is
a...
a
fee
that
has
revenues
of
about
$3
million.
and
if
you
have
additional
record
keeping,
how
much
of
that
$3
million
is
going
to
have
to
be
devoted
to
paying
for
the
administrative
costs
that
are
involved?
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
it's
paid
before.
they...
they
have
to
have--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
that's
correct.
you
would
have
to
have--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--now,
you're
talking
about
the
interstate
fee,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
well,
it...
let
me
back
up.
the
reason
i
asked
with
you...
when
you
were
referring
to
the
$10
fee
is
because
the
intrastate
fee...
we
have
a
$10
component
in
that
as
well.
you
can
obtain
a
temporary
fee
for
$10
for
72
hours
to
conduct
an
intrastate
operation.
so
the
statute
in...
structurally
has
some
apportionment
factor
in
it.
so
you
don't
have
to
necessarily
buy
the
$100
intrastate
fee
decal
to
conduct
intrastate
operations.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
i
suppose
that
would
be
one
way--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--well--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--yes,
your
honor,
you
can
obtain
the
permits
in
advance.
you
don't
have
to
have
trucks
lined
up
at
the
border
waiting
to
get
a
decal
or
get
a
permit.
you
can
purchase
them
in
advance.
so
that...
that's
available
to
the
truckers.
the
one
thing
i
should
mention,
though,
is
you
have
to
have
one...
you
already
have
to
have
one
vehicle
licensed
intrastate.
you
already
have
to
have
paid
the
fee
on
one
vehicle,
and
then
you
would
be
eligible
to
purchase
additional
temporary
permits
as
the
need
arose
based
on
seasonal
needs
or
an
emergency
situation.
so
that...
that
allows
the...
the
statute...
i...
i
would
submit
to
your
honor,
allows
some
apportioning
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
no.
your
honor
i
think
is
referring
to
the
interstate
fee--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--which
is
a
different
fee,
which
is
in
the
mid-con
case.
our
position--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
i
was
going
to
do
that
right
now,
your
honor.
the
position
that
the
state
of
michigan
and
the
michigan
public
service
commission
has
is
the
ssrs
does
not
preempt
the
interstate
fee.
and
the
reason
for
that
is--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
you
have
to
realize
is
you
have...
when
you
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute,
i
think
what
is
very
clear
from
reading
the
text
is
that
the
ssrs
does
not
preempt
all
state
fees
and
charges
on
motor
carriers.
it
only
preempts
those
fees
and
charges
that
are
specifically
related
to
the
registration
of
that
motor
carrier's
interstate
authority.
the
interstate
fee,
or
the
michigan-plated
vehicle
fee
here,
is
not
preempted
because
it's
a
regulatory
fee
that
does
not
relate
to
the
registration
of
the
motor
carrier's
ssrs
interstate
authority.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
well--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
a
couple
things.
number
one,
i
think
that...
i
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
michigan
statute,
you'll
see
that
under
section
2,
which
contains
both
the
interstate
fee
and
the
intrastate
fee,
virtually
all
michigan
vehicles
that
are
plated
in
michigan...
#
the
effect
of
it
is
that
all
vehicles
that
are
plated
in
michigan
will
have
paid
this
$100
fee.
and
furthermore,
if
you
look
at
section
7
of
the
michigan
statute,
which
is
478.7,
that
involves
the
registration
procedure.
that's
specifically
applicable
to
the
registration
of
interstate
authority.
and
within
that
section
7,
subsection
(4)
deals
with
the
payment
of
the
$10
fee
for...
and...
and
it's
to
be
made
by
vehicles
that
are
not
plated
in
the
state
of
michigan.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
well,
that's
the
argument.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
right.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
ssrs.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
no.
your
honor,
i...
i...
you
say
that
you're
a
maine
company--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--but
your
principal
place
of
business
is
in
michigan?
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
okay.
and
your
question
is?
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
okay.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
if
that
vehicle...
if
the
vehicle
you're
registering
is
plated
in
michigan--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--okay.
you
will
pay
nothing.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
i'm
sorry.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
to
get
a
decal
from
michigan,
you
have
to
be
michigan-plated
and
you
have
to
pay
the
$100.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
your
honor,
we
believe
that
under
the...
the
section
7
of
the
michigan
law,
there
is
no
fee
charged
for
your
ssrs.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
your
honor,
you
have
to...
you
have
to...
if
it's
michigan-plated,
that's
the
triggering
mechanism.
it's
not
the...
that's...
that's
what
triggers
the
$100
fee.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
our
position,
with
respect
to
that,
your
honor,
is
the
fact
that
under
section
7
of
the
michigan
motor
carrier
act,
478.7,
michigan
has
no
authority
to
charge
a
michigan-plated
vehicle
any
fee
at
all.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
well,
i
don't
know
if
i'm
saying
that,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
the...
there's
a
zero
charge,
and
then
there's...
there's
another
charge
with
respect
to
a
vehicle
fee.
the
one
thing
that
i
need
to
point
out
here
is
that
the
ssrs
is
not
vehicle-specific.
it
talks
about
numbers
of
vehicles,
but
the
michigan
decal
fee
for...
or
the
interstate
fee
is
vehicle-specific.
you
have
to
identify
the
particular--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--interstate
commerce.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
and
how
do
you
want
to
use
the
truck?
do
you
want
to
use
it
in
interstate
commerce?
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
yes,
it
is.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
oh.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
well,
i
think
administratively
that...
that
wouldn't
happen.
i...
i
think
once
you
go--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--i
suppose
that
if
the...
for...
for
nonpayment
of
fees,
a
motor
carrier
risks
its
authority
to
operate
in
the
state.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
well,
i...
i
think
it
is.
i
would
disagree
with
your
honor.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
well,
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
your
honor
respectfully.
i
think
that
the...
that
it
is
vehicle-specific
because
it
identifies
the
particular
vehicle
that's
involved
here.
and
i...
i
think
you
have
to
read
the
statute,
the
preemption
statute,
the
scope
of
what
preemption
has
sought
to
do
here,
and
not
all
state
fees
and
charges
on
motor
carrier
vehicles
are
preempted.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
no,
your
honor.
the
triggering
event
for
the
interstate
fee
is
the
plating
of
the
vehicle
in
michigan.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
right.
i
think
all
parties
have
noted,
your
honor,
that
the...
under
the
ssrs
it's
much
more
stringent,
more
rigorous--
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
--yes.
yes,
you
can.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
you
can
plate
wherever
you
have
contacts
with
the
state.
if
your
principal
place
of
business
is
in
ohio
but
you
have
trucks
going
to
and
from
michigan,
that...
that
would
allow
you
to
plate
in
state
of
michigan.
mr.
henry
j.
boynton
you
could...
you
can
choose
where
to
plate
your
feet...
plate
your
trucks,
and
a
number
of
considerations
go
into
that.
it's
not
just
the
license
plating
fees.
it
has
everything
to
do...
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
it
could
have
to
do
with
no
fault
insurance,
the
weight
limits
on
trucks.
it's
an
economic
decision
and
there's
a
number
of
different
factors
that
go
into
that
decision
of
where
to
plate
a
vehicle.
in
conclusion,
i
would
say
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
correctly
decided
this
case.
and
they...
they
found
that
the
challenged
fees
in
these
cases
are
regulatory
fees,
that
they
serve
the
critical
function
of
protecting
the
people
of
michigan
that
use
the
highways.
and
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
