justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
fee
applies
to
all
michigan-plated
vehicles.
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'd
like
to
get
back
just
for
a
moment--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
the
answer
you
gave
about
apportionment
because
i
wasn't
quite
sure
i
understood
the
answer.
you
said,
well,
apportionment
is
very
difficult.
what
are
you
supposed
to
do?
what
are
you...
what's
the
base?
well,
and
you
said,
should
we
apportion
against...
between
in-state
and
out-of-state,
and
i
would
think
the
answer
is
yes.
that's
the
whole
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
we're
talking
about
mileage
here,
maybe
this
is
something
that's
eminently
susceptible
of
apportionment.
now,
it
may
be
that
administratively
this
is
just
too
expensive.
that
may
be...
that
may
be
a
very
valid
argument.
but
so
far
as
saying
that
there's
no
basis
for
apportionment,
i
didn't
understand
your
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
be
difficult
to
do
administratively.
but...
just
because
of
the
cost
of
collecting
all
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that...
that...
i
agree
that
that
is
expensive.
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
easier
to
do
it
with
trucks
which
have
miles
than
with--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--than
with,
say,
attorneys
or
accountants
or
whatever.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
it...
it
does.
number
one,
it's
somewhat
suspect
at
the
outset
because
it
applies
only
to
interstate
travel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
then
the...
the
other
vehicles
pay
$100
for
the...
for
the
in-state
fees,
and
so
this
seems
to
me
that...
that
on...
on
its
face
shows
that
it's
like
a
registration
fee.
