mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
supports
the
state
in
american
trucking
and
the
petitioner
in
mid-con.
with
respect
to
american
trucking,
in
our
view
the
central
question
in
resolving
the
constitutional
issue
is
not
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
apportion
the
intrastate
fee
on
a
more
precise
basis.
the
question
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
it.
and
in
the
prior
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
both
the
older
cases
dealing
specifically
with
intrastate
transportation
and
the
more
recent
cases
dealing
with
authority
to
engage
in
other
intrastate
businesses,
this
court
has
repeatedly
upheld
the
authority
of
states
and
municipalities
to
charge
flat
fees
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
the
local
business
within
the
jurisdiction
during
the...
the
relevant
period
of
time.
and
that
practice--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
with...
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
has
certainly
abandoned
the
notion
that
there
is
a
bright,
absolute
line
between
intrastate
activities
which
are
subject
to
plenary
regulation
by
the
states
without
any
commerce
clause
inquiry
and
interstate
commerce
which
is
wholly
immune
from
state
regulation.
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
question
is
more
complicated
than
that.
but
in
cases
like
jefferson
lines,
for
instance,
the
court
held
that
the
sales
price
of
a
ticket
for
an
interstate
bus
trip
could
be
taxed
in...
in
its
entirety
by
the
state
in
which
the
ticket
was
purchased
because
the
sale
of
the
ticket
was
regarded
as
a
separate,
discrete
event
properly
severable
from
the
underlying
interstate
transaction.
and
the
case
for
severance
is
all
the
more
powerful
here.
that
is,
here
we're
dealing
not
with
a...
an
aspect
of
an
interstate
transaction,
we're
dealing
with
point-to-point
hauls
within
the
state
of
michigan.
it's
true
that
those
may
be
undertaken
by
trucks
that
also
do
interstate
business,
and
it's
even
true
that
in
some
instances
the
intrastate
load
may
be
carried
on
the
same
truck
at
the
same
time
that
it's
also
carrying
goods
between
the
states.
but
the
intrastate
haul
is
itself
a
discrete
commercial
transaction.
to
the
shipper
it's
wholly
irrelevant,
in
most
instances,
that
the...
the
truck
is
also
doing
an
interstate
business.
and
to
differentiate
this
case
from
scheiner,
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
has
looked
at
in
the
dormant
commerce
clause
inquiry
is
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation.
and
the
court
doesn't
just
mean
multiple
taxation
in...
in
the
abstract
because
it's
necessarily
going
to
be
the
case
that
an
entity
that
does
business
in
many
states
will
be
taxed
in
many
states.
rather
the
question
is
whether
there's
an
undue
risk
of
multiple
taxation
on
the
same
transaction
or
the
same
conduct
or
the
same
activity.
and
that
was
at
real
risk
in
scheiner
because
if
you
imagine
a
truck
that's
delivering
cargo
from
maine
to
florida
and
passing
through
several
states
on
the
way,
and
it's
required
to
pay
a
fee
that
is,
in
essence,
a
fee
for
entering
the
state,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
mileage
traveled
within
the
jurisdiction,
it's
entirely
reasonable
to
say
that
the
imposition
of
those
cumulative
trips...
cumulative
taxes
for
a
single
haul
of
goods
from
maine
to
florida
is
an
instance
of
multiple
taxation
of
the
same
event.
here
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
that.
the
tax
is
being
levied
solely
on
point-to-point
hauls
within
the
state
of
michigan.
if
a
particular
truck
also
makes
point-to-point
hauls
in
some
other
state
within
the
calendar
year,
it
may
be
subject
to
two
taxes,
but
they
can't
be
characterized
as
two
taxes
on
the
same
conduct
or
the
same
transaction.
the
second
aspect
of...
of
scheiner--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think
you're
right
that
it
wouldn't
be
reasonable
to
regard
the
within-texas
segment
or
the
within-oklahoma
segment
of
a
transfer
of
goods
between
states
as
a
discrete,
separable
event.
but
if
the
truck
is
picking
up
goods
at
one
point
in
texas
and
depositing
them
at
another
point
in
texas,
again
from
the
shipper's
point
of
view,
that's
clearly
a
discrete
transaction.
the
shipper
is
unlikely
to
have
any
interest
in
whether
the
same
truck
is
simultaneously
carrying
goods
among
the
states.
and
it's
reasonable
to
regard
that
as
a
discrete
event
that
is
taxable
by
the
state
in
which
it
occurs.
the
other
point
to
make
about
scheiner
is
that
even
if
we
assume,
as
the
petitioner
argues,
that
the
average
interstate
truck
that
makes
some
point-to-point
hauls
within
michigan
will
do
so
less
frequently
than
the
average
truck
that
does
business
solely
within
that
state,
there's
still
a
whole
different
class
of
interstate
truckers
that
makes
substantial
use
of
michigan's
roads
that
could
be
charged
taxes
on
the
basis
of
mileage
traveled
and
they're
being
let
off
the
hook
because
the
state
has
chosen
to
focus
this
tax
on
intrastate
activity.
petitioners'response
to
this
is
that
you
can't
discriminate
against
one
class
and
then
make
up
for
it
by...
by
discriminating
in
favor
of
a
different
class.
and
if
this
were,
to
use
title
vii
terminology,
a
disparate
treatment
case,
we
would
agree.
that
is,
if
a
state
overtly
discriminates
against
one
class
of
interstate
or
out-of-state
activities
and
on
the
face
of
the
law
those
people
are
treated
less
favorably,
then
we
would
entirely
agree
that
the
state
couldn't
make
up
for
it
by
giving
more
favorable
treatment
to
a
different
class
of
out-of-state
entities.
but
here
the
petitioner
is
making
what
amounts
to
a
disparate
impact
claim,
and
the
essence
of
a
disparate
impact
claim
is
not
that
any
particular
individual
has
suffered
unfair
treatment.
the
way
you
prove
a
disparate
impact
claim
is
to
show
the
effect
cumulatively
upon
the
class,
upon
interstate
truckers
in
this
case
in
the
aggregate.
and
there's
really
no
way
to
feel
any
kind
of
confidence
that
interstate
truckers
won't
do
better
as
a
group
by
virtue
of
michigan's
decision
to
focus
this
tax
on
intrastate
activity
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
mileage,
which
would
sweep
in
a
lot
of
out-of-state
truckers
that
are
not
currently
covered.
i'd
like
to
speak
briefly
at
least
about
the...
the
mid-con
case.
and
in
our
view
the
best
way
of
understanding...
to...
to
return
to
the
historical
antecedents
of
the
current
ssrs
provision,
in
its
original
form,
as
enacted
in
1965,
the
statute
said
it's
not
an
unreasonable
burden
of...
on
interstate
commerce
to
require
an
interstate
carrier
to
register
its
federal
certificate
so
along
as
you
do
so
in
accordance
with
the
standards
of
the
icc.
if
you
go
beyond
those
standards,
it's
an
unreasonable
burden
on
commerce.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
was--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
text
of
the
current
statute
is
set
forth
at
page
82
of
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari
petition
in
mid-con,
and
it's
now
49
u.s.c.
14504(b).
and
the
statute
says,
the
first
sentence,
the
requirement
of
a
state
that
a
motor
carrier
providing
transportation
subject
to
jurisdiction
under
subchapter
1
of
chapter
135...
and
that
refers
to
interstate
transportation...
providing
interstate
transportation
and
providing
transportation
in
that
state
must
register
with
the
state
is
not
an
unreasonable
burden
on
transportation
referred
to
in
section
13501.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
13501
is
the
provision
that...
that
defines
the
general
regulatory
jurisdiction
of
the
department
of
transportation
and
the
surface
transportation
board.
and
it
basically
says
these
agencies
have
general
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
transportation
between
points
in
one
state
and
points
in
another
state
and...
or
between
points
in
the
same
state
passing
through
another
state.
so
in...
in
using
that
shorthand
reference,
the
congress
just
means
interstate
transportation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
as
long
as
the...
again,
to...
in
our
view
the
distinctive
and
disqualifying
feature
of
the
current
statute
is
that
subsection
(2)
is
imposed
specifically
on
vehicles
that
operate
entirely
in
interstate
commerce.
and
if
michigan
reduced
to
$90
the
extra--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--as
long
as--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--as
long
as
they
were
still
imposing
that
additional...
again--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--as
long
as
that
$90
fee
was
imposed
not
just
on
michigan-plated
vehicles
generally,
but
specifically
on
michigan-plated
vehicles
that
operate
entirely
in
interstate
commerce,
we
would
say
that's
preempted
because
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
basically
congress
has
said
there's
a
severe
limit
on
what
you
can
do
to
interstate
carriers
that
you
don't
do
to
intrastate
carriers.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
may
i
answer,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
state
doesn't
argue
that
this
registration
was
completed
in
accordance
with
this
standard.
it
argues
that
the
provision
doesn't
apply
at
all
because
this
is
not
the
sort
of
registration
requirement
that
the
statute
speaks
of.
we
think
it
is
because
it's
imposed
strictly
on
interstate
carriers.
