mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
challenge
to
michigan's
$100
per
truck
flat
annual
fee
that
is
imposed
on
all
trucks
that
are
registered
to
do
point-to-point
operations
in
the
state
of
michigan.
we
submit
that
this
fee,
this
flat
per
truck
fee,
has
the
same
impermissible
effects
on
interstate
commerce
as
the
two
flat
truck
fees
that
were
struck
down
by
this
court
in
american
trucking
associations
v.
scheiner.
in
the
american
trucking
associations
v.
scheiner
case,
this
court
looked
at
the
practical
effect
of
these
fees
and
found
that
because
of
their
unapportioned
structure,
that
the
fees
had
four
interrelated
types
of
impermissible
effects
on
interstate
commerce.
first,
the
court
found
that
these
kinds
of
flat
fees
were
a
financial
barrier
against
out-of-state
motor
carriers
even
coming
into
the
state
that
imposed
the...
the
fee.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
michigan
flat
fee
has
the
same
kind
of
protectionist
quality.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
yes,
it...
it
discriminates
and
it...
it
has
an
exclusory
effect
on
trucks...
out-of-state
carriers
that
want
to
compete
in
the...
and
bring
their
trucks
across
the...
the
border
of
michigan
and
compete
against
local
carriers
for
intrastate
hauls.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
there
was
not
a
trial
below.
so
we
don't
have
that
fact.
we
believe
that
as
in
the
scheiner
case,
these...
these
tendencies
are
inherent
there.
because
of
the
structure
of
the
fee,
it
not
only
has
this
effect,
it
has
what
this
court
called
a
hydraulic
pressure
effect,
and
that
is
to...
for
carriers,
once
they
have
paid
this
fee
as
an
entrance
fee,
to
pull
their
trucks
out
of
interstate
commerce
and
to
concentrate
them
into...
in
the
state
of
michigan
in
the
local
activities.
and
that...
in
fact,
the
state
acknowledges
that.
below,
the
state
said
that
motor
carriers
should
allocate
or
dedicate
their
trucks
to
the
state
of
michigan
in
order
to
avoid
these
consequences.
and
even
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
recognized
that,
saying
a
local
carrier
would
be
discouraged
from
operating
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what...
what
that's
saying...
and
i
know
that
was
the
argument
made
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief...
is
that
you
can
discriminate
against
one
component
of
interstate
commerce,
those
carriers
that
want
to
actually
compete
and
do
intrastate
business
in
the
state,
as
long
as
you
give
a
benefit
to
another
component
of
interstate
commerce,
those
who
just
wish
to
operate
in
the...
in
the
state
of
michigan
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
what
happens
is
that...
that
there
are
the
segment
of
carriers
that
would
like
to
compete
against
intrastate
carriers.
the
fact
that
other
carriers
may
be
getting
a
break
in
terms
of
regulatory
fees...
and
we
don't
know
that
to
be
the
truth,
getting
the
other
interstate
carriers.
it's
the
boston
stock
exchange,
and
i
think
it
was
said
again
in
the
scheiner
case
that...
that
you
can't
discriminate
among
interstate
carriers.
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
you
could
set
up
a
situation
in
which
a...
a
state
discriminated
in
favor
of
interstate
carriers
in
situations
or
industries
where
their
locals
had
no
interest
in
competing,
but
where
their...
their
locals
were
interested
in
competing,
they
could
set
up
a
discriminatory
system.
so
you
can
protect
timber
industry
in...
in
oregon
and--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--if
they
each
do
100,000
miles
of
intrastate
business
in
michigan--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--they
would
pay
the
same
flat
fee.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
if...
if
this...
if
this
tax
was
apportioned
based
on
mileage,
it
would
not
be
discrimination,
but
unfortunately,
it
is
not
and--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--and
we...
we
would...
and
again,
if
this
was
a
mileage-apportioned
fee,
it
would
be...
it
would
be
fine.
but
the
fact
is
as
in
scheiner,
the
out-of-state
carriers,
because
the
interstate
carrier
is...
is
operating--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--that
would
be
true
but
that--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--the
factual
situation
is
going
to
be
that
the
interstate
carrier
is
just
not
going
to
have
the
opportunity
to
do
as
much
business
in
michigan
as
the
intrastate
carrier.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
it
does
strike
me
as
self-evident.
in
fact,
to
courts
below...
we
have...
we've
made
this
argument.
we've
seen
this
argument
now.
the
cases
have
called
it
intuitively
obvious.
and
from
the
discussion
of...
in
the
scheiner
case
and
from
the
discussion
in
the
nippert
case,
the
very
difference
between
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce
means
that
on
average
the
interstate
carrier
is
just
not
going
to
use
the
state's
facilities
as
much
as
the
in-state
carrier.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
i
don't
think
a
trial
is
necessary
because,
as
i
say,
this...
this
court
quoted
justice
frankfurter
clearly,
and
i
think
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
says
that
on
average
the
out-of-state
carrier
is
not
going
to
get
as
much
benefit
from
this
fee.
this
is
a
variable
cost
fee.
in
effect,
the
out-of-state
carrier
is
having
to
pay
more
than
its
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
the...
of
the
state's
regulatory
system.
and
again,
that's
something
that
was
accepted
in
the
scheiner
case,
accepted
in...
in
the
nippert
case.
and
the
intrastate
carrier...
every
time
that
it
operates
in
the
state,
it
is
using
that
privilege.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
i
think
the
nippert
case
was
from
the
1940's
i
believe.
in
any
event,
as
we've
been
discussing--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--it's--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
i
know
that...
that
example
was
given.
i
think
there
are
a
variety
of
flat
fees
that
would
be
unaffected
by
this.
there
are
fees
that
would
be
administrative
charges
and...
and
if
all
the
state
is
doing
is
charging,
for
example,
the
cost
of
a
background
investigation
or
the
cost
of
a
truck
inspection,
a
fixed
cost,
then
it's
fair
to
ask
the
carrier
to
pay
a
fixed
fee
or
to
ask
the
taxpayer
to
pay
a
fixed
fee.
with
respect
to
the
bar
fees,
they
are
obviously
different
than
the
trucking
industry
and...
and
the
taxation
of
an
instrumentality
in
interstate
commerce.
but
we
think
that
there
may
be
impracticalities
in
apportioning
a
bar
fee.
you
could
have
an
attorney
in
his
office
in
virginia
that
is
working
for
a
california
customer
or
california
client
that
is
being...
for
a
case
that
is
being
tried
in
the
court
system
of
oregon,
and
then
for
transaction
work,
he
could
be
working
for
a
customer
or
a
client
in...
in
missouri
for...
a
multi
state.
so
it
may
be
difficult
to
apportion
fees.
we
haven't
really
examined
that.
but
we
know
from
this
court's
decisions
that...
that
is
easy
and
can
be
apportioned
for
truck
fees,
and
truck
fees...
this
court
said
in
scheiner
that
the
technology
is
now
available
to
look
at
the
extent
of
the
activity
and
the
taxpayer
in...
in...
of
the
truck
in
the
state,
and
later
on
in
a
subsequent
decision
said
that
you
can
easily
track
large
physical
objects
over
states.
so
you
can
apportion
these
fees
on
trucks
to
their
mileage
in
the
state,
to
their
loads,
to
the
gross
revenue
associated
with
the--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--that
is
accurate,
your
honor,
but...
but
nominally
scheiner...
for
instance,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
the
scheiner
case
did
say
that...
did
uphold
the
fee
because
they
said
only
pennsylvania
could
charge
for
the
privilege
of
using
pennsylvania's
highways.
so
like
a
lot
of...
like
all
interstate
commerce,
you
can
always...
as...
as
the
court
said
in
nippert,
you
can
always
find...
carve
out
a
local
activity
to
say
that
this
is
going
to
be
the
focus
of
the
tax.
i
think
a
problem
here
is
with
the...
the
approach
taken
by
the
state
and
the
solicitor
general
is
they
suggest
that
you
go
back
to
the
days
in
which
you're
trying
to
draw
a
line
between
interstate
and
intrastate
activity,
this
time
not
because
the
intrastate
activity
is
going
to
be
immune
from
the
tax,
but
this
time
because
you're
going
to
have
some
separate,
different
kind
of
test
applicable
to
something
that
clearly
is
subject
to
commerce
clause
protections,
but
is...
is,
in
their
view,
subject
to
a
more
lenient
commerce
clause
protection.
and
i
don't
think
this
court
wants
to
retreat
back
to
the
days
of
having
to
draw
a
line
between
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce
and...
and
then
having
separate
tests.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
cover
three
points.
first,
i
believe
that...
that
is
accurate
to
say
that
the
solicitor
general's
position
is
returning
us
to
the
pre-complete
auto
days
of
line-drawing,
but
more
than
that,
the
solicitor
general's
position
is
ignoring
the
practical
effect
of
these
fees
on
taxpayers.
i
think
the...
the
citation
to
the
peddler
v.
drummer
line
of
cases
illustrates
that.
the
only
difference
between
the
peddler
cases
and
the
drummer
cases
was
that
in
the...
in
the
nippert
case
and...
and
the
drummer
case,
they
looked
at
the
practical
effect
on
an
out-of-state
salesman
and
whether
that
salesman
would
be
discouraged
by
the
$50
fee
that
was
being
imposed
from
coming
into
the
state.
in
the
wagner
case,
they
simply
said
that
the
fee
fell
on
an
essentially
local
event,
didn't
look
at
the
form
of
the
fee,
didn't
look
at
the
form
of
the
fee
on
the
out-of-state
salesman.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
disputed
that
to
out-of-state...
that
out-of-state
salesmen
would
be
equally
discouraged
from
coming
into
a
state
because
a
$50
fee
or
a
$100
fee,
whether
or
not
they're
carrying
the
goods
with
them
in
at
that
time
or
whether
the
goods
are
later
mailed
in.
so,
again,
it
is
returning
to
the
line-drawing
issues,
and
really
there
is
no
test
that
is
made
as
to,
after
you...
you
draw
these
lines,
what
the
appropriate
test
should
be.
the
second
point
is
it...
with
respect
to
the
administrative
practicality
of
apportioning
these
fees.
the
purpose
of
apportionment
would
not
be,
as
in
a
highway
tax,
to...
to
show
the
amount
of
highway
damage
that
was
done
by
a
truck.
the
purpose
of
apportionment
here
is
simply
to
show
the
extent
of
the
taxpayer's
level
of
activity
in
the
state.
it
would
be
like
a
general
revenue
tax
in
which
we're
trying
to
allocate
the
taxpayer's
activity
to
particular
states,
make
sure
that
that
taxpayer
is
paying
its
fair
share
of
the
state's
costs
with
respect...
of
the
state's
generic
costs,
in
this
case,
generic
regulatory
costs.
so,
again,
i
think
that
apportionment
would
be
very
easy.
as
justice
scalia
said,
the
trucking
industry
is
willing
to
take
the
onus
of
this.
we
bill
by
the
mile.
you
could
do
it
on
number
of
loads.
you
could
do
it
in
a
lot...
a
lot
of
ways.
and
by
apportioning
the
fee,
you
eliminate
the
burden
and
you
make
the
out-of-state
carrier,
who
would
be
otherwise
prohibited
from
only
hauling
a
load
or
two...
he
would
then
have
the
ability
to
haul
that
load
and...
and
not
be
discriminated
against.
the
final
area
i'd
like
to
talk
about
a
little
bit
is
the
need
for
additional...
the
need
for
evidence
in
this
case.
again,
in
the
nippert
and
the
scheiner
cases,
there...
they...
they...
it
was
expressly
said
that
there
was
no
need
for
evidence
in
the
cases
because
in
the
general
average
of
instances,
the
out-of-state
trucker
will
always
pay
more
than
the
in-state
trucker.
and
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
i
think
it
was
recognized
in
those
cases
that
there
would
be
some
exceptions
to
that
rule.
there
would
be
a
few
out-of-state
carriers
that
would
operate
more
heavily
in
the
state
than
in-state
carriers.
but
that
exception
wasn't...
wasn't
what
was
going
to
happen
and
the
most
often,
and
that
the
average
of
instances,
it
would
always
work
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
out-of-state
carriers.
and...
and
the
final
point
is
that
with
respect
to
evidence,
you
have
here
also
a
failure
of
internal
consistency
test,
and
this
court
has
said
a
number
of
times
that
failure
internal...
of
internal
consistency
is
not
a
test
related...
it
doesn't
rely
on
specific
facts
but
it
relies
on
hypotheticals.
and
in
this
instance,
i
think
there's
a
very
clear
failure
of
internal
consistency.
like
in
scheiner,
there's
a
cumulative
burden
on
an
out-of-state
trucker.
if
a
trucker
wants
to
operate
in
intrastate
commerce
around
the
country,
it
has
to...
and
just
haul
one
load
in
every
state,
it
has
to
pay
48
times
a
$100
fee
or
pay
$4,800
in
eligible...
in
order
to
be
eligible
to
haul
in
all
of
those
states.
so
that
illustrates
how
that's
going
to
balkanize
commerce,
that
that
carrier
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
pay
that
kind
of
entrance
fee
nationwide.
so
that
carrier
will
operate
in
less
intrastate
activities
in...
in
only
a
few
states
or
maybe
none.
and
again,
we
think
that
that
defeats
the
purpose.
when
congress
passed
economic
deregulation
of
the
trucking
industry,
that
they
wanted
to
open
it
up
to
out-of-state
carriers
to
be
able
to
augment
their
interstate
loads.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
thank
you.
