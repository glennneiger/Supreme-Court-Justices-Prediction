mr.
james
h.
hanson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
contrast
to
the
ata
case,
the
question
before
the
court
today
in
the
mid-con
case
is
whether
the
fee
on
vehicles
operating
solely
in
interstate
commerce
is
preempted
by
49
u.s.c.,
section
14504.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
it
is--
mr.
james
h.
hanson
--it
is
not
the
same
fee.
the...
the
fee
under
subsection
(1)
that
ata
is
arguing
about
is
an
intrastate
fee
charged
only
to--
mr.
james
h.
hanson
--carriers
that
engage
in
intrastate
activities.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
the
subsection
(2)
fee
under
478.1--
mr.
james
h.
hanson
--that
are
operating
solely
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
all
of
the
fees
under
subsections
(1)
and
(2)
are
charged
against
the
motor
carrier--
mr.
james
h.
hanson
--or--
mr.
james
h.
hanson
----motor
carrier,
not
to
the
owner.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
yes,
there
is
and
the
reason
why
there
is
a
difference
is
that
the...
the
fees
that
are
paid
for
plating
are
under
the...
under
the
international
reciprocity
plan,
the
registration
plan,
the
irp.
and
that
is
an
apportioned
fee.
it
is
charged
to
all
vehicles,
all
commercial
motor
vehicles,
regardless
of
whether
it's
for-hire
or
private,
regardless
of
it's
in
state
or...
of
interstate.
so
everybody
pays
their
apportioned
amount
based
on
mileage.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
yes,
it
does.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
he
pays--
mr.
james
h.
hanson
--but
he
would
only
pay
the
fee
based
on
his
mileage
in
the
state.
it
is
not
a
flat
fee
if
it
is
put
onto
the
irp
fees.
those--
mr.
james
h.
hanson
--the...
the
state
does.
it
is
administered
by
the
michigan
secretary
of
state--
mr.
james
h.
hanson
--but
i
believe
all
of
those
are
statutory
fees.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
the
ssrs.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
in
terms
of
the
plating
fee?
mr.
james
h.
hanson
each
state
is
free
to
charge
its...
its
own
amount
as
the
plating
fee.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
that
is--
mr.
james
h.
hanson
--that
is
correct.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
if
they
apportion
it,
however,
it
is...
it
is
not...
it
does
not...
if
they
put
it
into
the
irp,
it
is
not
part
of
the
registration
process.
the
thing
that
the--
mr.
james
h.
hanson
--well,
the...
the
difference
for
the
person
who
is
paying
it
under
irp
is
that
if
only
20
percent
of
their
interstate
miles
as
a
solely
interstate
operating
carrier,
if
only
20
percent
are
in
the
state,
they
would,
in
fact,
only
pay
$20
per
vehicle.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
if
it's...
if
it
is
put
into
a
plating
charge
as
opposed
to
a
registration...
part
of
the
registration
of
a
carrier
for
the
privilege
or
the
opportunity
to
carry
on
interstate
trucking
activities
in
the
state
of
michigan,
that
is
the
flat
fee
that
we're
talking
about.
under
the
ssrs
we
believe
that
$100
charge
exceeds
the
$10
maximum
and
is
therefore
preempted.
if
they
put
it
into
the
irp,
that...
irp
is
charged
against
the
owner
of
the
vehicle,
paid
against
the
secretary
of...
paid
to
the
secretary
of
state.
it
is
not
a
qualification
under...
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
interstate
trucking
in
the
state
of
michigan.
the
ssrs
sets
up
the
standards
by
which
a
carrier
becomes
qualified
to
operate
in
the
state.
michigan
exceeds
those
standards.
if
you
put
those
fees
into
the
irp
fees,
then
the
carrier...
or
then
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
pays
only
the
proportionate
amount
based
on
his
mileage
in
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
it
would
be
permissible
because
the...
if
the
$10
is
charged
to
the
carrier
as
part
of
the
registration
process,
in
order
to
be
qualified
to
engage
in
interstate
trucking.
the
$90
would
be
charged
to
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
and
would
be
paid
on
an
apportioned
basis
under
irp.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
if
he
said
$20
was
going
to
be
put
towards
the...
the
state
instead
of...
instead
of
$100?
mr.
james
h.
hanson
and
$80
towards
irp?
mr.
james
h.
hanson
in
that
case,
that
would
still
violate
the...
the
ssrs,
if
it
is
done
as
part
of
the
registration
process,
which
is
what
michigan
does.
michigan...
even
though
you're
properly
ssrs
registered,
michigan
still
requires,
under
its
ssrs
form...
it
directs
the
carrier
to
specifically
identify
vehicles
by
make,
model,
and
serial
number
to
obtain
a
decal
by
paying
$100
for
that
fee.
if
they
pay
$20,
that
exceeds
the
$10
maximum
that
congress
set
up
in
the
ssrs
in
order
to
be
qualified
to
operate
in
interstate
trucking
in
the
state
of
michigan,
as
an
interstate
carrier
in...
in
michigan.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
i
think
what
you
have
to
do
is
you
have
to
look
at
what
the...
the
standards
do.
the...
the
registration
standards
in
the
ssrs
are
set
up
as
the
process
by
which
a
carrier
has
the
privilege
to
enter
into
interstate
trucking
activities
in
michigan.
when
you
look
at
the
statute--
mr.
james
h.
hanson
--the
state
could
do
that
and
that
would
be
perfectly
permissible.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
it
is
not
pure
form.
any...
what...
what
congress
did
was
say
that
in
order
to
qualify
a
carrier...
they
were
concerned
about
the
burdens.
when
istea
was
enacted
in
1991,
they
were
concerned
about
the
burdens
on
carriers
of
individual
state
registration
requirements.
and
they
sought
to...
to
alleviate
that
by
making
it
so
that
carriers
could
only...
would
only
have
to
register
in
one
state
so
they
could
do
business
in
all
states
on
an
interstate
basis.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
and
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case,
justice
scalia.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
right.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
right.
i
think
what
you
have
to
do,
though,
is
go
back
and
look
at
what
michigan
does.
michigan
has
a...
a
state
statute,
478.7(1),
that
says
in
order
to
operate
to
carry
property
on
an
interstate
basis
in
michigan,
you
must
register
with
the
psc
and
you
must
pay
the
required
vehicle
fees.
the
registration
standards
are
what
they
do
as
in
accordance
with
ssrs:
insurance,
service
of
process,
and
operating
authority.
then
you
have
to
pay
a
fee,
and
the
fee
is
limited
to
$10
per
vehicle.
in
the
case
of
michigan,
those
vehicle
fees
are
set
forth
in
two
different
sections
of
the
statutes.
one
is.7(4),
which
is
the
$10
ssrs
fee.
the
other
one
is
subsection...
it's
2(2).
that
fee
is
$100--
mr.
james
h.
hanson
--in
order
for
a
michigan-plated
vehicle
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
james
h.
hanson
thank
you.
