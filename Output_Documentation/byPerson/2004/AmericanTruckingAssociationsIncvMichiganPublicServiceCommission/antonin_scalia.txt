justice

scalia
of
course,
it
also...
i
mean,
you
say
it...
it
favors
the
in-state...
intrastate
carrier
because
if
you're
doing
nothing
but
intrastate
carriage,
you...
you
amortize
the
$100
over
many
more
miles,
whereas
the
interstate
carrier,
much
of
whose
business
is
out-of-state,
doesn't
do
that.
on
the
other
hand,
you
can
certainly
argue
that...
that
this
tax
discriminates
against
intrastate
carriers
in...
in
another
respect,
that
is
to
say,
interstate
carriers
who...
who
do
nothing
within
the
state
do
not
pay
it,
whereas
the...
the
michigan
carrier
that
does
a
lot
of
interstate
business
but
if
he
does
one
piece
of
intrastate
business...
interstate
business,
he
still
pays
it.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
should
have
introduced
some
evidence
on
that
point.
i
mean,
it...
it
really
is
an
assumption
of
your
unfairness
argument
that
purely
intrastate
carriers
do
significantly
more
intrastate
business
than
interstate
carriers
who
choose
to
do
some
interstate
business.
now,
does
that
strike
you
as
self-evident?
it
does
not
need
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--demonstration?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
he...
i
didn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
your
answer.
if
you
were
finished,
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that...
that
assumes
it's
an
ssrs
charge,
and
the
state
denies
that
it...
it
has
anything
to
do
with
ssrs.
don't
you
have
to
establish
that
it's
part
of
the
ssrs
program?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
they
sought
to
but
maybe
they
didn't
succeed.
as
i
read
the
statute,
it...
it
really
applies
to
the...
the
limitation
of
$10
only
to
those
fees
that
are
ssrs
fees,
and
these
are
not.
so
maybe
there's...
there's
a
hole
in
the
federal
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
trying
to
make
the
federal
statute
work
sensibly,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
hate
to
tell
you,
but
not
all
statutes
work
sensibly.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sure
does
make
sense
to
me,
though.
surely
it's
the
case
that
a
company
that
does
nothing
but
intrastate
michigan
business
will,
by
and
large,
log
in
many
more
miles
intrastate
than
a
company
which
does
interstate
business
but
part
of
its
business
is
intrastate
michigan
business.
i...
i
just...
it
seems
to
me
obvious
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it...
it's
the
case
that
a
company
that
does
only
intrastate
michigan
business
logs
all
of
its
miles
on...
in
michigan.
right?
no
miles
outside
of
michigan.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
obvious
that
a...
a
company
that
does
interstate
business
does
not
log
all
of
its
miles
in...
in
michigan,
and
likely...
likely...
very
likely
does...
does
less
miles
in
michigan
than...
than
a
purely
intrastate
michigan
trucker.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
defend
that
position,
that...
that
it
doesn't
violate
the
commerce
clause
so
long
as
it's
a
fee
not
a
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
whenever
it's
a
fee,
not
a
tax,
you
immediately
go
to
pike
church.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know.
i
know
that's
what
they
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
found
it
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
the
same
about
a
tax.
you
could
say,
you
know,
you
only
have
to
pay
this
tax
if
you
operate
in
michigan.
you
don't
want
to
operate;
you
don't
have
to
pay
it.
and
you
could
also
say
unless
you
pay
the
tax,
you
cannot
operate
in
michigan.
does
that
make
it
a
tax
or
a
fee?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
american
trucking
association
is...
is
willing
to
be
thrown
into
the...
into
the
briar
bush
apparently.
it
certainly
involves
no...
no
difficulty
for
your
michigan
intrastate
truckers.
all
of
their
miles
are
intrastate.
and
the
plaintiffs
here
say
we're...
we're
willing
to...
you
know,
to
provide
figures
showing
how
much
of
our
carriage
was...
was
exclusively
intrastate
if
you
want
to
apportion.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
that's
the
same
thing
for
the
$10
fee
for
the
whatever
the
acronym
is
there.
that's
paid
at
the
beginning
of
the
year,
isn't
it?
and
it
has
to
be
apportioned
among
the
states.
and
you
don't
know
how
to
apportion
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
right.
but
i'm
saying
the
same
problem
arises
when
you
do
any
apportioning.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
like
a
3-day
fishing
license.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
let
me...
let
me...
i
wanted
to
ask
this
question
to
see
whether
it's
vehicle-specific.
suppose
i
have
nine
trucks.
they're
michigan-plated,
so
i
have
to
pay
$100
for
each
of
the
nine.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
suppose
i...
suppose
i
only
pay
the
fee
for
eight
of
them.
what
happens?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i've
paid
for
eight,
but
i
haven't
paid
for
the
ninth.
as
i
read
the
michigan
law,
it
says
shall
not
operate
any
motor
vehicle
upon
or
over
the
highways
of
this
state
while
any
of
the
fees
imposed
by
this
act
remain
unpaid.
now,
if...
if
i
can't
operate
the
other
eight
because
i
haven't
paid
for
the
nine,
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
vehicle-specific
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean...
i
mean
the
opposite.
it's...
it's
not
vehicle-specific.
justice
antonin
scalia
i've
paid
for
the
eight,
and
i
can't
operate
at
all
because
i
haven't
paid
for
the
ninth.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
how
it
reads.
am
i
reading
the
law
wrong?
it
says,
shall
not
operate
any
motor
vehicle
while
any
of
the
fees
imposed
by
this
act
remain
unpaid.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
all.
so
it's
not
really
vehicle-specific.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
carrier-based.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
that
seems
to
me
really
to
go
back
on...
on
scheiner.
and
i
thought
we
tried
to
get
away
from
deciding
commerce
clause
questions
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
is
interstate
commerce
or
local
commerce,
you
know,
the
original
package
doctrine
and
things
that
succeeded
it.
and
you're...
you're
just
dragging
back
in
this...
this
inquiry
into
whether
it's
really
interstate
or...
or
rather
local.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it
could.
i
mean,
if...
if
this...
this
truck
is
making
one...
one
haul,
it's
carrying
some
goods
from
texas
to...
to
maine,
but
some
other
goods
it
picks
up
along
the
way
within
tennessee
and
just
carries
it
to
another
place
within
tennessee,
and
then
it
picks
some
other
goods
in
new
jersey,
carries
it
elsewhere
to
new
jersey,
you're
going
to
be
taxed.
it
seems
to
me
it's...
it's
one
trip.
we
never
used
to...
used
to
divide
railroads
on
the
basis
of
well,
the
icc
has
jurisdiction
over
just
the
interstate
portions
and...
and
the
two
stops
within
a
state
can
be
regulated
by
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
like
to
know
the
text
you
rely
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
for...
for
preemption,
the
text
of
the
current
statute
that
you
rely
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
13501
deals
just
with
ssrs.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
say
that?
let...
let
me
come
back
to
the...
to
the
section
of
the
statute
you're
quoting.
you
didn't
finish
the
sentence.
it
says
that
it's
not
an
unreasonable
burden
when
the
state
registration
is
completed
under
standards
of
the
secretary
under
subsection
(c).
subsection
(c)
is
entitled
ssrs,
single
state
registration
system.
