justice
david
h.
souter
how
about
you?
you're
in
trouble
too,
aren't
you?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
seems
to
me...
and
i
think
what
bothers
me
is...
is
what
bothers
justice
kennedy.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
you
just
made
is
an
argument
that
given
the
pleadings
in
this
case,
the
findings
that
justice
ginsburg
just
quoted
really
were
irrelevant
findings,
that
they
should
not
have
gotten...
that
the
court
should
not
have
gotten
into
extortion
and
so
on
and
should
not
have
provided
a
remedy
for
extortion,
quite
apart
from
the
fact
of
whether
it's
an
appropriate
remedy,
constitutional
or
otherwise.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is...
is
something
that
we...
we
are
not
here
to
touch.
that's
a
question
of
california
law.
what
we
are
here
to
touch
is,
number
one,
whether
the
injunction
is
overbroad
with
respect
to
pure
speech,
and
maybe
we
are
here...
that
we
have
a
question
about
the...
the
breadth
of
the
case
we
took.
but
maybe
we
are
here
to
determine
whether
there
can
be
an
injunction
against
blackmail
or
harassing
activities.
but
i...
i
think
we're
not
here
to
decide
whether
california
could
have
gotten
to
the
question
of
blackmail,
harassment,
and
injunction
for
that.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
can
certainly...
the...
the
issue
is
certainly
before
us
as
to
whether
such
an
injunction
can
be
issued
with
respect
to
defamation
pure
and
simple.
but
the
findings
that
justice
ginsburg
has...
has
read
and
part
of
the
order
in
question
here
seems
to
go
beyond
pure
defamation.
it
goes
to
the
kind
of
demonstrative
activity
which
plausibly
is
found
to
have
been
in
aid
of
extortion.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
an
entirely
different
question.
we
may...
i'm
not
saying
we
will,
but
we
may
agree
with
you
that
it's
overbroad.
we
may
agree
with
you
that
as
to
pure
speech,
you
can't
enjoin
it.
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
every
part
of
this
injunction
is
wrong,
and
it
seems
to
me
it
is
irrelevant
as
to
whether
the...
the
state
of...
the
courts
of
california
should
have
reached
extortion.
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to
the
defamation,
pure
and
simple.
i
agree
with
you.
we...
there
is
a
heightened
standard
of
review,
but
i
don't
think
that
addresses
one
way
or
the
other
what
the
standard
should
be
when
an
action
in
the
state
courts
has
been
treated
as
an
action
both
for
defamation
and
for
extortion
or
harassment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you...
do
you
defend
the
injunction
in
its
entirety?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
the...
the...
mr.
chemerinsky
didn't
have
too
much
chance
to...
to
get
very
far
into
it,
but
one
of
his
points
was
that
there
was...
quite
apart
from
any
injunction
against
picketing,
harassment,
et
cetera,
there
was
an
injunction
simply
against
speech
on
a
given
subject
directed
to
a
lot
of
people
with
no
limit
of
time.
with
respect
to
that
last
aspect,
do
you
defend
the
injunction?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
was
directed,
number
one,
to
a
named
person
who
was
not
a
party
to
the
case,
and
it
was
directed
to
agents
and
employees
of...
of
the
named
party.
so,
i...
i
assume
that
mr.
cochran
probably
has
a
fair
number
of
agents
and
employees,
so
it
does
seem
like
a
large
number
of
people.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
you
a
law
school
question.
in...
given
the
injunction
on
its
face,
with
that
breadth,
is
that
injunction
defensible
with
respect
not
to
picketing,
not
to
harassment,
simply
to
speech
in
a
public
place?
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
asked
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
exclude
the...
the
issue
of
conduct.
i
said
forget
the
injunction
for
a
moment
with
respect
to
picketing,
with
respect
to
harassment,
and
we'll
say
with
respect
to
blackmail,
since
that
has
come
up.
forget
that.
simply
take
the
portion
of
the
injunction
that
enjoins
speech
by
these
people,
associates,
agents,
et
cetera.
on
the
subject
matter
of
the
injunction
for
all
time,
do
you
defend
that
injunction?
