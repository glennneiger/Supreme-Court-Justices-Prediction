justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
also
can't
be
the
rule
that
poor
people
can
defame
ad
libitum
and...
and
people
who
have
money
cannot.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
not
a
fair
rule
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
worthless
against
a...
against
a
person
who
has
no
assets.
justice
antonin
scalia
not...
not
this
injunction.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
permanent
injunction
as
a
remedy
in
a
defamation...
in
a
defamation
action,
preventing
all
future
speech
about
an
admitted
public
figure,
violates
the
first
amendment.
there's
no
suggestion
in
that
wording
that
you
claim
that
in
this
particular
case
there
was
no
defamation.
i...
i
just
don't
think
it's
fairly
included
within
the
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't.
it
says
whether
a
permanent
injunction
as
a
remedy
in
a
defamation
action
preventing
all
future
speech
about
an
admitted
public
figure
violates
the
first
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
nothing
about
this
particular
injunction
which
is
based
upon
speech
that
is
not
defamation.
there's
nothing
in
there
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
we
say
that
speech
that
is...
is
being
used
for
extortion
is
different,
just
as
speech
which
is
being
used
for
harassment
is
different?
and
just
as
you
can
get
an
injunction
for
the
latter,
you
ought
to
be
able
to
get
an
injunction
for
the
former.
not
all
speech,
but
only
when
speech
is
being
used
to...
to
extort
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
here
i
think
there
was...
why
isn't
there
a
use
of
fear
when,
you
know,
you're
afraid
of
this
person
destroying
your
business
by
calling
you
a
liar
and
a
cheat?
wasn't
mr.
cochran
afraid
of
that...
of
that
happening?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
chemerinsky,
let
me
put
the
question
this
way.
suppose
a
state
does
not
have
a
civil
action
for
extortion.
it
provides
criminal
remedies
but
no
civil
action
for
extortion.
why
does
the
constitution
not
permit
us
to
treat,
in
that
state
at
least,
a
civil
action
for
defamation
which
has
within
it
elements
of
distortion
differently
from
pure
defamation?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
what
future
speech
is
going
to
be.
his
future
thing
may
be,
you
know,
johnnie
cochran
shouldn't
be
elected
mayor
of
san
francisco.
that
would
be
a...
a
question
of
public
concern.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's...
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
right.
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why?
why
couldn't
he
just
be
enjoined
from...
from
similar
defamation?
i
mean,
this...
this
enjoins
him
from...
from
true
speech.
at
least
he
could...
he
could
have
been
enjoined
from
in
the
future
defaming
cochran
in
the
same
manner.
and
if
he
did
that,
then...
then
he
could
be
punished.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
he'd
like
to
get
him
up
to
san
francisco.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
he's
arguing.
you're...
you're
conceding
that
it's
overbroad.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
you're
very
perceptive.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
would...
would
that
make
mr.
cochran
happy?
what...
what's
the
big
deal
about
extortion?
i
mean,
suppose
this
same
conduct
occurs
in
the
future,
but
he
doesn't
say
i'll
stop
if
you
give
me
a
lot
of
money.
he
just
pickets
every
day
and
says
cochran
is
a
shyster,
don't
do
any
business
with
cochran.
do
you
think
mr.
cochran
would
be
any...
any
happier
simply
because
the
guy
says
i'll...
hasn't
said
i'll
stop
if
you
pay
me
$10,000?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
got
to
give
us
some
line.
i
mean,
the
only
reason
we're
grabbing
onto
extortion
is
that...
that
there's
reluctance
to
say
you
can
issue
injunctions
in
all
defamation
actions.
now,
what...
what
limitation
do
you
want
to
place
upon
the
ability
to
issue
an
injunction
if
it
is
not
defamation
combined
with
extortion?
