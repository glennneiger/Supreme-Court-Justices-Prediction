justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
your...
your
answer
should
be
to
justice
o'connor
there
is
no
effective
legal
remedy
under
your
theory
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
you...
you
say
he
has
the
remedy
of...
of
counter-speech.
we're
talking...
that's
really
that
doesn't
answer
the
question.
the
question
is,
is
there
anything
he
can
get
from
the
courts
other
than
a
damage
remedy,
and
your
answer
i
think
is
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
that
really
avoids
the
problem...
the
problem.
so
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
about
that.
then
it's
true
that
there
is
no...
there
is
no
legal
remedy
that
he
can
get.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
there
really...
there
are
findings
against
you,
and
to
say
that
a
lawyer
is
a
crook,
a
liar,
and
a
thief
and
you're
trying
to
tell
us
that
that's
not
defamatory,
i
mean,
i...
i
think
we
should
just
proceed
on...
on
some
other
basis
for
this
argument.
we
have
other
questions
to
discuss.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
this
picketing
had
taken
place
in
front
of
his
house,
every
day
in
front
of
his
house.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
well...
well,
then
this...
this
argument
you're
making,
oh,
never,
never,
the
sky
is
falling
and
so
forth,
i...
i
think
we
have
to
be
more
precise
here.
i
think
if
it
were
in
front
of
his
house,
it
would
be
different.
if
he
had
alleged
$10
worth
of
monetary
damages,
it
would
be
disparaging
the
quality
of
his
services,
which
would
be
a
trade
libel,
and
the
restatement
at
least...
i
don't
know
california
law...
says
that
you...
would
you
agree
that
you
can
enjoin
a
trade
libel--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
disparages
quality
of
goods
to
the
serious
injury
of
a...
of
a
business?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
kind
of
a
jurisprudence
is
it
that
a
person
can
go
to
jail
but
that
he's
freed
from
an
injunction?
i
mean,
why...
why
do
we
do
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
why...
is
that
true
in
every
case?
i
mean,
take
the
timid
person
who's
not
sure...
i
know
the
law
doesn't
protect
the
timid
person
in
the
first
area,
but
let's...
let's
assume
the
timid
person
is
not
sure.
so
he
wants...
he
wants
to
get
an
equitable
ruling
first,
declaratory
judgment.
he...
and
he
would
take
an
injunction.
that's
certainly
much
easier
than
going
to
jail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know,
but
i'm
asking
you
why
that...
why
that
should
be.
if...
if
you
asked
a
person
not
familiar
with
our
jurisprudence,
which
is
worse,
having
an
injunction
that
you
can
argue
about
or
going
to
jail,
i...
i
think
they
would
say
that
going
to
jail
is
worse.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
this
finding...
the
court
shouldn't
have
made
these
findings?
it
was
irrelevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
an
objection
to
the
testimony
that
established
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
add
to
justice
stevens'...
add
to
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
that
he
shows
that
he's
losing
some
clients.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
saying...
you're
saying
that
a
state
cannot
constitutionally
prohibit
someone
from
making
false
statements
in
front
of
the
business
that
causes
the
business
to
lose
money.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i'm...
my
question
is,
is
this
constitutional
to
prohibit
this
conduct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
not
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
we
ever...
have
we
ever
considered
a
case
where
there's
a
strong
element
of
extortion
involved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what...
what
you're
saying
is
that
an...
an
injunction
can
be
overbroad
based
on
past
wrongful
conduct.
and
there
is
simply
no
authority
for
that
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
have
just
pointed
out
that
it...
that
it...
it
prohibits
lawful,
harmless,
truthful
speech.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
let...
let
me
ask
you
about
that.
let's...
let's
assume,
for
the
moment,
that
a
majority
of
the
court
would
find
that
some
of
these
provisions
are
overly
broad.
is
there
any
authority
that
tells
us
what
to
do
next?
this
is
not
like
a
statute
where
we
have
to
save
the
statute.
do
we
have
any
obligation
to
save
the
injunction?
send
it
back
and
let
it
be
done.
let
it
be
done
all
over
again.
i
mean,
why...
why
should
we
rewrite
it
up
here?
do
you
have
any
authority
that
requires
us
or
permits
us
to
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if...
if
that's
so,
then
maybe
mr.
chemerinsky
is
right.
we...
we
shouldn't
have
injunctions.
if
you're
saying
that
injunctions
can't
be
narrowly
tailored,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
playing
right
into
the
argument
that
the
petitioner
is
making.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm...
i'm
baffled
by
that.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
injunction...
we're
just
all
wasting
our
time?
the
injunction
doesn't
mean
anything?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
fell
off
the
track
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
yes,
but
he's
different
from
other
citizens
because
he's
at...
he's
at
risk
of
a
contempt
citation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
his
speech
is
being
chilled
with...
with
respect
to
protected
speech.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
collateral
bar
rule
doesn't
help
you
at
all
because
he's
subject
to
a
contempt
citation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
that.
were
there
findings
to
substantiate
the
allegations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
specifically
about
the
extorting
money
from
the
bank
and
the
oil
company.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
findings.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
california
law
require
you
to
label
the
type
of
the
cause
of
action
or
is
it
notice
pleading
based
on
facts?
