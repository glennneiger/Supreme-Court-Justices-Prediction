justice

bader

mr.
chemerinsky,
you
speak
about
the
injunction,
and
the
injunction
has
three
parts.
i
thought
that
you
were
not
challenging...
at
least
the
question
presented
doesn't
suggest
you're
challenging...
the
first
one
that
concerns
distance,
the
300
yard
from
cochran
or
his
place
of
business,
and
the
third
one,
which
is
an
anti-harassment
provision.
do
i
understand
correctly
that
it
is
only
the
second
one
that
you're
challenging?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
question
is
preventing
all
future
speech
about
an
admitted
public
figure,
and
the
first
and
third
provisions
of
this
injunction
do
not
prohibit
all
future
speech.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
another
one
that
is
in
your
brief.
you
say
that
these
were
statements
of
opinion
not
fact.
but
that
surely
is
not
presented
in
your
question.
you...
you
don't...
there
were
findings
made
that
these
statements
were
defamatory,
and
your
question
presented
does
not
seem
to
me
to
encompass
at
all
the
question
whether
these
statements
were
defamatory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if...
if
this
under...
the
underlying
claim
seems
to
be
that
mr.
cochran
is
essentially
being
blackmailed;
that
is,
this...
this...
your
client
wants
tribute
to
go
away.
and
you
say,
yes,
but
it's
defamation.
it's
a
defamation
action.
therefore,
damages
is
the
only
remedy.
is
there
nothing
that
one
can
do
to
stop
another
from
engaging
in
blackmail?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
chemerinsky,
the
district...
i
mean,
the
trial
court
made
certain
findings
and
i'm
looking
at
page
42
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
first
is
that
these
statements
were
actually
made
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
cochran
to
pay
tory
amounts
of
money
which
tory
was
not
entitled.
that's
one
finding.
and
then
finding
24,
despite
repeated
requests,
tory
has
refused
to
cease
picketing
unless
he
was
paid
money...
a
monetary
settlement
by
cochran.
and
then
27
that
says
this
is
simply
use
of
false
and
privacy-invading
communications
to
coerce
or
attempt
to
improperly
coerce
payment
of
money
in
tribute
for
desisting
from
that
type
of
activity.
and
those
sound
like
findings.
it's
true
that
the
label
of
extortion
has
been
put
on
it,
but
it
certainly
does
sound
like
the...
that
the
purpose
of
the
speech
was
to
extract
money
not
owed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
take
specifically
the
words
of
the
injunction.
it's
against
orally
uttering
statements
about
cochran,
just
orally
uttering
statements
about
cochran.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
that
someone
can
be
enjoined--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you...
you
did
draft
this
injunction.
it
wasn't
the...
an
inspiration
from
the
judge
unaided
by
your
advocacy.
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this...
the
terms
of
this
injunction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you've
just
said
something
that
i
think
that's
inconsistent
with
your
earlier
presentation.
you
said
you
could
enjoin
that
posting.
here
you
said
it
wouldn't
be
effective
just
to
enjoin
the
particular
placards
that
were
used,
the
particular
words
because
then
there
would
be
other
words.
so
the
same
question
could
come
up
with
an
internet
posting
if
you
had
an
injunction
not
simply
on
what
was
posted
but
anything
about
this
particular
individual
that
might
be
posted
in
the
future.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
you...
you...
to
the
extent
that
you're
complaining
about
extortion-like
conduct,
something
else
that
you
drafted...
i'm
looking
at
the
complaint
on
page
7
of
the
joint
appendix.
you
have
identified
all
defamatory,
including
with
the
false
light
invasion
of
privacy,
but
you
don't
have
any
claim
that
looks
like
blackmail.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what...
what
i
mean
is
could
you
have...
without
using
the
label
defamation,
have
stated
a
claim
for
extortion
or
blackmail?
i'm
not
looking
at
your
particular
allegations
but
how
you
described
on
page
1
of
the
complaint
what
you
were
suing
for:
libel,
libel
per
se,
slander,
slander
per
se,
and
invasion
of
privacy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you're
asking
us
now
to...
the...
the
trial
court
found
there
was
defamation,
and
now
you
want
to
argue,
no,
it
wasn't
defamation.
it
was
mere
opinion.
i
really
don't
see
how
that's
included
in
the
question
presented.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
have
been...
there
have
been
injunctions
against
harassing
conduct,
threatening,
stalking.
