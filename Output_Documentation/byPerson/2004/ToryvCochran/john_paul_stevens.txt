may
i
ask
this...
may
i
ask
this
question?
supposing
the
only
thing
he
did
was
to
carry
a
sign
that
said
johnnie
is
a
crook,
a
liar,
and
a
thief,
and
the
trial
judge
finds
that
is
false,
and
he's
carrying
it
in
a
sign,
could
the
trial
judge
enjoin
him
from
carrying
that
sign
in
front
of
johnnie
cochran's
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
best
authority
you
have
for
that
proposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
your
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
we
ever
set
aside
an
injunction
that
did
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
we
done
it
either
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
nothing
in
the
injunction
refers
to
prior
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
injunction
just
speaks
for
itself.
it
doesn't
say
what...
doing
what
you
used
to
do
or
anything
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
cannot
picket
cochran
or
cochran's
law
firm.
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
there
are
different
grades
of
specificity.
maybe
it
doesn't
meet
precisely
the
same
words,
but
i
think
there
are
other
ways
to
draft
it
that
say
no
picketing.
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
i'm
suggesting
is
just
draft
it...
just
excising
(ii)
and
(iii)
from
paragraph
2
would
not
necessarily
solve
the
problem
completely.
just
subparagraph
(i)
says
picketing
cochran
or
cochran's
law
firm,
which
is
a
pretty
broad
prohibition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
sort
of
saying
the
opposite
of
what
your
opponent
said.
if
we
take
it
away,
has
it
ever
been
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
are
we
taking
away?
