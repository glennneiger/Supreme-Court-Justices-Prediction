we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
03-1488,
ulysses
tory
v.
johnnie
l.
cochran.
mr.
chemerinsky.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chemerinsky,
this
case
comes
up
to
us
from
a
california
appellate
court.
surely
they
know
california
law
better
than
we
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
not
going
to
debate
among
ourselves
over
what
california
law
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
add
too
that
he's
judgment-proof?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
chemerinsky.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cole,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
more
than
one
case,
we've
said
that
an
injunction
has
to
be
precise
and
clear
and
not
leaving
things
to
the
imagination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aided
and--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
can...
you
can
certainly
have,
you
know,
some
unprotected
speech
in
connection
with
extortion,
like
give
me
$5
million
or
i'll
shoot
you.
but
that...
this
was
a
far
cry
from
that.
in
other
words,
it
isn't
just
addressing
the
victim
and
saying
give
me
something.
it's
denouncing
the
victim,
which
gets
into
free
speech
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
injunction
isn't
limited
to
the
same
conduct.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
he
lived
in
l.a.--
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cole.
mr.
chemerinsky,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
chemerinsky.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
tory
against
cochran
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
