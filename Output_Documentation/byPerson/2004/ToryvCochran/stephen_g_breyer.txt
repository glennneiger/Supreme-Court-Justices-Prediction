justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
that...
that...
what
you've
quoted
many...
much
of
this
i
wouldn't
repeat
in
polite
company.
you've
reported
one
of
the
most
mild,
and
in
fact
there
are
two
findings.
one,
this
is
not
just
defamation.
it
was
an
action
for
defamation,
as
well
as
a
tort
of
invasion
of
privacy.
and
there
is
a
finding,
first,
that
this
was
done
intentionally
to
create
a
negatively
charged
and
ominous
environment,
and
this
is
not
a
matter
of
speech-related
issues.
it
is
simply
the
use
of
false
and
defamatory
and
privacy-invading
communications,
or
worse,
or
attempt
to
improperly
coerce
payment
of
money
in
tribute
for...
for
desisting
from
that
type
of
activity.
all
right.
now,
those
are
the
findings
against
you.
so
suppose
i
agreed
with
you
hypothetically
that
that,
with
all
these
findings,
is
nonetheless
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
all
right?
now,
suppose,
in
other
words,
you
convince
me
of
that.
now,
i
want
to
know
how
to
write
my
opinion
on
that
assumption
to
protect
what
i
was
worried
about
yesterday,
that
a
woman
who
has
a
boyfriend
or
a
husband
is
being
continuously
harassed
in...
with
methods
similar
to
this
one.
it's
easy
to
transpose
those
two
cases
which
are
both
on
my
mind.
and
i
want
to
know
if
in
your
opinion
that
these
restraining
orders,
which
try
to
prevent
this
kind
of
thing,
among
others,
are
unconstitutional,
if
there's
a
way
of
distinguishing
them,
if
you
could
possibly
win
on
what
theory.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
do
is
to
say
is
it
absolute.
are
there
limits?
if
so,
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
always?
do
you
want
to
apply
that
to
an
harassment
action
too
against
a
woman
who
has
the
restraining
order?
no
restraining
orders
in
divorce
cases
in
case
they're
against
speech
because
even
if
violence
is
threatened,
even
if...
et
cetera.
i
mean,
how...
how
far
do
you
want
to
push
that
principle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
if...
before
leaving
that
point,
what
the
injunction
prohibits
is
that
tory
and
those
acting
in
concert,
cooperation,
or
participation
with
him
from,
in
a
public
forum,
orally
uttering
statements
about
cochran.
all
right.
that's
what
it
says.
now,
do
you
think
that
if
tory
or
someone
acting
in
cooperation
with
him
says,
i've
had
a
change
of
heart,
johnnie
cochran
is
a
marvelous
person,
and
he
says
that
on
television...
do
you
think
that
individual
at
that
time
has
violated
this
injunction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
absolutely
not.
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
said
the
words.
they
violated
the
words.
it
was
a
statement,
but
he
has
not
violated
the
injunction
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
no.
he
does
it
in
a
public
forum.
in
fact,
he
hires
disney
hall.
[laughter]
and
moreover,
he
gets
on
stage
and
announces
it.
okay?
there's
no
problem
about
a
public
forum.
so,
now,
why
doesn't
it
violate
the
injunction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
thought
what
you
were
going
to
say...
but
you're
not.
so
i'm
very
interested
in
that,
and
i'm
glad
i
asked.
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
when
it
says
uttering
statements,
it
means
statements
of
the
kind
or
identical
to
those
we
have
identified
earlier
in
this
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
now,
you
haven't
said
that.
i
said
it,
and
i
think
it's
too
late
for
you
to
say
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
would
be
so
easy.
i
mean,
it's
virtually
no
burden.
i
take
it
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
injunction
in
paragraph
2
at
its
heart
is
aimed
at
in
public
forums,
keeping
insults
suggesting
he
was
a
crook
against
johnnie
cochran
unless
you
pay
me
$10,000.
then
i'll
stop.
okay?
now,
at
its
heart,
that's
what
it's
aimed
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
are
saying
if
in
fact
it's
ever
enforced
outside
that
heartland,
you
can
have
a
defense.
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment.
but
since
it's
so
easy
just
to
write
those
words
we
just
said
right
in
paragraph
2,
why
shouldn't
the
judge
have
to
do
it?
it's
so
easy.
say
this
is
aimed
at
the
heartland
just
as
i
said
it
and
you
said
it,
and
it
doesn't
apply
outside
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
california
work
in
that
respect?
because
what
i've
been
thinking
of
in
my
mind
is
that
maybe
we
shouldn't
decide
this
in
terms
of
state
law
boxes,
that
california
seems
to
have
an
action.
let's
call
it
a
buzz
action
to
get
away
from
words.
and
what
that
action
is
it's
a
defamation
but
a
certain
kind.
it's
defamation
accompanied
by
extortion.
and
when
you
have
defamation
accompanied
by
extortion...
call
it
whatever
you
want...
an
injunction
is
proper
in
these
circumstances.
now,
can
we
decide
it
in
such
a
way
that
we're
not
talking
about
all
defamation
actions?
we
are
talking
about
this
beast
in
california
which
uses
the
word
defamation
but
also
finds
injunction
and
therefore
issues...
also
finds
extortion
and
therefore
issues
an
injunction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
you
run
into
the
public
figure.
i
mean,
that's
a
much
more
dangerous
kind
of
rule
of
law,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
a
pure
defamation
action
against
a
public
figure,
which
they
want
to
say
this
is.
you
can
write
all
kinds
of
things
about
public
figures.
people
can
and
do,
for
better
or
for
worse.
do...
is
there
any
authority
for
issuing
in
a
pure
defamation
action
an
injunction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
johnnie
cochran
who
is
a,
as
you
probably
know,
well
known
trial
lawyer,
brought
a
state
defamation
action
in
which
he
claimed
that
the
petitioner,
ulysses
tory,
picketed
at
his
office
and
pursued
him
on
the
street,
insulting
him
in
various
ways.
apparently,
about
money
that
tory
thought
that
cochran
owed
him,
but
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
no
such
debt
of
any
kind
and
that
the
toryâ€™s
claims
lacked
any
foundation,
and
ultimately
entered
an
injunction
against
tory
that
among
other
things
ordered
him
not
to
make
any
oral
statements
about
cochran
or
his
law
firm
in
a
public
place.
tory
appealed.
he
lost.
he
sought
certiorari
here.
he
said
that
the
first
amendment
leaves
the
trial
court
without
the
power
to
issue
an
injunction
about
speech
in
a
state
defamation
action
and
in
any
event,
the
injunction
he
said
was
too
broad.
we
said
we
would
review
it,
we
read
the
briefs
and
after
oral
argument
of
the
case,
we
are
sad
to
say
that
johnnie
cochran
passed
away.
his
counsel,
now
representing
his
wife,
thinks
that
we
should
dismiss
the
case
as
moved
but
tory
has
asked
us
instead
to
vacate
the
judgment
and
remand
the
case
so
the
injunction
which
is
still
there
cannot
remain
in
effect.
we
conclude
that
the
case,
at
least,
in
so
far
as
federal
law
is
concerned
is
not
really
moved.
nonetheless
circumstances
have
changed
dramatically
so
that
the
injunction
as
it
now
stands
lacks
the
reasons
that
brought
it
into
existence
in
the
first
place.
so,
it
is
clearly
too
broad
as
it
now
stands
and
consequently
must
violate
the
first
amendment.
so,
for
that
reason
and
others
which
we
set
forth
in
an
opinion,
we
vacate
the
decision
of
the
california
appeals
court
to
remand
the
case.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
