but
that
isn't
what
you've
said
in
the
question
presented.
why
shouldn't
we
be
limited
to
answering
the
question
presented?
and
that
would
leave
the
other
parts
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
you
understand
justice
ginsburg's
question
surely,
and
i
would
imagine
that
even
if
you
prevail,
nothing
we
would
order
would
affect
the
first
and
third
parts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
chemerinsky,
is
it
true
that
your
client
intends
to
go
on
defaming
mr.
cochran?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
he
intend
to
continue
making
the
same
comments
that
he
made
before?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
now,
let
me
ask
you
this.
under
your
theory,
if...
if
the
defendant
is
judgment-proof,
does
respondent
have
any
remedy
at
all
if
the
statements
are
defamatory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if...
if
the
defendant
is
judgment-proof,
what
good
does
that
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
can't
square
that
with
the
near
case
at
all.
i...
i
mean,
the...
the
injunction
on
its
face
in
part
2
has
the
appearance
of
being
overly
broad.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
it
does
on
its
face.
i
mean,
it
is
clearly
overbroad.
now,
what
should
we
do
about
that?
