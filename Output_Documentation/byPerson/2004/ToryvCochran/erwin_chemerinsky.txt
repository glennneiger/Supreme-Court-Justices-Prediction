mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
good
morning.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
injunction
in
this
case
violates
the
most
basic
principles
of
the
first
amendment.
it's
a
prior
restraint.
it's
a
content-based
restriction
on
speech.
it's
vastly
overbroad.
it
even
restricts
the
speech
of
those
who
are
not
a
party
to
the
lawsuit,
such
as
petitioner
ruth
craft.
the
injunction
in
this
case
is
inconsistent
with
this
country's
unique
and
profound
commitment
that
speech
by
public
officials
and
public
figures
be
open,
robust,
and
uninhibited.
one
way
in
which
the
injunction
is
clearly
unconstitutional
is
in
restricting
the
speech
of
those
who
are
not
a
party
to
the
lawsuit.
for
example,
ruth
craft
is
expressly
restrained
from
ever
speaking
again
about
johnnie
cochran
even
though
she
was
never
named
as
a
party
to
the
lawsuit.
and,
in
fact,
cochran's
attorney
admitted
at
the
beginning
of
trial,
she
wasn't
a
part
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
this
injunction
is
so
broad
that
if
i
talk
about
johnnie
cochran
or
this
case
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
this
court
or
pass
out
copies
of
the
brief
or
speak
to
any
reporter,
i
am
violating
the
terms
of
the
injunction
and
i
could
be
held
in
contempt
of
court.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor.
the
question
presented
is
that
the
injunction
is
unconstitutional.
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
injunction
is
unconstitutional
is
that
it's
based
on
speech
that's
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
all
of
the
statements
that
were
uttered
by
mr.
tory
are
opinion
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
there
is
not
the
requisite
actual
malice.
and
so
it's
our
position
that
the
injunction
itself
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
it's
our
position,
though,
that
the
injunction
is
based
on
speech
that's
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
we
believe
that
the
question
presented
is
that
the
injunction
is
impermissible
in
its
restriction
of
speech.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
of
course,
you're
limited
to
the
question
presented.
our
position,
though,
is
that
the
injunction
in
its
restriction
of
speech
is
unconstitutional.
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
injunction
is
unconstitutional
is
that
all
of
the
speech
that
occurred
in
this
case
is
speech
that's
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
your
honor,
certainly
we
believe
that
the
injunction
is
most
clearly
unconstitutional
in
its
overbreadth.
we
believe
also
and
separately
the
injunction
is
unconstitutional
because
injunctions
are
not
a
permissible
remedy
in
a
defamation
case,
especially
concerning
public
officials
and
public
figures.
but
it's
also
our
position
that
the
injunction
is
based
on
speech
that's
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
thus,
the
injunction
violates
the
first
amendment.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
believe
our
client
has
ever
defamed
mr.
cochran.
we
believe
that
all
of
his
speech
is
just
opinion.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
his
exact
words
were
that
perhaps
he
would
continue
to
express
his
view
that
mr.
cochran
owes
him
money.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
there
is,
of
course,
a
remedy.
since
we're
dealing
here
with
a
public
figure,
there
is
the
remedy
of
expressing
views
which
this
court
has
said
in
gertz
v.
welch
is
available
to
a
public
figure.
there
is
a
damage
judgment
that's
available.
certainly,
your
honor,
there
can't
be
a
different
rule--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
there
is
a
damage
judgment
that
forever
would
be
available
against
the
person.
and
it
cannot
be,
your
honor,
that
those
who
are
poor
will
have
injunctions--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
that's
correct,
your
honor.
from
the
courts,
he
can
get
a
damage
remedy
but
i
don't
accept
that
a
damage
remedy
is
inadequate
just
because
a
person
may
be
poor.
the
damage
remedy
will
be
that
they'd
be
collected
for
the
person
who
gets
assets
in
the
future.
also,
as
i
was
saying
to
justice
o'connor,
it
can't
be--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but
then,
justice
kennedy,
it
can't
be
the
rule
that
poor
people
have
their
speech
enjoined,
but
those
with
assets
can
continue
to
speak
in
the
future.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor,
but
that's
why
there
would
be,
of
course,
the
ability
of
a
court
to
issue
a
damage
judgment.
there
are
many
instances
in
which
damage
judgments
can't
be
collected.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
but
that's
true
everywhere
in
the
legal
system,
your
honor.
and
i
would
also
argue
here
that
none
of
mr.
tory's
statements
were
defamatory.
i
would
point--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--i
would
disagree,
your
honor.
the
question
presented
is
whether
this
injunction,
the
forever
stops
speech,
violates
the
first
amendment.
one
reason
why--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
question
presented
does
ask
whether
this
injunction,
which
permanently
restricts
speech--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--we
would
argue--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
our
position
is
that
question
asks
whether
an
injunction
violates
the
first
amendment,
and
certainly
it
is
about
this
case.
and
our
position
is
that
all
of
the
speech
that
was
expressed
in
this
case
is
opinion.
and
it's
important--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
now,
if
that's
so--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--sure.
but,
your
honor,
i
want
to
just
respond
to
that.
the
exact
statement
there
was...
and
i'll
quote
it
for
you
and
it
is
on
page
54
of
the
joint
appendix.
johnnie
is
a
crook,
a
liar,
and
a
thief.
can
a
lawyer
go
to
heaven?
luke
11:46.
your
honor,
this
court
has
said,
for
example,
in
greenbelt
cooperative
that
charging
somebody
with
blackmail
is
expressing
opinion.
in
letter
carriers
v.
austin
this
court
said
calling
somebody
a
traitor
is
opinion.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
would
suggest
three
different
ways
in
which
you
could
write
the
opinion
that
distinguished
the
case.
the
first
is
that
this
injunction
is
vastly
overbroad,
that
even
if
there
can
be
an
injunction
to
say
that
ulysses
tory
and
ruth
craft
can
never
again
say
anything
about
johnnie
cochran
in
any
public
forum,
that
i
can
never
speak
about
johnnie
cochran
would
violate
the
first
amendment.
a
second
way
of
distinguishing
is
that
defamation
is
different,
that
when
the
first
amendment
was
adopted,
the
clear
history
was
that
above
all
it
was
to
prevent
prior
restraints,
and
that
injunctions
were
not
permitted
in
defamation
actions.
that's
quite
different
than
a
harassment
action.
and
third,
as
i've
argued,
what
makes
this
different
is
the
basis
for
this
injunction
is
speech
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
with
regard
to
the
findings
that
you
referred
to,
you
mentioned
two.
the
first
is
invasion
of
privacy.
your
honor,
the
only
privacy
claim
in
this
case
was
false
light
invasion
of
privacy.
california
law
is
clear.
when
there
is
a
defamation
action
and
a
false
light
claim,
the
false
light
claim
is
automatically
dismissed
as
duplicative
when
it's
based
on
the
same
fact.
the
second
basis
you
pointed--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
your
honor,
but
they
did
not
base
their
decision
on
the
privacy
claim
because
california
law
is
clear
that
when
it's
false
light
invasion
of
privacy
brought
together
with
a
defamation
action,
the
false
light
claim
is
dismissed.
that's
a
california
case,
couch
v.
san
jose
unified
school
district.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor.
all
i'm
saying
is
it's
important
to
be
clear
about
what
the
privacy
claim
is.
as
i
was
saying
to
justice
breyer,
there
may
be
privacy
claims
that
give
rise
to
injunctions.
harassment
claims
may
give
rise
to
injunctions,
but
not
the
privacy
claim
in
this
case
which
was
just
about
false
light,
which
even
the
california
court
of
appeal
admitted
is
treated
together
with
defamation.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
under
frisby
v.
schultz,
that
would
be
a
different
situation.
under
frisby
v.
schultz,
this
court
said--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--actually,
your
honor,
the
vast
majority
of
cases
have
held
that
you
cannot
have
an
injunction
for
product
defamation.
and
so
i
think
while
that's
a
different
and
more
difficult
question,
most
courts
have
said
no
even
there.
and
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
there
can
never
be
injunctions.
but
i
am
saying
that
this
court
has
said
there's
a
very
strong
and
heavy
presumption
against
injunctions,
and
that
never,
not
once
in
the
214-year
history
of
the
first
amendment,
has
this
court
ever
upheld
an
injunction
as
a
remedy
in
a
defamation
action.
and,
your
honor--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
if
this
was
blackmail
or
extortion,
johnnie
cochran
could
have
filed
a
criminal
complaint
with
the
police.
he
could
have
civilly
sued
for
blackmail
or
extortion.
but,
your
honor,
this
wasn't
extortion.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
your
honor,
that's
because
this
court
has
said
that
injunctions
of
speech
are
even
worse
than
criminal
penalties.
i
would
refer
this
court--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but,
your
honor,
i'd
remind
you
of
this
court's
language
in
the
vance
v.
universal
amusement
where
the
court
said
presumption
against
prior
restraints
is
heavier
and
the
degree
of
protection
broader
than
against
limits
on
criminal
penalties.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
but,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
first
amendment,
there
are
reasons
why
an
injunction
has
always
been
regarded
as
worse.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
i
don't
want
to
push
the
principle
at
all
to
harassment.
i
believe
that
injunctions
are
completely
appropriate
in
harassment
actions.
i
think
it
is
quite
important
to
note
that
the
california
harassment
statute
expressly
excludes
speech
which
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
as
being
a
basis
for
harassment.
the
history
of
the
first
amendment
is
different.
to
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
it's
always
been
thought
that
an
injunction
strikes
at
the
very
heart
of
the
first
amendment
because,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
your
honor,
there
can
be
an
injunction
for
extortion,
but
this
was
not
extortion.
there
was
never
the
criminal
complaint.
there
was
never
the
civil
action.
and
it
didn't
meet
the
requirements
for
extortion.
your
honor,
california
law,
penal
code
section
518,
defines
extortion
as,
quote,
the
obtaining
of
property
from
another
with
his
consent
induced
by
a
wrongful
use
of
force
or
fear.
there
wasn't
the
wrongful
use
of
force
or
fear.
now,
it
may
be
that
ulysses
tory
was
speaking--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
this
court
is
required
to
do
an
independent
review
of
the
record
under
bose
v.
consumers
union.
there's
no
indication
that
mr.
cochran
suffered
that
fear
from
mr.
tory
being
outside.
it's
true
that
mr.
tory
may
have
believed
that
he
was
owed
money
by
johnnie
cochran
and
was
also
trying
to
encourage
mr.
cochran
to
pay.
but
this
court
has
said
in
cases
like
naacp
v.
claiborne
hardware
speech
does
not
lose
its
protective
character
simply
because
it
may
embarrass
others
or
coerce
them
into
action.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
but,
your
honor,
since
this
is
a
defamation
action,
not
an
extortion
action,
the
rules
under
the
first
amendment
for
defamation
have
to
apply.
under
the
rules
of
the
first
amendment
for
defamation,
injunctions
are
not
available
to
public
officials
or
public
figures.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
tory,
who
was
appearing
pro
se
in
the
trial
court,
from
the
very
outset
objected
that
he
was
being
held
liable
for
speech
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor.
i
certainly
agree
with
the
first
point.
one
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
this
injunction
is
overbroad,
and
it
clearly
is
in
terms
of
the
breadth
of
speech
that's
regulated
and
whose
regulated.
but
as
to
the
second
point
that
you
make,
this
is
a
defamation
action,
and
thus
the
issue
before
this
court,
clearly
presented
in
the
question
presented,
is
whether
a
permanent
injunction
can
be
issued
in
a
defamation
case
remedy
when
the
plaintiff
is
a
public
figure.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
would
disagree
in
this
way,
your
honor.
bose
v.
consumers
union
makes
clear
that
when
it
is
a
defamation
action,
this
court
and
every
appellate
court
has
to
do
an
independent
review
of
the
record.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
but,
your
honor,
it
was
not
treated
here
as
an
action
for
extortion
or
harassment--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
i
would
say
the
history
of
the
first
amendment
is
different.
a
state
can
create
a
civil
action
then
for
extortion
at
the
urging
of
this
court,
but
if
you
open
the
door
to
injunctions
in
defamation
cases,
then
there's
the
possibility
that
in
any
defamation
case,
somebody
might
plead
something
about
extortion,
and
injunctions
will
not
be
rare
but
will
be
the
norm.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor,
because
the
law
is
clear
that
injunctions
are
not
a
permissible
remedy
in
defamation
cases.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
near
v.
minnesota
would
be
the
best
authority
where
this
court
said
clearly
that
injunctive
relief
should
not
be
awarded
in
a
defamation
case.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
but,
your
honor,
even...
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
don't
think
that
changes
the
hypothetical
in
terms
of
enjoining
the
defamatory
speech.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
again,
as
i
said
to
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
it
can
matter
whether
he's
judgment-proof
because
we
can't
have
a
different
rule
that
we
allow
poor
people's
speech
to
enjoin
and
not
wealthy
people.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
your
honor,
there
are
other
causes
of
action
that
may
allow
that.
if
it
could
be--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--not
in
a
defamation
action,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
i
would
say
that
the
authority
comes
from
the
fact
that
never
in
214
years
has
this
court
ever
upheld
an
injunction
in
a
defamation
case.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
well,
not
under
those
facts.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
would
say
yes,
extortion
for
austin
v.
keith.
there
was
speech
to
pressure,
and
yet
this
court
said
even
though
the
speech
was
to
pressure,
it's
still
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
the
time
for
rebuttal,
if
that's
permissible.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
thank
you.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
thank
you.
justice
breyer
kindly
invited
my
thoughts
about
how
an
opinion
might
be
written,
and
there
are
three
different
ways
not
mutually
exclusive.
one
is
that
this
injunction
is
vastly
overbroad
for
all
the
reasons
that
have
been
identified.
mr.
cole
said
a
couple
of
things.
one,
he
said
that
mr.
tory
can
go
to
court
and
ask
for
modification
of
the
injunction,
but
that's
what
makes
this
a
prior
restraint,
that
mr.
tory
can
only
speak
again
if
he
goes
to
court
and
gets
permission.
also,
he
said
at
the
end
that
mr.
tory
can
go
before
the
media.
however,
under
california
law,
under
damon
v.
ocean
hill,
the
media
is
defined
as
a
public
forum.
a
second
way
the
opinion
could
be
written
is
that
this
for
speech
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked
me
at
the
outset
whether
that's
in
the
scope
of
the
question
presented.
well,
it
is
directly
relevant
to
what
mr.
cole
was
saying.
because
it's
all
opinion,
all
hyperbole
it
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
can't
be
the
basis
for
an
extortion
claim.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
think
it
is
because
it
goes
to
the
question
whether
the
injunction
is
permissible.
but
i
go
on
to
the
third
way
that
the
opinion
could
be
written,
and
that's
that
injunctions
are
not
permissible
as
a
remedy
in
a
defamation
case.
we
agree
that
if
there
is
a
cause
of
action
for
extortion,
it
can
have
an
injunction
as
a
remedy.
we
agree
if
the
cause
of
action
is
for
harassment,
there
can
be
an
injunction
as
a
remedy.
but
those
have
specific
elements
that
have
to
be
met.
those
elements
weren't
met
in
this
case.
history
is
clear
that
injunctions
aren't
allowed
in
defamation
cases,
and
also,
your
honor,
it's
quite
important
that
mr.
cole
even
said
you
can't
craft
a
narrow
injunction
in
a
defamation
case.
any
injunction
is
either
too
narrow
or
too
broad.
in
near
v.
minnesota,
this
court
said
that
it
was
telling
that
in
150
years
of
the
history
of
the
first
amendment,
there
had
never
been
an
injunction
approved
by
this
court
in
a
defamation
case.
we're
now
70
years
later
than
that.
to
approve
an
injunction
in
a
case
like
this,
even
though
it's
called
defamation
plus
extortion,
will
open
the
door
to
injunctions
as
a
routine
matter
in
defamation
cases
across
the
country.
no--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--yes,
your
honor,
and
we
have
no
objection
to
injunctions
of
that
sort.
what
we
object
to
is
an
injunction
as
a
remedy
in
a
defamation
case
and
an
injunction
that
is
directed
at
speech.
that's
what
the
first
amendment
prohibits.
thank
you.
