mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
years,
mr.
tory
has
relentlessly
targeted
johnnie
cochran
with
a
pattern
of
defamatory
speech
in
a
public
forum
for
purpose
of
causing
mr.
cochran
to
pay
mr.
tory
money
in
tribute
for
ceasing
from
this
unprotected
activity.
he
admitted
at
trial
he
intended
to
engage
in
this
conduct.
he
was
doing
it
just
so
he
could
be
paid
money,
and
when
asked
if
he
would
continue
to
do
so,
he
stated
he
would.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
yes--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--yes.
first
of
all,
i
don't
believe
it
was
directed
to
a
lot
of
people.
as
this--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--i
believe
this
court
said
in
madsen
that
that
would
raise
an
abstract
controversy
that
mr.
tory
doesn't
have
standing
to
attack
the
injunction
for
other
persons
who
are
not
before
the
court.
no
aider
or
abetter
has
ever
been
served
with
this
injunction.
ms.
craft
has
never
been
served
with
this
injunction.
only
mr.
tory.
so
i
don't
believe--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--i
defend
the
injunction,
and
respondent
defends
the
injunction
on
the
ground
that
it
is
conduct
that
was
being
enjoined--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--from
the
use
of
unprotected
speech.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
yes,
we
defend
the
injunction.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
yes.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
based
upon
the
unique
facts
of
this
case,
justice
ginsburg,
i
say
somebody
can
be
enjoined.
i
don't
say
that
in
the
abstract.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
but
in
near,
they
set
forth
certain
factors,
and
those
factors
included
that
it
was
not
a
private
redress
of
private
wrongs.
the
information
was
of
legitimate
public
concern.
neither
of
those
elements
are
present
in
this
action.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
but,
justice
scalia,
what
i'm
relying
on
is
the
fact
that
he
has
engaged
in
3
years
in
a
pattern
of
continuing,
repetitive
conduct.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
injunction
is
necessarily
overbroad
based
upon
that
proposition
because
i
believe
there
are--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--i
disagree
with
that,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
well,
if
you're
asking
me,
based
upon
the
breadth
of
the
injunction,
what
i...
if...
if
there
was...
are
you
asking
me
what
i
would
do
to
modify
the
injunction?
you
could
merely
strike...
you
could
leave
intact
paragraph
2
and
you
could
strike
simply
subsections
(ii)
and
(iii)
as
being
unconstitutionally
overbroad.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
yes.
in...
in
madsen,
justice
kennedy,
you
struck...
the
court
struck
certain
provisions
as
being
unconstitutionally
overbroad
and
left
certain
intact.
so
there's
no
reason
why
you
can't
look
at
this
injunction,
which
clearly
does
not
attack
paragraph
1.
the...
they
do
not
attack
paragraph
1.
they
do
not
attack
paragraph
3.
they
only
level
their
attack
at
paragraph
2,
and
paragraph
2,
by
striking
subsections
(ii)
and
(iii),
would
then
be
limited
to
the
exact
conduct
in
issue,
which
is
picketing.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
absolutely
not.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
first
of
all,
that's
why--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--because
i
don't
believe
that's
a
public
forum.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
your...
your
honor,
i
believe
there
are
alternative
channels
of
communication
here.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
well,
i
was--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--i
think
i
said
it
when
i
said
there
was
a
continuing
pattern
of
repetitive
conduct
under
pittsburgh
press,
over
3
years
that
that
was
the
conduct
that
he
has
engaged
in.
and
that
was
clearly
the
purpose
of
this
injunction,
justice
breyer.
we
know
that.
and
the
purpose
of
the
injunction
is
to
enjoin
conduct
that's
designed
to
extort
money
from
mr.
cochran.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
well,
i
think
this
is
precise
and
clear.
based
upon
the
breadth
of
the
injunction,
it's
very
clear.
based
upon
this
man's
prior
repetitive
conduct
of
defaming
mr.
cochran
with
unprotected
speech
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
extort
money
from
him--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--the
injunction--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--if
we
restricted
the
injunction
to
specific
words
used
such
as
you
cannot
picket
johnnie
cochran's
law
firm
and
say
he's
a
crook,
liar,
and
thief,
the
response
will
be
that
he'll
come
up
with
five
new
words
to
defame
mr.
cochran
for
purposes
of
extorting--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--well,
there
could
be
no
picketing
for
purposes
of...
no...
which
contains
defamatory
speech
for
purposes
of
extorting
mr.
cochran.
but--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--well,
i
would
disagree
based
upon
the
prior...
continuing
course
of...
of
repetitive
conduct
and
the
fact
that
this...
over
a
period
3
years,
once
a
week,
this
man
spent
3
to
4
hours
a
day
of
his
time
defaming
mr.
cochran
at
his
law
office.
when
we
enjoined
him
from
doing
so
at
his
law
office,
he
moved
it
to
the
los
angeles
superior
court.
and
i
think
the
fact
that
mr.
cochran
is
a
public
figure
actually
favors
the
breadth
of
this
injunction.
if
this
was
not
a
public
figure,
then
the
public
forum
issue
would
not
be
as
effective.
but
because
mr.
cochran
is
a
public
figure,
the
only
way
he
gets
protection
is
in
the
public
forum
because
this
gentleman
could
move
his
picketing
down
to
west
l.a.,
santa
monica
boulevard,
nowhere
near
a
courthouse,
and
to
a
public
figure
he
can
inflict
the
same
damage
to
reputation.
and
that
is
the
problem
we
were
contending
with
in
attempting
to
draft
an
injunction
that
was
not
overbroad
and
yet
could
control
mr.
tory--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--it--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--were
aided...
were
aided
by
my
advocacy,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
well
said,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
what
i'm
suggesting
here
is
mr.
cochran
would
have
been
faced
with...
he
has
no
remedy.
injunctive
relief
is
the
only
remedy.
and
he
would
be
faced
with
a
multiplicity
of
actions--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--i
think
we
would
be...
that
injunction
then
would
be
attacked
on
being
vague
or
ambiguous,
that
mr.
tory
wouldn't
have
sufficient
notice
as
to
what
he
was
allowed
to
say
and
not
allowed
to
say.
i
guarantee
you
that
was--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--no.
i
think
they
can
be
tailored.
i
just
don't
think
they
can
be
that
narrowly
tailored.
and
i
don't
think
in
this
case,
which
i
believe
that
the
test
we
should
be
applying
if
we're
going
to
balance,
is
this...
there's
no
need
for
this
injunction
to
be
drafted
in
the
least
restrictive
means.
i
also
continue
to
advance
the
argument
that
this...
the
facts
of
this
case
are
unique.
it's
the
use
of
speech
to
engage
in
unprotected
conduct.
this...
this
conduct
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
conduct
of
attempting
to
extort
money
from
mr.
cochran
is
not
protected.
if
that
is
not
protected,
then
i
believe
we
can
craft--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--it
certainly
does,
justice
rehnquist.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
there
was
no
remedy
for
mr.
cochran
that
would
have
avoided
a
multiplicity
of
actions
other
than
to
draft
the
injunction
in
a
form
that
would
preclude
mr.
tory
from
engaging
in
the
same
conduct
without
regard
to
whether
it
was...
and
to
let
him
know
clearly...
give
him
a
safe
harbor
as
to
what
he
could
and
could
not
say.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
but
i
don't
think
it
needs
to
be
because
of
the
pattern
and
practice
that
this
man
has
engaged
in
over
3
years.
and
if
we
take
the
example,
which
is
so
he
has
a
change
of
heart
and
suddenly
he
now
wants
to
praise
mr.
cochran
and
that's
become
his...
and
he's
going
to
promote
him
as
mayor
of
san
francisco,
he
can
certainly
go
into
the
court
and
modify
the
injunction.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
he
can
certainly
seek
to
modify
the
injunction,
and
that,
as
i
pointed
out
in
a
subsequent
letter
brief,
there's...
california
doesn't
adopt
the
collateral
bar
rule.
and
therefore,
he
has
a
check
and
balance
in
this
case.
under
people
v.
gonzales,
12
cal.
4th
805,
the
collateral
bar
rule
has
no
application
in
the
state
of
california.
so
in
the
unlikely
event
that
mr.
tory
was
engaged
in
speech
praising
mr.
cochran,
one,
and
two,
in
the...
in
the
more
unlikely
event
that
someone
was
going
to
attempt
to
cite
him
for
contempt
for
engaging
in
protected
speech,
he
could
contest,
under
first
amendment
grounds,
the
enforcement
of
this
injunction
in
the
state
of
california
because
the
collateral
bar
rule
has
no
impact.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
no,
no,
no,
no.
justice
kennedy,
all
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--all
i'm...
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
the
collateral
bar
rule
was
in
effect,
you
would
waive
your
right
to
contest.
you
don't
have
a
right
to
contest
the
constitutionality
of
the
injunction
on
first
amendment
grounds
or
constitutional
grounds
when
it's
seek
to
be
enforced
against
you.
that's
not
a
defense
in
a
contempt
proceeding.
california
does
not
adopt
that
rule.
therefore,
mr.
tory
can
always...
if
he
is
engaged
in
protected
speech,
he
can
easily
contend--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--i
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
but
there's
nothing
unusual--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--he's
subject
to
it,
but
there's
a
check
and
balance
there
in
terms
of
when
you
balance,
the
potential
remedy
for
mr.
cochran...
what...
what
is
going
to
give
mr.
cochran
the
remedy
he
needs?
and
if
we
balance
that
against
the...
the
breadth
of
this
injunction,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at...
one
of
the
biggest
concerns
about
prior
restraints,
when
analyzed
in
terms
of
injunctions,
is
the
collateral
bar
rule.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
that's
exactly--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--and
i
have
no
dispute
with
that,
justice
breyer.
i
agree
that
was
the
whole
purpose
for
the
injunction.
that's
the
basis
of
the
injunction.
and
you
could
always
remand
for
further
proceedings,
consistent
with
any
opinion
you
would
write,
that
the
injunction
has
to
be
tailored
to...
to
deal
with
defamatory
conduct,
which
is
designed
to
extort
or
with
the
intent
to
extort.
and
i--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--i'm
saying
if
this
court...
well,
i'm
gleaning
the
impression
that
this
court
thinks
it's
overbroad.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
and
having
gleaned
that
perception,
i'm
trying
to
suggest
that,
number
one,
there
was
no
attack
on
paragraphs
1
and
3,
and
now
we're
focused
on
paragraph
2.
and
paragraph
2
can
be
tailored,
as
you
have
indicated,
justice
scalia,
i
think
consistent
with
first
amendment
issues.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
if
we
take
away
injunctive
relief
in
a
defamation
action
in
this
day...
modern
age--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--it's
never
been
there.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
i...
i
agree
it's
never...
you've
never
found
it
there
and
you've
never
said
it
can't
be
there.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
yes,
i
think
that
you
could
limit
the
injunction
to
defamatory
speech
of
a
similar
nature
designed
to
extort.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
no,
and
i
think
that
would
be
subject
to
the
same
injunctive
relief.
i
think
this
case
is
unique
with
the
extortion
element,
but
i
don't
disagree,
justice
scalia,
that
that
is
why
any
decision
that
says
injunctions
in
defamation
actions
would
be
improper.
i
think
people
would
start
defaming
with
impunity.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
i
don't
think
you
need
to
place
a
limitation
other
than
you
can
enjoin
the
defamation
conduct.
take,
for
example,
the
internet.
a
posting
goes
on
of
a...
of
a
business
that...
a
startup
company.
it
can't...
damages
of...
for
a
startup
company...
they're
very
difficult
to
prove.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
there's
no
authority,
but
there's
no
authority
that
says
you
can't
do
it.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
in...
is
in
a
pure
defamation
action
that's
not
tied
to
any
specific
wrongful
conduct,
there's
no
reason
why
you
couldn't
enjoin.
for
example,
if
you
found
that
a
specific
item
was
defamatory
on
its
face,
such
as
a
posting
on
the
internet,
the
only
way
to
get
that
posting
off
the
internet
would
be
to
enjoin
it
because
damages
aren't
going
to
solve
the
problem.
and
if
it's...
even
if
it's
purely
defamatory,
you
could
restrict
it
to
that
purely
defamatory
posting,
similar
to...
to
the
obscenity
cases
where
you've
reviewed
a
film,
you
found
it
to
be
obscene,
and
then
you
preclude
it.
there
are
procedural
safeguards
and
you
preclude
it
in
the
future.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
where
that
leaves
us
is
you'd
have
to
engage
in
some
sort
of
balancing
about
the...
how
narrowly
tailored
the
injunction
is
and
does
it
provide
a
sufficient
remedy
and,
you
know...
and...
and
in
this...
and
what
test
we
would
analyze
it
under,
strict
scrutiny,
intermediate
scrutiny,
or
the
ward
test.
and...
and
i
think
that
in
applying
those
tests,
you'd
have
to
come
to
a
balance,
and
if
the
balance
is
that
you're
going
to
limit
it
to
a
specific
type
of
speech
or...
then
that...
that
would
be
a...
a
reasonable
limit,
and
if
it
creates
a
multiplicity
of
actions,
well,
so
be
it.
but
at
least
there's
a
remedy
for
that
posting
or
postings
of
a
similar
nature.
so--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--if
you'd...
if
i
could
direct
you,
justice
ginsburg,
to
page
12
of
the
joint
appendix
at
paragraphs
(j)
and
(k)
of
the
verified
complaint,
you
will
see
that
we
alleged
in
a
verified
complaint
that
he'd
engaged
in
three
previous
efforts
of
this
same
type
of
conduct,
one.
and
two,
paragraph
(k),
that
tory
is
in
the
business
of
professionally
extorting
monies
from
innocent
persons
and
business--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--findings
to
substantiate--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--no,
justice
kennedy,
there
were
not.
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
there
was
some
testimony
only
on
one
of
those
issues,
which
was
the
oil
company.
there
was
no
findings
on
this
issue.
but
then
i
would
refer
you
to
paragraph
(k)
which
specifically
refers
to
extorting
of
monies.
and
also
in
my
opening
statement,
as
is
reflected
in
the
trial's
transcript,
the...
the
first
thing
i
said
is
this
is
speech
designed
for
an
improper
purpose.
it's
unprotected
speech
designed
to
extort
money
from
mr.
cochran.
that
was
the
whole
theme--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--i
think
we
could
have
pled
extortion
had
we
chose
to.
we
could
have
pled
inference
with
advantageous
business
relations.
we
probably
could
have
pled
california's--
mr.
jonathan
b.
cole
--notice
pleading
based
on
facts,
but
we
do
label
the
causes
of
action.
the...
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
whether
every
cause
of
action
was
pled,
if
the
conduct
is
extortion,
which
is
what
the
judge
implicitly
found
by
findings
20
and
27,
that
conduct
is
not
protected.
and
whether
we
named
the
cause
of
action
correct
in
the
complaint
or
we
sued
for
that
specified
cause
of
action,
doesn't
change
what
it
is
that
we
were
seeking
relief
for,
which
is
stopping
this
man
from
defaming
mr.
cochran
until
he
was
paid
money.
we
attempted
to
achieve
that.
we
thought
we
did
a
fair
job
in
paragraphs
1
and
3,
which
they
don't
attack
and
i
agree
is
not
fairly
included
within
the
question
which
has
been
certified
here,
nor
is
an
attack
on
the
underlying
finding.
but
we
attempted
in
paragraph
2,
broadly
i
agree,
to
avoid
a
multiplicity
of
actions
and
to
give
mr.
tory
other
channels
of
communication
other
than
the
public
forum
where
he
is
engaged
in
a
continuing
course
of
repetitive
conduct
to
defame
mr.
cochran.
he...
and...
and
this
is...
one
point
that
i
want
to
stress.
we
don't
view
this
injunction
as
being
violated
if
he
went
on
tv,
he
went
on
the
radio,
he
went
in
the
newspapers.
we
don't
view
those
as
public
forums
under
the
definition
that
this
court
has
provided.
those
are
not
public
forums.
we
are
not
concerned
about
that.
we
do
not
believe
that
those
events
will
occur.
we
did
not
seek
to
protect
them.
so
we
have
given
mr.
tory
an
unlimited
venue
to
speak,
but
we
said
you
can't
do
this
in
the
public
forum
because
of
your
continuing
course
of
repetitive
conduct,
3
years,
once
a
week,
52
times
a
year,
over
150
times,
4
hours
a
day.
and
with
that,
i
would
submit
that
while
the
injunction
is
broad,
i
don't
believe
it's
a
unconstitutional
prior
restraint,
and
to
the
extent
this
court
believes
it
is
overbroad,
i
believe
striking
subparagraphs
(ii)
and
(iii)
of
paragraph
2
would
solve
the
problem,
or
alternatively,
that
in
conjunction
with
a
suggestion
that
it
needs
to
be
narrowed
to
deal
with
the
speech
and
conduct
in
issue.
thank
you.
