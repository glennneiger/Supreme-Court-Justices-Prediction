mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
action
arises
under
federal
law
not
only
when
federal
law
supplies
the
cause
of
action,
but
also
when
the
plaintiff's
right
to
relief
under
a
well-pleaded
state
law
cause
of
action
necessarily
depends
on
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law.
that
second
category
of
arising-under
jurisdiction
is...
applies
here
because
petitioner's
right
to
relief
under
its
state
law
quiet
title
action
necessarily
depends
on
the
allegation
in
its
well-pleaded
complaint
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--right.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
in
the
taylor
line
of
cases,
what
is
necessary
to...
to
allege
in
a
well-pleaded
complaint
for
common
law
ejectment
is
only
that
i
have
title
and
you're
wrongfully
here.
you
do
not
have
to
plead
the
facts
that
show
superiority
of
title.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no.
on
taylor
v.
anderson
you
are
not.
but
the
difference,
justice
kennedy,
is
in
that
kind
of
case,
the
plaintiff
wouldn't
be
eliminating
the
cloud
on
his
title.
he
would
just
be
getting
possession
of
the
property.
so
there's
always
going
to
be
an
incentive
for
the
plaintiff
who's
faced
with
a
document,
a
deed,
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--to...
to
sue
for
cloud
on
title.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
true.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
in
the
common
law
cause
of
action,
which
isn't
available
in
michigan,
but
under
the
common
law
cause
of
action,
all
was...
all
that
was
determined
was
that
you
had
a
right
to
possession
at
the
time
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it...
it
is,
justice
scalia.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
the...
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
does.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
and
the
justification
for
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
that
the
court
has
authored
is
that
it
provides
a
quick
rule
of
thumb
for
determining
at
the
outset
of
the
litigation
which
cases
are
most
likely
to
be
ones
where
the
federal
law
issues
are
at
the
forefront.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
because
merrell
dow
did
not
involve
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law,
and
that
was
part
of
the
test
that
i
announced.
and
the
difference
between
this
case
and
merrell
dow
is
twofold.
first,
this
case
falls
within
the
hopkins
line
of
cases,
and
second,
this...
the
role
of
federal
law
in
merrell
dow
is
completely
different
than
it
was
in
this
case
and
in
the
hopkins
line
of
cases.
what
was
going
on
in
merrell
dow
is
that
the
state
adopted
a
federal
standard
as
presumptive
evidence
of
state
law
negligence,
and
when
a
state
adopts
a
federal
standard
into
its
own
state
law
standard,
the...
the
action
remains
one
that
is
fundamentally
state
law
in
character.
so
the
federal
question
in
the
case
is
not
regarded
as
substantial.
but
here,
the
situation
is
entirely
different.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
you
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
court
in
merrell
dow
drew
a
distinction
between
what
is
substantial
enough
of
a
federal
question
to
trigger
arising-under
jurisdiction
as
an
original
matter
and
what
is
substantial
enough
of
a
federal
question
to
obtain
this
court's
review.
and
we're
dealing
here
just
with
the
kind
of
substantiality
that's
necessary
for
original
jurisdiction
under
1331.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
let
me
draw
a
distinction
between
those
cases
where
the
cause
of
action
is
supplied
by
federal
law,
in
which
case
factual
issues
are
resolved
by
federal
courts
as
long
as
there's
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
cases
where
there's
not
a
federal
cause
of
action.
then
you
need...
the
right
to
relief
has
to
depend
on
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law.
so
if
the
only
issue
in
the
case,
in
that
kind
of
case,
is
a
factual
dispute
and
everybody
agrees
on
the
law,
then
there's
no
substantial
federal
question,
no
removal
jurisdiction.
but
if
the
right
to
relief
depends
on
federal
law
and
the
meaning
of
federal
law
and
there's
also
a
factual
issue
in
the
case,
that
would
be
removable.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it's...
it's
removable
if
the
only
question
was
whether
notice
was
given.
but
if
the
question
is
was
sufficient
notice
given
such
as
to
transfer
title
under
federal
law,
then
that's
removable.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
slices
the
baloney
the
way
this
court's
cases
have
sliced
the
baloney,
and
that...
that
rule
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law.
there
is
one
when
the
action
depends
on
the
meaning
of
federal
law,
but
not
one
where
everybody
agrees
on
the
meaning
of
federal
law
and
all
that's
at
issue
is
a
dispute
about
the
facts.
now,
this
case,
as
i
said,
does
fall
within
the
hopkins
line
of
cases,
and
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
court
held
there
was
arising-under
jurisdiction
in
a
quiet
title
action
where
the
plaintiff's
claim
that
it
had
superior
title
to
the
land
in
question
depended
on
the
meaning
of
federal
law.
and,
of
course,
that's
true
here.
the
quiet
title
action
provides
the
mechanism
for
review
of
this
question,
but
the
question
is
entirely
one
of
federal
law
as
to
who
has
the
superior
interest
in
the
land,
the
tax
sale
purchaser
or
the
taxpayer.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
