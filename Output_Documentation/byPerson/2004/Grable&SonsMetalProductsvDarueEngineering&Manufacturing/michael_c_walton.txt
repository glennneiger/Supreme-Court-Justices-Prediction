mr.
michael
c.
walton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
only
questions
of
federal
law.
it
involves
no
questions
of
fact.
there
are
no
disputes
on
any
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
and
without
the
federal
law,
there
would
be
no
controversy,
there
would
be
no
claim,
there
would
be
no
cause
of
action.
the
plaintiff's
right
to
relief
in
the
case
requires
resolution
of
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law
in
dispute
between
the
parties
in
this
case,
which
implicates
substantial
federal
interests.
the
attempt
to
distinguish
merrell
dow...
merrell
dow
is,
in
fact,
consistent
with
smith/gully/franchise
tax
in
establishing
that
test.
and
the
language
which
the
court
utilized
in
merrell
dow
does
not,
in
any
way,
abandon
those
cases
or
indicate
that
the
logic
is
inappropriate.
the
merrell
dow
place
in
the
evaluation...
in
the...
in
the
kaleidoscopic
situations
which
were
described
by
justice
cardoza
is
in
a
situation
where
a
federal
standard
has
been
incorporated
into
the
state
law
cause
of
action.
that's
its
place
here.
it
was,
i
believe,
by
this
court
an
attempt
to...
to
illuminate
what
would
occur
in
that
circumstance,
and
it
is
limited
to
that
circumstance.
and
the...
the
question,
which
is
set
forth
at
the
beginning
in
merrell
dow,
about
the
incorporation...
and
i'm...
i'm
at
page
805.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
incorporation
of
a
federal
standard
in
a
state
law
cause
of
action,
when
congress
intended
there
be
no
federal
private
action
for
violations
of
that
federal
standard,
makes
one
arising
under
the
constitution,
laws,
or
treaties
of
the
united
states,
all
three.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
i
believe
that
that
would
be
a
state
cause
of
action,
yes.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
then
i...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
then
i
believe
that
would
be
federal,
yes.
that
would
require
resolution...
that
would
require
construction
of
the
federal
statute.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
if
it's...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
if
it
still
presents
a
question
of
federal
law,
yes.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
i
think
that
it
could
still
be
a
substantial
federal
question
because
it
could
implicate
a
substantial
federal
interest.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
it
would...
it
would
then
be
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
yes.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
i
believe...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
i
believe
that
it
could
be
removable
because
it
could
still
involve
the
application
of
the
federal
law--
mr.
michael
c.
walton
--i
see,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
your
honor,
i'm
not
certain.
that's...
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
certain.
i
believe
that
it
could
be
removable,
still
utilizing
the
application
of
the
federal
law
to
that
circumstance,
even
in
the
factual
dispute.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
yes.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
walton
that's
accurate,
your
honor.
excuse
me.
if
there
are
no
additional
questions,
thank
you.
