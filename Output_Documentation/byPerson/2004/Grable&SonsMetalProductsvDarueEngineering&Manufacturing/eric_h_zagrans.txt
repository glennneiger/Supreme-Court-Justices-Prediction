mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
mr.
chief
justice,
good
morning,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
merrell
dow
pharmaceuticals,
the
court
recognized
an
important
limitation
on
the
court's
prior
substantial
federal
question
cases.
the
sixth
circuit
should
have
followed
merrell
dow
rather
than
ignoring
it
in
deciding
whether
the
presence
of
a
federal
issue
in
this
michigan
quiet
title
action
properly
gave
rise
to
federal
question
jurisdiction.
according
to
merrell
dow,
any
state
law
claim
that
alleges
a
violation
of
a
federal
statute
as
an
element
of
the
state
law
cause
of
action
does
not
state
a
claim
arising
under
federal
law
for
section
1331
purposes
unless--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--no,
justice
o'connor,
we
do
not
take
that
position.
we
take
merrell
dow--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--agreed.
we
believe
that
merrell
dow's
decision
can
be
synthesized
with
the
holdings
in
those
cases
that
your
honor
is
referring
to
by
reference
to
the
nature
of
the
federal
interest
that
is
at
stake
and
the
role
that
congress
plays.
in
the
smith
v.
kansas
city
title
&
trust
company
line
of
cases
and
in
hopkins
v.
walker,
both
of
those
are
different
sorts
of
cases
from
merrell
dow
where
congress
provided
the
federal
right
that
was
alleged
to
have
been
violated,
and
the
court
held
that
when
congress
provides
a
federal
statute
that
is...
is
serving
as
an
element
of
a
state
law
claim,
then
congress
must
have
intended
also
to
provide
a
federal
private
right
of
action
in
order
for
there
to
be
arising-under
jurisdiction.
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
justice
souter,
i
agree
that
it
is
a
federal
issue.
i
disagree,
with
respect,
that
it's
different
from
merrell
dow
because
in
both
that
case
and
this
quiet
title
action
under
michigan
law,
the
alleged
federal
issue
is
one
element
that
needs
to
be
alleged
and
proved
in
order
to
make
out
the
state
law
claim.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
i
see,
your
honor.
under
michigan's
compiled
laws
and
under
the
rule
of
procedure
that
this
action
was
brought
under,
the
plaintiff
had
to
allege
and
prove
four
things:
that
he
had
title,
the
alleged
nature
of
the
defendant's
title.
he
had
to
describe
the
property
with
reasonable
particularity,
and
finally,
he
had
to
allege
why
his
title
was
superior
to
the
defendant's
title.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
and
that
is
the
only
federal
issue,
just
like
in
merrell
dow
where
the
federal...
the
violation
of
the
federal
labeling
standard
was
alleged
to
constitute
one
element
of
the
product
liability
claim
in
that
case.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
no
doubt,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
think
it
is
the
wrong
emphasis
to
look
to
what
the
state's
interest
is,
which
was
a...
a
part
of
the
focus
that
the
solicitor
general's
was
on.
for
purposes
of
deciding
whether
or
not
congress
intended
there
to
be
federal
question
jurisdiction,
i
don't
believe
the
focus
should
be
on
the
state's
interest.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
yes,
sir.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
no,
but
go
ahead,
justice
kennedy,
please.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
justice
kennedy--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--there
are,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
to
give
a...
an
honest
and
principled
answer
to
justice
souter's
and
justice
ginsburg's
questions,
i
have
to
face
it
in
line
of
merrell
dow
and
the
cases
that
merrell
dow
relied
on.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
yes,
sir,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
hope
so
too.
justice--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
i
agree.
it
is
good
law.
and
i
think
the
distinction
that
i
am
asking
the
court
to
draw
between
that
case
and
merrell
dow
is
this.
both
cases
should
be
decided
under
the
rubric
that
arising-under
jurisdiction
depends
upon
whether
a
federal
issue
in
an
otherwise
state
law
case
provides
a...
a...
an
outcome-determinative
means
of
resolving
the
case,
and
that...
in
other
words,
where
the
resolution
of
the
case
depends
upon
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law.
but
the
difference
between
kansas
city
title
&
trust
and
merrell
dow
is
the
nature
of
the
federal
interest
at
stake
and
the
different
ways
they
should
be
applied.
in
kansas
city
title
&
trust,
the
interest
was...
or
the
alleged
violation
was
a
federal
constitutional
violation.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
i
believe
that
the
court
in
merrell
dow
made
a
limitation
on
that
phrase
that
your
honor
is
quoting
from,
and
the
limitation
is
where
congress
controls
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
such
as
with
federal
statutory
law,
then
the
limitation
of
merrell
dow
that
congress
must
also
have
intended
to
create
a
federal
private
right
of
action
obtains.
i
believe
that's--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--when...
when,
as
merrell
dow
says,
congress
intended
there
to
be
a
federal
private
right
of
action
for
violation
of
the
statute
is
alleged
to
be--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
we
are
arguing.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
your
honor,
congress
has
not
created
a
jurisdictional
statute
for
federal
constitutional
claims,
which
is
why
the
bivens
doctrine
arose,
unlike
section
1983.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
it
derives
from
footnote
12
of
merrell
dow
where
the
court
was
attempting
to
explain
this...
this
difference
that
we
are
discussing.
and
in
footnote
12
of
merrell
dow,
the
court
says
that
the
nature
of
the
jurisdictional
answer
will
frequently
depend
upon
the
different
nature
of
the
federal
interest
that
is
at
stake.
and
it
distinguished
between
smith
and...
and
moore
in
that
case,
smith
being
a
federal
constitutional
question,
moore
being
a
federal
statutory
question.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
well,
your
honor,
yes,
i
do
because
of
the
nature
of
congress'
control
over
whether
or
not
there
should
be
federal
private
rights
of
action.
it
is
consistent
with
the
court's
implied
private
right
of
action
jurisprudence
from
alexander
v.
sandoval,
from
the
central
national
bank
of
denver
case,
et
cetera.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
no,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
you
can
because
as
many
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
point
out,
those
words
are
broad.
they
are
the
exact
same
language
that
the
constitutional
grant
of
article
iii
jurisdiction
uses,
and
therefore,
they
have
to
be
given
content
in
some
other
fashion.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
clearly
the--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--the
strength
of
the
federal
interest
is
important,
justice
kennedy,
but
as
merrell
dow
pointed
out,
the
federal
interest
is
not
deemed
to
be
substantial
enough,
or
the
federal
question
at
stake
in
the
case
is
not
deemed
to
be
sufficiently
substantial
unless
congress
has
created
a
federal
private
right
of
action
for
violation
of
the
particular
statute
that
is
being
pled.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
justice
breyer,
i
disagree
with
the
premise
of
that
thought.
congress
in
section
7433
did
provide
what
i
would
like
to
call
a
federal
private
right
of
action.
it's
an
action
by
a
private
party
against
the
government,
not
another
private
party,
for
damages
in
the
event
the
government
violates
federal
law
in
the
tax
collection
process.
what
congress
did
not
do...
and
the
solicitor
general
concedes
it
did
not
do...
is
create
a
federal
private
right
of
action
for
quiet
title
claims
in
disputes
between
two
private
parties.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
you
would
bring,
your
honor,
a
state
quiet
title
action,
as
grable
did
in
michigan
court,
and
allege,
as
the
basis
for
the
superiority
of
plaintiff's
title
in
that
case,
the
violation
of
federal
statute
by
the
federal
agents.
and
therefore,
the
purchaser
at
this
federal
tax
sale,
darue
engineering
in
this
case,
does
not
have
superior
title.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
what--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--what
differs,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--i
think
without
question,
your
honor.
what
congress,
we
are
arguing,
did
not
approve
is
the
removal
of
that
state
law
quiet
title
action
to
federal
court
under
arising-under
jurisdiction
merely
because
of
the
presence
of
a
federal
issue
as
an
element
of
the
state
law
claim.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
yes,
i
agree,
your
honor.
and
in
merrell
dow,
the
court
held
that
in
those
middle
cases--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--why
was
that
a
middle
case?
because
in
merrell
dow,
the
state
of
ohio
had
product
liability
tort
law--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--but--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--your
honor,
when
congress
enacted
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
and
did
not
provide
a
federal
cause
of
action
for
it
and
yet
laid
out
federal
standards
of
conduct
for
labeling
of
drugs
like
bendectin
in
that
case,
congress
must
have
understood
that
without
it
creating
a
federal
private
right
of
action,
the
states...
the
state
product
liability
law,
state
inadequate
warning
law
would
subsume
claims--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--for
a
violation
of
that
federal
standard.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
justice
ginsburg,
that's
an
argument
that
appears
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
as
well,
and
i
believe
that
the
solicitor
general's
focus
on
a
difference
in
state
interests
is
misplaced
when
one
is
dealing
with
federal
jurisdictional
principles.
instead,
i
think
the
focus
should
be
on
the
expression
of
the
federal
interest,
and
the
best
expression
of
the
federal
interest
at
stake
is
congressional
intent
when
one
is
dealing
with
acts
of
congress,
federal
statutory
law.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--that's
exactly
right.
that's
exactly
right.
to...
to
try
to...
to
try
to
not
have
to
argue
that,
as
justice
o'connor's
initial
question
to
me
supposed,
that
all
of
that
prior
case
law,
prior
to
franchise
tax
board
and
merrell
dow,
somehow
would
go
out
the
window
sub
silentio.
and
that's
not
what
we
are
arguing.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
because,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
focus
is
on
the
substantiality
of
the
federal
question
and
that's
where
the
difference
between
the
two
situations
you
are
positing
lies.
with
constitutional
claims,
they
are
almost
always
substantial
federal
questions.
with
federal
statutory
violations
alleged
as
part
of
a
state
law
cause
of
action,
merrell
dow
says
they
are
not
substantial
enough
to
confer
arising-under
jurisdiction
unless
congress
intended
to
create
a
federal
private
right
of
action
for
the
violation
of
that
particular
statute.
so--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--yes,
your
honor.
i...
i
suppose
that
would
be
the
effect
of
how
it
would
have
to
be
read--
but
it's
not
a
question
of
one
federal
interest
is
less
than
another.
anytime
federal
law
is
involved,
the
federal
interest
is
great.
the
issue
is
for
arising-under
purposes,
for
section
1331
purposes,
whether
the
federal
question
is
substantial
or
not
sufficiently
substantial
to
confer
arising-under
jurisdiction.
that's
the
import
in
our
argument
and
our
submission,
the
holding
of
merrell
dow.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
no,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
you
could
because
i
think
to
do
that
would
federalize
a
great
many
state
law
causes
of
action
that
just
happen
to
have,
as
an
element
of
them,
a
violation
of
some
federal
law
that,
due
to
the
supremacy
clause,
the
states
would,
of
course,
be
obliged
to
enforce.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
an
example
would
be
anytime
a
tax
preparer
makes
a
mistake
of
federal
income
tax
law
in...
in
preparing
a
return
for
a
client
and,
as
a
result
of
that,
the
client
pays
more
tax
than
they
otherwise
should
have
and
they
have
a
claim
against
the
tax
preparer
either
for
common
law
negligence
or
professional
malpractice
under
state
law,
but
why
did
the...
the
preparer
commit
malpractice?
because
of
an
interpretation
of
federal
tax
law.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
the
tax
code,
section
6338(b)
specifically
provides
that
title
passes
under
state
law,
not
under
federal
law.
the
only
issue
of
federal
law
here--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--the
only
issue
of
federal
law
here
that
is
determinative
is
whether
or
not
the
agents
gave
proper
notice
of
the
seizure.
and
interestingly,
justice
ginsburg
made
reference
to
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule.
there
is
a
secondary
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
the
disputed
issue
of
federal
law
was
not
part
of
the
well-pleaded
complaint.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
irs
failed
to
give
the
statutorily
required
notice
of
personal
notice.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
it
was,
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
in
the
complaint
that
they
failed
to
do
it.
that
is
undisputed.
the...
the
defendant
concedes
it.
the
government
concedes
it.
what
was
disputed
was
that
there's
a
different
statute--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--agreed,
your
honor.
but
some
of
the
cases
suggest
that
the
issue
of
federal
law,
in
order
to
be
deemed
substantial,
must
be
one
that
is
in
good
faith
disputed.
that
is
to
say,
undisputed
issues
of
federal
law
are
not
substantial
enough
by
themselves
to
confer
federal
question
jurisdiction.
so
i
point
out
that
the
disputed
federal
issue
from
a
different
statute,
6339(b)(2),
is
in
the
nature
of
a
defense
that
darue
asserted.
notwithstanding
the
strict...
the
lack
of
strict
compliance
with
the
notice
provision,
6339(b)(2)
allows
substantial
compliance.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
justice
kennedy,
under
michigan
law,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
distinction
any
longer.
the
action
to
determine
title
under
michigan
compiled
law
600.2932
seems
to
telescope
and
subsume
both
of
those
common
law
causes
of
action
into
one.
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
thank
you,
your
honor.
we
agree
with
general
gornstein's
statement
of
the
test.
the
test
is
a
state
cause
of
action
that
necessarily
depends
on
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law
arises
under
for
1331
purposes.
the
difference
between
my
argument
and
the
argument
of
respondent
is
the
meaning
of
substantial
or
what
constitutes
substantiality.
and
in
merrell
dow,
the
court
held
for
all
federal
statutory
purposes
the
federal
law
is
not
substantial
enough
to
confer
arising-under
jurisdiction
unless
congress
created
a
private
remedy
along
with
the
statute.
that's
where
we
part
company.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
i
agree,
justice
ginsburg,
is...
it
is
a
federal
question
as
a
common
sense
matter
and
every
other
way.
it
does
not
follow
that
it
should
be
decided
and
adjudicated
by
a
federal
court.
state
courts
can
and
do--
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
merrell
dow's
emphasis
on
making
pragmatic,
sensitive
judgments,
judgments
that
are
both
principled
and
common
sense,
dictated
the
holding
in
that
case
which
was
when
it's
an
act
of
congress
that
is
being
inserted
as
an
element
of
a
state
law
claim,
in
order
then
to
bootstrap
that
state
law
claim
into
federal
court
on
removal
jurisdiction,
there
would
need
to
be
a
substantial
federal
question.
who
decides
that?
congress
decides
that,
both
as
a
matter
of
judicial
power
and
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
application.
and
that's
the
distinction,
by
the
way,
with
the
hopkins
line
of
cases.
i
don't
believe
that
the
hopkins
line
is
any
different
from
the
smith
v.
kansas
city
title
&
trust
line
in
terms
of
this
emphasis
on
necessarily
depending
on
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law.
the
difference
in
hopkins
is
that
those
were
competing
federal
land
claims.
the
only
thing
in
the
case
was
federal
law.
both
sides
took
their
entitlement
to
the
property
from
federal
mining
law,
and
the
federal
issues
in
that
case
either
were
exclusive
of
all
the
legal
issues
or
so
overwhelmingly
predominated
over
the
state
law
issues,
that
that
was
the
result
in
those
cases.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
there
are
many
state
law
issues
in
this
case,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
state
quiet
title
action.
the
only
disputed
issue
and
the
issue
that
the
respondent
says
the
state
law
claim
necessarily
depends
for
its
resolution
is
this
disputed
issue
of
federal
law
over
the
notice.
mr.
eric
h.
zagrans
thank
you.
