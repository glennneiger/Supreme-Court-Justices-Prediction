justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
the
state
law
incorporated
the
federal
standard
and
made
it
its
own.
here
you
have
the
federal
tax
sale
and
a
very
strong
federal
interest,
which
was
lacking
in
merrell
dow.
justice
stevens
said
that.
but
here
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
government
has
a
very
strong
interest
in
seeing
that
tax
sales
convey
a
secure
title.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
justice
o'connor
had
asked
you
about
the...
the
quiet
title
cases,
but
kansas
city
title
&
trust
is
still
good
law.
it
wasn't
overruled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
court
didn't
make
it...
the
court's
proposition
in
kansas
city
title
&
trust
was
if
it
appears
from
the
complaint
that
the
right
to
relief
depends
on
the
construction
or
application
of
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states.
so
are
you
asking
us
to
take
out
or
laws
as
dictum,
or
what
is
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
when
does...
when
does
the...
when
do
the
words,
or
laws,
in
kansas
city
title
&
trust
have
operative
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mean
that
the...
are
you
saying
then
in
the
context
of
this
case
that
the
federal
law
would
have
to
create
a
quiet
title
action,
which
is
traditionally
state
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wasn't
necessary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was...
that's
the
difference.
the
state
in
merrell
dow
chose
to
adopt
those
federal
standards.
it
was
a
choice.
i
don't
think
a
state
has
the
prerogative
to
ignore
the
effect
of
a
federal
tax
sale.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
state
choice,
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
large
difference
between
the
two
cases:
one,
where
the
state
chooses
to
recognize
federal
standards
when
it
doesn't
have
to,
and
here,
there's
no
question
that
the
federal
law
governs
the
security
of
this
title.
it's
not
an
option
for
the
state
to
ignore
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
so
you
are...
you
are
proposing
one
way
to
reconcile
kansas
city.
you
say,
well,
that's
the
constitutional
claim.
but
why
isn't
it
at
least
as
good
a
reconciliation
to
say
once
you
go
through...
there's...
there's
a
federal
claim...
there's
a
federal
question
that's
dispositive
of
this
case,
and
you
agree
that
that's
so
here.
the
whole
thing
turns
on
the
meaning
and
effect
of
that
notice
provision.
so
the
federal
question
is
what
determines
this
case,
and
you
satisfy
the
well-pleaded
complaint
standard.
then
at
that
point,
when
you
satisfy
the
basic
kansas
city
title
&
trust
provisions,
then
to
see
which
way
to
swing,
why
isn't
it
appropriate
to
say
is
this
a
case
where
the
state
has
a
large
interest
and
the
federal
interest
is
not
significant?
or,
on
the
other
hand,
is
it
a
case
where
there
is
a
large
federal
interest
in
seeing
how
this
comes
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
that
merrell
dow
did
take
out
those
words,
or
laws,
from
the
kansas
city
title
&
trust.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
that
in
the...
in
the
pleading?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
that
in
the
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
but
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doesn't
say
it
has
to
be
a
disputed
allegation.
it
says
it
must
be.
you
couldn't
state
the
claim
without
having
the
federal
law
in
the
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--suppose
the...
there
was
an
issue
in
this
case
about
the
plaintiff
in
the
quiet
title
action
having
waited
too
long.
i
think
here
it
was
6
years
after.
so...
so
suppose
there
was
a
defense
of
laches
under
state
law.
that
could
be
an
issue
in
an
action
in
this
format,
quiet
title
action,
which
would
be
governed
by
state
law.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
case
wouldn't
be
removable
then
if
the...
if
the
defense
is
laches?
the
plaintiff--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
might
never
get
to
the
federal
law
if
the
determination
of
6
years
is
too
long
to
wait
to
bring
a
suit
like
this.
then
you
would
remove
and
you
could
have
an
outcome
based
solely
on
state
law
in
the
federal
court.
you'd
have
a
state
claim.
the
issue
that
divides
the
parties
is
how
long
was
too
long,
and
the
court
decides
the
case
on
that
basis
and
never
gets
to
the
federal
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
laches
is
pleaded
as
a
defense,
then
it's
not
removable?
but
don't
you...
well--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
at
what
point
do
you
remove
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
complaint
is
filed
in
state
court,
and
you
are
the
defendant
and
you
want
to
remove
that
case
to
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
much
time
do
you
have
to
remove?
would
it
be
in
advance
of
your
answer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
in
my
case,
you
would
remove
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint
before
you
put
in
your
answer,
and
i
think
you're--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
then
you
could
get
into
the
federal
court,
and
the
answer
could
be
laches
and
you're
in
the
federal
court
and
the
only
question
that's
decided
is
the
state
law
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
zagrans,
there
is
language
in
merrell
dow
that
makes
it
sound
like
it's
not
as
clear
and
certain
as
you
are
urging.
i
think
that
the
opinion
author
said
that
1331's
domain
is
shaped
by
the
demands
of
reason
and
coherence,
dictates
of
sound
judicial
policy,
and
common
sense.
and
if
you
just
take
that
last
question
when
the
only
question
is,
is
mail
notice
good
enough
to
satisfy
the
federal
statute,
or
do
you
have
to
have
in-hand
service?
doesn't
common
sense
say
what
that
section
means
should
be
a
federal
question,
appropriate
for
a
federal
court
to
decide?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
simply
making
the
point
that
you
are
reading
merrill
lynch...
merrell
dow
in
a
rather
rigid
way.
and
yet,
there
is
this
language
in
it
that
says
in...
in...
what
was
before
the
court
in
merrell
dow
made
perfectly
good
sense
in
that
tort
action
to
have
it
going
on
in
state
court.
this
is
quite
a
different
picture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
there
was
no
state
law
issue
in
this
case,
that
the
whole
thing
turned
on
what
kind
of
notion...
notice
was
sufficient
to
convey
title.
