justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
my--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--please,
please.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
did
you
finish
your
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
please.
well,
my...
my
initial
view
of
this
case
was
much
like
justice
souter's
and...
and
i
still
think
that
that
may
be...
may
be
correct.
but
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
souter
would
be
that
there
are
many
cases
in
which
there
is
an
antecedent
federal
title
which
then
goes
down
through
successive
purchasers,
mining
claims,
for
instance,
and
those
are
always
under
state
law.
i...
i
thought
that
would
be
your
answer
to
justice
souter
and...
and
also
to
justice
ginsburg.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
rely
on
merrell
dow,
which
is
fine.
but
i
thought
there
was
a
separate
line
of
cases
that
support
you,
as
well
as
merrell
dow.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
can't
get
anything
out
of
the
words
of
the...
of
the
statute
arising
under
to
help
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
just
the
strength
of
the
federal
interest
is
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
controlling
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
you
want
to
reserve
your
time.
just
one
quick
thing.
the
government
makes
the
distinction
between
an
action
to
remove
a
cloud
on
title
and
an
action
for
possession.
do
you
agree
that
this
is
a...
a
action
to
remove
a
cloud
on
title?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
the
plaintiff
here
alleged
that
the
tax
deed
were
forged,
that
the
occupant
simply
forged
the
tax
deed
and
was
occupied
under
forgery.
state
cause
of
action
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
then
suppose
he
alleged
not
that
it
was
forged,
but
that
this...
that
the
occupier
of
the
land
had...
had
misconstrued
the
occupier's
rights
to
bid
at
the
tax
sale
or...
or
that
there...
the
tax
sale
should
never
have
been
held.
then
that's
a
federal--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
and
how
is
that
different
from
the
forgery?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how...
how
is
that
different
from
the
forgery
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
wouldn't
that
same
rule
apply
in
a
state
where
there's
a
common
law
cause
of
action
for
ejectment
and
it's
substantively
under
state
law
different
from
a
cloud
on
the
title?
you
discuss
in
your
brief,
very
helpfully
i
think,
the...
the
hopkins
and
the
taylor
line
of
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
your
statement
that
you
just
made
consistent
with
the
court's
holding
under
the
taylor
line
of
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
we
had
exactly
the
facts
of
this
case
and
there's
a
common
law
ejectment,
you
would
not
say
that
it
goes
to
federal
court.
it
would
stay
in
state
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
suppose
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
a
common
law
ejectment
action
that
we
are
supposing
that
what's
going
to
come
up
is
the
tax
sale.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
is
just
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
i
suppose
that
if
the
plaintiff
prevails
on
the
common
law
cause
of
action
for
ejectment,
he's
got
a...
a
res
judicata
defense
if
the...
if
the
present
occupier
then
makes
another
suit
based
on
the
tax
deed.
