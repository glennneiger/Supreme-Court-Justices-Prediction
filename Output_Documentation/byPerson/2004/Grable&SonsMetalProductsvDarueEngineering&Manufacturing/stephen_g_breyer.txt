well,
maybe
this
needs...
i
mean,
if
were
to
clarify--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i...
i
wanted
to
follow
up
on
this
because
i
think
it's
a
confusion
that's
embedded
in
my
mind
in
some
of
the
cases,
exactly
what
justice
scalia
was
asking
you.
and
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
whether
the
confusion,
as
i
see
it,
that's
involved
here
is
the
words...
arises
out
of
the
words,
private
right
of
action.
private
right
of
action
is
where,
a,
one
private
person
sues
b,
a
non-federal
person,
under
a
federal
statute.
and
the
reason
that
can
lead
to
confusion
is
because
where
you
have
a
statute
that
governs
the
relation
between
the
federal
government
and
a
private
person,
the
words
private
right
of
action
are
out
of
place
normally,
because
an
action
between
the
two
parties
takes
place
usually
under
the
apa.
now,
that's
what
it
seems
to
me
is
at
work
here
because
the
real
question
is
not
whether
we
have
a
private
right
of
action
or
apa
review.
the
question
is
whether
congress
wanted
to
allow
a
private
person
to
use
this
particular
federal
provision
as
the
basis
for
judicial
review
in
a
lawsuit.
and
if
that's
the
right
question,
the
answer
here
is
obviously
it
did.
it
happens
that
we
would
have
titled
that
normally
administrative
procedural
review
under
the
apa.
but
whether
you
call
it
private
right
of
action
or
you
call
it
apa
review
is
beside
the
point.
in
merrell
dow,
congress
did
not
want
actions
to
come
into
a
court
under
the
statute
there
at
issue.
in
this
case,
congress
doesn't
mind
at
all.
in
fact,
it
expects
actions
to
come
into
court
under
this
statute.
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
that
thought.
