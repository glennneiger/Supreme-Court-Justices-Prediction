justice
antonin
scalia
but
doesn't
congress
have
to
create
causes
of
action
for
constitutional
violations
as
well,
or
at
least
for
most
of
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
i...
that
i'm
satisfied
with
the
answer.
you're...
you're
trying
to
give
us
one
rule
for
constitutional
claims
and
another
rule
for
statutory
claims?
justice
antonin
scalia
on...
on
what
basis?
i
don't
understand
it.
certainly
in
the
text
of
the
jurisdictional
statute,
there's
no
such
distinction.
what...
what
is
the
basis
for
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
that
explains
all
of
these
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
did
congress...
surely
congress
did
not
expect
any
pronouncement
of...
of
title
by
the
federal
government
to
be
immune
from
challenge
by
private
individuals.
if
congress
did
not
anticipate
that
a
wrongful
assertion
of
title
through
the
federal
government
could
be
challenged
by
a
state
action
of
this
sort
to
clear
title,
how
did
congress
expect
it
ever
to
be
challenged?
i
mean,
i
can't
imagine
how
else
you...
you
would
attack
somebody
who...
who
claims
that
he
has
federal
title.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what...
is...
how
does
that
differ
from
what
happened
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
is
that
not
precisely
what
congress
expected?
did
not
congress,
in
fact,
approve
this
manner
of
challenging
the
asserted
federal
title?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
you...
you
have
to
acknowledge
there
are
at
least
three
situations
then:
number
one,
where
congress
did
not
create
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
did
not
expect
that
the
states
would
create
a
cause
of
action
to
vindicate
or
challenge
the
asserted
federal
interest;
number
two,
where
congress
did
create
a...
a
federal
cause
of
action;
and
number
three,
falling
between
the
two
where
congress
did
not
create
a
federal
cause
of
action
but,
in
the
nature
of
things,
must
have
anticipated
that
there
would
be
state
causes
of
action
resting
upon
the
federal
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
was
that
a
middle
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
would
not
have
necessarily
anticipated
that
the
states
would
glom
onto
a
federal
criterion
for
purposes
of
their
state...
of
their
state
tort
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whereas
here,
congress
must
have
anticipated
that
quiet
title
actions
of
this
sort
would
be
brought.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
except
the...
except
you
sort
of
abandon
that
for
constitutional
questions
for
some
inexplicable
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
it's
an
explicable
reason
to
distinguish
other
earlier
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
doesn't
require
construction,
but...
but
what
if
there
is
a
factual
controversy?
suppose
there
is
a
factual
controversy
as
to
whether
notice
was
given
and
notice
is
required
under
the
federal
statute.
does...
does
that
factual
controversy
with
regard
to
an
essential
element
of...
of
federal
law
make
it
a
federal
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
doesn't
present
any
question
of
law,
just
a
question
of
fact.
let's
say
both
parties
agree
about
the
law,
but
the
fact
that
is
determinative
of
nothing,
except
the
operation
of
federal
law,
is
at
issue.
now,
that...
that
would
normally...
under
1331,
you'd
be
able
to
come
into
federal
court
i
suppose
just
where
your
only
dispute
is
a
factual
dispute,
but
it
is
a
factual
dispute
regarding
the
operation
of
federal
law.
what...
what
if
this
were
just
a
factual
dispute
about
the
operation
of
federal
law?
what
would
we
do
with
it?
does
the
fact
that
it's
a
factual
dispute
make
it
not
substantial,
not
a
substantial
federal
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
happens
pretty
often
in
removal...
in...
in
removed
cases.
you
really
don't
know
what
the
defense
is
going
to
be.
if
it's
removed
on
the
basis
of
the
well-pleaded
complaint,
when
the
defense
gets
there,
it...
it
may
often
be
a
state...
a
state
defense.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
this...
this
problem
is
simply
a
consequence
of
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we...
we
altered
that
rule,
it
would
make
more
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
this...
this
kind
of
peculiarity
happens
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
whether
the
federal
question
has
to
be
pleaded
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
quick
and
dirty.
we
haven't
tried
to
slice
the
baloney
too
thin
in
this
area,
have
we?
we...
we--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
enough
to
be
pretty
close.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
a
fact
in
a
particular
case
which
affects
nobody
else
in
the
country,
but
which
is
determinative
of
the
federal
question
is
never
a
substantial
question
of
federal
law.
is
it?
so
you...
you
would
not
agree
that...
that
it's
not
only
the...
the
content,
but
also
the
application
of
federal
law
that's--
