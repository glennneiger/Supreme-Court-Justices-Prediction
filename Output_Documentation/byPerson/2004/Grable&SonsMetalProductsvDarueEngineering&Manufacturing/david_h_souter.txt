david
h.

haven't
we...
haven't
we
got
something
equally
different
here?
the...
the
issue
here,
as
i
understand
it,
is...
is
not
litigation
of
the
state
law
claim,
but
a
claim
under
federal
law
with
respect
to
the
passage
of
title
when
property
is
taken
for
taxes.
as
i
understand
the...
the
original
plaintiff's
claim,
it
simply
is
that
if
he's
right,
under
federal
law
he
is
entitled
to
a
declaration
that
the
property
is
still
his.
if
he's
wrong,
the
other
side
is
entitled
to
property.
but
the
issue
is
a
federal
issue,
and
the
only
way
the
state
has
a
role
in
it
is
that
the
state
provides
a
mechanism,
the
quiet
title
action,
analogous
maybe
to
1983,
for
getting
it
into
a
state
court.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
is
a
federal
issue,
not
as
in
merrell
dow,
a...
a
state
cause
of
action
that
incorporates
by
reference
a
federal
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
don't...
i
guess
that's
where
we're
parting
company.
i
don't
see
that
there
is
a
state
law
claim
as
distinct
from
a
state
law
procedure
for
trying
that
claim
in
a
state
court.
as
i...
as
i
said
a
second
ago,
it's
sort
of
like
1983.
it
doesn't
create
causes
of
action,
but
it
provides
a...
a
jurisdictional
basis
for
getting
into
court
if
you've
got
a
cause
of
action.
and
in
this
case,
it's
a
federal
cause.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
was
a
federal
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
we
could
leave
the...
the
kansas
city
formulation,
the
oral
laws,
intact
and
say
that
the
distinguish...
that
the
distinction
between
merrell
dow
and
this
case,
which
leaves
it
intact
is
the
distinction
between
in
merrell
dow's
case,
the
adoption
by
the
state
of
a
federal
standard,
though
the
state
did
not
have
to
adopt
it
in
its
tort
law,
purely
optional,
and
in
this
case,
the
application
of
federal
law
which,
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
state
had
absolutely
no
choice
but
to
apply.
if
we
recognize
that
distinction,
we
could
leave
the
language
in
kansas
city
exactly
where
it
is,
couldn't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
are
the...
sort
of
the...
the
horribles
that
you
have
in
mind?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
in...
in
that
case,
the
action
is
not
enforcing
the
federal
tax
law,
whereas
in
this
case,
the
action
is,
indeed,
enforcing
the
passage
of
title
statute
under
the...
under
the
tax
code.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
federal
law
is
determinative.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
taking
the...
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
you're
taking
the
position
then,
as
i
understand
it...
and
i...
i
don't
disagree
with
your...
your
position
necessarily...
that
its
construction
or
application--
justice
david
h.
souter
--of
federal
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
second
opinion
that
i
have
to
announce
this
morning
is
in
the
case
of
grable
v.
darue.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
internal
revenue
service
seized
real
estate
belonging
to
the
petitioner,
grable
for
unpaid
federal
taxes
and
sold
it
to
the
respondent,
darue.
grable
brought
a
state
quiet
title
action
in
state
court
against
darue
claiming
that
grable
still
had
good
title
to
its
old
property.
this
claim
of
superior
title
turned
however,
on
whether
the
internal
revenue
service
in
seizing
grable's
property
and
selling
it
to
darue
had
complied
with
all
the
requirements
set
out
in
the
federal
tax
law.
darue
removed
the
case
to
federal
court
because
he
said
the
case
arose
under
federal
law
and
for
that
reason
could
be
in
the
federal
court.
the
district
and
circuit
courts
found
that
although
state
law
provided
the
cause
of
action,
grable's
claims
still
did
arise
under
federal
law
because
it
turned
on
the
meaning
of
the
federal
tax
statute.
because
those
courts
held
that
the
claim
arose
under
federal
law,
they
held
that
it
could
be
removed
from
state
court
to
the
federal
court
for
trial.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
question
whether
a
state
law
claim
can
ever
arise
under
federal
law
if
as
here
congress
has
not
provided
a
federal
cause
of
action.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
and
reaffirm
the
long
established
rule
that
a
state
law
claim
requiring
the
resolution
of
a
disputed
and
substantial
question
of
federal
law
can
arise
under
federal
law
and
be
heard
in
a
federal
court
as
long
as
exercise
in
federal
jurisdiction
is
consistent
with
congressional
intent.
this
claim
which
requires
resolving
an
important
issue
of
federal
law
passes
the
test.
the
argument
in
this
case
has
centered
on
our
earlier
decision
in
merrell
dow
v.
thompson
where
we
held
that
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction
over
a
state
negligence
claim
arising
from
the
violation
of
a
federal
standard,
and
we
stressed
that
congress
had
no
provided
a
federal
cause
of
action
to
enforce
this
standard.
we
reach
that
conclusion
because
the
alternative
would
have
led
in
a
whole
other
state
law
claim
into
federal
court
even
the
widespread
adoption
of
federal
standards
as
evidence
of
negligence
under
state
law.
that
would
have
been
a
sweeping
result
inconsistent
with
congress'
failure
to
welcome
those
many
claims
with
a
private
federal
right
of
action.
while
grable
also
lacks
a
federal
private
right
of
action,
jurisdiction
here
does
not
go
further
than
cogress'
ambivalence
allows.
because
it
is
the
rare
state
quiet
title
action
that
involves
a
contested
issue
of
federal
law
as
a
result
and
given
the
important
federal
issues
that
the
case
presents,
there
is
no
reason
to
share
it
from
exercising
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
