justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
at
all
possible
to
do
here
what
has
been
done
in
the
union
cases,
where...
i
mean,
it's
pretty
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
there
aren't...
that
meat...
that
cattle
growers
don't,
by
and
large,
like
beef.
i
mean,
maybe
they
have
a
ideological
objection
to
people
eating
beef,
but
i
doubt
it.
they
probably
object
to
some
content.
so
can
you
segregate
that?
i
mean,
in
the
union
cases,
the
bar
cases,
they
try
to
segregate
where
there
really
is
an
ideological
objection
from
the
cases
where
really
all
that
the
objector
wants
is
not
to
pay
the
money.
and
so
they
work
out
a
system.
you
know,
you
pay
so
much
for
your
dues
anyway,
you
just
don't
pay
that
pro
rata
amount,
where
you
really
have
an
ideological
objection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
possible
to
work
that
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but,
i
mean,
if
you
make
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--totally
voluntary,
what
you're
going
to
discover
is,
all
of
a
sudden,
the
beef
people,
rather
than
write
a
check,
will
say,
"oh,
you
know,
i
make...
i
raise
cattle,
but
i
don't
think
people
should
eat
beef.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
saves
them
the
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
tend
to
doubt
that
that's
their
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
some
may
view...
object
to
certain
content.
so
i'm
asking
if
it's
feasible
to
work
out--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what's
the
objection
to,
whenever
you
have
an
ad,
you
put
a
little
thing
in
the
corner,
and
it
says,
"this
advertisement
is
paid
for
by
the
beef
industry
under
a
regulation,
x-23,
of
the
department
of
agriculture?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
wouldn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--tough,
would
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
you'd
have
to
do
is
have
a
little
thing...
and
it
would
just
say,
"usda
requires
this,
under
the
program.
"
and
then
the
whole
problem
goes
away.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
let's
be
honest
about
it.
let's
be
totally
accurate.
it's
not
going
to
say,
"the
government
believes
this".
the
government
may
not
believe
it.
what
it
says
is,
"this
message
is
brought
to
you
by
the
beef
association
under
the...
under
a
program
requiring
contributions
to
advertising
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nobody
will
even
know
what
that
means,
but
it
has
the--
[laughter]
--it
has--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
has
the
virtue
of
being
totally
accurate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
important
thing
is,
you
have
no
objection
to
doing
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
would
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--seems
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
understand
that
a
person
could
have
an
ideological
objection
to
the
content
of
the
ad.
but
the
ad,
itself,
is
an
effort
by
government,
in
this
area,
to
regulate
a
commercial
matter,
not
a
license
plate
that
says,
"free
speech,
or
die",
or
"freedom"--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah,
i
know.
right
now
i'm
asking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
my
question
is,
does
it
make
a
difference
for
the
point
of
distinguishing,
or
not
distinguishing,
99
percent
of
the
way
it's
carried
out,
has
to
do
with
simple
advertising,
commercial
advertising,
the
regulation
of
a
commercial
matter,
commerce--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
no
legal
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
other
words--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
other
words,
a
program
that
is
a
regulatory
program
regulating
commerce,
we
should
no
longer
think
of
that,
though
we
tend
to
think
of
it
as
quite
different
in
the
way
we
approach
the
first
amendment...
we
no
longer,
in
your
view,
should?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
regulate
advertising.
we
regulate
commercial
advertising.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
federal
trade
commission--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
didn't
say
they
had
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--commercial
objection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
asking.
in
analyzing
the
program,
there
are
some
things
for
it,
and
there
are
some
things
against
it.
and
in
trying
to
make
that
weighing,
i
do
think
it's
different,
because
the
basis
of
the
program
is
commercial
regulation.
and
so
i
want
to
be
certain,
in
your
view,
that's
either
correct
or
incorrect.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
incorrect,
i
want
to
know
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
does
it
make
a
difference?
if
it
makes
a
difference,
then
the
lens
that
i
look
at
this
through
is
called
our...
whatever
the
second-tier
commercial
speech
lends.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
looked
at--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know,
but
take
all
that
out
of
it...
take
all
that
out
of
it,
and
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
and
justice
souter?
that
is,
look,
like
this,
you
have
an
organization,
the
federal
trade
commission,
say,
or
that
the
fda
says,
on
the
one
hand,
(a)
broccoli
industry,
"fruits
and
vegetables
are
good
for
you;
crib
death
device.
"
buy
anti-crib-death
devices;
"buy
car
seats
for
your
children.
"
or,
"don't
smoke";
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"#
don't
buy
a
crib
without
a
crib-death
device--
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"#
or
a
car
without
a
car
seat.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see?
one's
negative
and
one's
positive.
and
everything
else
is
the
same.
then
how
do
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
maybe
it
doesn't
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
not
interested...
i
got
that
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
dismissing
it.
i
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
not
sure--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
my
question
is,
is
it
implied
in
what
you're
argued
that
it
would
be
equally
unconstitutional,
in
the
same
way,
to
tell
the
cigarette
industry
to
advertise,
"don't
smoke",
or
to
tell
the
automobile
industry
to
advertise,
"buy
car
seats
for
your
children.
"
or
to
tell
the
crib
industry
to
advertise,
"be
sure
you
have
an
anti-crib-death
device?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
all
that,
assuming
the
financing
is
the
same
as
here,
everything
else
the
same,
is
it
implicit
in
your
argument
that
they're
all
equally
unlawful?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
think
the
question,
or
at
least
the
version
i
have
of
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is,
we
have
this
case,
exactly,
and
the
only
difference
is,
instead
of
getting
these
people
to
eat...
say,
"eat
beef",
what
they
say
do
is,
they
get
people
together
and
say,
"don't
eat
too
much
beef".
i
put--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--"too
much",
because
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--makes
it
more
realistic.
all
right,
now,
does
it
suddenly
become
constitutional?
