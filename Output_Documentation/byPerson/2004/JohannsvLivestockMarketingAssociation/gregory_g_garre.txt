mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
amendment
does
not
prevent
the
government
from
speaking
out
in
order
to
revise
and
expand
the
market
for
the
nation's
most
important
agricultural
product.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yeah.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
kennedy--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
kennedy,
the
assessments
in
this
case
are
imposed
on
a
class
of
people
who
sell
particular
commodity...
cattle.
in
that
respect,
they're
no
different
than
the
types
of
assessments
the
federal
government
has
been
imposing
for
centuries
on
the
sale
of
commodities,
from
the
first
tax
the
federal
government
imposed
on
whiskey
to
the
excise
taxes
on
gasoline
producers
today.
and
respondents
concede
you
could
do
this
out
of
general
tax
revenues.
they
concede
that
you
could
have
a
government
speech
program
funded
by
excises
on
certain
commodities,
like
cigarettes
or
alcohol.
there
is
no
basis
under
the
first
amendment
to
carve
out
a
different
rule
in
the
case
of
beef.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
we
agree
with
the
government
speech
doctrine,
although
we
also
think
that
the
court
can
uphold
the
statute
under
the
intermediate-scrutiny
analysis.
it
makes
perfect
sense
for
the
government
to
be
speaking
out
in
order
to
correct
a
market
problem
that
congress
identified
in
the
midst
of
a
two-decade-long
depression
in
the
beef
industry.
take
the
bse
incident
last
year.
bse
imposes
a
potentially
catastrophic
and
overnight
impact
on
the
beef
industry.
in
response
to
that
threat,
because
of
the
beef
checkoff
program,
the
government
was
able
to
respond
immediately
with
the
funds
necessary
to
respond
on
a
national
scale,
not
only
through
promotion...
and
this
is
an
important
part
in
which
this
case
is
different
from
united
food...
only
about
half
of
every
checkoff
dollar
goes
to
promoting
beef
through
commercial
advertising,
like
the
"beef,
it's
what's
for
dinner.
"
campaign.
the
rest
of
that
dollar
goes
to
things
like
producing
information
to
consumers
about
the
safety
of
u.s.
meat,
the...
addressing
the
health
concerns
imposed
by
bse
and
other
potential
diseases,
like
e.
coli;
going
to
open
up
foreign
markets
so
that
we
can
export
beef...
beef
exports
have
risen
dramatically
under
this
program...
and
going
for
things
like
research
in
order
to
identify
an
early-detection
system
for
bse.
in
united
foods,
this
court
emphasized,
at
least
three
times
throughout
its
opinion,
that
the
only
aspect
of
the
program
that
was...
the
dollar
was
being
collected
for
was
commercial
advertising.
and,
justice
stevens,
i
think
you
emphasized
that
in
your
concurrence,
as
well.
and
this
program
is
much
more--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
the
union--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
certainly
saving
half
is
better
than
scuttling
the
whole--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--thing,
justice
scalia.
but
the
union
case
is...
the
speech
that
was...
that
this
court
held
could
not
be
funded...
and,
after
all,
in
those
cases,
the
message
was
controlled
by
a
non-government
entity,
the
union
or
the
state
bar.
but
there,
you're
talking
about
political
and
ideological
speech.
here,
we're
talking
about
beef
production...
producing--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
breyer,
the
program
would
do
that
if
this
court
held
it
was
necessary--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
correct.
but
let
me
make
a
few
additional--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--points.
first,
as
mr.
kneedler
emphasized,
nothing
in
the
statute,
the
regulation,
requires
the
ad
to
say
that
they're
funded
by
america's
beef--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
let
me
make
another--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
government
isn't
hiding
from--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
messages
in
its
pro-beef
ads.
it...
justice
souter,
the
government
could
do
that,
but
it's
not
hiding
from
this
message.
we
think
that
if
the
court--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
the
government
does
do
that,
justice
souter.
last
year,
during
the
height
of
bse
crisis,
the
president,
from
his
ranch
in
texas,
urged
americans
to
eat
more
beef
and
told
americans
that
beef
was
safe.
that's
the
same
message
that
went
out,
supervised
by
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture,
through
the
beef
board,
to
communicate--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--message.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
president's
message
was
paid
through
general
tax
dollars.
the
message
under
this
program
is
paid
through
the
assessment.
it's
the
same
message.
the
message
under
the
beef
board
is
carefully
controlled
and
supervised
by
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture.
if
i
could
make
a
point--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
that's
good.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
every
single
ad
that
we're
aware
of,
has
the
beef
check,
which
is
the
sign
that
the
beef...
or
the
reasonable
observer
would
know
that
this
is
a
statute
passed
by
congress
containing
a
message
that
americans
should
eat
more
beef,
that
beef
is
nutritious,
that's
disseminated
under
a
program
that's
carefully
supervised
and
controlled
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
would
not,
but
we
also
think...
and
if
the
court
made
that
clear
in
this
case,
it
wouldn't
be
a
basis
for
invalidating
the
statute;
it
might
be
a
basis
for
sending
it
back
or
an
as-applied
challenge.
importantly,
we--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it...
we
don't
think
it's
a
misrepresentation.
the
speech
is
funded
by
america's
beef
producers.
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
centerpiece
of
their
first
amendment
argument--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--with
respect,
we
would
disagree.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
a
reasonable
observer
would
think
that
just
because
an
ad
says
it's
funded
by
the
nation's
beef
producers,
every
single
one
of
the
850,000
individual
cattle
producers
in
this
country
agrees
with
every
single--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--of
the
message.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
think
it's
fair
to
assume,
as
the
court
would
under
the
establishment
clause,
that
they're
familiar
with
the
act
of
congress
that
makes
it...
this
message,
as
well
as
the
program.
a
critical
point
on
this
attribution
argument
is
that
it's
not
supported
by
any
single
piece
of
evidence
that
respondents,
themselves,
have
put
into
the
record
in
this
case.
their
first
amendment
objection
is
to
the
content
of
the
ad.
there's
not
a
single
piece
of
evidence
in
the
record
purporting
to
make
this
attribution
argument
that
the
public
would
attribute
to
the
ads
to
them.
it's
not
in
the
complaint
in
this
case,
it's
not
in
their
own
affidavits,
it's
not
in
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
highly
doubt
that,
justice
souter,
because
the
first
amendment
claim
was
added
in
response
to
the
united
foods
case,
and
this
case
was
developed,
from
the
outset,
on
a
government
speech
theory.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but
it...
the
case
was
tried
under
the
first
amendment,
under
a
government
speech
argument.
but...
so
the
fact
that
respondents
didn't
put--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
correct.
but
my
point
is
that
the
first
amendment
case
proceeded
after
united
foods.
the
government's
central
argument
in
the
trial
was
government
speech.
the
one
time
attribution
came
up...
and
this
is
at
pages
46
and
47
of
the
trial
record...
respondents'
own
witness
testified
that
the
public
was
not
likely
to
attribute
the
message
of
the
pro-beef
ad
to
its
organization
of
beef
producers.
so
if
the
court
finds
that
attribution
is
a
constitutional
concern,
it's
no
basis
to
bring
down
the
act
of
congress
on
the
record
in
this
case.
the...
i
want
to
emphasize,
if
i
could,
that
the
program
in
this
case
has
been
effective.
the
record
establishes
that
the
beef
checkoff
has
had
a
statistically
significant
impact
on
increasing
consumer
demand
for
beef
and
an
increase
in
prices.
that's
contained
in
the
expert
testimony
of
professor
ward,
at
pages
100
and
173.
the
record
also
shows
that
for
every
checkoff
dollar
spent
on
the
program,
there's
more
than
a
5.67
rate
of
return
back
to
the
beef
producers
in
the
form
of
increased
prices
for
cattle.
the
beef
board's
2003
report
suggests...
finds
that
the
price
of
a
fed
steer
increased
by
more
than
$200
in
the
past
few
years.
this
program
has
worked.
thank
you
very
much.
