well,
but
if
you...
if
you
say
the
act
can
be...
say,
because
this
is
just
an
as-applied
challenge,
you're
asking
us
to
assume
that
we
can
put
on
a
label
that's
not
true,
"this
message
is
brought
to
you
by
your
friendly
department
of
agriculture.
"
that
isn't
accurate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you're
having
us
save
the
statute
by
just
putting
a
label
on
it
that
isn't
accurate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
be...
in
the
union
cases,
it's
hard
enough.
it's
a...
the
good-of-the-order
exception
is
the
way
it
works
in
the
union.
and
in
the
bar
thing,
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
is
a
question
perhaps
more
for
the
respondent
than
for
you,
but
i
would
like
your
comment
on
it.
suppose
the
statute
were
changed
and
there
was
a
dollar-a-head
assessment
on
beef,
and
it
just
went
into
the
general
funds
of
the
united
states
treasury,
and
then
they
used
part
of
that
money...
they
had
more
money
for
beef
advertising,
and
the
government
did
the
advertising.
what
would
the
respondents
say
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
can't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why
can't
you
just
do
that?
or
is
your
answer
to
me,
"well,
then,
it's
just
formalism,
and
you
might
as
well
rule
for
me
now?
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
can't
the
government--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why
can't
the
government
adopt
my
solution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
put
into
the
general
fund
of
the...
of
the
treasury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
you'd
come
within
the
protections
of
frothingham
versus
mellon,
and
massachusetts
versus
mellon,
if
you
did
it
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
you
could--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--probably
restructure
this
act
to
get
to
the
result
you
want.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
can
just
continue
on
government
speech,
because
that's
where--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--where
we
left
off.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
something
offensive
about
making
a
particular
portion
of
the
public
pay
for
something
that
the
government
says.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
ought
to
be
out
of
the
general
fund.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
i'm
saying,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
speech
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
advance
your
argument
very
much,
because
it
has
problems
of
its
own.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
was
an
individual
attribution.
you,
yourself,
had--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--had
to
carry
this
message.
now,
here
you
want
us
to
think
of
some
cowboy--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--going
into
the
bar,
and
he
gets
jeered
by
all
his
friends
because
he
likes
beef.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
odd
that
you
can
be
compelled
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--engage
in
speech
that
you
don't
agree
with.
now
you're
saying
that
the
more--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--disagreeable
it
is
to
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
more
legitimate
it
is.
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
very
strange
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
in
this
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
take
it,
it
would
be
okay
if
the
beef
producers
had
to
use
a
dollar
a
head
to
put,
"eating
too
much
beef
is
dangerous
to
your
health.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
cattle,
then--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
goes
back
to
frothingham
and
mellon,
and
massachusetts
versus
mellon,
and
united
states
versus
butler,
where
we
could
trace
the
amount.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
old
stuff.
