justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
rust
did
not...
rust
was
not
a
case
in
which
the
doctor
was
saying,
"this
is
my
personal
opinion,
not
the
government's.
"
and
here,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
there
is
an
affirmative
effort
to
say,
"this
is...
this
is
paid
for
by.
"
whatever
it's
called,
the
cattlemen's
group
or
the
beef
group,
which
affirmatively
indicates
that
it's
not
government
speech.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
accurate--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
it
also
contains
the
implication
that
who...
he
who
pays
is
the
person
whose
speech
is
being
broadcasted.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
we
realize
that.
i
mean,
we're
getting
into
it
because
there's
at
least
a
potential
constitutional
problem
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
you
respond
to
justice
breyer's
question,
would
you
go
the
step
further
and
say,
why
isn't
one
possible
solution
to
this
difficulty
we're
having
about
government
speech
a
requirement
that
if
you
want
to
justify
it
as
government
speech,
you
put
in
the
advertisement,
"this
is
the
government's
position,
paid
for
by
the
beef
producers?
"
justice
david
h.
souter
no--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
fact,
there
was
an
indication
in
the
brief
that
the
government
had
taken
the
position
that
if
the
government
came
out
front
and
said,
"hey,
we're
urging
you
to
eat
more
meat.
"
that,
in
fact,
it
would
be
very
unsuccessful
in
doing
it.
it
seems
to
want
to
hide
the
ball
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
he--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
who
paid
for
that?
did
beef
people
pay
for
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
it...
what
it
would...
what
it
would
be
a
basis
for,
at
least
within
the
confines
of
this
argument,
would
be
a
basis
for
your
government
speech
claim
in
the
sense
that
you
wouldn't
be
basing
a
government
speech
claim
on
what
is
really
a
misrepresentation.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
including
those
who
don't
want
to
fund
it
and
who
don't
agree
with
the
message.
i
mean,
the
problem
here
is
that
by
making
that
representation,
you
indicate
that
this
is
the
message
of
the
people
who
are
paying
for
it.
and
some
of
the
people
who
are
paying
for
it
do
not
wish
to
convey
that
message.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
misrepresentation.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
they
would--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
they
would,
i
think,
assume
is
that,
in
the
name,
the
beef
producers
do,
in
fact,
agree
with
this,
and
this
is
their
message.
what
they
would
not
assume
from
it
is
that
it
is
what
you
and
mr.
kneedler
are
claiming,
the
speech
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
they
certainly
wouldn't
infer
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe--
justice
david
h.
souter
--maybe
it's
not
because
they
didn't
know
you
were
going
to
be
defending
on
the
basis
of
government
speech.
that's
what's
getting
us
into
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
wasn't
a
government
speech
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
doesn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
understand
that
you
have
a
first
amendment
claim,
which
you're
going
to
have
even
if
we
say,
"this
is
not
government
speech".
i
think
the
whole
point
here
is
to
decide
whether
this
is
even--
justice
david
h.
souter
--an
issue
that
should
be
disposed
of
on
any
grounds
other
than
candor.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what's
the
difference
between
the
checkoff
and
the
excise
tax?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
answer
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--where--
justice
david
h.
souter
--where
the
money
goes
and
who
pays
out
the
money
for
the
ad,
that's
the
difference.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that
the...
isn't
that
the
essential
difference
between
the
structure
in
this
case
and
the
structure
in
the
case
in
which
the
government
comes
out,
saying,
"this
is
your
government,
saying,
"don't
smoke".
"
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
consider
this
theory.
the
congress
passes
an
excise
tax.
it
happens
to
be
a
dollar
head,
on
the
cattle,
just
like
this
so-called
"checkoff".
and
the
government
uses
the
excise
tax
revenue
to
finance
advertising,
saying...
maybe
saying,
"eat
more
beef",
maybe
advertising,
saying,
"don't
eat
quite
so
much".
justice
david
h.
souter
first
amendment
problem--
justice
david
h.
souter
--including
excise.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
just
want
to
know
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--your
position
is.
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
position
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
then--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
then
it
does
not
have--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
not
a
first
amendment
problem.
it
does
not
have
the
objection
that
you're
raising.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
one
of
your
reasons,
which
was
that
they
are
being
singled
out
to
pay
for
this?
they're
being
singled
out
to
pay
for
it
in
the
excise
tax
situation.
do
you
come
to
different
answers,
depending
whether
it's
excise
tax
or
singled
out
without
excise
tax,
based,
essentially,
on
the
ground
that
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
we
simply
cannot
look
behind
the
expenditure
of
tax
revenue?
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--don't
you
go
back
to
the
answer
you
gave
me?
sure,
when
taxes
are
involved,
there
may
be
an
under-inclusive
enforcement
of
certain
individual
rights,
but
they
have
to
be
under-enforced,
because,
otherwise,
you
simply
cannot
administer
a
tax
structure.
