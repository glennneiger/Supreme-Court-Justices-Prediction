mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
was
listening
to
some
of
the
questions
about
whether
it
would
solve
the
problem
to
be
more
candid
and
say,
"this
is
your
government
speaking",
i
thought
i
would
begin
with
that
question,
rather
than
with
an
overview
of
government
speech.
you'll
recall
wooley
v.
maynard,
of
course,
in
which
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
without
sensing
the
irony
of
its
position,
said,
"we'll
put
you
in
jail
if
you
do
not
say,
"live
free
or
die"
on--
"
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--"your
license
plates".
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
justice
kennedy,
my--
[laughter]
--my
point...
my
point
was
going
to
be
that
a
footnote
on
the
license
plate
saying,
"this
is
new
hampshire
speaking",
would
not
have
helped.
but
one
of
the
central
holdings,
as
i
understood
it,
of
united
foods,
independent
of
government
speech,
was
that
although
there
is
a
difference
between
having
to
say
something
yourself,
having
to
put
it
on
your
car,
and
having
to
pay
for
it,
that
difference
does
not
go
to
the
existence
of
a
first
amendment
speech
objection...
not
an
association
objection,
but
a
speech
objection.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yeah,
i
don't--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
scalia,
i
think,
although
it's
an
interesting
digression
about
whether
the
government
is
being
candid,
the
objection
here
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
being
the
government--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
may
be.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
it
must
identify
itself,
but
it
doesn't
help,
because--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
government--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
no,
justice--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
souter,
i
think
that
we're
getting
off
track
by
assuming
that
it
helps
for
it
to
be
government
speech.
my
point
is
that
a
central
theme
of
this--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--let
me--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
but--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
let
me
ask
you
whether--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
depends
on
the
purpose
for
which
you
are
acting
whether
it's
government
speech.
in
rust
v.
sullivan,
even
though
i
think
you're
certainly
right,
justice
scalia,
that
in
that
opinion
it
wasn't
called
government
speech,
in
order
to
rationalize
it,
in
rosenberger
and
velazquez,
it
was
so
described.
but
the
question
there
wasn't,
"can
people
be
made
to
support
it?
"
the
question,
rather,
was,
"can
the
government
insist
on
staying
within
the
terms
of
its
grants
and
saying
you
can't
talk
about
abortion?
"
when
the
question
is,
"can
the
government
force
you
to
support
it.
"
the
"it",
if
it's
government
speech,
doesn't
help.
the
first
amendment
makes
it
a
harder
case
for
them,
not
easier.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--of
course.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
the
court
has
said
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
being
singled
out,
as
in
wooley,
to
have
a
licence
plate,
as
in
pruneyard,
to
have
someone
on
your
premises.
in
pruneyard,
the
court
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
it's
okay
to
require
someone
to
allow
a
private
speaker
onto
the
premises
is
that
he
was
not
required
to
support
a
government
slogan.
when
it
is--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--government
speech--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
was
true
of--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
was
true
of
united
foods.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
o'connor,
i
would
be
much
more
offended
by
having
to
put
it
in
my
license
plate.
but
if
i
were
raising
cattle,
and
i
were
told,
as
they
were
told
in
this
case,
"cattle
equals
beef;
that's
all
it's
worth,
and
that's
why
we
won't
let
you,
in
these
ads...
we
won't
let
the
ads,
that
you
have
to
pay
for,
increase
the
demands
for
cattle;
only
beef--
"
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
haven't
made
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
oh,
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
most
important
distinction--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
if
it--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--wasn't
generic...
there's
no
way
for
them
to
have
an
ad
for
every
imaginable
different
kind
of
cattle
in
one
set
of
advertisements.
i
just
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it's
a--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
we
would
object,
fundamentally,
if
they
did
not
emphasize
american
beef.
that
was
our
first
objection.
they
said
that
they
don't
want
to
emphasize
american
beef,
because,
in
cross-examination,
the
officer
of
the
beef
board
said,
"consumers
might
actually
have
a
preference
for
american
beef.
"
"that
would
be
irrational.
"
"we
don't
want
that.
"
and
so
all
of
those
cattle
ranchers
can
say
that,
"we're
proud
of
it
being
american.
"
they
can't
get
that
in
there.
and
the
other
principal
thing
is
that
they
don't
think
of
themselves
as
selling
sides
of
beef.
some
of
them
are
selling
dairy
cattle,
some
of
them
are
selling...
even
if
it's
going
to,
in
the
end,
be
in
the
slaughterhouse...
we
all
die
someday...
their
fundamental
belief
is
that
these
are
animals,
and
they're
to
be
cared
for.
and
the
reason
that
that
makes
a
difference...
the
reason
that
it
makes
a
difference
is,
they
can't
even
advertise...
try
to
make
live
cattle
more
attractive
to
buy...
is
that
the
collective-action
problem,
if
that
were
relevant
here...
i
think
that
was
really
resolved
by
united
foods...
but
the
collective-action
problem
is
really
created,
not
solved,
by
what
they're
doing.
because
the
structure
of
the
market
is
that
there
are
a
few
concentrated
meat-packers.
something
like
four
slaughter
80
percent
of
the...
of
the
cattle
in
the
united
states.
they
have
the
bargaining
power.
and
in
the
record,
their
support
for
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
that
when
the
demand
for
beef
goes
up
through
these
generic
ads
saying,
"eat
beef"...
although
they
certainly
don't
say,
"your
government
says
you
should
eat
beef,
beef,
beef.
"
--but
when
the
demand
for
beef
goes
up,
the
profit
is
pocketed
by
the
meat
processor,
the
meat
packer,
the
restaurant,
the
supermarket.
and
these
guys
still
end
up
taking
their
cattle
to
market,
and
often
having
to
pay
a
dollar
checkoff,
even
though
they
can't
even
get
the
price
of
the...
of
the
cattle
back.
so--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
free
rides
are
now
taken
by
the
people
who
don't
pay--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
it
regulates
speech,
justice
breyer.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
don't--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
it
makes
an
emotional
difference.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
not
in
the
context
of
forcing
people
to
pay.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
makes
a
difference--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
no.
i
think,
certainly
if
we
are
regulating
economic
transactions
and
only
dealing
with
speech
in
a
purely
ancillary
way...
that
is,
we're
regulating
sale,
transaction--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right,
but
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--network--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--didn't
you
say
that
just
the
fact
that
you
call
it
commercial
speech
only
means
that
when
you
are
regulating
problems
of
a
transactional
kind...
deception,
overbearing...
then
the
fact
that
it's
commercial
speech
makes
a
big
difference.
but
you
can't
just
generically
say
that
because
something
doesn't
fit
your
idea
of
what's
ideological...
i
mean,
to
these
ranchers,
the
ideology--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--is
different--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
whose--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--whose
line...
whose
line
between
ideology
and
commerce
will--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
it's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think
it's...
if
one
were
just
weighing
and
didn't
have
a
structured
set
of
principles
on
the
balance
in
favor
of
it,
i
think,
you're
right,
we
can't...
they're
not
trying
to
induce
ideological
conformity.
this
is
not
a
case
where
they're
trying
to
enforce
what
justice
jackson
calls
"the
unanimity
of
the
graveyard".
it
is
a
case
where
the
spirit
of
the
government
is
in
the
right
place.
the
government
is
trying
to
facilitate
collective
speech
when--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
don't
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
doesn't
follow.
i
don't
think
that
follows.
it
follows
that
if
you
were...
if
you
were
writing
on
a
clean
slate
and
were
trying
to
create
a
wholly
new
doctrine,
one
of
the
things
you
would
look
at,
i
suppose,
is
that
this
is
not
a
program
designed
to
create
ideological
conformity
in
america.
at
least
the
spirit
of
the
program
is
not
that.
but
the
road
to
hell
is
often
paved
with
good
intentions,
and
the
means,
in
this
case,
that
was
chosen,
was
not
to
have
the
government
spend
some
more
money
telling
people,
"beef
isn't
all
as
bad
for
you
as
you
think.
"
the
remedy
that
they
are
choosing
is
to
pick
a
group
of
ranchers
and
say
to
them,
"you
are
the
ones
who
are
going
to
pay,
and
you
are
going
to
pay
for--
"
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
"#
ads
that
are
in
your
name.
"
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
by
"advertisements
against
smoking",
justice
stevens,
if
you
mean,
"here
are
the
things
that
will
kill
you
in
cigarettes.
"
the
kind
of
thing
that's
on
the
package
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
constitutional,
under
even
cases
like
zauderer,
to
say
that
whoever
sells
a
product
or
a
service--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
no
one
suggests
that
the
cigarette
companies
are
supporting
the
ads
in
california.
california
is
doing
exactly
what
the
surgeon
general
does.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
say
negative
things--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
if
you're--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
it
may
be
strange,
but
i
think
that
there
have
been
stranger
things.
the
reason
that
it's
true
is
that
if
you
go
around
doing
things
that
might
endanger
people,
it's
entirely
justifiable
for
the
state,
as
part
of
its
non-speech
effort
to
protect
people--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--from
harm,
to
make
you
give
warnings--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think
that's
a
much
harder
case
than
this,
to
be
honest
with
you.
i
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
california
does
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
in
california,
it
does.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yeah.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--drastic
effect
would
be
the
other
way,
wouldn't
it?
if
this
court
were
to
hold,
despite
united
foods,
that
it
is
permissible
to
force
people
to
support
speech
they
don't
agree
with,
as
long
as
that
speech
doesn't
fit
our
sense
of
what's
ideological,
that
cuts
to
roll
back
keller
and
lehnert
and
abood.
it's
not
a
small
part
of
the
constitutional
landscape
that
would
be
unearthed.
whereas,
think
about
what
is
the
marginal
effect
of
saying--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
i
do
think
that
would
be
permissible.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
because,
i
mean,
technically,
it
would
solve
only
the
association
problem.
they're
not
associated
with
the
message.
they're
still
forced
to
support
it,
but
not
in
any
sense
different
from
general
taxpayers.
and
because
that's
the
case,
and
because
it
would
be
an
odd
formalism
to
say
that
it
makes
a
difference
whether
we
segregate
that
money
or
not,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
follow
that
if
the
government
is
willing
to
pay
the
political
cost
of
having
the
speech
be
perhaps
less
persuasive
because
of...
people
discount
what
the
government
says
and
of
having
to
get
an
appropriation
from
the
taxpayers...
i
mean,
taxpayers
are
smart
enough
to
know--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--like
the
lockbox?
i
mean,
every...
i
think
the
taxpayers
know
that
money
is
fungible.
well,
in
this
case,
you
mean
if
you
had
the
program,
not
from
general
revenue,
but
you
simply
said,
on
the
ad,
"this
is
actually
part
of
a
government
program?
"
i
don't
think
that
solves
any
problem,
other
than
deception.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
deception
is
the...
my
constitutional
argument.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
checkoff
in
this
case
is,
it's
money
that
goes
to
a
group,
which,
though
it
is
organized
by
the
government,
purports
to
represent--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
way
it
structured--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--these
people.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
difference
is
the
whole
structure.
keep
in
mind--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
one...
the
difference
is
that
in
one
case,
we've
got
congress,
we've
got
the
executive,
we
have
one--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--person,
one
vote.
here,
we
have
a
million--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
mean--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
mean,
i
think
it's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
whether
it's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--negative--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--or
positive,
it's
the
government--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
no,
it
matters,
in
this
sense.
when
the
government
puts
out
a
message
and
puts
its
credibility
behind
the
message,
likely
to
have
to
balance...
it's
going
to
say,
"a
little
broccoli,
but
a
little
steak.
"
"don't
risk
crib
death"--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
all
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
so
i'm
not
understanding
what
your
question
is.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
my
argument
is
that
you
can
require
the
seller
of
any
commodity
to
include
warnings.
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
you
can
say
to
an
industry,
"you're
bad
guys.
"
"we
want
you
to
put
on
an
advertising
campaign,
and
the
campaign
has
to
have
these
characteristics.
"
forcing
them
to
advocate
that
people
not
buy
their
products,
i
think,
is
not
the
same
thing--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--as
forcing
them
to
say--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
it
will
be
addictive
or
that
it
will
cause
cancer.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
so,
because
i
can't
see
any
difference
between
saying
that...
you
put
on
the
package,
"the
surgeon
general
has
determined
that
smoking
will
cause
cancer.
"
and
saying,
"we're
going
to
put
on
television--
"
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--"the
surgeon
general"--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
that...
justice
stevens,
what--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--what
is--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--what
is
the
difference
between
telling
them
that...
i
mean,
there
may
be
a
critical
difference
between
the
point
of
sale
and
a
generic
ad...
that
is,
the
power
to
regulate
the
transaction
to
make
sure
it's
safe,
including
the
power
to
include
on
the
package
certain
warnings.
the
moment
you
step
back
from
that
and
say
that,
"because
you're
in
a
dangerous
business,
you
have
to
publish
general
warnings
to
the
public.
"
maybe
that's
where
the
line
has
to
be
drawn,
because
i
agree
that
it
would
be
rather
bizarre--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think
that
the
rationale
for
that
would
be
far
stronger
than
this.
the
state's
power
to
protect
people,
in
terms
of
life
and
health,
includes
the
power
to
compel--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--okay.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
not
advocating;
reporting
what
the
government
position
is.
i
mean,
the...
when
the
cigarette
company
says
on
the
package,
"the
surgeon
general
has
found
this
stuff
is
deadly.
"
they're
not
quite
saying,
"we
agree
with
the
surgeon
general.
"
they've...
making
them
fund
or
support
statements
that
do
not
reflect
their
own
beliefs,
as
though
it
were--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--is
impermissible.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
if
they
had...
well,
they're
not
beef
producers.
i
mean,
i
am
troubled
by...
they're...
these
are
cattle.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
all
right?
and
then...
and
then
they're
trying,
ultimately,
to
brand
us
as
though
we
are
slicing
these
things
up
and
selling
them.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
the
question
is,
can
retail
grocers
be
required
to
put
on
the
beef
packages
they
sell,
"the
government
has
determined
that
the
cholesterol
content
is
dangerous
if
you
have
more
than
x.
"
i
see
no
reason
why
that
would
be
harder--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--to
defend
than
the
cigarette
package.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yeah.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
program
is
facially
unconstitutional.
it
is
the
structure
that
says
to
all
these
people,
"you've
got
to
put
money
into
this
elaborate
structure,
which
purports
to
represent
you.
"
--that
is,
the...
they
have
all
this
stuff
saying
that
the
beef
board
is
related
to
the
industry
as
board
of
directors,
the
shareholders...
"these
people,
who
purport
to
represent
you,
will,
under
the
aegis
of
the
government,
put
out
statements
at
various
times.
"
that's
facially
unconstitutional.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
or
maybe--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--talking
about
the
war
in
iraq.
no,
i
think
that
once
your
taxes
enter
the
general
fund,
the
pretense
that
it's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
don't
think
excise
taxes
are
segregated
in
any
way
that
makes...
that
makes
it
harder--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--than
social
security.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
my
position
is
that
once
the
revenue
is
part
of
the
government's
general
fund,
the
government's
subject
to
doctrines
that
i
don't
think
are
first
amendment
doctrines
about
government
propaganda...
there
may
be
limits
on
the
government's
ability--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--to
defend
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
subject
to
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it's
not
a
first
amendment
problem.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
the
structure
is
they
take
the
money
from
you
and
put
it
in
this
elaborate
machinery
which
comes
out
with
statements
you're
forced
to
support,
the
statements
that
don't
have
behind
them
the
accountability
checks
of
the
federal
government,
which
has
to
answer
to
taxpayers
and
answer
to
the
public
for
the
stuff
it
puts
out...
that
is...
if
that's
what
it
is,
it
doesn't
matter
what
you
call
it,
it
remains
unconstitutional.
it
remains
unconstitutional
because
these
individuals
are
forced
in
a
way
that
taxpayers
are
not...
forced
to
be
part
of
a
system
in
which,
even
if
you
have
footnotes
saying,
"this
is
pursuant
to
the
government.
"
a
system
in
which
they
will
be
generally
understood
in
just
the
way
justice
breyer
said,
"well,
you
know,
we
assume--
"
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
these
people--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
we're
going
to
eliminate
the
cattlemen's
beef
board
and
all
of
these
things--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
are
supposed
to
represent
you--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
would
be
happy
to
represent
the
cattlemen
in
that
circumstance,
saying,
"you
still
have
not
an
associational
right,
but
a
right
not
to
be
singled
out
to
support
government
speech.
"
but
it
would
be
a
different
and
more
difficult
claim.
one.
two,
this
court
doesn't
have
before
it
the
possibility
of
rewriting
all
of
this.
three,
there
was
a
severability
provision
in
an
earlier
version
of
the
law
suggesting
that
maybe
if
you
could
lop
something
off,
it
would
be
okay.
but
that
was
eliminated
in
the
current
law.
and,
finally,
any
attempts
to
analogize
this
to
the
cases
like
lehnert
and
keller,
in
terms
of
remedy,
that
maybe
we
can
create
some
scheme
where
only
the
objectionable
part
is
returned,
is
fundamentally
incoherent,
because
what
is
objectionable
here
is
homogenizing
all
of
these
people
into
some
one
message,
and
putting
it
out
through
this
elaborate
structure
that
purports
to
represent
them.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that
there's
a
point
beyond
which,
for
institutional
reasons,
it
would
be
very
problematic
for
courts
to
say
that
you
could
trace
the
dollars
into
the
treasury
and
those
institutional
reasons
would
be,
i
think,
an
instance
of
under-enforcement
of
a
constitutional
norm,
because
the
underlying
constitutional
principle
that
you
ought
not
to
be
able,
by
some
gimmick,
to
get
some
people
to
support
speech
they
don't
believe
in,
that
would
be
there.
but
the
difficulty
of
having
this
court
enforce
that
principle,
i
think,
would
be
very
real.
but
no
such
difficulty,
i
think,
is
presented
in
a
case
like
this
one,
because
if
this
case
came
out
their
way
because
of
government
speech,
of
course,
united
foods
would
be
obliterated,
but
a
good
deal
more
would
be
obliterated,
because
the
theory
would
have
to
be
that
because
it's
not
on
your
license
plate,
because
you
don't
have
to
carry
it,
you're
only
supporting
it,
then
that's
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
because,
otherwise,
its
being
government
speech
would
make
it
worse.
but
if
it's
all
the
difference
in
the
world
whether
you
have
to
carry
or
utter
it,
or
merely
support
it,
then
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
carefully
protecting
the
rights
of
dissenters
in
every
imaginable
kind
of
organization,
from
the
powerful
overriding
theory
that
collective-action
problems
mean
that
we've
really
got
to
get
more
speech
over
here
than
you
are
willing,
yourselves,
to
engage
in--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--you'd
be--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
we
do
that
all
the
time.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
we
do
that
all--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
time.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
why
we
have
elections,
in
part.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right?
we
have
elections,
in
part,
because
the
only
way...
there's
no
way
to
protect
every
individual's
right
to
have
the
government's
collective
policy
suit
his
or
her
fancy.
i
mean,
that
way--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--would
allow
complete
chaos.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--to
support...
supporting
speech
is
somewhat
different
from
supporting
activities
that
you
don't
agree
with.
i
mean,
the
first
amendment
makes
a
fundamental
difference
in
that
respect.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
there
were--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
or
any
structure.
i
mean,
bowen
v.
roy...
i
mean,
there's
a
sympathetic
case
of
the
man
who
did
not
want
little
bird
of
the
snow
to
be
given
a
social
security
number.
but
we
could,
when
we,
interactive
with
the
government,
say
to
him,
"you...
we
can't
make
you
give
the
number
to
get
the
food
for
your
little
daughter.
"
but
if
one
person
says,
"i
don't
want
numbers
in
your
computers.
"
and
the
other
says,
"i
don't
want
letters,
i
want
only
numbers.
"
the
fact
that
every
individual
who
has
a
potential
claim
on
a
collective
choice
could
pull
in
a
different
direction
means
we
can't
run
a
system
that
way.
but
no
such
problem
is
presented
in
cases
like
this.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you.
