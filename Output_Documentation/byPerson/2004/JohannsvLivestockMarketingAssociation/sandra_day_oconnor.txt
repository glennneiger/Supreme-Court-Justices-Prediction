mr.
kneedler,
will
you
tell
us
how
this
case
differs,
if
it
does,
from
what
was
before
the
court
in
united
foods?
what
meaningful
distinctions
do
you
find?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we've
never
addressed
that
in--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
these
cases--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--have
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
some
level,
it
certainly
is,
i
suppose.
but,
just
as
in
wheat
or
corn,
there
are
different
brands
and
different
qualities.
but
i
suppose
it's
still
fungible,
in
a
broad
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
you
whether,
in
deciding
the
government's
speech
doctrine,
is
it
the
secretary's
formal
right
to
control,
as
set
out
in
the
statute,
that
we
look
to,
or
do
we
look
to
the
secretary's
actual
record
of
oversight--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but
there
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--there
it
is
your
car,
your
property.
that's
not
this.
this
is
a
generic
ad
on
behalf
of
beef.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
there
is--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--there's
a
world
of
difference
between
this
and
having
something
put
on
your
license
plate
or
in
your--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
i
don't
even
understand
your
argument.
would
you
still
be
here
if
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
you're
trying.
[laughter]
would
you
still
be
here
if
there
were
distinctions
made
on
behalf
of
free-range
beef
or,
you
know,
"our
cattle"--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--"never
had
a"--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--"medicine"
or
something
like
that?
would
you
still
be
here
if
those
distinctions--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--had
been
made?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
just--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--asking
you
if,
theoretically,
some
attention
had
been
paid
to
the
different
kinds
of
producers--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--would
you
still
be
objecting?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
accept
the
fact
that
the
government
can
charge
taxes
on
the
sale
of
cigarettes
and
compel...
and
use
that
money
to
tell
people
that
they're
dangerous?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
do,
however.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
part
of
what's
going
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
you're
arguing
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
going
to
have
rather
a
drastic
effect
on--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what's
going
on.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
not
that.
the
same
program,
but
you
just
have
a
little
tag
on
the
ad.
