justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
remain
government
speech
even
if
you
don't
say,
"this
is
your
government
speaking"?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
say,
you
know,
"america's
cattlemen
are
speaking",
is
it
government
speech?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yeah,
but
some
people--
justice
antonin
scalia
--may
be
more
resistant
to
an...
to
an
ad
that
says,
"your
government
wants
to
eat...
wants
you
to
eat
more
meat.
"
than
they
are
to
an
ad
which
say,
"the
meat
producers
would
like
you
to
eat
more
meat.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
i
come
back
to
rust
versus
sullivan?
you
say
that
that
was
a
government
speech
case?
i
had
not
recollected
it
as
a
government
speech
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
government
subsidizing
speech
by
private
organizations,
and
it
chose
to
subsidize
one
type
of
speech,
but
not
another.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
we
say,
in
the
opinion,
that
this
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
for
the
precise
purpose
at
issue
here,
i
think
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference.
you
can
fund
private
people
for
some
things,
and
not
fund
them
for
others,
and
it
doesn't
make
whatever
they
say
government
speech.
i
think
that's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
that's
a
really--
justice
antonin
scalia
--strong
proposition,
that
whenever
you're
subsidizing
any
private
enterprise,
the
speech
of
that
private
enterprise
becomes
public
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
but
what
you
were
using
rust
for
was
to
establish
the
proposition
that
in
order
to
be
government
speech,
it...
you
don't
have
to...
you
don't
have
to
say,
"this
is
the
government
speaking".
justice
antonin
scalia
and
rust
doesn't
stand
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
want
to
treat
beef
and
mushrooms
inconsistently.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but,
i
mean,
that...
the
part
that's
good
can't
save
the
whole
thing,
any
more
than
in
the...
in
the
union
case,
the
fact
that
some...
the
union
dues
could
be
used
for
some
permissible
purposes,
saved
the
dues
that
were
being
used
for
impermissible
purposes.
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
want
to
just
save
half
of
this
program,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
first
address
the
question
you
said...
you
said
you
were
going
to
address,
whether
in
order
to
be
government
speech,
within
the
meaning
of
our
cases,
it
has
to
be
identified
as
such.
is
that
really
true?
i
mean,
you
know,
in
world
war
ii,
bob
hope
would
appear
in
movie
theaters
and
say,
you
know,
"buy
war
bonds"?
justice
antonin
scalia
"this
is
bob
hope.
"
"you
people
ought
to
go
out
now--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay,
so
it
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
is
not
essential--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
government
might...
in
order
to
be
government
speech,
the
government
does
not
have
to
identify
itself
as
the
speaker.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
or
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
just
indulge
us.
i
mean,
some
of
us
think
it
makes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
difference--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
i
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
would
like
to
know
whether
it
is
essential
to
its
character
as
government
speech
that
the
government's
say,
"this
your
government
speaking".
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
it
all
the
time
in
general
taxes.
every--
justice
antonin
scalia
--time
we
pay
general
taxes,
we're
supporting
government
speech--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
may
not
agree
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
i
don't...
i
had
not
understood
you
to
be
arguing,
professor
tribe,
that
this
would
be
unlawful,
even
if
the
money
were
raised
in
the
fashion
that
it
is,
just
from
the...
just
from
the
cattlemen.
and
the
government's
own
program
used
that
money
to
say,
"your
government
thinks
it's...
wants
you
to
know
that
beef
is
thoroughly
safe.
"
"we've
done
studies.
"
"beef
is
good
for
you.
"
"you
should
eat
more
beef.
"
i
thought
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
would
be
permissible?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
it
involves
a
challenge
to
the
federal
program
of
generic
advertising
for
beef,
popularly
known
as
the
"beef,
it's
what's
for
dinner"
campaign.
pursuant
to
a
federal
statute,
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
imposes
a
$1
per
head
assessment
or
a
checkoff
on
all
cattle
sold
in
or
imported
to
this
country.
the
money
is
used
to
fund
a
number
of
beef
related
activities
including
research,
consumer
education,
and
the
marketing
programs
at
issue
here.
the
cattlemen’s
beef
promotion
and
research
board,
an
entity
whose
members
are
nominated
by
state
beef
councils
and
appointed
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
proposes
the
marketing
campaigns
which
the
agriculture
department
itself
vets
and
approves.
many
of
the
advertisements
funded
by
the
checkoff
contain
a
tag
line
stating
that
they
are
“funded
by
america’s
beef
producers.”
the
respondents
here
are
several
cattlemen
who
paid
the
checkoff
and
two
organizations
whose
members
pay
the
check
off.
they
object
to
being
compelled
to
fund
the
beef
advertising
for
various
reasons.
for
example,
some
of
them
complained
that
the
ads
promote
beef
in
general
rather
than
their
own
particular
specialty
such
as
grain-fed
beef
or
certified
angus
beef.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
respondent’s
contention
that
the
ads
violate
the
first
amendment
by
forcing
beef
producers
to
pay
for
speech
with
which
they
disagree,
and
it
held
unenforceable,
the
statute
and
the
regulations
creating
the
beef
board
and
imposing
the
check
off.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
order
and
the
injunction.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
facially
invalidate
the
checkoff.
prior
cases
decided
by
this
court
have
held
unconstitutional
compelled
subsidies
and
speech,
including
a
federally
mandated
checkoff
similar
to
the
one
here
which
funded
generic
advertising
for
mushrooms.
each
of
these
cases
was
decided,
however,
on
the
understanding
that
the
plaintiffs
were
being
forced
to
subsidize
private
speech.
we
have
consistently
respected
the
principle
that
compelled
support
of
government
is
fundamentally
different
from
compelled
support
of
a
private
association.
as
every
taxpayer
knows,
all
governments
fund
their
operations
including
operations
that
involve
speech
by
the
government
through
compulsory
exaction
even
when
their
citizens
object
to
the
programs
for
which
the
tax
is
paid.
the
respondents
contend
that
the
beef
advertisements
are
not
the
usual
form
of
government
speech
because
they
are
designed
by
the
beef
board
and
its
operating
committee,
some
of
whose
member
are
appointed
by
a
private
organization.
we
think
this
distinction
is
not
persuasive
because
the
federal
government
exercises
effective
control
over
the
content.
congress
has
specified
the
general
message,
federal
statutes
and
regulations
set
out
specific
elements
and
officials
of
the
agriculture
department
exercise
approval
authority
over
every
word
used
in
every
promotional
campaign.
the
first
amendment
analysis
is
not
changed
by
the
fact
that
this
government
speech
is
funded
through
a
targeted
assessment
on
cattle
sales.
citizens
have
no
first
amendment
right
to
resist
funding
government
speech
whether
the
government
garners
the
funds
through
general
taxes
or
through
more
narrowly
focused
assessments.
although
the
targeted
assessment
means
that
the
ads
are,
as
the
tagline
states,
funded
by
america’s
beef
producers.
respondents
have
not
presented
any
evidence
that
this
attribution
would
cause
people
who
view
the
ads
to
think
that
the
message
is
actually
endorsed
by
particular
beef
producers
such
as
the
respondents.
we,
therefore,
do
not
consider
whether
the
beef
advertisements
violate
the
first
amendment
by
effectively
speaking
in
respondent’s
name.
we
conclude
only
that
the
beef
checkoff
is
not
facially
invalid
under
the
first
amendment.
the
respondent’s
complaint
included
several
other
grounds
for
challenging
the
checkoff
program
which
the
lower
courts
have
not
yet
considered.
respondents
may
now
proceed
on
these
other
claims.
for
these
reasons
and
others
stated
in
our
opinion,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
eight
circuit
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justices
thomas
and
breyer
have
filed
concurring
opinions;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
and
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
kennedy
have
joined.
