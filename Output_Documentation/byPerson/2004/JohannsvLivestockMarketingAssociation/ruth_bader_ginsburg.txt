but,
mr.
kneedler--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there
is...
there's
another
tape
put
out
by
the
government,
on
meat,
and
that...
what
is
the
government
speech?
usually,
the
government
has
a
position,
and
is
presenting
it.
here,
we
have
america
beef
producers
has
a
label
on...
"eat
meat".
but
if
you
went
to
the
surgeon
general,
probably
that
message
would
be
"eat
meat
moderately".
so
what
is
the
government
speech?
i
don't
know
another
case
involving
a
claim
of
government
speech
where
the
message
that
you
are
saying
is
the
government's
is
not
the
message
that
the
government
is
putting
out
when
it's
dealing
with
its
concern
for
public
health.
justice

mr.
kneedler,
this
theory
is
one
that
wasn't
brought
up
at
all
in
wileman,
if
i
remember
correctly.
and
in
united
foods,
it
was
brought
up
too
late,
so
the
government...
so
the
court
didn't
entertain
it.
the
argument
that
you're
making
today,
i
take
it,
would
necessarily
displace
united
foods
has
having
any
kind
of
a
continuing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
public
perception
of
these
ads...
it
says,
"eat
meat"...
it's
quite
different
from
saying,
"your
government
wants
you
to
buy
meat.
"
and
the
united
states
isn't
saying
that.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
then--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--isn't
it
more
realistic
to
describe
this
as
the
government
facilitating
the
private
speech
of
the
many
people
in
this
industry
who
don't
have
a
big
budget
to
advertise
on--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
their
own?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case,
not
united
foods.
because
united
foods,
the
court
said
it...
it
was
not
legitimately
before
us.
justice

mr.
tribe--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--he's
just
going
back
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that...
is
that
an
answer
to
the
question
that
justice
kennedy
urged
in
the
opening
argument?
that
is,
it's
the
same
dollar
a
head,
except
you
call
it
an
excise
tax
instead
of
a...
whatever
this
is
called.
the
same
thing,
but
to
say
it's
a
tax.
and
you're
not...
this
is
not
general
revenues
that
you
collect
from
everybody
and
spend--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
suppose--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
don't
have
that?
i
mean,
could
then...
could
the
government
fix
this
problem
this
way,
saying,
"we're
going
to
get
the
same
bucks,
but
we
are
going...
and
we're
going
to
have
the
same
kinds
of
ads,
but
they're
going
to
be
labeled,

yes.
