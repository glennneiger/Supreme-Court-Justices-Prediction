mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
the
beef
promotion
and
research
act
in
1985
in
the
midst
of
a
serious
depression
in
the
beef
industry.
the
beef
industry
found
itself
unable
to
respond
to
that
situation
through
the
promotion
of
its
products.
congress
responded
to
that
situation
by
establishing
a
government
program
of
promotion,
research,
and
consumer
information.
in
the
beef
act,
congress
prescribed
a
central
message
for
advertising
under
the
act,
congress
established
a
government
body,
the
beef
board,
to
administer
and
implement
the
program,
and
it
placed
the
program
under
the
control
of
a
cabinet
officer,
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
important
distinction
is
that
the
two
grounds
that...
on
which
we
are
defending
the
statute
here
were
not
addressed
in
united
foods.
in
particular,
the
government
speech
argument,
that
what
i've
just
said
goes
to,
that
the
court
specifically
did
not
address
because
it
had
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
none
of
these
cases,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
court
has
not.
and
we
think
that
that
is...
the
critical
point
about
this...
about
this
case
and
these
programs,
these
are
government...
these
are
programs
of
government
speech.
as
i
said,
congress,
itself,
prescribed
the
central
message.
congress
established
the
government
board,
all
of
whose
members
are
appointed
by
the
secretary,
to
administer
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
does...
for
purposes
of
this
court's
government
speech
doctrine,
it
does.
and
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
the
court...
the
court's
decision
in
rust,
i
think,
is
the
best
illustration
of
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it...
all
those
statements
say...
and
there
are
advertisements
in
the
record
that
say
that
the
advertising
is
funded
by
america's
beef
producers,
which
is,
of
course,
accurate,
because
they--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
pay
for
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but,
again,
in
rust,
the
doctor
who
spoke...
i
think
the
patient
who
went
to
see
the
doctor
for
counseling
would
have...
would
have
assumed
or
believed
that
the
doctor
was...
in
the
immediate
encounter,
that
the
doctor
was
speaking,
and
yet
the
court,
in
its
subsequent
cases,
has
regarded
rust
as
a
situation
of
government
speech.
but
the
important
point
about
what
you've
just
asked
is
that
any
concerns
about
the
tag
line
in
the
advertising
does
not
go
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
or
the
beef
order.
neither
the
act
nor
the
order
requires
that
in
the
advertising.
and
if
the
court
was
to
perceive
that
as
a
problem,
the
right
remedy
would
not
be
to
invalidate
the
act,
but
to,
instead,
provide
that
there
should
be
some
different
identification--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--on
the
advertising,
itself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
and
i
think
in
rust,
some
people
would
have
been
resistant
to
the
idea
that
your
government
wants
you
to
engage
in
family
planning,
but
what
the...
what
the
court
said
about
rust
was
that
the
government
had
established
a
program
with
a
central
message
about
counseling.
that
was
then
carried
out
by
private
individuals.
here,
this
case
is
much
stronger
than
rust.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
would
be
accurate--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
they're...
i'm
sure
that
a
label
could
be
devised
that
would...
that
would
be
accurate.
the...
first
of
all,
they
are
approved...
specifically
approved
by
the
department
of
agriculture.
the...
certainly,
the
act
and
regulations
provide
that
the
secretary
must
approve
every
contract,
every
project
for
advertising.
and,
beyond
that,
the
usda
approves
all
advertising,
all
copy--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
actually
to
be
used,
so
there
is
specific
approval
by
the
secretary.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
government,
in
the
concern...
in
situations
where
it
may
be
concerned
about
public
health,
doesn't
say,
"don't
eat
meat".
it...
there
may
be
nutritional
standards.
and
usda
does
have
nutritional
standards
that
it
advises
people
to
adhere
to.
but
what
the
government
is
doing
here
is
facilitating
a
situation,
facilitating
promotion
of
a
commodity.
there
is
a
structural
defect
in
a
market
like...
a
market
for
a
fungible
commodity,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
what
congress
was
responding
to
here.
when
you
have
a
fungible
commodity,
when
you
have
a
lot
of
small
producers,
no
one
of
those
producers
has
an
incentive
to
advertise--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
are...
there
are...
there
are,
to
be
sure,
different
cuts
of
meat,
but
the...
but
the
basic--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
congress
could
reasonably
determine,
under
this
statute,
that
there
are...
that
there
are...
that
beef
has
many
things
in
common,
that
it
is
a
generic
problem...
or
generic
food
or
generic
commodity,
and
the
industry--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
fungible
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
think
the...
we
think
the
formal
legal
control
is
sufficient.
and
it...
the
secretary
has
the
responsibility
to
approve...
under
the
statute...
to
approve
budgets,
to
approve
contracts,
and
to
approve
projects.
and
usda
does,
in
fact,
go
beyond
that
and
determine
whether
particular
advertisements
will
be...
will
be
issued.
but
we
think
it's
only
necessary
to
look
what
the
statute
requires.
but
the
testimony
in
this
case
shows
that,
in
any
event,
usda
is
extensively
involved
in
the
development
of
the
advertising
under
this
statute,
by
extensive
consultations
with
the
operating
committee
and
the
beef
board
in
the
development
of
the
project.
so
there...
this
is
an
integrated
effort
within
the
department
of
agriculture.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--what
has...
what
has
been
proposed
by
the...
by
the
respondents
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
to
make
it
voluntary,
so
that
people--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--can
opt
out.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
and
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
it...
i
think
it
would
not
be
feasible.
it
would...
it
would
enmesh
the
department
in
difficult
judgements
and
time-consuming--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--absolutely.
and
the
court
made
a
similar
point
in
southworth,
where
it
specifically
declined
to
impose,
on
the
university,
a
requirement
to
make
judgements
that
would
enable
people
to
opt
out
in
particular
cases.
and
we
think
that
the
problem
here
would
be
even
greater.
but
they
would
be
particularly
great
under
respondents'
proposal
that
individuals
who
don't
want
to
pay,
without
even
having
to
express
an
objection,
because
the
whole
system
would
collapse.
this
is
a
classic
collective-action,
free-rider
problem.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
the
numbers--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yeah--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
in
rust,
but
in
the
court's
subsequent
cases,
rosenberger,
southworth...
in
particular,
in
velazquez...
this
court
said
that
rust
has
come
to
be
understood
by
the
court
as
a
government
speech
case,
because
the
government
prescribed
a
message,
and
it's
government
speech
whether
or
not
the
government
speaks
for
itself
or
enlists
others
to
transmit
the
message.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
there's
really
no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there's
really
no
need
to
get
to
that
point
here,
because
the
beef
board,
which
is
the
entity
that
does
the
speaking,
is,
i
think,
unquestionably
a
government
body.
it's
established
by
special
statute
under
the
lebron
test.
all
of
its
members
are
appointed
by
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--what...
i
think,
as
this
court
has
come
to
explain
rust,
as
being
issues
of
government
speech...
but,
as
i
say,
there
is
no
need...
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
to
get
to
that
situation.
and
the
fact
that
the
government
is
the
one
in
control
of
the
speech
here
critically
distinguished...
distinguishes
this
case
from
cases
like
keller
and
abood.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think...
i
think
they
would
say
that
that...
that
there's
something
different
about
general
taxes
and
excise
taxes
or
focus
taxes.
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
basis
in
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
history
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
sorry,
do...
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
were
you
asking
why
focus--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i...
and
maybe
i
misunderstood.
was
it...
was
it
paying
for
it
out
of
general
taxes
or
taking
this
money
and
putting
into
the
focus--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
they
may
say
that
that's
the
same
thing,
but
i...
they
were
drawing
a
distinction
between
paying
for
it
out
of
general
funds...
income
tax
or
something...
that
we
all
would
pay
for.
they
say
that's
the
solution,
rather
than
having
the
industry,
that
benefits
from
the
advertising,
pay
for
it.
not
only
does
the
industry
benefit--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
there
would
be
standing
objection...
objections
at
that
point,
but
we
think,
in
terms
of
the
merits
of
the
argument,
the
notion
that
a
person
would
have
a
first
amendment
objection
to
paying
an
excise
tax
because
of
the
uses
to
which
the
excise
taxes
are
being
put
is
really
extraordinary
and
finds
no
basis
in
cases
like
abood
and
keller,
which
have
to
do
with
private
association...
an
association
with
private
speech--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no
government
speech.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
if
that...
but
the
funds
that
are
raised
are
public
monies.
they
don't
go
in...
they're
not
deposited
in
the
treasury.
but
in
the
joint
appendix,
there
is
a
reproduced...
an
ams,
agricultural
marketing
service,
circular
that
explains
how
these
public
monies...
and
calls
them
"public
monies"...
are
to
be
disposed
of.
and
it
describes
the
beef
board,
this
governmental
body
that
receives
the
money,
as
being
the
custodian
for
the
agricultural
marketing
service
and
handling
these
monies.
and
congress
and
the
secretary
have
imposed
strict
limitations
on
how
those
funds
can
be
deposited.
so
whether
they
go
into
the
general
treasury
or
whether
they're
handled
in
this
way
is
really
a
matter
of
fiscal
and
revenue
and
internal
governmental
policy
that
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
because
the
government
did
not
reach
the
government
speech...
or
the
court
did
not
reach
the
government
speech
argument
in
united
foods.
and,
in
fact,
united
foods
is
back,
on
remand.
that
was
a
reversal
of
summary
judgement
for
the
government.
it's
back,
on
remand,
and
is
being
stayed,
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case
on
government
speech.
so
there
would
not
be
an
inconsistent
result
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
what
the...
what
the
united
states
is
doing
is
responding
to
this
classic
collective-action
problem
by
establishing
a
government
program
to
meet
the
situation
where
the
industry,
itself,
will...
is
unable
to
conduct
the
advertising
because
of...
because
of,
what
i
said,
the
fungibility
of
the
product--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
all.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--doctrinally,
it
is
government
speech.
it
has
the...
it
has
the
benefit
of
enabling
the
promotion
that
would
have
happened
in
the
industry,
but
for
the
collective-action
problem
to
occur.
but
it
is
government
speech
under
this
court's
decision.
if
i
may--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--please.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
mr.
tribe
has
conceded
that
if
this
program
were
financed
by
a
system
of
excise
taxes
that
went
into
the
general
treasury,
and
congress
then
paid...
provided
the
exact
same
amount
of
money
to
produce
the
exact
same
ads,
that
there
would
be
no
constitutional
problem.
and,
in
our
view,
the
first
amendment
simply
does
not
regulate
the
details
of
government
fundraising,
the
details
of
government
accounting,
and
the
details
of
government
bookkeeping
in
that
manner.
the
first
amendment
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and
the
court...
the
court
superceded
those
decisions
in
cases
like
carmichael
coal
and
storaasli
company
and
cases
like
that,
where
the
court
said
excise
taxes
can
be
imposed.
as
long
as
there
is
a
public
welfare
justification,
they
can
be
spent.
and
it
would
be
an
odd
result
to
have
the
first
amendment
drive
the
way
the
government
arranges
a
system
like
this.
after
all...
and
professor
tribe
said
it
would
be
different
if
the
cattlemen's
beef
board
were
gotten
rid
of.
it
actually...
the
principal
point
here
is
the
secretary
controls
the
speech.
whatever
the
cattlemen's
beef
board
does...
and
that
is
a
government
entity...
the
secretary
controls
the
speech.
so
that...
this
is
not
some
jury-rigged
system;
this
is
a
system
of
governmental
control.
congress
has
prescribed
the
message,
and
the
secretary
carries
it
out.
it's
important
to
recall
that
many
federal
excise
taxes
go
into
dedicated
trust
funds...
for
highways,
for
other
functions
like
that.
and
out
of
that
dedicated
trust
fund,
there
may
be
money
expended
on
highway
safety.
so
the
fact
that
it's
dedicated
really
should
not
matter.
and
this
case
is
completely
different
from
cases
like
keller.
in
keller,
the
state
bar
was
not
appointed
by
the...
by
the
government,
there
was
no
governmental
supervision
of
what
it
did,
and
the
government
certainly
did
not
approve
the
messages
in
favor
of
nuclear
freezes,
et
cetera.
this
is
different
in
all
the
critical
ways
that
make
this
a
program
of
government
speech.
and,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
to
strike
down
this
program
would
have
drastic
consequences.
there
are
many,
many
agricultural
promotion
programs
like
this.
there
are
13
at
the
national
level.
this
program
has
been
in
existence
since
1988.
one
billion
dollars
has
been
collected,
and
promotions
have
been
conducted
under
it.
these
promotional
programs
go
back
to
the
'50s,
and
even...
and
even
earlier.
and
there
are
many
programs
on
the
state
levels,
as
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
states
in
this
case
shows.
this
court
would
be
striking
down
a
lot
to
hold
that
this
commonsense
way
of
approaching
things
is
unconstitutional.
it's
also
important
to
recognize
that
the
ultimate
beneficiary
of
the
advertising
is
the
consumer.
yes,
it
affects
the
industry,
but
it's
the
consumer.
and
the
very
first
finding
that
congress
made
in
the
beef
act
is,
beef
and
beef
products
are
basic
foods
that
are
a
valuable
part
of
the
human
diet.
when
the...
when
the...
because
of
the
collective-action
problem
in
this
industry,
that
it
cannot
organize
to
advertise,
that
basic
message
is
not
getting
to
consumers.
so
this...
the
justifications
for
this,
to
the
extent
one
thinks
of
it
in
terms
of
the
commercial
