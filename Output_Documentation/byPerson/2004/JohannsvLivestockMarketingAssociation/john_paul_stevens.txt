we
will
now
hear
argument
in
veneman
against
the
livestock
marketing
association.
mr.
kneedler.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
is
meat
fungible?
or...
i
think
there
are
some
steak
houses
that
might
disagree
with
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
even
quality
of
meat
within
the...
some
is
tougher
than
others.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
like
milk
or
wheat.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
want
to
save
your
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garre.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
mr.
tribe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
would--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
comment
on
the
argument
that...
what
will
this
do
to
compelling
cigarette
manufacturers
to
finance
the
advertisements
against
smoking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
have
to
give
warning.
but
why
is
the...
why
is
the
cigarette
analogy
different
from
this
case?
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
want
to
be
sure
i...
that
i
understood
your
answer.
you
can
compel
them
to
make
warnings.
can
you
compel
them
to
pay
for
warnings
that
are
just
industry-specific,
in
saying,
"this
is
dangerous"--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it
seems--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--almost
ironic,
to
me,
to
say
that
you
have
a
greater
power
to
tell
the
whole
industry
to
publish
something
they
don't
want
to
publish
than
you
do
to
let
them--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--pay
for
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--90
percent
of
them
want
to
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
limiting
your
point
to
putting
information
on
the
package,
or
are
you
saying
they
could...
could
california
compel
a
cigarette...
companies
to
contribute
to
a
large
fund
which
is
just
used
to
by
newspaper
advertising
describing
the
dangers
of
smoking?
could
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
there
are
disagreements.
we
were...
you
were
talking
about
cigarettes.
but
supposing
there's
a
legitimate
disagreement
between
the
industry
position
and
the
government
position--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--could
the
government,
nevertheless,
insist
on
the
industry
financing
advertising
advocating
the
government's
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
on
the
other
hand--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you're
running
into
the
problem
that
the
taxpayer
can
be
compelled
to
pay
taxes
to
support
activities
that
he
doesn't
support
at
all.
that's
the
other--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
other
extreme.
i
know
we--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
it
all
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
are
we
crossing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--inconsistent
with
the
basic
principle
on
which
you
rely,
that
the
individual
should
not
be
compelled
to
support
speech--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
which
he
disagrees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
we
understand
your
position.
thank
you.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
about
three...
three
or
four
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
