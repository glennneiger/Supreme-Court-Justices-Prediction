mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
32
years
ago
in
zahn
v.
international
paper
affirmed
that
a
class
action
could
not
proceed
under
28
u.s.c.,
section
1332,
the
diversity
statute,
if
it
was
clear
that
some
of
the
unnamed
members
of
that
class
do
not
satisfy
the
amount-in-controversy
requirement.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
in
1990
overturned
this
court's
ruling
in
zahn
and
its
interpretation
of
section
1332
not
by
amending
section
1332
but,
instead,
by
enacting
a
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute,
section
1367.
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honors,
is
no.
plaintiffs
in
the
lower
courts
that
have
felt
constrained
to
conclude
that
the
language
of
section
1367
requires
the
conclusion
that
zahn
and,
candidly,
also
this
court's
decision
in
strawbridge
were
overruled
by
1367
do
so
by
gliding
past
the
express
language
in
1367(a)
that
is
the
primary
basis
upon
which
our
argument
stands.
in
the
appendix
246a
to
the
petition,
there's...
the
central
language
is
in
(a).
it
says,
in
any
civil
action,
of
which
the
district
courts
have
original
jurisdiction.
that
language
by
its
terms
and...
clearly
indicates
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
make
any
adjustments
in
the
background
law
that
exists
that
defined
diversity
jurisdiction
or
federal
court
jurisdiction,
federal
question
jurisdiction
as
a
condition
to
going
forward.
so
what
the
congress
says
is,
look
at
the
law
as
it
exists
in
1990,
as
it's
been
interpreted
by
this
court,
and
then
determine
whether
or
not
there's
federal
jurisdiction,
either
for
diversity
or
federal
question,
and
if
there
is,
then
you
proceed
forth
from
that
point.
and
what
we
know
is
that
there
are
two
situations
that
will
not
satisfy
original
jurisdiction
under
those
circumstances.
the
first
one
is
in
the
zahn
situation.
where
you
have
both
satisfying
and
unsatisfying
plaintiffs
in
the
unnamed...
who
are
in
the
unnamed
members
of
the
class,
this
court
said
you
cannot
proceed
forth
under
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
the
second
one
is
the
classic
sort
of
joinder
situation,
and
what
the
court
held
in
strawbridge
is
that
simply
because
you
have
a
plaintiff
who
satisfies
the
amount-in-controversy
requirement
and
satisfies
the
complete
diversity
requirement
does
not
mean
that
you're
allowed
to
join
under
rule
20
an
additional
plaintiff
who
does
not
satisfy
both
of
those
requirements.
and
if
you
bring
someone
in
under
those
circumstances,
that
defeats
jurisdiction
at
the
beginning
before
you
ever
took
to
trying
to
decide
what
the
scope
of
section
1367(a)
and
(b)
mean
from
that
point
forward.
so
then
the
question
is,
if
that's
the
correct
interpretation
of
1367(a)'s
predicate
language,
then
what
work
does
1367(a)
and
1367(b)
do,
and
does
our
interpretation
do
any
violence
to
the
structure
of
the
statute?
and
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
no.
here
we
start
by
looking
at
what
was
congress'
clear
intent,
manifested
primarily
in
the
last
language
of
1367(a),
where
it
says
supplemental
jurisdiction
shall
include
claims
that
involve
the
joinder
or
intervention
of
additional
parties.
here--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i...
i
don't
think
that's
the
right
conclusion
to
draw
from
those
cases,
justice
ginsburg,
because
what
happened
is
by
the
time
that...
those
cases
got
to
this
court,
the
jurisdictional
problems
had
been
solved
and
the
court
was
faced
with
a
question...
with
what
i
perceive
to
be
purely
a
remedial
question,
is
what
do
you
do
in
terms
of
trying
to
put
the
omelette
back
into
the
egg
at
that
point
when
the
litigation
has
gone
forward.
and
the
court,
as
a
matter
of
judicial
efficiency,
decided
essentially
to
ignore
the
jurisdictional
problem.
here,
by
contrast,
this
jurisdictional
problem
existed
on
day
one,
and
the
complaint
was
filed--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
continues--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it...
it's
curable
in
the
sense
that
you
can
eventually
excise
out
portions
of
the
case,
but
what
you
cannot
do
is...
is
allow
the
case
to
go...
it
remains
still
jurisdictionally
barred
to
proceed
forth
with
parties
who
are
not
properly
before
the
court.
that's...
that's
what
this
court
said
specifically
in...
in
zahn
itself.
it
said
the
problem
is
that
you
cannot
simply
go
forward
with
the
federal
claim
and
with
the
state
claims
in
that...
in
that
format.
you
surely
can
excise
portions
of
them,
but
then
you
start
over
again.
once
you
excise
them,
that's
a
new
complaint.
it's
a
new
case.
that's
the
fundamental
difference.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
understand
that
the
court's
ultimate
remedy
in
both
of
those
cases
was
not
to
do
a
do-over,
but
you
also
have
to
remember...
i
mean,
i
think
there
are
two
questions
here.
one
is
do
you
ignore
the
jurisdictional
problem.
and
what
i'm
proposing
to
you
is
this
court
has
never
ignored
the
jurisdictional
problem.
it
always
solves
the
jurisdictional
problem
somehow,
whether
it
dismisses
the
case,
as
it
did
in...
in
grupo
dataflux,
whether
it
dismisses
the
case,
as
it...
as
it
proposed
would
have
to
happen
in
zahn
if
they
didn't
excise
one
of
the
parties,
or
whether
it
makes
an
adjustment.
the
court
always
takes
account
of
the
jurisdictional
problem
and
finds
a
method
of
fixing
it.
so
that's
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the...
well,
the...
and
the
question
is
what
adjustment
should
it
make.
and
the...
and...
and
our
argument
is
at
a
minimum
you
have
to
dismiss
all
of
the
class
claims.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
that
takes
you
back
to
what
the
district
court
ruled
in
zahn
and...
and,
in
effect,
what
this
court
affirmed
in
zahn,
which
is
that
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
sort
of
finding
a
single,
individual
plaintiff
and
saying,
you
know,
this
person,
if
you
could
just
excise
that
claim,
drop
it
under
rule...
that
person
under
rule
21,
that
fixes
it.
there's
a
fundamental
difference.
i
mean,
the
question
here
is
what's
the
civil
action
because
there
are
res
judicata,
collateral
estoppel--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
that
would...
one
of
the
alternatives
on
the
table...
i
think
it
is
appropriate...
is
for
the
court
to
excise
the
class
action
allegations--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
dismiss
the
entirety
of
the
class
and
proceed
forth
solely
in
the
name
of
the
four
individual
plaintiffs.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
court
has
the
authority
to
do
that.
i
think
the
practical
implications
of
that
are
overwhelming
and
should
be...
and
should
be
rejected
for
that
reason
because
in
order
to
be
able
to
have
res
judicata/collateral
estoppel
effects,
you
have
to
know
what
the
civil
action
is.
and
with
a
class
of
unnamed
members,
who
are,
in
many
instances,
unknowable
in...
in
some
respects,
we
don't
know
what
the
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
effects
are
if
your
solution
is
to
try
to
excise
those
who
do
not
satisfy
the
amount-in-controversy
requirement.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i...
i
think
the
case
should
never
have
been
allowed
to
go
forward
except
with
the
named
plaintiffs.
okay.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
not...
but...
but
it's
a
much
more
complicated
issue
preclusion
problem
because
the
question
is,
is
there
jurisdiction?
this
is
a
judgment
that's
been
entered
without
jurisdiction.
the
court
doesn't
have
proper
jurisdiction
here--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i...
i
would--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
doesn't
eliminate
it
completely,
justice
o'connor.
the
class
action
fairness
act
only
applies
to
claims
where
there
are
plaintiffs
who
exceed
the
number
of
100,
plaintiffs
over
100,
and...
and
the
$5
million
amount-in-controversy--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
it's
not
retroactive.
but
even
prospectively,
there
will
be
situations
where
this
precise
issue
will
arise
in
the
future.
so
there
is
reason
for
the
court
to
go
ahead
and
resolve
this
question
that
has
so
badly
divided
the
courts.
but,
justice
o'connor,
to
answer
your
first
question,
i
would
have...
i
would
have
thought
the
conclusion
was
exactly
the
opposite,
that
what...
what...
the
statute
says
you
don't
have
jurisdiction
over
civil
actions
over
which
you
didn't
have
jurisdiction
prior
to
1990,
but
you
do
have
jurisdiction
over
claims
that
then
can
be
appended
to
those
for
which
you
have
jurisdiction
in
1990.
so
i
would
have
thought
the
more
sensible
way,
at
least
from
my
perspective,
to
read
this
case...
to
read
this
statute
is
to
say,
is
this
a
claim
that
could
have
been
brought
in
1990?
and
the
answer
from
zahn
is
absolutely
no,
it
couldn't.
and
similarly
with
the...
with
the
joinder
cases.
they
could
not
have
been
brought--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
clearly
was
enacted
later,
but
my
point
here
is
that
i
think
the
language...
when
the
congress
both
in
(a)
and
(b)
harkens
back
to
in
any
civil
action
of
which
the
district
courts
have
original
jurisdiction,
it's
clearly
not
trying
to
amend
1331
or
1332.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
hope
that's
not
a
criticism
of
the
writing.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
that's
not
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the...
the...
you
know,
the
traditional
case.
you're
from
one
state,
i'm
from
another
state,
i
have
a
claim
against
you
for
at
least
$50,000,
i
sue
you
in
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
a
civil
action
of
which
district
courts
have
original
jurisdiction.
so
i've
sued
you.
you
have
an
insurer
who's
going...
who...
who
lives
in
the
same
state
i
live.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
bring
in
the
insurer
in
a
third
party...
in
a
third
party
claim
under
rule
14.
okay?
that
claim
doesn't
satisfy
the
$75,000,
whatever
the
amount-in-controversy
requirement
is
that
applies,
because
you've
got
a...
a
retention.
then...
and
so
your...
your
claim
against
them
is
only
for
$50,000.
that
wouldn't
satisfy
the
amount-in-controversy
requirement
but
it
does
satisfy
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
claims
brought
separately.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
that
would
be
one
easy
one--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--absolutely
falls
within
(a).
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
that
would
be
precisely
how
it
operates.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
which
is?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i
picked
one.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there's
another
one
that
fits--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
my
guess
is
if
they
did,
you
probably
wouldn't
want
to
rely
on
it
as
the
authoritative
source
for
interpreting
the
language
of
the
statute
in
any
event.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
pendent
party
jurisdiction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no.
actually
what
i'm
saying
is
that
1367(a),
in
effect,
codifies
both
aspects
of
the
kroger...
of
this
court's
decision
in
kroger.
in
kroger,
the
court
said
you
would
have
ancillary
jurisdiction
over
the
third
party
claim
that
i
identified
for
justice
breyer,
and
that
that
would
fall
within
1367(a)
under
my
interpretation
of
it,
but
that
1367(b)
would
not
allow
the
plaintiff
then
to
bring
a
subsequent
action
against
the
third
party
defendant.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
only
way
i
would
just...
you
know,
the
only
point
i
would
make
with
respect
to
that
is
that
i
do
think
that
in
finley
this
court's
opinion
cast
some
doubt
on
the
entire
pendent
and
ancillary
jurisdiction
doctrines,
and
i
think
that
1367(a)
is
clearly
designed
to...
to
eliminate
that
issue
going
forward
because
it
says
there
is
a
role.
there
is
now
a...
an
express
provision
from
congress
to
the
courts
of
supplemental
jurisdiction.
and
then
the
question
is
under
what
circumstances
does
it
apply.
so
to
go
back
to
the
owen
case,
you
know,
we
all
assumed
that
there
was
ancillary
jurisdiction
over
the
third
party
claim.
this
statute
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
there
is
jurisdiction
over
the
third
party
claim
because
it...
it
extends
to
that
claim.
and
we
know
that
by
the
express
language
of
the
provision.
it
wouldn't
have
changed
anything
if
you
accept
the
idea
that
the
court
had
inherent
authority
to
do
that.
if
you
question
that,
then
this
is
the
basis
on
which
that
jurisdictional
grant
is
provided.
and
so
that
is
an
important
part
of
1367(a)
that
affects--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i...
i
would
go
back--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
just
depends
on
whether
you
accept
as
a
given
that
the
third
party
claim
and
other
multi-party
litigation
was
clearly
going
to
fall
within
the
court's
ancillary
jurisdiction
without
the
benefit
of
an
express
statutory
provision
granting
that
authority.
if
you
accept
that,
then
this
makes
a
fundamental
change.
if
i
could--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
the...
the
question
is
what
was
the
statutory
authority
for
that
part
of...
for
the
first
part
of
ancillary
jurisdiction,
which
is
the
bringing
in
of
the
third
party
defendant.
and
that's
what
1367(a)
does
in
the
diversity
context.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
justice
stevens.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank...
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
i'd
just
like
to
make
a
few
points.
first
of
all,
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
about
the
city
of
chicago
case,
and
justice
ginsburg
said
this
sort
of
feels
like
a
finley
type
case
in
the...
in...
in
how
it
applies
in
the
diversity
context.
but
the
fundamental
point
here
is
that
there
is
a
very
different
approach
and
there
has
always
been
a
very
different
approach
to
federal
question
jurisdiction
and
to
diversity
jurisdiction.
federal
question
jurisdiction
has
always
been
claims-driven.
diversity
jurisdiction
has
always
been
party-driven.
and
the
congress
that
enacted
1367
in
1990
had
to
have
understood
that.
it's
been
the
law
for
as
long
as...
as
we've
had...
for
the
200
years
that
strawbridge
has
been
around,
that
distinction
has...
has
existed.
and
so
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
interpret
civil
action
differently
in
this
particular
statute.
we're
asking
the
court
to
focus
on
civil
actions
of
which
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction.
that
incorporates
all
of
the
requirements
of
1331
and
1332.
second,
justice
breyer,
i'm
a
little
reluctant
to
get
into
this
rule
19,
rule
24
to
try...
but
i
think
i
can
help
at
least
clarify
at
least
some
aspects
of
it.
rule
19
by
its
terms
excludes
situations
that
defeat
jurisdiction.
so
it
says
in
the
rule
that
if
you're
bringing
in
a
necessary
party...
remember,
this
is
the
defendant
who
is
bringing
in
a
necessary
party...
if
it
would
defeat
jurisdiction,
you
can't
do
it,
and
if
it
still
is
indispensable,
you
have
to
dismiss
the
entirety
of
the
case,
which
is
precedent
for
the
notion
that
sometimes
you
have
to
dismiss
the
entirety
of
the
case
in
situations
where
you
don't
have
jurisdiction
over
a
particular
party.
but
the...
the
second
question,
rule
24.
i
think
the
standard
is
that
you
could
bring
in
a
rule
24
party
within
supplemental
jurisdiction
that
doesn't
defeat
anything
with
respect
to
the
original
civil
action.
i
think
that
was
the
rule
prior
to
1367.
but
to
the
extent
it
was
or
wasn't,
i
think
1367(a)
and
(b)
combine
to
allow
that
to
happen.
(b)
then
says
that
if
someone
intervenes
as
a
party,
the
plaintiff
cannot
bring
a
claim
against
that...
that
intervening
party.
justice
souter,
you
asked
about
the
different
treatment
between
the
amount-in-controversy
requirement
and
the
geography
requirement.
if
there
is
a
distinction...
and
i
don't
think
this
provision
allows
any
kind
of
meaningful
distinction
between
the
two
as
it
applies
in
the
1367
context...
it
is
that
the
amount-in-controversy
requirement
is
more
important.
that's
what
zahn
held.
you
can
dispense
with
the
geography
requirement
in
ben
hur,
but
you
cannot
dispense
with
the
amount-in-controversy
requirement.
and
the
reason--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
except
it
does
because
the...
the
amount-in-controversy
requirement
keeps
a
lot
of
smaller
cases
out
of
federal
court
that
otherwise
would
be
in
there.
it
is
a
protection
of
this
court's
docket
and
all
the
federal
courts'
dockets,
and
that's
important.
and
that's
also
a
distinction
between
the
federal
question
cases
and
the
diversity
cases.
if
you
resolve
diversity
in
favor
of
driving
cases
to
state
court,
you
are
promoting
federalism
interests
because
state
courts
should
decide
law.
if
you
drive
more
cases
into
federal
courts
under
federal
question,
that's
right
because
you
think
federal
courts
are,
in
general,
better
suited
to
resolve
federal
courts...
federal
questions.
and
then
finally,
with
respect
to
the
remedy,
justice
ginsburg,
newman-green
says
you
can
simply
excise
some
parties
if
there
is
no
prejudice.
and
what
i
submit
to
you
is
we
have
a
case
that
has
been
litigated
from
day
one
without
jurisdiction
involving
more
than
1,000
plaintiffs.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
except
that
this
court
in
dataflux
didn't
send
it
back.
this
court
in
dataflux
decided
that
the
right...
in
grupo
dataflux
that
the
right
answer
is
that
the
remedy
for
this
mistake
is
the
dismissal
certainly
of
the
class,
but
i
think
frankly
the
dismissal
of
the
entirety
of
the
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that's...
and
that's
what
the
district
court
held
in
zahn,
which
is
the
reason
the
district
court
didn't
allow
this
case
to
come...
didn't
allow
this
to
go
forward
as
a
class
action.
and
that's
important
to
remember.
this
court
didn't
say
you
dismiss
out
anything
in
zahn.
zahn
came
up
without
it
being
a
class
action.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
class
action.
it
came
up
trying
to
reinstate
it.
this
court
said
you
can't
reinstate
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
