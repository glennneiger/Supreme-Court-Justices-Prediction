mr.
donald
b.
ayer
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
have
a
little
bit
different
view
i
think
of
the
statute
than
the
other
counsel
arguing
this
morning.
we...
we
believe
that
the
statute
actually
makes
quite
a
lot
of
sense,
and
we
also
believe
emphatically
that
it
does
not
reverse
the
complete
diversity
requirement.
i
think
the
clearest
indication
of
the
incorrectness
of
mr.
phillips'
and
mr.
long's
position
is
the
comparative
treatment
under
their
reading
of
the
federal
question
case
that
is
in
federal
court
and
the
diversity
case.
under
their
reading,
it's
perfectly
clear...
and
i
think
everyone
agrees...
that...
that
when
additional
claims,
as
in
the
city
of
chicago
case,
are
joined
with
a
federal
question
case
and
they
are...
they
relate
to
the
same
subject
matter,
that
it
will,
in
fact...
they
will
be
within
the
supplemental
jurisdiction.
most
importantly,
for
purposes
of
this
comparison,
they
will
not
destroy
the
original
jurisdiction
over
a
civil
action
even
though
they
are
claims
that
are
not
themselves
within
the
original
jurisdiction.
somehow
or
other,
the
argument
is
advanced
that
when
you
have
a
diversity
case
in
federal
court
where
all
parties
are
diverse
and
there
is
the
jurisdictional
amount
satisfied
and
you
bring
in
other
parties
who
do
not
destroy
complete
diversity
and
therefore
do
not
destroy
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
over
the
initial
matter
that
was
before
it...
somehow
or
other
the
argument
is
advanced
that
the
jurisdiction
over
the
civil
action
in
that
situation
is
destroyed
even
though
it
is
not
destroyed
in
the
federal--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--no,
no.
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i...
i
must
have
misspoke.
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that...
that
in
the
case
where
a...
a
diverse
additional
plaintiff
comes
in
to
bring
a
claim--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--yes.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct.
i'm...
i'm
drawing...
effectively
what...
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
this
distinction
between
the
federal
question
case
joined
with
cases
that
are
not
within
the
original
jurisdiction
and
the
diversity
case,
which
is
clearly
within
the
original
jurisdiction,
because
all
parties
are
diverse,
but
it
is
joined
with
claims
that
are
below
the
jurisdictional
amount,
so
that
they
are
not
within
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct,
your
honor.
the...
the
question...
i
think
the
difference
is
that
the
concept
of
complete
diversity,
which
this
court
for
200
years
has
articulated
as
in
the
statute
that
grants
diversity
jurisdiction
is
a
relational
concept.
in
order
to
determine
whether
you
have
jurisdiction
over
any
parties
in
a
case,
you
must
look
at
all
of
the
parties
in
the
case.
with
regard
to
amount
in
controversy,
it's
perfectly
clear,
and...
and
1367
changes
nothing
about
the
fact
that
1332
jurisdiction
requires
meeting
the
amount
in
controversy.
but
if
1367
has
conferred,
as
it
has,
supplemental,
additional
jurisdiction,
then
the
question
that
has
to
be
asked
is,
does
the
fact
that
a
party
coming
in
with
what
is
otherwise
a
supplemental
claim...
does...
does
the
presence
of
that
party
destroy
the
original
jurisdiction
that
exists
where
the
new
party
coming
in
is
diverse
but
doesn't
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i...
i
will.
well,
i
will.
i'll
respond
in
terms
of
the
city
of
chicago.
city
of
chicago
is
a
case
where
you
have
issues,
claims
within
the
federal
question
jurisdiction.
additional
claims
in
the
case
arise
under
state
law.
they
are
not
within
the
federal
question
jurisdiction,
but
they
are
related
to
the
same
case
or
controversy.
the
court
said,
with
no
difficulty,
both
for
purposes
of
1367
and
for
purposes
of
1441,
that
is
a
case
within
the
original
jurisdiction.
it's
a
civil
action.
in
both
statutes,
the
same
language.
it's
a
civil
action
within
the
original
jurisdiction.
and...
and
if
that
is
the
case,
in
a
federal
question
case...
i
think
i
want
to...
i'm
going
to
get
to
the
important
point
here.
this
court
has
many,
many
decisions
and
many
other
courts
have
many
decisions
saying
emphatically
that
when
you
add
a
party
or
when
there
is
a
party
in
a
case
who
destroys
complete
diversity,
the
court
loses
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
matter.
to
my
knowledge,
the
last
time
the
court
said
it
as
a
holding
was
in
the
schacht
case
a
few
years
ago.
there
are,
i
think,
dozens
of
cases
from
this
court.
we
cite
about
five
of
them
on
page
24
and
25
of
our
blue
brief.
that
is
a
fundamental
principle
and
it
is
because
the
concept
of
complete
diversity
is
a
relational
concept.
it
depends
on
who
the
parties
are
in
the
case.
as
has
been
said
many
times,
the
requirement
of
amount
in
controversy
is
individual.
the
fact
that
a
party
submits
a
complaint
and
the
complaint
has
one
party,
as
in
our
case,
whose
claim
comes
within
the
diversity
jurisdiction
and
includes
other
parties
who
we
agree
their
claims
do
not
come
within
the
original
jurisdiction...
does
the
fact
that
those
claims
are
all
put
on
the
same
piece
of
paper,
put
on
a
complaint,
does
that
mean
the
court,
the
trial
court,
lacks
jurisdiction
over
the
first
claim
as
to
which
all
the
requirements
are
met?
there
are
no
nondiverse
parties
here.
we
have
complete
diversity.
we
have
a
claimant
who
meets
the
jurisdictional
amount.
we
have
a
civil...
a
civil
action
within
the
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i'll...
i'll
give
you
an
example
of
a
situation
that
is
often
trotted
out
as
a
problem
under
our
reading
of
the
statute,
and
we
think...
the
irony
of
it
is,
i
think,
none
of
the
parties
actually
think
it's
a
problem,
and
i
certainly
don't,
and
that
is,
the
problem
of
a
rule
20
plaintiff
who
is
not
listed
in
(b).
but
let's
just
say
a...
a
plaintiff
comes
in
and
files
a...
a
complaint.
there
is
complete
diversity.
clever
plaintiff
says,
aha,
here
i
am.
i've
gotten
through
(a).
we're
in
court.
now,
i'm
in
(b)
and
i
am...
i'm
a
rule
20.
i'm
going
to
add
some
rule
20
plaintiffs,
and
i've
got
these
folks
who
are
not
diverse
and
we're
going
to
bring
them
in.
well,
we...
we
have
cited
cases,
i
think
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
where
it's
perfectly
clear
that
no
court,
i
think,
in
its
right
mind
is
going
to
turn
around
2
weeks
later
and
say,
oh,
you
got
me.
you
know,
we're
going
to
have
to
let
these
nondiverse
plaintiffs
in.
we're
going
to
have
to
go
forward
with
this
case
because
you
did
it
in
the
right
order.
if
you
had
filed
it
all
in
one
complaint,
you'd
be
out
of
court,
but
you're
a
clever
guy
and
you
filed
it
in
two
different
steps.
so
supplemental
jurisdiction.
you
come
in.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we...
we
disagree
with
that.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i...
we
agree
entirely
with
the
first
part
of
what...
what
your
honor
has
said.
we...
we
agree
completely
that
the
complete
diversity
requirement,
which
has
been
articulated
so
many
times,
means
that
when
you
bring
in
a...
a
nondiverse
party,
it
destroys
jurisdiction.
there
is
not
a
single
case
from
this
court
or
that
i
know
of
any
other
court
that
states
that
the
jurisdiction
over
the
original
action
is
destroyed.
one
of
the
things
that
was
said
here
very...
somewhat
cleverly
this
morning
is
that
in
zahn
the...
the
case
was
not
allowed
to
go
forward
because
of
the
presence
of
these
other
parties.
that
isn't
what
they
said.
three
different
times
in
zahn
the
court
said
these
parties
must
be
dismissed.
there
is
no
jurisdiction
over
these
parties
whose
claims
are
small.
they
are
out.
no
one
ever
said,
oh,
my
goodness,
we're
going
to
lose
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
every
time
this
issue
arises
in
the
context
of...
of
complete
diversity,
the
court
says,
oh,
my
goodness,
we
don't
have
jurisdiction.
we
can't
hear
any
part
of
this.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that
is
correct.
and...
and
i
would
just
like
to
go
on
and
say
one
other
thing,
and
that
is,
this
court
has
written
how
many
hundreds
i
don't
know,
but
hundreds
of
cases
articulating
nuances...
and...
and
i've
learned
how
remarkable
they
are,
the
nuances...
of
law
under
1332
and
under
what
amounts
to
a
case
within...
it's
incredible
how
complex
the
law
that
this
court
has
spelled
out
is
under
1332.
our
view
of
the
statute
is
that
that
body
of
law
has
been
preserved
and
it's
been
preserved
in
two
places.
it
has
been
preserved
in
the
first
clause
of
1367(a),
which
is
really
all
that's
at
issue
right
here,
and
it's
also
been...
been
preserved
in
the
last
clause
of
1367(b)
which
says
that...
that
as
to
the
list
of
enumerated
exceptions...
in
essence,
(b)
says
if
you've
got
a
case
within
the
original
jurisdiction,
then
it
says,
with
regard
to
plaintiffs'
claims
against
parties
joined
under
14,
19,
20,
and
24
and
with
regard
to
claims
brought
by
persons
to
be
joined
under
19
or
24,
then
you
don't
have
supplemental
jurisdiction
if
to
do
so
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
requirements
of
jurisdiction
under
1332.
what
does
that
mean?
that
means
that
those
excepted
claims
may
not
come
in
if
they
could
not
have
been
brought
in
the
case
originally
without
destroying
original
jurisdiction
under
1332.
it
can't
possibly
mean,
as
our
opponents
i
think
read
it,
that
the
only
time
you
have
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
these
claims
is
when
you
already
have
1332
jurisdiction
over
these
claims.
that
isn't
supplemental
jurisdiction.
it
would
make
absolutely
no
sense
to
read
the
statute
that
way.
so
how
do
we
read
it?
we
read
it
to
say
if
these
are
claims
whose
presence
in
the
case
at
the
beginning
would
have
destroyed
the
anchor
that
gets
us
into
court,
which
is
a
case
under
1332,
then
the
whole
thing
goes
out
the
window.
and
furthermore,
i
would
say...
and
again,
this
is
not
an
easy
point
to
spell
out
in
all
of
its
nuances,
but
at
any
point
in
the
case,
which
will
not
be
many
and
won't
be
often...
but
at
any
point
in
the
case
where
this
court's
cases
would
say
that
you
just
lost
jurisdiction
under
1332...
and
i
say
that's
not
often
because
basically
there's
a
time
of
filing
rule
and
there
are
many,
many,
as
you
all
know
better
than
i...
there
are
many
nuances
as
to
what
exceptions
exist
to
that
and
what
don't.
but
the
bottom
line
is
if
the
case
falls
out
of
1332
jurisdiction,
such
as
when
the
clever
plaintiff
tries
to
join
a
rule
20
compadre
to
come
in
and
bring
a
nondiverse
claim,
goodbye.
you're
out
of
court
because--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i...
i
just
think
that
the
whole
statute
makes
a
very
great
deal
of
sense.
i
mean,
one
question
is,
does
the
first
clause
of
(a)...
is...
is
that
a
gate
you
have
to
get
through
and
once
you
get
through
it,
you're
done?
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
i
think...
i
think
clearly
you've
got
to
have
a
case
within
the
original
jurisdiction
under
1332,
and
if
you
lose
it,
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
is
a
tail
that
falls
off.
it...
it
goes
away.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
clark,
of
course,
is
a
federal
question
case.
clark
is
a
case
at...
at
the
time
when
there
was
an
amount-in-controversy
requirement.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
right.
i...
i
understand,
your
honor.
i...
i
think...
i
mean,
i...
i
would...
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we
have
to
say
that
the
statute
did
what
it
did,
and...
and
if...
if
it
reversed
zahn,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
certainly
reversed...
reversed
clark,
and
frankly,
we
think
the
conclusion
is
easier
for
all
of
the
reasons
based
in
the
statute.
one
thing
i
would
like
to
do
before...
before
the
light
goes
off
here
is...
is
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
legislative
history.
and
of
course,
our
position
first...
in
the
first
instance
is
that
there
really
isn't
any
reason
to
consider
it
because
this
is
not
a
statute
that
destroys
complete
diversity.
it
doesn't
do
anything
radical.
it
actually
is
quite
sensible
and
limited
and
clear
when
you
read
it.
so
we
don't
think
you
need
to
go
to
it.
but
if
the
court
is
going
to
go
to
it,
we
would
submit
that
there
is
a
far
more
sensible
way
of
thinking
about
the
legislative
history
than
grabbing
one
sentence
out
of
the
house
report,
which
i'll
talk
about
in
a
minute
as
to
what
significance
it
really
has
anyway.
but
essentially
the
sequence
of
events
here...
and
i'll
try
to
go
through
it
quickly...
is
that
you...
and
as
mr.
stearns
said,
you
have
basically
three
versions
of
this...
of
this
enactment.
the
last
one
got
tweaked
a
little
bit
at
the
end.
the
first
version
is
the...
is
the
subcommittee
report.
and
as
he
indicated,
the
subcommittee
report,
which
actually
appears
at
page
14
and
15
of
our
brief,
of
our
yellow
brief...
if
you
read
the
text
of
(a),
which
appears
on
page
14,
what
you
see
is
language
which
on
its
face
clearly
does
reverse
zahn,
and
then
you
have
the
commentary
that
went
with
it
in
the
working
papers
to
the
subcommittee,
and
that
commentary
could
not
have
been
more
emphatic
of...
of
the
intent
to
reverse
zahn.
the
second
enactment,
which
we
have
put
in
an
addendum
to
our
yellow
brief
because
it,
frankly,
plays
little
role
in
the
case
in...
in
thinking
through
the
statute,
is
the
section
120
of
house
resolution
5381.
and
essentially
when
congress...
it's
quite
correct
that
the
federal
courts
study
committee
did
not
specifically
endorse
the
subcommittee
proposal.
it
passed
it
along,
saying
it
wasn't
taking
a
position.
when
it
got
to
congress,
from
somewhere
a
new
enactment
came
forward
onto
the
floor
or
onto
the
committee
that
was
addressing
it,
and
that's
this
provision
in
the
addendum
of
our
yellow
brief.
and
all
i'm
going
to
say
about
that
is
that
when
you
look
at
that,
number
one,
it
looks
entirely
different.
number
two,
it
actually
does
a
much
poorer
job
of
preserving
complete
diversity,
and
it
does,
in
fact,
explicitly
overrule
owen
equipment
v.
kroger.
judge
weis
came
in
and
testified
and
said,
that's
bad,
don't
do
that.
you
know,
you've
got
to
show
more
respect
for
complete
diversity,
and...
and
you
shouldn't
do
that.
that
got
put
into
the
ash
can.
so
that's
the
end
of
120.
and
the
next
thing
he
did,
attached
to
his
same
testimony,
was...
was
submit
a
proposal,
which
is
in
our
yellow
brief
at
page
16.
and
this...
this
is
what
we
said
we
think
you
should
enact.
if
you
compare
the
language
of
(a)
with
the
language
of
(a)
in
the
enactment
on
page
14,
you
will
see
that
it's
a
couple
lines
longer.
it
has
a
few
more
embellishments
and
words,
but
it
is
substantively
indistinguishable,
the
provision
in
(a).
and
so
what
we
have
is
judge
weis
putting
forward
a
proposal
that
can't
be
substantively
distinguished
from
the
one
that
the
subcommittee
said,
clearly
correctly,
would
reverse
zahn.
the
last
question
here
is
what
happened
then,
and
what
happened
then
to
provision
(a)...
there
are
essentially
three
things
that
happened
to
this
whole
provision
that
i'm
aware
of.
one
is
they
took
out
the
words,
on
a
claim,
and
that's
the
argument
that's
principally
advanced
here.
they
took
those.
so
it's
civil
action
on
a
claim.
they
took
out
on
a
claim.
they
also
changed
the
last
clause
of
(b)
and
they
also
changed
the
reference
in
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
from
case
or...
from...
what
is
the...
the
transaction
or
occurrence
to
case
or
controversy.
and
those
are
all
the
changes.
we
would
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
to
infer
from
any
of
those
things,
and
particularly
not
the
first
one
that
dealt
with
(a),
that
they
meant
by
dropping
on
a
claim
to
somehow
say,
oh,
my
goodness,
you've
got
to
have
jurisdiction
over
all
of
the
claims
before
you.
again,
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
court's
opinion
in
city
of
chicago.
you
can't
come
out
the
same
way
in
city
of
chicago
if
the
presence
of
a
nonjurisdictional
claim
destroys
original
jurisdiction
over
the
civil
action.
the
last
thing
i...
i
want
to
say
about
the...
the
jurisdiction
which
the
other
side
relies
upon...
essentially
it's
a
sentence
that
says
there
was
no
intent
to,
quote,
affect
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
1332
in
diversity-only
class
actions.
and
then
there's
a
cite,
a
footnote
to
zahn
and
ben
hur.
that's
pretty
much
what
there
is
that
they
talk
about.
well,
number
one,
as
has
been
said,
the
authors...
apparently
the
authors
of
that
language,
the
ones
who
put
it
in
conceded
that
this
legislative
history
was
an
attempt
to
correct
an
oversight
in
the
statute,
which
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
corrected
in
the
statute.
we
think
that's
significant.
but
i
would
go
beyond
that
and
say
that
if
you
just
look
at
this
language,
no...
no
intent
to
affect
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
1332
in
diversity-only
class
actions,
number
one,
most
importantly,
we
don't
think
there's
been
a
change
in
the
requirements
under
1332.
as
i've
said
before,
this
statute
engrafted
this
court's
entire
body
of
1332
jurisprudence
in
the
first
line
of...
of
clause
(a)
and
in
the
last
line
of
clause
(b),
and
so
it's
all
there.
no
one
has
changed
1332.
this
is
supplemental
jurisdiction
additional
to
it.
and
secondly,
this
is
not
a
class
action.
there's
nothing
in
our
case
that
relates
to
a
class
action.
that's
an
issue,
if
you
think
this
is
relevant,
you
have
to
deal
with
in...
in
the
other
case,
but
you
don't
have
to
deal
with
it
in
our
case.
i
guess
the
last
thing
i
would
say
about
legislative
history
is
that
we
think
probably
the
most
important
legislative
history
here,
other
than
the
tracking
of
these
provisions,
which
we
think
is
quite
indicative,
is...
is
that
the...
the
house
report,
among
other
things,
also
said
that
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
to
provide,
quote,
a
practical
arena
for
the
resolution
of
an
entire
controversy.
and
we
think
that
in
the
context
of
our
case,
as...
as
has
been
pointed
out
here
already
by
justice
ginsburg,
it
makes
very
little
sense
to
resolve
our
case
by
splitting
it
in
two
and
sending
it
to
different
courts.
thank
you
very
much.
