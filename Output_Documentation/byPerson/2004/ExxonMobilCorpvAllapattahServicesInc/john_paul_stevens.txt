justice
john
paul
stevens
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
two
different
cases:
exxon
mobil
against
allapattah
and
ortega
against
star-kist
foods.
mr.
phillips.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
can't
it
make
an
adjustment
in
this
case,
mr.
phillips.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
can't
it
make
an
adjustment
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
is
that
the
minimum?
wouldn't
the
minimum
be
just
to
dismiss
those
parties
who
don't
have
the
aggregate...
the
necessary
jurisdictional
amount?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
do
have
cases
where
a
complaint
is
filed
seeking
to
be
a
class
action
and
then
the
district
judge
does
not
certify
the
class
and
the
case,
nevertheless,
goes
forward.
now,
why
couldn't
you
do
that
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe.
why
isn't
it
permissible
just
to
dismiss
those
parties
who
don't
have
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount?
that's
what
i...
where
i
stumble
with
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
long.
mr.
long,
you
represent
the
respondent
in
the
second
case.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
long.
mr.
stearns,
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
thought
the
committee
report
said
we
do
not
intend
to
overrule
zahn.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
not
the
house
committee
report
say
we
do
not
intend
to
overrule
zahn?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
it?
am
i
correct
or
incorrect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right,
and
that
was
also
the
same
report
that
was
filed
in
the
senate
proceedings
as
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think...
i
think
you're
overstating
what
they
say
in
the
article.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
sure
he
said
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
did
he
say
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
footnote
to
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
in
an
opinion
written
after
the
statute
was
adopted.
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
a
direct
quote
of
the
house
report,
i
might
find
out.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say
that's
not
a
direct
quote
of
the
house
report.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
they
were
being
intellectually
honest
in
their
law
review
or
do
you
think...
accuse
them
of
something
other
than
honesty
in
what
they
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
agree
that
if
they're
right
on
the
interpretation
of
1367,
the
judgment
has
to
be
reversed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
modify
the
question.
do
you
agree
that
if
they're
correct,
the
entire
action
has
to
be
dismissed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
answer
is
no,
i
gather.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
stearns.
mr.
ayer,
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
ayer.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
another
4
minutes,
and
i
see
that
will
be
adjournment
time,
i
will
let
everyone
else
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
this...
these
cases
are
submitted.
we'll
hear
argument
in
the
next
case
at
one
o'clock.
