mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
what's
at
stake
here
is
whether
this
court
was
serious
in
the
finley
decision,
and
it's
interesting
that
it
was
a
5
to
4
decision,
in
which
four
of
you
concluded
that
pendent
party
jurisdiction
was
a
logical
extension
of
gibbs
and
five
among
you
concluded
that
it
was
not
up
for
this
court
to
make
that
determination,
that
only
congress
could
make
that
determination,
and
in
the
200
years
of
history
of
the
federal
courts
that
had
preceded
finley,
that
the
track
record
of
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
in
expanding
federal
jurisdiction
had
been
a
rocky
one.
but
you
weren't
going
to
do
it
anymore.
now,
that
wasn't
the
first
time
this
court
had
said
those
words,
we're
not
going
to
do
it
anymore,
but
it
was
said
in
a
way
that
got
somebody's
attention.
and
if
there
was
a
surprise,
it
was
within
a
year
congress
did
precisely
what
you
asked
them
to
do.
they
adopted
1367,
and
they
did
it
in
the
way
that
congress
does
things.
it's
better
not
to
watch.
they
don't
necessarily
explain
it
carefully.
they
don't
do
it
in
an
organized
and
comprehensive
way.
it
is
a
matter
that
was
of
great
interest
to
a
small
number
of
people
and
of
no
interest
to
the
great
body
politic.
let's
face
it.
diversity
jurisdiction
is
of
great
interest
to
you
and
me;
it's
of
little
interest
to
the
people
until
they're
hauled
into
court
and
find
that
only
part
of
their
case
can
be
there.
and
when
we
look
at
the
history
of
federal
jurisprudence,
what
do
we
see?
we
see
that
the
history
of
this
court
has
been
largely
to
allow
defendants
hauled
into
court
to
ignore
rules
that
we
once
thought
were
sacrosanct,
for
example,
the
notion
of
destruction
of
jurisdiction.
and
in
law
school
we
all
learned
about
destruction
of
jurisdiction.
it
doesn't
apply.
when
a
defendant
is
brought
into
court,
we
ignore
strawbridge.
we
did
because
this
court
and
other
circuit
courts
said
you
could.
and
incidentally,
when
they're
brought
into
court,
they're
brought
into
the
same
civil
action
as
any
plaintiff
or
defendant
in
the
original
complaint.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
any
claim,
your
honor,
that's
brought
in
in
a
third
party
practice,
any
claim
that's
brought
in
an
additional
party
claim
is
part
of
the
same
civil
action.
there's
only
one
form
of
action.
all
the
claims
are
in
that
one
form
of
action.
the
importance
of
this,
incidentally,
is
that
their
entire
argument
depends
on
interpretation
of
the
two
words,
civil
action.
does
the
district
court
have
original
jurisdiction
over
a
civil
action
if
the
civil
action
includes
claims
over
which
there's
clearly
original
jurisdiction
and
claims
where
there
is
not?
now,
historically...
incidentally,
exxon
has
to
basically
make
new
law,
and
they
do
it
by
saying
that
zahn
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there's
no
jurisdiction
over
a
class
action
which
includes
smaller
claimants.
i...
i
dare
you
to
read
zahn
and
find
those
words.
they
don't
exist.
all
zahn
says,
all
snyder
said,
which
preceded
it,
is
that
every
class
member's
claim
must
be
viewed
individually.
now,
that's
a
very
interesting
conclusion.
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
say
there's
no
jurisdiction
over
the
class
action.
it
simply
says
the
claims
of
the
absent
class
members
who
don't
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount
should
be
dismissed.
now,
interesting,
look
at
the
language
in
1332.
it
says
the
district
courts
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
all
civil
actions
where
the
matter
in
controversy
exceeds
the
sum
or
value
of
$75,000.
well,
when
we
read
that
statute
and
we
apply
zahn
and
snyder,
we
say
civil
action
doesn't
mean
the
aggregate
of
all
claims.
there
we
say
what
it
means
is
we
must
evaluate
each
individual
claim
to
determine
if
each
individual
claim
within
the
civil
action
meets
the
jurisdictional
minimum
of
the
diversity
statute.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
indeed.
that
was
prior
to
the--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--i'd--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--well--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--isn't
it
interesting,
your
honor,
that
what
drove
1367
was
this
court's
decision
in
finley?
and
what's
interesting
about
the
argument
that
exxon
makes
here
is
that
finley
discussed
the
words
civil
action.
and
in
fact,
what
finley
said
in
civil
action
is
rejected,
the
very
argument
exxon
makes
here--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--justice
breyer,
i...
i
agree
that--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--let...
let
me
tell
you--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--well,
i...
i
was
going
to
agree
and
disagree.
i
agree
that
finley
was
a
federal
question
case.
that,
however,
doesn't
go
to
the
point
of
what
this
court
said
about
the
words,
civil
action.
what
you
said
was
the
1948
recodification
came
relatively
soon
after
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
which
provide
that
there
shall
be
one
form
of
action
to
be
known
as
civil
action.
consistent
with
this
new
terminology,
the
'48
revision
inserted
the
expression,
civil
action,
throughout
the
provisions
governing
district
court
jurisdiction.
and
what
the
court
held
is
there's
no
meaning
to
those
words,
especially
when
the
revision
is
more
naturally
understood
as
stylistic.
so
the
words,
civil
action...
and
when
you
look
at
1332,
which
is
what
zahn
is
based
on,
if
their
interpretation
of
the
words,
civil
action,
was
correct,
then
zahn
was
wrongly
decided
and
snyder
was
wrongly
decided.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
indeed,
your
honor,
but
if
their
argument
was
correct,
that
the
civil
action
bundled
the
claims,
as
they
suggest,
then
zahn
was
wrongly
decided.
then
the
amount
in
controversy
in
zahn
was
the
totality
of
all
the
claims.
in
other
words,
to
preserve
zahn,
which
concluded
that
the
civil
action
word
means
an
individual
analysis
of
every
claim
within
it,
to
preserve
that
conclusion,
they
have
to
argue
the
opposite
conclusion
that
the
words,
civil
action,
mean
all
the
claims
are
aggregated.
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
the
historical
practice
of
this
court--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--their...
well,
your
honor,
respectfully,
congress
created
two
doors.
and
they
have
a...
a
door
which
is
the
door
that
existed
under
the
constitution,
which
is
article
iii
jurisdiction.
you
can
come
in
as
a
diversity
plaintiff
into...
into
the
courthouse.
now,
congress
says
there's
another
door.
congress
went
through
and
cleaned
up
200
years
of
federal
court
jurisprudence.
and
incidentally,
it
is
anathema
to
law
professors
who
have
written
books
and
tomes
and
lectured
to
law
students,
your
honor,
who
don't
understand
what
they're
reading.
the
notion
that
in
1367
in
one
page,
congress
could
write
down
everything
you
needed
to
know
about
supplemental
jurisdiction
is
horrifying
to
a
host
of
law
professors--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--well--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--well,
and
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor,
because
let
me
start
with
the
first
premise.
three
law
professors
didn't
write
this
article...
didn't
write
this
language.
that's
incorrect.
the
article
is
written
by
a
subcommittee
of
the
federal
courts
study
committee
that
was
chaired
by
judge
posner.
judge
posner
is
the
author
of
one
of
the
decisions
that
affirms
the...
has
the
same
view
as
the
eleventh
circuit.
judge
posner
had
a
member
of
his
subcommittee,
mr.
kastenmeier,
who
was
a
representative
who
just
so
happened
to
be
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
subcommittee
that
presented
this
language.
what
happened--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--but--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--that's
partially
correct,
but
significantly
incorrect,
your
honor.
the
subcommittee
specifically
said
zahn
was
wrong
and
wrote
language
to
overrule
zahn.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
respectfully,
your
honor,
you
have
to
follow
it
through.
the
subcommittee
said
we
intend
to
overrule
zahn.
the
words
in
this
statute
were
written
by
the
people
who
said
we
intend
to
overrule
zahn.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
it
goes
to
the
full
committee.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
no.
actually
the
subcommittee
report
said
we
did,
of
the
federal
courts
study
committee.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
what
the
house
committee--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--the
house
report--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--yes,
said
we
do
not
intend
to
overrule
zahn,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
well,
it
is
the
report
that
was
filed
in
the
senate.
it
has
a
footnote
that
says
we
don't
intend
to
overrule
zahn
or
ben
hur--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--which
i
think
everybody
has
concluded
are
mutually
exclusive
positions,
but
that's
what
it
said.
but,
your
honor,
respectfully,
we
now
know,
because
they've
all
written
law
review
articles,
that
the
people
that
wrote
the
house
report,
because
they've
said
it,
wrote
those
law...
wrote
those
words
because
they
knew
that
the
language
did
overrule
zahn
and
they
didn't
want
to
achieve
that
outcome.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
well,
your
honor,
respectfully,
what
we
do
have
is
undisputed
fact
here
because
if
you
see
judge
weis'
conclusion,
for
example,
judge
weis
is
one
of
the
people
who
has
adopted
one
of
the
opinions
opposing
our
view
of...
of
this
position.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
he
was.
and
judge
weis,
even
in
his
own
opinion,
acknowledges
that
his
subcommittee
that
wrote
the
language
intended
to
overrule
zahn.
and
so
what
he
says
is--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--he
does,
your
honor,
and
what
he
says
is--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--he
says
it
in
a
footnote,
and
he
says
he
was
unhappy--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--to
his
opinion
in
this...
in
the
decision.
it
will
take
me
a
second
to
find
it.
his
opinion
in
the
meritcare
v.
st.
paul.
in
a
footnote,
he
acknowledges...
what
he
says
is
he
was
upset
that--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
what
he
says--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--to
put
it
in
context,
the
subcommittee
of
the
federal
courts
study
committee
says
zahn
is
bad
law
and
doesn't
make
any
sense,
which
by
the
way,
respectfully,
i
think
it
is.
so
then
you
go
to
the
full
committee.
the
full
committee...
judge
weis
doesn't
like
diversity
jurisdiction
at
all.
he
wants
to
abolish
all
diversity
jurisdiction.
they
make
no
recommendations.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
precisely.
that's
the
point
he
makes
in
his
footnote.
he
acknowledges
what
the
subcommittee
did.
but
it's...
it's
important
to
know
representative
kastenmeier
was
a
member
of
this
subcommittee.
the
federal
courts
study
committee
is
not
congress.
it's
merely
an
advisory
body.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
well,
let's
take
those
points.
the
answer
is
you
make
the
change
that
congress
says
in
the
statute
you
should
make.
and
so
when
you
have
an--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--your
honor,
respectfully,
if
we
look
at
the
changes
that
were
adopted
in
1367,
not
a
single
one
of
the
ones
you're
hearing
argued
today
anybody
can
seriously
argue
are
significant.
for
example,
the
zahn
issue.
zahn
has
no
material
significance
on
litigation
in
the
federal
courts.
and
why
is
that?
it's
because
most
plaintiffs
don't
want
to
be
in
federal
court.
these
plaintiffs
are
different.
and
incidentally,
by
the
way,
this
is
not--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--your
honor,
respectfully,
this
court
has
been
looking
the
other
way
on
strawbridge
for
200
years,
and
what
congress
did
was
ratify
some
of
your
previous
abrogations
of
strawbridge
and
they
made
another
minor
adjustment.
and
you
know
what
it...
what
did
they
did
is,
again,
consistent
with
200
years
of
friendliness
to
defendants
in
federal
court.
the
whole
notion
of
diversity
jurisdiction--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--the
whole--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--indeed.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
precisely.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
your
honor,
respectfully--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--yes.
i
was
going
to
get
there,
your
honor,
but
in
fact,
your
honor,
respectfully,
i
hate
to
disagree
with
your
honor,
but
i
believe
you're
incorrect.
is
that
what
you
see
in
the
class
action
fairness
act,
for
example...
and
we
filed
it
in
our
brief...
the
house
and
senate
committee
reports
which
discussed
this
case
and
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
circuits
of
the
circuit
courts
have
agreed
with
our
view...
there
has
been
no
class
actions
of
any
materiality
filed.
in
fact,
they
made
the
note
in
1999
or
'97
more
class
actions
were
certified
in
one
county
in
illinois
than
filed
and
certified
in
the
entire
federal
system.
and
the
reason
they
said
that
is
because
most
plaintiffs
lawyers,
notwithstanding
zahn...
it
isn't...
zahn
isn't
the
issue.
snyder
was
the
issue.
it's
aggregation
that's
the
issue.
all
plaintiffs
lawyers
had
to
do
to
avoid
removal
is
simply
put
named
plaintiffs
that
don't
meet
the
jurisdictional
standards
for
diversity,
create
imperfect
diversity,
have
amounts
in
controversy
of
less
than
the
amount
in
controversy
required,
and
then
they
could
never
be
removed.
so
zahn
is
simply
a
footnote,
and
it
got
it...
all
the
billing
of
zahn,
zahn,
zahn...
the
reality
is
the
predecessor
to
zahn,
which
is
snyder
that
says
that
you
can't
aggregate
under
1332
the
amount
in
controversy,
that
was
the
significant
decision.
and
what
congress
has
now
done
a
few
weeks
ago
is
to
take
up
the
snyder
case
and
has
overruled
snyder.
and
what
they've
done
is
to
say,
when
there's
an
aggregate
claim
of
more
than
$5
million,
it
goes
into
federal
court.
but
look
at
what
congress
has
said.
look
at--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--but
snyder
was
a
class
action
case
that
says
you
cannot
aggregate
claims
under
1332.
and
so
what
snyder
says
is
because...
because
the
class
action
fairness
act
is
restricted
to
diversity
cases
or
diversity
type
cases,
what
it
says
is
that...
and,
therefore,
is
an
amendment
to
1332.
what
it
does
is
add
a
new
section
to
create
original
jurisdiction
in
diversity
cases
involving
class
claims.
and
incidentally,
the
significance
of
that
in
this
case
is...
justice
o'connor,
you
said
is
it
retroactive.
the
answer
is
yes
and
no.
it's
applicable
to
all
cases
filed
after
its
effective
date,
which
is
already
effective
as
of
a
couple
weeks
ago.
if
exxon
gets
dismissal
of
this
claim
and
gets
it
refiled,
we
will
be
applicable
to
the
class
action
fairness
act
and
be
right
back
in
federal
court
where
we
started.
and
so
what
you're
left
with
is
all
they're
really
looking
for
here
now
is
a
new
trial,
and
this
is
just
a
procedural
game
to
come
back.
but
there's
very...
one
important
point
i
want
to
make
to
you.
you
said
in
finley
we're
going
to
not
make...
do
this
with
jurisdiction
anymore.
we're
going
to
ask
congress
to
do
it.
and
congress
did
it.
and
so
you
read
1367
and,
respectfully,
it
is
clear.
every
court
that
read
it
at
a
certain
point
said
it
was
clear,
and
the
only
ambiguity
is
created
by
a
house
report
that
says,
notwithstanding
what
it
says,
we
meant
something
else.
that's...
the
ambiguity
is
not
created
by
the
statute,
but
by
an--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
i
paraphrased,
your
honor.
[laughter]
what
we're
left
with
here
in
this
circumstance
is
that...
that
what...
by
the
way,
what
you
clearly
have
in
the
legislative
history
is...
for
example,
they
obviously
made
a
comment,
a
joke
about
what
this
court
will
do
when
you
look
at
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
history
that
they
put
in
it.
and
by
the
way,
these
three
gentlemen
did
not
write
the
statute.
it
should
be
perfectly
clear.
they
were
there
observing
what
was
going
on
when
it
was
going
on.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
justice
stevens,
i
think
whether
it
is
or
not,
it
demonstrates
the
mistake
of
relying
upon
something
other
than
what's
in
the
plain
language
of
a
statute
because
once
you
begin
to
encourage
that
kind
of
game
to
be
played,
then
how
would
you
have
a
trial
over
whether
these
professors
were
being
honest
or
not?
what
do
we
know?
they
did
write
law
review
articles
and
they
did
pretty
much
admit
what
they
did.
now,
i
may
have
a
different
take
on
it
than
someone
else.
but
what
are
we
doing
here?
these...
these
plaintiffs
filed
this
lawsuit
in
federal
court.
they
didn't
go
to
madison
county,
illinois
to
sue
one
of
the
largest
companies
in
the
world.
they
didn't
go
to
a
friendly
state
court
forum.
they
read
1367
to
say,
okay,
we
got
original
jurisdiction
here
under
1332
of
the
civil
action,
and
we
read
civil
action,
because
we
just
read
finley
and
finley
says
civil
action
are
just
words
of
art.
it
doesn't
mean
what
they
say
it
means.
so
we
filed
in
the
federal
court
and
through
the
second
door
come
these
supplemental
claims.
and
the
supplemental
claims
are...
are...
incidentally,
so
it's
perfectly
clear,
in
a
class
action
context
under
rule
23,
the
named
plaintiffs
represent
themselves
and
they
assert
their
own
claims,
all
of
which
were
within
the
jurisdictional
minimum,
and
they
represent
the
claims
of
unnamed
class
members
who
they
have
jurisdiction
over
those
claims
through
the
exercise
of
supplemental
jurisdiction.
any
way
you
cut
it,
this
case...
all
it
is
is
come
back
again
and
try
it
again.
it's
been
in
the
federal
courts
for
14
years.
14
years.
enough.
it's
over.
they
were
found
guilty.
judgment
should
be
entered.
and
incidentally,
that
last
point.
they
want
to
reverse
a
judgment.
there
is
no
judgment.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
there
is
no
judgment,
your
honor,
because
the
district
court
was
well
aware
of
the
issue
that
existed
here,
notwithstanding
his
disagreement
with
some
other
courts,
and
he
refused
to
enter
judgment
until
the
claims
process
went
through
where
it
was
determined
whether
each
claimant
was
above
or
below
the
jurisdictional
amount.
and
so
what
he
did
in
doing
that
was
to...
there
is
no
judgment
entered
and
he
said,
i'm
not
going
to
enter
final
judgment
until
this
process
is
over.
and
every
single
case--
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
--there's
no
case
that
is...
that
would
support
that
outcome,
including
the
cases
they
cite.
mr.
eugene
e.
stearns
the
answer
is
no.
newman-green
doesn't
say
that.
caterpillar
doesn't
say
that.
no
reported
case
says
that.
no
reported
case
has
ever
found
jurisdiction
destruction
in
a
jurisdictional
amount
case
ever
in
the
annals
of
federal
jurisprudence.
and
when
people...
you
invite
people
to
look
at
a
statute,
you
invite
congress
to
write
one,
and
people
look
at
it
and
read
it,
they
ought
to
be
able
to
rely
upon
it
and
not
what
some
staff
person
put
in
the
back
door
in
a
legislative
report
that's
inconsistent
with
the
words
of
the
statute
itself.
thank
you.
