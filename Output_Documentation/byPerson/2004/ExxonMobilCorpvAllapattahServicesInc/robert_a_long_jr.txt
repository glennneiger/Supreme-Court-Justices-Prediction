mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
justice
stevens.
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
three
basic
points.
first,
section
1367
does
not
alter
the
requirements
of
section
1332
for
original
jurisdiction
in
a
civil
diversity
action,
and
therefore,
the
plain
language
of
section
1367
does
not
alter
the
complete
diversity
requirement
or
the
requirement
that
each
plaintiff
in
a
diversity
action
must
have
more
than
$75,000
in
controversy.
second,
there
is
no
sound
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
two
jurisdictional
requirements
of
section
1332,
and
therefore,
if
section
1367
alters
the
matter-in-controversy
rule
of
zahn
and
clark,
it
also
alters
the
complete
diversity
rule
of
strawbridge.
and
third,
the
best
interpretation
of
section
1367
and
the
one
that
causes
the
least
harm
is
that
it
overturns
the
result
in
finley
and
otherwise,
with
a
few
exceptions,
codifies
the
pre-finley
understanding
of
supplemental
jurisdiction.
now,
our...
our
primary
argument
has
already
been
addressed,
and
i
don't
want
to
waste
time
on
it
but
it
is
crucial,
critical
to
our
argument.
and
that
is,
that
the
language
of
1367(a)
is
that
supplemental
jurisdiction
is
conferred
but
only
in
a
civil
action,
of
which
the
district
courts
have
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
yes.
i
mean,
basically
each...
as
to
each
plaintiff,
they
must
be
diverse
from
each
defendant
and
each--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
what
the
plain
language...
and...
and
here
we
are,
i
think...
we
can
rely
on
plain
language.
what
1367(a)
says
is
that
in
each
case
you
must
look
to
some
other
statute
that
confers
original
jurisdiction.
it
can
be
1331.
it
can
be
1332.
and
of
course,
although
those
statutes
use
the
same
term,
original
jurisdiction,
there
are...
there's
decisional
law
that
comes
along--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
but
i
think
it's
the
same
answer.
original
jurisdiction
and
civil
action
are
found...
each
of
those
terms
is
found
in
1331
and
1332.
and
i
do
think
it
comes
out
of
this
court's
decisions
that
if
you
have
a
federal
question...
so
you're
claiming
original
jurisdiction
under
1331...
then
yes,
that
is
sufficient
to
give
original
jurisdiction
over
the
action.
that
is
what
the
court
held
in
the
city
of
chicago
case.
but
it
really
can't
be
the
same
in
a
diversity
case
if,
for
example,
there's
going
to
be
complete
diversity.
what...
what
the
courts
have
said
that
have
thought
that
the
plain
language
of
1367
compels
this
result
that
zahn
and...
and
also
strawbridge
go,
they
say
look,
the
only
way
we
can
read
this
is
if
there's
original
jurisdiction
of...
of
one
claim
by
one
plaintiff
against
one
defendant,
then
we've
got
original
jurisdiction
over
the
civil
action.
then
we're
into
supplemental
jurisdiction
and
all
we
ask
is...
is
that
within
the
same
case
or
controversy,
and
then
there
are
some
exceptions
in
(b).
but--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
of
course,
our
case
is
not
a
class
action,
but...
but
we
would
say
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--or...
yes,
exactly.
it
carries
forward
the
rules
of
party
joinder
under
1332.
strawbridge
is
an
interpretation
of
what
is
now
1332,
the
requirements
for
original
jurisdiction.
there
has
to
be
complete
diversity.
you
can't
simply
look
at
one
plaintiff
and
one
defendant--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
didn't
bring--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--class
action
fairness
act.
well,
but
i
think
that
in...
in
a
way
it...
it
shows
what
congress...
when
congress
means
to
amend
section
1332
and
make
exceptions
to
these
requirements
for
original
jurisdiction
under
1332--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i...
i
think
you
could
fairly
say
the...
the
new
statute
reflects
a
judgment
by
congress
that
in
these
class
actions
of
national
importance,
which
meet
certain
requirements,
minimal
diversity
should
be
sufficient.
and,
of
course,
that's
constitutionally
permissible.
but
i
don't
think
there's
been
any
suggestion
that
in
the...
the
more
run-of-the-mill
cases
there
ought
to
be
simply
minimal
diversity.
i
mean,
there...
there
are
millions,
literally
millions,
of
civil
actions
filed
in
state
courts
each
year.
about
60,000
end
up
in
the
federal
courts
on
the
diversity
side
of
the
docket.
if
even
1
percent
of
those
cases
moves
over
to
federal
court,
that's
going
to
be
a
doubling
of
the
federal
courts'
diversity
docket,
which
is
about
half
the
trials.
so...
and
i
don't
think
there's
been
any
suggestion
by
congress...
and,
of
course,
complete
diversity
and
matter-in-controversy
are
the
two
rules
that
keep
that
from
happening.
now,
the...
the
class
actions
will
be
a
sufficient...
a
significant
additional
burden
on
the
federal
courts,
and
to
my
knowledge,
there
aren't
any
additional
resources
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
but
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
way...
the
way
this
was
understood
to
work--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--and
it's
in...
and
this
is
the
answer
to
the
point
that,
well,
there
can
never
be
any
supplemental
jurisdiction
on
our
view
in
a...
in
a
diversity
case.
yes,
there
can
because
in
a
variety
of
situations...
and...
and
you've
named
where
there's
a
rule
14
third
party
claim
and
that's
by
a
defendant--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
before...
this...
this
is
exactly
an
excellent
example
because
it's
one
of
the
few
things
that
was
clearly
changed
by
1367,
and
it
was
changed
in
the
direction
of
narrowing
the...
the
jurisdiction.
the
understanding
was
that
you
could...
if
a
party
came
in
on
its
own
under
rule
24,
said
i...
i
can
intervene
of
right--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--but
they
were
coming
in
on
their
own...
that
was
allowed.
i
mean,
this
could
potentially
be
a
problem
under
this
rationale
of
kroger.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
it
would
otherwise--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--it...
it
would
be
allowed.
that
was
allowed
before.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
under
rule
19,
the
rule
was
that
you
couldn't
do
it
even
if--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--you
could
not,
and
the
idea
was
this
was
getting
too
close
to
the
kroger
problem--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--could
not.
it
was--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--the
kroger
problem
is
if
you...
you
certainly
couldn't
put
in
these
nondiverse
parties
in
the
initial
complaint.
and
of
course,
kroger
worried
about,
well,
the
plaintiff
leaves
them
out
and
then
they
come
in
in
a
second
stage,
and
that's
an
evasion
of
completed
diversity.
but
we
can
see
very
clearly
from
subsection
(b),
this
is...
this
is
one
part
of
the
statute
that
is
clear...
that
the...
it
has
now
been
changed
so
that
claims
by
persons
proposed
to
be
joined
as
plaintiffs
under
rule
19
or
rule
24
will
not
be
permitted
unless
they
can
satisfy
the
requirements
of
section
1332,
that
is,
complete
diversity
and
matter-in-controversy.
so
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
being
thought
about
in
the
statute.
the
fact
that
this
was
actually
not
permitted,
clearly
not
permitted,
shows
that
this
statute
is
very
concerned
about
preserving
the
requirements
of
complete
diversity
and
matter-in-controversy.
so
i
think
that's
actually
a
good
example
to
focus
on.
another
one...
sometimes
examples
help.
in...
in
the
owen--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--okay.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
what
would
happen
is...
i
mean,
you
wouldn't
get
to
that
stage,
justice
breyer,
because
you
wouldn't
let
the...
the
court
would
not
let
the
party
in.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
and
sometimes
you
have
to
dismiss
the
case--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--right,
because
you
won't
let
them
in.
now,
sometimes
you'll
have
to
dismiss
the
entire
case.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
if...
if
it
turns
out
that
the
party
is
indispensable
under
rule
19.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
right.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i...
i
may
have
misspoken.
what...
what
is
happening
here
in
(b)
is
that
it's
possible
for
parties
to
come
in
under
rules
14,
19,
20,
or
24.
we
think
the
reading
of
that
is
that
congress
wanted
to
allow
that.
so
it's
not
impermissible,
but
then
if
plaintiffs
want
to
turn
around
and
assert
a
claim
against
them,
it's
got
to
be
one
that
satisfies
complete
diversity
and
matter-in-controversy.
and
that's
to
protect
the
owen
equipment
rationale.
but
then--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
that...
well,
i
think
that's
correct,
if
the...
at
least
if
the
plaintiff
was
trying
to
bring
it
in.
you
may
have
got
me
to
a
point
where
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--give
you
the
exactly
right--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
it
would
be
easy
for
you
to
reach
it
with
me.
but...
but
the...
the
gist
of
it
is
certainly
if...
if
the...
if
the
party
is
coming
in
under
rule
19
as
a
plaintiff
or
you
can
come
in
as
a
defendant...
maybe
that's
the
answer.
that's...
that's
permissible.
you
can
join
parties
as
to
plaintiffs
or
defendants.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
right.
let
me...
let
me
try
another
simpler
example.
maybe
this
one
will
work
better.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
are
actually
cited
in
the
court's
opinion
in
owen
equipment,
and
they
give
a
sort
of
brief
summary
of
these
situations
in
which
you
could
actually
bring
in
extra
parties
and
claims
in
a
diversity
case
and
the
extra
parties
or
claims
would
not
be
satisfying
complete
diversity
or
matter-in-controversy,
and
yet
the
original
jurisdiction
of
section
1332
would
not
be
destroyed.
footnote
18
of
owen
equipment
cites
one
of
these
cases.
it's
called
scott
against
fancher.
it
was
a
fifth
circuit
case.
there
was
an
accident
with
three
trucks.
one
of
the
drivers
was
from
texas
and
the
other
two
were
from
oklahoma.
so
the...
their
case
was
brought
in
texas
against
the
two.
the
texas
drivers
sued
the
two
oklahoma
drivers,
so
there
was
complete
diversity.
it
did
meet
the
matter-in-controversy.
so
one
defendant
filed
a
compulsory
counterclaim.
that
was
one
of
the
examples,
and
this
is
all
mentioned
in
owen
equipment.
and
that
was
okay.
of
course,
the
citizenship
would
be
the
same,
but
no
question
about
whether
the
amount
in
controversy
was...
was
up
to
the
required
level.
and
they
also
filed
a...
a
cross
claim
against
the
other
defendant,
and
that
was
also
allowed.
and
again,
no...
of
course,
now
you
have
two
citizens
from
oklahoma.
so
that
would
not
be
complete
diversity,
but
that...
that
was
allowed.
and
again,
it's
because
the
defendants
are
bringing
in...
this
is
the
language
that
the
court
used
in
owen
equipment,
that
when
a
defendant
is
hailed
into
court
against
its
will,
then
some
of
these
ancillary
claims
are
going
to
be
permitted.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
and
i'm
thinking
again
this
all...
i
think
this
all
traces
back
to
owen
equipment
in
this
rationale
that
we're
not
going
to
allow
evasion
of
the
requirements
of
complete
diversity
in
matter-in-controversy
by
the
plaintiff.
and
i
think
there's
textual
evidence
in
1367
that
this
is
what
congress
was
doing.
i
mean,
if
you
look
in
subsection
(b),
you
can
find
textual
evidence
for
this
interpretation.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
it
refers
to
this
rule
14
situation,
the
impleader
of
a
third
party
defendant.
that
was
exactly
the
situation
that
was
at
issue
in
owen
equipment
against
kroger.
and
then
it
uses
this
somewhat
strange
language,
this
language
of
claims
by
plaintiffs
against
persons
made
parties
under
these
rules.
this
is
what
justice
breyer
was
getting
me
tripped
up
on
a
minute
ago.
but
the...
the
point
here
is
that
these
people
can
come
in.
i
mean,
this
language
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
if
they
can't
come
in
at
all.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
exactly.
that's...
and
so
there
is
work
to
be
done
in
subsection
(b)
even
in
a
diversity
case.
the
only
other
point
i'll
make
here
is
that
counterclaims
and
cross
claims
come
in
under
rule
13
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
there
is
actually
rule
13(h)
which
says
very
specifically
that
parties
may
be
brought
in...
additional
parties
may
be
brought
in
under
rules
19
and
20,
once
you
get
a
counterclaim
or
a
cross
claim
going.
so
that
is...
could
explain
why
there
are
these
references
to
rules
19
and
20,
as
well
as
14
and
24,
in
subsection
(b).
i
do
want
to
get
to
the
argument
that's
made
by...
or
the
petitioners
in
our
case,
which
is
really...
as
i
understand
their
argument,
they
accept
that
there
must
be
original
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
civil
action,
and
they
accept
that
that
means
that
there
must
be
complete
diversity.
but
then
they
say,
well,
matter-in-controversy
is
really
different.
it
should
be
treated
differently.
it
really
doesn't
go
to
whether
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
civil
action.
it
only
goes
to
whether
it
has
jurisdiction
over
a
particular
claim.
and
we
don't
think
that's
tenable.
and...
and
here
we
would
rely
on
statutory
language,
and
it's
the
language
of
section
of
1332,
which
sets
out
the
two
requirements
for
original
jurisdiction
of
a
civil
action.
strawbridge
is
an
interpretation
of
that
requirement.
to
have
original
jurisdiction
over
the
civil
action,
there
must
be
complete
diversity.
petitioners
agree
with
that.
the
decisions
like
zahn
and
clark
are
an
interpretation
of
the
other
requirement
to
have...
to
meet
the
matter-in-controversy
requirement,
and
to
have
original
jurisdiction
over
the
civil
action,
each
plaintiff
must
meet
that
requirement.
so--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
it's
not...
it's...
that
is
the
rule
of
zahn
and
clark
that
has
been
the
rule
for
many
decades.
yes,
the
problem
can
be
cured
by
dropping
some
of
the
plaintiffs.
that's
a
possibility,
but
you
cannot
have
this
piggy-backing,
bringing
in
additional
claims
that
are
jurisdictionally
insufficient.
you
can't
get
around
strawbridge
and
complete
diversity
that
way,
and
you
can't
get
around
the
matter-in-controversy
that
way
either.
they...
they
are
parallel
in
the
language
of
1332.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
you've
made
a
number
of
points.
i
wouldn't
agree
that
the
matter-in-controversy
is
the
lesser
requirement.
i
mean,
indeed,
in
the
class
action
situation,
because
of
ben
hur,
that's
the
only
rule
that
keeps
out
additional
plaintiffs.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
in...
in
the
class
action
context...
and
again,
my
case
is
not
a
class
action...
i
frankly
can't
explain
how
you
reconcile
ben
hur
and
zahn.
i
think
those...
the
cases...
for
the
same...
if...
if
the
rationale
of
ben
hur
is
that
the
class
members
are
not
really
parties
in
the
full
sense
and
so
we
don't
need
to
worry
about
their
citizenship,
i
would
think
you
could
make
the
same
type
of
argument
as
to
matter-in-controversy
that
as
long
as
the
representatives
satisfy
it,
they're
the
parties
in
the
full
or
true
sense
and
so
that's
all
that
counts.
but
the
court
decided
zahn.
there
was
really
no
doubt
about
that.
congress
never
indicated
that
it
had
any...
any
difficulties
with
that
decision,
and
it's
now
well
established.
and
i
think...
the
final
point
i'd
just
make
very
briefly
is
that
if
you
were
to
interpret
1367
to
have
this
broad
effect
of
opening
up
diversity
actions
to
unlimited
joinder
of
plaintiffs,
nondiverse
plaintiffs,
plaintiffs
with...
who
don't
have
the
requisite
amount
in
controversy,
it...
it
really
would
be
absurd,
not
in
the
sense
that
doing
that
on
its
own
is
absurd.
i
don't
contend
that.
but
it...
it
is
not...
it
would
not
be
rational
for
congress
to
go
to
all
this
trouble
that
it
went
to
in
subsection
(b)
to
rule
out
all
these
sort
of
indirect
situations
where
the
plaintiffs
leave
out
a
party
in
the
initial
complaint
and
then
wait
for
the
party
to
come
in
some
other
way...
i
mean,
things
that
frankly
are
not
likely
to
happen
in
a
lot
of
cases...
but
then
say,
oh,
but
the...
the
doors
are...
are
wide
open
under
rule
20,
bring
in
as
many
plaintiffs
as
you
want
right
at
the
outset
or
later
on
if
you'd
prefer,
don't
worry
about
diversity,
don't
worry
about
the
amount
in
controversy.
those
two
things
just...
just
don't
go
together.
there
are...
there
are
other
things
about
subsection
(b)
that
don't
make
good
sense
under
the
petitioner's
view.
i
mean,
for
example,
this
is
just
one
of
them.
if
you
just
look
at
the
language
of
subsection
(b),
it
says
you
shall
not
have
supplemental
jurisdiction
under
subsection
(a)
over
claims
by
plaintiffs
against
persons
made
parties
under...
a
list
of
rules...
and
then
one
of
them
is
rule
20.
well,
whenever
you
have
more
than
one
defendant
in
a
case
just
named
in
the
complaint,
you
use
rule
20
get
in
more
than
one
defendant.
so
read
literally,
that
says
if
you
had
this
broad
view,
plaintiffs
can
bring
in
as
many
additional
plaintiffs
as
they
like
under
rule
20.
but
on
the
defendant's
side,
as
soon
as
you've
got
a
second
defendant
in
the
case,
suddenly
all
this
supplemental
jurisdiction
goes
away.
now,
that
makes
sense
under
our
view
because
plaintiffs
are
not
supposed
to
be
asserting
these
kinds
of
claims
anyway.
whether
there's
one
defendant
or
two,
it's
the
rationale
of
owen
equipment.
thank
you.
