well,
if
it's
under
the
language
of
section
1367,
i
think
it
makes
more
sense
to
say
the
court
has
original
jurisdiction
over
the
action,
but
lacks
original
jurisdiction
over
the
defective
claims.
i
mean,
that
meets
what
1367
seems
to
say
on
its
face.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
hope
you
will
address
the
fact
that
congress
very
recently
has
enacted
legislation
that
makes
all
this
in
the
future
at
least
non-objectionable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
and
it's
not
retroactive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
unless
1367
effectively
overturned
zahn.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
enacted
later.
