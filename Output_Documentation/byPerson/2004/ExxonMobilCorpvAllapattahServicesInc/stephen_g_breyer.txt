justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
not...
the
weakness
in
your
point,
i
think,
as
i...
as
i
understand
it,
which
is
a
very
optimistic
assumption,
given
the
complexity
here--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is...
is
that
you
want
to
read
(a)
as
if
it
applies
to
arising-under
jurisdiction
and
not
to
diversity
jurisdiction.
very
simple.
arising-under
jurisdiction,
you
do
maintain
jurisdiction
over
the
original
action.
you
can
add
a
claim,
but
as
long
as
there's
one
good
claim
arising
under,
there's
original
jurisdiction.
diversity,
there
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
add
that
plaintiff,
you
don't
get
the
original...
that's
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so,
in...
in
other
words,
in
that
situation,
it's
a
third
party
claim
by
the
defendant
against
another
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
then...
that
does
fall
within
(a).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
(b)
knocks
it
out
insofar
as
the
plaintiff
wants
to
assert
a
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
person
can
assert
a
claim
against
a
plaintiff.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that,
you
say,
is
the
answer
to
what
i
was
going
to
ask--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
is
why
didn't
they
just
use
the
word
1331.
and
the
reason
they
didn't
just
use
the
word
1331
is
there
is
a
subset
of
diversity
claims
that
also
have
to
fall
within
(a).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
other
thing,
of
course,
is
if
these
three
professors
who
wrote
this
had...
had
figured
this
out
so
well,
why
in
heaven's
name
didn't
they
at
least
write
an
article
about
it
so
we'd
know
what
we
were
doing?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is
the...
can
you...
this
is
something
i
should
know,
but
i
don't
know.
all
right.
it's
very
elementary.
if
you
have
two
parties
from
different
states,
diversity
claim,
they're
in
court
perfectly
properly.
now,
if
somebody
intervenes
under,
say...
say,
rule
24
or
suppose
it's
rule
19,
a
necessary
party,
and
that
destroys
the
diversity,
does
the...
does
the
federal
court
still
have
jurisdiction?
it
does,
i
gather,
under
rule
14
if
the
defendant
impleads
or
brings
his
own
lawsuit--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--against
a
third
party.
what...
what
happens
under...
that
doesn't
destroy
it,
rule
14.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that.
what
about
19
and
24?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
you
mean
by
allowed
that
plaintiff
is...
one...
he's
from
the
same
state
and
destroys
the
diversity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
can
do
it,
though.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
about
under
rule
19?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
rule
20
you
could
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
rule
24
you
could.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
difficulty,
i
guess,
is
that
i'm
having
is
let's
imagine
rule
19
or
24.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you're
saying
that
is
an
instance
where,
if
you
bring
the
party
in
and
he
destroys
diversity,
you're
out.
that
was
true
before
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there...
before
this
statute,
there
never
is
going
to
be
a
circumstance
in
which
you
bring
in
a
person
under
rule
19
and
diversity
is
destroyed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now...
now,
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
mixes
me
up
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then...
then
what's
confuse...
now,
we
look
at
1367(b)
and
it
says
the
district
court
shall
not
have
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
a
claim
by
the
plaintiff
against
a
rule
19
person
who
is
brought
on
the
defense
side.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
the
inconsistent...
i.e.,
it
would
be
nondiverse,
but
you
said
there
couldn't
be
such
a
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
michigan
plaintiff
against
iowa
defendant,
necessary
party,
michigan
defendant,
rule
19.
now
we
bring
him
in.
and
you're
saying
before
this
statute,
not
going
to
come
in
because
it
will
wreck
jurisdiction.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
then
i'm
going
to
stop
asking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
it's
very
easy
to
me
to
reach
the
outer
limit
of
my
understanding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
have
before
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
they
could
at
least
come
in
if
the
defendant--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--under
rule
14
joined
another
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
person
x
wanted
to
join--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
part
of
the
action--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
could
be
a
19,
20,
or
24.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
imagine
that
if
you
filed
a
claim
and
the
plaintiff
was
a
class
and
the
class
contained
a
number
of
people
who
did
not
meet
the
jurisdictional
minimum
and
they
file
a
claim
against
a
defendant
in
a
diversity
suit,
i
imagine
the
first
thing
the
judge
would
say
would
be,
i've
read
zahn
and
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
over
this
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that
was
prior
to
the
statute.
so...
so
they
say,
well,
that's
what
the
judge
would
have
said,
and
moreover,
if
you
had
not
a
class
action
and
you
had
three
plaintiffs
and
one
of
them
was
from
a
different
state
than
the
defendant
and
the
other
two
were
not,
the
first
thing
the
judge
would
say
is,
i'm
very
sorry.
there
is
not
complete
diversity.
i
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
this
action.
and
so
i
take
it
their
point
is
by
coincidence
or
not,
that's
what
this
statute
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
since
that's
what
the
statute
says,
that's
what
it
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
means
that
this
kind
of
a
situation
does
not
fall
within
1367(a)
because
there
was
not
jurisdiction
over
that
action.
so
i
agree
with
you
that
those
words
are
what
their
claim
depends
upon,
but
what
is
the
answer
to
that
contention?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
finley
happened
to
be
an
arising-under
case,
and
in
an
arising-under
case,
as
long
as
there
is
one
claim
that
arises
under,
there
is
jurisdiction
over
the
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
if
you
agree...
and
i'm...
when
i'm
saying
these
things
in
such
a
definite
tone
of
voice,
they
reflect
deep
insecurity
because
i--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
but
i...
i
want
to
know
what
is
the
answer
to
that
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
don't
see...
where
i'm
starting
from
this...
because
at
some
point
i'd
like
you
to
get
to
the...
the
virtue
of
their
position
in
my
mind
at
the
moment
is,
one,
it
is
consistent
with
the
language,
which
says
civil
action,
not
claim.
two,
it
is
consistent
with
the
only
instruction
i
read
that
any
legislator
gave
to
the
people
who
were
writing
this,
staff,
namely,
write
something
that's
noncontroversial.
and
third,
i
can,
on
their
interpretation
at
least,
i
believe
at
least
late
at
night,
make
sense
out
of
all
the
words
in
these
three
different
sections.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
at
some
point,
i
would
appreciate
your
addressing
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they...
they
didn't
make
a
recommendation
one
way
or
another
on
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
he
did
this
thing...
when
he
was
trying
to
write
this
statute,
he
seemed
fixated
on
one
thing,
kroger,
and...
and
(b)
seems
to
reflect
an
effort
to
make...
put
in
statutory
form
kroger.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
they
do
say
in
no
event
should
the
enclosed
materials
be
construed
as
having
been
adopted
by
the
committee.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait.
on
your
last
statement,
i...
you...
something
that
i
hadn't
focused
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
just...
you
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
i
thought
it's
the
defendants
who
want
to
be
in
federal
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
can't
remove
the
action
unless
it
could
have
been
there
in
the
first
place.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore,
this
interpretation,
if
you're
overruling
zahn,
would
have
made
a
big
difference
because
it
would
have
meant
the
defendants
could
have
brought
a
lot
of
cases
into
federal
court
by
the
removal,
and
you
would
have
seen
the
plaintiffs
bar
up
in
arms
if,
in
fact,
this
provision
would
have
allowed
for
easier
removal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they're
saying
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
if
it
does
in
the
amount,
it
does
so
in
the...
if
it's...
if...
you're
trying
to
drive
a
wedge
between
the
geographical
diversity
and
amount.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
say
you
can't
do
that
under
the
statute.
if
you're
prepared
to
say
that
bringing
in
a
new
plaintiff
from
the
same
state
as
the
defendant
does
destroy
diversity
over
the
original
action,
you
must
also
be
prepared
to
say
that
bringing
in
a
new
plaintiff
who
only
has
$3
at
issue
destroys
the
original
jurisdiction
because
there's
no
way,
in
terms
of
the
original
jurisdiction
and
the
wording
of
1332,
to
make
that
distinction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
respond
to
that
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly,
but
that's
the
reason
for
saying
that...
look,
as
i
understand
it...
and
this
is...
the...
the
thing
that
got
me
thinking
they
may
have
a
point
here
is
a,
b,
and
c
are
dealing
with
three
separate
problems.
the
first
problem
is
how
to
overrule
finley
without
affecting
anything
else
like
zahn
or
any
of
the
others.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
second
problem
b
is
simply
kroger.
b
is
how
to
make
statutory
kroger.
and
c
is
united
mine
workers
v.
pennington
to
make
sure
they
have
discretion
to
get
rid
of
supplemental
jurisdiction.
now,
once
you
see
it
as
three
separate
problems...
i
know
they
wanted
me
to
see
it
this
way,
but
once
you
see
it
as
three
separate
problems,
the
words
fall
into
place
as
long
as
you
do
interpret
that
word,
civil
action,
to
mean,
well,
there
is
no
jurisdiction
over
the
civil
action
where
what's
happened
is
you've
simply
added
as
a
defendant
a
nondiverse
party
or
you've
added
as
a
plaintiff
a
nondiverse
party
or
a
party
that
doesn't
meet
the
jurisdictional
amount.
now,
i
spell
all
that
out
because
i
hope
in
the
next
15
minutes
you
will
tell
me
why
that's
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
that...
that's
what
i
thought
was
their
view
of...
of
(b).
to
go
to
(b),
you
understand
(b),
you
have
to
go
back
before
kroger.
and
kroger
was
worried
about
some
clever
plaintiff,
as
you
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--getting
a
defendant.
he
knows
this
defendant
is
going
to
bring
a
third
party
complaint
against
smith
from
the
same
state,
and
he
says,
ha,
i'll
sue
this
defendant.
and
analogous
things
happen
with
rule
19
and
24,
not
really
with
20
they
said,
but
19
and
24.
and
then
kroger
says,
hey,
you
can't
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
(b)
was
judge
weis'
effort
to
make
sure
that
was
codified.
it
wasn't
really
meant
so
much
as
some
kind
of
exception
from
(a).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was
meant
to
have
an
independent
basis
there.
so
i
didn't
see,
if
you
give
it
an
independent
basis,
how
anything
odd
happens--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--by
giving
it
their
reading.
