justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips,
before
you
proceed
to
going
on
to
(b),
the...
you
have
set
up
a
dichotomy
between
a
federal
question
case
where,
as
long
as
you
have
a
federal
question
claim
in
the
case,
you
qualify
within
those
words,
of
which
the
district
courts
have
original
jurisdiction.
but
you
say
that
in
a
diversity
case,
that's
not
so
if
you
have
people
not
of
the
same
citizenship...
of
the
same
citizenship
on
both
sides
of
the
party
line,
so
that
you
have
to
have
a
totally
qualifying
action
on
the
diversity
side
to
come
within...
to...
to
be
within
1367(a).
but
we
have
had
at
least
two
cases
where
the
starting
lineup
did
not
satisfy
the
complete
diversity
rule.
one
was
caterpillar
and
the
other
was
newman-green,
and
the
court
said,
yes,
on
the
day
one
there
wasn't
complete
diversity,
but
that's
curable
later
on,
in
the
one
case
before
the
case
was
tried,
in
the
other
in
the
court
of
appeals.
so
don't
at
least
those
two
cases
suggest
that
you
can
have
a
diversity
case
legitimately
in
the
federal
court
even
though
at
the
outset
you
don't
have...
fill
all
the
requirements?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
court
said
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
the
court
didn't
say
they
were
ignoring
it.
i
thought
they
said
it
was
curable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
didn't
start
over
in
caterpillar.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
caterpillar
didn't
start
over
and
newman-green
wasn't
detected
till
appeal,
but
the
appeals
court
didn't
say
start
over.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't...
i
don't
follow
that
entirely,
mr.
phillips,
because
the...
exxon
lost
at...
at
this
trial,
and
preclusion
doctrines...
that
means
that
exxon
had
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
defend.
so
exxon
is
going
to
be
bound
by
that...
by
the
determination.
somebody
who
was
not
in
the
litigation
and
might
say,
well,
i
want
more,
say,
somebody
who
had
opted
out--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
you're
saying,
mr.
phillips,
i
think
is
that
1367
does
nothing
with
regard
to
what
was
in
the
old
days
at
least
1367(a),
what
was
called
ancillary
jurisdiction.
it
changed
pendent
jurisdiction
to
overrule
the
finley
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so...
so
you
could
have
appendant
parties,
but
what
was
once
known
as
ancillary
jurisdiction,
applicable
in
diversity
cases,
was
not
changed
at
all
by
1367(a).
i
think
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
whether
you...
whether
you
call
it
codify
or
anything
else,
there
would
be
no
change.
1367,
as
you
read
it,
made
no
change.
1367(a)
on
the
federal
question
side
certainly
did.
it
overruled
finley.
before,
you
could
have
pendent
party
jurisdiction.
now
you
can.
but
kroger
was
unchanged.
i
think
what
you're...
you're
telling
us
is
that
except
for
some
difference
in
(b),
1367(a)
leaves
ancillary
jurisdiction
as
it
found
it.
it
doesn't
make
any
change.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what...
what
is
the
language
in
1367(a)
that
effects
any...
any
change
in
diversity
jurisdiction,
what
was
once
called
ancillary
jurisdiction?
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
change.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
may...
you
may
say
that
there's
a
confirmation
of
what
was,
but
there's
no
change.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that's
what
kroger
was
about.
it
said,
yes,
that
you
could
do
it...
that
the
plaintiff
then
couldn't
turn
around
and
sue
the
third
party
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
you
did
not
need
diversity
between
the
defendant
and
the
third
party
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
statute,
as
far
as
class
actions
go,
changed
nothing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
party
joinder,
which
is
your
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
class
action
fairness
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
all.
you
couldn't
have
a...
if
i
remember
right,
a
permissive
counterclaim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
defendant--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
have
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
we
descend
from
the
level
of
parsing
the...
the
statute
to
what's
going
on
in
these
cases,
in
your
cases
i
take
it
there
was
an
injury
to
a
child.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
qualifies
under
the
amount-in-controversy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
her
mother
or
sister
and,
i
think,
father
wanted
to
come
in
and...
and
bring
claims
that
were
entirely
derivative
of
the
injured
child's
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
on
your
reading
of
1367,
there's
the...
the...
there's
no
accommodation
for
that.
so
you'd
either
have
to
have
the
whole
lawsuit
in
the
courts
of
puerto
rico
or
you'd
have...
let
the
child
sue
in
the
federal
court
and
the
parents
would
have
to
bring
a
separate
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
a
legislature
might
think,
well,
now
this
finley
has...
we've
been...
taken
care
of
that.
and
your
case
looks
very
much
the
same
in
terms
of
breaking
up
a
lawsuit
into
two
when
it
makes
sense
to
try
it
all
together.
so
we
think
that...
that
old
case
should
go
just
the
way
finley
went.
and
the
same
thing
with
zahn
because,
after
all,
zahn
doesn't
fit
very
well
with
ben
hur.
if
you're
saying
that
the
strawbridge
rule...
i
mean,
what
really
counts
is
diversity,
and...
and
ben
hur
says
the
only
named
representative
citizenship
counts
and
yet
the
amount-in-controversy,
the
lesser
thing
in
your
view...
every
single
member
of
the
class
has
to
meet
that
amount,
but
only
the
named
representatives
have
to
be
of
diverse
citizenship.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you...
does
it
make
sense
to
have
a
rule
that
says
we're
going
to
ignore
the
citizenship
of
the
members
of
the
class
for
diversity
purposes,
for
diversity
of
citizenship?
only
the
named
representative
counts.
well,
then
why
shouldn't
only
the
named
representative
count
for
amount-in-controversy?
that
would
have
been
a
rational
thing
for
congress
if
they
wanted
to
fix
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
talking
about
a
claim
mover?
i'm
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
stearns,
there's
a
difference.
it's
not
just
style.
there's
a
difference
between
a
claim
and
a
civil
action.
a
civil
action
can
bundle
several
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
they...
what...
the
argument
that
i
heard
was
not
that
all
the
claims
have
to
be
aggregated,
but
that
they
can't
get
in
the
door.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
federal...
the
federal
study
committee
was
divided
on
zahn
issues.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
the
whole
committee
said
we
do
not
want
to
take
a
position
on
zahn.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
was
the
chair
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
stearns,
one
of
the
things
that
we
do
know
was
that
congress
intended
to
make
a
modest
change.
they
had
their
eye
on
finley.
they
wanted
to
overrule
that.
and
if
there's
an
ambiguity,
isn't
a
court
well
advised
to
make
the
least
change?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if...
if
you
have
a
statute
with
a
clear
meaning,
i
agree
with
you,
but
this
statute
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
a
muddle.
and
if
you
could
read
it
in
two
different
ways,
then
why
don't
you
say,
well,
i'll
pick...
if
they're
both
plausible,
i'll
pick
the
one
that
doesn't
introduce
any
radical
change,
that
just
makes
a
minor
change?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it...
it
does...
to
the
extent
that
strawbridge
is
involved,
it...
it
is
a
big--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as...
as
indeed
they
were
in
the
class
action
fairness--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
haven't
overruled
snyder.
they
said
in
this
class
action
context
if
you
meet
the
standards
that
they
set,
you
can
aggregate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
don't
understand
the
distinction
that
you're
making
between
diversity
of
citizenship
and
amount
in
controversy
since
1332
includes
both.
to
qualify
for
diversity
from
the
very
beginning,
you
have
to
be
of
the
opposite...
you
have
to
be
from
a
different
state
than
your
opponent
and
the
matter
in
controversy
must
be
x.
and
that's
always
been
part
of
the
diversity...
diversity
jurisdiction.
there
were
two
components.
one
was
the
citizenship
of
the
parties.
two
was
the
amount
in
controversy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr....
mr.
ayer,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
your
interpretation?
i
think
you
were...
your
position
is
that
clark
against
paul
gray
has
been
overruled,
and
whatever
one
may
say
about
the
attention
that
was
focused
on
zahn,
clark
against
paul
gray
has
been
on
the
books
since
1939.
and
it
seems
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
overruled
that
without
even
making
a
peep
to
that
effect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
it's
about
an
amount-in-controversy
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
didn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that...
this
point
was
not...
would
be
you're
asking
us
to
decide
it
in
the
first
instance.
you,
i
would
expect,
make
argument
to
the
district
judge
when
you
go
back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
because
the
court
conceived
of
there...
there
being
one
entity,
so
you
couldn't...
you
couldn't
change...
split
that
one
entity
into
two
fictitious
persons.
