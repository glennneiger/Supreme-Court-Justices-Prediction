in
other
words,
you'd
have
the
same
issue
of
preclusion
problems
if
you
had
done
the
case
from
the
beginning
the
way
you
contend
it
ought
to
have
been
done.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
mean,
justice
ginsburg's
point
is
you...
you...
even
with
a...
a
few
properly
named
defendants,
you're
going
to
have
the
same
issue
preclusion
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
you
say
the
civil
action
has
to
give...
be
diverse
as
to
all
claims.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
over
every
claim...
every
claim
in
the
class.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
in...
in
city
of
chicago,
we
did
not
give
that
meaning
to
the
term
civil
action.
now,
then
you
would
say,
well,
city
of
chicago
is
a
federal
question
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
i
would
say
then
you're
asking
us
to
interpret
civil
action
differently
in
two
statutes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
they
also
use
the
term,
civil
action,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
interpretation
of
the
two
differs
if...
if
the
city
of
chicago--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is...
is
correct.
justice
anthony

strawbridge
has
become
less
hallowed
in
light
of
the
new
congressional
enactment.
what's
it
called?
the
sunshine
in
class
action?
what
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
understand
in
2005
congress
doesn't
necessarily
express
what
was
before,
but
it...
it
seems
to
me
there's
an
institutional
judgment
that
strawbridge
is
not
that
hallowed
a...
a
principle.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
the
opinion
for
two
consolidated
cases
exxon
mobile
corp
versus
allapattah
04-70
and
ortega
versus
star-kist
foods
04-79.
one
of
the
most
important
statutory
grants
of
federal
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
courts
is
28
u.s.c.
ยง1332(a).
it
grants
federal
district
courts
original
jurisdiction
over
diversity
cases
in
which
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendants
are
citizens
of
different
states
and
the
section
further
provides
that
district
courts
have
original
jurisdiction
over
diversity
claims
only
if
the
amount
in
controversy
exceeds
a
specified
amount.
congress
from
time
to
time
historically
has
changed
the
jurisdictional
amount,
under
current
law
and
under
the
laws
that
have
applied
to
these
cases,
it
is
$75,000.00.
in
an
earlier
case
from
this
court
called
zahn
versus
international
paper
company,
we
held
that
all
plaintiffs
must
independently
satisfy
this
amount
in
controversy
requirement.
zahn
was
a
class
action
in
which
the
named
plaintiffs
satisfied
the
amount
in
controversy
but
this
was
not
true
for
all
the
other
class
members.
in
zahn
the
court
did
not
allow
the
class
action
to
proceed.
it
held
that
plaintiffs
who
do
not
adequately
allege
a
sufficient
amount
in
controversy
must
be
dismissed
from
the
action
even
if
other
plaintiffs
do
meet
the
requirement.
in
1990,
congress
enacted
28
u.s.c.
section
1367
the
so-called
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute.
section
1367(a)
provides
that
in
any
civil
action
in
which
the
district
courts
have
original
jurisdictions,
the
district
court
shall
have
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
all
other
claims
that
are
part
of
the
same
article
iii
case
of
controversy.
the
question
presented
in
these
consolidated
cases
today
is
whether
sectoin
1367
in
effect
overrules
zahn
and
allows
federal
district
courts
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
of
plaintiff
that
do
not
meet
the
amount
in
controversy
requirement,
as
long
as
at
least
one
plaintiff
in
the
action
advances
a
claim
that
does
satisfy
this
and
all
other
requirements
of
original
jurisdiction.
the
question
is
divided
the
courts
of
appeals.
we
granted
certiorari
in
two
cases,
one
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
and
one
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
in
order
to
resolve
the
conflict.
the
resolution
of
the
issue
turns
on
whether
a
diversity
case
in
which
the
claims
of
some
but
not
all
plaintiffs
satisfy
the
amount
in
controversy
presents
a
civil
action
at
which
the
district
courts
have
original
jurisdiction
within
the
meaning
of
the
recently
enacted
section
1367(a).
we
hold
the
answer
is
yes.
section
1367(a)
does
confer
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
other
claims
that
do
not
independently
satisfy
the
amount
in
controversy
requirement.
when
a
complaint
includes
several
claims,
some
of
which
satisfy
the
original
jurisdiction
requirements,
the
district
court
has
original
jurisdiction
over
that
subset
of
claims,
when
we
cannot
accept
the
view
that
the
presence
of
one
claim
in
the
action
that
fails
to
satisfy
the
amount
in
controversy
requirement
destroys
original
jurisdiction
over
all
those
other
claims.
while
it
may
be
true
that
the
absence
of
complete
diversity
destroys
original
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
all
claims,
this
contamination
effect
arises
because
of
the
special
nature
in
justification
for
the
complete
diversity
rule.
unlike
the
complete
diversity
requirement
the
amount
in
controversy
requirement
can
be
analyzed
claim
by
claim.
because
we
conclude
that
section
1367(a)
unambiguously
confers
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
claims
that
do
not
independently
satisfy
the
amount
in
controversy
requirement,
we
need
not
turn
to
other
interpretative
tools
such
as
legislative
history.
even
if
we
did
resort
to
legislative
history
in
this
case
moreover,
we
find
that
section
1367's
legislative
history
is
an
unreliable
guide
in
this
case.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
is
affirmed.
the
judgment
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
