mr.
ayer,
let...
maybe
i'm
going
to
oversimplify
to
the
point
of
the
absurd
but
let
me
try
it.
the
argument
that
you're
answering
is
the
argument
that
there
is
no
textual
basis
in
(a)
to
distinguish
the
geographical
diversity
requirement
from
the
amount-in-controversy
requirement.
your
answer
is,
i
think,
that
when
the
drafters
in
(a)
refer
to
action
and
jurisdiction,
those
terms
have
to
be
understood
historically
as
we
have
understood
them,
and
the
significance
of
a...
a
geographical
problem,
which
does
destroy
jurisdiction
traditionally,
is
different
from
an
amount-in-controversy
problem
which
is...
which
does
not
and
is
dealt
with
more
simply.
is
that
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
