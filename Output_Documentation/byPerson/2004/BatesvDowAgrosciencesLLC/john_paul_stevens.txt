we'll
hear
argument
in
bates
against
dow
agrosciences.
mr.
frederick.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
waxman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr....
mr.
waxman,
you
said
they
didn't
file
a
motion
to
dismiss.
i
thought
you
brought
the
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
they
couldn't
file--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
didn't
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
your
own
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you're...
you're
arguing
the
merits
of
the
tort
claims
rather
than
the
preemption
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
did
allege
a
defective
design
claim
under
texas
law,
would
that
have
been
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is
not
whether
there's
preemption.
it's
whether
there's
a
state
cause
of...
state
law
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
waxman--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
ask
you
one
question
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
goes
to
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--excuse
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
let
me
ask
this
one
question.
supposing
the
label
says,
this
product
contains
vitamin
a.
period.
and
it
doesn't
contain
vitamin
a,
and
they
prove
that
in
court.
and
you
say
you
would
have
to
change
the
label.
i
suggest
you
could
change
the
product
by
putting
vitamin
a
in
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
that
an
answer
to
the
misbranding?
you
change
the
product
not
necessarily
the
label.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
a
false
statement
in
the
label.
the
label
happened
to
be
false,
a
misrepresentation
in
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
the
manufacturer
knew
it
didn't
contain
it.
he
falsely
put
that
in
the
statement--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and...
and
it's...
it's
a
misbranded,
false
statement.
now,
does
he
have
to
change
the
label
or
could
he
change
the
product?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
suggesting
he
could
sell
the
product
with
the
same
label
if
he
just
changed
the
product
to
correct
the
misstatement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
blatt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
remedy
to
that
would
not
necessarily
be
to
change
the
label.
it
might
be
to
change
the
quality
of
the
product
that
requires
how
much
time
for
mixing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
say
about
my
vitamin
a
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
do
you
endorse
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
just
mere
inducement
to
change
a
label
is
sufficient
to
create
preemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
you
have
about
4
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
federal
insecticide
fungicide
and
rodenticide
act
which
i
shall
call
fifra
requires
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
register
a
pesticide
before
it
may
be
sold
in
the
united
states.
section
136v(b)
of
fifra
is
a
preemption
provision
that
prohibits
states
from
enforcing
any
requirements
for
labeling
or
packaging
in
addition
to
or
different
from
those
required
by
fifra
or
the
epa
regulations
promulgated
under
the
statute.
this
case
concerns
a
scope
of
that
provision.
petitioners
are
29
texas
peanut
farmers
who
applied
a
weed
killer
called
strongarm
through
their
crops
during
the
2000
growing
season.
respondent
dow
the
manufacturer
of
strongarm
had
registered
with
the
epa
earlier
that
year.
according
to
the
petitioners'
allegations
strongarms
severely
damage
their
peanut
crops.
while
srongarm's
label
recommended
its
use
"in
all
areas
where
peanuts
are
grown".
petitioners'
claim
that
dow
knew
or
should
have
known
that
srongarm
would
stunt
the
growth
of
their
peanuts
where
grown
on
soils
with
a
ph
level
of
7.0
or
greater.
when
petitioners
notified
dow
in
their
intent
to
sue,
dow
filed
on
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
federal
district
court
alleging
that
petitioners'
state
law
claim
are
expressly
preempted
by
136v(b).
in
response
petitioners
filed
counterclaims
alleging
various
causes
of
actions
grounded
in
texas
law.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
dow
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
holding
that
petitioners'
claims
were
preempted
by
section
136
because
success
on
those
claims
would
induce
dow
to
alter
its
srongarms
label.
this
holding
was
incorrect
because
136v(b)
speaks
only
of
requirements.
the
proper
inquiry
calls
were
analysis
of
the
requirements
imposed
by
the
state
law
of
rule
and
issue.
not
for
speculation
as
to
whether
a
jury
verdict
may
prompt
a
manufacturer
to
change
its
label.
a
state
law
requirement
is
preempted
by
section
136v(b)
only
if
it
satisfies
two
conditions.
it
must
be
a
requirement
for
labeling
or
packaging
and
it
must
be
in
addition
to
or
different
from
fifra's
labeling
requirements.
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
some
of
the
common
law
rules
upon
which
petitioners
rely
do
not
satisfy
the
first
condition.
rules
that
require
manufacturers
to
design
reasonably
safe
products
to
use
do
care
in
conducting
appropriate
testing
of
their
products
to
market
products
free
of
manufacturing
defects
and
to
honor
their
express
warranties
or
other
contractual
commitments
plainly
do
not
qualify
as
requirements
for
labeling
or
packaging.
none
of
these
common
law
rules
require
that
manufacturers
label
or
package
their
products
in
any
particular
way.
for
this
reason
petitioners'
claims
for
defective
design,
defective
manufacture,
negligent
testing
and
breach
of
express
warranty
are
not
preempted.
unlike
those
claims
petitioners'
fraud
and
negligence
failure
to
warrant
claims
are
based
on
common
law
rules
that
qualifies
as
requirements
for
labeling
because
those
common
law
rules
sets
standards
for
a
product's
labeling
that
dow
is
alleged
to
have
violated
by
falsely
claiming
that
strongarm
could
be
used
on
all
soils.
the
enforcement
of
those
state
law
standards
is
not
however
preempted
unless
they
are
in
addition
to
or
different
from
a
federal
standard.
thus,
section
136v(b)
does
not
preempt
state
law
rules
that
are
equivalent
to
and
fully
consistent
with
fifra
standards.
petitioners
argue
that
their
fraud
and
failure
to
warn
claims
rely
on
state
rules
that
are
parallel
to
fifra's
misbranding
positions.
like
the
state
law
rules
the
federal
misbranding
provisions
prohibits
false
and
misleading
statements
on
pesticide
labels
and
require
that
labels
contain
adequate
instructions
and
warnings.
petitioners
may
well
be
correct
in
contending
that
the
relevant
texas
law
does
not
impose
any
requirements
that
are
different
from
or
in
addition
to
the
federal
requirements
but
we
do
not
decide
that
issue
because
it
involves
the
matters
of
texas
law
in
which
we
have
not
received
adequate
briefing.
we
therefore
leave
that
question
open
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
on
remand.
accordingly
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
