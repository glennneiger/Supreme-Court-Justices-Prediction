justice
antonin
scalia
at
any
cost?
i
mean,
what
if
it...
you
know,
yes,
i
can...
i
can
sell
you
stuff
that
will...
that
will
work
in
high
ph
soil,
but
it's
going
to
be
three
times
as
effective.
do
i
have
to
sell
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
i
just
sell
it
for
those
people
who
don't
need
it
for...
for
high
ph
soil
at
a
third
the
price
with
a
warning
that
says,
hey,
by
the
way,
don't
use
this
in
high
ph
soil?
it's
crazy
to
say
you
can't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
their
burden?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
their
burden
or
is
your
burden
to
show--
justice
antonin
scalia
--requirements
for
labeling
or
packaging--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
are
in
addition
to
or
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
requirements
for
labeling
or
packaging.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
new
position
for
the
government,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
used
to
take
the
opposite
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we're
dealing
here,
as...
nobody
has
mentioned
it,
but
there...
there's
a
clear
statement
rule
for
preemption,
isn't
there?
doesn't
the
preemption
of...
of
traditional
state
powers
have
to
be
clear
in
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's...
it's
ambiguous
enough
that
the
government...
the...
the
chief
beneficiary
of
the...
of
the
supposed
preemption
didn't
see
it.
it
used
to
come
out
the
other
way.
how
can
you
possibly
say
it's
clear?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
it's...
it's
welcome
to
change
it,
but
it...
it's
one
thing
to
change
it.
it's
another
thing
to
change
it
and
come
in
to
say
that
the
question
is
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
congress
wanted
that,
surely
it
could
have
stated
it
more
clearly
than
simply
saying
the
state
shall
not
impose
or
continue
in
effect
any
requirements
for
labeling
or
packaging.
a
tort
suit
because
of...
of
mislabeling
is
not
a
requirement
for
labeling
or
packaging.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
congress
wanted
to
say
that,
they
could
have
said
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have...
you
have
that
provision
which
talks
about
requirements
for
labeling
or
packaging
in
conjunction
with
another
provision
that
authorizes
the
state
to
regulate
the
sale
or
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you...
you
have
to
make
sense
of
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
seems
to
me
that
means
the
state
can
impose
certain
requirements
upon
the
seller
to
the
consumer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
every
change...
virtually
every
change...
virtually
everyone...
if...
if
you
believe
the
respondent's
theory,
virtually
any
state
regulation
of
the
substance
of
the
sale
will
require
a
change
in
the
label.
justice
antonin
scalia
sale...
sale
or
use
is
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
say...
if
they
regulate
the
sale
or
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
give
me
sale
examples.
