justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the
problem
i
have
with...
with
the
government's
case
and
with
the
respondent's
case
is
that...
it's
really
the
obverse
of
what
justice
ginsburg
said.
their
problem
is
that
they
would
recast
everything
as
a
warning.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
restatement
have
some
specific
provisions
that
say
no
matter
how
good
the
warning
is,
you're
still
entitled
to
proceed
when
there's
a...
i
don't
know...
dangerous
product
or
defective
product
or
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even...
even
if
the
warning
specifically
covered
that
design
defect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
even
if
this
product
said,
warning:
may
not
be
effective
in
high
ph
soils,
that's
not
good
enough?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
never
a
question
of
the
reasonableness
or
the
adequacy
of
the
warning?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
on...
on
that
aspect
of
the
case,
you
put
in
your
pleadings
that
this
was
a
violation
of
fifra.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
a...
that's
a
bit
different.
you
were...
you
were
asserting
a
moment
ago
i
thought...
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
this
was
a
violation
of
fifra
because
it
was
misbranded.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you
then
have
a
suit
under
fifra,
but
i
don't
think
that
was
the
theory
of
your
complaint.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
you
take
the
position
that
juries
can
do
what
a
state
regulation
cannot
do,
or
are
they
much...
are
they
on
a
par?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
disagree
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
can
they--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--can
they
do
the
same
thing
by...
through
jury
verdicts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
now...
so
now
you
say
a
state
can
do
something
by
regulation
that
a
jury
can't
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
if
the...
if
juries
can
do
anything
that
the...
are...
are
prohibited
under
your
view
from
doing
anything
that
the
state
could
do
by
a
state
regulation.
