g.

oh,
not
necessarily.
it
wouldn't
be
always
either
way.
i
would
think
that
if
in
fact
you
have
a
product
and
the
product
causes
harm
in
a
subset
of
cases,
which
you
could
warn
against,
then
a
jury
could
decide
whether
the
unreasonableness
consists
of
not
having
designed
the
super-safe
product
or
the
unreasonableness
consists
of
not
having
had
a
different
label.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
arguing
that
in
this
case
you
have
the
first.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
implausible
on...
you
know,--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
all
they'd
have
to
do
is
don't
use
it
in
ph
soil.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
view...
in
your...
your
opinion,
if
you
were
to
follow
that,
would
epa...
suppose
epa
does
the
following.
epa
looks
into
this
and
they
publish
a
reg
that
says
in
this
case
or
in
this
subset
of
cases,
or
some
kind
of
description
that
fits
yours,
we
think
that
the
labeling
should
be
thus
and
so
and
we
think
that
state
tort
suits
will
interfere
with
our
ability
to
promote
the
uniform
labeling
and
therefore
they're
preempted.
can
the
epa
do
that
on
your
theory?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
their
strong
point.
so
what
is
the
response
to
that?
because
you
can
easily
get
two
juries
in
different
parts
of
the
country
to
decide
absolutely
opposite
things
as
to
what
the
label
should
say,
and
in
those
circumstances,
they
say,
well,
they're
in
an
impossible
situation
and
that's
why
congress
passed
the
statute,
to
be
sure
it
would
be
epa
and
not
two
juries
in
different
places.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
speaking
practically.
and
i
don't
have
to
go
into
all
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know
the
argument.
it's
a
very
familiar
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
ask
one
because
i
think
you'll
hear
some
variation
of
this,
and
you
have
a
minute,
which
is
the...
the
statute
sets
up
a
perfectly
good
way
of
keeping
this
branded
stuff
off
the
market.
all
any
complaining
farmer
has
to
do
is
to
go
to
epa
and
ask
them
to
pull
it,
and
pulling
it
is
an
unbelievable
sanction.
it's
like
the
atomic
bomb
on
the
company.
and
so
that's
very
strong.
and
the
only
thing
that
leaves
out
is
the
possibility
of
damage
remedies,
but
if
you
want
your
damage
remedy,
just
go
to
epa
and
tell
them
to
give
it
to
you
because
they
can
write
the
rule
the
other
way
that
i
was
suggesting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
would
just
say
it
doesn't
preempt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
quite
clearly
have
both.
i
understand
that.
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
the...
the
preemption
point
because
what
i
think
they're
saying
is
go
read
the
red
brief,
your
brief,
pages
6
and
7,
and
there
you
see
a
statutory
requirement
and
you
see
regulatory
requirements,
regulation.
and
i
think
one
of
their
claims
is
we
are
arguing
that
that
statutory
requirement,
without
any
change
in
the
regulatory,
that...
that
it
was
violated.
these
are
false.
they're
misbranded.
so
we
are
not
imposing
a
requirement
different
from
or
in
addition
to
the
requirement
of
federal
law.
we
are
enforcing
a
requirement
that
is
the
same
as
the
requirement
of
federal
law,
and
if,
by
the
way,
the
epa
were
to
think
that
tort
suits
in
those
circumstances
in
practice
are
too
disuniform,
let
them
promulgate
a
regulation
to
that
effect.
but
they
haven't.
now,
what...
what
is
the
answer
to
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
you
were
just
going
to
point
out
where
it
says
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
i
think
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so...
so
if
you
have
one
administration
thinking
the
one
thing
and
the
other
thinking
the
other
thing,
why
isn't
the
answer
that
the
agency
can
promulgate
the
reg
it
wants?
and
therefore
if
the
reg...
if
the
agency
comes
to
that
conclusion,
let
them
promulgate
that
reg.
and
if
a
different
one
thinks
it
can
work
with
the
tort
suits,
let
them
promulgate
that
reg.
