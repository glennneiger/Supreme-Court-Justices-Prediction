mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
pesticides
are
economic
poisons
designed
to
kill
living
things.
sometimes
they
do
not
work
as
designed.
for
more
than
a
century
until
the
1990's,
courts
routinely
permitted
farmers
to
bring
claims
against
pesticide
manufacturers
for
crop
damage
caused
by
pesticides.
in
enacting
amendments
to
fifra
in
1972,
congress
did
not
intend
to
displace
those
preexisting
state
law
remedies.
the
farmers
here
allege
claims
for
defective
design,
defective
manufacturing,
fraud,
breach
of
warranty,
and
failure
to
warn
for
a
brand
new
product
that
severely
damaged
their
peanut
crops.
i'd
like
to
start
with
our
narrowest
theories
for
reversal
and
demonstrate
for
three
reasons
why
those
claims
survive
preemption.
the
defective
design
and
manufacturing
claims
challenge
the
product's
composition,
not
its
label.
the
fraud,
warranty,
and
negligence
claims
involve
general
legal
duties,
not
pesticide-specific
requirements,
and
the
failure
to
warn
and
fraud
claims
are
not
different
from
or
in
addition
to
fifra
requirements.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
dow
concedes
at
pages
43
and
49
of
its
brief
that
defective
design
and
manufacturing
claims
generally
are
not
preempted.
that
concession
warrants
a
remand
here,
as
this
case
was
decided
before
discovery,
enable
the
farmers
to
develop
their
claims.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
ginsburg,
the
way
the
restatement
of
torts
and
product
liability
in
sections
1
and
2
describe,
there
are
basically
three
theories
that
products
liability
claims
can
proceed
on:
a
defective
design,
defective
manufacturing,
and
defective
warnings.
the
restatement
explains
that
they
are
distinct
legal
theories
that
go
to
different
problems
that
the
manufacturer
has
caused
with
respect
to
the
product.
a
defective
design
claim
asserts
that
the
composition
was
inadequate
and
that
a
properly
designed
product
could
have
been
put
on
the
market
that
would
not
cause
the
harm.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
certainly,
but
here--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well
here,
your
honor,
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
dow
filed
was
not
based
on
the
merits
of
the
claims.
it
was
based
on
them
being
preempted,
displaced
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
they
also
asserted
a
limitation
of...
of
remedy
provision.
but
we
never
had
discovery
in
this
case.
the
district
court,
after
finding
jurisdiction,
considered
dow's
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
preemption
and
locked
us
out
of
the
courthouse
door
before
we
ever
had
a
chance
to
prove
that
a
safer
design
for
the
product
could
have
been
made.
and
that's
where
we
think
the
court's
decision
below
was
overbroad
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
restatement
sections
1
and
2
address
this,
and
what
the
restatement
says
is
that
if
you
can
show
that
the
product
could
have
been
reformulated
to
be
properly
designed,
then
the
existence
of
a
warning
that
might
go
to
certain
of
its
uses
would
not
negate
a
defective
design
claim.
the
texas
supreme
court--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that...
that's...
that's
correct.
and
what
the
restatement--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--under
the
restatement
rule,
which
texas
has
adopted
in
the
uniroyal
case,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief
i
think
at
page
47,
that
is
true
because
the
restatement
explains
that
there
are
certain
warnings
that
could
be
ignored
or
not
observed
or
not
understood
properly
and
that
if
it
can
be
proved
that
a
properly
designed
product
would
be
on
the
market,
there
are
public
policy
reasons
why
that's
what
we
want
to
encourage
manufacturers
to
do.
i
mean,
under--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
to
answer
your
question
in
several
ways,
that's
a
jury
determination
to...
to
ascertain
the
reasonableness
of
the
alternate
design
that
the
manufacturer
would
be
asked
to...
to
do
or
to
market
a
separate
product
that
was
separately
designed
for
high-acid
soils.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
warnings
in
this
sense,
justice
kennedy.
if
you
take
their
theory,
which
is
that
a
defective
design
claim
always
collapses
to
a
failure
to
warn,
they
can
put
out
a
defectively
designed
product
that
admittedly
causes
harm,
and
all
they
have
to
do
is
change
the
label
and
say,
if
used
in
these
particular
circumstances,
it
may
cause
harm,
because
that
would
necessitate
a
change
to
the
label--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
that...
there
are...
that's
why
the
restatement
makes
clear
that
there
are
distinctive
theories
for
defect--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
we
have
both
actually.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
we
have
defective
warning
too,
and...
and
if
i
can
address
that
as
well.
the
statute
here
prohibits
in
section
136q(1)
any
false
or
misleading
statement
in
the
label
as
to
any
particular.
our
position
is
that
the
2000
label
said,
suitable
for
peanut-growing
areas
in
all
places
where
peanuts
are
grown.
that
was
false.
under
the
statute,
that
is
a
misbranding,
and
that
is
actionable
as...
both
as
a
failure
to
warn,
as
a
fraud
claim,
and
as
a
breach
of
warranty.
now,
the
medtronic
majority
made
absolutely
clear
that
that
kind
of
claim
is
not
preempted,
and
in
fact
all
nine
justices
agreed
that
when
the
state
law
claim
is
parallel
to
the
federal
requirements,
the
existence
of
a
state
law
remedy
is
not
an
additional
requirement.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
don't
necessarily
need
to
say
a
violation
of
fifra
is...
so
long
as
the
requirement
is
the
same,
although
we
can
certainly--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
the
theory
of
our
complaint
was
a
failure
to
warn
both
for
negligence
and
as
a
defective
product.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
and
because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
and...
and
because
of
the
preliminary
of
this
suit,
justice
kennedy,
we
certainly
should
have
the
opportunity
to
amend
our
complaint.
there
are
counterclaims
that
this
is
done
at
the
motion
for
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
it
can
and
the...
the
interesting
aspect
of
this,
justice
breyer,
is
that
of
course
epa
hasn't
done
that.
epa
has
made
very
clear
it
never
tested
for
efficacy.
it
never
even
gave
notice
and
comment
so
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
have
to
do
it
pursuant
to
their
powers
under
136v(a)
which
is
the
regulation
of
sale
or
use
or
under
136v(c)
which
says
that
when
a
state
designates
a
particular
locality
requirement
and
a
special
need,
it
can
impose
a
label...
it
can
impose
requirements
that
the
manufacturer
has
to
comply
with.
now,
the
epa
importantly...
and
this
is
in
their
regulations
at
163.152...
has
specifically
said
that
states
have
labeling
authority.
the
states
can
impose
labeling
requirements.
now,
there's
no
reason
why--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
justice...
no,
justice
o'connor,
except
to
the
extent
that
if
the
state
can
affirmatively
do
it
through
a
positive
regulation,
their
theory
has
to
be
wrong
that
the...
that
any
incidental
effect
that
induces
a
change
to
label
is
preempted.
that
theory
has
to
be
wrong,
and
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
relied
on.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
but
i
want
to
address--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--as
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--a
warranty
claim,
justice
o'connor,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
the
cipollone
case,
is
not
a
requirement
under
state
law
because
it's
a
voluntary
contractual
arrangement
between
the
parties.
the
court
i
think
has
made
clear
that
what
has
to
be
ascertained
here
is
does
the
state
cause
of
action
or
the
state
law
create
a
requirement.
that's
not
true
in
the
warranty
case
because
fifra
doesn't
speak
to
requirements
in...
as
to
warranties.
it
speaks
to
requirements
in
other
ways.
so
what
dow
did
here
with
its
warranty
was
completely
voluntary,
and
the
fact
that
it
breached
that
warranty
by
putting
on
the
market
a
product
that
was
not
suitable
for
the
use
in
all
areas
where
peanuts
are
grown
is
a
breach
of
a
warranty
that
it
voluntarily
undertook.
breach
of
that
is
not
a
requirement
imposed
under
state
law.
and
that
has
been,
i
think,
verified
by
seven
justices
of
this
court
in
the...
in
the
cipollone
case.
now,
if
i
could
speak
to
the
fraud
claim,
it
is
important
to
understand
that
in
both
cipollone
and
in
a
footnote
in
medtronic,
the
court
made
clear
that
where
there
are
general
legal
duties
that
are
not
observed
by
the
manufacturer
that
don't
go
to
the
specific
product
itself,
those
claims
are
not
preempted.
here
our
assertion
is
that
dow
put
on
the
market
a...
a
product
that
was
mislabeled
and
that
they
went
out
and
told
people
fraudulently
was
suitable
for
their
uses.
we
acted
in
reliance
on
that
and
we
suffered
damages.
those
are
general
legal
duties,
not
pesticide-specific
ones.
and
the
existence
of
the
preemption
clause
of
136v(b)
does
not
displace
us
from
the
opportunity
to
try
to
prove
to
a
court
that
fraud
was
committed
here.
now,
if
i
could
briefly
address
two
points.
one
is
that
the
inducement
to
change
theory
should
be
rejected.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
the
fifth
circuit
decided
this
case
and
it
is
an
overly
broad
theory
for
several
reasons.
first,
it's
not
supported
by
the
text
of
136v(b)
which
says
requirements
for
labeling.
it
doesn't
say
requirements
that
induce
a
change
to
the
label.
and
that's
how
many
of
the
courts
have
gone
off
track
since
the
cipollone
decision
was
announced
by
this
court.
they
have
read
fifra
as
saying
just
because
the
word
requirements
is
136v(b),
thereby
any
state
law
claim
that
imposes
a
requirement
that
might
induce
a
manufacturer
to
change
the
label
is
thereby
preempted.
we
think
that's
overly
broad
because
it
confers
way
too
much
discretion
on
manufacturers
to
decide
what
to
put
on
labels,
and
they
can
claim
immunity
for
any
overly
broad
claim
of
efficacy
so
long
as
when
they
are
sued,
they
can
say
we're
induced
to
change
the
label.
because
epa
does
not
evaluate
the
specific
contents
with
respect
to
efficacy
or
the
claims
that
are
made
on...
on
a
label,
if
a
manufacturer
makes
an
overly
ambitious
statement
as
to
efficacy,
all
the
manufacturer
has
to
do
under
the
inducement
to
change
theory
is
go
to
court
and
say
we
would
have
to
change
the
label
and
thereby
136v(b)
preempts
it.
now,
i'd
also
like
to
stress
that
the
other
side's
theory
creates
a
huge
regulatory
gap.
as
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
noted,
the
epa
does
not
evaluate
efficacy
on
the
front
end.
and
in
fact,
the
history
behind
these
provisions
is
that
epa
understood
from
the
very
beginning
that
common
law
claims
would
serve
an
important
incidental
regulatory
effect.
if
we
could
review
the
history
for
a
moment.
prior
to
the
1972
changes
to
fifra,
for
decades
farmers
had
brought
claims
against
manufacturers
for
design
defect,
for
failure
to
warn,
for
the
kinds
of
common
law
claims
that
we
have
asserted
in
this
case.
it
was
so
well
established
by
1972
that
there
was
a
huge
section
in
the
american
law
reports
that
annotated
all
the
cases
and
explained
what
the
common
law
duties
of
pesticide
manufacturers
were.
yet,
notwithstanding
that,
when
congress
enacted
the
1972
act,
despite
thousands
of
pages
of
hearings,
committee
reports,
legislative
debates,
there
is
not
one
mention
of
any
effort
to
displace
those
preexisting
common
law
claims.
and
when
epa,
in
discharging
its
responsibilities
under
the
1972
act,
got
overwhelmed
by
the
requirement
that
it
re-register
products
that
were
already
out
on
the
market,
pursuant
to
the
1972
act's
standards,
it
very
promptly
went
to
congress
and
said,
you
should
waive
efficacy
requirements
because
we
simply
can't
do
this.
congress
responded,
but
importantly
in
the
administrations
on
both
sides,
epa
has
always
understood
except
until
just
a
couple
of
years
ago
when
the
solicitor
general
changed
the
position
of
the
government,
that
these
kinds
of
incidental
common
law
suits
would
have
an
important
regulatory
effect.
if
we
could
just
take
the
case
of
ddt.
for
30
years,
manufacturers
were
sued
for
ddt
and
awarded
damages
until
it
became
clear
that
the
groundswell
over
the
course
of
decades
that
ddt
needed
to
be
banned,
and
it
was
only
at
the
back
end
that
the
expert
agency
regulators
determined
that
in
fact
the
product
needed
to
be
banned,
but
that
was
only
after
a
very
long
history
in
which
common
law
suits
had
provided
remedies
to
farmers
and
others
who
were
harmed
by
that
product.
now,
in
1982,
the
reagan
administration's
epa
expanded
the
efficacy
waiver
and
it
included
far
greater
products
than
had
been
done
in
the
carter
administration
in
1979.
and
in
the
federal
register
notice
announcing
that
it
was
intending
to
expand
that
efficacy
waiver,
the
epa
in
1982
said
the
reason
why
we
think
this
can
be
done
is
because
suits
can
be
brought
against
manufacturers
who
put
on
the
market
ineffective
products.
we
cited
that
on
page
31
of
our
brief.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
our
broadest
theory,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
word
requirements
in
136v(b)
doesn't
include
common
law
claims
at
all.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
you
disagree
with
that,
then
they
would
have
to
be
the
same,
and
that's
why
our
point
about
the
existence
of
the
parallel
requirements
is
the
same.
i
want
to
address
the
point
of
the
discordance
between
what
state
juries
can
decide
and
what
state
regulators
can
decide
because
dow
and
the
government
have
featured
that
in
their
case.
the
government
in
the
medtronic
case
at
page
27
of
its
amicus
brief
there
said
there
was
no
problem
to
be
had
with
juries
rendering
supposedly
inconsistent
decisions
so
long
as
they
were
following
one
federal
standard.
the
federal
standard
here
is
clear:
falsity.
tell
the
truth.
that's
what
manufacturers
are
obliged
to
do
under
the
statute
and
under
the
regulations.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
first,
the
juries...
unlike
a...
a
declaratory
judgment
or
an
injunctive
type
remedy,
justice
breyer,
a
jury
for
a
common
law
damages
claim
is
not
saying
what
affirmatively
should
be
on
the
labels.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
sure.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
sure.
the
answer
is
that...
that
congress
was
prepared
to
accept
a
certain
level
of
disuniformity
when
it
enacted
136v
because
it
made
very
clear
in
sandwiching
the
preemption
provision
of
136b...
surround...
by
(a)
and
(c)
that
it
was
prepared
to
allow
states
to
depart
in
significant
respects
from
what
was
nationally
uniform.
and
the
way
it
did
so
was
to
say
states
can
regulate
sale
or
use
and
they
can
also
impose
extra
requirements
for
special
locations.
now,
what
dow
did
here
i
think
illustrates
the
way
the
system
is
supposed
to
work,
which
is
that
when
a
problem
was
identified
with
their
product
in
the
states
of
texas,
oklahoma,
and
new
mexico,
within
7
months
it
petitioned
the
epa
to
append
to
its
national
uniform
label
a
supplemental
label.
and
that
supplemental
label
says
it
is
for
distribution
in
those
three
states
only
and
it
provided
10
important
changes
to
the
label
that
it
otherwise
had
as
a
nationally
uniform
label.
that's
how
the
system
is
supposed
to
work.
if
the
incidental
regulatory
effect
of
jury
verdicts
or
common
law
claims
induces
or
causes
some
kind
of
change
to
the
label,
that
can
be
done
without
an
adverse
effect
to
national
uniformity
through
the
supplemental
labeling
process.
and
what
dow
did
here
was
it
has
its
label
and
then
it
attaches
the
supplemental
label
that
addresses
the
particular
conditions
that
exist
in
the
state.
and
the
epa
has
recognized
that
as
a
perfectly
appropriate
and
valid
way
to
address
the
geographic,
environmental,
and
climatic
conditions
that
exist
in
the
different
regions
of
the
country
that
engage
in
agriculture.
there's
nothing
that
is
uncertain
about
that
if
you
accept
the
premise
of
the
government's
argument
in
medtronic,
which
is
that
juries
can
be
properly
instructed,
if
it
came
to
that,
so
that
they
could
follow
the
appropriate
federal
standard.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn...
sorry.
did
you...
no,
go
ahead.
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the...
the
requirements
aspect
of
the
case
because
we
do
think
that,
under
our
broadest
theory,
this
is
a
different
situation
than
medtronic
and
cipollone,
and
because
of
the
important
statutory
indications
that
are
in
the
provision
136v.
unlike
in
medtronic,
there
is
an
explicit
provision
that
is
a
non-preempted
provision,
and
that
is
different
from
medtronic.
where
in
medtronic
there
was
a
provision
that
allowed
the
fda
to
impose
its
own
decisions
as
to
requirements
and
whether
or
not
the
states
should
be
displaced,
here
congress
made
the
determination
in
136v(a)
and
in
(c)
that
those
kinds
of
requirements
can
be
imposed.
they're
in
addition
to
what
the
federal
standard
is.
that
means
that
you
have
to
look
at
requirements
in
a
somewhat
different
way
because
the
states
have
this
authority
that
they
did
not
have
under
the
medical
device
amendments.
there's
a
textual
indicator
under
(b)
also
which
refers
to
(a)
in
the
sense
that
(b)
says
such
state
that
shall
issue
these
requirements.
such...
the
meaning
of
it
in
webster's
means
what
has
been
already
described...
is
in
(a),
and
in
(a)
the
states
are
authorized
to
promulgate
regulations.
so
we
think
that
there
is
a
textual
basis
for
distinguishing
the
word
requirements
that
this
court...
five
justices
in
this
court
in
medtronic
said
would
encompass
common
law
claims.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i
don't
think
that
epa
could
write
a
rule
requiring
damages
to
be
done.
it
doesn't
have
the
statutory
authority--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
there's
no
indication
here
that
epa
can
do
that
kind
of
thing.
in
fifra,
it
certainly
doesn't
have
that
kind
of
provision.
i
mean,
certainly
there
are
different
ways
that
the
statute
could
have
been
written.
that
isn't
the
choice
that
congress
made.
thank
you.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
just
have
two
points
to
make.
with
respect
to
the
summary
judgment
posture
of
the
case,
the
way
this
unfolded
was
that
on
one
day
the
district
court
decided
the
motion
for
jurisdiction,
that
it
had
jurisdiction.
on
the
very
next
day,
dow
rushed
into
court
with
its
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
what
mr.
waxman
cites
as
the
celotex
invocation
merely
says
that
on...
on
this
point
it
is
neither
unfair
nor
premature
to
require
defendants
to
produce
evidence
in
support
of
their
claims
now
as
the
celotex
trilogy
requires.
i'm
reading
from
their
motion
for
summary
judgment.
that
was
filed
before
the
counterclaims.
the
only
thing
that
they
knew
about
was
the
deceptive
trade
practices
notice
letter
that
the
farmers
had
filed
pursuant
to
state
law.
so
they
didn't
know
what
our
claims
were,
and
they
were
requiring
or
saying
that
the
district
court
could
throw
us
out
of
court
without
giving
us
any
opportunity
to
file
counterclaims,
much
less
try
to
develop
evidence
that
would
prove
them.
now,
with
respect
to
the
disuniformity
point,
when
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1988
to
add
the
word
uniformity,
it
said
in
that
public
law
that
it
was
a
technical
amendment.
we
don't
know
why
congress
put
the
word
uniformity
in.
the
legislative
history
is
barren.
it
just
says
this
is
a
technical
amendment.
it
didn't
change
the
substantive
provisions
that
empowered
states
to
impose
regulations
that
would
have
the
effect
of
disuniformity.
now,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we've
got
claims
that
have
been
brought
historically
since
the
late
19th
century.
until
epa
had
a
sudden
change
of
heart,
there
were
decades
in
which
juries
made
these
decisions
with
respect
to
these
kinds
of
products,
and
those
preemption
decisions
really
didn't
take
hold
until
after
this
court
announced
cipollone
in
1992.
and
it
was
only
at
that
point
that
the
courts
began
to
have
preemption,
but
for
the
previous
2
decades,
juries
routinely
decided
these
kinds
of
cases.
the
sky
did
not
fall.
epa
didn't
come
in
and
say
there's
labeling
disuniformity
as
a
result
of
this.
there
simply
were
no
problems.
but
what
did
happen
was
that
the
farmers
who
used
products
were
able
to
get
compensation
when
pesticides
damaged
their
crops.
thank
you.
