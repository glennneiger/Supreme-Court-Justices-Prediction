mr.
frederick,
on
the
defective
design
claim,
presumably
that's
based
on
a
factual
theory
that
dow
could
have
reasonably
designed
strongarm
to
be
safe
for
growing
peanuts
in
high-acid
soil.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
doesn't
that
mean
your
client
should
have
to
put
forward
some
evidence
establishing
a
material
issue
of
disputed
fact
on
that
point?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
didn't
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
epa
has...
has
waived
efficacy
data
requirements.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
is
it
your
position
that
a
state
can
pass
a
law
requiring
labels
to
have
efficacy
claims?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you're
not
relying
on
that
in
this
cause
of
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does...
does
fifra
require
the
manufacturer
to
say
on
the
label
what
the
item
can
be
used
for?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
how...
how
does
an
express
warranty
claim
escape
preemption--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--where...
where
dow
just
says
the
federally
mandated
statement
is
included
on
my
label
and
it's
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
maybe
it
isn't
a
labeling
violation.
i
mean,
there
are
claims
made
here
that
i
have
trouble
shoehorning
into
your
theory.
for
instance,
why
does
a
claim
that
dow
negligently
failed
to
field
test
its
product
on
peanuts
on
acid
soil
impose
a
label
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i...
i
just
don't
understand
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
didn't
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
just
try
to
boil
it
down
a
little
bit
for
my
purposes.
do
you
concede
that
there
could
be
a
claim
based
on
no
testing--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
there
could
be
a
claim
based
on
design
defect,
that
there
could
be
a
claim
saying
there
were
off-label
oral
statements
made
that
amounted
to
fraud
or
misleading--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they
now
say
they
don't.
they
ought
to
be
able
to
proceed
on
those
claims.
what
do
we
do
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
also
the...
also
the
claims
of
false,
misleading
statements
outside
the
label.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's...
let's
be
specific
here.
if
it's
a
failure
to
test,
if
it's
a...
a
design
defect
requirement,
if
it's
an
off-labeled,
false
misrepresentation,
why
are
they
preempted?
