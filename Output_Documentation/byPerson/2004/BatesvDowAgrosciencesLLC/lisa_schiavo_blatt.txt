thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
would
entirely
destroy
the
uniformity
contemplated
by...
contemplated
by
the
statute
if
the
epa-approved
and
mandated
label
were
subject
to
jury-by-jury
invalidation
based
on
a
jury's
determination
of
whether
a
label
is
false.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes,
we
have--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
we...
we
think
subsection
(b)
is
unambiguous
in
preempting
any
statement.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
the
agency
is
allowed
to
change
its
position
and
we
realize--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
we
think
that...
we
realize
that
our
position
was
inconsistent
with
not
only
the
court's
decision
in
cipollone
and
in
medtronic
that
recognizes
that
requirement
extends
to
common
law
duties.
but
more
importantly,
a
system
where
a
jury
by
jury
on
the
same
facts
could
come
up
with
completely
different
reasons
why
a
label
is
false--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
unlike
medtronic
where
preemption
occurred
by
virtue
of
the
fda's
regulation,
under
fifra
there's
preemption
by
virtue
of
the
statute
itself.
and
i
just
want
to
give
one--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
that's
just
not
true,
with
all
due
respect.
i
mean,
they...
the...
we
don't
verify
the
accuracy
of
the
efficacy
labeling,
but
the
requirement,
both
in
the
preemption
provision
and
in
the
requirement
to
use
the
epa
label,
clearly
extends
to
efficacy.
and
you
can
have
disuniform
context
whether
it's
safety
or
efficacy.
imagine
a
label
that
directs
a
product
to
be
mixed
for
20
minutes.
one
jury
could
find
the
label
was
false
because
the
product
should
have
only
been
mixed
for
10
minutes.
another
jury
in
the
same
courthouse
could
find
the
label
was
false
because
the
product
should
have
been
mixed
for
at
least
30
minutes.
and
this
case
is
another
really
good
example.
now
the
petitioners
are
saying
the
label
says
that
the
soil
only
should
be
a
7.2
level.
their
expert
says--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--and
we
think
it's
critical
that
our
position
is
that
this
statute
only
operates
in
the
area
of
labeling,
and
it
preempts
only
those
state
labeling
requirements--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
your
vitamin
a
example
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
non-preempted
claim.
if
a
manufacturer
says
that
this
is
a
pesticide
and
he
puts
clorox
in
the
bottle,
the
plaintiff
wants
to
get
to
the
jury
on
the
theory
that
a
reasonable
manufacturer
would
not
have
used
clorox.
he
would
have
used
the
pesticide.
if
the
argument,
on
the
other
hand,
is
clorox
was
fine.
i
don't
have
a
problem
with
clorox,
i
just
wish
i
would
have
been
given
a
warning,
but
that's
not
the
way
a
plaintiff
would
frame
his
complaint.
we
think
it's
critical
that
our
theory
is
if
the
plaintiff's
theory
of
recovery
is
necessarily...
necessarily
predicated
on
a
requirement
that
the
manufacturer
used
a
label
different
than
the
epa-approved
label
the
federal
law
required
it
use--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
we
agree
that
they're
not
preempted.
our
only
position
is
by
the
time
it
got
to
summary
judgment,
the
courts
decided
that
they
had
no
evidence
on
what
would
have
been
non-preempted
claims.
if
another
farmer
wants
to
bring
an
expert
that
says
strongarm
can
be
manufactured--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
took
it
claim
by
claim
and
read
the
affidavit...
or
at
least
the
district
court
did--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--mere
inducement
only
to
the
extent
that
that's
a
shorthand
way
of
saying
the
label
was...
necessarily
had
to
be
required.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
if
the--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
i
think
they
did
say
if
a
common
law
duty
is
necessarily
premised
on
the
requirement
that
the
manufacturer
used
a
different
label
than
federal
law
required
him
to
use.
in
this
case,
the
common
law
duty
of
a
failure
to
warn
is
saying
the
manufacturer
should
have
put
something
on--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--the--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right,
and
that's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--not
on
labeling.
justice
scalia,
every
day--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
just
not
true.
every
day
states
and
localities
around
the
country
are
imposing
use
restrictions.
they
tell...
they
tell
applicators
and
users
when
and
where
to
apply
the
pesticide
and
what
types
of--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
right
and
they--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
right,
and
they
do
that
every
day
without
imposing
labeling
requirements.
imagine...
imagine--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--they
require
the
manufacturer,
in
order
to
sell
the
product,
be
registered
with
the
state,
and
they
can
impose
whatever
sale
restrictions
they
want--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that
don't
go
to
the
labeling.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
absolutely
not.
it
would
be
bad
enough
if
a
manufacturer
had
to
shop
his
label
around
50
states
and
had
each--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no.
a
state
absolutely
cannot
impose
labeling
restrictions
on
a
manufacturer.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
i'm
sorry.
under...
it...
the
alternative
theory
would
give
more
power
to
the
jury
to
impose
labeling
restrictions
than
the
state,
and
we
don't
think
the
state
can
do
it.
and
it
would
be
far
more
pernicious
if
a
label
were
subject
to
jury-by-jury
invalidation.
no
one
would
read
the
label,
much
less
understand
it.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
congress
just
wiped
out
labeling
and
only
those
labeling
requirements--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--justice
ginsburg,
it's
just
not
true.
the
lower
courts
well
understand
this
distinction,
and
they...
they
let
go
all
the
time
claims
as
not
preempted
that
are
true
manufacturing
defect
or
true
design
defect
claims.
this
is
not
a
complete
immunity.
this
is
a
narrowly
targeted
one
as
to
labeling.
there
is
a
famous
example
of
the
benlate--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it
can
be
brought
if
there's
state
law
and
evidence
to
support
the
state
law
that
doesn't
attack
the
labeling.
and
our--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--if
they
found
an
expert
that
said
if
you
had
manufactured
this
differently
or
if
you
had
designed
it
differently
and
there
was
evidence
to
support
that,
our
view
is
that
those
claims
aren't
preempted.
and
the
alternative
to
let
juries--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--this
case...
they
didn't
have
any
evidence
other
than
saying
that
the
label
was
inaccurate.
but
the
next...
another
jury
could
rely
on
the
respondent's
evidence
to
say
the
label
was
inaccurate
because
it
works
better
on
high
ph
soil,
and
another
jury
could
say,
well,
we
need
a
margin
of
safety
and
the
label
should
have
said
6.8
instead
of
7.0,
which
is
what
their
expert
says.
and
you
can
have
this
time
and
time
again
with
how
often
the
pesticide
has
to
be
applied,
when
it
has
to
be
applied.
and
to...
and
the...
the
whole
point
of
section
136v(b)
was
to
have
reliability--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
there's...
there's
been
preemption
at
least
since
the
late
'80's,
and
i
don't
know
of
cases
where
juries...
or
the
theory
for
recovery
was
invalidating
the
label.
there
are
lots
of
cases
that
are
true
manufacturing
defect
claims,
and
i
direct
your
attention
to
the
benlate
where
the
manufacturer
contaminated
his
product.
if
i'm
the
plaintiff,
my
theory...
the
theory
was
you
mismanufactured
this
product.
a
reasonable
manufacturer
would
have
taken
practices
to
prevent
contamination,
and
it
destroyed
a
lot
of
crops
and
epa
actually
took
enforcement
action
against
that
manufacturer.
the
rat
poison
example...
a
9-year-old
kid
died
of
rat
poisoning
because
it
tasted
like
a
candy
bar.
the
theory
of
recovery
was
all
the
manufacturer
had
to
do
was
put
a
bittering
agent
in
it
that
would
have
made
the
kid
throw
up
and
the
rats
still
would
have
loved
the
poisoning.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
label.
