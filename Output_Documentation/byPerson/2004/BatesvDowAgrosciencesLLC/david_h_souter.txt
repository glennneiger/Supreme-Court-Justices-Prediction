justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
reason
for
that,
i
take
it,
is
that
fifra
does
not...
i
mean,
i
think
you
agree
fifra
does
not
provide
an
independent
private
right
of
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you've
got
to
sue
under
state
law,
but
you
would...
you
would
kind
of
have
a
slam
dunk
for
your
position,
i
suppose,
if
your
pleading
said,
the
failure
to
warn
only
to
the
extent
that
in
fact
the...
the
warning
given
in
compliance
with
fifra
was
an
inadequate
warning.
that
would...
that
would
keep
you
within
the...
the...
in
effect,
the...
the
federal
limit,
and
it
would
also
make
clear
that
you
had
a
state
law
cause
of
action,
not
a
federal
cause
of
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
that's
in
effect
what
you're
arguing.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
doesn't
the
other
amendment
limit
your
argument?
because
congress
has
also
passed
an
amendment
to
the
effect
that
unless
epa
chooses
to
get
in
to
the
business
of...
of
passing
on
efficacy,
it...
it
need
not
do
so.
and
in
fact
we
know
it
is
not
doing
so.
why,
therefore,
doesn't
the
uniformity
argument
go
to
those
subjects
that
epa
does
review
for
and
why
doesn't
the
subject
of
efficacy,
in
effect,
drop
out
of...
of
the...
the
whole
preemption
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
can--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
on
your
theory
there
is
no
material
fact,
it
seems
to
me,
because
your...
you
say
they
cannot
make
good
on
that
claim
without
impeaching
the
label.
justice
david
h.
souter
every
time
they
sue
on
the...
on
the
ground
that...
let's
say,
that...
that
the...
the
actual
use
was
inconsistent
with
what
the
label
described,
you
could
say,
gee,
if
their
theory
is
correct,
we'd
have
to
change
our
label
to
say
that
what's
on
the
label
now
is
in
fact
not
properly
descriptive
of
the
product.
so
it's
not
a...
a
question
of
needing
more
fact.
on
your
theory,
whenever
they,
in
effect,
sue
on
the
basis
of
what
you
say,
your
response
is
going
to
be,
as
a
matter
of
law,
well,
if
they're
correct,
we'd
have
to
say
something
else.
that
impeaches
the
label.
therefore,
preemption.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
neither--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
problem
that
i
think
some
of...
several
of
us
are
having
is
that
both
the...
as
i
understand
it,
the
fifth
circuit
test
in
your
argument
draws
no
distinction
between
the
two
following
kinds
of
situations.
situation
a:
there's
something
that
the
manufacturer
should
have
told
you,
should
have
put
on
the
label,
but
the
manufacturer
didn't.
situation
b:
the
manufacturer
puts
something
on
the
label
which
in
fact
is
wrong
and
in
justice
stevens'
example
is
in
fact
false
and
it
causes
harm.
it
makes
sense,
it
seems
to
me,
for
preemption
purposes
to
say
if
the
person
who
sues
sues
simply
on
the
ground
that
i
bought
it
in
reliance
on
the
label,
the
label
was
false,
i
should
get
damages
for...
for
whatever
harm
was
caused,
that
situation
should
be
dealt
with
for
preemption
purposes
differently
from
the
situation
in
which
the...
the
manufacturer
made
no
false
statement.
he
simply
should
have
said
more.
and
if...
if
you
don't
distinguish
between
those
two
situations,
then
the...
the
prohibition
against
mislabeling
means
absolutely
nothing
because...
because
it
can
never
be
enforced,
in
effect,
except
with
respect
to
some
prospective
user.
it
can
never
be
enforced
with
respect
to
the
actual
user.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and
the
argument
that's
being
made
is
that
we
ought
to...
we
ought
to
read...
we
ought
to
read
the
limitation,
which
justice
scalia
has
just
described,
with
respect
to
labeling
and
packaging,
in
a
relatively
narrow
way
to
allow
the
suit
to
go
forward
and,
therefore,
we
ought
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
two
kinds
of
situations.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
why
isn't
there
a
big
difference,
for
purposes
of
your
argument,
between
the
medtronic
situation
and
this
one
for
the
simple
reason
in
this
case
you've
got
a
statute
that
authorizes
epa
to
do
absolutely
nothing
on
the
subject
of
efficacy?
and
epa
does
nothing
on
the
subject
of
efficacy.
