mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
fifra's
preemption
provision,
which
congress
specifically
amended
in
1978
to
add
the
title
uniformity,
preempts
by
its
terms,
quote,
requirements
for
labeling
different
from
those
required
under
fifra.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there
are...
there
are
two
fundamental
reasons.
the
first
is
that
it
is
a
principal
requirement
of
fifra,
and
has
been
since
1972
and
remains,
that
a
manufacturer
may
only
sell
a
registered
pesticide
with
the
precise
labeling
to
the
word
and
font
size
that
epa
has
approved,
and
that
requirement
applies
whether
the
wording
relates
to
human
safety,
environmental
protection,
or
efficacy.
now,
the
specific
amendment
in
1978
was,
as
mr.
frederick
indicated,
represented
a
representation
by
epa
to
congress...
and
congress'...
the...
the
committee
report
plainly
indicates
this...
that
the
epa
was
not
saying
we
are
no
longer
regulating
efficacy,
we
are
no
longer
concerned
with
efficacy.
what
they
said
was
because
the
department
of
agriculture
and
the
extension
services
and
the
state
universities
are
all
involved
in
this
and,
in
particular,
are
involved
in
the
statutory
requirement
that
before
a
manufacturer
can
even
apply
for
registration,
even
submit
a
registration
application,
the
manufacturer
must
do
extensive,
rigorous
efficacy
testing,
which
congress
has
indicated
correctly
is
very
expensive--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
the
manufacturer
makes
up
reports,
it
has
committed
a
felony.
epa
can
enforce
it.
it
can
refer
it
to
the
attorney
general.
it's
just
like
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
o'connor,
i
think...
i
will
address
the
negligent
testing
and,
of
course,
the
design
defect--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--discussion
that's
figured
so
prominently
in
my
colleague's
argument.
it's
very,
very
important
to
understand
that
unlike
in
sprietsma
and
medtronic
and
so
many
of
the...
and,
for
that
matter,
with
respect
to
the
preempted
claims
in
cipollone,
the
claims
that
were
preempted
below,
we
didn't
file
a
rule
12
motion
to
dismiss.
we
couldn't
have
with
respect
to
at
least
one
of
those
two
claims.
we
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
said
with
respect
to...
let
me
take
design
defect
first.
with
respect
to
design
defect,
it
is
possible
under
texas
state
law
to
state
a
claim
for
products
liability
under
defective
design
without
impeaching
the
labeling.
and
there
is
a
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
dean
powers,
the
university
of
texas
law
school,
for
the...
the
texas
chemistry
council
who's
an
expert
on
texas
tort
law,
and
he
goes
through
the
texas
torts
in
detail
to
show
why
they
are
all
preempted
and
all
invalid
under
independent
and
adequate
state
grounds.
but
what
we
did
is
we
didn't
move
to
dismiss.
we
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
in
that
motion
for
summary
judgment,
we
pointed
the
respondents
in
this
case
to
this
court's
decision
in
celotex
v.
catrett,
and
we
said,
in
effect,
we
know
that
you
can
allege
a
design
defect
claim
without
impeaching
the
labeling,
but
we
think
that
what
you
are
complaining
about
does
impeach
the
labeling.
therefore,
show
us
what
you
have.
now,
under
rule
56,
they
had
two
alternatives.
they
could
have
filed
an
affidavit
or
a
request
under
rule
56(f),
as
this
court
referenced
in
anderson
v.
liberty
lobby,
and
said,
hey,
we
don't
know
how
this
was
made.
we
don't
know
how
this
was
tested.
we
don't
know
how
this
was
manufactured.
we're
entitled
to
discovery,
and
district
courts
recognize
that
all
the
time.
what
they
did--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
did
not
do
that,
and
what
they
did
was
to
submit
affidavits
and
documentary
evidence,
including
expert
affidavits.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we
brought
the
lawsuit
and
we--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
no.
i
said
we
didn't
file
a
motion
to
dismiss--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no.
their
counterclaims.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
in
other
words,
this
wasn't
decided...
mr.
frederick's
reply
brief
talks
over
and
over
and
over
again
about
how
this
was
decided
on
the
pleadings,
and
you
know,
there
was
no
discovery
allowed.
under
rule
56,
they
could
have
asked
for
discovery
when
we
basically
said,
okay,
let's
show
our
hands.
we
got
two
jacks.
what
do
you
got?
and
what
their
expert
said
and
what
their
response
said
was
if
the
2001
amended
label
had
been
on
it,
we
wouldn't
have
been
injured.
now,
rule
56(c)
says
that
when
you
oppose
a
summary
judgment
motion
with
affidavit
evidence,
the
burden
is
on
the
adverse...
the
adverse
party
must
by
affidavits,
or
otherwise
provided
in
this
rule,
set
forth
specific
facts
showing
that
there
is
a
genuine
issue
for
trial,
and
they
didn't
do
that.
now,
the
classic
design
defect...
let
me...
let
me
give
you
an
example.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'll
take
them
in
your
precise
order.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
under
texas
law...
and
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
the
grinnell
opinion
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
says
this,
as
does
dean
powers.
under
texas
law,
negligent
testing
is
not
an
independent
tort.
it
is
of
necessity
a
subset
of
inadequate
warnings.
it
is
an
element
of
a...
the
tort...
the
claim
of
product
defect
related
to
warnings.
and
so
it
is
not
possible
under
texas
law,
settled
texas
law.
other
states
are
different,
but
texas
in
its
sovereign
capacity
has
chosen
to
make
claims
of
negligent
testing
an
element
of
the
tort
of
defective
product
by
failure
to
warn,
and
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
want...
as
the...
as
the
fifth
circuit
found
and
the
district
court
found,
we
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
in
texas
after
we
received
their
demand
letters
because
we
wanted
this
to
be
adjudicated
in
a
single
forum,
which
the
texas
venue
rules
would
not
have
allowed,
and
we...
we
actually
filed
this
in
lubbock,
texas,
which
is
the
geographic
center
of
where
these
29
farmers
operate.
now,
with
respect
to
defective
design,
yes,
under
texas
law
if
they
had
a...
they
have
to
allege
and
they
have
to
prove
that
there
is
a
safer
alternative
design
for
this
product,
which
they
never
even
introduced
one
quantum
of
evidence
about.
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
what
we
said
was
your
claims
are
preempted
if
they
impeach
the
labeling
that
we
are
required
by
federal
law
to
use.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
what
this...
what...
what
happens
under
rule
56--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
i'm
going
to
get
to
the
false
and
misleading
statements
outside
the
labeling
in
a
minute,
but
just
to
finish
the
design
defect
point,
they
filed
a
complaint...
a
counterclaim
which
had
as
a
count
this
was
defectively
designed.
it
is
possible
under
texas
law
to
prove
that
something
is
defectively
designed.
if
they
had
come
in
and
said,
but
we
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
says
here's
our
evidence
and
we
don't
think
that
you
can
satisfy...
that
you
are,
in
fact,
complaining
about
a
defective
design--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
if...
if
they
had
said,
look,
the
problem
with
this,
which
as
footnote
9
of
our
brief
indicates,
it's
not
a--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
no.
it's...
it's
both.
with
respect
to
defective
design,
what
we
said
is,
your
claim
is
preempted
because
you
aren't
going
to
go
to
the
jury
on
defective
design
without
impeaching
the
label.
if
we're
wrong,
prove
it
in
response
to
our
summary
judgment
submission.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
is...
it
is
absolutely
their
burden
in...
as
the
responding
party
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
to
show
that
there
are
material
facts
that
are
either
in
dispute
or
there
are
material
facts
that
would
allow
them
to
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
they--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
exactly
right.
what
they
could
have
done
in
response
to
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
to
say
this
product
assertedly
harms...
when
it
is
applied
before
the
seed
is
planted,
will
harm
the
product
it
is...
the
plant
that
it's
supposed
to
protect
if
the
soil
ph
is
too
high.
they
could
have
easily
have
come
back
and
said
if
they
had
a...
a
design
defect
claim
that
didn't
impeach
the
label
to
say
you
should
have...
there
was
a
way
to
manufacture
this
product.
you
could
have
it
in
pellet
form
rather
than
in
the
soluble
form
or
if
the
problem
was
the
alkalinity
of
the
soil,
there
is
a
way
to
design
this
so
that
it
is
dissolved
in
a
more
acidic
solution.
the
classic
case,
which
is
referenced
in
the
nrdc
brief,
which
has
many,
many
examples
of
true
design
defect
claims
that
don't
impeach
labels,
is
a
case
involving
rat
poison.
it's
a
case
called
banks
v.
ici
america.
it's
a
georgia
supreme
court--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
answer
is
threefold.
number
one,
a
challenge
to
a...
the
wording
of
a
statement
on
the
label
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
false
and
misleading
is...
does
impose
a
requirement
different
than
federal
law,
not
the
requirement
that...
that
labeling
not
be
false
and
misleading,
but
the
fundamental
requirement
that
a...
unless
and
until
the
epa
says
otherwise,
the
manufacturer
can
only
sell
this
product
with
the
precise
labeling
that
epa
has
approved.
and
it...
if
you
look
at
page
63a--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--of
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--insofar
as
labeling
is
concerned,
the
answer
is
yes,
and
that's
because
the
statute...
the
statute
has
many,
many
instances
in
which
it
makes
it
clear
that
in
service
of
the
objective
of
a
nationally
uniform
label,
the
expert
agency
that
approves
and
dictates
the
language
of
that
label
be
the
one
to
decide
what
is
or
isn't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
you
can...
you're--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--because
the
difference
between
a...
that
would
be
a...
a
manufacturing
defect,
which
are
cases
that
have
been
decided--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if...
if
the...
if
it
contains...
i'm
sorry.
was
it
vitamin
a?
if
it
contains
vitamin
a
because
that's
what
the
manufacturer
intended
and
that's
what
the
manufacturer
produced--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--oh,
i
see.
said
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
believe
that
you
have...
you
would
have
to...
i
mean,
would
it
be
efficacious
with
vitamin
a?
i
don't
know,
but
if
it...
if
it
requires
a
change
in
the
label,
it
has
to
be
done
by
epa
because
the
manufacturer
commits
a
federal
law
violation
if
it
sells
the
product
with
any
different
label.
if
you...
if
i
can
just
direct
the
court's
attention
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the
test,
as
the
fifth
circuit
stated,
justice
stevens,
is
whether
a
judgment
against
dow...
i'm
quoting.
quote:
whether
a
judgment
against
dow
would
cause
it
to
need
to
alter
the
strongarm
label.
i'm...
and
that's
the...
those
are...
that's
the
test
that
was
applied
here
and
is
always
applied.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is,
does
the
state
law
cause
of
action...
is
it
premised
on
a
state
law
duty
that
there...
that
different
labeling
be
used--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is,
a
little
bit
different
than
what
federal
law
requires.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
souter,
that
is
a
choice
that
congress
could
have
made.
it
is
plainly
not
a
choice
that
congress
did
make
because
it
applied
the
preemption
provision
to
requirements
that
are
either
in
addition
to
or
different
than.
and
whether
a
label
is
assertedly
misleading
because
it
fails
to
include
something
on
the
epa-approved
label
or--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
i...
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
and...
and
if
it...
if
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
allegation
in
this
suit...
the
claims
in
this
suit...
and
i...
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
