but
couldn't
you
make
every
failure
to
warn
claim
a
defective
design
claim?
that
is,
they
didn't
warn
about
the
effects,
but
those
effects
would
not
have
been
present
if
the
product
had
been
designed
to
assure
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
adverse
effect
on
the
peanut
crop.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
monitored
at
all.
the...
the
manufacturer
can
say...
make
up
reports
and
epa
is
never
going
to
look
at
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
way
you
proceeded
in
this
case,
you
made
it
clear
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
texas
court
itself
to
weigh
in
on
this
because
you
jumped
the
gun.
they
wanted
to
proceed
in
texas
court,
and
then
we
would
have
known
what
texas
law
was
on
these
subjects.
you
said,
no,
we
want
to
be
in
the
federal
forum.
justice

mr.
waxman,
do
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
waxman,
do
i
take
it
from
what
you
have
just
said
that
there
is
no...
even
though
the
statute
prohibits
misbranding,
that
there
is
no
way
that
that
can
be
privately
enforced,
that
misbranding
is
something
strictly
for
epa
to
deal
with,
that
the
statute
has
a
prohibition
on
misbranding?
i
can
see
the
argument
that
all
we're
doing
is
enforcing
the
provision
that
says
no
misbranding.
so
is
epa
the
only
the
player
in
the
misbranding
league--
justice

ms.
blatt,
there's
a
brief
in
this
case...
there's
a
brief
in
this
case
that
just
shows
hundreds,
if
not
thousands,
of
crop
damage
claims.
and
your
theory
is
that
with
this
ambiguous
provision
congress
wiped
all
that
out.
it's
hard
to
believe.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
everything
becomes...
but
every...
every
time...
my
crop
was
stunted.
okay.
you
have
to
change
the
label
so
you
can't
bring
that
suit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
says
their
claim
is...
is
very
simple.
you
didn't
tell
us
that
using
this
in
our
kind
of
soil
would
stunt
the
crop
and
wouldn't
kill
the
weeds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
saying
that
kind
of
claim
can't
be
brought
anymore.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i've
described
a
set
of
facts
which
your
position
i
think
you
have
to
say
affects
the
label.
the...
the
farmer
says
i
bought
this
bottle.
it
said
okay
for
all
peanuts.
my
crop
grew
and
it
was
stunted
and
the
weeds
stayed
alive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i'm
not
giving
you
that
case.
i'm
giving
you
exactly
what
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
happening
when
epa
took
the
opposite
view?
was
there
this
tremendous
disparity
with
juries
going
every
which
way--
