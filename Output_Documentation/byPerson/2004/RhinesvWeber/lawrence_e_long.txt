mr.
lawrence
e.
long
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress...
excuse
me.
congress
carefully
crafted
a
scheme
designed
to
encourage
state
prisoners
first
to
exhaust
all
of
their
state
post-conviction
remedies
and
then
to
file
their
habeas
corpus
petitions
as
soon
as
possible.
the
congressional
design
includes
three
mutually
dependent
statutes,
including
a
1-year
statute
of
limitations,
a
tolling
provision,
and
a
total
exhaustion
requirement,
the
combined
effect
of
which
is
supposed
to
reduce
delay,
serve
the
principles
of
comity,
finality,
and
federalism.
however,
stay
and
abeyance
erodes
each
side
of
this
triangular
statutory
design.
stay
and
abeyance
allows
tolling
in
federal
court
when
duncan
said
there
should
be
none.
it
extends
the
statute
of
limitations
beyond
1
year,
and
it
ignores
the
total
exhaustion
requirement
of
2254(b).
the
result
is
that
state
prisoners,
especially
capital
prisoners,
are
encouraged
to
file
mixed
petitions
and
rewarded
with
delay
if
they
do
so.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
i
think
that...
i
think
that
the...
the
answer
is
that
congress
designed
the
system
to
resolve
all
those
issues
in
state
court
first.
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
needs
to
be
kept
in
mind
is
that
an
unexhausted
claim
is,
by
its
very
nature
and
by
definition,
a
claim
where
there's
an
available
remedy
in
state
court.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
i
don't
think
the
system
needs
to
be
tinkered
with,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
my
response
is
in
two
parts.
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you
that
exhaustion
can
be
a
tricky
issue,
but
it's...
it's
the
most
tricky
in
the
question
about
whether
or
not
the
question
has
been
fairly
presented.
the
less
tricky
portion
of
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
claim
is
unexhausted,
having
been...
that
means
there's
an
available
remedy
in
state
court.
the
easy
way
to
sort
that
out
is
just
to
file
your
claim
in
state
court.
if
there
is
in
fact
an
available
remedy,
then
you
get
tolling,
and
that
solves
the
problem.
i--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--that's...
i...
i
suspect
that's
the
typical
case
in...
in
capital
cases.
mr.
rhines
is
currently--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--i
think
it's
less
complicated
than
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--i--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--i
disagree.
i
disagree
with
you,
justice
breyer.
i...
i
think
that
even
for
a
pro
se
petitioner,
i
do
not
think
it
is
more
difficult
for
him
to
find
the
door
of
the
state
courthouse
than
it
is
to
find
the
door
of
the
federal
courthouse.
and
the
key,
i
think,
to
your
argument
is
that
claims
are
unexhausted
by
definition
if
there's
an
available
state
court
remedy.
therefore,
by
definition,
they
ought
to
be
going
to
the
state
courthouse
rather
than
the
federal
courthouse.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
i...
i
can't--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
statute...
the
statutes...
the
three
read
together
and
enforced
together--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--well,
i
agree
with
that.
the...
let's...
let's
deal
with
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
please.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
that
was
not
the
situation
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
well,
the...
factually
the
court...
the
court
examined
the
amended
petition
and
concluded
that
eight
claims
in
the
amended
petition
were
unexhausted.
the
problem
is
this...
or...
or
at
least
the
variance
in
the
facts
from
what
you
suggest
is
this.
mr.
rhines
filed
an
amended
petition
in
november
of
2000
with
counsel,
after
having
been
through
all
the
record.
he
admitted
in
his
amended
petition
that
four
of
the
claims
were
unexhausted.
he
still
had
80
days
left
to
run
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
so
he
conceded
in
his
amended
petition
in
federal
court
that
he
still
had
80
days
to
run...
while
there
was
still
80
days
to
run
on
the
statute
of
limitation,
that
four
of
the
claims
he
submitted
in
the
petition
were
unexhausted.
that's
not
difficult
to
sort
out
because
defense
counsel
admitted
it,
as
he
pled
them.
and
so
there
isn't
any
tricky
question
about
whether
there
were
unexhausted
claims
in
this
petition.
now,
that
was
in
november
of
2000.
he
waited
until
the
court
decided
the
decision
in
july
of
2002
and
didn't
pursue
his
state
court
remedies
until
the
court
ordered
him
to
do
that
in
july
of
2002.
and
he
filed
his
state
habeas
to
exhaust
those
admittedly
unexhausted
claims.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
well,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
at
that
point,
your
honor.
if
there's
a
single,
solitary
unexhausted
claim,
the
problem--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--is
not...
is
not
worse
if
there
gets
to
be
12
or
15.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
well,
if
he...
if
he
goes
within
the
80
days
and
immediately
files
to
pursue
in
state
court
his
unexhausted
claims,
the
statute
is
tolled.
he
doesn't
lose
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
not
that
i've
found,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question,
your
honor,
is
that
in
order
to
follow
the
second
circuit
as
you've
described,
this
court
would
have
to
rewrite
the
interpretation
of
the
exhaustion
statute
that
they
issued
in
rose
v.
lundy.
that's
my
belief
because
rose
v.
lundy...
or
the
statute,
as
interpreted
by
rose
v.
lundy
indicates
that
at
a
minimum,
the
unexhausted
claims
ought
to
be
dismissed
without
prejudice
and
sent
back
for
exhaustion
in
state
court.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
your
honor,
if
the
petitioner
is
not
capable
of
going
back
to
litigate
the
state
claim,
the
claim
is
not
unexhausted
by
definition.
and--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--i
think
there
are
two
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the...
the
fact
of
whether
it
is
without
prejudice
in
fact
or
in
law
is
driven
by
how
much
time
is
left
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
a
dismissal
without
prejudice
at
the
time
the
amended
petition
was
filed
in
this
case
would
have
left
80
days
on
the
statute
and
he
could
have
pursued
his...
his
remedy
in
state
court
and
tolled
the
statute.
now,
in
the...
in
the
more
common
situation
with
the
habeas
petitioner,
i
think
the
answer
has
to
be
congress
has
changed
the
landscape.
they
have
changed
the
landscape
relying
upon
the
total
exhaustion
rule
in...
that
they
enacted
and
that
this
court
has
interpreted.
and
they
have
added
the
statute
of
limitations
and
they've
added
the
tolling
provisions,
and
that
has
to
be
entered
into
the
computation.
now,
i
think
that
that
simply
raises
the
bar
for
all
petitioners
to
make
doubly
sure
that
if
they
have
a
claim,
they
have
presented
it
to
a
state
court
judge
because
they...
they--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--your
honor,
i...
i
struggle
with
the...
one
of
the
premises
of
your
hypothetical,
and
the
portion
i
struggle
with
is
the...
is
the
situation
where
the
petitioner,
through
no
fault
of
his
own,
either...
and
i
think
that's
implied
in
your
hypothetical...
doesn't
go
to
state
court.
i...
i
think
that
that
is...
i
think
that
that's
the--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--the...
there's
the...
the
difficulty
in
the
stay
and
abeyance
procedure,
as
it
is
currently
practiced,
i
think,
is
that
there
is
no
set
of
standards,
other
than
the
three
statutes
that
we've...
that
we
have
discussed,
to
guide
the
district
court's
discretion
in
when
they
give
stay
and
abeyance.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
well,
i
think
the
predicate
to
getting
stay
and
abeyance,
your
honor,
is
that
there
has
to
be
at
least
the
presence
of
one
exhausted
claim
and
one
unexhausted--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--well,
i
think
that
that
follows
from...
i
think
that
follows
from
rose
v.
lundy
which
talked
about
a
mixed
petition
and
that's
the...
that's
the
factual
background.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
well,
i
think
the--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--it's
not
the
states
who
draw
a
distinction.
i'm
sorry.
the
federal
court--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--i
think
so,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
well,
that's...
that's
the...
it's
the
stay
that
we're
having
the
problem
with,
justice
stevens.
but...
but
if
there
is
the
presence
of
one
unexhausted
claim,
the...
the
total
exhaustion
requirement--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--he...
he
can
dismiss
the
unexhausted
one
and
move
forward.
and...
and,
of
course,
what
has
happened
in
the...
since
the...
the
landscape
has
changed
since
1982
and
because
now
the
1-year
statute
and
the
tolling
provisions,
there
is
more
sanction
for
that
dismissal
under
the
total
exhaustion
requirement
than
there
used
to
be.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
that's
a
hard
question,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--i...
i
think
this,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
the
court,
faced
with
a
mixed
petition,
ought
to
first
ask
why
have
you
not...
if...
if
there
is
truly
an
unexhausted
claim
in
this
petition,
why
did
you
not
present
that
claim
previously
in
state
court.
and
after
that,
if...
if
the...
if
the
answer
to
that
is
not
satisfactory,
i
think
that
the...
i
think
that
that
ought
to
be
tested
on,
for
example,
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard
or
the
actual
innocence
or
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
standards
which
this
court
has
announced
to
cure
procedural
defaults
in
extreme
cases.
but
in
the
absence
of
those
type
of
standards,
i
think
that
stay
and
abeyance
has
been
simply
applied
too
broadly
and
this
case
is
a
classic
example
of
the
misapplication
of
stay
and
abeyance.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
well,
i--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--well,
but--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--well,
the...
the
difficulty
with
the
way
it
is
now,
your
honor,
is
there
is
no
review
of
the
discretion
of
the
district
courts
at
all.
i
mean,
they
simply
do
it,
and--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--and
it's--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--well,
our
first
position,
obviously,
is
no
stay
and
abey
at
all,
that
the
unexhausted
claims
ought
to
be
dismissed,
as
the
eighth
circuit
said
in
this
case.
and
if
they...
if
they
are
truly
unexhausted,
then
there
is
going
to
be
a
remedy
in
state
court,
and
state
courts
are
perfectly
capable
of
identifying
constitutional
remedies
and...
and
meting
out
the
requirements.
i've
had...
i've
had
south
dakota
judges
send
murder
cases
back
to
me
to
try
after
12
years,
and
it's...
it's
a
burdensome
thing,
and
those
cases
need
to
move
forward.
but
what
i
would
envision,
justice
kennedy,
is
this,
that
the
rule
ought
to
be
that...
that
the...
the...
that
the
case
is
sent
back
to
state
court
if
there
is
truly,
as...
as
the
name
implies,
an
unexhausted
claim,
implying
that
there
is
an
available
state
remedy.
if...
if
resolution
in
the
state
courts
does
not
resolve
it,
if
the
case
comes
back
in
some
fashion,
then
the
court
needs
to
apply
some
standards
like
cause
and
prejudice
or
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice,
which...
which
is
what
is
applied
in...
in
procedural
default
cases,
and...
and
deal
with
it
on
that
basis.
but
the...
the
current
lack
of
discretion
with
reference
to
how
stay
and
abeyance
is
applied
is
in
my
judgment
the...
that
is
the...
that
is
the
most
fundamental
problem
with--
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
--stay
and
abeyances.
mr.
lawrence
e.
long
the...
well,
the...
the
second
circuit
followed
very
closely
to
what
the...
what
the
district
court
did
here,
your
honor,
but
what
i
did
not
see
in
the
second
circuit
opinions
and
frankly
haven't
seen
in
any
of
the
opinions
except
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
was
any
type
of
analysis
about
an
explanation
of
why
the
petitioner
hadn't
been
prudent
and
hadn't
been
diligent
in
state
court.
and...
and
in
the
absence
of
any
kind
of
inquiry
like
that,
i
think
that
stay
and
abeyance
simply
is...
is...
it's
unguided.
there
are
no
standards.
if
there
are
no
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
