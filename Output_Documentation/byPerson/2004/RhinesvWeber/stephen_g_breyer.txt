justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
typical.
i
mean,
what
i
have
in
the
statistics
is
that
about
36
percent
of
all
the
habeases
are
dismissed
for
failure
to
exhaust,
and
93
percent
of
all
of
the
habeas
petitioners
are
pro
se.
now,
the
conclusions
i
draw
for
that
is
it's
probably
these
pro
se
people...
i
mean,
93
percent
are
pro
se...
that
get
the
procedural
dismissals,
and
certainly
a
third
or
so,
if
we
agree
with
you,
of
all
of
the
habeas
petitions
filed
in...
in
federal
court
are
going
to
be
finished,
terminated.
the
door
is
closed
because
it
takes
a
federal
court
about
9
months
on
average
to
process
a
habeas.
now,
you
just
take
that
and
you
say,
we've
closed
the
door
of
the
federal
court
to
a
third
of
all
the
habeas
petitioners.
and
if
i
had
thought
that
congress
wanted
that,
then
i
might
say
fine.
but
i
thought
that
duncan...
and
i
know
i
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
case,
but
i
felt
the
majority
had
a
pretty
good
point
on
the
language,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
but
what
i
didn't
think
they
had
such
a...
i
mean,
i
couldn't
find
much
of
a
congressional
purpose
one
way
or
the
other
there.
i
thought
the
purpose
of
the
statute
of
limitations
is
really
to
get
people
to
file
their
petitions.
once
they
file
them,
they
have
a
year
but
it's
tolled.
you
know,
i
mean,
you
understand
the
thing.
i...
i'm
really
looking
for
you
to
tell
me
some
tremendously
strong
congressional
purpose
that's
served
so
strong
that
you
want
to
knock
a
third
of
the
petitioners
out
of
federal
court
forever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
pretty
simple.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
door
is
closed
forever.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
seem
to
have
made
a
mistake
here
quite
a
lot.
why
do
these
statistics
come
out
the
way
they
do?
i
mean,
it
is
just
as
easy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you.
why...
why
aren't
they
filing...
why...
why
are
they
all
filing
so
many,
36
percent
filing
in
the
wrong
court?
why
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
don't
agree
with
that
you
were
saying
or
you
do
agree
with
that,
i
know.
the...
but
the...
the
question
that
i
would
have
is,
is
there
anything
the
other
way?
i
mean,
in
duncan,
you
know,
i
was
dissenting
and
the
thing
that
sort
of
moved
me
is
i
couldn't
imagine
congress
really
cared
about
this.
i
mean,
what
they
do
is
they
want
to
have
you
file
within
a
year.
and
they
say,
well,
but
if
you
filed
within
a
year
and
you're
in
state
court,
we
don't
care
anymore.
you're
being...
if
you
file
in
the
wrong
state
court,
you're
tolled.
we
don't
really
care
once
you're
proceeding.
and
now,
however,
if
you
go
in...
into
federal
court
by
mistake
instead
of
state
court
by
mistake,
well,
you're
out
of
luck
on
a
random
basis.
some
judges
will
get
you
back
in
on
time.
other
judges
won't.
is
there
anything
in
the
history
or
anywhere...
i...
i'm
interested
in
the
history
from
your
point
of
view,
as
much
as
the
other.
is
there
anything
that
suggests
that
congress
cared
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
either
way.
