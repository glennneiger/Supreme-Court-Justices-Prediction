justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
unquestionable.
the...
the
issue
really
is
whether
it's
an
abuse
of
that
discretion
to...
to
grant
a
stay
and
abeyance
when
the...
the
petitioner
comes
before
the
court
for
habeas
without
having
exhausted
in
state
court.
i
mean,
that's
the
question.
i
think
everybody
will
stipulate
that
there's
power
to...
to
stay
proceedings,
but
is
it
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
do
so
in
these
circumstances
given
the
statute
that...
that
wants
a
1-year,
prompt
resort
to
the
federal
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it's
a
free
ride
if
you
say...
so
long
as
you
get
in
within
the
1-year
period,
the
court
can
then
give
you
another
3
years
or
as
long
as
the
court
thinks
is
reasonable
for
you
to
go
back
and...
and
do
what
you
were
supposed
to
do
before
you
arrived.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
is
a
frustration
of
the
1-year
statute
of
limitations.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
fair
for
you
to
say
he
loses
his
right
to
federal
review--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
we
wouldn't
necessarily
take
that
case,
whereas
you
say
he'd
have
a
right
to
go
into
federal...
federal
habeas.
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that...
that
happens
often
with
time
limits.
i
mean,
it
depends
on
when
the
court
finishes
its
job
and
so
forth.
what
do
you
do
about...
about
our
opinion
in...
in
duncan
v.
walker
where
we
refused
to
toll
the
limitation
period
during
the
pendency
of
a...
of
the
federal
proceeding
and...
and
said,
in...
in
justification
of
that
holding,
by
tolling
the
limitation
period
for
the
pursuit
of
state
remedies
and
not
during
the
pendency
of
applications
for
federal
review,
2244
provides
a
powerful
incentive
for
litigants
to
exhaust
all
available
state
remedies
before
proceeding
in
the
lower
federal
courts?
you
are
now
urging
us
to
eliminate
that
incentive
entirely.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
sometimes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you
said...
you
said
in
your
brief
that...
that
it's
always
in
the...
with
the
possible
exception
of
capital
cases,
it's
always
in
the
interest
of
a
habeas
applicant
to
get...
get
it
decided
as
soon
as
possible.
that's
not
really
true.
sometimes
it's...
it's
in
his
interest
to
delay
it
as
much
as
possible.
witnesses
will
die.
people
will
move
away.
all
sorts
of...
there
are
all
sorts
of
reasons
why
he...
he
might
want
to
delay
the
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you...
you
don't
really
think
we
can
hold
that
line,
giving
less
favorable
treatment
to
somebody
who's...
who's
trying
to
argue
against
a
capital
penalty,
less
favorable
treatment
to
him
than
somebody
who's...
who
just
wants
to
avoid
10
years
in
jail?
that's
just
not
going
to
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
how...
how
general
is...
is
this
problem?
and...
and
to
what
extent
is
it
tied
to
the
fact
that
you
can
bring
a
second
habeas
in
south
dakota?
i
mean,
in...
in
most
states,
if
this
had
happened,
i
presume,
when
you
went
back
to
the
state
court,
the
state
court
would
say,
you
know,
you
didn't...
you
didn't
put
in
these
claims
the
last
time
around
and
they're
procedurally
barred.
isn't
that
what
would
happen
in...
in
most
other
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
what
would
happen
in
these
other
states
as
the...
is
that
the
court
would
grant
the...
the
stay
of
proceedings
in
order
to
let
him
go
back
to
the
state
court
and
be
told
after
however
long
it
takes
that...
that
his...
his
claims
are
now
procedurally
barred.
do
you
think
the
federal
court
would
simply
make
its
own
determination
that
the
claims
would
be
rejected
by
the
state
court
and
therefore
it
would
not
stay?
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure...
i'm
not
sure
it's...
it's
true,
are
you,
that...
that
the
reason
people
get
into
these
situations
is
because
they
were
pro
se.
that
wasn't
the
case
here.
i...
i
think
they
probably
get
into
this
situation
very
often
because
they
have
a
better
or
at
least
a
different
lawyer
at
the
federal
habeas
stage
than
they
had
at
the
state
habeas
stage,
and
this
new
lawyer
sees
additional
claims
that...
that
he
wants
to
make.
isn't...
isn't
that
exactly
what
happened
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
it...
it
could
be,
i
suppose,
that
these
people
have
nothing
else
to
do
sitting
around
in
the
jailhouse,
and...
and
having
written
their
state
petition,
they
sit
around
for
a
few
more
months
and
they
say,
you
know,
there
are
a
few
more
claims
i
could
make.
i
think
that's...
it's
as
simple
as
that.
and...
and
what
the
statute
is
designed
to
do,
i...
i
think
you're
telling
us,
is
to
say,
look
it,
be
careful.
make
all
your
claims
in
the
state
court
the
first
time.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
too
much
to
demand.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
without
going
back
to
the
state
court,
i
don't
see
anything
in
this
statute
which
indicates
that
congress
expected
everybody
who
comes
into
federal
court
with
unexhausted
claims
to
have
time
to
remedy
that
defect
by
running
back
to
state
court
and...
and
filing.
this
statute
doesn't
give
any
such
indication.
and
it's
clear
that
will
never
happen
if
he
files
on
the
364th
day
after
the
conclusion
of
the
state
proceedings.
right?
i
mean,
his
year
is
up
already.
even
if
the
judge
decides
the
question
the
next
morning,
it's
too
late.
so
i...
i
don't
know
why
we
have
to
be
concerned
about
giving
him
some
entitled
second
chance
to
go
back
to...
to
state
court.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
statute
that...
that
guarantees
or
that
even
envisions
that.
and
i...
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--general
long,
do...
do
those
states
that
apply
stay
and
abey
make
a
distinction
between
whether
the
person
who
comes
with
unexhausted
claims
has
exhausted
some
claims
in
state
court
and
ones
who
haven't?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
that
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
get
a
second
bite,
why
shouldn't
you
get
a
first
bite?
i
mean,
i...
i
don't
see...
i
don't
see
any
reason
for
treating
preferentially
the...
the
person
who
files
in
state
court
but
does
not
file
new
claims,
which
he
should
have
known
to
file
at
that
time,
and
treating
the
person
who
comes
to
the
federal
court
with
those
new
claims
but
doesn't
have...
doesn't
have
even
one
that
he
took
to
state
court.
i...
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
be
merciful
to
one
and
not
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're...
but
you're
telling
me
the
states
do
draw
a
distinction.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean...
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--rococo
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr....
mr.
lange,
why...
why
isn't...
gee,
you
have
lange
and
long.
why
isn't
attorney
general
long's
assertion
sensible?
that
is
to
say,
it's
an
extraordinary
thing
to
have
federal
district
courts
in
all
criminal
cases
reviewing
the
work
of
state
supreme
courts.
we...
we
got
into
this
in
an
era
when
we
couldn't
trust
state
supreme
courts,
especially
in
racial
cases.
but
that's
where
we
are
now.
but
why
is
it
unreasonable
to
say,
look,
you
get
one
shot
at
coming
to
federal
court?
and
if...
if
you...
if
you
bungle
that
and
you
haven't
exhausted
first,
we're
not
denying
your
claims.
go
back
to
state
court.
we're
just
not
going
to
reintervene
as
federal
courts.
your...
your
claims
are
not
dead.
justice
is
not
denied.
you
just
have
to
go
back
through
the
state
system
and
we're
not
going
to
blue
pencil
the
work
of
the
state
system
a
second
time.
that's
all.
why
isn't
that
reasonable?
