justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there's
no...
there's
no
abuse
of
discretion
here.
why?
because
we
have
an
interest
in
having
all
of
the
claims
exhausted?
if...
if
it's
no
more...
if
it's
as
broad
as
that,
then
there's
no
aedpa
statute
of
limitations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
the
price
of
suspending
the
1-year
statute
of
limitations
that
congress
thought
was
central
to
aedpa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
of
the
problems
is
that
the
statute
encourages
prompt
resolution
in...
in
the
federal
system
as
well,
and
under
a
stay
and
abey
procedure,
you
could
have
a
district
judge
who
lets
the
matter
sit
for
9-10
months
and
all
of
a
sudden
issues
a
stay
and
abey.
how
are
we
going
to
control
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
then
he's
protected
in
the
state
system,
and
if
he
needs
federal
review,
he
can
come
here
on
direct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
he
can
come
to...
here...
this
court
on
direct
review.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
can
come
to
this
court
on
certiorari
after
the
state
decision
in
the
second...
in
the
second
habeas.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it...
i
take
it
that
one
of
the
answers
to
the
observation
that
the
federal
court
is
closed
to
a
third
of
the
claims
is
that
that's
not
true
with
respect
to
the
exhausted
claims.
the...
the
petition
can
simply
be
purged
as
to
unexhausted
claims
and
as
to
the
exhausted
claims,
the
courthouse
door
remains
open.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
you
suggesting
then
that
we
could
have
a
rule,
oh,
somewhat
like
the
grant
of
a
preliminary
injunction?
if
it's
a
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits,
if
it's
a
fundamental
right,
if
there's
reason
for
maybe
mistake
and
not
having
exhausted,
then...
then
you'd
allow
us
to
innovate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
if
you
have
that,
we
then
have
a
new
gothic
jurisprudence
where
we're
reviewing
discretion
on
a
collateral
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
the
suggestion
i
made--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
preferable
than
the
one
i
gave.
would
you
adopt
that
or
would
you
insist
just
that
there
be
no
stay
and
abey
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
there's...
it's
utterly
without
merit
and
he
can
deny
it,
which
he's
entitled
to
do
under
the
statute.
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
there's
a
high
probability
of
success
on
the
merits.
i'm
afraid
that
most
of
the
claims
are
going
to
fall
in
between.
the
district
judge
just
doesn't
know
absent
testimony,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
