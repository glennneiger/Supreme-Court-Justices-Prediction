mr.
roberto
a.
lange
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
stay
and
abeyance
is
the
proper
way
to
administer
the
total
exhaustion
rule
under
the
unique
facts
of
this
case.
several
justices
of
this
court
already
have
endorsed
stay
and
abeyance,
and
seven
of
the
eight
circuit
courts
of
appeals
that
have
considered
the
issue
have
permitted
stay
and
abeyance
under
similar
circumstances.
section
2254
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
granberry
v.
greer
and
strickland
v.
washington
make
clear
that
exhaustion
is
not
a
jurisdictional
requirement.
district
courts
have
the
inherent
authority
and
the
broad
discretion
to
issue
stays
in
cases
within
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
justice
scalia,
i
agree
with
your
framing
of
the
issue.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
and
i
also
believe
that
a
stay
under
these
circumstances
is
appropriate
under
the
statutes,
section
2254
and
2244,
and
is
consistent
with
those
statutes.
there
is
nothing,
as
justice
souter
noted
in
his
concurrence
in
duncan
v.
walker,
that
prohibits
the...
the
granting
of
a
stay
under
circumstances
such
as
these.
indeed--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--no,
your
honor.
i
believe
there
is
no
abuse
of
the
discretion
here
because
if
a
stay
had
not--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--well,
in
an
ideal
world,
they
would
be
presented
in
the
first
instance,
but
we're
dealing
with
a...
a
world
where
93
percent
of
petitioners
are
proceeding
pro
se.
your
honor,
stay
and
abeyance
does
force
a
petitioner
to
present
unexhausted
claims
in
state
court--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
see
this
as
a
suspension
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
rhines
met
the
aedpa
statute
of
limitations.
he
filed
when
only,
by
the
state's
own
admission,
8
to
14
days
had
run
on
his
1-year
aedpa
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
i
disagree
that
that
is
a
free
ride,
and
i
do
not
see
that
as
a
frustration
of
the
1-year
statute
of
limitations
when
a
petitioner
has
met
the
1-year
statute
of
limitations.
your
honor--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--your
honor,
congress
wanted
to
compress
certainly
the
time
between
exhaustion
of
the
state
remedies
and
the
time
when
the
petitioner
came
to
federal
court.
however,
congress
gave
unlimited
tolling
while
there
is
any
proceeding
going
in...
in
state
court.
i...
i
see
this
stay
and
abeyance
as
a
procedure
that
gets
applied
somewhat
infrequently
and
at
the
discretion
of
a
judge
to...
a
district
court
judge
to
apply
or
not
apply
when
it's
appropriate
to--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--i
think
it
truly
depends
on
the
circumstances
which
of
those
two
hypotheticals
present
a
more
compelling
case
for
stay
and
abeyance.
in
mr.
rhines
situation,
he
did
go
to
state
court
first
and
exhausted
the
vast
majority
of
the
35
separate
claims
that
he
has
raised.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
the
court...
or
the
state
challenged
12
of
the
claims
as
unexhausted.
the
district
court
found
eight
of
those
claims
to
be
unexhausted,
your
honor,
and
made
that
finding
after
mr.
rhines'
1-year
aedpa
period
had
run.
the
finding...
mr.
rhines
had
filed
in
february
of
2000
pro
se.
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
he
had
a
mixed
petition
and
that
there
were
eight
unexhausted
claims
was
made
in
july
of
2002.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
it's
actually
a
little
bit...
it's
longer
than
16
months,
your
honor.
the
district
court
referred
to
16
months,
but
it's
almost
2
and
a
half
years,
from
february
of
2000
to
july
of
2002,
your
honor.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
your
honor,
i
think
the
alternative
that
the
state
proposes
presents
an
even
more
troubling
illustration.
a
district
court,
of
course,
can
proceed
at
its
own...
at
its
own
rate,
grant
a
stay,
grant
the
terms
of
the
stay
as
it
sees
fit,
and
i
believe
that
takes
care
of
the
consideration
that...
that
your
honor's
question
indicated,
justice
kennedy.
the
suggestion
of
the
state
sets
up
a
situation
where,
according
to
the
state,
they
want
rhines
to
purge
his...
his
claim...
his
petition
of
the
unexhausted
claims
and
proceed
in
state
court
at
the
same
time,
which
is
unseemly
to
have
mr.
rhines
proceeding
on
27
exhausted
claims
in
federal
court
at
the
same
time
that
he
is
proceeding
on
8
claims
in
state
court.
now,
south
dakota
is
a
little
bit
unique.
it...
it
allows
a
second
state
habeas
action.
there's
no
time
bar
to
a
second
state
habeas
action.
in
fact,
the
south
dakota
legislature
has
made
a
policy
decision
that
indigent
prisoners
are
entitled
to
representation
of
counsel
in
their
first
habeas.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
your
honor,
the
problem
is
the
eight
claims
that
he
is
now
exhausting
in
state
court,
if
the
state's
approach
is
taken,
he
forever
sacrifices,
loses
the
right
to
federal
review
of
those
eight
claims.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
excuse
me.
under
direct
review?
is--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--your
honor,
as
a
matter
of--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--right.
your--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--thank
you
for
throwing
me
the
life
preserver.
i--
[laughter]
i
understand
this
court
grants
fewer
than
1
percent
of
the
cases,
so
as
a
practical
matter,
for
there
to
be
an
independent
review,
as
contemplated
by
section
2254(a),
it
does
require
a
district
court's
involvement.
as
a
practical
matter,
this
court
on...
on
cert
can't
be
expected
to...
to
conduct
that
review.
2254(a),
which
is
the
statute
that
grants
jurisdiction,
does
indicate
that
a
federal
court
shall
entertain
causes
of
this
action.
now,
2254(b)
does
contain
the
exhaustion
requirement
in
(b)(1)
and
makes
clear
in
(b)(2)
and
(b)(3)
that
it
is
not
jurisdictional.
the...
the
irony--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--i
don't
believe
so
anymore
than
you
would
have
to
reverse
in
part
rose
v.
lundy
to
go
with
the
state's
view.
and
let
me
explain.
the
approach
of
stay
and
abeyance
is
more
consistent
with
the
principles
of
rose
v.
lundy
than
the...
than
the
state's
position.
in
rose,
this
court
was
concerned
about
comity
and
federalism.
it...
it
serves
the
interests
of
comity
and
federalism
for
a
federal
court
to
suspend
consideration
of
a
federal
habeas
case
while
a
petitioner
has
a
remedy
and
is
actually
pursuing
it
in
state
court.
the
petitioner
may
be
granted
the
remedy
in
state
court,
which
in
turn
would
render
the
federal
petition
moot
altogether.
there
could
be,
between
the
competing
state
and
federal
cases,
competition
for
the
transcript
or
even
the
exhibits.
rose
v.
lundy
also
contemplated
a
process
that
would
not
unreasonably
impair
the
petitioner's
right
and
would
give
the
petitioner
the
choice
of
either
purging
the
unexhausted
claims
or
going
back
to
state
court,
exhausting
the
claims,
and
then
coming
back
to
federal
court
with
one
fully
exhausted--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--the
only--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--your
honor,
i...
i
would
disagree
that
this
is
a
total
frustration
of
congress'
time
limiting...
time
limiting.
again,
congress
granted
unlimited
tolling
while
a
petitioner
is
pursuing
remedies
in
state
court.
congress
was
not
attempting
to
frustrate
or
impede
the
petitioner's
right
to
seek
state
court
relief
or--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
this
does
an
end
run
because
this
is
different
than...
than
tolling.
first
of
all,
in
tolling
it's
automatic
under
a
statute,
and
stay
and
abeyance
is
always
discretionary
with
the
court.
the
court
can
grant
or
deny
the
stay
and
abeyance
order,
alter
it,
revoke
it,
or
in
this
case,
put
time
limits
on
the
petitioner's
right
to
go
back
and...
and
forth.
also,
mr.
rhines
has
complied
with
the
aedpa
period.
he
did
file.
the
unusual
situation
that
could
result
here
is
if
you
assume
a
prisoner
b
who's
in
rhines'
same
position
and
files
at
the
same
time,
when
only
approximately
9
days
have
elapsed
on
his
aedpa
period.
petitioner
b,
let's
assume,
files
three
claims:
one
exhausted,
one
unexhausted,
and
one
there's
a
dispute
over
whether
it's
exhausted
or
not.
because
petitioner
b
had
a
short
trial
perhaps
or
draws
a
different
judge
in
the
district
of
south
dakota,
the
judge
can
rule
on
that
case
perhaps
within
100
days.
it
gives
petitioner
b,
under
my
scenario,
256
days
to
go
to
state
court,
exhaust
his
claims,
and
then
come
back
into
federal
court
with
one
fully
exhausted
petition.
rhines
would
be
in
the
position
of
prisoner
b
in
my
scenario
but
for
the
fact
that
his
claims
are...
are
much
more
complicated.
he
is
serving
a...
a
sentence
of
death.
he
did
have
a
long
trial.
and
under
that
situation,
it's
simply
unfair
to
someone
in
rhines'
place
to
have
his
right
to
a
review
of
the
eight
unexhausted
claims
cut
short
because
he
had
a
complicated
case
or
the
district
court
was
slow
in
getting
to
a
decision.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
no,
your
honor.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
i
believe
there's
always
a
very
powerful
incentive
to
prisoners
to
exhaust
in
full
because
if
they
file
a
mixed
petition,
they're
not
going
to
have
relief.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
(b)(1)
says
it
shall
not
be
granted.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
i
think
those
illustrations
are...
are
the...
very
much
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule,
as
this
court
recognized
in--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--well,
i
think
that's
then
the
district
court's
task
that
has
more
familiarity
with
the
particular
case.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
the
district
court
can
refuse
to
issue
a
stay
and
abeyance
order.
it
can
put
tight
deadlines
on
a
stay
and
abeyance
order.
the
district
court
can
revoke
a
stay
and
abeyance
order.
it
can
alter
it
if
there
is
delay.
i
believe
that
is
a
decision
that
should
be
left
to
the
court
that's
closest
to
the
facts,
the
district
court.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
you're
right,
justice
stevens.
i...
it's
difficult
to
develop
a
rule
that
distinguishes
between
the
two
classes,
but
i
do
believe
that's
in
the
realm
of
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
can
set
very
tight
deadlines
on
a
petitioner
returning
to
state
court
to
exhaust
remaining
remedies
like
the
court
here
set
a
deadline
of
60
days,
and
in
the
circuit
courts,
more
commonly
the
deadline
is
30
days
to
go
back
to
state
court
and
then
30
days
to
return
once
the
state
proceeding
is...
is
completed.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
i'm
not
advocating
less
favorable
treatment
or
more
favorable
treatment
for
that
matter.
i
believe
the
rule
has
to
be
consistent
between
the
two.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
yes,
he
was,
your
honor.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
well,
he
filed
his
federal
habeas
petition
pro
se.
the
counsel
was
appointed
shortly
afterwards,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
justice
ginsburg,
a
different
lawyer
gets
appointed
in
the
federal
court
system
than
represented
him
in
the...
in
the
state
court
system.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
i
think
that's
an
excellent
point
and
on
footnotes
9
and
10
of
the
yellow
brief,
there
is
a
litany
of
the
state
procedural
rules,
and
many
states
would
bar
a
second
habeas
or
would
put
a
strict
time
limit
that
the
petitioner
could
not
meet.
south
dakota
is
different
in
that
regard.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
south
dakota
allows
a
second
habeas
and,
indeed,
allows
a
petitioner
in
a
second
habeas
to
show
cause
for
a
default
by
proving
that
he
received
ineffective
assistance
of
habeas
counsel,
which
is
unique
among
the
states.
yes,
many
states
that
don't
allow
a
second
remedy
would...
would
not...
we
would
not
be
in
this
situation
that
we
are
here.
however,
south
dakota
does.
and
in
fairness
to
mr.
rhines,
it
makes
sense
to
stay
the
federal
petition
and
to
allow
him
to
exhaust
his
state
court
remedies
on
satisfaction
of
rose
and
to
come
back
with
a
fully
exhausted
claim.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
i...
i
believe
that
would...
could
be
and...
and
should
be
a
factor
in
a
district
court's
consideration
of
whether
to
grant
stay
and
abeyance,
your
honor.
the
state
has
expressed
concerns
about
delay.
there
are
four
reasons
why
those
concerns
are
overstated.
first,
in
the
3
and
a
half
years
since
duncan
v.
walker
was
decided,
there
have
been
cases
in
circuit
courts
of
appeals
that
have
approved
of
the
stay
and
abeyance
procedure.
none
of
those
cases
evidence
that
it
is
being
misused
or
is
causing
undue
delay.
second,
the
terms
of
the
stay
themselves
can
restrict
a
petitioner's
delay,
as
i've
already
recounted
the...
the
district
court
did
here.
third,
this
court
in
slack
v.
mcdaniel
addressed
very
similar
arguments
to
what
the
state
is
making
now
about
delay
through
a
second
habeas
filing.
and
this...
this
court
noted
that
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
vest
courts
with
flexibility
to
prevent
vexatious
or
delayed
litigation
and
that
there
are
other
reasons
why
those
concerns
expressed
in
slack
v.
mcdaniel
were...
were
overwrought.
fourth
and
finally,
on
the
prospect
of
delay,
as
already
mentioned
in
answer
to
one
of
justice
scalia's
questions,
the
vast
majority
of
petitioners
are
not
under
a
capital
sentence.
it
is
not
hyperbole
to
say
that
99.4
percent
of
federal
section
2254
habeas
petitioners
are
not
serving...
are
not
under
a
capital
penalty.
those
are
statistics
from
the
year
2000
from
the
department
of
justice.
and
those,
i
think
with
the
extremely
rare
exception,
are
people
who
believe
rightly
or
wrongly
that
they're
in
prison
because
their
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated
and
would
not
favor
delay
under
any
circumstance.
so
the
delay
concern
that
the
state
raises
is...
is
overwrought.
unless
there
are
other
questions,
i'd
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
yes,
i
do,
justice
stevens.
i
believe
that
a
district
court,
in
evaluating
a
request
for
stay
and
abeyance,
should
look
to
make
sure
that
the
petition
meets
the
standards
of
section
2254(b)(2)
which
is
the
provision
that
allows
a
district
court
to
reach
the
merits
of
unexhausted
claims
to
deny
them.
it's
similar
to
what
the
court
has
now
promulgated
as
rule
4
of
the
rules
governing
habeas
corpus
cases.
i
think
it
makes
sense
for
the
district
court
first
to
look
at...
at
whether
there's
merit
to
the
petition
because
there
really
is
no
sense
to
hold
in
abeyance,
pending
exhaustion
in
state
court,
claims
that
lack
merit.
obviously,
to
get
stay
and
abeyance,
the
petitioner
will
have
had
to
file
timely
within
his
aedpa
period,
and
the
court
will
have
had
to
have
held
the
case
either
through
the
expiration
of
the
aedpa
period
or
you
can
imagine
some
scenarios
where
on
the
364th
day--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--right,
and
those
should
be
circumstances
where
the
state
court
is
left
to
judge
whether
the
claim
has
merit
while
the
federal
court
proceedings
are
suspended,
are
abeyed
or
held
in
abeyance.
it
makes
sense,
under
the
exhaustion
norms
of
this
court,
to
let
the
state
courts
pass
judgment
first
on
claims
that
have
sufficient
merit
where
they
can't
be
disposed
of
under
rule
4
of
the
rules
governing
habeas
corpus.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
well,
this
is
mr.
rhines'
one
opportunity.
congress
did
give
in
section
2254(a)
jurisdiction
to
the
courts
and
said
the
federal
courts
shall
entertain
petitions
of
this...
of
this
nature.
so
this
is
a...
a
right
that
mr.
rhines
has
to
have
these
entertained.
he
filed
timely.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
well,
under
(b)(1),
a
claim
must
be
exhausted
to
support
relief
from
a
federal
court.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
and
these
claims...
if
under
the
petitioner
b
scenario,
the
court
had
ruled
promptly
or
the
claims
were
less
complex,
allowing
them
to
be
disposed
of
earlier,
mr.
rhines
could
have
had
or...
and
should
have
all
of
his
claims
before
the
district
court
to
be
resolved.
the
court
needs
to
be
watchful
here
not
to
penalize
mr.
rhines
and
people
who
are
in
similar
situations
because
they
have
complex
claims.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
no.
he
is
represented
by
counsel,
obviously,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
it
inappropriate
to
draw
lines
between
pro
se
and
represented
counsel,
though,
in
the
realm
of
habeas.
that
i
think
invites
trouble.
so
the
rule
you
formulate
is
obviously
not
only
for
rhines
but
for
pro
se
litigants
as
well
that...
that
deserve
consideration.
this
exhaustion
rule
is
not
to
be
an...
a
trap
for
the
unwary
pro
se
petitioner.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
exhaustion
rule,
as
this
court
said
in
keeney
v.
tamayo-reyes,
is
to...
not
to
erect
a
hurdle
on
the
path
to
federal
habeas
court,
but
to
channel
claims
into
an
appropriate
forum.
and
stay
and
abeyance
does
just
that.
it
prohibits
further
proceeding
on
a
mixed
petition
in
federal
court
and
channels,
indeed
requires,
as
a
term
of
the
order
that
the
petitioner
go
and
exhaust
the
remaining
state
remedy
and
come
back
to
court
with
one
exhausted
claim.
that
is
what
rose
v.
lundy
contemplated
and
allowed
with
the
dismissal
without
prejudice.
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
if
under
section
2254(b)(2)
it
does
not
meet
the
standard,
yes.
congress
has
allowed,
because
exhaustion
is
not
jurisdictional,
for
district
courts
to
reach
the
merits,
albeit
it
to
deny
exhausted
claims.
that's--
mr.
roberto
a.
lange
--thank
you.
