justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
shouldn't...
why
shouldn't
the
petitioner
for
habeas
have
to
first
go
to
the
state
court
and
exhaust
the
state
court
claims?
here
that
wasn't
done.
the
petitioner
eventually
ended
up
in
federal
court
with
a
laundry
list
of
30-some
unexhausted
state
claims,
for
goodness
sakes.
why
shouldn't
those
have
been
presented
in
the
first
instance
to
the
state
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
petitioner--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--didn't
go
to
the
state
court
with
this
enormous
laundry
list
of
unexhausted
claims.
i
mean,
what
do
we
do
to
encourage
the
procedure
to
be
followed?
congress
did
want
all
this
compressed
and
thought
people
should
apply
first
to
state
court
and,
when
those
are
exhausted,
then
within
the
time
limit
apply
to
federal
court.
but
this...
this
scheme
does
something
else,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
we
have
to...
would
we
have
to
reverse
in
part
rose
against
lundy
to
go
with
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
was
at
a
time
before
the
aedpa
enactment
that
tried
to
put
limits,
time
limits,
on
these
things.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
we
run
into
here,
is
a
total
frustration
almost
of
congress'
time
limiting.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
congress,
i
think
under
the
scheme,
envisioned
having
someone
make
all
the
state
claims
the
first
time
around,
gather
them
up
and
go
to
state
court,
and
let
them
take
as
long
as
they
like...
no
statute
will
run
until
that's
complete...
and
then
go
to
the
federal
court.
and
this
does
an
end
run
around
that
approach.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
long,
if
you
were
designing
a
system
to
set
standards
to
guide
the
federal
judge
in
deciding
how
to
treat
these,
what
standards
would
you
set?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
your
best.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
to
have
exhausted
claims
entertained.
right?
is
there
some...
do
you
say
there
is
some
absolute
right
to
have
the
federal
court
hear
unexhausted
claims?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
is
not
a
pro
se
petitioner.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
earlier
you...
you
suggested
that
in
your
view
the
district
court
could
deny
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
to
understand
what
it
is
about
you
have
to
remember
that
most
criminal
cases
are
heard
in
state
not
federal
courts
as
a
first
instance
matter,
and
after
a
trial
if
the
defendant
is
found
guilty
there
are
appellate
review
mechanisms
in
state
courts.
it
is
possible
after
all
state
court
review
is
finished
for
a
defendant
who
is
still
unhappy
or
unsatisfied
with
the
finding
of
guilty
or
the
sentence,
that
defendant
can
raise
federal
constitutional
issues
in
federal
court
after
the
completion
of
state
review.
now,
that
is
done
by
filing
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court,
and
some
years
ago
this
court
has
held
that
it
is
not
correct
for
a
federal
court
to
consider
and
hear
petitions
by
prisoners
coming
from
state
court
that
combine
in
their
claim
both
claims
that
were
never
heard
in
state
court
as
well
as
claims
that
have
been
resolved
already
in
state
court
and
this
involves
that
situation
and
the
petitioner
charles
rhines,
was
convicted
on
south
dakota
of
first-degree
and
burglary.
after
a
state
conviction
became
final
and
a
state
habeas
petition
was
denied,
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
federal
district
court.
by
that
time,
the
district
court
determined
that
eight
of
his
numerous
claims
filed
in
federal
court
had
never
been
exhausted
in
state
court
and
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
has
been
inactive
called
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act;
the
acronym,
i
believe
is
pronounced
aedpa,
and
it
has
a
one
year
statute
of
limitations
for
prisoners
to
file
for
federal
habeas.
so,
if
the
federal
court
had
dismissed
rhines'
petition
then
he
would
have
been
unable
to
refile
it
after
he
went
back
to
state
court
to
exhaust
his
unexhausted
claims.
as
a
result,
the
federal
district
court
entered
a
stay
of
the
federal
petition
and
held
it
in
abeyance
while
he
went
back
to
state
court
to
have
the
state
courts
hear
his
unexhausted
claims
and
then
return
to
the
federal
court.
now,
the
state
appeals
from
that
order
and
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
district
courts
do
not
have
authority
to
grant
such
a
stay,
absent
exceptional
circumstances.
we
then
accepted
the
petition
for
review
here
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
vacate
the
eighth
circuit's
judgment.
we
hold
that
at
federal
district
court
does
have
discretion
to
enter
a
stay
of
a
petition
that
contains
both
exhausted
and
unexhausted
claims
to
allow
the
petitioner
to
present
his
unexhausted
claims
to
the
state
court
in
the
first
instance
and
then
to
return
to
the
federal
court
for
the
review
of
his
total
petition
that
has
now
been
perfected.
we
think
that
aedpa
does
not
deprive
district
courts
of
the
authority
they
ordinarily
had
the
issue
stays
in
cases
that
are
properly
before
them.
it
does
however,
we
think,
circumscribe
the
court's
discretion,
because
when
a
stay
is
entered
frustrate
aedpa's
goal
of
finality
by
allowing
the
petitioner
to
delay
the
resolution
of
the
federal
proceedings.
for
these
reasons,
we
hold
that
a
stay
and
abeyance
order
in
the
federal
district
court
should
be
available
only
in
limited
circumstances
that
the
district
court
should
grant
a
stay
at
the
federal
habeas
proceedings
only
if
it
determines
there
was
good
cause
for
the
petitioner's
failure
to
exhaust
his
claims
first
in
state
court.
and
even
if
the
petitioner
has
good
cause
for
the
failure,
the
district
court
would
abuse
its
discretion
if
it
were
to
grant
a
stay
when
the
unexhausted
claims
are
plainly
meritless.
and
where
a
stay
is
appropriate,
we
also
hold
that
the
district
court
should
impose
reasonable
time
limits
for
the
petitioner
to
return
to
the
state
courts
for
review.
now
we
do
not
decide
whether
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
granting
rhines'
a
stay
and
we
leave
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand.

stevens

concurring
opinion
