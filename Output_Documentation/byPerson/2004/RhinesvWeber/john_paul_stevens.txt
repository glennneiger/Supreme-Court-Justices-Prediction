justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
now...
we'll
now
hear
argument
in
rhines
against
weber.
mr.
lange.
you
may
proceed,
mr.
lange.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
procedure
should
be
any
different
between
capital
cases
and
noncapital
cases?
we're
basically
talking
about
what
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion,
as
you
indicated
at
the
outset.
do
you
think
the
same
rule
should
apply
to
both,
or
do
you
think
there
might
be...
because
there
is
a
greater
incentive
to
delay
in
the
capital
case
than
there
is
in
the
noncapital
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
lang.
general
long,
we'll
hear
from
you,
please.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
difference
is
that
one
of
those
petitions
could
be
totally
dismissed
and
the
other
one
would
not
be.
if
there
were
no
exhaustion
whatsoever,
they...
they'd
plainly
dismiss
the
federal
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas,
if
there's
one
exhausted
claim,
they
could...
they
could
keep
the
federal...
petition
in
federal
court
and
stay
it
and
let
the
unexhausted
claim
be
exhausted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
judge
could
dismiss
the
others.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
general
long.
mr.
lange,
you
have
7
minutes
left,
and
normally
i
wouldn't
intrude
on
your
rebuttal
time,
but
i
would
like
to
ask
you
to
comment
on
one
thought.
do
you
think
it
would
be
appropriate
before
a
district
judge
ever
grants
a
stay
and...
and
abeyance
procedure,
to
make
some
kind
of
a
preliminary,
not
exactly
a
probable
cause
determination,
but
some
kind
of
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
arguable
merit
to
the
state
claim
that
he
wants
to
stay
the
proceedings
to...
to
allow
him
to
exhaust?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lange,
you
were
appointed
by
the
court,
and
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
services
and
for
the
quality
of
your
services.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
case
is
submitted.
