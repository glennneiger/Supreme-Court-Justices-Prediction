justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
difference...
would
you
say
there's
a
difference
between
a
case
where
the
petitioner
comes
into
federal
court
in
the
first
instance
with
this
laundry
list
or
as,
if
i
recall
correctly,
this
case,
goes
first
to
the
state
court
and
then,
when
it's
dismissed
from
the
state
court,
comes
to
federal
court
with
the
same
basic
list
which
has
been
exhausted,
plus
others
which
have
not?
would
you
distinguish
the
case
on
the
propriety
of
stay
and
abeyance
of
passing
up
the
state
court,
going
to
federal
court
first,
going
to
state
court
with
your
pro
se
petition
raising
a
bunch
of
claims
but
not
all
of
them,
and
then
coming
to
federal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many...
how
many
were
not
exhausted
of
that...
that
laundry
list?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
16
months.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
just
replay
the
order
of
the
proceedings?
the
first
petition
is
to
the
state
court.
was
the
defendant
in
that
first
state
habeas
represented
by
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
he's
been
represented
by
counsel
throughout.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
the
state
application
that
preceded
that...
he
was
represented
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
he
lost
his
representation
when
he
came
to
the
federal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
they're
all--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
ask
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--with
respect
to
this
case?
i
thought
this
case
was
such
a
good
illustration
of
the
problem.
if
claims
came
into
the
federal
court
neatly
labeled,
exhausted,
unexhausted,
then
i
think
that
you
would
have
a
very
strong
argument.
but
as
this
case
illustrates,
the
question
of
whether
it's
been
exhausted
or
not
is
something
on
which
people
can
disagree.
and
i
suppose
why
the
district
court
took
well
over
a
year
to
decide
this
case
is
the
petitioner
says,
i've
exhausted
everything,
and
the
prosecutor
says,
you
have
not
exhausted
12.
and
the
district
court
is
going
by
the...
going
over
these
one
by
one
and
says
in
the
end,
you're
both
wrong.
my
list
is
eight.
and
it's
that
problem
of
has
this
claim
been
exhausted.
now,
if
it
was
a
case
of
deliberately
withholding
a
case
from
state
court
and
bringing
it
up
fresh
in...
in
the
federal
court,
that
would
be
a
case
where
the
federal
court
should
say,
go
away,
you
didn't
even
try.
but
what
do
you
do
with
these
cases
where
it's
really
hard
to
tell
whether
the
claim
has
been
exhausted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
did
the...
the
district
judge
say
four
on
the
state's
list
have
been
exhausted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that...
that
would
take
care
of
the
four
claims.
how
about
the
other
four?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
those
could
be...
those
could
be
dropped
out
of
the
federal
complaint.
there
you're
saying,
district
judge,
you
would
be
abusing
your
discretion
because
admitting
that
he
hadn't
exhausted
these,
he
should
have
gone
immediately
to
do
that.
but
what
about
the
other
four?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
that's
so,
then
why
isn't
a
system
like
the
one
that
the
second
circuit
described
the
most
reasonable
thing
to
do,
that
is,
to
put
very
tight
deadlines
both
on
the
petitioner
and
on
the
federal
court,
that
is,
to
deny...
deny
the
stay
and
abey
when
the
prisoner
has
not
been
diligent,
to
put
a
tight
time
line
on
when
that
prisoner
has
to
go
to
state
court,
and
a
similarly
tight
line
on
returning
to
the
federal
court
after
the
state
court
is
done?
and
you
could
check
against
repeatedly
abusing
this
by
saying,
and
you
get
only
one
opportunity
to
do
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
see,
you
could...
there
are
two
things
in
rose
v.
lundy,
and
everybody
agrees
with
the
one,
you
must
exhaust
in
state
court.
you
cannot
have
the
federal
court
take
a
first
view
at
that
question.
you...
you
must
exhaust.
and...
but
then
rose
v.
lundy
also
said
without
prejudice,
and
your
reading
strikes
out
without
prejudice
not
based
on
the
defendant's
conduct,
not
based
on
the
petitioner's
conduct,
but
because
it
took
the
district
court
more
than
the
limitation
period
just
to
sort
out
which
claims
were
exhausted
and
which
weren't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the...
the
troublesome
thing
is
some
petitioners
will
be
able
to
do
just
what
you
said
in
south
dakota,
go
back
to
the
state
court
a
second
time,
because
they
had
a
swift
district
judge,
and
some
won't
because
the
district
judge
was
slow.
so
to
treat
identically
situated
petitioners
differently
not
because
of
any
lapse
on
the
petitioner's
part
but
solely
because
one
had
the
luck
to
get
before
a
swift
district
judge
and
the
other,
the
bad
luck
to
get
before
a
procrastinator,
that
seems
arbitrary
and
not
anything
that
congress
built
into
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
did
go.
did.
every
one
of
these
cases,
i
say
if
they
came
rushing
to
the
federal
court
first,
no
federal
judge
would
even
consider
giving
them
a
stay
so
they
can
go
to
the
first...
first
time.
but
these...
these
come
up
where
someone
has
gone
to
the
state
court
and
then
they
come
to
the
federal
court
with
a
new
petition
and
there's
arguments
about
what
they
exhausted
and
what
they
didn't.
i'm...
i'm
leaving
out
the
person
who
never
went
to
the
federal...
state
court
at
all.
that
person
is...
is
not
the
category
that
this
case
represents.
this
case
represents
the
one
who
goes
to
state
court
and
comes
to
the
federal
court
and
he
has
arguably
some
additional
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
hasn't
the
second--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
again--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
come...
i
come
back
to
the...
the
second
circuit
tried
to
deal
with
that
problem
and
why
isn't
that
adequate?
they
didn't
leave
the
district
judges
to
do
whatever
was
their
will.
