h.
souter
no,
but
the
point--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
what
about
the
exceptional
case?
i
mean,
how
do
we
avoid
the
exceptional
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
can
do
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
is
your
answer
to...
to
your...
your
brother's
answer
on
this,
and...
and
that
is,
that
the...
the
existence
of
stay
and
abey
as
a
possibility
is
not
a
right
to
stay
and
abey?
and...
and
if
a
district
judges
find
that
a...
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
defendant
is
gaming
the
system,
because
he's
a
capital
defendant
and
wants
to
delay
or
wants
delay
for
any
other
reason,
there's...
there's
no
requirement
that...
that
there
be
a
stay
and...
and
abeyance
order.
and
why...
why
doesn't
that
take
care
of
what
i...
i
think
is
a
very
legitimate
issue
that
you
raise?
why
isn't
that
a...
a
sufficient
answer
to
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
again,
there's
no
question
about
that.
and...
and
in
a
perfect...
sort
of
in
a
perfect
system,
i
think
your
objection
would
be
unanswerable.
the
trouble
with
the
system
we've
got
is...
is
the
trouble
that...
that
is...
is
undisputed
here,
and
that
is,
that
most
of
these
petitions,
the
overwhelming
number
of
them,
are
going
to
be
pro
se
petitions.
exhaustion
can...
can
be
tricky.
the...
the
statute
of
limitations
is...
is
going
to
run
and...
and
an
individual
can
end
up
in
the...
in
the
situation
that
this
one
had.
what...
what
he's
asking
for,
in
effect,
is
how
do
we
tinker
with
the
system,
in
effect,
to
prevent
its
being
a...
a
very
unfair
burden
on
people
who
don't
have
the
sophistication
to
help
themselves.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
i
know
but
there's...
what...
what
is
your
answer
on
the
merits
to
the
fact
that
most
of
the
people
who
are
going
to
ask
for
stay
and
abey
are...
are
going
to
be
pro
ses,
or
at
least
have
gotten
into
the
mess
that
they're
in
as
a
result
of
pro
se
representation,
and...
and
that...
that
exhaustion
in
close
cases
can
be
a
very...
very
tricky
issue?
what...
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
rose
and
lundy
also
assumed
that
they
could
go
back
to
state
court
and...
and
in...
in
fact
this
could
be
done
without
wiping
out
the
claims.
and
the
difference
between
the
situation
in
rose
and
lundy
and
the
situation
we've
got
now
is
the
difference
which
is
focused,
i
think,
in...
in
justice
ginsburg's
four
claims
as
to
which
there
was
disagreement
even
between
the
district
court
and...
and
the
state
as
to
whether
there
was
exhaustion.
there...
there
isn't
a...
a...
as
a...
as
a
systemic
matter
across
the
united
states,
there
simply
isn't
a
way
for
most
of
these
people
to
go
back
and
litigate
their
state
claims.
rose
and
lundy
assumed
there
was.
now
there
isn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
not
be...
it...
it
will
be
waived.
i
mean,
if...
if...
on
your
theory,
he...
he
jumps
from
the
frying
pan
of
nonexhaustion
into
the
fire
of
waiver.
that's...
that's
no
answer
to
the
problem.
