mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
through
the
controlled
substances
act,
congress
has
comprehensively
regulated
the
national
market
in
drugs
with
the
potential
for
abuse.
and
with
respect
to
schedule
i
substances,
like
marijuana,
that
have
both
a
high
potential
for
abuse
and
no
currently
accepted
medical
use
in
treatment,
congress
categorically
prohibits
interstate
trafficking
outside
the
narrow
and
carefully
controlled
confines
of
federally
approved
research
programs.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
with
respect,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
either
lopez
or
morrison
casts
any
doubt
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
controlled
substances
act,
and
i
think,
in
particular,
that's
because
the
decisions
in
lopez
and
morrison
cited,
with
approval,
cases
like
darby
and
wickard,
and
preserved
those
cases.
and,
of
course,
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
kennedy
did
so,
as
well.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
o'connor,
let
me
first
say
that
i
think
it
might
be
a
bit
optimistic
to
think
that
none
of
the
marijuana
that's
produced
consistent
with
california
law
would
be
diverted
into
the
national
market
for
marijuana.
and,
of
course,
the
controlled
substances
act
is
concerned,
at
almost
every
step
of
the
act,
with
a
concern
about
diversion,
both
of
lawful
substances
from
medical
to
non-medical
uses
and
from
controlled
substances
under
schedule
i
into
the
national
market.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
with
respect,
justice
o'connor,
on
this
record,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
reason
to
assume
that
california
is
going
to
have
some
sort
of
almost
unnatural
ability
to
keep
one
part
of
a
fungible
national
drug
market
separate.
and
i
think
congress,
here,
made
important
findings
that
you've
alluded
to,
not
just
that
there's
a
national
market,
not
just
that
the
intrastate
and
the
interstate
markets
are
linked,
but
that
drugs
are
fungible,
and
that
because
drugs
are
fungible,
it's
simply
not
feasible,
in
congress'
words,
to
regulate
and
separately
focus
on
only
drugs
that
have
traveled
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
you
would
say
they
were
relevant,
justice
stevens,
and
that's
because--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
because
i
think
it
is
a
reality,
in
responding
to
justice
o'connor's
question...
i
think
that
in...
obviously,
in
all
of
these
commerce--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
in
your
hypothetical...
and
if
i
could
turn
to
that...
i
still
think
the
analysis
would
not
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
truth
of
the
supposition
that
diversion
could
be
prevented,
because
this
court,
in
a
series
of
cases,
including
darby,
wickard,
wirtz,
and
perez,
has
made
clear
that
the
relevant
focal
point
for
analysis
is
not
the
individual
plaintiff's
activities
and
whether
they
have
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
but
whether
the
class
of
activities
that
congress
has
decided
to
regulate
has
such
a
substantial
effect.
and,
in
this
case,
there's
no
question
that
the
overall
production,
distribution,
and
possession
of
marijuana
and
other
schedule
i
substances
has
a
profound
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
no,
it
doesn't,
justice
scalia,
but
let
me
respond
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
been
clear,
at
least
since
the
lottery
case,
that
congress'
authority
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
includes
the
authority
to
prohibit
items
traveling
in
interstate
commerce
and
to
declare
something
contraband
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
a
perfectly
rational
exercise
of
congress'
judgement
to
treat
marijuana
and
other
schedule
i
substances
not
just
as
contraband
in
interstate
commerce,
but
as
contraband
simpliciter,
as
contraband
for
all
purposes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
there's
some
truth
to
that,
justice
scalia,
but
let
me
say
this.
i
think
what
i'm
saying
is,
i'm
taking
the
rational
that
this
court
accepted
in
wickard,
and
i'm
applying
it
to
a
different
regulatory
regime.
here,
congress--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
with
respect,
justice
stevens,
if
you
took
a
look
at
the
controlled
substances
act,
itself,
and
read
it
literally,
you'd
assume
that
there
was
absolutely
no
market,
period,
in
schedule
i
substances.
but
the
reality
is,
there's
a
$10.5
billion
market...
illegal
market,
albeit...
but
market
in
marijuana
in
the
united
states,
on
an
annual
basis.
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
stevens,
that's
only
true
if
there
will
be
no
diversion,
to
get
back
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
in
the
same
way
that
the
federal
government
has
had
trouble
stamping
out
the
marijuana
market
entirely,
i
think
california
is
going
to
have
parallel
problems
in
absolutely
preventing
diversion.
but
just--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
absolutely,
justice
kennedy.
and,
in
that
context,
what
this
court
said
is,
even
though
it
was
focused
on
what
was
going
to
be
an...
both
in
that
case
and
generally,
an
interstate
activity,
congress
did
not
have
to
just
look
at
the
particular
plaintiff's
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
but,
rather,
the
effect
of
the
entire
class
of
activities.
and
if
i
could--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
whole
point
of
the
wickard
case
was
to
extend
rationales
that
it
applied
previously
to
commerce
to
activity
that
the
court
described
as
economic,
but
not
commercial.
and
i
think
the
production
and
distribution
and
possession
of
marijuana
is
economic
in
the
same
way
that
the
production
of
wheat
was
in
the
wickard
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right,
justice
souter,
and
that
is
the
logic,
not
just
of
me,
but
of
this
court's
cases,
in
cases
like
darby
and
wickard
and
wirtz
and
perez.
and
i
point
to
the
wickard
case,
in
particular,
only
because
it,
too,
involves
a
non-commercial
enterprise
or
a
non-commercial
production
of--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
o'connor,
it
could
be...
i
mean,
any
case
can
be
distinguished
on
the
facts,
of
course,
but
i
think
what's
important
is,
this
court,
in
wickard,
itself,
recognized
that
the
case
was...
it
was
only
interesting
because
a
portion
of
the
regulated
wheat
involved
wheat
that
was
going
to
be
consumed
on
the
farm.
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
that's
true,
justice
o'connor,
but
this
court,
basically,
in
its
opinion,
justice
jackson,
for
the
court,
put
aside...
to
one
side
all
of
the
grain
that
was
going
to
go
in
interstate
commerce,
since
that's
easy
under
our
existing
precedents.
this
case
is
only
interesting,
he
said,
because
it
involves
wheat
that's
going
to
be
consumed
on
the
farm.
and
he
specifically
talked
about
both
the
wheat
that
would
be
fed
to
the
animals,
but
also
the
wheat
that
would
be
consumed
by
the
family.
and
what
he
said
is,
the
intended
disposition
of
the
particular
wheat
wasn't
clear
from
the
record
of
the
case.
and,
by
that,
i
take
him
to
mean
that
it
wasn't
relevant
to
the
court's
analysis
in
upholding
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
to
the
wheat
at
issue
there.
and
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
way
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
worked
is,
it
applied
to
all
the
wheat
that
was
grown
in
excess
of
the
quota,
and
so
it
applied
to
the
wheat
that
was
used
by
the
family
for
consumption
of
their
own
bread.
and,
nonetheless,
this
court
upheld
that
as
a
valid
commerce
clause
regulation.
and
so
i
think,
by
parity
of
reasoning,
all
of
the
marijuana
that's
at
issue
and
covered
by
the
controlled
substances
act,
whether
it's
lawful
under
state
law,
whether
it's
involved
in
a
market
transaction
or
not,
is
fairly
within
the
congress'
commerce
clause--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--authority.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it
does,
justice
kennedy,
because,
as
i
said
earlier,
in
responding
to
a
question
from
justice
scalia,
i
think
if
you're
talking
about
a
context
where
congress
has
the
undoubted
power
to
prohibit
something
in
interstate
commerce
entirely,
and
has
exercised
that
power,
so
it
treats
something
as
effectively
contraband
in
interstate
commerce,
and
then
takes
the
complementary
step,
especially
in
light
of
the
fungibility
of
the
product,
and
says,
"we're
just
going
to
treat
this
as
contraband
simpliciter.
"
i
think
that
judgement
by
congress
has
a
very
definite
link
to
interstate
commerce
and
its
unquestioned
authority
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
and
i
do
think
there's
a
sense
in
which
when
congress
is
regulating
the
price
of
something,
there's
certainly
a
temptation
to
excise
out
relatively
small
producers
and
for
congress
to
say,
"well,
we
can
still
have
effective
regulation
if
we
regulate
the
vast
majority
of
production.
"
but
with
respect
to
something
that's
unlawful
to
have
and
is...
and
has
very
significant
risks
precisely
because
it's
unlawful,
any
little
island
of
lawful
possession
of
non-contraband
marijuana,
for
example,
poses
a
real
challenge
to
the
statutory
regime.
it
would
also,
i
think,
frustrate
congress'
goal
in
promoting
health.
and
i
think
the
clearest
example
of
that
is
the
fact
that,
to
the
extent
there
is
anything
beneficial,
health-wise,
in
marijuana,
it's
thc,
which
has
been
isolated
and
provided
in
a
pill
form,
and
has
been
available
as
a
schedule
iii
substance,
called--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--marinol.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
we
would
take
the
position,
based
on
our
reading
of
the
oakland
cannabis
case...
and,
obviously,
different
justices
on
this
court
read
the
opinion
differently
and
had
different
views
on
the
extent
to
which
the
medical-necessity
defense
was
foreclosed
by
that
opinion...
i
would
imagine
the
federal
government,
in
that
case,
if
it
took
the
unlikely
step
of
bringing
the
prosecution
in
the
first
place,
would
be
arguing
that,
on
the
authority
of
oakland
cannabis,
the
medical-necessity
defense
was
not
available.
but
i
think,
in
any
event,
what
is
important,
at
this
point,
is
that
we
don't
have
a
prosecution;
we
have
an
affirmative
effort
to
strike
down
the
controlled
substances
act
in
an
injunctive
action.
and
i
think,
in
that
context,
certainly
justice
souter
is
right,
that
this
court's
precedents
make
clear
that
one
doesn't
consider
only
the
individual's
conduct,
but
the
entire
class
of
activities
that's
at
issue.
i
think,
in
this
regard,
it's
also
worth
emphasizing
that
a
deeper
flaw
in
the
respondent's
argument,
that
california
law
is
somehow
relevant
here
or
the
fact
that
their
conduct
is
lawful
under
california
law,
is
that
there's
a
mismatch
between
what
california
law
makes
lawful
and
what
might
be
considered
relevant
for
arguing
that
there's
an
attenuated
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
because
the
california
law
makes
the
possession
of
marijuana
for
medical
use
lawful
under
state
law,
without
regard
to
whether
that
marijuana
has
been
involved
in
a
cash
transaction
or
has
crossed
state
lines.
and
so,
if
respondents
are
right
on
their
commerce
clause
theory,
i
don't
see
how
they
can
be
right
because
their
conduct
is
lawful
under
state
law
or
because
their...
that
marijuana
use
is
medical.
if
they're
right,
then
i
think
their
analysis
would
extend
to
recreational
use
of
marijuana,
as
well
as
medical
use
of
marijuana,
and
would
extend
to
every
state
in
the
nation,
not
just--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--those
states
that
made
it
lawful.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think
that
is
permissible,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that's
what
this
court's
cases
in
wirtz,
in
darby,
in
wickard--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--under
the
commerce
clause,
i...
that's
exactly
right,
that
would
be
our
position.
it
is
constitutional
on
its
face,
and
it...
and
because
of
that
line
of
authority,
an
as-applied
challenge
can
be
brought,
but
the
legal
test
that's
applied
in
the
as-applied
challenge
is
one
that
considers
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
a
whole--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--oh,
absolutely,
justice
o'connor,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
with
respect,
i
don't
think
so.
and
i'd
say
two
things
about
it.
one,
this
court,
in
morrison
and
lopez,
was
very
important
to
emphasize...
thought
it
was
very
important
to
emphasize
two
things:
one,
that
the
activity
there
was
non-economic
in
a
way
that
differentiated
it,
even
from
wickard;
and,
second,
the
court
also
made
it
clear
that
the
regulation
that
there...
there
was
not
essential
to
the
effectiveness
of
an
overall
regulatory
scheme.
and
i
think,
on
both
points,
this
case
is
on
the
constitutional
side
of
the
line
that
separates
the
lopez
and
the
morrison
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
understand
that...
i
understand
that's
their
argument,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
don't
understand
how
this
court,
in
lopez,
could
have
said
that
wickard
involved
non-economic
activity
if
this
activity
is
not
also
covered.
you're
talking
about--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
sorry
if
i
misspoke.
economic
activity.
because
what
you're
talking
about
here
is
the
possession,
the
manufacture,
the
distribution
of
a
valuable
commodity
for
which
there
is
a
ready...
unfortunately,
a
ready
market,
albeit
an
illicit
market.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
be
speculating,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
think
the
price
would
go
down.
and
i
think
that
what...
and
that,
in
a
sense,
is
consistent
with
the
government's
position,
which
is
to
say,
when
the
government
thinks
that
something
is
dangerous,
it
tries
to
prohibit
it.
part
of
the
effort
of
prohibiting
it
is
going
to
lead
to
a
black
market,
where
the
prohibition
actually
would
force
the
price
up.
and
there
is
a
sense
in
which
this
regulation,
although
not
primarily
designed
as
a
price
regulation...
the
controlled
substance
act,
i
think,
does
have
the
effect
of
increasing
the
price
for
marijuana
in
a
way
that
stamps
down
demand
and
limits
the...
and
in
a
way
that
reduces
demand.
and
i
think
that's
all
consistent
with
congress'
judgement
here.
and
if
i
could
return
for
a
second
to
the
point
about
marinol,
what's
important
there
is
that
the
process
of
manufacturing
of
marinol,
and
isolating
the
one
helpful
component,
does
two
things.
one,
the
manufacturing
process
allows
there
to
be
a
safe
use
for
one
of
the
components
in
marijuana.
but
it
also
provides
an
unambiguous
hook
for
congress
to
exercise
its
commerce
clause
authority.
and
yet
the
overall
regime
of
trying
to
get
people
to
use
more
healthful
substances,
and
not
use
things
like
crude
marijuana
that
have
harmful
effects,
is
undermined
if
congress
can't
also
address
that
which
is
more
harmful,
but
is
distinct
only
because
it
is
capable
of
being
locally
produced.
and
that's
exactly
what
crude
marijuana
is.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think,
in
responding
to
that,
justice
stevens,
i
would
say,
obviously,
for
purposes
of
federal
law,
the
idea
of
medical
marijuana
is
something
of
an
oxymoron,
because
the
federal
government
treats
it
as
a
schedule
i
substance.
now,
notwithstanding
that,
some
doctors
may
make
a
different
judgement
about
a
particular
patient;
but
that's
something
that
this
court,
i
think,
has
previously
understood,
that
the
federal
regulatory
regime
does
not
allow
individual
patients
or
doctors
to
exempt
themselves
out
of
that
regime.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
the
import
of
the
rutherford
decision
with
laetrile.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it
depends
on
the
exact
hypothetical
you
have
in
mind.
i
think
the...
the
judicial
finding
that
i
think
would
be
appropriate,
and
this
court
would
not
have
to
ignore
in
any
way,
is
a
finding
by
the
d.c.
circuit
that,
in
a
particular
case
where
there's
a
rescheduling
effort
before
the
fda,
that
the
underlying
judgement
of
the
fda
refusing
to
reschedule
is
invalid,
arbitrary,
capricious.
that's
the
way
to
go
after
the
finding
that
marijuana
is
a
schedule
i
substance
without
a
valid
medical
use
in
treatment.
this
is
not
a
situation
in...
and
your
hypothetical
might
respond
to
a
different
statute
that
raised
a
harder
question,
where
congress
made
such
a
medical
finding,
and
then
just
left
it
there
without
any
mechanism
to
adjust
the
finding
for
changing
realities.
but,
here,
congress
made
it
clear
that
a
process
remains
open
to
reschedule
marijuana
in
a
way
that
gets
it
onto
schedule
ii
or
schedule
iii.
and
i
think
it's
wrong
to
assume
that
there's
any
inherent
hostility
to
the
substances
at
issue
here.
i
mean,
the
fda,
for
example,
rescheduled
marinol
from
schedule
ii
to
schedule
iii
in
a
way
that
had
the
effect
of
making
it
easier
to
prescribe
and
more
available.
but
i
think
what's
going
on
with
the
fda
is
an
effort
to
try
to
counterbalance
the
risk
for
abuse,
the
risk
for
diversion,
with
these
other
considerations
of
getting
safe
medicine--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--available
to
patients--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--there
have
been
a
number
of
those
petitions
that
have
been
filed.
there
was
one
recently
rejected,
i
think
as
recently
as
2001;
it
may
be
1999.
there
was
also
a
series
of,
kind
of,
a
four
or
five-iteration
effort
to
change
the
rescheduling
that
culminated
in
a
d.c.
circuit
opinion
in
the
early
'90s.
so
there's
definitely
been
these
efforts.
but
on
the
current
state
of
the...
of
the
record,
there
just
is
not
a
justification
for
changing
the
schedule.
and
i
think
both
of
the
briefs
talked
a
little
bit
about
the
institute
of
medicine's
study
about
the
medical
efficacy
of
marijuana.
and
i
think
one
thing
that's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
that
study
comes
to
a
conclusion
about
is,
whatever
benefits
there
may
be
for
the
individual
components
in
marijuana,
that
smoked...
smoked
marijuana
itself
really
doesn't
have
any
future
as
medicine,
because...
and
that's
true,
i
think,
for
two
reasons.
one,
there's
something
like
400
different
chemical
components
in
crude
marijuana
that
one
would
smoke,
and
it's...
it
just,
sort
of,
belies
any
logic
that
all
400
of
those
would
be
helpful.
and
a
big
part
of
the
process
of
medicine,
generally,
is
to
take
raw,
crude
material
that
somebody
could
grow
in
their
garden,
and
actually
have
people
who
do
this
for
a
living
get
involved
in
a
process
of
synthesizing
and
isolating
the
beneficial
components,
and
then
manufacturing
and
making
that
available.
the
second
reason
that
smoked
marijuana
doesn't
have
much
of
a
future
as
medicine
is,
as
i
think
people
understand,
smoking
is
harmful;
and
that's
true
of
tobacco,
but
it's
also
true
of
marijuana.
and
so
the
idea
that
smoked
marijuana
would
be
an
effective
delivery
device
for
medicine,
i
think,
is
also
something
that
really
doesn't
have
any
future
as
medicine.
what
does
have
a
future
for
medicine,
of
course,
is
an
effort
to
synthesize
and
isolate
the
beneficial
component.
that's
been
done
with
marinol.
it
is
true
that
some
people
have
difficulty
tolerating
the
pill
form
that
marinol
is
available
in.
and
there's
ongoing
research
to
try
to
figure
out
different
ways
to
deliver
that
substance.
but
there
is,
in
a
sense,
a
little
bit
of
a...
and
the
institute
of
medicine's
study
has
about
five
pages
discussing
marinol,
and
it
makes
the
point
that
there's
something
of
a
tradeoff.
because
one
of
the
downsides
of
marinol,
as
opposed
to
marijuana,
is
that
it
takes
longer
to
get
into
the
bloodstream.
but
that's
also
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
fda
has
made
a
judgement
that
marinol
is
less
subject
to
abuse,
because
it
takes
longer
to
get
into
the
drug-stream,
and
so
it
doesn't
have
the
characteristic
of
street
drugs
that
tend
to
be
abused,
which
is
a
very
quick
delivery
time
between
the
taking
of
the
substance
and
the
time
that
it
has
an
effect
on
the
system.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
this
court
to
get
on
a
path
of
starting
to
second-guess
congress'
judgement
about
defining
a
class
of
activities--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
souter,
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
court
could
draw
a
line.
i
think
it
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
police
that
line
over
the
broad
variety
of
cases.
i
think
it
would
find
it
every
bit
as
frustrating
as
policing
the
line
in
hammer
against
dagenhart
that
this
court
abandoned
in
darby.
with
that,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
understand
respondents'
position,
it's
effectively
that
their
clients,
and
clients
like
them,
in
their
use
of
medical
marijuana,
is
somehow
so
hermetically
sealed
from
the
rest
of
the
market
on
marijuana
that
it
has
no
effect
on
that
market
on
marijuana
and
no
effect
on
the
government's
overall
regulatory
regime.
and
i
understand
that
to
be
true
largely
because
of
state
law.
and
one
of
the
many
problems
with
that
mode
of
analysis
is
that
the
state
law
is
not
designed
only
to
carve
out
those
transactions
that
have
no
effect
on
interstate
commerce
or
no
effect
on
the
federal
regulatory
regime.
proposition
215
was
not
tasked
as
an
exercise
in
cooperative
federalism;
it
was
passed
as
an
effort
to
make
medical
marijuana
lawful
to
possess,
whether
you
bought
it
in
interstate
commerce,
whether
you
bought
it
with
the
marijuana
having
traveled
in
interstate
commerce,
whether
you
bought
it,
whether
you
grew
it
yourself.
there's
a
fundamental
mismatch
with
their
theory
that
really,
i
think,
undermines
their
theory.
now,
there's
the
question
now
about
what
kind
of
impact
this
would
have
on
the
federal
enforcement
scheme.
now,
we,
in
our
reply
brief,
try
to
use
the
numbers
from
one
of
respondents'
own
amici,
and
we
suggest
that
there's
a
hundred-thousand
people
that
might
be
lawful
medical
users,
if
their
position
prevails.
now,
obviously,
this
is
all
an
effort
in,
sort
of,
counter-factual
speculation,
so
the
numbers
may
be
a
bit
off.
but
they
suggest
that
our
own
government
numbers
are
somehow
better,
and
they
cite
them
on
page
18
of
the
red
brief.
but
the
only
numbers
on
the
red
brief
for
california
suggest
that,
in
the
four
counties
for
which
there
are
data,
there
was....5
percent
of
the
people
use
marijuana.
now,
if
you
extend
that
out
statewide
to
the
34
million
people
in
california,
that
gives
you
170,000
people.
so
their
numbers...
using
the
government
numbers
actually
give
you
more
potentially
affected
people.
i
think
in
trying
to
figure
out
how
many
people
would
be
affected,
it's
worth
considering
what
medical
conditions
are
covered.
and
this
responds
to
justice
kennedy's
last
question,
is
this
just
limited
to
aids
or
people
with
terminal
cancer?
and
it's
not.
and
if
you
want
to
look
at
what
is
covered
as
serious
medical
condition
under
the
statute,
you
can
turn
to
page
7(a)
of
the
red
brief,
in
the
appendix
to
the
red
brief,
and
it
suggests
that
a
serious
medical
condition...
there's
a
catchall
at
the
end
that
includes
subsection
12...
"any
other
chronic
or
persistent
medical
system
that,
if
not
alleviated,
may
cause
serious
harm
to
the
patient's
safety
or
physical
or
mental
health.
"
now,
i
think
that
is
an
exceedingly
broad
definition
of
a
serious
medical
condition
for
which
somebody
could
be...
get
a
recommendation
for
marijuana
for
medical
uses.
another
point
worth
considering,
in
considering
the
impact
on
the
federal
regulatory
regime
or
the
effectiveness
of
california
in
preventing
any
diversion,
is
to
take
a
look
at
two
cases
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief.
one
is
the
people
against
wright.
there's
somebody
who's
arrested
with
19
ounces,
over
a
pound,
of
marijuana.
they're
packaged
such
that
he
has
one
small
bag
in
his
pocket,
six
other
small
bags
wrapped
with
a
scale
in
his
backpack,
two
other
larger
bags
in
that
backpack,
and
then
a
pound
wrapped
in
a
shirt
in
the
back
of
his
truck.
and
yet
the
appellate
court
in
california
said
that
he
was
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury
with
the
theory
that
that
was
for
medical
use.
the
fact
that
he
had
a
scale,
and
the
fact
that
it
was
packaged
the
way
it
was,
could
be
explained
to
the
jury
because
he
had
just
boughten
it,
and
that
he
used
the
scale
to
make
sure
he
wasn't
ripped-off.
i
think
that
shows
that
it's
going
to
be
very
hard
to
enforce
the
regulatory
regime.
the
other
case
in
the
reply
brief
worth
mentioning
is
the
santa
cruz
case,
because
that's
a
case
where
a
federal
district
court,
after
raich
came
out,
said
that
it
could
not
enforce
the
da
and
the
controlled
substances
act
against
a
250-person
cooperative.
and
that
just
shows
that
this
is
not
something
that
will
be
limited
to
one
or
two
users
at
a
time,
but
will
have
a
substantial
impact
on
the
government's
ability
to
enforce
the
controlled
substances
act.
thank
you.
