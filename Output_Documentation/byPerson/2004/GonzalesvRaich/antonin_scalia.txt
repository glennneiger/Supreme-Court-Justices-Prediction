justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
not
an
interstate
commerce
that
you
want
to
foster.
i
mean,
in
these
other...
in
these
other
cases,
congress
presumably
wanted
to
foster
interstate
commerce
in
wheat,
in
wickard
v.
filburn.
congress
doesn't
want
interstate
commerce
in
marijuana.
and
it
seems
rather
ironic
to
appeal
to
the
fact
that
home-grown
marijuana
would
reduce
the
interstate
commerce
that
you
don't
want
to
occur
in
order
to
regulate
it.
i
mean,
you
know,
doesn't
that
strike
you
as
strange?
justice
antonin
scalia
absolutely.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
quite
a
different
rational
than
wickard
v.
filburn.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you're
not...
you're
not
appealing
to
the
fact
that
it
has
a
substantial
impact
on
interstate
commerce.
you're
appealing
to
the
fact
that
the
power
which
congress
has
to
prohibit
the
use
of
goods
carried
in
interstate
commerce
cannot
effectively
be
implemented
without
this
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
involved
economic
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know,
congress
has
applied
this
theory
in
other
contexts.
one
is
the
protection
of
endangered
species.
congress
has
made
it
unlawful
to
possess
ivory,
for
example.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
got
it
lawfully,
or
not;
or
eagle
feathers,
the
mere
possession
of
it,
whether
you
got
it
through
interstate
commerce
or
not.
and
congress'
reasoning
is,
"we
can't
tell
whether
it
came
through
interstate
commerce
or
not,
and
to
try
to
prove
that
is
just
beyond
our
ability;
and,
therefore,
it
is
unlawful
to
possess
it,
period.
"
now,
are
those...
are
those
laws,
likewise,
unconstitutional,
as
going
beyond
congress'
commerce
power?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
is
that
different
from
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
isolated
and...
i
understand
that
there
are
some
communes
that
grow
marijuana
for
the
medical
use
of
all
of
the
members
of
the
communes.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it's
before
the
court
when
you...
when
you
raise
the
policing
of
the
problem
by
california,
and
saying
it's
not
a...
it's
not
a
real
problem,
you
brought
it
before
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is...
which
is
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
an
individual
grower?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
what
basis--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
basis
is
there
to
draw
it
that
narrowly?
i
mean,
i
guess
if
we...
we
could
say
people
whose
last
name
begins
with
a
z.
you
know,
that
would
narrow
the
category,
too.
but
why
does...
why
does
that
make
any
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
california
hasn't
identified
individual
growers.
communes
are
okay,
as
far
as
california
law
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
they're
not
buying
and
selling.
i
mean,
you
can't
prove
they're
buying
and
selling.
there
are
just
a
whole
lot
of
people
there,
with
alleged
medical
needs.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
didn't
decide
that,
in
lopez,
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
gun
had
come
in
interstate
commerce.
if
the
statute
in
question
had
applied
only
to
guns
that
had
been
transported
in
interstate
commerce,
the
case
might
have
come
out
differently.
justice
antonin
scalia
sounds
like
wickard
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
always
used
to
laugh
at
wickard,
but
that's...
that's
what
wickard
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
had
he
not
eaten
the
wheat,
it
would
have
been
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
what
it
was
about,
as
far
as
the
court's
analysis
was
concerned.
to
be
sure,
there
were
a
lot
of...
there
was
a
lot
more
use
of
the
wheat
on
his
farm,
other
than
just
human
consumption,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
analysis
of
the
case
said,
"you
take
it...
you
take
it
out
of
the
stream
of
commerce
by
growing
it
yourself,
you
make
it
unnecessary
for
your...
to
buy
it
in
interstate
commerce.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
strange
phrase,
to
mean
"feeding
to
livestock"?
justice
antonin
scalia
"home-consumed"
is
feed
it
to
your
pig?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
is
this
not
economic
activity,
if
you
use
the
term
in
that
broad
sense?
this
marijuana
that
is
grown,
just
like
the
wheat
that
was
grown,
in
wickard,
since
it's
grown
on
the
farm,
doesn't
have
to
be
bought
elsewhere,
and
that
makes
it
an
economic
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
again,
i
don't
think
that's...
that
faithfully
represents
what
the
opinion
said.
i
think
the
opinion
covered...
including
the
amount
that
he
consumed
himself,
and
his
family
consumed.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
opinion
make
a
point
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
opinion
make
a
point
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it
was
a
point
of
the
court's
analysis
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i...
could
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--remote,
remote,
remote
economic
effect.
