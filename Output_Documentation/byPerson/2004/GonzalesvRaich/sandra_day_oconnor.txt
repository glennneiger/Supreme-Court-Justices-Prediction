well,
mr.
clement,
the...
i
think
it
is
reasonably
clear
that
congress
spoke
very
broadly
in
the
act,
and
the
question,
for
me,
turns
on
whether
lopez
and
morrison
dictate
some
concerns
with
its
application
in
this
context.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
in
wickard,
of
course,
you
had
a
wheat
grower,
a
small
farmer,
and
his
wheat
did,
in
part,
go
in
the
national
market.
you
don't
have
that
here.
as
i
understand
it,
if
california's
law
applies,
then
none
of
this
home-grown
or
medical-use
marijuana
will
be
on
any
interstate
market.
and
it
is
in
the
area
of
something
traditionally
regulated
by
states.
so
how
do
you
distinguish
morrison?
and
how
do
you
distinguish
lopez?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
looking
at
this
broad
challenge,
do
we
have
to
assume
that
the
state
of
california
will
enforce
its
law?
i
mean,
if
it
turns
out
that
it
isn't
and
that
marijuana
is
getting
in
the
interstate
market,
that
might
be
a
different
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
do
take
issue
with
that.
as
i
read
the
record
in
wickard,
it
involved
a
small
farmer.
a
portion
of
his
wheat
went
on
the
interstate
market.
it
also
was
fed
to
cattle,
which,
in
turn,
went
on
the
interstate
market.
he
used
some
of
it
himself,
but
part
of
it
was
commercial.
i
think
wickard
can
be
distinguished
on
the
facts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
other
portion
is
a
matter
of
xxx
interstate
commerce.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
in
morrison,
did
the
court's
opinion
not
say
that
congress
cannot
justify
commerce
cause...
clause
legislation
by
using
a
long
but-for
causal
chain
from
the
activity
in
question
to
an
impact
on
interstate
commerce?
i
mean,
the
court
certainly
made
that
statement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
cuts
against
what
you're
saying.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
this
limited
exception
is
a
non-economic
use...
growing
for
personal
use,
under
prescription--
