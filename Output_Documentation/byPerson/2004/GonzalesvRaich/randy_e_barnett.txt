mr.
randy
e.
barnett
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
two
points
to
make.
first,
the
class
of
activities
involved
in
this
case
are
non-economic
and
wholly
intrastate.
second,
the
federal
prohibition
of
this
class
of
activities
it
not
essential...
is
not
an
essential
part
of
a
larger
regulatory
scheme
that
would
be
undercut
unless
the
intrastate
activity
were
regulated.
if
you
accept
the
government's
contrary
contentions
on
either
of
these
two
points,
ashcroft
v.
raich
will
replace
wickard
v.
filburn
as
the
most
far-reaching
example
of
commerce
clause
authority
over
intrastate
activity.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
it
can
be,
or
it
might
not
be.
if
you
possess
an
item
that
came
from
the
market
or
is
going
to
the
market,
simple
possession
could
easily
be
a
part
of
the
marketplace.
but
if
you're
in
possession
of
an
item
that
you've
made,
yourself,
that
is
disconnected
from
the
market...
it
didn't
come
from
the
market
and
it's
not
going
to
the
market--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--that...
the
fungibility
issue
is
in
this
case,
but
the...
but
a...
the
fact
that
a
good
is
fungible
does
not
make
it
a
market
good,
and
it
does
not
make
the
possession
of
that
good
an
economic
activity.
or--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--not
if
they're
an
essential
part
of
a
larger
regulatory
scheme
that
would
be
undercut,
unless
those
activities
are
reached.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
because
this
class
of
activities...
because
it's
been
isolated
by
the
state
of
california,
and
is
policed
by
the
state
of
california,
so
that
it's
entirely
separated
from
the
market--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--that
class
of
activities
is
not
before
the
court.
that
is
actually
before--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--but
that
class
of
activities
could
be...
could
be...
if
this
court
limits
its
ruling
to
the
class
of
activities
that
is
before
the
court,
that
class--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--which
is--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--an
individual
who
is
growing
it
for
her...
him
or
herself,
who
has...
or
has
a
caregiver
growing
it
for
her--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--for--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--justice
scalia,
we
believe
it
makes
sense
because
we
are
talking
about
a
classification
of
activities
that
has
been
identified
by
the
state
of
california,
and
which
is
rational
to
distinguish
from--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--well,
it's
not
entirely
clear
whether
communes
are
okay,
as
far
as
the
california
laws
are
concerned.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
because
if,
in
fact,
commercial
activity
is
taking
place,
if
buying
and
selling
is
taking
place--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--the
support
would
come
from
the
exception
to
lopez
and
morrison
that
the
government
is
urging
that
the
court
adopt,
that
the
congress
can
reach
non-economic
activity
that's
intrastate,
that's
wholly
intrastate,
if
doing
so
is
essential
to
a
larger
regulatory
scheme
that
would
be
undercut
if
they
can't
reach
it.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
well--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--by
saying
that
it's
all
going
to
depend
on
the
regulatory
scheme,
what
the--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--purpose
of
the--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--well,
you've
raised
at
least
two
different
practical
issues.
one
is
the
fact...
the
number
of
people
who
are
in
the
class,
and
the
second
is
the
ability
to
identify
whether
they
properly
belong
in
the
class.
as
for
the
number
of
people,
we
are
talking
about
a
very
small
number
of
people.
they
say
a
hundred-thousand.
they
get
their
figures
from
the
national
organization
from
reform
of
marijuana
laws.
our
figures
in
our
brief
come
from
the
government.
the
figures
show
it's
a
very
small
fraction
of
persons
that
would
be
involved.
and
their
argument
is
basically...
and
the
logic
of
your
hypothetical
is
premised
on...
the
more
people
that
go
into
the
illicit
market,
the
better
for
federal
drug
policy,
because
that
will
drive
the
price
up.
you
have
to...
what
we're
take...
we're
doing
is,
we're
taking
people
out
of
the
illicit
drug
market,
which
then,
under
your
hypothetical,
would
lead
to
a
reduction...
and
justice
kennedy's
suggestion...
would
lead
to
a
reduction
in
the
price
of
the
illegal
market,
which,
the
opposite
would
be,
they're...
it's
good
for
federal
policy
to
have
more
people
in
the
illicit
drug
market,
because
that's
going
to
drive
the
price
up.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
of
course
not.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
of
course
not.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
but
the...
but
the...
but
the
scheme
of...
but
the
class
of
activities
that
have
been
authorized
by
the
state
of
california
will
take
people
out
of--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--well--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--well,
within
this
exception...
the
threshold
issue...
i
do
want
to
make
sure
that
i
focus
on
this...
the
threshold
issue,
which
is
the
issue
that
has
occupied
most
of
our
time
so
far,
is
whether
the
activity
here
is
economic
or
non-economic.
the
government
claims
it's
economic,
we
claim
it's
non-economic.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
right.
so
the
threshold
issue
that
is...
that...
upon
which
lopez
and
morrison
terms...
turns
is
whether
it's
economic
or
non-economic.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
if
you
accept
the
government's
definition
of
economic,
then
every...
then
washing
dishes,
today,
would
be
economic,
and
that--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--would
be
within
the...
within
the
power
of
congress
to
reach.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
well,
they
have
an...
they
have
a
very
strong
incentive
not
to
get
it
on
the
street,
because
getting
it
on
the
street
is
going
to
subject
them
to
criminal
prosecution,
under
both
california
and
federal
law,
as
well
as
the--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--but
we're
talking...
in
that
case,
we're
talking
about
people
who
are
using
it
for
sport,
for
recreation.
we
are
talking
about
a
class
of
people
here
who
are
sick
people,
who
don't
necessarily
want
to
violate
the
law.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
the
government,
in
their
brief,
asserts
that
the...
that
the
possession
statute
that
currently
exists
provides
a
deterrent
effect,
which
is
why
they...
which
is
their
explanation
for
why
they
failed
to
enforce
the
possession
statute
that
they
say
is
so
essential
to
the--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--regulatory
scheme.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
yes,
your...
yes,
your
honor,
because
there's
the...
that's
the
second
step
of
the
analysis.
the
first
step
of
the
analysis
is
the
economic/non-economic.
if
you
don't...
if
the
court
stops
there,
then
they
could
also
apply
in
these
other
states.
but
then
if
the
court
adopts--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
but
a
limiting
principle
is
the
one
that
i...
was
identified
by
the
court
in
lopez
in
which
the
government
is
asserting
that
if
it's
an
essential
part
of
a
broader
regulation
of
economic
activity
to
reach
this
activity,
then
it
may
be
reached.
and
the
difference
between
states
in
which
there
is
a
state
law
enforcement
that's
confining
the
class,
and
that
there
is
a
discrimination
between
legal
and
non-legal
use,
is
completely
different
from
a
practical
enforcement
standpoint
than
a
state
in
which
there
is
no
differentiation.
just
think
of
the
existence,
for
example,
of
identification
cards,
which
the
state
of
california
is
going
to
be
issuing,
like
driver's
license
cards.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
well,
because...
but
this
is
the
sort
of
regulation...
the
sort
of
effectiveness
of
the
regulation
that
will
be
at
issue
and
which
is,
in
fact...
i
believe
the
court
should
be
in
the
position
of
trusting
the
state
of
california
to
be
able
to
administer
its
regime.
there
is
no
regime
in
other
states
to
trust,
and,
therefore,
the
argument
that
it
is
necessary
to
reach
that
activity,
and
a
lot
of
other
activity
in
states
in
which
the
states
are
not
attempting
to
pursue
the
health
of
their
citizens...
the
goal
of
preserving
the
health
of
their
citizens
this
way,
that
would
fall
under
the
exception
which
this
court
suggested
in
lopez--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--well--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--justice
breyer,
that's
the
reason
why
that
exception
has
to
be
narrowly
treated,
so
it
doesn't
reach
your
result.
[laughter]
if
that
exception
were
treated
as
broadly
as
you
suggested
that
it
should
be
in
your
dissent
in
morrison,
then
the
game
is
up,
the
exception
will
swallow
the
rule,
and
lopez
and
morrison
will
be
limited
to
their
facts.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
but
this
case
is
completely
unlike
those
cases.
this
case
is
completely
isolated.
in
lopez,
that
gun
probably
did
come
through
interstate
commerce,
not
that
i
believe
it
should
have
made
any
difference,
but
it
probably
did.
here,
we're
talking
about
substances
that
don't.
so
there's
just
no
literal
connection
between
this
class
of
activities
and
this
interstate
market.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
i...
no
doubt,
your...
i...
and
i
wasn't
suggesting
otherwise,
justice
scalia.
i'm
just
suggesting
that,
here,
we
have...
exactly,
that
if
there
had
been
that
interstate
connection
in
lopez,
the
case
might
have
come
out
different.
there
is
no
interstate
connection
whatsoever
in
this
class
of
cases.
none.
the
only
way
to
make
it
an
interstate
connection
is
through
some
sort
of
hypothetical
economic
substitution
effect
in
which
somebody
who's
doing
something
over
here
is
going
to
have
an
affect
on
somebody
else
who's
doing
something
over
there.
there
is
no
connection.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
well,
wickard,
your
honor--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--wickard--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--had
that
case
been
about
eating
wheat,
that
case
would
never
have
arisen.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
it's...
the
entire
analysis...
the
entire
proof
that
the
court
relied
upon
in
wickard
was
proof
of
the
economic
impact
of
home-consumed
wheat
on
the
farms.
and
by
"home-consumed",
it
did
not
mean
eating
at
the
family...
at
the
family
table;
it
meant
feeding
to
your
livestock
and
then
putting
it...
your
livestock--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--but
the--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--but,
yes,
that's
exactly
what--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--that's
exactly
what
that
general
term...
how
that
general
term
was
used
in
this
case.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
with
all
respect--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--with
all
respect,
what...
that's...
i
was
about
to
make
that--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--right.
right.
what
the
court
was
using
here
was
the
narrower...
the
traditional
definition
of
"commerce"
that
justice
thomas
has
been
urging
this
court
to
adopt.
and
they
were
saying
that,
"we
are
not
going
to
limit
ourselves
to
that
narrow
definition
of
"commerce".
"
it
would
include,
for
example,
agriculture
and
production.
that's
all
going
to
be
reachable,
even
though
it's
not
commerce,
in
the
traditional
sense.
but
what
we
would
call
it
today,
and
i
believe
what
the
court
correctly
called
it,
in
lopez,
was
"economic
activity".
production
is
economic
activity.
manufacturing
is
economic
activity.
but...
it's
not
commerce,
but
it's
economic
activity
that
can
be
reached.
and
that
is
the
activity...
that's
not
only
the
activity
that
farmer
filburn
was
engaged
in;
that
was
the
activity
that
the
statute
was
aimed
at.
the
statute--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--what
made
it
an
economic
activity
in
wickard
was
the
fact
that
it
was
part
of
commercial
enterprise,
that
it
was
being
used
on
the
farm...
not
in
interstate
commerce,
but
part
of
the
commercial
enterprise
of
the
farm.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
the...
look,
i...
for
whatever
it's
worth,
it's
worth
remembering
that
the
statute
exempted
small
commercial
farms.
people
who
had
backyard
gardens
weren't
even
included
within
the
regulatory
regime.
the
regulatory
regime
was
about
regulating
or
stopping
or
restricting
the
supply
of
wheat
that
got
into
the
market,
or
that
could
have--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--pardon
me?
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
it...
it
was
mentioned
in
the
opinion.
it
was
not...
it
was
not
a
major
point
of
this
opinion.
but--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--this--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--can
i
pick
"trivial
impact"?
[laughter]
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
the
only
effect
it
could
have
on
the
price
would
be
a
slight
trivial
reduction,
if
it
has
any
effect
at
all,
because
it's
going
to
withdraw
users
from
the
illicit
drug
market.
and
to
the
extent
that
they
are
now
in
the
illicit
drug
market...
and
we
don't
know
whether
they
are
or
not--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--well,
it
would
reduce
demand
and
reduce
prices,
i
think.
but--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--yes.
[laughter]
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
it
could
be,
your
honor,
but
that
also
illustrates--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--but
whatever...
i
don't
know,
because
i
don't
know
the
number
of
people
using
chemotherapy.
but
whatever
the
number--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--thank
you,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
well,
two
things.
first
of
all,
whatever
number
it
is,
it's
going
to
be
confined
to
people
who
are
sick,
who
are
sick
enough
to
use
this.
that
is
not
an
infinitely
expandable
number,
the
way,
for
example,
recreational
activity
is,
where
lots
of
people
could
just
decide
to
do
it.
we're
talking
about
people
who
qualify,
on
a
physician's
recommendation,
for
this
particular
activity.
that
will
limit
the
number.
but
the
amount
of
the
people...
the
effect
on
commerce
only
matters
if
the
wickard
v.
filburn
aggregation
principle
applies
to
the
class
of
activities
in
this
case,
and
it
does
not
apply
to
the
class
of
activities
in
this
case
if
they
are
non-economic,
as
we
assert
that
they
are.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
lopez
and
morrison
stand
for
the
proposition
that
activities
that
simply
have
an
effect
on
the
market
are
not
necessary...
that
does
not
make
them
economic.
this
court
rejected
that
proposition,
that
just
because
an
activity
has
an
effect...
an
economic
effect
makes
the
activity,
itself,
economic.
it
adopted
a
principle
that's
less
than--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--but
just...
just
have
it...
just...
whether
an
activity
is
economic,
you
have
to
look
to
the
activity,
itself,
and
an
economic
activity
is
one
that's
associated
with
sale,
exchange,
barter,
the
production
of
things
for
sale
and
exchange,
barter.
this
whole
court's
jurisprudence
since
the
new
deal
has
been
premised
on
the
ability
to
tell
the
difference
between
economic
activity,
on
the
one
hand,
and
personal
liberty,
on
the
other.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
the
premise
of
our...
the
premise
of
our
economic
claim
is
the
nature
of
the
activity
involved,
not
necessarily
its
effect,
but
the
kind
of
activity
it
is.
the
idea...
for
example,
you...
prostitution
is
an
economic
activity.
marital
relations
is
not
an
economic
activity.
we
could
be
talking
about
virtually
the
same
act.
and
there
is
a
market
overhang
for...
from
private
sexual
relations
to
prostitution,
but
we
don't
say
that
because
there
is
a
market
for
prostitution,
that,
therefore,
everything
that
is
not
in
that
market
is
economic.
we
look
at
the
activities,
and
we--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--yes.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
well--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
that
whole
process
wouldn't
dictate
what
the
power
of
congress
is
to
reach
this
activity--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--i
would--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--i
would
simply
ask
your
honor
to
read
the
amicus
brief
by
rick
doblin,
in
which
it
describes
the
government's
obstruction
of
scientific
research
that
would
establish
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
cannabis
by
denying
supplies
of
cannabis...
of
medical...
of
cannabis
for
medical
experimentation.
and
then
i'd
ask
your
honor
to
read
the
institute
for
medicine's
report,
that
both
the
government
and
i...
and
we
have
relied
upon
in
our
briefs.
there
has
been
no
impeachment
of
this
report
by
the
national
academy
of
sciences
on
the
medical
effect.
and
what
they
say
is
that
the...
that
what
information
we
have
is
that
cannabis
does
have
a
substantial
medical
effect.
smoked
cannabis
does
carry
with
it
harms
associated
with
it,
as
the...
as
general
clement
correctly
pointed
out.
it
does
carry
with
it
these
ancillary
harms.
but
when
people
are
sick
and
people
are
suffering
and
people
are
dying,
they
may
be
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
these
long-term
harms
in
order
to
get
the
immediate
relief,
the
life-saving
relief
that
cannabis
has
demonstrably
been
able
to
provide.
i'd
just
ask
your
honor
to
look
at
that,
which
is
in
the
record.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
they
are
limited
to
a
list
of
illnesses
that
are
in
the
statute.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
some
of
which
are
life-threatening
and
some
of
which
are
not,
your
honor.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
that's
correct,
your
honor.
she
has...
she
has
severe
back
spasms
and
pain
that
cannot
be
controlled
by
conventional
medicines.
she's
a
law-abiding
citizen.
this
goes
back
to
the
issue
of
what
the...
incentives
there
are
that
are
created
by
this.
this
is
a
law-abiding
woman,
who
has
never
been
interested
in
the
illicit-drugs
market.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
yes.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
and
seizure--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--of
these
plants.
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
well,
it
is...
it
is
an...
we're
seeking
an
injunction
to
prevent
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
against
these
two
persons,
which
includes
forfeiture,
which
has
already
happened
in
this
case.
we've
already
had
diane
monson's
plants
seized
by
the
drug
enforcement
authority.
that
is
not
something
that
we...
that
we...
that
has
anything
to
do
with
criminal
prosecution,
and
yet
that
puts
at
risk
her
supply
of
medicine,
the
supply
of
medicine
she
needs
to
get
by,
to
relieve
her
suffering.
i
see
my
time--
mr.
randy
e.
barnett
--is
up.
