i
suppose
some...
one
answer
to
that
case
is
the
perez
case,
with
loan
sharking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
a
harder
or
easier
case
than
wickard
when
we
know
that,
in
wickard,
it
was
lawful
to
buy
and
sell
wheat,
and,
here,
it
is
unlawful
to
buy
and
sell
marijuana?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
this
make
your
case
easier,
in
a
sense,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
we
rule
for
the
respondents
in
this
case,
do
you
think
the
street
price
of
marijuana
would
go
up
or
down
in
california?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
your
first
point,
can't
we
infer
from
the
fact
that
there's
an
enormous
market,
commercial
market,
for
any
given
commodity,
that
simple
possession
of
that
commodity
is
a
form
of
participation
in
the
market?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it's
fungible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
should
have
thought
that
regular
household
chores
of...
say,
performed
in
an
earlier
time
mostly
by
women,
was
classically
economic...
washing
dishes,
making
bread.
and
now
you
say
growing
marijuana
isn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thirty-four
million.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
prescriptions,
under
california
law,
limited
only
to
those
people
with
life-threatening
illnesses?
