justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're...
no,
i
was
going
to...
your
whole
point,
i
take
it,
is
that
the
two
particular
patients
in
this
case
are
simply...
simply
cannot
be
taken,
for
our
purposes,
as
representative
in
the
fact
that
they
are
getting
the
marijuana
by,
i
think,
growing
it
themselves
or
being
given
it.
you're
saying,
you
cannot
take
that
fact
as
a
fact
from
which
to
generalize
in
deciding
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
your
point
a
few
minutes
ago
about...
it
was,
sort
of,
a
categoric
point...
you,
in
effect,
said,
"if
this
argument
succeeds
with
respect
to
medical
use
of
marijuana,
the
next
argument
is
going
to
be
recreational
use,
and
there's
no
real
way
to
distinguish
between
them.
"
wouldn't
this
be
a
way
to
distinguish
between
them?
that
in
deciding
what
class
you
are
going
to...
or
what
subclass
you're
going
to
consider
from
which
to
generalize,
you
simply
ask
the
question,
"what
good
reasons
are
there
to
define
a
subclass
this
way?
"
in
this
particular
case,
the
good
reasons
to
define
a
subclass
of
medical
usage
are
the
benefits...
whether
you
accept
the
evidence
is
another
thing...
but
the
benefits
which
the
doctors
say
that,
under
present
circumstances,
you
can
get
from
smoking
it,
as
opposed
to
taking
the
synthesized
drug.
there's
no
such
argument,
i
would
guess,
in
favor
of
recreational
marijuana
usage
as
a
separate
category.
and,
for
that
reason,
isn't
there
a...
isn't
there
a
good
reason
to
categorize
this
as
narrowly
as
the
respondents
are
doing
here,
just
medical
usage,
without
any
risk
of
generalizing
the
recreational
usage?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may...
oh,
that
may
be,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
separate
argument,
because
you're...
you
were
arguing
before
that
if
you
recognize
medical
usage,
you
don't
have
any
way
of
drawing
the
line
against
private
recreational
usage.
and
i'm
suggesting
that
you
do
have
a
reason
for
drawing
that
line,
and
it's
the
benefit
for
medical
usage,
if
you
accept
the
evidence;
whereas,
there
is
no
reason
to
categorize
recreational
usage
separately,
and
that
seems
to
me
a
category
argument,
rather
than
a
respect-for-congress
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
even--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
even
if
we
accept
your
definition
of
economic,
i
don't
see
that
it
is
a
basis
upon
which
we
ought
to
make
a
category
decision.
you
say
it's
non-economic
because
one
of
these
people
is
a...
is
a
self-grower,
another
one
is
getting
it
from
a
friend
for
nothing.
but
i
don't
see
what
reason
that
you
have
given,
or
any
reason
that
you
haven't
given,
for
us
to
believe
that,
out
of...
now
i'm
going
to
assume,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
a
hundred-thousand
potential
users...
everybody
is
going
to
get
it
from
a
friend
or
from
plants
in
the
backyard.
seems
to
me
the
sensible
assumption
is,
they're
going
to
get
it
on
the
street.
and
once
they
get
it,
under
california
law,
it's
not
a
crime
for
them
to
have
it
and
use
it.
but
they're
going
to
get
it
in
the
street.
why
isn't
that
the
sensible
assumption?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
the...
it's
also
the
case
that
approximately
10
percent
of
the
american
population
is
doing
that
every
day,
if
i
accept
the
figures
in
the
government's
brief,
and
they're
not
getting
prosecuted.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
i
am
a
sick
person,
i'm
going
to
say,
"look,
if
they're
not
prosecuting
every
kid
who
buys,
what,
a
nickel
bag
or
whatever
you
call
a
small
quantity
today,
they're
not
going
to
prosecute
me,
either.
"
i
mean,
there's
not
going
to
be
any
incentive,
it
seems
to
me,
to
avoid
the
street
market.
justice
david
h.
souter
your
whole
argument
for
triviality,
though,
goes...
your
whole
argument
for
triviality,
though,
goes
back
to
your
disagreement
with
the
government
about
how
many
people
are
involved,
because
i
take
it
you
accept
the
assumption
that
the
more
people
who
are
involved...
if
there
are
millions
and
millions,
it
is
unlikely
that
this
licensed
activity
is
going
to
be
without
an
effect
on
the
market.
so
the
whole
argument
boils
down
to
how
many
people
are
going
to
be
involved.
you
don't
accept
the
government's
100,000-dollar
figure.
let
me
ask
you
a
question
that
would...
that
would
get
to,
maybe,
a
different
number,
and
that
is,
do
you
know
how
many
people
there
are
in
california
who
are
undergoing
chemotherapy
at
any
given
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
number
going
to
be
indicative
of
the
demand
for
marijuana?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you...
if
you
accept
that,
then
there's
nothing
implausible
about
the
government's
hundred-thousand
number,
is
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
many
people
are
there
in
california?
what's
the
population?
justice
david
h.
souter
lots...
lots--
[laughter]
--lots
and
lots.
they...
a
hundred-thousand
cancer
patients
undergoing
chemotherapy
does
not
seem
like
an
implausible
number.
and,
in
fact,
if
that
number
is
a
plausible
one
today,
its
plausibility
reflects,
among
other
things,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
controversy
as
to
whether
california's
law,
in
fact,
is
enforceable,
or
not.
and
the
reason...
there
is
reason
to
assume
that...
if
we
ruled
your
way,
that
that
number
would
go
up.
so,
if
you
accept
that
line
of
argument,
then
your
argument,
that
the
effect,
whatever
it
may
be,
is
going
to
be
trivial,
seems
to
me
unsupportable.
am
i
missing
something?
justice
david
h.
souter
well...
but
that
is
circular
reasoning,
because
the
whole...
your
whole
argument
that
it's
non-economic
is
based
on
the
claim
that
there
are...
the
numbers
are
so
few...
the
number
of
people
involved,
from
what
you
could
generalize,
are
so
few
that
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
infer
an
effect
on
the
market.
if
there
would
be
a
large
market
effect,
it
makes
no
more
sense
to
call
this
non-economic
than
filburn's
use,
non-economic.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
was
inference
upon
inference
upon
inference.
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
your
whole
jurisprudence
in
this
case
is
premised
on
the
assumption
that
we
have
got
to
identify
the
entire
range
of
potential
effect
based
on
the
particular
character
of
two
individuals
in
their...
in
their
supply
of
marijuana.
and
the
whole
point
of
this
argument
is
that
that
does
not
seem
to
be
a
realistic
premise
on
which
to
base
constitutional
law.
