justice
ruth
bader

but,
as
justice
o'connor
brought
out
earlier,
all
those
cases...
wickard,
perez...
they
all
involved
a
commercial
enterprise.
and,
here,
we're
told
this
is
different,
because
nobody
is
buying
anything,
nobody
is
selling
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there
is,
in
this
record,
a
showing
that,
for
at
least
one
of
the
two
plaintiffs,
there
were
some
30-odd
drugs
taken,
none
of
them
worked.
this
was
the
only
one
that
would.
and
it...
justice
souter
asked
you
about
these
two
plaintiffs.
the
law
can't
be
made
on
the
basis
of
those
two
plaintiffs.
but
let's
suppose
that
you're
right,
generally.
if
there
were
to
be
a
prosecution
of
any
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
would
there
be
any
defense,
if
there
were
to
be
a
federal
prosecution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
there--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--have
there
been
any
applications
to
change
the
schedule
for
marijuana
to
the
fda?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
one--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
one
takes
your
view,
that
this
is
non-economic
activity,
so
it's
outside
congress'
commerce
power,
then
explain
to
me
why,
if
you
have
someone
similarly
situated
in
a
neighboring
state,
somebody
whose
doctor
says,
"this
person
needs
marijuana
to
live.
"
but
that
state
doesn't
have
a
compassionate-use
act...
it's
just
as
isolated...
no
purchase,
no
sale,
grown
at
home,
good
friend
grows
it...
and
yet
you
say
congress
could
regulate
that,
if
i
understand
your
brief
properly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you...
if
you
buy
that...
so
your
first
answer
is,
yes,
on
your
first
argument,
it
would
be
equally
impermissible
for
the
feds
to
regulate
medical
use
anywhere.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
now
you're
going
to
have
some
limiting--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yeah,
but
it
doesn't
right
now,
and
that
doesn't
make
the
scheme
less
valid,
in
your
view.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
some
of
the
illnesses--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
one...
in
one
plaintiff's
case,
i
think,
there
isn't
a
life-threatening--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
just
ask
you
one
procedural
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
is...
this
is
a
suit
for
an
injunction.
and
it...
basically
an
injunction
against
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
there's
an
old
saying,
in
equity,
that
courts
don't
enjoin
criminal
prosecutions.
so
how
is
your
injunction
suit
appropriate,
given
that
old
saying
there
that
you
have
to
make
your
defense
in
the
criminal
proceeding
and
not
enjoin
this
operation?
