justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't
understand.
is
there
any
authority
in
the
commerce
cases
for...
an
x,
which
is
there
in
the
middle
of
a
state,
and
it
doesn't
move
one
way
or
the
other...
now,
congress'
power
does
extend
to
the
x
if
the
state
doesn't
say
something
about
the
x.
but
if
the
state
says
something
about
the
x,
then
congress'
power
does
not
extend
to
it.
that's
hard
for
me
to
accept,
because
i
don't
see...
whether
it's
commerce
or
not
commerce,
whether
it
affects
something
or
doesn't
affect
something,
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
have
much
to
do
with
whether
the
state
separately
regulates
it,
and
i
can't
find
any
support
at
all
for
that
in
any
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
here,
they
say...
look,
i
take
it
you're
using
this
because
i
was
going
to
ask
you.
you
know,
he
grows
heroin,
cocaine,
tomatoes
that
are
going
to
have
genomes
in
them
that
could,
at
some
point,
lead
to
tomato
children
that
will
eventually
affect
boston.
you
know,
we
can...
oil
that's
never,
in
fact,
being
used,
but
we
want
an
inventory
of
it,
federally.
you
know,
i
can
multiply
the
examples--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you
can,
too.
so
you're
going
to
get
around
all
those
examples
by
saying
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
now
what
you're
saying
is,
in
a
commerce
clause
case,
what
we're
supposed
to
do
is
to
start
to
look
at
the
federal
scheme
and
the
state
scheme
and
see,
comparing
the
federal
scheme
and
the
state
scheme,
whether,
given
the
state
scheme,
the
federal
scheme
is
really
necessary
to
include
this.
that's
a
task,
and
i'm
trying
to
make
it
as
complicated
as
i
can
in
my
question.
[laughter]
but
i
see
it
very
well.
here
is
what
they
say.
they
say
that,
"by
the
way,
a
hundred-thousand
people
using
medical
marijuana
in
california
will
lead
to
lower
marijuana
prices
in
the
nation.
"
"bad.
"
"and,
second,
when
we
see
medical
marijuana
in
california,
we
won't
know
what
it
is.
"
"everybody'll
say,
"mine
is
medical"."
"certificates
will
circulate
on
the
black
market.
"
"we
face
a
mess.
"
"for
both
those
reasons,
it
does
have
an
impact.
"
they
say.
now,
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
we
don't
want
more
people--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the
illicit
drug
market.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we
don't
want
low
prices,
either.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
normally
i
would
have
said,
it's
up
to
congress
to
figure
out
how
to...
the
way
that...
you
have
one
going
one
way,
one
going
the
other
way,
and
balancing
those
factors
would
be
for
congress.
that's
what
we'd
normally
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
say
all
that
stuff
is
not
for
congress;
that's
for
us.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
it
is,
is,
it's
non-economic,
and
it
affects
the
economic.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
this
is
a
new
framework,
i
take
it,
and
it's
very
interesting.
and
one
of
the
things
that
interests
me...
i
guess,
on
your
framework,
lopez
should
have
come
out
my
way.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
it's
essential
to
regulate
guns
in
schools
as
part
of
a
national
gun-control
regulatory
scheme.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
thought
we
didn't
need
to
reach
all
that
here,
for
the
reason
that
the
connection
here,
which
is
an
enforcement-related
connection
and
a
market-related
connection,
is
actually,
i
have
to
confess,
a
little
more
obvious
and
a
little
more
close
than
what
i
had
to...
what
i
had
to
say
in
lopez
to...
was
the
connection
between
guns,
education,
communities,
and
business.
so
i
would
have
thought,
given
the...
and
i
believe
that,
you
know...
but,
i
mean...
but
that
was
far
further
than
this,
which
is
just
direct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
the
court
said,
i
take
it...
and
i
have
quoted
a
lot
of
the
language
there...
it
says
that
the
wheat
farmer's
consumption
of
home-grown
wheat,
not
the
part
that
went
in...
quote,
"though
it
may
not
be
regarded
as
commerce--
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--end
quote,
still
can
be
regulated,
quote,
"whatever
its
nature",
so
long
as,
quote,
"it
exerts
a
substantial
economic
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
"
now,
that's
the
language,
and
i
take
it
that
justice
scalia
is
exactly
right,
i
thought,
from
that
language,
it's
about
the
analysis,
home-grown
wheat,
which
is
not
economic,
having
an
effect
on
something
that
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
not
commerce.
sorry,
not
commerce.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
commerce
clause
speaks
in
terms
of
commerce.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question
about
the
activity--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
was
brought
up
before,
and
i
just...
i've
never
understood
this.
i'm
not
an
expert.
i
don't
honestly
know,
if
i
really
think
about
it,
despite
all
the
papers
and
so
forth,
whether
it's
true
that
medical
marijuana
is
helpful
to
people
in
ways
that
pills
are
not.
i
really
don't
know.
so
i
would
have
thought
that
the
people,
like
your
clients,
who
have
a
strong
view
about
it,
would
go
to
the
fda,
and
they
would
say
to
the
fda,
"fda,
take
this
off
the
list.
"
"you
must
take
it
off
the
list
if
it
has
an
accepted
medical
use
and
it
isn't
lacking
in
safety.
"
the
fda
will
say
yes
or
it
will
say
no.
if
it
says
yes,
they
win.
if
they
say
no,
they
can
come
right
into
court
and
say,
"that's
an
abuse
of
discretion".
the
court
says
yes
or
no.
if
it
says
no,
it
must
be
because
it
wasn't
an
abuse
of
discretion,
in
which
case,
i,
as
a
judge,
and
probably
as
a
person,
would
think
it
isn't
true
that
marijuana
has
some
kind
of
special
use.
so
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
the
obvious
way
to
get
what
they
want.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
relevant
to
the
correct
characterization.
and
while
the
fda
can
make
mistakes,
i
guess
medicine
by
regulation
is
better
than
medicine
by
referendum.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's...
i
just
want
to
know
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
true,
but
as
long
as
that
hasn't
been
done,
don't
i
have
to
take
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
medical
marijuana
that's
special
and
necessary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
has
been
done,
maybe
i
shouldn't
make
it.
