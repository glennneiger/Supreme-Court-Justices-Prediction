justice
john
paul
stevens
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
ashcroft
against
raich.
general
clement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
general
clement,
what
if
we
were
to
assume...
i'm
not
saying
this
is...
that
the
district
court
could
find
that
there
is
a
narrow
segment
of
the
market
in
which
they
could
prevent
diversions,
and
they
had...
say
they
made
such
findings.
would
we
have
to
disregard
them,
or
say
they
were
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
why
do
you
need
to
rely
on
the
possibility
of
diversion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
in
my
hypothesis,
it's
a
nonexistent
reality.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
applying
it
to
the
opposite
kind
of
regulatory...
you're
applying
it
to
a
regulatory
regime
in
which
the
government
wants
to
prohibit
this
subject...
substances
from
being
sold
or...
in
interstate
commerce.
and
if
you
just
follow
the
litter...
the
letter
of
this
law,
this
marijuana
won't
get
into
interstate
commerce.
in
fact,
it
would
reduce
the
demand
for
marijuana,
because
it
would
supply
these
local
users
and
they
wouldn't
have
to
go
into
the
interstate
market.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
to
the
extent
that
this
statute
has
any
impact,
it
will
reduce
the
purchase
in
the
interstate
market
and
confine
these
to
locally
grown
marijuana.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
i'm
assuming...
my
hypothetical
is
that
california
could
pass
a
law
that
would
prevent
diversions
from
occurring.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
think--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--doesn't
it
depend
on
how
you
define
the
"relevant
class
of
activities"?
is
it
the
entire
class
that
congress
ought
to
regulate,
or
is
it
a
narrower
class,
in
which
the
plaintiffs
contend
that
the
statute
cannot
constitutionally
be
applied
to
a
particular
very
narrowly
defined
class?
and
is
it
ever
permissible
to
define
the
class
narrowly
to
escape
a...
the
broad
argument
that
you
make?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying
that
this
statute
could
never
have
an
unconstitutional
application.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
statute
is...
it
trumps
the
independent
judgement
of
the
physicians
who
prescribe
it
for
the
patients
at
issue
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there
could
be
any
state
of
facts
on
which
a
judicial
tribunal
could
disagree
with
the
finding
of
congress
that
there's
no
acceptable
medical
use?
say
they
had
a...
say
there
was
a
judicial
hearing
on
which
they
made
a
contrary
finding.
would
we
have
to
ignore
that?
would
we
have
to
follow
the
congressional
finding
or
the
judicial
finding
if
that
happened?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnett?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question.
what
is
your
view
with
respect
to
the
impact
of
the
activities
concerned
in
this
case
on
the
interstate
market
for
marijuana?
is
it
your
view
that
it
will
have
no
impact,
that
it
will
increase
the
interstate
demand,
or
decrease
the
interstate
demand?
so
there
are
three
alternatives.
which
is
the
one
we
should
follow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
it...
"trivial
impact",
is
it
a
trivial
impact
that
enhances
the
price
of
marijuana
or
decreases
the
price
of
marijuana,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
would
reduce
demand
and
increase
price,
it
seems
to
me.
it's
the
other
way
around.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
reduce
demand,
you
reduce
prices?
are
you
sure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
you're
right.
you're
right.
okay.
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
barnett.
general
clement,
you
have
four
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
general
clement.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
california
is
one
of
at
least
nine
states
that
authorize
the
use
of
marijuana
for
medicinal
purposes.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
power
vested
in
congress
by
article
i,
section
8
of
the
constitution
to
make
all
laws
which
shall
be
necessary
and
proper
for
carrying
into
execution
its
authority
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
includes
the
power
to
prohibit
the
local
cultivation
and
use
of
marijuana
in
compliance
with
california
law.
respondents
are
seriously
ill
california
residents.
their
doctors
have
concluded
after
unsuccessfully
prescribing
a
host
of
conventional
medicines
that
marijuana
is
the
only
drug
available
that
provides
effective
treatment.
both
women
have
been
using
marijuana
as
a
medication
for
several
years
pursuant
to
their
doctors’
recommendation,
and
both
rely
heavily
on
cannabis
to
function
on
a
daily
basis.
while
respondents’
activities
do
not
violate
california
law,
they
do
violate
the
federal
controlled
substance
act
of
1970,
a
comprehensive
regulatory
statute
which,
among
other
things,
categorically
prohibits
the
manufacture,
distribution,
or
possession
of
marijuana
for
any
purpose.
after
agents
from
the
drug
enforcement
administration
seized
and
destroyed
their
cannabis
plants,
respondents
filed
this
action
to
prohibit
enforcement
of
the
federal
statute
to
the
extent
that
it
prevents
them
from
cultivating
marijuana
for
their
personal
medical
use.
the
district
court
denied
relief,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
as
applied
to
their
activities,
the
csa
exceeded
congress
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
because
of
the
obvious
importance
of
the
case,
we
granted
certiorari.
the
case
is
extremely
troublesome
because
respondents
have
made
such
a
strong
showing
that
they
will
suffer
irreparable
harm
if
denied
the
use
of
marijuana
to
treat
their
serious
medical
illness.
but
the
question
before
us
is
not
whether
marijuana
does
in
fact
have
valid
therapeutic
purposes,
nor
whether
it
is
a
good
policy
for
the
federal
government
to
enforce
the
controlled
substances
act
in
these
circumstances.
rather,
the
only
question
before
us
is
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
prohibit
respondents’
activities.
california
law
does
not
really
affect
our
answer
to
that
question
for
it
is
well-settled
that
the
outer
limits
of
congressional
power
under
the
commerce
clause
are
defined
exclusively
by
federal
law.
the
supremacy
clause
unambiguously
provides
that
if
there
is
any
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law,
federal
law
shall
prevail.
the
federal
power
can
neither
be
enlarged
nor
diminished
by
the
exercise
or
non-exercise
of
state
power.
our
case
law
firmly
establishes
that
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
purely
local
activities
when
necessary
to
implement
a
comprehensive
national
regulatory
program.
neither
the
fact
that
respondents
used
locally
grown
marijuana
for
medicinal
rather
than
recreational
purposes,
nor
the
fact
that
their
use
for
such
purposes
is
permitted
by
california
law,
justifies
a
constitutionally-compelled
exemption
from
the
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme
created
by
the
controlled
substances
act.
for
the
reason
stated
at
length
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
have
joined
except
for
part
three
of,
and
justice
thomas
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
