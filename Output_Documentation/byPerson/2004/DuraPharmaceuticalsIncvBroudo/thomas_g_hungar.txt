mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
a
fraud-on-the-market
case,
a
plaintiff
who
buys
a
security
at
an
inflated
price
suffers
no
loss
at
the
time
of
purchase
because
the
market
continues
to
value
the
security
at
the
inflated
price,
and
that's--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
our
view...
well,
what
ought
to
happen
in
this
case
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
because
the
court
failed
to
require
loss
causation.
in
effect,
what
the
court
said
is
that
transaction
causation
is
sufficient.
but
what--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
accurately
tell
you
petitioners'
position,
but
i
can
tell
you
our
position,
which
is
that
in
a
fraud-on-the-market
case
the
plaintiff
cannot...
has
failed
to
plead
loss
causation
unless
the
plaintiff
pleads
that
the...
the
inflation
attributable
to
the
misrepresentation
or
omission
has
been
removed
or
reduced
from
the
price
of
the
stock
through
dissemination
of
corrective
information
of
some
sort
to
the
market.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
company
must
make
an
announcement
or
that
there
must
be
an
admission
of
fraud
or
that
there
must
be
really
any
information,
any...
any
sort
of
formal
disclosure.
but
if
the
information
is
disseminated
to
the
market
such
that
the
market,
in
whole
or
in
part,
becomes
aware
of
the
truth
and
adjusts
the
price
accordingly,
that
price
adjustment
is
loss
and
the
plaintiff
has
alleged
loss
causation
in
an
amount
to
be
proven
at
trial.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
right.
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
the...
i
don't
think
the
question...
we
cited
rule
9(b)
in
our
brief
because
fraud
must
be
pled
with
particularity
and...
and
that...
and
that
rule
applies
to
all
the,
quote,
circumstances
constituting
a
fraud.
but
the
court
doesn't
need
to
address
the
question
because
even
under
rule
8,
the
plaintiff
must
allege
all
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct.
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
we
think
9(b)
applies
here.
obviously,
this
is
a
fraud
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
congress
has
made
very
clear
that
loss
causation
is
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action.
the
elements
must
be
pled.
in
a
fraud
case,
they
must
be
pled
with
particularity,
but
even...
even
in
a...
in
a
common
law--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
with
respect,
your
honor,
we
think
circumstances...
it
does
not
constitute
fraud
if
there
is
no
loss
causation.
at
least
it
certainly
doesn't
constitute
securities
fraud
under
this
statute,
and
if
the
complaint
does
not
plead
loss
causation,
it
hasn't
pled
fraud.
so
we
submit
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
but
in
a...
in
a
private
action
for
securities
fraud,
loss
causation
is
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action.
it's
not
an
element
in
every
fraud
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it
may
be
a
semantic
question.
that's--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--but
there...
i
mean,
there
are
cases
in
the...
in
the
courts
of
appeals
saying
that...
that
rule
9(b)
applies
to
all
the
elements,
and
we're
not
aware
of
cases...
the...
the...
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
cites
cases
which
focus
on
the
nature
of
the
representation,
and
that's
certainly
where
9(b)
issues
are
generally
fought
out
because
in
a...
in
a
typical
securities
case,
loss
causation
is
not
a
difficult
issue
because
the...
the
bad
news
is...
is
announced,
the
stock
drops,
and
the
plaintiff
pleads
loss
causation
as
a
matter
of
course.
it...
it's...
it's
not
a
difficult
burden
to
satisfy
in
your
run-of-the-mill
securities
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
as
a...
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
there's
a
huge
difference
in
how
these
cases
are
litigated
because
it's
the
difference
between
spending
millions
of
dollars
on
discovery,
literally
millions
of
dollars
on
discovery,
or
not.
if...
if
the
plaintiff
has
failed
to
allege
loss
causation
and
for
some
reason
feels
unable
to
allege
it,
the...
the
case
is
going
to
be
dismissed.
if
the
court
doesn't
require
loss
causation,
as
the
ninth
circuit
did...
did
here,
that
means
the
case
is
going
to
go
to
discovery
and
the
defendant
is
going
to
have
to
either
spend
millions
of
dollars
on
their
own
lawyers
or
spend
millions
of
dollars
to
settle
even
in
a
case
that...
where
the
plaintiff
might
be
unable
to
establish
loss
causation.
that's
why--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--congress
did
what
it
did
in
1995.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
think
that's...
that's
a
helpful
way
to
look
at
it,
justice
souter,
because
it's...
in...
in
a
fraud-on-the-market
case,
by
definition
the
plaintiff
is
alleging
that
there
was
an
efficient
national
market
and
that
is
what
makes
the
difference.
if
this
were
the...
you...
you
buy
a
gold
mine,
like
the...
the
old
common
law
cases
that
respondents
cite,
there's
no
efficient
national
market
on
which
the...
the
plaintiff
can
turn
around
and
sell
it
at
the
same
price
until
the
information
has
been
disclosed.
but
when
it
is
an...
a
national,
active
stock
market,
the
market
continues
to
reflect
the
inflation,
and
so...
so
the
plaintiff
has
not
been
injured,
and
the
allegation
that
it
was
an
efficient
market
and
i
bought
it
at
an
inflated
price
does
not
support
an
inference
of...
of
injury.
and
the...
and
so
because
it
is
a
fraud-on-the-market
case,
that's
exactly
right.
the
additional
information
must
be
pled
in
the
complaint
or
else
no
injury
has
been...
been
pled
and
the
complaint
must
be
dismissed.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
you're
referring
to
section
12(b)
or?
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
suppose
a
plaintiff
in--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
think
what
that
encompasses
is
a...
is
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
purchased
the
stock
on
the
market...
on...
on
a
open
market,
which
will
typically
be
in
practice
a
fraud-on-the-market
case.
i
suppose
a
plaintiff,
in
an
unusual
case,
might
not
allege...
might
not
choose
to
plead
it
as
fraud-on-the-market
case
if
they
have
some
specific
evidence
or
reliance
that
they
view
is
stronger,
but--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
i
think
they...
they
unquestionably
are
trying
to
establish
their
damages.
the
ninth
circuit's
damage
theory
or...
or
injury
theory
establishes
damages
by
reference
to
the
market
price.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
plaintiffs
alleged
they
purchased
at
the
market
price
in
this
fraud-on-the-market
case,
and...
and
the
damages
are
the
difference
between
what
they
paid
at
that
market
price
and
what
it
should
have
been.
that
is
in
our
view
an
attempt
to
establish
damages
by
reference.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
they...
they
alleged
they
purchased
on
the
market.
if...
if
they
weren't
purchasing
on
the
market--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
in
any
event,
we
interpret
it
to
refer
to...
i
mean,
by
definition
they
are,
in
a
fraud-on-the-market
case,
alleging
that
they
have
purchased
at
the
market
price,
and
that's
exactly
what
this
statute
would
be
encompassing.
but
beyond
that,
as...
as
mr.
sullivan
identified,
congress'
explanation
of
how
it
understood
loss
causation,
when
it...
when
it
enacted
section
12(b)
as
part
of
the
reform
act,
is
entirely
consistent
with
our
position,
and
the
common
law
is
entirely
consistent
with
our
position.
thank
you.
