h.

well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is...
is
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
the
reason...
is
there
a
further
reason
that
they've
got
to...
to
plead
loss
causation?
and
that
is,
by
reading
(e)(2),
in
effect,
as...
as
making...
as...
as
saying
that
if
you
were
going
to
recover
on
a
fraud-on-the-market
theory,
you
in
effect
have...
have
got
to
prove
your
loss
in
a
certain
way.
and
you're
saying
if
you're
going
to...
if
you're
going
to
sue
on
a
fraud-on-the-market
theory,
you've
got
to
allege
all
the
elements
of
fraud
on
the
market.
and
if
you
allege
all
the
elements
of
fraud
on
the
market,
you're
going
to
allege
exactly
what
you've
just
been
saying
is
required.
so
it's
not
so
the...
i...
i
guess
what
i'm...
i'm
getting
at
is
maybe
what...
maybe
the
nub
of
the
answer
is
not
necessarily
that
there's...
that
there's
fraud
involved,
but
there
is
a
fraud-on-the-market
theory
as
the
basis
for
the
cause
of
action,
and
if
that
is
the
basis,
it's
got
to
be
disclosed
in
the
pleadings
as
an
element.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you...
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
phrase
in
(e)(2),
if
the
plaintiff...
i'm
sorry.
let
me
find
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i'm
trying
to
find
a
phrase
in
(e)(2).
if
the
plaintiff
seeks
to
establish
damages
by
reference
to
the
market
price
of
a
security,
do
you
take
that
phrase
as...
as
referring
to
a
fraud-on-the-market
theory
or
as
being
broader
than
a
fraud-on-the...
on-the-market
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
certainly
includes
it.
there's
no
question
about
that.
does--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if...
if
it's
not
confined
to
fraud-on-the-market,
then
there's
the
argument
on
the
other
side
that
all...
all
(2)
is
really
doing
is
saying
that
if
you
are
going
to
establish
your
damages
by
reference
to
market
price,
this
is
the
way
you've
got
to
do
it.
you've
got
to
go
through
this
mean
price
analysis
and
so
on.
but
they
are
saying
we
are
not
simply
trying
to
establish
our
damages
by
reference
to
the
market,
and
therefore
we're
not
bound
by...
and
therefore,
(e)(2),
in
effect,
is...
is
irrelevant.
what...
what
is
your
answer--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
the...
to
the
purchase
price.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
if
you've
got
to
show
the
inflation,
then
you
don't
have
a
complete
cause
of
action
the
day
after
you
buy
the
stock
if
there's
no
loss.
i
mean,
if
you've
got
to
show
the...
the
drop
following
the
inflation,
you
don't
have
the
complete
cause
of
action
if
there's
no
drop
the
day
after
you
buy
the
stock.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i...
i
thought
you
were
conceding
that
you...
you,
in
fact,
do
not
have
a...
a
loss...
forget
what
you
can
recover...
that
you
don't
have
a
loss
until
the
inflation
is
followed
by
a
drop.
and
if
there's
no
drop
at
the...
at
time
of
purchase
plus
1
minute,
then
i
don't
see
how
there
is
even
the
element
of
a
cause
of
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you're
talking
about
a
cause
of
action
without
damages.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
have
no
damages,
you
have
no
cause...
i
mean,
on
normal
tort
theory,
you
have
no
cause
of
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
what...
it
seems
to
me
that
what
judge
sneed's
theory
boils
down
to
is
this.
you
cannot
recover
any
loss
except
the
loss
that
was
caused
by
the
fraud
in
question.
in
theory,
that
limit
is
established
by
the
inflation
at
the
time
you
purchase.
so
that
is
the
limit
of
your
recovery,
but
it
does
not
follow
from
that
that
you
have
anything
to
recover
for
until
you
have
your
actual
loss
if
you're
pleading
a...
a
fraud-on-the-market
theory.
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
let's
approach
it
a
different
way.
on
a
fraud-on-the-market
theory,
there
are
two
facts
i
think
that
can
be
assumed.
number
one,
there
was
no
misrepresentation
that
was
made
peculiarly
to
you.
the
misrepresentation
was
to
the
broad
market
and
was
reflected
in
the
broad
market
price.
justice
david
h.
souter
number
two,
you
as
a
purchaser
do
not
know
about
the
fraud
until
the
market
finds
out
about
the
fraud.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is
the
case,
then
i
don't
see
that
it
makes
any
sense
at
all
to
talk
about
your
having
a
cause
of
action
the
day
after
you
purchase
before
the
market
has
found
out
and
before
the
fraud
is
known.
i
mean,
this...
this
strikes
me
as
an
exercise
in...
in
an
inconsistent
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
aren't...
aren't
you...
aren't
you,
in...
in
effect,
equating
two
different
things:
one,
a
loss
that
you
suffer
which
you
say
occurs
immediately
upon
purchase
of
the
inflated
stock;
and
on
the
other
hand,
a
limit
on
the
loss
that
is
attributable
to
the
fraud?
those
are
two
different
things.
i
understand
the
limit
on
the
loss.
i
don't
understand
the...
the
suffering
of
the
loss
in
fact.
