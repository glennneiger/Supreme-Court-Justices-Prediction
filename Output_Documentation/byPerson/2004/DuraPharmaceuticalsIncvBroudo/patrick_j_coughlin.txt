mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
justice
stevens,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
yes,
that's
what...
exactly
what
we
would
do.
we
would
go
back
and
replead,
if
we
were
required
to
do
that,
with
more
specificity.
we
don't
think
that
(9)(b)
applies
in
this
situation
because
both
the
eleventh
and
the
third
circuits
have
held
that
(9)(b)
only
applies
to
the
circumstances
constituting
fraud.
it
has
never
been
applied
to
materiality,
loss
causation,
or
damages.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
i
don't
think
that's
so
hard
to
do.
and
you're
right.
we
have
to
plead
the
theory,
and...
and
the
theory
is--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--and...
and
you're
right,
your
honor.
there's
not
much
in
here.
we
plead
the
rises.
there
are
approximately
seven
rises.
we
plead
the
purchases.
we
plead
the
big
drop.
do
we
plead
with
specificity?
the...
the
losses
as
to
alspiros?
no.
we
could
have
done
a
better
job.
under
the
ninth
circuit,
though,
the
law,
as
we
pled
it
at
the
time,
was
that
we
have
to
plead
an
inflation
and
identify
the
causes.
and
that's
what
we
did
under
ninth
circuit
law.
if
this
court
were
to
decide
that
we
had
to
do
more,
could
we?
certainly.
i
mean,
we
have
some
of
the
information
in
there.
we...
we
tie
alspiros
to
the
sales
force,
which
is
an
announcement
on
2/24.
you
know,
there's
a
lack
of
integrity
in
management.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
enough
to
prove
that
we
just
paid
an
overinflated
price.
you
cannot
recover
under
ninth
circuit
law
unless
you
not
only
prove
that
you
paid
an
inflated
price,
but
also
that
you
prove
that
inflation
came
out.
i
think
where
we
differ
from
the
government
and
petitioners
is
that
it...
conceptually,
at
least
with
the
government,
the
right
framework
is
to
analyze
did
the
inflation
come
out
of
the
stock.
and
our
quarrel
here
is
how
can
the
inflation
come
out
of
the
stock?
does
there
have
to
be
a
corrective
disclosure?
and
we
say
no.
time
itself
can
take
inflation
out
of
the
stock.
company-specific
information
is
our
biggest
concern.
if
somebody
walks
a
stock
down,
so
to
speak,
they
give
out
information
lowering
expectations
because
stock
prices
are
based
on
cash
flow.
if
they
walk
it
down
and
say,
hey,
our...
we're
going
to
have
a
revenue
miss,
but
they
don't
announce
their
problems
with
alspiros
at
the
time,
or
we're
closing
some
factories,
or
we're
taking
a
significant
write-off,
that
stock
drops.
we
believe
that
lowers
inflation.
i
think
a
good
case
to
take
a
look
at
to
illustrate
this
is
the
wool
v.
tandem
case
out
of
the
ninth
circuit.
in
that
case,
tandem
was
shipping
to
its
own
warehouses
for
2
years,
lying
about
its
revenues.
wool
went
out
and
bought
the
stock.
the
stock
was
inflated.
the
wall
street
journal,
subsequent
to
that,
reported
we
don't
see
how
tandem
can
continue
to
book
these
revenues,
and
then
the
company
itself
lowered
expectations
in
one
of
their
sec
filings
saying,
hey,
lower
than
expected
revenues
coming
up.
the
stock
has
dropped
and
now
wool
sells.
and
now
then
after
that,
it's
admitted
that
there
was
a
fraud.
does...
and
the
stock
barely
drops
hardly
at
all
because
the
expectations
in
that
stock
have
already
been
taken
out.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
maybe
and
maybe
not
much.
it
depends
on
what's
your
cash
in
the
bank.
in
this
case,
they
had
gone
to
the
market
and
gotten
$400
million
of
cash
in
the
bank.
so
as
the
expectations
were
lowered
with
the
ceclor
cd
sales
here
not
once
but
twice
and
the
sales
force
inadequacy,
before
it
was
ever
announced,
they
knew
when
the
fda
was
coming
out.
this
is
not
the
perfect
situation.
you're
right.
we
could
have
just
taken
this
out
and--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--there's
no
doubt,
your
honor.
and
if
we
have
to
do
it
at
the
pleading
stage,
it
would
be
impossible.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
and...
and
i
think
we
did
that.
we
said
the
stock
was
inflated
and
there
was
damage,
and
we
could
have
done
a
better
job.
absolutely--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--that's
absolutely
correct.
we
believe
that
you
suffer
your
loss
and
damages
on
the
date
you
make
the
purchase.
on
the
day--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--would
not
allow
recovery
in
that--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--because
those--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--justice
scalia,
because
those
are...
what
we're
talking
about
are
recoverable
damages,
and
then
there's
a
limitation
from
section
28.
in
other
words,
all
the
cause
of
action
was
satisfied
on
the
date
you
overpay.
the
day
you
pay
$100
for
a
stock
that's
worth
$50,
you're
out
the
$50,
the
economy
is
out
the
$50
because
it's
not
working
market.
but
you
cannot
recover,
we
would
agree,
until
later.
and
the
problem
with
analyzing
that
at
the
pleading
stage
is
that
is
the...
that
is
expert
analysis
and
discovery
to
connect
up
how...
how
the
losses
came
out
and
what
you
can
recover.
so
i
agree
with
you
that
you
cannot
recover
that.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
well,
that's--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--it
doesn't
matter
for
that
plaintiff
if
they
sell
it
to
a
poor...
somebody
unexpected.
for
example,
fannie
mae
just
publicly,
a
couple
of
weeks
ago,
found
out
they
bought
$300
million
worth
of
bonds,
and
they...
they
found
out
about
a
fraud.
they
sold
it
and
got
fined
by
the
government
because
they
heard
about
the
fraud
and
sold
it
back
into
the
market
to
recoup
their
losses
or
back
through
their
broker.
that's...
that's
not
okay.
that's
just
one
outrageous
example.
but
somebody
ends
up
with
that
stock
that's
inflated.
okay?
and
when
you
make
the
purchase.
we
agree
we
have
to
show
the
inflation
come
out
before
recovery,
and...
and
90
percent
of
the
time--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--the
inflation
came
out
of
the
stock.
in
other
words,
if
you
pay
$100
for
a
stock
that's
worth
$50,
it's
inflated
by
$50.
you
don't
recover
that
$50
until
you
show
that
$50
inflation
came
out
of
the
stock.
it
can
come
out
a
number
of
ways.
let's
say,
for
example,
that
somebody
announced
a
competitive
product.
well,
that
would
take
some
of
the
inflation.
that
would
be
a
market
factor
that
would
take
some
of
the
inflation
out
of
your
false
statement
that
you
had
a
product,
the
alspiros
product.
there
are
different
ways
inflation
can
come
out
besides
a
corrective
disclosure.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
you
can
only
recover--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--you
can
only
recover
if
that
inflation
is
taken
out
of
the
stock.
those
are
recoverable
damages
under
ninth
circuit
law.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
i...
i
believe
that
the
day
you
overpay
something,
just
like
in
the
sigafus,
just
in
the...
in
the
bolles
case,
both
of
them
had
to
do
with
gold
mines--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--you
may
not
have
recoverable
damages.
that
is
true.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
i
understand,
and
i
think
you
have
$50
worth
of
damages
right
there.
and
our
concern
is
what
you
have
to
prove--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--in
the
most
complex
frauds,
a...
a
company
is
reporting
revenue
and
earnings
and
their
stock
is,
let's
say,
trading
at
$60
a
share.
perhaps,
because
of
fraud,
it's
overstated
by
$30.
there
are
people
in
the
market
buying
that
stock
at
$60.
that
company
starts
to
lower
those
expectations.
this
happens
to
be
a
real
world
example,
worldcom.
they
say
we're
going
to
miss
revenues
by
$172
million.
the
stock
starts
dropping
down.
the
inflation
that
was
in
that
stock
because
of
what
they
lied
about
starts
coming
out.
nobody
knows
there's
fraud.
nobody
understands
that.
in
fact,
it's
not
until
that
stock
goes
down
at
80
cents
that
there
was
an
admission
of
fraud.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
i
certainly
don't
want
to
be
disagreeing
with
judge
posner.
so
i--
[laughter]
the
other--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
that's
just...
we
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
we
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
we
have
to
prove
that
that
inflation
was
in
there
when
we
prove
it.
and
what
we're
talking
about
is
what
the
burden
is
going
to
be
on
us
at
the
pleading,
and
that's
what
we're
concerned
about.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
government
says
that
we
can
recover.
we
believe
that
we
could
recover.
in
other
words,
it
didn't
go
up
as
high.
i
think
it
is...
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
it's
the
same
difference.
you
lost
$50
whether
you
lost
it--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--right.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
well,
i
dream
to
have
those
clients
that
gain
four
times,
but
since
we
don't
usually
have
those
and
it
is
the
drops
that
we're
really
talking
about.
the
but-for
transaction,
when
they
say,
hey,
and...
and
you
buy
it,
and
then
it
goes
up,
and
then
you
learn
about
the
fraud...
and
i'm
assuming
that
there's
no
drop
but
you
can
prove
that
the
inflation
was
there
and
never
came
out,
and
can
you
prove
that
it
should
have
gone
to
$250?
you
know?
i'd
have
to
prove
that
it
went
to
$250.
i
agree
with
you.
you
know,
i
would
agree
with
you
that,
you
know,
that
i'd
get
an
expert.
mr.
fischel
would
come
in
and
testify
that
it
should
have
been
worth
$250.
and
that's
what,
you
know,
would
happen.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
alspiros.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
if...
if
we
move
to
the
proof
stage,
the
people
that
purchased
in
the
class
period
and
sold
before
that
announcement
will
not
be
able
to
recover
that
20
cent
drop
at
the
end.
people
who
purchased
during
the
class
period
and
held
until
all
of
the
inflation
was
taken
out
by
either
final
announcement
from
the
fda
or
when
they
announced
they
were
abandoning
the
product
would
be
able
to
recover
from
that
inflation
because
all
of
the
inflation
was
taken
out
as
to
alspiros.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
product,
ceclor?
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
there...
there
are
some
things
in
that
drop
attributable
to
the
other
product.
the
sales
force
insufficiency,
as
well
as
management
integrity,
and
there
are
some
other
things
that
weren't
pleaded
well.
first
of
all,
we
were
being
conservative
when
we
pled
this
and
we
pled
the
rises.
we
pled
the
insider
sales.
we
pled
the
stock
offerings.
and
all
the
statements
were
in
that
earlier
period.
they
make
the
announcement.
the
stock
starts
down,
50
percent
drop.
it's
walked
down
another
40
percent
after
that.
finally,
you
get
the
fda
announcement.
and
we
certainly
could
have,
and...
and
maybe
should
have,
taken
that
period
out
right
then.
the
district
court
ended
up
having
problems
with
it.
the
ninth
circuit,
in
their
questionings...
judge
reinhardt
had
problems
with
the...
with
that.
and
they
gave
us
leave
to
replead,
and
we
told
them
at
that
time
if
that's
what
we
need
to
do,
is
tie
that
in
also,
if
that's
a
loss
that
we
intend
to
recover
for
or
seek
recovery
for,
then
we'll
do
that
and
we'll
go
back
to
replead.
if
there
are
statute
of
limitations,
that's
a
different
issue,
but
we
can
plead
that
and
could
have.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
i
wish
that
the
circuit
said
if
the
bad
news
came
out,
but
the
koger
case
and...
and
emergent
out
of
the
second
circuit
seem
a
little
stronger
and
talk
about
almost
the
only
way
it
can
happen
is
with
a
corrective
disclosure.
and
that's...
and
that's
a
concern
of
ours.
the
ninth
circuit
law
is
pretty
clear,
is
very
clear
actually,
with
the
three
cases,
blackie,
green,
judge
sneed
in
the
green
v.
occidental
case,
and
the
wool
case,
saying
that
the
loss
occurs
at
the
time
of
purchase
and
overpayment,
but
recoverable
damages--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--that...
it...
it...
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
i'm
hoping
that
it's
not
clearly
wrong.
it's
been
on
the
books
for
30
years.
it
was
the
law.
it
was
the
law
on
the
books
at
the
time
that
this
was
codified.
there
was
no
real
or
perceived
conflict
in
the
circuits
at
the
time
this
was
codified.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
the
ninth
circuit
didn't...
it
cited...
it
cited
the
green
v.
occidental
opinion
and
the
blackie
i
believe.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
i...
i
think
it...
i
think
it--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--there
are
all
the
appendants.
there's...
there's
the
three
that
started
off.
knapp
is
the
atv
case
that
we
tried,
and
that
was
judge
wallace
and
he
relied
on
gray.
all
of
them
are
the
same
in
that
you
have
to...
to
get
by
the
pleading
stage,
that
you
have
to
plead
the
inflation
and
identify
the
causes
for
it.
it's
for
proof
and
expert
testimony
and
discovery
to
see
if
you
have
recoverable
damages.
if
this
court
were
to
say,
no,
we
want
identifiable
drops,
then
we
could
do
that.
you
know,
if
this
court
were
to
say,
listen,
you've
got
to
identify
the
drops,
whether
they...
whether
you
can
connect
them
up
to
the
fraud
at
this
time,
we
want
a
full
theory
in
the
complaint...
and
we
can
do
that.
if
that's
what
the...
if
that's
what
this
court
directs
us
to
do,
then
we'll
do
that
and
we'll
put
in
all
the
losses,
as
well
as
the
rises,
as
well
as
identifying
the
causes.
you
know,
we'll
do
that
in...
in
the
complaints.
sometimes
what...
what
we're
saying
and
where
we
differ
a
little
bit
from
the
government
is
it's
hard
to
necessarily
tie
one
of
those
innocuous
disclosures
that
may
be
taking
the
inflation
out
back
to
the
misrepresentation,
and
yet
the
stock
is
dropping
and
inflation
is
coming
out.
and
that's
what
we're
worried
about.
and
there
are
other
market
forces
that
may
take
it
out.
so
at
the
pleading
stage,
we're
worried
about
the
burden
that
almost
puts
us
in...
in
the
position
of
having
an
expert
come
in,
and
we
think
that's
for
a
later
time
for
summary
judgment
or
trial.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
i
don't
think
i
said--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--i
don't
think
i
said
that
that
was
difficult
or
hard
to
prove.
i
said
it
was
difficult
or
hard
to
plead.
it
is
difficult
and
hard
to
plead,
and...
and
to
tie
that...
those
inflationary
things
back
up
because
you
only
get
to
recover...
you
only
get
to
recover
for
things
that
took
the
inflation
out.
i
mean,
if
the
stock
drops...
let's
say...
let's
say
the
stock
drops
$60
or
$50,
and
where
he
paid
$60,
it
drops
down
to
$10.
but
half
of
that...
half
of
that
drop
is
unrelated
to
the
fraud
absolutely.
well,
under
a
10(b)
cause
of
action,
you
don't
get
to
recover
for
that
market
loss.
we
have
to
tie...
that's
why
judge
sneed
in
occidental...
in
green
v.
occidental
tied
it
right
to
the
overpayment
because
judge
sneed
was
worried
about...
about
the
issuers
being
insurers
for
the
market.
in
other
words,
if
the
stock...
if...
if
a
down
market
takes
the
stock
way
past
what
you
paid
over
inflation,
defendants
should
not
be
liable
for
the
whole
market
loss
as
they
might
in
a
section
33
case.
and
that's
really
what
the...
what
the
point
is,
to
fix
the
loss.
that's
why
judge
sneed
fixed
the
loss
at
the
date
of
overpayment
because
judge
sneed
didn't
want
somebody
coming
in
and
saying,
hey,
you
paid
$60
for
a
stock
that
was
really
worth
$30.
when
you
brought
suit,
the
stock
was
down
at
$10.
do
you
get
to
pay...
do
you
get
$50?
and
judge
sneed
said
no.
you
only
get
the
overpayment
on
the
date.
admittedly
in
up
or
down
markets,
what
petitioners
and
the
government
would
suggest
might
move
the
damages
up
or
down.
in
an
up
market...
you
know,
we're
talking
about
something
that
was
going
down
here.
in
an
up
market,
you
might
get
a
bigger
drop.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
justice
o'connor,
i...
i
couldn't
agree
more,
and
that's
why
it
goes
to
proof.
it
says
this
is
a
proof
statute--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--i
agree.
it
has
to
be
alleged.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
there's
no
doubt.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
they
don't
do
well
enough
in
this
case.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
that's
fair
to
say.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
that
is...
that's
exactly
what...
that's
exactly
what
judge
sneed
did.
and
when
we
were
talking
about
this
statute
here,
it
talks
about
us
proving
those...
that
loss
causation
and
tying
it
to
the
actual
omissions.
and
it
follows
two
sections
that
deal
with
pleading,
material...
deal
with
particularized
pleading
as
to
falsity
and
as
to
scienter.
and
this
statute
says
that
if
you
don't
plead
one
or
two
with
the
particularity
required,
then
the
complaint
shall
be
dismissed.
this
section
here--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--it's
the
limit
on
your
loss.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
no.
i
apologize
if
i
haven't
been
clear.
the
loss
occurs
at
the
time
you
purchase,
but
you
cannot
recover
any
portion
of
the
loss
until
the
inflation
is
taken
out.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
correct.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
and
here's
why
it
matters,
if
i
might,
is
that
what
petitioners
and
perhaps
the
government
would
say
is
that
you're
right.
you
don't
find
out
about
the
fraud
until
the
whole
market
finds
out.
but
before
you
find
out
about
the
fraud,
there
can
be
terrific
drops
in
the
stock,
which
we
think
we
could
prove
are
related
to
the
fraud.
okay?
because
we've
had
certainly
a
market
loss
to
what
we
paid.
the
stock
has
dropped
down.
we
don't
know
about
fraud
yet.
all
of
a
sudden,
there's
a
disclosure
of
fraud,
and
we
all
learn
about
it.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
you
can
lower
expectations
by
lower
revenue
numbers.
other
market
forces
like
a
competitor
coming
out
with
a
product.
there
are
other
things
that
can
lower
that.
i'm
sorry.
and
when
it
gets
down
there,
the
rule
that
we
fear
is
being
urged
is
that
you
only
get
the
drop
from
either
the
admission
of
the
fraud
or
the
full
disclosure
of
the
fraud,
and
in
the
complex
cases,
the
enrons,
the
worldcoms,
the
healthsouths
of
the
world,
that
didn't
happen
even
until
long
after
they
were
in
bankruptcy.
and
if
we
only
get
the
drop,
the
$3
drop
at
the
end,
or
the
80
cents
to
50
cents
that
the
government
just
returned
$750
million
to
in
the
worldcom,
with
every
large
institution
in
the
country
already
out
of
that
stock,
well,
then
those
that
were
sought
to
be
protected
by
the
reform
act
aren't.
we
have
to
be
able
to
plead
certainly...
and...
and
we
can...
the...
the
market
moving
down.
and
then
that's
at
the
pleading
stage,
a
plain
8(a)
statement.
and
then
we
have
to
prove
and
tie
that
back
up
to
get
damages.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
i...
i
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
you
suffer
the
loss
of
overpayment.
you
have
something
in
your
hand
that's
worth
half
as
much
as
its
true
value.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
can
you
recover?
is
it
like
the
ucc
where
you've
got
to
mitigate
your
damages?
you
cannot
recover
those
damages
even
though
you've
suffered
them.
you
have
a
stock
certificate
that's
worth
half
of
what
it's
worth
even
in
an
efficient
market.
and
when
the
truth
comes
out,
that's
true,
you'll
be
damaged,
and
if
you
sell
it
before
then,
you
get
no
recovery.
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's
an
interesting
statement
because
if
the
limit
is...
let's
say
for
a
$100
stock
that's
worth
$50
and
you
overpay
by
$50,
let's
say
that's
the
limit
of
our
loss,
even
if
the
stock--
mr.
patrick
j.
coughlin
--thank
you,
justice
stevens.
