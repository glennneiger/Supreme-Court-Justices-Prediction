and
both
would
be
all
right
because
what's
the
difference
between
not
getting
as
much
appreciation
as
you
would
have
gotten
if
the
correct
information
had
been
out
there
and
getting
less
than
you
would
have
gotten.
i
mean,
in
both
cases
the
shareholder
is
affected
the
same
way.
it
didn't
get
as
much
in
one
case.
so
you're
not
distinguishing
between
those.
i
think
you're
agreeing
that
in
both
cases
the...
the
discovery
of
platinum
is
the
shares
go
up,
but
they
would
have
gone
up
much
higher
if
there
had
been
gold
as
well.
that
shareholder
has
a
claim
under
your
theory,
doesn't
she?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i'm
assuming
that...
that
there
is,
and
so
the
stock
goes
up
but
not
as
much
as
it
would
have.
but
on
the
point
of
disclosure,
there
is
a
difference
between
your
position
and
the
government's,
and
i
really
would
like
you
to
tell
me
if
that's
genuine
or
it's
my
misperception.
your
view
is
there's
the
disclosure
of
the
bad
news,
the
lie,
and
the
price
drops.
in
the
government's
presentation...
and
i'm
reading
from
page
19...
the
fraud
can
be
revealed
by
means
other
than
a
corrective
disclosure
and
a
drop
in
the
stock
price
may
not
be
a
necessary
condition
for
establishing
loss
causation
in
every
fraud
on
the
marketplace.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
hungar,
if
you
look
at
the
forms
of
what's
proper
pleading
under
the
federal
rules
on
causation,
the
sample
pleadings
say,
for
example,
for
money
lent,
the
defendant
owes
the
plaintiff
for
money
lent.
period.
or
for
goods
sold
and
delivered.
nothing
more.
just
alleged
causation.
defendant...
plaintiff
alleges
i
lost
x
amount
and
it
was
caused
by
defendant.
i
thought
you
pointed
to
the
9(b)
rule
because
fraud
must
be
pleaded
with
particularity,
but
causation
does
not,
not
under
the
rules
and
not
under
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that...
that's
to
the...
to
the
allegation
of
fraud,
but
not
causation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
says...
no.
it
said
fraud
must
be
pleaded
with
particularity,
not
all
the
elements
of
a
fraud
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
a...
but
there...
there
is
a
basic
difference
between,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
colloquy
with
mr.
hungar...
one
thing
is
the
particularity
of
pleadings.
yes,
you
have
to
tell
the
details
of
the
fraud.
no,
you
don't
have
to
tell
the
details
of
the
loss.
but
you
do
have
to
have
a
theory
on
which
you
can
recover,
and
if
your
theory
is
simply
i
bought
at
an
inflated
price
and
the
law
doesn't
give
you
a
claim
for
relief
on
that
theory,
then
you're
out
the
window.
there's
no
discovery.
there's
nothing.
you
have
to
have,
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
a
viable
theory
of
relief,
and
that's
the
difference
between...
you
say
it's
enough
that
the
stock
was
selling
for
much
more
than
it
should
have,
and
the
other
side
said,
no,
that's
not
enough.
you
have
to
show
that
when
the
misrepresentation
was
corrected,
the
price
dropped.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
theory
was,
at
least
as
i
read
your
brief,
that
your
loss
occurs
at
the
moment
of
purchase,
not
at
some
later
time,
that
when
you
bought
the
stock,
the
price
was
inflated
and
that's
when
you
suffered
your
loss,
on
the
day
of
the
purchase,
not
at
a
later
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
a
problem.
take
the
concrete
facts
of
this
case.
the
bad
news
about...
what
is
it?
albuterol?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
that
bad
news
didn't
come
out
until
9
months
after
the
end
of
the
period
that
you
identify
for
your
class.
you
say
the
class
is
april
15th,
'97
until
february
24th,
'98
purchases.
the
bad
news
doesn't
come
out
until
november
of
'98.
so
how
could
you
possibly
hook
up
your
loss
to
the
news
that
comes
out
later?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i...
i
thought
that
you
were
trying
to
pick
up
on
the
drop
that
seemed
to
be
attributable
to
the
other--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
and
that's
what...
well,
there...
there
are
two
frauds
going
on.
the
first
one
is
discovered
and
the
price
drops
substantially.
and
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
attribute
that
drop
to
the
other
product.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
one
of
the
problems
for
me
is
the
ninth
circuit
seems
to
think
that
it
has
a
theory...
and
it
is
the
theory
of
your
complaint...
that's
different
from,
say,
the
third
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
says
we
recognize
that
the
loss
is
you
bought
it
at
an
inflated
price,
and
the
ninth
circuit
thinks
that's
different
from
a
circuit
that
says
you
don't
have
any
loss
until
somehow
the
bad
news
comes
out
and
there's
a
drop
in
price
as
a
result.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
that's
what
the
government
was
getting
at
in
the
passage
i
read
earlier
where
they
don't
make
it...
there
must
be
a
statement
by
the
issuer
of
the
correction.
they
have
more
leeway.
but
you...
the
ninth
circuit...
the
litany
that
it's
using,
the...
the
set
of
cases...
for
example,
plaintiffs
were
harmed
when
they
paid
more
for
the
stock
than
it
was
worth.
the...
the
notion
that's
repeated,
that
your
loss
is
established
on
the
day
you
purchase
the
price,
that's
just
wrong,
and
i
think
we
would
have
to
at
a
minimum
say
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
seem--
