justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can...
can
you
tell
me
if...
if
we
had
not
granted
certiorari
in
the
case
and
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
became
final,
what
would
have
happened
on
remand?
what
would
have
happened
in
the
trial
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
wouldn't
there
have
been
a...
a
motion
to
make
the
pleadings
more
specific
and
they
would
have
then
come
up
with
a
measure
of
damages,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
i...
i
assume
you
say
that
the
trial
judge
and...
and
defense
counsel
and...
and
the
trial
court
would
have
had
real
problems
with
this
opinion.
what...
what
were
those
problems--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--insofar
as
the
measure
of
loss
is
concerned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
this
opinion,
how
would...
under
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
how
would
the
jury
have
been
instructed
to
come...
to
calculate
the
loss?
i
assume
you
have
a
problem
with
that
and
i
want
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in...
in
your
view,
is
the
plaintiff
entitled
to
an
expectancy
measure
of
damage,
or
is
it
more
the
traditional
tort
measure
which
is
out-of-pocket
losses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the...
is
the
respondents'
position
properly
characterized
as
asking
for
expectancy
damages
or
is
that
too
simplistic
a
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
thought
that
judge
sneed
recognized
that
if
the
stock
was
sold
before
any
loss
was
incurred,
even
if
there's
been
a
misrepresentation,
recovery
should
be
denied.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
submitting
it
cited
it
for
the
wrong
conclusion.
