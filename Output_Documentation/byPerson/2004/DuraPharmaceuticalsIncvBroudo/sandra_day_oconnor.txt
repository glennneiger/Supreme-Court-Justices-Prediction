what
would
have
happened
if
the
disclosure
about
albuterol
was
made
before
the
company
announced
revenue
shortfalls?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
government--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
tell
us
how
you
differ
with
petitioner
on
what
ought
to
happen
here
and
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
agree
with
the
bottom
line.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
where
do
you
disagree?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
doesn't
the
general
rule
8
governing
complaints...
isn't
that
adequate?
you
have
to
plead
under
that
every
element
of
an
affirmative
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
is
the
government
proposing
that
you
have
to
follow
rule
9
not
8
or
some
other
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
don't
have
to
get
into
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
exactly
what
we're
debating,
i
suppose,
that
very
point.
and...
and
it's
hard
to
justify,
under
this
statute,
finding
a
cause
of
action
before
there's
any
damage
or
if
there
isn't
any.
that's...
that's
just
very
hard
to
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
may
be
clear
but
it
may
be
clearly
wrong.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
why
the
term
loss
causation
is
used
because
under
the
statute
it's...
it's
a
loss
experienced
by
the
plaintiff
caused
by
the
misrepresentation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
government
said
you
don't
want
unnecessary
discovery.
you
have
to
put
out
pleadings
that
make
clear
what
your
theory
is--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--which
yours
don't
do.
