justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
will
now
hear
argument
in
dura
pharmaceuticals
against
broudo.
we
finally
get
to
the
arguments.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
sullivan,
you
refer
to
the
disclosure
as
being
the
key
point
and
when
you
measure
the...
the
loss
and
so
forth.
what
if
the
information
leaks
out
and
there's
no
specific
one
disclosure
that
does
it
all
and
the
stock
gradually
declines
over
a
period
of
6
months?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
you
handle
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
they
don't
know
the
leaks.
the
only
thing
they
can
prove
is
that
there
was
a
gross
false
statement
at
the
time
they
bought
the
stock
and
they
don't
know
what
happened
to
the
decline.
later
on
they
find
out
that
it
gradually
leaked
out.
do
they
have
to
prove
exactly
how
the
information
became
public?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
certainly
may.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hungar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
not
correct
i
don't
think.
i
think
there
could
be
a
completely
fraudulent
statement
but
no...
no
damages
as
a
result
of
it.
there
would
still
be
fraud.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
an
element
of
the
fraud.
it's
an
element
of
the
cause...
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
justice
ginsburg's
point--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
coughlin.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr....
mr.
coughlin,
i'm
afraid
you've
had
a
full
opportunity
to
explain
this
very
difficult
case.
you'll
have
to...
your
time
is
up.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sullivan,
you
have
2
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
sullivan.
the
case
is
submitted.
