justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
difficult
to
figure
out
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
thinking?
i...
i
found
it...
am
i
right?
i
thought
they
said
the...
the
seller
says
we
found
gold.
the
stock
sells
for
$60.
they
have
loads
of
experts
who
say
in
the
absence
of
that
statement,
which
was
a
lie,
we
found
gold,
it
would
have
sold
for
$10.
the
loss
is
$50.
i
mean,
i
take
it
that's
their
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what's
wrong
with
that
theory?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
clear.
i
mean,
it's
certainly
clear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
they
say
it
caused
the
loss,
$50.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
other
problem?
i'm
trying
to
get
a
list
of
what
the
problems
are
with
the
simple
theory.
now,
i've
heard
one
that
you've
ratified.
[laughter]
and...
and
is
there
any
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
can
we...
can
they
prove
this?
$60.
$50
is
wrong,
is
inflated
because
of
the
gold.
it
turns
out
that
gold
never
existed
and
they
knew
it.
the
stock
is
not
selling
for
$60
anymore.
it's
selling
for
$200.
they
found
platinum.
no
one
expected
it.
all
right.
they
want
to
prove
maybe
it
is
selling
for
$200,
but
if
we
had
found
gold
as
well,
it
would
have
sold
for
$250.
can
they
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
loss.
$250
versus
$200.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so
then...
then
on
the
platinum/gold
theory,
you
can't
really
recover
what
would
have
happened
if
there
had
been
gold
because
it
might
be
that
the
stock
would
have
been
worth
$400
if
there
had
been
gold
even
though
15
years
earlier
when
he
only
paid
$50
for
it,
he's
only
out
of
pocket,
at
most,
$50.
but
if
there
had
been
gold,
because
of
the
gold
market
in
the
world,
it
would
have
been
a
lot
more
valuable.
and
you're
saying
he
can't
do
that?
i
don't
know.
maybe
that
question
isn't
in
the
case,
but
that
strikes
me
as
a
difficult
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
surely
they
wanted
to
have
a
person
be
able
to
read
a
complaint
and
just
understand
what
it's
about
in
a
securities
fraud
case.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
could
understand
it
unless
you
have
in
the
complaint
what
your
theory
is.
that's
all.
nobody
is
asking
for
some
facts.
is
your
theory
that
the
loss
took
place
at
the
time
the
person
bought
the
stock
because
he
overpaid
$30?
is
your
theory
that
the
stock
went
down
and,
because
of
that,
he
lost
the
money?
is
your
theory
that
the
stock
didn't
go
down
but
it
would
have
gone
up
more?
all
they're
asking
is
not
for
evidence,
but
a
simple,
clear
explanation
of
the
theory,
and
plead
in
the
alternative
if
you
want.
but
i
mean,
what's
the
problem?
why
is
that
so
hard
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
this
case
doesn't
seem
to
do
it.
i
looked
through
the
entire
complaint.
i
found
exactly
two
paragraphs.
i
didn't.
my
law
clerk
did,
frankly.
[laughter]
but
i
told
him
to
underline
it.
in
paragraph
179,
he
found
the
word,
and
it
caused
damage.
okay?
and
in
paragraph
177,
it
says
the
same.
that's
all
he
could
find.
and
they
were
harmed.
that's
what
it
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
the
things
you're
saying
now
are
matters
for
proof,
and
i...
i
think
the
wiggle
room
in
the
government's
position
was
it
said
it
has
to
be
disclosed
to
the
market
in
some
form
or
other.
well,
if
you're
prepared
to
be
broad
and
turn
those
over
to
the
experts
for
the
proof,
you
end
up
with
your
theory.
the...
the
inflation
comes
out
and
it
comes
out
because
they
didn't
get
the
earnings
that
they
would
have
had
or
there
may
be
many
reasons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
just
have
to
say
at
the
pleading
stage
what
your
theory
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
then
you're
not
saying
what
i
think
justice
scalia
and
i
actually
thought
you
were
going
to
say
which
is
that
the
minute
he
pays
$60
for
a
stock
that
should
be
worth
$30
but
is
$60
because
of
the
lie,
at
that
instant
he
suffered
a
loss.
after
listening
to
you,
i
now
think
you're
saying...
but
i'm
not
sure
because
i've
heard
you
say
things
that
are...
both...
i
now
think
you're
saying,
no,
he
has
not
suffered
a
loss
until
later
on
when
that
$30
comes
out
of
the
price
of
the
stock.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
might
come
out
in
many
different
ways.
it
could
come
out
because
he
announces
i'm
a
liar.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
could
come
out
because
he
doesn't
say
anything
but
it
sort
of
oozes
out
as
earning
reports
come
in,
but
it
has
to
come
out.
now,
if
you're
saying
that,
then
i
find
what
you're
saying
consistent
what
i
think
judge
posner
said.
and
that's
really
what
i'm
interested
in
because
i
read
what
he
said.
it
seemed
to
me
right.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--when
we
have
this
happy
agreement
and
if
you'll
agree,
you
at
least
have
to
prove
what
you...
you
have
to
plead
what
you
intend
to
do,
that
is,
you
have
to
plead
and
there
was
a
loss
and
this
is
my
theory.
i
would
like
to
know...
maybe
we
won't
get
beyond
this,
but
in
looking
at
this,
i
wondered
now
suppose
that
the
stock
goes
up
in
value
because
of
extraneous
things.
can
you
recover
because
it
would
have
been
still
higher?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
with
the
transaction
causation?
because
i
think
you'd
probably
say
with
your
transaction
causation
in
the...
in
the
case
that
the...
that
the
lie
wasn't
there,
we
wouldn't
have
bought
the
stock.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
you
say
that,
they
come
along
and
say,
okay,
you
wouldn't
have
bought
the
stock.
i'll
tell
you,
here's
one
bad
thing
happened.
you
lost
your
$30.
but
there
were
six
good
things
that
happened
that
you
never
thought
of,
and
so
the
stocks
were
four
times
what
it
would
have
been
and
you'd
never
have
those
gains,
just
as
you'd
never
have
the
losses.
how
does
that
factor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
problem
here?
he...
i
mean,
well,
you
heard
what
he
said.
and
it
sounded
to
me
that
he
agrees
with
you
he
has
to
prove
that
in
fact
the
fraud
not
only
led
to
the
overpayment,
but
that
also
later
on
the
client
who
bought
the
stock
lost
money
because
the
market
went
down,
and
that
default,
which
cost
him
the
money,
is
caused
by
the
fraud.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
it
comes
out,
it
just
comes
out
in
subtle
ways
as
well
as
direct
ways.
now,
do
you
agree
with
that?
if
they...
if
you
do,
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
case
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
do
you
disagree?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
comes
form
the
ninth
circuit,
it
is
about
a
private
action
under
the
sec
act,
an
anti
fraud
action
under
the
10b-5.
the
respondents
were
the
plaintiffs
below;
they
bought
stock
in
a
company
called
dura
pharmaceuticals.
and
they
say
that
dura
and
some
of
its
managers
and
directors
made
false
statements
about
whether
the
fda
would
approve
a
new
spray
device.
they
basically
said,
"oh
the
fda
is
likely
to
approve
it"
and
according
to
the
plaintiffs
such
was
not
true
and
they
did
not
approve.
they
said
because
of
that
we
bought
dura's
stock
on
the
open
market
and
moreoevr
when
we
paid
for
the
stock
the
price
was
higher
than
we
otherwise
would
have
paid.
it
was
artificially
inflated
by
the
misrepresentation
about
the
fda.
so,
our
case
law
on
private
actions
and
recent
amendments
to
the
securities
law
say
that
if
you
are
going
to
bring
a
private
fraud
suit
you
have
to
have
suffered
a
loss
and
the
loss
has
to
have
been
caused
by
the
misrepresentation.
so,
the
district
court
looked
at
the
allegations
i
have
just
mentioned
and
said
that
is
not
good
enough.
saying
that
you
paid
too
much
for
the
stock
is
just
not
enough.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed.
it
said
it
is
enough
all
you
have
to
allege
is
that
you
paid
more
for
the
stock
when
you
bought
it
that
you
otherwise
would
have
paid,
say,
i
paid
$30
and
without
the
misrepresentation
about
the
fda
i
would
have
only
had
to
pay
$25.
that
is
good
enough
says
the
the
ninth
circuit
and
that
conclusion
is
what
we
are
reviewing.
well,
we
reverse
the
ninth
circuit;
we
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
wrong
about
that.
in
our
review
just
saying
you
paid
too
much
for
the
stock
is
not
enough
to
show
a
loss
it
does
not
show
that
was
a
loss
and
it
does
not
show
there
was
approximate
causation
of
some
other
loss.
but
one
thing,
the
minute
that
the
purchase
takes
place
there
is
no
lose
the
plaintiff
pays
the
$30
and
he
has
something
in
his
hand
and
at
that
moment
is
worth
$30.
if
he
turns
around
and
resells
it
he
will
get
his
$30
back.
of
course
it
might
later
go
down
in
price
and
he
might
later
lose
money.
but
that
later
loss
might
be
caused
by
many
different
things.
you
cannot
say
it
is
automatically
caused
by
having
paid
too
much
for
the
stock
to
begin
with.
i
mean
there
might
be
a
change
in
economic
conditions,
the
industry
might
change,
the
company
might
change
all
kinds
of
things
might
happen.
the
misrepresentation
may
or
may
not
play
a
role
in
the
later
loss,
but
you
can
say
that
paying
too
much
in
the
beginning
can
help
bring
about
a
later
loss.
but
you
cannot
say
that
paying
too
much
is
the
later
loss
and
you
can
not
say
it
automatically
or
inevitably
will
lead
to
a
later
loss.
so
the
ninth
circuit
approach,
as
a
matter
of
pure
logic,
does
not
seem
well
supported,
and
if
you
look
at
the
precedent
there
is
even
less
support
and
if
you
look
at
the
views
of
the
other
courts
of
appeals
there
is
still
less
support
because
none
of
them
have
adapted
it,
and
if
you
look
at
the
reason
amendments
to
the
securities
laws
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
the
congress,
in
writing
this
laws,
does
not
intend
to
permit
that
particular
approach
to
the
problem.
so,
we
think
they
are
wrong
about
that.
we
also
conclude
that
the
plaintiffs
complaint
was
not
sufficient.
we
have
to
follow
the
rules
of
giving
in
a
complaint
you
have
to
give
the
defendant
a
fair
notice;
it
does
not
take
much.
but
you
do
have
to
give
the
defendant
fair
notice
of
what
you
claim
is
in
the
grounds
upon
which
you
press.
well,
when
you
get
to
loss
in
causation
the
only
thing
this
complaint
talks
about
is
that
inflated
purchase
price,
and
as
we
have
just
said
that
inflated
purchase
price
is
not
itself
the
relevant
loss
and
it
may
or
may
not
mean
a
future
loss
that
you
have
to
allege
more
than
that.
now
for
these
reasons
which
we
explained
further
in
the
opinion
and
other
set
forth,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
remand
for
further
proceedings.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
