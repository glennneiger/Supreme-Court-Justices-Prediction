justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
doesn't
depend
on...
on
what
you...
what
you
consider
to
be
the
value
of
the
stock.
until
the
disclosure
of
the
fact
that
they
didn't
find
gold
is
made,
the
stock
is
still
worth
$60,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
everybody
else
thinks
they
found
gold
too.
so
you're
still
holding
stock
worth
$60,
if
worth
means
its
market
value.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we're
dealing
with
a
special
rule
that
looks
to
market
value.
right?
you
don't
have
to
have
the...
the
representation
made
explicitly
to
the
plaintiff.
it's
a
representation
that
was
made
to
the
market
at
large
which
caused
the
market
value
of
the
stock.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
paid
$60,
he
got
$60.
there's
no
loss.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
matter
in
this
case,
does
it?
is...
is
that
issue
before
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
to
decide
that
issue
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
it...
is
it
easy
to
prove
that...
that
the
price
of
this
now
valuable
stock
because
they
found
platinum
would
have
been
$40
higher
had
they
found
gold?
i
mean,
the
burden
would
be
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
that...
would...
i
mean,
if
we
adopted
that
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
very
hard
to
prove,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
they'd
be
called
reliance
damages.
you
know,
i
used
to
teach
contract
law.
we
would
call
it
reliance
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they...
they
wouldn't
have
to
prove
how
it
came
out.
they
would
just
have
to
prove
that
the
market
knew
the
truth,
no
matter
how
the
market
learned
the
truth.
i
mean,
if
it
was
published
in
a...
in
a
column
by
some
market
reporter
who
doesn't
disclose
how
he
found
out.
so
long
as
the
market
knows
the
truth,
isn't
that
all
they
need?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
any
event,
the
difference
between
getting
the...
the
complaint
dismissed
on
the
pleadings
or
having
to
wait
for
a...
a
12(b)(6)
motion
because
as
soon
as
you,
you
know,
ask
for
the...
the
proof
of
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action,
you're
entitled
to
have,
if...
if
your
analysis
of
the
case
is
correct,
you're
entitled
to
have
the
drop
in...
in
the
value
of
the
stock
shown.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
paid...
they
paid
whether
it
was
a
market
price
or
not.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
what
they
paid
happens
to
be
the
market
price,
but...
but
you
can't
really
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
referring
to
the
market
price
as
part
of
its...
its
damages.
its
damages
are
what
they
paid.
whether
that...
if
they
paid
above
market,
it
would
be
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
don't
understand.
i
mean,
there
would
be
even
more
expectation
taken
out
after
the
fraud
is
announced.
i
mean,
it's
just
like
saying,
you
know,
besides...
besides
fact
that
our
ceo
just
died,
there's
no
gold
there.
don't
you
think
it
would
go
down
still
further?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
reconcile
that
with
your
concession
that
if
the
person
who...
who
buys
it
at
an
inflated
price
turns
around
2
days
later
and
sells
it
at
that
same
inflated
price,
he
cannot
bring
suit?
you
would
not
allow
recovery
in
that
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
how...
how
can
you
reconcile
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
the
notion
that
the
loss
occurred
at
the
time
your
purchased?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
saying
there's
no
losses.
i
mean,
that's...
it's
inconsistent
how
the
losses
come
out.
you
just
told
us
the
loss
occurs,
bang,
when
you
buy
it.
you've
gotten
stock
that
really
isn't
worth
what
you
paid
for
it,
the
notion
of...
of
worth
as
some...
you
know,
some
objective
thing
rather
than
what...
what
people
are
willing
to
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
your
theory
and
it
seems
to
me
you're
stuck
with
it.
and
if
that
theory
is
true,
then
it
shouldn't
matter
that
you
later
sell
it
to
some
other
poor,
unsuspecting
individual
for
the
same
amount
you
bought
it
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
show
what
before
recovery?
you
have
to
show?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
they're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
me
your...
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
worrying
me
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think...
i
think
you're...
i
think
you're
agreeing
with
the
petitioners.
i
think
this...
this
whole
thing
is
a
great
misunderstanding.
you...
you
didn't--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
cited...
i
thought
cited
knapp
and...
which,
in
turn,
cited
gray
or...
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
if
you're
worried
about
it,
why
aren't
you
worried
about
it
later,
as
well
as
earlier?
i
mean,
if
that's
going
to
be
a
problem,
we
should
know
it
sooner
rather
than
later,
rather
than...
you
know.
if
you
say
that's
terribly
difficult
to
prove,
we
can
hardly
ever
prove
it,
well,
good.
then
let's
get
rid
of
this...
rid
of
the
case
earlier.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
i
don't
know
why...
why
it's
desirable
not
to
include
that
at
the
pleading
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what...
i'm...
i'm
really
coming
to
believe
that
this
is
a
misunderstanding.
it
seems
to
me
you're
now
saying
that
the
loss
does
not
occur
when
you
make
the
purchase.
it
is
just
that
that
is
the
limit
on
your
loss,
the
difference
between
what
the
stock
would
have
cost
you
had
the...
the
absence
of
gold
been
known
and
what
you
actually
paid.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
is
not
your
loss.
you're
saying
now
the
loss
has
to
occur
later
when
the
price
goes
down
and
you're
thereby
harmed.
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
about
it,
but
the
market
knows
about
it.
that's...
that's
why
the
stock
has
gone
down.
