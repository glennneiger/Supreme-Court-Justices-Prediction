mr.
william
f.
sullivan
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
disparate
views
of
what
kind
of
loss
is
necessary
to
sustain
a
claim
for
securities
fraud
under
the
reform
act's
loss
causation
requirement.
the
minority
view
of
artificial
inflation
articulated
by
the
ninth
circuit
is
illogical
and
equates
loss
with
purchase,
regardless
of
whether
the
investor
has
suffered
any
economic
harm.
an
investor
does
not
suffer
any
harm
until
some
form
of
corrective
disclosure
occurs
and
the
artificial
inflation
is
removed
from
the
stock.
the
two
events
must
be
related.
there
is
no
causal
connection
between
the
harm
and
the
misrepresentation
otherwise.
the
majority
rule
correctly
requires
a
causal
connection
between
the
misrepresentation
and
a
decline
in
value.
the...
and
the
statute
itself
is
expressed
in
terms
of
causation
that
a
plaintiff
prove
that
the
act
of
the
defendant
caused
the
loss.
when
we
look
at
the
statute
of
the
reform
act
and
other
provisions,
we
see
supporting
language.
in
section
21d
of
the
reform
act,
we
see
under
the
provision
that
has
been
known
as
the
look-back
provision
that
the
congress
discussed
the
loss
in
terms
of
trading
price
after
a
corrective
disclosure.
similarly
in
section
105
of
the
reform
act,
although
dealing
with
section
12
of
the
securities
act,
the
reform
act,
in
its
one
place
where
it
actually
spoke
of
loss
causation
and
its
definition,
defined
it
in
terms
of
depreciation
in
value.
and
the...
the
depreciation
in
value
of
the
security
would
be
attributable
to
the
fraud.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
at
the
trial
court,
the--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--well,
the
ninth
circuit
remanded
for
specific
reasons
on
repleading,
which
your
honor
has
articulated,
and
those
would
have
occurred.
the
other
issues
relating
to
loss
raise
questions
concerning
whether
some
of
the...
the
claims
might
be
time
barred
and
whether
or
not
those
claims
could
be
stated.
so
that
would
have
raised
a
different
issue.
in
addition,
throughout
the
pleadings
of
this
case...
we're
now
on
the
third
complaint...
the...
the
plaintiffs
have
not
raised
that
issue
and
have
not
sought
to
plead
causation
consistent
with
the...
our
view
of
the
world.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
well--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--well,
the...
the
real
problems
that
the
trial
court
had
and
what
we
would
continue
to
espouse
with
this
opinion
is
that
it
doesn't
link
the
loss
with
the
misrepresentation.
and
in
this
case,
the
misrepresentation
offered
occurred
9
months
after
the
price
drop
that
is
being
sought.
i
think
when
you...
when
you
carve
it
all
back
and
you
look
at
what
the
real
issue
is,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it's...
it
becomes
an
issue
of
what...
what
damages
does
the
plaintiffs'
class
seek.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
the...
the
problem
is
we
wouldn't
have
been
able
to...
to
frame
a
clear
jury
instruction
that
would
have
indicated
whether
or
not
the
loss
that
the
jury
should
look
at
would
be
related
to
the
disclosure
about
albuterol
spiros,
which
would
have
occurred
in
the
november
time
frame,
or
whether
we
would
have
had
to
step
back
to
the
february
time
frame
and...
and
the
loss
that
was
incurred
then.
and
the
issue
would
have
not
only
related
to
the...
the
damages
instructions
but
would
have
related
to
the
misrepresentation
instruction.
and
the...
the
problem
that...
that
we
continue
to
have
with
the...
the
case
after
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
is
where
do
you
look
for
the
misrepresentation
and
where
do
you
look
for
the
damage
and
how
do
you
know
that
there
is
a
loss
under
the
statute.
you're
looking
at
a...
at
a--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--well,
i
think
that
would
have
been
different.
that
would
have
been
a
disclosure
prior
to
the...
to
the
drop,
and
there...
i
would
expect
under
pleading
that
the
plaintiffs
could
have
done,
they
could
have
tied
the
two
of
them
together
and
argued
that
the
cause
of
the
loss
was
the
combination
of
the
two
events
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
that...
that
would
be
the
theory
under
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
well,
the--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--the
problem
with...
with
that
theory
is
that
congress
has
told
us
that
the
misrepresentation
has
to
have
caused
the
loss
and--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--and...
and
what
we
would
be
looking
for
is
evidence
that...
that
such
a
actual
loss
occurred
in
response
to
a
corrective
disclosure
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
yes,
it
is.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
and
would
have
the
ability
to
continue
to
sell
that
stock
for
$60
in
the
marketplace
until
such
time
as
there
was
a
corrective
disclosure.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
thank
you.
the...
the
other
is...
is
i
think
an
issue
of
certainty
as
to
the
marketplace.
remember,
we
are
operating
on
a
fraud-on-the-market
theory
context
here
in
this
kind
of
action,
and
in
that...
in
that
context,
when
there
is
a
disclosure
in
the
marketplace,
you
have
certainty
as
to
what
the
market
actually
valued
the
decline
to
be
as
opposed
to
speculation
that
there
was
in
fact
inflation
at
the...
at
the
time
of
purchase.
the
ninth
circuit's
purchase
time
rule
in
the...
in
the
fraud-on-the-market
context
doesn't
necessarily
identify
the
decline
in
the
value
of
the
stock
which
you
can
get
from
the
marketplace,
and
that
i
think
is
just
better...
a
better
indicator.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
the
congress
has
told
us
that
we
should
look
for
loss,
and
that--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--and
that
leads
us
to
the...
the
point
that...
that
whether
the
increase
can
actually
be
pled.
but
if
there
is
a
disclosure
that
indicates
that
the
gold
component
was
not
part
of
the...
of
the...
the
discoveries,
and
the
plaintiffs
can
indicate
that
there
was
an
upward
tick
because
of
the
platinum
and
a
downward
movement
in
the
stock
because
of
the
disclosure
about
gold,
then
i
think
those
two
can
be
separated
and
pled
accordingly.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
well,
that
shareholder...
it
would
depend
on
what
has
happened
in
the
marketplace.
if
there
has
not
been
a
disclosure
about
the
absence
of
gold,
that
stock
would
still
reflect
the...
the
value
of
the
expectation
of
gold.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
our
position
is
we
believe
that
a
drop
in
the
price
is
necessary
to
demonstrate
the
loss.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
they
do.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
in
this
case--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--we
don't
have
to
decide
that
issue
for
this
case.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
the
plaintiff
has
that
burden--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--and...
and
at
the
pleading
stage,
i
believe
that
they
could
be
segregated
and...
and
an
upward
movement
in
the
stock
could
be
distinguished
from
a
downward
movement
in
the
stock.
but
the
downward
movement
in
stock
would
be
the
focus
from
our
standpoint.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
we
don't
believe
that
they
are
entitled
to
any
expectation
damages.
it
would
be
an
out-of-pocket
loss
calculation.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
i...
i
think
that
it
is
perhaps
inclusive
of
expectancy.
it
really
depends
on
how
you
view
their
price
inflation
theory.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
and
it
gets
back
in
our
view
to
the
transaction
causation
distinction
in
the
securities
cases
that
talk
about
the
reliance
transaction,
price
inflation
that
occurs
at
the
front
end.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
following
your...
your
suggestion
about
the
price
of
gold,
it
would
depend
on
where
that...
that
disclosure
occurred
in
connection
with
the
price
of...
the
price
of
gold,
if
that
disclosure
occurred,
and
if
there
was
an
economic
loss
that
could
be...
could
be
tied
to
it.
the
passage
of
time
here
is
important
only
insofar
as
it
allows
for
the
corrective
disclosure
and
a
chance
for
the
market
to
reflect
an
economic
loss.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
i
think--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--i
think
that
a
plaintiff
would
be
able
to
handle
that
in...
in
a
pleading
and
they
would
have
to
identify
the
leaks
and
if
there
are
several,
identify
each
of
them
and
identify
them
as--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--the
key
is
that
they
have
to
prove
that
the
loss
was
connected
to
the
misrepresentation
and
that
the
drop
in--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--so
i
was
distinguishing...
yes
is
the
answer
to
your
question.
i
was
distinguishing
a
situation
where
the
price
just
trickled
down
and
no
one
knew
until
later.
and
the...
the
question
that
justice
scalia
poses
about
the...
the
leak
coming
out
over
time
but
it
is
the...
the
fact
that
the
market
becomes
aware
of
the
reason
for
the
misrepresentation,
it
is
in
fact
appropriate.
the...
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
in
addition
to
the
statutory
scheme,
is...
is
this
court's
decision
in
basic
v.
levinson
creates
a
tension
here,
and
i...
and
i
think
a
conflict
that
is
very
important
to...
to
discern.
the...
basic
v.
levinson
presents
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory,
and
from
that
fraud-on-the-market
theory
we
have
a
rebuttable
presumption
of
reliance
for
transaction
causation.
the
ninth
circuit's
view
collapses
the...
the
ninth...
the
ninth
circuit's
view
of
transaction
causation
with
loss
causation
and
presents
a
conflict
as
it
relates
to
that
presumption.
the
presumption,
which
is
based
on
a
well-developed,
efficient
capital
market
that
gets
the
information
out
quickly
and
is
easily
digestible...
that...
that
presumption
is
at
odds
with
the
reform
act's
requirement
that
there
be
a
burden
of
proof.
if
you
collapse
the
transaction
causation
and
the
loss
causation,
you've
got
a
head-on
collision
between
the
rebuttable
presumption
of
reliance
and
the
congress'
codification
of
the
loss
causation
act
and
the
reform
act.
and
we
think,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
really
renders
that
conflict
apparent
and
makes
the
act
of
congress
in
the
reform
act
one
that
was
meaningless.
the...
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
also
supportive
of
our
position
so
far
as
particularly
the
senate
report
is
very
important
in
the...
in
the
phrase
where
it
talks
about
the
obligation
of
the
plaintiff
to
prove
that
the
loss
in
the
value
of
the
stock
was
caused
by
the
section
10(b)
violation
and
not
by
other
factors.
that
is
a
critical
component
here
of
the
analysis
and
i
think
very
helpful
from
the
standpoint
of
the
legislative
history
in
identifying
what
we
have.
finally,
i...
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
the
reform
act
from
congress
was
designed
to
and
sought
to
establish
uniform
and
fairly
stringent
pleading
guidelines,
and
this
was
to
address
congressional
concerns
over
frivolous
suits.
and
congress,
in
enacting
the
reform
act,
was
not
signaling
any
intention
to
relax
the
requirements
of
section
10(b),
was...
rather,
was
enacting
a
very
specific
loss
causation
requirement.
and
historically
there
was
a
very
clear
and
distinct
body
of
law
at
the
time,
the
huddleston
case,
the
bastian
case,
and
that
was
codified.
and
there
was
a
very
clear
perception
that
congress
was
acting
and
not
collapsing
the
loss
causation
transaction
rule
into
the
loss...
the
transaction
causation
into
the
loss
causation,
which
i
think
creates
this
conflict.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
justice
stevens,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
thank
you.
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
point
i
think
i
want
to
focus
upon
for
the...
for
the
court
is...
is
the
comment
in
the
senate
report
which
said
that
the
damages
had
to
be
a
result
of
the
cause...
the...
the
misrepresentation,
not
other
factors.
i
think
what
we've
just
heard
about,
in
terms
of
the
decline
in
the
market
value,
is...
is
a
look
at
a
number
of
the
other
factors.
and
there
are
disclosures
that
are
related
to
fraud
and
there
are
disclosures
that
are
not
related
to
fraud.
and
if
there
was
a
misrepresentation
in
the
marketplace,
that...
that
is
one
thing.
if
a
new
competitor
comes
out
with
a
new
product,
that's
not--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--and...
and--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--i
would...
i
would
agree
with
you
and...
and
i
would
just--
mr.
william
f.
sullivan
--i
would
just
add...
i
don't
disagree.
i
would
add
that
the
cause
is
not
by
other
factors
because
i
think
when
we
heard
the
discussion
about
the...
the
reduction
of
inflation,
we
were
hearing
about
factors
other
than
that.
i
just
want
to
close
by
saying
the
loss
causation
codification
in
the
reform
act
was
meaningful
and
was
part
of
the
reform
act.
and
that
really
indicates
that
this
is
a
pleading
standard
that
we...
we...
we're
dealing
with,
that
the
cause
of
action
for
a
securities
fraud
has
to
be
stated
at
the
time.
and
that's
consistent
with
what
the
reform
act
was
trying
to
achieve
which
is
to
give
the
defendants
a
chance
to
respond
and
actually
have
the
motion
to
dismiss
serve
as
a
meaningful
screen
in
dealing
with
those
cases.
thank
you.
