justice
david
h.
souter
one
of
your...
i
think
it
was
yours,
rather
an
amicus
argument
for...
for
reading
113
is
you
say
it
would
have
a
bearing
on
reading
107,
and
that
was
that
congress
didn't
want
to
permit
suits
prior
to
some
definitive
resolution
of
a
claim,
whether
it
be
by
settlement
or
whatnot.
and
the
reason
was
that
if...
if
the
one
joint
tortfeasor
could
sue
prior
to
that
time,
there
would
be
liability
against
another
who
would
still
be
open
to
action
by
epa--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
even
yet
a
third
joint
tortfeasor.
their
response
to
that
was
epa
resolves
lots
of
actions
without
complete
cleanup,
so
that
the
possibility,
even
in
contribution
cases
that
you
would
allow,
would
be
later
epa
action
against
another
polluter.
what...
what
is
your
response
to
that,
if
i've
got
it
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
really
disputing
the...
the
fact
of...
of
their
response?
in
other
words,
they
say,
look,
epa
resolve...
settles
these
things
without
complete
cleanup,
and
you're
saying
that
really
isn't
the
way
it
works?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
if...
so
that
if
it
is
done,
there
won't
be
further
epa
action
against
yet
another
polluter
for
that
site.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
the...
if
that's
the
case
then,
whether...
whether...
even...
even
in
a...
in
a
case
of
contribution
brought
under
113,
the
person
against
whom
contribution
is
obtained
might
still
be
liable
to
epa
if
epa
later
proceeds
against
that
person.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's...
there's
one
argument,
isn't
there?
and
that
is,
in
the
first
sentence,
it
speaks
of...
of
a
civil
action
under
107.
then
in
the
savings
clause,
it
says,
nothing,
et
cetera,
shall
diminish
the
right
to
bring
an
action
for
contribution
in
the
absence
of
a
civil
action.
it
seems
to
be
talking,
you
know,
under...
of
107...
it
seems
to
be
talking
about
something
other
than
107.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may
be
what
it
means,
and...
and
maybe
that's
the
way
it
ought
to
be
construed.
but
it's
not
clear,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
is
your
answer
to
their
response
to
the
loophole
argument
that,
in
point
of
fact,
you
can...
if
you
want
to
undertake
this
cleanup,
all
you've
got
to
do
basically
is
go
to
epa
and
say,
look,
we
want
to
get
into
circumstances
in
which
we
can
have
a
settlement
with
you
so
that
during
or
after
it,
we
can...
we
can
go
for
contribution?
what's
your
answer
to
that,
that
you
have
an
avenue
to
get
where
you
want
to
go?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may...
how
about
the
answer
to
the
practical
question
that
justice
ginsburg
raised
with
your
friend
on
the
other
side?
is
it
easy
to
do
what
they
suggest,
or
is
it
difficult
to
do
what
they
suggest?
