mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
involving
the
comprehensive
environmental
response
compensation
and
liability
act,
or
cercla,
which
was
enacted
in
1980,
as
amended
by
the
superfund
amendments
and
reauthorization
act,
which
was
amended
in
1986
and
is
known
as
sara.
both
the
petitioner,
cooper
industries,
and
the
respondent,
aviall
services,
are
potential
responsible
parties
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
statute.
they
are
prior
owners
of
property
sites
in
texas,
and
there
was
hazardous
waste
that
was
deposited
on
those
sites
prior
to
and
during
their
ownership
of
the
property
based
on
the
aircraft
maintenance
operations
that
went
on
at
the
site.
aviall
services
proceeded
to
engage
in
cleanup
activities
on
its
own
and
undertook
to
do
cleanup
work
on
the
property.
it
then
sued
the
petitioner,
cooper
industries,
for
a
recovery
of
those...
of
costs
of
cleanup,
a
contribution
action
both
under
113(f)(1)
of
the
federal
statute
and
also
under
state
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
the
original
complaint
that
they
filed
had
a
107
action
and
a
113
action.
they
amended
the
complaint
and
went
forward
only
under
113.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
they--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--yes.
i
believe
they
did
that
because
the
fifth
circuit
and
other
courts
of
appeals
have
said
that
the
107
action
is...
for
cost
recovery
is
not
available
to
one
who
has
contributed
to
the
contamination
of
the
property,
that
that
is
a
cause
of
action
that
can
be
maintained
by
a
innocent
landowner...
let's
say
a
homeowner
who
didn't
have
any
participation
and
is...
finds
out
the
that
property
is
contaminated...
but
not
by
a
party
that
has
actually
contributed
to
the...
to
the
contaminated
condition.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i...
i
think
what
the
district
court
did
is
invited
them
to
clarify
whether
they
were
proceeding
under
107
or
113,
and
in
the
course
of
the
colloquy
at
the
district
court,
they
made
it
clear
that
they
were
proceeding
under
113
and
that
they
believed
that
107
was
unavailable
to
them
as
a
contributor
to
the
contaminated
property.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i...
i
think
what
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
is
that
if
you
have
a...
an
action
for
contribution
as
one
who
has
contaminated
the
property,
then
you
must
proceed
under
113.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
you
can't
proceed
under
107.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i...
i
don't
believe
would
i
fault
a
litigant
for
that,
your
honor.
the
point
is
that
in
order
to
proceed
under
113,
the
statute
is
very
clear
that
a
right
of
contribution
by
a
responsible
party
under
113
is
some...
is
an
action
that
can
be
maintained
during
or
following
what
is
an
enforcement
action
under
106
or
107
of
cercla
brought
by
the
united
states
or
by
the...
of
by
a
state.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
actually
the
cleanup
of
the
property
was
initiated
before
the
state
got
involved
in...
in
conversations.
i
think
that
while
they
were
cleaning
up
the
property,
the
record
shows
that
there
were...
there
were
communications
with
the
state
in
connection
with
the
activities
in
the
cleanup,
but
it
was--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
the
state
compelled
the
cleanup.
i
certainly
think
that
the
communications
with
the
state
suggested
that...
that
it
was
a
good
that
they
were
cleaning
it
up,
and
the
state
wanted
the
property
cleaned
up.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but
it
was
not...
there
was
no
compulsory
action
by
the
state.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i...
i
think
you
can
construe
this...
the
law
to
say
clean
up
sooner.
the
law
says...
actually
provides
explicitly
in
113(f)(3)(b)
that
if
you
settle
with
the
state...
if,
indeed,
the
state
says
to
you,
clean
this
up
and
clean
up
it
sooner,
you
can
enter
into
a
settlement
with
the
state
to...
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
cleanup
that
satisfies
what
are
the
requirements
for
cleaning
up
these
sites,
and
that
if
you
do
that,
then
you
can
come
in
and
sue
for
contribution
because
113(f)(1)
gives
you
a
right
of
contribution
in
those
circumstances.
so
this
is
not
a
statute
that
discourages
you
from
working
with
the
state.
if
you
are
approached
by
the
state
and
it
says
clean
up
property,
it
simply
says
that
if
you
are
approached
by
the
state
and
you
want
to
work
with
them,
you
have
to
do
it
pursuant
to
a
settlement
in
order
to
get
contribution.
if
you
don't
do
that,
the
other
avenue
for
contribution
that
the
federal
statute
allows
is
to
proceed
in
a
contribution
action
during
or
following
an
enforcement
action
by
the
federal
government
under
106
or
107.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
there
is
a
process
that's
available
to
everybody
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
epa
to
clean
up
these
sites
and
to...
and
to
engage
in
settlements
that
would
allow
for
contribution.
the
way
that
the
provision
was
written...
the
113
provision
was
added
to
the
statute...
it
actually
provides
incentives
for
parties
to
come
in,
to
enter
into
negotiations
to
get
settlements
with
the
federal
and
state
governments.
and
indeed,
the...
the
statute
provides
for
a
right
of
contribution
if
you
do
that
and
also
protects
the
party
that's
cleaning
up
from
contribution
suits
that
might
be
brought
by
someone
else
if
they
engage
in
those
kinds
of
discussions
and
settlements.
so
the
statute
is
one
that
has
incentives
built
into
it
to
work
within
the
structure
that...
and
the
scheme
that
congress
devised
so
as
to
permit
parties
that
are
intent
on
cleaning
up
their...
these
sites
to
go
ahead
and
clean
them
up
and
clean
them
up
under
the
auspices
and
with
the...
with
the
supervision
of
the
government.
and
there's
a
reason
for
that
because
when
cercla
was
first
passed...
and
there
was
no
contribution
provision
at
that
time...
it
was
enacted
because
there
wasn't
a
whole
lot
of
voluntary
action.
and
what
congress
says
is
we
need
to
get
the
government
involved.
we
need
to
get
them
to
enter...
give
them
the
tools
to
get
involved
with
these
sites,
to
make
sure
they're
cleaned
up.
we
set
out
a
scheme
for
it
to
be
cleaned
up
in
a
way
that
means
it's
a
meaningful,
comprehensive
cleanup,
and
if
you
follow
that
scheme
that
has
been
devised,
you
get
the
benefit
of
being
able
to
pursue
contribution
actions
once
you
do
things
in
the
way
that
that
has
been
set
up
by
congress
to
ensure
it's
a...
it's
a
comprehensive
cleanup.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i...
i
believe
that
there's...
there
is
a
107
action
by
a
prp
who
is
what
they
have...
the
courts
have
termed
an
innocent
prp,
one
who
was
not
involved
in
contributing
to
the...
to
the
contaminated
condition.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
do
not
think
that
there...
well,
i
think
that
in
this
case
the
fifth
circuit
and
most
of
the
other
circuits
that
have
addressed
it
have
said
that
if
you
are
a
contributor
to
the
pollution,
your
remedy
to
go
after
other
prp's
is
to
avail
yourself
of
the
contribution
provision
and
that
you
don't
have
a
right
of
action
for
cost
recovery
under
107
separate
and
apart
from
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
justice
o'connor,
i...
i
think
you're...
you
are
correct
that
that
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
there
are...
there
are
different
courts,
lower
courts,
that
have
spoken
to
it.
generally
the
lower
courts
that
have
spoken
to
it
have
said
that
with
enactment
of
113,
the
right
of
contribution
provision
is
the
one
that
should
be
the
applicable
way
in
which
to
proceed,
and
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
but--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--well,
i...
i
think
that
it
is
clear,
if
you
read
113,
that
there's
nothing
in
113
that
would
suggest
that
this
particular
prp
would
have
an
ability
to
sue
under
107.
and
113
says
you
have
your
right
of
contribution
during
or
following
a
107,
and
there
has
been
no
during
or
following.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
my
answer...
i
have
two
answers
to
that
question.
the
first
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
prior
to
enactment
of
this
amendment,
there
was
recognized
by
the
courts
an
implied
right
of
contribution
under
107
because
the
congress
had
not
addressed
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
implied
right
of
contribution
was
recognized
in
every
case
in
circumstances
where
there
had
been
an
enforcement
action
under
107
and--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--there...
there
are
no
cases
that
we've
been
able
to
find
that
would
have
allowed
for
this
particular
action
under
107.
i
think
that
that
question
raises
a
fundamental
problem,
as
i
see
it,
because
a--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--contribution...
the
contribution
is
available
in
common
law,
but
common
law
of
contribution
does
not
recognize
contribution
among
joint
tortfeasors.
and
that
would
be
the
kind
of
107
action
you're
implying
here.
at
common
law,
somebody
who
is
a
joint
tortfeasor
couldn't
use
contribution
to
go
after
another
joint
tortfeasor.
what
you
had
at
common
law
was
shared
liability
against
a
third
party,
the
discharge
of
the
debt
to
the
third
party,
and
then
you
go
after
the
other
liable
tortfeasor.
and
i
think
that
to
assume
or...
or
read
into
what
107
provided
would
have
been...
would
have
required
the
court
to
say
that
107
is
allowing
for
a
right
of
contribution
that
the
common
law
has
never
recognized.
so...
and
the
courts
did
not
do
that.
the
courts
implied
a
right
of
contribution
only
with
respect
to
the
106-107
action.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
the
only
one
where
there
was
a
suggestion
that
we
could
find,
your
honor,
was
in
a
district
court
in
florida
that
got
dismissed
because
there
hadn't
been
enough
government
action
in
the
cleanup.
every
other
case
that
we've
been
able
to
find
were
cases
where
they
implied
a
right
of
action
for
contribution
in
circumstances
where
you...
you
had
a
106
or
107
action,
and
if
they
allowed
for
a
cost
recovery
action
under
107,
it
was
because
you
were
dealing
with
an
innocent
party
that
was
seeking
full
costs.
and
what
congress
did
in
sara,
in
the
amendment,
is
it's...
it
looked
at
that
body
of
law
that
was
out
there,
and
it
said
it
was
going
to
make
explicit
what
was
implicit
by
reason
of
those
cases.
and...
and
it's
quite
clear
that
that's
what
congress
set
about
doing.
the...
the
language
of
the
savings
clause
says
that
the...
nothing
in
the
enabling
sentence
shall
diminish
a
right
of
contribution
in
the
absence
of
106
or
107.
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
question
you've
asked
about
whether
there
was
a
107
cost
recovery
action
would
necessarily
have
been
an
action
in
the
presence
of
107.
so
that
was
not
contemplated
by
this
statute.
if
indeed
a...
there
had
been
a...
a
line
of
cases
of
that
sort,
congress
was
not
looking
at
that
to
say
that
they
were
codifying
that
as
part
of
their
right
of
federal
contribution.
that
was
not
what--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--if
there
is
a
civil
action--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--well,
i
think
if--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i'm
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
right
of
contribution,
as
it's
understood
today,
still
contemplates
shared
liability
by...
by
the
two
parties,
the...
the
tortfeasors,
as
against
a
third
party.
and...
and
to
the
extent
that
there
may
have
been
relaxation
in...
in
that
concept--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--it
would
only
be
in
terms
of
whether
you
could
bring
it
during
the
107
action
or
following.
and
they
have
said
that
you
don't
need
to
wait
until
the
107
action
in
this
case
is
completed.
you
could
do
it
during.
but
i
believe
that
is
still
the
case,
that
for
a
right
of
contribution
to
exist,
it's
not
one
tortfeasor
who
can
sue
for
recovery
and
contribution
against
another.
it's
a
situation
where
you
have
liability,
shared
liability,
to
third...
to
a
third
party.
and
in
those
circumstances,
the
right
of
contribution
is
recognized.
and
that's
what
congress
set
about
to
codify
in
the...
in
the
provision.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think,
your
honor,
that
where
epa
is
involved...
and
the
reason
that
it's
important
it's
involved
is
it...
epa
assures
that
the
cleanup
that
we're
talking
about
is
comprehensive,
and
when
it
gets
involved
and
it--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--my...
my
understanding
is
that
epa
does,
indeed,
require
that
the
cleanup
be
done
in
accordance
with
the
national
contingency
plan
and
the
other
requirements
that
they
have
in
their...
in
their
regulations.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
unless
it's
outside
of
or
even
in
the...
in
the
provision
of
the
statute.
if
you
have
a
settlement
with
epa,
there
can
be
action
against
another
polluter
for
some
additional
pollution
that
was
not
settled
and
taken
care
of
with
respect...
if
you
have
multiple
sites,
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
site--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--but...
but
the
point
here
that
we
were
making
in
our
brief
and
i
think
is...
is
a
response
to...
to
what
you're
asking...
the...
the
point
here
wouldn't
be
inconsistent
liability
and
it
wouldn't
be
duplicative
liability.
it
would
be
liability
that
would
be
attributable
with
the
epa's
involvement
for
the
specific
cleanup
that
was
in
question,
and
you
may
be
liable
for
some
other
aspect,
but
it
wouldn't
be
the
kind
of
duplication
and
multiplication
that
you'd
get
if
you
read
the
statute
the
way
respondent--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--your
honor,
certainly
for
purposes
of
this
case,
i'm
not
sure
that
needs
to
be
resolved.
i
would
say
this,
that
in
a
settlement
you
can
get
contribution,
if
you
have
a
civil
action.
the
courts
have
looked
at
whether
an
administrative
order
under
106
that
is
not
necessarily
reduced
to
a...
a
judgment,
whether
that
would
qualify
as
a
106
civil
action.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
and
there
have
been
different
views
that
have
been
addressed
on
that.
