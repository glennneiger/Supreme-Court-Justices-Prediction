mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
submits
that
section
113(f)
does
not
allow
contribution
in
the
absence
of
a
settlement
or
civil
action
for
three
reasons.
first,
that's
exactly
what
section
113(f)
says.
second,
that's
consistent
with
the
traditional
understanding
of
the
concept
of
contribution.
and
third,
that
will
lead
to
the
most
efficient
mechanism
for
cleanup
and
settlement.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
this
case
presents
the
first
time
that
the
question
of
whether
a
person
who
is
a
whole...
wholly
a
volunteer
is
entitled
to
contribution.
we've
not
addressed
that
issue
before,
except
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
there
was,
but
in
this
case
there
was
no
action
that
we
understand
that
actually
compelled
the...
aviall
to
clean
up
the
site.
we
do...
do
not
understand
that
there
was
a
enforcement
action
that
was
brought
against
them.
if
i
can
continue--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
i
understand
there
was
a
threat
of
enforcement.
but
if
i
can
continue
to
answer
justice
stevens'
question.
respondents
in
the
red
brief,
pages
13
and
18,
they
cite
two
quotations
from
one
court
of
appeals
brief
that
was
filed
about
8
years
ago
in
a
case
called
centerior.
this
was
a
case
that
was
filed
as
an
appellee,
so
of
course,
the
solicitor
general
did
not
review
the
brief.
i
would
note
that
the
quote
on
page
13
is
consistent
with
our
current
position.
as
we
said
then
and
we
say
now,
that
in
order
for
a
responsible
party
to
sue
another
responsible
party,
they
must
proceed
in
contribution.
that's
what
the
quote
on
page
13
of
the
red
brief
says.
on
page--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--on
that
point,
there's
been
no
change,
and
in
fact
we
repeated
it
to
this
court--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
exactly.
i'm
getting
there.
but
i
think
it's
important
to...
what
they're
characterizing
as
a
change
in
position
is
a
consistent
position.
i
want
to
point
out
that
we
took
that
very
position
in
the
pinal
creek
invitation
brief
that
we
filed
in
this
case
that's
cited
in
page...
at
page...
footnote
10
of
our
invitation
brief
here
and
footnote
9
of
the...
the
brief
on
the
merits.
the
second
place
where
they
claim
an
inconsistency
is
on
page
18
where
they
cite
that...
the
statement
in
the
centerior
brief
that
says
that
we
are
not
saying
that
113(f)(1)
is
the
only
mechanism
for
allowing
contribution.
and
that
is
in
fact
true,
but
we
also
would
say
that
a
settlement
would
allow
as
well...
would
allow
contribution
as
well.
ultimately,
the
centerior
brief
did
not
address
the
issue
that
we
have
here:
what
happens
in
the
absence
of
any
type
of
enforcement
action
whatsoever
or
a
settlement?
so
in
fact,
this
is
the
first
time
we've
addressed
the
issue.
now,
in
terms
of
our
internal
deliberations
in
the...
in
the
government,
there
might
well
be
people
who
take
a
different
view
with
regard
to
the
position
we've
taken
here
from
the
perspective
that
the
more
suits
that
are
brought,
the
more
cleanup
there
might
be.
but
ultimately,
our
obligation
is
to...
excuse
me...
is
to
construe
the
statute
according
to
its
terms.
and
then
as
mr.
reynolds
pointed
out,
section
113(f)(1)
makes
quite
clear
that
a
contribution
action
can
only
be
brought
in...
in
the
presence
of
a
pending
or
ongoing
106
or
107
enforcement
action.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
and
your
honor,
we'd
still
say
that
it
does
not
say
that
it
may
only
be
brought
in
the...
in
the
case
of
a...
in
the
absence
of
a
civil
action
or
a...
a
civil
action
under
106
or
107.
it
can
also
be
brought
in
the
case
of
a
settlement
as
well.
so
that's
what
i
mean.
this
brief
is
not
inconsistent
with
what
we're
saying
here.
it
actually
addresses
a
point
that's
different
where
we
have
made
a...
a
modest
change
in
position
with
regard
to
an
issue
that's
not
before
the
court.
this
brief
suggests
that
contribution
would
be
available
in
the
face
of
a
106
order.
it
implies
that.
it
doesn't
come
right
out
and
say
it,
but
that's
certainly
the
implication
of
the
brief.
now,
there's
no
106
order
in
this
case.
and
the
problem
with
allowing
contribution
in
the
case
of
a
106
order
is
that
section
113(f)(1)
speaks
of
civil
actions.
it
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
administrative
orders.
it
does
allow
contribution
in
the
case
of
an
administrative
settlement.
so
if,
for
instance,
the
government
issues
an
administrative
order
and
the
party
agrees
to
comply
with
that
administrative
order
through
an
administrative
order
on
consent,
that
would
entitle
the
party
to
contribution.
now,
the
reason
why
this
is
important
is
because
it's
our
view
that
contribution
should
only
be
available
consistent
with
the
common
law
principle
of
contribution
in
the
case
in
which
there's
an
extinguishment
of
the
underlying
liability.
that
is
the
very
essence
of
contribution,
that
there
is
some
third
party
liability
that
is
being
resolved.
and
what
113(f)
requires
is
that...
that
the
liability
for
the
state
or
federal
government
to
be
resolved,
in
whole
or
in
part,
through
either
an
enforcement
action
or
a
settlement.
now,
this
position
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
principles
of
the...
the
common
law,
and
in
particular,
i'd
point
to
the
restatement
third
of
torts,
which
in
comment
23
makes
clear
that
in
order
to
have
contribution,
you
have
to
extinguish
the
underlying
liability.
what's
more,
this
position
also
is...
does
not
discourage
voluntary
settlement.
all
it
requires
is
that
if
a
party
wishes
to
voluntary
clean
up
a
site
and
also
seek
contribution,
then
it
needs
to
reach
a
settlement
with
the
federal
or
state
government
to
ensure
that
the
cleanup
is
going
to
be
done
in
accordance
with
the
national
contingency
plan.
the
national
contingency
plan
is
a
volume
of
federal
regulations
that
specifies
how
cleanups
need
to
be
done.
by
reaching
a
settlement
with
the
federal
government
on...
on
the...
the
details
of
the
cleanup,
it
relieves
a
federal
court
of
having
to
make
that
determination
in
a
contribution
action.
as
it
stands
right
now
in
a
case
such
as
this,
the
federal
court
is
going
to
be
forced
to
make
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
is
compliance
with
the
ncp.
and
that's
a
highly
technical
issue
and
it's
an
issue
that
ought
to
be
addressed
in
the
first
instance
by
the
federal
or
state
officials
who
are
experts
in
these
matters.
as
it
stands
right
now,
if
there
is
no
extinguishment
of
the
underlying
liability,
the
court
is
going
to
have
to...
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
have
to
resolve
these
issues
without
the
guidance
of
those
people
who
are
most
knowledgeable
on
that
very
issue.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
we
assume...
this
is
the...
the
warnings
about
this
site
were
originally
brought
by
the
state
officials,
and
we
assume
that
the
state
officials
would
have
happily
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement
that
would
have
obligated
aviall
to
clean
up
the
site.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
the
state
that
took
notice
of
this
site
would
not
have
been
willing
to
do
so.
and
under
113(f)(3)(b),
an
administrative
settlement
or
a
judicial
settlement
with
the
state
would
entitle
them
to
contribution.
what's
more,
they
can
obtain
contribution
under
state
law.
and
in
fact,
aviall
indicated...
and
it's
cited
at
the
petition
appendix,
page
99a,
that
this
was
primarily
a
contract
action.
the
cercla
action
was
brought
primarily--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
we
think
that
in
the
case...
that
obviously,
epa
has
many
things
on
its
plate.
and
if
the...
there
might
be
cases
where,
in
fact,
the
transaction
costs
are
such
that
epa
will
believe
it
was
better
addressed
by
the
state
rather
than
the
federal
government.
but
in
those
cases
too,
it's
likely
that
a
suit
in
contribution
is
going
to
entail
very
high
transaction
costs
as
well,
and
so
in
those
cases
in
which
contribution
is
most
likely
to
be
sought,
those
cases
that
are
large,
major
settlements,
epa
is
going
to
have
the
highest
incentive
to
pay
attention
to--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that's
absolutely
right.
under
113(f)(3)(b),
if
they
had
entered
into
a
judicial...
administrative
settlement
with
the
state,
that
would
entitle
them
to
contribution.
what's
more,
under
the
state
law,
which
is
texas
health
and
safety
code
361.344(a),
all
they
need
for
state
contribution
is
to
engage
in
a
cleanup
that's
been
approved
by
the
state.
so
there
are
plenty
of
avenues
for
cleanup
in
these
cases
and
for
contribution
through
various
mechanisms.
cercla
is
not
the
only
mechanism
that's
available
here.
and
as
i
pointed
out
before,
the
parties
made
the...
have
stated
this
was
primarily
a
contract
action.
this
began
as
a
contract
action
in
which
cercla
was
only
pled
in
order
to
engage...
to
obtain
federal
court
jurisdiction.
i'd
like
to
address
one
other
issue
here
that's
been
raised
by
the
parties,
and
i
assume
that
respondents
will
raise
that.
and
that
is
the
question
of
federal
cleanup.
and
i
would
point
out
that
cercla
is
only
one
of
many
programs
that
are
provided
to
clean
up
federal
sites.
the
reply
brief
of
petitioner
cites,
for
instance,
the
defense
environmental
reparation
program,
10
u.s.c.
2701,
in
which
congress
directly
appropriates
funds
for
cleaning
up
formerly
used
defense
facilities.
there
are
many
mechanisms
in
which
the
united
states
provides
for
that
cleanup
apart
from
cercla
and
it
does
it
in
cercla
as
well.
thank
you,
your
honor.
