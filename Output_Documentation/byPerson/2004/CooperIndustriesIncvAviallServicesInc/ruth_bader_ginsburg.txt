they...
they
said
that
as
a
matter
of
fifth
circuit
law.
i
think,
is
it
not
true,
that
the
fifth
circuit
says
these
two,
107...
and
what's
the
other?
113.
they're
supposed
to
be
merged
in
one
claim.
i
thought
that
was
fifth
circuit
law
that
the
parties
were
obliged
to
follow.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
they
were
doing
what
the
fifth
circuit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
were
doing
what
the
fifth
circuit
told
them
to
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
can't
fault
a
litigant
for
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understand
it,
this
cleanup
was
initiated
because
the
state
agency
said
you've
got
a
contamination
problem
and
if
you
don't
do
something
about
it,
we're
going
to
enforce
our
law
against
you.
it's
not
that
it
just
was...
we're
dealing...
not
just
dealing
with
a
volunteer.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
one...
was
one
of
those
communications
you're
going
to
do
it,
otherwise
we're
going
to
enforce
our
law
against
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
it's
true
that
the
state
said
you've
got
a
contamination
problem,
cure
it,
why
would
we
want
to
construe
federal
law
as
saying
don't
clean
up
sooner,
wait
until,
say,
epa
goes
after
you?
why
would
it
make
any
sense
to
construe
the
law
that
way?
i...
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
every
reason
why
you
would
want
to
read
it
to
say
clean
up
sooner,
not
later.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
might
be
sitting...
epa
has
got
a
lot
of
things
on
its
agenda.
you
might
sitting...
be
sitting
around
waiting
forever
till
epa
comes
after
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
your...
your
position
correctly
that
a
state
or
a
federal
administrative
order
won't
do
or
a
state
or
federal
threat
of
enforcement
won't
do,
that
the
only
thing
that
will
count
is
a
settlement...
a
signed
settlement
agreement,
whether
it's
between
the
state
administrator
or
the
federal
administrator,
but
just
the...
the
mere
order
that
you
clean
up,
threat
that
we
will
enforce
if
you
don't,
that
that
doesn't
count?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wholly
a
volunteer?
there
was...
there
was
a
state
agency
in
the
picture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
threat
of
enforcement
if
they
didn't
clean
up,
as
i
understand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear,
i
was
just
reading
from
this
government
brief,
which
you
said
is
consistent
with
your
current
position
on
that
point.
the
plain
language
of
cercla
113(f)(1)
is
not
restrictive,
i.e.,
it
does
not
say
that
a
contribution
action
may
only...
you
read
the
word
only.
that's
not
in
the
statute...
be
brought
during
or
following
a
civil
action
under
cercla.
i'm
reading
from
32a
of
the
red
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear...
minear,
i
have
a
practical
question.
it...
it
seems
like
epa
has
higher
priorities,
properly
has
higher
priorities
than...
than
to
be
making
deals
with
each
person
who
wants
to
clean
up
a
contaminated
site.
and
you
said
you
have
to
get
the
settlement.
how
mechanically...
how
easy
it
is...
how
easy
is
it
for
someone
in
the
position
of
aviall
services
to
say,
epa,
we've
been
told
that
we've
got
a
contaminated
site?
cooper
contributed
to
it.
we'd
like
to
get
this
cleaned
up
quickly.
would
you
give
us
a
settlement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as...
i
just
want
to
know
if
it's
a
realistic
choice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say
the
whole...
this
whole
thing
could
have
been
cured
if
aviall
had
followed
up
with
the
state
enforcer
and
said,
give
me
a
settlement
agreement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
state
agency?
i
mean,
the
state
agency
was
telling
you
you
got
a
problem,
clean
it
up.
why
wouldn't
such
an
agency
be
an
easier
place
to
get
a
settlement
from
than
epa?
