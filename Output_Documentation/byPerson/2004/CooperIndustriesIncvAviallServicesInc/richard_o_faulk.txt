mr.
richard
o.
faulk
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
the
very
first
thing
i
want
to
do
is
clear
up
what
i
consider
to
be
the
two
most
persistent
myths
in
this
case.
the
first
one
is
that
we
didn't
bring
a
107
action.
justice
kennedy
asked
about
it.
justice
o'connor
asked
about
it.
we
pleaded
this
case.
i
pleaded
this
case.
i
drafted
the
complaint
in
this
case.
i
drafted
the
fifth
cause
of
action
in
that
case.
and
in
this
case,
we
pleaded
specifically
on
the
very
first
page
of
the
complaint
a
claim
under
107
and
section
113.
when
i
pleaded
the
fifth
cause
of
action,
which
was
liability
under
cercla...
that's
how
it
was
nominated...
i
pleaded
that
this
was
a
cause
of
action
brought
pursuant
to
section
107
and
section
113(f).
now,
why
did
i
do
that?
i
did
that
because
the
controlling
law
of
the
fifth
circuit
at
the
time,
as
justice
ginsburg
recognized,
specified
that
the
cause
of
action
for
contribution
under
cercla
is
derived
from
section
107
in
the
first
place,
and
that
the
mechanism
for
that,
for
bringing
that
cause
of
action
in
certain
circumstances
is
governed
by
section
113.
and
so,
yes,
we
pleaded
a
107
action.
we
do
not
have...
there
is
no
right
of
cost
recovery
under
cercla
by
contribution
or
otherwise.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
i'm
asserting
a
consolidated
claim
under
section
107
and
113,
exactly
as
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--well,
your...
your
honor,
i...
i
would
just
respectfully
disagree
with
the
way--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--i...
i
would
suggest
that's
important,
and
it's
also
important
to
review
the
colloquy
that
we
had
with
the
district
court
when
the
district
court--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--well,
i...
i
drafted
the
amended
complaint,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
the
original
complaint
was
not
the
one
i
originally
drafted.
but
the
actual
cause
of
action
that
was
asserted
in
the
fifth
cause
of
action
i
did,
in
fact,
draft.
the
colloquy
that
went
on
in
the
district
court,
judge
fitzwater
tried
to
pin
me
down
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
had
a
107
cause
of
action,
and
i
very,
very
specifically
cleaved
to
the
idea
that
we
were
asserting
the
blended
cause
of
action
that
was
not
only
recognized
by
the
court
in
geraghty
v.
miller
in
the
fifth
circuit,
it's
also
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
key
tronic
decision,
which
is...
wasn't
even
mentioned
by
my
opponent
during
the
discussion.
but
in
key
tronic,
which
was
a
case
that
involved
the
situation
where
someone
had
brought
a
cause
of
action
trying
to
recover.
a
prp,
a
clear
prp
had
brought
a
cause
of
action
pursuant
to
state
enforcement
to
recover
the
costs
associated
with
it.
this
court
recognized
that
section
113
had
a
cause
of
action,
recognized
the
cause
of
action,
but
that
there
was
a
similar
and
somewhat
overlapping
cause
of
action
within
section
107
for
the
same
relief.
what
we
tried
very
carefully
to
do,
your
honor,
was
to
plead
ourself
into
the
overlap.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
there
has
been
a
specific
ruling.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
your
honor,
and
we
have...
we
have
asserted
that
if
this
court
finds
that,
in
fact,
we're
not
entitled
to
recovery
under
113,
we
should
be
entitled
to
a
remand
to
have
the
issue
of
the
107
issue
resolved.
and
so
we
do
have
that
issue
remaining
to
be
resolved.
let
me
bring
up
the
other
persistent
myth
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
we
engaged
in
a
voluntary
cleanup.
i
realize
the...
the
court's
issue
that
it
phrased
as
it
accepted
the
certiorari
was,
in
fact,
that
there
was
a
voluntary
issue
involved.
aviall
did
not
do
this
voluntarily.
aviall
acted
under
a
directive
of
the...
of
the
state
government
very
specifically
in
a
proceeding
that
we
received
letters
for.
we've
cited
that
in
the
brief.
i
believe
it's
on
page
6.
all
of
the
record
citations
that
show
how
the
state
of
texas
said
clean
this
up
or
else.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not
object
to
it.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
i
understand,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--absolutely,
your
honor.
that
is...
that
is--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--that
is
what
the
first
sentence
says,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
we
fit
ourself
not
within
the
first
sentence--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--of
that
provision
at
all,
your
honor,
but
we
fall
within
the
last
sentence
of
that
provision
because
the...
the
last
sentence
of
that
provision
specifically
provides
that
we
can
pursue
the
right...
not
any
right,
not
multiple
rights,
but
the
singular
right
of
contribution,
which
is
specified
in
that...
in...
in
section
107.
it's...
it's
referring
back
very
clearly
to
107.
it
is
not,
as
the
petitioner
says,
referring
to
state
law.
this
is
not
a
savings
clause
for
state
law.
cercla
already
contains
two
saving
clauses
for
state
law.
congress
surely
knew,
when
they
were
enacting
the
statute,
exactly
how
to
write
a
savings
clause--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--the
right
is
derived
from
section
107
in
the
first
place,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
i'm...
i'm
saying
it...
it
expressly
recognized
and
maintains
and
confirms
the
preexisting
right
under
107,
a
right
that
had
existed
under--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--well,
the
last--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--your...
your
honor,
i...
i
cannot...
i
cannot
explain
the
oddity
of
the
section,
as...
as
i
have
heard
in
some
quarters.
however,
just
because
it's
odd
doesn't
mean
it's
not
plain.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
i
know
what
you're
driving
at,
and
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reply
to
it.
it...
it
really
is...
it
really
is...
we
have
to
look
at
these
sections
together,
but
we
also
have
to
take
a
look
at
the
context
in
which
section
113
was
enacted.
at
the
time
section
113
was
enacted,
the
government
was
proposing
that
contribution
only
be
allowed
to
occur
when
they
brought
an
action
at
the
time
the
judgment
was
rendered.
they
didn't
want
contribution
actions
within
the
context
of
their
own
actions
frustrating
or
slowing
down
the
process
of
enforcement.
and
so
what
happened
was
that
congress
inserted
the
during
action
only
to
govern
the
issue
dealing
with
the
right
of
contribution
when
an
action
was
pending.
congress
did
not--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--well,
one...
one
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
already
two
savings
clauses
specifically
inserted
in
cercla
dealing
with
state
causes
of
action
and
the
rights
of
parties
to
pursue
state
causes
of
action.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
however
admirably
drafted...
and
i...
i
respect
your
honor's
opinion...
the
limitation
of
that
to
state
causes
of
action
is
entirely
inappropriate
given
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
may,
if
the
court
chooses,
be
declared
to
deal
with
state
causes
of
action,
but
there's
no
reason
that
it
excludes
preexisting
federal
causes
of
action.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
i...
i
don't
agree,
your
honor.
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
that's
a...
that's
a
proper
reading,
respectfully,
of
the
statute.
it's
talking
about
the
absence
of
a
107
action
pending
at
the
time
to
say
the
action
is--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--i...
i
think...
to...
to
me,
your
honor,
it's
very
clear.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
it's
definitely
saving
causes
of
action
preexisting
under
107
because
it
uses
the
term,
the
right
of
action,
not
whatever
right
of
actions
exist,
not
any
right
of
action.
it's
specifically
referring
to
a
specific
cause
of
action,
and
the
only
other
cause
of
action--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--well,
it
depends,
your
honor,
how
we...
how
we...
if
we
have
to
go
back
to
key
tronic,
which
i...
i
suspect
we
do,
the
question
of
whether
any
person
is
the
person
entitled
to
bring
a
cause
of
action
under
107,
and
i
think
this
court
has
held
that
that
is
implied
under
section
107.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
will...
i
will
say
that
there
is
absolutely
no
statute
anywhere
like
cercla.
[laughter]
and
i
think
all
of
us
would...
would
agree
with
that.
the...
the
issue
that
you're
trying
to...
that
you're
recognizing
here
is
that
the
statute
is
permissive.
the
statute
is
in
fact
permissive.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
suggests
it's
restrictive.
if,
as
this
court
held,
there
is
a
preexisting
right
of
action
under
107,
then
this
statute
impliedly
repeals
it.
now,
implied
repeals
are
distinctly
disfavored
by
this
court.
it's
certainly
not
consistent
with
the
plain
language
that
some
cause
of
action
that
existed
under
federal
law
prior
to
the
time
cercla
was
enacted
has
been
impliedly
repealed
by
the
statute.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
grant
the
broadest
possible
rights
of
contribution
under
cercla
to
serve
cercla's
goals
and
objects,
and
those
are
twofold.
the
first
is
that
it's
designed
to
facilitate
the
cleanup
of
contaminated
sites.
the
second
is
that
it's
intended
to
hold
persons
responsible
for
the
contamination
responsible.
to
take...
our
interpretation
is
not
at
war
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
petitioner's
is.
under
petitioner's
situation,
there
is
a
clear
loophole.
there
is
a
clear
vacancy
in
the
statute--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--my
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
the
very
purpose
of
cercla,
from
its
inception,
was
to
arm
the
federal
government
and
private
parties
with
powers
sufficient
that
would
motivate
voluntary
cleanup
action
without
federal
involvement.
and
that
would
be
an
antithesis
of
the
goals
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
in
my
experience,
your
honor,
it
is
not
easy
to
do.
you
stand
in
line.
and
the
question
of
standing
in
line
while
contamination
exists
when
you're
within
the
distance
of
a
lake,
at
the
end
of
runways,
near
the
place
where
this
contamination
took
place,
when
you're
in
a
situation
where
there
is
movement
and
concern
with
groundwater--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--your...
your
honor,
the
question
of
both
federal
and
state
agency
assumes
the
resources
and
ability
and
timing
and
staffing
of
the
agencies
to
get
to
the
point,
and...
and
get
it
done
in
an
expedited
way.
i
am
not
saying
that
it
is
not
an
avenue
that
could
be
pursued.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
entire
purpose
of
cercla
was
to
avoid
that.
the
purpose
of
cercla
was
to
get
parties
involved
in
voluntary
cleanup
so
that
this
country
could
have
uncontaminated
sites,
so
this
country
could
have
environmental
protection
and
cleanups
that
serve
the
interests
of--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--your
honor,
i
think
the
language
that
congress
used
clearly
serves
the
same
purposes
and
goals
within
its
plain
language.
we're...
we're
here
under...
if
anyone
is
here
under
the
plain
banner
language
here,
we
are.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
you
have
to
add
the
word
only
to
the
statute
in
order
to
get
to
the
plain
meaning.
we're
not
suggesting
that
you
have
to
add
the
words,
under
state
law,
to
the
statute
to
get
to
the
plain
meaning.
we're
giving
effect
to
every
single
term
in
the
statute,
all
the
way
down
to
the
term
the
in
the
statute,
as
i
previously
expressed.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
i
would--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--your
honor,
i'm
not
reading
anything
out.
i'm
reading
everything
in.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
and
i
think
there's
a
very
big
difference.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
as...
as
the--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--as
the
amicus
briefs
explained,
your
honor,
in
the
arco
brief
at
page
20
and
in
the
dupont
brief
at
page
15,
the...
at
the
time
this
statute
was
being
enacted,
the
purpose
of
adding
during
into
the
statute
was
to
preclude
the
government
from
forcing
people
to
wait
until
after
judgment
was
rendered
to
get
contribution
in
enforcement
actions
because
it
was
the
government's
position...
and
this...
and
the...
and
the
actual
document
from
the
government
is...
is
available
in
the
brief.
it's
house
document
no.
9932
at
page
23.
that
is
the
position
the
government
was
taking,
and
that's
why
that
specific
term
was
added.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
or
follow...
or
following,
your
honor,
was...
was
something
that
was
in
the
bill
to
begin
with.
it
was
added--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--or
following
was
in
the
bill.
they...
they
were
providing
for
the
right
of
contribution
after
judgment,
but
during
was
added
solely
for
the--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--i--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--your
honor,
i
have
to
take
the
words
of
congress
as
they
are,
as...
as
we
all
do.
i
can
only
say
that
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
it's
restrictive.
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
well--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--if
i...
if
i
can
elaborate.
the
first
part
of
the
statute
deals
with
the
rights
of
parties
at
the
time
an
action
is
pending.
the
second
part
of
the
statute,
the
last
sentence
deals
with
the
rights
of
parties
at
the
time
the
action...
before
the
action
has
been
filed.
it
permits
parties
without
federal
involvement
to
do
things
together
in...
without
epa
involvement--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--yes,
your
honor.
i...
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
think
i've
addressed
the...
the
persistent
issues
that
we
have,
but
i
want
to
talk
a
bit
about
the
issue
of
the
may
being
permissive
as
opposed
to
be
mandatory.
i'm
not
going
to
stand
up
here
and
tell
the
court
that
there
aren't
statutes
under
certain
circumstances
where
this
court
hasn't
or
might
not
construe
a
statute
to
be
mandatory,
which
uses
the
word
may.
on
the
other
hand,
may
is...
it's...
that's
not
the
natural
and
normal
and
plain
meaning
of
the
word
in...
in
this
context.
in
this
context,
we
have
a
permissive
statute.
we
have
a
remedial
statute.
we
have
a
statute
that's
intended
to
achieve
a
purpose
that
is
intended
in
a
broad,
remedial
sense.
and
that
purpose
is
consistent
with
the
goals
and
objectives
of
the
statute.
this
court
should
not
consider
the
statute
standing
alone
in
a
vacuum.
one
of
the
problems
i
have
with
the
argument
of
petitioner
here
is
that
they
construe
the
common
law
like
a
statute
and
they
construe
the
statute
like
the
common
law.
they
construe
the
common
law
as
though
it's
rigid,
and
even
though
cercla
says
you
deal
with
the...
not
only
the
law
as
it
existed
at
common
law
in
1980
or
1986,
but
you
deal
with
it
in
an
evolving
basis.
and
it's
very
important--
mr.
richard
o.
faulk
--there...
there
is
a
section
of
the
statute,
and
if
it
comes
to
me
in
a
moment...
it's
in
my
brief
and
it's
cited,
your
honor,
that
you
deal
not
only
with
the
common
law
at
the
time,
but
at
the
time
as
it
evolves.
and
it
specifically
instructs
the
courts,
in
construing
the
statute,
to
deal
with
the
evolving
common
law.
common
law
is
evolving.
common
law
is
based
on
experience
going
back
to
the
old
justice
holmes
quote.
and
we
have
over
20
years'
worth
of
experience
with
this
statute
in
a
system
that
has
worked,
in
a
system
that
is
working
to
achieve
the
purposes
that
cercla
provided.
surely
one
of
the
important
points
in
considering
this
statute
is
whether
or
not
the
interpretation
that
has
been
applied
for
20
years,
that
has
governed
the
settled
expectations
of
the
parties
for
all
this
time,
that
interpretation
should
inform
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
interpretation
we
are
asserting
is
consistent
with
the
law.
and
it
is.
it's
not
at
war
with
the
statute.
petitioner's
interpretation
is
clearly
at
war
with
the
statute.
it
clearly
frustrates
the
parties'
purposes
and
delays
the
expeditious
progress
of...
of
cleanups.
so
if
you're
dealing
with
a
mandatory
or
a
permissive
construction
here,
your
honors,
i
think
the...
the
permissive
construction,
which
achieves
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
is
entirely
permissible
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
however
inartfully
it
may
be
drafted,
is
the
one
that
should
be
chosen.
there
were
a
couple
of
other
points,
if
i
may
bring
them
up.
petitioners
and
the...
the
united
states
government
concede
in
their...
in
their
brief
essentially
that
section
113,
the
last
savings
clause,
preserves
any
right
of
contribution
that
is
separate
and
apart
from
113.
that
refers
to
the
107
cause
of
action.
that
is,
in
fact,
a
matter
of
declaration
in
their
briefs.
so
if
we're
entirely
correct
on
that
point,
then
we
certainly
have
a
right
to
proceed
here,
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
our
interpretation
should
be
followed.
the
purpose
of
what
we're
doing
here
is
to
get
the
federal
government
out
of
the
picture
as
soon
as
possible.
here
we
will
have
a
multiplicity
of
litigation.
people
will
be
going
to
the
federal
government
to
get
orders
from
the
federal
government
because...
and
to
get
the
government
to
sue
them,
only
to
disobey
those
orders,
after
they're
entered,
to
get
the
government
to
sue
them.
there's...
this
artificiality
of
the
system
that
petitioner
is
advocating
here
really
belies
the
entire
purpose
of
congress,
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
under
the
circumstances,
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
because
the
achievements
that
it...
it
wrought
are
in
fact
consistent
with
the
statute's
purpose.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
those
are
the...
my
concluding
remarks.
