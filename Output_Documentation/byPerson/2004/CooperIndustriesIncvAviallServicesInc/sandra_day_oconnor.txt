but
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
what's
going
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
question
is
open,
is
it
not?
i
mean,
even
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
section
113,
why
wouldn't
we
leave
it
open
as
to
whether
aviall
can
go
under
107(a)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
this
case,
has
the
court
below
directly
ruled
on
whether
there's
a
107
cause
of
action
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that's
still
open.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
you
do
admit,
though,
that
no
civil
action
had
been
brought
against
aviall.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
much
is
clear.
and...
and
section
113(f)
says,
any
person
may
seek
contribution
from
any
other
person
during
or
following
any
civil
action
under
106
or
107(a).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
how
do
you
fit
yourself
within
that
provision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
perhaps
congress
should
have
used
different
language.
that's
our
problem.
we
can't
make
it
up.
