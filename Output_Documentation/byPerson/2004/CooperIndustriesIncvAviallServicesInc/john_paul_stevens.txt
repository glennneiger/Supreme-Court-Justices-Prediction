paul

yes,
but
mr.
reynolds,
there's
a
savings
clause,
and...
and
conceivably
one
could
read
the
savings
clause
as
saying
whatever
federal
remedy
was
available
between
1980
and
1986
is
still
available.
and
if
one
read
it
that
way,
then
the
question
would
be,
could
this
very
action
have
been
brought
in
1983
or
4?
and
i
don't
know.
what...
what's
your
answer
to
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
i...
i
agree
with
that.
but
the
question,
though,
is
whether
this
particular
action
would
have
been
recognized
when...
when
these...
when
the...
the
plaintiff
is
a
potentially
responsible
party
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i
agree
not
under
107.
was
there
any
implied
remedy
that
was
not
specifically
covered
by
a
statute
prior
to
1986?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was...
a
contribution
was
implied.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
certainly
true
that
cases
that
they
labeled
contribution
cases
was
exactly
as
you
define
it,
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
there
were
not
in
fact
some
cases
with
facts
just
like
this
one
which,
without
specific
statutory
authorization,
the
judge
found
an
implied
basis
for
allowing
recovery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
minear,
the...
i
think
the
respondent
accuses
the
government
of
changing
its
position
in
this
case.
would
you
tell
me
whether
you
did
change
a...
your
position
at
all,
and
if
so,
what
is
the
difference
between
your
former
position
and
your
present
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
has
been
no
change
in
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whether
there
was
any
change
of
position
and
what
was
it
and
would
you
explain--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
it
was
and
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just...
i
just
reviewed
that
colloquy,
and
there
you
said
you
did
not
draft
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
does
the
right
come
from?
