justice
antonin
scalia
did...
did
you
object
to
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
on
that
ground,
that
the
word
voluntarily
in
it
was...
was
inaccurate?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
we
take
the
questions
that
are
presented
when
the
parties
don't...
don't
object
to
it.
and...
and
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
party
who's
not
been
the
subject
of
an
underlying
civil
action,
blah,
blah,
may
bring
an
action
to
recover
costs
spent
voluntarily
to
clean
up
properties.
that's
what
i
thought
this
case
involved,
and...
and
it's
the
way
i'm
going
to
decide
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
isn't
a
perfectly
adequate
explanation
of
the
last
sentence
that
it
was
referring
to
the
state
causes
of
action?
and
indeed,
you...
you
assert
a
state
cause
of
action
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
would
be
a
very
logical
place
to...
to
repeat
it,
even
if
it
is
somewhere
else.
you're...
you're
creating
a
federal
cause
of
action
under
certain
narrow
conditions,
and
the
last
sentence
says,
nothing
shall
diminish
the
right
of
any
person
to...
in
the
absence
of
a
civil
action.
it
doesn't
say
we're
creating
a
right.
it...
shall
diminish
the
right.
so
if
there
is
any
other
right,
we
do...
this
does
not
preempt
any...
any
state
causes
of
action.
i
think
it's
admirably
drafted.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
be
ashamed
of
how
to
explain
it.
it...
it
explains
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you're...
you're
effectively
reading
out
of
it
the...
the
limitation,
during
or
following
any
civil
action
under
section
9606--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
you're
saying
any
person
may
seek
contribution
during
or
after
and
they
may
also
seek
contribution
any
other
time.
i
mean,
why...
why
have
the
limitation?
you're
just
reading
it
out.
it
makes
no
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
function
does
during
or
following
any
civil
action
under
section
9606
of
this
statute
serve--
justice
antonin
scalia
--given...
given
that
you
believe
the
last
sentence
means
there's
a
cause
of
action
even
when
it's
not
during
or
following
any
civil
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
during.
what
about
or
following?
why
was
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
do
you
need
it?
why
do
you
the
or
following,
at
least,
if
you
have
that
last
sentence--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
says
there's
a
right
of
contribution?
other...
other--
justice
antonin
scalia
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
no.
02-1192,
cooper
industries
versus
aviall
services
will
be
announced
by
justice
