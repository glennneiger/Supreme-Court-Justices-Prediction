justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
understanding
is...
is
right...
is
that
113
says
that
if
there
is
a
civil
action
under
107,
then
you
get
the
contribution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
and
so
then...
and...
and
there
might
be
because
i
was
interested
in...
you
said
that
it's
true
that
the
common
law
rule
was
no
contribution
among
tortfeasors,
but
almost
everywhere
that's
been
changed,
is
my
impression,
either
by
statute
or...
or
perhaps
by
judicial
decision,
so
that
now
you
can
read
the
restatement
of
torts,
and
it
seems
to
say
that
in
most
instances,
for
example,
this
one...
nuisances,
say.
nuisances.
there...
there
would
be
a
right
of
contribution
in...
almost
everywhere
under
not
old
common
law
principles,
but
as
the
law
has...
has
changed
in
the
20th
century.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
i
want
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh,
i
see.
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't...
what
it
says...
in
the
complaint
here
that
i
have,
it
says
pursuant
to
cercla...
then
you
cite
113...
aviall
is
entitled
to
seek
contribution
from
cooper
as
a
person
liable
or
potentially
liable
under
cercla
107.
but
you
don't
say
liable
to
you.
you
don't
say
you're
bringing
it
under
107.
i
mean,
obviously,
they
are
a
person
who's
potentially
liable
under
107,
but
is
that
what
you
mean
by
asserting
a
107
claim?
i
mean,
i
could
go
sue
them
and
claim
they're
a
person
liable
under
107.
anybody
could
in
the
world,
and
is
that
what
you're
doing
there,
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
say
they
are
a
person
who's
liable
under
107.
you
say
you're
bringing
the
action
under
107?
no.
you
say
you're
bringing
it
under
113.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
i
see.
but
i
have
the
right
language
anyway,
and
i
better
read
it
again
is
your
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says,
nothing
in
this
subsection
shall
diminish
the
right
of
any
person
to
bring
an
action
for
contribution
in
the
absence
of
a
section...
in
the
absence.
now,
does
that
create
the
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
argument
is
that
the
first
sentence
says
that
you
or
anybody
can
get
contribution
following
or
during
a
civil
action
under
107.
and
then
the
last
sentence
means
anybody
can
get
a
right
for
contribution
any
other
time
as
well.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
isn't
much
of
a
section.
i
mean,
it's
sort
of
interesting
what
it's
trying
to
do
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but
in
your
view
that's
how
we
should
read
it.
we
should
read
it
as
if
it
said
if
you
want
$1,000,
go
at
a
certain...
go
any...
sorry.
you
understand
what
i'm
driving
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
got
any
other
statute
like
this?
i...
the...
it's
sort
of
like...
i
have
found
my
example.
you
see
in
the
newspapers
sometime,
if
you
present
this
coupon
to
brooks
brothers,
they'll
give
you
a
20
percent
discount.
and
then
it
says,
and
if
you
don't
present
the
coupon,
we'll
give
you
a
20
percent
discount.
[laughter]
so
it's
sort
of
like
that,
as
you're
reading
it.
and...
and
i...
i
find
it
hard
to
think
of
any
other
example
in
the
statute
books
that's
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
point
is
it's
emphasis.
is
that
what
it
is?
it's
emphasis
because
in
fact
during
or
after,
the
word
during
adds
nothing.
the
word,
or
after,
adds
nothing.
if
you
give
the
last
sentence
the
reading
you're
giving
it,
that
you
say
in
the
historic
circumstance
where
everybody
was
fighting
about
this,
congress
put
it
in
really
to
emphasize
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
is
that
basically
the
point?
because
they
were
fighting
the
department
of...
whoever,
the
doj
or
somebody
who
had
a
different
view
of
it
and
they
wanted
to
emphasize
it.
