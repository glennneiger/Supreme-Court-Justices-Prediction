anthony
m.
kennedy
it's...
it's
aviall's
complaint,
not
yours,
so
i
can
ask
them.
but
what...
what's
your
understanding
or...
or
best
conclusion
as
to
why
they
didn't
sue
under
107?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
why
they
did
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
had
thought
that
the
district
court
all
but
invited
them
to...
to
state
a
107
cause
of
action,
and
they
didn't
accept
the
district
judge's
invitation,
as...
as
i
read
the
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you...
do
you
think
there's
a
107
action
by
one
prp
against
another?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
in...
what
about
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
you're...
if
you're
going
to
take
the
position
below
that
a
prp
can't
sue,
then
maybe
that
would
have
some
bearing
on
how
we'd
interpret
113.
