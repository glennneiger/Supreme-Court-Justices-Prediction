justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner
owned
four
aircraft
engine
maintenance
facilities
in
texas
until
1981
when
it
sold
them
to
respondent.
respondent
operated
the
sites
for
several
years
and
then
discovered
that
both
it
and
petitioner
had
contaminated
them
with
hazardous
substances.
respondent
notified
the
texas
environmental
authorities
of
the
contamination.
the
state
directed
respondent
by
letter
to
clean
up
the
sites,
but
neither
the
state
nor
the
federal
government
took
judicial
or
administrative
measures
to
compel
the
clean
up.
ultimately,
respondent
cleaned
up
the
properties
under
the
state's
supervision
incurring
significant
cost.
respondent
filed
this
action
against
petitioner
under
the
comprehensive
environmental
response
compensation
and
liability
act,
commonly
referred
to
as
cercla,
seeking
to
recoup
its
costs.
in
particular,
respondent
asserted
a
claim
under
cercla's
contribution
provision,
section
113(f)(1).
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
petitioner
holding
that
respondent
could
not
sue
under
section
113(f)(1)
because
it
had
not
been
subject
to
a
civil
action
under
cercla's
section
106
or
107.
a
divided
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
on
rehearing
en
banc,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
by
a
divided
vote
holding
that
a
voluntary
remediator
such
as
respondent
could
seek
contribution
under
section
113(f)(1),
even
though
it
had
not
been
subject
to
a
section
106
or
107
civil
action.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
the
first
sentence
of
section
113(f)(1)
provides
as
relevant
"any
person
may
seek
contribution
during
or
following
any
civil
action
under
section
106
or
under
section
107(a)
of
cercla."
the
natural
meaning
of
"may"
in
this
sentence
is
that
it
authorizes
certain
contribution
actions
that
satisfy
the
specified
condition
during
or
following
a
civil
action
and
no
others.
reading
the
sentence
to
authorize
contribution
actions
at
any
time
regardless
of
the
existence
of
a
civil
action
would
render
the
during
or
following-condition
entirely
superfluous.
the
last
sentence
of
section
113(f)(1)
which
provides
"nothing
in
this
subsection
shall
diminish
the
right
of
any
person
to
bring
an
action
for
contribution
in
the
absence
of
a
civil
action
under
section
106
or
107
does
not
change
our
conclusion."
that
sentence
does
not
itself
establish
a
cause
of
action,
nor
does
it
expand
section
113(f)(1)
to
authorize
contribution
actions
not
brought
during
or
following
a
civil
action,
nor
does
it
specify
what
causes
of
action
for
a
contribution,
if
any,
exist
outside
section
113(f)(1).
in
short,
section
113(f)(1)
does
not
support
respondent's
suit.
respondent
contends
that
it
may
also
recover
cost
under
section
107(a)(4)(b).
we
decline
to
address
the
issue.
first,
there
is
a
question
whether
respondent
waived
its
section
107
claim
below.
second,
the
merits
of
the
section
107
claim,
if
not
waived,
were
not
decided
below
or
briefed
in
this
court.
they
deserve
full
consideration
in
their
own
right.
we
also
decline
to
decide
whether
respondent
has
an
implied
right
to
contribution
under
section
107
distinct
from
a
right
to
cost
recovery.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
joins.
