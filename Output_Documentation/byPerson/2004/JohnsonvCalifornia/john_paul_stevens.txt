justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
johnson
against
california.
mr.
deixler.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
deixler,
do
you
think
you
lose
if
we
apply
turner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
isn't
that
the
right
approach
to
the
case
then
if
that's
the...
we
don't
have
to
meddle
with
the
rules
governing
the...
the
conduct
of
prisons,
if
you
can
prevail
under
that
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clement,
will
you
tell
us
how
the
government
would
come
out
applying
the
turner
analysis
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
concerned
about
evaluating
prison
race
policies.
are
there
any
other
prison
policies
in
the
country
that
adopt
a
racial
test
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr....
ms.
grunder.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
initial
placing
of
two
inmates
in
the
same
cell
has
ever
had...
has
ever
produced
a
racial
incident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you've
never
tried
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
applies
in
the
reception
center
area
for
someone
who
has
been
transferred
as
well
as
the...
an
initial
incarceration.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
what's
probably
a
stupid
question?
we're
concerned,
i
suppose,
about
say,
a
black
prisoner
who's
just
coming
into
prison
for
the
first
time
and
you
hope
he
won't
join
one
of
the
black
gangs.
so
wouldn't
the
safest
thing
to
do
for
the
first
20
days
is
to
put
him
with
a
cellmate
who's
not
black?
justice
john
paul
stevens
between
the
gangs.
but
i'm
assuming
a
new
prisoner
who
you
have
no
information
about.
do
you
presume
he's
a
member
of
a
gang
or
presume
he's
somebody
who
may
not
be
a
member
of
a
gang?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
he's
not
a
member
of
the
gang,
isn't
the
danger
that
he'll
become
affiliated
with
the
gang
increased
by
insisting
on
putting
him
with
the
same
race
as...
as
he
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
you...
you
have
never...
no
evidence
that
that's
ever
happened
because
you've
never
tried
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
still
seems
to
me
that
a
new
inmate
is
more
likely
to
be
subjected
to
that
pressure
with
the...
his
cellmates
than
with
somebody
out
in
the
yard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
seems
to
me
insurance
against
him
joining
a
racial
gang
is
cell...
cell
him
with
somebody
who's
not
of
the
same
race.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question
about
the...
the
purpose
you're
trying
to
achieve?
is
it
to
protect
the
two
inmates
who
are
first
celled
together
from
fighting
with
one
another,
or
is
it
to
avoid
the
danger
that
one
of
them
will
somehow
start
a
riot
later
on
in...
in
the
general
prison
population?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
i
want
to
ask
one
other
question.
you...
you
mentioned
the
texas
system
and
you
discussed
it
in
your
brief.
is
that
correct?
i
didn't
find
it
in
your
discussion
as
to
the
texas
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms.
grunder.
mr.
deixler,
you
have
about
3
and
a
half
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
deixler.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
o’connor
has
the
opinion
to
announce
in
johnson
against
california.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
one
of
the
things,
it
seems
to
me,
you're
all
overlooking
is
that
if
it's
as
obvious
as
they're
all
blind,
those
would
be
challenges
for
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we're
talking
about
challenges
where
there
are
no...
no
obvious
basis
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
confess
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
the
discussion
of
the
trial
strategy
because
is
it
not
correct
that
whenever
the
judge
thinks
step
one
has
been
met,
the
prosecutor
always
answers
the
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well...
well,
whatever
it
is,
he...
generally
they
are
not
silent
when
the
judge
says
i
think
step
one
has
been
met.
i
want
to
be
sure
understand
california's
position
on
one
point.
is
it
your
view
in...
in
california
that
the
judge
must
decide
himself
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that...
that
discrimination
is
present
before
you
proceed
to
step
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
that
is
not
the
test
in
an
ordinary
tort
case
in
california,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
an
ordinary
tort
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
the
judge,
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
says
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
is,
but
there
is
enough
evidence
here
to
submit
to
the
jury,
so
i'm
going
to
overrule
the
motion
for
judgment...
judgment
at
the
end
of
the
case.
now,
that's
a
different
test
than
you
say
is
appropriate
under
batson,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you...
so
you
have
two...
in
california
you
have
two
definitions
of
a
prima
facie
case,
one
for
batson
and
one
for
all
normal
tort
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
not
true
that
the
definition
that
your
opponent
asks
for
is
the
same
definition
that
would
apply
in
tort
litigation
in
california
and
in
most
states
of
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
asking
for
a
special
rule
for
california's
application
of
batson.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
would
be
the
same
rule
if
it
was
a
bench
trial.
the
judge
could
say
to
him...
say,
i
think
you
may
have
enough
but
i'm
not
100
percent
sure
yet.
i'd
like
to
hear
the
defense...
hear
the
rest
of
the
case.
he
doesn't...
it
does
not
really...
the...
the
definition
of
a
prima
facie
case
does
not
depend
on
whether
it's
a
jury
trial
or
a
bench
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
in
avoiding
that
chill,
you're
in
effect
saying
the
prosecutor
is
entitled
to
one
or
two
free
discriminatory
challenges.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
batson
against
california,
a
case
decided
in
1986,
established
a
three-step
procedure
for
determining
whether
a
prosecutor’s
peremptory
challenges
of
prospective
jurors
were
motivated
by
racial
bias.
first,
the
defendant
must
make
a
showing
that
the
relevant
facts
raise
an
inference
of
discrimination.
second,
if
they
do,
the
burden
shifts
to
the
prosecutor
to
offer
a
race-neutral
explanation
for
his
peremptory
strikes.
third,
the
court
must
then
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
record
whether
the
prosecutor
engaged
in
purposeful
discrimination.
the
narrow
question
in
this
case
concerns
the
quantum
of
evidence
that
defendants
must
provide
at
step
one.
petitioner,
an
african
american,
was
convicted
of
second-degree
murder
and
assault
on
a
white
child.
his
jury
was
all
white
because
the
prosecutor
used
three
peremptory
challenges
to
remove
all
three
african
americans
from
the
jury
pool.
petitioner’s
counsel
objected
that
the
strikes
were
unconstitutionally
based
on
race.
the
trial
judge,
however,
did
not
ask
the
prosecutor
to
explain
his
motives.
instead,
the
judge
reviewed
the
record
on
his
own
and
concluded
that
petitioner
had
not
demonstrated
a
strong
likelihood
that
the
peremptory
challenges
were
based
upon
group
bias.
the
california
intermediate
court
of
appeals
reversed
but
the
state
supreme
court
agreed
with
the
trial
court
holding
that
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case,
the
defendant
must
present
sufficient
evidence
to
establish
that
it
was
more
likely
than
not,
that
the
prosecutor
was
motivated
by
discriminatory
purpose
before
the
judge
needed
to
ask
for
an
explanation
of
this
motive
in
exercising
the
peremptory
challenges.
we
granted
certiorari
because
the
court's
interpretation
of
batson
conflicted
with
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
we
now
hold
that
the
ninth
circuit’s
interpretation
is
the
correct
one
and
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court.
as
we
explained
in
greater
detail
in
an
opinion
filled
with
the
clerk,
step
one
of
batson
merely
requires
the
defendant
to
produce
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
plausible
inference
that
discrimination
has
occurred.
if
the
defendant’s
evidence
establish
such
an
inference,
it
is
inappropriate
to
rely
on
mere
speculation.
instead,
the
trial
judge
should
simply
ask
the
prosecutor
to
explain
his
actual
justifications
for
the
strikes.
batson’s
burden
shifting
framework
should
promote
the
public
purpose
of
eradicating
discrimination
from
our
civic
institutions
and
eliminating
the
perception
that
the
trial
has
been
infected
by
discrimination
in
the
jury
selection
process.
in
this
case,
the
california
supreme
court
acknowledged
that
it
certainly
looked
suspicious
that
all
three
african
american
prospective
jurors
were
removed
from
the
jury.
that
inference
that
discrimination
may
have
occurred
where
sufficient
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
under
batson
and
to
require
an
explanation
from
the
prosecutor.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
