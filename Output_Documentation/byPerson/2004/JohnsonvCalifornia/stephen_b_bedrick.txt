mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
three
points.
one,
the
correct
prima
facie
standard
under
batson
is
whether
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
permit
a
judge
to
draw
a
reasonable
inference
of
discrimination.
two,
the
challenger's
own
reasons
must
be
disclosed
in
order
for
the
batson
process
to
work
and
to
prevent
discrimination.
three,
it
is
improper
for
a
third
party
to
speculate
at
the
prima
facie
stage
as
to
a
challenger's
possible
reason
because
what
needs
to
be
evaluated
is
the
challenger's
own
reason
and
own
credibility
and
own
demeanor,
and
not
someone
else's
guess
as
a
reason.
the
correct
prima
facie
test
is
a
permissive
inference
test
where
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
allow
a
judge
to
draw
a
reasonable
inference
of
discrimination.
that's
equivalent
to
the
test
where
a
judge
decides
whether
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
pass
a
case
to
the
jury,
although
i'd
like
to
add
one
small
proviso
to
that,
which
is
in
case
of
doubt,
the
benefit
should
go
in
the
direction
of
obtaining
the
reason
because
the
goals
of
batson
cannot
properly
be
enforced
unless
the
reason
for
the
challenge...
the
challenge
is
stated.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i'm...
i'm
not
suggesting
it
be
watered
down,
your
honor.
i'm
just
suggesting
in
case
of
a
tie,
in
case
the
judge
finds
the
question
is
in
equipoise,
then
there
should...
the
benefit
should
go
to
the...
obtaining
the
reason
and
therefore
obtaining
a...
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
no,
your
honor.
the
test
for
going
to
the
jury
is
actually
higher.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
guess
i
had
the
benefit
of
the
argument
before
the
court
last
year
and
the
benefit
of
further
reflection,
and
i
think
that
allowing
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury
is
a
good
standard
except
for
my
proviso
that
if
it
was
close
and
the...
was
in
equipoise,
then
the
benefit
ought
to
go
to
obtaining
the
reason
because
it
is
a
discovery-type
request.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
the
tie
goes
here
to...
the
standard
would
be
fine
with...
with
or
without
the
benefit
of
a
tie.
i
would
be
happy
with
the
standard
either
way.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
the
standard
under
title
vii
is
something
less,
your
honor,
because
under
title
vii,
under
mcdonnell
douglas,
the
plaintiff
has
to
prove
four
factors,
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
member
of
a
protected
group,
protected
minority
group;
that
the
plaintiff
was
qualified
for
a
job
and
applied;
that
the
plaintiff
was
rejected;
and
that
the
position
stayed
open.
those
four--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--it's
a
parallel...
it's
based
on
mcdonnell
douglas
in
the
sense
that...
that
there's
a
parallel
step
of
prima
facie
case,
shifting
the
burden
of
production.
the
defendant
or
respondent
comes
up
with
an
answer,
and
then
eventually
the
trier
of
fact
decides
whether
or
not
the...
the
plaintiff
or
the
moving
party
has
been
persuasive.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
we
have--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--that's
about
four
questions,
your
honor.
if
i
can
take
them
one
at
a
time.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
the
trial...
if
the
state
refuses,
wilfully
refuses
to
present
an
answer,
the
trial
court
could
and
most
likely
will,
draw
an
inference
from
that
intentional
refusal
and
hold
that
inference
against
the
state.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes.
the...
if...
if
there
is
a--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
very
much
so,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
the...
the
standard
for...
i
believe
the
standard
we're
asking...
that's...
that's
why
i
said
the
standard
of
sending
the
case
to
the
jury
but
with
the
benefit
of
a
doubt
going
to
the...
obtaining
the
reason.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
at
step
one,
whether
or
not
there's
a--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
the
court
considers
the
plaintiff's
showing
of
a
prima...
the...
the
objector's
showing
a
prima
facie
case.
the
court
considers
the
answer
given
by
the
challenger.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
if...
if...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
misunderstood.
i
didn't
realize
it
was
a
silence
issue.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
if
there's
a
prima
facie
case
and
if
the
prosecutor
or
the
challenger
wilfully
refuses
to
answer,
the
trial
judge
is
entitled
to
draw
an
inference
from
that
refusal
to
answer
and
i
believe
most
likely
would
draw
the
inference
that
there's
something
wrong
here
and
therefore
would
find
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
do
not
know,
your
honor,
because
we
have
never
seen
a
situation
in
which
a--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--prosecutor
has
refused
to
answer.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
it's
not
correct
for
the
trial
judge
to
speculate
as
to
the
prosecutor's
possible
reasons.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i...
i
agree,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
what
the
basis
would
be
either
if
a
prima
facie
case--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--i...
i...
the
only
words
that
would
differ
would
be
got
to.
i
would
say
he'd
be
most
likely
to
if
there
were--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--i
believe
that
it...
it
would
require...
that
he
would
ultimately
uphold
the
challenge
but
on
the
basis
of
drawing
an
inference
from
the
refusal
to
answer,
and
those
two...
adding
two
and
two
together,
adding
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--alright,
in
the
case
of
don't
remember,
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--batson
has
been
the
law
for
18
or
19
years.
in
california,
we've
had
wheeler
for
25
years.
any
competent
prosecutor
who
was
challenging
minority
jurors
and
was
faced
with
a
batson
motion
would
make
notes
of
some
kind
and
keep
a
record
of
some
kind.
if
he
did
not
do
that,
he
would
not
be
acting
competently
and
the
trial
court
would
be
entitled
to
draw
an
inference
from
that
claim,
refusing
to
remember.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
the...
the
title
vii
test
and
the
batson
test
are
parallel,
but
not
identical.
and
in
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--the
trial...
the
trial
court
would
find
for
the
plaintiff
because
under
the
title
vii
formula,
which
this
court
has
established
in
the
mcdonnell
douglas/furnco
line
of
cases,
the
finding
of
a
prima
facie
case
entitles
the
plaintiff
to
a
presumption.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
and
it's
bursting
the
bubble--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--slightly--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--the
employer
will
always
give
a
reason
and
the
challenger
will
always
give
a
reason
because
of--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
believe
in
the
title
vii
context
the
judge
would
direct
the
verdict
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
accept
the
suggestion
from
the
court
that
the
standard
could
also
be
reason
to
inquire.
we
would
be...
we
would
be
happy
with
that
standard.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
and
the
batson
procedure
would
work.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
it
means
when
there
is
the
purpose
of--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
no,
not
any
suspicion
whatsoever.
it's
a
higher
standard--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--it
has
to
be
reason
to
inquire.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
it
would
vary
depending
on
the
circumstances.
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--that's
essentially
what
step
one
of
batson
is--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
but
title
vii
doesn't
quite
work
because
the...
the
prima...
the
definition
for
prima
facie
case
in
title
vii
is
different,
and
it's
easier.
if
we
were
to
put
in
the...
they're...
they're
parallel
tests.
they're
not
identical.
if
we
were
to
import
the
title
vii
prima
facie
case
in
a
batson,
it
will
be
satisfied
every
time
there
was
a
challenge
to
a
minority
juror
because
under
any...
every
such
situation,
there
would
be
a
minority
juror
who
was
qualified
and
passed
for
cause
who
was
rejected
and
the
seat
would
be
open.
that
would
be...
that's
a...
that's
even
a
lower
standard
than
we
are--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
my
position.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
an
example...
the
only
example
that
i
can
think...
the
only
practical
example
that
i
can
think
of,
however,
where
a
trial
court
is
likely
not
to
draw
a
strong
negative
inference
from
the
prosecutor's
failure
to
answer
is
in
the
situation
suggested
where
it
reviews
it...
reviewed
it
on
appeal
and
the
prosecutor
died.
under
those
circumstances,
the...
maybe
there...
there
may
be
notes
in
the
file,
but
if
there
aren't
notes
in
the
file,
the
prosecutor's
failure
to
answer
is
beyond
his
control.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes,
your
honor,
in
my
view
it
is.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
the...
i
believe
the
california
court
has
misread
title
vii
practice
in
several
ways.
i
believe
it
has...
it
misread
what
is
produced
at
the...
it
has
misread
what
the
plaintiff's
burden
is
to
produce
a
prima
facie
case.
and
under
title
vii,
the
plaintiff's
burden
is
merely,
as
i
stated,
to
show
that
a
member
of
a
protected
group
qualified,
applied,
rejected,
position
open.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
the...
those
facts
under
title
vii
must
be
proved
more
likely
than
not.
and
from
that,
under
the
title
vii
mcdonnell
douglas
formula--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
under...
under
batson.
the
tests
are
not
identical.
here...
i'm
sort
of
stumbling
over
my
tongue
a
bit
in
trying
to
point
out
that
the
tests
are
parallel
but
they
are
not
identical.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
it
is--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--your
honor,
that's
a...
in
that
example,
which
i
respectfully
submit
would
be
rather
extreme
and
unusual,
the
trial
judge
should
still
not
speculate.
the
reason
why
the
trial
judge
should
not
speculate
is
shown
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
with
regard
to
juror
sara
edwards,
the
trial
judge
speculated
on
two
possibly
reasons.
one
possibly
reason
was
that
she
had
a
relative
who
had
been
arrested
for
a
serious
crime
35
years
ago,
and
the
second
reason
that
he
speculated
was
that
she
had...
was...
did
not
know
whether
she
could
be
fair
in
the
case
of
a
death
of
a
child.
as
to
the
second
reason,
that
would
show...
if
any
bias,
that
would
show
pro-prosecution
bias.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
in
presenting
a
test...
in
presenting
a
test
or
significant
formula,
every
once
in
a
while
there
will
be
a
case
where
this
test
is
slightly
over-inclusive.
and
your
honor
has
given
an
example
of
that.
but
if
that's
the
case,
the
trial
judge
will
say,
you
know,
i
bet
i
know
what
the
answer
is.
mr.
prosecutor,
what's
the
answer?
the
prosecutor
gives
the
answer.
the
trial
judge
says,
yes,
i
find
that
credible.
motion
denied.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
very
much
so,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes.
the
minuet
may...
may...
will
be
most
likely
at
a
bench
conference.
in
this
case
the
two
motions
were
discussed.
one
was
discussed
during
a
jury
recess.
the
other
was
discussed
the
next
morning
before
the
jury
was
assembled.
so
it
may
be
a
minuet,
but
it's
a...
i'm
not
sure
who
the...
there's
a
1-minute
waltz.
so
it
is
more
like
a
1-minute
waltz
than
a
full
minuet.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
because
under
batson
and
then
under
purkett
v.
elem
and
under
hernandez
v.
new
york,
this
court
has
declared
that
batson
is
a
rule
of
federal
constitutional
law,
that
the
purpose
of
batson
is
to
protect
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
the
jurors
to
equal
protection
and
not
being
perempted
for
racial
reasons.
in--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--the
california--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--the
california
supreme
court
made
no
claim
to
be
deciding
this
case
under
state
rules
of
procedure.
it
asserted
repeatedly
that
in
this
case
that
it
was
deciding
this
question
under
its
understanding
of
federal
law,
under
its
understanding
of
the
batson
line
of
cases,
and
that
it
was
interpreting
federal
law
and
nothing
more.
my
opponent
argues
that
there
should
be
a
state
law
question,
but
that's
a
different
position
than
taken
by
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
no,
your
honor.
i
respectfully
disagree.
this
is...
i
believe
this
is
a
question
of
federal
constitutional
law
that
needs
to
be
applied
everywhere.
this
is
a
rule
followed
in
12...
all
12
federal
district...
circuits
and
in
48
of
the
50
states.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions,
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
here
the
prosecutor
perempted
all
three
black
jurors
and
left
a
black
defendant
to
be
tried
by
an
all-white
jury
in
a
racially
tinged
case.
these
facts
indisputably
present
an
inference
of
discrimination.
the...
my
opponent
suggests
that
silence
may
be
a
strategic
decision.
but
we
have
yet
to
locate
any...
any
case
where
any
prosecutor
anywhere
in
a
situation
remotely
like
this
has
chosen
silence
as
the
proper
strategy.
the
purpose
of
batson
is...
is
to
elicit
reasons
from
the
prosecutor
and
then
for
the
trial
court
to
evaluate
those
reasons
and
determine
whether
or
not,
looking
at
the...
all
the
circumstances
and
the
prosecutor's
credibility
and
the
type
of
case,
whether
or
not
their
challenge
is
race-based.
reasons
are
crucial.
in
the
appendix
to
our
opening
brief,
we
examined
84
cases
in
the
last
couple
years
where
discrimination
was
found
in
violation
of
batson.
in
virtually
all
of
these
cases,
the
decision
turned
on
the
evaluation
of
the
articulated
reason.
in
some
of
those,
the
articulated
reason
was
unsupported
by
the
record.
from
that,
there
was
an
inference
and
a
finding
of
discrimination.
in
others
of
those,
the
articulated
reason
applied
to
many
white
jurors
who
were
not
challenged.
all
those
facts
existed
here.
the
goals
of
batson,
which
are
admirable
and
important,
which
should
apply
in
all
50
states,
not
just
in
48,
require...
need
the
reasons
to
be
elicited
because
batson
won't
work
unless
reasons
are
known
and
examined
and
ruled
on
on
the
merits
and
a
record
is
made.
we'd
ask
this
court
to
bring
california
into
the
mainstream
and
ask
that
reasons
be
called
for
in
california
under
the
same
standard
that
they're
called
for
everywhere
else.
