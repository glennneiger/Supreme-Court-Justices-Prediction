justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
california
the
only
state,
to
your
knowledge,
to
apply
this
procedure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
first
amendment
rights.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
is
a
terribly
important
set
of
rights
for
individuals,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why...
why
does
that
affect
the
turner
analysis?
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
you
told
us
earlier
it
wouldn't
survive
turner.
i...
i
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
grunder,
is
this
policy
a...
an
unwritten
policy
of
california?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
an
admitted
practice
but
not
written.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is...
does
any
other
state
have
such
a
policy,
written
or
otherwise?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
texas'
policy?
is
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--ms.
grunder,
do
you
agree
with
opposing
counsel
that
even
if
evaluated
under
the
turner
rule,
properly
applied,
that
california's
policy
would
not
survive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
california
department
of
corrections
has
an
unwritten
policy
of
racially
segregating
prisoners
in
double
cells
in
reception
centers
for
up
to
60
days
each
time
they
enter
a
new
correctional
facility.
during
that
time,
prison
officials
evaluate
inmates
to
determine
their
ultimate
placement.
the
claim
is
that
this
system
of
segregation
is
necessary
to
prevent
violence
caused
by
racial
gangs.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
garrison
johnson,
is
an
african-american
inmate
in
the
california
correctional
system.
he
has
been
incarcerated
since
1987
in
a
number
of
prison
facilities.
upon
his
arrival
at
each
facility,
johnson
has
been
double-celled
with
another
african-american
inmate.
johnson
filed
suit
alleging
that
california’s
policy
violated
his
right
to
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
assigning
him
cellmates
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
state
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
under
the
deferential
standard
of
review
which
we
adopted
in
turner
versus
safley
for
prison
administration.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
ninth
circuit’s
judgment.
we
hold
that
strict
scrutiny
is
the
proper
standard
of
review
for
johnson’s
constitutional
challenge
to
california’s
policy.
we
have
held
repeatedly
that
all
racial
classifications
imposed
by
the
government
must
be
analyzed
by
reviewing
court
under
so-called
strict
scrutiny.
under
that
test,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
racial
classifications
are
narrowly
tailored
measures
that
further
compelling
governmental
interest.
we
insist
on
strict
scrutiny
because
racial
classifications
raise
special
fears
of
motivation
by
invidious
purpose,
and
strict
scrutiny
enables
courts
to
smoke
out
any
illegitimate
uses
of
race.
the
more
deferential
standard
of
review
articulated
in
turner
versus
safley
is
too
lenient
for
this
purpose.
we
do
not
decide
the
constitutionality
of
california’s
policy
today.
we
remand
for
the
lower
courts
to
decide
that
question
after
applying
the
proper
standard.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
scalia
has
joined;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
joined
by
justices
souter
and
breyer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
the
standard
under
title
vii
when
we
talk
about
that,
when
we
talk
about
enough
evidence
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof?
is
that
something
less?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in...
in
batson,
i
guess
the
opinion
for
the
court
suggested
that
it
was
basing
it
on
the
title
vii
cases,
the
mcdonnell
douglas
formula.
is
that
right
or
not?
or
have
we
gone
beyond
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
california
court
at
least
appears
to
say
it's
the
same.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
sounds
like
you
are
in
that
it's
a
tougher
standard
than
normal.
here
you
had
a
situation,
did
you
not,
where
there
were
three
black
prospective
jurors
and
the
prosecutor
struck
all
three?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
could
that
present
enough
evidence
that
the
fact
finder,
if
it
were
referred
to
the
fact
finder,
could
find
a
batson
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why
is
that
not
enough
to
satisfy
the
standard
to
require
the
prosecutor
to
give
an
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
because
the
judge
could
imagine
reasons
that
the
prosecutor
might
have
had?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
your
answer
here
be
exactly
the
same
if
there
had
been
12
african
american
prospective
jurors
and
all
12
were
struck?
does
that
make
a
difference?
