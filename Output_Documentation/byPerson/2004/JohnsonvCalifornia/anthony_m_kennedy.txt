justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the
statistics
showed
that
there
were...
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
have
it
right
at
my
fingerprints...
fingertips...
only
about
200,000
processing
incidents
a
year,
200,000
people
a
year
to
be
processed.
i
take
it
that
includes
some
people
that
are
being
transferred?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you
were
to
prevail
in
this
case
and
a
court
were
to
enter
a
decree
forbidding
this
practice.
a
month
later,
there
is
an
incident
in
which
one
prisoner
is
seriously
injured
in
a...
in
a
prison
cell
because
of
the
interracial
assignment
policy.
would
that
be
grounds
for
rethinking
the
decree?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you
have
a
population
in
which
50
percent
of
all
the
members
of
a
particular
race
are
a
member
of
a...
of
a
gang,
a
gang
such
as
we've
read
about
in...
in
the
record,
bloods,
crips,
et
cetera.
50
percent
are
members
of
the
gang.
would
that
allow
you
to
segregate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
that
because
you
don't
equate
race
gangs
with
race
animosity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
because
it
does
seem
to
me
that
part
of
your
submission,
or
at
least
an
inference
that
i
drew,
was
that
race-based
gangs
do
not
constitute
race-based
threats.
am
i
right
in
saying
that
that's
your
submission?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
the
inference
that
the...
which
inference?
that
they
are
or
are
not
a
threat?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--assume
that
a
gang
poses
an
interracial
threat?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
asked...
i
asked
about
gang
membership.
can
gang
membership
be
equated
with
an
interracial
threat
in
any
significant
number
of...
of
gangs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
now...
now
suppose...
i
didn't
mean
to
intrude
on
justice
breyer,
but
just
following
this
question,
suppose
that
50
percent
of
all
the
inmate
population
in
a
particular
small
prison
is
a
member
of
one
of
these
gangs.
then
could
you
segregate
on
account
of
race?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when...
when...
there's
a
transferee
from
prison
a
to
prison
b
and
he
goes
to
the
reception
center.
does
that
transferee
get
housed
with
other
transferees
or
is
he
also
housed,
from
time
to
time
or
often,
with
new
entrants
into
the
system?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
as
to
one-half
of
the
people
in
that...
in
that
instance,
you
don't
know
what
the
other
inmate's
record
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that...
that
same
argument
could
have
made
in...
in
arguing
about
racial
segregation
in
the
schools
and...
and
in
the
military
and
everything
else.
that's...
that's
not
an
acceptable
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i...
this
may...
may
be
important
to
me
for
understanding
your
argument.
i...
i
didn't
quite
understand
the
hypothetical.
you...
you
want
him
to
keep
the
place
in
line
or
it's
dangerous
for
him
to
keep
the
place
in
line?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
test
for
going
to
the
jury
the
same
as
the
test
for
whether
or
not
discovery
can
proceed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm...
i'm
surprised
you
set
the
bar
that
high.
if
we're
going
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
you
going
to
say
that
if...
if
there's
no
answer,
then
the
challenge
is
presumed
to
be
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
the
trial
judge
can...
can
overrule
the
challenge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
different
from
the
standard
that
requires
it
go
to
the
jury.
you
send
a
case
to
a
jury
if
there's
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
find
for
the
plaintiff.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's...
it...
it
seems
to
me
that's
a...
that's
much
more
rigorous
than
the
standard
that
you've
proposed
in...
in
your
brief,
and
that...
and
that
other
courts
use
in
the
batson
case.
the
batson
inquiry,
as...
as
i
understand
it,
is...
is
simply
that,
an
inquiry.
there's
a
basis
to
ask
the
prosecutor
the
reason.
that's
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
that's
quite
different
than
sending
a
case
to
the
jury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
the...
your...
there's
some
difficulty
in...
in
trying
to
equate
batson
challenges
and...
and
title
vii,
and
that's
because
your
beginning
point
is
that
you
base...
you...
you
require
too
much
of
the
prima
facie
case.
it...
it
seems
to
me
all
that's
required
under
batson
is
reason
to
inquire.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's...
that's
a
special
use
of
the
term
prima
facie.
now,
if...
if
we
want
to
be
consistent
with
the
use
of
the
word...
of
the
term,
prima
facie,
from
batson
to
title
vii,
then
it
seems
to
me
this
inquiry
is
necessary.
but...
and
you're
the
one
that
puts
it
in
motion
by
setting
this
rather
high
threshold
that
is
the
same
as
to
go
to
a
jury.
i
disagree
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
is
that
like
permitting
discovery
to
go
forward?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
is
that
standard
less
than
going
to
a
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
that...
that's...
i
recognize
that
it's
been
difficult
for
us
to
find
an
analog.
it
may
be
that
batson
is
sui
generis.
it
may
not
be.
if
we're
going
to
talk
about
what
judges
are
familiar
with,
then
it's
prima
facie
case
and
it's
title
vii.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
take
it
in
your
view
the
california
standard
is
more
strict
than
the
title
vii
standard
for
prima
facie
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
we
say
that
that
equates
to
a
standard
of
more
likely
than
not
or
do
we
not
say
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
step
one
of
title
vii
more
likely
than
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
see
how
that's
much
different
from
what
california
is
doing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do...
do
you
agree
that
the
california
standard
is
more
rigorous
than
the
standard
applied
by
the
federal
courts
and
by
most
state
courts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
the
california
rule
is
the
same
as
the
federal
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
hanson,
and
is
it
purkett
v.
elem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why...
why
is
the
defense
attorney
in
a
better
position
to
explain
the...
the
motives
of
the
prosecutor
than
the
prosecutor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
question
is
what
motivated
the
prosecutor.
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
the...
the
defense
counsel
is
in
a
better
position
than
the
prosecutor
to
show
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
of
course,
you
can
afford
to
be
very
rigorous
at
step
two
because
your
threshold
at
step
one
is
high.
the
threshold
is...
if
the
threshold
at
step
one
is...
is
easier
to
cross,
then
we
could
be
more
rigorous
at...
at
step
two.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
your
test
is...
is
that
the
judge
under
california
law
is
required
to
find
that
there's
a
strong
likelihood
or
a
reasonable
likelihood,
but
he
must
do
that
without
hearing
the
prosecutor's
reasons.
that's
your
position.
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
i...
i
just
confirm
my
understanding
of
how
the
jury
selection
process
in
california
works?
all
the
for-cause
challenges
are...
are
made
and
ruled
upon.
then
there
are
12
jurors
in
the
box,
and
then
you
make
the
peremptory
challenge
juror
by
juror.
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
after
the
for-cause
challenges
have
been--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--then
you
exhaust
it.
