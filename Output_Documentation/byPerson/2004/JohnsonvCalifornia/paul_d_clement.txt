mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
court
with
an
opportunity
to
reaffirm
that
all
government
policies
based
on
race
are
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
the
deference
generally
owed
to
the
sound
judgment
of
prison
officials
does
not
require
this
court
to
modify
its
repeated
statements
that
all
government
action
based
on
race
should
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
including
when
they
have...
when
justices
have
made
reference
to
prison
policies,
that
all
government
actions
based
on
race
are
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
first
amendment
obviously
has
been
subjected,
at
least
when
you're
talking
about
things
other
than
outgoing
prisoner
mail,
to
be
subjected
to
the
turner
analysis,
but
no...
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
the
turner
analysis
applies
to
race.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely,
justice
stevens.
i
think
if
the
turner
analysis
is
correctly
applied
in
this
case,
this
policy
does
not
even
survive
turner
analysis.
i
would
suggest
it's
very
analogous
to
the
marriage
policy
that
the
court
struck
down
in
turner
applying
the
turner
analysis
because
there
the
state
identified
a
concern
with
inmate
marriages
and
particularly
with
inmate-to-inmate
marriages,
and
yet
they
adopted
a
policy
that
prohibited
all
inmate
marriages.
here
there's
a
concern
that's
expressed
with
newly
arriving
inmates,
about
whom
california
says
it
knows
very
little.
yet,
it
applies
its
policies
to
transferring
inmates,
as
well
as
to
returning
parolees.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
either
one
of
those
would
be
a
constitutional--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--holding
of
this
court,
and
i
think
either
under
turner
or
under
strict
scrutiny,
it's
still
equally
a
constitutional
holding.
and
i
think
it
would
send
an
improper
message
to
suggest
that
there's
some
element
of
government
decision-making
that
is
somehow
exempt
from
strict
scrutiny.
i
think
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
this
court,
where
it
generally
reviews
a
government
action
deferentially...
take,
for
example,
jury
selection,
peremptory
challenges.
take,
for
example,
military
policy.
take,
for
example,
congressional
districting.
those
are
all
government
policies
this
court
generally
refuse...
reviews
under
a
highly
deferential
standard.
yet,
nonetheless,
when
it
comes
to
government
policies
based
on
race,
this
court
applies
strict
scrutiny.
and
in
that
sense,
i
think
the
racial
districting
cases
provide
a
very
good
example
because
there,
generally,
as
the
vieth
case
from
last
term
illustrates,
this
court
is
very
reluctant
to
do
any
review
of
the
districting
lines
that
are
drawn.
yet,
when
race
is
identified
as
being
the
cause
for
the
lines
being
drawn,
as
in
miller
against
johnson,
this
court
emphasizes
that
strict
scrutiny
applies.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
that's
part
of
it,
justice
souter.
i
think
one
thing
is
that
particularly
because
of
the
history
of
this
country
and
the
use
of...
of
race
by
governments,
including
in
prisons,
there
is
a
concern
that
all
government
uses
of
race
must
be
subjected
to
very
heightened
scrutiny.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
again,
i
think,
though,
that
there
is
almost
a
uniquely
pernicious
history
involving
race
in
this
country,
and
i
think,
again,
it
is
completely
wrong
to
suggest
that
somehow
prisons
were
exempt
from
that
history.
to
the
contrary.
throughout
the
nation
before
brown
against
board
of
education,
it
was
common
for
prisons
to
be
segregated
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
lasts
60
days,
is
the
best
evidence.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
in
lee
against
washington,
this
court
upheld
the
integration
not
just
of
the
alabama
prisons,
but
the
alabama
jails,
and
the
evidence
before
the
court
there...
and
this
is
clear
from
the
three-judge
opinion...
is
that
the
average
stay
in
the
birmingham
city
jail
was
7
to
15
days.
nonetheless,
this
court
said
that
7
to
15
days
of
racial
segregation
was
too
much.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
that's
true,
justice
souter.
i
mean,
i
think
if
you
look
at
brown
against
board
of
education
itself
and
you
look
at
the
various
per
curiam
opinions
that
this
court
issued
in
the
wake
of
brown
v.
board,
i
don't
think
any
of
those
decisions
have
a
hallmark
of
being
elaborate
about
the
standard
of
review
that
the
court
has
applied.
nonetheless--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
disagree.
the
entire
time
these
prisoners
are
kept
at
the
reception
center,
which
is
a
separate
part
of
the
facility
where
the
incoming
inmates
go,
that
entire
time
they
are
segregated
on
the
basis
of
race.
now,
the
bureau
of
prisons,
for
example,
has
a
similar
entry
section
in
its
various
prisons.
it's
called
the
admissions
and
orientations
process,
and
there,
using
the
presentence
reports
that
are
provided
for
by
california
law,
the
federal
officials
evaluate
prisoners
and
their
risk
levels
and
have
no
need
to
segregate
those
prisoners
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
your
honors,
that
misdescribes
the...
the
population
of
the
federal
prisons.
part
of
where
i
think
they
get
off
on
the
wrong
step
is
they
do
their
analysis
only
on
the
offense
of
conviction.
but
a
lot
of
the
individuals
in
the
federal
prisons
are,
say,
for
example,
convicted
felons
who
are
convicted
for
felony
in
possession.
and
the
underlying
felony
that
led
them
to
be,
say,
a
924(c)
defendant
was
a
violent
felony.
and
so
we...
there
are
also
agreements
by
which
the
bureau
of
prisoners,
on
request
from
states,
will
house
the
state's
most
violent
criminals.
so
i
think
that's
an
unfair
description
of
what
the
bureau
of
prisons
policy...
or
population
looks
like.
and
i
think
the
fact
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
virtually
every
other
state
that's
looked
at
this
issue
has
found
a
mechanism
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
incoming
inmates
without
resorting
to
race
is
a
powerful
indication
that
this
kind
of
use
of
race
is
unnecessary.
and
the
problem
with
applying
turner,
rather
than
strict
scrutiny,
i
think
is
well
illustrated
by
this
case
and
this
policy.
this
is
a
policy
that
is
expressly
acknowledged
to
take
race
into
account,
and
it
is
nowhere
written
down.
if
you
pull
the
department
of
correction
manual
for
the
california
prison
system,
there's
a
94-page
chapter
on
the
classification
of
inmates.
yet,
this
policy
doesn't
appear
there.
it's
an
unwritten
policy.
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked,
well,
was
this
policy
introduced
in
response
to
specific
incidents
of
violence
in
a
cell.
the
answer
to
that
is
unknowable
because
nobody
even
knows
how
long
this
policy
has
been
in
place.
the
official
responsible
for
administering
it
acknowledged
it's
been
in
place
for
25
years.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
what
i'm
suggesting,
justice
o'connor,
is
what
the...
the
application
of
turner
to
this
policy
allowed.
it's
to
allow
an
unwritten
policy
where...
of
uncertain
origins--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
it
wouldn't
survive
a
proper
analysis
under
turner.
that
is
correct.
but
the...
the
court
of
appeals
here,
applying
its
version
of
turner,
upheld
this
policy.
and
i
think
one
way
of
looking
at
the
choice
between
turner
and
strict
scrutiny
is
whether
there
is
a
greater
threat
that
frequent
judicial
approvals
of
prisons'
use
of
race
will
have
the
effect
of
diluting
the
strict
scrutiny
rigor
or
whether
frequent
disapprovals
of
prisons'
use
of
race
will
have
the
effect
of
undermining
the
turner
deference.
and
the
concern
of
the
federal
government
is
exactly
that,
that
by
having
race
policies
evaluated
under
turner,
there
will
be
a
necessary
temptation
to
bump
up
the
turner
analysis
in
a
way
that
strikes
down
racial
policies.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think...
i
think
california...
it's...
it's
best
described
as
california
is
one
of
at
most
a
couple
of
states
that
have
a
comparable
cell-based
policy
of
segregation.
and
so
i
think
it
really
is
kind
of
the
outlier
in
terms
of
that
analysis.
now,
there
may
be
situations...
and
we
think
strict
scrutiny
can
account
for
them...
where
states
want
to
take
race
into
account
in
particularized
circumstances.
and
i
think
testing
those
under
strict
scrutiny
is
the
proper
mode
of
analysis.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
your
honor.
