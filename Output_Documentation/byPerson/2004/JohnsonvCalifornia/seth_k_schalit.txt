mr.
seth
k.
schalit
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
position
would
require
this
court
to
abandon
batson's
requirement
for
a
shifting
burden
of
production
or
to
announce
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
evidence
that
burdens
of
production
shift
based
on
improbable
inferences.
the
standard
recognized
by
the
state
is
consistent
with
batson.
batson
provided
for
a
shifting
burden
of
production
and
it
directed
the
courts
to
look
to
this
court's
title
vii
cases
to
see
how
that
process
operates.
in
title
vii--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--no,
your
honor.
california's
standard
is
consistent
with
batson.
now,
there
are
very,
very
few
courts
that
have
actually
considered
the
precise
question
presented
here.
california
does
not
stand
alone
its
analysis
of
this--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--i
think
the
federal
rule
has
been
stated
in
many
different
ways.
the
federal
rule
has
been
stated
by
lower
courts
in
many
different
ways.
it
is
certainly
the
same
as
or
consistent
with
the
federal
rule
as
announced
by
batson,
which
is
the
only
question
that
matters
because
in
batson--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--yes,
your
honor.
in...
in
purkett
and
in...
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
hernandez...
i
may
have
misheard
you...
the
court
reiterated
the
three-step
process.
all
of
those
cases,
however,
rely
on
the
existence
of
a
step
one
with
a
shifting
burden
of
production
before
reasons
must
be
given
and
they
must
be
given
when
step
one
is
met.
the
objecting
party
must
make
a
prima
facie
case.
that
does
not
happen
until
he
has
shown
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
there
is
discrimination.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
your
honor,
in
the
title
vii
circumstance,
you
are
correct.
the
ultimate,
ultimate
finding
is,
of
course,
made
after
the
employer
responds
if
the
employer
chooses
to
respond
in
light
of
all
of
the
evidence.
the
employer
may
not
respond,
for
example,
if
the
employer
does
not
believe
those
four
elements
have
been
established
or
the
jury
would
find
them
to
be
established.
however,
if
those
four
elements
are
established
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
according
to
this
court
in
st.
mary's
honor
center
and
in...
in
burdine
or
burdine,
the
obligation
is
on
the
fact
finder
at
that
point
to
find
for
the
employee
if
there's
no
response
at
step
two
because
a
presumption
is
established.
and
furnco
expressly
states
that
there
is
a
presumption
because
the
prima
facie
case
if
established
makes
it
more
likely
than
not
that
there
was
discrimination.
the
prima
facie
case
in
the
run
of
the...
run
of
the
cases
we
know
the
reason
that
those
four
facts
are
true
is
that
there
was
discrimination
in
the
face
of
silence.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes,
your
honor.
it...
it
shifts
the
burden
of
production,
but
the
reason
it
does
so
is
that,
in
the
language
of
wigmore,
the
employee,
or
in
a
title
vii
case,
the
objecting
party,
has
gone
further.
the...
that
party
has
not
simply
removed
the
obligation
to
present
evidence
from
which
one
can
infer
a
fact.
but
he
has
gone
further
and
presented
sufficient
evidence
to
entitle
that
party
to
prevail
in
the
face
of
his
opponent's
silence.
and
justice
powell,
writing
the
opinion
in
batson,
clearly
referred
to
the
court's
title
vii
cases,
including
the
opinion
that
he
wrote
for
the
court
in
burdine,
which
in
the
footnote
expressly
stated
that
the
mcdonnell
douglas
presumption
does
not
adopt
the
prima
facie
case
in
the
sense
of
merely
allowing
the
jury
to
make
a
finding.
it
stated
that...
adopted
the
prima
facie
case
with
a
shifting
burden
of
production,
and
that
is
one
with
a
presumption
that
entitles
the
party
to
prevail.
the
same
is
true--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--it
is
enough
to
say
that
when
unexplained,
when
there's
no
response
from
the
employer,
yes.
the
jury
is
instructed
that--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--that--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--well,
that
is...
your
honor,
sorry.
that
was
my
reading
of...
of
st.
mary's
when...
and
burdine
when
a--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--well,
your
honor,
in
the
title
vii
case,
i
believe
that
what
happens
is
that
the
case
does
go
to
the
jury.
it
is
not
a
directed
verdict.
it
is--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--no,
your
honor.
to
be...
let
me...
let
me
be
perhaps
slightly
more
precise.
it
is
not
a
directed
verdict.
it
is
a
requirement
for
the
court
to
instruct
the
jury
to
make
a
finding
if...
if
in
fact
it
finds
all
the
four
elements
to
be
true.
that
is
still
a
jury
question.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
right.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
because
that
would
upset
the
balance
that...
that
batson
has
drawn.
suspicious
circumstance
was
the
same
type
of
problem
confronted
in
rosales-lopez
and
ristaino.
the
court
adopted
a
possibility
of
a
racial
bias
test
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
of
jurors
on
voir
dire
as
to
whether
there's
discrimination
for
use
in
a
federal
system
as
a
rule
of
criminal
process
and
supervision
over
the
federal
courts.
it
refused
to
apply
that
test,
which
is
akin
to
the
test
adopted
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
advocated
by
petitioner,
in
ristaino
because
it
recognized
that
we
should
not
adopt
a
divisive
assumption
that
everything
turns
on
race.
it
would
be
a
very
simple
matter
to
inquire
of
jurors
on
voir
dire
about
their
racial
biases
on
a
mere
possibility.
the
same
argument
about
let
us
simply
inquire
and
find
out
could
be
applied.
after
all,
these--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--no,
your
honor.
i
would
agree
that
that
is
simply
not
enough.
and
batson
demonstrates
that
that
is
not
enough
because
in
batson
there
were
four
blacks
challenged,
all
four
blacks
in
a
case
involving
a
black
defendant.
you
must
show
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
at
batson...
as
batson
says,
that
there's
discrimination,
and
that
includes
circumstances
that
may
refute
the
case
because,
as
batson
says,
the
statements
of
the
prosecutor
and
questions--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--yes,
and
this
is
step
one,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
this
is
all
step
one.
batson,
at
page
97,
states
that
a
prosecutor's
questions
and
statements
on
voir
dire
in
exercising
the
challenges
may
support
or
refute
an...
an
inference
of
discrimination.
the
party
who
is
making
the
claim
is
in
the
best
position,
any
party
who
wants
to
be
in,
in
terms
of
making
a
claim
to
a
fact
finder.
he
has
the
fact
finder
before
him.
that
fact
finder
has
witnessed
the
same
thing
as
the
party.
they
are
all
professionals
and
skilled
in
this
area.
and
if
that
single
juror
was
struck
because
of
race,
the
party
can
say
that
it
was
the
same
race
as
the
defendant
if
that
may
be
a
fact.
it
may
be
that
that...
there's
no
apparent
explanation
because,
let's
say,
it
was
a...
another
prosecutor
who
has
struck--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--not--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--not
to
explain
the
motives,
your
honor,
but
to
confront
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
are
present
in
that
courtroom
that
batson
requires
that
party
to
confront.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
he's
in
a
better...
he
is
in
the
position
to
meet
his
obligation
under
batson
to
explain
why,
given--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--yes,
your
honor,
and
thank
you.
that
is
a
more--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--step
two
does
not
have
any
persuasiveness
component
to
it.
there
is
no
rigorousness
to
it
in
my
mind.
it
is
merely
a
statement
of
a
race-neutral
reason
or
reasons.
it
is
not
the
time
to
persuade,
and
we
know
that
from
purkett.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
here,
because
there
was
no
prima
facie
case,
your
honor,
yes,
there
was
no
reason
given.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
there
may
be
an
adverse
inference
that
would
be
drawn
from
that.
there
might
be
issue
preclusion.
there
might
be
a
termination
sanction.
there's
a
range,
as
i
understand
civil
procedure,
of...
of
options
that
are
available.
in
this
context,
of
course,
petitioner
asserts
that
there
could
be
an
adverse
inference
drawn
from
silence.
however,
if
the
standard
is,
as
he
proposes,
that
there
is
simply
a
mere
inference
from
which
discrimination
can
be
detected,
the
silence
of
the
striking
party
may
have
no
informative
content.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes,
your
honor.
there...
there
could
be
issue
preclusion.
i
assume
that's--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--yes,
but
in...
in
this
circumstance,
the...
the
striking
party's
silence
is
one...
when
the
test
is
set
at
the
inference
level
not
at
the
more
likely
than
not
level,
the...
the
test
is
one...
i'm
sorry...
not
the
test,
but
the...
the
silence
is
one
of
strategic
judgment.
let
me
balance
the
risk
of
having
the
adverse
inference
drawn
against
me
against
the
risk
of
disclosing
my
trial
strategy
or
my
voir
dire
strategy.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
he
doesn't
always
answer
the
question
because
it
is
understood
that,
having
shown
at
step
one
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
there's
discrimination,
silence
at
step
two
will
result
in
an
adverse
finding.
and--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
in
a
case
of...
of--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--no.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes,
your
honor,
because
in
that
circumstance
in
deciding--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--in
california,
we
like
every
other
jurisdiction,
as
far
as
i
know,
probably
has
two
definitions,
just
as
this
court
does.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes.
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
no,
your
honor,
because
in
that
circumstance--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes,
your
honor.
a
fact
finder
could
make
a...
a
conclusion
from
that,
but
the--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--because,
for
example,
the
appellate
perspective
as
to
whether
a
fact
finder
could
make
that
conclusion,
could
any
rational
finder
of
facts
draw
that
conclusion.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
it
is
not
a
question
of...
of
imagining
reasons,
your
honor.
it
is
a
question
of
the
judge
bringing
his
or
her
observation
to
what
has
occurred
in
the
courtroom,
and
to
return
to
the
example--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--yes,
it
might
in
that
the...
the
inference
would
be
probably...
it
would
be
much
stronger
the
greater
number
you
have.
but,
for
example,
those
12
could
theoretically
all
still
be
defense
attorneys.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes,
your
honor.
step
one,
because
you
do
not
hear
reasons
until,
under
jeb,
you've
gone
past
step
one
and
get
the
reasons
at
step
two.
under
batson,
you
do,
however,
consider
information
that
may
refute
the
inference.
batson
tells
the
judge
to
do
that
and
to
consider
the
totality
of
the
circumstance.
and
justice
stevens's
observation
about
the
difference
between
the
two
tests
is
true,
but
in
the...
in
the
circumstance
in
which
the
question
is
whether
it
goes
to
the
jury
to
avoid,
for
example,
non-suit,
that
is
because
there
is
a
fact
finder
for
the
case
to
go
to
separate
from
the
judge,
and
that
fact
finder
does
not
have
to
make
an
intermediate
determination.
here
the
court
has--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--but
it
does
also
turn,
your
honor,
in
part
on
the
nature
of
the
interest
at
issue,
and
the
particular
process
that
the
court
set
up
in
batson
to
create
an
order...
order...
system
of
proof
and
to
allow
the
proper
balance
to
be
struck
between
the
importance
of
peremptory
challenges
and
their
use
in
selecting
a
fair
and
unbiased
jury
and
the
interest
in
assuring
that
there
has
not
been
a
constitutional
violation,
much
for
the
same
reason
that
in
ristaino
we
do
not
inquire
on
mere
possibility.
there
are
countervailing
interests.
in
ristaino
there
has
to
be
much
more
than
a
mere
possibility.
in
batson,
the
court
sought
to
move
away
from
the
difficult-to-establish
standard
of
swain
to
something
that
would
be
more
flexible
yet
still
maintain
the
state's
interest
in
having
a
peremptory
challenge
system.
your
honors,
california
does
not
stand
alone
in
its
interpretation
of
this
test.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
there
are
very
few
states
that
have
considered
this
issue.
connecticut,
maryland
have
done
what
this
court
said
it...
they
should
do,
what
all
courts
should
do
and
look
at
the
title
vii
cases.
california
has
done
that.
it
has
not
announced
a
standard
that
is
inconsistent
with
batson.
it
has
announced
a
standard
that
follows
from
this
court's
direction
in
batson.
it
has
required
a
shifting
burden
of
production
which
does
not
occur
until
there
has
been
either
a
presumption
or
a
strong
mass
of
evidence,
to
use
wigmore's
term.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
i
think
it
provides
a
close
analogy.
it
is
not...
it
is
not
a
perfect
fit,
no,
your
honor.
but
it
does...
but
the
court
very
carefully
directed
parties
and
courts
to
look
to
title
vii
for
understanding
of
the
operation
of
the
proof
rules.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
phrasing
was
that
it's
explained
the
operation
of
prima
facie
burden
of
proof
rules,
and
that's
the
footnote
on
page
94,
sort
of
the
operation
of
the
burden
of
proof
rules
that
is
at
issue
here.
and
the
burden
of
proof
and
burden
of
production
rules--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--well,
your
honor,
california's
supreme
court
did.
connecticut
did.
[laughter]
and
given
the...
given
the...
an
occasion
to
do
so,
i
think
that's
the
appropriate
path
to
take.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes,
your
honor.
there
may
be
more
jurors
that
have
been
subject
to
voir
dire
if
a
six
pack
is
used,
but
challenges
are
only
made
to
those
in
the
box
when
the
box
is
full,
there's
a
complement
of
jurors.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes,
your
honor.
and,
of
course,
in
california
like
elsewhere,
peremptories
are
used
sometimes
to
remedy
a
failure
to
properly
grant
a
challenge
for
cause.
your
honors,
california's
system
maintains
a
proper
balance
between
protection
interests
and
the
state's
and
parties'
interests
in
using
a
venerable
tool
for
selecting
a
fair
and
unbiased
juror.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
oh,
please.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
california
is
following
the
standard
that
we
believe
batson
has
identified.
now,
there
are
certainly
federal
courts,
such
as
the
ninth
circuit,
that
disagree
with
that.
and
so
all
federal
courts
do
not
do
what
california
believes
batson
allows
to
be
done.
the
ninth
circuit
has
concluded
that
california's
standard
is
contrary
to
and
an
unreasonable
application
of
batson.
that's
wade
v.
terhune,
202
f.
3rd.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
we're
arguing,
first,
the
ninth
circuit
is
wrong
and
that
california's
rule
is
consistent
with
batson.
now,
as
to
whether
other
rules
may
apply,
batson
has
a
footnote
stating
that
it
was
not
going
to
attempt
to
instruct
courts
on
how
to
apply
its
process.
that
might
leave
room
for
other
states
to
come
up
with
alternate
systems
of
proof.
what
is
important
here
is
that
california's
system
is
consistent,
and
as
the
respondent,
we
are
not
seeking
to
require
all
states
to
do
something.
rather,
as
the
respondent,
it
is
sufficient
that
california's
process
is
acceptable
just
as
california's
process
was
acceptable
in
smith
v.
robbins
for
handling
cases
in
which
there
are
no
nonfrivolous
appeals
on
issues.
a
variety
of
standards
perhaps
could
be
tolerated.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
because
it
intrudes
on
other
interests
that
our
state--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--it
intrudes
on--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--i
believe
it
intrudes
on
the
parties'
interest
and
work
product
and
opinion
work
product
and
attorney-client
privilege
and
perhaps
even
the
defendant's
sixth...
sixth
amendment
right
because
it
may
require
divulgence
of
those
types
of
confidences.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
absolutely,
your
honor,
yes.
using
peremptory
challenges
to
select
a
fair
and
unbiased
jury
is
very
important
to
the
state.
having
confidence
that
the
juries
are
fair
and
unbiased
is
important
because
it
allows
parties
to
accept
the
results
of
verdicts
as
being
a
product
of
a
fair
and
just
system.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
because--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--because
the...
the
challenges
essentially
cease
being
peremptory
and
become
quasi-challenges
for
cause.
the
state
has
an
interest
in
maintaining
the
system
as
a
peremptory
challenge
system
and
in
maintaining
sixth
amendment
privileges
and
work
product.
and
it
has--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--well,
the
challenge
does
cease
being
peremptory
because
the
equal
protection
clause
has
overturned
the
state
statute
that
provides
that
challenges...
peremptory
challenges
are
challenges
for
which
no
reason
need
be
given.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
absolutely
not.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
because
batson
could
have
chosen
to
adopt
a
connecticut-style
strict
objection
system.
it
did
not
do
that.
the
court
has
made
a
judgment
about
the
nature
of
peremptories
as
peremptories
as
still
being
important.
preserving
that
interest
in
using
those
and
not
disclosing
trial
strategy
is
important.
having...
avoiding
the
risk
that
a
party
may
respond
with
unarticulable
reasons
that
erroneously
won't
be
believed
is
important.
we
do
not
want
to
chill
the
exercise
of
challenges
for
those
reasons
that
are
not
based
on
discriminatory
reasons
but
are
unarticulable.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
well,
certainly
there...
there
is
a
somewhat
different
consequence
in...
in
the
standard
as
articulated
by
petitioner
in
that
the
striking
party
does
get
perhaps
a
freebie.
and
california
doesn't
accept
that.
we've
recognized
that
in
state
supreme
court
cases
there
are
no
substantial
free
challenges.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
oh.
[laughter]
hopefully
not--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--thank
you,
your
honors.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions.
