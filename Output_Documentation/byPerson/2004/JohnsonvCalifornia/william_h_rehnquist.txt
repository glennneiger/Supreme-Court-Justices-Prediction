04-6964,
jay
shawn
johnson
v.
california.
mr.
bedrick.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
very
low
standard
in
the
first
place,
and
why
should
it
be
watered
down
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
practice,
mr.
bedrick,
is
it
always
worked
out
like
this
kind
of
a
minuet?
first
we
have
step
one
and
step
two.
isn't
a
lot
of
it
just
at
a
bench
conference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bedrick.
mr.
schalit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
step
one,
i
take
it
it's
not
enough
to
simply
say,
look,
the
person
challenged
is
a
member
of
a
minority
group.
what
more
must
be
shown?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i'm
talking
about
step
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
all
step
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
state
has
an
interest
in
exercising
peremptories.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schalit.
mr.
bedrick,
you
have
4
minutes
left.

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schalit.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice

h.
