mr.
bert
h.
deixler
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
whether
the
california
department
of
corrections,
unlike
every
other
state
in
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons,
may
continue
its
more
than
28-year,
unexamined
practice
of
routine,
blanket
racial
segregation
of
its
prisoners.
the
unitary
practice
in
question
here
was
applied
more
than
350,000
times
last
year,
not
just
to
the
40,000
new
prisoners
entering
the
california
system,
but
to
all
72,000
returning
parolees
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
transfer
prisoners
such
as
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
garrison
johnson,
a
petitioner
who
had
been
housed
for
more
than
15
years
in
the
california
prison
system.
this
unexamined,
routine
practice
effectively
erected
whites
only,
blacks
only,
hispanics
only
signs
over
the
portals
of
the
california
prison
system,
and
it
is
a
practice
which
is
routed
in
racial
stereotype
and
the
belief
that
all
persons
of
a
race
think
alike
and
act
alike.
california's
needless
and
dangerous
policy
fails
both
the
strict
scrutiny
test,
which
the
ninth
circuit
should
have
applied,
and
the
turner
deference
standard,
which
the
ninth
circuit
wrongly
applied.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
yes,
justice
o'connor,
it
is.
the--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--yes,
correct,
your
honor.
in...
in
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
petitioner
johnson,
for
example,
during
his
15
years,
had
been
transferred
on
five
separate
occasions,
and
the
circumstances
which
he
experienced
are
not
unusual
within
the
california
prison
system.
indeed,
an
outside-the-record
fact:
within
the
last
3
weeks,
he's
been
informed
that
he's
to
be
transferred
yet
again
within
the
california
prison
system
to
another
facility
called
corcoran.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
the
circumstances
in
other
states,
which
we've
been
able
to
identify,
include
a
range
of...
of
circumstances,
which
include...
as
is
available
in
california
under
the
penal
code
section,
which
requires
the
delivery
of
a
presentence
report,
together
with
a
commitment
order,
is
analysis
on
a
particularized
circumstance
basis
of
the
individuals
who
are
coming
into
the
prison
and
making
a...
an
estimate
as
to
what
may
occur.
other
states
use
a
random
assignment
circumstance,
and
giving
no
consideration
whatever
to
race.
and
a
third
group
of
states
apparently
consider
race
as
part
of
an
overall
or
holistic
bit
of
analysis
with
regard
to
trying
to
equalize
the
prison
populations.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
well,
the
best
empirical
evidence
which
exists
that
we're
familiar
with
was
reported
in
the
trulson
study,
which
the
dissenters
in
the
ninth
circuit
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
relied
upon
and
which
the
amici
have
filed
with
this
court.
and
in
that
circumstance,
it
suggests,
over
a
10-year
study
in
texas,
that
only
5
percent
of
all
of
the
interracial...
of...
of
all
of
the
incidents
of
violence
in...
in
the
texas
prison
system
were
what
was
described
by
professor
trulson
as
having
racial
motivations.
and
of
that
5
percent,
only
one-quarter,
or
about
1.2
percent,
were
interracial
circumstances
where
there
had
been
interracial
cellmates
involved
in
the
racial
violence.
and
that
seems
to
be,
as
far
as
anyone
has
been
able
to
produce
in
this
case
in
any
part
of
the
record,
the
best
empirical
data
which
might
respond
to
your
question,
justice
scalia.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
justice
ginsburg,
one
of
the
interesting
things
about
the
record
in
this
case
is
that
the
state
of
california
has
been
unable
to
identify
a
single
incident
of
a...
of
interracial
violence
between
cellmates.
the
record
is
bereft
of
that
kind
of
information.
rather,
they've
spoken
of
information
about
violence
which
occurs
in
more--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--i
think
the...
i
think
the
record
suggests,
as
at
least
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
johnson,
that
it
is
a
de
facto
segregation
system
which
exists
after
the
60-day
period
and
outside
the
transfer
60-day
period,
and
so
it
would
be
hard
for
the
state
of
california
to
provide...
to
provide
that
data.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
well,
justice
kennedy,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
court's
strict
scrutiny
analysis,
which
in
my
judgment
should
have
applied
here,
and
under
the
particularized
circumstance
test
announced
in
the
lee
case
in
the
concurrence,
that
a
circumstance
involving
a
single
prisoner
in
a
single
prison
cell
on
one
occasion
ought
not
to
give
rise
to
a
systematic
change
in...
in
a
policy
which
is
rooted
in
racial
stereotype.
with
regard
to
those
prisoners
involved
in
that
particular
circumstance,
of
course,
some
period
of...
of
segregation
would
be
appropriate
as
a
means
of
controlling
and
ensuring
that
there's
not
going
to
be
some
kind
of
wholesale
racial
violence.
that--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--well,
justice
scalia,
the
fundamental
teachings
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
this
court
demonstrate
that
race
is
different,
that
the
government
use
of
race
is
presumed
to
be
unlawful--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--yes.
the
turner
standard
certainly
reflects
a
consideration
by
this
court
that
deference
is
appropriate
with
regard
to
rights
which
are
inconsistent
with
incarceration.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
even
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
yes.
the
first
amendment
rights
are
very
important.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
however,
in
the
context
of
incarceration,
a
sacrifice
of
the
right
to
assembly,
the
right
to
correspond
in
certain
circumstances,
to
contact
visits
are
things
which
are
well
within
the
ambit
of
what
a
prison
needs
to
control.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
and
in...
and
in
the
circumstances
that
the
court's
test
has
been
announced
in
turner,
that's
certainly
within
the
ambit
of
a
right
which
the
prison
authorities
might
properly
exercise.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
well,
because
this
court
decided--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--there's
no
doubt...
justice
scalia,
there's
no
doubt
that
there
are
racial
gangs
in
prison,
but
this
policy
of
california
is
directed
not
to
the
gang
aspect
of
it
but
to
the
race
aspect.
the
record
is
clear
that
there's
a
near
0
percent
chance
that
any
black
person
could
be
housed
with
any
white
person,
that
any
white
person
could
be
housed
with
any
hispanic
person,
without
reference
to
the
gang
question.
and
this
is
a
transfer
policy
which
recurs
and
recurs,
five
times
in
the
case
of...
of--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
even
under
turner--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--we
would...
we
would
be
pleased
to...
to
prevail
under...
under
turner,
justice
stevens.
it
seems
that
consistent
with
the
court's
teachings
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
most
recent
considerations
by
the
court
of
equal
protection
and
strict
scrutiny,
that
the
use
of
race
by
california
in
this
context
should
trigger
a
strict
scrutiny
analysis,
should
lead
to
an
analysis
of
whether
there
has
been
narrow
tailoring.
but
under
the
turner
test,
we
believe
properly
applied,
the
petitioner
should
prevail
as
well.
under
the
turner
test,
it
seems
that
at
least
two
of
the
four
elements
which
are
announced
in
turner
couldn't
possibly
be
met
here.
the
first
one
is
it
seems
to
be
no...
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
government
regulation
which
is
at
issue
and
the
announced
policy.
the
notion
that
one
can
determine
by
race
alone
a
violent
propensity
seems
irrational,
unreasonable,
and
contrary
to
the
only
empirical
evidence
which
exists,
the
trulson
study.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
no,
i
don't
think
such
a
statistic--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--well,
in
fact,
in
part
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
the...
the--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--without
more,
justice
kennedy,
that
inference
cannot
be
drawn,
and
i'll
give
the
court
the
example
of
the
crips
and
the
bloods--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--that
they
are
not
to
the
extent
that,
justice
kennedy,
you're
asking
whether
it
is
an
interracial
threat.
it
is...
it
is
undoubtedly
true,
taking
the
example
of
the
crips
and
the
bloods,
that
they
are
intraracial
threats,
and
indeed
prison
policy
directed
towards
separating
crips
and
bloods
because
of
the...
of
the
intraracial
problem
is
certainly
one
which
would
be
something
that
the...
the
prison
system
should
address.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
the...
there's
no
evidence
which
has
been
produced
in
this
record
which
would
suggest
that
the
policy
can
be
tied
from
skin
color
to
gang
membership
and
from
gang
membership
to
interracial
violence.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
not
in
the
record
of
this
case,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
yes.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
i
think
on
race
alone,
the
prison
system
would
run
afoul
of
the
constitution
in
making
that
determination.
if
it...
if
race
were
analyzed
in
the
context
of
gang
membership,
as
part
of
an
overall
analysis
of
proclivity
to
violence
based
upon
a
series
of
facts
existing
in
that
prison,
particularized
circumstances,
as
suggested
in
the
lee
case,
i
think
that
would
be
a
proper
analysis
and
constitutional.
it's--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
yes.
in
that
particular
case,
gang
membership
is
not
a
surrogate
for
race.
in
the
california
policy,
race
is
a
surrogate
for
gang
membership.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--yes.
well,
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
mckune
case
under
a
fifth
amendment
analysis,
it
was
found
that
that
didn't...
it
was
not
analyzed
under
a
turner
standard.
and
even
in
the
harper
case,
before
the
determination
of
the
liberty
right
being
taken
under
the
turner
standard,
the
court
relied
upon
procedural
due
process
rights
which
were
exercised
in...
in
the
state
of
washington
with
regard
to...
to
the
prisoner.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
the...
the
hypotheticals
presented
by
the
state
of
california,
when
applied
in
the
context
of
this
case,
demonstrate
the
danger
of
this
position
of
segregation.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
not
a
gang
member.
he's
been
in
the
california
prison
system
since
1987
and
before.
when
he
reported
to
the
inmate
reception
center
at
chino
in
1987,
he
had
already
three
presentence
reports
which
are
reflected
in...
in
the
record
of
this...
of
this
case
at
the
joint
exhibit
259.
he's
been
transferred
five
times
since
then...
since
then.
there's
no
record
of
his
having
had
interracial
violence
ever
during
the
time
that
he
was
in
prison.
and
it
is
his
view,
as
articulated
in
his
deposition
at
page
109
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
he
is
put
into
peril
because
he
is
an
african
american
who
is
unable
to
cross
race
lines
and
unable
to
reach
out
for
support
in
a
heavily
racialized
setting
for
other
persons
who
are
not
african
americans
and
who
are
not
gang
members.
so
he's
been
marginalized
and
treated,
based
upon
his
race,
in
a
de
jure
way
when
he's
transferred
for
the
60-day
period.
and
incidentally,
the
reference
to
a
14-day
period
is
not
borne
out
by
the
record.
the
regulation
in
the
state
of
california
specifically
provides
that
this
organization
or
evaluation
group
has
to
convene
within
14
days,
but
not
have
to
reach
a
decision
with
regard
to
transfer
characterization
and
classification
in
14
days.
but...
but
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
because
he's
black
and
has
no
opportunity
to
cell
initially
with
a
white
person
or
a
hispanic
person,
is
then
confined
to
being
in
this
small
group
of
african
americans
who
are
not
gang
members
and
who
are
unable
to
have
an
affinity
group
in
which
they
will
feel
safe
within
the
california
prison
system.
the
california--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--yes.
a
white--
mr.
bert
h.
deixler
--a
white
who,
for
reasons
of
safety,
wished
to
house
with
an
african
american,
would
be
denied
that
opportunity
under
california's
policy,
and
the
same
with
an
hispanic
who
felt
it
safer
for
him
to
house
with
a
black.
he
could
not
cross
racial
lines
based
upon
the
evidence
in
this
case,
justice
scalia.
that's
correct.
and
the
danger
which
is
created
in
my
judgment
by
a
reliance
upon
a
turner
standard
in
this
circumstance
is
that
all
that
needs
to
be
done
is
a
little
bit
more
of
tinkering
with
the
idea
of
the
equivalence
between
race
and
gang
which
cannot
exist
in
this
record.
and
were
that
to
happen,
we
will
create
a
circumstance
where
the
very
arguments
rejected
in
lee,
indeed
the
very
argument
advanced
by
the
state
of
california
in
this
case,
will
once
again
be
raised
time
and
again,
and
we
will
be
faced
with
a
circumstance
not
too
far
down
the
slippery
slope
where,
for
convenience
or
for
other
reasons
or
for
purely
invidious
reasons,
states
will
be
able
to
return
to
an
era
of
segregation.
this
court's
history
has
demonstrated
a
commitment
to
march
the
country
away
from
the
road
of
segregation,
and
there
should
be
no
turning
back.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
ninth
circuit
has
erred.
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
the
court
should
determine
that
strict
scrutiny
should
apply,
and
it
should
determine
that
petitioner
johnson's
equal
protection
rights
were
violated.
