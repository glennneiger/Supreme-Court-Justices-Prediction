what
is
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why...
why
should
you
use
the
turner
standard?
the
turner
standard
says
to
the
prison,
you
can
do
this
as
long
as
you
have
a
modestly
good
reason.
strict
scrutiny
says
you
have
to
have
a
very
good
reason.
with
free
speech,
of
course,
people
understand
prisons
are
different.
of
course,
people's
speech
rights
will
be
controlled
and
it
won't
hurt
the
rest
of
society.
with
racial
discrimination,
as
you
heard
your
opponents
argue,
it's
a
terrible
symbol,
a
symbol
that
we
would
tolerate
without
the
best
of
reasons
discrimination,
invidious
discrimination,
based
on
race,
which
is
divisive
to
the
whole
society.
now,
that
they
say
is
a
very
good
reason
for
not
applying
the
turner
standard
but,
rather,
applying
strict
scrutiny,
which
gives
you
freedom
to
discriminate
on
this
basis
if
you
can
prove
you
really
have
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
affirmative
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
in
a
title
vii
case
if,
in
fact,
we
meet
just
what
justice
ginsburg
said?
can
you
have
a
jury
trial?
imagine
a
situation,
jury.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
plaintiff
gets
up
and
establishes
the
four
points.
defense.
the
defense
rests.
now,
does
the
judge
send
it
to
the
jury,
or
does
the
judge
direct
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
unusual.
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
are
you
saying,
look,
judge...
imagine
you
had
a
jury
on
this
question.
if
the
defendant
has
made
out
enough
of
a
case
that
you
would
send
it
to
the
jury,
then
go
to
step
two
and
ask
the
questions
as
to
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
it.
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
hicks
does
say
that.
i
think
you're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
suppose
that...
but
wigmore
says
that
the
words,
prima
facie
case,
can
be
used
either
to
describe
the
hicks
situation,
which
is
the
plaintiff
produces
the
four
elements.
the
defendant
sits
silent,
and
the
judge
says,
directed
verdict
for
plaintiff.
that's
what
hicks
seems
to
say.
and
wigmore
says
the
words,
prima
facie
case,
can
mean
that.
but
then
he
says
the
words,
prima
facie
case,
can
also
mean
a
different
thing,
and
the
different
thing
is
what
the
judge
says
then
is,
jury,
you
may
find
for
the
plaintiff,
not
you
have
to.
and
so
i
guess
our
question
is
which
of
the
two
meanings
shall
we
take
here.
and
my
question
to
be...
to
you
is,
why
not
the
second?
after
all,
the
whole
point
of
batson
is
in
suspicious
circumstances
to
explore
matters
further,
and
once
you
get
to
the
point
where
you're
willing
to
tell
a
jury,
jury,
you
may,
you
have
suspicious
circumstances.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it's
not
a
directed
verdict,
then
a
fortiori,
then
every
analogy
works
against
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
assuming
the
four--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--elements,
directed
verdict.
if
you're
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--about
that,
which
is
what
hicks
says--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
have
a
choice,
a
fork
in
the
road.
take
it.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
fork?
and
i
put
the
reason
why.
your
opponents
will
argue,
it
seems
plausibly,
take
the
second
fork
because
we
have
the
suspicious
circumstance.
