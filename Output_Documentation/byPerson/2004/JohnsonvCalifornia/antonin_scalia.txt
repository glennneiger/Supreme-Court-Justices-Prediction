justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
if
there
are
in
these
other
states
the
same
incidents
of
racial
riots
or
racial
killings
or
racial
attacks?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
say
that
that
proves
that
their
policy
is
very
effective.
i
mean,
that's--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is...
what
is
sacrosanct
about
the...
about
the
constitutional
right
not
to
be
subjected
to
racial
stereotype?
there
are
a
lot
of
other
constitutional
rights
that
people
in
prison
give
up.
that's
one
of
the
consequences
of
committing
a
crime
and
being
sent
to
prison,
the
most
fundamental
constitutional
right,
the
right
to...
to
walk
around
and...
and
not
be
seized.
why...
why
is
it
that
this...
this
one
constitutional
right
cannot
yield
to
what
prison
authorities
believe
is...
is
a
useful,
not
necessarily
essential,
but
a
useful
means
of...
of
maintaining
order
in
prison?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it's...
it's
different
from
first
amendment
rights?
prisoners
can't
hold
news
conferences.
i
mean,
there
are
all
sorts
of
very
important
constitutional
rights
that
i
think
are
no
more
important
than
the
equal
protection
clause
which
prisoners
yield
when
they're
in
prison.
now,
do
we
subject
the
taking
away
of
all
of
these
rights
to
strict
scrutiny
when
the
prison
authorities
do
it?
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
we
say
if
it's...
if
it's
the
judgment
of
the...
of
the
prison
authorities,
we...
we
generally
defer
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i...
why
would
holding
a
news
conference
disrupt
a
prison?
it
wouldn't.
you
say
it's
too
much
trouble.
we
don't
want
news
conferences
in
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why
is
this
not
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it...
it
is
no...
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
are
racial
gangs
in
prison,
the
aryan
brotherhood
and...
and
hispanic
gangs
and...
and
black
gangs.
there's
no
doubt
that
that
exists.
is
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't...
you...
you
don't
need
it
in
the
record.
you...
you
know
what
the
aryan
brotherhood
is.
it...
it
is
a
white
group
that
is
hostile
to
blacks
in
particular,
and
you
know
what
the
bloods
are.
it
is
a
black
group
that...
that
is
hostile
to
whites.
and...
and
does
it
take
any
more
than
common
sense
to
know
that
if
you
put
a
tattooed
member
of
one
group
in
with
a
tattooed
member
of
the
other
group,
the
likelihood
of
violence
in
that
cell
is
going
to
be
greater?
and
is
any
more
than
that
needed
for...
for
the...
for
the
prison
not
to
cell
them
together?
would
you
acknowledge
that
at
least
if
the...
not
just
on
the
basis
that
one
is
white
and
one
is
black,
but
if
the
prison
knows
that...
that
one
is
a
member
of
the
aryan
brotherhood
and
the
other
is
a
member
of
the
bloods,
the
prison
can
refuse
to...
to
assign
them
to
the
same
cell?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
say
the
same
about
the
first
amendment,
don't
we?
all
government
actions
restricting
speech
are
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
right?
and
yet,
we
allow
that
to
occur
in
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
unlike
the
first
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
why
should
we
decide
the
constitutional
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
is
not
a
permanent
segregation
in
these
california
prisons.
it's
just
temporary,
isn't
it?
how
long
does
it
last?
justice
antonin
scalia
until...
until
they...
they
have
assurance
that...
that
the
individuals
are...
are
not
members
of
a
gang
and
likely
to,
in...
in
their
view,
commit
racial
violence
if...
if
co-celled
with
another
prisoner.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
were
permanent,
your
argument
about
this,
you
know,
this
is
a
long
tradition
of
our
prisons.
we...
we
keep
the
blacks
and
the
whites
separate.
that...
that's
not
what
they're
doing
in
california.
it's
a
temporary...
it's
a
temporary
measure.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
for
the
whole
stay.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
7...
what
does
7
to
15
days
have
to
do
with
anything?
it
was
for
the
whole
stay
that
they
were
segregated.
the
stay
may
have
been
short,
but
the
fact
that
during
their
entire
period
they
were
segregated
showed
that
there
was
no
other
purpose
to
this
thing
except
to
keep
the
races
separate.
whereas,
here,
they
are
kept
separate
for...
for
the
time
which
the
california
prison
believes
it
needs
in
order
to
assure
that
there
won't
be
violence,
and
once
that
assurance
is
given,
the
races
are...
are
mixed.
that's
a
totally
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
a
high
class
of
felons
in
the
federal
prison
basically.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
don't
understand
too.
that...
that's
really
what
most
troubles
me
about
this
case.
why...
why
do
you
do
this
to
the
transferees
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
house
transferees
only
with
other
transferees,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that...
is
that
too
hard
to
figure
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
in
the
briefs?
i
don't
remember
it
from
the
briefs.
did...
did
you
discuss
this
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
accept
that
this
is
invidious
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race?
what...
what...
why...
why
do
you
think
it's
invidious?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that...
is
that
invidious?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
affirmative
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
do...
do
other
prison
systems
adopt
similar
policies
to
try
to
keep
the
races
mixed
generally
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
thing
would
happen
to
a
white.
it's
not
because
he's
black.
i
mean,
this...
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
he'd
be
able
to
make
the
same
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
very--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
was
just
admiring
your...
your
proposal
in
that
at
least
it
relied
on
something
that
the
lower
courts
are
used
to
applying.
i
mean,
i
guess,
is
there
enough
to
go
to
the
jury?
my
goodness,
it's
a
standard
test.
but
you've
suddenly
destroyed
it
all
by
saying
it
isn't
quite
that
because,
you
know,
if
it's...
if
it's
really
close,
the
tie
goes
to
the
plaintiff,
which
is
an
unusual
way
for
the
tie
to
go.
the
tie
usually
goes
to
the
other
side.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
happens
if
he
doesn't
come
up
with
an
answer
in...
in
this
case?
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
happens
if
the
prosecutor
just
says,
gee,
i...
you
know...
or
the...
the
prosecutor
has
died?
you
know,
it
comes
up
later
in...
in
a
habeas
action.
the
prosecutor
is
dead.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it...
it's
one
hypothesis.
there
is
no
answer
filed
by
the
state
as
to
what
the
real
reason
was.
what
happens?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but...
but
the
refusal
to
answer...
i
just...
you
know,
it
happened
so
long
ago,
your
honor.
i
had
a
lot
of
other...
i...
you
know.
but
it
comes
up
later,
and
he
says
i
just
don't
remember
why
i
challenged
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
remember.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't
think
we've
ever
said
that.
i
thought
we've...
we've
said
to
the
contrary,
that
the
ultimate
question
is
always,
did
the
plaintiff
show
by
a
preponderance
that...
that
the
reason
was
discrimination.
that's
what
i
thought
our...
our
cases
say,
not...
not
automatically
to
punish
the
employer
for
not
giving
a
reason,
he
loses,
which
is
what
you
want
to
do
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
suggest
you
might
have
put
the
high
threshold
because
it's
a
threshold
that
judges
are
familiar
with
and
can
use,
whereas
reason
to
inquire
would
be
a
fine
test
for
when
a
judge
is
permitted
to
demand
a
response
but
it
cannot
possibly
be
a
test
for
when
a
judge
is
required
to
demand
a...
what
does...
what
does
reason
to
inquire
mean?
is
that
a...
is
that
a
standard
that...
that
can
be
applied
in
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
suspicion
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
suspicion...
he
strikes
one
black
from
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
reason
to
inquire.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
other
part
of
your
case,
which
is
that
the
judge
cannot
consider
in...
in
step
one
anything
except
the...
except
the...
the
racial
strikes
and...
and
nothing
else
and
cannot
even
speculate
as
to
what
causes
might
have
produced
the
strikes?
that
seems
to
me
rather
extreme.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
possibly
decide
whether
it...
a
reasonable
juror
could
find
this?
let's
assume
that
all
three
of
the...
of
the
minority,
three
blacks
are
stricken
by
the
prosecution.
the
judge,
the
district
judge,
knows
that
everyone
of
them
is...
is
a...
a
defendant's
lawyer,
every
single
one.
he
has
to
blot
that
out
of
his
mind?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
once...
once
you
have
the
lenient
test
that
you've
established,
why
isn't
it
enough
to
say
even
with
that...
even
with
that
speculation,
a
reasonable
juror
could
find?
once
you
have
that
lenient
test,
i
don't
know
why
you
have
to
exclude
the
speculation.
i
mean,
there...
what
if
all
three
of
the
blacks...
it's
a
case
in
which
the...
the
visual
evidence
is
significant
and
all
three
of
the
blacks
are
blind
and...
and
you
tell
me
the
judge
has
to
say,
oh,
no,
it...
it
can't
be
that...
that
reason
that
they
were
stricken.
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
we
need
the
same...
the
same
rules
for
state
and
federal
courts?
you
have
here
the
california
supreme
court.
why
do
they
have
to
use
the
same...
the
same
minuet
that
the
federal
courts
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but...
but
state
courts
have
different
rules
of
evidence.
they
have
different
rules
of
procedure,
and
we
allow
federal
cases
to
be
determined
under
those
state
rules
of
evidence
and
state
rules
of
procedure
so
long
as
they
provide
due
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't...
why
can't
the
batson
question
similarly
be
decided
but
decided
under
state
rules
of
procedure?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
would
have
no
objection
to
our
limiting
our
opinion,
saying,
you
know,
reversing
and
remanding
and
saying
this
is
not
federal
law.
it's
not
what
we
would
do
in
federal
court.
of
course,
the
california
supreme
court
is
free
to
have
some
different
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
don't
want
us
to
do
that,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you...
you
can
say
that
its
words
say
that,
but
what
it
does
doesn't
say
that.
i
mean,
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case,
all
you
have
to
show
is
that...
that
you
were
qualified
for
the
job,
you're
a
member
of
a
minority,
and
you
weren't
hired,
and
somebody
who's
not
a
member
of
a
minority
was
hired.
do
you
think
that's
enough
to
show
that
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
race
was
the
basis
and
that's...
you
know,
that's
how
those
cases
pan
out?
that's
enough
for
a
prima
facie
case.
is
that
enough
to
say
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
race
was
the
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
really
believe
that?
i
mean,
in...
in
a
large...
you
know,
large...
large
operation,
you...
you're
a
minority.
you
apply
for
a
job.
you're
qualified
for
it.
you
aren't
hired,
but
somebody
who's
not
a
minority
is
hired.
that
alone,
without
any
other
information,
is
enough
to
enable
somebody
to
find
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that...
that
race
was
the
reason?
my
goodness.
i...
i
don't
think
that's
an
accurate
description.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
say
it.
i'm
just
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
question
is
not
what
motivated
the
prosecutor
unless
and
until
the
step
one
showing
can
be
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
the...
the
steps
in
this
case
have
to
be
determined
by
what
we
do
in
title
vii,
that
whatever
we
do
here
should
be...
should
be,
must
be
the
same
as
what
we
do
in
title
vii?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
perhaps
only
for...
for
the
operation
of,
you
know,
what
the
various
steps
are.
you
have
to
go
step
one
first,
step
two
next,
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
lot
of
people
don't
read
footnotes.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
schalit,
can
you
give
me
some
reason
why
i
should
care
a
whole
lot
about
this?
what's
the
big
deal?
i
mean,
so
what
if
we
adopt
a
very
minimal
standard.
so
what.
it
just
means
you
have
a
bench
conference
and
the...
and
the
judge
asks,
you
know...
you
know,
you
struck
three...
three
blacks.
it,
you
know,
looks
suspicious
to
me.
i'm
not
sure
it's
more
likely
than
not.
i'm
not
sure
it's
even
enough
to
go
to
a
jury,
but
it
looks
suspicious
to
me.
why
just...
how
come
you...
you
struck
all
three
blacks
that
were
in
the
venire?
what
is
such
a
big
deal
about
adopting
a
very...
a
very
low
standard?
justice
antonin
scalia
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
like...
like
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
agree.
of
course,
the
state
has
a...
has
an
interest
in...
in
exercising
peremptories.
but...
but
why
is
it
important
that
whether
the
state
is
doing
it
in
a
biased
fashion
be
decided
up
front
at
step
one
instead
of
having
the
parties
come
to
the
judge
and
say,
you
know,
why
did
you
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
can't
understand,
why
that
is
so
important
to
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
batson
overruled
that.
i
mean,
those
days
are
gone.
tell
california
to
stop
worrying
about
that.
[laughter]
you
cannot
make
peremptory
challenges
for
any
reason
anymore.
you
can't
do
it
for
any
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they're
gone.
now,
once
you
acknowledge
they're
gone,
what's
the
big
deal
about...
about
having
the
parties
come
up
to
the
judge
and
just
explain
to
the
judge,
we
didn't
do
it
for
a
racial
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
new
hampshire
rule.
[laughter]
