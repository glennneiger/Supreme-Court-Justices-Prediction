ms.
frances
t.
grunder
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
turner's
unitary
deferential
standard
of
review
balances
inmates'
rights
with
the
exceptionally
dangerous
and
difficult
job
of
running
a
prison.
the
turner
standard
applies
here
because
the
need
for
prison
deference
doesn't
change
with
the
nature
of
the
right
asserted.
california
is
ground
zero
for
raced-based
prison
and
street
gangs.
the
aryan
brotherhood,
the
black
guerilla
family,
the
mexican
mafia,
and
the
nuestra
familia--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--in
the
reception
center,
your
honor?
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
in
the
reception
centers?
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
no,
because
the...
the
inmates
are
not
interracially
housed.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor.
the
policy
has
been
in
effect
for
a
considerable
length
of
time,
and...
and
during
that
time,
they
have
not
interracially
housed
inmates
in
the
same
cell.
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
here
that
the
policy
only
applies
in
the
reception
center
areas
and
in
the
cells.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
it's
a
very
shortened
period
for
a
transferee.
it's
only
14
days
under
the
california
regulations,
and
it
only
applies
if
they
are
put
in
a
cell.
if
there
is
someone
who
is
eligible
to
be
housed
in
a
dormitory,
that
is,
somebody
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
less
violent
offense
or
they
have
more
information
about,
then
the
dormitories
are
fully
integrated,
as
well
as
every
other
aspect
of
the
reception
center.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
there's
a...
there's
a
couple
of
reasons,
your
honors.
first
of
all,
as
much
as
you
may
know
about
the
transferring
individual,
you
may
not
know
the
information
about
their
prospective
cellmate
at
the
transfer
institution
because
they
may
be
somebody
who's
a
newly
received
cellmate,
somebody
who
is
going
through
a
reception
center
process
themselves.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
what
happens
when
they
arrive
at
the
receiving
institution
is
there
needs
to
be
time
for
a
record
review.
the
records
do
not
arrive
at
the
exact
same
time
as
the
inmates.
and
so
they
convene
a
classification
committee
and
at
which
point
they
review
the
records.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
the
records
need
to
stay
with
the
inmate
at
the
old
prison
until
the
inmate
leaves
on
the
bus
for
the
new
prison
because--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--well,
in
the
case
of
california,
there's
over
165,000
inmates.
in
mr.
johnson's
case,
his
records
probably
are
many,
many
banker's
boxes
full
of
records.
so
that's
the
type
of--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--he
may
be
housed
with
new
entrants
into
the
system
and
that...
that's
the
reason--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
would
like
to--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--that's--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--that's
possible,
your
honor.
that
currently
is
not
the
practice,
but
that
is
possible.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
it
is...
yes,
it
is
a
practice.
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
a
policy.
it's
a
practice.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
yes,
they
do,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to
address
that.
the
two
largest
states
of
inmate
population,
california
and
texas,
together
comprise
about
300,000
inmates,
which
is
about
20
percent
of
the
total
inmate
prison
population
in
the
united
states,
including
the
bureau
of
prisons.
those
two
states
have
a
similar
policy.
in
addition,
oklahoma--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--yes,
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
when
texas
was
subjected
to
the
integration
decree,
the
one
area
of
the
prison
that
was
not
part
of
the
decree
that
they
did
not
require
them
to
integrate
was
the
area
that
is
the
equivalent
of
our
reception
center.
there...
there
in--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is
in
the
briefs.
it's...
it
has
to
do
with
the
trulson
study,
and
the
trulson
study
indicated
that
the
intake
diagnostic
centers
of
texas
were
not
required
to
be
integrated.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
your
honor,
actually
there's
another
state,
oklahoma,
which
has
a
very
similar
policy
that
says
that--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--well,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
they
don't
have
the
same
problems
that
california
has.
california
has
the
most
prison
gangs,
the...
they
are
race-based.
it's
an
extraordinarily
difficult
situation.
and
even
the
bureau
of
prisons
takes
race
into
account
when
it
balances
its
prisons
and
that's
in
the
united
states'
brief.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
yes,
your
honor.
the
trulson
study,
however,
only
looked
at
inmates
after
they
had
left
the
reception
center,
only
looked
at
inmates
in...
in
the
integrated
settings
of
the
prison,
equivalent
to
the
areas
that
california
integrates.
so
we
don't
dispute
that
once
you
have
enough
individualized
information
about
an
inmate,
then
you
can
house
them
according
to
an
individualized
information.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
it
would
have
a
fair
amount
of
information.
however,
in
california,
the
presentence
report
does
not
always
accompany
the
inmate
and
frequently
does
not.
it
follows
some
period
of
time
later
from
the
county.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
your
honor,
the
counties
aren't
preparing
the
presentences...
presentence
reports
in
a
timely
fashion,
and...
and
they're
not
sending
them--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--yes,
with
the
counties,
perhaps.
but
another
issue
with
the
presentence
report
is
it
doesn't
deal
with
in-prison
behavior,
and
that's
what
the
prison
officials
need
a...
need
time
to
take
a
look
at,
is
how
the
inmate
is
going
to
react
once
they
get
in
the
prison
environment,
which
is
a
wholly
different
environment
than
a
jail
environment.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
no,
your
honor,
because
in
prison
the
animosity
between
the
gangs
is
purely
race-based,
and
that
inmate
may
be
subjected--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--there's
not
a
presumption
that
the
person
is
a
member
of
the
gang.
but
there
is
a
presumption--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--that
may
be,
but
there
is
also
a
danger
that
if
he
is
housed
interracially
and
subjected
to
gang
pressures
on
the
yard,
that
he
will
then
be
in
a
situation
to
go
back
to
his
cell,
when
the
door
is
closed
and
the
lights
are
out,
and
commit
violent
acts
upon
his
cellmate
at...
because
of
pressures
that
he's
receiving
from
members
of
his
own
race.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
in
the
reception
centers,
no.
the...
it
has
been
a
policy
of
not
cross-racially
housing
the
inmates
in
the
cells
only.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
yes,
i
think
that's
true.
and
there's
also
a
difference
i
think
in
the
attitude
of...
of
the
inmates
when
they're
in...
in
a
state
of
flux
in
a
jail
as
opposed
to
when
they
arrive
to
serve
their
many
years-long
sentence,
in
the
case
of
mr.
johnson,
37
years
to
life.
and
then
i
think
the
reality
sets
in
and...
and
things
do
change.
prison
is
very
different.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
yes,
i...
i
believe
it
is.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
well,
the
reality
in
prison
is
that
people
are
pressured
to
join
gangs
and
to...
you
either
hang
with
your
own
or
you
don't
and--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--yes,
it's
true.
but
even
for
members...
people
who
are
not
actually
members
of
the
gang
are
subjected
to
the
gang
pressures.
for
instance,
if...
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
fight,
a
planned
fight,
that
was
going
to
break
out
on
a
yard,
members
of
a
prison
gang
would
tell
members
of...
of
their
same
race
that
once
the
fight
breaks
out,
you
better
be
with
us
because
if
you're
not,
we'll
deal
with
you
later.
and
that's
even
for
people
who
aren't
gang
members.
so
the
racial
pressures
in
prison
are
very,
very
severe.
something--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--and
he
may
well
be,
your
honor,
but
what--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--but
you...
but
to
do
that
would
be
to
invite
danger
to
the...
to
the
other
inmate.
the...
the
level
of
interracial
violence
in
prison
is
high,
and
that
can't
be
disregarded.
and
if
we
weren't
here
today--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--there
hasn't,
as...
as
we've
talked
about,
been
a
problem
with
interracial
violence
in
the
cells
because
they're
not
housed
that
way.
there
are
problems
with--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--in
general.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
there
are
some
problems
with
intraracial
violence,
but
they're
generally
more
founded
in
personal
relations
as
opposed
to
a
race-based...
you
know,
some
other
sort
of
animosity.
the
same
sort
of
reasons
that
people
have
fights
on
the
outside--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--no,
your
honor.
in
this
case
there's...
it's
not
in
the
record.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
what
we
do
have
in
the
record,
your
honor,
is
that
the
policy
and
the
practice
does
not
apply
after
the
60
days.
inmates
are
allowed
to
request
a
cell
together
and
can
choose
their
own
cellmates
so
long
as
the
other
cellmate
agrees.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
we
do,
your
honor.
the...
it
is
not...
it
does
not
happen
outside
of
the
reception
center
cell
practice.
once
they
get
to
their
permanent
housing
assignment,
they
may
choose
their
own
cellmates.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
two
members
of
the
same
gang?
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
it...
it
would
depend
on
if
they
are...
what
level
of
gang
membership
they
are.
california
has
a
very
complex
system
for
what...
doing
what
they
call
validating
gang
membership.
if
they
are
a
validated
gang
member,
generally
they
are
sent
to
a
special
prison,
and
yes,
they
are
housed
with
members
of
their
own
gangs
in
a
very
high
security
setting.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
we
don't
have
any
record
of
that,
but
i...
i
can
tell
you
that
if
members
of
opposing
gangs
were
to
request
a
cell
together,
first
of
all,
they
would
both
have
to
agree,
which
would
be
highly
unlikely,
and
there...
it
would
probably
be
viewed
with
a
bit
of
suspicion
as
to
what
was
going
on.
but
maybe
if...
if
they
had
disavowed
their
gang
membership
and...
and
these
particular
people
could
get
along,
it
would
certainly
be
considered.
the...
the
object,
once
they
get
to
the
permanent
housing,
is
cellmate
compatibility.
so
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
are
looked
at.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
i
do
not
agree
with
counsel.
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
properly
apply
the
turner
standard
in
this
case
and
that
california
would
pass
and
does
pass
the
turner
test
in
this
case.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
well,
it
may
be
more
than
just
administrative
efficiency
because
every
prison
is
different
and
there
are
different
gang
pressures
at
each
prison.
and
i
think
it's
important
for
the
prison
to
be
allowed
an
opportunity
to
bring
that
transferred
inmate
in
and
look
at
them
and
how
they're
going
to
fit
into
that
prison
and
have
a
chance
to
evaluate
their
records.
it's
true
that--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
the
officials
have
deemed
that
that
is
an
appropriate
policy.
i
think
the
record
is
a
bit
scant
in
this
case.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
not
with
respect
to
the
transferees,
your
honor,
and
it's
true
that
the
transfer
policy
certainly
is
more
in
jeopardy
under
the
turner
standard.
but
the...
the
overall
policy
of
considering
race
when
there
is
a...
a
lack
of
information
certainly
would
pass
the
turner
standard
and
should
pass
the
turner
standard
as
it
was
properly
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
it's
multi-fold,
your
honor.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
it's
multi-fold.
the
purpose
is
multi-fold.
first,
yes,
it
is
to
protect
the
inmate
from...
from
having
harm
done
to
him
in
the
cell,
which
is
a
very
difficult
area
to
protect.
it's
a
small
area
and
not
easily
visible
into
the...
into
the
cell
directly.
also,
that's
where
they
sleep,
so
at
some
point
the
lights
will
be
out.
so
it's
a
very
difficult
situation.
also,
they're
afraid...
and
this
is
in
the
record
from
the
testimony
of
the
officials...
that
there
will
be
a
ripple
effect
and
that
interracial
violence,
if
they
were
to
cell
them
together,
would
spill
out
onto
the
yards
and
create
the
exact
ripple
effect
that
turner...
is
one
of
the
considerations
in
the
turner
test.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
yes,
your
honors,
at
page
41
of
the
brief.
it
would
be
the...
the
second
paragraph
where
they
examine
double-celling
only
after
initial
screening.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
and
also
note
13
of
the
trulson
study
indicates
that
it
did
not
apply
in
texas'
equivalent
of
california's
reception
centers.
the
turner
standard
is
the
appropriate
standard
here
because
it
does
give
the
prison
officials--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
well,
in
this
case
the
inmate
put
forth
no
experts
of
any
kind.
there
was
an
opportunity
for
the
inmate
to
rebut
the
evidence
put
forth
by
the
prison
officials,
and...
and
there
was
no
evidence
submitted.
so
in
this
case
he
didn't--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--that
would
be
one
way,
your
honor.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
well,
the
texas
study
doesn't...
doesn't
apply
to
the
initial
intake
process.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
no,
your
honor.
actually
this
policy
was
applied
in
a
california
case
after
the
johnson
case
was
decided
in
california
to
strike
down
a
race-based
prison
policy.
so
there...
there
certainly
are
instances
when
the
inmate
could--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--well,
the
same
way
the
inmate
would
do
it
in
any
other
litigation
that
is
brought
by
an
inmate.
the
burden
is
on
a
litigant
to
prove
their
case,
and
it
doesn't
change
because
that
litigant
is
in
prison.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
unlike
in
a
non-prison
setting,
there
aren't
other
rights
to
be
balanced.
in
the
prison
setting,
not
only
are
you
balancing
the
inmate's
right
to
be
free
from
discrimination,
but
you're
balancing
the...
the
rights
of
all
inmates
to
be
free
from
harm,
and
as
well
as
the
prison
officials'
duty
to
protect
them
from
harm.
and
that
is
what--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--well,
there's...
there's
no...
the
prison
officials
here
have
an
affirmative
duty
to
protect
the
other
inmates
under
the
eighth
amendment,
and--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--we
don't
think
it's
invidious,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--this
is
not
affirmative
action,
no.
it
is
not
invidious,
justice
scalia.
it
is
simply
one
consideration
of
race
to
control
violence
in
prison,
and
as
the
bureau
of
prisons
uses
in...
in
its
prisons,
they
in
the
united
states'
brief
say
that
they
consider
race
to
maintain
racial
balance
in
their
prisons
for
the
purpose
of
diversity.
california
also
considers
race
in
maintaining
racial
balance
in
its
prisons,
not
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
diversity,
but
for
prison
safety
to
make
sure
that
no
one
group
takes
over
a
prison,
thus
putting
members
of
another
group
in
a
vulnerable
situation.
there
are
many
circumstances
when...
when
race
should
be--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
no.
there
are
many
instances
in
which
race
needs
to
be
considered
on
a
day-to-day
basis
in
prison.
for
instance,
when
the
prisoners
line
up
to
go
to
the
exercise
yard,
if
10
white
prisoners
line
up
first
and
the
11th
prisoner
in
line
is
an
african
american,
it
would
be
extraordinarily
ill-advised
to
release
those
prisoners
in
the
manner
in
which
they
have
lined
up
to
go
to
yard.
it
would
require
some
reshuffling
and
maybe
even
some
shifting
of
prisoners
from
yard
to
yard
based
on
their
race
because
to
do
that
would
put
the
minority
member
at
extreme
risk.
turner
is
the
appropriate
test
here
because
courts--
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
--it
would
be
dangerous
for
the
officer
to
release
the
inmates
onto
the
yard
in
the
manner
that
they
had
self-arrayed
because
then
you
would
put
10
members
or
more
of
one
group
on
the
yard
and
then
introduce
another
member
to
the
yard
who
was
not
a
member
of
that
group,
and
that
would
be
very
dangerous
for
the...
the
sole
person
on
the
yard.
ms.
frances
t.
grunder
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
as
i
pointed
out,
bureau
of
prisons
being
one.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
u.s.
department
of
justice's
national
corrections
institute
statistics...
and
this
is
not
a
part
of
the
record...
indicate
that
96
percent
of
all
states
separate
prisoners
based
on
disruptive
group
or
gang
orientation.
so
california
is
not
alone
in
that.
it's
a...
it's
done
to
prevent
violence
to
other
prisoners.
in
sum,
turner
is
the
only
test
that
provides
the
flexibility
that
prison
officials
need
to
safely
manage
their
prisons
and
protect
inmates
from
harm.
the
court
should
apply
it
here
and
affirm
the
lower
court.
thank
you.
