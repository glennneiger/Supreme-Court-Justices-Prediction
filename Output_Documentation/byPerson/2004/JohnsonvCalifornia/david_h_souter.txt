justice
david
h.
souter
may...
may
i
put
aside
for
a
moment
the
question
of
the
strength
of
your
argument
in
transfer
situations
and
simply
go
to
the
circumstances
of
the
original
receipt
of
the
prisoner
for
the
first
time
into
the
prison
system?
what
do
the
other
states...
you
say
california
is
the
only
one
that...
that
makes
this
racial
assignment
like
this.
what
do
the
other
states
do
to
guard
against
an...
an
explosive
team-up
in...
in
double-celled
prisoners
when...
when
they're
taking
them
in
for
the
first
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
it
be
a
proper
analysis
simply
to...
to
separate
or
not
based
on
gang
membership?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
stands
on
that.
so
you
would
not
be
making
an
argument
that
gang
membership
is
merely
a
surrogate
for
race
in
that
case
if
that
were
the
policy.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
there
an
argument
to
be
made
that
the
reason
we
make
that
emphasis
and...
and
an
argument
for
you
in
this
case
that
there
is
somehow
a
greater
fragility
to...
to
the
effective
standards
to
prevent
racial
classification
than
there
is
to
the
possibility
of
enforcing
speech
rights
and
so
on?
is
there
something
to
worry
about
here
more
than
in
the
case
of...
of
enumerated
rights
that...
that
gets
the
turner
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
there's
a
pretty
frightening
history
about
speech
restriction
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
we
didn't
announce
a
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
i'm
sorry.
even
in
the
case
of...
of
housing
in
cells,
what's
the
justification
for
it?
the
argument
is...
excuse
me...
on
the
initial
intake,
we
don't
know
enough
about
them.
well,
on...
on
the
transfer,
you've
had
plenty
of
time
to
know
about
them.
why
is
it
justifiable
even
for
14
days
on...
on
the
transfer?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
unless
you
house
them
with
the
cellmate,
what
are
you
going
to
learn
from
segregating
them
for
14
days?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
we
have
a
choice
between
segregating
by
race
and
speeding
up
the
delivery
of
records,
isn't
it
constitutionally
preferable
to
get
the
records
delivered
on
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
don't
you
have
xeroxes?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
if
we...
if
we
exclude
texas
and
california,
on
your
recording,
we've
still
got
80
percent
of
the...
the
prison
population
in
the
united
states,
and
apparently
neither
the
federal
prisons
nor
any
state
does...
apart
from
texas,
has
this
policy.
why...
i
mean,
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
evidence
that...
that
they
are
having
explosive
incidents
involving
new
members
based
upon
racial
animosity?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
we've
still
got
47
states
left.
[laughter]
how...
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that...
and...
and
some
of
them
don't
have
your
racial
problems.
there's
no
question
about
it.
i
come
from
one
that
does
not.
but
some
do.
and...
and
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
there
is
no
sort
of
confirmatory
record
of
what
happens
when
you
don't
follow
your
policy?
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
said
a
second
ago
that
there's
a
significant
difference
between
the
conditions
in
the
jails
and
the
conditions
in...
in
the
prisons.
is
that
significant
difference
the...
the
organization
of...
of
racially
based
gangs
in
the
prisons
as
distinct
from
the
jails?
justice
david
h.
souter
apart
from
the
gang
situation,
is
there
reason
to
think
that
their
minds
change
in
the
sense
of
inclining
them
to
interracial
violence
simply
because
they
say,
gee,
i'm
in
for
a
long
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
do
we
have
any
evidence
to
that
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that...
i
mean,
that
goes
back
to
the
gang
membership
situation.
it
seems
to
me
that's
your
strongest
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
when...
when
they
do
choose
that,
do
you
respect
a
choice
to
cell
with...
with
another
member
of...
of
the...
of...
do
you
respect
the
choice
when
two
members
of
a
gang
want
to
cell
together?
justice
david
h.
souter
same
gang.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you...
do
you
have
a...
do
you
have
any
record
of...
of
requests
by
different...
members
of
different
gangs
to
cell
together?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
wouldn't...
it
wouldn't
pass
if...
would
it,
if
we
do
not
accept
your
argument
that
california
cannot
efficiently
get
records
sent
along
with
inmates
so
that,
at
the
time
at
least
of
transfers,
the
prisons
are
in
a
position
to
know
what
they're
getting?
if
we...
if
we
say,
look,
we're
not
going
to
accept
the
argument
from
administrative
efficiency,
then
you
can't
survive
turner,
can
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no.
i
don't
want
to
cut
your
argument
short,
but
here's
what's
bothering
me.
i...
i
can
see
there's
a
possible
plausibility
in
what
you're
saying,
but
in
fact
is
that
the
reason?
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
that
is
necessary
in
transfer
situations?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
look,
if...
if
we
accept
that
officials
have
deemed
it,
we
will
not
have
many
arguments
in...
in
this
court.
i
mean,
they
will
be
over
before
they
start.
i...
i
mean,
we've
got
to
have
something
more
than
simply
the
decision
under
attack.
is
there
anything
more
in
this
case
in...
with
respect
to
the
transferee
situation?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i...
may
i
go
back
to
your
answer
to
the...
the
question
whether
in
the
absence
of
an
answer,
there
is
a
presumption
of
a
batson
violation,
and
you
said,
no,
there
isn't
a
presumption--
justice
david
h.
souter
--where
the
court
has
still
ultimately
got
to
decide
it?
what
sorts
of
things
could
the
court
consider
when
it
ultimately
decides?
justice
david
h.
souter
at
step
three.
we've...
we've
gotten
to
step
three.
justice
david
h.
souter
step
one,
whatever
the
standard
is,
it
has
been
met.
step
two,
silence.
we
get
to
step
three.
what
does
the
court
consider
at
step
three?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
zero.
which
is
silence.
there
is
no
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
what
i'm
getting
at
is
let's
assume
he
doesn't
draw
that
inference.
ultimately
at
step
three,
he
says,
no.
i
am
going
to
reject
the
challenge.
i
do
not
think
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
has
been
met.
what...
what
considerations
might
lead
him
to
do
that,
assuming
that
step
one
has
been
satisfied?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let
me--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let
me
suggest
this.
wouldn't...
wouldn't
he
almost
necessarily
have
to
consider
at
step
three
those
reasons
that
the
prosecutor
has
not
given,
but
which
he
thinks
might
be
good
reasons
for
the
challenge
which
do
not
raise
batson
discrimination?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
that's
what
i'm...
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
and...
and
what
i'm
troubled
by
is
i...
i
take
your...
i
understand
your
point,
that
it's
not
appropriate
for
him
to
speculate
and
supply
an
answer
at
stage
two.
but
if
stage
one...
at
stage
one,
the
objector
has
satisfied
the
test
and
at
stage
three,
the...
the
court
may,
nonetheless,
reject
the
challenge,
i
don't
know
what
he
would
be
rejecting
the
challenge
for
unless
it
is
on
the
basis
of
this
kind
of,
as
you
put
it,
speculation
about
what
the
reasons
might
be.
so
help
me
out
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
don't
you
have
to
say
at
that
stage,
if
there
is
silence
on
the
part
of
the
government,
he's
got
to
find
the
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
he
doesn't
have
to,
he's
got
to
have
some
reason
for
doing
it.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
whim.
and
if
he's
got
to
have
a
reason
and
his
reasons
may
not
legitimately
be
those
speculations
on
what
might
be
a
legitimate
basis
for
the
challenge,
but
which
were
never
raised
by
the
state,
and
you
can't
think
of
any
other
reasons...
and
i
admit
i
can't
right
now...
then
it
seems
to
me
that
he
would
pretty...
it
would...
it
would
follow
that...
that
he
would
be
required
to...
to
uphold
the
challenge.
justice
david
h.
souter
could...
could
i
take
that
a
step
further?
would
this...
would
this
be
a...
a
fair
summary
of...
of
your
position
on
all
the
steps?
step
one,
there
must
be
enough
that
would
justify
sending
the
question
to
the
jury
if
it
were
a
jury
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
number
two,
if
there
is
silence
at
stage
two
or
in
justice
scalia's
example,
the
prosecutor
just
can't
remember,
and
we
then
go
to
stage
three,
your
position
is
as
follows.
at
stage
three,
number
one,
there
is
enough...
there
is
enough
evidence
on
the
record
from
which
the
judge
can
find
a
batson
violation.
number
two,
there
is
a
state
of
the
evidence
from
which
he
is
not
required
to
find
a
batson
violation.
sometimes,
maybe
most
times,
the
prosecutor's
silence
will
be
a
reason
to
find
a
batson
violation,
in
addition
to
those
that
were
stated
at
stage
one.
and
finally,
theoretically...
theoretically
even
with
the
prosecutor's
silence,
the
evidence
at
stage
one,
sufficient
as
it
might
be
to
get
to
the
jury,
will
not
be
persuasive.
and
there
may
be
outlying
cases
in
which,
even
with
prosecutorial
silence,
the
court
will
say
i
don't
see
the
batson
violation
shown
here.
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
step
one
was
evidence
from
which
it
could
be
found
more
likely
than
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
doesn't
have
to
prove
more
likely
than
not
at
stage
one,
as
i
understand
your
position.
he
has
to
put
in
enough
evidence
from
which
a
fact
finder
could
find
more
likely
than
not
if
he
accepts
all
the
evidence
as
true
and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
dog
is
entitled
to
one
bite.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
say,
the
dog
is
entitled
to
one
bite.
