bader

were
there
any
incidents
in
california's
prisons
of
same
cellmates
of
different
races
having
episodes
of
violence?
or...
this
is
an
old
policy.
so
were
there
incidents
like
that
that
led
to
the
development
of
the
policy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i...
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
i
understand
the...
your
position
that
turner
is
enough
to
cover
to
this,
but
you're
going-in
position
was
that
race
is
different,
even
different
than
the
first
amendment.
and
you
gave
one
other
example,
the
eighth
amendment.
it
may
be
convenient,
make
things
easier
for
the
administration
of
a
prison
if
prisoners
are
tortured
every
now
and
then
to
keep
them
in
line,
but
obviously,
the
eighth
amendment
prevails
over
that.
is
there
anything
else
that
you
say
is...
is
so
fundamental
that
we
don't
do
it,
like
torture?
and...
and
you
say
race
segregation
belongs
in
that
category.
anything
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of...
one
of
california's
response
said,
well,
the
feds
have
mostly
income
tax
evaders,
maybe
some
drug
dealers,
but
the
state
prisoners
are
the
real
tough
guys,
the
real
violent
criminals.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
go
back
to
texas?
because
one
of
the
pieces
of
information
that
was
featured
by
the
other
side
was
this
study
in
texas
that
showed
a
decline
in
interracial
violence
when
there
was
an
increase
in
racial
integration.
so
that
empirical
study
showed
just
the
opposite,
that
when
you
integrate,
you
get
less
violence
than
when
you
separate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
individualized,
there
was
something
that
i
didn't
grasp.
you
say
we
don't
know
anything
about
these
people,
so
we
have
to
have
that
60-day
period
to
find
out
about
them.
the
presentence
report
we're
told
accompanies
the
conviction,
the
prisoner's
conviction.
so
the
presentence
report
will
have
a
fair
amount
of
information
about
the
offender,
will
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
again,
that's
the
kind
of
administrative
problem
that
would
seem
easily
fixable.
i
thought
the...
the
rule
or
the
regulation
was
that
the
presentence
report
is
supposed
to
accompany
the
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
something
should
be
done
about
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
compare
to
intraracial
violence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--overall.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there...
is
there
any
figures
on
the
prison
population
as
a
whole,
the
incidents
of
interracial
violence
as
opposed
to
intraracial
violence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
do
we
know...
does
this
record
tell
us
what
happens
after
the
60
days?
to
what
extent
where
there
are
double
cells,
does
the
same
race
policy,
although
not
formally
adopted,
continue?
after
the
60
days,
what
is
the
incidence
of
different
race
double-celling
and
same
race
double-celling?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
just
don't
have
any
information
whether
this
line
between
the
60
days
is
imaginary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
was
something--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--let...
let
me
ask--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--about
that
standard
at
least
as
the
ninth
circuit
applied
it.
they
said
that
you
presume
the
practice
constitutional
and
the
challenger
has
the
burden
to
show
that
if
there
were
no
segregation
by
race,
that
violence
would
not
increase.
now,
how
does
someone
go
about
proving
that
negative?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
would
an
inmate
who
was
objecting
to
this
racial
segregation
go
about
proving
such
a
case?
you
said
one
would
have
to
rely
on
experts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
one
could
put
in
that
texas
study,
but
you
said
that
wouldn't
be
good
enough.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you...
you...
supposing
an
inmate
who
would
have
to
call
a
bevy
of
experts
that
he
has
no
wherewithal
to...
to
pay
for...
i
mean,
you
are
essentially
saying
an
inmate
cannot
challenge
this
policy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
asked
how
would
an
inmate
prove
this,
and
you
said
you
would
need
experts.
so
for
experts,
you
need
money
to
pay
experts.
how
does
an
inmate
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bedrick,
in
your
brief
you
were
very,
it
seemed,
uncomfortable
about
addressing
this
question.
you
said
it's
just
like
you
go
through
the
same
litany
as
title
vii,
that
is,
the
plaintiff
meets
a
burden
which
is
in
title
vii
very
easy
to
meet--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--stage
one.
then
the
defendant
has
to
come
up
with
a
nondiscriminatory
reason,
and
then
you
find
out
if
that
was
pretext.
you
kept
saying
in
your
brief
what
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
you
have
never
seen
a
case.
you
said
it
never
happens.
it
never
happens
that
the
prosecutor
stands
silent.
so
this
is
a
hypothetical,
academic
question.
but
i
think
you're
being
pressed
to
say,
well,
suppose
it
does
happen,
and
i
take
it
that
your
answer
is
in
that
case
the
person
who's
raising
the
batson
challenge
wins.
but
you're...
you're
not
willing
to
say
certainly.
i
mean,
you
seem
to
say...
well,
why
are
you
uncertain?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
suppose
you
had
in
a
title
vii
case
the
employer
says,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
a
nondiscriminatory
reason.
you...
you've
gone
through
the
mcdonnell
douglas.
the
plaintiff
has
shown
those
four
things.
the
employer
says,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
any
reason.
then
what
happens?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
sometimes
even
when
you're
not
involved
with
a
constitutional
question,
if
you
have
a
federal
claim
in
a
state
court...
byrd
against
blue
ridge
is
one
example...
the
federal
procedure...
that
the
state
procedure
needs
to
be
modified
so
it's
in
sync
with
the
federal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a
question
of
what
kind
of
questions
go
to
juries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
state
said
ordinarily
we
don't
give
this
kind
of
question
to
the
jury,
but
we're
dealing
with
a
federal
claim,
and
the
federal
procedure
trumps.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
in...
in
the
title
vii
context,
certainly
you
don't
have
to
show
more
likely
than
not
to
get
past
the
initial
threshold.
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
make
four
showings
that...
that
federal
courts
have
recognized
are
rather
easily
made.
so
the
real
show
doesn't
come
until
the
pretext
stage.
but
it's
not
that
you
have
to
show
anything
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that...
you
don't
have
to
show
discrimination
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
under
title
vii.
you
just
have
to
show
four
things
from
which
someone
may
but
not
must
infer
discrimination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
all
it
did
was
shift
the
burden
of
production
to
the
defendant.
it
doesn't...
the
showing
at
stage
one
doesn't
involve
the
burden
of
persuasion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
here
there
was
no
reason
given.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
shouldn't
this
operate
as
so
many
things
do
in...
in
an
unfolding
proceeding?
if
someone
stands
silent...
and
we're
not
involved
with
a
fifth
amendment
privilege...
there's
an
inference...
an
adverse
inference.
worse,
take
a...
a
discovery
and
one
plaintiff
asks
for
discovery
from...
from
the...
the
defendant,
and
the
defendant
says,
sorry,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
what
you
want.
what
is
the
consequence
of
that
if
the
defendant,
being
presented
with
a
opportunity
or
a
requirement
to
give
a
reason
or
to
produce
something,
says,
i
won't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
of
them,
if
we're
going
to
continue
with
that
analogy
to
someone
who
says
i
won't
make
discovery,
is
not
just
an
inference
but
that
you
take
what
the
opposing
party
says
to
be
true
on
that
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
not...
not
issue
preclusion.
i
mean,
this
is...
that
is...
the
defendant
who
stands
silent
is
going
to
lose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may...
may
i
just--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ask
you
to
clarify
one
thing?
i...
i
take
it
from
what
you've
said,
although
i
didn't
understand
it
from
your
brief,
that
california
doesn't
have
any
different
standard,
that
they
are
following
the
same
standard
that
would
be
applicable
in
federal
court
on
a
batson
challenge.
or
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
not
arguing
that
states
have
flexibility
to
apply
batson
according
to
different
procedural
rules.
you're
arguing
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
wrong
about
what
the
federal
standard
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
still
could
be...
i
mean,
you're
not
taking
away
the
peremptory.
you're
saying
the...
the
prosecutor
can
give
a
reason
and
the
judge
says,
okay,
that
passes.
it
wouldn't
pass
for
a
challenge
for
cause,
but
as
a
peremptory,
it's
okay.
