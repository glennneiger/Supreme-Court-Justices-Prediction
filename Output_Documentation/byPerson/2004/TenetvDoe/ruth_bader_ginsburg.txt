justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
clarify
on
the
employment
question
something
else?
it's...
it's
in
your
reply
brief
and
you
say
you're
contrasting
this
type
of
claim
with
a
title
vii
claim
which...
in
which
you
say
that
the
court
in
webster
relied
on
the
cia's
historical
practice
of
litigating
employment
disputes.
the
cia's
historical
practice,
not
the
court's
rulings.
are
you
suggesting
that
even
with
respect
to
employment
litigation,
it's
up
to
the
cia
to
decide
what
its
practice
will
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can...
can
we
go
back
to
the...
another
threshold
question?
you
did
press
below
and
judge
tallman
urged
that
the
reason
this
case
can't
be
in
the
district
court
in
california,
or
wherever,
is
it
has
to
be
in
the
federal
circuit.
this
is
a
contract
claim
against
the
government.
are
you
abandoning
that
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
free...
are
you
free
to
abandon
it?
is
the...
is
the
government's
surrender
of
its
immunity
from
suit
for
contracts,
provided
that
the
suit
is
brought
in
the
federal
circuit...
is
that
something
that
you
are
free...
congress
having
said
that,
that
the
executive
is
free
to
say,
well,
we
could
take
advantage
of
that,
but
we
don't
want
to?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
making
that
statement
with
respect
to
anything
that's
classified.
there
was
something
in
your
brief,
reply
brief,
at
18
and
19
in
which
you...
you
cite
reynolds
and
you
say
the
proper
response
to
classified
information
in
civil
litigation
is
to
disregard
the
classified
information,
not
to
order
partial
disclosure
to
court
personnel.
are...
are
you
saying
then
in
all
of
civil
litigation
if
information
is
classified,
then
it's
just
out
of
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
attached
to
what?
i
mean,
you
can...
a
fair
procedure
leading
nowhere
is
not
a
claim.
you
have
a
right
to
a
fair
procedure
because
it's
attached
to
some
substantive
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
still
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
create
a
property
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
property
right
is
the
contract
with
the
united
states.
i
mean,
you
can't
get
away
from
the
contract
by
calling
it
a
property
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
the
court...
a
court
go
about
monitoring
this
fair
procedure--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
then
you...
you
said
that...
suppose
you
knew
what
it
was
on
paper
and
then
you
wanted
to
complain
to
a
court,
that's
not
what
they
gave
us.
they
said
that
in
their
regulations,
but
they
gave
us
something
much
less.
