justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
want
to
ask
one
question.
don't
they
have
a
claim
interpreted
favorably
to
them
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
contract,
totally
nothing?
okay?
but
there
happen
to
be
some
rules
over
there
in
the
cia
in
their
books
somewhere,
which
we've
never
read,
and
they
say
when
we
use
a
foreign
person
as
a
spy,
we'll
pay
him
some
money
or
we
give
him
something.
we
have
some
procedures.
now,
we
don't
have
to
do
that
as
a
matter
of
contract.
we
don't
have
to
do
it
at
all,
but
we
do
it.
and
so
there's
a
claim
here
that
we
want
to
see
that
they're
following
their
own
rules.
they
say
totten
doesn't
apply
to
that
because
totten
is
about
contracts.
our
claim
isn't
about
contracts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
doesn't
extend
to
torts,
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
you
go--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
go
ahead.
you
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
you're
saying
if
in
fact,
when
you
look
at
those
allegations,
they're
about
regulations
for
handling
secret
contracts,
it's
about
a
contract,
but
if
there
were
to
be
an
allegation
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
contract
at
all,
it's
just
a
way
we
handle
retired
foreign
spies,
smiley
for
example,
or
someone
like
that.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
you
see.
then
could
they...
what
would
be
the
rules
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
a
pl--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
a
pl-110
settlee?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
you
would
say
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are...
are
you
claiming
that
your
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
is
we
will
assume
for
purposes
of
this
case...
we're
not
admitting
whether
it's
true
or
not,
but
we're
going
to
assume
we're
not
spies--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
we
win
even
if
we're
not
spies
because
we
are
essential
persons?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
my
guess
is...
well,
he's
pushed
you
and
it
sounds
like
it
to
me...
that
the
only
basis
on
which
you
could
say
you
were
an
essential
person
is
that
you're
a
spy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's...
he's
not
a
scientist.
he's
not
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
we
have
to
change
totten?
because,
look,
what
i'm
now
thinking
is,
a,
if
you're
suing
on
a
contract,
you
win
because
you're
a
spy,
if
you
win.
if
you're
suing
on
promissory
estoppel,
you
win
because
you're
a
spy,
if
you
win.
if
you're
suing
on
pl-110,
you
win
because
you're
a
spy,
and
if
you're
suing
on
due
process,
you
win
because
you're
a
spy.
so
no
matter
what,
you
can't
win
unless
you're
a
spy.
now,
they...
they
have
totten,
and
it...
it...
that
sounds
to
me
as
if
you're
there.
and
do
we
have
to
overturn
totten
for
you
to
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
perry
v.
sindermann.
is
that...
that's
the
nontenured
teacher?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
no
property
right
there,
i
don't
think.
i've
always
taught
that
as
a
ground
that
it
wasn't
compared
to
roth
where
there
was.
all
right.
so...
so...
but
there
was
a
first
amendment
interest
of
some
kind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
probably
right
if
they
have...
i
see
what
you're
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
it
will
be
worse
for
them.
i
mean,
they
say,
look,
frankly
we'd
rather
reveal
the
names
of
one
or
two
spies
than
we
would
like
to
reveal
our
procedures
for
dealing
with
the
spies
we
bring
into
the
united
states.
it
will
take
someone
who
reads
those
about
15
minutes
with
a
computer
to
locate
400
resettled
spies.
that
will
be
a
terrible
disaster.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
answer?
what
is
your
response?
