now,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
federal
government
couldn't
enforce
any
provision
of
such
an
agreement
either?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose...
suppose
somebody,
allegedly
a
former
spy,
is
alleged
to...
by
the
government
to
have
breached
the
agreement
by
writing
and
publishing
a
tell-all
book
about
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
the
government
be
without
any
recourse
if
it
was
an
alleged
espionage
agent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
you
need
to
get
to
whether
there
is...
do
you
urge
dismissal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
or
a
dismissal
on
the
merits?
it's
not
clear
to
me
at
all.
