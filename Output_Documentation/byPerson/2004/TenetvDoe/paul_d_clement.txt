mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
like
the
totten
case
almost
130
years
ago,
is
at
bottom
an
effort
by
alleged
spies
to
obtain
additional
compensation
for
services
rendered.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
espionage
arrangements
and
contracts
we're
talking
about.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
actually
points
up
the
important
differences
between
the
way
that
the
cia
deals
with
its
employees
and
the
way
that
it
deals
with
its
espionage
agents
like
respondents
are
alleged
to
be.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect
to
espionage
agents--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
believe
that's
true,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
espionage
agents
do
not
sign
prepublication
review
agreements.
they
do
not
receive
formal
security
clearances
the
way
that
an
employee
does.
and
unlike
an
employee,
they
do
not
have
access
to
a
broad
swath
of
classified
information
that
raises
attendant
counterintelligence
concerns.
and
so
if
you
think
about
the
course
of
dealing
that
the
agency
has
with
its
employees,
the
employees
are
able
to
sue
the
agency
in
court
under,
for
example,
title
vii,
and
the
agency
can
turn
around
and
sue
their
employees
to
enforce
things
like
the
prepublication
review
agreement
that
was
issue...
at
issue
in
this
court's
snepp
decision.
so
in
the
employment
context,
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
say
that
there's
an
implied
term
of
the
employment
contract
that
either
side
will
not
have
judicial
recourse.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
individual
would
be
treated
as
an
espionage
agent
if
it's
just
somebody
for
sort
of
a
one-off
assignment.
and
i
think
that...
that
is
illustrated
by
this
court's
decision
in
totten.
i
mean,
william
lloyd,
for
example,
was
a
u.s.
citizen.
he
agreed
with
president
lincoln
to
engage
in
espionage
activities
in
the
south.
and
this
court
held
that
when
the
estate
of...
of
mr.
lloyd
came
to
seek
compensation
from
a
court,
that
there
was
no
judicial
remedy
to
enforce
that
alleged
agreement,
and
the
remedy,
if
any,
lay
with
the
president's
contingent
fund.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy,
it's
a
difficult
question
to
answer
because
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
different
strains
underlying
the
totten
decision,
and
i
think
there
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
it's
better
understood
as
simply
a
rule
of
dismissal,
that
it's
not
really
a
pure
jurisdictional
defect.
it's
been
referred
alternatively
as
a
jurisdictional
bar
or
as
a
rule
of
dismissal,
and
of
course,
as
this
court
reminded
us
recently
in
the
kontrick
decision,
people
tend
to
use
terms
like
jurisdiction
loosely
in
these
contexts.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
general
practice
of
the
government
is
to
file
under
both.
i
believe
that's
what
happened
here.
i
think
the
fact
that
we
file
under
both
suggests
that
there
is
a
little
bit
of
confusion
about
it.
i
would
tend
to
agree
with
you
it's
better
understood
as
a
rule
of
dismissal
under
12(b)(6)
because
if
you
think
about
the
totten
decision,
there's
really
two
strains
to
the
decision.
one
is
a
recognition
that
the
claim
to
relief
necessarily
depends
on
a
fact
that
the
law
has
always
regarded
as
secret,
and
in
a
sense
that
case
simply
can't
proceed.
and
that's
very
analogous
to
this
court's
holding
in
weinberger
against
catholic
action.
there's
a
second
strain
to
the
case,
though,
and
that
is
that
the
very
idea
of
walking
into
court
and
filing
the
action
is
inconsistent
with
an
implied
term
of
the
contract
or,
indeed,
the
whole
nature
of
the
espionage
relationship.
and
i
think
particularly
if
you
emphasize
that
second
strain
of
the
totten
decision,
i
think
it's
better
understood
as
a
12(b)(6)
dismissal
because
what
you're
really
saying
is
somebody
is
walking
into
court
and
they
are
effectively
pleading
themselves
out
of
court
because
as...
if
you
look
at
this
complaint
here,
it
starts
out
with
a
recitation
of
the
fact
that
these
individuals
allegedly
engaged
in
espionage
activities
and
that
they
were
denied
certain
promises
that
were
made
to
them
after
they
carried
out,
quote,
their
end
of
the
bargain.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i...
i
mean,
i...
you
know,
one...
one
way
of
thinking
about
it,
but
i
think
it's
a
very
rough
analogy,
is
it's
almost
like
an
unlawful
contract.
it's
a
contract
that
the
law
just
doesn't
recognize.
and
i
think
that...
that
reflects
the
underlying
reality
of
these
cases,
which
is
there
is
something
inherent
in
an
espionage
relationship
that
when
you
enter
an
espionage
relationship,
you
understand
that
you
have
no
protected
status
under
the
law.
i
think
that
has,
with
respect,
been
clear
in
the...
not
just
in
the
totten
decision
but
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
republic.
i
mean,
ever
since
nathan
hale
agreed
to
cross
british
lines
as
a
spy,
it
was
understood
that
he
had
no
legal
recourse,
that
he
had
a
status
that
was
not
recognized
in
the
law.
and
i
think
that
is...
it
has
always
been
thus,
and
i
think
there
is
no
reason
to
revisit
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i...
i
don't
believe
that's
true,
justice
stevens,
and
what
i
would
distinguish
is
between
a
constitutional
claim
that
an...
an
agent...
an
alleged
agent
might
have
that
doesn't
depend
on
the
espionage
relationship.
as
i
would
understand
your
question,
i
mean,
it
would...
there
would
be
a...
a
substantive
due
process
claim
that
anybody
could
bring
if
the
government
tortured
them.
they
wouldn't
have
to
allege
that
i
had
a
secret
espionage
relationship
with
the
government
and
then
they
tortured
me.
that
would
be
irrelevant
to
their
claim.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
that's
not
the
position,
and...
and
i...
and
i
apologize
if
i
gave
that
impression
in
answering
justice
stevens'
hypothetical.
i
understood
to
be
the
hypothetical
that
you
had
a
government
employee
who
engaged
in
a
separate
spy
endeavor,
if
you
will,
and
then
tried
to
sue
to
collect
on
the
damages
owed
under
that...
for
that
particular
endeavor.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly.
and
as
i
indicated
to
you
earlier,
justice
stevens...
but
in
a
sense
that's
not
a
hypothetical.
that's
the
totten
decision
itself.
william
lloyd
was...
or
at
least
alleged
that
he
was
employed
by
president
lincoln
to
engage
in
those
services.
and
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
if
william
lloyd
happen
to
be
an
employee
of
the...
of
the
comptroller
of
currency
or
something,
he
could
still
sue
to
get
whatever
remedies
he
had--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
exactly
right.
no
bonus
dollars
for
being
a
spy
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
so,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
point
is
that
the
reason
that...
that
i
think
that
the
government
would
have
had
almost
no
ability
to
invoke
a
totten-type
defense
in
webster
or
in
a
title
vii
case
is
because
of
its
course
of
dealing
with
its
employees.
and
i
suppose
that
if
the
agency
completely
changed
its
course
of
dealing
with
respect
to
its
employees
or
entered
a
very
different
course
of
dealing
with
certain
select
employees,
then
a
totten
defense
might
become
available
in
those
circumstances.
but
as
i
indicated
earlier,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
overall
nature
of
the
agency's
relationship
and
rights
vis-a-vis
its
employees,
even
its
covert
ones,
that's
a
very
different
relationship
than
the
agency
has
with
respect
to
espionage
agents.
and
again,
that's
because
they
enter
contracts
with
them.
each
side
has
certain
litigation
rights,
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
bit
of
a
stretch
for
the
government
to
come
in
and
say
that
there's
an
implied
term
of
that
employment
agreement
that
forecloses
a
judicial
remedy.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
certainly
not...
i'm
not
aware
of
such
a
suit,
and
i've
been
told
by
the
agency
that
it's
impossible.
and
i
think
it
just
reflects
the
nature
of
these
agreements,
and
it
does...
it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
in
fact
we
have
abandoned
it.
we
abandoned
that
position
at
the
cert
stage.
we
made
that
clear
to
the
court
in
our
certiorari
papers,
and
we
don't
renew
any
type
of
jurisdictional
objection
at
this
stage.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
it
probably
is
jurisdictional
in
the
pure
sense
and
so
if
this
court
disagreed
with
our
view
that
there
wasn't
a
tucker
act
problem,
this
court
could
reach
that
issue
and
send
the
case
back
on
the
tucker
act
grounds.
so
maybe
i
could
explain
to
you
why
it
is
that
we
think
that
there's
not
a
tucker
act
problem,
at
least
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation.
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
on
this
was
a
little
bit
oblique,
but
as
i
understand
it,
there
were
two
parts
to
it.
first
of
all,
that
there
might
be
some
kind
of
substantive
due
process
claim
here
that
did
not
depend
on
the
contract
but
rather
somehow
stemmed
from
the
fact
that
there
was
some
endangerment
of
these
individuals
and
that
gave
rise
to
some
substantive
due
process
right.
and
even
if
that
claim,
as
the
ninth
circuit
recognized,
is
not
one
that
is
formed
on
the
contract
or
an
implied
contract,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
claim
that's
clearly
within
the
coverage
of
the
totten
doctrine
because
it
is
inherent
in
the
espionage
relationship
that
the
individual
will
be
engaged
in
a...
in
a
situation
where
they
will
be
endangered.
and
i
think
that
was
certainly
true
of
william
lloyd
in
the
totten
case.
when
he
crossed
southern
lines,
he
was
very
much
endangered,
and
that's
something
that
wasn't
lost
on
president
lincoln.
in
footnote
3
of
our
opening
brief,
we
have
a
quotation
from
president
lincoln
about
the
inherent
dangers
of
spies
crossing
lines
and
the
need
for
secrecy
to
protect
that.
so
that's
why
i
think
that
claim
is
properly
understood
as
not
being
covered
by
the
tucker
act
and
not
being
required
to
be
brought
in
the
court
of
claims,
but
nonetheless
a
claim
that
is
barred
by
the
totten
doctrine.
the
other
point
they
made
was
with
respect
to
the
specific
regulations
that
the
agency
has
internally,
and
they
suggest
that
there
might
be
a
claim
here
that
was
based
on
the
regulations
independent
of
the
contract.
but
in
order
for
that
claim
to
go
forward,
the
court
would
have
to
examine
the
unredacted
version
of
the
regulations.
and
even
if
the
court
is
right
that
there's
a
need
for
further
proceedings
on
that
question,
it
makes
no
sense
to
interpret
the
doctrine
in
a
way
that
requires
the
government
to
wait
to
assert
a
totten
defense
until
there
is
a
jurisdictional
question
cleared
up
that
actually
requires
discovery
because
i
think
what
totten
recognized
is...
is
there
is
a
need
to
dismiss
the
claim
at
the
outset
before
any
discovery
because
of
the
nature
of
the
suit.
so
for
those
two
reasons,
we
thought
that
the...
that
the
better
view
was
that
the
tucker
act
problem
was
either
not
presented
because
of
the
substantive
due
process
claim
or
not
ripe
and
that
we
would
pursue
the
totten
act.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
whatever
the
status
the
contract
question
has,
whether
it's
12(b)(1)
or
12(b)(6),
i
think
it's
a...
it's
a
threshold
issue
and
i
think
this
court
under
the
rohrgas
authority
can
reach
that
issue
at
the
outset.
and
i
think
it
would
be
particularly
perplexing
to
have
a
doctrine
that
said
that
when
we
have
a
suit
that
we
know
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
cannot
be
brought
in
any
court,
that
we
are
going
to
not
reach
that
issue
in
favor
of
trying
to
determine
first
which
court
it
properly
belongs
in,
when
that
inquiry
in
fact
will
get
us
into
the
exact
classified
information
that
we
know
at
the
outset
the
suit
should
not
involve
in
the
first
place.
and
i
think
there
is
enough
flexibility
in
this
court's
rohrgas
decision
to
allow
the
court
to
reach
that
threshold
question
first.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i...
i
think
that
follows,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
one
of
the
difficulties
with
the
constitutional
theory
that's
advanced
on
the
other
side
is
it
gives...
it
seeks
a
right
to
enforce
internal
procedural
handling
mechanisms
for
claims
that
we
know
there's
no
legitimate
expectation
for
their
enforcement
at
all.
and
it
seems
odd
that
this
would
develop
in
a
way
where
the
procedural
rights
somehow
trump
the
substantive
rights,
and
we
know
from
totten
that
there
is
no
substance
here
that
can
be
brought
forward
in
the
courts.
i
think
in
this
respect
it
is
also
important
to
recognize
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
an
agent
who's
negotiating
in
the
shadow
of
the
totten
decision
and
the
broader
understanding
that
totten
reflects
is
likely
to
seek
assurances
not
just
about
compensation
but
about
how...
how
their
claims
would
be
heard
by
the
cia
and
how
they're
going
to
get
their
compensation.
and
i
think
there's
no
particular
reason
to
think
procedural
assurances
should
be
judicially
enforceable
when
the
substantive
assurances
are
not.
now,
one
other
point
to
make
about
the
nature
of
these
agreements.
not
only
because
of
the
nature
of
these
agreements
does
the
agency
end
up
in
a
position
where
it
cannot
enforce
these
contracts
itself
through
judicial
actions,
but
it
also
ends
up
in
a
situation
where
it
may
have
to
give
up-front
payments
that
it
otherwise
wouldn't
have
to
give
and
the
like.
so
there
are
consequences
to
both
sides
of
dealing
in
this
way
with
these
espionage
relationships
as
effectively
outside
the
law.
but
again,
it
has
always
been
thus,
and
i
think
there
is
no
principle
in...
in
any
recent
development
that
requires
this
court
to
revisit
the
rule
of
totten
which,
as
i
said,
suggests
an...
it
reflects
an
understanding
that
date
backs...
dates
back
much
further.
if
i
can
make
one
other
point,
which
is
i
think
even
though
the
totten
decision
reflects
something
more
than
the
state
secrets
privilege,
because
there's
a
more
fundamental
defect
with
a
suit
that's
premised
on
an
espionage
agreement
than
just
the
fact
that
it
tends
to
compromise
secret
information,
it
is
true
that
applying
the
totten
rule
of
dismissal
does
provide
a
clear
mechanism
that
protects
confidential
information.
and
i
would
analogize
it
to
this
court's
decision
in
snepp
where
the
court
adopted
a
constructive
trust
arrangement.
the
court
adopted
that
arrangement
where...
where
an
employee
who
violated
a...
a
prepublication
review
agreement
had
to
turn
over
all
the
proceeds
to
the
government.
and...
and
the
court
adopted
that
remedy
in
favor
of
a
damages
remedy,
and
the
court
did
so
to
send
a
clear
signal
to
the
employees
that
there
is
no
incentive
whatsoever
to
violate
the
terms
of
these
agreements.
in
the
same
way,
having
a
clear
rule
of
dismissal
sends
a
clear
message
to
espionage
agents
that
there's
no
point
in
even
bothering
to
file
the
suit
in
the
first
place.
it
will
simply
be
dismissed.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
there
is
such
a
statute.
there's
a
statutory
provision
that
gives
the
authority.
it
had
been
with
the...
with
the
director
of
central
intelligence.
the
recent
intelligence
reform
act
has
transferred
it
to
the
director
of
national
intelligence.
but
it
gives
a
requirement
that
the...
that...
that
the
director
protect
sources
and
methods.
i
think
that
that...
that
statutory
provision
is
consistent
with
the
general
notion
behind
the
totten
doctrine,
but
i
don't
think
it's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
it...
it
certainly
doesn't
impose
any
kind
of
monetary
penalty.
there
are,
under
certain
circumstances,
criminal
penalties
for
the
disclosure
of
classified
information,
but
i
think
that
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it
is.
it's
protected
both
by
the
sources
and
method
provision,
and
i
think
revelation
of
a
source
could
implicate
the...
the
criminal
prohibitions
in
the
statute
as
well.
and
i
think
that
this
statute...
i
think
you
can
see
the
extent
to
which
this...
this
case
implicates
the
core
of
the
secrets
that
the
agency
has.
this
court
in
the
sims
case
described
the
sources
and
methods
protected
by
the
statute
as
the
heart
of
the
intelligence
community.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
this
case
involves
both.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
there's
a
couple
of
points
to
be
made
about
that.
one,
as
this
court
recognized
in
reynolds...
in
the
reynolds
state
secrets
context
itself,
even
the
provisions
of
going
forward,
no
matter
what
innovations
have
been
made,
the...
the
provisions
of
going
forward
and
handling
classified
information
necessarily
involve
risks
that
the
information
will
be
disclosed.
in
the
first
place,
both
totten
and
the
state
secrets
privilege
itself
are
premised
on
the
notion
that
the
information,
if
it
is
in
fact
privileged,
is
withheld
from
the
case.
it's
an
absolute
privilege.
so
the
idea
is
not
that
you
have
some
sort
of
limited
disclosure
to
the
court
personnel
and
to
the
ultimate
fact-finder
in
the
case
and
that's
somehow
all
consistent
with
the
state
secrets
privilege.
to
the
contrary.
once
a
determination
is
made
that
a
matter
is
state
secrets,
there's
no
further
disclosure
of
the
information.
you...
the
whole
premise
of
state
secrets
is
not
that
you
try
to
prevent
ultimate
disclosure
to
the
general
public.
it's
that
once
something
is
privileged,
you...
you
treat
the
matter
as
privileged
and
you
take
it
out
of
the
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
there
can
be
certain
arrangements
in
certain
civil
litigation
where
the
government
can
agree
with
a
party
to
proceed...
as
part
of
their
overall
agreement,
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
classified
information,
but
that
would
involve
a
very
different
way
of...
of
proceeding
than
the
normal
default
rules.
and
i
think
absent
some
kind
of
agreement
for
the
government
to
proceed
in
that
way,
the
default
rule
in
civil
litigation
has
always
been
that
the
privilege
is
just
that.
it's...
the
matter
is...
the
matter
is
privileged
and
it's
taken
out
of
the
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely
not,
justice
scalia,
not
in
civil
litigation.
and
that's
why
the
state
secrets
privilege
is,
i
mean,
quite
a
remarkable
doctrine
in
the
civil
side
of
the
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
only
civil.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right,
and
a
different
bargain
has
been
reached
in
the
criminal
context,
and
in
that
context
to
ameliorate
the
consequence
of
the
sometimes
difficult
choice
of
revealing
classified
information
or
proceeding,
the
congress
has
come
through
with
the
classified
information
procedures
act.
that
only
applies
in
the
criminal
side,
though.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
breyer,
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
the
first
is
i
think
the...
that
the
totten
doctrine
extends
more
broadly
than
just
the
narrow
confines
of
the
contract.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would...
i
mean,
i
would
need
a
specific
hypothetical.
i
can't
imagine
a
tort
that
by
its
nature--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--depends
on
the
relationship.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
can't
imagine
a
tort
that
depends
on
its
very
nature
on
the
relationship.
but
we're
talking
about
regulations
that,
as
i
understand
the
other
side's
allegations,
are
regulations
for
handling
secret
contracts.
so
unless
one
can
allege
that
they
were
a
party
to
a
secret
contract
or
at
least
a
secret
relationship,
there's
no
point
in
that
individual
even
being
in
a
position...
they
wouldn't
even
have
standing
to
challenge
the
regulation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
still
think
the
answer
would
be
that
there
would
be
no
relief
under
that
circumstance
because
their...
their...
still
their
claim
to
having
any
entitlement
under
those
rules
at
all
would...
i
mean,
you
know,
total
strangers
don't
have
rights
under
those
regulations.
alleged
spies
would
have
rights
under
those
regulations,
and
the
very
idea
of
walking
into
court
and
asserting
your
rights
as
an
alleged
spy
is
inconsistent
with
the
entire
relationship
and
the
contract
that
gave
rise
to
it.
i
would
also
point
you
to
the
weinberger
decision,
weinberger
against
catholic
action,
because
there
this
court
applied
totten
to
not
force
the
navy
to
produce
an
environmental
impact
statement
even
though
there
were
regulations
on
the
book...
and
the
concurring
justices
focused
on
those
regulations...
where
the
department
of
defense
said
we
do
produce
an
environmental
impact
statement
even
if
it's
classified.
so
i
think
on
the
authority
of
weinberger
as
well,
the
very
fact
that
there
are
internal
regulations
on
a
subject,
the
entire
subject
matter
of
which
is
secret,
doesn't
give
rise
to
judicially
enforceable
rights.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
just
a
few
points.
and
may
it
please
the
court,
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
as
i
think
justice
kennedy's
question
indicated,
there
was
no
waiver
of
any
due
process
argument.
if
you
look
at
those
footnotes,
the
only
thing
that's
waived
is
the
tucker
act
concern
that
we
talked
about
earlier.
second
of
all,
i
think
in
thinking
about
this
pl-110
claim,
it's
important
to
acknowledge,
as
i
think
justice
scalia
was
suggesting,
that
it
is
the
pl-110
claim
to
the
cia.
and
as
i
understand
their
argument,
it
depends
on
their
being
a
significant
difference
between
coming
into
court
and
saying
i'm
an
unacknowledged
spy
and
i'd
like
to
sue
the
cia
and
coming
into
court
and
saying
i
am
an
unacknowledged
pl-110
resettlee
with
a
claim
against
the
cia,
please
hear
my
claim.
i
would
say
there's
no
material
difference
in
terms
of
all
of
the
policies
that
undergird
the
totten
doctrine
between
those
two.
and
i
would
note
that
even
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
at
35a
and
37a
of
the
petition
appendix
that
the
respondents
would
have
to
establish
a
relationship
with
the
agency.
the
final
two
points
i
would
make
is,
first
of
all,
they
would
like
to
make
some
benefit
of
the
fact
that
they
are
suing
as
does
as
opposed
to
the
totten
case.
i
would
make
two
points
about
that.
first
of
all,
presumably
the
reason
that
william
lloyd
could
use
his
name
in
the
totten
case
is
because
it
was
a
suit
by
his
estate
and
he
was
deceased,
so
he
didn't
have
a
concern
about
retaliation.
[laughter]
i
would
also
say
that
the
difference
between
suing
under
doe
and
suing
under
your
name
just
makes
clear
that
both
sides
to
this
litigation
start
with
the
premise
that
the
fundamental
fact
of
this
litigation
turns
on
a
secret.
they
don't
want
their
name
revealed
any
more
than
we
want
the
name
revealed,
and
that
just
underscores
how
this
is
all
about
a
secret,
just
as
in
totten.
the
last
point
i
would
make
is
they
asked
you
to
take
their
pleadings
as
a
given
at
this
stage
in
the
litigation,
and
i
would
ask
you
to
look
at
those
pleadings.
the
complaint
is
replete
with
references
to
the
espionage
relationship,
and
the
complaint
itself
cites
totten
or
the
totten
doctrine
no
less
than
seven
times.
i
would
suggest
that
if
this
claim
is
not
totten-barred,
then
no
claim
is.
with
that,
i'd
ask
the
court
below
be
reversed.
