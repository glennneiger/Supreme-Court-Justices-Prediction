we'll
now
hear
argument
in
the
case
of
tenet
against
john
doe.
mr.
clement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
the
employment
contract
is
with
an
american
citizen
to
act
as
an
espionage
agent
and
nobody
else
knew
about
it.
would...
would
that...
would
he
be
treated
as
an
espionage
agent
or
as
an
employee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does...
does
that
mean...
the
no
legal
recourse
at
all
mean
that
you
could
torture
an
agent
if
you
were
dissatisfied
with
his
work
performance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
my...
my
hypothetical
was
an
individual
who's
not
a
government
employee
but
is
hired
by
the
government
to
engage
in
espionage
activities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
just
wanted
to
ask
one.
i
don't
remember
whether
the
briefs
discuss
it
or
not,
but
is
there
a
statute
that
prohibits
the
disclosure
of
secret
agents
like
this
and
does
that...
if
so,
does
that
have
any
relevance
to
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
the
statute
impose
a
penalty
on
anyone
for
revealing
the
name
of
a
secret
agent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
the
identity
of
an
agent
a...
a
type
of
classified
information
protected
by
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
burman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
your
strongest
case?
i
don't
think
matthews
addresses
it.
what
is
your
strongest
case
for
the
notion
that
you
have
a
property
interest
even
though
you
don't
have
a
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
ask
you
what
is
probably
a
stupid
question?
why
isn't
the
contract
barred
by
the
statute
of
frauds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--excuse
me.
do
you
agree
your
due
process
argument
does
depend
on
having
either
a
property
interest
or
a
liberty
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
burman.
mr.
clement,
you
have
about
4
and
a
half
minutes
if
you
need
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
an
opinion
to
announce
it
was
authored
by
the
chief
justice.
the
case
is
tenet
against
doe.
respondent
husband
and
wife
claimed
to
spied
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
during
the
cold
war
and
they
alleged
that
the
cia
promised
in
return
to
provide
them
with
assistance
for
life.
asserting
that
the
cia
failed
to
carry
out
its
end
of
the
bargain
respondents
filed
suit
in
federal
court
against
the
united
states
and
the
director
of
the
cia
seeking
to
require
the
cia
to
give
them
assistance
and
to
provide
an
internal
review
process
that
accords
with
a
due
process.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
their
claims
based
on
due
process
and
the
estoppel
theories
could
proceed
to
trial.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
more
than
a
century
ago
in
totten
against
the
united
states
we
held
that
the
executor
of
a
self-styled
civil
war
spy
could
not
sue
the
united
states
to
enforce
his
obligations
under
a
secret
espionage
agreement.
we
held
that
the
very
essence
of
such
an
agreement
was
such
that
it
was
secret
and
had
to
remain
so.
we
thought
it
entirely
incompatible
with
the
secret
nature
of
such
a
contract
that
a
former
spy
could
bring
suit
to
enforcer.
totten
plainly
bars
respondents'
suit.
totten
did
not
merely
prohibit
breach
of
contract
claims
brought
by
former
spies
to
enforce
secret
contracts.
leaving
open
the
possibility
for
individuals
to
bring
claims
under
alternative
theories
such
as
estoppel
or
due
process,
totten
more
sweepingly
forbid
the
maintenance
of
any
claim
such
as
respondents'
where
success
depends
upon
the
existence
of
their
secret
espionage
relationship
with
the
government.
the
court
of
appeals
also
was
wrong
to
hold
that
totten
has
been
recast
simply
as
an
expression
of
the
evidentiary
states
secret
privilege
rather
than
a
categorical
bar
to
respondents'
claims.
although
we
have
looked
the
totten
in
developing
that
privilege,
none
of
our
cases
has
signaled
to
retreat
from
totten's
holding
that
lawsuit
premise
on
alleged
espionage
agreement
are
all
together
forbidden.
today
we
adhere
to
totten,
the
states
secrets
privilege
in
the
more
frequent
use
of
in
camera
judicial
proceeding
simply
cannot
provide
the
absolute
protection
we
found
necessary
in
enunciating
the
totten
rule.
the
possibility
that
an
espionage
relationship
maybe
revealed
if
a
suit
proceeds
is
unacceptable
and
requiring
the
government
to
invoke
the
privilege
on
a
case
by
case
basis
risks
the
perception
that
is
confirming
or
denying
relationships
with
individual
plaintiffs.
enforcing
the
government
to
litigate
these
claims
could
expose
the
government
to
lawsuits
brought
just
to
induce
the
cia
to
settle
the
case
in
order
to
avoid
revealing
classified
information.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
the
opinion
of
the
court
authored
by
the
chief
justice
is
unanimous.
i
have
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
join;
justice
scalia
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
