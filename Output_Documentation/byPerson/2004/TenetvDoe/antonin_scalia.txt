justice
antonin
scalia
could
i...
could
i
bring
your
back
to
your...
your
earlier
discussion
of
a
spy
who
is
also
a...
a
government
employee?
are
you
telling
me
that
he...
he
cannot
sue
for
his
regular
salary
simply
because
the
work
he
was
doing
was...
was
espionage?
i
mean,
he's...
he's
a
gs-whatever,
gs-16,
and
the
government
just
doesn't
send
him
his
monthly
check.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
no
recourse
for
that
check
just
because
he's
been
doing
spy
work?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
not...
not
for
his
regular
gs
salary.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
couldn't
get
the
5,000
bonus
for
being
a
spy.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
the
government
can't
enforce...
cannot
enforce
these
contracts
either.
right?
i
mean,
you
take
the
good
with
the...
the
bad
with
the
good?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
never
sued
a
spy
to...
who
hasn't
carried
out
his
mission?
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
would
make
a
lot
of
sense
if
you
really
felt
that
what
totten
is
is...
is
a
dismissal
on
the
merits,
just
saying
there's...
there's
no
contractual
claim.
i...
i
mean,
if
you
didn't
believe
that,
if...
if
you
believed
that
what
totten
says
is
we
have
no
jurisdiction,
then
we'd
have
no
problem
and
we
could
resolve
all
of
the
questions.
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you
believe
that
totten
is
based
mainly...
you
know,
it's
a
contract
case
and
said
the
contract
is
just
totally
invalid,
we
shouldn't
be
reaching
the
contract
issue.
we
should
simply
say
that
if...
if
we
agree
with
you,
that
there's
no
substantive
due
process
claim
here
and...
and
no
claim
based
on
the
regulations.
how
do
we
get
the
authority
to
decide
the...
the
contract
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement,
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--go
ahead.
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the...
the
argument
made
by
the
other
side,
which
seems
to
me
has
some
plausibility
to
it,
is
that
totten
was
decided
in
an
age
when
courts
were
not
as
flexible
as
they
are
today.
we...
we
have
procedures
for
matters
being
kept
confidential
by
courts.
we...
we
allow
hearings
that
are
closed
in
matters
that
never
would
have
been
done
before.
and
since,
the
argument
goes,
the...
the
only
purpose
of
totten
was
to
preserve
the
secrets,
why
can't
we
preserve
the
secrets
that
way?
if
and
when
it
turns
out
that
the
prosecution
of
this...
of
this
suit
would
require
a
secret
to
be
disclosed,
we
will
terminate
it
or...
but...
but
up
until
then,
why...
why
decide
in
advance?
why
not
take
a...
take
a
run
at
it
and
see?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
lose.
i
mean,
if...
if
that
matter
is
necessary
for
your
case,
don't...
don't
you
lose?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
civil
only.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
thinking
of
gray
mail.
certainly
in
the
criminal...
criminal
area,
that
isn't
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
either
cough
it
up
or
you
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
have
to
prove
that
they
were
spies,
but
you
have
to
prove
that...
that
they
had
a
contractual
relationship
with
the
united
states.
and
the
only
contractual
relationship
you're
asserting
is
the
relationship
of
a
spy.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now,
wait.
what...
what
is
the
basis
on
which
you
assert
these
regulations
are
applicable
to
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
your
client?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
the
agency
comes
in
and
says,
prove
that
you're
a
pl-110
resettlee.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
response
is
i
was
resettled
because
i
was
a
spy.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
question
comes
up,
you're
going
to
have
to
disclose
the
identity.
i
mean,
if...
if
it
is
controverted
whether
indeed
you're...
you're
a
spy
or
not,
then
what
do
you
do?
do
you
say,
well,
we'll...
we'll
do
it
in
camera?
that's
right?
i
mean,
you...
you
think
that...
that
a
united
states
district
court
has
all
of
these
security
facilities
available
as
langley?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--trust
me,
it
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
these
regulations
just
set
forth
a
procedure
or
do
they
set
forth
some
substantive
entitlement?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
court
would
say
you
don't
have
a
cause
of
action
unless
it
knows
what...
what
these
regulations
say.
surely
the
regulations
have
to
be
disclosed
to
the
court
at
least.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
all
of
these
what
you
call
110
resettlees...
are
they
all
cia
resettlees?
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
them
state
department
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
just
wondering
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
just
wondering
what's,
you
know,
some
foreign...
i
don't
know
who...
who
the
does
spied
on,
but
let's
assume...
you
say
they're
in
danger.
somebody
may
be
interested
in...
in
the
subject.
what
kind
of
security
provisions
do
you
have
in
your
law
office
that
would...
that
would
make
them
immune
from
the
kind
of
intrusion
that
foreign
espionage
services--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
talking
about
the
agency.
just
about
the
name
of
your
clients.
i
think
it's...
there
are
countries
interested
in...
in,
you
know,
who
was
spying
on
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
may
lead...
it
may
lead
to
other
agents
and...
and
one
of
the
problems
about
allowing
suits
like
this
is
that
this
information
about
who
the
agents
are
will
be
brought
to
a
lawyer,
kept
in
his
law
office,
and
much
more
readily
accessible
to...
to
foreign
powers
than...
than
it
would
be
at
langley.
