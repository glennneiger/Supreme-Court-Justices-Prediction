mr.
david
j.
burman
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
with
respect
to
the
question
about
the
due
process
rights
below,
i
would
note
that
the
government
does
not
challenge,
and
specifically
said
so
in
footnote
2
of
the
petition
for
cert
and
footnote
1
in
their
brief
on
the
merits,
whether
there
is
a
due
process
claim
here.
i
would
encourage
you...
and
i
will
come
back
to
the
due
process
question
if
you're
interested.
i'd
encourage
you
to
look
at
the
respondents'
appendix,
pages
72
to
74,
where
the
cia
employee
described
the
fact
that
there
are,
in
fact,
regulations
that
are
not
limited
to
enforcing
a
secret
contract.
that
is
not
our
claim.
mr.
david
j.
burman
actually
we
don't
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
believe
that--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--we
allege
that
they
were
coerced
into
that
relationship,
but
we
do--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--correct.
mr.
david
j.
burman
we
do
not
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
burman
we
believe
that
pl-110
allowed
the
admission
of
people
essential
to
the
united
states
without
any
comment
on
whether
they
had
formerly
been
spies
and
that
these
regulations
do
not
require
us
to
prove
as
an
essential
element
even
to
the
cia,
much
less
to
the
district
court--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--that
they
were
spies
for
the
cia.
mr.
david
j.
burman
we
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
burman
we
do
not
believe...
and
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
went
out
of
its
way
to
make
very
clear
to
the
district
court
that
if
we
try
to
plead
around
and
base
a
claim
on
a
contract,
the
district
court
should
dismiss
that.
mr.
david
j.
burman
we--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--we
say
that
the...
we
believe
we
can
show,
once
we
are
allowed
to
proceed...
and
it's
premature
at
this
time
to
decide
whether
we'll
be
successful
in
this
or
not.
we
believe
we
can
show
that
the
cia
has
internal
regulations
that
say
as
to
pl-110
resettlees,
we
will
provide
continued
financial
and
security
support
in
these
circumstances,
a
need-based
standard.
mr.
david
j.
burman
the
agency--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--the
agency
has
never--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--no.
we
don't
have
to
say
that.
we
can
say
we
were
resettled
under
pl-110,
which
they
have
to
inform
at
the
time
the
ins
commissioner
that
they
were
bringing
in
people
as
pl-110
resettlees.
they're
not
required
to
tell
the
ins
commissioner
that
they
were
spies,
just
that
they're
essential.
mr.
david
j.
burman
if
that
were
an
essential
element
of
our
claim,
which
we
believe
it
is
not--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--hence
the
reason
we
brought
the
case
as
does.
a
procedure
that
was
not
known
for
that
purpose
at
the
time
of
totten,
that
their
own
information
officer
and
their
brief
and
their
position
in
webster
admits
preserves
the
identity,
preserves
the
secret.
they
acknowledge--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--the
advantage
of
the
reynolds
procedure
is
if
they
had
made
the
claim
of
privilege,
we
would
know
what
they
were
claiming
was
privileged.
mr.
david
j.
burman
we
respond
by
saying
we
have
an
entitlement
to
a
fair
process
within
the
agency,
a
confidential
process--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--if
their
position
is
that
they
can't
confirm
or
deny
to
the
district
court
whether
we
were
spies--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--we
are
not
going
to
say
we
were
not
spies.
we
are
going
to--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--because
we
are
not
claiming
the
benefit
of
a
bargain
to
be
a
spy.
we
are
not
seeking
compensation--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--a
pl-110
resettlee
allowed
the
cia
and
the
fbi
to
bring
in
up
to
100
people
per
year
that
were
deemed
essential
to
the
u.s.
they
could
have
been
simply
very
important
scientists
who
wished
to
defect.
mr.
david
j.
burman
they
could
have
been
any--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--we
believe--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--if
we
had
made
the
totten
mistake
of
suing
in
our
own
name,
we
would
be
out
of
court,
but
we
have
sued
as
does
and
we
have
said
we
are
satisfied
with
the
cia
concluding
internally
whether
we
are
entitled
to
pl-110
status.
mr.
david
j.
burman
we
don't--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--since
they
have
not
contested
our
pl-110
status
until
a
somewhat
desperate
comment
in
the
reply
brief,
we
have
never
had
to
face
this
question
because
there
has
been
no
question
that
we
are
pl-110
resettlees,
and
that
as
long
as
we
do
not
disclose
our
identity,
which
we've
been
careful
not
to
do,
unlike
totten,
there
is
no
state
secret
that
is...
is
at
risk.
mr.
david
j.
burman
we--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--we
do
not
believe
that
we
have
to
have...
that
we
have
to
disclose
anything
to
the
district
court
to
have
standing
as
does
to
seek
a
fair
procedure
within
the
cia.
at
the
time
of
totten,
the
idea
of
having
a
doe
being
able
to
sue
was
not
recognized
for
a
plaintiff
who
wanted
to
protect
his
identity.
we
have
that
now
as
of
the
last--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--i
do
not
believe
so,
but
you
should
not
expand
totten
in
the
dramatic
way
the
government
asks.
and
it
does
not
counsel
for
you
to
expand
totten
when
they
cannot
define
a
clear
line
as
to
where
this
jurisdictional,
which
they
use
in
the
brief
but
abandon
here...
they
cannot
explain
to
you
why
in
webster...
they
argued
on
pages
37
to
40
of
their
brief
for
exactly
the
same
interpretation
of
totten
that
they
are
arguing
now.
they
specifically
said
that
it
should
not
be
up
to
the
courts
to
look
behind
the
scene
of
the
privilege
in
reynolds,
and
yet
the
court
rejected
that
position.
in
hamdi,
they
said
there
cannot
be
a
secret
proceeding
with
due
process
and
the
courts
cannot
review
whether
we've
made
that
available,
and
the
court
rejected
that.
things
have
changed
since
the
time
of
totten.
that
does
not
require
overruling
totten,
but
it
certainly
does
not
counsel
expanding
totten
in
the
dramatic
way
that
the
executive
asserts,
a
way
that
basically
says
to
the
court
you
have
absolutely
no
role
in
determining
whether
our
assertion
that
the
state
secret
is
an
essential
element
here
is
in
fact
the
case
and
whether
it
truly
is
a
state
secret.
we...
if
there's
anything
we
ought
to
be
able
to
decide
it's
what
our
case
is
about.
we
may
have
loosely
used
bargain
in
the
complaint,
but
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
have
now
made
it
very
clear
that
we
cannot
have
a
contract
claim,
we
cannot
have
a
due
process,
whether
substantive
or
procedural,
based
upon
a
contract,
we
cannot
have
a
promissory
estoppel
claim.
the
ninth
circuit
has
decided
all
of
that
against
us.
what
we
still
have,
though,
is
a
claim
to
a
fair,
internal
agency
procedure.
mr.
david
j.
burman
that's
what
we
haven't
yet
had
the
opportunity
to
prove
as
to
what
it
is
in
these
regulations.
but
if
you
would
look
at...
again,
at
the
respondents'
appendix
72
to
74,
the
agency's
witness
that
they
voluntarily
made
available,
did
not
make
any
assertion
of
privilege,
did
not
make
any
assertion
that
this
was
confidential
asked,
are
there
agency
regulations
that
you
know
of
that
relate
to
the
resettlement
of
these
pl-110
people
who
are
resettlees
from
foreign
countries?
yes.
are
there
regulations
that
deal
with
the
determination
of
the
level
and
extent
of
benefits
to
be
given
resettlees?
and
are
there
agency
regulations
that
deal
with
grievances
by
resettlees?
we
think
no
minimal
due
process
allows
them
to
tell
us
the
wrong
standard
and
not
to
give
us
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
a
confidential
proceeding--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--well,
certainly
matthews
v.
eldridge.
mr.
david
j.
burman
we
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
we...
we
don't
know
for
sure
until
we
are
entitled
to
litigate
the
regulation.
mr.
david
j.
burman
well,
there
has
been
no
summary
judgment--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--at...
at
the
dismissal
stage,
our
pleadings
have
to
be
accepted
as
true,
and
we
believe
that
the
pleadings
sufficiently
assert
that
there
are
regulations
there
that
create
a...
a
property
interest
and
that--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--yes.
mr.
david
j.
burman
we
do
not
believe
there
is
a
contract
and
we
do
not
believe
we
have
to
rely
on
it.
we
were...
the
does
were
coerced
into
what
they
did.
they
do
not
seek
compensation.
mr.
david
j.
burman
probably
perry
v.
sindermann
in
the
sense
that
there...
it
was
clear
that
the
contract
was
over
but
the
court
indicated
that--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--it
was
a
nonrenewal.
mr.
david
j.
burman
the...
what
the
court
actually,
i
believe,
focused
on
there
and
in
goldberg
v.
kelly
was
the
question
of
whether
there
were
regulations--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--we
believe
this
is
in
a
sense
the
equivalent
of
a
welfare
benefit.
mr.
david
j.
burman
yes.
mr.
david
j.
burman
and
i
believe
the
court
indicated
that
it
would
be
possible
if
there
were
practices
and
policies
that
had
been
established
that
set
substantive
standards
for
continuing
that
there
would
be
a
property
right
in
a
fair
procedure
for
determining
that
internally
at
the
school.
mr.
david
j.
burman
we
also
believe
there
is
a
liberty
interest.
these
people
came
to
the
u.s.
in
danger.
the
mere
fact
of
labeling
them
essential
to
the
united
states
and
bringing
them
in
in
the
pl-110
status,
taking
away
their
identity,
giving
them
a
false
identity,
false
references,
changing
their
occupations,
all
of
those
things
we
believe...
we
have
an
argument...
created
a
liberty
interest
in
continuation
of
the
protection.
it's
the
special
relationship,
the
dushane-type
argument
that
the...
that
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on.
but
i
would
hasten
to
add
it
is
premature
to
determine
whether
we
win
on
the
merits,
and
the
government
is
absolutely
wrong
in
their
brief
in
suggesting
that
unless
we
can
prove
at
this
point
that
we
can
win
on
the
merits,
that
we
don't
have
standing.
we
have
standing
to
make
a
claim
for
fair
procedures.
those
procedures
may
include
confirming
internally
to
the
cia
our
identity
and
they
may
include
confirming
whether
we
satisfy
whatever
the
need-based
standard
is
that
the
cia
has
identified.
we
have
made
every
possible
effort
to
comply
with
the
covenant
that
totten
imposed
in
a
contract,
a
contract
that
we
don't
believe
we
have.
we
sued
as
does.
we
have
sought
preapproval
of
every
single
filing.
we
had...
counsel
that
learned
any
confidential
information
were
precleared
by
the
agency.
that
is
not
what
happened
in
totten.
those
are
procedures,
as
justice
scalia
has
suggested,
that
did
not...
were
not
recognized
at
the
time
of
totten
just
like
the
due
process
claim
was
not
recognized
at
the
time
of
totten.
and
it
is
a
claim
that
can
be
done
internally
to
the
cia.
mr.
david
j.
burman
we
believe
that
totten
didn't
know
to
make
a
claim
other
than
contract.
mr.
david
j.
burman
yes,
we
do.
mr.
david
j.
burman
and
if
there
were
regulations
in
the
totten
situation
that
created
some
sort
of
meaningful
standard
that
would
be
applied
by
an
internal
procedure,
which
the
record
shows
here
the
cia
has
an
internal
procedure,
not
just
regulations
setting
out
the
standard,
but
a
review
process.
we
simply
want
to
have
a
fair,
internal
procedure.
this
case
really
is
not
about
the
protection
of
state
secrets,
but
the
limits
of
the
executive
authority
to
unilaterally
assert
without
any
review
by
the
court--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--we...
we
don't
believe
the
court
would
have
a
role
in
monitoring
the
fair
procedure.
it
would
simply
determine
whether
the
procedure
that
the
cia
has
described
in
the
court
record
already
satisfied
minimum
standards
of...
of
due
process.
if
the
court
found
that
it
did
not--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--it's
possible
that
the
cia
would
assert
that
there
is
some
reason
that
it
gave
less
than
its
regulations
that
would
be
a
state
secret.
it's
hard
for
us
to
imagine
what
that
would
be,
but
in
fact
that
is
open
on
remand
for
the...
for
the
cia
to
argue
that.
mr.
david
j.
burman
they
seem
to
do
both.
they...
we
haven't,
of
course,
seen
them
in
full
yet,
but
they
set
forth
a
procedure
and
then
they
also
say
that
there
is
some
sort
of
need,
age,
indigency,
and
health-based
standard
for
continuing
the
support.
and
if
you'll
notice--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--if
that
was
an
external
process,
but
we
agree
it
should
be
internal
to
the
cia,
that
the
process
for
applying
that
standard
must
remain
internal
to
the
cia.
the
does
share
the
interest
in
protecting
their
identity
and
the
identities
of
others
like
them.
we...
we
believe
that
the
government--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--that
there's
no
external...
there...
there
will
be
no
public
knowledge
of
that
information,
that
they
can
explain
their...
they
can
apply
their
process
internally,
apply
the
need-based
process
internally,
and
that
will
not
be
litigated
in
the
courts
if
they
assert
executive...
or
state
secret
privilege
as
to
that,
and
we
assume
that
they
would
at
that
point.
but
we...
we
agree--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--we...
we
believe
that's
the
case
and
they
have
not
yet
said
that
it
would
hinder
the
state
secrets
at
all
to
disclose
them,
and
they
have
disclosed
quite
a
bit
and
said
that
the
remainder
they
are
holding
back
only
a
need-to-know
basis.
they
have
not
asserted
any
state
secret
privilege
with
the
remaining
regulations.
and
we
know,
in
fact,
from
the
letter
that
is
in
the
record
from...
between
the
cia
and
the
justice
department
in
which
the...
there
was
basically
an
understanding
that
there
would
be
regulations
like
this
in
order
to
make
sure
that
these
pl-110
resettlees
did
not
effectively
become
wards
otherwise
on...
on
the
government
and
that
the
cia
would
continue
some
responsibility
for
them.
the...
we
are
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
this
court
has
suggested
that
there
is
an
obligation
of
the
district
court
to
look
behind
the
use
of
doe
and
determine
in
a
public
manner
the
identity
of
the
person.
that...
the
government
seems
to
assume
that
they
have
some
entitlement
to
have
a
self-inflicted
harm
that
they
would
demand
that
the
identity
of
the
does
be
disclosed
publicly
and
that
they're
entitled
to
do
that.
we
do
not
believe
that
that's
a
required
part
of
the
use
of
does.
and
in
any
event,
we
think
it
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
criminal
context
where,
if
the
government
is
going
to
insist
on
moving
forward
in
some
way
that
is
an
affirmative
defense
like
that,
they
may
well
have
a
responsibility
for
not
being
able
to
defend
their
position
if
they,
at
the
same
time,
say
that
the
state
secret
privilege
applies.
but
at
this
point,
anyway,
that
has
not
been
presented
to
the
district
court.
we...
we
find
it
strange
that
the
government
so
quickly
now
says,
unlike
what
it
argued
in
webster,
that
there
is
this
type
of
contract
which
is
not
subject
to
the
jurisdictional
bar,
and
that
is
a
contract
with
their
own
employees
when
they
tell
us
that
those
same
employees
are
going
to
know
a
much
broader
swath,
as
mr.
clement
said,
of
secrets.
if
their
rationale
made
sense
as
something
that
was
so
compelling
that
the
court
should
create
a
jurisdictional
bar
for
what
the
courts
would
otherwise
have
the
capacity
and
the
competence
to
do,
you
would
think
it
would
apply
in
that
situation
as
well.
but
the
fact
is
they
lost
webster,
and
so
they
have
to
try
to
say
that
there
is
something
still
very
broad
about
totten
but
explain
away
webster,
and
they
simply
cannot
convincingly
do
that.
webster
was
the
same
argument
by
them.
reynolds
was
the
same
argument
by
them,
and
they
lost.
mr.
david
j.
burman
well,
we
haven't
thought
about
that
because
we
haven't
proceeded
on...
on
the
contract.
there
may
well...
we...
it
probably
is.
mr.
david
j.
burman
and
there...
we...
we...
but
we
do
not
proceed
on
the
contract.
the
does,
in
fact,
do
not
underestimate
the
risks
of
disclosure
of
their
identities
and
of
their
relationship
with
the
cia.
perhaps
they
put
too
much
into
the
complaint
describing
at
some
length
what
they
did,
but
the
reason
for
that,
i
suggest,
is
understandable.
it
was
subject
to
preapproval
by
the
agency.
why
not
put
the
equities
in
there
even
though
they're
not
essential
elements
of
your
claim
and
see
if
the
agency
approves
them?
the
agency
approved
them.
we
should
not
be
thrown
out
of
court
because
we
put
into
the
complaint
allegations
which
the
agency
admits
using
the
doe,
do
not
threaten
any
secrets,
and
which
are
not
part
of
the
essential
elements
of
our
claim.
mr.
david
j.
burman
it
does
not
appear
that
they
are.
mr.
david
j.
burman
at...
at
least...
my
understanding
is
at
least
the
fbi
and
perhaps
the
commissioner
of
ins
at
the
time
for...
perhaps
at
the
request
of
other
agencies.
it
appears
that
all
three
agencies
had
the
ability
to
create
this
exception
to
the
normal
immigration
procedure.
if
the
does
can
show
on
remand
that
the
cia's
regulations
are
as
they
allege
and
that
pl-110
status
generally,
which
is
what
the
cia
witness
mcnair
basically
said,
that
many
pl-110
resettlees
are
in
continued
danger
because
of
the
nature
of
which
we
brought
them
in,
regardless
of
what
they
did
before
we
decided
to
bring
them
in,
or
if
they
can
show
that
in
their
particular
situation
there
is
a...
a
special
relationship
of
danger
created,
we
believe
we
would
have
a
substantive
due
process
argument
and
a
procedural
due
process
argument.
that
is
not
today's
question.
the
government
has
agreed
that
for
purposes
of
today's
question,
it
should
be
assumed
that
we
can
make
out
a
due
process
claim.
that
claim
is--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--and
also
in
footnote
1
in
the...
in
their
brief
on
the
merits
to
this
court.
i
think
it's
on
page
7.
my
reading
of
that
is
that
they
are
not
challenging
the
due
process
analysis,
and
it
would
be
premature
to
challenge
the
due
process
analysis
at
this
time,
which
is
what
the
court
said
in
webster.
we
believe
that
our
due
process
argument
is
stronger
than
the
due
process
argument
that
was
made
in
webster,
but
the
court
in
any
event
said
that's
not
what
is...
what
is
before
us
at
this
time.
and...
and
we
believe
that
that's
the
same
situation
now.
mr.
david
j.
burman
yes.
mr.
david
j.
burman
in...
in
general,
we
have
not
been
allowed
to
take
information
outside
of
the
agency.
even
when
the
clear--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--that
was
their
decision
to
trust
us
with
that,
and
ironically
under
the
government's
theory
of
this
case,
the
does--
mr.
david
j.
burman
--and
under
the
agency's
theory
of
this
case,
there
is
nothing
that
stops
the
does
from
making
their
identities
public
because
there
is
no
enforceable
contract
that
the
agency
can
enforce.
the
agency
wants
to
keep
snepp.
it
wants
to
live
with
webster,
and
the
only
thing
it
has
left
is
to
somehow
carve
out
a
rule
that
applies
to
these
people
who
have
done
everything
they
possibly
could,
including
not
telling
me
who
they
are.
our
files
within
our
office
do
not
identify
them
in
writing,
is
my
understanding,
by
name.
i
certainly
am
not
aware
of
who
they
are.
i
know
what's
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
nothing
more
than
that.
but
certainly
the
risk
of
gray
mail,
the
risk
of
the
does...
people
in
the
does'
position
disclosing
something
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
totten
creates
some
sort
of
bar
that
applies
not
just
to
a
contract
claim
but
to
a
claim
where
there
is
no
contract,
where
it
is
not
alleged
that
it
is
based
upon
a
contract,
and
where
the
parties
have
done
everything
possible...
the
does,
the
plaintiffs,
have
done
everything
possible
to
honor
the
confidences
that
the
government
wants
to
keep.
thank
you,
your
honors.
