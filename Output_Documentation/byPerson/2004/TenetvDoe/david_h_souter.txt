justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
are
regulations
that
the...
that
depend
upon
the
existence
of
a
spy-principal
relationship--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
are
you
claiming
that
your...
your
people
are...
were
not
spies?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
however
got
there--
justice
david
h.
souter
--they...
they...
your
claim
is
that
they're
spies
and
that,
therefore,
whatever
your
procedural
claims
may
be,
whatever
your
substantive
due
process
rights
may
be,
as
i
understand
it,
depends
upon
the
assumption
of
a
spy-principal
relationship.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if...
what
if
the
government
takes
a
slightly
different
tack
and...
and
you
bring
your
essentially
pl-110
neutral
claim,
and
the
government
says,
the
only
relationship
upon
which
this
claim
can
be
based
by
these
particular
does
is
a
spy
relationship?
we
claim
privilege,
and
on
the
basis
of
that
privilege,
we...
we
claim
dismissal.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they're
not
saying
it's
an
essential
element
in
the
sense
that
only
a
spy
can
make
a
110
claim.
they're
saying
that
the
only
basis
upon
which
you
can
make
a
110
claim
is
the
spy
relationship.
you
have
no
other.
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
look,
you're
talking
about
procedural
means.
i
want
to
know
what
your
immediate
response
to
their
claim
of
privilege
is.
are
you
going
to
say
we
weren't
spies?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
are
making
the
claim
of
privilege
on
the
ground
that
the
only
basis
for
your
110
claim
is
or
can
be,
on
facts
known
to
them,
that
your
clients
were
spies.
do
you
respond
by
saying,
yes,
we
were
spies,
or
do
you
respond
by
saying,
we
weren't
spies?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
that
you
have
a
really
obnoxious
court--
[laughter]
--that
wants
a
substantive
response,
do
you
respond
by
saying
they're
right,
we're
spies,
or
they're
wrong,
we
weren't
spies?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
are
claiming
a
privilege
on
the
grounds
that
the
only
basis
for
your
claim
can
possibly
be
the
spy
relationship
based
on
facts
known
to
them.
in
order
to
defeat
that
privilege,
you've
got
at
least
to
start
by
saying,
no,
we
weren't
spies
and
we
don't
claim
to
be.
are
you
going
to
say
that
or
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
don't
know
why
you're
not
out
of
court
on
totten.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are...
you
are--
