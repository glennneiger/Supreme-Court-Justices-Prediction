justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i'd
like
your
help
on
this.
your
interpretation
of
totten...
does
it
say
that
there
is
just
no
actionable
contract,
or
does
it
say
there's
no
jurisdictions
like
political
question?
i
mean,
you
win
under
any
of
those
theories,
if
we
accept
them.
but
which
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm...
i'm
not
going
away
with
a
clear
idea
of
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
i...
do
i...
does
the
government
file
under
12(b)(1)
like
a
jurisdiction,
12(b)(6),
no
cause
of
action?
of
course,
you'd
probably
do
both,
but
i...
i
want
to
know--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
your
best
thinking
is
of
what
totten
means.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
just
means
that
there
can
be
no
contract
formed
under
these
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
there's
no
cause
of
action,
there's
nothing
to...
to
claim
on,
what's...
what's
the
closest
analogy?
is
it
like
a
promise
to
make
a
gift,
which
is
unenforceable?
is
there
kind
of
a
contract
analogy
that
we
can
use?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you're
saying
that
if
there's
no
contract,
then
there's
no
substantive
liberty
to
protect
under
the...
under
due
process
procedures.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what's
your
best
case
for
that?
what's
your
best
case
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
sounds
to
me
like
due
process
in...
in
the
air.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
we
know
enough
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
for
us
to...
to
decide
whether
the
case
can
go
forward
or
the
dismissal
stage.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
dismissal
stage.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
was
the
firing
of
a
school
teacher.
there
was--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there
was...
there
was
an
interest
in
having
your
job,
contract
property,
and
interest
in
getting
back
salary,
contract
property.
not
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
goldberg
v.
kelly,
welfare
benefits,
money.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
that
totten
would
be
decided
differently
today
because
of
the...
our
due
process
jurisprudence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
that's
not
my
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
mr.
totten
is
here
today.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
quite
sure
where
the
government
has
said
that.
you
talk
about
footnote
2.
all
it
said
was
that
they're
not
appealing
the
point
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
