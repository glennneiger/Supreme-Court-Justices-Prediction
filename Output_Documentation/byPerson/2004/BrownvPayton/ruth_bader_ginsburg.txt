what
do
we
make
of
the
chief
justice's
fear
statement,
not
once
but
twice,
in
boyde?
the
prosecutor
never
suggested
that
background
and
character
evidence
could
not
be
considered.
so
mustn't
we
take
boyde
with
that
qualification
when
we
have
a
case
where
the
prosecutor,
indeed,
suggested
that
this
information
could
not
be
taken
into
consideration
as
a
mitigating
factor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
that...
that
the
jury
misunderstood
the
judge's
instruction,
that
there
was
no
instruction.
i
mean,
the...
the
picture
that's
given
here
is
the
defense
attorney
says,
i
can
use
this
to
mitigate.
the
prosecutor
says
this
is
not
legitimate
mitigating
evidence,
and
he
said
that
several
times.
and
the
judge
said,
well,
you
could
both
argue
it,
and
the
judge
never
instructed
the
jury.
he
left
it
to
the
prosecutors
to
argue
the
law
to
the
jury
and
for
the
jury
to
make
that
legal
determination.
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
that...
that
is
surely
an
error.
now,
you
could
still
say,
well,
even
so,
it
was
harmless.
but...
but
i
don't
think...
can
there
be
any
doubt
when
the
judge
tells
the
attorneys,
you
argue
the
law
to
the
jury
and
let
the
jury
decide
what
the
law
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose...
suppose
i
were
to
take
the
view
that
it
is
a
violation
of
clearly
established
law
for
a
court
to
allow
a
prosecutor
repeatedly
to
misstate
the
law,
misinform
the
jury
about
what
the
law
is
on
a
life
or
death
question
without
correcting
that
misstatement,
without
saying
to
the
jury,
jury,
it's
not
for
the
prosecutor
to
argue
what
the
law
is.
i
tell
you
what
the
law.
if
the
judge
doesn't
do
that,
then
that
meets
any
standard
of
violating
clearly
established
law
about
which
there
should
be
no
doubt
that
when
the
prosecutor
makes
a
misstatement
on
a
life
or
death
question,
it
is
the
judge's
obligation
to
say,
jury,
he
is
wrong.
you
take
your
instruction
from
me
and
here's
my
instruction.
suppose
that's
my
view
of
this
case.
i
don't...
boyde
and
all
these
other
cases...
it
just
strikes
me
that
that's
clearly
wrong.
what
do
i
do
with
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
now
you're
getting
to
the
question
i
think
that
justice
o'connor
raised
a
few
minutes
ago
about
are
you
urging,
yes,
this
is
error,
but
it
was
harmless?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
admonition
was
sufficient?
the
court
said
something
about
evidence
and
everybody...
i
mean,
there's
no
question
what
the
prosecutor
said
isn't
evidence.
but
he
didn't
tell
them
he
has
misstated
the
law.
we're
not
talking
about
evidence
is
not
at
issue
all.
neither
side
suggests
that
it
is.
it's
a
question
is
what
is
the
law
that
governs
this
controversy,
what
is
the
law
that
the
jury
must
apply
to
make
a
life
or
death
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
said
the
judge
corrected
it,
and
i
read
this
joint
appendix.
i
could
not
find
any
correction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then...
then
it...
then
it
has
another
problem
with
it
because
then
the
judge
is
saying
that's
an
argument.
jury,
you've
heard
arguments
on
both
sides.
you
decide.
but
it
isn't
for
the
jury
to
decide
what
the
law
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
wouldn't
the
jury
conclude...
why
isn't
it
the
most
logical
conclusion
that,
gee,
the
judge
had
us
sit
here
through
eight
witnesses
and
listen
to
all
that
and
he
didn't
exclude
any
part
of
it,
so
of
course
we
must
consider
it
because
otherwise
we
wouldn't
have
been
exposed
to
all
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
prosecutor,
at
the
very
end
of
his
closing
to
the
jury,
did
seem,
even
if
grudgingly
with
it,
to
recognize
that...
that
this
evidence
was
mitigating.
i'm
looking
at
page
76
of
the
joint
appendix
at
the
top
of
the
page.
he
makes
the
statement,
the
law
is
simple.
it
says
aggravating
factors
outweigh
mitigating,
and
then
how
do
those
factors
line
up?
well,
the
facts
of
the
case
showing
the
violence,
et
cetera...
that's
on
the
aggravating
side.
and
then
against
that,
defendant
really
has
nothing
except
newborn
christianity
and
the
fact
that
he's
28
years
old.
so
that...
in
that
final
word
to
the
jury,
the
prosecutor
seems
to
be
saying,
yes,
they
have
mitigating
factors,
but
they're
insubstantial,
28
years
old
and
the
claim
that
he's
a
newborn
christian.
