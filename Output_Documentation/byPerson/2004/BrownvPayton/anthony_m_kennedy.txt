justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
we
take...
do
we
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
not
giving
a
curative
instruction
and
in
saying,
well,
this
is
a
matter
for
the
attorneys
to
argue?
you...
you
don't
argue
about
what
a
statute
means.
that's
a
question
of
law.
you
don't
argue
that.
you
can
argue
the
facts,
that
it's
mitigating
or
not
mitigating
or
that
it's
extenuating
or
not
extenuating,
which
is
i
think
how
you
can
interpret
a
lot
of
this.
but
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
trial
judge
does
make
a
mistake
when
he
says,
well,
well,
this
is
for
the...
this
is
for
them
to
argue
when
the...
the
point
of
the
objection
was
that
there
was
a
misinterpretation
of
the
instruction.
that's
a
legal
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
can
see
that
a...
a
prosecutor
could
say,
you
know,
this
isn't
factor
(k)
evidence,
as
a
way
of
saying
that
this
evidence
is
of
little
weight.
he
did
say
at...
at
one...
at
one
time,
you
have
not
heard
any
legal
evidence
of
mitigation,
and...
and
that...
that's
the
troublesome
part.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
just
on
that
point,
if
the
prosecutor
makes
a
misstatement,
doesn't
the
trial
judge
have
an
obligation
to
correct
it
if
it's
significant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
am
i
wrong?
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
the
judge
just
kind
of
watches
the
ship
sail
over
the
waterfall?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
judge
instruct
the
jury
that
you
are
to
consider
all
of
the
evidence
which
has
been
received
during
any
part
of
the
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
are
you
taking
the
position
that
as
a
matter
of
california
procedure,
the
jury
was
entitled
to
consider
matters
that...
matter
that
was
not
within
(a)
through
(k)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
the
california
courts
said
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
the
california
courts
said
that
(a)
through
(k)
are...
is
not
intended
to
be
exhaustive
at
the
pre-payton...
pardon
me.
yes.
have
they
said
that
pre-payton?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
thought
the
case
was
being
argued
to
us...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
on...
on
the
theory
that
this
was
factor
(k)
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
factor
(k)
been
supplemented
with
a
caljic
instruction
since
payton?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
do
they
still
call
it
factor
(k)
or
do
they
just
have
a
supplemental
instruction
that
follows
factor
(k)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
was
the
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
an
equal
inference
is
they
just
felt
that
it
was
entitled
to
no
weight
at
all
given
the
horrific
nature
of
this...
of
this
crime.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
have
to
show
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
might
have
come
to
an
opposite
conclusion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on...
on
that
point...
and
i...
i
recognize
it's...
it's
not
nearly
as
clean
as
the
hypothetical
you
present...
he
did
say...
this
is
the
prosecutor.
the
law
in
its
simplicity
is
that
if
the
aggravating
factors
outweigh
the
mitigating
factors,
the
sentence
should
be
death,
and
so
let's
just
line
these
up,
and
then
he
talks
about
the...
the
conversion.
so
there
were
other
parts
of
his
argument
that
indicated
by
one
interpretation
this
is
not
mitigating
under
special
(k)...
under
factor
(k).
but
here
he
does
say
that
you
line
that
up
and
you
weigh
one
against
the
other.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they...
they
always
have
to
say
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
really
weigh
this
or
is
it
just
too
tangential,
and
that's
one
way
of
saying,
well,
this
really
isn't
mitigating.
and
we
know
as
lawyers
that
it
is
mitigating
in
a
sense
that
is...
that
is
relevant
and
that
it's
there
for
the
jury
to
give
it
the
weight
that
it
chooses.
but
jurors
say,
well,
you
know,
this...
this
just
is
not
important
is
what
they're
saying.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
a
shorthand
for
saying
it
doesn't
fall
under
(k)
because
it
just
is
of
so
little
weight.
now,
that's
i
think
how
the
jury
might
have
interpreted
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
see
where
you're
going,
and
i...
i
see
that
there's
some
parallel.
the
problem
in
penry
was
that
the
jury...
the
jurors
had
to
actually
violate
their
instructions,
and
you
have
to
escalate
your
argument
a
bit
before
you
get
to
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
help
me
on
that?
i
thought
it
was
two
steps.
i
thought
the
question
is
whether
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
was
misled,
and
then
you
have
to
ask
whether
it
was
unreasonable
for
the
state
supreme
court
to
conclude
that
there
was
that
reasonable
likelihood.
or
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
can't
overturn
it
on
habeas
unless
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
this
is
brown
versus
payton.
and
in
1980,
the
respondent,
william
payton,
was
convicted
of
the
rape
and
murder
of
pamela
montgomery
and
of
the
attempted
murders
of
a
patricia
pensinger
and
her
10-year-old
son.
payton
presented
no
evidence
in
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial
and
he
was
convicted
on
all
counts.
during
the
penalty
phase,
his
only
evidence
in
mitigation
was
that
in
the
one
year
and
nine
months
he
had
spent
in
prison
since
his
arrest,
he
had
made
a
sincere
commitment
to
god,
participated
in
prison
bible
study
classes
in
the
prison
ministry,
and
had
a
calming
effect
on
other
prisoners.
to
guide
the
jury
in
determining
whether
to
impose
a
sentence
of
death
or
life
imprisonment
after
the
jury
heard
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
testimony,
the
trial
judge
gave
jury
instructions
that
follow
verbatim
the
text
of
a
california
statute.
one
of
these
was
what
was
then
known
in
california
as
the
factor
(k)
instruction.
it
was
the
last
in
a
list
of
special
instructions,
and
it
was
a
catchall
instruction.
it
directed
jurors
to
consider
any
circumstance
which
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
during
closing
argument,
the
prosecutor
offered
jurors
his
erroneous
opinion
that
factor
(k)
did
not
allow
them
to
consider
anything
that
happened
after
the
crime.
the
defense
counsel
objected.
the
court
admonished
the
jury
that
the
prosecutor’s
statements
were
only
argument
and
not
evidence.
the
trial
court
did
not,
however,
explicitly
instruct
the
jury
that
the
prosecutor’s
interpretation
was
incorrect.
the
jury
recommended
that
payton
be
sentenced
to
death
and
this
was
the
sentence
imposed.
payton
appealed
to
the
california
supreme
court.
he
argued
that
the
text
of
factor
(k)
was
ambiguous
made
more
so
in
light
of
the
prosecutor’s
argument.
the
california
supreme
court
rejected
that
claim
and
it
relied
on
our
decision
in
boyde
versus
california.
the
boyde
case
had
considered
the
constitutionality
of
the
identical
factor
(k)
instruction
and
upheld
it.
the
california
supreme
court
also
held
that
in
the
context
of
the
whole
proceding,
there
was
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
a
jury
believed
it
could
not
consider
the
mitigating
evidence.
in
an
en
banc
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
the
california
supreme
court’s
decision
was
an
objectively
unreasonable
application
of
our
precedents,
and
in
its
view,
two
things
made
payton’s
case
unlike
the
boyde
case
that
the
california
supreme
court
had
relied
on.
first,
boyde
concerned
pre-crime
not
post-crime
mitigation
evidence.
second,
unlike
in
boyde,
the
prosecutor
in
payton’s
case
misstated
the
proper
scope
of
factor
(k)
and
therefore,
they
granted
payton
habeas
relief.
in
this
case,
we
must
determine
whether
the
ninth
circuit’s
decision
exceeded
the
limits
of
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act,
referred
to
as
aedpa.
aedpa
provides
that
in
a
case
like
this,
a
federal
court
may
not
grant
habeas
relief
unless
the
state
court’s
adjudication
of
the
claim
resulted
in
a
decision
that
was
contrary
to
or
involved
in
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
we
hold
today
that
these
conditions
for
the
grant
of
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
have
not
been
met
in
payton’s
case.
we
do
not
think
that
in
light
of
boyde,
the
california
supreme
court
acted
unreasonably
in
declining
to
distinguish
between
pre-crime
and
post-crime
mitigating
evidence.
further,
the
california
supreme
court
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
prosecutor’s
argument
did
not
mislead
the
jury
about
payton’s
mitigation
evidence.
the
prosecutor’s
argument
came
after
the
defense
presented
eight
witnesses
spending
some
two
days
of
testimony.
there
was
not
a
single
objection
to
the
prosecutor
as
to
relevance.
and
for
the
jury
to
believe
that
it
could
not
consider
payton’s
mitigating
evidence,
it
would
have
had
to
believe
that
the
penalty
phase
served
no
purpose
at
all.
furthermore,
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
to
consider
all
evidence
received
during
any
part
of
the
trial.
in
this
context,
the
state
court
could
conclude,
as
it
did,
that
there
was
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
believed
payton’s
mitigation
evidence
was
beyond
its
reach
because
the
state
court’s
conclusion
was
a
reasonable
application
of
boyde
to
similar
but
not
identical
facts.
aedpa
shields
it
from
a
federal
court
review.
the
ninth
circuit
was
in
error
to
conclude
otherwise.
its
judgment
is
reversed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joins;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
join.
the
chief
justice
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
