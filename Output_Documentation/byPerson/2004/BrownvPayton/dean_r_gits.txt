mr.
dean
r.
gits
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
off,
if
i
may,
by
addressing
some
of
the
points
that
were
brought
up
just
earlier,
and
i'd
like
to
indicate
to
this
court
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
held
that
factors
(a)
through
(k)
are
the
exclusive
considerations
that
the
jury
must
encompass
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
impose
death
or
life.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
it
has.
in
1983,
2
years
after
payton's
trial,
it
was
supplemented
to
include
all
of
the
mitigating
evidence
that
this
court
has
indicated
the
jury
is
entitled
to
consider.
but
what
is
important--
mr.
dean
r.
gits
--it's
been
a
couple
of
years
since
i've
done
a
death
penalty
trial,
but
i
think
it's
still
called
factor
(k).
it's
just
supplemented
and
changed
that
way.
the
second
thing
is
that
this
court
has
indicated
some
concern
over
the
jury
question
that
was
raised
first
in...
in
the
state's
reply
argument.
and
i
need
to
put
the
court,
i
think,
in...
in
proper
context
as
to
what
occurred
in...
in
that
jury
question.
the
case
was
given
to
the
jury
at
11:55
on
the
date
of...
of
the
determination,
and
the
jury
was
told
to
select
a
foreman.
5
minutes...
they
went
into
the
deliberations
room.
5
minutes
later
they
came
out
and
went
to
lunch.
they
didn't
commence
their
deliberations
thereafter
until
1
o'clock.
at
1:10,
they
came
out
with
a...
the
question
that
is
now
before
the
court.
and
i
want
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
reasonable
to
believe
that
during
that
10-minute
span
of
time
the
jury
considered
the...
whether
or
not
factor
(k)
was
applied.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
the
question...
there
were
really
two
questions.
one...
and
i'm
paraphrasing...
is
there
any
possibility
mr.
payton
could
be
released
on
parole
if
we
give
him
life,
and
the
second
one
is
if
the
law
is
amended,
could
that
be
construed
to
be
retroactively
applicable
to
mr.
payton.
those
were
the
two
questions.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
i
think,
your
honor,
what
the
jury
articulated
is
what
this
court
has
seen
on
many
occasions,
the
jury's
concern
about
does
life
without
possibility
mean
life
without.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
they
never
went
beyond
that
at
this
point
in
time.
so
what
i'm
suggesting
to
this
court
is
that
the
short
span
that
they
had
to
write
that
question,
which
i
agree,
given
enough
time,
might
permit
an
inference
that
they
did
consider
factor
(k),
isn't
applicable
in
this
case.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
yes,
i
agree.
and
my
position
isn't
that...
that
the
short
span
of...
you
know,
assists
our
position.
our
position
is
that
this
won't
assist
this
court
in
arriving
at
a
decision
about
whether
the
jury
considered
it.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
yes.
and
boyde
teaches
that
the
way
to
do
that
is
to
look
at
the
context
of
the
entire
case
in
conjunction
with
the...
the
instruction
that
was
given
in
this
case.
and
i
want
to
start
out
that
i...
i
agree
with
the
state
that
the
first
thing
this
court
should
do
is
look
at
the
instruction
standing
alone.
and
i
want
to
indicate
that
without
reference
to
the
context
of
the
case,
the
instruction
standing
alone
does
not
support
the
inference
that
payton's
post-crime
evidence
could
be
considered.
now,
i
agree
that
in
the
context
of
the
case,
the
context
of
the
case
could
change
that
consideration.
for
instance,
if
the
court,
as
this...
some
member
of
this
court
already
indicated,
told
the
jury
that
factor
(k)
is
to
encompass
payton's
evidence,
or
even
if
the
prosecutor
may
have
said
to
the
jury
during
his
argument,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
although
it
might
not
seem
like
payton's
evidence
could
be
considered
by
you
under
factor
(k),
in
fact
it
can,
then
we
would
be
left
with
a
situation
very
similar
to
boyde
where
there
really
is
no
argument
among
counsel
as
to
whether
or
not
the
evidence
could
be
subsumed
under
(k).
and
that,
in
the
context
of
that
case,
would
permit
it.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
i...
i
would
respond
to
that
by
saying
two
things.
he
does
say
that,
but
after
he
says,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
i
want
to
address
some
of...
of
payton's
evidence.
i'm
not
suggesting
and
i'm...
and
i
don't
believe
that
it
applies
under
factor
(k).
but
then
he
went
on
to
discuss
that
evidence.
and
i
agree
he
did.
i
certainly
can't
say
he
didn't.
but...
but
the
real
issue
here
is
what
effect
likely
did
that
have
on
the
jury,
and
i...
i'm
indicating
that...
that
given
the
preliminary...
his
preliminary
part
about
it
still
doesn't
apply
but
i
will
address
it,
that
is
unlikely
to
give
the
jury
any
confidence
that
that
evidence
could
be
considered.
so
it's
not
at
all
a
concession
that
occurred
in
this
case
whatsoever.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
that
was
a
relevant
consideration
in
boyde
and
i
think
a
powerful
consideration
in
boyde
and
in
california
v.
brown.
because
of
the
context
of
this
case,
it's
not
relevant
here.
once
the
judge
permits
both
counsel...
one
counsel
to
argue
one
way
and
the
other
counsel
to
argue
the
other
way,
the
jury
is
now
being
relegated
as
the...
the
finder
of
the
law.
in
order
to
evaluate
whether
or
not
they
could
consider
that
evidence,
they
had
to
look
at
the
evidence
that
was
presented.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
well,
when
the
prosecutor
says
this
doesn't
fall
under
(k)
and
the
defense
attorney
says
it
does
fall
under
(k),
all
i'm
indicating
is
that
the
argument
that
this
would
be
viewed
as
a
charade
no
longer
has
any
effect.
it
is
now
a
preliminary
thing
that
the
court...
that
the
jury
must
look
to.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
yes,
your
honor,
they
might.
but
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
did
not
consider
that,
and...
and
that's--
mr.
dean
r.
gits
--yes.
i
don't
think
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
yes.
i...
there
is
very...
relatively
little
guidance
that
we
have
so
far
on
the
aedpa.
i
think
the...
the
cases
that
do
have
some
relevance
are
both
wiggins
v.
smith
and
taylor
v.
williams.
wiggins
v.
smith
dealt
with
the
failure
of
the
state
court
to
actually
evaluate
evidence
that
occurred
in
this
case.
the
california
supreme
court
opinion
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the...
the
court
properly
conducted
itself
has
one
sentence,
and
the
sentence
says...
and
i'm
paraphrasing...
something
to
the
effect
of
the
fact
that
the
court
refused
to
adorn
factor
(k)
is
not
in
itself
a...
an
error.
well,
we
all,
i
think,
would...
would
concur
that
that's
true,
but
that
doesn't
address
what
happened
here.
it's
a
complete
failure
to
address
an
all-encompassing
event
that
happened,
something
close...
and
i
have
to
be
careful
here...
something
close
to
structural
error
where
the
judge
gives
over
the
obligation
to
decide
what
the
law
is
to
the
jury.
the
california
supreme
court
not
once
ever
considered
that,
and
there
is
no
reference
to
them
doing
anything
other
than
making
that
one--
mr.
dean
r.
gits
--yes.
considered
i
agree.
they
certainly
considered
the
evidence,
but
they
also,
if
they
were
following
their
obligation
under
the
law,
they
considered
whether
or
not
they
were
entitled
to
give
that
any
weight
under
factor
(k).
that
was
the
primary
function
that
was
given
to
them.
so
certainly
they
discussed
the
evidence,
but
then
did
they
arrive...
did
they
go
in
that
room
and
arrive
at
a
decision
that
maybe
we
can't
by
law
consider
this
evidence?
and
i
think
that's
the
focal
point
here
and
that's
the
thing
this
court
doesn't
know
what
happened
in
that
jury
room.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
the
more
evidence
they
hear,
the
more
likely
it
is
i
think
that
human
beings
are
going
to
consider
the
evidence.
the
evidence...
the...
the
penalty
evidence
took
place
over
a
2-day
period
of
time,
but
i
want
to
indicate
that
it
took
place
over
two
half-day
periods
of
time,
and
that
if
you
put
the
time
together,
i
think
it
comes
to
around
70
pages,
which
should
be
substantially
less
than
a
half-day
altogether.
now,
it
encompassed
eight
witnesses,
and
there
was
a
lot
of
evidence
brought
out
about
post-crime
conduct.
but
it...
it
wasn't
a
massive
amount
such
as
there
was
in
boyde,
400
pages
and
weeks
of
testimony.
so
i
think
that
that's
a...
a...
an
important
consideration
too.
the...
the
court's
concern
about
whether
or
not
the
jury
would
likely
consider
that,
it
seems
to
me,
starts
with
the...
an
examination
of...
of
factor
(k)
itself.
and...
and
i
want
to
indicate
that
mr.
payton
really
didn't
start
out
at
the
same
mark
as...
as
the
state
did
in
its
case.
the
language
of
factor
(k)
just
doesn't
on
its
face
appear
to
permit
consideration
of
that
evidence.
and...
and
so,
therefore,
something
had
to
have
happened
in
the
trial,
we
assert,
to
change
that,
to
make
the
ambiguous,
at
least
as
applied
to
payton,
evidence
of
factor
(k)
applicable
so
that
the
jury
would
reasonably
likely
consider
it.
the
events
that
could
have
happened
during
the
context
of
that
trial
didn't
happen.
in
fact,
everything
happened
against
the
defendant.
he
starts
off
with
an
instruction
that's
against
him
that
supports,
under
any
natural
reading,
the
prosecutor's
language,
and
then
he's
buttressed
with
a
prosecutor
that
given
the
plain
and
natural
meaning
of
the
language,
is
going
to
have
a
far
more
compelling
position
with
the
jury
about
whether
or
not
it
could
be
considered.
and
the...
and
the
defense
attorney's
position
is
really
nothing
more
than
an
assertion,
when
he
looks
at
the
language
itself...
an
assertion
that
it
was
awkwardly
worded.
now...
now,
the
defense
attorney
made
reference
to
if
this
was
the
kind
of
evidence...
if
i
was
a
juror
and
i
was
considering
this,
i
would
think
this
would
be
important
evidence.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
of
course,
it
is
important
evidence,
but
that's
not
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
could
be
considered
under
(k).
he
gives...
he,
the
defense
attorney,
gives
his
position
that...
that
(k)
was
meant
to
be
a
catchall
factor
and
it
was
meant
to
consume
and
take
into
effect
payton's
evidence,
but
he
had
nothing
to
support
that.
he
had
no
legal
position
to
support
it.
he
was
faced
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
that
didn't
permit
him
to
do
that.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
it
is
any
other
circumstance
which
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
well,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
this
court
in...
in
skipper...
some
justices
in...
in
that
decision
indicated
that...
well,
in
fact,
the
majority
indicated
that
the
post-crime
evidence
of
rehabilitation
in
prison
is,
in
fact,
not
anything
that
relates
to
culpability.
factor
(k),
however
way
you
look
at
it...
and
i
agree
that
it's
sufficiently
ambiguous
to
where,
given
the
right
context,
the
right
events
happening
at
trial,
a
jury
would
reasonably
likely
look
at
it
as
covering
that.
but
not
under
this
case,
though,
because
there
wasn't
anything
that
happened
in
payton's
trial
which
permitted
a
reasonable
inference
that
in
fact
that
evidence
should
be
considered.
and
as
to
harmless
error,
i...
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
it...
under
the
california
statute,
which
in
effect
requires
that
if
the
aggravating
evidence
outweighs
the
mitigating
evidence,
the
jury
shall
return
a
verdict
of
death,
if
there's
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
considered
factor
(k),
then
in
effect
bill
payton
was
left
without
any
mitigating
evidence
to
be
considered
by
the
jury
at
all.
and
that
means
that
the
jury
had
to
come
back
with
a
verdict
of
death.
now,
that
brings
this
court,
once
the
court...
if
the
court
becomes
satisfied
as
to
constitutional
error,
that
brings
the
court,
i
think,
very
closely
to...
to
this
case...
this
court's
case
in
penry
v.
johnson
because
there
the
jury
will
not
have
had
a
vehicle
in
order
to
give
effect
to
payton's
mitigating
evidence.
in
penry
v.
johnson,
in
fact,
in
discussing
at
least
the
eighth
amendment
issue,
this
court
never
really
even
discussed
harmless
error.
it
was
reversed
without
any
discussion.
now,
i
don't
want
to
suggest
the
court
didn't
engage
in
a
harmless
error--
mr.
dean
r.
gits
--yes,
i...
i
agree.
it's
not
exactly
identical,
but
we're
very
close
to...
to
that
point
in
penry.
beyond
that,
the
prosecutor
did
argue
vociferously
that
the
jury
should...
in
its
determination,
should
be
concerned
about
whether
or
not
bill
payton
is
going
to
stab
the
prison
guards
in
the
back,
in
effect,
argued
dangerousness,
which
was
appropriate.
but
if
the
jury...
he
also
argued
that
the
jury
couldn't
consider
evidence
which
plainly
pointed
to
his
lack
of
dangerousness,
his
good
adjustment
in
prison,
his
conversion
to
christianity.
so,
in
effect,
the
prosecutor
was
able
to
argue
its
side
and...
and
the
jury
wasn't
able,
when
you
get
to
the
harmless
error
analysis,
to
argue
its
side.
and
that's
what
makes
this,
it
seems
to
me,
a
very
strong
showing
that...
that
harmless
error...
that
the
error
in
this
case
is
not
harmless.
it
had
a
clearly
important
effect.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
well,
it's
certainly
relevant
to
bill
payton,
and...
and
i
don't
demean
the
position
of
the
court.
it's
not
relevant
in
terms
of
its
impact
as
to
future
cases.
there
are
some
cases
left
that
are
still
dealing...
out
there,
dealing
with
factor
(k).
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
we've...
we've
done
a
search
and
we
believe
there
is
about
70
cases
dealing
with
the
old,
unadorned
factor
(k),
but
of
those
70
cases,
none
of
them
from...
and
we
haven't
reviewed
all
of
them,
but
of
the
ones
we've
reviewed,
none
of
them
deal
both
with
payton's
pure
post-crime
evidence,
coupled
with
the
prosecutor's
unrelenting
position
to
the
government
that
they
cannot
consider
that
evidence.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
it
is
the
time
before
penry
v.
johnson
was
decided.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
it
is
not
the
time
before
penry
v.
lynaugh
was
decided.
and
when
i
say--
mr.
dean
r.
gits
--both
are
the
texas
case.
both
deal
with
mr.
penry.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
yes.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
yes.
and
when
i
say
it
was
not
before
that,
i'm
talking
about
on
the
date
of
the
california
supreme
court's
decision.
at
the
time
of
the
jury
determination,
this
court
only
had...
or
that
court
only
had
lockett
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
evidence
could
be...
could
be
considered.
and
the
court
made
the
decision
that
he
thought
the...
it
could
be
considered,
but
then
refused
to
make
any
adjustments
once
it
became
clear
that
both
counsel
were
going
to
argue
their
respective
positions
on
the
law.
the...
the
court
earlier
talked
about
other
instructions
as
impacting
upon
the...
the
context
of
the
case,
and
those
were
important
considerations
in
boyde,
especially
the
observation
that
the
jury
was
to
consider
any
other
evidence
presented
at
either
time
in
the
trial.
but
in
the
context
of
this
case,
your
honor,
it
means
nothing.
as
i've
indicated,
the
jury
was
required
to
ignore
any
evidence
it
heard
at
either
phase
of
the
trial
unless
it
fit
within
factors
(a)
through
(k).
if
it
didn't
fit
within
there,
even
though
they
heard
that
evidence,
they
were
instructed
to
ignore
it.
beyond
that,
they
were
also
instructed
that
the...
that
they
were
to
consider
the
arguments
of
counsel.
now,
being
that
there
was
no
clear
instruction
to
the
jury
that
they
had
to
consider
factor
(k)
as
being
relevant
evidence,
the
jury
then
likely
put
greater
weight
on
counsel's
argument,
and
that's
why
it
becomes
important.
so
the
other
instructions,
when
you
put
them
all
together,
rather
than
putting
in
proper
context
what
did
occur
in
this
case,
in
effect
make
it
even
harder
for
bill
payton's
position
that
the
jury
should
consider
factor
(k)
to
be
relevant.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
it'll
be
up
to
this
court
to
make
a
determination
as
to
where
the
prosecutor
was
going
and
whether
or
not
this
constitutes
a
concession
that...
that
the
jury
could
consider
the
evidence.
i...
our
position
is
that
viewed
as
a
whole,
he
did
not
go
to
that.
certainly
he
permitted
the
jury,
and
he
did
address
the
issue
of
if
the
jury
does
consider
that.
he
premised
it
by
saying,
i
don't
think
this
is
relevant,
but
if...
and
i'm
paraphrasing
here.
but
if
you
think
it's
relevant,
it's
still
not
entitled
to
weight.
if
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
considered
that
evidence,
then
given
the
context
of
that
statement,
i
don't
think
the
jury
can
hardly
be
satisfied
that
the
prosecutor
in
fact
gave
in
and
agreed
that
payton's
evidence--
mr.
dean
r.
gits
--of
what
hearing,
your
honor?
mr.
dean
r.
gits
yes.
mr.
dean
r.
gits
it
is
in
the...
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
entire--
mr.
dean
r.
gits
--yes,
the
entire
penalty
evidence
and
all
argument
and
the
instructions
is
in
there.
and
that's...
unless
the
court
has
any
additional
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
thank
you.
