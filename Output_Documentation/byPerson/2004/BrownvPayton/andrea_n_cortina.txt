ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
violated
aedpa
by
reversing
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
affirming
payton's
1982
death
sentence.
the
california
supreme
court
applied
the
exact
right
case,
namely
boyde
v.
california,
in
the
very
manner
contemplated
that...
by
that
decision
when
assessing
payton's
claim
that
his
jury
misunderstood
the
court's
instructions
and,
in
particular,
factor
(k)
so
as
to
unconstitutionally
preclude
consideration
of
his
mitigating
evidence.
the
california
supreme
court's
application
of
boyde
is
precisely
the
type
of
good
faith
application
of
federal
constitutional
law
to
which
aedpa
demands
deference.
it
is
manifestly
not
objectively
unreasonable,
and
this
can
be
demonstrated
in
three
aspects
of
the
decision.
the
first
is
that
the
california
supreme
court
recognized
boyde's
specific
holding
that
factor
(k)
facially
comported
with
the
eighth
amendment.
the
second
is--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--your
honor,
boyde
has
two
specific
components
to
its
decision,
which
is,
first,
what
factor
(k)
means
standing
alone,
and
you
need
to
resolve
that
issue,
which
california
did,
in
deciding
the
impact
of
the
prosecutor's
misstatements
concerning
factor
(k).
so
that,
first,
you
start
from
the
premise,
as
the
california
supreme
court
did,
in
following
boyde,
that
factor
(k)
facially
directed
for
consideration
of
payton's
mitigating
evidence.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
your
honor,
the...
respectfully
i
disagree.
i
believe
that
the
california
supreme
court
correctly
and...
and
reasonably
determined
that
boyde's
holding
encompassed
payton's
character
mitigating...
payton's
mitigating
character
evidence
because
the
holding
in
boyde...
or
the
issue
directly
presented
by
boyde
was
whether
factor
(k)
limited
consideration
to
circumstances
related
to
the
crime
or
allowed
for
non-crime
related
mitigating
evidence
in
deciding
the
appropriate
penalty.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
no,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
you
must
assess
factor
(k)
facially
and
that's
what
boyde
did.
then
the
next
question
is
did
the
prosecutor's
misstatements
concerning
factor
(k)
mislead
the
jury
to
believe
that
they
could
no
longer
consider
payton's
mitigating
character
evidence.
and
that
would
be
the
second
component
of
boyde
which
is
a
general
test
for
assessing
the
reasonable
likelihood
a
jury
misunderstood
the
instructions
in
the
context
of
the
proceedings.
and
the
particularly
relevant
and
important
inquiry
in
this
case
is
the
california
supreme
court's
application
of
boyde's
reasonable
likelihood
test
in
the
context
of
the
proceedings.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
and
that
is
a
fact
that
was
expressly
considered
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
appropriately
applying
boyde's
general
test
for
whether
the
jury
misunderstood
the
court's
instructions
and
an
instruction
that
facially
called
for
consideration--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--yes.
there...
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
did
not
take
the
prosecutor's
statements
so
as
to
preclude
consideration
of
payton's
mitigating
evidence
because
the
prosecutor's
statements
cannot--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--because
the
prosecutor's
statements
cannot
be
construed
in
a
vacuum.
you
have
to
look,
as
boyde
required
and
as
california
did,
at
the
context
of
the
entire
proceedings.
what
we're
here...
what
the
jury
was
doing
in
payton
was
deciding
whether
payton
should
live
or
die,
the
sentencing
determination.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
why
there
is
not
a
reasonable
likelihood
the
jury
misunderstood?
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
one,
your
honor,
the
judge
admonished
the
jury
that
the
prosecutor's
statements
were
that
of
an
advocate,
and
that--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--the...
nevertheless,
the
judge's
response
relegated
the
prosecutor's
statements
as
to
his
personal
opinion
as
to
that
of
a...
some...
as...
as...
of...
of...
to
argument,
which
is
a
statement
of
an
advocate.
and
the
jury,
from
the
time
it
was
empaneled,
guilt
phase,
and
through
the
penalty
phase,
and
at
the
concluding
instructions
was
repeatedly
instructed
that
they
would
be
getting
the
instruction
on
the
law
from
the
court.
and
here--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--i
respectfully
disagree.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
no,
but
(k)
says
you
can
consider
it
under
(k).
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
your
honor,
the
california
supreme
court
reasonably
applied
boyde's
holding,
that
factor
(k)
did
call
for
consideration
of
character
evidence,
and
that's
precisely
what
payton
presented--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--yes,
your
honor,
there
is
a
harmless
error,
but
before
we
even
get
to
harmless
error,
the
fact
that
you
disagree
with
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
the
california
supreme
court
under
aedpa
is
not
sufficient.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
the
california
supreme
court's
decision--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--the
state
concedes,
and
as
the
california
supreme
court
recognized,
the
prosecutor
misstated
the
law,
but
the
jury
would
not--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
the
prosecutor
did
not
commit
misconduct.
the
prosecutor
made
a
mistake,
and
the
misconduct
analysis,
which
is
similar
to
what
boyde
contemplated
when
they
set
forth
the
general
standard
for
assessing
whether
a
jury
would
misunderstood...
misunderstand
an
instruction
is...
is
almost
the
same
when...
when
you're
analyzing
whether
the
question
is
prosecutorial
misconduct.
boyde
sets
forth
the
test
for
how
to
assess
a
misstatement
by
the
prosecutor,
and
boyde
said
that
at
the
first
instance,
a
statement
of
the
prosecutor
is
not
to
be
considered
as
having
the
same
force
as
instructions
from
the
court.
and
that
principle
was
recognized
by
the
california
supreme
court
and
reinforced--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
the...
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor
made
a
mistake.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
evidence
to
support
the
conclusion
that
the
prosecutor
committed
misconduct
in
this
case,
particularly--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--your
honor,
the...
the
state
concedes
that
the...
the
prosecutor
did
make
misstatements,
but
i
think
that
the
bulk...
as
you
pointed
out,
the
bulk
of
the
prosecutor's
argument
went
to
the
weight
to
be
attributed
to
payton's
mitigating
evidence,
and
actually
most
of
the
argument
by
the
prosecutor
indicating
that
payton's
evidence
didn't
mitigate
the
seriousness
of
his
rape
and
murder
is...
there
were
arguments
that
were
made
by
the
prosecutor
in
boyde
and
which
boyde
found
were
not
objectionable.
but
again,
the
important
scrutiny
is
that
the
california
supreme
court
evaluated
the
prosecutor's
statements
within
the
correct
analytical
framework
matrix
established
by
boyde.
they
considered
all
the
correct
principles,
the...
the
effect
of
argument
of
counsel.
they
considered
the
instructions,
and
like
boyde,
they
found
that
factor
(k)
facially
directed
the
consideration--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--well,
you
can
find
that
the
court
was
wrong
and
not
like
what
you
did...
what
the
court
did,
but
the
inquiry
is
whether
the
jury
misunderstood
the
instructions
as
a
result
of
the
court's
conduct.
and
that
requires
an
analysis
of
the
context
of
the
proceedings,
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
california
supreme
court
did.
they--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--no,
i
am
not
agreeing
that
this
was
error
at
all.
i
agree
that
the
prosecutor
made
a
misstatement
and
that
the
california
supreme
court
thoroughly
and
properly
evaluated
that
statement--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--the...
in
this
case--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--the...
i
mean,
the...
the
trial
court
did
correct
it.
it
may
not
be
the
sufficient
correction
in
this
court's
eye,
but
the
court
did
give
an
admonition
that
relegated
the
prosecutor's
statements
to
that
of
the
advocate
and
not
to
the
instructions
of
the
court.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
it's
not
what
we'd
optimally
want
the
court
to
do,
but
that's
not
the
inquiry
that's
presented
and
answered
by
boyde.
the
question
is
as
a
result
of
what
happened.
trials
are
not
error-free.
we
wish
that
they
were,
but
they're
not.
the
question
is
how
do
you
respond
to
when
a...
when
a
prosecutor
makes
a
misstatement
of
law.
and
boyde
addresses
that
question.
boyde--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--yes.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
the
court's
admonition
was
sufficient.
but
we're...
we...
we
have
to
respond
to
the
case
that's
before
you.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
right,
and
what
was--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--sorry.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
the
court's
admonition
that
the
prosecutor's
argument
was
not
evidence
but
argument
of
counsel
relegated
the
statements
of
the
prosecutor
to
that
of
an
advocate
and
did
not
take
the
prosecutor's
arguments
and
elevate
it
in
place
of
the
instructions
given--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--but
the
analysis
is
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood
the
jury
misunderstood
the
court's
instructions
so
as
to
preclude
consideration
of
payton's
mitigating
evidence,
and
that--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--yes,
your
honor,
and
actually
that's
one
of
the
inquiries
that
boyde
required,
is
that
you
look
at
the
instruction
itself,
the
other
instructions,
and
that's
an
inquiry
the
california
supreme
court
did,
in
fact,
conduct.
and
that
is,
the
jury
was
presented
with...
with
a
instruction
that
said,
you
shall
consider
all
the
evidence
unless
otherwise
instructed,
and
nothing
out
of
any
of
the
factors
(a)
through
(k)
limited
the
jury's
consideration
of
payton's
mitigating
evidence
or
precluded...
pardon
me--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--i
think
that
the
instructions
encompassed
the
jury
considering
something
not
specifically
in
(a)
through
(k)
for
purposes
of
mitigating
evidence
because
the
instructions
say,
you
shall
consider
the
evidence
presented,
and
that
was
payton's
evidence--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--that?
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
i
don't
think
that
that
issue
has
been
presented
and
decided
by
the
california
supreme
court
specifically--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--it
is
our
position
that
it...
it
does
fall
within
factor
(k)
evidence,
but
in
deciding
whether
the...
whether
payton's
jury
was
unconstitutionally
precluded
from
considering
the
evidence,
you
look
to
the...
all
the
instructions.
and
when
you
consider
the
direction
to
consider
all...
that
you
shall
consider
all
the
evidence
and
then
the
concluding
instruction--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--no.
the
written
instruction
followed
the
arguments
of
counsels.
and
what...
and
so
no,
there
was
no
instruction
after
that.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
there
was
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
they
felt
that
they
could
not
consider
payton's
evidence
under
factor
(k),
and
the
california
supreme
court--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--but
there...
but
as
analyzed
by
the
california
supreme
court,
it
is
not
reasonably
likely
that
the
jury
would
have
accepted
the
prosecutor's
first
few
misstatements.
and
as
i
was
saying,
to
do
so,
the
jury
would
have
had
to--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--however,
nothing
in
the
following
instruction
says
you
shall
not
consider
payton's
mitigating
evidence.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
he
said
that
it
didn't
fall
within
factor
(k).
however,
the...
the
jury
would...
there
is
no
reasonable
likelihood
and
the
california
supreme
court
was
not
objectively
unreasonable,
including...
in
concluding
that
the...
that
the
jury
would
have
accepted
the
prosecutor's
first
few
misstatements
and
chosen
to
disregard
payton's
mitigating
evidence
because
the
jury
just
sat
through
eight
witnesses
testifying
to
payton's
post-crime
remorse
and
rehabilitation.
they
sat
through
that
without
any
misstatements
by
the
prosecutor.
so
they
recognized
that
they
had
heard
this
evidence
and
that
it
was
relevant
and
that
it
was
subject
to
consideration.
then
they
heard
the
arguments
of
counsel
concerning
the
weight
to
be
attributed
to
payton's
mitigating
evidence.
and
although
the
prosecutor
did
make
the
misstatements,
his
statements
were
relegated
to
that
of
an
advocate.
and
to
conclude
that
the
jury
would
disregard
the
repeated
instructions
to
follow
the...
to
take
the
law
from
the
court
and
their
inevitable,
long-held
societal
beliefs
that
remorse
and
rehabilitation
are
relevant
to
making
an
appropriate
moral
reasoned
response
in
deciding
the
life
or
death
sentence
is
not
a
reasonable
conclusion.
and
we
know
that
the
fact...
in
fact,
that
the
jury
did
consider
payton's
mitigating
evidence
by
virtue
of
the
questions
that
the
juries...
the
jury
asked
the
court
during
deliberations.
the
jury
asked
whether
payton
would
be
eligible
for
parole
and
whether
any
change
in
the
law
could
retroactively
make
him
eligible
for
parole.
you
only
get
to
a
consideration
of
whether...
what
the
effect
is
of
saving
payton's
life,
under
the
california
sentencing
scheme
that
was...
existed
at
that
time,
if
you
believe
that
there's
mitigation
evidence
to
consider
because
california,
at
the
time
of
payton's
sentencing,
instructed
the
jury
that
if
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances,
you
shall
impose
death.
their...
pardon
me.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
that
might
be
one
reasonable
conclusion,
but
the
other
reasonable
conclusion--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--it's
a
reasonable
inference
to
be
made
from
the
questions
asked,
and
that's
what
you're
looking
at.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
it's
one
reasonable
inference,
and
that's
what's
the
important
inquiry,
is
that
the
trial...
the
california
supreme
court
reasonably
considered
the
relevant,
pertinent
facts
and
all
the
applicable
law
in
reaching
a
decision
that
payton's
jury
was
not
unconstitutionally
precluded
from
considering
his
mitigating
character
evidence.
and
i
think
that...
that
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
demonstrates
that
it
applied
boyde
to
the
letter
faithfully
and
methodically,
and
that
it...
it
considered
all
the
relevant
facts
and
that
its
decision
under
these
circumstances
is
manifestly
not
objectively
unreasonable.
and
that
is
the
requirement,
and
that
is
the
inquiry
that
we're
here
today
to
resolve.
the...
the
ninth
circuit
failed
to
give
the
appropriate
deference
to
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
deciding
that
the
penalty
should
be...
payton's
penalty
should
be
reversed.
and
the
ninth
circuit
instead
conflated
objectively
unreasonable
with
a
determination
that
it
personally
felt
that
there
was
constitutional
error
and
doesn't
respect
the
distinction
recognized
in
aedpa
between
a
incorrect
decision...
or
a
correct
decision,
incorrect
decision,
unreasonable
decision,
and
the
higher
threshold
of
objectively
unreasonable.
and
unless
this
court
has
any
further
questions,
justice
stevens,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
the
penalty
phase
took
about
a
day
with
eight
witnesses.
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
justice
stevens,
the
real
inquiry
is
whether
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
was
objectively
unreasonable.
it
is
not
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood.
and
payton,
like
the
ninth
circuit...
payton's
counsel--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--that
is
one
way
of
approaching
the
case,
but
i
think
under
aedpa,
what
you'd
look
at,
which
would
be
the
more
appropriate
way,
is
how
the
california
supreme
court
analyzed
the
claim
and
not
first
conduct
a
de
novo
review
about
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood.
i
don't
think
that
in
the
end
that
there's
much
difference--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--right.
that
would
be...
right.
you
would
have
to
find
that
the...
you
would
have
to
find
an
error
and
one
that
was
objectively...
and
then
the
california
supreme
court
objectively
unreasonable
in
not
finding
the
error.
this
is
true.
so
obviously
the
reasonable
likelihood
test
is
a...
is
a
relevant
inquiry,
but
it
is
not
the
inquiry.
and
i
think
that...
that
that's
what
payton's
argument
demonstrates
and
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis
demonstrates,
is
that
they
are
effectively
equating
a
decision
that
the
california
supreme
court's
conclusion
was
incorrect
with
their
personal...
in
their
subjective
opinion
with
a...
with
the
standard
that
the
decision
must
be
objectively
unreasonable.
and
in
this
case,
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
was
manifesting
not
objectively
unreasonable.
we
know...
we...
we
know
that
objectively
unreasonable
doesn't
have
a
clear
definition.
we
do
have
an
example
of
what
is
objectively
unreasonable,
and
that
was
cited
in
payton's
brief
and
that
is
a
failure
to
consider
particular
facts
or
relevant
law.
and
we
know
that
that
didn't
occur
in
this
case.
the
very
argument
and
facts
that
payton
insists
were
not
considered
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
applying
boyde...
it's
not
in
the
majority
opinion...
are
found
within
justice
kennard's
dissent.
so
we
have
no
question
that
the
california
supreme
court
identified
the
correct
case
and
the
correct
principles
within
the
case
and
considered
all
the
necessary
facts.
and
that
should
make
this
decision
subject
to
deference
under
aedpa.
this
court
last
term
provided
additional
guidance
on
how
to
assess
the
range
of
reasonable
judgment
through
the
lens
of
aedpa
in
yarborough
v.
alvarado.
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
ninth
circuit
and
payton's
analysis
keeps
overlooking
is
the...
boyde's
specific
holding
concerning
factor
(k).
and
when
you
analyze
the...
the
range
of
reasonable
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
concerning
factor
(k),
the
specific
rule
of
factor
(k),
the...
the
range
of
reasonable
judgment
was
less.
the
california
supreme
court
had
little
to
no
leeway
to
conclude
otherwise.
boyde's
holding
is
broad.
boyde
held
that
factor
(k)
was
a
broad,
catchall
mitigation
instruction
that
allowed
for
any
other
circumstance
that
counseled
a
sentence
less
than
death
and
specifically
found
that
background
and
character
fell
within
the
ambit
of
factor
(k).
and
no
decision
of
this
court
or
the
california
supreme
court
in
analyzing
character
has
ever
drawn
a
distinction
between
post-crime
and
pre-crime
character
evidence--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--the
footnote
in
boyde
actually
supports
more
california's
position
that
factor
(k)
encompasses
any
other
circumstance
that
would
counsel
a
sentence
less
than
death
as
opposed
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
payton's
interpretation
that
factor
(k)
is
limited
to
the
crime.
in
both
the
first
part
of
footnote
5,
the...
the...
chief
justice
rehnquist
rejects
the
dissent's
argument
that
the
gravity
of
the
crime
focused
the
consideration
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
rather,
it
allowed
the
jury
to
assess
the
seriousness
of
what
the
defendant
has
done
in
light
of
what's
the
appropriate
punishment,
and
that
involves
a
consideration
of
the
defendant's
background
and
character.
and
then
the
last
part
of
footnote
5
expressly
recognizes
that
factor
(k)
allows
for
consideration
of
good
character
evidence,
and
good
character
evidence
is
only
relevant
to
a
decision
about
whether
the
person
should
live
or
die,
not
to
circumstances
related
to
the
crime.
and
good
character
evidence
under
payton
and
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation
of
factor
(k)
would
not
and
could
not,
whether
it
existed
pre
or
post-crime,
fall
under
the
meaning
of
factor
(k).
so
the
footnote
5
actually
bolsters
the
ultimate
broad
interpretation
that
the
california
supreme
court
adopted
when
it
applied
boyde...
boyde's
specific
holding
concerning
factor
(k)
to
the
analysis
of
payton's
claim.
and
although
they
did,
in
footnote
5,
distinguish
the
fact
that
it
did
not
involve
post-crime
evidence
in
mitigation,
it
didn't
decide
the
question.
it
was
simply
noting
a
fact
that
distinguished
the
case
from
skipper.
and...
and
aedpa
requires
that
we
follow
the
holdings
of
the
court
and
not
dicta.
so
when
we
start--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--the
california
supreme
court's
decision
was
a
reasonable
application
of
boyde
and
the
ninth
circuit's
reversal
of
it
is...
and
this
court
should--
ms.
andrea
n.
cortina
--exactly.
thank
you.
