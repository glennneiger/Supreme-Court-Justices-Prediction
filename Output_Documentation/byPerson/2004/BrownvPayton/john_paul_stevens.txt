john
paul
stevens
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
brown
against
payton.
ms.
cortina.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
a
question
that
goes
sort
of
to
the
beginning?
what
is
your
position
on
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
correctly
stated
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
also
concede
he
did
so
deliberately?
do
you
concede
there
was
prosecutorial
misconduct
is
what
i'm
really
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that...
that
statement
went
to
whether
the
jury
was
apt
to
accept
it,
not
to
the
question
of
whether
the
prosecutor
acted
improperly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
ms.
cortina,
the...
the
red
brief...
maybe
it's
not
accurate.
they
say
the
instruction
was
all
the
evidence
received
during
any
part
of
the
trial
in
this
case,
except
as
you
may
hereafter
be
instructed,
and
then
that
followed
what...
the
factor
(k)
discussion
came
after
that.
so
would
it
not
have
been
possible
that
the
jury
would
have
thought
except
for
the
following
things?
or
is
there
something
more
that
i
missed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
they
misunderstood
the
factor
(k)
instruction,
they
would
have
thought
they
could
not
consider
all
the
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they
believed
the
prosecutor,
they
would
have
thought
they
couldn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
all...
all
i'm
directing
my
inquiry
to
is
to
the
significance
of
the
instruction
to
consider
all
the
evidence.
i
think
it's
they
could
consider
all
the
evidence,
except
that
which
may
not
be
admissible,
as
i
now...
or
may
not
be
relevant
as
i
shall
hereafter
instruct
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
prosecutor
said
that
if
you
interpret
the
last
instruction
properly,
you
shall
not
do
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
mr.
gits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
gits.
ms.
cortina,
you
have
a
little
over
5
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms....
go
ahead
and
make
one
more
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
we
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
