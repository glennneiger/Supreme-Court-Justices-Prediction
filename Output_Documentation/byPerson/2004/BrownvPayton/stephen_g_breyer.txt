justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
long
did
the
penalty
phase
take?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
those
don't
sound
as
if
they
thought
his
conversion
to
christianity
made
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
actually
that
isn't
really
the
issue.
i
think...
i
find
that
easy.
the
harder
issue
is...
is
whether
the...
a
person
who
thought
about
it
differently
than
me,
a
judge,
would
have...
be
objectively
unreasonable.
at
least
for
me,
that's
the
hard
question.
the
question
you're
arguing
is
not
hard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
would
perhaps
have
come
to
a
different
conclusion
than
california
supreme
court
on
that
question,
but
we
can
overturn
them
only
if
they're
objectively
unreasonable.
and
that's...
that's
the
hard
thing
because...
for
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no,
but
i
mean,
that's...
that's
really
wrong
what
the
judge
did.
but...
but
the...
that...
that's
tangential
to
the
question.
the
question
is,
is
it
reasonably
likely,
if
that
hadn't
occurred,
that
the
jury
would
have
considered
the
evidence
that
he
was
converted?
but
since
it
did
occur,
you
know,
they...
they
didn't
consider
it.
is
it
reasonably
likely
they
never
considered
it?
that's...
that's
the
question.
and
then
i
can
imagine,
for
what
reason
that
justice
ginsburg
said,
myself
sitting
in
the
california
supreme
court
and
saying,
well,
they
heard
the
evidence
for
2
days
or
a
day,
six
witnesses,
eight
witnesses.
they're
not
technicians,
the
jury.
and...
and
of
course,
they
considered
it.
i
can
imagine
that
and
that's
why
i'm
having...
even
though
i
don't
agree
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
it...
it
says
that...
what's...
what's
the
exact
language
of
that
statute?
i
just
had
it
here.
it's...
it's
gravity.
it's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
the
crime.
you
could
say
it.
yes,
his...
his
later
conversion
extenuated
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
not
the...
not
the...
when
i
try
to
think
of
this
person,
who
is
not
me,
thinking
of
that,
i
say,
well,
plausible.
plausible,
not
perhaps
the
best,
but
plausible,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
relevant
at
all?
this
happened
24
years
ago.
we're
sitting
here
trying
to
think
of
what
a
jury
would
have
been
thinking
in
a
state
of
the
law
that's
a
quarter
of
a
century
old
and
facts...
i
don't
know
what
to
think.
i
guess
that's
just
irrelevant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
all
this
was
at
a
time
before
penry
was
decided.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
the
texas...
the
texas...
you
know,
the
ones--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
one
and
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do...
do
we
have
a
transcript
of
that
hearing
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
penalty
phase.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--one
way...
if
i'm
having
trouble,
i'll
just
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
whole
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
footnote
in
boyde
that
seems
to
draw
that
distinction.
