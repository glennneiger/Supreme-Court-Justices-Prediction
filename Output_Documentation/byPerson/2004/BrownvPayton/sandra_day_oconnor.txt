justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
we
conclude
that
there
was
an
error
here?
is
there
a
harmless
error
argument
that
you
fall
back
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
prosecutor
had
said
several
times
to
the
jury
during
the
course
of
his
arguments
that
the
burden
of
proof
by
the
state
is
by
a
preponderance,
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
and
the
judge
just
says
the
prosecutor's
arguments
are
just
that,
they're
not
the
law.
i'll
instruct
you.
but
he
never
says
anything.
is
that
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
normally
we
would
think
the
trial
judge
would
correct
a
misstatement
of
the
law
by
counsel.
we
would
normally
think
that,
wouldn't
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
wasn't
clearly
done
here.
i
mean,
the...
the
jury
was
reminded
that
arguments
of
counsel
are
just
that.
but
there
was
no
attempt
to
correct
what
appeared
to
be
a
misstatement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
except
if
they
heard
so
much
of
the
evidence,
isn't
it
unlikely
that
the
jury
thought
they
couldn't
consider
what
they
heard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that--
