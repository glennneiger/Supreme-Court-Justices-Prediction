justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
the
holding
was
that
factor
(k),
standing
alone,
does...
does
not
raise
a...
does...
does
not,
standing
alone,
raise
a
question
of
reasonable
probability
of...
of
misunderstanding
or
misapplication
of
the
law.
and
that's
not
what
they're
claiming
here.
they're
claiming
here
that
there
was
something
much
more
than
(k)
standing
alone.
as
i
understand
it,
they're
claiming
that
the
difference
between
this
and
boyde
and
why
this
is
not
a
standalone
kind
of
case
is
that
the
prosecutor
deliberately
argued
or
argued
law
that
was
in
fact
wrong
and...
and
continued
to
do
so
even
after
the
court
interrupted
the
argument
and
that
the
court
never
gave
an
instruction
that
corrected
the
erroneous
statements
of
law
that
the
prosecutor
had
made.
so
that's...
that's
why
they're...
they're
saying
this
is
not
a
boyde
situation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
no.
the...
the
mitigating
evidence
that
boyde
held
could
be
considered
without
a...
(k)
being
a
bar,
was
mitigating
evidence
about
the...
the
character
of
the
individual
prior
to
or
at
least
up
to
the
moment
of
the
crime.
so
this
is...
this
is
different
kind
of
evidence,
and
i...
i
mean,
this
is
post-crime
evidence.
and...
and
i
don't
see
that...
that
boyde's
holding
is
so
broad
as
obviously
to
cover
this
at
all.
it
might
be
a...
it
would
be
a...
a
closer
question
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
prosecutor's
argument
and
the
judge's
failure
to
correct
it.
but
even...
even
without
those
elements,
there
would
be
a
serious
question
whether
boyde
covered
this
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
even...
even
if...
even
if
that's
argument
is...
is
on
point,
just
taking
your...
your
response
on
its
own
terms,
where
do
you
get
a
reasonable
likelihood?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
let's
get
specific.
you...
you
said
there
isn't
a
reasonable
possibility.
why?
get...
get
down
to
facts.
why
isn't
there
a
reasonable
possibility?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
the
prosecutor
stands
there
and
twice
says,
before
the
judge
interrupts
him
and
after
the
judge
interrupts
him...
says,
you
cannot
legally
consider
this
evidence.
it
does
not
fall
within
(k),
and
the
judge
never
corrects
it.
why
is
there
not
a...
a
reasonable
likelihood
of...
of
jury
mistake?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
precisely,
if
i
recall...
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
what
the
judge
said
was
that
the
prosecutor's
statements
were...
were
not
evidence.
of
course,
they're
not
evidence.
the
issue
isn't
whether
they
were
evidence.
they
were
statements
of
the
law.
the
judge
didn't
say
anything
about
whether
they
were
correct
or
incorrect
statements
of
the
law.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
judge's
response
to
the
objection
was
totally
beside
the
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
court
didn't
give
them
an
instruction
on
this
contested
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
didn't
come
out
and
say,
yes,
you
can
consider
this
under
(k).
he
never
said
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
(k)
says
you
can
consider
evidence
that...
that
goes
to
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
i
will
be
candid
to
say
i
think
you're
stretching
things
about
as
far
as
you
can
stretch,
as
boyde
held,
that...
that
character
evidence
pre
and
up
to
the
time
of
crime
can
be
considered
reasonably
under
that
factor.
but
certainly
evidence
of
what
an
individual
did
after
the
crime
is
committed
does
not
naturally
fall
within
(k)
at
all,
and
i
don't
know
why
any
juror
would
consider
it
unless
a
judge
came
out
and
said
flatly
you
can.
justice
david
h.
souter
they...
they
might
have
thought
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
were
entitled
to...
to
great
weight.
i
mean,
we
don't
know
how
they
evaluated
the
aggravating
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
mean,
that...
that
is
a
possible
conclusion,
and
therefore,
it
doesn't
follow
from
the
fact
that
they
raised
the
question
about
life
without
parole
that
they
necessarily
had
found...
that
they
were
necessarily
considering
the
mitigating
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's...
it's
one
possibility.
isn't
that
all?
