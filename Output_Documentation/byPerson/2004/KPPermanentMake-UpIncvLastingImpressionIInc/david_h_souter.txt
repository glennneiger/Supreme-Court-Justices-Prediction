but
there
is
a
sense
of
color
in
which
color
is
synonymous
with
pigment.
and
i
assume
that's
what
was
accepted
here,
which
leads
me
to
my
question,
i
don't
understand
why
we're
having
this
discussion.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
i
thought
it
was
agreed
that
for
purposes
of
the
defense,
this
was
a
descriptive
use,
is
that
incorrect?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
could
you
just
point
to
me...
i'm
not
asking
so
much
about
the
"why",
i
just
want
to
know
what
this
case
is.
is
there
someplace
in
the
materials
that
we've
got
that
indicate
that,
in
fact,
you
dispute
that
there
is
a
descriptive
use
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
saying,
isn't
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
is
that
it
was
a
rebuttable
presumption?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
simply
went
too
far
in
the
other
direction
and
required
too
much.
and
all
we
have
to
determine
is
whether
there
is
a
per
se
obligation
to
prove
non-confusion.
if
we
do
so,
that
doesn't
necessarily
reinstate
the
district
court's
position,
it
simply
says
that
the
ninth
circuit
went
too
far,
isn't
that
correct?
i
mean,
that
is
what
is...
that
is
the
issue
before
us?

this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
trademark
act
of
1946
also
known
as
the
lanham
act
requires
the
holder
of
a
registered
mark
to
show
that
another's
used
of
its
imitation
of
its
mark
is
likely
to
cause
confusion,
what
it
cause
mistake,
or
to
deceive.
in
order
to
prevail
an
infringement
action,
the
defendant
in
such
an
action
has
an
affirmative
defense
of
fair
use.
if
it
can
show
that
its
use
of
the
term
is
used
otherwise
than
as
a
mark
of
a
term
which
is
descriptive
of
and
used
fairly
and
in

the

court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
kp
on
its
fair
use
defense
the
trademark
infringement.
but
it
did
so
without
considering
whether
kp's
use
of
the
term
was
likely
to
cause
confusion
among
consumers
as
to
the
origin
of
kp's
goods.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
finding
that
kp
could
only
benefit
from
the
fair
use
defense
if
there
was
no
likelihood
of
confusion
between
its
use
of
the
term
"micro
color"
and
lasting's
mark.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
we
vacate
the
judgment
and
hold
that
the
defendant
to
an
infringement
action
has
no
need
to
show
that
confusion
is
unlikely
in
order
to
make
out
the
affirmative
defense
of
fair
use.
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
statute
setting
out
the
affirmative
defense
indicates
the
defendants
must
make
any
showing
regarding
likelihood
of
confusion,
and
because
congress
was
specific
in
requiring
the
mark
holder
to
show
likelihood
of
confusion,
mistake
or
deception.
in
order
to
make
out
an
infringement
claim,
we
decline
lasting's
invitation
to
read
congress'
silence
on
the
significance
of
confusion
under
the
fair
use
defense
in
order
to
require
the
defendant
to
show
an
absence
of
such
likelihood.
nor
can
the
common
law
of
unfair
competition
be
used
to
require
the
defendant
to
shoulder
a
burden
on
this
issue.
the
common
law
in
fact
tolerated
some
degree
of
confusion
from
a
descriptive
use
of
words
contained
in
another
person's
mark,
and
it
did
so
in
order
to
preserve
the
common
right
to
use
descriptive
terms.
finally,
it
would
make
little
sense
to
require
the
defendant
to
disprove
as
part
of
its
affirmative
defense
an
element
of
the
plaintiff's
prima
facie
case.
if
the
defendant
could
do
that
it
would
have
no
need
of
an
affirmative
defense
at
all.
it
follows
from
our
conclusion
that
some
degree
of
consumer
confusion
may
co-exist
with
the
fair
use
of
the
term
contained
in
another's
trademark.
but
our
holding
does
not
foreclose
the
possibility
that
the
extent
of
likely
consumer
confusion
maybe
relevant
in
assessing
whether
a
defendant's
use
is
objectively
fair.
we
leave
such
questions
for
another
day.
the
opinion
is
unanimous
almost.
