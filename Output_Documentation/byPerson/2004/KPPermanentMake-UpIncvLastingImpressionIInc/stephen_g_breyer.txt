justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that...
i'm...
and
i'm
mixed
up.
i
thought
that
the
issue
is
whether
you,
on
your
side,
have
to
present
evidence
of
no
confusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
as
far
as--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
as
far
as
justice
o'connor's
question
is
concerned,
i
thought
your
answer
would
be,
if
they
want
to
go
and
present
evidence
that
there
is
confusion,
to
the
point
where
it's
so
obviously
unfair,
it's
ridiculous,
they
can
do
it.
i
mean,
do
you
object
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
so
your
answer
to
her
question
is,
of
course
it
could
be
relevant.
let
the
other
side
come
in
and
show
that
it's
relevant.
you
don't
have
to
show
that
there
is
no
confusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
where
we
are,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i'm
confused.
i
thought
the
question
you're
supposed
to
answer,
which
is
in
the
blue
brief,
is
whether
they
have
to
show
an
absence
of
confusion.
and
i
guess
now
you
agree
the
answer
to
that
question
is
"no".
is
that
right,
you
agree
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
the
end
of
this
case,
isn't
it?
that's
what
we
took
it
to
decide,
and
that's...
you
agree
with
it
and
they
agree
with
it,
so
everybody's
happy.
we
don't
even
have
to
write
an
opinion,
we
can
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
suppose
you
establish
it,
maybe
we
can
find
some
differences
here,
would
you
also
agree
that
simply
establishing
confusion
is
not
enough
to
overcome
the
fair-use
defense,
you'd
have
to
also
show
that
the
confusion,
along
with
possibly
other
things
are
such
that
it
shows
unfairness,
or
what's
the
other
word,
unfairness,
or
lack
of
good
faith?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
agree
with
that,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good,
so
now
we
have
something
i
can
disagree
with
you
about.
now,
the
question
would
be,
why,
it's
the
words
are
unfair,
why,
if
you
just
show
there's
some
confusion,
which
normally
there
would
be,
or
quite
often
there
would
be,
why
is
that
enough
to
overcome
their
defense
that
they
put
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
now,
if
we're
going
to
go
back
into
what
the
court
did,
i
would
say
that
i
was
a
little
disturbed
reading
this
as
to
why
you
get
protection
at
all,
because
i
was
thinking
"micro
color",
well,
that
describes
very
well
what
it
is,
it's
a
tiny,
teeny,
weenie,
weenie
bit
of
color.
and
when
i
think
of
"micro
pigment",
i
think
of
a
farm
animal,
i
think...
i
don't
know
what
i
think,
it's
confusing
me.
so,
for
an
average
person,
the
word
"micro
color",
i
thought,
"gee,
that's
very
descriptive
of
just
what
it
is,
a
teeny
weenie
bit
of
color.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
ibm
had
used
the
word
"computers"
when
they
were
the
only
company
for
ten
or
fifteen
years
to
mark
their
product.
now,
another
company
comes
along
and
they
produce
the
same
thing,
they
want
to
use
the
word
"computer".
you're
saying
that
that
would
be
the
end
of
it,
they
couldn't
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
people
would
be
confused.
for
a
while
they'll
think
that
ibm,
there
would
be
confusion,
but
it's
the
best
word
to
describe
the
product,
in
fact,
at
least
a
very
good
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
at
the
very
beginning,
ibm
was
the
only
one
to
do
it,
they
didn't
have
to
call
it
computer,
they
could
have
called
it
a
word
processor,
they
could
have
called
it
a
"think
faster".
i
don't
know
what
they
could
have
called
it,
but
i
mean,
you
know,
they
chose
the
word
computer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
this
fair-use
defense
for,
since
you're
normally
going
to
show
confusion
to
show
the
infringement,
what's
it
for,
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
also...
it's
very
efficient
to
allow
people
to
communicate,
in
english.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
guess
that's
the
question,
because
sometimes
people...
i
have
no
doubt--
