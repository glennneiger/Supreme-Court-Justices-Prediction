may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
does
the
term
"micro
color"
describe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
have
a
meaning
in
any
context
other
than
describing
the...
one
party's
product
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
do
they
use
the
apple
as
clearly
a
descriptive
term
with
secondary
meaning,
that's
what
gives
it
protection.
but
if
you
have
an
arbitrary
term,
as
justice
scalia
says,
how
could
that
be,
how
could
the
defense
have
any
relevance
to
a
fanciful
or
arbitrary
term.
and
i
thought
the
defense
only
was
relevant
when
you...
everybody
agrees
you're
talking
about
descriptive
terms?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
may
i
just
interrupt,
but
when
would
one
ever
be
able
to
use
the
defense
if
the
plaintiff
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case,
prima
facie
case,
i
assume,
includes
the
burden
of
establishing
likelihood
of
confusion.
so,
is
there
any
room
for
the
defense
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
answer
is
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
allowed
without
the
affirmative
defense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
suggesting,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
follow
your
thinking,
are
you
saying
that
in,
back
in
those
days,
somebody
with
an
incontestable
mark
did
not
have
to
prove
likelihood
of
confusion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
otherwise,
wouldn't
that
defeat
the
defense,
too,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
customers
are
pretty
sophisticated
people,
i
guess,
they're
specialists
in
an
unusual
trade,
so
they're
not
just
like
a
person
walking
off
the
street
that
doesn't
know
what
it
is,
they
probably
know
this
market
pretty
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
out
of
curiosity,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case,
do
they
market
this
product
with
color
charts,
just
like
paint
companies
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clerk
the
clerk
will
now
undertain
motions
or
the
admission
to
the
bar
of
the
court.
