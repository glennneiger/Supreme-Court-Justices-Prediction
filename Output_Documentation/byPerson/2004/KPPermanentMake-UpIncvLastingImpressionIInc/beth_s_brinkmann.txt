ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
defendant's...
petitioner's
absolute
defense
is
contrary
to
the
text,
purpose,
structure
and
history
of
the
fair-use
defense
of
the
lanham
act.
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
this
is
the
risk
that
someone
takes
when
they
choose
a
descriptive
term,
this
defense
does
not
apply
only
to
descriptive
terms.
under
petitioner's
view,
this
defense
would
be
available
to
users
of
arbitrary,
fanciful
and
suggestive
marks
so
long
as
they
were
used
descriptively
and
not
as
a
mark.
indeed,
our
mark
here
is
not--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
it
may
mean
something
in
a
different
context,
i
think
an
example
you
could
use
would
be
the
arbitrary
trademark
of
"apple"
for
computers.
there
could
be
advertising
for
computer
electronics,
incorporated
in
the
fall,
when
there's
the
back
to
school
rush,
using
the
term
"apple"
in
a
descriptive
sense:
"apples
for
teachers",
you
know,
the
beginning
of
the
year,
"come
to
our
store".
so,
in
reliance
on
that,
you
drive
two
hours
because
you're
the
school
district
director
who
needs
to
buy
ten
new
computers
to
hook
into
the
system.
you
get
there,
it
turns
out
they're
not
apple
computers.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor,
the
solicitor
general
does
not
take
that
position
either,
in
their
brief
they
recognize
that
this
applies
to
all
level
of
mark.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
was
that
it
was
inherently
distinctive,
or
descriptive,
and
we
maintain
that
it
is
suggestive,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
this
isn't
a
word
that
can
be
found
in
the
english
language
anywhere,
it
doesn't
describe
the
pigment
or
the
ink,
what
it
does
is
suggests
the
small
nature
and
the
fine
lines
that
are
ultimately
used
when
this
is
applied.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
don't
believe
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
test
does,
this
was
a
summary
judgment
entered
against
us
when
we
had
introduced--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
we
believe
it's
the
plaintiff's
burden,
it's
clear
it's
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
show
likelihood
of
confusion.
the
point
is,
under
the
district
court's
absolute
rule,
notwithstanding
evidence
in
this
case
of
actual
confusion,
indeed,
summary
judgment
was
entered
against
us
because
the
district
court
took
petitioner's
absolute
view
that
there
was
no
relevance
whatsoever
to
likelihood
of
confusion
to
the
determination
of
fair
use,
that's
the
rule
in
the
ninth
circuit
overruled,
and
that's
what
needs
to
be
affirmed.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
believe
the
petitioner
came
up
with
that
formulation
because
they
had
taken
on
the
burden
because
they
were
the
movant
on
summary
judgment.
that's
where
that
misnomer
came
from.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
agree
that
the
plaintiff,
it's
clear
that
under...
in
the
ninth
circuit...
the
ninth
circuit
pointed
out
that,
justice
ginsburg
quoted
before,
made
clear
that
the
plaintiff
does
bear
the
burden
of
establishing
likelihood
of
confusion.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
believe
that
when
congress--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor,
we
agree
that
when
congress
wrote
the
test
in
1946,
it
used
the
terms
"used
fairly"
to
refer
to
the
common
law,
which
included
not
only
the
common
law
of
technical
trademark,
but
the
common
law
of
unfair
competition.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
the
time
that
those
words
were
used,
the
common
law,
and
we
respectfully
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general's
office
on
the
reading
of
warner,
we'd
urge
the
court
to
read
that.
the
reason
the
court
allowed
the
use
of
the
term
in
that
case
is
because
they
quite
clearly
said
it
did
not
have
a
secondary
meaning.
there
is
no
trademark
protection
for
descriptive
words
with
secondary
meaning,
we
are
in
complete
agreement
with
that.
we're
dealing
with
the
secondary
meaning.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
i
would
urge
you
to
look
at
joint
appendix
pages
137
to
139
where
it
lists
twenty
other
competitors
that
sell
this
very
product,
they
have
no
cause
to
use
that
word.
it
is
not
used
in
the
industry
as
a
descriptive
term,
they're
called
"pigment",
they're
called
"ink",
they're
not
called
"micro
colors",
that
is
my
client's
trademark.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
typical
suggestive
term,
it
was
created
to
associate
the
high
quality
that
my
client
markets
in
this
product
with
that
term,
i
want
the
"micro
color"
pigments,
not
the
other
pigments
that
are
sold
by--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
correct,
and
oftentimes,
trademarks
are
shortened
versions
of
other
terminology.
the
fact
is
it
is
suggestive
because
"micro
colors"
is
the
protected
trademark
here.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor,
for
purposes
of
the
defense,
it's
the
other
party
that
has
to
be
using
the
term
descriptively.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
footnote
3
of
the
red
brief
explains
that
this
purported
concession
that
they
discuss
about
the
use
of
this
mark
had
to
do
because
justice
ginsburg
was
distinguishing
before,
early
uses
on
a
bottle,
and
a
flyer,
which
we
dispute
occurred,
but
assuming
they
occurred,
those
were
descriptive.
in
1998
and
1999,
petitioner
started
using
it
on
their
marketing
brochures
in
a
very
different
manner.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
thank
you,
your
honor,
i'd
be
happy
to
discuss
that.
as
i
pointed
out,
it's
contrary
to
the
textual
language
used
by
the
congress
in
1946.
they
meant
"used
fairly"
to
mean
what
the
common
law
meant.
the
common
law
prohibited
confusing
uses
of
both
technical
trademarks
and
trade
names.
moreover,
petitioner's
interpretation
is
contrary
to
the
clear
focus
of
the
lanham
act,
which
is
to
prevent
customer
confusion.
the
whole
point
is
so
that
you
can
walk
into
a
store--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
don't
believe
it's
the
defendant's
burden,
we
believe
we...
the
district
court
was
correctly
reversed
the
ninth
circuit
in
entering
summary
judgment
against
us,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
was
dispute
regarding
likelihood
of
confusion.
and
the
district
court
did
that,
because
as
i
said
it
was
absolutely
irrelevant
to
their
determination
of
used
fairly.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
don't
agree.
we
believe
that
likelihood
of
confusion
defeats
the
fair-use
defense.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
and
we
would
point
out
that
as
a
textual
argument
and
the
purpose
argument--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
we
do
believe
that
since
the
amendment
in
1988,
this
has
ultimately
become
a
redundancy,
but
the
plaintiff's
burden
of
showing
likelihood
of
confusion--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
remains
as
a
congressional
emphasis
that
even
if,
in
a
trademark
situation,
a
use
that
is
not
likely
to
confuse
is
allowed.
that
is
what,
this
was
a--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--to
understand
why
this
came
in,
it's
important
to
understand
in
1946
this
defense
applied
only
to
incontestable
marks.
it
did
not
apply
to
other
registered
marks.
at
that
time,
incontestable
mark
holders
did
not
have
to
prove
likelihood
of
confusion.
that
incontestable
mark
was
a
conclusive
evidence
of
the
mark
holder's
exclusive
right
to
use
that
mark
on
the
same
goods.
same
mark,
on
the
same
goods
that
were
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
with
the
pto.
that
was
akin
to
early
common
law.
at
that
point,
the
plaintiff
could
go
into
court
with
their
incontestable
mark,
and
it
was
conclusive
evidence.
so
there
had
to
be
a
safety
valve
for
defendants
to
be
able
to
say,
"okay,
i
know
this
is
an
incontestable
mark,
i
know
that,
and
i
know
i'm
using
it
on
the
same
goods,
but
notwithstanding,
i
can
use
it
because
i'm
using
it
fairly,
i'm
not
confusing
consumers
with
this.
"
"that's
what
the
purpose
was.
"
"in
19--
"
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
was
presumed
by
the
weight
of
that,
that
was
the
conclusive
evidence.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
the
way
congress
structured
1115(b),
it
was
conclusive
evidence
except
subject
to
the
seven
specific
defenses,
this
was
the
fourth
one.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
i'm
sorry,
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
also
point
out
that
when
congress
amended
in
1988,
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
they
intended
to
change
this
and
that's
what's
so
fundamental
about
the
position...
the
district
court
position.
this
is
a
gaping
hole
in
the
core
purpose
of
the
lanham
act.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
not
at
all,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
if
that
were
the
case,
it
was
more
than
likely,
almost
certainly
be
a
generic
term
with
no
protection.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
and
congress
took
that
explicitly
into
account
when
it
allowed
any
mark
to
be
canceled
at
any
time
for
genericism.
escalator,
aspirin
are
all
examples
of
your
situation.
that's
exactly
what
happened,
and
when
they
came
a
generic
term,
that
trademark
was
canceled
and
it
became
used
as
generic.
congress--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--since
1988
it's
a
vestigial
reminder
of
what
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
was
understood
in
1946.
even
for
the
strongest,
incontestable
mark
on
the
same
goods,
we
are
still
going
to
always
allow
uses
that
are
not
likely
to
confuse.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
two
points,
your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--two
points.
petitioner
gives
no
meaning
to
words
"used
fairly".
so
if
a
worst
statutory
construction--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
those
are
other
terms
that
are
used
in
the
statute,
those
are
separate
requirements.
there
are
four
requirements
in
the
provision,
used
not
as
a
mark,
used
descriptively,
used
in
good
faith,
and
used
fairly.
they
read
"used
fairly"
right
out
of
the
language.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
that
is
one
of
the
factors
in
likelihood
of
confusion,
that
you
can
take
into
account,
that
there
can
be
non-trademark
uses
that
are
confusing,
but
the
common
law
cases
we
talk
about
are
full
of
examples
of
that.
i
would
like
to
make
one
other
response
to
justice
scalia's
point,
if
i
could.
justice
scalia,
to
the
extent
that
you
hold
that
the
fair-use
defense
no
longer
prohibits,
all
uses
are
likely
to
confuse
as
unfair,
we
would
look
to
the
suggestion
made
by
the
amici
that
there
is
a
middle
ground
that
likely
to
confusion,
in
any
event,
cannot
be
completely
irrelevant
to
the
used
fairly
determination,
as
petitioner
in
the
district
court
would
have
it.
we
discuss
on
page
15
of
our
brief,
for
example,
the
restatement's
position,
which
we
would
urge
the
court
to
look
to,
which
is
akin
to
what
the
amici
suggests.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
district
court's
entry
of
summary
judgment
must
be
reversed,
the
ninth
circuit
did
that
because
of
its
total
disregard
for
likely
to
confusion--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
the
ruling
from
this
court
would
have
to
be
that
it's
not
an
absolute
defense
against
likelihood
of
confusion.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
and
that
discussion
explains
a
couple
of
things.
it
explains
that
if
there
is
a
likelihood
of
substantial
confusion,
that
would
be
the
outer
limit,
ordinarily
that
would
not
be
a
fair
use.
it
also
points
out
that
likelihood
of
confusion
is
relevant
to
that
determination
that
your
honor
just
described.
yes,
we
would
win
under
that
position,
your
honor,
that's
absolutely
correct,
that's
the
middle
ground
of
the
restatement--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
we
would
actually
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below,
in
support
of
we
cite
cases
in
our
brief,
the
meritor
case
and
the
yakima
case,
in
which
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
reversing
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed,
and
there
are
other
holdings
of
the
ninth
circuit
also
that
are
not
before
the
court
that
should
be
affirmed.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor,
that's--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor,
i
understand
that,
but
in
this
particular
situation--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
certainly
would
agree,
your
honor,
that
if
we
are
then
given
an
opportunity
on
remand
to
go
back
to
summary
judgment
and
carry
our
burden
of
establishing
a
likelihood
of
confusion,
but
not
have
it
held
against
us.
for
example,
in
the
middle
ground,
to
determine
what
used
fairly
is,
in
addition
to
likelihood
of
confusion,
we
would
suggest
that
there
are
other
factors
that
the
restatement
puts
forth.
for
example,
whether
there
is
commercial
justification
for
the
use.
did
we
point
out,
there
is
no
commercial
justification,
there
are
twenty
other
competitors
that
don't
use
this
terminology.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
quite
a
strong
mark,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
we
dispute
that,
your
honor,
they've
never
produced
one
bottle
from
that
period.
in
fact,
we
introduced
four
bottles
of
their--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
your
honor.
we
maintain
that
that
is
a
mark
use.
i
mean,
the
district
court
rejected
that
as
well,
but
that
is
one
of
the
issues
where
you
suggested
that
courts
have
resolved
these
on
whether
something
is
used
as
a
mark
or
not,
that
is
not
an
easy
answer,
and
that
is
why
it's
always
part
and
parcel
of
the
likelihood
of
confusion.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
lanham
act,
to
ensure
that
when
you
go
into
a
store,
you
can
buy
the
products
you
want.
for
example,
in
the
health
and
safety
area
here,
you
may
be
willing
to
buy
a
product
that
costs
more
money
because
you
know
of
the
quality
of
them.
at
the
same
time,
you
want
to
be
assured
when
you
go
in,
because
you
don't
want
to
buy
the
one
that's
recalled
all
the
time,
or
that
has
ingredients
that
cause
allergies
for
you,
that's
what
the
lanham
act
is
to
protect.
and
it
encourages
the
economic
efficiency
of
the
market--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
directly
relevant
to
the
likelihood
of
confusion,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
typical
way
of
proving
that
when
it
ultimately
goes
to
trial
is
through
consumer
survey.
and
the
law
is
clear
that
that
survey
would
not
be
of
the
person
on
the
street,
it
would
be
of
the
appropriate
purchasers,
who
are
more
sophisticated
clinicians
and
cosmetologists.
but,
your
honor,
even
on
that
situation
in
this
record,
we
have
direct
evidence
of
confusion.
it's
at
joint
appendix
page
170,
your
honor,
it's
the
declaration
of
gloria
torres,
where
about
1998,
1999,
she
was
one
of
the
people
who
did
sales,
and
she
started
getting
calls
from
people
wanting
products,
and
it
confused
her
because
they
weren't
on
my
client's
customer
list,
and
also
they
were
citing
different
prices.
it
didn't
mean
anything
to
her
at
the
time,
it
turns
out
this
was
the
confusion
because
they
were
actually
seeing
this
new
usage
on
the
marketing
brochure
by
kp
permanent.

they
do,
your
honor,
that's
absolutely
right,
color
wheels,
color...
and
also
in
the
micro
pigmentation
history,
it's
very
important,
because
even
though
it's
like
tattooing,
the
purpose
is
absolutely
the
opposite,
it's
to
hide
the
color.
so
mixing
of
the
colors
is
a
critical
component
of
that
industry.
i
want
to
make
another
point
about
the
economic
efficiency
that
is
furthered
by
the
trademark
laws
and
not
allowing
likelihood
of
confusing
uses,
which
is
what
congress
intended.
by
allowing
purchasers
to
know
that
they're
getting
the
product
that
they
want,
they're
a
lot,
able
to
be
more
efficient
in
the
market--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
there's
nothing
to
prevent
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
anything...
the
way
that
petitioner
passed
the
lanham
act
grossly
overstates
it.
i
mean,
i
would
just
submit
the
following
list.
the
only
thing
that
the
lanham...
the
lanham
act
does
not
allow
registration
of
generic
brands,
as
we
mentioned
before.
it
allows
cancellation
of
any
mark
if
it
becomes
generic.
it
applies
only
to
commercial
uses,
not
usage
in
ordinary
english
language,
only
in
connection
with
the
mark.
it
can
only
have
a
valid
trademark
when
it's
actively
being
used,
any
mark
can
be
canceled
or
abandoned
after
three
years.
it
also,
of
course,
only
applies
when
there's
likelihood
of
confusion.
also
there
is
an
expert
agency
that
reviews
and
goes
through
a
process
in
which
there
can
be
oppositions,
objections,
all
of
this
could
be
brought
up
at
that
point.
and
also
congress
directly
addressed
anticompetitive
interests
when
it
enacted
the
statute.
it,
in
1946,
enacted
b(7)
as
a
defense
for
antitrust
violations.
it
also
reinforced
the
justice
department,
and
the
ftc
maintains
its
enforcement
authority,
and
it
also
had
a
particular
provision
that
allowed
the
ftc
to
go
in
and
cancel
registration.
i'd
also
point
out--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--at
this
point
in
time,
your
honor.
i
would
also
point
out
economic
efficiency--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
in
this
case,
it...
this
mark
has
been
put
through
becoming
to...
but
went
through
all
of
the
procedures
that
the
pto
required.
there's
no
question
that
this
is
a
valid
mark.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
no,
what
i...
the
government's
position
is
the
same
position
that,
in
fact,
it
urged
before
congress
in
1946.
the
court's
opinion
in
park
'n
fly
makes
this
clear.
they
did
not
want
descriptive
terms
at
all
protected,
even
with
secondary
meaning.
and
as
the
park
'n
fly
opinion
makes
clear,
congress
rejected
that
and
struck
the
balance
this
way
and
included
all
of
these
other
safeguards,
not
allowing
registration
of
generic
marks,
always
prohibiting
uses
that
are
likely
to
confuse.
we
would
also
point
out
that
that
encourages
economic
efficiencies
for
businesses
as
well.
by
being
able
to
benefit
from
the
reputation
of
your
mark,
the
business
invests
more.
as
soon
as
confusion
is
allowed,
there
is
a
free
rider
problem,
and
that
competitor
is
free
riding
on
that
investment.
and
it's
a
disincentive
for
further
investment
and
it
undermines
the
quality
of
the
goods,
because
the
only
way--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
believe
that
the
restatement
and
the
amici
are
very
consistent
in
rejecting
petitioner's
position
and
the
district
court's
position
that
likelihood
of
confusion
is
completely
irrelevant.
we
embrace
that,
i
think
that's
a
consistent
position,
and
that
would
be
the
bottom
line,
i
would
urge,
on
this
court,
because
petitioner's
position
in
the
district
court
wreaks
havoc,
truly,
with
the
statutory
framework
that
congress
set
up
and
intended.
we
believe
as
a
matter
of
strict
statutory
construction,
that
indeed
it
is
now
a
vestigial
provision,
the
fair-use
defense,
after
the
1988
changes
to
the
inconstestability
provision.
but
if
the
court
is
not
going
to
hold
that
that
fair-use
defense
prohibits
uses
that
are
likely
to
confuse,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
adopt
the
restatement
position,
that
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
likelihood
of
confusion
is
relevant,
we
think
factors
that
it's
confusing
in
relationship
to
a
health
and
safety
issue
would
be
relevant,
the
investment
by
the
mark
holder
could
be
relevant.
and
to
the
extent
the
competitor
had
a
commercial
justification
for
it,
because
it
was
a
term
that
everyone
needed
to
use,
but
"micro
colors"
is
just
not
that
kind
of
terminology
as
the
record
in
this
case
demonstrates.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor.
