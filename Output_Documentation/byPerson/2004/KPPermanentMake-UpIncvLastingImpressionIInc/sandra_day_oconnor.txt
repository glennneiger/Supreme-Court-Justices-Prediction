justice
sandra

in
this
case,
did
the
plaintiff
offer
any
evidence
of
confusion,
consumer
confusion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
there
anything
in
the
affidavits
or
attachments
that
have
to
do
with
consumer
confusion
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
might
make
it
necessary
for
a
defendant
in
such
a
situation,
in
order
to
avoid
some
kind
of
summary
judgement,
to
also
offer
evidence
on
consumer
confusion
to
try
to
show
there
wasn't
any.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
possible
that
showing
consumer
confusion
could
be
considered
by
the
court
on
the
issue
of
what's
the
fair
use?
what's
fair?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
your
position
that
subjective
good
faith
is
always
a
defense,
no
matter
how
unreasonable
it
is
or
how
much
confusion
results?
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
that
consumer
confusion
is
one
factor
in
determining
fairness;
perhaps
not
subjective
good
faith,
but
certainly
on
the
issue
of
fairness.
some
of
the
amici
take
that
position,
do
they
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does...
does
consumer--
--if
substantial
consumer
confusion
is
shown
by
the
plaintiff,
is
that
enough
to
defeat
a
fair-use
defense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you'd
still
have
to
vacate
the
judgment
below,
which
seemed
to
go
too
far
in
saying
that
if
there
is
any
consumer
confusion,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
wouldn't
we
just
vacate
it,
and
you
have
other
grounds
that
the
court
below
didn't
address,
but
why
wouldn't,
at
the
very
least,
we
vacate
the
judgment
and
send
it
back?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
certainly
the
restatement
and
the
view
of
some
of
the
amici
is
contrary
to
yours
on
this.
