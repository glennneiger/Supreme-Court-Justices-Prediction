we'll

argument
now
on
no.
03-409,
kp
permanent
make-up,
inc.
versus
lasting
impression,
inc.--
mr.
machat?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
agree
with
judge
niemeyer's
comment
in
the
fourth
circuit
case,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did...
what
did
the
district
court
do
here?
did
it
grant
summary
judgement
or
deny
summary
judgement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
you
had
a...
if
you
had
a
headline
at
the
head
of
an
ad,
"great
sale",
that
surely
is
not
a
trademark,
just
because
you
have
it
in
boldfaced
print.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
go
further
in
that
same
paragraph,
and
the
last
couple
of
lines
refer
to
a
lindy
pen
case,
according
to...
the
way
they
described,
explaining
that
the
fair-use
defense
is
not
available
if
likelihood
of
confusion
has
been
shown.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
machat.
now,
ms.
millett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
ms.
brinkmann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
this
is
really
quite
confusing,
ms.
brinkmann.
the
question
presented,
as
several
people
have
pointed
out,
whether
the
lanham
act's
fair-use
defense
to
trademark
infringement
requires
a
party
asserting
the
defense
to
demonstrate
the
absence
of
a
likelihood
it
could
confuse...
consumer
confusion.
now,
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
surely
answer
that,
"we
agree",
or
"we
don't
agree".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
urging
then
that
the
ninth
circuit
be
affirmed
on
alternate
grounds.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
rarely
do
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
a
really
expert
agency,
which
you
referred
to
as
represented
by
the
government
here,
and
it
takes
the
position
quite
different
from
yours.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
are
you
saying
at
this
point
in
time?
are
you
suggesting
they'll
take
a
different
position
some
other
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nobody
is
challenging
it,
it's
the
fair-use
defense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
mr.
machat,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
machat,
the
case
is
submitted.
