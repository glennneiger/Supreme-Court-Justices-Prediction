justice

bader

but
the
district
court...
the
district
court...
this
way--
[laughter]
--seemed
to
focus
on
the
use
of
the
word
"micro
color",
just
the
word.
it
didn't
bring
up
what
was
new
in
1999.
that
is,
a
brochure
appears
where
"micro
color"
is
not
simply
a
word,
but
it
appears
in
a
logo-like
fashion.
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
said
you
could
use
1991.
it
didn't
refer
to
the
stylized
1999
new
appearance.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
it
might
not
have
been
confusion
just
by
using
the
word.
but
when
you're
using
it
in
the
logo-like
appearance,
maybe
that's
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
ninth...
the
ninth
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
did
put
an
initial
burden
on
the
trademark-holder
to
prove
confusion.
if
you
look
at
the
petition
for
cert,
6a,
in
its
opinion,
it
seems
to
recognize
that
the
trademark-holder
must
show
that
the
alleged
infringer's
use
of
the
mark
is
likely
to
cause
confusion
or
to
cause
mistake
or
to
deceive.
so
this
opinion
starts
out
by
saying,
"yes,
we
know
that
under
the
lanham
act
the
trademark-holder
is
obliged
to
show
likelihood
of
confusion.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
do
have
one
authority
for
that
proposition.
they
cite
mccarthy,
and
i
think
they're
right
about
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
a
treatise
writer
who
does
take
the
position
that
if
there's
confusion,
there's
no
fair-use
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
does
the...
what
is
it...
the
unfair
competition
restatement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
we're
dealing
with
an
incontestable
mark
here,
and
the
secondary
meaning
would
be
assumed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there...
wasn't
there
something
to
the
effect
that
"micro
pigmentation"
is
a
synonym
in
the
trade
for
permanent
make-up?
it's
another
name
for
permanent
make-up,
and
it's...
it
has
"micro"
in
it,
"micro
pigmentation".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
"micro
pigmentation"
sounds
awfully
close
to
"micro
color".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
tell
whether
it's
used
as
a
mark?
i
mean,
is
that...
that
certainly
seems
to
be
central.
is
it
used
as
a
mark?
and
if
it's
used
as
a
mark,
then
there
is
a
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
let's
go
back
to
the
use
on
the
brochure
of
a
logo-like...
i
mean,
as
long
as
they're
using
just
the
word
"micro
color",
i
see
your
position
entirely,
it's
used
descriptively,
not
as
a
mark.
but
what
about
when
they
use
something
that
looks
like
a
mark?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
the
difference
between
pigment
and
color,
especially
when
it's
not
just
"micro
color",
don't
they
advertise
"micro
color
red",
"micro
color
grey",
so
pigment--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but,
what
about
the
word,
is
it...
am
i
wrong
in
what
i
suggested
before,
that
the
word,
"micro
pigmentation"
is
used
in
the
trade
as
a
synonym
for
permanent
makeup?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brinkmann,
may
i
stop
you
there,
because
i
thought
you
have
conceded,
as
i
think
you
must,
i
thought
you
conceded
quite
clearly,
i
wrote
down
that
you
said,
it
is
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
show
likelihood
of
confusion.
so,
if
it's
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
show
likelihood
of
confusion,
how
can
it
be
the
defendant's
burden
to
show
unlikelihood
of
confusion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
they
did
when
they
outlined
to
us
what
it
means
is
you're
using
it
descriptively,
and
not
as
a
mark.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brinkmann,
am
i
right
that
several
cases
say,
the
key
here
is,
are
you
using
it
as
a
mark.
because
that
suggests
you're
trying
to
pawn
off
your
goods
as
another's.
are
you
using
it
as
a
mark?
or,
are
you
using
it,
merely
descriptively?
i
thought
use
as
a
mark
was
the
key,
you're
using
it
as
a
mark,
you're
not
using
it
in
good
faith.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
if
the
ruling
were
a
defendant
who
uses
a
descriptive
term
fairly
and
in
good
faith
to
describe
its
goods
or
services
is
not
liable
for
infringement,
even
if
some
residual
confusion
is
likely.
that's
what
the
restatement
that
you've
just
been
applauding
says.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
would
win--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ms.
brinkmann,
am
i
right
that
they
were,
kp,
they
were
in
fact
using
the
word
"micro
color"
before
you
registered
your
trademark?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
be...
that
would
be
a
disputed
issue
of
fact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
are
we
making
any
differentiation
at
all
between
the
mini
color
red
or
whatever,
and
this
logo
that
appears?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
not
assailing
the
validity
of
the
mark.
