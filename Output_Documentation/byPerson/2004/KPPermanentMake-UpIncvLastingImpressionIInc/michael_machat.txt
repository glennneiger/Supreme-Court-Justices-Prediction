mr.
michael
machat
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
whether
or
not
a
defendant
in
a
trademark
case
who
fulfills
the
statutory
requirements
of
the
fair-use
defense
must
also
demonstrate
an
absence
of
likelihood
of
confusion
in
order
to
avail
himself
of
that
affirmative
defense.
now,
here
are
four
reasons
why
that
should
not
be
the
case.
in
the
first
place,
if
that
is
the
case
it
would
render
the
defense
useless,
because
if
there
is
no
likelihood
of
confusion,
then
there's
no
trademark
infringement
to
begin
with,
so
why
should
someone
try
to
prove
an
affirmative
defense
when
there's
no
trademark
infringement?
second--
mr.
michael
machat
--yes.
secondly,
what
it
does
is,
is
it
shifts
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
plaintiff
to
the
defendant.
there's
no
reason
ever
to...
there's
no
reason
ever
to
prove
an
absence
of
likelihood
of
confusion
if
you're
a
defendant.
and
then,
also...
there's
no
reason
to
prove
the
fair-use
defense
if
you
have
to
also
prove
an
absence
of
likelihood
of
confusion,
because
it's
just
much
more
of
a
burden.
you
have
to
prove,
first
of
all--
mr.
michael
machat
--this
was
a
motion
for
summary
judgement.
mr.
michael
machat
yeah,
actually,
the
record
does
contain
some
references
to
confusion.
the...
in
this
case,
the
respondent,
they
were
claiming
that
they
did
have
some
people
that
actually
were
confused.
and
when
that
happens,
you
need
to
look
at
what
is
causing
the
confusion.
and
essentially--
mr.
michael
machat
--well,
but
that's
shifting
the
issue,
then,
to
whether
or
not
there's
likelihood
of
confusion.
however,
even
if
there...
what
i'm
saying
is
even
if
there
is
confusion,
if
you
meet
the
elements
of
the
fair-use
defense,
it
doesn't
matter
if
there's
any
resulting
confusion.
mr.
michael
machat
well,
the
thing
is,
a
lot
of
times
when
there
is
confusion,
that
is
evidence
that
the
term
or
the
word
being
used
is
not
being
used
as
a
mark,
so
the
confusion
illustrates
that...
one
of
the
elements
of
the
fair-use
defense,
whether
or
not
the
term
is
being
used
descriptively
or
as
a
mark,
whether
or
not
those
elements
are
being
met.
the
confusion
does
not
go
to
the
likelihood
of
confusion
issue;
rather,
it
goes
to
the
individual
elements
of
the
fair-use--
mr.
michael
machat
--yes...
well,
that
would
show
an
absence
of
good
faith,
and
good
faith
is
one
of
the
elements
of
the
fair-use
defense.
mr.
michael
machat
no,
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
it's
a
balancing
sentence
where
it
says
"fairly
and
in
good
faith",
and
you
have
to
look
at
how
descriptive
the
word
is,
in
particular.
for
instance,
if
you're
using
the
word
"best"...
as
in
"best
buy"
or
"best
foods"...
i
mean,
best
is
an
extremely
descriptive
word.
so
you
could
go
a
lot
further
in
claiming,
"hey,
i
have
the
best...
i
have
the
best
food.
"
or,
you
know,
"come
to
my
store.
"
"i
have
the
best
buy.
"
and,
yes,
there
could
be
confusion,
but
that
is
one
of
the
risks
that--
mr.
michael
machat
--no,
i
wouldn't
go
that
far,
because
you
also
have
to
look
at
the
objective
use.
mr.
michael
machat
well,
i
think...
i
was
reading
the
amici
brief
last
night.
i
think
the
issue
of
confusion,
as
the
amicus
brief
points
out,
you
have
to
look
at
whether
the
confusion
is
illustrative
of
whether
or
not
the
term
is
being
used
as
a
mark
or
not.
the
same
evidence
that
shows
confusion
can
be
used
to
show
a
likelihood
of
confusion
on
the
plaintiff's
side
of
the
case,
and
that
same
evidence
can
also
be
used
to...
in
the
case
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
elements
of
a
fair-use
defense
have
been...
have
been
met.
mr.
michael
machat
the...
well,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgement
on
a
fair-use
defense.
it
found
that,
in
this
case,
the
mark
was
being
used...
sorry,
that
my
client's
words
were
being
used
not
as
a
mark,
only
to
describe,
and
that
the
use
was
done
fairly
and
in
good
faith.
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
michael
machat
--yes,
that
is
correct.
the
district
court,
in
its
opinion,
did
not
specifically
refer
to
that
use
in
1999.
mr.
michael
machat
well,
in
the
abstract
case,
it
could
be.
i
would
argue,
though,
in
this
case
it's
not,
because
that
was
one
use
on
a...
you
have
a
ten-page
brochure,
and
it's
one
use
on
a
ten-page
brochure.
and
you...
on
that
same
page
of
the
brochure,
at
the
very
bottom,
it
said
my
client's
name,
kp
permanent
makeup.
so--
mr.
michael
machat
--correct.
mr.
michael
machat
yes,
i
would
agree.
mr.
michael
machat
yes,
i
think--
mr.
michael
machat
--i
think
we're
both
saying
the
same
thing--
mr.
michael
machat
--no,
i
agree.
mr.
michael
machat
absolutely.
mr.
michael
machat
that's
exactly--
mr.
michael
machat
--where
we
are.
mr.
michael
machat
in
my
particular
case?
this--
mr.
michael
machat
--okay.
mr.
michael
machat
let's
use
the
words
"best
buy".
best
buy
is
a
famous
consumer
electronics
store,
and
somebody
opens
up
a
shop,
say
mark's,
that
says,
"mark's,
he
has
the
best
buy.
"
he
wants
to
advertise
on
radio,
"come
down
to
mark's
electronics
for
the
best
buy...
for
the
best
buy
in
consumer
electronics,
go
to
mark's.
"
and
he
keeps
using
those
words
"best
buy".
mr.
michael
machat
well--
mr.
michael
machat
--okay,
in
that
case
there
would
be
confusion,
but
mark,
in
that
case,
would
be
using
"best
buy"
as
a
trademark,
not
only
to
describe;
and,
therefore,
he
would
not
fulfill
the
statutory
requirements
of
a
fair-use
defense.
because
a
lot
of
times
when
confusion
comes
up,
it
comes
up
in
the
case
that--
mr.
michael
machat
--well,
it
would
be
evidence
that
it
is
a
trademark.
you
have
to...
it
depends
how
big
the
words
"best
buy"
were
in
relation
to
the
word
"mark's
electronics".
mr.
michael
machat
i
agree,
it's
not
necessarily
a
trademark.
you
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
ad,
and
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
person
is
trying
to
use
to
help
consumers
to
identify
and
distinguish
the
products,
or,
in
this
case,
the
store.
mr.
michael
machat
well--
mr.
michael
machat
--yes,
but
i'd
go
even
further
and
say
that
the...
if
you
had
a
big
sign
that
said
"park
'n
fly",
and
it's
next
to
an
airport,
that
would
not
necessarily
be
a
trademark.
i
mean,
if
it
said,
like,
"jerry's
airport
parking,
park
and
fly.
"
i
would
say
that's
being
a
descriptive
use.
but
some
people
may
argue
differently
in
that
case.
mr.
michael
machat
they
do
it.
but
then
on...
if
you
look
on
page
17a
of
my
cert
petition,
the
same
opinion,
the
ninth
circuit
later
on
go
on
to
say,
in
the
middle
paragraph,
"as
expressed
in
kahn's,
the
fair-use
analysis
only
complements
the
likelihood
of
confusion...
likelihood
of
customer
confusion
analysis.
"
and
then
they
quote
from
transgo,
and
they
say...
explain
that
"anyone
is
free
to
use
the
term
in
its
primary
descriptive
sense
as
long
as
such
use
does
not
result
in
consumer
confusion
as
to
the
source
of
goods.
"
in
effect,
what
they're
doing
is,
they're
expanding
the
rights
of
trademark-holders
of
descriptive
words.
essentially
what
they're
saying
is--
mr.
michael
machat
--right,
and
that's...
that's
where
they're
negating
what
they
said
in
the
beginning
of
their
opinion.
mr.
michael
machat
well,
they
do
cite
mccarthy,
but
i
would
submit
that
mccarthy
is
incorrect,
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
machat
well,
there
are
other
treatise
writers...
kane,
for
example,
takes
the
contrary
position
and
says
that
fair
use
will
always
be
a
defense,
even
if--
--even
if
there
is
likelihood
of
confusion.
mr.
michael
machat
yes,
that
takes
a
similar
position,
as
well,
that
there
can
be
confusion
and
fair
use
at
the
same
time.
again,
you
have
to
look
at
what's
causing
the
confusion.
and
most
often
the
problem
is
the
confusion
is
being
caused
because
the
person
with
the
words
in
question
is
using
it
as
a
mark,
and
that's
causing
the
confusion.
if...
there's
certain...
there's
certain...
there's
certain
terms
and
words
that
congress
has
said
never
get
trademark
protection.
descriptive
words,
of
course,
is
one
of
them,
in
the
sense
that
they
can
never
get
trademark
protection
in
their
primary
descriptive
sense;
they
only
get
trademark
protection
in
their...
in
their
secondary-meaning
sense
if
they
can
actually
prove
secondary
meaning.
mr.
michael
machat
yes.
in
the
case
of
an
incontestable
mark,
secondary
meaning
is
presumed;
however,
that
still
does
not
take
away
the
burden
of
the
holder
of
an
incontestable
mark
of
proving
likelihood
of
confusion.
and,
second,
the
trademark
protection
attaches
only
to
the
secondary
meaning
of
the
mark,
never
to
the
primary,
descriptive
meaning
of
the
words
in
question.
and
one
other
quick
example.
the
laws
say
you
cannot
obtain
a
trademark
in
the
u.s.
flag.
now,
we
have
12
ice-cream
manufacturers,
they
each
put
the
flag
on
their
ice
cream.
there
will
be
confusion
there.
someone
will
say,
"i
want
the
ice
cream
with
the
flag
on
it.
"
but
they
all
have
a
flag
on
it.
that's
another
example
where
congress
said,
"we
will
tolerate
confusion".
sometimes
we
tolerate
confusion
so
we
can
free
up
descriptive
words
so
business
owners
are
free
to
describe
their
goods
to
consumers.
and,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
machat
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
ms.
brinkmann's
reference
to
the
legislative
history
is
incorrect,
and
i'd
just
like
to
refer
the
court's
attention
to
my
reply
brief,
pages
14
to
17
where
basically
it
shows
that
prior
to
1988,
courts
were
required
to
find
a
likelihood
of
confusion
before
finding
for
the
plaintiff
on
a
trademark
case.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
trademark
is
not
for
the
word
"micro
color",
the
trademark
is
for
the
logo
mark,
and
here's
some
of
the
confusion.
the
respondents
were
able
to
obtain
a
trademark
registration
for
the
logo
itself,
and
the
strength
in
the
logo
itself
is
not
being
copied,
we're
just
using
the
descriptive
words
within
the
logo
itself.
and
congress
always
intended
for
descriptive
words
to
be
free
for
everybody
to
use
in
their
primary
descriptive
sense,
so
long
as
the
person,
the
subsequent
user,
is
not
using
those
descriptive
words
in
the
secondary
meaning
sense,
and
that's
the
distinction.
the
confusion
is
only
an
issue
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
elements
of
the
fair-use
defense
is
being
met,
but
that
confusion
should
be
distinguished
from
likelihood
of
confusion.
confusion
is
a
factual
determination,
likelihood
of
confusion
is
a
legal
determination.
so
you
can
use
whether
or
not
there
is
actual
confusion
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
word
is
being
used
as
a
mark.
mr.
michael
machat
i
would
agree,
the
degree
of
confusion,
but
that
comes
into
whether
or
not--
mr.
michael
machat
--in
this
case,
"used
fairly"
means,
it
does
mean
something,
we're
saying
used
fairly
refers
to
whether
or
not
the
use
is
a
truthful
or
reasonably
accurate
description
of
the
mark.
and
it
always...
truthful
is
something
that
the
common
law
always
looked
at
to
see,
that
was
a
term
used,
in
fact,
by
this
court
in
the
warner
decision,
basically,
to
quote
briefly
from
that
decision,
it
said
"the
use
of
similar
names
by
another
to
truthfully
describe
the
same
product
does
not
constitute
legal
or
moral
wrong.
"
so
i
would
maintain
that
"used
fairly"
means
truthful,
or
can
determine
whether
or
not
it's
exactly
true,
reasonably
accurate.
and
that
would
be
the
meaning
of
"used
fairly".
and
of
course,
good
faith
refers
to
the
intent,
and
there
you
have
the
elements
of
the
fair-use
defense.
also,
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
once
again
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
it
says
on
the
bottom
of
page
17a,
it
says,
"kp
can
only
benefit
from
the
fair-use
defense
if
there
is
no
likelihood
of
confusion
between
kp's
use
of
the
term'micro
color',
and
lasting's
mark.
"
and
then
they
go
on
to
say,
"as
discussed
above,
because
in
this
case
they
can
be
no
fair
use....
"
