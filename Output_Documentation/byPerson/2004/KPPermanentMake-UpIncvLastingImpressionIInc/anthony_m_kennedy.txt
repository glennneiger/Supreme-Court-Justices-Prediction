justice
anthony
m.

well,
but
i'm
interested
in
justice
o'connor's
point.
suppose
it's
a
close
case
as
to
whether
or
not
the
use
is
in
good
faith
and
it's
only
discretion.
with
reference
to
good
faith,
suppose
there's
very
substantial
confusion
that's
caused
by
the
allegedly
infringing
mark.
does
that
at
least
bear
on
a
good-faith
assessment?
in
other
words,
suppose
that
it
were
shown
that
the
owner
of
the
non-registered
mark,
the
alleged
infringing
mark,
used
the
phrase...
not
the
mark,
but
used
the
phrase...
deliberately
in
order
to
cause
confusion.
would
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
so
that
if
you
know
that
there's
going
to
be
confusion,
there
is
no
good
faith?
you
wouldn't
go
that
far.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
if
you
have
a
sign
that
says
"park
'n
fly"
and
an
arrow,
with
a
capital
"p"
and
a
capital
"f",
then
it's
arguably
being
used
as
a
trademark.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whereas,
if
you
say
in
a
brochure,
"rent
a
car
from
us,
and
park
and
fly.
"
then
that's
okay.
is
that
the
distinction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose,
in
the
coco-quinine
case,
the
non...
the
non-holder
is
doing
just
fine
without
using
the
particular
term,
and
then
he
decides,
"you
know,
i'm
going
to
cut
into
that
market,
and
i'm
going
to
use
the
term
coco-quinine.
"
"and
i'm
going
to
do
that
just
in
order
to
get
more
customers
away
from
the
trademark-holder.
"
is
that
good
faith?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
that,
all
we
need
to
decide
this
case
is
to
assume
that
it's
descriptive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
it
was
descriptive,
would
the
ninth
circuit
test
still
apply?
that
you
would
have
to
show
absence
of
confusion
before
you
raised
the
good
faith
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
you
agree,
then,
that
in
a
case
where
the
mark
is
descriptive,
the
non-trademark
holder,
the
defendant
in
the
case,
can
raise
the
fair-use
defense
without
having
to
show
that
there's
no
confusion?
