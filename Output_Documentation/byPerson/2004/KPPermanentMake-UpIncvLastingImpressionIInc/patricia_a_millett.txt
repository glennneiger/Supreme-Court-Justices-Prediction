mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
scalia,
you
asked
for
an
example
of
a
case
where
there
might
be
confusion,
but
there
would
still
be
a
fair
use.
this
court's
decision
in
william
warner
versus
eli
lilly,
which
was
a
common-law
case
cited
on
page
27
of
our
brief,
gives
an
example
of
that.
you
had
coco-quinine,
and
quin-coco
being
sold.
and
this
court
held,
as
a
matter
of
the
common
law
fair-use
doctrine,
that
the
descriptive...
fair,
truthful,
descriptive
use
of
a
term
to
describe
a
product
will
be
permitted
even
if
consumer
mistakes
result.
there
are
other
cases
cited
in
the
brief.
howe
scale
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
canal
company
versus
farr
case.
the
fair-use
defense
that's
at
issue
here
takes
its...
has
its
roots
in
that
common
law
precedent,
and
that
common
law
precedent,
in
origin,
speaks
directly,
justice
o'connor,
to
your...
and
justice
kennedy...
to
your
questions
about,
what
does
a
fairness
component
of
this
test
in
the
statute
mean.
there
is
not
a
general
requirement
that
the...
say,
the
defendant
here;
the
parties
were
reversed,
but
the
non-trademark
holder
acts
fairly.
that's
not
what
congress
said.
it
says
the
term...
and
i'm...
and
you
can
see,
on
page
9a
of
the
statutory
appendix
to
our
brief--
--the
term
has
to
be
used
fairly
and
in
good
faith...
putting
that
aside,
used
fairly
only
to
describe
the
product.
that
is
not
some
sort
of
general
equitable
receptacle
for
fairness
concerns.
that
focuses
on
what
the
defendant
did
and
how
they
acted
in
describing.
that's
not
a
test
of
how
the
public
reacted.
how
did
the
defendant
behave?
which
is
exactly
what
william
warner,
canal
company,
and
howe
scale
also
looked
at.
in
common
parlance,
in
a
common
dictionary
meaning,
when
you
talk
about
fairly
describing
something,
that's
not
general
equity.
that
is,
is
it
a
legitimate,
reasonable,
proper,
objectively
apt,
and
fair
way
to
describe
a
product.
one
could
reasonably--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--not
by
itself,
no,
justice
o'connor.
congress
told
us
what
will
defeat
the
defense,
and
that
is
a...
that
is
a
conclusion
that
the
term
is
being
used
as
a
mark.
consumer
confusion
might
be,
if
you
could
explain
that
that
demonstrates
that
it's
being
used
as
a
mark.
it
might
show
that
you're
not
objectively,
reasonably,
accurately
describing
your
product.
if
i
describe
twinkies
as
a
sugary
snack,
that's
a...
i
can
fairly
describe
twinkies
as
a
sugary
snack.
i
can't
fairly
describe
twinkies
as
a
healthy
food.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes,
because
there's
nothing,
in
the
marketplace,
with
wanting
to
increase
your
business
and
to
do
better
and
to
use
descriptive
terms
descriptively
to
do
that.
the
good-faith--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--continued
here--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
good-faith
element
is,
do
i
intend...
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
"causing
confusion".
if
i
intend
to
freeload
or
ride
or
exploit
the
secondary--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--meaning
of
the
term--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
what
good
faith
means
in
trademark
law,
generally.
it
has
an
established
component.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
if
i
intend
to
do
that.
but
just
showing
that
consumer
confusion
could
result,
or
that
i
hope
consumers
will
pause
and
think
about,
you
know,
"what...
what's
in
the...
what
am
i
now
being
offered
in
the
marketplace?
"
but
i
have
to...
if
i
intend
to
avail
myself
of
the
secondary
meaning
that
you've
established
of
the
goodwill
that
you've
generated,
that's
what
good
faith
goes
to.
but
to
use
fairly
to
describe
is
not
a
general
means
of
just
saying--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--if
there's
confusion,
that's
a
bad--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
term
"micro
color"
describes--
--this
is
not
my
area
of
expertise,
but...
describes,
as
i
understand
it,
the
inks
that
are
used
for
this
permanent
make-up
process.
and
the
reason
it's
called
"micro
color"--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
wouldn't
begin
to
know
whether
other
professions
or
occupations
use
the
term
"micro
color".
but
my
understanding,
from
the
record,
is
that
the
color
is
obvious.
that's...
it's
different
color
inks.
and
the
reason
that
they
use
the
term
98
of
the
first
volume
of
the
joint
appendix,
is
that
the
molecular
size
of
these
inks
is
very,
very
fine.
it's
going
into
the
skin.
it's
micron-size.
and
so
that's,
i
think,
the...
as
suggested
by
petitioner's
client...
that
that's
the
origin
of
the
term
"micro
color".
now,
"micro"
is
a
common
term
that's...
common
descriptive
term
in
its
own
right.
it
appears
in
many
contexts.
obviously,
computers
is
one
that
we're
all
familiar
with.
medical
devices
often
will
refer
to
"micro".
but
"micro
color"--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
my
understanding,
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
"micro
color",
yeah.
that's
my
understanding.
again,
i
don't
really
want
to
weigh
in
on
one
side
of
the
dispute
or
the
other
on
the
merits
of
whether
"micro
color"
is
a
generic
or
a--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but,
justice
scalia,
the
problem
here
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
what
makes
them
lose
is
not
that
they
didn't
use
this
fairly
to
describe
their
product,
or
not
that
they
failed
to
act
in
good
faith,
or
not
that
they
were
using
this
as
a
trademark,
but
that
it
was
a--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
right.
and
my
understanding...
again,
the
record
shows
that,
in
fact,
the
descriptive
use
of
this
was
conceded
in
this
case,
and
that's
on
page
29a
of
the
petition
appendix,
and
also
in
the
joint
appendix
on
152.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but,
again,
our
concern
is
that
this
statute
has
to
be
read
with
the
terms
congress
enacted.
congress
drew
a
balance
here.
congress
struck
the
balance
between
allowing...
giving
unprecedented
protection
that
this
court
recognized
in
"park
'n
fly"
two
descriptive
terms,
but
policing
the
line
between
the
secondary
meaning
that
attaches
to
descriptive
terms
and
the...
reserving
for
the
marketplace,
for
competition,
the
availability
of
descriptive
terms
in
their
original
descriptive
sense.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
exactly.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
exactly.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that's
exactly
right.
there's
a
tradeoff.
when
you
pick
a
descriptive
term,
you
get
right
up
front,
right
up
front,
the
immediate
appeal
and
resonance
of
a
term
to
the...
to
the
consumers.
"best
buy".
who
wouldn't
want
the
best
buy?
i
want
the
best
buy.
"chunky"
candy
bars.
it's
going
to
be
easier
to
break
into
the
marketplace
with
"chunky"
candy
bars
or
"almond
joy"
candy
bars,
because
consumers
will
have
a
sense
of
what
they're
getting,
than
if
you
come
in
with
a--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--"schwartz"
candy
bar,
"kodak",
i
don't
know--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
don't
know
why
that
is,
and
why
would
i
want
to
eat
it.
they're
going
to
have
to
do
more
work.
but
the
downside,
the
tradeoff,
is,
as
you
said,
justice
scalia,
that
you
do
not
get
to
take
those
terms
out
of
usage.
trademark
law
protects
usage,
not
words.
and
if
the
usage
is
descriptive,
and
it's
fair,
in
the
sense
that
it's
reasonable,
apt,
and
accurate,
as
this
court
said
in
william
warner,
canal
company,
howe
scale,
in
the
unfair-competition
sense;
and
the
kellogg
versus
national
biscuit
company,
the
shredded
wheat
case,
if
it's
apt
and
accurate,
that's
what
"used
fairly"
means.
and
if
its
satisfies
that
objective
test,
and
if
it
satisfies
the
subjective
good-faith
test,
and
it's
not
used
as
a
mark,
we
will
tolerate
that
confusion,
because
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
fair-use
defense
is
unavailable
if
it's
used
as
a
mark.
there
are
other--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--defenses
that
are
available,
but
the
fair-use
defense
is,
by
definition,
unavailable.
that's
correct.
the
way
you
prove
whether
something
is
used
as
a
mark...
there's,
sort
of,
two
ways
of
getting
to
that
end.
when
something
is
used
as
a
mark,
that
means
it
is
signifying
to
the
origin
or
source
of
those
goods
in
the
marketplace.
it's
not
just
describing
it,
it's
telling
you
who
is
making
it
or
who
is
putting
it
out
on
the
market.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
there's...
there's
going
to
be
difficult
questions
of
proof.
our
position
is
that,
by
taking
a
descriptive
term,
you
don't
get
to
consign
everybody
else
to
ten
point
times
new
roman
font,
and
that
they
can
do
some
colorful
display,
but
not
a
mark.
