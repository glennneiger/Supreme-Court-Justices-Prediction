justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
wouldn't
relate
to
the
question
presented
here,
anyway.
it
wouldn't
relate
to
the
reason
for
which
we
took
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
maybe
the
district
court
misinterpreted
or
misapplied
"fairly
and
in
good
faith"
if
it
didn't
consider
the
logo-like
use.
but,
as
i
understand
it,
the
only
question
we
have
before
us
is
whether
the
"fairly
and
in
good
faith"
provision
is
an
exception
even
when
there
is
confusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
give
us
a...
i'd
be
much
more
sympathetic
to
your
case
if
i
could
readily
envision
a
situation
where
there
is
confusion
but,
nonetheless,
the
use
is
fair
and
in
good
faith.
give
me
a
clear
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
mean,
make
up
one--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
really
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
there's
any
likelihood
of
confusion
there,
do
you?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
if
he
just
takes
out
an
ad
that
says,
"best
buy",
exclamation
point?
that
would
be
closer.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
mean
to
make
it
that
in
my
hypothetical.
you're
just
putting
it
in
bold
type
at
the
beginning
of
the
piece,
"best
buy",
exclamation
point.
that
means
it's
a
trademark?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
if
he
intends
to
increase
his
market
share
precisely
by
causing
the
confusion?
that
would
eliminate
the
good-faith
element,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
to
weigh
in
on
it.
i
mean,
you
have
to
show
that
the...
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
think
that
side
should
win,
that
the
words
are
being
used
in
a
descriptive
sense.
and
if
"micro
color"
doesn't
mean
a
blessed
thing
to
anybody
unless
they
associate
it
with
the
trademark,
then,
it
seems
to
me,
you
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
right,
that's
not
the
issue
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
if
you
choose
to
use
a
descriptive
term
as
your
logo,
you
take
your
chances--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
that
descriptive
term
will
be
used
fairly
and
in
good
faith
by
somebody
else
and
cause
confusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
don't
want
confusion,
pick
a
term
that
isn't
descriptive.
justice
antonin
scalia
"schwartz",
"schwartz"
candy
bars.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
do
anything
for
you.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
use
a
fanciful
term
descriptively?
i
mean,
i
think
that's
the
definition
of
an
arbitrary
or
fanciful
term,
that
it
doesn't
mean
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
object
to
the
formulation
of
the
question
presented?
here's
the
question,
does
the
classic
fair-use
defense
to
trademark
infringement
require
the
party
asserting
the
defense
to
demonstrate
an
absence
of
likelihood
of
confusion?
that's
the
question.
and
you
say,
"no".
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
this
still
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
defense
and
not
to
the
question
presented.
the
question
presented
is,
descriptive
or
not
descriptive,
do
you
have
a
defense
if
it's,
if
there
is
consumer
confusion?
and
your
position,
if
you're
opposing
the
question
presented,
is
that
if
there
is
consumer
confusion,
there
is
no
defense.
and
it's...
i
thought
that
was
the
only
question
you
were
going
to
discuss
here,
not
in
fact
whether,
if
there
is
such
a
defense,
it
has
been
made
out
in
this
case,
because
these
words
were
or
were
not
descriptive.
i
mean,
that's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
we
don't
usually
interpret
statutes
that
way.
i
mean,
you
tell
us
what
congress
had
in
mind,
but
our
best
indication
of
what
congress
had
in
mind
is
the
words
of
the
statute.
and
the
words
of
the
statute
make
no
sense
if
they
say
you
have
to
prove
confusion
and
the
only...
however,
there's
a
special
defense
which
you
have,
which
turns
out
to
be
there's
no
confusion,
that's
not
a
special
defense.
justice
antonin
scalia
makes
it
a
meaningless
statute,
really.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
question
presented
here.
i
mean,
we
could
agree
with
that,
that
it's
relevant
to
deciding
the
defense,
and
still
answer
the
question
presented
the
way
that
the
petitioner
wants.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
might
have
been
afraid
that
you'd
sue
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
forget
your
position,
if
you've
taken
it,
do
you
agree
that
the
degree
of
confusion
that
is
predictable
or
that
is
likely
is
one
of
the
elements
that
can
be
used
to
determine
whether
the
use
is
a
fair
one?
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
that's
all
i
wanted
to
know.
