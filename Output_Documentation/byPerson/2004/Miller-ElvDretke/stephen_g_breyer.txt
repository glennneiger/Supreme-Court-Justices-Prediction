justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now...
now,
as
i
understand
it,
this
case
was
here
before.
we
all
read
this
and
we
went
through
it,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
i...
if
i
read
the
opinion...
not
the
dissent,
but
the
majority
opinion...
and
it
might
be
in
my
interest
if
people
followed
dissents
more,
but
i
think
the
law
is
we
follow
the
majority
opinion.
so
when
i
read
the
majority
opinion,
i
read,
number
one,
there
was
history
in
this
county,
at
least
7
years
earlier
though,
where
they
actually
had
a
booklet
which
said
let's
keep
all
the
african
americans
out,
here's
how
you
do
it.
then
you
had
jury
shuffling,
which
were
two
instances.
in
one
of
them,
there
are
like
40
people.
in
my
mind,
you
know,
we
have
rows.
in
row
1
there
are
four
black
jurors
and
six
white;
row
2,
three
black
and
seven
white;
row
3,
two
black
and
in
the
last
row
one
black,
and
the
prosecution
says,
hey,
let's
shuffle
it.
all
right?
and
the
other
time
he
did
it,
the
only
other
time...
it
wasn't
quite
that
bad...
the
same
idea.
then
the
third
thing
that
comes
up
is
you
find
instances
here...
not
everyone,
absolutely
right...
but
instances
where
black
people
who
seemed
really
for
the
death
penalty,
say,
like
mr.
fields
manages
to
get
knocked
off,
but
mrs.
mazza
who
seems
quite
uncertain
is
kept
on.
and
then
we
have
this
disparate
questioning
that
you're
about
to
mention
where
it
just
turns
out
that
almost
every
black
is
given
this
really...
you
know,
bring
them
in
a
gurney,
put...
put...
you
know,
real
graphic
description
of
the
death
penalty,
and
white
people
who
also
expressed
hesitation
aren't.
okay?
so
on
the
basis
of
that,
the
majority
writes
there
is,
indeed,
a
strong
suspicion
here
that
this
was
discrimination.
so
i
want
to
ask
you...
and
if
i
were
to
write
something
like
that...
i
didn't
write
the
words,
but
i
would
mean,
well,
i
think
that's
what
it
is
unless
there's
something
later
on
that
comes
out
to
the
contrary.
so
i'm
asking
you
what
was
to
the
contrary.
what
came
out
in
this
fifth
circuit
that
we
didn't
have
in
front
of
us
the
last
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that
was
the
issue,
but
i'm
saying
if
i
read
the
opinion
to
say...
now,
maybe
you'll
tell
me
i
shouldn't.
we
should
just
go
back
and
redo
what
we
did.
but
i'm
reading
the
opinion
to
say,
well,
unless
something
changes
here,
this
is
bad.
it's
discriminatory.
now,
you
can
tell
me,
one,
i'm
wrong
to
read
the
opinion
that
way.
i
got
that
argument.
but
i
want
to
be
sure
that
that's
what's
in
front
of
me.
so
i
want
to
know
is
there
something
different
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
wasn't
here
the
first
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
that's
why
i
asked.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
must
be
a
different
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
that
wasn't
the
one
i
asked.
the
one
i
wanted
answered
was
the
question
of
i
understand
that
point,
which
we
could
say
it
was
definitely
not
definite
the
last
time.
i'm
asking
you...
it's
a
serious
question...
as
whether
there
was
something
new
or
different
that
came
up
when
the
fifth
circuit
wrote
this.
now,
i
gathered
from
your
answer,
it
might
be
yes,
and
if
the
answer
is
yes,
i
want
you
to
say
what
it
is
because
i'm
interested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
don't
know...
if
you
don't
know,
you...
there's
an
excellent
way
to
know.
somebody
says,
you
know,
mr.
prosecutor,
you
gave
this
terribly
graphic
script
to
all
the
black
people
and
you
really
didn't
give
it
to
hardly
any
of
the
white
people.
now,
it's
also
possible...
possible...
that
the
reason
he
didn't
was
because
from
the
answer
to
their
questionnaires,
which
we've
not
seen,
you
didn't
need
to.
that's
possible.
but
if
that
were
the
case,
wouldn't
he
have
said
to
the
judge,
judge,
that's
why
i
did
it.
i
didn't
ask
them
because
i
read
the
questionnaires.
wouldn't
that
be
what
you
would
do
or
any
prosecutor
would
do
if
that
were
the
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
did
the
prosecutor
ever
do
that
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
the
prosecutor
not...
was
he
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
and
did...
was
anyone
there
who
had
ever
talked
to
the
prosecutors?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
could
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
couldn't
you
have
asked
the
prosecutors
if
that
was
the
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
i
mean,
what
you've
done
is
say...
of
course,
i
could
think
of
reasons
that
could
have
been
their
reason,
but
unless
there's
some
reason
for
thinking
that
was
their
reason--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
think
they're
based,
for
example,
on
capital
punishment.
but
now,
let
me
give
you
two
of
them,
and
this
is
why...
this
is
actually
why
i
get
somewhat
concerned
about
this.
here
is
the
answer
of
the
white
woman
who
served
on
the
jury
about
capital
punishment.
could
you
put
miller-el
to
death?
mrs.
mazza:
it's
difficult.
i've
had
2
days
to
think
about
it,
and
given
my
religious
upbringing,
et
cetera,
going
on
for
a
few
sentences,
i
think
i
could.
she
serves
on
the
jury.
okay?
here's
mr.
fields
who
is
black
and
whom
they
got
off.
what
i
think,
according
to
the
old
testament,
people
were
killed
if
they
violated
his
law.
in
its
extended
service,
the
state
represents
him.
i
feel
the
state
is
god's
extended
person.
in
other
words,
the
state
represents
god
in
today's
time.
therefore,
if
the
state
exacts
death,
that's
what
it
should
be.
that's
the
man
they
feel
has
the
qualm,
and
the
woman
i
told
you
who
was
white
they
feel
has
no
qualm.
now,
i
look
at
that,
and
i
say,
you
know,
i
mean,
my
goodness,
it's
pretty
hard
to
see
how
you
get
yourself
in
that
frame
of
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
know.
they
then
said
that
oh,
you
see,
mr.
fields
was...
is
it
a
woman
or
a
man?
i'm
not
sure.
yes,
he's
a
man
i
think.
he...
he's
kept
off,
the
black
man,
because
of
his
views
on
rehabilitation.
so
i
looked
up
what
those
views
were,
and
that
consists
of
his
saying...
my...
my
interpretation...
well,
i
think
any
person,
if
he
really
believes
in
god,
really
believes
in
god,
could
be
rehabilitated.
at
which
point
the
prosecutor
says
to
him,
well,
suppose
you
came
to
the
conclusion
that
miller-el
really
was
touched
by
god,
could
you
put
him
to
death?
answer:
yes.
why?
because,
well,
it
seems
to
me
my
job
here
is
to
follow
the
law.
that's
the
man
whom
they
think
they
are...
they
are
kicking
off
because
of
his
views
of
possibly
not
applying
the
death
penalty,
and
the
other
woman,
who
is
white,
they
keep
on.
now,
i
think
that's
the
whole
story
there.
there
was
also
the
brother
who
was
a
drug...
who
was
the
drug...
you
know,
he
had
had
drug
convictions,
but
that's
scarcely
mentioned.
so...
so
i
look
at
those
two
people
and
i
think,
gee,
put
that
in
context.
my
goodness.
what...
what's
your
response
to
that?
