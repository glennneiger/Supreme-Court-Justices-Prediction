justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waxman,
we
really
have
to
examine
your...
you
know,
your
allegations,
i
suppose,
one
at
a
time.
it
makes
it
a
very
complicated
case.
the...
the
state's
response
to...
to
your
argument
that
two
of...
of
the
state's
attorneys
involved
in
this
case
had
been
found
to
have
made
racially
based
strikes
in
the
past...
the
state's
response
to
that
is
that
that
was
not
part
of
the
evidence
presented
in
state
court,
and
therefore,
it...
it
is
not
a
proper
consideration
in
reviewing
the
state
court
decision.
what...
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
my.
you
mean
anything
out
there
that...
that
a
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
can
be...
can
be
charged
to
the
court?
my
goodness,
no.
i
think
it
was
the
burden
of
the...
of
the
defendant
challenging
the...
the
strikes
to
bring...
bring
that
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
my
goodness.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
the
problem.
we've
got
to
go
through
each
one
of
them
one
by
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
i'm...
you
know,
i
don't
remember
the
names
of
people
involved
in...
in
prior
cases
in
this
court.
i...
i...
you
know,
if
we
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
had
this
same
officer
before
you,
my
goodness,
i...
i
wouldn't
remember
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
their
response--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
respondent's
reply
to
this...
this
minimal
punishment
argument
is
that
in
fact
the...
the
two
white
prospective
jurors
who
had...
who
had
expressed
antagonism
towards
the
death
penalty
were
subjected
to
the
same
questioning,
and
that
the
seven
out
of
eight
black
prospective
were
seven
who
had
expressed
antagonism
to
the
death
penalty.
now,
is
that
not
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
have
to
go
through
each
one
of
them
and
see
if
the
degree
of
hostility
expressed
by
the
white
jurors
was
the
same
as
the
degree
of
hostility
expressed
by
the
black
jurors.
and
in
fact,
the
degree
of
hostility
by
the
black
jurors
was
quite
high.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
said
i
really
don't
believe
in
it.
i
support
it
only
in
extreme
cases,
such
as
those
involving
mass
killings
or
mutilation.
and
another
one...
another
one
said,
well,
right
now
maybe
i
do,
but
who
knows
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if...
if
there
happens
to
be
a
different
attitude
towards
the
death
penalty
among
the
black
jurors
than
there
is
among
the
white
jurors,
you
cannot
fault
the...
the
attorneys
for...
for
striking
more
of
the
black
jurors.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
wait.
he
also
said...
when
asked
whether
he
could
vote
to
impose
the
death
penalty,
he
said,
right
now
i
say
i
can,
but
tomorrow
i
might
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that's
a
strong--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
have
to
deal
with
each
of
the
six
one
by
one,
and...
and
they
have
arguments
with
respect
to
each
of
them.
i
don't
care
what
rand
said.
those
things
that
you
said
sounded
very
good.
but
if
he
finishes
it
off
by
saying,
right
now
i
say
that,
but
tomorrow
i
might
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
doesn't
strike
me...
and
that...
that's
what
respondent
says
rand
said,
not...
not
one
of
the
other
ones.
and
you
have
to
go
down
each
of
the
other
six,
and
they
have
a
response
for
each
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
and...
and,
you
know,
a
buckshot
attack
on
it
has
to
be
examined
pellet
by
pellet.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
those
things
are
okay,
right,
except
the
race
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
maybe
their
right
about
beards
and
mustaches.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know.
if
they're
right,
good
for
them.
right?
you...
you...
they
ought
to
strike
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
only
speak
to
the
issues
before
us,
don't
we?
and
the
issue
before
us
last
time
was
not
the
issue
before
us
here.
it
was
simply
whether
there
was
enough
evidence
to
require
the
issuance
of
a
coa.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
a
good
deal
different.
whatever
the
majority
might
have
said
about
other
issues,
it
certainly
was
not
binding
on
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
on
the
basis
of
the
questionnaires
expressing
hostility
to
the
death
penalty
that
more
intensive
questioning
was
given
to
some
people
than
to
others,
and
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
larger
number
of
those
people
was
black
is
not
a
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
hypothetical,
assuming
that
you...
you
just
have
blacks
and
whites
with
no
difference
in...
in
what
they...
in
what
they
had
said
on
the
questionnaire,
is
a
hypothetical
that
you
say
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
prosecutors
didn't
want
to
come
up
with
an
all-white
jury
for
fear
it
would
be
challenged.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it...
is
it
unlawful
to
take
sex
into
account
in
jury
selection?
