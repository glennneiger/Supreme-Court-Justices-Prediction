justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
big
picture.
the
majority
of
african
americans
summoned
for
jury
duty
in
this
case
were
either
opposed
to
the
death
penalty
generally
or
unwilling
to
impose
it,
while
the
majority
of
white
jurors
had
no
qualms
about
the
death
penalty.
striking
prospective
jurors
based
on
their
case-related
views
which,
after
the
fact,
correlate
with
race
is
not
unconstitutional.
essentially,
though
miller-el
has
presented
this
case
as
one
of
disparate
treatment,
it
is
actually
one
of
disparate
impact.
i
will
discuss
first--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
and
the
record
in
this
case
actually
does
not
support
that
that...
does
not
support
a
proposition
that
black
jurors
were
questioned
differently.
most
significantly,
the
minimum...
the
questioning
on
the
graphic
script.
of
the
six
challenged
jurors
in
this
case,
only
two
received
the
graphic...
graphic
script
at
the
outset
of
their
voir
dire,
carrol
boggess
and...
and
wayman
kennedy,
both
of
whom
had
answered
the
questions
in
their
juror
questionnaire
indicating
ambiguity
regarding
their
views
on
the
death
penalty
regarding
their
support
for
the
death
penalty.
this
fact--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--your
honor,
the
first
time
before
this
court,
the
issue
was
whether,
based
on
a
threshold
examination
of
the
record--
ms.
gena

bunn
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
most...
the
most
important
difference
in
the
review
of
this
court
the
last
time
and
the
review
of
this...
of
the
court
this
time
is
that
the
court
did
take
a
big-picture
look
at
all
of
the
pieces
of
evidence,
but
at
this
point,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
as
this...
as
this
court
must
do
now,
it
must
go,
as
justice
scalia
mentioned,
juror
by
juror,
the
jurors
who
were
challenged.
miller-el--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--that
is
correct.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
no,
your
honor.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
yes,
your
honor,
there
was
additional
analysis,
particularly
of
the
six
jurors
miller-el
claims
were
discriminated
against,
which
this
court
did
not
review
the
first...
in
its
first
opinion
specifically.
and
a
review
of
miller-el's
purposeful
discrimination
claim
must
focus
on
these
six
jurors.
and
given
the...
the
views
expressed
by
these
six
veniremen,
it
is
no
surprise
that
prosecutors
struck
them.
each
venire
member
peremptorily
struck
by
the
state
had
voiced
views
unfavorable
to
the
state
but
were
not
subject
to
a
challenge
for
cause.
these
reasons
are
race-neutral,
case-related,
and
supported
by
the
record,
in
fact,
supported
by
the
very
words
that
the
jurors
uttered.
carrol

indicated
that
her
beliefs...
on
the
questionnaire

her
beliefs

ability

regarding

that
is
not
the
case
here,
however,
where

the
disparate
questioning
on
minimum
sentencing,
for
instance,
was
based
on
the
views
that
were
expressed.

--there...
there
was
evidence
in
the
swain
hearing,
and
that...
in
fact,
the
cross
examination
by
the
prosecutors
did
indicate
that
practices
that
were
in
the
past
had
been...
had
been
vitiated,
at
least
closer
to
the
time
of

but
regardless
of
that--
ms.

the

assuming

that...

instance,
with
the

of

script
questioning,
the...
of
the
six...
again,
of
the
six
challenged
jurors,
four
did
not
receive
the
graphic
script
at
the
outset
of
voir
dire.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
your
honor--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--the
record
shows
that
of
5
weeks
of
voir
dire,
the
state
requested
shuffles
three
times.
two
of
those
times,
the
defense
counsel
put
on
the
record
that
there
were
a
greater
number
of
african
american
jurors
in
the
front
of
the
panel.
they--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--your

there
was
no
response
from
the
prosecutors.
there
was
no
objection
made,
no
specific
objection
made
as
to...
as
to
the
state's
exercise
of
a
jury
shuffle.
but
in
this
case
to
ask
this...
what...
what
miller-el
is
asking
this
court
is
to
assume
that
the
only
discernible
trait
that
could
have
been
the
basis
for
the
state's
exercise
of
a
jury
shuffle
is
race,
and
that
is
not...
that
is
not
the
case.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
your
honor,
again,
miller-el's
claim
of
purposeful
discrimination
must
focus
on
these
six
jurors,
and
in
answer
to
your
question,
a
review
of
these
six
jurors
does
show
that
these
strikes
were
not
based
on
race.
this
was
not
the
tipping--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--your
honor,
the...
that
was
not
the
prosecutor's
argument
at
trial
and
it's...
it
is
not
our
position
now
that--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--your
honor,
as
to
juror
billy
jean
fields,
he
did
not
express
qualms
about
the
death
penalty
in
general,
but
he
did
state
that
it
was
his
belief
that
no
one...
no
one...
no
matter
their
background
or
what
they've
done,
is
beyond
rehabilitation.
everyone
can
be
rehabilitated.
and
this
was
a
view
regarding
rehabilitation
that
no
one,
white
or
black,
had
expressed.
it
was
a
unique
view,
and
in
this
case
where
jurors
are
asked
to...
to...
the
question,
is
this
person
going
to
be
a
continuing
threat
to
society,
is...
is
something
that's
going
to
go
into
their
punishment
inquiry.
and
if
this
person
is
one
who
the
prosecutor
believed
could
tend...
if
there's
a
repentant
criminal
defendant
on
the
stand
who
testifies,
that
they
would
tend
to
believe
that
person
and
answer
the
question
no.
and...
and
again,
this
was
not
the
only
basis
for
the
state's
strike
as
well.
the
fact
that
his
brother
had
been
prosecuted
in
dallas
county
numerous
times,
the
same
prosecuting
authority,
contemporaneous
with
the
trial,
numerous
occasions,
had
served
time,
and
contrary
to
miller-el's
assertions,
the
state
did
question
mr.
fields
on
this
issue
during
voir
dire,
and
it
was
a
basis
for
the
strike.
there--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--i...
i

i
don't

any

there's
no
information
on...
in
the

about
exercising
it
in
other
cases,
and
i
just...
i
just
don't
know.
but
the
first
part
of
the
question,
there
could...
as
mr.
waxman
mentioned,
there...
there
were
other
visual
cues
noted
on
the
cards.
attorneys,
especially--
ms.

--not
necessarily.
i
mean,
there
were
other...
there
was
other--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--there
was...
just
to
familiarize
an
attorney
getting
ready
for

of
an
extensive
number
of
people--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--that's
certainly--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--no,
your
honor.
the
fact
that
it
was
noted
on
the
race...
on
the...
on
the
juror
card
does...
does
not
necessarily
indicate
that.
again,
it
could
be
a
cue
for
a...
a
litigant
preparing
for
voir
dire.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
there
were
some
that
could...
that
would
correlate,
but
there
were
others
that
aren't
noted
on
the
juror
cards--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--the...
for
instance,
occupations
were...
or

perhaps
not

but
i
know
addresses

were
noted.
there
could
have
been
other
things
at
that
point
that
were
not
noted.
there
was
a

information
available
at
that
point,
whether
visual
or
from
the
juror
information
cards.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--the
record
indicates
that
prosecutor
macaluso
was
involved
in
jury
selection
in
the

case,
and

case

i
believe
it
was
late
1985
when

was
tried.
ms.
gena

this
was

ms.
gena

bunn
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
that's
certainly
not
alleged
in
this
case.
the
jury
actually
consisted
of
seven
women.
but
again,
to...
the...
the
race-coding
issue...
as
far
as
whether
it's
exercised
now,
i
mean,
i
wouldn't
be
particularly
surprised
if
it
were.
a
conscientious
litigant...
it's
really
necessary
to
keep
track
of
the
race
of
prospective
jurors,
as
justice
scalia
noted,
to
be
certain
that
you
don't
run
afoul
of
batson.
but--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--that...
that
doesn't--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--yes,
that's
true.
i
was
referring
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
the...
the
practice,
whether
it
continues.
but
again,
regarding
its
use
in
this
case,
i
would...
i
would
say
that
it...
it's
not...
does
not
necessarily
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
noted
basically
to
treat
african
american
venire
members
differently
because
the
record
actually--
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
--your
honor,
the...
the
notations,
though,
correlate
as
well
to
simply
visual
cues
that
a
litigant
will
use
just
simply
to
familiarize
himself
with
the
manual.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
your
honor,
there
are
other
explainable
reasons,
there
are
other
plausible
reasons
for
noting
those
things.
but
even
that
aside,
again,
we
must
look
at
these
six
jurors
and
they
all
expressed
views
unfavorable
to
the
state.
and
miller-el
has
failed
to
identify
a
similarly
situated
white
juror.
ms.
gena
a.
bunn
justice
ginsburg,
they
recognized,
as
justice
scalia
had
in
his
concurring
opinion,
that
that
was
basically
as
close
as
it
got.
but
at
most,
mazza
acknowledged
that
the
decision
whether
to
impose
a
death
sentence
would
be
difficult,
not
an
easy
one,
kind
of
hard,
but
she
simultaneously
stated
that
it
was
a
decision
that
she
believed
that
she
could
make.
she
never
questioned
her
ability
to
assess
a
death
sentence
in
an
appropriate
case.
she
merely
acknowledged
that
it
was
a
decision
that
she
would
not
take
lightly.
she
also
had
served
on
another
criminal
jury
in
the
last
couple
of
years,
a
jury
which
had
returned
a
guilty
verdict.
in
contrast,
rand
explicitly
questioned
his
ability
to
assess
a
death
sentence
in
any
case.
when
asked
whether
he
could
impose
the
death
penalty,
he
told
prosecutors
right
now
i
say
i
can,
but
tomorrow
i
might
not.
he
declined
to
describe
himself
as
someone
who
believes
in
the
death
penalty
and
can
serve
as
a
jury...
juror
and
assess
the
death
penalty
if
warranted,
stating
that
he
was
probably
in
between
the
first
two
categories
described
by
the
prosecutor.
notably,
mr.
waxman
referred
to
the
prosecutors'
notes
on
the
questionnaires.
what
he
didn't
mention
was
also
noted
on
the...
by
the
state
at...
at
the
joint
lodging,
page
30,
is
that
juror
rand
had
referred
to
the
death
penalty
as
a
touchy
subject
and
that
he
had
described
himself
as
a
person
falling
somewhere
in
between
the
two
categories
described
by
the
prosecutor,
the
first
being
someone
who
believes
in
the
death
penalty
and
can
assess
it,
the
second
being
someone
who
believes
in
the
death
penalty
generally
but
cannot
personally
assess
it
as
a
juror.
so
the
state
did
take
note
of
the...
of
the
expressions
of
ambivalence
by
rand
during
his
voir
dire.
juror
mazza,
again,
never
expressed
this
level
of
ambivalence.
these
are
not
similarly
situated
jurors.
and
the
same
is
true
of
miller-el's
attempted
comparison
of
rand
and...
and
juror
sandra
hearn.
she
expressed
hesitance
on
assessing
the
death
penalty
in
a
very
particular
circumstance,
the...
a
first
offense,
and
certainly
this
is
not
the
case
here.
on
the
other
hand,
rand
had
questioned
his
ability
to
assess
a
death
penalty
in
any
case
and,
against
hearn's
state-friendly
views,
led
to
a
defense
challenge
that
was
overruled.
and
the
fact
that
the
defense
vehemently
objected
to
her
on
direct
appeal
is
further
evidence
that
she's
not
similarly
situated.
under
batson,
miller-el
has
the
ultimate
burden
of
proving
purposeful
discrimination.
he
has
failed
to
satisfy
that
burden,
and
the
state
trial
judge
found
that
prosecutors
in
this
case
did
not
act
with
a
discriminatory
purpose.
as
this
court
acknowledged
in
its
earlier
opinion,
miller-el
is
not
entitled

habeas
relief
unless
he
can...

the
state
court's
rejection
of
his
batson
claim
was
objectively
unreasonable.
he
must
produce
clear
and
convincing
evidence
and
he
has
failed
to
do
that.
