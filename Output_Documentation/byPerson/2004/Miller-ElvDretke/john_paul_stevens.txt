paul

we'll
hear
argument
now
in
the
case
of
miller-el
against
dretke.
mr.
waxman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
on
the
minimum
punishment
ploy?
did
that
ever
work
in
this
case
or
did
any
of...
of
the
trial
judges
ever
grant
a...
a
challenge
for
cause
on
the
basis
of
the
use
of
the
minimum
punishment
ploy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you...
you
haven't
really
answered
my
question
yet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
any...
did
any
texas
trial
judge,
to
your
knowledge,
ever
fall
for
this
ploy,
ever
grant
a...
a
challenge
for
cause
based
on
answers
to
the
minimum
punishment
harangue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
see
any
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
by
all
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
bunn.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
hate
to
say
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
my
colleagues,
but
i'm
very
much
interested
in
hearing
what
ms.
bunn
has
to
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this?
there
are
two
questions
just
generally.
one,
i'm
curious
about
the
answer
to
my
question
to...
to
mr.
waxman.
did
the
minimum
punishment
ploy
ever
work?
did
it
ever
succeed
in
getting
a
challenge
for
cause
granted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
have...
and
the
challenges
were
granted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
none
of
them
were
granted
in
this
case.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it...
it
was
true
that
this
was...
was
a
ploy
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
make
it
unnecessary
to
use
a...
a
peremptory
challenge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
defend
that
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you...
if
you
can
get
the
venire
person
to
make
a
mistake
in
his
answer,
then
you...
you
get...
get
him
off
easy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
don't
know
what
the
questionnaire
showed
as
to
most
of
the
white
venire
persons,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
many
white
venire
persons
were
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
48.
and
how
many
were
given
this
questioning?
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
are
we
to
assume
that
all
46
of
the
other
white
venire
persons
were
as
tough
on
the
death
penalty
as
you'd
like
everybody
to
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
just
don't
know
about
those
other
46,
do
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
a
reasonable
inference
that
some
of
them
might
have
expressed
doubt
about
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
a
fair
inference
that
each
of
the
cues
noted
on
the
cards
was
something
that
the
prosecutors
thought
relevant
to
whether
or
not
to
challenge
the
juror?
and
if
so,
is
it
not...
does...
is
that
not
uncontradicted
evidence
that
the
race
of
the
venire
person
was
a
factor
in
the
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
else
would
it
be
noted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
may
be,
but
is
it
not...
is
it
not
clear
that
this
is
one
of
the
factors
that
was
used
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
exercise
a
challenge,
just
as
the
beard
and
the
other
things
that
are
mentioned
in
the...
in
the
manual
were?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
batson
hadn't
been
decided
yet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms....
ms.
bunn.
mr.
waxman,
you
have
about
3
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
case
is
submitted.
