justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the...
and
the
fifth
circuit's
answer
to
the
jury
shuffle
was,
well,
the
defense
shuffled
more
times,
as
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
i
recall.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
the
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
you
were
dealing
with
fields,
and
the
answer
in
fields'
case
that
the
prosecution
gives
is
he
had
a
strong
feeling
about
rehabilitation,
and
so
he
was...
he
thought
that
everyone
could
rehabilitated...
rehabilitated.
so
that
shows
he...
he
wasn't
like
others
who
didn't
entertain
those
doubts
about
rehabilitation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
bunn,
before
you
finish,
there...
there
are
two
pieces
of
this
i
hope
you
can
give
me
an
answer
to.
the
race-coding.
is
there
any
neutral
reason
for
that?
and
when
was
that
stopped,
if
it
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
had
asked
you
if
they
were
still
race
and
gender-coded.
you
hadn't
gotten
to
that
part
of
the
question.
these
cards
were
race-coded
and
for
other
things
too.
right
now
in
the
state,
do
the
prosecutors
code
cards...
cards
for
race
and
gender?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
other
question
i
had,
are
these
two
prosecutors
the
same
ones
who
were
involved
in
other
cases
where
it
was
determined
that
they
had
used
tactics
that
violated
batson?
were
those
cases
contemporaneous
with
miller-el's
or
were
they
earlier
in
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
comparing
rand's
testimony...
that
that
was
in
line
with
mazza's.
the
fifth
circuit
seems
to
recognize
that
those
two
were
closely
comparable.
