mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
hernandez
v.
new
york,
this
court
explained
that
there
are
exceptional
cases
in
which
the
totality
of
evidence
surrounding
jury
selection
is
so
strong
that
a
finding
of
no
discrimination
is
simply
too
incredible
to
be
accepted
by
this
court.
this
is
that
exceptional
case,
a
case
in
which
even
on
collateral
review,
the
sheer
weight
of
the
mutually
reinforcing
evidence
renders
objectively
unreasonable
the
state
court's
conclusion
that
race
did
not
motivate
even
one
of
the
prosecution's
peremptory
strikes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
believe
so.
you
have
to
find,
justice
o'connor,
that
race
was
the
but-for
factor
or
the
tipping
factor,
not
the
only
factor,
but
the
but-for
factor
for
at
least
one
to
come
within
the
four
corners
of
batson.
now,
i
could
argue
i
think,
if
i
needed
to
in
this
case,
that
the
jury
shuffle
evidence
alone,
which
is
an
unexplained,
blatantly
race-based
means
of
racially
excluding
jurors
from
the
venire,
comes
within
batson,
the
batson
proscription
itself,
or
i
could
argue
that
case
too.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
state
has
in
its
brief
in
this
case,
on
this
trip
to
the
court...
the
state
has
cited
the
court
to
one
other
case
in
which
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
acknowledged
the
state's
justification
in
that
case,
that
it
shuffled
because
there
was
a
member
of
the
probation
office
in
the
front
row
that
they
didn't
want
to
embarrass
and
that
jurors
in
the
front
had
tended
more
to
have
ties
than
jurors
in
the
back.
that
is...
that
was
never
claimed
in
this
case.
we
have,
from
the
very--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you
know,
i
can't...
the
case
is
called
ladd
v.
state.
there
is...
there's
some...
now
some
reasonably
substantial
law
review
commentary
in
the
state
of
texas.
i
cited
the
court
to...
to
one
in
the
houston
law
review
or
the
houston
bar
review
when
i
was
here
last
time,
and
there
has
since
been
one
in
the
st.
mary's
law
review
that
says
this
is
a
procedure
that
is
used
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
visual
preference.
and
what's
particularly
interesting
about
it
in
this
case
is
there
was
a
contemporaneous
objection
in
week
2
and
week
3
and
week
4
that
the
state
was
doing
this
based
on
race,
and
the
state
offered
no
defense
at
the
time.
it
offered
no
defense
in
the
subsequent
batson
hearing.
it
had
no
explanation
before
the
magistrate,
the
district
judge,
the
fifth
circuit,
in
this
court
or
below,
and
now
in
this
court
this
time
it
says,
well,
there's
this
other
case
in
which
the
reason
given
was
that
we
didn't
want
to
embarrass
the
probation
officer
and
we
didn't...
and
we
had
people
who
had
ties
in
the
front
row.
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
record
that
would
justify
those
excuses
here.
and
the
evidence
in
the...
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
that
seems
to
me
compels
the
conclusion
that
this
was
done
for
the
deliberate
purpose
of
minimizing
the
number
of
african
americans
on
the
jury.
and
it
was
done
by
prosecutors,
each
of
whom...
there
were
two
prosecutors
in
this
case,
each
of
whom
was
found
to
have
violated
batson
in
criminal...
other
criminal
trials
contemporaneous
with
this
one.
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
fifth--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the...
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
we...
that
they
shuffled
twice
and
we
shuffled
five
times.
now,
that
is
both
factually
wrong
and
legally
irrelevant.
they
shuffled
three
times
and
they
tried
to
shuffle
a
four
times...
a
fourth
time
because,
the
court
will
perhaps
recall...
this
was
discussed
in
the
court's
last
opinion...
because
they
waived
in
the
fourth
week.
the
defense
shuffled...
the
defense
then
shuffled
and
they
tried
to
come
in
and
back...
back
and
shuffle
again
when
a
number
of
african
americans
were
advanced
in
the
order.
there...
under
this
court's
batson
jurisprudence,
the
proscription
against
using
peremptory
strikes
for
a
racial
purpose
or
a
gender-based
purpose
is
proscribed
to
the
defense,
as
well
as
the
prosecution,
but
there...
the
one
doesn't
excuse
the
other,
and
there
has
never
been
a
claim,
nor
is
there
a
factual
predicate
laid
in
this
case
for
a
claim,
that
mr.
miller-el's
trial
lawyers
were
doing
the
same.
even
if
it
were
true,
it
would
not
justify
what
they
did.
now--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
it
was
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think,
if
i
needed
to...
i
mean,
we...
we've
argued
that
the
shuffle,
just
like
the
race
coding
of
the
cards
in
the
pre-batson
era,
the
disparate
questioning
on
minimum
punishment
and
the
graphic
script,
all
reinforce
what
we
think
the
record
shows
with
respect
to
each
of
the
six
peremptory
strikes
that
we
challenge--
but
if
we
didn't
have
that,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
be
here
arguing
that
if
i
could
show
a
single
strike
that
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
african
americans
from
being
considered
for
jury
service,
that
that
ought
to
come
within
this
court's
proscription
of
batson.
now,
we
haven't
made
that
freestanding
claim
because
i
don't
think
we
need
that
freestanding
claim.
the
jury
shuffle
is
a
practice
that
exists
only
in
the
state
of
texas
and,
to
my
understanding,
has
ever
existed
only
in
the
state
of
texas.
so
it's
a...
it's
a
very
peculiar
phenomenon,
but
i
think
i
could
make
the
argument
that,
look,
even
if
there
weren't
any
of
these
six...
let's
say
they
shuffled
it
so
successfully
that
no
african
americans
came
up.
there
simply
were
no
african
americans
out
of
the
108
who
were
questioned.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
in
and
of
itself
would
violate
at
least
a
generous
reading
of
batson.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
that's
wrong.
i
think
it's
wrong,
first
of
all,
because
those
two
cases
had
been
decided
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
at
the
time
it
considered
the
batson
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
i
am
not
sure.
i
don't
have
the...
neither
the
transcript
nor
the
briefs
are
available
for
that
argument.
but
it's...
the
court...
they
are
judicial
decisions
of
that
court.
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
them
and
they
are
evidence.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
even...
i
understand
your
argument.
i
can't
tell
you
for
sure...
and
i
don't
believe
anybody
can...
whether
those
cases
were
or
weren't
argued
before
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
because
my
understanding
is...
i
don't...
i
have
not
seen
the
briefs
that
were
filed
in
the
batson
appeal,
and
i
don't
have
the
transcript
of
the
argument.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
the...
the
very
same
court.
and
in
any
event--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--macaluso.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
he
certainly
was.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
that
was
mr.
kinne
had
the
chickenpox,
so
the
jury
was...
the...
the
voir
dire
took
place.
mr.
macaluso
and
mr.
nelson
alternated
the
voir
dire
examination
in
the
case,
and
those
were
the
two
prosecutors,
mr.
macaluso
in
the
other
miller-el...
in
the
chambers
case
and
mr.
nelson
in
mrs.
miller-el's
case.
and
interestingly,
what
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
with
respect
to
mr.
macaluso
in
the
chambers
case
is
not
only
that
he
removed
five
out
of
five
african
americans
for
reasons
that
violate
batson,
but
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
also
noted
that
he
was
using
the
same
minimum
punishment
ploy
that
he
used
in
this
case
in
order
to
disqualify
african
american
jurors.
he...
the
court
actually
goes
and
says,
you
know,
with
three
of
these
people,
the
state
tried
to
disqualify
them
by
asking
them
an
open-ended
question
about
what
they
thought
the
minimum
punishment
should
be
even
though
that's
usually
what
the
defense
is
concerned
about.
precisely
what
happened
in
this
case.
now,
i'm
not
suggesting,
justice
scalia,
that
our
case
depends
upon
the...
this
404(b)
evidence
or
not,
and
i
think
it's
quite--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
a...
first
of
all,
these...
each
of
these
cases
was
tried
within
months
of
mr.
miller-el's
case,
and
a
finding
by
a...
the
state's
highest
court
that
a
prosecutor
has
engaged
in
intentional,
deliberate,
race
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
a
jury
i
respectfully
submit...
i
certainly
hope
is
not
the
kind
of
everyday
finding
that
is
easily
forgotten.
but
in
any
event,
you...
yes.
you
have
to
go
through
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case,
and
what
the
evidence
in
the
case
shows
is
that,
first
of
all,
as
this
court
observed
the
last
time
it
was
here,
the
state's
proper
race-neutral
rationales
for
striking
african
american
jurors
pertains
just
as
well
to
white
jurors
who
were
not
challenged
and
who
did
serve.
it's...
you
also
have
to
look
at
the
race-coding
of
the
cards,
race-coding
that
was
done
by
prosecutors
whom
this
court
observed
last
time
were
trained
in
an
office
culture
suffused
with
bias
against
african
americans
in
jury
selection.
and
you
also
have
to
look
at,
with
respect,
the
remarkable
disparity
in
the
way
in
which
african
american
and
white
venire
members
were
questioned,
both
with
respect
to
minimum
punishment--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
with
respect
to
the
graphic
script.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
can't
speak
to
other
cases.
but
what's
truly
remarkable
about
this
case...
i
mean,
there
are
many
things
that
are
truly
remarkable
about
this
case...
the
state
not
only
used
this
minimum
punishment
ploy
with
90...
7
out
of
8
of
the
african
americans,
as
opposed
to
only
2
out
of
36
of
the
whites,
but
it
actually
tried
to
remove
2
of
the
african
americans
in
this
case:
rand
and
kennedy.
it
submitted
them
for
cause
based
on
their
answers
to
those
questions.
and
then
interestingly,
when
that
was
denied
and
the
state
had
to
justify
its...
to
provide
its
race-neutral
reasons
for
striking
them,
it
didn't
even
mention
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
i
would
defer
to
ms.
bunn
about
that
because
i
don't
know
about
other
cases,
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
what
happened
in
this
case
was
there
was
an
effort
to
rehabilitate.
the
trial
judge
actually
became
quite
energetic
in
trying
to
explain
to
the
juror
that,
well,
it's
5
years
and
you're
not
saying
that
you
couldn't
possibly
consider
5
years.
but...
and
that
was
true
with
respect
to
white
jurors
as
well
as
african
american
jurors.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
that
if
i...
i
believe
that
with
respect
to
minimum
punishment,
as
opposed
to
the
graphic
script,
what
the
state
is
saying
is
last
time
we
said
there
were
10
whites
and
10
blacks
who
expressed
hesitation.
and
this
court
observed
that,
well,
yes,
but
only
two
of
the
whites
got
it.
now,
they
filed
a
brief
that
says,
well,
the
other
eight
were
all
either
struck
for
cause
or
by
consent.
now,
that's...
that
fails
for
at
least
two
reasons.
one,
they
identified
10.
in
this
court
and
below,
we
identified
19
jurors
who
absolutely
expressed
hesitation
about
the
death
penalty,
and
they
have
still
not
accounted
for
them.
number
one.
number
two,
with
respect
to
the
eight
who
they
have
accounted
for
in
their
brief,
the
fact
that
at
the
very
end
of
voir
dire,
they
were
struck
for
cause,
or
there
was
an
agreement
at
the
end
of
voir
dire
to
remove
them
hardly
provides
a
reason
not
to
give
the
minimum
punishment
ploy
to
jurors
who
fit
the
categorization
that
the
state
has
described.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
in
the
context
of
all
of
this
other
evidence,
which
is
the
context
in
which
you
need
to
weigh
it
and
determine
whether
we
have
satisfied
the
stringent
standard
for
review
that
applies,
i
respectfully
submit
that
if
you
go
through
the...
the
voir
dire
questioning
of
mr.
fields
and
mr.
warren
and
mr.
rand
and
the
others
that
we've
mentioned,
and
compare
it,
even
leaving
aside
all
of
the
other
evidence,
contemporaneous
evidence,
of
race
discrimination
in
the
jury
selection
in
this
case,
i
think
you
will
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
race
was
a
but-for
factor
in
these
cases.
in
mr.
fields...
we've...
we've
mentioned
him
in
our...
we've
described
him
at
length
in
our
brief.
this
is
a
man
whom...
i
mean,

the...

on
its
questionnaire
at
the
time,
on
page

of
the
joint

wrote,

mr.
rand,
who
we've

scalia,

last

it's
a
burden
we
can
overcome
here
not
only
because
of
all
of

evidence,
but
because
of
what

that
if
he
were

he
would

--i'm...
i'm
not
sure
whether
that's
rand

i'm
saying
that
if
you
compare

thought
that

death
penalty
might
be
applicable
for

repeatedly...
in

over

over
again

would

three
questions

on
the
evidence,
without
any

for
his
view
about
the
death

not

that
this
is
somebody
whom,
if
this
were
a
case
in
which
there
was
nothing
in
this...
we
were
just
before
this
court
saying
there's
rand

mazza
or
there's
rand

that's
enough
to
satisfy
our
burden,

would

up

the
problem
with
the
state's
approach
to
this
case...
and
it
was
the
problem
that...
of
the
fifth
circuit's
analysis...
is
it
is
pointillistic.
it
is
an
analysis.
it's
like
walking
up
close
to
a
seurat
painting
and
looking
at
each
dot
and
saying,
well,
it's
red,
but
that
might
not
necessarily
be
the
handbag.
yes,
you
have...
i
mean,
he
had
to
paint
with
the
dots,
but
as
a
reviewing
court,
you
need
to
step
back
and
look
at
this
and
ask
yourself,
with
respect
to,
for
example,
mr.
fields,
who
said
not
only
would
he
have
no
hesitation
about
putting
the
death
penalty
in
place,
but
he
actually
testified
that
he
thought
that
in
capital
cases,
the
state
was
god's
embodiment
on
earth.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
all
in
and
of
itself?
i
would
say
definitely
not.
i...
i
mean--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
i
would
give--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
would
give
you
a
different
answer,
justice
kennedy,
if
it's
the
jury
shuffle
because
there's
no
plausible
explanation
available
on
the
evidence
in
this
case.
if
there
is
a
plausible
explanation
for
disparate
questioning,
which
there
is
not
in
the
statistics
in
this
case,
i
wouldn't
be
arguing
that
that
in
and
of
itself,
leaving
aside
individual,
you
know,
side-by-side
juror
comparisons,
would
suffice.
but
here,
we
have,
in
addition
to
the
disparate
questioning
that
is
not
susceptible
to
a
race-neutral
explanation...
we
have
things
like
the
prosecutor's
own
notations
in
the...
in
the
questionnaires.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
justice...
justice
ginsburg.
he...
he
expressed
an
opinion
that
he
thought
that
people
could
be
rehabilitated,
not
as
strong
as
those
opinions
by
juror...
white
juror
hearn
and
white
juror
duke
who
sat.
but
in
fields'
case,
he
was
absolutely
unequivocal...
i'm...
i'm
referring
the
court
to
page
185
of
the
joint
appendix...
absolutely
unequivocal
that
the
ability
or
propensity
for
rehabilitation
would
not
affect
his
willingness
to...
to
put
in
the
death
penalty.
i
believe
in
the
dissenting
and
concurring
opinions
in
this
case
last
time
with
respect
to
mr.
fields,
it
was
pointed
out
that
he
was
a
supporter
of
the
death
penalty
who
could
put
in
the
death
penalty.
and
what's
interesting
about
fields
is
if
you
look
at
the
transcript
pages
where
the
prosecutor
justifies
the
strike,
on
page
197
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
prosecutor
says,
well,
he
was...
he...
he...
i...
he...
he
said
something
about
rehabilitation,
and
it
goes
on.
and
then
two
pages
later...
they
have
a
discussion
about
something...
a
discussion
about
which
questionnaires
will
or
won't
go
into
evidence.
two
pages
later,
mr.
nelson
comes
in
and
says,
oh,
yes,
and
he
also
had
a
brother
who
had
had
some
involvement
with
law
enforcement.
well,
to
say
that
that's
an
afterthought
is
really
saying
something.
he
wasn't
questioned
about
it,
as...
as
neither
were...
by
the
state,
as
neither
were
any
of
the
four
white
jurors
who
sat
who
had
family
members
who
had
been
arrested
or
prosecuted.
they
didn't
even
ask
these
questions.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--oh,
absolutely.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the...
the
juror
cards
are
in
the
joint
lodging
beginning
on
page
82,
and
every
single
card
lists
the
gender
and
race,
even
the
cards
as
to
jurors
that
they
never
questioned.
so
we
know
that
these
were
notations
that
were
placed
on
the
cards
by
the
prosecutors
at
the
time
the
venires
were
called.
and
the
interesting
thing
about
these
is
it's
not
just
race
and
gender,
it's
were
they
fat,
did
they
have
a
beard,
did
they
have
a
mustache.
if
you
map
up
what's
noted
on
these
cards
with
the
sparling
training
manual
that
said
don't
take
minorities,
don't
take
jews,
don't
take
women,
don't
take
fat
people...
people
who
have
mustaches
and
beards
don't
make
good
jurors.
it's...
these
prosecutors
were
not
only
trained
by
that
manual,
they
learned
their
lesson
very
well.
may--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
know
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
we're
not
here...
if
this
were
gender
or
race,
this
court
has
said
that
can't
be
the
but-for
reason.
mustaches,
overweight,
you
know,
go
with
god.
may
i...
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
have
just
three
points.
the
fifth
circuit
had
precisely
the
same
record
before
it
that
this
court
had
and
the
state
submitted
very
nearly
precisely
the
same
brief
that
it
presented
to
the
fifth
circuit
the
time
before.
disparate
questioning
on
the
minimum
punishment
ploy
was
objected
to
by
the
defense
during
the
voir
dire
and
it
was
acknowledged.
if
you
look
at
the
batson
argument,
it's
either
mr.
macaluso
or
mr.
nelson
said
some
of
the
jurors
were
questioned
disparately,
but...
and
they
gave
the
explanation
that
it
had
to
do
with
views
on
the
death
penalty.
so
it
was
before
the
state
courts.
now,
on
the
graphic
script,
which
is
the
disparate
questioning
that
ms.
bunn
has
focused
the
court's
attention
on,
the
state
now
says,
okay,
we
can't
speculate
about
what
we
don't
know
about
the
questionnaires.
let's
just
look
at
the
questionnaires
that
we
do
know
about.
justice
stevens,
it
is...
you
are
quite
right
that
that
tells
you
nothing
about
the
dozens
of
other
white
jurors
whose
questionnaires
we
don't
have,
but
we
don't
need
to
indulge
in
that
speculation
in
this
case
because
what
we
know
from
the
questionnaire
answers
that
we
have
is
that
every
black
who
expressed
anything
that
could
be
called
hesitation
on
their
juror
questionnaire,
including
just
not
filling
in
either
question...
answering
question
56
or
58,
got
it.
five
whites
who
expressed
hesitation
did
not.
that
is
juror
mazza,
juror
hearn,
juror
duke,
ms.
girard,
who
testified
that
she
didn't...
who
acknowledged
in
her
voir
dire
that
she
hadn't
filled
out
one
of
those
questions
which
got
similarly
situated
african
american
jurors
the
graphic
script,
and
juror
whaley
who...
or
venireman
whaley
who
testified
that
her
questionnaire
expressed
great
hesitation
about
the
death
penalty.
and
what
we
also
know
is
that
the
three
jurors
who
got
the
graphic
script,
troy
woods,
the
black
juror;
mr.
gutierrez,
the
hispanic
juror;
and
marie
sztybel,
the
only
jewish
juror.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
