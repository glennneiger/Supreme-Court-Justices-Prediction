were...
were
both
of
the
cases
cases
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals?
justice
david
h.
souter
decided
by
the
court...
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
don't
we
at
some
point
have
to
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
evidence
of
past
practices
become
irrelevant?
and
if
we...
if
that
is
so,
do
we
have
any
such
evidence
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
these
are
the
same
two
prosecutors
who
in
other
cases
had
been
found,
in
effect,
guilty
of...
of
racial
discrimination
and
the
same
two
prosecutors
who
were
calling
for
the
shuffle
in
these
cases.
is
it
plausible
to
think
that
there
had
been
this
change
of
heart?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
i...
i
am
assuming
it
is
relevant,
and
i
am
asking
the
question,
is
there
a
reasonable
basis
to
think
that
these
particular
individuals,
engaging
in
the
practice
that
they
demonstrably
engaged
in,
had
had
a
change
in
heart
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
why
they
engaged
in
the
shuffle
twice--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on...
on
a
record
that
shows
there
were
black
jurors
down
front
each
time
they
engaged
in
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
that
evidence
was
not
refuted.
it
was
not
denied,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
i...
i
don't
think
that's
his
argument
at
all.
he
is
not
arguing
that
there
might
not
be
other
bases
for
making
challenges
or
making
peremptory
strikes.
what
he
is
saying
is
those
challenges
exist
for
lots
and
lots
of
jurors.
and
what
in
fact
there
is
is
very
strong
circumstantial
evidence
that
what
tipped
the
prosecutors
to
make
the
peremptory
challenges
here...
what
he
was
referring
to
earlier
in
this
argument
as
the
but-for
cause
was
racial.
he's
not
saying
nothing
else
could
have
been
involved.
he
was
saying
race
tipped
it.
and
it's
the
circumstantial
evidence,
among
other
things,
that
indicates
that
race
does.
and
that's
the
reason
for
my
question.
is
there
some
reason
to
believe
that
there
had
been
a
change
of
heart
on
the
issue
of
race
so
that
his
argument
is
unsound?
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
that
true
with
respect
to
weight
and
mustaches
and
things
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
were...
they
were
making
notations
of
things
like
that,
as
i
understand
it,
and
they
didn't
have
to
worry
about
batson
there.
but
there
does
seem
to
be
a
correlation
with
the
manual.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i...
i
don't...
i
mean,
i'd
just
like
to
go
back
to
my
question.
i
don't
know
why
else?
it's
true
if...
if
all
they
noted,
if
they
had
been
prescient
and
had
said,
you
know,
swain
is
going
to
give
way
to
batson
and
we're
going
to
note
batson
issues,
you'd
have
an
argument.
but
they
were
noting
a
lot
of
non-batson
issues
too,
and
the
one
common
characteristic
of
the
batson
issues
and
the
non-batson
issues
were
they
were
all
correlated
to
a
manual
that
says
keep
these
people
off
the
jury.
and...
and
isn't
that
a
sound
train
of
reasoning
that
that's
what
they
were
trying
to
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
manual
had
said
there
are
certain
visual
cues
that
indicate
jurors
you
don't
want
on
the
jury.
you
don't
want
black
jurors.
you
don't
want
women
jurors.
you
don't
want
jewish
jurors.
you
don't
want
fat
ones.
you
don't
want
bearded
ones.
and
these
are
the
things
that
they
were
noting.
isn't
the
reasonable
inference
that
that's
what
they
were
noting
them
for?
justice
david
h.
souter
first,
the
opinion
in
miller-el.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
in
1986,
the
petitioner,
miller-el,
was
convicted
of
capital
murder
and
sentenced
to
death.
miller-el
brought
a
federal
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
which
he
alleges
that
the
prosecutors
in
his
trial
made
peremptory
strikes
of
potential
jurors
based
on
race
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
denied
relief.
two
terms
ago,
this
court
decided
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
in
error
in
failing
to
grant
miller-el
permission
to
appeal
the
district
court’s
denial
of
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
reviewing
the
evidence,
we
found
that
the
merits
of
miller-el’s
claim
were
debatable
at
the
least.
on
remand,
the
fifth
circuit
heard
the
appeal
and
rejected
the
claim
of
discriminatory
jury
selection.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
again
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
hold
that
miller-el
has
made
out
his
discrimination
claim.
the
prosecution
in
his
case
peremptorily
struck
at
least
two
black
potential
jurors
who
expressed
views
similar
to
those
of
non-black
panelists
who
are
not
strucked.
and
there
were
other
indications
of
racial
discrimination
by
the
prosecutors.
they
used
the
tactic
known
as
the
jury
shuffle
or
the
random
rearranging
of
the
seating
order
of
panel
members
when
black
panelists
were
concentrated
at
the
top
of
the
order
of
questioning.
they
described
the
death
penalty
in
graphic
detail
to
black
panelists
more
often
than
to
others
to
weed
out
the
black
panelists
by
prompting
them
to
express
opposition
to
the
death
penalty.
they
also
asked
manipulative
questions
about
the
minimum
punishment
for
murder
more
often
to
black
panelists.
and
these
prosecutors
who
are
trained
in
a
district
attorney’s
office
that
used
a
manual
recommending
the
exclusion
of
minorities
from
juries
made
notes
of
the
race
of
every
panelist.
the
state
court’s
findings
of
no
discrimination
were
unreasonable.
the
case
is
remanded
for
entry
of
judgment
for
miller-el.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
join.
