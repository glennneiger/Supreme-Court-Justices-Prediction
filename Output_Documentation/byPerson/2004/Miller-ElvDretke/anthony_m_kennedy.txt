were
there
any...
were
there
any
state
decisions,
or
federal
court
decisions
for
that
matter,
justifying
the
shuffle
on
the
grounds
of...
i
don't
know...
professional
class
versus
working
class
or
something
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
there...
were
there
any
state
court
cases
said
that...
or
even
in
that
case
you're
referring
to...
that
the
shuffle
usually
is
race-based?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
we
find
or
if
there
is
a
finding
that
the...
that
the
attempted
shuffle
on
this
fifth
try
was
race-based,
does
that
win
your
case,
even
though
the
shuffle
didn't
take
place?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
does
it
show
the
necessary
animus
so
that
it
carries
through
the
whole
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
now,
nelson...
there's
macaluso?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
macaluso
and
nelson.
nelson
wasn't
involved
in
the
jury
selection
in
this
case,
was
he?
he
came
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought
he
came
in
after...
after
the
jury
had
been
selected.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
you
have
10
white
jurors
and
10
black
jurors.
the
10
black
jurors
are
all
questioned
much
more
extensively
by
the
state,
and
in
each
of
those
cases,
there
is
a
plausible
reason
for
excusing.
a
relative
was...
served
time
and
so
forth.
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
then
you
admit
that
you
have
to
go
one
by
one.
i
had
thought
you
would...
would
have
said
that
if
the
black
jurors
are
questioned
in
a
different
way
and
more
intensively,
that
alone
suffices
even
though
the
questioning
in
each
case
disclosed
the
basis,
plausible,
non-racial
basis--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--for
excusing
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would...
would
the
statement
that
you
gave...
let's
assume
there
was
a...
a
working
premise
that
blacks
were
more...
were
less
inclined
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
would
that
alone
justify
more
intensive
questioning
of
every
black
juror?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
suppose...
suppose
you
have
a
system
in
which
that
attempt
to
find
cause
is
applied
much
more
rigorously
to
black
prospective
jurors
than
to
white
prospective
jurors.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
the...
the
white
jurors
don't
express
the
views
at
all
because
they're
not
questioned
intensively,
so
you
don't
know
if
there's
cause
for
them
or
not.
but
the
black
jurors
are
questioned
intensively,
and
you
find
cause
or...
or
a...
a
race-neutral
reason
for
the
dismissal.
is
there
a
batson
violation
in...
in
that
instance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
you
say
that
in
any
case
you
can
question
black
jurors
more
intensively
than
white
jurors
and
still
succeed
in
excusing
them
if
the
result
of
that
voir
dire
shows
some
race-neutral
basis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose...
suppose
you
have
a
manual
of...
from
the
district
attorney's
office
that
says
all
black
jurors
shall
be
questioned
more
intensively
than
white
jurors.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on...
on
that
point,
this
is
not
exactly
like
mcdonnell
douglas,
burdine
where
you
have
some
prima
facie
case,
the
person
was
equally
qualified,
but
was
of
a
different
gender
than
the
one
that
got
the
job,
and
then
the...
you
go
back
to
square
one.
here,
the
prima
facie
case
is
immensely
powerful
because
of
the
culture
of
discrimination
in
the
manuals
and
so
forth,
and
that...
that,
it
seems
to
me,
stays
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
there
any--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
were
the...
were
the
cues
on
the
card
similar
to
the
instructions
in
the
manual?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
quantify
the
correlation
or
lack
of
correlation
for
me?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wasn't
that
2
months?
