we'll
hear
argument
now
in
arthur
andersen
v.
united
states.
ms.
mahoney.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
a
"document"?
i
mean,
in
justice
kennedy's
example,
is
it
just
some
handwritten
notes?
do
they
become
"documents"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
mahoney.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
could
undermine
and
be
unsuccessful.
it's
not
as
though
undermine
means
that
you're
necessarily
going
to
succeed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
big,
heavy
guy
would
violate
the
statute
just
by
standing
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
ms.
mahoney,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mahoney.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
arthur
andersen
versus
the
united
states.
as
enron
corporation's
financial
difficulties
became
public
in
2001,
petitioner
arthur
andersen,
enron's
auditor,
instructed
its
employees
to
destroy
documents
pursuant
to
a
document
retention
policy.
a
jury
found
that
this
made
andersen
criminally
liable
as
a
corrupt
persuader
under
section
1512(b)
of
title
18,
and
the
section
is
dealing
with
obstruction
of
justice.
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
hold
that
the
phrase
"knowingly
corruptly
persuades"
in
1512(b)
requires
a
consciousness
of
wrongdoing
and
that
one
cannot
knowingly
corruptly
persuade
another
to
shred
documents
unless
one
foresees
a
particular
official
proceeding
in
which
those
documents
might
be
material.
the
jury
instructions
here
failed
to
correctly
convey
these
statutory
elements.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
