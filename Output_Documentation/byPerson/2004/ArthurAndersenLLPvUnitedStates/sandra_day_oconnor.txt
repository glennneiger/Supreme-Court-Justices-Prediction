justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--may
i
ask
you
about
another
provision,
section
1515(c)?
and
that
says,
this
chapter...
and
it...
and
it's
referring
back
to
section
1512...
"does
not
prohibit
or
punish
the
providing
of
lawful
bona
fide
legal
representation
services
in
connection
with,
or
anticipation
of,
an
official
proceeding.
"
now,
how...
did
ms.
temple
invoke
that
provision
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
know,
is,
in
light
of
the
government's
position
and
the
way
this
case
was
resolved,
how
does
that
fit,
and
what
does
it
do
to,
that
so-called
safe-harbor
provision?
i'm
just
curious
how
it
all
plays
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
that
have
the
effect
of
negating
the
safe-harbor
provision,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
the
effect,
in
1512(b),
of
the
word
"knowingly"?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
section
1519
at
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
section
1519,
enacted
subsequently,
comes
closer
to
the
mark,
doesn't
it,
than
1512?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
the
pettibone
interpretation
that
has
been
outstanding
for
a
long
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
about
this
precise
thing.
is
it
mr.
duncan?
if
he
had,
himself,
shredded
the
documents,
or
destroyed
them,
that
was
perfectly
okay
at
the
time
it
was
done.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would
not
have
been
a
violation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
government
got
the
conviction,
got
him
to
plead
guilty,
apparently,
on
the
basis
that
if
he
asked
somebody
else
to
do
what
was
perfectly
lawful
for
him
to
do,
it
would
violate
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what...
how
do
you
read
that
in
coordination
with
the
so-called
safe-harbor
provision
for
legal
advice
and
so
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
woman
lawyer
never
raised
it,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
under
this
statute,
with
the
safe-harbor
provision
in
it,
is
it
unlawful
for
her,
as
a
lawyer,
to
say,
"you
can
destroy
these
documents"?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
the
word
"knowingly".
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
in
1512.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
the
rule
of
lenity
in
the
criminal
statutes?
if
this
thing
is
so
confusing,
how's
the
business
person
supposed
to
know
what
they
can
do?
how's
the
lawyer
supposed
to
know?
