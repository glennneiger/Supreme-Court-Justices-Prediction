how
does
david
duncan's
guilty
plea...
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
charge
of
obstruction,
and
he
confessed
the
intent
to
impede
the
sec
investigation
by
shredding
documents.
so,
what
were
the
elements
of
that
offense
that

so,
it
was
proper,
then,
for
michael
odom
to
tell
the
andersen
personnel
when
he's
encouraging
them
to
follow
the
policy...
he
said,
"if
it's
destroyed
in
the
course
of
normal
policy
and
litigation,
and
litigation
is
filed
the
next
day,
that's
great.
"
"we
followed
our
policy,
and
whatever
there
was
that
might
have
been
of
interest
to
somebody,
it's
gone
and
irretrievable.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
fine
for
him
to
make
that
linkage
between,
"destroy
it.
"
"maybe
there's
going
to
be
litigation
filed
tomorrow.
"
"that's
great.
"
"it
will
be
gone?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
odom
wasn't
saying
this
in
the
abstract.
there
were
other
proceedings,
weren't
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
the
time
of
that
training,
were
there
not
other
proceedings
involving
arthur
andersen?
