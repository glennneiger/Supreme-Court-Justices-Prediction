mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
arthur
andersen's
conduct
in
this
case
explains
why
congress
enacted
a
statute
like
section
1512
that
protects
against
the
anticipatory
destruction
of
documents
when
a
proceeding
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
o'connor,
section
1519
was
enacted
after
the
events--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
this
case
in
order
to
plug
the
loophole
that
arthur
andersen
has
pointed
out
existed
in
section
1512
at
the
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
the
law
did
not
already
do
what
1519
says.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
reaches
single-actor
obstructive
conduct.
what
ms.
mahoney
has
said--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--pettibone
applied,
justice
o'connor,
to
a
specific
statute,
section
1503,
and
it's
similarly
incorporated
in
1505.
those
statutes
protected
against
obstruction
of
pending
judicial,
administrative,
and
congressional
proceedings.
the
innovation
in
section
1512
was
to
reach
beyond
the
existence
of
a
pending
proceeding
and
to
ensure
that
basically
the
store
doesn't
get
robbed
before
the
proceeding
starts.
if
arthur
andersen
is
correct,
the
anticipation
of
a
grand
jury
investigation
that
is
thought
to
occur
the
next
day,
a
corporation
can
send
out
a
directive
to
its
employees
and
say,
"shred
all
the
smoking
guns".
it's
the
corporate
equivalent
of
seeing
something
that
looks
like
a
crime
scene
and
sending
somebody
in
before
the
police
can
get
the
yellow
tape
up
to
wipe
down
the
fingerprints.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
that's
not
our
theory
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--our
theory
is
that
a
person
acts
corruptly
when
anticipating
a
reasonable
possibility
of
an
investigation
into
a
specific
matter,
directs
another
person
to
destroy
documents
that
are
potentially
relevant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
there's
anything
unusual
about
the
decision
of
that
kind
of
question
at
all.
it's
a
analogous,
but
different
and
quite
distinguishable
nexus
requirement
from
the
kind
of
nexus
requirement
that
this
court
interpreted
section
1503
to
have
in
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
kennedy,
it
turns
on
whether
the
intent
there
is
to
subvert,
undermine,
or
impede
the
proceeding.
and
the
answer
is,
if
it
is
yes,
then
it
would
be
prohibited
by
this
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
was
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
seemed
strange
to
congress,
too.
and
when
this
case
threw
a
spotlight
on
that
omission
in
the
statute,
congress
didn't
react--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
was
weird
about
it,
justice
scalia,
is
that
it
allowed
the
person
to
do
it
himself.
and
when
congress--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
wasn't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--prohibited
by
this
statute.
and
when--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
that
the
safe-harbor
provision
substantially
bears
on
this
case
at
all.
first
of
all,
arthur
andersen
never
raised
the
safe-harbor
provision,
so
that
the
government
would--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--nancy
temple
was
not
a
defendant
in
this
case,
but
her
conduct
was
at
issue,
because,
after
having
immediately
recognized
that
an
sec
investigation
was
highly
probable,
nancy
temple
sends
out
a
document
reminder
saying--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--basically,
"purge
the
files".
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
it
is,
in
this
case,
if
her
intent
was
to
subvert,
undermine,
or
impede
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy,
because
the
government's
position
here
has
never
been
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
document-destruction
policy
used
under
routine
circumstances
is
a
violation
of
the
statute.
what
the
government
focused
on
in
this
case
was
using
a
document-destruction
policy
as
a
pretext
and
a
cover
to
clean
up
and
purge
files
when
a
government
investigation
was
anticipated
and
it
was
perceived
that
these
materials
would
be
relevant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
see--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--under
this
statute,
justice
kennedy,
that's
not
the
issue.
i
think
the
timeline
here
is
critical.
this
was
not
a
company
that
was
routinely
exercising
a
document-destruction
policy,
or
document-retention
policy,
to
maintain
only
that
which
was
necessary
for
its
ongoing
business.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
but
that
was
triggered,
in
part,
by
nancy
temple's
recognition...
in
the
midst
of
serving
on
a
crisis
response
team,
recognizing
that
enron
was
in
the
process
of
imploding,
arthur
andersen,
which
was
basically
on
probation
with
the
sec...
because
it
had
been
previously
sanctioned,
twice,
during
the
prior
summer,
and
was
under
a
cease
and
desist
order...
and
seeing
the
sec
coming
down
the
pike,
at
that
moment,
she
decides
to
remind
the
enron
team,
which
had
not
been
at
all
compliant
with
this
document-retention
policy,
"it's
time
to
get
the
files
in
line.
"
this
wasn't
because
all
of
a
sudden
the
company
had
become
preoccupied
with
neatness;
it
was
so
that
it
could
document,
in
its
audit
work
papers,
those
things
that
supported
its
conclusions.
that's
what
its
document
policy
said.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--not
before
enron's
problems
had
begun
to
become...
surfacing
in
the
wall
street
journal,
in
the
financial
press,
the
stock
price
was
sliding.
everybody
who
was
sophisticated
in
this
environment...
and
surely
arthur
andersen
was...
knew
that
when
a
fortune
500
company
is
looking
at
a
potential
need
to
restate
its
income
statements
because
the
accountants
have
been...
proved
a
black-and-white
violation
of
gaap,
and
they
all
knew
that
that
was
true,
that
sec
proceedings
are
likely
to
occur.
even
the
witness--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no
other
company
in
the
country
would
do
this,
justice
kennedy.
this
is
an
extraordinary
case
precisely
because--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
in
an
organizational
context,
that's
the
only
way
that
directives
like
this
can
be
given
out
and
implemented.
this
wasn't
a
case
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
it
would--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--be
"corrupt".
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
it
does
cover
this
case,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
the
facts
of
the
case
are
subsumed
within
the
description
that
you've
given.
the
jury
instructions
did
not
require
findings
on
all
of
those
features;
and
that
is,
in
large
part,
because
of
the
kinds
of
instructions
that
arthur
andersen--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
jury
instruction
said
less
than
what
you
have
suggested,
justice
breyer,
no
question
about
it,
but
what
they
did
require
was
that
there
be
an
intent
to
undermine,
subvert,
or
impede
the
investigation.
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
souter,
this
is
to
statute,
and
the
word
"corruptly"
is
not
a
word,
that
has
been
ever
construed
to
require
consciousness
of
illegality.
that
is
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--definitely
not.
the
word
"knowingly"
usually
connotes
knowledge
of
the
underlying
facts.
and,
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
word
"knowingly"
does
not
travel
down
the
statute
to
modify
"corruptly".
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
there
is
a
logical
break,
because
if
it
travel
down
the
statute
and
reach
all
the
way
to
"misleading
conduct",
what
congress
would
have
written
is
a
statute,
when
you
read
the
definition
of
"misleading
conduct",
that
says,
"whoever
knowingly
knowingly
makes
a
false
statement.
"
because
the
definition
of
misleading
conduct
includes
"knowingly
making
false
statements",
"knowingly
omitting
things",
"intentionally
engaging
in
deceptive
behavior".
and
you'd
end
up
with
a...
in
a
redundancy
that
makes
no
sense
whatsoever.
it
makes
sense
for
congress
to
have
said,
"knowingly
used
force
or
intimidation".
but
then
when
you
get
to
the
word
"threat",
there
is
inherent
knowledge
in
it.
"corruptly"
inherently
embodies
knowledge.
and
the
definition
of
"misleading
conduct"
inherently--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--embodies
knowledge.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
let
me
try
to
address
each
of
those.
first
of
all,
the
words
were
used
as
a
definition
of
"improper
purpose",
and
they
were
used
together,
"subvert,
undermine,
or
impede.
"
and
they
logically
have
a
relationship
to
each
other.
when
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
those
words
and
defined
them,
which
it
did,
it
talked
about
subversion
and
undermining
as
being
a
ruining
of
the
proceedings
and
an
overthrow
of
the
attempt
that
the
government
was
anticipated
to
make.
and
i
think,
"impede"
has
to
be
read
logically
in
that
group.
now,
i
will
acknowledge
that
"impeding"
can
have
broader
connotations,
but
it's
not
a
word
that's
is
foreign
to
the
obstruction--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--here
is
what
it
adds,
justice
souter.
"undermine"
and
"subvert"
have
a
connotation
of
completely
preventing
the
performance
of
the
official
duty
in
the
proceeding.
"impede"
removes
any
implication
that
you
need
to
totally
thwart
the
government
activity
in
order
to
be
guilty
of
this
crime.
it's
enough
to
"interfere"
with
it,
which
is
the
word
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
to
define
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
but
it
was
to
avoid
any
connotation
that
the
jurors
might
put
on
the
linkage
of
those
words
that
the
government
sought
the
use
of
the
word
"impede".
and
i
should
note
that
it
appears,
in
section
1503,
section
1505--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
but
what--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
the
government
was
doing
in
this
instance
was
attempting
to
give
content
to
the
word
"corruptly"
that
would
enable
the
jurors
to
know
that
they
can
convict
if
the
purpose
that
the
defendant
had
in
dusting
off
this
document
policy
and
using
it
as
a
pretext
to
destroy
documents
was
to
interfere
with
the
fact-finding
ability
of
an
anticipated
proceeding.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
it's
a
definition
of
"corruptly"
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
court
of
appeals
addressed
the
argument,
which
petitioner
makes,
that
the
definition
of
"corruptly"
that
was
used
in
this
case
is
redundant
and
superfluous
in
light
of
the
additional
intent
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
they
have
a
very
significant
difference,
an
important
function
in
ensuring
that
this
statute
is
not
applied
beyond
the
scope
of
protection
of
the
integrity
of
proceedings,
which
is
what
congress
intended
it
to
do.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
on
page
5(a)...
or,
i'm
sorry,
on
page
3(a)--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--of
the
government's
appendix--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--to
its
brief,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
subsection
(b)--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--appears,
"whoever
knowingly
uses
intimidation
or
physical
force--
"
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--et
cetera.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
last
phrase
in
the
sequence
is
"engages
in
misleading
conduct
towards
another
person.
"
that
phrase
is,
in
turn,
defined
in
the
statute
on
page
11(a)
and
12(a)
of
the
same
appendix,
the
government's
appendix.
it's
section
1515(a)(3).
and
it
says
the
term
"misleading
conduct"
means
"knowingly
making
a
false
statement;
intentionally
omitting
information
from
a
statement;
with
intent
to
mislead,
knowingly
submitting
or
inviting
reliance
on
a
writing;
or,
with
intent
to
mislead,
knowingly
submitting
or
inviting
reliance
on
a
sample.
"
and,
finally,
"knowingly
using
a
trick
scheme
or
device.
"
so,
1512
when
it
comes
to
defining
the
term
"engaging
in
misleading
conduct",
so
you
would
end
up
with
a
statute
that
congress
have,
for
some
reason,
drafted
that
includes
the
word
"knowingly"
at
the
beginning,
and
then
"knowingly"
later
as
the
definition
of
one
of
the
terms
that
the
initial
"knowingly"--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--you
avoid
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
it's,
"whoever
knowingly
uses
intimidation
or
physical
force.
"
that's
what
"knowingly"
applies
to.
and
then
the
words
"threaten,
corruptly
persuade,
and
engages
in
misleading
conduct.
"
have
inherent
knowledge
in
them.
in
other
words--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right,
because
1512
is
a
direct
lineal
descendant
from
the
fact
that
that
word
appears
in
section
1503.
when
congress
enacted
this
statute,
it
had
every
reason
to
believe,
because
it
intended
to
do
this,
that
the
definition
of
1503,
would
be
applied
to
1512.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and,
in
that
context--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
that's
sort
of
reading
the
statute
just
to
achieve
a
result.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it's
contrary
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--because
a
"threat",
itself,
which
is
the
third
term
in
the
series,
and
the
one
that
precedes
the
term
that's
at
issue
here,
also
involves
an
element
of
scienter
or
knowledge.
you
can
use
intimidation
inadvertently.
you
could
be
a
very
heavy,
dangerous-looking
guy,
standing
out
in
front
of
the
grand
jury
room,
and
a
witness
might
come
along
and
see
you
and
realize,
to
himself,
"uh-oh,
i'm
in
trouble
if
i
testify.
"
if
you
haven't
done
that
knowingly--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--he
wouldn't,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
precisely
because
it
requires
that
he
knowingly
use
intimidation.
so
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
they're
actually
quite
different
in
the
context
of
this
statute,
but
even
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
"knowingly"
did
travel
down
and
produce
a
phrase,
"knowingly
corruptly",
the
word
"knowingly"
generally
in
the
criminal
law
refers
to
"knowledge
of
the
facts
that
make
your
conduct
unlawful.
"
arthur
andersen
here
is
asking
for
a
very--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that
it
does,
justice
breyer.
there
are,
of
course,
contexts
where
the
court
concludes
that
a
statute,
after
applying
all
the
tools
of
statutory
construction,
is
ambiguous,
and
then
rules
of
construction
do
apply
to
narrow
it;
but
there
is
no
provision
that
says
that
the
court
should
approach
the
question
of
construction
with
a
view
to
narrow
it.
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that
it
is
that
confusing,
justice
o'connor.
this
is
a
statute
that
was
enacted
against
the
backdrop
of
section
1503
in
a
well-understood
meaning
of
the
word
"corruptly".
the
same
word
appears
in
section
1505.
when
the
d.c.
circuit
concluded
that
that
provision
was
vague,
as
applied
to
a
particular
case,
congress
came
back
with
a
definition
that
legislatively
overruled
the
d.c.
circuit
decision
and
said
"corruptly"
means
"acting
with
an
improper
purpose".
the
"improper
purpose"
in
an
obstruction-of-justice
case
has
traditionally
been
"the
purpose
to
obstruct
justice".
that
definition
logically
applies
to
section
1512,
because
congress
enacted
the
corruptly-persuades
provision
to
remedy
a
deficiency
in
prior
law,
because
it
had
not
included
non-coercive,
non-deceptive
witness-tampering
in
the
statute,
originally.
and
some
courts
concluded
that
it
was
no
longer
punishable
under
section
1503,
either.
to
fix
that
situation,
congress
looked
to
the
model
of
section
1503
case
law,
where
there
had
been
a
variety
of
acts
that
are
covered
that
under
petitioner's
test
would
not
be,
such
as
secreting
a
witness,
or
sequestering
a
witness,
in
anticipation
of
a
subpoena
so
that
the
witness
would
be
unavailable
to
testify,
or
destroying
documents
before
a
subpoena
had
been
issued,
but
in
an
anticipation
that
the
subpoena
was
likely.
those
kinds
of
acts
were
considered
to
be
unlawful.
similarly,
giving
advice,
even
as
a
lawyer,
to
an
individual
to
assert
the
fifth
amendment
in
bad
faith,
not
to
protect
that
individual's
own
interest,
but
to
obstruct
justice
by
protecting
other
members
of
a
criminal
organization,
or,
indeed,
the
lawyer
himself,
lower
courts
had
recognized
could
be
prosecuted;
not
uniformly
had
recognized,
but
they
had
uniformly
recognized
it
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
this
statute.
and
congress
specifically
said,
"we
want
1512
to
be
able
to
pick
up
the
kinds
of
cases
that
some
courts
have
said
are
no
longer
prosecutable
under
section
1503,
and
that
had
not
been
included
in
the
original
version
of
1512.
"
so
that
there
is
history
here
that
explains
how
these
terms
should
be
applied.
and
as
far
as
petitioner's
contention
that
the
word
"corruptly"
does
nothing
and
leads
to
a
series
of
horrible
hypotheticals,
actually
a
sensitive
and
appropriate
use
of
the
word
"corruptly"
solves
those
problems.
petitioners
talk
about
how
people
should
be
able
to
urge
each
other
not
to
cooperate
with
a
voluntary
investigation,
that
it's
part
of
citizenship
to
be
able
to
engage
in
those
conversations.
but
if
an
entity
has
subpoena
authority
and
it
doesn't
invoke
it,
and
it
simply
invites
people
voluntarily
to
cooperate,
it
is
not
going
to
be
an
intent
to
subvert,
undermine,
or
impede
that
proceeding
to
invite
them
to
exercise
that
right.
if
the
agency
wants
their
testimony,
it
can
get
it
through
compulsion.
similarly,
petitioners
argue
that
document
policies
are,
per
se,
made
unlawful
under
the
government's
approach.
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
recognized
in
this
case,
a
sound
application
of
the
word
"corruptly"
would
look
to
whether
there
is
a
threat
of
some
kind
of
specific
proceeding
that
might
trigger
an
obligation
not
to
destroy
the
documents
before
the
proceeding
gets
started.
and,
as
well,
there
are
intents
that
are
simply
not
intents
to
subvert
the
administration
of
justice,
that
may
result
in
rendering
certain
evidence
unavailable.
and
if
a
person
engages
in
that
conduct,
it
may
well
violate
another
provision
of
criminal
law,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
violate
1512.
and
a
sound
use
of
"corruptly"
prevents
all
of
those
hypotheticals
from
materializing
and
leading
to
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
is
unduly
broad.
now,
petitioner
in
this
case,
in
addition
to
attacking
the
word
"corruptly",
also
has
advanced
a
number
of
arguments
that
there
was
inadequate
instruction
on
some
connection
that
had
to
be
required
between
the
defendant's
intent
in
a
possible
future
proceeding.
but
the
reason
that
there
was
no
adequate
instruction
on
those
issues
is
largely
because
petitioner,
itself,
deliberately
decided
to
ask
for
two
instructions
that
were
contrary
to
the
statute,
and
never
asked
for
what
it's
asked
this
court
to
impose
today.
it
never
asked
that
the
defendant
must
be
shown
to
believe
that
some
particular
proceeding
was
likely
to
occur
in
the
near
future.
instead,
what
it
did
is
say
that
the
defendant
had
to
have
an
intent
to
impair
an
object's
availability
for
use
in
a
particular
proceeding.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
that
if
there
was
any
problem
in
that,
it's
not
reversible
error;
it's
harmless,
because
everybody
knew
that
the
proceeding
that
was
anticipated
was
an
sec
investigation
of
enron.
and
the
other
instruction
that
petitioners
asked
for
in
the
district
court
is
that
the
official
proceeding
must
be
ongoing
or
scheduled
to
be
commenced
in
the
future.
but
that
instruction
is
flatly
contrary
to
the
statute.
