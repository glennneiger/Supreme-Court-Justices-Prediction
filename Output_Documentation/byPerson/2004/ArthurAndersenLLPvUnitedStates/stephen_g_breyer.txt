you
used
words--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know
you
know
that
the...
you've
put
your
finger
on
a
problem
for
me.
you
have
said,
would
it
be
the
case
that
a
person,
before
the
proceeding
begins,
could
simply
tell
somebody
else
to
destroy
the
smoking
gun?
i
understand
that
you
fear
that
andersen's
approach
would
lead
to
that
result.
and
it's
bothering
me.
therefore,
i'd
like
you
whether
the
word
"corruptly"
could
include
a
person
who
knows
three
things:
one,
that
the
investigation,
which
has
not
yet
started,
almost
certainly
will
want
this
document;
two,
there
is
no
legal
right
to
withhold
it;
and,
three,
that
if
i
tell
him
to
do
it,
it
will
be
destroyed...
i
mean,
that
it's
important
to
the
investigation.
important
to
the
investigation,
they
want
it,
it's
cover-up,
and
they
will,
in
fact,
have
no
legal
right
to
take
it
back.
now,
would
that
be
"corrupt"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
if
that's
"corrupt",
then
does
that
cover
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how?
because
it
seems
to
me
there
was
quite
a
lot
of...
by
the
way,
the
person
who's
doing
the
persuading
has
to
know
this.
they
have
to
know
that
it
will
be
wanted,
that
it's
important,
and
there
is
no
legal
right
to
withhold
it.
so
it
seems
to
me
that,
on
the
one
hand,
that
does
cover
your
problem,
and,
on
the
other
hand,
it
does
not
cover
this
case.
now,
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
reply
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
jury
instruction
left
out
the
word
"corruptly",
as
far
as
i
can
see,
in
the
part
that
was
critical.
they
define
"corruptly"
as
simply
an
intent
to
impede.
and
the
word
"impede"
goes
well
beyond
what
i've
said,
both
because
it
does
not
cover
the
three
things,
but,
most
particularly,
because
it
does
not
say
that
it
was
dishonest
or
that
the
person
who
did
the
persuading
knew
that
the
jury
or
the
grand
jury
or
the
investigation
would
have
the
legal
right
to
get
the
material
and
there
was
no
right
to
withhold
it.
the
words
that
arthur
andersen
suggested,
while
they
don't
say
precisely
that,
were
at
least
a
step
in
the
right
direction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
it
sounds
like...
actually,
i'll
grant
you
that
it
appears
in
the
statute,
but
that's,
in
a
sense,
my
problem.
the
statute
talks
about
"corruptly
persuading
another
person
to
destroy
a
paper
with
the
intent
to
impair
that
paper's
availability
for
use
in
an
official
proceeding.
"
so,
then
we
look
at
the
instruction,
and
the
instruction
speaks
of
"destroying
the
paper
with
the
intent,
at
least
in
part,
to
impede.
"
fine.
it
sounds
like
it's
just
the
same
as
the
statute,
but
for
one
thing,
the
omission
in
the
instruction
of
the
word
"corruptly".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
to
define
"corruptly"
as
"doing
the
same
thing
that
the
rest
of
the
statute
does.
"
seems
a
little
strange.
if
i
were
a
juror,
i
might
think
that
there
is
missing
here
any
dishonesty
of
purpose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
perfectly
redundant.
one
can
imagine
driving
a
wedge
between
making
something
unavailable,
which
the
jury
would
find
relevant,
or
the
investigator
would
find
relevant,
and
impeding
the
fact-finding
ability
of
the
investigator.
they're
not
logically
identical,
but
they
do
strike
me
as
so
similar
that
it's
hard
to
expect
a
juror
to
make
much
of
a
difference
between
those
two
phrases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
the...
in
general
terms,
when
you
speak
of
"general
interpretation",
i
suppose
i
think
it
possible
to
approach
ambiguous
criminal
statutes
with
the
following
idea.
congress
did
not
intend
to
try
to
make
of
the
statute
a
highly
general
weapon
for
the
justice
department
to
pick
and
choose.
that's
a
notification
problem.
it's
also
because
we
don't
want
one
law,
"it
is
a
crime
to
do
wrong,
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general.
"
you
know,
i
mean,
we
want
to
have
narrow
criminal
statutes.
now,
is
it
reasonable
to
start
with
that
frame
of
mind?
and
if
it
is,
doesn't
that
tend
to
cut
against
you
in
this
case?
