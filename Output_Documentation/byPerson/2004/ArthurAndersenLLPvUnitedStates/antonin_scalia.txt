how
do
you
know
it's
not
an
affirmative
defense?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course,
it
has
the
word
"lawful",
"the
providing
of
lawful
bona
fide
legal
representation
services.
"
so,
you
know,
it
could
be
argued
that
if
she
violating
the
other
provisions,
she's
still
in
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
sentence
did
he
get,
by
the
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
it
also
would
make
"intimidate",
and
so
forth,
quite
superfluous.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mahoney,
we...
you
know,
we
all
know
that
what
are
euphemistically
termed
"record-retention
programs"
are,
in
fact,
record-destruction
programs,
and
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
destruction
is
to
eliminate
from
the
files
information
that
private
individuals
can
use
for
lawsuits
and
that
government
investigators
can
use
for
investigations.
and
there
has
been
nothing
unlawful
about
having
such
a
program,
even
if
one
of
your
purposes
is
not
to
leave
lying
around
in
the
file
stuff
that
can
be
used
against
you
by
either
the
government
or
a
private
individual.
so,
i
would
have
thought
that
your
argument
was
very
persuasive,
except
for
the
fact
of
1519.
i
think
that
1519
gives
me
cause
to
believe
that
congress
could,
indeed,
say,
"you
can't
have
record-retention
programs".
how
else
do
you
interpret
1519?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
i...
well,
yeah,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
your
argument
is,
you
know,
"it's
inconceivable
that
they
would
have
meant
that.
"
but,
my...
they
said
it
in
1519--
justice
antonin
scalia
----in
2002.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--wasn't
there
another
provision
in
effect
that
said
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the...
whether
the
proceeding
is
pending?
i
forget
which
one
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
it's
superfluous.
1519,
if
you
win
this
case,
really
is
just
an
exercise
in
futility,
because
the
law
already
did
what
1519
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
wherein
does
it
go
further?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
can
they
do
it?
you
didn't
allege
here
that
it
was
in
anticipation
of
any
particular
proceeding.
you
say
they
can't
do
it
once
they
know
that
the
investigation
is
on
the
way.
but
your
theory
in
this
case
is
that
they
can't
do
it,
whether
they
know
the
investigation
is
on
the
way
or
not.
they
can't
destroy
any
evidence
that
might
be
the
subject
of
an
investigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
theory?
justice
antonin
scalia
"a
reasonable
possibility
of
an
investigation.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
want
criminal
liability
to
turn
upon
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
an
investigation.
you
want
somebody
to
go
to
jail
on
how
a
jury
decides
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
would
be
prohibited
to
tell
somebody
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
could
do
it.
the
doing
of
it
is
perfectly
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
that
seem
strange
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
suggest
that
it
throws
a
spotlight
on
the
fact
that
your
theory
is
wrong.
it
doesn't--
[laughter]
--it
doesn't
make...
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
make
unlawful
the
asking
of
somebody
to
do
something
which
is,
itself,
not
unlawful,
so
that
the
person
could
do
it,
but
if
you
asked
them
to
do
it,
you're
guilty,
he's
not
guilty.
and
that's...
that
is
weird.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it
was.
the
training
session
that
you
introduced
in
evidence
was
precisely
that,
a
general
training
session
for
all
employees,
saying,
"this
is
our
document",
quote,
"retention
policy".
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says
that
occurred
before
enron
had
even
gotten
a
letter.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
meeting.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
it
would
be
perfectly
okay
for
this
company,
or
any
other
one,
to
destroy
their
documents.
what's
bad
is
telling
somebody
to
destroy
the
documents.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
"knowingly"?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
"knowingly"?
does
that...
does
that
usually
connote
knowledge
of
the
illegality?
justice
antonin
scalia
"knowingly
corruptly".
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
would
you
indulge
me
to
go
back
to
a
previous
answer
you
gave?
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
quite
get
it.
in
responding
to
justice
souter's
inquiry
concerning
the
word
"knowingly",
you
said
the
word
"knowingly"
appears
later,
so
that
it
would
be...
it
would
be
reduplicative.
what
later
appearance
are
you
talking
about,
in
1512(b)?
justice
antonin
scalia
3(a),
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
know
how
you
can
avoid
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
"whoever
knowingly
engages
in
misleading
conduct.
"
which
is
later
defined
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
i
see.
the
"knowingly"
only
applies
to
"uses
intimidation
or
physical
force".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you
can...
you
can
use
intimidation
unknowingly,
any
more
than
you
can
threaten
unknowingly.
if
they
felt
it
necessary
to
put
"knowingly"
before
"use
intimidation",
i
think
they
would
have
felt
it
necessary
to
put
"knowingly"
before
"threaten".
the
two
terms
are
just
about
identical.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
think
it
should
have
been?
