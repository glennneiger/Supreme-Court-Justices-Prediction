isn't
that
satisfied
at
least
by
the
part
of
the
definition
that
refers
to
"subverting
an
official
proceeding"?
i
mean,
that
certainly
carries,
to
me,
the
implication
that
you
realize
that
you're
doing
something
wrong.
an
official
proceeding
is,
prima
facie
at
least,
lawful,
and
you
are
subverting
it.
doesn't
that
satisfy
the
"knowingly"
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
think
i
would
go
far
in
agreeing
with
you
if
the...
if
the
instruction
had
been
"merely
to
impede"
or
"merely
to
undermine".
now,
i
guess
that
gets
to
a
question
i
wanted
somebody
to
answer,
and
you
can
probably
do
it.
did
the...
did
the
court,
in
giving
the
instructions,
ever
refer...
in
defining
the
term,
ever
refer
to
any
of
these
three
possibilities,
separately,
or
did
it
do
it
simply
as
"subvert,
undermine,
or"...
what
was
the
third...
"impede"?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
it
did--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i...
one
other
question.
in
anticipation
of
that
instruction...
i
assume
the
counsel
new
what
was
coming...
did
the
government
ever
argue
to
the
jury
that
"merely
impeding",
alone,
or
"merely
undermining",
alone,
would
be
sufficient,
as
distinct
from
saying,
"if
he
subverts,
undermines,
and
impedes?
"
justice
david
h.
souter
there
were,
involving
enron,
at
that
point,
isn't
that
correct?
the...
enron
had
gotten
the
letter?
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't...
wasn't
that
instruction,
itself,
undermined
by
what
i
understand
to
be
the
instruction
that
good-faith
belief
in
the
legality
of
what
was
being
done
was
no
defense?
i
mean,
if
you
had
an
instruction
that
depended
upon
the
word
"subvert",
i
could...
i
could
understand
your
argument.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
difficulty
with
your
argument,
and
the
difficulty
with
your
answer
to
justice
breyer,
is
that
it
went
beyond
"subvert"
to
merely
"impede",
and
it
included
an
instruction
that
good
faith
was
no
defense.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
see
why
it
doesn't.
i
mean,
there's
no
grammatical
break.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
certainly--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
mean,
i
will...
i
will
grant
you
that
the
definition
that
the
government
asked
for,
and
got,
for
"corruptly
persuades",
does
have
that
implication,
so
far
as
the
"subvert"
prong
is
concerned.
but
when
you
get
beyond
the
"subvert"
prong,
and
you
get
down
to
the
third
one,
"merely
to
impede",
you're
getting
pretty
thin,
so
far
as
the...
as
the
implication
of
knowledge
of
wrongdoing
is
concerned,
and
you've
still
go
the
problem
of
the
instruction
that
negated
good
faith
is
a
defense.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
did...
if
that
is
so,
why
did
you
need
it?
in
other
words,
you
had
a...
you
had
a
pattern
instruction,
apparently,
that
was...
that
was
keyed
to
"subversion",
which
i
think
would
be
an
easy
argument
for
you.
if
the
addition
of
"impede"
really
wasn't
adding
that
much,
why
did
you
ask
the
court
to
put
it
in
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
isn't
the
answer
to
your
argument
that
the
requirement
in
(b)...
(b)
doesn't
travel
all
the
way
down
through
the
series,
but
it
travels
at
least
as
far
as
"corruptly
persuades"?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
we
know
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--applies
to
something
at
the
beginning
of
the
series.
it's
got...
it's
got
some
work
to
do.
you've
made
an
argument
that
it
doesn't
apply,
or
it
would
be
logically
absurd
to
apply
it,
to
something
at
the
end
of
the
series,
and
we're
somewhere
in
the
middle.
and
why
isn't
the
answer
to
your
argument
simply
to
say,
"okay,
it
doesn't
travel
all
the
way
to
the
end,
but
it
travels
up
to
the
end,
and
it
travels
as
far
as
this?
