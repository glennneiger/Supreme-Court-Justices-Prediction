ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
concedes
that
the
destruction
of
documents
in
anticipation
of
a
proceeding
was
not
a
crime
in
the
fall
of
2001
based
upon
a
statutory
rule
that
congress
had
preserved
for
over
a
century.
the
central
question
in
this
case
is
whether
congress,
nevertheless,
intended
to
make
a
polite
request
to
engage
in
that
lawful
conduct,
a
form
of
witness
tampering
punishable
by
ten
years
in
prison.
we
ask
this
court
to
reject
that
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
to
hold
that
arthur
andersen
did
not
commit
a
crime.
i'd
like
to
turn
first
to
the
term
1512
and
explain
why
arthur
andersen's
interpretation
represents
not
only
a
reasonable
reading,
but
the
best
reading
of
the
language
in
the
statute.
the
first
thing
that
we
see
when
we
look
at
the
statutory
context
is
that
congress
did
not
prohibit...
did
not
prohibit...
all
persuasion
to
destroy
documents
for
the
specific
purpose
of
making
them
unavailable
for
use
in
an
official
proceeding.
it
did
not,
because
it
did
not
simply
say,
"anyone
who
persuades
a
witness
to
do
this
has
violated
the
statute.
"
it
added
a
very
important
limitation,
and
that
is
the
word
"corruptly"...
"corruptly
persuades".
so
what
kinds
of
requests
are
excluded
from
the
definition?
when
is
it
that
it's
okay
to
persuade
someone
to
destroy
a
document
for
use
in
an
official
proceeding?
and
the
answer,
we
think,
based
on
the
traditional
meaning
of
the
term
"corruptly",
is
that
"corruptly"
means
that
you
have
persuaded
someone
in
a
fashion
that
uses
improper
means,
such
as
bribery,
or
you've
asked
the
witness
to
violate
duties
imposed
by
other
law,
whether
that's
the
duties
imposed
by
contempt
or
the
duties
imposed
by
a
whole
range
of
statutes
that
govern
the
obligations
of
people
in
our
society.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
if...
your
honor,
if
it
was
a
crime,
then,
yes--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--okay,
if
this
is
in
a...
in
the
course
of
a
proceeding,
of
course,
it's
obviously
going
to
be
a
crime,
it's
obviously
going
to
be
prohibited
by
section
1512.
if
it
is
in
advance
of
a
proceeding...
and
let's
assume
that
you
know
that
a
proceeding--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--is
likely,
then
the
answer
depends
on
whether
you
know
that
you
are
concealing...
that
you
know
a
crime
has
been
committed.
and
if
you
know
that
a
crime
has
bee
committed,
then
you
are
violating
a
federal
statute,
18
u.s.c.--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
in
that
case,
if
the
witness
knows
that
you
have
committed
a
crime,
and
you
are
asking
them
to
violate,
they
have
a
duty,
under
those
circumstances,
not
to
assist
you
in
concealing
your
offense.
that's
a
duty
that's
imposed
by
criminal
law.
so
if
you
ask
them
to
violate
that
duty,
then
you
are
corrupting
that
witness;
and,
very
definitely,
that
would
fall
within
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
arthur
andersen
is
advancing
here.
and
it
fits,
your
honor,
with
what
congress
really
did
for
a
hundred
years
before
2002.
what
it
did
is,
it
said
that...
under
the
pettibone
rule,
that
it
is
not
a
crime
to
simply
destroy
documents
in
anticipation
of
a
proceeding.
but
if
you
know
that...
if
you
know
that
a
crime
has
been...
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
you
destroy
documents,
that
is
a
crime.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
that's
a
crime--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
the...
that
section
was
not
argued
to
the
district
court,
but
it
was
invoked
in
the
following
way,
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
there
was
evidence
introduced
in
the
case
that
she
was
providing
legal
advice.
and
since
it
is
not
in
affirmative
defense,
it
really
was
the
government's
burden
at
all
times,
at
least
once
there
was
evidence
introduced
that
she
was
providing
legal
advice,
to
get
a
finding
from
the
jury
that
she
was
not
engaged
in
bona
fide
and
lawful
services,
particularly
in
this
case,
your
honor,
where
the
government
argued,
told
the
jury,
that
nancy
temple
was
the,
quote,
"central
figure",
end
quote,
in
this...
in
this
episode.
and
in
addition--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
it
doesn't
read
like
an
affirmative
defense,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
say
"affirmative
defense".
it
simply...
and
in...
when
it
was
introduced,
it
was
listed
in
the
legislation
as
a
rule
of
construction.
and
i
think
that's
exactly
how
it
reads.
it
doesn't
purport
to
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
andersen,
or
on
nancy
temple.
and,
your
honor,
i
think,
actually--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
your
honor,
under
the
government's
definition
of
"corruptly",
she
couldn't
have
been
providing
lawful
bona
fide
services.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i
think
it
negates
it
in
its
entirety,
because
what
the
jury
was
instructed
in
this
case
was
that
any
intent
to
impede
the
fact-finding
ability
of
a
possible
future
proceeding,
even
if
the
andersen
employee
had
a
good-faith
and
sincere
belief
that
their
conduct
conformed
to
the
law,
was
corrupt.
they
were
instructed
that
they
must
find
that.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
absolutely.
but
i
think,
your
honor...
because
i
think
it
would
be
impossible
to
satisfy
it
under
this
instruction.
in
addition,
i
also
think
that
the...
that
this
provision
really
just
demonstrates
that
the
government's
interpretation
of
"corruptly"
is
wrong,
to
begin
with.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
think,
your
honor,
that
"knowingly"
means,
in
this
context...
just
as
it
means
"knowingly
intimidate",
"knowingly
threatened",
"knowingly
corruptly
persuade"...
that
means
that
you
have
to
know
that
your
persuasion
is
asking
the
witness
to
violate
their
duties,
to
violate
the
law.
you
have
to
know
that
it's
corrupt.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
the
definition
that
was
given
to
this
jury
was
"subvert,
undermine,
or
impede.
"
and
not
just
the
integrity
of
the
proceeding;
but,
rather,
the
fact-finding
ability
of
a
future
proceeding--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--including
a
governmental
inquiry.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
impede.
i
believe...
i
believe
it
was
done
as
a...
as
a...
as
a
group.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
but
it
says
"or".
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
i'm
not
certain
of
the
answer,
except
that
i
do
know
that
the
government
did
argue
that
simply...
the
mere
idea
that
david
duncan
testified
that,
you
know,
he
thought
that
the...
somebody
at
the
sec
might
want
to
look
at
this
information
someday
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
instructions.
and
so,
i
think
it
is
a
fair
inference
that
the
way
that
they
argued
this
case
to
the
jury
was
that
any
intent
to
keep
any
kind
of
information
away
from
the
sec
was
enough
to
satisfy
the
definition
in
this
case.
and,
in
fact,
your
honor,
when
the
instructions
were
being
debated,
the
pattern
instruction
for
the
fifth
circuit
for
1503,
actually
is...
includes
the
words
"knowingly
or
dishonestly
to
subvert
the
integrity
of
the
proceeding.
"
the
government
insisted
that
the
word
"dishonestly"
not
be
used,
that
the
word
"impede"
be
added,
and
they
changed
"fact-finding"
a
bit...
changed
it
from
"subverting
the
proceedings"
to
"the
fact-finding
ability".
they
did
everything
they
could
to
strip
this
instruction
of
any
mens
rea,
and
then
went
beyond
that
and
said,
"and
in
addition,
even
if
the
andersen
employees
had
a
good-faith
and
sincere
belief
that
their
conduct
did
not
violate
the
law,
it's
still
a
crime.
"
so,
what
we
have
here
is
an
array
of
testimony
from
people
who
say,
"we
honestly
believed
that
this
was
permissible
conduct.
"
but
the
jury
was
told
that
they
had
to
convict
anyway
if
there
was
any
possible
partial
motivation
to
impede
possible
future
fact-finding--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--of
an
inquiry.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
he
plead
guilty
to
the
offense,
as
described
to
him
and
agreed
upon
between
him
and
his
lawyer;
in
other...
and
the
government...
which
is
basically
the
instruction
that
was
given
in
this
case.
when
he
testified
in
this
proceeding,
he
repeatedly
said,
despite
his
guilty
plea,
that
he
did
not
believe,
at
the
time,
that
he
had
done
anything
unlawful
or
improper.
he
said,
"i
thought
my
conduct
was
perfectly
appropriate.
"
"i
plead
guilty
because
i
was
persuaded
that
it
didn't
matter
what
i
thought
at
the
time.
"
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
he's
not
been
sentenced
yet,
your
honor.
and
he
was
explicit
throughout.
he
also
said...
he
never
testified
that
he
even
thought
that
an
sec
proceeding
was
probable
at
the
time;
he
just
thought
it
was
possible.
nor
did
he
say
that
he
ever
consciously
tried
to
hide
the
truth
or
hide
the
facts.
what
he
did
say
is
that,
"yes,
part
of
what
was
on
my
mind
at
the
time
that
i
asked
for
compliance
with
this
policy
was
that
the
sec
and
others
might
want
to
look
at
these
files
someday,
and
i'd
better
get
them
in
compliance
with
our
retention
policy,
because
i
know
that
drafts
and
notes
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
could
be
misused
and
misconstrued
at
some
point
in
the
future.
"
that
was
the
basis
of
his
guilty
plea,
that
was
the
basis
of
his
testimony
in
this
case.
and
the
government's
interpretation,
the
instructions
that
were
given
to
this
jury,
deprived
the
term
"corruptly
persuade"
of
any
of
its
ordinary
and
traditional
meaning.
under
the
government's
view,
for
instance,
of
"corruptly",
bribery
becomes
irrelevant
under
this
statute.
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
this
statute,
and
you
say,
"what
was
congress
trying
to
prohibit
here
when
it
says.
"
--it's
a
got
a
list
of
wrongful
means
of
interfering
with
witnesses.
it
says
"intimidate"
and
"threaten"
and
"use
of
physical
force",
and
it
says
"corruptly
persuades".
the
first
thing
that
would
come
to
your
mind
is
bribery.
but
bribery
is
irrelevant
under
the
government's
interpretation,
and
let
me
explain
why.
because
they
say
that,
"well,
yes,
it's
true,
it
says
"corruptly
persuade",
but
all
that
means
if
you...
is
if
you
had
any
intent
to
impede
the
fact-finding
ability
of
a
proceeding,
then
you're
guilty,
just
for
asking.
"
"it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
used
any
money...
monetary
compensation
in
order
to
extract
this
behavior;
you're
automatically
guilty.
"
"but
if
you
use
bribery--
"
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
absolutely
would,
your
honor,
because
it
would
basically
cover
any
kind
of
request.
but,
in
addition,
they
say
that
under
their
definition
what
it
really
means
is
that
if
you
did
it
for
some
other
motive,
if
you
got
them
to
destroy
the
document
so
that
it
couldn't
be
used
in
an
official
proceeding...
and
that
was
your
intent,
that
it
couldn't
be
used
in
an
official
proceeding...
and
you
bribed
them
to
do
it,
but
your
motive
was
to
avoid
embarrassment,
it
would
not
be
a
crime.
under
andersen's
interpretation,
it
would
still
be
a
crime,
because
of
course
you
have
corruptly
persuaded
them
to
destroy
a
document
for
use
in
an
official
proceeding,
even
if...
at
the
appropriate
time,
if
there
is
a
nexus...
because
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
were
trying
to
avoid
embarrassment;
if
you
were
bribing
them
to
keep
it
out
of
the...
of
the
proceeding,
of
course
that
would
be
covered
by
the
traditional
definition
of
"corruptly
persuade".
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
under
section
1519,
now,
it
may
well
be
that
that
is
criminal
behavior,
because
it...
congress
has
now,
basically,
required
you
to
preserve
documents.
but,
at
the
time,
no,
that
would
not
have
been
a
crime.
and
if
you
could
do
it
yourself,
then
asking
your
wife
to
throw
them
out
instead
can't
be
what
congress
really
had
in
mind
under
section
1512.
you
know,
hypothetical,
the
man
could
throw
it
out
himself
and
not
go
to
jail,
but
if
he
asked
his
wife
to
do
it,
then
he
goes
to
jail
for
ten
years.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
and
i
think
that
this
statute,
reasonably
read,
your
honor,
tells
you
exactly
what
that
specific
thing
is.
if
you
intimidate
them,
if
you
mislead
them,
if
you
use
physical
force,
if
you
corruptly
persuade
them.
and
that
means
either
you've
used
unlawful
means,
like
bribery,
or
you
asked
them
to
violate
their
independent
legal
duties.
and
that
definition,
your
honor,
is
quite
consistent
with
the
traditional
interpretation
of
the
term
"corruptly",
even
in
the
obstruction
statutes.
and
i'd
like
to
just
emphasize,
for
instance,
in
a
tampering
case,
a
juror
tampering
case
that
preceded
the
congressional
adoption
of
the
term
"corruptly
persuades",
the
jackson
case,
the
jury
was
specifically
instructed
that
"corruptly"
means
"knowingly
and
willfully,
with
the
specific
intent
to
influence
a
juror
to
violate
his
duties
as
a
petit
juror.
"
similarly,
in
aguilar,
in
the
district
court,
the
jury
was
instructed...
that
was
a
tampering
case...
quote,
"an
act
is
done
corruptly
if
it
is
done
voluntarily
and
intentionally
to
bring
about
either
an
unlawful
result
or
a
lawful
result
by
some
unlawful
method.
"
end
quote.
this
is
exactly
parallel
to
the
interpretation
that
andersen
is
asking
this
court
to
adopt.
and
if
that
if
that
interpretation
is
adopted,
it
makes
sense
of
this
statute.
if
this
statute
isn't
read
in
reference
to
the
violation
of
other
legal
duties,
than
it
covers
a
whole
range
of
conduct
that
is
unquestionably
innocent--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--section
1519,
i
don't
think
you
can.
could
you
have
done
that
in
the...
in
the
fall
of
2001?
yes,
your
honor,
you
could.
what
that
really
reflects
is
the
pettibone
rule.
the
pettibone
rule,
for
a
hundred
years,
was
that
destruction
and
other
kinds
of
acts
of
potential
obstruction
in
advance
of
a
proceeding
were
not
a
crime.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
they
certainly
hadn't
said
it
in
the
fall
of
2001,
your
honor.
and
so,
for
that
reason--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
they're
gonna...
if
they're
going
to
say
it,
though,
they
have
to
say
it
with
very
clear
language,
because,
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
fair
warning.
you
couldn't
conclude
from
the
language
of
the
witness-tampering
statute,
which
is
designed
to
protect
witnesses,
that
congress
had
made
all
record-retention
programs
unlawful.
i
also
think,
your
honor,
that
when
it
comes
time
to
construe
section
1519,
some
kind
of
nexus
will
have
to
be,
you
know,
reasonably
read
in
there,
because,
otherwise,
you
are
correct,
all
document
retention
policies,
or
virtually
all
of
them,
are
fatally
doomed.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
absolutely,
your
honor.
and,
in
this
case,
the
evidence
was
quite
clear
that,
you
know,
andersen
retained
its
work
papers,
and
the
work
papers
were
extremely
extensive,
and
they
were
required
to
fully
document
the
audit.
the
only
things
that
were
thrown
away
were
notes
and
preliminary
drafts,
which
had
already
been
incorporated,
in
effect,
into
the
final
conclusions
in
the
work
papers;
and
yet
that
was
the
whole
theory
of
this
case,
is
that
there
were
some
documents
that
were
destroyed.
they
were
precisely
the
kinds
of
documents
that
document-retention
policies
are
designed
to
eliminate,
in
part...
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
but,
in
part,
because
they
are
preliminary
in
character
and
they
can
be
misconstrued.
for
instance,
your
honor,
the
fbi
agents,
generally
speaking,
have
the
practice
of
not
keeping
their
notes
of
interviews.
they
take
those
notes,
they
make
a
file
memorandum,
they
throw
away
the
notes.
why
do
they
do
that?
of
course
they
know
the
defendant
would
love
to
have
those
notes
when
it
comes
time
for
a
trial.
they
do
it
because
they
feel
that
they
have
written
it
up
in
an
accurate
way,
and
enough's
enough.
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here,
your
honor.
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
language
of
1512
that
would
have
put
andersen
on
notice
that
its
document-retention
policy
was...
well,
in
fact,
the
government
doesn't
say
its
document
retention
was
a
crime;
it
says
it
wasn't
a
crime.
instead,
the
crime
was
when
david
duncan
asked
his
secretary
to
throw
away
documents
that
he
could
have
thrown
away,
lawfully,
himself.
this
statute
does
not
give
fair
warning
that
that--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor.
section
1519
did
not
get
passed
until
the
year
2002.
it
did
not
exist.
instead,
the
rule
that
was
in
force
then
was
the
pettibone
rule,
the
one
that's
reflected
in
the
text
of
section
1505;
and
that
is,
"the
proceeding
must
be
pending".
that's,
no
doubt,
why
the
government
didn't
charge
andersen
with
a
crime
under
section
1505.
i
mean,
they
make
it
sound
like
the
culpability
here
is
the
destruction
of
records.
well,
if
so,
then
you
would
think
that
they
would
have
charged
andersen
with
destroying
documents--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but
they
didn't.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
that...
no,
that's
just
15---
that's
1512,
for
witness
tampering.
but
for
the
act
of
destroying
documents
to
interfere
with
a
proceeding--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--that's
section
1505,
and
the
proceeding
must
be
pending.
and
that
is...
that
is
still
the
rule
today,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
if
a
proceeding
is...
yes,
we
would,
in
this
case.
yes,
absolutely.
but,
you
know,
if
a
proceeding
is
pending,
then
it
changed
the...
changes
the
way
that
you
apply
the
definition
of
"corruptly".
but
you're
certainly
right
that
the
definition
is
the
same.
the
question
is,
under
the
proper
definition
of
"corruptly",
did
you
induce
the
witnesses
to
engage
in
this
activity
through
improper
means,
such
as
bribery,
or
did
you
try
to
get
them
to
violate
their
independent
legal
duties?
for
instance,
if
they
had
duties,
under
section
1519,
not
to
destroy,
then
it
makes
perfect
sense,
because
what
you
have
done
is,
you
have
asked
the
witness
to
engage
in
conduct
which
violates
the
law,
and
that
corrupts
them,
it
harms
them,
it
fits
with
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
it
fits
with
the
structure.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
at
the
time
that
he
made
that
statement,
what
that
statement
actually
reflects
is
the
pettibone
rule.
he
was
accurate
in
his...
in
his
statement
about
what
the
law
was
governing
document
destruction
at
the
time.
that's
a
good-faith
reasonable
belief
that
was
absolutely
supported
by
the
law.
but,
more
importantly,
your
honor,
if
we
look
at
mr.
odom's
remarks,
he
wasn't
working...
he
wasn't...
this
wasn't
in
connection
with
the
enron
engagement;
there
were
only,
i
think,
ten
people,
out
of,
like,
80,
at
that
training
seminar
that
had
anything
to
do
with
enron.
he
was
talking
about
the
firm's
document-retention
policy.
the
jury
asked
to
see
that
videotape.
they
may
have
actually
convicted
andersen
based
upon
his
remarks
about
the
document-retention
policy.
they,
similarly,
may
have
convicted
andersen
based
upon
nancy
temple's
memos
that...
one
of
which
was
a
reminder
to
the
engagement
team
that
they
were
supposed
to
applying...
complying
with
the
document-retention
policy.
that's
legal
services.
this--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor,
it
was
just
a
training
session
that
was
just
a...
a
section
of
the
training
session.
it
has...
literally,
i
think
there
were
89
attendees,
only
about
ten
of
them--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor.
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
that's--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--no,
your
honor.
that
was
on
october
the
10th.
the
letter
did
not
come
until
october
the
17th.
andersen
learned
about
it
on
october
the
19th.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
please.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
first
address
the
fact
that
much
of
the
government's
argument
is
focused
on
this
nexus,
the
imminence
of
the
proceeding,
that
sort
of
thing,
but
actually
the
jury
was
not
required
to
find
any
nexus
whatsoever,
and
was
told
the
wrong
definition
of
an
"official
proceeding",
to
boot.
it
was
told
that
the
informal
inquiry
by
the
sec
staff
was
an
official
proceeding,
and
that
an
official
proceeding
was
already
going
on
at
the
time
of
the
events
at
issue
here;
in
fact,
even
before
nancy
temple
even
knew
about
that
informal
inquiry,
which,
in
and
of
itself,
is
reversible
error.
and--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
sec,
which
is
commenced
by
a
vote
of
the
commission
and
has
compulsory
process
available.
it
is
certainly
not
a
staff
person
sitting
in
their
office
in
houston
opening
a
file
and
doing
some
internet
searches.
that's
the
government's
definition.
that's
in...
a
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
an
agency,
and
that's
not
the
language
that
appears
in
this
statute.
also,
in
terms
of
whether
andersen
raised
this
argument,
of
course
they
did.
they
asked
for
an
instruction
that
the
proceeding
be
ongoing
or
scheduled,
because
that
was
fifth
circuit
law
at
the
time.
andersen
wasn't
supposed
to
guess
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
going
to
change
what
it
had
held
in
case
called
shively.
and
the
fifth
circuit
understood
that
andersen
had
preserved
the
argument,
and
expressly
says
in
its
opinion
that
the
issue
is,
what
is
the
concreteness
of
the
defendant's
expectation
of
a
proceeding
that
should
be
required
under
this
statute
+/?
and
found
that
"feared"
was
enough.
that's
not
enough.
"possible"
is
not
enough,
especially
if
a
broad
definition,
like
the
one
the
government
wants
to
have...
there's
got
to
be
a
serious
nexus.
nexus
problems
can
be
avoided,
though,
if
the
more
traditional
definition
of
1503.
as
i
read
to
you,
the
definitions
of
"corruptly"
are
completely
consistent
with
andersen's
definition.
the
government
says,
"oh,
no.
"
"in
fact,
all
it
meant
under
1503
was
an
intent
to
obstruct
justice.
"
that
can't
possibly
be
what
congress
intended
for
section
1512,
because
this
court
had
held,
for...
a
hundred
years
ago,
that
you
necessarily
lack
the
evil
intent
to
obstruct
if
a
proceeding
is
not
pending.
and
1512
does
apply
even
before
proceedings
begin,
so
the
definition
had
to
be
tailored
to
the
precise
circumstances
of
section
1512.
it
couldn't
import
the
precise
thing.
plus,
the
definition
under
1503
has
never
been
any
intent
to
impede
the
fact-finding
ability
is
a
prohibited
intent.
that
would
require
lawyers
and
clients
all
over
the
country
to
go
to
jail.
it's
that
you
intend
to
subvert
and
undermine
the
integrity
of
the
due
administration
of
justice.
and
that
term
does
not
mean
simply
to
impede
the
fact-finding;
it
means
that
you
intend
to
disobey
those
duties
that
are
imposed
upon
you
in
the
course
of
a
proceeding.
and
cases,
including
the
howard
case
cited
in
our
brief
and
cited
by
the
government,
make
that
crystal
clear.
it
is
not
translated
to
what
this
jury
instruction
was,
which
is
that...
any
intent
to
impede
fact-finding.
just
take
a
look
at
the
examples,
if
the
government
were
correct
about
this.
if
i
were
to
ask
my
lawyer
to
assert,
let's
say,
a
reporter's
privilege
that
is
debatable,
under
the
government's...
and
i
do
it,
because
i
know
that
that
document
is
harmful,
and
i
want
to
keep
it
out
of
the
proceeding...
under
the
government's
definition,
that
is
corrupt,
because
i
am
trying
to
get
another
person
to
withhold
a
document
in
order
to
impede
the
fact-finding
ability
of
the
decision-maker.
it
makes
no
sense
to
define
"corruptly"
that
way.
if
you,
instead,
define
it
with
reference
to
duties,
it
makes
perfect
sense.
that's
not
corrupt,
because
there
is
no
duty
to
provide
a
document
when
you
have
a
good-faith
claim
of
privilege.
thank
you,
your
honor.
