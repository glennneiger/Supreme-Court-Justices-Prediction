justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
you
persuaded...
and
i
know
that
is
not
this
case...
suppose
you
persuaded
the
person
to
destroy
the
documents
in
order
to
conceal
a
fraud.
would
that
be
corrupt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
order
to...
let's
say
it's
a
revenue
audit,
and
you
know
that
it's
a
fraud,
and
you
persuade
somebody
to
destroy
the
documents
in
order
to
conceal
the
fraud.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question
is,
does
that
give...
would
that
give
some
content
to
the
meaning
of
"corruptly",
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you're
anticipating
a
revenue
audit
from
the
internal
revenue
service
or
from
the
sec,
and
you
destroy
certain
documents
that
you're
not
required
to
keep,
but
that
would
make
the
officials'
task
easier;
he
you
could
perform
the
audit
in
just
a
couple
of
days,
instead
of...
it's
going
to
take
him
a
week.
can
you
make
it
harder
for
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is,
in
the
case,
this
lingering
feeling
that
something's
wrong
out
there.
i
know
that
we
don't...
we
don't
convict
people
on
that
basis;
we
require
something
more
specific.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
i
just
don't
like
the
irs,
and
i
know
they're
coming.
i
have
some
very
detailed
summaries
which
will
give
them
the
answer
they
need
right
away.
i
throw
away
those
summaries
and
make
them
go
back
to
the
original
records
just
to
make
it
tough
for
them.
can
i
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i...
just
to
make
it
clear,
i
take
it
you
would
still
have
the
same
objection
to
the
deficiency
of
the
corruption
instruction,
even
if
a
proceeding
were
pending,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
i
have
a
company
and
i
know
that
the
pattern
is,
i'm
going
to
be
audited
every
five
years
by
the
irs.
and
in
year
four,
i...
one
year...
one
year
before
the
investigation,
i
instruct
my
bookkeeping
staff,
"keep
everything
you
need
to
document
our
expenses,
but
destroy
everything
that's
remotely
related
to
that,
or
indirectly
related
to
that.
"
"give
them
just
a
clean,
simple
file.
"
"destroy
anything
that's...
all
supporting
documentation.
"
"give
them
what
they
need
and
what
they're
entitled
to
have,
but
nothing
else.
"
"and
step
up
that
policy,
because
they're
going
to
be
here
next
year.
"
under
your...
it
seems
to
me
that
that
violates
your
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
definition
of
irs
audit.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
sweeping
position,
which
will
cause
problems
for
every
major
corporation
or
small
business
in
this
country.
i
just...
i
just
don't
understand
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
like
in...
the
old...
the
rule
in
the
army,
"make
two
copies
of
everything
you
throw
out.
"
i
mean,
that's
what
they're
going
to
have
to
do.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you...
if
you
had
alleged
that
they
did
this
in
order
to
cover
up
a
fraud,
there
would
be
no
problem.
but
what
you're
doing
is
to
say
it's
illegal
to
do
what
every
other
company
in
the
country
can
do
if
they
don't
have
an
audit
immediately
on
the
horizon.
i
just
don't
understand
it.
