paul

does
that
reading
of
the
rule
require
that
a
decision
to
extend
the
time
be
set
forth
in
any
particular
form
of
order
or
any
written
document?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
they
internally
did
affirmatively
decide
to
extend
the
time,
but
they
just
didn't
enter
an
order.
would
that
count?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
they
called
counsel
and
said,
we've
decided
to
delay
extending
the
time?
would
that...
but
we're...
we're
going
to
extend
the
time,
but
we're
not
going
to
bother
to
enter
an
order.
would
that
constitute
an
extension?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
requires
a
written
document--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--saying
for
how
long
it's
going
to
be
extended?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
apparently
did
decide
to
extend
the
time
for
whatever
time
it
took
them
necessary
to
review
the
files
that
this
particular
judge
became
aware
of
during
this
period.
they
did,
in
fact,
extend
the
time
because
they
didn't
issue
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
opinion
of
judge
suhrheinrich...
i
forget
his
name...
explains
in
great
detail
why
he
thought
they
needed
more
time
before
the
mandate
issued.
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
explaining
why
he
extended
the
mandate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
she
interview
the...
the
petitioner
herself?
did
she
not
interview
the...
the
defendant
himself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
disagree
with
the
factual
point
that
i
think
one
of
the
opinions
made,
that
this
study
was
not,
in
fact,
known
to
exist
by
the
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
panel
who
decided
the
merits
of
the
case
before
the
petition
for
cert
was
filed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
to
how
serious
it
was.
i
understand.
but
do
you...
do
you
disagree
with
what
i
understood
to
be
a
representation
of
judge
suhrheinrich
that
he
did
not
know
about
this
study,
did
not
know...
it
had
not
gotten
into
the
record,
and
neither
did
anybody
else
on
the
panel,
even
though,
it
seems
to
me,
sort
of
strange
that
nobody
did
know
it?
i
have
to
confess
that.
but
do
you
dispute
the
factual
predicate
or
the
fact
that...
that
they
did
not
know
that
this
study
was
available?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let
me
ask
you
this.
why
should
not
the
proper
standard
of
being...
deciding...
the
court
of
appeals
panel
has
decided
a
case.
they...
they
learn
something
that
would
have
caused
them
to
come
to
a
different
conclusion
had
they
not...
had
they
known
it
in
time.
should
not
that
be
a
sufficient
reason
to
extend
the
7-day
period?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
does
it
have
to
be
miscarriage
of
justice?
they
just
say
we
goofed
for
an
inexcusable
reason.
we
now
realize
there's
something
very
important
we
failed
to...
failed
to
find
out.
we
now
know
it,
and
we
would
decide
the
case
differently
had
we
known
it
a
week
ago.
is
that
not
a
sufficient
reason
to
say
let's
postpone
the
7
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
asking
whether
if
you
were
on
the...
on
the
court
of
appeals,
wouldn't
you
think
that
would
be
a
sufficient
reason
to
say,
hey,
don't
issue
the
mandate?
hold
it
for
a
week
so
we
can
look
at
this.
you
don't
think
that
would
be
permissible
for
an
appellate
judge
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
isn't
it
also
true
that
in
calderon
the
court
didn't
merely
hold
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
they
held
it
was
a
grave
abuse
of
discretion,
but
even...
even
more
serious
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
that's
your
position,
but
has
any
judge
so
ruled
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
be
right.
in
this
case
did
any...
either
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
terminate
the
stay?
