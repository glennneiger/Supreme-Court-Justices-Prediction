where
does
it
say
earlier?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
court
can...
can
extend
it
or...
or
in
fact
truncate
it,
can't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
if
the
court
then...
i'm...
let
me
just
get
to...
and
i
think
this
is
consistent
with
justice
breyer's
question.
what
if
the
court,
at
the...
at
the
point
cert
was
denied
and
rehearing
was
denied,
simply
said,
i...
we're
now
operating
under
(b)
and
we're
extending
the
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh.
that's...
that's
what
it
did,
but
what
if
the
court
had...
had
been
more
articulate
about
what...
what
it...
it
was
doing
or
may
have
been
doing
and...
and
simply
said...
at
the
moment
at
which
the...
the
rehearing
period
expired
for
cert,
said,
all
right,
we're
still
not
issuing
the
mandate
and
we're
operating
under
subsection
(b),
we're
extending
the
time?
would...
is...
is
there
anything
in
the
rule
that,
at
least
in
terms,
would
have
precluded
the
court
from
doing
that
if
it
had
said
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
wasn't
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
that...
that
may
be
but
the...
the
fact
that
this
sort
of
evidence
would
ultimately
be
kept
out
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
ultimately
from
the
district
court
may
be
a
very
good
reason
for
us
not
to
adopt
your
analysis
that
what
happened
here
is
the
equivalent
of
a
mandate
issuing
and
a
mandate
being
recalled.
it
may
be
a
very
good
reason
to
prefer
a
different
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
we...
we
don't
have
to
conclude
why
it
was
not
presented.
all
we
have
to
be
concerned
with
or
what,
i
think,
we
have
to
be
concerned
with
is
this.
is
this
very
important
evidence?
the
answer
is
yes.
it
may
not
go
to
eligibility,
but
it's
very
significant.
number
two,
if
we
accept
your
calderon
analysis,
this
evidence
will
be
kept
out
forever.
if
it's
that
important,
that
may
be
a
good
reason
not
to
accept
your
calderon
analysis
and
say
if
the
mandate
hasn't
issued,
it
hasn't
issued.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's
my
point
and...
and
you
may
want
to
respond
to
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i
take
it
you
also
recognize
that
the
bridge
that
we
did
not
cross
in
calderon
was...
#
was
in
answering
the
question
whether...
in
a
case
in
which
a
court
does
not
issue
the
mandate,
we
are
going
to
construe
the
court's
authority,
its...
its
discretion
narrowly
or
broadly.
and
that
is
the
issue
before
us
here,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
were...
were
those
cases
in
which
they
issued
an
order
saying
what
they
were
doing?
i.
e.,
we
extend
under
(b)?
