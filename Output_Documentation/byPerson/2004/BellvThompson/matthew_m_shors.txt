mr.
matthew
m.
shors
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
it
relinquished
jurisdiction
over
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
engaged
in
sua
sponte
reconsideration
to
correct
a
clear
error
in
its
prior
decision
which
called
into
question
the
reliability
of
mr.
thompson's
death
sentence.
that--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--your
honor,
if
the
court
is
acting
pursuant
to
41(b),
which
we
believe
can
occur
without
a
formal
stay
order,
it...
it
can
do
that
at
any
time
before
it
issues
the
mandate.
we're
unaware
of
circumstances
in
which
that's
extended
for
indefinite
periods
of
time,
and
i
think
this
case
is
a
perfect
illustration
as
to
why.
this
is
a--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
(d)(2)(d)
sets
forth
the
endpoint
of
a
stay
entered
pending
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court.
that
is
not
the
only
reason
a
court
of
appeals
may
stay
or
delay
issuance
of
its
mandate.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
other
sections
of
the
rule,
(d)(1)
affirmatively
sets
forth
a
separate
basis
for
staying
issuance
of
the
mandate
if
there
is
a
petition
for
rehearing
filed.
and
the
mere
fact
that
you
could
have
competing
stays
in
a
case
we
think
illustrates
the
incorrectness
of
the
state's
view
that
(d)(2)(d)
eclipses
everything
else
and
requires
issuance
of
the
mandate
under
all
circumstances.
the
ultimate
power
at
issue
in
this
case
is
rule
41(b)
which
gives
the
court
the
power
to
shorten
or
extend
the
time
for
which
to
issue
its
mandate.
as
we've
set
forth
in
the
brief,
there
are
all
kinds
of
reasons
why
a
court
of
appeals
may
occasionally
continue
to
do
that
beyond
the
denial
of
certiorari
review
by
this
court.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
justice
scalia,
it
was
proper
for
several
reasons.
first,
rule
41(b)
does
not
require
a
court
order.
unlike
other
provisions
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
including
rule
40,
it
simply
says,
may
extend
or
shorten
the
time.
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
rule,
one
of
the
reasons
the
advisory
committee
specifically
rejected
a
reading
of
rule
41(c)
that
would
have
made
the
mandate
effective
when
it
should
have
issued
is
that
you
can
never
know
from
looking
at
the
docket
alone
whether
the
non
issuance
of
the
mandate
was
because
of
a
clerical
error
or
because
of
a
judge's
intervention
in
the
case.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
good
practice,
justice
kennedy,
but
it
is
consistent
with
the
rule.
and
their
attack
on...
on
rule
41
in
this
case
is
an
attack
on
the
general
authority
of
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
absolutely
it
is,
justice
kennedy,
because
as
i
noted,
the
rule
doesn't
say
by
order.
the
practice--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--your
honor,
there
are
cases
we've
cited
and
rules
where
the
question
comes
up,
does
there
have
to
be
a
formal
order
entered.
we've
cited
the
sparks
case,
the
alphin
case,
and
the
first
gibraltar
case.
and...
and
there
are
some
cases
in
which,
following
the
denial
of
certiorari,
courts
of
appeal
continue
to
engage
in
reconsideration
of
the
matter.
we
think
that's
what
happened
in
the
fairchild
case
cited
in
the...
in
the
red
brief,
and
to
a
lesser
extent,
it's
what
happened
in
the
muntaqim
case
coming
out
of
the
second
circuit.
and
the
reason
is--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--justice
souter,
in
the
sparks
case,
as
well
as
in
the
rivera
case,
no,
there
was
no
such
order.
and
what
the
sparks
court
said,
reading
rule
(b)
correctly
we
believe,
is
there's
no
provision
in
rule
41(b)
that
requires
a
formal
order.
that's
what's
set
forth
in
(d)
in
response
to
motions.
and
the
reason
is
a
case
is
not
final
until
the
court
of
appeals
issues
its
mandate.
and
so
the
burden
is
on
the
litigant--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--justice
ginsburg,
it
has
some
effects,
but
the...
the
critical
point
for
this
case
is
the
power
to
reconsider
is
not
eclipsed
until
the
mandate
issues.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
forman
v.
united
states,
and
we
think
it's
what
the
advisory
committee
notes
of
rule
35
and
40
indicate.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
mr.
chief
justice,
the...
the
state
was
effectively
notified
when
the
mandate
did
not
issue.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
well,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--it...
it
could
be
a
clerical
error,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
we...
we
think
that's
exactly
why
the
advisory
committee
note...
notes
indicate
that
an
attorney
who
believes
that
a
mandate
should
have
issued
should
confirm
that
he
or
she
has
secured
a
final
judgment
before
assuming
that
the
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
over
a
case
is
completed.
that
didn't
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
for...
for
purposes
of
appeal,
that...
that
would
be
true,
but
in...
in
this
case,
as
we
think
the
advisory
committee
notes
made
clear,
the...
the
burden
is
on
the
party,
seeking
to
secure
a
final
judgment,
to
confirm
that
a
mandate
has
issued.
in
fact,
in--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--justice
o'connor--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--justice
o'connor,
the...
the
panel
did
get
the
decision
right
in
the
second
case,
and
it
did
so
in
response
to
a
thorough
review
of
the
entire
record.
courts
of
appeal
frequently
engage
in
reconsideration
without
requiring
additional
briefing
and--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--cert.
was
denied
on
december
1st
and
the
second
opinion
was
june
23rd.
so
it
was
a
period
of
about
6
and
a
half
months.
it's
less
than
that
if
you
consider
that
there
was
a
second
petition
to
stay
the
mandate
filed
and
granted,
which
didn't
expire
until
january
23rd
when
the
court
of
appeals
received
word
that
this
court
had
also
denied
a
petition
for
rehearing.
we
think
that
in
any
case
the
burden
is
on
a
litigant
seeking
to
secure
a
final
judgment
and
to
ensure
that
the
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
over
a
case
has
ended.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
justice
breyer,
our
understanding
is
that
the
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
circuits,
including
the
decision
below,
have
all
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ultimate
decision
of
when
to
issue
the
mandate
lies
within
the
broad
discretion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
that...
that
occasionally
happens,
and...
and
there
are
some
cases
clearly
where
there
is
a
formal
stay
order
in
place
if
the
court
is
acting
pursuant
to
(d),
which
we--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--justice
scalia,
it...
we're
not...
it's
not
regular
practice.
it
does
happen,
and
the
reason
it
happens,
as
we've
set
forth
in
the
brief,
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
court's
decision
to
deny
review.
there
are
instances,
which
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
in
which
following
the
denial
of
certiorari
review,
a
court
of
appeals
recognizes
the
clear
error
of
its
prior
decision.
the
question
in
this
case
is
does
it
have
to
send
out
that
decision
even
though
it
realizes
it's
in
clear
error.
and
the
other
reason
it
sometimes
happens
over
a
period
of
time
is
that
reconsideration,
much
like
the
initial
decision-making
process,
is
a
fluid
process.
rules
35
and
40
give
the
court
sua
sponte
the
power
to
engage
in
reconsideration,
and
that's
exactly
the
power
the
court
exercised
in
this
case.
there
are
particular
reasons
in
this
case,
as
the
panel
noted,
that
there
was
no
unfair
surprise
to
the
state
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor.
first,
the
state
took
dr.
sultan's
deposition
in
july
of
1999.
the
briefing
on
that
subject
was...
was
a
matter
of
days
following
that
deposition,
and
as
the
panel
correctly
noted,
there
was
no
unfair
surprise
to
the
state.
the
critical,
factual
issue
in
this
case
was
as
the
result
of
egregious
attorney
malfeasance
not
included
in
the
district
court
record.
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
was
unfair
surprise.
the
court
of
appeals
called
for
the
record
back
from
the
district
court
after
it
had
otherwise
finished
with
the
case
and
while
cert
was
pending.
that
was
reflected
in
the
docket
sheet,
and
we've
cited
that
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
8.
there
was--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--mr.
chief
justice,
at
a
minimum,
an
attorney
seeking
to
secure
a
final
judgment
should
check
the
docket
sheet
to
ensure
that
a
mandate
has
issued
in
accordance
with
when
the
practitioner
believes
the
mandate
should
have
issued.
that's
exactly
what
the
advisory
committee--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
so.
it's
not
that
one
reason.
it's
a
combination
of
reasons.
if
you
consider
the
fact
that
the
state
was
aware
it
had
benefitted
from
a
clear
factual
error
with
the
fact
that
the
docket
was
returned
to
the
court
of
appeals
reflected
on
the
docket
sheet,
with
the
fact
that
the
state
itself
initiated
collateral
litigation
in
the
fall
of
2003
to
preclude
the
federal
public
defenders
office
from
representing
mr.
thompson
in
the
state
court
competency
proceedings.
and
even
their
brief,
the
wolfel
case
that
they
cite
says
that
alone
might
be
a
reason
a
court
of
appeals
might
want
to
hold
onto
its
mandate
because
it
was
an
issue
that
was
immediately
relevant
on...
on
remand
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
justice
scalia,
i
don't
believe
it's
a
technical
difference.
this
court
has
always
drawn
a
sharp
distinction
between
a
court's
ability
to
grab
back
a
case
from
another
court
after
that
case
has
passed
beyond
its
authority
to...
as
opposed
to
reconsidering
it
before
ever
relinquishing
jurisdiction
over
a
case.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that
even
the
state's
view
would
affect
this
court's
doctrine
about
what
happens
to
the
mandate
if
the
court
grants
cert
because
they're
only
talking
here
about
cases
in
which
cert
is
denied.
the
denial
of
cert
is
not
a
final
decision
on
the
merits,
and
there
are
reasons,
as
we've
cited
in
the
brief,
for
reconsideration
sometimes
continued
after
that.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
mandate
was
stayed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
if...
if...
i
think
it's
pretty--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--if
the
mandate
hadn't
been
issued,
then
i
think
no
matter
how
the
court
decides
this
case,
that
depending
on
the
circumstances,
the
court
of
appeals
might
be
able
to
alert
this
court
to
a...
a
change
in
the
facts
that
might
lead
this
court
to
dismiss
the
petition
as
improvidently
granted.
these
are
not
things
that
happen
all
the
time.
they
are
things
that
sometimes
happened.
and
i
did
want
to
get
back
to
the
final
reason
i
think
that
the
state
was
not
the
victim
of
unfair
surprise
in
this
case,
and
that
is
there
was
a
federal
court
stay
of
execution
in
this
case.
the
state
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
the
importance
of
securing
a
final
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
before
returning
to
state
court.
and
as
this
court
held
in
calderon,
this
court
rejected
the
state's
view
that
a
federal
habeas
appeal
is
final
when
cert
is
denied.
that
was
the
view
of
the
state
of
california
in
that
case.
this
court
instead
specifically
tied
the
state's
interest
in
finality
to
issuance
of
the
appellate
court
mandate.
that's
consistent
with
the
unbroken
history,
we
think,
of
drawing
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
moment
at
which
the
court
of
appeals
relinquishes
jurisdiction
over
a
case
and
permitting
the
court
to
correct
errors
before
then.
in
fact,
this
court
also
in
calderon
specifically
noted
that
it
was
not
a
case
where
the
mandate
had
been
stayed
pursuant
to
a
(d)(1)
motion.
there
is
no
reason
to
distinguish
a
case
involving
the
non-issuance
of
a
mandate
under
rule
41(b)
from
a
case
involving
a
stay
of
the
mandate
under
rule
(d)(1).
those
are
both
circumstances
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
still
has
the
case,
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
still
has
the
case
and
recognizes
a
clear
error
in
its
prior
decision
or
wishes
to
apply
a
new
precedent
to
its
decision
or
discovers
that
new
evidence
bears
on
a
question,
it
has
wide
discretion
to
reconsider
that
judgment
before
relinquishing
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
mr.
chief
justice,
we're
not
saying
that
this
power
is
plenary.
it
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
there
would
have
to
be
a
reason
for
doing
so.
if
the
court
sua
sponte
decided
it
had
reached
the
wrong
result
and
wished
to
reconsider
it,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
rule
41(b)
that
would
forbid
it.
that
does
occasionally
happen
in
en
banc
cases,
and
those
are
salutary
appellate
practices.
if,
for
an
example,
there's
a
national
security
case
or
some
other
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
resolves
it
and
denies
an
en
banc
petition
without
prejudice,
thinking
that
it's
an
important
enough
case
that
it
should
come
immediately
to
this
court,
there's
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
the
court
of
appeals
reconsidering
en
banc
the
decision
if
this
court
denies
review.
those
are
the
kinds
of
circumstances
that...
that
happen
that
are
good
appellate
practices--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but...
but
we
think
that
the
fact
that
this
is
a
single
judge
changing
his
mind
is
exactly
why
there
is
no
abuse
and
why
this
isn't
a
case
like
calderon
where
the
full
court
stepped
in
2
days
before
the
execution.
this
is
a
case
where
the
same
three
judges
who
denied
all
habeas
relief
and
denied
rehearing
came
back
later
and
said,
you
know
what?
we
made
a
serious
mistake.
mr.
thompson
deserves
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
test
the
reliability
of
his
death
sentence.
those
are
not
circumstances
unlike
recall
of
the
mandate
by
a
full
court
of
appeals--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
that's
a
reason
that
it
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
fix
that
error.
the
state
makes
a...
a
lot
of
an
issue
in
their
reply
brief
of
a
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
gotten
this
right
the
first
time.
that
is
exactly
why
we
have
reconsideration.
that
is
a
quintessential
illustration
of
why
reconsideration
is
a
good
idea.
the
court
should
have
gotten
something
right
the
first
time,
didn't,
recognizes
its
error,
and
while
it
still
has
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
fixes
that
error.
i
think
far
from
showing
it's
an
abuse
of--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
that
the
calderon
standard
should
not
be
applied
for
several
reasons.
first,
that
this
is
a...
a
challenge
to
a
rule
of
general
application,
rule
41.
there
is
no
explanation
in
the
state's
brief,
and
indeed
their
amicus
concedes
that...
that
our
reading
of
rule
41(b)
is
consistent
with
aedpa.
it
is
basically...
reconsideration
is
permitted
by
federal
law,
and
the
only
question
is
whether
the
state's
interest
in
finality
becomes
somehow
more
significant
the
moment
this
court
denies
certiorari.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
justice
scalia,
that's--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
a
little
different
only
because
in
calderon
it
was
only
an
inherent
power
question,
and
this
court
read
the
exercise
of
that
inherent
power
in
light
of
aedpa.
this
case
involves
a
rule
of
general
application
that
authorizes
a
practice.
and
the...
the
proper
standard
of
review
for...
for
that
practice
is
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
absolutely
would
vary
depending
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
a
case.
and
if
it
appeared
that
a
particular
exercise
of
rule
41(b)
power
was
contrary
to
aedpa,
it
would
surely
be
an
abuse
of
the
court's
discretion.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
absolutely,
justice
stevens,
and...
and
the
court's
opinion
suggests
that
even
if
it
hadn't
applied
the
miscarriage
of
justice
standard,
it
would
have
had
grave
doubts
about
the
exercise
of
that
power
precisely
because
it
involved
the
extraordinary
circumstance
of
reaching
out
and
taking
the
case
back
from
the
state
court
system.
the...
the
fact
that
the
federal
stay
of
execution
was
in
place
i
think
is
especially
important
to...
in
addressing
the
state's
argument,
that
there
was
nothing
preventing
the
state
from
going
back
and--
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
--justice
kennedy,
it
did
set
an
execution
date
but
it
was
not
informed
either
that
the
mandate
hadn't
issued
or
that
there
was
a
federal
court
stay
in
place.
in
a
decision
in
which
both
of
those
two
facts
were
brought
to
its
attention,
the
alley
case,
which
we
cite
in
the
red
brief,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
refused
to
set
an
execution
date,
ruling
that
it
was
premature.
and
that's
consistent
with
28
u.s.c.,
section
2251,
which
says
that
if
there's
a
federal
court
stay
of
execution
in
place,
any
execution
date
set
by
the
state
court
is
null
and
void.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
the
district
court
on
february
17th
of
2000
had...
had
granted
the
stay.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
it
remained
in
effect.
the...
the
fifth
circuit
has
come
to
that
conclusion
that...
that
if...
unless
the
court
of
appeals
takes
a
contrary
action
or
this
court
takes
a
contrary
action
vacating
the
stay,
that
stay
remains
in
place
until
the
case
is
out
of
the
federal
court
system.
because
this
case
never
became
final,
as
the
advisory
committee
notes
made
clear...
and
we
think
that
the
cases
that
we've
cited
in
the
brief
are
largely
undisputed
on
this
point...
a
court
of
appeals
decision
is
not
final
until
it
issues
its
mandate.
even
the
state
in
the
blue
brief
concedes
that's
true.
and
so
the
question
in
this
case
really
is,
if
you
still
have
jurisdiction
over
a
case,
under
what
circumstances
can
you
correct
an
error?
and
i
think
the
miscarriage
of
justice
standard
is
just
way
too
harsh
of
a
test
under
the
circumstances
because
this
case
is
a
perfect
illustration.
there
are
overwhelmingly
persuasive
reasons
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
fixed
its
mistake
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
justice
scalia,
that's
true,
but
that
imposes
a
burden
under
rule
41(b)
that
simply
does
not
exist
in
the
text
of
the
rule.
the
rule
does
not
say
by
order.
previous
versions
of
the
rule
did.
other
rules
in
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
do,
and
to
graft
that
onto
it,
despite
the
absence
of
that
language
and
an
understanding
that
that's
how
courts
given
the
ministerial
function
of...
of
issuing
mandates
do
their
practice
would
be
unfair.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
rule
does
permit
this
practice,
and
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
rule,
it
makes
it
even
more
clear.
the...
the
advisory
committee
rejected
a
rule,
akin
to
what
the
state
is
arguing
today,
that
a
mandate
should
be
effective
when
it
should
have
issued.
and
the
reason
they
denied
that
rule
was
because
you
can't
tell
from
looking
at
the
docket
whether
the
reason
is
a
clerical
error
or
the
act
of
a
judge
delaying
issuance
in
the
mandate.
that
alone
makes
clear
that
the
committee
had
in
mind
circumstances
in
which
judges
would
delay
issuing
their
mandates
without
issuing
formal
orders
to
that
effect.
numerous
courts
of
appeals
have
come
to
that
conclusion,
and
we
think
that's
entirely
consistent
with
the
rules,
in
addition
to
the
reasons
i...
i
stated
earlier,
that
i
think
in
this
case
particularly,
there
were
reasons
that
the
state
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
court
was
engaged
in
sua
sponte
reconsideration
of
its
decision.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
matthew
m.
shors
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
