ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
sixth
circuit
withdrew
its
judgment
affirming
the
denial
of
habeas
corpus
relief
6
months
after
this
court
denied
certiorari
review,
it
exceeded
its
authority
to
act
under
both
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure
and
this
court's
decision
in
calderon
v.
thompson.
as
to
the
rules,
rule
41(d)(2)(d)
requires,
without
exception,
that
the
court
issue
a
mandate
immediately
upon
the
filing
of
an
order
of
this
court
denying
certiorari.
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
but
because
the
court
had
no
discretion
under
the
rule
to
do
anything
other
than
to
issue
that
mandate,
its
subsequent
action
withdrawing
its
judgment
was
tantamount
to
a
recall
of
the
mandate,
which,
under
this
court's
precedent
in
calderon,
cannot
be
justified
in
this
case
because
the
evidence
simply
does
not
support
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
which
under
calderon
means
actual
innocence
of
the
offense
or
actual
innocence
of
the
death
penalty.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor,
we
don't
read
rule
41(b)
as
allowing
any
sort
of
recall
authority.
rule
41(b)--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
mandate
was
not
recalled--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--because
it
was
never
issued.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor,
that
is
not...
not
the
rule
applicable
here
because
that
rule
applies
in
a
different
context.
that
applies
at
an
earlier
stage
of
the
post-judgment
proceeding.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
rule
41(b)
specifically
deals
with
the
7-day
period
of...
of
time
for
issuance
following
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
a
petition
for
rehearing
or
the
disposition
of
that
petition
for
rehearing.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
it
can,
your
honor,
at
that
point.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
because
the
more
specific
provision...
what
the
court
had
actually
done
was
to
stay
the
mandate
pending
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
the...
the--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--i
think
that
simply
a
plain
reading
of
the
rule
and
looking
at
the
rule
as
a
whole
would
preclude
that
result.
and
the
reason
is
that
the...
the
specific
language
that...
that
your
honor
is
referring
to
speaks
in
terms
of
shortening
or
extending
the
time,
the
time
being
the
7-day
period
for
issuance.
that
7-day
period
is
simply
a
period
to
allow
the
clerk
a
window
of
time
to
get
the
mandate
out
after
the
rehearing
period
has
expired
or
after
the
rehearing
has
been
disposed
of.
but
it
does
not
give
the
court
carte
blanche
to
simply
withhold
the
mandate.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
that...
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
the
court--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--after
the--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--after
the
denial
of
cert,
your
honor?
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
the--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
rule
does
not
allow
for
that
withholding
of
the
mandate.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
if
the--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--if
the
mandate
has
been
stayed
pending
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
that
petition
has
been
denied,
the
rule
requires
the
immediate
issuance.
now,
there...
there
may
be
and...
and--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
the
mandate
should
have
issued--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--that
was
in
excess
of
the
court's
authority
under
the
rules.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
in
our
view
the
rule
does
not
allow
any
other
circumstances.
rule
41
does
not
allow
any
other
circumstances.
if
that
authority--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
state
did
not
object
to
the...
to
the
extension,
your
honor,
because
the...
the
mandate
was
of
no
consequence
to
the
state
in
terms
of
the
state's
actual...
a
state
court
proceedings.
the
state
did
not
need
the
mandate
to
go
forward
with
its
proceedings,
and
in
fact,
the
state
was
not
authorized
under
state
law
to
even
seek
an...
an
execution
date
until
the
time
had
expired
for
rehearing.
so--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
court
simply
ignored
the...
the...
the
process
of...
of
the
case...
the
extension
ability
in
subsection
(b)
was
never
invoked
by
the
court.
there
was
a
timely
petition
for
rehearing
filed,
which
automatically
stayed
the
mandate
under
subsection
(d)(1).
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
never
invoked
subsection
(b)
as
authority
for
exaction.
after...
when
the
petition
for...
for
rehearing
was
denied,
the
7-day
period
in
subsection
(b)
then
came
into
play.
the
petitioner,
or
the...
the
petitioner
below,
mr.
thompson,
filed
a
motion
to
withhold
the
matter,
stay
the
mandate
pending
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
and
that
was--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--that
is
our
reading
of
the
rule,
yes,
sir.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
it's
our...
it's
our
reading
of
the
rule
that...
that
the
language
employed
in
subsection
(b)
implies
some
affirmative
action
of...
of
the
court.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
a
court
in...
in
our
view--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--i
don't
think
that
would
constitute
an
extension.
i
think
the
language
in
subsection
(b)
requires
some--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--some
affirmative
order--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--some
affirmative
order
of
the
court
not
only
saying
we're
going
to
extend
the...
the
time,
but
to
give
an
alternative
time.
that...
subsection
(b)
does
not
allow
for...
for
an
indefinite
withholding
of
a
mandate.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
all
this
record
shows,
your
honor,
is
that
the
mandate
did
not
issue.
so
the
reason
for
that
is...
is
not--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
order
in
this
record
explaining
why
the
mandate
did
not
issue.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor,
i
believe
that
a
single
judge
would
have
the
authority
to
extend
the
mandate,
but
a
single
judge
would
not
have
the
authority
to
grant
rehearing
because
that
would
be
a
determination
of...
of
the
case.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
it
is
an
unusual
situation,
your
honor,
but
the
court
did
more
than
simply
write
an
opinion.
the
court
entered
a
judgment
on
that
opinion,
and
that
judgment
became
final
and
became
the
final
word
of
the
court
upon
entry--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
court
always
have
the...
the
safety
valve
of...
of
its
recall
power
under
extraordinary
circumstances.
now,
in
a
habeas
case,
that
extraordinary
circumstance
has
to
be
more
than
just
this...
for
some
reason,
i
overlooked
this.
and...
and
bear
in
mind
as
well
that
this
evidence
was
in
front
of
the
court.
judge
suhrheinrich
had
this
deposition
for
21
months
before
that
first
opinion
was
entered
and
that
first
judgment
was
entered.
so
this
was
not
something--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--that's
precisely
what
the
court
should
have
done
in
this
case,
your
honor,
in...
in
our
view.
the
mandate
was
required
to
issue
and
then
the
court
should
have
looked
at
this
extraordinary
circumstance,
this...
this
unusual
circumstance,
and
made
the
determination
under
calderon
whether
that
met
the
standard
for
a
miscarriage
of
justice
under
the
habeas
decisions
of
this
court,
specifically
calderon.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor,
we
have
not
done
that
type
of...
of
inventory.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--your
honor,
our
response
to
that
is...
is
twofold.
number
one,
i
don't
think
that...
that
the
rules
of...
of
appellate
procedure
can
be
abrogated
by
the
consensus
of
the
circuits.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
if
the
circuits
are
not
complying
with
the
plain
language
of
the
rule,
then...
then,
yes,
they
have.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
this
is
an
unusual
case
in
the
way
that
it's
set
out
in
judge
suhrheinrich's
opinion,
your
honor.
but
if
you
look
at
it
and...
and
look
at
it
in
the
way
that...
that
it
should
have
played
out...
and
the
way
it
should
have
played
out
was
that
the
mandate
should
have
issued
after
this
court
denied
cert.
this
court
then
went
on
after
that
to
deny
rehearing
and
the
state
moved
forward.
if
at
that
point
judge
suhrheinrich
looked
at
this
deposition
and
believed
that
it
established
or
showed
an
extraordinary
circumstance,
than
a
recall
would...
would
have
occurred,
and
then
that
would
have
been
an
issue.
but
if
you
look
at
the
evidence
itself,
it
simply
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of...
of
extraordinary
circumstances.
it
does
not
show
actual
innocence
of
the
offense.
gregory
thompson
has
all
along
admitted
that
he
committed
this
offense.
there
was
no
defense
of
it
at
trial.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
assuming
there
is
an
extraordinary
circumstance,
i
think
to
prevent
the
result
of
having
to
issue
and
then
immediately
recall,
i
think
the
court
in
that
circumstance,
assuming
there
was
actually
an
extraordinary
circumstance,
actual
innocence
of
the
offense
or
actual
innocence
of
the
death
penalty,
which
we
don't
think
was
shown
in
this
case...
what
the
court
could
do
in
our
view
is
to
invoke
its
authority
under
rule
2
to
suspend
the
rules
for
good
cause.
and
in
that
circumstance,
given
the
finality
of
the
judgment,
the
good
cause
must
rise
to
the
level
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice
under
calderon.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
i
think
that's
one
interpretation
of
the
rule,
your
honor.
we
read
that...
the
rule
a
little
bit
stricter
than
that,
and
we
limit
that
extension
in
our
reading
to
the
7-day
period
after
the
expiration
of
the
time
to
seek
rehearing
or
the
denial.
but
i
think
that
that
is
a...
that
is
a
reading--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--we
read
the
rule
(b),
the
extension
period--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--to
be
limited
to
the
7-day
period
after
the
expiration
of
the
time
to
seek
rehearing
or
the
disposition
of
the
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
or
by
panel
or
the
disposition
of
a
motion
to
stay
the
mandate.
we
limit
that
to...
that
interpretation
to
a
different
phase
of
the
proceeding.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
it...
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
i
would
like
to
address
that,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that...
that
the
seriousness
of
this
evidence
has
been
vastly
overstated
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit.
the
evidence
itself
was...
was
quite
simply
a
deposition
of
a
clinical
psychologist
who
opined
based
on
her...
some
additional...
some
additional
meetings
with
family
members
and
a
review
of
the
transcripts
and
other
evidence
that
the
petitioner
suffered
from
a
mental
illness
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
she
did.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
she
conducted
some...
some--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--yes,
she
did,
your
honor,
but
her
ultimate
opinion
was
couched
in
the
language
of
tennessee's
statutory
mitigating
circumstance,
that...
that
mr.
thompson
at
the
time
of
the
offense
suffered
from
a
mental
illness
or
defect
that...
that
impaired
his
ability
to...
to
conform
his
conduct
to
the
requirements
of
the
law,
but
that
was
not
sufficient
to
meet
the
legal
definition
of
insanity.
that
is
the...
that
is
the...
exactly
the
language
under
tennessee's
mitigator
that...
that
dr.
sultan's
opinion
was
specifically
limited
to.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor,
there
is
a
disagreement
in
the
opinion
itself
that--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--judge
suhrheinrich
represented
that
he
was
unaware
of
the
deposition,
and
i
have
no
way
to
dispute
that
except
to
say...
i
have
no
way
to
dispute
his
own
personal
representation.
but
judge
moore
pointed
out
in
the
majority
opinion
that
the
deposition
was,
in
fact,
before
the
court
and
had
been
presented
for...
21
months
earlier
than
the
initial
opinion
was
entered.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
it
was
a
deposition.
it
was
attached
to
a
motion
to
hold
the
appeal
in
abeyance
pending
the
disposition
of
a
rule
60
motion
in
the
district
court.
that's
how
it
came
before
the...
before
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
it
was...
it
was
before
the
court
by
way
of
that
motion.
it
was
not
properly
in
the
record.
but
then
again,
it
was
not
any
more
proper
to
consider
after
its
opinion
than
it
was
to
consider
before
it--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--it
was
quoted
in
the
petition
for
rehearing.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
it
was
directly
quoted.
the
ultimate
opinion,
with
regard
to
the
mitigator,
was
directly
quoted.
but
the...
the
point
that
i
was
making
earlier,
this
deposition
in
no
way
renders
the...
the
defendant
ineligible
for
the
death
penalty
because
it
does
not
undermine
any
of
the
three
aggravating
circumstances.
it
does
not
even
make
a
prima
facie
showing
of
insanity
under
tennessee
law,
as
i've
stated
earlier.
it
simply
tracked
the
mitigating
circumstance
under
the
statute,
and
as
this
court
held
in
sawyer
v.
whitley,
simply
additional
mitigating
circumstances
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
innocence
of
the
death
penalty.
so
it
neither...
it
demonstrates
neither
innocence
of
the...
the
offense
or
of
the
death
penalty.
and
even
more
so
than
that,
it
would
not
have
even
defeated--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--your
honor,
i
think
it
would
have
been
one
element
of...
that...
that
may
have
been
considered.
but
in
terms
of
the
extraordinary
circumstance,
innocent
of
the
death
penalty
or
innocence
of
the
offense,
it
would
not
rise
to
that
level.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
that's...
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
in
sawyer
v.
whitley,
this
court
specifically
said
that
and
rejected
the...
the
contention
that
additional
mitigation...
mitigating
evidence
would
render
a
defendant
ineligible
of
the
death
penalty.
so
this
does
not
satisfy
the
actual
innocence
extraordinary
circumstances.
nor
would
it
have--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--your
honor,
we...
we...
it
would
be
mere
speculation
to...
for...
for
this
court
or
any
court
to...
to
conclude
why
this
evidence
was
not
presented
to
the
district
court.
there
are
any
number
of
reasons.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
your
honor,
my
response
to
that
is
it
is
not
that
important,
and
when
i
say
that,
it
is
not
that
important
because
it
would
not
even
have
defeated
summary
judgment.
the--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--that
is
precisely
the
argument
that
we
are
making,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
it
is,
your
honor.
the
issue
here
is...
is
whether
calderon
extends
to
this
situation.
we
think
it
does.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
that
is
what
we're
saying,
your
honor,
because
the
effect
on
the
state
of
tennessee
is
precisely
the
same.
the
finality
is
the
same.
the
judgment
was...
was
entered
and
final
at
the
point
that
the
court
entered
it
the
first
time
in
january
of
2003.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
be
a
sufficient
reason,
your
honor,
because--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
extension
period--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--if
the
court
felt...
the
7-day
period
is
not
to
allow
the
court
to
rehear
the
case.
if
the
court
wishes
to
invoke--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--a
rehearing--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--that
would
not
be
permissible.
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
extension.
it
is
not
to
allow
a
court
to
continue
to
mull
over
a
case
once
a
final
judgment
has
been
entered.
the
mandate
is
not
the
judgment.
the
judgment
is
the
decision
of
the
court,
and
once
the...
the
court
has
affirmed
that
judgment,
the
judgment
dismissing,
denying
habeas
relief,
the
state's
interests
become
paramount.
particularly
at
the
point
when
this
court
has
denied
cert,
all
avenues
of
review
have
been
exhausted,
the
state
at
that
point
ought
to
be
able
to
rely
on
the
finality
and
ought
to
be
able
to
rely
on
a
court
to
comply
with
the
plain
language
of
the
rules
that
govern
it.
if
any...
if
any
body
should
be...
should
be
bound
by
the
rules,
it
should
be
a
court,
and
they
should
not
be
able
to
be
abrogated
by
some
consensus
or
just
the
fact
that
courts
don't
ordinarily
follow
them
or...
or
may
or
may
not
think
that...
that
it's
appropriate
under
a
particular
circumstance.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?

just
briefly
responding
to
the
question
of
the
stay
of
execution
under
section
2251,
there
was
a
stay
of
execution
extended
by
the
district
court
pending
the
disposition
of
appeal...
of
the
appeal,
but
appeals
are
disposed
of
by
judgments,
and
that
judgment
was
entered
in
january
of
2003.
the
state
had
a
judgment
which
was
final.
the
court
of
appeals
denied
rehearing
both
by
the
panel
and
en
banc.
at
that
point,
the
state,
particularly
after
this
court
denied
cert,
was
entitled
to
rely
on
the
finality
of
that
judgment.
the
state
did
not
need
the
mandate
in
order
to
proceed.
a
mandate
simply
directs
the
district
court
what
to
do
next.
it
was
not
necessary.
it
is
not...
it
is
completely
independent
and...
and
separate
from
the
disposition
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
the
stay
of
execution?
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
the
stay
of--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
stay
of
execution
dissolved
upon
the
disposition
of
the
appeal.
the
stay
was
pending
the
appeal.
the
appeal
in
our
view
was
disposed
of
upon
the
affirmance
of
the
denial
of
rehearing.
that
judgment
was
final
when
entered.
finality
was
suspended
only
during
the
timely
filed
petition
for
rehearing.
so
once
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
exercise
its
error-correcting
authority
to...
to
rehear
a
case...
rehear
the
case
either
en
banc
or
by
panel--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--your
honor,
we
have
cited
two
cases
on
page
13
of...
of
our
reply
brief.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
no.
there
was
no
formal
dissolution
of
the
stay.
in
our
view
it
dissolved
as
an...
by
operation
of
law.
thank
you,
your
honor.
