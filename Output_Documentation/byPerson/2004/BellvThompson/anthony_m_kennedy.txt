justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
are...
are
they
any--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
are
there
any
circumstances
in
which
the
court
can...
and
let's
again,
as
justice
souter
said,
say
that
it
put
it
on
the
record
what
it
was
going
to
do,
that
we
hereby,
after
the
supreme
court
has
ruled
in
the
case,
will
withhold...
order
that
the
mandate
shall
be
withheld
for
a
period
of
30
days
because
there
is
a...
a
new
case
coming
out
on
a
different
issue
that
may
affect
our...
our
holdings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
that
a
new
case
has
been...
has
been
released
and
we
think
that
bears
on...
on
the
outcome.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
want
to
consider
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
or
after
disposition
by
this
court
on
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
cert
is
granted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no...
so
no
circumstances
can
the
issuance
of
the
mandate
be
extended
after
this
court
has
denied
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
no
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
get...
if
i
may
just
get...
you
say
there
are
no
circumstances
in
which...
where
(d)
is
otherwise
applicable,
the
mandate
can...
can
be...
the
issuance
of
the
mandate
can
be
extended.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let...
let
me
ask
you
this.
your...
i
think
you
say
that
you...
you
cannot
extend
the
period
for
issuance
of
a
mandate
after
the
supreme
court
has
denied
the
petition.
could
the
court
then
issue
the
mandate
and
then
recall
it
under
calderon?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's...
let's
take
the
hypothetical
where
there
is
an
extraordinary...
where
it...
it
does
rise
to
the
very
high
level.
and
then
you
have
these
facts.
they
just
don't
say
anything
and...
and
they
keep
the
case.
if
they
could
have
issued
the
mandate
and
then
recalled
it,
what
difference
does
it
really
make,
assuming
there
is
an
extraordinary
circumstance?
i
know
you
deny
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was...
was
it
before
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--court
of
appeals
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
after
the
court
of
appeals
made
its
decision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
it
was
referenced
in
the
petition
for
rehearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
on...
you're
on
the
court
of
appeals.
they're
proceeding
for
execution.
the
families
of
the
victims
know.
the...
the
accused,
the
condemned
man,
is
being...
you
tell
your
colleagues,
let's
just
say
nothing
about
this.
you
think
that's
good
practice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
consistent
with
the
rule
not
to
enter
an
order
that
you're
extending
the
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
very
strange
reading
of
the
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
might
address
the...
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
that
extraordinary.
number
one,
the
court
of
appeals
did
have
reference
to
this
deposition
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
that
was
filed
with
it.
number
two,
the...
the
testimony
of...
of
the
psychiatrist
that
bears
on
the
issue
but
the...
there
was
a
hearing
on
that
point
and
another
psychiatrist
disagreed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
let's...
let's
assume
for
the
moment...
you
may
disagree.
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
calderon
standard
applies.
there
has
to
be
an
extraordinary
showing.
and
the
state
has
made
an
argument
here
that
this
isn't
that
extraordinary.
we
see
these
cases
all
the
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
this
court...
this...
in
this
case
the
state
court
thought
it
was
in
the
system.
it...
it
set
an
execution
date.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did...
did
the
stay
remain
in
effect
in
the
district
court,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
respondent
represents
that
the
stay
of
execution
was
entered
in
the
district
court
and
it
stayed
in
effect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
what
point
in
your
view
did
that
stay
become
dissolved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
1985,
gregory
thompson
was
convicted
by
a
jury
of
first
degree
murder
and
was
sentenced
to
death.
in
his
state
postconviction
petition,
thompson
claimed
his
trial
counsel
had
been
ineffective
for
failing
to
conduct
and
adequate
investigation
into
his
mental
health
for
use
as
mitigating
evidence
during
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial,
and
the
tennessee
courts
denied
thompson's
claims.
thompson
renewed
his
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
on
federal
habeas.
dr.
faye
sultan
is
a
psychologist
and
she
was
retained
by
thompson
for
the
federal
habeas
proceedings.
she
examined
thompson
and
concluded
that
he
was
likely
suffering
serious
mental
illness
at
the
time
of
the
murder
that
would
have
been
a
mitigating
circumstance
under
tennessee
law.
sultan
prepared
an
expert
report
on
thompson's
behalf
and
was
also
deposed
by
the
state.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
denied
habeas
relief.
they
held
thompson
had
not
presented
any
significant
probative
evidence
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
significant
mental
disease
that
should
have
been
presented
to
the
jury
during
the
punishment
phase.
sultan's
deposition
and
report
although
presented
to
the
district
court
as
part
of
an
untimely
rule
60(b)
motion,
had
not
been
properly
included
in
the
district
court
summary
judgment
record,
apparently
because
of
attorney
negligence.
the
court
of
appeals
denied
a
petition
for
rehearing
but
state
issuance
of
its
mandate
while
this
court
considered
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
a
petition
for
rehearing.
after
we
denied
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
issue
its
mandate.
the
state,
under
the
apparent
assumption
that
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings
have
terminated
scheduled
thompson's
execution.
on
june
23,
2004,
some
seven
months
after
this
court
denied
certiorari,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
issued
an
amended
opinion
in
thompson's
federal
habeas
case.
the
new
decision
vacated
the
district
court's
judgment
denying
habeas
relief
and
remanded
the
case
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
thompson's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
its
equitable
power
to
supplement
the
record
based
on
sultan's
report
and
deposition.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
justified
its
amended
opinion
based
on
the
court's
inherent
power
to
reconsider
its
own
earlier
opinion
prior
to
issuance
of
mandate.
the
state
sought
review
of
that
decision
and
we
granted
certiorari.
we
now
hold,
assuming
arguendo
that
the
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
41
does
authorize
a
stay
of
mandate
following
the
denial
of
certiorari
and
also
that
the
court
may
stay
a
mandate
without
entering
a
formal
order
that
here
the
court
of
appeals
abused
its
discretion
in
doing
so.
among
our
concerns
is
the
length
of
time
between
this
court's
denial
of
certiorari
and
the
court
of
appeals
issuance
of
its
amended
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
delayed
issuing
its
mandate
for
over
five
months
after
this
court
denied
rehearing.
the
consequence
of
delay
for
the
state's
criminal
justice
system
was
compounded
by
the
court
of
appeals
failure
to
issue
an
order
or
otherwise
give
notice
to
the
parties
that
the
court
was
reconsidering
its
earlier
opinion.
this
in
turn,
led
the
various
proceedings
in
state
and
federal
court
to
determine
thompson's
present
competency
to
be
executed.
all
of
the
steps
were
taken
in
reliance
on
the
mistaken
impression
that
thompson's
first
federal
habeas
case
was
final.
the
normal
mechanism
for
correcting
errors
in
the
courts
of
appeals
is
the
petition
for
rehearing.
indeed,
in
this
case,
thompson's
petition
for
rehearing
presented
the
same
arguments
based
on
the
sultan
evidence
that
eventually
were
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
amended
opinion.
our
review
of
the
sultan
deposition
reinforces
our
conclusion
that
the
court
of
appeals
abused
its
discretion
but
withholding
a
mandate.
had
the
sultan
deposition
report
been
fully
considered
in
the
federal
habeas
proceedings,
it
would
have
been
relevant
to
the
district
court's
analysis.
relevant
though
the
sultan
evidence
may
be
however,
it
is
not
of
such
a
character
as
to
warrant
the
court
of
appeals
extraordinary
departure
from
standard
appellate
procedures.
sultan
examined
thompson
13
years
after
his
crime
and
conviction.
she
relied
on
the
deterioration
in
thompson's
present
mental
health,
something
that
obviously
was
not
observable
at
the
time
of
the
trial
as
evidence
of
what
his
condition
might
have
been
in
1985.
indeed
there
was
a
marked
decline
in
thompson's
condition
during
the
six
month
period
between
sultan's
first
two
visits.
sultan's
findings
regarding
thompson's
condition
in
1985
are
contradicted
by
the
testimony
of
two
experts
who
did
examine
him
at
the
time
of
trial
and
found
that
he
suffered
from
no
mental
illness.
thompson's
trial
attorneys
chose
no
to
pursue
a
mitigation
strategy
based
on
mental
illness.
instead,
they
stressed
character
evidence
from
family
and
friends
and
expert
testimony
that
he
had
the
capacity
to
adjust
to
prison.
this
strategic
calculation
while
ultimately
unsuccessful
was
based
on
a
reasonable
investigation
into
thompson's
background.
one
last
consideration
informs
our
review
of
the
court
of
appeals
actions.
this
case
arises
from
federal
habeas
corpus
review
of
a
state
conviction.
we
have
previously
recognized
that
federalism
concerns
arising
from
the
unique
character
of
federal
habeas
review
of
state
court
judgments
require
an
additional
presumption
in
favor
of
finality.
in
this
case,
a
dedicated
united
states
circuit
judge
discovered
what
he
believed
to
have
been
an
error
in
the
previous
opinion
and
we
are
respectful
of
the
court
of
appeals
willingness
to
correct
a
decision
that
it
perceived
to
have
been
mistaken.
the
court's
discretion
under
rule
41
must
be
exercised,
however,
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
the
state's
interest
in
the
finality
of
convictions
that
have
survived
direct
review
within
the
state
court
system.
by
withholding
the
mandate
for
months
based
on
evidence
that
supports
only
an
arguable
constitutional
claim
while
the
state
prepared
to
carry
out
thompson's
sentence,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
accord
the
appropriate
level
of
the
respect
to
that
judgment.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
breyer
will
announce
his
dissenting
opinion
and
it
is
an
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
ginsburg
join.
