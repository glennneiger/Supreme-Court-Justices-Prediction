we'll
hear
argument
now
in
ricky
bell
v.
gregory
thompson.
ms.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
give
any
explanatory
reason
for
what
it
did?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
single
judge
doesn't
have
the
authority,
does
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
many
cases
very
similar
to
that...
this
exists?
it
struck
me
as
just
procedurally
bizarre.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
smith.
mr.
shors.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
how
long
after
the
judgment
becomes
final
can
a
court
engage
in
sua
sponte
consideration
of
whether
to
grant
a
rehearing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
shouldn't
the
state
at
least
be
notified
of
the
pendency
of
this
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
that...
that
really
doesn't
add
up.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
might
be
a
clerical
error
all
by
itself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
final
judgment
here
in
the
death
sentence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was...
this
was
how
long
after
cert
had
been
denied?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
say
there's
no
surprise
to
the
state,
that
may
be
the
state
probably
knew
as
much
as
the
defendant
about
what
was
in
the
record,
but
certainly
it
was
a
surprise
to
the
state
to
know
that
the
court
of
appeals,
after
cert
was
denied,
was
pondering
all
this
for
that
long
a
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
counsel
should
go
to
the...
see
the
docket
sheet
regularly
to
see
whether
the
court
of
appeals
might
be
doing
something?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
the
state
should
have
known
what
the
court
of
appeals...
before
cert
was
ever
considered
because
it
was
on
a
docket
sheet.
but
the
case
was
over,
so
far
as
the
parties
were
concerned,
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
district
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
talking
about
a
point
of
law
and
the
court
of
appeals
issued
an
opinion
saying
we
agree
with
three
circuits
and
disagree
with
four
others?
the
losing
party
brings
it
here
and
we
deny
certiorari.
it
goes
back.
and
then
one
of
the
judges
on
the
panel
says,
gee,
i
think
we
should
have
gone
with
the
other
circuits.
can
they
do
that
at
that
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
an
intervening
circumstance.
it's
not
a
single
judge
changing
his
mind.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the...
what
court
had
granted
the
stay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
remained
in
effect
all
that
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shors.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
smith.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
count
in
bell
against
thompson
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
