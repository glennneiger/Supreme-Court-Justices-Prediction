justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're...
if
you're
going
to...
if
you're
going
to
consider
something
that
wasn't
a
recall
of
a
mandate
as
if
it
was,
why
don't
you
consider
it
as
a
rule
41(b)
action?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
recall
it,
didn't...
did
they?
did
they
recall
it?
they
issued
it
and
then
recalled
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
so
we
did...
they
didn't
recall
it.
so,
of
course,
41(b)
does
not
have
to
do
with
recalls.
41(b)
has
to
do
with
issuances,
and
41(b)
says
the
court
may
shorten
or
extend
the
time
for
issuing.
now,
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
obvious
rule
to
apply
to
what
occurred
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
your
view--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
isn't
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--have
you
surveyed
the
circuits?
i
know
this...
what...
what
you
describe
as
the
practice
certainly
wouldn't
have
been
in
the
first
circuit.
maybe
in
the
d.c.
it
was,
but
i
mean,
we
would
have
thought
that
we
have
the
power
over
our
own
mandate.
and
of
course,
if
it
hasn't
issued
and
some
extraordinary
thing
comes
along
requiring
a
revision,
we
would
have
revised
it.
so
when
you
read
the
rules
and
you
say
that's
what
we
argue,
you're
not
arguing
it
about
any
court
that
i'm
familiar
with
as
an
appeals
court.
so...
so
have
you
looked
up
the
appeals
courts
and
found
that
in
fact
there
is
at
least
one
court
or
two
or
maybe
more
that
follow
the
interpretation
that
you're
arguing
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
have
not,
then
my
experience
would
be
you're
arguing
for
a
rule
that
no
appeals
court
follows,
that...
that
all
think
they
have
power
over
the
mandate,
and
that
the
question
becomes
one
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
good
reason
for
delaying
the
mandate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
there
was
a
good
reason,
they
could,
and
if
there
wasn't,
maybe
they
couldn't.
but
justice
ginsburg
has
set
forth
what
sounds
to
me
like
an
excellent
reason,
that
the
judge
discovered
he
had
made
an
error
that
could
mean
life
or
death
or
jail
or
innocence,
and
before
that
opinion
issues,
i
want
to
be
sure
it's
correct.
now...
now,
that's
how
i'm
thinking,
that
the
general
practice
is
contrary
to
what
you
say,
that
the
question
is
a
good
reason,
and
that
here
there
could
hardly
be
a
better
one.
so
what
is
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
all
the
circuits
have
just
been
wrong
in
their
interpretation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
why
i'm
quite
curious,
but
i
only
have
experience
in
one
circuit.
and...
and
i
have
an
impression,
but
i
need
to
know
what
is
the
general
practice.
i
would
have
thought...
but
this
is
highly
impressionistic...
that
probably
the
mandates
didn't
always
issue
within
7
days,
that
it
wasn't
totally
uncommon
to
have
them
10
days
or
12,
and
it
was
fairly
informal.
certainly
there
were
no
notice,
but
maybe
other
circuits
do
it
differently.
it's
an
area
that's
obscure
to
me,
and
i'd
like
to
know
how
do
people
actually
handle
it.
is
it
something
that
is
generally
within
the...
up
to
the
individual
court
of
appeals
to
provide
notice
or
not
or
whatever
as
it
wishes?
is
it
that
some
delays,
6
months,
might
be
really
much
too
late?
is
it...
how
does
it
work
in
the
circuits?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
don't
normally
give
notice
or...
or
something
like
that?
they
say,
it
will
be
here
in
7
days,
but
we'll
tell
you
we've
delayed
it.
they
just
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
we
might
have
handled
it
that
way,
but
i
don't
know
if
that's
the
right
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
justice
kennedy
said,
justice
stevens,
justice
souter,
justice
ginburg
and
i
dissent
in
this
case.
it
is
a
capital
case.
it
arises
out
of
unusual
circumstances
of
a
kind
that
i
have
not
seen
before
in
the
25
years
that
i
have
served
in
the
federal
bench.
it
may
sound
complicated
and
technical
but
it
is
not;
it
is
simple.
after
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
and
issued
its
decision,
and
after
the
rehearing
petition
was
denied,
but
before
the
court
issued
its
mandate,
the
panel's
writing
judge
happened
to
come
across
a
document
that
had
been
inexplicably
omitted
from
the
record.
it
was
a
psychiatric
report
based
upon
a
childhood
investigation
that
concluded
that
petitioner
suffered
from
bouts
of
schizophrenia
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
the
judge,
after
spending
hundreds
of
hours
reviewing
what
was
a
vast
record,
concluded
that
the
panel's
initial
opinion
was
clearly
wrong.
it
said
there
was
no
such
evidence
that
the
document
was
critically
important
and
that
to
ignore
that
document
would
lead
to
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
consequently,
the
panel
rewrote
its
decision
and
it
corrected
the
error.
the
court
now
holds
that
the
panel
abused
its
discretion
in
doing
that.
well,
how
could
that
be
so?
the
majority
does
not
claim
that
the
panel
was
trying
to
skirt
any
statutory
restrictions,
say
the
restrictions
that
limit
the
filling
of
second
habeas
petitions.
our
court
does
not
claim
that
the
panel's
action
reflected
anything
other
than
what
it
purported
to
be,
a
good
faith
effort
to
cure
an
inadvertent
error
in
a
death
case
to
avoid
potential
miscarriage
of
justice
and
those
tempted
to
believe
that
the
document
is
not
seriously
and
significantly
related
to
the
adequacy
of
trial
counsel's
performance,
or
for
some
other
reason
is
unimportant,
might
simply
read
it.
it
is
attached
to
the
dissent.
what,
i
repeat,
was
the
panel
supposed
to
do?
ignore
the
error?
we
in
dissent
believe
the
court
is
wrong
in
this
case
and
more
than
that,
a
legal
system
is
based
on
rules,
it
also
seeks
justice
in
the
individual
case.
sometimes,
those
ends
conflict.
to
take
account
of
that
possible
conflict,
the
system
often
grants
judges
a
degree
of
discretion
thereby
providing
oil
for
the
rule
based
gears.
by
reversing
the
panel
today,
the
court
tells
other
courts
not
to
act
where
they
believe
similar
action
is
necessary
to
avoid
serious
injustice
in
similar
cases.
the
consequence
is
to
divorce
the
rule
based
result
from
the
just
result.
our
judicial
systems
seeks
to
avoid
that
divorce.
today's
case
we
figure
is
an
unfortunately
step
in
the
wrong
direction.
