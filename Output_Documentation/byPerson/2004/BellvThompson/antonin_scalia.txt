justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
you
would
make
the
same
argument
to
that
that...
that
you
were
making
earlier,
i
assume,
that
to
read
it
that
way
would...
would
be
to
nullify
calderon.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
guess
i'm...
i'm
not
clear
about
the
facts
here.
did...
did
the
court...
did
the
court
comply
with
(b)?
did
it
shorten
or
extend
the
time?
was
there
any
issuance
of
a...
of
a...
of
an
order
shortening
or
extending
the
time,
or
did
the
court
just
ignore
the
deadline
and...
and
act
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there...
there
is
nothing
from
the
court
that...
that
says
we...
we
shorten
or
extend
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
i
guess
that
the...
that
the
conclusion
would
be,
if
you
read
41(b),
that
if
the
court
has
not
shortened
the
time,
the
court's
mandate
must
issue
7
calendar
days
after.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
couldn't
have
recalled
the
opinion
because
of
the
extraordinary
circumstance.
my
god,
i
made
a
mistake.
he
couldn't
recall
the
opinion,
could
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
know
that
all
the
circuits
have
that
interpretation.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
justice
breyer
conducted
the
kind
of
investigation
he
asked
you
about?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
wouldn't
have
to
suspend
the
rules
for
good
cause
since
it
has
authority
to
extend
the
time
for
issuing
the
mandate.
it
can
comply
with
41(b).
so
i
think
the
most
you
can
say
is
that
the
court,
when
it's
faced
with
extraordinary
circumstances
of...
of
the
sort
that
could
overcome
calderon,
should
issue
and
order
extending
the
mandate
because,
and
explaining
why,
because
there's
this
evidence
which,
if
true,
would,
you
know,
produce
a
miscarriage
of
justice
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
me
again.
how
do
you...
you
read
the
rule
to
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
calderon
requires
not
just
that
it
might
have
been
additional
mitigation,
but
that
the
defendant
would
have
been
ineligible
for
the
death
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
how
i
read
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
presume
your...
your
answer
would
also
be
that
if
it's
a
good
reason
for...
for
not
issuing
the
mandate,
as
you're
supposed
to,
it
would
equivalently
be
a
good
reason
to
recall
the
mandate.
we...
we
crossed
that
bridge
in
calderon.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
about...
about
the
provision
not
of
41(b)
but
of
41(d)(2)?
there
had
been
a
petition
for
certiorari
here,
which
was
denied.
justice
antonin
scalia
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
(d)(2)(d)
says
the
court
of
appeals
must
issue
the
mandate
immediately
when
a
copy
of
a
supreme
court
order
denying
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
is
filed.
that
didn't
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
it
has
to
issue
an
order?
the
state
here,
having
received
a
judgment
and...
and
seemingly
a
mandate
has
to
issue
after
the
judgment
unless
there's
an
order
extending
the
time...
went
ahead
with
proceedings
to...
to
set
the
execution,
to
have
the...
the
person
examined
to
be
sure
that
he
was
competent
to
be
executed,
going
through
many
stages,
and
was
it
proper
for
this
court
without...
without
ever
issuing
an
order
extending
the
time
for
the
mandate,
simply
to
come
back...
what...
18
months
later
and
say,
oh,
by
the
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
they...
they
just
do
it
even
when
they're
delaying
it
for
18
months
in
order
to
reconsider
the
case?
i
can
understand
they're
just
doing
it
when...
you
know,
for
clerical
or
other
reasons,
it...
it
comes
out
in
10
days
or
even
2
weeks
instead
of...
if
that's
what
you're
talking
about,
that
i
can
understand.
but
here
we're
talking
about
a
decision
for
a
lengthy
delay
in
order
that
the
court
may
reconsider
the
case.
i
would
be
astonished
if
it
were
regular
practice
for
a
court
to
do
something
like
that
without
notifying
the
parties.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i
don't
understand
is
how
your
argument
fits
in
with...
with
the
rule
that
you
can't
recall
the
mandate.
i
mean,
you
have
the
same
horrific
situation.
my
god,
we
made
a
mistake.
and
we've
held
you
can't
recall
the
mandate
unless
these
very
high
standards
are
met.
now,
are
we
going
to
hang
on
that
technical
distinction
between
not
issuing
the
mandate
forever
and
ever
and
recalling
the
mandate?
the
court...
a
court
has
inherent
power
to
recall
a
mandate,
but
we
said
you
will
not
do
it
unless
these
very
serious
obstacles
are...
are
eliminated.
and
it
seems
to
me,
just
as
a
court
does
have
power
to
extend
the
time
for
issuance
of
the
mandate,
it
makes
sense
to
say
the
same
thing.
you
shouldn't
do
it
unless
these
very
serious
obstacles
are
eliminated.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
they
did
grab
it
back
from
us.
i
mean,
if
what
you
say
is
true,
we
should
deny
cert
in
all
cases
where
the
mandate
hasn't
issued
or
where
the
only
stay
for
the
mandate
is
pending
disposition
of...
of
cert.
we
should...
we
should
put
that
in
our
rules.
they
did
snatch
it
back
from
us,
didn't
they?
what
if
we
had
granted
cert?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
we
had
granted
cert?
you...
you
say
they
then
could
not...
what...
what
would
happen
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
stayed.
it
just
wasn't
issued.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
is
recall
permitted.
i
mean,
courts
have
inherent
right
to
recall
too.
i
mean,
the
same--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
same
situation
existed
in...
in
calderon.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't...
but
why
wouldn't
that
be
read
in
light
of
aedpa
as
well?
i
mean,
whether
it's
a
common
law
rule
or
a
rule
that...
that's
written
down,
why
equally
shouldn't
they
be
read
in
light
of
aedpa?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
don't...
we
don't
have
to
be
that
harsh.
we
can...
i
don't
think
that's
the
question.
i
think
the
question
is
under
what
circumstances
can
you
correct
the
error
without
having
formally
acted
to
extend
the
time
for
issuance
of
the
mandate.
i
think
one
can
draw
a
distinction
between
the
court
just
sitting
there
and
doing
nothing
for
a
year
and
a
half
and...
and
then,
you
know,
during
which
it's
reconsidering
the
case
without
notice
to
anybody,
and
a
situation
in
which
a
court
takes
formal
action.
we're
extending
the
time.
we
could
have
a
much
lower
standard
for
the
latter
than...
than
for
the
former.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is...
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
and...
and
it
is
certainly
reasonable
to
apply
one
standard
for
abuse
of
discretion
where
the
court
has
entered
an
order
notifying
all
parties
that
it's
reconsidering
the
case
and
a
different
standard
when
it
hasn't
done
that.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
spelled
out
in
the
rule.
