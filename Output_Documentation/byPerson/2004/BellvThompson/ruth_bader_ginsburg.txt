justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
you
accepted
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
this
court
would
also
count,
although
the
rule
doesn't
say
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
rule
speaks
about
the
mandate
should
issue
when
cert
is
denied,
but
in
this
case,
there
was
a
further
extension
while
this
court
was
considering
a
petition
for
rehearing.
do
you
say
that
that
was
also
outside
the
rules
so
that
the
mandate
would
have
to
issue
when
cert
is
denied
even
if
there
is
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
a
request
to
continue
the
stay
during
the
pendency
of
that
rehearing
petition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
say
that
that
was
wrong
in
this
case
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
prosecutor...
did
the
prosecutor
object
when
there
was
a
further
extension
given
for
the
pendency
of
the
petition
for
rehearing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
smith,
this...
unlike
the
calderon,
which
is
a...
was
a...
a
court
has
authority
to
recall
a
mandate
that
has
already
issued,
this
seemed
to
be
a
really
idiosyncratic
case.
i
mean,
this
was
an
extraordinary
situation
where
a
judge
said,
my
goodness,
i
wrote
an
opinion
that
assumed
this
person
was
mentally
okay,
and
now
i
discovered
in
the
file
things
i
never
saw
before.
this
is
a
death
case.
i
have
reason
to
suspect
that
this
person
may
not
have
been
competent
when
he
committed
the
crime,
may
not
have
been
competent
when
he...
when
he
stood
trial,
may
not
be
competent
at
this
very
moment.
a
judge
in
that
situation...
he
finds
something
that
looks
like
it's
the...
it's...
it's
the
key
piece
of
evidence
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
somehow
it
never
got
submitted.
a
judge,
knowing
that
he
has
written
an
opinion
saying
this
man,
as
far
as
the
federal
courts
are
concerned,
goes
to
the
state
and
they
can
set
their
date
of
execution
and
all
that...
that
was
an...
this
case
is
so
idiosyncratic
that
i'm
concerned
about
dealing
with
41(b)
and
mandates
for
this
really
unusual
situation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
two
different
points
in
time,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
it
have
been
presented?
because
it
wasn't...
it
wasn't
even
in
the
record
in
the
district
court.
i
mean,
that
was
what
suhrheinrich
was
so
bewildered
about,
that
here
was
what
seemed
to
be
the
strongest
evidence
of
the
defendant,
and
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding
in
the
district
court,
it's
not
even
made
formally
a
part
of
the
record.
it
was
a
deposition.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
wasn't...
it
wasn't
in
the
district
court
record.
it
wasn't
in
the
record
that
went
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
wasn't
in
the
record
on
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
you're
saying
is...
essentially
is
we
should
regard
this
as
though
what
wasn't
done
had
been
done
because
it
was
supposed
to
have
been
done.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
treat
this
just
as
if
the
mandate
issued
and
was
being
recalled.
that's
what
i
get
to
be
the
gist
of
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
any
precedent,
any
case,
in
which
rule
41(b)
has
been
invoked
after
there
has
been
a
petition
for
cert
and
petition
for
cert
has
been
denied?
in
practice,
is
there
any
other
case
in
the
world
like
this?
i
don't
know
of
any.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that...
is
that
really
true?
is...
you
have
a
judgment,
and
it
doesn't
have
preclusive
effect
from
the
time
it
issues?
it...
it's
just
sort
of
suspended
there
with
no
effect
until
the
mandate
issues?
