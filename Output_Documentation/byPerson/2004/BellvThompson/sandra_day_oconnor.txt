well,
it
doesn't
expressly
say
that
in
that
last
sentence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
going
to
address
the
seriousness
with
which
this
evidence
should
be
viewed?
because
it
is
disturbing.
it
certainly
would
go
to
whether
a
death
penalty
should
be
given.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you...
you
think
it
could
not
have
been
considered
in
mitigation
in
the
decision
whether
to
give
a
death
sentence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
so
remarkable,
isn't
it,
that
the
court
did
not
notify
the
state
and...
and
the
defendant
about
what
it
was
considering?
it
didn't
enable
them
to
address
the
issues
by
briefs,
memos,
or
argument.
i
mean,
this...
this...
it's
just
an
amazing
sequence,
don't
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how...
how
could
they
possibly
do
the
best
job
they
could
on
the
opinion
without
letting
the
parties
know
what
they
were
trying
to
do
and
to
address
the
issue?
