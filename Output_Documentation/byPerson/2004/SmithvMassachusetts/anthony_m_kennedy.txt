justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
you
have
a
state
and
the
state
has
a
statute,
and
the
statute
says
any
motion
for
acquittal
may
be
granted
by
the...
the
trial
court
at
the
close
of
the
prosecution's
evidence,
but
that
motion
shall
not
be
deemed
final
and
may
be
reviewed
by
the
district
court
at
any
time
before...
or
by
the
trial
court
at
any
time
before
the
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury.
then
there's
no
repose
element
because
the...
the
defendant
is
on
notice
that
this
may
not
be
final.
what
would
be
the...
your
position
in
that
case
if
a
statute
like
that
were
on
the
books?
and
if
you
say
that
that's
different,
then
i'll
say,
well,
suppose
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
just
makes
up
this
rule
as
a
judicial
matter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay,
well,
let...
let's
just
assume
that
you've
conceded
that.
now,
you've
been
guarded
about
it.
if
we
can
do
that
by
statute,
why
can't
we
do
that
by
a
judicial
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of...
judicial
court
of
massachusetts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
they
put
a
gloss
on
the
rule
by
their
decision.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if...
if...
you
know,
we
shape
the
expectation
by
what
we
say.
if...
if
we
say
that
a
judge
is
always
free
to
consider
his
rule
and
as
long
as
the...
there's
a
right
to
reopen,
then
any
kind
of
reliance
is...
is
misplaced.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
defendant
here
ask
to
be...
to
have
the
right
to
reopen?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
minute--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
minute
he--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is...
is
another...
is
another
difference...
and
i
don't
know
if
this...
is
another
difference
that
in
the
hypothetical
case
with
the
jury,
the
jury
has
not
yet
deliberated--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
order
to
consider
the
facts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whereas
in
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--your
case,
the...
the
judge
is...
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--apparently
deliberating--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
under...
under
that
view
of
things,
suppose
in
this...
in
this
case
there's
a
motion
for
acquittal
and
the
judge
says,
yes,
i...
i
think
there's
no
evidence
on
the
gun.
then
the
prosecutor
says
i
want
10
minutes
because
i
think
there's
a
case
on
it.
then
he
says,
you
know,
there's
a
case
and
i
think
it
covers
this,
and
the
judge
says,
well,
i
think
you
may
be
wrong.
i'll
let
you
reopen
to
put
on
evidence
of...
of
the
gun.
what
would...
what
would
be
the
result
in
that
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you
have
to
say
that
under
your
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would...
would
you
allow
a
trial
judge
to
reopen...
to...
to
permit
the
prosecution
to
reopen
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
had
three...
three
reasons
you
were
going
to
give
justice
souter.
one
is
it's
not
clear
always
that
it's
definitive.
the
other
is
that
trial
judges
do
make
mistakes,
and
the
third
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
line
would
be
something
like
if
it...
if...
from
all
of
the
transcript,
it
appears
that
the
judge
is...
is
giving
consideration
to
the
entire
case
or
something
like
that
in
a
bench
trial.
