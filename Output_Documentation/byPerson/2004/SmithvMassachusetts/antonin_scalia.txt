once
it's
final
under
state
procedure,
right?
and
you
also
would
add
once
there's
no
clerical
error.
she
didn't
mistakenly
say,
you
know,
affirm
when
she
meant
to
write
deny.
leaving
that
aside,
once
it's
final
under
state
procedure,
it's
final.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
sometimes
it's
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it'd
be
sometimes
wrong
no
matter
how
you
define
final.
i
mean,
you
know,
if
she
let's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let's
all
the
evidence
on
and...
and
does
it
after
all
the
evidence
is
there,
and
then
she...
and
then
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence,
she
gives
a
directed
verdict
for...
for
the
defendant,
and
then
discharges
the
jury,
and
as
soon
as
the
jury
walks
out,
oh,
my
god,
what
a
mistake
i
made.
too
bad.
right?
i
mean,
we
say
double
jeopardy.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
state
have
the
power
to
say
whether...
whether
an
acquittal
under
state
law
constitutes
an
acquittal
for
purposes
of
federal
constitutional
double
jeopardy
purposes?
is
that
a
state
law
question
or
a
federal
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if...
what
if
this
had
been
the
sole
count,
the
gun
possession
count
had
been
the
sole
count,
and...
and
the
same
ruling
had
been
made
by
the
judge?
would
you
say
that
there
was
double
jeopardy
attaching
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
if
it's
a
bench
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it's
difficult.
what's
your
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
over.
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
it
goes
all
the
way
up
on
appeal
and
the
jury...
i...
i
don't
know
what
the...
i
guess
he
lets
the
jury
go
home
for
a
couple
of
months
or
while
the
appeal
is
pending
and
then
when
the
decision
is
overturned
by
the
court
of
appeals,
he
comes
back
and
recommences
the
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
conceptual
basis
for
saying
that
jury
discharge
makes
the
difference?
why
is
that
the
touchstone?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
we
usually
don't
use--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
don't
use
the...
i
mean,
you
could
use
the
due
process
clause
for
everything,
for
double
jeopardy,
for
all
of
the
other
protections
in
the
constitution.
i
think
our
cases
say
if...
if
there's
a
problem
that
has
been
created
by
ignoring
the
double
jeopardy
rules,
you
don't
solve
that
problem
by...
by
the
deus
ex
machina
of
the
due
process
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
a
problem
created
by
the
judge's
dismissal,
which
this
defendant
had
every
reason
to
rely
upon
as
being
the
end
of
that
part
of
the
case.
i'm
inclined
to
say
if...
if
that
is
a
problem,
in
fairness
it's
a...
it's
a
double
jeopardy
problem,
not
a
due
process
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
fact,
the...
the
quick
and
dirty
procedure
you
describe
is
probably
a
boon
to
prosecutors
because
a
judge
is...
is
not
likely
to
take
the
serious
step
of
dismissing
a
charge
on
the
basis
of...
of
such
a
procedure
and
is
more
likely
to
say,
well,
we'll
let
the
trial
go
ahead
and
see
what
the
evidence
discloses.
i
mean,
i
can't
imagine
that
this
is
not
a
boon
to
the
prosecutor
rather
than,
as
you...
as
you
seem
to
paint
it
here,
a
disadvantage.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
very
unusual
judge
i
would
think
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
whip
it
out
like
that
and...
and
enter
an
acquittal
without...
without
letting
it
go
forward.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
may...
you
may
regret
what
you've
asked
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
shouldn't
you
have...
what's
magic
about
the
jury?
why
shouldn't
you
have
the
same
rule
on
a
bench
trial?
a
judge
in
a
bench
trial
makes
a
ruling,
thinks
about
it,
and
says,
you
know,
i
shouldn't
have
ruled
that
way.
why
shouldn't
that
judge
be
able
to
change?
just
because
there's
no
jury
to
discharge.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
is
the
line?
i
mean,
is
there...
there
no
point
at
which
he
can't
change?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
it's
not
dismissal
of
the
jury.
we'll
have
to
make
up
some
other
line.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
honing?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
no.
03-8661
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
appeals
of
court
of
massachusetts.
the
petitioner
was
tried
in
massachusetts
superior
court
on
several
criminal
charges,
one
of
which
was
unlawful
possession
of
a
firearm.
under
the
state
statute,
to
prove
that
possession
offense
the
prosecution
had
to
establish
that
petitioner
possessed
a
weapon
with
a
barrel
less
than
16
inches
long.
the
only
evidence
from
that
point
was
the
shooting
victims
testimony
that
petitioner
had
shot
him
with
a
pistol
or
a
revolver.
when
the
prosecution
concluded
its
evidence
petitioner
move
for
a
required
finding
of
not
guilty,
which
under
massachusetts
procedure
is
an
acquittal
by
the
judge.
out
of
the
jury’s
presence,
the
judge
granted
the
motion
as
to
the
firearm
count
because
she
thought
the
prosecution
had
presented
“not
a
scintilla
of
evidence”
that
the
firearm
had
a
barrel
shorter
than
16
inches.
the
prosecution
rested
and
the
defense
case
proceeded
on
the
remaining
counts
of
the
indictment.
after
petitioner
and
his
codefendant
arrested,
the
prosecution
persuaded
the
judge
that
her
earlier
ruling
had
been
wrong
because
a
massachusetts
precedent
established
unsurprisingly
that
the
statement
that
a
gun
was
a
pistol
was
sufficient
to
show
that
it
had
a
barrel
less
than
16
inches.
the
judge
announced
that
she
was
reversing
her
previous
ruling
and
letting
the
firearm
count
go
to
the
jury.
petitioner
was
convicted
on
all
counts.
the
appeals
court
of
massachusetts
affirmed
that
conviction
rejecting
petitioner’s
argument
that
he
had
been
subjected
to
double
jeopardy
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
appeals
court
held
that
nothing
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
a
trial
judge
from
reconsidering
her
own
ruling.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
we
the
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
appeals
court
and
hold
that
petitioner
was
subjected
to
double
jeopardy.
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
an
acquittal
by
a
judge
precludes
reexamination
of
the
defendant’s
guilt
no
less
than
an
acquittal
by
a
jury.
the
judge's
ruling
in
this
case
met
the
definition
of
an
acquittal.
it
held
that
the
prosecution
had
failed
to
prove
a
factual
element
of
the
offense
charge.
because
petitioner
was
acquitted,
the
subsequent
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury
amounted
to
an
impermissible
second
jeopardy
unless
the
constitution
permits
the
judge
to
reconsider
her
own
mid
trial
ruling
of
acquittal.
in
this
case,
petitioner
had
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
state
court’s
ruling
was
a
final
one.
it
was
not
labeled
as
tentative.
indeed,
state
procedure
required
the
judge
to
make
a
ruling
on
petitioner’s
motion
before
the
defendants
began
their
case,
nor
was
there
any
state
procedural
rule
on
the
book
that
allowed
the
judge
to
reconsider
her
ruling
if
she
became
convince
that
her
legal
conclusion
had
been
wrong.
the
state
rules
provided
only
for
the
correction
of
clerical
errors
or
errors
“arising
from
oversight
or
omission.”
massachusetts
identifies
a
few
state
court
cases
that
permit
reconsideration
of
interlocutory
rulings
such
as
rulings
on
pretrial
motions.
but
these
precedence
does
not
clearly
extent
to
a
judge’s
findings
of
not
guilty
which
is
not
interlocutory
because
it
purports
to
terminate
that
count
of
the
indictment.
we
think
that
the
state
can
by
stature
rule
or
common
law
provide
that
mid
trial
judgment
of
acquittal
are
subject
to
reconsideration,
but
if
an
acquittal
by
all
appearances
is
final
it
may
induce
a
defendant
to
make
strategic
choices
that
would
be
prejudicial
if
the
acquittal
may
reconsidered
later
in
the
trial.
for
example,
establishing
the
defense
to
the
remaining
counts
may
make
it
useful
for
him
to
admit
his
guilt
on
the
acquitted
count.
the
double
jeopardy
clause's
guarantee
cannot
be
allowed
to
become
a
potential
snare
for
those
who
reasonably
rely
upon
it.
massachusetts
has
not
shown
that
the
judges
finding
of
not
guilty
was
automatically
or
even
presumptively
non-final.
at
most
it
has
shown
that
the
finding
was
legally
incorrect
but
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
reexamination
of
acquittals
even
when
they
are
plainly
wrong.
for
these
reasons
and
others
expressed
in
our
opinion
today,
we
hold
that
petitioner’s
rights
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
were
violated.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
appeals
court
of
massachusetts
and
we
remand
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
kennedy
and
breyer
have
joined.
