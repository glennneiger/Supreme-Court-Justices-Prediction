ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
with
where
the
court
left
off
on
the
notion
of
reconsideration
and
finality.
the
massachusetts
appeals
court
here
specifically
stated
that
a
judge's
right
to
reconsider
his
or
her
legal
rulings
is
firmly
rooted
in
the
common
law
and
permitted
judge
donovan
in
this
case
to
reconsider
her
legal
ruling
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
certainly
that
common
law
right
of
reconsideration
could
not
run
afoul
of
this
court's
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence,
but
the
appeals
court
specifically
stated
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
not
violated
because
there
was
no
second
proceeding
and
that
the
judge
in
this
case,
therefore,
was
permitted
to
reconsider
her
ruling.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
not
so
long
as
the
jury
was
still
there.
if
the
prosecutor
had
the
opportunity
to
say,
judge
donovan,
give
me
10
minutes,
i
know
there's
a
supreme
judicial
court
case
on
the
point
that
i'm
arguing
to
you,
which
is
that
you
did
not
need
a
witness
to
directly
testify
that
the
gun
barrel
length
was
less
than
16
inches,
i
know
there's
a
case,
give
me
10
minutes,
take
a
recess,
and
if
the
judge
agreed
to
do
that
and
the
prosecutor
came
back
and
gave
the
case
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
said,
absolutely,
you're...
you're
correct,
i'm
going
to
send
the
charge
to
the
jury,
there's
no
double
jeopardy
violation
there.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
a
bench
trial
is
a
very
difficult
situation.
and
the
smalis
case
certainly
seems
to
be
the
hardest
case
here,
but
bench
trials
present
different...
a
different
situation
because
the
judge
is
both
the
fact-finder
and
the
law-giver.
and
in
that
context,
it's
much
more
difficult--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--my
answer
to
that
is
i
believe
that
if
the
judge
stated
the
evidence
is
insufficient,
as...
as
the
judge
did
in
smalis,
as
the
trier
of
fact
and
law,
i
find
the
evidence--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--it's
over.
it's
over.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
in
a
jury
case,
your
honor?
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
i
think--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--if
such
a...
if
such
a
process
could
be
put
in
place
where
there
was
an
appellate
panel
that
would
be
willing
and
available
to
hear
that
while
the
jury
remained
empaneled,
i
don't
think
it
would
run
afoul
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
that
is--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--the
smalis
case?
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
ways
to
reconcile
it.
certainly
massachusetts'
position
is
that
it's
the
difference
between
a
bench
trial
and
a
jury
trial,
but
there
is
also
no
doubt
that
the
case
left
the
trial
court
and
went
up
on
appeal.
i
think
both
of
those
factors
are
significant.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
i
don't
think
it
would.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
i
think...
i
think
for
a...
i
think
for
my...
to
my
way
of
thinking
about
the
cases,
the
jury
is
what
matters
and
it's
the
defendant's
right
to
his
particular
tribunal,
and
that's
the
first
jury
that's
empaneled--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--exactly.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
exactly.
so
i
would
say
that
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
that's
why
i
think--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--because
he...
he
is
the
trier
of
fact,
and
i
think
at
that
point--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--that's--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--well,
i
think
the
difference
is
the...
the
judge
in
smalis
was
the
trier
of
fact.
he
made
a
rule...
he
is
both
the
trier
of
fact
and
the
law-giver.
he's
decided
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
if
that
case
goes
up
on
appeal,
that
is...
that
is
factual...
that
is
oversight
of
his
factual
determination
in
essence.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
thank
you.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
yes.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
that's
where
i
was
headed.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
well,
he
certainly
had
some
sense
of
reliance,
but
it
wasn't
a
double
jeopardy
reliance.
and
i
would...
i
would
point
the
court
to--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--absolutely,
justice
stevens.
and
i
think--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--yes.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
i...
justice
breyer,
i...
i
certainly
believe
that
the...
that
the
double
jeopardy
rule
that
we're...
we're
advocating
would
permit
that,
but
i...
i
think
that
most
trial
judges
would
not
be
very
pleased
about
doing
something
like
that.
and
practically
speaking,
there's--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--i...
i
have
to
stick
with
the
rule
that...
that--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--i
think
it...
i...
well,
it's...
it's...
i
think
if...
i
think
if
you
accept
the
notion
that
jury
discharge
is
what
matters
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
permitting
a
trial
judge
to
reconsider
a
legal
ruling
up
to
that
point,
then
if
a
state
court
could
fashion
an
interlocutory
review
process
of
that
legal
ruling,
that
would
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
i
think
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
it
is
the
jury...
the
defendant's
right
to
hold
onto
his
chosen
jury
that
matters
in
a
number
of
different
contexts
in
the
double
jeopardy
area.
this
court
has
drawn
the
line
at
attachment
of
jeopardy
when
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn
based
on
the
historical
value
of
a
defendant
having
that
particular
jury
resolve
the
government's
case
against
him.
and
so
i
think
that
it
matters,
particularly
where
a
motion
for
a
required
finding
is
not
constitutionally
mandated.
it's
a
tool
that--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--that
is
a
very
serious
matter,
and
it
is
the
sort
of
prejudice
that
falls
within
the
rubric
of
due
process
and...
and--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--would
grant
you
a
retrial.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
no.
that's...
that's
exactly
correct.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
well,
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
would
say
it
is
the
sort
of
reliance
that
a...
that
a
defendant
may
have,
as
for
example
the
case
in
sanabria,
where
a...
where
a
judge
excludes
certain
evidence,
and
the
case
goes
forward.
and
as
a
result
of
that...
a
result
of
that
decision,
the
judge
in
that
case
granted
a
motion
for
acquittal.
and
at
the
end
of
the
case,
the
prosecution
asked
for
reconsideration
of
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence,
and
the
judge
ultimately
determined
not
to
go
ahead
and
let
that
evidence
back
in,
but
specifically
said
if
i
had
let
it
back
in,
i
would
have
vacated
my
motion
for
required
finding
and
allowed
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury.
so
that
sort
of
prejudice...
a
defendant
has
an
expectation
of
certain
things
that
may
or
may
not
happen
at
trial,
but
the
remedy
outside
of
the
double
jeopardy
context,
if
the
defendant
is
acquitted,
is
a
retrial.
the
drastic
remedy
of
double
jeopardy
is...
is
used
when
a
defendant
has
been
subjected
twice
to
a
trial
before
a
second
trier
of
fact.
this...
this
court
has
been
consistent
that
when
the
government
subjects
the
defendant
over
and
over
again
before
a
second--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--no,
no,
no.
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
no.
only
if
the
defendant
is
convicted
is
the
remedy
a
retrial
because,
indeed,
if
the
jury
acquits
him,
there
is
no
harm
at
all.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
i
could
live
with
that
rule.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
no,
no.
our
position
has
been
consistent.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
i
think
that
because
if
it's
a
jury
trial
and
the
case
is
still...
and
the
jury
is
still
there,
it
could
be
done
without
violating
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
i
think
so.
i
think
honing...
what
this
court
has
talked
about
in
honing
is...
is
refining
a
case
before
a
second
trier
of
fact.
and
as
a
matter
of
massachusetts'
procedures,
certainly
the
prosecution
may
be
able
to
reopen
if
there's
good
faith
or
mistake,
but
for
purposes
of--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
if
i
misunderstood
the
hypothetical,
that...
that
was
my
mistake.
as
a
matter
of
massachusetts
law,
a
trial
judge
does
not
have
that
option.
she
must
rule
on
the
motion
before
the
defendant
decides
to
put
on
the
case,
and
that
is
what
happened
here.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
that
is
correct.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
that
is
correct.
she
could
not.
and...
and
if
i
could
just
highlight
a
couple
of
points
to...
to
demonstrate
the
significance
of...
of
permitting
trial
judges
the
ability
to
reconsider
legal
rulings.
in
massachusetts,
the
fact
that
there's
a
written
motion
here
is
quite
unusual.
these
motions
are
made
orally
generally.
the
prosecution
is
not
given
an
opportunity...
does
not...
there's
no
requirement
that
he
be
given
advance
notice
ever.
there's
no
requirement
of
that.
the
prosecution
argues
in
opposition
to
the
motion
on
the
spot,
and
the
judge
rules
on
the
spot.
and...
and
i
think
that...
that
procedure
is
demonstrated
quite
clearly
here.
the...
the
defendant
filed
the
motion.
the
prosecution
did,
indeed,
argue
the
correct
response,
legal
response,
did
not
have
a
case
at
hand
and
as--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--that's
true.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
i...
i
wouldn't
want
to
characterize--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--yes.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
i
would
say
it
is
unusual,
but
it
happens
where...
and
i
think
the
trial
judge
certainly
in
this
case
who
believes
that
if
she's
mistaken,
can...
can
correct
her
ruling
and
send
it
to
the
jury,
then
feels
somewhat
free
to...
to
do
what
the
defendant
asks,
if
it
seems
reasonable,
and...
and
knows
that
if...
if
it
can
be
corrected--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--i
hope
not,
justice
scalia.
i
hope
not.
i
think--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
it
presents
a
double
jeopardy
bar,
but
a
defendant
has
a
right
to
be
present
at
his
trial,
and
so
it
certainly
would
be
a
reversible
error
if...
if
a
trial
judge--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--then
there's
certainly
no
double
jeopardy
bar
to
that.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
absolutely,
justice
breyer,
and...
and--
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
--well,
certainly.
rule
25
itself
specifically
states
that
the
defendant
shall
have
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence
after
the
motion
is
denied
or
allowed
in
part
without
reserving
that
right.
so
certainly
that
option
is
available.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions.
ms.
cathryn
a.
neaves
thank
you.
