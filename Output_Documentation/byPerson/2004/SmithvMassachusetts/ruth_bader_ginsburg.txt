justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
just
to
say
that
this...
what
happened
here
was
not
a
final
determination.
take
an
analog...
an
analogy
to
rule
54(b).
the
judge
can
say,
yes,
i've
made
this
ruling
and
it
sticks.
you
see,
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
separate
piece
of
paper
that
says
judgment,
but
if
i
don't
give
you
that
separate
piece
of
paper,
even
though
i
said
judgment
granted,
it
doesn't
count
until
the
very
end
of
the
case.
i
can
always
change
my
mind.
why
shouldn't
it
operate
the
same
way
on
the
criminal
side?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i
looked
at
martin
linen,
and
there,
there
was
something
labeled
judgment
of
acquittal
entered.
here
we
have
an
endorsement
on
a
motion,
and
then
we
have
an
entry
by
the
clerk
saying...
what
does
the
entry
say?
motion
granted
or
something
like
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but
is
there...
this
might
be
significant.
is
there
in
massachusetts,
when
a
motion
for
acquittal
is
granted
and
there
are
other
charges
still
going
on,
is
there
a
piece
of
paper
that
says,
judgment,
acquitted
on
count
whatever
it
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
a
very
plain
error--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that
was
a
terribly
risky
defense
because
his
main
defense
is
i
wasn't
there,
i
didn't
do
it,
somebody
else
did
it.
how
could
he
then
turn
around
and
say
i
missed
the
opportunity
to
tell
the
jury
i
really
was
there,
but
it
was
okay
for
me
to
have
the
gun?
i
mean,
what...
what
defense
counsel
would
do
that
after
having
spent
his
whole
effort
to
say
it
was
the
other
guy,
it
wasn't
this
defendant?
and
then
to
make
this
defense
that
he
had
a
right
to
possess
this
gun
because
he
belonged
in
the
house,
that
would
be
extraordinary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nobody
charged
her
with
possessing
a
gun.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's...
look,
there
were
a
lot
of
charges
in
this
case,
and
we're
dealing
with
what
is
a
relatively
lesser
offense
of
this
whole
string
of
events
so
that
brown
being
acquitted
of
other
offenses
doesn't
say
anything
about
this
offense,
which
relates
to
the
possession
of
a
gun.
that's...
that's
all
that
it
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
would
be...
the
defendant...
you
know,
he
hasn't
gone
to
the
jury
yet,
and
the
jury
would
say,
my
goodness,
this
is
like
a
common
law
pleader.
i
didn't
borrow
the
kettle.
it
was
broken
when
i
got
it.
i
returned
it
unbroken.
to...
to
do
that,
to
say
i
wasn't
there,
that's
my
main
defense,
but
then,
jury,
i'd
like
you
also
to
consider
that
if
you
think
that
i
was
there,
then...
it...
it
really
doesn't
fly
as
a
criminal
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
is
when
the
case
is
not
ongoing.
i
mean,
here
we
had
a
case
that
was
continuing
and...
and
the
judge
said,
oops,
i
made
a
mistake,
which
is
common
at
the
trial
level.
i
mean,
these
decisions...
she
made
this
decision
in
a
split
second.
maybe
she
was
too
hasty,
and
then
a
trial
judge
will
say,
my
law
clerk
went
to
the
library
at
lunch,
there
was
a
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
case
going
just
the
other
way,
so
of
course,
i
confess
error,
but
the
defendant
isn't
prejudice.
the
defendant
hadn't
put
on
a...
well,
the...
it
came
up
at
closing.
right?
so
if
the
defendant
was
prejudice,
anyway
he
could
have
said,
wait
a
minute,
judge,
i
want
to
put
on
that
defense
that
i
really
was
there
but
i
had
a
right
to
have
the
gun.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
could
have.
so
he...
so
i
don't
see
that
you
have
a
realistic
claim
of
prejudice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
have
to
set
a...
a
point
in
time,
and
your
point
is...
well,
it's
not
exactly
clear,
but
there's
one
point
that
says
when
the
jury
is
discharged.
then
there
may
be
other
reasons
why
there's
unfairness
to
the
defendant
so
that
you
wouldn't
permit
it,
other
than
double
jeopardy.
but
if...
why
isn't
that
a
sensible
place
to
draw
the
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question...
we're
talking
about
a
federal
constitutional
rule,
and
suppose...
you
pointed
out
this
went
only
to
an
intermediate
appellate
court.
suppose
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
interpreted
its
rule
at
25(a)
and
it
says,
that
rule
allows
some
leeway
for
the
judge
to
say
i
got
it
wrong
as
long
as
there's
no
prejudice
to
the
defense.
that's
what
our
rule
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
very
true--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
why
did
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
say...
and
i
thought
it
did
say
this
in
its
rules...
trial
judge,
you
rule
on
the
spot
when
a
motion
to
acquit
is
made?
we
will
not
allow
you
to
reserve
judgment.
because
the
normal
thing
would
be
a
trial
judge
would
say,
why
should
i
decide
this
definitively
now?
i'll
wait
till
the
end
of
the
case.
but
as
i
understand
the
massachusetts
rules,
it
says,
judge,
you
can't
reserve
on
a
motion
to
acquit.
you
must
rule
immediately.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so...
so
part
of
justice
breyer's
question
needs
editing
because
it
would
not
be
possible
under
massachusetts
law
for
the
judge
to
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
reserve.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
happen...
i
think
one
of
the
briefs
suggested
that
suppose
you
have
a
multi-defendant
case
and
the
judge
says,
after
the
prosecution
case
is
done,
defendant
a,
i'm
going
to
grant
a
motion
to
acquit.
he's
out
of
it,
but
there
was
enough
evidence
to
require
the...
the
defense
to
go
on
for
b
and
c.
and
then
after
hearing
b
and
c's
defense,
the
judge
said,
i
think
i
was
wrong
about
acquitting
a,
so
i'm...
i'm
going
to
withdraw
it.
would
there
be...
could
that
be
done
without
any...
any
double
jeopardy
bar?
the
jury
hasn't
been
discharged.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
the...
the...
he's
sitting
there.
defendant
a
is
sitting
there
throughout
the
whole
trial.
