justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
do
agree,
i
take
it,
that
if
the
judge
says,
yes,
i
agree
with
you,
there
isn't
a
scintilla
of
evidence,
and...
and
at
some
point
i'm...
i'm
going
to
enter
an
acquittal,
but
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
now
just
in
case
i
have
a
second
thought,
but
at
least
by
the...
the
end
of
the
trial,
i'll
take
care
of
it,
you,
i
take
it,
concede
that
that
is
permissible.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that...
if
that's
permissible,
if
you
win
this
case,
isn't
that
going
to
be
the
way
trials
are
conducted
when...
when
there
are
mid-trial
motions
like
yours?
every
judge
is
going
to
say,
yes,
looks
as
though
you...
you
got
them
there,
but
i'll...
i'll
just
hold
onto
this
until
things
are
over,
and
then
i'll
rule.
that's...
that's
the
way
they're
all
going
to
respond,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
every
judge
knows
he
drops
a
catch
once
in
a
while,
and...
and
if
he
wants
to
guard
against
wrecking
the
whole
trial
or...
or
creating
an
appellate
issue
later,
he's
just
going
to
be
cautious
and
hold
onto
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
does...
does--
justice
david
h.
souter
--did
he--
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
isn't...
isn't
the
significance
supposedly
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
our
continuation
of
the
jury
panel,
going
back
to
justice
stevens'
question?
and
what
if
the...
what
if
the
state
had
a
procedure
whereby
the
trial
judge
would
simply
decline
to
discharge
the
jury
panel
if
an
appeal
were
taken
from
the
acquittal
motion
so
that
if
he
was
tipped
over,
it
could
come
right
back
to
the
same
jury
panel?
would...
would
the...
would
the
answer
have
to
be
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
on
my
hypothesis
he's
going
to
get
the
same
jury.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
have
not
been
discharged.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
if
that's
so,
then
why
shouldn't
smalis
have
gone
the
other
way?
because
they
can
send
it
right
back
to
exactly
the
same
judge.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
jury
is
the
trier
of
fact.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
on
the
hypothesis
before,
you're
saying
if
they
don't
discharge
the
jury
and
it
can
go
back
to
them,
no
double
jeopardy
problem.
in
smalis,
it's
going
to
be
the
same
judge.
it
was
a
bench
trial.
it
should
have
come
out
the
other
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
doesn't
the...
the
prosecution
gets
its
full
and
fair
opportunity
if
we
have
a
rule
that
says
to
trial
judges,
when
you
make
a
ruling
on
acquittal,
you
better
be
serious
and
you
better
not
make
a
snap
judgment,
think
it
over,
because
once
you've
done
it,
it
sticks?
why...
why
doesn't
the
prosecution
have
a
perfectly
fair
opportunity
under
that
rule?
everybody
knows
where
he
stands
and
judges,
we
hope,
are
going
to
be
careful.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
the
distinction
the
right
to
rely?
