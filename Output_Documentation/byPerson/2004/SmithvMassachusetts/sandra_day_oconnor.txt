but
your
answer
just
isn't
responsive.
when
has
it
become
final?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when?
when
the
judge
says
something,
when
he
writes
something?
when
does
it
become
final?
at
what
point
in
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
your
proposed
rule?
you
haven't
said
yet.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
one
thing.
just
when
does
it
become
final?
let's
limit
it
to
one
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
was
your
client--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--was
your
client
prejudiced
in
any
way
by
not
putting
on
some
evidence
that
the...
he
would
have
put
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
answer
the
question
for
once.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--you
another
question
here?
there...
there
were
three
charges
against
your
client,
as
i
understand
it.
unlawful
possession
of
a
firearm.
that's
the
one
we're
talking
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
assault
and
battery
by
means
of
a
dangerous
weapon.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
jury
convicted
on
all
three.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
he
was
given
concurrent
sentences.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
would
you
explain
to
me
if
there's
any
practical
effect
to
your
winning
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
think
prejudice
to
the
defendant
should
be
a
factor,
and
if
the
defendant
is
misled
by
what
the
judge
says
into
not
putting
on
part
of
the
case
that
otherwise
would
have
been
put
on,
that's
a
pretty
serious
matter.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
matter
if
the...
if
the
ruling
is
conveyed
to
the
jury
even
though
the
jury
isn't
discharged?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
how
do
we...
how
does
smalis
fit
into
this
discussion?
i
thought
in
smalis
in
a
bench
trial,
we
said
it
was
final.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
smith
versus
massachusetts
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
