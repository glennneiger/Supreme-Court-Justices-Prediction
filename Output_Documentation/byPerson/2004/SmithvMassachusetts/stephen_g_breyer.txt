justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they've
held
that
in
this
case.
we
have
a
massachusetts
decision.
it's
their
law
and
under
their
law
in
massachusetts,
the
judge
can
revise
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it
isn't
their
law,
then
i
don't
know
how...
why
they
affirmed
this
conviction
rather
than
reversing
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
i
mean,
i...
i
take
it
that
it
is
their
law,
otherwise
i'd
see
reversal,
wouldn't
i,
and
not
affirmance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
in
other
words,
they're
saying
that
in
this
case...
how
could
there
not
be
prejudice?
he
had
another
trial.
i
mean...
how
could...
i
don't
understand
this
from
beginning
to
end
then.
but
let
me
go
back
to
my
original
question.
what
rule
do
you
propose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
saying
is,
for
double
jeopardy
purposes--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--an
acquittal
in
your
view
is
an
acquittal
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
when?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
asking
you
for
a...
i'd
have
to
write...
if
i
agreed
with
you,
i'd
have
to
say
we
have
here
a
judge
who
changed
his
mind.
under
the
clause
of
the
constitution,
a
judge
cannot
change
his
mind
when.
now,
go
ahead.
now,
fill
in
the
blanks.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
according...
i
know
what
their
rule
is.
their
rule
is
a
judge
can
change
his
mind
up
to
the
point
that
the
jury
is
dismissed,
something
like
that.
i
understand
that.
now,
i
want
to
know
what
your
rule...
is
your
rule
a
judge
cannot
change
his
mind
once
he
writes
the
word
acquittal
on
a
piece
of
paper,
even
if
he
says,
oh
my
god,
i
meant
to
say
no
acquittal?
too
late.
okay,
now,
so
i
want
to
know
what
your
rule
is.
is
that
the
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
what
is
the
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
further
proceeding
if
he
writes
the
word
acquittal,
i
guess
until
he
changes
his
mind.
so
3
minutes
later,
he
says
i
change
my
mind.
now
there
are
further
proceedings.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
need
to
write
a
simple
rule.
all
i'm
trying
to
get
from
you
is
what
is
your
rule.
is
your
rule
that
when
a
judge
writes
the
word
acquittal...
an
acquittal,
by
the
way,
happens
to
mean
there's
nothing
left
for
the
jury
to
do
on
that
charge.
that's
what
it
means.
when
he
writes
the
word
acquittal,
he
cannot
change
it.
is
that
your
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
and
what
is
your
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not
understanding
my
question
then.
imagine
a
case
in
which
a
judge
writes
the
word
acquittal.
now,
half
an
hour
later,
he
thinks,
oh,
my
god,
what
have
i
done.
the
jury
is
still
sitting
there.
of
course,
they're
sitting
there
because
he
hasn't
had
a
chance
to
dismiss
them
yet.
they
happened
to
be
having
lunch
or
something.
is
it
final?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
not
final.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
say
that
again.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he
wrote
the
word
acquittal.
there's
nothing
more
for
anybody
to
do
until
he
changes
the
word.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
try
single-count.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
he
is.
he
writes
the
word
acquittal
and
the
jury
says,
oh,
what
do
we
do
now?
go
home,
says
the
clerk.
now,
before
they
can
get
out
the
door
or
anything
else
happens,
before
they
get
out
the
door,
he
says,
oh,
my
god,
i
made
a
mistake.
can
he
do
that
under
your
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
what
i
thought
from
reading
your
brief,
which
you're
confirming,
is
your
rule...
once
the
judge
says
acquittal,
that's
the
end
of
it.
if
he
decides
3
seconds
later,
he
cannot
change
his
mind.
now,
that
rule
to
me
is
inconsistent
with
most
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i
was
thinking
is...
i
mean,
here
a
judge...
i
guess
she
was
harried
in
the
trial,
she's
thinking
to
herself,
well,
let's
see,
is
there
any
evidence
here
that
this
was
less
than
the
shotgun...
this
was
not
a
shotgun.
you
know,
it
had
to
be
a
barrel
less
than
16
inches.
so
is
there
any
evidence
here
of
the
shotgun?
and
she,
i
guess,
forgot
that
there
was
a
lot
of
evidence
that
it
was
a
pistol.
now,
there
aren't
many
pistols
that
are
16
inches
long.
so
she's
thinking,
something
may
be
missing
here.
she's
a
little
uncertain,
but
she
writes
acquittal,
and
then
a
few
minutes
later,
she
thinks,
let's
say,
oh,
my
god,
there
was
all
that
evidence
about
the
pistol.
so
i
shouldn't
have
done
that.
i
mean,
how...
how
is
a
judge
like
that,
a
hypothetical...
what's
she
supposed
to
do?
is
she
supposed
to
say,
i
better
not
enter
anything,
because
after
all,
i
don't
care
if
the
defendant
has
to
produce
a
case?
or
is
she
supposed
to
enter
something
and
think,
well,
i
could
change
my
mind
before
it's
over?
or
what
is
she
supposed
to
do?
she
just
thinks
she
made
a
mistake.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
here
there
was
evidence
there
was
a
pistol,
but
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
was
evidence
it
was
a
pistol.
so
i...
i
would
have
thought,
reading
this,
that
there
was
evidence.
that's
beside
the
point,
but
i'm...
i'm
just
using
it
as
an
example
where
a
judge
might
think
she
made
a
mistake.
she
thought
there
was
no
evidence
that
it
wasn't
a
shotgun,
and
i
guess
she
forgot
that
there
was
evidence
it
was
a
pistol
and
a
pistol
is
not
a
shotgun.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
quite
sure...
not
quite
sure
then
why
she
wrote
down
there
was
no
evidence
it
wasn't
a
shotgun,
but
she
had
some
reason.
and
now
a
few
minutes
later,
she
thinks,
boy,
whatever
my
reason
is,
it
couldn't
have
been
that
good.
or
maybe
she
thinks
that
that's
a
reason
an
hour
from
now
or
maybe
a
day
from
now.
what's
the
line?
suppose
she
thinks
of
it
a
second
from
now.
suppose
she
thinks
the
instant
she
writes
acquittal,
she
thought,
oh,
my
god,
a
pistol
is
not
a
shotgun.
of
course,
it
isn't.
i
know
that.
i
better
change
it.
is
it
a
second
from
now?
is
it
she
can
never
change
it
no
matter
what
once
the
pen
leaves
the
paper?
what's
your
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
care
whether
it's
single-count
or
double-count
or
triple-count.
i
want
to
know
what...
how
you
see
it,
not
how
i
see
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
excellent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
excellent.
that
was
an
excellent
answer.
[laughter]
now,
i
would
like
to
know,
given
that
answer,
why
is
this
final
under
state
procedure
because
it
seems
as
if
the
state
courts
of
massachusetts
have
said,
no,
it
is
not
a
constitutional
error
to
go
and
look
into
this
again.
she
can
change
her
mind.
and
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
focus
on
because
i
agree
that
that
was
a
good
explanation
of
the
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
thinking
of
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
took
justice
scalia's
rule
and
i
said,
that's
the
rule.
now,
i
would
say
that's
the
rule
of
a
federal
law.
very
well.
that
turns
on
your
decision
here
being
final
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
but
it
seems
to
me
we
have
state
courts
here
saying,
at
least
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
it
isn't
final
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
and
therefore,
i
want
to
know
how
we
reach
your
conclusion
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
that
necessary?
i...
i
mean,
that's
what
i
think
is
the
difficult
question
here.
can
you
say
that
it's
final
for
purposes
of
the
decision-maker
outside
that
courtroom,
namely
an
appellate
court,
but
it's
not
final
in
respect
to
the
judge
having
a
right
to
change
his
mind
within
the
court?
that...
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to
me,
but
i
don't
know
if
it's
possible
to
get
there.
why
not?
i...
i
think,
well,
the
reason
is
that
you
want
judges
to
be
able
to
reconsider
things
and
you
don't
have
that
problem
when
you're
talking
about
an
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
is
there
any...
is
there
any,
in
other
words,
to
reconcile
our
case
that
you're
talking
about,
smalis?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
about
a
judge
who
thinks...
should
the
judge...
should
a
judge
in
trial
be
able
to
change
his
mind
as
long
as
the
jury
is
still
there?
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should
you
be
able
to
take
an
appeal
in
the
same
circumstance
while
the
jury
is
still
there?
no.
now,
suppose
a
judge
thinks
both
those
things.
is
that
judge,
like
me,
for
example,
hopelessly
confused?
[laughter]
is
the
judge
thinking
contradictory
things
or
is
there
a
way
of
reconciling
those
two
instincts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by
the
way,
if
it's
constitutional,
it's
pretty
easy
to
see
a
state
might
well
say,
let's
do
that,
what
a
good
idea.
i
mean,
they
might
think
it's
a
good
idea.
i
don't
know
what
people
think
is
a
good
idea.
we'll
provide
for
interlocutory
appeals
right
in
the
middle
of
cases
because
the
prosecution
can
never
appeal
at
the
end
of
the
case.
that's
really
unfair.
and
we'll
do
this
little
thing
here,
and
that
way
we
give
the
prosecutor
a
chance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you
think
it's...
i'm
just
inconsistent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
reason
you
didn't
want
a
fairly
simple
rule
that
i
was
thinking
of?
i'll
tell
you
what
it
is
and
you'll
tell
me
honestly
why
you
don't.
it's
final.
the
word
acquittal
is...
is
final
if
the
jury
has
been
discharged
or
the
decision
is
sent
to
another
body
for
review.
one
or
the
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
so
you
haven't
found
something
in
your
research
that
suggests
that...
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
could
be
a
problem
that
you
have
to
have
a
fair
chance
to
present
evidence
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
there
are
a
lot
of
rules
in
massachusetts
that
deal
with
that.
they
can't...
you
have
to
be
fair
to
the
defendant
in...
is
that
right?
