justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
the
case
of
smith
against
massachusetts.
mr.
nathanson.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
also
important
to
know,
though,
whether
the
defendant
has
to
put
on
a
case
or
not?
so
he
can't
just
reserve
judgment.
i'll
tell
you
after
the
trial
is
over
whether
you
should
put
a
case
on
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
ms.
neaves.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
in
the
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--we
have
before
us
the
state
allowed
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
prosecution
right
after
the
judge's
ruling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
conceivably
they
could
allow
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
acquittal
at
the
close
of
the
prosecution's
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
in
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
this
case
the
judge
did
not
reconsider
until
the
end
of
the
defense
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
during
that
period,
did
the
defense
lawyer
have
the
right
to
rely
on
the
acquittal
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
put
in
defensive
evidence
on
the
count
from
which
he
thought
his
client
had
been
acquitted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
if
the
double
jeopardy
clause
did
apply,
if
it
were
treated
as
a
true
acquittal,
he
could
just
say,
well,
we
can
forget
about
that,
send
your
witnesses
home,
we
won't
have
to
worry
about
it.
i
understand
under
your
view
they
could
send
the
witnesses
home,
and
a
week...
a
week
later
the
judge
could
say,
well,
we
haven't
submitted
it
to
the
jury,
i've
decided
to
change
my
mind.
you
could
bring
all
those
witnesses
back.
that's
the
way
you
think
it
should
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
if
the
defendant
is
acquitted,
the
remedy
is
a
retrial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
the...
if
the
massachusetts
law
provided
that
the
motions
at
the
end
of
the
prosecution's
case
shall
not
be
ruled
on
unless...
after
they're
written
briefs
filed
by
both
sides
and
they
have
3
days
of
argument.
you'd
still
have
the
same
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms.
neaves.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr....
mr.
srinivasan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your...
your
colleague?
supposing
we're
not
in
massachusetts,
but
we're
in
another
state
that
provided
for
an
interlocutory
appeal
immediately
after
the
judge's
ruling
in
this
case.
would...
would
you
have
the
same
appraisal
of
the
case
on
those
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
would
you
still
say
it
was
not
final,
even
though
it
was
sufficiently
final
for
appellate
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
question
is
assuming
a
state
procedure
in
which
the
interlocutory
appeal
was
permissible,
you...
you
would
say
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
bar
that
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
all
these
cases...
we've
had
several,
not
too
many
over
the...
the
whole
line
of
cases...
and
the
trial
judge
has
always
committed
a
rather
plain
error.
and
we
all
have
the
case
where
if
you
just
try
to
decide
whether
it's
a
just
result,
you'd
always
say
no.
a
case
just
like
this.
the
judge
made
a
mistake,
but
we've
always
said
that's
not
something
we...
we
look
at.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say
as
a
typical
matter
these
double
jeopardy
claims
arise
in
cases
in
which
the
judge
made
a
rather
plain
error,
and
when
you
look
at
it
later,
you
say,
gee,
he
goofed.
and
so
i'm
not
sure
we
should
consider
the
plainness
of
the
error
or
the
fact
that
they...
they
do
mistakes
because
they
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
value
of
finality
is
what
is
really
at
stake
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
here
it
was
not
a
matter
of
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
here
it
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--thank
you.
mr.
nathanson,
you
have
about
3
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nathanson,
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
