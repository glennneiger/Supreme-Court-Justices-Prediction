mr.
david
j.
nathanson
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
trial
judge
found
melvin
smith
not
guilty
on
the
merits
and
unequivocally
so.
that
acquittal
entitled
melvin
smith
to
repose.
instead,
what
he
got
was
a
moving
target.
the
trial
judge's
later
reconsideration
of
smith's
acquittal
placed
him
in
jeopardy
for
that
same
offense
twice.
smith's
position
on
the
matter
is
completely
faithful
to
this
court's
precedent,
and
it
makes
sense
in
the
real-world
practice
of
criminal
law.
the
state,
on
the
other
hand,
asks
this
court
to
make
exceptions
to
the
rule,
long-held,
that
acquittals
terminate
jeopardy.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
well,
first
of
all,
obviously,
that's
a
civil
case.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
doesn't
apply
to
civil
cases.
second
of
all...
except
with
some
rare
exceptions.
what
i
think
the
best
way
to...
to
really
define
finality
here...
and...
and
whatever
finality
is,
i
really
do
think
we...
we
do
have
it
here
because
this
court
has
said
an
acquittal
under
martin
linen,
a
resolution,
correct
or
not,
of
some
or
all
if
the
factual
elements--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--allowed,
and
it
was
attested
by
the
clerk.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
no,
your
honor.
the...
the
formal
rule,
which
is
not
always
observed,
but
the
formal
rule
is
that
it
must
be
recorded
on...
on
the
docket
and
announced
in
an
open
courtroom.
that
happened
here.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
well,
to
answer
the
first
question,
i
think
that
if...
if
such
a
statute
were
enacted,
i'm
willing
to
grant,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
double
jeopardy
problem.
it
may
in
a
later
case...
and
you
know,
i'd
be
very
interested
in
that...
a
problem
under
a
combination
of
jackson
and
winship
because
the
defendant
may
have
a...
a
right
to
that
determination.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
well,
first
of
all,
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
is
the
one
who
promulgated
the
rules
in
this
case.
rule
25(a)
is
promulgated
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
of--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--well,
that
was
the
massachusetts
appeals
court,
i
might
add.
second
of
all,
the
rule
itself
requires
that
the
motion
shall
be
ruled
upon
at
that
time.
it
says
nothing
about
reconsideration,
and
clearly--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--actually--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--i'm
not
sure
i
know
either,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
actually
i
think
what
they
did--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--your
honor,
is
they
assumed
that
there
was
an
error
in...
in...
when
dealing
strictly
with
the
rule,
at
the...
at
the
end
of
the
section
dealing
with
this,
they
assume
that
there
was
an
error
and
said
no
prejudice,
which
i've
contended
in
the
brief--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--as
for
finality,
the
rule
i
propose
is,
first
of
all,
we
have
to
start
with
the
basic
foundation,
which
is
an
acquittal,
under
martin
linen
with
a
resolution--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--yes.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
there's...
there's
three
things
that
i
think
court
should
look
at.
one,
first
of
all,
because
we
treat
acquittals
from
the
bench
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
the
same
as
acquittals
from
a
jury,
a
prosecutor
can
poll
a
jury
immediately
after
the
verdict.
a
prosecutor
clearly--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--yes.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
the...
your
first
question...
the
constitutional
point
of
no
return,
shall
we
say,
is
further
proceedings.
if
there
is
an
acquittal
and
there
are
further
proceedings--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--well,
then
at
that
point
you
look
to
other
indicia
of
finality
that
this...
this
court
referenced
that
in...
in
vincent,
and
that...
that's
generally
compliance
with
state
procedure.
compliance
with
state
procedures--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--no.
the
rule
is
that
the--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--the
rule
is
that
the
judge
cannot
change
it,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
if
there
are
further
proceedings.
in
a
multi-count
case,
count
a
is
acquitted.
we
initiate
further
proceedings
on
count
b
and
c.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
it
ripens
at
the--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--what
i'm
suggesting
is--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--what...
what
i'm
suggesting
is...
is
two
things.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
it...
it
becomes
final
when
there
are
further
proceedings
initiated.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
the...
the...
that
is
the
line
drawn
by
most
of
the
lower
courts.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
it
is
not
final--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--if...
if
the
defense
has
not
been
forced
at
that
point
to
choose
to
rest
or
put
on
a
case.
that
is
the--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--if
the
defense
is
forced
to
rest
or
put
on
a
case.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
well,
i
think
we're
talking
about
two
separate
things.
is
your
honor's
question
presupposing
a
single-count
case
or
a
multi-count?
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
okay.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
i'm
not
entirely
sure
of
the
answer
to
the
question,
your
honor,
but
i...
i
think,
first
of
all,
we
look
at
compliance
with
state
procedure.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
if
we're
talking
about
a
clerical
error,
your
honor,
the
massachusetts
rules
and
the
federal
rules
provide
for
correction
of
clerical
errors.
what...
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
a
clerical
error,
but
the
judge
clearly
intended
to
do
what
she
did.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
may
i
begin,
your
honor--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--yes,
your
honor.
there...
there
was
a
defense
that
he
essentially
forfeited
by
not
being
aware
that
the
judge
was
going
to,
at
some
point--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--your
honor,
counsel
for
co-defendant,
felicia
brown,
presented
just
such
a
defense
and
she
was
acquitted.
she
presented
the
defense
that
melvin
smith
did
not
shoot
christopher
robinson,
but
if
melvin--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--but
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
wasn't
risky,
your
honor,
because
the...
this
jury
was
willing
to
consider
an
alternative
defense
that
would
have
otherwise
appeared
as
a
concession.
they
did
not
take
it
as
a
concession.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
i'd
just
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
but...
but
the...
the
larger
point
is
if
we
allow
this
rule
in
general,
we
are
going
to
engender
serious
problems.
i'm
saying
that
there...
that
there
was
some
reliance
here,
but
we're
going
to
engender
much
more
serious
problems
in
other
cases
where
a
defendant
perhaps
presents
a
defense
that
is
helpful
to
the
remaining
charges,
but
damaging
on
the
acquitted
charge.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
what
massachusetts
law
says
in...
in
the
zavala
case,
they
said
that
there
is
not
a
right
to
reopen
where
the
judge
has
determined
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
second
of
all--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--he
didn't
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
well,
i...
i
don't
think
prejudice
is
a
factor
in
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence.
either
the
defendant
has
been
placed
twice
in
jeopardy
or
he
has
not.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
because
if...
if
discharge
of
the
jury
is
the
rule,
then
the
judge
can
reconsider
an
acquittal
at
any
point
in
a
defendant's
case.
2
weeks
into
a
defense
case,
the
judge
could
reconsider
an
acquittal.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
i
don't
think
that's
permissible,
your
honor.
it...
it
is...
granted,
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
that
it's
permissible
for
states
to
order
judges
to
withhold
rulings,
that
there
shall
be
no
ruling
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
prior
to
the
return
of
a
jury
verdict.
louisiana,
for
example,
does
that,
and
i
think
oklahoma.
but
for
the
supreme
judicial...
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
to
say
that
an
acquittal
has
no
force
is
simply
straight
contravening
what
this
court
has
said.
it's...
it's
essentially
a
continuing
jeopardy
argument.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
i
think
that
is
permissible
because--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
judges
are...
are
intelligent
people.
they
read
the
pleadings
beforehand.
justice
donovan
clearly
read
the
pleading
beforehand
in
this
case,
and
she...
she
was
prepared
to
ask
for
argument
on
it.
i
don't
think
that
judges
do
these
things
so
precipitously
that
they
are
not
going
to
be
confident
in
their
ruling.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
and
judges
should
be
cautious,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
that...
that
is,
in
fact,
the
point,
justice
stevens.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
a
constitutional
policy
of
finality
for
the
defendant's
benefit.
he...
that's
what
this
court
said
in
jorn.
the
defendant
has
to
know
whether
he...
he's
defending
a
case.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
he
did
not.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
yes.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
yes.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
yes.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
there
is
a
practical
effect.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
firearm
possession
offenses
in
massachusetts
have
restrictions
as
to
parole
and
good
time
deductions
that
the
other
offenses
do
not
have.
so
there
is
a
practical
effect,
aside
from
the
fact
that
it's
a...
it's
a
conviction
on
his
record,
your
honor.
moving
on,
justice
breyer,
just
to
address
the
question
that
you
were
asking
me,
i
think
perhaps
a
good
way
to
phrase
it
is...
is
if
the
first
factual
resolution
of
the
elements
of...
of
the
offense
results
in
acquittal,
there
can
be
no
further
proceedings.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
so
your
hypothetical
is
that
there's
evidence
of
two
guns?
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
i'm
sorry.
yes,
in
this
case--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--she...
she
clearly
didn't
forget.
the
prosecutor
said
to
her
the
evidence
was
testified
to
that
it
was
a
pistol,
it
was
a
revolver,
it
was
a.32--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--in
a
single-count
case,
your
honor--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--it...
compliance
with
state
procedure
informs
the
inquiry
and
once...
once
we
have
what
is
determined
to
be
a
resolution--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
correct,
your
honor.
that's
what--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--if...
if
state
procedure,
as
in
this--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--yes.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
well,
there's...
there
clearly
is
a
line
beyond
which
the
state
cannot
go,
and
that's
what
justice
brennan
was
talking
about
in
his
concurrence
in
lydon.
he
said
the...
the
state
cannot
fashion
a
procedure
whereby
the
judge
never
discharges
the
jury,
and
in...
in
kepner,
this
court
held
that
the
philippine
procedure
of
withholding
finality
from
an
acquittal
in
a
bench
trial
also
violated
the
constitution.
so
state
procedure
does
not
control.
it
is
sufficient
but
not
necessary.
if...
if
you
comply
with
state
procedure
to
say
this
is...
this
is
an
acquittal,
okay,
it's
an
acquittal.
if
you
do
not
comply
with
state
procedure,
it
can
still
be
an
acquittal
under
federal
law.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
no.
it...
it
is
a
federal
question,
your
honor.
this
court--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--this
court
said
that
in
smalis
quite
clearly.
if
i...
if
i
may,
two
things
and
then
i'd
like
to
reserve.
but
the...
the
state
would
have
this
court
draw
a
distinction
between
acquittals
by
a
judge
and
acquittals
by
a
jury.
that
simply
has
been
rejected
by
this
court
numerous
times.
sanabria,
rumsey.
an
acquittal
is
an
acquittal.
again,
the...
the
state
would
have
this
court
draw
distinctions
between
acquittals
based
on
law
and
acquittals
based
on
fact.
sanabria
unequivocally
rejected
that.
sanabria
says
that
in
fact
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
not
a
legal
defense.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
justice
stevens,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'll
try
to
be
as
brief
as
i
can.
the
argument
about
inherent
authority
to
reconsider
an
acquittal
really
has
it
backwards.
inherent
authority
bends
to
the
constitution.
the
constitution
does
not
bend
to
a
judge's
inherent
authority.
second,
the...
the
government
is
trying
to
substitute
a
standard
here
of
a
second
proceeding,
which
is
not
this
court's
standard.
this
court's
standard
is
further
proceedings
after
an
acquittal,
including
resumption
of
the
same
trial.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
smalis.
the
government
is
also
trying
to
move
this
case
into
the
particular
tribunal
analysis.
that
comes
from
cases
that
are
mistrials.
this
is
an
acquittal.
this
is
not
a
particular
tribunal
case.
as
to
the
judge
resolving
all
the
issues
in
a
bench
trial
and...
and
that's
why
that...
that
acquittal
would
be
more
final
than
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict,
it
was
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict.
it
was
a
demurrer
in
smalis.
it
was
the
exact
same
standard
that
the
judge
applied
in
that
case.
as
to
prejudice,
prejudice
has
never
been
a
factor
in
this
court's
double
jeopardy
analysis.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in...
in
one
of
the
really
classical
statements,
ex
parte
lange,
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
that
case,
that
looks
like
complete
gamesmanship.
the
defendant
was
sentenced
to
a
jail
term
and
a
fine
when
the...
the
statute
only
authorized
a
jail
term
or
a
fine.
he
said,
oh,
i'll
pay...
i'll
pay
the
fine.
it's
a
get-out-of-jail-free
card.
there's
complete
gamesmanship,
but
prejudice
was
not
a
factor.
and
in
fact,
this
court
has
said
prejudice
is
not
open
to
judicial
examination
in
double
jeopardy
cases.
as
to
honing,
in...
in
fact,
in
rumsey--
mr.
david
j.
nathanson
--honing.
not
the
name
of
a
case,
your
honor.
but
whether
or
not
the
government
has
honed
its
cased
through...
and...
and
they
would
say
evidentiary
honing.
but
it's
not
evidentiary
honing.
in
rumsey,
it
was
only
argument
that
was
presented
at...
at
the
remand
after
acquittal.
justice
souter,
i
want
to
heartily
endorse
the...
the
way
you
phrased
what
the
rule
should
be,
which
is,
trial
judges,
you
ought
to
take
this
seriously.
pretermitting
the
prosecution's
case
is
a
very
serious
matter.
you
cannot
take
it
back.
so
think
about
it.
do
it
right
the
first
time.
as
to...
to
rule
25
itself,
it's
true
that
the...
the
judges
can't
reserve.
so
what
they
do
as...
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
massachusetts
is
they
simply
deny,
and...
and
they
deny
the
first
one
and
they
have
two
more
opportunities,
one
at
the
close
of
the
defendant's
case
and
they
have
an
opportunity
at
the
close
of...
after
the
jury
has
returned
a
verdict.
at
each
of
those
steps,
they
can
make
a
motion
for
acquittal.
as
to
the
full
and
fair
opportunity,
this
court
said
in
martin
linen
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
try
the
case.
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
have
it
proceed
to
verdict.
i'm
just
taking
that
straight
from
martin
linen.
as
to,
finally,
whether
or
not
state
law
sort
of
insulates
this
from
federal...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
