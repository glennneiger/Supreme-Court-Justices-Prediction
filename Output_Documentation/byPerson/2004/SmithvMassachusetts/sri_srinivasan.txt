mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
trial
court
in
this
case
was
permitted
to
correct
its
erroneous
ruling
in
favor
of
the
defendant
on
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
because
the
prosecution
is
entitled
to
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
prove
its
a
case,
that's
a
value--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--would
we
have
the
same
appraisal
as
the
state?
we
don't--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no.
we...
we
think
that
the
court's
holding
in
smalis
applies
equally
to
jury
trials
and
to
bench
trials
such
that
an
appeal,
an
interlocutory
appeal,
in
the
midst
of
a
jury
trial
would
not
be
permissible.
but
we
also
think
that
there
is
a
sound
basis
for
drawing
a
distinction
between--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right,
because
we
read
that
to
be
the
holding
of
smalis.
but
we
think
there's
a
basis
for
distinguishing
between
appeals
on
one
hand
and
continuing
proceedings
before
the
initial
tribunal
on
the
other
hand.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
drawn
that
distinction
in
swisher
v.
brady
where
it
initially
said
that
the
two-stage
system
of
adjudication
is...
in
maryland
that
was
at
issue
in
that
case
was
permissible
because
it
entailed
continued
proceedings
before
the
initial
tribunal
rather
than
an
appeal
to
a
second
tribunal.
and
the
court
specifically
distinguished
its
prior
decisions
in
jenkins
v.
the
united
states
and
kepner,
both
of
which
involved
appellate
review.
and
the
other
basis
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
appeals
on
one
hand
and
reconsiderations
by
the
trial
court
on
the
other
is
historical
tradition.
i
think
the
court
could
look
to
history
and
history
would
show
that
on
one
hand
trial
courts
have
always
had
inherent
authority
to
reconsider
their
mid-trial
rulings
because
the
practical
exigencies
of
trial
are
such
that
trial
courts
inevitably
will
err
on
occasion,
and
the
ends
of
justice
require
trial
courts
to
have
the
authority
to
revisit
their
mid-trial
rulings.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
we
would,
justice
kennedy,
but
it
raises
a
distinct
problem
because
one
value
that's
served
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
the
defendant's
interest
in
preventing
the
prosecution
from
honing
its
evidentiary
case
by
repeated
efforts.
and
if
the
trial
judge
were
permitted
to
reopen
the
case
to
give
the
prosecution
that
opportunity,
it
at
least
would
implicate
that
interest.
now,
we
still
think
that
the
proper
line
is
jury
discharge,
but
we
understand
that
that
hypothetical
would
present
a
distinct
interest.
now,
with
respect
to
historical
tradition
on
appeals,
the
historical
tradition
is
clear
that
the
government
has
lacked
authority
at
common
law
to
take
an
appeal
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
this
court
relied
on
that
common
law
tradition
as
early
as
sanges
v.
the
united
states
and
it's
repeated
that
understanding
in
carroll
v.
the
united
states
and
arizona
v.
manypenny,
and
that's
why
the
court
construes
statutory
grants
of
authority
to
the
government
to
take
an
appeal
in
criminal
cases
quite
narrowly.
and
so
i
think
the
court
could
draw
a
distinction
between
reconsiderations
by
the
trial
court
and
appeals
by
looking
to
historical
tradition,
and
the
court
often
looks
at
history
to
shape
the
contours
of
double
jeopardy
protections.
and
that
would
afford
the
case...
the
court
a
basis
for
saying
that
in
smalis,
while
appeals
were
forbidden,
in
this
case
trial
court
reconsideration
should
be
permitted.
and
i
think
the
lens
through
which
the
court
would
do
that
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
the
valued
interest
in
giving
the
prosecution
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
prove
its
case
in
the
sense
that
while
that
full
and
fair
opportunity
may
exclude
an
appeal,
because
the
court
held
as
much
in
smalis,
it
doesn't
exclude
reconsiderations.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
souter,
we
think
a
constitutional
rule
that
would
turn
on
the
definitiveness
of
a
trial
court
ruling
would
be
flawed
in
three
respects.
first,
the
line
between
a
definitive
ruling
and
a
tentative
ruling
is
not
altogether
clear,
and
we've
outlined
in
our
brief
at
page
24
in
a
lengthy
footnote
a
variety
of
factual
scenarios
that
come
from
real
cases
where
trial
judges,
as
they
often
do,
rendered
a
ruling
on
a
motion
for
acquittal
orally,
and
whether
you
think
that
ruling
was
definitive
or
tentative
might
depend
on
which
page
of
the
transcript
you
happen
to
be
looking
at.
but
even
if
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
in
which
the
ruling
clearly
falls
on
the
definitive
side
of
the
line,
you'd
still
have
the
problem
that
a
trial
court
might
be
convinced
that
it's
correct
and
rule
definitively
but
still
be
incorrect.
trial
courts
make
mistakes.
that's
why
this
issue
comes
up
as
often
as
it
does.
for
example,
in
this
case--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't...
i'm
not
quite
sure
i'm
following
what
you're
saying,
justice
stevens,
because--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--but...
but
i
don't...
but
the
reason
why
the
court
accepts
errors
in
some
situations
is
because
there's
some
other
value
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it's
not
just
the
value
of
finality.
it's
that,
for
example,
if
the
judge
makes
an
error
and
then
the
jury
is
discharged,
it's
the
value
that
the
defendant
has
in
obtaining
a
result
from
the
particular
tribunal.
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
the
trial
judge
can
correct
for
error
within
the...
within
a
matter
of
minutes,
at
least
in
some
situations,
there
would
be
no
double
jeopardy
purpose
served--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--in
this--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no.
i
acknowledge
in
this
case
it
wasn't,
but
it
might
well
be
in
some
cases.
for
example,
we
cite
a
decision
of
the
washington
supreme
court,
state
v.
collins,
which
involves
essentially
the
same
scenario
as
this
case,
but
the
only
distinction
was
that
after
the
trial
judge
initially
announced
her
ruling,
the
prosecution
had
the
precedent
in
hand
and
within
a
span
of
10
minutes,
the
trial
judge
was
able
to
realize
her
error
and
to
correct
her
ruling
and
reinstate
the
charge.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
would
matter,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
necessarily
preclude
the
prosecution
from
going
forward
on
the
charge
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
the
question
would
be
one
of
due
process
and
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
the
third
is...
it's
an
issue
that
you
raised
earlier,
justice
kennedy.
it's
that
this
case
might
look
different
as
an
atmospheric
matter
if
the
trial
judge
at
the
time
she
rendered
her
ruling
had
said,
i'm
ruling
in
the
defendant's
favor,
but
i
may
reconsider
this
decision
at
a
later
point
in
the
proceedings.
now,
that
might
be
seen
to
fall
on
the
tentative
side
of
the
line,
but
that's
exactly
the
effect
of
this...
of
the
trial
judge's
ruling
as
a
matter
of
massachusetts
law.
and
we
don't
think
there's
a
constitutionally
significant
distinction
between
a
trial
judge
explicitly
saying
that
a
ruling
can
be
reconsidered
and
state
law
saying
that
the
ruling
can
be
reconsidered.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it...
there...
there...
that
would
be
the
basis
of
a
claim,
justice
souter,
but
the
right
to
rely
is,
in
essence,
a
notice
prejudice
sort
of
claim
and
that
could
be
handled
in
the
way
that
trial
courts
typically
handle
claims
by
the
defendant
that
they've
detrimentally
relied
on
an
initial
ruling
the
trial
court
has
subsequently
reconsidered.
it
would
be
equally
the
case,
for
example,
as
the
state
mentioned
with
respect
to
an
evidentiary
ruling
that
barred
the
prosecution
from
introducing
a
category
of
evidence,
but
then
the
trial
judge,
later
in
the
proceedings,
wanted
to
revisit
that
ruling.
the
question
would
be
whether
revisiting
the
ruling
resulted
in
prejudice
to
the
defendant
because
the
defendant
had
detrimentally
relied
on
the
trial
judge's
initial
determination.
and
we
don't
think
that
prejudice
inquiry
is
meaningfully
different
when
you're
dealing
with
evidentiary
rulings
as
when
you're...
as
when
you're
dealing
with
the
reinstatement
of
a
previously
acquitted
charge.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it
would
depend.
if...
if
the
bench
trial
judge
were
making
a
mid-trial
ruling,
as...
as
in
this
case,
then
the
judge
could
change
his
or
her
mind.
but
if
the
bench
trial
judge
were
resolving
the
entire
case
and
entered--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no.
the...
the...
i
think
the
constitution
would
step
in
and
impose
a
line
at
some
point,
and
probably
the
best
indicator
is
a
rule--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
can't
be
discharge
of
the
jury,
but
i
think
where
the
court
would
look,
first
and
foremost,
in
defining
a
line
for
bench
trials,
if
the
issue
would
ever
arise,
would
be
a
ruling
that
would
essentially
have
resulted
in
discharge
of
the
jury
if
the
trial
were
before
a
jury.
and
for
example,
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
was,
justice
o'connor,
for
purposes
of
an
appeal,
and
that's
why
i
think
the
critical
distinction
between
smalis
and
this
case
is
that
where
the
prosecution
might
not
have
authority
to
take
an
appeal
from
a
ruling
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
in
a
bench
trial,
that...
that
would
be
part
of
the
inquiry,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
would
also
point,
by
the
way,
to...
can
i
just
finish
the
thought,
justice
stevens?
to
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
32(k)(1),
which
says
that
when
a
bench
trial...
when
a
judge
sitting
in
a
bench
trial
issues
a
ruling
that
finds
a
defendant
not
guilty,
that
ruling
will
discharge
the
defendant.
and
i
think
a
discharge
of
the
defendant
would
be
one
of
critical
consideration.
thank
you.
