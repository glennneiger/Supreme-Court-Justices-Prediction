are
we
talking
about
section
1956(i)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
doesn't
it
allow
it
to
be
brought
where
venue
would
lie
if
the
completed
money
laundering
offense
that's
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
has
been
accomplished
or
anywhere
an
overt
act
was
committed?
isn't
it
an
either/or?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
don't
have
to
read
it
as
requiring
venue.
it's
just
requiring
an
overt
act.
if
there
is
an
overt
act,
then
venue
will
lie,
but
it
also
will
lie
where
the
completed
offense
would
have
occurred.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
shabani
comes
pretty
close,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--like
this
it
seems
to
me
contains
no
express
requirement
of
an
overt
act,
and
we've
said,
indeed,
none
is
required
and
that
at
common
law
it
wasn't
required.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why
would
we
read
it
in
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
have
two
consolidated
cases,
whitfield
versus
united
states
and
hall
versus
united
states
that
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
in
march
1999,
a
federal
grand
jury
indicted
the
petitioners
for
conspiracy
to
launder
money
in
violation
of
the
18
u.s.
code
section
1956(h).
at
trial,
the
government
presented
evidence
that
the
petitioners
helped
to
run
an
entity
known
as
greater
ministries
international
church,
gmic.
gmic
ran
a
gifting
program
that
took
in
over
$400
million
between
1996
and
1999.
under
the
program,
the
petitioners
induced
unweary
investors
to
give
money
to
gmic
promising
that
participants
would
receive
double
their
money
back
within
a
year-and-a-half.
in
the
end,
many
investors
received
little
or
no
return
on
their
so-called
investments
to
gmic
while
the
petitioners
received
over
1.2
million
in
commissions
on
the
money
they
solicited.
at
the
close
of
evidence,
petitioners
asked
the
district
court
to
instruct
the
jury
that
the
government
had
to
prove
that
one
of
the
conspirators
had
committed
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
money
laundering
conspiracy.
the
district
court
denied
the
request.
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
petitioners'
convictions
holding
that
the
jury
instruction
approved
by
the
district
court
was
proper
because
proof
of
an
overt
act
is
not
required
under
section
1956(h).
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
that
decision.
we
hold
that
conviction
for
conspiracy
to
commit
money
laundering
under
section
1956(h)
does
not
require
of
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
the
outcome
is
dictated
by
our
decision
over
10
years
ago
in
united
states
versus
shabani
where
we
held
that
the
nearly
identical
language
in
the
drug
conspiracy
statute
does
not
require
proof
of
an
overt
act.
as
we
explained
in
that
case,
the
longstanding
rule
for
conspiracy
statutes
is
that
unless
congress
clearly
says
otherwise,
we
presume
that
it
intends
to
adopt
the
common
law
definition
of
conspiracy.
at
common
law,
conviction
for
conspiracy
did
not
require
proof
of
an
overt
act.
proof
of
the
unlawful
agreement
alone
was
enough.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
