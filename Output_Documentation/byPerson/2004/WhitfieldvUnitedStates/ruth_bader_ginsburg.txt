justice
ruth
bader

but
that
doesn't
respond
to
the
venue
question.
venue,
as
written
in
this
statute
and
in
most
statutes,
is
permissive.
it
gives
you
a
choice
of
forum.
it
doesn't
limit.
in...
in
the
times
when
venue
is
exclusive,
congress
is
explicit
in
telling
you
that,
but
ordinarily
a
venue
provision,
as
this
one,
either/or,
is
permissive.
it
would
be
extraordinary
to
make
a
venue
provision
exclusive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
this
court
has
no
authority
to
make
a
venue
provision
either
exclusive
or
permissive.
congress
decides
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
rule
provision
for
venue,
which
has
not
been
excluded
by
the
statute?
the
ordinary
provision
for
venue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
crime
is
the
conspiracy.
the
overt
act
may
be
an
additional
requirement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
will...
you
will
concede
that
there
are
many
federal
crimes,
conspiracy
crimes,
in
which
an
overt
act
is
not
required.
the
shabani
case
requires
you
to
recognize
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
that
it
doesn't
mean
very
much
because
an
overt
act
wouldn't
be
hard
to
prove.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
are...
i
mean,
the
difference
between
statutes
that
say
overt
act
is
required
and
those
that
just
say
conspiracy...
there
are
many,
many
such
statutes,
and
we
dealt
with
one
in
shabani.
but
of
all
the
statutes
that
include
no
express
overt
act
requirement,
have
any
of
them
be
read
to
implicitly
include
one,
which
is
the
argument
you're
making
that
we
should
adopt
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
would
expect
at
least
a
cross
reference
to
371
for
defining
the
conspiracy,
but
there's
nothing
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
given
a
few
examples
of
a
word
may
mean
different
things
in
different
contexts,
but
you
haven't
given
any
example...
and
i
don't
know
if
there
is
one...
where
the
entire
string
of
words
is
identical
in
two
statutes,
both
dealing
with
conspiracies,
and
you
read
an
overt
act
requirement
into
one
and
not
the
other.
i
mean,
you
have
a
much
harder
argument
to
make
when
you're
talking
about
an
entire
provision
where
the
wording
is
almost
identical
than
when
you're
talking
about
one
word
used
in
different
contexts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
about...
there
are
over
50,
i
think,
in
title
18
alone
conspiracy
provisions
with
no
overt
act
requirement,
no
explicit
overt
act
requirement.
the...
the
argument
you're
making,
i
suppose,
would
require
this
court
to
go
by...
one
by
one
through
those
50-odd
statutes,
and
there
would
be
contests
of
every
one
because
the
absence
of
those
words
is
not
dispositive,
as
you
see
it.
so
you
would
be
generating
a
controversy
about
50-odd
statutes
that
would
be
gone,
that
just
wouldn't
be
there
if
you
agreed
with
justice
souter's
approach.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
you
looked
at
all
59,
i
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
assured
yourself
on
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we've
already
dealt
with
venue
where
i
think
your
argument
is
exceedingly
weak
since
the
statute
phrases
it
as
a
permissive
not
a
requirement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
gave...
it
gave
the
prosecutor
more
choices
of
where
to
bring
suit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i...
i
do
have
one
and
it's
not
on
the
money
laundering
conspiracy
issue,
but
in
this
particular
case,
would
it
be
consistent
with
the
position
that
the
solicitor
general
has
been
taking
for
us
to
hold
the
final
disposition
of
this
case
pending
booker
and
fanfan?
wasn't
there
a
sentencing
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
consistent
with
the
position
that
the
government
has
been
taking
routinely
in
cases
where
booker...
where
the
sentencing
guidelines
are
an
issue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government
has
said
that...
that
you
have
essentially
waived
their
sentencing
guidelines
issue
that
you
asked
us
in
footnote
6
of
your
brief
to
consider.
