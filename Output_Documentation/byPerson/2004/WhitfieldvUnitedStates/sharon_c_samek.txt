ms.
sharon
c.
samek
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
18
u.s.c.
1956(h)
for
the
sole
purpose
of
increasing
the
penalties
for
money
laundering
conspiracies.
congress
did
not
intend
to
abandon
the
overt
act
requirement
from
money
laundering
conspiracies
and
for
good
reason.
the
list
of
specified
unlawful
activities
under
1956
is
vast.
anytime
two
or
more
people
conspire
or
reach
an
agreement
to
commit
a
crime
that
generates
economic
proceeds,
invariably
the
discussion
will
lead
to
what
they're
going
to
do
with
the
money
get...
that
gets
generated,
how
they're
going
to
spend
the
money,
which
is
a
potential
1957
offense,
or
how
they're
going
to
hide
the
money,
a
potential
1956
offense.
the
government
would
charge
these
agreements
as
money
laundering
conspiracies
without
there
even
being
a
single
overt
act
to
demonstrate
that
criminal
intent
had
crystallized,
that
a
money
laundering
conspiracy
was
really
afoot,
and
that
steps
were
being
taken
to
launder
money,
oftentimes
triggering
substantially
higher
penalties
for
the
underlying
offense,
and
subverting...
subverting
the
overt
act
requirement
for
conspiracy
to
commit
the
underlying
offense.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
excuse
me?
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
our
position
is
that
the
venue
provision
in
1956(h)
for
money
laundering
conspiracies
requires
that
they
establish
an
overt
act
and
that
venue
would
lie--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--yes.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
our
position
is
that
the
venue
provision
in
1956,
1956(i),
is
the
exclusive
venue
provision
for
money
laundering.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
section
1956(i)
is
the
venue
provision.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
yes.
our
position
is
that
when
you
read
the
venue--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--certainly,
but
where
the
completed
offense
occurs,
there
certainly
would
be
overt
acts.
you
know,
it's
inherent
in
completing
the
money
laundering
transaction
that
there
would
be
overt
acts
as
part
of
the
financial
transaction.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
i
agree
that
it's...
it's
somewhat
confusing,
your
honor,
but
we
would
submit
that
the
government's
interpretation
of
subclause
(2)
is
that
if
two
people
conspired
in...
if
two
people
in
florida
conspired
to
commit
a
money
laundering
offense
in
california,
absent
any
overt
act
whatsoever,
conspiracy
would
lay
in
california.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
well,
this
court
has
made
venue
provisions
exclusive
in
the
patent
infringement
context
and
in
the
banking
act
precisely
using
the--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--and
our
position
is
that
congress
made
this
venue
provision
the
exclusive
venue
provision--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--our
position
is
that
those
are
the
two
alternatives
for
where
venue
would
lie
for
a
conspiracy
case.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
our
argument
is
that
the
first
clause
of
that
provision
contemplates
the
existence
of
an
overt
act.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
the
ordinary
provision
for
venue
would
be
that
venue
lies
in
the
district
where
the
crime
occurs.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
that
would
be...
in
the
money
laundering
context,
under
our
interpretation
of
1956(h),
that
would
be
where
the
overt
act
occurs.
so
it
would
be
consistent
with
it.
our--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--the
overt
act
is
part
of...
it's
our
position
that
the
overt
act
is
required,
and
there
needs
to
be
an
agreement--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--correct.
and
in
those
cases
where
all
that's
required
is
an
agreement,
then
venue
would
lie
where
the
agreement
occurs,
but
in
this
case,
because
the...
the
offense
requires
an
agreement
plus
an
overt
act,
it's
our
position
that
that's
where
venue
would
lie.
as
a
practical
matter,
if
there
is...
if...
if
this
court
construes
1956(h)
as
requiring
overt
act,
as
a
practical
matter,
anytime
two
people
agree
to
commit
a
money
laundering
conspiracy
in
one
district
and
commit
overt
acts
in
another
district
in
furtherance
of
that,
it
would
be
highly
unlikely
that
there
would
not
be
some
overt
act
in
the
district
where
they
agreed
to
commit
the
offense.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
as
a--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--that's
correct.
and
no.
there...
we
have
not
found
any
cases
where
the
court
has
heretofore
read
an
overt
act
requirement
into
a
conspiracy
provision.
but
this
statute
is
unique.
the
money
laundering
statute
is
unique.
if
you
look
at
the
statute
and
we
lay
it
out...
the
statute
in
total...
in
our
reply
brief,
starting
at
1a...
the
structure
of
1956
strongly
supports
our
position
that
all
congress
was
doing,
when
they
enacted
1956(h),
was
increasing
the
penalty
for
money
laundering
conspiracies.
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
when
congress
typically
writes
a
complex
statute,
the
statute
begins
by
setting
forth
all
of
the
offense
elements.
here,
that
would
be
set
forth
in
(a)(1),
(a)(2),
and
(a)(3).
the
statute
then
goes
on
in
subsection
(b)
to
set
forth
the
civil
penalty
provisions.
subsection
(c)
then
defines
the
various
terms
used
in
the
act.
subsection
(d)
then
talks
about
relationships
with
other
laws.
subsection
(e)
identifies
those
federal
agencies
that
can
investigate
money
laundering
offenses.
subsection
(f)
talks
about
circumstances
under
which
there
would
be
extraterritorial
jurisdiction.
subsection
(g)
then
talks
about
recording...
reporting
requirements,
and
then
you
get
to
subsection
(h),
which
we
say,
when
you
read
the
statute
as
a
whole,
clearly
intends
simply
that
the
penalty
for
money
laundering
conspiracies
would
be
increased
to
the
same
penalties
as
those
prescribed
for
the
offense
provision.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
your
honor--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--it
could
be
construed
as
a
freestanding
offense
provision--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--there
are
not
any
of
the
offense...
conspiracy
provisions
that
this
court
has
interpreted
that
had
the
same
structural
ambiguity
as
1956(h).
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
shabani
is
a
separate,
distinct
statute.
846
was
a
separate,
distinct,
discrete
offense
statute.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
that's
true.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
because
text...
as
this
court
has
said
on
multiple
occasions,
in
order
to
understand
what
the
words
mean
in
a
statute,
you
have
to
look
at
context.
so
you
have
to
look
at
where
the
provision
is
placed
and
what
congress
meant
by
that
provision
and
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole.
if
anyone...
if
we
look--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--you
don't
find
the
overt
act
explicitly
in
the
statute.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
no,
because
our
position
is
that
placing
it
in
subsection
(h)
evidences
that
congress'
intent
and
sole
focus
when
they
enacted
this
was
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
penalty
for
money
laundering.
the--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--it's
our
position
that
they're
incorporating
the
overt
act
requirement,
the
act
in
furtherance
requirement,
from
371
as
evidenced
by
the
legislative
history.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
and
it
would
be
an
offense
under
this
section
because
certainly
the
jury
would
need
to
find
that
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
was
money
laundering.
so
it
would
be
an
offense
in
that
respect.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
i
can
see
how
you
would
read
it
that
way,
your
honor,
but
the
offense--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--the
offense
provisions
set
forth
in
1956
are
clearly
set
out
and
enumerated
in
subsection
(a)(1),
(a)(2),
and
(a)(3).
in
1988...
when
the
statute
was
originally
enacted,
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2)
set
forth
the
offense
provisions.
when
the
statute
was
amended
in
1988
and
congress
intended
to
create
another
offense
provision,
they
set
forth
(a)(1)...
the
third
sting
provision
which
is
(a)(1)(iii).
if
congress
intended
to
create
an
offense
provision
when
they
enacted
1956(h),
they
would
have
set
it
forth
as
(a)(1)(iv),
or
alternatively,
they
would
have
added
or
conspires
to
each
of
the
predecessor
offenses.
notably,
the
offense
provision
at
issue
here
does
not
include
attempts,
which
846
did,
and
which
the
overwhelming
majority
of
conspiracy
subsections
include...
attempts
are
included
with
offenses.
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
include
attempts
in
this
provision
again
reflects
the
fact
that
they
were
solely
focused
on
371,
a
conspiracy
offense,
and
all
they
were
trying
to
do
was
increase
the
penalty.
the
placement
of
the--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--that's
true,
and
it
clearly
would...
it
certainly
would
be
clearer
had
they
done
so.
but
if
you
take
the
language
originally,
this
provision
was
proposed
by
representative
annunzio
to
be
an
amendment
to
371,
and
we
lay
out
in
our...
in
the
blue
brief
at
page
12
what
that
amendment
would
have
looked
like,
virtually
identical
language
to
1956(h).
certainly
if
you
read
it
in
subsection
371...
if
you
take
the
identical
language
and
put
it
in
section
371,
there
wouldn't
be
much
of
an
argument,
we
would
submit,
that
congress
surely
intended
to
include
the
overt
act,
act
in
furtherance
language
and
they
were
just
talking
about
increasing
the
penalty
for
money
laundering.
that
makes
our
point
that
you
look
at
the
language,
and
depending
on
where
it's
placed
in
a
statute,
it
can
have
different
meanings.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
as
this
court
said
in
shabani,
absent
contrary
indications,
the
court
will
presume
that
congress
intends
to
incorporate
the
common
law
concept
of
the
terms
that
it
uses.
in
shabani,
the
defendant
did
not
argue
any
contrary
indications.
they
argued
that
at
common
law
conspiracy
required
the
commission
of
an
overt
act.
that
is
not
our
position.
but
our
position
is
that
here
there
are
contrary
indications,
and
because
the
statute
is
ambiguous
based
on
the
placement
and
structure
of
1956(h),
you
have
to
look
to
see
if
there
are
other
indications.
and
clearly
in
the
legislative
history--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--no,
but
that
is
not
dispositive
because
the
placement
the
congress
has
said...
i
mean,
this
court
has
said
on
multiple
occasions
that
you
need
to
read
a
statute
as
a
whole,
and
when
you
look
at
the--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--i
think
you
can
find
ambiguity,
your
honor.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
in
the--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--reading
the
whole
text
of
the
statute,
it
looks
to
me
it
reads
that
the
offenses
are
set
off...
set
forth
at
the
beginning,
followed
by
the
civil
penalties,
then
procedural
aspects,
including
this
penalty
provision
for
increasing
conspiracies.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
no,
it
doesn't
mention
an
overt
act,
but--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--well,
we
believe
that
1956(h)
clearly
reflects
congress'
intent
to
solely
increase
the
penalty.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
well,
if
congress
inadvertently
omitted
the
overt
act
requirement,
this
court
has
on
prior
occasions
read
into
congressional
silence
terms,
definitions
that
congress
may
have
inadvertently
left
out.
so
in
united
states
v.
taylor,
for
example,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
congress
intended
to
revert
back
to
the
common
law
definition
of
burglary
in
the
career
criminals
amendment
act,
and
in
1984,
the
career
criminals
amendment
act
had
language
that
talked
about
a
generic
burglary,
breaking
and
entering
into
a
dwelling.
in
1986,
when
they
amended
the
act,
they
removed
that
language.
the
question
before
the
court
then
came
up
what
does...
you
know,
what
does
burglary
mean.
congress
had
omitted
those
words,
but
the
court
found
that
that
wasn't
congress'
intent.
they
clearly
didn't
intend
to
revert
back
to
the
common
law,
and
it
was
probably
an
error
of
drafting
and
this
court
found
that
generic
burglary
was
the
standard.
so
this
court
has
done
that
before.
in
the...
in
the
perrin
case,
united
states
v.
perrin,
the
same
thing.
there...
words
were
missing
from
the
statute
and
the
court
did
not
find
that
in
perrin...
it
was
a
bribery
case,
and
what
was
at
issue
was
whether
or
not
the...
the
statute
covered
bribery
of
private
persons
or
only
the
common
law
definition
where
it
would
only
incorporate
bribery
of
public...
public
persons,
public
officials.
and
the
court
said
even
though
there
are
other
statutes
that
have
private
person
language
in
it,
similar
to
this
case,
even
though
there
are
other
statutes
that
have
overt
act
requirements
in
it,
we
are
not
going
to
assume
that
congress
intended
to
revert
back
to
the
common
law
and
interpret
bribery
as
only
applying
to
public
officials.
so
this
court
can
look
at
the
legislative
history.
the
purpose
is
clear.
the
government
admits
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
increase
the
penalty.
prior
to
1956(h),
money
laundering
conspiracies
were
prosecuted
pursuant
to
371,
which
required
the
commission
of
an
overt
act.
congress
clearly
intended
to
increase
the
penalty
from
5
years
to
a
potential
10
or
20
years,
based
on
what
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
was.
the
legislative
history
all
reflects
that
fact,
and
the
government
admits
that.
the...
as
contrasted
with
846,
which...
in
which
the
public
law
described
846
in
a
section
labeled
offenses
and
provision
in
the
money
laundering
context,
the
public
law
described
1956(h)
as
a
penalty
to
increase
the...
as
a
money
laundering
conspiracy
for
increasing
the
penalty.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
point.
i
would
think
that
if
it's
a
conspiracy
to
commit...
if
the
specified
unlawful
activity
is
one
of
the
postal
offenses
or
one
of
the
customs
offenses,
both
of
which
carry--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--it's
our
position
that
when
congress
enacted
this,
they
were
trying
to
enact
a
penalty-enhancing
statute.
1956(h)
then
incorporates
or
impliedly
recognizes
the
overt
act
requirement
from
371.
congress
was
not
intending
to
change
the
way
money
laundering
conspiracies
were
prosecuted.
they
would
have
done
so
under
371,
requiring
the
act
in
furtherance,
and
a
jury
or
a
judge
would
find
that
money
laundering
was
the
object
of
the
conspiracy.
that's
how
congress
envisioned
this
act
as...
as
being
applied,
and
so
i
would
assume
congress
would
envision
that
if
it
was
a
conspiracy
to
violate
one
of
the
postal
offenses,
that
the
postal
authority
would
have
had
authority
to
investigate
that
offense.
interesting--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--i...
i
think
that
would
be
a
sensible
way
to
work
your
way
through
thickets
of
statutes
that
were
enacted
after
shabani
when
this
court
created
that
formulary.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
that's
correct,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
nash
and
singer,
the
cases
that
shabani
relied
on,
were
ever
discussed
or
contemplated
by
congress.
if
congress
was
going
to
make
such
a
fundamental
change
in
how
they
were
going
to
prosecute
money
laundering
conspiracies,
they
would
have
said
so.
we're
not
talking
about
a
backdrop
of
not
requiring
an
overt
act
and
should
congress
read
an
overt
act
into
congress'
silence.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
well,
we
don't...
we
don't
believe
that's
the
case
because
if
you
look
at
all
of
those
subsections
in
title
18,
none
of
them
have
the
structural
ambiguity
that
1956(h)
has,
combined
with
a
venue
provision--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--the--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--i've...
i've
looked
through
the
entire
statute,
and
i
have
not
found...
title
18.
i
have
not
found
any
that
have
both
an
anomaly,
a
structural
anomaly,
and
a
venue
provision
that
turns
on
the
existence
of
an
overt
act.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
well,
first
of
all,
we
would
submit,
just
briefly
on...
on
the
venue
point,
if
congress
wanted
this
to
be
a
permissive
venue
provision,
they
could
have
said
venue
would
lie
where
and
in
the
circumstances
or
as
otherwise
required
by
statute,
in
which
case
they
could
have
shown
that
they
were
applying
to
other
statutory
bases
for
venue,
as
well
as
what
congress
was
establishing
here.
they
didn't
do
that.
the
venue
provision
was
enacted
in
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
cabrales,
which
dealt
with
the
money
laundering...
the
substantive
offense
of
money
laundering,
and
this
court's
suggestion
that
money
laundering
could
be
considered
a
continuing
violation
for
purposes
of
18
u.s.c.
3237,
the
continuing
offense
venue
provision.
if
all
congress
was
doing
was
codifying
that
principle
and
trying
to
address
the
issue
in
cabrales,
they
would
have
just
dealt
with
substantive
money
laundering
in
the
venue
provision.
they
would
not
have
also
included
a
provision
in
the
venue
section
dealing
with
conspiracy.
the
fact
that
they
did
and
the
fact
that
they
used
language
that
this
court
has
previously
found
to--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--we
say
those
are
the
only
choices
on
where
to
bring
suit.
but--
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
--oh,
yes.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
ginsburg,
you
had
inquired
about
the
number
of
subsection...
conspiracy
subsections,
and
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
answer
your
question.
even
if
you
don't
find
the
statute
is
unique
because
of
the
venue
provision,
as
my
review
of
the
conspiracy
subsections
in
title
18,
there
were
only
about
two
others
out
of
the
50-some-odd
cases
that
have
the
same
structural
anomaly
that
1956(h)
does.
so
this
would
not
be
opening
up
a
can
of
worms
to
say
that
in
this
case
an
overt
act
clearly
was
intended
by
congress
and
that
we
need
to
look
at
congressional
intent.
so
it
wouldn't
be...
require...
a
holding
in
this
case
consistent
with
congressional
purpose
would
not
require
the
court
to
then
have
to
review
every
single
title
18
conspiracy
subsection.
as
the
government
pointed
out,
money
laundering
cases
are
not
typically
prosecuted
without
the
commission
of
an
overt
act
because
overt
acts
are
relatively
simple
to
prove.
there's
no
reason
why
congress
would
have
intentionally
eliminated
the
overt
act
requirement
from
money
laundering
conspiracies
when,
on
the
one
hand,
it's
easy
to
prove,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
placed
such
a
critical
value
in
money
laundering
conspiracies
because
it's
not
just
that
it
shows
that
criminal
intent
has
crystallized
and
that
money
laundering
is
actually
afoot,
but
you're
talking
about
taking
offenses,
like
we
say
in
our
brief,
where
someone
pledges
a...
a
cow
for
collateral
for
a
loan
and
then
they
talk
with
a
friend
about
whether
or
not
they
should
sell
the
cow,
and
they
decide
not
to
sell
the
cow.
under
the
government's
theory,
they
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
defrauding
the
government
because,
in
fact,
they
never
sold
the
cow.
they
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
government
because
they
didn't
commit
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
defrauding
the
government.
they
couldn't
be
convicted
or
prosecuted
for
money
laundering
because
they
never
sold
the
cow,
so
there
were
never
any
proceeds
to
generate.
but
they
could
be
convicted,
under
the
government's
theory,
of
conspiracy
to
commit
money
laundering
based
on
the
sale
of
a
cow
and
their
sentence
would
increase
from
a
potential
5
years
to
a
potential
20
years.
there's
absolutely
no
indication
in
the
congressional
record
that
congress
ever
intended
such
dramatic
triggering
of
substantially
higher
penalties
without
the
commission
of
an
overt
act,
which
is
not
difficult
to
prove.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
in
the
district
court,
there
were
issues
raised
as
to
all
defendants
as
far
as
various
sentencing
enhancements.
in
front
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
one
of
those
enhancements
was
argued
and
it
was
rejected.
as
to
mr.
hall,
one
of
the
sentencing
enhancements
were
argued
and
was
reversed
on
that
sentencing
enhancement.
but
there
is
still
a
sentencing
enhancement
that
was
raised
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
but
it
was
not
raised
in
this
petition.
it
was
not
the
issue
that
this
court
granted
cert
on,
but
we
would
argue
that
it's
still
a
valid...
a
valid
claim
and
that
this
court
should
hold
this
decision
in
abeyance
until
its
decision
in
booker
and
fanfan.
ms.
sharon
c.
samek
the
argument
was
that
the
facts
didn't
support
it.
finally,
your
honor,
we
would...
your
honors,
we
would
just
again
say
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
cause
a
dramatic
change
in
the
way
money
laundering
conspiracies
were
prosecuted.
this
court
has
said
in
other
cases
that
when
congress
intends
dramatic
changes,
that
you
would
expect
to
find
something
in
the
legislative
history.
the
court
has
said
that
in
the
lewis
case
having
to
do
with
interstate
gambling
and...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
