justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
only
basis
for
venue?
i
mean,
i
thought
the
statute
provides
that's
just
one
of
the
bases
for
venue.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
read
it.
what
does
it
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
mean,
one
can
understand
that
if
the
venue
provision
just
read,
a
prosecution
may
be
brought
in
any...
in...
let's
see...
may
be
brought
in
the
district
where
venue
would
lie
for
the
completed...
if
it
just
read,
venue
will
lie
in
any
district
where
an
act
in
furtherance
of
the
attempt
or
conspiracy
took
place,
then
we
could
argue
about
whether
that
is
the
exclusive
venue
or
not.
but
i
don't
see
how
there
is
even
an
argument
that
it's
the
exclusive
venue
when
you're
dealing
with
a
provision
which
says
that
a
prosecution
may
be
brought
in
the
district
where
the...
where
venue
would
lie
for
the
completed
offense
or
in
any
other
district
where
an
act
in
furtherance
took
place.
how
can
you
possibly
read
that
to
say
that
the
exclusive
venue
is
a
place
where
an
act
in
furtherance
took
place?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay,
but...
but
then...
then
you
acknowledge
that
the
place
where
an
overt
act
took
place
is
not
the
exclusive
venue.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
there
are
other
statutes
that...
that
read
this
way,
which
we
have
held
to...
to
create
the
conspiracy
offense,
as
well
as
impose
the
penalty
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it...
it
could
do
that.
any
person
who
conspires
to
commit
any
offense
defined
in
this
section
shall
be
subject
to
the
same
penalties
as
those
prescribed
for
the
offense.
and
that
could
be
deemed
to
create
the
conspiracy
offense
and
prescribe
the
penalty
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
are
other
such
provisions,
aren't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
get--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
that's
so...
if
that's
so,
then
why
does
the
venue
provision
which
you
were
just
alluding
to
earlier
read,
except
as
provided
in
paragraph
(2),
a
prosecution
for
an
offense
under
this
section.
an
offense
under
this
section
or
section
1957
may
be
brought
in...
and
then
it
says...
(2)
a
prosecution
for
an
attempt
or
a
conspiracy
offense
under
this
section.
not
under
section
371,
but
a
prosecution
for
an
attempt
or
a
conspiracy
offense
under
this
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
think
that
language
really
cuts
very
hard
against
you.
a
conspiracy
offense
under
this
section.
it...
it
is
reading
as
though
that's
the
section
that
defines
the
offense,
not
just
the
section
that
provides
the
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
because
i'm
a
reasonable
man.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i...
can
i
ask
what
you
make
of
subsection
(d)
of...
of
this
provision
which
says
that
violations
of
this
section
may
be
investigated
by
such
components
of
the
department
of
justice
as
the
attorney
general
may
direct
and
by
such
components
of
the
department
of
the
treasury
as
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
may
direct,
as
appropriate,
and
with
respect
to
offenses
over
which
the
postal
service
has
jurisdiction,
by
the
postal
service?
apparently
there
was
some
turf
war
going
on
as
to
who
had
jurisdiction
over
these
offenses
and...
and
this
was
meant
to...
to
solve
the
turf
war,
but
it
reads
violations
of
this
section.
now,
does
that
allocation
of
authority
among
justice
and
treasury
and
the
postal
service
not
apply
to
the
conspiracy
offenses
under
section
371?
because
that's
not
a
violation
of
this
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
offense
is
never
completed.
there's
nothing...
nothing
occurs
except
a
conspiracy,
and
you're
telling
us
a
conspiracy
is
not
a
violation
of
this
section.
this
section
sets
forth
the
penalty...
that's
your
argument...
but
it
does
not
establish
the
offense.
the
offense
is
established
by
371.
if
that's
the
case,
this
allocation
of
responsibility
among
the
various
divisions
of
the
government
doesn't
apply
to
conspiracy
prosecutions,
which
would
make
no
sense
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
when...
when
you
say
when
there
are
multiple
objects,
you're
not
getting
the
money...
money
laundering
just
under
371.
you'd
surely
charge
both
under
371
and
under...
under...
what
is
it?
1956.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
846.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
argument
below
that...
#
that
imposing
the
sentencing
enhancement
was
unconstitutional,
or
was
the
argument
just
that
the
facts
didn't
support
it?
