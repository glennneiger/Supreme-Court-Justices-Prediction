what
do
you...
excuse
me.
what...
what
do
you
make
of...
of
this
argument?
let's
start
with
the
premise
that
congress
wasn't
thinking
about
overt
acts
at
all.
start
with
the
premise
that
you
argue
from
that
what
congress
was
concerned
with
here
was
primarily
penalty.
however,
congress
did
this
in
a
context
in
which
there
are
two
recognized
kinds
of
statutes,
two
recognized
kinds
of...
of
conspiracy
formulations.
and
if
one
has
the
magic
words
in
it
referring
to
an
overt
act,
you
got
to
prove
an
overt
act.
in
the
other
variety,
there's
no
reference
to
overt
acts,
and
as
a
general
rule,
you
don't
have
to
prove
overt
acts.
why
isn't
it
a
sensible
interpretive
rule
to
say,
look,
when
there
are
recognized
models
and
congress,
in
fact,
chooses
one
rather
than
another,
we're
not
going
to
get
into
the
question
of
did
congress
really
mean
to
make
a
change
when
it
picked
one
model
rather
than
the
other?
it
simply
picked
one
model,
and
the...
the
clearest
way
to
have
a
coherent
system
of
conspiracy
law
is
to
apply
the
model.
if
it
didn't
talk
about
overt
act,
there's
no
overt
act
requirement.
why
isn't
that
a
sensible
way
to...
to
work
our
way
through
these
thickets?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
shabani
rested
on...
on
the
existence
of
these
prior
models.
shabani
didn't
create
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
if...
if
371
were
repealed,
would
it
affect
the
actual
practice
in
the
justice
department?
i...
i
think
i
recall
reading
in
the
briefs
for
the
other
side
that...
that
the...
the
united
states
has
continued
to
charge
conspiracies
in
money
laundering
cases
under
371.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
in
exclusively
laundering
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
make
of
the...
the
argument
that
i
think
occurs
in
the
yellow
brief,
that...
the
reference
to
any
other
district
where
an
act
in
furtherance,
et
cetera,
took
place
implies
that
in
the
clause
preceding,
they
were
referring
to
a
district
in
which
an
act
in
furtherance
took
place?
