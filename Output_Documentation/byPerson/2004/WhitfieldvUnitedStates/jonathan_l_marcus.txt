mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
money
laundering
conspiracy
statute
does
not
require
proof
of
an
overt
act
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
text
of
the
statute
contains
no
such
requirement.
second,
the
statute
is
modeled
on
the
drug
conspiracy
statute
which
this
court
unanimously
held
in
the
shabani
case
does
not
require
proof
of
an
overt
act.
third,
the
statute
was
enacted
against
the
background
rule
of
statutory
construction
that...
that
a
conspiracy
provision,
whose
text
conditions
liability
on
the
act
of
conspiring
only,
will
be
construed
to
follow
the
common
law,
where
proof
of
an
overt
act
was
not
required
for
conviction.
this
court
should
adhere
to
its
bright
line
rule
in
this
case
because
it
provides
clear
guidance
to
congress
and
to
the
lower
courts.
petitioners
seek
to
avoid
application
of
the
bright
line
rule
on
a
variety
of
grounds,
none
of
which
has...
none
of
which
has
merit.
i
will
address
a
few
of
those
grounds
here.
first,
the
money
laundering
conspiracy
statute,
section
1956(h),
is
not
a
penalty
provision
for
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
section
371.
section
1956(h)
does
not
contain
any
reference
to
section
371,
and
petitioners
are
unable
to
cite
any
provision
in
the
united
states
code
that
provides
a
penalty
for
an
offense
defined
elsewhere,
without
also
referencing
where
that
offense
is
defined.
under
petitioners'
theory,
if
section
371
were
appealed
tomorrow,
section
1956(h)
would
also
no
longer
be
valid.
but
there
is--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
my
understanding
is
on...
on
occasion
that
is
done
in
a
multi-object
conspiracy
case.
where
there
are
several
objects
to
the
conspiracy
sometimes
for
purpose
of
simplification,
the
government
will
just...
will
charge
a
371--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--generally,
no.
there
might
be...
there
might
be
an
occasional
example
where
it
may
have
been
an
oversight
where
a
prosecutor
may
have
overlooked
section
1956(h),
maybe
soon
after
1956(h)
was
enacted,
but
generally
speaking
no.
the
money
laundering
conspiracy
prosecutions
are
done
under
1956(h).
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
you
could.
you
could
prosecute...
you
could
prosecute
them
as...
as
separate
offenses,
but
sometimes
the
government
for...
just
for
purpose
of
simplification
will
just
charge
one...
one
agreement
with
multiple
objects,
and
one
of
those
objects
might
be
a
money
laundering
object.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
yes,
you
could
charge
under
371.
there's
nothing
that
prevents
the
government
from
doing
so.
this
court
has...
has
held
before,
for
example,
in
the
batchelder
case
that
there
can
be
multiple
provisions
that
essentially
cover
the
same
conduct,
and
the
government
has
discretion
to
choose
which
one
to
use.
generally
speaking,
the
money
laundering
conspiracy
statute
contains
higher
penalties.
so
the
practice
today
is...
is
to
prosecute
those
offenses
under
section
1956(h).
another...
another
reading
there...
another
reason
they're
reading
that
it's
a
penalty
provision
should
be
rejected
is
that
congress
modeled
section
1956(h)
on
the
drug
conspiracy
statute
that's
virtually
identically
worded
to
section
1956(h),
and
no
one
disputes
that
the
drug
conspiracy
statute
establishes
a
freestanding
criminal
offense.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
846,
yes,
in
title
21.
petitioners
also
argue
that
because
prior
to
enactment
of
section
1956(h),
the
government
had
to
prosecute
money
laundering
conspiracies
for
6
years
under
section
371,
that
this
court
should
presume
that
congress
intended
to
perpetuate
the
overt
act
requirement
of
section
371
into
the
money
laundering
conspiracy
offense.
but
this
court
looks,
first,
to
the
text
of
the
statute
to
discern
congress'
intent,
and
had
congress
wanted
to
perpetuate
section
371's
overt
act
requirement,
it
could
have
easily
modeled
the
text
of
section
1956(h)
on
the
language
from
371
or
on
the
language
from
any
of
the
other
numerous
conspiracy
provisions
in
the
code
that
contained
express
overt
act
requirements.
congress
chose
a
different
model,
the
drug
conspiracy
statute,
which
as
i
said
before,
this
court
held
in
shabani
does
not
contain
an
overt
act
requirement.
by
choosing
that
model,
congress
manifested
its
intent
not
to
require
proof
of
an
overt
act
because
at
the
time
it...
because
at
the
time
it
acted,
the
background
rule
of
statutory
construction
provided
that
a
conspiracy
statute
that
conditions
liability
solely
on
the
act
of
conspiring
would
be
construed
to
follow
the
common
law.
petitioners
point
to
silence
in
the
legislative
history,
but
the
silence
in
the
legislative
history
on
the
overt
act
requirement
is
not
the
kind
of
compelling
evidence
of...
of
contrary
intent
that
would
justify
departing
from
the
text
of
the
statute
and
this
court's
bright
line
rule.
finally,
petitioners
rely
on
a
venue
provision
for
money
laundering
cases,
section
1956(i),
which
was
enacted
9
years
after
the
money
laundering
conspiracy
statute
at
issue
here.
that
venue
provision
reflects
congress'
intent
to
identify
a
variety
of
districts
in
which
money
laundering
cases
can
be
brought.
it
does
not
reflect
an
intent
to
redefine
the...
the
elements
of
the
substantive
money
laundering
conspiracy
offense.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
justice
souter,
i
think
what...
what
that
terminology
was...
was
referring
to
was
district.
the
other
is
meant
to
modify
district.
in
other
words,
the
first...
the
first
clause
there
provides
a
venue
where
the
case
can
be
brought.
and
if
it's
not
brought
in
that...
if
it
doesn't
fall
within
that
venue,
then
you
can
bring
it
in...
in
a
different
district,
an
other
district.
i
think
that's
the...
the
best
way
to
read
the...
the
statute.
i
mean,
otherwise,
it
could
have...
as
it
was
pointed
out
during
petitioners'
argument,
otherwise
they
could
have
just
had
one.
they
wouldn't
need
separate
clauses.
they
could
have
just
had
one
clause
that
said,
and
the
case...
the
conspiracy
case
can
be
brought
in
any
district
where
an
overt
act
was
committed.
petitioners
seize
on
the
fact
that
the
venue
provision
permits
venue
to
be
laid
in
any
district
in
which
an
overt
act
was
committed.
but
the
rule
in
conspiracy
cases
has
always
been
that
an
overt...
that
venue
can
be
laid
where
an
overt
act
was
committed
regardless
of
whether
an
overt
act
was
an
element
of
the
offense.
at
common
law,
as
i
said
before,
conspiracies...
a
conspiracy
conviction
did
not
rely...
depend
on
proof
of
an
overt
act,
and
yet
venue
could
always
be
laid
at
common
law
where
an
overt
act
was
committed.
the
common
law
venue
rule
has
been
applied
consistently
to
modern
federal
conspiracy
statutes,
such
as
the
drug
conspiracy
statute,
which
likewise
does
not
require
proof
of
an
overt
act
as
an
element
of
the
offense.
congress'
codification
in
the
money
laundering
statute
of...
of
this...
of
this
venue
principle
cannot
be
read
to
presuppose
an
overt
act
element
when
the
very
venue
rule
it
was
codifying
did
not
presuppose
one.
if
this
court...
if
this
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--i'm...
i'm
not
aware
of...
i'm
not
aware
of
a
number,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
i...
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
it's--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--yes.
i
think
it's
true
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
the
government
does
have
proof
of
an
overt
act.
and,
of
course,
overt
acts
help
establish
the...
establish
the
agreement
and...
and
to
convince
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
there
was
an
agreement.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
--well,
it's
our
position
that
it
wasn't...
they
didn't
raise
that
issue
in...
in
the
court
of
appeals.
they
didn't
raise
the
sixth
amendment
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals.
they
didn't
raise
that
issue
in
their
cert
petition
here,
and
so
it's...
it's
not
covered
by
the...
by
the
question
presented.
so
it
is
the
position
that
we've...
that
we've
set
out
in
the
brief
that
it
should
not
be...
it
should
not
be
held
pending
that...
that
disposition
in
booker
and
fanfan.
mr.
jonathan
l.
marcus
well,
i
think
in
the...
i
think
that
that
position
is
based
on
petitions
that
have
raised
the
question,
i
believe.
if...
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
it
should
reaffirm
the
conspiracy
statutes
that
do
not
contain
an
overt
act
requirement
should
not
be
read
to
include
one.
thank
you.
