we'll
now
hear
argument
in
whitfield
against
the
united
states
and
hall
against
the
united
states.
ms.
samek.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
just
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
do
they
have
to
prove
an
overt
act
in
order
to
establish
venue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
government
have
to
prove
an
overt
act
in
order
to
establish
venue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your...
you
say
the...
the
statute
requires.
i'm
just
asking
if
it
independently
of
the
conspiracy
statute...
of
the...
the
substantive
statute
itself,
how
do
they
establish
venue.
do
they
have
to
prove
an
overt
act
just
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
venue
established--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
they
do--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
why
would
they
state
it
in
the
alternative
if...
why
would
they
state
it
in
the
alternative
if
the
overt
act
were
always
required?
that's
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
course,
if
you
look
at
this
statute
as
a
whole,
you
don't
find
the
overt
act
requirement
in
it
anywhere,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
fact
that
you
described
it
as
a
long,
detailed
statute
it
seems
to
me
cuts
against
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
were
making
it
unnecessary
to
rely
on
the
general
conspiracy
statute
in
18-371
or
whatever
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
statute
that's
ambiguous,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
read
it
as
a
whole,
you
can't
find
any
ambiguity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
text
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
reading
the
whole
text.
justice
john
paul
stevens
none
of
which
mentions
an
overt
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
don't
find
anything
ambiguous
in
what
you
describe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
that's
all
they
thought
of,
but
maybe
they
did
a
little
more
than
they
thought
they
were
doing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
want
to
reserve
any
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
marcus.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
had
just
one
other
question,
just
out
of
curiosity,
about
how
important
this
case
is.
how
many
prosecutions
under
this
statute
does
the
government
bring
without
proving
an
overt
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
quite
unlikely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering.
it
seems
to
me
sort
of
a
tempest
in
a
teapot,
this
whole
case
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
marcus.
ms.
samek,
you
have
about
3
and
a
half
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you
very
much.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
stevens
justice
oâ€™connor
has
an
opinion
to
announce.
