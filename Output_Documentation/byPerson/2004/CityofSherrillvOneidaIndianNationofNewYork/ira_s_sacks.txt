mr.
ira
s.
sacks
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
the
court's
permission,
the
state
of
new
york,
as
amicus,
will
address
issues
related
to
the
treaty
of
buffalo
creek
and
i
will
address
the
other
reasons
why
aboriginal
title
and
other
indian
possessory
rights
to
the
properties
at
issue
were
extinguished
long
before
the
oneida
indian
nation
purchased
the
properties
in
1997
and
1998.
the
asserted
basis
for
tax
immunity
in
this
case
appears
at
page
1
of
respondent's
brief
which
is
that
the
oneidas
have
at
all
times
held
a
tribal
possessory
right
in
the
properties.
but
even
if
there
was
a
tribal
possessory
right,
aboriginal
title
or
under
the
treaty
of
canandaigua,
in
1805
and
1807
when
these
properties
passed
out
of
tribal
hands,
the
passage
of
190
years
has
extinguished
that
right.
for
190
years,
these
properties
have
been
in
private
non
indian
hands,
have
been
freely
alienable,
have
been
transferred
to
numerable
purchasers
and
have
been
subject
to
a
full
panoply
of
state
and
local
laws
including
taxation.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
no.
it
is
not
our
position
that
that
would
be
a
valid
transfer
if
there
was
a
violation
of
the
nonintercourse
act.
the
principal
issue
here
is
whether,
after
of
the
passage
of
190
years,
there
remains
a
possessory
right.
if
there
was
a
violation
of
a
nonintercourse
act
in
1805
and
1807,
justice
kennedy,
we
believe
the
oneida
indian
nation
has
a...
under
this
court's
decision
has
a
federal
common
law
damage
suit
against
new
york
state
or
against
the
united
states
of
america
for
failing
to
exercise
its
fiduciary
duty.
but
after
190
years,
in
1997,
they
did
not
have
a
possessory
right
to
these
properties.
the
possessory
right
we're
talking
about,
aboriginal
title
or
some
other
tribal
possessory
right,
isn't
just
the
concept.
as
this
court
has
defined
aboriginal
title
of
those
possessory
rights,
it's
a
right
to
current
possession.
and
under
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
such
as
felix
versus
patrick
and
yankton
sioux
and
williams
and
mitchell
and
santa
fe,
all
of
which
were
cited
in
the
dissent
written
by
justice
stevens,
though
there
was
a
dissent
in
oneida
ii,
tribal
possessory
rights
are
barred
by
that
passage
of
time,
the
change
in
the
character
of
the
land
and
the
innumerable
innocent
purchasers.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
the
basis
for
the
tax
immunity
here
is
that
this
land
does
not
have
indian
country
status.
for
this
land
to
have
indian
country
status,
it
has
to
be,
in
our
view,
under
this
court,
the
venetie
decision.
federal
set
asides
and
federal
superintendents.
if
you
look
at
how
the
oneida
indian
nation
got
this
land
in
1997,
it
wasn't
because
of
any
set
aside
by
the
federal
government
in
1794
even
if
there
was
and
i
will
get
you
that
later.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
i
absolutely
agree
with
you.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
but
your
hypothetical,
your
honor,
presupposed
the
existence
of
the
reservation
and
presupposed
a
possessory
right
subject
to
lease.
the
possessory
right
here
did
not
exist
because
the
oneida
indian
nation
had
no
rights
with
respect
to
the
land
at
all
in
1997.
those
rights
could
not
be
enforced.
the
right
not
to
be--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
definition
of
indian
country.
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
indian
country,
it
requires,
with
respect
to
the
properties
we're
talking
about,
federal
set
asides
and
federal
superintendents.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
if
i
understand
the
question
that
you
asked,
your
honor,
if
the
title
came
from
the
state
of
new
york,
for
example--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--no,
your
honor.
in
a
situation
where
there
was
continuing
aboriginal
title,
similar
to
the
senecas
in
the
state
of
new
york
where
new
york
did
not
terminate
the
aboriginal
rights
of
the
senecas,
there
need
not
be
congressional
act,
there
need
not
be
congressional
or
treaty
action
to
establish
the
reservation.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
what
extinguished
the
aboriginal
title
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
the
argument,
and
then
i
will
move
on
to
the
treaty
of
fort
schuyler
and
the
treaty
of
canandaigua.
what
extinguished
the
aboriginal
title
is
the
passage
of
time,
the
fact
that
this
land
has
been
under
state
and
local
jurisdiction
for
190
years
and
this
court
observed,
in
hagen
and
rosebud
sioux,
i
acknowledge
it
was
in
a
different
context
but
this
is
important,
that
state
and
local
jurisdiction
sovereignty
are
important
in
situations
like
this
where
what
we're
dealing
with
is
very
few...
1
percent
of
the
land
in
the
city
of
sherrill
is
owned
by
the
tribe.
the
land
is
predominantly
non
indian.
and
as
this
court
observed
in
hagen
and
rosebud
sioux,
a
finding
of
the
land
now
comes
back
into
tribal
jurisdiction,
to
paraphrase,
seriously
disrupts
the
justifiable
expectations
of
the
community
and
that's
not
just
a
hypothetical
in
this
case.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
i
think
what
this
appears,
your
honor,
is
the
right
to
possess.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
what
impacts
the
expectations
is
the
following.
i'll
give
you
an
example
that
appears
from
the
joint
appendix
on
the
court
of
appeals
on
pages
1263
to
1277.
in
the
year
2000,
the
city
of
oneida
decided
two
oneida
nation
businesses,
a
convenience
store
and
a
gas
station,
for
16
fire
code
violations.
the
tribe
citing
this
court's
decision
in
brendale
said,
we're
not
governed
by
the
local
fire
code.
we're
governed
by
tribal
jurisdiction.
it's
more
than
just
the
interference,
the
issue
of
taxation,
the
issue
of
sovereignty
is
whether
a
gas
station
is
going
to
blow
up
or
burn
down.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
i
think
in
terms
of
the
problems
for
the
citizens
of
the
city
of
sherrill,
taxation
is
part
of
it,
and
sovereignty
is
part
of
it,
they
go
hand
in
hand.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
yes,
you
do,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
the
position
we're
taking
here
is
fully
consistent
with
oneida
ii.
in
oneida
ii,
this
court
held
that
there
was
a
violation
of
federal
common
law
principally
because
of
a
violation
of
the
nonintercourse
indian
trade
intercourse
act
in
1795.
this
court
wasn't
asked
to
deal
with,
at
that
time,
with
the
treaty
of
fort
schuyler.
it
wasn't
asked
to
deal
with
the
treaty
of
buffalo
creek.
it
wasn't
presented
with
evidence
of
the
numerous
authorized
new
york
state
treatise
from
1840
through
1846
that
the
ministries
reservation
of
the
state
of
new
york
will
deal
with--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
principle
of
stare
decisis
still
govern
and
i
think
why
this
is
consistent
with
the
position
that
we
have
taken
with
respect
to
the
passage
of
time
extinguishing
the
possessory
right
is
what
this
court
for
stare
decisis
purposes
found
in
oneida
ii
was
that
there
was
a
violation
of
federal
common
law
with
respect
to
a
transfer
that
was
very
different
than
this
transfer.
without
any
examination
of
the
treaty
of
buffalo
creek
or
without
any
examination
of
the
treaty
of
fort
schuyler.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
your
honor,
that
might
or
might
not
be
correct,
depending
on
how
one
used
the
scope
of
the
nonintercourse
act.
but
if
one
views
the
scope
of
the
nonintercourse
act
to
apply
to
indian
reservations,
even
state
reservations,
as
the
second
circuit
in
mohican
tribe
has
held,
then
the
treaty
of
fort
schuyler
could
have
terminated
all
aboriginal
title.
the
treaty
of
fort
schuyler
could
have
established
a
state
reservation
for
the
oneidas,
and
the
nonintercourse
act
of
1790,
two
years
later,
could
have
prohibited
the
sale
of
those
lands
even
though
it
was
a
state
reservation
and
under
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
well,
this
court
has
not
dealt
with
that
issue
and
for
our
purposes.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
the
nonintercourse
act
in
effect
at
the
time
prohibited
the
purchase
of
lands
from
indians
or
indian
tribes,
to
paraphrase.
and
what
hasn't--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--yes,
unless
subject
to
federal
approval.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
the
city
of
sherrill
is
not
a
party
in
the
land
claim
litigation.
the
land
claim
litigation--
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
--what
we
are
talking
about...
to
answer
the
first
portion
of
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
ultimately
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
new
york
would
pay
but
the
judgement
would
be
against
either
the
state
of
new
york
or
the
against
the
counties
in
the
land
plat.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
the
town
can't
regulate
it
and
if
they
are
running
a
business
on
it,
we
believe
this
is
contrary
to
state
law,
they
are
running
a
business
out
there,
they
are
not
collecting
sales
taxes.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
the
tribe
has
changed
its
position
on
that,
i
believe,
in
the
course
of
the
last
30
years
but
that
is
their
current
position.
that
it
becomes
subject
to
the
nonintercourse
act
consistent
with
their
position.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
want
to
turn
to
the
1788
treaty
of
fort
schuyler
and
the
complementing
the
1794
treaty
of
canandiagua.
our
position
on
the
treaty
of
fort
schuyler
i
think
is
very
plain
in
our
papers
and
i
just
want
to
highlight
what's
in
the
rest
of
the
treaty
after
article
1,
which
is
a
cessionable
land.
but
in
the
rest
of
the
treaty
is
that
new
york
reserved
numerous
rights
even
with
respect
to
the
reservation's
land.
new
york
had,
among
other
things,
the
right
to
make
and
apply
laws
to
the
reservation,
to
enforce
the
treaty...
and
i'm
quoting
from
article
4...
in
such
manner
as
the
state
shall
deem
proper.
new
york
had
the
right
to
enforce
its
criminal
laws
with
respect
to
intruders
on
the
reservation
that
new
york
granted
to
the
oneidas
obtaining
the
assistance
of
the
oneidas
to
do
so.
new
york,
in
the
treaty,
prohibited
the
oneidas
from
selling
lands.
new
york,
in
the
treaty,
prohibited
the
oneidas
from
certain
length
of
leases
and
new
york
had
the
right
to
enact
laws
with
respect
to
the
leases
that
were
permitted
to
enforce
the
leases.
the
other
thing
that
one
needs
to
look
at
in
the
context
of
the
times,
we're
looking
at
how
would
the
oneidas
have
understood
this.
the
tribes
of
the
iroquois
confederacy,
knew
how
to
preserve
their
aboriginal
title
when
they
wanted
to
do
so
and
the
oneidas
didn't
do
that.
in
the
1797
big
tree
agreement
with
the
senecas
which
is
published
at
7
statutes
at
large,
601,
the
senecas
sold
much
of
their
lands
throughout
the
marsh
under
the
approval
of
the
united
states.
in
the
agreement,
the
agreement
provided
that
the
reserved
lands
were,
and
i
quote,
clearly
and
fully
understood
to
remain
the
property
of
the
senecas
in
as
full
and
ample
matter
as
if
these
presence
had
not
been
executed.
that
is
the
way
an
indian
tribe
understood
preserving
aboriginal
title.
that
didn't
happen
in
the
treaty
of
fort
schuyler.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
i'm
sure
it
was
not,
your
honor.
the
other
thing
that
one
has
to
look
at
at
times
is
what
new
york
state
was
doing.
new
york
state
entered
into
three
similar
treatise
at
the
time.
one
with
the
oneidas,
one
with
the
cayuga
and
one
with
the
onondaga.
those
three
treaties
all
terminated
aboriginal
title
in
the
first
provision.
the
other
three
tribes
of
the
were
not
of
concern.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
yes,
they
had
the
exact
same
language
in
article
1.
the
structure
of
the
treaties
were
identical.
the
other
three
tribes
of
the
iroquois
were
not
of
concern
to
new
york
state
in
1788
because
the
mohawks
had
mostly
moved
to
canada,
the
tuscaroras
had
no
land
of
their
own
and
the
senecas
were
in
the
portion
of
new
york
state
where
massachusetts
had
the
preemption
right.
so
if
you
look
at
what
is
happening
back
in
1788
and
early
1789,
new
york
state
is
setting
up
a
state
treaty
with
the
oneidas
and
keeping
jurisdiction
over
those
lands.
now,
to
go
back
to
what
you
asked
earlier,
there
is
no
question
that
if
in
that
context,
the
federal
government
then
passed
a
statute
that
says,
as
it
may,
the
oneidas
can't
sell
this
land
without
federal
approval.
that's
a
violation
of
the
nonintercourse
act
but
it
doesn't
change
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
land
as
being
under
state
jurisdiction
and
has
been
under
state
jurisdiction
since
1788.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
if
you
count
an
agent
going
on
the
land,
there
was
an
agent
going
on
the
land,
but
what
happened
with
this
land
in
terms
of
federal
superintendents
is
that
this
land
has
been
superintended,
and
supervised
whether
in
tribal
hands
or
otherwise
by
the
state
of
new
york
and
local
governments
since
1788.
there
is
a
reference
in
our
papers
to
a
report,
what
was
issued
in
connection
with
the
new
york
state
setting
up
their
troopers
to
cover
the
reservations
and
that
reported
knowledge
that
the
united
states
government
appreciated
the
fact
that
the
state
of
new
york
had
been
keeping
peace
on
the
reservations
with
their
police
and
so
no
reason
to
interfere
with
100
years...
and
this
was
in
the
20th
century...
of
over
100
years
of
state
police
supervision.
mr.
ira
s.
sacks
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
fbi
doesn't
do
it,
states
often
do
it.
they
do
it
sometimes
with
the
permission
but
this
happened
for
200
years.
