ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
justice
stevens,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
new
york
was
granted
time
to
address
the
third
question
regarding
the
1838
treaty
which
we
believe
requires
reversal
of
the
decision
below
because
it
disestablish
the
oneida
reservation.
respondents
claim
that
there
is
not
exercised
sovereignty
over
any
part
of
land
they
buy
within
a
vast
300,000
tract
in
central
new
york.
this
has
long
been
inhabited--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--i
believe
that
it
is,
your
honor,
for
the
reasons
that
are
laid
out
in
petitioner's
brief
but
regardless
of
what
the
court
decides
about
that
question,
the
treaty
of
1838
clearly
disestablishes
the
reservation
which
terminates
all
sovereignty
prospectively.
the
language
in
the
historical
context...
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
the
treaty
of
buffalo
creek.
it
makes
clear
both
the
language
of
the
treaty
itself
as
well
as
its
historical
context
that
it
was
intended
to
terminate
into
the
sovereignty
of
new
york
state.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
no,
your
honor,
ratification
is
not
presented
squarely
in
this
case.
the
only
question
that's
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not,
regardless
of
whether
the
transactions
that
took
place
between
1795
and
1838
were
legal
or
illegal,
and
we've
argued
they're
legal
in
other
cases--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--well,
at
that
point--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--with
regard
to
the
5,000
acres
that
they
occupied
as
of
1838,
one
could
read
ransom
gillet's
assurances
to
the
oneidas
as
allowing
them
to
continue
to
retain
occupancy
over
that
narrow
place
of
land
but
what
that
cannot
do
is
change
the
language
of
the
treaty
which
makes
clear
that
the
reservation
is
otherwise
entirely
disestablished.
and
if
i
can
refer
to
some
of
the
language
of
the
treaty
itself,
first
of
all,
the
treaty
explicitly
states
that
its
purpose
was
to
carry
out
the
governor's
policy
in
removing
the
indians
from
the
east
to
the
west
of
the
mississippi.
that
simply
cannot
be
squared
with
ongoing
sovereignty
over
the
remaining
290,000
acres
which
they
now
claim.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
this
court
held
that
article
13
of
the
treaty
which
provides
that
the
oneidas
agreed
to
remove
was
sufficient
to
effect
the
present
grant
of
the
kansas
land
and
to
avoid
any
forfeiture.
so
it
was
much
more
than
an
agreement
to
agree
or
an
offer,
if
you
will.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
no,
they
did
receive
consideration
and
the
court
made
sure--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--who
gave
none,
your
honor?
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
no,
your
honor.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
then
in
that
case,
i
suppose
i
should
agree.
my
apologies.
but
what
they
did
was
to
agree
to
remove
and
in
fact,
that's
what
happened.
if
you
look
at
what
transpired
immediately
following
the
treaty,
by
1846,
all
but
350
acres,
down
from
5,000,
have
been
sold
by
the
oneidas
and
very
few
remain.
by
1920,
there
are
only
32
acres.
and
the
u.s.
's
activities
in
the
area
also
confirm
that
that
was
the
understanding
of
the
treaty,
that
it
terminated
sovereignty.
there
have
been
very
sparse
references
in
the
records
to
some
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
u.s.
starting
around
the
turn
of
the
century,
around
the
early
1900s,
but
those
only
relate
to
the
32
acres
that
remain
occupied
by
the
oneidas.
there
is
no
indication
of
any
exercise
of
u.s.
jurisdiction
over
the
remaining
295,000
acres.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i
believe
the
text
and
the
historical
background
suggests
otherwise,
your
honor.
article
4
of
the
treaty
says
that
the
kansas
lands
will
be
the
new
homes
of
the
oneidas
and
it
also
explains
where
the
oneidas
can
exercise
sovereignty.
it
says
that
it
will
secure
to
the
oneidas
in
the
kansas
land
in
said
country,
which
refers
to
the
kansas
land,
the
right
to
establish
their
own
form
of
government,
to
appoint
their
own
offices
and
to
administer
their
own
laws.
that
means
that
sovereignty
is
to
be
in
kansas,
not
to
be
in
new
york.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
that
related
only
to
the
5,000
acres
that
they
occupied
at
that
time.
but
let's
make
very
clear
about
he
made
that
assurance.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't.
the
treaty
on
its
terms
appears
to
disestablish
the
reservation
entirely.
direct
statements
could
perhaps
be
read
as
subsequent
blocks
on
that
treaty
to
assure
the
indians
that
they
won't
be
forced
off
their
land,
the
5,000
acres
that
they
continue
to
occupy,
perhaps
because
new
york
was
not
a
party
to
the
treaty,
it
couldn't
be
any
explicit
session
language
in
the
treaty.
new
york
was
the
only
entity
that
had
the
right
to
buy
that
remaining
5,000
acres
because
it
held
the
right
of
preemption.
so
it
may
be
that
the
oneidas
wanted
to
be
sure
that
they
could
reach
reasonable
terms.
and
they
did.
they
sold
all
that
land
within
the
following
six
years
after
consummation
of
the
treaty.
so
the
contemporaneous
history
squares
with
that.
it's
very
similar
to
what
happened
in
santa
fe
in
which
this
court
said
there
was
a
reservation
that
was
treated
for
the
santa
fes.
there
was
some
indication
of
acceptance
of
that
reservation
and
that
acceptance
was
decision
to
terminate
the
tribe's
sovereignty
over
any
land
outside
of
the
reservation
that
was
provided
to
them,
even
though
many
of
them
did
not
in
fact
remove
to
that
land.
here
the
oneidas
received
much
more.
not
only
did
many
of
them
sell
the
lands
and
leave
immediately
but
they
received
the
benefit
of
their
bargain
by
recovering
compensation
for
the
kansas
land
from
this
court
and
the
new
york
indians.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i
think
there
are
several
provisions,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
in
the
recital,
it
states
that
the
purpose
of
the
treaty
is
to
carry
out
the
government's
policy
in
removing
the
indians
from
the
east
to
the
west
of
the
mississippi.
article
2
also
notes
that
the
kansas
lands
will
be
a
permanent
home
for
all
indians
now
residing
in
the
state
of
new
york
as
well
as
elsewhere
and
article
4
states
that
there
will
be
an
exercise
of
sovereignty.
it
says
specifically
that
will
they
will
be
able
to
establish
their
own
form
of
government,
appoint
their
officers
and
administer
their
laws
in
the
kansas
land
specifically.
so
i
think
those
are
the
strongest
provisions.
i
would
also
like
to
touch
for
a
moment
if
i
can
on
the
question
that
several
members
of
the
court
have
raised
which
is
what
is
the
impact
of
this
decision
here.
from
the
perspective
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
localities,
it's
very
serious
because
it
does
concern
whether
or
not
the
tribe
can
unilaterally
regain
sovereignty
over
a
very
large
tract
of
land
in
central
new
york.
this
is
an
area
that
has
been--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--with
regard
to
a
narrower
parcel
of
land
than
what's
at
issue
here.
and
in
any
event,
the
court
expressly
did
not
pronounce
on
the
effect
of
the
buffalo
creek
treaty
here.
if
that's
the
case,
what
could
well
result
is
a
patchwork
quilt
of
jurisdiction
which
this
court
has
said
poses
tremendous
governance
problems.
it's
governance
by
tract
book.
this
is
not
just
hypothetical.
there
are
already
difficulties
that
have
started
to
arise
as
a
result
of
the
second
circuit's
decision.
for
example,
another
tribe
relying
on
the
decision
here
purchased
land
within
its
original
land
claim
area
that's
just
300
yards
from
a
local
high
school
and
have
begun
operation
of
a
gaming
hall
there.
the
locality
attempted
to
enjoin
operation
of
the
gaming
hall,
but
wasn't
able
to
do
so
in
light
of
the
second
circuit's
decision
below.
we
anticipate
there
are
will
be
many
other
problems
of
that
sort
that
will
arise.
the
residents
of
the
area
here
have
long
settled
justifiable
expectations.
the
settlement
patterns
are
clear
here.
the
absence
of
any
exercise
of
u.s.
jurisdiction
outside
a
very
small
plot
of
land
is
not
controverted.
these
are
factors
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
in
cases
like
hagen
and
yankton
sioux
are
relevant
to
the
question
of
both
what
the
contemporaneous
understanding
of
the
treaty
was
and
what
the
result
should
be
today
and
we
submit
that
they
should
lead
to
the
same
result
here
as
well.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
