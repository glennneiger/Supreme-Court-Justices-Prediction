mr.
michael
r.
smith
justice
stevens,
may
it
please
the
court:
there
was
a
suggestion
in
answer
to
an
earlier
question
that
the
oneidas
have
changed
their
position
about
whether
the
land
is
alienable
when
in
their
hands.
that's
not
correct.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that.
what
the
record
does
suggest
at
page
213
of
the
joint
appendix
is
that
sherrill
has
changed
its
position.
it
wand
an
easement
on
oneida
land
in
1997
and
at
that
page
of
the
appendix,
you
will
see
that
sherrill
went
to
the
department
of
the
interior
for
federal
approval
of
the
easement
under
federal
law,
understanding
at
the
time
the
oneida's
position
and
the
federal
law
principle
that
the
land
wasn't
subject
even
to
an
easement
absent
the
secretary's
approval.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
yes.
and
oneida's
actual
possession
of
the
land,
actual
possession
is
unified
with
their
underlying
federal
and
property
and
treaty
rights,
the
land
is
inalienable
and
cannot
be
sold
today
out
of
the
oneida's
position
any
more
than
it
could
200
years
ago.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
your
honor,
the
point
of
oneida
ii...
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
no,
your
honor.
there
is
an
unusual
twist
to
it.
it
arises
from
the
fact
that
there
were
illegal
transfers
200
years
ago.
there
was
a
suggestion
in
the
oneida
ii
decision
and
it
has
been
followed
by
the
lower
federal
courts
that
there
may
be
equitable
principles
that
constrain
remedies
and
a
course
of
order
to
be
entered
in
a
land
claim
action
brought
by
a
tribe
that
is
out
of
possession
but
the
equitable
principles
that
are
at
stake
here
are
very
different
and
they
don't
involve
the
same--
mr.
michael
r.
smith
--no,
justice
o'connor.
the
courts
have
ruled
that
we
may
not
do
that
and
it
is
the
position
and
i
will
state
it
clearly
here
today
that
the
oneidas
do
not
assert
a
right
to
evict
landowners
in
the
land
claim
area.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
we
are
not
asserting
a
right
to
evict.
we
are
not
waiving
any
of
the
underlying
rights
that
involve
right
to
possession
under
federal
law
and
aboriginal
rights
and
the
point
i'm
making
should
not
be
construed
that
way.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
we
are
not
asking
the
court
and
do
not
expect
the
court
to
evict
anyone
from
land
that
is
not
in
our
actual
possession.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
let
me
give
you
a
concrete
answer.
the
key
to
the
land
claim
is
approximately
one
quarter
of
the
oneida
land
claim
and
it
has
gone
to
judgement
and
is
on
appeal
in
the
second
circuit.
the
judgement
in
that
case
after
justice
and
interest
and
so
on
was
$250
million
and
it
was
rendered
against
the
state
of
new
york
only
as
the
initial
and--
mr.
michael
r.
smith
--approximately
one
fourth...
the
answer
is
64,000
acres.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
correct.
the
point
of
oneida
ii
is
that
it
damages
remedy
as
appropriate
to
a
tribe
out
of
possession
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
that
is
a
judicial
sale
of
the
underlying
federal
governmently
protected--
mr.
michael
r.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
well,
they're
entitled
to
two
items
of
value.
they're
entitled
to
retrospective
damages
for
trespass
and
in
that
the
court
has
not--
mr.
michael
r.
smith
--well,
there
is
one
plus
part
of
it
that
we
have
not
sued
upon
because
there
was
a
1798
federal
treaty
that
validated
the
transfer.
the
state,
which
feels
that
it
was
not
bound
by
the
nonintercourse
act,
twice
went
to
the
federal
government
for
formal
federal
treaty
approval
of
these
transactions.
one
of
them
went
through.
that
was
1798.
the
other
one
was
1802.
the
president
did
not
proclaim
it
and
the
state
never
went
back
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
the
decisions
of
the
court
in
cases
like
atkinson
and
montana
address
the
lack
of
power
of
a
tribe
with
respect
to
non
indian
freelance
within
a
reservation.
i
recognize
that
there
is
an
added
wrinkle
here
in
that
the
oneida's
rights
persist
in
that
land,
even
though
it
is
out
of
their
possession
and
that
wouldn't
have
been
true
in
atkinson,
montana
but
in
that
the
courts
have
held
that
the
possession
of
the
non
indians
as
lawful
in
the
sense
that
it
will
not
be
interrupted
and
the
land
title
can
be
passed
in
subsequent
transfers,
we
accept
the
proposition
that
montana
and
atkinson
would
prevent
the
oneidas
from
regulating
in
any
respect,
let
alone
tax
any
of
the
land
in
the
possession
of
non
indians.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
the
issues
of
laches
in
time
is
not
within
the
questions
presented
in
this
case,
notwithstanding
that
it
has
been
identified
in
earlier
decisions
and
was
actually
raised
by
the
counties
in
this
court
in
the
last
go
around.
laches
does
not
bar
this
claim.
these
were
illegal
transactions
declared
by
federal
statute
to
be
of
no
validity
in
law
or
equity.
the
oneida
ii
decision
which
holds
the
background
principles
of
federal
law
which
would
ordinarily
incorporate
state
statutes
of
limitation
don't
apply
because
their
intention
was
the
underlying
rule
that
only
congress
can
impair
or
extinguish
this
right.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
the
equitable
principles
that
would
inform
remedy
in
an
action
brought
by
a
tribe
out
of
possession
don't
apply
when
a
tribe
is
in
possession
or
else
there
has
been
a
judicial
extinguishment
of
an
underlying
right
that's
only
within
the
power
of
congress
to
extinguish.
the
court
has
been
clear
that
the
treaty
right
here...
we
have
a
federal
treaty
and
it
says
you
have
the
free
use
and
enjoyment
of
the
land
in
the
new
york
indians
won
the
court
said
that
means
the
same
promise
made
to
the
senecas
means
that
the
land
cannot
be
taxed.
the
argument
has
been
made
that
the
oneida's
only
rights
are
to
be
paid
off
now,
to
be
in
effect
have
the
un
extinguished
federal
aboriginal
right
and
the
un
extinguished
treaty
right
purchased.
those
rights...
literally
200
years
of
decisions...
are
within
the
sole
control
of
congress.
oneida
ii
made
pains
to
say
that
this
was
an
unusual
situation
of
thoughtless
intention
and
problems
but
those
problems
were
for
congress.
there
are
a
dozen
cases
from
this
court
that
deal--
mr.
michael
r.
smith
--they
did.
the
matter
was
litigated
in
the
second
circuit
and
resolved
adversely
to
the
oneidas,
but
i
would
take
the
position
that
the
treaty
of
canandaigua
actually
confirms
the
transfer
of
land
outside
of
the
retained
reservation
so
that
the
land
that
we
are
talking
about
today
as
retaining
the
oneida's
rights
i
think
is
approximately
270,000
acres.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
yes,
and
that's
why
i'm
not
saying
300,000
acres.
i
can't
do
the
arithmetic
and
i
don't
have
the
final
survey--
mr.
michael
r.
smith
--around
270.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
in
the
cayuga
case,
there
were
two
elements
of
damages.
one
was
retrospective,
and
that
was
rental
damages
for
past
trespass.
the
other
was
a
current
value,
because
judge
mckern
said
that
he
would
not
evict
anyone,
and
that
he
thought
a
suitable
alternative
to
eviction
was
the
award
of
value,
because
it
would
put
the
tribe
in
a
position
to
a
free
market
and
voluntary
relationship
with
the
purchasers
to,
quote,
"restore
its
homeland".
judge
mckern
got
really
to
the
heart
of
this
process
by
recognizing
that
there
are
inequities
all
around,
if
you
will,
and
that
the
court
is
without
the
power
to
extinguish
the
underlying
rights.
it's
congress'
role,
but
that
there
needs
to
be
a
sensible
way
of
recognizing
those
rights
today.
and
what
judge
mckern
decided
is
that
damages
would
put
the
tribe
in
a
position
to
do
what
the
oneidas
have
done
with
respect
to
the
land
that's
at
issue
here
before
the
court,
and
that's
to
make,
you
know,
a
fair
and
square
deal
and
pay
full
value.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
understand
your
question,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
correct.
i
mean
that's
the
end
of
that
litigation.
there
is
a
judgement,
it's
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it's
there
now.
the
issue
of
damages
remedies
when
the
tribe
is
out
of
possession
is
simply
conceptually
and
fundamentally
different
than
the
question
of
what
happens
when
the
tribe
has
joined
possession--
mr.
michael
r.
smith
--there
are
a
lot
of
parts
to
that.
let
me
respond
to
what
i
think
is
the
most
fundamental.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
that
argument
rests
on
the
idea
that
there
was
an
assumption,
at
the
time
of
the
treaty
of
buffalo
creek,
that
the
prior
transfers
were
valid.
it's
an
argument
of
ratification
by
assumption.
oneida
ii
says,
in
a
much
more
forceful
circumstance,
that
even
a
later
federal
treaty
that
explicitly
refers
to
the
prior
session
does
not
ratify
it,
because
the
ratifying
language
has
to
be
clear
and
express,
and
you
have
to
believe
that
both
the
indians
and
the
congress,
the
united
states,
meant
to
do
that.
here,
the...
if
you
think
about
it,
in
what
i
just
heard
concerning
buffalo
creek,
there's
an
interesting
asymmetry.
we're
supposed
to
assume
that
the
treaty
covered
all
the
land,
but
we're
not
supposed
to
conclude
that
ransom
gillet's
promise
is
covered
it
all.
we're
supposed
to
believe
that
one,
by
assumption,
extends
to
the
entire
reservation
and
that
the
other,
forceful
promises
of
a
federal
treaty
commissioner
that
you
need
not
go
anywhere,
are
actually
very
limited
and
carried
with
them
a
thought
that
they
were
extinguishing
rights
in
other
land.
that
interaction
with
ransom
gillet
is
crucial.
the
treaty--
mr.
michael
r.
smith
--the
representations
from
the
federal
treaty
commissioner
were
not
that
they
could
buy
it
back.
the
federal
treaty
commissioner
went
to
the
oneidas
because
they
would
not
agree
to
the
treaty.
they
didn't
want
to
give
up
their
rights.
he
gave
them
a
piece
of
paper
that
was
meant
to
assure
them
they
were
not
giving
up
their
rights.
there
was
no
suggestion
in
this
important
interaction
that
they
were
bargaining
over
the
loss
of
other
rights.
mille
lacs
is
directly
in
point
here.
mille
lacs,
i
think...
well,
from
mille
lacs,
you
can
derive
the
proposition
that
where
the
record
shows
no
bargaining
over
a
right,
and
where
the
treaty
does
not
refer
to
the
right,
the
indians
will
not
be
held
to
have
silently
yielded
their
important
rights.
in
the
nature
of
this
interaction,
you
have
the
suggestion
that...
you
have
a
far
more
important
right,
in
a
much
larger
part
of
the
reservation,
that
persisted
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
there
is
nothing
about
what
happened
at
buffalo
creek
that
would
suggest
that
anyone
would
think
they
were
affecting
the
oneida's
rights
in
lands
that
were
not
involved
in
the
treaty.
now,
the
treaty--
mr.
michael
r.
smith
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
smith
actually--
mr.
michael
r.
smith
--justice
scalia,
actually,
it's
interesting,
in
the
joint
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals,
at
page
413,
is
the
actual
document
that
governed
the
transfer
of
this
land,
the
state
statute;
and
in
that
statute,
the
state
granted
its
right
of
preemption
to
an
individual
to
acquire
the
land,
because
it
understood
that
it
had
not
yet
exercised
its
right
of
preemption.
that's,
in
the
conduct
of
the
parties,
a
direct
refutation
of
the
idea
that
the
right
of
preemption
was
exercised
in
the
treaty
of
buffalo...
in
the
treaty
of
fort
schuyler,
the
1788
treaty.
the
most
fundamental
point,
though,
about
the
1788
treaty
is
that
next
came
the
1794
treaty
of
canandaigua,
which
embodied
a
federal
promise
to
protect
the
free
use
and
enjoyment
of
this
land,
and
the
oneidas
possession
of
it.
and
that
exact
promise...
not
sort
of
like,
but
exact...
was
held
in
new
york
to
prevent
taxation
of
the
senecas
land.
i
guess
i'd
like
to
make
two
quick
points
before
i'm
out
of
time.
one
is
that,
with
respect
to
the
idea
that
it's
just
too
late,
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
question
is
not
presented,
i
want
to
emphasize
that,
in
section
2415
of
title
28,
congress
explicitly
focused
on
the
question
of
these
old
claims.
and
if
you
read
the
legislative
history,
all
they
talked
about
was
how
to
deal
with
the
oneida
claim
and
these
old
claims.
and
they
not
only
provided
that
title
claims
are
not
barred
by
statute
of
limitations,
and
established
the
limitations
period
that
would
not
have
run
against
the
oneidas
because
they
were
on
a
federal
list,
but
they
did
the
following,
which
i
think
is
notable.
the
statute
provides
that
these
claims
approved,
in
1966,
on
the
day
of
the
statute,
there
is
no
room
for
background
equitable
principles
in
federal
law.
where
congress
has
specifically
focused
on
a
problem
addressed
it,
the
idea
is,
i
suppose,
that
there
is
no
room
to
fill
gaps
here
by
the
court
when
congress
has
decided
just
what
the
gaps
are
and
how
to
fill
them.
the
other
point
that
i
would
make
concerns
the
treaty
of
buffalo
creek.
the
treaty's
language
leaves
it
to
both
sides
to
decide
whether
or
not
indians
are
going
to
kansas.
the
legislate...
the
history
of
the
treaty
shows
that
the
united
states
backed
away
from
any
language
which
would
oblige
it
to
remove
indians,
and
the
language
with
respect
to
the
indians
left
them
a
choice.
but,
ultimately,
all
of
that
is
controlled
by
what
happened.
the
federal
government
made
a
decision
that
no
indians
would
go
to
kansas.
the
idea
that
buffalo
creek
extinguished
reservations
in
new
york
would
seem
bizarre
to
anyone
in
new
york
today,
because
the
onondagas
have
reservations,
the
senecas
have
reservations,
the
st.
regis
have
reservations,
the
tonawandas
have
reservations,
the
tuscaroras
have
reservations,
and
the
oneidas
have
reservations.
it
didn't
extinguish
just
the...
there's
the
idea
that
you
can
look
at
this
in
a
vacuum...
it
didn't
just
extinguish
the
oneida
reservations.
under
the
santa
fe
rationale,
the
point
is
not
that
congress
ultimately
intended
two
reservations,
although
it
has
done
that
often...
the
choctaw,
the
mississippi
choctaw,
the
seminoles.
it
frequently
happened
with
removal
if
there
were
more
than
one
reservation.
but
here,
you
would
have
to
believe
that
congress
intended
no
reservations.
you
would
have
to
believe
that
congress
quickly
came
to
the
decision
that
none
of
these
indian
tribes
in
new
york
actually
had
a
reservation
anywhere,
and
that's
not
acceptable.
thank
you.
