it
couldn't
be
enforced
against
certain
innocent
purchases
but
when
the
land
is
reacquired,
then
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
ask
whether
there
was
an
extinction
of
aboriginal
title
and
whether
the
reservation
was
at
some
point
subsequently
disestablished
by
federal
act.
if
we
hold
against
you
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
extinction
of
aboriginal
title
and
there
was
no
disestablishment
of
the
reservation,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
when
they
reacquire,
we
get
to
exactly
the
point
that
justice
breyer
raised
and
that
is,
once
they
reacquire
the
land,
why
does
it
become
taxable?
why
does
its
nontaxable
status
not
simply
reassert
itself?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
if
the
original
establishment
of
the
reservation
was
simply
a
continuation,
was
literally
a
reservation
from
a
transfer
of
land
to
the
state
of
new
york
and
that
the
indian
title
was
a
purely
aboriginal
title,
not
a
title
conferred
by
a
federal
act
creating
reservations
but
it
cannot
be
indian
country,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
the
title
is
aboriginal.
nothing
in
an
act
of
the
united
states
says
we're
giving
you
this
land
to
the
indians,
e.g.,
in
the
kansas
situation.
it's
simply
aboriginal
title
and
it
was
never
extinguished.
are
you
saying
that
if
that
is
the
source
of
the
title
as
opposed
to
a
federal
act
saying
we
give
this
to
you,
that
it
cannot
be
indian
country?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
this
part
of
your
argument
depends
on
our
accepting
your
position
of
the
treaty
of
fort
schuyler
as
being
a
conveyance
of
all
property
and
a
later
retrocession,
is
that
correct?
because
otherwise,
i
don't
see
what
extinguished
the
aboriginal
title.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
say
terminated
the
title,
you
mean
by
the
conveyance
of
all
lands?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
means
that
that's
what
was
intended
but
what
do
you
make
of
all
of
the
testimony
about
the
representations
made
by...
i
forget
the
man's
name,
the
government's
representative,
to
the
effect
you
don't
have
to
leave.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
i
just
want
to
get
to
the
point.
doesn't
that
negate
your
argument
that
the
treaty
as
such
disestablished
the
reservation?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
the
oneidas
have
a
claim
to
tax
the
current
property
owners?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
was
there
any
positive
indication...
i
just
don't
remember
this...
in
the
new
york
case,
that
they
would...
that
they,
in
fact,
had
ceded
anything
of
new...
of
their
interest
in
new
york?
as
distinct
from
the
wisconsin
land.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
entering
into
the
treaty.
but
when
it
came
to
compensation,
was
there
an
indication
that
they
were
being
compensated
for
anything
other
than
kansas
land,
which
they
had
obtained
as
a
result
of
ceding
their
wisconsin
land?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
was
no
indication
that
they
got
kansas
for
anything
other
than
wisconsin,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
was
no
indication
that
they
had
ceded
anything
with
respect
to
title
in
new
york,
was
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,--
