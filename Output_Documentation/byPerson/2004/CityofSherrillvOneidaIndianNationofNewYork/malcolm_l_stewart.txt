mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address,
first,
the
city's
argument
that
the
long
passage
of
time
renders
it
improper
to
give
the
tribe
a
tax
exemption
on
lands
that
have...
recently
were
purchased.
that
argument
is
wrong
for
three
reasons.
first,
if
we
are
correct
that
the
tribe
had
federally
protected
title
as
of
the
1790s
and
that
that
federal
protection
was
never
validly
extinguished,
then
the
fact
that
the
tribe
was
out
of
possession
of
the
relevant
lands
for
nearly
two
centuries
is,
itself,
a
distinct
and
substantial
legal
wrong,
and
it
would
be
adding
insult
to
injury
to
say
that
precisely
because
the
tribe
had
suffered
that
initial
injury,
it
should
be
disentitled
to
take
advantage
of
a
tax
exemption
that
would
otherwise
flow
from
its
possession
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
it...
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish
between
two
different
types
of
delay.
what
was
at
issue
in
oneida
i
and
ii
was
delay
in
bringing
the
underlying
lawsuit.
and,
even
in
that
context,
the
court
said
that
the
suit
was
not
barred
entirely,
but
equitable
factors
might
be
taken
into
account
in
formulating
an
appropriate
remedy.
here,
we
don't
have
delay
in
filing
a
lawsuit.
that
is,
nobody
doubts
that
the
tribes
asserted
their
right
to
a
tax
exemption
promptly
after
repurchasing
the
relevant
land.
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
their
delay
in
purchasing
the
land
should
be
analogized
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--this
court
has
held
that
the
tribe...
that
a
tribe
may
abandon
aboriginal
title
to
land.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's
not--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
the
court
has
also
held
that
once
congress
creates
a
reservation,
once
it
confers
explicit
federal
protection
on
particular
lands,
the
reservation
can
be
diminished
or
disestablished
only
by
act
of
congress;
it
can't
be
terminated
through
adverse
possession.
and
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
delay
in
buying
the
land
should
be
analogized
to
delay
in
bringing
a--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the...
the
reservation
would
remain
a
reservation.
as
mr.
smith
pointed
out,
with
respect
to
parcels
within
the
reservation
that
are
not
owned
by
indians,
the
tribe's
regulatory
authority
is
extremely
limited
and,
therefore,
the
tribe
would
not
be
able
to
exercise
anything
like
plenary
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
the
whole
270,000
acres.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
court,
in
atkinson
trading,
and
in
montana
versus
united
states,
before
that,
that
said
that
the
tribe
may
be
able
to
regulate
conduct
on
non
indian
lands
to
the
extent
that
the
conduct
involves
voluntary
transactions
with
the
tribe
or
its
members
or
to
the
extent
that
the
regulation
is
necessary
in
order
to
protect
the
tribe's
sovereignty
over
the
land
that
it
possesses
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
agree.
in...
and
atkinson
trading
makes
clear
that,
even
when
the
great
bulk
of
the
land
is
only
by
the
tribe
or
its
members,
the
tribe's
ability
to
regulate
conduct
on
the
non
indian
parcels
is
sharply
limited.
that
would
be
doubly
true
in
a
tract
of
this
nature.
but
to
return
to
the
point
about
the
state's
reliance
interest,
i
think
it's...
or
the
city's
reliance
interest...
i
think
it's
important
to
stress
that
this
case
is
only
about
taxation,
and
a
municipality
can't
claim
to
have
the
same
sort
of
reliance
interest
in
being
able
to
tax
that
a
potential
defendant--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
true,
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--congress
does
have
the
power
to
deal
with
it.
and
at
the
end
of
the
court's
opinion
in
oneida
ii,
the
court
expressed
confidence
that,
up
to
this
point,
has
not
been
borne
out,
that
congress
would
fix
the
problem.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
has
recognized
the
tripe
all
along.
that
is,
under
the
treaty
of
canandaigua,
the
federal
government
was
required
to
pay
annuities
and
treaty
cloth
to
the
six
nations,
and
the
federal
government
has
done
that
continuously
since
the
beginning.
so
we've
always
recognized
this
to
be
a
tribe.
and
i
think
you're...
you've
put
your
finger
on
an
important
point,
justice
breyer,
in
that
the
court,
in
oneida
ii,
said
that
it
hoped
that
congress
would
fix
the
problem,
and
thought
that
it
would,
but
said
that
even
if
congress
doesn't
legislate
a
solution,
the
suit
can
go
forward.
the
court
contemplated
that
equitable
considerations
could
be
taken
into
account
in
formulating
a
remedy,
but
it
certainly
didn't
contemplate
that
the
tribe,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
would
be
left
without
any
remedy
at
all.
and,
as
you
point
out,
if
the
tribe
can
sue
for
damages,
it
seems
farfetched
to
think
that
it
wouldn't
be
able
to
reassert
the
tax
immunity
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
the
court
has
said...
the
court
has
said,
as
a
general
matter,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
a
tribal
merchant
on
tribal
land
can
be
required
to
collect
sales
taxes
from
non
indians,
at
least
for
the
purchase
of
goods
that
were
purchased
off
the
reservations.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
taxes
are
the
only
thing
at
issue...
are
the
only
thing
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
but
i
agree
that
holding
this
parcel
to
be
a
reservation
would
have
implications
for
regulatory
jurisdiction,
as
well.
now,
there
isn't
a
categorical
rule
of
federal
law
that
says
that
states
and
localities
absolutely
cannot
regulate
conduct
on
tribal
lands
within
the
reservation.
rather,
there
is
a
preemption
test...
there's
certainly
a
thumb
on
the
scale
in
favor
of
an
exemption
from
state
and
local
regulation
where
tribal
reservation
lands
are
involved.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
court,
in
the
new
york
indians
ii,
recognized,
to
start
with,
that
the
treaty
affected
an
immediate
session
of
the
oneida's
wisconsin
lands
to
the
federal
government,
and
the
court
specifically
noted
that
that
session,
in
and
of
itself,
would
be
sufficient
consideration
to
support
a
contract
between
private
parties.
so
it
simply
isn't
correct
to
say
that
the
new
york
oneidas
gave
up
something
other
than
a
promise
to
remove.
the
second--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
there
were
references
to
the
primary
inducement
to
the
federal
government's
entering
into
the
treaty
being
the
desire
for--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
no.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
compensation
was
strictly
for
the
kansas
lands
that
were
denied
to
them.
and
it's
important
to
note
that
the
senecas--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--they
got...
i
mean,
they
didn't...
they
weren't
held
to
have
promised...
made
a
commitment
to
remove
from
new
york.
no,
clearly,
in
analyzing
the
reasons--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
rested,
in
part,
upon
the
session
in
wisconsin.
it
rested,
in
part,
on
a
fairly
technical
argument,
to
the
effect
that
the
grant
of
kansas
lands
was
on
en
presente.
that
is,
it
was
a
present
grant
of
kansas
lands,
and,
therefore,
the
new
york
indians
could
be
disentitled
to
those
lands
only
if
they
had...
a
forfeiture
had
been
established.
and
the
court
looked
to
article
3
of
the
treaty
to
determine
the
conditions
for
forfeiture.
it
said
that
the
federal
government
would
have
been
required
to
allege
a
forfeiture
by
legislative
or
judicial
act,
et
cetera.
the
other
thing
i
really
wanted
to...
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
about
the
reliance
interest
of
the
taxing
jurisdiction
are
that
no
matter
how
long
a
particular
tract
has
been
taxable,
it
is...
may
i
finish
this
+/?
it
is
always
within
the
realm
of
a
city's
contemplation
that
it
may
be
bought
up
tomorrow
by
the
federal
government,
a
church,
any
other
tax
exempt
entity,
and,
consequently,
the
municipality
can
have
no
sense
of
repose
that
it
will
remain
taxable.
thank
you.
