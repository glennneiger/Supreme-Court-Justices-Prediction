justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
i
mean,
is
every
decision
we
make
up
for
review
when
the
interested
parties
fail
to
cite
what
they
now
assert
are
the
dispositive
acts?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
wouldn't
have
been
a
violation
of
federal
law
if
this
were
not
indian
country,
if
this
were
not
an
oneida
reservation
when
the
transfer
occurred.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
application
of
the
nonintercourse
act?
because
i
assume
it
was
only
the
federal
act
reservation.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
it
read?
what
does
it
say?
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
goes
with
the
taxes?
you
said
that
the
other
effect
would
be
that
whenever
the
oneidas
buy
a
piece
of
property
that
is
within
this
former
reservation
and
of
which
only
1
percent
is
now
owned
by
indians,
whenever
they
buy
a
piece
of
property,
that
property
is
taken
off
the
tax
rolls.
justice
antonin
scalia
which,
of
course,
makes
it
a
lot
easier
for
them
to
buy
it
because
it's
much
less
expensive
for
them
to
hold
that
land.
what
else
happens?
the
town
can't
regulate
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
assume
that
also
means
that
that
land
cannot
be
repurchased
by
non
indians?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
a
good
lawyer
that
they
hired
and
the
oneidas
may
not
have
hired
as
good
a
lawyer.
i
don't
think
this
was
done
around
the
campfire,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
the
fbi
that
keeps
peace
on
other
reservations.
isn't
it
quite
standard
for
state
law
enforcement
to
function?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure
it
can.
one
way
to
pursue
that
policy
is
to
offer
them
lands
in
the
west
if
they
want
to
go
there.
that
would
certainly
pursue
the
government's
policy
of
removing
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
there
is
no
consideration
if
they
simply
agree
to
remove
if
they
want
to
remove.
if
they
chose
to
ignore
it,
they
want
to
ignore
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
gave
none,
i'm
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
indians.
you're
saying
they
gave
no
promise
in
exchange,
if
they
simply
promised
to
remove
if
they
felt
like
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
trying
to
help
you
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
your
position
was
and
is
that
it's
not
inalienable
without
the
approval
of
defense?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
portion
within
the
reservation
you
claim
is
alienable
so
long
as
it's
not
owned
by
an
oneida.
current
owners
can
sell
it
to
somebody
else,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
isn't
there
any
principal
of
laches
that
comes
into
effect
here.
i
mean,
what
you're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
sanction
a
very
odd
checkerboard
system
of
jurisdiction
in
the
middle
of
new
york
state.
some
parcels
are
the
ones
the
indians
choose
to
buy
and
are
able
to
buy
are
called
indian
territory
and
everything
else
is
governed
by
new
york
state,
isn't
it?
it's
just
a
terrible
situation
as
far
as
governance
is
concerned
and
part
of
the
blame
for
the
situation
we're
in
is
that
the
oneidas
did
not
claim
about
this
for
170
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
case
also
held
that
because
of
the
passage
of
time
and
the
reliance
interest
that
has
developed,
we
are
not
going
to
give
you
possession.
now,
why
doesn't
the
same
principle
apply
to
giving
you
jurisdiction?
because
of
the
passage
of
time,
you
can
get
damages
for
trespass.
maybe
even
you
can
even
get
the
value
of
the
land.
it
would
just
create
a
chaotic
situation
if
we
say
that
you
have
jurisdiction
in
the
middle
of
new
york
state
over
any
pieces
of
land
that
you
can
buy.
justice
antonin
scalia
wall,
that's
not
the
end
of
it.
from
what
you're
saying,
i
gather
that
you
believe,
in
that
case,
once
they
purchase
the
land,
it
becomes
tribal.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
steward,
your
time
is
beginning
to
come
up,
and
there
is
one
thing
we
haven't
talked
about
that
i'd
really
like
to
get
your
view
on,
and
that
is
the
1788
treaty...
what
was
that,
fort
schuyler...
treaty
of
fort
schuyler?
justice
antonin
scalia
--between
new
york
state
and
the
oneidas.
now,
that
contained
language
which
said
the
oneidas
cede
and
grant
all
their
lands
to
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york.
that
was
the
operative
provision.
later
on,
it...
article
2
says,
"of
the
ceded
lands"...
the
ceded
lands,
lands
that
have
been
ceded...
"a
tract
described
by
metes
and
bounds
is
reserved
to
the
oneidas
to
hold
to
themselves
in
their
posterity
forever.
"
now,
i
would
normally
interpret
that
too
mean
that
the
oneidas
gave
up
all
of
their
sovereignty
over
the
lands
and
were
given
back,
by
the
state
of
new
york,
the
right
over
this
tract
designated
by
metes
and
bounds.
now,
i'm
saying
i
would
normally
interpret
that,
except
in
a
treaty
with
the
indians.
in
a
treaty
with
the
indians,
you
say,
"well"...
and
we
have
cases
which
have
language
somewhat
like
this,
and
they
say,
"well,
they
really
didn't
cede
the
part
that
they
reserved.
"
that
may
be
the
case
in...
ordinarily.
but
it
seems
to
me,
a
basic
principle
of
contract
law...
of
treaty
law,
of
any
law...
that
where
there
is
an
ambiguous
phrase
or
provision,
you
interpret
it
the
way
the
parties
themselves
have
interpreted
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
subsequent
history,
after
1788,
indicates
that
the
oneidas
believed
that
new
york
state
had
jurisdiction
over
that
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
new
york
state
police
were
in
there.
new
york
state
managed
the
lands.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
that
argument
at
all.
i
mean,
it's
just
a
general
rule
that,
where
you've
been
wrong,
you
have
to
come
forward,
in
a
timely
fashion,
to
get
the
wrong
righted.
and
what
difference
does
it
make
what
the
nature
of
the
wrong
is,
whether
it's
dispossession
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
isn't
just
taxes
we're
talking
about.
it's
jurisdiction
over
these
parcels
of
land.
it...
i
mean,
taxes...
that's
just
one
aspect
of
saying
that
this
land
no
longer
belongs
to
new
york
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
rested
upon
the
session
in
wisconsin?
