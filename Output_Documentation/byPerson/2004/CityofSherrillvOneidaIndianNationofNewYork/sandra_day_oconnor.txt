it
is
a
matter,
is
it
not,
of
whether
the
tribe
now
has
sovereignty
over
this
parcel
of
land,
is
that's
what's
at
the
bottom
of
the
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
tribe
has
sovereignty
status
with
regard
to
this
property,
then
presumably
this
city
can't
tax
it.
so
we
have
to
decide
that,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
we
do
with
the
oneida
ii
case
decided
in
1985?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
unless
made
by
treaty
or
convention
entered
into
pursuant
to
the
constitution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
sovereignty
something
that
the
tribes
can
lose
by
inaction
over
a
period
of
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
you
seem
to
be
asking
is
to
infer
from
that
treaty
that
the
prior
unlawful
land
sales
of
the
oneida's
new
york
reservations
were
somehow
ratified.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
you're
right
about
buffalo
creek,
it
would
mean
that
the
effect
of
the
government's
decision
to
repossess
something
in
kansas
was
to
leave
the
oneidas
without
any
land.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
certainly
wasn't
that
clear
from
it.
it
appeared
to
be
the
assumption
that
the
oneidas
did
not
have
to
go
to
kansas,
if
they
chose
not
to
do
it.
it
was
dependent
on
making
suitable
arrangements.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
are
implications
from
oneida
to
case
that
the
indians
can
reacquire
land
and
assert
some
kind
of
possessory
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
then
could
suits
be
brought
by
the
tribe
to
evict
current
owners
of
land
on
this
historical
oneida
300,000-acre
reservation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
it's
owned
by
the
state
of
new
york,
if
it's
been
acquired
somehow
by
the
state,
then
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
whole
300,000?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
kansas.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
a
tribe
can
never
lose
its
sovereign
rights
to
land?
can
it
acquiesce
in
the
loss
of
those
rights?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
we
have
held
that
a
state
can
abandon
sovereignty,
as
in
massachusetts
versus
new
york.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
might
give
them
a
right
to
some
kind
of
damages
for
a
violation,
but
what
does
that
do
to
the
sovereign
claims
of
the
tribe?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
congress
has
done
nothing
about
this,
has
it?
can...
has
the
tribe
asked,
administratively,
for
the
bureau
of
indians
affairs
to
recognize
it
now
as
a
tribe?
