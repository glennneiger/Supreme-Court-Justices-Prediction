justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
idea
of
precisely
what's
at
stake
within
the
oneida
litigation,
as
i
understand
it,
the
counties
and
the
municipalities
in
the
city
of
sherrill
would
not
be
left
in
the
end
having
to
pay,
new
york
would.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
from
the
county's
point
of
view,
i'm
asking
who
pays
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
it
seems,
in
the
oneida
case,
it's
the
state.
is
it
different
here?
and
what
taxes
are
we
talking
about
precisely?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
ever
any
federal
superintendent
of
the
land?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
smith,
at
first,
would
you
clarify
how
much
land
is
now
claimed
as
indian...
within
the
tribe's
aboriginal
right?
it's
not...
one
thing
clarify
while
you
are
not
claiming
the
entire
6
million.
didn't
they
have
6
million
acres
to
start
with?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
some
of
that
you
said
was
taken
up
by
an
approved
transfer
in
1798?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
something
around
275?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
figure,
the
250
million
is
for
the
rental...
what
is
that...
what
is
that
for?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
new
york
state
paid,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
it?
you
said
"extremely
limited".
this
is
the
first
i
heard
that
the
tribe
might
have
some
authority
over
part
of
that,
what,
the
275...
275,000
acres,
even
though
it
hadn't
repurchased
the
costs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
we're
talking
about
land
that...
where
there
are
no
tribe
members...
as
i
understand
it,
this
area
is
predominantly
non
tribal
members.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
tax...
what
taxes
are
we
talking
about?
is
this
property
tax?
are
we
also
talking
about
sales
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
properties
in
the
city
of
sherrill,
new
york,
purchased
in
open
market
transactions
by
the
oneida
indian
nation
of
new
york,
in
1997
and
1998.
on
the
properties
so
purchased
the
tribe
operates
a
gasoline
station,
a
convenient
store
and
a
textile
factory,
contained
within
the
300,000
acre
area
that
the
united
states
had
reserved
for
the
oneidas
at
the
end
of
the
18th
century.
the
recently
acquired
properties
were
last
possessed
by
the
oneidas
as
a
tribal
entity
in
1805.
governance
of
the
entire
area
for
two
centuries
has
been
provided
by
new
york
and
its
county
and
municipal
units,
and
for
generations,
the
parcels
of
land
in
question
have
been
subject
to
state
and
local
taxation.
in
a
1985
decision,
this
court
held
that
the
oneidas
stated
a
tribal
claim
for
damages
against
the
county
of
oneida
for
wrongful
possessions
of
lands.
the
oneidas
conveyed
to
new
york
in
1795,
in
violation
of
federal
law.
in
the
instant
action,
the
tribe
resists
the
payment
of
property
taxes
to
sherrill.
current
acquisition
of
fee
titles
to
discrete
parcels
of
historic
reservation
land,
the
tribe
maintains
revives
the
oneida’s
ancient
sovereignty
piecemeal
over
each
parcel.
consequently
the
tribe
urges,
regulatory
authority
over
the
newly
purchased
properties
has
reverted
to
the
tribe
and
no
longer
resides
in
the
city
of
sherrill.
the
tribe
prevailed
in
the
courts
below
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
the
parcels
of
land
acquired
by
the
tribe
in
the
1990s
qualify
as
indian
country,
immune
from
state
and
local
taxation.
we
reverse
that
judgment.
our
1985
decision
recognized
that
the
oneidas
could
maintain
a
federal
common
law
claim
for
damages,
for
ancient
wrongdoing
in
which
both
national
and
state
governments
were
complicit.
today,
we
decline
to
project
redress
for
the
tribe
into
the
present
and
future,
thereby
disrupting
the
governance
of
central
new
york's
counties
and
towns.
the
oneidas
long
ago
relinquish
the
reigns
of
government
and
cannot
regain
them
through
open-market
purchases
from
current
titleholders.
this
court
has
several
times
recalled
the
historic
wisdom
in
the
value
of
repose,
the
wrongs
of
which
the
tribe
here
complains
occurred
during
the
early
years
of
the
republic
yet
not
until
the
1970s,
to
the
oneidas
sued
local
governments
to
regain
possession
of
their
aboriginal
lands
and
not
until
the
1990s,
to
the
tribe
acquired
the
properties
in
question
and
demand
their
exemption
from
local
taxation.
our
decision
takes
into
account
these
salient
factors,
the
long
lapse
of
time
during
which
the
oneidas
did
not
seek
to
revive
their
sovereign
control
and
divest
new
york’s
to
equitable
relief
in
court,
the
attendant
dramatic
changes
through
development
in
the
value
of
the
properties
and
the
distinctly
non-indian
character
of
the
area
and
its
population
today.
these
considerations
combine
to
bar
the
tribe
from
gaining
the
disruptive
remedy
it
now
seeks.
that
remedy
would
yield
a
checkerboard
of
tribal
and
state
jurisdiction
created
unilaterally
at
the
tribe’s
behest.
the
alternating
town
and
tribal
control
would
significantly
confound
local
governance
and
would
adversely
affect
landowners
neighboring
the
tribal
patches.
recognizing
these
practical
concerns
congress
has
provided
a
mechanism
for
the
acquisition
of
lands
for
tribal
communities,
one
that
takes
account
of
the
interest
of
others
with
stakes
in
the
areas,
governance
and
well
being.
that
mechanism
set
out
in
25
u.s.c.
section
465,
provides
the
proper
avenue
for
the
tribe
to
reestablish
sovereign
authority
over
territory,
last
held
by
the
oneidas
200
years
ago.
in
sum,
the
question
of
damages
for
the
tribe’s
ancient
dispossession
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case
and
we
do
not
disturb
our
1985
decision.
but
given
the
extraordinary
passage
of
time
the
oneidas
long
delay
in
seeking
equitable
relief
in
court
against
new
york
or
its
local
units,
and
developments
in
the
city
of
sherrill’s
spanning
several
generations,
we
reject
the
piecemeal
shift
in
governance,
this
suit
seeks
unilaterally
to
initiate.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
