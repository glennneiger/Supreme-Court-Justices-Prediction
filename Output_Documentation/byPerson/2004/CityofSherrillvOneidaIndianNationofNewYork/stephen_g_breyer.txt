stephen
g.
breyer
why
does
not
having
a
possessory
right
mean
that
the
city
could
tax
them
or
the
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
just
thinking,
suppose
you
have
a
reservation
but
the
tribel
doesn't
have
a
possessory
right
because
in
the
middle
of
the
reservation,
there
is
some
kind
of
long
term
lease
or
sale
to
a
house
that's
owned
by
somebody
else
who
is
not
a
member
of
the
tribe.
i
would
think...
am
i
right
that
the
city
or
the
county
in
which
that
reservation
sits
can't
tax
it
anyway?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that
but
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
one
thing
that
oneida
establishes
is
that
the
whole
title
doesn't
just
disappear
if
nothing
else
happens
simply
because
of
the
passage
of
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we
agree
with
that
or
i
hypothetically
agree
with
that.
they
can't
come
in
and
eject
people.
but
then
i'm
back
to
my
first
question
because
i
take
it
that
the
refusal
in
oneida
to
the
suggestion
that
they
can't
go,
say,
to
buffalo,
new
york
or
wherever
or
some
town
and
throw
everybody
out
of
the
house,
that
that,
of
course,
does
reflect
the
passage
of
time.
but
for
a
city
or
state
to
tax
the
land,
that
doesn't
involve
the
same
kind
of
interference
with
people's
expectations
of
living
in
the
houses
that
they
bought,
that
throwing
someone
out
of
his
house
would
involve.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
perhaps
the
treaty
of
buffalo
creek
is
thinking
of
50,000
acres
where
these
particular
indian
tribe
members
have
their
homes
or
at
least
arguably.
just
no
one
was
thinking
about
the
remaining
300,000
because
they
had
long
left
those.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
precise
language
that
you
think
relinquished
changed
the
sovereignty?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
about...
suppose...
i
just
want
to
follow
this.
suppose
you
don't
evict
the
people
who
are
there
but
it's
22
square
miles
in
the
center
of
new
york
state.
that's
a
lot
of
land.
and
maybe
that's
worth
a
trillion
dollars,
i
don't
know.
so
does
that
mean
that
the
indian
tribe
would
have...
would
it
mean
that
it
would
have
the
right
to,
let's
say,
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars,
the
value
of
that
property
and
it
could
sue
someone
for
it,
the
state
of
new
york
or
the
federal
government?
i
guess
the
state
of
new
york?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
the
acreage
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
not
be
worth
as
much.
maybe
this
includes
several
cities
and
towns?
what
do
you
think
it
is?
in
other
words,
the
answer
to
my
question
is
in
principle,
yes.
in
principle,
if
the
indian
tribes
own
22
square
miles,
even
if
they
can't
get
possession,
they're
entitled
to
the
value
of
it,
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
of
course
the
people
who
are
there
have
it,
maybe
it's
not
buffalo.
i
don't
know,
maybe
it's
all
of
buffalo,
new
york,
or
maybe
it's
a
town.
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
the
law
but
i
just
wanted
your
view
of
that.
and
then
i
wanted
to
know
this.
on
the
legal
part,
i
would
like
your
response
to
the...
i
take
it
your
answer
is
yes,
they're
entitled
to
the
value
of
it,
which
i'm
right
about
that,
that
is
your
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
say
are
the
merits,
then,
to
the
claim
that
there
were
300,000
of
these
acres
in
1838
or
with
the
treaty
of
buffalo
creek...
there
were
300,000
acres
that
nobody
was
paying
any
attention
to
because
there
were
no
tribe
members
that
lived
there,
so
that
when
you
have
language
in
the
treaty,
under
those
circumstances,
that
says
their
home
is
now...
where
was
it?
illinois
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--kansas.
their
home
is
now
kansas.
that's
the
nation.
that's
the
place.
and
that...
you've
heard
the
language
cited.
and
even
though
a
person
says,
"you
can
live
here
as
long
as
you
want.
"
that
just
means
they
can
live
there
as
long
as
they
want;
that
doesn't
mean
it's
the
reservation.
the
reservation's
sovereignty
may
have
gone
to
kansas,
though,
of
course,
nobody
had
to
move,
unless
he
struck
a
fair
bargain
that
he
agreed
to
with
the
state
of
new
york.
i
take
it
that's
their
argument.
i
just
want
to
hear
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
that's
why
i
wondered
about
the
damage
part
of
it.
i'm
still
thinking
that
a
trespass
action
for
trespasses
that
occurred
in
1850
or
1700
is
worth
millions
today,
even
if
it's
tiny,
because
of
the
interest,
passage
of
time,
et
cetera.
when
you
add
that
to
the
value
of
the
land,
i'm
thinking
of
numbers
that
are
astronomical.
and
yet
that
hasn't
happened.
and
so,
what
actually,
as
a...
and
that's
why
i'm
thinking,
isn't
a
damage
action
far
more
serious
than
simply
taking
property
off
the
tax
rolls?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
why
i
want
to
know
how,
in
practice,
this
works
out.
does
congress
have
the
power,
for
example,
to
deal
with
it?
is
what
we're
considering
in
this
case
simply
a
negotiating
position
and
strengthening
people's
hands,
vis
a
vis
legislation?
what's
going
on?
