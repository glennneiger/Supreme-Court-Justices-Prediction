justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
your
position
that
whenever
an
indian
transfers
land
in
violation
of
the
nonintercourse
act,
that
that's
a
valid
transfer?
and
if
not,
why
is
this
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
if
you
were
to
say
the
tribe
does
not
have
a
possessory
right,
they
can't
go
and
eject
all
the
people
who
are
living
there
and
built
houses
over
the
last
192
years.
that
doesn't
mean
still
that
you
could
tax
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
not
it
be
odd
to
have
a...
to
give
assurance
that
you
could
buy
back
what
you've
lost?
does
it...
would
that...
that's
a
very
strange
construction
of
the
representations
intendant
upon
buffalo
creek.
i
understand
what
you're
talking
about
with
the
5,000
acres--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
stuart,
i
have
one
question
about,
buffalo
creek.
if
we
hold
that
buffalo
creek
didn't
disestablish
the
reservation,
then
doesn't
the
new
york
indian
case
rest
on
a
false
premise
because
that
case
gave
$2
million
for
failure
to
give
the
kansas
lands?
