justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
there's
a
difference
here
between
the
interest
of
a
small
party
and
a
large
one.
a
small
party
would
like,
if
there
is
a
deadline,
to
be
as
close
to
the
election
as
possible
so
voters
have
a
chance
to
get
fed
up
with
the
two
big
parties.
[laughter]
that's
their
chance.
a
big
party
would
like
it
to
be
further
away
because
then
they
can
plan
how
their
election
campaign
is
going
to
be.
has
any
of
this
been
litigated
below?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
that
inconsistent?
because
i
mean,
you're...
you're
basically
advocating
that
the
constitution
requires
alaska's
rule,
and
i
thought
that...
we
got
briefs
on
that,
i
think,
in...
in
the
previous
case
and
a
lot
of
other
parties
thought
alaska's
rule
was
not
a
wise
rule,
though
that's
up
to
alaska.
but
to
think
that
the
constitution
requires
that
is
surprising.
the
interest
they
assert
is
just
the
one
you
said--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
the
republicans,
in
order
to
have
their
party
work,
have
to
be
able
to
plan
a
campaign
for
a
stable
group
of
voters.
they
have
to
know,
roughly,
who
is
in
their
party,
let's
say,
a
week
before
or
2
weeks
before,
some
period
of
time
before.
and
that's
the
interest
that
oklahoma
is
asserting.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
you.
it
has
do
with...
and
it
has
zero
to
do
with
you
if
you
had
a
rule
for
minor
parties,
frankly.
but
if
you
can't
get
a
rule
for
minor
parties,
special,
then
you
have
to
take
it
seriously
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
answer?
what
do
you
respond--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
states
do
but
to
say
that
the
constitution...
and
i'm
asking.
you
see,
i'm
not...
but
i...
if
i
could
figure
out
how
in
the
constitution
you
had
a
special
rule
for
minor
parties,
the
interest
that
they're
asserting
has
very
little
to
do
with
it.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
have
a
constitutional
rule
that
would
forbid...
allow
you
to
open
and
drain,
but
wouldn't
allow
the
dems
to
do
the
same
as
they've
done
in
alaska.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
because
they
say...
what
they're
thinking,
i
take
it...
i
don't
know
what
they're
really
thinking,
but
i
imagine
they
could
be
thinking,
no,
we
don't
want
to
open
our
primary.
we'll
run
the
risk
that
our
voters
go
over
and
vote
for
the
dems
and
like
it
there
and
stay.
we'll
run
that
risk,
but
we
don't
want
them
coming
and
raiding
us.
we
think
that's
the
bigger
risk.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
can
the
constitution
tell
them
that
they
can't
make
that
judgment?
that's
what's
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
go
back
to
my
interest,
the
one
i
asserted--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
isn't
that.
it
is
the
interest
in
the
republican
party
in
alaska
saying
to
itself
we
do
not
want
our
voters
to
go
leave
and
vote
for
the
democrats
because
we
want
a
stable
body
of
people
3
or
4
weeks
before
the
election
for
whom
we
can
plan.
we
don't
want
to
open
ours
because
we
don't
want
the
raiding.
we
want
to
keep
them--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no.
it's
not
an
ownership,
but
you
have
a
period
of
time.
so
you
focus
on
the
period
of
time.
they're
saying,
of
course,
up
to
x
period
of
time,
they
take
their
choice.
is
this
a
fake
thing,
a
fake
reason,
the
need
to
have
a
stable
group
of
people
for
whom
you
plan
your
campaigns?
now,
is
that
a
hoax
or
is
it
flimsy
or
is
it
serious?
what
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then...
then
if
you
say
that...
i
want
you
to
just
respond
in
detail
to
the
questions
that
i
think
justice
scalia
and
justice
souter
were
asking,
as
i
understand
it,
putting
it
dramatically,
that
if
you
win
this
case,
alaska's
system
becomes
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now,
that
i
know
you
think
is
not
so,
and
i
want
to
know
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
there
be
a
way...
suppose,
for
hypothetical
purposes,
the
court
were
to
say...
you
got
a
ruling
that
said
there
is
no
rule
in
the
constitution
that
forbids
a
state,
as
a
general
matter,
to
forbid
this
cross
registration,
this
jumping,
for
a
reasonable
time.
but
a
reasonable
time
has
to
take
into
account
the
interests
of
minor
as
well
as
major
parties.
now
are
you
foreclosed
because
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
from
litigating
whether
8
weeks
is
a
reasonable
time
and
whether
the
disjunct
between
the
period
where
you
become
a
party
and
that
8
weeks
is
unreasonable
in
the
circumstances
or
other
specific
things
that
you
say
work
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
libertarians?
