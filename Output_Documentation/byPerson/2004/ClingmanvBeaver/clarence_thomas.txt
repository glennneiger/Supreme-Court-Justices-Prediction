justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
a
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
oklahoma
has
a
semi
closed
primary
in
which
a
political
party
may
invite
only
its
own
party
members
and
registered
independents
to
vote
in
that
party's
primary.
during
the
2000
election
cycle
the
libertarian
party
of
oklahoma
or
lpo
wanted
to
open
its
party
primary
to
all
registered
oklahoma
voters
regardless
of
their
party
affiliation.
the
state
election
board
agreed
as
to
independent
voters
but
not
as
to
voters
registered
with
other
political
parties.
the
lpo
and
several
republican
and
democratic
voters
then
brought
this
law
suit
alleging
that
oklahoma's
semi-closed
primary
system
unconstitutionaly
burdens
their
first
ammendment
right
to
freedom
of
political
association.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
it
concluded
that
the
state's
semi-closed
primary
system
imposed
a
severe
burden
on
associational
rights
and
thus
was
constitutional
only
if
the
system
was
narrowly
tailored
to
serve
a
compelling
state
interest.
finding
none
of
oklahoma's
interest
compelling
the
court
of
appeals
enjoined
oklahoma
from
using
its
primary
system.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
electoral
regulations
are
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
only
if
they
impose
severe
burdens
on
associational
rights.
however,
oklahoma's
semi
closed
primary
system
places
a
minor
burden
on
parties
and
voters.
registered
members
of
the
republican,
democratic,
and
reformed
parties
who
wished
to
vote
in
the
lpo
primary
need
only
file
a
form
with
the
county
election
board
secretary
to
change
their
registration.
with
nominal
effort
they
are
able
to
vote
in
the
lpo
primary.
for
the
same
reason
the
lpo
need
only
persuade
voters
to
make
the
minimal
effort
necessary
to
switch
parties.
oklahoma
may
impose
such
minor
barriers
between
voter
and
party
to
serve
important
regulatory
interest.
oklahoma's
semiclosed
primary
system
advances
a
number
of
important
interests.
it
preserves
political
parties
as
viable
and
identifiable
interest
groups
enhances
parties
electioneering
and
party
building
efforts
and
guards
against
party
rating
and
soar
loser
candidacies
by
spurned
primary
contenders.
in
the
face
of
such
interest
we
have
repeatedly
upheld
reasonable,
non
discriminatory
regulations
such
as
oklahoma's
semiclosed
primary
law.
oklahoma
remains
free
to
allow
the
lpo
to
invite
all
registered
voters,
whatever
their
party
affiliation
to
vote
in
their
primary,
but
the
constitution
leaves
that
choice
to
the
citizens
of
oklahoma.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justice
breyer
joins
in
part;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
souter
joins
in
part
and
justice
ginsburg
joins
in
full.
