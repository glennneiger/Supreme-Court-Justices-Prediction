well,
of
course,
i
guess
from
the
standpoint
of
the
libertarian
party,
it's
kind
of
a
problem
because
a
voter
who
wants
to
disaffiliate
under
oklahoma
law
with
their...
their
prior
registration
have
to
do
it
basically
8
weeks
ahead,
at
which
time
they
don't
know
if
the
libertarian
party
will
even
qualify
for
having
a
primary.
i
mean,
it
just
gives
them
a
very
impossibly
short
window.
if
the
time
were
reasonable,
that
might
be
a
different
picture,
but
isn't
that
kind
of
burdensome?

well,
i
guess
the
one
other
concern
would
be
the
timing
in
oklahoma
is
such
that
the...
the
republican
or
democrat
who
wants
to
disaffiliate
in
order
to
vote
with
the
libertarians
has
to
do
so
at
a
time
before
the
state
has
decided
whether
to
allow
the
libertarian
party
on
the
ballot.
so,
you
know,
it
probably
isn't
burdensome
to...
in
principle,
to
have
some
disaffiliation
requirement,
but
does
the
state
have
to
allow
enough
time
so
that
the
decision
can
be
made
with
knowledge
of
whether
the
libertarians
are
going
to
be
on
the
ballot?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
it
might
be
more
burdensome
on
the
voter
in
that
situation.
