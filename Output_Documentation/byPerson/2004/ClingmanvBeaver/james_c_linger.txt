mr.
james
c.
linger
justice
stevens,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
integrity
of
a
political
party
should
be
defined
by
the
political
party
and
not
by
the
state.
the
state
interest
that
they
have
asserted
here
and
alleged
is
to
prevent
against
draining,
and
draining
the
state
has
defined
as
the
inverse
of
raiding.
now,
raiding,
of
course,
is
the
state
preventing
and
keeping
out
of
a
political
party
disloyal
voters
of
another
party
coming
in
for
a
purpose
to
hurt
that
party.
now,
if
draining
is
inverse
raiding,
then
the
state
is
saying
that
it
has
an
interest
in
keeping
in
to
a
political
party
disloyal
voters.
so
the
state
is
asserting
and
is
at
cross
purposes
that
it
has
an
interest
to
both
keep
out
disloyal
voters
from
a
political
party's
primary
and
at
the
same
time
keep
in
disloyal
voters.
mr.
james
c.
linger
and--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--most
states--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--justice
breyer,
most
states
have
a
rule
for
minor
parties.
they
don't
treat,
like
oklahoma
does,
you're
either
a
party
or
you're
a
nothing.
mr.
james
c.
linger
i
think
in...
in
alaska,
of
course,
right
now
there
is
a
party
option
where
all
the
parties
but
the
republicans
have
opened
the
primary.
they
have
a
blanket
primary.
the
republicans
haven't
and
the
republicans,
of
course,
in
alaska
happen
to
be
the
dominant
party.
there
seems
to
be
a
pattern
in
these
cases--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--and...
and
that--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--i
don't
think
the...
i
think
the
constitution...
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
it
is
legitimate
to
protect
against
raiding
because
we
can
all
suppose
how
disloyal
voters
coming
into
a
party
could
hurt
it.
but
how
about
disloyal
voters
leaving
a
party?
because
these
voters
that
would
come
in
and
vote
in
the
libertarian--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--yes.
mr.
james
c.
linger
and,
justice
breyer,
that
sort
of
first
amendment
view
of
your
voters
shows
that
the
party
thinks
that
they
own
the
voters.
we
hear
this
language
where
the
party
is
contributing
voters
or
they're
being
poached
or
it's
a
donor
party.
that
shows
a
certain
view
of
the
party
and
what
they--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--i...
i
think
it
is
flimsy
and
i'll
tell
you
why
because
i
think
paternalistically
the
state
of
oklahoma
is
way
off
or
the
republican
party,
if
they
thought
that
way
in
alaska,
would
be
off.
if
you
really
think
about
it,
a
party,
particularly
at
the
general
election,
wants
its
loyal
voters
to
get
to
the
poll.
actually
this
would
be
a
benefit
to
the
republican
and
democratic
parties
in
oklahoma
or
the
republican
party
in
alaska
because
it
allow
them
to
find
out
which
of
their
voters
had
voted
in
their
primary
and
which
had
defected
to
another
party.
when
they're
sending
out
mailers
or
doing
phone
banks
or
driving
people
to
the
polls,
they're
going
to
want
to
take
their
loyal
voters.
so
this
will
actually
serve
to
help
them
to
identify
some
of
their
voters
who
aren't
loyal,
and
they
won't
want
to
bring
them
in.
so
i'm
saying
that--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--because
it's...
it's
not
practical
on
what
happens.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
in
her
questions,
there
is
such
a
limited
time.
the
libertarians,
as
shown
in
the
record
in
this
case,
have
never
and
continually
do
not
have
the
time
to
build
up
a
voter
pool.
they
have
their
supporters
spread
out
among
a
number
of
political
affiliations
because
there's
such
a
little
amount
of
time
that
you
can
register
as
a
libertarian,
unlike
the
vast
majority
of
states.
i
don't
think
anyone
has
ever
accused
the
libertarian
party
of
not
having
a
set
philosophy
on
what
they
stand
for.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter,
this
court
itself
has
expressed
skepticism
about
whether
even
party
raiding
ever
exists.
people
don't
go
out
generally
to
vote
because
they
want
to
pick
someone
who's
a
bad
candidate.
they
want
to
vote
for
someone
they
feel
proud
of
who
expresses
their
views.
the
people
that
the
libertarians
would
appeal
to
would
be
republicans
and
democrats
who
either
weren't
going
to
vote
in
their
primary
or
those
who
were
very
libertarian
oriented
or
people
who
would
be
libertarians
if
they
had
more
opportunity
under
the
law
to
register
as
libertarians.
they're,
in
effect,
marooned--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--over
these
other
affiliations.
mr.
james
c.
linger
who
would
they
attract?
they
would
attract
libertarian-oriented
people
who
would
be
drawn
by
their
philosophy
because
the
libertarian
party,
as
with
most
minor
parties,
is
an
ideological
party.
they
take
positions
oftentimes
ignored
by
the
major
parties,
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--if
you
can
tell--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--of
course,
this
court,
i
think,
has
recognized
that
raiding
is
not
a
legitimate
concern
for
the
state
that
overcomes
a
party
that
would
open
up.
and
that's
what
the
district
court
so
held.
we
go
into
the
inverse
of
draining
and
talk
about
the
effect
it
would
have
on
the
republicans
and
democratic
parties.
i
think
the...
the
district
court
said
several
times
in
its
opinion
that
the
results
would
be
highly
speculative.
but
i
say
that
the
results
would
probably
be
to
the
benefit
because
it
would
ensure
major
parties
that
they
got
a
nominee
who
was
picked
by
loyal
supporters
of
the
party,
and
what
would
be
drained
off
would
be
disloyal
supporters
who
would
rather
be
doing
something
else.
and
that,
of
course,
is
the
essence
of
competition.
we
should
not
be
worrying
about
protecting
the
major
parties
from
competition
for
ideals.
this
is--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--the
finding
of
the
tenth
circuit
was,
of
course,
that
it
applied
to
these
plaintiffs
under
these
particular
facts.
and
i
think
that's
one
thing
to
remember,
how
cautious
and
conservative
this
court
and
the
first
circuit
in
cool
moose
were.
they
didn't
make
a
broad-based
rule,
and
i
don't
interpret
this
decision
and
i
don't
interpret
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
footnote
13
in
tashjian
is
that
we
should
come
down
and
make
some
bright
line
rule
that's
always
going
to
say
we
have
to
have
a
party-option
open
primary
or
not.
we
need
to
look
at
the
factors.
i
think
there
are
very
few
states
that
this
would
even
apply
to
because,
as
we
know,
21
states
don't
even
have
political
party
registration.
mr.
james
c.
linger
i
do...
i
do
ask
that
the
state
legislatures
think
about
what
they're
doing.
and
as
i
demonstrated--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--i'm
saying
that
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
think
courts
should
ever
go
out
and
look
for
cases
in
advance.
we
look
at
the
case
that
is--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--about
the
effects.
mr.
james
c.
linger
no.
i'm...
and
as
i
said
before,
i
think
the
political
party
should
be
the
one
that
defines
its
integrity--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--because,
number
one,
first,
let's
eliminate
the
21
states
that
do
not
have
political
party
registration.
they
would
not...
in
fact,
the...
the
problem
that
we're
worried
about
here,
draining,
and...
and
the
problem
is
going
to
happen
simply
because
people
in
those
states,
like
president
bush's
texas,
are
free
from
election
to
election
to
go
to
any
primary
they
want--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--justice
scalia,
i
respectfully
disagree
because
alaska,
unlike
texas,
has
political
party
registration.
also,
they
have
a
party
option.
and
most
states
that
have
political
party
registration,
in
fact,
have
a
sort
of
two-tier
system
where
they
recognize
it
would
be
discriminatory
to
treat
major
parties
and
small
political
parties
the
same.
most
of
them
like,
for
example,
the
amici
states
here
of
new
mexico,
maryland,
they
have
political
conventions
for
their...
they
recognize
that
that
is
something
that
shouldn't
be
applied
to
the
smaller
parties.
but
oklahoma,
of
course,
mandates
primaries.
the
libertarians
of
oklahoma
are
forced
to
have
primaries.
they're
forced
to
live
under
what
is
the
most
restrictive
ballot
access
and
ballot
retention
laws,
which
limits
the
amount
of
time
they
could
be
on
the
ballot.
the
voter
registration
laws,
as
was
cited
in
the
record
of
this
case,
as
the
trial
judge
found,
of
the
29
states
that
have
political
party
registration,
essentially
26
of
them
have...
they
have
free
and
open
registration.
there
are
very
few
that
limit
things
across
the
board
like
oklahoma
does,
and
that's
what
makes
this
case
unique.
and
i
think
the
footnote
13
in
tashjian
talked
about
looking
at
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances.
i
think
this
case
gives
the
court
an
opportunity
to
fully
expand
on
that
footnote,
the
full
footnote,
of
course,
as
i
cited
in
the
brief
for
the
respondents,
and
that
is
to
say
that
all
these
are
factors
when
you're
analyzing
any
state.
is...
does
it
have
political
party
registration?
does
it
mandate
primaries
for
even
the
little
parties?
how
much
time
is
available
to
change
your
registration
as
new
parties
come
up?
the
new...
state
of
new
hampshire,
of
course,
has
found
a
way
to
deal
with
this
problem,
which
oklahoma
hasn't,
which
is
that
they
allow
new
parties
that
are
just
recognized.
where
many
voters
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
register
in
that
party,
they
have
an
open
primary.
that's
one
way
to
deal
with
it.
but
the
point
is
oklahoma
didn't
even
think
about
that.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
sore
loser
provision
where
you
have
to
be
affiliated
with
a
party
for
6
months...
the
legislature...
when
the
first
time
the
libertarians
got
on
the
ballot
25
years
ago,
they
didn't
even
realize
that
there
was
no
way
you
could
be
affiliated
with
a
party
for
6
months
because
you
couldn't
register
with
it.
and
the
law
and
the
workings
of
all
these
registration
laws
in
oklahoma,
because
they
are
so
restrictive,
prevent
the
libertarian
party
to
get
in
the
position
that
the
major
parties
have
because
they
simply
can't
get
their
people
registered
and
stay
registered
with
the
libertarian
party
because
they're
constantly
being
purged
and
they're...
the
people
are
frustrated.
mr.
james
c.
linger
i
think
that's
something
reasonable,
but
in
this
case
it
is
unreasonable
because
you
simply
don't
have
the
opportunity
to
register.
remember
this--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--that...
that
is
part
of
the
appeal.
there
are
obviously
some
people
simply
because
of
family
tradition
or
it
may
help
them
with
their
job
or
because
the
libertarians
are
controversial,
some
people
may
want
to
keep
it
quiet
and
don't
formally
affiliate
other
than
they
might
wish
to
vote.
but
our
appeal
and
request
was
not
simply
those
people
but
to
many
people,
the
vast
majority
of
oklahomans
who
never
vote--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--a
person
can
do
that,
yes.
and,
of
course,
independents
are
growing.
i
think,
as
you
know--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--we
would
like...
first,
when
you
have
competition
in
ideals
and
in
politics,
it's
always
a
continuing
process,
and
they're
hoping
to
win
all
these
people
over.
they
don't
want
these
people
to
stay
in
other
political
parties,
but
they
are
opening
it
up
because
they
have
such
a
limited
period
of
time
in
oklahoma
when
people
can
formally
affiliate
with
the
libertarian
party
or,
for
that
matter,
any
newly
recognized
party.
think
of
it
this
way.
when
counsel
was
talking
about
the
rosario
case
where
you...
the...
the
state
was
allowed
to
have
8
to
11
months
and
the
court
found
that
was
acceptable
to
change
your
registration
or
the
older
case
of
kusper
v.
pontikes
where
the
court
found
that
23
months
in...
in
advance
to
change
your
affiliation
was
too
much,
in
oklahoma,
whether
it's
23
months
before
the
newly
affiliate
party
gets
recognized
or
8
to
11
months,
you
can't
register
with
that
party.
so
if
it
was
unreasonable
in
kusper
v.
pontikes
but
was
reasonable
in
rosario,
the
point
is
under
either
of
those
time
periods,
in
oklahoma
you
can't
register
with
a
newly
recognized
political
party.
so
how
can
that
be
reasonable?
the
libertarians
do
not
have
the
opportunity.
newly
recognized
parties
under
oklahoma
law
do
not
have
the
opportunity
to
get
their
people
in
in
time,
to
the
extent
they
could,
as
demonstrated
in
the
record
by
states
of
similar
population
like
kansas
and
arizona
and,
as
i
noted
in
the
brief,
oregon
where
there
are
substantially
more--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--as...
as
to
the
libertarians,
we
asked
that
we
have
a
party-option
open
primary,
which
i
think
is
acceptable,
and
it's
what
new
hampshire
does.
mr.
james
c.
linger
if
you
go...
if
you
go--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--the...
the
legislature...
if...
if
the
law
is
overturned
and
the
tenth
circuit
is
affirmed,
the
legislature
might
go
back
in
then
and
address
the
problem
and
they
might
come
up
with
some
solution
as
they
did
back
in
1980
when
it
became
apparent
to
them
that
they
had
set
up
a
system
where
libertarian
candidates
couldn't
be
candidates
for
state
office
because
they
couldn't
be
affiliated
with
a
party
with
6...
for
6
months.
they
made
the
change
that
is
set
forth
in
the
statute
that
allows
15
days
after
the
party
is
recognized.
it
might
very
well
be
that
a
possibility
the
legislature
could
pursue
that
could
solve
this
problem,
a
problem
created
by
the
state
of
oklahoma,
would
be
to
allow
a
period
of
time
after
a
party
is
recognized
for
voters,
not
just
candidates,
but
for
people
who
just
want
to
vote
in
the
primary
to
change.
that
might
be
one
solution.
or
it
might
be,
as
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
where
they
allow
that
if
it's
a
newly
recognized
party
and
we
recognize
that
all
these
people
in
the
state
never
had
the
opportunity
to
register
in
this
party,
then
they
will
have
an
open
primary
there.
so
i
don't
think
there's
one
solution
for
this
problem,
and
i
think
when
the
law,
hopefully,
is
held
to
be
unconstitutional
as
it
applies
to
libertarians,
then
the
oklahoma
legislature
can
come
in
and
perhaps
remedy
the
situation
then.
now,
this...
this
case
is
one
in
which
there
are
some
other
factors
that
have
to
be
considered,
and
that
is
the
importance
that
is
put
on
first
amendment
rights
to
political
association.
the
state
of
oklahoma,
contrary
to
the
brief
of
the
petitioners,
has
not
been
overburdened
with
minor
political
parties.
it
is
a
state
in
which
only
in
presidential
elections,
by
petitioning,
have
parties
even
been
able
to
gain
ballot
status.
the
state
has
also
a
very
severe...
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
found
that
the
retention
requirement
of
10
percent
for
every
general
election
for
the
top
of
the
ticket
was
very
difficult.
the
finding
was
that
the
registration
here
was
among...
very
limited
and
among
the
most
difficult.
and
finally,
the
state
has
imposed,
i
think
unwisely,
primaries
on
these
small
political
parties.
but
other
than
the
libertarians
and
the
reform
party,
there
have
been
no
other
minor
parties
on
the
oklahoma
ballot.
in
this
situation,
we
have
to
say
to
ourselves,
as
the
trial
judge
in
fact
commented
on,
is
whether
or
not
the
law
is
simply
the
result
of
the
concerns
of
the
major
parties.
i
do
not
think
that
the
state
legislature
in
oklahoma
went
out
of
its
way
to
try
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
libertarians.
i
just
think
that
they
never
really
considered
them,
and
that
is
why
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
when
the
rights
of
independent
voters
and
small
parties
are
impacted
by
legislation,
that
this
court
should
exercise
more
strict
and
careful
scrutiny
there
because--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--because
that
was
a
candidacy
right,
what
the
candidate
was
going
to
do,
and
in
that
particular
case,
this
court
noted
that
the
candidate
of
the
democratic-farmer-labor
party
had
a
choice.
that
candidate
could
have
choosen
to
be
the
candidate
of
the
new
party
or
that
he
could
stay,
as
he
did,
with
the
democratic-farmer-labor
party.
we
don't
have
the
choice
here.
they
wanted
to
have
him
be
the
candidate
of
both
parties
at
the
same
time.
we
recognize
that
the
state
may
properly
limit
each
voter
to
a
single
nominating
act,
to
a
single
vote,
and
we're
not
asking
that.
we're
not
asking
that
the
state
not
be
allowed
to
set
reasonable
times
to
let
them
know
about
what
we're
going
to
do.
but
in
timmons...
and
i
think
timmons
is
what
led
the
district
court
astray
here
was
what
was
not
recognized
was
that
there
was
a
choice
allowed
in
timmons,
and
there's
not
a
choice
here.
if...
if
this
had
been
in
oklahoma,
in...
in
that
regard,
there
would
have
been
no
way
for...
there's
no
way
for
a
voter
who's
in
the
republican
or
democratic
parties
who
wants
to
vote
in
the
libertarian
party
because
of
the
unreasonable
deadlines
to
change
and
because
of
the
lack
of
opportunity,
there's
no
way
that
they
can
register.
so
they
don't
have
the
choice
to
register
as
a
libertarian,
as
the
candidate
of
the
democratic-farmer-labor
party
did
in
timmons,
to
change
if
he
wanted
to.
he
chose
to
stay
in
the
major
party.
but
that
is
one
significant
difference
with
timmons.
and
also,
of
course,
i
couldn't...
i
would
also
want
to
mention
that
minnesota
is
a
state
that
has
no
political
party
registration.
so
once
again,
the
problem
and
issues
we're
confronted
with
here
could
not
occur
in
minnesota.
but
i
think
that's
significant.
and
there
was...
there
was
nothing
on
any
voter
that
would
have
kept
them
from
being
able
to
vote
for
that
particular
candidate
in
the
general
election.
they
were
going
to
be...
he
was
going
to
be
on
the
ballot
in
the
general
election.
in
this
case,
the
voters
that
don't
have
the
choice
that
that
candidate
did
in
timmons,
they
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
express
their
opinion
on
a
party
that
they
would
like
to
express
an
opinion
in
in
their
primary.
and
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
distinction.
i
think
that
oftentimes
in
the
standard
that
the
court
uses,
that
there
is
a
difference,
sometimes
depending
on
which
particular
judge
writes
the
decision
on
how
a
standard
is
explained.
but
in
this
case,
it
is,
as
the
tenth
circuit
said
and
as
the
district
court
recognized,
something
that
lies
between
this
court's
decision
in
tashjian
and
this
court's
decision
in
california
democratic
party
v.
jones.
but
in
both
those
cases,
the
court
recognized
and
called
for
exacting
scrutiny
when
a
law
was
impacting
a
party's
choice
as
to
how
it
wishes
to
choose
its
nominees.
i
do
not
think
that
the
rationale
come
up
by
mistake.
this
thing
about
draining,
taking...
keeping
the
disloyal
voters
in
the
republican
and
democratic
party
and
not
letting
them
come
over,
whether
they
wouldn't
have
voted
at
all,
or
whether
they
didn't
have
the
chance
to
register
as
libertarians,
or
whether
they
simply
are
inspired
by
the
particular
candidates,
i
don't
think
in
that
situation
that
that
is
either
a
compelling
interest
by
the
state
and
i
certainly
don't
think
it
is
rational.
and
in
fact,
as
far
as
being
paternalistic,
i
think
the
state
is
totally
wrong
there
because
i
think
this
would
actually
benefit
the
major
parties.
but
i
am
saying
to
you
that
this
is
limited,
under
the
tenth
circuit's
decision,
to
the
facts
in
oklahoma.
and
in
other
states,
what
the
states
can
say
there,
if
it
comes
up,
is
what
is
a
difference
between
us
and
oklahoma
on
ballot
access
and
ballot
retention,
on
voter
registration
laws,
on
requirements.
do
we
allow,
like
a
number
of
the
amici
states,
to
have
our
minor
parties
select
by
political
party
convention?
but
all
of
this--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--the
amici,
amicus--
mr.
james
c.
linger
--amici.
mr.
james
c.
linger
amici.
okay.
in
any
event,
we
ask
that
the
court,
when
it
fully
considers
this,
under
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case
and
the
record,
that
the
court
will
affirm
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
