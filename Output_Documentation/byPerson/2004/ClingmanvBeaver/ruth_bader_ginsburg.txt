mr.
poe,
the...
the
district
court
in
this
case
rejected
all
grounds
except
one.
it
rejected
the
raiding
and
swamping.
it
said
that's
what
the
libertarians
want
to
expose
themselves
to.
it's
not
for
a
state
to
be
paternalistic
to
protect
them
against
their
own
bad
choices.
but
it
said
this
request
is
damaging
to
the
majority
parties,
to
the
major
parties,
because
it
poaches
on
their
members.
but
there
is
not
in
this
litigation
any
major
party
that's
complaining
about
that.
so
if
that
is
the
rationale
that
the
district
court
went
on,
can
this
court
possibly
oppose
it
when
there
is
nobody,
as
far
as
we
know...
they
haven't
even
come
into
this
case
at
this
level,
filing
a
friend
of
the
court
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
when
you...
would
you
say
that
the
rationale
on
which
the
district
court
rejected
the
libertarian
party's
claim
was
unsatisfactory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
a
basis
in
the
record
for
making
that
finding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
your
brief
to
say
that
this
constitutional
rule
that
you
are
seeking
would
be
just
for
the
minority
party?
i
think
you
said
in
your
brief
it
doesn't
follow
like
the
night
the
day
that
because
the
libertarians
must
be
allowed
to
do
this
by
the
constitution,
therefore
the
democrats
and
republicans
must
also
have
the
option
to
invite
anyone
into
their
primaries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
case
was
you
want
to
appeal
to
people
who
don't
want
to
register
as
libertarians
and
don't
even
want
to
be
independent.
you
want
to
appeal
to
people
who
are
and
want
to
be
members
of
the
republican
or
democratic
party
but
have
libertarian
leanings,
but
they
don't
want
to
give
up
their
party
affiliation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that
you
could
do
right
now,
and
you
say
that's
not
enough.
we
want
people
who
are
members
of
other
parties
and
don't
want
to
change
their
party
affiliation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
does
that
square
with
timmons
where
this
court
turned
away
a
party
that
says,
we've
got
this
candidate
and
she's
running
on
a
major
party
ticket
and
she's
happy
to
be
on
ours
too?
and
the
court
there
said
the
state
can
legitimately
eliminate...
limit
the
candidate
to
one
party
affiliation.
so
if
it
can
limit
the
candidate
to
one
party
affiliation,
why
not
the
voter?
