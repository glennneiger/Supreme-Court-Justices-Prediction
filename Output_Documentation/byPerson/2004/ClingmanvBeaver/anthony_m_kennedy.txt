in
line
with
justice
breyer's
question,
does
the
state
of
oklahoma
have
an
interest
in
insulating
major
parties
from
competition
for
members?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
have
a...
the
state
has
an
interest
in
protecting
major
parties
from
losing
their
members
and
thereby
weakening
the
two-party
system
by
benefitting
a
third
party.
i
thought
that's
contrary
to
the
whole
thrust
of
our
holding
in
cases
such
as
anderson
and
celebreeze
where
third
parties
are
entitled
to
special
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
even
in
presidential
elections,
most
people
don't
get
interested
until
4
or
5
weeks
before
the
election.
everybody
knows
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
saying
even
in
a
presidential
primary.
if
they're
local
races,
it...
it
takes
longer.
the
public
just
tunes
out
until
the
last...
last
couple
weeks.
