mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
today
involves
a
conflict
between
oklahoma's
semi-closed
primary
law
and
a
rule
adopted
by
the
libertarian
party
of
oklahoma
which,
contrary
to
that
state
law,
would
allow
the
libertarian
party
to
open
its
primary
elections
not
just
to
independent
voters,
but
also
voters
registered
as
members
of
other
political
parties.
the
oklahoma
primary
system
simply
requires
that
a
person
who
is
registered
as
a
member
of
that
party
may
only
vote
in
that
political
party's
primaries.
if
the
voter
desires
to
vote
in
another
party's
primary,
all
that
voter
must
do
is,
within
a
reasonable
time
before
the
elections,
primary
elections,
approximately
7
to
8
weeks,
is
disaffiliate
from
that
first
party
and
then
reaffiliate
as
a
member
of
that
second
party,
or
if
the
parties
so
chose
to
allow
independents,
he
may
registered
as
an
independent
in
order
to
vote
in
that
primary.
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
practicality
of
that
matter
is...
is
that
generally
the
parties
are
notified
10
days/2
weeks
in
advance
of
the
registration
deadline
that
they
are
being...
if...
being
recognized
as
a
political
party.
of
course...
and
that's
if
that
party
has
waited
until
the
very
last
minute
by
statute
in
which
to
turn
in
their
petitions
and
try
to
get
recognized.
of
course,
those
petitions
could
be
turned
in
earlier,
which
would
allow
them
more
time
to
do
so.
but
the
practicality
of
the...
of--
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
the
oklahoma
statute
requires
that
the
election
board
take
a...
has
30
days,
a
maximum
of
30
days,
in
which
to
review
the
petitions,
verify
the
number
of
signatures
and
the
authenticity
of
those
signatures,
and
then
make
a
decision
on
whether
to
recognize
or
not
recognize
the
political
party.
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the...
the
only
question
that
has
really
been
litigated
below
is
whether
section
1-104,
which
is
the
semi-closed
primary
law,
is
burdensome
on
the
association
rights
of
the
libertarians.
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
not
from
insulating
them
from
competition,
your
honor,
but
the
state
of
oklahoma
does
have...
it
has
a
closed
primary
system.
it
has...
it
has
an
interest.
and
this
court
has
found
that
interest,
as
recently
as
in
timmons,
that
it
does
have
an
interest
in
a
stable
political
system,
which
may
be
a
two-party
system.
as
long
as--
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
since
that
time
in
anderson
and
as
timmons
and
other
cases
cite,
if
the
regulation
is
a
neutral,
nondiscriminatory
regulation,
then
it
is
a
proper
regulation
as
far
as
it
is
applied
to
all
the
parties.
in
regards
to
the
requirement
of
registration,
change
of
voter
registration,
all
of
those
are
applied
equally
across
any...
any
party,
whether
it
be
the
libertarian
party,
the
democratic
party,
republican
party,
or
any
other
party
which
may
be
recognized
at
that
time
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
and
back
to
justice
breyer's
comments,
the
period
of
7
to
8
weeks
prior
to
a
voting...
to
a
primary
election
is
actually
a
very
short
time
as
compared,
for
example,
to
rosario
which
this
court--
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
we...
this
is
not
the
presidential
primaries
of
which
we're
talking
about.
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
well,
the
statutes
in
this...
or
the
sites
or
the...
the
elections
themselves
are
close
in
time,
and...
and
the
statutes
involving
the
petitioning
have
all
been
looked
at
as...
as
courts
and
have
been
found
that
this
is
a
close
enough
connection
to
the
time
of
the
elections,
that
that
time
frame
of
petitioning
and
getting
the
requirements
for...
for
petitions
and
the
state
recognizing
the
political
party
all
fit
comfortably
within
the
confines
of...
of
constitutionality.
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
this
court
can
find...
first
of
all,
that
the
local
democratic
and
republican
parties
were
not
named
in...
in
the
action,
and
as
to
why
they
were
not
in
the
action
in
lower
courts
i
do
not
know.
but
the
state
has
its
interests
and
has
to
protect
those
interests
whether
those
parties
are
involved
in
litigation
or
not.
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
under
monroe
before
this
court,
i
think
the
court
was
looking
to
the
potential,
the
possibility,
of
course.
and
as
to
the
fact
pattern
we
had
at
the
trial
court,
it
was
a
very
minor
party
wanting
to...
or
effectively
poach
voters
from
the
two
major
parties.
but
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
statutory
scheme
and
not
just
how
it
would
apply.
it
could
be
applied
by
the
democrats
or
the
republicans.
but
also
more
importantly,
in
monroe
this
court
clearly
stated
that
a
state
does
not
have
to
wait
until
it
sees
actual
damage
to
its
political
or
electoral
system
to
make
reasonable
decisions.
in
fact,
this
court
says
the
states
should
have
the
foresight
to
make
those
reasonable
determinations
in
an
effort
to
prevent
those...
those
potential
evils
from
occurring
if
the
likelihood
of...
of
that
is
there.
and
the
district
court
made
very--
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
--excuse
me,
justice
scalia.
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
the...
the
fact
that
they're
not
there...
here
the
court--
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
--and
they
do
like
to
keep
their
party
members
as
happy
as
they
can.
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
the...
the
injury
is
twofold,
your
honor.
and...
and
first,
it
is
the
fact
that
by
them
not
voting
in
the
primary
to
which
they
have
associated...
and
that
is
registering
as
a
republican
or
a
democrat...
if
they
go
to
the
polling
place
and
at
the
last
minute
decide
to
go
and
vote
in
the
libertarian
party
primary,
their
decision
not
to
vote
in
the
republican
primaries,
when
candidates
have
been
trying
to...
to
use
voter
lists
trying
to
get
to
their
party
members
to
vote--
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
--well,
if
they
had
already
made
the
decision
to
stay
home,
then
they
would
not
be
voting
for
the
candidate,
but
they
would
also
not
be
voting
in
another
party's
primary.
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
well,
the
party
is
here
because
it
has
the...
the
possibility,
for
those
who
are
not
voting,
of
changing
the
elections
of
the
candidates.
and
i
think
also
by--
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
--well,
because
they
voted
either
way
of
voting...
or
for
voting
in
the
libertarians
and...
and
not
voting,
they
have
changed
and
possibly
have
changed,
especially
when
they
went
to
the--
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
--there...
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
supports
any
of
that.
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
there...
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
there
was
no
type
of
polling.
there
was
some...
some
expert
testimony
as
to
the
potential
reasons
for
people
voting
in
a
libertarian
primary
such
as
purposeful
intent
to
do
harm
to
libertarians
or
walking
in
intending
to
vote--
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
well,
i...
i
think,
your
honor,
there...
there
is
a
context
or...
there
is
belief
that
it
will
harm.
and
there's
been
no
polling
in
this
action,
and
there's
no...
there
was
only
one
other
state
that
has
a
open...
what
we
have
termed
in
this
litigation
as
a...
a
semi-open
primary.
and
there's
no
data
that
has
effectively
come
out
of
their
one
primary
that
says
why
people
are
not
voting,
why
they're
voting
in
one
primary
or
not
or
the
effects
of
that.
i
can
give
you--
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
--and...
and,
your
honor,
we...
we
provided
that
information
and
those
interests
to...
to
the
district
court.
and
those
are
interests
the
state
has.
it
is
if
a
party
is
running
as
a
party
and
if
the
state...
there...
there
may
be
an
interest
in
it.
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
--that...
that
is
the
premise,
of
course,
of
the
voter
registration.
and...
and
that
goes
back
to
another...
an
adverse
effect
on
the
state
and
the
state's
political
system
is
this
court
has
recognized...
it
recognized
it
as
recently
as
jones
and
it
has
recognized
in
other
cases...
that
there
is
a...
a
party
labeling
or
a
party
identification
that
voters
use
in
a
general
election.
and
if
the
poaching
of
members
have
changed
the...
any
of
those
party...
those
messages
from
that
party,
then
the
reliance
is
going
to
be
misplaced
by
those
party
members
when
they
go.
they
go
to
vote
for
a
democrat.
they
see
the
d
or
the
r
or
the
l.
and
more
importantly,
in
this
case
we're
not
talking
just
about
the
libertarian
party,
the
effect
of
the
libertarian
party.
it
could
very
well
the
effects
on
all
of
the
political
parties.
in
fact,
that
effect
could
happen
if
the
democrats
wanted
to
open
theirs
up
and
run
that
effect
on
the
libertarian
party.
another
reason,
especially
that
is
specific
to
oklahoma,
to
help
prevent
party
factionalism
and
party
splintering.
in
oklahoma,
when
a
new
party
is
recognized,
a...
a
potential
candidate
has
the
opportunity
within
15
days
of
the
party
being
recognized
of
changing
his
voter
registration.
that
can
even
be
outside
the
parameters
of
section
4-119.
in
that
instance,
there
is
the
potential
and
i
think
the
probability
of
this
occurring
is
that...
let's
say
there
are
four
or
five
candidates
who
have
announced
for
the
republican
nomination
if
they
want
to
get
their
nomination,
and
one
of
them
decides
i
don't
want
to
compete
against
those
others.
a
new
party
comes
in.
he
is
excused
from
the
6-month
disaffiliation
requirement.
within
those
15
days,
he
can
change
to
the
libertarian
party
in
hopes
of
getting
that
nomination,
get
the
party
support
and
the
party
structure.
by
that
happening,
you
then
incur...
by
allowing
this
party-option
primary,
then
that
would
promote
party
splintering,
party
factionalism.
and
the
manner
of
that
individual
going
to
the
libertarian
party
the
day
of
the
election
without
any
prior
registration...
those
republicans
who
may
have
supported
him
leave
the
republican
party
and
start
to
choose
that.
that's
splintering
that
this
court
has
specifically
said
is
not
only
a
legitimate,
important
state
interest
but
is
also
a
compelling
state
interest
to
effect.
poaching
has
the
same
effect
as
raiding.
it
is
a
little
different
how
it
gets
there,
but
it
has
the
same
effect.
and
raiding
has
been
determined
to
be
even
a
compelling
state
interest
in
this
court.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
wellon
b.
poe,
jr.
i
will
try
and
be
brief,
your
honor.
the
important
thing
to
remember,
in
regards
to
most
of
respondents'
argument
today
and
in
their
brief,
is
that
the
events
and
the
hurdles
they
are
challenging
now
were...
have
never
been
raised
at
any
time
prior
to
this
briefing
and
this
hearing.
the
district
court
did
not
make
findings
as
to
the
difficulty
of
the
ballot
access
or
the
ballot
qualifications.
he
merely
set
forth
what
those
were.
the
tenth
circuit
never
even
addressed
anything
in
regards
to
ballot
access
or
ballot
qualifications
and
in
relation
to
the
need
to
open
up
a
primary.
and
in
the
complaint,
at
the
joint
appendix
page
22,
the
specific
relief
sought
by
the
respondents
is
to
have
section
1-104,
which
is
the
semi-closed
primary
section...
have
it
declared
unconstitutional.
there's
no
mention
of
any
other
relief
sought.
no
other
section,
the
election
primary
scheme,
or
anything
else
mentioned
in
their
complaint.
it's
never
been
raised
before
and
it's
never
been
addressed
by
any
court
and...
and
should
not
be
addressed
by
this
court
at
this
point
in
time.
there
are
no
findings
for
this
court
to
rely
on
to
review
the
allegations
that
have
been
made
today.
where
the
district
court...
or
where
the
tenth
circuit
did
err
specifically
is
they
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
as
a
matter
of
law,
based
on
jones
and
tashjian,
that
any
infringement
upon
a
party's
ability
to
associate
is
a
compelling...
must...
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
and
requires
a
compelling
state
interest.
jones
specifically
says
that
is
not
the
case.
tashjian
implies
that
that
is
not
the
case.
and
the
cases
since
tashjian's
time
say
a
compelling
state
interest
is
not
always
the
appropriate
test.
you
look
to
the
injury
and
then
you
look
to
the
burdens.
in
this
case,
the
appropriate
burden...
or
the
appropriate
injury
is
not
severe.
they
are
reasonable
restrictions
placed
on
oklahoma
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
its
political
system
and
its
election
system.
with
that,
the
restrictions
on...
in
the
oklahoma
statutes
are
reasonable
restrictions
that
govern
and
control
and
support
important
state
interests.
for
that
reason,
the
tenth
circuit
was
incorrect.
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
analysis,
and
we
would
ask
that
this
court
reverse
that
decision
and
find
that
those
statutes
are
constitutional.
thank
you.
