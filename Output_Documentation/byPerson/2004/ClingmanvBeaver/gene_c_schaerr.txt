mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
decision
below,
the
tenth
circuit
stuck...
struck
down
an
election
rule
that
has
been
adopted
by
nearly
half
the
states
pursuant
to
their
authority
under
article
i,
section
4
to
prescribe
the
manner
of
holding
elections.
in
so
doing,
the
tenth
circuit
in
our
view
made
three
fundamental
errors
that
i'd
like
to
address
briefly.
the
first
was
the
tenth
circuit's
per
se
approach
to
determining
whether
the
alleged
burdens
here
are
severe.
that's
an
extremely
important
issue,
of
course,
because
to
our
knowledge,
this
court
has
never
invalidated
a
state
election
regulation
under
the
first
amendment
without
first
finding
that
the
burden
at
issue
was
severe.
but
instead
of
looking
at
that
issue
closely,
the
tenth
circuit,
at
page
15
of
its
decision,
simply
assumed
that
a
severe
burden
necessarily
arises
from
any
regulation
that,
quote,
restricts
the
options
of
parties
seeking
to
define
the
scope
of
their
associational
rights.
now,
one
would
have
thought
that
it's
for
courts
to
determine
the
scope
of
a...
of
a
party's
associational
rights
rather
than...
than
the
party
itself.
but
in
all
events,
that
was
the
sum
total
of
the
tenth
circuit's
analysis
on
the...
on
the
question
of
severe
burden.
now,
the
respondents
cite
that
finding,
but
they...
they
make
no
attempt
to
defend
that
approach.
they
argue
instead
that
the
burden
here
is
severe
because,
at
bottom,
oklahoma
requires
a
republican
or
democrat,
wishing
to
vote
in
the
lpo
primary,
to...
to
disaffiliate
from
the
party
2
months
in
advance.
but
that
burden
is
no
more
severe
than
others
that
this
court
has
found
constitutionally
acceptable.
the
burden
on
voters,
for
example,
is
less
severe
than
the
burden
this
found...
this
court
found
acceptable
in
rosario,
which
was
a...
a
requirement,
as
mr.
poe
mentioned,
that
voters,
wishing
to
vote
in
a...
in
a
party's
primary,
register
as
a
member
of
that
party
some
8
to
11
months
in
advance.
the
burden
on
the
party
is
also
less
severe
than
a
burden
that
this
court
found
acceptable
in
burdick
which
is
that
a
party
wishing
to
qualify
for
a
primary
ballot
gather
the
necessary
signatures,
in
that
case
1
percent
of
the
voting
population,
5
months
before
the
primary.
it's
2
months
here.
and
it's
also
similar
to
a
burden
that
all
the
members
of
this
court
found
acceptable
in
burdick,
which
was...
which
was
a
requirement
that
a
candidate
wishing
to
run
on
a
nonpartisan
primary
ballot
collect
the
necessary
signatures
about
2
months
before
the
primary.
and
the
message
of
these
decisions...
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
the
holding
in
burdick...
is
that
requiring
participants
in
elections
to
take
action
a
few
months
sooner
or
a
few
weeks
sooner
than
they
might
prefer
does
not
amount
to
a
severe
burden.
and
that's
the
only
real
burden
here.
the
lpo
has
to--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--justice
o'connor,
i...
i
think
that's
really
up
to
the
party.
and
i...
and
i
think
that
gets
back
to
my
point
about
burdick.
yes,
there
is
a
deadline
and
if
the
lpo--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--yes,
i...
i
think
that's
true,
but
again,
the
burden
on
the
voter
depends
on
what
the
lpo
does.
if
the
lpo
marshals
its
resources,
gets...
gets
its
message
out,
determines
who
its
candidates
are
going
to
be
or
who
its
potential
candidates
are
going
to
be
in
advance
of
the
filing
deadline
and
in
advance
of
the
deadline
for
filing
a
petition
to
become
a
recognized
party,
then
the
voter
will
have
ample
time
to
make
a
decision.
it's
really
only
if
the
lpo
procrastinates
that
the
voter
is
put
in
that
position.
it's
not
really
a
function
of
the...
of
the
state
law.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
i
think...
i
think
the
state's
interest
is
what
the
district
court
found
it
to
be,
and
i
think
the...
the
district
court
actually
found
two
interests,
not
just
one.
it
found
an
interest
in
avoiding
poaching
and
an
interest
in
promoting
party
loyalty
along
the
lines
that
justice
scalia
mentioned
earlier.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i
do.
and
in
fact,
the...
the
district
court
at...
at
page
49--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--yes.
we...
we
do
have
an
answer
to
that.
that
is
implicit,
first
of
all,
in
the
district
court's
finding
that
poaching
would,
in
fact,
made...
make
a
difference
in
the...
in
the
outcomes
of
the
elections.
he...
he
made
that
finding
very
clearly
on...
on
page
49--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--that
is
implicit
in
his
finding.
he
said
the
institution...
this
is
again
on
page
49.
the
institution
of
a
party-option
open
primary
format
in
oklahoma,
as
sought
by
the
plaintiffs,
would
likely
affect
the
outcome
of
some
primary
elections.
that...
implicit
in
that
is
the
view
that
there...
there
would
be
some
voting
republicans
and
voting
democrats
that
would
be
moving
to
the
lpo,
not
just
the
nonvoting
democrats
and
republicans.
now--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--yes.
mr.
darcy's
testimony,
which
i
believe
appears
at...
at
page
63
of
the
joint
appendix,
in
that...
in
that
general
area,
anyway.
now,
poaching...
poaching
is
a
concern
and...
and
a
legitimate
and
important
concern
to
the
states
for
three
important
reasons.
i...
i
might
mention
that
in
tashjian
this
court
mentioned
in
footnote
13
that
a...
that
an
open
primary
could
have
disorganization
effects
on
the
other
parties,
and
poaching
is
one
of
those,
as
the
district
court
found.
and...
and
it's
a
concern
for
three
independent
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
preventing
poaching
because
that
helps
protect
parties
from
spurned
candidate
candidacies
which
was
one
of
the...
the
court
in
tashjian
identified
storer
and
rosario
as
examples
of
that.
and...
and
the...
the
semi-closed
primary
protects
parties
against
that.
for
example,
if
a
candidate
for
the
democratic
nomination
felt
that
she
wasn't
getting
enough
support
from
the
party
leadership
before
the
primary,
she
might
form
or
join
another
party
and
then
try
to
take...
take
her
supporters
with
her
into
that
other
party.
and
although
oklahoma
allows
the
candidate
to
switch
parties
in
that
circumstance,
the...
the
semi-closed
primary
and
the
7-week
period
or
7
or
8-week
period,
standoff
period,
if
you
will...
that
period
protects
the
party
from
having
its
voters
poached
as
a
result
of
a...
of
a
spurned
candidate
joining
another
party.
the
second
reason
that
poaching
is
a
significant
concern
is
that...
is
that
it
can
lead
to
efforts,
strategic
efforts
by...
by
other
parties
to
influence
the
outcome
of
another
party's
primary.
for
example,
suppose
we're
in
california
in
2002
a
few
days
before
the
gubernatorial
primaries
there.
the
democrats
have
already
decided
that
their
incumbent,
governor
davis,
will
be
nominated,
so
they're
looking
ahead
to
the
general
election.
and
they
see
two
possible
republican
candidates,
reardon
and
simon,
to
pull
two
names
out
of
a
hat.
and
they
conclude
that...
that
they
have
a
better
chance
of
beating
simon
than
they
have
of
beating
reardon.
well,
what
can
they
do
to
affect
the...
the
outcome
of
the
republican
race?
one
possibility,
if
the
republican
primary
is
open,
is
to
raid
it
by
having
some
democrat
switch
registration
and
go
vote
for
simon.
and
of
course,
the
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
states
have
an
important
interest
in...
in
preventing
that
kind
of
behavior.
the
other
possibility
is
for
the--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--that's
correct.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
that's
correct.
and
the
other
possibility,
though,
is
for
the
democrats
to
open
their
primary
and
to
lure
some
of
the...
some
of
the
reardon
voters
out
of
the
republican
primary
through
targeted
advertising
or
direct
appeals
from
the
candidate
or
something
like
that.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
but...
but
it
is...
but
it
is
a
plausible
concern
that
a
legislature
would
have.
and
as
justice
scalia
said,
these--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--well,
there...
there's
another
scenario
for...
in
the
california
example,
for
example.
take...
assume
that
the
democrats,
instead
of
opening
up
their
own
primary
to
republicans,
they
strike
a
deal
with
the
green
party
such
that
the
green
party
makes
an
effort
to
peel
off
the
reardon
voters
out
of
the
republican
primary
voting
pool
in
california.
that--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--it
depends
on
how
they
ran...
ran
the
campaign.
in
all
events,
it's
a...
it's
a
plausible
scenario
and...
and
one
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
respond
to
before
it...
before
it
actually
happens.
now,
the...
the
third
reason
that
poaching
is
a
problem
is
that--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--thank
you.
