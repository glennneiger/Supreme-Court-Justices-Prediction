we'll
now
hear
argument
in
clingman
against
beaver.
mr.
poe,
as
soon
as
you're
ready,
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
poe,
may
i
just
focus
in
on
exactly
what
the
injury
is?
is
the
injury
that
they
vote
with
the
libertarians
or
that
they
don't
vote
with
their
own
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wouldn't
it
be
precisely
the
same
injury
if
they
just
didn't
like
the
republican
candidate
in
that
particular
election,
decided
to
stay
home?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how...
how
are
they
hurt
by
the
fact
that
rather
than
staying
home,
they
decide
to
cast
a
vote
for
a
minority
party
candidate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
very
unlikely
if
it's
a
party
that
is...
gets
the
small
vote
that
this
party
gets.
but
you...
no
matter
how
small
the
vote
is,
you
still
find
the
injury
to
the
major
parties
because
they
voted
for
the
libertarians
or
because
they
didn't
vote
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
evidence
on
the
question
whether
the...
the
support
for
the
major
party
candidate
is
any
smaller
than
it
would
have
been
if
there
had
been
no
libertarian
party
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
fine.
mr.
schaerr.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
not
permitted
in
oklahoma,
is
it?
that
kind
of
behavior
is
not
permitted
in
oklahoma.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
neither
of
the
major
parties
has
done
that
in
oklahoma,
has
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
question
is
whether
when
a
minor
party
like
the
libertarians
do
it,
is...
is
it
going
to
have
that
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
cost
of
that
deal
would...
they'd
also
run
the
risk
the
democrats
would...
would
migrate
also
if
they
made
that
deal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
apologize
for
taking
your
time
with
a
question,
but
i'm
afraid
your
time
is
up.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
mr.
linger.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
linger.
mr.
poe,
you
have
about
3
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
poe.
the
case
is
submitted.
