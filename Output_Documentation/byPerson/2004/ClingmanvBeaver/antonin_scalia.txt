if
they're
turned
in
earlier,
will
they...
will
they
be
ruled
on
earlier?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
poe,
i...
i
suppose...
here
i
am.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
if...
if
i
were
the
party
chairman
of
the
republican
or
democratic
party,
i'm...
i
might
have
defended
your...
your
state
system
if
i
had
been
named
as
a
party,
but
if
i
were
not
named
as
a
party,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
wouldn't...
i
wouldn't
decline
to
come
in
as
an
amicus,
even
though
i'm
interested
in
the
outcome
simply
because
i
don't
want
to
alienate
my
republican
members
by
depriving
them
of
the
freedom,
if
they
want
to
do
it,
to
go
vote.
you
know,
it
makes
you
look
sort
of
parsimonious,
doesn't
it,
when
you
tell
your
republican
members,
i
don't
want
you
to
vote
in
the
libertarian
primaries?
i...
i
don't
think
we
can
say
that
it
doesn't
hurt
the
republican
party
or
the...
or
the
democratic
party
simply
because
they
hadn't
filed
an
amicus
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are,
after
all,
politicians,
aren't
they?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
poe,
i...
i...
why
do
you
rely
only
upon
the
damage
to
the
republican
and
democratic
parties?
i
frankly
don't
care
much
about
that,
but
i
might
care
a
whole
lot
about
damage
to...
to
oklahoma's
system
of
election.
why
do
you
allow
party
designations?
i
suppose
it
is
because
you
want
people
to
know
that
there
are
candidates
who
are
associated
with
particular
political
views.
and
to
allow
a
party
to,
in
effect,
come
in
and
say,
we
don't
have
any
particular
political
views,
we...
we
just
want
to
nominate,
you
know,
whoever
the
most
people
want
to
nominate,
that
just
destroys
the
whole
purpose
of...
of
your
system
of
allowing
people
to
run
under
a
party
label.
what's
the
use
of
a
party
label?
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
if
it's
running
as
a
party,
it
should
run
somebody
who...
who
shares
the
views
of
the
people
in
that
party,
which
is
somebody
who
is
nominated
by...
by
the
people
in
that
party,
or
at
least
those
people,
joined
by
others
who
are
not
affiliated
with
another
party.
that
seems
to
me
to
make
a
lot
of
sense.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
destroy
that
system
if...
if
you
say,
hey,
we're...
you
know,
we...
we're
going
to
allow
the
libertarian
party
to
say,
you
know,
we
don't
have
any
real
views.
we're
just
going
to...
we
want
to
nominate
somebody
that
most
people
like.
so
let
the
republicans
come
in,
the
democrats
come
in.
the
only
thing
we
want
is
to
win.
we
don't
really
care.
justice
antonin
scalia
the...
the
state...
the
state
of
oklahoma
doesn't
want
your
party
raided.
and...
and
you
say
we
don't
care
if
we're
raided.
come
raid
us.
all
we
want
to
do
is
win.
it
seems
to
me
it...
it...
you
cannot
apply
the...
the
maxim,
volenti
non
fit
injuria.
oklahoma
is
saying
to
your
party,
you
can't
welcome
raiding.
we
don't
want
your
party
to
be
raided
whether
you
like
it
or
not
because
that's
what
a
party
system
is.
we've
set
up
these
elections
that...
that
have
party
primaries
and
party
systems
on
the
assumption
that
each
party
is
going
to
have
a
certain...
a
certain
belief,
a
certain
philosophy,
and
to
allow
your
candidate
to
be
elected
by
everybody
simply
destroys
that
system.
why
is
that...
why
is
that
so
unreasonable
that
it's
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
weren't
those--
justice
antonin
scalia
--weren't
those
who
would
like
to
nominate
the
libertarian
candidate
who
would
attract
the
most
people
from
the
other
large
party?
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but...
but
the
candidate
mostly
to
attract
people
from
one
of
the
major
parties
is
the
candidate
that
is...
is
more
likely
to
water
down
the
pure
libertarian
message
and
be
closer
to
the
message
of
the
democratic
party
or
the
republican
party.
and...
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--people
who
come
into
your
primary
may
want
to
elect
such
a
candidate
so
that
the
libertarian
party
will
be
strengthened
and
draw
votes
away
from
the
other
majority--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
facts?
we...
we
have
to
evaluate
it
on
the
basis
of
each
election?
what
is
a
state
legislator
supposed
to
do
when
he
votes
for
a...
an
election
system?
he's
going
to
flip
a
coin
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
fact
situation
will
be
when
this...
when
this
system
finally
gets
before
a
court?
surely
that...
that
can't
be
the
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
same
as
election
system...
that's
the
same
as
alaska's
system.
right?
i
mean,
it
boils
down
to
the
same
thing.
it
boils
down
to
an
open
primary,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
last
category
could...
could
register
as
independents.
i
mean,
if
they're
ashamed
of...
of
the
l
word,
they...
they
could
just
register
as
independents.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did...
what
did
you
seek
in
this
action?
what
did
you
seek
in
this
action?
did...
did
you
seek
just
more
time
to...
to
register?
i...
i
thought
you...
you
sought
to
overturn
the...
the
system
entirely
and...
i
mean,
maybe
you
asked
for
too
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
more...
more
time
might
be...
might
be
a
good
idea,
but
that
wouldn't
satisfy
your...
your
complaint
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
your...
your
complaint
is
no
matter
how
much
time
you're
given--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
are
the
mici
states?
you
said
this
a
couple...
what
are
mici
states?
mici
states
did
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
i
thought
you
were
saying
mici.
