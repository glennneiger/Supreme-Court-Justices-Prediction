justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
a
very
similar
question.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
those
who
would
vote
in
the
libertarian
primary
are
the
stay-at-home
republicans
or
the
republicans
who
would
otherwise
have
voted
in
the
republican
primary?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that...
i
mean,
the
libertarians
are
happy
to
have...
take
that
risk.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
me
if
we
don't
know
whether
the...
the
republicans
who
are
going
to
migrate
to
the
primary
are
stay-at-homes
or
republican
voters,
the
state
has
no
basis
even
to
say
whether
in
fact
the
harm
it's
trying
to
prevent
is
going
to
be
affected
one
way
or
the
other
by
its
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
just
ask
you
to
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
equation.
however
we
assess
the
burden,
we're
assessing
it
in
relation
to
the
state's
interest.
what
is
your
best
statement
of
the
state's
interest
here
that
you
think
is
defensible?
justice
david
h.
souter
do...
do
you
think
the...
the
poaching
argument
stands
up
on
any...
any
empirical
basis?
justice
david
h.
souter
may...
let
me
just
add
quickly.
i...
i
realize,
of
course,
there's
going
to
be
some
movement
of
voters,
but
do
we
have
any
idea
whether
the
voters
who
are
moving
are
the
ones
who
would
otherwise
have
stayed
at
home
anyway
and
done
nothing,
merely
nominal
republicans
as
opposed
to
active
republicans?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
found
that
the
numbers
are
such
that
they
could,
but
did
he
find...
and
i'm
not
sure
of
this.
did
he
find
that
the
actual
people
who
migrated
would
otherwise
have
voted
differently
so
that
in
fact
it
made
a
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
you...
you
want
them
to
think
and
you
want
to
leave
the
door
open
to
their
making
a
distinction
for
these
purposes
between
the
major
parties
and
the
minor
parties,
and
i
can't
think
of
anything
more
intrusive
into
the
political
process
than
that.
coming
from
a
libertarian,
i...
i
get
a
sense
that
i
must
misunderstand
you,
but
i
don't
know
where
it
is.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
we
are...
we
have
got
to
look
around
the
corner.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
if
you're
issuing
the
invitation
to
come
up
with
a
different
rule
for
republicans
and
democrats
and
libertarians,
i
think
you're
asking
for
trouble
and
we
would
be
asking
for
trouble
if
we
accepted
that
invitation.
