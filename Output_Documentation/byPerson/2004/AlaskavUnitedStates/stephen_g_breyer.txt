justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
you
say
explicit?
i...
i
thought
it
said
you
have
to
make
it
plain,
which
really
might
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
it
says...
the
language
i
think
is...
or
definitely
declared
or
otherwise
made
very
plain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
there's
nothing
that
says
explicit.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i'm
correct,
then...
if
i'm
correct,
then
i
guess
the
main
argument
i
thought
is
here
we
have
a
national
park
and
we
want
to
keep
the
national
parks
as
the
united
states,
which
you'd
expect.
it's
a
national
park.
and
of
course,
they
want
to
keep
the
whole
thing.
i
mean,
it's
obvious.
you
don't
have
to
write
everything
that's
obvious.
they
no
more
want
to
give
all
the
water
in
the
park
to
alaska
than
they'd
want
to
give
the
gamekeeper's
part
to
alaska.
a
house,
or
maybe
there's
a
swimming
pool
somewhere
they
don't
mention
either,
but
it's
just
obvious
that
unless
there's
something
very
special
about
the
water,
that
the
water
in
the
park
is
part
of
the
park.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that.
but
i
mean,
it's
like
saying
we're
keeping
yellowstone,
but
we're
giving
you
the
geysers.
i
mean,
that's
water
too.
it's
even
underground
water.
but
i
mean,
what
the
argument
i
think
is...
would
be
is
this
like
that,
and
the
argument
that
it
is
like
that
is
that,
well,
of
course,
you
need
this
water
in
order
to
study
the
glaciers
because
there
are
forests
that
go
down
to
the
edge,
because
the
flora
and
fauna
can't
be
protected
without
it.
and
so
though
it
isn't
as
strong
a
case
as
the
geysers
in
yellowstone,
it's
good
enough.
now,
what's
your
reply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that.
i'm
using
a
funny
example
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--like
in
yellowstone.
there
is
a
river
i
think.
who
owns
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
but
i
mean,
does
the
state
or
the
feds
own
the...
the
river
that
goes
through
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
in
yosemite?
i
think
there's
a
river
down
there
too.
is
the
river
in
yosemite
owned
by
california
or
by
the...
the
feds?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
but
normally
you
assume,
i
guess,
that
congress
does
what
is...
tries
to
avoid
things
that
are
ridiculous.
so
if
they
say
keep
the
park,
i
guess
the
question
would
be
is
that
included.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
you
read
it
this
way?
i...
i
think
it
would
be
relevant,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in...
in
respect
to
glacier
bay--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i...
i
mean,
is
the
only...
you
said,
for
example...
is
the
only
dispute
about
the
use
of
the
water
that's
in
the
middle
of
the
glacier
bay
park
whether
there
should
be
more
or
less
fishing,
or
are
there
other
things
that
alaska
wants
to
do
with
that
water
in
the
park
that
they
can't
do
if
the
united
states
owns
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
they
do
that?
you
mean
they
would
go
into
a
boat
in
the
middle
of
the
water
there,
but
they
couldn't
get
off
the
boat?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
all
right.
so
if...
if
the
normal
way
of
visiting
the
park
is
to
go
into
a
boat
and
to
go
up
along
the
waterway
and
to
look
at
the
glaciers
on
the
shore,
then
it
surely
is
odd
that
the
united
states
intended
to
give
that
waterway
to
alaska,
for
under
those
circumstances,
there
would
be
nothing
left
of
the
park.
i
mean,
it
would
be
like...
you
see,
if
it's
essential
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
understand
that,
but
i
mean,
it's
the
way
of
visiting
the
park.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
where
is
the
language
that
says
that
the
submerged
land
that
fits
the
proviso
is
retained
by
the
united
states?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
the
proviso
says
is
just
what
justice
scalia
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
where
is
the
implication
in
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
that's...
it...
i
mean,
in...
in...
i
take
it
in
the
alaska
case
we
were
considering
a
transfer
that
did
fall
within
the
main
sentence
of
(e).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
were
we
or
weren't
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
weren't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
then
at
best
alaska
is
a
neutral.
because
we
didn't
think
it,
we're
operating
as
a
mistake.
it's
a
neutral.
okay.
now,
what's
bothering
me
about
the
case
is
just
what
justice
scalia
said,
that...
that
why
i...
if
i
sell
you
all
my
clothing
and
then
i
put,
but
not
my
camping
gear,
i
mean,
i
can
absolutely
see
you
don't
get
my
camping
clothing,
but
you
want
to
say
that's
a
reservation
of
mess
kits
from
some
other
transfer?
i
mean,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
mess
kits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
and
then
it
doesn't
go
in
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
next--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
it's
an
abundance
of
caution,
where's
the
other
language
that
almost
reserves
it
so
we
need
the
caution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
5
is
subject
to
the
submerged
lands
act
and
the
submerged
lands
act
brings
you
back
to
the
reservation
has
to
be
explicit.
and
then...
see,
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
why
i
was
talking
about
yellowstone.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
looking
for
something
that
would
be
obvious
that
they
wouldn't
have
meant
to
transfer.
he
comes
back
and
says,
well,
very
often
states
do
control
the
water.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
thought--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
given
what
you're
saying...
and
i...
you're
not
accepting
this
i
think,
and
i...
well,
there
is
language
in
this
act
which
maintains
in
the
united
states
title
to
the
park.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
i
would
have
thought
when
you
get
title
to
the
park,
you
mean
the
park,
and
by
the
park,
you
mean
those
essential
parts
of
the
park.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore,
if
you
have
a
part
of
the
park
which
is
the
only
part
of
the
park
where
people
look
at
the
park,
and
it's
the
only
part
of
the
park
that
brings
them
into
the
park,
and
it's
the
only
part
of
the
park
where
you
do
the
research,
et
cetera,
that's
the
park.
just
as
if
i
were
to
sell
my
house
and
i
list
the
rooms
and
forget
the
kitchen,
well,
the
kitchen
is
an
essential
part
of
the
house.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now...
now,
once
i
made
that
argument,
he
said
that's
a
very
clever
argument,
but
really,
there
are
all
kinds
of
instances
where
states
have
reserved
submerged
land
inside
national
parks
and
it's
worked
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
response
to
all
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should.
now,
you're
not...
how
far
are
you
prepared
to
go?
you
can't
go
more
than
your
brief
and
your
facts
justify.
are
you
prepared
to
say
that
this
water
is
an
essential
part
of
the
park?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
said
that
before
this
minute?
