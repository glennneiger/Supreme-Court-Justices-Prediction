justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
that
simply
mean
that
if
it
explicitly
recognizes,
it
has
made
it
plain.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
must
be
explicit
in
every
case.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
have
to
be
explicit
to
make
it
plain.
it's
a
great
way
to
do
it,
but
that's...
it's
not
the
only
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
could...
could
you
be
concrete?
i
mean,
there...
i
don't
know
what
you
mean.
what
are
the
issues?
can
you
give
me
an
explicit
example?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the...
the
assertion
of
authority
to
regulate
fishing
really
is...
is
relevant.
it
has
no
necessary
implication
for
the
historic
waters
doctrine.
what...
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
page
was
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
minear,
may
i
ask
you?
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
was
the
national
government
conducting
these
activities?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
you
were
monitoring
passages
through
to
see
whether
the
whales
were
going
to
be
interfered
with
and
doing
that
sort
of
thing.
were
you
taking
core
samples?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
in...
in
other
words,
you...
you're
saying
it
is
fair
to
say
that
at
the
time
of
the
passage,
this
would
have
been
on
the
congressional
mind,
going
back
to
justice
breyer's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--alaska
is
arguing,
as
i
understand
it
now,
that
the...
the
exclusion
for
purposes
of
fisheries
regulation
has
the
same
implication
as
a
matter
of
international
law,
which
is
a
point
that
you
disagree
on.
what...
what
is
your
response
to
their
response
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
what's...
what's
your
best
authority
for
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
the
argument
is
that
it
is
clear
because
the
reservation
without
the
reservation
of
the
waters
would
be
crazy.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't...
i
mean,
what's...
what's
the
answer?
