well,
counsel,
you...
apparently
you
agree
that
the
u.s.
retained
title
to
the
uplands
in
glacier
bay
national
monument
under
section
5--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
the
statehood
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
was
federal
title
to
the
monument
not
sufficient
to
retain
title
to
the
submerged
lands
as
well
without
reference
to
section
6(e)
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why...
why
shouldn't
we
look
to
the
tests
set
out
in
the
idaho
case
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
whether
congress
has
notice
of
the
inclusion
of
the
lands
and
a
federal
reservation,
which
it
certainly
did
for
glacier,
did
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
second,
whether
the
transfer
to
the
state
would
undermine
the
purpose
of
that
reservation.
should
we
look
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
just
as
a
practical
matter,
tell
us
what
you're
arguing
about.
what
does
alaska
think
it
can
do
if
it
prevails
in
the
glacier
monument
area
by
virtue
of
prevailing,
as
a
practical
matter?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
state
would
permit
more
fishing
than
the
u.s.
would
allow--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
a
practical
matter.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there...
there
are
big
differences
between
the...
the
analysis
concerning
the
bays
that
you
assert
and
glacier
monument.
i
think
they're
quite
different.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you're
lumping
them
all
together,
but
i
think
the
tests
are
quite
different.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
minear,
what
do
you
say
are
the
practical
consequences
from
the
federal
government's
perspective
of
going...
of
disagreeing
with
the
u.s.
position?
what
harm
is
done?
can
the
u.s.
protect
itself
in
any
event
under
other
clauses?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
minear,
could
i
go
back
to
glacier--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--park
again
for
a
moment
and
ask
why
the
government
decided
to
base
its
claim
to
the
lands
in
glacier
bay
exclusively
on
that
murky
provision
of
6(e)
rather
than
to
talk
about
the
standards
set
out
in
the
idaho
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you...
do
you
not
rely
on
that
standard--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--analysis?
