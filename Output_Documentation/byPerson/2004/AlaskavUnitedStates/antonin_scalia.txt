justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
do
that,
mr.
franklin,
is...
is
the
rule
that...
that
we're
operating
under
that
congress
had
to
have
made
it
clear--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
it
reserved,
or
is
the
rule
that
it
is
clear
that
congress
ought
to
have
reserved
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
former.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
mere
fact
that
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
not
to
have
reserved
it
does
not
make
it
clear
that
congress
reserved
it,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
franklin,
are...
are
these
submerged
lands
covered
by
navigable
waters?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
it
that
the
government
could
do,
if
they
owned
the
submerged
lands,
by
way
of
protecting
wildlife
and
doing
all
the
good
stuff
they
want
to
do,
that
they
cannot
do
simply
by...
by
reason
of...
of
having
jurisdiction
over
the
navigable
waters?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
couldn't
congress
forbid
that
under...
by
reason
of
its
control
of
the
navigable
waters--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
really
wanted
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we
had
left
that
open.
i
thought
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on...
on
this
point,
it
seems
to
me
there...
unlike
the
first
point
you
were
discussing
where
i
think
the
federal
government
can
work
its
will
anyway,
on
this
point
there
is
really
a
significant
federal
interest
involved.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
united
states
takes
the
position
that
these
are,
indeed,
inland
waters,
it's
going
to
have
to
acknowledge
similar
rights
in
foreign
countries
with
similar
archipelagos.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but...
but
you
say
a
determinative
fact,
a
conclusive
fact
is
simply...
is
simply
enforcing
discriminatory
fishing
regulations.
justice
antonin
scalia
could...
before
you
go
into
that,
could
you
tell
me
how
6(e)
begins?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
(e)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
the...
well...
well,
the...
the
introduction
to
it
is...
is
not
listed,
is
it?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
it's
incomplete.
it...
it
just
says
all
real
and...
what
about
all
real
and
personal
property?
is
there
an
intro
that
says
there
is
hereby...
there
is
hereby
granted
to
the
united...
to
alaska?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
they're
exceptions.
how...
how
are
the
exceptions
introduced?
i
mean,
it's
incomplete
to
just
read
(e)
that
says
all...
what
about
all
real
and
personal
property
of
the
united
states?
there
has
to
be
some
introductory
language.
what
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
you're
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
to...
to
alaska.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
didn't
have
this
issue
before
us.
let...
let
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let
me...
why
don't
you
go
back
to
your
argument?
you
said
that
the
first
proviso
on
its
face
is
simply
not
a
subset
of
the
first
part
of
(e).
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
the
proviso
at
issue
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
proviso
at
issue
here
is
the
second
proviso
which
begins
provided
that
such
transfer
shall
not
include
lands.
such
transfer.
now,
this
is...
the
word
such
refers
you
back
to
something.
what...
what
possible
transfer
could
it
mean
except
the
end
of
the
introduction,
which
says
shall
be
transferred
and
conveyed
to
the
state
of
alaska?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
anybody
reading
that
would...
would
think
that
proviso
refers
to
that
transfer
or
at
least
it
is
not
clear
that
it
provides
to...
that
it
applies
to
every
transfer
in...
in
the
whole
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
such
refer
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
minear,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
you
that...
that
that
language,
facilities
used
in
connection
with
general
research
activities
relating
to
fisheries
or
wildlife,
is
not
a
subpart
of
the
earlier...
of
the
earlier
grant,
namely
property
used
for
the
sole
purpose
of
conservation
and
protection
of
fisheries
and
wildlife.
surely
one...
one
can
readily
regard
general
research
activities
relating
to
fisheries
or
wildlife
to
be
part
of
the
activity
of
conserving
and
protecting
fisheries
and
wildlife.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
minear,
you
know,
i...
i
am
just
overwhelmed
by
the
reality
that
this
is
a
terrible
mess
of
a
statute.
i
can't
figure
out
what
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
exactly
why
we
have
a
clear
statement
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
arguments
here,
there
are
arguments
there,
but
it...
it
does
not
dawn
upon
me
that...
that
anything
is
clear
about
this
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
do
that
on...
on
dry
land
in
some
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
your
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
or
under...
under...
over
navigable
waters
allow
you
to
do
that
kind
of
stuff?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
likely
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
likely
to
do
that?
is
this
a
real
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
hasn't
resulted
in
a...
in
a
disaster.
that's
the
point
that
justice
breyer
is
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
not
resulted
in
a
disaster.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
they
keep
the
other
80
percent
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
they
keep
the
other
80
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
gather
only
20
percent
of
it
is
water.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
make
sure
they're
giving
away
the
rest.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
make
it
a
water
park.
i
mean,
you
want
to
say
it's
a...
it's
a
water-accessible
park,
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
20
percent
of
the
park
is
under
water.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
would...
would
you
respond
to
the...
to
the
argument
that
the
alaska
arctic
coast
case
decided
that
the
proviso
goes
beyond
subsection
(e)?
