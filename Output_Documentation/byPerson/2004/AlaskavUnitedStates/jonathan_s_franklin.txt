mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
title
to
lands
underlying
navigable
waters
is
an
inseparable
attribute
of
state
sovereignty,
this
court
has
long
held
that
there
is
a
strong
presumption
that
each
state
receives
title
to
such
lands
at
statehood.
under
the
court's
precedents,
the
united
states
cannot
defeat
the
state's
title
unless
congress
has
definitely
declared
an
intention
to
do
so
or
has
otherwise
made
that
intention
very
plain.
turning
to
the
glacier
bay
claim
in
this
case,
the
united
states
asserts
that
it
received
title
to
the
submerged
lands
underlying
the
bay
at
statehood,
but
there
is
no
express
statement,
an
unambiguous
statement
by
congress
evidencing
an
intent
to
defeat
alaska's
title.
to
the
contrary,
the
proviso
to
section
6(e)
of
the
alaska
statehood
act,
which
is
the
only
statute
the
united
states
identifies
as
ratifying
the
purported
reservation
of
the
bay,
in
fact
shows
that
title
remains
with
alaska.
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
the
proviso
applies
only
to
a
subset
of
the
lands
that
would
otherwise
have
been
transferred
to
the
state
under
the
main
clause.
and
this
is
important.
in
this
case
it
is
undisputed
by
both
of
the
parties
and
by
the
special
master
that
the
glacier
bay
monument
was
not
included
within
the
main
clause.
the
submerged
lands,
therefore,
did
not--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
absolutely.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
because
of
section
6(m),
your
honor.
section
5
of
the
alaska
statehood
act
provides
that
the
federal
government
retained
all
of
the
property
it
previously
possessed
with
one
important
exception,
except
as
provided
in
section
6.
section
6
has
two
exceptions
within
it
that
are
potentially
relevant
here.
section
6(m)
incorporates
the
submerged
lands
act
and
thereby
provides
that
alaska
was
to
receive
title
to
all
the
submerged
lands
underlying
its
navigable
waters,
plus
those
3
miles
seaward
from
the
coastline,
in
order
to
put
alaska
on
the
same
equal
footing
with
the
rest
of
the
states.
section
6(e)
dealt
with
an
entirely
different
set
of
properties.
what
section
6(e)
did
was
to
transfer
to
the
state
a
very
specific
and
narrowly
defined
class
of
property,
property
that
was
used
for
the
purposes
or
solely...
for
the
sole
purpose
of...
of
fish
and
wildlife
conservation
under
three
designated
statutes.
those
are
the
state...
local-state
fish
and
wildlife
conservation
statutes.
again,
here
it
was...
it
is
undisputed
that
glacier
bay
is
not
included
within
the
main
clause.
therefore,
the--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--the
government
is
incorrect,
your
honor.
we
have
identified
two
wildlife
refuges,
the
kenai
moose
range
and
the
kodiak
bear
refuge,
that
were
otherwise
encompassed
by
the
main
clause
but
saved
by
the
proviso.
and
here's
why
the
united
states
is
correct
on
that.
they
argue
in
their
brief
that
those
properties
were
not
included
in
the
main
clause
because
they
were
created
under
the
alaska
game
law
of
1925
rather
than
the
alaska
game
law
of
1943.
in
fact,
your
honors,
those
are
the
exact
same
statute.
the
'43
alaska
game
law
simply
restated
the
1925
law
with
certain
amendments.
what
that
means
is
that
at
statehood
the
kenai
moose
range
and
the
kodiak
bear
refuge
were,
in
fact,
being
used
for
the
purposes
under
the
alaska
game
law
of
'43,
which
was
the
then-existing
version.
these
refuges
were
created
in
1941
prior
to
the
restatement
and
amendment
of
the
statute.
so
those
are
two
properties.
and...
and
actually
the
legislative
history...
we
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
go
to
the
legislative
history
because
the
statute
is
plain
and
also
because
there's
a
clear
statement
rule.
but
the
legislative
history
does
indicate
that
congress
was
specifically
concerned
about
those
two
very
large
refuges.
the
kenai
and
the
kodiak
together
comprise
an
area
that
is
approximately
the
same
size
as
the
state
of
connecticut.
and
congress'
concern
or,
more
specifically,
the
concern
of
the
fish
&
wildlife
service
was
that
alaska
might
not
be
able
adequately
to
manage
those
properties.
but
there
was
no
such
concern
expressed
with
the
monument
that's
at
issue
here
because
it
was
never
going
to
be
transferred
to
the
state
under
the
main
clause.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
we
are
advocating
the
tests
set
out
in
the
idaho
case,
your
honor.
that
test
is
a
two-pronged
test.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
first,
you
have
to
look
and
see
if
there
is
a--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--that's...
that's
relevant
to
the
first
prong,
your
honor.
the
second
prong--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--if
the
court
were
examining
the...
the
first
prong,
your
honor,
i
think
those
factors
might
be
relevant.
here,
though,
the
test
is
set
out
in
not
only
the
idaho
case
but
also
the
alaska
case,
and
that
is
that
there
has
to
be
an
explicit
action
by
congress.
and
idaho
applies
that.
idaho
looked
very
carefully
for
some
action
by
congress
ratifying
the
reservation
in
that
case.
here,
we
need
an
action
by
congress.
the
united
states
has
identified
what
they
contend
is
the
action
of
congress,
that
is,
the
proviso
to
section
6(e)
of
the
alaska
statehood
act.
that
proviso,
though,
just
does
not
cover
these
lands.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
in--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
in
the--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
your
honor,
in
the
alaska
case...
and
here
i
refer
the
court
to
page
44
of
the
1997
alaska
case.
there
the
court
said
that
congress
must,
quote,
explicitly
recognize
or
that
congress
had
explicitly
recognized
the
resignation
in
that
case.
so
the...
the
court--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
i...
i
think
explicit--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--it
has
to
be
definitely...
justice
breyer,
you're
correct.
it
has
to
be--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--definitely
clear
or
otherwise
made
plain.
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
there
is
something
special
about
the
water,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
the
court
has
recognized.
the
water
is
a
state...
an
essential
attribute
of
state
sovereignty,
and
just
to--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--first
of
all,
the
geysers
are
not
included
because
we're
talking
about
navigable--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
navigable
waters.
[laughter]
but
let
me...
let
me
just
assure
the
court.
there
is
nothing
at
all
unusual
about
state-owned
submerged
lands
within
national
monuments.
the
reason
is
simple.
the
antiquities
act,
which
allows
the
president
to
designate
national
monuments,
was
enacted
in
1906.
at
that
time
there
were
45
states
already
in
the
union.
therefore,
any
national
monument
created
in
those
45
states
would
necessarily
have
included
state-owned
submerged
lands
unless
there
had
been
some
conveyance.
and
let...
let
me
give
your
honors
a...
a
concrete
example.
in
the
1978
california
decision
decided
by
this
court,
the
court
recognized
that
the
channel
islands
national
monument,
which
is
an
offshore
national
monument
off
the
coast
of
california,
included
state-owned
submerged
lands
because
even
though
the
reservation
order
was
asserted
to
have
included
those
lands,
there
was
no
congressional
statement
of
an
intent
to
defeat
the
state's
title.
another--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
yellowstone
was
created
before
the
state
of
wyoming
and--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--one
would
need
to
examine
the
particular
reservations
and
statutes
there.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i'm
not
familiar
with
that,
but
i
will
give
you
an
example
that
i
am
familiar
with.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no.
it's
the
former
rule,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
it's
not--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
first
of
all,
this
is
not
the
ordinary...
in
this
case
we
presumed
the...
the
opposite.
in
fact,
there's
a
strong
presumption.
but
let
me
give
you
the
other
example
that
i
was
going
to
refer
to
you.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
there's
something
called
the
california
coastal
national
monument.
that
extends
the
entire
length
of
california
and
goes
out
12
miles
to
sea.
in
that
monument,
the...
the
lands,
the
submerged
lands,
are
both
state-owned
and
federal-owned,
and
they
are
managed
cooperatively.
and
that's
what
we
are
seeking
to
do
here.
and
importantly,
the
fact--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
there
are
a
few
things,
presumably
very
localized
activities
that
the
state
would
have
the
exclusive
authority
in.
importantly
though,
the
federal
government,
even
though
the
state
owns
title
here,
will
retain
all
of
its
constitutional
authority
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause
to
regulate
activities
that
affect
interstate
commerce
that--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--as...
as
a
practical
matter,
there
are
issues
relating
to
local
subsistence
fishing
that
are
important
to
the
state.
there
are
issues
relating
to
local
uses
of
the
bay.
but
more
importantly--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
one
explicit
example
is
i
think
the
state
would
prefer
to
have
more
local
subsistence
fishing
in
the
bay.
and
the
court...
to...
to
move
out
a
bit,
the--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--i
think--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--as
a
practical
matter.
and...
and
there...
there--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
if--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--if
congress
really
wanted
to,
congress
could...
could
affect
activities
relating
to
interstate
commerce.
but
importantly,
what
alaska
seeks
here
really
is
a
seat
at
the
table.
right
now
alaska
has
no
say
over
anything
that
happens
in
its
navigable
waters
which
are
its
sovereign
state
lands.
what
it
seeks
really
is
to
have
its
views
being
considered.
right
now...
and
i'll
give
you
a
concrete
example
that
goes
to
the
enclaves
that
are
issue
in
the...
in
the
next
count
that
i'll
discuss.
for
some
time
cruise
ships
were
going
out
into
the
middle
of
these
enclaves
and
dumping
their
untreated
sewage
because
that
was
outside...
or
asserted
by
the
government
to
be
outside
the
scope
of
alaska's
pollution
laws
and
not
within
the
scope
of
federal
laws.
that
was
fixed,
but
it
took
an
act
of
congress
to
do
that.
there
had
to
be
an
act
of
congress
to
prohibit
those
cruise
ships
from
dumping
their
sludge
out
in
these,
what
they
used
to
call,
donut
holes.
alaska
finds
it
unacceptable
to
have
to
go
petition
congress
every
time
something
comes
up
on
its
navigable
waters
that
it
believes
ought
to
be
regulated
or
dealt
with.
now,
if
congress
decides
to
preempt
the
state
under
its
interstate
commerce
power,
it
has
the
right
to
do
that.
i
think
we
also
need
to
keep
in
mind
what
waters
we're
talking
about.
this
is
southeast
alaska.
the
waters
of
southeast
alaska
quite
literally
define
the
region.
they
are
central
to
the
economy,
the
history,
the
society,
and
the
culture
of
all
the
alaskans
who
live
there
and
who
travel
there.
just
to
take
an
example,
there
are
still
today
very
few
roads
anywhere
in
southeast
alaska,
and
the...
the
towns
and
the
cities
like
the...
the
state
capital
of
juneau
historically
were
accessible
only
by
the
water.
this
is
an
area...
the
water
in
particular
is
an
area
that
is
of
great
importance
to
alaska.
and
they
are
seeking
to
confirm
that
that
area
does
belong
to
alaska.
and
i
think
we
have
set
forth
in
quite
detail
why--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
the...
the
tests
are
different.
the
glacier
bay
test
involves...
needs
to
have
an
explicit
reservation...
explicit
ratification
by
congress
of
a
reservation
and--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--the
tests
are
different.
what
i
was
trying
to
explain
is,
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
why
this
matters
to
alaska.
it
matters
quite--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
there
are
two
issues.
i
think
it's
fishing
and
also
to
allow
more
local
people
to
visit
the
area
that
would
otherwise
be
prohibited
by
the
park
service.
there
was...
but
just
to
assure
your
honors--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
that's
normally
what...
what
people
do
is
they
just
visit
the--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--by
boats.
but
to
assure
your
honor,
there...
for
example,
there
are
no
mineral
interests
here
anywhere
in
the
picture.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
80
percent
of
the
park,
even
if
one
assumes
it
included
the
submerged
lands,
is
uplands.
but
it's
no
more
unusual--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes,
but
i
just
mentioned,
for
example,
the
two
monuments
in
california.
the
channel
islands
national
monument
this
court
held
included
the...
the
submerged
lands
were
state-owned.
there's
no
other
way
to
get
to
the
channel
islands
monument
but
to
traverse
state-owned
submerged
lands.
in
fact,
i
think
there
are
few
national
parks
in
this
country
you
can't
get
to
without
going
across
state
lands.
i
think
there's
another
important
point
here
and
that
is
the
property
clause
of
the
constitution
would
also
allow
the
federal
government
to
regulate
activities
on
lands
that
abut
national
parks
to
the
extent
that
they
might
affect
park
activities.
but
here
what
we
need
is
an
express
statement
by
congress
ratifying
the
purported
reservation
of
the
bay.
without
that,
your
honors...
and
the...
the
precedents
are
clear.
without
that,
the
presumption
is...
in
fact,
the
strong
presumption
is...
that
these
are
state-owned
lands.
and
again,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
unusual.
that
is
part
of
our
federal
system.
it's
the
way
that
these
monument
properties
have
been
managed
since
1906
when
the
president
first
got
the
authority.
it's
the
way
that
glacier
bay
will
continue
to
be
managed.
we
expect,
we
intend
to
work
cooperatively
with
the
federal
government
to
resolve
any
issues
that
might
remain.
what
we're
seeking
here,
again,
is
a
seat
at
the
table.
we
just
are
seeking
to
have
alaska's
views
dealt
with
because
they
are
the
owner.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
the...
the
court
expressly
stated
that
it
was
at
pages
60
to
61,
and
that
was
in
the
absence
of
any
contrary
argument.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
the
court
made
an
assumption,
but
in
fact--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--i
think
there
would
have
been
a
substantial...
had
that...
had
that
issue
been
litigated,
there
would
have
been
a
substantial
argument
that
it
was
not
within
the
main
clause.
but
again,
there
was
no
argument
on
that
point
before
the
court.
the
court
at
pages
60
to
61
expressly
stated...
again,
it
was
an
assumption,
but
the
court
expressly
stated
that
the
lands
were
within
the
main
clause.
apparently
the
court
was
considering
the
fact
that
the
application
for
anwr
did,
in
fact,
reference
the
purposes
that
were
set
forth
in
the
main
clause,
the
alaska
game
law.
the
important
point
of
that
case
for
this
case,
though,
your
honors,
is
that
the
court
embraced
the
construction
of
section
6(e)
that
we
are
advocating
here,
namely
that
the
proviso
exempts
and
saves
for
the
federal
government
a
subset
of
the
properties
that
would
otherwise
have
been
transferred
to
the
state
under
the
main
clause.
there
simply
was
no
need
for
congress
to
have
expressed
an
intent--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--i
think
what
i
said
is
that
the
court
embraced
that
position,
and
it
was
actually
an
essential
attribute
of
the...
essential
premise
for
the
court's
holding.
at
60
to
61
and
again
at
page
48
of
the...
the
decision,
what
the
court
made
clear
is
it
was
concerned
that
unless
the
lands
were
saved
by
the
proviso,
all
of
them,
the
submerged
lands
and
the
uplands,
would
have
passed
to
alaska
under
the
main
clause,
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
the
court,
i
think,
held
that
it
was
covered
by
the
proviso.
no
such
concern
is
present
here.
i'd
like
at
this
point
briefly
to
turn,
if
i
might,
to
the
count
i,
which
is
the
historic
waters
count.
there
the
united
states
asserts
that
at
statehood
the
waters
of
southeast
alaska
were
riddled
with
isolated
enclaves
of
international
high
seas
that
were
wholly
surrounded
by
u.s.
territorial
waters.
the
historical
record,
though,
belies
that
contention.
at
least
from
1903
until
1971,
the
united
states
took
what
this
court
has
described
in
the
mississippi
sound
case,
the
alabama
and
mississippi
boundary
case,
as
the
publicly
stated
policy
that
the
waters
of
the
archipelago
were
inland
and
that
the
political
boundary
ran
along
the
outside
edge.
thereafter,
the
united
states
took...
consistently
based
a
discriminatory
enforcement
regime,
fisheries
enforcement,
on
that
position.
what
i
mean
by
discriminatory
is
that
the
united
states
allowed
u.s.
fishing
but
prohibited
foreign
fishing
in
that
area.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
that's
the
assertion.
my
answer
is
that
the
court
announced
to
the
contrary
in
the
1975
decision,
the
cook
inlet
case,
there
at
page
201
and
202,
and
this
is
quoted
at
page
28
of
the
blue
brief.
what
the
court
said
there
is
it
examined
an
incident
in
which
a
japanese
fishing
vessel
had
been
caught
in
the
general
area,
and
the
court
said...
and
i
quote...
that
incident
deserves
scrutiny
because
the
seizure
of
a
foreign
vessel
more
than
3
miles
from
shore
manifests
an
assertion
of
sovereignty
to
exclude
foreign
vessels
altogether
and,
quote,
must
be
viewed
as
an
exercise
of
authority
over
the
waters
in
question.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i'm
sorry.
that's
201
to
202...
201
and
202
of
the
cook
inlet
case,
and
that's
at
28
of
the
blue
brief.
what
the
law
was
at
statehood
is
the
united
states
had
no
authority,
after
3
miles
out,
to
enforce
discriminatory
fishing
regulations
against
foreign
vessels.
now,
importantly
there's
a
caveat
here,
and
that
is
that
the
law
has
changed.
the
law
has
changed
since
1971.
beginning
in
1976,
the
united
states
asserted
a
200-mile...
what's
known
as
an
exclusive
economic
zone
that
allows
the
united
states
to
enforce
discriminatory
fishing,
and
in
1982
international
law
embraced
that.
but...
and
we
have
quoted
a
u.n.
study.
in
fact,
the
u.n.
study
that
we
have
quoted...
and
that
is
noted
at
page
29
of
the
blue
brief.
that
is
the
study
that's
called
the
juridical
regime
study.
it's
the
study
that
this
court
itself,
in
all
of
its
historic
waters
cases,
has
used
as
the
authoritative
statement
of
the
law.
that
study
quite
clearly
states
that
if
a...
if
a
country
enforced
discriminatory
fishing
rules
against
foreign
vessels
outside...
that
that
manifests
an
assertion
of
an
historic
inland
waters
claim.
and
what
we
have
here--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--no.
your
honor,
they
assert
that,
but
they
don't
provide
any
specific
examples.
and
the
reason
they
can't
provide
a
specific
example
of
any
instance
abroad
where
it
would
affect
their
position
is
that
each
historic
waters
inquiry
is
decided
on
its
own
facts.
the
fact
that
something
is
an
archipelago
does
not
render
it
historic
waters.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
it
is
a
claim
to
the...
to
the
waters,
which
was
made
in
1903,
accompanied
with
discriminatory
fishing
enforcement,
accompanied
with
other
statements
in
this
case,
including
the
california
brief
to
this
court.
there
has
to
be
an...
excuse
me...
examination
of
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
before
one
can
conclude
that
waters
are
historic
waters.
these
ones
are.
other
waters
would
not
be.
the
united
states
has
not
identified
any
waters
abroad
that
have
precisely
these
constellation
of
facts.
so
its...
its
position
is
basically:
we
say
it,
therefore
it
must
be
so.
i--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
right.
what
the
united
states
does,
your
honor,
is
follow
the
well-settled
international
law
on
historic
bays...
historic
waters.
those
are
set
forth
in
the
convention.
each
state
will
have
the
same
authority
where
its
facts
and
circumstances
dictate
it.
if
there
has
been
a
continuous
claim
asserted
by
a
nation
with
the
acquiescence
of
foreign
nations,
then
it
will
qualify
as
historic
waters.
but
it
has
to
be
done
based
on
a...
an
examination
of
the
particular
facts
of
the
case.
and
one
thing
else...
one
thing
other
that
is
worth
noting,
if
you
have
an
archipelago
like
this,
a
nation
can
always
close
it
off
using
article
4
straight
baselines.
that
is
permitted
under
the
convention.
the
u.s.
has
decided
not
to
do
that,
but
other
states
are
fully
able
to
do
that.
i
think
that
if
the
united
states
is
going
to
be
arguing
that
there
is
some
international
precedent
here
that's
going
to
hurt
it
adversely,
it
needs
to
identify
a
particular
body
water
abroad
that
it
believes
this
case
is
going
to
affect.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
it...
it
needs
to
explain
more
specifically
then,
other
than
just
stating
we
think
it
might
affect
our
position.
the...
the
facts
and
circumstances...
the
court,
for
example,
applied
the
historic
bay
question
in
mississippi
sound,
in
the
mississippi
sound
case.
i
am
aware
of
no
instance
in
which
that
precedent
was
ever
used
adversely
and
the
united
states
has
not
identified
any...
any
instance.
but
more
importantly,
what
this
court
did
in
the
mississippi
sound
case
is
it
looked
at
the
evidence
and
it
said
is
this
a
historic
bay
or
is
it
not.
the
court
concluded
that
it
was
and
that
was
the
inquiry
that
the
court
follows.
at
this
point,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
thank
you,
your
honor.
to
get
back
to
the
idaho
case,
we
are,
in
fact,
advocating
the
principles
of
that
case.
it
is
not
sufficient
that
congress
be
on
notice
of
a
reservation
that
might
include
submerged
lands.
congress
has
to
take
some
action
to
explicitly
ratify
that.
that
was
what
happened
in
the
idaho
case,
according
to
the
court.
and
the
united
states
has
identified
one
statute
and
one
statute
only
that
it
asserts
can...
ratifies
the
bay,
and
that's
section
6(e),
the
proviso.
we
think
the
plain
language
to
section
(e)...
6(e)
is
dispositive
in
this
case.
we
are
operating
here
under
a
clear
statement
rule.
the
presumption
is,
in
fact,
the
strong
presumption
is,
that
if
congress
does
not
expressly
ratify
the
reservation,
congress
is
presumed
not
to
have
intended
that
the
submerged
lands...
title
to
submerged
lands
be
defeated.
there
was...
the
statute
says
such
transfer
shall
not
include.
there
simply
was
no
need
for
congress
to
have
included...
to
have
specified
that
such
transfer,
the
main
clause
transfer,
shall
not
include
submerged
lands
when
they
were
not
included...
or
excuse
me...
shall
not
include
properties
that
were
not
included
in
the
first
place.
that
includes
glacier
bay.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
my...
my
first
response
is
even
the
master,
who
ruled...
who...
who
decided
against
us,
did
not
find
that
the
alaska
case
decided
that,
and
indeed,
it
could
not
have
because
the
court
at
pages
60
and
61
expressly
assumed
that
the
lands
would
fall
within
the
proviso.
therefore...
excuse
me.
the
main
clause.
therefore
the
court
did
not
hold
and
could
not
have
held
that
lands
that
did
not
fall
within
the
main
clause
were
included
by
the
proviso.
it
is
important,
though,
to...
to
note
this,
that
even
if
the
statute
is
ambiguous...
and
we
think
that
it
is
not...
alaska
still
prevails
here
because
a...
there
is
a
clear
statement
rule
and
a
clear
statement
rule
cannot
be
satisfied
by
definition
by
an
ambiguous
statute.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
it--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--we
dispute
that
for
the
following
reason,
your
honor,
that...
that
the...
the
point
of
the
monument
was
to
study
the
glaciers
and
the
effects
of
the
glaciers
as
they
recede
on
dry
land.
title
to
the
submerged
lands
was
simply
not
necessary
for
that
purpose.
but
i
think
their
sky-is-falling
argument
really
falls
apart
here.
all
that
the
counsel
can
point
to
is
the
idea
is
that
they
would
like
scientists
to
go
scuba
diving
down
there
and
to
perhaps
look
at
the
bottom.
there
is
absolutely
no
contention
here
that
alaska
would...
would
prevent
scientists
who
want
to
study
this...
these
lands
from
doing
that.
we
let
scientists
onto
all
of
our
properties,
all
of
our
submerged
lands
when
they
have
a
good
reason
for
doing
it.
we
hope
to
work
cooperatively
with
the
federal
government
on
this.
the...
the
idea
that
alaska
is
somehow
going
to
be
less
receptive
to
scientific
research
here
i
think
demeans
our
federal
structure.
we
have
a
federal
structure
here
under
which
sovereignty
of
submerged
lands
is
given
to
the
states
because
they
are
viewed
as
the
ones
principally
affected
by
the
activities
that
go
on
there.
we
are
not
planning
on...
on
preventing
scientists
from
scuba
diving
down
there.
by
the
way,
they
did
not
at
the
time
of
the
monument,
your
honor,
do
scuba
diving
because
there...
there
really
wasn't
any
scuba
diving
going
on.
but
to...
to
move
on...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
