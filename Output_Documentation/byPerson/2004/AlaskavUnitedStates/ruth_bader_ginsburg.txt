--problem,
as...
you
just
said
that...
that
the
main
clause
is
very,
very
narrow,
and
we're
told
by
the
government
that
no
wildlife
reservation
would
come
within
that
main
clause,
so
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
retain
under
the
second
clause.
justice

ginsburg
in
the...
in
the
'97
case,
was
the
area
at
issue
within
the
first
part
of
6(e)?
because
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it...
it
made
an
assumption.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
was
it
in
fact?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
the
united
states
that
will
be
making
the
judgment
about
what
areas
are
controlled.
it
would
be
the
country
abroad.
and
i...
i
think
the
argument
was,
what
the
united
states
does
other
nations
will
copy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
will
decide
what
looks
like
the
alaska--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
should
it
make
that
suggestion?
it
would
certainly
not
be
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
court
did
assume...
the
court
did
assume
that.
