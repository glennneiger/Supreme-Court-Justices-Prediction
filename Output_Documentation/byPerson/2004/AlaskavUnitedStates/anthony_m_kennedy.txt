well,
given
the
absence

we

justice
anthony

the
first
case
in
which
i
have
the
opinion
for
the
court
is
no.128
original,
the
state
of
alaska
versus
the
united
states
of
america.
this
is
an
original
jurisdiction
case
that
requires
us
to
resolve
alaska’s
dispute
with
the
united
states,
and
the
dispute
concerns
title
to
certain
submerged
lands,
some
of
them
very
extensive
located
in
southeast
alaska.
after
alaska
filed
its
complaint
seeking
the
declaration
that
it
had
title
to
the
submerged
lands
in
dispute,
we
appointed
professor
gregory
e.
maggs
to
act
as
special
master
in
this
matter.
in
a
detailed
report,
he
has
recommended
that
the
court
grant
summary
judgment
to
the
united
states
with
respect
to
all
the
submerged
lands
at
issue.
we
set
the
case
for
all
argument
on
alaska’s
exceptions
to
the
special
master’s
report
and
we
now
overrule
each
of
alaska’s
exceptions.
there
are
two
different
areas
of
submerged
lands
at
issue
in
the
case
and
each
requires
a
different
analysis.
the
first
area
consists
of
pockets
and
enclaves
of
submerged
lands
underlying
waters
in
and
between
fringing
certain
islands
in
southeastern
alaska
and
these
islands
are
known
as
the
alexander
archipelago.
for
these
submerged
lands,
the
dispositive
question
is
whether
the
alexander
archipelago
waters
qualify
as
inland
waters.
if
they
do,
then
alaska
has
title
to
the
submerged
lands
by
reason
of
the
presumption
of
title
that
states
have
to
submerged
lands
underlying
all
inland
navigable
waters
within
their
boundaries.
alaska
advances
two
theories
under
which
the
alexander
archipelago
waters
would
qualify
as
inland
waters.
alaska
first
argues
that
they
so
qualify
because
they
have
historically
been
treated
as
such.
the
special
master
rejected
this
argument
and
we
rejected
it
as
well,
and
the
analysis
requires
you
to
examine
the
history
of
the
control
over
these
waters,
and
that
turns
in
large
part
on
whether
the
united
states
or
before
the
united
states
russia
asserted
the
right
to
exclude
foreign
vessels
and
navigation
from
these
waters.
at
best,
alaska’s
submissions
before
this
court
established
that
the
united
states
made
one
official
statement
in
1903
in
a
boundary
arbitration
describing
the
archipelago
waters
as
inland
and
that
the
united
states
seized
one
foreign
vessel
in
1924
in
a
manner
arguably
consistent
with
the
status
of
those
waters
as
inland.
these
incidents
are
insufficient
to
demonstrate
the
continuous
assertion
of
the
right
to
exclude
with
the
acquiescence
of
foreign
nations.
alaska’s
alternative
theory
to
justify
treating
the
alexander
archipelago’s
waters
as
inland
is
that
these
waters
in
truth
consist
of
two
vast
juridical
bays
which
by
definition
qualify
as
inland
water.
the
special
master
rejected
this
theory
and
so
do
we.
now,
they
claimed
juridical
bays
would
exist
only
if
at
a
minimum
four
islands
in
the
archipelago
were
deemed
to
form
a
constructive
peninsula
extending
from
the
main
land
and
dividing
the
archipelago’s
waters
in
two,
and
nwo
the
opinion
have
maps
and
exhibits
showing
the
claim.
even
assuming
the
existence
of
this
peninsula,
however,
alaska’s
hypothetical
bays
would
still
not
qualify
as
juridical
bays,
and
in
particular,
they
do
not
satisfy
the
descriptive
requirement
of
being
well
marked
indentations.
they
do
not
possess
physical
features
that
would
allow
a
mariner
looking
at
navigational
charts
that
do
not
depict
bay
closing
lines
nonetheless
to
perceive
the
bay's
limit
in
order
to
avoid
illegal
encroachment
into
inland
waters.
now,
the
second
area
of
submerged
land
of
dispute
consists
of
submerged
lands
beneath
glacier
bay
and
glacier
bay
is
the
centerpiece
of
glacier
bay
national
park.
glacier
bay
is
one
of
the
nation’s
largest
national
parks.
it
embraces
over
3.2
million
acres
that
is
an
area
larger
than
the
state
of
connecticut.
it
is
the
world’s
largest
marine
sanctuary
and
in
sorts
in
one
sense
a
water
park.
there
is
no
question
that
glacier
bay’s
waters
are
inland.
here,
the
controlling
question
in
this
suit
is
whether
the
united
states
can
rebut
alaska’s
presumption
of
title
to
the
submerged
lands
underlying
these
waters.
the
special
master
concluded
that
the
united
states
could
rebut
alaska’s
presumption
of
title.
we
agree
with
that
conclusion.
in
particular,
the
united
states
has
rebutted
alaska’s
presumption
of
title
by
demonstrating
that
the
submerged
lands
beneath
glacier
bay
were
included
within
the
scope
of
a
federal
reservation
that
existed
before
alaska
become
a
state
and
the
congress
at
that
time
of
statehood
expressed
its
intent
to
retain
title
to
these
submerged
lands.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous
with
respect
to
the
first
area
of
submerged
lands
in
dispute,
the
pockets
and
enclaves
of
submerged
lands
between
the
islands
of
the
alexander
archipelago.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
with
respect
to
the
second
area
of
submerged
lands
in
dispute,
the
submerged
lands
beneath
the
waters
of
glacier
bay.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
join
the
justice
scalia’s
dissenting
opinion.
