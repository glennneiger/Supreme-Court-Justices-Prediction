mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
focal
point
of
alaska's
argument,
namely
glacier
bay
national
park.
alaska's
core
contention
is
that
section
6(e)
of
the
statehood
act
does
not
provide
an
adequate
showing
that
the
united
states
intended
to
retain
the
submerged
lands
in
glacier
bay.
this--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
very
helpful.
it's
listed
at
page
7a--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--of
our...
of
the
gray
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
may...
that
may
be
so.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
6(e)
i
think
begins
stating
that
this...
these
are
exceptions
to
section
5
which
is
the
retention...
the
general
retention
provision
of
the
united...
for
united
states
lands.
but
if
we
look
at
6(e)
itself,
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no.
actually
there
doesn't,
your
honor,
because
if
you
go
on,
it
says
all
real
and
personal
property...
then
you
skip
down,
about
halfway
down...
shall
be
transferred
and
conveyed
to
the
state
of
alaska
by
the
appropriate
federal
agency.
so
it
is...
so
this
is
complete
in
terms
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
if
i
could
walk
you
through
those
provisions
because
i
think
they're
quite
important.
the
first
provision
says,
as
you
say,
all
real
and
personal
property
which
is
specifically
used
for
the
sole
purpose
of
conservation
and
protection
of
wildlife
shall
be
transferred
to
the
united
states.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it's
followed
by
another
provision
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
to...
to
alaska.
excuse
me.
and
it's
followed
by
another
proviso
which
says
that
the
united
states
will
continue
to
control
fish
and
game
matters
in
alaska
until
the
secretary
of
interior
has
certified
that
alaska
is
ready
to
do
so.
clearly
that
proviso
is
not
a
subset--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
i
don't.
i
don't
believe...
let
me
frame
the...
your...
your
question,
if
i
may,
for
you.
section
5
indicates
the
united
states
would
retain
all
of
the
lands
that
it
presently
holds.
section
6(m)
then
makes
the
submerged
lands
act
applicable
to
the...
to
the...
to
alaska.
in
doing
so,
it
recognizes
that
there
are
some
lands
the
united
states
would
continue
to
retain,
provided
it
meets
the
requirements
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
particular
exception
we're
concerned
about
here
is
the
expressly
retained
exception,
in
other
words,
if
lands
are
retained
by
the
united
states.
this
court
said
in
the
arctic
coast
case
that
that
provision
adopts
the
general
law
that
applied
before
the
submerged
lands
act,
that
it
had
to
be
made
plain
that
the
united
states
would
be
holding
onto
these
lands.
it
doesn't
require
an
express
statement.
it
simply
requires
that
it
be
made
plain.
now,
our
view
is
that
these
lands
would
be
retained
by
the
united
states,
quite
apart
from
6...
the
6(e)
exception
we're
arguing
about
here
on
summary
judgment.
and
if
you
denied
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
we'd
go
back
and
talk
about
the
other
exceptions
that
are
applicable.
but
in
this
case
we're
simply
focusing
on
6(e)
and
we're
focusing
on
that
because
the
court's
arctic
coast
decision
made
clear
that
6(e)...
and
i
quote...
reflects
the
very
clear
intent
to
retain
title,
unquote,
to
submerged
lands,
quote,
so
long
as
those
submerged
lands
were
among
those
set
apart
as
refuges
or
wildlife...
or
reservations
for
the
protection
of
wildlife.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
we
did.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
it's
an
example
how
provisos
do
not
need
to
be--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
disagree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
for
these
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
such
transfer
simply
tells
you
what's
not
included.
that
language
tells
you...
this
is
outside.
it
doesn't
mean
that
whatever
follows
necessarily
was
within
the
main
clause.
what
congress
was
doing
here,
by
making
clear
that
these
lands
were
not
transferred--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
does
refer
to
the
transfer
before.
but
what
follows
here,
refuges
and
reservations
for
the
protection
of
wildlife,
they
do
not
fit
within
that...
that
main
clause.
it's
obvious
they
don't
because
the
only
things
that
fit
within
the
main
clause
are
those
lands
and
real
property
specifically
used
for
the
sole
purpose
of
conservation
and
protection
of
wildlife.
what
we're
talking
about
here...
wildlife
reservations
are
multiple
purpose
lands.
they're
not
used
solely
for...
for
the
purpose
of
conservation.
the
purpose
of
the
first
provision
here
was
to
transfer
vehicles,
fish
hatcheries,
other
equipment
that
the
state
would
need
to
enforce
alaska
game
laws.
that
was
the
point
of...
of
that
first
provision.
but
secretary
chapman
who
drafted
this
made
clear
in
the
legislative
history
that
what
he
was
doing
was
drawing
a
line
between
those...
those
facilities
and
equipment
that
are
used
by
a
state
in
its
traditional
game
management
and
drawing
a
contrast
with
the
matters
that
would
be
retained
by
the
united
states.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
do
not
need--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
do
not
need
express
language
that
expresses--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
implication
is
that
we
are
retaining
all
of
the
reservation.
and
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
the
arctic
coast
decision.
it
saw
that
this
was--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--justice
breyer,
neither
party
made
that
argument.
this
issue
came
up
in
a
letter
that
was
written
after.
the...
the
language--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--you
were
not
considering
that.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that...
that
was...
simply
neither
party
suggested
that
anwr
fell
within
the
first
provision.
and
it
doesn't.
it's
clear
that
it
doesn't.
it
was
not
land
that
was
specifically
used
solely
for
conservation
of
wildlife
under
these
three
listed
statutes.
the
anwr
reservation
at
that
time
was
set
apart.
it
was
blm
land.
it
was
also
used
for
mining
and
other
activities.
likewise,
the
other
matters--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
made
that
assumption
with
no
briefing,
but
it
did
that
with
regard
to
the
second
issue
that
was
presented
there.
the
issue
that
people
were
fighting
about
in
the
arctic
coast
decision
was
was
this
land
properly
set
apart
or
not
for
purposes
of
the
proviso.
and
that's
where
this
discussion
takes
place.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it's
an
afterthought
that
simply
reinforces.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
but
that's...
it's
clear
that
what
this
is...
this
is
more
along
the
lines
if
someone
said
that
i
will
sell
you
my
house,
provided
that
transfer
shall
not
include
the
detached
garage.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
that
case--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
but
it
was
not
a
part
of
the
house.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
you
know,
that's...
it's
just
providing
clarification,
just
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
proviso
is
to
provide
clarification.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
other...
that
is
exactly
right.
and
we
can
tell
that
from--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
would
be
section
5.
it
indicates
the
general
retention
for
lands
of
this
sort.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
justice
breyer,
again,
if
i
can
just
complete
the
point--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i
just
need
to
make
a
point.
i
think
it's
very
important
for
you
to
understand
this
point.
first
of
all,
that
at
page
57
of
the
arctic
coast
decision,
this
court
was
clearly
reading
this
language,
the
6(e)
proviso,
as
sufficient
to
provide
a
clear
indication
of
transfer
of
title,
and
in
doing
so,
it
was
recognizing
what
is
clear
in
the
proviso
itself,
that
these
particular
items
that
are
discussed
there
are
not
a
part
of
the
main
clause
and
cannot
be.
and
a
good
example
of
that
is
the
third
thing
that's
being
transferred,
facilities
that
are
utilized
in
connection
with
general
research
activities
related
to
fisheries
and
wildlife.
now,
that
is
not
going
to
be
something
that's
specifically
used
for
the
sole
purpose
of
conservation
and
protection
of
wildlife.
it's
the
antithesis
of
that.
it
makes
quite
clear
that
our
construction
is
correct.
the
subset
theory
just
doesn't
work
because
the
items
that
are
here
are
not
things
that
fit
within
the
main
clause.
what
congress
was
doing
here
was
drawing
a
very
clear
line--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--then
you
have
to
explain
what
happened
in
the
arctic
coast
case,
why
we
were
able
to
retain
the
anwr
lands
which
did
not
fall
within
the
main
provision.
and
that
is
because
congress
was
making...
because
this
court
concluded
that
congress
was
making
clear
that
wildlife
lands
are
very
important
and
they
wanted
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
those
lands
would
not
be
transferred.
and
even
a
provision
that
could
be
misconstrued,
as
i'm
afraid
this
court
did
in...
in
arctic
coast...
could
be
misconstrued
to
contain
some
of
these
lands,
we
need
to
make
adequate
assurance
that...
that
the
courts
that
read
this
realize
a
clear
division
is
being
made.
we
are
retaining
these
wildlife
lands.
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
we're
talking
about
a
facility
here.
so
a
facility
that
might
conduct
some...
some
research
tangentially
related
to
wildlife
is
not
a
facility
that's
used
for
the
sole...
specifically
used
for
the
sole
purpose
of
conservation
and
wildlife.
there's
a
clear
difference
here.
these
two...
these
two
sets
do
not
overlap,
and
it's
even
more
so
with
regard
to
wildlife
refuges.
wildlife
refuges
and
wildlife
reservations
are
used
for
multiple
purposes.
at
the
time
of
statehood,
the...
the
regulations
in
place,
the
fisheries
regulations
and
wildlife
regulations,
made
clear
that
permits
could
be
issued
for
purposes
apart
from
wildlife
conservation.
and
this
court's
own
decision
in
udall
v.
tallman
recognized
that
one
of
the...
the
refuges
that
alaska
cites
as
being
included
in
the
main
clause
was
being
used
for
oil
and
gas
purposes.
it
was
not
being
used
solely
for
the
purposes...
specifically
used
solely
for
the
purposes
of
conservation.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
this...
we
believe
the
statute
has
been
clear
for
50
years.
that's
why
these
issues
have
only
arisen
recently
with
regard
to
glacier
bay
national
park.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
agree
that
the
united
states
has
the
regulatory
authority
to
protect...
to
limit
vessel
entries
and
protect
commercial
fishing,
but
that's
not
what
our
concern
is.
our
concern
is
with
the
actual
use
of
the
submerged
lands.
this
is
a
laboratory.
this
is
a
laboratory
for
scientific
research,
and
we
occupy
and
use
the
submerged
lands
for
that
purpose.
that
includes
such
things
as
withdrawing
cores
of
materials
so
we
can
analyze
its
historic
features.
we've
installed
a
5-mile
cable
with
a
hydrophone
on
the...
on
the
submerged
lands
so
we
can
listen
to
vehicle
traffic
and
determine
if
the...
the
volume
is
sufficient
to
interfere
with
the
whales
that
migrate
through
there.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
in
order
to
hear
vehicle
traffic--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
we
think
that...
that
alaska
would
have
a
realistic
argument
that
we
cannot
withdraw
materials
from
the
submerged
land
which
we
use
and
study.
and
in
fact,
i
would
point
out
that
the
park
superintendent's
affidavit--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--what?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there
are
900
papers,
scientific
papers,
that
are
cited
in
the
affidavit
of
the
park
superintendent.
this
is
exhibit
number
8
on
count
iv.
and
of
those
describing
the
type
of
research
we
do
in
glacier
bay
national
park--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--scores
and
perhaps
hundreds
of
those
involve
submerged
lands.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
those
are
instances--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
instances...
the
examples
they're
giving
are
cases
in
which
we've
created
those
national
monuments
or
parks
after
statehood.
and
in
those
cases,
we
cannot
acquire
those
lands
because
they
have
already
been
transferred
to
the
state
at
statehood.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
in
this
case--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
in
this
case,
it
is
going
to
impede
the...
the
activities
we
have
there.
and
a
good
example
of
this
is
in
the
amicus
brief
at
page
25
where
alaska
does
not
even
assent
to
our
authority
to
control
fish
and
wildlife.
the
alaska
legislature
has
passed
a
statute
in
which
it
refuses
to
assent
to
our
authority
to
control
fish
and
wildlife
within
the
park.
this
gives
you
some
sense
of
the
type
of
difficulties
that
we're
going
to
encounter.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
our
chief
concern--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
it
was.
it
was
created
as
a
national
monument.
now,
in
terms
of
what
degree
of
activities,
the
record
is
not
clear,
but
we're--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
were
definitely
studying
the
bed
of
the
lake,
and
our...
our
briefs
below
explain.
we
have
an
affidavit
from
our
glaciologist
which
describes
the
type
of
research
that
was
being
done.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it...
it
definitely
would
have.
and
also
i
want
to
point
out
that
when
we
created
the
national
monument,
we
also
preserved
such
things
as
the
interglacial
forests.
these
are
forests
that
are
left
behind
as
the
glaciers
retreat
and
go
forward
over
these
submerged
lands.
the
glacial
forests
are
in
the
submerged
lands,
and
so
they
become
a
part
of
it.
as
these
glaciers
continue
to
retreat,
it's
likely
that
other
glacial
forests
will
be
revealed,
and
those
should
remain
a
part
of
the
park.
that
was
part
of
the
purpose,
was
to
study
those--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
certainly--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--not
only
have
we
said
it,
but
the
park
service
at
statehood
said
that
this
is
a
water
park
when
they
were
describing
these
lands
and
saying
why
they
should
be
retained.
they
told
congress...
the...
the
park
superintendent
or
the...
the
director
of
the
park
service
said
this
is
a
water
park
that's
mostly...
this
is,
after
all,
glacier
bay
national
park.
and
in
that...
with
that
respect,
i'd
like
to
point
out
this--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it's
slightly
more
than
20--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
haven't
given
away.
we
have
all
of
these
lands.
the...
the
uplands
here
are
the
glaciers
and
the
mountains
that
are
inaccessible
except
by
the
water.
you
cannot
reach
these
areas.
there
are
no
roads
in
this
park
except
for
the
park
visitors
center,
and
beyond
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
but,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--more
than
20
percent.
roughly
25.
i'd
say
close
to
25
percent
of
the
park
is...
within
the
park
boundaries
is
submerged
lands.
but
there's
another
point
i'd
like
to
make
with
regard
to
the
establishment
of
the
park.
this
park
was
created
under
the
antiquities
act,
and
under
the
antiquities
act,
the
president
is
given
authority
to
create
national
monuments,
but
they
cannot
be
disestablished
except
by
act
of
congress.
now,
congress
could
have
disestablished
this
monument
if
it
had
meant
to
give
up
the
land.
it
could
have
disestablished
some
part
of
it,
and
it
chose
not
to
do
so.
and
yet,
that's
another
indication
that
congress
was
intending
to
retain
these
lands.
now,
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
the
other
two
counts
we
have
here,
unless
we
have
further
questions
about...
about
glacier
bay.
but
i...
i
think
one
thing
that
i
do...
one
thought
i
want
you...
to
leave
you
with
with
regard
to
glacier
bay
is
that
these
lands
are
essential
to
the
park.
they
are
understood
to
be
essential
at
the
time
that
the
park
was
created.
and
the...
the
line
we're
suggesting
here
is
a
very
reasonable
one
with
regard
to
this
park.
those
lands
are...
continue
to
be
used...
the
submerged
lands
for
scientific
research
that
is
vitally
important.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
master
also
correctly
rejected
the
claim
that
the
archipelago
straits
are
historic
inland
waters,
and
on
that
basis,
alaska
failed
to
satisfy
any
part
of
the
court's
three-part
test.
this
court
specifically
failed
to
show
a
continuous
assertion
of...
of
sovereignty
to
exclude
vessels
that
have...
that
are
visiting
the
park
or
passing
through
in
innocent
passage
or
to
indicate
any
acquiescence
of
foreign
nations.
during
the
past
150-year
period,
neither
alaska
nor
the
united
states
ever
attempted
to
exclude
a
vessel
based
on...
merely
on
innocent
passage.
rather,
alaska...
alaska
cannot
point
to
a
single
incident
in
which
we
unambiguously
did
so.
the
only--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
answer
is
in
order
to
establish
a
historic
inland
water
claim,
you
have
to
exclude
a
vessel
based
on
this
passing
through
in
innocent
passage.
fisheries
is
not...
engaging
in
fishing
activity
under
the
convention
is
not
innocent
passage.
and
so,
therefore,
an
exclusion
based
on
fisheries
can
never...
can
never
give
rise
to
a
claim
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
our
best
authority
is
the
convention
itself.
the
convention
makes
clear
under
article
14
that
fisheries
is...
that
fisheries
activities
are
not
innocent
passage.
rather,
innocent
passage
is
merely
transit
through
from
one
point
to
another.
moreover,
the
marguerite
incident
that
they
describe
involves
a
single
incident;
that
is,
it
does
not
satisfy
the
continuity
requirement
that
the
inland...
the
historic
inland
waters
test
requires.
and
finally,
it
also
didn't
satisfy
the
acquiescence
test
since
the
british
government
protested
the
seizure
of
the
ship.
and
finally
on
top
of
that,
this
vessel...
we
don't
know
exactly
where
this
vessel
was
at
the
time
that
it
was
seized.
there
continues
to
be
a
dispute
and
the
master
was
unable
to
determine
whether
that...
the
ship
was
in...
inside
or
outside
the
3-mile
limit.
now,
i'd
also
like
to
speak
briefly
to
the
juridical...
juridical
bay
claim
as
well.
this
is
a
matter
that
alaska
did
not
touch
upon,
but
i
imagine
it
would
address
on
rebuttal.
the
master
correctly
rejected
alaska's
extraordinary
claim
that
the
alexander
archipelago
can
be
turned
into
two
large...
large
juridical
bays.
and
basically
it
attempted
to
do
so
by
establishing
a
headland
on
an
island.
now,
that
does
not
suffice
the
purpose
of
the
convention.
the
only
way
that
it
can
establish
a
bay
headland
or...
or
closing
point
is
by
showing
that
it's
on
the
mainland.
in
order
to
establish
that
this
is
on
the
mainland,
alaska
has
to
ignore
four
intervening
bodies
of
water.
and
as
the
master
recognized,
these
bodies
of
water
are
simply
too
substantial
to
ignore.
in
the
case
of
these
bodies
of
water,
keku
strait
is
41
miles
long,
on
average
4
and
a
half
miles
wide.
it's...
simply
those
intervening
waters
cannot
be
ignored
in
order
to
establish
that
this
is...
is
part
of
the
mainland.
it's
also
separated
by
wrangell
narrows,
which
is
a
12-mile-long
strait
that
is
an
important
passage
for
international
navigation.
that
too
precludes
it
from
being
ignored
and
treated
as
dry
land.
the
failure
of
those
two
assimilations
by
itself
is
sufficient
to
establish
that...
that
these...
that
these
juridical
bays
do
not
exist.
and
even
if
that
were
not
enough,
the
master
went
on
to
say
that
this
would
not
be
a
well-marked
indentation,
that
even
if
you
were
willing
to
assimilate
these
lands,
it's
still
the
case
that
the
bay
itself
would
not
be...
the
supposed,
imaginary
bays
that
alaska
has
created
here
would
not
be
recognizable
to
a
mariner
who
is
passing
by.
for
all
those
reasons,
the
juridical
bays
here
are...
are
simply
not
well
founded,
and
the
master
was
correct
in
rejecting
them.
so
what
we
see--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--quite--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--quite
honestly
we
thought
that
under
the
arctic
coast
decision,
the
court
is
required
to
create
absolutely
new...
no
new
law.
it
had
already
interpreted
6(e)
and
it
was
clear
that
section
6(e)
applied
to
this
case.
we
think
the
idaho
provisions
provide
another
opportunity
for
us
to
establish
it.
it's
quite
clear
that
the
purposes
of
the...
the
lands
here,
the
submerged
lands,
are
so
essential
to
the
park
that
it's
simply
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
intended
for
those
lands
to
pass
out
of
ownership.
however,
we
relied
on--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
first
of
all,
alaska
has
not
moved
for
summary
judgment.
we
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
some
of
our
theories.
other
theories
would
require
some
factual
development.
one
of
the
theories
that
we
would...
we
would
go
forward
with
is
that
these
lands
are
occupied
under
a
claim
of
right,
and
that's
another
exception
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
in
addition,
we
would
renew
the
argument
with
regard
to
antiquities
act,
that
once
congress
takes
an
area
and
authorizes
the
president
to
set
it
aside
under
the
antiquities
act
and
provides
that
it
cannot
be
disestablished
except
by
act
of
congress,
we
think
that's
a
very
clear
indication
of
congress'
intent
to
retain
those
lands.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
you
would
not
have...
we...
we
believe
the
master
adverted
to
this
claim,
but
we
do
not
think
that
he
foreclosed
it.
but
rather,
i'd
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
relationship
of
idaho
and
alaska
because
i
think
it's
important
and
worthwhile.
we
think
that
this
case
falls
squarely
within
the
alaska
arctic
coast
case,
and
in
particular
we
relied
on
it
primarily
because
it
provides
an
actual
textual
basis
for
showing
that
the...
the
united
states
retain
those
lands.
we
do
not
need
to
go
further
and
show
purpose,
although
we
certainly
can.
we
relied
on
the
alaska
case
because
we
think
it
provides
a
very
clear
example
of
why
retention
is...
is
required
in
this
case.
the
master
agreed
with
us.
he
analyzed
the
arctic
coast
decision
and
he
concluded
that
the...
the
proviso
here
necessarily
must
be
considered
an
independent
retention
clause.
there's
no
other
way
to
understand
the
arctic
coast
decision
except
on
that
basis.
and
we
think
that's
the
right
interpretation,
and
we
think
if
we...
if
you
focus
on
what
the
court
said
on
pages
56
to
57,
it
becomes
quite
clear.
the
statement
that
alaska
relies
on
to
create
its
so-called
subset
test
is
an
afterthought
at
the
end
of
the
opinion.
it's
a
statement
that's
made
in
the
court's
words
to
reinforce
the
conclusion
it's
already
reached.
it
doesn't
provide
a
basis
for...
for
departing
from
that.
and
in
fact,
as
i
hope
i
have
showed
to
the
court,
the
subset
test
doesn't
make
any
sense,
that
they're
simply...
all
of
those
lands
that
fall
within
the
proviso
are
lands
that
would
not
fall
within
the
main
clause.
the
wildlife
refuge
is
occupied
for
multiple
purposes.
it's...
the
two
wildlife
refuges
that
they
point
to
both
the
record
shows
were
used
for
multiple
purposes.
they
were
not
used
solely
for
conservation
purposes.
and
in
addition,
they
were...
to
the
extent
that
those
refuges
adverted
to
any
lands
at
all...
any
statutes,
they
were
referring
to
a
1925
statute,
not...
not
the
1943
statute.
furthermore,
there
are
24
other
refuges
that
we
believe
that
congress
intended
to
retain
that
alaska
has
no
answer
for.
one...
one
of
those
refuges,
in
particular,
the
semidi
islands,
quite
clearly
describes
within
its
boundaries
submerged
lands,
reefs,
and
other
areas.
it
clearly
is
being
used
for
those
purposes.
we
think
the
right
interpretation
of
the
proviso
is
clearly
that
it
was
meant
to
ensure,
to
provide
the
clarity
that
this
court
needs
to
determine
that
congress
clearly
did
intend
to
retain
these
lands.
that
was
the
point
that...
that
this
proviso,
as
secretary
chapman
himself
indicated,
and
in
fact,
he
stated
in...
the
excerpt
appears
in
page...
on
page
47,
note
37
of
our
brief.
he
stated
that
these
reservations...
the
land
and
water
would
be
reserved.
he
clearly
was
aware
and
told
congress
that
that
was
the
purpose
here,
to
reserve
both
land
and
water.
finally,
i'd
like
to
ask
the
court
to
step
back
and
look
at
the
big
picture
here.
the
united
states'
position
overall
results
in
a
very
sensible
division
of
submerged
lands
in
this
case.
we
have
not
contested
alaska's
right
to
the
vast
majority
of
the
submerged
lands
here
that
are
encompassed
in
tongass
national
forest.
rather,
we've
identified
two
areas
where
the
federal
government
interests
are
paramount.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
drawing
international...
developing
international
principles
to
establish
baselines,
which
creates
these
bays
and...
and
pockets,
that's
a
necessary
consequence
of
what
our
foreign
policy
requires.
secondly,
where
the
united
states
has
clearly
reserved
a
unique
treasure,
namely
glacier
bay
national
park.
this
park
was
set
aside
for
the
benefit
of
the
entire
nation.
we
think
that
the
court
should
adopt
the
master's
report
in
full.
thank
you.
