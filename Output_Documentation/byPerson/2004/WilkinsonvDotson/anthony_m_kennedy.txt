justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
us
why...
why
is
it
still
live
when
they...
when
they
already
received
a
second
hearing?
or
why
is
not
moot?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
you
do
if
there
was
an
allegation
of
a
serious
procedural
flaw
in
a
past
hearing?
the
parole
commission
was...
was
drunk
or
they
read
the
wrong
file
or
something,
and
it
was
just
a
challenge
to
the
invalidity
of
the
past
hearing.
would
that
be
1983
or
habeas?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
why
asked
you.
why
isn't
it--
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
that's
part
of
the
conclusion
that
we're
going
to
have
to
reach
to...
to
resolve
the
case.
why
isn't
he?
how
is
that
that
much
different
than
if
a
judge...
let's
assume,
under
a
proper
sentencing
guideline
scheme,
the
judge
just
uses
the
wrong
guideline.
the
man
is
going
to
go
to
jail
for
either
5
or
10
years.
we
don't
know
which.
but
that's...
that's
a
classic
habeas
case.
here,
he's
going
to
stay
in
a
prison
for
5
or
10
years.
why
isn't
this
a
classic
habeas
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
wouldn't
completely
invalidate
the
sentence.
we
know
that
he's
still
going
to
be
held
and
he's
going
to
be
held
in
custody.
it's
a
question
of
how
long,
which
is
exactly
what
this
case
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure.
it
depends
how
you
formulate
the
order.
the...
the
judge
says,
i'm
going
to
order
this
prisoner
released
unless,
within
6
months,
he
has
a
parole
hearing
under
the
guidelines
i
set.
that's
the
way
the
habeas
statute
works.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
might--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--he
might
shorten
the
term
of
his
confinement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
when
you're
challenging
the
sentence.
he
might
but
he
might
not.
we're
just...
we're
just
hearing
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
a
1983
hearing
in
which
a
united
states
district
judge
tells
the
parole
commission,
now,
here
are
your
marching
orders
for
future
cases.
you
have
to
comply
with
this
rule,
that
rule,
this
rule.
what
is
an
analog
that
you
can
give
us
where
united
states
courts
have
done
this
under
1983?
using
an
administrative
case,
if
the...
if
the
agency
does
it
the
wrong
way,
we
reverse
that
decision.
it
would
be
like
a
review
of
a
conviction
that's
not
final.
have
we
had
cases
where
under
1983
litigants
come
in
and
say,
now,
these
agencies
are
doing
it
the
wrong
way?
you
have
to...
can
you
give
me
an
analog?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what's
your
position
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
moot?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
wilkinson
versus
datson,
no.
03-287.
