mr.
john
q.
lewis
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
straightforward
opportunity
to
apply
the
heck
rule.
respondent
johnson's
section--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--johnson
still
has
remaining
claims
for
prospective
injunctive
relief
in
this
case
and,
as
well,
declaratory
relief.
what
may
be
mooted
is
his
claim
for
retroactive
injunctive
relief,
in
other
words,
a
new
parole
hearing.
i
think
in
order
for
him
to
pursue
that
type
of
a
claim,
he'd
have
to
go
back
down
to
the
district
court.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
well,
he...
really
three
different
things.
he's
requesting
prospective
injunctive
relief,
fix
the
due
process
violations
that
are
going
on
in
ohio
parole
proceedings.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
well,
he
does
have
a
class
action.
he
filed
a
class
action
and
he's
trying
to
fix
the
proceeding
prospectively.
it
doesn't
necessarily
require
him
to
have
a
new
parole
hearing.
he's
still
in
confinement
and
will
very
likely
have
a
new
parole
hearing,
a
new
parole
hearing
that
he
wants
the
proceedings
to
be
different
in.
he's
not
necessarily
asking
for
a
new
parole
hearing.
he's
saying--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--sure.
i
think
that
was
part
of
his
claim,
which
might
be
mooted,
but
he's
also
saying
in
any
future--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--well,
we
don't--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--we
don't
know
that
for
sure,
but
part
of
his
claim
as
well
is
to
say
in
future
parole
hearings
that
i'm
going
to
be
subjected
to,
even
if
you
don't
give
me
a
new
one,
in
future
parole
hearings
that
i'm
going
to
be
subjected
to,
i
want
these
processes
fixed
to...
to
come
into
compliance
with
due
process.
and
i
think
that's
separate
and
apart
from--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--i
don't
think
there's
enough
in
the
record
to
determine
that.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
i
am
not
willing
to
assume
that.
i...
i
don't
think
we
can
say
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
we
can't
yet.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
we
may
intend
to.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
actually
2005.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
absolutely.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
that's
correct.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
that's
right,
and
as
well,
he
says
i
want
to
be
heard
at
this
next
parole
hearing.
now,
that
was...
part
of
his
due
process
allegations
in
this
case
were
that
he...
he
wasn't
even
allowed
to
meaningfully
participate
in--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--that's
essentially
it.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
and...
and
it
is
section
1983
because
it
doesn't
violate
the
heck
rule.
this--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--well,
to
the
extent
in
his
complaint
he
was
seeking
a
new
parole
hearing
as
a
result
of
the
challenge
to
the
'99
decision,
that's
probably
mooted
because
he
has
received
this
2001
hearing
and
we
just
don't
know
enough
about
it
to
know
whether
he's
going
to
challenge
it
or
not.
he'd
have
to
amend
his
complaint
in
the
district
court.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
that
johnson
has
a
federal
habeas
remedy
here
because
the
federal
habeas
statute
is
a
challenge
to
the
legality
of
custody,
the
legality
of
confinement,
and
that's
not
anything
that
he's
challenging
in
this
case.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
i
think
that's
a
closer
call,
but
i
think
it--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--right.
and...
and
i...
i
think
it
is
still
section
1983
if
certain
things
are
present.
that
is,
is
he
going
to
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
duration
of
his
sentence
by
winning
his
case?
and
if
that's
meets
the
heck
rule
and
if
he
isn't,
then
i
think
he
can
proceed
in
section
1983.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
i
don't--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--well,
i
think
in
the
hypothetical
that
you've
presented,
justice
scalia,
if
the
prisoner
wins
the
case
in
that
particular
case,
then
his
sentence
is
invalidated,
and
i
think
that's
the
important
critical
factor
here.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
because
it's
not
a
challenge
to
the
legality
of
the
confinement.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
well,
and
i...
i
think
point
with...
with
both
of
those
decisions
is
that
the
heck
rule
did
not
come
into
play
because
the
prisoners
must
have
gone
through
and
exhausted
their
state
court
remedies,
and
so
there
wasn't
an
issue
as
to
whether
they
must
bring
their
claim
in
habeas.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
sure.
i
think
the
court
in...
in
that
particular
case--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
i
don't
think
there's
a
remedy
in
habeas
for
the
respondent
johnson
in
this
case
because
the
first
thing
that's
going
to
be
asked
when
he
goes
to
the
federal
district
court
to
seek
habeas
relief
is,
well,
are
you
challenging
the
legality
of
your
custody?
mr.
john
q.
lewis
right.
and...
and...
but
he's
not
necessarily
challenging
the
legality
of
his
custody.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
because
i
think
in...
in
the
first
hypothetical,
your
honor,
that...
that
you
gave,
the
challenge,
if
successful,
would...
would
completely
invalidate
the
sentence
that
he
received.
they'd
have
to
redo
the...
the
sentence.
and...
and
i
think
that's
the
critical
distinction
in
this
case,
is
that
when
johnson
files
his
complaint,
he
has
a
10
to
30-year
sentence
by
the...
by
the
state
court.
if
he
wins,
he
still
has
a
10
to
30
year
sentence.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
but
in
the
hypothetical
you
propose,
justice
kennedy,
the...
the
prisoner
was
actually...
would
be
actually
challenging
the
sentence
he
received,
and
by
winning
the
case,
he's
going
to
undo
the
state
court
sentence.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
is
properly
a
habeas
action.
i
think
even
in
the
decisions
where
courts
may
have
heard
similar
claims
in
habeas,
i
think
it
was
a
matter
of
just
saying,
well,
the
prisoner
is
already
here.
he's
already
exhausted
all
of
his
state
court
remedies.
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
it's
section
1983
or
habeas.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
i...
i
think
there
would
be.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
i
think
that
by...
by
having
a
rule
of
that
sort,
that
it
would
be
expanding
the
jurisdiction
of
habeas
and
it
would
start
to
swallow
up
otherwise
cognizable
section
1983
claims.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
q.
lewis
well,
because
the
congress
has
enacted
a
statute--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--absolutely
it
would.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
because
there's
a
statute
that
allows--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--it's
going
to
give
states
a
license
to
violate
civil
rights
that
will
otherwise
not
be
protected
under
the
statute.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
yes,
but
the...
the
state
exhaustion
requirements
in
habeas
are
much
tougher.
of
course,
the
state
wants
them
to
have
to
go
through
state
exhaustion.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
that's
really
the
critical--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
you
would
basically
end
up
going
to
a
federal
district
court
seeking
habeas
relief
asking
for
processes
to
be
changed
prospectively.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
that's...
that's
really
it,
justice
souter.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
well,
if
that's
the
relief
that
the...
the
prisoner
was
seeking,
i
think
that
is
clearly
a
habeas
claim.
but
that's
not
what
johnson
is
claiming
in
this
case.
he's
not
asking
for
entitlement
to
release
at
all.
he's
asking
for
the
processes
to
be
changed
prospectively
for
future
parole
hearings,
and
he's
asking
for
declaratory
relief.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
that's...
that's
absolutely
it.
he
cannot...
by
winning
his
case,
he's
not
going
to
shorten
his
sentence
in
any
way.
and
that's...
that's
a
big
distinction
from
the
balisok
case
where
there
was
an
automatic
entitlement
to
a
shorter
sentence--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--for
balisok
in
that
case.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
might
but
not
necessarily.
and
this
court
made
very
clear
most
recently
in
the
nelson
decision--
mr.
john
q.
lewis
--i
think
a
challenge
to
the
sentence
necessarily
invalidates
that
sentence
if
you
win.
but
a
challenge
to
parole
is
much
different
because
you're
not
affecting
the
sentence
if
you
win
your
case.
and
the
term
necessary
is
completely
necessary
to
the
heck
analysis,
as
this
court
made
clear
most
recently
in
the
nelson
case
from
last
term.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
that's
really
all
it
means.
and
this
court
last
term
in
muhammad
in...
in
footnote
1
made
clear
that
the
incarceration
that
matters
for
this
analysis
is
the...
in
the
incarceration
of
the
sentence
from
the
state
court.
and
i
think
that's...
that's
what
the
court
needs
to
look
at,
is
what
is
johnson's
effect
on
the
state
court
judgment
or
sentence.
what's
the
necessary
implications?
not
in
this
case
at
all.
and
really,
this
case
i
think
has
already
been
decided
by
wolff.
it's
something
that
the
petitioners
sort
of
don't
mention
too
much
in
their
briefs.
in
wolff,
the
prisoners
in...
in
that
case
were
trying
to
get
their
good-time
credits
back.
i
think
this
is
an
easier
case
than
the
wolff
decision.
and
what
the
court
did
was
parse
out,
okay,
you
can't
get
your
good-time
credits
back,
but
you
can
seek
prospective
injunctive
relief
to
fix
the
processes
that
are
used
in
connection
with
depriving
prisoners
of
good-time
credits.
and
that's
precisely
what
johnson
is
seeking
here.
your
honor,
the
other
thing
i
wanted
to
mention
was
the
notion...
your
honors,
the
other
thing
i
want
to
mention
was
the
notion
that
there's
no
state
review
of
these
decisions.
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
clearly
provides
for
state
administrative
review
of
even
challenges
to
the
process.
so
the...
the
state
of
ohio
could
easily
set
up
an
appeal
process
administratively
to...
to
correct
that
problem.
mr.
john
q.
lewis
thank
you.
