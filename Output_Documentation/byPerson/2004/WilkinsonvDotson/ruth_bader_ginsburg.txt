the
duration
of...
of
the
sentence.
and
here,
there's
no
implication
at
all
that
this
sentence
is
in
any
way
invalid,
that
the
sentence
itself
or
any
portion
of
it
is
invalid
because
the
parole
would
be
a
matter
of
administrative
grace,
but
it
doesn't...
the
determination
of
parole
eligibility
or
parole
suitability
does
not
go
to
the
validity
of
the
sentence
in
any
way,
shape,
or
manner.
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
couldn't
one
say
the
same
thing
of
prison
conditions
that
you
can
bring
in
as
a
1983
action?
the
states
know
better
about
how
their
prisons
are
operating
and
what
changes
would
have
to
be
made.
so
i...
i
think
that
you...
you
may
be
right
that
the
state
knows
more
about
how
its
parole
system
operates,
but
so
does
it
know
more
about
how
its
prison
system
operates.
and
that
doesn't...
that's
not
what
determines
whether
you
have
1983
or
habeas.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
aren't...
aren't
those
claims
moot
or
academic
now?
because,
as
i
understand
it,
he
has
had
another
parole
hearing.
so
he's...
with
the
hearing
that
he
was
seeking,
he's
already
had
another.
so
he's
not
complaining
about
the
absence
of
a
hearing
or...
or
flaws
in
the
procedure
at
the
hearing.
i
thought
that
this
case
now
reduces
to
a
clean
question
about
the
retroactive
application
of
the
new
guidelines.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there...
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
this,
but
i
thought
there
no
challenge
being
made
to
the
2002
hearing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
can't
it
simply
be
that
prospectively
for
this
class
of
prisoner,
the
old
guidelines
will
apply,
prospectively
without
undoing
anything
that's
happened
in
the
past?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
twice
you
started
something
and
our
questions
impeded
you.
but
i
think
you
were
equating
the
parole
board's
decision
to
a
criminal
sentence,
and
so
you...
you
were
saying
just
as
the...
the
federal
authority
can't
come
in
and
nullify
the
state
criminal
sentence,
neither
can
it
nullify
the
parole
board
determination.
and...
and
i
thought
that
the
comparison
between
a...
a
sentence...
a
criminal
conviction
and
sentence
and
a
parole
board's
discretionary
determination...
you
seemed
to
be
putting
those
on
the
same
plane.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
significant
difference
between
this
case
and
wolff?
i
mean,
wolff
was
a
case
of
procedural
fault
supposedly,
and
if
those
faults
were
cured,
someone
would
have
a
better
chance
at
getting
good-time
credit.
wasn't
that
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
it
seems
to
me
it's
very...
very
close
to
your
situation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
you
raise
deprivation
of
the
benefit
they
would
get
from
the
ohio
courts.
if
they
wanted
that
benefit,
they
could
have
brought
a
1983
action
in
state
courts.
state
courts
have
jurisdiction.
so
it's
a
little
odd
for
you
to
say,
oh,
they're
being
deprived
of
a
benefit
when
they're
telling
you
by
this
very
lawsuit
they
don't
want
it.
