mr.
douglas
r.
cole
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
prisoners
typically
want
two
things:
first,
to
improve
their
conditions
while
in
prison;
and
second,
to
get
out
of
prison
as
quickly
as
possible.
respondents'
claims
here
are
not
conditions
claims.
they
do
not
seek
a
larger
cell
or
better
food
while
in
prison.
rather,
their
claims
are
about
getting
out
of
prison.
traditional
understandings
of
habeas
would
suggest
that
these
release-driven
claims
lie
there,
not
in
section
1983,
and
this
court's
decision
in
heck
confirms
that
this
common
sense
answer
is
also
the
correct
answer.
in
fact,
heck
establishes
two
bars,
each
of
which
independently
prevent
respondents
from
using
section
1983
to
pursue
their
claims
here.
first,
heck
establishes
that
civil
actions
under
section
1983
cannot
be
used
to
collaterally
attack
state
criminal
judgments.
before
a
prisoner
can
advance
a
claim
under
section
1983
that
would
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
such
a
judgment,
he
must
first
show
that
it
has
been
favorably
terminated.
and
edwards
v.
balisok
confirms
that
quasi-judicial
administrative
decisions
regarding
the
duration
of
confinement
count
as
criminal
judgments
for
this
purpose.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
it's
arguably
different
than
the
good-time
credits
at
issue
in
balisok,
as...
as
your
honor
notes.
however,
i...
i
would
suggest
that
even
with
respect
to
good-time
credits,
often
under
many
state
systems,
good-time
credits
have
the
dual
effect
of
moving
up
the
parole
eligibility
date,
as
well
as
potentially...
and
in
some
states,
it
doesn't
even
have
an
effect
on
the--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--of
the
sentence.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
your
honor,
the...
the
court...
that's...
that's
correct,
yes.
and
i
guess
what
i'd...
i'd
say
is
that
what
seemed
to
be
driving
the
court,
though,
was
still
the
durational
aspect
of
the
sentence;
that
is,
as
the
court
said
in
muhammad,
if
a
claim
threatens
no
consequence
for
the
duration
of
confinement,
then
that
isn't
a...
or
that
isn't
a
claim
that
should
be
brought
in
1983.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
i'm
not
sure
it
is,
your
honor.
both
of
them
are
going
to
have
definite
durational
consequences
for
confinement.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
and,
your
honor,
as
far
back
as
preiser,
this
court
has
noted
that
challenges
to
duration
go
to
the
very
heart
of
habeas
corpus.
that's--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
a
decision
from
a
federal
court...
and
i
guess...
i
think
the
answer
to
your...
your
honor's
question
is
yes,
it
does.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
i
think
we
need
to
look
to
the
consequences
of
the
federal
court
decision
that
would
follow
from
the
claims
that...
that
the
plaintiffs...
or
i'm
sorry...
the
prisoners
here
are
advancing.
the
state
of
ohio
has
made
individualized
decisions
with
respect
to
each
of
these
respondents
that
they
should
not
again
be
considered
for
release
from
prison
until
2005.
the
request...
the
relief
that
they're
requesting
and
the
claims
that
they're
bringing,
if
successful,
would
result
in
the
federal
court
undermining
that
state
decision
with
regard
to
the
length
that
they
should
be
incarcerated.
it
goes
directly
to
the...
the--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--absolutely
no
certainty
of
that,
your
honor.
but
there
is
certainty--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
i
mean,
prisoners
could
be
released
in
the
state
of
washington
before
the
terminus
of
their
sentence.
they
might
not...
it
isn't
as
though
they
had
to
serve
all
the
way
till
the
end,
less
whatever
good-time
credits
they
had.
they
could
easily
be--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--released
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
we--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--that's
correct.
you'll...
you'll
just
get
another
hearing.
but
an
important
note
on
that:
you'll
get
another
hearing,
and
you'll
get
another
hearing
sooner
than
the
state
has
decided
that
you
should
get
a
hearing.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
yes,
your
honor,
it
could
have
been
brought
as
a
habeas
action.
if
you
look
at
the
nature
of
their
complaints,
they're...
they're
clearly
in
custody.
habeas
would
require
custody
and
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
i
think
probably
the
garlotte
case,
your
honor,
in
which
the
court
allowed
a
habeas
challenge
where
the
only
result
was
going
to
be
to
advance
the
date
of
eligibility
for
release
from
prison
incarceration.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
these...
under
that
understanding
of
eligibility,
where
eligibility
means
the
first
possible
release
date.
but
these
prisoners
are
not
eligible
for
release
in
the
sense
of
it's
not
going
to
happen
for
them
unless
and
until
the
next
release
hearing.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
i
was
hoping
for
an
i,
yes.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
i'll...
i'll
wait
and
see
what
the
question
is--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--the
state
concedes
that
if
they
had
brought
this
case
before
a
parole
hearing
at
which
the
guidelines
were
applied,
that
it
would
be
a
different
case,
and
that
1983
would
be
a
remedy
in
that...
in
that
situation.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
your
honor,
there
would
be
some
real
consequences
that
would
follow
from
that.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
the
reason
that
it's
important
that
these
cases
go
to
habeas
rather
than
1983
is
because
of
the
state
court
exhaustion
requirement
that's
attendant
with
habeas.
parole
claims
like
those
advanced
here
are
often,
if
not
always,
intricately
bound
up
with
state
law
issues,
and
the
state
law
is
often
going
to
provide
much
more
meaningful
relief
than
the
federal
law
claims
that
the
prisoners
advance.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
yes,
but
as
your
honor
is
aware,
that's
an
administrative
exhaustion
requirement
which
this
court
referred
to
in
nelson,
i
believe,
as
a
substantially
lower
gate
than
the
exhaustion
requirement
imposed
by
habeas.
moreover,
it's
telling--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--they
could,
your
honor,
but
i...
i
think
the
types
of
legal
determinations
with
respect
to
legal
entitlements
and
also
the
court...
we
would
assume
a
state
court
would
also
consider
federal
claims
that
might
be
made
by
the
prisoners
when
they
bring
their
state
court
claim.
those
types
of
legal
claims
are
better
resolved
by
state
courts.
they
have
the
expertise
to
make
the...
the
determination.
and
in
fact,
in
ohio--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
but
congress,
with
respect
to
conditions
claims...
and
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
administrative
exhaustion
requirement
in
the
plra
at
42
u.s.c.
1997(e)(a),
it
says
no
action
shall
be
brought
with
respect
to
prison
conditions
under
1983
without
administrative
exhaustion.
so
even
congress,
in
thinking
about
the
plra
and
in
thinking
about
requiring
administrative
exhaustion,
understood
that
1983
is
really
about
conditions
of
confinement.
1983
isn't
about...
it
never
has
been
about...
release.
habeas
has
traditionally
been
the
relief
that
people...
or
the
cause
of
action
that
people
bring
when
what
they're
interested
in
is
relief...
or
release
from
prison.
and
these
claims,
no
one
can
dispute,
are
release-driven
claims.
they
may
not
ultimately
be
successful
in
securing
release,
but
the
prisoners
here--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i
don't
think
you
need
to
do
either,
your
honor.
i
think
if
we
go
back
to
heck
and
look
at
the
language
there
that
talks
about
necessarily
implying
the
invalidity
of
a
criminal
judgment,
which
is
something--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--respondents
concede
in
their
brief,
the
only
question
then
is
does
a
parole
decision
count
as
a,
quote,
criminal--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
right,
your
honor,
because
the
illegally
seized
evidence
at
the
trial...
i
don't
know
that
that
would
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction
that
resulted
from
that
trial.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
right,
your
honor,
and
that...
that's
absolutely
correct,
but
i'm
not
arguing
for,
and
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
i'm
not
arguing
for
any
rule
that
would
turn
on
the
subjective
intent
of
the
prisoner
in
bringing
their
claim.
it
turns
on
the
necessary
implication
of
success
on
that
claim,
and
that's
a...
a
distinction
that
the
court
made
both
in
heck
and
in
balisok.
they
looked
to
what's
the
necessary
implication.
so
we
look
to
the
claims
here,
not
why
they
brought
them,
but
what
are
the
claims.
and
the
claims
here,
and
the
particular
ones
that
i
would
focus
on,
are
the
ex
post
facto
claims.
if
the...
if
they
have
success
on
their
ex
post
facto
claims...
and
we
don't
believe
their
claims
are
meritorious,
but
if
they're
successful
on
those
claims,
there's
no
way
the
state's
decision
can
stand.
they
are
entitled
to
a
new
hearing
at
which
they
would
again
be
considered
for
parole--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--we...
we
concede
that
if
there's
an
ex
post
facto
violation
here,
these
prisoners
are
entitled
to
a
new
parole
hearing.
and
i
guess
the--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--absolutely,
your
honor.
absolutely.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
the
way
that...
that
i've
been
thinking
about
it
is
if
you
put
the
state
parole
decision
up
on
the
wall
and
you
put
the
federal
decision
up
on
the
wall,
one
of
them
has
to
come
down.
the
federal
decision
trumps
the
state
decision.
it
can--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--no.
the
whole
thing
comes
down,
your
honor.
they're
entitled
both
to
an
immediate
new
release
hearing
and--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--if
they're
successful
on
their
claims,
they're
entitled
to
more
frequent
release
hearings
in
the
future.
so
the
decision,
the
state's--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--absolutely.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
they
have
to
decide
that
again.
that...
that
order
is
void
ab
initio.
it's
as
though
it
were
never
entered.
they
have
to
make
a
new
decision
about
whether
or
not
this
person
should...
should
have
parole
and
that
they
cannot
in
any
way...
the
state
cannot
rely
on
the
prior
decision
that
they
reached
on
that
issue.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
no,
they...
dotson's
complaint,
i
believe
at
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix...
he
wants
to,
quote,
proceed
toward
a
prompt
and
immediate
parole
hearing
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
laws
and
administrative
rules
in
place
when
the
plaintiff
committed
his
crimes.
they
want
an--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
it
isn't
a
clean
question,
your
honor,
because
exactly
the
same
error
that
he
alleges
infected
his
first
hearing
was
present
at
his
second
hearing.
if...
if
you
look
at
the
materials
that
they
added
to
their
brief
at
lines
3,
7,
and
8
where
they
have
the
new
parole
decision,
it's
clear
that
dotson's
2002
parole
decision
was
predicated
on
exactly
the
same
guidelines,
exactly
the
same
1998
guidelines
that
he
says
violated
his
rights
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
so,
in
fact,
if
anything,
it's
made
his
situation
worse
because
a
federal
decision
on
his
claims
now
would
both
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
his
previous
hearing
and
the
2002
hearing,
and
the
2002
hearing
was
a
release
hearing.
unlike
the
halfway
review
that
occurred
earlier,
it
was
a
full-fledged
release
hearing
in
2002,
at
which
the
parole
board
decided
both
that
he
should
not
get
parole
then
and
that
he
should
not
again
be
considered
for
parole
until
2005.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
but
what
heck
makes
clear
is
it
doesn't
matter
what
you
say
you're
challenging.
what
we
need
to
look
to
is
what's
the
necessary
implication
of
securing
success
on
your
claims
in
federal
court
for
a
state
decision.
here,
the
necessary
implication,
if
they're
successful
on
their
ex
post
facto
claims,
is
going
to
be
that
the
2002
decision
can't
stand,
the
1999
decision--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i
think
for
the
same
reason
that
in
balisok
i
don't
think
there
could
have
been
a
prospective
order
that
said...
said
something
like
the
method
you
have
for
choosing
decision-makers
creates
fraud,
bias,
and
deceit,
on
a
going-forward
basis
you
must
change
that
method
for
selecting
decision-makers.
saying
that
you
have
to
change
it
on
a
going-forward
basis
would
mean,
necessarily
imply,
that
there
had
been
fraud,
bias,
and
deceit
by
the
decision-maker
that
would
mean
that--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--not
exactly
on
the
same
plane,
your
honor,
but
recognizing
that
this
court
in
balisok
said
that
post-judgment
administrative
decisions
regarding
the
duration
of
confinement
also
count
as
criminal
judgments
that
are
protected
for
purposes
of...
of
the
heck
doctrine.
and
in
greenholtz,
this
court--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
your
honor,
if
this
turns
on
whether
or
not
it's
an
entitlement,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
it
seems
good-time
credits
might
be
different
from
an
entitlement
sense
than
parole.
but...
but
all
the
way
back,
in
tracing
the
cases
from
preiser
forward,
the
court
has
talked
about
duration
of
confinement,
and
certainly
no
one
can
argue
that
the
decision
here
is
going
to
have
dramatic
consequences
for
the
duration
of
these
prisoners'
confinement.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
they're...
they're
pressing
ex
post
facto
claims.
and
as
this
point...
court
pointed
out
in
garner
in
2000,
they
can
maybe
bring
those
claims
based
on
changes
in
frequency
of
parole
hearings,
but
they're
going
to
have
to
show
a
definite
impact
on
the
quantum
of
punishment
that
they
receive
as
a
result
of
that
change.
so
if
they're
going
to
be
successful
on
their
ex
post
facto
claims,
they're
going
to
have
to
show
an
impact
on
the
duration
of
their
confinement.
either
they
have
no
ex
post
facto
claim
because
there's
no
durational
impact
on
their--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--right,
but
that's
the
heck--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i...
i
disagree,
your
honor,
because
in
heck
and
balisok,
the
court
said
look
to
what
happens
if
they're
successful
on
their
claims.
so
i'm...
we're...
the
state
is
supposed
to
hypothesize
that
somehow
they're
going
to
be
successful
on
these
claims.
we
don't
agree
it's
going
to
happen,
but
once
we
hypothesize
that
they're
going
to
be
successful
on
an
ex
post
facto
claim,
it
means
they're
going
to
have
to
show,
have
to
demonstrate
a
durational
impact
on
their
sentence.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
at...
at
some
level,
i
think
there's
an...
an
inherent
and
fundamental
tension
in
their
position,
and...
and
the
coin
could
flipped
and
conversely
there's
that
same
tension
in
ours.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
but,
your
honor,
i
believe
what
makes
out
the
ex
post
facto
claim
is
an
increase
in
the
quantum
of
punishment
after
they've
committed
their
crimes.
so
they
need
to
show
that
as
an
element.
i...
i
see...
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
could.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
thank
you,
your
honor.
a
number
of
points.
i
wanted
to
start
by
responding
to
justice
souter's
question,
which
was
again
asking
about
this
need
for
entitlement
to
earlier
release
as
part
of
habeas,
and
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
in
re
braden
case
where
a
prisoner
in
alabama
was
seeking
to
challenge
a
detainer
that
had
been
issued
by
kentucky.
and
the
basis
for
the
challenge
to
the
detainer
in
habeas
was
the
fact
that
it
was
having
implications
for
his
parole
eligibility
in
alabama.
so
there,
there
was
not
going
to
be
necessarily
an
entitlement
to
earlier
release,
but
simply
a
difference
in
the
parole
considerations.
second,
justice
o'connor,
with
respect
to
your
questions
about
mootness,
the
only
point
that
i
would
add
is
that
if
this
case
is
moot
now,
it
was
moot
when
the
sixth
circuit
decided
it
as
well.
so
if
mootness
is
the
direction
we're
going,
i
think
there
need
to
be
a
decision
vacating
the
judgment
below--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--your
honor,
we
don't
believe
it's
moot
either,
and
in...
in
fact,
for
two
reasons.
first,
once
again,
it's
threatening
consequences
for
an
existing
decision,
albeit
it
not
the
one
that
was
originally
threatened
or
where
invalidity
would
be
implied
below,
but
there
is
a
new
one
where
that
would
have
that
consequence.
in
terms
of
bad
consequences,
i
think
the
single
biggest
bad
consequence
of
directing
these
prisoners
to
1983
rather
than
habeas
is
it's
going
to
deprive
them
of
the
opportunity
for
meaningful
relief
in
ohio's
courts.
the
layne
decision
in
the
last...
decided
just
2
years
ago,
three
prisoners
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
action
about
the
way
parole
works
in
ohio.
they
were
successful
and
their
case
resulted
in
3,000
prisoners
receiving--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--that's
true,
your
honor.
at
the
same
time,
this...
bringing
this...
this
case
in
1983
in
federal
court
means
that
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
injunctive
relief
on
state
grounds
under
the
pennhurst
doctrine.
so
they
are
depriving
themselves
of
a
chance
to
get
that
type
of
meaningful
relief
that
ohio
courts
are
offering
and
that
courts
in
other
states
are
offering.
the
other...
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
with
respect
to
petitioner
johnson's
argument,
his
understanding
of
sentence,
that
if
it
doesn't
impact
the
sentence,
it
can't
be
in
habeas,
would
mean
that
parole
revocations
can't
be
in
habeas
either.
a
parole...
parole...
when
you're
on
parole,
you're
still
serving
part
of
your
sentence,
as
he
understands
it,
part
of
the
initial
term
that
the
court
has
imposed
upon
you.
granted,
you're
not
doing
it
in
prison,
but
a
parole
revocation
wouldn't
impact
your
sentence.
it
would
merely
bring
you
back
into
prison
to
serve
the
remainder
of
your
sentence
rather
than
having
you
serve
it
on
the
street.
so
i
think
that
understanding
of
sentence
can't
make
sense
for...
for
habeas
purposes.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
but
to
the
extent
we're
talking--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--but
to
the
extent
we're
talking
about
duration
of
custody
or
duration
of
confinement,
again,
the
claims
here
do
have
a...
success
on
the
claims
here
would
have
a
meaningful
impact
on
the
duration
of
confinement.
this
court
in
muhammad
said...
i
think
this
is
probably
the...
the
closest
quote
on
point...
challenges
to
particulars
affecting
the
duration
of
confinement
are
the
province
of
habeas
corpus.
this
is
a
challenge
to
a
particular,
the
parole
procedures,
that's
affecting
the
duration
of
their
confinement.
or
at
least
that's
their
allegations,
and
that's
what
success
on
their
claims
is
going
to
mean.
and
because
of
those
durational
consequences,
as
well
as
because
of
the
consequences
of
success
on
the
merits
for
previous
state
parole
decisions,
we
believe
that
those
claims
are
better
routed
to
habeas
than
to
1983.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
i
think
we
can
follow
that
case
as
it's
been
reinterpreted
in
heck.
wolff
said
that...
well,
heck
said
that
wolff
was
about
challenges
that
would
not...
and
i
believe
the
language
is...
necessarily
vitiate
the
underlying
decision.
so
the
way
heck
understood
wolff
was
that
the
procedural
challenges
there,
with
regard
to
the
prospective
relief
they
were
seeking,
were
not
the
type
of
relief
that
would
necessarily
vitiate
any
decision
that
had
already
been
made.
here,
by
contrast,
the
claims
that
they're
bringing,
the
ex
post
facto
claims,
if
they're
successful
on
the
merits,
would
necessarily
vitiate
the
decisions
that
have
gone
before.
thank
you,
your
honors.
