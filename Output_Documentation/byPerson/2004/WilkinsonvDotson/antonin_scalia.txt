justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
shorten
the
length
that
they're
going
to
be
incarcerated.
there...
there
is
no
certainty
that...
that
if
they
win
this
action,
they
will
be
incarcerated
for
a
lesser
period,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
there
was
in
the
other
cases,
wasn't
there?
in
balisok.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
indeed,
but
the...
but...
but
getting
the
good-time
credits
entitled
them
to
be...
be
released
earlier.
they
might
have
been
released
even
earlier
still,
but
their
entitlement
to
be
released
earlier
was
a
consequence,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
is
no
entitlement
to
be
released
earlier
as
a
consequence
of
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
get
another
hearing
and
maybe
you
will,
maybe
you
won't.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true.
so
it
makes
it
possible
that
you'll
get
released
earlier,
but...
but
there's
no
assurance
you'll...
really,
the
crucial
question
for
me,
i
think,
is
whether...
whether
this
could
have
been
brought
as
a
habeas
action.
could
this
have
been
brought
as
a
habeas
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they're
just
asking
for
a
new
hearing.
they're
not
asking
for
an
earlier
release.
what's
your
closest
case
that...
that
would
allow
a
habeas
action
which
does
not
seek
an
earlier
release
but
just...
just
a
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
with
an
i
or
an
e?
justice
antonin
scalia
with
an
i
or
an
e?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
require
exhaustion
even
in
a
1983
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
are...
are
you
sure
that
that's
what
they
have
to
prove,
that...
a
durational
impact?
wouldn't
it
be
enough
to
show
that
they
were
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
have
the
sentence
shorter?
wouldn't...
wouldn't
it...
assuming
there
was
an
ex
post
facto
violation,
wouldn't
that
be
enough
of
an
injury,
that
they
lost
an
opportunity
to
have
their
sentence
shortened?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
a
new...
a
new
parole
hearing.
isn't...
i
mean,
it...
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
how...
how
can
it
be
fixed
except
by
giving
him
a
new
parole
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
he?
if...
if...
what
he's
saying
is
the
past
proceedings
were
invalid,
i
want
you
to
do
it
right
in
the
future.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it...
it
isn't
mooted
because
he
still
got
it
done
wrong.
the
second
hearing
was
still
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
his
claims
here...
his
claims
here
are
correct.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
say
we
don't
know
whether
the...
the
new
parole
hearing
he
got
was
still
invalid?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
we
can
assume
that
that
was
valid.
you're...
you're
willing
to
assume
that
for
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
any
case
in
which
what
was
being...
what
was
sought
to
be
challenged
in
a
habeas
action
was
not
the
duration
of
the
sentence,
but
the
procedure
by
which
the
duration
of
the
sentence
was
determined?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any...
why...
why
shouldn't
that
be
a
habeas
action?
why
shouldn't
1983
be
limited
to
prison
conditions,
which
is
what
we've
always...
and
referred
to
it
as...
as
that
in
the
past?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
not
necessarily.
he...
he's
just
saying
the
parole
hearing
i
got
lacked
due
process
safeguards.
had
i
had
those
safeguards,
i
might...
i
might...
have
been
given
a
shorter
sentence.
i
can't
prove
i
would
have.
i'm
not
challenging
the
sentence
really,
but
i
want
a
new
hearing.
i
didn't
get
due
process.
give
me
a
proper
hearing
because
i
might
get
out
earlier.
why
shouldn't
that
come
under
habeas?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
those
cases
happen
to
involve...
happen
to
involve
sentences.
this
case
doesn't
involve
a
sentence.
it
involves
an
opportunity
to
have
his
sentence
shortened.
and
if
habeas
can
be
brought
for
that,
we
would
phrase
it
differently.
we
wouldn't
say
it
would
have
to
invalidate
the
sentence.
we
would
say
it
would
have
to
invalidate
the
proceeding
that
could
have
shortened
his
sentence.
i
grant
you
we
can't
use
the
same
language
we
did
in
the
earlier
cases,
but
if
this
is
properly
a
habeas
action,
then
we...
we
can
get
some
language
to
make
it
fit.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
sentence
means
custody.
don't
you
think
it
means
custody?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
custody
you've
been
sentenced
to?
