justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
isn't
just
duration
of...
of
confinement.
i
mean,
in...
in
balisok,
what
you
had
was
a
determination
that
the
confinement
would
be
definitely
less
as
a
result
of
the...
the
good
time
scheme.
the...
the
gut
notion
behind
balisok
was
that
what
you
were
attacking
would
imply
that
the
sentence
itself
was
invalid
because
the
conviction
was
and
so
on.
we
don't
have
that
here.
what
we
have
here
is
a
scheme
that
makes
a...
a
sentence
that
is
imposed
a
more
definite
sentence.
we
know
where
in
the
range
it's
going
to
be
reconsidered.
and
however
that
may
be
classified,
it's
not
simply
a
balisok
situation.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
that
had--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
rationale
in
balisok,
as
i
recall
it.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
no...
no
question.
but
the
durational
consequence
in
those
cases
was
a
definite
consequence
of
longer
duration,
i.e.,
a
sentence
in
the
first
place,
a
sentence
not
reduced
by
good
time
in...
in
the
second
example.
here,
there...
there
is
no
such
clear
consequence.
here,
the
consequence
is
that
there
will
simply
be
a
period
of
time
before
a
sentence
already
imposed
will
be
reviewed
to
determine
whether,
in
fact,
it
will
be
shortened
or
allowed
to
run.
and
that's
different.
justice
david
h.
souter
no...
no
question
about
that.
at...
at
the
level
of
whether
there
is
a
durational
consequence,
they...
they
both
have
it.
i...
i
grant
you
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
it...
it
doesn't
advance
the
date
of
eligibility.
it
advances
the
date
at
which
the
parole
board
will
take
another
look.
the
only
eligibility
is
an
eligibility
to
take...
to
have
another
look-take
and
not
an
eligibility
for
release.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
they
are
subject
to
another
look,
they
are
not
necessarily
then
eligible
for
release.
and
i
think
that's
the
point
that
we're
getting...
let
me...
let
me
ask
a...
a
sort
of
complementary
question.
is
there
any
reason
that
these--
justice
david
h.
souter
--with
an
e.
with
an
e.
but
if...
if
you
take
my
questioning
as
a
compliment
with
an
i,
that's
perfectly
okay
too.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
see
what
it
is.
the...
the
question
is,
could
these
claims
not
have
been
brought
in
advance
of
any
application
to
these
particular
prisoners
of
the
revised...
whatever
they
were...
the
1998
guidelines?
and
if
the
answer
is
yes,
then
they
could
be
brought
at
a
time
when,
i
suppose,
habeas
would...
would
not
have
been
a
possible
remedy.
is...
is...
am
i
correct
on
those
two
points?
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
may...
may
i
just
follow
up
on
that
question?
at
the
administrative
level,
cannot
these
state
law
policies
perfectly
well
be
taken
into
consideration?
in
other
words,
your
argument
was
these
things
are
bound
up
with
state
law
issues
and
the
best
place
to
have
them
resolved
is...
is
in
a
state
forum.
they
can
be
resolved
in
a
state
administrative
forum,
can't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
the...
the
generality
at
which
you
keep
referring
to
it,
with
respect
to
conditions
of
confinement,
is
a...
is
a
higher
level
of
generality
than
anything
that
balisok
decided.
in
balisok,
the
particular
decision
was
a
decision
to
revoke
an
entitlement
to
be
released
at
whatever
the
date
the
good
time
would
give,
and...
and
that
is
a
much
more
specific...
i
mean,
that
literally
affects
an
entitlement
to
be
released.
it
is
not
merely
a
decision
with
respect
to
length
of
confinement.
justice
david
h.
souter
we...
we
don't
know
what
consequence
it
will
have
for
the
duration
of
his
confinement.
all
we
know
is
that
it
will
have
a
consequence
in
determining
the
date
at
which
the
next
look
will
be
taken
by
the
parole
board
to
see
whether
he
then
is
in
a
condition
to
be
released.
that's
all
we
can
tell.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
you're...
you're
assuming...
your
argument
now
is
assuming
that
they
are
going
to
be
successful
on
this
element,
that
you
say
they've
got
to
satisfy
later.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
whether
they
are
or
not
has
nothing
to
do
with...
with
balisok
and
heck.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
it
also...
it
also
means
that
if...
if...
assuming
your
argument
is
sound,
if
you
lose
this
case,
you
win
the
war.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
and
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
said...
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
it
would
be
expanding
habeas,
and
i'd
like
you
to
expand
on
that.
it
would
be
expanding
habeas,
i
am
assuming,
because
in
every
successful
habeas
case,
the
ultimate
remedy
that
the
court
can
order,
if
the
state
does
not
snap
to
it,
is
the
immediate
release
of
the
prisoner.
and
i
take
it
when
you
said
it
would
expand
habeas,
it
would
expand
it
because
this
would
not
be
an
immediate
release
case
no
matter
what.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
why
they
could
not
bring
habeas
in
this
case
because
if
they
won,
they
still
would
not
have
shown
anything
that
entitled
to
them
to
get
out
now
or
get
out
now
unless
the
state
within
30
days
does
something.
is...
is
that
the
nub
of
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
regardless
of
what
he's
asking
for,
if
he
got
what
he
wanted,
he
still
would
not
be
entitled
to
any
immediate
release.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
would
still
have
a
sentence
of
x
years,
and
the
question
is,
how
often
are
we
going
to
look
at
him
to
decide
when,
within
x
years,
we
may
let
him
out.
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
the
nub
of
it
i
guess.
the
fact
that
he
may
be
granted
parole
has
no
implication
for
the
validity
of
the
sentence.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
fact,
it
assumes
the
sentence
is
valid,
but
that
he
will
probably
stay
clean
if
he
gets
out.
that's
all
it
means,
isn't
it?
