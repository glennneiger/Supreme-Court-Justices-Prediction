justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here's...
here's
the
difficulty
that
i...
that
i
have.
when
i
read
your
brief,
i
thought,
well,
he
must
be
right
because
this
is
really
about
custody.
it's
really
about
custody.
they
want
to
get
out
eventually.
but
then
when
i...
i...
when
i
went
back
to
balisok,
i
thought,
oh,
here's
the
problem.
the
problem
is
that
it's
a
damage
remedy
in
balisok.
and
normally
you
want
the
person
to
go
into
1983
to
get
damages.
but
he's
going
to
get
mixed
up.
when
do
you
send
him
to
habeas?
well,
we
don't
want
to
send
him
to
habeas
unless
it's
clear
that
habeas
should
have
been
brought.
and
so
if
he's
just
challenging,
for
example,
introduction
of
fourth
amendment
violation
evidence
or
something
like
that,
don't
go
to
habeas.
don't
go
to
habeas.
you
didn't
have
to
go
to
habeas
unless
you
had
to,
unless
you
had...
unless
it
was
necessary
to
upset
the
conviction.
you
see?
that's
why
that
language
is
there.
now,
i
got
that
far.
then
i
said,
oh,
i
see
what
you
do.
we
should
have
one
rule
for
damages.
well,
that
makes
sense.
but
there's
no
reason
not
to
have
a
different
rule
when
you
have
the
injunctive
action,
and
there
maybe
we
could
follow
your
rule.
but
the
next
thing
i
come
across
is
a
statement
that
says,
no,
no,
the
rule
is
the
same
whether
you
bring
a
damage
action
or
whether
you
bring
an
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief
action.
and
i
said,
well,
why
did
we
write
that?
you
know,
we're
the
ones
who
caused
all
this
trouble.
but
the...
the...
well,
because
we
didn't
want
to
make
it
too
complicated
and...
and
not
have
all
the
questions
coming,
well,
what
kind
of
an
action
is
it
really,
et
cetera.
okay.
so
once
i
got
that
far,
i
said,
oh,
well,
i'm
going
to
have
to
change
something
for
you
to
win.
either
i
have
to
change
the
thing
that
says
the
damages
should
be
the
same
as
the
injunctive,
or
i
have
to
change
something
else
somewhere
along
the
line,
the
word
necessary.
i
don't
want
to
change
the
word
necessary.
maybe
i
could
change
the
other,
but
why
bother
really?
because
all
that's
important
here
is
people
know
which
way
they
should
go.
now,
that's
where
i
am
at
the
moment,
thinking
give
him
his
1983
action.
it's
simpler.
it
follows
from
balisok.
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no,
i've
got
that
part.
but
the...
and...
and
you're
right
about
that
part.
but
that...
you
know,
that
doesn't
get
over
the...
the
hump
here
i
think
because
of
the...
what
we've
written.
the...
i
mean,
where
i'm
coming
out
now,
what
you've
just
said,
is
well,
you
know,
there's
going
to
be
exhaustion
in
both
cases.
and
prison
conditions,
if
we
say
that
habeas
doesn't...
that
1983
applies
here
i
think
probably...
i
can't
guarantee
it...
but
those
where
prison
conditions
would
then
cover
it,
and
then
there
would
be
exhaustion,
and
there...
where
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
difference
there.
and
now
i'm
back
to
asking
the
other
half
of
this,
which
is,
well,
all
right,
suppose
i
say
i
see
your
point,
i
think
you're
right.
now,
what...
what
is
your
recommendation?
what
do
we
change?
do
we
change
the
word
necessary
in
balisok,
which
i'd
be
pretty
reluctant
to
do?
or
do
we
drive
a
wedge
between
the
damage
cases
and
the
injunctive/declaratory
relief
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
no,
but
then
what
you're
doing
is
taking
the
first
half
because
what
you're
reading
is
you're
reading
that
word
necessary,
whatever
those
words
were
in
balisok
that
we
were
just
talking
about,
as
your
case
satisfying
that
condition.
and
if
your
case
satisfies
that
condition,
then
so
does
the
case
where
a
person
wants
to
bring
a
damage
action
because
of
illegally
seized
evidence
at
his
trial.
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
because
all...
i
mean...
and
then
we've
swept...
then
we've
done...
we've
really
moved
balisok
from
what
it
was
trying
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
he
bringing
his
damage
action?
he
thinks
he's
bringing
it
because
what
they
did
at
that
trial
hurt
me.
now,
how
did
it
hurt
me?
it
hurt
me
because
i
went
right
to
prison.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you're
not
challenging
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
we
take
it
as
valid.
that's
not
a
claim
you're
challenging.
but
i
take
it
your
claim
is
in
the
year
2009
he
will
have
another
hearing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
2005?
okay,
2005
he'll
have
another
hearing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
the
year
2005,
i
want
not
to
have
the...
what
are
they
called?
the
1998
guidelines.
i
don't
want
my
1998
guidelines
applied
in
the
2005
hearing
because
you
have
some
theory,
maybe
good,
maybe
bad,
but
it's
a
theory
that
that
would
violate
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
he's
going
to
have
this.
i
want
an
injunction
or
declaratory
relief
they
can't
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he's
saying
it
violates
the
constitution
in
two
respects:
one,
they
won't
listen
to
me;
and
two,
they
apply
the
1998
guidelines.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
it.
okay.
we're
talking
now
about
this
2005
hearing
and
he
wants
new
procedures,
and
the
question
is,
is
this
1983
or
is
it
habeas?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
law
clerk
found
two
cases
which
we've
just
looked
at
briefly.
one
is
called
wilwerding
v.
swenson
and
the
other
johnson
v.
avery
where
she
says
that
in
those
two
cases
people
were
using
habeas
to
challenge
prison
conditions
even.
now,
so
there
are...
there
are
two
cases
that,
if
she's...
and
she's
usually
right...
that...
that...
where
habeas
was
used
to
challenge
prison
conditions.
so
i've
thought,
well,
if
they
can
use
it,
they
certainly
could
use
it
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it
was
a
different
issue,
but
it
said
habeas
could
be
brought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
habeas
could
be
brought
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
they
say
sure...
sure
i
am.
i'm
saying
i
had
terms.
you
know,
i
was
going
to
be
here
under
conditions
a,
b,
c,
and
a,
b,
c
in
my
opinion
mean
i
will
be
released
sooner,
and
instead,
they
gave
me
d,
e,
f,
and
d,
e,
f
means
i'm
likely
to
be
released
later.
i
can't
guarantee
it.
that's
what
he'll
say.
he
says
i
can't
guarantee
it,
but
i
wouldn't
be
bringing
this
case
if
i
didn't
think
at
least
it
was
a
shot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
we
wrote
an
opinion
that
said,
whatever
the
reasoning...
i
don't
know
what
it
would
be
right
now...
that
said
in
the
future
your
client
should
go
ahead
in
1983.
i'm
putting
you
in
a
slightly
awkward
position,
so
don't
answer
if
you
don't
want
to.
but
i
mean,
for
the
future
all
these
cases
will
be
brought
in
habeas.
now,
suppose
that's
what
the
opinion
said.
we're
absolutely
making
it
clear
just
what
the...
would
there
be
any
harm
done?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
would
that
harm
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
would
that
be
bad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
that
be
bad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but
i
mean,
is...
i'm
asking
you
a
practical
question
as
a
practicing
lawyer.
would
it
be
bad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
leaving
aside...
congress
changed
the
statute.
it
says
absolutely
it's
going
to
be
habeas.
is
there
any
bad
consequence
in
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we'll
catch
them
in
habeas.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
so
it
comes
down
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
which
arises
in
the
context
of
state
prisoners
involves
a
relationship
between
two
federal
statutes.
now
the
first
of
them
is
the
basic
civil
rights
statute
42
u.s.c.
section
1983;
and
the
second
is
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
now,
the
first,
the
civil
rights
statute,
allows
claims
by
a
plaintiff
saying
that
the
state,
the
state
defendant
in
the
individual
usually
works
for
the
state
acting
under
color
of
state
law
has
deprived
the
plaintiff
of
the
federal
constitutional
right
among
other
things.
now
the
second
allows
a
state
prisoner
to
claim
that
he
or
she
is
being
held
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
language
is
quite
similar
and
overlaps
because
obviously
it
bring
held
against
the
federal
constitution
here
being
deprived
of
the
federal
right,
but
that
is
what
creates
the
complexity.
and
it
arises
here
in
the
context
of
state
parole
procedures
as
the
plaintiff
are
saying
that
those
state
parole
procedures
violate
federal
constitutional
rights.
so,
can
the
prisoner
bring
his
claim
under
civil
right
statute
1983?
does
he
have
to
use
the
habeas
statute?
does
he
have
his
choice?
what
is
supposed
to
happen?
and
you
might
think
it
does
not
matter
what
happens
just
choose
one
of
the
other.
but
it
does
matter
because
if
he
goes
with
the
civil
right
statute
he
does
not
have
to
exhaust
all
of
his
claims
to
the
same
extent
in
state
courts,
for
example,
as
he
would
if
he
went
under
the
habeas
statute;
he
would
have
a
harder
burden
exhausting
all
these
remedies
so,
the
prisoners
would
like
to
go
under
the
civil
right
statute,
and
our
case
says
they
can.
now,
the
analysis
here
is
resting
heavily
on
precedent.
first
case
really
that
got
roses
was
a
case
called
preiser
versus
rodriguez,
and
the
court
there
in
1973
notice
that
the
language
of
the
two
statutes
both
seem
to
permit
these.
and
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
prisoner
wanted
to
get
good
time
back.
now
good
time
means
you
get
out
earlier.
well,
he
had
been
deprived
of
his
good
time
that
meant
got
out
later.
he
wanted
to
get
the
good
time
back
which
would
mean
he
would
get
out
earlier.
so
what
the
court
said
is
we
see
what
you
want,
what
you
are
trying
to
get
here
is
you
are
trying
to
get
out
of
jail
sooner
and
if
you
win
you
will,
because
that
good
time
credit
gives
you
a
right
to
get
out.
now,
that
is
what
habeas
is
about.
that
is
a
classic
habeas
case
that
lies
at
the
core
of
traditional
habeas
corpus.
you
are
challenging
the
fact
or
duration
of
your
confinement.
you
are
seeking
a
legal
shortening
of
your
term
of
confinement.
you
are
talking
about
the
very
duration
of
physical
confinement.
so,
you
got
to
go
under
habeas.
you
cannot
use
this
more
general
civil
right
statute
because
you
have
a
classical
habeas
case.
and
then
the
next
case
wolff
versus
mcdonnell,
the
prisoner
was
challenging
procedures.
we
think
whether
like
parole
procedures,
traditional
disciplinary
procedures,
and
the
court
says
you
do
not
have
to
go
under
habeas
you
can
go
under
1983
and
that
is
because
if
you
win
you
are
not
going
to
get
out.
what
you
are
going
to
get
is
more
procedure.
well,
there
were
two
later
cases
which
i
will
spare
you
heck
versus
humphrey
and
edward
versus
balisok
but
we
think
they
were
consistent
with
what
i
have
just
said,
and
when
we
take
them
all
together
we
think
they
show
with
certain
qualifications
i
also
would
not
get
into.
that
a
state
prisoner
civil
rights
action
i.e.
the
1983
action
is
barred,
and
he
has
to
go
to
the
more
exhausting
habeas
corpus
if
success
in
his
action
would
necessarily
demonstrate
the
invalidity
of
his
confinement
or
its
duration.
now,
the
actions
of
the
state
prisoners
before
us
if
they
are
successful
will
not
necessarily
demonstrate
the
invalidity
of
their
confinement
or
its
duration.
rather
if
they
are
successful
at
most
will
happen
is
they
will
get
more
parole
proceedings,
and
those
parole
proceedings
may
or
they
may
not
bring
about
their
speedier
release.
that
means
that
they
can
bring
their
actions
under
the
civil
rights
statute
42
u.s.c.
section
1983
and
they
do
not
have
to
satisfy
habeas
corpus'
more
onerous
exhaustion
requirements.
that
is
the
conclusion
the
sixth
circuit
came
to.
we
affirm.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joins;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
