we'll
now
hear
argument
in
wilkinson
against
dotson.
solicitor
cole.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
does
that
mean
the...
the
judgment...
the
order
denying
release
on
parole
is
invalid?
there
are
really
two
parts
to
it.
one,
you...
we're
not
going
to
release
you.
secondly,
your
next
hearing
will
be
at
a
later
date
than
you
want.
insofar
as
you
challenge
the
date
of
the
hearing...
the
date
of
the
next
hearing,
does
that
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
entire
order
denying
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they're
not
entitled
to
parole.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
it
doesn't
totally
invalidate
the
order
that
is
at
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
doesn't
entirely
come
down.
it
just...
half
of
it
comes
down.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
for
release.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
isn't
it
true
that
one
aspect
of
your
order
that's
under
attack
is
they
had
refused
to
grant
them
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
remains.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
only
relief
they
were
seeking
was
a
more
prompt
next
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
may
do
so.
mr.
lewis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
lewis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
untereiner,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cole,
you
have
about
4
and
a
half
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
had
one
further
question.
are
you
asking
us
to
change
anything
in
wolff
against
mcdonnell,
or
can
we
follow
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
cole.
the
case
is
submitted.
