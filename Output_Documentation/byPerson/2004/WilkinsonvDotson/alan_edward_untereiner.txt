mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
yes,
justice
stevens.
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to,
first
of
all,
go
to
the
point
that
justice
ginsburg
raised
about
the
allegations
in
mr.
dotson's
complaint.
this
case
has...
has
become
much
simpler
with
respect
to
dotson
because
any
claim
that
he
might
have
had
about
this
2000
scheduling
decision
has
been
mooted.
what's
really
left
are
claims
for
future
injunctive
relief,
for
prospective
relief.
these
are
classic
1983
type
cases.
prisoners
have
been
bringing
lawsuits
since
wolff
against
mcdonnell
alleging
that
parole
procedures
and
other
kinds
of
procedures,
disciplinary
procedures
ought
to
be
reformed
and
seeking
future
injunctive
relief
with
respect
to
those
kinds
of...
of
procedures.
in
edwards
against
balisok,
this
court
indicated
that
ordinarily
claims
for
prospective
injunctive
relief
will
not
be
barred
by
the
heck
doctrine
because
ordinarily
they
will
not
call
into
question
or
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
any
previous
decision.
so
to
justice
breyer's
question,
this
would
require
a
change
in
the
law,
and
it
would,
i
think,
fairly
substantially
cut
back
on
the
kinds
of
suits
that
have
been
brought
for
30
years
under
wolff
because
in
all
kinds
of
suits
like
this,
the
state
would
argue,
as
the
petitioners
are
arguing
today,
that
there's
some
prior
administrative
decision
that's
called
into
question
by
a
future
claim
for
injunctive
relief
with
respect
to
some
aspect
of
the
procedures
relating
to
good-time
credit
revocation
or
parole
or
the
revocation
of
probation.
so
i
think
this
would
be
a
fairly
substantial
change
in
the
law.
a
lot
of
these
claims
would
be
barred
by
heck.
the...
justice
scalia,
you
asked
the
question
about
the
habeas,
the
scope
of
habeas
relief.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
lower
courts
have
generally
held
that
habeas
is
not
available
for
these
kinds
of
claims
that
are
prospective
only,
seeking
changes
in
future
procedures.
there
are
some
lower
court
cases
that
say
that
where
a
prisoner
seeks
release
on
parole
and
demands
a
right
or
claims
a
right
to
release
on
parole,
that
might
be
cognizable
in
habeas,
but
the
vast
weight
of
authority
in
the
lower
courts
is
that
claims
that
only
seek
an...
the
right
to
a
new
parole
hearing,
the
outcome
of
which
is
completely
discretionary--
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
--i
think
there...
there
are
a
fair
number
of
cases
in
the
lower
court
where...
lower
courts
where
these
types
of
claims
for
injunctive
relief
have
been
brought
and
the
federal
courts
have
ordered,
on
a
prospective
basis,
that
the
states
conform
to
all
kinds
of...
i
mean,
wolff
is
a
case
like
that
i
think
where
the...
the
state
was
required
to
do
certain
things
in
the
future.
so
i
think
these
are
ordinary
1983
claims
for
injunctive
relief.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
yes.
mr.
alan
edward
untereiner
it
is
very
close,
justice
ginsburg.
dotson
is
essentially
making
two
claims
for
prospective
relief.
he
is
saying
that
these
1998
parole
guidelines
effectively
rescind
his
eligibility
for
parole.
at
the
time
of
his
conviction,
he
was
entitled
to
parole
after
serving
15
years.
under
these
guidelines,
he'll
have
to
wait
till...
until
32
and
a
half
years
have
passed
before
he's
eligible
for
parole.
and
he's
claiming
that
in...
in
his
next
parole
release
hearing,
which
is
in
june
2005
and
beyond,
the
state
is
required
to
apply
the
old
rules
to
him
so
that
he'll
be
eligible.
so
this
is
very
much
like
what
was
at
issue
in
wolff.
the
second
claim
he
has
is
that
he's
entitled
to
annual
parole
release
hearings
in
the
future.
again,
it's
a
future...
it's
a
prospective
claim
only.
in
the
future,
he
will
be
entitled
to
annual
parole
release
hearings,
and
the
new
rules
say
that
the
state
can
postpone
those
hearings
for
up
until
10
years.
so
on
both
of
those
claims,
he
is
seeking
changes
in
the
future,
and
these
are
classic
1983
type
cases
that
have
been
brought,
as
i
say,
for
the
last
30
years
in
the
lower
courts.
now,
the
heck
test
requires
a
showing
that
if
he
prevails
on
his
section
1983
claims,
he
would...
that
would
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
his
underlying
conviction
or
sentence.
and
i
think
this
case
is
very
different
from
the
balisok
case.
there...
there
was
a
colloquy
about
that
earlier.
i
think
that
balisok
is
clearly
distinguishable
because
the
administrative
decision
there
would
have
had
an
immediate
and
direct
impact
on
the
duration
of
the
prisoner's
sentence
by...
by
revoking
the
good-time
credits.
whereas,
here,
the
impact
is
very,
very
speculative.
justice
souter,
you
referred
earlier
to
a
durational
consequence.
the
durational
consequence
here
is
really
quite
hypothetical
and
remote.
if
he
prevails
on
his
1983
claims,
all
he
will
be
entitled
to
are
future
hearings,
and
since
parole
is
entirely
discretionary
in
ohio,
we
can't
predict
the
outcome
of
those
proceedings.
he'll
also
be
entitled
to...
merely
to
be
considered
eligible
for
parole
in
the
future.
so
i
think
that
the...
the
consequences...
any
impact
on...
on
the
duration
of
his
confinement
is...
is
really
quite
hypothetical
here
and
it
would
require
an
expansion
not
only
of
the
heck
rule
but
also
of
habeas
jurisdiction
to
resolve
this
case
in
the
state's
favor.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
sixth
circuit's
unanimous
decision
in
favor
of
dotson.
all
11
members
of
that
court
found
that
dotson's
claims
were
not
barred
by
heck,
and
this
court
should
affirm.
