ms.
laura
w.
brill
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
five
primary
reasons
why
this
prosecution
is
outside
the
scope
of
anything
congress
has
authorized.
first,
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
wire
fraud
statute
is
inconsistent
with
the
revenue
rule.
second,
it
turns
the
rule
of
lenity
on
its
head
by
allowing
the
government
to
incarcerate
petitioners
for
57
months
for
conduct
that
has
never
given
rise
to
civil
liability
in
this
country.
third,
this
prosecution
contravenes
our
national
policy
of
demanding
reciprocity
in
matters
of
international
tax
enforcement.
fourth,
the
government
acknowledged
below
that
it
cannot
bring
this
prosecution
without
disregarding
another
act
of
congress,
the
mandatory
victims
restitution
act,
which
is,
as
the
name
specifies,
mandatory.
and,
fifth,
under
this
court's
decisions
in
mcnally
and
cleveland,
the
wire
fraud
statute
applies
only
to
schemes
aimed
at
defrauding
a
victim
into
relinquishing
something
that
it
holds
as
money
or
property.
a
sovereign's
interest
in
an
unassessed
tax
claim
is
neither
money
nor
property.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
justice
o'connor,
the
government's
interest
in
prosecuting
somebody
does
not
define
the
scope
of
what
the
statute
at
issue
proscribes.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
well,
if
the...
if
the
statute
was
not
written
as
it
is...
the
statute,
as
written,
uses
the
words
"defraud"
and
the
word...
the
word
"property",
and
both
of
those
terms
are
terms
that
this
court
has
defined
very
narrowly.
in
nader,
it
defined
a
"fraud"
as--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--yes,
justice--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--yes,
justice
scalia,
that's
exactly--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--correct.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
yes,
that's
exactly...
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
there--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--by
automobile.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
right.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
i
think
it
just
evinces
what
congress
was
concerned
about
most
at
the
time,
justice
scalia,
but
it
was...
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
in
any...
any
time
that
this
country
has
endeavored
to
deal
with
matters
of
international
tax
enforcement,
it
has
always
demanded
reciprocity.
it
has
done
so
through
the
smuggling
statute,
it
has
done
so
through
the
numerous
tax
treaties
that
the
second
circuit's
rjr
decision
discusses
at
length.
and
one
of
the
points
the
rjr
decision
makes
is
that,
in
1951,
at
the
very
time
that
congress
was
looking
at
the
wire
fraud
statute
and
enacting
it,
the
senate
was,
at
the
same
time,
becoming
concerned
that
this
country
had
gone
too
far
in
extending
reciprocity
in
connection
with
its
tax
treaties
and
was
actually
evincing
a
policy
of
cutting
back
on
the
degree
to
which
we
would
assist
other
countries
in
tax
enforcement.
and
so
the
issue
is
to
look
at...
that
the
revenue
rule
must
be
used
as
a
background
principle
of
common
law
against
which...
against
which
the
revenue...
excuse
me,
against
which
the
wire
fraud
statute
is--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--well,
if
it
were
not...
if
it
did
not
serve
the
function...
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
government's
intent
is
and
what
is
in
the
mind
of
the
prosecutor,
but
if
it
did
not
have
any
effect
of
enforcing
a
foreign
government's
revenue
rule,
then,
yes,
it
would
be
outside;
but
there
are
numerous
ways
in
which
this
prosecution
does
enforce
a
foreign
government's
revenue
rule.
certainly,
it
deters
future
violations.
the
sentence
was
based
on
the...
an
estimate
of
the
intended
loss,
and
there
was
no
assessment
or
an
adjudication
in
canada
to
determine
what
the
amount
was
that
was
owed.
and
so
the
district
court
became,
essentially,
part
of
the
tax
enforcement
apparatus
of
the
government
of
canada
by
performing
that
assessment
in
the
first
instance.
and
so
anytime
that
we
impose
criminal
or
civil
liability
in
a
manner
that
affects
the
tax
policies
of
another
country,
we
are
enforcing
that
rule.
if
we...
whether
we're
requiring
compliance
with
the...
with
the
tax
rule
of
a
foreign
country
or
punishing
noncompliance.
all
of
those--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--well,
i
think
there's
a
certain
amount
of
self-protection
in
some
of
the
decision...
decisions,
surely;
but
the
real...
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
revenue
rule
is
a
recognition
that
foreign...
that
taxes,
in
general,
are
a
matter
of
policy.
they're
inherently
policy-based;
they're
not
based
on
contract
or
other
kinds
of
commerce.
they
do
not...
they
do
not
assist
in
resolving
disputes
between
private
parties.
and
often
they're
imposed...
especially
customs
duties,
are
imposed
to
disadvantage
other
countries,
and
so
the
courts
have
said
these
are
a
peculiar
type
of
law,
they
serve
only
the
interest
of
the...
of
the
foreign
sovereign,
and
there's
a
particular...
there's
been
a
particular
sensitivity
about
scrutinizing
those
foreign
laws,
potentially
declaring
them
invalid
under
the
foreign
governments'
own
laws
or
pursuant
to
our
own
constitution.
and
so
revenue
rules
have
historically
been
a
categorical
exclusion
to
general
principles
of
comity
through
which
we
might
otherwise
recognize
foreign
laws
or
foreign
judgements.
and
the
rule
has
come
to
be
so
entrenched,
and
has
been
so
well
established,
that
there's
a
whole
body
of
background
law
in
the
tax
treatise
of
our
country,
and
of
many
other
countries,
that
is
based
on
our
non-recognition
and
our
non-enforcement
of
foreign
revenue
laws.
so--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
current
restatement
is
worded
in...
addresses
judgement
specifically.
it
does
not...
it
doesn't
address
un-adjudicated
tax
codes.
but
there's
always
been
a
much
greater
suspicion,
a
much
greater
reluctance,
to
get
into
enforcing
a
claim
brought
by
a
foreign
country,
where
that
country's
own
processes
have
not
been
allowed
to
run
their
course
and
to
have
the
initial
determination.
there...
the
restate...
the
second
restatement
of
foreign
relations
law,
which
is...
was...
came
out
in
1965
and
is
closer
to
reflecting
what
the
law
was
at
the
time
congress
enacted
the
wire
fraud
statute,
says,
in
section
41,
comment
l,
"under
the...
under
the
foreign
relations
law
of
the
united
states,
courts
in
the
united
states
will
generally
refrain
from
taking
action
to
give
effect
to
the
penal
or
revenue
laws
of
other
states,
except
as
provided
by
international
agreement.
"
and
so
that...
that
was
a
statement
by
the...
by
the
propounders
of
the...
of
the
restatement
of
what
they...
what
they
believed
the
law
was
at
the
time.
now,
to
the
extent
it's
qualified,
i
think
it's
just
to
leave
room
for
the
fact
that
the
senate
can
promulgate
treaties,
or
congress
can,
by
statute,
command
that
courts
recognize
these
laws.
but
if--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--not
that--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--exactly,
justice
scalia.
if
congress
had
written
a
different
wire
fraud
statute
that
had
said,
"you
can't
have
a
scheme
to
defraud
the
revenue,
whether
foreign
or
domestic.
"
that
would
have
been
a
clear
statement
abrogating
the
revenue
rule.
but
we
don't
have
any
such
clear
statement,
and
the
terms...
the
terms
"defraud"
and
the
terms
"property"
have
to
be
read
with
the
background
rule
in
mind.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
correct,
your
honor,
because
there
wouldn't...
this
statute
wouldn't
have
been
written
to
take
that
into
account.
this--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--as
to
just
whether
an
unassessed
tax
claim--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--is
property,
the
revenue
rule...
the
revenue
rule
adds
a
boost
to
it,
but
there
are
two...
there
are
two
dimensions
to
the
property
element.
one
is
that,
as
i
said...
and
if
a...
if
a
tax
claim
is
not...
has
not
been
subject
to
an
assessment,
that
whatever
interest
the
government
may
have
in
that
is
not
in
the
nature
of
property;
it
is
simply
in
the
nature
of
law-enforcement
power
to
collect.
they...
some
of
these
revenue
rule
cases
talk
about
the
power
to--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--once
a
tax
is
collected,
once
the
government
actually
has
money
in
its
hands,
and
if
there's
a
scheme
to,
let's
say,
obtain
an
illegal
refund
through
a
tax
and...
that
would
be
a
scheme
to
deprive
a
government
body
of
money.
but
a
scheme
to
merely
evade
paying
a
tax
is
not
something
that
falls
within
the
statute,
separate
and
apart
from
the
revenue
rule.
but
the
revenue
rule...
as
a
result
of
the
revenue
rule,
it
is
also
the
case
that
no
state
court
would
have
recognized
any
property
interest
in
a
foreign
sovereign,
even
if
it
had
reached
the
point
of
a
judgement.
and
so
it
works
in
both
ways.
the--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--justice
ginsburg,
there
was
an
indictment
that
canada
issued
against
the
petitioners.
it
has
charges
under...
for
smuggling,
under
canadian
law,
which
is
customs
act,
section
159.
it
charges
unlawful
possession
of
imported
spirits
under
excise
act
163(1)(b),
disposing
of
goods
illegally
imported,
in
violation
of
customs
act,
section
155.
so
canada
has
its
own
process.
there
has...
there
has
not
been,
to
my
knowledge,
any
request
by
canada
for
extradition,
but
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
canada
does
include
revenue
violations,
and--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--that's
correct.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
yes,
i
haven't
looked
in
detail
at
the
statute
of
limitations
provisions,
but
that
could
be
the
effect.
and
we
could
be
punishing
them
much
more
severely
than
canada
would
be.
they
have
their
own
means
of
balancing
what
they
think
the
appropriate
balance
is
for
these
things,
and
certainly
the
wire
fraud
statute,
57
months
in
our--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--and
if
they
want
to
pass
a
law
that
says
that,
because
of
the...
because
there's
a
domestic--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--okay.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
no,
justice
stevens.
it's...
the
question
is
whether
you're--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--well,
the
assault
and
battery...
whatever
the
assault
and
battery
provisions
are,
you
would
be
bringing
the
prosecution
solely
for
that
purpose;
it
does
not
have
any...
the
effect
of
applying
the
assault
and
battery
statute,
if
there
was
one--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--well,
i
think
it...
in
that
case,
it
would
be...
it
would
be
far
too
attenuated
to
reach
that
conclusion.
there
could
be...
the
motive
of
a
person--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--well,
but
the
motive
of
the
person
performing
the
assault
and
battery
would
be
irrelevant
to
the
prosecution
as
to
whether
they
intended
to
do
the
improper
touching
and,
in
fact,
carried
it
out.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
the
question
is
whether--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--justice
kennedy,
the
issue
is
whether...
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
the
wire
fraud
statute.
and,
in
general,
we
presume
that
congress
had
domestic
concerns
in
mind,
not
that
we
have
incorporated
vast
bodies
of--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--the
wire...
it
is...
the
wire
communications
may
be
an
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
the
word
"any"
modifies
"any
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud--
"
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--your
honor,
the
government's
position
on
that,
i
believe,
is
somewhat
inconsistent.
the
tax...
the
tax
division
and
the
department
of
justice
u.s.
attorneys
manual
specifies
that
it
is...
they
believe
it
is
the
intent
of
congress
that
tax
matters
will
be
dealt
with
through
the
internal
revenue
code,
not
through
other
means.
there
are...
there
have
been
some
prosecutions
brought
in
the
case
of
an
illegal...
an
illegal
tax
shelter,
where
there
is
truly
an...
a
private
party
who
is
defrauded
into
giving
up
money
in
connection
with--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--well,
the
henderson
case,
which
we
have
cited
in
the
reply
brief,
is
one
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
where
judge
weinfeld
said,
when
faced
with
a
mail
fraud
prosecution
of
that
type,
this
is
outside
the
scope
of
anything
that
congress
intended.
the...
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
issue
of
money
or
property
so
that
it...
to
have
it
conceptually
why
an
unassessed
tax
claim
is
not
money
or
property.
there
is
no
allegation
that...
in
the
indictment
or
anywhere...
that
the
petitioners
took
any
money
out
of
canada's
treasury.
so
money
is
not
an
issue.
at
most,
it
was
an
effort
to
evade
canada's
right
to
collect
money,
not
any
money
it
has--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--the
statute
only
applies...
what
mcnally
said
is,
any
assistance
a
governmental
body
obtains
from
the
statute
must
be
in
the
capacity
of
property-holder.
and
so
the...
a
scheme
to
defraud
somebody
out
of
their...
out
of
a
building,
that's
traditional
property.
there's
not...
it
is
not
the
same
thing.
let's
have
an...
let's
take
an
example
of
an
interference
with
prospective
economic
advantage.
so
there
is
a
defendant
who
says
to
somebody
else
who's
about
to
get
a
contract...
i
know
my
competitor
is
about
to
get
a
contract,
and
i
say,
"why
don't
you
go
out
of
town?
"
"there's
a...
there's
a
much
bigger
contract
that
you
can
get
if
you
fly
to
michigan.
"
and,
meanwhile,
i
go
in,
and
i
usurp
the
contract
and
take
it
for
my
own
purposes.
well,
i've
interfered
with
that
person's
prospective
economic
advantage,
and
so
there
would
be
a
tort,
and
the
person
could
collect
from
me.
but
i
have
not
taken
any
money
or
property
from
that
person
that
was
in
his
possession.
and
what
mcnally
and
cleveland
plaintiffs
to
is
whether
there
was
money
or
property
in
the
hands
of
the...
of
the
victim.
and
canada's
interest...
until
there
has
been
an
assessment,
canada's
interest
is
purely
that
of
a...
of
a
sovereign.
it
is...
it
does
not
have
a
claim
to
any
money
that
is
in
the
bank
account
of
somebody
who
owes
it
a
debt.
and
the
johnston
case,
which
we've
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
your
honor,
talks
about...
this
court
talked
about
a
statute
in
which
there
was
a
boxing
promoter
who
collected
fees
for
the
boxing
match
and
also
collected
taxes
at
the
same
time.
and
the
u.s.
government
could
not
bring
an
embezzlement
action
against
that
person
for
not
paying
the
taxes,
because
those
taxes
were
not...
were
not
yet
anything
that
qualified
as
governmental
property.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
well,
your
honor...
no,
your
honor,
we
talked
about
both
in
the
petition
for
cert..
and
then
the
question--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--it
talks
about
the--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--yes.
yes,
the--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--right,
but--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--yes,
the
last
part
talks
about--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--yes,
okay.
but
to
return...
to
return
to
the
revenue
rule...
and
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
for
bringing
me
back
to
that...
the
government
has
acknowledged
that
there
can
be
no
restitution
here.
and
that's
in...
that's
in
the
joint
appendix,
at
page
106.
they
expressly
waived
it.
they
said
that
even
if
there
was
a
foreign
judgement
that
canada
was
trying
to
bring
here,
that
would
be
unenforceable.
there
could
be
no
rico
actions,
because
that's
unenforceable;
and
no
proxy
suits
on
behalf
of
a
foreign
government.
and
so
the
only
thing
that
they
say
is,
beyond...
is
not
included...
the
only
act
of
enforcement
which
they
say
is
not
included
is,
somehow,
criminal
enforcement.
and
under
section
14
of
the...
excuse
me,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
congress
has
power
to
enforce
that
amendment,
and
it
has
done
so
both
in
enacting
statutes
for
civil
recovery,
as
well
as
criminal
recovery...
criminal
punishment,
excuse
me.
and
so
it's...
the
notion
that
somehow
incarcerating
someone
is
not...
is
not
punishment
is
not
something
that
makes
much
sense
in
that
context.
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
held
that
penalties
are...
monetary
penalties
count
as
punishment,
and
also
that
injunctions
are...
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
revenue
rule.
that's
in
the
wisconsin
versus
pelican
insurance
case,
which
actually
addresses
the
penal...
the
penal
rule,
which
is
the
close
corollary.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
it
very
much
did.
the
loss
calculation
was
based
on
intended
loss,
and
so
they...
what
the
district
court
judge
did
was
estimated
the
number
of
cases
of
liquor
that
were
intended
to
be
brought
into
canada,
and
applied
that
number
to
the
amount
of
the
tax
that
canada,
he
believed,
would
have
applied
to
that...
to
that
amount.
and
that
ended
up
changing
the
sentence
from
six
months
to,
in
the
case
of
the
pasquantino
brothers,
57
months,
and
the...
and,
in
the
case
of
mr.
hilts,
21
months.
so
the
bulk
of
the
sentence
was
based
on
the
canadian
tax
law
and
our
courts
making
that
assessment.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
the
judge
made
the
sentence...
made
the
assessment
at
sentencing,
yes.
what
the...
what
the...
what
the
government
did
in
this
case
was
to
submit,
very
self-consciously,
all
of
the
issues
of
canadian
tax
law
to
the
jury.
and
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
said
this
to
the
fourth
circuit
en
banc
panel
several
times,
that
they
were
presenting
these
matters
of
canadian
tax
law
as
factual
issues
for
the
jury
to
find.
but,
ultimately,
in
sentencing,
it
was...
it
was
the
court
that
ended
up
imposing
and
elevating
that
sentence.
if
there
aren't
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
thank
you.
the
common
law
cases
universally
say
that
it
does
not
matter
who
is
bringing
the
claim.
it
can
be
the
foreign
government
or
it
can
be
another
person.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
sure.
on
the...
on
the
issue
of
the
identity
of
the
person
bringing
the
claim,
the
contract
cases,
holman
and
boucher,
stand
for
that
proposition,
and
the
peter
buchanan
case,
which
came
down
in
1950,
just
before
the
wire
fraud
statute
was
enacted...
this
was
in
the
appellate
court
in
ireland...
it
says,
"it
is
not
a
question
whether
the
plaintiff
is
a
foreign
state
or
the
representative
of
a
foreign
state
or
its
revenue
authority.
"
"in
every
case,
the
substance
of
a
claim
must
be
scrutinized.
"
"and
if
it
then
appears
that
it
is
really
a
suit
brought
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
the
debts
of
a
foreign
revenue,
it
must
be
rejected.
"
that's
at
1955
a.c.
529.
and
so
with
the...
with
the
mandatory
restitution
act,
this
clearly
is
something
to
collect
the
debts
of
a
foreign
nation.
and
the
sentencing
scheme
that
justice
ginsburg
alluded
to
earlier,
in
which
the
sentences
were
enhanced
based
on
the
intended
loss,
demonstrate
that
this
is
an
enforcement
action.
stringam
versus
dubois,
which
is
an
alberta
case
from
1992,
involving...
the
plaintiff
there
was
an
executor
of
a
probate
estate,
and
the
court
said,
"the
identity
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
action
is
not
vital
if
the
action
indirectly
has
the
effect
of
enforcing
revenue
laws
of
a
foreign
country.
"
that's
at
135
a.c.
at
page
70.
and
the
way
the
revenue
rule
has
been
cited
repeatedly
is
that
it...
what
it
prevents
is
not
just
direct
enforcement,
but
direct
or
indirect
enforcement.
and
so
it
is...
the
fact
that
there
have
not
been
criminal
prosecutions,
it
clearly
would
have
been
in
derogation
of
the
common
law
for
a...
for
england
to
pass
a
statute
saying
it
is
criminal
in
england
to
break
the
laws
of
france.
ms.
laura
w.
brill
right.
well,
it
clearly
would
have.
there
was
no
common
law
practice...
we
have...
we
have
not
found,
in
all
the
research...
and
the
government
has
not
found...
any
example
of
a
criminal
prosecution...
not
just
in
this
country;
anywhere
in
the
world...
to...
deriving
from
the
violation
of
a
foreign
government's
tax.
and
so--
ms.
laura
w.
brill
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
justice
souter.
and
the...
in
terms
of
what
the
government's
interests
are,
there
were
no
deceptive
acts
in
this
country.
the
way
the
government
gets
a
material
misstatement
is
by
a
failure
to
disclose
at
the
canadian
border,
which
only...
even
though
they
did
not
put
in
evidence
of
what
the...
that
canada
even
had
a
law
requiring
disclosure,
the
only
way
there
could
have
been
any
kind
of
material
misstatement
would
be
if
canadian
law
required
it,
not
if...
not
anything
that
happened
in
the
united
states.
in
cleveland,
the
court
was
very
clear
to
point
out...
one
of
the
reasons
to
adopt
a
rule
of
lenity
in
interpreting
the
mail
fraud
statute
and
the
wire
fraud
statute
is
because
violations
serve
as
a
predicate
for
rico
actions
and
for
money-laundering
violations.
and
so
what
the
government's
position
is,
is
that
we
should
carve
out
this
ad-hoc
exception
and
allow
wire
fraud
prosecution,
even
though
we
would
not
allow
any
kind
of
a
civil
rico
action
and
even
though
we're
going
to
have
an
ad-hoc
exception
for
the
mandatory
victims
restitution
act.
but
what
the
court
said
in
cleveland
is,
the
way
we
should
do
this
is
by
adopting
a
proper
interpretation
in
the
first
place,
not
by...
of
the
wire
fraud
statute...
not
by
having
ad-hoc
exceptions.
and
the
reference
to
prosecutorial
discretion
that
there
should
be
faith
that
the
government
will
only
prosecute,
i
guess,
what
the
government
regards
as
exceptional
cases
is
not
something
that
can
provide
any
business
involved
in
an
international
transaction
with
any...
with
any
comfort.
and
thank
you
very
much.
