but
it's
also
limited
to
vessels.
it's
smuggling
by
water,
not
smuggling
by--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--vehicles,
as
is
done
here,
so
that
we
don't
have
any
statute
that
covers
smuggling
on
land.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we
did...
if
we
did
enforce
even
a
tax
judgement
of
another
country,
there
would
be
no
u.s.
law
that
would
be
violated.
you're
talking
about
a
common
law,
no
country
enforces
the
taxes
of
another.
but,
at
least
in
the
restatement
of
foreign
relations
now,
that's
put
in
terms
of...
there's
no
requirement
that
any
country
enforce
the
tax
claims
or
judgements
of
another;
but
neither
is
there
any
prohibition.

may
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
ask
you,
ms.
brill,
something
that
puzzled
me
about
this
case?
it
is
a
rather
peculiar
use
of
our
wire
fraud
statute.
are
there
any
proceedings
going
on
in
canada?
has
there
been
any
attempt
to
extradite
these
people?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you,
when...
now
that
we're
getting
into
money,
one
of
the
things
that
the
sentencing
board
had
to
do
was
to
find
out
how
much
of
a
loss
there
was,
and
that
involved
determining
what
taxes
would
be
due
under
canadian
law.
and
did
that
increase
the
sentence?
did
the...
did
the
sentence
vary
with
the
amount
of
taxes
that
they...
we
found
due?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
judge
making
that
assessment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where?
using
a
gun
where?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
we're
concerned
about
offending
the
foreign
country,
then
isn't
the
way
to
go,
in
fact,
the
way
congress
has
gone
in
this
area,
we
negotiate
treaties?
i
mean,
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
go
the
treaty
route
are
the
kind
of
problems
that
justice
breyer
brought
up,
we
want
to
have
reciprocal
treaties.
we
want
two
things.
we
want
to
make
sure
that
it's
a
basically
fair
system
that
we're
dealing
with.
on
the
other
hand,
we
want
to
say,
"if
we
do
anything
with
respect
to
your
taxes,
we
want
to
make
sure
that
we
get
the
same
benefit
from
you
with
respect
to
ours.
"
so
never
mind
the
revenue
rule,
isn't
it
pervasive
that...
when
it
comes
to
enforcing
tax
claims,
that
the
route
that
congress
has
chosen
to
go,
and
the
executive,
as
well,
has
been
the
treaty
route?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--one
of...
one
of
the
last
interests
that
you
mentioned,
about
offending
foreign
governments,
well,
on
the
face
of
this,
it
would
seem,
the
one
that...
the
country
that's
been
done
out
of
taxes
is
canada,
not
the
united
states.
so,
we
should
help
canada,
if
it's
interested
in
collecting
revenue
from
these
people
or
trying
them
for
a
criminal
offense,
to
do
that.
it...
i
asked
ms.
brill,
have
they
been
indicted
in
canada?
she
said
yes,
but
she
said
it's...
they
had
not...
there
has
not
been
a
request
for
extradition.
is
that...
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
go
to
one
more
aspect
of
the
statute
which
i
don't
think
you've
addressed,
congress
said
that...
with
respect
to
the
wire
fraud
and
mail
fraud
and,
i
think,
other
things...
that
restitution
to
the
victim
is
mandatory,
that
it's
not
left
up
to
the
government
to
decide
restitution
or
not.
except
here
restitution
sounds
very
much
like
enforcing
canada's
taxes,
so
you
have
conceded
no
restitution.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
thought
of
the
wire/mail
fraud
statutes
as
cases
in
which
there
would
be
restitution,
and
that
suggests
that
they
didn't
envision
foreign
taxes
to
be
the
object
of
the
scheme
to
defraud.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
how
could
that
be,
because
restitution
is
to
the
victim?
the
victim
is
canada.
you
collect
congress...
or
canada's
tax,
and
you
give
it
to
canada.
is
there
any
other
kind
of
restitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
view
is
in...
somewhat
in
tension
with
your
view
that
the
common
law
revenue
rule
doesn't
stand
in
the
way
of
this
prosecution.
because
you
have
to
interpret
the
statute
in
light
of
the
general
rule
that
one
country
doesn't
mess
with
another
country's
taxes,
absent
a
treaty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
can
i
ask
you...
this
is
such
a
curious
case.
you
were
very
candid
in
telling
us
that
when
canada
put
these
astronomical
taxes
on
tobacco
and
alcohol,
that
was
almost
an
invitation
to
smugglers.
did
we
have
any
discussions
with
canada...
i
mean,
they
do
have
that
border,
which
is
rather
easy
to
cross...
about
what
we
were
going
to
do
when
they
put
the
taxes
on
liquor
sky-high?
