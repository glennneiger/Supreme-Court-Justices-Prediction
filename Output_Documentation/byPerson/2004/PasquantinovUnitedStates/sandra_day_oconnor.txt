well,
can
you
look
at
the
interest
of
the
government
as
one
of
not
allowing
u.s.
territory
to
be
used
to
carry
out
a
smuggling
scheme?
i
mean,
why
does
it
have
to
be
viewed
as
one
of
trying
to
enforce
some
other
nation's
tax
laws?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
wire
fraud
statute
dealing
with
the
use
of
communications
capacity
in
this
country
to
carry
out
a
scheme
designed
to
enable
smuggling
of
goods.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
don't
do
view
this
case
as
involving
some
attempt
to
indirectly
enforce
canada's
tax
laws...
suppose
we
don't
view
it
with
that
lens...
then
does
that
put
it
outside
the
so-called
revenue--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so
tax
revenues
are
not
property,
in
your
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
used
broad
language,
"any
scheme
to
defraud
by
means
of
wire
communications
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
