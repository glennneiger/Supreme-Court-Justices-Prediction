mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
prosecution
for
wire
fraud
based
on
defrauding
a
foreign
government
of
taxes
serves
at
least
four
distinct
united
states
prosecutorial
interests.
the
first
is
that
the
creation
of
schemes
to
defraud
frequently
spawns
collateral
criminal
conduct
in
the
united
states
above
and
beyond
the
fraudulent
scheme
itself.
here,
for
example,
one
of
the
defendants
was
charged
in
the
indictment
with
using
a
gun
in
relation
to
the
charged
wire
fraud
scheme.
second--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
the
united
states,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
crime
depended
upon
the
validity
of
the
wire
fraud
charges,
because
the
crime
was
use
of
a
gun
during...
in
relation
to
this
wire
fraud
scheme.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
what
it
tells
you,
justice
souter,
is
why
the
united
states
has
an
interest
in
enforcing
a
law
that
facially
is
written
to
cover
schemes
to
defraud
that
are
carried
out
using
the
united
states
wires.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
scalia,
i'm
starting
from
the
proposition
that
the
language
of
the
wire
fraud
statute
textually
applies
to
this
scheme,
and
petitioner's
argument
is
that,
because
of
the
common
law
revenue
rule,
the
statute
should
be
read
to
exclude
schemes
to
defraud
a
foreign
government
of
tax
revenue.
and
the
fact
that
a
foreign
government
is
defrauded
of
tax
revenue
does
not
mean
that
the
united
states
does
not
have
an
independent
interest
in
rooting
out
that
scheme
and
prosecuting
it.
in
addition
to
the
collateral
criminal
conduct
that
such
schemes
can
spawn,
the
creation
of
such
schemes
indicates
a
criminal
mind
and
a
criminal
group
that
can
turn
its
techniques
for
used...
using
to
smuggle
into
canada,
also
to
smuggle
back
into
the
united
states
or
to
victimize
other
victims
in
the
united
states.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
united
states
has
prosecutorial
discretion
to
determine
when
to
invoke
the
statute
and
in
what
interests
it
should
be
served.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute,
justice
scalia,
for
this
court
to
second-guess
foreign-policy
determinations
that
are
made--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
assume
that
everyone
becomes
a
criminal.
what
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
in
order
to
violate
the
wire
fraud
statute,
you
have
to
use
deception
in
order
to
deprive
another--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
that
wouldn't
involve
the
use
of
the
united
states
wires--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
if
one
stipulates
that
that
violates
the
wire
fraud
statute
or
that
there's
enough
conduct
that
does,
the
question
still
comes
down
to
whether
the
united
states
chooses
to
prosecute
that
case.
this
is
not
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
sure
of
canadian
tax
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
the
context
of
this
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--not
for
using
canadian
facilities
to
do
so.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
wire
fraud
statute
is
applicable
to
schemes
to
defraud,
generally
speaking.
the
questions
in
this
case
are
whether
there
is
a
common
law
rule
that
should
be
read
to
provide
background.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
this
is
a
realistic
problem,
justice
breyer,
that
should
require
the
court
not
to
read
a
statute
whose
language--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
are
a
variety
of
taxing
schemes
all
across
the
world.
the
question
that
the
united
states
has
to
make
when
it
determines
whether
to
prosecute
a
wire
fraud
scheme
is
whether
it's
in
interest...
in
the
interest--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
other
three
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
second
one,
which
i
began
to
allude
to
before
hearing
some
questions
about--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--are
that
people
who
engage
in
schemes
in
this
country
are
capable
of
then
using
the
same
techniques
against
victims
in
this
country.
the
third
reason
is
that
the
creation
of
international
schemes
to
defraud,
like
the
smuggling
scheme
in
this
case,
poses
independent
threats
to
the
united
states
government
because
international
criminal
organizations
are
particularly
difficult
for
the
united
states
to
deal
with.
and
the
fourth
reason
is
that
it
is
an
offense
to
a
foreign
government,
the
united
states
executive
branch
may
conclude,
to
allow
our
soil
and
our
wires
to
be
used
to
perpetrate
a
smuggling
scheme
against
a
foreign
government
with
the
united
states
doing
nothing
about
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
those
are
tax
treaties
designed
to
mutually
assist
the
countries
to
collect
taxes.
this
is
a
prosecution
directed
at
fraud.
the
collection
of
taxes
in
a
cooperative,
reciprocal
manner
between
governments
implicates
very
different
interests
than
the
united
states
has
when
it
seeks
to
combat
people
who
have
intended
to
devise,
or
have
devised,
a
scheme
to
defraud
in
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--united
states.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
my
understanding,
as
well,
justice
ginsburg.
and
the
pursuit
of
this
prosecution
by
the
united
states
reflects
that
when
united
states
citizens
engage
in
fraudulent
conduct
on
our
soil,
our
government
has
a
distinct
interest,
from
canada's
interest,
in
pursuing
the
prosecution
of
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
1952.
and
its
antecedents
are
the
mail
fraud
statute,
which
was
enacted
in
1872.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
type
of
prosecution
became
more
common
in
the
1980s
when
canada
greatly
increased
its
taxes
on
importation
of
tobacco
and
alcohol.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
before--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
think
the
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
of
course
there
were
smugglers
before
then,
but
the
statute,
on
its
face,
is
broad.
and
the
only
justification...
the
only
two
justifications
for
seeking
to
read
it
narrowly
are,
first,
that
there's
a
common
law
revenue
rule
that
forms
a
backdrop
for
the
construction
of
the
statute.
that
is
wrong,
the
government
submits,
because
there
is
no
common
law
revenue
rule
that
has
ever
been
articulated
that
says
one
country
cannot
prosecute
people
in
that
country
for
defrauding
a
foreign
government
of
tax--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
second
reason
is
the
claim
that
to
deprive
a
foreign
government
of
money
by
not
paying
tax
revenues
is
not
common
law
fraud.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
if
the
court
concluded
that
the
question
was
not
susceptible
of
resolution
by
resort
to
the
usual
tools
of
statutory
construction,
then
you
would
apply
the
rule
of
lenity.
but
it's
our
submission
that
neither
of
these
two
theories--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
it
would
not,
justice
stevens,
and
that's
because
of
the
precise
distinction
that
i
drew
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question.
this
is
a
suit
by
the
united
states
government,
as
plaintiff,
not
by
a
foreign
government,
as
plaintiff
or
prosecutor.
the
revenue
rule
is
essentially
concerned
with
interests
of
sovereignty.
one
foreign
government
should
not
be
able
to
come
into
our
courts
and
enforce
its
sovereign
power
by
using
our
courts
to
collect
taxes
from
our
citizens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
breyer,
first
of
all,
the
complexity
of
foreign
tax
law
is
something
that
would
defeat
a
federal
prosecution
in
which
we
need
to
show
specific
intent
to
defraud
if
the
law
were
not
sufficiently
clear
for
us
to
be
able
to
meet
that
burden.
this
case
illustrates
the
kind
of
prosecution
that
will
be
brought.
there
are
taxes
that
are
due
upon
the
importation
of
alcohol.
the
petitioners
arranged,
through
the
wires,
to
bring
alcohol
from
maryland
up
to
new
york,
and
then
they
got
it
across
the
border
by
not
answering
questions
when
asked
by
customs
officials
and
by
not
going
to
secondary
inspection
when
they
were
asked.
in
order
to
bring
a
criminal
prosecution
that
requires
specific
intent
to
defraud,
the
government
is
not
going
to
be
relying
on
obscure
systems.
as
to
the
concern
about
the
enforcement
of
tax
systems
that
the
united
states
may
believe
are...
is
unfair,
that
is
the
prerogative
of
the
executive
branch
to
determine
in
deciding
whether
a
prosecution
should
be
brought
in
a
particular
case.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
the
executive
branch
is
the
preeminent
branch
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
ginsburg,
the
syllogism
doesn't
track,
because
the
entire
scope
of
the
revenue
rule,
as
defined
in
the
common
law
cases
that
can
be
pointed
to
as
the
background
principle,
has
to
do
with
a
foreign
government,
or
someone
acting
on
its
behalf,
coming
into
this
country's
courts
to
enforce
its
tax
rules.
here
what
you
have
is
the
united
states
government
determining
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
to
bring
a
criminal
prosecution.
now,
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor
did
concede
below
that
restitution
was
not
appropriately
ordered.
that's
not
the
position
of
the
united
states.
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
restitution
under
the
mandatory
statute
should
be
ordered
and
it
does
not
infringe
the
revenue
rule.
but
there
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
there
isn't,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
revenue
rule
isn't
of
such
a
broad
scope
that
it
applies
to
efforts
by
the
united
states
government
to
secure
punishment
by...
for
a
criminal
conviction.
but,
justice
ginsburg,
if
the
court
were
to
disagree
with
that
and
were
to
believe
that
restitution,
even
when
it's
been
sought
by
the
united
states...
not
by
a
foreign
government,
in
its
own
right,
with
the
power
to
instigate
a
lawsuit...
but
that
even
when
the
united
states
does
it,
that
somehow
falls
within
the
parameters
of
the
common
law
revenue
rule,
then
the
answer
to
that
problem
would
be
to
interpret
the
restitution
statute
against
the
background
of
the
revenue
rule,
not
to
interpret
the
wire
fraud
statute
against
the
background
of
the
revenue
rule
and
hold
that
a
prosecution
by
the
united
states
is
wholly
barred.
the
petitioner's
submission
here
is
really
rather--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there's
a
difference--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there's
a
difference,
justice
scalia,
between
an
ambiguous
statute
and
a
broad
statute.
the
wire
fraud
statute
is
unequivocally
broad,
and
it
has
been
so
interpreted.
it's
not
ambiguous
on
the
question
of
whether
it
applies
to
schemes
to
defraud
that
may
involve
foreign
victims;
it
says
"any
scheme
to
defraud".
and
i
think,
as
justice
kennedy's
questions
pointed
out
earlier,
if
there
were
a
scheme
to
defraud
a
foreign
business
interest
in
canada
or
a
foreign
governmental
interest
in
canada
relating
to
some
commercial
venture,
the
wire
fraud
statute
would
apply,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--here
is
how
i
get
out
of
it,
justice
scalia.
if
you
think,
as
i
do
not,
that
the
revenue
rule
would
bar
restitution
at
the
behest
of
the
united
states
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
there
is
a
background
principle
that
says
when
there
is
an
established
rule
of
the
common
law,
congress
legislates
against
that
background,
and
unless
it
makes
its
intent
clear
and
unequivocal
to
overcome
that
background
rule
of
the
common
law,
then
the
statute
will
not
be
interpreted
to
be
in
derogation
of
it.
it
was
that
principle
that
formed
the
basis
for
the
government's
view
that
canada
cannot
come
in
under
the
rico
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
there
is
no
common
law
rule
that
one
country
doesn't
"mess
with"
another
country's
taxes.
what
there
are,
are
a
set
of
cases
that
deal
with
specific
problems
in
which
foreign
taxes
were
at
issue.
and
in
all
of
the
20th
century
versions
of
this
problem,
what
you
had
is
a
foreign
government
or
an
entity,
acting
at
the
behest
of
a
foreign
government,
coming
into
another
country
seeking
to
use
that
country's
courts
to
enforce
its
own
tax
rules.
and
in
that
context,
the
justifications
for
saying
that
one
country
will
not
enforce
another
country's
revenue
laws
have
to
do
with
the
sovereignty
interests
of
the
host
country.
one
country,
when
it
seeks
to
obtain
revenue
to
carry
out
its
own
governmental
policies,
is
doing
something
fundamental
to
its
sovereign
existence,
and
there's
no
obligation
of
the
united
states
to
assist
the
foreign
government
in
using
its
court
system
to
achieve
those
independent
sovereign
aims.
no
prohibition
on
it,
either.
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
it's
not
constitutional,
if
congress
wanted
to
allow
it.
but
countries,
historically,
have
not.
and
that
principle
does
form
an
important
backdrop--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
that's
essentially
the
same
question
in
this
case,
with
the
one
significant
difference
that
here
there
is
a
domestic--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
know
what
scholars
would
have
said
about
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
this
is
what
i
would
say
about
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
when
you're
dealing
with
the
principle
that
a
statute
of
the
united
states
will
not
be
construed
to
be
in
derogation
of
a
common
law
unless
it's
clear
that
that's
its
purpose,
the
court
should
be
very
careful
in
defining
what
the
parameters
of
the
common
law
are.
the
court
should
not
take
a
common
law
rule
and
treat
it
as
some
dynamic
entity
that
has
capability
of
growing
a
dimension
that
is
not
consistent
with
its
purposes
and
that
it
had
never
assumed
in
any
decided
case
as
a
means
of
telling
congress,
"you
can't
do
what
you
have
done.
"
so
i
would
say,
justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
only
reason
you
would
say
that
congress
hasn't
done
it,
justice
scalia,
is
if
you
concluded
that...
and
i
would
ask
the
petitioners
what
their
best
citations
are,
because
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
them...
what
cases
indicate
that
a
country
cannot
bring
the
kind
of
prosecution
that
the
united
states
did
here
to
vindicate
its
own
independent
sovereign--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
would
probably
be
in
derogation
of
a
more--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--fundamental
principle.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
the
revenue
rule--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
a
more
fundamental
principle
that
one
country
usually
does
not
legislate
with
respect
to
extraterritorial
acts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
if
you--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
that's
not
applicable
here,
either,
justice
breyer,
because
the
crime
involves
wire
fraud
in
the
united
states.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
souter,
again,
to
say
that
it's
in
derogation
of
the
common
law
principle
assumes
that
the
common
law
principle
has
applicability
to
one
country
seeking
to
vindicate
interests
of
its--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--because
the
derogation
that
i
was
talking
about
with
respect
to
justice
breyer
is
punishing
conduct
that
occurs
entirely
extraterritorially.
this
is
not
conduct
that
occurs
entirely--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
souter,
i
think
that
the
policies
underlying
the
revenue
rule
are
narrower
than
the
ones
that
you
have
articulated;
but,
even
more
to
the
point,
they
are
not
justifications
that
found
their
way
into
any
holdings
that
would
leave
a
reasonable
legislator
in
1952,
when
the
wire
fraud
statute
was
enacted,
to
conclude
that
this
is
a
rule
that
i'm
going
to
have
to
specifically--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
but
what
i
would
say
about--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
revenue
rule
is
that
it
is
a
shrinking
principle
of
the
common
law,
not
one
that
has
been
growing.
it
originally
started
out
as
a
principle
that
allowed
countries
to
avoid
invalidating
contracts
that
they
believed
were
in
furtherance
of
commerce.
it
gradually
came
under
attack,
because
what
it
said
is
that
the
united
states
will
not
notice
that
a
foreign
country's
laws
have
been
violated
in
the
formation
of
a
contract,
and
so
the
contract
will
be
enforced.
commentators
recognized
that
that
was
contrary
to
principles
of
comity
and
recognition
that
each
country
does
have
a
reciprocal
interest
in
acknowledging
each
other's
laws.
in
the
20th
century,
those
contract
cases
completely
drop
out
of
the
picture,
and
what
becomes
left
are
sovereignty
cases
where
a
country
is
seeking
to
exert
its
sovereign
power
inside
the
united
states
or
inside
a
foreign
country...
the
united
states,
itself,
tried
it
once
in
canada...
to
collect
taxes.
and
countries
said,
"we're
not
going
to
do
that.
"
"we're
going
to
leave
it
to
the
treaty
process.
"
but
the
rationales
that
justice
breyer
and
justice
souter
have
articulated,
about
complexity
of
foreign
law
and
odious
foreign
tax
systems,
have
never
been
the
driving
force
behind
the
revenue
rule.
it's
been--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
you
have
instead
is
a
law
of
the
united
states
that's
enacted
to
serve
perfectly
valid
interests
that
the
united
states
government
has
in
rooting
out
fraud
in
this
country
and
in
dealing
with
schemes
to
defraud
that
are
created
here.
and
for
the
court
to
say
that,
"we
don't
like
these
kinds
of
prosecutions,
because
we're
concerned
about
really
bad
foreign
tax
systems,
and
we're
concerned
about
complicated
law,
and
we're
concerned
that
some
common
law
rule
that
had
never
actually
assumed
the
scope
that
petitioners
ascribed
to
it,
should
be
formed...
read
as
the
background
principle
for
the
interpretation
of
this
statute.
"
is
not
a
principle
that
finds
any
support
in
the
construction
of
federal--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
am
not
aware,
justice
ginsburg,
of
what
specific
law
enforcement
conversations
occurred,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
there
is
extensive
law
enforcement
cooperation
with
canada,
as
a
close
neighbor,
and
that
the
interests
of
the
united
states
very
much
do
favor
our
policing
against
smuggling
here,
and
canada
policing
against
smuggling
there.
thank
you.
