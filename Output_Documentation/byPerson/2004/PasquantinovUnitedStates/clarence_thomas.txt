justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
plot
to
defraud
a
foreign
government
of
tax
revenue
violates
the
federal
wire
fraud
statute.
the
case
arises
out
of
a
scheme
the
petitioners
concocted
to
smuggle
liquor
from
the
united
states
into
canada.
petitioners
carl
and
david
pasquantino
used
u.s.
interstate
wires
to
arrange
for
the
shipment
of
discount
liquor
from
stores
in
maryland
and
to
canada.
under
the
scheme
the
pasquantino’s
employees
including
petitioner’s
hilts
drove
the
goods
across
the
canadian
border
without
paying
canadian
excise
taxes
due
on
the
liquor.
the
federal
government
brought
a
wire
fraud
prosecution
against
the
petitioners
for
their
participation
in
this
plot.
petitioners
moved
to
dismiss
the
case
against
them
on
the
ground
that
their
conduct
did
not
violate
the
wire
fraud
statute.
the
district
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
however,
both
concluded
that
petitioner’s
conduct
violated
the
wire
fraud
statute.
we
agree,
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment.
we
conclude
that
petitioners
committed
wire
fraud.
the
wire
fraud
statute
criminalizes
using
interstate
wires
to
effect
“any
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud
or
for
obtaining
money
or
property
by
means
of
false
or
fraudulent
pretenses,
representations,
or
promises.”
this
accurately
describes
petitioners'
conduct
because
petitioners
used
u.s.
wires
to
execute
a
plan
to
deprive
the
canadian
government
of
taxes
legally
due
on
to
smuggled
liquor.
petitioners
advanced
two
arguments
for
why
they
did
not
commit
wire
fraud
both
of
which
we
reject.
first,
they
contend
that
canada’s
entitlement
to
tax
revenue
is
not
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
wire
fraud
statute.
we
disagree.
canada’s
right
to
tax
revenue
is
a
valuable
entitlement
to
money
such
valuable
entitlements
are
property
as
that
term
is
ordinarily
employed
and
have
traditionally
been
considered
property.
second,
petitioners
argue
that
we
should
read
an
implicit
exception
into
the
wire
fraud
statute
for
schemes
that
aim
at
depriving
foreign
governments
of
tax
revenues.
they
based
this
argument
on
the
common-law
revenue
rule
which
traditionally
precluded
courts
from
enforcing
the
tax
laws
of
foreign
sovereigns.
we
also
reject
this
contention.
petitioners
are
correct
that
this
prosecution
enforces
canadian
revenue
law
in
an
attenuated
and
indirect
sense.
however,
we
may
read
implicit
exceptions
into
the
statute
based
only
on
firmly
established
common
law
principles,
and
no
firmly
established
revenue
rule
principle
bars
this
prosecution.
our
review
of
revenue
rule
jurisprudence
set
forth
a
more
detail
in
our
opinion,
shows
that
the
revenue
rule
did
not
plainly
preclude
a
domestic
sovereign
from
enforcing
a
domestic
criminal
statute
to
punish
domestic
conduct,
even
if
the
prosecution
has
the
incidental
effect
of
enforcing
a
foreign
sovereign’s
revenue
laws.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
joins
in
full
and
in
which
justice
scalia
and
justice
souter
joins
as
to
parts
2
and
3.
