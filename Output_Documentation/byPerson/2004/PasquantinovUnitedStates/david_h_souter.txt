justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
really
doesn't
get
you
anywhere,
does
it?
i
mean,
if
the
united
states
says,
"we
don't
want
this
gun
offense
to
be
prosecuted
unless
there's
a
wire
fraud
prosecution.
"
that
doesn't
tell
you
anything
as
to
whether
there
ought
to
be
a
wire
fraud
prosecution.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
files
it
electronically.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
why
is
it
ethical,
to
the
extent
that
there
seems
to
be
a
mandatory
obligation
to
order
restitution?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
restitution
that
would
be
ordered
would
be
just
as
much
in
derogation
of
the
common
law
principle
as
the
out-and-out
collection
in
justice
breyer's
example.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
i...
a
moment
ago,
you
said,
"okay,
we'll
assume
that
there
would
be
some
derogation.
"
in
justice
breyer's
example.
i
don't
see
why
you
don't
come
to
the
same
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
restitution
aspect
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
the
revenue...
the
revenue
rule
does
not
rest
simply
on
the
rationale
of
non-extraterritorial
enforcement.
it
has...
it
has
other
rationales:
difficulty
of
understanding
what
the
revenue
rule
is;
the...
you
know,
the
problems
of
policy;
there
are
lots
of
revenue
rules
in
foreign
countries
that
we
certainly
wouldn't
want
to
enforce,
and
so
on.
it's
not
just
extraterritoriality.
in
those...
those
policies
would
be
just
as
much
implicated
by
the...
by
the
restitution
as
by
the
out-and-out
enforcement
in
justice
breyer's
example.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
was
going
to
say,
perhaps
there
were
no
specific
holdings,
because
it
would
have
been
regarded
as,
kind
of,
a
bizarre
derogation
of
the
rule
in
the
first
place.
nobody
had
dreamed
up
this
scheme
earlier.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying,
in
effect,
that
derogation
is
an
effects
test,
not
an
intent
test.
