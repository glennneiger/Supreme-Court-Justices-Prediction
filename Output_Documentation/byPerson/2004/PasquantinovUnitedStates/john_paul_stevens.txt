justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
the
case
of
pasquantino
against
the
united
states.
ms.
brill?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the...
instead
of
a
wire
fraud
case,
it
was
assault
and
battery?
supposing
the
canadian
revenue
agent
got
inside
of
new
york
and
one
of
your
clients
beat
him
up,
would
we
have...
solely
because
he
was
mad
at
him
for
trying
to
interfere
with
his
attempt
to
smuggle
into
canada...
would
we
have
to
say
that
you
can't
do
that,
we
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
assault
and
battery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
purpose
would
be
just
what
the
purpose
is
here,
they're
trying
to,
you
know,
facilitate
the
smuggling
operation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
interfere
with
canadian's
collection
of
their
taxes.
that's
the
only
reason
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that
any
more
attenuated
than
a
conspiracy
carried
out
down
here
in
maryland
using
american
assets
to
do
the
evil
deed
in
canada?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
brill,
is
this
the
same
thing
if
it
were
a
building
fraud?
suppose
there
were
contractors
building
a
canadian
building
for
the
canadian
government
and
they
had
a
big
fraud
scheme
down
here,
and
it
was
to
deprive
the
canadian
government
of
money?
i
think
the
statute
would
clearly
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
brill,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
treated
the
argument
that
this
was
not
property
as
entirely
separate
from
the
revenue
rule
question.
and
i
thought
your
petition
for
cert
was
confined
to
the
first
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
question,
itself,
doesn't
refer
to
the
property
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
i'm
sorry,
you're
right.
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument,
you
said
there
were
four
federal
interests
you
were
going
to
identify.
you've
been
able
to
identify
one...
you
know,
on
running
around
with
guns.
what
are
the
other
three?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
were
asked
a
brief
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
think
you
have
conceded,
in
a
footnote...
and
maybe
you're...
almost
conceded...
that
if
this
were
a
rico
case,
a
civil
rico
case,
that
the
congress
enacted
the
rico
statute
against
this
background
rule
and
that
perhaps
the
rico
case
could
not
go
forward.
what
if
it
were
a
federal
rico
case
and...
the
same
facts...
would
the
rico
statute
be
qualified
by
the
revenue
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
ms.
brill,
you
have
four-and-a-half
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just
ask
you
to
tell
us
what
your
strongest
case
is?
because
they
did
raise
that
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
