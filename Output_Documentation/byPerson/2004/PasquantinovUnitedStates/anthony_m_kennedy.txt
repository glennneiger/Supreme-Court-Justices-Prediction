is
the
rationale
for
the
rule
that
enforcement
of
taxes
is
so
unpopular
that
we
want
to
minimize
the
exposure
to...
of
our
judges
so
that
they...
the
only
thing
they
have
to
do
is
enforce
taxes
that...
paid
to
our
own
government?
i'm
serious
about
that?
is
that
the
rationale?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
would
come
to
that
conclusion
even
if
we
had
a
reciprocal
enforcement
agreement.
if
this
were
country
x,
where
we
did
have
a
reciprocal
enforcement
agreement,
you'd
come
to
the
same
conclusion,
no
prosecution
under
this
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
in
a
sense,
the
revenue
position
is
irrelevant
to
your...
to
your
secondary
or
your...
or
your
independent
argument
on
statutory
construction.
the
revenue
rule
is
irrelevant
to
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
the
government
has
an
interest
in
saying,
"look,
if
you're
going
to
smuggle,
have
your
scheme
up
there
in
canada;
don't
use
our
wire
systems
for
fraudulent
purposes.
"
"we
don't
like
that
here.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they...
of
course,
they
say
that
this
covers
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
really
the...
that
turns
on
the
definition
of
"property"--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
is
an
arguable
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
the
motive
irrelevant
here?
we
don't
want
our
facilities
to
be
used
for
criminal
activities--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--any
more
than
in
the...
in
the
hypothetical
we
don't
want
citizens
beaten
up
on
our
soil.
