justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
brill,
i
thought
your
brief
said
that
we
have
an
anti-smuggling
statute,
which
is
directed
precisely
against
smugglers,
but
it
only
applies
to
those
countries
that
have
similar
protection
for
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
canada
does
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
existence
of
that
statute
would
seem
to
suggest...
and
a
statute
which
is
limited
to
countries
that
will
do
the
same
for
us...
would
seem
to
suggest
that
we
don't
want
to
do
this
for
canada.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
something
better
about
reciprocity
for
vessels
and
not
reciprocity
for
land
smuggling?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't...
you
don't
assert
that
this...
that
it...
that
this
couldn't
be
done,
do
you?
you
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--assert
that
we
shouldn't
assert
that
we
shouldn't
interpret
this
statute
to
have
done
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
presumably,
if
we
punish
this
person
this
way,
canada
wouldn't...
there's
no
double
jeopardy,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we'd
be
punishing
this
person
for
violating
canadian
law,
and
then
canada
would
punish
this
person
for
violating
canadian
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
statute
applied
against
people
who
defraud
the
united
states
government
in
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't...
you
don't
know
of
any
prosecutions
under
this
fraud
statute
for
depriving
the
federal
government
of
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it...
was
it
phrased
the
same
way
it
is
in
your
brief,
in
the
petition?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
the
last
part
of
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--obviously
covers
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
didn't
you
prosecute
him
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's...
but
that's
a
reason
for
extending
the
statute
to
everything.
to
everything.
justice
antonin
scalia
"property"
can
mean
anything
at
all.
i
mean,
what
you're
saying
is,
the
broader
you
read
this
statute,
the
more
bad
guys
we're
going
to
catch.
i'll
stipulate
that.
of
course
it's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
evading
a
cuban
tax
law
that
we
think...
that
many
people
would
think
is
an
unjust
tax
law?
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
i'm
worried
about
is
that
this
gets
us
into
foreign
policy.
are
you
sure
that
we
always
want
to
enforce
the
tax
laws
of
foreign
countries
through
this
fraud
statute,
no
matter
what
those
tax
laws
happen
to
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
well,
but
when
it
comes
here,
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
decide...
we'll
just
approve
whatever
you
want
to
prosecute
and
let
you
not
prosecute
whatever
you
want?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
comes
down
to
whether
this
statute,
which
doesn't
have
to
be
read
that
way,
ought
to
be
read
that
way,
whether
it
makes
sense
to
read
it
that
way.
what
about...
does
canada
have
an
income
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
assume--
justice
antonin
scalia
--canada
has
an
income
tax.
would
you...
would
you
prosecute
a
canadian
who
files
a
deceptive
canadian
income
tax
return?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
from
this
country.
he's...
you
know,
he's
a
snow
goose
and
is
in
florida
when
he
files
his
return.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
second--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
long
has
this
statute
been
on
the
books,
this
wire
fraud
statute?
pretty
old
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
prosecutions
like
this
have
there
been?
when
was
the
first
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
for,
you
know,
using
the
mails
or
interstate
commerce
to
defraud
a
foreign
government
of
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
more
common,
or
didn't
exist
at
all
before
the
19...
do
you
know
of
any
case
before--
justice
antonin
scalia
--before
the
1980s.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
that
suggest
to
you
that
the
statute
isn't
naturally
read
to
cover
stuff
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
didn't
have
smugglers
before
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
second
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
and
you
have
arguments
against
both
of
those
two?
which
are
arguments
are
at
least...
at
least...
arguable?
what
about
the
third
rule,
the
rule
of
lenity?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we...
if
we
are
unsure,
if
it's
a
close
question
whether
it's
property,
if
it's
a
close
question
whether
we're
enforcing
the
tax
laws
of
canada
by
prosecuting
somebody
for
violating
the
tax
laws
of
canada,
if
that's
a
closed
question,
why
doesn't
the
rule
of
lenity
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
restitution
statute
is
not
ambiguous
at
all;
whereas,
this
statute
has
a
number
of
ambiguities
in
it.
and
if
i
had
to
find
my
way
out
of
the
restitution
problem,
i
would
pick
the
ambiguous
statute
to
get
out,
rather
than
simply
saying,
"well,
though
this
restitution
statute
says
this
categorically,
we
will
ignore
it,
because
if
we
didn't
ignore
it,
we
would
be
enforcing
the
revenue
laws
of
another
country.
"
there's
nothing
against
enforcing
the
revenue
laws
of
another
country,
if
we
want
to;
this
is
just
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
should
this
ambiguous
statute
be
interpreted
that
way?
if
congress
said,
"we're
going
to
enforce
canada's
tax
laws.
"
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you
have
two
statutes.
one
of
them
seems
to
be
quite
ambiguous.
the
other
one
is
categorical,
you
get
restitution
in
all
cases.
now,
how
do
i
wiggle
out
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--obviously,
i
wiggle
out
of
it
with
the
ambiguous
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
haven't
told
me...
you
haven't
told
me
how
you
get
out
of
the
restitution
statute.
there's
no
ambiguity
there,
and
it
is
not
a
rule
of
law
that
you
can't...
it's
unconstitutional
to
enforce
the
tax
laws
of
canada.
since
it's
entirely
feasible,
and
since
the
text
is
categorical,
how
do
you
get
out
of
the
restitution
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
haven't
told...
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
we're
not
telling
congress,
"you
can't
do
what
you
have
done.
"
we're
saying,
"congress
hasn't
done
this".
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
perhaps--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
about
to
say
the
same...
the
same
thing.
you
keep
saying
there
are
no
cases
that
do
this.
are
there...
are
there...
are
there
cases,
before
1980,
which
do
what
you
want
to
do...
that
is,
to
use
our
fraud
law,
or
something,
to
effectively
enforce
canada's...
or
some
foreign
country's
tax
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
