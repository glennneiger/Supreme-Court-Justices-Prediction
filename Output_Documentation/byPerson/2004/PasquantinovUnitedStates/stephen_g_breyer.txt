well,
not
just
foreign
policy.
the
white
russians
come
here
because
they
don't
want
to
pay
lenin's
taxes
designed
to
equalize
all
individuals,
in
terms
of
property.
country
a
has
a
tax
law
that
makes
everybody
a
criminal
because
nobody
really
ever
pays
all
the
taxes.
country
c
has
a
set
of
laws
that
tax
bibles.
country
d
has
a...
i
mean,
you
know,
we
can
spin
out
the
examples
endlessly,
and
they're
not
farfetched.
so
take
all
the
arguments
from
last
week,
called
"any
court
arguments",
cross...
or
two
days
ago...
just
let's
cross-reference
them.
the
problem
is
complexity
of
tax
law.
the
problem
is
many,
many,
many
would
be
contrary
to
american
policy.
and
the
problem
is,
nobody
really
knows
what
they
are;
indeed,
they
don't
even
know
what
american
tax
law
is,
no
single
individual,
i
suspect.
let's
put
in
italy,
france,
byelorussia,
belarus,
ukraine,
saudi
arabia,
and
35,000
others.
everybody
becomes
a
criminal.
and
then
we
say,
"don't
worry,
we'll
only
prosecute
the
real
bad
ones.
"
that's
the
argument,
i
think,
on
the
other
side,
and
i'd
like
to
hear
your
perspective.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
only
people
who
come
over
here
because
they
don't
want
to
pay
taxes
in
those
countries.
sometimes
we
would
agree
with
them--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
they
don't
tell
lenin
that
they're
coming--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
they
write
to
each
other.
they
have
a
cousin,
in
brooklyn,
who
forwards
them
the
money
to
get
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
question
comes
down
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--reason
for
it.
i
just...
you
don't
seem
to
know
completely
about
canadian
law.
how
much
do
you
know
about
the
tax
law
of
vietnam?
because
los
angeles
is
filled
with
vietnamese
refugees,
many
of
communities
of
such
people
in
the
united
states.
do
we
know
how
many
of
them
perhaps
might
owe
taxes
under
the
law
of
vietnam,
and
maybe
are
talking
to
each
other
about
whether
they
really
want
to
pay
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
the
wealth
tax
in
france?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
other
reasons
underlying
it,
which
is
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
before?
i
see,
literally,
that
the
common
law...
you
know,
the
enforcement...
this
is
not
literally
enforcement.
so
what
i
was
driving
at
with
my
questions
is,
even
though
literally
it's
not,
the
problems
of
complexity,
the
problems
of
knowability,
and
the
problems
of
there
being
so
many,
many
foreign
tax
laws
that
we
might
think
are
basically
unfair,
that
those
considerations
apply
here,
just
as
they
do
with
the
enforcement
rule,
and
then
add
the
fact
that
turning
people
into
criminals
under
threat
of
prosecution
by
the
federal
government
is
really
very
much
equivalent
to
enforcing
the
foreign
rule
in
a
court.
i
mean,
that's
the
whole
thing
spelled
out.
and
i
meant
it
seriously,
though
i
used
foreign
examples
to,
sort
of,
drive
the
point
home.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about...
what
about
a
scheme--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--have
countries
also...
just...
here,
i
don't
know,
in
respect
to
the
principle...
would
it
have
been
viewed
as
contrary
to
the
principle
if
a
country
were
to
pass
a
law...
say,
england
were
to
pass
a
law
saying
it
is
a
crime
in
england
not
to
pay
french
taxes?
i'm
not
saying
they
couldn't
do
it;
i'm
just
saying,
would
a
law
like
that,
saying
it
is
a
crime
in
england
not
to
pay
french
taxes...
would
it
have
been
viewed
as
contrary
to
an
abrogation
of...
or
a...
you
know,
whatever
you
call
it...
a
derogation
from
the
common
law
revenue
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
do
you
see
why
i
want
to
characterize
it?
i
mean,
would
you
characterize...
my
criminal
statute's
absolutely
clear...
the
clear
is,
it
is
a
crime
in
england
not
to
pay
french
taxes.
now,
would
you,
or
would
scholars,
or
whoever,
view
about
the
common
law
revenue
rule,
would
they
have
said,
"there
is
a
derogation
from
the
common
law
revenue
rule.
"
or
would
they
have
said,
"it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
what
would
you
have
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nobody
says
they
can't
do
it.
that's
why
i
asked
you
my
question.
my
question
is
simply
whether
you
would
consider
an
absolutely
clear
law...
"we
will...
we...
it
is
a
crime
not
to
pay
your
french
taxes.
"
i'm
asking
whether
you
would
consider
that...
i'm
not
saying
they
can't
do
it;
i
just
want
to
know...
would
it
be
in
derogation
of
the
common
law
principle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
where--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
would
be
another
one,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
the...
i...
that's
why
i
want
to
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
got
your
point.
i
think
it
is
the...
in
my
answer...
in
my
clear
example,
you
would
say
no,
that's
not
in
derogation
for
the
reason
that
there's
an
independent
local
reason
for
doing
it.
it's
not
being
done
to...
whether
it
has
that
effect
or
not,
it's
not
being
done
in
order
to
collect
the
foreign
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
been
your
response
throughout.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
he's
saying
it
isn't,
for
the
reason
that,
he
says,
that
if
england
did
it
for
independent
reasons,
it
wasn't
doing
it
because
it
wanted
to
help
france
get
it's
money,
that
then
it
wouldn't
have
been
in
derogation.
of
course,
it
would
have
been
legal,
either
way,
but
he
says
it
wouldn't
have
been
in
derogation,
for
that
reason.
