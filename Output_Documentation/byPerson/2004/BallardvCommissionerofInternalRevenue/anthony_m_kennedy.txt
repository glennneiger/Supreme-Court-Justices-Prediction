justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
make
the
argument
that...
maybe
you
can't...
that
the
special
trial
judge
can
go
to
the
tax
court
judge,
with
the
permission
of
the
chief
judge,
and
say,
now,
here's
what...
kind
of
what
i'm
thinking?
it's
not
my
report,
but
here's
what
i'm
thinking.
and
then
the...
the
tax
court
judge
says,
well,
why
don't
you
have
some
more
findings
on
x
and
y
and
z?
he
says,
okay,
and
then
he
goes
back.
can
you
make
the
argument
that
that
first
document
is
not
the
report?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
another
way
of
saying
it
is,
do
the
rules
permit
any
consultation
before
the
report
is
submitted?
i...
i
guess
that's
my
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let...
let
me
ask
this
question,
if
i
may.
suppose
the...
a
special
trial
judge
hears
the
witnesses,
makes
a
report.
it's
assigned
by
the
chief
judge
to
a
tax
court
judge,
and
the
tax
court
judge
looks
it
over
it
and
says,
you
know,
before
i...
before
i
really
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
this,
you
really
didn't
explore
these
three
problems.
would
you
please
do
it
over
again?
is
he
permitted
to
do
that
or
is
that
a
violation
of
the
rule
that
he
shall
presume
the
report
to
be
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
if
it's
a
violation
of...
of
the
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the...
the
rule
says
a
special
report
shall
be
presumed
to
be
correct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
there's
this
initial
review,
he
says,
you
know,
i
think
it's
really
pretty
incomplete
until
you
do
x,
y,
z,
please
do
it
over
again,
is
that
a
violation
of
the
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would...
would
you
comment
on
that?
i...
i
understood
from
the
brief
there
was
a
suggestion
that
if
you
prevail,
we're
going
to
have
a
huge
volume
of...
of
printed
material
that
we're
not
troubled
with
now.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
rule...
the
rule
says
that
the
first
report,
the
document
1,
has
to
be
given
deference.
it's
presumed
to
be
correct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
sure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
how
do
we
know
that
it
was...
that
it
was
presumed
to
be
correct
under
the
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're...
you're--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--have
a
condition
subsequent.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying,
mr.
hungar,
that
the
last
sentence
of
183
is
unenforceable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
statute
you
just
quoted
prohibit
the
disclosure
of
other
reports
if
we
call
this
first
draft
something
other
than
a
report?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
would...
would
the
rule
go
further
than
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
a...
that's
not
a
de
novo...
they
can
rehear
matters
de
novo
on
the
en
banc
tax
court,
can
they
not?
that's
a
de
novo
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
ballard
versus
internal
revenue
service,
03-184
and
kanter
versus
internal
revenue
service,
03-1034.
