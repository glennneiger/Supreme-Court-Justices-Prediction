at

bader

--mr.
shapiro,
why
don't
you
simply
read
the
text
of
183(b)--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--which
is
in
the
government's
brief
at
4a?
it
says,
special
trial
judge's
report.
it
is
the
only
report
to
which
the
tax
court
rules
refer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
not
the
government's
brief.
the
tax
court
rules.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
4a
of
the
government's
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would...
would
that
problem
be
overcome
if
the
special
trial
judge
simply...
if
his...
the
proceedings
before
him
were
simply
videotaped
and
then
the
reviewing
judge,
judge
dawson
in
this
case,
could
look
at
the
trial
proceedings
and
would
have
as
much
of
a
notion
of
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
as
the
special
tax
judge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shapiro,
on
credibility,
which
you
have
been
emphasizing,
are
you
overstating
the
case
for
it?
because
credibility
is
more
than
just
observing
the
witnesses'
demeanor.
i
mean,
judge
dawson
could
have
said,
yes,
they...
these
witnesses
might
have
looked
honest
to
the
special
trial
judge,
but
considering
this
documentary
evidence
in
the
record,
it's
clear
to
me
that
what
the
witness
said
on
the
stand
was
a
lie.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do...
do
i
understand
that
you
would
be
satisfied
if
the
court
simply
looked
to...
what
is
it...
7482(a)(1),
the
appellate
review
section,
which
says
that
the
tax
court
decisions
shall
be
reviewed
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
district
court
decisions?
and
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
where
is
it?
it's...
it
is
specified
someplace,
but
when
you
review
a
district
court
decision
in...
in
a
court
of
appeals,
the...
certainly
the
magistrate's
report
would
be
included,
but
there's
someplace
where
it
lists
the
contents,
some
rule
that
lists--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--would
the...
the
tax
court
rule...
now,
this
183(c)...
says...
it
describes
the
special
trial
judge's
report,
which
is
submitted
to
the
chief
judge,
and
then
the
chief
judge
assigns
a
tax
court
judge,
and
then
it
says
that...
that
the
tax
court
judge
may
modify
it,
modify
the
special
trial
judge's
report,
or
may
reject
it
in
whole
or
in
part.
does
the
tax
court
ever
modify
a
special
trial
judge's
report?
does
it
ever
reject
it
in
whole
or
in
part?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
one
thing
that
they
can
do.
they
can
adopt
it,
but
my
question
is,
do
they
always
adopt
and
never
use...
never
use
the
term
modify
it
or
reject?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
these...
these--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the...
the
special
trial
judge
has
no
tenure,
does
she?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hungar,
before
you
proceed
to
your
legal
argument,
i
was
very
curious
why
the
government
is
defending
this
practice
because
the
government,
after
all,
is
on
the
other
side
of
every
case.
and
aren't
there
situations
where
it
might
be
that
the
special
trial
judge
would
call
a
credibility
question
in
the
government's
favor
and
then
the
government
loses
the
case
before
the
tax
court
judge
and
might
like
to
know,
before
it
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals,
how
solid
the
credibility
findings
were?
i
mean,
i...
i...
the
government
being
a
party
to
all
these
proceedings,
why
is
it
satisfied
with
not
knowing
what
the
report
of
the
special
tax
judge...
special
trial
judge
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
it
is
not
the
report.
it
is
called
an
opinion.
it
isn't
even
called
the
report,
and
if
you
will
read
183(b),
that
describes
the
report.
does
anything
else
describe
the
report?
and
what
is
this
report?
there
is
a
report.
it
is
submitted
to
the
chief
judge.
what
would
you
call
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
what
is
the
183(b)
report?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
that
report,
the
special
trial
judge's
report,
is
a
document
prepared
by
the
special
trial
judge
which
he
gives
to
the
chief
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hungar,
do
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
see
somewhat
of
a
problem,
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
the
relationship
between
peers?
judge
dawson
is
appointed,
what,
for
a
15-year
term.
the
special
trial
judge
is
appointed
by
the
tax
court
and
his
job
is
at
the
tax
court's
grace.
and
if
you
have
compared
in
your
brief
that
relationship
to,
say,
a
discussion
among
colleagues,
i
think
it's
worlds
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
has
had
a
special...
a...
a
long
term
and
he
is
well-known
and
respected
as
a
tax
court
judge
who
was
appointed,
as
all
other
members
of
the
court
were
appointed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
to
me--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
seems
to
me
that
it's
very
much
like,
if
you
have
to
compare
it
with
something,
the
relationship
between
a
magistrate
and
a
federal
district
court
judge.
the
magistrate
also
hears
testimony,
makes
a
report,
findings,
and
a
recommendation.
what's
the
difference
between
those
two?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
that
explained
in
the
rules,
if
that's
the
process?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
they...
do
they
ever?
i
mean,
this...
this
says,
this
decision...
it's
labeled...
the...
the
court
agrees
with
and
adopts
the
opinion
of
the
special
trial
judge.
are
there
tax
court
cases
where
the
tax
court
says,
instead
of
that,
the
court
modifies
the
decision
of
the
special
trial
judge
or
the
court
rejects,
in
whole
or
in
part,
the
report
of
the
special
trial
judge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
tax
court
opinions
come
out
that
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
if
one
were
just
to
rule
this...
read
this
rule
straight:
first,
the
report
that
goes
to
the
chief
judge,
and
then
it
says
that
the
tax
court
judge
may
modify
it,
reject
it
in
whole...
adopt,
modify,
or
reject
in
whole
or
in
part.
you
would
expect,
if
we
were
having
truth
in
labeling,
that
whenever,
with
consultation,
without,
there's
a
difference
between
the
two
documents,
the
tax
court
judge,
in
combination
with
the
special
trial
judge
or
without,
would
say,
action
on
the
report...
action
on
the
report,
which
is
the
special
trial
judge's
report,
is
it
is
modified
or
it
is
rejected
or
it
is
rejected
in
part.
i
mean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
rule...
the
rule
doesn't
say
anything
about
this
consultation
that
you've
described.
and
if
that's
the
tax
court's
procedure,
why
isn't
it
laid
out
in
the
rules
so
everyone
can
see
it
instead
of
being
deceived
by
reading
here
is
the
special
trial
judge's
report,
and
now
what
the
tax
court
will
do
is
either
adopt,
modify,
or
reject
in
whole
or
in
part?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
misleading.
because
when
i
just
read
this
rule
cold,
that's
what
i
assumed,
that
we
have
the
initial
report
and
then
it
goes
to
the
tax
court
judge,
and
that
judge
does
something
with
it,
and
that
something
may
be
adopt,
it
may
be
modify,
it
may
be
reject
in
whole
or
in
part.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
like
an
en
banc.
i...
i
have
written
decisions
for
a
panel
in
my
years
on
the
court
of
appeals,
and
there's
been
an
en
banc
and
my
opinion
gets
vacated.
it's
no
longer
counts
for
anything.
and
isn't
that
exactly
what
the
tax
court
is?
they
have
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--oh,
no.
no,
no,
no.
how
often,
when
there
is
a
decision
reviewed
by
the
court,
so
that
the
initial
judge's
decision
is
changed,
does
that
judge
dissent,
so
all
the
world
knows
what
that
judge's
initial
position
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
he...
then
he
can
publish
his...
he
can
publish
his
dissent,
just
as
a
tax
court
judge
can?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
we
still
won't
know
what
his
report
is.
yes,
he
can
say,
i
won't
sign
this.

court
says,
fine.
this
rule
says
i
can
reject
your
findings
in
whole
or
in
part.
i
don't
need
your
name
on
this
decision
of
the
tax
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
you
just
as
the...
the
judge
who
disagrees
with
the...
the
full
court
can
publish
his
dissent,
can
the
special

judge
who
disagrees
with
the
tax

judge
publish
his
dissent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
there
ever
been?
justice
ruth
bader

and
how...
how
often
does
the...
is
there
a
dissent
when
there's...
when
there's
a
full

review
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we...
we
don't
have
to
get
into
any
of

if
we
accept
your
argument
about

with

requirement
that
the

received

and
because
the
report
was
to
be
withheld
from
the
parties
the
new
rule
dropped
the
provision
giving
parties
an
opportunity
to
set
forth
exceptions
to

once
the
rule

were
in
place,
the

significantly
altered
its
practice
in
cases

for

not

judges.
in
accord
with
the
revised
rule
the

now
denies

and
excludes
the

from

since

have
refrained
from

instead
the

the

in

invariably
begins
with
this
stock
statement.
the

that

the

has
instituted
a
practice
in
which
it
treats

but
without

the
appellate

will
be
at
a
loss
to
determine
whether

were
given

whether

in
this
very
case,
two

allegedly
informed

for

of

taxpayers
that
the
special

judge,
in
the
post

report
he
filed
by
the
chief

found
the

overstated
and
the

are
all
