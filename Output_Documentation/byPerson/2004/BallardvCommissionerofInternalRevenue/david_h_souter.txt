justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
if
in
fact--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
rely
on
the
rule,
do
we
even
have
to
resolve
the
issue
of
meaning
of
report
in
the
statute?
can't
we
simply,
from
your
position,
rely
on
the
rule
and
say
you've
got
to
follow
your
own
rules?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you've
really
got
three
arguments.
you've
got
the
rule.
you've
got
the
statute,
and
you
have
due
process.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
the
way
the
rule
reads.
the
rule
reads,
as
i
understand
it,
under
(c)
that
the
court
itself
may
accept,
reject,
or
modify.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
special
trial
judge
reconsidering
and
rewriting
his
report.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
i
don't
see
what
is
consistent
with
your
notion
of
a
deliberative
process
as
producing
the
report
and
the
presumption
of
correctness
in
the
rule.
the
rule
presumes
that
some
original
document,
which
you
are
treating
as
provisional,
enjoys
a
presumption
of
correctness,
and
i
don't
see
the
consistency
between
provisionality
and
deliberate
character
on
the
one
hand
and
presumption
on
the
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
aren't
those
findings
of
fact
the
findings
of
fact
that
are
delivered
to
the
chief
judge
in
the
report
that
is
made
to
the
chief
judge
before
it
is
even
assigned
to
a
tax
court
judge?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
hasn't
abandoned
them
at
the
point
that
he
delivers
them
to
the
chief
judge,
and
if
that's
what
this
is
referring
to,
then
the
presumption
of
the...
of...
of
correctness
necessarily
has
to
apply
to
whatever
the
document
is
that's
delivered
to
the
chief
judge.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
presumption.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
the
rule
itself
in
that
respect
is
invalid?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
else
could
you
possibly
construe
it?
there's
no
presumption
operating
at
all
on
your
reading.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
saying
there
is...
there
is
no
presumption
of
correctness
that
can
operate
with
respect
to
the
report
that
goes
first
to
the
chief
judge
because,
i
understood
you
to
say,
to
do
that
would
violate
the
internal
revenue
code
provision
that
the
fact-finder
and
the
only
fact-finder
is
the
tax
court
judge.
and
therefore,
i
think
the
implication
of
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
rule
on
its
face
is
invalid.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm...
i'm
not
even
getting
to
whatever
the
standard
of
review
may
be.
i
presume
the
word
presumption
means
something
other
than
it's
there
unless
you
want
to
change
it
later
after
the
person
who
employs
you
objects
to
it.
it's
got
to
mean
something
more
than
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
no
party
who
is
seeking
to
change
at
this
point
because
the
parties
don't
know
what's
in
it.
they're
not
going
forward.
this
is,
as
you
point
out,
an
internal
process
that
is
going
on
here.
so
that
definition
can't
apply.
justice
david
h.
souter
any
weight?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i...
i
think
your...
i
think
your
answer
then
is
not
that
this
is
invalid.
it
is
simply
unenforceable.
it
is
precatory
language,
looks
okay,
but
there's
no
way
to
police
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
judicially
it
cannot
be
enforced.
justice
david
h.
souter
except
that
the...
the
relationship
between
the...
the
one
judge
and
the
full
tax
court
is
a
relationship
basically
of
people
who
are
in
the
same
boat
with
respect
to
what
they
know
about
or
can
know
about
law
and
what
they
can
know
about
the
evidence
and
the
facts
of
the
case;
whereas
the
relationship
between
the
special
trial
judge
and
the
judge
to
whom
it
is
assigned
is...
is
quite
different
because
only
one
of
them
has
heard
evidence
and
only
one
of
them
is
the
source
of
conclusion
about
fact.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
certainly
is
not
identical
in...
in
the
sense
that
the...
the
tax
court
judge
then
goes
and
listens
to
evidence.
he
doesn't.
that's
the
whole
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
neither
does
the
full
tax
court,
but
if
the
full
tax
court
is
disagreeing
with
one
judge,
the
one
judge
and
the
full
tax
court
are
in
the
same
boat.
they
have
access
to
the
same
material.
their
limits
are
exactly
the
same
in
each
case.
that
is
not
true
in
the
relationship
between
the
single
tax
court
judge
and
the
special
tax
court
judge.
the
special
tax
court
judge
is
the
only
one
who
has
heard
evidence
and
can
find
facts
based
upon
the
evidence
that
he
heard.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
am
quite
aware
of
that.
that's
not...
that's
not
the
point.
i'm...
i'm
saying
that
you
cannot
draw
an
analogy
between
one
judge
and
full
tax
court
and
use
that
as
an
analogy
to
legitimize
the
relationship
between
one
judge
and
a
trial
master.
they
are
in
different
positions.
they
are
not
in
parallel
positions.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
the
knowledge
issue.
the
special
tax
court
judge
heard
somebody.
justice
david
h.
souter
nobody
on
the
tax
court
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
they're...
they're
sitting
hearing
witnesses?
they
are...
they
are
redoing
the
trial?
surely
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
are
talking
about
situations
in
which
the
trial
judge
is
the
special
judge.
