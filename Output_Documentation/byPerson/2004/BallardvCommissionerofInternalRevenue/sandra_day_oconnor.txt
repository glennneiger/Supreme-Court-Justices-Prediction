justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
shapiro,
can
this
case,
in
your
view,
be
decided
solely
on
the
statutory
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
also
are
due
process
allegations,
and
i'm
not
sure
i
even
quite
understand
what
the
precise
due
process
violation
is
that's
alleged.
but
i
would
like
you
to
address
both
and
to
tell
us,
first
of
all,
how
it
would
be
resolved
solely
on
a
statutory
basis
from
your
perspective.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
that
include...
if
a
tax
court
judge
had
a
law
clerk,
would
it
include
law
clerk
memos
to
the
judge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
shapiro,
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
special
trial
judge
in
fact
changed
his
report
beyond
the
hearsay
affidavit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's...
it's
very
hard
to
understand
how
appellate
review
can
function
if
that
first
report
of
the
special
trial
judge
is
never
disclosed.
i
just
don't
see
how
the
appellate
review
can
function
properly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
how
does
the
appellate
court
know
whether
deference,
as
required
by
the
rules,
was
given
unless
the
appellate
court
can
see
it?
it's
such
a
strange
procedure.
why,
in
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
does
the
government
take
the
view
it
does?
wouldn't
you
like
to
see
it
if
it
went
against
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
rule--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
rule...
the
rule
183
does
provide
for
a
certain
degree
of
deference
to
be
given
to
those
findings
of
the
special
trial
judge.
