mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
judge
cudahy
stated
in
his
dissent
in
the
seventh
circuit
that
disclosure
of
the
rule
183
report
in
this
case
should
be
required
on
both
statutory
and
constitutional
grounds.
as
judge
cudahy
put
it,
there
is
no
item
of
more
significance
in
evaluating
a
tax
court's
decision
on
fraud
than
the
unfiltered
findings
of
the
stj.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
it
can.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
readiest
ground
for
decision
is
the
statutory
basis,
and
we
believe
that
the
statute
is
a
good
means
to
avoid
a
complex
due
process
question.
there
are
two
statutes
that
are
key
here.
one
is
the
appellate
review
statute.
the
other
is
the
public
record
statute.
the
public
record
statute
says
all
reports
of
the
tax
court
are
public
records,
and
we're
talking
about
a
report
of
the
tax
court
in
this
case.
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision
shows
congress
had
the
broadest
possible
intent
to
make
all
practices
in
the
tax
court
completely
transparent.
all
steps
in
the
adjudication
were
supposed
to
be--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we...
we
don't
take
that
position.
it
refers
to
reports
of
judges,
and
this
is
a
report
of
a
trial
judge
who
heard
the
witnesses.
the
report
is
presumed
correct
under
rule
183.
it's
the
only
independent
evaluation
of
witness
credibility--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
the
only
judge--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
is
only
one
rule
183
report.
under
the
rule,
it's
the
report
the
trial
judge
prepares
and
submits
to
the
chief
judge
at
the
completion
of
the
trial,
which
contains
his
independent
credibility
findings.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
under
rule
183(b)
there
is
a
report
denominated
as
such.
there's
no
question
here
it
was
submitted
to
the
court.
if
you
look
at
page
114a
of
the
kanter
appendix,
it
says
that
the
special
trial
judge
submitted
a
report,
as
required
by
rule
183(b).
and
this
case
was
then
referred
to
judge
dawson.
he
had
no
involvement
with
the
case
until
this
report
was
given
to
him.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh.
it's
the
petition
for
cert.
the
kanter
petition.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
114a,
114a.
and
throughout--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
it's--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
is
presumed
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
absolutely.
this
is
a
report
that
must
be
submitted.
it
is
presumed
correct
under
this
rule.
it's
an
independent
evaluation
of
credibility
from
the
only
judge
who
heard
the
witnesses,
and
of
course,
it's
part
of
the
record.
and
it
doesn't--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
it
doesn't
make
the
slightest
difference
that
the
superior
judge
caused
the
subordinate
judge
to
say,
i
have
changed
my
mind
at
a
later
stage
in
the
proceeding,
because
it
is
the
original
report
that
is
presumed
correct
under
the
rules.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's...
that's
appendix
4a.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
it's
the
rule
itself,
183(b).
and
it
makes
it
clear
that
there
must
be
a
report
filed
with
the
chief
judge.
the
docket
here
says
that
that
was
done.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
first...
there
is
only
one--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
rules
are
silent
on
that,
but
judge
dawson
has
no
involvement
in
the
case
until
the
report
is
submitted.
then
the
case
is
assigned
to
judge
dawson,
and
then
he
is
supposed
to
review
it
under
a
presumptive
correctness
standard.
so
it
would
be
surprising
if
there
were
consultation
of
that
sort.
but
what
we
contend
is
if
there
is
consultation
behind
the
scenes
about
credibility
determinations,
then
it
is
critically
important
that
the
report
be
submitted
and
made
part
of
the
record
and
not
concealed,
and
that
the
deferential
standard
of
review
be--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
suppose
that's
a
possibility,
but
in
anderson,
the
court
said
absent
some
procedure
like
that,
the
trial
judge
is
uniquely
situated
to
evaluate
demeanor
and
tone
of
voice,
and
because
of
that,
great
deference
has
to
be
given
to
the
independent
evaluation
of
the
trial
judge.
maybe
in
a...
in
the
future
the
tax
court
would
want
to
use
a
procedure
like
that
to
mitigate
the
raddatz
problem
that
they
now
have.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
they...
they
might,
and--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's
correct,
and
after
all,
we
should
remember
that
the
government
was
supposed
to
present
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
fraud
in
this
case,
and
if
there
was
a
flip-flop
of
this
sort
going
on
behind
the
scenes,
leaving
no
trace
in
the
record,
what
could
be
more
important
to
the
reviewing
court
than
to
know
what
had
occurred
at
the
first
stage
and
the
second
stage
here?
if
the
trial
judge
found
no
underpayment
and
no
fraud,
which
we
have
reason
to
believe
he
did...
three
tax
court
judges
stated
that
to
us...
if
that
was...
that
was
his
finding
and
he
found
our
witnesses
to
be
credible,
then
an
unexplained
overturning
of
that
credibility
determination
with
no
trace
in
the
record
would
surely
be
a
candidate
for
reversal
on
appeal.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we
haven't
challenged
the
conversations
as
such.
we
think
it
is...
it
is
suspect,
however.
under
raddatz,
if
somebody
who
has
not
heard
the
witnesses
is
telling
somebody
who
has
heard
the
witnesses,
i
don't
agree
or
i
think
you
may
be
wrong
in
your
credibility
determination,
i'd
like
you
to
reconsider
that,
that's
a
serious
raddatz
problem.
and
the
only
cure
for
that
is
to
make
the
first
report
part
of
the
record.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
think
the
rule
is
silent
on
that,
but
the
spirit
of
the
rule,
frankly,
is
that
the
stj
does
his
job.
he
completes
his
report.
he
submits
it,
and
the
reviewing
judge
examines
it
under
a
presumed-correct
standard
in...
in
the
same
orderly
fashion
that
ordinarily
occurs
when
there
is
an
initial
judgment
from
a...
from
a
trial
judge
about
credibility
with
deferential
review
that
comes
later.
but
the
rule
doesn't
tell
us
much
about
these
consultations,
and
we
do
submit
that
if...
if
they
do
take
place,
as
the
government
suggests,
there's
importuning
and
changing
of
minds
going
on
through
consultations,
do
this
on
record.
turn
square
corners
because
it
would
be
quite
important
to
the
appellate
court
to
know
if
there
was
a
good
reason
for
the
overturning
of
these
credibility
determinations.
and
we...
we've
seen
that
kind
of
review
in
the
stone
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
which
is
very
similar
to
this
case.
factually
the
cases
are
quite
similar.
and
the
reviewing
court,
judge
williams,
found
clear
error
based
on
what
the
rule
183
report
stated
about
witness
credibility.
there
was
an
elaborate
explanation
why
particular
witnesses
were
credible
and
incredible,
and
the
court
could
use
that
to
evaluate
the
judgment
of
the
tax
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
that's
true.
they
could
cease
using
the
stj's,
but--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i...
i
suppose
that
could
happen.
if
there
is...
if
there
is
no
report
written,
we
couldn't
contend
it
has
to
be
disclosed
under
these
statutes,
and
that...
that
might
be.
but
it...
there
could
be
a
raddatz
issue
in
that
scenario
that
you
present,
justice
scalia.
if
one
judge
heard
the
witnesses
and
the
other
judge
didn't
hear
the
witnesses
and...
and
the...
the
superior
judge--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--but
it...
it
would
be...
it
would
be
quite
strange
to
have
credibility
determinations
made
by
a
judge
who
had
never
heard
from
any
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the...
the
closest
analogy
in
this
court's
decisions
is
the
morgan
ii
decision.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
now,
morgan
ii
is
really
on
point
because
there,
a
subordinate
official
drafted
up
findings,
proposed
findings,
didn't
serve
them
on
the
parties,
but
did
give
them
to
the
decision-maker,
the
agency.
and
this
court
held
that
was
a
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
absolutely.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and...
and
every
administrative
body
that
we
know
of
in
the
federal
courts
and
in
the
state
too...
chief
judge
vanderbilt
pointed
that
out
in
the
mazza
case.
every
state
in
the
union
requires
disclosure
of
these
administrative
law
decisions
to
the
parties.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
well,
we...
we've
avoided
suggesting
that
any
depositions
should
be
taken
of...
of
judicial
personnel
here.
that's
not
our
view.
our
view
is
simply
that
the
report
that
was
prepared...
it
was
prepared...
should
be
made
part
of
the
record
by
virtue
of
two
statutes.
there
is
an
appellate
review
statute,
justice
o'connor,
that
states
quite
expressly
that
congress
expected
review
to
take
place
here
just
as
it
does
in
the
district
court,
to
the
same
degree,
to
the
same
extent,
and
in
the
same
manner.
and
in
the
district
court,
if
an
adjunct
judge
makes
a
finding
of
fact,
whether
it's
a
master
or
a
magistrate
or
bankruptcy
judge,
that
is
always
disclosed
to
the
parties.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
don't
know
what
is
contained
in
that
first
report.
we
have
heard
from
three
of
the
judges,
including
the
chief
judge
of
the
stj's,
that...
that
what
happened
was
that
judge
dawson
rewrote
the
credibility
findings.
now,
we
won't
know
until
we
see
this.
that
could
be
wrong.
but...
but
it
should
be
part
of
the
record
for
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
you'll
see
in
perhaps
a
dozen
situations,
he
says,
i
simply
don't
believe
that
witness,
none
of
whom
he
heard.
and
this
is
a
case
where
credibility
was
key.
was
there
a
bribery
scheme
of
the
kind
that
the
irs
claimed?
every
witness
who
testified
said
no,
it
didn't
exist.
these
are
simple
investments
with
the
proceeds
being
paid
to
the
corporations,
and
yet,
the
government's
theory
was
there
is
some
nefarious
bribery
scheme
that
every
witness
denied.
and
there
is
no
documentary
evidence
of
that.
the
evidence
of
the
proceeds
flowing
to
these
corporations
was
simply
the
result
of
their
investing
money
in
real
estate
deals.
and
so
credibility
was
the
key
to
this
whole
case.
and
the...
the
government,
i
don't
think,
can
be
serious
when
it
tells
this
court
that
this
first
report
is
some
confidential
document,
that
it's
privileged
internal
deliberative
material.
for
40
years,
the...
the
tax
court
made
these
reports
available
to
the
public.
it...
they
were
routinely
served
on
the
parties.
for
40
years
there
was
no
suggestion--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--oh,
yes.
that's
a
post
hoc
rationale.
there
was
no
such
explanation
when
this
rule
was
changed,
and
there's
not
a
bit
of
work
or
a
bit
of
expense
resulting
from
our
position.
we
simply
ask
for
a
copy
of
a
report
that
exists.
they
can
serve
it
on
us
electronically.
it
won't
cost
them
a
cent.
we're
making
a
very
modest
request
under
these
statutes
and
under
the
due
process
clause.
and
there
was
no
explanation--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
we
defer
to--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it...
it
really
is
not.
we're
asking--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--to
give...
and
make
it
part
of
the
appellate
record.
we're
not
asking
for
any
remand
to
the
tax
court.
if
the
tax
court
doesn't--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
we...
we
just
rely
on
that
as
an
example
of
the
need
to
disclose
this
at
an
appropriate
juncture.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
in
morgan
ii,
the...
the
point
was
that
any...
any
proposed
findings
that
are
drafted
up
have
to
be
shared
with
the
parties.
now,
there
they
had
to
be
shared
with
the
parties
at
the
administrative
level.
we're
not
going
that
far.
if
the
tax
court
tells
us
that
they
don't
want
to
have
that
layer
of
review
within
the
tax
court,
they
don't
want
to
receive
our
comments
on
the
initial
report,
that's
fine
with
us.
we
want
it
to
be
made
part
of
the
appellate
record
so
that
the
judges
who
are
interested
in
this
and
believe
it
will
shed
a
strong
light
on
the
issue
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
can
have
this
be
part
of
the
record.
and
already
the
fifth
circuit
has
overturned
the
finding
of
fraud
in
this
very
same
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
we'd
be
satisfied
because
that
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
say
the
record
has
to
include
the
rule
183
report.
and
it
is
not
up
to
the
trial
court
to
tell
the
appellate
court
what's
in
the
record
on
appeal.
it's
up
to
the
appellate
court
to...
to
determine
what
goes
into
that...
that
record.
this...
the
case
in
the
second
circuit
on
that
is
ibm
v.
united
states
where
the
second
circuit
analyzed
rule
10(a)
and
said
it
is
not
the
province
of
the
trial
court
to
dictate
to
the
reviewing
court
what
is
in
that
record.
and
this
court
in--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--oh,
yes.
it's
rule
10(a)
and
it's...
it's
very
general.
it
says
that
all
the
original
papers
in
the
trial
court
come
before
the
appellate
court,
and
an
original
report
is
an
original
document
submitted
in
the
trial
court.
and
this
court
confronted
that
question
in
universal
camera
50
years
ago,
and
the
government
made
the
same
arguments
then
that
it's
making
now
and
it
lost
7
to
2
in
that
case.
it...
it
said
that
the
report--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
goes
back.
[laughter]
the
same
argument
was
made
that
the
report
is
an
irrelevance.
it's
just
an
aid
to
the
decision-maker,
and
the
decision-maker
can
do
what
it
wants
and
has
ultimate
judgmental
power.
so
there's
no
need
to
include
that
report
in
the
record,
and
no
weight
should
be
given
to
it.
this
court
said,
we
will
not
adopt
an
exclusionary
rule
for
the
administrative
law
judge's
report.
and
this
is
an
a
fortiori
case
because
this
report
is
presumed
correct.
in
universal
camera,
there
was
no
presumption
of
correctness
at
all.
so
that...
that
case,
you
know,
goes
further
than...
than
what
the
court
has
to
do
here.
and
the
government's
argument
that...
that
somehow
this
is--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
yes,
that's
true.
but,
you
know,
the
court
reached
out
to
the
apa
for
guidance
in
construing
the
labor
laws.
the
labor
laws
were
silent
on
this
issue,
but
under
the
apa,
the
court
said
the
general
policy
is
to
disclose
these
reports
and
we
are
going
to
say
that
that
is
applicable
to
the
nlrb.
now,
the
government
says
all
of
this
changes
the
course
because
the
judge
changed
his
mind,
but
you
know,
there
are
so
many
opinions
and
orders
and
reports
in
the
federal
judicial
system
where
a
mind
is
changed
and
an
opinion
is
suppressed
or...
or
vacated
or
replaced
and
that
first
opinion
is
still
part
of
the
record.
it's
a
fallacy
to
say
it's
not
part
of
the
record
just
because
it's
been
abandoned.
for
example,
if
i
seek
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court
and
it's
denied
and
then
i
ask
for
reconsideration
and
it's
granted,
the
opinion
has
been
abandoned,
but
it's
still
part
of
the
record.
and
if
i...
if
an
appeal
is
taken,
it's
going
to
be
exhibit
a
in
any
appeal,
and
it
may
result
in
a
reversal.
same
thing
when
a
case
goes
en
banc.
the
panel
opinion
is
vacated,
but
then
when...
when
cert
is
granted,
the
argument
before
this
court
may
convince
this
court
that
the
panel
was
right.
even
though
it's
been
abandoned,
it's
still
very
important.
or
if
a
jury
verdict
is
set
aside...
the...
the
district
court
says,
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law...
on
appeal,
the
jury...
jury
verdict
may
get
sustained.
so
it's
just
a
logical
fallacy
to
say
that
because
somebody
has
changed
his
mind,
if
that's
what
happened
here,
that...
that
the
first
report
drops
out
of
the
record.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
yes,
and...
and
the
remarkable
thing
is
that
every
time
it
does
that,
it
recites,
we
hereby
adopt
the
findings
and
opinions
of
the
trial
judge.
now,
in
the
old
days,
that
was
not
a
problem.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
no.
they...
they
do
modify
and
reject.
it's
just
it's
hard
to
determine,
when
they
are
doing
that.
in
the
old
days--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--they
don't--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
that's
entirely
correct.
and
now,
in
the
old
days,
before
they
amended
the
rule,
you
could
compare
the
two
and
see
what
was
changed,
but
now
you
can't.
you
can't
tell
what
has
been
changed.
and
in
this
instance,
we
believe
there's
been
a
complete
rewrite
of
that
first
report,
and
the
appellate
courts
can't
tell
what's
going
on.
was
there
a
reason
for
doing
this?
was
deference
given?
was
some
other
agenda
at
work
in
this
decision?
no
one
can
tell
because
it
is
all
off
the
record.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i...
i
haven't
either.
but
the
judge
here
certainly
was
subordinate
and--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes,
he
was.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
he...
he
is
a
subordinate
because
as
the
government
keeps
telling
us,
the
tax
court
judge
is
the
only
official
spokesman
for
the
court.
they
get
to
make
the
final
judgment.
and
the
tax
court
judge
reviews
what
the
stj
has
done.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes,
and
this
a
court.
this
is
an
article
i
court,
this
court
has
held.
and
congress
has
created
very
specific
appellate
review
procedures
for
this
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
he...
those
judges
could
be
terminated
at
will,
including
because
there
is
not
sufficient
work
for
the
judge.
they
can
be
terminated
on
that
basis.
and
that,
we
think,
colors
the
analysis
here
for
the
reasons
judge
cudahy
gave.
this
is
not
an
independent
judge.
when
he
is
persuaded
by
his
superior
to
change
his
mind,
it's
obvious
that
he...
in
our
view,
that
he's
going
to
be
heavily
influenced
by
that.
it's
a
serious
raddatz
problem.
the
only
cure
is
to
make
this
part
of
the
record
and
to
enforce
the
rule
183
presumption
of
correctness,
which
creates
a
clear
error
standard
of
review.
i
see
my
time
has
run
out.
may
i
reserve
the
rest
for--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
question
came
up
whether
rule
183
forbids
disclosure
of
this
report.
the
answer
is
it
does
not
forbid
disclosure
of
the
report.
it
is
silent
on
the
point.
but
the
press
release
the
tax
court
issued
in
1983,
coming
from
the
chief
judge
of
the
court,
said
that
this
simply
meant
that
it
would
not
automatically
be
disclosed.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--our
view
is
that
of...
of
the
tax
court
means
any
report
emanating
from
the
tax
court.
that's
the
literal
meaning
of
that
language.
it
doesn't
mean
final.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there's
an
exception
for
the
en
banc
situation
because
legal
issues
are
addressed
en
banc,
not
the
factual
issues.
and
there's
an
opportunity
to
dissent.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
we
say
there's
a
special
statute
dealing
with
the
en
banc
situation
that...
that
governs
in
that
situation.
and
that
the
publicity--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that...
that's
the
en
banc
provision
that
counsel
referred
to
that
said
that
when
the
case
is
heard
en
banc,
the
trial...
the...
the
single
judge's
report
is
not
made
part
of
the
record.
congress'
assumption
there
was
that
there
would
be
a
new...
new
report
issued.
people
would
be
able
to
dissent
if
they
disagreed.
and
this
process
focuses
on
legal
issues.
there
is
no
presumption
of
correctness.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
but
it
addresses
legal
issues.
it's
not
a
device
to
second
guess
factual
determinations,
and
there's
a
special
statute
that
deals
with
that,
which
does
not
apply
to
this
stj
situation,
where
there's
a
presumption
of
correctness
applicable
to
what
the
trial
judge
does.
and
there
is
the
general
disclosure
statute
that
applies
there.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
think
you're
right,
and--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
i...
i
think
that
the
intent
of
this
provision...
and
i
know
your
honor
consults
the
legislative
history.
the
intent
was
to
make
all
of
the
steps
in
the
adjudicative
process
transparent,
including
the
evidence,
including
the...
the
stenographer's
report,
and
all
reports
from
the
tax
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we
believe
that
the
word
all
is
a
broad,
generic
inclusive
term
that
should
be
applied,
as
judge
cudahy
stated,
to
an
stj
report
that
actually
has
to
be
submitted
to
the
chief
judge
and
that
has
legal
effect.
it's
not
just
a
casual
document
like
a
law
clerk
memorandum.
it
has
legally
operative
effect.
congress'
purpose
here
was
very
broad,
to
have
transparency,
applicable
to
all
the
steps
along
the
way
in
the
tax
court.
it
was
quite
clear
on
that,
that
there
are
arbitrary
actions
at
each
step
of
the
way.
if
you
look
at
the
senate
report
and
congressman
laguardia's
statements,
they
said
secrecy
is
a
vicious
practice
in
this
context,
and
it...
it
should
be
avoided.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
absolutely,
your
honor.
there...
there
are
three
separate
bases
for
ruling
in
our
favor.
one
is
the
appellate
review
statute.
the
other
is
the
disclosure
statute.
the
third
is
due
process.
and
due
process
should
inform
the
construction
of
these
statutes.
this
court
tries
to
avoid
serious
due
process
issues
through
its
interpretation
of
legislation.
judge
cudahy
suggested
that
was
the
right
way
to
decide
this
case
and
we
agree
that
it
is.
we
thank
the
court.
