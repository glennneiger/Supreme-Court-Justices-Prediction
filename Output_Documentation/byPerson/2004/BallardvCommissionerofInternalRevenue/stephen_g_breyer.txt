justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why...
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
elaborate
for
this
reason?
because
the
briefs
and
you
again
today
keep
talking
about
that
first
document.
you
use
the
word
report.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
to
me
that's
the
whole
conclusion
of
the
case.
i'm
prepared
to
assume,
at
least
for
the
moment,
if
you
can
convince
me
that
that's
the
report
they're
talking
about,
you'd
win.
but
that
isn't
what
the
government
says.
the
government
says
that's
a
piece
of
paper,
preliminary.
we...
like
my
draft.
i
write
drafts
all
the
time.
so...
so
do
trial
judges.
and
he
goes
and
brings
the
draft
to
the
other
two
judges
and
says,
let's
sit
down
and
talk
about
it.
and
they
sit
down
and
talk
about
it,
and
he
changes
his
mind
and
writes
a
different
document.
and
that
different
document,
of
course,
is
totally
public.
the
whole
opinion
of
the
tax
court.
there
is
that
document.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
know
that?
now...
now,
what
is
the
answer
specifically
in
the
statute?
let's
call
it
document
1
and
document
2.
and
it
really
didn't
help
me
that
much
in
the
briefs
to
see
document
1
continuously
labeled
with
the
word
report
when
i
thought
that's
the
key
question.
is
it?
is
it
that
report
they're
referring
to?
so
now,
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which...
which
brief--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what...
what
page?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what...
what
was
the
page?
please.
you're
going
quite...
and
i
want
to...
because
justice
ginsburg
referred
to
a
statement
in
the
government's
brief
that
you
said
yes--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
happens
in
cases
in
agencies,
you
know,
where...
where...
suppose
the
agency
itself
or
a
member
thereof
is
going
to
make
a
decision,
and
there
might
be
other
members
who
would
hear
the
witnesses.
and
i
was
thinking
of
that
analogy.
it's
possible.
it
happens
in
the
federal
communications
commission
where
the
staff,
you
know,
consults
back
and
forth
in
ratemaking
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
hard
to
find
precisely
the
analogy,
but
it
seems
likely.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
which
gives
and
takes
away.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
to
have
an
opportunity
to
refute
the
information
that's
going
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
analogize
the
stj
to
the
administrative
alj.
but
you
might
also
analogize
him
to
a
member
of
the
agency
itself,
and
if
you
make
that
analogy,
it
doesn't
become
so
far-fetched,
particularly
when
you
look
at
morgan
as
also
not
allowing
you
to
probe
at
what's
going
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is...
can
i
ask
you
a
really
esoteric
administrative
law
question,
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
figure
out?
it's
probably
relevant,
but
i...
this
is
an
agency.
that's
what...
my
great
tax
professor,
ernie
brown,
used
to
say
there
is
no
tax
court.
he
says,
the
board
of
tax
appeals
shall
be
known
as
the
tax
court.
what
he
meant
by
that
is
it's
not...
it
isn't
the
tax
court,
just
known
as.
so...
so
this
is
an
agency,
an
administrative
agency.
so
i
look
to
the
apa
for
guidance,
and
the
apa,
when
you
look
at
the
section,
says
this
initial
decision
can
be
made
by
a
556-qualified
person.
now,
a
556-qualified
person
can
include
the
agency
itself
or
a
member
of
the
agency
or
an
alj.
then
when
you
to
look
at
what
happens
in
557,
after
that
presiding
employee
makes
an
initial
decision,
it
says
you
have
to
give
a
chance
to
the
party
to
respond
to
the
initial
decision,
which
you
like,
in
the
case
where
the
presiding
employee...
presiding
person
is
a
subordinate
employee.
and
so,
that's
what
i
was
just
checking
here.
and
so...
so
what's
supposed
to
happen
where
the
presiding
person
under
556
for
that
initial
or
tentative
decision
is
not
a
subordinate
employee,
but
rather,
quote,
one
or
more
members
of
the
body
which
comprise
the
agency?
i've
never
run
into
that
before.
maybe
you
haven't.
maybe
they
didn't
mean
anything
by
it,
but
maybe
they
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
was
a
subordinate
employee?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rather
than
a
member...
is...
is...
if
he's
a
subordinate
employee,
that's
easy.
then
the
case
is
easy
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
just
looking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
where
does
it
say
that?
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
if
i'm
getting...
so
that's
his
basic
point.
the
rule
doesn't
require
the
disclosure
because
they've
interpreted
it
differently
within
their...
within
their
discretion.
the
statute
doesn't
require
it
and
the
constitution
doesn't
require
it.
if
we
have
to
go
to
the
constitution,
i
don't
see
exactly
the
implications.
so
i'm
nervous.
and
now,
the
reports...
he
says,
go
read
7460(b).
that's
what
they're
talking
about.
and
then...
and
again,
i
don't
know
what
i'm
getting
into
once
i
read
it
more
broadly
than
that.
and
what
about
all
evidence
received
by
the
tax
court,
including
a
transcript.
of
course,
this
isn't
evidence
but
neither
is
a
transcript.
and...
and
so
maybe
that
word
evidence
can
be
read
more
broadly,
given
the
fact
that
it's
to
include
a
transcript
of
the
stenographic
report.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
i'm
right
just
suddenly
for
the
for
the
first
time?
you
have
thought
of
this?
