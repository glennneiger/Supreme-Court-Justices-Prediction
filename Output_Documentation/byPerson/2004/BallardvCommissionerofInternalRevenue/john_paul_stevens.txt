the
court
will
now
hear
argument
in
ballard
against
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
shapiro.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
may,
of
course.
mr.
hungar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
not
requiring
the...
this
case
doesn't
involve
the
question
of
whether
they
can
make
objections
to
the
finding
in...
in
the
special
report.
it's
just
whether
it's
disclosed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand.
but
your
argument
about
how
it
would
make
the
proceeding
more
cumbersome,
it
seems
to
me,
is...
is
misplaced.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they're
not
asking
for
that.
am...
am
i
wrong
on--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
it's
a
particularly
strong
argument
in
a
case...
in
several
of
the
issues.
i
remember
judge
fromm's
opinion
turned
on
the
credibility
of
oral
testimony,
and
in
one
case,
judge
fromm
found
the...
the
judge
here
made
an
erroneous
ruling
on
credibility
on
one
issue,
if
i
remember
correctly.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
case
in
which
it
would
be
particularly
relevant
to
know
the
reasons
pro
and
con
on
why
credibility
determinations
were
made
by
the
person
who
heard
the
witnesses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
been
convinced
that
he
was
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question
is,
well,
what
was
his...
what
was
the
basis
for
his
original
position
when
you're
evaluating
whether
you've
got
a
valid
argument
to
make
on
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
only
if
he
is
required
by
a
rule
to
make
certain
findings
and
to
deliver
a
completed
report
to
someone
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
forbid
it.
you're
right.
it
doesn't
forbid
it
in
so
many
words.
but
i
just
wonder,
does
it
comport
with
your
normal
notions
of
a
fair
way
to
conduct
a
fair
hearing,
letting
the
parties
know
what
the
basis
for
decision
was
and
who
thought
what
about
the
witnesses
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
there's
any...
any
question
they
can
change
the
report,
but
the
one...
the
one...
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
as
a
matter
of
information.
the
first
sentence
of
183(c)
refers
to
the
possibility
that
the
judge
to
whom
the
case
is
assigned
may
direct
the
filing
of
additional
briefs
to
receive
further
evidence
and
oral
argument.
does
it
ever
happen
that
before
the
judge
to
whom
it's
assigned
decides
whether
or
not
to
go
along
with
the
recommended
findings,
that
he
will
direct
oral
argument?
does
that
ever
happen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
he
did,
it
would
seem
almost
necessary
for
him
to
disclose
to
the
parties
what
the
report
they're
arguing
about
would
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
certainly
seems
to
contemplate
deliberation
by
the
judge
to
whom
the
case
is
assigned
about
whether
or
not
to
accept
the
report
and
deliberation
which
might
be
informed
from
input...
input
from
the
parties.
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
rule,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it's
not
practiced.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
he
did
then
ask
for
further
briefings,
do
you
think
that
there
would
then
have
been
a
requirement
to
disclose
the
report?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
the
author
of
this
subsection
(c)
must
have
contemplated
the
possibility
of
disclosure
of
the
report.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
they
followed
a
different
procedure,
and
the
question
is
to
how
much...
how
much
did
they
intend
the...
to
change
that
prior
procedure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hungar,
i
think
we
understand
your
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
about
4
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
the
case
is
submitted.
