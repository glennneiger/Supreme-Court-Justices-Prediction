what...
what
page
did
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case,
they...
they
might
well
revise
the
language
of
their
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
currently
requires
that
the
finding
of
facts
of
the
trial
judge
be
presumed
to
be
correct.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
would...
would
just
solve
your
problem
in
this
case,
and...
and
in
the
future,
i
suppose
they
could
revise
rule
183
as
simply
not
to
require
a
report.
there...
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
requires
this
report,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
could...
they
could
use
them,
but
just
say,
instead
of
filing
a
report,
he'll
consult
with
the...
with
the
deciding
judge.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
confer
with
each
other.
maybe,
maybe.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
wait.
under
the
due
process
clause,
i
assume
you
would
be
asking
for
more
than
just
access
to
the
report.
you...
if...
if
you're
really
relying
on
morgan
ii,
he
who
hears
must
decide,
i
think
you
would
be
saying
that
after
reading
the
report,
you
should
have
the
opportunity
to
argue
to
the...
to
dawson
here,
to...
to
the
tax
court
judge
that
the
report
should
not
be
adopted.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
part
of
your
due
process
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it
satisfies
due
process
just
to
show
you
the
report,
and
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
then...
then
you're
not
relying
on
morgan
ii.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
wasn't
a
need
to
disclose
the
point
that
morgan
ii
made.
it
was
he
who
hears
must
decide.
justice
antonin
scalia
institutional
memory.
isn't
that...
that's
a
good
institutional
memory--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
course,
that...
that
was
decided
under
the
apa,
wasn't
it?
i
mean,
that
was
an
apa
case,
which
this
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
they...
they
never
say
so
in
their
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
always
say
that
they
adopt
the
trial
judge's
report.
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're...
you're
not
asserting
that
the
apa
governs
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
an
express
exception
for...
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it
does
because
it...
it
goes
on
to
say
that
due
regard
shall
be
given
to
the
circumstance
that
the
special
trial
judge
had
the
opportunity
to
evaluate
and
the
findings
of
fact
recommended
by
the
special
trial
judge
shall
be
presumed
to
be
correct.
but
if
those
findings
of
fact
are
simply
the
same
findings
of
fact
that
he
agrees
with
the
rest
of
the...
the
panel
on,
it
just
makes
no
sense
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
report
goes
to
the
chief
judge?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
report.
is
that
not
a
report?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
that...
why
isn't
that
required
to
be...
to
be
made
public?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
report.
the
statute
says
that
the
reports
have
to
be
made
public.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
a
report.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
goes
to
the--
--no?
justice
antonin
scalia
in...
in
that
discussion,
does
the
tax
court
judge
have
to
give
great
weight
to
the
findings
of
fact
of
the...
of
the
special
judge?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hungar,
you
started
to
say
that...
that
even
the
opinion
of
a...
of
a
tax
court
judge
is
not
a
report
of
the
tax
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
that
work?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was...
i
was
going
to
ask
you
what...
what
7461
referred
to
when
it
says
the
tax
court
and
its
divisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
also
is
referred
to
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
a
single
judge
is
a
division
of
the
tax
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
publicity
of
proceedings
does
say...
it
does
say
that
all
reports
of
the
tax
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
all
evidence
received
by
the
tax
court
and
its
divisions,
meaning
its
single
judges.
well,
what
happens
with...
with
a
single
judge's
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
7461
require
its...
its
disclosure?
because
it
does
say
that
the...
it's
only
the
decision
of
the
tax
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
reports
of
the
tax
court
that
have
to
be
disclosed.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
that
would
mean
that...
that
you
would
have
to
make
public
the...
the
reports
of
a
regular
tax
court
judge
in
cases
that
then
go
on
to
the
full
court.
and
that's
not
done,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
doesn't
matter.
it
would
still
be
a
report
of
the
tax
court
if
you
don't
take
that
language
literally.
if
you
say
any
report
coming
out
of
the
institution
is
a
report
of
the
tax
court,
you
would
have
to
make
public
the
reports
of
the
individual
tax
court
judges,
which
is
not
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
what...
what
statute
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's...
there's
a
very
careful
use
of
language.
it
says
all
reports
of
the
tax
court
and
all
evidence
received
by
the
tax
court
and
its
divisions.
so
it's
only
the
evidence
that...
that's
received
by
the
individual
judges
has
to
be
made
public,
not
the
reports.
