mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
flaw
in
petitioners'
case
is
that
both
of
the
trial
court
judges
responsible
for
evaluating
the
evidence
in
the
record
reached
the
same
conclusion
regarding
all
of
the
factual
issues.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
justice
ginsburg,
we
do
know
what
the
report
of
the
special
trial
judge
was.
it
is
in
the
record.
judge
couvillion's
name
is
on
his
report.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
report
is
the...
contains
the
recommended
findings
of
fact
and
opinion,
analysis
of
the
law
and
application
of
the
law
to
the
fact,
of
the
special
trial
judge.
the
report
is
the
findings
of
fact
plus,
quote,
the
opinion.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the...
under
rule
183(b),
the...
the
special
trial
judge
submits
his
report
to
the
chief
judge.
it
is
then
referred
to
a
tax
court
judge.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
correct.
but
the
important
thing
to
understand,
your
honor,
is
that
nothing
in
the
rule
precludes,
during
the
course
of
the
deliberative
process
that
then
follows,
the
special
trial
judge
from
concluding
that
he
has
made
a
mistake,
that
he
no
longer
agrees
with
the...
the
stated
findings
of
fact
in
that...
in
that
original
report,
from
withdrawing
and
submitting
a
corrected
report.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it
doesn't
preclude
it
either,
your
honor.
there's
a
longstanding
practice--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
tax
court
judge
cannot
report
in...
in
the
opinion
that
is
issued
by
the
tax
court,
he
cannot
say
i'm
adopting
the
opinion
and
findings
of
the
special
trial
judge
if
the...
if
the
tax
court
judge
does
not
agree
with
those
and
the...
and
the
special
trial
judge
adheres
to
his
original
decision.
the
only
way
it
is
possible
for
there
to
be
a
change
is
for
the
special
trial
judge
himself
to
determine,
in
the
exercise
of
his
responsibility
as
a
judicial
officer,
that
he
made
a
mistake.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
originally
the
original
report
goes
to
the
chief
judge.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it
is
a
report,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
because
if...
because
the...
because
the
tax
court
has
determined
that
it
will
not
be
made
public,
that
it
is
part
of
internal
deliberation.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
with
respect,
the
tax...
the...
the
statute
says
a
report
of
the
tax
court
must
be
made
public.
a...
a
report--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
justice
kennedy,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
first
to
finish
my
response
to
justice
scalia.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
statutes...
the...
the
disclosure
requirement
applies
only
to
reports
of
the
tax
court.
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
a
report,
the
original
report,
or
any
report
of
a
special
trial
judge
is
not
and
cannot
be
the
report
of
the
tax
court
unless
it
is
first
adopted
and
approved
by
a
tax
court
judge,
and
then
goes
through
the
next
step
of...
of
being
submitted--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--we
submit,
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
evidentiary
or
probative
value
in
an
initial
conclusion
that
the...
that
the
person
who
reached
that
conclusion
has
abandoned,
has
concluded
was
wrong.
special
trial
judge--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--couvillion
rejected--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--to
the
recommended
findings
of
the
special
trial
judge.
and
i
submit
that
if
the
special
trial
judge
has
concluded
that
his
initial
recommendations
were
mistaken
because,
based
upon
further
consideration
as
a
judicial
officer
in
the
exercise
of
his
obligations,
he
has
realized
he
made
a
mistake,
i
submit
it
would
be
bizarre
to
require
a
tax
court
judge
to
give
some
sort
of...
of
deference
to--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--abandoned
findings.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
justice
ginsburg,
judge
dawson
actually
is
a
senior
judge
who
was
recalled.
so
he
doesn't
have
the
15-year
term
protection.
but
it's
true
that
special
trial
judges
are...
are
appointed
by
the
chief
judge,
not
by
the
tax
court
judges,
but
by
the
chief
judge,
so
that
judge
dawson
wasn't,
in
a
sense,
his...
his
appointing,
employing
official.
but
more
to
the
point,
special--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
judge
couvillion
has
been
a
special
trial
judge,
i
think,
for
nearly
20
years.
but
the
point
is
special
trial
judges
are
bound
by
the
code
of
conduct.
the
tax
court
has
adopted
for
both
tax
court
judges
and
special
trial
judges
the
same
code
of
conduct
that
applies
to
federal
judges
under
article
iii,
which--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--obligates
independent
decision-making.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
one
difference
is
that
the
district
court
judges,
as
i
understand
it,
appoint
the
magistrate,
not
the
chief
judge.
but
a
more
significant
difference
is
that
the
statute
and
rules
applicable
to
magistrates
require
disclosure
of
their
reports
and
do
not
treat
them
as
part
of
the
internal
deliberative
process.
the
tax
court
has
determined
that
it
is
inefficient
to
have
disclosure
of
the
original
report,
then
have
exceptions
and
have
that
whole
process
followed
that
they
used
to
follow.
they
have
determined
that
they
will
treat
the
tax
court...
excuse
me...
the
special
trial
judge's
report--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
your
honor.
but
the...
but
the
tax
court
has
determined
not
to
disclose
it.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it
certainly
would
be
more
cumbersome
if
they
followed
the
procedure
that
they
used
to
follow,
which
we
submit,
although
the
record
is...
they
did
not
specifically
state--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
that's
true,
your
honor.
what
they're
asking
for
here,
what
they
say
they
want
is
merely
disclosure
of
the
original
report.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but
the
person
who
heard
the
witnesses
is
special
trial
judge
couvillion.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
under
that
rationale,
justice
stevens,
every
time
a
district
court
judge
changes
his
mind,
after
giving
further
thought
to
a
case--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--before
he
issues
his
final
opinion--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
again,
the...
the
rule
does
not
preclude
the
practice.
it
is
a
common
practice--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--absolutely,
your
honor.
if
the...
in
a...
when
a...
when
a
court
has
a
collegial
deliberative
process
involving
more
than
one
person
that
is
involved
in
the
decision-making...
certainly
this
is
an
unusual
process
in
that...
and
there
is
no
identical
analog,
but
we
see
no
due
process
problem.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
if
i
may,
your
honor,
the
rule
does
not
state
that
the,
quote,
original
report
shall
receive
a
presumption
of
correctness.
it
doesn't
even
say
that...
that
any
report
shall
receive
a
presumption
of
correctness.
it
says
the
findings
of
fact
recommended
by
the
special
trial
judge.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
not
if...
not
if
the
tax...
if
the
special
trial
judge
has
abandoned
those
recommendations,
withdrawn
those
recommendations,
and
replaced
them.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it
applies
to
the
report,
but
i
submit
that
if
the
special
trial
judge
withdraws
in
order
to
correct
an
error
in
the
report,
what
he
submits
as
the
corrected
report
is
then
the,
quote,
report.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the...
the
credibility...
the
due
regard
and
presumption
of--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
it's
important
to
understand
also
that,
in
fact,
it
would
violate
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
rule
must
be
construed
to
be
consistent
with
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
internal
revenue
code
makes
very
clear,
and
this
court
held
in
freytag,
that
the
tax
court
judge,
not
the
special
trial
judge,
is
the
decision-maker,
the
only
finder
of
fact
in
these
kinds
of
cases
under
subsection
(b)(4)
of
the
statute.
this
court
so
held
in
freytag
and
the...
and
the
statute
makes
that
very
clear.
so
it
would
violate
the
statute
to
construe
this,
as
petitioners
do,
to
require
some
sort
of
deferential
clear
error
review.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
if
construed
as
petitioners
would
have
it,
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
in
the
tax
context,
your
honor,
the...
there
is
a
presumption
of
correctness
that
attaches
to
assessments
and
deficiency
notices
issued
by--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
presumption
of
correctness
does
not
necessarily
equate
with
clear
error,
deferential
review.
that's
my
point.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
what
the
presumption
of
correctness
means
in
the
tax
context,
with
respect
to
deficiency
determinations
and
the
like,
is
that
the
burden
of
going
forward
is
on
the
party
seeking
to
change
what...
what...
the
determination
that
is
presumed
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
if...
there...
there
are
two
processes
that
go
on.
the
tax
court
judge,
quite
appropriately,
we...
we
assume
and
have...
have
no
reason
to
disagree,
confers
with,
discusses
with
the
special
trial
judge.
if...
if
in
the
course
of
that
discussion,
one
or
both
of
them
come
to
the
conclusion
that
something
is
wrong
in
the
original
report
and
if
the
special
trial
judge
agrees,
the
special
trial
judge
has
the
option
of
withdrawing
his
original
report,
submitting
a
corrected
report,
and
having
the
presumption
of
correctness,
whatever
it
means,
apply
to
his
corrected
report.
if...
if--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor,
not
great
weight
because,
again,
that
would
violate
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
he
is
to
give
due...
the
due
regard
provision
we
think
is
essentially
precatory,
as
the...
as
the
seventh
circuit
said.
it
reminds
the...
the
tax
court
judge
that
he
should
not
lightly
set
aside
the
credibility
determinations.
but
again,
that's
not
what
happened
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it's
certainly
not
enforceable
in
an
appellate
court.
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct,
because
otherwise
it
would
violate
the
statute
if
it
imposed
some
meaningful
limitation.
but
again,
it's
important
to
understand
here
the
tax
court
judge
did
not
exercise
his
authority
in
this
case
to
reverse
or
set
aside
the
special
trial
judge's
findings.
he
could
have
done
so--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--we
cite--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--we
cite
in
footnote
4
a
small
number
of
cases
from
prior
to
the
last
rule
change
in
which
that
occurred.
in
addition,
there
are
at
least
a
couple
of
cases
since
the
rule
change
in
which
the
tax
court
judge
rejected
parts
of
the
opinion,
but
not
the
findings.
we're
not
aware
of
any
cases
in
which
the
tax
court
judge
has
rejected
the
findings,
but
there
are
other
cases...
little
against
commissioner,
103
t.c.
285;
walker
against
commissioner,
101
t.c.
537...
in
which
the
tax
court
judge
expressed
a
disagreement
with
a
portion
of
the
opinion
of
the
special
trial
judge
and
then
proceeded
to
decide
the
case
in
the
manner
he
or
she
thought--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
again,
that
assumes
that
the...
that
the...
the
rule
compels
the
interpretation
that
the
special
trial
judge
is
prohibited
from
withdrawing,
correcting,
and
resubmitting
his
report.
i
submit
it
does
not
compel
that
interpretation,
and
the
tax
court--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
i
don't
think
it...
i
mean,
i
don't
think
it's...
it's
deceitful,
the...
the
possibility
that
a
court--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
when
the
tax
court
adopted
its
present
procedures
in
1984,
it...
it
certainly
did
not
do
so
in
as
artful
a
manner
as
it
could
have.
but
the
question
is
whether
it
violates
the
statute
or
due
process
for
it
to
do
what
it
has
done.
let
me
just...
we've
been
spending
most
of
our
time
talking
about
this
issue
of
whether
the
tax
court...
the
special
trial
judge
is
permitted
to
change
his
report
under
rule
183.
that's
not
even
one
of
the
questions
in
the
questions
presented.
the
only
rule
183
question
in
the
questions
presented
is
whether
the
rule
requires
clear
error
review.
we
submit
the
answer
to
that
is
no
because
it
would
violate
the
internal
revenue
code.
so
this...
this
question
about
whether
the
report
permits...
whether
the
rule
permits
the
report
to
be
changed
isn't
even
one
of
the
questions
presented.
the
courts
of
appeals
upheld
the
judgment
on
the
premise
that
it
was
permissible
for
the
tax
court
judge
and
the
trial...
the
special
trial
judge
to
engage
in
the
deliberative
process
and
for
the
special
trial
judge
to
revise
his
findings
as
he
did--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
i'm
not
aware
of
that,
but--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--again,
i...
this
is
a
holdover
from
the
prior
version
of
the
rule
in
which
the
exceptions
process
was
followed,
and
again,
it
may
be
that
had
the
tax
court
given
it
further
consideration,
they
might
have
viewed
that
unnecessary.
but
we're
not
aware
of
that
happening.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
if--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--if
the
tax
court
judge
so
determines,
yes.
the
rule
certainly
allows
that,
but
it
doesn't
obviously
require
that.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
presumably
it
would
be
a
waste
of
everyone's
time
unless
he...
i
don't
know
that
he
would
have
to
disclose
the
report,
but
he
would
need
to
direct
their
attention
to
the
issue
he
would
like
them
to
brief.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
again,
your
honor,
this
language
was
adopted
at
a
time
when
they
followed
the
exception--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
we
know
that
the
tax
court
has
interpreted
its
rule
to
permit
precisely
the
practice
it
followed
here
because
it
said
so.
and
it
would
be
quite
extraordinary,
we
submit,
for
this
court
to
reverse
the
tax
court,
which
is
surely
entitled
to
considerable
deference
in
interpreting
its
own
rules,
since,
after
all,
the
tax
court
has
exclusive
statutory
authority
to
promulgate
its
own
rules,
and
particularly
with
respect
to
this
issue
about
whether
the
special
trial
judge
can
change
his
report,
since
that
was
not
even
one
of
the
questions
presented.
if
i
may
turn
to...
back
to
the
statutory
question.
section
7461
requires
disclosure
of
reports
of
the
tax
court.
the
special
trial
judge
report
is
not
the
report
of
the
tax
court.
indeed,
even
a
tax
court
judge's
opinion
and
report
does
not
become
the
report
of
the
tax
court.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
statute
doesn't--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
statute
does
not
prohibit
the
disclosure
of
other
reports,
but
the
rule
clearly
does
not
require
the
disclosure
of
reports.
the
tax
court
in
1984
amended
the
rule
to
make
perfectly
clear
that...
that
initial
reports
of
special
trial
judges
are
not
to
be
disclosed.
the
tax
court
said
in
its
orders
in
this
case
the
reason
for
that
is
that
those
are
now
internal
deliberative
processes.
the
tax
court
has
made
clear
that
its
rules
permit
exactly
what
it's
doing
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
page
2a
of
the
appendix
to
the
gray
brief,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
section
7460(b)
provides
that
the
report
of
the
division...
and
the
tax
court
is
now
and
has
for
many
years
been
divided
into
one-judge
divisions.
they
used
to
sit
en
banc
or--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
for
a
brief
period
of
time,
they
sat
in...
in
panels.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but
they...
the...
the
press
of
work
force
them
to...
to
divide
into
one-judge
divisions.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
he...
he
prepares
it
and
submits
it
to
the
chief
judge
under
rule...
under
statute...
under
the
statute
7460(b)
where
it
says
the
report
of
the
division
shall
become
the
report
of
the
tax
court
within
30
days
after
such
report
by
the
division,
unless
the
chief
judge
directs
it
to
be
reviewed
by
the
full
court.
so...
so
even
a
tax
court
judge's
opinion
is
not
the
report
of
the
tax
court.
surely
the
report
of
the
special
trial
judge
is
not
either.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
the...
the
opinion
is
not
made
public.
in
fact,
the
statute
precludes
it
from
being
made...
made
a
part
of
the
record.
the
last
sentence
of
that
same
section
7460(b)
at
the
top
of
page
3a,
it
says
the
report
of
a
division
shall
not
be
a
part
of
the
record
in
any
case
in
which
the
chief
judge
directs
that
such
report
shall
be
reviewed
by
the
tax
court.
and
that's
a
very
important
point.
congress
has
mandated
by
statute
essentially
the
same
procedure
that
the
tax
court
follows
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the...
the
tax
court
judge
certainly
has
the
authority
to
dissent,
just
as
a
special
trial
judge
has
the
authority
and,
indeed,
the
obligation
under
the
code
of
conduct
to
refuse
to
put
his
name
on
a...
on
a
report
if
he
doesn't
agree
with
it.
if
he
doesn't
agree
with
the
tax
court
judge's
view,
he
has
the
obligation,
the
ethical
obligation...
and
we
presume
he
follows
it...
to
say
i
don't
agree.
this
is
my
report.
if
you--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
but
he
can
preclude
the
tax
court
judge
from
doing
what
the
tax
court
judge
did
in
this
case,
which
is
simply
adopting
his
report.
if
the...
if
the
special
trial
judge
refuses
to
change
his
report--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--justice
ginsburg,
if...
if
that
were
the
case
here,
obviously
our
arguments
would
be
more
difficult.
but
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
if...
if--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--in
the...
the
one
case
involving
a
change
in
the
opinion,
where
the
tax
court
judge
said,
i
don't
adopt
a
portion
of
the
opinion
of
the
special
trial
judge,
there
was
no
published
opinion
of
the
special
trial
judge.
so
i
don't
believe
there's
a
procedure
for
the
dissent.
but
the
point
is
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--a
published
dissent
by
a
special
trial
judge?
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
but
the
point
is
the
court
of--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
there's
often
a
dissent.
it's...
it's
hard
to
know
from
the
standpoint
of
a
researcher
when...
when
it
is
that
the
judge
who
heard
the
evidence
and
tried
the
case
is
the
one
who's
dissenting,
unless
they
happen
to
say
it
in
their
opinion,
because
again,
there's
no
original
opinion
issued
by
the
tax
court
judge
who
first
heard
the
case.
that's
kept
confidential
by
statute,
which
again
is
an
important
point.
congress
has
mandated
confidentiality
of
the
initial
reports
prepared
even
by
tax
court
judges,
and
it
has
given
the
tax
court
plenary
authority
to
promulgate
rules
governing
special
trial
judges.
it
is
hardly
surprising,
let
alone
impermissible
under
the
statute
or
due
process
clause,
for
the
tax
court
to
follow
a
similar
process
for
special
trial
judges.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
it's
identical.
the...
the
full
tax
court--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
neither
does
the
full
tax
court
when
it--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor.
the...
the
tax...
the
full
tax
court
doesn't
go
back
and...
and
hold
a
new
trial,
just
like
the
individual
tax
court
judges--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
then
if...
if
i
understand
the
point
you're
making,
it's
a
point
of
the...
the...
it's
the
hierarchy
issue,
if
that's...
if
that's
the
point
you're
making.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
so
did
the
tax
court
judge--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor.
that's
incorrect.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
in
a
review...
if
a
tax
court
judge...
most
tax
court
cases
are
tried
by
tax
court
judges.
tax
court
judges
are
trial
judges,
and
if
a
tax
court
judge
tries
a
case--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
i'm
talking
about
the
full
tax
court,
your
honor.
if
the
full
tax
court
reviews
an
individual
tax
court
judge's
decision,
the
tax
court
judge
has
presided
over
the
trial,
heard
the
evidence,
just
like
the
special
trial
judge
here,
and
then
the
full
tax
court
judge
reviews
it.
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
the
estate
of
varian
case,
which
is
in
our
briefs,
out
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
parties
complained
that
they
wanted
access
to
the
original
judge's
report
because
he
had
been
reversed...
been
reversed
by
the
full
court
after
trial
on
an...
on
an
evidentiary
issue,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
no.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you.
