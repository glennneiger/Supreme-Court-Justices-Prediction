justice
antonin
scalia
so
do
you
concede
that
if
shall
means
shall,
that
it
creates
a
property
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
wait.
i
thought
we
were
just
talking
here
about
state
law
as
to
whether
shall
means
shall.
do
you
think
that
it's
a
matter
of
state
law
whether,
if
it
does
mean
shall,
it
creates
a
property
interest
for
purposes
of
the
federal
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
concede
that
that's
a
state
question
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
what
you
mean
is
that
what
is
a
property
interest
for
purposes
of
colorado
law,
if
colorado
chooses
to
nominate
some
utterly
zany
thing
of
property
interest,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it's
a
property
interest
for
purposes
of
the
federal
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you
need
a
case
for
that,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
any
cases
involving
a
zany
property
interest
having
been
found
by
a
state?
i
don't
think
we
have
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
response
to
the
fact
that
the
tenth
circuit
found
otherwise
and
that
we
usually
defer?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
constitution
does
say
property
right.
i
mean,
it
has
to
be
a
property
right,
doesn't
it?
is
that
meaningless?
is
everything
in
the
world
either
life,
liberty
or
property?
does
that
describe
everything
in
the
world?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
because
there
has
been
no
case
that
really
did
not
involve
something
that
could
reasonably
be
called
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
state's
problem.
i
mean,
if
the
state
doesn't
want
that,
sure,
the
state
can
take
that
away.
but
if
the
state
does,
do
i
still
have
to
call
it
property
just
because
the
state
does?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
was
your
procedure,
assuming
your
entitled
to
a
procedure,
why
did
it
have
to
come
from
castle
rock?
why
wasn't
your
proper
recourse
to
the
court
that
issued
the
restraining
order?
did
you
try
to
do
that,
to
go
to
the
judge
that
issued
the
restraining
order
and
say,
the
police
are
not
enforcing
the
restraining
order
that
you
issued,
i
would
like
directive
from
the
court
that
they
enforce
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
just
as
she
could
have
complained
to
the
police
earlier,
she
could
have
gone
to
the
court
earlier
when
she
saw
that
the
police
weren't
doing
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be
a
tort,
but
it's
not
necessarily
a
denial
of
process
if
the
proper
place
to
seek
that
process
was
from
the
court
that
issued
the
restraining
order.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right,
and
the
court
can
make
sure
that
they
enforce
it
upon
complaint.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
reichel,
how
would
you
describe,
briefly,
the
property
that
your
client
has
been
deprived
of?
what
is
the
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
entitlement
to
enforcement
of
an
order
is
property?
do
you
know
any
case
that
is...
what's
the
closest
case
that
you
would
say
has
held
something
to
be
property
that
is
an
entitlement
to
have
an
order
enforced
as
opposed
to
an
entitlement
to
a
job,
an
entitlement
to
money,
an
entitlement
to
what
i
would
consider
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
it's,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
they
were
unemployment
benefits,
right?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
there
is
no
contract
here,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
case
no.
04-278,
town
of
castle
rock
versus
gonzales.
i
thought
castle
rock
was
a
1920s
dance
but
it
is
also
a
town
in
colorado.
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
facts
are
truly
horrible.
jessica
gonzales
the
respondent
sued
the
town
of
castle
rock
in
federal
district
court
alleging
that
the
town
had
violated
her
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause
when
its
police
officers
acting
pursuant
to
official
policy
in
customs
she
alleges
failed
to
respond
to
her
repeated
reports
over
several
hours
that
her
estranged
husband
had
taken
their
three
children
in
violation
of
her
restraining
order
against
him.
the
restraining
order
had
been
entered
as
part
of
a
divorce
proceeding.
it
generally
prevented
the
husband
from
coming
within
100
yards
of
the
family
home
and
it
allowed
him
only
limited
contact
with
the
children.
the
back
of
the
restraining
order
included
a
notice
for
law
enforcement
personnel
which
tract
the
statute
and
which
said
"you
shall
use
every
reasonable
means
to
enforce
this
restraining
order.
you
shall
arrest
or
if
an
arrest
would
be
impractical
under
the
circumstances,
seek
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
the
restrained
person
when
you
have
information
amounting
to
probably
cause
that
the
restrained
person
has
violated
any
provision
of
this
order."
early
one
evening
in
1999,
the
respondent's
husband
took
their
children
without
making
the
advance
arrangements
that
the
order
required.
respondent
first
called
the
police
at
about
7:30
that
evening.
when
officers
came
to
her
house,
she
showed
them
the
restraining
order
and
asked
them
to
enforce
it
and
return
her
children.
they
told
her
to
call
back
if
the
children
did
not
return
by
10:00
p.m.
she
called
again
at
8:30
p.m.
telling
them
that
she
had
spoken
to
her
husband
who
had
the
children
at
an
amusement
park
in
denver.
again,
they
told
her
to
call
if
the
children
were
not
returned
by
10:00
p.m.
shortly
after
10:00,
she
called
back,
but
was
now
told
to
wait
until
midnight.
she
called
again
at
midnight
and
again
at
12:10
a.m.
and
then
went
to
the
police
station
to
file
an
incident
report
at
12:50
a.m.
finally,
at
3:20
a.m.,
her
husband
showed
up
at
the
police
station
shooting
a
semi
automatic
handgun.
the
police
shot
him
dead
and
discovered
in
his
pickup
truck
the
bodies
of
all
three
children
whom
he
had
already
murdered.
respondent's
lawsuit
alleged
that
she
had
a
property
interest
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
in
the
enforcement
of
the
restraining
order.
the
district
court
concluded
otherwise
and
dismissed
the
suit.
on
appeal
however,
a
six
to
five
majority
of
the
en
banc
tenth
circuit
found
that
she
did
have
a
protected
property
interest
in
enforcement
of
the
terms
of
the
restraining
order
and
that
by
failing
to
give
serious
attention
to
her
request
to
enforce
the
order,
the
police
had
violated
her
due
process
rights.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
tenth
circuit.
the
due
process
clause
says
that
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
property
for
this
purpose
does
not
include
everything
that
might
be
described
as
a
governmental
benefit.
our
previous
cases
have
explained
that
an
individual
must
have
a
"legitimate
claim
of
entitlement"
to
the
benefit
and
that
such
entitlements
are
created
by
some
independent
source
such
as
state
law.
respondent
asked
us
to
defer
to
the
tenth
circuit's
conclusion
that
colorado
law
created
such
an
entitlement
here.
we
think
that
such
deference
is
inappropriate
in
this
case
because
the
tenth
circuit
decision
did
not
draw
upon
any
deep
well
of
state
specific
expertise
and
because
if
we
were
simply
to
accept
its
conclusion
we
would
necessarily
have
to
decide
conclusively
a
federal
constitutional
question.
we
conclude
that
colorado
law
did
not
give
respondent
an
entitlement
to
enforcement
of
the
restraining
order.
the
key
question
involves
the
statute
that
says
police
"shall
arrest
or
if
an
arrest
would
be
impractical
under
the
circumstances,
seek
a
warrant
for
the
arrest"
of
somebody
they
have
probably
cause
to
believe
has
violated
a
restraining
order.
there
is
a
well
established
tradition
of
law
enforcement
discretion
even
in
the
face
of
apparently
mandatory
arrest
statutes.
a
colorado
officer
would
likely
have
some
discretion
to
determine
that
the
circumstances
of
a
violation
or
competing
duties
counsel
against
enforcement
in
a
particular
instance.
the
practical
necessity
for
discretion
is
even
more
apparent
when
as
in
this
case,
the
violator
is
not
present
at
the
scene
and
his
whereabouts
are
unknown.
in
such
circumstances
the
statute
does
not
appear
to
require
officers
to
arrest
but
only
to
seek
a
warrant.
that
however,
would
be
an
entitlement
to
nothing
but
procedure
which
cannot
be
the
basis
for
a
property
interest.
the
judge
would
have
some
discretion
in
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
and
the
police
would
have
some
discretion
in
the
enforcing
of
it.
even
if
the
statute
could
be
set
to
make
enforcement
mandatory
for
the
police
that
would
not
necessarily
mean
that
respondent
has
an
entitlement
to
enforcement.
the
statute
speaks
of
protected
persons
but
only
in
connection
with
other
matters,
matters
other
than
enforcement.
in
particular,
it
speaks
directly
to
the
protected
person's
power
"initiate"
civil
contempt
proceedings
and
to
"request"
that
the
prosecutor
initiate
criminal
contempt
proceedings.
this
contrasts
telling
with
statutory
silence
about
any
power
on
the
part
of
the
protected
person
to
request
much
less
demand
that
an
arrest
be
made.
finally,
we
note
that
even
if
we
thought
otherwise,
about
colorado's
creation
of
entitlement
it
is
not
clear
that
an
individual
entitlement
to
enforcement
of
a
restraining
order
could
constitute
a
property
interest
for
purposes
of
the
due
process
clause.
such
a
right
would
have
no
ascertainable
monetary
value
and
would
arise
incidentally
out
of
a
function
that
government
actors
have
always
performed,
namely
the
function
of
arresting
people
who
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
have
committed
a
criminal
offense.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
joined
but
justice
breyer;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justice
ginsburg.
