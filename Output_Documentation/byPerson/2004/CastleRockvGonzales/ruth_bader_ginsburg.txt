justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
suggest
to
the
federal
court
that
it
certify
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
colorado
law
to
this
colorado
supreme
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
compare
it
to...
this
is
a
court
order
and
it's
enforceable.
there
is
no
question
about
that,
is
there?
this
is
a
court
order
that
enforcement
officials
carry
out.
how
does
it
differ
from,
say,
a
money
judgment
and
executing...
levying
execution
on
property?
judgment
creditor
says,
here
is
my
judgment,
marshal,
sheriff,
go
out
and
find
some
of
the
defendant's
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that
true
of
all
injunctive
orders,
they're
not
issued
to
the
police.
and
yet
the
police...
don't
the
police
have
an
obligation
to
enforce
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
discretion...
does
discretion
on
the
means
to
use
include
discretion
to
do
nothing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
were
any
of
those
determinations
made
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
are
you
requesting
that
there
are
insufficient
fact
findings
here,
so
it
should
be
returned--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
stop
you?
you
cited
that
linda
r.s.,
whatever,
i
thought
that
was
a
standing
case
saying
it's
not
going
to
do
you
any
good
to
have
them
locked
up
in
jail
if
what
you
want
to
do
is
get
money
from
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
good
is...
what
does
the
restraining
order
do,
then,
other
than
give
her
a
right
to
sue
the
person
who
is
restrained
for
contempt?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
only
to
ask
the
police
and
the
police
are
not
obliged
to
respond.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
be
precise
about
what
is
the
due
process?
you're
saying
it's
not
a
hearing
that
you're
seeking.
not
just
that
she
could
be
listened
to
and
no
action
taken.
but
what
precisely
is
the
process
to
which
she
is
due?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
on
any
timetable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
where
do
you
get
that?
i
know
that
the
tenth
circuit
tried
to
stick
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
but
where
do
you
get
the
requirement,
a,
that
police
inform
her
and,
b,
that
it
give
reasons
for
nonenforcement?
those
were
not
within
what
the
tenth
circuit
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
notice...
yeah,
did
it
say
with
a
statement
of
reasons?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
know
that
it
would
be
a
fair
process
that
you're
describing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
it
an
essential
one,
that
is,
that
nothing
spells
out...
in
most
of
the
cases
that
involve
property
and
a
procedural
due
process
right,
it's
a
hearing
that
the
person
is
seeking.
are
they
entitled
to
benefit
or
are
they
not?
but
here,
this
is
not
what
you
want.
you
want
the
police
to
enforce.
and
if
they
don't
enforce,
to
give
you
a
reason.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
police...
let's
say,
focusing
on
this
case,
suppose
they
had
looked
at
this
order
and
said,
wow,
it
gives
him
weekends
with
the
girls,
it
gives
him
summertime
with
the
girls
and,
subject
to
his
ex-wife's
agreement,
dinner
time
with
the
girls,
this
can't
be
all
that
urgent
because
if
he
would
harm
the
girls
then
why
is
the
judge
allowing
him
so
much
sole
time
with
them?
so
wouldn't...
looking
at
this
particular
order,
wouldn't
there
be
reasons
why
the
police
would
say,
the
judge
is
allowing
the
father
to
spend
time
with
the
girls,
this
can't
be
that
urgent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there
had
been
a
question
certified
to
the
colorado
supreme
court,
and
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
we
weren't
intending
to
create
any
entitlement
here,
evidence
that
we
don't
even
have
a
tort
action
that's
willful
or
wanton
conduct,
no
liability
at
all
in
the
municipality.
so
suppose
the
state
supreme
court
has
said,
we
didn't
mean
to
create
any
entitlement,
then
where
would
you
be?
