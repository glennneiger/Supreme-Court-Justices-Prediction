mr.
john
c.
eastman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
happened
here
is
undeniably
tragic.
a
father
shot
and
killed
his
own
daughters.
he
was
under
a
restraining
order,
so
the
issue
for
this
court
is
whether
the
order
restraining
mr.
gonzales
also
gave
to
mrs.
gonzales
and
her
children
a
property
interest
put
against
the
police
giving
mrs.
gonzales
an
entitlement
to
the
arrest
of
her
estranged
husband.
more
precisely,
the
issue
is
whether
the
state
of
colorado
intended
to
create
such
a
property
interest.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
well,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--well,
they
have
in
other
cases,
as
we
note
in
our
brief,
that
the
word
shall
is
not
always
mandatory,
particularly
here,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
when
we
have
such
a
backdrop
of
law
enforcement
discretion.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
not
in
particular
on
this
statute.
they
only...
the
colorado
case
law
on
the
word
shall
says
that
you
have
to
read
it
in
context
of
the
entire
statute.
and
here
the
word
shall
is
used
several
different
places
pointing
several
different
directions
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
no,
justice
scalia,
i
do
not.
there
is
a
long
way
between
giving
direction,
even
mandatory
direction,
to
law
enforcement
and
creating
a
property
interest.
i
think
that
was
the
essence
of
this
court's
holding
in
sandin.
and
it's
that
distinction
that
even
if
you
read
shall
in
these
statutes
as
requiring
a
particular
outcome,
and
we
don't--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--yes,
i
don't
think
here,
because
it's
not
just
an
application
of
colorado
law
here.
we
have
identical
statutes
in
19
or
20
different
states
around
the
country.
and
what
you
do--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--well,
what
you're
asking
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
that
created...
that
read
this
statute
shall,
without
any
colorado
court
interpretation,
and
did
so
without
any
greater
indication
from
the
colorado
legislature,
that
it
intended
more
than
just
to
give
direction
to
police.
it
intended
to
create
a
property
interest.
i
understand
the
question
from
bishop
versus
wood,
but
i
don't
think
we
can
defer
to
the
tenth
circuit
here
in
creating
something
that
colorado
did
not
intend
to
create.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
well,
but
i
think
there
is
a
big
difference.
i
mean--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--yes,
and
i
think
when
you're
looking
at
a
statute
such
as
this,
that
is
invoking
the
federal
court's...
i
mean,
what
we're
using
is
a
state
law
to
invoke
federal
protections.
and
i
think
it's
that
deference
to
the
state
that
i
think
is
more
critical.
and
i
don't
think
you
can
allow
the
federal
courts
to
make
that
decision
when
colorado
itself
has
not
been...
has
been
as
ambiguous
as
it
is.
i
think
we
need
a
clearer
statement.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
no,
we
did
not,
because
i
don't
think
the
statute
gets
us
over
the
hurdle
to
make
that
even
necessary.
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
that
is
intended...
that
uses
the
language
of
property
interest
or
entitlement.
i
think
if
this
court
would
look
to
its
decision
in
gonzaga,
for
example,
in
an
analogous
context--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--no,
justice
scalia,
i
don't.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
no.
and
what
we're
talking
about--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--well,
what
we
have
to
look
at
is
whether,
first,
the
state,
under
roth,
intended
to
create
a
property
interest
rather
than
just
giving
mandatory
direction
to
its
officers.
and
i
think
the
critical
question
there
is
what
the
default
rule
ought
to
be
on
a
statute
that
is
not
clear
on
that
question.
and
i
think
roth
tells
us
that
for
purposes
of
federal
constitutional
law,
the
default
cannot
be
that
we
assume
the
state
created
a
property
interest,
at
least
in
this
kind
of
nontraditional
property
interest.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
what
kind
of
property
interest
we're
talking
about.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
justice
breyer,
i
agree,
and
the
difference
between
even
mandatory
language
directing
law
enforcement
to
behave
in
a
certain
way
is
a
far
cry
from
actually
creating
a
property
interest
in
mrs.
gonzales
herself.
this
court
in
sandin
held
that
in
the
prison
context,
and
i
think
the
analogy
in
this
court's
implied
right
of
action
cases
such
as
gonzaga
is
a
good
one.
in
order
to
take
a
statute
and
try
and
find
a
property
interest,
we
would
want
to
have
it
phrased
in
terms
of
the
beneficiary
rather
than
the
person
restrained.
we
would
want
to
see
an
actionable
entitlement
created.
none
of
that
is
here.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
you
know,
the
analogy
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
and
the
u.s.
marshal
statute,
42
u.s.c.
1990
that
says
that
there
is
a
right
in
the
beneficiary
to
have
a
warrant
issued.
and
if
the
marshal
refuses
to
do
that,
that
he
can
be
challenged
and
held
to
a
thousand
dollar
fine
for
the
benefit
of
the
person
whose
arrest
warrant
he
was
supposed
to
serve.
now,
even
that
doesn't
quite
go
far
enough
because
there
is
not
a
private
right
of
action
by
the
beneficiary
about
a
warrant
to
bring
the
suit
directly.
but
at
least
that
kind
of
statute
is
getting
closer
to
acknowledging
a
property
interest.
this
is
enforceable
against
mr.
gonzales,
and
ms.
gonzales
could
go
back
in
and
get
a
contempt
proceeding.
i
know
here,
after
the
fact,
that's
not
going
to
do
any
good.
but
the
restraining
order
is
issued
against
mr.
gonzales.
it's
not
issued
to
the
police.
and
all
we
have
then
is
how
its
violation
by
mr.
gonzales
will
be
enforced.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
to
my
knowledge,
we've
never
held
that
the
police
have
an
actionable
obligation
to
enforce
them.
but
the
state--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--justice
souter,
they
still
have
a
great
deal
of
discretion
here.
the
statute
says
reasonable
means
of
enforcement.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
well,
let
me
take
your
invitation,
then,
and
respond
back.
i
mean,
if
the
terms
of
the
restraining
order
cut
out
all
of
the
discretion
whatsoever
and
that
they
specifically
are
written
in
terms
of
the
property
interest
creates
an
entitlement
in
the
beneficiary
of
the
restraining
order,
as
against
not
just
the
person
restrained
or
the
person
whose
property
is
going
to
be
attached,
but
an
entitlement
to
enforcement
by
the
police
itself,
then
i
think
we
would
be
on
the
step
toward
creating
a
property
interest.
the
colorado
statute
here
does
none
of
those
things.
it
continues
to
give
the
police
a
great
deal
of
discretion.
reasonable
means--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--well,
it
includes
a
finding
of
probable
cause.
it
includes
a...
seek
an
arrest
or
make
an
arrest
or
seek
a
warrant
arrest
when
the
arrest
is
impractical.
if
the
arrest
is
impractical,
such
as
when--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--well,
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know
because
this
case
comes
up
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
all
we
have
are
the
allegations.
the
allegations
are
that
they
didn't
enforce
the
restraining
order,
all
right?
but
we
don't
know
whether
it's
because
they
made
a
determination
of
no
probable
cause,
whether
there
was
probable
cause
but
because
he
wasn't
in
the
jurisdiction--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--no,
justice
ginsburg,
because
what
we're
saying
is
that
there
is
not
a
property
interest
at
all
and
it
doesn't
matter,
even
if
these
allegations
are
true,
there
is
no
underlying
property
interest
that
would
invoke
the
procedural
protections
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
justice
stevens,
you're
asking
whether,
for
purposes
of
federal
constitutional
law,
the
state
court
decision
that
colorado
had
created
a
property
interest
is
dispositive.
and
i'm
not
sure
it
is,
but--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--well,
no,
i
was
saying
that
yes,
you
would,
because
what
we're
talking
about
is
looking
to
the
state
legislature
on
whether
they've
created
a
property
interest
for
purposes
of
federal
law.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
okay.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
justice
scalia,
i'm
happy
to
do
that.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
no,
you
won't,
but
it
makes
perfect
sense--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--no,
but
it
makes
perfect
sense.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
what
we
want
to
find
out
is
whether
the
colorado--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--we
don't
even
have
any
cases
involving
a
property
interest
to
enforcement
against
somebody
else.
all
we
have
are
cases
to
the
contrary.
linda
r.s.,
for
example,
this
court
held
that
there
is
no
right
to
arrest
or
enforcement
against
somebody
else.
and
so
i
think
at
least
in
the
context
of
these
very
non-zany
property
interest
claims,
that
we
need
to
have
a
pretty
clear
statement,
not
even
from
the
colorado
courts,
but
from
the
legislature
itself
that
the
legislature
intended,
as
a
matter
of
state
policy,
to
have
a
property
interest
created
and
all
of
the
consequences
that
would
flow
from
that.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
it
was,
but
the
case
has
been
relied
on
by
several
subsequent
decisions
including
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
attica
case,
inmates
of
attica,
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
just
simply
no
right
to
an
enforcement
against
somebody
else,
that
there
is
no
entitlement.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
colorado
legislature
never
could
create
such
an
entitlement,
but
given
the
backdrop
of
linda
r.s.,
and
also
given
the
backdrop
of
traditional
law
enforcement
discretion,
i
think
we
need
a
much
clearer
statement
from
the
colorado
legislature
itself,
both
that
it's
written
in
terms
of
the
beneficiary...
getting
her
an
entitlement
against
the
police,
rather
than
in
terms
of
what
the
person
restrained
is.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
yes,
justice
o'connor,
it
does.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
there
are
several
remedies.
in
the
first
instance,
any
violation
of
a
restraining
order,
she
can
petition
the
court
for
a
contempt
order,
even
against
the
police.
if
their
conduct
was
willful
and
wanton--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--against
the
police
and...
not
the
town.
the
town
has
absolute
immunity
but
against
the
police
under
the
tort
statute,
the
police
are
not
immune
if
their
conduct
is
willful
and
wanton.
and
i
think
this
court
in
deshaney
addressed
that
very
question
when
it
looked
like
if
the
state
wanted
to
create
an
interest
here,
that
it
could
do
so
by
modifying
the--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--it
does.
and
there
is
a
colorado
governmental
immunity
act
that
gives
immunity
to
police
except
when
their
conduct
is
willful
and
wanton.
and
so
that
tort
remedy
does
exist
and
if
the
colorado
legislature
wanted
to
lower
the
threshold
on
that
and
make
it
negligent
omissions
or
what
have
you,
whatever
the
allegations
are,
they
could
do
so.
the
fact
that
they
haven't
done
so
i
think
is
a
pretty
strong
indication
that
they
did
not
intend
to
create
a
property
interest
here.
if
there
is
a
property
interest...
let
me
just
say
one
minute
about
the
procedures
that
were
given,
and
then
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
at
most
we
would
have
here,
if
there
is
a
property
interest,
is
the
opportunity
for
mrs.
gonzales
to
tell
the
police
that
she
believed
the
restraining
order
was
violated
and
that
they
responded
to
her
however
they
did.
she
received
whatever
process
might
be
due
assuming
we
have
a
property
interest
here.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
go
pack
to
justice
scalia's
point
about
the
property
interest.
this
is
such
a
unique
claim
of
a
property
interest.
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
find
that
even
if
you
were
to
accept
justice
stevens'
contention
of
a
contract,
an
adt
type
of
guarantee
of
protective
services,
that
looks
a
lot
more
like
the
type
of
entitlements
under
roth
that
this
court
has
recognized.
i
think
it
may
well
be
the
case
that
you
never
reach
a
property
interest
in
the
enforcement
against
somebody
else,
that
that's
a
different
thing
in
kind
from
this
traditional
contract
protective
services.
so
if
there
was
a
statute
that
said,
when
somebody
has
a
protective
order
that
implicates...
particularly
when
there
is
a
finding
of
dangerousness
that's
been
made
by
a
court
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
restraining
order
that
was
issued
here,
and
that
the
police
are
obligated
to
provide
24-hour,
seven
days
a
week
police...
squad
car
out
in
front
of
her
house
until
she
goes
to
testify
at
a
hearing,
for
example,
that
would
be
i
think
a
property
interest.
but
it
would
meet
the
criteria
that
this
court
set
out
in
gonzaga,
that
it's
defined
in
terms
of
rights
to
her,
not
just
benefits
that
might
flow
from
a
criminal
law
more
generally.
it's
phrased
in
terms
of
the
person
benefitting
and
it
has
an
unmistakable
focus.
that's
the
phrase
from
gonzaga.
and
that
there
is
an
intent
to
create
a
private
remedy
as
well,
not
just
the
private
right.
i
think
those
kind
of
things
would
give
rise
to
a
roth
type
property
interest
that
would
lead
to
the
invocation
of
procedural
due
process
requirements.
mr.
john
c.
eastman
i
believe
under
colorado
law,
that
would
show
willful
and
wanton
and
their
tort
claim
would
be
available
against
the
police.
but
it's
precisely
because
of
that
tort
claim
is
available
and
only
on
those
limited
circumstances
that
i
think
you
cannot
read
the
colorado
legislature
as
having
created
a
property
interest
here,
because
the
remedies
that
would
be
available
would
not
be
so
limited.
we
would
not
be
limited
to
willful
and
wanton
conduct.
we
would
have
all
sorts
of
remedies
beyond
what
the
state
of
colorado
specifically
said.
and
you
would
go
a
long
way
toward
making
constitutional
provisions
the
font
of
colorado
tort
law,
and
completely
supplant--
mr.
john
c.
eastman
--disfavor.
i
think
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
that
would
even
make
it
reasonable
for
the
colorado
supreme
court
to
hold
that
there
is
a
property
interest
here.
and
to
go
back
to
your
earlier
point
about
bishop,
it's
not
a
determinative
rule.
you
give
deference
to
the
tenth
circuit.
but
when
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
is
not
based
on
any
even
developments
in
colorado
law,
and
based
on
a
colorado
statute
and
takes
the
step
that
this
statute
simply
doesn't
comply
with,
i
don't
think
you
need
to
give
the
kind
of
absolute
deference
here
that
you
might
have
given
other
cases.
