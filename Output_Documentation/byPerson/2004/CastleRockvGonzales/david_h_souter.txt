justice
david
h.
souter
but
wouldn't
you
concede
that
in
the
case
of
the
injunction
in
which
there
is
a
specific
order
in
relation
to
a
specific
respondent,
that
the
police
have
much
less
discretion
than
they
would
have
when
there
is
in
effect
a
general
statute
saying,
respond
in
these
kinds
of
situations?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
case
of
the
statute
that
we're
talking
with,
but
they
don't
have
that
kind
of
discretion,
do
they,
in
justice
ginsburg's
example?
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
if
you're
going
to
take
the
example
that
justice
ginsburg
has
given
you
as
equivalent
to
the
example
that
we
have
before
us,
i
think
you're
fighting
uphill
and
i
don't
think
you
have
to
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
no,
please.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
the
kind
that
you've
brought,
as
i
understand
it.
as
i
understand
it,
you've
brought
a
claim
simply
that
she
was
hurt
and
was
not
given
process.
that's
all
you
have
to
prove.
if
you
can
prove
a
pattern,
sure,
it's
easy
to
prove
an
individual
case.
but
your
only
claim
is
damage
as
a
result
of
a
denial
of
some
procedural
right
in
this
case,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
not
a
class
action,
is
it?
it's
not
a
claim
under
some
statute...
civil
rights
statute.
it's
a
claim
for
the
benefit
of
this
client
and
if
this
client
wins,
this
client
presumably
will
get
a
money
judgment,
isn't
that
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'll
grant
you
that,
but
as
i
understand
it,
what
stands
between
or
what
would
stand
between
your
ignoring
complaint
and
success
would
simply
be
the
police's
statement
of
a
reason
because,
as
i
take
it,
i
take
it
that
you
don't
deny
she
was
heard,
they
answered
the
phone,
they
talked
to
her.
she
got
a
result.
after
she
had
talked
with
them
on
the
phone,
she
knew
that
they
weren't
going
to
do
anything
or
that
they
weren't
going
to
do
anything
satisfactory.
so
as
i
understand
it,
on
your
theory,
the
only
thing
she
didn't
get
that
she
would
be
entitled
to
would
be
a
statement
by
them
as
to
why
they
were
not
going
to
do
something
for
her.
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
they
had
said,
we
don't
think
there
is
probable
cause,
that
would
be
the
end
of
your
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
question
that
is
suggested
by
justice
scalia's
question.
and
it
goes
basically
simply
to
the
practical
problems
that
your
position
seems
to
entail.
you
answered
him
by
saying
that
the
point
at
which
she
realized
they
were
denying
her
whatever
she
was
entitled
to
was
the
point
at
which
the
children
were
dead.
how
would
a
reviewing
court
know
when
this
particular
right
had
been
denied?
i
take
it
from
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
that
there
had
not
been
a
denial
of
the
right
and
hence
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process
after
the
first
telephone
conversation.
i
take
it
from
your
answer
that
there
wasn't
one
after
the
second
conversation.
and
i
take
it
the
only...
that
there
was
no
ripening,
as
it
were,
of
the
facts
into
a
denial
of
what
she
was
entitled
to
until
the
3:00
a.m.
call,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
my
general
question,
then,
is
how
does
a
reviewing
court
determine
when
or
the
point
at
which
there
has
been
a
denial?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
following
the
first
phone
call,
they
would
have
to
have
made
an
express
probable
cause
determination?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
communicate
that
to
her.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
good
could
that
have
done
anyone?
justice
david
h.
souter
she
knew,
as
it
was,
that
they
weren't
going
to
do
anything.
what
good
would
it
have
done
her
to
know
that,
oh,
it's
nice
to
know
that
they've
gone
through
a
probable
cause
determination
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
they're
not
going
to
do
anything.
i
mean,
what
is
the
social
value
of
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
said
call
back
in
two
hours
and
whatnot.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
each
time
at
the
end
of
the
call,
she
knew
that
they
weren't
going
to
do...
they
weren't
going
to
go
out
and
look
and
they
weren't
going
to
enforce
the
order
at
that
point,
didn't
she?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
i
can
understand
you're
making
an
argument...
you
have
made
it,
but
i
can
understand
you're
making
an
argument
that
the
point
of
procedure
is
to
force
people,
in
this
case
the
police,
to
face
facts.
if
they
really
know
that
she
has
made
out
probable
cause
that
something
is
wrong
here,
if
they
are
forced
to
face
that
as
a
result
of
procedure,
they
will
then
do
something
about
it.
it's
not
as
easy
to
be
irresponsible
in
that
case.
but
the
trouble
with
that
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
although
it's
sound
as
far
as
it
goes,
is
that
it's
an
argument
that
would
apply
with
respect
to
every
statute
in
which
there
is
mandatory
language
to
the
police
to
enforce
it.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
suggest
a
completely
nonadministerable
system
and
one
which
is
totally
at
odds
with
the
normal
accord
of
police
discretion.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
how
do
you
get
around
that
dilemma?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
weren't
they
enacted
with
an
express
provision
saying,
and
by
the
way,
the
police
have
got
to
go,
either
through
the
following
procedure
or,
by
the
way,
this
statute
creates
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
protected
party.
in
other
words,
if
the
response
to
what
i
understand
the
problem
to
have
been,
if
the
response
was
the
response
that
you
think
the
legislature
made,
why
didn't
the
legislature
say
something
that
would
take
these
statutes
out
of
the
run
of
the
mill
criminal
law
statutes
in
which
the
police,
subject
to
mandatory
language,
have
an
apparent
obligation
to
do
something
to
enforce?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
doesn't
say
that
people
like
your
client
have
a
personal
right
to
enforcement
with
a
damage
remedy.
