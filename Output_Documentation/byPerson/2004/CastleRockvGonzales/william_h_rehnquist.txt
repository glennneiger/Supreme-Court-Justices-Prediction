we'll
hear
argument
on

04-278,
the
town
of
castle
rock
versus
jessica
gonzales.
mr.
eastman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
tort
statute
means
something
like
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
does
colorado
have
something
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
eastman.
mr.
elwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
sort
of
aggressive
sort
of
thing
that
the
colorado
courts
could
conclusively
decide.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
it
has.
thank
you,
mr.
elwood.
mr.
reichel,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
process
do
you
think
your
client
was
entitled
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
that
simply
be
made
by
the
person
on
the
desk?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
simply
have
to
take
her
word
as
to
the
facts
on
the
probable
cause
issue?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
a
moment
ago,
this
could
be
done
by
the
sergeant
on
duty
at
the
desk
who
probably
had
three
other
calls
waiting.
do
you
still
think
that
could
be
done?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
other
cases
besides
logan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
reichel.
mr.
eastman,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
eastman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
town
of
castle
rock
versus
gonzales
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
