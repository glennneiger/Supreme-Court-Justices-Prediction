are
there
any
extreme
cases
we
could
imagine
where
the
police
have
a
duty
to
protect
the
citizen?
the
policeman
sees
four
people
beating
up
on
the
victim,
no
race
involved,
and
he
just
enjoys
watching
the
fight.
does
he
have
a
duty
under
the
constitution
to
intervene?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
deshaney
stand
for
the
proposition
there
could
never
be
an
affirmative
duty
to
intervene,
under
what
you're
talking
about
the
constitution
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
has
to
be
some
state...
the
state
has
to
have
created
the
risk
somehow?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
your
complaint
is
the
result,
not
the
procedure.
it's
true
that
a
procedural
case
is
designed
so
that
the
right
result
can
be
reached
most
of
the
time.
i
understand
that.
but
all
we
ask
is
whether
or
not
the
procedure
was
added.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
state
cares
so
little
about
enforcing
what
its
officers
do
under
its
own
laws,
isn't
that
some
indication
that
it
did
not
intend
to
create
the
property
interest
that
you're
arguing
for?
