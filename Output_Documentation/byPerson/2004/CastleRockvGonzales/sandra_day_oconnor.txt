tell
us
how
we
know
exactly
how
much
discretion
the
state
of
colorado
wanted
to
give
to
the
police.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
without
a
statute
that
uses
the
word
shall
enforce.
do
we
know
how
colorado
has
interpreted
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
there
colorado
cases
that
tell
us
how
we
should
read
those
statutes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
eastman,
assuming
for
the
moment
there
is
no
due...
procedural
due
process
right
here,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
does
colorado
law
provide
any
alternative
remedy
for
mrs.
gonzales?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
would
that
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
she
could
presumably
ask
for
some
relief
under
that
notion,
against
the
police
and
possibly
the
town?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
this
is
such
a
new
sort
of
a
requirement
you're
seeking
us
to
develop
here.
i
just
don't
know
of
any
past
case
that
would
suggest
such
a
requirement
when
it
comes
to
law
enforcement
requests
by
citizens
of
police.
it
would
be
a
major
step,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
are
there
any
indications
that
any
of
the
police
in
this
instance
will
face
disciplinary
action
for
their
response
here?
