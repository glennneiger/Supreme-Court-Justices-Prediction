mr.
john
p.
elwood
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
two
reasons
the
holders
of
restraining
orders
lack
a
property
right
to
police
enforcement
of
those
orders.
first,
respondent's
claim
has
to
be
evaluated
in
light
of
the
fundamental
background
principles
that
private
citizens
lack
a
judicially
cognizable
interest
in
arrest
and
in
prosecution
of
third
parties.
and
that
executive
decisions
not
to
enforce
criminal
statutes
are
presumptively
beyond
the
scope
of
judicial
review.
nothing
in
the
colorado
statute
reflects
an
intent
to
depart
from
those
background
presumptions
and
to
create
an
individual
right
to
enforcement.
unlike
statutes
where
this
court
has
recognized
a
protected
property
interest,
the
provisions
at
issue
here
did
not
regulate
the
plaintiff
or
respondent,
but
rather
regulate
a
third
party.
and
the
provisions
do
not
mention
the
restraining
order
holder,
much
less
state
that
she
has
an
entitlement
to
review.
in
addition,
the
provisions
do
not
afford
the
holder
of
restraining
orders
procedural
protections
or
judicial
review
of
the
sort
that
this
court--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
it
does
two
main
things.
first
of
all,
it
gives
her
rights
against
her
husband
which
are
enforceable
through
contempt
and
are
enforceable
by
asking
the
police
to
enforce
them.
and
second,
which
has
the
benefit...
it
has
the
effect
basically
of
creating
a
new
arrest
statute
that
lowers
the
threshold
of
what
conduct
is
criminal
from
something
that
would
be
a
freestanding
crime
to
basically
just
violating
one
of
the
terms
of
the
order.
and
that
is
the
interest
the
restraining
order
gives
her.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that
is
correct.
she
has
the
ability
to
ask
the
police
to
enforce
the
order,
but
the
police
have
discretion,
under
our
reading
of
the
statute,
not
to
enforce
the--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--the
police...
i
don't
believe
that
the
police
have
any
sort
of
actionable
duty.
i
think
that
what
the
statute
creates
is
basically
it's
a
direction
from
the
legislature
that
this
is
what
they
want
them
to
do.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
if
they
were
to
do
that,
i
do
not
think
that
there
would
be
sort
of
any
individual
right
to
challenge
that.
i
think
that
they
would
be
adopting
a
policy
decision
that
would
probably
be
different
than
the
one
the
colorado
legislature
has
made--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that's
something
the
colorado
courts
decide,
and
it's
something
that
would
be...
that
could
be
addressed
through
the
political
process
as
well.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
any
duty
that
there
would
be
would
be
a
substantive
duty.
and
this
court
indicated
in
deshaney
that
it
would
require
basically
state
creation
of
the
harm
or
state
increasing
the
vulnerability
of
the
person.
so
for
example--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
it
would
be,
in
a
case,
for
example,
where
a
prisoner
was
handcuffed
in
his
cell
with
a
cell
mate
who
the
authorities
knew
to
be
basically
interested
in
harming
him.
because
they
had
affirmatively
restrained
him,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
case
where
the
state
had
created
the
danger
or
increased
the
vulnerability.
so
i
think
there
is
something
left
to
the
requirement
of
police
protection
substantively
under
deshaney.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
under
deshaney,
the
state
has
to
have
created
the
risk
or
increased
the
vulnerability
of
the
person.
now,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
colorado
statute
does
not
speak
to
the
plaintiff,
it
essentially
speaks
to
the
restrained
party.
and
under...
as
mr.
eastman
mentioned,
under
gonzaga
and
this
court's
1983
cases,
that
when
a
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
the
regulated
party
instead
of
the
protected
party,
there
is
no
implication
of
an
intent
to
create
a
federal
right.
and
i
think
that
that
principle
would
apply
even
more
clearly
in
the
context
of
the
state
rights,
because
there
there
is
a
question
of
imposing
federal
liability
which
shouldn't
really
be
done
in
the
absence
of
an
indication
that
the
state
really
meant
to
do
that.
another
reason
is...
not
to
assume
that
there
is
a
property
right
here,
is
that
the
state
statute
does
not
create
any
sort
of
procedural
remedies
or
judicial
remedies
which
this
court
has
in
the
past
taken
as
an
indication
that
the
state
really
did
mean
to
create
a
protective
right.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
our
response
would
be
that
it's
not
simply...
well,
first
of
all,
i
don't
want
to
make
too
much
of
the
fact
that
it's
obviously
a
very
close
question
of
state
law
because
the
tenth
circuit
was
divided
by
a
single
vote.
but
even
aside
from
that,
you
basically
have
to
adopt
not
simply
a
question
of
what
the
state
law
says,
but
what
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
do
with
it.
and
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
given
what
a
tremendous
departure
it
would
be,
what
a
procedural
innovation
it
would
be
to
give
complaining
witnesses
essentially
a
right
in
the
process,
that
in
the
absence
of
a
very
clear
statement,
the
federal
court
should
not
imply
a
right
or
imply...
should
not
infer,
rather,
that
the
state
legislature
intended
to
create
a
right.
so
essentially,
what
we're
asking
for
is
a
clear
statement
rule.
and
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
statement,
we
should
presume
that
the--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--obviously,
i
think
there
would
be
a
much
closer
question
at
a
minimum.
there
may
be
something
to
the
fact
that
we
should...
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
we
would
want
a
statement
from
the
colorado
legislature.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
it
would
be
binding.
i
mean,
it
would
still
be
the
federal
question
of
whether
that
applied
federal
law
correctly.
but
given
that
it's
basically
a
question
of
what
is
a
state
property
right,
yes.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that
is
correct.
there
is
something
of
a
federal
overlay
to
sort
of
correct
that
at
the
margin--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
basically
they
said
that
because
it
is...
because
the
statute
was
mandatory,
they
basically
leapt
from
that
to
an
inference
that
because
it
was
mandatory,
it
was
a
duty
that
she
could
enforce.
but
there
is
no
tradition
in
that--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
don't
think
that
they
need
to
because
that
is
something
that,
again,
it
would
be
a
useful
thing
given
that
there
are
50
legislatures
out
there
and
there
are
probably
at
least
20
and
perhaps
31
similar
statutes
that
rather
than
certify
the
question
and
then
have
to
certify
on
a
state-by-state
basis,
just
to
adopt
a
background
rule
that
this
court
applies.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
well,
i
think
the
rule
that
the
court
could
create
is
that
in
a
criminal
context,
which
is
all
that
is
at
stake
here,
there
is
a
background
presumption
that
individuals
lack
a
judicially
cognizable
right
to
arrest
or
prosecution.
for
example,
an
arrest
warrant,
although
there
is
some
question
about
whether
or
not
that
really
is
mandatory.
it's
certainly
couched
in
mandatory
terms.
it's
directed
to
the
marshal.
to
the
marshal,
you
are
hereby
commanded
to
arrest
jane
doe
or
whoever.
but
there
is
a
very
established
body
of
law
that
even
the
people
who
basically
agitate
for
the
arrest
warrant
don't
have
a
grounds
to
complain
if
the
arrest
warrant
isn't
executed.
at
the
federal
level,
there
is
leek
versus
timmerman,
where
the
court
held
there
is
no
protective
interest
or
there
is
no
cognizable
interest
in
the
arrest
of
another
party.
and
at
the
state
level,
there
is
a
lot
of
case
law
indicating
that
officers
are
not
liable
to
private
citizens
for
failure
to
execute
arrest
warrants.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
that
is
correct.
this
court
has
not
placed
really
many
limits
on
what
kind
of
rights
could
be
created
under
roth.
there
is
some
indication
in
cases
like
sandin
that
there
might
be
limits
at
the
margins
or
rather
at
least
limits
presumptively--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--justice
scalia,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
roth
cases
haven't
really
indicated
that
there
might
be
limits
on
that.
i
think
that
there
are
reasons--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--correct.
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
case
where
courts
might
want
to
exercise
some
caution
because
there
is
a
reason
why
they
don't
involve
private
citizens
in
the
prosecution.
and
that
is
because
our
system
is
built
around
the
idea
that
to...
basically,
we
want
to
interpose
brakes
between
the
complaining
witness
and
the
courts
and
power
of
the
state,
as
the
court
indicated
in
young
versus
united
states
ex
rel.
vuitton.
the
prosecutor
there,
because
it
was
a
prosecutor,
basically
serves
as
a
circuit
breaker
to
prevent
people
from
going
straight
to
the--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
that
you
would
require
a
much
clearer
statement
before
accepting
that
kind
of
procedural
innovation.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
