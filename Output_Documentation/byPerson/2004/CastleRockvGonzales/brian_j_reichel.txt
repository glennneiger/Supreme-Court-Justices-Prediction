mr.
brian
j.
reichel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
public
high
school
student
threatened
with
suspension
receives
more
process
under
this
court's
holding
in
goss
versus
lopez
than
castle
rock
is
willing
to
provide
to
a
holder
of
a
court-issued
protective
order.
instead
of
providing
ms.
gonzales
with
any
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
any
meaningful
manner,
castle
rock
repeatedly
ignored
ms.
gonzales's
pleas
to
have
her
children
returned
to
her
and
the
restraining
order
enforced.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
we
believe
that
what
my
client
seeks
is
much
less
than
what
police
officers
do
every
day.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
ms.
gonzales
was
entitled
to
an
objective,
reasoned
and
good
faith
consideration
of
her
complaint
of
a
restraining
order
violation,
and
a
good
faith
assessment
of
probable
cause.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
it
can,
your
honor,
but
it
needs
to
be
a
probable
cause
determination
that
is
actually
communicated
to
the
holder
of
the
restraining
order,
whether
it
be
a
favorable
or
adverse
determination,
there
needs
to
be
some
notice
provided
to
the
holder
of
a
restraining
order
of
what
the
police
officers
intend
to
do.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
we're
asking
for
a
specific
process
here.
and
ms.
gonzales
wants
the
right
to
prove
a
pattern
and
practice
on
the
part
of
castle
rock
of
not
responding
properly
to
complaints
and
pleas
of
this
type.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
as
the
case
stands
now,
it
is
a
monell
claim,
your
honor.
it
is
a
pattern
and
practice
claim.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
yes,
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
you
are
correct.
but
the
ignoring
here,
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
your
honors,
is
that
castle
rock
has
this
custom
and
policy,
this
pattern
and
practice
of
just
ignoring
these
types
of
complaints.
and
the
ignoring,
as
the
law
enforcement
amicus
brief
filed
on
our
behalf
points
out,
the
ignoring
is
a
classic
example
of
how
police
have
traditionally
responded
to
these
types
of
complaints.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
no.
what
it
boils
down
to,
your
honor,
is
we're
looking
for
a
probable
cause
determination
to
be
made
in
good
faith.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
as
long
as
there
was
a
good
faith
determination.
if
there
was
a
mistaken
belief
that
there
was
a
lack
of
probable
cause,
then
there
is
no
violation
of
due
process.
the
process
has
been
provided.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
a
thoughtful,
objective--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--they
should
respond
by
making
an
objective
probable
cause
determination--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--they
should
have
made
the
probable
cause
determination.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
there
was
no
procedure
here,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
point
of
our
lawsuit
is
that
the
fact
that
castle
rock
has
an
official
custom
and
policy
of
ignoring,
of
not
applying
any
procedure
to
these
types
of
claims
is
the
crux
of
our
complaint
in
this
case.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
at
the
point
at
which
she
realized
the
police
weren't
really
going
to
do
anything,
she
found
out
her
children
were
dead.
that
would
have
been
at
that
point
in
time
a
meaningless
process.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
but
the
police
told
her
to
continue
to
wait.
they
strung
her
along,
your
honor.
that's...
the
crux
of
the
problem
here
is
that
she
relied
upon
the
police
to
enforce
her
restraining
order.
they
told
her
to
hold
on--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--but
the
restraining
order
has
no
meaning,
your
honor,
unless
the
police
are
willing
to
enforce
it.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
in
this
case,
it's
our
position
that
the
legislature
has
done
so
as
well.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
no,
your
honor,
and
i
apologize
if
i
misstated...
if
i
gave
you
that
impression.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
the
initial
contact
with
the
police
department
we're
saying
has
to
involve
appropriate
processes--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--they
would
have
had
to
have
made
a
probable
cause
determination
in
good
faith
and
conveyed
and
communicated--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--communicated
that
to
her,
which
they
never
did.
instead
they
just
kept
telling
her,
you
can
call
back
later,
call
back
later.
they
never
made
the
probable
cause
determination
and
conveyed
it
to
her.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that
the
whole
intent
of
goss
versus
lopez
was
to
allow
a
high
school
student
to
understand
the
interpretation
of
the
principal's
view
of
the
facts,
and
allow
the
student
the
opportunity
to
clarify
or
to
fill
in
any
missing
points
in
terms
of
the
understanding
being--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--your
honor,
we're
not
asking
for
the
court
to
instruct
the
police
department
they
have
to
draw--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--your
honor,
if
i
could
respond,
the
delay
issue
is
not
the
crux
of
the
problem.
the
crux
of
the
problem
is
that
the
police
officers
here
never
told
ms.
gonzales
that
they
believed
that
there
was
or
was
not
probable
cause.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
it
would
have
allowed
her
the
opportunity--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
the
record
is
such
that
we've
alleged
that
ms.
gonzales
knew
that
they
weren't
going
to
do
anything.
in
fact,
it's
just
the
opposite,
that
she
relied
upon--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--and
she
continued
to
do
that,
to
follow
their
instructions.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
i'm
not
sure
that's
correct.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
your
honor--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--we
believe
that
the
process
test
that
we're
articulating
here
is
unique
to
domestic
violence
mandatory
arrest
statutes
across
the
country.
the
reason
being
is
that
these
statutes
were
enacted
precisely
because
of
this
problem,
the
problem
of--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--i
would
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
that
they
have,
especially
in
colorado.
this
statute
is
much
more
detailed
than
a
run
of
the
mill
criminal
or
civil
statute.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
but
the
fact
that
there
is
a
court
order
here
in
place
individualizes
the
entitlement.
it
makes
it
personal.
ms.
gonzales
went
into
court
and
aired
her
dirty
laundry
under
the
assumption,
mistakenly
here,
that
she
was
going
to
be
provided
protection
from
the
state.
that
if
she
went
in
and
explained
the
situation
to
the
courts,
the
courts
would
issue
her
an
order
that
meant
something.
and
it
could
only
mean
something
if
police
officers
are
willing
to
enforce
it.
the
legislature
in
turn
has
said,
if
a
person
has
this
kind
of
order,
you
shall
use
every
reasonable
means
to
enforce
it.
now,
in
order
to
enforce
it,
the
police
officers
are
going
to
have
to,
as
they
respond
to
every
criminal
complaint,
make
an
initial
probable
cause
determination.
that's
part
of
every
day
law
enforcement.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
the
property
is
an
entitlement
to
enforcement
of
her
order.
that's
the
property,
your
honor.
that's
how
it
was--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--there
is
no
opinion
of
this
court
that
talks
about
orders
per
se.
there
is,
however,
what
i
would
classify
as
a
more
quirky
property
interest,
and
that
was
the
logan
versus
simmerman
brush
case.
that
case
dealt
with
the
situation
where
there
was
a
statute
that
provided
a
cutoff
for
when
somebody
could
sue
for
unemployment
benefits
or
discriminatory
allegations
in
the
state
of
illinois.
and
the
court
there
held
that
while
there
is
really
a
right
in
this
process,
to
go
through
this
process
and
by
cutting
it
off
without
any
opportunity
for
notice
or
a
hearing,
the
state
of
illinois--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--that's
true.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
well,
your
honor,
that's
true,
although
when
she
went
into
court,
i
think
she
believed
that
she
had
a
contract
with
the
state
of
colorado,
at
least
a
promise
by
the
state
of
colorado
that
she
would
obtain
some
protection.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
exactly.
and
here
the
order--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--there
is
no
contract
but
there
is
an
order.
there
is
a
court
issued
order
based
upon
her
allegations
and
based
upon
her
submissions
to
the
court.
your
honors,
again,
ms.
gonzales
took
the
risk
here
of
seeking
an
order
of
protection
and
airing
her
dirty
laundry
in
public,
and
she
did
so
with
the
reasonable
expectation
that
the
order
meant
something,
that
law
enforcement
would
enforce
it.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
we
believe
that
there
has
to
be
an
objective,
thoughtful,
reasoned
evaluation
of
her
complaint
of
a
violation.
and
that
involves
necessarily
an
evaluation
in
good
faith
of
probable
cause,
a
determination
of
whether
probable
cause
exists,
an
articulation
of
that
determination--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--certainly,
your
honor.
i
believe
if
you
take
a
look
at
some
of
the
model
policies
already
in
place
by
police
departments
around
the
country
that
are
attached
to
the
amicus
brief
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
that
filed
on
our
behalf,
you'll
see
some
policies
whereby
the
person
at
the
desk
taking
the
information
is
required
to
have
certain
types
of
questions
and
provide
certain
types
of
responses
to
those
questions.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
yeah,
we're
not
asking
for
the
police
department
to
drop
everything.
we're
just
asking
that
they--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
there
has
to
be
an
articulation
of
the
determination
of
probable
cause
to
the
holder
of
the
restraining
order
to
allow
her
to,
for
example,
clarify
facts,
to
perhaps
talk
to
a
superior
or
perhaps,
in
this
case,
go
somewhere
else
for
help,
go
to
the
court.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
i
believe
it
was
wrapped
within
the
concept
of
a
probable
cause
determination.
and
they
did
specifically
state
that
if
there
was
an
adverse
determination,
that
notice
of
that
determination
has
to
be
conveyed
to
her.
that
was,
i
believe,
the
fourth
prong
of
our
analysis.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
with
a
statement
of
reasons,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
well,
the
statement
of
reasons,
your
honor,
allows
again
for
there
to
be
communication
on
both
sides.
so
that
if
the
statement
of
reasons
turned
out
to
be
based
upon
false
information--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--a
meaningful
process.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
well,
i
believe
that
the
enforcement
of
the
order
flows
from
the
probable
cause
determination.
the
obligation
to
enforce
is
triggered
by
a
finding
of
probable
cause
of
a
violation.
so
the
process
we're
looking
for
involves
the
probable
cause
determination.
it's
our
position
that
by
simply
ignoring
that
process,
you're
depriving
somebody
potentially
of
their
property
right
in
enforcement
of
the
order.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
there
could
have
been,
your
honor,
but
again,
those
reasons
were
never
articulated
to
my
client
and
any
reasons
the
police
officers
may
have
had
are
not
in
the
record.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
it
would
be
a
different
kind
of
case,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
i
really
have
no
idea,
your
honor.
i
really
have
no
idea.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
as
was
conceded
in
petitioner's
reply
brief,
they're
really
under
our
governmental
immunity
laws.
they're
probably
the
strictest
in
the
country.
there
really
is
no
viable
tort--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--i
believe
that
centers
more
around
the
causation
and
foreseeability
issues
that
are
triggered
by
that
type
of
a
claim.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
at
all.
and
in
fact,
again,
going
back
to
some
of
the
court's
prior
cases
and
the
roth
series
of
case
law,
if
you
look,
for
example,
at
logan
versus
simmerman
brush,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
about
whether
there
was
a
tort
law
remedy
and,
in
fact,
there
was
in
that
case.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
on
that
issue?
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
not
with
that
elaborate
of
a
discussion
on
the
issue,
although
i
would
submit
that
the
existence
of
a
post-depravation
remedy,
so
to
speak
here,
is
irrelevant
under,
again,
logan,
simply
because
we're
left
now
with
the
monell
claim.
we're
left
with
the
allegations
of
state
action,
a
custom
and
policy
of
a
state
entity
here.
and
the
existence
of
a
post-depravation
state
law
tort
remedy
is
irrelevant
to
the
analysis
of
whether
there
is
a
due
process
violation.
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
we
probably
wouldn't
be
here,
your
honor.
that
question
simply
never
got
certified
to
the
tenth
circuit.
and
i
believe
you
do
have
to
give
deference
to
the
tenth
circuit's
analysis
of
colorado
law
on
that
issue.
your
honors,
at
issue
here
is
a
specific
order
of
protection,
a
legislative
mandate
requiring
enforcement
of
a
protective
order
and
a
pattern
and
practice
of
the
castle
rock
police
department
of
ignoring
and
failing
to
enforce
court
issued
protective
orders.
this
case
does
not
turn
on
decisions
made
by
police
officers
based
solely
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
case
involves
allegations
of
a
pattern
and
practice,
an
official
policy
and
custom
on
the
part
of
castle
rock
of
not
taking
complaints
of
restraining
order
violations
seriously.
this
pattern
and
practice
that's...
in
and
of
itself
proves
there
was
no
process.
ms.
gonzales
merely
seeks
the
opportunity
to
prove
at
a
trial
on
the
merits
that
no
matter
what
she
said
to
the
castle
rock
police
officers,
they
were
not
going
to
do
anything
about
her--
mr.
brian
j.
reichel
--at
this
point
in
time,
i
suppose
i
would
disfavor
it,
because
i
believe
that
bishop
versus
wood
is
controlling.
your
honors,
we
respectfully
request
that
this
honorable
court
affirm
the
tenth
circuit's
ruling
in
this
matter.
