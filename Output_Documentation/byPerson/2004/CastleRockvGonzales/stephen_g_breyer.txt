justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
shall
does
mean
shall.
fine.
but
you
might
have
a
statute
that
says
the
fire
department
shall
respond
to
fires,
the
police
department
shall
respond
to
crimes,
the
army
shall
respond
to
attacks.
even
the
word
shall
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
this
is
the
kind
of
interest
that,
like
property,
the
duke
of
rutland
relied
upon
blackacre,
that
welfare
recipients
rely
upon
continuing
to
receive
money.
what
is
it
about
this
that
makes
it
like
property,
even
if
shall
does
mean
shall?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
eastman,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
supposing
this
case
came
to
us
through
the
colorado
state
system
instead
of
through
the
federal
system,
and
the
colorado
supreme
court
had
written
precisely
the
same
opinion
that
the
tenth
circuit
ruled.
would
we
have
jurisdiction
to
overturn
their
holding
that
there
was
a
property
interest
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
did
they
hold
in
the
tenth
circuit?
i
mean,
shall
could
be
mandatory.
you
can
have
a
mandatory
duty,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
victim
has
a
legal
right
to
enforce
that
duty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
did
they
hold
in
the
tenth
circuit
in
respect
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
should
reask
the
certified
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
a
background
rule
is
awfully
tough.
i
mean,
you
could
have
lots
of
shalls
in
all
kinds
of
statutes.
if
they
said
shall,
the
sanitation
department
shall
inspect
your
home
for
tuberculosis,
maybe
that
does
give
a
right.
if
they
say
to
the
fire
department,
you
shall
put
out
fires,
i
wouldn't
think
they
meant
that
every
possible
homeowner
had
a
right
to
a
lawyer
and
a
full
judicial
hearing
before
they
go
and
respond
to
an
alarm.
you
know,
i
mean,
it
depends
on
the
area.
i
don't
know
how
to
create
a
background
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
does--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
basic
problem
that
i
have
is
you
just
put
your
finger
on.
i
mean,
on
your
view
of
the
facts
here,
which
i
will
accept,
it's
outrageous
what
happened
and
a
terrible
tragedy,
but
it
wasn't
that
they
didn't
hear
her.
they
heard
her.
that's
the
problem.
they
heard
her
and
they
didn't
do
anything.
so
if
you
proceed
under
state
law,
you
will,
if
you're
right,
get
a
holding
that
the
police
behaved
very
badly,
that
would
help
your
client,
and
it
would
help
future
people
in
the
same
position.
if
you
proceed
under
federal
law,
the
most
you
get
is
somebody
at
the
desk
saying,
well,
we
think
other
things
are
more
important.
and
at
that
point,
your
client
may
or
may
not
be
helped
and
other
people
won't
be
helped.
so
don't
you
have
a
misfit
between
the
remedy
that
you're
trying
to
get
and
the
harm
that
was
done?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
they
just
say,
look,
in
our
experience,
children
come
home
in
two
or
three
hours
and,
moreover,
we
have
other
things
to
do
that
are
more
important.
is
that
a
sufficient
answer?
both
things,
by
the
way,
most
people
who
look
into
this
would
say
are
completely
wrong.
but
i
mean,
the
police
would
say
just
what
i
said.
is
that
sufficient?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
you
really
want
is
what
they
should
do,
is
they
should
respond?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
this
case,
you
would
say
they
should
respond?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
goss
versus
lopez,
to
my
knowledge...
you
may
know
more
about
it.
but
to
my
knowledge,
there
are
not
a
lot
of
federal
cases
which
second
guess
the
principal
or
the
teacher,
once
the
teacher
or
the
principal
gives
a
plausible
reason
for
suspending
the
student.
and
of
course
my
fear
is
that
that
is
precisely
what
would
occur
here.
there
would
be
procedure,
there
would
be
a
reason.
the
reason
is
we're
too
busy.
all
right?
and
courts
won't
second
guess
that.
but
if
you
take
the
other
route,
you
get
what
you
need,
which
is
an
instruction
to
the
police
department
that
when
a
child
is
missing,
you
don't
wait.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
that
instruction
on
this
procedural
route.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
problem,
because
you
have
a
case
where
the
problem
was
the
delay
and
that's
apparently
a
common
problem.
and
i
don't
see
how
this
route
that
you
take
gets
at
that
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
still
bring
a
state
tort
suit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
because
it
is
willful
and
wanton,
and
you've
made
out
a
claim
they
didn't
even
give
an
answer,
they
didn't
do
anything,
they
have
a
practice
of
doing
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
willful
and
wanton...
suppose
the
facts
were
just
as
they
say,
long-standing
practice,
not
responding,
doing
nothing,
doing
nothing
here
despite
evidence
of
serious
danger,
and
being
told
you
shouldn't
do
anything,
don't
pay
any
attention
he'll
come
home,
would
that
show
willful
and
wanton?
