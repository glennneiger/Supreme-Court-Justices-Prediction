mr.
eastman,
would
you
comment
on
the
extent
of
deference
that
we
should
give
to
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
colorado
while
in
view
of
what
we
said
in
bishop
against
wood?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
colorado
statute
is
the
one
that's
controlling
in
this
case
and
normally,
at
least
according
to
bishop
against
wood,
we
defer
to
the
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
the
issue
of
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that's
the
issue,
whether
colorado
intended
to
create
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
reading
in
bishop
against
wood
was
really
counterintuitive
also,
as
the
dissenters
pointed
out,
as
you
would
agree,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
that
what
we
squarely
held
in
bishop?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
your
answer
is
no,
we
would
not
have
jurisdiction
in
that
event.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
could
say
that
they
had
misconstrued
colorado
law?
i
don't
think
you
really
mean
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
think
you
meant--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
can
do
that,
but
you
won't
find
any
cases
making
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
have
cases
saying
the
contrary.
that's
the
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
the
police
have
any
duty
at
all,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
the
police
just
issue
an
order
saying
ignore
all
orders
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
that
if
this
case
stands
with
the
state
system,
we
would
have
to
accept
their
holding
on
the
property
right
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
let's
say
the
supreme
court
has
said,
this
is
what
the
statute
means
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
wouldn't
that
be
binding
on
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
whether
the
question
of
property
right...
the
property
right
issue
is
not
a
question
of
federal
law,
it
is
a
question
of
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
the
colorado
legislature
could
create
such
a
right
if
it
did
it
with
sufficient
specificity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
the
better
analogy
be
to
assume
she
made
a
contract
with
a
private
detective
agency
to
protect
her
from
these
events.
and
if
something
arises,
to
go
get
the
police
and
act
on
it?
that
would
be
a
property
right
if
she
had
a
private
contract
with
a
private
detective
agency
to
do
exactly
what
the
police
were
supposed
to
do
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
a
contract
for
protection
would
be
a
familiar
kind
of
property,
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly,
i
know
what
the
allegations
are
here,
but
if
the
evidence
should
show
later
on
that
in
response
to
one
of
these
telephone
calls,
the
desk
sergeant
said,
send
a
squad
car
out
and
see
if
you
can
locate
the
kids,
you
would
lose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that
would
have
been
a
good
faith
response
by
somebody
to
try
and
find
out
whether
there
was
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
would
favor
or
disfavor
our
certifying
the
question
whether
there
is
a
property
right
here
to
the
colorado
supreme
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
opponent?
would
you
favor
or
disfavor
our
certifying
the
property
law
issue
to
the
colorado
supreme
court?
