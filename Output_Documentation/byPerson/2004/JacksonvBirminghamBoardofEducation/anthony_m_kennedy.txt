of
course,
the
question
is
whether...
that...
that
may
be
true,
but
there
would
be
an
administrative
remedy.
the
question
here
is
a
private
cause
of
action
for
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even...
even
assuming
the...
the
validity
of
your
premise,
you
still
have
another
step.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
that's
again
the
question
of
the
substantive
scope
of
the
provision,
and
that's
different
from
whether
there
was
a
congressional
intent
to
create
a
private
cause
of
action
for
this
sort
of
violation.
and
was
it...
virginia
bankshares
and
so
forth
tells
us
that
this
is
not
the
heyday
of
prior
cause
of
actions
anymore.
you
have
to
show
that
there's
a
congressional
intent
in
the
spending
clause
to
create
a
private
cause
of
action
for
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's...
that's
quite
separate
from--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--from
this...
from
the
question
of
substantive
liability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
saying
the
coach
cares
more
about
it
than
the
government
does?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if...
if
the
government
is
charged
with...
with
just
spending
the
funds
and
doesn't
think
that
this
is
worth
its
time,
why
should
there
be
a
private
cause
of
action--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when...
when
a
private
cause
of
action
is
harder
for
us
to
imply
than
it...
than
it
is
to
an
administrative
remedy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
have
been
under
title
vi?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
certainly
did
not
with
a
spending
clause
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
about
virginia--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
about
virginia
bankshares?
