justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
thought...
i
thought
that
cannon...
we've...
we've
allowed
cannon
to
stay
on
the
books,
but
i
thought
we
have
sworn
off
the
kind
of
creation
of...
of
implied
remedies
that
cannon
exemplifies.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very...
it's
very
useful,
i'm
sure,
but
it...
it
could
be
very
disruptive
also,
i
am
sure.
if
i
were...
if
i
were
a
coach,
one
of
the
first
things...
especially
a
coach
of
a
women's
team
in
high
school,
one
of
the
first
things
i
would
do
would
be
to
complain
about
not...
not
getting
enough
facilities.
this
would
make
it
a
lot
more
difficult
to
fire
me
whether...
whether
i'm
a
lousy
coach
or
not.
you...
you
would
have
to
think
twice
before
you
fire
me
because
i
would
have
a
retaliation
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
them
specifically
provide
for
retaliation,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
they
do
that
if,
as
you
assert,
the
mere
word
discrimination
embraces
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
it...
it
is
a
reasonable
description
of
what
happened...
he
was
fired
for
complaining
about
his
girls'
team
not
getting
enough
facilities...
that
he
was,
on
the
basis
of
sex,
excluded
from
participation
in,
denied
benefits
of,
or
subjected
to
discrimination
under
an
education
program?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that...
that
remotely
describes
what
happened
to
this
coach?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it's
separate
enough
from
discrimination
that
in
other
statutes,
although
congress
does
create
a
cause
of
action
for
discrimination,
it
goes
out
of
its
way
to
create
a
separate
cause
of
action
for
retaliation.
it's
sufficiently
separate,
and
if
it
is
that
sufficiently
separate,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
could
clearly
say
that...
that
when
the
state
signed
on
to
receiving
federal
funds
under
title
ix,
they
should
have
known
that
this
door
to
litigation
was
being
opened
to
them.
yes,
litigation
for...
for
discrimination
against...
against
female
athletes,
but
not...
not
discrimination
suits
alleging
retaliation.
that's
a
whole,
new
area.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
could
be
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
sanction
is
so
draconian
that
nobody
in
his
right
mind
is
not
going
to
rehire
the
coach.
of
course,
they're
going
to
rehire.
i...
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
why
a
draconian
sanction
is
ineffective.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it's...
it's
overwhelmingly
effective.
you
tell
the
school
you
either
rehire
the
coach
or
we're
cutting
off
your
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
hard
to
decide
what
they're
going
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
rules
out
this
one,
but
it
doesn't
rule
out
the
main...
look
it,
this
is
a
weird
kind
of
retaliation
claim.
usually
the
retaliation
claim
is
the
person
who
has
been
discriminated
against
complains
about
the
discrimination,
and
for
that
complaint,
the
person
who
was
discriminated
against
is
demoted
or
not
promoted,
or
whatever.
that's...
that's
the
classic
retaliation
claim.
and
that
classic
claim
is
surely
covered
by...
on
the
basis
of
that
person's
sex.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
date
of
the
sullivan
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
'69.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
you
think
that
we
take
the
same
approach
to
implied
causes
of
action
today
that
we
took
in
1969?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
case
it
is,
but
one
of
our
cases,
the
argument
was
precisely
made
that
the
statute
before
us
had
been
enacted
by
congress
before
we
had
set
our
face
against
implied
causes
of
action,
and
therefore,
we
should
interpret
that
statute
the
way
we
used
to
in
1969,
and
we
rejected
that
argument.
we
said
that
our
new
rule,
as
to
when
you
find
implied
causes
of
action,
will
be
applied
to
all
statutes,
whether
they
were
enacted
by
a
congress
that...
that
thought
we
would
go
skipping
along
forever
as
we
did
in
1969
or...
or
not.
and...
and
that's
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
because
congress
in...
in
the...
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted
believed
in
the
existence
of
a
supreme
court
that
would
readily
find
implied
causes
of
action,
we...
we
have
to
do
that
for
all
these
old
statutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
where
you
hang.
you...
you
really
think
congress,
when
it
enacted
title
ix,
paid
close
attention
and
said...
instead
of
saying
no
person
in
the
united
states
shall
on
the
basis
of
that
person's
sex
be
excluded
from
participation,
you
think
somebody
had...
had
suggested
that
language,
and
they
said,
oh,
no,
no,
no,
that
would
make
it
too
narrow.
we
have
to
take
out
that
person's.
i...
i
don't...
it
doesn't
strike
me
as
a...
as
an
obvious
import
of
not
including
the
word
that
person's
sex.
it's
a
very
natural
way
to
write
it:
no
person
in
the
united
states
shall
on
the
basis
of
sex.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
punitive
damages
available
under
title
ix?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
regulations
didn't
say
anything
about
a
private
cause
of
action,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
statute
didn't
say
anything
about
a
private
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
a
civil
rights
statute
that
provides
for
a
private
cause
of
action?
i...
i
want
to
know
what
the
hypothetical
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
were
some
later
cases
that
cast
a
good
deal
of
doubt
on
whether
we
would
apply
cannon
anymore.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
that?
i
mean,
do
we
have
any
idea
how
effective
the
enforcement
of
ocr
is?
just
because
they
haven't
cut
off
funds--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
may
well
not
have
cut
off
funds
because
anybody
who
gets
a
directive
from
them
will
hop
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
do
they
call
more
than
infrequently?
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
don't
concede
the
point
that
it
is
the
role
of
this
court
to
determine
whether
agencies
are
inefficient
or
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
if
they
are
inefficient
to...
to
raise
up
private
attorneys
general
to...
to
fill
the
void?
justice
antonin
scalia
other
statutes
do
it
separately.
justice
antonin
scalia
other
statutes
don't
view
the
one
as...
as
being
incorporated
in
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
no
vagaries
in
private
enforcement.
private
attorneys
general
always
act
in
the
interest
of
the
whole
polity.
there
are
no
vagaries
there.
