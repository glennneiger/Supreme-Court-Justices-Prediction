we'll
hear
argument
in
jackson
against
the
birmingham
board
of
education.
mr.
dellinger.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
thomas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
you
say
it's
not
there,
but
the
agencies
interpreting
the
statute
thought
it
was
there.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
their
reading
of
the
statute
was
that
the
word
discrimination
included
a
retaliation
claim.
that's
the
kind
of
regulations
they
drafted
on
the
basis
of
their
understanding
of
what
congress
intended
by
using
the
word...
the
words
in
this
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
cannot
use
the
regulation
that
goes
beyond
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
that's
what
that
holds.
but
a
regulation
interpreting
what
the
statute
itself
provides
is
in
a
different
ball
park.
and
that's
what
i
understand
these
regulations
to
have
done,
to
say
what
the
agencies
thought
the
statute
itself
meant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
had
never
anticipated
a
private
right
of
action,
even
though
it
read
the
cannon
opinion,
which
was
written
some
20
years
ago?
maybe
more
than
that.
i
don't
remember.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
congress
itself
has
adopted
the
rule
set
forth
in
cannon.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
thomas.
mr.
newsom.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
did
construe
the
word
discrimination,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
newsom.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dellinger,
you
have
about
3
and
a
half
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
dellinger.
the
case
is
submitted.
