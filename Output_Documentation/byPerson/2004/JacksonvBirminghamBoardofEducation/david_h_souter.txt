justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
we
don't
accept...
let's
assume,
just
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that...
that
we're
having
trouble
accepting
the...
the
analysis
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
statute
in
the
statute's
own
terms.
you
then
made
the
argument
that,
in
fact,
you
should
recognize
retaliation
as
a
claim
because
in
the
context
of...
of
school
students
and
so
on,
if
you
don't
allow
retaliation,
the
teachers
are
not
going
to
blow
the
whistle,
and
if
the
teachers
blow
the
whistle,
the
statute
is
going
to
be
a
dead
letter.
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
the...
the
argument
is
you...
you
should
recognize
this
as
a
necessity.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
still
goes
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
why
do
we
have
to
recognize
a
private
cause
of
action
as
opposed
to
the
government
allowing
an
administrative
remedy?
and
i
thought
you
were
leading
up
to
saying
the
administrative
remedy
simply
isn't
effective
because
it's
so
draconian
that,
in
fact,
they
don't
impose
it,
or
for
some
other
reason.
so
my
question
is,
is
there
an
argument
to
say
that
the
administrative
remedy
simply
is
not
good
enough
to
preclude...
to...
to
deter
retaliation
and
that's
why
you've
got
to
have
a
private
cause
of
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's...
what
are
the
facts?
what's
the
empirical
evidence
for
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what...
what
do
you
make
of
the...
the
point
that
mr.
dellinger
stressed
and
others
have
stressed
that,
in
fact,
there
is
no
administrative
remedy
in
the
real
world?
it's...
it's...
there...
there
have
never...
there
has
never
been
an
instance
in
which
funds
have
been
withheld.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the...
the
argument
that's
being
raised
is
whether
we're
talking
about
the
person
who
is
listed
in
the
statute
as
the
primary
beneficiary
of
the
anti-discrimination
statute
or
whether
we're
talking
about
the
teacher
who
blows
the
whistle
and
so
on...
the...
the
argument
is
unless
you
allow
this
teacher
or
this
whistle
blower
to...
to
bring
the
private
action,
your
statute
is
a
dead
letter,
that
the...
that
if...
if...
once
you
recognize
a
private
action,
you've
either
got
to
recognize
this
kind
of
private
action
or
you
can
forget
the
whole
thing.
that's
the
argument,
and...
and
so
simply
to
say,
well,
they're
not
within
the...
the
primary
ambit
of
benefit
of
the
statute
is...
is
not
to
the
point
of
the
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we...
do
we
have
any...
any
empirical
evidence
as
to...
as
to
what
they
have
thus
leveraged?
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
other
side
says,
look,
dead
letter.
what
do
we
know
about
such
life
as
there
may
be
in
the
letter?
