administrative

mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there
has
been
one
case
in
which
an
administrative
sanction
was
imposed
under
title
vi,
justice
kennedy.
it...
the
agency
does
have
some
flexibility
to
attempt
to
get
voluntary
resolutions
that
are
short
of
the
sanction,
the
final
sanction,
but--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--we
do,
justice...
justice
o'connor.
i'm
sorry.
retaliation
against
a
person
because
that
person
has
complained
about
sex
discrimination
under
title
ix
is
itself
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
title
ix.
and
that
conclusion
flows
from
four
considerations,
beginning
with
the
court's
decision
critically
in
sullivan
because
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
a
person
subjected
to
retaliation
because
he
complained
about
racial
discrimination
against
his
lessee
could
sue
under
section
1982's
prohibition,
which
only
prohibits
racial
discrimination.
against
the
backdrop
of
that
decision
in
sullivan,
congress
would
have
understood
its
prohibition
against
sex
discrimination
to
afford
comparable
protection
against
retaliation.
so
a
person
who
is
subjected--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
is,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
explanation
for
that
for...
in
title
vii,
for
example,
is
that
the
core
prohibitions
in
title
vii
refer
to
discrimination
based
on
such
individual's
race,
sex,
or
national
origin,
and
that
such
individual's
language
rules
out
the
kind
of
retaliation
claim
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
if...
if
it's
based
on
the
fact
that
the...
that
the
person
is
complaining
about
sex
discrimination
and
not
on
the
sex
of
the
complainer,
it's
exactly
the
same
theory
of
discrimination
that
we
have
here,
justice
scalia.
and
that
theory
of
discrimination
was
recognized
in
the
sullivan
decision.
discrimination
occurs
when
there
is
retaliation
against
a
person
because
he's
complaining
about
racial
discrimination.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
was
3
years
before
congress
enacted
section...
i
think
it
was
'68...
'69.
i'm
sorry.
'69.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
was
'69,
justice
scalia.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
you
do
not,
justice
scalia,
when
you
are
starting
afresh,
but--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
true,
justice
kennedy.
but
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question,
first,
you
operate
in
the
legal
context
in
which
congress
was
operating
at
the
time,
and
congress
would
have
understood...
and
this
court
has
twice
relied
on
the
sullivan
decision
in
interpreting
title
ix,
once
in
deciding
that
there
was
a
private
right
of
action
and
once
in
deciding
that
the
private
right
of
action
included
a
claim
for
damages.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--let...
let
me
talk
about
the
cases
that
i
think
the
principle
that
you're
talking
about
emerges
from.
one
is
the
central
bank
case,
and
what
you
were
asked
to
do
there
was
to
add
the
words,
aiders
and
abetters,
to
the
statute.
we're
not
asking
you
to
add
words
to
this
statute.
we're
asking
you
to
interpret
the
words
that
are
there--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--in
light
of
the
relevant
context.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
about
virginia
bankshares,
but
i
don't
think
it...
it
states
a
principle.
the
other
case
that
i
was
thinking
about,
justice
kennedy,
is
the...
is
the
sandoval
case.
and
again,
there
somebody
was
asking
you
to
afford
a
private
right
of
action
for
something
that
the
statute
did
not
itself
prohibit.
and
what
we
are
saying
here
is,
interpret
this
statute
in
light
of
the
legal
context
that
congress
had
it,
which
is--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct.
but
this
statute
does
not
require
discrimination
because
of
such
individual's
sex.
it
require--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it's...
it's
written
exactly
not
like
title
vii,
justice
o'connor,
and
it's
written
far
more
like
section
1982,
which
was
at
issue
at
sullivan,
which
doesn't
have
a
such
individual's
limitation.
and
in...
and
section
1982
was
interpreted
to
mean
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
in
depriving
people
of
interests
of
property
violates
that
statute
and
affords
a
private
right
of
action
of
the
victim
of
retaliation.
and
so
too
here.
and
a
person
who
is
victimized
by
retaliation
because
that
person
has
been
subjected
before...
because
he
complained
about
sex
discrimination
is
a
victim
of
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
this
is...
it
opens
it
up
to
this
interpretation,
and
then
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
relevant
considerations.
inserting
the
words,
such
individual's,
would
foreclose
that
kind
of
retaliation
claim,
and
it's
not
here.
and
so
it's...
then
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
other
relevant
considerations,
including
sullivan,
including
the
fact
that
this
is
of
vital
importance
to
promoting
the
purposes
of
the
act,
including
the
fact
that
the
agencies
responsible
for
enforcing
this
provision
have
both
interpreted...
the
key
agencies
have
interpreted
it
to
encompass
protection
against
retaliation,
and
including
the
fact
that
there's
absolutely
no
legitimate
interest
that
a...
a
recipient
has
in
retaliating
against
somebody
simply
because
he's
filed
a
title
ix
sex
discrimination
complaint.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
in...
it...
we...
we
have
taken
the
position
that
there
is,
based
on
a
textual
argument
within
the
federal
sector
provision,
a
basis
for
finding
a
retaliation
prohibition
over
and
above
the
use
of
discrimination.
we
have
not
taken
that
position
with
respect
to
the...
to
some
other
statutes.
so
we
do
think
this
is
a
statute-by-statute
analysis
and
that
you
just
can't
adopt
an
automatic
principle
that
because
there's
an
anti-discrimination
provision,
it
automatically
always
picks
up
retaliation
protection.
you
have
to
look
at
it
on
a
statute-by-statute
basis.
and
here,
though,
all
the
relevant
considerations,
including
sullivan,
including
the
need
for
this
kind
of
protection
to
further
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
including
the
agencies'
interpretation
of
this
statute
which,
by
the
way,
does
provide
fair
notice
that
this
was
prohibited,
included
in...
i
think
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
the
spending
clause.
what
the
spending
clause
does
not
require
is
that
it
specifically
refer
to
retaliation
any
more
than
it
required
that
it
specifically
refer
to
peer-on-peer
harassment.
what
it
does
require,
though,
is
fair
notice,
and
that
fair
notice
is
supplied
by
the
sullivan
decision,
this
court's
cases
saying
that
sullivan
is
an
important
backdrop
principle
against
which
title
ix
was
enacted,
and
finally
the
regulations
themselves,
which
specifically
forbid
retaliation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i'm
sorry.
punitive
damages
would
not
be
available
against
a
municipality
or
against
a...
but
it
could
be
available
against
some
other
private
recipients.
