do
they
have
any
other
sanction?
because
the
notion
of
an
administrative
remedy
ordinarily
would
be
a
remedy
for
the
individual
who's
complaining.
but
as
i
understand
it,
this
administrative
process,
this
detailed
administrative
process,
leads
only
to
one
sanction,
the
one
you
have
described
as
draconian.
justice

bader

have
funds--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--have
funds...
mr.
dellinger,
have
funds
ever
been
withdrawn
from
any
school
because
of
a
violation
of--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--title
ix?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
can't
imagine
anyone
who
would
want
such
a
sanction.
it
doesn't
help--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
girls
on
the
team.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gornstein,
what
implication
would
there
be,
if
we
took
the
view
of
the
circuit
here,
for
federal
employment?
title
vii
does
have
a
discrete
retaliation
provision,
but
it
doesn't
with
respect
to
federal
employees,
if
i
understand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
often
has
ocr
come
to
the
school
district
in
question
under
title
ix?
there
are
many
statutes
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ocr
administers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
he
differ...
how
does
he
differ
from
the
renter
in
sullivan
who
was
complaining
about
the
refusal
to
sell
or
lease
property
to
african
americans?
he
wanted
to
lease
his
property,
and
as
a
result,
he
was
thrown
out
of
the
club.
and
this
court
said
he
could
maintain
that
suit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
with
respect
to
that,
is
ocr
so
different
from
other
agencies
that
have
to
pick
and
choose
because
they
simply
don't
have
the
resources
to
enforce?
now,
how
often
does
ocr,
in
fact,
go
in
and
investigate?
how
many
times
do
they
say,
well,
it's
low
priority
for
us,
girls'
soccer
or
girls'
basketball,
and
we
have
bigger
fish
to
fry?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
is
of
the
universe
of
complaints
that
are
made
under
title
ix,
how
many
does
ocr
actually
follow
up,
or
isn't
it
strapped
for
resources
so
that
it
can't,
however
much
it
may
want
to,
come
in
the
way
you
described?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
the
very
reason
for
recognizing
a
private
right
of
action
because
the...
the
requirement,
the
anti-discrimination
requirement,
would
be
a
dead
letter
if
you
didn't
have
people
who
could
enforce
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's...
to
say
trust
me
is...
is
not
an
answer.
cannon
is
one
thing,
a
woman
in
her
30's.
a
sixth-grader
who
is
told
she
can't
play
on
a
team
because
there's
none
for
girls
is
hardly
similarly
situated
and
the
law
won't
be
enforced
as
to
her
unless
you
have
someone
who
is
best
positioned
to
know
what
is
going
on,
who
is
the
coach.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
point
is
if
you
say
to
the
school,
you
cannot
retaliate
against
someone
because
a
complaint
has
been
made,
that's
a
powerful
incentive
for
the
school
not
to
retaliate
against
someone
and
to
do
something
about
the
discrimination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wasn't
it
in
the
regulations
of
the
agency
spelled
out
rather
clearly...
the...
the
agency
that
says,
congress
has
told
us
to
implement
this
statute,
here
are
our
regulations
and
our
regulations
are
you
don't
retaliate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
said
in
this
statute
we
do,
having
in
mind
that
title
vi
would
be
interpreted
in
the
identical
way--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--title
vii...
vi
proscribing
race
discrimination
in
all
federal
programs.
so
it
said
these
statutes
aimed
at
race
discrimination,
sex
discrimination
do
have
a...
a
private
right
of
action,
and
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you're
talking
about
the
sixth
grade
soccer
team,
realistically
the
only
one
who
is
going
to
know
anything...
enough
and
be
brave
enough
to
complain
will
be
the
teacher.
and
if
you
cut
the
teacher
out,
then
forget
it.
you
have
nice
words
on
paper
and
they'll
never
be
enforced.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
ocr
says,
as
it
usually
does,
we're
too
busy.
sorry.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
congress
didn't
give
us
enough
money
to
do
the
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
your
personal
testimony.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is...
there
is
much
testimony
on
the
other
side
that
says
we
call
and
call
and
they
don't
come.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
title
ix
complaints
in
your...
in
your
experience?
you
mentioned
one.
is
there
any
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
two?
in
how
many
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
two
in
20-something
years.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
like
the
choice
it
made
in
1982,
very
spare
statute.
when
congress
got
to
title
ix,
it
knew
about
sullivan
and
so
it...
this...
this
statute
in
its
breadth
and
its
simplicity
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
old
pattern
in
1981
and
1982
and
1983.
so
if
you
say
to
me,
look
at
the
closest
model,
it
would
be
that
and
not
the
more
detailed
civil
rights
legislation
that
came
in
'64
and
'65.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
says
if
you're
thrown
out
of
the
club
because
you
champion
the
rights
of
a
black
man,
you
have
a
right
to
sue
under
this
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
account
of
race
is
in
it.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
to
me
they
would
get
it
when
congress
says,
and
here's
the
statute,
very
spare,
and
agency,
you
get
up
guidelines,
that
any
responsible
school
board
would
say,
well,
we've
got
only
one
sentence
in
the
statute.
we
better
look
at
the
regulations
to
find
out
what's
required.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's...
we're
not
talking
about
the
procedure,
i
mean,
what
procedural
moves.
what
must
you
do
to
comply?
and
it
has
in
there
you
don't
retaliate.
so
you
mean
that
a
board
could
responsibly
take
the
position,
well,
the...
the
regulations
tell
us
we
don't
retaliate,
but
when
we're
not
faced
with
any
agency
breathing
down
our
neck,
all
we
have
is
a
teacher
in
front
of
us,
then
we
can
retaliate?
i
mean,
they
must
have
known
the
statute
meant
don't
retaliate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i...
i
really
don't
get
that.
if
the
rule
is
don't
retaliate
and
if
we
investigate,
that's
one
of
the
things
we're
going...
that's
going
to
be
on
our
checklist.
but
the
substantive
rule
is
don't
retaliate.
