mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
justice
stevens,
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
o'connor,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
question
that
you
raised
immediately.
i
can't
think
of
any
school
board
lawyer
who
is
called
by
his
superintendent
and
told
that
i
had
a
letter
from
ocr
and
they
want
to
know
why
you
aren't
doing
this
and
that
who
would
not
be
in
that
superintendent's
office
that
moment
because
when
ocr
comes
in,
they
canvas
everything.
i
mean,
and
as
a
part
of
negotiating
and
their
investigative
teams,
they're
lay
people.
they're
not
lawyers.
they
come
in
demanding,
and
what
they
prepare
for
compliance,
i
can't
even
begin
to
articulate
how
overreaching
it
is.
and
so
i
say
i
wanted
you
to--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--and
i
would
want
to
suggest--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--in
1996,
we
had
a
conclusion
of
an
ocr
title
ix
investigation
because
it
dealt
with
boys'
football
as
it
related
to
related
sports
offered
for
girls.
so
we...
we
know
about
ocr,
and
they're
in
atlanta.
they
are
about
167
miles
away
and
when...
and
when
they
come,
they
come,
your
honors.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
get
right
now
to
what
i
had
raised
as
the
issue
here,
and
that's
whether
or
not
an
implied
private
right
of
action
under
title
ix
for
retaliation
for
petitioner
who
himself
says
that
he's
not
a
victim
of
discrimination,
but
merely
an
advocate.
he's
an
advocate
of
gender
equity,
and
we
say
no.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
justice
ginsburg,
i
offer
this
one
observation.
under
1982,
there
is
not
a
corollary
administrative
remedy.
so
in
the
sullivan
situation,
the
only
advocate
available
at
that
time
was
the
owner
of
the
home.
and...
but
i
would
comment
that
as
he
continued
in
his
litigation,
he
continued
to
advocate.
under
title
ix,
as
we
have
discussed,
for
the
advocate
is
the
phone
call,
the
toll-free
call
to
ocr
and
express
your
concerns
and
your
issues
about
what's
happening.
and
we
find
significance
in
that
because
the
ultimate
benefit
is
for
the
designated
class,
which
would
be
the
basketball
team.
in
a
private
lawsuit
filed
by
mr.
jackson,
the
damage
award
goes
directly
to
him.
if
he's
successful
in
getting
injunctive
relief,
it
goes
only
to
him.
in
other
words,
school
board,
you
can't
retaliate
or
you're
enjoined
from
retaliating
against
him
in
the
future,
but
nothing
from
that
federal
court
would
go
to
benefit
the
girls'
basketball
team.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
well,
again,
justice
souter,
no,
the
funds
have
not
been
terminated.
but
i
can
only
share
with
you
my
experiences
with
dealing
with
these
people.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
justice
ginsburg,
the
only
thing
that
i
can
say
is
that
on
my
watch,
the
number
one
priority
is
to
keep
ocr
out.
so...
so
therefore--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--well,
your
honor,
that
was
something
that
was
recognized
in
cannon.
i...
i
think
that
was
cited
in
several
of
the
footnotes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
but...
but
again,
stay
mindful.
geraldine
cannon,
though,
she
said,
i
did
not
get
admission
to
the...
the
med
school
because
of
my
sex,
and
she
is
clearly
within
the
proviso
of
no
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
so--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--justice
souter,
let
me
offer
this
in
two
ways.
one,
it's
not
realistic.
in...
in
other
words,
when...
when
you
have
a
scenario
about
the
private
cause
of
action,
teachers
aren't...
i
mean,
these
parents
and...
and
the...
and
especially
in
birmingham,
we
have
an
athletic
director
at
the
school.
we
have
a
director
of
athletics
for
the
whole
school
system.
and
so
that...
that's
not
realistic,
i
mean,
because
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
administration
is
very
conscientious
about
all
of
its
programs.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
but,
justice
ginsburg,
we
get
back
to
the
point
who
really
benefits
because...
and
especially
in
this
scenario,
if
the
advocate
sues
and
receives
the
monetary
damages,
that
goes
to
the
advocate.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
well,
but
again,
though,
justice
ginsburg,
the
other
side
of
that
would
be
when
under
the
spending
legislation,
the
school
board
had
a
right
to
know
what
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
financial
assistance
would
be,
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
there
was
nowhere
on
the
landscape
that--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--but
that's
a
part
of
the
complaint
and
investigatory
process.
now,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--no,
it
did
not.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
it's
not
on
the
face.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
no,
it
does
not,
justice
o'connor.
and...
and
again,
it's
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
obviously,
once
it
was--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
it...
it
does
say
that
he
was
relieved.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
yes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
justice
breyer,
in
that
context--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--i...
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
but
again--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
justice
breyer,
don't
we
have
to
consider
at
some
point
in
time
what
the
congressional
intent
was?
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
and
again...
and
i
submit
to
you--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--and
i
would
want
to
submit
to
you
interveningly
you
have
had
the
passing
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
so
everybody
now
has
access
to
congress.
the
whole
spectrum
of
american
society
is
in
congress.
so
if
congress
is
being
well
represented,
when
it
passes
the
law
in
1972,
as
it
did
here,
it
had
a
different
perspective
on
it.
going
back
to
1969,
some
things
were
foreclosed
to
some
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states.
so,
obviously,
the
scenario
of
someone
advocating,
like
in
sullivan,
would
make
sense.
but
i
submit
to
you
respectfully,
that's
not
the
case
now.
over
there
in
congress
is
where
this
debate
needs
to
be,
and
on
the
face
of
this
statute,
it's
not
there.
retaliation
is
not
there.
if
i
may,
though,
justice
breyer,
let
me
also
add
as
a
practical
consideration--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--but...
but
that's
an...
an
investigatory...
the
administrative
enforcement
scenario.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
but
don't
we
go...
justice
stevens,
don't
we
go
back
to
sandoval?
can
you
in
a
regulation
do
more
than
what
the
statute
requires?
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
but...
but
again,
that's
retaliation
after
someone
has
filed
a
complaint
with
the
appropriate
office.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
well,
justice
breyer,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
i
just
can't
get
there.
i
apologize
for
that,
respectfully,
but...
but
i
can't.
and
justice
o'connor,
as
a
follow-up,
interestingly
enough,
in
a
case
on
all
fours
in
1995,
holt
v.
lewis,
the
united
states
district
dourt
for
the
northern
district
of
birmingham...
for
the
northern
district
of
alabama
made
very
clear
that
an
implied
private
right
of
action
was
not
cognizable
under
title
ix,
and
that
the
regulation
was
not
a
basis
to
follow
it.
and...
and
i
submit
to
you
on
that
basis,
that
in
birmingham,
at
the
very
least,
because
the
case
was
affirmed
by
the
eleventh
circuit
and
this
court
denied
cert
in
1997,
so
anyone
who
would
go--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--no,
no,
i
don't,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
but...
but
to
say...
i
was
trying
to
emphasize
was
the
notice
and
the
mind
set
of
the
board
when
it
accepted
these
federal
funds.
it
had
no
way
of
anticipating
that
retaliation--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--justice
cannon,
your
opinion
there
is
going
to
be
around
for
a
long
time.
the
scholars
are
going
to
have
to
debate
it
for
years.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
but...
but
if
i
may,
but
then
justice
rehnquist
cautioned
very
clearly
that
the
court...
in
his
concurring
opinion,
that
the
court
in
the
future
should
be
extremely
reluctant
to
imply
a
cause
of
action
absent
such
specificity
on
the
part
of
the
legislative
branch.
and
that
just
speaks
volumes
to
me.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
yes,
ma'am.
well,
but...
but
again,
it
goes...
goes
back
to...
but
would
that
include
retaliation?
and...
and--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--but,
justice
ginsburg,
that
teacher
could
easily,
if
they
don't
get
a
positive
response
from
the
administration,
they
can
call
ocr.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
no.
they...
no--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--i...
i--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--justice
scalia,
that's
exactly
it.
i
mean,
i
have
firsthand
knowledge
that
when
they
call,
we're
supposed
to
jump.
it's
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
all
the
time.
and...
and
the
other
side
of
that
coin--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--yes,
ma'am.
yes,
it
is.
[laughter]
and...
and
justice--
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
--well,
i've
been
in
educational
law
now
almost
27
years,
representing
both
teachers
and
school
boards.
so
i
have
firsthand
knowledge.
i
mean...
and
i've
experienced
it
both
at
the
secondary
level
and
higher
ed.
i
mean,
when
they
come
in,
they
come
in.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
two.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
in
26.
mr.
kenneth
l.
thomas
yes,
ma'am.
but
they're
all
memorable.
[laughter]
they're
all...
thank
you.
