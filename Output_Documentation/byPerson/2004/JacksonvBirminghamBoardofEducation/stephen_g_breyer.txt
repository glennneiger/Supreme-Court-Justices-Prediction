justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
legal
question,
nothing
to
do
with,
you
know,
practicalities?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
you
go
back
to
the
very
old,
bad
days
of
the
1950's
in
the
south,
the
'60's.
they
pass
some
civil
rights
legislation.
a
lot
of
legislation
was
passed
in
the
'60's.
now,
under
that
civil
rights
legislation,
imagine
an
individual
had
been
kept
out
of
a
restaurant
or
he'd
been
treated
physically
badly,
not
because
of
his
race.
he
was
white,
but
he
was
associating
with
people
who
were
black.
and
they
both
go
into
the
restaurant
and
they
both
are
refused
service.
maybe
they're
beaten
up.
i
mean,
both
of
them.
now,
can
the
white
individual
bring
a
lawsuit
under
the...
the
civil
rights
statute?
i've
always
thought
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
of
course,
he
can.
would
you...
do
you
think
it's
the
contrary
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
of
course.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
therefore--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'd...
i'd
like
to...
i'm
thinking
of
various
civil
rights
statutes
which
make
it
unlawful
to
describe...
to...
to
discriminate.
and
now,
i
agree
with
you
on
that
answer.
the
white
person
could
bring
a
lawsuit
on
the
basis
of
someone
else's
race
because
he's
being
discriminated
against
not
because
of
his
own
race,
but
because
he's
being...
he's
associated
with
people
who
are
being
discriminated
against.
i
agree
with
your
answer.
and
so
my
question
is
if
that's
so
and
if
we
have
a
long
history
here
of
the
words,
on
the
basis
of
sex,
including
retaliation
not
on
the
basis
of
my
sex,
but
retaliation
on
the
basis
of
someone
else's
sex...
that's
what
i've
complained
of...
why
isn't
this
the
same
thing
and
to
get
out
my
whole
question...
there
are
two
parts...
why
isn't
this
the
same
thing?
and
the
second
part
is,
because
i
think
it
is
the
same
thing...
the
second
part
is
once
it
is
included
in
1981...
in...
is
it
1681(a)?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
once
we
include
this
in
1681(a),
that's
the
end
of
this
case
because
sandoval
then
supports
the
other
side.
it
doesn't
support
you.
all
right.
that's
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you...
you
go
ahead.
i'm
doing
it
purely
as
a
matter
of
logic.
i'm
saying
the
old
civil
rights
cases
make
clear
it
doesn't
have
to
be
on
the
basis
of
your
own
race.
history
makes
clear
that
retaliation
on
the
basis
of
someone
else's
race
does
fit
within...
or
gender
does
fit
within
1681,
and
then
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
so
i
would
like
your
response
to
that
logic.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well...
i
mean,
sandoval
is
very
clear.
it's
a
very
clear
opinion
in
my
view.
very
clear.
and
the
key
language
i
thought
is,
the
language
statutes
that
focus
on
the
person
regulated
rather
than
individuals
protected
create
no
implication
of
an
intent
to
confer
the
private
right.
so
they're
looking
at
disparate
impact
and
disparate
impact,
according
to
the
majority...
i
was
in
the
dissent...
did
not
intend
to
protect
the
person
discriminated
against,
but
was
a
way
of
regulating
people
so
they
wouldn't
intentionally
discriminate.
i
can
understand
that.
but
i
apply
the
same...
i
didn't
agree
with
it,
but
i
can
understand
it.
the...
the...
i
apply
the
same
reasoning
here.
the
reasoning
here
is
that
this
retaliation
thing
is
not
trying
to
protect
university
behavior
one
whit
more
than
the
whole
underlying
thing
is
trying
to
protect
university
behavior.
this
is
about
victims.
retaliation
and
being
fired
is
about
victims.
and
so
given
sandoval,
then
we
have
the
history,
we
have
the
language,
and
we
have
that
sentence
from
sandoval.
and
all
that
suggests...
it
goes
into
1681(a),
in
which
case
sandoval
says,
a
private
right
of
action,
given
cannon,
would
be
inferred.
now,
what's...
what's...
that's
how...
i'm
tracing
out
the
logic
of
the
thing.
so
i
want
to
see
what
you
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
they're
not
relevant,
do
you
think
that
the
regulation
which
provides...
do
you
think
it's
unlawful?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
if
you
don't
contest
the
validity
of
it
and
you
think
it's
lawful,
do
you
think
it's
doing
something
other
than
interpreting
1681(a)?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is
it
doing?
