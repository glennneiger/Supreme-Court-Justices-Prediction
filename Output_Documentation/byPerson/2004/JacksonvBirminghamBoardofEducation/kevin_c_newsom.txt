mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address,
if
i
may,
several
concerns
that
have
been
raised
during
the...
the
preceding
arguments.
one
is
to
clarify
some
things
about
the
scope
of
the
administrative
remedy.
the
other
side,
with
respect,
wants
you
to
think
that
without
the
implied
right
of
action
for
damages
and
fees,
whistle
blowers
are
left
out
in
the
cold.
that
is
not
true.
the
administrative
remedy...
it's
not
just
about
funding
termination.
34
c.f.r.
106.3
says
that
the
ocr
may
use
any
remedy
that
it
deems
necessary.
the
ocr,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
has
itself
touted
its
flexible
approach
to
enforcement
which
includes,
among
other
things,
as
this
court
noted
in
gebser,
citing
back
to
its
earlier...
pardon
me...
decision
in
north
haven,
individualized
relief
in
appropriate
circumstances.
so
the
point,
as
senator
bayh
himself
noted
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
is
that
it
is
the
threat
of...
of
funding
termination.
so
while
the
ocr
is
wielding
the
club
of
funding
termination,
they
can
extract
or
leverage
individualized
relief
in
appropriate
cases.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
none
that
i
am
aware
of,
your...
your
honor,
but--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well...
well,
i
will,
i
assume,
perhaps
foolishly,
defer
to
the
solicitor
general's
office
to
tell
you
what...
what
the
doj
has
and
hasn't
done.
what
i
can
tell
you
is
that...
that
the
doj
manual
that
the
other
side
cites
throughout
its
briefs
expressly
encourages
agencies,
when
enforcing
these...
these
things,
to
leverage
even
damage
awards
on
behalf
of
individual
claimants.
so
i
can
tell
you
that,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
this
is
far
from
a
dead
letter.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
of
course
not.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
of
course
not,
justice
scalia,
and...
and
the
court
knows
very
well
from
my
brief
that
our
position
is
that
when
you're
talking
about
implied
rights
of
action,
this
court
has
made
clear,
in
the
cases
leading
up
to
sandoval,
culminating
in
sandoval,
that
these
sorts
of
policy
considerations
really
are
not
relevant.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
we
do
not
contest
the
validity
of
the
regulation.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
it...
section
100.7(e),
the
regulation
upon
which
jackson
chiefly
relies,
we
readily
concede
is
a
valid,
effectuating
902
regulation,
but
all...
all
it
does
by
its
text...
and
its
structure
makes
clear
all
it
does...
is
to
govern
the
internal
processes
of
official
ocr
investigations.
it
does
not
go
further
than
that.
this
court
in
sandoval
was
very
clear
that
it
was...
that
it
was
only
authoritative
interpretations
of
a
statute's
terms
that
can
be
enforced
pursuant
to
that
statute's
implied
right
of
action.
another
point
i
want
to
make
about
the
administrative
remedy.
justice
ginsburg
asked
whether
funds
had
ever
been
withdrawn,
and
even
there,
again,
if
the
answer
is
no,
the
point
is
not
whether
funds
have
been
withdrawn,
but
that
as
senator
bayh
himself
noted,
that
the
threat
of
funds
is
where
the
heavy
lifting
is
done
in
administrative
enforcement.
another
point
about
administrative
enforcement
is
whether
or
not
there
are
sufficient
resources.
that,
obviously,
was
a
valid
concern
in
cannon,
given
presumably
the
inordinate
number
of
complaints
about
core,
traditional
discrimination.
but
as
the
other
side
has
made
clear
in
its
briefing
in
this
case,
at
page
26
of
the
petitioner's
brief...
and
then
there's
a
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
southern
poverty
law
center
that
spins
this
out
in
some
detail...
there
just
aren't
many
of
these
retaliation
claims
out
there,
either
in
the...
either...
either
in
the
judicial
system
or
at
ocr.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
my...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
i
think
in
all
likelihood,
it
is
the
latter.
certainly
i
would
think
that
the
court
would
presume...
would
not
presume
ill
of
local
school
districts
and...
and
even
state
universities,
but
would
presume
that
they
are
complying
with,
if
not
clearly
articulated
law,
certainly
good
public
policy.
the
second
point
is
that
what
the...
the
absence
of
private
actions
for
retaliation
shows
is
that
title
ix's
remedial
apparatus
is
kicking
along
just
fine
without
the
implied
right
of
action.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
certainly,
your
honor--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--you
have
to
take
as
true,
of
course,
the
facts
as
pledged
in
the...
as
pleaded
in
the
complaint.
another
point
i'd
like
to
make
briefly
is
about
the
comparison
to
title
vii.
the
other
side
wants
you
to
look
very
closely
at
title
vii
when
you're...
whether
it's
on
the
basis
of
sex
or
on
the
basis
of
such
individual's
sex,
but
they
want
you
to
ignore
title
vii
and
the
fact
that
it
very
clearly
and
expressly
deals
with
retaliation
in
a
separate
subsection,
a
separate
provision.
and
i
didn't...
i'll
have
to
confess
i
didn't
hear
much
during
the
first
argument.
i
had
my
head
in
my
own
book,
but
what
i
did
hear
is
justice
souter
referring
to
the...
the...
an
instance
in
which
congress
has
a
choice
of
two
models
for...
for
constructing
a
statute,
and
it
chooses
one
over
the
other,
and
isn't
it
a
reasonable
inference
to
allow
congress
to
make
that
choice.
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
if...
if
i
could
answer
in
two
parts.
first,
to
say
that
i
think
what
was
going
on
in
1964
in
the
civil
rights
act,
obviously,
you
have
congress
in
title
vii
addressing
itself
both
to
discrimination
and
to
retaliation
separately;
in
title
vi,
passed
as
part
of
the
same
piece
of
legislation,
addressing
itself
solely
to
discrimination.
and
to
use
justice
souter's
analogy,
in
'72
congress
takes
the
title
vi
model
and
not
the
title
vii
model.
now,
to
get
to
your
question
specifically,
i
think,
about
sullivan
is
at
the
heart
of
your
question,
sullivan...
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
problems
with
the
other
side's
reliance
on
sullivan.
first,
with
all
due
respect
to
this
court,
sullivan
itself
is
pretty
opaque.
it
certainly
does
not
announce
with
flashing
lights
a
principle
that
every
anti-discrimination
provision
necessarily
entails
a
subsidiary
or
corollary--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--even
if
i
were
to
grant
your
assumption
of
clarity
in
sullivan,
which
justice
harlan,
i
presume,
would
not
agree
with...
he
was
left
sort
of
scratching
his
head
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
court
was
trying
to
do.
but
even
granting
your
assumption,
if
1982
can
be
construed
that
way,
that...
that
construction
does
not
necessarily
carry
over
to
every
anti-discrimination
provision.
1982,
of
course,
uses
different
language
to
begin
with
and,
more
importantly,
is...
is
passed
under
congress'
power
under
the
thirteenth
amendment,
which
is
the
broadest
conceivable--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--no,
sir.
discrimination
is
not
even
in...
is
not
even
in
title...
rather,
in
1982.
so
the
language
is
very
different--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--i'll
have
to
confess
i
don't...
it
does
say
something
like
every
person
shall
have
the
same
right
as...
dot,
dot,
dot,
as
white
persons.
but
so
the...
the
language
frankly
is
pretty
different,
and
the
more
fundamental
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
even
if
that's
true
for...
for
that
statute
passed
under
that
constitutional
power,
here
we
are
talking,
as
justice
kennedy
made
clear
at
the
very
outset
of
the
argument
about
a
spending
clause
statute,
where
it
is
required
that
conditions
on
the
acceptance
of
federal
funds
be
express,
and
it
is
not
clear
to
me
where
the
birmingham
board
would
have
gotten
its
clear
notice
in
this
case.
if
you
can
imagine--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--i
agree,
and...
and
if...
and
if
the
birmingham
board,
which
i
trust
it
did,
looked
to
the
regulation
here,
what
it
would
have
found
is
a
regulation
not
that
clarifies
the
substantive
scope
of
title
ix,
but
instead
that...
that
manages
the
internal
operating
procedures
for
official
agency
investigations.
so
to
be
sure,
the
birmingham
board
was
on
notice
that
it
could
not
retaliate
in...
in
the
business
of
an
official
ocr
investigation,
and
if
it
did,
it
would
be
subject
to
administrative
enforcement,
but
it
was...
it
was
not
on
notice
either
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
generic
anti-retaliation
prohibition,
much
less
the
fact
that
if
it
violated
any
such
nonexistent--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--and...
and
with
respect,
i
think
there
is
a
difference,
particularly
given
the
clear
notice
requirements
that
this
court
has...
has
used
in
spending
clause
cases
between
retaliation
in
the
context
of
an
ocr
investigation
and
retaliation
generally,
but...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
justice
stevens,
may
i
respond?
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
even
granting
your
assumption,
justice
ginsburg,
what
is
painfully
not
clear
is
that
the...
is
that
the
birmingham
board
would
be
subject
to...
to
a
private
right
of
action
for
damages
and
fees
even
in...
in
the
event
that
there
were
some
generally
applicable
anti-retaliation
provision.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
