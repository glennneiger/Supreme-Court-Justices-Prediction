justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
there
was...
there
was...
let's
go
back
to
this
for
just
a
moment...
an
administrative
remedy
available
for
retaliation
expressly
under
the
regs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
this
petitioner
seek
an
administrative
remedy
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
the
administrative
remedy
have
allowed
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--had
it
been
sought?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that's
it.
it
would
not
have
permitted
a
restoration
of
the
job
to
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--petitioner.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
know
if
administrative
sanctions
have
been
imposed
under
title
ix
against
schools?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gornstein,
do
you
have
any
light
to
shed
on
the
extent
to
which
administrative
sanctions
have
ever
been
imposed
against
schools
and...
and
the
feasibility
of
going
that
route?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
what
occurred
here
can
amount
to
a
direct
violation
of
the
statute
as
discrimination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
would
congress
then
in
some
statutes
expressly
cover
retaliation
and
in
others
not?
i
mean,
that's
a
little
odd,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it...
it's
arguable
except
that
mr.
jackson
was
not
discriminated
against
because
of
his
gender.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--exactly
like
title
vii,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
regulation
did
tell
the
school
not
to
retaliate
in
effect.
tell
me,
does
the
record
disclose
what
happened
to
the
petitioner,
jackson?
what...
what
has
been
the
result
of
all
this?
does
the
record
tell
us
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
tell
us
that
he
was
removed
as
coach?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
tell
us
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we...
we
can't...
you
don't
base
your
argument
on
giving
some
legal
effect
to
denial
of
certiorari--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
is
that,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
because
no
remedy
is
available,
or
is
it
because
there
are
just
very
few
instances
giving
rise
to
such?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
retaliation
here
by
virtue
of
a
complaint
of
violation
of
title
ix?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
should
decide
it
on
that
assumption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
petitioner,
roderick
jackson,
is
a
teacher
in
the
birmingham
alabama
public
schools.
he
sued
the
birmingham
board
of
education
alleging
that
the
board
had
violated
title
ix
of
the
education
amendments
of
1972
by
retaliating
against
him
because
he
had
complained
about
sex
discrimination
in
the
high
school's
athletic
program.
because
this
case
was
decided
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
we
accept
the
allegations
of
jackson's
complaint
as
true.
according
to
the
complaint,
jackson
had
been
an
employee
of
the
birmingham
school
district
for
over
10
years.
in
1993,
he
was
hired
to
serve
as
a
physical
education
teacher
and
the
girls'
basketball
coach.
while
jackson
was
at
ensley
high
school,
he
discovered
that
the
girls'
team
was
not
receiving
equal
funding
and
equal
access
to
athletic
equipment
and
facilities.
he
began
complaining
to
his
supervisors
about
the
unequal
treatment
of
the
girls'
team,
but
his
complaints
went
unanswered.
the
school
failed
to
remedy
the
situation.
instead,
he
began
to
receive
negative
work
evaluations
and
ultimately
was
removed
as
the
girls'
coach
in
may
2001.
after
his
coaching
duties
were
terminated,
jackson
filed
the
instant
lawsuit
in
federal
district
court.
he
alleged,
among
other
things,
that
the
board
violated
title
ix
by
retaliating
against
him
for
protesting
the
discrimination
against
the
girls'
team.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
grounds
that
title
ix's
private
cause
of
action
does
not
include
claims
of
retaliation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
agreed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
eleventh
circuit's
judgment.
title
ix
provides
that
no
person
in
the
united
states
shall
on
the
basis
of
sex
be
subjected
to
discrimination
under
any
education
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
more
than
25
years
ago,
in
cannon
versus
university
of
chicago,
we
held
that
title
ix
includes
an
implied
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
its
prohibition
on
intentional
sex
discrimination.
we
hold
today
that
title
ix's
private
cause
of
action
encompasses
claims
of
retaliation
in
response
to
a
complaint
about
sex
discrimination.
retaliating
against
a
person
because
that
person
has
complained
of
sex
discrimination
is
a
form
of
intentional
sex
discrimination.
it
is
a
type
of
discrimination
because
the
complainant
is
being
subjected
to
differential
treatment.
it
is
on
the
basis
of
sex
because
it
is
an
intentional
response
to
the
nature
of
the
complaint
to
that
an
alligation
of
sex
discrimination.
we
do
not
decide
today
whether
jackson
should
prevail
on
the
merits.
we
hold
only
that
his
complaint
should
not
have
been
dismissed
and
he
is
entitled
to
offer
evidence
to
support
his
claim.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
kennedy.
