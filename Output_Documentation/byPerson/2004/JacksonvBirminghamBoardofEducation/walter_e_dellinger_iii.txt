mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
decision
below,
title
ix
stands
alone
as
the
only
major
civil
rights
statute
that
would
permit
retaliation
against
those
who
complain
that
the
law
is
being
violated.
there
are
at
least
a
half
a
dozen
anti-discrimination
laws
that
do
not
contain
a
separate
retaliation
provision,
and
every
one
of
them
has
been
found
to
prohibit
retaliation
as
one
kind
of
discrimination.
there's
a
reason
for
that.
anti-discrimination
laws
simply
can't
be
effective
if
threats
of
retaliation
are
allowed
to
chill
those
who
would
seek
to
bring
their
institutions
into
compliance.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
true,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
understand
that
other
step,
and
i
think
that
was
largely
resolved
in
cannon
v.
the
city
of
chicago,
a
decision
which
this
court
upheld
a
right
of
action
to
enforce
title
ix,
even
though
there
was
also
administrative
remedies
available
and
which
was
validated
by
congress,
as
this
court...
every
member
of
this
court
recognized
in...
in
sandoval.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
in
this
case,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
two
established
principles
together
that
are
settled
support
this
cause
of
action.
the
first
is
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
to
enforce
title
ix.
that's
cannon
through
congress,
through
sandoval,
through...
your
opinion
in
sandoval
acknowledges
that
cannon
is
solid
law
and,
the
second
point,
that
the
statute
itself
is
violated.
title
ix
is
violated
by
retaliatory
action
against
coach
jackson.
he's...
and...
and
this
is
an
important
part
of
title
ix
because,
particularly
here,
people
like
coach
jackson
need
to
come
forward
because
students
are
often
minors.
they're
not
in
the
best
position
to
know
the
budgets.
it
is
people
like
coach
jackson
who
make
it
work,
and
indeed,
i
think
what
is
recognized
about
the...
about
the
cause
of
action
for
retaliation
is
that
it
is
very
important
to
enable
people
to
bring
their
institutions
into
compliance
without
resorting
to
litigation.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
scalia,
the
burden,
of
course,
is
on
the
plaintiff
to
demonstrate
causation.
and
you
should
take
great
comfort
from
the
fact,
the
court
can
take
great
comfort
from
the
fact
that
retaliation
has
been
established
as
a
violation
of
all
of
the
major
civil
rights
statutes,
going
back
to
30
years
to
title
vi--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
congress
has
taken
a
different
approach.
in
some
cases,
there
would
be
a
textual
problem.
title
vii,
for
example,
speaks
of
discrimination
based
on
such
individual's
race
or
national
origin.
title...
and...
and
therefore,
it
might
need
a
specific
retaliation
provision.
title
ix
speaks
upon...
about
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
and
here
i
think
to...
to
allay
your
concern
about
the
coach,
we
have
had...
title
ix's
retaliation
provision
has
been
the
established
law.
it
was
the
law
at
the
time
congress...
it
was
understood,
at
the
time
congress
enacted
title
ix,
that
the
identical
wording
of
title
vi
had
been
construed
by
the
administrative
agency
to
include
a
cause
of
action
for
retaliation.
congress
enacted
title
ix
against
the
background
of
the
sullivan
decision,
which
had
recognized
that
discrimination
can
include
retaliation.
so
that
it
comes
as
no
surprise
that
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
addressed
this
issue
has
found
that
there's
retaliation
under
title
ix.
in
over
30
years,
there...
at
most
we
can
find
140
reported
cases
in
the
federal
system
where
there
is
a
claim
for
retaliation
under
title
ix,
and
under
title
ix
and
all
of
the
other
discrimination
provisions,
courts
have
found
it
perfectly
satisfactory
to
work
out
the
causation
requirements
and...
in...
in
dealing
with
retaliation
cases.
now,
here,
what
the
respondent
did
is
they
discharged
the
coach
who
was
seeking
equal
treatment
for
girls.
when
it
singled
coach
jackson
out
for
adverse
treatment,
it
was
discriminating,
and
when
it
did
so,
because
he
was
seeking
equal
treatment
for
girls,
it
was
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
sex.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
absolutely.
first
of
all,
the...
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
says...
in
the
petition
appendix
at
3a,
the
court
of
appeals
says
we
assume
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal
that
the
board
retaliated
against
jackson
for
complaining
about
perceived
title
ix
violations.
but
for
the
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex,
he
would
not
have
complained,
and
he
not...
had
he
not
made
a
complaint
about
sex
discrimination,
he
wouldn't
have
lost
his
position.
he
is
denied
the
benefit
of
coaching
in
the
program.
he's
denied
the
ability
to
participate
in
this
federally
funded
program
as
a
coach,
and
he
is
discriminated
against
by
being
singled
out
for
retaliation.
and
this
is
not
a
case
in
which...
that
has
concern...
i
mean,
justice
kennedy
raised
the
question
about
this
being
a
funding
case,
and
i
understand
the
special
sensitivity
that
the
court
has
about
rules
that
are
based
upon
spending
requirements
where
you
want
to
be
sure
that
states
understand
what
they're
agreeing
to
when
they
accept
the
federal
funds.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
it
could
not
have
been
anticipated
when
those
funds
were
accepted.
at
that
time,
at
the
time
these
funds
were
accepted,
which
would
have
been
about
1999
or
2000,
title
ix's
ban
on
sex
discrimination
was
itself,
of
course,
universally
known.
retaliation
was
understood
to
be
part
and
parcel
of
that.
we
had
had
30
years
where
both
the
department
of
education
and--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
think
the
court--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
i...
i--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
understand
that.
here,
first
of
all,
when
congress
acted,
unlike
the
earlier
time
when
it
passed
title
vi,
when
congress
passed
title
ix,
it
was
a
background
in
the
law
from
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park
that...
that
retaliation
was
considered
a
part
of
discrimination.
the
title
vi
regulations
were
themselves
well
known
based
on
identical
language,
virtually
verbatim
language.
it
provided
for
retaliation.
and
moreover,
this
court
has
recently
as
the
davis
case,
franklin
and
davis,
and
in
the
north
haven
case
has
found
that
employment
discrimination,
sexual
harassment
by
teachers
and
peer-on-peer
sexual
harassment
all
come
within
title
ix
and
have,
therefore,
agreed
that
cannon
v.
the
city
of...
v.
the
university
of
chicago
creates
that
cause
of
action.
now,
this
case
is
actually
a
lot
easier
than
davis,
even
taking
into
account
the
concerns
that...
that
you
and
other
justices
expressed
there,
because
this
is
not
a
case
where
liability
is
being
imposed,
you
know,
for
the
acts
of
third
parties
like
students
over
whom
you
may
have
limited
control.
this
is
deliberately
undertaken
actions
by
the
responsible
officials
acting
intentionally.
it's
not
a
novel
concept
the
way
one
could
argue
that
peer-on-peer
sexual
harassment
was
as
a
part
of
discrimination.
but
it's
been
accepted
for
more
than
30
years
by
the
responsible
federal
agency.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
scalia,
with...
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
there's
any
way,
when
the
district
accepted
these
funds,
that
they
could
have
reasonably
relied
on
the
assumption
that
they
would
be
free
to
retaliate
against
people
who
tried
to
comply--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
he
did
not
seek
an
administrative
remedy.
he
went
through
the
school
system
itself
at
every
level.
he
went
through
five
different
levels,
following
the
chain
of
command.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--here,
as
in
franklin,
as
in
davis,
as
in
cannon
v.
the
university
of
chicago,
as
in
every
one
of
this
court's
title
ix
cases,
indeed,
as
in
all
of
its
title
vi
cases
involving
federal
funds
with
race,
you
can
call
this
to
attention
of
the
office
of
civil
rights
of
the
relevant
agency
and
they
can
begin
an
inquiry.
ultimately
they
have
the
authority
of
the
draconian
sanction
of
cutting
off
the
funds
to
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
not
part
of
the...
the
administrative
process
is
only
about
institutional
funding,
which
is
why
the
court
has
consistently
upheld
the
right
to
bring
these
actions
for
what
are
violations
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that...
that
is
absolutely
right.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
i'm
sure
there
have
been
some
instances
in
which
there
have
been
administrative
sanctions
under
title
ix.
and
i
don't...
i
do
not
have
figures
on
those,
justice
o'connor.
but
let
me--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--let
me
suggest--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
but
i
think--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
actually
have--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
if
it's
never...
i...
i--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--justice--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
do
have
an
answer,
first,
for
justice
ginsburg's
question
from
ms.
greenberger.
the
sanction
has
never
been
imposed
under
title
ix
of
cutting
off
funds.
and
it--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
certainly
not
what--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--coach...
coach
jackson
would
have
sought,
and...
and
because
that
process
is
not
one
that's
responsive
to
the
individual
case...
if
you're
down
in
birmingham,
alabama,
the
idea
that
there
is
some
office
that
has
control
over
federal
funds
that's
never
imposed
a
sanction,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is...
and
it's
the
reason--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
may
well
be
the
case,
absolutely.
and
coach
jackson--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--because--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--because
in
this
case
people
like
coach
jackson...
it's
hard
enough
for
coach
jackson
to
come
forward.
if
he's
not
able
to...
if
he's
not
protected
and
able
to
come
forward,
if
retaliation
is
possible,
then
you
can't
expect
the...
the
teenagers
themselves
to
carry
this
burden.
and
in
fact,
it's
the
reason
this
court
recognizes
a
private
cause
of
action
in
franklin
and
in
davis
and
in
cannon
itself,
that
you're
not
going
to
protect
the
whistle
blower
and
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
come
forward.
and
it's
not
just
whistle
blowers,
justice
kennedy.
it's
people
that
want
to
make
their
institutions
comply
and
when
those
efforts
at
compliance
result
in
penalties
against
them.
it
has
not
led
to
an
excessive
amount
of
litigation,
but
it
has
been
very
effective
in
giving
people
comfort
to
know
that
they
can't
be
retaliated
against.
and...
and
i...
i
understand
the...
going
to
the
necessity,
but
i
do
think
i'm
very
comfortable
with
the
statute
because
it
is
a
form
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
it
is
part
and
parcel.
the
history
of
discrimination,
on
which
title
vi
drew,
was
that
firing
people
from
their
jobs
is
what
you
did
when
they
complained
about
discrimination,
when
they
tried
to
vote,
when
they
tried
to
enroll
their
students
in
schools,
and
it
is
part
and
parcel
of
that
discrimination.
and
it
is
discrimination
against
coach
jackson
for
his
actions
on
behalf
of
sex.
thank
you.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
should
make
it
clear
that
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
create
or
infer
a
new
cause
of
action.
we're
asking
the
court
to
interpret
the
cause
of
action
that
the
court
itself
recognized
in
cannon
v.
the
university
of
chicago,
that
was
validated
by
congress.
it
was
reaffirmed
in
the
court's
opinion
in
sandoval.
and
when
you
look
at
the
scope
of
that...
of
that
prohibition,
that
cause
of
action,
why
would
it
not
extend
to
retaliation?
the
idea
that
you--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
understand.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
practice
of
congress
has
not
been
consistent
on
incorporating
express
provisions
sometimes
because
of
language
differences,
but
there
are
half
a
dozen
major
statutes
that
the
courts
of
appeal
have
consistently
assumed
included
retaliation
as
part
of
discrimination.
section
1981,
section
1982,
title
vi,
1982
as
determined
by
this
court,
parts
of
the
rehabilitation
act
have
all
been
construed
that
way.
and
why
would
they
not?
the
notion
that
you
have
to
admit
geraldine
cannon
to
the
university
of
chicago
medical
school,
you
can't
discriminate
against
her
on
the
basis
of
sex,
but
then
you
could
turn
around
and
expel
her
for
complaining
about
your
admissions
policy
makes
no
sense.
in
this
case,
relying
upon
the
vagaries
of
what
any
administration
might
do
about
enforcement
is
not
necessarily
what
congress
wanted,
and
that
was
this
court's
decision
in
cannon.
and
it's
reaffirmed
it
frankly--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
in
this
case,
it
has
been
known
to
effectuate
anti-discrimination
laws
in
order
to
bring
them
about
by
allowing
people
to
step
forward.
the
last
point
they
make
is
that
even
if
there's
a
cause
of
action,
and
even
if
the
cause
of
action
covers
retaliation,
it
cannot
be
brought
by
coach
jackson
because
he's
not
also
the
victim
of
the
underlying
discrimination.
that
makes
no
sense
in
law
or
in
logic.
if
the
captain
of
the
boys'
basketball
team
joins
with
the
captain
of
the
girls'
basketball
team
in
a
supportive
way
to
say,
they're
just
not
treating
girls'
basketball
equally
and
fairly,
and
they're
both
suspended
from
their
teams
or
dropped
from
the
honor
society
in
retaliation,
it
makes
no
sense.
either
they
both
have...
they've
both
been
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
sex
because
they're
trying
to
rectify
sex
discrimination
or
neither
is.
and
in
this
case,
it's
going
to
be
critically
important
that
this
valuable
statute,
which
has
meant
so
much
for
athletic
and
academic
opportunities
for
women,
to
have
people
like
coach
jackson
able
to
be
confident
that
they've
got
a
right
that
they
can
enforce
that
will
allow
them
to
come
forward
within
the
school
itself
and
try
to
rectify
these
anomalies
in
and
under
title
ix.
thank
you.
