justice
antonin
scalia
by
whom?
by
which
one
of
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
flip
a
coin?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
is
that?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
due
process
requires
that
there
be
enough
evidence
to...
for
a
jury
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that...
that
the
person
was
the
shooter.
and
if
in...
if
there
is,
indeed,
in
both
cases
enough
such
evidence,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
denial
of
due
process,
and
that
the
usual
manner
of
accommodating
for
that
apparent
injustice
is...
is
for
the
governor
to
grant
clemency
to
one
of
the
two,
have
him
figure
out
which
one
of
the
two
wasn't
the
shooter,
or
to
apply
for...
for
reopening
of
the...
of
the...
of
one
of
cases.
but
i
don't
know
that
there
is
automatically
a
due
process
violation
which
allows
one
or
the
other
of
the
cases...
proper
convictions.
each
one
is
fully
proper.
i
don't
know
that
there's
a
due
process
violation
that
allows
one
of
them
to
be
set
aside.
justice
antonin
scalia
due...
due
process
doesn't
mean
perfection.
it
doesn't
mean
that
each
jury
has
to
always
reach
the
right
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
the
facts,
even
if
he
hadn't
shot
the
wife
to
death,
which
was
what
the
prosecution
was
for,
he
had
tried
to
kill
the
husband,
shooting
him
twice
in
the
head?
justice
antonin
scalia
from
point-blank
range.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
there
was
some
discussion
that
the...
that
the
lying,
seriously
wounded
husband
heard
between
the
two
perpetrators,
and
then
there
was
shooting
of
the
wife.
whether
he
pulled
the
trigger
or
not,
could
that
possibly
make
a
difference?
he
did
pull
the
trigger
trying
to
kill
the
husband.
is
it
difficult
to...
to
think
that...
that
he
willingly
allowed
his...
his
cohort
to
do
the
same
to
the
wife?
i...
i
can't
imagine
it
would
make
any
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
could...
could
i
get
one
fact?
wesley
didn't
confess
or
we
don't
know
that
he
confessed.
he...
he
said
he
wasn't
the
shooter
at
trial,
didn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
was
introduced
was...
was
the
testimony
of
one
of
his
jailhouse
companions
who
said
that
wesley
had
told
him
that
he
was
the
shooter.
so
who
was
the
shooter
was...
was
as
much
an
issue
in
wesley's
trial
as
it
was
in
stumpf's
trial,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
page
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
was
the
due
process
violation
here?
you're
talking
about
due
process
in
the
second
trial,
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--was
in
the
first
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
the
trial
that
you're
trying
to
get
set
aside
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
was.
they're...
they're
just...
they're
just
arguing
that
the
evidence
we
introduced
supported
the
jury
verdict.
what...
what
is
wrong
with
arguing
that?
there's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not...
not
if
they
said
in
the
second
trial
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he's
the
shooter.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
because
it
seems
to
me
they...
they
would
have
two
arguments.
one
is
even
if
he
wasn't
the
shooter,
you...
you
should...
you
would
have
imposed
the
death
penalty
anyway,
but
argument
number
two
is,
wait
a
minute.
you
know,
yes,
we...
we
don't
know
who
the
shooter
is
but
there's
a...
there
was
no
violation
of
due
process
here.
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
for
you
to
find
that
he
was
the
shooter.
that
evidence
is
still
there.
do
you
expect
them
to
throw
away
that
argument?
i
mean,
it's...
it's
very
true
and
it
goes
to
whether
this
conviction
and
sentence
deserve
to
be
set
aside.
justice
antonin
scalia
she
asked
as
aider
or
abetter,
not
as
shooter.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
a
state
appellate
court
had
effectively
reweighed
and
effectively
resentenced,
saying
that
this
additional
evidence
would,
in
our
view,
have
made
no
difference.
and
we...
we
allow
that
to
happen
all
the
time.
we
speculate
as
to
what
the...
what
the
sentencer
would
have
done
had
an
invalid
factor
not
been
there.
i
mean,
when...
when
a...
an
aggravating
factor
is...
is
invalidated,
the
state
supreme
court
can
determine,
you
know,
whether
the
same
sentence
of
death
would
have
been
imposed
even
without
that
aggravating
factor.
why
is
this
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if...
what
if
wesley
comes
in
with
a...
with
a
motion
to
vacate
now
and...
and
he
points
to
the
inconsistency
with
the...
with
the
stumpf
trial?
would
he
also
be
entitled
to
get
his
sentence
vacated
because
of
the
same
inconsistency
that
you're
pointing
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
a
jury,
having
found
both
of
them
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
possibly
on
a
basis
that...
or
not
a
jury
but
the
judges
and
possibly
on
a
basis
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
they
were
the
shooter,
you
think
both
of
them
are
entitled
to
have
the
death
sentence
vacated.
i
think
that's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
one?
i
mean,
doesn't
wesley
have
just
as
much
of
a
complaint
as
your
client
does?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
that's...
that's
my
mistake.
