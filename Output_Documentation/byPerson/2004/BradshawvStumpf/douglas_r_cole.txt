mr.
douglas
r.
cole
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
john
stumpf
pleaded
guilty
to
the
aggravated
murder
of
mary
jane
stout.
the
evidence
shows
he
is,
in
fact,
guilty
of
that
crime.
the
court
below,
nonetheless,
vacated
his
conviction
on
habeas
review
citing
two
grounds.
its
reasoning
on
each
directly
conflicts
with
this
court's
opinions
and
significantly
undermines
the
finality
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
state
court
criminal
convictions
based
on
pleas.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
there
was
a
separate
mitigation
hearing
under
ohio
law,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
your
honor,
the
state
said
that
they...
they
thought
there
was
evidence
to
support
that.
they
said,
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
conclude
he
was
the
actual
shooter,
and
that's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
186.
so
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--the
court...
or
i'm
sorry.
the
prosecutor
argued
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
show
it.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
your
honor,
after...
at
the
time
of
the
original
sentencing
hearing
there
was
no
other
evidence,
this
new
evidence
of
which
he's
complaining--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--didn't
exist.
when
it
came
into
being,--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--he
then
moved
to
vacate
his
sentence
at
the
state--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--court.
and
the
judge
there
from
the
original
panel--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--one
of
the
judges
said,
it
may
have
made
a
difference.
of
course,
they
had
before
them
a
motion
to
vacate
the...
the
sentence
at
that
time,
and
they
denied
that
motion.
so
apparently
it
didn't
make
a
difference
to
that
judge.
two
other
ohio
courts
have
independently
reweighed
all
of
the
evidence
and
found
that
the
death
sentence
was
appropriate.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
i...
i
guess
that
would
be
conceivable,
your
honor,
although
i
note
that
there's
only
one
due
process
claim
he's
making.
he's
making
one
form
of
constitutional
error
claim
predicated
on
the
due
process
clause,
and
if
there
was
no
due
process
violation
with
respect
to
his
conviction,
which
is
the
claim
that
he
was
pressing
before
the
sixth
circuit,
there's
similarly
no
due
process
violation
with
respect
to
his
sentence.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
in
his
sixth
circuit
briefs,
he
does...
in
a
section
that's
entitled
i
hereby
challenge
my
conviction,
he
does
also
note
in
that
section
that
he's
got
some
concerns
about
his
sentencing
hearing.
so
i
don't
know
that
he's
waived
that.
but
i
don't
believe
that
there's
a
valid
due
process
claim
that
he
has
with
regard
to
either
his
conviction
or
his
sentence.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
because
his
theory,
justice
souter,
is
the
same
with
regard
to
both.
he
says
this...
the
use
of
this--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--that's
conceivable,
your
honor.
we
understand
that
the...
we
understood
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
to
be
directed
toward
his
conviction.
so
the--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--the
thrust
of
our
arguments
before
this
court
were
directed
towards
the
conviction.
the
other
side
then
raised,
oh,
the
state
has
waived
their
claim
about
the
sentencing,
and...
and
we
were
just
making--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--clear
that,
a,
we
haven't,
but
b,
in
any
event,
the
due
process
theory
sounds
the
same
in
both.
and
so
if
there's
not
a
due
process
problem,
with
respect
to
these
arguably
inconsistent
theories,
then
there's
not
a
due
process
problem
with
respect
to
his
sentence
either.
he
hasn't
brought
any
other
set
of
facts--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
your
honor,
referring
to
page
187
and
188
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
says,
given
those
circumstances,
although
we
believe
the
evidence
does
prove
he
was
the
shooter
of
mary
jane
stout,
legally,
technically,
i
don't
believe
it
makes
any
difference
when
you
have
two
people
acting
in
concert
for
the
joint
and
unlawful
purpose
of
committing
an
aggravated
robbery
and...
and
murder
results.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
he
said
there's
ample
evidence
from
which
the
court
could
conclude--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--in
so
many
words,
your
honor,
in
connection
with
the
mitigation
phase,
in...
in
connection
with
the
factual
basis
hearing
even,
he
put
on
the
evidence
saying,
you
know,
mr.
stumpf
says
he
wasn't
the
shooter
and
gives
a
lot
of
reasons
to
discount
that
evidence.
so
he's
arguing
that
in
fact
mr.
stumpf
was
the
shooter.
i
think
it's
a
fair
implication
if
he
doesn't
say
the
express
words,
but
it's
a
fair
implication.
of
course,
at
that
time,
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
mr.
wesley
had
not
yet
been
extradited
from
texas.
he
hadn't
even
made
this
alleged
statement
to
mr.
eastman.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
to
vacate
the
sentence,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
a,
i
think
that's
an
inference
that's
supported
by
the
fact
that
he
voted
to
deny
the
motion,
but
b,
in
any
event,
there's
been
an
independent
reweighing
of
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
ohio
intermediate
appellate
court
and
that
court
said
that...
very
specifically
said,
even
if
we
didn't
believe
he
was
the
principal...
or
principal
offender,
the
actual
shooter...
we
do
believe
that.
but
even
if
we
didn't,
the
death
sentence
here
would
be
appropriate.
and
this
court
noted
in
clemons
that
an
independent
reweighing
by
an
appellate
court
of
the
evidentiary
record
can
be
sufficient
to
secure...
or
to--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
justice...
justice
ginsburg,
the...
the
evidence
wasn't
available
at
the
time
of
the
original
sentence.
so
the
failure
to
have
that
part
of
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
original
sentencing
hearing,
of
course,
can't
violate
due
process.
and
then
the
question
would
be,
did
something
that
happened
later
violate
due
process?
but
i
just
don't
think
it
can
be
the
case
that
anytime
new
evidence
comes
up
that
might
cause
a
judge
to
say,
boy,
if
we'd
have
had
that
evidence
before
when
we...
when
we
reached
the
sentencing
decision,
we
might
have
reached
a
different
result--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i...
i
think
it
depends,
at
least
in
part,
on
what
role
that
finding
played.
if
those
two
verdicts
each
had
as
an
essential
component
this
fact,
this
person
is
the
shooter
and
this
person
is
the
shooter,
so
that
the
verdicts
are
necessarily
inconsistent
so
that
we
know
the
state
has
actually
got
someone
in
jail
they're
punishing
that's
innocent,
we
would
concede
there
may
be
a
substantive
due
process
right
of
the...
against
the
state
because
the
state
at
that
point--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--your
honor,
i...
i
think
that's
a
great
question.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
i...
i
think
the
point
is
probably
both
would
have
some
kind
of
claim
in
that
i
don't
think
the
state
can
pursue
and
convict
two
people
on
necessarily
inconsistent
theories
because
at
that--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--and
i
don't
know
that
there
is
either,
your
honor.
we'd
be
willing
to
concede
that
for
purposes
of
this
argument
because
even
if
there
is,
it
doesn't
apply
here--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i...
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
and
i
hate
to
argue
against
my
position,
so
i...
i
do
this
gently.
but
at
the
same
time,
the
court
has
noted
and...
and
one
of
the
old
saws
of
american
law
is...
is
it's
better
one
guilty
person
should
go
free
than
that
one
innocent
person
should
be
punished.
and
if
the
state
knows,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
it
secured
two
convictions
for
a
crime
that
only
one
committed,
the
state
knows
at
that
point
that
it's
punishing
at
least
one
innocent
person
and
that
might
violate--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--the
new
evidence
came
to
light
some
6
months
after
his
plea
was
entered
and
after
the
sentence
was
announced.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
to...
to
a
jailhouse
informant,
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
prosecutor
put
that
evidence
on
at
trial,
at
wesley's
trial,
but
it's
interesting
to
note
what
he
did
with
that
evidence
at
wesley's
trial.
he
put
it
on
but
then
in
closing
very
expressly
noted
that
while
there's
been
this
evidence,
even
if
you
don't
believe
he's
the
principal
offender,
you
can
still
find
him
guilty
of
aggravated
murder.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
your
honor,
first,
i...
i
don't
think
they're...
he
was
without
process.
mr.
stumpf
had
abundant
process
within
the
state
system.
he
got
all
the
evidence--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
your
honor,
the...
again,
the
intermediate
appellate
court
independently
reweighed
this
evidence
and
concluded
that
even
if
we
conclude
that
mr.
stumpf
is
not
the
shooter,
even
if
that's
our...
our
conclusion...
it
isn't,
but
even
were
we
to
conclude
that,
the
death
penalty
would
still
be
appropriate
here.
so
there's
been
an
independent
reweighing
of
the
evidence
minus
the
mitigating
evidence
or
minus
the--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--yes,
your
honor.
he...
the
prosecutor,
in
fact,
stipulated
to
the
admissibility
of
the
eastman
and
the
wesley
evidence
from
wesley's
trial
back
into
the
stumpf
proceeding
in
the
original
trial
court
before
the
two
judges...
the
two
of
the
three
judges
that
were
remaining
at
that
point,
and
then--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--that
was
part
of
the
record
on
appeal.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
indictment
in
wesley's
case
included
a
specification
that
he
was
the
principal
offender,
so
at
the
very
least,
the
indictment
would--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--the
only
way
to
be
the
principal
offender
under
that
specification
is
to
be
the
triggerman.
so
that...
that's
clear
from
the
face
of
the
indictment
in...
in
wesley's
case
that
the
state
had
argued
that.
now,
the
jury,
importantly
in
wesley's
case,
found
that
he
should
be
acquitted
on
that
aggravating
circumstance.
it's
not
an
element
of
the
crime,
but
it's
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
that
the
state
could
rely
on
in
seeking
the
death
penalty
in
wesley's
case,
and
the
jury
specifically
rejected
that
aggravating
circumstance
and...
and
found
that
the
state
had
not
proved
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
throughout
the...
throughout
the
appellate
process,
with
regard
to
the
sentence,
the
state's
attorney
argued
that,
yes,
there's
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
you
could
conclude
that
he's
the
actual
shooter,
but
in
any
event,
it
doesn't
matter.
and
the...
the
state's
attorney
was
correct
in
that,
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law,
aiders
and
abetters
can
both
be
found
guilty
of
aggravated
murder
under
ohio
law
and
are
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
the
two...
the
two
aggravating
circumstances...
i'm
sorry.
the
one
aggravating
circumstance
that
remained
after
the
plea
deal
turned
merely
on
the
reason
why
mrs.
stout
had
been
put
to
death.
it
did
not
turn
at
all
on
who
was
the
person
who
put
her
to
death.
so
as
an
accomplice,
aider,
and
abetter,
with
liability
for
the
aggravated
murder,
he
was
also
subject
to
the
death
penalty
under
that--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i...
i
think
it's
definitely
a
fact
that
the
court
weighs,
although
here
we
have
evidence
that
at
least
one
ohio
court
took
that
possibility
into
account
and
said
even
in
light
of
that
fact--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--we
still
conclude
that
the
death
sentence
is
appropriate.
so
i
don't
know
that
we
can
say
that
in
this
case
it
in
any
way
would
change
the
outcome.
in
fact,
the
record--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
this
did
go
back
in
front
of
the
two...
two
of
the
three
original
sentencers
and
they
declined
to
allow
him
to
vacate
his
sentence.
the
intermediate
appellate
court
then
independently
reweighed
and
expressly
said,
whether
he's
the
shooter
or
not,
he's
eligible
for
the
death
sentence.
so
there
have
been
a
number
of
ohio
judges
that
have--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--twice
at
the
head
from
essentially
point-blank
range,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
right.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
your
honor,
we
agree
and
that
certainly
falls
well
within
the...
the
range
of
culpability
that
this
court
set
out
in--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
first,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
guess
what
the
judges
would
do
because
the
judges
did
what
they
did.
they
denied
the
motion
to
vacate
and
then--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--and
certainly
the
intermediate--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
the
intermediate
appellate
court
expressly
said
that
its
determination
did
not
turn
on
who
had
pulled
the
trigger,
that
they
would
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
independent
of
who
pulled
the
trigger.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--that's--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--that's--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i
would
think
that's--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--but--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--but,
justice
breyer,
i
think
it...
it's
always
going
to
be
the
case
that
after
a
sentence
is
announced,
there's
the
possibility
that
new
evidence
might
come
up
that
would
cause
us
to
say
we
can't
know
for
sure
what
this
panel
would
have
done
with
that
new
evidence.
and
so
there
needs
to
be--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--mr.
wesley.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
but,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
have
been
the
state's
position.
i
don't
believe
after
the
wesley
trial,
that
the
balance
of
the
evidence
necessarily
showed
that
wesley
was
the
shooter
versus
stumpf.
that
was
one
person's
testimony.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
they
did,
your
honor,
and
mr.
wesley...
it
isn't
as
though
all
the
new
evidence
is
in
mr.
stumpf's
favor.
mr.
wesley,
the
only
other
eyewitness
who's
testified,
came
and
sat
on
the
witness
stand
and
said,
yes,
mr.
stumpf
pulled
the
trigger.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
only
two
people
who
know
exactly
who
pulled
the
trigger
are
mr.
wesley
and
mr.
stumpf,
and
they
have
every
reason
to
point
their
finger
at
the
other
person.
so
if
that's--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--the
state...
and
i
would
encourage
the
court
to
look
at
the
state's
response
to
that
motion,
which
is
in
joint
appendix
at
126.
but
what
the
state
says
on
126
is...
essentially
there's
a
lot
of
agnosticism
in
the
response.
it
says,
look,
there's
this
new
evidence.
we
don't
know.
it
seems
like
from
this
record
you
could
conclude
that
stumpf
was
the
shooter,
but
then
the
state
says
even
deleting
that
finding,
even
if
you
don't
agree
with
us,
or
even
if
you
don't
agree
that's
the
case,
because
the
state
isn't
really
saying
this
is
our
position
anymore,
even
if
you
delete
that
finding,
there's
still
sufficient
evidence
here
to
support
a
death
penalty
against
mr.
stumpf.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
as
the
court
expressly...
or
as...
as
the
state
expressly
noted
in
its
closing
in
that
case--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--in
closing--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--in...
in
closing
at
that
trial,
your
honor,
the...
the
prosecutor
was
relatively
agnostic,
frankly.
he
said,
look,
you
could
conclude--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--he...
he
put
in
the
evidence,
and
then
he
said,
look,
from
this
evidence
you
could
conclude
that
wesley
was
the
shooter.
you
could
also--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
and
your
honor,
i...
i
think
if
he
could
show
wesley
was
the
shooter,
that
would,
of
course,
support
a
conviction
against
wesley,
but
he
recognized
that
the
jury
didn't
necessarily
need
to
believe
that,
and
in
fact,
he
wasn't
relying
on
that
in
order
to
secure
the
conviction.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
because,
your
honor,
the
state
is
not
the
fact
finder.
the
judge
is
the
fact
finder.
the
state
needs
to
put
the
evidence
in
and
allow
counsel
for
the
defendant,
counsel
for
the
state
to
argue
positions,
and
let
the
fact
finder
make
the
ultimate
determination.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
justice
ginsburg,
to
respond
to
your
question,
under
ohio
law
you
do
not
need
to...
to
plan
to
kill
the
witness
in
order
to
have
specific
intent
for
aggravated
murder.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
in
re
washington
and
state
v.
scott
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
say
that
participation
in
an
aggravated
robbery
where
that's
going
to
be
done
through
force
or
violence
or
in
a
manner
reasonably
likely
to
result
in
death
is
sufficient
to
support
a...
an
intent...
a...
an
inference
of
specific
intent.
so
there's...
there's
no
need
to
find
that
they
planned
to
kill
the
witnesses.
if...
if
i
heard
mr.
freedman
correctly,
he
admitted
that
wesley
would
not
have
a
due
process
argument
here
because
he
said
the
fact
finders
were
apprised
of
mr.
stumpf's
proceedings.
well,
exactly
the
same
is
true
in
mr.
stumpf's
case.
as
soon
as
that
testimony
became
available,
as
soon
as
mr....
as
the
prosecutor
had
knowledge
of
mr.
eastman's
testimony,
that
testimony
was
then
placed
back
in
the
record
for
further
proceedings
in
the
stumpf
matter.
the
prosecutor
made
arguments,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
due
process
clause
requires--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--hearing
on
the
motion
to
vacate
and
further
appellate
review.
i
don't
think
the
due
process
clause
requires
the
state
to
admit
the
ultimate
truth
of
everything
that
mr.
eastman
testified
to
at
that
other
trial.
the
question
was
did
they
have
a
good
faith
basis
for
putting
him
on,
and
they
did.
and
did
they
have
a
good
faith
basis
then
for
arguing
that
notwithstanding
what
he
said,
that
the
conviction
and
the
sentence
in
mr.
stumpf's
case
were
appropriate?
and
i
believe
the
record
supports
that
they
did
have
a
good
faith
basis
for
making
that
argument.
if
we
look
at
the
arguments
they
made,
they
were
arguments
in
the
nature
of,
look,
there's
this
evidence
in
the
record.
you
may
believe
it,
you
may
not.
either
way,
mr.
stumpf
is
correctly
eligible
for
the
death
sentence
under
ohio
law
and
that
sentence
is
appropriate.
and
the
courts
found,
based
on
that
argument,
that
mr.
stumpf
had
appropriately
been
sentenced
to
death.
this
court
has
noted
that
the
principal
function
of
habeas
is
to
assure
that
no
man
has
been
incarcerated
under
a
procedure
which
creates
an
impermissibly
large
risk
that
an
innocent
person
will
be
convicted.
well,
we
don't
have
that
risk
here.
stumpf
has
knowingly
and
voluntarily
pled
guilty,
removing
any
risk
about
that.
and
if
we
look
to
this
sentencing
hearing,
there's
no
risk
that
he
received
an
impermissibly
large
sentence
because
the
prosecutor
made
the
evidence
available,
and
stumpf's
counsel
used
that
evidence
and
argued
it,
and
the
court
simply
rejected
it.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
stop.
thank
you.
