justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what...
what
is
the
rule
if
there
are
two
successive...
there
are
successive
trials
with
different
defendants
and
there
can
only
be
one
shooter
and
in
each
trial
it's
found
that
the
defendant
is
the
shooter?
what
should
be
the
rule,
or
does
the...
does
the
second
person
get
the
advantage?
does
the
state
have
to
begin
all
over
again
with
both?
or...
or
does
the
state
have
no
obligation
to
correct
either?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
isn't
that...
isn't
one
of
the
answers
to
justice
breyer's
questions
that
you...
you
never
know
exactly
what
a
fact
finder
would
do.
what
you
have
to
deal
with
are
reasonable
likelihoods
and
reasonable
possibilities.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
when...
and
when
you
have
someone
who
shoots
the
first
person
and
is
obviously
attempting
to
kill
him,
and
then
there's
an
apparent
discussion...
not...
not
100
percent
clear
that
those
were
the
two
voices.
it's
pretty
clear
because
there
were
only
two
other
people
there.
so
we
talk
about
reasonable
likelihoods,
don't
we?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
now,
the...
the
jury
in
the
wesley
trial
rejected
that
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it's
at
the
bottom
of
page
187.
we're
on
this
same
point.
given
these
circumstances--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--187
like
the...
of
the
joint
appendix.
given
these
circumstances,
although
we
believe
the
evidence
does
prove
he
was
the
shooter,
i
don't
believe
it
makes
any
difference
when
you
have
two
people
acting
in
concert
for
the
joint
and
unlawful
purpose
of
committing
an
aggravating
robbery.
that's
at
the
top
of
188.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
there's
quite
a
difference
in...
in
case
a
where
you
say
our
position
is
that
stumpf
was
the
shooter,
pure
and
simple.
that's
it.
in
case
b,
they
say
we
think
stumpf
was
the
shooter.
we're
not
100
percent
sure,
but
he
should
get
the
death
penalty.
the
alternative
is
before
the
sentencer
and
the
sentencer
can
make
that
determination.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
state
had
said
on
motion
for
resentencing
in
stumpf's
trial,
your
honor,
we
took
the
position
that
wesley
was
the
shooter
in
wesley's
trial.
the
jury
disbelieved
that.
we
accept
the
jury's
verdict.
our
position
now
is
that...
that
stumpf
was
the
shooter.
we've
learned
from
the
jury
verdict
in
the
wesley
trial.
we've
had
12
people.
they
heard
the
evidence.
we'll
accept
that.
any
difference
in
that
case
and
what
we
have
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it...
it
would...
in
the
case
i
put,
would
your
argument
be
the
same,
and
if
so,
why?
