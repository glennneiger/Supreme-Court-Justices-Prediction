justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
no
doubt
that
they
could
have...
the
trier
of
fact
could
have
reached
the
same
conclusion.
but
i
guess
the
problem
is
that
when
you
go
back
to
reopen
the
evidence
the
second
time
and
the
judges
are
sitting
there,
someone
might
have
thought,
well,
the
husband
didn't
die,
and
we
don't
know
if
he
actually
pulled
the
trigger
on
the
wife.
and
we're
trying
to
guess
what
those
judges
would
have
done
if
they
thought
that.
i
don't
know.
it
could
be
that
people
don't
want
to
impose
capital
punishment
without
thinking
i
know
that
this
person
has
killed
somebody,
and
if
that's
so,
they
wouldn't
have
reached
the
same
conclusion.
now,
i
guess
that's
the
problem
because
at
that
time
on
reopening,
the
state
told
that
panel
of
judges
pretty
clearly
by
implication
that
the
state
thought
that
the
evidence
did
support
stumpf
having
pulled
the
trigger,
even
though
at
that
point
the
state
knew
and
indeed
referred
to
the
statement
to...
you
know,
the
confession
and
all
the
things
in
the
second
trial.
now,
what
do
you
think
about
that
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
denied
it,
but
as
i
read
what
the
ohio
court
said
after
the
denial,
i
thought
it
did
probably
rest
upon
their
determination
that
stumpf
had
pulled
the
trigger.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
think
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
that
then
i
think
i
got
my
impression
from,
and
of
course,
they
don't
know
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
fact
is
we
don't
know
what
that
original
panel
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
absolutely
right.
of
course,
that's
right.
we
can't
be
sure
what
they
would
have
done,
and
because
we
can't
be
sure
what
they
would
have
done,
i
guess
it
might
well
have
made
a
difference
that
the
state
told
that
panel
we
think
stumpf
pulled
the
trigger.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what
gives
rise
to
the
problem
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
state
say
when
it
comes
to
the
panel,
the
reopening
panel,
we'll
tell
you
something.
we
think,
indeed,
that's
what
we
argued,
that
the
state...
in
the
last
case
we
argued
that
stumpf
didn't
pull
the
trigger,
that
the
balance
of
evidence
is
against
that,
but
nonetheless,
he
should
be
sentenced
to
death.
that
would
make
your
position
absolutely
consistent
with
what
you
argued
in
that
second
trial
with
mr.--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--mr.
wesley.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
procedural
question
here?
when
i
read
the...
the
ohio
supreme
court
opinion,
my
impression
of
their
due
process
part
of
it
is
that
they
found
a
violation
because
of
the
inconsistency
between
the
wesley
trial
and
the
stumpf
sentencing
proceeding.
when
you
started
to
talk
to
justice
scalia,
you
agreed
that
couldn't
be
right.
rather,
you
said
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
what
the
prosecutor
said
at
the
wesley
trial
and
what
the
prosecutor
said
when
stumpf
made
his
motion
to
vacate.
now,
if
that's
so,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
or
the
lower
courts
have
addressed
that
question
to
determine
whether
they
really
were
inconsistent,
and
if
so,
what
or
why
or
what
difference
it
made.
but
i
haven't
read
the
record
thoroughly,
and
my
impression
might
be
wrong.
so
i'd
appreciate
your
telling
me
what
are
the
facts
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
who
is
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
interested
in
what
defense
counsel
did
or
did
not
say.
i'm
interested
in
what
the
ohio
courts
did
or
did
not
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
my
point
there
is
my...
do
i
repeat
it
or
do
you
have
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
let's
go
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
when
i
read
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
due...
what...
what
am
i
reading,
which
is...
this
is
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
went
on
both
grounds,
first
the
confession...
sorry...
the
guilty
plea,
and
second,
the
inconsistency.
now,
there
i
thought
that
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was...
now,
i
think
i
misspoke
because
i
think
that's
where
i
see
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
understand
what
the
problem
is
or
shall
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
sixth
circuit
seemed
to
be
addressing
the
inconsistency
between
the
sentencing
proceeding
of
stumpf
and
the
wesley
trial.
well,
you
say
the
inconsistency
we
should
focus
upon
is
between
the
wesley
trial
and
the
motion
to
vacate.
and
i
think
you're
right
about
that
because
i
can't
imagine
the
other
being
a
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
relevant
in
terms
of
evidence,
but
i
think
you're
asking
us
to
say
that
there
is
a
due
process
violation
because
of
the
inconsistency
between
what
the
prosecutor
said
at
the
wesley
trial
and
what
the
prosecutor
said
when
stumpf
made
his
motion
to
vacate.
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i'm
asking
you
if
the
sixth
circuit
or
the
ohio
courts
has
addressed
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
read
this.
you
can't
point
to
anything
in
which
they
have
addressed
that
question.
my
quick
reading
of
it...
i
couldn't
find
anything
in
which
they
addressed
that
question.
and
if
that's
so,
what
should
we
do?
