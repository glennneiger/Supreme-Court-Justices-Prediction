justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
i...
i
think
he
was
given
the
death
sentence.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
the
end
of
the
day.
and
there
was
a
separate
sentencing
hearing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
it
argued
at
that
hearing
by
the
state
that
stumpf
was
the
triggerman?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
was
argued.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
there
evidence
at
the
recent
habeas
hearing
that
at
least
one
of
the
sentencers
relied
on
the
fact
that
the
judge
thought
stumpf
was
the
triggerman
and
the
murderer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
my
concern
actually
is
more
with
the
sentencing
proceeding
here,
in
light
of
what's
happened,
than
with
the
guilty
plea.
and
i
suppose
it's
possible
that
that
stands,
but
conceivably
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
the
sentencing
aspect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
he
has
waived
any
due
process
claim
insofar
as
it
applies
to
the
sentencing?
do
you
think
that's
waived?
is
that
clear?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
concede
that
the
evidence
presented
in
the
stumpf
proceeding
was
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
of
guilt
as
an
aider
and
abetter?
was
there
enough
evidence
that
the
fact
finder
could
so
find?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
as
to
that,
it
seems
to
me
the
guilty
plea
can
stand
and
the
only
question
that,
it
seems
to
me,
i
would
have
would
be
with
the
sentencing,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
has
to
be
overturned.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
would
help
to
focus
on
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
address,
on
behalf
of
stumpf,
some
allegation
that
he
has
to
be
resentenced?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
still
before
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
has
that
been
subsumed
somehow?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
wesley
didn't
receive
a
death
sentence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
responded,
stumpf
entered
a
guilty
plea
and
was
sentenced
to
death
for
committing
aggravated
murder
as
part
of
his
armed
robbery
of
a
married
couple
in
ohio.
he
acted
with
an
accomplice.
although,
stumpf
admitted
both
that
he
took
part
in
the
robbery
and
that
he
shot
the
husband
who
happened
to
survive,
stumpf
has
always
claimed
that
his
accomplice
shot
the
wife
who
died.
stumpf's
petition
for
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
denied
by
the
district
court
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
granting
stumpf
relief
on
habeas
corpus
on
two
grounds.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
sixth
circuit's
judgment
in
part,
we
vacate
it
in
part,
and
we
remand
for
further
proceedings.
the
court
of
appeals
first
concluded
that
stumpf's
conviction
was
invalid
because
he
entered
the
guilty
plea
without
knowing
the
elements
of
the
crime
at
issue.
we
reverse
this
portion
of
the
judgment
below
because
we
find
that
stumpf
was
properly
informed
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
at
the
plea
hearing,
stumpf's
attorneys
told
the
court
that
they
had
explained
the
crimes
elements
to
stumpf,
a
representation
that
stumpf
himself
affirmed
on
record.
the
sixth
circuit
thought
that
stumpf
who
has
always
denied
the
killing
of
the
wife,
would
not
have
entered
the
guilty
plea
had
he
known
that
a
conviction
for
aggravated
murder
requires
proof
of
the
defendant's
intent
to
cause
death.
but
stumpf's
conviction
for
aggravated
murder
is
consistent
with
his
claim
that
his
accomplice
in
the
robbery
shot
the
victim.
ohio's
death
penalty
statute
covers
those
who
aid
and
abet
another
person
to
kill
so
long
as
the
aiding
and
abetting
is
itself
done
with
the
intent
to
cause
death,
and
stumpf's
role
in
the
crime
provided
an
adequate
basis
for
finding
the
requirements
met
under
ohio
law.
the
court
of
appeals
also
concluded
that
stumpf's
conviction
and
sentence
could
not
stand
because
the
state
when
it
prosecuted
stumpf's
accomplice
advanced
an
inconsistent
theory
of
the
crime
that
contradicted
the
theory
advanced
by
the
prosecutor
in
stumpf's
own
case.
in
seeking
the
death
penalty
against
stumpf,
the
state
argued
and
the
sentencing
court
agreed
that
stumpf
himself
shot
and
killed
the
wife.
in
prosecuting
stumpf's
accomplice,
however,
the
state
argued
that
stumpf's
accomplice
had
shot
and
killed
the
wife.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
to
interpret
this
inconsistency
as
voiding
stumpf's
guilty
plea
to
the
aggravated
murder
because
as
explained
above,
ohio's
statute
covers
stumpf
regardless
of
which
person
shot
and
killed
the
victim.
the
prosecutor's
arguments
may
have
had
a
more
direct
effect
on
the
death
sentence
given
to
stumpf
however.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
leaves
some
ambiguity
about
the
extent
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
considered
the
sentencing
issue
separate
from
the
conviction
question,
and
the
parties
briefing
to
this
court
focused
on
the
conviction
rather
than
the
sentence.
under
these
circumstances,
we
do
not
make
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
stumpf's
sentencing
claims
at
this
time
instead
we
vacate
this
portion
of
the
judgment
below
and
remand
the
case
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
in
the
first
instance
consider
the
sentencing
claim
independent
of
the
conviction
claim.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
