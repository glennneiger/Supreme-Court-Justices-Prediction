justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the...
the
evidence
was
stumpf...
stumpf
himself
who
said
wesley
was
the
triggerman
with
respect
to
mrs.
stout.
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
a
question
about...
that...
it
relates
to
the
sentencing
part
and
it
follows
up
justice
o'connor's
question.
the...
the...
you...
as...
if
i
understood
you
right,
you
said,
well,
there
was
a
motion
that
came
before
two
of
the
three
judges
that
were
part
of
the
guilty
plea
and
the
sentencing.
this
was
a
plea,
so
no
jury
trial.
it
was
three
judges.
one
of
them
had
died.
the...
the
two
who
remained...
one
of
them
said,
but
if
we
had
not
been
satisfied
that
stumpf
was,
in
fact,
the
triggerman,
and
we
were
satisfied
that
he
was,
in
fact,
an
aider
or
abetter,
that
may
very
well
have
had
an
effect
on
the
court's
determination
whether
the
death
penalty
should
follow.
i'm
not
saying
it
would,
but
it's
possible.
and
then
you
said,
but
then
he
went
ahead
and
voted
to
deny
the
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but
there's
no
explanation
at
all.
the
only
expression
that
we
have
from
that
judge
is...
he
said,
well,
it's
conceivable,
although
it
wouldn't
affect
guilt,
we
would
have
come
out
with
a
different
sentence,
and
then
going
from
that
statement
to
nothing,
just
a
denial
without
explanation.
you...
you
want
us
to
infer
from
that
silent
denial
that
the
judge
must
have
resolved
his
own
difficulty
and
decided
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
on
the
sentence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
be
appropriate
because
the
statute
permits
it.
but
the
decision-maker
has
three
choices.
and
if
the
evidence
had
come
in
that
wesley
was
the
triggerman,
maybe
the...
this
panel
of
judges
would
have
done
what
the
jury
did
in
wesley's
case,
that
is,
it's
the
same
crime,
but
not
give
the
death
penalty
for
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
panel...
the
panel
that
didn't
reopen...
there
was
no
reopening
because
they
denied
the
motion.
but
they
didn't
say
one
way
or
another.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
freedman,
it
wasn't
a
trial.
it
was
a...
it
was
a
plea
hearing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i...
i
thought
the
prosecutor
in
closing
in
the
wesley
trial
said,
it
could
have
been
stumpf,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
they
argued
both?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
introduced
by
wesley,
not
by
the
prosecution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
freedman,
you're
trying
to
read
back
now
into
what
apparently
you
recognize
is...
is
not
a
flawed
initial
sentencing
hearing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
might
be
more
persuasive
if
the
trier
were
a
jury
when
the
motion
to
vacate
is
made,
but
these
are
judges
whose
business
it
is
to
preside
over
these
kinds
of
cases.
they
presided
over
that
first
hearing
and
now
the
same
prosecutor...
was
the
same
prosecutor
in
both?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
comes
back
to
them
and
says,
judges,
don't
vacate
the
sentence
that
you
yourself
entered.
it's...
given
that
we're
dealing
with
sophisticated
judges,
the
same
panel
in
both
episodes,
it's
a
little
hard
to...
to
see
where
the
due
process
violation
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
should...
what...
was
wesley
then
denied
due
process?
because
at
the
time
of
stumpf's
initial
plea
hearing,
eastman
hadn't
appeared
and
there
was
only
stumpf's
testimony
that
he
was
not
the
triggerman
and
the
prosecutor's
evidence
that
he
was.
then
we
get
to
wesley,
and
eastman
shows
up.
the
prosecutors
have
already
taken
the
position
that
stumpf
was
the
triggerman.
is
wesley
denied
due
process
because
they're
taking
inconsistent
positions
at
his
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
your...
your
part
about
the
guilt,
the
sixth
circuit
agreed
with
you
because
it
vacated
not
only
the
sentence,
but
the
conviction.
and
what
is
your
argument
that
the
conviction
is
infirm?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
state
argued
that
knowledge...
there's
this
plan,
and
they
had
a
common
design
to
rob.
is
that
right?
and
then
the
state
said
that
common
design
plus
knowledge
that
an
inherently
dangerous
instrument
would
be
employed
to
perpetuate
the
felony
or
that
the
felony
and
its
manner
of
accomplishment
would
be
reasonably
likely
to
produce
death.
that's
what
the
state
argued
was
the
law
of
ohio.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did...
did
any
judge
say
that,
any
judge
on
the
sixth
circuit
say
that
that
was
the
ohio
law?
