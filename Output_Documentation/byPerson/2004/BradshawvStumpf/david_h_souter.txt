justice
david
h.
souter
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
do
you
argue
that
if
there
is
no
due
process
violation
with
respect
to
the
actual
plea,
there
is,
therefore,
no
due
process
violation
with
respect
to
the
sentence?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
we...
we
may
say
the
theory
really
is...
is
not
sufficiently
relevant
with
respect
to
the
plea
but
that
it
is
with
respect
to
the
sentence.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i...
no
question
about
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i...
i
understand
that.
may
i
go
back
just
to
one
factual
issue
before
we
go
on
and
forget
it?
you...
you
stated,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor,
that
the
state
argued
in...
in
the
stumpf
case
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
find
that
he
was
the
triggerman.
did
the
state
stop
there
and
say,
in
effect,
we
don't
care
whether
you
find
him
the
triggerman
or
not?
we're
just
telling
you
there's
enough
evidence.
i...
i
assumed
the
state
went
on
to
say
there
is
enough
and
you
ought
to
find
that
he
is
the
triggerman.
justice
david
h.
souter
did...
did
the
prosecutor
ever
say
he
was
the
triggerman?
the
evidence
supports
it
and...
and
that's
the
conclusion
that
ought
to
be
drawn:
he
was
the
triggerman.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
did
he
take
the
second
step
and
say
there's
ample
evidence
and
he
was,
in
fact,
the
triggerman
and
you
should
so
find,
or
in
so
many
words?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
is
the
case
that
he
argued
that...
that
you
should
find
him
guilty
because
he
was
the
triggerman.
i
mean,
that
was
an
alternative
argument.
so
the...
i
mean,
i
think
what's
the...
the
concern
following
justice
kennedy's
question,
the
concern
that
i
have
is
not
with
the...
the
guilt
or
innocence
as
such
here.
it's
with
the
sentencing.
and
as...
it
seems
to
me
fair
to
say
that
as
the
record
stands
now,
the
state
has
made
two
arguments:
one
that
stumpf
was
the
triggerman,
one
that
wesley
was
the
triggerman.
it
has
to
be
the
case
that
one
of
those
arguments,
if
accepted,
would
lead
to
a
false
result.
and
the
question...
i
think
the
due
process
question
is
whether
the
state
can
pursue
those
inconsistent
arguments,
even
if
it
starts
out
innocently
doing
it,
but
can
it
pursue
two
inconsistent
arguments
knowing
that
in
one
case
the
argument
must
be
for
a
false
result,
without
there
being
any
kind
of...
of
process
to
correct
the
state's
inconsistent
positions?
what...
i
mean,
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
he
could...
he
could
get
into
court,
but
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
no
recognition
here
that
there
is...
that
there
is
in
fact
something
wrong
with
the
two
inconsistent...
or
the
two
arguments
of
the
state,
each
of
which,
if
accepted,
will
necessarily
result
in
one
false
conclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe...
maybe
that's
enough.
let
me,
with
respect
to
that,
just
ask
you
one
final
question.
and
i'm
assuming
the...
the
answer,
but
i
want
to
be
sure.
i
assume
that
at
the
point
of
this
intermediate
court's
reweighing,
the
intermediate
court
was
aware
of
the...
the
evidence
of...
of...
the
hearsay
evidence
of
wesley's
confession
and
was
aware
that
the
state
argued
in
the
second
case
that
wesley
was
the
triggerman.
am
i
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
i
take
it
also--
justice
david
h.
souter
--stipulated
or
represented
or
admitted,
whatever,
that
in
fact
the
state
had
argued
in
the
second
case
that
wesley
was
the
triggerman.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
of
being...
because
of
being
the
triggerman.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
wait.
who
did
the...
who
was
the
last
person
the
state
pointed
its
finger
at?
you...
you
told
me
in...
in
response
to
earlier
questions
that
when
the
case
back
before
the
two
remaining
members
of
the
panel,
that
in
fact
the
state
brought
the...
called
to
their
attention
the
fact
that
wesley
had
confessed
and...
and
it
was...
it
was
clear
one
way
or
another
that...
that
they
had
argued
in
wesley's
trial
that
he
was
the
triggerman.
when
they...
at
that
point
when
they
are
back
before
the
two
remaining
members
of
the
panel
in
stumpf's
case,
did
the
state
say
we
now
go
back
to
our
original
position
that
stumpf
was
the
triggerman
and
wesley
wasn't,
or
did
they
say
we
think...
we
think
wesley
is
the
triggerman
and
stumpf
wasn't?
or
did
the
state
simply
stand
there
agnostic?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
one
final
question?
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
why
shouldn't
the
state...
after
learning
of
the
supposed
admission
in
wesley,
after
taking
wesley's
position,
why
shouldn't
the
state,
when
it
gets
back
to
the
stumpf
case
before
the
remaining
two
members
of
the
panel,
have
to
fish
or
cut
bait
on
a
position
and
say
we
think
he's
the
triggerman
and
we
want
you
to
affirm
on
that
basis,
or
we
don't
think
he
was
the
triggerman
because
we've
taken
this
other
position?
why
can
the
state,
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
stand
there
agnostic?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
didn't
have
to
take
it
as
true.
as
i
understand
it,
when
they
went
back
before
the...
the
two
original
judges
on
the
motion
to
vacate,
they
didn't
have
to
take
the...
the
testimony
about
the
jailhouse
admission
as
true,
and
they
didn't
have
to
take
the
state's
position
at
the
wesley
trial
as
true.
it
was
evidence.
it
was
before
them.
they
were
in...
they
were
required
to
consider
it.
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
state
at
that
point
essentially
was...
was
agnostic.
the
state
said,
you
know,
this
is
what
happened,
this
is
what
we
said,
this
is
what
the
jury
did
in
the
second
trial,
but
regardless
of
how
you
determine...
of...
of
any
determination
about
triggerman,
this
man
stumpf
still
deserves
death,
so
don't
vacate
the
sentence.
and...
and
there
was
nothing
i
guess...
number
one,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
at
that
point
a...
a
problem
with
the
state
taking
inconsistent
positions,
i.e.,
with
its
position
in...
in
the...
in
the
wesley
case,
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any...
any
lack
of
candor.
there
may
be
a...
a
lack
of
initiative
on
the
state's
part
to
fish
or
cut
bait,
but
there's
no
lack
of
candor.
so
where
does
the
due
process
violation
come
at
that
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it...
i
mean,
that...
that
statement
is
true,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
freedman,
you've...
you've
argued
just
a
second
ago
that
both
of
the
appellate
courts
decided
the
case
or
went
through
so-called
reweighing
on
a
false
premise
that
he
had
pleaded
guilty
to
being
the
shooter.
let
me
go
back
to
the...
to
the
two
remaining
members
of
the
original
trial
panel.
i
take
it
they
did
not
make
that...
in
your
judgment
that
error.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
what
your
position
would
be
if
a
hypothetical
justice
kennedy
suggested
earlier
in
the
argument
were
true.
what
if
the
state
had
gone
back
at
the...
at
the
hearing
before
the
original
two
in
response
to
the
motion
to
vacate
and
had
said,
we
did
argue
in
the
wesley
case
that
he
was
the
triggerman?
the
jury
rejected
that
argument.
they
found
that...
that
he
was
not.
we've...
we've
learned
from...
from
our
own
experience
and...
and
we
now
no
longer
think
that...
that
the
evidence
from
the
jailhouse
informant
should
be
accepted.
we're
back
to
the
position
that
we
took
in
the...
at
the
stumpf
sentencing
hearing
originally,
that...
that
he
was
the
triggerman.
if
the
state
had
taken
that
position,
would
you
have
a
due
process
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm...
i'm
not
getting
it.
what
do
you
mean?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
can't
they...
can't
they
profit
from
the
jury's
verdict?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
he
didn't
receive
the...
the
death
penalty.
what
would
his
argument
be
with
respect
to
guilt
or
innocence?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
only
goes
to
penalty.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
stumpf's
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
so
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
don't
see
where
wesley--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so...
so
wesley
would
have
neither
a...
a
due
process
claim
with
respect
to
sentence
nor
with
respect
to
guilt.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
thought
the...
the
specific
intent
element
would
be
satisfied
if...
if
they,
by
plan,
went
to
the
scene
with...
with
deadly
weapons.
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
mean
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
vacate.
