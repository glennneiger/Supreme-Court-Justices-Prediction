but,
general
cole,
isn't
there
a
distinction
between
eligibility
for
the
death
penalty
and
actually
making
the
decision
to
impose
the
death
penalty?
and
it's
perfectly
clear...
you're
dead
right,
of
course.
he's
eligible
under
either
theory.
but
is
it
not
likely
that
the
sentencer
would
be
more
likely
to
sentence
the
defendant
to
death
if
the
sentencer
thought
he
had
been
the
actual
shooter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
and
the
original
sentencer
might...
might
not
have
done
the
same
thing.
we
don't
really
know
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
state's
position
was
that
the
jailhouse
informant
had
told
the
truth,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
at
least
put
in
the
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
normally
you
don't
put
in
evidence
unless
you
think
it
will
support
a
proposition
that
you...
that
you're
in
favor
of.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
jury
simply
decided
they
didn't
want
to
sentence
two
people
to
death
for
the
same
offense.
