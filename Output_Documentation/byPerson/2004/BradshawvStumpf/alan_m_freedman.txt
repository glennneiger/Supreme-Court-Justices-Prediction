mr.
alan
m.
freedman
in
light
of
the
questioning,
i'd
like
to
indicate
what
exactly
was
argued
below
and
what
was
the
rulings.
in...
in
the
first
stumpf
trial,
they...
they
argued
that
there
was,
quote/unquote,
ample
evidence
to
point--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--the
prosecutors.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
prosecutors
argued
that
there
was
ample
evidence,
quote/unquote,
pointed--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--that's
correct,
but
there
was...
but...
but
in
ohio
there's
a
requirement
to
have
an
actual
prove-up
of
the
aggravating
factor
itself.
and
they
argued
that
there
was
ample
evidence,
quote/unquote,
pointed
to
stumpf
as
the
killer,
and
that's
in
joint
appendix
186
to
187.
ultimately
they...
and
they
urged
that
he
was
the
shooter.
then
when
the
wesley
trial
took
place,
at
the
trial
they
did
the
same
thing.
they
used
the
same
terms,
quote/unquote,
ample
evidence
that
wesley
was
the
shooter.
they
urged
a
finding
that
wesley
was...
was
the
shooter.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
they--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--that...
they
really
didn't
argue
both.
they...
they...
effect...
that
was
the
throwaway
argument.
they
came
in
there...
what...
what
i
think
is
critical
in
both
trials
and
later
on
in
the
proceedings
is
what
they
were
urging,
what
they
were
recommending
the...
to
the
jury.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
but
the...
but
they
urged.
they
recommended.
they
didn't
come
in
and
say...
and
throughout
this
proceeding...
we
don't
know
who
the
shooter
is.
we
don't
care
who
the
shooter
is.
they
both
deserve
the
death
penalty.
they...
they
were...
the
prosecutors
were
aware
that
the...
the
death
penalty
is
what
stirs
the
pot
here,
and
so
they
were
urging
somebody
to
be
the
shooter
to
get
the
death
penalty.
if
this
wasn't
a
death
penalty
case,
i
don't
think
they...
it
would
have
mattered
who
killed
who.
and
so
they
were
urging--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--but...
but
they
took
the
position
of
actually
urging,
making
a
recommendation.
i...
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
due
process
violation
if
they
said,
we
don't
know.
they
didn't
take
that.
they...
they
urged
a
position,
and
i
think
that's
the
key
factor
when
the...
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
the
due
process
violation,
your
honor,
would
be--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--no,
of
course,
there
wasn't
in
the
first
trial.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
we
submit
that
the
due
process
error
is
at
the
motion
to
vacate.
at
that
time,
again,
after
taking
the
position
that
wesley
was
the
shooter,
they
came
back
and
urged
that...
that
stumpf
was
the
shooter,
that
the
record
was
ample
enough
to
support
stumpf
being
the
shooter--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--because
they've
taken
inconsistent
positions.
the...
the
violation
here
is
in
the
positions
itself,
not
in
necessarily
the
results.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
i
think
they
did
more
than
it
didn't...
it
just
didn't
matter.
i
think
they
urged
the
position.
it
would...
i
mean,
a
lot
of
the
cases
in
the
lower
courts
have
made
that
distinction
when
the...
when
the
state
comes
in
and
says,
we
don't
know
what
happens.
we
can't
tell
you
who
the
shooter
is
or
not,
and
we
don't
care
who
the
shooter
is.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
it's
different,
but
that's
not
what
happened.
it's
different
if
they've
taken...
if
they've
taken
the
position--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--i...
i
put
it
that
it's
not
the
same
because
they...
first
of
all,
in
reality,
that's
not
what
they
did.
but
let's
talk
in
terms
of
the
hypothetical
that...
that
you've
asked
me.
it
is
that
you
have
to
also
look
at
what
actually
happened
in
the
wesley
trial
to
determine
due
process
for
stumpf
because
wesley...
what
happened
in
this
case
through
the
whole
circular
reasoning,
wesley
didn't
get
the
death
penalty
here
because
they
were
informed
that
stumpf
pled
guilty,
was
found
to
be
the
principal
offender,
and
was
sentenced
to
death.
now--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--that's
correct.
the
prosecution
in
the
wesley
trial
originally
did
not
want
the...
the
jury
to
hear
at
all
what
happened
in
stumpf's
trial.
they
wanted
to
argue
the
complete...
that...
that
stumpf's
verdict
was
not
even...
should
be
informed.
the
sentence
of
death
shouldn't
be
informed
or
the
sentence
of
death.
and
in
fact,
that's
when
they
started
to
throw
in
a
little
bit
of
the
alternative
theory
after
that
evidence
did
subsequently
get
in.
the
record
shows
that
they
originally
did
not
get
it
in
and
they
allowed
the
defense
counsel...
prevented
defense
from
getting...
in
the
wesley
trial
from
getting
in
the
evidence
of
the
stumpf
trial.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
the
due
process
violation
is
that
at
the
minimum,
assuming
that...
that
a
weighing
is
even
appropriate
here,
they
never
weighed
it,
and
clearly
any
indication
that
there
was
a
waiver...
a...
a
weighing
of
whether
mr.
stumpf
would
be
put
to
death
as
an
aider
and
abetter.
they
never
took
eastman's
testimony
as
true
and...
and
the
prosecution's
position
as
true,
and
then
ultimately
said
it
would
make
no
difference.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
we
submit
the
due
process
violation
comes
at
the
time
of
the
motion
to
vacate.
we
urge...
we're
urging
that
they've
not
take
an
agnostic
position
as
prosecutors.
they're...
they're
urging
again
saying
the...
the
evidence
is
ample
to
support
that...
that
stumpf
was...
was
the
shooter.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
but...
but
they're
also
urging
a
position.
the
state
at
some
point
should
take
a
position
on
what
the
evidence
is.
at
that
position...
at
that
point,
after
urging
that
mr.
wesley
is
the
shooter,
they...
were
they
untrue?
were
they...
i
mean,
the
prosecutors
at
that
point
maybe
then...
if
they
were
believing
that...
that
eastman
was
testifying
truthfully,
why
wouldn't
they
now
believe
that
he
was
testifying
truthfully
now
in
the
motion
to
vacate?
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
we...
we
proffer
to
the
court
that
they
shouldn't
be
taking
inconsistent
positions
as
to...
in
a
death
penalty
case
in
the
sentencing--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--i...
i
don't
believe
that
wesley
was
denied
due
process.
they
discovered
the
evidence
afterwards
and
ultimately
at
that
trial
they
had...
the
wesley
jury
had
the
opportunity
to
hear
what
happened
in
the
stumpf
trial,
and
they
were
able
to
weigh
that
case
along
with
the
evidence
of
the
stumpf
finding
and
sentence
of
death
and
the
finding
that
he
was
the
principal
offender.
that's
something
we
submit
has
not
happened
in
this
death
penalty
case.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
without
the
wesley
evidence,
i...
i...
at
the
initial
trial,
i
certainly
would
concede
that.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
as...
as
to...
as
to
whether
the
evidence
that
you
learn
from
the
wesley
trial...
that's
a
much
closer
question
because
the...
the
aggravating
factor
in
this
case--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--okay,
all
right.
i'm
just...
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
well--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--i--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--that's
correct,
and
that's
what
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--that...
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
no.
that's
before
you.
in
fact,
there's
a...
there's
a
question
of
whether
they
even
challenge
that.
but
clearly,
that
the
sentence
by
the
sixth...
the
sentence
was
challenged
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
found
to
be
defective
and
a
violation
of
due...
of
due
process,
and
that's
in
the
cert--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--well...
well,
i'd
like
to
ask...
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first,
the...
we
would
submit
that
a
reweighing
isn't
necessary.
this
is
not
like
vacating
an
aggravating
factor.
this
is
determining
a
constitutional
error
of
due
process.
but
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
reweighing
is...
is
adequate.
there
was
no
reweighing,
proper
reweighing,
in
either
the
appellate
court
or
the
ohio
supreme
court.
the...
the
appellate
court,
which
is
the
intermediate
court
in
ohio,
came
out
and
said
both
wesley
and
stumpf
were
principal
slayers
as
if
they
were
both
shooters.
and
the
whole
opinion
is
hinged
on
the
assumption
that
mr.
stumpf
pled
guilty
to
being
the
shooter.
if
you...
i
mean,
that's...
we
submit
that's
just
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion.
and
also,
if
you
go
to
their
main
opinion,
which
is
the
final
opinion,
which
this
court
reviews,
the
ohio
supreme
court...
they
did
the
same
circular
reasoning.
ultimately
they
said
he
pled
guilty.
he
was
the
shooter,
and
therefore,
eastman's
testimony
will
have
little
weight
as
hearsay
to...
to
vacate
the
death
sentence.
they
never
independently
weighed
the
case
saying,
let's
take
eastman
as
true,
let's
look
at
this
case
as
an
aider
and
abetter--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--the
best
case
we
cite
in
our
brief
is
green
v.
georgia.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
green
v.
georgia
where
they
came
in
with
inconsistent
positions.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
in
all
candor,
i
don't
know.
there's
no
finding.
they
simply
said
denied.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
on...
on
this...
on
this
record,
we
would
have
a
due
process
claim
for
twofold.
we
submit
that
the...
that
the
error
is
in
the
attempt
not
necessarily
the
success,
and
particularly
in
the--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--i
mean...
i
mean,
it's...
it's
that
they
honestly
believed
that
wesley...
that
in
the
wesley
trial,
that
eastman
testified
truthfully.
they
believed
that.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
perhaps,
but
not
in
this
particular
case
because
what
the
jury
weighed
in
wesley
was
not
only
eastman's
testimony,
they
weighed
the
fact
that
stumpf
pled
guilty,
was
found
to
be
the
principal
offender,
and
was
sentenced
to
death.
that's
a...
i
mean,
that's
going
to
lead
to...
i...
i...
maybe
i'm
off
base
here,
but
that's
going
to
lead
a
jury
to
come
out
in
a
conclusion
to
find
wesley
the
aider
and
abetter
and
not--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--right.
i
mean,
they
already
had
the
principal
offender.
they
already
had
somebody
sentenced
to
death
for
it.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
they...
they
argued
generally
in...
in
the
record,
and
it
was...
it
was
somewhat
cryptic.
they
argued
that
it
was
unfair--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--i'm
sorry.
i
apologize.
the...
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
thank
you.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
i
have
it
now,
yes.
the...
the
ohio...
the
ohio
supreme
court
simply...
simply
used...
simply
used
some
sort
of
circular
reasoning.
they...
they
hung
to
the
position
that
stumpf
was
the
shooter,
and
then
after
that--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--okay.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
okay.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
yes,
i
see
it.
you
want
to
know
somewhere
in
the
sixth
circuit
opinion?
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
i...
i...
maybe
i
should
clarify.
i...
i
think
that
you
have
to
compare
the
wesley
trial
with
the
stumpf
trial.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
i'm
uncertain.
i...
i
think
they
did
it
in
a
generic
fashion.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
well,
as
an...
as
an
alternative,
the
court
could
remand
back
to
have
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--with
absolute
certainty,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
because
they
asked
the
same
questions.
they
asked
where
did
the
error
occur,
and
that
the
line
of
the
questionings
were
almost...
on
that
point
was
identical.
they
asked
questions
where
did
the
error
come,
and
of
course,
it
wasn't
in
the
first
trial.
the
error
occurred
at
the
motion
to
vacate.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
well,
he
certainly
wouldn't
have
the
death
sentence.
that
was...
is
solely
as
to
the
guilt
part
of
the
case,
justice
scalia?
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
he
might.
he
might
because
the...
the...
i
mean--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--well,
in
all
due
respect,
only
one
has
the
sentence--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--not...
not
as
to
the
death...
not
as
to...
not
as
to
the
death
sentence,
no.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
why?
one,
he
didn't...
let's
assume
arguendo
that
he
received
the
death
sentence.
he
had
an
opportunity--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--no,
he
did
not.
that's
what...
but
you--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--there's
still
an
issue
out
there
because
this
is
killing
a
witness.
as...
he
would
have
a
tougher
role.
i
don't
think
wesley
would...
would
have
much
of
a
chance.
the...
the
version
of
mr.
stumpf's
facts,
whether
it's
a
difficult
row
to
hoe
is
that
he...
he
drops
the
gun.
that
was
one
of
the...
and...
and
shortly
leaves
the
scene
after
that.
so
that
he...
there's
no
intent,
notwithstanding
justice
scalia's
position
that
you...
attempt
to
shoot
mr.
stout,
that
he's
automatically...
the
specific
intent
is
inferred.
but
it's
not
absolutely
clear,
leaving
the
scene,
that
the
intent
could
be
inferred
to
kill
another
witness.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
so
i'm
saying
that
he
would
not--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--no,
wesley
would
not
have...
wesley
would
not
have
that
scenario
under--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
and...
and
what
they...
they
deduced
from
that
is
that
the...
the
evidence
of
the
wesley
trial...
their
position
is
that...
and
the
position
that...
that
the
prosecutor
took
and
the
evidence
that
eastman
took,
that
there
would
be
no
specific
intent
as
to
the
killing
of...
of
mary
jane
stout
inferred
from
the
shooting
of
norman
stout
because
he
dropped
the
gun.
i
mean,
you
don't...
but
there's
no...
in...
in
ohio
a
plan
is
required.
there's
no
foreseeability
or
reckless
disregard
for
the
death...
for
the
eligibility
for
the
death
penalty.
it's
one
of
the
few
states.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
i
believe
under
ohio
law
that
that's
not
correct.
i
mean,
it's
one
of
the
few
states.
and
i
believe
even
the
cases
that
are
cited
by
the
state
would
infer
that.
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
but
i...
i
believe
that
they
needed
a
plan
for...
for
the
killing
of
a
witness.
they
needed
that
plan
at
the
time
for
killing
the
witness.
it's
not
enough
just
to
plan
the
robbery
for
the
specific
intent.
and...
and
they...
in
the
wesley
trial,
i
want
to
refer
you
to
page--
mr.
alan
m.
freedman
--i
believe
so.
that's
my
reading
of
the
sixth
circuit
opinion.
they
said
that
there
was
an
element
of...
of
intent
that
was...
i
believe
that's
the...
the
way
i
interpret
the
holding.
i
would
like
to
refer
you
just
to
page
295
of
the
joint
appendix,
even
the
last
sentence
or
so
in
the
first
paragraph.
they
imply
that
in
the
wesley
trial,
talking
about
the
same
scenario,
that
there's
not
necessarily
a
plan
coming
in
to
kill
the
witnesses.
there
would
have
to
be
a
plan
while
they're
in
the
house.
and...
and
the
scenario
of
mr.
stumpf
dropping
the
gun
i
believe
is
arguably
that
there's
no
specific
intent.
i...
i
would
just
like
to
sum
up
and
indicate
that...
that
the
state
argued
in
both
cases
urging
the
death
of
two
individuals
based
on
killing
the
same
person,
and
ultimately
there
was
not
adequate
review
in
mr.
stumpf's
case
indicating
that
he
would
have
gotten
the
death
penalty
notwithstanding
eastman's
testimony,
notwithstanding
their
position
that
he
would
have
gotten
the
death
penalty
as
an
aider
and
abetter,
which
is
a
rather
rare
circumstance
not
only
in
ohio
but
also
in
this
country.
