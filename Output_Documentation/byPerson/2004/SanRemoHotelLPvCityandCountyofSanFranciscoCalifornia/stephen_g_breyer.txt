justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is
the
claim
you
want
to
make?
that
is,
my
reading
of
the
california
state
court
opinion
says
you
came
into
their
court
and
you
said,
look,
this
ordinance
in
san
francisco
violates
the
fifth
amendment,
i
guess,
because
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
the...
there's
no
good
basis,
no
sound
basis
for
requiring
us
to
pay
a
fee
in
order
to
convert
rooms.
anyway,
the
room
isn't
a
house.
anyway,
it
makes
no
sense
as
applied
to
us.
anyway,
they
admit
they
just
want
to
raise
revenue.
anyway,
we're
going
to
give
the
tenant
a
place
to
live
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
all
right.
those
were
the
claims.
and
in
each
case,
the
california
supreme
court
said
you're
wrong.
you're
wrong
because
it
does
help
preserve
rooms,
because
it
does
have
a
reasonable
purpose
in
a
city
that's
crowded,
because
the
tenant
who's
there
for
life
might
move
out,
and
we
want
to
keep
the
room
even
if
he
moves
out
because
he
dies.
and
anyway,
it's
not
an
issue
of
whether
your
case
is
special.
this
makes
sense
as
a
general
rule.
all
right?
they
decided
it.
you
raised
it.
now,
what
else
is
it
you
want
to
raise
in
federal
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
if
you
said
it.
i
just
said
that
that
is
what
i
read
in
the
california
supreme
court
opinion
that
justice
werdegar
wrote.
and
so
what
i'm
asking
you
is
whether
they
should
have
or
whether
they
shouldn't
have,
they
did
seem
to
decide
those
five
issues.
and
so
my
question
to
you
is,
what
else
do
you
want
to
raise?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
decided
a
different
thing.
i
thought
that
it
decided
that
in
part
that
was
the
reason
for
their
decision.
but
the
reason
they
reached
their
decision
is
they
thought
on
each
of
those
five
matters
that
the
city
of
san
francisco
had
a
reasonable
legislative
purpose
for
its
ordinance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
as,
suppose,
for
example,
they
had
decided
that
the
hotel
clerk
or
the
temporary
manager
did
speak
english,
and
in
fact,
he
was
a
scholar
of
english.
and
suppose
that
that
had
been
the
key
matter
for
its
decision
of
state
law.
i
take
it,
if
you
came
into
federal
court,
even
if
the
issue
were
quite
different,
you
would
be
bound
by
that
factual
determination.
that's
why
i'm
asking
you.
it
seems
to
me
here
they
have
decided
matters
of
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
purpose
or
not
for
this
particular
ordinance
and
as
applied
to
you.
now,
what
else
do
you
want
to
raise
in
federal
court
that
was
not
encompassed
by
what
i
just
described?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
am
i
right?
i'm
just
trying
to
narrow
the
issue
in
my
mind.
am
i
right
you
want
to
raise
one,
two,
three,
four,
or
five
of
those
issues
that
i
just
described
and
nothing
more?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
about
that?
