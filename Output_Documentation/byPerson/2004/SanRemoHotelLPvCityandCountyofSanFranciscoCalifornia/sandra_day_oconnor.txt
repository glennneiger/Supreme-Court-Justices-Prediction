justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
are
your...
exactly
what
claims
are...
is
your
client
now
raising
in
federal
court?
i
mean,
we
don't
take
a
case
to
just
decide
if
something
is
unfair.
what
are
the
precise
claims
your
client
is
raising
now
in
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
somehow
thought
that
your
question
had
boiled
down
to
whether
there
was
issue
preclusion
here.
am
i
wrong?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
talking
about
the
issues
in
this
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
was
this
court's
decision
in
the
williamson
county
case
that
led
you
and
i
assume
other
lawyers
in
these
takings
cases
to
return
to
state
court
and
try
to
litigate
everything.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
haven't
asked
us
to
revisit
that
williamson
county
case,
have
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
you
should
have.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
isn't--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
isn't
clear
from
williamson
county
that
this
court
envisioned
two...
two
separate
determinations
of
fact
issues:
one
in
state
court
and
one
in
federal.
that
isn't
clear
from
the
face
of
williamson
county.
that
was
a
case
where
it
was
thought,
at
least,
by
members
of
the
court
that
the
claims
in
that
case
just
weren't
ripe
yet.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
don't...
i
didn't
understand
it
to
set
up
parallel
systems
of
factual
determinations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
england
was
an
abstention
case
and
had
to
deal
with
the
effect
of
28
u.s.
code
1738,
the
full
faith
and
credit
act.
but
i
didn't
think
that
the
england
case
just
totally
destroyed
the
notion
of
full
faith
and
credit--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as...
as
applied
section
1738.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
not
a...
a
pullman
abstention
case
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it's
open
to
us
to
reconsider
aspects
of
williamson
county
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it...
frankly,
it
isn't
clear
to
me
that
the
court
ever
contemplated
just
cutting
off
any
determination
in
federal
court
of
takings
claims
in
the
way
that
it
seems
to
work
out
by
application
of
williamson
county.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
clear
we
didn't.
so
now
we're
faced
with
the
consequences
of
that,
and
it
looks
to
me
like
the
lower
courts
have
run
pretty
far
with
williamson
county.
so
what's
a
takings
claimant
supposed
to
do?
