are
you
bound
by
a
finding
in
the

there
no
such

was
the...
was
the
ninth
circuit
wrong
in
indicating
that
there
was
no
exaction?
that's
the
way
i
read
its
opinion.

but...
but
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
think
that
dolan
doesn't
apply,
and
i
take
it
that
you
would

there
precedent
that
what
is
reasonable
for
the
state
constitution
is
always
reasonable
for
the
federal
constitution?

well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
so
much
that

that
the

the

and
a

agencies
here
were
just
so
complex
that
it
amounted
to
