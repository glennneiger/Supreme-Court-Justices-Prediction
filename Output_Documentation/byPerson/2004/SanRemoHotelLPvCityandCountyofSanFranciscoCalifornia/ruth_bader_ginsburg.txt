is
it
your
position
that
issue
preclusion
doesn't
apply
at
all,
or
that
there
was
no
issue
decided
in
the
state
court
proceeding
that
carries
over
into
the
federal
proceeding?
which
one
is
it?
what...
you
suggested...
you
said,
number
one,
no
facts
were
found.
the
question
was
whether
there
was
sufficient
statements
to
survive
a
12(b)(6)
or
its
counterpart
dismissal
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
it
did...
if
it
did
apply,
what
issues
would
be
precluded?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
utrecht,
if
i
understand
the
respondents'
brief
correctly,
there
is
on
pages
10
and
11
a
whole
list
of
issues
that
they
say
were
determined...
raised,
litigated,
and
determined
in
the
state
court.
so,
for
example,
that
the
hco's
housing
replacement
fees
bear
a
reasonable
relationship
to
loss
of
housing,
the
use
of
a
defined
historical
measure...
measurement
point
reasonably
related
to
the
hco's...
and
it
goes
on
for
a
paragraph,
citing
issues
that
respondents
say
that
were
raised,
litigated,
and
decided
in
the
california
supreme
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
isn't
there
an
essential
step
to
find
out
that
there
were
issues?
because
i
think
the
way
you're
phrasing
the
question,
it
says,
if
there
were
issues
decided,
they
weren't
precluded.
but
if
there
are
no
issues,
that's...
that's
not
what's
involved
in
this
case.
the
simplest
ground
on
which
you
could
knock
out
issue
preclusion
is
that
no
issues
were
decided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
were
the
issues
that
the
ninth
circuit
thought
were
decided?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
issue
preclusion
does
extend
to
questions
of
law,
as
well
as
fact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
said
there
was
no
litigation
because
it
was
just
decided.
they
didn't
plead
enough
to
state
a
claim
for
relief.
