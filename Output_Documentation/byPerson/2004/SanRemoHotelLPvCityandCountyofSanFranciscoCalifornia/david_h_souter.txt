justice
david
h.
souter
well,
as
i
understand,
i...
i
would...
i
will
grant
you
that
there
are
moments
in
the...
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
which
there
seems
to
be
a
shift
back
and
forth
in
the
rhetoric
between
claim
preclusion
and
issue
preclusion.
but
as
i
understand
what
the
ninth
circuit
held,
it
did
not
hold
that
your
claim
was
necessarily
out
of
court
because
of
claim
preclusion.
it
held
that
your
claim
failed
because
of
the
effect
of
issue
preclusion
on
elements
that
were
common,
factual
elements
common
to
both
the
claim
in
the
state
court
and
the
claim
that
you
sought
to
bring
in
the
federal
court.
am...
am
i
correct
about
that,
about
what
the
ninth
circuit
held?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
in
effect,
then
maybe...
are
you
saying
this,
that
there
is
no
issue
preclusion
here
because
the...
the
ruling
that
there
was
no
statement
of
a
cause
of
action
was,
in
fact,
a
disposition
of
the
claim
without
there
being
any
resolution
of
any
fact
issue
upon
which
the
claim
might
depend.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
and
therefore...
and...
and
that
is
the
reason
why
there
is
no
issue
preclusion?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
take
a...
may
i...
may
i,
in
effect,
approach
it
with
a
simpler
example,
which...
which
is
not
this
case,
but
i...
i
just
want
to
know
how...
how
the...
the
systems
work
together.
let's
assume
that,
in
fact,
a...
a
lucas
kind
of
claim
had
been
involved,
and
the...
the
state
courts
said
we
understand
lucas.
we're
applying
lucas.
and
in
point
of
fact,
following
the
lucas
standard,
there
are
plenty
of
uses
that
are
still
left
on
this
land,
so
that
there's
no
taking
under...
under
lucas.
and
let's
assume
that
they...
they
go
through
the
state
system.
they
lose.
they
don't
petition
here
for
cert.
instead,
they
go
into
the...
the
district
court
with
a
fifth
amendment
claim.
is
it
open
to
them
in
the
district
court
to
make
this
argument?
don't
apply
issue
preclusion
to
our
lucas
claim.
the
lucas...
to...
to
the...
to
the
determinations,
the
reasonable
use
determination
in...
in
lucas.
don't
do
it
because
although
the
state
court
purported
to
be
applying
lucas,
it
really
was
not.
it
was
not
following
the
lucas
standard.
it
was
applying
something
much
more
favorable
to
the
state.
and
therefore,
any
determination
on
that
issue
should
not
get
preclusion
here.
we
ought
to
be
able
to
litigate
de
novo
even
though,
on
the
face
of
it,
we
seemed
to
have
litigated
the
lucas
issue
and
the
state
court
decided
it.
could
they
make
that
argument?
and...
and
if
it
were
sound,
would...
would
preclusion
principles
give
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
in
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--decided
but
not
litigated.
i
mean,
the...
the
problem
is
that...
that
claim
preclusion
normally
assumes
that
the
issue
is,
in
fact,
litigated.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
his...
he's
arguing
it
was
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
tell
me
how
that
statement
that
you
just
made,
fully
litigated,
squares
with
the
fact
that...
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
it
was
decided
on
a
demurrer.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm...
i'm
confused
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're...
you're
saying
that
the
facts
were...
were
independently
developed
before
the
demurrer
was
filed
and
granted?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
was
not
decided
simply
on
pleadings.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
