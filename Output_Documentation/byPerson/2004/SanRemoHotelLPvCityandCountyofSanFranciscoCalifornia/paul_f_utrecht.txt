mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
this
case
should
be
reversed
for
three
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
the
result
is
unfair
and
the
rationale
of
the
court
is
unfair.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
my
client
is
making
a
facial
and
as-applied
takings
challenge
to
both
the
hotel
conversion
ordinance
and
the
regulatory
scheme
of
which
it
is
a
part.
and
that
claim...
that
federal--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
there's
issue
preclusion--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--okay.
the
issue
in
this
court
is
whether
the
federal
takings
claim
should
be
precluded
under
issue
preclusion
by
a
state
court
judgment
that
did
not
decide
the
federal
takings
claim
and
could
not
have
decided
the
federal
takings
claim.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
the
ninth
circuit
did
limit
its
holding
to
issue
preclusion.
it
did
not
rule
on
claim
preclusion.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
the
other
part
of
your
question
about
whether
it
was
based
on
factual
determinations
could
not
have
been
based
on
factual
determinations.
instead,
it
was
based
on
the
prior
state
court
determination
that
we
did
not
state
a
claim...
state
a
cause
of
action
under
california
law
for
state
compensation.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
because
of
that,
we
have
never
had
an
opportunity
to
have
our
federal
takings
claim
decided
on
the
merits.
we
believe
that
that
undermines
the
federal
courts'
primacy
in
deciding
federal
questions,
particularly
federal
constitutional
questions.
we
also
believe--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--this
court
in
williamson
county
said
that
before
you
could
bring
a
federal
takings
claim,
you
had
to
go
to
state
court
and
seek
compensation
under
state
law.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
we
have
not
asked
that
this
court
reconsider
the
decision
in
williamson
county.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
well,
at
this
point
i
don't
think
that
we
can.
perhaps
we
could
have
in
1998
when
the
ninth
circuit
applied
the
williamson
county
case
and
ordered
us
to
go
to
state
court
with
our
unripe
federal
claims,
unripe
under
this
court's
holding
in
williamson.
but
i
think
that
at
this
point
the
question
before
the
court
is
given
that
we've
complied
with
the
procedural
requirements
that
this
court
established
in
williamson
county,
are
we
now
precluded
by
issue
preclusion
in
the
second
litigation
that
this
court
ordered
because
of
the
state
court
compensation
ruling.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
this
court
established
in
williamson
county
is
a
two
separate
litigation
scheme.
the
first
litigation
concerns
state
compensation,
and
the
second
litigation
concerns
the
federal
takings
claim.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
that's
correct.
i
think
that
the
second
circuit
got
this
issue
correct
in
the
santini
case
when
it
concluded
that
whether
you
started
in
federal
court
and
were
ordered
to
proceed
to
state
court
under
williamson
county
or
you
looked
at
the
williamson
county
case
and
said,
i'm
going
to
start
in
state
court
because
that's
what
williamson
county
says
that
i'm
required
to
do,
it
doesn't
matter.
it
shouldn't
matter
for
purposes
of
issue
preclusion
on
the
federal
takings
claim
once
it
has
been
made
ripe
under
the
procedures
required
by
williamson
county.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
our...
our
primary
position
is
that
issue
preclusion
does
not
apply
for
the
same
reasons
that
this
court
found
that
issue
preclusion
did
not
apply
in
england
when
you
were
required
to
do
two
separate
litigations.
the
question
of
whether
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
applied
issue
preclusion
law...
we
also
raise
that
as
our
last
argument
in
our
opening
brief,
but
our
primary
argument
here
today
is
that
issue
preclusion
should
not
apply
at
all
to
federal--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--in
our
position
no
issue
should
be
precluded
because
under
california
law,
which
the
ninth
circuit
was
obligated
to
apply,
only
identical
issues
that
are
resolved
under
a
different
set
of
laws
can
be
precluded
in
the
second
proceeding,
and
there
was
no
identical
issue
finding
by
the
ninth
circuit.
instead,
the
ninth
circuit
applied
its
equivalent
determination
finding.
but
i
think
that
the...
the
real
issue
before
this
court
is
not
the
california
preclusion
law
question,
but
the
real
issue
is
whether
this
court's
decision
in
england
should...
or
the
rationale
of
this
court's
decision
in
england
should
be
applied
to
the
very
similar
circumstances
raised
by--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
i
don't
believe
there
was
such
a
finding.
i
think
that
the
california
supreme
court
decided
that
the
exaction
met
the
state
law
compensation
requirements
and
did
not--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--i...
i
don't
read
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
as
saying
there
was
no
exaction.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
exaction
was
imposed
by
legislation
rather
than
by
an
administrative
proceeding,
and
because
of
that,
it
was
subject
to
a
different
standard
than
exactions
imposed
in
administrative
proceedings.
but
i
think
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
an...
an
exaction
was
imposed
and
was
actually
paid.
this
is
not
a...
this
is
not
a
case
where
there's
an
issue
about
whether
the
exaction
was
imposed.
the
issues
were
what
standard
was
used
to
review
that
exaction
and
whether
the
exaction
was
constitutional.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
well,
i
think
this
court
has
not
decided
whether
exactions
imposed
by
legislation
are
treated
differently
than
exactions
imposed
by
administrative
proceedings.
the
state
court
in
this
case
determined
that
under
state
compensation
law
that
mattered.
but
this
court
has
not
decided
that.
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
indicate
that
it
was
in
general
agreement
with
the
california
supreme
court,
but
again,
because
it
didn't
actually
decide
the
merits,
it
just
decided
that
there
was
an
equivalent
determination
under
state
law,
it
didn't
get
to
the
final
question
of
whether
this
was
an
exaction
and
what
the
proper
standard
was.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
i
did
want
this
court
to
get
to
that
question,
but
when
this
court
rejected
question
2,
i
think
this
court
decided
that
it
did
not
want
to
get
to
that
question.
but
we...
and
we
did
not
brief
that
question
because
this
court
did
not
grant
certiorari
on
question
number
2.
but
we
definitely
did
want
this
court
to
decide
that
question,
and
obviously,
if...
since
the
court
can't
decide
it
in
this
case,
we
would,
obviously,
want
the
court
to
decide
it
in
some
other
case,
hopefully
before
this
case
is
finally
resolved
in
the
courts.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
i
think
that
technically
what
the
california
supreme
court
decided
was
that
our
facts
did
not
state
a
cause
of
action
under
state
law.
what
they
cite
here
as
findings
are
actually
discussions
of
the
legal
issues
raised
by
the
state
court
complaint
under
state
law.
they
don't
amount
to
a
factual
finding.
there
was
no
trial.
there
was
no
summary
judgment
motion.
there
was
no
evidence
presented
on
any
of
these
points.
these
are--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--the
case
in
state
court
went
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
which
was
granted
by
the
trial
court,
reversed
by
the
state
court
of
appeal,
and
then
affirmed
by
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
that's
not
the
argument
that
we
made
in
this
court.
that
is
an
argument
that
we
made
in
the
lower
courts.
the
argument
that
we're
making
in
this
court
is
rather
that
under
the
england
case...
or
rather,
the
rationale
of
the
england
case,
there
shouldn't
be
any
issue
preclusion
whether
or
not
the
state
courts
made
any
factual
findings.
i
don't
think
that
the
question
as
framed
by
your
honor
is
presented
by
the
briefs.
i
mean,
obviously,
that
was
a
contention
of
ours.
we
think
that's
a
correct
statement
of
how
the
case
should
have
been
resolved
by
the
ninth
circuit,
but
the
ninth
circuit
instead
chose
not
to
look
at
that
issue
or
not
to
decide
the
case
on
that
issue,
but
instead
to
decide
under
its
prior
precedents
of
dodd
and
palomar,
that
issue
preclusion
applied
and
then
applied
its
own
formulation
of
the
equivalent--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--that
would
be
a
simple
route
to
knocking
out
the
case.
the
ninth
circuit
rejected
that
argument.
that
question
did
not
seem
cert-worthy
and--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--i
can't
quite
tell.
i
think
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
was
that
because
state
law
and
federal
law
on
this
question
was
similar,
at
least
in
the
ninth
circuit's
understanding,
that
the
state
court
determination
was
an
equivalent
determination.
once
they
made
that
finding,
that
there
was
an
equivalent
determination
under
state
law,
the
ninth
circuit
decided
that
the
claim
must
be
precluded
by
issue
preclusion.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
it
does
extend
to
questions
of
law.
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that
the
state
court
question
of
law
that
was
decided
was
whether
our...
we
were
entitled
to
compensation
under
state
compensation
law.
the
state
court
did
not
decide
whether
we
were
entitled
to
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
the
california
supreme
court
did
say
that
its
compensation
law--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--i
think
that
means
that
the
california
supreme
court
would
like
to
believe
that
its
law
is
congruent
with
this
court's
decisions.
i
think
that,
in
fact,
the
california
supreme
court
does
not
follow
this
court's
precedents
in
this
area
of
law,
and
i
think
we
actually
argued
the
first
time
that
we
were
in
front
of
the
ninth
circuit,
that
it
was
futile
to
go
to
state
court
precisely
for
that
reason.
that
argument
was
also
rejected
by
the
ninth
circuit.
i
think
that
it
cannot
be
that
the
state
courts
are
going
to
be
the...
our
final
arbiter
of
whether
their
law
is
in
fact
congruent
with
federal
law
or
not.
it
left
either
to
this
court--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--i
think
congruent
means
that
it's
equivalent.
i
think...
i
think
the
ninth
circuit's
view
of
an
equivalent
determination
is
that
it's
close.
it's
close
enough
for
government
work,
perhaps.
[laughter]
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
i
think
that
what's
important
is
the
very
beginning
of
your
question.
you
said
that
we
said
in
state
court
that
it
violated
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
the
california
supreme
court
decided
whether
those
legal
propositions
were
relevant
under
the
state
constitution
and
the
state
compensation--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--and
they
made
that
decision
under
state
law.
they...
they--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--in
the
hypothetical
that
your
honor
gave
of
a
factual
determination
that
the
clerk
spoke
english
well,
that
fact
under
the
england
case
and
under
england's
rationale
would
be
subject
to
relitigation
in
federal
court
in
the
pullman
context.
and
we
believe
that
there's
no
significant
difference
between
our
context
and
the
pullman
context.
i
do
recognize
that
that
is
contrary
to
the
normal
rules
of
res
judicata.
the
normal
rules
of
res
judicata
are
designed
to
prevent
exactly
what
this
court
decided
should
be...
should
happen--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--the
factual
claims--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--yes,
your
honor.
the
factual
claims
that
we're
making
in
federal
court
are
the
same
factual
claims
that
we
made
in
the
state
court--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--that--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--well,
in
this
particular
case,
they
found
that
the
facts
that
we
alleged
did
not
give
rise
to
a
right
to
compensation
under
state
law.
and
this
court
in
williamson
said
once
you've
been
denied
compensation
in
state
court,
once
it's
certain
that
the
state
courts
will
not
provide
you
relief
under
state
law,
you
have
a
ripe
federal
takings
claim.
at
that
point,
the
federal
courts
must
be
able
to
look
at
the
factual
questions
underpinning
the
federal
takings
analysis,
so
that
the
questions
of
whether
in
fact
this
law
substantially
advances
a
legitimate
government
interest
or
it
interferes
unduly
with
the
reasonable
investment-backed
expectations
under
penn
central,
which
requires
a
detailed
ad
hoc
factual
analysis,
that
that
must
be
done
by
the
federal
courts
and
cannot
be
precluded
by
a
state
court
determination
that
is
not
considering
the
federal
questions
at
the
time
or...
and
it
cannot
even
under
this
court's
decision
in
williamson
county...
cannot
consider
the
federal
question
that's
at
issue.
the...
the
city...
the
city
contends
that...
that
a
decision
in
our
favor
would
result
in--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that
it
was
not
made.
i'm
saying
that
a
state
court
disposed
of
that
claim
without
doing
a
factual
trial,
but
simply
based
on
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
the
court
did
not
find
that
they
were
insufficient
under
penn
central.
the
court
found
that
under
state
compensation
law,
which
it
believed
was
congruent
with
this
court's
decision
in
penn
central--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--issue
preclusion
should
not
apply
because
it
prevents
the
federal
courts
from
deciding
the
federal
takings
questions.
if--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--you
shouldn't
defer
here
because
in
williamson
county,
you
required
that
parties
go
through
two
litigations.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
and
all
the
rules
of
res
judicata
are
designed
to
prevent
two
litigations
and
to
require
a
single
litigation.
it
makes
no
sense,
in
the
context
of
a
two-litigation
system
that
this
court
set
up,
to
then
impose
issue
preclusion.
otherwise,
federal--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--correct.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
it
clearly
set
up
parallel
systems
of
litigation.
it
did
not
discuss
the
question
of
what
happens
in
the
second
litigation,
but
i
think
that
this
court
in
england
decided
the
proper
solution
to
a
situation
where
the
federal
law
requires--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--the
england
case--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--the
england
case
held
that
when
you're
required
to
do
two
separate
litigations,
the
first
in
state
court
and
the
second
in
federal
court
as
a
result
of
pullman
abstention,
that
in
the
second
case
there
would
be
no
factual
or
legal
issues
that
were
decided
in
the
state
court
that
would
be
preclusive
in
deciding
the
federal
claims--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--as
it
comes
to
this
court,
it
is
not
a
pullman
abstention
case.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
it
is
a
case
where
williamson
county
has
held
that
before
you
can
bring
your
federal
takings
claim,
you
must
first
go
to
state
court
and
obtain
a
determination
of
whether
you're
entitled
to
compensation.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
williamson
county
case
says
that
you
have
to
go
to
state
court
and
use
the
state
procedures
available
for
state
compensation.
you
cannot
do
that
without
going
through
the
appellate
procedure
provided
by
the
state
courts--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--as...
as
i
read
the
williamson
county
opinion,
it
says
that
you
have
to
use
the
state
procedures
that
are
available
to
obtain
compensation.
and
the
state
procedures
in
california
are
an
inverse
condemnation
claim
under
state
law,
i.e.,
a
state
compensation
claim,
which,
as
i
read
williamson
county...
and
i
think
all
the
other
practitioners
of
takings
law
read
williamson
county...
means
that
you
have
to
go
to
state
court
and
ask
for
compensation
before
you
can
proceed
to
federal
court.
now,
it
is
possible
that
a
state
could
have
an
administrative
procedure
instead
of
a
judicial
procedure
in
order
to
decide
takings
claim...
rather,
to
decide
state
compensation
claims.
if
there
were
such
an
administrative
procedure
for
obtaining
state
compensation,
then
that
perhaps
is
what
williamson
county
envisioned
that
you
would
follow.
but
i
think
williamson
county
says
whatever
procedure
is
provided
by
the
state,
you
have
to
exhaust
that
and
obtain
a
denial
from
the
state
of
your
right
to
compensation
before
you
can
proceed
to
federal
court.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
no.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
i
think
that's
exactly
the
problem.
that
was
the
problem
we
faced
when
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
decide
our
federal
claims.
i
think
because
they
only
decided
our
state
claims,
we
were
not
able
to
seek
certiorari
on
the
merits
from
the
state
supreme
court
decision,
and
then
i
think
the
procedure
contemplated
by
this
court
in
williamson
county
was
that
you
could
return
to
federal
court
with
your
federal
claim
once
the
state
compensation
claim--
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
--we
did
reserve
the
federal
question
in
the
state
court
litigation.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
f.
utrecht
thank
you,
your
honor.
there's
no
question
that
williamson
county
creates
problems.
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
did
not
just
issue
a
pullman
abstention
order
the
first
time
we
were
there.
they
dismissed
our
as-applied
claims
as
unripe.
it
dismissed
our
facial
claim
based
on
economic
viability
as
unripe.
so
we're
squarely
within
the
context
contemplated
by
williamson
county;
i.e.,
we
proceeded
in
state
court
with
our
state
compensation
claim
in
order
to
ripen
the
federal
claim.
the
city
acknowledges,
as
a
result
of
that,
that
there's
no
claim
preclusion.
and
this
court's
decision
in
migra
says
that
if
there's
a
reason
not
to
apply
claim
preclusion,
there
should
also
be
a
reason
not
to
apply
issue
preclusion,
that
there
should
be
an
exception
for
both
or
an
exception
for
neither.
in
this
case,
in
addition
to
acknowledging
an
exception
for
claim
preclusion,
mr.
waxman
also
acknowledged
that
if
the
state
court
was,
as
i...
my
notes
show,
so
far
off
the
reservation,
the
federal
court
could
revisit
the
question.
the
problem,
of
course,
with
so
far
off
the
reservation
is
that
might
be
a
good
test
for
this
court
to
adopt,
but
if
the
city's
position
is
correct,
this
court
does
not
have
that
opportunity.
this
court
is
stuck
with
whatever
law
the
state
imposes
under
issue
preclusion.
so
this
court
is
not
free,
if
the
city
is
correct,
to
create
some
special
exception.
i
think
the
only
basis
for
finding
a
separate
exception
in
this
case
is
the
one
that
this
court
set
out
in
england.
i
see
no
reason
that
it
shouldn't
be
extended
to
this
circumstance.
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
