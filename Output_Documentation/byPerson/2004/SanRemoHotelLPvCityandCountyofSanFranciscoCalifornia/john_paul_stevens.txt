justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt?
because
i'm
just
not
following
one
part
of
your
argument.
are
you
saying
that
the
pennsylvania
analysis,
the
ad
hoc
analysis,
was
not
made
in
the
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why...
now,
why
should
that
not
be
binding
on
you
if
your
allegations
were,
in
fact,
insufficient
under
penn
central?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
can
understand
how
you
should
be
free
to
argue
that
in
fact
the
two
rules
are
not
congruent,
that
there's
broader
recovery
under
the
federal
system.
but
if
we
decided
that
the
two...
if
we
agreed
with
them
that
they
were
congruent,
then
why
should
not
issue
preclusion
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but...
but
it's
just
a
conclusion
from
issues
that
have...
have
been
resolved
on
which
normally
we
would
defer
to
the
state
court.
now,
why...
why
shouldn't
we
defer
here
again?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
waxman,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
supposing
the
california
court
had
decided
the
federal...
the
federal
fifth
amendment
question
or
in
the...
the
england
supposing
the
louisiana
state
court
had
decided
the
fourteenth
amendment
question,
would
there
be
issue
preclusion
on
that
issue
in...
in
that...
in
that
sequence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
either
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
petitioners
own
and
operate
the
san
remo
hotel
in
san
francisco,
california.
in
1993,
in
response
to
petitioners'
request
to
convert
their
property
from
a
residential
hotel
into
a
full
time
tourist
hotel,
the
city
planning
commission
required
them
to
meet
a
number
of
conditions
including
the
payment
of
a
conversion
fee
of
$567,000.00.
petitioners
sued
in
federal
court
contending
that
the
conditions
constituted
a
taking
of
their
property
without
just
compensation
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
federal
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
however,
both
found
that
petitioners
had
not
yet
been
denied
just
compensation
for
the
taking
because
they
had
never
asked
the
state
court
to
provide
them
with
just
compensations.
thus,
the
courts
held
petitioners
did
not
have
a
right
fifth
amendment
injury
under
our
decision
williamson
county
regional
planning
against
the
hamilton
bank
of
johnson
city.
the
federal
courts
dismissed
petitioners'
unripened
claim
and
agreed
to
abstain
from
deciding
the
rest
of
petitioners'
claims
while
they
return
to
state
court.
back
in
state
court,
petitioners
raised
essentially
the
same
takings
claims
that
they
had
tried
to
advance
in
federal
court.
after
the
california
courts
denied
petitioners'
claim
on
the
merits,
they
attempted
to
reraise
the
same
issues
back
in
the
federal
district
court.
petitioners
argued
that
they
had
reserved
their
federal
claims
under
a
case
called
england
against
louisiana
and
a
board
of
medical
examiners,
and
therefore
that
preclusion
doctrine
should
not
prevent
them
from
retaining
a
fresh
review
of
the
underlying
issues
in
the
litigation.
they
also
argued
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute
which
requires
federal
courts
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
state
judicial
proceedings
should
not
apply
because
they
had
been
forced
to
litigate
their
claims
involuntarily
in
state
court.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
disagreed.
the
court
held
that
the
doctrine
of
issue
preclusion
prevented
the
court
from
revisiting
all
issues
that
were
actually
decided
in
the
state
court.
here,
because
the
court
found
california
takings
law
coextensive
with
federal
law,
all
of
the
underlying
issues
raised
by
petitioners'
federal
complaint
had
already
been
decided
in
full
by
state
courts.
the
court
declined
that
petitioners'
invitation
to
create
a
judicial
exception
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute
rejecting
the
argument
that
williamson
county's
requirement
that
takings
claims
must
first
be
advanced
in
state
courts
is
unfair
if
applied
to
preclude
relitigation
in
federal
court.
for
reasons
that
are
fully
stated
in
our
written
opinion,
we
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit.
we
do
not
read
our
england
decision
to
permit
the
type
of
relitigation
petitioners
requested
here.
moreover,
none
of
our
prior
cases
permit
us
to
create
a
judicial
exception
to
a
validly
enacted
congressional
statute
simply
to
afford
a
litigant
the
opportunity
to
raise
a
federal
claim
in
a
federal
forum.
finally,
because
we
do
not
read
williamson
county
to
preclude
takings
claims
from
being
fully
litigated
in
state
courts,
there
is
no
cause
to
except
takings
plaintiff
from
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute.
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
therefore
affirmed.
the
chief
justice
has
written
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
o'connor,
kennedy
and
thomas
have
joined.
