justice

mr.
utrecht,
you...
you
refer
to
the
primacy
of
federal
courts.
i'm...
i'm
not
clear
as
to
whether
you
are
arguing
for
a
different
disposition
where
suit
is
first
brought
in
federal
court
erroneously
because
there's
been
no
exhaustion
and
then
the
plaintiff
is
sent
back
to
state
court
from
the
situation
in
which
a
plaintiff
does
the
right
thing
and
goes
to
state
court
immediately.
now,
in
that
case,
would...
would
you
still
argue
for
primacy
of
the
federal
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so
your
case
does
not
hinge
on
the
fact
that
when
the
state
court
acted,
there
was
a
pending...
a
pending
federal
case
asking
for
the
federal
constitutional
question
to
be
resolved
by
a
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
want
us
get
that...
to
that
question
either,
whether
dolan
applies
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
they
said
that
their...
their
compensation
law
was
congruent
with
ours?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you...
what
do
you
think
that
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you...
if
you
disagreed
with
the
resolution
of
an
issue
by
the
state
court,
which
issue
would
be
determinative
of
your
federal
claim,
if
we
hold
against
you
here?
do
you
think
you
would
have
a
right
to
appeal
that
state
court...
state
supreme
court
resolution
of
that
issue
to
this
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
strikes
me
as
strange
about
this...
this
system
is...
is
not
leaving
it
to
the
state
courts
to
make
these
decisions.
that's
perfectly
fine.
we
do
that
all
the
time.
but
these
are
decisions
that
are
going
to
be
conclusive
on...
on
a
federal
claim,
and
yet
there's
no
way
to...
to
appeal
from
the
state
supreme
court
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
they
could
have
come
up
here,
though.
i
mean,
maybe
that
was
their
mistake
in
not
making
their
federal
claim
in
the
california
court.
the
california
court
would
have
denied
their
state
claim,
presumably
denied
their
federal
claim,
and...
and
both
could
have
come
up
here
i
suppose.
or...
or
would
the
california's...
would
california's
determination
of
the
state
questions
preclude
a
separate
determination
of
the
federal
questions?
