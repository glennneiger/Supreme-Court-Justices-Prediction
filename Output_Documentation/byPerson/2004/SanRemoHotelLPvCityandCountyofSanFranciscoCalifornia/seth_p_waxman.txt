mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondents
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
every
issue
relevant
to
their
federal
claims.
when
they
came
to
federal
court,
they
agreed
that,
with
one
exception,
all
of
the
relevant
issues,
both
the
ultimate
issue
of
a
reasonable
relationship
and
all
of
the
predicate
issues
that
we
recited,
as
justice
ginsburg
noted,
at
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief,
had
already
been
litigated.
they
said
that
they...
there
was
one
difference,
which
is
that
they
claimed
that
under
the
fifth
amendment,
the
level
of
scrutiny
under
a
substantially
advances
claim,
which
is
what
they
were
litigating,
was
the
nollan/dolan
test
of
rough
proportionality,
not
the
more
deferential
standard
of
review
that
the
california
supreme
court
applied
in
its
decision.
and
as
to
that
issue,
they
received
a
full
litigation
and
adjudication
on
the
merits
in
the
courts
below.
they
petitioned
this
court
on
that
substantive
question.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
here
i
was
referring
to
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
following
the
california
supreme
court's
decision.
they
came
to
the
courts
and
said
there's
one
thing
that's
different.
there's
one
element
that's
different,
and
that
is
nollan
and
dolan.
heightened
scrutiny
should
apply
to
a
financial
exaction
of
this
sort.
the
california
supreme
court
disagreed
under
california
law.
we
want
to
litigate
that
issue
here,
and
they
did.
the
district
court
ruled
against
them
on
the
merits.
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
against
them
on
the
merits.
they
petitioned
this
court
in
question
2.
this
court
denied
review.
in
all
other
respects,
their
claims...
their
case
under
their
federal
claims,
which
were
not
claim-precluded,
were,
as
the
district
court
found,
quote,
based
on
the
exact
same
facts
and
circumstances
argued
before
the
state
courts.
now,
they...
their
case
here
boils
down...
and
it's
quite
clear
from
their
reply
brief,
and
mr.
utrecht
has
reaffirmed
it...
to
an
argument
that
this
court's
1963
decision
in
england
ought
to
be
extended
to
the
williamson
county
context.
now,
i
believe
that
england
is
distinguishable...
highly
distinguishable
from
the
facts
or
the
circumstances
of
a
williamson
county
remand
for
any
number
of
reasons
that
i
can
explain.
but
ultimately
my
point
is
this.
england
is
fatal
to
them.
if
england
were
extended
to
this
circumstance,
they
would
lose,
and
that
is
because
in
england,
the
court
was
entirely
clear
that
as
to
the
state
law
issue
that
the
supreme
court
said
should
be
presented
to
the
louisiana
courts
first
for
determination,
there
was
no
doubt
that
issue
preclusion
was
going
to
apply
to
that.
the
question
was
whether
or
not
principles
of
preclusion
would
bar
them
from
coming
back
to
federal
court
otherwise.
in
other
words,
in
england,
the
question...
there
was
a
challenge
by
chiropractors
to
a
state
law
that
said
chiropractors
have
to
go
to
medical
school
or
something
like
that.
a
federal
complaint
was
raised
under
1983,
saying
that
violates
our
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
that's
wrong.
the
supreme
court
said,
well,
wait
a
minute.
we're
not
sure
that
the
louisiana
law
covers
chiropractors,
and
if
it
doesn't,
we
can
avoid
the
federal
constitutional
question.
so
we're
going
to,
in
effect,
certify
to
the
louisiana
courts
the
question,
the
state
law
question,
whether
chiropractors
are
covered.
now--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
they
used...
they...
they
abstained
under
the
pullman
doctrine
which,
as
this
court
has
explained,
is
a
procedure
that
is
akin
to
the
certification
process
where
states
use
it.
but
in
any
event,
no
one...
when...
no
one
would
have
thought
for
a
moment
that
having
gone
to
litigate
that
state
law
issue
in
state
court,
if
they
had
lost,
england...
the
chiropractors
could
come
back
and
say,
okay,
we
think
that
we
shouldn't
have
to
comply
with
this
law
for
two
reasons:
one,
because
we're
not
covered
by
the
law
even
though
the
louisiana
courts
thought
so;
and
two,
if
we
were,
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
prohibit
it.
they...
the
question
on
which
you
granted
review
is
limited
to
those
issues,
and
there
is
a
fair
question
on
the
record
in
this
case
whether
any
of
those
issues
are
really
before
the
court
now.
but
as
to
those
issues,
for
which
williamson
county
requires
that
a
party
resort
first
to
state
procedures,
whether
issue
preclusion
applies,
and
the...
the
extension
of
england
by
analogy
to
this
would
dictate
the
answer
yes.
it
may
not
apply
if...
if
you
extend
england
to
all
other
types
of
issues
that
a
party
may
litigate
along
with
their
williamson
county
ripening
exercise.
but
the
very
determination
that
federal
law
requires
them
to
obtain
under
state
law,
prior
to
stating
a
ripe
federal
constitutional
claim,
of
course,
gets
issue
preclusion.
now,
the
question
was
asked--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
think...
well,
i
would
have
to
take
a
very
deep
breath
before
i
told
the
court
that
it
was
not
open
to
the
court
to
reconsider
just
about
anything
that
touched
on
it.
i
think
it
would
be--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--let
me
explain
why
i
think
it
would
be
imprudent
for
the
court
to
resolve
it
and
then
explain
why
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
court
didn't
consider
one
way
or
the
other
principles
of
preclusion
in
application
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
in
williamson
county.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
it
would
be
imprudent
to
decide...
i...
i
think
that
the
court
will
have
to
elaborate
on
the
williamson
county
requirement
and
how
the
procedures
work.
i
hope,
after
all
the
preparation
for
this
argument,
i'll
be
able
to
participate
in
some
way
in
that
debate
because
it's
a
really
interesting
question.
but
it's
not
presented
here
because
even
if
you
were
to
reconsider
williamson
county,
even
if
you
were
to
overrule
it,
it
wouldn't
affect
the
outcome
here.
we
know
two
things
are
true
in
this
case,
whatever
williamson
county
means
doesn't
mean
or
shouldn't
mean.
every
issue
relevant
to
the
federal
constitutional
claims
was
fully
and
fairly
litigated
in
this
case,
and
we
also
know
that
under--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
that
it
was
not
deciding
the
federal...
the
fifth
amendment
federal
constitutional
question.
but
they...
they
concede
that
all
of
the
issues
that
make
up
the...
the
federal
constitutional
question
were
fully
and
fairly
litigated
in
the
california
courts
except
the
question
of
whether
the
fifth
amendment,
as
opposed
to
the
california
takings
provision,
is
entitled
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to
nollan
and
dolan.
and
that
was
litigated
here.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the...
it's...
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
requires
that
you...
requires
that
you
apply
the
preclusion
law
of
the
state
that
rendered
the
judgment
to
which--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--which
would
be
california.
and
i
do
think,
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
california
supreme
court...
i'm
sorry...
the
ninth
circuit
made
clear
that
it
was
applying
california
preclusion
law.
it
cited
the
california
supreme...
a...
california
authorities,
and
it
correctly
recited
the
elements
of
the
california
preclusion
law
in
this
regard.
it
did
make
reference
to
its
prior
determination
in
dodd
v.
hood
river,
which
was
an
oregon
case,
in
which
the
ninth
circuit
decided
that
an
england
reservation
in
the
williamson
county
context
was
effective
with
respect
to
claim
preclusion
but
not
issue
preclusion.
and
in
that
respect...
and
this
i
think
goes
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about,
you
know,
what...
what
could
we
have
been
thinking
or
not
thinking
in
williamson
county...
the...
the
dodd
case
provides
a
pretty
good
example.
at
the
time
this
court
decided
williamson
county,
many,
probably
most
states
did
not
have
a
substantive
takings
jurisprudence
that
was
akin
to
the
federal
standard.
for
example,
california
itself,
new
york
didn't
provide
compensation
for
regulatory
takings
at
all.
in
those
states,
there
would
be
no
question
of
either
claim
or
issue
preclusion
because
in
the
course
of
deciding
whether
or
not
compensation
was
due
under
state
law,
there
would
be
few,
if
any,
common
issues
decided.
now,
as
the
ninth
circuit
explained
in
dodd
v.
hood
river,
oregon
recognizes...
in
the
context
of
regulatory
takings,
recognizes
an
agins
type
claim,
that
is
where
you
are
completely
denied
all
economic
value
to
your...
i'm
sorry...
a
lucas
claim,
but
they
don't
recognize
the
penn
central
standard.
they
don't
provide
compensation
unless
you
are
denied
all
economic
value.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
issue
preclusion
or
claim
preclusion?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
the
answer
is
there...
if
england...
if
the
england
decision
were
extended
to
the
williamson
county
context,
there
would
not
be
claim
preclusion.
we
think
it
shouldn't
be
extended,
and
therefore
if
they
litigated
both
their
state
claim
and
their
federal
claim
in
state
court,
we
think
they
would
be
barred
both
by
issue
and
claim
preclusion.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
i
think
it
was
certainly
open
to
them
and
the...
the
ninth
circuit,
in
its
first
opinion,
made
clear
that
it
was
open
to
them,
when
they
went...
when
they
did
their
williamson
county
ripening,
to
also
litigate
the
federal
constitutional
question.
and
in
that
instance,
if
they
lost
in
the
california
courts,
of
course,
they
could
have
petitioned.
they
couldn't...
if
they
lost
on
the
state
constitution,
the
court
would
have
had
to
reach
the
federal
constitutional
question
as
well.
but
i
think,
justice
scalia,
more
to
your
point
about
what
actually
happened
here,
i
think
that
a
very
good
argument...
i...
i
don't
think
that
there's
really
much
doubt
that
if
they
had
petitioned
for
certiorari
from
the
california
supreme
court
decision,
you
could
easily
have
granted
review
under
zacchini
and
michigan
v.
long
and
ruiz
because
the
california
supreme
court
said,
to
be
sure
we
are
deciding
only
the
state
constitutional
question.
we
are
not
ruling
on
the
fifth
amendment.
but
they
made
very
clear
that,
whatever
congruent
means...
they
made
very
clear
that
they
looked
to
this
court's
statements
and
expositions
about
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
construe
the
claims
the
same.
and
as
this
court
said
in
ohio
v.
reiner,
i
think
2
years
ago,
when
a
state
court's
interpretation
of
state
law
has
been
influenced
by
an
accompanying
interpretation
of
federal
law,
we
may
review.
and
in
fact,
if
you
think
about
it,
think
of
almost
every
takings
case
that
you've
decided
since
williamson
county.
with
the
exception
of
the
tahoe
compact
cases,
they
are
all
from
state
court
decisions.
lucas,
palazzolo,
first
english,
nolan
and
dollan,
yee,
pennell,
mcdonald,
san
diego,
they
are
all--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
because
that
was
a
case...
that's
the
other
one
that
i
was
thinking
of
this
morning.
that
was
a
case
that
was
filed
in
the
district
court
and
litigated
in
the
district
court.
and
it
raises
a
real
anomaly
about
whether
or
not
this
case
even
really
presents
the
question
on
which
you
granted
review
because
their...
the
theory
that
they
have
pursued
in
state
court
and
at
this
round
in
federal
court
is
that
there
is
a
takings
violation
under
both
the
state
and
the
federal
constitution
under
the
so-called
substantially
advances
prong.
their
complaints
allege
a
penn
central
violation,
but
their
briefs
in
the
lower
court...
in
the
lower
federal
courts
in
this
proceeding
and
in
the
state
courts
don't
discuss
penn
central
at
all,
as
the
california
supreme
court
in
footnote
14
of
its
opinion
explained.
so
if
this
is
just
a
substantially
advances
claim,
it
raises
the
question,
number
one,
whether
in
the
context
of
legislation,
there
is
a
substantially
advances
prong
in
the
fifth
amendment,
a
question
that
you're...
you're
asked...
that
you
are
presumably
addressing
in
lingle
v.
chevron.
if
there
is,
it
raises
the
separate
question
posed
by
this
court's
decision
in
yee
whether
that
is
a
claim
for
compensation.
in
other
words,
what
this
court
said
in
yee
is
when
you
challenge,
under
the
fifth
amendment,
legislation
on
the
grounds
that
it
doesn't
substantially
advance
a
legitimate
government
objective,
this
court
said,
that's
not
a
claim
for
compensation.
that
is
a
claim
that
the
ordinance
be
struck
down
and
not
applied.
and
that's
what
they're
litigating
here.
now,
they
have...
and
so
the
question
is
if
it's
not
a
claim
for
compensation,
is
it
subject
to
williamson
county
ripening?
why
should
you
have
to
go
to
state
court?
so
there
are
a
lot
of
this...
the
conference
of
state
chief
justices
have
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
support
actually
of
us
in
this
case,
saying
we
don't
see
that
the
facts
of
this
case
present
the
question
on
which
you
granted
review.
i
think
it's
fairer
to
say
it's
not
clear
because
the
petitioners
did
challenge
this
ordinance
not
only
on
its
face,
but
as
applied.
and
although
the
district
court
below
found
that
it
wasn't
a
real
as-applied
challenge
because
they
couldn't
in
any
meaningful
way
distinguish
themselves
from
the
other
500
residential
hotels
in
san
francisco,
all
of
whom
are
concededly
subject
to
the
hotel
conversion
ordinance.
at
least
i
suppose
in
theory,
there
is
some
claim
for
compensation
for
the
temporary
period
in
which
they
were
subject
to
the
hotel
conversion
ordinance.
so
i...
i
don't
know.
i...
you
granted
cert
in
the
case.
we'd
like
to
get
the...
the
question
answered,
but
i
think
the
reason
this
long
disquisition,
justice
kennedy,
about
del
monte
dunes
is
in
del
monte
dunes,
it
was
a
substantially
advance
claim,
and
i
think
it
was
thought
that
there
was
no
need
to
engage
in
williamson
county
ripening.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
at
most...
i
mean,
they
could
certainly
make
the
argument.
at
most,
preclusion
would
give
way
on
the
ultimate
lucas
question,
not
all
of
the
subsidiary
issues
that
were
resolved
en
route
to
that
determination,
issues
akin
to
the
ones
that
we
recited
at
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief.
that
is,
if
the
district...
if
the
state
court
finds,
you
know,
that
the
property
is
in
such
and
such
a
place
and
on
such
and
such
a
year,
this
thing
happened
or
that
the
ordinance,
as
it
applied,
had
this
effect
or
that
effect,
there
certainly
would
be
no
possible
argument
that
issue
preclusion
wouldn't
apply
because
they...
those
were
necessary
determinations
and
they
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
determine
it.
as
to
the
ultimate
issue,
this
would
be...
the
full
faith
and
credit
act
directs
the
federal
court
to
ask
what
would
the
law
of
california
say
about
this.
if
they
tried
to
then
bring
their
federal
constitutional
lucas
theory
in
state
court,
would
issue
preclusion
or
claim
preclusion
principles
bar
a
second
bite
at
the
litigation
apple?
the
answer
ordinarily...
and
you've
asked
me
to
assume
that
the
tests
that
they
have...
they
purport
to
be
stating
the
federal
standard.
ordinarily
the
answer
would
be
no
if
the
argument
simply
is
they
made
a
mistake.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
what
happens
in
issue
preclusion.
that's
what
in
allen
v.
mccurry
and...
and
all
of
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
applied
full
faith
and
credit,
kremer
and...
and...
i'm
forgetting
the
names
of
the
other
cases.
the
argument
was,
yes,
they
thought
they
were
adjudicating
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
they
were
wrong,
and
issue
preclusion
shouldn't
apply.
i'm...
i'm
qualifying
my
answer
a
little
bit
because
i
do
think
that
if
you
came
to
federal
court
and
said,
look,
this
was
a
sham
or
they...
they...
their
analysis
was
so
skewed
that
it
can't
fairly
be
said
that
they
were
really
applying
the
federal
standard,
something
like,
you
know,
the...
the
aedpa
standard
now
that...
that
you
get
review
if
it's
an...
not
just
an
incorrect
determination,
but
a
wholly
unreasonable
application
of
law
or
fact.
then
i
think
you
would
look
and
see,
well,
would
a
state
court
say,
well,
that's
right.
i
mean,
if
your
allegation
is
that
they
were
so
far
off
the
reservation
that
it
really
wasn't
a
determination
of
that
issue,
i
think
you
get
a
new
review.
i
mean,
i
do
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
to
the
contrary.
not
only...
there's
no
pullman
issue
presented
in
this
case,
but
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
demonstrates,
if
anything,
a
full-throated
appeal
to
the
state
courts.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
have
been
absolutely
no
such
allegations
made
in
this
case.
and
i
think
a...
i
think
that
the
san
remo
would
have
to
concede
that
although
there
was
a
plethora
of
litigation
in
the
state
courts
and
in
the
lower
federal
courts
about
the
zoning
determinations
and
whether
a
conditional
use
permit
was
or
wasn't
required,
the...
the
hotel
conversion
ordinance,
the
ordinance
that
requires
the
payment
of
this
in
lieu
fee,
applies
across
the
board
to
all
residential
hotels
based...
wherever
they're
located
in
the
city,
whether
they're
in
a
historic
district
or
not
and
whether
they
have
to
be
rezoned
or
not.
it
was
a
simple,
straightforward
question
about
whether
an
ordinance
that
says
if
you
run
a
residential
hotel
or
you
have
residential
rooms
that
you
have
certified
as
of
the
date
the
ordinance
was
enacted
and
you
want
to
change
them
permanently
to
full-time
tourist
use,
you
have
to
bring
an
equivalent
number
of
units
on
line
or
you
have
to
pay
an
in
lieu
fee
to
the
city's
building
fund.
and
they
made
a
challenge,
like
many
people
have,
that
substantively
that
violates
the
federal
and
state
takings
clause.
that
is
a
taking
of
private
property
without
just
compensation.
but
it
applies
to
all
the
residential
hotels
in
the
city
wherever
they're
located,
regardless
of
whether
they
need
variances
or...
or
anything
like
that.
now,
in
this
case
they
went
first
to
the
superior
court
in
san
francisco
and
they
filed
an
administrative
mandamus
claim
challenging
the
zoning
determination
that
was
made
in
their
case
because
they're
in
a
historic
district.
and
at
the
same
time,
they
went
to
the
federal
court
and
they
raised
all
of
their
takings
claims
with
respect
to
the
ordinance
and
the
zoning
issues.
they
got
a
preliminary
injunction
in
federal
court
which
was
then...
but
then
lost
a
summary...
they
had
summary
judgment
issued
against
them
on
all
the
substantive...
all
the
claims
in
their
case.
when
they
came
to
the
ninth
circuit,
they
asked
the
ninth
circuit
to
abstain
under
pullman
because
they
had
this
municipal
law
question
pending
in
the
superior
court.
it
had
been
pending
for
5
years,
and
that
might
somehow
obviate
or
change
the
constitutional
question.
and
they
then
went
to...
they...
the...
the
ninth
circuit
noted
that
it
was
rather
unusual
for
the
plaintiff
to
be
invoking
pullman
abstention
and
certainly
to
be
doing
so
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
after
losing
in
the
district
court,
but
nonetheless,
the
ninth
circuit
said
fine.
and
they
then
went
to
state
court,
and
they
pressed
not
only
their
pending
municipal
law
question,
but
they
also
made
their
takings
claims
under
penn
central
and
under
the
substantially
advance
prong
both
as
applied
and
both
facial
under
the
state
constitution.
and
they
received
a
full
and
fair
hearing
on
those
claims
in
the
superior
court,
in
the
court
of
appeal
where
they
won,
and
in
the
california
supreme
court
where
they
ultimately
lost
4
to
3.
there...
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
argument
made
or
available
in
this
case
that
there
was
a
denial
of
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
those
issues
as
to
which
preclusion
is
required.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the...
the
california
supreme
court
decision
makes
clear
at
page
113a
of
the
petition
appendix
that
it
decided
the
takings
claims,
the
substantially
advance
claims,
on
a
demurrer
and
that
they
decided
it,
therefore,
based
on
the
factual
allegations
of
the
complaint,
matters
subject
to
judicial
notice,
of
which
there
were
many,
and
facts
and
circumstances
that
were
not
disputed.
i
mean,
it...
there's
no
such
thing,
i
don't
believe,
as
the
resolution
of
a
legal
claim
in
which
no
issues
are
decided.
there
were
plenty
of
issues
decided
in
this
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the...
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
hotel...
whether
or
not
the...
san
francisco's
hotel
conversion
ordinance
was
reasonably
related
to
the
city's
objective
was
litigated
with
a
vengeance.
it
was
litigated
to
the
point
of
dozens,
if
not
hundreds
of
pages
in
the
state
court.
the
state
court...
the
state
courts
made
a
number
of
subsidiary
findings
leading
to
their
conclusion
that,
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied,
the
hotel
conversion
ordinance
was
reasonably
related
to
the
city's
legitimate
objective
of
retaining
low-cost
rental
housing
for
the
elderly,
the
disabled,
and
the
poor.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
the
application
of
law
to
fact.
what
the
court
decided...
this
court
said,
i
think
in
yee--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
the...
the
courts
were
asked
to
take
judicial
notice
of
a
number
of
things.
they--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
mean,
what
the
court--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it...
what
the
court
said...
and
i
think
this
is
a...
what
the
california
supreme
court
said
at
page...
i
think
it
was
page
113a
and
they
also
reiterate
this
point
at
page
139a,
footnote
12...
is
this
is
a
demurrer.
so
we
take...
we
accept
as
true
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
plus,
we
take
judicial
notice
of
all
the
things
that
the
parties
asked
us
to
take
notice
of,
which
are
matters
of
public
record,
of
which
there
were
many,
many,
many
in
this
case,
including,
for
example,
the
fact
that
every
year
from
1990...
well,
every
year
from
the...
from
1983
on,
when
they
took
over
operation
of
this
property,
they
filed
with
the
city
an
annual
report
that
listed
that,
a,
the
determination
that
all
62
of
their
rooms
were
for
residential
use
and
then
explained...
and
then
stated
out
the
exact
number
of
rooms
by
quarter
that
were,
in
fact,
used
by...
for
long-term
residences
and
those
that,
during
the
summer
months,
were
used
for
tourist
use.
the
court
took
judicial
notice
of
that,
as
it
was
appropriate,
en
route
to
its
decision...
this
is
a
subsidiary
issue
i
suppose...
that
the
conversion
of
this
hotel
to
full-time
tourist
use
would,
in
fact,
cause
a
loss
in
the
stock
of
available
affordable
housing.
that
was
an
issue
that
was
determined
in
this
case.
and
the
ultimate
question
decided
by
the
court
was
a
mixed
question.
it
was
the
application
of
law
to
fact,
as
this
court
explained,
i
think
in
yee,
is
characteristic
of
substantially
advances
claims.
thank
you
very
much.
