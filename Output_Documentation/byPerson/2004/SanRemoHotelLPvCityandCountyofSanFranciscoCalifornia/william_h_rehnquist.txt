we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
04-340,
san
remo
hotel
v.
the
city
and
county
of
san
francisco.
mr.
utrecht,
is
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
supreme
court
of
california
decided
only
the
state
constitutional
question,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
the
case
go
up?
on
a
motion
to
dismiss?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
understand
the
word
congruent
to
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
that
williamson
county
ever
contemplated
that
you
would
have
to
take
your
case
all
the
way
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
now,
it
may
be
that
you
had
no
choice
once
you
got
into
the
state
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
williamson
county
by
its
terms
spoke
of
going
to
state
court
and...
rather
than
just
a
state
administrative
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
you
seek
to
reserve
the
federal
question
in
the...
in
the
state
court
litigation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
utrecht.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
courts
below.
are
you
talking
about
the
california
state
courts
or
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean,
they
didn't
really
certify
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
wait
a
minute.
you
don't
mean
that
the
fifth
amendment
question
was
fully
and
fairly
litigated
in
the
supreme
court
of
california.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
preclusion
law
do
you
apply?
the
ninth
circuit
apparently
applied
oregon
preclusion
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
would
be
california.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
demurrer--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--a
demurrer
is
decided
on
the
pleadings,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
mr.
utrecht,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
utrecht.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

opinion
of
the
court
in
san
remo
hotel
versus
san
francisco
will
be
announced
by
