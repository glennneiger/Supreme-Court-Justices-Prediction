justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
i
have,
mr.
ayer,
is
i
don't...
i
can
accept
your
belief
that...
that
subparagraph
refers
to
all
of
(a)
and
yet
still
agree
with
the
respondent
here
or
with
the
court
below
because
what...
what
limits
the...
the
phrase,
shall
not
be
less
than
$100
nor
greater
than
$1,000...
what
limits
it
to
subpart
(2)
is
not
the
word
subparagraph
but
rather
the
fact
that
it
is
an
exception
only
to
(2).
the
liability
under
little...
what
you've
called...
what...
(ii)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
liability
under
(ii)
is
a
liability
under
this
subparagraph,
and
the
exception
to
little
(ii)
is
only
an
exception
to
little
(ii).
so
i
can
read
under
this
subparagraph
to
mean
perfectly,
exactly
what
you
say
it
means,
in
the
case
of
an
individual
action
relating
to
a
consumer
lease
the...
the
liability
would
be
25
percent,
except
that...
that
is
an
exception
from
what
we've
just
said...
liability
under
this
subparagraph,
which
includes
(ii)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that
may
be,
but
now
you're...
now
you're
relying
on...
on
the...
on
the
statutory
history
argument
rather
than
on
the
mere
meaning
of
the
word
subparagraph.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
i
can...
i
can
concede
that
subparagraph
means
what
you
says...
say
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
refers
to
all...
all
of
(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
but
when
that
phrase
is
used
in
an
except
clause
that
only
applies
to
little
(ii),
it...
it
still
says
the...
the
foregoing
liability
under
this
subparagraph,
that
is,
the
liability
contained
in
little
(ii)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
a
liability
under
this
subparagraph.
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
convention,
it
seems
to
me,
is
much
less
strong
than
the
fact
that
you
don't
read
a
word
to
mean
one
thing
for
purposes
of
one
part
of
the...
of
the
whole
paragraph
and
another
thing
for
the
purposes
of
the
rest.
if...
if
you
read
it
the
way
you
want
us
to
read
it,
it
would
apply
to
little
(iii)
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
simply
a
flat
contradiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
the...
the
reading
given
by
the
court
below
produced
no
flat
contradiction
in
the
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
no...
no
contradiction
within...
within
the
statute
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
have
given
what
you
call
the
rosetta
stone
a
different
meaning,
but
it
did
not
produce
a...
a
contradiction
in
the
terminology
of
the
statute,
whereas
yours
does.
you
want
us
to
read
subparagraph
to
mean
all
of
(a)
except
not
for
purposes
of
(iii).
you
want
us
to
do
it
for
purposes
of
(ii)
but
not
for
purposes
of
(iii).
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
straightforward.
the...
the
specific
controls
the
general
where
there
is
an
unavoidable
conflict.
there
is
no
unavoidable
conflict
here.
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
urging
that
one
interpretation
is
better
than
another,
and
if
there
were
an
unavoidable
conflict,
i
would
agree
that
(iii)
would...
would
overrule
(ii),
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
read
(ii)
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
to
have
to
go
through
the...
the
legends
of
the...
of
the
legislative
process
every
time
i
read
a
statute.
if
congress
wrote
it
this
way--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
interpret
it
the
way
it
is
written.
why...
why
do
i
have
to
go
back
and
say,
oh,
this
is
what
it
used
to
be?
and
when
they
added
this
word,
if
they
made
a
mistake,
they
made
a
mistake,
but
the
language
reads
the
way
it
reads,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
my
job
to
correct
their
mistakes.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
this
appear
somewhere
in
the
papers?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
citing
them.
okay.
you're
going
to
read
it.
i'll
close
my
eyes
and
listen.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
he's...
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
i...
i
want
to
hear
more.
what
does...
what
does
this
prove?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
because
(c)
doesn't
do
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
read
it...
read
it
once
more,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
couldn't
be
under
(c).
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
getting
back
to
the
language.
why
don't
you
talk
about
some
of
the
other
points
that
justice
breyer
was
raising?
what
about
the
purpose?
what
purpose
would
there
be
not
to
have
a
limit
on
little
(i)
and
have
it
on
the
other
two?
why...
why
would
it
make
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
no
reason
why
it
would
make
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
blankingship,
i
thought
that
part
of
your
response
to
justice
souter
would
have
been
that
there's
nothing
anomalous
about
imposing
a
dollar
limit
on
massive
transactions
and
not
imposing
a
dollar
limit
on
smaller
transactions,
that
that
is
precisely
what
you
would
expect
congress
to
do.
the...
the
need
for
a
dollar
limit
on...
on
home
mortgages
is...
is
obvious,
and
the
need
for
a
dollar
limit
on...
on
smaller
loans
is
less
obvious.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
answer.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i've
never
heard
counsel
refuse
to
answer.
i
would
just
like
to
see
it
happen.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
the
answer.
the...
the
answer
is
that
it
is
not
implication,
that
there
is
a
new
statutory
text
which,
if
it
means
what
you
say
it
means,
has
expressly
repealed
the
earlier
one.
now,
if
it
doesn't
mean
what
you
say
it
means,
then
i
guess
it's
by
implication.
but
if
it
means
what
you
say
it
means,
there's
no
implication.
there's
a
statutory
text
which
means
something
different
from
what
the
prior
text
meant,
and
that's
a
repeal.
