mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
starting
point
is
not
the
starting
point
established
by
this
court.
the
starting
point
in
this
case
established
by
this
court
in
the
lamie
decision
and
those
prior
is
clearly
the
statute
before
you.
he
talks
of
history.
he
talks
of
what
happened
in
the
past.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
what
does
the
statute
we
have
mean.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
justice
o'connor,
i'm
not
certain
what
it
meant.
what
i
first
read
it--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--i
agree
that
that's
what
the
opinions
in
the
dryden
and
the
mars
case
said,
but
i
would
point
out
that
in
both
of
those
cases
that
was
not
the
issue
before
the
court.
in
those
cases,
the
plaintiff
had
lost
down
below.
there
wasn't
an
issue
of
damages,
and
when
the
circuit
court
sent
them
back,
they
told
them
what
the
measure
of
damages
was
without
any
discussion.
i
personally,
when
i
read
the
statute
and
first
started
this
practice,
thought
that
it
was
limited
to
(ii).
i
then
did
some
research--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--well,
the
answer
is
this
subparagraph.
it's
not
just
subparagraph.
it
refers
to
this
subparagraph.
thus,
it
is
much
clearer
or
more
precise
as
to
where
it's
located.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
well,
the...
the
answer
i
believe
is
in...
is
in
the
context
of
the
statute.
you
must
look
to
the
context
of
the
entire
statute
and...
and
look
and
see
that
there's
obviously
a
conflict
between
(ii)
and
(iii).
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
i
would
disagree
with
you
because
of
the
language,
the
word
or.
you
see,
when
you
see
or
that
appears
after
(ii),
after
the...
after
the
damages--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--you
have
to
understand
that...
that
all
three
of
these
are
very,
very
different.
they
have
different
rules.
they
have
different
requirements,
and
they
have
different
elements.
they
all
have
different--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--before
1995,
there
weren't...
there
was
not
the
section
regarding
the
home
mortgages.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
i
don't
think
you
should
accept
it
as
a
starting
point
because
of
the
history.
if
you
look
at
those
cases,
they
were
never
litigated.
that
issue
was
not
litigated--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--history
suggests
that
most
of
those
cases
that
came
up...
and
if
you
look
at
them...
in
the
early
years
were
the
technical
cases.
they
were
not
cases
that
involved
a
lot
of
money.
they
were
simply
very
technical,
minor
wording--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--that...
that
was
the
assumption
that
was
made
at
that
point,
and
the
fourth
circuit
followed
that
assumption.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
no.
no,
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
that...
that
it
was
applying
to
both
of
them.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
but
that
was
an
assumption,
and
as...
and
as
judge
luttig
pointed
out,
that
was
the
assumption
of
the
fourth
circuit
at
the
time,
but
when
it
got
a
new
piece
of
evidence,
when
the
statute
was
amended
and
added
(iii),
it
explained
clearly
that
the
assumption
was
debunked.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
yes,
i
do.
i
do
think
it...
it
is
possible
because--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--no.
that's...
that's
not
correct.
it
would
not
have
happened
that
way
because
there
is
a
cap
under
(i).
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
under
(i)
there's--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
it's
$25,000.
the
maximum
amount
financed.
if
you
finance
a
car
for
$26,000,
there
are
no
remedies--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--no.
it...
it...
prior
to
that,
it
did
not
apply.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
no.
no,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--correct.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
second
mortgages.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
well,
it's
a
closed-end.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
they...
no.
they
would
be...
they
would
fall
under
(iii).
it
says
or.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
that's
correct--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--correct.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
no.
i...
i
believe
that's
incorrect--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--in
that
it
would
not
have
applied
to
over
$25,000
at
the
time.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
right.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
subsection
(iii)
was
a
completely
different
set
to
deal
with
the--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--no,
no.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
the
amount
financed.
i'm
sorry.
i
misspoke.
it's
not
the
finance
charges.
it's
the
amount
financed
is
$25,000.
as
a
result,
you're
looking
at
obviously
much
less
during
that
period
of
time.
also
under
(i),
you
have
a
limited
statute
of
limitation
of
1
year.
so
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
come
back
10
years
later
and
say,
gee,
i
want
all
my
finance
charges
back.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
petitioner
argues
that
the
term
subparagraph,
as
used
in
tila,
always...
always...
means
the
capital
letter.
that
is
not
correct.
if
the
court
looks
at
the
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner
on
page
23--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
generally
throughout
the...
the
u.s.
code,
they...
they
argue
that
specifically
within
tila
that
it
has
never
been
used
to
mean
something
else.
there
is
an
example
that
they
have
cited
that...
that
supports
their
position,
and
that's
1637a(a)(6)(c).
and
if
you
look
at
that
portion
of
the
federal
truth
in
lending
act,
it
only
has
the
following
language.
under
the
capital
letter
c--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--no.
this
was
cited
by
them
in
their
footnote.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
from...
from
the
statute
itself,
1637a.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
it
is
not
in
the...
it
is
cited
in
a
footnote
to
support
the
proposition
that--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--it
is
on
page
23.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
no.
no,
your
honor.
it...
it's
set
out
as...
as
a
string
of
cites
to
support
the
proposition
that
congress,
in
enacting
tila,
never
used
the
term,
this
subparagraph,
in
an
improper
way.
and
if
you
look
at
that
section,
the
only
language
in
that
section
is
capital
(c)...
retention
of
information
is
the
identifier.
and
the
language
says,
a
statement
that
the
consumer
should
make
or
otherwise
retain
a
copy
of
information
disclosed
under
this
subparagraph.
period.
that's
it.
that's
all
that
appears
under
(c).
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
it
proves
that
it
clearly
could
not
be
referring
to
the
capital
letter
(c).
it
must
be
referring
to--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--(c)
doesn't
have
any
requirements.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
certainly.
a
statement
that
the
consumer
should
make
or
otherwise
retain
a
copy
of
information
disclosed
under
this
subparagraph.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
it
couldn't
be
possible.
correct.
so
there
are
examples
when
congress
drew--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--well,
there
are...
i
agree
with
that.
yes,
it
does
a
number
of
times.
but
you
also
see
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
footnote,
some
of
them,
under
subparagraph
(a)(iii)
where
it's
being
more
specific.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
the
term,
this
subparagraph,
doesn't
have
anything
to
modify
it
to
explain
exactly
what
it's
supposed
to
mean.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
if
it
said
that,
i
don't
think
we'd
have
a
dispute
here.
that
would
be
clear.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
well,
the
fourth
circuit
looked
at
that,
and
they
looked
at
the
language
on
how
it
was
going
to
work
together.
and
they
found
that
it
was
the
only
way
to
put
a
square
peg
in
a
square
hole.
petitioner
argues
that
we
should
put
a
round
peg
in
a
square
hole.
we
should
ignore
the
conflict
with
(iii).
we
should
ignore
the
fact
that
it
has
completely
different
requirements
and
completely
different
limits,
and
we
should
then
try
to
treat
it
as
a
carve-out
of
(i),
but
the
problem
with
that
language
is
the
or.
it
doesn't
say
and.
it
doesn't
say
an
alternative.
it
says
or.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
well--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--there's
only
one
limit.
if...
if
you
read
the
statute
our
way,
there's
only
one
limit
in...
in
(ii).
there
is
no
limit
on
(i).
there's
no
limit
on
(iii).
the
fact
that
congress
decided
to
treat
leases
somewhat
differently
does
not
necessarily
mean--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--right,
but
it's
not
a
limit
to
anything.
that
is
the
damage.
it's
not
a
limit.
it's
not
you
get
the
finance
charge
or
something
else.
you
see,
there...
there's
only
one
that
has
two
options,
and
that's
(ii).
all
the
rest
have
one
option.
it's
very
clear.
under
(i),
it's
two
times
the
finance
charges.
one
of
the
things--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--okay.
in
(iii),
the
amount
of
$200
to
$2,000
is
simply
the
icing
on
the
cake.
it
is
not
the
cake.
the
cake
is
the
ability
to
rescind
the
transaction
within
3
years
and
get
all
of
your
money
back,
which
is
not
an
option
under
(i).
(i)
has
only
the
cake,
which
is
the
two
times
the
amount
of
the
finance
charges.
it's
the
only
damages
you
get
there.
under
(iii),
it's
just
an
additional
bonus
damage.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
you
can.
it
does
say
that...
that
it's
the
sum
of,
and
all
of
them
are
added
together.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
well,
the
problem
is
that
it's
very
difficult
to
prove
actual
damages
under
the
federal
truth
in
lending
act
because
there
is
that
requirement
that
you
go
and
show
that
you
could
have
gone
somewhere
else
and
gotten
a
better
deal,
which
by
the
time
the
consumer
comes
to
the
lawyer,
that
time
has
passed.
it
never
happens.
and
as
a
result,
there
are
almost
no
cases
that
involve
actual
damages
under
(i).
the
only
damages
you
can
get
under
(i)
are
the
statutory
damages.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
i'm
sorry.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
no,
justice
stevens,
we
did
not.
we
only
got
the
statutory
damages.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
i
disagree
that
there
are
no
limitations.
there
are
a
number
of
limitations
under
(i).
(i)
is
the
hardest
of
all
of
the
three
to
prove
and
succeed.
the
first
limitation
is
the
amount
financed
cannot
be
more
than
$25,000.
in
the
case
of
somebody
who
buys
a
car
with
good
credit,
they
have
0
percent,
0.9
percent
financing.
their
damages
would
be
very
small.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
but
the...
the
cap
is
the
amount
of
the
finance
charges,
the
total
amount
of
the
finance
charges.
so
if
you
start
with
a
principal
balance
of
$25,000,
even
if
you
have
a
very
high
interest
rate
like
mr.
nigh's,
over
20
percent,
the
damages
are
not
going
to
be
even
half
of...
in
this
case,
it
was
$12,000.
it's
less
than
the
half
of
the
maximum.
so
there
is
a
cap.
there
are
a
number
of
caps.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
i...
i
disagree.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
i...
i
disagree
with
that
analysis
because
under
subsection
(4),
you're
going
to
be
able
to
go
back
and
demand
rescission.
you're
going
to
be
able
to
get
all
of
your
money
back.
you
will
get
much
more
under
the
home
mortgage
situation.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
well,
in...
in
this
case,
in
mr.
nigh's
case,
he
was
not
made
whole.
in
this
case,
he
had
two
cars
that
were
repossessed
from
him,
and
that
was
not
something
that
the
federal
truth
in
lending
act
could...
could
resolve.
when
he
came
out
of
this
case,
he
was
much
worse
than
he
was
when
he
went
in.
he
now
has
two
repossessions
on
his
credit.
so
i...
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
he's--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--well,
under
the
truth
in
lending
simplification
act
of
1980,
congress
came
back
and
put
a
number
of
limits
on
(i)
that
did
not
apply
to
(iii),
but
do
apply
to
(i).
and
you
can't
get
violations
for
technical
wording,
misuse
of
the
wording.
under
(i),
the
only
one...
the
only
way
you
can
get
damages
is
to
prove
that
one
of
the
magic
numbers,
the
amount
financed,
the
finance
charge,
the
apr,
or
that
they
failed
to
give
you
the
disclosures
altogether.
only
under
those
situations,
do
you
even
qualify
to
get
the
statutory
damages.
it's
very
limited
and
it's
very
difficult.
it's
not
a
simple
mathematical
error,
which
is
what
happened
prior
to
the
simplification
act.
in
the
mars
case
and
the
other...
in
the
dryden
case,
those
were
simple
mathematical
errors.
they
were...
or
just
misrepresentations
as
to
the
wording
of
the...
of
the
disclosures
under
the
federal
truth
in
lending
act.
that's
not
the
case
now.
those
will
no
longer
provide
statutory
damages.
you
must
prove
that
they
have
done
something
wrong.
and
in
this
case,
the
proof
was
that
they
added
a
silencer
that
mr.
nigh
never
wanted,
that
he
didn't
want,
and
in
fact,
they
had
packed
this
into
the
loan
3
days
before
they
brought
him
back
in.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
i
would
agree.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
it...
it
is
possible
there
are,
but
there
are
so
many
different
variables.
it
can
be
that
way.
in
a
0
percent
financing
chance,
it
will
not.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
of
the
amount
due
on
the
lease,
yes.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
it's
a
little
bit
different.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
well,
i
think
that's...
that's
potentially
right.
and
there's
a
big
difference
between
(i)
and
(ii)
also.
under
(ii),
the
statute
of
limitations
is
1
year
after
the
lease
expires.
thus,
if
you
were
to
lease
a
car
for
4
or
5
years,
you
have
a
5
or
6-year
statute
of
limitations.
under
(i),
it's
much
more
limited.
you
have
a
1-year
statute
of
limitations.
it
is
the
most
difficult.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
i
think
i
know
where
you're
going
too.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
well,
i...
i
think
in
the
united
bank
v.
wolas
case,
where
the
court
held
that
the
fact
that
congress
may
not
have
foreseen
the
consequences
of
a
statutory
enactment
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
refusing
to
give
effect
to
its
plain
meaning,
is...
is
probably
the
answer
to
the
question.
congress
may
not
have
intended
or
maybe
they
did
intend.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
and
that's...
i
absolutely--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
yes,
by
its...
by
its
language,
by
its
introduction.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
i
would
agree
that
that's
what
the
law
was
and
that's
what
had
been
stated
before.
i
think
if
you
go
back
and...
and
the
other
problem
with
these...
these
statutes
or
these...
these
prior
cases--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--no.
the
statute
then
becomes
what
it
is.
i
think
that...
that
the
fourth
circuit
did
precisely
what
it
was
instructed
by
this
court
to
do,
which
is
to
look
at
the
statute
the
way
it
is
enacted
in
front
of
it
today
and
to
read
that
statute
and
to
try
to
find
a
way
to
make
a
fit.
and
in
this
case
they
found
that
it
was
a
square
peg
in
a
square
hole,
that
everything
fit,
as
justice
scalia--
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
--they
did
leave
them
alone,
as
they
have
in...
in
a
lot
of
these
amendments.
they
come
and
add
different
things.
they
don't
necessarily
change
them.
but
in
this
case,
you
have
to
look
at
the
statute
we
have
before
us,
and
under
that
particular
statute,
it's
clear
that
it
can't
work
where
the...
the
limiter
on
(ii)
applies
to
(i)
and
(ii),
but
not
to
(iii).
if
it
applies
to
all
of
(a),
then
it
must
apply
to
(i),
(ii),
and
(iii),
not
just
to
(i)
and
(ii).
and
thus,
that's
why
the
fourth
circuit
said
we
cannot
apply
it
this
way.
it
does
not
make
sense.
if
it
is...
subparagraph
is
all
of
(a),
then
there's
a
clear
conflict
with
(iii),
and
which
petitioners
then
go
and
argue,
well,
now
we'll
explain
it
as
a
carve-out,
but
the
carve-out
argument
loses,
i
submit,
because
of
the
or.
mr.
a.
hugo
blankingship
iii
it
did
not
reenact
the
whole
section.
that's
correct.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
