mr.
donald
b.
ayer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
straightforward
case
of...
of
statutory
construction
in
which
the
words,
context,
purpose,
and
history
of
the
statute
in
question
all
point
to
a
single
meaning
that
is
contrary
to
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
court
below.
the
case
concerns
the
truth
in
lending
act's
basic
statutory
damages
provision,
1640(a)(2)(a)(i),
or
little
(i)
i'll
call
it
here,
which
since
the
statute's
enactment,
has
allowed
individuals
to
recover
from
lenders
who
violate
the
act
an
amount
equal
to
twice
the
finance
charge,
but
limited
to
a
range
of
$100
to
$1,000.
this
statutory
damage
recovery
is
available
under
the
act
without
regard
to
actual
injury
or
intent
or
fault
by
the
lender.
in
addition
to
statutory
damages,
the
act
provides
for
actual
damages
to
be
available,
administrative
agency
enforcement,
and
criminal
penalties.
i
want
to
just
talk
briefly
about
the
history
of
the
act
because
i
think
it's...
it's
critical
to
understanding
the
issue
before
the
court,
and
i'll
refer
to
places
where
we've
quoted
it
in
the
blue
brief.
as
enacted
in
1968...
and
this
provision
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
5
of
our
brief
up
to
the
top
of
page
6.
the
provision
i've
described
was
the
only
statutory
damage
provision,
and
it
was
followed
by
language
that
indicated...
and
i
should
say
it
appeared...
and
this
is
important...
at
that
time,
in
section
1640(a)(1)
and
began
right
there
after
the
(1).
and
the
limitation
of
liability
that
appears
there
says
the
words
that
liability
under
this
paragraph
shall
not
be
less
than
$100,
nor
more
than
$1,000.
that
section
was
first
amended
in
1974,
and
the
amended
language
appears
at
the
top
of
page
7
of
our
brief.
and
what
happened
in
1974
was
that
this
provision...
the
actual
words
of
the
provision
were
not
changed
except
for
one,
but
it
was
moved
because
other
things
were
added
to
the
statute.
and
it
now
became...
instead
of
1640(a)(1),
it
became
section
1640(a)(2)(a).
the
only
change
in
the
provision,
the
only
word
changed
was
the
change
from
the
word
paragraph...
liability
under
this
paragraph...
to
the...
to
the
word
subparagraph.
the
next
amendment...
and
then
the...
the
statute
after
this
then
stood
for
nearly
20
years
unchanged
at
all.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it...
it
described
subparagraph
(a).
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
and
i'll
explain--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
capital.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
not
in
'74,
your
honor.
in...
the
next--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--in
1976--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
precisely
correct.
and
what
was
done
in
'76
was
congress
passed
the
consumer
leasing
act,
and
it
added
a
second,
i'll
call
it,
(ii).
i'm
sorry.
it
added
an
(i)
in
front
of
the
original
provision,
so
it
was
then
1640(a)(2)(a)...
capital
(a),
little
(i).
and
then
in
'76,
(ii),
and
the
(ii)
was
a
provision
not
really
relevant
here
except
that
it's
in
the
middle
of
what
we're
talking
about.
it
dealt
with
leases
and
had
a
formula
with
regard
to
leases.
it
is
uncontested
by
any
court
certainly
that
from
that
time
forward
to
1995,
the
cap
that
appeared
then
at
the
end
of...
of
little
(ii)
applied
to
both
sections...
i'm
sorry...
clauses
(i)
and
little
(i),
and
that
limitation--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
there
are--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of...
of
cases
that
applied
it
presumably
to
plaintiffs
if
they
thought
they
had
an
argument,
would
have
liked
to
argue
they
could
have
gotten
more
than
$1,000,
but
there...
there
are
a
bunch
of
cases
we've
cited
in
our
brief
that...
that
show
that
that
was
the
consistent
interpretation.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct,
actually
clauses,
your
honor,
but
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
what
then
happened
in
1995...
and
this...
the
actual
enactment
appears
in
the
blue
brief
at
page
10,
footnote
6,
and
this
is
also
i
think
important.
what
congress
did...
and
they
were
in
the
midst
of
a
series
of
amendments
relating
to
mortgages
that
was
made
necessary...
the
range
of
them
necessary
by
a
court
of
appeals
decision
that
created
quite
a
crisis
of
threatened
liability
to
the
mortgage
industry.
in
this
respect
here...
they
enacted
a
lot
of
other
things,
but
with
regard
to
this
provision,
as
footnote
6
indicates...
and
it's
mostly
over
on
page
10...
all
they
did...
they
did
not
even
reenact
the
preexisting
provision.
they
simply
said
move
the
or
from
the
middle
of
that
provision
to
the
end
and
insert
the
following
language,
and
the
following
language
was
the
expression
of
an
intent
to
increase
the
cap
on
a
class
of
loans
that
had
actually
previously
been
included
in
the...
in
the
overarching
provision
that
relates
to
loans,
which
is
the
original
one
that
we're
talking
about
here
that
deals
with
twice
the
finance
charge,
capped
at
$1,000.
they
added
the
language
that
essentially
says,
relating
to
a
credit
transaction
not
under
an
open
end
credit
plan
that
is
secured
by
real
property,
i.e.,
a
mortgage,
not
less
than
$200
nor
greater
than
$2,000.
and
in
that
respect,
they
clearly
acted
to
provide
a
higher
cap
with
regard
to
mortgage
transactions
and
to
pull
those
out
of
the
first
section
and
into
the
last.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
your
honor,
we...
we
have...
and...
and
your
reasoning...
and
i'll...
and
i'll
expand
on
it
slightly.
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below...
and
it's
essentially
a
syllogism
i
think,
and
it's...
it's
not
far
from
what
your
honor
has
just
said.
it
is
essentially
that,
well,
the
reference
to
subparagraph
formerly
did
refer
to
subparagraph
(a).
now
congress
has
added
clause
(iii)
which...
with
its
own
cap.
so
the
limitation
to
$1,000
clearly
cannot
apply
to
clause
(iii).
therefore,
it
can
no
longer
apply
to
all
of
clause
(a).
therefore,
it
must
refer
to
something.
what
does
it
refer
to?
it
has
to
refer
to
clause
(ii)
only.
and
the
problem
with
that
is
essentially
threefold,
and
i'll...
i'll
go
through
them
quickly
and
then
expand
upon
them,
if
i
can.
the
first
is
that,
as...
as
your
honor
has
stated,
the
word
subparagraph...
i
won't
call
it
a
term
of
art,
but
it
has
a
very
clear,
specific
meaning
in
the
context
of
this
provision.
that's
the
first
point.
the
second
point--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
no,
your
honor.
we
did...
we
did
not.
and
let
me...
let
me
just
explain
what...
we've
been
trying
to
think
about
how
to
understand
those
manuals,
and
the
best...
the
best
idea
i've
heard
from
anyone
is
to
refer
to
them
as
a
sort
of
a
rosetta
stone.
they're
not
really
dictionaries.
they're
not
really,
i...
i
wouldn't
say,
authoritative
statements
of
the
way
words
are
always
used
in
federal
statutes
because
in
fact
you
can
find
exceptions.
you
can
find
mistakes.
you
can
find
departures.
but
they
are
a
tremendous
aid
in...
what...
what
it
tells
you
is
that
the
folks
who
are
drafting
legislation
as
technicians
have
in
mind
a
hierarchy
of
these
terms,
and
they
try
very
hard
to
use
them
in
a
consistent
manner,
and
they
have
for
the
last
50
years
because
we
have
books
that
go
back
to
1954
that
do
this.
and
so
the
question
becomes,
with
that
in
mind,
when
you
look
at
what
else
you
know,
does
that
help
you
understand
what
the
word
means?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
now,
that
was
a
bit...
all
of
that
was
true
prior
to
1995.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
refers
to
a
section
with
a
capital
(a).
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
okay.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
let
me
go--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
it
is,
your
honor.
i...
i'm
having
trouble
following
that,
your
honor.
and
let
me
go
back,
if
i
could,
to
1974
which...
and
let...
and
let
me
say
one
more
thing
about
1974.
the
last
time
this
limitation
was
actually
enacted
by
congress,
was
actually
put
into
words
and
put
into
a
piece
of
legislation,
as
opposed
to
adding
ornaments
to
it
or
things
in
between,
or
this
or
that,
was
in
1974.
in
1974,
all
they
did
with
this
provision
was
move
it
into
a
new
section
that
had
an
(a)
in
front...
a
capital
(a)
in
front
of
it
and
out
of
one
that
had
a
(1)
in
front
of
it.
and
they
changed
the
word
from
paragraph
to
subparagraph.
and
i
would
suggest
the
rosetta
stone
or
the
stones
in
these
manuals
that
tell
us
what
they
tend
to
want
to
have
in
mind
when
they're
doing
this
tell
us
exactly
what
they
were
thinking
about
when
they
put
the
word
subparagraph--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--absolutely,
your
honor.
completely
correct.
i...
that...
i
can't
say
it
better,
and
i
won't.
the...
a
couple
things
i
will
say
that
are
important
are
that
when
you
go
through
the
true...
a
standard
way
of
reading
legislation,
if
you
want
to
know
what
a
word
means,
is
you
read
the
rest
of
the
legislation
in
issue.
when
you
read
the
rest
of
the
legislation
in
issue
and
you
find
that
there
are
a
total
of
37
references
to
the
word
subparagraph,
and
36
of
them,
without
any
ambiguity
at
all,
refer
to
a
letter...
a...
a
provision
that
starts
with
a
capital
letter.
if
you
read
the
entire
united
states
code,
you
can
find
some
instances
where
there
are
departures
from
this
standard
way
of
speaking.
a
number
of
them,
frankly,
are
in
statutes
back
to
the
'40's
and
'30's,
but
some
are
still...
there
are
mistakes
in
various
places.
but
again,
the
convention
that's
laid
out
in
these
manuals
is
the
one
that
the
courts
tend
to
follow.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
mean,
i
think
that
that's
the
next
thing--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
it...
it
flatly
contradicted
the
standing
meaning
of
the
word
subparagraph.
it
ignored
the
standing
meaning.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
principle
or
the
canon
that
the
specific
controls
the
general
is
one
that...
that
your
honor
set
forth
in
the...
in
the
casey
case,
and
many
other
cases
have
asserted
it.
what
went
on
here
in
1995
i
think
is
easy
to
discern.
what
it...
what
it
was
was
they
wanted
to
have
a
higher
cap
on
mortgage
loans
than
on
other
kinds
of
loans,
and
so
they
glued
a
provision
on
the
back.
was
it
done
elegantly?
was
it
done
as
clearly
as
it
might
have
been?
no,
but
as
the
court
said
in...
in
the
lamie
case,
it's
awkward
but
it's
still
straightforward
in
terms
of
meaning.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
only
if--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--what
you
have
to
do,
your
honor,
to
take
the
approach
that
the
court
below
took
is
ignore
the
established
meaning
of
the
word
subparagraph.
i
say
established
because
when
it
was
enacted
in
1974,
it's
perfectly
clear
why
the
word
subparagraph
was
put
in
there.
and
then
what
one
has
to
do
is...
is
hypothesize
that
the
1995
amendment,
which
did
not
reenact
the
original
provision,
but
simply
added
something
else
to
it...
and
it
wasn't
something
else
that
said
we've
just
gotten
rid
of
the
cap
on
(i).
it
was
something
else
that
said,
as
to
mortgages,
do
the
following.
that
that
by
inference
changed
the
meaning
that
was
put
in
the
word
subparagraph
in
1974
because
it
hasn't
been
reenacted
since.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
thought
your
honor
was--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
mean--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--again,
i...
i...
all
i
can
say
is
that
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
we
really
do
need
to
look
at
the
meaning
of
the
word
subparagraph
at
the
time
it
was
enacted
by
congress.
that
meaning
in
1974
is
utterly
clear.
and
what...
the
only
way
you
can
get
to
the
conclusion
of
the
court
below
is
by
saying
in
1995
congress
somehow
or
other
changed
the
meaning
that
was
put
in
the
statute
in
1974,
and
they
did
it
without
ever
saying
they
were
doing
it.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
am
not
positive
if
they
do
agree
with
that.
the
only
thing
i
can
say
for
sure
is
that
every
court
that
has
ever
addressed
the
issue
does
agree
with
that.
and
i...
and
i...
i
think
they
may
have
said
something
in
their
brief
to
question
that.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
that...
that
dollar
amount
in
this
case...
and...
and
the
judgment
as
it
now
stands
is
over
$24,000.
so
we--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--correct,
your
honor.
and...
and
the...
the
last
major
reason...
the...
just
to
summarize,
the...
the
two...
first
two
reasons
i
think
i've
given
now
for
why
the
decision
below
must
be
wrong
are,
first,
that
for
all
the
reasons
i've
tried
to
point
to,
the
word
subparagraph
really
has
quite
a
specific
meaning,
thankfully,
in
the
place
we're
talking
about
it
appearing.
and...
and
it
refers
to
a
section
starting
with
capital
letter.
second
point--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
there...
there
are
two,
your
honor.
one
was
published
in
the...
i
believe
the
house
manual
was
published
in
1995
and
actually
was
published
a
month
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
the
senate
manual...
but
there...
but
there
was
a
prior
version
of
it,
and
this
version
was
in
fact
in
draft
form
at
the
time.
but
the...
but
the
real...
the
point
i
want
to...
and...
and
the
senate
manual
was
in
fact--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right,
your
honor.
but...
but
we
also
in
footnote
15
and
in
the
text
on
that
page
refer
to
a
whole
collection
of
books,
drafting
books,
mostly
dealing
with
federal
legislative
drafting,
and
all
uniformly
saying...
and
again,
we're
not
trying
to
say
that
these
are
binding
authority.
we're
simply
trying
to
say
that
in
the...
in
the
process
of
federal
legislative
drafting,
this
is
what
the
legislative
draftsmen
try
to
do,
and
then
you
look
at
the
statute
and
you
look
to
see
what
they
in
fact
have
done.
and
you
see
that
this
provision
is
there
for
a
very
particular
reason.
and
so
we're
not
trying
to
trump
up
these
manuals
as...
you
know,
as
part
of
the
code
or
anything
else.
we're
simply
trying
to
say
they...
they
give
you
a
real
good
guidance
on
what
it
means.
and
then
when
you
look
at
the
statute
and
you
see
that
the
statute
consistently
uses
them
in
that
way,
uses
the
word
in
that
way,
you've
got
a
good
start
on
understanding
what
it
means.
the...
the
last
thing
i
want
to
say
deals
with,
as
i
guess
in
the
order
i
should
be
talking
about
it,
legislative
history.
and
there
are
two
points
on
that.
one
is
in
1995
by
adding
clause
(iii),
congress
added...
created
a
provision.
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
what
they
did
is
they
pulled
out
of
part
(i),
or
clause
little
(i),
which
dealt
with
loans
in
general
and
said
twice
the
finance
charge...
it
pulled
out
the
category
of
loans
that
were
mortgage
loans,
and
it
said
we
want
to
impose
a
higher
cap
on
those
loans.
and
there
is
legislative
history
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
indicates
that
that
was
what
they
were
thinking
about.
if
they
had
intended
to
eliminate,
entirely
eliminate,
not...
not
increase
from
$1,000
to
$2,000,
but
entirely
eliminate
the
cap
on
the
entire
category
of...
of
loans,
two
things
would
be
true.
number
one,
somebody
would
have
said
something
about
it
surely.
this
is
the
dog
that
didn't
bark,
as
this...
many
members
of
this
court
have...
have
observed.
and
there's
not
a
breath
of
a
thought
in
any
legislative
history
that
anybody
meant
to
do
this.
and
the
second
point,
which
is
even
perhaps
more
telling,
is
that
if
they
had
done
that,
they
would
have
contradicted
the
clear
purpose
of
what
they
did.
they
wanted
a
higher
cap
on
mortgage
loans
than
on
loans
in
general,
and
it's
clearly
the
case
that
if
they
had
eliminated
the
cap
on
loans
in
general,
they
would
have
a
lower
cap
on
mortgage
loans.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
your
honor,
i
mean,
there's
a
lot
of
speculation
in
a
number
of
the
briefs.
you
know,
there's
speculation
about,
you
know,
inflation
and...
and
there's
all
sorts
of
things
that
one
could
talk
about
endlessly
if
one
wants
to
talk
about
policy.
i...
i
think
the
answer
is
basically
no.
i
think
there's
really
no
good
reason
to
distinguish
between,
you
know,
no
cap
on
(i)
and
a
cap
on
(ii).
and
i'm
prepared
to
argue
this,
but
i
think
it's
way
down
in
the
noise
level
in
terms
of
what...
what
is
relevant
here.
the...
the
last
point
that
i
think
i
would...
i
would
like
to
make
is
just
that
if
the
court
decides
to
reverse
and
if
the
court
were
to
decide
that...
that
$1,000
cap
is
in
fact...
has
always
been
and
continues
to
be
the
law,
we
would
simply
ask
the
court
also
to
remand
with
regard
to
the
attorney
fee
award.
the
situation
in
this
case
would
then
be
that
the
plaintiff,
or
the
respondent,
will
have
recovered
$5,000.
the
petitioner
will
have
recovered
affirmatively
the
other
way
$3900.
it's
a
net...
a
net
of
$1,100.
and
the
court
below
reduced
the
fees
at
a
time
when
the
recovery
for
the
plaintiff
was
$29,000,
reduced
them
by
40
percent
on
the
ground
that
plaintiff's
counsel
had...
had
raised
40-some
claims,
all
of
which
failed,
except
for
2,
and
basically
indicated
that
that
was
a
strong
reason
for
reducing
the
claim.
i
would
submit
if
they
essentially
recovered
$1,000
in
this
case,
that
that
would
be
a
reason
to
submit
it
back
to
the
trial
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
my
time.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
just
have
a
short
list
of
things
i'd
like
to
address.
the
first
is
just
to
repeat
that
the
last
time
congress
enacted
the
word
subparagraph
in
this
provision
was
in
1974.
i
don't
understand
why
the
1995
amendment
is
not
simply
subsequent
legislative
history.
it
tells
us
nothing
about
what
congress
meant
in
1974.
the
second
point
is,
justice
scalia,
i'd
like
to...
i
wasn't
quick
enough
to
think
when
you
said
before
that
if
you
read
the
way
the
fourth
circuit
did,
there's
no
inconsistency.
indeed,
not.
there
is
still
an
incongruity
between
clause
(i)
and
clause
(iii)
because
contrary
to
what
mr.
blankingship
has
said,
ever
since
the
beginning
of
tila,
mortgage
transactions
have
been
covered
by
the
truth
in
lending
act,
i
can
assure
you.
and
prior
to
this
addition
in
1995,
they
were
dealt
with
in
clause
(i).
and
so
what...
what
you've
got
here
is
a
provision
that
says,
with
regard
to
loans
in
general,
the
cap
is...
you
know,
it's
twice
the...
the
finance
charge,
and...
and
then
whatever
we--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
was
in
(i),
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
1603,
your
honor,
specifically
says
that
credit
transactions,
other
than
those
in
which
a
security
interest
is
or
will
be
acquired
in
real
property.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
you
bet,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
absolutely.
that's
correct.
i
want
to
just
say
a
word
about
the
facts,
although
frankly
i
think
they're
utterly
irrelevant.
but
the
facts
here
are
that
summary
judgment
was
entered
against
mr.
nigh
on
40
or
so
claims.
three
went
to
trial.
among
the
claims
on
which
summary
judgment
was
entered
were
claims
for
fraud
and
claims
for
breach
of
contract.
the
reason
that
no
damages...
no
actual
damages
were
not
given
was
not
because
they
weren't
available.
they
were
available.
they
just
weren't
proven.
there
were
no
actual
damages
proven.
actual
damages
are
always
available
even
for
technical
tila
violations,
technical
in
the
sense
that
they're
within
the
group
that
are
said
to
give
rise
to
a
violation
under
1640(a).
i
do
want--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that
may
be
true,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
there's
a
question
of
how
one
goes
about
doing
that,
and
you
have
to
actually
show
harm.
and
so,
you
know,
the
question
is
how
do
you
prove
that
and
in
what
kind
of
a
case.
i
do
want
to
say
and
be
clear...
i
think
i
said
earlier
that
in
36
of
37
uses
in
tila,
the
meaning
is
clear
and
refers
to...
subparagraph
is
used
to
refer
to
a
capital
letter.
the
37th
is
not
clear.
in
fact,
i
would
agree
with
mr.
blankingship's
reading
of
it.
but
36
out
of
37
ain't
bad,
particularly
when
we
know
in
1974
exactly
what
they
meant
to
do.
the...
the
last
point
i
guess
i
just
want
to
sum
up
by
saying
is
that
i
think
this
case
really
has
a
lot
in
common
with
the
parable
of
the
elephant
and
the
blind
man.
and
when
a
blind
man
examines
an
elephant's
leg
and
decides
that
it's
a
tree,
maybe
it's
because
he
hasn't
been
able
to...
to
discern
what
else
is
out
there
and
consider
what
other
considerations
there
are.
and
in
this
case
i
think
clearly
what
we
have
is
a
case
where
simply
reading
a
single
sentence
of
a
statute
and
thinking
you
know
what
it
means
and
militantly
refusing
to
look
anywhere
else
will
very
likely
lead
you
to
the
wrong
answer
in
many
cases.
thank
you
very
much.
