(a).
capital
(a)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
it
ever
challenged
or
was
this
just
a
common
assumption?
was
that
ever--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--was
that
issue
litigated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
ayer,
if
i
just
read
the
statutory
language
as
it
appears
now,
the
impression
i
get
is
that
the
language
in
capital
(a),
little
(ii),
except
that
the
liability,
just
applies
to
little
(ii).
you
have
to
rely
on
kind
of
a...
a
word
of
art
in
the
use
of
subparagraph
to
reach
a
contrary
result
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
we
talk
about
the
facts
of
this
case?
would...
would
your
client
fall
under
little
(i)
as
a
result
of
what
happened?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
limit
there
would
be
twice
the
amount
of
any
finance
charge
in
connection
with
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--unless
the
except
provision
applies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
would
that
dollar
amount
be
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
argue
that
the
limitation
is
$1,000.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
there
be
any
conceivable
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
a
higher
damages
award
for
hard-to-detect
misconduct
of
the
type
under
little
(i)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what...
what
do
you
think
the
term,
this
subparagraph,
meant
before
1995?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
agree
that
the
courts
had
interpreted
it
to
apply
to
both
little
(i)
and
(ii)?
