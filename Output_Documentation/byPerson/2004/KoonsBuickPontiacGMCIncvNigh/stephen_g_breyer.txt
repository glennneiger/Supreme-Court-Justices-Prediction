justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
other
words,
if
that's
right,
i
guess
when
i
go
get
a
mortgage...
this
is
before.
i
get
a
mortgage
and
say
it's
a
half
a
million
dollars,
and
the
finance
charge
is
over
30
years.
it's
probably
$600,000
or
so.
and
some
technical
mistake
is
made
and
congress
would
have
wanted
me
to
collect
$1,200,000
in
damages.
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
under
(i)
there's
a
cap?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before.
the
older
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
maximum
amount
financed
on
my
house
was
$1,000,000.
i'm
saying
if
i
got
a
mortgage
before
they
added
paragraph
(iii),
how
did
it
work?
i
get
a
mortgage
on
my
house.
there's
a
finance
charge.
it's
over
30
years.
it's
a
huge
amount
of
money.
and
before,
i...
i
guess
on
your
reading
of
it,
i
could
have
collected
millions.
but
nobody
thought
that
was
possible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't
apply
to
mortgages
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
that's
the
answer.
fine.
i
got
the
answer.
now
we
have
a
mortgage
because
(iii)
brings
mortgages
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
closed-end
mortgages
fall
under
(iii).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
second.
what
about
an
open-ended
mortgage?
what
about...
what
about
a
home
equity
mortgage?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
home...
home
equity
mortgages,
do
they
fall
under
(i)?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it
says
closed.
it
says
non-open-ended.
it
says
under
an
open
end...
not
under
an
open
end
credit
plan.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
it's
under
an
open
credit
plan,
i.e.,
a
home
equity
mortgage,
it's
under
(i).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
okay.
so
i
can
just
replicate
my
example.
right
now,
we
have
finance
charges
on
those
things.
they
can
be
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars.
and
you're...
you're
saying
that
i
guess
we
could.
am
i
right?
that's
why
i'm
asking
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
(i).
so
we're
talking
about
the
range
of
$25,000,
$50,000
doubled.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
range
is
on
your
reading
under
(i),
and
what
i...
i've
been
telescoping
my
questions.
but
i've
come
away
with
the
impression
that
we're
talking
finance
charges,
if
your
reading
is
correct,
in
the
range
of
$25,000,
which
would
mean
the
damages
would
be
$50,000,
if
you
double
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
okay.
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
thank
you.
you've
answered
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
can
i...
maybe
you
can
help
me
with
this
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
difficulty
that
i'd
like
you
to...
for
me.
i'm
not
speaking
for
anyone
else.
but
when
i
read
a
statute,
i
first
read
it
usually
with
what
i
call
the
approach
of
an
english-speaking
martian,
a
person
who
doesn't
know
any
of
the
context.
i
just
read
the
language.
and
if
i
were
just
reading
the
language,
i
would
think
you
have
maybe
the
better
of
the
argument.
but
the
language
does
support
their
position
in
the
sense
that
theirs
is
a
possible
reading,
not
maybe
the
most
natural
for
our
english-speaking
martian,
but
nonetheless
a
possible
reading.
and
then
they
bring
in
all
these
other
claims.
first,
it
really
doesn't
make
sense
to
have
a
cap
on
everything
and
not
(i).
second,
that
isn't
obviously
what
anybody
thought
was
the
case
before
this.
third,
there
was
nothing
in
the
legislative
history.
fourth...
i
mean,
you
know,
fifth,
sixth,
seventh.
and
by
the
time
i'm
finished
with
it,
i'm
ready
to
abandon
my
english-speaking
martian
point
of
view
and
ask
what
was
the
human
purpose
underlying
the
statute
and
does
the
language
support
it.
now,
that's
what
i'd
like
to
hear
your
answer
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--thinking
it's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
do
you
mean
there's
no
limit
on
(iii)?
i
thought
it
said
$200
or
$2,000.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
he's
asking
what
the
purpose
of
this
would
be
for
these
mortgages,
you
know,
which
is
a
pretty
big
deal,
a
mortgage,
you
know,
really
putting
a
lot
at
risk
when
you
get
into
a
mortgage.
there's
a
limit
of
$2,000.
indeed,
it's
only
$2,000,
or
whatever
it
is.
no...
no...
you
can't
get
more
than
that.
and
as
to
(ii),
there's
the
limit
we're
talking
about,
and
why
would
anybody
want
(i)
to
be
limitless?
that's
the
question.
i'm
not
saying
there's
a
no
answer
to
it.
i
want
to
hear
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
in
(ii),
it's...
it's
covered.
you
have
a...
on
your
theory
of
it,
small
(ii),
(ii),
is
also
limited.
and
that's
only
$25,000,
i
gather,
as
well.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it...
so
it's...
so
you'd
have
to
say
congress
wanted
to
impose
a
limit
on
these
small
(ii)
$25,000
or
less
transactions,
but
they
didn't
want
to
impose
any
limit
on
the
small
(i)
$25,000
or
under
transactions.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
because
of
the
or.
because
of
little
(iii),
(iii).
take
out
(iii)
and
it
all
makes
sense.
what
it
says
is
to
the
whole
subparagraph
damages
are
limited
to
$1,000
or
if
it's
the
special
real
estate
thing,
they're
limited
to
$2,000.
and
if
that
little
(iii)
weren't
there,
it
would
be
clear.
but
the
little
(iii)
is
there,
and
you
say,
well,
maybe
sometimes
we
can
say
a
little
(iii)
is
superfluous.
it's
not
a
word,
after
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
so
i
was...
i'm
sorry.
that
was
the
one
thing
i
was
trying
to
clarify
in
this
that
i
thought
i
had...
that
i
didn't
understand--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
before
this
(iii)
came
about,
where
was
my
normal
home
mortgage?
was
it
covered
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
was
in
(i),
then
how...
but
he
says
at
1603,
there's
a
$25,000
limit
on
what's
in
(i).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
limited
to
$25,000?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
so
then...
then
i'm
back
the
opposite
of
what
i
was
thinking.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that...
that
prior
to...
prior
to
the
reenactment...
i'm
sorry.
this
is
the
one
thing
i
was
trying
to
clarify
in
this
oral
argument.
prior
to
the...
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
new
amendment,
your
secured
mortgage
transaction
is
up
in
(i).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
and
then
after,
although
the
non-open-ended
one
is
in
(iii),
my
home
equity
loan
is
in
(i).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so,
in
fact,
if
i
have,
say,
a
balance
of
a
couple
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
home
equity
borrowing
over,
say,
10
or
15
years,
i
could
have
a
total
finance
charge
of
hundreds
of
thousands.
