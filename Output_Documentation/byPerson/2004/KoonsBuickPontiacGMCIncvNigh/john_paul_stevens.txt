john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you
right
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
did
the
word
subparagraph
describe
in
the
1974
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
subparagraph
(a).
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
small
(a),
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure.
you're
going
a
little
fast,
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i
follow
you.
during
the
period
between
1976
and
1995,
in
your
view
the
term
subparagraph
still
referred
to
capital
(a)
and
to
both
subparts
of
that
subparagraph.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
ayer,
does
your
opponent
agree
that
prior
to
the
1995
amendment,
the
word
subparagraph
in
the
(ii)
part
of
(2)(a)
referred
to
(i)
as
well
as
(ii)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
wait
a
minute
on
that.
was
that
true
before
1995?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
it
was
my
understanding...
you
correct
me
if
i'm...
you
say
there
are
just
two
cases.
my
understanding
is
there
are
hundreds
of
lawyers
who
have
practiced
under
statute...
under
this
statute,
and
it
was
generally
accepted
that
the
cap
in
not
subparagraph
but
clause
(ii)
did
apply
to
cases
under
clause
(i),
that
everyone
accepted
that.
and
you're...
you're
saying...
should
we
accept
that
as
a
starting
point
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
this
issue
would...
if
there
was
a
serious
question
about
that,
you
don't
think
that
there
would
have
been
a
single
case
that
would
have
arisen
between
1974
and
1995
that
made
the...
that
gave
this
interpretation
to...
i
want
to
call
it...
clause
(i)
and
clause
(ii)?
it
seems
to
me
most
improbable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
couldn't
have
involved
more
than
$1,000
if
people
read
the
statute
the
way
i
read
it.
that's
correct.
but
if
they
read
it
the
way
you
read
it,
it
seems
to
me
there
would
have
been
a
lot
of
cases
making
the
point,
and
they
all
would
have
had
to
assume
that
the
word
subparagraph
in
the
statute,
as
then
written,
merely
referred
to
clause
(ii).
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
that
applied
only
to
clause
(ii)?
that
there
was
no
cap
on
(i)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
your
position
would
have
even
been
plausible
before
(iii)
was
added,
if
the
word
subparagraph
meant
only
clause
(ii)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
is
true
if
you
look
at
that
footnote...
is
it
not
correct,
though,
looking
at
that
footnote,
that
the
statute
does
repeatedly
use
a
capital
letter
to
describe
what
is
clearly
a
subparagraph?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you're
saying
the...
we
should
read
this
as
though
it
said,
under
this
subparagraph
(2)(a)(ii).
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
you
get
actual
damages
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
you
get
actual
damages
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let...
let
me
just
make
sure
i
understand.
you
seem
to
have
taken
two
different
positions.
do
you
think
subparagraph
(i)...
i
mean,
clause
(i)
and
clause
(ii)
mean
the
same
thing
or
something
different
than
they
did
before
1995?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the...
did
the
1995
enactment,
which
added
clause
(iii),
did
that
change
the
preexisting
meaning
of
(i)
and
(ii)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
you're
agreeing
that
prior
to
the
1995
amendment,
your
opponent's
reading
of...
of
(i)
and
(ii)
would
have
been
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
ginsburg
has
an
opinion
to
announce.
