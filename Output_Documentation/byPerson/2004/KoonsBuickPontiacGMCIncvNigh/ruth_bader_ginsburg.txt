may...
may
i
stop
you
at
that
point?
because
you
did
introduce
this
neat
drafting,
the
set
of
words,
section,
subsection,
paragraph,
subparagraph,
and
clause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
had
you
introduced...
have
you
argued
before
the
fourth
circuit
those
drafting
manuals?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
argument
that
this
drafting
manual
that
you're
relying
on
for
the
meaning
of
paragraph,
subparagraph,
clause
wasn't...
what
was
the
year
it
was
published?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
the
argument
is
that
these
manuals
came
out
after
this
tila
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
believe
they
said
always.
they
said
congress
sometimes
doesn't
use
this.
sometimes
they
make
mistakes.
i
thought
they
said
this
is
generally
the
way
it
is,
not
that
it's
always
this
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
stop
you
there?
i
thought
you
could
get
actual
damages.
isn't
that
the
first
thing,
if
you
could
prove
actual
damages,
you
get
actual
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
all...
all
these
cases
are
cases
in
which
you
couldn't
prove
any
actual
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
blankingship
said
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
rare
that
under
tila
people
are
able
to
prove
actual
damages.
is
that
so?
justice

this

a
question

statutory
interpretation
thus
the

1995

statutory
damages
in

to
any

civil
liability
on
lenders
who
fail
to
do
so.
as
originally
enacted
in
1968
the
act
set
double
the
amount
of
the
finance
charge
as
statutory
damages
with
this
exception.
for
each
violation
congress
specify
the
minimum
recovery
of
$100.00
and
maximum
damages
of
$1,000.00.
congress
amended
the
act
in
the
1970's
dividing
the
statutory
damages
provision
in
two
clauses:
clause
(i)
sets
statutory
damages
for
long
transaction
at
double
the
amount
of
the
finance
judge,
and
clause
(ii)
set
damages
for
lease
transactions
at
25%
of
the
monthly
payment.
congress
retained
the
$100.00
floor
and
$1,000.00
dollar
ceiling
on
recovery,
and
courts
consistently
held
that
these
limits
apply
to
all
consumer
financing
transactions
whether
lease
or
loan.
in
1995,
congress
again
amended
the
act
by
adding
a
new
clause
(iii)
which
increase
the
limit
on
recovery
but
only
for
violations
relating
to
closed-end
mortgage
loans
commonly
home
acquisition
loans.
in
lieu
of
the
$100.00
minimum
and
$1,000.00
maximum
congress
substituted
$200.00
and
$2,000.00.

provision.
we
reverse
the
court
of

judgment
and
hold
that
the
1995
amendment
left
unaltered
the
$100.00
floor
and
$1,000.00
ceiling
on
recoveries
under
clause
(i).
less
than
meticulous
drafting
of
the
1995
amendment
created
and
ambiguity
the
phrase
prescribing
the
$100.00
floor
and
$1,000.00
ceiling
located
at
the
end
of
clause
(ii)
reads,
except
that
liability
under
this
subparagraph
shall
not
be
less
than
$100.00
nor
greater
than
$1,000.00.
congress
ordinarily
follows
a
hierarchical
scheme
in
subdividing
statutes.
the
word
subparagraph
generally
refers
to
a
division
preceded
by
a
capital
letter
the
word
clause

a
division
preceded
by
a
lower
case
roman
number.
the
three
clauses
at
issue,
all
in
lower
case
roman
numbers,
appear
in
a
subparagraph
preceded
by
capital
"a".
had
congress
meant
to
restrict
the
$100.00
floor
and
the
$1,000.00
ceiling
to
clause
(ii)
of
subparagraph
"a"?
it
likely
would
have
flagged
that
substitute
change
at
least
congress
might
have
stated
in
clause
(ii)
liability
under
this
clause.
the
statutory
history
cast
lie
down
on
congress's
meaning
the
$100.00
floor
and
$1,000.00
ceiling
from
the
start
have
applied
to
loans
in
the
clause
(i)
category.
the
new
clause
(iii)
removes
closed-end
mortgage
loans
from
clause
(i)'s
governance
only
to
the
extent
that
clause
(iii)
raises
the
minimum
and
maximum
recoveries.
there
is
scant
indication
that
by
raising
the
minimum
and
maximum
recoveries
for
mainly
home
acquisition
mortgage
loans
congress
meant
thereby
to
repeal
the
dollar
limitation
on
all
other
loans.
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
$100.00
floor
and
$1,000.00
ceiling
continue
to
apply
to
recoveries
for
truth
in
lending
act
violations
involving
loans
described
in
clause
(i)
and
leases
described
in
clause
(ii).
