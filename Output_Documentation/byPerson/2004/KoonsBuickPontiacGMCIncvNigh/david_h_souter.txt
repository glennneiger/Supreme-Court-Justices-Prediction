which
had...
which
had
two...
two
subparts--
justice
david
h.
souter
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
after
the
amendment
in
'76--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
described
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
even
if
we
don't
accept
that...
and
i...
if
you're
going
to
reach
this,
i...
i
don't
want
to
spoil
your
sequence,
but
even
if
we
don't
accept
the
rosetta
stone,
in
order
to
get
to
the...
to
the
position
below,
you've
got
to
read
subparagraph
to
refer
to
what
we
would
normally
call
a
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
the
difficulty
with
that...
that
the
point
that
i
raised
with
mr.
ayer?
to
take
that
position
before
the
most
recent
amendment
and
now,
you've
got
to
say
that
the
word
subparagraph
refers
to
the
section
of
one
sentence
which,
regardless
of
legislative
drafting
manuals,
i...
i
think
anybody
would
say,
well,
it's
a
clause,
and
to
call
a
clause
a
subparagraph
is
a
stretch,
at
least
in
the
absence
of
a
very
clear
provision
somewhere
in
the
statute
that
says
when
we
use
the
word
subparagraph,
we
include
clause.
that...
there's
a
basic
implausibility,
i
guess
i
find,
in
using
subparagraph
at
any
point
in
the
statute
to
refer
to
a
mere
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no.
it...
it...
that...
that
completely
leaves...
even
in
your
view,
that
leaves
open
the
question
whether
this
refers
to
a
clause
or
a
set
of
three
clauses.
it...
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
before
us
whether
subparagraph
means
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the...
you
can
look
at
that
either
way,
it
seems
to
me.
one
way
is
to
see
it
as
a
conflict.
there's
no
question
about
that.
another
way
is
to
see
it...
i
think
the
term
that
has
been
used
is
carve-out.
in
other
words,
the...
the
cap
on
damages
will
be
such
and
such
provided
that.
if
you
got
a
mortgage,
the
cap
is
going
to
be
higher.
you
can
read
it
either
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's
the
argument
for
your
reading.
there's
no
question
about
it.
but
it...
i
don't
see
it
as
an
argument
that
excludes
the
proviso
kind
of
reading.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
let's...
i
mean,
start--
justice
david
h.
souter
--start
from
your
own
analysis.
there's
something
very
odd
about
saying
that
when
there
has
been
a
violation
involving
a
mortgage
transaction,
you
can
only
get
$2,000,
but
a
violation
in
a
conventional
bank
financing
or
a
finance
company
financing
or
a
dealer
financing
of
a
chattel
transaction,
the
sky
is...
is
the
limit.
there's
just
something
very
strange
about
that.
most
houses
cost
more
than
most
cars.
it
is
odd
that
you
would
have
the
limitation
on
the
potentially
larger
damages
and
no
limitation...
or,
let's
say,
recovery
just
as
a...
a
generic
term...
but
no
limitation
on
the
damages
in
what
normally
is...
is
a
smaller
transaction.
how
do
you
explain
that
oddity?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
do...
they
happen
to
be
right
at
this
moment
in
the
business
climate,
but
that
is
not
the
characteristic
climate
in
which
this
act
has
operated
over
the
years
and
presumably
will
operate
again
as
interest
rates
start
their
way
back
up.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
there's
a
cap,
but
he's
still
going
to
get
more
money
than
he
would
be
if
exactly
this
same
kind
of
behavior
had
taken
place
with
respect
to
the
financing
of
a
mortgage
on
a
half
a
million
dollar
house.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
strange.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
getting
all
of
your
money
back
is...
is
presumably
going
to
make
you
whole
so
far
as
the
transaction
is
concerned,
and
we
have
to
assume
that
allowing
the
transaction
under
(i)
is
going
to
keep
you
whole
so
far
as
the
transaction
is
concerned.
the...
the
issue
is
what
do
you
get
in
addition
to
remaining
whole
or
steady
with
respect
to
the
value
of
the
transaction.
and
when
we
ask
that
question,
the
potential
for
recovery
under
(i)
is
significantly
greater
than
the
potential
for
recovery
under
(iii),
even
though
(i)
tends
to
be
a
smaller
transaction,
(iii)
a
bigger
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
your...
your...
there's
no
question
that...
that
in...
in
this...
in
the
case
of
your
client,
he's
got
problems
that
this
act
really
does
not
address.
but
the
question
what
we've
got
is
what
does
the
statute
normally
address,
and
i
still
find
something
anomalous
in
the
normal
operation
as
you
describe
it.
what
am
i
missing?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that
is
the
answer,
you're
still
left
with
the
situation,
as
i
understand
it,
in
which
the
recovery
under
the
small
loan
is
going
to
be
potentially
in,
i
suppose,
many
cases
practically
bigger
than
the
recovery
under
the
large
loan.
and
that
still
seems
cuckoo
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
a
question
which
you
are
free
to
decline
to
answer
because
it...
it
rests
upon
an
assumption
that
you
don't
make
but
the
fourth
circuit
did
make,
and
if
you
say,
look,
i
don't
want
to
defend
the
fourth
circuit
on
this,
okay
with
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
fourth--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the...
not
refuse
to
answer.
exercise
an
option
not
to
answer.
[laughter]
the
fourth
circuit
made
the
assumption
that
prior
to
the
addition
of
(iii),
the...
the
$100,000
minimum
and...
and
cap
applied
to...
to
both
little
(i)
or
little
(i)
and
little
(ii).
and
you...
you
have
argued
that
that
really
isn't
a
sound
assumption.
but
if
you...
if
you
start
where
the
fourth
circuit
did
in
making
that
assumption,
then
there
being
no
reenactment
of
(i)
and
(ii)
when
(iii)
was
added,
the
fourth
circuit
position
has
got
to,
i
think,
encounter
the...
the
general
presumption
against
repeals
by
implication.
and
on
the
fourth
circuit's
theory,
the...
the
threshold
cap
applied
to...
to
roman
little
(i),
and
without
any
reenactment
or
anything,
suddenly
it
no
longer
did.
there
was
no
express
provision
to
that
effect.
there
was
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
that
was
intended,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a...
a
difficult
repeal
by
implication
problem
here.
is...
is
there
an
answer
to
that
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
this
is
an
express
repeal,
you
win.
[laughter]
