m.

i
don't
know
whether
that's
any
more
profound
or
ultrareligious,
super
religious
than
the
prayer
that
the
chaplain
gives
every
day
in
the
house.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
i
haven't
read
the
prayer.
i
would
be
surprised
if
i
went
through
all
the
prayers
and
there
was
no
mention,
direct
or
indirect,
of
the
ten
commandments
or
a
couple
of
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
know,
in
the
first
amendment
speech
area,
we're
very,
very
strict.
a
moment's
delay
in
publication
is
a
constitutional
crisis.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
we
should
carry
that
over
to
this
area,
where
there
is
this
obsessive
concern
with
any
mention
of
religion.
that
seems
to
me
to
show
a
hostility
to
religion.
i
just
don't
see
a
balanced
dialogue
in
our
cases
or
in
these
kinds
of
arguments.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
classic
avert
your
eyes.
if
an
atheist
walked
by,
he
can
avert
his
eyes,
he
can
think
about
something
else.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
a
non
christian,
say
a
muslim,
comes
before
a
judge
who
has
very
strong
christian
beliefs,
a
very
religious
person.
does
he
feel
like
an
outsider?
and
to
require
that
we
pretend
that
there
is
no
religious
motivation,
no
deep
religious
conviction
on
the
part
of
many
of
our
public
officials
seems
to
me
to
be
a
hostility
toward
religion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you're
telling
us
the
state
cannot
accommodate
religion.
the
only
way
they
can
do
it
is
to
put
the
ten
commandments
up
and
insist
that
it's
always
secular,
whether
it's
predominantly
for
a
secular
purpose.
it
seems
to
me
that's
hypocritical
and
it's
asking
religious
people
to
surrender
their
beliefs
and
that
is
not
accommodation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
word
accommodate
should
not
be
within
our
jurisprudence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
another
case,
if
a
government
official
feels
that
the
ten
commandments
have
been
very,
very
important
in
his
or
her
life
as
a
spiritual
or
religious
matter
and
wants
other
people
to
know
how
important
the
ten
commandments
are,
he
cannot
accept
on
behalf
of
the
city
the
ten
commandments.
and
so
you
can
have
no
ten
commandments
in
city
a
with
the
ten
commandments
in
city
b.
general,
that
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
me.
and
again,
you're
just
doing
with
purpose
what
you
did
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question.
you're
asking
us
to
ignore
the
religious
purpose
that
is
the
most
manifest
value
of
these
symbols.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
endorsement...
in
england,
there
is
a
square
where
they
have
king
charles
on
one
hand...
on
one
end
and
he's
looking
at
oliver
cromwell,
who
beheaded
him,
on
the
other.
i
don't
know
if
you
have
to
endorse
one
or
the
other.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
you
think
that
it
should
cross
the
constitutional
line
under
the
interpretational
theory
of
the
first
amendment
you
wish
us
to
adopt?
