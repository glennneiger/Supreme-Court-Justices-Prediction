mr.
greg
abbott
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
every
court
that
has
reviewed
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
has
agreed
that
the
texas
monument
is
constitutional
under
this
court's
well
settled
precedents
in
lynch
and
allegheny.
this
court
should
agree
that
the
texas
monument
should
not
be
torn
down
from
its
historical
place
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
ten
commandments
is
an
historically
recognized
symbol
of
law.
second,
this
monument
is
one
of
the
smallest
of
the
17
monuments
on
the
capitol
grounds,
and
like
most
of
the
other
monuments,
was
a
gift
to
the
state
of
texas
and
is
clearly
recognized
as
such
on
the
monument
itself.
and
third,
this
monument
has
stood
for
more
than
40
years
without
controversy
on
a
national
historic
landmark.
in
fact,
even
the--
mr.
greg
abbott
--justice
stevens,
i
think
that
would
pose
a
much
greater
problem.
mr.
greg
abbott
i
seriously
question
whether
or
not
a
crucifix
would
be
constitutionally
acceptable
in
that
same
location,
and
for
the
very
same
reasons
which
i'm
articulating
why
the
ten
commandments
would
be
acceptable
in
this
location.
the
crucifix
is
not
like
the
ten
commandments
in
that
it's
not
an
historically
recognized
symbol
of
law.
it
doesn't
send
a
secular
message
to
all
the
people,
regardless
of
whether
they
are
believers
or
not
believers
of
the
important
role
the
ten
commandments
have
played
in
the
development
of
law.
mr.
greg
abbott
well,
justice
scalia,
the
ten
commandments
send
both
a
religious
message
and
a
secular
message.
when
people--
mr.
greg
abbott
--the
court
obviously
is
correct
to
accept
that
finding.
as
you
know,
from
the
district
court's
finding,
the
secular
purpose
that
was
accepted
by
the
district
court
was
to
honor
the
paternal
order
of
eagles.
but
also
there
was
an
ongoing--
mr.
greg
abbott
--i'm
actually,
justice
o'connor,
arguing
for
purposes
that
are
in
addition
to
that
district
court's
finding
because
there
was
an
ongoing
purpose
to
retain
this
now
historical
monument
that
has
stood
for
more
than
40
years
without
controversy
on
a
national
and
historic
landmark.
mr.
greg
abbott
well,
with
regard
to
both
purpose
and
effect
in
this
particular
setting,
i
don't
think
that
religion
was
the
driving
force.
i
know
that
all
of
the
evidence
shows
that
religion
was
not
a
driving
force
in
any
respect.
mr.
greg
abbott
if
i
may
clarify
an
important
fact
and
that
is
clearly
the
state
of
texas,
by
displaying
17
monuments
in
a
museum
like
setting
on
capitol
grounds,
is
trying
to
acknowledge
and
commemorate
certain
events.
it's
important
for
the
court
to
remember,
though,
that
the
state
of
texas
has
specifically
endorsed
nine
of
those
monuments
by
putting
the
state
seal
or
the
lone
star
seal
for
the
state
of
texas
on
those
nine
monuments.
this
monument
does
not
have
that
kind
of
endorsement
on
there.
mr.
greg
abbott
not
at
all.
that
is
very
true.
mr.
greg
abbott
justice
souter,
of
course
the
presumption
would
be
that
people
on
the
capitol
grounds
would
assume
the
state
of
texas
wanted
those
monuments
on
the
capitol
grounds.
mr.
greg
abbott
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
very
meaningful
difference
between
this
court's
standards
of
an
endorsement
and
what
a
state
or
the
nation
may
do
with
regard
to
commemoration.
as
an
easy
example,
on
the
national
mall,
there
is,
of
course,
the
lincoln
memorial
and
in
the
lincoln
memorial,
there
is
text
from
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible.
the
nation
commemorates
and
acknowledges
lincoln
and
what
he
has
said.
but
by
that
display,
the
united
states
is
not
trying
to
endorse
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible
or
a
particular
religious
message
in
that.
instead
what
the
state--
mr.
greg
abbott
--all
other
factors,
though,
justice
souter,
as
a
person
who
stands
in
front
of
that
monument
clearly
recognizes,
centered
in
a
specialized
scroll
is
an
indication
that
this
was
a
monument
that
was
dedicated
and
presented
to
the
people
and
the
youth
of
the
state
of
texas
by
the
fraternal
order
of
eagles.
there
is
no
stamp
of
approval
on
this
by
the
state
of
texas
on
that
monument.
mr.
greg
abbott
clearly
the
state
of
texas
approved
the
monument
being
on
the
grounds--
mr.
greg
abbott
--well,
where
i
believe
it
gets
you,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
there
is
a
very
meaningful
difference
between
acknowledging
something
and
endorsing
something.
for
example,
the
creche
in
lynch
or
the
menorah
in
allegheny.
mr.
greg
abbott
i
think
the
eagles'
disclaimer
on
there
helps
our
case
but
if
it
were
not
on
there,
i
think
the
monument
could
still
stand
just
as
the
creche
did
in
lynch
or
the
menorah
in
allegheny.
the
city
of
pawtucket
was
not
endorsing
the
creche
in
the
display,
it
was
acknowledged
as
part
of
the
overall
holiday
celebration.
mr.
greg
abbott
well,
just
as
this
court
may
display
in
the
courtroom
itself,
moses
with
the
ten
commandments
amongst
law
givers,
doesn't
mean
that
that
is
the
only
way
the
ten
commandments--
mr.
greg
abbott
--your
honor,
if
i
may
explain
with
two
points.
one,
there
is
a
common
theme
on
the
texas
capitol
grounds,
just
as
there
are
on
most
capitol
grounds
and
on
the
national
mall.
and
the
common
theme
is
to
recognize
historical
influences
in
our
country
and
in
our
state.
mr.
greg
abbott
well,
the
district
court
finding
obviously
chose
to
decide
that
the
secular
purpose
for
the
display
was
to
honor
the
fraternal
order
of
eagles
for
their
commitment
to
combatting
juvenile
delinquency.
but
that
is
different...
the
purpose
why
the
district
court
found
why
the
display
was
constitutional
is
different
than
the
message
that
is
being
sent
to
the
reasonable
observer.
mr.
greg
abbott
the
second
point
is
that
there
are
other
displays
in
this
court.
as
a
person
walks
into
this
courtroom
or
exits
the
courtroom,
they
don't
see
the
ten
commandments
in
a
display
with
a
bunch
of
law
givers.
instead,
they
see
the
ten
commandments
alone
with
an
eagle
above
it.
mr.
greg
abbott
justice
ginsburg,
clearly
the
ten
commandments
that
are
reflected
on
the
doorway
into
and
out
of
this
courtroom
don't
have
words
on
them
like
the
tablets
do
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
greg
abbott
we
do
and
that's
the
point.
even
more
importantly,
the
reasonable
observer
knows
what--
mr.
greg
abbott
--i
happen
to
agree
with
the
petitioner.
there
is
more
than
three
versions
of
the
ten
commandments.
and
the
purpose,
if
you
go
back
to
what
the
eagles
were
trying
to
achieve
here,
was
to
come
up
with
a
version
of
the
ten
commandments
that
wasn't
reflective
of
any
particular
religion.
mr.
greg
abbott
justice
stevens,
i
apologize,
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
disclaimer.
mr.
greg
abbott
a
disclaimer
like
that
would
surely
ensure
that
this
display
is
constitutional.
however,
it's
our
contention--
mr.
greg
abbott
--i
don't
believe
it
would.
mr.
greg
abbott
well,
this
court
obviously
has
decided
establishment
clause
cases
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
but
in
this
particular
instance,
the
ten
commandments
displayed
in
a
museum
like
setting
on
the
capitol
grounds
arrayed
among
17
other
monuments,
the
message
that
is
received
by
the
viewer
who
is
trekking
through
the
capitol
grounds
looking
at
monuments
is
clearly
one
not
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
greg
abbott
the
state
provides
a
walking
tour
guide.
mr.
greg
abbott
your
honor,
justice
breyer,
if
i
could
refer
you
to
page
205
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
provides
a
description
of
each
of
the
monuments
on
the
walking
tour.
and
if
i
could
also
refer
the
court
to
page
117
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
shows
the
actual
walking
tour
where
a
person
would
go
along
the
process
of
seeing
the
monuments.
but
clearly
as
they
walk
through
the
capitol
grounds,
what
any
observer,
not
just
the
reasonable
observer,
what
any
observer
would
notice
is
that
before
they
could
even
get
to
this
particular
monument,
they
will
have
passed
in
full
view
of
countless
other
monuments
and
historical
markers
clearly
indicating
to
them
that
they
are
not
there
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
just
the
ten
commandments
but
they
are
in
a
museum
like
setting
cast
amongst
many
different
kinds
of
monuments.
and
so
they
appreciate
the
setting
before
they
even
arrive
at
the
ten
commandments
monument.
also
when
they
arrive
at
the
ten
commandments
monument,
they
will
notice
it
is
one
of
the
smallest
of
the
monuments
on
the
texas
capitol
grounds.
it
does
have
the
disclaimer
on
it
indicating
that
it
was
donated
by
the
fraternal
order
of
eagles.
it
does
not
have
the
state
seal
on
it
like
many
of
the
other
monuments,
so
it's
not--
mr.
greg
abbott
--justice
ginsburg,
it
is
actually
not
clear
from
the
record.
there
have
been
some
accounts
of
hundreds,
maybe
even
into
the
thousands
that
the
fraternal
order
of
eagles
have
given
out.
and
i
cannot
tell
you
for
a
fact
that
they
are
all
identical.
mr.
greg
abbott
justice
ginsburg,
my
reference
was
to
the
fact
that
every
case
that
has
considered
the
specific...
every
court
that
has
considered
the
specific
facts
of
this
case,
meaning
the
texas
case--
mr.
greg
abbott
--no,
your
honor.
what
i
meant
is
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
specifically
reviewed
the
facts
of
this
case
and
were
all
in
complete
agreement
that
the
facts
of
this
case
render
this
monument
constitutional
under
this
court's
well
settled
precedents
in
lynch
and
allegheny.
one
other
thing
i
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
that
will
give
you
a
very
well
understanding
of
what
the
monument
looks
like
and
its
setting
is
the
videotape
that
is
exhibit
44,
it's
obviously
not
part
of
the
joint
appendix,
but
it
demonstrates
how
this
particular
monument
is
set
in
a
museum
like
setting
amongst
many
other
monuments
and
gives
you
the
perspective
of
what
the
typical
viewer
would
appreciate
as
they
walk
around
the
capitol
grounds.
mr.
greg
abbott
thank
you,
your
honor.
