justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
chemerinsky,
i
suppose
that
opening
statement
suggests
that
you
think
that
thanksgiving
proclamations
are
also
unconstitutional,
which
were
recommended
by
the
very
first
congress,
the
same
congress
that
proposed
the
first
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
also
refer
to
one
god,
to
a
theistic
ruler
of
the
universe.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
but
then
you
have
to
narrow
your
opening
statement
and
say
that
certainly
the
state
can
acknowledge
the
existence
of
a
unitary
god
without
offending
the
establishment
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
prayers
in
congress
doesn't
do
that
and
our
thanksgiving
proclamations
don't
do
that.
they
invoke
a
god,
a
unitary
god,
and
that's
contrary
to
the
dictates
of
some
religions
that
believe
that
there
are
a
lot
of
gods.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
pray
to
gods,
the
prayers
are
always
to
god.
you
know,
i
don't
see
why
the
one
is
good
and
the
other
is
bad.
it's
no
answer
to
say,
well,
you
know,
the
former
has
been
around
for
a
long
time.
well,
it
has
but
it
suggests
what
the
framers
and
what
our
society
for
several
hundred
years
has
believed
the
establishment
clause
means.
and
it
does
not...
it
is
not
too
sectarian
if
it
invokes
a
unitary
god.
now,
you're
saying
it
becomes
too
sectarian
when
it
invokes
the
ten
commandments.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
muslims
accept
the
ten
commandments.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
think
probably
90
percent
of
the
american
people
believe
in
the
ten
commandments,
and
i'll
bet
you
that
85
percent
of
them
couldn't
tell
you
what
the
ten
are.
[laughter]
and
when
somebody
goes
by
that
monument,
i
don't
think
they're
studying
each
one
of
the
commandments.
it's
a
symbol
of
the
fact
that
government
comes...
derives
its
authority
from
god.
and
that
is,
it
seems
to
me,
an
appropriate
symbol
to
be
on
state
grounds.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
a
profound
religious
message,
but
it's
a
profound
religious
message
believed
in
by
the
vast
majority
of
the
american
people,
just
as
belief
in
monotheism
is
shared
by
a
vast
majority
of
the
american
people.
and
our
traditions
show
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
government
reflecting
that.
i
mean,
we're
a
tolerant
society
religiously,
but
just
as
the
majority
has
to
be
tolerant
of
minority
views
in
matters
of
religion,
it
seems
to
me
the
minority
has
to
be
tolerant
of
the
majority's
ability
to
express
its
belief
that
government
comes
from
god,
which
is
what
this
is
about.
as
justice
kennedy
said,
turn
your
eyes
away
if
it's
such
a
big
deal
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
opening
of
this
court's
session
today,
in
a
manner
that
has
been
used
since
john
marshall,
is
that
divisive
because
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
don't
believe
in
god.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
are
you
kidding?
i
mean,
everybody
knows
that
comes
from
the
ten
commandments.
and
what
that
message
says
is
that
these
commands
that
are
engraved
on
the
human
heart
come
from
god.
why
put
it
that
way?
you
know,
instead
of
that,
just
quote
the
state
statute
against
murder.
that's
not
what
they're
doing.
they're
saying
these
basic
principles
of
human
behavior
that
we're
governed
by
come
from
god.
and
that
message
would
be
conveyed
so
long
as
you
use
the
terminology
of
the
ten
commandments.
that's
what
the
ten
commandments
stand
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
state
express
its
support
for
religion
generally?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
it
didn't
have
the
ten
commandments,
it
just
had
a
big
thing
that
says
religion
is
good.
it
said
religion
is
the
foundation
of
our
institutions.
suppose
there
were
something
like
that.
would
that
be
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
are
atheists
who
disagree
with
that
intensely.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
it
matter
whether
that
text
has
acquired
an
independent
meaning
of
its
own?
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
most
people
know
what
the
text
of
the
ten
commandments
are,
but
they
do
know
that
it
stands
for
the
fact
that
our
laws
are
derived
from
god.
that's
what
it
stands
for.
why
isn't
that
symbolism
sufficient
to
enable
the
state
of
texas
to
use
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
secular
message.
i
mean,
if
you're
watering
it
down
to
say
that
the
only
reason
it's
okay
is
it
sends
nothing
but
a
secular
message,
i
can't
agree
with
you.
i
think
the
message
it
sends
is
that
law
is...
and
our
institutions
come
from
god.
and
if
you
don't
think
it
conveys
that
message,
i
just
think
you're
kidding
yourself.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
know
what
they
are,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
version
is,
does
it?
if
it
just
stands
for
the
fact
that
laws...
the
foundation
of
our
laws
is
god.
if
that's
all
it
stands
for,
who
cares
what
the
text
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
do
it
and
we
wouldn't
have
this
case?
i
really
would
consider
it
something
of
a
pyrrhic
victory
if
you
win
on
the
ground
that
you're
arguing.
so
that
in
all
future
cases,
we're
going
to
have
to
examine
displays
of
the
ten
commandments
to
see
whether
there
was
ever
any
intent
to
say
that
our
laws
are
ultimately
dependent
upon
god.
is
that
what
you
want
us
to
do
case
by
case?
