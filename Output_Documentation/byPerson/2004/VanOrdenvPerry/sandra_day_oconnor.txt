how
about
if
they're
packaged
in
a
museum
like
setting
and
there
is
some
interest
on
the
part
of
the
state
in
preserving
something.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
displaying
a
whole
variety
of
things?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
a
kind
of
a
park?
what
do
we
regard
this
space
as?
what
is
it?
is
it
a
park
like
setting?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
it
be
all
right,
in
your
view,
if
they
put
several
others
up
for
different
religions?
then
is
it
going
to
be
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
object
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
the
depiction
on
the
door
of
the
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
but
if
the
legislature
itself
can
have
its
sessions
opened
with
a
prayer,
can
the
legislature
itself
want
to
have
the
ten
commandments
posted
within
the
legislative
halls?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
it
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
so
hard
to
draw
that
line.
if
the
legislature
can
open
its
own
sessions
attended
by
the
public
with
a
prayer,
you
say
it
cannot,
in
the
same
building,
display
the
ten
commandments.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
some
point,
would
the
state's
interest
in
preserving
old
objects
overcome
the
objection
constitutionally?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
did
this
monument
get
there?
was
it
in...
is
it
true
that
it
was
put
in
as
a
result
of
promoting
a
movie
about
the
ten
commandments?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
district
court,
i
think
in
this
very
case,
found
that
commemorating
the
ten
commandments'
role
in
the
development
of
secular
law
was
not
one
of
the
state's
purposes
in
accepting
the
monument.
don't
we
accept
that
finding
as
the
case
comes
to
us?
that
hasn't
been
challenged.
we
don't
have
any
cross
appeal.
i
assume
we
accept
that
finding
of
the
district
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you're
arguing
for
something
contrary
to
the
district
court's
finding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
that
every
monument
that's
on
the
state
capitol
grounds
in
texas
in
a
sense
conveys
a
message
of
state
endorsement,
state
endorsement
of
the
role
of
servicemen
in
fighting
earlier
wars
or
in
support
of
the
boy
scouts
or
whatever
it
might
be,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
by
placing
them
there
with
the
legislative
approval,
is
that
not
really
some
kind
of
a
message
of
endorsement
for
each
one?
