justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
now
hear
argument
in
van
orden
against
perry.
mr.
chemerinsky.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
supposing...
i
recently
read
a
case
from
the
seventh
circuit
on
what
they
did
in
lacrosse,
wisconsin.
and
as
we
all
know,
this
organization
has
donated
ten
commandments
monuments
all
over
the
country.
and
what
they
did
there
is
they
sold
the
parcel
back
to
the
eagles,
their
name,
and
put
up
a
sign
which
read,
this
property
is
not
owned
or
maintained
by
the
city
of
lacrosse,
nor
does
the
city
endorse
the
religious
expression
thereon.
now,
my
question
to
you
is,
if
there
were
a
similar
disclaimer
on
this
monument,
would
that
be
an
adequate
remedy,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
test
is
whether
the
reasonable
observer
would
think
that
the
government
is
endorsing
the
religious
message,
wouldn't
the
disclaimer
make
it
clear
to
the
reasonable
observer
the
government
was
not
endorsing
the
message?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
may
save
your
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
abbott,
we'll
hear
from
you,
please.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
under
your
analysis
of
the
reason
this
is
justifiable.
would
it
equally
be
permissible
to
have
a
crucifix
of
the
same
size
in
the
same
location
on
the
capitol
grounds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
my
question.
do
you
think
it
would
be
permissible...
it
seems
to
me
your
reasoning
that
you've
given
us
would
support
that
result.
and
maybe
that's
the
correct
result.
i'm
wondering
what
your
view
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
we
know
which
version
of
the
ten
commandments
it
stands
for?
there
are
three
different
versions
at
least.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
abbott,
would
the
texas
purpose
be
equally
served
if
the
monument
had
on
it
the
kind
of
disclaimer
that
the
city
in
wisconsin
put
on
its
monument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
reads
this
way.
what
they
did
is
they
sold
the
parcel
of
land
that
had
the
eagles'
donation
on
it
back
to
the
eagles
and
then
they
put
a
fence
around
it
and
then
they
put
this
sign
up,
"this
property
is
not
owned
or
maintained
by
the
city
of
lacrosse,
nor
does
the
city
endorse
the
religious
expression
thereon.
"
maybe
as
long
as
it's
still
on
the
property,
it
couldn't
be
the
same.
but
suppose
you
had
a
comparable
disclaimer.
would
that
defeat
any
of
the
purposes
on
which
you
relied
to
justify
having
the
statue
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
it
undermine
the
message
that
you
legitimately
seek
to
convey?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
abbott,
i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
argument
and
also
for
demonstrating
that
it's
not
necessary
to
stand
at
the
lectern
in
order
to
a
fine
job.
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
to
address
one
thing
that
troubles
me
about
the
case?
as
i
understand
it,
it's
the
protestant
version
basically
of
the
ten
commandments
we
have
before
us,
which
has
significant
differences
from
the
catholic
version
and
the
jewish
version.
and
i
understand
it
was
the
result
of
consultation
and
so
forth.
but
i
noticed
in
your
brief,
you
list
the
states
in
which
the
ten
commandments
displays
are
listed,
there
is
none
for
rhode
island,
which
i
often
think
of
as
primarily
a
catholic
state,
and
the
only
one
from
massachusetts
is
a
frieze
on
the
north
wall
of
the
public
library
which
apparently
didn't
have
the
text
of
the
commandments
in
it.
is
there
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
this
kind
of
display
may
be
more
popular
in
areas
of
the
country
where
the
protestant
religion
is
dominant
as
opposed
to
other
versions
of
christian
religions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
other
thing
that's
notable
about
your
listing
is
most
of
the
examples
are
examples
of
displays
of
the
event
itself
rather
than
the
text.
and
there
is
an
argument
made
i
think
by
professor
laycock
that
when
you
display
the
entire
text,
it's
kind
of
a
different
sort
of
symbol
than
when
you
just
have
a
symbolic
presentation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
symbolic
display
is
less
objectionable
when
quoting
the
text
as
this
monument
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
except
the
four
commandments
and
moses
would
avoid
the
differences
between
the
three
different
versions
of
the
ten
commandments,
whereas
when
you
quote
one,
you
must
select
one
over
the
other
two.
justice
john
paul
stevens
most
of
them
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
your
comment
be
on
requiring
a
disclaimer
of
some
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
kind
of
ambiguous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
chereminsky,
you
have
four
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
chereminsky.
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
now
hear
