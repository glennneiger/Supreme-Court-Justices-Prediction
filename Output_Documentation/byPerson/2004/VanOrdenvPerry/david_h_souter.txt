okay,
what
if
you
go
one
step
further
and
there
was
simply
a
tablet
without
any
embellishment
about
source
saying,
you
know,
thou
shalt
not
kill,
thou
shalt
not
covet,
et
cetera,
basically
just
the
last
five
commandments,
pure
and
simple.
would
you
have
any
objection
on
establishment
clause
grounds?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
just
talking
about
when
i...
i
don't
know
if
i
used
the
word
tablet.
i'm
just
talking
about
a
piece
of
stone
or
a
poster
that
says
thou
shalt
not
kill,
thou
shalt
not
covet,
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness,
et
cetera.
would
there
be
any
establishment
clause
objection
simply
because
though
it
does
not
say
so,
those
were
quotations
from
the
last
six
commandments.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
all
the
case,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
that
no
monument
is
going
to
be
on
the
grounds
of
the
texas
state
capitol
without
the
approval
of
the
legislature?
you
don't
dispute
that,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
don't
dispute
that
anyone
going
on
those
grounds
would
assume
that
the
state
government
approved
it
or
it
wouldn't
be
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
have
to
contend
with
the
fact
that
the
district
court
found
that
this
sort
of
commemoration
of
the
commandments
involved
was
not
the
objective
in
placing
the
monument
there,
so
you're
left
basically
with
a
religious
text.
and
if
anybody
has
any
doubt
about
that,
the
religious
text
is
surrounded
by
some
religious
symbols,
the
chi
rho,
the
star
of
david.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
hard
to
find,
if
we
accept
the
district
court
findings,
that
there's
anything
here
but
an
expression
of
approval
by
the
state
of
texas
for
a
religious
expression,
and
only
for
the
religious
expression.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
not
trying
to
withdraw
the...
i
took
it
to
be
the
concession
that
of
course
anyone
would
reasonably
assume
that
the
state
of
texas
approved
this
message,
and
thought
it
was
appropriate
to
devote
state
property
to
its
promulgation.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
then
the
fact
that
the
eagles
also
approve
it
doesn't
really
get
us
very
far,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
this.
if
the
eagles'
presentation
statement
weren't
on
there,
would
that
make
a
difference
to
establishment
clause
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the...
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
the
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
that
by
putting
the
ten
commandments
monument
on
grounds
that
have
lots
of
other
monuments,
that
the
religious
message
is
somehow
either
diluted
or
changed.
contrast
the
situation
in
texas
with
what
we've
got
here.
you've
got
moses
up
there
with
at
least
the
last
five
commandments
showing.
but
moses
is
in
the
company
of
a
group
of
individuals
who
are
nothing
but
law
givers.
you've
got
menes
and
hammurabi
and
john
marshall
and
the
rest
of
them.
there
is
an
obvious
theme.
anybody
who
looks
at
the
identity...
or
knows
the
identity
of
these
figures
is
saying
they're
getting
at
law
givers.
but
if
you
look
at
the
grounds
of
the
texas
state
capitol,
you
see
wars,
pioneer
women,
children
and
so
on.
there
is
no
one
common
theme.
the
only
theme
seems
to
be
these
are
objects
or
symbols
that
are
worthy
of
some
kind
of
respect.
and
one
of
them
is
religious.
being
mixed
into
a
group
that
has
no
common
theme
does
not
eliminate
the
religious...
the
obvious
religious
message
from
this
monument.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
it
doesn't,
but
i'm
trying
to
find
a
rationale
for
the
argument
that's
being
made,
and
that
i
thought
you
were
alluding
to.
the
argument
is
that
by
mixing
this
in
with
a
grab
bag
of
other
symbols,
you
have
somehow
diluted
or
changed
the
focus
from
a
religious
message
to
something
else.
and
i
can
understand
that
in
the
moses
case
in
the
frieze
because
there
is
a
clear
common
theme.
on
the
texas
grounds,
at
least
insofar
as
i
can
tell,
there
is
no
common
theme.
there
are
a
series
of
objects
that
say,
these
are
worthy
of
veneration.
one
of
them
is
religious.
there
is
nothing
that
removes
the
religious
message
from
its
prominence
in
the
display
the
way
the
religious
message
is
removed
from
prominence
in
the
moses
display,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
district
court
finding?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
had
a
second
point
and
i
don't
want
to
miss
your
second
point.
