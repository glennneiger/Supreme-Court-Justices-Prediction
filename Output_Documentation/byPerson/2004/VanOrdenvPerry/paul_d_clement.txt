mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ten
commandments
have
undeniable
religious
significance,
but
they
also
have
secular
significance
as
a
code
of
law
and
as
a
well
recognized
historical
symbol
of
the
law.
when
a
state
decides
to
display
a
ten
commandments
display
along
with
more
than
a
dozen
other
monuments
on
its
capitol
grounds
in
order
to
honor
the
donor,
it
is
not
endorsing
the
religious
text
of
the
ten
commandments.
and
in
the
same
way,
when
a
state
has
that
monument
as
part
of
such
a
collection,
the
establishment
clause
should
not
be
interpreted
to
force
them
to
send
a
message
of
hostility
to
religion
by
singling
out
that
one
monument
for
removal
solely
because
of
its
religious
content.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
so.
i
mean,
we
didn't
purport
to
do
an
exhaustive
survey,
but
i
think
there
is
a
well
represented
group
of
displays
throughout
the
country
including,
i
think,
in
states
that
probably
have
relatively
high
catholic
populations.
but
i
think
we
would
steer
this
court
away
from
attributing
too
much
significance
to
the
fact
that
if
a
state
is
going
to
display
the
ten
commandments
at
all,
it
will
necessarily
have
to
display
a
version
that
reflects
one
or
another
sect's
preferences.
in
the
marsh
case,
for
example,
this
court
upheld
legislative
prayer.
it
understood
that
they
would
necessarily
have
to
choose
a
chaplain
and
that
chaplain
would
necessarily
be
of
one
denomination
or
another.
and
this
court
didn't
doom
the
whole
practice
of
legislative
prayer
because
of
the
necessity
of
picking
a
chaplain
of
one
denomination
or
another.
in
fact,
in
the
marsh
case
itself,
this
court
upheld
nebraska's
practice,
even
though
they
had
chosen
the
same
presbyterian
minister
for
16
straight
years.
and
so
i
don't
think
this
court
in
other
establishment
clause
contexts
has
steered
away
from
putting
the
states
and
municipalities
in
a
catch
22.
and
given
that
this
court
has
suggested
even
in
stone
against
graham
that
the
ten
commandments
can
be
displayed,
can
be
used
in
certain
settings,
it
can't
be
that
once
the
state
in
practice
picks
a
particular
version,
it's
all
of
a
sudden
guilty
of
a
sectarian
preference.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
quite
a
few...
both
types
of
displays
and
i
think
the
very
fact
the
fraternal
order
of
eagles
put
a
lot
of
displays
out
suggests
that
a
bunch
of
them
are
textual
displays.
i'm
not
sure,
though,
that
a
display
that
actually
has
moses
receiving
the
ten
commandments
from
god
is
any
less
religious.
i
would
suggest
that's
actually
more
religious
than
one
that
just
displays
the
monument
standing
alone.
if
the
monuments
are
standing
alone,
you
can
i
think
appreciate
the
fact
that
maybe
they're
being
displayed
for
their
secular
significance
as
well
as
their
religious
significance.
when
moses
is
there,
it's
hard
to
avoid
the
implication
that
they
are
the
revealed
law
of
god,
as
opposed
to
also
a
secular
code.
so
in
that
sense,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
variations
in
the
display
take
away
from
the
fact
that
there
is
religious
content--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
would
say...
my
point
is
not
that
there
are
not
other
ways
to
display
it.
certainly
i
think,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
blank
tablets
or
tablets
with
roman
numerals
are
less
objectionable...
certainly,
i
think
they're
beyond
objection...
than
a
textual
display.
my
point
was
that
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
one
would
balance
sort
of
four
commandments
and
moses
versus
all
ten
commandments
in
text.
i
think
it's
a
close
call.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
that's
true.
i
mean,
some
of
the
displays
that
are
out
there
in
courthouses
have
moses
receiving
the
commandments
and
have
text.
and
i
guess,
my
point,
though,
would
be,
again--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--to
be
sure,
to
be
sure.
but
i
would
hope
the
constitutional
line
wouldn't
be
that
you
can't
have
text.
i
mean,
the
ten
commandments
have
a
role
in
our
society
and
had
an
influence
on
the
development
of
the
law
as
text.
i
mean,
they
weren't
influential
with
ten
roman
numbers.
they
were
influential
as
text.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg,
i
certainly
think
location
and
context
matters.
i
think
in
almost
every
establishment
clause
context,
the
setting
and
context
matters
a
great
deal.
the
school
case,
for
example,
as
you
suggest,
i
mean,
unless
this
court
is
going
to
revisit
stone
against
graham,
it's
certainly
true
that
the
school
context
at
least
raises
much
more
difficult
questions.
in
terms
of
where
it
can
be
displayed
in
the
courthouse,
i
think
there
are
certainly
permissible
displays
in
the
courthouse,
but
it
may
be
something
all
together
different
to
have
a
display
in
a
way
that
it
actually
looks
like
a
religious
sanctuary
within
the
walls
of
the
courthouse.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
putting
it
in
the
rotunda
of
the
court
as
a
stand
alone
monument,
giving
it
sort
of
pride
of
place,
if
you
will,
raises
a
much
more
difficult
question,
to
be
sure,
and
may
well
cross
the
constitutional
line.
as
i
was
alluding
to,
the
one
case
i'm
familiar
with,
which
is
the
case
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
there
it
was
displayed
in
a
way
that
the
district
court
literally
found
it
was
like
a
religious
sanctuary
within
the
walls
of
the
court.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
the
display
that
i
have
in
mind
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
probably
does
cross
the
constitutional
line
even
under
our
view.
i
think
that
a
display
of
the
ten
commandments
in
some
appropriate
way
in
the
courthouse
certainly
wouldn't
cross
the
line
that
this
court...
that
we
would
have
this
court
draw.
i
mean,
we
think,
for
example,
it
cannot
be
that
the
very
fact
that
moving
it
closer
to
the
courthouse
itself
is
a
constitutional
problem
because
as
you
yourself
have
pointed
out,
justice
kennedy,
the
legislative
prayers
that
were
approved
in
marsh
v.
chambers
were
at
the
absolute
epicenter
of
the
government.
and
still
those
were
a
permissible
acknowledgment
of
religion.
so
i
think
while
context
matters,
i
don't
think
solely
the
fact
that
it's
moved
closer
to
the
seat
of
government
does
have
a
dispositive
impact.
and
again,
i
would
say
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
remember
that
there
is
going
to
have
to
be
a
choice
among
the
various
documents
if
they
are
going
to
be
displayed
at
all.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
constitution
puts
the
municipalities
and
the
states
in
the
bind
of
being
able
to
display
the
ten
commandments
in
theory,
but
in
fact,
not
being
able
to
pick
any
one
version--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
stevens,
two
points
to
make
about
that.
one
is
certainly
a
disclaimer
would
make
this
an
easier
case.
and
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
a
disclaimer
of
sorts
on
the
monument
already
because
it
clearly
states
that
it
was
a
gift
from
the
fraternal
order
of
eagles.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
is,
justice
stevens,
and
i'm
troubled
frankly
by
the
suggestion
that
they
would
have
to
go
as
far
as
you
suggested
they
would
go
under
the
city
of
lacrosse
case.
the
idea
that
in
order
to
have
the
ten
commandments
monument
on
the
capitol
grounds,
the
state
of
texas
has
to
cordon
that
monument
off,
unlike
any
other
of
the
17
monuments,
suggests
a
hostility
to
religion.
i
think
the
idea
that
there
has
to
be
a
fence
away
from
the
ten
commandments
to
make
clear
that
the
state
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
ten
commandments
is
bending
over
too
far
in
the
other
direction.
the
state
can
have,
as
this
court
has
acknowledged
many
times,
permissible
acknowledgments
of
religion.
and
i
don't
think
in
this
case
that
the
state
of
texas
has
gone
too
far.
one
other
point
i
think
that
is
important
to
put
on
the
table,
and
it
is
consistent
with
the
analysis
of
both
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit,
is
that
whatever
the
original
purpose
is
for
texas
accepting
the
monument
and
displaying
it
in
the
first
instance,
they
now
have
an
additional
secular
purpose
in
retaining
the
monument.
and
i
would
point
this
court
to
judge
becker's
analysis
in
the
chester
county
case
for
the
third
circuit.
in
that
case,
he
had
a
display
that
was
admittedly
smaller,
but
it
was
actually
a
much
more
overtly
sectarian
version
of
the
ten
commandments.
it
had
the
ten
commandments
plus
the
summary
of
the
ten
commandments
from
the
new
testament.
and
nonetheless,
judge
becker
said
that
in
that
case,
the
monument
had
been
there
since
1920
and
chester
county
had
a
legitimate
secular
purpose
in
maintaining
that
document
and
maintaining
the
plaque
on
the
courthouse.
and
i
think
he
correctly
understood
that
in
these
cases
of
displays
that
have
stood
for
40
years
or
longer,
that
the
state
is
in
something
of
a
dilemma.
thank
you,
your
honor.
