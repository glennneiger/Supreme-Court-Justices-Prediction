mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
good
morning,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
the
grounds
of
the
texas
state
capitol,
there
is
one
evident
religious
symbol
that
conveys
a
powerful
religious
message
that
there
is
a
theistic
god
and
that
god
has
commuted
rules
for
behavior.
of
course,
the
government
may
put
religious
symbols
on
its
property,
including
the
ten
commandments,
but
must
do
so
in
a
way
that
does
not
endorse
religion
or
a
particular
religion,
but
does
not
have
the
purpose
of
advancing
religion,
but
does
not
favor
any
particular
religion.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor,
i
would--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
the
thanksgiving
proclamations
would
be
constitutional.
i
think
it's
analogous
to
the
legislative
prayers
that
this
court
upheld
in
chambers
v.
marsh.
i
think
it's
very
different
than
this
ten
commandments
monument.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
all
depends
on
how
it
is
done.
here
the
way
in
which
it
is
done
is
the
most
powerful
and
profound
religious
message
that
this
court
has
ever
considered
on
government
property.
here
you
have
a
monument
that
proclaims
not
only
there
is
a
god,
but
god
has
dictated
rules
of
behavior
for
those
who
follow
him
or
her.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
there
is
a
difference
between
a
prayer
that
a
chaplain
gives...
in
chambers
v.
marsh,
this
court
emphasized
that
the
prayer
by
the
chaplain
was
a
nonsectarian
prayer.
this
is
very
much
sectarian.
this
proclaims
that
there
is
a
god.
it
proclaims--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
i
would
be
surprised
because
here,
if
you
look
at
these
commandments,
it's
that
god
has
claimed
that
he
is
the
only
god,
prohibiting
idolatry,
prohibiting
graven
images,
prohibiting
taking
the
name
of
the
lord
and
god
in
vain.
requiring
observing
of
the
sabbath.
this
is
god
dictating
to
god's
follower's
rules
for
behavior.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no.
i
think
the
key
difference
is--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor.
there
are,
of
course,
other
differences.
as
i
said
to
justice
scalia
earlier,
with
regard
to
legislative
prayer
in
chambers
versus
marsh,
this
court
said
that
there
was
a
history
going
back
to
the
very
first
congress
that
allowed
there
to
be
those
kinds
of
religious
invocations.
ten
commandments
monuments
standing
by
themselves,
as
they
do
here,
certainly
are
not
of
that
historic
origin.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
of
course,
there
can
be
ten
commandments
or
any
religious
works
as
part
of
a
museum
setting.
this
isn't
a
museum
setting,
your
honor.
every
monument
on
the
texas--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--it
is
a
park
like
setting.
it
is
the
acres
of
the
state
capitol
grounds.
every
monument
on
the
state
capitol
grounds
is
there
because
the
state
legislature
wanted
to
convey
a
particular
message.
it
is
a
felony
in
texas,
an
impeachable
offense
to
put
anything
on
the
capitol
grounds
without
the
approval
of
the
legislature.
most
of
the
monuments
are
there
to
honor
war
veterans.
this
is
the
only
religious
message
anywhere
on
the
capitol
grounds.
and
by
itself--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--if
the
clear
purpose
and
message
was
to
honor
the
diversity
of
religions
in
texas,
it
would
then
be
permissible.
if
it
were
a
series
of
displays
like
that
frieze,
the
fifteen
different--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--quite
the
contrary,
i
think
it's
a--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--quite
the
contrary.
this
is
exactly
how
the
state
may
display
the
ten
commandments.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor,
there
is--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
several
things.
as
i
said
earlier,
first,
this
court
in
chambers
v.
marsh
said
that
there
was
a
unique
history
to
legislative
prayers.
there
isn't
a
similar
history
here.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
of
course,
justice
ginsburg,
the
venue
counts.
and
here
the
venue
is
very
important.
it
is
the
corner
between
the
texas
state
capitol
and
the
texas
supreme
court.
and
in
that
way,
this
monument
standing
alone
does
convey
the
government's
endorsement
for
religion.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
very
different
message
that's
conveyed.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor,
it
can't
post
the
ten
commandments
by
itself
in
its
legislative
halls
because
that
would
then
be
the
government
endorsing
expression
for
support
for
that
message.
it
cannot
be,
your
honor,
that
just
because
there
is
a
legislative
prayer,
that
any
religious
message
anywhere
on
government
property
would
then
be
permissible.
as
justice
kennedy
has
said
in
his
opinion
for--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--that's
right,
because
the
message
from
the
government
is
quite
different.
the
message
with
legislative
prayers,
as
this
court
found
in
chambers
v.
marsh,
is
a
recognition
of
a
long
historical
practice.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
ten
commandments,
it
really
is
different
than
even
a
legislative
prayer.
this
declares
not
only
there
is
a
god,
but
that
god
has
proclaimed
rules
for
behavior.
the
ten
commandments
come
from
sacred
texts.
as
justice
kennedy
said
in
his
opinion
of
county
of
allegheny,
certainly
a
city
council
could
not
put
atop
the
city
hall
building
a
large
latin
cross,
even
if
that
city
council
begins
every
day
with
a
prayer.
it
cannot
be,
though,
just
because
some
religious
messages
are
alllowed,
like
a
prayer,
that
everything
then
becomes
permissible.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there
should
be
an
obsessive
concern
with
religion.
if
the
ten
commandments
are
displayed
as
part
of
an
overall
display
of
law
givers,
like
that
frieze,
it's
permissible.
but
when
you
put
sacred
texts
somewhere
on
government
property,
then
the
message
is
that
the
government
is
endorsing--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
this
court
has
said
the
key
is
that
the
government
can't
endorse
religion,
in
a
way
that
makes
some
feel
like
insiders
and
some
like
outsiders.
imagine
somebody
who
is
muslim
or
buddhist
or
hindu--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--it
would
be
a
harder
case,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
an
adequate
remedy.
and
the
reason
is
the
city
cannot
put
a
religious
symbol
standing
alone
on
government
property
just
through
disclaimer.
that's
exactly
what
county
of
allegheny
was.
there
the
nativity
scene
in
the
courthouse
had
a
plaque
saying
it
was
donated
by
others,
but
that
can't
excuse
it
because
otherwise
the
city
could
put
the
large
latin
cross
just
with
a
disclaimer.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
think
the
disclaimer
would
make
it
a
harder
case,
but
i
think
when
you're
dealing
with
the
ground
in
a
texas
state
capitol
and
the
texas
supreme
court,
that
placement,
when
you're
dealing
with
the
ten
commandments,
sacred
texts,
i
still
think
that
the
message
the
reasonable
observer
would
be
that
this
is
the
government
endorsing
religion.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
at
some
point,
it
could
where
it
was
clear
to
the
reasonable
observer
that
it
was
there
because
it
was
an
old
object.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
the
record
is
unclear
as
to
that.
there
are
certainly
many
indications
in
the
popular
press
that
cecil
b.
demille
together
with
his
movie,
the
ten
commandments,
worked
with
the
friends
of
eagles
to
have
these
monuments
put
around
the
country.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
links
this
particular
monument
to
that.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
i've
tried
to
find
out
what
that
text
is.
it
is
not
in
hebrew.
it
is
not
in
a
script
that
anyone
was
able
to
recognize.
but
it
is
important
to
notice
that
if
you
look
at
the
entire
monument,
in
addition
to
the
ten
commandments,
there
is
also
a
latin
symbol
of
christ,
there
is
also
jewish
stars
of
david.
and
as
i
was
saying
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
imagine
the
muslim
or
the
buddhist
who
walks
into
the
state
supreme
court
to
have
his
or
her
case
heard.
that
person
will
see
this
monument
and
realize
it's
not
his
or
her
government.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor,
the
muslims
do
not
accept
the
sacred
nature
of
the
ten
commandments,
nor
do
hindus,
or
those
who
believe
in
many
gods,
nor
of
course,
do
atheists.
and
for
that
matter,
your
honor,
if
a
jewish
individual
would
walk
by
this
ten
commandments,
and
see
that
the
first
commandment
isn't
the
jewish
version,
i
am
the
lord,
thy
god,
took
you
out
of
egypt,
out
of
slavery,
would
realize
it's
not
his
or
her
government
either.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
disagree,
your
honor.
for
the
state
to
put
that
symbol
between
its
state
capitol
and
the
state
supreme
court
is
to
convey
a
profound
religious
message.
if
you're
just
saying,
now,
this
isn't
there
for
its
secular
reason.
if
someone
were
to
read
this
monument,
one
sees
that
it
emphasizes
its
religious
content.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
i
disagree,
your
honor.
because
this
court
has
said
that
above
all,
the
government
can't
make
some
feel
like
they're
insiders
and
some
like
outsiders.
even
if
they're
the
majority
religion--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor.
imagine
that
judge
put
the
ten
commandments
right
above
his
or
her
bench.
that
would
make
some
individuals
feel
like
outsiders.
of
course,
many
judges
have
religious
beliefs,
but
they
can't
have
the
religious
beliefs
above
them.
and
your
honor,
that's
not
hostility
to
religion.
as
this
court
said
in
county
of
allegheny,
excluding
religious
symbols
like
the
nativity
scene,
when
displayed
by
itself,
is
not
hostility
to
religion.
last
year
in
locke
v.
davie,
this
court
said
that
to
deny
funding
through
the
state
of
washington
for
scholarships
was
not
hostility
to
religion.
enforcing
the
establishment
clause
is
not
about
hostility
to
religion.
it
is
about
making
sure
that
every
person
who
walks
into
that
courtroom
can
feel
that
it's
his
or
her
government.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
test
that
this
court
has
formulated
do
draw
those
lines.
with
regard
to
your
point
about
divisiveness,
the
ten
commandments
is
enormously
divisive
right
now.
i
don't
think
we
can
ignore
the
social
reality.
the
chief
justice
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
resigned,
there
are
crowds
outside
today.
i
got
hate
messages
this
week,
not
because
people
care
about
the
ten
commandments
as
a
secular
document,
but
people
care
about
the
ten
commandments
because
it's
a
profound
religious
message.
and
many
want
that
religious
message
on
government
property.
and
i'm
saying
the
government
can
put
the
ten
commandments
there
as
part
of
an
overall
display
of
law
givers,
because,
justice
o'connor,
it's
an
overall
display
about
diversity
of
religion.
but
when
the
ten
commandments
sits
by
itself
it
is,
to
use
your
word
right
now,
enormously
divisive.
and
that's
why,
from
that
criteria,
it
does
violate
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
because
you
honor,
i
think
that
you
have
to
distinguish
between
minimal
religious
content
and
maximum
religious
content.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
the
first
of
the
two
tablets,
the
first
five
commandments,
your
honor,
and
of
course
religions
belief
this
was
written
in
god's
own
hand
and
given
to
moses.
it's
believed
that
the
first
five
commandments
that
you
were
referring
to
are
god's
prescriptions
for
religious
behavior.
the
latter
five,
the
others
that
you're
referring
to,
were
god's
commands
for
secular
behavior.
all
of
these
are
god's
commands
to
god's
people.
and
that's
what
makes
a
difference
than
the
minimal
religious
content
of
god
save
this
honorable
court
that
justice
scalia
was
referring
to.
the
core
of
texas's
argument
seems
to
be
that
it's
there
for
secular
purposes.
but
of
course,
if
one
looks
at
this
monument,
one
sees
that
it's
emphasizing
the
religious
content
and
there
is
nothing
that
would
lend
the
reasonable
observer
to
see
the
secular
content.
it
says
in
large
letters,
i
am
the
lord,
thy
god.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
your
honor,
if
it
was
moses
on
that
frieze
together
with
fourteen
other
symbols,
absolutely
okay,
because
it
would
clear
to
the
reasonable
observer--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--i
think
that
would
still
be
unconstitutional
between
the
texas
state
capitol
and
the
texas
supreme
court
because
it
would
still
be
the
state
of
texas
expressing
the
message
that
there
is
a
god
and
that
god
has
dictated
these
rules
for
behavior.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
if
the
tablets
were
by
themselves
in
that
way,
between
the
texas
supreme
court
and
the
texas
state
capitol,
it
would
be
a
harder
case,
but
i
believe
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional
because
those
tablets
do
convey
a
message
that
god--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--no,
your
honor.
if
all
it
said
was
thou
shalt
not
kill
and
thou
shalt
not
steal,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
a
problem
because
those
are
a
reflection
of
law.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
but
your
honor,
this
court
has
emphasized
that
content
and
context
matter
enormously.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
to
distinguish
the
situation
where
in
texas,
it
was
clearly
tablets
with
the
words,
i
am
the
lord,
thy
god,
with
five
commandments
for
religious
behavior
and
five
for
secular
behavior.
from
justice
souter's
question,
there
are
five
others
and
especially
those
that
are
reflected
in
state
law,
like
thou
shalt
not
kill
and
thou
shalt
not
steal.
i
think
that
the
message
is
different
there.
it
is
the
words,
i
am
the
lord,
thy
god.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
no,
your
honor.
i
do
think
that
it
degrades
religion
to
have
to
have
the
ten
commandments
defended
for
their
secular
purpose.
i
do
think,
though,
that
what's
required
of
the
government,
when
it
puts
religious
symbols
on
government
property,
is
to
not
be
endorsing
religion.
that's
why
a
nativity
scene
by
itself
in
the
county
of
allegheny
case
was
unconstitutional.
on
the
other
hand,
that's
why
the
nativity
scene
as
part
of
a
unified
display
in
lynch
v.
donnelly
was
permissible.
that's
why,
if
the
ten
commandments
are
part
of
an
overall
display
like
this
frieze,
it's
permissible.
as
part
of
an
overall
display
about
religious
tolerance,
and
that's
what
the
reasonable
observer
would
see,
it
is
permissible.
but
where
it
is
the
ten
commandments
themselves,
placed
as
they
are
here,
then
it
really
is
about
the
government
endorsing
religion,
then
it
is
the
purpose
of
advancing
religion
and
then
it
does
violate
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
accommodate
should
very
much
be
in
the
jurisprudence.
and
any
time
there
is
a
free
exercise
clause
claim,
then
there
has
to
be
careful
attention
to
accommodating
religion.
but
there
is
no
free
exercise
clause
claim
in
this
case,
your
honor,
so
this
isn't
a
case
about
accommodating
anybody's
religious
beliefs.
this
is
about
the
state
expressing
support
for
religion
with
sacred
and
solemn
religious
texts
on
government
property.
and
my
position
is--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--your
honor,
it
all
depends--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
problem
under
the
establishment
clause
because
it's
minimal--
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
--but
your
honor,
i'm
not
arguing
for
a
heckler's
veto
by
atheists.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
when
the
government
puts
sacred
and
solemn
texts
taken
directly
from
the
bible
at
the
core
of
its
state
government,
it
has
to
then
do
something
to
convey
the
message
that
it's
not
there
for
religious
purposes,
that
it's
there
for
secular
purposes.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
the
ten
commandments
monument
by
itself
conveys
the
message
that
the
ten
commandments
are
the
source
of
law
and
it's
that
message
the
state
can't
convey.
may
i
save
the
rest
of
the
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
thank
you.
mr.
erwin
chemerinsky
thank
you.
this
case
comes
down
to
two
questions.
first,
is
the
ten
commandments
a
highly
religious
message.
and
second,
can
the
government
place
a
single
religious
message
on
government
property
at
the
seat
of
its
government.
as
to
the
first
question,
stone
v.
graham
resolves
this
because
this
court
said
that
the
ten
commandments
is
an
inherently
religious
message
no
matter
what
disclaimer
accompanies
it.
the
ten
commandments
is
not
on
the
texas
state
capitol
grounds
simply
to
recognize
the
role
of
religion
in
government.
it
is
not
simply
an
acknowledgment.
it
is
sacred
text
taken
directly
from
the
bible.
it's
not
there
about
the
history
of
religion
in
texas.
there
is
nothing
to
tell
the
reasonable
observer
that
it
is
there
for
historical
purposes.
what
about
all
the
other
religions
that
have
played
a
role
in
texas
history?
the
mojave
religion,
even
madeleine
murray
o'hare.
is
texas
saying
they
would
accept
statues
for
all
of
these
individuals
there
as
part
of
the
history
of
texas?
the
second
question
is,
can
the
government
place
a
single
religious
message
by
itself
on
government
property,
especially
at
the
seat
of
government.
the
county
of
allegheny
case
resolves
that.
this
is
much
like
the
nativity
scene
at
the
seat
of
the
county
government.
what's
important
and
hasn't
gotten
enough
emphasis
this
morning,
this
is
the
sole
religious
message
anywhere
on
the
texas
state
capitol
grounds.
this
isn't
a
museum.
every
item
that's
there
is
there
because
the
texas
legislature
chose
to
put
it
there.
most
are
there
to
honor
veterans
of
particular
wars.
texas
put
this
there
precisely
to
express
the
religious
message.
your
honors,
what's
left
of
the
establishment
clause
if
any
item
can
be
displayed
with
the
most
profound
religious
contents?
do
we
then
say
the
observer
can
just
avert
his
or
her
eyes?
the
observer
could
have
averted
his
or
her
eyes
in
the
county
of
allegheny
case.
but
this
court
was
clear
in
saying
that
a
single
religious
message,
a
single
religious
symbol
on
government
property
is
inherently
an
establishment
of
religion.
for
this
reason,
the
texas
monument
violates
the
establishment
clause.
