is
there
any
other...
i
mean,
you
can
continue
if
you
want,
but
one
difference
which
i've
written
down
is
you
say
that
the
difference
between
this
and
the
prayer
is
that
this
is
more
profoundly
religious.
is
there
any
other
difference,
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
difference?
so
if
i
happen
to
read
these
prayers
in
the
congress
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
in
terms
of
a
religious
message,
i
actually
thought
the
prayers
had
the
more
religious
message,
then
i
should
vote
against
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
an
important
point
to
me,
but
i
don't
see
any
way
to
get
there
in
these
difficult
cases
without
making
a
practical
judgment
about
whether
that's
really
so.
and
the
reason
i
say
that,
i
start
with
goldberg's
opinion
with
harlan
in
schempp.
and
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
others,
but
i
don't
know
if
we've
found
a
satisfactory
test.
and
the
point
that
they
make
is
the
government
should
be
noninvolved
with
the
religious,
and
it
can't
favor
one
over
the
other.
but
at
the
same
time,
we
are
a
religious
nation,
where
most
people
do
believe
in
god
and
most
of
our
institutions
flow
from
the
religious
nature
of
our
people.
the
city
on
the
hill,
proclaim
liberty
throughout
the
land.
all
of
those
are
religious.
so
how
can
the
government,
without
what
they
call
the
pervasive
and
brooding
commitment
to
secularism,
which
they
think
would
be
wrong,
become
necessarily
involved
because
of
our
traditions,
but
not
go
too
far?
now,
i
come
to
the
conclusion
very
tentatively,
there
is
no
way
to
do
it
other
than
look
at
the
divisive
quality
of
the
individual
display
case
by
case.
and
when
i
do
that,
i
don't
find
much
divisiveness
here.
now,
i'm
exposing
the
whole
thing
not
because
i'm
accepting
it,
but
i
would
love
to
hear
what
you
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
got
to
get
one
question
before
you
leave
because
you're
the
one
who
knows
the
record.
and
what
i've
had
a
hard
time
finding
in
the
record
is
what
i
think
there
must
be
some
material
that
the
state
or
somebody
in
a
tourist
office
or
a
guide
or
somebody
tells
people
what
the
17
different
monuments
are.
and
all
i've
found
is
the
general
brochure
which
doesn't
tell
them
what
they
are.
and
i
found
something
on
the
internet.
well,
which
is
in
the
record.
but
aside
from
this
page
from
the
internet
in
the
record
and
that,
is
there
anything
else
in
this
record
that
if
somebody
wanders
around,
they're
on
the
state
grounds,
they
say,
what
is
this,
what
are
these
things
anyway?
there
must
be
something
to
tells
them.
and
where
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
brochure
doesn't
tell
what
they
are.
this
thing,
it
says
grounds?
