mr.
chemerinsky,
too,
doesn't
the
venue
count?
after
all,
we
have
had
the
question
of
prayer
in
schools,
and
the
court
has
said
that
that
was
not
all
right.
prayer
in
the
legislature
was
distinguished.
so
it's
not
just
prayer
anywhere
that
the
government
wants
to
have
it
is
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
the
display
on
the
tablets
on
the
top
before
you
get
to
the
text,
before
you
get
to,
i
am
the
lord,
thy
god.
i
thought
that
those
were
replicas
of
what
was
in
the
film.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
chemerinsky,
on
that
point,
how
much
of
the
ten
commandments...
i
mean,
once
we
get
to
thou
shalt
not
kill
or
murder,
then
there
are
tenets
to
govern
a
society,
but
how
much
are
strictly
about
the
obligation
that
man
owes
to
god?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
suppose,
mr.
chemerinsky,
it
was
like
moses
on
that
frieze
where
there
are
commandments
showing,
but
there
are
only
the
sixth
through
tenth
commandment.
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we
just
had
the
moses
with
the
tablet
that
has
the
instructions
for
how
people
will
conduct
themselves
in
a
civilized
society
versus
worshipping.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
see
blank
tablets.
they
don't
see
any
writing.
this
is
the
only
one
that
has
script
on
it.
it
has
numbers
and
in
fact
that's
confusing
because
one
of
them,
the
people
think
is
the
ten
commandments
is
the
bill
of
rights.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
like
how
many
other
monuments?
this
is
not
peculiar
to
texas.
the
order
of
the
eagles
have
given
how
many
monuments
just
like
this
one,
identical
to
this
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
said
that
every
court
that
has
considered
this
case
has
said
it's
compatible
with
the
establishment
clause,
did
you
mean
just
this
texas
case
or
other
cases
involving
an
eagles
ten
commandments?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
didn't
mean
this
particular
depiction
of
the
ten
commandments?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
kind
of
an
eclectic
museum.
one
message
that
you
get
is
that
the
state
is
honoring
the
donor
of
the
various--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
clement,
there
is
a
question
i
have
about
the
government's
position.
and
does
place
matter
at
all?
i
mean,
here
we're
talking
about
the
grounds
surrounding
a
state
capitol.
what
about
every
school
room,
if
that's
the
choice
of
the
school
board?
is
it
the
same
or
do
you
make...
or
every
courtroom
up
to
the
court
to
decide
for
itself?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
looks
just
like
this
monument.
let's
take
this
monument
and
put
it
in
the
rotunda
of
the
court
because
the
judges
of
that
court
choose
to
have
it
there.
is
that
all
right?
