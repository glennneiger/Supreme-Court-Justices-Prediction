justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
lamken,
it's
not
as
comprehensive
as
other
schemes
where
the
court
said,
on
that
basis,
we
would
not
find
a
section
1983
cause
of
action,
is
it?
i
mean,
it's...
it's
more
spare.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what...
what--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
would
you
think
of
a
case
where
the
plaintiff
alleges
that
the
antenna
zoning
was
the...
was
caused
by
racial
discrimination
against
the
applicant?
would
there
be
a
1983
cause
of
action,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about...
it...
it...
section
332
speaks
of
an
award
of
all
appropriate
relief.
what
does
that
include?
could
it
include
punitive
damages?
could
it
include
attorney's
fees,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it...
the
statute,
though,
is
silent
on
the
question
of
damages
or
attorney's
fees,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
we
infer
all
appropriate
relief?
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you...
do
you
think
that
any
other
provisions
of
the
communications
act
are
enforceable
under
1983?
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
332,
but
it's
a
big,
complicated
act.
are
any
of
the
other
provisions
enforceable?
