mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in...
by
its
clear
text,
section
1983
promises
redress
for
the
depravation
of
any
federal
right
in
any,
quote,
proper
proceeding.
and
that
expansive
language,
this
court
has
recognized,
dictates
a
heavy
presumption
that
its
remedies
apply
to
all
violations
of
federal
rights,
a
presumption
which
this
court
has
said
is
rebutted
only
in
the,
quote,
exceptional
case
in
which
the
statute
that
creates
the
right
is
accompanied
by
an
enforcement
scheme
that
is,
quote,
incompatible
with
or
inconsistent
with
1983's
remedies.
that's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
background
principle.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
that
the
way
this
court
has
interpreted
incompatibility
before...
in
the
two
instances
in
25
years
since
maine
v.
thiboutot
was
decided,
the
only
instances
in
which
this
court
has
found
incompatibility
has
been
where
use
of
1983
would
create
an
end
run
around
limitations
in
the
statute.
that
is,
in
the...
in
sea
clammers
and
in
smith
v.
robinson,
you
had
statutes
that
forestalled
an
individual's
access
to
court
via
an
administrative
regime
and
then
expressly
limited
the
judicial
remedies
that
would
be
available
once
they
got
there
by
requiring,
for
example,
only
injunctive
relief.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
now
i
have
two
points.
i...
i
don't
want
to
forget
these.
i
have
to
deal
with
the...
the
question
of
whether
a
30-day
requirement
is
inconsistent
and
whether
damages
would
be
inconsistent
with
what...
with
what
my
colleagues
posit
as
an
apa-like
administrative
review
model.
a
30-day
requirement
is
simply
a
reflection
of
congress'...
congress
confirming
expressly
that
somebody
who...
who
is
aggrieved
under
the
rights
provided
to
him
under
332(c)(7)
and
wants
any
judicial
remedy,
whether
it's
from
1983
or
otherwise,
has
to
go
to
court
promptly.
it's
precisely
what
1983,
this
court
said
in
patsy
and
felder,
guarantees
and
requires.
it
does
not
require--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
requires
that
the
court
proceed
expeditiously
and
courts
can
proceed
expeditiously
where
damages
are
sought
or
are
not
sought.
one
of
the
interesting
things
about
damages--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
think
that's
true.
in
fact,
i
think
this
case
is
a
pretty
good
example.
the
court
separated
it...
i
mean,
acting
under
a
requirement
of
expedition
at
the
request
of
the
city.
this...
the
court
didn't
even
begin
to
address
this
case
until
18
months
after
it
had
been
filed.
but
what
it
said
was--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
first
issue--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
it
first
issued
an
order
saying,
okay,
i've
construed
the
statute
and
i've
determined
that
the
statute
is
violated.
now
we
will
have
a
separate
proceeding.
then
the
city
will
conduct
itself
accordingly.
now
we'll
have
a
separate
proceeding
in
order
to
determine
whether
damages
or
attorney's
fees
are
available.
and
that
is
available
in
any
of
these
cases.
what--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
could
or
could
not
be,
and
there
may...
may
be
many
cases
when
damages
aren't
appropriate
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--what
he
said,
justice
ginsburg,
was
we'll
deal
with
what
other
remedies,
if
any,
are
available
and
to
what
extent
in
a
separate
proceeding.
as
it
turns
out,
he
concluded
in
an--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--for
sure.
he
said
that
i
don't
think
you're
entitled
to
this
because
i
think
that
the
statute
doesn't
allow
it.
and
therefore,
he
didn't
get
to
this
question.
but
the
point
about
damages...
i
think
there
are
two
points
that
are
very
important
they
not
be
obscured.
first
of
all,
the
government...
the
fact
that
the
government
and
the
petitioner
can't
agree
on
whether
the
statute
itself
provides
damages
relief
under
the
principle
of
bell
v.
hood
and
franklin
v.
gwinnett
county
certainly
shows
that
congress
did
not
speak
expressly
on
this
subject.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think...
i
think
that...
what
the
government
says
in
its
papers
is
they
may
well
be
available
and
what
mr.
feldman...
i
don't
want
to
misquote
him,
but
he
said
that
under
franklin...
he
agreed,
i
think,
with
what
judge
posner
wrote
for
the
seventh
circuit,
which
is
where
no
remedies...
where
no
specific
remedies
are
specified...
and
that's
the
case
here...
you
apply
a
rule
of
judicial
implication,
announced
in
bell
v.
hood
and
applied
to
an
implied
right
of
action
in
franklin,
to
apply
that
all
appropriate
relief
is
available.
and
damages
are
the
paradigm.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
the
irony
here--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
have...
i
have
two
different
ways
to
get
to
that.
first
of
all,
section
1983,
by
its
terms,
provides
redress
in
any
appropriate
cause
of
action.
it
also
supplies
a
cause
of
action
where
no
other
cause
of
action
is
available,
but
by
its
express
terms,
it
doesn't
exclusively
limit
its
remedies
to
causes
of
action
that
are
brought
under
1983.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
more
broadly--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
right.
it
provides
a--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
don't,
but
i
do
know
that
this
court...
first
of
all,
congress
has
now
enacted
section
1658
which
provides
a...
a
4-year
federal
default
statute
of
limitations,
where...
where
a
statute
like
1983
doesn't
provide
it,
but
includes
an...
an
introduction
that
says,
except
where
otherwise
provided
by
federal
law.
and
there's
certainly
nothing
in
that
language
that
says
when
you're
looking
at
whether
a
statute
of
limitations
is
otherwise
provided
by
federal
law,
you
look
to
the
very
statute
that
creates
the
substantive
right
that
1983
is
enforcing.
and
even
before
that,
when
your...
your
decision
in
wilson
v.
garcia
made
the
point
that
when
you
try
to
figure
out
what
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
a
freestanding
1983
action,
there
are...
there
is
a
tripartite
rule
of
construction
that
section
1988
requires
you
to
engage
in.
and
the
first
part
is
to
see
whether
there
is
any,
quote,
suitable
federal
statute
of
limitations.
now,
in
constitutional
cases,
like
the
one
that
was
at
issue
in
wilson
v.
garcia
or
under
the
social
security
act,
which
is
what
was
addressed
in
maine
v.
thiboutot,
there
were
no
express
causes
of
action,
much
less
any
express
statute
of
limitations.
and
so
this
court
said
you
then
go
to
the
second
rule,
which
is
what's
the
most
appropriate
state
limitations,
as
1988
requires.
but
the
anomaly
of
the
argument
here
is
we
have
a
background
principle
that
1983
is
available
and
there
is
a
heavy
presumption
that
it
will
be
available
unless
it
is
explicitly
incompatible
or
inconsistent
with--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
breyer,
this
is
not
the
apa
model.
this
is
not
a
model
of
administrative
review
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
one,
it
is
a
background...
there...
there...
it
is
established,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
this
statute
creates
individual
federal
rights
and
those
rights
were
violated.
and
the
background
rule
is
uniformly...
and
this
court
has...
has...
in
owens
v.
city
of
indianapolis
and
many
other
cases
has
reinforced
the
principle
that
damages
are
available
and
1983
is
available
where
federal
rights
are
violated
by
municipalities,
whether
it's
under
the
takings
clause
or
the
due
process
clause
or
the
equal
protection
clause
or
in
statutory
cases.
what
is
more--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
fcc
has
said
that
it
does
not
if
you
do
that.
in...
in
2000,
when
the
fcc
last
reported,
one
person
had
chosen
to
go
that
route
rather
than
go
to
federal
court.
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you
can't
go
to
the...
excuse
me.
i
didn't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the...
the
fcc
alternative
for
a
declaration
by
the
fcc
applies
to
only
one
of
the
five
rights
that
are
provided
here,
and
even
if
it
applied
to
all
of
them,
i
don't
think
you
could
possibly
infer
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--absolutely
not.
if...
if
there
were
an
instance
in
which
a
local
zoning
official
said,
you
know,
i
know
i'm
not
supposed
to
take
radio
frequencies
emissions
into
account,
but
i'm
going
to,
it's
denied,
i
would
have
the
right
either
to
go
to
the
fcc
and
say,
tell
them
no,
or
to
file
an
action
under
332
and/or
1983
and
say
that
violates
my
rights.
and
actually
your
example--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
i
just
may
finish.
your
example,
i
think...
the
example
of
this
particular
provision
points
out
that
what...
the
balance
of
what
i
was
going
to
explain
to
justice
breyer,
which
is
that
another
reason
why
this
isn't
the
apa
model
is
that
this
statute
includes
in
little
(i)
and
little
(ii)
substantive
provisions,
not
just
procedural
provisions.
you
can't
discriminate,
to
give
justice
o'connor's
first
example,
among
providers.
the...
that
was
a
complaint
in
this
case.
there
is
de
novo
review,
it
is
clear,
on
those
claims.
it's
not
administrative
apa
review
in
any
respect.
and
in
fact,
the
district
judge
in
this
very
case,
judge
wilson,
says
it
looks
like,
in
fact,
you
were
discriminated
against,
but
i
don't
need
to
reach
that
because
it's
clear
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
this--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
i
have
to
respectfully
disagree.
this
court,
in...
in
williamson
county
and
darby
and
many
other
cases,
has
distinguished
carefully
between
final...
final
action
and
exhaustion
of
administrative
review
or
judicial
review.
and
all
this
statute
requires
is
that
if
you
are
aggrieved
by
an
action
or
inaction
of
a
state
or
local
government
or
an
instrumentality
thereof--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
final
action,
this
court
has
explained,
does
not
import
into
it
exhaustion
of
either
state
administrative
or
judicial
remedies.
what
it
means
is
that
once
you
have
been
injured,
it's
a...
it's
a
ripeness
requirement
that's
familiar
under--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
am
entirely
certain
of
that,
and
in
fact,
the...
the
local
ordinance...
i
mean,
the
question
of
what
is
final
agency
action
is
surely
a
federal
question,
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
when
congress
addressed
this
problem
in
1996,
as
the
government
points
out
in
the
very
first
page
of
its
brief
and
as
the
legislative
history
reflects,
it
was
confronting
a
situation
in
which
intransigent,
entrenched
zoning
authorities
were
acting
arbitrarily
to
frustrate
the
creation
of
a
national
wireless
network.
and
it
was
so
concerned
about
this
that
the
house
actually
passed
a
provision
that
removed
this
paradigmatic
local
authority
to
the
fcc.
the
fcc
was--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--oh,
i
think
the
former,
for
sure.
i
mean,
the
notion
that
zoning
decisions,
siting
decisions
would
be
removed
entirely
from
localities
is
unbelievably
intrusive.
and
what
happened
in
the
conference
committee
was
a
compromise
was
reached
whereby
congress'
objective
was
going
to
be
achieved
by
creating...
by
leaving
it,
in
the
first
instance,
justice
kennedy,
to
local--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--let
me
just
say
this,
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
this
case,
justice
kennedy...
i
have
three
things
to
say
about
this.
this
case
is
every
bit
as...
as
paradigmatic
as
the
parade
of
horribles
that
they
suggest.
and
here's
my
proof.
it
has
been
since
1997
that
courts
have
been
ruling
that
1983
and
damages
are
available
under
this
statute.
there
is
no
evidence
in
any
of
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
or
any
of
their
amici
that
there
has
either
been
a
flood
of
litigation
or
inappropriately
large
awards.
and
if
that
happened,
congress
would
do...
would
be
attentive
to
it
in
the
way
that
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
when
the
local
cable
authorities
came
to...
came
to
the
very
same
committees
4
years
before
and
said,
we're
being
hit...
there's
an
express
right
of
action
in
555
of
the...
the
communications
act.
we're
being
hit
with
very
large
1983
awards.
please
do
something
about
it.
and
the
very
same
committees
4
years
before
enacted
a
provision
that
said
you
may
get
only
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief,
thereby
creating
an
incompatibility
with
1983,
as
the
legislative
history
expressly
provides.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
state
and...
than
state
and
local
governments?
i
hope
not.
but
here's...
here's
the
additional--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
point
is
that
congress...
justice
kennedy,
the
point
is
not
that
congress
was
being
inattentive
to
state
and
local
budgets.
what
it
wanted
to
do
what
was
this...
the
point
this
court
the
addressed
in...
in
stakura
and...
and
owens
v.
city
of
indianapolis,
which
is
to
enforce
a
federal
statute
through
privately
enforceable
federal
rights,
which
would
include
a
damages
remedy
that
both
provides
a
deterrent
against
conduct
that
had
provided
entrenched
resistance
to
a
federal
program
and
provide
compensation
where
reasonable
and
appropriate.
now,
this
court
has
made
clear,
with
respect
to
damages,
in...
in
carey
v.
piphus
and
other
cases,
that
there
may
be
very
many
cases
in
which
there's
a
violation
of
a
procedural
right
but
only
nominal
damages
are
available.
and
in
buckhannon--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
i
may
just
finish
this
sentence.
and
in
buckhannon
and
farrar
v.
hobby,
this
court
has...
has
recognized
that
in
order
to
get
attorney's
fees,
you
have
to
have
substantially
prevailed
and
a
court,
under
1988(b),
may
award
attorney's
fees
in
its...
may
award...
in
its
discretion
insofar
as
they
are
reasonable.
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
first
of
all,
justice
ginsburg,
i...
the
reference
to
those
two
senators...
what
those
two
senators
were
talking
about
is
not,
as
my
colleague's
brief
suggests,
this
provision.
they
were
talking
about
another
provision
of
the
telecom
act.
i
think
it
was
section
253,
but
i
may
be
wrong.
but
even
if
that's
the
case,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
whether
it
was
going
to
cost
them...
i
agree.
it
would
cost...
look,
a
regime
in...
which
left
all
of
these
siting
decisions
to
the
fcc
is
breathtaking,
and
it
certainly
would
impose
lots
of
costs
not
only
on
local
municipalities
to
have
to
come
to
washington
to
justify
these
decisions,
but
certainly
on
the
fcc,
which
would
have
to
send
an
army
out
to
example...
i
mean,
it
would
sort
of
like
be
the...
the
television
commercial,
you
know,
where
the
guy
is
walking
around
saying,
you
know,
can
you
hear
me
now,
can
you
hear
me
now?
the
fact
is
it
made
great
sense
to
continue
to
leave
the
initial
decisions
with
local
authorities.
but
congress
had...
was
frustrated,
expressly
frustrated
with
the
fact
that
the
prior
regime,
in
which
they
had
let
local
authorities
do
it
under
their
normal
routines
and
applying
the
normal
remedies,
was
not
getting
the
job
done.
that
was
the
imperative
of
this
statute.
and
in
the...
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence,
even
now
11
years
later...
or
i
guess
it's
10
years...
9
years
later.
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
of
a
flood
of
litigation
or
inappropriate
awards,
i
think
given
the
very
heavy
presumption
that
this
court
has
recognized
over
and
over
and
over
again,
that
1983
is
there.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
1983
is
the
background
principle
against
which
congress
legislates.
and
this
statute
either...
neither
provides
nor
excludes
any
remedies,
and
all
it
does
is
confirm
that
when
you
go...
when
you
are
injured,
you
can
go
to
court.
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to
be
sure.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the...
the...
you...
the
evidence
will
be
either
in
the
decided
cases
or
by
local
municipal
governments
coming
to
congress
and
saying,
this
is
too
heavy
a
thumb
on
the
scale.
but
what
we
know
is
that
if
you
afford
only
prospective
relief,
which
is
the...
the
ancien
regime
that
congress
was...
that
congress
felt
wasn't
doing
the
job,
it
provides
no
deterrent,
no
incentive
to
accomplish
what
congress
said
was--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--a
compelling
national
objective.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
kennedy--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
kennedy,
it...
under
their...
under
the
regulations
of
this
municipality,
which
is...
is
perfectly
representative,
it
is
final
agency
action
when
the
city
planning
commissioner
says
no,
unless
you
choose
to
appeal
it
to
the
city
council.
and
there
is...
not
only
is
there
nothing
peculiar
about
applying
1983
damages
awards
to
the
violation
by
a
state
and
local
government
of
an
express
federal
right,
assuming
you
can
prove
not
only
that
the
right
was
violated
but
also
that
you
were
really
damaged.
it's...
i'm
not
suggesting
that...
that
congress
had
damages
in
mind
specifically
and
only
to
deter
conduct.
you
have
said
in
a
variety
of
instances...
i
mentioned
stacura
in
particular...
that
1983
damages
do
serve
as
a
deterrent
to
violation
of
federal
rights
by
municipal
local
officials.
but
what
congress
had...
congress
had
to
come
up
with
some
way
to
confront
this
problem
in
which
there
were
sort
of
local
parochial--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
correct
impression
or
not.
our
brief
points
the
court
to
an
authority
that
at
least
9,500
of
the
entities
that
have...
have
created
antennas
or
tower
facilities
have
10
or
fewer
facilities.
and
one
thing
we
know
for
sure
is
that
when
congress
enacted
the
telecom
act
of
1996,
it
specifically
wanted
to
encourage
small
operations,
start-up
companies.
it
had
specific
provisions
in
the
law
to
give
special
treatment
to
small
entrepreneurs
in
order
to
foster
diversity
and
competition.
but
in
the
event
that
you--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
the...
the...
1983...
and
your
jurisprudence
shouts
this
as
clearly
as
it
does
any
other
principle...
stands
for
the
proposition
that
it's
there
unless,
in
the
explicit
language
of
the
statute
that
creates
the
right,
there
is
a
demonstrated
incompatibility.
and
that's
the
background
rule.
there
are
many
instances
in
the
telecom
act
and
elsewhere
in
which
congress
has
said
you
can
only
get
injunctive
relief.
you
may
not
get
1983
damages.
i
mean,
go
back
to
adickes
v.
kress
where
this
court
said
in
title
ii
of
the
public
accommodations
act,
congress
expressly...
expressly
precluded
damages
in
order
to
avoid
invocation
of
1983.
and
i'm
not
saying
that
congress
had
in
mind
my
client,
who
is
an
individual,
a
sole
entrepreneur,
who
was
subject
to,
i
think
what
the
record
shows
is,
prolonged
and
entrenched
intransigence
by
this
particular
municipality,
any
more
than
it
had
judge
posner's
example
in
the
seventh
circuit
where
it
was,
you
know,
verizon
v.
the
village
of
mequon.
but
this
court
has
recognized,
as
have
the
lower
courts,
that
you
only
get
damages
if
you
prove
that
you
really
have
been
damaged.
and
in
an
instance
where
there's
some
procedural
violation
and
a
remand
to
correct
it,
this
may
very
well
be
the
instance
of
carey
v.
piphus,
where
the
damages
are
purely
nominal.
the
agency
is
given
the
opportunity.
in
this
case,
the
city
never
said,
give
us
the
opportunity
to
go
back
and
correct
it.
and
judge
wilson,
a
very
level-headed
district
judge,
said
there's
nothing
to
go
back
and
correct
because
the
only
thing...
the
only
reason
that
the
city
gave
was
it
didn't
like
this
antenna
and
tower
in
the
first
place.
it...
we
concede
that
it
makes
no
difference
to
anybody
which
frequencies
are
being
broadcast
from
this
tower
that
we
approved
10
years
ago
and
have
no
right
to
modify.
and
therefore,
there
was
a
substantive
violation,
not
just,
you
know,
you...
you
may
have
had
substantial
evidence
but
you
didn't
lay
it
all
out
or
you
gave
your
reasons
at
length
and
orally
but
not
in
writing,
i'll
give
you
the
opportunity
to
go
back.
there's
a
line
of
cases
this
court
has
decided
under
the
social
security
act
where
there
have
been
remands
to
correct
procedural
errors
or
small
errors,
and
in
those
instances,
carey
v.
piphus
says
you
don't
get
damages.
and
under
buckhannon
and
farrar
v.
hobby,
you
probably
don't
get
attorney's
fees
either.
if
there
ever
is
the
sort
of
parade
of
horribles
that
they
protest
about,
even
a
small
parade
of
horribles,
congress
will
be
as
attentive
as
it
was
in
1992
when
the
cable--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--thank
you.
