justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
a
state
court
be
free
to
award
damages
or
would
that
be
preempted
under
the
view
you
take
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
state
court
allowed
damages...
if...
if
the
state
system
allowed...
state
law
allowed
damages,
would
the
federal
court,
in
an
action
under
this
section,
be
allowed
to
award
damages
under
that...
under
the
state
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
30-day
provision
is
inconsistent
with
the
award
of
damages,
but
after
i
say
that,
i
can't
tell
you
why.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
congress
said
specifically
1983
applies.
that's
all
it
says.
would
that
carry
with
it
attorney's
fees
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take...
you...
you
take
the
position
that
1983
doesn't
apply
at
all.
it's
not
just
attorney's
fees.
it's
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
would
be
more
burdensome?
that
enactment
or
subjecting
municipalities
nationwide
to
damages?
which
would
be
more
intrusive
and
burdensome
on
federalism--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
the
abilities
of
local
governments
to
function?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm...
i'm
not
so
sure
because
you're
arguing
that
even
the
smallest
municipality
can
be
liable
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
of
attorney's
fees.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--plus
other...
plus
other
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i...
i
don't
think
we--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
don't
think
we
usually
think
of...
of
judicial
review
of
agency
decisions
in
the
ordinary
course
as
being
a
deterrent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
an
opportunity
to
elaborate
reasons.
it's
a
safeguard.
it's
not
a
deterrent.
and
you're
saying
it
has
to
be
a
deterrent.
and
as
justice
breyer
indicates,
it...
it
means
that
there's...
there's
another
voice
in
that...
in
that
administrative
hearing
room.
they're
terrified
of
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
going
to
skew
the
decisions.
