justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
now
hear
argument
in
the
city
of
rancho
palos
verdes
against
abrams.
mr.
lamken.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
state
law
authorized
the
recovery
of
attorney's
fees?
would
they
be
recoverable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
state
law
authorized
the
recovery
of
attorney's
fees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
you
do
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
may.
mr.
feldman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
has
provided
for
them
for
a
1983
action,
and
if
it's
a
1983
action,
it
takes
care
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
is
kind
of
circular.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
waxman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
waxman?
i
don't
know
if
it's
really
a
legal
question
exactly,
but
i
have
the
impression
that
most
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
type
of
litigation
are
well-financed,
large
companies
rather
than
the
typical
1983
plaintiff.
and
therefore,
you
don't
need
the
attorney's
fee
incentive
to
be
sure
these
rights
are
protected.
is
that
a
correct
impression
or
is
it
incorrect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lamken,
you
have
about
4
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
the
case
is
submitted.
