mr.
james
a.
feldman
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
where
congress
creates
a
special
cause
of
action
for...
for
a
violation
of
a
federal
law
that
necessarily
carries
with
it
its
own
features
and
incidents,
congress'
decisions
about
the
appropriate
mechanisms
for
dealing
with
that
violation
of
federal
law
should
not
be
frustrated
or
overridden
by
allowing
a
1983
action
in
addition.
in
this
case,
section
332(c)(7)(b)(v),
which
creates
a
cause
of
action
for
violation
of
the
specific
standards
in
(i)
through
(iv)
is
an
independent,
standalone
cause
of
action.
if
1983
didn't
exist,
332(c)(7)(b)(v)
would,
undoubtedly,
still
provide
plaintiffs
with
a
mechanism
to
get
into
court
and
attain
redress
for
the
legal
wrongs
that
they
claim.
where
congress
has
taken
that
step
and
has
thought
about
what
the
appropriate
remedy
should
be
for
a
violation
of
a
particular
federal
statute
and
has
created
a
judicial
remedy,
then
it
would
only
frustrate--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
is.
it
doesn't
say
anything
expressly
about
either
of
those
things,
but
i
think
it
has
long
been--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--as
a
matter
of
damages,
i
think
all
appropriate
relief
would
be
the
standard.
but
as
a
matter
of
attorney's
fees,
i
think
is
a
good
example
of
why
there
shouldn't
be
a
1983
action
here
because
the
law
is
100
percent
clear,
from
this
court's
decision
in
alyeska
and
other
cases,
that
where
congress
hasn't
provided
for
fee-shifting,
there
simply
is
no
fee-shifting
authorized.
that's
what
they
intended.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
are
never
appropriate
unless
congress
specifically
provides
for
them.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
it's
circular
because
i
think
when
congress
created
the
specific
cause
of
action
here
in
(b)(v),
it
didn't
provide
for
attorney's
fees
and
therefore
intended
that
attorney's
fees
not
be
provided.
if
respondent's
view
in
this
case
were
accepted,
the...
the
presumption
would
be
exactly
flipped,
and
congress
would
have
had--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
i...
yes,
i
think
it...
i
think
it
would.
the
question
here,
though,
is
where
congress
has
thought
about
what
kind
of
remedy
it
wants
for
violation
of
a
federal
statute
and
created
a
judicial
cause
of
action
for
every
wrong
that's...
that...
that
can
exist
under
that
statute,
then
the
incidents
and
features
of
that
cause
of
action
should
govern,
not
the
incidents
and
features
of
1983
which
almost
inevitably
and
in
this
case
are
different.
and
attorney's
fees
is
just
the
best
example
of
that.
if...
under
respondent's
view...
when
congress
was
fashioning
this
statute,
it
certainly
was
aware
of
this
court's
decisions
that
have
repeatedly
said
that
attorney's
fees
are
not
available
unless
they're
expressly
provided
for.
and
indeed,
elsewhere
in
the
communications
act--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
but
it's
just
an
illustration.
there's
other
differences
between
the
provision
here
and
1983,
but
i
think
the
basic
point
is
that
where
congress
has
given
thought
to
the
remedy
for
a
particular
violation...
type
of
violation
of
federal
law
and
has
provided
for
a
judicial
cause
of
action,
with
whatever
features
and
incidents
it...
it
wants,
1983
shouldn't
be
allowed
in.
it
should
be
assumed
that
congress
didn't
want
to
have
its
decisions
frustrated
by
also
allowing
a
1983
action.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think...
i
think
the
same
rule
would
apply
to
any
of
the
provisions
where
congress
has
specifically
provided
for
a
cause
of
action
for
the
same
reason,
otherwise
congress
when...
here,
for
example,
just
to
return
to
attorney's
fees
for
a
second.
when
congress
was
framing
this
legislation,
they
knew
that
they
weren't
giving
attorney's
fees
and
this
332(c)(7)(b)(v)
would
be
construed
not
to
give
attorney's
fees,
but
not--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that...
i...
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
in...
i
think
the
rule
would
be
in
general
because,
first
of
all,
it's
not
just
remedies.
there's
other
incidents
of
a
cause
of
action
such
as
statute
of
limitations,
the
provision
here
for
expedition,
and
other
things.
and
really
when
congress
has
given
thought
to
what
remedy
it
wants
for
a
violation
here
of
(i)
through
(iv),
for
a
violation
elsewhere
in
the
communications
act
of
other
federal
standards,
it
shouldn't
be
assumed
that
they
all...
that...
to
allow
a
1983
action
would
just
frustrate
congress'
intent
in
fashioning
that
particular
remedy.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i
think
that
that's
completely
wrong.
when
congress
has
created...
has
recognized
a
right,
as
this
court
has
found
is
essential
for
a
1983
action,
and
it
hasn't
done
anything
about
providing
a
remedy
for
that
right,
hasn't
created
a
cause
of
action
in
court
in
particular,
then
that's
the
function
of
1983,
is
to
serve...
it
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
people
who
suffer
a
violation
of
that
wrong,
a
statutory
violation.
but
where
congress
has
given
thought
to
what
kind
of
relief
it
wanted
and
it
said
we
want
a
cause
of
action
with
these
such-and-such
incidents,
no
attorney's
fees,
30-day
statute
of
limitations,
expedition,
whatever
the
other
ones
are
here,
then
it
would
just
frustrate
congress'
intent
to
say,
oh,
and
also
you
get
a
1983
action
to
undo
all
of
the
things
that
congress
provided
for.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
and...
and
i...
whatever...
i
guess
the
general
point
would
be
whatever
remedial
decisions
congress
made,
those
should
be
respected,
but
i
would
add
in
this
case
it's
not
just...
it's
a
question
of
attorney's
fees,
which
they
would
have
had
to...
congress
would
have
had
to
do
something
very
unusual
here,
which
is
particularly
put
in
this
statute
no...
there
shall
be
no
fee-shifting
because
otherwise
you
can
always
go
to
1983
and
get
it.
in
fact,
even
if
they
had
done
that
in
332(c)(7)(b)(v),
respondents
would
still
argue,
well,
we
still
have
our
1983
action.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
we
don't
have
a
position
on
whether
it
does.
i
think
there's
arguments
both
ways.
i
would
point
out--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it
is
unnecessary,
and
in
fact,
i
think
it
shows
a
problem
with...
a
reason
why
our
view,
which
is
if
congress
creates
a
cause
of
action,
that
should
be
respected...
why
that
should
be
respected.
under
other
views,
you
have
to
look
at
the
1983
action
and
figure
out
all
of
its
incidents.
you
have
to
look
at
the
332
action
and
figure
out
all
of
its
incidents
in
the
abstract
as
here,
not
where...
in
connection
with
a
particular
claim
for
damages,
and
then
see
whether
they're
consistent
with
each
other.
i
think
the
much
better
rule
would
be
to
say
where
congress
has
created
a
specific
cause
of
action,
that's
what
it
wanted,
and
whatever
you
get
under
that,
you
get.
whatever
you
don't
get
under
that,
you
don't
get.
but
1983
shouldn't
be
used
to...
to
frustrate
congress'
intent
and
give
you
things
that
that
cause
of
action
wouldn't
to
give
you
a
longer
statute
of
limitations,
which
would
be,
i
think,
the
case
here,
to
give
you...
eliminate
the
provision
for
mandatory
expedition,
to
have
any
differences
in
damages.
another
way
to
put
it
would
be
under
the
court's
decision
in
franklin,
this
statute
gives
you
any
appropriate
relief.
all
that
1983
could
do
here...
it
maybe
gives
you
the
same
thing
which,
as
far
as
that
goes,
it
doesn't
matter.
but
all
it
could
do
otherwise
would
be
give
you
inappropriate
relief,
i.e.,
relief
that
congress
didn't
want.
and
instead
of
construing
the
two
statutes
in
that
way,
they
should
be
construed
harmoniously
and
in
accord
with
this
court's
decisions
which
have
set
forth
the
line
of
cases
where
you
have
a
right
to
get
into
court
in
wilder...
i'm
sorry...
in...
in
sea
clammers
and
smith
against
robinson
and
said
there
we
want
to
take
congress'
remedy,
however
simple
or
complex
it
is.
it
gives
you
a
complete
right
to
get
into
court
and
gives
you
whatever
it
gives
you.
and
that
should
govern.
and
then
the
other
line
of
cases,
which
is
wilder
where...
and...
where
it
says...
and
the
wright
against
roanoke
where
congress
didn't
give
you
a
right
to
get
to
court...
get
into
court.
in
those
cases,
that's
the
function
of
1983.
the
same
thing
would
be
true
in...
in
a
number
of
other
this
court's
cases
that
have
recognized
you
have
a
1983
action
when
congress
gave
you
a
right
and
didn't
think
at
all
about
the
remedy
because
that's
the
function
that
1983
was
supposed
to
serve.
if
there's
no
further
questions.
