stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure
why
that
would
be
if
you,
in
fact,
see
the
statute
as
trying
to
impose
an
apa-like
structure,
saying
to
the
states,
you
decide
the
substance,
we'll
give
you
minimum
elements
of
form,
which
helps
your
position.
then
if
the
minimum
elements
of
form
are
not
specifically
stated
in
the
statute,
there's
no
reason
to
interfere
with
the
states.
let
them
do
what
they
want.
only
those
minimum
elements
are
what
you
can't
do.
that
works
perfectly
for
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
strongly
supported
in
the
history.
it
may
lose
your
client
the
money.
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
you're
only--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--congress
didn't
care.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
congress
wanted
to
substitute
a
federal
judgment
for
the
judgment
of
the
states
where
it
said
so.
and
the
reason
you
know
that
is
because
that
is
what
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
other
things
are
either
neutral
or
negative.
don't
interfere
with
the
state
unless
you
have
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
how
could
that
be?
wouldn't
it
depend
on
whether...
when
you
look
at
the
particular
statute,
the
particular
set
of
remedies
that
congress
has
included
in
that
statute
could
be
absolutely
independent
of
1983
or
dependent
upon
1983
or
leaning
in
favor
or
leaning
against.
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
statute.
why
in
general?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
other
word
is
inconsistent,
and
is
it...
sorry.
were
you...
is
it
inconsistent
if
congress
didn't
want
it?
and
if
that's
insufficient
to
be
inconsistent,
then
here,
as
i
look
at
the
statute,
to
get
out
my
thinking,
i
think
that
it
sounds
like
an
administrative
law
statute.
if
i
saw
the
maintenance
and
cure
words,
i'd
think
it
was
an
admiralty
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
see
an
administrative
law
statute.
it
sounds
like
that's
the
system
they're
imposing
and
therefore
a
system
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
administrative
law
system
fails
and
1983
seems
to
fail.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
why
i'm
approaching
it
differently,
and
i...
i
want
to
get
your
view
on
it.
i'm
taking
the
word
inconsistent
and
i'm
using
that
as
a
guide
back
into
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
once
i
do
that,
i
find
congress
here
anxious,
i
think,
to
engage
in
what
i'd
call
cooperative
federalism.
they
could
have
run
the
whole
show,
but
they
said
we
don't
want
the
fcc.
we
want
each
city
and
town
to
do
what
they
want,
subject
to
a
few
minimal
procedural
requirements.
if
that's
right,
that
means
all
these
damages
questions
are
open.
all
kinds
of
things
are
open,
but...
and
we'll
decide
them
in
a
variety
of
ways,
maybe
deferring
to
the
state,
but
one
thing
is
true:
1983
doesn't
apply
because
that
is
a
different
set
of
remedies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
the
only--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
other...
the
other
harm
is
there
any
evidence
of
because
it's...
it
would
also
be
harmful
if
local
zoning
boards,
when
faced
with
quite
difficult
decisions,
because
the...
the
antenna...
they
bristle
up
and
you
put
them
in
the
wrong
place.
they're
environmentally
harmful.
they...
there
are
a
lot
of
bad
things,
as
well
as
good
things
about
them.
and
of
course,
it
would
be
a
bad
impact
if
we
discovered
that
the
zoning
boards
were
erring
too
much
on
the
side
of
granting
everybody's
application,
as
well
as
too
much
on
the
side
of
not
granting
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
i...
i
don't
know
how...
what
the...
there
won't
be
evidence.
how
can
we
get
evidence
on
such
a
thing?
