mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
whether
congress,
in
enacting
section
332(c)(7)
of
the
communications
act,
intended
to
expose
local
governments
and
state
and
local
officials
to
expansive
section
1983
liability
with
the
tens
of
thousands
of
wireless
antenna
zoning
decisions
they
must
make
each
year.
entitled
preservation
of
local
zoning
authority,
section
332
provides
for
state
and
local
agencies
in
the
first
instance
to
implement
specific
federal
substantive
and
procedural
requirements,
together
with
preserved
state
zoning
laws,
in
passing
on
applications
to
build
or
modify
wireless
towers.
it
then
provides
a
highly
distinctive,
independent
cause
of
action
for
accelerated
judicial
review
of
the
decisions,
including
a
short
limitations
period
and
mandatory
expedition.
that
tailored
process
is
sufficiently
comprehensive
to
evidence
congress'
intent
for
enforcement
to
occur--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it...
it
is
unusual
in
its
unique
focus
on
private
enforcement,
but
there
was
a
reason
for
the
focus
on
private
enforcement.
in
other
provisions
of
the
communications
act,
the
congress
chose...
for
example,
section
253,
congress
chose
to
eliminate
enforcement
at...
at
the
fcc
level
because
it
was
concerned
that
state
and
local
governments
often
wouldn't
have
enough...
excuse
me...
local
governments
in
particular--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--wouldn't
be
able
to...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
that
would
still
be
available
because
the...
the
section
332(c)(7)(b)(v)
only
provides
for
a
cause
of
action
for
violations
of
the
communications
act.
violations
of
the
constitution
continue
to
be
enforceable
directly
under
section
1983.
section...
section
332(c)(7)(b)(v)
is
comprehensive
in
the
relevant
sense
in
that
for
every
violation
of
section
332(c)(7),
for
every
person
adversely
aggrieved,
it
provides
a
mechanism
for
private
judicial
enforcement.
in
addition--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--in
that
respect,
it
is
indistinguishable...
for
example,
the
statute
that
was
at
issue
in
smith
v.
robinson,
and
it
doesn't
specify
the
precise
forms
of
relief
available.
in
our
view
in
this
case,
appropriate
relief
would
mean
specific
relief,
the
type
of
relief
that
is
traditionally
given
on
review
of
zoning
decisions
and
on
review
of
judicial
review
of
agency
action.
that's
supported
by
a
number
of
considerations.
i
should
point
out,
in
the
first
instance,
that
in
this
case
respondent
never
did
seek
damages,
or
punitive
damages
for
that
matter,
under
section
332(c)(7)(b)(v)
itself.
but
that's
supported
by
a
number
of
considerations.
first
is
the
structure
of
the
act,
which
presents
it
as
a
form
of
judicial
review
of
agency
action.
the
act
is
structured
much
as
you
have...
much
as
you
would
when
a
federal
agency
enforces
or
implements
federal
requirements
and
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
only
difference
is
that
congress
swapped
in,
effectively,
state
and
local
agencies
with
the
initial
implementers
in
place
of
the
federal
government.
in
that
respect,
it
shares
some
of
the
characteristics
of
sections
251
and
252
of
the
communications
act
which
are
also
implemented
by
local...
by...
excuse
me...
by
state
governments
as
opposed
to
the
fcc.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
justice
ginsburg,
that...
that's
an
example
where
congress,
for
a
broad
range
of
statutes
that
could
be
potentially
used
to
enforce
the
cable
act,
chose
to
restrict
the
forms
of
relief
available.
and
it
is
an
example,
in
the
words
of
sea
clammers,
where
congress
has
made
its
intent
explicit
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
congress
can
also
by
implication
limit
the
forms
of...
excuse
me...
limit
the
mechanism
for
relief
that's
available,
and
that's
our
position
here,
that
congress
by
providing--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
implication...
congress
has
provided
a
specific
mechanism
for
judicial
relief
here,
section
332(c)(7)(b)(v)
itself,
and
that
is
a
highly
adapted
mechanism
which
includes
unique
characteristics
such
as
a
very
short
limitations
period.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i'm
sorry.
in
terms
of
congress
making
damages
available
under
332(c)(7)(b)(v),
our
view
of
the
damage...
then
it
might...
damages
are
only
one
of
the
differences
we
think
that
exists
here.
but
our
view
is
supported
by
a
number
of
considerations,
in
addition
to
the
structure
of
the
statute.
for
example,
appropriate
relief
is
often...
is
the
traditional
form
of
relief
available.
in
this
context
traditional
relief
was
always
specific
relief.
congress
also
included
a
specific
savings
clause
that
extends
not
merely
to
federal
statutes,
but
prohibits
the
impairment--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--this...
that
comes
from
this
court's
decision
in
franklin,
that
where
congress
doesn't
specifically
identify
the
specific
forms
of
relief
available--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
it
isn't.
it
is
an
inference
the
court
draws
from
silence.
when
the
court...
when
congress
provides
an
express
cause
of
action
and
does
not
identify
the
specific
forms
of
relief
available,
the
court
will
infer
that
congress
intended
to
provide
all
appropriate
relief.
but
the
term,
appropriate
relief,
is
that
relief
which
congress
would
have
intended,
and
when
the
court
is
determining
that,
it
takes
a
look
at
what
the
traditional
forms
of
relief
are
and
it
will
look
at
things
such
as
the
savings
clause
in
601(c),
which
expressly
says
that
the
statute
should
not
be
read,
unless
it
expressly
provides,
to
supersede,
impair,
or
otherwise
modify
state
and
local
law,
as
well
as
federal
law.
and
in
order
to
put
damages
into
the
statute,
if
it
doesn't
provide
damages
expressly,
one
would
have
to
impair
myriad
municipal
immunity
laws
that
otherwise
protect
municipalities
and
state
and
local
officers
implementing
zoning
requirements
from
liability.
finally,
the
fcc
has--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
1983
is
expressly
preemptive
under
this
court's
decisions,
and
it
is...
it
would
preempt
the
state
laws
by
its
own
force.
but
we
believe
that
that
also
supports
congress'
decision
not
to
provide...
or
supports
the
conclusion
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
provide
section
1983
relief
here
because
the
effect
of
making
the
communications
act
enforceable
under
section
1983
would
be
to
expand
the
categories
of
claims
for
which...
that...
those
immunities
are
unavailable,
and
it
would
thereby
impair
those
immunities.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no.
they're
generally
immunities...
immune
from
damages
actions,
not
from
suits.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
oh,
i
think...
i
think
you
may
have
misunderstood.
the
immunity
is
not
from
suit.
it's
an
immunity
from
damages
and
the
impairment
would
be
the
immunity
from
damages.
section
332
is
not
designed
to
impair
the
municipal
immunity
statutes,
and
they
are
not
immunities
from
suit.
they
are
generally
from
damage
liability.
the
officers
are
subject
to
suit
because
these
are
subject--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
as
a
constitutional
matter,
they
have
an
immunity
from
suit,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
read
to...
to
override
the
state's
constitutional
immunity
to
suit.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
but
it
would
be
read
to...
it
would
be
read
to
override
immunities
to
suit
that
exist
under
state
law
because
otherwise
it
couldn't
be
affected.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
but
i'm
not--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
because
it
would
be...
it
would
be
a
provision
with
no
effect
whatsoever
if
it
didn't
override
immunities
to
suit.
but
i'm
not
sure
there
are
provisions
that
are
providing
for...
i
mean,
that
there
are
myriad
damages
immunity
laws
that
provide
municipalities
absolute
immunity
from
suit.
it's
fairly
common,
at
least
under
california
and
other
state
law,
for
municipalities
to
be
subject
to
suit
for
review
of
their...
of
the
actions
that
they
make.
and
that
is
the
typical
fashion
that
this...
this
statute
simply
incorporated
that
typical
fashion
of
providing
judicial
review
of
agency
action.
another
consideration
that
supports
the
view
that
section
1983
has
been
displaced
is
that
the
act
provides
an
entire
process
for
the
implementation
of
the
federal
statutes.
it
establishes
federal
substantive
requirements
that
identifies
the
agencies
to
implement
them.
it
provides
federal
procedural
guarantees,
apa-like
guarantees,
like
the
requirement
of
substantial
evidence,
like
the
requirement
of
a
written
decision,
like
the
requirement
of
a
decision
with
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
it
then
follows
up
with
a
mechanism,
an
adapted
mechanism
for
judicial
review.
in
that
sense,
it
is
very
much
like
the
statute
at
issue
in
smith
v.
robinson.
that
elaborate
process
is
particularly
significant
given
the
pattern
of
the
communications
act
as
a
whole.
the
communications
act
repeatedly
matches
specific
regulatory
requirements
such
as,
for
example,
the
common
carrier
requirements
in
202
and
203,
with
corresponding
mechanisms
for
private
enforcement,
such
as
an
action
for
suit...
i
mean,
an
action
for
damages
in
court
or
an
enforcement
action
in
the
commission
in
sections
206
and
207.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
the
action
can
be
brought
in
state
court
and
often
is.
there
are
about
50
reported
decisions
that
we
have
found
where
the
suit
has
been
brought
in
state
court.
i
haven't
seen
a
particular
pattern
between
the
choice,
but
congress
gave
the
option.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
state...
because
there's
an
express
preservation
of
state
law
in
this
context,
i
think
that
state...
states
would
be
free
to
award
damages
under
their
own
laws.
they
wouldn't...
whatever
relief
is
available
under
the
federal
statute
would
be
available
under
the
federal
statute,
and
state
courts
wouldn't
be
free
to
second-guess
congress'
judgment
as
to
what
relief
should
be
provided
under
federal
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
i
think
since
the...
the
provision,
the
savings
clause,
says
that
the
statute
should
not
be
construed
to
impair
state
law...
and
there
are
so
many
municipal
immunity
statutes
and
you
would
only
have
one
construction
of
the
statute...
i
believe
that
the
construction
would
be
an
across-the-boards
construction,
that
this
act
does
not
provide
damages
and
you
would
not
vary
from
state
to
state.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--if
the
state
law
provides
for
recovery
of
attorney's
fees
for
state
violations,
then
that
would
control
for
state
violations.
for
violations
of
federal
law,
the...
the
remedies
that
congress
chose
to
provide
would
control
and
the
states
would
not
be
permitted
to
second-guess
the...
the
remedies--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--justice
breyer--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
in
fact,
california
provides
a
municipal
immunity
for
permitting
decisions,
and
so
my
client--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--would
be
fine
with
your
position.
but
that
is
a
potential
inference.
my...
the
normal
view
would
be
that
where
congress
provides
a...
a
statute,
one
would
normally
presume
that
congress
intended
a
particular
set
of
remedies
to
accompany
it.
you
could
say
that
the
silence
is
meant
to...
meant
to
reflect
the
fact
that
congress
knew
that
these
would
be
enforced
in
state
courts,
as
well
as
federal,
and
it
would
allow
state
courts--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--to
use
whatever--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that
is
one
of
our
principal
contentions,
justice
breyer,
which
is--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
normal
procedure
is
either
under
a
uniform
state
law
or
california
law.
if
you
have
a...
an
entity
which
is...
excuse
me.
if
you
have
either
a
planning
commission
or
sometimes
there's
another
entity
that
does
the
initial
review
and
makes
a
determination
whether
to
grant
the
permit.
it
is
then
appealable
either
to
a
zoning
board
of
adjustment...
that's
the...
the
model
act...
or
in
california,
states...
localities
have
the
option
of
having
the
appeal
go
to
the
local
legislature.
that
appeal
is
then
reviewed...
is
then
determined.
and
finally,
once
you've
gone
through
that
process,
under
california
law
it's
generally
reviewable
by
a
writ
of
mandate,
although
other...
other
states
provide
review
by
writ
of
certiorari,
by
mandamus,
or
by
various
other
procedures,
almost
always
subject
to
a
short
limitations
period,
almost
always
short...
requiring
finality,
a
final
decision,
exhaustion
through
the
state
process.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
a...
a
form
of
specific
relief.
generally
they
have
the
authority
to
effectively
go
in
and
revise
the
decision
below,
but
the
remedies
ordinarily
do
not
include
monetary
or
compensatory
relief
i
should
say.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it's
very
much
like
that.
the
remand
rule
that
this
court
normally
requires
in
the
apa
context
is
not
so
strictly
observed
in
the
context
of...
of
review
of...
judicial
review
of
zoning
decisions,
but
it
is
very
much
like
apa
review.
that
is
what
prevails.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
actually
this
court's
decision
in
burnett
v.
grattan
actually
tells
you
why,
and
that
is
that
30-day
provisions,
which
are
typical
for
on-the-record
review
of
decisions
below,
are
often
insufficient
to
allow
somebody
to
develop
a
whole
new
record
such
as
their
proof
of
damages,
to
make
important
decisions
if
they're
going
to
have,
for
example,
a
jury
trial,
or
to
prepare
for
discovery.
and
that's
why
30-day
provisions
are
not
entirely
uncommon
in
the
area
of
judicial
review
of
agency
action,
but
they're
wholly
unprecedented,
for
the
most
part
that
i
know
of,
in
the
area
of
tort-like
remedies
like
section
1983.
if
i...
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i'd
like
to
make
only
two
brief
points.
first,
that
the
imposition
of
the...
of
damages
and
fees
under
section
1983
from
a
decision
in
this
court
for
even
good
faith
mistakes
in
the
implementation
of
the
antenna
siting
rules,
which
are
often
complex
and
uncertain,
would
be
a
welcome
mat
for
extensive
and
aggressive
litigation
and
the
imposition
of
extensive
fees
on
municipalities
which
simply
cannot
afford
to
enforce
their
zoning
rules,
the
rules
that
congress
expressly
attempted
to
preserve
in
the
statute
itself.
it
is...
in
this
case
alone,
for
example,
respondent's
most
recent
estimate
of
his
damages
and
fees...
and
this
was
before
he
retained
mr.
waxman,
i
might
add...
is...
is
$15
million,
essentially
the
city's
entire
budget
for
a
year.
and
respondent
claims
to
be
a
relatively
small
operator.
that
sort
of...
with
that
sort
of
liability
in
an
uncertain
area
of
law,
very
few
municipalities
could
ever
afford
to
stand
on
their
rights
to
enforce
local
zoning
even
when
they're
relatively
certain
that
they
are
right.
section
332(c)(7)
is
entitled
and
has
one
of
its
purposes
as
the
preservation
of
local
authority.
it
should
not
be
construed
to
provide
for
that
authority's
evisceration.
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
hit
is
that
when
congress
established
the
mechanism
for
review
in
332,
it
provided
a
very
adapted
mechanism
with
an
unusual
pair
of
characteristics:
a
very
short
limitations
period
and
mandatory
expedition.
this
court's
decisions
in
novotny
makes
it
clear
that
neither
of
those
requirements
can
be
simply
transferred
over
to
section
1983.
novotny
had
very
similar
language,
a
90-day
limitations
period.
the
court
did
not
transfer
that
over
to
section
1985(3).
instead
it
understood
that
the
general
rule,
the
general
federal
principle
of
law,
that
in
the
absence
of
an
express
limitations
period,
that
state
law
would
control.
wilson
then
confirms
that
rule,
as
an
interpretation
of
section
1988,
that
the
governing
federal
principle
is
that
state
law
controls
unless
there's
an
express
federal
cause
of...
statute
that
addresses
that
particular
cause
of
action.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
ask
only
that
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
be
reversed.
thank
you.
