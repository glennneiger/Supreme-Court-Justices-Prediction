justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
where...
where
are
you
getting
the
term,
appropriate
relief,
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
but
that's...
that's
not
in
the...
that's
not
in
the
text
of
this
statute,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
1983
is
not
subject
to
that
limitation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
are
they
only
immune
from
damages
action
or
are
they
immune
from
suit?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
i
mean,
that
proves
too
much
because
they...
the
statute
obviously
intends
to
eliminate
that
immunity.
the
immunity
from
suit
is...
is
clearly--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
allows
suit
against
either
municipalities
or
states,
state
or
local
governments.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
states
have
immunity
not
just
from
damages
but
from
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
they
have
chosen
to
waive
it,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
must
assume
in
this
area
they
haven't.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
regard
this
provision
as
intentionally
overriding
some
provisions
of
state
law
in...
inasmuch
as
they
apply
to...
to
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they've...
if
they've
waived--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if...
if
you
acknowledge
that
it
was
intended
to
affect
their
immunity
from
suit,
why...
why
would
we
suspect
that
it
was
not
intended
to
affect
their
immunity
from
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
this
action
have
to
be
brought
in
federal
court?
it
says
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
could--
justice
antonin
scalia
attorney's
fees
are
never
appropriate,
in
other
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
really
a
more
general
proposition
you're
urging
upon
us
then,
that
whenever
congress
creates
a
cause
of
action
that
is...
what...
in
any
respect
more
limited
than
section
1983,
the
background
action
of
section
1983
is
not
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there...
there
are
two
situations.
i
mean,
one
can
supplement
without
frustrating.
i
mean,
you...
you
could
say
that
in,
you
know...
in
some
respects
the
1983
will
contradict
the
action
that
was
provided,
but
one
can
conceive
of
a
provided
action
that...
that
grants
relief
which
1983
would
not
grant.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
about
damages?
do...
do
you
take
any
position
on
whether
the
communications
act
provision
enables
damages
to
be
collected?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it's
unnecessary
to
decide
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
they...
they
don't
necessarily
disagree.
the
government
just
says
the...
the
issue
doesn't
have
to
be
reached
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waxman.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waxman,
how
do
you...
how
do
you
get
a
reading
of
the
30-day
limitation,
which
is
applicable
to
the
cause
of
action
under
the
communications
act,
sucked
into
the
cause
of
action
under
section
1983?
i
mean,
if
the
suit
is
under
1983,
it's
under
1983.
there's
no
30-day
limit
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
require
you
to...
to
establish
a
cause
of
action
under
some
other
statute
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
not
at
all.
it's...
it's
self-contained.
and
do
you
know
any
case
where
we
have
read
into,
or
indeed,
it's
even
been
urged
upon
us
to
read
into,
section
1983
limitations
that
somehow
come
from
the
statute
that
was
violated
and
which
forms
the
basis
for
the
1983
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
they...
they
didn't
provide
for
the
normal
administrative
review
because
they
were
quite
aware
that
under
the
state
zoning
systems,
there
would
always
be
state
administrative
review
before
the
issue
even
comes
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
what
this
provides
is
what
kind
of
judicial
review
there
will
be
after
the
anticipated
administrative
review
before
the
zoning
board
and
whatever
appeal
from
the
zoning
board
exists.
justice
antonin
scalia
final.
final
action
or
failure
to
act
is
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--final
action
or
failure
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
been
injured
until
you've
exhausted
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you...
you
really
think
that
when
there
is
a
state
provision
available
for
review
of
the
zoning
board,
you
can
commence
an
action
under
1983
without
even
going
through
the
administrative
appeals?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
really
respecting
the
states,
which
is
what
the...
the
purpose
of
this...
of
this
whole
provision
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
cable...
cable
media
companies
may...
may
have
congress'
ear
more
readily
than...
than...
you
know,
than
the
municipality
of
whatever
this
is
or
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
i...
i
wouldn't
put
a
lot
of
money
on
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
imagine...
i
can't
imagine,
mr.
waxman,
that
congress
wanted
to
impose
damages
plus
attorney's
fees
upon
municipalities
without
even
giving
the
municipalities
the
chance
to
correct
their
mistakes,
which
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
the
municipalities'
appeal
system,
which
is
there
for
people
to
take
advantage
of,
is
just
washed
out.
one
mistake
at
the
lowest
level
and
you
get
damages
and
you
get
attorney's
fees.
that...
that
is
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
telecommunications
act
of
1996,
which
is
called
tca,
limited
the
traditional
authority
of
state
and
local
governments
to
regulate
the
location
and
construction
of
antenna
towers.
under
47
u.s.c.
section
332(c)(7),
state
and
local
governments
may
not
among
other
things
discriminate
among
providers
of
“functionally
equivalent
wireless
services”
or
take
actions
that
“prohibit
or
have
the
effect
of
prohibiting
the
provision
of
personal
wireless
services.”
they
must
act
on
request
for
authorization
to
locate
wireless
facilities
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
each
decision
denying
such
request
must
be
in
writing
and
supported
by
substantial
evidence
contained
in
a
written
record,
and
as
a
central
to
this
case,
section
332(c)(7)(b)(v)
provides
that
if
local
governments
fail
to
abide
by
these
provisions
“any
person
adversely
affected
may
within
30
days
commence
and
action
in
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction".
respondent
mark
abrams
is
a
resident
of
petitioner,
the
city
of
rancho
palos
verdes,
california.
throughout
the
1990s,
he
installed
several
radio
towers
of
up
to
50
feet
in
height
on
the
property
allowing
him
to
operate
contrary
to
zoning
laws
a
successful
commercial
radio
transmission
business.
in
1999,
when
the
city
discovered
that
respondent
was
using
his
antennas
in
a
commercial
business,
it
obtained
an
injunction
in
state
court
ordering
him
to
desist.
abrams
sought
a
conditional
use
permit
from
the
city
to
allow
him
to
resume
using
his
antennas
commercially
but
the
city
denied
the
permit.
thereupon,
abrams
filed
suit
in
federal
court
alleging
that
the
denial
of
the
permit
violated
the
limitations
placed
on
the
city’s
zoning
authority
by
the
tca.
he
contended
that
he
was
permitted
to
enforce
this
statutory
rights
and
this
is
the
significant
part
under
both
the
tca
itself
and
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983.
the
latter
provision
he
claimed
allowed
him
to
recover
as
the
tca
on
its
face
does
not
money
damages
and
attorney’s
fees.
the
district
court
agreed
with
respondent
and
city
was
not
violation
of
the
act
in
order
the
city
to
issue
respondent
a
permit.
the
court
did
not
agree
however
that
respondent
was
entitled
to
damages
or
attorney’s
fees
under
1983.
respondent
appealed
the
latter
holding
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari.
section
1983
imposes
liability
on
anyone
who
under
color
of
state
law
deprives
another
person
of
the
rights
guaranteed
to
him
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
we
have
held
that
this
provision
permits
suits
for
deprivation
of
rights
conferred
by
federal
statute
only
when
the
statute
creates
an
individually
enforceable
right,
and
if
the
plaintiff
makes
this
showing
the
state
act,
here
defendant,
may
still
demonstrate
that
1983
is
not
available
by
showing
that
congress
did
not
intended
as
a
remedy
for
the
newly
created
right.
evidence
of
such
intent
may
be
expressed
in
the
statute
or
as
we
held
in
cases
called
middlesex
county
sewerage
authority
versus
national
sea
clammers
association.
it
may
be
inferred
from
the
existence
of
an
alternative
enforcement
scheme.
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
the
tca
created
individually
enforceable
rights
in
respondent
and
the
city
does
not
question
that
determination
here.
the
critical
question
is
whether
congress
meant
the
judicial
remedy
expressly
authorized
by
the
tca
to
co-exist
with
the
alternative
remedy
available
under
section
1983.
we
hold
that
it
did
not.
the
provision
of
an
expressed
private
means
of
redressing
the
statute
will
ordinarily
indicate
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
leave
open
a
more
extensive
remedy
under
section
1983.
indeed,
the
existence
of
a
more
restrictive
private
remedy
has
been
redividing
line
between
those
cases
in
which
we
have
held
that
an
action
will
lie
under
1983
and
those
in
which
we
have
held
that
it
would
not.
nevertheless,
we
do
not
accept
the
government
suggestion
that
the
availability
of
a
private
judicial
remedy
conclusively
establishes
a
congressional
intent
to
preclude
1983
relief.
the
ordinary
inference
of
the
remedy
provided
in
the
statute
is
exclusive
may
surely
be
overcome
by
textual
indication
either
express
or
implicit
that
the
remedy
is
to
compliment
rather
than
plan
section
1983.
there
is
however
no
such
indication
in
the
relevant
remedial
provisions
of
the
tca.
section
332(c)(7)(b)(v)
adds
no
remedies
to
those
available
under
1983
and
limits
relief
in
ways
that
section
1983
does
not.
it
requires
aggrieved
persons
to
seek
judicial
review
of
zoning
decisions
within
30
days
of
a
final
action,
and
once
an
action
is
filed
that
mandates
at
the
court
herein
and
decided
on
an
expedited
basis.
the
remedies
available
moreover
certainly
do
not
include
attorney’s
fees
and
costs
and
may
not
include
compensatory
damages
a
question
on
which
we
do
not
rule.
a
1983
action
by
contrast
can
be
brought
much
later
than
30
days
after
the
final
action
and
need
not
be
heard
and
decided
on
an
expedited
basis
and
the
successful
plaintiff
may
recover
not
only
damages
but
reasonable
attorney’s
fees
and
costs
as
well.
in
sum,
if
a
plaintiff
could
enforce
the
rights
created
by
the
tca
through
section
1983,
he
could
whenever
convenient
circumvent
the
scheme
of
expedited
judicial
review
and
limited
remedies
created
by
the
act
itself.
for
these
reasons
and
others
expressed
in
our
opinion
today,
we
hold
that
the
tca
by
providing
a
juridical
remedy
different
from
1983
in
the
act
itself
precluded
resort
to
section
1983.
accordingly,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
o’connor,
souter,
and
ginsburg
have
joined;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
