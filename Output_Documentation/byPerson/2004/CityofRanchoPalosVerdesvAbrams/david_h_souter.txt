justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the...
what's
the
source
of
the
implication?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
by
implication.
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
the...
the
implication,
i...
i
guess,
is
that
unless
it
specifically
provides
for
damages,
it
implicitly
does
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
waxman.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
waxman,
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
the
best
argument
we've
heard
about
incompatibility
is
the
one...
or
at
least
i
think
the
best...
is
the
one
that
mr.
lamken
touched
on
at
the
tail
end
of
his
argument,
and
that
is,
he
said
there's...
there's
a
30-day
provision
in
there,
which
in
effect
says
congress
wants
this
litigation
conducted
fast
and
over
with
fast.
and
that
is
incompatible
with
a
damage
action
because
if
you
get
into
a
damage
action,
you
are
going
to
get
into
the
panoply
of...
of
damages
litigation,
including
depositions,
and...
and
the
one
thing
you
can
guarantee
is
that
it
is
not
going
to
be
over
expeditiously.
what
is
your
argument?
what
is
your
response
to
that
incompatibility
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
also
requires
expeditiousness
on
the
part
of
the
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
you...
do
you
agree
with
this
much,
that
if...
if
damages,
in
fact,
are
going
to
be
allowed,
what
is
going
to
count
as
expeditious
is
going
to
be
a
lot
slower
than
what
is
going
to
count
as
expeditious
if
damages
are
not
allowed.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
and...
and
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
was
a
violation
of
the
statute,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they
turned
the
damage
issue
basically
just
into
a
separate
remedial
hearing
at
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't--
