mr....
mr.
lamken,
the
argument
has
been
made
that
4
years
before
the
telecommunications
act
we're
talking
about
was
adopted,
congress
adopted
the
cable
tv
consumer
protection
act.
and
in
that
act,
it
specifically
limited
the
remedies
to
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
here
we
face
silence.
isn't
that
an
indication
that
when
congress
wants
to
limit
relief
to
declaratory
and
injunctive,
it
will
say
so
in
the...
in
the
measure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what,
mr.
lamken,
would
be
the
normal
procedure
in
the
state?
you
make
an
application
for
a
permit
to
a
zoning
board.
what
is
the
standard
operating
procedure
under
state
law?
suppose
we
don't
have
any
telecommunications
act
in
the
picture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
remedies
being
injunctive
and
declaratory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
it's
parallel
to
what
apa
review
of
an
agency
decision
would
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
feldman--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
how
would
you
ever
have
a
statute
that...
1983
provides
for
relief
when
there's
a
violation
of
federal
law,
statutory
or
constitutional.
one
of
briefs
in
this
very
case
says
that
your
broad
reading
means
that
you
were
doing
away
with
statute
as
a
basis
for
1983.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
was
just
to
decide
in...
in
the...
in
the
court
of
first
instance...
that
tail
end
was
not
to
decide
whether
in
this
specific
case
damages
or
attorney's
fees
were
due.
but
the
district
court
was
deciding
a
question
of
law,
that
is,
whether
in
this
kind
of
review
proceeding
anyone
could
have
damages,
anyone
could
have
attorney's
fees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
was
not
making
a
rule
for
this
case
only.
he
was
making
a
ruling
of
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman...
mr.
waxman,
one
of
these
provisions
gives
you
an
option
to
go
to
the
fcc,
the
one
having
to
do
with
emissions.
now,
if
you
sought
review
from
the
local
decision
to
the
fcc,
you
petition
for
fcc
relief,
would
the
fcc
have
authority
to
give
you
attorney's
fees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
that
an
incongruity
that
congress
would
say
you
have
your
choice?
complainant,
you
can
go
to
the
federal
agency,
the
fcc,
or
you
can
go
to
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if...
if
you
have
that
choice,
when
you're
dealing
with
the
radio
emissions,
to
go
the...
why
would
any
litigant
ever
do
that?
why
would
any
attorney
ever
do
that
if
you
don't
get
fees
at
the
fcc
and
you
do
get
fees
in
court?
wouldn't
the
presumption
be
that
it
would
work
the
same
way
whether
you
go
to
the
agency,
federal
agency,
or
federal
or
state
court,
that
you're
in
the
same
situation
as
respect
to
fees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
the
one,
that...
that
one.
are
you
saying
no
attorney's
fees
there
because
you
couldn't
get
them
at
the
fcc,
therefore
you
shouldn't
get
them
in
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
with
respect
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr....
mr.
waxman.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
in
this
legislative
record
a
concern
expressed
by
a
senator
from
california
when
there
was
a
proposal
on
the
table
to
make
the
fcc
the
federal
review
forum.
and
that
was
rejected,
if
i
understand
correctly,
because
there
was
a
concern
that
municipalities
would
have
to
travel
all
the
way
to
washington,
d.c.
to
defend
in
the
fcc's
forum.
and
congress
did
not
want
to
saddle
municipalities
with
the
cost
of
transporting
their
representative
to
d.c.
well,
that
cost
would
pale
compared
to
attorney's
fees
that
would
be
awarded.
