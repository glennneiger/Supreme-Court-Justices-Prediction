so
you
want
us
to
put--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
suppose
it
were
clear,
from
what
the
legislature
said,
that
the
only
purpose
of
this
legislation
was
to
help
out
some
local
dealers
who
were
politically
powerful
and
the
gasoline
prices
would
go
up.
i
assume
you
would
be
here
defending
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
would
be
here
defending
the
statute
on...
in
my
hypothetical
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you're
going
to
use
the
public
use
prong
of
the...
of
the...
the
constitution
for
what
we
think
are
regulatory
takings,
then
what
happens
is
you
just
invalidate
the
regulation.
you
don't
pay
compensation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
if
it's
not
a
public
use,
then
you
can't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
course,
when
you
have
a
physical
invasion
of
property
and
a
inverse
condemnation
is
tantamount
to
a
physical
invasion,
then
we've
built
up
some
doctrine
in
order
to
protect
the
concept
of
physical
invasion
so
that
that
can't
be
avoided.
perhaps
that's
not
applicable
to
a...
to
an
economic
regulation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
this
is
a
leasehold
interest.
i...
i
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
a
regulatory
taking
in
your
view
because
the
substantially
advances
test
is
not
met,
or
is
it
a
regulatory
taking
and
then
i
ask
if
it
substantially
advances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
i
know
this
is
a
regulatory
taking,
in
other
words?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
and
in
that
respect,
holmes
did
not
use
the
word
legitimate.
he
said
just
when
the
regulation
goes
too
far,
and
if
it's
illegitimate,
that
tends
to
show...
i
suppose
the
jurisprudence
is...
that
this
is
not
an
accepted
form
of
regulation
in
the
usual
course
and
therefore
unnecessary.
i
take
it
that's
your
argument.
