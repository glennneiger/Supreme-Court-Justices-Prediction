mr.
kneedler--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
substantially
advances
a
legitimate
state
interest,
which
does
sound
like
it's
a
higher
standard?
and
it
has
been
said,
as
was
pointed
out,
in
several
cases
of
this
court...
not
that
it
made
any
difference
to
the
bottom
line,
but
that
language
is...
sounds...
sounds
like
it's
a
more
toothful
standard
than
rational
basis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
don't
sound
like
synonyms.
so
i'm
asking
you
what
you
would
recommend
that
this
court
do.
if
you
say
that
the
standard
is
the
same
as
rational
basis,
perhaps
this
confusing
phrase
should
be
eliminated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
i'm
trying
to
understand
not
your
theory
but
its
concrete
applications.
here
we're
dealing
with
the
rent
to
be
paid
by
a
lessee
of
a
gas
station,
but
what
you're
saying,
i
take
it,
would
go
for
any
kind
of
rent
control.
you
could
make
the
same
argument.
so
you're...
so
you
are
saying
that
rent
control
is
a
taking
and
the
state
could
do
it
with
compensation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
the
measure
of
compensation
would
be?
how
would
the
state...
let's
take
a...
an
ordinary
rental
property,
and
the
city
puts
a
rent
control
ordinance
into
effect.
you
say
that's
a
taking,
and
how
would
one
measure
the
compensation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
for
not
the
state's
position
but
your
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
let's...
let's
assume
that
there's
no
better
reason
for
the
rent
control
for
the
building,
residential
building,
than
there
is
for
the
rent
control
on
the
lease
for
the
gas
station.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
the
effect
of
what
you're
arguing
that
you
can't
do
it?
because
you...
the
government
would
have
to
pay
the
same
amount
that...
by
the...
that
the
rent
is
being
reduced.
we'd
have
to
figure
out
how
much
higher
the
rent
would
have
been,
and...
so
it...
it
would
be
a...
a
nonsensical
thing
for
the
government
to
engage
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
wouldn't
it
make
sense
then
for
the
government
to
say,
chevron,
you
charge
what
you
want
and,
station
owner,
we,
the
government,
gives
you...
hawaii
gives
you
this
money
so
you'll
be
able
to
pay
the
excess
rent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
are
so
many
things
that
you
could
dress
up
as
being
a
taking.
and...
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
up
to
the
artful
pleader
to
say
whether
this
is
a
due
process
excessive
regulation
or
this
is
intrusive
to
the
point
where
it
amounts
to
a
taking.
i
mean,
the...
the...
would
you...
rent
control
is
one.
what
about...
suppose
hawaii
had
said,
we're
going
to
cap
the
price
of
gas
so
it
will
make
it
easier
for
these
stations
to
survive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
a
case
involving
price
control
where
we
have
analyzed
that
as
a
taking?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
know
that
those
were
treated
as
taking
cases.
