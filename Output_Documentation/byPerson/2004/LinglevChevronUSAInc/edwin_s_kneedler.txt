mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
justice
o'connor,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
reasons
why
this
court
has
applied
the
rational
basis
standard
to
review
economic
legislation
of
the
sort
involved
here
go
to
the
heart
of
the
role
of
courts
in
our
democratic
society.
legislatures,
not
courts,
are
elected
to
enact
the
laws,
and
courts,
therefore,
do
not
substitute
their
judgment
for
the
economic
wisdom
of
legislation
for
that
of
the
legislature.
and
courts
typically
lack
the
fact-finding
ability
and
expertise
of
legislatures,
especially
to
make
the
sort
of
predictive
judgments
that
the
ninth
circuit
relied
upon
in
this
case.
these
fundamental
principles
about
the
role
of
courts
in
our
society
would
be
greatly
undermined
if
a
plaintiff
could
simply...
could
obtain
heightened
scrutiny
of
legislation
by
simply
recasting
his
claim
as
a
takings
claim.
and
therefore,
it's
not
surprising
that
this
notion
doesn't
find
support
in
the
just
compensation
clause.
when
the
government
affirmatively
exercises
the
power
of
eminent
domain
to
take
property,
the
requirement
that
compensation
be
paid
doesn't
rest
on
the
proposition
that
the
legislation
is
ineffective.
to
the
contrary,
the
taking
presupposes
that
the...
that
the
action
will...
will
further
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose
or
at
least
that
the
legislature
could
have
rationally
so
concluded.
any
inquiry
into
the
legitimacy
of
the
governmental
purpose
or
whether
it
will
be
served,
instead,
arises
under
the
public
use
clause,
not
whether
there
is
a
taking.
and
if
those
purposes
are
not
served
or
the
legislature
could
not
rationally
so
conclude,
it
is
not
a
public
use
and
it's
invalid
and
it
should
be
enjoined,
the
consequences
not
to
trigger
the
payment
of...
of
compensation.
and
the...
the
same
analytical
approach
applies
for
regulatory
takings.
in
deciding
whether
there
is
a
regulatory
taking,
this
court
has
developed
tests
to
look
to
see
whether
the
nature
of
the
government's
restrictions
are
essentially
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain
or
appropriation.
and
that...
that
the
court
has
done
by
looking
principally
at
the
impact
on
the
property
owner,
not
the
rationality
of
what
the
legislature
has
done.
that
has
not
been
part
of
it.
for
example,
in
the
lucas
case,
the...
the
test
for
finding
a
taking
is
whether
all
economic
value
has
been
destroyed.
or
in
the
physical
appropriation
cases,
the
court
has
said
that's
such
a
fundamental
interference
burden
on
the
landowner
that
there
is
a
per
se
taking.
and
similarly
under
the
penn
central
test,
the
central
inquiry
is
on
the
economic
impact
and
the
interference
with
investment-backed
expectations,
things
that
look
to
the
impact
on
the...
on
the
landowner.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's...
that's
correct,
although
i...
although
i
should
say--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
no.
that...
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that's...
that's
the
difference.
if
something
doesn't...
if
the
legislature
couldn't
rationally
conclude
that...
that
the
measure
will...
will
serve
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose,
it's
invalid
and...
and
therefore
not
a
taking.
it's
improper
governmental
action.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in...
in
fact,
the
point
you
made
that
it
has
not
actually
affected
the
outcome
i
think
is
an
important
consideration
for
this
court.
and...
and
now
that
the
court
is
focusing
on
the
question
of
whether
this
really
does
logically
fit
into
the
just
compensation
clause
jurisprudence,
i...
i
think
it...
i
think
it's
important
to
consider
that
the
court
has
not
actually
ever
struck
down
a
measure
under
the
just
compensation
clause
outside
the
exactions
situation
which
present
the
different
consequence
of...
of
a
physical
appropriation.
the
court
has
not
ever
actually
struck
down
a
statute
on...
on
that
basis.
but
with
respect
to
that
language,
it...
it
arose
in
agins.
there
was
a
little
bit
of
discussion
along
those
lines
in
penn
central,
but
in
agins,
which
most
people
see
as...
as
the
origin
of
it,
the
court,
as
was
pointed
out,
relied
upon
village
of
euclid
and
upon
nectow,
both
of
which
were
due
process
cases
and
both
of
which
applied
a
rational
basis
test.
and
in
fact,
on
pages
24
and
25
of
our
brief,
we
set
out
the
quotations
from
nectow
and
euclid
which
show
that
the
court...
the
court
there
was
using
the
notion
of
whether
the
measure
will...
will
further
a
substantial
or
has
a
substantial
relation
to
the
public
health,
really
in
contradistinction
to
something
that
is
irrational.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
excuse
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
moore?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
well,
cases...
cases
involving
the...
the
family
unit
i
think...
i
mean,
those
are...
those
go
beyond
simply
the
question
of
the...
of
regulating
property.
those...
those
get
into...
those
get
into
questions
of...
of
who's
occupying...
who's
occupying
the
house.
but...
but
in
village
of
belle
terre,
the...
the
court
applied
a
rational
basis
test
to
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
not
the
number...
not
the
number
of
people.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
case
concerned--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--a
family,
the...
the
question
of
interfering...
possible
interference
with
a
family
unit.
but
in
village
of
belle
terre,
the
court
applied
a...
a
rational
basis
test
to
a
zoning
ordinance
that
regulated
unrelated
people
living
in...
living
in
the
same
house.
so
the
phrase,
substantially
advance,
while
it
may
have
that
ring
to
it,
in
fact
its
origins,
when
you
look
at
page
25
of
our
brief,
the...
the
court
in
nectow
explained
the
test
as
being
a...
a
court
may
not
set
aside
the
determination
of
public
officers
unless
it's
clear
that
it
has
no
foundation
in
reason
and
is
a
mere
arbitrary
or
irrational
exercise,
having
no
substantial
relation
to
the
public
health.
the
court
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood,
if
that
was
the
question.
we
think
it
definitely
should
be
eliminated,
and
the...
and
the
court
should
say
that
it
is
applying
the
rational
basis
test.
and
i
think
it's
instructive
in
the...
in
the
post-agins
era
to
look
at
the
keystone
decision,
both
the
dissent
and
the
majority
in
that
case.
it
was...
the
court
was
essentially
unanimous
that
the...
that
the
taking
provision
of
a
clause
does
not
authorize
an
inquiry
into
the
efficacy
of
legislation.
and
in
fact,
on
that
point,
the
dissent
quoted
this
court's
decision
in
midkiff.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
yes,
this...
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
court
applied
a
rational
basis
test
in
pennell
under
the
due
process
clause
and
it
would
be
odd
to
apply
a...
a
higher
test.
i
mean,
it
would
be
a
different
question
if
there
was
a
claim
of...
of
confiscation
of
the
property,
but
chevron
has
stipulated
that
it
could
not
make
out
a
taking
claim
on
the
basis
of...
of
its
economic
impact.
so
we're
talking
about
a
standalone
inquiry
into
the
efficacy
of
the
legislation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
now
i...
and
that
was
the
point--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
no.
i...
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that...
that
it
should--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--be
a
rational
basis
test
and
therefore
the
court
would
conclude
it
was
a
taking.
in...
in
the
regulatory
area,
if
the
court...
if
a
taking
is
not
made
out
on
the
basis
of
economic
impact
under...
under
penn
central
or
one
of
those
tests,
there's
no
taking.
you
don't
get
to
the
public
use
requirement
then
because
that
only
kicks
in
if
there
is
a
taking.
so
it's
the
due
process
rational
basis
test
that...
that
would
apply.
and...
and
as
i
said,
i
think
keystone,
with...
with
respect
to
applying
a
rational
basis
test
on
the
efficacy
question
is...
is
dispositive
on
that...
on
that
question.
now,
the...
the
court
did
say
you
can
look
at
the
character
of
the
governmental
action,
what...
what
the
government
is
doing
as
part
of
the
penn
central
test,
but
not
this
sort
of
means
and
efficacy
question.
and
we
do
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
jettison
that.
i
would
point
out
that
throughout
the
course
of
history,
the
court
has
sometimes
used
takings
and
due
process
kind
of
interchangeably.
and
we...
we
quote,
for
example,
the...
this
court's
rowan
decision
which
refers
to
the
plaintiff's
constitutional
claim
as
saying
that
the
regulatory
action
violates
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
constitutes
a
taking
without
due
process
of
law.
i
think
sometimes
the
court
has
used
or
parties
have
used
those
terms
interchangeably,
and
that
may
well
be
what
the
court
was
doing
in
agins.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
penn
central
where
that
phraseology
was...
was
used,
the
same
is
true
where
the
court
was...
was
relying
upon
the
due
process
part
of
goldblatt,
and
the
court
put
the
word
taking
in...
in
quotes,
i
think
perhaps
indicating
that
it
was
not
looking
at
a
literal
taking.
