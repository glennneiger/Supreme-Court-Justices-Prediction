justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we've
said
it
a
lot,
though,
haven't
we?
why
do
we
keep
on
saying
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
you
feel--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
would
you
feel
better
about
our
doing
that
in
order
to
determine
whether...
whether
there's
a
public
use
than
you
would
feel
about
our
doing
it
in
order
to
decide
whether
there's
been
a
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
wouldn't
all
of
your...
all
of
your
objections
apply
equally?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
you're
not
really
urging
us
to...
to
defer
the...
the
evil
day
and
simply
say,
well,
this
test,
which
is
more
than
rational
basis,
may
well
apply
to...
to
whether
there's
been
a...
a
public
use
or
not,
but
it
certainly
doesn't
apply
to
whether
there's
been
a
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
you
won't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
mr.
kneedler,
simply
giving...
giving
the
phrase,
substantially
advance,
the...
the
more
modest
meaning
that
you
argue
for
doesn't
solve
the
problem.
the...
the
statement
in
agins
would
still
be
incorrect.
agins
says
that
the
application
of
a
general
zoning
law
to
a
particular
property
effects
a
taking
if
the
ordinance
does
not
substantially
advance
legitimate
state
interests.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
so
we
have
to
eat
crow
no
matter
what
we
do.
right?
[laughter]
so
why...
why
go
through
all
the
trouble
of,
you
know,
redefining
substantially
affects?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
understand
you
as
saying
that
all
rent
control
constitutes
a
taking.
i
thought
it
is
only
unintelligent
rent
control
that
constitutes
a
taking.
[laughter]
or
do
you
not
think
that
any
rent
control
is
intelligent?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
i
agree
with
justice
souter.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
say...
you're
saying
it
doesn't
make
sense,
so
you
got
to
pay
for
it.
i
think
it...
it's
much
more
reasonable
to
say
it
doesn't
make
sense,
so
you
can't
do
it.
why
isn't
the
latter
the...
the
intelligent
reaction?
