suppose...
suppose
a
person
has
a
piece
of
property,
and
they
zone
it
suddenly,
no
building...
no
building...
which
destroys
the
value
of
the
property
pretty
much.
now,
should
we
just...
i
think
those
might
be
the
cases
where
this
language
began
to
appear,
something
like
that.
should
that
be
just
a
simple
rational
basis
review
too?
because
i'm
trying
to
put
the
case
where
it
might
be...
arguably
you
should
have
something
stronger
since
the
property
value
is...
is
seriously
hurt
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
they're
going
to
say,
well,
we
can
imagine
a
reason,
but
if
you
look
at
it
realistically,
you
know
there's
no
good
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
if
you
put
your
mind
to
it,
you
can
make
one
up,
which
is
sort
of
the
test
for
rational
basis
in
the
economic
context.
but
as
soon
as
we
become
more
realistic,
there
isn't
much
of
a
reason.
it
can't
satisfy
the
stronger
test,
though
it
could
satisfy
the
weaker.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
we
supposed
to
do,
to
return
to
justice
scalia's
question,
with
the
fact
that
this
appears...
i
counted
about
12
cases,
i
mean,
where
it
implicitly
or
explicitly
appears,
something
like
it.
are
we
supposed
to
just,
oh,
say
all
those
cases
were
wrong
and...
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
moore?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
moore?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
city
of
east
cleveland
where
they
had
the
grandmother
and
the...
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so...
so
we
might
still
keep
a...
a
stronger
test
where
a
zoning
ordinance
affects
the
number
of
people
that
could
live
in
a
house
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
who
could
live
in
the
house.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
grandparents--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
question,
of
course,
is
let's
imagine
you're
either
right
or
you're
wrong
as
to
its
being
a
regulatory
taking.
and
maybe
if
it's...
they
have
no
reason
for
it
at
all,
they
can't
do
it.
period.
and
if
they
have
some
reason
for
it,
even
a
sort
of
bad
one,
they
can
do
it.
but
if
that's
the
context...
we're
in
the
game
where
they
can
do
it...
why
should
it
matter,
in
respect
to
paying
compensation,
whether
their
reason
is
quite
a
good
one
or
just
barely
good
enough?
and
that's...
that's
the
puzzle,
i
think,
that
the
other
side
is
putting
to
you,
and
i
must
say
i'm
rather
moved
by
their
argument
because
it
seems
to
me
whether
it's
a
very
good
reason
or
just
a
barely
adequate
reason
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
they
should
pay
compensation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
burden
on--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--maybe
i'm
not...
i
thought...
are
we
in
the
world
in
which
you
agree
the
government
can
do
it
even
though
their
reason...
or
is
your
basic
argument,
no,
they
can't
do
this
at
all?
in
which
case
it's
not
a
compensation
question.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
forbids
them
from
doing
it.
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
compensation
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the...
let
me
go
back
to
my
question
because
i
haven't
heard
the
answer.
and
i'm
in
a
world,
imaginative
if
you
like,
where
hawaii
passes
this
statute,
and
what
we're
interested
in
is
not
whether
they
can
do
it,
but
whether
they
have
to
pay
compensation.
and
my
question
is,
what
in
heaven's
name
has
the
goodness
or
badness
of
their
reason
to
do
with
that
question?
after
all,
i
can
imagine
instances
in
which
their
reason
for
the
regulation
is
pretty
bad.
it
just
barely
survives,
and
they
shouldn't
have
to
pay.
and
i
can
imagine
cases
where
their
reason
is
wonderful
and
they
should
have
to
pay
or
maybe
they
shouldn't.
it's
neither
a
necessary
nor
a
sufficient
condition.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
you
should
have
to
pay.
now,
that's
their
argument
i
think,
or
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
want
you
to
explain
to
me
why
the
goodness
or
badness
of
the
reason,
once
it
has
passed
the
minimal
point,
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
you
should
have
to
pay
compensation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
holmes
said,
though
he
didn't
hold
that...
what
he
said
was
you
have
to
pay
when
the
regulation,
a
legitimate
regulation,
goes
too
far.
so
i
will
repeat.
why
does
the
goodness
or
badness
of
the
reason,
past
the
minimal
point,
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
a
regulation
goes
too
far?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he...
he
didn't
go
into
this
question.
let
me
give
you
an
example
that
will
make
it
clear.
let's
take
a
case
where
there's
the
best
reason
in
the
world,
fabulous
reason.
we're
taking
this
property
to
build
a
highway,
which
is
absolutely
necessary.
would
you
suggest
that
compensation
doesn't
have
to
be
paid?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
it
does.
now,
let
me
suggest
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
a
really
terrible
reason.
you
cannot
build
your
house
without
using
metal
pipes.
that's
our
building
reg
in
this
state.
now,
everybody
knows...
i'm
imagining
anyway...
plastic
pipes
are
just
as
good,
but
not
quite,
so
they
have
a
barely
adequate
reason.
do
you
think
that
they
have
to
pay
compensation
to
have
a
general
building
code
saying
you
can't
use
plastic
pipes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
is
an...
it
does
regulate
the
use
of
your
property
and
it
means
added
cost,
in
fact,
several
thousand
dollars
added
cost,
to
the
building
of
a
house,
and
come
up
here
and
argue
we
agree
there's
a
rational
reason,
but
it
isn't
so
you
can
do
it,
but
it
isn't
a
really
good
reason,
not
substantial.
now,
do
you
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
paying
compensation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
explain
it...
explain
your
theory
in
terms
of
the
example.
that
is,
imagine
that
the
benefits
of
the
network
of
dealers
of
gasoline
into
the
community
are
fabulous
and
obvious.
so
there's
a
great
reason
for
doing
this.
now,
why
is
it
that,
on
your
theory,
the
government
shouldn't
have
to
pay
compensation
then,
but
it
should
have
to
pay
compensation
just
because
the
benefits
are
not
obvious,
that
they're
bizarre,
that
they
don't...
may
not
really
exist?
that's...
you
see
why
i'm
having
a
problem?
