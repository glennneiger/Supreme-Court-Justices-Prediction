justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that...
that
means
if
it's
a
taking
at
all,
it's
got
to
be
a
regulatory
taking.
but
justice
kennedy's
question
is
what
is
the
test
for
determining
whether
it
is
a
taking.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
want
money?
you
want
a
money
judgment?
i
thought
you
wanted
them
to
stop
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
isn't...
i
thought
your
premise
was
that
because
the
statute
doesn't
authorize
any
payment,
that
is
a
way
of
stopping
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if...
if
hawaii
modifies
its
statute
and
says,
we
will
give
to
you
the
difference
between,
you
know,
whatever
the
rent
we...
if
we
can
figure
it
out...
whatever
the
rent
would
be
and...
and
what
our
statute
requires,
you'd
be
perfectly
happy.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
on
your
theory
it
would
easily
be
met
no
matter
how
severe
the
control.
i...
i
take
it
on
your
theory,
if...
if
the...
if
the
rent
control
ordinance
said,
$5
an
apartment,
that's
the
top
rent,
fine
with
you
because
it's
extraordinarily
efficient
in
relieving
poor
renters
from
the...
from
the
burden
of...
of
high
rents.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
can't
be
the
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
it
would...
in
any
case
it
would
pass
the
threshold
inquiry
on
your
test.
you
would
say,
boy,
it
doesn't
get
any
more
efficient
than
this
until
it
gets
to
zero.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
would
say
at
the
threshold
level,
there's
no
taking.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
would
you
then
do?
go
on
to
penn
central?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
if...
if
the
test
is
going
to
be
as
unhelpful
as
it
would
be
in
my
extreme
hypothetical,
why
have
the
test
at
all?
because
in
the
more
difficult
case
where
it's
not
$5
an
apartment,
but
a
case
like
this
in
which
the
justification
is
ultimately
a
justification
in
gasoline
prices
and
so
on,
the...
the
inquiry
is
going
to
be
much
more
complex.
penn
central
is
a
way
of
approaching
that
complexity.
why
do
we
bother
with
this
threshold
test
which
produces
a
bizarre
result
in
one
case
and
is
going
to
be
very
difficult
to
apply
in
another
case,
in
which
event
i
don't
see
the
reason
for
having
it
as
distinct
from
the
penn
central
difficulty
test.
what's...
what's
its
value?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
sensible
response
to
the
situation
you
posit
that
the
government
shouldn't
be
doing
it?
i
mean,
it's
a
little
crazy
to
say
the
government
is
acting
crazy.
therefore
it...
it
ought
to
contribute
money
so
the
net
economic
effect
is
somehow
zero.
there's
simply
a
transfer.
the
taxpayers
bear
a
burden
as...
as
opposed
to
somebody
else.
on
the...
on
the
justification
you're
giving
for
the
test,
you
would
say,
look,
if
it's
not
substantially
advancing
this
interest,
why
let
the
government
do
it
at
all?
i'm
not
saying
that
should
be
the
test
for
whether
the
government
should
do
it
at
all.
but
isn't
that
kind
of
the
sensible
tendency
of
the
test,
to
suggest
that
the
government
shouldn't
even
be
doing
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
the...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
the
whole
point
of
the
argument
you're
making
is
it
won't
hurt
me,
the
landowner,
quite
so
much,
but
if
it
doesn't
make
sense
at
all,
why
should
we
even
have
to
get
to
that
question?
why
isn't
the
more
sensible
thing
to
say
to
the
government,
stop
doing
it?
