we
will
hear
argument
next
in
lingle
v.
chevron
u.s.a.--
attorney
general
bennett.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
the
fact
that
discrete
or
individual
property
rights
are
being
affected
and,
indeed,
taken
justify
some
higher
level
of
scrutiny
than
we
would
apply
to
general
economic
regulation
by
the
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
speak
up
a
little?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
very
well,
general
bennett.
we'll
hear
next
from
mr.
kneedler.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
stewart.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
would
seem
that
you're
arguing
about
whether
this
amounts
to
a
taking--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--at
all.
and
you
have
to
look
at
how
severely
the
state
law
burdens
the
property
rights.
don't
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
attorney
general
bennett,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
25
years
ago,
in
a
case
called
agins
versus
the
city
of
tiburon,
this
court
declared
that
government
regulation
of
private
property
affects
a
taking
if
such
regulation
does
not
substantially
advance
legitimate
state
interest.
the
question
in
today's
case
is
does
agins
substantially
advance
as
language
state
a
valid
test
for
determining
whether
a
regulation
takes
private
property
without
just
compensation
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment?
this
case
involves
a
challenge
to
a
hawaii
statute
that
limits
the
rent
that
oil
companies
such
as
respondent,
chevron
u.s.a.
may
charge
to
dealers
who
lease
service
stations
owned
by
the
companies.
chevron
brought
suit
in
federal
district
court
claiming
that
the
rent
cap
affected
an
uncompensated
taking
of
its
property
in
violation
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
relying
on
the
agins
case,
the
district
court
held
that
the
rent
cap
took
chevron's
property
solely
because
the
cap
does
not
substantially
advance
hawaii's
interest
in
controlling
retail
gas
prices.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
hold
that
this
substantially
advances
formula
is
not
an
appropriate
test
for
determining
whether
a
regulation
affects
a
fifth
amendment
taking.
when
a
plaintiff
challenges
a
regulation
under
the
takings
clause,
the
basic
question
is,
is
the
regulation's
effect
on
private
property
equivalent
to
that
of
a
classic
taking
where
the
government
appropriates
or
physically
invades
the
property?
we
have
held
that
a
regulation
amounts
to
a
taking
if
it
requires
an
owner
to
suffer
a
permanent
physical
invasion
of
the
property
or
if
it
deprives
the
owner
of
all
beneficial
use
of
the
property.
under
our
penn
central
decision,
we
examine
a
regulation's
economic
impact,
the
degree
to
which
it
interferes
with
investment
backed
expectations
and
the
character
of
the
government
action
to
determine
whether
it
affects
a
taking.
in
stark
contrast
to
these
other
takings
tests,
the
so
called
substantially
advances
test
tells
us
nothing
about
the
magnitude
or
character
of
the
burden
the
regulation
imposes
on
private
property
rights,
nor
does
it
tell
us
anything
about
how
the
burden
is
distributed.
instead,
it
asks
whether
a
regulation
is
effective
in
achieving
its
intended
objectives.
a
regulation's
effectiveness
might
conceivably
be
relevant
to
a
due
process
challenge
but
it
has
no
bearing
at
all
on
whether
the
regulation
takes
private
property.
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
substantially
advances
formula
announced
in
agins
has
no
proper
place
in
our
takings
jurisprudence.
in
so
holding,
today's
decision
does
not
require
us
to
disturb
the
holding
of
any
of
our
prior
decisions
other
than
declaration
in
agins,
nor
does
it
prevent
future
plaintiffs
from
bringing
regulatory
takings
claims
under
any
of
the
other
theories
established
by
our
precedents.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurrence.
