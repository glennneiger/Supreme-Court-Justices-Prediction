mr.
craig
e.
stewart
justice
o'connor,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
content
of
this
court's
regulatory
takings
doctrine
and,
in
particular,
whether
that
doctrine
includes
the
inquiries
called
for
by
the
substantially
advances
test,
which
this
court
articulated
in
agins,
but
which
is
grounded
in
principles
the
court
has
long
recognized
both
before
and
after
agins.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
the--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--it's
a...
it's
a
regulatory
taking
because
the
government
has
not
physically
appropriated
the
property
or
condemned
it.
instead,
by
operation
of
its
regulation,
it
has
taken
the
property
interest
from
chevron.
it's
like--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--and
i
believe
that
question,
your
honor,
is
answered
by
pennsylvania
coal
where
the
court
found
that
the
fact
that
the
statute
at
issue
there
prevented
pennsylvania
coal
from
mining
a
certain
amount
of
the
coal
that
was
in
the
ground
that
it
was
otherwise
entitled...
be
entitled
to
mine...
took
that
property
just
as
assuredly
as
a
condemnation
of
it
would.
and
then
the
court
said,
but
the
seemingly
absolute
protection
of
the
just
compensation
clause
in
the
context
of
a...
of
a
regulation
that
affects
that
kind
of
appropriation,
as
opposed
to
an
outright
condemnation
of
it,
that
that
protection
is
subject
to
an
implied
limitation
that
is
exists
to
allow
the
government
to
serve
its
purposes,
as
pennsylvania
coal
described
it,
if
the
government
could
hardly
function
at
all,
if
it
were
required
to
pay
for
every
interference
with
property
rights
occasioned
by
its
regulation.
so
what
we
have
growing
out
of
pennsylvania
coal
is
a...
a
rationale
for
allowing
the
government
to
interfere
with
private
property
rights
that
would
otherwise
be
protected
and
otherwise
could
not
be
taken
without
compensation
in
order
that
the
government
may
serve
its
legitimate
purposes.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
i
think
it
goes
to
the
difference,
your
honor,
between
the
public
use
standard
and
the...
which
governs
in
a
situation
in
which
the
government
is
paying
compensation.
and
in
that
standard,
as
we've
been
discussing
to
day,
in
that
context,
the
court
has
applied
a
very
deferential
standard
because
the...
the
burden
on
property
rights
is
lesser
and
the...
the
impediment--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--to
governmental
action
is
greater.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
we...
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
is
a
compensation
issue.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
we
wanted
a
declaration
from
the
court
that
the...
that
they
cannot
proceed
with
a
statute
that
takes
our
rents
without
paying...
paying
for
us.
what's
happened
here
is
that
this
legislature
has
enacted--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--yes.
the
statute
does
not
authorize
payment.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
what
we
are
arguing
about
here
is
compensation,
and
the
standard
that
we--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--yes.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
your
honor,
the...
in
lucas,
this
court
found
that
a...
a
complete
deprivation
of
the
economic
value
of
property
constitutes
a
categorical
taking.
but
the
court
has
not
held...
it
did
not
hold
in
lucas
and
it
has
not
otherwise
held...
that
a
regulation
that
affects
less
than
a
complete
destruction
of
economic
value
is
categorically
not
a
taking.
the
point
of
the
court's
regulatory
takings
doctrine
and
the
inquiries
that
it
mandates
is
to
determine
those
circumstances
in
which
a
deprivation
that
is
less
than
a
complete
destruction
of
economic
value
require
compensation.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
and
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
it
goes...
it
stems
from
the
rationale
expressed
in
pennsylvania
coal
for
allowing
the
government
to
interfere
with
private
property--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--well,
part
of
the
question
whether
the
regulation
goes
too
far
is
whether
there
is
a
basis
for
imposing
the
burden
on
a
particular
property
right.
here
we
have--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the...
growing
out
of
pennsylvania
coal,
the
court
has
recognized
that
one
of
the
critical
factors,
if
not
the
most
critical
factor,
in
regulatory
takings
analysis
is
the
character
of
the
government's
action
and
the
nature
of
the
government's
interest.
it's
not
simply
a
matter
of
how
much
property
has
been
taken.
the
question
is
the
government's
basis
for
taking
that
property.
when
we...
what
we
have
here,
justice
breyer,
is
a...
is
a...
a
right
specifically
protected
by
the
constitution.
the
constitution
provides
that
private
property
shall
not
be
taken
for
public
use
without
just
compensation.
and
justice
holmes
in
pennsylvania
coal
was...
said
that
that
seemingly
absolute
protection
is
qualified,
and
the--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--compensation,
of
course,
has
to
be
paid
there.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
your
honor,
i...
to
me
there's
a
threshold
question
of
whether
a
general
building
regulation
of
that
type
really
would
be
a...
a
regulation
that
would
implicate
the
takings
clause
at
all.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
and
because
the...
the...
assuming...
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
really
a...
a
burden
on
property
rights
that
would
be
subject
to
the
takings
clause,
then
that
burden
requires
compensation
unless
there's
some
limitation
on
the
compensation
principle.
and
the
limitation
that
the
court
has
recognized,
growing
out
of
pennsylvania
coal,
is
the
need
for
the
government
to
function.
so
we
have
an
inquiry
into
whether
this
furthers
the
governmental
purposes.
now,
in
your
example,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
that
inquiry
would
be
satisfied.
our
point
is
simply
that
the
inquiry
must
be
made.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
yes,
and--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--the
compensation
would
be
measured
as
the
difference
between
the...
the
rent
that
was
allowed
under
the
regulation
or
the
statute
and
the
rent
that
the...
that
the
landlord,
the
lessor,
would
otherwise
be
entitled
to
collect
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
no,
that
is
not
our
position,
your
honor.
the...
the...
and
in
fact,
the...
the
state
has
specifically
disclaimed
any
contention
that...
that
this
is
like
the
typical
residential
rent
control.
so--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--and
our--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--your
honor,
our...
the
question
would
be,
under
our
analysis,
is
not
the
validity
of
the...
of
the
ends,
of
the
legislative
ends.
that
would
be
taken
care
of
in
the
inquiry
under
public
use.
so...
so
the...
so
the
question
of
the
legitimacy
of
the
government's
interest
in
controlling
rent
would
not
be
at
issue.
but
what
would
be
at
issue
under
our
test
is
the
connection
between
the...
the
rent
control,
the
burden
on
private...
private
property
rights
that's
imposed
and
the
nature
of
the
asserted
interests
and
the
degree
to
which
that
burden
furthers
that
interest.
now,
in
the
typical
residential
rent
control
circumstance,
where
the
purpose
of
the
statute...
where...
where
the...
where
the
legislature
is
concerned
about
the...
the
price,
the
rent...
the
rental
amount
that
residents
are
having
to
pay,
in
that
circumstance,
the
test
that
we're
proposing
would
be
easily
met
because
the
purpose
of
the
statute
would
be
to
grant
rent
relief
to
the...
to
the
tenants.
and
that
could
easily
be
accomplished--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--i
think
our--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--well,
i
think
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are...
this...
this
is
a
threshold
inquiry,
the...
the
hypothetical--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--i
think
that
it
would
pass
the
inquiry.
i
suppose
you
could...
you
could--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--yes.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
yes.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
you
would
have
an
inquiry
into
whether
there
is
a
categorical
taking
under
lucas
because
it
deprived
essentially
all
economic
value
of
the
property
and
you
would
inquire
under
penn
central
whether...
because
the
threshold
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
the
government's
interest
is
satisfied,
you
then
inquire
into
whether
the
burden
is
such
in
light
of
the
purposes
to
be
served
that
we
believe
it
goes
too
far--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--i
mean...
part
of
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
this
test,
in
our
view,
does
have
very
narrow
application,
which
is
the
reason
why
we
don't
believe
that
the
state
is
correct
in
suggesting
that
it
will
result
in
the
invalidation
of
all
kinds
of
economic
regulation.
having
said
that,
though,
i
do
believe
that
it
is
an
important
threshold
requirement
that
should
be
met,
and
if
the
government
has
not
identified
a
basis
for
singling
out
a
given
property
right
and
imposing
on
that
the
burden
of
a
regulation
and
if
it
has
not
demonstrated
that
the
burden
it
is
imposing
is
related
in
a...
in
a...
in
advancing
the
purpose
for
which
the
burden
is
being
imposed,
then
in
that
circumstance,
the...
the
rationale
for
imposing
that
burden
without
compensation,
in
contravention
of
the
compensation
requirement
in
the
fifth
amendment,
is
missing.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
and
i...
the
distinction
we're
relying
upon
there,
your
honor,
is...
is
the
question
whether
the
government
can
proceed
with
compensation
as
distinct
from
proceeding
without
compensation.
when
the
government
proceeds
with
compensation...
it's
going
to
pay
for
the
private
property
rights,
the
constitutionally
protected
private
property
rights,
with
which
it's
interfering...
then
we
demand
a
lesser
showing.
but
when
there
is
a
constitutional
right
at
stake,
the...
the
showing
should
be
higher.
we're
not
asking
whether
the
government
can
proceed
at
all.
we're
simply
asking
whether
the
government
can
proceed
without
compensation.
and
the
without
compensation
is
what
triggers
and
infringes
upon
the
very
rights
that
are
protected
by
the
just
compensation
clause.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
your
honor,
i...
the...
the
question
of
whether
it
makes
sense
turns
upon
the
standard
of
review
that
the
court
is
going
to
apply
to
answer
that
question.
and
when
we
are--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--because
of
the...
the...
the
difference
in
the
relative
interests
at
stake
when
we're
talking
about
proceeding
with
compensation
as
against
without
compensation.
in...
in
the...
it's
similar
to
the
other
protections
extended
under
the
bill
of
rights.
the
court
has
indicated
that
the
just
compensation
clause
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
bill
of
rights
as
any
of
the
other
protections
of
the
bill
of
rights.
and
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
government
may
proceed.
there
would
be
a
rational
basis
for
it
to
proceed
under
a
very
deferential
standard
that
would
be
applied
under
the
due
process
clause,
but
the
court,
nonetheless,
requires
a
higher
showing
because
of
the
intrusion
on
constitutionally
protected
rights.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
your
honor,
the
state's
position
in
this
case
is
that
by
preserving
a
network
of
lessee
dealers,
there
will
be
benefits
to
the
public
in
terms
of
lower
gasoline
prices.
and
i
think
their...
their
theory
is
that
those
benefits
would
far
outweigh
the...
the
modest
decrease
in
rent,
lost
rent
to
the
oil
companies.
and
so
that
it...
it
would
make
sense
if
the
government
wished
to
make
that
choice
and...
and
to
pay
compensation,
if
the
government's
theory
were
correct.
and
one
of
the
values
of
the
just
compensation
clause
and
the
constitutional
rights
that
it
protects
is
that
it
forces
that
choice
to
be
made.
it...
it
puts
the
decision
on
budget
as
opposed
to
off
budget.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
in
fact,
we
believe
that
is...
is,
in
essence,
what
is
occurring
here.
there...
there
is
no
claim
that
the
rents
that
chevron
or
the
other
oil
companies
were
charging
are
excessive
or
that
they
have
been
the
cause
of
any
problem
in
the
state
of
hawaii
that
hawaii
is
trying
to
address.
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
to
it
better,
your
honor.
one
reading
of
the
takings
clause,
the
just
compensation
clause,
would
be
that
the
government
should
pay
compensation
in
those
circumstances
where
it
is
depriving
property
owners
of
protected
property
rights.
but
in
pennsylvania
coal,
the
court
said
in
the
regulatory
takings
area,
because
of
the
need
for
the
government
to
function,
we
are
going
to
allow
the
government
in
certain
circumstances
to...
to
interfere
with
rights
without
paying
for
them.
and
the
inquiry
that
we're
saying
the
court
should
make
is
whether
that
need
exists
and
whether
the
burden
being
imposed
serves
that
need.
and...
and
again,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
this
should
not
be
considered
an
unfamiliar
concept
in
constitutional
law.
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
that
when
the
government
seeks
to
intrude
on
protected...
rights
protected
by
explicit
provisions
in
the
constitution,
on
the
basis
that
its
needs,
its
legitimate
interests
require
that
intrusion,
then
the
court's
role
to
enforce
the
constitutional
protections
is
to
make
that
inquiry
into
whether
the
need
is...
is
being
actually
served.
now,
i'd
like
to
at...
at
this
point
emphasize
that
our
position
is
not
that
no
deference
may
be
given
to
legislative
judgments
under
this
test.
our
position
is
simply
that
it
must
be
more
than
a
mere
rational
basis
test.
the
reason
why
the
court,
in
repudiating
the
lochner-era
cases,
has
held
that
mere
rationality
is
enough
to
satisfy
the
constitutional
standard
is
that
there
was
no
specific
constitutional
prohibition.
in
the...
and...
and
the
court
specifically
distinguished
those
circumstances
in
which
there
is
a
constitutional
right--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
most
courts
have
recognized,
although
i
don't
know
that
it's
settled,
that
a...
a
control
on
the
price
of
a
product
that...
that
a
business
has
produced
would
implicate
the
takings
clause.
and...
and
in
that
circumstance,
the
substantially
advances
test
almost
certainly
would
be
met,
and
our--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--yes.
the
florida
power
case
v.
the
fcc
where
there
was
a
regulation
on
the
prices
that
telecommunications
companies
could
charge
for
access
to
their
poles.
back
in
the
war
era,
there
was
cases
involving
rent
control
where
the
court
found
that
the
rent
control
was
justified
because
there
was
a
market
distortion
caused
by
the
extraordinary
imbalance
in--
mr.
craig
e.
stewart
--i
believe
they
were,
your
honor,
and
that
they
have
been...
that
this
court
has
discussed
them
in
those
terms.
but
i
would
like
to,
if
i
could,
address
the
broader
point
that
i
believe
your
honor
was...
was
making,
which
is
can
these
claims
just
simply
be
repackaged
and...
and
sweep
into
the
takings
analysis
all
of
the
regulation
and
apply
to
it
the
very
same
test
that
the
court
has
repudiated
in
lochner.
and
the
answer
to
that
i
believe
is
clearly
no.
the...
the
just
compensation
clause
is
limited
to
rights
of
private
property,
would
not
extend...
and
i
don't
believe
there's
anything
in
this
court's
precedents
that
would
require
it
that
it
extend
to
the
kinds
of
laws,
minimum
wage
laws,
wage
and
hour
provisions,
regulations
on
the
size
of
bread
loaves,
that
were
the
professional
licensing
requirements
that
were
the
subject
of
the
lochner-era
cases.
and
the
due
process
clause
extends
even
to
expectancy
interests
or...
or
reliance
interests
on
governmental
benefit
programs.
nothing
in
our
position
here
would...
would
apply
to
that
because
those,
we
don't
believe,
have
ever
been
held
and...
and
should
not
be
held
to
be
covered
within
the
specific
provision
of
the
just
compensation
clause.
your
honors,
in
nollan
and
dolan
and
first
english,
this
court
recognized
that
the
just
compensation
clause
is
not
a
poor
relation
among
the
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights.
in
first
english,
the
court
recognized
that
the
constitutional
provisions
by
their
very
nature
limit
the
freedom
and
flexibility
of
the
government
in
order
to
protect
constitutional
rights.
and
the
court
in
first
english
said
that
the
just
compensation
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
one
such
provision.
and
our
position
here
is
that
this
constitutional
right,
that
private
property
shall
not
be
taken
without
just
compensation,
should
be
entitled
to
the
same
protection
as
the
other
constitutional
protections
in
the
bill
of
rights,
and
that
just
as
with
respect
to
those
rights,
when
the
government
seeks
to
intrude
on
those
interests,
the
court
should
properly
inquire
into
the
nature
of
that
intrusion
and
the
justification
for
that
intrusion.
thank
you.
