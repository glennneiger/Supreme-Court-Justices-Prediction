mr.
mark
j.
bennett
justice
o'connor,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
70
years
the
federal
courts
have
deferentially
reviewed
both
the
efficacy
and
the
wisdom
of
legislation,
even
when
it
affects
property
interests.
this
case
squarely
presents
the
question,
should
we
now
turn
back
the
clock?
we
make
two
main
arguments:
first,
that
the
substantially
advance
test
should
not
be
a
standalone
test
for
determining
whether
regulation
affects
a
taking
because
such
a
test
is
fundamentally
divorced
from
a
major
principle
of
the
regulatory
takings
doctrine
itself,
economic
injury;
and
second,
if
there
is
such
a
standalone
test,
it
ought
to
be
no
more
searching
than
the
rational
basis
test
of
due
process.
as
this
court
has
stated
in
first
english,
the
just
compensation
clause
is
not
designed
to
interfere
with
the
ability
of
government
to
affect
property
interests,
but
rather
to
require
just
compensation
in
the
event
of
an
otherwise
valid
taking.
in
this
particular
case,
we
had
a
circumstance
where
one
single
federal
judge
conducted
a
fact
trial
where
she
evaluated
the
demeanor
and
credibility
of
one
expert
from
chevron
and
one
expert
from
the
state
of
hawaii
in
order
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
garden
variety
economic
regulation
was
constitutional
or
unconstitutional.
there
was
no...
the
test
applied
would
have
been
no
different
if
this
had
been
an
act
of
congress
instead
of
an
act
of
the
hawaii
state
legislature.
in
this
case,
what
the
district
court
did
was
wholly
inconsistent,
we
submit,
with
any
reasonable
concepts
of
federalism,
and
if
it
had
been
an
act
of
congress
that
this
district
court
judge
was
sitting
in
judgment
of,
it
would
have
been
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
respect
that
this
court
has
consistently
said
is
due
to
a
co-equal
branch
of
government.
a
particular
irony
of
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
applied
what
it
believed
to
be
the
agins
test,
which
it
indicated
the
standard
of
review
fell
somewhere
between
rational
basis
and
rough
proportionality,
but
the...
the
supreme
irony
of
that,
we
suggest,
is
that
if
that
test
were
applied,
it
would
have
the
effect
of
overruling
the
very
cases
that
agins
cited
in
supporting
the
language
it...
it
used,
that
if
indeed
you
have
this
type
of
intermediate
scrutiny,
cases
like
nectow
and
euclid
v.
village
of
ambler
could
not
stand
because,
as
this
court
has
said,
those
cases
set
out
a
rational
basis
test,
whether
the
object
was
in
the
power
of
the
legislature
or...
or
the
municipal
authority
and
whether
the
means
used
to
achieve
it
were
rational.
and
the
test
the
ninth
circuit
set
up
in
this
case
and,
as
applied
by
the
district
court,
would
have
overruled
those
very
cases
because
there
would
have
been
a
fact
trial
necessary
to
determine
whether
or
not
the...
the
zoning
ordinances
at
issue
in
that...
in
those
cases
were
efficacious
or
inefficacious.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
no,
your
honor.
we...
we
would
think,
first
of
all,
this...
this
court
has
established
that
it
doesn't
look
at
whether
some
stick
in
the
bundle
of
rights
is
affected
by
the
regulation.
it
looks
at
the
parcel
as
a
whole.
and
second,
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
shying
away
from
per
se
tests,
and
indeed,
it...
it
looks
at
these
types
of
cases
under
the
rubric
of
penn
central
where
the
primary
factor
that
the
court
looks
at
is
the
extent
of
the
economic
injury
and
also
the
extent
to
which
it
interferes
with
reasonable
investment-backed
expectations.
a
particular
irony
of
this
case
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
this
particular
statute
of
the
hawaii
legislature
affects
a
taking
without
any
regard
to
whether
or
not
it
caused
any
economic
injury
to
chevron
at
all.
this
court
has
found
that
when
the
major
flaw
in
legislation
or
the...
the
major
argument
as
to
why
legislation
should
be
deemed
to
be
unconstitutional
turns
on
the
legitimacy
of
the
legislation,
that
finds
a
natural
home
in
the
due
process
analysis,
rather
than
in
an
analysis
that
looks
at
whether
or
not
the
legislation
actually
effects
a
taking
or
not.
indeed,
this
court,
your
honor,
despite
what
it
said
in
agins
in
relying
on
the
due
process
analysis,
has
never
found
a
taking
based
upon
doubt
as
to
the
likely
efficacy
of
economic
legislation.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
in...
in
del
monte
dunes,
every
opinion
in
the
case
discussed
this
language
and...
and
said
that
the
court
has
never
indicated
that
this
sets
out
a
more
exacting
test
than
rational
basis
other
than
in
the
rough
proportionality
context
of
nollan
and
dolan.
and
i
think
the
language
used
in
agins,
which
came
from
due
process
cases,
has
somewhat
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own,
and
the
lower
courts
and
the...
the
supreme
courts
of
the
several
states
have
had
quite...
have
had
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in...
in
dealing
with
what
exactly
the
language
means.
we
believe,
as
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief,
that
to
the
extent
it
establishes
this
intermediate
scrutiny,
as
the
ninth
circuit
felt
it
did,
that
it
would
be
dicta
in
agins,
but
if
the
court
viewed
it
as
not
dicta,
we
think
that
the
court
ought
to
reconsider
the
constitutional
rule
under
the
standards
for
such
reconsideration
that
the
court
has
identified
in
cases
like
payne
v.
tennessee.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
your
honor,
if...
if
the
claim
was
that
the
legislation
was
irrational,
that
it--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--no--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--no,
your
honor.
we
would
suggest
that
this
court's
jurisprudence
indicates
that
that
type
of
a
claim
of
a
taking
ought
to
be
analyzed
under
the
penn
central
test
where
you
first
do
look
at
the
extent
of
the
economic
devaluation,
if
you
will,
of
the
property
and
you
look
at
whether
there
is
an
interference
with
reasonable
investment-backed
expectations--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--well,
we
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
what
the
court
does
is
say
that...
that
in
agins,
what
the
court
was
essentially
doing
was
restating
a
due
process
test,
and
either
say--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
we
would...
we
would
say
that
the
court
ought
to
say
that
in
agins
the
court
was
restating
a
due
process
test,
and
if
this
is
to
be
a
standalone
test,
it
ought
to
be
part
of
due
process.
but
if
it
finds
a
home
in
the
just
compensation
clause,
it
ought
to
find
a
home
in
the...
in
the
public
use
portion
of
the
just
compensation
clause
where
if,
indeed,
the
economic
impact
in
a
regulatory
takings
context
is
so
severe
that
it
constitutes
a
taking,
then
whether
it
rationally
advances
a
state
goal
ought
to
be...
ought
to
inform
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
a
public
use,
but
that
it
shouldn't
be
a
standalone
test
for
really
sitting
as
a
super-legislature
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
really
advances
the
government's
goals
as
opposed
to
whether
it
could
rationally
have
advanced
the--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--well--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--certainly
if
it
were
more
than
rational
basis.
so
we're...
we're
suggesting
that
it
oughtn't,
wherever
it's
put,
be
more
than
a
rational
basis
test.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
no,
absolutely
not.
it
shouldn't...
it
shouldn't--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--it
shouldn't
apply
to...
to
either
one,
and
wherever
this...
if
the
court
wants
to
say
that
this
language
needs
to
find
a
home
somewhere
and
it
isn't
in
due
process,
then
it
shouldn't
be
more
than
a
rational
basis
test
wherever
it's
put.
in
many
ways,
your
honor,
this
statute,
act
257
of
the
hawaii
legislature,
is...
is
almost
identical,
although
less
intrusive,
than
the
statute
that
this
court
upheld
in
exxon
v.
maryland.
the
goal
of
the
statute
in
both
cases
was
the
same.
it
was
to
preserve
competition
in
the
retail
market,
and
in
hawaii,
where
we
have
at
the
refinery
level
a
duopoly
and
at
the
wholesale
level
an
oligopoly,
it
certainly
was
rational
for
the
legislature
to
believe
that
trying
to
prevent
the...
the
oligopolist
from
projecting
their
market
share
into
the
retail
level
would
have
the
effect
of
preserving
competition.
and
it
was
certainly
rational
for
the...
the
legislature
to
believe
that
limiting
the
rents
that
oil
companies
could
charge
their
independent
service
stations
so
that
they
couldn't
charge
excessive
or
predatory
rents
would
serve
the
goal
of
preserving
competition
in
the
retail
market
in
a
state
where
the
oil...
where
the
gasoline
prices
at
the
pump
are
the
highest
in
the
country
and
the...
the
market
at
the
two
levels
above
the
retail
level
is
extraordinarily
concentrated.
this
court,
indeed,
has
said--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--well,
your
honor,
what
we
would
say
is
that
this
court's
jurisprudence
is
that
in
applying
a
rational
basis
test,
one
doesn't
look
at
what
the
legislature
said
was
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
but
one
looks
at
what
could
be
advanced
as
a
purpose
for
the
statute
and--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--yes,
your
honor,
and
we
would...
we
would
be,
i
imagine,
positing
additional
reasons
why
the
statute
would
pass
a
rational
basis
test
than
those
actually
reflected
in
the
legislative
history
because
i
think,
as
this
court
has
indicated
a
number
of
times,
that
requiring
the
legislature
to
state
reasons
or,
indeed,
looking
at
the
precise
reasons
stated
by
the
legislature
in
deciding
whether
the
statute
furthers
those
goals
as
opposed
to
other
goals
the
legislature
might
have
had,
simply
sets
this
court
up
as
a...
as
i
said,
a
super-legislature,
and...
and
really
opens
the
door
to
the
type
of
intrusive
review
of
legislative
acts
that
this
court
has
not
engaged
in
for
more
than
70
years.
the
number
of
cases
that
the
court
has
looked
at
in
which
it
has
indicated
that
it
is
not
going
to
get
into
the
business
of
determining
efficacy
or
wisdom
is,
indeed,
legion,
and
really
since
the
new
state
ice
era,
the
lochner
era,
this
court
has
not
engaged
in
that
type
of
review.
and
in
fact,
in
lochner
itself,
the...
the
court
stated
that
we
do
not
believe
in
the
soundness
of
the
views
which
uphold
this
law,
and
one
can
take
that
and
look
at
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
this
case
in
which
the
ninth
circuit
does
essentially
the
same
thing.
your
honor,
in
our
representative
democracy,
decisions
as
to
the
wisdom
of
economic
legislation
are
for
the
political
branches,
not
the
courts.
the
voters
of
hawaii
have
a
remedy
if
their
elected
officials
fail
them.
it
is
in
that
forum
that
the
wisdom
of
act
257
should
be
debated.
justice
o'connor,
i'd
ask
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
your
honors,
this
case
is
not
about
compensation.
indeed,
chevron's
discussion
of
compensation...
the
first
time
that
that
occurred
in
the
entirety
of
this
case
was
in
its
brief
in
this
court,
as
we
point
out,
in
particular,
in
footnote
6
at
page
11
of
our
reply
brief.
this
case
is,
indeed,
about
whether
this
economic
regulation
is
legitimate.
the
ninth
circuit's
test
was
it
doesn't
work
well
enough,
so
it
is
illegitimate.
that
type
of
a
test
belongs
under
the
due
process
clause,
not
under
the
just
compensation
clause.
this
court
has
time
and
time
again
said
that
it
is
not
going
to
set
up
separate
per
se
tests
except
in
very
limited
circumstances
and,
indeed,
it's
not
going
to
divide
parcels
in
the
way
chevron
suggests
here
and
whether
it's
in
tahoe-sierra
or
penn
central
or
keystone,
the
court
has
said,
absent
taking
all
value
or
use
of
the
property
or
in
loretto,
in
the
case
of
a
physical
invasion,
it
is
going
to
allow
these
types
of
regulatory
takings
tests
to
be
judged
under
penn
central.
what
chevron
is
arguing
for
here
is
a
separate
test
outside
of
penn
central,
divorced
from
economic
impact,
that
concerns
solely
legitimacy
of
the
regulation.
we
suggest
that
that
belongs
in
due
process.
we
believe
that
what
the
court
should
do
is
say
that
what
was
stated
in
agins
does
not
state
a
standalone
test.
tests
for
judging
the
legitimacy
of
a
regulation
belong
in
due
process
based
upon
a
rational
basis
test
and
that
other
than
the
very
limited
per
se
categories
that
this
court
has
established,
regulatory
takings
claims
depend
on
economic
impact
and
belong
under
the
penn
central
analysis.
thank
you.
