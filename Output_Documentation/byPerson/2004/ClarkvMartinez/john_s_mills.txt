mr.
john
s.
mills
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
that
we
have
lost
sight
of
the
statutory
scheme
that
applies
here.
section
1182(d)(5)(a)
is
not
a
detention
statute.
it's
clearly
not
preserved
as
an
initial
matter.
it
was
not
in
the
answer
to
either
habeas
petition.
the
justification
given
in
the
district
court
in
both
cases
was
1231(a)(6).
but,
justice
breyer,
there
is
no
need
to
remand
this
case
because
a
clear,
simple
reading
of
the
immigration
statutes
demonstrates
that
1182
is
not
a
detention
statute.
you
have
to
go
through
the
process,
and
i
attempted
to
do
this
in
my
reply
brief,
but
i
think
i
can
do
it
a
little
bit
more
clearly
for
the
court
this
morning.
when
an
alien
first
arrives,
he's
an
applicant
for
admission.
section
1225(b)(2)(a)
of
title
8,
united
states
code
says
an
applicant
for
admission...
any
applicant
for
admission
shall
be
detained
until
the
removal
proceeding
unless
it
is
clear,
beyond
any
doubt,
that
they
are
entitled
to
come
in.
so
all
aliens,
when
they
apply...
that's
the
detention
statute
that
initially
applies,
1225(b)(2)(a).
they
are
to
be
detained
until
there
is
a
removal
proceeding.
the
removal
proceeding,
which
is
governed
by
1229(a)(1)...
i'm
sorry...
1226(a)...
it
is
1229(a)...
is
to
determine
whether
the
alien
is
admissible
or
not,
whether
they
should
come
in
or
whether
they
must
be
removed.
so
1225(b)(2)(a)
says
detain
until
that
point.
1182(d)(5)(a)
then
comes
in
to
authorize
the
government
to
stop
that
process
for
humanitarian
reasons
and
parole
an
alien
in.
we
won't
have
the
removal
process.
we're
going
to...
we...
we're
going
to
get
out
of
the
detention
in
1225(b)(2)(a),
and
we're
going
to
let
you
out
on
parole,
which
is
discretionary.
that's
1182(d)(5)(a).
if
at
any
time,
we
in
our
discretion
think
it
is
no
longer
appropriate
to
keep
you
on
parole,
we
can
revoke
that
parole,
and
the
statute
1182(d)(5)(a)
says
once
parole
is
revoked,
the
alien
is
treated
as,
quote,
any
other
applicant
for
admission.
so
you
go
back
to
1225(b)(2)(a),
which
says
detain
them
until
the
removal
proceeding.
mr.
john
s.
mills
that
custody
is
the
custody
under
1225(b)(2)(a).
that
is
the
statute
that
authorizes
the
custody.
that's
what
they're
being
returned
to.
1225(b)(2)(a)
is
detention
until
the
removal
proceedings.
and
in
the
demore
v.
kim
case,
this
case...
this
court
said
that
even
if
it's
a
long
time
and
there
aren't
other
procedures
in
place,
you
can
be
detained
until
your
removal
order
is
entered
because...
and...
and
the
emphasis
was
there's
an
end
date
to
that.
so
there's
an
end
date
to
detention
under
(b)(2)(a),
1225(b)(2)(a),
and
it's
the
removal
proceedings.
section
1231
is
the
statute
that
governs
removal
and
says,
okay,
now
what
happens?
it
says
you
have
to
remove
within
90
days,
but
for
certain
aliens
who've
committed
crimes
or
are
inadmissible
or
are
otherwise
determined
to
be
dangerous,
we
can
detain
them
beyond.
it
says
may
be
detained
beyond
the
period.
that
is
the
only
statute
that
authorizes
any
detention
of
an
alien
after
a
removal
order
other
than
the
specific
terrorist
statute,
1226(a),
which
was
enacted,
which
does
not
authorize
indefinite
detention.
it
says...
it
has
a
paragraph
labeled
indefinite
detention,
and
it
says
the
government
shall
not
indefinitely
detain
a
terrorist
alien
that
it
cannot
remove
except
that
if
the
government
determines...
and...
and
it
appears
to
put
the
burden
on
the
government...
that
the
person
is
a
danger
to
national
security
or
the
community,
it
can
detain
them
for
another
6
months.
and
then
you...
you
could
have
indefinite
detention,
but
each
time,
each
6
months,
the
statute
provides
for
review.
so
not
only
do
the
sneakers,
the
aliens
who
cross
across
the
border
in
the...
in
the
dark
of
night
from
mexico
or
wherever...
not
only
do
they
under
the
government's
own
admission
have
the
zadvydas
rights,
so
too
do
terrorist
aliens
by
statute.
and
to
suggest
that
by
some
implication
congress
has
intended
to
authorize
the
indefinite
detention
of
people
that
we
thought
we
should
welcome
into
our
country,
even
though
we
didn't
have
the
ability
under
our
quota
system
and
under
our
current
regulations
in
1980
to
let
them
in,
somehow
they
have
no
rights
against
indefinite
detention.
for
the
government
to--
mr.
john
s.
mills
--yes,
your
honor.
justice
ginsburg,
that's
their
sole
policy
argument,
and
frankly,
it
doesn't
hold
water.
just
yesterday
in
the
jama
case,
the
government
took
the
position
that
if
mexico
flooded...
flooded
our
borders
with
illegal
aliens
who
we
could
not
detain,
we
know
under
their
own
regulations,
if
they
snuck
in,
we
couldn't
detain
them,
but
if
a
new
mexican...
there
was
a
mexican
dictator
and
he
flooded
our
borders,
could
we
forcibly
repatriate
them?
and
the
government
said
absolutely
we
can.
we
can
go
down
and
put
them
back
in
mexico.
we
could
do
that
with
the
cubans.
we
could
let
them
out
the
gate
at
guantanamo
bay.
if
a...
a
rogue
nation
truly
invades
our
country
with
its
bad
aliens,
that
is
an
infringement
on
our
sovereignty,
and
i
think
that's
an
act
of
war.
and
i
think
the
president
has
all
kinds
of
options:
trade
sanctions,
go
to
the
united
nations,
diplomacy.
if
it's
really
something
bad
that's
going
to
be
a...
a
threat
to
our
national
security,
i
think--
mr.
john
s.
mills
--sure,
and
our
government
has
demonstrated
that
it
believes
in
preemptive...
preemptive
action
and
we
can
go
in
and
have
regime
change
in
cuba
if
it...
if
it
is
such
a
threat.
if
it's
a
political
decision,
the
purely
executive
decision,
that
our
national
security
is
so
threatened,
they
have
all
kinds
of
tools.
mr.
john
s.
mills
that
was
less
than
1
percent--
mr.
john
s.
mills
--that
was
less
than
1
percent
of
the
cubans
who
came
in
the
mariel
boatlift.
that
did
occur,
and
we
do
have
options
for
dealing
with
them.
we
can
return
them
forcibly.
if
they
don't
allow
us,
that's
like
them
sending
a
missile.
it's...
we...
we
can
destroy
the
missile.
we
can't
destroy
a
human
being.
by
punishing
a
human
being
that
castro
sends
over,
we're
not
sending
a
message
to
castro.
we're
not
saying,
ah,
you
sent
your
prisoners
over
here
and
were
going
to
indefinitely
detain
them.
mental
torture.
that
will
teach
you.
that's--
mr.
john
s.
mills
--that's
one
option.
if
there...
if
the
cuban
army
is
there
to
prevent
us,
you
know,
maybe
it
would
require
some
military
action
that
the
administration
might
decide
is
not
advisable.
but
those
are
the
options
depending
on
the
size
of
the
threat.
so
a
judicial
interpretation
that
the
statute
means
the
same
thing
in
all
contexts
does
not
deprive
the
government
of
anything.
and
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
that
if
i
could.
mr.
john
s.
mills
that...
that
is
my
point.
that's
the
point
that
i...
i
intend
to
make,
that
indefinitely
detaining
these
people...
that
does
nothing
to
a
dictator.
that
does
nothing
to
deter
a
dictator.
all
it
means
is
we're
going
to
be
incurring
the
huge
cost
of
incarcerating
a
large
number
of
people,
and
if
anything,
that
may
encourage
the
dictator
to
do
exactly
that,
or
it
may
encourage
the
dictator,
instead
of
sending
them
to
key
west
on
boats...
on
american
boats,
to
sneak
them
up
on
speed
boats
or
take
them
through
mexico
and
sneak
them
across
the
border
that's--
mr.
john
s.
mills
--exactly.
that...
that
is
exactly
correct,
justice
breyer.
and
if
they
think...
whether
a...
a
cuban,
a
mariel
cuban,
can
be
put
in
jail...
and
these
are
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
their
life...
is
a
huge
policy
decision.
and
this
court
should
abstain
from
putting
its
voice
as...
on
to
the
answer.
that
is
a
decision
for
congress
in
the
first
place.
in
zadvydas,
this
court
said
the
statute
doesn't
clearly
do
that,
so
we're
not
going
to...
we're
not
going
to
answer
that
question
as
to
whether
it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
john
s.
mills
that's
correct.
but
in...
in
this
case,
because
especially
the
zadvydas
aliens
had
clear
constitutional
rights,
we
avoid
the
question.
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
avoidance
says
the
court
doesn't
engage
in
that.
the
default
is
to
stay
away
from
it.
if
congress
wants
to
do
something
that
might
be
unconstitutional,
they
can
come
back
and
do
it
and
then
the
court
will
determine
whether
it's
unconstitutional.
back
to
the
point
of
whether
1231(a)(6)
can
mean
something
different
for
the
two
groups
of
aliens.
never
before
has
this
court
taken
a
statute
that--
mr.
john
s.
mills
--sure.
my
reading
of
that...
of
that
decision,
there
were
two
parts
of
the
decision.
there
was
part
one,
which
examined
whether
there
is
a...
or
it
determined
whether
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
and
part
two
is
whether
there's
a
constitutional
error.
it
was
only
in
the
part
of
the
decision
deciding
whether
there's
a
constitutional
problem
that
the
distinction
was
made.
the
distinction
makes
the
difference
in
whether
there's
a
problem
or
not.
and
maybe
there's
not
a
problem
for
inadmissible
aliens.
so,
the
court
then
concluded
in
zadvydas
that
because
there's
a
problem,
we
look
at
the
statute.
this
statute
could
be
interpreted
to
authorize
indefinite
detention
or
not.
it's
ambiguous.
because
we
have
a
problem,
at
least
with
one
category,
we're
going
to
choose
the...
a
safe
route.
mr.
john
s.
mills
i
think
that
that
is
absolutely
a...
a
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn
that
congress--
mr.
john
s.
mills
--that's
absolutely
correct.
and
they're
responding
right
now.
in
the
9/11
commission
bill,
there
is
a
section
that's
being
negotiated
as
to
whether
terrorist
aliens
who
can't
be
removed
because
they
would
be
tortured...
whether
they
can
be
indefinitely
detained.
and
they're
looking
at
the
same
limiting
language.
one
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
that
i
did
not
get
to
make
directly
in
the
brief,
but
it
was
raised.
justice
scalia,
you
had
a
question
yesterday
in
the
leocal
case,
and
it...
it
raised
an
issue
that
i
hadn't
looked
at
before
on
whether
a
statute
can
be
interpreted
differently
in
a
situation
where
the
reason
to
interpret
it
is
no
longer
there.
and
that's
the
rule
of
lenity
cases.
and
i
cited
as
a
supplemental
authority
the
united
states
v.
thompson/center
arms
company,
504
u.s.
505.
it's
a
1992
decision,
and
it
involved
a
tax
code
provision.
and
the
question
is,
do
we
apply
the
rule
of
lenity?
and
justice
stevens,
in
dissent
you
said
no,
because
this
is
a
civil
case.
the
rule
of
lenity
doesn't
apply.
but
a
three-judge
plurality,
an
opinion
by
justice
souter,
and
a
two-justice...
two-judge
concurrence
by
justice
scalia
both
agreed
that
the
rule
of
lenity
applied
because
the
statute
applies
both
in
criminal
and
civil
contexts.
and
you
can't
have
one
meaning
in
a
criminal
context
and
another
in
civil.
for
the
same
reason,
the
rule
of
constitutional
avoidance
should
not
result
in
a
statute
being
interpreted
one
way
when
there
would
be
a
doubt
and
another
way
when
there
would
not.
mr.
john
s.
mills
my
answer
to
that
is
that
that
might
be
a...
a
legislative
policy
decision
to
make
that
distinction.
but
in
1996,
iirira
abolished
the
distinction
between
inadmissible
and
deportable
aliens
after
they've
been
ordered
removed.
up
until
that
time,
it
makes
a
difference.
it
makes
a
difference
under
the
constitution.
but
once
they've
been
ordered
removed...
and
this
was
the
government's
argument
in
zadvydas.
once
they've
been
ordered
removed,
regardless
of
how
they
got
here
in
the
first
place,
they
no
longer
have
any
right
to
be
here
at
all
and--
mr.
john
s.
mills
--after
a
removal
proceeding,
there
is
only
one
class.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
mills
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
would
just
ask
that
the
court
reverse
in
this
case.
if
there
are
any
mootness
concerns
about
mr.
benitez,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
friends
of
the
environment
which
said
that
when
a
challenged
practice
has
stopped
voluntarily,
that
does
not
moot
a
case
out
in
the
supreme
court
unless
there's
some
reason
to
believe
they
won't
go
at
it
again.
and
the
government
has
asserted
that
it
can
revoke
his
release
at
any
time
for
any
reason
and
detain
him
indefinitely.
and
the
suggestion
that
the
fact
that
he's
been
released
under
the
cuban
review
panel
shows
that
his...
he's
been
protected
is...
is
not
well
taken.
he
was
determined,
when
he
first
was
detained
in...
in
2001,
that
he
was
eligible
under
the
cuban
review
panel
to
be
released.
it
took
3
years
and
the
week
before
this
case
was
argued
in
the
highest
court
of
the
land
before
the
immigration
service
did
what
its
own
regulations
told
it
it
had
to
do.
thank
you
very
much.
