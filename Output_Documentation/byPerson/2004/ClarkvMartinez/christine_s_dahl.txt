ms.
christine
s.
dahl
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
the
same
words
mean
the
same
thing
in
the
same
statute,
this
court
need
not
reach
the
constitutional
questions
presented
by
the
indefinite
detention
of
inadmissible
as
opposed
to
deportable
aliens.
without
going
to
questions
of
constitutional
doubt,
there
are
three
reasons
why
this
court
should
hold
that
section
1231(a)(6)
treats
inadmissible
aliens
the
same
as
it
treats
deportable
aliens.
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
justice
scalia,
i
don't
believe
it
provides
an
independent
basis
for
detention.
the
immigration
law
works
together
in
it's
various
elements,
and
section
1182,
when
parole
is
revoked,
treats
the
alien
then
as
an
applicant
for
admission,
and
section
1229
places
the
applicant
for
admission
into
removal
proceedings.
the
government
did
not
obtain
a
ruling
on
that
argument
from
the
ninth
circuit,
although
it
made
reference
to
1182
in
its
motions
to
stay
the
briefing
schedule.
it
ultimately
conceded
that
this
case
was
controlled
by
lin
guo
xi,
which
was
a
statutory
construction
of
1231(a)(6),
and
cert
was
granted
on
the
1231(a)(6)
issue
only.
the
reading
of
the
statute
that
we
proffer,
that
the
same
words
mean
the
same
meaning,
is
consistent
with
the
overall
changes
congress
made
in
1996
in
iirira
when
it
eliminated
the
category
of
excludable
aliens
and
replaced
it
with
a
single,
broader
category,
now
called
removable
aliens,
that
embraces
both
inadmissible
and
deportable
aliens.
third,
congress
knows
how
to
provide
for
indefinite
detention
when
it
wants
to.
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
i
believe
it
would
present
a
different
question,
but
the
constitutional
issues
presented
by
indefinite
detention
remain.
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
those--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
our...
our
point
precisely.
the
government
was
not
correct
when
it
said
that
it...
that
this
court
has
always
treated
excludable
aliens
the
same.
in
a
case
that
was
a
contemporary
of
the
mezei
decision,
kwong
hai
chew,
cited
at
page
45
of
our
brief,
the
court
found
that
an
excludable
entrant
on
ellis
island
was
entitled
to--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--we
disagree.
i
think
that
it
shows
that
the
court
will
consider
length
of
time
in
the
country
in
determining
what
amount
of
due
process
is
required.
now,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
of
1231(a)(6)
requires
the
same
treatment
between
inadmissible
and
deportable
aliens.
where
there's
no
difference
in
the
language
that
congress
has
used,
this
court
can
draw
no
distinctions.
there
is
a
presumption
that
congress
expects
its
statutes
to
be
read
in
the
same
manner
as
the
supreme
court's
interpretation,
and
because
of
the
interrelationship
between
the
parole
statute
and
the
revocation
proceedings
and
removability
proceedings,
there's
no
reason
for
this
court
to
resort
to
the
1182
statute
to
provide
the
authority
that
the
government
seeks.
the
relevant
authority
is
section
1231(a)(6).
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
well,
the
1182(d)(5)(a)
doesn't
provide
for
indefinite
detention.
what
it
provides
is
that
upon
revocation
of
parole,
the
alien
is
placed
into
removal
proceedings.
once
the
removal
proceedings
have
been
determined
and
a
final
order
of
removal
is
entered,
1231(a)
requires
removal
within
90
days,
and
failing
that,
the
appropriate...
the
relevant
statutory
provision
is
1231(a)(6).
that
says
that
the
alien
may
be
detained
beyond
the
removal
period
and
then,
if
released,
subjected
to
conditions
of
supervision.
1231
is
the
only
statutory
authority
for
post-removal
period
detention.
parole
deals
with
entry
and
1231(a)(6)--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--i
don't
think
that
the
court
could
carve
out
a
statute
and
use
it
in
a
way
contrary
to
the
way
it
functions
in
the
immigration
scheme
and
make
superfluous
or
irrelevant
a
more
express,
more
detailed
statutory
provision.
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
precisely,
your
honor.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
government
could
revoke
parole
and
then
suspend
proceedings
to
determine
the
admissibility
of
a
parolee
indefinitely.
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
i
don't
think
so
because
i
don't
think
that
1182
allows
the
interpretation
that
the
government--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--what
the
ninth
circuit
found,
though,
in
questions
of
an
inadmissible
alien,
that
this
court's
construction
of
1231(a)(6)
in
zadvydas
applied
and
there
would
be
no
need
for
resort
to
any
other
statute.
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
yes.
while
the
alien
is
awaiting
removal,
he
is
subject
to
supervision
conditions
that
will
safeguard
the
government's
interests,
and
for
as
long
as
he
is
waiting,
he
is
under
supervision.
it's
those
supervision
conditions
that
distinguish
this
case
from
the
situation
where
the
government
is
finding
national
security
risks.
that...
congress
has
expressly
provided
for
the
indefinite
detention
of
people
whom
the
attorney
general
certifies
as
presenting
risks
to
national
security.
it's
also
the
presence
of
a
national
security
risk
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
mezei
decision.
i
think
that
the
government
makes
more
of
that
decision
than
needs
to
be
made
in
order
to
find
that
mr.
benitez
and
mr.
martinez
are
in
different
situations.
they
were
allowed
into
this
country.
they
have
lived
here
for
24
years,
and--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--mr.
mezei
had
been
in
the
united
states
for
25
years
before
he
left,
and
he
was
gone
for
an
extended
period
of
time.
when
he
sought
to
return,
he
was
treated
as
if
he
were
an
initial
entrant,
and
the
government,
citing
national
security,
excluded
him
without
a
hearing
and
refused
to
disclose
the
evidence
that
was
the
basis
for
the
exclusion.
he
challenged
that
and
wanted
a
hearing
and
wanted
the
attorney
general
to
be
required
to
disclose
the
evidence.
the
court
found
that
his
release
into
the
community
itself
would
present
a
security
risk
and
therefore
sustained
the
denial
of
the
hearing
and
the
detention
of
mr.
mezei.
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
that's
correct.
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
i
don't
think
that
applying
the
statute,
as
it's
written,
leaves
the
government
defenseless.
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
congress
can
pass
another
statute,
if
it
needs
to,
and
the
government--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--i
disagree.
we
have--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--we
have
very
effective
means
of
interdicting--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--well,
after
the
mariel
boatlift,
the
government
changed
its
policy
and
now
intercepts
people
who
are
coming
from
cuba
by
boat
and
detains
them
at
guantanamo
bay,
does
a
screening,
and
has
a
more
effective
repatriation
process
for
people
that
they
do
not
want
to
come
in.
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
yes.
that's
exactly
what--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--i
think
that
would
present
a
different
question.
as
the
government
acknowledged,
people
who
come
into
the
country
without
inspection
are
entitled,
under
the
government
regulations,
to
the
protections
under
zadvydas.
and--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--well,
the
government
has--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--well,
congress
has...
has,
by
definition,
treated
those
people
as
inadmissible
aliens
who
are
subject
to
removal
proceedings.
and
the
interdiction
methods
are...
they're
purely
political
decisions
that
the
government
needs
to
make.
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
well,
if...
well,
first
of
all,
the
government
has
the
ability
to
detain,
pending
the
removal
proceedings,
of
people
who
are
trying
to
come
into
the
country.
the
question
becomes
if
they
can't
be
repatriated.
now,
the
patriot
act
in
1226(a)
does
allow,
in
instances
of
national
security,
for
the
attorney
general
to
indefinitely
detain.
now,
importantly,
that
statute
provides
for
procedural
protections
and
judicial
review,
that
is
absent
from--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--that's
correct.
the
government
has
not
made
any
allegation
that
there's--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--their
release
from
prison
presents
the
same
issues
that
the
release
of
any
person
who
has
served
the
sentences
that
were
imposed
after
the
commission
of
a
crime.
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
that's
correct.
and
the
conditions
of
supervision
that
the
government
can
impose
are
much
lengthier
and
could
be
even
more
onerous
than
the
kinds
of
supervision
conditions
after
prison
that
the
government
could
impose
on
its
citizens.
in
this
case,
mr.
martinez
and
mr.
zadvydas
both
received
permission
to
live
here.
both
committed
crimes.
both
served
their
sentences
and
both
were
ordered
removed.
nothing
in
section
1231(a)(6)
warrants
making
mr.
martinez
wait
for
removal
in
a
federal
prison
perhaps
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
while
mr.
zadvydas
awaits
removal
after
having
been
released--
ms.
christine
s.
dahl
--yes,
your
honor.
i
was
drawing
a
comparison
between
the
situation
with
mr.
zadvydas
and
mr.
martinez.
detention,
of
course,
needs
to
be
reasonably
related
to
its
purpose.
here
removal
cannot
be
achieved.
so
detention
for
that
purpose
becomes
arbitrary
and
punitive,
and
we'd
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
grant
of
habeas
corpus
and
mr.
martinez's
release
on
supervision
conditions.
