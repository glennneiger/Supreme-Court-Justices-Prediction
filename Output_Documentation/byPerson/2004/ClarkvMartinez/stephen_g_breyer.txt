justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
are
you...
are
you
arguing
now
that...
that
(5)(a)...
(d)(5)(a),
is
the
statute
under
which
you
are
detaining
him
and
that
1231(a)(6)
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
you're
arguing...
then
you
are.
you're
saying...
this
is
coming
to
me
a
little
bit
anew.
i
perhaps
didn't
read
it
carefully
enough.
but
i
thought...
let's
assume
you
lose
on
1231(a)(6),
that
i
can't
think
of
a
way.
let's
assume
that
i
can't
think
of
a
way
of
applying
the
same
words
to
your
alien
to
mean
something
different
than
were
applied
to
the
alien
who
was
in
zadvydas.
suppose
you
lose
on
that
point.
now
you're
saying,
well,
independently
of
that,
we
have
a
different
statute
under
which
we
can
detain
him,
namely
1182(d)(5)(a).
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now...
now
is
that
argument...
i
mean,
i'm
sorry
that
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that...
and
so
is
that
made
in
the
courts
below
and
everything
that
they're
doing
in
the
cases--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
does
it
say...
i
mean,
the
reason
i
guess
i
missed
it
is
because
when
i
looked
at
your
table
of
contents
and
elsewhere
in
the
brief,
it
seems
phrased
totally
in
terms
of
1231(a)(6).
that's
the
heading.
each
argument
seems
to
support
that.
and
then
on
page...
you
know,
when
you
refer
to
this,
i
guess
on
page
26,
you're
talking
in
a
section
about
what
1231
must
be
because
of
the
structure
of
it.
and
then
you
refer
to
other
provisions
such
as
the
one
you're
now
mentioning.
i
just
didn't
pick
up
that
it
was
a
totally
independent
basis.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
where
does
it
say
that?
i'd
like
to
just
glance
at
it
even
now.
where
does
it
say
that
in
your
brief,
that
it's
a
totally
independent
basis?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
read
and
it
was
in
a
structure
called
the
statutory
and...
text
and
structure
support
the
secretary's
detention
authority,
which
is
under
a
bigger
heading
saying
the
text,
structure,
and
history
of
section
1231(a)(6)
confirm
the
executive
branch's
authority.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
perhaps
i
could
be
forgiven
for
not
understanding--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
true.
that's
true.
absolutely
we
did.
and
also,
i'll
assume
for
argument's
sake
that
you're
completely
right
on
the
constitutional
point.
that's
just
for
argument's
sake.
but
assume
you
are.
so
there's
all
kinds
of
constitutional
difference.
still,
i
don't
see
how
to
read
the
statute
one
way
for
one
group
of
people
and
another
way
for
another.
the
statutory
words
in
zadvydas,
the
words
that
the
attorney
general
may
detain
this
individual
beyond
the
removal
period,
are
read
in
zadvydas
to
mean
beyond
the
removal
period...
may
detain
beyond
the
removal
period
means
for
a
reasonable
time,
presumably
6
months,
presumptively,
related...
reasonable
time
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute
which
is
to
find
a
country
willing
to
accept
them.
okay?
now,
i
haven't
found
a
single
case
of
this
court
where
you
interpret
these
complicated
words
one
way
for
one
and
another
way
for
another.
my
law
clerk
found
a
couple
of
cases,
communications
work
v.
bett
and
machinists
v.
street,
where
in
bett
particularly
the
court
strongly
implies
the
contrary.
it
says
you
can't
read
words
differently
just
because
we
interpreted
in
one...
you
know,
one
statute,
they
were
interpreted
in
light
of
constitutional
considerations,
and
now
we
have...
those
constitutional
considerations
aren't
here,
but
it's
the
same
words.
you
have
to
apply
it
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well...
well,
yes,
but
what...
what...
we
put
in
the
presumptively
6
months,
but
we
said
in
our
view
the
statute,
read
in
light
of
the
constitution's
demands,
limits
an
alien's
post-removal
period
detention
to
a
period
reasonably
necessary
to
bring
about
that
alien's
removal
from
the
united
states.
it
does
not
permit
indefinite
detention
interpreting
it
to
avoid
constitutional
threat.
we
include
that
once
removal
is
no
longer
reasonably
foreseeable,
continued
detention
is
no
longer
authorized
by
statute.
now,
i
don't
know
what
those
sentences
are
doing
unless
they're
interpreting
the
words
i
mentioned.
and
then
later
in
the
opinion,
we
say
it's
presumptively--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--not
always,
but
presumptively
6
months.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
interpreted
the
statute
as
doing
it.
now,
that
brings
me
back
to
the
original
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
person
who
runs
in
illegally,
a
person
who
crosses
the
border
illegally,
say,
from
mexico
is
entitled
to
these
rights
when
you
catch
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you...
you...
i
thought
there
was
a
reg
of
the
ins.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
tell
me
if
i'm
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
say
what
it
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
there
was
a
reg...
to
be
sure
we're
talking
about
the
same
thing...
where
the
ins
has
said
that
zadvydas
applies
to
individuals
who
run
into
the
united
states
illegally
from
mexico.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
still,
is
this
another...
could...
could
we
do
this?
i
noticed
that...
that
your...
the
petition
for
cert
in
benitez
has
two
questions,
both
of
which
are
about
interpreting
1231(a)(6).
the
government's
petition,
though
not
its
brief...
the
government's
petition
in
crawford
says
the
question
presented
is
whether
1231(a)(6)
in
zadvydas
compelled
a
release.
so
this
other...
this
other
matter
is
a
totally...
seen
as
a
totally
separate
ground.
perhaps
the
thing
to
do
is
we
send
it
back,
and
if
they
want
to
raise
it,
they
can
raise
it,
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
circuit
to
decide
whether
they
had
preserved
it
or
not
preserved
it.
is
that...
is
that
a
sensible
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
your
view
of...
of
what
1182
means,
and
they're
going
to
have
a
different
view.
if
they
want
to
argue
their
different
view,
they
could
do
it
in
the
ninth
circuit.
if
they've
waived
it,
they've
waived
it,
and
that's
up
to
them,
not
up
to
us.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
the...
congress
has
passed
a
special
statute
with
respect
to
terrorism,
hasn't
it,
where
it
does
authorize
detention
of
any
of
these
people
who
are
engaged
in
terrorism.
now,
i
don't
know
how
that's
defined.
is
that
defined
to
relieve
in
a
way
that's
broad
enough
to
relieve
some
of
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
anyway,
it's
a
little
drastic.
i...
i
guess
that
before
this
happens,
congress
might
enact
a
statute
like
the
terrorist
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it...
it's
interesting.
in...
in
just
my...
for
my...
my
own
information,
then
congress
did
respond.
and
there
were
two
areas
in
zadvydas
that,
you
know,
didn't
warn
congress
off.
one
is
the
one
we're
talking
about
now.
the
other
is
terrorism.
and
congress
responded
in
the
terrorism
matter.
is
that
right?
but
they
didn't
do
anything
on
the--
