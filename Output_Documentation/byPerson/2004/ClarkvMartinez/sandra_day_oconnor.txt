well,
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
mind
telling
us
whether
the
record
shows
where
martinez
and
benitez
are
now?
where
are
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
is
that
case
basically
moot?
benitez's?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where's
martinez?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
if
i
can
continue
for
just
a
moment
and
then
i'll
stop.
there
is
a
new
statute,
1226(a)
of
title
8,
part
of
the
patriot
act,
which
allows
detention
of
aliens
who
threaten
our
safety
or
security.
presumably
that
is
an
option
if
either
of
these
people
is
seen
to
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
available,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
you
haven't
answered,
i
think,
the
question
of
whether
the
government
is
entitled
in
this
case,
if
we
dispose
of
the
1231
question,
to
resort
to
the
other
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
other
person
was
named
benitez.
i
thought
we
had
zadvydas
in
the
other
case.
do
we
have
two,
a
martinez
and
a
benitez,
here?
