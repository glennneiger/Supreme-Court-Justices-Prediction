mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
cases
implicate
the
fundamental
power
of
the
united
states
to
protect
its
borders
by
excluding
aliens
who
arrive
at
its
borders,
but
are
found
under
the
law
not
to
qualify
for
admission.
this
court
held
more
than
100
years
ago
in
nishimura
ekiu
that
the
power
of
a
nation
to
forbid
the
entrance
of
foreigners
within
its
dominions
is
inherent
in
sovereignty
and
is
central
to
self-preservation.
if
it
were
otherwise,
the
integrity
of
the
nation's
borders
and
its
security
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
foreign
power
who
might
choose
to
foist
aliens
onto
our
country
or
to
the
self-help
efforts
of
aliens
who
might
leave
another
country
coming
to
our
shores.
the
migration
crises
involving
haitians
and
cubans
over
the
last
35
years
vividly
illustrate
the
adverse
consequences
of
such
a
regime,
and
events
of
recent
years
confirm
that
the
threats
to
the
nation's
borders
and
security
are
not
limited
to
nearby
nations.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the...
the
court
addressed
one
of
the
statutes
before
the
court
here.
it's...
it's
important
i...
i
think
to
recognize
another
statute
and...
that
is...
reflects
the
background
principle
of
this
court's
decision
in
mezei.
and
if
i
may
explain,
to
do
that.
this
court
made
clear
in
mezei
that
an
alien
has
no
substantive
due
process
right
to
enter
the
united
states
when
the
executive
branch
has
determined,
under
the
law,
that
he
has
no
right
to
enter
the
united
states.
the
relevant--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
i
believe
it
is,
but
it...
but...
but
first
of
all,
there
is
another
statute
which
is
highly
relevant
to
this,
and
that
is
1182(d)(5)(a),
the
parole
statute.
it
is
the
parole
statute
that...
that
has
long
governed
whether
an
alien
who
arrives
at
our
shores
and
has
not
been
shown
to
be
admissible
may
enter
the
united...
may
enter
the
united
states.
the
parole
statute
is
set
forth
at
petition
appendix
3a...
excuse
me...
page
3a
of
our
brief.
that
is
the
only
statute
that
affirmatively
authorizes
aliens
to
enter
the
united
states.
that
statute
is...
obviously
confers
no
rights.
it
is
written
entirely
in
terms
of
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
now
the
secretary
of
homeland
security.
it
says
the
attorney...
the
secretary
may,
in
his
discretion,
temporarily
under
conditions
that
he
prescribes
and
for
urgent
and
humanitarian
reasons,
parole
an
alien
into
the
united
states.
but
it
says
that
parole
does
not
constitute
an
admission,
and
it
may
be
revoked
at
any
time
when
the
secretary
in
his
opinion
concludes
that
the
purposes
of
the
parole
have
been
satisfied.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
they...
they
are
independent
authorities
for
the
detention--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
absolutely,
and
the...
and
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
and
we...
we
make...
we
do
make
that
argument
in
our
brief.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
we
made
it
at...
we
made
it
in
both
courts
below,
and
we...
and
we
think
it's
clear
from
the
background
of...
of
this
statute
that
it
does...
that
it
does
confer
independent
authority.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
with
respect,
it
doesn't.
1231(a)(6)
is
an
additional...
on
its
face
is
an
additional
grant
of
detention
authority.
it
is
not...
but
whereas,
the...
the
parole
authority
which...
which
for
years
until--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
an--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--an
applicant
for
admission
includes
anyone
who
has
been
found
not
to
be
admissible
to
the
united
states.
8
u.s.c.
1225(a)(1)
provides
that
any...
any
alien
in
the
united
states
who
has
not
affirmatively
been
found
to
be
admissible
is
an
applicant
for
admission.
and
the...
the
statutes
dealing
with
applicants
for
admission
or
aliens
who
arrive
at
our
shore
establish
that
detention,
even
indefinite
detention,
is...
is
not
only
permitted,
but
required
unless
the
secretary
releases
someone.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
well,
the...
the
parole
statute...
if
someone
was
taken
into
custody,
the
parole...
who
had
sneaked
across
the
border,
that
person,
under
the
1996
revisions,
is
an
applicant
for...
for
admission,
and
the
parole
statute
would
govern
that.
as
a
constitutional
matter,
and
particularly
with
respect
to
procedural
due
process,
the
court
has
suggested
in
a
number
of
its
cases
that
there
may
be
a
difference
between
somebody
who
arrives
at
our
borders
and...
and
is
stopped
and
somebody
who...
who
sneaks
through.
at
least
as
a
procedural
matter,
the
government
would
have
to
establish
that
he
has
no
right
to
be
here.
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
we
believe
the
parole
statute
furnishes
independent
authority--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
and...
and
if
i
may,
the...
the
special
statutes
that
govern
the
parole
of
mariel
cubans
that
we
reproduce
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
at
212.12
were
promulgated
in
1987
before
1231(a)(6)
was
enacted
in
1996.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
on
page
12...
26
to
27.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
should...
i
should
also--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and...
and
i
should
also
point
out
that...
that
in...
in
our
response
to
the
petition
in
the
benitez
petition,
we
expressly...
we
expressly
argued
that
1182(d)(5)(a)
is
an
independent
source
of
authority.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
my...
my
point
is
that's
not
the
exclusive
basis.
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
inapplicable
to
this
category.
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--or...
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
or...
or...
but...
but
what
congress...
if
i
may
go
back
to
the
parole
statute,
before
1231(a)(6)
was
enacted,
the
only
statute
that
governed
the
detention
and
the
release
of
aliens
arriving
at
our
shores,
what
used
to
be
called
excludable
aliens,
was
the
parole
statute.
that
provision...
until
the
aliens
before
this
court
were
ordered--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--1182(d)(5)(a).
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
until
there
is
an
order
of
exclusion,
even
now
the
parole
statute
is
the
only
statute
that
governs
the
detention
and
release
of
the
alien.
and
i
think
it
would
be
impossible
to
read
into
1182(d)(5)(a)
any
6-month
limitation
or
any
limitation
at
all
on
how
long
someone
can
be
detained
because
that
statute
sets
up
a
presumption
of
custody
with
release
only
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
or
now
the
secretary
of...
of
homeland
security.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
are
a
number
of
responses
to
that.
first,
as
a
factual
matter,
with
respect
to
welcoming
into
the
united
states,
what
gets
cited
for
that
proposition
is
a
statement
by
president
carter
in
may
5
of
1980.
10
days
later,
before
the
aliens
in
this
case
came
to
this
country,
he
made
clear
that
people
should
not
do
this.
he
encouraged
people
not
to
go
to
cuba.
the
ins
brought
enforcement
actions
against
people
who
went
there.
there
were
criminal
prosecutions
that
were
brought.
so
people
were
not
encouraged
to
come
to
the
united
states
in
this
way.
with
respect
to
the
regime
that
you
say...
i
believe
you
said
they're...
they're
admitted
just
like
under
any
other
regime.
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
were
allowed
into
the
country
under
the
parole
statute
that
i
just
read,
which
makes...
which
makes
it
clear
that
they
are
admitted
not...
not
in
a
way
that
confers
any
rights
on
them,
but
they
are
admitted
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
for
public
benefits
under
circumstances
which
make
clear
that
it
is
not
an
admission
and
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no...
no
vested
right
to
come
into
the
united
states.
it
is,
in
effect,
a
revocable--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--at
the
sufferance
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and...
and
the
question
we
have
here
is
when
the...
when
and
if
the
united
states,
pursuant
to
this
statute,
decides
no
longer
to
suffer
the
aliens
being
at
large,
but
instead
return
them
to
the
border,
in
effect,
or
return
them
to
detention,
this
statute
makes
clear
that
that...
that
whatever
practical
experience
they
have
had
at
large
in
the
country
is
always
subject
to
revocation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
court
has
always
treated
as
the
same
the
custody
of
an
alien
who
arrives
at
the
border
and
has
not
been
admitted,
whether
that
person
stays
on
the
boat,
goes
to
ellis
island,
which
the
court
said
was
not
an
entry
that
gave
somebody
constitutional
rights
to
come
here.
in
the
kaplan
v.
tod
case,
you
had
the
example
of
a
person
who
was
paroled
for
9
years
and
regarded
as
not
being
in
the
united
states.
and
what
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--with
respect,
i
think
it
is
not...
it
is
not
a
fiction
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
issue
because
there's
a
critical
difference
between,
for
example,
a
lawful
permanent
resident...
a
person
does
not
acquire
lawful
permanent
resident
status
by
something
like
adverse
possession,
by
living
in
the
united
states
for
a
long
period
of
time.
it
is
an
affirmative
grant
of
status
for
permission
to
reside
permanently
in
the
united
states.
it
is
a
grant
of
a
status--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
court...
this
court
thought
otherwise
in...
in
zadvydas
3
years
ago
where
it
drew
a
distinction.
it
said
the
distinction
between
someone
who
has
never
entered
the
country
and
someone
who
has
effected
an
entry--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but...
but,
with
respect,
the
court
did
not
construe
any
word
in
this
statute
to
impose
the
limitation
that
you're
describing.
the...
the
way
the
court
posed
the
question
was
does
it...
does
it
affirmatively
grant
a
power
for
detention
of
these
aliens
in
these
circumstances.
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
court's
opinion,
the
court
put
to
one
side--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but...
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but...
but
the...
the
mode
of
analysis
of
the
court...
it
starts
with
the
introduction
to
the
court's
opinion,
and
this
is
at
page
682.
it
says...
of...
of
zadvydas.
we
deal
here
with
aliens
who
are
admitted,
aliens
who
have
not
yet--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
but...
but
that...
that's
setting
the
court...
the
case
up.
but
then
what
the
court
says,
in
terms
of
how
it
interprets
the
statute,
we
construe
the
statute
to
contain
an
implicit
reasonable
time
limitation,
the
application
of
which
is
subject
to
federal
court
review.
well,
what
is
a
reasonable
time
depends
upon
the
circumstances.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
what...
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--what...
what
the...
what
the
court
was
doing
was...
the...
the
standard
that
the
court
announced
at
the
beginning
of
its
opinion
was
a
reasonable...
a
reasonable
time
limitation,
the
application
of
which
is
subject
to
court
review.
as
applied
to
permanent
resident
aliens,
the
court
saw
a...
a
constitutional
problem
and,
in
that
situation,
came
up
with
a
presumptive
6-month
rule.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
no,
i
don't
believe...
with...
with
respect,
what...
what
i
believe
the
court
said
was
that
there
is
a
reasonable
time
limitation.
and
given
the...
given
the
distinction
that
runs
throughout
immigration
laws,
this
court
said
at
page
2,500
of
the
supreme
court
reports
in
this
decision,
the
distinction
between
aliens
who
arrive
at
our
borders
and
are
governed
by
mezei,
as
opposed
to
people
who
enter,
runs
throughout
our
immigration
law,
i
would
think
that
it
would
run
throughout
1231(a)(6).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and...
first
of
all,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case
because
we
have
a
regime
where
each
of
the
aliens
before
this
court,
came
here,
was
paroled--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
if...
if
i
may
go
to
the
mezei
case,
what
the
court
said
there
is
that
the
detention
of
the
alien
on
ellis
island
was
effectuating
his
exclusion.
the
two
cannot
be
distinguished
from
one
another.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
benitez
has
been
released
to
a
half-way
house.
we
sent
the
court
a
letter--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--last
week
showing
that
the
review
process
under
these
regulations
actually
works.
it's
been
working
for
15
years.
and
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
more
than
9,000
people
have
been
granted
parole
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
hasn't
been...
he
hasn't
been...
i
think
he's
still
in...
in
custody.
whether...
if...
if
he...
if
he
completes
that
and
is
released,
a
question
of
mootness
may
arise
at
that
point.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
martinez
was
released
pursuant
to
the
court...
district
court
order
almost
2
years
ago,
and
he's...
he's
now
at
large
under
an
order
of
supervision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if...
if
there's
an...
if
there
is
an
individualized
reason
to
believe
that
an
alien
would
be
a
terrorist
or...
or
a
threat
to
the
security
in
that
respect,
but
the
threat
to
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that...
that's
available,
but
the
threat
to
the
national
security
here
is
much
larger
than
that.
if...
again,
if
we
go
back
to
the
immigration
crises
involving
haiti
and
cuba,
there...
there
is
a
threat
to
the
national
security
when
another
nation
can
foist
aliens
onto
our
shores,
and...
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
the
united
states
had
no
ability
to...
to
deflect--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
no,
surely.
what...
the...
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--whatever
right...
in...
in
a
criminal
prosecution
the
bill
of
rights
would
apply
to
that
person.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
we...
our
position
is
not
that
he's...
not
that
he's
not
a
person.
the
question
is
what...
is
what
process
is
due.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it...
depending
upon
the
context.
the
one
protection
for
liberty
he
does--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he
has
no
substantive
due
process
right
to
be
released
into
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
absolutely
not.
absolutely
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
absolutely
not.
the
formulation...
and
this
was
used
in...
in
the
court's
decision
in
landon
v.
plasencia.
the...
the
question
is
there
are
no
constitutional
rights
in
connection
with
his
admission
to
the
united
states.
and
admission
means,
i
think,
both
formal
granted
admission
and
practical
admission
or
entry.
a
person
cannot--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he's
entitled
to
procedural
due
process
rights.
we
don't
believe
he...
that
person
has
any
more
substantive
due
process
right
to
remain
at
large
in
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
with...
with--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--with...
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--with
respect
to
the
regulations,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the...
the
ins
has...
or
now
dhs
has
applied
it.
i...
i
don't
know
that
there's
an
analysis
in
there
that
says
zadvydas
requires
it.
i
don't
think
the...
either
the
statute
or
particularly
the
constitution
would
give
somebody
who
sneaks
across
our
border
a
right
to
remain
here,
a
substantive
due
process
right
to
be
here.
maybe
procedural
rights
would
be
different,
but
a
substantive--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
because
those
were
lawful
permanent
residents
whose...
whose
lawful
permanent
residency
had...
had...
they
came
in
under
a
grant
of
lawful
permanent
residency.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
because
these
aliens
entered
the
united
states
only--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
someone...
someone
who
would
be
picked
up
would
be
an
applicant
for
admission
and
could
be
released
under
this...
under
this
statute.
but...
but
focusing
here
on
the
people
excluded
at
the
border--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
is
the
only
way
someone
could--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he
would
be
an
applicant
for
admission,
and
the...
i...
i
believe...
i
believe
i'm
correct
on
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
act
treats
him
as
an
applicant
for
admission
under
1225(a)(1).
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
souter,
you're
exactly
right
in
terms
of
why
the
statutory
construction
or
statutory
application
of
the
terms
in
zadvydas
does
not
control
here.
the
court's
starting
point...
again
back
to
page
682
of
its
opinion,
it
says,
we
deal
here
with
aliens
who
were
admitted.
the
way
the
court
dealt
in
the
opinion
was
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
and
it
did
it
by
reading
into
the
statute
a
reasonable
time
limitation.
what
is
reasonable
for
aliens
who...
who
have
been
admitted
and
are
subject
to
what
were
called
deportation
is
different
from
aliens
who
were
stopped
at
the
border.
and
in
fact,
in
the...
in
the
court's
statutory
analysis,
it
looked
to
the
point
that
in
the
witkovitz
jurisdictional
statement
referring
to
congress'
constitutional
doubts
about
detention
of
more
than
6
months,
those
were
constitutional
doubts
about
people
who
were
being
deported
after
having
been
allowed
to
be
here.
there
has
never--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it...
with
respect...
with
respect,
it
has
not.
and...
and
if
i
could...
if
i
could
explain
this.
this...
going
back
to
mezei,
this
court
held
and
in
fact
rejected
a
very
similar
argument.
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
mezei
was
that
deportable
aliens
are
subject
to
an
express,
not
an
implied,
6-month
limitation.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
aliens
in
that...
the
alien
in
that
case,
once
he
couldn't
be
removed
to
another
country,
should
be
released
because
the
purpose
of
keeping
him
to
return
him
to
another
country
was
no
longer
being
served.
this
court
rejected
that
argument,
even
though
there
was
a
statutory
express
limitation
of
6
months
for
deportable
aliens,
held
that
an
alien
who
had
been
on
ellis
island
for
2
years
did
not
have
to
be
released.
in
reliance
on
that
decision,
congress
passed
the
parole
statute
to
leave
the
release
in...
excuse
me...
mezei
was
after
it,
but
the...
the
executive
branch
has
relied
on
that
rationale.
the
cuban
review
regulations
that
are
at
issue
here
have
been
in
place
for
15
years
under
the
parole
statute.
as
congress
well
knew,
when
it
acted
in
1996,
the...
this
program
was
the
subject
of
many
hearings
in
congress.
there
were
cases...
the
barrera
case
out
of
the
ninth
circuit
sustained
a
10-year
detention
of
a
mariel
cuban.
it
is
implausible
to
believe
in
1996,
when
congress
enacted
iirira,
that
it
intended
to
cut
back
on
the
longstanding
power
of
the
executive
branch
to
prevent
hordes
of
aliens
from
coming
into
our
country
and
to
impose
an
arbitrary
6-month
limitation.
i...
i
think
there's
no
argument
that
if
an
alien
is
detained
before
removal
proceedings
are
begun,
that
there
is
no
6-month
limitation.
his
release
is
entirely
up
to
the
attorney
general
under
the
parole
regulations.
it's...
it's
implausible
to
believe
that
once
congress
actually
enters
a
formal
order
of
exclusion
or
now
removal
against
an
alien,
the
person
is
no
longer
in
an
ambiguous
situation,
the
executive
branch
says
you're
not
eligible,
that
suddenly
that
person
who
has
been
formerly
found
not
eligible,
would
be
subject
to
a
6-month
limitation
that
did
not
apply
up
until
'96
and
doesn't
even
apply
until
these...
to
these
aliens
until
removal
proceedings
have
been
begun.
so
the
right
way
to
look
at
this
statute
as
what's
a
reasonable
time
under
1231(a)(6)
has
to
take
into
account
that
historic
background
of
the
united
states
being
able
to
protect
its
borders.
and
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
that
congress
intended
to
overrule
this
longstanding
program
for
mariel
cubans,
which
has
operated,
as
i
said,
for
15
years.
