how
would
that...
how
would
that
apply
to
someone
who
hasn't
gotten
parole,
hasn't
gotten
any
permission,
who
snuck
across
the
border?
that's
one
of
the
pieces
of
this
that's
incomprehensible,
that
you
are
suggesting
someone
can
be
detained
indefinitely
who
we
allowed
in
temporarily,
but
such
treatment
could
not
occur
with
respect
to
somebody
that
had
no
permission
at
any
time
to
be
here.
justice
ruth

which
can
be
revoked.
which
can
be
revoked,
and
that's
the...
the
distinction
that
seems
to
me
strange.
when
somebody
commits
a
deportable
offense,
they
are
stripped
of
whatever
right
they
had
to
be
here.
they
are,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
same
boat
as
someone
who
is
excludable.
they...
they
do...
do
not
have
any
right
to
remain
no
more
than
a
parolee
has.
we
have
taken
away
their
right
to
remain.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
no
status
anymore
based
on
a
prior
admission
that
we
have
removed
from
them.
justice

but
is
that
the
current
ins--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it
wouldn't...
it
wouldn't
apply
to
the
illegal
alien
because
it's
a
statute
that
governs
parole
and
they're
not
paroled
into
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
does
that
make
that
person,
the
illegal
entrant,
a
parolee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
apply
for
admission.
i
just
don't
want
to
be
locked
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
with
the
1182?
because
suppose
you
prevail
on
your
argument
that
it's
the
same
statute,
the
same
word,
it
can't
be
construed
differently
under
12-whatever,
and
the
government
says
fine.
we
now
go
to
the
other
string
in
our
bow
and
we
continue
to
detain
this
person
on
the
basis
of
1182(d)(5)(a).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
long
had
the...
the
detainee
in,
however
you
pronounce
it,
mezei
lived
in
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you...
how
do
you
answer
the
government's
argument
that
this
is
necessary,
that
the
united
states
shouldn't
effectively
be
punished
for
being
humanitarian,
and
if
we
can't
hold
these
people,
if
we're
forced
to
let
them
in,
then
any
rogue
nation
can
dump
anyone
it
wants
on
the
united
states
and
we
can't
stop
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought...
maybe
i...
i
misunderstood
you,
but
i
thought
that
one
of
your
points
were
even
assuming
that
we
couldn't
send
these
people
back
into
cuba
without
having
a
major
conflagration,
the
rogue
dictator
is
not
going
to
be
deterred
by
our
tossing
even
into
the
sea
the
people
that
he
doesn't
want.
