justice
john
paul

but,
mr.
kneedler,
recognizing
that
distinction,
is
that
a
distinction
drawn
by
the
statute
that's
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
kneedler,
can
i
ask
you
a
question,
forgetting
the
statutes
for
a
moment...
i...
which
we've
already
covered
at
some
length?
just
going
to
your
constitutional
position,
it's
clear
that
a
person
who's
not
been
admitted
and
has
been
paroled
could
be
excluded
forthwith,
summarily,
and
so
forth
because
he's
never
been
admitted.
but
does
that
person
have
any
protection
under
the
constitution?
could
we
shoot
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what
is
the
protection
under
the
constitution
that
deals...
is
it
the
due
process
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
he...
is
he
a
person
within
the
meaning--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
is
he
a
person
who
has
a
right
to
liberty,
entitled
to
some
protection,
very,
very,
very
minimal,
but
there
is
some
protection
to
that...
that
individual.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
context
is
he
got
off
a
boat.
we
couldn't...
but
cuba
won't
take
him
back
or...
or
whatever...
wherever
he
came
from.
they
can't.
and
the
only
thing
we
can
do
to
keep
him
out
of
the
country
is
to
keep
him
in
jail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he...
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
be
released.
but...
but
you
do
not
contend
that
we
could
kill
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
does
have
some...
some
minimal
protection
under
the
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
you
believe
the
supervision
after
the
90-day
period
covered
in
subparagraph
3...
is
there...
can
that
continue
indefinitely
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
think
it
really
said
they...
they
found
there
was
a
security
risk.
they...
they
held
the
government
did
not
have
to
explain
because
the
man
had
no
right
to
come
in.
