justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
court
held
only
3
years
ago
that
the
statute
before
us
here
does
not
permit
the
attorney
general
to
hold
the
alien
indefinitely.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
statute
just...
just
goes
in
a
circle
because
it
ends.
the
way
end...
(a)
ends
is
that
after
revoking
the
parole,
the
alien
shall
forthwith
return
or
be
returned
to
the
custody
from
which
he
was
paroled
and
thereafter
his
case
shall
continue
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
same
manner
as
that
of
any
other
applicant
for
admission
to
the
united
states,
which
refers
you
back
to...
to
1231(a)(6).
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
shall
continue
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
same
manner
as
that
of
any
other
applicant--
justice
antonin
scalia
--dealt
with
includes,
it
seems
to
me,
1231(a)(6).
justice
antonin
scalia
by
which
you
mean...
parole
statute,
by
which
you
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
an
interpretation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says...
that's
an
interpretation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
the
statute
does
not
confer
power
to
hold
beyond
a
reasonable
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
kneedler,
may
i...
may
i
try
to
get
in
the
question
i
did
earlier?
is...
is
8
u.s.c.,
section
1182(d)(5)...
was...
was
that
applicable
in
zadvydas,
as
it's
applicable
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
is
a
new
string
to
your
bow
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
get
to
that,
do
you
think
that
that's
the
only
statute
applicable
here?
what
about
1182(d)(5)?
what's
your
response
to
the
government's
assertion
that
that's
an
independent
basis?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there's
no...
and...
and
there's
no
answer
to
justice
souter's
question
with
regard
to
people
who...
who...
once
they
enter
that
way.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
a
new
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
normal,
harmless
criminals.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this...
this
regime
is
not
sending,
you
know,
an
armed
flotilla
to
florida.
they
just--
[laughter]
--they
just
open
their
jails
and
say,
hey,
you
know,
go
wherever
you
want.
and
these
people
say
i
want
to
get
out
of
here,
and
they
go
to
florida.
you...
you
want
us--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
bomb
cuba
because
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
have
been
a...
a
means
of
warning
congress
off
one
area,
but
not
the
other.
that
is
to
say,
just
because
we
think
there's
a
constitutional
doubt
here
and
therefore
congress
might
be
sailing
close
to
the
wind
if
they
tried
to
overrule
our
opinion
by
statute
doesn't
mean
that
congress
couldn't
in
this
other
area
alter
the
result
in
zadvydas.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
i
dissented
in
that
case.
so
i'm
not
saying
this
was
a
good
idea.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce,
equally
turgid,
is
clark...
it
is
two
cases
actually,
no.
03-878,
clark
versus
martinez
and
no.
03-7434,
benitez
versus
russels.
these
cases
come
to
us
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
and
the
eleventh
circuits
respectively.
sergio
suarez
martinez,
the
respondent
in
03-878,
and
daniel
benitez
the
petitioner
in
03-7434,
each
arrived
in
the
united
states
from
cuba
in
june
1980
in
what
is
come
to
be
known
as
the
mariel
boatlift.
both
of
them
were
paroled
by
the
attorney
general
in
to
the
country.
and
then
the
years
that
follow
both
were
convicted
of
a
series
of
criminal
offenses.
in
light
of
these
convictions
the
attorney
general
revoked
their
parole
and
instituted
removal
proceedings.
benitez
was
held
to
be
excludible
and
ordered
deported
in
1994.
martinez
was
held
to
be
in
admissible
and
ordered
removed
in
2000.
both
aliens
were
taken
into
custody
by
the
ins
in
late
2000
at
the
conclusion
of
their
prison
terms.
neither
could
be
removed
however,
because
of
cuba’s
refusal
to
accept
them.
as
a
result
they
continued
in
the
custody
of
the
federal
government.
each
alien
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
under
28
u.s.c.
section
2241
arguing
that
because
his
removal
from
the
country
was
not
reasonably
foreseeable
the
government
lacks
statutory
authority
to
continue
to
detain
him.
although
the
district
court
in
each
case
agreed
with
the
petitioner
that
removal
was
not
likely
to
occur
in
the
foreseeable
future.
the
district
courts
disagreed
on
the
significance
to
this
fact.
in
martinez’s
case
the
district
court
granted
the
writ
and
ordered
his
release.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
in
benitez’s
case
the
district
court
denied
relief
and
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
in
both
cases
and
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
reverse
that
of
the
eleventh.
when
an
alien
is
ordered
removed,
the
secretary
of
homeland
security
must
typically
remove
him
from
the
country
within
90
days.
during
which
times
the
secretary
may
hold
the
alien
in
custody.
as
these
cases
demonstrate
however
removal
within
90
days
will
not
always
be
possible.
the
secretary’s
authority
to
detain
aliens
beyond
the
90
day
period
is
governed
by
title
8
u.s.c.
section
1231(a)(6).
this
section
applies
to
three
classes
of
aliens
subject
to
removal
orders:
one,
aliens
like
those
before
us
today
held
to
be
inadmissible
under
section
1182;
two,
aliens
who
have
been
admitted
but
have
been
held
to
be
removable
under
sections
1227(a)(1)(c),
(a)(2),
or
(a)(4);
and
lastly
aliens
whom
the
secretary
determines
to
be
a
danger
to
the
community
or
a
flight
risk.
as
to
each
of
these
three
classes
however
the
statute
provides
simply
that
aliens
“maybe
detained
beyond
the
removal
period”.
in
a
case
called
zadvydas
versus
davis
decided
in
2001
we
interpreted
that
language
as
it
applies
to
the
second
class
that
is
to
aliens
who
have
previously
gained
admission,
to
permit
detention
only
for
so
long
as
reasonably
necessary
to
effect
removal.
we
said,
“once
removal
is
no
longer
reasonably
foreseeable
continued
detention
is
no
longer
authorized.”
the
question
presented
by
these
cases
is
whether
1231(a)(6)
must
be
read
to
place
the
same
limitation
upon
the
secretary’s
authority
to
detain
aliens
who
have
not
been
admitted.
we
concluded
it
must.
the
operative
statutory
language
“maybe
detained
beyond
the
removal
period
applies
equally
to
all
aliens
that
are
in
the
subject
of
the
verb".
it
allows
for
no
distinction
between
aliens
who
have
been
admitted
and
the
aliens
who
have
not.”
to
give
these
same
words
a
different
meaning
for
each
category
would
be
in
our
view
to
invent
a
statute
rather
than
interpret
one.
as
we
have
recognized
in
zadvydas,
the
statute
can
be
construed
literally
to
authorize
indefinite
detention
or
as
zadvydas
held,
it
can
be
read
to
suggest
“less
than
unlimited
discretion
to
detain”,
it
can
not
however
be
interpreted
to
do
both
at
the
same
time.
we
recognize
that
this
principle
of
construction
may
allow
non
admitted
aliens
to
benefit
from
constitutional
concerns
unique
to
admitted
aliens,
which
were
prominent
in
the
court's
opinion
in
the
zadvydas.
but
we
do
not
find
this
troubling.
it
is
not
all
unusual
to
give
a
statute's
ambiguous
language
of
limiting
construction
called
for
by
one
of
the
statute's
applications
even
though
other
of
the
statute
applications
standing
alone
would
not
require
the
limitation.
the
lowest
common
denominator,
sort
of
speak,
must
govern.
if
one
plausible
construction
of
a
statute
would
raise
a
multitude
of
constitutional
problems
the
other
construction
should
prevail,
whether
or
not
those
constitutional
problems
pertain
to
the
particular
litigant
before
the
court.
for
reasons
set
forth
in
our
opinion
we
reject
the
government's
recharacterization
of
the
zadvydas
as
having
held
simply
the
1231(a)(6)
“authorizes
detention
until
it
approaches
constitutional
limits”,
and
the
governments
suggestion
that
is
detention
of
the
aliens
in
these
cases
was
authorized
not
by
1231(a)(6)
but
by
1182(d)(5).
in
sum,
1231(a)(6)
authorizes
the
detentions
of
non
admitted
aliens
for
as
long
as
reasonably
necessary
to
affect
their
removal.
since
the
government
has
suggested
no
reason
why
the
period
of
time
reasonably
necessary
to
affect
removal
of
such
an
alien
is
any
longer
than
that
required
for
an
admitted
alien
was
the
petitioner
in
the
zadvydas.
the
6-month
presumptive
detention
period
set
forth
in
the
zadvydas
applies
here
as
well.
the
aliens
in
these
cases
were
detained
for
more
than
six
months
beyond
the
date
they
were
ordered
removed
and
it
is
uncontested
that
their
removal
is
not
expected
in
the
foreseeable
future.
therefore
the
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
should
have
been
granted.
the
government
fears
that
this
result
will
compromise
the
security
of
our
boarders
by
forcing
the
release
into
society
of
inadmissible
aliens
who
can
not
be
removed.
the
extent
of
that
risk
should
not
be
exaggerated.
shortly
after
our
decision
in
zadvydas,
congress
enacted
a
statute
authorizing
continuing
detention,
specifically
authorizing
continuing
detention
of
aliens
who
present
a
national
security
threat
or
who
have
been
involved
in
terrorist
activities.
but
to
the
extent
a
risk
of
releasing
undesirables
into
the
society
remains
congress
can
attend
to
it.
for
this
court
however
to
sanction
indefinite
detention
in
the
phases
of
zadvydas
would
establish
within
our
jurisprudence
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
remedy
the
dangerous
principle
that
judges
can
give
the
same
statutory
text,
different
meaning
in
different
cases.
this
we
decline
to
do.
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed
and
that
of
the
eleventh
reversed.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined
as
to
part
1a.
