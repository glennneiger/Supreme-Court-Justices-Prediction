argument
next
in

03-878,
clark

mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kneedler.
ms.
dahl,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
explain
then,
ms.
dahl,
the
language
in
the
court's
zadvydas
opinion
that
had,
were
we
dealing
with,
in
effect,
off-shore
aliens,
this
would
be
a
much
different
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
a
person,
even
though
they're
not
lawfully
admitted
into
the
united
states,
still
couldn't
be
indefinitely
detained.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
government
distinguishes
that
case.
what
do
you
make
of
their
distinction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are...
are
the
people
here
charged
with
any
sort
of
terrorist
activities?
they
were
committed...
convicted
of
crimes,
but
i...
i
didn't
think
they
were
connected
with
terrorist
activities.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
except
that
with
aliens,
they
can
be
deported,
whereas
a
citizen
can't
be,
upon
release
from
prison.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
dahl.
mr.
mills,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you...
you
might
wait
a
while
if
you
went
to
the
united
nations
or--
[laughter]
--or
to...
i
take
it
the
government
feels
you
need
some
sort
of
a
rather
immediate
recourse.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
explain,
mr.
mills,
the
language
that
the
court
used,
pointing
out
how
different
this
kind
of
a
case
would
have
been
from
the...
from
the
zadvydas
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mills.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
