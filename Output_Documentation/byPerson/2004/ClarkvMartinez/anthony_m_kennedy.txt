justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are...
are
you
saying
that
if
an
alien
on...
who
seeks
admission
and
is
denied
admission
and
is
at
ellis
island
or
the
jkf
airport,
that
the
attorney
general
is...
does
not
have
to
consult
1231(a)(6)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if...
if
there's
a
statute
that
directs
you
with
reference
to
a
class,
that
statute
is
applicable,
and
this
person
is
within
that
class.
so
how
can
you
tell
us
we
can't
go
or
that
we
needn't
go
to
1231?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
might
be
exclusive
constitutionally,
but
the
congress
has
acted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
once
it's
acted,
you're
controlled.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
you're
saying
is
that
even
if
1182
comes
first,
1231
comes
second.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
take--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
want
us
to
take
judicial
notice
that
the
mexican
border
and
american
border
is
impervious?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
a
policy
decision
either
way.
i...
i
suppose
if
zadvydas
had
come
out
the
other
way,
the
congress
could
have
responded
as
well.
