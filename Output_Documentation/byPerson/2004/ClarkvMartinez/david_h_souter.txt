but
may
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
interrupt
you
there,
mr.
kneedler?
because
i
mean,
the
question
is
whether
constitutionally
we
should
respect
that
presumption.
and...
and
my...
my
question
basically
is
this.
i
can
perfectly
well
understand
and
i
can
understand
the...
the
argument
for
respecting
that
presumption.
when
you're
dealing
with
excluded
aliens
who
are
in
a
literal
territorial
sense
within
the
border
but
are
never
allowed,
in
effect,
beyond
a
point
of
initial
custody,
the
ones
who
are
kept
at
ellis
island
or
wherever
one
may...
may
keep
them.
it
is
difficult,
however,
i...
i
think
to
accept
what
has
been
called
the...
the
fiction
of
custody.
when
we
are
dealing
with
individuals
who,
although
absolutely
excludable,
were
nonetheless
welcomed
into
the
united
states
by
a
public
announcement
of
the
president
of
the
united
states,
have
been
allowed
into
the
american
population,
just
as
clearly
and
as
readily
as
they
would
have
been
under
any
other
protocol
of
admission...
and
i
guess
in
this
case
for
something
like
20
years...
isn't
there
a
point
at
which
the...
the
fiction
of
exclusion
simply
cannot
be
accepted
for
constitutional
purposes?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
factually.
they're
allowed
into
the
country.
you
know,
they
can
get
jobs,
own
property,
et
cetera.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i
realize
but
they
are
admitted
in
the
sense
that
they
say,
okay,
you
can
come
in
and
you
can
do
these
things,
but
you
get
no...
in
effect,
you
get
no
vested
right.
we
can
take
it
away
like
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
otherwise...
otherwise
they
are
treated
like
any
other
class
of
aliens
who
are
admitted
into
the
united
states.
they
are
subject
to
this
condition.
the
united
states
makes
that
clear,
but
they
nonetheless
can
be
in
the
country
and
do
in
the
country
what
other
aliens
can
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
know.
subject
to
that
condition.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i...
i
realize
that,
but
the
problem
is
you've
got
a
due
process
clause
that
talks
about
persons
not
citizens.
maybe
i
can
understand
the...
the
fiction
that
says
it
doesn't
apply
to
these
persons
if,
for
practical
purposes,
we
stop
them
at
the
border
and
we
don't
let
them
into
society.
once
we
do
let
them
into
society,
whether
we
say
it's
subject
to
this
condition
it
can
be
revoked
or
not,
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
a
constitutional
warrant
for
drawing
the
line
that
you
want
us
to
draw.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
giving
me
prior
examples,
but
the
issue
here
is
should
we
continue
to
respect
that...
what
has
been
called
that
fiction
as
to
people
who
are
allowed
into
the
country
and
are
allowed
to
move
around
like
other
aliens
and,
indeed,
and
by
and
large
like
citizens.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
i
can...
i
can
agree
with
you
that
the
different
classes
are
going
to
implicate
different
considerations
on
what
is
reasonable.
but
you,
as
i
understand
it,
go
the
further
step
and
say
there
is
a
presumption,
and
perhaps
an
irrebuttable
presumption,
that
in
the
case
of
the...
the
legally
excluded,
even
though
they
are,
in
fact,
in
the
country,
the...
the
presumptive
reasonable
period
is
forever.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
where...
it's
that
stretch
that's
giving
us
the
trouble.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
true,
but
we've
got
to
say
something.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's...
what's
your
best
answer
to
the
government's
argument
that
unless
you
treat
this
case
differently
from
zadvydas,
at
least
for
purposes
of
reasonable
time
or
reasonable
interest,
which
affects
time,
the
united
states
is
basically
defenseless
against
countries
that...
that
want
to
dump
undesirable
aliens
and
force
them
into
the
united
states?
justice
david
h.
souter
because.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
defenseless
under
the
present
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
is
the
defense?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
are
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
they
can
actually
exclude,
in
practical
terms.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they...
in
any
case,
those
individuals
are
not
the
subject
of
sort
of
dumping
action
by
their
own
governments.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you...
you
skipped
a...
a
phrase.
it
says
when
the
attorney
general
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
purposes
of
the
parole
justify
nothing
more,
the
individual
shall
return
or
be
returned
to
the
custody
from
which
he
began.
and
their
argument
is
that
custody
is
different
in
these
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
you...
what
you
mean
when
you
say
we
can
forcibly
return
them
is
literally
we
can
take
them
to
guantanamo,
take
them
to
the
gate,
and
push
them
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
the
argument
that
the
statute,
in
effect,
limits
the...
our...
our
interpretation
limits
the...
the
detention
to
a
period
reasonably
related
to
the
government's
interest
in
accomplishing
that
interest?
that
interest
is
different
in...
in
the
case
of...
of
aliens
who
are
excluded,
if
we
accept
that
class
as
distinct
from
all
excludables.
and...
and
that
may
allow
a
much
longer
period
of
detention,
among
other
things,
to
deter
dictators
from...
from
dumping.
you've
given
us
an
answer
to
what
to
do
if
they
dump,
but
we
don't
want
them
to
dump
in
the
first
place.
that
argument
stops
short
of
saying
we
can
detain
them
for
life,
but
it
would
support
the...
the
position
that
on
a
consistent
interpretation
of
the
statute,
the
government
could
detain
them
longer
in
the
excluded
cases
than
in
others.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
is
only
one
class
of
excludables
by
the
government's
own
choice.
that's...
that's
basically
your
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
your...
what's
your
answer
to
mr....
mr.
mills'
position
that
the
government
has,
in
fact,
statutorily
waived
that
distinction
by
creating
one
class
of
excludables?
