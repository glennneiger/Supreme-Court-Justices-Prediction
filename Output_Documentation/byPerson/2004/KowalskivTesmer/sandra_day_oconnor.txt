justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
clarify
something
about
this
case?
are
any
of
the
indigent
defendants
whose
rights
the
respondent
attorneys
want
to
advance...
do
any
of
those
people
themselves
have
standing
to
bring
their
claims
in
federal
court
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
asking
if
there
are
any
individuals
now
before
this
court
in
this
case--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--who
would
be
available
and
who
would
have
remedies
or
standing
to
bring
their
claims.
are
we
just
talking
pure
hypotheticals
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
were
three
named
indigents.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
were?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
denied
counsel,
and
they
were
also
dismissed
at
some
point
down
the
line?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there...
there
is
a
cert
petition
filed
in
what
case?
in
the
june
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
your
point
is
that
there
are
petitions
filed
here
that
would
enable
this
court
to
decide
whether
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
correct
in
holding
the
statute
constitutional.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
acknowledge
there
is
a
good
federal
question
there
at
least?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
moran,
this
is
a
very
important
question,
whether
the
michigan
law
can
survive.
but
i
think
before
we
can
address
that,
we
have
to
decide
whether
there
is
standing
for
the
lawyers
you
represent
here
today,
and
that's
a
much
tougher
question
i
think.
is
it
possible
that
this
court
could
grant
certiorari
in
one
of
the
pending
petitions
and
resolve
the
underlying
issue
of
constitutionality
of
michigan's
unusual
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
we
were
to
grant
you
standing
here,
wouldn't
we
have
sort
of
expanded
our
existing
holdings
on
who
has
standing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
which...
which
indigent
defendants
are
the
attorney
plaintiffs
asserting
claims
on
behalf
of
here?
is
it
past
defendants?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you're
talking
about
the
two
individuals,
but
they've
been
dismissed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
indigent
criminal
defendants
are
these
attorneys
attempting
to
represent
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
future
defendants?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
past
defendants?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it's
past
defendants
who
were
convicted
and
didn't
have
counsel,
how
is
it
consistent
with
heck
v.
humphrey
that
they
could
be
here,
these
attorneys?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you
asserting
then
that
these
attorney
respondents
are
here
trying
to
represent
future
defendants?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
it's
present
defendants,
how
is
that
consistent
with
younger?
how
can
they
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it's
future
people,
how
is
it
consistent
with
los
angeles
v.
lyons?
i
mean,
i
just
don't
see
how
these
attorney
representatives
get
here.
