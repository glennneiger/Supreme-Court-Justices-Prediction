justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
is
an
injury
in
fact.
these
lawyers
claim
that
if
the
state
were
compensating
for
this
service
and
they're
on
the
list
to
be
appointed,
they
would
have
more
money
in
their
pockets.
you're
not...
you're
not
challenging
that
there
is
an
injury
in
fact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
you
said
now
you
were
going
on
to
the
prudential
factors,
and
so
i
asked
were
you
recognizing
that
there
was
an
injury
in
fact,
and
you
said
no.
and...
and
why
not?
because
it
seems
so
obvious
that
they
would
get
appointments
if
the
system
were--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
casey,
was
it
a
younger
abstention--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--with
respect
to
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
that
means
that
the
defendants
could
never
bring
this
1983
suit.
only
the
lawyers
arguably
could.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't...
didn't
the
michigan
supreme
court
already
rule
on
this
issue
and
said
that
the
statute
was
constitutional,
that
there
was
no
right
to
counsel,
therefore
no
possibility
of
appointing
counsel,
paid
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
going
through
the
state
system,
there's
no
possibility
that
these
lawyers
or
the
defendants
could
successfully
assert
a
right
to
paid
counsel--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
that's
already
been
decided
by
the
michigan
supreme
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there...
was
there
a
cert
petition
in
bulger
itself?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
was
denied.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
position
you've
taken
in...
in
the
halbert
case,
that
the
court
should
take
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
wasn't
true...
that
wasn't
true
in
the
pierce
v.
society
of
sisters
case
and
it
wasn't
true
in
the
singleton
case.
both
of
those
cases
recognized
third
party
standing,
although
the
prohibition
was
not
on
the
plaintiff
who
was
seeking
to
raise
the
rights
of
another
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
different
from
caplin
&
drysdale
where
the
lawyers
didn't
raise
the
interest
of
the
client
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
as
far
as
the
actual
client,
you
moved
to
dismiss.
so
that's
why
there's
no...
was
no
back-development.
you
moved
to
dismiss.
therefore,
you
have
to
assume
whatever
facts--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
favor
of
the
opponent
of
the
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
an
indigent
bring
a
1983
case?
i
thought
you
said
that
that
would
be
barred
by
younger.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
they?
because
i
thought
this
court
had
held
that...
that
you
can't
bring
a
1983
suit
if
what
you're
seeking
to
do
is
overturn
the
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
that...
that...
that's...
you're
saying
that
the
defendants
themselves
could
not
sue
now
under
1983?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
do
you...
do
you
agree
that
that's
right?
and
you
said
that
that's
their
theory,
that
they
could
bring
a
1983
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we...
do
we
know
whether
any
of
those
were
cases
that
didn't
fall
under
the
four
categories
where
you
a...
a
right
to?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
of
the
problems,
i
thought,
for
the
indigent
is
the
rulings...
am
i
correct...
in
michigan,
that
they're
not
required...
say,
there's
an
objection.
there's
no
written
record
that
the
indigent
could
look
to,
even
assuming
he
could
understand
it,
to...
to
determine
what
issues
might
be
raised
on...
on
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
true
that
michigan
is
the
only
state
in
the
union
so
far
that
denies
counsel
on
a
first
appeal,
whether
discretionary
or
mandatory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not...
not
the
right
of
appeal.
the
right
to
counsel,
whether
it's
a
mandatory
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was...
a
prohibition
was
on
the
parents
and
there
were
no
parents
as
plaintiffs
in
that
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--only
the
schools.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
a
problem,
wasn't
there,
in
singleton
that...
that
the
part
that
said
that
the
doctors
could
raise
the
patients'
right
as
opposed
to
the
doctor's
own
right
to
practice
or
whatever,
that
that
was
only
a
plurality?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
altogether
possible
there
had
been
a
young
man.
the
problem
was
he
turned
21.
so
the
case
would...
from
his
point
of
view
was
moot.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
a
practical
question
about
what
is
currently
before
the
court?
mr.
casey
i
think
told
us
that
the
halbert
case
is
on
for
the
october
8th
conference.
if
we
should
grant
cert
in
either
of
those
direct
from
the
michigan
supreme
court...
michigan
supreme
court
following
bulger,
so
you
always
leave
before
then.
if
we
should
grant
in
either
of
those
cases,
wouldn't
the
wise
thing
be
to
simply
hold
this
case
till
those
are
decided?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
said
now
he's
not
taking
that
position
in
the
halbert
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
familiar
with
the
halbert
case?
you
mentioned
that
there
might
be
a
finality
problem
in
harris.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
file
a
brief
in
opposition
in
halbert?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
does
that
have
any
procedural
impediments?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
was
the
basis
for
your
opposition
to
cert?
