justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
isn't...
isn't
the
biggest
distinguishing
factor
the
one
that
you
raised
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question?
these...
these
lawyers
can
represent
somebody
on
a
direct
appeal,
the
same
way
and
raise
exactly
the
same
issue
that
they're
trying
to
raise
on
third
party
standing
now.
isn't...
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
the
claim
that...
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if...
if
you
assume...
you
assume
the
correctness
of
the
allegations,
which
you...
you
have
to
do
at
this
point,
the
allegation
is
that
they
would
get
clients
and
would
be
paid
but
for
this
bar
to
payment.
isn't
that
correct?
so
if
you
take
them
in
terms
of
their
claim,
you've
got
to
assume
that
they
will
have
clients
and
they
can
bring
this...
this
issue
on
behalf
of
the
client.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
are
they
getting
at
when
they
say
merit?
i
mean,
i
take
it
you
concede
there
was
a
quotation
from
that
contineri
case
on...
cited
on
page
30
of
their
brief.
i
mean,
what...
what
is
the
reference
to
merit
supposed
to
mean?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
reasonable
thing
to
assume
that
they
use
it
as
we
would
normally
expect
it
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
mean
by
the
words
they
use?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
answer
that
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
say,
okay,
i
will
represent
him
but
i
am
representing
him
with
a
claim
for
funds?
and
at
the
end
of
the
day,
regardless
of
what
the
michigan
law
says,
i'm
going
to
say
to
the
state
of
michigan,
through
the
court,
pay
me
for
what
i
did.
that
isn't
a
waiver
and
there's
nothing
unethical
about
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
absolutely.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
could
accept...
i
guess
i
probably
would
accept
your
position
if
i
did
not
think
there...
there
was
another
equally
workable
alternative
here.
and
i
didn't
understand
your
answer
to
my
earlier
question
in
which
you
said,
if
i
recall
correctly,
that
it
would
be
unethical
for
these
lawyers
to
represent
a...
a
future
client,
subject
to
a
claim
to
be
paid
and
on
behalf
both
of
the
client
and,
i
suppose,
of
themselves,
but
essentially
on
behalf
of
a
client,
say,
there
is
a
right
to
state
money
to
pay
the
lawyer
who
is
representing
them.
it
would
be,
as
i
understood
you
to
say,
unethical
for
the
lawyer
to
proceed
on
that
basis.
and
i
don't
understand
the
reason
for
your
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
no.
i'm
assuming
they...
they
represent
the
client
for
all
purposes
and
one
of
the
client's
claims
is,
pay
my
lawyer.
i
don't
have
any
money.
your
statute
is
unconstitutional.
why
cannot
the
lawyer
pursue
that
claim
on
behalf
of
the
client
and...
and
raise
exactly
the
issue
that
is
being
raised
in
substance
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
that's
a
very
formalistic
answer.
the...
the
claim,
in
effect,
would
be
i
have
a
right
to
be
appointed
whatever
your
statute
says
because...
or
my...
the...
the
client
would
say
my
lawyer...
i
have
a
right
to
appointed
counsel,
whatever
your
statute
says,
with
the
consequence
of
payment.
so
to
say,
well,
they're
not
appointed,
that's
the
question.
should
they
be
appointed?
i
don't
see
why
they
cannot
raise
that
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
these...
these
lawyers
are
in
the
rotation.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
rotation
is
so
enormous
that
it
will
be
20
years
before
they
get
another
client?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
your...
your
claim
is
that
they
are
going
to
get
clients
in
the
future
and
they...
they
ought
to
have
a
right
to
be
paid
when
the
time
comes.
so
why
doesn't,
number
one,
a
lawyer
representing
the
next
client,
whoever
he
may
be,
have
a
right
to
raise
this,
and
why
doesn't
each
one
of
these
lawyers
have
a
right
to
raise
it
presumably
within
a
reasonable
time
when
they
next
come
up
in
the
rotation?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure
they
would,
and
that's
what
will
get
brought
to
this
court.
that's
what
we're
here
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
because
the
claim
is
that
they
have
a
right
under
federal
law
to
an
effective
procedure
whereby
paid
counsel
can
be
supplied
to
them.
that's
a
federal
issue,
not
a
state
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
all
you've
got
to
get
up
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
an
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
exactly
the
same
situation.
they
can...
they
can
bring
the
case
directly
for
the
client
they're
representing
just
as
readily
as
they
can
bring
this
one.
and
if
that
is
true,
why
is
there
an
impediment
to
raising
the
issue
unless
we
recognize
third
party
standing?
justice
david
h.
souter
without
being
paid
if
they
lose--
justice
david
h.
souter
--being
paid
if
they
win.
in
this
case,
if
they
win,
they
don't
get
a
dime
because
they're
not
representing
a
client.
all
they
get
is
a
declaration.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
they'd
be
better
off
to
represent
a
real
client.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
will
they
get
more
appointments?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
said
there's
a
strict
rotation
system.
when
your
name
comes
up,
you
get
an
appointment.
how
is
that
going
to
change
regardless
of
how
this
comes
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
you're
just
saying
there...
there's
going
to
be
a
further
class
of
clients
to
be
represented
on
the
rotation.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
that's...
that's
true.
