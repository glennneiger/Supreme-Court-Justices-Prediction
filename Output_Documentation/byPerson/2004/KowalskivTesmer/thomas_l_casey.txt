mr.
thomas
l.
casey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
facial
challenge
to
the
michigan
statute,
court
of
appeals
rulings
that
these
lawyers
have
third
party
standing
and
that
their
potential
clients
have
a
constitutional
right
to
appointed
counsel
in
discretionary
appeals
are
both
wrong.
first,
with
respect
to
the
standing
argument,
in
our
brief
we
argue
that
the
respondent
attorneys
could
not
meet
any
of
the
criteria
for
standing.
this
morning
i'd
like
to
focus
on
the
element
of
prudential
standing
that
considers
whether
there
is
a
hindrance
to
the
ability
of
a
third
party
to
protect
his
own...
to
protect
his
own
interest.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
in
our...
in
our
brief
we
have
challenged
that.
the...
the
requirement
is
that
there
be
an
injury
in
fact,
a
concrete
and
particularized
actual
or
imminent
injury
in
fact.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i...
i
am
not
waiving
the
argument.
i...
i
would
like
to
rest
on
the
brief.
but
i...
in
answer
to
your
question,
we
believe
yes,
there
is
a
likelihood
that
these
lawyers
on
the
list
for
appointed
counsel
will
some
day...
if
they
stay
on
the
list
and
a
case
comes
up
in
that
county,
there
is
a
likelihood
that
there
will
be
a
case.
we
submit,
however,
that
on
these
facts
in
this
facial
challenge,
we
don't
know
how
many
lawyers
are
on
the
list
for
appointments
in
saginaw
county.
we
don't
know
how
many
appeals
of
this
nature
come
up.
so
it
may
be
many
years
before
the
situation
arises.
this
is
not
a
concrete
and
particularized
actual
or
imminent
injury
in
fact,
and
we've
argued
that
in
the
brief.
at...
at
best,
if
there
is
an
injury
in
fact
and
if
there
is...
another
factor
is
the
close
relationship
to
the
third
party.
we
believe
those
are
weak
at
best,
and
we've
argued
in
our
brief
that
they
don't
exist.
i
think
it
is
most
clear,
however,
that
the
criteria
concerning
the
hindrance
to
the
third
party
does
not
exist
here.
this
is
a
facial
challenge
bought
by...
brought
by
lawyers
before
the
statute
took
effect,
claiming
not
that
the
statute
violates
their
own
constitutional
rights,
but
that
it
violates
the
rights
of
potential
future
clients,
and
that
the
lawyers
will
suffer
economic
harm.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
we
argue
that
there
are...
there
are
three
ways
that
an
indigent
defendant
can
bring
this
claim
themselves
without
having
to
rely
on
an
attorney
in
this
type
of
case.
first,
they
can
bring
the
challenge
directly
through
the
state
courts.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
no.
none
of
these...
none
of
these
defendants--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--in
this
facial
challenge,
we're
talking
about
pure
hypotheticals.
the...
the
three
named
indigent
defendants--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
they
were
denied
counsel.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
the...
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
federal
court
should
abstain
from
deciding
their
claims
because
they
could
have
brought
their
claims
in
their
direct
state
appeals.
they
raised
claims
about
the
practice
of
denying
counsel
before
the
statute
took
effect.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the...
the
sixth
circuit
en
banc
held
that
under
younger
v.
harris,
the
federal
court
should
abstain
from
deciding
the
claims
of
the
three
indigent
defendants.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
no.
younger
v.
harris
is
only...
only
defers
the
time
when
a
proper
federal
civil
rights
action
can
be
brought.
there
were...
at
the
time
this
action
was
brought,
there
were
pending
state
appeals
in
two
of
the
cases.
one
of
the
defendants
never
appealed
at
all.
the
sixth
circuit
recently
issued
an
opinion
not--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--your
honor,
perhaps
opposing
counsel
could
answer
that
better
than
i.
we
say
that
is
the--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that
is
our
point
on
the
standing
issue
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
in...
in
2000,
the...
the...
while
this
case
was
pending,
the
michigan
supreme
court
issued
an
opinion,
the
bulger
decision
that's
discussed
in
the
briefs,
saying
that
the
practice
of
denying
appointed
counsel
was
constitutional.
the
statute
was
not
in
effect
at
that
time.
the
statute
took
effect,
and
in
a
case
just
decided
in
june
of
this
year,
people
v.
harris,
the
michigan
supreme
court
relied
on
bulger
and
said
this
statute
is
constitutional.
it
does
not
violate
any
rights.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
as...
as
a
matter
of
jurisprudence
by
the
state
supreme
court,
yes.
both
state
and
federal
constitutional--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--there
are,
in
fact,
two
cases
pending,
the
harris
case
that
i
just
mentioned.
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
about
2
weeks
ago
raising
this
precise
claim.
there
is
another
case
halbert
v.
michigan.
it's
docket--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--there
was
a
petition
in
bulger.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
it
was
denied.
in...
in
addition--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--in
the...
the
case
is
pending
in
this
court
as
melody
harris
v.
michigan.
it
was
filed
about
2
weeks
ago.
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
out
the
docket
number.
there
was
another
case,
halbert
v.
michigan,
which
is
a
pro
se
defendant
who
was
denied
counsel.
his
applications,
pro
se
applications,
were
denied
in
the
state
appellate
courts.
a
pro
se
petition
was
filed.
i
filed
a
response
to
that
about
a
month
ago.
that's
docket
no.
03-10198.
it's
on
this
court's
conference
for
friday,
october
8th.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
there
are
at
least
those
two
petitions
pending
that
i'm
aware
of
in
this
court
now.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
oh,
yes.
it's...
it's
an
important
question.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we...
we...
in
the
bulger
case,
i
opposed
certiorari,
saying
that
yes,
it's
an
important
question,
but
it
was
correctly
decided.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
conflict.
then
when
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
came
up,
we
filed
the
petition
saying
it's
an
important
question
and
now
there's
a
conflict
between
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
federal
court
of
appeals.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
what
i
said
in
the
halbert
case
is
that
the
court
need
not
grant
this
petition
now
because,
although
it's
an
important
question,
the
issue
is
pending
in...
in
this
tesmer,
the
current
case,
kowalski
v.
tesmer.
if
this
court
rules
in
our
favor
on
standing
and
then
does
not
reach
the
constitutional
question,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
to
grant
certiorari
in
either
the
halbert
case
or
the
harris
case
because
the...
the
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
is
important
to
the
state
of
michigan.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
now,
the
halbert
petition
is
pro
se.
the
harris
petition
has
either
retained
or
pro
bono
counsel.
but
the...
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
is...
excuse
me...
is
directly
challenged
in
both
of
those
petitions.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
as
a
matter
of
judicial
economy,
there
is
a
point
to
be
made
that
it...
the
issue
has
been
briefed
and
argued.
so
perhaps
it
should
be
decided.
just
last
term
in
elk
grove
v.
newdow,
the
court
faced
a
similar
situation.
they
disposed
of
the
case
on
standing--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
true.
that's
true.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's...
that's
correct.
in
my
view,
the...
the
most
logical,
most
appropriate
disposition
would
be
to
say
that
these
attorneys
do
not
have
standing.
therefore,
reverse
the
sixth
circuit's
judgment.
there
are
these
other
vehicles
pending
now
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
well,
in
determining
prudential
standing,
there
are
several
criteria
that
should
be
examined
in
deciding
whether
there's
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
where
a
litigant
cannot
argue
the
rights
of
third
parties.
in
craig
v.
boren,
the
statute
directly
affected
the
vendor
in
that
case.
it
was
a
statute
against
sale
of
certain
alcoholic
beverages.
and
in
this
case
we
don't
have
that.
also,
in
craig
v.
boren,
nobody
argued
prudential
standing
considerations
until
the
case
reached
the
supreme
court
apparently.
but
in
our
case,
we
have
a
situation
where
we
have
lawyers
who
do
not
have
any
present
clients
who
are
not
directly
affected
by
the
statute.
they're
not
claiming
rights--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--well,
in...
in
craig
v.
boren,
the...
if
the
bartenders
did
not
comply
with
the
statute,
they'd
be
subject
to
criminal
penalties.
here,
the
attorneys
will
not
be
subject
to
any
criminal
penalties.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's...
that's
true.
the
parties
have
discussed
many
cases.
almost
all
of
them
have
some
factors
similar
to
the
circumstances
here,
and
as
we've
argued,
all
of
them
have
distinguishing
factors
too.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that...
precisely.
just
normal
principles
of
litigation
counsel
that
it
is
appropriate
to
have
a
real
party
in
interest.
the
criminal
defendants
whose
rights
are
at
stake
in
the
statute
litigate
that
case.
if
you
take
the
step
and
allow
standing
for
an
attorney,
based
on
speculative
claims
about
future
clients
and
economic
harm
to
the
attorney,
as
the
dissent
in
the
sixth
circuit
says,
that
opens
up
the
possibility
of
vastly
expanding
the
doctrine
of
standing
beyond
what
this
court
has
ever
said.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that
is
not
in--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that
is
not
in
the
record.
in
their
response
brief,
they
said
that
they
currently
do
have
clients,
but
in
the
complaint...
this
case
was,
again,
a
facial
challenge.
it
was
decided
on
summary
disposition
or
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss.
it
was
filed
and
decided
within
about
a
month.
and
there
was
no
factual
development
here.
if
they
had
actual
clients,
there
would
be
clearly
a
closer
relationship,
but
again,
those
clients
would
not
be
hindered
from
making
the
claims
themselves.
there
is
no
reason--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--in
our
view,
as
a
general
proposition,
lawyers
should
not
be
given
independent
standing
to
raise
claims
of
their
clients.
when
the
clients
can
present
their
own
issues
themselves,
as
they
can
in
this
case
or
in
this
situation
under
the
statute,
there's
no
need--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--again,
there
was
an
actual
client
in
that
case
and
there
was
significant
money
at
stake.
the
lawyers
had
been
paid
money
from
drug
forfeiture.
they
had
been
paid
$25,000,
and
they
wanted
another
107--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that...
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
but
my
response
on
that
was
to
the
question
of,
you
know,
do
they
in
fact
now
have
clients.
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
and
no
proof
that
they
now
have
clients.
they
may--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--correct.
that
goes
to
the
criteria
of
injury
in
fact
and
close
relationship
with
the
third
party.
we
still
have
the
criteria
that
i
wanted
to
discuss
this
morning
about
hindrance
to
the
right...
to
the
ability
of
the
third
party
to
litigate
for
themselves.
excuse
me.
in
our
view,
there
is
no
need
to
expand
the
doctrine
of
standing
to
permit
lawyers
to
have
independent
standing
to
make
these
claims
because
the
clients,
who
are
directly
affected
by
the
statute,
can
make
them
themselves.
there
are
the
two
pending
habeas...
or
two
pending
petitions
for
certiorari
that
we've
mentioned.
there
is
another
case,
the
bulger
case.
mr.
bulger
himself,
after
he
lost
in
the
michigan
courts,
he
filed
a
petition
for...
for
habeas
corpus.
and
the
district
court
granted
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
we
appealed.
that
case
is
now
pending
in
the
sixth
circuit.
so
that's
another
vehicle.
it
is
also
possible
that
an
indigent
inmate
himself
could
bring
a
section
1983
case.
it's
simply
not
necessary
to
expand
the
doctrine
of
standing
to
give
lawyers--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--if
they
had
a
pending
prosecution,
it
would
be
barred
by
younger.
once
that
pending
prosecution
is
over,
they
could
bring
a
1983
action.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
under
heck
v.
humphrey,
if
the
outcome
of
the
1983
case
would
necessarily
imply
that
the
conviction
or
sentence
is
invalid,
you
cannot
bring
the
1983
case.
here,
the
allegation
is
simply
that
they
were
entitled
to
counsel.
that's
not
the
substantive
merits
of
whether
the
claim...
whether
they
are
properly
convicted
or
properly
sentenced.
the
sixth
circuit,
in
a
case
decided
august
31st--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--a...
a
defendant
who
is
currently
in
the
state
system
on
direct
appeal
is
barred
by
the
abstention
doctrine
from
filing
a
1983
action.
but
after
they
go
through
the
state
court
and
lose,
in
addition
to
filing
a
writ
of
certiorari
with
this
court--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--oh,
certainly.
after...
after
they
go
through
the
state
court,
they
could
file
a
writ
of
cert
in
this
court,
as
the
two
pending
petitions
have.
they
could
file
a
complaint
for
habeas
corpus.
they
could
bring
a
facial
challenge
under
1983.
in
a
case
called
howard
v.
whitbeck
from
the
sixth
circuit,
just
decided
about
a
month
ago,
that
was
the
very
question
that
was
decided.
an
inmate...
a
prison
inmate,
challenging
another
statute,
litigated
and
lost
in
the
state
court,
then
filed
a
1983
action.
we
argued
in
a
federal
case
under
rooker
v.
feldman,
he
was
actually
trying
to
seek
review
of
the
state
court
judgment.
the
district
court
agreed.
but
the
sixth
circuit
just
said
rooker
v.
feldman
bars
the
as-applied
challenge,
but
they
remanded
for
a
trial
on
the
merits
of
the
facial
challenge,
which
is
not
barred
by
rooker
v.
feldman.
so
an
inmate
who
has
been
unsuccessful
in
the
state
court,
under
sixth
circuit
law
in
my
jurisdiction,
can
bring
a
1983
action.
so
there
are
at
least
three
vehicles
that
an
inmate
can
bring--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--we
are
not
filing
a
petition
for
certiorari
from
that
decision.
we
are
abiding
by
that
decision.
we're
going
back
and
we're
going
to
try
that
case
on
the
merits
of
the
facial
challenge
to
the
statute.
that...
that
case
is
howard
v.
whitbeck,
docket
no.
03-1396.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
true.
that...
that
gets
into
the...
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim.
and
in
our
view,
talking
about
the
merits,
all
that
is
required
in
the
michigan
application
for
leave
to
appeal
process
is
that
a
defendant
identify
the
issues
and
ask
the
appellate
court
to
review
it.
unlike
douglas,
this
is
not
a
review
on
the
merits.
an
order
denying
an
application
for
leave
is
not
an
affirmance.
it's
not
an
adjudication
of
the
merits
of
any
legal
issue.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
court
rules
concerning
applications
for
leave
do
not
set
out
specific
standards.
what...
what
the
court
of
appeals
can
do
on
an
application
for
leave
is
grant
the
application,
deny
it,
or
issue
peremptory
relief.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
are
no
published
standards
in
court
rule
or
statute
on
that.
the
court
is
free
to
exercise
its
discretion
to...
to
deny
leave
for
any
reason
that
it
chooses.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
if...
if--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--well,
if...
under
the
statute,
if
the
court
of
appeals
grants
leave,
counsel
is
automatically
appointed.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
they're...
most
often
they
are
sentencing
issues.
the
statistics
we
put
in
our
brief,
in
footnote
25
of
our
brief,
indicated
that
out
of
the...
in
2001,
there
were
38,000
guilty
plea
convictions.
the
court
of
appeals
that
year
disposed
of
7,600
cases.
14
percent
of
them
were
guilty
plea
appeals.
most
of
them
were
disposed
of
by
order.
there
were
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
about
50
decisions...
opinions
issued
in
guilty
plea
cases.
i
have
not
canvased
all
of
them.
i
suspect
that
the
vast
majority
of
them
are
sentencing
issues.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
in
every
case
where
there
was
an
opinion,
counsel
was
appointed.
the
statute
requires
it.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
believe
you're
incorrect
on
that,
your
honor.
the...
what
an
indigent
inmate
will...
or
defendant
will
have
available
to
him
to
prepare
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal
is
a
transcript
of
the
proceedings.
he's
entitled
to
that
for
free.
he
will
have
whatever
written
motions
and
written
decisions
the
trial
judge
may
have
issued.
he
will
have...
in
the
transcript,
he
will
have
the
oral
motions
and
the
decisions
of
the
judge,
and
then
in
addition
to
whatever
pro
se
materials,
as
in
the
ross
v.
moffitt
case,
the
inmate
can
muster.
in...
in
these
cases,
there
are
other
pro
se
materials
available.
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case
noted
that
there
is
a...
a
form
brief,
38-page
brief
that
was
circulating
among
inmates
on
the
precise
question
of
entitlement
to
counsel,
which
two
of
the
defendants
used
in
their
state
court
appeals.
but
in
determining
whether
counsel
is
constitutionally
required
under
ross
v.
moffitt,
this
court
has
said
you
look
to
two
things.
are
the
merits
decided?
what
is
the
nature
of
the
appellate
process?
and
if
the
merits
are
not
being
decided,
as
in
the
michigan
case,
we
say
that
falls
within
the
ross
v.
moffitt
line
of
cases,
unlike
the
douglas
case.
in...
in
addition
to
the
nature
of
the
appellate
proceedings,
he--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--a...
a
typical
order
that
the
court
of
appeals
issues
when
it
denies
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal
says,
denied
for
lack
of
merit
on
the
grounds
presented.
but
there
is
published,
controlling
michigan
authority,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
that
says
that
language
does
not
mean
that
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
merits
of
the
underlying
legal
issue.
what...
what
the
court
is
looking
at
is
the
question
of
whether
to
grant
leave
or
deny
leave.
if
they
grant
leave,
counsel
will
be
appointed.
in
a
very
real
sense--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--i...
i
do
not
know
why
the
court
of
appeals
uses
that
language.
what
i
do
know
is
that
the--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--well,
the--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--on
its
face,
that
would
be
the
first
impression
that
is
given
from
those
words.
however,
the
published
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
we've
cited
in
our
brief
reject
that,
and
they
say
that
in
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
adjudicating
the
merits.
my
opposing
counsel
in
this
case
was
counsel
of
record
in
the
bulger
case
in
the
michigan
supreme
court.
he
made
exactly
that
same
argument.
he
persuaded
the
dissent
in
that
opinion,
but
he
did
not
persuade
the
majority.
they
didn't
decide
the
issue
precisely,
but
he
has
been
arguing
that
ever
since.
but
the...
all
the
precedent
that
michigan
has
on
that
point
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
those
are
not
decisions
on
the
merits.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
believe
that
is
incorrect.
the
plaintiffs
have
cited
a
1987
habeas
corpus
case
that
purports
to
make
a
national
survey.
in
the
michigan
v.
bulger
michigan
supreme
court
opinion
in
footnote
3,
they
cited
a
1992
arizona
study
which
reached
almost
an
opposite
conclusion.
they
said
there
were
only
seven
states
which
give
unrestricted
right
of
appeal,
and
there
were
21
states
that
prohibited
appeals--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--it's
my
understanding
that
michigan
may
be
the
only
state
that
has
a
specific
statute
prohibiting
it
with
exceptions
like
this,
but
it's
also
my
understanding
that
the
practice
in
many
other
states
is
that
counsel
is
routinely
denied
in
appeals
from
guilty
pleas.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we
did
not
waive
any
of
the
standing
claims
in
this
case.
we've
discussed
that
in
our
reply
brief.
i've
cited
pages
of
the
briefs
where
these
issues
were
discussed.
and
the
overriding
fact
is
that
the
district
court,
the
three-judge
panel
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
en
banc
sixth
circuit
all
decided
these
issues.
they
have
been
properly
raised
and
preserved
and
they're
before
the
court.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes,
i
did.
i
filed
that
about
a
month
ago.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
not
to
my
knowledge.
that
individual
was
convicted
in
pleas,
asked
for
counsel
citing
the
federal
litigation
in
this
kowalski
v.
tesmer
case.
it
was
denied.
he
filed
a
pro
se
application
for
leave
to
appeal
challenging
the
denial
of
counsel
and
raising
his
sentencing
issues--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that
the
court
need
not
grant
cert
in
that
case
because
the
issue
is
pending
in
this
case.
if...
if
this
case
goes
away,
then
i
suspect
we
will
agree
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
vehicle
to
decide
the
constitutional
issue.
as
long
as
this
case
is
pending
in
which
the
issue
is
raised,
i
suggested
that
the
court
need
not
grant
cert
in
that
case
to
decide
the
issue.
if
the
issue
is
not
going
to
be
decided
in
this
case,
then
that
would
be
an
appropriate
vehicle
to
raise
and
decide
the
issue.
on
the
standing
point,
if
the
plaintiffs
here
are
given
standing,
it
would
be
a
significant
expansion
of
this
court's
standing
doctrine.
this
court
has
never
found
third
party
standing
when
a
litigant
is
not
directly
affected
by
a
statute
and
there
is
no
close
existing
relationship
with
the
third
party
and
there
is
no
hindrance.
we've
discussed
many
cases
in
which
some
of
these
factors
are
present
and
others
are
distinguishing
factors.
this...
this
case
is,
in
some
respects,
unlike
all
of
them.
there
would
be
a
significant
expansion
of
the
doctrine.
on
the
merits
of
the
issue,
a
constitutional
right
to
appointed
counsel,
under
the
michigan
system,
please
read
the
cases
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
particularly
the
bobenal
decision,
which
i've
cited
in
my
principal
brief.
in
a
footnote
in
my
brief,
i
quote
the
orders
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
considering.
they
have
the
same
language
that
is
at
issue
here.
controlling
michigan
precedent
says
that
applications
for
leave
to
appeal
are
not
decisions
on
the
merits.
all
an
inmate
has
to
do
is
identify
the
issues.
that
can
be
done.
it
has
been
done,
as
seen
by
the
two
pending
petitions
for
cert..
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
