what...
what
do
we
look
to
in
order
to
verify
what...
what
you've
just
said?
do
the
michigan
appellate
courts
catch
mistakes
all
the
time?
and
if
so,
what's
the
standard
that
they
use?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
are
the
standards
they
use?
where...
where
do
i
look
to
find
out
what
standards
they
use,
if
i
get
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
where
they
grant
leave
to
appeal,
and
if
not...
and
it's
not
one
of
the
exceptions
listed
in
the
statute
such
as
incorrect--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--such
as
incorrect
sentencing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
what
are
the
instances
in
which
they
grant
leave,
other
than
sentencing
or
some
other
statutory--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
in
triplett,
the
attorneys
themselves
were
subject
to
discipline.
they
were
raising
third
party
rights
in
order
to
defend
a
proceeding
brought
against
themselves.
it
seems
to
me
that's
distinguishable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
as...
as
to
triplett
and
boren,
you
can't
cite
those
two
cases
and
say
those
are
controlling
and
then
say,
well,
we've
never
held
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we've
said
that
triplett
and...
and
boren
are...
are
distinguishable,
and
you
said,
well,
we've
never
ruled
on
this
point.
well,
then
triplett
and
boren
aren't
controlling.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could...
could
you
give
me
an
example,
just
from
your
experience
in
practice,
where
there's
an
important
issue
raised
after
a
guilty
plea
that
requires
an
appeal
where
it's
not
one
of
the
statutory
exceptions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
most...
what
are...
what
are
those
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
sentencing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay,
but
that's
covered
by
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
instances
where
michigan
has
denied
the
right
to
appeal
when
those
claims
are
raised?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
waive
the
objection
to
prudential
standing--
