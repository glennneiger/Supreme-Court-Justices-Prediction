mr.
david
a.
moran
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
fact,
in
the
41
years
since
this
court's
decision
in
douglas,
no
state,
not
one,
not
even
a...
a
territorial
jurisdiction,
except
for
michigan,
has
even
attempted
to
deny
counsel
to
any
indigents
appealing
any
type
of
first
tier
appeal.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
is,
of
course,
possible,
justice
o'connor,
that
this
court
could
do
that.
mr.
david
a.
moran
not
at
all,
justice
o'connor.
this
case
fits
squarely
within
the
two
prior
lawyer-client
standing
cases,
the
triplett
case
in
which
this
court
unanimously
found
standing
for
a...
for
a
lawyer
representing
black
lung
claimants,
and
the
caplin
&
drysdale
case
in
which
this
court
found
standing
for
a
third
party
assertion
by
a
firm
representing
a
criminal
defendant.
and
what
those
three
cases
have
in
common
and
what
makes
them
unique
is
that
this
can
only
arise
in
a
case
in
which
the
statute
or
law
being
challenged
disentitles
the
client
either
through
loss
of
funding
or
through,
like
michigan's
law,
a
statute...
disentitles
the
client
to
representation.
any
other
change
in
the
law,
tort
reform
brought
up
by
my--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--mr.
chief
justice,
that
wouldn't
be
practical,
and
that
raises
a
point
that
justice
souter
also
raised
in
the
argument.
it
wouldn't
be
practical
for
mr.
fitzgerald
or
mr.
vogler
to
offer
their
services
pro
bono
to
some
indigent
in
this
position
because
to
do
so
would
probably...
probably
be
unethical
or
malpractice.
first
of
all,
they
can't
be
appointed.
what
the
statute
prohibits
is
the
appointment
of
counsel
like
mr.
fitzgerald
and
mr.
vogler.
so
they...
they
cannot
form
an
attorney-client
relationship
by
operation
of
law.
mr.
david
a.
moran
but
justice
souter,
that's
impractical
and
unethical
in
this
case
because
if
mr.
fitzgerald
and
mr.
vogler
were
to
do
that,
they
would
have
to
represent
the
indigent
on
his
or
her
underlying
plea
and
sentencing
issues--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--or
those
would
be
lost
forever--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--because
the
time
would
fly.
and
so
if
they
also
represented
him
on
the
underlying
plea
and
sentencing
issues,
then
this
person
would
not...
then
the
underlying
defendant
would
not
be
a
person
with
standing
to
raise
the
lack
of
counsel
because
in
fact
they
have
counsel.
mr.
david
a.
moran
this
was...
this
was...
for
mr.
fitzgerald
and
mr.
vogler,
they
were
challenging
both
the
prestatutory
practice
of
the
three
defendant
judges.
mr.
david
a.
moran
no.
mr.
fitzgerald
and
mr.
vogler,
justice
o'connor,
are
the
attorneys.
they
were...
they--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--they
routinely
take
appointments.
they
are
on
a
list
of--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--presently
and
future
defendants.
mr.
david
a.
moran
past
defendants.
they...
they--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
think
i...
i
think
i
misspoke.
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
it
had
not
gone
into
effect.
this
challenge
was
filed
in
order
to
prevent
the
statute
from
going
into
effect,
to
prevent
approximately
2,000
michigan
indigents
a
year
being
denied
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
david
a.
moran
present
and
future
defendants.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
they're
not
representing
any
named
defendants.
the...
the
problem
is
that
as
the
statute
goes
into
effect,
they
will
presumably
not
receive
any
further
funding
for--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
they're
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
bartender
in...
or
the
beer
vendor
in...
in
craig
v.
boren.
they're
representing
prospective
clients,
prospective
patients
as
in
singleton
v.
wulff
again.
this
court
has
over
and
over
again...
in
fact,
in
triplett
itself,
this
court
recognized
that...
specifically
said
that
in
triplett
that
it
applied
to
prospective
clients,
that
the...
and
it
said
that
in
triplett
that...
it
quoted
the
three
factors.
and
it
said
that...
excuse
me.
i'm
looking
at
the
wrong
page.
it
said
in
triplett
that
a
restriction
upon
the
fees
a
lawyer
may
charge
applied
to
the
lawyer's
prospective
client
of
a
due
process
right
to
obtain
legal
representation
falls
squarely
within
this
principle.
and
that
was
the
principle
of
third
party
standing
that
this
court
cited--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--but
justice
scalia,
this
court
has
never
held
that
such
a
restriction
is
a
condition
precedent
or
required
in
order
for
a
person
to
assert
third
party
rights.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
in...
singleton
is
a
case
in
which
there
was
no
direct
sanction
against
the
doctors
who
provided
medicaid
abortions.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
follow
that
question,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
i
think
you
have
ruled
on
this
court...
point
by
many
times
recognizing
that
even
persons
against
whom
the
statute
or
law
would
not
directly
affect...
for
example,
all
the
way
back
to
1925
with
pierce
v.
society
of
sisters,
there
was
no
legal
prohibition
against
the
school.
the
legal
prohibition
was
against
the
students
not
going
to
public
school.
so
80
years
ago
this
court
recognized
that.
in
a
situation
analogous
to
this,
the
school--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
it
was
the
school
that
was...
was
held
to
have
standing
to
assert
the
rights
of
future
and
current
students,
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
singleton
case
where,
again,
there
was
no
particular
restriction
against
the
doctors.
it
was
simply
that
they
would
not
get
funding.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that
was
a
plurality
portion
of
the
opinion.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
actually
we've
cited
it
in
our
brief
only
for
the
article
iii
proposition
which
this
court
unanimously
agreed
that
the
doctors
had
article
iii
standing
because
there
was
an
economic
energy--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--but
ultimately
this
court
in
singleton
allowed
the
doctors'
claim
on
behalf
of
the
patients
to
proceed.
i
understand
that
it
was
a
plurality
opinion
on
the...
on
the
jus
tertii
standing.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
think
i
might
have
misunderstood
your
question,
justice
souter.
the
question
i
understood
was
why
don't
they
represent
people
and
raise
only
the
entitlement
to
right
to
counsel.
in
the
bulger
case,
for
example,
the
michigan
supreme
court--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--if
that
attempt...
if
that
method
were
attempted,
mr.
casey
would
undoubtedly
argue
that
the
attorney
would
not
be
entitled
to
any
funding
because
the
attorney
was
never
appointed.
you
can't
just
go
out
and
find
indigents
that
you
would
like
to
represent.
you
have
to
be
formally
appointed.
mr.
david
a.
moran
the
problem
is
is
that
the
way
the
michigan
system
works,
it
works
on
a
strict
rotation
system,
and
so
there's
no...
there's
no
line-jumping
here.
there's
no
right
for
a...
a
client
to...
to
request
a
certain
attorney,
for
a
certain
attorney
to
go
the
head
of
the
queue
and
say
i
would
like
to
represent
that
fellow
and
be--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--no,
not
at
all.
they--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--they
routinely--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
think
it's
clear
that
the
michigan
courts
would
unquestionably
hold
that
a
lawyer
who
simply
inserts
himself
into
a
relationship
without
formal
court
appointment
is
not
entitled
to
be
paid.
mr.
david
a.
moran
but
the
problem
is,
justice
souter,
we
would
then
have
an
issue
of
michigan
law
inserted
as
to
whether--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that
part
is
a
federal
issue,
but
what
michigan--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--and
they
will
have
to
do
so
without
any
prospect
of
being
paid,
and
that's...
that's
the
problem.
mr.
david
a.
moran
they're
not
being
paid
for
this
lawsuit.
mr.
david
a.
moran
because
justice
souter,
they
would
have
to
represent
them
on
all
of
their
issues.
they
would
have
to
represent
them
on
their
plea
and
sentencing
issues
without
being
paid.
and
that's
not
what
they're
doing
in
this--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--in
this
litigation.
mr.
david
a.
moran
and--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--in...
in
this
lawsuit,
if
we
win
on
the
merits,
they
will
then
get
far
more
appointments
on
the
rotation
system
and
then
they
will
get
paid
for
those
appointments.
mr.
david
a.
moran
because--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--because
the
statute,
which
is
now
in
effect...
and
this
goes,
by
the
way,
back
to
the
issue
of
prudential
standing--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--correct.
far
more.
mr.
david
a.
moran
and...
and
while
this
court
considers
these
issues
of
prudential
standing,
thousands
of
michigan
defendants
will
be
denied
the
right
to
counsel--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--because
there...
there
was
no
person
in
position
at
the
time.
the
problem
was
we
had
to
file
this
litigation
before
the
statute
went
into
effect
because
once
the
statute
went
into
effect,
thousands
of
michigan
indigents
would
be
denied
the
right
to
counsel
every
year
and
would
suffer
probably
irreparable
damage
to
their
right
to
appeal--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--no.
mr.
david
a.
moran
your--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--your
honor,
the
only
kind
of
case
to
which
this
applies
is
a
case
exactly
like
triplett,
a
case
exactly
like
caplin
&
drysdale
where
the
claim
is
that
the
underlying
change
in
the
law
or
the
underlying
law
disenfranchises
or
disentitles
the
indigent
or
the
criminal
defendant
or
the
defendant
to
representation.
mr.
david
a.
moran
because,
first
of
all,
if
the
indigent
or
the
client
still
has
representation,
then
there
is
no
hindrance
to
the
third
party
raising
it
themselves.
mr.
david
a.
moran
because
the
client
could
raise
it
directly,
represented
by
the
attorney.
and
so
the
third
prong
in
jus
tertii
standing
would
be
clearly
missing
in
that
case.
mr.
david
a.
moran
but
this
court's
precedents
indicate,
justice
breyer,
that
the
indigents
do
have
a
significant
hindrance
to
filing
their
claims
themselves.
mr.
david
a.
moran
but
i
think--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
think
an
answer
i
need
to
give
to...
to
cut
through
all
of
this
is
that
third
party
standing
is
never
predicated
on
the
impossible.
third
party
standing
is
never
predicated
on
the
idea
that
third
party
standing
is
appropriate
only
if
it
is
impossible
for
some
indigent
to
make
it
into
court
or
some
third
party
or
the
person
whose
rights
are
being
violated
to
make
it
into
court.
all
that
must
be
shown
from
this
court's
precedents
is
a
hindrance.
so
this
court
did
not
require
in
craig
v.
boren
that
it
was
impossible
that
some
young
man
could
get
his
claim
in
front
of
the
court.
mr.
david
a.
moran
right,
but
this
court
never
suggested
that
it
was...
showing
that
it
was
impossible
for
someone
to
quickly
get
his
claim
before
the
court
was--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
the
problem
is
is
that
in
the
meantime
thousands
of
michigan
indigents
are
going
to
be
denied
counsel.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that
may
well
be
a
wise
course
of
action...
action,
justice
ginsburg.
i
should
point
out
that
mr.
casey,
when
he
filed
the
response
to
the
bulger
cert
petition,
brought
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
underlying
litigation
was
proceeding
in
a
case
that
was
then
called
tesmer
v.
granholm.
and
so
he
brought
to
this
court's
attention
that
we
had
already
prevailed
in
federal
district
court
in
tesmer
v.
granholm
as
a
suggestion
as
to
why
this
court
did
not
need
to
grant
cert
in
the
bulger
case,
and
so
this
court
did
not
grant
cert
i
don't
know,
of
course...
i
don't
know
why
this
court
did
not
grant
cert
in
bulger.
mr.
david
a.
moran
but
i
can
be
confident
that
if
there
are
any
procedural
hurdles
to
this
court's
exercise
of
jurisdiction
in
any
of
the
state
cases,
mr.
casey
will
alert
this
court
of
them.
and
there
may
well
be.
for
example,
in
the
melody
harris
case,
the
michigan
supreme
court
remanded
for
further...
remanded
for
her
to
then
file
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal
on
her
underlying
plea
and
sentencing
issues
without
the
assistance
of
counsel.
was
the
michigan
supreme
court's
order
a
final
order?
i
don't
know.
this
court
would
obviously
have
to
resolve
that.
but
i
can
be
confident
that
mr.
casey
will
certainly
bring
up
any
procedural
hurdles.
and
of
course,
this
court
cannot
exercise
jurisdiction
it
does
not
have
in
a
case
just
because
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
do
so.
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
the
petitioners
never
challenged
prudential
standing
at
any
point
in
this
litigation...
they...
they
challenged
only
article
iii
standing,
injury
in
fact...
until
this
court.
and
so
part
of
the
reason
we
don't
have
a
better
record
is
because
this
came
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
this
court
recognized
in
lujan
that
a
motion
to
dismiss
is
different
than
a
summary
judgment,
requires
a...
a
different
procedural
posture.
it
requires
the
assumption
of
facts
being
true.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
agree
with
you
on
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
agree
with
you,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
this
court
has
said
so
many
times,
and
powers
v.
ohio,
for
example,
noted
the
impediment
to
the--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
don't
believe
in
all
of
the
cases
that
both
parties
cited
that
there
are
any
cases
in
which
this
court
has
said
that
there
was
no
impediment
to
the
third
party.
it
is...
it
is
certainly
not
the
standard--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--not
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
didn't
mean
to
be
light
about
that.
mr.
david
a.
moran
there...
we...
we
fully
concede
there
need
to
be
an
impediment,
but
what
it
does
not
require
is
the
showing
that
it
is
impossible
for
someone
to
get
here.
what
is
a
showing
is
that
for
most...
for
the
average
person
in
the
class,
just
like
the
average
grand
juror
in
campbell
v.
louisiana,
or
the
average
venire
person
in
powers
v.
ohio,
there
are
impediments
to
getting
here.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i'm
willing
to
concede
that
because
it
is
so
clear
to
me
that
there
is,
that
there
is
an
impediment
that
trying
to
get
into
federal
court,
trying
to
get
here,
for
that
matter,
trying
to
get
into
federal
district
court...
for
an
indigent,
a
typical
person
who
is
very
likely...
someone
like
mr.
carter,
functionally
illiterate,
poorly
educated,
completely
unaware
of
his
rights,
to
try
and
navigate
the...
the
procedural
hurdles
of
the
michigan
system
to
get
all
the
way
through
the
michigan
system
and
then
into
federal
court,
that
is
a
daunting
hurdle.
and
that's
evitts
v.
lucey.
this
court
has
recognized
time
and
time
again
in...
in
plea
cases,
roe
v....
roe
v.
flores-ortega.
this
court
has
recognized
time
and
time
again
in
peguero
that
even
in
a
plea
case
a
typical
indigent
is
completely
incapable
of
getting
his
or
her
case
held...
heard,
especially
if
you
have
to
go
through
multiple
layers
of
appeal
without
a
counsel
for
the
first
tier.
and
that
is
the
problem
here.
on
the
merits,
i
certainly
would
like
to
correct
mr.
casey's
representations
about
the...
the
nature
of
the
michigan
system.
the...
a
properly
filed
application
for
leave
to
appeal
is
invariably
denied
for
lack
of
merit
in
the
grounds
presented.
i
certainly
urge
this
court
to
look
at
each
and
every
one
of
the
cases
that
mr.
casey
has
cited
for
the
proposition
that
that
is
not
a
determination
on
the
merits
because
not
one
of
them
says
that.
not
one
of
them
specifically
says
that
a
order
denying
leave
for
lack
of
merit
on
the
grounds
presented
is
not
a
decision
on
the
merits.

mr.

that
is
a
sentencing
error.
mr.
david

moran
no,
it's
not.
the

the
only
exceptions
in

mr.
david

moran
--and
for...
and
then
if
the
indigent
gets
the
appeal
granted,
but
that's
putting...
that's
after
the
indigent
has
had
to
file
an
application
identifying
his
or
her
own
issues
without
any
assistance
of
counsel.
double
jeopardy
issues.
double
jeopardy
issues
arise
in
michigan
all
the
time;
whether
sentences
should
be
consecutive
or
concurrent;
whether
there's
been
a
breach
of
the
plea
bargain.
all
of
these
issues
arise
in
michigan
courts
every
day,
and
while
we
are--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--the
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
an
indigent
can't
raise...
a
typical
indigent
would
be
completely
incapable
of
identifying
this...
these
sorts
of
issues.
mr.
david
a.
moran
your
honor,
michigan
requires
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
be
raised
on
direct
appeal.
so
if
counsel
has
not
raised
the
issue,
then
the
indigent
would
have
to
recognize
that
by...
by
himself,
and
then
raise
that
issue,
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
on
direct
appeal.
further,
even
if
counsel
has
recognized
it,
what
we
typically
would
have
would
be
an
oral
objection
at
a
sentencing
hearing.
for
example,
your
honor,
i
think
these
sentences
should
be
concurrent,
and
the
judge
says,
no,
i'm
going
to
make
them
consecutive.
that's
an
oral
objection.
the
indigent
will
have
to
be
able
to
get
the
transcripts,
get
the
register
of
actions,
get
all
the
necessary
documents,
realize
that
that's
a
winning
issue,
that
it
does
not
put
him
at
additional
risk.
that's
another
factor.
one
of
the...
one
of
the
points
that
a
counsel
can
help
with
is
tell
an
indigent,
you
don't
want
to
take
this
appeal
because
success
may
result
in
revocation
of
the
plea
bargain
and
an
additional
risk...
will
have
to
realize
that
this
is
in
my
best
interest
to
go
ahead
with
this
appeal.
this
is
my
issue.
find
the
cases,
find
the
controlling
authority.
and
even
issues
as
complex
as
a
blakely
issue,
which
this
court,
of
course,
will
be
dealing
with
this
afternoon,
that
is
an
open
issue
of
michigan
law
right
now.
is...
are
the
michigan
sentencing
guidelines
unconstitutional
or
at
least
the
application
of
them
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
blakely?
right
now,
as
a
result
of
the
order
in
melody
harris,
a
typical
michigan
indigent
will
have
to
raise
that
complex
issue
of
sixth
amendment
law
by
herself
or
by
himself,
and
that's
simply
an
impossible
burden,
or
the
issue
will
be
lost
forever.
and
that
is...
that
is
a
burden
that
no
indigent
can
meet.
and
so
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
not
get
hung
up
on
the
standing
issue
because
this
issue
is
so
important
right
now,
as
a
result
of
the
michigan
supreme
court's
order.
right
now
these
issues
are
happening
and
right
now
michigan
indigents
are
being
denied
the
assistance
of
counsel.
unique
in
the
nation.
and
so
this
case
has
been
adversely
argued.
that's
the
point
of
prudential
standing.
the
petitioners
waived
the
prudential
standing
issues
below.
they
challenged
only
article
iii
standing.
and
so
there
is
every
reason
for
this
court
not
to
wait
for
a
perfect
case
that
may
never
come.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case,
your
honor.
i
just
became
aware
of
it
by
letter
a
few
days
ago
and
i
have
not
had
a
chance
to
find
out
anything
more
about
it.
i
have
not
seen
the
cert
petition
in
that
case.
i'm
not
aware
of
the
underlying...
excuse
me...
the
underlying
order
from
the
michigan
courts
in
that
case.
but
there
may
never
be
a
perfect
case,
but
this
case
is
adverse
and
that
meets
all
the...
all
the
requirements
for
prudential
standing.
article
iii
standing
is
clearly
met
in
this
case,
and
i
hope
this
court
will
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit.
if
this
court
has
no
further
questions.
