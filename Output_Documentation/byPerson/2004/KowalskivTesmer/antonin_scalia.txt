justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
these
lawyers
instead
of...
instead
of
trying
to
sue
on
their
own,
why
didn't
they
just
offer
their
services
to...
to
these
defendants
through
the
state
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
what
i
don't
understand
about...
about
the
fact
that
they
won't...
won't
have
the
right
to
counsel.
it...
it's
at
least
as
easy
for...
for
counsel
to
appear
in
cases
in
which
indigents
need
counsel
as
it
is
for
counsel
to
bring
their
own
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
there...
there's
an
appeal
from...
they
could
request
certiorari
from
the
state
supreme
court
to
this
court,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
have
lawyers
in
those
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
also
bearing
upon
our
prudential
judgment,
i...
i
suppose,
would
be
that
in
order
to
reach
the
merits,
we
have
to
do
what
you
assert
to
be
an
end
run
around
the
younger
abstention.
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
presumably
up
to
this
court,
if
they
want
to
come
that
far.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
what
the
other
side
says
is,
well,
yes,
maybe
they
can
bring
these
suits,
but
in
all
of
those
suits,
they
don't
have
counsel,
what
they...
what
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
same
thing
in
the
bar
case.
the...
the
restriction
against
the
sale
of...
of
liquor
was
a
restriction
imposed
upon
the
person
seeking
to
raise
the
third
party
right.
but
here,
there's
no
restriction
that
applies
to
these
lawyers
who
are
seeking
to
raise
the
third
party
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
so,
but
we've
never
held
what
you
want
us
to
hold
either,
that...
that
when
the
law
does
not
bear
upon
you
personally,
you
have
the
right
to
raise
the
claim
of
a
prospective
client.
we've
never
held
that
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
shouldn't
be
cited
then.
you're
citing
it
for
something
that
the
court
didn't
hold.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
i
thought
you
were
citing
it
here
for
the
quite
different
proposition
that...
that
you
can
raise
third
party
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
at
least
an
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
even
if
they
lose
on
it,
they
still
will
have...
would
have
raised
the
issue
that
you
are
most
concerned
about
getting
raised.
they're
not...
they're
not
so
much
interested
in
the
so
many
dollars
for
this
particular
representation.
even
if
they
lose
on
what
seems
to
me
at
least
a
close
argument,
they
will
have
raised
the
question
you're
trying
to
raise
today.
justice
antonin
scalia
who's
paying
them
for
this
lawsuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
they
have
a
shot
at
getting
paid
using
this
other
method.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
why
would
a
change
in
substantive
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--have
the
same
result?
suppose
there's
a
change
in...
in
the
antitrust
law
and...
and
the
person
says
this
change...
this
change
has
the...
the
effect
of...
of
denying
me
equal
protection
of
the
law.
that's
the
claim
that
the...
that
the
client
would
have.
but
there's
a
lawyer
who
says,
my
goodness,
this
change
will
mean
there
are
many...
many
fewer
antitrust
suits.
i
can
demonstrate
that.
that's
my
specialty,
antitrust
law.
i'm
going
to
lose
a
lot
of
business.
why
wouldn't
he
have
the
right
to
raise
the
equal
protection
claim
of
the
prospective
client?
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
no
facts...
no
additional
facts
would...
would
affect
the
central
point
that...
that
we've
been
devoting
most
of
this
discussion
to,
which
is
whether
there
is
an
impediment
or
not
to...
to
the...
the
actual
individuals
whose
rights
your
clients
are
asserting
raising
their
own
rights.
no
additional
facts
bear
upon
that
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
his
counsel
will
have
raised
them.
and...
and
most,
if
not
all,
of
those
have
to
have
been
raised
by
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
also
have
an
opinion
to
announce
on
behalf
of
the
chief
justice
in
case
no.
03-407,
kowalski
versus
tesmer.
that
case
came
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
michigan
provides
that
an
appeal
by
an
accused
who
has
plead
guilty
is
by
leave
of
court
not
a
matter
of
right.
michigan
state
judges
must
deny
appointed
appellate
counsel
to
indigents
who
plead
guilty
and
do
not
meet
certain
criteria.
two
attorneys
and
three
indigents
challenged
michigan's
procedure
for
appointing
appellate
counsel
in
federal
district
court.
they
alleged
that
the
procedure
violated
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
rights
of
the
indigents.
the
district
court
agreed.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
heard
the
case
en
banc
and
affirmed
in
relevant
part.
it
held
that
the
two
attorneys
had
standing
to
bring
the
suit
although
the
three
indigent
defendants
had
to
be
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
the
so-called
younger
doctrine
which
prevents
federal
court
interference
with
on
going
state
criminal
proceedings.
we
granted
certiorari.
today
in
an
opinion
by
the
chief
justice
we
hold
that
the
two
attorney
respondents
lack
third
party
standing
to
assert
the
rights
of
the
indigents.
accordingly
we
reverse
without
reaching
the
constitutionality
of
the
michigan
procedures.
a
party
generally
must
assert
his
own
rights
and
not
on
those
of
another.
under
the
doctrine
of
third
party
standing
however
we
have
made
an
exception
in
to
this
general
rule.
to
determine
whether
third
party
standing
is
appropriate
we
have
focused
on
two
questions.
we
have
asked
first
whether
the
person
asserting
the
right
has
a
close
relationship
with
the
person
possessing
the
right?
and
second
whether
there
is
a
hindrance
to
the
possessors
ability
to
protect
his
own
right?
here,
the
attorneys
attempt
to
assert
the
right
of
hypothetical
indigent
defendants
who
will
request
in
the
future
but
be
denied
appellate
counsel
under
michigan?s
procedure.
we
do
not
believe
these
attorneys
have
a
close
relationship
with
these
hypothetical
indigents.
indeed
they
do
not
have
no
relationship
at
all.
we
also
do
not
believe
there
is
the
necessary
hindrance
to
the
indigents
asserting
their
own
equal
protection
and
due
process
rights
to
challenge
the
procedure.
the
indigents
have
open
avenues
in
state
and
federal
court
to
assert
their
rights
against
the
michigan
procedure.
and
in
fact
some
indigents
without
the
aid
of
an
attorney
have
advanced
their
claims
to
the
michigan
appellant
courts
and
to
this
court.
this
disproves
the
attorney's
theory
that
without
the
assistance
of
an
attorney
the
indigents
are
unable
to
assert
their
own
rights.
on
a
more
fundamental
level,
if
the
indigents
were
hindered
by
the
lack
of
an
attorney,
that
hindrance
could
have
been
solved
by
the
attorneys
before
us
here
attending
state
court
and
assisting
them
without
charge.
finally,
the
indigents
themselves
appropriately
were
dismissed
as
i
said
earlier
under
the
younger
doctrine.
preventing
federal
court
interference
with
on
going
state
criminal
proceedings,
and
unwillingness
to
allow
our
younger
principle
to
be
the
circumvented
is
in
additional
reason
to
deny
the
attorneys
third
party
standing.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
souter
have
joined.
