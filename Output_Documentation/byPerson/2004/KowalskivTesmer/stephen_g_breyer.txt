justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
while
this
suit
is
being
brought,
we
can't
do
the
simple
thing,
which
is
to
take
a
case
from
an
indigent
who's
raising
it
that
we
happen
to
have
on
our
docket
and
face
it
directly
because
everybody
is
tied
up
in
these
knots
on
standing.
i
mean,
what...
what
is
it
that...
that
you...
led
you
to
bring
this
case
rather
than
just
filing
an
amicus
brief
in
a
case
brought
by
a
real
indigent
who
wants
a
lawyer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see...
i
see
that.
that's
a
good
answer.
and
the...
the
question
i
have
is
if
i
now,
since
we
have
real
indigents,
believe
that
there
absolutely
is
a
way
for
a
real
indigent
to
raise
this
claim
that
isn't
even
hard,
you
could
file
an
amicus
brief.
suppose
i
believed
that,
and
i
do
believe
it
actually.
if
i
believe
it,
then
does
your
third
party
standing
claim
disappear?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
it
doesn't
disappear
and
i
hold
in
your
favor,
would
i
then
be
opening
the
door
to
any
lawyer
whose
pocketbook
is
hurt
by
tort
reform,
by
any
change
at
all,
you
know,
that
means
less
money
for
him,
and
we'd
be
besieged
with
people?
instead
of
the
clients,
we'd
have
all
the
lawyers
in
complaining
that
they
want
to
be
richer.
now,
that's
what's
worrying
me.
so
on
my
assumption,
how
could
i
possibly
decide
in
your
favor
without
opening
that
door?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
question
i'd
like
answered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
assumed
there's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
i'm
sorry.
i...
i...
justice
scalia
and
i
were
assuming
the
same
thing.
if
i
assume
that
there's
no
problem
with
the
real
person,
the
indigent,
raising
the
claim
himself...
and
i'm
saying
on
that
assumption,
which
i
believe,
then
if
i
were
to
decide
in
your
favor,
how
would
i
not
be
opening
the
door
that
i
wanted
to
keep
firmly
closed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
okay.
no.
i
agree
with
you.
if
in
fact
you
think
that
there's
a
problem
about
a
real
indigent
bringing
a
claim
in
michigan,
although
we
have
two
on
the
docket,
if
i
accepted
that
premise,
i
would
begin
to
think
you
were
right.
so
then
what
i
was
trying
to
explore
is
whether
the
whole
thing
comes
down
to
whether
i
accept
that
premise.
and
of
course,
that's
what's
everybody
has
been
talking
about,
and
i
do
see
at
the
moment
a
couple
of
very
good
ways
that
indigents
can
bring
it
themselves,
and
indeed
they
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
everything
comes
down
to
that.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
i'm
just...
the
reason
i
think
it's
so
easy
is
because
we
get
indigents.
we
get
thousands
of
them.
and
all
you
have
to
have
is
some
indigent
saying,
hey,
i
want
a
lawyer.
okay?
that's
all.
he
has
to
be
able
to
write
those
words.
and
at
that
point,
you
and
the
others
come
in
with
amicus
briefs,
if
necessary,
and
support
him.
