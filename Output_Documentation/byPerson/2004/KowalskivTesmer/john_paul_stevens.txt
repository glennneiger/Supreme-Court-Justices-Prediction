justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
in
exercising
prudential
judgment
on
whether
to
accord
prudential
standing,
because
i
guess
there's
article
iii
standing
here,
is
it
appropriate
to
take
into
consideration
as
one
fact
that
it's
already
been
argued
in
this
case
and
it's
now
ripe
for
decision,
or
should
we
just
totally
ignore
that
aspect
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
in
that
case
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
interests
of
the
third
party
and
the
interests
of
the
litigant
or
a
potential
client.
here
there's
no
conflict
between
the
lawyers
and
the
clients.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
why
isn't
the
younger
abstention
problem
just
like
the
mootness
problem
in
craig
against
boren?
it
took
one
class
of
litigants
unavailable
but
then
allowed
the
third
party
to
have
standing.
why...
why
aren't...
aren't
your
opponents
here
just
like
the
bartenders
in
craig
against
boren?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they
have
the
same
interest
that
the
bartenders
had
because
they
won't
make
some...
sell
their
services
and
the
bartenders
wouldn't
sell
the
booze.
i
don't
see
the
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
correct
as
a
factual
matter
that
these
particular
lawyers
do
have
clients
that
they
could
be
representing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
direct
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
just
would
seem
to
me
that
the
lawyers
who
are
advancing
this
claim
may
or
may
not
be
representing
individuals
who
want
to
make
the
same
claim,
but
there...
there
must
be
some
lawyers
who
want
to
make
these
claims
who
don't
have
any
clients,
and
the
question
is
whether
they
have
standing.
and
are
they
to
be
defeated
standing
because
there
are
a
lot
of
other
lawyers
who
might
also
sue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what
case
holds
that
there
must
be
an
impediment
for
the
third
party?
i
keep
coming
back
to
craig
against
boren.
they
could
have
filed
another
class
action
and
say
that
they
filed
a
class
action
and
had
standing.
would
we
have
suddenly
decided
we
won't
decide
the
merits
even
though
it's
been
argued
and
both
sides
have
had
their
day
in
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
source
of
the
requirement
there
must
be
an
impediment
to
the
third
party
suit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that...
where
they
granted
standing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
they
ever
denied
standing
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
impediment
to
the
third
party
suit?
i
don't
think
we
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
have
to
be
idle
to
be
dicta,
though,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
fully
concede
there
must
be
an
impediment
even
though
the
court
has
never
so
held?
