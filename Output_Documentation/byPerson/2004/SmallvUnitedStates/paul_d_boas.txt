mr.
paul
d.
boas
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
whether,
when
deciding
the
meaning
of
a
statute,
we
will
focus,
as
the
government
suggests,
on
two
words
only,
any
court,
or
whether
we
will
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole,
whether
we
will
consider
the
statute
as
a
symmetrical
and
coherent
regulatory
scheme
and
decide
the
meaning
of
the
statute
by
appreciating
how
sections
relate
to
one
another.
in
this
particular
case,
922(g)(1)
of
18
u.s.
code
is
a...
represents
a
merger
of
two
old
sections,
title
iv
and
title
vii,
that
were
passed
in
1968
in
the
omnibus
crime
control
act.
in...
in
those...
in
that
statute,
we
had
two
redundant
and
overlapping
sections,
and
one
talked
about
prohibiting
persons
who
have
been
convicted
in
any
court
of
a
crime
punishable
by
more
than
a
year.
one,
title
vii,
talked
about
prohibiting
persons
convicted
in
any
court
of
the
united
states
or
a
state
of
a
felony.
there
were
different
penalties,
slightly
different
classes
of
people.
title
iv
focused
more
on
the
receiver;
title
vii
more
on
the
possessor.
but
nothing...
nothing
about
the...
these
two
titles,
about
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
congress
at
any
time
meant
something
different
from
the
term,
any
court,
in
title
iv
and
any
court
of
the
united
states
in
title
vii.
and
when
these
two
were
merged
in
1986
in
the
firearms
owners'
protection
act,
again,
nothing
suggests,
nothing
in
the
comments,
nothing
in
the
statute,
that
these
two
terms...
that
the
elimination
of
the
language,
any
court
of
the
united
states,
was--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--that's...
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
however--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--well,
earlier
this
year
in
the
nixon
case,
this
court
said
that
when
we
look
at
any...
and
that
was
a
case
dealing
with
the
meaning
of
any
entity.
did
it
mean
any
entity,
public
or
private,
or
any
private
entity?
the
court
said
any
can
and
does
mean
different
things
depending
upon
the
setting,
and
the
court
said
when
using
it
broadly
would
lead
to
strange
and
indeterminate
results,
we'll
give
it
a
more
narrow
reading,
which
the
court
did.
now,
you're
right,
justice
o'connor.
this
court
has
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
felon
in
possession
statute
was
to
be
broad
and
sweeping,
but
the
government
reiterates
that
view,
citing
repeatedly
three
cases,
scarborough,
bass,
and
lewis,
and
all
three
of
those
cases
in
which
the
court
referred
to
congress'
comments
and
this
court's
own
comments
about
the
broad
sweep
of
the
statute
were
1202(a)
cases.
and
so
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
court
said
this
is
a
broad
statute,
each
one
of
those
cases,
lewis,
bass,
and
scarborough,
were
cases
where
by
definition
the
prohibition
was
against
persons
convicted
in
any
court
of
the
united
states
or
a
state.
so
that
language
doesn't
help
the
government
at
all
because
those
were
1202(a)
cases
which
limited
specifically
the
court
to
any
court
of
the
united
states.
so
to
take
the...
and
i...
and...
the
simplistic
view
that
as
the...
as
the
fourth
and
sixth
circuit
did
and
as
the
government
does
here,
that
any
means
any,
without
regard
to
the
rest
of
the
statute,
is
simply...
is...
is
too
narrow
a
focus.
let's
look
at
the
statute.
it's
true
that
the
word...
the
term,
the
two
words,
any
court,
is
not
defined.
but
if
we
look
in
the
definitions
section,
the
term,
crime
punishable
by
more
than
a
year,
is
defined.
and
so
what
we
should
really
be
focusing
on
is
the
phrase,
convicted
in
any
court
of
a
crime
punishable
by
more
than
a
year.
and
that
definition
says
the
term,
crime
punishable
by
more
than
a
year,
excludes
any
state
or
federal
antitrust
or
business
regulatory
offense.
now,
if
we
exclude
from
the
definition
of
crime
punishable
by
more
than
a
year
and
the
government's...
if
we
exclude
from
that
any
state
or
federal
antitrust
law
and
the
government's
interpretation
is
adopted,
then
we're
left
with
the
anomalous
result
that
if
a
person
is
convicted
of
an
antitrust
offense
in
this
country,
they're
allowed
to
possess
a
firearm.
if
they're
convicted
of
one
in
france
or
england,
they
can't.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
no.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
nor
have
i--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--well,
921(20)
or--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--well,
the...
the
limitation
not
only
excludes
antitrust
offenses,
it
excludes
any
business
regulatory
offense.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
of
course.
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--yes.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
i...
i'm
certainly
that
there
are
business
regulatory
crimes
throughout
the
world.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
well--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--well,
this
same
limitation,
justice
scalia,
existed
as
a
limitation
under
1202(a)
where
any
court
said
any
state
or
federal
court
and
the
exclusion
said
any
state
or
federal
court.
it's
consistent--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--well,
but
at
some
point
in
the
statute,
congress
has
to
give
an
indication
of
their
intent,
and
this
is
where
it
is.
for
example,
there's
another
limitation
immediately
following
it
which
says
it
shall
also
not
include
any
state
offense
which
is
described
as
a
misdemeanor
in
the
state
and
carries
no
more
than
2
years.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
well,
there
has
to
be
some
indication--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--well,
if
we
go
further
with
921(20),
there's
another
limitation
that
again
clearly
deals
with
states,
and
that's
the
restoration
of
civil
rights
provision.
the
government
concedes
in
their
brief...
and
that
was
an
effort
to
essentially
statutorily
reverse
the
dickerson
v.
banner
institute
case...
that
that
applies
to
state
situations.
the
idea
that
if
a
person
receives
a
state
pardon
or
his
record
is
expunged,
that
wouldn't
be
a
disqualifying
factor.
and
they
talk
about
the
law
of
the
foreign
state
being
what
determines
whether
it's
a
conviction
or
not.
now,
clearly
we're
not
looking
at
going
to
some
pardon
process
in
germany
or
uruguay
to
decide
whether
a
person
still
has
a
conviction.
another
part
of
the
statute
that's
very
clear,
924(e)(1).
that's
the
armed
career
criminal
section.
that
section
says
that
if
a
person's
who's
convicted
under
922(g)(1),
our
statute,
and
has
three
prior
serious
drug
convictions
in
a
court
described
in
922(g)(1),
then
they
get
15
years.
now,
that
definition
of
serious
drug
conviction
is
a
state
or
federal
conviction.
now,
let's
flip
over
to
21
u.s.c.
802(44),
the
drug
statute
where
you
have
a
similar
recidivist
type
of
statute
where
you
go
from
a
5-year
mandatory
to
a
10-year
mandatory
if
you
have
a
prior
drug
conviction.
there
in
802(44),
a
serious
drug
offense
is
defined
as
a
state,
federal,
or
foreign
drug
offense.
so
we
see
that
congress
can
differentiate
when
it
wants
to.
now,
they're--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--well,
perhaps
they
should
be
more
consistent,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
overall...
i
mean,
if
you
go
down
the
list
of
the
prohibitions
in
922(g)(1),
you
can
see
that
the
thrust
of
this
is...
is
to
deal
with
domestic
situations.
there's
one
that
says
you
can't
own
a
firearm
if
you're
a...
a
fugitive
from
law...
a
fugitive
from
justice.
that's
specifically
defined
as
a
fugitive
from
another
state
within
the
united
states.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
i
think
they
would
have.
i
think
that...
i
don't
concede
that
there
was
really
a
need
to,
but
i
think
they
would
have
because
they
would
have
said
it's--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--that's
right.
but
they
would
have
historically
going
back
to
'68
and
before,
we
always
intended
this
to
just
cover
domestic
situations.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
if
the
individual
is
convicted
in
japan,
justice
stevens,
then
he
would
not
be
under
our
immigration
laws
allowed
to
come
to
this
country,
and
if
he
did
come--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--he'd
be
an
illegal
alien.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
well,
because
he's
an
american
citizen.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
so...
but
congress
can't
cure
every
problem
that
exists
in
the
world,
and
this
statute
is
fairly
comprehensive.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
any
crime
that
carries
more
than
a
year
basically.
it's
pretty--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--well,
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--no.
well,
those
people
will
probably
be
seeking
political
asylum.
aleksandr
solzhenitsyn...
under
the
government's
interpretation,
nobel
prize
winners
would
be
precluded
from...
solzhenitsyn
did
8
years
in
a
soviet
prison
because
he
said
nasty
things
about
joseph
stalin.
two
american
women
in
afghanistan,
before
the
fall
of
the
taliban
regime,
were
arrested
and
convicted
because
they
possessed
bibles.
now,
the
government
says,
well,
these
are
anomalies.
these
don't
occur
often.
but
congress
had
to
be
aware
of
the
possibility
of
tinhorn
dictatorships
all
over
the
world
having
court
systems
that
were
so
devoid
of
due
process
that
we
have
to
take
a
look
at
whether
we
want
to--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--that's
what
they
said,
but...
but
when
and
how
do
we
decide
that?
there's
another
offense
under
922(g)(1)...
or
under
922
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
give
a
false
answer
on
a...
a
firearms
questionnaire
when
you
go
to
buy
the
gun...
buy
the
gun.
now,
what
does
not
individual
do?
does
he
say
to
the
firearms
dealer,
do
you
have
a
list
of
countries
where
our
government
has
decided
it's
a
fair
enough
system
that
i
can
say
no...
yes,
i
have
a
conviction
in
view
of
the
list
that
it's
an
unfair
system
so
i
can
say
yes,
i
have
no...
or
no,
i
have
no
convictions?
i
mean,
it...
one
of
the
reasons
where
we
employ,
for
example,
the
rule
of
lenity,
is...
is
a
person
put
on
notice
of
what
it
is
that's
criminal
and
what
is
not.
when
does
it
come
up
that
the
system
isn't
fair
enough
to
count?
mr.
paul
d.
boas
well,
what
i'd
prefer
and
that
the
statute
means
aren't
necessarily
the
same
thing,
your
honor.
i'd
prefer
violent
criminals
who
were
dangerous
not
to
have
guns.
but
again,
that--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--i
think
congress
would
say
the
perils
and
problems
that
exist
by
a
blanket
inclusion
without
any
method
of
determining
which
count
and
which
don't
count
of
foreign
convictions
are
too
great.
now--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--well,
but
what
if
it's
a
foreign
conviction
where
there's
no
due
process?
is
there
a
checklist
that
in
that
foreign
conviction,
did
you
have
a
jury,
did
you
have
the
right
to
confront
your
accuser,
did
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent?
i
mean,
we
all
seem
to
realize
that
the
government's
position
that
any
conviction
anywhere
is
too
stark
a
place.
and
again--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--that's
right.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
that's
one
of
the
subsections
of
922(g)(5).
anybody
who's
an
illegal
alien
here
illegally
can't
have
a
gun.
anyone--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--no.
it
doesn't
cover--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--that...
i
didn't
hear
your--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--well,
i
don't
think
congress
can
be
said
to
have
intended
or
envisioned
that
they
would
cure
every
problem
in
the
world.
it's
a
very,
very
narrow
category
of
american
citizens
convicted
abroad
who
come
back
here.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
well,
your
honor,
it's
unclear
what...
what
their
thought
process
was
in
this
matter.
but
i
can
say
this,
that
the
narrow
category
that
escapes
the
coverage
of
this
statute...
there's
nothing
to
indicate
anywhere
in
any
of
the
debates,
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
that's
what
congress
intended.
and
again,
if
you
look
at
the
overall
view
here,
i
mean,
fugitive
from
justice.
it's
limited
to
someone
from
the
state.
person...
let's
look
at
922(g)(9).
very
clear,
incapable
of
misunderstanding.
the
same
prefatory
language.
a
person
convicted
in
any
court...
exactly
the
same,
and
it
ends
with
the
same
language...
cannot
ship,
possess,
receive.
and
what
does
it
say?
instead
of
saying
convicted
of
a
crime
punishable
by
more
than
a
year,
it
says
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence.
and
that's
defined
as
a
state
or
federal
misdemeanor.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
that's
defined
in
921(a)(33),
your
honor.
it's
specifically
limited.
now,
here
we
are.
a
person
who
beats
his
wife
in
england
can
have
a
gun
in
this
country,
but
a
person
who
commits
a
business
regulatory
offense
in
germany
can't.
it
makes
no
sense.
the...
it...
it's
a
very
clear
statement
by
congress
that
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence...
they're
only
intending
it
to
be
a
state
or
federal
crime.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
at...
at
some
point
a
person
has
to
be
told
what
congress
was
intending.
this
language
goes
back
to
'68
where
the
language
in
the
exclusion
limiting
it
to
state...
excluding
federal
and
state
convictions
matched
the
language
in
the
term,
any
court,
in
1202(a),
which
was
title
vii.
they
were...
they
were
complementing
each
other.
and...
and
if
you
look
at
even
as
far
back
as
the
batchelder
decision
in
the
'70's
from
this
court,
the
court
talked
about
these
two
being
redundant,
overlapping,
the
only
difference
being
that
one
uses
the
term
felony,
one
uses
the
term
crime
punishable
by
more
than
a
year.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
yes.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
the...
they
made
no
discussion
of
the
reason
for
taking
out
the
language,
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
state,
and
what
they...
the
only
language
was
that
we're
intending
to
merge
these
into
one
statute--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--yes.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
exactly.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
and...
and
by
keeping
in
the
exclusions,
by...
by
looking
at
924(e)(1)
where
it...
what's
very
important
to
me
is
that
924(e)(1)
says
if
you
have
three
prior
drug...
serious
drug
offenses
in
a
court
referred
to
in
922(g)(1),
you
get
15
years.
those
three
prior
three
drug
offenses
in
a
court
referred
to
in
922(g)(1)
are
state
or
federal
drug
offenses
by
definition.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
really
couldn't
be
any
more
clear.
and
frankly,
to
the
extent
it's
not
totally
clear
and
it
could
go
either
way,
i
think
then
the
rule
of
lenity
requires
that
it
be
decided
with
a
more
narrow
construction,
that
is,
that
any
court
meant
any
court
of
the
state
or
of
the
united
states.
i
believe
it
was
in
the...
in
the
'90's
when
this
court's
opinion,
authored
by
justice
thomas
in
i
think
it
was
called
alvarez-sanchez,
dealt
with
a
statute,
3105
dealing
with
the
admissibility
of
confessions
in
federal
cases
and
that
they
won't
be
inadmissible
if
they're
taken
by
any
law
enforcement
official
more
than
6
hours
after
the
arrest.
and
the
issue
what
does
any
mean
in
terms
of
any
law
enforcement
official.
and
the
court
said
it
means
any
state
or
federal
law
enforcement
official.
now,
it
didn't
have
to
reach
the
issue
of
whether
it
included
foreign
law
enforcement
officials,
but
certain
things
are
obvious
without
an...
an
explanation.
and
you're
right.
there
was
some
sloppy
drafting
here
and
it
could
have
been
more
clear,
but
when
we
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
try
to
harmonize
the
various
parts
of
that
statute,
it
would
be
almost
absurd
to
think,
when
we
look...
and...
and
maybe
these
anomalies
won't
occur
all
the
time,
as
you
point
out,
justice
breyer,
but
it
would
almost
be
absurd
to
think
that
with
all
of
these
limitations,
exclusions,
when
we
run
down
the
list
under
922(g)(1),
that
congress
was
talking
about
any
court
in
the
world.
now--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--i'd
say...
that's...
there's
a
question--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--it's
a
good
question.
[laughter]
i'd
say
the
nixon
case
decided
this
year
which
said
that
any
can
and
does
mean
different
things
depending
upon
the
setting
and
whether
it
works
strange
and
indeterminate
results
would
be
one
of
my
best
cases.
there's...
when
i
sit
down,
i'll
probably
think
of
a
better
one,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--well--
[laughter]
mr.
paul
d.
boas
well,
i...
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case.
mr.
paul
d.
boas
that's
should
be...
that's
a
good
one
too,
judge...
justice.
i...
i...
there's...
there's
another
case
that
i'd
refer
to
which
is
the...
the
gonzales
case,
which
is
cited
by
the
government.
gonzales
is
interesting
because
it
deals
with
924(c)(1),
which
is
the
section
that
says
you
get
5
consecutive
years
if
you're
convicted
of...
5
years
consecutive
to
any
other
sentence
if
you're
convicted
of
possessing
a
firearm
during
the
course
of
a
serious
drug
offense.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
concluded
that
any
other
sentence
meant
any
state
or
federal
sentence,
not
just
a
federal
sentence.
now,
the
government
might
argue
that
that
helps
them
because
the...
the
defendant
in
that
case
wanted
it
to
be
limited
to
any
federal
sentence
because
he
was
serving
a
state
sentence,
and
the
question
was
would
the
5
years
for
the
924
violation
be
consecutive
or
concurrent,
as
the
trial
court
gave
it.
but
it...
what
the
court
did
was
say
any
depends
on
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
statute.
and
here,
we
think
it
means
state
and
federal.
they
didn't
talk
about
foreign
convictions.
you
know,
it's
interesting.
it's
ironic
that...
that
while
we're
debating
how
american
citizens
should
be
impacted
by
foreign
convictions,
the
administration
is
unwilling
to
sign
the
treaty
that
would
make
american
citizens
subject
to
the
international
criminal
court
because
there's
concern
about
what
would
happen
to
americans
abroad,
even
in
that
court,
not
in
a
court
in...
in
uruguay
or
in
north
korea,
but
in
the
international
criminal
court.
in
fact,
in
the
preliminary
findings
of
the
fopa
statute,
the...
the
congress
said...
and
this
court
doesn't
have
to
decide
and
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
decide
the
second
amendment
issue,
but
congress
found
the
second
amendment
was
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
and
the
name
of
the
statute
is
the
firearms
owners'
protection
act.
congress
had
in
mind
protecting
the
owners
of
firearms
when
necessary,
and--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--that's
right.
the
spelling
is
a
little
bit
different,
justice
scalia.
but
congress...
the...
the
name
of
the
statute
tells
you
something
about
congress'
intent.
the
otherwise
licit
and
blameless
activity
of
possessing
a
firearm
isn't
the
equivalent
of
selling
drugs.
now,
maybe
if
you
have
a
prior
drug
offense
and
you're
a
drug
dealer,
under
802
of
21,
congress
said
you
get
your
sentence
doubled
whether
it's
a
state,
federal,
or
foreign
conviction,
but
under
924(e)
for
a
conviction
under
a
court
defined
in
922(g)(1),
the
prior
only
ups
your
sentence
if
it's
a
state
or
federal
conviction.
we
can't
ignore
the
overall
statutory
scheme
here,
which
time
and
time
again
refers
to
domestic
matters.
the
government
in
their
brief
says
foreign
convictions
are
used
all
the
time,
and
they
give
three
examples.
they
say
we
recognize
them
for
the
purpose
of
extraditing
american
citizens.
they
say
we
recognize
them
because
if
you're
convicted
of
a...
a
sex
offense
in
certain
foreign
countries,
you
have
to
register
here.
and
they
say
we
recognize
them...
i
forget
what
their
third
reason
is.
but
there's
no
example
that
they
gave
or
that
they
can
give
where
a
foreign
conviction
is
ever
used
anywhere
else
in
this
country
as
an
element
of
the
crime.
i
mean,
it's
used
for
recidivist
purposes
and
state
courts
have
debated
back
and
forth
whether
we're
going
to
double
somebody's
sentence
because
of
a
foreign
conviction,
but
it's
never
used
anywhere
else
as
an
element
of
the
crime.
this...
this
would
be
a
first,
and
it's
pretty
significant.
to
me
it's
ironic
that
the
sentencing
commission
said
you
can't
use
a
foreign
conviction
simply
to
up
somebody
a
few
months
in
the
guidelines.
but
the
government
here
argues
that
we
can
use
it
to
satisfy
an
element
of
the
crime--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--well,
that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
the...
it's
an
exception
under
apprendi
that
the...
the
prior
crime.
but
what...
what
i'm
saying
is
it's...
it's
a
slightly
different
situation
in
terms
of
it
being...
i
know
we
have
blakely
and
the
whole
sentencing
factor
issue.
but
it...
it's
a
slightly
different
use
of
a
prior
and
making...
in
other...
in
all
those
cases,
the...
it's
a
crime
whether
or
not
you
have
a
felony.
the
felony
might
make
it
a
more
serious
crime.
in
our
case,
this
isn't
a
crime
without
this
felony.
that's
the
thing
that
makes
it
a
crime.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
the
only
situation
we
have
where
something
that's
otherwise
blameless
conduct
becomes
a
crime
is
the
use
of
a
felony.
there's
no
other
situation
where
a
foreign
felony
is
employed
or
has
been
employed
in
that
situation.
if
there's
no
other
questions,
i'd
like
to,
if
it
would
please
the
court,
reserve
the--
mr.
paul
d.
boas
--i
have.
well,
thank
you.
