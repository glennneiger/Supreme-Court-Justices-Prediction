justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
there
any
such
cases?
i
mean,
i
never
heard
actually--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--when
people...
no.
i
mean,
are
there
any
cases
in
which
france
or
england
has
convicted
people
of
an
antitrust
violation
punishable
by
imprisonment
for
more
than
a
year?
i...
i
didn't
know
that
their
antitrust
laws
had
a
criminal
aspect,
though
i
haven't
looked
it
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
well,
i...
i've
never
heard
if
anyone
in
any
foreign
country,
other
than
ours,
though
i
gather
my
law
clerk
found
that
in
japan,
in
fact,
japan
does
have
a
criminal
antitrust
law.
they
may
be
the
only
ones
outside
the
united
states,
and
i
don't
know
that
anyone
has
ever
been
convicted
under
it
because
they're
not
too...
or
they
didn't
used
to
be
too
fierce
on
antitrust
enforcement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
wondering
how
anomalous
or
your
anomaly
is.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
are
there
such?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
maybe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't...
i
don't...
but
i
just...
are
we
sure
that
there...
that,
you
know,
that
this
anomaly
exists?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
people
really
not
allowed
to
come
in
if
they've
been
convicted
of
any
crime?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
it
was
a
crime
like
not
wearing
a
veil
if
you're
a
woman
in
a
country
that...
suppose
it
was
a
crime
like
criticizing
the
government
if
you
were
in
soviet
russia.
suppose
it
was
a
crime
like...
you
know,
there
are
all
kinds
of
crimes
that
we...
we
would
never
consider
crimes--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
in
other
countries
there
are...
we
don't
let
anyone
in
if
they've
done
any
of
those
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
put
the
question
to
congress,
which
would
you
prefer?
would
you
prefer
the
occasional
person
who's
been
convicted
of
foreign
court,
comes
over
here,
that
this
statute
doesn't
apply
to
him,
or
would
you
prefer
that
all
the
refugees
from
eastern
europe
and
people
who
come
from
arab
countries
and
people
who
come
from
countries
that
have
quite
different
systems
in
places
all
over
the
world
discover
that
suddenly
they're
felons
because
of
things
they
never
would
have
dreamt
of
because
they
were
perhaps
convicted
of
selling
gasoline
on
the
open
market
or
perhaps
they
were
convicted
of
any
of
these
religious
crimes
we've
talked
about,
selling
a
bible?
suppose
you
put
that
question
to
congress.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
many
times
have
you
used
this
statute
to
go
after
people
who
were
convicted
in
a
foreign
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
about,
approximate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
more
like
100,
more
like
50,
more
like
10,
more
like
5?
about
how
many?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
10
to
a
dozen
over
how
long
a
period
of
time?
20
years,
18
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
'68.
now...
so
35-40
years.
now...
now,
how
many
times
do
you
think
that
people...
i
mean,
the...
the...
if
you've
used
it
only
a
dozen
times
or
so
in
about
40
years,
then
it
doesn't
sound
like
a
major
threat.
what
i'm
weighing
against
that
is
the
possibility
that
people
are
really
convicted
abroad
of
selling
bibles.
that
really
does
happen,
and
there
really
were
economic
crimes
in
1968
in
all
the
eastern
european
countries,
and
these
aren't
fanciful
examples
i've
been
giving
you.
and
so
if
you
were
in
congress...
or...
or
why
do
you
think
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
get
the
courts
into
the
mess
of
trying
to
decide
why
wouldn't
those
crimes
be
covered
and
were
the
procedures
fair?
and
we
start
distinguishing
one
country
from
another.
and
what
are
the
procedures
in
the
ukraine
or
kazakhstan
anyway?
i
mean,
my
goodness,
what
a
mess
for
the
sake
of
a
dozen
cases
in
40
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
didn't
really
have
a
chance--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
i...
i
want
to
get
you.
now,
i
have
a
new
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
have
a
new--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i...
can
i...
that's
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
know.
when
a
person
comes
in
to
get
a
gun...
because
i
hadn't
focused
on
this,
and
it
actually
to
me
it's
relevant.
suppose
one
of
these
people
has
been
convicted
in
a
foreign
court
and
he
doesn't
have
a
clue,
you
know,
that
this
means
he
can't
buy
a
gun
over
here.
so
he
comes
over
here.
he
goes
into
a...
a
gun
store.
now,
does
he
get
notice
that
that...
this
conviction
over
in
japan
or
lithuania
or
wherever
it
was
means
that
he
can't
buy
the
gun?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
asking...
i'm
asking
in
general.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
just
says
any
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it'll
work
for...
yes.
it'll...
it'll
work
for
this
one,
but...
but
what
i'm
worried
about...
and
really
what
led
the
sentencing
commission
to
exclude
all
this
stuff
even
though
clearly
recidivists
should
get
a
higher
sentence,
but
we
still
excluded
it
because
it's
just
a
nightmare.
there
are
notice
problems.
there
are
fairness
problems.
there
are
procedural
problems.
there
are
problems
of
crimes
that
aren't
crimes
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
all
those
come
up,
and
that's
what
i'm
worried
about.
so
i
see
this
as
a
possible
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
one...
the
procedure
you
just
talked
about
might
help.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
he
knows
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
is
about
a
federal
firearm
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
for
a
person
to
possess
a
gun
if
that
person
has
been
convicted
in
any
court,
those
are
they
keywords,
"in
any
court,
of
a
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
for
more
than
a
year.
the
legal
question
before
us
concerns
the
scope
of
the
words
convicted
in
any
court.
do
those
words
cover
convictions
in
foreign
courts?
the
petitioner
here
for
example,
gary
small,
was
previously
convicted
of
gun
smuggling
into
japan
by
a
japanese
court.
does
the
statute
forbid
him
subsequently
to
possess
a
gun
as
it
would
if
for
example
he
would
previously
been
convicted
of
gun
smuggling
by
a
court
in
maine?
we
answered
the
question
no.
we
think
the
words
any
court
do
not
include
foreign
courts.
for
one
thing,
the
statutory
word
"any",
though
it
is
certainly
a
broad
word,
does
not
answer
the
question
by
itself.
if
i
say
i
will
go
to
a
film
playing
at
any
theater
this
evening,
i
am
not
talking
about
theaters
in
japan.
we
have
to
look
to
context
to
find
out
the
answer.
or
another
thing,
when
reading
ambiguous
statutes,
we
often
start
with
the
common
sense
notion
that
congress
legislates
with
domestic
concerns
in
mind.
that
notion
cannot
decide
this
case
for
the
gun
possession
here
is
domestic.
small
was
prosecuted
for
possessing
a
gun
in
the
united
states
but
it
does
argue
in
favor
of
the
view
that
congress
thought
that
the
preceding
triggering
crime
would
be
domestic
as
well,
and
that
view
is
further
supported
by
the
fact
that
foreign
countries
may
have
criminal
laws
that
are
very
different
from
our
own
substantively
different
think
of
economic
crimes
in
the
former
soviet
union
procedurally
different.
think
of
systems
that
downgrade
the
significance
of
testimony
if
it
is
given
by
a
woman
or
different
in
punishments.
think
of
systems
that
punish
severely
conduct
that
we
would
treat
as
simply
minor.
to
import
all
such
convictions
into
this
statute
would
leave
judges
with
a
difficult
case
by
case
task
of
distinguishing
among
different
foreign
laws
and
leave
some
americans,
say
recent
immigrants
from
some
of
those
countries,
uncertain
as
to
whether
they
could
or
could
not
buy
guns.
we
consequently
begin
with
a
domestic
only
assumption,
but
we
use
this
assumption
simply
as
a
kind
of
tiebreaker
if
congressional
intent
in
the
matter
is
difficult
to
discern.
finally,
we
have
gone
through
all
the
other
indications
and
we
cannot
get
one
place
to
the
other.
we
do
not
find
anything
that
tells
us
what
congress
really
intended.
the
language
of
the
statute
says
nothing.
indeed,
if
we
were
to
apply
that
statute
to
foreign
convictions,
it
would
produce,
because
of
the
language,
a
number
of
anomalies
that
otherwise
would
be
absent.
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
tells
us
nothing.
it
is
silent
on
the
matter.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
keeping
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
persons
does
tell
us
a
little.
indeed,
it
argues
against
our
conclusion
but
it
tells
us
too
little.
that
is
because
the
government
says
that
in
the
nearly
40
years
this
statute
has
been
on
the
books,
there
have
been
no
more
than
10
to
a
dozen
cases
involving
convictions
entered
in
foreign
courts.
so,
applying
the
statute
to
domestic
only
convictions
cannot
make
much
practical
difference.
we
conclude,
using
our
tiebreaker,
that
in
all
likelihood,
congress
simply
did
not
think
about
the
matter.
so,
with
the
tiebreaker,
we
decide
against
foreign
application
of
the
phrase
"any
court",
though
congress
of
course
remains
free
to
amend
the
statute.
for
these
and
other
reasons
discussed
in
the
opinion,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
and
we
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
join.
the
chief
justice
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
