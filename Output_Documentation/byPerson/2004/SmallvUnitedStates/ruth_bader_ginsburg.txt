justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would...
would
you
concede
that...
that
this
is
at
least
sloppy
drafting?
because
they
said
any
in
one
place,
they
said
state
or
federal
in
other
places.
shouldn't
they
be...
be
consistent
in
their
terminology?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the...
the
court
of
appeals
here
said
what
it
would...
it
read
in
a
check.
it
said
it
wouldn't
read
it
to
really
mean
any
conviction.
it
had
to
be
in
a
system
that
was
fundamentally
fair.
wasn't
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
said?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may...
may
we
go
back
to
the...
the
choice
that
you
were
given
by
justice
scalia
first
and
then
justice
breyer?
i
thought
that
someone
who
comes
in
here
illegally
and
possesses
a
gun
commits
an
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
so?
so
there's
not...
congress
would
say
to
that
hypothetical,
we've
got
a
third
choice,
much
more
sensible.
anybody
who
sneaks
in
here
without
permission
and
has
a
gun--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--commits
a
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
boas,
when
they
combined
these
two--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
ones...
the
1202
did
say
federal
or
state...
they
made
other
changes,
harmonizations.
in
the
explanation
of
their
consolidation
of
the
two
sections,
to
what
extent
did
they
discuss
changes
and
the
reasons
for
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
did...
they
did
explain
other
things--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--other
changes,
but
this
one...
there's
silence--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
far
as
i
understand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how...
how
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
this
is
one
i'm...
i'm
surprised
that
you
didn't
cite,
but
it...
i
don't
think
you
did...
eeoc
against
arabian
american
oil
company,
where
the
wording
of
the
statute
was
anyplace
outside
the
united
states,
title
vii
coverage,
and
this
court
held
that
anyplace
outside
the
united
states
did
not
mean
that
a
u.s.
employer
operating
abroad
had
to
abide
by
the
anti-discrimination
norms
with
respect
to
hiring
in
some
place
abroad
because
congress
was
thinking
in
terms
of
the
inter-state
sitting...
in
the
setting
and
not
international.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that...
that
was
a
decision
by
the
chief.
so--
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is...
there's
an
overarching
concern
and
i'll...
i'd
like
to
put
it
to
you
right
from
the
beginning.
when
a
legislature
legislates,
be
it
the
state
or
federal
government,
it
is
generally
thinking
in
terms
of
its
own
domain,
its
own
bailiwick.
when
congress
legislates,
it's
thinking
about
the
united
states.
sometimes
it's
thinking
about
abroad,
but
most
of
the
time
when
it
is,
it
says
so.
and
we
have
a
number
of
cases,
not
just
the
arabian
american
oil
company.
i
mean,
that...
the
language
of
title
vii
was
between
a
state
and
anyplace
outside
thereof,
anyplace
outside
thereof.
and
in
that
very
case,
the
chief
made
the
point
that
i'm
putting
to
you
now,
that
congress
thinks
about
the
united
states,
our
country,
and
if
it
means
to
say
something
that
will
take
in
other
places
in
the
world,
it
says
so
clearly.
and
we
don't
make
the
assumption
that
congress
was
intending
to
have
any
extraterritorial
flip
to
its
law
unless
it
tells
us
that.
that's
my
overall
concern
about
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
was
it?
just...
what
was
the
case
you
just
mentioned?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that...
that
example,
what
you
gave
in
your
brief,
gave
me
this
concern.
the
problem
that
you've
just
been
describing,
the
state
convictions
that
may
be
invalid
but
is
being
used
under
922,
i
regard
that
as
a
kind
of
a
venue
question
because
you
can
go
back
to
the
state
that
rendered
the
conviction
and
say,
state,
i
was
convicted
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
give
me
my
good
habeas
writ
that
i
get...
can
get
from
the
state.
then
i
wipe
out
that
conviction
and
i
don't
have
it
anymore.
but
the
person
who's
been
convicted,
say,
in
whatever
examples...
take...
zimbabwe
would
be
another
example.
libya.
to
go
back
to
that
system
and
get
a
conviction
expunged.
that's
why
you
can't
use
a
case
within
the
u.s.
system
where
it's
a
question
of
where
do
you
go
to
wipe
out
your
prior
conviction.
and
for
someone
abroad,
there
isn't
that
option.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's...
that's
a
question
of
waiver
or
forfeiture.
those
are
the
ordinary
rules
that
apply.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
there's
a
basic
rule
in
civil
as
well
as
criminal
procedure,
that
if
you
want
to
attack
a
judgment,
you
go
where
that
judgment
was
rendered.
and
of
course,
you
should
abide
by
the
timing
rules
of
that,
but
that's
just
a
very
sensible
thing
within
a
federal
union.
if
you're...
if
you're
attacking
what
state
a
does,
go
to
state
a,
don't
tell
state
c.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that...
that
doesn't
operate
internationally.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you're
not
building
that
into
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
at
all
because
you
have
said
in
your
brief...
and
correct
me
if
i've
got
you
wrong...
you
don't
like
what
the
third
circuit
did.
you
say
just
the
fact
of
the
conviction
counts.
don't
investigate,
court,
whether
it
was
a
fair
system
that
comports
with
fundamental
notions
of
due
process.
just
see
if
there's
a
conviction
anyplace
in
the
world.
and
so
what...
what
you're
telling
me
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
that
you
didn't
appeal
because
even
if
he
were
precluded
from
appealing
for
some
reason
that
we
would
consider
totally
unfair,
it
doesn't
matter
on
your
view
of
this
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's...
that's
standard
for
judgments
anyway.
when
the
judgment
is
final,
it
means
you've
gotten
through
the
first...
it
has
preclusive
effect.
almost
always,
when
a
judgment
is
overturned
on
appeal,
then
you
go
back
to
state
2
and
say,
look,
it's
been
overturned
on
appeal,
and
at
least
in
the
civil
side,
almost
always
state
2
will
say,
okay,
we'll
give
you
post-judgment
relief
because
what
we
were
relying
on
as
our
sister
state
judgment
is
no
longer
on
the
books.
i
can't
imagine
that
in
our
criminal
system
it
doesn't
work
the
same
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
if
it's
alien
in
our
criminal
justice
system,
not
in
deportation,
not
in...
extradition
is
somebody
who
did
somebody...
something
abroad,
and
we
don't
send
people
just
to
anyplace.
don't
we
have
to
have
a
treaty?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
the
person
is
going
to
be
tried
in
that
other
system,
and
we
have
bound...
within
our
international
system,
we
say
we're
part
of
a
world
community
and
we
want
japan
to
extradite
people
who
have
done
bad
things
here
to
the
united
states,
and
so
similarly,
we
will
extradite
to
japan.
we
don't
want
them
to
look
at
our
system
and
judge
it.
we're
sending
somebody
to
be
tried
there.
so
extradition
is...
is
something
entirely
different
than--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
we
have
the
check
already
that
these
are...
these
places
with
whom
we
want
to
do
criminal
justice
business
together.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
then
we
have
the...
we
have
the
document
where
it's
very
clear
we
want
to
have
extradition
with
the
uk,
with
japan.
here,
you're
relying
on
the
word
court,
and
you
don't
have
it
all
spelled
out
like
you
do
in
an
extradition
treaty.
and
that's
the
problem
here.
sure,
if
congress
had
said
we
mean
foreign
court,
then
that
would
be
it,
but
it
hasn't
said
that
and
we
have
to
determine
does
it
mean
the
same
thing
as
it
means
in
the
extradition
context
or
the
deportation
context
where
you
have
a
clear
statement
that
congress
means
a
tribunal
abroad.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
somebody
is
coming
into
the
country,
somebody
is
asking
to
come
in,
any
conviction
that
you're
talking
about,
of
course,
refers
to
someplace
abroad.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ms.
millett.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
millett,
there
are
many
lawyers
in
congress
and
at
least
the
law
students
of
my
generation...
some
of
them
are
of
that
elder
age.
we
learned
in
law
school
one
country
doesn't
enforce
the
penal
judgments
of
another.
this
is
a
kind
of
enforcement
of
a
penal
judgment
of
another,
not
exactly,
but
something
like
it.
another
reason
why
i
would
expect
a
congress,
knowing
that
background
norm,
would
say,
when
it
meant
foreign,
foreign.
unlike
the
context
of
the
immigration,
yes,
there
are
some
people
who
left
and
came
back,
but
many...
and...
and
we
have
all
this
whole
line
of
cases.
is
adultery
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude,
and
you
know,
those
go
back
to
the
'20's.
but
this,
which
came
about
only
because
of
the
merger
of
two
statutes,
one
saying
federal
and
state,
the
other
not,
and
no
explanation
at
all,
in
light
of
all
these
anomalies
that
have
been
brought
out.
shouldn't
we
say
to
congress
maybe
that's
what
you
meant,
but
if
you
did,
you
have
an
opportunity
to
say
so
before
we
read
in
foreign?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
why?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
why
they
stopped
funding
it?
why
did...
because
i
think
that's
been
reenacted
every
year.
no
money
for
this.
why...
why
did
congress
stop
funding
it?
