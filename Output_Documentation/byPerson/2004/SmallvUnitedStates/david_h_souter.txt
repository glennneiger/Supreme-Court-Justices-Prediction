justice
david
h.
souter
well,
ms....
ms.
millett,
my...
my
problem
with
that
argument
and
i
guess
my
basic
problem
with...
with
the
case
is
congress
did
not
just
sort
of
stop
when
it
got
to
the
point
that
would
support
your
lewis
argument.
it
went
a
step...
it
went
several
steps
further.
but
one
of
the
steps
further
that
it
went
to
was...
was
in...
in
a
certain
fussiness
about
the
definition
of
crime,
and
it
said,
well,
we
want
to
make
sure
that...
that
no
state
or...
or
federal
business
criminals
are...
are
put
at
a
disadvantage
by
this.
it
then
accepted
anything
that
a
state
might
call
a
misdemeanor
if
it
carried
no
more
than
2
years.
and
it
just
seems
very
odd
to
me
that
congress
would
have
been
that
careful
in
putting
these
limitations
on
state
and
federal
crimes
and
would
totally
have
ignored
any
category
of
crime
under
foreign
law,
any
conviction
under
foreign
law
in...
in
light
of
some
of
the
hypotheses
that
have
been
thrown
out
this
morning.
it
just
seems
strange
that
it
would
have
ignored
foreign
law
and
foreign
courts
if
it
thought
they
were
included.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
called
it
that,
but
it
didn't...
it
didn't
have
this
issue
in
front
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
realize
you've
got
the
language,
but
it...
it
wasn't
addressing
this
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
was
talking
about
our
language.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
and
i
think
that
ought
to
count
for
a
lot
too.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
how...
how
familiar
an
example
is
it
that
price-fixers
would...
would
be
placed
in...
in
a
terrible
position
if
they
couldn't
carry
guns?
i
mean,
that
was
not
a
pressing
problem,
so
far
as
i
know.
and
yet,
congress
dealt
with
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
it
can
deal
with
a
problem
that
is
as
little
pressing
as
that,
it
seems
odd
that
it
would
not
have
averted
in
any
way
to
equally
non-pressing
problems
under...
under
foreign
convictions
if
that's
what
they
had
in
mind.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
what...
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no.
i...
finish
your
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
there's
no--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
both
know
there's
no--
justice
david
h.
souter
--all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
neither
did
it
give
any
explanation
for
not
carrying
it
forward.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's...
it's
the
silence
at
the...
at
the
time
it...
it
apparently
departed
from
the
practice
of
predecessor
statutes
that...
that
seems
to
be
a
problem
for
your
argument.
