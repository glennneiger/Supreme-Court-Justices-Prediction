ms.
patricia
a.
millett
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
scalia,
you
asked
about
what
case
we
would
want
to
adopt
and
be
our
strongest
case
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
any
in
the
statute,
and
my
answer
to
that
question,
although
i
take
the
liberty
of
answering
it,
though
you
didn't
ask
me--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--is
the
gonzales
case
where
this
court
said
that
the
word
any
in
the
gun
control
law,
in
this
context,
in
this
framework
means,
read
naturally...
i'm
quoting
here.
read
naturally,
the
word
any
has
an
expansive
meaning,
that
is,
one
or
some
indiscriminately
of
whatever
kind.
this
is
not,
justice
ginsburg,
a
statute
where
congress
wrote
sloppily.
in
fact,
in
barrett
and
huddleston,
this
court
specifically
said
and
noted
that
excruciating
care
with
which
congress
wrote
title
iv,
section--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--justice
ginsburg,
this
is
not
an
extraterritorial
application
of
a
statute.
this
regulates
a
threat
to
american
public
safety
within
the
united
states
by
someone
within
the
united
states
based
on
their
conduct,
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
dangerous
person
within
the
united
states.
that
is
not
extraterritorial
application
of
the
law.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that's
no
more--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the...
the
phrase
convicted
in
any
court--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
don't...
i
don't
have
a
case
that
specifically
talks
about--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
yet,
but
if
i
can...
if
i
can
explain
why
the
phrase
convicted
in
any
court...
because
any
any
court...
the...
the
problem
is
you're
not...
there's
not
a
case
for
that.
the
word,
any
court,
that...
those
two
words
appear
in
a
lot
of
places
in
the
united
states
code.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the...
not...
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
but...
but
they
don't...
it...
it
doesn't
address
it
one
way
or
the
other.
most
of
the
times,
the
vast
majority
of
the
times
that
you
see
any
court
in
the
united
states,
it...
in
the
united
states
code,
it's
followed
by
qualifying
terms.
what's
very
important
here
is
that
the
phrase
convicted
in
any
court
without
qualifications.
there's
lots
of
any
courts
in
the
united
states--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--justice
stevens,
if
i
could
make
two
points.
again,
convicted
in
any
court
is
rarely
employed
by
congress.
rarely.
and
we've
cited
in
our
brief
on
the
occasions
it
has
been
employed,
the
context
and
structure
are
wholly
consistent
with
including
foreign
judgments.
the
patriot
act
created
a
ban
on
the
possession
of
biological
agents
or
toxins,
and
it...
it
picked
up
this
same
phrase
and
put
it
in
there,
and
i
think
it
is...
would...
and
that
is
also
a
statute
that
in
a
separate
provision
has
extraterritorial
application.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it...
it's...
i
can't
give
you
an
exact
number
because
we--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--we
don't
know
about
the
ones
that
we
never
hear
about.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it's...
it's
not
that...
i
would...
i
would
say
there's
probably
10
to
a
dozen,
but
i...
i
have
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--since
1968.
it's
been
on
the
books
since
1968.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
justice
breyer...
and
justice
stevens,
i
do
want
to
get
back
because
i
do
have
a
lower
court
case
that
interprets
any
court
in
the
way
you
discussed.
i
want
to
get
back
to
that.
but
justice
breyer,
i
understand
this
being
a
very
important
concern,
and...
and
there
are
no
doubt
particular
applications
that
could
seem
unappealing,
just
as
in
lewis
v.
united
states
where
this
court
held
that
an
invalid,
a
patently
unconstitutional
state
conviction
counts
for
section
922(g)(1).
the
reason
that
the...
the
convictions
are
covered
here
is
congress
was
not--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--lewis
v.
united
states,
and
that
is...
that's
really
our
favorite
case,
although
we
like
the
word
of...
definition
gonzales
has
for
any.
but
in
lewis
v.
united
states,
this
court
addressed
the
question
whether
the
ban
on
possession
of
firearms
by
someone
convicted
of,
i'll
say,
a
felony,
a
term
of
imprisonment
of
more
than
1
year,
applies
to...
to
convictions
that
are
allegedly
unconstitutional
under
state
law
or
may,
in
fact,
be
unconstitutionally
entered.
they
could
have
been
the
product
of
a
coerced
confession.
the
allegation
there
was
lack
of
representation
of
counsel.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
justice
ginsburg,
in
daniels
v.
united
states,
which
dealt
with
924,
the
sentencing
enhancement
provision,
but
it
has
a...
the
parallel
and
incorporates
922(g)(1)
convictions,
this
court
held...
a
plurality
of
this
court
held
in
five
opinions
that...
in
fact,
that
the...
the
bar...
or
that
you
still
count
an
unconstitutional
or
allegedly
unconstitutional
state
conviction,
even
if
it
was
never
appealed
and
that...
and
there
is
no
more
opportunity
for
appeal.
the
time
has
passed.
and
under
922(g)(1),
we
also
count.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes,
but
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
it
does
certainly
in
this
case.
he
could
have
appealed
his
conviction
in
japan
and
he
did
not.
so
he
had
a
forum
to
do
that
in.
but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that...
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
is...
you
know,
the...
the
statute
also
bars
receipt
of
firearms
by
anyone
who's
under
indictment.
and
that
application
applies
even
though
you
can't
appeal,
except
for
exceptional
circumstances.
you
can't
appeal
an
indictment.
and
the
922(g)(1)
bar,
this
court's
decision
in
lewis
made
clear,
is
that
it
still
applies
unless
and
until
your
conviction
is
overturned.
so
you
don't
have
to
have
had
a...
a
conviction
vetted
through
the
appellate
process
before
the
bar
attaches.
in...
in
the
immigration
context--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
certainly
in
immigration
and
extradition,
you
don't
get
to
appeal
the
validity
of
your
foreign
conviction
or
the...
the
processes
that
led
to
it.
so
this
is
not
an
alien
concept.
and
it's
very
important
to
understand
what
congress
was
doing
here.
this
isn't--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
we
have
treaties
with
more
than
100
countries
and
we
don't...
and...
and
the
courts
do
not
examine
the
fairness
of
the
proceedings
or--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--although
we...
we
do
also
extradite,
just
to
serve
sentences,
where
there
may
have
already
been
a
trial
that
could
be
as
flawed
as
anyone
could
conceive
or
articulate.
so--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
what
we
have
is
the
check
that
the
political
branches
have
decided
that
it's
important
to
attach
significance
to
foreign
court--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--in
fact,
in
8
u.s.c.
1182(a)
which...
which...
inadmissibility
criterion
for
aliens,
convictions
of
moral
turpitude,
there's
no
reference
to
whether
it's
a
conviction
by
a
foreign
court
or
a
domestic
court.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no.
no,
it
doesn't,
justice
ginsburg,
because
frequently
and
throughout
that
same
statute,
it
refers
to
convictions
in
the
united
states.
a
lot
of
times
the
reason
for
inadmissibility,
including
the
mariel
cubans
cases
this
court
heard
last
month,
is...
is
convictions
committed
in
the
united
states.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
now,
surely
the
context--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes,
justice
stevens.
and
i
think
that's
an
important
thing
here.
there
has
been
no
contest,
for
obvious
reasons...
we're
dealing
with
japan...
as
to
what
congress
meant
by
court.
and
sometimes
if
it's
saddam
hussein's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--through
traditional
rules
of
statutory
construction.
i
think
that
would
involve
looking
at
the
other...
the...
the
background
that
congress
would
have
enacted
the
statute
against,
first
of
all,
and
that...
that
may
well
have...
it
may
not
have
been
courts
of
just
the
united
states
because,
as
we
know,
congress
twice
deleted
that
limitation
from
the
statute.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i...
i
am...
i
am
conceding
that...
that
it
has
to
be
given
meaning.
i
don't
know
that
i
would
call
it
ambiguous,
is
we
have
to
figure
out.
but
i...
what
i
will
say
is
that
the
phrase--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--any...
it
has
to
be...
it
has
to
be
a
court
capable
of
entering
convictions.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it's
ambiguous
in
a
sense--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
right.
and...
and
i
think,
in
addition,
we
don't
decide
that
a
word
is
ambiguous
just
at
looking
at
that
word.
we
would
look
at
the
overall
structure
of
the
statute,
and
we
would
decide
that
it
has
to
be
a
governmental
entity
capable
of
entering
convictions.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
absolutely,
justice--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
justice
scalia.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
would
hope
not,
justice
scalia.
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i...
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that...
well,
again,
just
last...
this
isn't...
this
isn't
quite
the
same
context.
but
just
this...
just
last
term
in
the
cheney
case,
this
court
recognized
the
limitations
on
prosecutors.
and
in
atwater
v.
city
of
lago
vista,
in
determining
the
scope
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
capacity
to
arrest
for
misdemeanors,
this
court
recognized
that
not
all
checks
have
to
come
from
the
courts.
they
can
come
from
the
political
process
here.
and
it's
very
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
these
hypothesized
problems,
bad
applications,
are
that.
purely
hypothesized.
this
has
been
on
the
books
for
almost
40
years.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
in
beecham
v.
united
states,
in
justice
o'connor's
opinion
for
the
court,
this
court
recognized
there...
it
was
dealing
with
another
issue,
whether
the
jurisdiction
that
restores
civil
rights
is
different
from
the
convicting
jurisdiction.
it
said
we
don't
have
any
way
of
knowing
whether
congress
thought
about
that.
that's
not
the
question.
congress
passed
a
statute
here.
it
passed
a
statute
that's
been
written
very
carefully.
it's
passed
a
statute
where
the
definition
of
the
word
any
in
the
statute
has
already
been
defined.
and
the...
what
the
statute
has
been
used
for
is
to
prosecute
exactly
the
people
that
congress
wanted
to
capture.
it's
international
gun
smugglers--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--violent
assailants--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
don't
think
it's
strange
at
all,
justice
souter,
and
that
is
because
that
the
business
exception,
if
i
can
call
it
that,
is
a
carve-out.
what
you
have
here,
in
this
court's
word,
is
a
sweeping
prophylaxis
against
the
misuse
of
firearms.
that's
what
this
court
called
it
in
lewis,
a
sweeping
prophylaxis.
and
what
congress
did
was
back
out--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's...
that's
right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
right,
and...
and
the
language
should
be
what
counts
most.
but
beyond
that,
you're
talking
about
congress--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
you--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but
what
congress
was
doing
there
was
backing
out.
it
was
making
an
exception,
and
it
was
doing
this
against
a
backdrop
of
a
lot
of
violence
with
guns.
and
so
it
makes
sense
that
congress
would
proceed
carefully
and
deal
with
matters
with
which
it
was
familiar
and
not
want
to
carve
out
things
that
it
wasn't
familiar
with.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
the
problem--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
dealt
with
that.
i
mean,
specifically
at
the
legislative
history
level,
it
dealt...
it
enacted
that
statutory
exception
because
some
states
had
made
these
types
of
business
crimes
punishable
on
more
than
a
year.
so
that's
what
it
was
responding
to.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
can't...
i--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
can't...
i'm
not
going
to
stand
here
and
tell
you
that
congress
specifically
thought
about
this.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
right,
but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but...
but
what
congress
did
here...
and
it's
very
important
to
understand...
it
was
throwing
a
broad
net--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--two
answers,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
this
was
the
second
time
in
1986
that
congress
refused
to
include
that
limitation
on
courts.
the
prior
law,
before
the
1968
act,
specifically
referred
to
courts
of
the
united
states,
states,
and
territories.
it
did
not
pick
up
that
language
in
title
iv
in
1968,
and
they
took
it
out--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
but
i
don't...
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but...
but
again,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
characterized
as
silence
congress'
twice
deletion
of
language
from
a
statute
in
1968
and
again
in
1986.
it
had
it.
it
looked
at
it.
it
took
it
out.
and
in
1986
in
the
senate
report
that
you
were
referring
to,
justice
ginsburg,
earlier,
congress
said
they...
the
conference
report
said
we
are
rejecting
the
senate's
definition
of
felony.
the
other
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
when
congress
enacted
this
statute
in
1968,
it
also
enacted
an
administrative
mechanism
for
relief
that
would
deal
with
exactly
the
uncomfortable
situations
that
have
been
identified.
925(c)
allows
an
administrative
waiver
in
cases
where
an
individual
comes
and
says
i
don't
want
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think...
it's,
of
course,
the
legislature
and
the
president's
signature.
i'd
like
to
put
a
plug
in
for
the
executive
in...
in
that
reference,
but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
stevens,
the
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
here
is
we
don't
just
have
a
statute
that
appeared
out
of
nowhere.
it's
been
on
the
books
for
a
long
time
and
there
was
a
legislative--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
but
it
thought...
it--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--exactly,
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
if
nothing
else...
and
this
guy
is
squarely
within
what
congress
wanted
to
capture.
if
nothing
else,
you
don't
have
to
decide
anything
more
in
this
case
than
that
it
covers
persons
like
this
whose
convictions
are
fundamentally
fair
and
it's
not
contested
and
could
leave
for
another
day...
but
let's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
he
got...
in
this
case,
he
got...
and
this
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--you...
you
go
and
you
fill
out
a
form
that
says,
as
this
case
did...
and
it's
on
page
4
of
our
brief--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--asked
him,
have
you
been
convicted
in
any
court
of--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--in
any
court.
and
i
think
when
someone--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no.
but
when
someone
has
a
conviction,
when
you
have
a
felony
conviction,
you're
on
some
notice
of
inquiry.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
justice--
ms.

--well--
ms.
patricia

--and
it's
in
925(c),
which
is
on--
ms.

--page
65a
of
our
brief.
but
let
me...
let
me
be--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
does,
and...
but
let
me
be
candid
up
front.
congress
stopped
funding
this
administrative
mechanism
in
1992,
and
that...
this
court
addressed
that
in
the
bean
case.
it...
it
doesn't
exist
now,
but
that
was
25
years
after
congress
wrote
this
language
and
put
it
in
the
statute,
and
the
fact
that
they
stopped
funding
it
25
years
later
doesn't
mean
the
statute
doesn't
mean
what
it
said.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
congress--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--because
some
of...
some
of
the
people
who
were
getting
waivers
were
going
out
and
committing
crimes
again.
congress
here
is
very
concerned
about
public
safety.
and
this
is
not...
there
was,
you
know,
the
question,
is
there
ever
an
element
where
you
treat
this
like
an
element
of
foreign
crime.
there
aren't...
there
aren't
crimes
normally
where
you
treat
indictments
or
someone
being
under
a
restraining
order
this
way.
this
is
not
punishing
you
for
your
foreign
crime.
this
is
a
global
categorical,
class-wide
judgment
that
as
a
class
persons
who
have
committed
crimes
overseas
are
more
dangerous
and
may
pose
exactly
the
public
safety
risk
we
wanted
to
grab
and
stop.
as
a
class,
they
do
that.
in
a
particular
case,
it
may
not.
in
a
particular
case,
an
indictment
might
not.
congress
was
speaking
globally.
it
did
so.
it
threw
a
broad
net.
it
did
so
at
the
time
it
had
an
administrative
check
to
deal
with
these
problems.
yes,
that's
gone.
that
doesn't
retroactively
change
what
the
statutory
language
meant.
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
that
this
statutory
language
in
922
was
written,
in
beecham
and
huddleston,
with
such
care
that
congress
was
focused
on
the
difference
between
the
present
perfect
and
the
past
tense,
this
court
said
in
barrett.
this
is
not
sloppy
writing.
when
congress
put
any
court
in
and
did
not
carry
forward
a
limitation
to
the
courts
of
the
united
states
and
took
that
out
in
another
part
of
the
statute
in
1986,
we
have
to
assume
that
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing.
if
there
were
problems
here,
there
is
a
political
process
to
deal
with
it.
the
political
process
has
taken
away
the
administrative
waiver.
but
there
has
not
been...
this
hypothesis
of
bad
applications
has
not
arisen.
it's
hypothesized.
and
what
this
statute
has...
has
been
used
to
do
is
capture
exactly
the
people
congress
wanted
to
capture.
it
got
exactly
the
ones
who
should
be
disarmed.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i...
i
am
confident
that
the
atf
would
be
happy
to
do
that.
as
of
now,
the
atf
has
a
regulation
on
the
books
for
someone
to
look
at
and
see
that
includes
foreign
convictions
in
this
definition.
and
i
think
when
someone
has
been
convicted,
they're
on
notice.
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
