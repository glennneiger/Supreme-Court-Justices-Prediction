mr.
boas,
the
court
will
hear
argument
in
small
against
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
boas,
i
think
you
make
a
strong
argument
that
congress
probably
didn't
think
of
this
particular
problem.
do
you
suppose
if
at
the
hearings
before
the
committee,
the
process
of
the
legislation,
some
witness
came
in
and
said,
do
you
realize
this
language
is
so
broad
it
will
cover
the
person
who
is
convicted
of
a
felony
in
japan,
as
well
as
person
who's
convicted
of
a
felony
in
illinois,
do
you
think
they
would
have
modified
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
would
have
been
a
need
to
under
your
view
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
suppose
somebody
on
the
committee
might
have
said,
well,
we
don't
want
this
kind
of
person
to
have
a
gun,
and
the
fact
he's
convicted
in
japan
rather
than
in
brooklyn
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
with
regard
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
this
person--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
convicted
in
japan
and
he
somehow
got
to
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--maybe
you
can
think--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--maybe
you
can
think
of
a
unanimous
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry.
you've
exhausted
your
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
millett.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
let
me
just
interrupt
on
your...
your
best
case
suggestion.
i
don't
think
the
test
is
when
has
the
word
any
been
used
in
different
ways,
but
has
the
word
any
court
ever
been
used
by
congress
to
include
foreign
courts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i'm
asking
about
just
the
words,
any
court.
what's
your
best
case
for
the
proposition
that
that
would
normally
be
construed
by
congress
to
include
foreign
courts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
a
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
they
ever
refer
to
foreign
courts?
that's
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
reason
you
often
need
qualification
is
there's...
there's
sort
of
basic
question,
does
this
include
state
courts
as
where
as...
as
well
as
federal,
and
it's
often
necessary
to
spell
it
out
one
way
or
the
other.
but
i
don't...
i'm
not
aware
of
any
precedent
for
trying
to
decide
whether
it
also
embraces
foreign
courts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
interrupt
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--this
colloquy
to
raise
another
question,
if
i
may?
would
you
concede
that
there
are
some
tribunals
in
the
world
that
are
comparable
to
what
you
might
call
a
kangaroo
court
that
congress
would
not
have
intended
to
include
within
the
term
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
are
we
to
decide
whether
such
tribunal
should
be
treated
as
a
court
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
when
there
is
no
statutory
definition
of
the
term
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
concede
that
there
are
some
tribunals
that
are
not
courts
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
are
you
not
conceding
that
the
word
court
is
inherently
ambiguous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
something
less
than
the
all-inclusive
term,
any
court,
in
a
literal
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
know
any
cases
in
which
we've
construed
a
statute
narrowly
on
the
ground
that
we're
confident
the
prosecutor
won't
bring
any
such
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's...
it's
been
on
the
books
for
so
long
with
very,
very
few
prosecutions.
so
it's
one...
it's
not
exactly
an
urgent
question.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
if
this...
this
problem
had
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress,
they
would
have
defined
the
term
court,
and
i
don't...
they
haven't
done
that
but
probably
because
they
didn't
think
of
the
problem.
and
you
can
argue,
well,
they
surely
would
have
wanted
to
have
this
particular
person
prosecuted,
but
would
they
have
wanted
everyone
with
every
foreign
court
all
over
the
world.
that's
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
know,
this
is
a
very
interesting
case
because
there
are
three
ways
to
answer
the
question
of
what
is
a
court.
you
can
leave
it
up
to
us
to
do
it,
and
that
would
be
judicial
legislation
to
fill
in
a
hole
in
the
statute.
you
can
have
the
executive
do
it,
decide
what
case...
what
cases
to
prosecute,
or
if
we
should
knock
out
this...
interpret
the
statute
in
the...
in
a
different
way
than
you
urge,
congress
would
then
do
it.
now,
which
of
the
three
is
the
better
lawmaker
on
deciding
which
is
the...
what
should
the
meaning
of
the
word
court
be?
the
executive,
the
legislature,
or
the
judiciary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
is
pretty
clear
that
congress
didn't
really
think
about
this
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
was
also
clear
on
your
side
that
they
would
like
to
prevent
this
guy
from
having
a
gun.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
are
two
competing
considerations,
both
of
which
are
very
powerful.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
