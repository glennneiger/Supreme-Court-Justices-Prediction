no.
well,
but...
but
justice
scalia's
point...
and
i...
i
think
he's
correct...
is
that
this
cuts
at
least
as
much
in
favor
of
the
government
as
you
and
probably
more
because
you
would
make
federal
and
state
unnecessary
surplus.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't...
you
don't
set
forth
the
main
qualification
to
the
main
definition
in
a...
in
a
later
subsection.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it's
a...
if
it's
a
matter
of
notice
and...
then
that's
a
separate
issue.
plus
the
government,
it
seems
to
me,
should
put
on
its
form
that
this
includes
foreign
conviction,
and
that
solves
that
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
it
doesn't...
it's...
it's
not
a
tennis
court
or
an
inner
court.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
somebody
asked
where
this
man
was
convicted,
they'd
say
in
a
japanese
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
would
save
us
a
lot
of
work.
we--
[laughter]
--we
could
just
invalidate
all
statutes
that
we
don't
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
know
anybody
in
the
justice
department
you
might
talk
to
to
amend
this
form
so
that
the
form
says
this
includes
convictions
in
foreign
countries?
