justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
they
say
any
state
or
federal?
i
mean,
in...
in
a
way
this
provision...
you...
you
may
say
that
the...
that
the
substantive
effect
of
the
provision
supports
your
interpretation,
but
the
text
of
the
provision
supports
the
government's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
if
any
only
means
state
or
federal,
there
was
no
need
to
say
state
or
federal
in
this
provision.
you
could
have
simply
said
any
in
this
provision,
just
as
you
said
it
elsewhere.
so
one
would
think
that
they
said
state
or
federal
because
they
wanted
to
exclude
foreign
antitrust
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
care
how
it
got
there.
i'm
just
saying
there...
there...
if...
if
any
means
what
you
said
it
means,
namely
state
or
federal,
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
limit
this
other
provision
to
state
or
federal
because
the
whole
statute
would
only
cover
state
or
federal.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think...
let...
let's
put,
you
know,
the
worst
for
you.
if
it
were
put
to
congress,
which
would
you
prefer,
that...
that
solzhenitsyn
not
be
able
to
have
a
gun
or
that
the
worst
kind
of
violent
criminal
convicted
and
imprisoned
and
escaped
from
a
foreign
country
who
manages
to
get
into
this
country
can
go
in
and
buy
a
gun?
which...
which
of
these
two
would
you
prefer?
and
i
think
i'd
say,
well,
you
know,
it's
tough
on
solzhenitsyn
he
can't
own
a
gun,
but
he'll
probably
get
over
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
doesn't
cover
americans,
of
course--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
go...
go
and
commit
crimes
abroad,
are
convicted
abroad,
and...
and
come
back
to
home
sweet
home
and
then
get
a
gun.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
to
me
extraordinary.
i
don't
think
congress
would
have
wanted
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
if
there
was
a
problem
that...
that
they
were
going
to
leave
unsolved,
it
is
less
likely
the
problem
of
having
an
american
citizen
killed
by
a
gun
toted
by
somebody
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
abroad
than
it
is
the
problem
of
somebody
having
been
convicted
abroad
of
some
silly
crime
like
wearing
a
veil
or
not
wearing
a
veil
or
something
else.
if...
if
it's
either
of
those
two
problems
that
they
meant
to
leave
overlooked,
i
would
say
it's
the
latter.
they
might
well
have
said,
well,
the
courts
will
take
care
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
is
that
defined?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
that...
that
cuts
both
ways.
why
would
they...
if
the
text
reads
the
way
you
say
it
reads,
why
did
they
have
to
say
is
a
misdemeanor
under
federal
or
state
law?
because
it
wouldn't
have
mattered.
the
only
courts...
the
only
convictions
that
would
be
covered
would
be
federal
or
state
convictions.
they
would
not
need
that...
that
qualification.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
the
question
the...
the
chief
justice
would
ask,
were
he
here,
because
he
always
asked
this
kind
of
a
question.
what...
if
you
had
to
pick
your
best
case
of
ours
which
interpreted
the
word
any
in
the
way
that
you
would
like
us
to
interpret
here,
what's...
what's
the
best
case
you
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
good
question.
he
asked
a
good
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
call
that
fopa?
that's
the
name
of
the
statute?
[laughter]
it's
an
unfortunate
acronym,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
recidivism
is
an
element
of
the
crime.
if...
if
you
have
a
crime
of,
you
know,
repeated
felony,
recidivism
is
an
element.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
ask
it
as
well--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
assume
that
there's
some
prosecutorial
discretion
in
the
application
of
this
statute?
i
mean,
have
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--have
you
prosecuted
any...
any
woman
who
tried
to
buy
a
firearm
because
she
had
been
convicted
of
wearing...
not...
not
wearing
a
veil?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
any
united
states
attorney
would
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
or...
or
somebody
who
was
convicted
of
treason
in
cuba?
you...
you
think
that...
that
that
would
be
a...
a
case
that
would
be
prosecuted
vigorously
by
a
united
states
attorney?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
not
too
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
would...
would
you
finish...
would
you
finish
please--
justice
antonin
scalia
--telling
us
about
the
administrative
waiver
proceeding?
you
were
in
the
middle
of
it
and
i
never
heard
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it
provides
judicial
review
of
the
attorney
general's
failure
to
give
the
waiver.
