justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why...
why
did
florida
deny
relief
in...
in
the
post-conviction?
i
mean,
one
reason
that
looks
like
it
might
apply
is
that
florida
had
a
2
year
statute
of
limitations
and
this
was
brought
up
14
years
later.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
counsel...
what...
what
he
alleges
counsel
told
him
was,
in
fact,
accurate
at
the
time
counsel
said
it,
that
somebody
who
got
a
99-year
sentence
wouldn't
have
to
serve
more
than
13
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
go
back
to
the
district
court
before
the
eleventh
circuit?
you've
now
told
me
that
the
ground
on
which
the
florida
court
denied
relief
was
not
based
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
federal
court,
what
is
the
ground
on
which
relief
was
denied
and
how
would
artuz
affect
that
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the...
you...
you
said
60(b)
fits
this
like
a
glove
because
it's
the
district
court
correcting
its
own
errors.
but
it
isn't
usually...
60(b)
was
framed
with
the
idea
of
the
district
court
being
the
very
first
instance
court.
and
here
you
will
have
the
district
court
as
the
third
going
up
the
ladder.
so...
and...
and
given
that
the
habeas
rules
say
that...
that
civil
rules
are
applicable
but
have
to
be
modified
to
be
compatible
with
habeas
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
an
exaggeration
of
how
60(b)
works
in
practice?
it
isn't
that
every
civil
judgment
can
come
back
and
back
again
with
60(b)
motions.
the
district
courts
have
been
rather
disciplined
in
handling
60(b)
motions.
so
i
think
you
have
exaggerated
what
60(b)
does
in
the
ordinary
civil
rules
context.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kise,
this
may
be
important.
do
you
agree
with
mr.
rashkind
that
in
the
florida
court
the
dismissal
or
the
denial
of
relief
was
not
on
the
florida
statute
of
limitations--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it's
not...
not
clear
from--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
not
what
the...
this
is...
the...
the
form
of
dismissal
in
the
florida
supreme
court
doesn't
tell
us
that.
it
just
says
something
about
allegations
contained
therein
do
not
constitute
legal
grounds
for
granting
the
new
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
one
was
on
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
that
anyplace
in...
in
the
papers
before
us,
the
first...
the
first
dismissal
in
the
florida...
in
the
florida
trial
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
it
was
based
on
the
florida
2-year
statute
of
limitations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
congress
rule...
rule
out
60(b)
in...
in
death
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
i
may
be
wrong
about
having--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
there
was
a
special
provision
for
capital
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
federal
court
make
a
mistake
of...
of
law
if
the...
if
the
florida
court
dismissed
under
the
florida
2-year
statute
of
limitations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
no.
did
the
federal
court.
and
suppose
that
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
sub
judice,
before
us
now.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
you
agree
with
mr.
kise
that
the
first
dismissal
in
the
florida
court,
the
first
denial
was
on
the
florida
2-year
statute
of
limitations?
