h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
aurelio
gonzalez
v.
james
crosby.
mr.
rashkind.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
still
very
vague.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
is
going
to
be
taken
up
by
some
800
district
judges
and
a
couple
hundred
appellate
judges,
and
they're
the
ones
who
have
the
final
say
in
most
of
these
cases
just
because
we
decide
so
few.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
not
talking
about
ordinary
appellate
review.
we're
talking
about
an
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
by
a
federal
habeas
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
wasn't
quite
as
strange
as
you
make
it
sound.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
maybe
that's
what
congress
wanted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
bring
this
all
to
a
halt?
i
mean,
there's
always
one
more
argument
to
make
that
the
last
court
to
rule
against
me
was
wrong.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rashkind.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kise,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
claim
that
a
witness
perjured
himself,
a
witness
for
the
government,
during
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kise.
ms.
millett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
mr.
rashkind,
you
have
4
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rashkind.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
gonzales
against
crosby
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
