justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
were
to
make
clear
that
60(b)
is
widely
available,
even
category
six,
don't
you
think...
and
as
a
result
the
aedpa
restrictions
don't
apply,
don't
you
think
that
number
would
increase
rather
dramatically?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there's
no
language
in
category
six
referring
to
extraordinary
circumstances,
any
other
reason
justifying
relief.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
aren't
we
dealing
here
with
a
time
bar
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
there...
there
was
not
a
determination
below,
but
an
extraordinary
amount
of
time
expired
before
the
application
was
made.
why
would
that
count
as
some
extraordinary
circumstance?
why
shouldn't
the
petitioner
be
stuck
with
the
time
bar?
i
don't
see
how
this
fits
even
under
your
proposed
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
has
that
been
determined--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--by
some
court?
that's
the
allegation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--pure
and
simple--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yet
to
be
determined.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
we
have
to
know
how
the
time
bar
element
folds
in
here,
and
in
an
ordinary
civil
case,
a
time
bar
would
be
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
i
mean,
that...
that
would
end
the
case,
and
why
would
it
be
a
different,
more
liberal
rule
in
habeas?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
why
isn't
that
always
the
case
if
it's
time-barred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it's
time-barred,
you
never
have
your
chance
to
have
the
merits
argued.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
the
federal
government
has
a
different
proposed
rule
than
yours.
are
you
going
to
comment
on
their
proposal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
say
that
again?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
how
do
you
apply
it
in
this
case,
the
artuz
problem?
