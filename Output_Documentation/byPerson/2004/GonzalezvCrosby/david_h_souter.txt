justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
counsel,
what...
that...
that
brings
me
to
a
question
that
i
don't
understand
about
your
argument.
it
seems
to
me
you're
biting
off
more
than
you
have
to
bite
off
here.
would
you
win
on
the
following
argument?
and
i
will
tell
you
in
advance
that
it
looks
to
me
as
though
you
would.
but
maybe
there's
some
reason
you're
not
making
it.
number
one,
your
statute
of
limitations
claim
is
not
the
kind
of
claim
that
aedpa
is
concerned
with
when
it
deals
with
limits
on
second
and
successive
petitions.
number
two,
although
a
statute
of
limitations
issue
is
on
the
merits,
it
is
not
on
the
merits
in
the
second
or
successive
petition
category.
in
this
case,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
making
a...
an...
an
aedpa
end
run
so
far
as
second
or
successive
goes,
and
therefore,
60(b)
can
be
used
simply
not
as
a
wide-open
door,
but
as
a
door
that
could
be
opened
when
your
claim
is
a
claim
about
a
rule
that
barred
you
from
getting
into
federal
court,
which
is
what
the
statute
of
limitations
rule
does.
that's
all
you're
asking
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
finally,
you
have
an
extraordinary
situation
here
because
you
have
a
later
determination
in
artuz
which
declared
the
law
not
as
a
change
in
the
law,
but
as
what
the
law
presumably
meant
from
day
one.
as
i
understand
it,
if
we
accepted
that
argument,
you
would
win.
do
you
agree?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
don't
you
make
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your...
your
immediate
concern
is
how
do
i
get
into
a
federal
court.
whether
you
win
or
lose
once
you
get
in
there
is
another
problem,
but
i...
as
i
understand
it,
that's
not
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
and...
and
the...
you...
you
were
kept
out
of
the
district
court
on
a
statute
of
limitations
issue.
if
you
can
say...
if
you
argue
all
i've
got
in
front
of
you,
us,
is
a
statute
of
limitations
issue,
that's
all
i
want
under...
to
raise
under
60(b)
and
i
have
an
extraordinary
claim
here
because
of
the
subsequent
artuz
decision,
that
will
get
you
into
federal
court,
if
we
accept
that
argument.
whether...
whether
you
win
or
lose,
once
you
get
there,
i
don't
know,
and
i
don't
know
that
that's
before
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
depends--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
but
his...
his
whole
argument
is
you,
state,
get
exactly
what
you're
entitled
to
if
i
win
on
60(b)
because
what
i
was
entitled
to
and
what
you
were
entitled
to
was
the
1-year
statute
but
subject
to
the
rule
in
artuz.
that's
all
you
get,
state.
and
what
he
is
saying
is,
i
want
to
get
back
into
court
so
that
i
can
have
the
statute
of
limitations...
the
benefit
of
the
statute
of
limitations
as
artuz
construed
it.
that
means
you,
state,
get
what
you
want
and
i
get
my
one
chance.
how
is
that
an
open
door
to
the
abuse
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
got
what
artuz
said
was
an
erroneous
view
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
do
you...
do
you
think
that
there
is...
that
there
is
this...
this
sort
of
tidal
wave
of...
of
erroneous
statute
of
limitations
determinations
that,
if
artuz
is
applied,
will
suddenly
be
coming
5,
10,
and
20
years
into
federal
court?
i
mean,
it...
it...
your
argument,
in
relation
to
his
particular
claim
seems
exaggerated.
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
were
there
for
the
purpose
of
getting
him
booted
out.
i
mean,
you
didn't...
you
didn't
get
into
the
merits
of
anything.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
there
had
been
an
artuz
violation
and
not
every
statute
of
limitations
determination
implicates
artuz.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what...
what
congress
was
principally
concerned
with...
congress
was
concerned
with
two
things.
it
was
concerned
with
second
and
successive.
that's
not
what
is
before
us.
congress
was
also
concerned
with
a
1-year
statute
of
limitations.
what
is
before
us
on
that
point
is
that
this
guy
did
not
get
the
benefit
of
the
statute
of
limitations
that
he
had
a
right
to
get
the
benefit
of,
that
there
was
a
flat
mistake
of
law.
so
by...
by
recognizing
his
statute
of
limitations
claim,
we
do
not
open
the
door
to
second
and
successive
litigation.
we
open
the
door
simply
to
artuz
problems
on
statute
of
limitations
rulings
and
that's
a
pretty
narrow
category
it
seems
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
sure,
he
does.
and
if
it's
second
and
successive,
he's
going
to
get
thrown
out
again.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
may...
you
may
be
right,
but
that's
what
district
courts
are
there
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe--
justice
david
h.
souter
--maybe
the
district
court
shouldn't
have
done
that,
but
whatever...
whatever
was
wrong
there,
it
was
merely
a
classic
application
of...
of
review
of
a
statute
of
limitations
point.
there...
there
was
much
else
involved
and
maybe
it
was
improper.
my
question,
i
guess,
is
why
do
you
say
that
the...
why
do
you
assume
that
the
policy
animating
applying
60(b)
to
a
gatekeeping
issue
like
statute
of
limitations,
where
there
is
an
unusual
circumstance
as
in
artuz,
should
be
the
same
policy
that
animates
applying
60(b),
let's
say,
when
there
is
an
attempt
to...
to
make
an
end
run
around
the
second
and
successive
rules?
the
latter
i
think
we
can
all
understand
pretty
readily.
i
mean,
it's
very
important.
you've
got
the...
the...
aedpa
if
you
allow
that.
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
a
statute
of
limitations
problem,
what
the
guy
is
asking
for
is
what
he
was
entitled
to
under
aedpa
as
a
matter
of
timing
and
gatekeeping.
why
is
the
policy
under
60(b)
the
same
in
those
two
cases?
