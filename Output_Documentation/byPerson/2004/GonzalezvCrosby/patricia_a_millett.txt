ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
breyer,
let
me
assure
you
that
our
position
is,
if
not
as
strict,
only
marginally
less
strict
than
the
state
of
florida's.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
okay.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it's
very--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--all
right.
i
wanted
to
make
sure--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes.
and...
and
if
you
want
a
shorter
statement...
i
mean,
a
brief
is
a
brief...
a
short
statement
of
what
our
test
is,
justice
breyer,
it's
quite
simple,
and
that
is
a
rule
60(b)
motion
that
seeks
to
set
aside
a
denial
of
habeas
relief
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
incorrectly
decided
is
barred.
that
is
the
territory
that
aedpa
occupies.
that
includes,
justice
souter,
not
just
determinations
on
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--a
rule
60(b)
motion
that
seeks
to
set
aside
a
final
judgment
denying
federal
habeas
relief
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
incorrectly
decided
is
a
second
or
successive
petition
under
aedpa.
it
can
proceed
only
under
aedpa's
terms,
which
change
not
only
the
standards
for
a
second
decision,
but
the
decision-maker,
the
gatekeeper.
justice
souter--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
right.
it
is...
it
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--okay.
the
flip
side
of
that,
if
i
can...
the...
the
title
of
section
2244
is
finality
of
determination.
if
you
are
seeking
to
upset
a
final
determination,
you
are
governed
by
2244
not
60(b).
if
you
are
not
seeking
to
upset
a
final
determination,
let
me
give
you
the
two...
the
two
circumstances
that
come
to
mind
right
away.
one
is
the
fraud
exception
recognized
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
there
could
be
similar
errors
like
that...
and
this
is
what
we
talk
about
in
our
brief...
that
essentially
vitiate
the
existence
of
a
determination
in
the
first
place.
they
are
that
profound
and
that
rudimentary.
then
you
are
not
upsetting
what
our
system
recognizes
to
be
a
determination
and
what
congress
wanted
you
to
have.
the
other
exception
is
essentially
60(a),
clerical...
you're
not...
errors.
you're
not
really
upsetting
anything.
you're
actually
trying
to
implement
or
effectuate
the
actual
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
only
gap...
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
gap
at
all
after
the
argument
here...
is
that
we
don't
limit
it
to
fraud.
we
recognize
that
there
are
some
other
foundational,
rudimentary,
fundamental
errors
that
conceivably
could
occur.
i'm
not
aware
of
them
happening,
but
something
like
a
biased
judge
addressed
by
this
court
in
toomey
v.
ohio.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
am
saying
a
lot
more
than
that,
and
that
is,
first
of
all,
because
the
vast
majority
of
things
that
are
covered
by
60(b)
do
not
qualify
as
tantamount
to
fraud
or
a
biased
judge.
and...
and
the
second
incredibly
important
thing
is
that
congress
changed
the
decision-maker.
under
60(b),
you
have
645
individual
district
court
judges
applying
the
historic
equity
power
to...
to
overturn
final
judgments.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
with
judge?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
if
that
opinion
is
read...
and
i
think
fairly
it
has
to
be...
as
saying
only
fraud
and
not
errors
of
similar
magnitude
like
a
biased
judge
or
some
other
complete
breakdown
so
that
our
system
doesn't
recognize
that
to
be
a
judgment...
it's
not
what
congress
thought
it
was
giving
you...
then
that
would
be...
i
can't
tell
you
there's
cases
where
this
happens,
but
that...
but
the...
the
rationale
for
including
fraud
would
exclude...
include
some
other
similar
errors
of
magnitude.
that's
our
only--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--in...
in
this
case,
the
artuz
problem
is
only
an
argument,
and
i...
we're
not
even
accepting
that
it's
accurate,
but
only
an
argument
that
the
court
made
a
mistake
of
law.
a
mistake
of
law
is
not
a
fundamental
breakdown
in
our
system.
it
does
not
mean
the
court
didn't
act
as
a
court.
this
court
reverses
in...
or
vacates
in
about
75
of
its
cases.
it
doesn't
mean
all
the
lower
courts
were
not
operating
as
courts
since
we
recognize
them
as
at
the
same
level
of
fraud.
it's
routine
to
have
mistakes
of
law--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--if
he
does
it
within
10
days
under
rule--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--10--
[laughter]
then,
justice
breyer,
the
nature
of
lines
is
somebody
falls
on
the
other
side
sometimes.
there's
an
appeal
process
to
deal
with
exactly
that.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
justice
breyer,
the
problem
is...
and...
and
justice
souter,
you
referenced
this.
there
have
been
many
references
to
this,
that
60(b)
is
not
a
problem.
it's
already
cabined
out
there.
in
fact,
it's
not.
it's
abuse
of
discretion
review
in
courts
of
appeals.
we
cite
a
case,
hamilton
v.
newland,
from
the
ninth
circuit
where
they
used
60(b)(6).
the...
the
petitioner
filed
his
claims.
they
were
clearly
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
not
an
artuz
problem.
so
he
said,
all
right,
i'm
going
back
to
federal
court
with
a
60(b)(6)
claim.
i'm
actually
innocent.
that
puts
me
in
60(b)(6).
i
admit
actual
innocence.
it's...
it's
a
very
weak
claim.
i
can't
been
get
relief
on
it.
but
the
district
court
said,
come
on
in.
i'm
going
to
decide
your
claims.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
the...
and
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--justice
souter,
there's
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
is
that
this
won't
be...
it
will
be
hard
to
limit
this
to
a
statute
of
limitations
because
the
next
argument
is
going
to
be
procedural
default,
and
the
next
argument
is
going
to
be
misapplication
of
teague's
non-retroactivity
principle,
and
the
next
one
is
going
to
be
mistake
in
applying
adequate,
independent
state
grounds.
the...
a
bulk...
a
huge
percentage
of
federal
court
decision-making
in
habeas
cases
is
procedural
rules
because
federal
habeas
is
not
a
roving
commission
for
error
correction.
you
have
to...
at...
in
the
same
breath
that
you
establish
a
constitutional
violation,
you
have
to
show
it's
proper
for
federal
courts
to
act.
procedural
default
and
statute
of
limitations
are
as
much
your
job
to
show
to
have
federal
relief
as
it
is
to
show
that
something
went
wrong
under
the
constitution.
it's
a...
there's
a
dual
character
to
federal
habeas
relief.
so
this,
in
fact,
is
exactly
part
of
the
habeas...
this
is
part
of
the
second
or
successive
determinations
that...
applications
that
congress
wanted
to
bar.
and
we
have
to
step
back
and
think
about
what
would
happen
here.
what
we
have
is
the
state
of
florida
coming
up
23
years
after
a
guilty
plea
not
because
to
defend...
once
again,
it's
judgment.
it's
conviction
not
because
of
anything
they
did
in
the
conduct
of
the
trial,
not
because
the
guy
claims
to
be
actually
innocent,
but
because
almost
2
decades
after
the
plea,
a
federal
court
allegedly
made
a
mistake
of
law
that
wasn't
cleared
up
through
the
appellate
process.
that's
not
the
point
of
federal
habeas
corpus.
that's
not
what
it's
supposed
to
be
about.
but
if
we
open
the
door,
if
we
let
the
camel's
nose
in
the
tent,
a
camel
is
going
to
come
behind
it,
and
it's
going
to
be
procedural
default,
non-retroactivity
of
teague,
and
all
of
the
multiple
other
grounds
on
which
federal
habeas
decisions
are
made
by
courts.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
did...
did
the
florida
make
a
mistake
of
what--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no.
i
guess...
i
think
this
court
is
going
to
tell
us.
i
think
the...
the
pace
v.
diguglielmo
case
that
this
court
heard...
i
think
it
was
last
month--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
my...
the
order
from
the
court,
my
understanding,
simply
denied
it
on
the
grounds
of
legal
insufficiency,
and
it
didn't
give
a
further
explanation.
it
doesn't
say
what
exact
grounds
was,
but
if
you
look
to
what
was
argued
by
florida,
they
were
arguing
on
timeliness.
thank
you.
