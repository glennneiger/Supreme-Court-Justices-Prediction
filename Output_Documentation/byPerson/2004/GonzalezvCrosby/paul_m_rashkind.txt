mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
confront
today
the
eleventh
circuit's
categorical
and
jurisdictional
prohibition
of
rule
60(b)
in
habeas
corpus
cases
absent
fraud.
that
is
a
rule
that
has
been
rejected
by
nearly
all
of
the
other
circuits
and,
in
fact,
has
been
rejected
by
the
united
states
in
its
amicus
brief
filed
in
this
case.
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt
instead
the
approach
of
the
other
nine
circuits
that
have
commented
on
this
issue,
the
functional
approach,
in
which
a
court
is
deemed
to
examine
each
motion
individually
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
motion
comports
with
both
rule
60(b)
and
aedpa.
i
think
the
test
we
proposed
here
is
a
fairly
simple
one,
although
i'm
not
sure
in
the
briefing
it
comes
across
as
being
as
simple
as
it
really
is,
but
the
test
we
are
proposing,
as
opposed
to
the
test
proposed
by
the
united
states,
is
the
one
being
used
in
nearly
all
of
the
other
circuits
and
it
has
percolated
through
the
system
as
one
that
seems
to
work
very
well.
it's
a
two-part
test
and
it's
very
simple
i
think.
first,
does
the
motion
that's
filed
challenge
the
federal
judgment
on
a
ground
cognizable
under
one
of
the
six
prongs
of
rule
60(b)?
if
not,
if
it's
really
a
new
claim,
if
it
is
not
within
one
of
the
six
prongs
of
rule
60(b),
then
simply
the
district
court
denies
it.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
motion
is
a
true
60(b)
motion,
as
ours
was
in
this
case,
then
the
court
goes
to
step
two,
which
is
to
examine
which
is
the
six
prongs
is
implicated,
what
is
the
jurisprudence
regarding
the
six...
that
particular
prong,
and
how
would
it
apply
in
this
particular
case.
that's
the
functional
approach
that
most
of
the
circuits
have
been
using.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
it
does
not
but...
but
point
six
has
been
cabined
by
jurisprudence.
although
point
six
appears
to
be
a
wide-open
door
for
any
motion
to
be
filed
and
granted,
the
courts,
even
before
aedpa,
have
treated
category
six
as
one
that
requires
extraordinary
circumstances.
we
have
been
able
to
quantify.
both
an
amicus
who
filed
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
the
united
states
and
the
respondent
have
quantified
the
number
of
cases
that
have
gone
through
the
rule
60(b)
process.
there
have
only
been,
since
aedpa
was
passed,
28
successful
motions
that
we
can
quantify,
that
are
published
in
any
way.
and
we
would
like
to
think,
at
least,
that
if
the
state
or
the
federal
government
thought
there
was
an
inappropriate
application,
it
would
have
been
raised
on
appeal
and
we'd
have
that
statistic.
28
in
the
9-year
history
of
the
statute
means
fewer
than
3
per
year...
or
slightly
more
than
3
per
year
for
the
whole
country,
a
fraction
for
circuits.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
i
do
not.
and
i
do
not
because
at
this
point
apparently
nine
circuits
are
following
the
rule
we
propose,
and
so
the
statistics
that
both
the
respondent
that
we
bring
to
you
are
that
small,
are
that
infinitesimal
because
the
courts
have
always
treated
60(b)
as
a
last
ditch,
extraordinary
circumstances
required.
one
can
go
through
each
of
the
six
prongs
and
easily
hypothesize
examples
that
are
appropriate,
(b)(1),
(b)(2)--
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
--the
court
in
the
ackermann
decision...
there
were
two
early
decisions
construing
60(b).
the
first
was
the
klapprott
decision
in
which
the
court
recognized
that
60(b)
is
intended
to
correct
the
kind
of
errors
that
might
occur
that
are
important.
the
ackermann
decision
followed
a
year
later
and
said,
however,
this
is
not
a
wide-open
door.
extraordinary
circumstances
are
required.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
it
is
but
it
isn't.
it's
vague
in
terms
of
reading
the
simple
rule,
but
it's
not
vague
if
one
considers
the
jurisprudence
that
surrounds
the
rule.
one
cannot
ignore
a
half-century
of...
of
decisions,
which
have
rejected
60(b)(6)
and
other
60(b)--
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
--well,
i
would--
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
--i
would
prefer
to
rely
upon
the
court's
principles
in
this
regard.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
rhines...
rhines
v.
weber
is
of
good
help
here.
rhines
v.
weber,
that
the
court
delivered
just
very
recently,
considered
the
interaction
of
a
rule
and
of
aedpa,
and
i
thought
it
very
clearly
set
forth
three
principles
which
work
well
within
the
test
here.
first,
that
there
has
to
be
good
cause
and
good
cause,
of
course,
is
clear
in
the
jurisprudence
here,
that
we're
talking
about
extraordinary
circumstances,
not
a
simple
legal
error.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
extraordinary
circumstance
is
that,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
my
client
has
been
denied
his
first
petition
of
right
because
the
court
foreclosed
the
issues
erroneously.
so
good
cause
is
the
first
thing
that
i
learned
from
rhines.
secondly,
that
there
have
to
be
potentially
meritorious
underlying
issues.
now,
that's
going
to
filter
out
a
lot
of
the
cases
because
you
can't
come
into
court
with
another
issue
that
might
not
be
good,
it
mightn't
be
an
unexhausted
issue,
it
might
be--
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
--one
procedurally
defaulted.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
well,
it
is...
it
is
the
terminology
used
in
rhines.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
do
here
for
the
court
is
to
draw
upon
your
own
authority,
the
words
you've
spoken,
as
opposed
to
the
test
proposed
by
the
criminal
justice
foundation
and
by
the
united
states,
which
are
interesting
tests
but
in
no
way
depend
upon
the
court's
own
jurisprudence.
i'm
trying
to
offer
the
court
its
own
tests
that
have
worked.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
and
i
think
that's
why
this
test
works.
the
third
point
would
be
that
there
be
timeliness.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
we
are.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
it
really
isn't
as
pedestrian
as
it
may
have
seemed.
we
underwent
a
change
in
the
law,
in
aedpa,
that
the
court
has
recognized
is
not
fully
clear.
and
so
this
was
one
provision
the
court
had
to
clarify
in
artuz
v.
bennett,
and
there
was
a
very
small
number
of
cases.
i
think
we
totaled
eight
in
which
relief
was
granted
because
district
courts
had
incorrectly
barred
a
petitioner
from
the
first
petition
because
it
really
wasn't
a
violation
of...
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
well,
it
wasn't
a
2-year
statute
of
limitations,
your
honor.
in
fact,
it
was
slightly
different
from
the
federal
statute
of
limitations
as
well.
there
is
a
provision
that
allows
for
newly
discovered
evidence
to
bypass
the
standard
2-year
statute
of
limitations,
which
by
the
way,
the
florida
statute
of
limitations
wasn't
even
adopted
until
well
after
my
client
was
convicted.
as
you
know,
he
says
that
he
was
told
at
his
sentencing
proceeding,
you'll
serve
13
years,
thereabouts,
on
a
99-year
sentence,
and
that
induced
his
plea
of
guilty
in
this
case.
and
when
13
years
came
about,
he
inquired
what's
happening
and
they
said,
no,
that's
not
going
to
happen.
you
have
a
release
date
of
2057.
and
as
i
think
the
court
knows
from
its
decision
in
linz
v.
mathis,
florida...
florida
statutes
really
changed
in
that
way.
gain
time
was
reduced
gradually
and
then
much
more
quickly
so
that
someone
who
might
have
served
13
years
in
1982
is
really
looking
at
serving
the
99.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
to
be
clear...
and...
and
i
want
to
be
clear
about
his
allegation
is...
because
he
does
not
speak
english...
that
the
interpreter
told
him
this,
and
this
was
not
during
a
plea
colloquy.
this
was
during
discussions
between
the
lawyer
and
the
client
through
an
interpreter
in
advance
of
the
plea
itself.
and
so
his
allegation
has
consistently
been
that
that's
what
the
interpreter
told
him
his
lawyer
said.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
no.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
correct.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
correct.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
and
it's
never
been.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
it
is
because
that's
the
way
the
court
has
treated
it.
the
court
has
always--
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
--in
a
different
sense
i'm
saying
it.
in
terms
of
computing
whether
a
time
bar
is
on
the
merits,
the
court
has
not
used
that
concept,
which
does
relate
to
some
sort
of
civil
proceedings.
plaut
would
make
it
appear
first
to
money
judgment
type
cases.
but
the
court
has
not
used
that
standard,
for
example,
in
martinez-villareal,
has
not
used
it
in
slack
v.
mcdaniel.
instead,
the
court
has
not
looked
at
the
nomenclature
of
the
order
that
dismissed
the
case
or
denied
this
case.
instead,
the
court
looks
to
did
the...
the
court
below
address
the
claims
of
the
petitioner.
and
of
course,
a
claim
of
statute
of
limitations
is
not
a
claim
of
a
petitioner.
that's
an
affirmative
defense
of
the
state.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
that's
right.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
i
do
make
that
argument,
and
to
the
extent...
and...
and
i
make
that
argument,
but
that
argument
was
rejected
in
the
court
below
which
addressed
it
with
a
completely
different
approach.
and
so
i
begin
in
this
court
by
having
to
address
where
i
was
in
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
correct.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
in
the
federal
court,
the
district
judge
said
that
the
tolling
provision
would
not
apply
here
because
it
was
the
district
court's
determination
that
it
was
untimely
when
filed
in
the
state
court.
that
was
not,
however,
the
position
of
the
florida
courts.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
and
it
is
not
clear.
i
wish
it
were
because
that's
precisely
what
my
pro
se
client
wrote
in
his
rule
60(b)
motion.
he
said
i
have
been
denied
my
right
to
a
first
petition
because
of
an
incorrect
determination
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
that
the
artuz
decision
makes
clear
that
i
was
entitled
to
a
tolling
period
that
i
was
not
awarded,
and
i
would
like
judgment
modified
or
reopened.
and
that's
as
clear
as
a
pro
se
litigant
can
make
that
claim.
that's
what
the
claim
has
been
from
the
very
beginning,
long
before
i
was
ever
counsel.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
no
indication
of
dilatory
tactics
by
the
plaintiff.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
and
this
is
very
helpful
i
think
because
it
gives
those
three
rules,
which
the
court
has
given
us
in
rhines,
helped
us
and
helped
the
district
court
to
sort
out
the
things
that
shouldn't
be
stopping
or
reopening
proceedings.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
well,
i
actually
argued
and
i
do
believe
that
it
shouldn't
require
a
coa.
and
the
reason
is
because...
part
of
the
reason
is
because
this
case
began
before
slack
v.
mcdaniel
and
continued
after.
and
i
think
that's
where
judge
tjoflat's
opinion
came
from.
how
can
someone
whose
case
is
dismissed
procedurally
ever
get
a
coa?
it's
impossible
because
there's
never
going
to
be
a
constitutional
issue.
by
virtue
of
the
procedural
ruling,
the
constitutional
was
not
addressed.
and
judge
tjoflat
continued
that
dissenting
position
through
the
en
banc
decision,
and
i
share
the
view
that
it
is
virtually
impossible,
if
not
completely
impossible,
in
the
typical
case
of
a
procedural
resolution
of
the
case,
to
ever
get
a
coa.
in
this
case,
the
majority
would
point
to
the
fact
the
my
client
did
receive
a
certificate
of
appealability,
but
i
don't
think
there
are
many
others
who
will
every
get
it
because
the
question
presented
was,
is
a
rule
60(b)
still
viable
post
aedpa?
and
that
question
won't
recur,
certainly
not
after
the
court
rules
here.
and
i
think
the
very
genuine
concern
that
judge
tjoflat
had
was
and
that
he...
that
he
articulated
is
it's
virtually
impossible
to
get
appellate
review.
one
of
the
things
we
know
about
habeas
corpus
is--
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
--correct.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
it
is
for
this
reason,
mr.
chief
justice.
before,
you
could
file
successive
applications.
in
the
early
days
of
habeas
corpus,
you
could
file
successive
applications.
and
the
reason
given
was
there
was
no
appeal.
and
so
you
could
go
from
one
judge
to
the
next
judge
because
there
were
no
appeals.
then,
of
course,
we
had
appeals,
and
the
reason
for
having
successive
petitions
would
diminish.
but
what
has
happened
to
the
appeal
in
a
habeas
corpus
case
is
it
has
become
so
constrained
that
in
many
respects
it
doesn't
exist,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
here's
my
client
who
faces
a
situation
in
which
he
has
clearly
been
thrown
out
of
court
improperly,
and
he
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
that
decision
reviewed
and
can't
get
past
the
gateway
of
the
certificate
of
appealability.
and
so
he
has
no
opportunity
to
really
have
an
appellate
review.
he
has
none.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
i
don't
think
congress
did
intend
that.
when
we
looked--
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
--if
it
is
time--
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
--well,
that's
one
of
the
ways
in
which
a
case
could
be
dismissed
procedurally,
but
it's
not
time-barred
if
the
court
rules
it
was
erroneously.
and
that's
the
concern
that
i
think
my
client
has
here.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
one
of
the
nice
things
about
rule
60(b)
is
it
really
is
a
disciplined
approach
to
a
court
examining
its
own
mistakes.
it
isn't
a
wide-open
door
in
any
respect.
it
is
a
disciplined
approach.
there
are
six
specific
grounds,
and
even
though
the
sixth
one
looks
like
it's
wide-open,
it
certainly
isn't
under
the
jurisprudence
of
the
court.
and
so
what
this
does
is
provide
a
very
important
opportunity
for
a
judge
to
be
able
to
look
at
an
intervening
decision
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
say,
i
have
denied
this
person
what
congress
wanted
them
to
have.
there's
no
question.
one
reads
aedpa
and
one
thing
is
very
clear.
they...
congress
intended
for
a
person
who
has
exhausted
claims,
not
procedurally
defaulted
them
in
state
court,
and
has
filed
a
timely
petition,
that
person
under
2254
is
entitled
to
have
the
claim
entertained.
and
when
a
court
makes
a
mistake,
a
procedural
mistake,
that
forgoes
or
eliminates
the
opportunity
for
review,
and
that
fairly
reviewable
on
appeal,
depending
on
how
the
certificate
of
appealability
may
be
phrased...
and
often
these
folks
are
pro
se...
i
think
what
happens
is
2254
has
failed
and
what
congress
intended
to
happen
isn't
going
to
happen.
the
person
was
entitled
to
one
petition,
one
bite
at
the
apple
and
never
receives
that
bite
at
the
apple.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
i
will.
with
due
deference
to
my
colleagues,
it's
177
words
long,
over
two
pages.
and
that's
why
i
thought
that
the
approach
that
we
brought
to
the
court
from
the
other
nine
circuits
is
a
simpler...
what
i
would
call
a
simple
two-step.
their
approach
actually
can
be
read,
as
we
did
in
our
reply
brief,
to
fit
within
our
own
rule,
but
i
think
the
problem
with
the
government's
rule
is
it
is
so
broad
and
it
does
not
rely
upon
any
of
the
court's
precedents
in...
in
its
writing.
and
so
what
you
do,
if
you
adopt
a
rule
like
that,
first
of
all,
is
create
confusion.
and
secondly,
what
you
do
is
you
make
a
whole
new
set
of
rules
that
are
separate
and
apart
from
what
you...
the
court
has
previously
done
in
its
aedpa
jurisprudence.
to
be
able
to
touch
upon
slack
v.
mcdaniel,
to
be
able
to
draw
upon
martinez-villareal,
to
be
able
to
take
from
rhines
v.
weber,
create
a
formula
and
a
package
that's
familiar
to
the
courts,
to
take
a
rule
that's
177
words
long
that
the
government
puts
together
that
i
interpret
as
being
favorable
to
my
client
and
they
interpret
as
being
unfavorable
to
my
client,
i
think
just
puts
the
kind
of
difficulty
in
the
courts
that
this
case
should
try
to
avoid.
so
my
comment
on
it
is
that
it
may
well,
if
it's
read
as
we
did
in
our
reply
brief,
be
the
same
thing
that
we're
saying
and
what
i
refer
to
as
a
simple
two-step
test.
and
if
not,
it's
just
going
to
be
a
source
of
great
confusion.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
i
think
it's
very
important
to
realize
that
both
rule
81
of
the
federal
rules
of
federal
procedure
and
rule
11
of
the
rules
of
habeas
procedure,
which
the
state
would
have
us
use
as
a
constraint,
really
are
the
first
things
that
tell
us
that
there's
supposed
to
be
a
functional
approach.
both
of
those
rules
tell
us
that
the
rules
apply
to
the
extent
that
they're
compatible,
and
so
that's
certainly
not
a
categorical
approach.
that
is
a
functional
approach.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
new
legal...
this
is
the
part
that
i
think
we
have
to
look
both
at
60(b)
and
the
statute.
new
claims...
new
claims...
are
brought
under
2244(b)(2).
same
claims
are
either
going
to
be
barred
by
(b)(1)
or,
if
heard
at
all,
under
60(b).
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
well,
i
think
that
they're--
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
--well,
i
don't
think
it
does,
but
they
do.
so
that
troubles
me.
[laughter]
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
they
make
an
argument
that
under
their
test,
my
client
should
not
prevail.
i
can
make
an
argument
under
our
test
my
client
prevails.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
i
think
the
heart
of
the
government's
position
is
it
requires
a
much
more
radical
departure
from
general
procedure
than
a
simple
change
of
law.
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
simple
change
of
law,
for
example,
when
it
is
an
intervening
decision
that
interprets
a
statute
that
was
in
effect
and
that
the
mistake
of
not
interpreting
correctly
is
to
effectively
bar
the
first
bite
at
the
habeas
apple.
now,
the
government
does
not
give
that
ground
in
their
test,
and
i
think
it's
important
that
the
court
leave
that
door
open.
and
that's
why
i
think
our
test
is
better
and
theirs
in
inadequate.
i
think
ultimately
we
come
down
to
three
issues
that
support
the
position
that
we're
taking.
chief
judge
edmonson
made
note
of
this
in
his
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion.
he
was
troubled
that
we
were
not
giving
effect
to
both
laws
that
congress
had
approved,
60(b)
and
aedpa.
by
virtue
of
the
majority
rule,
60(b)
had
been
categorically
eliminated.
and
i
think
the
position
we
take
before
the
court
today
is
that
the
court
should
honor
both
provisions
that
congress
has
adopted.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
thank
you.
mr.
paul
m.
rashkind
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
i
may
begin
by
correcting
what
i
think
are
two
inadvertent
mistakes,
but
important
ones.
justice
ginsburg,
in
answer
to
your
question
about
the
first
state
habeas,
these
are...
these
documents
are
contained
in...
in
your
record.
they're
noted
at
joint
appendix
2-5.
the
first
state
habeas
was
dismissed
because
it
was
not
notarized.
that's
the
sole
basis
for
its
dismissal:
it
was
not
notarized.
the
second
one
was
brought
and
denied,
and
the
court
specifically
notes,
as
we
note
in
the
yellow
brief,
footnote
7
on
page
12,
it
set
forth
the...
the
court's
grounds.
it
says
the
motion
does
not
state
grounds
for
relief.
at
no
point
does
florida
ever
adopt
the
state's
position
that
either
of
the
petitions
was
untimely.
the
state
court
addressed
them
directly
on
the
merits.
justice
breyer,
if
i
may,
i
can
actually
hypothesize
several
examples
under
subsection
(5),
of
subsection
(4),
and
perhaps
even
subsection
(2)
of
rule
60(b),
which
would
be
permissible.
for
example,
under
(5),
a
judgment
that
should
no
longer
have
continuing
effect
might
be
that
the
district
court
entered
an
alternative
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
tried
the
defendant
within
60
days
or
90
days,
or
set
him
free.
and
when
everyone
gets
back
to
state
court,
it
becomes
plainly
apparent
that
can't
be
done
within
60
days,
and
either
the
state
or
the
defendant
might
go
back
and
say,
please,
amend
that
order
out
of
time.
it's
a
final
order.
please
amend
it
to
make
it
180
days.
we
can
come
up
with
examples,
i
think,
for
each
of
the
provisions,
and
i
think
that's
really
what's
interesting
about
this
rule.
it
is
written
in
a
way
that's
durable
against
aedpa,
and
it
conforms
nicely
with
aedpa.
and
it
does
not
take
a
lot
of
extra
thought,
it
does
not
take
a
lot
more
than
adopting
the
court's
previous
holdings
for
us
to
be
able
to
make
it
workable
within
aedpa.
the
fact
that
this
case
is
now
in
its
25th
year
is
a
result
of
law
and
not
of
delay.
mr.
gonzalez
alleges...
and
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
say
otherwise
because
we've
never
had
a
hearing...
that
it
took
him
13
years
to
find
out
about
the
newly
discovered
evidence.
he
exhausted
his
claims
for
4
years.
he
was
only
in
federal
court
for
1
year
before
the
state
raised
a
bar,
a
statute
of
limitations
bar,
which
turns
out
to
be
incorrect.
in
the
last
7
years,
there's
been
litigation
both
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
now
before
this
court
caused
by
the
state's
argument
that
the
case
should
have
been
dismissed
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
my
client
is
not
responsible
for
the
fact
that
it's
the
25th
year,
but
what
we
do
know
about
this
case
is
he
has
approximately
76
years
remaining
on
his
99-year
sentence.
and
unless
he
gets
one
bite
at
the
habeas
apple,
he
has
not
gotten
what
congress
directed
he
receive.
congress
made
one
thing
clear
in
aedpa,
and
i
think
it's
a
good
thing,
and
that
is,
if
a
defendant
goes
through
and
does
what
he's
supposed
to
do
in
state
court,
he
does
not
procedurally
default
the
issues,
he
exhausts
fully,
and
he
timely
files
a
petition,
that
was
the
candidate
congress
wanted
to
have
to
get
habeas
review.
in
this
case
aurelio
gonzalez
did
all
of
those
things,
and
he
sits
on
the
outside,
having
been
told
you
get
no
bite
at
the
apple,
it's
too
late.
and
that's
just
plain
wrong.
and
there's
something
wrong
about
that,
and
that's
why
there's
rule
60(b).
60(b)
is
nothing
but
a
coalescence
of
many
great
writs
that
were
designed
for
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
alone
and
that
was
to
correct
mistakes
in
extraordinary
circumstances.
there
can
be
no
more
extraordinary
circumstance
than
that
a
person
is
denied
their
right
to
habeas
review,
and
that's
what's
happened
here.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
rule
60(b)
is
the
only
and
best
tool
to
remedy
the
error
made
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court,
and
we
ask
for
that
result.
thank
you.
