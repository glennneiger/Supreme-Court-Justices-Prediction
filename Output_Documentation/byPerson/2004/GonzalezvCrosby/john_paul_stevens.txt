justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
may
be
a
little
bit
collateral?
there
was
disagreement
on
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
remember
it,
as
to
whether
or
not
a
coa
requirement
applies
to
a
denial
of
a
60(b)
motion.
what
is
your
view
on
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
have
we
seen
it
in
the...
there
are
other
circuits
who
do
adopt
that
rule,
aren't
there?
and
have
we
seen
the
abuse
you're
describing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
was
not
the
applicable
law
at
the
time.
the
decision
related
back
to
before
that
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
sometimes
there
are
law
changing
decisions,
but
this
was
not
a
law-changing
decision.
it's
a
decision
interpreting
what
the
law
was
from
the
date
of
its
enactment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
correct
that
they
address
the
same
subject
matter?
isn't
60(b)
directed
at
the
integrity
of
the
habeas
proceeding,
whereas
aedpa
is
directed
at
the
integrity
of
the
original
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
statement
of
when
it's
not
available?
i
want
to
be
sure
i...
are
you
stating
it
positively
or
negatively?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
available
in
the
circumstance
you
described.
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
would
you
state...
tell
us
when
it
is
available?
