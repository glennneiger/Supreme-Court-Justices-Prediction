justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
that
is
true,
but
i
think
that
the
court
below
and
the
other
parties
say...
almost
everybody
is
on
your
side.
however,
they
also
note
a
problem,
and
the
problem
is
that
given
the
very
rigid
structure
of
aedpa
and
the
imagination
of
lawyers,
that
if
60(b)
hasn't
proved
an
escape
hatch
for
getting
around
the
aedpa
restriction,
it
will,
and
that
what
the
lawyers
will
do
is
they
will
reconstruct
what
they'd
like
as
a
second
habeas
and
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
60(b).
and
so
i
can
accept
everything
you
say,
but
if
that
in
the
back
of
my
mind
is
a
concern
running
around
congress
in
this
way,
what
form
of
words
could
you
put
in
to
restrict
60(b)
to
its
domain
which
is
the
domain
in
which
it's
been
used
so
far?
now,
the
criminal
justice
legal
foundation
filed
a
brief
in
which
they
tried
to
do
that.
i
thought
that
was
a
constructive
effort.
so
what's
your
opinion--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--about
how
best
to
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you...
you
had
a
question.
remember
my...
you
were
giving
me
the
three
principles
to
prevent
the
end
run.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
first
was
good
cause.
the
second
was
potentially
meritorious
underlying
issues,
and
the
third
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the...
the
government,
by
the
way,
seems
a
broader
rule
than
yours.
the
only
thing
it
rules
out
is
new
legal
claims
or
new
evidence.
i
don't
see
anything
in
your...
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
don't
see
anywhere
where
you
say
we
should
be
able
to
bring
a
60(b)
motion
based
on
new
legal
claims
or
new
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
said.
i
don't
see
how
the
government
hurts
you.
i
think...
i
think
if
you
the
government's,
you're
even
better
off.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it's
even...
but
i
want
to
know
why...
why...
there's
some
reason
you
don't
like
the
government,
and...
and...
other
than
fact
that
they
must
hurt
you
in
some
way.
i
don't
see
how
it
hurts
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--make
us--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
under
their
test
too,
you
say
it's
applying
the
same
rule
of...
it's
not
a
new
claim.
it's
the
same
claim
as...
as...
just
that
they...
shows
that
the
district
judge
got
it
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
also
true
of
(b)(3).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
not
even
the
eleventh
circuit
said
(b)(3).
and
therefore,
you
want
to
say
absolute,
or
are
we
really
talking
about
which
60(b)
motions
escape
the
strictures
of
aedpa?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
prepared
to
defend
the...
the
eleventh
circuit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct,
though
you're
alone
on
that
because
even
the
government
doesn't
and
nor
does
the
criminal
justice.
but
if
you're
prepared
to
defend
them,
i
guess
you'd
say
why
is
it
that
they
will
allow
(b)(3),
fraud
on
the
court
by
the
adverse
party,
to
escape,
but
should
your
own
witness
turn
out
to
have
been
committing
his
own
fraud
for
whatever
set
of
reasons,
you
can't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
under
i
guess
the
government,
you
can
bring
everything
under
60(b).
by
the
way,
if
they
do
bring
a
motion
to
reopen
under
60(b)
because
of
change
of
law,
they're
almost
bound
to
lose.
there
are
hardly
any
cases
which
find
that
an
adequate
ground
under
60(b).
but
they
let
you
do
anything
under
60(b),
i
take
it,
as
long
as
the
claims
presented
do
not...
as
long
as
they
are
not
trying
to
obtain
relief
on
the
basis
of
new
legal
claims
or
new
evidence.
now,
i
just
noticed
there's
another
one
here.
do
not
support
habeas
relief.
maybe
that's
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
explain.
i...
i
thought
when
i
first
read
this,
that
this
was
quite
broad,
but
i
may
not
have
read
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
is
that
also
true
if
his
own
witness
has
committed
the
fraud?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
all
i'm
saying
is
exactly
whatever
criteria
is
met,
but
it
happens
to
be
his
own
witness,
and
sometimes
your
own
witnesses
do
have
their
little
games,
you
know,
with
prisoners,
and
so
it's
the
same
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that
not
count
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
page
24,
i
read
the
or
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's...
you
meant
the
things
on
both
sides
of
the
or.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
was
thinking
the
first
side
you'd
allow,
the
second
side
you
wouldn't.
but
if
it's
very,
very
strict,
which
now
i
understand
it,
because
i
read
the
or
correctly
when
i
went
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
would
be
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
now
you're
into...
i
mean,
you
can
use
a
tone
of
voice.
you
know,
it
sounds
very
strong.
but
i
thought
60(b)(6)
is
weird
things
happen,
and
60(b)(1)
is
there
are
all
kinds
of
mistakes.
you
know,
some
of
them
can
just
be
accidental.
the
lawyer
was
hit
by
a
trolley.
and
in
fact,
all
of
60(b)
is
meant
to
capture
that
kind
of
thing.
so
it
sounds
like
what
you're
saying
is,
sure,
follow
60(b),
maybe
not
the
evidentiary,
maybe
not
the
new
evidence
part,
follow
it,
but
be
sure
you
do
so
strictly.
are
you
saying
more
than
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
artuz
had
been
decided
and
it
was
in
the
mail
and
the
judge
forgot
to
open
his
advance
sheets
that
day.
and
so
he
goes
back
to
his
office,
says,
oh,
my
god.
you
know,
i
mean,
a
weird
thing
like
that.
and
of
course,
he
says
nobody
has
been
hurt
yet.
i'll
reopen
it.
okay?
is
that
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
10
days
and
a
half.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
that
it's
happened
is
because
all
the
lawyers
were
hit
by
four
trolleys.
[laughter]
i
mean,
you
see
what
i'm
doing?
i'm
simply
trying
to
find
cases
that
fit
within
the
language,
but
they're
very
weird
and
justice
cries
out
for
a
reopening.
now,
that's
what
it
seems
to
me
one
is
about.
two
is
about.
three
doesn't
really.
three
you
agree
applies.
two
may
not
apply.
four
i
think
you
probably
agree
applies
or
not
at
all.
five
doesn't
apply
at
all,
and
six
is
anything
under
the
sun.
