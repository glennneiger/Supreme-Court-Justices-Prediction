mr.
christopher
m.
kise
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
fundamental
inconsistency
to
this
court.
congress
said
through
aedpa
that
a
habeas
petitioner
is
to
take
all
their
claims,
put
them
in
one
basket,
bring
them
to
court
within
1
year,
and
a
sovereign
state
is
going
to
defend
that
judgment
in
federal
court
one
time.
rule
60(b)
says,
petitioner,
use
as
many
baskets
as
you
need,
take
as
long
as
you
like,
and
the
state,
you're
going
to
have
to
keep
coming
back
over
and
over
and
over
again.
and
this
case
here
presents
that...
that
very
problem.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
well,
respectfully,
justice
ginsburg,
i...
i
would
disagree
with
that
in
this
sense.
i
would
disagree
with
it
in
the
sense
that
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
if
this
court
were
to
open
that
door,
i
think
you
would
see
that
sort
of
abuse.
i
think
you
would
see
that
sort
of
manipulation
of
the
process.
i
think
you
would
see
that
sort
of--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--we
have
not
yet,
but
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
that
is
because
there
is
still
this
uncertainty
because
this
case
is
here
before
this
court,
and...
and
because
this
has
not
yet
been
approved.
if
this
is
approved
by
this
court,
then
you're
going
to
see
sovereign
states
like
florida
dragged
back
in
here
nearly
25
years
later--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
in...
in
the
ordinary
civil
context,
that's
perhaps
correct,
your
honor,
but...
but
this
isn't
the
ordinary
civil
context.
this
is
the
habeas
context.
and
congress
has
said
that
this
is
the
structure
that
we
want
to
take.
this
is
the
rule
that
we
want
to
take.
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
that...
that
aedpa
was
passed
with...
with
this
enduring
respect
for
finality,
this
respect
for
the
sovereignty
of
states.
state,
you're
only
going
to
have
to
come
back
here
one
time.
you're
only
supposed
to
litigate
one
time,
one...
all
the
claims
in
one
basket.
they're
brought
within
1
year,
and
the
state
is
to
defend
its
judgment
one
time
because--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
your
honor,
again,
there...
there
has
to
be
some
finality
to
the
process,
and...
and
here
what
the
petitioner
got
was
at
the
time
a
perceptively
correct
view
of
the
law.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
2
years
after
the
district
judge
made
his
ruling
in
this
particular
case.
and
it...
it
was
in
this
particular
case
2
years.
it
could
be
10
years.
it
could
be
15
years,
and
that's
the
problem
that
we
see
is
that
if--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
your
honor,
it's
not
exaggerated
when
you
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
that...
that
congress
intended
us
to
be
in
court
one
time
to
defend
this
judgment
in
federal
court.
we
were
there.
he
received
a--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
he
received
a...
a
final
disposition
on
the
non-technical
procedural
basis
which
was
the
applicable
law
at
the
time.
he
received
that
adjudication
and--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
your
honor,
then
that
would,
respectfully,
eviscerate
any...
any
notion
of...
of
the
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--but
based
on
that,
your
honor,
then
there
would
be
no
statute
of
limitations.
if...
if
that
decision
came
out
10
years
from
now,
we
would
then
be
back
in
this
court
on
a
60(b)
motion,
which
i
would
submit
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
what
congress
intended.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
at
the
same
time,
there
may
be
some
other
mistake
or
some
other
excusable
neglect
or
some
other
issue
that
comes
up.
i
mean,
what
congress
intended
to
prevent
is
not
just
the
successful
filing
of
a
60(b)
or
the
successful
revisiting,
if
you
will,
of
the
judgment.
it...
it
intended
to
prevent
the
actual
attempt
itself.
i
mean,
the
idea
is...
is
that
once
this
judgment
is
adjudicated,
once
we've
had
this
adjudication,
you
are
not
to
come
back.
you
are
not
to--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--but
i
would...
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
your
honor's
premise
that...
that
he...
he's
not
seeking
to
revisit
an
adjudicated
petition.
he
did...
he
is
seeking,
as...
as
we
see
it,
to--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--and
we
would
submit
that
it
is
second
and
successive
because
it's
seeking
to
revisit
that
adjudication,
an
adjudication
that
was
had
on
a
non
technical
procedural
basis.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
but...
but
the
congress
intended
to
take
that
discretion
away
from
the
district
courts.
2244(b)(1)
says
you
will
not
look
at
it
again,
and
2244(b)(3)
says,
in
fact,
that
when
you
do
go
back
to
potentially
revisit
an
issue,
when
you
do
go
back
to
potentially
look
at
a
second
or
successive,
that
it's
not
even
the
same
district
judge
that
makes
that
determination.
as
in
60(b),
you
go
back
to
the
same
judge.
2244(b)(3)
says,
no,
a
three-judge
panel
of
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
must
first
determine
whether
or
not
you
even
have
a
right
to
get
in--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
i...
i
think
we're
talking
about
which
60(b)(3)
motions...
or
60(b)
motions
do
escape
the
strictures
of
aedpa.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i...
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
well,
i
would...
i
would
say
why
fraud...
to
answer
your
question,
your
honor,
why
fraud...
let
me
back
up
first
to
the
premise
that...
that
our
position
and
the
government's
position
are
not
far
apart.
i
would
respectfully
say
that...
that
we
are
not
that
far
apart.
i
do
not
see
that
much
light
between
the
positions,
although
i
know
their
brief
leaves
some
room--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--perhaps
i--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
and
i
don't
want
to
pretend
to
speak
for
the
united
states
because...
because
that...
that
might
cause
me
to
misspeak.
but
to
answer
your
question
about
why
fraud
is
different,
i...
i
have
three
bases
for
why
fraud
is
different
and
why
we
think
that
that
exception
is
the
right
exception.
one,
this
court
has
said
in
the
past
that
fraud
is
different
than
other
things.
in
the
hazel
case
that's
cited
in
calderon,
this
court
has
said
that
tampering
with
the
administration
of
justice
through
fraud
involves
more
than
an
injury
to
a
single
litigant.
it
is
a
wrong
against
the
very
institutions
designed
to
safeguard
the
public,
institutions
that
cannot
tolerate
fraud.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
well,
i...
i
would...
our
fraud
exception
that...
that
we...
we
are
delineating
here
is
material,
intentional
conduct
that
subverts
the
process.
and
it
can't
be
just
anyone,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
it
needs
to
be
someone
in
a
position
to
subvert
the
process
for...
for
a
purpose
like
the
government
or
the
court
if
you...
if...
a
judge
that's
been
bribed
in
the
unusual
example
of
that,
or...
or
the...
the
subornation
of
perjury
in
the
hazel
sense.
those
examples...
that
would
be
fraud
that
i
think
is
what
this
court
was
talking
about
in
hazel--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
a
witness
for...
a...
a
claim
that
a
witness
for
the
government
perjured
himself
during
the
trial
would
certainly
implicate
material,
intentional
conduct
designed
to
subvert
the
process.
and
one
of
the
advantages
to
using
fraud
is...
is
that
it
is
a
familiar
bright
line,
workable
standard
for
district
courts.
and
with
fraud,
you
have
to
plead
a
little
bit
more
particularly,
and
so
you
would
avoid
in
some
respects
some
of
the
question
marks
that
would
come
up--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
leave
so
much
room
for
mischief,
it
would
not
be
possible
to
contain
the
potential
for...
for
appeals.
i
mean,
if
every
jailhouse
snitch
were...
were
subject
to...
to
the...
the
60(b)
exception
that
we're...
we're
articulating
here,
if
every...
every
petitioner
could
simply
say,
well,
my
own
witness
that
i
put
up
on
the
stand...
that...
that
witness
perjured
himself
or
herself,
then...
then
the
opportunity
for
mischief
would
abound,
and
we
would
be
back
in
the
same
position
that
we
would
be
in
general
with...
with
states
having
to
respond
again.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
no,
your
honor.
we...
we
would
submit
that
it
is
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
that...
that
rule
3.850
provided
the
petitioner
with
2
years
within
which
to
apply,
and
both
of
his
petitions
were
dismissed
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds.
and
i
don't
know
that
that
matters--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--to
the
end
result
here,
but...
but
that...
that's
our
position.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
your
honor
may
be
referring
to
the
second
3.850
dismissal,
and
that
second
3.850
didn't
meet
the
requirements
of
the
successive
rule.
there...
there
was
a
first--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--yes,
your
honor,
and
then
the
second
one
was
also
on
the
statute
of
limitations
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of...
of
the
successive
rule
because
it
was
essentially
the
same
claim
raised
again.
he
raised
the
same
claim
a
second
time.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i'm
not
sure
exactly
where
it
is
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
let
me
see.
i...
i
don't
know
that
we
do.
i
know
we
have
reference
to
it,
but
i
don't
know
that
we
have
the
actual
language.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
it
is...
it
is
in
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
yes.
i
believe...
when
i
said
opinion,
i'm
sorry.
the
eleventh
circuit
record,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
eleventh
circuit
record,
the...
the
decision
of
the
florida
court.
but
it
is
not
in
the
appendix
before
this
court.
but
returning
again
to
justice
breyer,
because
i
don't
think
i
finished
my
three
reasons.
the
first
was
because
this
court
said
and
says
fraud
is
different.
the
second
is
because
there
never
was
a
first
review
in
that
sense.
i
mean,
they
never
obtained
the
first
review
that
they...
they
were
seeking.
and
the
third
is...
is
the
state's
finality
interest,
which
this
court
has...
has
recognized
as...
as
near
paramount
under
certain
circumstances,
must
yield
where
you
have
the
presence
of
fraud.
and...
and
so
that's
why
florida
maintains
that
this
is
the
correct
and...
and
only
exception.
and...
and
there
are
several
reasons
that
we
maintain
that
this
is
the
correct
and
only
exception.
the
first
and...
and
most
important,
and...
and
as
i
started
this
presentation,
is
that
this
is
the
only
exception
that
preserves
congressional
intent.
the
second
is...
is
that
aedpa
and
rule
60(b)
cannot
coexist
except
in
very
narrow
circumstances
because
they
address
the
same
subject
matter
in
fundamentally
different
ways.
and
the
third
is,
as
i
mentioned
before,
because
the
court--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--well,
i...
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
your
honor
because
2244(b)(1)
does
deal
with
the...
the
revisiting
of
the
federal
habeas
petition.
the
2244(b)(1)
specifically
applies
to
the
revisitation
of
the
federal
habeas
petition.
and
in...
in
terms
of
how
they
deal
with
the
same
subject
matter
in
different
ways,
as
i
began,
aedpa's
whole
purpose
is
to
provide
one
basket
of
claims
within
1
year
so
the
state
has
to
defend
one
time,
and
60(b)
allows
for
the
potential...
and...
and
i
would
submit
to
you
more
than
just
the
potential
if
this
court
were
to
approve
a
standard...
for...
for
repetitive
claims,
many
baskets,
many...
many
years,
and...
and
many
times
that
the
state
has
to
come
back.
and
as
i
say,
in
this
case
the...
the
principle
of
finality
is
all
but
abolished
in
this
case
and
all
be
eviscerated
simply
by
the
fact
that
nearly
25
years
later
florida
is
still
in
this
court
defending
this
judgment
that
was
based
on
a
guilty
plea,
not
even
a...
a
conviction.
and...
and
as
this
court
recognized,
albeit
not
as
part
of
the
holding,
but...
but
mentioned
in...
in
calderon
with
respect
to
the
enduring
respect
for
finality,
this
is
something
that
has
survived
both
direct
and
post-conviction
review
in
the
state
court
system.
i
mean,
this
is...
this
is
federal
review
of
a
sovereign
state's
determination
as
to
the
application
of
its
criminal
laws,
and
congress
has
made
a
policy
determination
that...
that
that
federal
review
must
be
limited
because
state...
state
exercise
of
its...
of
its
police
power
and...
and
the
enforcement
of
its
judgments
is
something
that
needs
to
be
respected.
and
congress...
because
the
power
to
grant
habeas
is
given
by
written
law,
congress
has
the
power
to
make
that
policy
determination.
and
while
the
petitioner
argues
that
60(b)
somehow
strikes
a
balance,
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
congress
has
already
struck
that
balance.
congress
has
already
made
that
determination.
there
isn't
another
balance
to
be
struck
by
the
use
of
60(b),
but
that
a
balance
has
already
been
struck
by
congress
and
congress
has
made
a
determination
that
in
most
circumstances
finality
is
going
to
trump.
and
this
isn't
a
perfect
system.
there
are
going
to
be
exceptions
with
any
bright
line
rule.
with
any
bright
line
rule
that
this
court
has
ever
carved
out--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
specifically
rule
out
60(b)--
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
--in...
in
capital
cases.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i
don't
know...
under
the
statute?
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i'm
not
certain.
we...
we're
submitting
that
the
congress
under...
under
aedpa
ruled
out
60(b)
in
all
cases
with
the
exception
of...
of
the
fraud.
mr.
christopher
m.
kise
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
but
with
respect
to
the
bright
line
rule
that...
that
we
submit
is
necessary
to
effectuate
congressional
intent,
as
i
was
saying,
that
it's
not
a
perfect
system.
and
the
petitioner
can
come
up
with
all
manner
of
examples
that...
that
seem
to
implicate
various
policy
determinations
about
what
should
or
should
not
happen
in
a
given
situation.
but...
but
our
position...
and
we
believe
the
position
of
the
eleventh
circuit
is...
is
that
congress
has
already
weighed
that
now.
congress
has
already
made
that
determination.
congress
has
already
told
us
where
the
line
is
going
to
be
drawn
and
it's
going
to
be
drawn
on
the
side
of
finality
and
it's
going
to
be
drawn
on
the
side
of
respect
for
state
sovereignty.
and
i
would...
would
also
submit
that...
that
the
sixth
circuit
test
and
the
functional
equivalent
approach
test
that's
advanced
by
the
petitioner
ignores
really
both
the
statute
and
it
ignores
reality.
it
ignores
the
statute
because
aedpa
tells
us
you
can't
revisit
an
adjudicated
habeas
petition
unless
there
are
certain
limited
circumstances
that
are
met.
and
it
ignores
reality
because
the
only
reason
to
revisit
a
habeas
petition
is
to
ultimately
revisit
the
underlying
state
court
judgment.
and
the
only
purpose
for
being
there
is
to
ultimately
get
at
that
state
court
conviction
that
is...
that
is
under
siege.
with
respect
to
the
coexistence,
the
petitioner
made
a
point
about
this
case
is
somehow
like
the
rhines
case
that
was
decided
recently
by
this
court.
but
in
the
rhines
case,
this
court
was
balancing
the
exhaustion
requirements
with
the
statute
of
limitations
provisions.
here
there's
nothing
to
balance.
here
this
is
just
simply
a
prohibition.
congress
says
you
cannot
revisit
except
in
these
isolated,
limited
circumstances.
and
so
rule
81,
habeas
rule
11,
and
this
court's
decision
in
pitchess
all
say
that
60(b)
does
not
trump
if
the
habeas
statute
holds
differently.
and
finally,
the
courts
do
need
a
bright
line
that's
not
subject
to
variance,
as
i
mentioned
earlier.
this
is
a
workable
standard.
they're
familiar
with
fraud.
it's
well
defined
in
the
case
law.
it
requires
more
particularized
pleading
which
makes
less
room
for
mischief,
and
it...
it
gives
the
courts
an
easily
identifiable
standard
by
which
they
can
effectuate
that
congressional
policy,
that
congressional
policy
of
one
basket
of
claims
within
1
year
and
the
state
will
come
into
this
federal
court
one
time
to
defend
its
sovereign
judgment.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
