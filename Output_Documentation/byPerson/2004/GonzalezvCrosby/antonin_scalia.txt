this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
for
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
it
involves
the
intersection
of
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
or
aedpa
with
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
60(b)
which
allows
civil
litigants
to
seek
relief
from
a
final
judgment.
habeas
corpus
is
a
civil
action.
in
1982,
petitioner,
aurelio
gonzales
pleaded
guilty
in
florida
circuit
court
to
a
robbery
charge.
he
twice
sought
relief
from
that
conviction
in
the
florida
state
courts.
they
denied
both
motions
as
procedurally
barred.
petitioner
then
sought
federal
habeas
corpus
relief.
in
1999,
the
district
court
dismissed
his
petition
as
time
barred
because
he
filed
it
more
than
a
year
after
aedpa’s
statute
of
limitations
took
effect
and
because
the
district
court
thought
that
the
limitations
period
was
not
tolled
while
the
procedurally
barred
motion
was
pending
in
state
court.
the
eleventh
circuit
denied
petitioner
a
certificate
of
appealability
and
he
did
not
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
or
a
petition
for
cert.
some
months
later,
we
held
in
a
case
called
artuz
versus
bennett
that
even
a
procedurally
barred
state
filling
may
toll
aedpa’s
statute
of
limitations.
relying
on
artuz,
petitioner
filed
a
motion
with
the
district
court
seeking
to
reopen
his
habeas
case
under
rule
60(b)
which
permits
relief
from
judgment
in
civil
cases
based
on
grounds
such
as
excusable
and
neglect,
newly
discovered
evidence
or
“any
other
reason
justifying
relief”.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion.
sitting
en
banc,
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed
by
a
vote
of
seven
to
four
and
held
that
except
in
cases
of
fraud,
aedpa
precludes
the
use
of
rule
60(b)
by
habeas
petitioners
and
requires
rule
60(b)
motions
to
be
treated
as
second
or
successive
habeas
petitions
which
are
subject
to
strict
time
limitations
and
other
limitations.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
eleventh
circuit
was
wrong
to
treat
petitioner’s
motion
as
a
successive
habeas
petition
and
that
petitioner’s
motion
was
properly
brought
under
rule
60(b).
we
nonetheless,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
under
rule
60(b),
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
relief.
rule
60(b)
like
the
rest
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
applies
in
habeas
proceedings
only
“to
the
extent
that
it
is
not
inconsistent
with”
applicable
federal
statutory
provisions.
the
relevant
provision
of
aedpa
forbids
a
state
prisoner
from
filing
a
second
or
successive
habeas
corpus
application
except
under
certain
limited
circumstances
and
then
only
if
the
court
of
appeals
precertifies
that
his
petition
meets
one
of
those
narrow
criteria.
rule
60(b)
is
inconsistent
with
this
statute
and
therefore,
inapplicable
if
a
rule
60(b)
motion
is
the
substantive
equivalent
of
a
successive
habeas
application.
under
the
successive
petition
statute,
the
sine
qua
non
of
a
habeas
corpus
application
is
a
claim,
that
is
an
asserted
federal
basis
for
relief
from
a
state
conviction.
if
a
rule
60(b)
motion
seeks
vindication
of
such
a
claim,
it
is
sufficiently
similar
to
a
habeas
corpus
application
that
it
must
be
subject
to
the
requirements
that
apply
to
successive
petitions.
the
motion
here
however,
does
not
present
such
a
claim.
it
merely
alleges
that
the
federal
courts
misapplied
the
federal
statute
of
limitations.
although
a
rule
60(b)
motion
attacking
a
federal
court’s
basis
for
denying
a
habeas
petition
on
the
merits
may
qualify
as
a
successive
habeas
petition,
a
motion
attacking
only
a
non
merits
aspect
of
the
first
federal
habeas
proceeding
may
proceed
under
rule
60(b).
there
is
a
valid
role
for
rule
609b)
in
postconviction
litigation
and
the
rule
is
already
subject
to
limitations
that
reduce
its
friction
with
aedpa.
although,
petitioner’s
motion
is
properly
brought
under
rule
60(b),
it
does
not
present
a
sufficient
basis
to
revisit
the
judgment
denying
habeas
relief.
relief
under
rule
60(b)
perpetual
provision
that
petitioner
invokes
requires
a
showing
of
“extraordinary
circumstances”.
our
resolution
in
artuz
of
a
circuit
split
in
a
question
of
habeas
procedure
under
aedpa
does
not
qualify
as
an
extraordinary
circumstance.
it
is
all
the
less
extraordinary
in
petitioner’s
case
because
he
did
not
diligently
pursue
review
of
the
district
court’s
statute
of
limitations
ruling.
for
these
reasons
and
others
stated
in
our
opinion,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
oponion;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
