justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
that
point
when
the
court
makes
that
examination
under
your
rule
and
it
comes
to
point
six--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--does
it
refer
at
any
point
or
in
any
circumstance
to
aedpa?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask
the
same
question.
it's
about
as
pedestrian
an
issue
as
you
could
get.
it
comes
up
all
the
time.
i
mean,
this
is
not
a
cosmic
legal
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're...
you're
saying
it
is
extraordinary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
had
the
same
comment
or
the
same
reaction
as
justice
ginsburg.
forget
about
the
habeas
area.
just
in...
with
general
civil
judgments,
have
there
been
law
review
articles
saying
that
rule
60(b)
undermines
finality?
people
kept
going
back,
back,
and
back.
i...
i
thought
quite
the
opposite,
that
we
were
living
very
well
with
rule
60(b).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where...
where
do
you
disagree
with
judge
carnes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
with...
with
the
majority
of...
in...
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
