justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
the
first
few
words
of
the
sentence
there
that
you
quoted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
and
so,
they
are
saying
that
they're
wrong
on
their
ground
for
thinking
that
the
language
and
context
don't
embrace
it.
since
they
used
the
wrong
standard,
they
never
got
to
the
question
of
whether
the
evidence
warranted
a
directed
verdict.
so
i
don't
see
how
we
avoid
looking
at
all
of
what
you'd
call
the
atmospherics.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
they
interpreted
the
statute
in
a
particular
way.
isn't
that
right?
i'm
asking.
i'm
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
answer
that
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
say
that
does
not...
the
safe
harbor
does
not
reach,
among
other
things,
back
down
the
chain
of
experimentation
to
embrace
the
development
of
new
drugs
that
will
be
subject
to
fda
approval.
in
your
opinion,
is
that
statement,
as
i
read
it...
i
left
out
the
word
"identification"...
as
i
read
it,
is
that
statement
a
correct
statement
of
the
law,
or
incorrect
statement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
law.
so
then,
i
take
it,
the
other
thinks
that
it
isn't,
because,
for
example,
you
could
have
a
situation
where
you
are
developing
drugs,
and,
in
developing
drugs,
you
do
some
experiments
and
you
get
some
information
that
would
be
useful
to
the
fda
and
the
ind
process,
and,
therefore,
they
are
within
the
safe
harbor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
this
very
dialogue
makes
me
able
to
ask
a
question
that
i
think
will
reveal
better
to
you
what
i
need
an
answer
to.
reading
this,
and
listening
to
the
discussion,
and
your
use
of
the
word
"atmospherics",
suggests
that
the
opinion
below
is
pretty
foggy.
we
have
merck,
the
food
and
drug
administration,
the
government,
the
entire
biotechnology
industry,
the
drug
industry
of
the
united
states,
and
everybody
else
telling
us
that
they
are
wrong
in
the
way
they
stated
the
standard.
and
you,
yourself,
urge
us
to
look
beyond
the
way
they
stated
it.
so,
what's
the
harm,
and
why
wouldn't
we,
given
this
and
the
unclarity,
just
try
to
do
a
better
job
at
stating
the
standard,
say,
"that's
the
standard",
and
then
send
it
back,
and
then
you
can
make
all
your
arguments
there
about
how
it
applies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
important.
they
say
they
want
to
know
the
pharmacological
action
of
the
drug
in
relation
to
its
proposed
therapeutic
indication.
the
reason,
i
take
it,
the
word
"efficacy"
is
not
there
directly
is
because
that
word
has
a
history,
the
kefauver
hearings,
and
it
was
involving
drugs
that
don't
do
anything.
safety
is
a
different
matter.
but
of
course
when
you
consider
whether
something
is
safe,
you
must
know,
since,
for
example,
cancer
drugs
poison
people,
the
extent
to
which
that
poisoning
is
outbalanced
by
its
effect
in
curing
people.
so
how
could
you
possibly,
particularly
where
cancer
is
at
issue,
know
whether
this
is
an
appropriately
safe
drug,
without
knowing
how
effective
it
is,
as
well
as
knowing
the
side
effects
that
are...
that
are
harmful?
if
i
knew
that
there
was
any
answer
to
that
question
at
all,
i
might
be
tempted
to
agree
with
you,
because
it
doesn't
use
the
word.
but
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
we
concluded...
well,
i
don't
want
to
cut
you
off.
go
ahead,
please.
i
cut
you
off.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
the
reason
you
brought
it
up
is
because
the
particular
certificate
that
is
for
a
safety-certified
lab
is
not
applicable
to
the
lab
that
used
this
stuff.
that's
why
you
brought
it
up,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
understand
that.
and
you'd
have
to
conclude,
for
them
to
win...
but
suppose
i
did
conclude...
suppose,
for
hypothetical...
the
sake
of...
for...
as
a
hypothetical,
suppose
i
thought,
yes,
this
does
include
the
safety
part,
looking
at
how
effective
drugs
are,
too.
suppose
i
concluded
that
the
statute
meant
sometimes
you
could
do
that,
in
an
ordinary
laboratory
that
didn't
have
the
special
certificate?
suppose
i
concluded
that,
indeed,
you
could
look
well
in
advance
of
the
clinical
test
period
to
get
the
information
for
the
ind?
and
suppose
i
concluded
that
sometimes,
where
it
was
reasonably
related,
you
could,
in
fact,
look
at
other
drugs,
too,
that
are
related
to
the
ones
you
do.
if
i
concluded
that...
and
i'm
not
saying
i
would...
then
would
you
concede
that
a
directed
verdict
would
have
been
appropriate
against
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
and
what's
your
strongest
argument
that
it
wouldn't?
