mr.
daryl
joseffer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
the
question
before
the
court
is
the
proper
construction
of
the
statute,
and
we
believe
the
lower
courts
committed
three
important
legal
errors
that
should
be
corrected.
the
first
is
in
drawing
the
clinical/preclinical
distinction.
and,
understanding
that,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
important
thing
to
understand
is
that
clinical
studies
refer
to
studies
conducted
on
humans,
and
at
the
ind
stage,
the
whole
question
is
to
decide
whether
studies
should
be
conducted
on
humans.
so
at
that
point
in
time
the
only
information
that's
available
is
the
preclinical
studies
on
animals
and
in
test
tubes.
so
when
the
court
distinguished
between
preclinical
and
clinical,
it
was
essentially
saying,
you
cannot
do
the
information
that's
necessary
to
submit
an
ind,
necessary
to
do
clinical
trials,
necessary
to
get
your
drug
approved.
and
that's
why
we...
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
clearly
wrong.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
yes,
that's
the
purpose
of
an
ind
application,
is...
the
whole...
the
only
thing
that
fda
is
looking
at,
at
that
point,
is
whether
to
permit
human
clinical
trials
to
proceed.
the
second
important
legal
error
committed
by
the
federal
circuit
was
in
apparently
concluding
that
only
tests
regarding
the
compounds
ultimately
submitted
to
fda
in
an
ind
are
subject
to
the
protection.
now,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
a
company
can
decide
which
specific
compound
to
submit
only
by
first
comparing...
doing
studies
on
that
compound
and
on
others
in
order
to
determine
which
would
be
the
best
compound
to
submit,
which
would
strike
the
best
balance
between
obtaining
health
effects
or
reporting
safety
concerns.
so,
if
the
exemption
only--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--the
second
error,
we
believe,
is
that
the
federal
circuit
indicated
that
only
studies
undertaken
on
the
single
compound
ultimately
submitted
in
an
ind
are
protected
by
the
exception.
and
the
problem
with
that
is
that
i
can't
figure
out
what
that
one
compound
is
until
i've
done
studies
on
it
and
on
other
compounds
to
determine--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--which
is
the
best
to
submit.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
we
would...
we
would
look
at
it
this
way.
if
i'm...
say
i
have
12
compounds
that
i'm
going
to
test
and
decide
which
is
best
and
go
forward
with.
at
the
time
i'm
doing
a
test
on
any
one
of
those
compounds,
if
those
tests
succeed,
it's
reasonably
foreseeable
i'll
submit
an
ind
for
that
compound.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
and
the--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
i
think
we
would
disagree
with
that,
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
the
federal
circuit,
as
justice
o'connor
noted,
reserved...
resolved
these
questions
entirely
as
a
matter
of
law,
based
on
a
de
novo
interpretation
of
the
statute,
without
regard
to
the
jury
instruction.
and
that's
the
holding
that's
now
before
this
court.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
we
think
that
it's...
if
it's
construed
correctly,
we
think
that
it's
correct,
but
just
too
general
to
be
of
assistance
to
the
courts
in
addressing
the
more
specific
questions
of
the
issue
here.
and
this
is...
remember,
merck
has
sought
judgement
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
when
a
party
seeks
judgement
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
courts
are
not
constrained
to
only
applying
the
law
that's
found
in
the
jury
instruction;
they
can
also
articulate
and
apply...
and
do
all
the
time...
other
legal
principles
that
are
relevant.
praprotnik
v.
st.
louis
is
a
great
example
of
a
case
where
this
court
did
that.
now,
there
would
be
a
problem
if
the
jury
instruction
was
inconsistent
with
the
correct
rule
of
law,
because
then
there
could
be
a
waiver
concern.
but
we
don't
see
that
at
issue
here,
because
the
jury
instruction,
we
think,
was
just
too
general
to
speak
to
these
issues.
but
getting
back
to
my
point
about
why
it
can't
be
limited
to
that
single
compound--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--we
think
that
the
petitioner
should
not,
and
is
not,
arguing
inconsistently
with
the
jury
instruction.
the
point
is
just
that
juries,
being
lay
people,
tend
to
be
instructed--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--i
think
that's
just
with
the
general
principles.
take,
for
example,
a
negligence
case.
jurors
are
instructed
all
the
time
that
the
defendant
has
a
duty
of
ordinary
care.
and
then
courts,
on
appeal,
will
determine
more
specific
legal
questions,
whether
entire
classes
of
conduct
do
or
do
not
comply
with
the
ordinary
care,
in
much
greater
detailed
instructions
to
the
jury.
and
example
of
a
case
where
this
court
did
that
would
be
shenker
v.
b&o
railroad,
at
374
u.s.
1.
and
we
think
that
in
a...
in
determining
whether
a
petitioner
is
entitled
to
judgement
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
court
should
just
articulate
and
apply
the
specific
legal
principles
here;
they're
not
inconsistent
with
the
jury--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes.
in
fact,
this
court
already
held
in
eli
lilly
v.
medtronic
that
the
statute
is
not
limited
to
generic
drugs.
in
fact,
it's
not
even
limited
to
drugs,
but
also
applies
to
things
like
medical
devices,
food
additives,
color
additives.
and
it's
a
very
important
point,
because
the
federal
circuit
thought
the
statute
to
be
construed
in
an
artificially
narrow
manner
in
light
of
a
supposed
focus
on
generic
drugs,
which
is
just
inconsistent
with
this
court's
authoritative
construction
of--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no,
the
third
is
the
error
committed
by
the
district
court
and
relied
on
by
respondents
here,
which
is
the
statement
that
fda
only
considers
safety,
and
not
efficacy,
in
determining
whether
to
permit
human
clinical
trials
to
proceed.
it's
a
very
important
point,
because
at
the
ind
stage
the
question
for
fda
is
whether
a
drug
should
be
given
to
human
beings.
and
because
there's
no
such
thing
as
an
absolutely
safe
drug,
because
all
drugs
entail
at
least
some
safety
risks,
fda
will
not
let
human
clinical
trials
proceed
unless
there's
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
study
could
be
useful.
it's
a...
it's
a
benefit-risk
analysis.
the
court
looks
to
whether
the
potential
benefits
of
the
test
would
outweigh
the
risks
of
the
test;
and
if
not,
the
court
will
not
let
a
test
proceed.
now,
congress
charged
fda
with
doing
that
by
instructing
fda
to
determine
whether
the
drug
would
pose
an
unreasonable
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
humans.
and
fda
has
construed
that,
as
i
said,
to
mean
the
benefit-risk.
the
most
express
articulation
of
that
comes
in
the
guidance
document
that
fda
has
put
out
regarding
the
preparation
of
the
investigators
brochure,
which
is
a
required
part
of
the
9d
submission.
and
the
investigators...
and
the
guidance
document
explains
that
the
investigators
brochure
must
provide
sufficient
information
for
the...
for
the
reader
to,
quote,
"make
his/her
own
unbiased
risk-benefit
assessment
of
the
proposed
clinical
trial.
"
that's
set
forth
on
the
bottom
of
page
10
of
our
brief.
and
in
order--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--that's
contrary
to
federal
law.
i...
certainly
would
be
severe
civil
consequences.
and
my
guess
is
there
are
criminal
consequences
for
doing
that,
too.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
yes.
we
think
that
the
proper
test
looks
to
whether
a
company
is
trying
to
develop
a
particular
drug,
by
which
we
mean
a
substance
with
particular
characteristics
designed
to
achieve
particular
objectives.
to
explain
that,
we
recognize
that
basic
scientific
research
into
human
biology
and
disease
processes
is
not
protected.
that's
just
too
far
down
the
stream
of
causation.
but
once
i
get
a
particular
concept
for
a
drug,
this
says
i'm
going
to
treat
the
disease
in
a
particular
way
by
targeting
a
particular
part
of
the
disease
process.
then
we
think
that
the
work
done,
going
forward,
with
includes
comparing
different
substances
to
figure
out
which
would
be
the
best
active
ingredient,
is
protected.
to
provide
a
concrete
example--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no.
and
here's
why.
the
basic
insight,
and
then
i'll
explain
it,
is
that
the
first
time
a
study...
a
study
is
run
on
a
particular
substance,
if
that's...
first
study
is
not
protected,
then
the
exemption
is
worthless,
because
i'd
have
to
commit
that
infringing
study
before
i
came
to
the
protection
of
the
exemption.
so,
we
would
say
that
the...
in
this
case,
for
example...
i
think
it's
easier
on
particulars...
that
basic
research
was
figuring
out
that
the
key
to
cancer
is...
the
key
to
the
growth
of
tumors
is
angiogenesis,
and
the
key
to
blocking
angiogenesis
is
blocking
the
alpha
v
beta
3
receptors.
that's
the
basic
research
into
how
the
body
works.
but
once
i
then
start
trying
to
figure
out
which
substance
would
best
block
an
alpha
v
beta
3
receptor,
it's
very
specific,
because
i
know
what
that
receptor
is,
i
know
what
it's
like,
i
know
what
characteristics
i'm
going
to
need
in
a
drug
to
block
that.
and
when
i
try
different
things
out
to
block
that,
that
first
experiment,
at
that
point,
has
to
be
protected,
because,
otherwise,
i'd
have
to
commit
the
infringement
before
i
could
get--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--the...
it
would
be
if
it
was
noncommercial.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
it's
not
directly
you,
your
honor,
because
petitioner
has
not
relied
on
it
at
all,
and
for
good
reason,
which
is
that
the
courts
have
consistently
held
that
the
common
law
research
exception
applies
only
to
noncommercial
activity.
the
most
obvious
example
would
be
kids
in
their
basements.
but
when
a
drug
company,
that
its
entire
business
is
developing
and
manufacturing
drugs,
undertakes
the
activity,
that's
commercial,
and
that's
never
been
considered
protected
by
the
common
law
exception.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
see
my
red
light
is
on,
if
i
could
answer
the
question.
some
of
scripps'work,
when
it's
working
directly
for
merck,
certainly
is,
we
would
think,
you
know,
tied
closely
to
merck's
commercial
activities.
scripps
may
also
do
some
other--
