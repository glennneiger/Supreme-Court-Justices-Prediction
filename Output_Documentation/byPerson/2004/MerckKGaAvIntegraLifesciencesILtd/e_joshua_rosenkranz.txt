mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
thank
you,
your...
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honors,
there
is
no
dispute
among
the
parties,
nor
among
the
19
amicus
briefs
presented
before
the
court
today.
as
to
the
answer
to
the
threshold
legal
question,
everyone
agrees
that
the
fda
exemption
does,
indeed,
apply,
with
full
course,
to
the
sorts
of
experiments
that
are
conducted
and
that
would
be
relevant
to
the
fda
in
consideration
of
an
investigational
new
drug
application,
a
so-called
ind.
so
the
battleground
now
shifts
to
integra's
alternative
arguments
in
support
of
the
judgement--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor.
we
did
not
object
to
the
core
of
the
jury's
instructions
stating
the
legal
standard.
and
we--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the
core
of
the
instruction,
yes,
your
honor,
was--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
i
believe...
the
answer
is,
the
core
was
as
good
as
this
court
can
do,
and--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
it
was
entitled
to
a
verdict
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
let
me
just--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the
federal
circuit
did
understand
that
this
was
a
jmol
case
but--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
it
absolutely
did
not
come
to
grips
with
the
evidence,
nor
did
it
grapple
with
the
alternative
arguments
that
integra
was
presenting--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--so
they--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--that
would
be
one
answer,
your
honor,
reverse
and
not
addressing
the
alternative
legal
grounds,
but
i
would
urge
this
court
to
address
the
alternative
grounds,
because
they
raise--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
research
tools
problem
was
never
presented--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--as
an
issue
before
the
jury
or
before
the
district
court.
and--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
in
fact,
that's
not
even
raised
by
respondents.
it's
raised
by--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--i
would...
i
would
urge
the
court
not
broach
the
subject
of
any
of
the
questions
that
are
not
properly
presented--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--to
this
court.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
we're--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor,
we're
looking
at
the
statute--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--but
it
is
an...
it
is
important,
in
answer
to
the
very
first
question,
to
embellish
a
bit,
because
the
lower
courts
need
this
court's
guidance,
because
every
one
of
the
theories
on
which
integra
defends
the
judgement
below
raise
exactly
the
same
problems
that
the
federal
circuit's
opinion
raises.
they
defy
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
congress
passed.
they
are
equally
at
odds
with
the
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
fda
exemption.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
they
were
not
passed
on
by
the
federal
circuit,
except
perhaps
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
circuit
may
have
concluded
that
all...
or
that,
excuse
me...
that
safety
is
the
only
issue
before
the
fda
when
it
is
considering
an
investigational
new
drug
application,
or
that
a
drug
innovator
may
not
harbor
additional
purposes
in
an
experiment
beyond
the
fda
exemption,
or
that
the...
excuse
me...
beyond
fda
regulatory
purposes...
or,
third,
that
the
exemption
does
not
cover
efforts
to
optimize
the
drug
candidate
after
it's
identified
and
that
candidate
is,
in
fact,
the
lead
candidate.
those
are
the
three
legal
theories,
your
honors,
on
which
integra
is
resting
its
defense
of
the
judgement
below.
and
every
single
one
of
them
is
either
incorrect
as
a
matter
of
law
or
immaterial
as
a
matter
of
law.
if
this
court
were
to
ask
integra
to
come
up
with
a
single
genuine
issue
of
fact
that
does
not
relate
to
one
or
another
of
those
three
propositions,
it
will
not
be
able
to
do
so,
save
a
footnote
to
be
addressed
later
about
the
credibility
of
witnesses
on
a
topic
on
which
integra
never
argued
the
witnesses
were
not
credible.
just
beginning
with
the
safety
question,
and
i'll
defer
to
the
government
on
that,
because
the
government
can
speak
better
than
anyone
else
as
to
what
it
is
that
is
relevant
to
the
fda
in
consideration
of
an
ind,
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
regulations
say,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
safety
is
not
the
only
consideration
before
the
fda
as
it
considers
an
ind.
the
fda
cares
very
much
about
whether
a
drug
will
work:
efficacy.
the
fda
cares
very
much
about
how
it
works:
mechanism
of
action.
it
cares
about
what
the
body
does
to
that
drug:
pharmacokinetics.
and
it
cares
very
much
about
what
that
drug
does
to
the
body:
pharmacology.
and
integra's
position
before
the
jury,
and
before
this
court,
depends
upon
the
proposition
that
it
can
bring
in
a
witness
to
argue
that
the
law
is
other
than
what
the
law
clearly
is.
and
the
same
thing
goes
for
the
so-called
glp
studies
that
the
fda
considers
in
connection
with
safety
data,
but
need
not
limit
itself
to
glp
studies
when
it's
considering
those
other
ind
relevant
topics.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
the
ind,
your
honor,
is
not
in
the
record,
because
it
was
excluded
from
evidence,
which
may
be
why
the
jury
reached
the
wrong
conclusion.
but,
i
hasten
to
add,
that
will
not
be
uncommon
in
these
sorts
of
cases,
because
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
a
preclinical
study
begins
and
fails,
and
the
ind
will
never
materialize.
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
preliminary
injunction
is
brought
and
won,
and
the
research
stops
cold,
so
an
ind
never
materializes.
and,
again,
it's
important
to
understand,
as
one
assesses
the
fda
exemption,
that
the
inquiry
is
always
ex
ante,
it
is
always,
"what
is
a
reasonable
drug
innovator?
"
"what
does
that
drug
innovator
or
scientist
know
at
the
point
in
time
at
which
it
is
about
to
perform
the
next
set
of
experiments?
"
so
you
always
reflect
back
to
a
point
in
time
before
the
ind
materializes.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
there
is
certainly
a
way
to
read
the
federal
circuit's
opinion...
and
this
is
also
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
earlier
question...
in
which
it
did
grapple
with
the
very
questions
we're
talking
about
now,
and
did
answer
the
questions
about
whether
it's
just
safety...
and
i
believe
the
federal
circuit
believed
that
only
safety
data
were
relevant;
that
is
certainly
what
it
indicated
in
oral
argument...
and
also
that
dual
purposes
are
not
permissible.
so
let
me
now
turn
to
the
dual-purpose
question,
because
it's
another
major
theme
of--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there
are
two
ways
to
read
the
federal
circuit's
opinion.
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
circuit
said
nothing
before
the
clinical
stage
is
relevant
to
the
fda
exemption...
if
that
is
what
the
federal
circuit
held,
we
are...
we
are
not
abandoning
the
position
that
that
is
wrong.
i
understand
that
there
is
another
way
to
read
the
federal
circuit's
opinion
that
grapples
with
the
subsidiary
questions
that
we're
discussing
here,
which
are
all
fairly
presented
in
our
question
presented.
and
that's
what
i'm
addressing
myself
to
now.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
and
then,
two
pages
later,
on
12a,
the
federal
circuit
states
its
conclusion,
and
i
quote,
"thus,
the
scripps
work
sponsored
by
merck
was
not
solely
for
use
as
reasonably
related
to
clinical
testing
for
the
fda.
"
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
it's
not
at
all
clear.
and,
just
as
in
boyle,
when
this
court
faced
a
situation
where
it
wasn't
clear
what
the
federal...
or,
excuse
me...
what
the
court
of
appeals
held,
the
court...,
"the
best
thing
for
this
court
to
do
is
to
address
what
appears
to
be
the
threshold
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided.
"
but
then
also
to
address
the
subsidiary
questions
on
the
basis
of
which
integra
is
defending
the
judgement
below.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
i
believe
it
was
the
first
paragraph,
and
i
was
reading
from
the
end
of
that
paragraph,
your
honor,
the...
which
begins,
"thus",
three
lines...
really
two...
the
word
"thus"
is
at
the
end
of
the
third
line
from
the
bottom
of
that
paragraph,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
and
so,
i
was
saying
earlier
that
a
critical
component
of
integra's
case
revolves
around
the
notion
that
the
use
may
not
have
more
than
one
purpose,
and
that
purpose
can
only
be
fda
directed.
that
argument
is
also
incorrect
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
one
way
we
can
tell
that
is
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
preclinical
course
of
study
that
has
only
one
purpose.
when
one
is
studying
mechanism
of
action,
a
scientist
is
deeply
interested,
not
just
in
how
this
drug
works,
but
in
how
the
disease
works.
and
the
language
of
the
statute
is,
of
course,
the
touchstone
here.
the
statute
is
triggered
by
uses.
the
use,
in
this
context,
is
an
experiment.
and
the
statute
covers,
provides
a
safe
harbor
for,
experiments
that
develop
the
sorts
of
information
that
are
relevant
to
the
fda.
if
that--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
the
research-tool
question...
let
me
begin
by
saying,
these
were
not
research
tools;
these
rgd
peptides
were
the
objects
of
study.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
circumstances
in
which
these
peptides
could
be
used
as
research
tools
to
stunt
the
growth
of
blood
vessels
and
study
what
happens
next
with
other
compounds,
but
they
were
emphatically
not
used
as
research
tools
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
they
were
the
objects
of
study,
and
integra
won
a
jury
verdict
based
upon
that
presentation.
in
fact,
never
argued
to
any
court
or
to
the
jury
that
there
is
a
resource
tool
carve
out.
so,
i
was
just
talking
about
the
subjective
purpose
earlier,
and
it
is...
again,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
information
can
be
used
for
other
purposes.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
prohibits
that.
now,
let
me
turn,
just
briefly
then,
to
what
is
often
one
of
the
most
important
questions
in
these
fda
exemption
cases,
which
is
the
timeline
question.
at
what
point
in
the
arc
of
drug
development
is
it
unreasonable
for
a
jury
to
conclude
that
the
fda
is
an
inappropriate
audience
for
the
next
set
of
experiments?
our
position...
and
people
may
differ,
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
to
whether
it
earlier...
but
our
argument
is,
at
a
bare
minimum,
at
the
point
in
time
at
which
a
drug
developer
has
a
known
structure
and
cures
a
disease
in
an
animal
with
that
known
structure,
all
eyes
turn
to
drug
development;
which
is
to
say,
all
eyes
turn
to
the
fda.
as
a
matter
of
law,
everything
after
that,
so
long
as
it's
relevant
to
the
fda,
is
fda...
is
appropriate
to
view
as
fda
directed.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
the
trigger
moment.
if
it
has
a
structure,
and
it's
investigating
analogs
of
that
structure
to
figure
out
which
of
these
various
structures
are
the
best
ones
to
move
forward,
everything
from
that
point
on
is
fda
directed.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor...
and
i
see
my
time
is
running
out;
i'd
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal,
so
let
me,
just
briefly.
under
praprotnik,
of
course,
this
court
is
not
bound
by
law
of
the
case
by
the
instruction.
but
the
instruction,
as
i
understand
it,
says
exactly
what
the
statute
says.
"reasonably
directly"
is
simply
another
way
of
saying,
"are
these
activities
reasonably
related
to
the
fda
purposes?
"
and
every
one
of
the
comparative
experiments
is
relevant
to
the
fda's
inquiry,
whether
this
drug
or
that
is
the
optimum
drug.
every
experiment
that
is
involved
here...
and
there
were
only
10
percent
that
were
comparative
in
nature...
develops
information
about
the
lead
drug
candidate,
including
understanding
why
this
one
works,
rather
than
that
one.
so,
if
it's
all
right,
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
thank
you,
your
honor.
with
my
two
minutes,
i
want
to
make
one
overarching
important
point,
and
it's
really
in
response
to
a
question
justice
scalia
asked.
the
emphasis
in
the
statute
is
about
the
use,
so
let's
get
past
labels
about,
is
this
drug
discovery
or
basic
research,
or
is
it,
as
merck
says,
optimization
on
the
lead
drug
candidate,
and
look
at
exactly
what
was
occurring
here.
here,
this
was
not
a,
"gee,
we'd
like
to
see
what
affects
angiogenesis.
"
merck
knew
what
affected
angiogenesis.
it
had
a
structure.
and
if
you
look
at
page
42
of
the
supplemental
appendix,
you
will
see
that
structure.
it
knew
exactly
what
that
structure
did
and
how
it
did
it.
it
then
tweaked
it
by
changing,
literally,
three
atoms
to
compare
that
activity
with
other
activity,
exactly
the
sorts
of
research
that
any
drug
innovator
would
do
to
verify
that
they
have
the
best
and
most
effective
candidate.
then,
with...
and
with
every
single
one
of
its
experiments,
it
was
examining
information
that
was
relevant
to
mechanism
of
action,
pharmacology,
pharmacokinetics,
and
efficacy.
with
10
percent
of
the
experiments,
it
was
also
running
them
in
parallel
with
a
series
of
analogs
that
were
designed
to
look
exactly
like
the
rgd
peptides,
and
to
work
exactly
like
the
rgd
peptides.
and
no
rational
drug
innovator
ever
proceeds
to
clinical
trials,
nor
does
the
fda
want
it
to,
without
conducting
that
research,
because
you
don't
spend
millions
of
dollars
for
expensive
toxicology
studies
until
you
know
you've
got
the
safest
and
most
effective
drug
candidate.
the
fda
reviews
that
evidence,
because
it
wants
to
know
why
you're
proceeding
with
that
candidate.
and
if
you
shift
midstream
to
another
lead,
as
merck,
in
fact,
did
in
this
very
case,
the
fda
wants
to
understand
why.
so
each
of
those
experiments,
even
in
comparison,
developed
information
that
is
relevant
to
the
fda.
thank
you,
your
honors.
