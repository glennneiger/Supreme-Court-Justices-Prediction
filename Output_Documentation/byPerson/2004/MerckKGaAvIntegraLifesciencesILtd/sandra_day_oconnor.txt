justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
just
clarify
something
for
me
as
we
start
to
consider
the
case?
i
guess
this
thing
went
to
the
jury
under
an
instruction
that
tried
to
come
to
grips
with
the
definition
under
the
statute
in
some
way.
was
that
instruction
one
to
which
merck
preserved
an
objection?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it
was
properly
stated
in
that
instruction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
as
good
as
we
could
do.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
and,
under
that,
you
think
that
merck
was
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--from
the
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
did
not
address
the
case
in...
by
looking
at
the
evidence
and
whether
a
directed
verdict
should
have
been
given--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
it
seemed
to
decide
the
case
based
on
its
view
of
the
statute
as
just
applying
to
generic
drugs
or
something--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so
it
didn't,
in
fact,
come
to
grips
with
the
evidence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
so--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--maybe
all
we
have
to
do
is
deal
with
whether
that
court
should
have
addressed
the
evidence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
of
them?
you
mean,
like
the
research
tools
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
the
tripps
treaty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
and
how
about
the
common-law
research--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--okay,
so--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--all
we're
doing
is
looking
at
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
state
again
what
you
say
the
second
error
was?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
your
position
on
the
jury
instruction?
does
it
correctly
state
the
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
the
court
below
wrong
in
saying
that
the
statute
was
enacted
only
to
help
generic
drug
development?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
that
the
federal
circuit
may
have
focused
too
much
on
generic
drug
applications?
do
you
think
it
was
right
about
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
seemed
to
be
driven
by
its
very
narrow
focus
on
generic
drug
development.
do
you...
do
you
think
that
the
efficacy
of
the
drug
being
suggested
plays
a
role
in
the
ind
application?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
see,
i
think
there
may
be
a
difference
there,
because
i
think
the
other
side
thinks
that
how
the
drug
is
expected
to
work,
in
practice,
and
whether
it,
in
fact,
will
attack
a
certain
disease,
is
part
of
what
the
fda
looks
at.
apparently,
the
government
takes
that
position,
as
narrowly
as
i
could
determine.
but
you
reject
that,
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
you
repeat
that
355
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--(i)--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
does
the...
does
the
statute...
is
that
the
only
place
we
would
look
to
decide
whether
safety
is
the
only
consideration
for
the
fda?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
do--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--you
do
agree,
do
you
not,
that
the
government
does
not
agree
with
you
on
this
point?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but
it's
absolutely
clear,
i
thought,
that
the
fda,
at
the
end
of
the
day
in
some
of
these
drug
applications,
ends
up
looking
at
not
only
safety,
but
how
effective
it
is.
and
sometimes
if
the
safety
risk
is
minimal
but
the
effectiveness
is
great,
i
understood
at
least,
that
could
affect
the
decisions.
so,
i
would
think
that
you
would
want
to
encourage
the
exemption
to
cover
those
matters.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure.
if
there's
data
earlier,
at
ind
stage,
as
a
result
of
the
lab
tests
and
the
animal
tests,
i
would
think
that
would
be
part
of
the
exemption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
don't...
i
hope
we
don't
have
to,
at
this
court,
look
at
all
the
evidence
and
try
to
sort
it
out
that
way.
what
we
have
to
focus
on
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
was
in
error
in
articulating
the
scope
of
the
exemption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
issue
was
whether
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
correctly
determined
the
scope
of
the
exemption.
if
they
were
wrong
about
it,
then
it
is
open
to
us
to
correct
that
and
send
it
back.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exemption.
the
statutory
exemption.
i
thought
that
was
what
we
were
looking
at.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it's
certainly...
that
the
fda
considers
only
safety,
and
nothing
else,
that
it
was
directed
at
generic
drugs,
not
others,
and
that
there
was
a
cutoff
point
earlier
than
that
argued
by
the
government
and
the
petitioner
for
what
is
exempt
preclinical
trial
information.
