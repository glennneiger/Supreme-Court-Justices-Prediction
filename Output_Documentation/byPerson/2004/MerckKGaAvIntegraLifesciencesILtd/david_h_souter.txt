david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
rosenkranz--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
you
agree
then
that
at
whatever
period,
however
you
want
to
describe
the
period,
at
which
the
researcher
is
basically
trying
to
figure
out
what
drug
to
concentrate
on,
that
that
period
is
too
far
back
in
time
to
come
within
the
exception?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
here's
what...
here's
the
problem
i
have
with
your
argument.
i
can
understand
that
argument
more
easily
under
the
statute,
under
the
text
of
the
statute
as
it
is
written,
than
i
can
understand
it
under
the
instruction
that
you
agreed
to,
because
the
instruction
that
you
agreed
to
had
a
limitation,
a
textual
limitation
which
is
not
in
the
statute
itself,
that
refers
to
"relatively
directly"
as
describing
the
relationship
between
this
information
and
its
object.
and
if
we
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
statute,
and
we
read
the
statute
more
broadly
than
the
instruction,
then
you're
getting
something
that
you're
not
entitled
to,
because
you
agreed
to
the
instruction.
if
we
decide
this
issue
by
construing
the
statute
as
if
your
instruction
is
correct,
then
we're
making
an
assumption
about
the
proper
construction
of
the
statute
that
has
not
been
argued
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
me
that
the
law
of
the
case,
as
to
what
the
statute
means
for
your
case,
is
set
by
the
instruction,
and
that
is
why
i
am
reluctant
to
get
into
the
issue
that
you
raise
here,
because
i
think
we're
rather...
you
are
limited,
and
we
are
tied
in
what
we
can
do
as
a
result
of
your
agreement
with
the
instruction.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
going
to
be
your
third
point,
the
third
error
that
the
court
supposedly
committed?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
are
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
are
you
reading
from?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
that
talks
about
the
primary
concern.
there
is
certainly
going
to
be
concern
with
efficacy
to
this
extent.
they
are
going
to
want
to
know,
before
they
allow
clinical
trials,
whether
the
drug
that
it
is
proposed
to
give
cancer
patients
has
some
relationship
to
cancer,
as
opposed
to
the
common
cold.
admittedly,
at
the
clinical
trial
they're
trying
to
find
out
how
effective
it
is
on
human
beings,
but
there's
got
to
be
some
threshold
showing
of
effectiveness.
they
can't
simply
ignore
effectiveness
and
look
at
safety
entirely
prior
to
that
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
is
at
least...
there's
got
to
be
some
way
to
tell
whether
it
even
addresses
the
disease.
that
is
essentially
a
threshold
effectiveness
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
described
the
need
that
there
be
some
relationship
between
the
consequences
of
taking
the
given
drug
and
the
disease
which
is
supposed
to
be
addressed
by
taking
the
drug.
if
they
didn't
use
the
word
"efficacy",
what
word
did
they
use?
