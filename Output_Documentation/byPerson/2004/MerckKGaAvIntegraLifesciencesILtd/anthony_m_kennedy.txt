use
the
peptide

a
research
tool,

my
question.
justice

m.
kennedy

the
earlier
process
that
you
described,
the
basic
research,
is

research
exemption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
the
common
law
of
research
exemption
figure
into
this
case,
if
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy

justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
difference
between
you
and
merck
concerning
the
scope
and
extent
of
the
common
law
research
exemption?
and
if
there
is,
does

even
enter
into
our
case?
