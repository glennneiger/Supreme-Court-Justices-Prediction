mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
the
alternative
grounds
that
you're
discussing
now
passed
on
by
the
federal

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
moment
ago...
a
moment
ago,
you
were
reading
from
12(a).
was
it
the
first
sentence
you
were
reading
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rosenkranz.
mr.
joseffer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
to
have
the
fda's
permission
to
start
clinical
testing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
in
fact
the
jury
instruction
is
too
general.
i
mean,
if
both
parties
agreed
to
it,
aren't
they,
in
a
sense,
bound
by
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
petitioner
said
he
agreed
with
the
core
of
the
instruction,
whatever
that
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
the
consequences
if
someone
goes
ahead
and
conducts
a
clinical
trial
without
the
approval
of
the
fda?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
joseffer.
mr.
flores.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
not
reviewing
the
district
court's
opinion?
we
granted
certiorari
as
to
the
particular
question
which
will
deal
with
what
was
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
we
don't
ordinarily
simply
compare
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
with
the
district
court's
opinion
to
see
if
they
parse.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
spent
about
ten
pages
in
the
appendix
trying
to
do
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
flores.
mr.
rosenkranz,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice

thank
you,
