justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rosenkrantz,
the
items
you
listed
earlier
seemed
to
me
to
more
narrow
than
what
i
took
to
be
the
point
of
your
opening
brief,
which
was
that
the
decision
below
was
wrong
because
the
federal
circuit
simply
excluded
all
consideration
of
materials
prepared
for
purposes
of
the
ind,
as
opposed
to
materials
prepared
for
the...
for
the
drug
application,
later
on.
are
you
abandoning
that
more
expansive
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i
don't
read
the
opinion
that
way.
i
don't
think
that
opinion
has
to
be
read
to
say
that
they're
not
going
to
allow
in
anything
that
goes
to
the
ind.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
you
answered
my
question?
you're
abandoning
the
assertion
that
the
federal
circuit
did
not
consider
anything
that
didn't
go
to
the
ind...
that
didn't
go
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--drug
application.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
it...
it's
not
at
all
clear
in
the
opinion
that
the
court
was
using
preclinical
and
clinical
in
the
very
technical
sense
that
you
were...
that
you
use
it,
which
means
"clinical"
is
stuff
submitted
for
the
drug
application,
and
"preclinical"
is
for
the
earlier
application.
that
is
not
at
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that
might
well
determine
whether
the
research
was
relatively
directly
related.
i
mean,
if
i
were
a
juror,
i
would...
i
would
say
it's
relatively
directly
related
if
it
relates
to
that
particular
compound
which
is
ultimately
submitted,
and
not
relatively
directly
related
if
it
was
preliminary,
trying
to
found
out
which
compound
to
submit.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
understand
all
that.
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
just
saying
that
that
is
certainly
one
interpretation
of
"reasonably
directly".
and
if
that
is
so,
then
you
are
erroneous
in
your
assumption
that
the
question
before
this
court
is
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
it
might
not
be.
it
might
be...
it
might
be
the
meaning
of
the
instruction.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
basic
research?
i
mean,
i
want
to...
i
want
to
treat
this
disease
by
stifling
the
development
of
blood
cells
around
it,
or
something
like
that,
and
then
you
ask
yourself,
"gee,
what
would
stifle
the
production
of
blood
cells?
"
and
let's
assume
there
hasn't
been
any
research
done
in
that
field
before.
you
wouldn't
consider
that
basic
research,
so
long
as
the
idea
i
have
in
my...
in
my
head
is,
i
want
to
create
a
drug
to
treat
this
disease
that
will
stifle
blood
cells?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i
think...
i
think
the
justice
was
asking
whether
it
was
the
court
of
appeals
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
applied
a
particular
standard.
and
certainly
it
had
to
have
been.
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
have
a
particular
standard
as
to
what
constituted
general
biomedical
experimentation,
as
opposed
to
the
kind
of
experimentation
that's
covered
by
the...
by
the
safe
harbor
exemption?
it
must
have
had.
i
mean,
how
could
you...
how
could
you
rule
on
the
question
before
you
unless
you
have,
in
your
head,
a
notion
of
what
the
safe
harbor
consists
of
and
what
is
beyond
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
it...
the...
and
this
is
why
i
was
disagreeing
with
counsel
from
the
other
side.
it...
well,
counsel
ultimately
conceded,
you
could
read
it
not
to
draw
the
line
between
clinical
and
preclinical.
and
the
way
you
read
this
sentence
is...
the
question,
they
say,
is
not
whether
preclinical
research
falls
under
271(e)(1);
it's
whether
the
"preclinical
research
conducted
under
the
scripps
merck
agreement.
"
and
then
the
next
sentence
explains
what
that
means.
the
experiments
did
not
supply
information
for
submission
to
the
united
states
food
and
drug
administration,
but,
instead,
identified
the
best
drug
candidate.
so,
i
think
what
they're
describing
as
the
question
presented
is
whether
preclinical
research
that
is...
that
is
not
directed
to
supplying
information
for
submission
to
the
food
and
drug
administration,
but,
instead,
to
selecting
the
drug
candidate,
whether
that
type
of
preclinical
research
is
within
the
safe
harbor.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
so
what?
i
don't
understand
what
conclusion
that
leads
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
beginning
to
think
that,
too.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
beginning
in
the
early
1990s
and
continuing
into
1998,
petitioner,
merck,
supplied
rgd
peptides
developed
in
its
labs
in
germany
to
the
scripts
research
institute
in
san
diego
for
use
in
research
on
angiogenesis,
the
process
by
which
new
blood
vessels
grow
from
those
already
existing.
angiogenesis
plays
an
important
role
in
many
diseases
including
the
growth
of
cancerous
tumors
and
rheumatoid
arthritis.
from
1994
to
1998,
scientists
at
scripts
performed
research
on
variations
of
petitioner’s
peptides
to
determine
which
was
the
most
suitable
as
a
candidate
for
testing
on
humans.
the
research
ultimately
settled
on
a
particular
peptide
in
1997
and
a
year
later,
the
national
cancer
institute
submitted
an
investigatory
new
drug
application,
an
ind,
to
the
food
and
drug
administration
seeking
permission
to
test
that
peptide
on
humans
in
clinical
trials.
in
july
1996
in
the
midst
of
research
at
scripts,
respondent,
integra
lifesciences,
sued
petitioner
alleging
that
its
provision
of
the
rgd
peptides
to
scripts
infringed
integra
lifesciences’
patents.
petitioner
answered
that
respondent’s
patents
did
not
cover
its
peptides
and
that
its
use
was
in
any
case
exempted
from
infringement
by
35
u.s.c.
section
271(e)(1)
which
provides
that
“it
shall
not
be
an
active
infringement
to
use
or
import
into
the
united
states
a
patented
invention
solely
for
uses
reasonably
related
to
the
development
and
submission
of
information
under
a
federal
law
which
regulates
the
use
of
drugs.”
a
jury
disagreed
with
petitioner
on
both
issues
and
awarded
damages
of
$15
million.
petitioner
appealed
each
determination.
a
panel
of
the
federal
circuit
unanimously
affirmed
the
district
court’s
determination
that
petitioner
infringed
respondent’s
patents
but
divided
on
the
question
whether
petitioner
was
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
under
section
217(e)(1).
the
panel
majority
concluded
that
it
was
not.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
construction
of
271(e)(1)
on
which
this
conclusion
rested.
finding
that
the
court
of
appeals
adapted
an
unduly
narrow
interpretation
of
271(e)(1)’s
exemption,
we
vacate
its
judgment
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
though
not
exact
in
every
respect,
271(e)(1)’s
plain
language
provides
wide
scope
for
the
use
of
patented
drugs
in
activities
related
to
the
federal
regulatory
process.
first,
we
think
it
apparent
from
271(e)(q)’s
text
that
its
exemption
from
infringement
extends
to
all
uses
of
all
patented
inventions
that
are
reasonably
related
to
the
development
of
any
information
under
the
fdca,
the
federal
food
drug
and
cosmetics
act.
contrary
to
what
some
portions
of
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
seem
to
suggest,
this
necessarily
includes
information
developed
in
pre-clinical
studies
for
submission
in
an
ind
application
and
is
not
limited
to
safety
related
information.
a
review
of
fda
regulations
makes
clear
that
the
fda
is
interested
in
more
that
just
safety.
at
this
stage,
it
is
also
interested
in
information
relating
to
a
drug’s
efficacy,
pharmacology,
and
pharmacokinetics
as
well.
second,
we
do
not
think
that
section
271(e)(1)
is
limited
to
either
experimentation
on
drugs
that
are
ultimately
the
subject
of
an
fda
submission
or
use
of
patented
compounds
in
experiments
that
are
ultimately
actually
submitted
to
the
fda.
to
limit
the
exemption
in
this
fashion,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
would
disregard
the
reality
that
even
at
late
stages
in
the
development
of
a
new
drug,
scientific
testing
is
a
process
of
trial
and
error.
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
neither
the
drug
maker
nor
its
scientists
have
any
way
of
knowing
whether
an
initially
promising
candidate
will
prove
successful
over
a
battery
of
experiments.
that
is
the
reason
they
conduct
the
experiments.
thus,
to
construe
271(e)(1)
as
the
court
of
appeals
did,
not
to
protect
research
conducted
on
patented
compounds
for
which
an
ind
is
not
ultimately
filed
is
affectively
to
limit
assurance
of
exemption
to
the
activities
necessary
to
seek
approval
of
a
generic
drug.
one
can
know
what
the
outset
that
a
particular
compound
will
be
the
subject
of
an
eventual
application
to
the
fda,
only
if
the
active
ingredient
in
the
drug
being
tested
is
identical
to
that
in
a
drug
that
has
already
been
approved.
the
text
of
the
exemption
extends
well
beyond
generic
drug
applications,
however,
and
we
decline
to
adapt
the
construction
of
the
reasonable
relation
requirement
that
would
produce
such
a
limitation.
for
similar
reasons,
we
think
that
the
exemption
includes
use
of
patented
compounds
in
experiments.
the
results
of
which
are
not
included
in
a
submission
to
the
fda.
in
sum,
at
least
where
a
drug
maker
has
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
a
patented
compound
may
work
through
a
particular
biological
process
to
produce
a
particular
physiological
effect
and
uses
the
compound
in
research
that,
if
successful,
would
be
appropriate
to
include
in
a
submission
to
the
fda.
that
use
is
“reasonably
related
to
the
development
and
submission
of
information
under
federal
law
as
271(e)(1)
requires.”
for
these
reasons,
we
conclude
that
the
federal
circuit
rejected
petitioner’s
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
challenge
on
the
basis
of
a
construction
of
271(e)(1)
that
was
not
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
provision
or
the
relevant
jury
instruction.
we
decline
to
undertake
a
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
under
a
proper
construction
of
271
on
our
own
for
the
first
time
here.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
