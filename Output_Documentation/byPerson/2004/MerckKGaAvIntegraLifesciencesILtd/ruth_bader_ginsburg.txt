mr.
rosenkranz,
just
one
piece
of
information.
because
the
ind
is
so
important
at
this
point,
is
it
in
the
record...
do
we
have
a
copy
of
the
ind?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
first
answer,
are
you
relying
what
the
federal
circuit
said
in
its
opinion...
and
it's
in
10a
of
our
cert
petition
appendix...
that
is,
the
federal
circuit's
statement
of
the
question
presented,
whether
the
preclinical
research
conducted
under
scripps
merck
agreement
is
exempt
from
liability
for
infringement
of
integra's
patents.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
time
is
short,
so
could
you
tell
us
how
far
back
you
think,
under
the
statute,
you
can
go
and
not...
and
be
within
the
safe
harbor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
this?
page
14a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
are
you
quoting
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
we
say
that's
the
question,
when
the
federal
circuit,
itself,
said
what
i
read
before
from
10a?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
flores,
when
i
asked
you
about
the
sentence
on
page
10,
i
intended,
not
the
one
that
you
read,
but
an
earlier
one
that
precedes
it,
and
that
is,
"the
questioning
arising
in
this
case
is
whether
the
preclinical
research.
"
--that
is,
the
research
on
animals,
as
distinguished
from
humans...
"conducted
under
the
scripps-merck
agreement
is
exempt
from
liability
for
infringement
of
integra's
patents.
"
now,
if
you
just
took
that
as
the
question,
then
you
would
say
it...
this
circuit
is
drawing
the
line
between
clinical
and
preclinical.
it's
not
a
crystal-clear
opinion,
by
any
means,
but
that
is
one
question
presented
that
they've
identified.
and
how
do
they
answer
that
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this
text
that
you're
referring
to,
is
it
someplace...
is
the
text
someplace
where
we
can
look
at
it
while
you're
explaining
this
to
us?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
wouldn't
it
have
information
about
effectiveness
on
animals?
i
mean,
if
the...
you
show
that
the...
all
the
fda's
interested
in
is
that
it
didn't
kill
the
animal,
never
mind
whether
it
was
effective
to
cure
the
tumor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
dissenting
judge
did
not...
the
dissenting
judge,
judge
newman,
did
not
read
the
court's
opinion
the
way
you
do.
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
we
should
take
that
into
account,
to
some
extent,
that
someone
who
participated
on
the
bench
had
a
different
take
on
what
her
colleagues
were
saying?
