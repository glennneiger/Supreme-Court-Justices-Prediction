mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
stated,
in
black
versus
cutter
laboratories,
which
is
cited
on
page
27
of
our
brief,
as
follows,
"at
times,
the
atmosphere
in
which
an
opinion
is
written
may
become
so
surcharged
that
unnecessarily
broad
statements
are
made.
"
"in
such
a
case,
it
is
our
duty
to
look
beyond
the
broad
sweep
of
the
language
and
determine
for
ourselves
precisely
the
ground
on
which
the
judgement
rests.
"
this
is
such
a
case.
the
judgement
of
the
federal
circuit
was
its
order
affirming
the
district
court's
denial
of
motion
for
judgement
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
precise
grounds
for
the
federal
circuit's
opinion
is
set
forth
in
page
14a
in
the
appendix
attached
to
merck's
petition
for
certiorari.
and
there
the
federal
circuit
said
that
it
upheld
the
denial
of
merck's
motion
for
judgement
as
a
matter
of
law
because
the
federal
circuit
discerned
no
error
in
the
district
court's
interpretation
of
section
271(e)(1),
which
raises
the
question--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--yes,
your--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
"because
the
language
and
context
of
the
safe
harbor
do
not
embrace
the
scripps-merck
general
biomedical
experimentation,
this
court
discerns
no
error--
"
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--the
precise
holding
and
the
reasoning
of
the
federal
circuit
was,
they
found
no
error
in
what
the
district
court's--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
the
only
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
can
be
found
in
the
district
court's
order
denying
merck's
motion
for
judgement
as
a
matter
of
law
is
the
standard
articulated
in
the
jury
instruction.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
the
question
before
the
federal
circuit
was
whether
the
district
court
erred
by
not
applying
the
rational
predicate
interpretation
of
section
271(e),
which
was
the
sole
focus
of
merck's
appeal
to
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
we're...
on
page
10a,
the
federal
circuit
said,
"thus"...
and
this
is
in
the...
the
last
sentence
in
the
middle
paragraph
of
the
page...
"thus,
this
court
must
determine
whether
section...
the
section
271(e)
safe
harbor
reaches
back
down
the
chain
of
experimentation
to
embrace
development
and
identification
of
new
drugs
that
will,
in
turn,
be
subject
to
fda
approval.
"
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
it
does
not.
the
federal
circuit
answered
that
in
the
negative.
the
federal
circuit
rejected
the
interpretation
advanced
by
merck,
which
was
the
rational
predicate
standard,
which
was
basically
a
causal
test,
and
held
that
the
district
court's
interpretation,
under
the
intermedics
standard
that's
given
in
the
jury
instruction,
that
merck
now
concedes
is
the
correct
standard.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
law.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
this
aspect
of
the
federal
circuit's
opinion
and
makes
that
clear
at
the
bottom
of
page
15
and
onto
page
16
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
merck
no
longer
challenges
this
aspect
of
the
federal
circuit's
opinion.
merck
concedes
that
there
are
experiments
in
the
basic
research
phase,
that,
although
they're
necessary
in
the
chain
of
causation,
are
not
exempt.
the
rational...
merck
has
abandoned
the
rational
predicate
standard
that
the
federal
circuit
rejected
here.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
your
honor,
i
disagree.
i
think
the
operative
language
in
this
sentence
is
the
reference
to
"the
scripps-merck"...
is
to
"research
conducted
under
the
scripps-merck
agreement.
"
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
yes.
in
fact,
justice
scalia,
if
this
opinion
by
the
federal
circuit
were
interpreted
to
hold
that
preclinical
experiments
are
categorically
excluded
from
the
scope
of
the
exemption,
that
holding
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
district
court's
interpretation
of
the
law,
because
the
district
court's
interpretation
of
the
law
was
that
preclinical
experiments
are
potentially
eligible,
and
the
district
court
submitted
the
question
to
the
jury.
so
the
federal
circuit
would
be
completely
inconsistent,
if,
on
the
one
hand,
it
categorically
excluded
preclinical
experiments,
and,
on
the
other
hand,
it
approved
the
district
court's
reasoning--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--the
reason
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
do
so
is
because
no
standard,
other
than
the
intermedics
standard
that
was
applied
by
the
district
court,
was
ever
suggested
to
the
district
court.
there
was
only
one
standard
ever
considered.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
yes,
your
honor.
but
in
this
case
the
issue
before
the
district
court
was
whether
the
district
court
erred
in
denying
a
motion
for
judgement
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
i
think
the
federal
circuit
was
right,
as
a
factual
matter,
describing
the
impetus
for
congress
adopting
section
271(e).
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
in
the
statute.
it's
a...
it's
section...
it's
21
united
states
code
355(i)(3)(b)(i).
and
in
that--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--(i)--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--(3)--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--(b)(i)
again.
and,
in
this
section,
congress
is
telling
the
fda
what
are
the
considerations
that
the
fda
has
to
weigh
in
making
the
safety
decision,
the
decision
whether
to
allow
clinical
trials
in
humans--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not
in
the
appendix,
unfortunately.
let
me
read
that
statute,
because
it's
instructive
about
what
congress
told
fda
to
weigh
for
the--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--no,
your
honor.
the
regulations,
i
believe,
address
that.
and
the
regulations
are
312.22(a),
which
is
in
the
appendix
attached
to
integra's
brief
on
the
merits.
and
i'll
read
that.
it
says--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--the
government
disagrees,
your
honor.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
page
3a
in
the
addendum
to
integra's
brief.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
that's
21
c.f.r.
section
312.22(a).
it
states
that,
"the
fda's
primary
objectives
in
reviewing
an
ind
are,
in
all
phases
of
the
investigation,
to
assure
the
safety
and
rights
of
subjects,
and,
in
phase
two
and
three,
to
help
assure
that
the
quality
of
the
scientific
investigation
of
the
drugs
is
adequate
to
prevent
an
evaluation
of
the
drug's
effectiveness
and
safety.
"
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
but
it
does...
it
refers
to
it
in
the
context
of
phases
two
and
three.
and
the
simple
fact
is
that
until
there's
clinical
trials
in
humans,
there's
no
way
tell
whether
this
drug
a
going
to
be
effective.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
the
fda
statutes
and
regulations
do
not
use
the
term
"efficacy"
to
describe
that.
in
section
355(i)(3)(b)(i),
when
congress
listed
the
factors
to
consider,
what
it
listed
was
not
efficacy.
efficacy
is
not
to
be
found--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--they--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--no,
your
honor,
they
used
the
word,
in
the
statute,
"the
condition
for
which
the
drug
is
to
be
investigated.
"
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
the
answer
is
that
the
fda
considers
what
information
is
available
to
it.
it
does
not
have
information
about
the
effectiveness
of
the
drug,
because
clinical
trials
have
not
taken
place;
and,
therefore,
the
regulations
and
the
statutes
say
you
do
the...
what
you
can.
you
look
at
the
condition
for
which
the
drug--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--the
fda
is
concerned
with
safety
in
animals.
and
there
may
be
some
cases
in
which
there
is
a
known
safety
risk
to
a
drug,
and
there
will
be
a
heightened
look
at
potential
benefits
in
order
to
balance
that
out.
but
the
regulations
focus
on
safety.
and
in
this
particular--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--your
honor,
of
course
fda
is
very
concerned
about
efficacy,
and
it...
but
concerned
about
that
after
it
gets
data
from
human
clinical
trials.
that's
the...
that
is
the
basis
of--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--if
efficacy...
or
some
information
about
what
benefits
the
drug
might
have,
is
probably
a
better
way
to
phrase
it...
is
considered
at
the
safety
stage
as
part
of
the
safety
balancing,
then
it's
got
to
be
done
under
good
laboratory
practices,
because--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--if...
i
believe
the
solicitor
general's
point
is
that
the
safety
decision
is
a
practical
one,
and
you've
got
to
look
at
both
sides
of
the
ledger...
potential
harm,
potential
benefit...
i
don't
believe
it's
proper
to
call
that
"efficacy".
but
whatever
you
call
it,
if
it's
part
of
the
safety
balancing
it
has
to
be
done
under
good
laboratory
procedures.
that,
i
think,
is
clear
from
the
fda
regulations.
and,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
for
the
fda
to
say
that
half
of
the
safety
equation
need
not
be
done
under
good
laboratory
practices.
both
parts
of
the
safety
equation
have
to
be
done
under
that.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
well,
justice
scalia,
let
me
say
that
i
think
that
this
whole
discussion
about
the
interpretation
of
the
fda
law
is
really
somewhat
off
the
point
here.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
we're
not
here
to
judge
the
legality
of
an
fda
action
in
its
discretion,
saying
we
want
to
consider
preclinical--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--that
is
correct.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
well,
your
honor,
there's
numerous
admissions
in
the
record
that
merck
made
which
would
indicate
that
they've...
that
the
program
carried
out
at
scripps
was
not
reasonably
related
to
the
fda,
that
the
real
fda
work
was
being
done
in
germany,
that
the
majority
of
these
experiments
conducted
by
scripps
were
conducted
on
chicken
embryos,
which
merck's
own
scientists
agree
have
nothing
to
do
with
safety,
and,
by
logical
extension,
they
can't
tell
you
much
about
efficacy,
either.
merck
agreed
that
a
significant
portion
of
these
experiments
in
which
merck
was
looking
for
non-peptide
compounds
as
possible
drug
candidates,
is
something
that--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--your
honor,
this
court
does
not
have
to
get
into
rule
50
review
of
the
evidence
here--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--because
there's
no
dispute
about
the
legal
standard.
we've
all
heard
that
this
morning.
the
only
other
possible
issue
is
rule
50
review.
but
merck
has
failed--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--your
honor,
the
federal
circuit
didn't
determine
the
scope
of
the
invention.
there's...
it's--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--yes,
that's
what
i
was
referring
to.
the
federal
circuit
didn't
articulate
a
standard
for
that.
the
federal
circuit
approved
the
district
court's
use
of
the
intermedics
standard,
under
which
preclinical
experiments
are
potentially--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--the
federal
circuit's
opinion,
i
believe...
the
federal
circuit's
opinion
rejects
the
rational
predicate
theory.
it
does
not
articulate
an
alternative
standard
to
that.
it
merely--
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
--but
federal
circuit
didn't
do
that.
that
was
discussion
in
there.
it
gave
a
lot
of
background
about
the
statute,
which
may
not
have
been
necessary
for
its
ultimate
holding.
but
the
federal
circuit,
when
it
comes
down
to
it,
didn't
do
anything
other
than
approve
the
district
court's
interpretation.
now,
if
the
federal
circuit
did
something
different
than
that,
which
we
just...
which
is...
integra
does
not
believe
is
the
case,
its
judgement
should
be
upheld
on
the
grounds
articulated,
that
it
could
discern
no
error
in
the
district
court's
judgement...
in
the
district
court's
denial
of
merck's
motion
for
judgement
as
a
matter
of
law.
to
respond
to
one
of
justice
o'connor's
earlier
questions,
"does
this
court
have
to
get
into
a
rule
50
review.
"
the
answer
is
no,
because
merck
failed
to
preserve
its
right
to
rule
50
review.
in
the
district
court,
in
the
federal
circuit,
the...
merck
argued
the
rational
predicate
standard
as
a
matter
of
law.
that
was
rejected.
rule
50
review,
under
the
intermedics
standard,
is
an
entirely
different
argument,
and
merck
never
raised
that
argument
in...
before
the
federal
circuit.
in
its
brief,
merck
relies,
on
pages
50
and
51
of
its
brief
to
the
federal
circuit,
saying
there
it
argued
substantial
evidence.
but
what
it
argued
there
was,
the
experiments
are
rational
predicates.
merck
never
argued,
before
the
federal
circuit,
that
the
verdict
can't
be
sustained
under
rule
50,
under
the
intermedics
standard,
as
opposed
to
the
rational
predicate
standard,
so
it's
not
entitled
to
that
review
here.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
that
is
certainly
a
consideration,
but
we
disagree
with
judge
newman
on
that
point.
mr.
mauricio
a.
flores
that
issue
hasn't
entered
into
the
case,
so
there's
been
no
differences
articulated,
your
honor.
and
to
get
back
to
the
point
that
merck
did
not
preserve
its
right
to
rule
50
review
under
the
intermedics
standard,
even
if
it
had
raised
that
issue
before
the
federal
circuit,
clearly
the
federal
circuit
didn't
reach
that
issue.
and
if
the
federal
circuit
didn't
reach
an
issue
that
was
properly
presented
before
it,
that
was
error,
and
merck
would
have
had
to
seek
relief
from
that
error.
and
it
did
not
do
so
in
its
petition
for
certiorari.
so,
i
do
not
believe
this
court
even
needs
to
address
the
issue
of
rule
50
review.
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
as
to
the
substantive
standard
that
governs
the
scope
of
section
271(e)(1),
and
merck,
having
failed
to
preserve
its
rights
to
rule
50
review
under
the
intermedics
standard,
there
his
no
controversy
for
this
court
to
decide.
if
the
court
does
reach
the
issue
of
rule
50
review
under
intermedics,
it
is...
the
case
should
be
decided
under
the
basic
principles
that
it
is
the
exclusive
province
of
the
jury
to
weigh
the
evidence
and
to
determine
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses.
and
my
time
is
up,
but...
almost...
but
i'll
say
one
thing.
after
25
days
of
trial,
the
district
judge,
in
his
denial
of
merck's
motion
for
judgement
as
a
matter
of
law,
expressly
said
that
the
jury
had
reasonable
cause
to
disregard
the
testimony
of
merck's
main
witness,
dr.
cheresh.
and,
on
that
ground
alone,
the
judgement
with
the
federal
circuit
should
be
sustained.
merck
can't
be
rescued
from
the
jury's
verdict
unless
this
court
determines,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
the
jury
was
required
to
believe
the
testimony
of
dr.
cheresh.
and
merck
can't
show
that,
and
hasn't
even
attempted
to
show
that.
unless
there
are
any
questions--
