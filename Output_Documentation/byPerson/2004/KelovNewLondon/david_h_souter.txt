justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
that
the
city
instead
of
taking
the
property
by
eminent
domain
simply
used
its,
its
own...
some
of
its
own
regular
tax
income
to
buy
up
the
property,
and
assembled
parcels
of
land
with
the
purpose
of
selling
them
to
an
industrial
developer
to
raise
the
tax
base
and
hence
ultimately
to
raise
taxes.
would
you
say
just
within
the
meaning
of
general
understanding
of
proper
governmental
purposes
that
the
city
was
acting
in
a
way
that
had
no
legitimate
public
purpose?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
interested
in
the
label.
i'm
just
saying
if
the
government
says
we
need
to
increase
the
tax
base
because
we
have
a
depressed
city,
so
we
are
going
to
take
some
of
our
tax
money
now,
and
we
are
just
going
to
buy
up
property
that
people
are
willing
to
sell
to
us,
and
we
are
going
to
assemble
parcels.
and
when
we
get
a
big
enough
one,
we
are
going
to
sell
them
to
a
developer
for
industrial
purposes.
and
that
will,
that
will
raise
the
tax
base.
is
there
anything
illegitimate
as
a
purpose
for
governmental
spending
in
doing
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
there
a
public
purpose
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
we
are
talking
about...
i
mean,
i
realize
that,
but
i
mean,
i
thought
your
point
was
that
it
was
use
of
eminent
domain
power
for
an
improper
purpose.
and
you
characterize
that
purpose
as
conveying
property
to
private
owners.
well,
in
my
example,
the
same
thing
is
going
on
except
that
it's
not
using
the
eminent
domain
power.
if
the
purpose
in
my
example
is
a
proper
public
purpose,
why
isn't
it
a
proper
public
purpose
when
the
government
does
it
by
eminent
domain?
what
changes
about
the
purpose?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that
is
your
answer
then
the
slum
clearance
cases
have
got
to
go
the
other
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is
your
answer,
then
i
suppose
the
slum
clearance
cases
were
wrongly
decided.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
are
saying
we
don't
have
to
reexamine
it,
but
i
think
your
adoption
of
justice
scalia's
approach
puts
you
in
a
difficult...
i
think
you're
moving
in
the
direction
of
saying
we
really
have
got
to
overrule
the
prior
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
just
for
the
moment,
what
about
my
question?
and
you
can
get
into
history,
if
you
want
to,
and
i
tend
to
be
interested
in
that,
but
my
immediate
concern
is,
if
you
give
the
answer
that
you
have
just
given,
doesn't
it
jeopardize
the
precedent
of
the
slum
clearance
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
there
isn't,
but
maybe
there
is,
there
isn't
any
question
in
this
case
that
the
city
was
acting
in
good
faith
and
did...
and
i
presume
still
does...
intend
to
convey
it
to
developers
who
will,
will
actually
proceed
to
develop
a
project.
is
there
a
question
about
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
in
other
words,
i
can
understand
perfectly
well,
why
we
would
want
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
use
of
the
eminent
domain
power
that
takes
a
parcel
of
property
from
private
person
a
and
simply
then
reconveys
it
to
private
person
b
without
any
particular
object
in
mind
except
that
the
city
likes
b,
you
know,
the
mayor
is
a
democrat
and
b
is
a
democrat.
that
kind
of
thing.
so
i
can
understand
the
need
for
some
distinction
between
that
case
and
what
we've
got
here.
the
question
is
when
you
say
there
have
to
be
minimum
standards,
i
guess,
is
do
we
have
a
problem
historically
or
in
this
case
about
the
good
faith
of
the
taking
so
that
we
need
the
minimum
standards
to
make
sure
that
we
are
not
getting
into
the
first
example?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
a
reason
in
this
case?
is
there
some
doubt
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you,
i'm
sorry,
i'll
make
this
a
quick
question.
why
do
you
think
it
is
necessary,
given
your
position,
why
do
you
think
it's
necessary
to
adopt
the
test
you've
just
articulated
as
distinct
simply
from
a
good
faith
requirement.
so
that
if
somebody
objected
and
offered
to
prove
bad
faith,
that
would
be
in
effect
a
defense
for
the
taking?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
horton,
what
do
you
think
is
the
reason
that
there
are
not
a
lot
of
examples
of
the
sort
that
i
think
one
of
justice
o'connor's
hypotheticals
raised,
in
which
the,
i
don't
know,
the
econoline
motel
gets
condemned
so
that
the
ritz
can
be
built,
thereby
increasing
tax
revenue
and
so
on,
kind
of
parcel
by
parcel
augmentations
to
the
tax
base
and
so
on.
why
aren't
there
a
lot
of
examples
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
which
case
we
have
a
different--
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
we
have
transaction
costs.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
loans
don't
make
him
whole.
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
mean,
what
bothered
justice
breyer
i
guess
bothers
a
lot
of
us.
and
that
is,
is
there
a
problem
of
making
the
homeowner
or
the
property
owner
whole?
but
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that
is
that
goes
to
the
measure
of
compensation
which
is
not
the
issue
here.
