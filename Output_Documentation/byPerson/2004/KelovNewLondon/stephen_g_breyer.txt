stephen
g.
breyer
justice
douglas
says
there
that
as
long
as
it's
an
objective
within
congress
and
legislature's
legitimate
grant
of
power,
they
can
do
it,
i
mean,
as
long
as
there's
a...
so
why
does
there
have
to
be
a
limit
within
that
broad
limit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
there
can't,
purely.
but
there
is
no
taking
for
private
use
that
you
could
imagine
in
reality
that
wouldn't
also
have
a
public
benefit
of
some
kind,
whether
it's
increasing
jobs
or
increasing
taxes,
et
cetera.
that's
a
fact
of
the
world.
and
so
given
that
fact
of
the
world,
that
is
law,
why
shouldn't
the
law
say,
okay,
virtually
every
taking
is
all
right,
as
long
as
there
is
some
public
benefit
which
there
always
is
and
it's
up
to
the
legislature.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it
could
only
be
taken
if
there
is
a
public
use
and
there
almost
always
is.
now,
do
you
agree
with
that,
or
do
you
not
agree
with
my
last
empirical
statement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's,
of
course,
my
question.
the
question
is,
if
you
agree
with
the
empirical
statement
that
there
almost
always
is
some
public
benefit
attached,
then
my
question
is,
why
must
there
be
a
limit
within
that
broad
framework?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
this
seems
to
be
really
essential
for
the
purpose
of
developing
industrial
property
to
increase
the
tax
base.
the
argument
is,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
reason
to
doubt
it,
that
doing
it
seriatim
by
voluntary
acquisition
and
sale
doesn't
work.
so
the
rationale
for
this
is
essentially
the
rationale
for
the
railroads,
for
the
public
utility
line
condemnations
and
so
on.
there
isn't
another
practical
way
to
do
it.
and
there
is
a
public
benefit
at
the
end,
and
that
ought
to
qualify
it
as
a
public
use.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
latter.
i
mean,
i
understand
the
former.
that's
a
big
retreat
and
it
comes
to
me
now
you're
getting
to
what
i
think
is
a
possible
realm
of
reason
here.
but
the
second
part
now
you
said
and
minimum
standards.
what
minimum
standards?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
mean,
are
you
advocating
particular
ones?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
about
the
standard.
go
back
for
a
second.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
gather
that
the
iowa
courts
have
a
standard
that
includes
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
intended
public
use
will
take
place.
now,
is
that
the
standard
you're
advocating?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
lot
of
disagreement
about
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you
might...
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
assurance
that
there
will
in
fact
be
the
public
use
which
the
state
uses
as
the
justification
for
taking
the
property.
is
that
going
to
help
you
that
much?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
this
court
could
get
into
the
business
of
saying
you
have
to
have
this
by
a
particular
day
or
you
have
to
have
14
witnesses.
i
mean,
we
couldn't
impose
that
sort
of
thing,
could
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
needs
to
be
a
reasonable
assurance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
might
well
need
it
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he
doesn't...
he
doesn't,
his
second
test
does
not
adopt
that.
the
second
test
which
he
was
arguing
at
the
end
is
just
that
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
assurance
that
the
public
use,
and
it
could
include
all
those
things,
will
in
fact
take
place.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
be,
but
what
do
you
think
of
that
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
can't
the
courts
at
least...
can't
the
courts,
could
the
courts...
do
you
object
to
this,
and
i'm
not
advocating
it,
i
want
your
reaction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
the
courts,
under
this
clause,
at
least
review
what
you've
just
said
for
reasonableness?
i
mean,
look
at
the
reasonableness
of
a
claim
that
this
is
for...
basically
for
a
public
use.
look
at
the
reasonableness
of
the
claim
that
we
should
do
it
this
way,
rather
than
excusing
the
people
who
don't
want
to
sell
their
houses
no
matter
what
and
doing
it
a
little
bit
differently.
reasonableness
is
a
concept
that's
already
in
the
constitution
in
terms
of
what
the
legislature
can
do,
but
i'm
thinking
of
the
stronger
kind
of
reasonableness
review
that
you
might
have
in
an
administrative
action.
now,
is,
overton
park,
if
you
want
a
case.
is
that
a
possible
kind
of
review
that
you
might
find
appropriate
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
reason
that
you
would
apply
a
somewhat
higher
standard
is
because
the
rational
basis,
with
tremendous
deference,
applies
to
the
power
of
congress
to
act
in
an
economic
area
in
the
absence
of
a
particular
constitutional
provision
designed
to
protect
a
minority
from
the
actions
of
the
majority.
and
if
you
read
that
public
purpose
doctrine,
a
section
here
as
having
that
in
mind,
you
might
want
a
somewhat
higher
level
of
review.
now,
that's
the
whole
thing
spelled
out.
i'm
not
advocating
it.
but
i
am
putting
it
forward
to
get...
to
get
your
reaction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
and
indeed
with
equal
protection,
we
very
often
do
have
a
somewhat
higher
standard
of
review.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
be.
now,
that's
why
i'm
back
to
reasonableness.
you
see,
we
are
told
in
the
briefs
that
the
people
who
often
might
hold
out,
might
be
doing
so
to
get
more
money,
but
it
might
also
be
because
they
are
poor,
they
are
not
well
connected
politically,
and
their
only
hope
is
to
go
to
a
court
and
stop
this
thing.
so
you'd
give
them
two
weapons.
weapon
one
is
you
have
to
pay
them.
that's
correct.
compensation.
and
weapon
two
is
they
can
put
you
to
a
test
of
being
reasonable.
that
might
be
quite
a
deferential
test,
so
you
might
have
every
leg
up.
but
they
at
least
could
catch
the
instances
where
this
is
really
not
reasonable
to
do
to
them
what
you're
doing
to
them
that
they
don't
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
accepting
that
you
can't
make
that
kind
of
a
distinction.
that's
where
i'm
focusing
on
a
test
that
would
possibly
apply
only
where
you
transfer
property
from
one
private
person
to
another,
but
still
wouldn't
make
those
distinctions
of
blight
or
not
blight.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true.
but
now,
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
the
homeowner.
i
take
it,
if
it's
a
forced
sale,
it's
at
the
market
value,
the
individual,
let's
say
it's
someone
who
has
lived
in
his
house
his
whole
life.
he
bought
the
house
for
$50,000.
it's
worth
half
a
million.
he
has
450,000
profit.
he
pays
30
percent
to
the
government
and
the
state
in
taxes,
and
then
he
has
to
live
somewhere.
well,
i
mean,
what's
he
supposed
to
do?
he
now
has
probably
350,000
to
pay
for
a
house.
he
gets
half
a
house
because
that's
all
he
is
going
to
do,
all
he
is
going
to
get
for
that
money
after
he
paid
the
taxes,
or
whatever.
and
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of...
and
he
has
to
move
and
so
forth.
so
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
point,
is
there
some
way
of
assuring
that
the
just
compensation
actually
puts
the
person
in
the
position
he
would
be
in
if
he
didn't
have
to
sell
his
house?
or
is
he
inevitably
worse
off?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
remedy?
let's
repose
the
problem
to
which
i
want
to
remedy
then.
and
maybe
this
isn't
the
right
remedy.
but
the
remedy
that
they
are
saying,
and
i'm
really
repeating
it,
is
an
individual
has
a
house
and
they
want
to
be
really
not
made
a
lot
worse
off,
at
least
not
made
a
lot
worse
off
just
so
some
other
people
can
get
a
lot
more
money.
now
what,
what
is
the
right...
is
there
no
constitutional
protection?
if
this
isn't
the
right
case,
what
is?
