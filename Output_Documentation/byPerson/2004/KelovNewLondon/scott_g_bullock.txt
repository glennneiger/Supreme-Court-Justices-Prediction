mr.
scott
g.
bullock
justice
o'connor,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
whether
there
are
any
limits
on
government's
eminent
domain
power
under
the
public
use
requirement
of
the
fifth
amendment.
every
home,
church
or
corner
store
would
produce
more
tax
revenue
and
jobs
if
it
were
a
costco,
a
shopping
mall
or
a
private
office
building.
but
if
that's
the
justification
for
the
use
of
eminent
domain,
then
any
city
can
take
property
anywhere
within
its
borders
for
any
private
use
that
might
make
more
money
than
what
is
there
now.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
well,
your
honor,
it's
important
to
point
out
in
the
first
place
that
chapter
132
of
the
statutory
section
at
issue
here
applies
to
every
city
within
the
state
of
connecticut,
not
those
that
are
simply
depressed.
and
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
an
area
like
what
was
at
issue
in
berman,
an
area
that
actually
had
problems
and
a
city
that
has
certain
problems.
every
city
has
problems.
every
city
would
like
to
have
more
tax
revenue,
but
that
cannot
be
a
justification
for
taking
property--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--it
is
a
desire
to
try
to
improve
the
economy
through
tax
revenue
and
jobs.
that
is
certainly
the
case.
but
that
cannot
be
a
justification
for
the
use
of
eminent
domain
because
if
the
trickle
down
effects
of
economic
development
are
a
justification,
then
there
really
is
no
limit
on
the--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--that
is
not...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
do
not
concede
that.
and
chapter
132
again
applies
to
not
so
prosperous
cities
and
prosperous
cities.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
that
is
a
line
that
this
court
has
drawn
that
is
area
specific
that
focuses
on
the
conditions
in
a
particular
area.
and
the
condemnations
in
berman
removed
the
problematic
areas.
it
removed
the
blight.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
your
honor,
it
is
clear
that
eminent
domain
power
is
broad,
but
there
has
to
be
limits,
and
that's
what
we
are
really
talking
about
here.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
in
a
few
cases
from
earlier
in
this
century,
your
honor,
the
missouri
pacific
case,
the
thompson
versus
consolidated
gas
case,
but
this
court
has
recognized
for
over
200
years
that
there
are
limits
on
eminent
domain
power,
that
they
cannot
be
used
for
private
takings.
and
that
has
been
a
consistent
strain
throughout
this
court's
jurisprudence--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--well,
your
honor,
the
limit
is
that
there
cannot
be
takings
for
private
use.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
your
honor,
we
think
that
that
cuts
way
too
broadly.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
because
then
every
property,
every
home,
every
business
can
then
be
taken
for
any
private
use.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
well,
again,
the
eminent
domain
power
is
broad,
but
there
has
to
be
limits.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
well,
your
honor,
i
think
with
public...
with
just
having
a
simple
public
benefit,
then
there
really
is
no
distinction
between
public
and
private
uses.
and
that
is
what
we
call
upon
this
court
to
state,
for
instance,
in
the
berman
case
and
in
the
midkiff
case,
which
we
think
are
really
the
outer
limits
of
government's
eminent
domain--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--we
think
that
those
decisions
can
be
consistent
with
ruling
in
favor
of
petitioners
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
do
not--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
goes
to
whether
or
not
the
government
could
use
its
police
power
to
acquire
property
and
then
sell
it
to
a
private
developer.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
would
be...
it's
not
a
public
use.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
well,
your
honor,
because
this
case
affects
the
eminent
domain
power,
which
is
regulated
by
the
fifth
amendment--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--your
honor,
because
of
the
public
use
restriction
of
the
amendment.
that's
what
we
really--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
i'm
sorry--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--well,
your
honor,
this
court
did
hold
in
berman
and
midkiff
that
the
police
power
and
eminent
domain
power
are
coterminous.
that
was
a
holding
especially
of
this
court's
opinion
in
midkiff.
and
there
are
certain
amici
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
case
that
have
called
upon
this
court
to
reexamine
that.
and
of
course,
this
court
is
free
to
do
that.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
your
honor,
i
think
under
a...
perhaps
an
original
understanding
of
the
takings
clause,
there
was
a
difference
between
public
use
and
public
domain.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so,
because
of
the
caveat
in
berman
and
midkiff
that
eminent
domain
cannot
be
used
for
private
uses.
and
that
is
what
is
really
at
issue
here.
what
i
think
is
the
focus
of--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
justifications
focused
upon
the
removal
of
the
offensive
conditions
in
berman,
that
the
public
purpose,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
was
served
once
the
blight
was
removed,
the
public
purpose
was
served
once
the
oligopoly
was
broken
up.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
under
the
eminent
domain
authority,
your
honor,
we
think
that--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--yes.
and
we
think
that
that
is
a
line--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--exactly.
and
i
think
that
that
is
really
one
of
the
dangers
of
the
majority
opinion
here
is
that
it
puts
any
property
up
for
grabs.
under
the
blight
statutes,
they
actually
have
to...
governments
have
to
meet
a
certain
objective
criteria
to
satisfy
that
this
is
actually
a
blighted
area.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
well,
your
honor,
because,
i
think...
to
get
back
to
the
decisions
in
berman
and
midkiff,
what
this
court
i
think
focused
on
there
is
that
the
public
use
or
the
public
purpose
was
direct
and
immediate.
it
was
served
directly
by
the
condemnations
and
it
was
immediately
served
by
the
removal
of
the
blight
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
oligopoly.
in
economic
development
condemnations,
the
only
public
benefits
that
come
about,
if
they
come
about
at
all,
are
completely
dependent
upon
private
parties
actually
making
a
profit.
and
that
those
profits
then
somehow--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--but--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--well,
your
honor,
those
were
justified
under
i
think
the
line
of
cases
that
held
that
those
were
really
essential
for
land
assembly
for
instrumentalities
of
commerce.
they
were--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--your
honor,
there
are
many
ways
to
do
economic
development
without
condemnation.
it
happens
every
single
day
in
this
country.
and
in
the
states
that
prohibit
the
use
of
eminent
domain
simply
for
private
business
development,
those
states
do
make
the
distinction
between
blighted
areas
and
simply
their
communities
wanting
to
take
advantage
of
more
tax
revenue.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
court
in
berman
held
that
there
were
certain
properties
that
even
though
they
might
have
been
nonblighted,
it
was
essential
to
have
those
properties
in
order
to
remove
the
blight
from
the
area
that
was
at
issue.
so
there
was
the
ability
of
government
to
get
certain
properties
even
though
they
might
have
been
nonblighted.
here--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--well,
for
our
bright
line
rule,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
the
test
should
be
that
the
government
cannot
take
property
simply
so
that
the
new
owners
can
put
it
to
ordinary
private
uses
of
land.
that's
really
the
test.
and
the--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--true,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--well,
the
test,
your
honor,
for--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--yes.
yes.
when
it's
only
justified
in
order
to
gain
the
secondary
benefits
from
ordinary
private
uses
of
land,
and
the
way
that
businesses
always
make
use
of
their
land
to
try
to
make
money
or
to
try
to
make
a
profit.
that's
our
bright
line
rule.
but
for
our
second
test,
if
this
court
accepts
that
economic
development
can
be
a
public
use,
then
we
advocate
a
test
of
reasonably
foreseeable
uses
and
minimum
standards
in
order
to
counter
the
dangers
posed
by
such
private
involvement
in
the
use
of
eminent
domain
power.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
well,
the
dissent
in
the
connecticut
supreme
court
talked
a
lot
about
minimum
standards
that
should
be
in
place
in
order
to
ensure
that
public
benefits
actually
come
about.
those
could
be
such
things
as
a
commencement
date
for
the
project,
a
construction
schedule,
financial
eligibility
for
the
developers,
there's
a
number
of
different
things.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
not
particular
ones,
just
the
standard
actually
be
in
place
and
we
think
that
the
dissent
provides
some
good
guide
posts
for
establishing--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--no.
your
honor.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
no,
your
honor,
what
we
are
advocating
for,
and
utilities
of
course
are
justified,
have
long
been
justified
under
a
separate
line
of
cases,
common
carrier
regulations.
but
what
we
are
talking
about
are
certain
minimum
standards
in
place
at
the
time
of
condemnation
to
try
to
have
some
type
of
reasonable
certainty
that
the
public
benefits
are
to
come
about
so
we
are
not
talking
about
ongoing
oversight.
we
are
simply
talking
about
minimum
standards
at
the
time
of
the,
at
the
time
of
the
condemnation.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
procedure--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--yes,
your
honor.
and
there
is
a
number
of
reasons
why
there
has
to
be
reasonably
foreseeable
uses--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--well,
it
goes
to
the
doubt
about
whether
or
not
the
public
benefits
will
actually
come
about
in
this
case.
the
takings
here
are
really
for
speculative
purposes,
pure
speculative
purposes.
and
that's
where
the
minimum
standards
come
into
play
to
ensure--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--your
honor,
our
test
is
limited
really
to
the
condemnations
that
are
completely
dependent
upon
the
private
businesses
actually
being
successful,
and
that
those
benefits
coming
about
so
it
would
not
affect
utilities
or
anything
like
that.
but
at
a
minimum,
this
court
should
require
that
the
government
actually
name
a
use.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
it
is,
it
is
frequent,
your
honor.
there's
no...
we
do
not
know
of
any
study
that
looks
specifically
at
condemnations
for
economic
development,
but
after
the
michigan
court's
decision
in
poletown,
they
became
commonplace.
and
you
had
properties...
business
that
were
being
condemned
for
casinos,
other
homes
that
were
taken
for
automobile
manufacturers.
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
saw
that
as
a
disaster.
and
overturned
that.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
there
may
be
some
scholarship
about
that.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
property
owner
is
simply
entitled
to
just
compensation
of
the
appraised
value
of
the
property.
of
course,
the
property
owner--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
yes,
that
is
right.
and
so
they
simply
get
the--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--i
believe
there
has
been
some
scholarship
about
it,
but
we
think
it's
vital
that
there
be
a
public
use
requirement.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
yes.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
it's
similar
to
our
reasonable
foreseeability
test
that
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
this
court
actually
talked
about
in
the
vester
case
as
well,
and
a
number
of
the
other
state
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
that
establish
that
there
has
to
be
a
use
for
the
property
and
that
that
use
has
to
be
reasonably
perceived.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
no,
there's
not.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
i
think
it
will
provide
important
minimal
standards
of
protection
for--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--your
honor,
i
think
just
the
standard
needs
to
be
in
place.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
exactly.
or
at
the
very
least,
a
reasonable
foreseeability
as
well,
which
is
at
a
minimum
that
is
not
even
in
place
in
this
particular
case.
and
the
majority
of
state
courts
that
have
looked
at
this,
that
is
a--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
right.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
it
should
be
done
where
the
property
is
actually
being
condemned.
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
proper--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--in
this
particular
parcel,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
has
been
supported
by
really
just
about
every
condemnation
decision--
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
--your
honor,
because
that
does
not
really
provide
any
protection
to
property
owners.
the
intent
to
benefit
a
private
party,
and
the
intent
to
benefit
the
public
are
really
one
and
the
same
in
these
types
of
condemnations.
and
we
believe
it
is
imperative
at
a
minimum
because
the
condemnations
are
dependent
upon
private
parties
even
being
successful
that
there
has
to
be
reasonable
foreseeable
uses.
and
also,
if
this
court
so
chooses,
minimum
standards
in
place
to
ensure
that
those
benefits
actually
go
to
the
public.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
scott
g.
bullock
i
wish
i
did.
i
could
respond
to
it
if
i...
if
i
actually
did.
your
honors,
first
of
all,
just
a
couple
of
matters
regarding
the
connecticut
supreme
court's
decision.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
did
not
apply
the
test
that
we
suggest
in
our
case,
they
explicitly,
the
majority
explicitly
declined
to
apply
heightened
scrutiny
in
this,
in
this
instance.
i
think
the
key
to
understanding
their
argument
is
the
answer
to
the
question
of,
can
you
take
a
motel
6
and
give
it
to
a
fancier
hotel?
their
answer
is
yes.
and
that's
what's
really
at
stake
here.
these
condemnations
are
taking
place
throughout
the
country.
a
city
in
california
condemns
the
99
cents
store
in
order
to
give
it
to
costco.
now,
were
they
giving
enormous
benefits
to
costco?
of
course
they
were.
but
they
did
so
because
they
wanted
to
get
the
tax
revenue,
and
that's
the
problem
with
these
types
of
condemnations,
the
desire
to
help
a
private
party
and
the
desire
to
help
the
public
are
really
one
and
the
same.
the
public
only
benefits
if
the
private
party
is
successful.
all
right,
the
nldc
is
a
private
body.
it
has
a
private
board
of
directors,
and
it
is
leasing
land
to
a
private
developer
for
99
years
at
$1
a
year.
that
is
private
ownership
of
land.
also,
your
honors,
there
is
no
severe
assembly
problem
in
this
particular
case,
and
in
many
other
development
situations.
the
nldc
and
the
city
have
32
acres
that
was
given
to
them
by
the
federal
government
for
them
to
do
as
they
wish.
and
our
homeowners
who
have
lived
there
a
long
time
and
wish
to
hold
on
to
their
properties
do
not
object
to
that
development
going
on.
it
is
within
the
rights
of
the
city
and
the
nldc
to
do
so.
also,
your
honor,
the
rindge
case
that
was
cited
by
the
respondents,
they
actually
knew
what
was
going
to
go
on
in
that,
in
that
case.
they
knew
what
the
use
was
going
to
be.
and
finally,
your
honors,
the
respondents
talk
about
the
effect
that
this
may
have
upon
poor
people.
not
all
neighborhoods,
not
all
poor
neighborhoods
are
blighted.
but
the
one
thing
that
all
poor
neighborhoods
share
in
common
is
that
they
don't
produce
much
in
the
way
of
tax
revenue,
so
you're
going
to
put
poor
neighborhoods
and
working
class
neighborhoods
like
the
ones
that
exist
in
fort
trumbull
in
jeopardy
if
the
court
affirms
the
decision
below.
and
that's
why
so
many
organizations
that
are
concerned
about
the
rights
of
senior
citizens
and
the
rights
of
minorities
and
poor
folks
like
legal
services
corporations
have
joined
in
our
side
to
support
the
property
owners
in
this
case.
if
there
is
no
further
questions,
your
honors,
i
will
close.
thank
you.
