mr.
bullock,
you
are
leaving
out
that
new
london
was
in
a
depressed
economic
condition,
so
this
is
distinguished
from
the
case
where
the
state
has
no
particular
reason
for
wanting
this,
but
the
critical
fact
on
the
city
side,
at
least,
is
that
this
was
a
depressed
community
and
they
wanted
to
build
it
up,
get
more
jobs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
concede
that
on
the
facts,
more
than
tax
revenue
was
at
stake.
that
is,
the
community
had
gone
down
and
down
and
the
town
wanted
to
build
it
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
line
you
draw
is
between
blight,
which
berman
says
was
a
legitmate
public
use,
blighted
conditions
okay,
but
depressed
conditions,
not
so
that's
the
line
we
would
draw--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
though
in
berman,
there
was
a
department
store
that
was
not
blighted,
and
it
was
permissible
because
the
whole
area
was
to
be
improved
to
raze
that
department
store,
even
though
it
wasn't
contributing
in
any
way
to
blight.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
you
do
that
area
by
area?
i
mean,
one
of
the
points
you
made,
this
is
divided
into
what,
seven
areas?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
not
the
area
development
but
this
house,
will
there
be...
is
it
reasonably
likely
that
there
will
be
development
in
that
particular
plot.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
what
the
connecticut
supreme
court
that
we
are
reviewing
said,
you...
you
are
arguing,
it
seems
to
me,
for
something
that
goes
beyond
what
was
adjudicated
in
this
case.
i
mean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
a
finding,
a
finding
before
to
be
a
fact
in
the
trial
court
that
this
development
was
going
to
be
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
citizens
of
new
london,
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
pfizer
or
the
private
developer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
much,
how
much
of
this
was
voluntarily
sold,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
think
you'd
have
to
take
some
substantial
chunks
of
language
out
of
berman
as
well,
because
justice
douglas
spoke
very
expansively
in
that
case.
