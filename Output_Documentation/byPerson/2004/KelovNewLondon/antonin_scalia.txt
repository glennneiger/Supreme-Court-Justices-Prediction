you
don't
concede,
or
do
you,
that
elevating
a
city
from
a
depressed
to
prosperous
is
a
better
justification
than
elevating
a
city
from
prosperous
to
more
prosperous?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bullock,
do
you
equate
purpose
with
use?
are
the
two
terms
the
same?
does
the
public
use
requirement
mean
nothing
more
than
that
it
have
a
public
purpose?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
answer
to
justice
souter.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
in
effect
changing
the
test
from
public
use
to
efficient
public
use?
i
mean,
what's...
you
know,
if
i
condemn
land
for
a
public
utility
and
the
public
utility
turns
out
to
be
very
inefficient,
has
the
condemnation
been
invalid?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
us
to
sit
here
and
evaluate
the
prospects
of
each
condemnation
one
by
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
horton,
what,
what
difference
does
it
make
that,
that
new
london
was
in
an
economic
depression?
would
it
not
be
fully
as
much,
under
your
theory
of
a
public
use,
for
a
city
to
say,
yes,
we
are
not
doing
badly,
but
we
could
do
better.
let's
attract
some
high
tech
industry
here.
you
can't
possibly
draw
a
line
between
depressed
cities
and
undepressed
cities,
can
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't.
and
you
wouldn't
ask
us
to
do
it
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
city
can
do
it.
and
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
souter
gave
earlier
where,
you
know,
you
couldn't
take
it
from
a
and
give
it
to
b,
because
b
is
a
good
democrat,
you
could
take
it
from
a
and
give
it
to
b
if
b
is
richer,
and
would
pay
higher
municipal
taxes,
couldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
just
want
to
take
property
from
people
who
are
paying
less
taxes
and
give
it
to
people
who
are
paying
more
taxes.
that
would
be
a
public
use,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
qualify
it.
you
can
take
from
a
to
give
to
b
if
b
pays
more
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
accept
that.
you
can
take
from
a
and
give
to
b
if
b
pays
significantly
more
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
accept
that
as
a
proposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
factual
finding?
you
consider
that
a
factual
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
this
is
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
city
of
new
london,
not
for
the
benefit
of
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
eye
of
the
beholder,
to
whom
do
you
think
this
does
greater
benefit
to,
not
a
factual
finding.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
horton,
you're
paying
for
it,
but
you're
also
taking
property
from
somebody
who
doesn't
want
to
sell
it.
does
that
count
for
nothing?
yes,
you're
paying
for
it,
but
you're
giving
the
money
to
somebody
who
doesn't
want
the
money,
who
wants
to
live
in
the
house
that
she's
lived
in
her
whole
life.
that
counts
for
nothing?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
let
me
ask...
would,
would
the
reasonableness
standard,
if
the
project
is
indeed
reasonable,
and
there
is
genuine
prospect
that
all
of
these
good
things
that
you're
talking
about
will
happen,
why
wouldn't
private
money
come
in
to
further
the
project?
why
is
it
necessary
to
condemn
it
if
it's
so
reasonable.
why
couldn't
you,
you...
now,
you
say
there
is
a
holdout
for
one
part,
parcel.
couldn't
the
city
fund
a
private
purchase
of
that
parcel?
say,
you
know,
we'll
make
funds
available
out
of
our
general
tax
revenue
to
somebody
who
wants
to
come
in
and
put
together
this
system?
of
course,
that
person
has
to
buy
out
property
owners,
but
we'll,
we'll
give
you
money
to
buy
them
out
at
high
prices.
justice
antonin
scalia
common
carriers
are
subject
to
state
regulation
to
a
degree
that
private
companies
are
not.
they
must,
they
must
treat
all
comers
alike.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
the
public
utility
cases
are
at
all
comparable
to
condemning
land
in
order
to
get
a
new
company
to
move
in
and
pay
more
taxes.
i
just
don't
think
it's
similar.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
really
overrule
a
bunch
of
prior
cases
and
really
throw
condemnation
law
into
chaos.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
know,
in
any
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
this
lady
wants
is
not
more
money.
no
amount
of
money
is
going
to
satisfy
her.
she
is
living
in
this
house,
you
know,
her
whole
life
and
she
does
not
want
to
move.
she
said
i'll
move
if
it's
being
taken
for
a
public
use,
but
by
god,
you're
just
giving
it
to
some
other
private
individual
because
that
individual
is
going
to
pay
more
taxes.
i...
it
seems
to
me
that's,
that's
an
objection
in
principle,
and
an
objection
in
principle
that
the
public
use
requirement
of
the
constitution
seems
to
be
addressed
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
the
first
of
holmes'
decisions
to
be
overruled.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
horton,
i'm
not
proposing
that
the
state
has
to
use
the
property
itself.
i'm
simply
proposing
that
its
use
not
be
a
private
use
which
has
incidental
benefits
to
the
state.
that
is
not
enough
to
justify
use
of
the
condemnation
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
give
it
to
a
private
entity,
you
can
give
it
to
a
railroad,
to
some
public
utility.
but
the
use
that
it's
put
to
by
that
railroad
and
public
utility
is
a
public
use.
that's
why
it's
a
public
utility.
it's
quite
different
to
say
you
can
give
it
to
a
private
individual
simply
because
that
private
individual
is
going
to
hire
more
people
and
pay
more
taxes.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
just
washes
out
entirely
the
distinction
between
private
use
and
public
use.
