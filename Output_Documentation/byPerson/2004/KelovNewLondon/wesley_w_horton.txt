mr.
wesley
w.
horton
justice
o'connor,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
purpose
of
the
takings
clause
is
to
provide
for
just
compensation.
now,
i
want
to
very
briefly
state
two
reasons
why
you
do
not
want
to
make
a--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
i
completely
agree
with
that,
but
if
the
primary
purpose
of
the
takings
clause
is
not
to
regulate
legislative
determinations
of
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
opposition
is
asking
for
is
two
tests.
one
for
berman
and
midkiff
and
national
railroad,
and
another
test
for
kelo.
there
is
no
principle
basis
for
a
court
to
make
what
is
really
a
value
judgment
about
whether
a
long
term
plan
to
revive
an
economically
depressed
city
is
a
public
use
of
a
higher
or
lower
rank
constitutionally--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--yes,
justice
breyer.
and
i
noted
his
remark
because
that's
actually
in
concession
because
that's
the
test
the
connecticut
supreme
court
imposed.
and
they
have--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--i
don't,
i
don't
agree.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
do
that,
because
if
you
have
that
test,
you
have
to
say,
well,
what
do
i
do
about,
about
other
areas
than
this.
berman
is
an
excellent
example
of
that,
because
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
mr.
berman's
property
was
not
blighted.
you
needed
to
take
mr.
berman's
property
in
order
for
the
economic
development
that
was
going
to
occur
later
on.
and
the
question
is,
was
it
reasonably
assured
that
the
economic
development...
in
fact,
some
of
the
other
side's
amicus
briefs
say
that
that
worked
out
terribly
down
there,
and
all
it
was
was
discriminating
against
the
poor
and,
and
poverty
stricken
people
and
it
didn't
accomplish
any
goal--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--i
would
not
draw
a
line.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
i
would
not
ask...
i
have
a
backup
argument
that
you
do
not
need
to
reach
that
issue
here
in
light
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
but
i...
to
be
candid
with
you,
my
view
is
that
the
test
you
have
is...
there
is
no
principle--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--yes,
your
honor.
but
i
have
a
caveat
on
that.
if
you're
talking
about
one
property,
you're
very
likely
to
have
a
willowbrook
versus
oleck
problem
about
discrimination,
you
know,
intentional
discrimination
against
somebody
else's
property.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
yes,
your
honor.
that
would
be
okay.
i...
because
otherwise
you're
in
the
position
of
drawing
the
line.
i
mean,
there
is,
there
is
a
limit.
i
mean--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--no.
i
don't
agree
with
that.
a
good
example
is...
well,
there
is
missouri
pacific.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
there
is
some
force
to
it.
i
certainly
wouldn't--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--if
it's
a
significant
amount.
obviously,
there
is
a
cost--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--with
that--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
i'm
sorry.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
yes.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
yes,
your
honor.
i
do.
and
to--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--your
honor,
in
berman,
the...
what
has--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--your
honor,
my
position
is
that
purely
taking
from
one
person
to
give
to
another
that
shows
no
public
benefit
other
than
just
giving
from...
taking
from
one
person
to
another
would
not
be
a
public
use.
a
good
example
is
the
missouri
pacific
case.
the
one
case
in
200
years
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
where
you
have,
in
fact,
struck
such
a
taking
that
was
not
a
regulatory
taking.
i
would
also
point
out
that
there
are
a
few
cases
around
the
country
where
it
does
not
include
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
about
additional
taxes.
an
excellent
example
of
that
is
the
case
the
other
side
has
cited
from
new
jersey.
casino
properties
versus
bannon,
where
the
trump
association
just
wanted
a
parking
lot
that
was
next
door.
there
was
no
assembly
problem.
no
problem
putting
small
parcels
together.
there
was
no
talk
in
the
case
about
taxes
or
more
taxes
or
more
jobs
or
anything.
it...
the
trial
judge
there
didn't
say
it
was
just
for
a
public
purpose...
a
private
purpose,
but
he
said
it
was
overwhelmingly
just
for
the
trump
organization's...
so,
i
mean,
if
you
include
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
about
more
taxes,
then
i
say
that's
sufficient,
as
long
as
you
get
over--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--yes.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
yes,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
that
and
that
is
why
i
say
my
backup
position
is
you
don't
need
to
determine
whether
you
go
beyond
economic
depression
of
a
city
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
i
think
it's
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--i
consider
that--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--well,
for
one
thing
we
have
in
this
case,
and
this
comes
back
to
the
point
about
this
particular
case,
is
a
severe
assembly
problem.
we
have
115
properties
we
are
talking
about
on
this
90-acre
plot,
and
there
is
32
acres
that
come
from
one
place,
from--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
it's
a
long
range
plan.
if
i
could
have,
if
i
could
have
the
chart,
please,
if
i
may
show
you
your
honor.
the...
we
are
out
on
a
peninsula
here,
and
here
is
pfizer
down
here,
which
at
the
time
of
the
taking
was
almost
completed.
they
moved
in
a
month
afterwards.
up
here
is
an
old
state...
old
fort
from
the
19th
century
that
the
state
agreed
to
turn
into
a
state
park
as
part
of
an
overall
plan.
the
overall
plan
is
this
whole
thing.
now,
parcel
one
is
going
to
be
a
hotel,
is
planned
for
a
hotel.
parcel
two
was
planned--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--yes.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
yes.
that's
right.
they
are
in
parcel
3
and
they
are
in
parcel
4-a.
now,
the...
it's
to
be
developed
in
phases.
the
first
phase
is
one
and
two.
the
next
phase
is
then
three
and
four,
a,
and
there
is
also
a
marina--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--what's
planned
for
3
is
that
it's
going
to
be
office
space.
and
the
expectation
is
there
is
going
to
be
a
demand
for
class
a
office
space,
which
is
the
best
quality
office
space
in
this
area
by
2010.
and
the
expectation
is
that
it
will
attract
the
sorts
of
offices
that
will
feed
on
the
pfizer.
they
spent
$300
million
on
a
site
here.
in
addition,
i
may
point
out,
this
is
the
amtrak
line
going
along
here.
the
only
way
you
can
get
to
parcels
1
and
2
is
to
go
right
by
parcel
3
or
go
right
by
parcel
4-a.
this
is
a
waste
water
treatment
facility.
parcel
4-a
is
for
park
support
or
marina
support.
now,
it
isn't
more
definitive,
but
obviously,
one
possible
use
is
for
parking
here
because
you've
got
a
waste
water
treatment
facility
here.
you've
got
the
park
here.
you've
got
the
marina
here
and
you've
got
the
other
parcels
here.
it's
not
like
we
are
talking,
as
in
berman,
you're
talking
about
something
that's
in
the
parcel.
and
in
berman,
they
said
it's
not
for
the
court
to
decide
where
the
boundary
lines
ought
to
be.
it
seems
to
me
that's
another
point,
justice
o'connor.
it's
not
like
parcel
3
is
already--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
no,
your
honor,
if
what
you're
defining
as
reasonableness
is
being
higher
than
rational
basis.
because
in
that
situation,
you're
applying
a
higher
standard
for
a
taking
where
we
are
paying
for
it
than
you
would
be
for--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--your
honor,
that
same
type
of
remark
could
be
made
about
rational
basis
equal
protection
review.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
ah,
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
point
here
is
that
you
should
not
have
a
higher
standard
of
review
because
we
are
paying
for
it.
it
would
be
ironic
to
have
a
higher
test
than
for
example
in
a
regulatory
taking
or
even
the
same
test.
you
have
a
test
in
nollan
and
dolan,
for
example,
which
is
an
exactions
case.
so
that's
to
say--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--no,
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
your
honor,
there
are
some
plaintiffs
who
are
not
going
to
sell
at
any
price.
they
want
to
stay
there.
you've
got
a
severe
assembly
problem
in
this
case
and
it's
not
as
though
you
can
say,
well,
go
somewhere
else.
you
have
a
situation
where
you've
got
the
pfizer
plant
that
is
being
built
there.
you've
got
the
state
park
that's
there.
you've
got
this
naval
underseas
facility
that
just
came
on
the
market.
that's
the
only
place
anything
is
going
to
work
and
it's...
and
it's
five
to
six
square
miles
of
town.
i
mean,
there
is
no
other
place
to
go.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
the
large
share
of
it
was,
but
of
course,
that's
because
there
is
always
in
the
background
the
possibility
of
being
able
to
condemn
it.
i
mean,
that
obviously
facilitates
a
lot
of
voluntary
sales.
and
if,
if
this
is
not...
if
this
is
not...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
mean,
there
is
going
to
be
a
more
severe
holdout
problem.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
i
have
two
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
that
applies
to
all
sorts
of
takings.
if
i'm
building
a
road,
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
the
rindge
case
that
your
honors
decided
in
the
1920s.
that
was
the
road
to
nowhere.
it
was
a
road
that
went
through
a
farm
to
the
county
line.
and
the
other
county
had
no
intention
at
that
point
of
building
a
road,
but
your
honors
said,
well,
they
might
get
around
to
it
at
sometime
so
it's
a
good
idea
to
build
it
now.
we
had
a
similar
situation
in
hartford.
there
is
supposed
to
be
a
ring
road
around
hartford,
and
the
state
condemned
all
this
land
for
a
ring
road
around
hartford.
well,
one
little
bit
of
it
was
done
and
then
just
this,
this
year,
in
very
low
print
in
the
last
page
of
the
newspaper,
we
see
about
the
state
getting
around
to
selling
the
land
because
they
didn't,
they
didn't
do
it.
i
mean,
this
can
happen
in
the
railroad
case
is
a
good
example.
the
railroad
case.
the
one
your
honors
decided.
if
it's...
being
a
common
carrier
makes
all
the
difference,
then
how
come
the
icc
just
didn't
order
the
boston
&
maine
to
fix
the
railroad?
you
know.
why?
you
know,
you
didn't
look
to
make
a--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--well,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the...
there
is
a
difference,
the
whole
point
is
about
having
a
test
about
reasonable
assurances
about
whether
something
is
going
to
happen
and
that's
where
the
railroad
case
makes
a
difference.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
that's
the
only
point
i
was
making,
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
to
go
further
than
that.
but
coming
back
to
justice
breyer's
point,
you
made
a
point
about
poor
people.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out,
unless
you're
going
to
overrule
berman,
you
know,
poor
people
and
minorities
are
more
likely
to
be
vulnerable
in
the
blight
cases
than
in
this
case.
i
mean,
this
is
a
good
example.
economic
development
can
take
place
anywhere
in
town.
blight
happens
in
one
area
of
town
where
the
poor
and
the
minorities
are
likely
to
live,
and
in
fact,
this
very
case,
we
have
got
middle
class
people.
there
is
no
blight
that's
been
alleged
in
the
condemnation
papers.
the
other
thing
is
if
you
stick
to
blight,
this
is
the
problem
you're
going
to
have.
you're
going
to
end
up
making
a
blight
jurisprudence
because...
because
what's
going
to
happen
is
the
cities
are
going
to
say,
we
can
only
do
this
by
blight,
so
they
are
going
to
have
marginal
definitions
of
blight.
florida,
for
example,
says
property
is
blighted
if
it's
vacant.
is
that
blight?
i
mean,
you're
going
to
have
a
big
headache
in
that--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--yes.
but
i
mean,
the
other
thing
is,
are
you
going
to
make...
would
the
court
make
a
distinction
between
a
case
where
the
city
is
doing
the
developing
itself,
and
another
case
where
the
city
gives
it
to
a
private
person.
i'd
like
to
point
out,
my
client
is
going
to
keep
the
property.
it's...
it's
going
to
be
leased
to
a
developer.
it's
not
going
to
be
sold
to
the
developer.
so
i
mean,
if
this
developer
builds
a
building
on
this
property,
and
then
doesn't
comply,
they
are
in
big
trouble.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
well,
that's
an
interesting
point.
a
question
was
raised
earlier
about
the
other
side
about
whether
there
should
be--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--the
compensation
measures.
exactly.
by
the
way,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
if
there
is
some...
if
there
is
some
scholarly
articles
on
that,
i'm
not
aware
of
it
either.
but
i
would
point
out
that's
something,
you
know,
in
terms
of
social
costs
and
things
like
that,
that
is
something
that
this
court
might
or
might
not
wish
to
consider
in
a
just
compensation
case,
but
i
don't
think
it
should
affect
whether
you
take
the
property
or
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
is...
i'm
not
taking
a
position
on
that
one
way
or
another,
but
it
seems
to
me
that's...
you
have
to
assume
in
this
case
that
there
is
going
to
be
just
compensation.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
under...
under
state
law?
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
the
state
does
not
pay
attorneys'
fees,
your
honor.
everybody
pays
his
own
attorneys'...
and
likewise,
the
other
way,
if
it's
lower
amount
than
what
was
put
in
than,
you
know,
it's
not
as
though
the
state
gets
attorneys'
fees
back.
it
works
both
ways.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
i
think
there
is
two
good
reasons
for
it,
and
that
it's
a
theoretical
more
than
a
practical
problem.
first
of
all,
you've
got
all
sorts
of
transaction
costs
when
you,
when
you
go
through
eminent
domain,
as
opposed
to
doing
things
voluntarily.
so
you
are
not
going
to
do
things...
yes,
as
a
practical
matter,
to
take
justice
scalia's
earlier
example,
for
one
piece
of
property
because
of
the
transaction
costs
involved.
i
mean,
you're
never
going
to
make
up...
unless
it's
to,
you
know,
to
favor
the
governor's
friend
or
something
like
that,
as
you
say.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
in
which
case
you
have
a
different
problem.
the
willowbrook
versus
oleck
test.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
transaction
costs,
but
that
is
a
serious
problem.
and
the
other
thing,
there
is
the
democratic
process,
your
honor.
i
mean,
especially
if
the
taxpayers
are
paying
for
something
and
you
know,
they
are
getting
a
bad
reason
or
run
around
about
the
reason,
you
know,
that's
subject
to
review.
it
seems
to
me
democracy
can
make
good
decisions
and...
or
bad
decisions
under
the
constitution,
but
the
important
thing
is
that
when
it's
paid
for,
it's
not
like
regulatory
takings
which
are,
you
know,
the
taxpayers
don't
see
that
until
it's
too
late.
you
know,
in
this
type
of
taking,
the
taxpayers
are
seeing
up
front
what's
going
on.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
well,
i
mean,
first
of
all,
the...
in
connecticut,
fortunately,
we
have
relocation
loans
which
are
involved
here.
and
they
are
available
in
this
case.
there
was,
it
wasn't
clear
from
our
brief
whether
they
were
loans
or
not,
and
it
is
correct
that
they
are
loans.
the
other
side
pointed
out
that
that
was
for
all
projects
in
the
state.
that's
not
true,
you
know,
i
mean,
there
is
$10
million
involved
in
relocation
funds.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
that's
true.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
yes.
and
that's,
and
i
had
said
that
earlier.
but
another
point
when
i
was
talking
about
roads
is
that
applies
to...
that
could
apply
to
any
type
of
case.
it
doesn't
just
apply
to
a
case
like
this.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
yes.
and
justice
scalia,
a
question
you...
or
actually
it
was
a
comment
you
had
made
about
public
use
versus
public
purpose.
and
that
would
not
only
overrule...
and
my
opposing
counsel
said
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two.
and
when
pressed
by
justice
souter...
and
i
would
point
out,
that's
just
overruling
cases
going
back
to
berman.
that's
overruling
two
decisions
by--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--well,
the
right
case
is
in
the
just
compensation
concept,
but
going
to
your,
your
point,
if
this
were
here
as
just
compensation,
i
would
say
in
terms
of
just
compensation,
in
deciding
what
the
fair
market
value
is
today,
you
can
certainly
take
into
account
the
economic
plan
that's
going
into
effect.
you
know--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--well--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--i
may
have
misspoken
on
that
subject,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
i--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--but
as
i
say,
your
honor,
if
public
use
and
public
purpose
are
the
same
thing,
which
they
are
unless
you're
going
to
overrule
holmes'
decisions
from
1905
and
1906.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
plus
i
think
holmes
was
right
when
he
said
that
to
say
that
the
public
actually
has
to
use
the
property
is
not
an
appropriate
meaning
of
the
phrase,
so
i
would
not
think
you'd
want
to
revisit
that
case,
even
if
you
want
to
revisit
some
other
of
holmes'
decisions.
but
the...
i
guess
the
best
answer
i
have,
justice
breyer,
to
your
question,
after
i,
after
i
misspoke
is
simply
to
go
back
to
the
point
that
the
time
at
which
you
consider
what
just
compensation
is,
is
in
the
just
compensation
proceedings.
and
while
i
misspoke
about
what
the
test
was,
and
i
apologize
for
that,
certainly
this
court
can
consider
if
social
costs
should
be
taken
into
account
at
that
time.
i'm
not
saying
they
should.
i
haven't
thought
that
through
as
can
you
obviously
see
by
my
misanswering
the
question,
but
it
seems
to
me
because
my
primary
answer
is
that
you
don't
look
at
that
now.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
yes,
it
does.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
yes.
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
wesley
w.
horton
--well,
i
don't
agree,
your
honor,
because
i
think,
you
know,
i
think
if
a
person
is
without
a
job
and
if
a
person
is
not
able
to
get
basic
services
that
they
need
from
the
town
because
the
town
can't
afford
it,
that's
just
as
important
as
a
trains
running
on
time
or
eliminating
blight.
and
justice
breyer,
i
thought
of
another
answer
to
your
question
that
has
to
do
with
this
case.
and
that
is
even
on
a
higher
test,
we
win
because
the
connecticut
supreme
court
applied
a
higher
test
in
this
case.
and
just...
i
would
say
that
in
this
case,
the
essence
of
federalism
is
to
let
various
courts
make
various
decisions
about
what
they
consider
an
important
public
purpose.
it
may
be
different
in
utah
from
the
way
it
is
in
connecticut,
and
it's
different
in
florida,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
should
be
having
a
new
jurisprudence
for
this
area
and
having
two
separate
tests,
and
maybe
having
a
test
that
even
approaches
the
nollan
dolan
test
where
you
certainly
want
to
discourage
people
from
taking
these
actions.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
the
four
words
i
think
that
this
court
should
consider...
and
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
the
four
words
since
my
red
light
is
on.
thank
you,
your
honor.
