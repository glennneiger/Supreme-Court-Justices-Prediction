justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
the
case
of
kelo
vs.
city
of
new
london.
mr.
bullock.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
but
berman
spoke,
in
the
opinion,
said
that
the
determination
of
the
legislature
about
these
things
is
virtually
conclusive,
that
there
is
only
the
narrowest,
narrowest
role
for
the
judiciary.
what
kind
of
standard
are
you
proposing
we
should
get
into
here
to
second
guess
the
public
use
aspect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
have
we
ever
in
any
case
from
this
court
said
that
the
limit
has
been
exceeded?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
think
those
were
correctly
decided
or
do
you
take
issue
with
the
decision
in
those
two
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
take
the
position
that
a
city
that
is
suffering
from
enormous
lack
of
jobs
and
depression,
economic
depression,
that
there
is
no
public
use
purpose
for
taking
land
to
enable
the
creation
of
jobs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bullock,
would
you
articulate
the
test
that
you
would
propose
the
court
adopt.
some
amici
and
others
have
argued
that
we
should
use
the
substantially
advances
test,
so
called
test
from
regulatory
takings.
what
tests
do
you
articulate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
not
what's
asserted
here,
of
course.
here
the
city
says,
we
are
doing
this
for
purposes
of
enhancing
economic
development
of
a
very
poor
city.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
do
we
do
with
that
alleged
purpose?
what
is
your
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
no
economic
development
purpose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
really
want
courts
to
be
in
the
business
of
trying
to
weigh
the
evidence
to
see
if
the
utility
will
be
successful
or
the
hospital
will
be
successful
or
the
road
will
be
well
constructed?
i
mean,
what
kind
of
a
test
are
you
proposing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
how
often
takings
by
eminent
domain
for
economic
development
occur
in
this
country?
is
it
frequent?
what
are
we
dealing
with?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there's
some
scheduled
to
be
developed
first,
you
say
that
your
clients
lived
in
parcels
that
are
not
likely
to
be
developed
soon,
if
at
all.
so
when
making
this
determination,
is
development
reasonably
likely,
do
you
have
to
do
it
parcel
by
parcel
or
can
it
be
with
the
whole--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--very
well.
mr.
horton.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
has
to
be
for
a
valid
public
use.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
example,
motel
6
and
the
city
thinks,
well,
if
we
had
a
ritz-carlton,
we
would
have
higher
taxes.
now,
is
that
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when,
when
there
is
no
condemnation
to
acquire
property
for
the
direct
use
of
the
public,
as
for
a
public
right
of
way,
or
a
utility
path
or
something,
where
it's
purely
economic
development,
is
there
any
reason
why
we
shouldn't
draw
a
clear
line
and
say
that
isn't
a
public
purpose.
let
them
go
out
and
deal
with...
buy
it
on
the
market,
on
the
open
market.
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
look
at
the
specifics
here.
pfizer
is
already
in
place.
that's
happened.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
are
these
parcels
of
the
people
now
before
us
going
to
be
used
for?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let's
talk
about
the
litigants.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
before
us
today.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
planned
for
3
and
4-a?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bullock,
you
have
three
and
a
half
minutes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
case
is
submitted.
