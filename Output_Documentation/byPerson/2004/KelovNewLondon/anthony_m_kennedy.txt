but
that's
what
they
were
being
used
for
in
berman
and...
everybody
knows
that
private
developers
were
the
beneficiaries
in
berman.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
i
understand,
you're
testing...
you
want
me
to
make
a
distinction
between
blight
which
is
a
permissible
governmental
use,
governmental
objective
and
economic
revival,
which
isn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
the
line
you
want
me
to
draw.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
an
economist
or
even
the
judge
might
say,
well,
it's
very
clear
that
if
this
economic
depression
continues
for
another
five
years
we
are
going
to
have
blight.
blight
is
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder,
i
know
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
it
an
objective
criteria
to
say
that
we
are
going
to
have
economic
revival,
avoid
economic
downturns?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
same
thing
that
is
true
in
the
railroads
in
the
west.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
precisely
the
description
you
gave
applied
to
the
railroads
in
the
west.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
all
of
those
cases,
i
think
the
economic
feasibility
or
economic
success
test
would
have
been
easily
met.
i
mean,
what
you're
doing
is
trying
to
protect
some
economic
value/but
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
most
economists
would
say
this
development
wouldn't
happen
unless
there
is
a
foreseeable
chance
of
success.
let
me
ask
you
this,
and
it's
a
little
opposite
of
the
particular
question
presented.
are
there
any
writings
or
scholarship
that
indicates
that
when
you
have
property
being
taken
from
one
private
person
ultimately
to
go
to
another
private
person,
that
what
we
ought
to
do
is
to
adjust
the
measure
of
compensation,
so
that
the
owner...
the
condemnee...
can
receive
some
sort
of
a
premium
for
the
development?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
have
to
prescind
the
project
when
you
fix
the
value.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
to
prescind
the
project...
you
have
to...
you
have
to
ignore
the
project
when
you
determine
the
value.
the
value
is
a
willing
buyer
and
a
willing
seller,
without
reference
to
the
project.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
i
am
asking
is
if
there
has
been
any
scholarship
to
indicate
that
maybe
that
compensation
measure
ought
to
be
adjusted
when
a
is
losing
property
for
the
economic
benefit
of
b.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
that,
if
that's
so
then
the
occasional
statements
that
we
see
in
the
writing
that
you
can't
take
from
a
to
give
to
b
is
just
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
you
can't
take
from
a
to
give
to
b,
that
there
is
some
substance
and
force
to
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
without
the
addition,
i'd
please
like
an
answer
to
your
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
statements
in
our
cases
that
say
you
cannot
take
from
a
just
to
give
to
b.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
there
is
substance
to
that
proposition
and
that
that
proposition
is
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
that
exactly
what
happened
in
berman?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
that
exactly
what
always
happens
unless
it's
for
a
firehouse
or
a
school?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
does
seem
ironic
that
100
percent
of
the
premium
for
the
new
development
goes
to
the,
goes
to
the
developer
and
to
the
taxpayers
and
not
to
the
property
owner.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
compensation
measures.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
that
point,
just
in
connecticut,
if
the
property
owner
goes
to
the
jury
and
receives
more
than
the
state
offered,
does
the
state
also
have
to
pay
those
attorneys'
fees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
connecticut
law,
if
the
property
owner
is
offered
$100
but
goes
to
the
jury
and
gets
$200,
does
the
property
owner
have
to
pay
the
attorneys'
fees
or
does
the
state
pay
the
attorneys'
fees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
really?
i
thought
that
that
was
a
fundamental
of
condemnation
law
that
you
can
not
value
the
property
being
taken
based
on
what
it's
going
to
be
worth
after
the
project.
that's
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--unless
connecticut
law
is
much
different
from
any
other
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
the
tax
code
does
have
special
provisions
for
involuntary
sales
and
reinvestments.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
tax
hypothetical
is
not
quite
accurate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
bullock,
do
you
know
those
four
words?
