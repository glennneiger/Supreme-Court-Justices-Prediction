justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
a
city's
taking
of
private
property
for
the
purpose
of
economic
development
satisfies
the
public
use
requirement
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
1990,
a
state
agency
designated
the
city
of
new
london
as
a
distressed
municipality.
the
city
had
experienced
decades
of
economic
decline
and
its
unemployment
rate
was
nearly
twice
that
of
the
rest
of
the
state.
the
depressed
conditions
prompted
state
and
local
officials
to
target
new
london
for
economic
revitalization.
acting
through
its
nonprofit
development
agent,
the
city
formulated
an
integrated
development
plan
that
focused
on
90
acres
of
the
city's
fort
trumbull
area.
under
the
plan,
those
90
acres
would
be
redeveloped
for
a
number
of
commercial,
residential,
and
recreational
uses
including
a
waterfront
conference
hotel,
new
housing
units,
office
space
for
research
and
development
firms,
improved
marinas
and
waterfront
areas,
a
new
state
park
and
space
for
a
museum.
the
city
expected
that
that
plan
would
create
new
jobs,
increased
tax
and
other
revenues
and
improve
the
area's
recreational
opportunities.
after
the
formal
adoption
of
the
plan
in
2000,
the
city's
development
agent
purchased
most
of
the
real
estate
in
the
90
acre
area
from
willing
sellers.
however,
the
petitioners,
some
of
whom
have
lived
in
their
houses
for
their
entire
lives,
refused
to
sell
so
the
city
commenced
condemnation
proceedings
to
acquire
their
properties
in
exchange
for
the
payment
of
just
compensation.
the
petitioners
brought
suit
in
state
court
to
enjoin
the
condemnations
alleging
that
the
taking
of
their
properties
violated
the
public
use
requirement
of
the
fifth
amendment.
they
argued
that
an
economic
redevelopment
project
does
not
qualify
as
a
public
use
because
most
of
the
condemned
property
will
be
owned
by
private
parties.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
ruled
for
the
city
and
we
granted
certiorari.
for
over
a
century,
our
cases
have
embraced
a
broad
interpretation
of
public
use
as
public
purpose
and
without
exception,
our
cases
have
shown
deference
to
state
legislatures
in
determining
what
public
needs
justified
the
use
of
the
takings
power.
for
example,
in
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
centuries,
this
court
approved
the
taking
of
lands
needed
to
facilitate
agriculture
and
mining
in
the
western
states.
one
of
those
cases
is
authored
by
justice
holmes.
petitioners
and
their
numerous
amici
argued
that
those
cases
are
either
distinguishable
or
should
be
overruled,
but
their
arguments
for
a
reversal
rely
primarily
on
policy
considerations
rather
than
precedent.
rather
than
initiating
a
major
change
in
our
takings
jurisprudence,
we
adhered
to
settle
doctrine
and
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
state
supreme
court.
new
london's
effort
to
rejuvenate
its
economy
through
an
integrated
development
plan
qualifies
as
a
public
purpose.
economic
development
is
a
traditional
and
long
accepted
function
of
government
and
we
give
deference
to
the
city's
considered
judgment
and
that
its
plan
was
needed
to
breathe
life
into
its
ailing
economy.
it
is
not
within
our
authority
as
a
court
to
determine
the
plans
likelihood
of
success,
nor
to
determine
whether
new
london
would
have
been
wiser
to
pursue
economic
development
in
some
other
way.
our
authority
extends
only
to
determining
whether
the
city's
proposed
takings
are
for
a
public
use
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
an
unbroken
line
of
our
case
law
dictates
an
affirmative
answer
to
that
question.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
have
joined;
justice
thomas
has
also
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
