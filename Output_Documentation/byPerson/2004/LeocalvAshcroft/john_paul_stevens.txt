justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
about
substantial
risk?
say
it's...
there's
always
a
substantial
risk
when
you
get
in
the
car
and
you're
intoxicated.
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
you
actually
cause
an
injury
or
not?
there
are
two
drivers,
equally...
equally
drunk
and
equally
negligent.
one
hits
somebody
and
the
other
doesn't.
are
they
treated
alike
or
are
they
treated
differently
under
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
there's...
if
there's
clearly
the
substantial
risk
but
he
was
lucky
enough
not
to
hit
anybody,
then
he's
not
covered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
he
would
not
be
covered--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he
would
not
be
deportable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
or
not
you
hit
anybody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just...
just
following
up
on
justice
scalia's
question,
the
point
would
be
that
shooting
a
gun
is
the
threatened
use
of...
of
physical
force
against
a
person
or
property.
getting
into
a
car
is
not
the
threatened
use
of
physical
force
against
anything.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
your
submission,
as
i
understand
it,
the
attempted
use
or
threatened
use
is
really
a
worse
offense
than
the
use
because
it
involves
intent,
whereas
use
doesn't
necessarily
involve
actual
intent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
we're
really
looking
at
here,
when
you
get
all
done
with
all
this,
is
is
this
a
person
who
should
be
sent
back
to
haiti
because
of
this
particular
act
that
occurred.
and
the
irony
of
it,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
in
terms
of
moral
culpability
and...
and
the
kind
of
person
we
don't
want
to
stay
in
this
country,
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
whether
he
hit
somebody
when
he
was
drunk
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
maybe
i'm
repeating
a
little
bit
of
what
justice
breyer
asked.
but
in
the
blue...
statutory
appendix
to
the
blue
brief,
they
quote
from
section
101,
and
they
point
out
that
the
term
aggravate...
of
the
ina...
the
term
aggravated
felony
means
either
a...
for
purposes
of
1182,
either
any
felony...
any
crime
of
violence
or,
3,
a
crime
of
reckless
driving
described
as
intoxicated.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
statute
draws
a
rather
sharp
distinction
between
crime
of
violence
as
defined
in
section
16
of
title
18,
on
the
one
hand,
and
reckless
driving
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case,
on
the
other,
which
suggests
to
me
that
maybe
congress
thought
the
two
were
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
different.
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
an
opinion
to
announce
that
was
authored
by
the
chief
justice.
the
case
is
leocal
against
ashcroft
and
it
comes
to
us
from
the
eleventh
circuit.
section
237(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
allows
the
attorney
general
to
remove
any
alien
who
is
convicted
of
one
of
specified
set
of
crimes
including
any
offense
that
qualifies
as
a
"crime
of
violence"
under
section
16
of
title
18.
petitioner
is
a
lawful
permanent
resident
who
was
convicted
under
florida
statute
of
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
and
causing
serious
bodily
injury.
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
classified
the
conviction
as
a
crime
of
violence
under
section
16
and
charged
him
with
being
deportable
from
the
united
states.
an
immigration
judge
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
ordered
petitioner's
deportation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
also
holding
that
petitioner
dui
offense
is
a
crime
of
violence
dismissed
a
petition
for
review.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
courts
of
appeals
on
the
question
and
we
now
reverse.
in
determining
whether
a
particular
offense
is
a
crime
of
violence
under
section
16
we
looked
to
the
elements
and
nature
of
the
offense
of
conviction.
under
the
florida
dui
statute
petitioner
committed
a
third
degree
felony
by
operating
a
vehicle
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
and
causing
serious
bodily
injury
to
another.
like
the
dui
statutes
in
many
other
states
the
florida
statute
does
not
require
that
a
person
have
any
particular
mental
state
when
violating
the
statute
in
order
to
be
convicted.
section
16
has
two
parts,
neither
of
which
makes
petitioners
dui
conviction
a
crime
of
violence.
first,
section
16a
covers
any
offense
that
has
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force
against
the
person
or
property
of
another.
construing
this
provision
in
its
context
and
giving
the
language
its
most
natural
meaning
the
requirement
that
a
person
use
physical
force
against
another
person
or
property
suggest
a
higher
degree
of
intent
than
negligent
or
merely
accidental
conduct
such
as
that
involved
in
a
dui
offense.
in
theory,
one
may
use
something
in
an
accidental
manner,
however
it
is
much
less
natural
to
say
that
a
person
actively
employs
physical
force
against
another
person
by
accident.
the
second
part
of
section
16
also
does
not
cover
petitioner's
dui
offense.
section
16(b)
covers
"any
other
offense
that
is
a
felony
and
that
by
its
nature
involves
a
substantial
risk
that
physical
force
against
the
person
or
property
of
another
maybe
used
in
the
course
of
committing
the
offense."
while
this
provision
is
in
one
sense
broader
than
the
first
part
of
section
16,
since
it
covers
offenses
where
physical
force
was
not
actually
applied,
it
contains
the
same
language
we
found
dispositive
before
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
risk
that
physical
force
maybe
used
against
the
person
or
property
of
another.
this
language
connotes
a
higher
mens
rea
than
the
accidental
or
negligent
conduct
involved
in
the
dui
offense.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
the
chief
justice'
opinion
for
the
court
is
unanimous.
