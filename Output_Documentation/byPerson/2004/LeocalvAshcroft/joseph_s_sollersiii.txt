mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
drunk
driving
offenses,
while
most
serious
and
regrettable,
were
never
intended
to
be
crimes
of
violence
under
18
u.s.c.,
section
16,
triggering
removal
as
an
aggravated
felony.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
so
conclude
and
eliminate
the
disparity
and
patchwork
of
decisions
that
are
in
the...
that
are
currently
in
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
depending
upon
the
vagaries
of
where
a
removal
proceeding
is
instituted.
the
court
need
not
go
any
further
than
straight
statutory
construction
and
the
language
of
the
statutes
involved.
indeed,
the
florida
dui
statute
has
only
two
essential
elements:
driving
while
intoxicated
and
causing
serious
injury.
18
u.s.c.,
section
16--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--justice
o'connor,
there
certainly
is
an
increased
risk
of
an
accident.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
your
honor,
i
would
agree
that
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
an
accident
if
one
is
driving
drunk.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
your
honor,
subsection
(b)
also
has
the
use
of
force
as
an
element,
and
it
is
the
use
of
force
that
is
the
critical
terminology
here.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
would...
i
would
indicate
that
it's
the
categorical
approach
that
this
court
has
indicated
should
be
used
in
the
taylor
case,
as
well
as
the
courts
of
appeals
have
applied
the
categorical
approach...
indeed,
the
doe
case
in
the
first
circuit
did
so...
to
look
at
whether
or
not
that
element
is
present
in
the
underlying
predicate
of
facts.
and
the
element
is
the
use
of
force.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
yes.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
yes,
justice
scalia.
critical
is
that
the
actor
intended
to
use
force.
that
is
the
statutory
construction
here
and
it
is
clear,
as
you
look
at
the
statutory
scheme,
that
individuals
who
engaged
in
an
accident
were
not
intended
to
be
removed
as
aggravated
felons.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
your
honor,
i
think
under
the
categorical
approach,
you
look
to
the
essential
elements
of
the
underlying
offense.
and
i
go
back
to
the
dui
statute
in
florida
which
does
not
have
the
element
of
the
use
of
force.
indeed,
that
statute
is
a
strict
liability
statute.
it
requires
no
mens
rea
whatsoever,
does
not
even
require
negligence
for
a
conviction.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
your
honor,
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
a
number...
almost
every
state
has
a
similar
statute
to
the
one
in
florida.
where
there
is
a...
simply
a
causation
of
injury,
there's
an
enhanced
penalty
for
a
drunk
driving
offense.
of
course...
so
i
would
suggest
that
if
this
court
were
to
find,
as
we
believe
it
should,
that
the
use
of
force
is
required
for
it
to
be
an
aggravated
felony,
it
would
apply
across
all
50
states.
if
one
were
to
intentionally
use
force,
there
obviously
are
other
statutes
that
would
capture
it.
intentional
endangerment,
for
instance.
if
one
were--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--absolutely,
your
honor.
it's
absolutely
the
case
that
somebody
could
intend
to
use
force
who
is
drunk,
but
again,
there
are
other
statutes,
more
serious
statutes,
intentional
endangerment,
vehicular
assault,
statutes
such
as
that,
that
would
pick
up
such
an
action.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
burglary
is
an
offense
that
has
typically
been
looked
at
as
a
b
offense.
even
though
i
will
say
that
burglary
has
now
been
added
as
a
specific
offense
under
the
aggravated
felony
listing
in
the
ina,
burglary
is
the
offense
that...
that
is
typically
viewed
as
one
that
causes
someone
to
be
in
a
position
where
they
will
engage
in
a
volitional
act
of
force.
in
other
words,
you
break
into
a
house,
that's
a
volitional
act
in
and
of
itself,
but
then
you
are...
you
have
not
used
force
against
a
person,
but
you
have
put
yourself
in
a
position
where
you
are
likely
to
intentionally
use
force
against
someone
you
come
upon.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
that's
absolutely--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--absolutely,
and
so
is--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--i
would
suggest,
justice
kennedy,
that
it's
different
because
it
is
not
a
intentional
use
of
force.
it
is
an
accidental
action.
it
is
a
diminished
mens
rea.
and
again,
you
look,
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
crime
of
violence
has
occurred,
at
the
underlying
elements
of
the
statute,
and
this
florida
statute
simply
has
no
mens
rea
requirement
whatsoever.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
our
argument
is
that
there
has
to
be
simply
the
intentional
use
of
force
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
crime
of
violence.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
well,
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
it's
intentionally
driving
the
car,
but
i
would
not
agree
that
it
is
the
intentional
use
of
force
against
a
person
or
property
of
another.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
your
honor,
there's
a
continuum,
and
that
may
suggest
recklessness,
but
again,
this
statute
that
we're
looking
at,
the
florida
statute,
does
not
require
recklessness.
it
does
not
require
even
negligence.
it's
a
strict--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
your
honor,
i'm
not
necessarily
taking
a
position
as
to
whether
or
not
that's...
the
ninth
circuit
is
accurate
on
that.
what
i
am
taking
a
position
on
is
the
very
statute
at
issue,
which
is
the
florida
dui
statute,
which
has
no
negligence
requirement,
no
negligent...
or
no
recklessness
requirement.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
the
analysis
that
we
believe
is
the
correct
analysis
here
is
to
look
at
the
underlying
statute
to
see
whether
it
has
use
of
force,
and
this
statute
has
no
such
element.
it...
and
it
has...
again,
it
has
no
mens
rea
requirement.
now,
interestingly,
the
ninth
circuit
decision
looked
at
the
very
same
florida
statute
because
the
removal
proceeding
had
been
initiated
out
in
california...
so
that's
why
the
ninth
circuit
looked
at
the
florida
statute...
and
found
that
it
was
not
a
crime
of
violence
because
it
did
not
have
the
element
of
the
use
of
force.
it
did,
as
you
say,
indicate
that
a
recklessness
standard
would
satisfy
a
crime
of
violence
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
a
drive-by
shooting
into
an
occupied
building--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--i--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--yes,
your
honor,
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
it's
intentional
use
of
force.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
your
honor,
that
is
intentional
conduct
that
has
a
substantial
likelihood
of...
of
causing
injury.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
your
honor,
you
are
absolutely
correct.
it
is
the
use...
the
intentional
use
of
force
which
causes
injury,
that
is--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--i...
i
may
have,
and
if
i
did,
i...
i
apologize.
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
honor,
but--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--your
honor,
our...
justice
o'connor--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--that
is
an
intentional
act.
the
pulling
of
the
trigger
was
an
intentional
act
that
has--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
that
is...
i...
i
must
distinguish
the
two
however.
i
would
suggest
that
while
absolutely
a...
a
regrettable
and
serious
act
to
get
behind
the
wheel
when
one
is
drunk...
and
we
do
not
condone
that
whatsoever...
the
act
of
use
of
force
that
is
involved
is
at
most
negligence.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
i
accept
that,
your
honor,
justice
breyer.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
your
honor,
this
case
is
based
on
a...
an
underlying
statute
that
has
no
mens
rea
requirement
whatsoever,
and
a
crime
of
violence
requires
an
intentional
use
of
force.
the
legislative
history
i
believe
dictates
such
a
conclusion.
if
you
look
at
18
u.s.c.,
section
16,
its
origins
were
all...
was...
was...
the
origin
was
the
d.c.
court
reform
act,
which
was
a
detention...
a
detention
statute.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
your
honor,
there
is
a
continuum...
there's
no
question
about
it...
of
mens
rea,
beginning...
you
know,
you
have
the
strict
liability
offense
all
the
way
to
specific
intent.
i
don't
know
where
it
falls
to
get
into
a
car
when
you're
drunk,
but
i
will
suggest
that
the
analysis
for
this
court
in
determining
whether
or
not
it's
a
crime
of
violence
is
to
look
at
the
underlying
statute.
and
the
underlying
statute
does
not
require
even
mere
negligence
for
a
conviction.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
no,
your
honor.
no,
justice--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--well,
under
this
particular
statute,
it
requires
the
causation
of
the
injury,
but
it's
simply
a
causation
statute.
it's
the
consequence.
and
that's
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
so
it
does
make
a
difference
for
this
particular
statute,
otherwise
i
assume
you'd
be
convicted
of
simply
dui.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
he'd
be
covered
by
a
dui--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--if
he
was
caught.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
excuse
me.
i
misanswered
your
question.
he
would,
under
the
determination
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
be
deportable
because
they
have
found
that
there
is...
it
is
a
crime
of
violence--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--you
don't
necessarily
have
to
hit
somebody.
a
lot
of
these
cases
actually
look
at
straight
dui
offenses.
a
lot
of
these
immigration
cases
are
involving
straight
dui--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--i
believe
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
i
believe
that's
right
in
florida,
justice
o'connor.
that's
correct.
but
a
moment
ago,
justice
kennedy
asked
me
a
question
about
substantial
risk.
and
yes,
justice
kennedy,
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
an
accident
from
getting
behind
the
wheel
when
you're
drunk.
but
we
suggest...
and...
and
we
believe
that
the...
the
statutory
construction
supports
us...
that
there
is
not
a
substantial
of
the
intentional
use
of
force.
and
that's...
that's
the
difference.
it's
the
consequence.
in
the
cases...
a
number
of
cases
have,
improperly
so,
focused
on
the
consequence,
the
actual
injury
and
not
the
actual
use
of
force,
which
is
the
key
element
under
a
crime
of
violence,
18
u.s.c.,
section
16,
which
is
what
we're
construing.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
we...
first
of
all,
i
would
say
that
we
do
not
need
to
rely
on
the
rule
of
lenity
because
the
straight
language
of
the
statute
supports
our
position.
there
is
no
element
in
the
florida
statute,
use
of
force.
however,
if
it's
a
close
call,
we
would
be
able
to
rely
on
the
rule
of
lenity.
this
is
a
most
severe,
severe
punishment
that
is--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--that
is
not,
but,
of
course,
18
u.s.c.,
section
16
is
the
criminal
statute,
and
that
is
what
we're
here
to
decide,
the
reach
of
18
u.s.c.
16.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
absolutely.
it's
used
in--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i...
you
know,
i
know
the
rule
of
lenity
is
to
be
applied
to
criminal
statutes.
i
am
not
sure
on
sentencing
statutes.
but
i
will
say
that...
you
know,
we
are
not
saying
that
someone
who
gets
behind
a
wheel
who's
drunk
should
not
be
punished.
my
client
spent
2
years
in
jail
and
was
immediately
taken
to
ina
facility
and...
and
kept
there
for
several
months
before
he
was
shipped
back
to
haiti,
where
he
remains
now.
so
it
is
not
as
if
he
has
not
paid
a...
a
severe
price
for
what
he
did.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
i
understand
your
question,
justice
scalia.
i...
you
know,
our
analysis
is
strictly
on
the
statute
itself,
18
u.s.c.,
section
16,
which
requires
as
an
element
the
use
of
force
or
a
substantial
risk
that
force...
that
the
use
of
force
may
occur.
and
in
our
view,
this...
getting
in
a
car
while...
any
driving
certainly
involves
risk.
there's
no
question
about
that,
and
it's
enhanced
if
one
is
intoxicated.
but
it
is
not...
not
the
case
that
congress
intended
that
drunk
driving
offenses
and
accidents
relating
from
a
drunk
driving
offense
should
trigger
the
draconian
remedy
of
removal.
and
that...
that's
what
our
position
is.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
it's
not
the
intentional
use
of
any
force.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
well,
certainly
there
is
an
enhanced
risk
from
getting
into
the
car
while
you're
drunk.
however,
again,
the
florida
statute
and
statutes
like
it
across
the
country
do
not
have
any
mens
rea
element
whatsoever
required
for
conviction.
therefore,
it's
not
subsumed
by
18
u.s.c.,
section
16,
which
requires
use
of
force
as
an
element.
if
one
looks
at
the
aggravated
felonies
that
have
been
added,
on
four
of
five
occasions
the
list
of
aggravated
felonies
have
been
added
to
the
ina.
never
has
an
non-intent
crime
been
added.
there
have
been
multiple
occasions
in
which
congress
has
had
the
opportunity
to
specifically
add
dui
offenses.
they
have
never
been
added.
if
one
looks
at
the
ina
and
the
addition
of
serious
offenses
for
which
an
alien
can
be
inadmissible,
that
addition
in
1990...
and
the
congress
specifically
listed
separately
dui
offenses,
dui-type
offenses,
and
crimes
of
violence,
showing
that
congress
did
not
believe
that
dui
offenses
were
subsumed
by
18
u.s.c.,
section
16.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
that
is--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--well,
there
is
no
legislative
history
that...
to
indicate
that
congress
so
thought.
certainly
that
is
a
hypothetical
possibility.
we
do
not
believe
that's
the
case.
if
you
look
later
on
in
1990,
crimes
of
violence
were
specifically
added
as
aggravated
felonies,
and
the...
the
congress
did
not
add
dui
offenses
along
with
the
crimes
of
violence.
it
simply
added
18
u.s.c.,
section
16.
if
i
may,
i'm
going
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
very
briefly.
on
justice
scalia's
drive-by
shooting
example,
that
would
be
absolutely
a
use
of
force
that
has
an
element,
the
attempted
use
or
threatened
use
against
a
person
or
property
of
another.
respondent's
position,
as...
as
i
listened
to
it,
would
require,
as
i
think
the
court
fleshed
out,
that
if
someone
is
speeding
or
someone
runs
a
stop
sign
and
gets
in
an
accident
and
there's...
and
someone
is...
is
killed,
that's
an
involuntary
homicide
or
negligent
homicide,
and
that
would
be
a
crime
of
violence
for
which
someone
would
be
removed.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
or
even
injured,
quite
possibly,
yes,
your
honor,
depending
on
how
it's
charged.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
in
any
way
contemplated
that
such
an
offense
would
lead
to
such
a
draconian
result.
there
was
considerable
discussion
about
the
difference
between
the
use
of
force
and
consequence.
and
indeed,
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
decisions
that
respondent
can
cite
have
confused
the
difference
between
the
consequence
of
an
act
and
the...
the
use
of
force.
the
le
decision
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
as
well
as
the
tapia-garcia
decision
in
the
tenth
circuit,
both
confused
use
of
force
with
causation
of
injury.
and
even
in
the
tenth
circuit,
the
tapia-garcia
case
has
now
been
disfavored
by
a
subsequent
panel
in
lucio-lucio
that
focused
on
use
of
force,
and
the
chief
judge
in
the
tenth
circuit
was,
in
fact,
on
both
panels.
so
in
closing,
i
would
simply
indicate
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
momentous
decision.
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of...
there
are
a
tremendous
number
of
ramifications
that
stem
from
the
findings
that
a
dui
type
offense
is
a
violent
felony
under
18
u.s.c.,
section
16,
and
we...
we
recommend
and--
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
--your
honor,
there
are...
the
statute
is...
18
u.s.c.,
section
16
is
subsumed
in
a
number
of
different
other
statutes.
mr.
joseph
s.
sollers,
iii
there...
rico
actually
subsumes
crime
of
violence.
the
ownership
of
body
armor,
believe
it
or
not,
subsumes
crime
of
violence.
you're
not
allowed
to
own
body
armor.
there
are
a
number
of...
a
whole
array
of
different
statutes.
accordingly,
the
government
is...
has
attempted
to
expand
the
reach
of
18
u.s.c.,
section
16
well
beyond
the
bounds
of
what
congress
contemplated.
by
parsing
the
word
use
and
blurring
the
meaning
of
intentional
conduct,
the
government
would
seek
to
have
lawful,
permanent
residents
such
as
our
client
removed
under
these
circumstances.
and
we
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
reject
the
ill-founded
position
of
the
government.
thank
you.
