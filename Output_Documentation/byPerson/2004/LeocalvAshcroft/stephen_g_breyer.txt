justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
what
you
were
saying,
which
i
understood,
is
that
if
somebody
intentionally
uses
force
and
hurts
somebody...
might
hurt
somebody,
that
falls
within
the
statute.
if
they
do
it
negligently,
they
don't.
if
they
do
it
recklessly,
recklessly
and
often
assimilated
to
intention
in
the
law,
gross...
you
know,
recklessness
and
sometimes
it
isn't.
so
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
we
didn't
have
to
decide
that
one.
many
states
require
negligence
only
for
drunk
driving
hurting
somebody.
some
may
require
recklessness.
so
we
may
have
to
decide
it
some
day.
now,
that...
that's
where...
that's
where
i
came
into
this
argument.
now,
if
you're
disowning
that,
i
want
to
know.
if
you're
accepting
it,
i
want
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
might
be
recklessness.
i
mean,
i
think
that's
a
hard
question,
but...
but
i
guess
you
could
say
recklessness
in
respect
to
shooting?
of
course,
it's
covered.
recklessness
in
respect
to
drunk
driving?
i'm
not
so
sure.
it
may
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
crime,
the
nature
of
the
underlying
conduct.
but
you
may
not
accept
that.
you
may
want
an
all
or
nothing
answer,
in
which
case
you
can
answer.
i'd
have
to
say
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why,
i
guess,
reckless
is
a
harder
matter.
but
you
started
with
context,
and
when
i
looked
at
the
context
of
this
statute,
the
context
to
me
seemed
to
be
that
this
is
not...
this
is
a
statute
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
immigration.
16
is
a
definition
that's
a
kind
of
receptacle
that
other
statutes
refer
to.
and
it
was
part
of
the
original
criminal
code
reform
in
the
'80's.
and
the
purpose
of
that
was
to
pull
together
words
that
are
similar
throughout
the
u.s.
code
and
give
them
a
common
definition.
and
the
history
of
this
refers
back
to
the
d.c.
code.
the
history
of
this
and
other
similar
language
in
the
code
makes
clear
that
what
they're
talking
about
are
things
like
murder,
manslaughter,
burglary,
robbery,
extortion,
blackmail.
they
give
examples
for
all
these
things
elsewhere
in
the
code
with
similar
language.
so
if
i
look
at
the
context,
the
context
to
me
says,
though
the
language
can
be
read
to
cover
it,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
drunk
driving.
now,
that's
when
you
talk
about
context.
i
have
that
in
my
mind
as
context.
now,
you
tell
me
why
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i...
i
put
aside
the
reckless
argument,
and
i'm
not
relying
on
the
d.c.
code.
that
was
but
one
example.
i'm
saying
this
same
language
appears
elsewhere
in
the
u.s.
code,
924(e).
wherever
it
does
appear,
they
list
things
like
burglary,
arson,
extortion,
explosives,
and
otherwise.
and
there's
no
indication
that
this
is
meant
to
be
something
different
and
there's
every
indication
from
the
purpose
of
it
being
written
in
the
criminal
code
reform
that
congress
is
seeking
a
common
definition.
that's
what's
moving
me.
so
your
response
to
that
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it
could
have.
i'm
saying
it
didn't
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
your
evidence
that
it
did
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
in
the...
in
the
house...
in
the
senate
report
on
this
bill,
the
example
that
they
use
for
the
first
is
an
assault
or
a
battery.
nobody
has
used,
you
know,
blindly
in
your
sleep
knocking
over
a
table
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it's
pretty
hard
to
assimilate
your
model
to
like
an
assault.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
every
driving
accident
is
a
crime
of
violence--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
there's
negligence
involved.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
any...
any
one
that
is
criminal...
let's
see.
criminal
negligence
in
respect
to
driving
becomes
a
crime
of
violence
under
your
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
isn't
it
if
there's
a
traffic
infraction
involved?
a
traffic
infraction...
you
went
through
a
stop
sign.
in
justice
scalia's
example,
he
went
through
a
stop
sign.
