i
guess
what
bothers
me
about
this
is
that
clause
(b)
of
18
u.s.
code,
section
16
is...
it
says
the
crime
of
violence
means
any
other
offense
that's
a
felony
and,
by
its
nature,
involves
a
substantial
risk
that
physical
force
against
the
person
or
property
of
another
may
be
used
in
the
course
of
committing
the
offense.
if
someone
drives
while
drunk,
have
they
not
created
a
substantial
risk
of
the
automobile
or
the
vehicle
causing
personal
or
property
damage
to
another?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
substantial
risk
if
a
person
is
drunk.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
how
is
it
that
we
should
construe
this
provision
in
subsection
(b)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
is
recklessness
enough
or
not?
i...
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the...
the
shooting,
random
shooting,
in
a
building
for
target
practice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
is
getting
behind
a
wheel
when
you're
drunk
and
turning
on
the
keys.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
what's
your
answer
on
recklessness?
that's
fine.
maybe
we
don't
have
to
today,
but
we
have
to
look
ahead.
what
are
we
going
to
say
about
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
excuse
me.
i
thought
we
were
looking
at
aggravated
felony,
and
does
not
florida
make
it
a
felony,
a
serious
felony,
if
you
cause
serious
bodily
injury?
that's
what
puts
it
into
the
category
of
a
third
degree
felony.
if
you're
just
driving
under
the
influence,
it
doesn't
appear
to
fall
in
that
category.
maybe
i'm
not
reading
it
right--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
that's
how
i
read
the
florida
statute.
