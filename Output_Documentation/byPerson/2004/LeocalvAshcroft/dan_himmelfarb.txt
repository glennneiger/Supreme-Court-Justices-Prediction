mr.
dan
himmelfarb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
drunk
driving
that
kills
or
seriously
injures
another
person
is
a
serious
offense.
it
is
a
violent
offense
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
that
term,
and
it
satisfies
the
statutory
definition
of
crime
of
violence.
the
felony
offense
of
which
petitioner
was
convicted
by
its
nature
involves
a
substantial
risk
that
physical
force
may
be
used
against
the
person
or
property
of
another.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
statutory
terms
take
their
meaning
from
context,
and
in
the
context
of
section
16,
we
think
the
better
reading
of
use
is
that
it
doesn't
require
any
particular
mens
rea.
the
thing
that's
being
defined
in
section
16
is
a
crime
of
violence
and
violence
does
not
have
any
particular
mens
rea
associated--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--there
are
a
few
things
to
be
said
about
the
simple
offense
of
drunk
driving,
not
the
aggravated
offense.
the
first
is
that--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
justice
kennedy,
we
have
taken
that
position
in
the
lower
courts
and
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
agree
with
that
position
in
order
for
us
to
prevail
here.
as
an
initial
matter,
the
simple
offense
of
drunk
driving
is
ordinarily
a
misdemeanor,
and
since
it
doesn't
have
force
as
an
element,
it
could
only
be
a
crime
of
violence
if
it
fell
under
16(b)
which
covers
only
felonies.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
not
the
distinction
we're
drawing.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
we
think
the...
when
i
say
that
the
court
need
not
agree
with
us
that
simple
drunk
driving
is
a
crime
of
violence
in
order
to
hold
that
drunk
driving
resulting
in
serious
injury
is,
i
say
that
because
if
you
take
the
view
that
physical
force
requires
an
actual
crash,
which
is
petitioner's
view,
which
is
the
narrow
understanding
of
the
term
physical
force,
it
may
or
may
not
be
the
case...
it
is
a
debatable
proposition...
that
if
you're
simply
driving
drunk,
there's
a
substantial
risk
you're
going
to
crash
into
somebody.
somebody
might
make
the
argument
that
while
there's
a
risk,
it's
not
a
substantial
risk.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
justice
scalia,
we
read
threatened
use
and
attempted
use
to
require
intentional
conduct.
so
we
don't--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--no.
you
need
intent
under
(a)
for
a
threat
or
an
attempt
because
a
threat
or
an
attempt
by
its
nature
is
an
intentional
act.
but
the
use
of
physical
force
in
either
(a)
or
(b)
is
not
by
its
nature
an
intentional--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
right.
that
was
my
position.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
have
taken
that
position
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
believe...
our
position
in
the
lower
courts
is
that
it's
a
crime
of
violence
under
16(b),
but
there
are
arguments...
the
argument
the
other
way--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
right.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
if
it's
a
misdemeanor,
it
couldn't
be
a
crime
of
violence
under
(a)
because
force
isn't
an
element
and
under
(b)
because
it's
not
a
felony.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
there
are--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--no.
my
position
is
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
drunk
driving
without
the
aggravated
injury
element
is
a
crime
of
violence.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
yes,
there
is.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
right.
there
are
simple--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that
is
our
position.
it's
also
our
position
that
the
court
need
not
accept
it
in
order
for
us
to
prevail
in
this
case.
there
is
a
difference
between
the
sort
of
driving
that
takes
place
when
somebody
simply
drives
drunk
and
doesn't
cause
an
injury
and
the
sort
of
driving
that
takes
place
when
somebody
not
only
drives
drunk
but
injures
another
person.
if
somebody
is
driving
and
swerving
or
driving
and
falling
asleep
at
the
wheel
or
driving
and
doing
any
of
the
things--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--we
think
it
would
be,
justice
ginsburg.
and
to
respond
to
your
first
question,
the
distinction
between
those
two
situations
is
that
you
have
to
look
not
at
the
underlying
conduct
to
decide
whether
something
is
a
crime
of
violence,
but
you
have
to
look
at
the
offense
with
which
the
defendant
was
charged
and
of
which
he
was
convicted
and
see
what
the
elements
are
and
what
the
risk
is
by
its
nature.
so
if
somebody
is
charged
and
convicted
simply
of
simple
driving
under
the
influence,
that
crime
by
its
nature
may
or
may
not
involve
a
substantial
risk
of
force
even
though
in
a
particular
case
someone
might
be
swerving.
but
if
there's
injury,
the
crime
by
its
nature
has
to
entail
the
sort
of
driving
beyond
the
ordinary
drunk
driving
offense--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--no,
we
don't
think
you
do,
justice
kennedy.
my
point
is
that--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
here...
here's
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
our--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--our
primary
submission
is
that
the
crime
at
issue
here
falls
under
16(a)
because
the
use
of
force
is
an
element
because
if
you're
driving
drunk,
you
can't
injure
somebody
without
using
force.
but
our
fallback
position
is
that
even
if,
as
petitioner
contends,
the
only
time
you
use
force
in
the
drunk
driving
context
is
when
you
actually
crash
your
car
into
somebody,
and
he
hypothesizes
these
types
of
injuries
which
in
his
view
don't
involve
physical
force.
there
is,
at
a
minimum,
going
to
be
a
substantial
risk
that
you
will
crash
your
car
into
somebody
if
you're
not
only
driving
drunk,
but
driving
drunk
in
a
way
that
results
in
injury
no
matter
how
the
injury
is
caused.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no.
we
don't
rely
on
the
threat...
the
threat
language
in
16(a),
justice
scalia.
we
rely
on
use.
if
you
drive
drunk
and
you
injure
somebody,
you're
using
physical
force
against
that
person.
but
even--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
the
measure
of
the
seriousness
of
a
crime--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that's
an
important
point.
we
don't
think
that
mens
rea
is
the
measure
of
the
seriousness
of
a
crime.
there
are
a
number
of
crimes
that
are
indisputably
crimes
of
violence
under
petitioner's
view
that
are
mens
rea
crimes
that,
in
the
scheme
of
things,
people
would
think
are
not
as
serious
as
drunk
driving
resulting
in
serious--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
for
example,
simple
misdemeanor
assault
would
be
a
crime
of
violence
under
16(a).
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
that's
right,
justice
scalia,
but
for
example,
reckless
homicide,
a
depraved
heart
murder,
which
in
most
states
is
second
degree
murder,
under
petitioner's
view
of
things--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
a...
that's
a...
that's
the...
the...
i
think
the
common
law
term
for
reckless
homicide.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
think
that's...
that's
the
same
thing,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
in
any
event,
that
doesn't
require
intentional
conduct.
that
requires
only
recklessness.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons
why
you're
wrong.
the
first
is
that
insofar
as
section
16
was
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
the
d.c.
code
provision,
the
d.c.
code
provision
listed
specific
crimes.
congress
did
not
do
that.
it
had
two
general
definitions.
so
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
think
that
congress
would
be
aware
that
it
would
be
foreseeable
to
congress
that
the
general
definitions,
the
general
language
it
was
using
might
pull
in
some
crimes
that
were
not
among
those
listed
in
the
d.c.
code
provision.
the
second
point
is
that
the
very
first
crime
listed
in
that
d.c.
code
provision
is
murder,
and
as
i've
just
said,
second
degree
murder
includes
in
many
jurisdictions
reckless
homicide.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
insofar
as
the
issue
is
whether
congress
could
have
had
this
type
of
crime
in
mind,
we
think
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
let
me...
let
me
rephrase
the
question
and
the
answer.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
insofar
as
the
issue
is
whether
congress
did
have
this
type
of
crime
of
mind,
we
think
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
because
a...
a...
the
classic
example
of
a
crime
of
violence,
as
you
have
just
pointed
out,
is
murder,
and
as
i've
said,
reckless
homicide
is
a
form
of
murder.
the
definition
of
use
that
petitioner
is
advancing
is
to
employ
something
for
a
purpose.
so
the
mens
rea
that
he
advocates
be...
be
read
into
the
statute
is
purposefulness,
and
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
recklessness,
which
is
a
lesser
form
of
mens
rea,
fits
at
all
comfortably
with
the
concept
of
purposefulness.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
we
don't...
we
don't
think
it
does,
justice
stevens,
and...
and
that's
even
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
congress
that
enacted
that--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--statute
was
a
different
congress
from
the
one
that
enacted
section
16.
but
the...
the
thrust
of
petitioner's
argument
under
1101(h)
is
that
if
you
interpret
a
crime
of
violence
to
include
drunk
driving
resulting
in
bodily
injury,
you
will
render
1101(h)(3)
essentially
superfluous.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
that--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
that's
the
point
i
was
just
about
to
make,
justice
scalia,
and
we
think
it
does
separate
the
two,
and
there
is
no
overlap.
there
is
some
overlap,
but
there's
not
complete
overlap.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
it...
it
applies
in
the
sense
that
if,
at
the
very
end
of
the
interpretive
process,
the
court
is
left
with
a
grievous
doubt
as
to
which
way
it
should
rule,
yes.
it
doesn't
apply
in
the
sense
that
we
don't
think
there
is
a
grievous
doubt
in
the
case.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
ginsburg,
there
is,
to
be
sure,
language
in
this
court's
decisions
suggesting
that.
we
have
never
agreed
with
that
view.
we
think
the
immigration
context
is
very
different
from
the
criminal
context.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
it...
it
doesn't,
justice
scalia.
our
only
point--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--our
only
point
is
that
if...
if
the
rule
of
lenity
is
to
be
applied
here,
we
think
that
the
basis
for
applying
it
is
that
we're
dealing
with
a
criminal
statute,
not
that
we're
dealing
with
a
criminal
statute
incorporated
into
the
immigration
laws.
i
do
want
to
say
a
little
bit
more
about
the...
the
text
and
statutory
context
definition
of
crime
of
violence.
apart
from
the
thing
that's
being
defined,
crime
of
violence...
and
as
i've
said,
we
don't
think
that
the
word
violence
has
any
mens
rea
necessarily
associated
with
it.
the
definition
of
the
thing
that's
being
defined
is
the
use
of
physical
force--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
crime,
more
often
than
not,
does
but
it
doesn't
always.
so
we
think
the
focus
should
be
on
whether
the
crime
involves
violence,
which
we
think
is
essentially
an
actus
reus
and
not
a
mens
rea.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
actus
reus
means
the
actual
criminal
conduct
as
opposed
to
the
defendant's
state
of
mind
when
he's
carrying
out
that
conduct.
and
since
legislatures
do
regulate...
do
impose
criminal
liability
for
violent
acts
and
they
have
varying
degrees
of
mens
rea
in
those
criminal
definitions,
we
don't
think
that
a
mens
rea
should
be
read
into
this
statute.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
don't
think
so.
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--courts...
courts
have
generally
read
use
of
physical
force
in
section
16
to
mean
something
more
than
force
in
a
literal
or
a
scientific
sense.
force
in
this
context
means
violent
or
force
that
has
the
risk
of
causing
injury.
now--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
of
course,
justice
scalia,
you
would
have
to
have
a
legislature
criminalizing
that
conduct,
and
i
think
it's
very
unlikely--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--justice
scalia,
if
two
outfielders
are
chasing
after
a
fly
ball
and
they
crash
into
each
other,
the
next
day
in
the
newspaper
you
may
well
read
a
headline
that
talks
about
a
violent
crash
in
the
outfield
during
that
game.
i
don't
think
it
does
any
violence,
if
you'll
forgive
the
expression--
[laughter]
--to
ordinary
english
usage
to
say
that
when
there
is
a
collision
between
cars,
when
there
is
a
collision
between
athletes
who
are
running
at
full
speed,
that
is
a
violent
act.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
i've
been...
i've
been
speaking
of
the
thing
that's
being
defined.
i
want
to
speak
some
more
about
the
definition
that's
really
the
ultimate
statutory
language
that's
being
interpreted,
which
is
use
of
physical
force.
in
the
context
of
section
16,
we
think
that
the
use
of
physical
force
means
the
application,
the
exertion,
the
putting
into
action
of
physical
force,
and
in
the
absence
of
some
specification
of
a
purpose,
for
example,
the
use
of
physical
force
to
subdue
an
attacker
or
to
gain
entry
to
a
building,
we
don't
think
that
the
exertion,
application,
or
putting
into
action
of
physical
force
has
any
particular
mens
rea
associated
with
it.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
that...
that
wouldn't
be
a
crime,
of
course,
justice
breyer.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
an
assault--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
the...
our
essential
point
is
that
legislatures
define
crimes
with
all
sorts
of
mens
rea,
ranging
from
specific
intent
on
one
end
of
the
spectrum
to
strict
liability
on
the
other.
and
sometimes
the
thing
that
is
being
prohibited
involves
violence
and
sometimes
it
doesn't.
dui
manslaughter,
dui
resulting
in
serious
injury
is
a
classic
example
of
a
case
where
the
thing
that
is
being
criminalized,
the
act,
is
violent
but
the
mens
rea
is
not
an
intent
mens
rea.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
think...
i
think
we
would
have
to
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
most
driving
accidents
aren't
criminal
at
all.
it...
it
takes--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
don't...
i
don't
know
that
legislatures
generally
criminalize
most
car
accidents.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
felony
or
even
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
think--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
think
a
traffic
infraction
probably
would
not
be
even
a
misdemeanor.
so
there's
a
whole
set
of
driving
infractions
that
wouldn't
even
rise
to
the
level
of
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
we
are,
justice
souter,
because
a
traffic
infraction
would
not
have
as
an
element
the
use
of
force.
if
you
drive
through
a
stop
sign
and
you're
cited
for
driving
through
a
stop
sign,
the
offense
you're
cited
for
would
not
have
an
element--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--no.
no,
justice
souter.
we...
we
agree
that
the
use
of
force
has
to
be
directed
against
another
person.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
right.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
do.
i
just
want
to
say
one
last
thing
about
the
other
part
of
this
case.
most
of
the
discussion
has
been
whether
use
requires
intent.
petitioner
actually
makes
two
alternative
arguments.
one
has
to
do
with
the
meaning
of
the
word
use.
the
other
has
to
do
with
the
meaning
of
physical
force.
we
don't
think
that
the
physical
force
part
of
this
case
is
truly
in
dispute.
his
view
is
that
physical
force
requires
that
the
driver
actually
crash
into
somebody,
but
we
think
that
if
you're--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
true,
justice
souter.
i
was--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
agree
he's
making
an
argument
about
the
requirement
of
intent
which
he
thinks
the
word
use
encompasses.
he's
also
making
an
alternative
argument,
which
is
whether
or
not
use
requires
intent,
the
crime
does
not
have
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force
because
you
could
injure
somebody
by
driving
drunk
without
the
use
of
physical
force.
and
he
gives
examples
of
how
you
could
do
that.
our
position
is
that
even
if
those
examples
he
gives,
for
example,
swerving
and
forcing
somebody
off
the
road
or
falling
asleep
at
the
wheel
and
having
somebody
else
crash
into
you,
even
if
those
examples
do
not,
by
themselves,
involve
the
use
of...
involve
physical
force,
it's
our
view
that
if
you're
driving
drunk
and
you're
doing
those
things,
there's
a
substantial
risk
of
physical
force.
so
on
the
physical
force
part
of
the
case,
we
think
we
win
under
16(b),
which
means
that
the
only
issue
that's
really
in
dispute
between
the
parties
is
whether
use
requires
intent.
and
for
all
the
reasons
in
our
brief
and
the
reasons
i've
given
today,
i
think
our
position
is
correct.
