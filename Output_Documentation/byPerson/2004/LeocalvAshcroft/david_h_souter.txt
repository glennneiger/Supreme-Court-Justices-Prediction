justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
your...
is...
is
your
argument
really
that
there's
got
to
be
an
intentional
use
of
force
or
an
intentional
use
of
force
in
order
to
injure?
justice
david
h.
souter
without
looking...
without
looking
to
the...
to
the
consequence,
to...
to
the...
to
the
result?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
there's
got
to
be
more
than
simply
a
risk
of
causing
injury.
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
there
has
got
to
be
a
risk
of
acting
intentionally
to
cause
injury,
as
in
the
case
of
the
burglar
who
suddenly
is
surprised.
now...
now,
which
is
it?
is
it...
if...
if
it's
merely
causing
injury,
then
you're
in
trouble
under
part
(b).
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it's
causing...
if
it's...
it's
using
force
for
the
purpose
of
causing
injury,
then
i
can
see
at
least
a
consistent
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe...
maybe
we
do
and...
and
this
depends
on...
on
something
i
just
don't
know.
maybe
you
do.
are
there
states
that
define
the
second
or
a
third
subsequent
dui
offense
as
felonious
rather
than
a
misdemeanor?
justice
david
h.
souter
then...
then
we
do
have
to
reach
that
issue
because
those
would
qualify
as
felonies,
and
on
your
analysis
of
(b),
which
doesn't
require
intent,
they...
they
would...
they
would
fall
under
(b).
justice
david
h.
souter
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
it.
so
that
if
we
accept
your
position
and
there
are
states
that...
that
do
classify
subsequent
offenses
as
felonies
regardless
of
injury,
there
would
be
some
dui
offenses
without
injury
that
would
be
crimes
of
violence
and...
and
a
basis
for
deportation.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
you'd
say
it
is
a
violent
result.
yes,
a
violent
crash.
you're
right.
they'd
say
that
in
the
paper.
but
they
wouldn't
say
that
the
two
players
were
committing
acts
of
violence.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
have
to
be--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
don't
know,
and
if
you're
going
to...
if
you're...
you're
making
an
argument
based
on
what
the
language
read
most
broadly
can
accommodate,
and
if
we're
going
to
follow
that
criterion,
then
the...
the
reference
to
the...
to
the
infraction
in
(a)
is
offense.
an
offense
is
certainly
broad
enough
to...
to
include
driving
infractions,
as
well
as
misdemeanors.
i
mean,
if...
if
you
want
a
broad
interpretation,
you're
going
to
pick
up
a
lot.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
offense
you're...
you're
cited
for
is
driving
your
car
through
the
stop
sign
and
you've
just
been
telling
us
that...
that
using
an
automobile
is
inherently
a
use
of
force.
sure,
it
would
cover
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
he
said
his
view
is
that
the...
that
the
physical
force
requires
an
element
of
intent,
which
you
dispute.
justice
david
h.
souter
he's
making
the...
he's
making
the
same
argument
that
justice
holmes
said
the
dog
understands,
the
difference
between
getting
tripped
over
and
kicked.
and...
and
you're
saying
no.
the
dog's
perception
doesn't
count
in...
in
the...
the
interpretation
of...
of
using
force.
