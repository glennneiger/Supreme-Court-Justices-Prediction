we'll

argument
now
in
no.
03-583,
josue

v.

d.
ashcroft.
mr.
sollers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
people
who
are
drunk
can
intend
to
use
force.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
this
were
a
straight
criminal
statute
and
the
arguments
on
each
side
were
very
close,
you
would
be
entitled
to
rely
on
the
rule
of
lenity.
this
is
just
a
reflection
really
of
a
criminal
statute.
it's
a
deportation
statute.
are
you
entitled
to
rely
on
the
rule
of
lenity
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
it's...
it's
never
been
regarded
as
criminal,
a
deportation
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sollers.
mr.
himmelfarb,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
used
against
the
person.
doesn't
that
connote
some
more
intent
than
there
is
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
the
mental
state
is
presumably
the
same
whether
it's
drunken
driving
without
injury
or
drunken
driving
with
injury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
you're
not,
but
why...
why
don't
you?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
depraved
heart
murder?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
a
murder
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
malignant
and
abandoned
heart
is
what
we
learned
in
law
school.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
word
violence
doesn't.
and
i
think
you're
probably
right.
there
are
all
sorts
of
violent
things
that
happen.
but
you're
dealing
with
the
phrase,
crime
of
violence.
and
more
often
than
not,
crime
does
have.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
actus
reus
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
offense
you're
cited
for
in
justice
scalia's
hypo
is
negligent
homicide,
not
going
through
a
stop
sign.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
himmelfarb.
mr.
sollers,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sollers.
the
case
is
submitted.
