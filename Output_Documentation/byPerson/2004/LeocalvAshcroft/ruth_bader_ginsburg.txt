are
you
suggesting
then
that
it
should
vary
from
state
to
state
whether
the
vehicle
homicide
is
a
crime
of
violence,
that
we
should
look
to
the
particular
state,
so
that
people
engaged
in
the
same
conduct
in
one
state
will
be
subject
to
removal
and
others
will
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
disagree--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
disagree
with
ninth
circuit
that
said
negligence
is
not
covered,
but
a
reckless
state
of
mind
would
be
covered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
just
responded
to
my
question
that
it's
the
same
in
all
50
states.
so
either
it's
peculiar
to
florida
or
it's...
if
i
take
your
last
answer
to
be
correct,
it
would
be
the
same
in
all
50
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
responded--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
you
responded
to
justice
breyer's
first
inquiry
reckless,
at
least
maybe,
and
if
that
was
your
answer,
if
i
understood
your...
that
you
agreed
with
him,
why
isn't
getting
into
a
car
when
you
are
drunk
inherently
reckless
because
you
know
there's
a
high
risk
of
hurting
someone?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government
suggests
that
congress
in
an
excess
of
caution
might
have
listed
dui
because...
because
the
decisions
in
the
lower
courts
were
divided
on
the
question
of
the
correct
categorization.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
it
would
do
nothing...
it
would
have
changed
nothing.
it
just
would
have
been
clarified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
might
be
lucky
and
nothing
happens.
i
mean,
that's
the...
the
problem
thing.
two
people
who
engage
in
identical
conduct,
one
has
the
misfortune
to
hit
someone,
the
other
doesn't,
but
they're
both
equally
swerving
in
and
out.
the...
the
distinction
is
whether
someone
is
hit.
and
in
that
light,
suppose
there
were
an
involuntary
manslaughter
conviction
for
someone
who
was
speeding
but
cold
sober,
speeding,
cold
sober,
and
killing
someone
because
he
couldn't
stop
the
car
fast
enough.
would
that
also
be
a
crime
of
violence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about...
isn't
there
also
a
principle
that
in
deportation
statutes,
ambiguities
are
to
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
alien?
