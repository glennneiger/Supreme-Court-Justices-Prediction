justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
before
you
quite
get
there...
and
of
course,
that's
where
you...
you
should
go
and
i
don't
mean
to
sidetrack
you.
but
the
phrase
before
that
is
by
its
nature,
so
that
we
don't
look
at
the
specific
details
of
the
offense.
we
look
to
the
offense
itself.
and
if
by
its
nature,
as
a
generic
matter,
as
a
categorical
matter,
there
is
a
substantial
risk,
then
quite
without
reference
to
the
particular
facts
of
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
applies.
so
you
have
to
address
the
by
its
nature
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
once
again,
do
you
have
to
have
intent
in
the
particular
case?
because
the
offense
must
by
its
nature...
you
mean
by
the
nature
of
the
particular
offense
that
this
person
committed
or
by
nature
of
the
felony
broadly
categorized?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
about
burglary?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
risk
of
the
driver
going
the
wrong
way
on
a
freeway?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's...
that's
a
substantial
risk,
or
it's
a
risk
at
least,
of...
of
drunk
driving.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
how
that's
different
from
burglary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
95
miles
an
hour?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
that's
because
there's
always
a
substantial
risk.
whether
there's
an
intent
to
be
negligent
or
a
likelihood
of
negligence
or
a
likelihood
of
risk,
that's
inherent
in
driving
a
car
while
you're
drunk.
you
want
this
court
to
say,
in
effect,
that
there
is
no
substantial
risk
in
drunk
driving.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
substantial
risk
of
use
of
force.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
why
when
the
statute
says
the
offense
by
its
nature
includes
the
risk?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
rule
of
lenity
apply
in
sentencing
statutes
as
opposed
to
the
definition
of
crimes?
i
don't...
i
don't
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
don't
we
interpret
it
as
getting
into
a
car
while
drunk
and,
as
justice
o'connor
points
out,
while
drunk
and
causing
an
injury?
otherwise,
the
statute
isn't
even
applicable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
have
to
tell
you.
in
a...
in
a
traffic
court
where
we
see
all
too
many
drunk
driving
cases
go
through
the
calendar,
no
injury
is
involved.
i
recognize
there
is
in
this
case.
in
the...
in
the
drunk
driving
case
without...
without
any
aggravating
factors,
i
just
don't
think
judges
think
of
those
as
crimes
of
violence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you...
do
you
tell
your
family
i
committed
a
crime
of
violence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
incidentally,
because
i
thought
your
opening
remarks
were
applicable
to
drunk
driving
as
an
offense
generically
and...
and
as
a
whole.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then...
then
the
word
substantial
risk
does
no
work
in...
in
that...
in
the...
in
the
case
that
justice
ginsburg
put.
we
just
ignore
substantial
risk.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
do
we
need
substantial
risk?
they
hit...
they
hit
somebody.
we
know
they
hit
somebody.
that's
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
question
is,
what
about
her
other
hypothetical
where
the
person
is
driving
90
miles
an
hour
and
hits
no
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
still
a
substantial
risk.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
it's
standard--
