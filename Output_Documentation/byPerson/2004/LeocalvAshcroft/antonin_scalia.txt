justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sollers,
i
thought
your...
your
response
to
the
problem
of
(b)
was
that
(b)
also
requires
not
just...
not
just
a
risk
that
there
be
physical
injury,
but
a
substantial
risk
that
physical
force
against
person
or
property
be
used.
so
it's
still
the
same
terminology,
using
physical
force.
and
the
question
we
have
before
us
is
whether
that
terminology
means
it
must
intentionally
be
applied
or
could
simply
be
applied
carelessly,
negligently,
as
by
someone
who
is
driving
dui.
isn't...
isn't
that
the...
the
answer
to
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
at
least
your...
your
proffered
answer
to
the
problem
of
(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
intentionally
driving
a
car--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
speeding
along
at
65
miles
an
hour.
that's
intentionally
using
force,
surely.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
we
have
to
look
down
the
road
to
the
next
case.
so,
you
know,
you
can't
just
not
answer
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
about
a
drive-by
shooting
into
an
occupied
building?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
you're
not
sure
you're
going
to
hit
anybody.
you're
not
even
sure
there's
anybody
in
the
building,
but
you
drive
by
and
you
just
shoot
a...
a
bullet
into
the
building.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
would
say
that
the...
is
that
covered
by
this
statute?
i'd
certainly
want
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
against
a
person.
it
has
to
be
the
intentional
use
of
force
against
a
person.
he
didn't...
he
didn't
intend
to
hit
a
person.
he
just
didn't
care
whether
there
was
anybody
there
or
not.
it's
the
classic
recklessness
case.
classic...
he
didn't...
wasn't
shooting
at
any
particular
person.
just
having
a
good
old
time
shooting
out
a
window
in
a...
in
a
building.
he
didn't
know
was
anybody
in
there
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
is...
so
is
driving
under
the
influence.
it
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you've
changed
your
answer
to
my
previous
question
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sollers--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it...
it
doesn't
impose
criminal
penalties
on
its
own.
is
it
used
in
other
criminal
statutes
that
do
impose
criminal
penalties?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
that's...
that's
your
answer,
that...
that
you
can't
interpret
section
16
one
way
for
purposes
of
deportation
statutes
and
another
way
for
purposes
of
criminal
statutes.
and
therefore,
the
rule
of
lenity
does
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sollers,
let...
let
me
ask
you
about
the
recklessness
problem
that...
that
a
number
of
us
have.
you...
you
insist
on...
on
defining
the
crime
of
violence
as
one
that
requires
the
intentional
application
of
force
against
an
individual.
why...
why
do
you
need
that
in
order
to
win
your
case?
why
couldn't
you
just
define
it
as
the
intentional...
the
intentional...
use
of
a
mode
of
force
that
is
likely
to
injure
an
individual?
now,
driving
on
a
highway
is
not...
is
not
likely
to
injure
an
individual.
shooting
a
gun
into...
into
a
building
is
likely
to...
to
injure
an
individual.
why
shouldn't
that
be
the...
the
distinction?
either
you
intend
to
use
it
against
a
person
or
you
have
intentionally
used
a
mode
of
force
that
is
in
its
nature
likely
to
injure
a
person,
not
caring
whether
it
does
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
it
certainly
would
come
within
(a).
it
certainly
would
come
within
(a).
an
offense...
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
felony
to
be
within
(a).
an
offense
that
has
an
element
the
threatened
use
of
physical
force
against
the
person
or
property
of
another.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
so
you
need
intent
for
(a)
but
you
don't
need
intent
for
(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then...
then
you...
then
you
think
(a)
does
not
apply
to
ordinary
dui.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
i
thought
your...
i
thought
your
position
was
that
ordinary
dui
is
a
crime
of
violence.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
believe
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
wait,
wait.
ordinary
dui
is
a
crime
of
violence
under
16(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
felony.
ordinary
dui
is
not
a
felony.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
is
your
current
position
and...
and
we
can
take
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
simply--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
your
primary
position
is
(a),
then...
then
i
think
you're
back
to
the...
to
the
situation
that
ordinary
dui
would
come
under
(a).
it
has
an
element
the
threatened
use
of
physical
force.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
are
they?
what
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course.
it's
a
crime
of
violence
because
you
intend
to
apply
force
to
the
body
of
another
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't
think
your...
your
that
was
a
different
congress
argument
carries
much
weight.
we
don't
usually
interpret
the
united
states
code
to
be
chaotic
because
each
of
the
sections
has
been
enacted
by
a
different
congress.
we
try
to
reconcile
the
whole
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
think
it...
it
is
telling
that
this
thing
does
seem
to
separate
reckless
driving
from...
from
a
crime
of
violence.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
that...
that
the
rule
of
lenity
applies?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
you
concede
the
rule
of
lenity,
which
says
the
same
thing?
ambiguities
are
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they're
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
if
i
bump
into
somebody
getting
off
the
bus,
i've...
i've
committed,
as
far
as
actus
reus
is
concerned,
an
act
of
violence.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
say,
excuse
me,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
committed...
committed
an
act
of
violence.
[laughter]
this
is
just
not
normal
use
of
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
bump
into
him
really
hard,
really
hard.
he
falls
down.
i've
committed
an
act...
an
act
of
violence?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
criminalizing.
i'm
just
talking
about
normal
english
usage.
would
you
say
that
i
committed
an
act
of
violence?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
how
hard
i...
i
accidentally
bumped
into
him.
you
wouldn't
say,
you
know,
scalia...
he's
a
violent
man.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
totally
different
meaning
of
violence.
you
can
talk
about
a
violent
wind.
[laughter]
it...
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
when
you're
talking
about
a
violent
act
in
the
sense
of...
of
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
negligent
homicide?
you...
you
absent
mindedly
don't
see
a
stop
sign.
you
go
through
the
stop
sign
and
someone
is
killed
or
just
injured.
someone
is
injured
through
your
negligence
driving
a
car.
is
that...
under
your
definition,
that's
a
crime
of
violence.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
think
you
would,
and
boy,
that's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
felony.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
has
to
be
an
offense--
justice
antonin
scalia
--certainly
an
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right,
but
you...
you
agree
negligent
homicide
would...
would
be
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
even
injured
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
consequences
besides
deportation?
justice
antonin
scalia
such
as.
