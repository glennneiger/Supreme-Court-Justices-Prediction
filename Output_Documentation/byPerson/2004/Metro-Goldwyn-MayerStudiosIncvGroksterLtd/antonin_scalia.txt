how
do
you...
how
do
you
know,
going
in,
mr.
verrilli?
i
mean,
i'm
about
to
start
the
business.
how
much
time
do
you
give
me
to
bring
up
the
lawful
use
to
the
level
where
it
will
outweigh
the
unlawful
use?
i
have
to
know,
going
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
one
thing
to
sit
back
and,
you
know,
calculate
with
this
ongoing
business,
it's
90
percent/10
percent.
but
i'm
a
new
inventor,
and
i'm...
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
going
to
get
sued
right
away.
i
know
i'm
going
to
get
sued
right
away,
before
i
have
a
chance
to
build
up
a
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
inventor
of
xerox
does
that.
i
mean,
he
puts
out
the
machine.
he
knows
some...
he
knows
a
lot
of
people
are
going
to
use
it
to
xerox
books.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
second
argument,
i
think.
i
thought
you
were
going
to
just
stick
with
the...
with
the
first
one.
i
mean,
that's
an
inducement
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
inducement...
the
inducement
point
doesn't
get
you
very
far.
presumably
a
successor
to
grokster,
or
whatever
this
outfit
is
called,
could
simply
come
in
and
not
induce
anybody
but
say,
you
know,
"we're
setting
up
the
same
system.
"
know
very
well
what
people
are
going
to
use
it
for,
but
not
induce
them.
and
that
would
presumably
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
why
you
need--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
sony--
justice
antonin
scalia
--will
you
give
a
company
ten
years
to
establish
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what
i
worry
about
is
the
suit
that
just
comes
right
out
of
the
box,
as
soon
as
the
company
starts
up.
will
you
give
the
company
a
couple
of
years
to
show
that
it's
developing
a
commercial
use?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
are
inherent.
they
are
inherent.
i
mean,
the
point
is
that
those
past
acts
are
what
have
developed
your
client's
current
clientele.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
verrilli,
i
hope
you
won't
waste
a
lot
of
your
time
on
this
point.
this
court
is
certainly
not
going
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
stare
decisis,
you
know,
whatever
else
is
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
i
think
it
would
also
include
disabling
yourself
from
looking
at
it.
and
so,
i
think
it's
an
important
part
of
your
case,
that
you
didn't
adopt
this
new
system
of
decentralizing
the
file
so
that
it's
in
the
computers,
out
there,
solely
in
order
to
get
around
napster.
justice
antonin
scalia
because,
i
gather,
that
some
artists
don't
make
money
from
the
records,
but
make
money
from
the
popularity
that
draws
fans
to
their
concerts.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they're
willing
to
give
away
the
records
for
free.
