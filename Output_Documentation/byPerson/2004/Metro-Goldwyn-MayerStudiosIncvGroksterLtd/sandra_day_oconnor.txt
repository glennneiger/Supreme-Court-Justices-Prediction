is
that
the
same
as
active
inducement--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
that
term--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
used?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
we
should
think
that
the
respondents
are
not
liable
for
the
type
of
contributory
infringement
dealt
with
in
sony,
could
this
court
reach
the
question
of
active
inducement
on
this
record?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
you
do,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
just
said--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--could
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--assume,
for
a
moment,
that
we
didn't;
could
we,
nonetheless,
address
the
active
inducement--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you
dealing
with
active
inducement
as
just
a
theoretical
add-on,
or
is
that
a
satisfactory
way
to
resolve
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
understand--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--your
pitch.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
you
think
sony
allowed?
it
talked
about...
if
it's,
what,
capable
of
substantial
noninfringing
use,
it's
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
got
interrupted
a
bit.
tell
us,
in
the
simplest
way
you
can,
what
test
you
think
sony
stands
for
and
how
the
ninth
got
it
wrong,
if
you
believe
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but
active
inducement
is
a
doctrine
that's
been
employed
to
curb
the
intentional
encouragement
of
noninfringing
uses,
isn't
it?
