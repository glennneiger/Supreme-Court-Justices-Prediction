justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not
saying...
now
you're
using
different
tests.
your
test
is
"substantial".
all
right,
on
your
test,
are
we
sure,
if
you
were
the
counsel
to
mr.
carlson,
that
you
recommend
going
ahead
with
the
xerox
machine?
are
you
sure,
if
you
were
the
counsel
to
the
creator
of
the
vcr,
that
you
could
recommend,
given
the
use,
copying
movies,
that
we
should
ever
have
a
vcr?
are
you
sure
that
you
could
recommend
to
the
ipod
inventor
that
he
could
go
ahead
and
have
an
ipod,
or,
for
that
matter,
gutenberg,
the
press?
i
mean,
you
see
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
in
each
case...
for
all
i
know,
the
monks
had
a
fit
when
gutenberg
made
his
press--
[laughter]
--but
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that
it
could
well
be,
in
each
of
those
instances,
that
there
will
be
vast
numbers
of
infringing
uses
that
are
foreseeable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
was
just
limited
to
music.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
i
thought
the
study
was
about
music.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
thought...
i
mean,
you
know,
we've
had
90
briefs
in
this,
and
some
briefs
tear
it
apart,
and
others
support
it,
but
we
also
have
briefs
from
the
aclu
saying
you
could
put
whole
libraries
within
this
system.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you
is,
given
that
concern,
that
there
are,
conceptually
anyway,
really
excellent
uses
of
this
thing,
does
deliberate...
what
is
the
word?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
because
what
you
are
worried
about,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
actual
inducement
would
take
care
of.
and
if
you
sent
it
back
and
said,
"let's
have
a
trial
on
actual
inducement.
"
if
this
really
is
the
extreme
case
you're
talking
about,
why
wouldn't
the
petitioners
here
be
bound
to
win
that
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is...
what
is
the
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question?
i
took
it,
whether...
for
the
last
21
years,
industry
throughout
america
has
taken
the
standard
as
being
approximately
whether
it
is
capable
of
substantial...
commercially
significant
substantial
noninfringing
uses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
and
the
country
seems
to
have
survived
that
standard.
there
is
innovation.
there
are
problems
in
the
music
industry,
but
it
thrives,
and
so
forth.
so
there
is
an
argument
for
just
following
it,
because
it's
what
it
is.
but
suppose
it's
totally
open.
why
should
that
be
the
right
test,
instead
of
some
other
test,
like
substantial
use,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that,
i
think,
was
the
question,
and
i'm
very
interested
in
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
wait.
in
respect
to
that...
i
mean,
is
it
open?
if
you
win
on
the
question
of
the
standard,
is
it
open,
or
would
we
have
to
remand
it
for
them
to
argue,
in
light
of
the
history,
in
light
of
what
they
do
now,
they,
your
client,
with
knowledge
of
infringement,
actively
encouraged
users
to
infringe
copyright
using
their...
using
the
grokster
technology,
and,
indeed,
knowingly
would
include
willful
blindness?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because...
as
i
had
gotten
that
from
one
of
these
amicus
briefs,
you
know,
that's
their
standard...
they
say
a
willful...
of
willful,
deliberate
inducement.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
important
that
they
be
able
to
argue
that.
now,
can
they
argue
it,
in
your
opinion,
if
we
do
nothing
but
affirm
the
ninth
circuit?
