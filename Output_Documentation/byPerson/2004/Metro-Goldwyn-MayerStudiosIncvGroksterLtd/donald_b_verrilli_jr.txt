mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
copyright
infringement
is
the
only
commercially
significant
use
of
the
grokster
and
streamcast
services,
and
that
is
no
accident.
respondents
deliberately
set
out
to
capture
a
clientele
of
known
infringers
to
stock
their
services
with
infringing
content,
they
intentionally
and
directly
promote
the
infringing
use
of
the
service,
they
support
infringing
use
of
the
service,
and
they
directly--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yeah.
yes,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it's
an
absolutely
incorrect
assertion
of
reality,
and
perhaps
i
could
delve
into
it
and
explain
why.
the
evidence
in
this
case,
which
was
presented
at
summary
judgement,
showed
that
90
percent
of
the
material
on
the
services
was
either
definitely
or
very
likely
to
be
infringing.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
this
was
submitted
on
summary
judgement,
your
honor,
and
we
lost
summary
judgement,
so
the
evidence
has
got
to
be
construed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
us.
and
the
ninth
circuit
decided
the
case
on
the
assumption,
we'd
submit,
of
90
percent.
but
with
respect
to
that
10
percent,
what
happened,
and
we
submit
is
completely
wrong,
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
drew
the
inference,
because
it
wasn't
shown
by
our
expert
study,
which,
by
the
way,
is
the
only
empirical
analysis
in
the
case,
to
be
infringing,
that
the
court
could
assume
that
it
was
noninfringing
and
then
extrapolate
from
that
to
a
number
along
the
lines
of
the
number
that
your
honor
suggested.
and
i
think
that
that's
completely
illegitimate
analysis,
factually,
and,
besides,
that
number
is
big
only
because
the
overall
activity
is
so
big.
the
scale
of
the
whole
thing
is
mind-boggling.
if
there
are
that
many
noninfringing
uses--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--imagine
how
many
infringing--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
there...
i
think
it's
quite
accurate
on
the
summary-judgement
record,
and
certainly
drawing
the
inferences
in
our
favor,
as
we
must
here
on
summary...
on
this
summary-judgement
record,
that
there
is
no
commercially
significant
noninfringing
use.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
think,
in
the
context
of
this
record
in
this
case
and
the
business
model
of
these
defendants,
grokster
and
streamcast,
that
that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
think
what
grokster
and
streamcast
are
arguing
is
that
this
court's
decision
in
sony
stands
for
the
proposition
that
their
massive
actual
infringement
is...
gets
a
free
pass,
a
perpetual
free
pass,
so
long
as
they
can
speculate
that
there
are
noninfringing
uses
out
there,
such
as
public-domain
uses
and
authorized
uses.
we
don't
think
that
that...
that
sony
stands
for
any
such
proposition.
we
also
want
to
point
out
that
that
doesn't
help
them...
that
proposition
doesn't
help
them
with
respect
to
one
very
significant
part
of
this
case,
and
that's
the
fact
that
they
intentionally
built
a
network
of
infringing
users,
and
they
actively
encouraged
and
assisted
infringement.
now,
even
if
there
are
commercially
significant
noninfringing
uses,
and
we
submit
there
most
definitely
aren't
under
sony,
but
even
if
there
are,
that's
no
defense
to
a
contributory
infringement
claim
based
on
intentional
building
up
of
an
infringing
business
and
active
encouragement
and
assistance
of
infringement,
and
it
can't
be;
because,
otherwise,
then
the
fact
that
they
had
commercially
significant
noninfringing
uses,
again,
would
be
just
a
free
pass
to
actively
promote
infringing
uses;
not
merely
to
support
them,
but
to
promote
them.
and
so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--the
active-encouragement
aspect
of
our
argument
would
be
the
same,
certainly.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
they
don't
get
a...
they
don't
get
a
free
pass
to
encourage
any
infringement.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
i
think
there's--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--there's
a
lot
of--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
there's
a
lot
of
lingo
floating
around
in
this
case...
inducement,
active
encouragement
and
assistance.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
very
definitely.
i
think...
i
think
the
court,
of
course,
should
find
that
there's
contributory
liability
under
the
sony
theory--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
with
respect
to--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that
theory--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
and
let
me
explain
why.
the
district
court
in
this
case
issued
a
partial
final
judgement,
under
rule
54(b),
granting
the
respondent's
summary-judgement
motions.
now,
we
argued
for
contributory
liability
on
two
theories
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
ninth
circuit.
we
argued
that
there
was
a
lack
of
commercially
significant
noninfringing
use
under
sony,
and
we've
argued
the
inducement
or
active-encouragement
theory.
we
argued
that
both
theories
entitle
us
to
relief
against
the
current
operations
of
the
service,
entitled
us
to
damages,
and
entitled
us
to
injunctive
relief
to
eliminate
the
harmful
ongoing
infringing
consequences
of
this
intentionally
built-up
infringement
machine.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgement
against
us
and
gave
a
clean
bill
of
health,
gave
absolution,
essentially,
to
the
current
versions
of
the
services.
the
only
thing
that
was
left
to
us,
as
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
court...
and
the
district
court,
both,
understood
the
law,
is
that
we
can
go
back
and
try
to
show
that,
with
respect
to
specific
past
acts
of
infringement,
if
we
can
show
that
they
occurred
at
a
time
when
we
had
given
them
notice
that
they
were
about
to
occur,
and
that
we
had
the
power
to...
and
they
had
the
power
to
stop
them
at
the
moment
we
gave
them
the
notice,
that
we
can
get
damages
for
those
specific
things,
and
those
specific
things
only.
that's
all
that's
left
in
this
case.
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear,
from
the
rule
54(b)
certification
order
of
the
district
court
that
it
was
only
damages
with
the
past
services
and
the
past
acts--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--here's
what
i...
here's
where
i
think
the
test--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--right.
here's
what
i...
here's
what
we
think
the
test
is
on
the...
what
we'll
call
the
sony
aspect
of
the
case,
that
it's...
the
question
here
is...
sony
poses
to
us...
is
really
a
touchstone
kind
of
question,
not
a
numerical
kind
of
question.
the
question
under
sony
is
whether
this
is
a
business
that
is
substantially
unrelated
to
infringement.
in
other
words,
are
they
building
their
business
on
supporting
legitimate
activity,
or,
instead,
are
they
building
their
business
supporting
infringing
activity?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
that's
where
you
start.
that's
the
touchstone.
now,
the
numbers,
the
relative
proportions
of
use,
are
relevant.
in
a
case
like
sony
itself,
certainly,
where
the
majority
use
was
noninfringing,
that's
a
legitimate
business;
you
don't
need
to
go
further.
in
a
case
like
this
one,
where,
taking
the
record
at
summary
judgement
in
our
favor,
as
it
must
be,
and
the
ninth
circuit's
assumption
that
you've
got
90
percent
infringing
use,
billions
and
billions
of
acts
of
infringing
use,
and
minuscule
actual
noninfringing
use,
it
seems
to
us
it's
just--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yeah,
i
think
my
answer
to--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--those
questions
are:
yes,
yes,
yes,
and
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
certainly
not...
i
don't
think
there's
any
empirical
evidence
to
suggest,
with
respect
to
any
of
the
things
that
your
honor
just
identified...
and
let
me
pick
out
the
ipod
as
one,
because
it's
the
most
current
example,
i
guess.
from
the
moment
that
device
was
introduced,
it
was
obvious
that
there
were
very
significant
lawful
commercial
uses
for
it.
and
let
me
clarify
something
i
think
is
unclear
from
the
amicus
briefs.
the
record
companies,
my
clients,
have
said,
for
some
time
now,
and
it's
been
on
their
website
for
some
time
now,
that
it's
perfectly
lawful
to
take
a
cd
that
you've
purchased,
upload
it
onto
your
computer,
put
it
onto
your
ipod.
there
is
a
very,
very
significant
lawful
commercial
use
for
that
device,
going
forward.
and,
remember,
i...
what
our
test...
our
test
is
not
"substantial".
our
test
is
that
it's
a...
it's
a...
when
it's
a
vast-majority
use,
like
here,
it's
a
clear
case
of
contribution--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
the
weight--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
here's
why.
to...
it's
not
just
the
absence
of
commercially
significant
noninfringing
uses
that
demonstrates
contributory
infringement.
i
mean,
you
have
to
demonstrate
that
you're
making
a
material
contribution,
with
knowledge
that
you're
doing
so.
the
inventor,
at
the
outset,
is
not
in
that
position.
they're
not
making
a
contribution
with
knowledge
that
they're
doing
so.
do
they
have
absolute
certainty?
no,
they
don't
have
absolute
certainty.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i...
but
the
problem--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
i...
i
think
that
you
have...
to
show
contribution,
you
should
have...
you
have
to
be
making
a
material
contribution,
with
knowledge
that
you're
doing
so.
and
so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
i
don't
think
there's
anywhere
close
to
a
showing...
i
don't
think
there
could
be
anywhere
close
to
a
showing
that
you've
got
the
vast
majority
of
use
from...
for
infringement
from
the
time
that
the
device
comes
out.
i
just
don't
think
that's--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--realistic.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
because
i
don't
actually
think
that
there
is
evidence
that
you've
got
overwhelming
infringing
use.
i
just
think
that's...
it's
not
a...
it's
not
a--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
when
you
get
to
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
when
you
have
vast-majority
infringing
use,
they
should
be
on
the
hook.
now,
i
don't
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--you
have
that
problem--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--with
the
ipod,
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
first
of
all,
i
don't...
i
think
it's
just
counterfactual
to
think
that
there
is
going
to
be
overwhelming
infringing
use
of
the
ipod
in
the
way
that
there
indisputably
is
here.
second,
to
the
extent
you
get
the
closer
cases,
it
is
our
position,
as
i
gather
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states,
that
you
look
at...
to
see
what
kind
of
business
model
the
defendant
is
operating
under.
is
it
a...
is
it...
are
they
marketing
it
for
legitimate
purposes?
are
they
taking
reasonable
steps
to
prevent
infringement?
if
they
are,
then
they...
then
they're
not
liable.
third--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
it
is
an
inducement
argument,
because
it
doesn't
go
all
the
way
to
requiring
us
to
show,
as
we
can
show
here,
that
they've
got
intent.
but
i
do
think
that
the
issue
is,
you
know,
really...
in
the
real
world,
you
know,
it
isn't
the
case
that
these
guys
have
gotten
immediately
sued.
that's
just
not
right.
and
the...
and
the
reality
is
that
what
happens
is
what
happens
here.
there's
perfectly
valid
uses--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
kennedy.
if
there's
vast-majority
infringing
use,
and
you
continue
to
operate
your
business
with
the
knowledge
that
there's
vast-majority
infringing
use,
then
you've
got
liability.
now,
of
course,
we
do
have
all
the
additional
inducement
facts
here,
but
we've
also
got
those
facts.
and
in
the
real
world--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
that
it
is
a...
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--neither,
is
the
answer.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
neither,
is
the
answer.
it
is
a
basis
for
resolving
this
case,
but
not
to
the
exclusion
of
getting
the
law
right
on
sony.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--we
agree
with
that.
we
think,
in
a
situation
where
the
vast
majority
of
the
use
is
infringing
and
there
isn't
any
evidence
of
a
legitimate
business
plan,
on
the
sony
part
of
the
case
we
would
be
entitled
to
summary
judgement.
we
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
that
with
respect
to--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
came
after
the
trial,
that's
right.
but
the...
a
key
point
i
think
i
want
to
make
here
is
that
this
is
not
about
this
technology.
what
happens
in
the
real
world
is
that
inventors
come
up
with
technology.
some
people
use
it
for
lawful
purposes
and
valid
purposes,
as
some
people
use
this
technology
for;
some
people
abuse
the
technology
to
run
business
that...
businesses
that
are
devoted
to
expropriating
the
value
of
copyrights.
that's
exactly
what's
going
on
in
this
case.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
start
by
clarifying
the
inducement
issue,
and
then
explain
why
inducement
is
not
enough,
and
then
have
a
word,
if
i
might,
about
the
reality
of
this
case.
the
reason,
justice
souter,
you
find
it
bizarre
is
because
a
shell
game
is
going
on
here.
what
the
respondent's
position...
excuse
me...
the
respondent's
position
here
is
that
we
can
sue
for
specific
infringements
that
we
can
show
were
induced
by
these
specific
acts,
such
as
e-mail
support.
our
position
on
inducement
is
that
we
are
entitled
to
injunctive
relief
against
the
continued
operation
of
this
gigantic
infringement
machine,
which
was
built
by
the
inducement.
now,
i
think
that
the
respondents
have
quite
clearly
said
that
they're...
they
don't
think
any
injunctive
relief
is
available,
going
forward.
but
we're
entitled,
under
section
502
of
the
copyright
act,
to
effective
relief,
not
merely
a...
relief,
judgement
relief,
that
says,
"go
and
sin
no
more",
but
relief
that
undoes
the
consequences
of
this
inducement,
of
this
massive
effort
to
build
a
gigantic
engine
of
infringement.
and
that
is
why
they're
just
wrong
about
that.
and
you
certainly
can't
affirm
the
ninth
circuit
and
allow
us
to
go
forward
with
anything
like
that
here,
because
the
ninth
circuit
said
the
only
thing
we
can
sue
for...
the
only
thing
we
can
sue
for...
is
a
situation
in
which
we
can
show
that
we
had
knowledge
of
specific
acts
of
infringement
at
a
time
when
we
could
stop
those
specific
acts
of
infringement.
so
there's
just
no
way
to
affirm
and
let
that
go
forward.
now,
why
is
infringement...
why
is
inducement
not
enough?
it's
not
enough
because,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
these
companies
already
operate
in
the
shadows,
and
a
ruling
here,
which
would
be,
i
submit,
a
significant
cutback
of
the
sony
rule,
that
inducement
is
the
only
available
ground
of
liability,
would
just
need
them
to
paper
over...
you
know,
we
do
have
some
paper
evidence
here,
a
paper
trail
here,
but
that'll
just...
they
just
won't
exist
next
time.
and
it's
just...
it's
just
not
enough.
and
i
submit
that
sony
was
quite
clear
on
this.
sony
said
that
the
staple
article-of-commerce
doctrine,
not
copyright
law,
generally,
and
not
secondary
liability,
generally,
but
the
staple
article-of-commerce
doctrine,
the
noninducement
part
of
the
analysis,
has
got
to
strike
an
effective
balance...
a
real
balance
that
provides
effective
protection
of
copyright,
as
well
as
protecting
unrelated
lines
of
commerce.
now,
their
rule
is
a
rule
of
immunity.
it's
a
free
pass.
it
says,
all
you've
got
to
do
is
speculate
about
noninfringing
use,
and
you
can
continue
with
infringement,
ad
infinitum.
and
that's
not
a
rule
that
protects
innovation;
that's
a
rule
that
destroys
innovation.
it
certainly
destroys
the
innovation
that
the
creators
of
the
copyright
law
is
supposed
to
protect,
and
that's
supposed
to
be
the
effective
protection
part
of
the
balance
that
sony
said
this
law
is
supposed
to
strike.
it
also...
it
also
deters
legitimate
technological
innovation
moving
towards
legitimate
means
of
distributing
this...
of
distributing,
in
a
digital
format,
music
and
movies
through
the
kinds
of
companies
that
filed
amicus
briefs
and
that
are
trying
to
do
this
legitimately.
they
are
inevitably
and
invariably
undercut
by
the
kinds
of
businesses
that
respondents
and
the
others
run,
so
it
deters
innovation;
it
doesn't
move
it
forward.
and,
beyond
that,
justice
kennedy,
as
you
suggested,
it
isn't
just
that
they
get
to
use
our
copyrighted...
the
value
of
our
copyrighted
materials
as
the
seed
capital,
that's
the
whole
business.
that
is
the
whole
business.
and
that's
the
reality
here,
and
that's
the
problem.
they
can
talk
about
the
hundreds
of
thousands,
or
maybe
even
millions,
of
uses,
but
the
reality
is
that
there
are
2.6
billion
downloads,
unlawfully,
every
month.
so
what
they're
talking
about
as
lawful
is
a
tiny,
teeny
little
fraction
of
what's
really
going
on
here.
and
the
problem
with
the
rule
which
they
say
is
a
clear
rule,
but
it
obviously
isn't
in
sony,
because
sony
said,
"strike
a
balance".
and
the
problem
with
that
rule,
your
honor,
is
that
it
gives
them
a
perpetual
license
to
keep
going
forward
with
billions
and
billions
of
unlawful
downloads
a
month.
they
never
have
to
do
anything
to
try
to
bring
their
conduct
into
conformity
with
law.
they're
not
in
the
position
of
that
inventor
that
you
identified,
justice
scalia,
who
has
to,
sort
of,
think
through,
"what
am
i
doing"?
they're
just
in
a
position
where
they
have
every
economic
incentive
in
the
world
to
maximize
the
number
of
infringing
uses,
because
they
make
more
money
when
they
do
so.
now,
and
with
respect
to
the
reality
of
this
situation,
let
me
just
say...
and
i
must
beg
to
differ,
justice
breyer,
with
the
suggestion
that
this
industry
is
thriving.
what
the...
the
facts
are
that
we
have
lost...
the
recording
industry
has
lost
25
percent
of
its
revenue
since
the
onslaught
of
these
services.
and
that's
particularly
critical,
because,
remember,
this
is
really...
the
recording
business,
in
particular,
is
really
a
venture-capital
business.
most
of
the
records
we
put
out
don't
make
money.
a
few
make
a
lot
of
money.
well,
what
do
you
think's
getting
traded
on
grokster
and
streamcast
and
the
rest
of
them?
it's
the
few
that
make
all
the
money.
so
they're
draining
all
of
the
money
out
of
the
system
that
we
use
to
find
new
artists
