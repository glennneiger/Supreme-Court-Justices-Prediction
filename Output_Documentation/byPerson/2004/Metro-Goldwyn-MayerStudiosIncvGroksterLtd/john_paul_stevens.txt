justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
for
the
one...
you
said
"the
only
significant
use".
there's
a
footnote
in
the
red
brief
that
says
the
figure
is
some
2.6
billion
legitimate
uses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
correct,
or
incorrect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
was
there
a
finding
of
90
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
goes
to
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--accuracy
of
your
statement
that
there
is
no
other
significant
legitimate
use.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taranto--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
ask...
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled
about
the
posture
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i
read
the
district
court
opinion.
i
think
he
said...
the
judge
said
that
both
parties
agreed
that
there
were
no
disputed
issues
of
fact
that
would
preclude
the
entry
of
summary
judgement
in
either
way,
no
disputed
issues
relative
to
whether
to
grant
relief.
and
i...
it's
on
page
24a
of
the
cert
petition.
and
i
understand
you
to
be
saying
that
leaving
everything
alone,
affirming
would
allow
the
case
to
go
forward
with
your
adversaries
seeking
damages
on
an
active-inducement
theory.
am
i
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
says,
"both
parties
believe
there
are
no
disputed
issues
of
fact
material
to
defendant's
liability.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that,
yes,
if
we
affirm,
as
a
possibility,
they
could
continue
to
seek
damages
on
an
active-inducement
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
one
other--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--question
i
had.
does
the
record
contain
their
proposed
form
of
injunction
that
they
requested?
