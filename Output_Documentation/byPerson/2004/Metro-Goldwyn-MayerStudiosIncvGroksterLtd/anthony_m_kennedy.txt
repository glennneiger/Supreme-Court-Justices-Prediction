it's
not
clear...
it's
not
clear
to
me
from
your
brief,
focusing
on
the
contributory
aspect
of
it,
not...
and
not
the
inducement
part
of
it...
it's
not
clear
to
me
from
your
brief
what
your
test
is.
what
do
we
tell
the
trier
of
fact,
that
if
there
is
a
substantial
part
of
the
use
which
is
noninfringement,
any
part?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
leaving
aside
the
inducement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
we
just
throw
this
to
the
birds
on
the
trier
of
fact
in
every
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
how
do
we
know--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
don't
quite
understand
the...
i
take
it,
inventors
are
profit-motive-driven,
and
if
they
know
that
something
they're
working
on
is
going
to
have
copyright
experience,
you...
copyright
problems,
you
can't
just
say,
"oh,
well,
the
inventor's
going
to
invent
anyway.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
did
i
misunderstand
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
it
is
the
case
under
the
test
you're
submitting
to
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what...
and
your
test
is
whether
there's
a
substantial
use
that's
lawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
owner
of
the
instrumentality,
the
program,
thinks
that
there's
going
to
be
a
vast
area
of
lawful
use,
and
he
knows
that
there's
going
to
be
some
abuse
at
the...
in
the
short
term,
but
he
does
everything
he
can
to
discourage
that.
he
says,
"this
is
a
two...
p2p
is
going
to
revolutionize
the
way
we
talk
to
each
other,
there's
things
in
the
public
domain.
"
"please
don't
use
this
for
copyright.
"
but
he
knows
that
there's
going
to
be
some
infringement,
let's
say,
but
it'll
be
50
percent
of
the
use,
in
the
short
term.
can
he
use
the
program?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
that
he
can--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--use
the
program.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
us
too
far
off
the
track
on
this
question,
but
it
just
seems
to
me
that
what
you've
done
before
bears
on
what
you
know,
or
have
reason
to
know,
on
an
ongoing
basis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
why
don't
you
tell
us
what's
wrong
with
the
government's
test
and
with
the
petitioner's
test,
the
substantial-use
part
of
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
think
it
is
critical
that
the
court
adhere,
for
innovation
protection,
to
the
very
clear
sony
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
what
you
have...
what
you
want
to
do
is
to
say
that
unlawfully
expropriated
property
can
be
used
by
the
owner
of
the
instrumentality
as
part
of
the
startup
capital
for
his
product.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
just
from
an
economic
standpoint
and
a
legal
standpoint,
that
sounds
wrong
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--unlawfully
expropriated
property
can
be
a
legitimate
part
of
the
startup
capital.
