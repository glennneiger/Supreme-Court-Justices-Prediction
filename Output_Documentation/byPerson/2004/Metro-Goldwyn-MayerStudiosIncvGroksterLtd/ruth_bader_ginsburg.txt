but
there
could
be.
there
could
be,
both
with
respect
to
material
in
the
public
domain
and
with
respect
to
people
who
authorize
the
transmission.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
couldn't
get
summary
judgement.
your
reply
brief
said,
"this
case
is
so
clear
that
we
should
get
summary
judgement.
"
if
inducement
is
the
theory...
you
have
just
said,
you
have
to
show
intent--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you
could
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you'd
have
to
go
to
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
sony
itself
had
a
trial--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
full
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there's
more,
they
could
bring
it
out
at
trial,
could
they
not?
the
difference
between
your
position
and
mr.
verrilli,
i
take
it,
is
that
you
think
there
should
be
not
summary
judgement
for
the
petitioners,
but
a
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that,
mr.
taranto,
is
something
i
find
very
puzzling.
there
is
a
statement...
one
could
take
it
as
clear...
"capable
of
substantial
noninfringing
use".
that
would
be
very
clear,
i
agree.
but
sony
goes
on
for
13
more
pages.
if
the
standard
were
all
that
clear,
it
would
have
stopped
there.
and
usually
when
you're
interpreting
a
document,
one
rule
is,
you
read
on,
and
if
you
read
on,
you
find
we
need
not
give
precise
content
to
the
question
of
how
much
use
is
commercially
significant.
that
doesn't
sound
very
clear
to
me.
or
if
you
then
read
back,
as
a
careful
reader
would,
then
you
find
the
statement
that
the
primary
use
of
the
sony
machine
for
most
owners
was
time-shifting,
a
use
that
the
court
found
either
authorized
or
fair,
and,
hence,
noninfringing.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
take
from
what
is
a
rather
long
opinion,
and
isolate
one
sentence,
and
say,
"aha,
we
have
a
clear
rule.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
perhaps
there
should
be
a
trial
so
it
would
all
come
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
weren't
concentrating
on
the
damage
to
them,
they
were
concentrating
on
the
facilitation
of
copying
that
was
provided.
and
you
don't
question
that
this
service
does
facilitate
copying.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
said...
i
think
you
were
saying...
this
is
something
for
congress
to
solve;
it's
not
for
the
court.
but
the
court
is
now
faced
with
two
apparently
conflicting
decisions:
aimster,
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
and
if
you're
just
looking
at
this
in
the
abstract,
you
might
say,
"well,
it's...
isn't
it
odd
that
napster
goes
one
way
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
this
case
goes
another
way?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
taranto,
before
you
go
back
to
that,
i
wanted
to
be
clear
on
what
you
were
saying
would
be
left
over
for
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because,
as
i
read
your
briefing,
it
was,
"well,
they
can
argue
about
some
bad
things
that
grokster
was
doing
in
the
past,
but
this
decision
says:
henceforth,
what
we're
doing
is
okay.
"
"the
case
zeroed
in
on
now
and
the
future,
and
the
only
thing
that
was
left
open
was
something
that
was
over
and
gone
could
get
damages
for
it.
"
but
i
thought
that
this
judgement
gave
you
an
okay,
a
green
light,
from
now
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
one
find
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
motion
itself
is
not
there
to
take
it
through
the
opinion
of
the
court?
