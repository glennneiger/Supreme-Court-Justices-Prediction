mr.
richard
g.
taranto
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
respondent's
software
products
are
tools
of
autonomous
communications
that
have
large
and
growing
legitimate
uses,
their
distribution
is
protected
under
the
clear
sony
rule,
that
rule
should
be
adhered
to
by
this
court,
because
copyright
does
not
generally
step
into
the
role
of
product
control,
because
doing
so
would
cause
overkill.
the
sony
rule
safeguards
legitimate
uses
by
protecting
the
product
and--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--not
in
copyright
law,
it
hasn't,
but
that's
not
my
primary
point.
my
primary
point
is
that
it
is
critical,
it
is
jurisdictionally
critical,
to
separate
two
separate
acts,
distributing
the
product
and
any
of
the
past
acts
that
the
petitioners
allege
constituted
encouragement,
their
synonym
for
"inducement",
which
were
explicitly
outside
the
district
court
ruling
that
was
certified
for
interlocutory
appeal.
questions
about
past
acts
not
inherent
in
the
distribution
of
our
product
remain--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
the
petitioners...
this
is
what
i
think
is
key
or
usable
about
the
past
acts.
they
claim
that
there
is
an
intent,
as
part
of
the
current
distribution
of
the
product,
to
profit
from
increased
use,
including
generically
known
infringing
use,
a
point
on
which
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
to
be
the
case.
beyond
that,
the
question
whether
there
were
encouraging
acts,
any
kind
of
promotional
activity
that
says,
"we
ask
you
to,
and
urge
you
to,
use
this
product
for
infringement.
"
that
is
not
here,
because
that
was
explicitly
part
of
the
past
activities,
removed
from
the
district
court
decision.
and
when
the
petitioners
sought
interlocutory
appeal,
they
said,
expressly,
these
were
"distinct
and
severable",
in
their
terms...
that's
a
quote--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--from
the
past.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
i'm
not.
let
me
try
to
be
clear.
there
is
a
theory,
not
present
here,
along
exactly
those
lines,
which
petitioners
are
entitled
to
argue,
back
in
the
district
court,
without
a
remand,
because
that
issue
remains
in
the
district
court.
it
is
a
theory
that
says,
"you
started
your
business
with
illegitimate
acts,
your
current
business
is
a
causal
consequence
of
that.
"
i
will
say,
there
is
not
one
bit
of
evidence
that
the
petitioners
introduced,
in
resisting
summary
judgement,
in
support
of
that
theory.
it
is,
in
fact,
a
highly
implausible
theory,
for
reasons
that
the
district
court
can
explain,
because
users
of
software
like
this
switch
readily.
there
is
no
plausible
lock-in
effect
to
this
software.
people
go
from
kazaa
to
grokster
to
edonkey
to
bittorrent
week
by
week.
that
was...
that
is
an
available
theory.
you
would--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i'm
not
entirely--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
think...
because
as
the
petitioners
insisted
when
they
pressed
for
interlocutory
appeal,
they
said
these
were
distinct
and
severable,
because,
as
justice
scalia
referred
to
before,
the
important
question,
on
a
going-forward
basis,
is
whether
the
current
set
of
activities...
this
software,
given
how
it
operates,
being
generally
distributed...
is
a
vendor's...
the
distributor
of
that
software...
secondarily
liable
because
somebody
else,
tomorrow,
can
do
exactly
the
same
thing,
without
the
baggage
of
any--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
agree
with
that,
justice
kennedy,
but
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
this
case
was
decided
on
the
assumption,
which
we
are
not
contesting
here,
that
the
respondents
here
knew
that
there
would
be
widespread
infringing
use
of
a
product
that
they
were
putting
out,
and,
what's
more,
that
they
intended
to
profit
from
maximum
use
of
the
product,
which
necessarily
would
include
infringing
use,
which
they
had
no
ability
to
separate
from
noninfringing
use.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
i'm
not
entirely...
i
think
there
are
several
tests,
and
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
them
all
here.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
that
sentence,
justice
ginsburg,
is
expressly
stated
to
be
the
rule
of
law
that
is
being
applied.
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
apply
it
to
say,
there
are
two
things
that
satisfy
the
test.
the
primary
thing,
of
course,
is
what
takes
up
most
of
those
13
pages,
the
question
whether
in-home
time-shifting
is
fair
use,
a
question
that
was
of
considerable
interest
to
tens
of
millions
of
individuals
throughout
the
united
states.
but
the
court,
in
fact,
didn't
rely
only
on
that;
it
said,
"in
addition,
there
was
this
roughly
7
to
9
percent
use
of
authorized
time-shifting.
"
it
wouldn't
have
had
to
even
talk
about
that
if
the
primary
use,
you
know,
was
the
entirety
of--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
will...
let
me
urge
that
there
is,
in
fact,
considerable
weight
to
stare
decisis,
because
there
are
major
technological
industries
that
have
relied
on
the
rule
that
derives
from
patent
law
that
there
is
no,
kind
of,
predominant-use
kind
of
meaning
to
sony
rule.
in
the
patent
context
from
which
this
came,
all
there
has
to
be,
in
professor
chisum's
words,
is,
uses
that
are
not
farfetched,
illusory,
uneconomical
for
the
user.
and
the
inquiry
there
is,
is
this
a
product
whose...
where
the
same
features
that
are
alleged
to
cause
the
infringement
are
also,
in
some
nontrivial
way,
used
for
noninfringement?
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i...
because
i--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--right.
because
i
think
any
alternative
is
worse.
a
focus
on
intent
to
profit
means
that
virtually
every
business
which
requires
money
and
has
the
least
bit
of
sensible
forward-looking
thinking
about
what
the
usage
is
going
to
be
will
be
subject
to
litigation,
arguing
about
their
knowing
that
a
substantial
amount
of
the
value
of
the
product
was
going
to
be
based
on
infringement.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
every--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i...
well--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
about
that
formulation.
sony
clearly
sold
many
more
tapes
because
of
the
illicit
activity
of
library.
sony
presumably
sold
more
machines,
maybe
even
priced
them
higher,
because
there
was
a
group
of
people
who
wanted
the
machine
for
the
illicit
activity.
the
apple
ipod,
in
the
60
gigabit
version,
holds
15,000
songs.
that's--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--a
thousand
cds.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
i...
what
i
think
is
that,
as
a
matter
of
general
judicially
formulated
secondary
copyright
liability
law,
there
is
no
better
policy
balance
that
the
court
can
strike,
and
that
only
congress
can
make
the
judgements
about
what
the
industry-wide
facts
are.
and
i...
let
me
pause
there
a
minute...
there
are
no
industry-wide
facts
in
this
record.
every
citation
in
the
petitioner's
brief
about
the
magnitude
of
harm
to
the
industry
is
extra-record
citation.
there
are
26
billion--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--petitioners...
it's
not
just
that
they
didn't
have
it
in
their
brief,
they
did
not
submit
any
evidence
in
response
to
the
summary-judgement
motion
that
said
the
rule
of
sony
should
be
applied
here
because
the
magnitude
of
the
injury
to
the
recording
industry
or
in...
someday
in
the
future,
to
the
movie
industry,
is
at
zero--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--as
does
the
personal
computer
and
the
modem
and
the
internet
service
provider
and
the
microsoft
operating
system.
there's...
everything
in
the
chain
that
makes
this
work
is
absolutely
essential
to
facilitating
the
copying.
the
question
is
which
pieces,
if
any,
and
under
what
standard,
get
singled
out
for
a
judicially
fashioned
secondary
copyright
liability
doctrine.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
let
me
suggest
why
that's
not
odd
and
why
the
cases
are
not
just
different,
but
critically
different.
napster
rests...
never
mind
the
exact
words
of
the
opinion...
napster
involves
something
more
than
distribution
of
a
product.
napster,
the
company,
was
sending
out,
in
response
to
requests,
"where
is
this
filed",
an
answer,
the
information,
"the
file
is
here".
every
time
it
sent
out
that
information,
if
it
had
been
told
by
mr.
verrilli's
client,
"that
file
may
not
be
shared.
"
it
was,
with
specific
knowledge
to
that
file,
giving
assistance.
that
is
a
classic
contributory
infringement
case
based
on
specific
knowledge
of
infringement.
and
the
reason--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--because
willful
ignorance
is
about
having
possession
of
information
and
refusing
to
look
at
it.
this...
that
does
not
occur
here.
this
tool
of
autonomous
communication
is
one
in
which
there
is
no
mother-may-i
system,
no
chaperone,
no
information
provided
to
us
at
the
time
that
there
is
any
regress.
when
i
ask
for
a
file
from
you,
there
is
no
information
that
goes
back
to
streamcast
or
to
grokster--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
i
think,
on
either
account.
my
understanding
of
where
in
the
law
willful
ignorance
has
bite
is
when
you
do
have
the
information
right
in
front
of
you,
and
you
refuse
to
look
at
it.
and,
what's
more,
the
change
of
system
to
an
autonomous
communication
tool,
where
there
is
no
intermediary,
which
is
what
all
of
their
filtering
systems
would
require,
getting
permission
in
advance,
the
change
of
tool
is
not
just
some
way
of
blinding
oneself
to
the
information.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
right.
and
i
think
that
the
summary-judgement
record
on
this
is...
it,
i
mean,
doesn't
leave
any
real
room
for
dispute.
seeking--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
that
they
can
certainly
argue,
with
an
affirmance
by
this
court,
that
all
of
the
past
acts,
to
use
the
district
court's
term,
constitute
a
basis
for
a...
inducement
liability.
there
would
be
some
legal
questions
about
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
inducement
liability,
but
they
get
to
argue
that.
no
remand
is
required
for
that.
the
record
in
this
case
establishes
that
one
reason
for
going
to
the
decentralized
system,
without
a
central
index
and
a
third-party
intermediary,
was
to...
was
a
reaction
to
the
ninth
circuit's
napster
decision
that
said,
"that's
a
legal
problem".
but
it
is
also,
i
think,
beyond
genuine
dispute,
for
summary-judgement
proposes,
that
there
were
other
reasons.
you
don't
have
to
have
the
servers
to
maintain.
when
streamcast,
in
particular,
was
running
a
napster-like
system,
the
so-called
opennap
system,
it
had
ten
servers,
and
quickly
maxed
out
and
started
crashing,
and
immediately
concluded...
i
think
this
is
at
page
789
or...
and
798
of
the
joint
appendix...
we
would
have
had
to
start
doubling,
tripling,
quadrupling
the
number
of
services,
and
we
didn't
have--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--the
money
to
do
it.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes.
i
think...
all
i
read
this,
page
24a,
to
say
is
that
both
sides
filed
for
summary
judgement,
so
each
one,
of
course,
thought
that
there
was...
that
it
was
entitled
to
summary
judgement.
each--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--i
think
that's
just
because
each
side
filed
summary
judgement.
each
side
filed
extensive--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes,
absolutely.
and
there
are...
there
are
affirmative
defenses
that
are
not
even
part
of
this
motion
that,
of
course,
would,
by
themselves,
preclude
summary
judgement
in
their
favor.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i
don't
think
it
does,
beyond
the
statement
at
the
end
of
their
summary-judgement
pleading
that
asked
for
a
very
general
injunction,
"stop
the
defendants
from
infringing".
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
more
specific.
let
me
comment
a
bit
on
what
the
record
says
about
the
substantial
legitimate
uses.
this
is
not
a
question
of--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
i...
my
view
that...
i
mean,
this
was
not
talked
about
in
these
terms.
i
believe
it
ought
to
be
open
to
the
petitioners,
not
only
to
prove
that
past
acts
were,
themselves,
illegal,
but
that
the
causal
consequence
of
those
past
acts
should
somehow
reach
forward
into
the
current
acts.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
the
point
of
the
current
summary
judgement
is
that
there
is...
the
forward-looking
character
of
the
activities
taking
place,
starting
in
september
2002
on
forward,
has
been
held,
by
itself,
not
to
be
a
basis
for--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--as
i
say,
it
wasn't
stated
in
those
terms,
but,
yes,
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
because--
[laughter]
--because
the
important
question
is,
to
the
petitioners,
the
entire
recording
and
movie
industry,
is
this
set
of
activities,
which
you
and
i,
tomorrow,
can
start
engaging
in,
one
that
they
can
stop?
there
are
literally
a
handful...
on
page
7
and
8
of
their
brief--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
exactly
right.
and
they
would,
of
course,
have
had
to
make
the
very
implausible
assertion,
in
a
business
in
which
there
is
no
plausible
lock-in,
that
somehow
a
set
of
isolated
events...
e-mails...
a
handful
of
e-mails
out
of
literally,
between
the
two
companies,
1700
a
day,
that
might
have
said,
"why
don't
you
load
some
music
out
+/?
"
are
somehow
the
causal...
the
cause
of
what
is
going
on
today.
let
me
say
a
few
words
about
what
the
record
says
about
legitimate
activities.
altnet
is
a
company...
this
is
at
1169
and
70
of
the
joint
appendix...
they
say
that
they
have
distributed,
on
peer-to-peer
systems,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
authorized
songs,
and,
they
say,
millions
of
pieces
of...
of
video
games,
leading
to
sales.
this
is
not
a
trivial
number.
jive,
at
page
67
to
68,
speaks
about
250,000
peer-to-peer
downloads
of
a
music
video.
the
internet
archive,
which
is
talked
about
in
the
record,
and
as
you
now
look
at
what
they
are
on
their
website,
now
lists
some
several
hundred
musical
artists
with
20,000
recordings
which
are
being
put
out
there
for
peer-to-peer
distribution.
the
creative
commons
is
licensing
all
kinds
of
things
for
authorized
public
distribution.
there
are
musical
bands--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--my
understanding--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--my
understanding
is
"some"
is
a
great
understatement,
yes.
the
bands
talked
about
at
159
and
160
to
'70
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
have
authorized
their
live
concert
recordings
to
be
traded
among...
on...
to
be
traded.
the
gigamerica
business
is
in
the
business
of
compiling...
this
is
at
323
of
the
joint
appendix...
of
compiling
musical
recordings
and
other
things
for
authorized
distribution.
the
world
of
music
distribution
and
video
distribution
and
movie-trailer
distribution
and,
in
small
instances
now,
text
distribution,
but
growing,
is
changing
and
making
use
of
this
extremely
innovative,
low-cost
tool.
the
great
innovation
of
this
tool
of
communication--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
well,
we
asked
for
judgement,
in
our
favor
on
their
claim,
that
our
current
activities
constituted
a
basis
for
secondary
liability.
i'm
not
sure
if
the
word
"dismiss"
was--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--they
had
a
generic
claim
about
secondary
copyright
liability.
we
made
the
motion...
or,
actually,
streamcast
made
a
motion
that
said,
"let's
carve
this
piece
out
and
talk
just
about
whether
the
set
of
current
activities
supports
secondary
liability.
"
the
other
side
eventually
agreed
that
that
was
distinct
and
severable
from
their
claim
of
secondary
liability
as
to
past
acts
and
as
to
past
versions
of
the
software,
which
has...
which
has
changed.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
yes,
the
motion...
well,
it...
the
simplest
place,
i
guess,
is
in
the
june
2003
district
court
ruling,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
and
attached
to
the
brief
in
opposition,
ruled
on
the
petitioner's
motion
for
an
interlocutory
appeal
under
1292.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
no,
the
motion
is
not...
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
the...
most
of
the
motions...
in
fact,
both
of
our
summary-judgement
motions
and
their
summary-judgement
motion,
are
in
the
joint
excerpts
of
record
in
the
ninth
circuit,
can
be
found
in--
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
--30
volumes.
mr.
richard
g.
taranto
that...
it
may
give
that
impression
on
those
pages.
later,
the
court
explains
that
it's
ruling
only
on
the
current
versions
of
the
software.
and
then
in
the
june
2003
order,
the
court
was
explicit
in
saying,
"if
i
haven't
been
clear
enough,
let
me
amend
my
june...
my
april
order.
"
which
is
what
you
were
just
reading
from,
"to
make
explicit
the
limitation".
and
we
quote
that
in
our
brief.
the
great
virtue
of
peer-to-peer
decentralized
software
is
that
it
doesn't
require
anybody
to
put
stuff
onto
a
server
and
then
bear
the
cost
of
bandwidth,
of
being
charged
by
the
internet
service
provider
when
a
million
people
suddenly
want
it.
it
automatically
scales.
it...
the
more
people
who
want
it,
the
more
people
will
have
it,
because
it
will
be
out
there
on
a
million
computers.
that
is
an
inherent
distributional
economy,
together
with
the
autonomy
of
the
user,
rather
than
having
a
kind
of
mother-may-i
system,
with
having
to
check
every
communication
through
some
third
party
to
say,
"am
i
authorized
to
make
this
communication.
"
that
are
the
virtues
of
this
system
and
that
make
it
clearly
capable
of
growing
the
already
large
hundreds
of
thousands,
even
millions,
of
uses
that
this...
that
these
pieces
of
software
already
enable
people
to
do.
one
final...
final
word.
we're
not
disputing
that
there
are,
in
an
industry-wide
way,
a
set
of
important
policy
issues
here,
though
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
what
self-help
measures...
digital-rights
management,
encryption,
other
things...
there's
nothing
in
the
record
what...
about
that.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
what
kinds
of
real
industry
harm
is
being
done
by
this.
right?
this
is
all
citations
to
websites
in
their
brief.
these
are
classic
questions
of
predictive
judgement,
industry-wide
judgements
that
congress
should
make
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
problem
in
need
of
solution,
and
what
solutions
ought
to
be
considered,
whether
changing
the
rule
would
have
a
overriding
bad
effect
on
other
industries.
