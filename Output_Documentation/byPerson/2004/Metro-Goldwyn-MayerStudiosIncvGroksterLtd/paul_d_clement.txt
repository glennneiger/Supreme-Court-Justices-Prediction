mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
below
allows
companies,
like
respondents,
to
build
a
business
model
out
of
copyright
infringement
without
fear
of
secondary
liability.
as
long
as
they
avoid
obtaining
actual
knowledge
that
a
particular
customer
is
about
to
infringe
a
particular
copyright,
they
are
free
to
operate
a
system
that
involves
massive
copyright
infringement
with
full
knowledge
that
the
draw
of
the
entire
system
for
customers
and
advertisers
alike
is
the
unlawful
copying.
no
matter
much
how
much
of
that
system--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right,
justice
o'connor.
and
then
i
think
the
court
explained
and
elaborated
that
the
test
is
whether
or
not
there
are
commercially
significant
noninfringing
uses.
and
i
would
say
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
this
case
is
basically
adopt
the
test
of
mere
theoretical
capability
for
noninfringing
use,
plus
maybe
some
anecdotal
evidence.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
the
way
we
would
try
to
articulate
it
is
that
if
the
way
that
the
business
model
of
the
particular
defendant
is
set
up
is
that
they
are
not
involved
in
a
business
substantially
unrelated
from
copyright
infringement,
that
there
should
be
liability
in
that
situation.
and
i
think
in
an
extreme
case
like
this,
where
over
90
percent
of
the
business...
and
i
think
mr.
verrilli
correctly
describes
that
it's
not
a
minimum
of
90
percent;
it's
over
90
percent...
because
the
only
evidence
on
the
other
side
is
anecdotal
evidence
that
there
are
such
things
as
public-domain
works.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
came
from
a
study
by
petitioners'
experts
of
the
actual
operation
of
the
system.
and
what
they
did
is,
they
identified
about
75
percent
of
the
works
as
clearly
infringing
works,
another
15
percent
of
the
works
were
identified
as
very
likely
infringing
works,
then
there
were
10
percent
they
just
couldn't
tell
anything
about.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
the...
it's
not...
the
system
is
not
limited
to
music.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--actual
inducement?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
based
on
our
review
of
the
record...
and
we
haven't
been
able
to
see
the
entire
record...
i
agree
with
you,
the
petitioners
ought
to
be
able
to
win
this
case
on
an
active-inducement
ground,
and
that's
a
narrow
way
to
decide
the
case.
i
do
think,
though,
this
court
might
have
to
say
something
about
the
sony
issue
before
it
reached
that
issue.
and
if
it
did
feel
compelled
to
do
that,
i
think
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
sanction
the
ninth
circuit's
reading
of
sony,
because,
you're
right,
there's
a
theoretical
possibility
that
public-domain
works
can
be
exchanged
on
this
system,
but
it's
also
true
that
this
system
doesn't
have
much
of
a
comparative
advantage
for
trading
in
public-domain
works.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
o'connor,
it
stands
for...
the
test
is
whether
or
not
there
are
commercially
significant
noninfringing
uses.
the
ninth
circuit
got
it
wrong
because
it
thought
that
test
was
satisfied
by
a
combination
of
two
things:
being
able
to
point
out
that
there
were
such
things
as
public-domain
works
or
authorized
sharing
of
the
wilco
album,
for
example,
and
anecdotal
evidence
that
you
could
actually
do
that.
now,
if
that
were
the
right
reading
of
sony,
with
respect,
i
would
suggest
that
footnote
23
of
this
court's
sony
decision
would
have
been
the
sum
total
of
the
court's
analysis,
because
in
that
footnote
the
court
observed
that
there
were
broadcasts
of
public-domain
works.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
if
it's
50
percent
infringement
in
the
short
run?
we
think,
absolutely,
yes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
he
can--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--use
the
program.
i
mean,
as
we
suggest,
if
you're
at
a
50-50...
i
mean,
if
you're
anywhere
below
50
percent,
we
think
that
there
should
be
no
liability
under
the
sony
standard.
if
you're
above
that
level
and
there's
sufficient
evidence
that
you're
really
targeting
infringing
uses,
then
i
think
maybe
there
would
be
liability.
but
in
the
hypothetical
you
suggest,
there
would
clearly
not
be
liability
in
that
situation.
what
we
would
like
to
suggest,
though,
is
there
ought
to
be
enough
room
for...
under
the
sony
test,
before
you
reach
actual
inducement,
to
capture
somebody
where
they've
clearly
set
out,
as
a
business
model,
to
deal
with
the
infringing
uses.
and
the
only
thing
they
point
to
are
the
theoretical
possibility,
anecdotal
evidence,
that
it
could
be
used
for
public-domain
works.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
a
fair
point,
justice
ginsburg.
we're
operating
in
something
of
a
disadvantage,
because
we
haven't
seen
the
entirety
of
the
record.
based
on
the
record
that
i've
seen,
i
think
there's
a
close
case,
unless
perhaps
once
this
court
clarifies
the
legal
standard,
respondents
put
on
additional
evidence.
i
think
this
is
a
close
case,
where
you
actually
could
grant
summary
judgement
in
favor
of
the
petitioners.
but
certainly
we
have
no
objection
to
having
a
trial
on
the
sony
issue
in
this
case.
what
we
object
to
is
the
ninth
circuit
rule,
which,
in
every
case,
is
going
to
obviate
the
need
for
a
trial,
based
on
a
showing
that
there
are
such
things
as
public-domain
works.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
potentially
right--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
that's
why
i
think
it's
important
to
preserve
a
role
for
the
sony
test.
and,
again,
this
court,
in
sony,
could
have
adopted
a
simple
theoretical-capability
test,
but
this
court,
instead,
adopted
a
test
that
required
there
to
be
shown
some
commercially
significant
use
for
the...
noninfringing
use.
and
even
in
the
patent
context,
where
i
think
the
test
is,
and
should
be,
more
demanding,
even
in
that
context,
cases
like
fromberg,
which
we
cite
at
page
19
of
our
brief,
show
that
there
is
an
analysis
to
make
sure
that
the
suggested
theoretical
noninfringing
use
is,
in
fact,
a
practical
use
of
the
item.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
we
have
concerns
about
that,
as
well.
i
don't
know
that
we
would
give
them
ten
years
of,
sort
of,
free
space
to
do
as...
facilitate
as
much
copyright
infringement
as
possible.
i
think
what
we
would
say
is
that
when
you're...
when
a
suit
targets
a
nascent
technology
at
the
very
beginning,
there
ought
to
be
a
lot
of
leeway,
not
just
for
observed
noninfringing
uses,
but
for
the
capacity
of
noninfringing
uses.
i
don't
think,
in
fairness,
that's
what
you
have
before
you
in
this
case,
because
this
is
a
case
where
the
peer-to-peer
technology
was
out
there,
it
was
employed
in
a
particular
way,
with
a
centralized
server,
in
a
way
that
was
actually...
had
a
lot
of
users
involved
in
it,
and
they
were
users
of
the
old
napster
system,
that
had
a
distinct
character.
they
were
using
that
system
for
infringing
copyrighted
musical
works.
and
then
these
individuals
come
along
and
seek
to
capitalize
on
that
market.
that
is
their
business
plan
from
day
one.
and
it's
not
some
newfangled
idea.
the
only
newfangled
idea
here
is
that
if
you
give
something
of
value
away
for
free
by
ignoring
the
copyright
laws,
you're
likely
to
draw
consumers
to
your
site,
and
you're
likely
to
attract
advertisers.
but
that
cannot
be
the
kind
of
innovation
that
we
want
to
further
through
development
of
secondary
liability
into
the
copyright
laws.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
whether
you
call
it
a
flexible
rightness
doctrine
or
you
develop
the
doctrine
in
a
way
that
is
very
forgiving--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--a
brand-new
technology.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
i
mean,
i
think...
the
way
i
would
style
it
is
to
develop
a
substantive
standard
that's
very
forgiving
of
brand-new
technologies
and
allows
people
to
point
to,
in
those
situations,
capabilities
for
future
uses.
i
do
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
was
just
trying
to
articulate
it,
which
is
to
say
that
this
court
has
talked
about
the
capacity
for
noninfringing
uses.
i
think,
with
a
mature
product
like
this,
it's
fair
to
point
to
how
it's
actually
used
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you.
