justice
david
h.
souter
your
argument,
i
take
it,
would
be
the
same
if
the
proportions
were
reversed.
your
argument
with
respect
to...
your
current
argument
with
respect
to
infringing
use
would
be
the
same
if
only
10
percent...
if
it
were
assumed
that
only
10
percent
of
the
use
were
illegitimate
and
infringing.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
go--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let's
go
from
xerox
back
to
your
ipod.
how
is
that
clear
in
the
ipod
case?
i
may
not
understand
what
people
are
doing
out
there,
but
it's
certainly
not
clear
to
me.
i
know
perfectly
well
i
could
go
out
and
buy
a
cd
and
put
it
on
my
ipod,
but
i
also
know
perfectly
well
that
if
i
can
get
the
music
on
the
ipod
without
buying
the
cd,
that's
what
i'm
going
to
do.
and
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
everybody
else
would
guess
that.
so
why,
in
the
ipod,
do
you
not
have
this
damoclean
sword?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
never
evidence
at
the
time
the
guy
is
sitting
in
the
garage
figuring
out
whether
to
invent
the
ipod
or
not.
i
mean,
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
concern.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you're
not
answering...
you're
not
answering
the
question.
the
question
is,
how
do
we
know
in
advance,
on
your
test,
anything
that
would
give
the
inventor,
or,
more
exactly,
the
developer,
the
confidence
to
go
ahead?
as
was
said
a
minute
ago,
he
knows
he's
going
to
be
sued
immediately.
there
isn't
a
product
performance
out
there,
as
there
is
in
this
case.
so,
on
your
substantiality
theory,
why
isn't
it
a
foregone
conclusion
in
the
ipod
that
the
ipod
loser...
or
developer
is
going
to
lose
his
shirt?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
that's
inducement.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
clement,
in
one
way
this
presents
an
easy
case
for
answering
justice
scalia's
question,
but
what
about
a
case
in
which
there
isn't
the
napster
example
to
start
with?
should
there
be
some
kind
of
flexible
rightness
doctrine
in
response
to
suits,
as
justice
scalia
put
it,
against
the
inventor
or
developer
right
out
of
the
box?

justice
david
h.
souter
how
would
you
express
the...
how
would
you
express
that,
that
substantive
standard
that
anticipates,
just
as
you
suggested
we
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
don't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--understand
how
you
can
separate
the
past
from
the
present
in
that
fashion.
one,
i
suppose,
could
say,
"well,
i'm
going
to
make
inducing
remarks
monday
through
thursday,
and
i'm
going
to
stop,
thursday
night.
"
the
sales
of
the
product
on
friday
are
still
going
to
be
sales
which
are
the
result
of
the
inducing
remarks
monday
through
wednesday.
and
you're
asking,
in
effect...
you're
asking
us...
to
ignore
monday
through
thursday.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
was
current...
why
was
inducement,
as
a
current
theory
of
recovery,
even
the
subject
of
summary
judgement?
it
seems
to
me
that
to
make
it
a
summary
judgement
is
implausible
to
a
non
worldly
degree.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
i
thought
you
were
saying
that,
so
far
as
the
inducement
theory
of
recovery
is
concerned--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
only
summary
judgement
that
was
granted
was
with
respect
to
current
acts
of
inducement,
the
way
the
company
is
acting
now,
not
the
way
the
company
was
acting
last
year.
and
my
question
is...
if
that
is
correct,
then
i
don't
see
how
summary
judgement
could
even
intelligibly
have
been
considered.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
this
a
classic
willful-ignorance
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
i
thought
willful
ignorance
was
basically
a
certainty
of
what
was
going
on
without
empirically
verifying
it,
so
as
to,
sort
of,
maintain
the
guise
of
one's
hands
over
one's
eyes.
and
it
seems
to
me,
if
that's
what
it
is,
that's
what
we've
got.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
is
the
point
of
the
current
summary
judgement?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
the
summary
judgement
simply,
in
effect,
says,
"they're
not
doing
anything
wrong
now,
but
we
have
left
open
the
question,
not
merely
of
what
they
have
done
wrong
in
the
past,
but
whether
what
they
did
wrong
in
the
past
can
carry
forward
into
the
future?
"
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
bizarre.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying...
what
it
really
says
is,
"there's
nothing
to
enjoin,
but
there
may
very
well
be
something
to
recover
for--
"
justice
david
h.
souter
--"even
as
to
future
activity".
justice
david

the
second
case
in
which
i
have
the
opinion
to
delivery
is
metro-goldwyn-mayer
studios
against
grokster,
the
number
is
04-480.
this
case
comes
to
use
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondents,
grokster
and
streamcast
are
companies
in
the
business
of
giving
away
software
that
allows
users
to
exchange
electronic
files
across
peer-to-peer
networks,
networks
where
users
computers
communicate
directly
with
each
other
and
not
though
any
central
computer.
the
two
companies
make
their
money
by
being
paid
advertising
through
the
computers
that
use
their
software
but
because
of
the
decentralize
software
design,
grokster
and
streamcast
do
not
know
what
files
their
users
exchange
or
when.
what
they
do
know
however,
is
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
billions
of
files
exchanged
contain
copyrighted
music
and
movies.
both
companies
took
active
steps
to
encourage
copyright
infringement
by
the
users
of
the
free
software.
for
example,
each
distributed
software
of
a
kind
known
as
opennap
which
is
compatible
with
the
napster
file
sharing
service
known
to
be
used
predominantly
for
copyright
infringement.
streamcast
marketed
its
peer-to-peer
software
to
napster
users
as
an
alternative
to
napster
and
grokster
tried
to
divert
internet
search
queries
for
napster
to
its
own
website.
both
companies
provided
technical
support
to
users
who
wanted
help
in
playing
copyrighted
movies
and
music.
the
petitioners
are
a
large
group
of
copyright
holders
which
we
are
calling
mgm
for
short
who
sued
grokster
and
streamcast
and
claimed
that
the
companies
were
secondarily
liable
for
copyright
infringement,
i.e.
that
they
were
responsible
for
the
copyright
infringements
committed
by
the
people
who
used
their
software.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
grokster
and
streamcast
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
in
the
circuit's
view,
the
software
was
capable
of
substantial
lawful
use
such
as
the
exchange
of
public
domain
works
or
the
authorized
copying
of
media
files.
the
circuit
read
this
court's
case
sony
v.
universal
city
studios
as
precluding
secondary
labiality
by
the
provider
of
a
device
with
substantial
lawful
uses.
we
granted
certiorari
and
as
explained
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
in
the
sony
case,
the
manufacturer
of
the
video
cassette
recorder
was
sued
for
the
unlawful
taping
of
broadcast
programs
by
vcr
users.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
manufacturer
induced
infringement
and
there
were
substantial
lawful
uses
for
the
vcr.
we
held
that
the
manufacturer
was
not
liable.
it
had
shown
no
bad
faith
in
distributing
the
vcr
nor
could
bad
faith
be
imputed
solely
from
the
paucity
of
lawful
uses
for
the
device.
but
this
case
is
not
like
sony.
long
established
common
law
principles
indicate
that
one
who
distributes
product
with
a
purpose
such
as
fostering
copyright
infringement
is
shown
by
active
steps
taken
to
promote
unlawful
uses
is
liable
for
the
unlawful
use
that
results.
in
this
case,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
grokster
and
streamcast
each
have
such
a
purpose
and
have
taken
steps
to
induce
copyright
violations.
evidence
shows
that
each
aimed
to
satisfy
the
demand
for
copyright
infringement
in
the
market
of
former
napster
users,
each
promoted
and
profited
from
the
infringing
uses
of
the
software
and
neither
one
made
any
effort
to
stop
the
infringement.
in
light
of
this
substantial
evidence
in
mgm's
favor
on
all
elements
of
the
inducement
theory
of
contributory
infringement,
it
was
error
to
grant
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
two
companies.
the
opinion
does
not
reach
the
further
question
imposed
by
mgm
about
the
sony
rule
that
is
how
much
lawful
use
is
necessary
to
avoid
liability
simply
for
distributing
a
product
used
by
some
others
for
infringement.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
and
for
reconsideration
of
mgm's
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
theory
we
set
out
today.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy
join;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
o'connor
join.
