mr.
hungar,
what
is
the
tentative
decision
the
fcc
has
taken
on
the
dsl
regulation?

even
though--

--telephone
lines
have
always
been
subject
to
common-carrier
regulation.

but
it
seems
to
be
saying,
because
the
cable
companies
do
not
offer
separate
telecommunications
service,
they
don't
have
to
offer
it.

i
mean,
it
just...
it's
almost
question-begging.
it's
peculiar.
