justice
clarence
thomas
these
consolidated
cases
come
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeal
for
the
ninth
circuit.
they
concern
how
the
federal
communications
commission
must
regulate
cable
modem
service.
cable
modem
service
consists
of
the
use
of
cable
television
lines
to
provide
consumers
with
high
speed
internet
access.
the
issue
these
cases
present
is
whether
cable
modem
service
is
telecommunication
service
under
the
communications
act.
if
so,
the
commission
presumptively
must
pursuant
to
the
act
regulate
as
common
carriers
cable
companies
that
provide
cable
modem
service.
common
carriers
must
fulfill
a
variety
of
regulatory
duties
under
the
act.
for
example,
common
carriers
must
charge
just
reasonable
and
nondiscriminatory
rates.
through
notice-and-comment
rulemaking,
the
commission
concluded
that
cable
modem
service
was
not
telecommunications
service
and
therefore,
it
was
not
subject
to
presumptively
mandatory
common
carrier
regulations.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
overturned
the
commission's
ruling.
based
on
ninth
circuit
precedent,
it
held
that
the
commission
could
not
consistent
with
the
act
exempt
cable
modem
service
for
mandatory
common
carrier
regulation.
we
disagree
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
judgment
and
remand
for
the
further
proceedings.
the
commission's
ruling
was
based
on
a
permissible
reading
of
the
communications
act.
under
chevron
u.
s.
a.
inc.
versus
natural
resources
defense
council,
inc.,
if
a
statute's
plain
terms
admit
to
two
or
more
plausible
constructions,
we
must
accept
the
commission's
choice
of
one
of
them
if
the
commission's
choice
is
reasonable.
the
commission's
construction
was
permissible
under
chevron.
the
act
is
ambiguous
about
whether
cable
modem
service
is
telecommunication
service
and
therefore
common
carriage.
the
commission's
interpretation
that
cable
modem
service
is
not
telecommunication
service
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
is
reasonable.
the
act
defines
telecommunication
service
in
relevant
part
as
the
offering
of
telecommunications
for
a
fee
directly
to
the
public.
this
definition
does
not
unambiguously
classify
cable
modem
service
as
telecommunications
service.
cable
companies
used
telecommunications
in
other
words
data
transmission
to
provide
cable
modem
service
but
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
they
offer
telecommunications
along
with
cable
modem
service.
the
high
speed
transmission
used
to
provide
cable
modem
service,
the
commission
reasonably
concluded,
is
simply
one
integrated
component
of
a
single
finished
offering.
here,
internet
access.
functionally
integrated
components
of
finished
products
need
not
be
described
as
being
offered
along
with
the
product.
for
example,
one
would
not
normally
say
that
a
car
dealer
offers
engines
when
it
offers
cars.
moreover,
the
question
here,
whether
the
transmission
is
sufficiently
integrated
with
the
finished
product
so
as
not
to
constitute
a
separate
offering
depends
on
the
particulars
of
internet
and
telecommunications
technology
which
the
commission
is
in
a
far
better
position
to
evaluate
than
we
are.
because
the
statute
does
not
address
whether
the
transmission
component
of
cable
modem
service
is
sufficiently
integrated,
we
should
defer
to
the
commission's
expert
judgment
on
whether
it
is
especially
under
the
given
dynamic
technical
and
complex
nature
of
the
subject
matter.
for
these
reasons
and
others
discussed
in
more
detail
in
our
opinion,
the
commission's
interpretation
is
a
lawful
construction
of
the
act.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
join
as
to
part
one.
