stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the...
what
is
the
data-processing
part?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
guess,
on
that
one,
if,
in
fact,
you
had
a
telephone
system,
and,
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire,
joe
smith,
your
friend,
had
recorded
a
message,--
and
when
you
rang
the
call,
the
service
simply
picked
up
the
message
and
played
it
to
you,
wouldn't
it
still
be
a
telephone
system?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
is
this
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
information
that
other
people
have
stored
otherwise?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
isn't
that
even
more
telecommunications
than
my
answering
service?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
i
pick
up
my
messages.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
yes,
of
course
it
does,
and
so
does
my
answering
service.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
got...
what
about
the
next
one?
you
were
going
to...
what
i
want
to
do
is
write
down
a
list--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
those
things
that
are
not
telecommunications.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
ability
to
engage
or
use
my
e-mail
is
an
ability
to
access
messages
that
other
people,
who
don't
work
for
you,
have
left
for
me.
now,
again,
i
keep
thinking
of
my
answering
machine--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
it
doesn't
seem
very
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
anyway,
what's
the
third
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
indeed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
it
is,
is
a
system
where
i
pick
up
the
phone,
and
what
my
phone
does
is...
let's
say
it
had
the
ability
to
survey
a
number
of
possible
people
who
wanted
to
talk
to
me.
would
that
suddenly
change
it
from
a
phone
to
a
computer
or
an
information
system?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
the
other
people
are
leaving
the
information;
it's
not
the
phone
that's
doing
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rather
like
when
i
phone
europe,
and
they
take
the
message
and
turn
it
into
electronic
packets,
and
they
send
it
all
over
the
world
and
on
computers
and
so
forth,
and
it
comes
back
to
me
eventually,
sounds
a
lot
like
my
brother-in-law.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
does
have
this,
that
what...
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
"telecommunications",
it
means
"transmitting
information
without
change
in
the
form
or
content
of
the
information.
"
now,
in
respect
to
some
of
their
services...
not,
maybe,
a
lot,
but
in
response
to
some...
they
certainly
change
the
content
and
the
form.
e-mail,
for
example,
does.
and
there
are
a
number
of
others
that
do.
so
the
language,
says
the
fcc...
i
look
to
"telecommunications
service".
they
provide
telecommunications
service
sometimes,
and
sometimes
this
other
thing,
as
well,
and
it's
all
bundled.
and
we
read
the
word
"offering"
to
mean
"offering
separately".
and
so,
therefore,
a
person
who
offers
only
a
bundled
service
is
not
a
person
who's
offering
a
telecommunications
service.
that's
how
i
read
it,
as
trying
to
understand
their
argument.
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
argument
is
logical,
and
it
fits
the
language.
now,
why
is
it...
are...
do
you
agree
that
it
is
logical
and
fits
the
language,
and
at
least
get
them
that
far,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
xxx--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
but
they
say
we
have
the
authority,
if
they...
if
there
is
a
bundled
service,
by
looking
at
the
competitive
necessity,
market
power,
the
need
to
protect
consumers,
to
insist
that
an
offeror
of
bundled
service
split
the
bundle
and
then
be
regulated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
they're
replying
to
your
argument,
and
they're
saying
it's
really
not
right
that
this
means
no
regulation.
and
the
reason
it
means
no
regulation
is
because
they've
long
had
the
authority
to
do
this,
and
then
they
cite
some
references
where
that
is
pretty
much
what
the
commission
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
take
them
as
having
a
broad...
if
you
take
the
statute
as
throwing
this
whole
problem
in
the
lap
of
the
commission--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
then
you
say
they
have
authority,
broadly,
to
interpret
this
term
"offer",
they
could
give
functional
reasons,
as
in
some
circumstances,
to
interpret
the
word
"offer"
to
mean
"offer
telecommunications
separately",
and,
in
other
circumstances,
because
they're
functional
differences,
to
take
a
different
position.
now,
either
they
do
or
they
don't.
if
they
don't,
they're
being
inconsistent,
and
that's
the
subject
of
a
different
legal
proceeding.
if
they
do,
so
be
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
congress
thinking,
quite
honestly,
if
they...
people
do
think
about
it.
i
have
no
idea
how
broadband
service
will
be
provided
20
years
from
now.
there
may
be
a
thousand
competitors.
there
may
be
wireless.
people
may
be
broadcasting
it
through
their
teeth.
i
don't
know--
[laughter]
--what
it's
going
to
be.
but
since
i
don't
know
and
have
really
no
idea
whether
it
should
or
should
not
be
regulated,
because
i
don't
know
the
competitive
situation,
let's
leave
it
up
to
the
fcc.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
sort
of
it
did
that
in
broadcasting,
didn't
it?
i
guess
they
could
have
written
it
to
say
that
"the
fcc
shall
regulate
common-carrier
communications
in
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
"
which
would
put
the
fcc
in
the
same
situation
with
regard
to
this,
as
it's
in
with
regard
to
broadcasting.
