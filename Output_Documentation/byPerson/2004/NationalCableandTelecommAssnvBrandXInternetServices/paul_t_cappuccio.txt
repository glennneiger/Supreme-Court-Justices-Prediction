mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
trying
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question.
the
question
here,
justice,
is,
are
we
offering
two
products,
or
are
we
offering
two
ingredients
that
come
together
to
form
a
separate
product?
and
i
would
submit
that
if
you
go
back
and
read
paragraph
120
of
the
computer
ii
order,
1980,
that's
exactly
what
congress
said
was
happening.
what
congress
said
is,
when
you
take...
not
congress,
i'm
sorry;
the
fcc,
of
course...
when
you
take
the
communications
component
and
the
data-processing
component
and
combine
them,
they
are
ingredients
into
what
is
a
new
offering,
and
a
new
and
unregulated
offering.
they
said,
"we
can't
separate
them.
"
"it's
not
useful
to
try
to
separate
them.
"
"and
we
view
them
as
two
ingredients,
forming
a
product
that
is
a
distinct
product.
"
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
in
the
case
of
cable
modem
service,
your
honor,
it's
a
number
of
things.
it's
the
ability
to,
for
example,
retrieve
information
from
a
server
that
somebody
has
on
the
web--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--well,
i
think
in
your
situation...
in
the
hypothetical
you
give,
your
honor,
that
would
be
somebody
using
just
a
regular
transmission-only
path
to
hear
what
the
other
person--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--well,
because
here,
in
the
example
that
i
used,
for
example...
it's
certainly
not
the
only
one...
it
is
the
capacity
to
retrieve
information
that
is
stored
otherwise.
and
that
follows,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--yes.
and
not...
and
not
necessarily--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--well--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--i
would
say,
your
honor,
for
one
thing,
it
fits
squarely
within
the
definition
of
information
service,
which
says--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--well--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--okay.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
it's
the
ability
to
engage
in...
to
use
your
e-mail,
it's
the
ability--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--right.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
right.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
well,
it's
anything
that
allows
you
to
browse
the
world
wide
web
and
to...
and
to
retrieve
information
from
the
world
wide
web.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
right.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
the--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--your
honor,
the
ability
to
retrieve
information
that
is
stored
somewhere
out
on
a
server
is
not
the
raw
transmission
functionality.
it
is
more
than
that.
it
is
what
the
congress
has
said
it
is,
it
is
the
ability
to
retrieve
information.
it
is
not
simply
sending
bits
over
a
line
and
having
those
bits
not
changed
and
not
interfered
with.
when
you
retrieve
something
from
a
server,
you
have
to
take
it
in
form
it
is
on
the
server,
you
have
to
then
put
it
through
the
transmission
system,
and
you
have
to
reconvert
it
back
into
what
you
want
to
see.
it's
an
interactive
process
that
is
more
than
just
sending
information.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
yeah,
i
guess...
look,
your
honor,
i
am
not
disputing
that
an
information
service
has
a
component
of
it
that's
communications.
it
may,
indeed,
have
a
component
of
it
that's
communication.
but
what
the
fcc
said
in
computer
ii
is
that
when
you
combine
the...
you
combine
the
communications
with,
for
example,
the
data-retrieval
function,
that
that
combination
of
things
is
no
longer
the
two
separate
products,
it
is
a
new
enhanced
service
that
is
beyond
title
ii.
and,
justice
scalia,
part
of
the
evidence
that
these
are
not
two
separate
products
is,
if
they
were,
then
congress
never
could
have
said
if
enhanced
services
were
outside
of
title
ii.
computer
ii
would
have
to
be
wrong
and
overruled,
even
though
it's
now
20--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--yeah,
i'm
sorry,
i
keep
saying
congress;
i
meant
the
fcc.
the
fcc
could
not
have
said
that,
because
it
would
have
been
forced...
if,
as
the
theory
goes,
the
enhanced
service
has
in
it
the
separate
product
of
communications
and
has
a
separate
status,
then
they
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
take
it
out
of
computer
ii.
but
let
me
suggest,
stepping
back
for
a
second...
and,
by
the
way,
i
should
add
that
in
this
case,
in
the
paragraph
39
of
the
order
under...
below,
the
fcc
said
the
two
were
not
separable.
okay?
i
understand
that
to
mean
they
are
ingredients
intertwined,
they
are
not
separate
products.
but
the
basic
thing
that
the
agency
did
here
was
to
decide
which
of
two
things
is
happening.
are
these
two
separate
products?
is
this
communications
and
chicken
mcnuggets
being
bundled
together?
or
are
these
two
ingredients
that
are
so
interwoven,
as
they
said
in
computer
ii,
as
to
form
a
distinct
product
+/?
is
a
classic
example
of
what
an
agency
does,
and
it's
really
not
one
that
this
court,
i
think,
would
be
likely
to
secondguess.
it
is,
indeed,
in
fact--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--yeah.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
let
me
try
to
clarify
that,
justice
souter.
the
reason
why
dsl
meets
the
definition
of
"telecommunications
service"
and
we
don't
is
because
the
telephone
companies
do,
in
fact,
provide
the
transmission-only
component.
now,
the
reason
they
do
that,
justice
souter,
is,
as
mr.
hungar
said,
historical,
though
it
wasn't
without
basis
in
reasons
in
history,
but
they
do,
in
fact,
provide
it
separately.
they
do,
because
congress
required
them
to
do
it
through
a
separate
subsidiary
in
computer
ii.
there
were
reasons
for
that.
they
wanted
to
avoid
cross-subsidies,
they
were
the
only
platform,
they
were
worried
about
discrimination.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
i
would...
i
read
the
statute
this
way.
congress
takes
the
world
as
it
comes.
if
you
are
providing
it
as
a
common
carrier,
then
you
fall
within...
you're
providing
it
separately...
then
you
fall
within
the
definition
of
"telecommunications
service".
the
dsl
guys
are.
if
you
are
not,
and
we
are
not,
then
you
don't
fall
within--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--it
just
says
that
it's
for
someone
else
to
decide
the
second
prong
of
the
naruc
test,
which
is,
should
you
be
compelled?
okay?
the
congress
doesn't
decide
that.
it's
crazy
to
think
that
congress
decided,
forever
and
ever
and
ever,
that
everybody
who
came
in
would
be
a
common
carrier,
no
matter
what
the
market
looked
like.
congress,
instead,
took
the
world
as
it
came,
and
it
relies
on
the
fcc
to
decide
whether
you
should
be
compelled,
under
the
second
prong
of
naruc,
to
be
a
common
carrier.
they
have
declined,
in
this
case,
to
extend
that
to
us.
that,
i
would
say,
is...
you
know,
that's
entitled
to
the
utmost
deference.
it's
a...
deciding
not
to
extend
their
own
rules.
and
there
are
perfectly
fine
reasons
for
that.
the
reasons
that
pushed
them
to
do
it
in
1980
to
the
telephone
companies,
about
cross-subsidies,
have
no
application
to
us.
and
the
discrimination
justifications
back
then,
when
there
was
only
one
platform,
had
no
application
to
us.
now,
you
may
say,
is
this
an
odd
result
that
it
comes
out
differently
at
the
end?
well,
it
is,
and
it
is
being
dealt
with.
the
fcc
is
in
the
process
of
reconsidering,
in
the
wireline
order,
wireline
nprm,
whether
it
still
makes
sense
to
use
computer
ii
to
impose
a
common-carrier
obligation,
an
obligation
to
do
it
separately,
to
provide
the
communications
separately,
on
the
telephone
companies.
if
they
decide
that
no
longer
is
the
case
and
that
they
don't
have
to
provide
it
separately,
and
the
telephone
companies
stop
doing
that,
they
will
no
longer
fall
within
the
definition
of
"telecommunications
service"
under
the
statute.
in
other
words,
the
statute
asks,
what
are
you,
in
fact,
doing?
there
are
two
ways
you
could
be
providing
it
separately:
if
you
choose
to
it
or
if
you're
forced
to
do
it.
we've
done
neither.
the
telephone
companies
have
been
forced
to
do
it.
congress
has...
and
they've
decided
we
shouldn't
be
forced
to
do
it,
and
they're
entitled
to
deference
on
that.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
okay,
let
me
try--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--because,
your
honor,
it's
whether
the
words
"offering
telecommunications"
are
ambiguous.
if
i...
if
i
bake
cakes,
and
someone
was
to
say,
"if
you
offer
cakes,
you
don't
offer
butter.
"
there's
nothing
in
the
english
language,
justice
scalia,
that
makes
that
unreasonable,
that
a
person
who
offers
cakes
to
the
public
does
not
offer
butter
to
the
public.
and
if
you
believe
that
example
is
correct,
then
you
have
to
uphold
the
fcc,
because
what
it
says
is,
the
offer
of
the
final
product
is
not
offering,
to
the
public,
the
ingredient.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
separately.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
separately.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
but,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--the
ilecs
do,
we
don't.
