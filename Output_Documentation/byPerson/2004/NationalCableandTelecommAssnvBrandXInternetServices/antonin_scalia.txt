justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
is
that
reasonable?
i
mean,
why
is
it
offered
to
the
public
if
it's
offered
alone,
but
it's
not
offered
to
the
public
if
it's
offered
with
a
tie-in?
i
mean,
if...
you
know,
if
i
say,
you
know,
i'm
selling
you
a
windshield
alone,
i
guess
i'm
offering
a
windshield.
but
if
i
say,
you
know,
you've
got
to
buy
the
windshield
with
a
car,
am
i
any
less
selling
you
a
windshield?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
suppose
i
just
tie
it
in
with
windshield
wipers.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
only
buy
my
windshield
if
you
buy
the
windshield
wipers
with
it.
am
i
no
longer
selling
a
windshield
because
i'm
selling
it
with...
only
with
windshield
wipers?
justice
antonin
scalia
fifty-fifty.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
don't
you
think
that
the
telecommunications
aspect
of
what's
going
on
here
is
at
least
as
important
as
the
information
aspect
of
it?
the
information
is
useless
unless
it
can
be
conveyed.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
necessarily.
you
could...
you
can
use
that
broadband
service
to
go
to
other
information
providers.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree,
but
the
question
isn't
whether
it
doesn't
do
anything;
the
question
is
whether
you
are
still
offering
telecommunications
services
to
the
public.
and
it
seems
to
me...
look
it,
i
offer
you
broadband,
initially
without
any
information
function
at
the
end
of
it,
and
you're
using
this
broadband
to
do
all
sorts
of
good
stuff,
going
where
you
want,
getting
what
you
want,
conveying
what
you
want.
and
then
i
change
my
rules
and
i
say,
"you
know,
in
the
future
the
only
way
i'm
offering
this
broadband
is
if
you,
in
addition
to
buying
the
broadband
communications
capacity,
buy
my
information
technology
at
the
end
of
it.
"
have
i
suddenly
stopped
selling
the
broadband...
or
offering
the
broadband
to
the
public?
i
just
don't
think
that's
a
reasonable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--use
of
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
giving
you
a
hypothetical.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
if
you
do
the
same
combination
over
telephone
lines,
you
say
they
are...
they
are
selling--
justice
antonin
scalia
--offering
to
the
public
communications
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
bearing
does
history
have
upon
the
definitional
question
of
whether,
when
you
sell
a
bundled
offering
of
information
technology
and
communications,
you
are
selling
communications?
justice
antonin
scalia
with
respect
to
the
telephone
long-lines,
you
say,
yes,
you
are;
and
with
respect
to
cable,
you
say,
no,
you
aren't.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they're
saying,
but
they're
doing
it
all
on
policy
grounds.
this
definition
means
this,
because
that
produces
a
good
result.
with
respect
to
telephone
lines,
they
say,
yes,
bundled
is,
or
it
isn't,
depending
upon
whether
we
like
the
result
it
produces.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
doesn't
seem
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
wonderful
policy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
wonderful
policy,
but
i
don't...
what
i'm
still
waiting
to
hear
is
how
you
get
that
out
of
the
definitions,
which
is
the
lever
that
the
commission
is
using
to
implement
this
good
policy.
it
is
saying,
in
some
cases,
that
a
bundled
offering
is
an
offering
of
telecommunications;
and,
in
other
cases,
it's
saying
a
bundled
offering
isn't.
and
the
reason,
you
say,
is
not
because
of
the
nature
of
the
thing,
because
of
the
definition,
it's
because
you
tell
us
it
has
good
consequences
in
one
case,
and
doesn't
have
good
consequences
in
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
my
understanding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
how
definitions
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
claim
that
that's
by
toleration
of
the
fcc.
i
was
going
to
ask
them
about
that,
don't
worry.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
the
fcc--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
still
doesn't
explain...
it
still
doesn't
explain,
to
my
satisfaction,
why
it
becomes
a
different
product--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
different
product
when
you're
selling
it
separately,
and
it
is
not
a
different
product
when
you're
not
selling
it
separately.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
you
also
sell
butter.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
sell
butter--
justice
antonin
scalia
--separately,
then
when
you
sell
a
cake--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
selling
butter.
