justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
effect,
it's
the
unbundling
requirement
which
is
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's...
why
should
that
make
a
difference?
i
mean,
you
could
just
as
well
make
an
unbundling
requirement
with
respect
to
cable.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
reason
for
a
distinction,
at
least
at
the
present
time...
the
reason
for
the
reasonableness
of
the
distinction
at
the
present
time,
as
a
source
of
applying
this
definition,
is
history,
basically.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
i
mean,
i
think
the
difficulty
that
we're
having
is
that
it
says
it
in
the
cable
context,
and
then
it
doesn't
say
it
in
the
wire
context.
and
you
can
say
it
just
as
intelligibly
in
the
wire
context.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
just
that
you
haven't
been
saying
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
is
that
really
the
nub
of
the
difference?
it's
congress
that
is
requiring
them
to
do
it
separately,
and
congress
doesn't
have
a
comparable
requirement
with
respect
to
cable.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
that
begs
the
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
begs
the
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
basically,
you're
saying
interstitial
lawmaking,
like
other
kinds
of
lawmaking,
can
be
reasonable
without
being
absolutely
consistent
at
a
given
moment.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
but
they're
saying
if
telecommunications
and
something
else
is
involved,
and
that's
what
you
offer,
you
are
not
offering
a
telecommunications
service.
that's
their
definition
of
"offer",
as
"offer
telecommunications
service
separately".
it
would
be
obvious,
for
example,
if
you
service
were
by
phone,
to
connect
with
the
library
of
congress
and
you
owned
the
library
of
congress,
as
well
as
owning
the
dedicated
line.
then
what
you're
doing
is
selling
information
across
the
line.
so
they
say
that's
what
they're
doing,
but
just
not
as
much.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
butter
on
the
cake,
not
in
the
cake.
