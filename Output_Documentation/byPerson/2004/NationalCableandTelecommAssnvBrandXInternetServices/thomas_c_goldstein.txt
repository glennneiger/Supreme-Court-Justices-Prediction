mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
will
want
to
have
handy,
i
think,
the
red
brief
of
the
respondents
earthlink,
et
al.,
because
i
will
repeatedly
take
you
to
the
text
of
the
statute,
which
is
reproduced
at
the
appendix
to
that
brief.
mr.
chief
justice,
cable
modem
service
refers
to
the
bundled
sale,
purely
for
marketing
reasons,
of
two
different
things:
highspeed
telecommunications
over
cable
wires,
and
computer
software,
like
e-mail,
that
you
can
access
over
that
highspeed
telecommunications.
the
commission
admits...
and
it
is
a
critical
admission...
that
the
standalone
sale
of
the
telecommunications
piece
is
a
telecommunications
service,
notwithstanding
that
it
is
on
cable
wires
rather
than
telephone
wires.
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
held
that
it
makes
no
difference
that
cable
companies
market
the
telecommunications
with
e-mail
and
the
like.
congress
cannot
have
intended
to
empower
carriers
to
deregulate
themselves
through
the
nicety
of
adding
some
further
feature
to
their
common
carriage.
and
i
think
we
can
demonstrate
that
through
the
text
of
the
statute.
i'd
like
to
take
you
to
two
provisions
at
the
outset.
the
first
one
is
on
2a
of
the
appendix,
and
it
goes,
justice
souter,
to
the
question
of
whether
there's
some
difference
that
congress
has
adopted
between
telephone
wires
and
cable
wires.
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
no.
subparagraph
46,
the
definition
of
"telecommunications
service",
this
is
the
provision
that
leads
to
common-carrier
regulation.
the
term
"telecommunications
service"
means
"the
offering
of
telecommunications
for
a
fee
directly
to
the
public
or
to
such
classes
of
users
as
to
be
effectively
available
directly
to
the
public.
"
--and
here
is
the
critical
clause...
"regardless
of
the
facilities
used".
congress
made
quite
clear
it
was
not
drawing
any
distinction
based
on
cable
wire
versus
telephone.
i'd
like
to
point
you
to
two
other
provisions.
they
are
not
reproduced,
because
they're
in
the
cable...
separate
cable
provisions,
but
they
will
be
relevant
to
your
question.
that
is
47
usc
541(d)
and
522.
those
specifically
contemplate
that
cable
companies
will
be
common
carriers.
now,
that's
the
answer
to
the
question,
is
there
a
difference
between
a
cable
wire
and
a
telephone
wire?
let
me
now
step
back
to
what
the
fcc
said
in
its
ruling.
the
fcc
backed
into
its
decision
here,
and
it
will
turn
on
the
definition
of
1a
of
the
appendix.
it
said
this.
look,
cable
modem
service
fits
within
the
definition
of
an
"information
service".
it's
this
bundled
thing.
and
we
construe
the
definition
of
an
"information
service"
to
be
mutually
exclusive
of
a
telecommunications
service.
and
that
is
legal
error.
and
let
me
take
you
through
the
definition.
subparagraph
20,
information
service.
the
term
"information
service"
means
the
offering
of
a
capability
for,
in
a
variety
of
things...
generating,
acquiring,
storing,
transforming,
processing,
retrieving,
utilizing,
or
making
available
information...
via
telecommunications.
that
is
not
language
of
exclusivity;
it
is
language
of
dependence.
there
has
to
be
telecommunications
involved.
if
you
all
came
to
the
court
today
via
car,
or
i
came
via
metro,
there
was
a
car
or
a
train
involved.
now,
i
want
to
contrast
that
with
another
series
of
statutory
provisions.
and
what
these
provisions
do
is
demonstrate,
beyond
peradventure,
that
congress
address
the
problem
you
are
now
facing.
it
said,
"we
recognize
that
there
are
definitional
provisions
that
might
otherwise
fall
within
the
definition
of
"common
carriage".
"
and
if
we
don't
want
it
to
be
a
common
carrier,
we
will
tell
you
expressly.
there
are
four
of
them.
they
are
reproduced.
again
at
1a,
the
definition
of
a
"common
carrier".
it's
the
exclusion
that
appears
at
the
bottom
of
the
definition,
three
lines
from
the
bottom,
"but
a
person
engaged
in
radio
broadcasting
shall
not,
insofar
as
such
person
is
so
engaged,
be
deemed
a
common
carrier.
"
there's
nothing
like
that
for
"information
services".
there's
going
to
be
one
specific
table
that
i
think
will
be
particularly
illustrative.
the
next
one,
the
definition
of
a
"telecommunications
carrier".
it's
at
2a.
there's
a
specific
exclusion.
telecommunications
carrier,
these
are
the
people
that
are
common
carriers.
the
term
"telecommunications
carrier"
means
"any
provider
of
telecommunications
services
except.
"
--so
congress
drew
this
out...
"except
that
such
term
does
not
include
aggregators
of
telecommunications
services.
"
the
next
two,
and
they
are
the
final
two,
are
at
8a,
one
that
deals
with
private
mobile
services...
it's
denoted
subparagraph
2...
"a
person
engaged
in
the
provision
of
a
service
that
is
a
private
mobile
service
shall
not,
insofar
as
such
person
is
so
engaged,
be
treated
as
a
common
carrier
for
any
purposes
under
this
act.
"
there's
a
definitional
category
of
"private
mobile
service".
we
don't
want
it
to
be
common
carriage.
and
the
final
one
is
the
cable
one,
and
i
think
it's
very
illustrative...
right
below
that,
subparagraph
c...
"any
cable
system
shall
not
be
subject
to
regulation
as
a
common
carrier
or
utility
by
reason
of
providing
any
cable
service.
"
nothing
at
all
about
an
information
service.
justice
scalia,
you
are
quite
right,
this
is
a
case
about
a
statute,
and
the
language
has
none
of
the
indications
that
the
commission
is
relying
on
here.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
all
right,
let
me
take
you
through
both
parts.
telecommunications...
we're
going
to
talk
about
the
definition
of
"telecommunications"
and
what
it
is
to
"offer".
they
are
wrong
in
suggesting
that
there
is
not
telecommunications
here,
and
i
can
prove
it
two
ways.
the
first
is,
remember,
"telecommunications"
is
the
phrase
in
the
definition
of
"information
service",
as
well.
let
me
take
you
back
to
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
1a.
the
term
"information
service"
means
"the
offering
of
a
capability
for
xxx
via
telecommunications.
"
they're
categorizing
this
thing
as
an
information
service,
so
they
have
to
be
acknowledging
there's
telecommunications
involved.
so,
obviously,
cable
modem
service--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--let
me
explain
why
i
answered
them
separately.
because
the
commission's
argument...
if
this...
chenery...
you
have
to
review
a
commission
decision...
the
commission's
argument
was
that
there
was
no
telecommunications
involved.
this
is
a
different
argument
from
the
fact
that
there
is
no
offering.
that
appears
in
the
solicitor
general's
reply
brief.
so
i
wanted
to
bracket,
set
aside.
it
says,
"that
can't
be
right.
"
"the
commission
is
ruling
based
on
a
pure
legal
error.
"
let
me
turn
to
"offering".
we're
the
only
ones
that
have
provided
a
straightforward
dictionary
definition
of
"offering".
an
"offering"
is
to
make
something
available.
and
you
say,
"all
right,
is
the
bundle
making
available
the
telecommunications?
"
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
yes.
at
the
very
least,
it's
yes
in
the
context
of
this
statute,
which
is
a
common-carriage
statute.
imagine
the
following
hypotheticals,
justice
breyer.
pick
any
form
of
common
carriage
you
want.
if
someone
said,
"i'm
not
just
giving
you
the
railroad
bridge,
but
i'm
also
selling
you...
you
have
to
buy
from
me
the
train
that's
running
on
it
and
the
grain
that's
in
the
train.
"
you
couldn't
avoid
common
carriage
by
forcing
your
customers
to
buy
the
unified
package
together.
the
second
point
is
that,
remember,
the
great,
great,
great
majority
of
communications
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
information
services.
i
have
cable
modem
service.
lots
of
people
do.
what
do
i
do?
i
get
up
in
the
morning,
and
i
go
to
[newyorktimesdotcom,]
i
go
to
[supremecourtusdotgov.]
you'll
be
pleased.
i--
[laughter]
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
they're
offering.
i
don't
use
the
e-mail
program
that's
offered
to
me
by
star
power.
i
have
my
own
e-mail
program.
it's
true,
they've
given
me
some
extra
stuff,
but
one
thing
that
you
know
for
sure
is
that
doesn't
deny
that
they
have
given
me,
fundamentally,
the
capability
to
send
the
information
back
and
forth.
nothing
changes.
and
i
can
illustrate
this
for
you.
remember
the
concession
that
i
started
with.
they
admit
that
if
they
sell
it
alone,
then
that's
a
telecommunications
service.
they
say
it
makes
it
different...
a
difference
that
you
market
them
together.
but
if
i
get
one
bill
for
that
or
two
bills
for
that,
it
works
just
the
same.
i
send
the
information
back
and
forth,
over
and
over
again.
there
is
absolutely
no
difference.
now,
justice
souter,
i
want
to
come
back
to
history,
because
that's...
seems
to
me
the
leg
that
they
hope
that
they
have
to
stand
on.
i
certainly
don't
think
they
have
a
textual
leg
to
stand
on.
let
me
make
some
points
about
the
history.
the
context
for
this
is
the
computer
inquiries
and
the
modified
final
judgement
under
at&t,
and
they
are
simply
misdescribing
the
history.
and
i
will
take
you
to
the
actual
quotes
for
what
happened.
first,
let
me
take
you
to
the
definition
of
a
23
of
our
brief.
and
the
point
i'm
going
to
make
through
this
is...
what
the
commission
said
over
and
over
and
over
again
under
the
computer
inquiries...
is
this,
if
you
have
a
telecommunications
piece,
we're
going
to
call
it
a
"basic
service".
if
you
add
information
processing
on
top
of
that,
we're
going
to
call
the
whole
thing
an
"enhanced
service".
so
far,
everybody's
on
the
same
page.
but
the
piece
that
they're
leaving
out
is
that
they
made
different
decisions,
policy
decisions,
justice
scalia,
about
how,
ultimately,
to
regulate
them,
but
the
definition
never
changed.
if
you
added
the
enhancement
on
it,
just
like
you
add
the
e-mail
on
top
of
it,
you
still
had
the
basic
service.
so
here's
the
quote.
it's
at
23
of
our
brief.
"we
find
that
basic
service
is
limited
to
the
common-carrier
offering.
"
--they're
picking...
congress
is
picking
up
precisely
the
words
in
the
computer
inquiries...
"of
transmission
capacity
for
the
movement
of
information;
whereas,
enhanced
service
combines
basic
service
with
computer-processing
applications.
"
the
basic
service
remained.
and
then
the
commission
and
the
d.c.
circuit
confronted
just
the
problem
you
are.
what
happened
is
that
providers,
under
the
computer
inquiries
and
under
the
modified
final
judgement,
tried
to
combine
the
two
things
and
say,
"we're
no
longer
regulated".
they
said,
"yeah,
i
know
we
had
telecommunications,
but
now
we
want
to
add
something
onto
it.
"
and
i
can
take
you
to
what
the
courts
said
and
what
the
commission
said,
and
that
is
at
pages
24
to
25.
and
i
think
it's
exactly
what
congress
would
think
if
it
were
confronted
with
this
problem
under
the
plain
definitions.
the
second
block
quote
on
24.
this
is
when
the
commission
was
confronted
with
this
problem.
it
said
that
the
argument
that
they're
accepting
now
would
allow
circumvention
of
the
computer
ii
and
computer
iii
basic
enhanced
framework.
at&t
would
be
able
to
avoid
computer
ii
and
computer
iii,
unbundling--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
on
this
question,
the
answer
is,
no,
because
mr.
hungar
has
conceded,
and
the
commission
conceded
below,
that
congress
was
adopting
a
definitional
framework.
i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
commission
can
change
its
policy
judgement
about
how
it
wants
to
regulate
within
the
definitional
framework
that
congress
adopted.
so
you've
pointed
me
to
a
critical
point,
and
that
is
to
reinforce--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--and
that
is
to
reinforce
this.
our
position
is
that
the
computer
inquiries
and
the
at&t
mfj
had
definitions:
what's
a
basic
service?
what's
an
enhanced
service?
congress
adopted
those
for
the
purposes
of
the
definition
of
a
"telecommunications
service"
and
an
"information
service".
now,
you
can
make
policy
judgements
about
how
to
regulate,
although
you're
going
to
have
to
do
it
under
the
forbearance
regime
adopted
in
a
response
to
justice
scalia's
opinion
for
the
court
in
mci.
but,
nonetheless,
the
definitions
are
what
they
are.
this
is
a
statute
that's
being
interpreted.
so,
let
me
come
back.
so,
what
did
the
commission
say
under
those
definitions?
at&t
would
be
able
to
avoid
computer
ii
and
computer
iii
unbundling
and
tariff
requirements
for
any
basic
service
that
it
could
combine
with
an
enhanced
service.
you
know,
we've
got
the
telecommunications,
like
we're
going
to
tack
e-mail
onto
it.
this
is
obviously
an
undesirable
and
unintended
result.
the
d.c.
circuit,
faced
with
precisely
the
same
question
under
the
framework
that
congress
intended
to
adopt,
that
is
on
the
next
page,
on
page
25,
right
below
the
block
quote.
the
block
quote
sets
up
the
problem.
the
d.c.
circuit,
however,
rejected
that
conclusion,
the
one
that's
being
proposed
here
by
the
commission,
as
a
strained
interpretation
of
the
language
of
the
decree
that
could
not
have
been
intended
because
it
would
allow
the
bocs
to,
quote,
"create
an
enormous
loophole"
in
the
core
restriction
of
the
decree.
so,
justice
o'connor,
this
comes
back
to
your
point
in
the
first
half
of
the
argument,
and
that
is,
it
becomes
completely
circular.
if
the
point
is
that
you
will
only
be
subject
to
common-carrier
regulation
when
you
decide
to
provide
telecommunications
service,
nobody
ever
will.
everybody
will
always
bundle.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
agree.
there
are
five
xxx
where
the
solicitor
general,
sort
of,
pulls
the
ripcord
here.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
first,
they
have
a
chenery
problem;
and
that
is,
this
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
the
commission's
ruling.
what
they
said
in
the
commission's
ruling
is
that
they
could
take
a
title
i
information
service
and
regulate
it
as
common
carriage.
this
is
an
entirely
different
animal.
this
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
still
this
is
covered
by
chenery,
but
let's
go
to
that.
and
so,
here's
the
proposition.
the
proposition
is
that
the
commission
has
the
untethered
authority
to
force
someone
to
provide
a
telecommunications
service.
and
my
question
back
to
the
other
side
is,
where
in
the
world
in
the
statute
is
that?
there
is
no
textural
foundation
for
it
whatsoever.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
let
me
deal
with
the
premise
that
congress
threw
this
into
the
lap
of
the
fcc,
and
also
how
it
is
they
propose
to
deal
with
it,
on
that
assumption.
the
answer
is,
they
did
not
throw
it
into
the
lap
of
the
fcc.
the
'96
act
enacted
these
definitions,
which
are
very
carefully
calibrated,
for
which
there
is
no
text...
textual
support.
i
will
come
back
to
"offering".
but
congress
did
enact
a
specific
provision
in
mci
versus
at&t.
it
addressed
not
only
the
concern
of
the
majority,
but
also
the
concerns
of
the
dissenters,
that
the
commission
needed
some
flexibility.
and
it
told
the
commission
how
to
address
this
problem.
it
said,
in
the
forbearance
procedures,
"here
are
the
rules
that
you
will
apply
in
deciding
to
lift
regulation.
"
they're
quite
detailed.
they're...
now,
let
me
take
you
to
them
again...
they're
at
the
end
of
our...
i'm
sorry,
they
are
at...
in
our
appendix,
at
3a.
this
is
what
congress
said.
congress
said,
"we
recognize
the
commission
needs
some
flexibility,
but
there
are
going
to
be
rules,
and
there
are
going
to
be
rules
so
courts
can,
for
example,
review,
later
on,
whether
or
not
you're
actually
applying
what
we...
doing
what
you
want...
what
we
wanted
you
to
do.
"
and
here's
what
the
commission
has
to
do,
according
to
congress.
and
it's
what
the
commission
did
not
do
here.
i'm
going
to
start
with
the
indented
paragraphs,
1,
2,
and
3,
and
then
subparagraph
b.
it
told
the
commission
to
look
at
whether
or
not
the
former
regulation
is
not
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
charges...
and
skipping
again...
are
just
and
reasonable
and
are
not
unjustly
or
unreasonably
discriminatory.
paragraph
2,
they
have
to
make
sure
it's
not
necessary
for
the
protection
of
consumers,
that
it's
in
the
public
interest,
and
that
the
competitive
effects
will
be
positive
rather
than
negative.
the
commission
did
none
of
this,
notwithstanding
that
congress
specifically
directed
them
to.
now,
let
me
then
turn
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
"offering".
now,
in
different
contexts,
i
admit,
it's
conceivable
to
come
up
with
different
meanings
of
"offerings",
but
this
is
a
context,
and
i
think
if
you
take
any
example
where
congress
actually...
i've
given
you
the
common
carrier.
i
don't
think
the
railroad
could
ever
get
away
with
saying
it.
i
gave
you
the
examples
of
the
computer
inquiries
and
the
at&t
mfj,
which
are
on
point.
but
take
anything
that
congress
regulates.
take,
for
example,
the
fact
that
we
regulate
offering
of
cigarettes
to
children.
now,
a
merchandiser
couldn't
come
along
and
say,
"i'm
not
offering
cigarettes.
"
"what
i've
done
is,
i've
created
a
smoking
service.
"
"i've
taken
the
cigarettes,
and
i've
put
a
lighter
in
it,
and
you've
just
got
one
bill
that
you
have
to
pay
for
it.
"
the
idea
that
that
would
evade
what
congress
is
concerned
about
is
loopy.
think
about
what
congress
is
concerned
about
with
common-carriage
regulations.
there
are
three
principal
consequences
to
being
a
telecommunications
service.
and
imagine
if
any
of
them
changed
a
whit,
except
to
favor
us,
when
you
bundle
the
e-mail
with
it.
first,
nondiscrimination.
would
congress
want
you
to
have
to
charge
just
and
reasonable
rates
to
a
competitor
any
less
when
you're
selling
e-mail
with
the
telecommunications
than
the
telecommunications
alone?
no.
interconnection.
would
congress
want
a
cable
modem
service
network
to
be
less
interconnected
with
all
the
other
networks
simply
because
it
has
e-mail
or
a
web
browser
on
it?
i
don't
know
why,
i
suppose
congress
would
want
to
be
more
sure,
because
there
are
more
messages.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
a
fair
point,
and
it
is
basically...
aside
for
the,
sort
of,
nod
at
history,
it...
mr.
hungar
started
with
that.
and
our
point
is
that
congress
told
them
how
to
deregulate,
and
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
did
that,
but
with
a
critical
concession.
it
said--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
think
it's
a
very
fair
comparison.
but
also,
justice
breyer,
i
think...
you
know,
i
think
we're
all
on
the
same
page
about
what
congress
intended,
and
that
is,
first
of
all,
congress
was
aware
of
cable
modem
service.
that's
said
expressly
in
the
court's
opinion
in
gulf
power.
it
was
emphasized
by
the
cable
industry
in
gulf
power
itself.
there
is...
there
are
several
statutory
provisions
that
refer
to
cable
companies
being
common
carriage.
but,
justice
breyer,
what
they
said
is
this,
"we
have
broad
encompassing
definitions,
and
that
is,
it's
not
going
to
make
a
difference
if
you
combine
two
things
together.
"
"but,
commission,
you
go
make
those.
"
--justice
breyer,
all
the
findings
you're
talking
about
are
listed
in
the
section
10
forbearance
proceedings.
now,
imagine
the
world
as
the
commission
sees
it.
it
says
that
forbearance
applies
to
telecommunications
service.
but
when
it
comes
to
things
that
aren't
telecommunications
service,
it's
"katie
bar
the
door".
we
don't
have
any
rules.
what
kind
of
logical
regulatory
scheme
is
that?
and
that
is
that
the
commission
is
constrained
with
respect
to
its
expertise.
but
things
that
are
information
services
that
are
outside
telecommunications,
it
can
do
whatever
it
wants.
justice
breyer,
i
did
want
to
make
one
additional
point,
and
that
is,
again,
there
is
a
statutory
provision
here
that
addresses
their
claim
that
they
can
force
you
to
provide
telecommunications
service,
and
that
is
the
definition
of
a
"telecommunications
carrier".
and
it
is
on
2a.
i
read
the
exception,
so
now
i'm
dealing
with
the
second
sentence
of
the
definition,
"a
telecommunications
carrier
shall
be
treated
as
a
common
carrier
under
this
act
only
to
the
extent
that
it
is
engaged
in
providing
telecommunications
services.
"
this
lines
up
perfectly
with
this
court's
decision
in
midwest
video.
there
was
a
constraint
on
what
it...
what
regulation
you
could
impose
on
broadcasters.
this
one
says,
"you
are
only
going
to
be
a
common
carrier
if
you're
providing
a
telecommunications
service.
"
but
the
fcc
has
this
vision
that
it
can,
sort
of,
solve
all
the
problems
through
its
raw
discretion
and
to
force
someone
to
provide
common
carriage.
but
the
statute's
very
clear,
if
you
are
not
providing
a
telecommunications
service,
you
are
not
going
to
be
a
telecommunications
carrier;
and,
therefore,
you
are
not
going
to
be
providing
common
carriage.
and,
as
i've
said,
i
don't
understand
how
it
is,
even
if
one
looked
at
this
particular
context,
you
could
decide
that
congress
thought
the
bundle
made
regulation
less
regulated...
less
necessary,
rather
than
more
regulated...
more
necessary.
i
want,
next,
if
i
could,
to
talk
about
the
notion
that
you
can
self-deregulate,
and
how
utterly
implausible
this
is,
how
is
it
that
the
commission
could
imagine
that
congress
created
the
following
regime.
and
that
is,
if
you
want
to
provide
common
carriage,
you'll
be
subject
to
this
regulation;
but
if
you
don't
feel
like
it,
well,
that's
okay.
that
will
render
the
definition
of
"telecommunications
service"...
if
you
just
want
to
tack
e-mail
onto
the
thing,
that
will
render
the
definition
of
"telecommunications
service"...
in
the
internet,
you're
a
dead
letter,
because
who
in
the
world
would
ever
do
it?
if
it's
up
to
the
regulated
entity,
why
in
the
world
would
anyone
provide
common
carriage?
i
think
this
has,
actually,
a
remarkable
parallel
to
the
court's
decision
in
the
oneida
indian
nation
case,
where
the
court
rejected
the
suggestion
that
what
you
could
do
is...
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
indians
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
would
be
able
to
get
property
back.
this
is
what
the
court
said,
"if
oin
may
unilaterally
reassert
sovereign
control
and
remove
those
parcels
from
the
local
tax
rolls,
little
would
prevent
the
tribe
from
initiating
a
new
generation
of
litigation
to
free
the
parcels.
"
--remember,
they're
free
from
all
regulation
at
all...
"free
the
parcels
from
land
zone...
local
zoning
or
other
regulatory
controls
that
protect
all
landowners
in
the
area.
"
and
then,
justice
ginsburg,
the
opinion
goes
on
to
talk
about
section
465,
which
is
exactly
like
section
10
forbearance,
"recognizing
these
practical
concerns,
congress
has
provided
a
mechanism
for
the
acquisition
of
the
lands.
"
"the
regulations
implementing
section
465
are
sensitive
to
the
complex
interjurisdictional
concerns
that
arise
when
the
tribe
seeks
to
retain...
regain
sovereign
control
over
territory.
"
"the
secretary
must
consider.
"
--and
it
lists
a
whole
series
of
things.
and
the
parallel,
i
think,
is
exact.
you
can't
have
congress
enacting
a
scheme
that
tells
you
how
to
do
it.
now,
let
me
return
to,
then,
mr.
cappuccio's
suggestion,
justice
scalia,
that
this
is
an
ingredient,
it's
not
a
product.
the
straightforward
answer
is,
there's
no
mention
of
ingredients
or
products
in
the
statute.
it
says
"telecommunications
service".
and
the
question
under
the
definition
of
"telecommunications
service"
is,
are
you
providing
telecommunications?
yeah,
the
information's
going
back
and
forth.
is
it
to
the
public?
sure,
anybody
can
buy
it.
is
there
a
fee?
you
bet,
it's
kind
of
expensive,
actually.
and
that's
all
that
congress
cared
about.
now,
this
is
not
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
butter
in
a
cake,
because
you...
it...
there
are
two
reasons.
the
first
is,
fundamentally,
the
telecommunications
is
the
same;
it
hasn't
been
"cooked"
into
something
else.
and
the
second--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--right.
the
second
is,
the
reason
all
those
hypotheticals
are...
wheels
and
cars
and
those
sorts
of
things...
don't
make
any
sense
here
is
that
they
assume
a
few
things.
the
first
is,
they're
assuming
a
first
sale
that
gets
regulated.
somebody
buys
the
butter,
somebody
buys
the
tires
and
gets
regulated.
but
under
their
rules
it's
never
regulated
at
all.
the
telecommunications
just,
poof,
escapes
all
regulation.
and
the
second
is
that,
in
the
car
example,
it's
because
there's...
the
reason
it
has
intuitive
appeal
is
that
there's
a
regulatory
scheme
about
cars.
so
congress
has
decided
how
all
the
inputs
will
be
regulated
together.
but,
again,
remember
the
consequence
of
sticking
this
into
the
unregulated
"information
services"
box
is,
it's
all
gone.
there's
no
regulation
of
it
whatsoever.
it's
just
not
a
scheme
that
makes
any
sense.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
