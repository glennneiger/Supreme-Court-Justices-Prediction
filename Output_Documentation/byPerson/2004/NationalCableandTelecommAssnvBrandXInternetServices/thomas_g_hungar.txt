mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
telecommunications
act
of
1996,
congress
declared
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
preserve
the
vibrant
and
competitive
free
market
that
presently
exists
for
the
internet
unfettered
by
federal
or
state
regulation.
the
fcc
implemented
that
clear
policy
directive
in
the
order
under
review
by
concluding
that
cable
modem
service
should
be
classified
as
an
information
service
and
not
a
telecommunications
service
under
the
communications
act.
that
reasonable
determination
should
be
upheld,
because
it
is
consistent
with
the
text,
history,
and
purposes
of
the
act.
the
act
defines
"telecommunications"
as
the
transmission
of
information
without
change
in
form
or
substance,
and
"telecommunications
service"
as
the
offering
of
telecommunications
directly
to
the
public
for
a
fee.
given
that
focus
on
the
nature
of
the
fcc
reasonably
concluded
that
the
integrated
cable
modem
service
offering
should
be
viewed
as
a
whole
in
determining
its
classification
under
the
act.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
don't
think
we
would
say,
in
that
example,
that
you
are
offering
windshields,
per
se.
i
mean,
to
give
an
example,
[carmaxdotcom]
offers
cars
for
sale
over
the
internet,
but
i
don't
think
we
would
ordinarily
say
that
they
are
offering
windshields
or
steering
wheels
or
tires
for
sale.
certainly,
that's
not
been
necessary
construction
of
a
regulatory
regime
that,
say,
is
designed
to
focus
on
sellers
of
tires.
it
wouldn't
automatically,
as
a
matter
of
law,
have
to
be
applied
to
entities
that
are
selling
cars
instead.
and
the
same
is
true
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
again,
i--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
regulatory--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--regime.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
the...
and,
by
the
same
token,
the
transmission
component
is
useless
unless
it
offers
all
of
the...
all
of
the
information-services
type
functionality
that
internet
service
offers.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but,
your
honor,
it's
the...
it's
the
capabilities
that
you
purchase
in
the
integrated
package...
not
the
pure
transmission,
but
the
other
capabilities,
the
computer
data-processing,
data-access
capabilities
that
are
an
essential
part
of
that.
if
all
you
had
was
the
transmission,
with
none
of
the
other
computer
functionality...
if
you
typed
in
the
supreme
court's
website,
for
instance,
[supremecourtusdotgov,]
nothing
would
happen,
because
all
of
the
computer
functionality,
like
the
domain-name
system,
which
is
a
very
sophisticated,
complex,
distributed
database
involving
literally
millions
of
computers
around
the
world,
that's
data
processing.
that's
information-services
capability
that
you
use
every
time
you
type
in
a
website.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it's
not
just
transmission.
it's
much
more
than
that.
and
without
the...
without
the
computer
data-processing
aspects,
it
doesn't
do
anything.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
two
points.
your
question
starts
with,
i
think,
an
incorrect
assumption
about
the
nature
of
the
world.
the
pure
transmission
function
has
not
been
offered
to
the
public,
to
consumers,
separately
and
apart...
again,
it
doesn't
do
anything.
consumers
don't
use
the
pure
transmission
functions
by
itself.
"internet
service",
by
definition,
includes
the
data-processing
aspects
that
the
commission
so
found
on
this
record,
and
that
factual
determine
is
reasonable
and
supported
by
the
record.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
in
the...
in
the
hypothetical,
it's
conceivable
that
a
different
result
might
be
reached
by
the
regulatory
agency
with
authority
for
construing
the
statute
and
applying
it
to
particular
fact
situations.
but
i
don't
think
the
word
"offering"
necessarily
and
always
compels
the
conclusion
that
any
component
of
an
integrated
offering
is
also
separately
being
offered
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
it
depends
on
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
as
construed
by
the
regulatory
agency.
"offering"
is
ambiguous.
and,
therefore,
what
the
agency
has
done
here
is
reasonable.
and
it's
supported,
i
would
add,
by
the
consistent
pre-1996
regulatory
approach
in
this
area,
which
all
parties
agreed
congress
incorporated
into
the
1996
act.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
because
the
telephone
companies
have
always
offered
a
standalone
transmission
component
which
other...
which
other
isps
can
utilize.
they've
done
that
because
of
the
preexisting
regulatory
regime.
they've
always
made
the
separate
offering;
therefore,
it
is
a
telecommunications
service.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
it's
certainly
not
unusual
for
this
court,
in
construing
a
statute,
to
look
to
the
regulatory
history
that
led
up
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
particularly
where
it's
clear
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
was
in...
was
essentially
borrowing
from
the
pre-1996
regulatory
definitions,
the
definitional
scheme
that
the
commission
adopted
in
1980
in
its
computer
ii
report.
all
parties
agree
that
that
definitional
framework
forms
the
foundation
for
the
very
definitions
at
issue
here.
that's
undisputed.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
the
fcc
has
tentatively
concluded
that
when
a
telephone
company
makes
an
integrated
offering
of
the
dsl
transmission
capacity
with
the
internet
service,
as
a
combined
offering
to
consumers,
that,
tentatively
that
is
an
information
service,
precisely
the
classification
that
you--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--read
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct.
and
even
though...
when
a
telephone
company
is
making
a
separate
standalone
offering
of
just
the
pure
dsl
transmission
capacity,
which
is
useful
only
to
isps,
to
internet
service
providers,
not
to
consumers,
that
that
would
be
viewed,
has
traditionally
been
viewed,
as
a
common-carriage
offering,
because
it's
pure
transmission.
but
when
it's
a
bundled...
or
when
it's
an
integrated
offering...
again,
this
goes
back
to
1980.
this
very
issue,
justice
scalia,
was
addressed
by
the
commission
in
1980,
and
it
said,
if
the
offering
is
limited
to
pure
transmission,
it
is
basic
telecommunications,
basic
service,
the
precursor
to
telecommunications
service;
but
if
you
add
any
computer
functionality
to
the
offering,
then
it
is
not
basic,
it
is
enhanced
service.
they
said
that
at
paragraphs
93
to
97
of
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--computer
ii
order.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
offering.
if
the
entity
is
offering...
if
cable
companies,
tomorrow,
start
offering
pure
cable
transmission
on
an...
on
a
nondiscriminate
basis,
that
would
regulated
as
a
telecommunications
service.
but
what
the
commission
has
always
said
is
that
you
look
at
the
offering
as
a
whole,
and
if
it's
a...
an
integrated
offering
that
encompasses
not
just
telecommunications,
but
data-processing,
and
computer-type
services,
as
well,
it's
in
the
enhanced
or
information-service
category
that...
the
commission
said,
in
1980,
"we're
doing
this,
in
part,
because
it's
not
clear...
it's
clear
that
congress
didn't
intend,
in
the
1934
act,
to
extend
regulation
to
this
new...
this
novel,
new
type
of
intermingled
service,
and
it
would
be
inappropriate,
we
think,
to
try
and
extend
the
act
to
that,
for
a
number
of
reasons,
including
that
it's
very
hard
to
draw
lines
between
which
is...
which
has
more
of
a
communications
versus
data-processing
component.
"
"they
had
tried
that,
and
concluded
that
it
was
unworkable.
"
and
so,
they
drew
the
line.
basic
transmission,
pure
transmission,
if
the
offering
is
limited
to
that,
it
is
on
the
telecommunications
service,
or
basic-service
line;
if
it
contains
the
computer-processing
capabilities,
data
acquisition
and
retrival
and
the
like--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
it's
only...
it
only...
it's
only
question-begging
because
the
respondents
have
attempted
to
mischaracterize
or
misdescribe
what
is
going
on
here.
the
rule
is,
if
you
are
a
common
carrier,
as
the
telephone
companies
are,
and,
in
1980,
the
fcc
was
regulating
in
an
environment
when
there
was
only
one
avenue
into
the
home,
one
communications
avenue,
the
telephone
line,
and
they
said,
"under
these
circumstances,
telephone
common
carriers
are
not
going
to
be
allowed
to
escape
title
ii
regulation
completely
by
offering
enhanced
services,
if
they
can
offer
an
enhanced
service,
an
intermingled...
integrated
transmission
and
computer
data-processing
service,
and
that
service,
as
a
whole,
when
it's
offered,
will
be
unregulated,
because
title
ii
does
not
extend
to
those
types
of
integrated
service
offerings.
"
they
said,
"however,
if
you...
if
it
is
a
telephone
common
carrier
that's
making
that
offering,
a
facilities-based,
typically-monopoly
common
carrier,
they
will
have
an
obligation
to
also
make
a
standalone
offering
of
transmission
under
title
ii,
because
they
were
telephone...
traditional
common
carriers.
"
cable
companies
are
not
in
that
category.
they
have
not
traditionally
been--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
actually,
that's
an
important
point,
justice
ginsburg.
the
fcc
has
never
said
that
an
integrated
offering
of
dsl
that...
dsl
internet
service,
the
combined
integrated
offering,
the
analog
to
what
we
have
here,
in
the
cable
context...
the
fcc
has
never
said
that
that
is
not
an
information
service.
they
have...
and
they
have
tentatively
concluded
now
that
it
is.
what
they
have
said...
what
they
said
in
the
1998
order
that
respondents
cite
was
that
the
telecommunications...
the
telephone
companies
are
already
offering
dsl
on
a
standalone,
pure-transmission
basis
to
other
competing
internet
service
providers;
therefore,
it
is
a
telecommunications
service.
indeed,
it
was
undisputed
that
it
was
a
telecommunications
service.
and,
again,
the
reason
they
were
doing
that,
we
assume,
is
because
the
preexisting
computer
ii
and
computer
iii
framework
required
the
telephone
carriers
to
make
that
standalone
offering.
but
the
commission
has
not
said
the
integrated
offering
is
also
a
telecommunications
service,
and
it
has
now
tentatively
concluded
that
it
is
an
information
service,
in
keeping
with
25
years
of
regulatory
history
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
any
standalone,
pure-transmission
offering,
including,
under
the
computer
ii
rationale,
to
the
extent
the
commission
adheres
to
it--
and
it
hasn't
overturned
it
yet;
it's
considering
the
extent
to
which
it
should
create
an
exception
in
the
dsl
context...
but
under
computer
ii,
a
basic,
traditional
common
carrier
cannot
get
away...
cannot
get
out
of
title
ii
regulation
by
offering
an
integrated
offering.
they
will
also
have
to
make
the
standalone
offering,
unless
and
to
the
extent
the
commission
determines
that
that's
not
necessary;
for
instance,
because
the
enhanced
or
integrated...
information-service
market
is
sufficiently
competitive
that
it's
not
necessary
and
there
are
adequate
alternative--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--communications
pipelines.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
but--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--let
me
try
to
clarify
what
the
commission's
position
is.
the
commission
has
never
said,
that
i
am
aware
of
or
that
respondents
have
pointed
out,
that
the
integrated...
bundled,
if
you
will...
the
integrated
offering
of
transmission
plus
internet
service
functionality
is
a
telecommunications
service.
they
have
never
said
that.
they
have
said
that
some
companies,
telephone
common
carriers,
will
be
required
to
make
the
separate
offering,
but
it
is
not
correct
that
the
integrated
offering
is,
itself,
going
to
be
classified
as
a
telecommunications
service.
it's
classified--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--as
information.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
you
could.
and,
in
fact,
the
commission
is...
has
issued
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
and
an
invitation
for
comment
in
the
order
under
review
here
to
consider
whether
it
should
make
such
a
requirement
under
its
ancillary
title
i
authority
in
this
context,
and
what...
and,
if
so,
to
what
extent?
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
history
and,
not
unrelated
to
that,
the
fact
that
the
cable
companies
have
not
traditionally
been
regulated
as
common
carriers
under
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--title
ii
of
the
act.
yes,
that's
correct.
and
then
just
one
final
point,
if
i
may...
justice
scalia,
i
think
this
also
goes
to
your
question...
respondents
are
the
ones
who
are
being
inconsistent,
and
that...
the
states,
for
instance,
they
suggest
that,
"well,
if"...
they
say
that,
"well,
cable
modem
service
should
be
regulated
as
a
telecommunications
service,
in
part.
"
but,
of
course,
traditional
information
service
providers,
isps,
should
not
be;
they're
pure
information
service,
even
though
isps
also
provide
transmission.
they
provide
telecommunications.
information
service...
excuse
me...
internet
service
does
not
work
unless
you
have
transmission
from
wherever
the
telephone
call
goes
into
the
central
office,
and
it
has
to
be
transmitted
from
there
to
the
internet
service
provider's
point
of
presence
on
the
internet,
and
from
there
out
onto
the
internet.
and
internet
service
providers
either
own
or
lease
that
transmission
capacity
and
offer
that
as
part
of
the
bundled
offering
that
they
make.
so
every
internet
service
provider
would
be
a
telecommunications
carrier
under
their
position,
and
that
is
contrary
to
what
the
fcc
said
before
the
'96
act,
and
it's
contrary
to
what
congress
said
in
the
1996
act.
they
said--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
turning
first
to
the
question
of
the
regulatory
history,
respondents
continue
to
rely
on
the
fact
that,
under
computer
ii,
the
fcc
required
telephone
common
carriers
to
separate
out
and
separately
offer
the
basic
transmission
component.
but,
importantly,
and
what
refutes
respondent's
attempts
to
rely
on
history,
congress
did
not...
excuse
me...
the
fcc
did
not
impose
that
requirement
on
enhanced
service
providers.
there
were
entities
called
"value-added
networks"
that
obtained
the
telecommunications
functionality,
bundled
it
together
with
information
servicing
protocol
conversion-type
computer
functions,
and
offered
that
bundled
service
as
an
enhanced
service.
and
the
commission
said,
in
computer
ii,
"that
is
an
unregulated
enhanced-service
offering,
it
is
not
subject
to
title
ii
of
the
act,
because
we
don't
think
congress
intended
title
ii,
which
is
aimed
at
traditional
telephone
communications,
to
deal
with
this
new
form
of
intermingled
integrated
service.
"
it
is
not
regulated,
even
though
it
is
true
that
there
was
a
communications
component.
and,
under
respondent's
rationale,
that
offer
or
that
value-added
network
should
have
been
required
to
make
it
file
a
tariff
and
comply
with
all
the
regulations
of
title
ii
of
the
act.
and
footnote
5
of
our
reply
brief
cites
the
orders
discussing
this
fact.
and
in
addition,
under
computer
ii,
the
commission
required
at&t
and,
later,
the
regional
bell
operating
companies,
if
they
were
going
to
offer
enhanced
services,
to
offer
them
separately
through
subsidiaries,
unregulated
subsidiaries,
even
though
they
were
offering
bundles
of
enhanced
service
and
telecommunications,
the
telecommunications,
which
they
obtained
under
tariff
from
their
parent
corporation.
but
the
entire
bundled
offering
was
unregulated.
and
that's
been
true
for
25
years.
and,
again,
congress,
in
1996,
gave
no
indication
that
it
was
overturning
this
well-established
situation
in
which
enhanced
services,
now
information
services,
were
not
regulated.
and
to
suggest
that
congress,
in
an
act
that
talks
about
preserving
the
hands-off
approach
to
the
internet,
in
fact,
regulated
all
internet
service
providers
in
a
way
that
they
had
never
been
regulated
before,
we
submit,
is
certainly
an
unlikely
interpretation
of
the
act,
and
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
fcc
was
reasonable
in
rejecting
that
position.
justice
breyer,
you
asked
about
voicemail
or
similar
type
systems
that
would
preserve
a
message.
if
provided
by
a
computer
functionality,
that
service
is
an
information
service.
voicemail
is
an
information
service.
but
the
fcc
has
at
least
suggested
that
voicemail
and
basic
telecommunications...
if
a
telephone
company
tried
to
offer
it...
say,
"we're
going
to
offer
this
bundled,
and
we
don't
think
it's
regulated.
"
telephone
companies
try
that
sort
of
thing
from
time
to
time,
and
then
the
fcc
is
faced
with
a
decision,
in
its
discretion,
of
whether
that
should
be
viewed
as
an
integrated
offering
or,
instead,
as
really
two
things
that
have
just
been
added
together
but
aren't
really...
that
are
really
two
distinct
services.
and
the
fcc
has
suggested,
in
that
context,
that
telephone
service
and
voicemail
service,
even
if
they're
bundled
together,
are
two
distinct
services.
and
there's
an
important
difference,
i
think,
between
that
type
of
offering
and
the
one
here.
you
can
use
your...
even
if
your
telephone
company
offers
you
voicemail,
obviously,
you...
a
lot
of
your
use
of
the
telephone
system
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
voicemail;
it's
pure
telephony,
pure
telecommunications;
whereas,
with
cable
modem
service,
every
time
you
use
it,
essentially,
you
are
utilizing
at
least
some
of
the
data-processing,
computer-enhanced
functionality
that
is
being
provided
by
your...
by
your
internet
service
provider...
the
domain-name
system,
as
we
discussed,
caching.
for
instance,
mr.
goldstein
says
he
goes
to
[supremecourtusdotgov]
every
morning.
i
suspect
he
doesn't
actually
go
to
this
court's
computer.
he
probably
gets
at
least
the
first
page
off
of
the
cache,
which
provided
by
the
isp.
