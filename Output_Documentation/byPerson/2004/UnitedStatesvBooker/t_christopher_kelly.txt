mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
years
of
freddie
booker's
sentence
punished
him
for
crimes
that
were
proved
to
a
jury.
but
the
judge
added
another
eight
years
to
his
sentence,
years
that
were
only
authorized
by
the
judge's
finding
that
fred
booker
probably
committed
other
crimes.
like
thousands
of
other
federal
defendants,
booker's
sentence
was
increased
based
on
crimes
that
were
never
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
final
years
of
a
federal
sentence
are
as
worthy
of
constitutional
protections
against
undeserved
punishment
as
are
the
first
years.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
under
the
guidelines
or
under
the--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--no,
that
is
not
unconstitutional.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
believe
it
would
be,
justice
breyer.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
right.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
parole
commissions
don't
increase
sentences.
parole
commissions
decrease
sentences.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
right.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
yes.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
that
is
constitutional,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--as
i--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--other
than
venues--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--no,
not
at
all.
and
as
i--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--well,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
second
hypothetical,
your
honor.
but
my
understanding
of
the
hypothetical
was
that
if
the
judge
gave
five
years
and
the
appellate
court
said,
"no,
you
should
have
given
seven
years
because
of
the
existence
of
a
certain
fact--
"
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
"you
must...
you
must
increase
the
sentence....
"
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
the
relevant
constitutional
principle
doesn't
have
to
do
with
whether
it's
the
executive
branch
of
government
or
the
judicial
branch
of
government;
it
has
to
do
whether
a
fact
is
necessary
in
order
to
increase
a
sentence.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
no.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
in
your
hypotheticals,
justice
breyer,
as
i
understand
them,
each
of
those
entities
is
decreasing
a
sentence.
we're
talking
about
a
sentencing
commission
that
authorizes
a
court
and,
in
fact...
well,
authorizes
a
court
to
increase
a
sentence
after
finding
a
particular
fact,
and
that
is
what
triggers
the
sixth
amendment
protection.
it's
the
fact
that
a
judge
is
authorized
to
give
a
longer
sentence
because
of
the
existence
of
a
fact
than
he
would
otherwise
be
authorized
to
impose.
and
that
is
the
essential
protection
against
which
the
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right
protects.
that
is
a
fact
that
has
to
be
found
by
a
jury,
not
by
a
judge.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
problem
with
that
system,
your
honor.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
blakely
answers
that
question.
blakely
distinguishes
between
a
discretionary
system
in
which
the
judge
has
the
authority
to
consider
a
number
of
different
factors
in
order
to
do
what
the
judge
thinks
is
fair,
but
is
not
required
to--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--give
any
particular
weight--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--the
policy
is
that
if
the
judge's
sentencing
authority
increases
by
finding
of
fact,
which
is
not
the
case
in
a
discretionary
system.
that
fact
is
the
kind
of
finding
that
we
leave
to
a
jury,
because
juries--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--i
don't
think
it's
contrary
to
our
system,
your
honor,
to
say
that
if
a
more
serious
sentence
attaches
to
a
more
serious
crime,
or
to
a
more
serious
version
of
a
crime,
then
it's
up
to
the
jury
to
decide
whether
the
more
serious
crime
or
more
serious
version
was
committed.
in
fact,
that
is
essential
to
our
system.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
yes,
it
would,
because,
again,
under
a
discretionary
system,
the
judge's
sentencing
authority
is
unaffected
by
the
finding
of
a
fact.
if
the
parole
commission
determines
that
one
offender's
sentence
should
be
increased
and
the
other
offender's
should
not
be
decreased,
that
has
no
sixth
amendment
application
or
sixth
amendment--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--thank
you.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
remember.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
no,
no,
again,
i'm
not--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--well,
maybe
i...
maybe
i
don't
understand
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
because
parole
commissions
do
not
increase
sentences;
parole
commissions
decrease
sentences.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
okay.
[laughter]
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
yes.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
it
would
certainly
be
unconstitutional
for
a
parole
commission
to
find
a
fact
that
increased
a
sentence.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
yes.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
if
it
could
find
a
fact
that
increased
the
sentence,
yes,
because
those
facts
must
be
found
by
a
jury.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
sure.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
if
the
agency
were
increasing
an
authorized
sentence--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--on
the
basis
of
a
finding--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--right.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
after
the...
instead
of
the
judge
or
after
the
judge?
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
if
there
were
facts
which
were
necessary
to
authorize--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--right,
that's
fine.
if
it's
within
the
range
authorized
by
the
jury's
verdict,
it's
fine.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
assuming
that
authority
is
given
to
the
parole
commission
to
select
a
sentence,
and
no
further
findings
need
to
be
made
beyond
those
made
by
the
jury,
there's
no
sixth
amendment
problem
with
that.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
in
fact,
there
might
be
a
lot
of
other
constitutional
problems,
but
not
a
sixth
amendment
problem.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
yes.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
for
a
couple
of
reasons,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
is
that
congress
certainly
didn't
intend
to
have
dual
systems.
that
destroys
the
congressional
purpose
of
uniformity
because
you
would
have
sentences,
i
suppose,
being
uniform
under
systems...
the
system
where
guidelines
applied,
but
certainly
not
under
the
system
where
the
guidelines
don't
apply,
because
there
are
guideline
facts
that
need
to
be
found.
so
that
congressional
purpose
is
not
advanced.
the
second
problem
is
that
it's
such
an
easily
manipulable
system,
particularly
by
the
government.
if
the
government
wants
to
be
in
the
guidelines,
it
doesn't
allege
a
sentence-enhancing
fact,
or
a
guideline
fact.
if
the
government
doesn't
want
to
be
bound
by
the
guidelines,
it
alleges
a
guideline
fact,
and
that
takes
sentencing
out
of
the
guidelines.
and
that
cannot
be
what
congress
intended.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
our--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--well,
i
think
our
proposal
doesn't
really
allow
for
any
manipulation
at
all,
justice
souter.
we're
simply
saying
that
the
fact
finder
must
be
a
jury
instead
of
a
judge.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
well,
that's
certainly
true,
and
that
exists
under
the
guidelines.
it
exists
without
the
guidelines.
it
exists
in
discretionary
systems.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
think
it
does,
because--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--well,
certainly,
to
the
extent
that
prosecutors
make
decisions
about
what
charges
they're
going
to
bring--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--right.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
it
has,
to
a
large
extent.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
the
judge
is
not
required
to--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--accept
the
facts.
the
judge
typically
does.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
guess...
i
wouldn't
view
that
as
a
two-track
system,
because
the
guidelines
would
continue
to
apply
in
either
case.
it
would
not
be
a
situation
in
which
the
guidelines
apply
to
some
criminal
sentencings,
but
don't
apply
to
other
criminal
sentencings.
the
guidelines
will
apply
in
every
criminal
sentencing.
whether
a
fact
finder
needs
to
be
a
judge
or
a
jury
depends
upon
whether
the
fact
to
be
found
increases
the
judge's
sentencing
authority.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
that's
exactly
right,
justice
stevens.
you--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--i
agree
that
perjury
is
not
something
that
could
be
submitted
to
a
jury...
perjury
during
trial
is
not
something
that
could
be
submitted
to
a
jury.
that's--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--that
would
be
out.
that's
one
of
the
very
few.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
it
would
have
to
be
prosecuted
as
a
separate
crime.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens,
because
the
judge
is
still
making
the
finding
that
the
witness
deliberately
lied,
as
opposed
to
being
mistaken
in
his
testimony.
and
that
is
a
finding
of
fact
that
increases
sentencing
authority.
so
i
don't
think
that
a
jury
returning
a
guilty
verdict
in
every
case
means
that
the
jury
disbelieved,
or
thought
at
least,
that
the
defendant
was
lying.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
sure.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
and
that
still
happens,
even
under
our
proposal,
to
a
large
extent,
your
honor,
because
the
presentence
report
has
historically
guided
a
judge
in
exercising
his
discretion
at
sentencing.
to
the
extent
that
the
judge
exercises
discretion
in
selecting
a
sentence
within
a
guideline
range,
the
judge
will
still
rely
upon
the
presentence
report.
and,
frankly,
most
of
what's
in
a
presentence
report
doesn't
have
to
do
with
finding
extra
facts;
it
has
to
do
with
guiding
discretion
in
selecting
a
sentence.
so
i
don't
think
that
that
really
changes
under
our
system.
with
regard
to
the
complexity,
it's
been
my
experience
in
defending
federal
criminal
cases
that
although
the
guidelines
are
lengthy,
there
are
only
two
or
three
that
are
likely
to
apply
in
any
particular
case,
and
it's
not
particularly
complex
to
figure
out
what
those
are,
and
it
wouldn't
be
all
that
complex
to
charge
a
jury
with
regard
to
how
to
determine
facts
that
are
required
by
the
guidelines.
we
give
juries
jury
instructions
that
are
complicated
all
the
time.
we
do
it
in
rico--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--the
real
conduct
can
still
be
proved
to
a
jury,
as
long
as
it's
charged
and
proved
to
a
jury.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
there
may
be,
depending
on
the
case.
there
may
be
cases
in
which
a
general
verdict
is
adequate
because
there
are
no
guideline
facts
to
find
that
would
increase
sentencing--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--just
as
special
verdicts
have
been
used
since
apprendi
to
find
drug
quantities
and
other
facts
that
increase
maximum
sentences.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
your
honor,
i
think
we
can
trust
district
judges
to
fashion
procedural
protections
that
assure
that
trials
are
fair.
that
might,
in
some
cases,
mean
bifurcating
the
underlying
elements
of
the
offense
and
the
determination
of
those
elements
from
the
finding
of
guideline
facts--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--in
some
cases,
yes.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
well,
in
some
of
those
cases,
your
honor,
the
additional
facts
would
come
in
on
the
main
trail
anyway,
as
404(b)
kind
of
evidence
that
is
relevant
to
proving
the
underlying
charges.
and
if
it's
going
to
come
in
anyway,
then
there
probably
wouldn't
be
a
second
part
of
the
trial.
so
i
think--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--it's
certainly
possible
that
they'll
demand
separate,
or
bifurcation--
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
--well,
i've
had
experience
with
that.
and
my
experience
has
been,
as
i've
said
before,
i
might
ask
for
a
bifurcated
trial,
but
if
the
judge
thinks
that
that
evidence
is
going
to
come
in
against
my
client
anyway,
the
judge
is
going
to
deny
bifurcation.
if
the
judge
says
you're
right,
this
would
be
prejudicial
to
introduce
this
evidence
in
the
main
case,
then
we'll
bifurcate
the
trial,
and
we'll
let
the
jury
find
guilt,
guilty
not
guilty
and
then
find
sentencing
facts
if
the
guilty
verdict
is
returned.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
i
don't
know
if
they
bifurcate
all
their
trials.
my
understanding
is
that
it
works
in
a
way
that's
similar
to
what
i'm
suggesting
could
happen
in
federal
court.
mr.
t.
christopher
kelly
your
honor,
here's
how
plea
bargaining
works
now.
the
prosecutor
charges
the
easiest
crime
to
prove
that
he
can
prove.
there
is
no
effective
plea
bargaining
in
most
of
those
cases
because
the
prosecutor
knows
he's
going
to
win
that
trial.
so
the
defendant
pleads
guilty
because
he
doesn't
want
to
lose
his,
his
reduction
for
acceptance
of
responsibility.
i
think
what
changes
is
probably
if
our
proposal
is
accepted,
that
there
is
more
meaningful
negotiation
and
that
prosecutors
and
defense
attorney's
will
come
to
an
understand
in
most
cases
of
what
sentencing
facts
are
provable,
and
what
are
not,
and
cases
will
continue
to
plead
out
much
the
same
as
they
do
right
now,
except
more
effectively
because
we
eliminate
the
problem
of
the
prosecutor
being
able
to
prove
the
easiest
charge
and
save
the
heart
of
the
case
for
sentencing.
i
think
with
that,
your
honor,
i
will,
unless
there
are
other
questions,
defer
to
my
colleague.
