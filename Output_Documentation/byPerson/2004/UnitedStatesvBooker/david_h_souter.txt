what
is
the
difference
in
effect?
i
mean,
that's
where
i'm
having
trouble,
and
i
guess
others
are
having
trouble.
yes,
there's
a
difference
in
process,
there
may
be
a
difference,
in
some
sense,
in
ultimate
status,
but
there
isn't,
it
seems
to
me,
any
difference
in
effect.
the
defendant
in
the
courtroom
is
going
to
suffer
the
same
effect
either
necessitated
or
sufficed
by
this
fact
which
is
just
as
crucial,
whether
it's
a
rule,
whether
it's
a
guideline,
whether
it's
a
statute,
why
should
that
make
any
difference
for
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
practical
effect
is
the
same
but
in
the
moment
before
either
in
theory
they
commit
the
crime
or
in
the
moment
before
the
trial
is
over
or
in
the
moment
before
the
sentence
comes
down,
there
is
one
big
difference
in
the
two
classes
of
cases.
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
claim
that
he
can
not
be
sentenced
to
the
higher
range
unless
a
fact
is
found.
in
a
case
of
discretionary
sentencing
range,
within
that
range,
he
can
not
make
that
claim,
he
can
not
make
that
assumption,
and
the...
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
point
at
which
the
jury
trial
right
has
got
to
focus.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
principal
reason
you
can't,
or
i
think
the
principle
reason
that
you're
advancing
is,
that
the
guideline
system
is
so
complicated.
there
are
a
myriad
of
factors.
as
justice
scalia
says,
why
isn't
each
one
in
that
myriad
subject
to
the
same
claim?
surely,
the
argument
can't
be
just
because
it's
more
complicated,
that
the
sixth
amendment
evaporates.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is,
what
is
the
lawmaking
part?
i
mean,
if
i
have
a
choice...
if
i
have...
let's
put
the
question
this
way.
congress
has
authorized
the
commission
and
the
commission
has
said,
"if
fact
x
is
found,
then
the
range
is
higher.
"
is
there
a
lot
of
lawmaking
in
concluding
that
congress
and
the
commission
would
prefer
that
range
to
be
higher
regardless
of
whether
a
jury
found
the
fact
or
a
judge
found
the
fact?
that
doesn't
seem
like
much
of
a
stretch
to
me.
there
may
be
other
reasons
not
to
do
it.
but
in
terms
of
judicial
lawmaking,
it
doesn't
seem
like
much
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
they've
got
to
be
separately
prosecuted.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
which
you
could.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no.
i
just,
we
ought
to
have
an
obstruction
of
justice
crime
with
defined
elements
that
can
be
prosecuted.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i,
i
would,
i
would
take
the
same
position
today,
unless
you
were
going
to
define
it,
in
terms
of
a
condition
that
is
both
necessary
and
sufficient
to
expand
the
sentencing
range
of
the
crime
that
you
are
nominally
prosecuting
the
person
for.
i
mean,
that's
the
rub.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
go--
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
any
less
uniform,
any
more
manipulable,
than
on
your
proposal?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
uniformity
is
gone.
a
certain
manipulability
has
got
to
be
faced
as
a
fact,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
you're
proposing
a
better
solution,
i
gather.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
the
manipulation,
at
that
point,
is
the
manipulation,
in
a
way,
in
the
present
system,
and
that
is
it's
the
manipulability
of
charge
bargaining.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
it...
isn't
it...
isn't
that
going
to
be
so
in
every
relevant
conduct
case
in
which
the
government
thinks
the
relevant
conduct
is
a
serious
factor?
it
is
either
going
to
have
to
be
a
separate
jury
verdict
on
sentencing,
or
the
district
judge
is
going
to
be
limited
simply
to
whatever
range
the
jury
fact
finding
provides
as
the
maximum
range.
there
are
no
other
possibilities,
are
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
defendant
in
that
case
going
to
say
look,
i,
i'm
claiming
a
serious
problem,
if
you're
asking
the
jury
to
make
a
specific
finding
that
i
committed
relevant
facts
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e,
even
though
i
don't
happen
to
have
been
subjected
to
a
criminal
guilty
verdict
with
respect
to
each
one.
by,
by
requiring
those
findings,
you're
going
to
skew
the
jury's
mind
to
the
point
where
i'm
not
going
to
get
a
fair
shake
on
the
guilty/not
guilty
finding
or
special
fact
finding
most
immediately
relevant
to
this
case.
every
defendant
is
going
to
demand
a
separate
jury
proceeding
for
that,
isn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
wouldn't
sit
back
and
allow
that
focus,
if
you're
the
defense
lawyer
you're
not
going
to
allow
that
focus
to
be
made
at
the
time
of
the
basic
guilty/not
guilty
finding,
are
you?
