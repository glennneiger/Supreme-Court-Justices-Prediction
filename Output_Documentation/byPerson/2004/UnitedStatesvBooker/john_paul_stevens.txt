justice
john
paul
stevens
that
just
proves
they
don't
listen
to
me
as
much
as
they
should.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
or
he
makes
a
mistake
in
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
finds
a
gun
when
there
really
wasn't
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clement,
following
up
on
justice
kennedy's
thought,
if
we
adhere
to
the
strict
language
in
apprendi
itself,
as
quoted
below,
any...
solely
on
the
facts
reflected
in
the
jury
verdict
or
the
plea
bargain,
that's...
that
establishes
the
maximum.
what
percent
of
the
total
number
of
sentences
that
are
imposed
in
the,
by
the
federal
system
today
would
violate
that
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let's
look
at
the
future
and
assume
that
in
97
percent
of
the
cases
which
are
plea
bargains,
you
could
agree
on
what
the
relevant
facts
are.
that
certainly
could
be
done.
and
in
the
3
percent
that
are
trialed,
it
is
my
impression
that
a
very
small
number
of
those
actually
involve
violations
of
the
apprendi
rule.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
it's
relevant
because
underlying
all
this
is
a
question
if
the
guidelines
fail
in
toto,
or
do
they
only
fail
with
respect
to
those
relevant
small
number
of
cases
in
which
there's
a
violation
of
the
apprendi
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
raising
the
issue,
it
depends
on
what...
the
issue
you
describe.
a
lot
of
people
describe
it
as
an
issue
when
you
just
use
the
guidelines
at
all.
do
they
raise
an
issue,
involve
it
in
a
sentence
over
and
above
the
amount
that
would
be
authorized
by
either
the
jury
verdict
or
the
plea
bargain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
65
percent
of
the
cases
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
all,
of
course,
involve
a
potential
upward
adjustment.
but
do
they
all
involve
actual
sentences
above
the
amount
that
the
jury
verdict
would
have
authorized?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
that...
i'm
sorry,
but
i
really,
it's
very
important
to
me.
raising
an
issue,
the
issue
is
always
raised
when
there's
a
possibility
of
a
higher
sentence,
but
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
65
percent
of
the
sentences
of
tried
cases
actually
resulted
in
sentences
higher
than
what
the
jury
verdict
would
have
authorized.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
potentially
that
every
case
does.
but
if
in
fact,
most
sentences
come
within
the
maximum
anyway,
it's
of
course
a
serious
problem
in
those
cases,
but
system-wide,
it's
not
nearly
the
problem
that
the
figures
you've
mentioned
suggest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
consider
the
word
court
to
mean
jury.
jury
or
a
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
means
that
if
a
different
procedure
is
followed,
you'll
reach
precisely
the
same
sentences
the
guidelines
reached.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
judges
reach
different
results
on
factual
issues
than
juries
do?
is
that
part
of
your
submission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
keep
it
simple
because
we're
assuming
that
in
most
cases,
there
aren't
a
host
of
factors
but
usually
just
two
or
three,
such
as
the
drug
quantity
and
did
he...
a
gun.
now
in
those
where
there's
a
fairly
simple
fact
to
identify,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
the
ultimate
sentence
that's
imposed
whether
the
jury
finds
it
or
the
judge
finds
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
keep
to
the
bad
example
i've
given
you.
the
gun
and
the
drug
quantity.
why
would
it
make
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there's
a
difference
in
sentence
depending
on
the
on
the
amount
of
money
that
the
fraud
involved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
that
case...
let's
take
them
one
at
a
time.
in
that
case,
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
jury
made
the
finding
or
the
judge
made
the
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
then
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--now
can
you
hand
me
a
case
in
which
it
would
make
a
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
a
very
large
fraud
such
as
you've
described
could
be
proved
through
two
or
three
witnesses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
used
the
internet
and
they
had
all
said...
i
am
not
persuaded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clement
can
i...
you
don't
have
an
awful
lot
of
time
left,
and
i
want
to
ask
you
one
rather
important
question,
to
me.
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
severability
of
the
statute,
and
i
can
understand
the
concept
that
we'll
only
apply
it
in
certain
categories
of
cases.
but
normally
when
i
consider
severability,
i'm
thinking
of
the
text
of
a
written
statute.
is
there
a
particular
provision
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
that
you
think
can
be
severed
from
the
rest
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
sticking
to
the
statute,
take
out
3553(b)
in
its
entirety,
you
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
just
not
sure
what's
left
of
the
whole
statute
if
you
take
that
provision
out
entirely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
sets
the
sentence
within
the
range
authorized
by
the
jury's
verdict.
that's
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
why
you
wouldn't
have
the
same
alternatives
under
your
view.
because
is
it
not
correct
that
if
the,
if
the
sentence...
the
change
under
consideration
is
a
decrease,
those
findings
should
be
made
by
a
judge.
whereas,
if
it's
an
increase,
you'd
say
they
have
to
be
found
by
a
jury.
so
why
don't
you
have
the
same
possibility
of
a
two-track
system
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
say...
you
would
say
your
proposal
is
closer
to
what
congress
really
wanted,
because
it
would
leave
in
place
all
of
the
sentences
that
would
be
commanded
by
the
guidelines,
but
just
require
a
different
fact
finder
in
some
of
the
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
interrupt
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
one
thing
that's
running
through
my
mind.
what
if
the
defendant
gets
on
the
stand
and
testifies
to
a
version
of
the
events
that
the
jury
must
have
disbelieved
in
order
to
convict?
could
not
the
judge...
in
effect,
he
would
be
making
the
finding...
he
would
say,
"the
jury
has
really
found
this
fact,
and,
therefore,
i
can
rely
on
it.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
do
that?
the
statute
that
makes
the
guidelines
mandatory
applies
to
both
upwards
and
downwards
departures,
so
i
have
always
had
trouble
knowing
what
provision
of
the
statute
anybody
severs.
i
can
understand
your
saying
that
there's
a
bunch
of
unconstitutional
applications
of
the
statute,
and
you
have
to
set
aside
the
sentences
in
those
particular
cases,
but
i
simply
don't
understand
severing
a
single
provision
that
covers
both
upward
and
downward
departures.
how
do
you
sever
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
the
same,
that's
the
same
provision
that
allows
departures
of
the
same...
by
the
same
procedure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you're
not
severing
a
piece
of
a
statute,
you're
just
severing
a
bunch
of
applications
of
the
statute
you
think
are
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
may
i
add
this
thought,
that
it
seems
to
me,
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
true;
mr.
clement
and
i
had
a
dialogue
that
was
inconclusive;
i
had
been
under
the
impression,
perhaps
erroneous,
that
in
fact
the
number
of
unconstitutional
departures
if
one
follows
apprendi
as
being
the
constitutional
rule,
is
actually
a
small
percentage
of
the
total,
and
if
it
should
follow
that
only
three,
four,
five,
six
percent
of
the
sentences
that
have
heretofore
been
imposed
or
will
be
imposed
in
the
future
would
be
unconstitutional,
that's
a
pretty
weak
reason
for
saying
the
whole
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
or
even
in
one
provision
of
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
you
just
say,
"oh,
okay,
you
can't
impose
those
sentences
in
those
three
percent
of
the
cases.
"
i
don't
know
why
that's
a
departure
from
our
prior
practice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
my
suggestion
is
everybody
can
be
sentenced
under
the
guidelines;
the
only
difference
is
that
in
three
or
four
percent
of
the
cases
you
may
have
to
bring
a
jury
in
to
get
an
enhanced
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
read
justice
thomas's
opinion
in
apprendi?
he's
got
a
lot
of
prior
law
in
there
that
maybe
would
be
of
interest
to
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one,
one
last
question?
do
you
agree
that
within
the
guidelines
ranges,
which
sometimes
are
fairly
large,
that
a
judge
does
have
the
discretion
to
impose
any
sentences
he
wants
to
based
on
the
conduct
of
the
defendant,
whether
or
not
it's
proved
to
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
get
to
the
range
by
the
jury
finding,
the
judge
still
retains
substantial
discretion
within
the,
within
the
range.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
an
opinion
to
announce
in
united
states
against
booker
and
united
states
against
fanfan.
these
cases
present
two
questions:
the
first
whether
a
sentence
imposed
pursuant
to
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
violates
the
sixth
amendment
when
it
is
made
more
severe
by
facts
that
were
not
found
by
a
jury
or
admitted
by
the
defendant
but
instead
were
found
a
by
judge.
following
our
decisions
in
appredi
against
new
jersey,
jones
against
the
united
states,
ring
against
arizona
and
blakely
against
washington,
we
answer
that
question
in
the
affirmative
and
hold
that
the
applications
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
in
these
cases
violated
the
sixth
amendment.
that
holding
leads
the
court
to
a
second
question,
whether
the
remedy
for
these
unconstitutional
applications
makes
it
necessary
to
invalidate
all
or
any
part
of
the
guidelines.
in
a
separate
opinion
for
the
court,
justice
breyer
explains
the
court's
holding
that
two
provisions
of
the
federal
sentencing
statute
must
be
invalidated
in
all
of
their
applications
in
order
to
conform
the
guidelines
to
the
requirement
of
the
sixth
amendment.
respondent,
booker
was
charged
under
a
federal
statute
that
criminalizes
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
50
or
more
grams
of
crack
cocaine.
the
jury
found
him
guilty
of
violating
the
statute
on
the
basis
of
evidence
that
he
had
carried
92
grams
of
crack
in
his
duffel
bag.
the
specific
statutory
provision
under
which
booker
was
prosecuted
sets
a
minimum
sentence
of
10
years
of
imprisonment
and
a
maximum
sentence
of
life.
however,
the
judge
did
not
have
the
discretion
to
impose
any
sentence
within
that
range.
rather
under
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines,
the
combination
of
the
jury's
finding
that
he
possessed
92
grams
of
crack
and
the
judge's
evaluation
of
booker's
criminal
history
established
a
maximum
sentence
of
262
months
in
prison.
that
sentencing
range
was
increased
when
the
judge
made
his
own
findings
based
on
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
booker
actually
possessed
an
additional
566
grams
of
crack
and
was
guilty
of
obstructing
justice.
under
the
guidelines,
those
additional
findings
required
the
judge
to
impose
a
sentence
between
360
months
and
life
imprisonment.
the
sentence
that
the
judge
actually
imposed
was
over
eight
years
longer
than
the
sentence
booker
could
have
received
based
solely
on
the
facts
found
by
the
jury.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
booker's
sentence
violated
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
be
tried
by
an
impartial
jury.
the
court's
decision
was
based
on
the
principle
we
applied
in
appredi
and
blakely.
other
than
the
fact
of
a
prior
conviction,
any
fact
that
increases
the
penalty
for
a
crime
beyond
the
prescribed
statutory
maximum
must
be
submitted
to
a
jury
and
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
under
the
guidelines,
the
relevant
"statutory
maximum"
is
the
maximum
sentence
that
a
judge
may
lawfully
impose
solely
on
the
basis
of
facts
reflected
in
the
jury
verdict
or
admitted
by
the
defendant.
the
government
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
which
we
granted
along
with
its
petition
for
certiorari
before
judgment
in
a
similar
care
that
rose
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
maine.
we
consolidated
the
two
cases
to
consider
whether
those
courts
had
correctly
concluded
that
our
decision
in
blakely
applies
to
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines.
in
agreement
with
those
courts,
we
now
hold
that
there
is
no
distinction
of
constitutional
significance
between
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
and
the
sentencing
procedure
we
held
invalid
in
blakely.
our
dissenting
colleagues
in
that
case
properly
recognized
that
the
structure
of
the
federal
system
does
not
provide
any
grounds
for
distinction.
like
the
federal
guidelines,
the
washington
sentencing
regime
was
binding
on
judges.
it
required
sentencing
judges
to
impose
a
standard
sentence
within
a
narrow
range
that
could
be
exceeded
only
if
judges
made
additional
factual
findings.
under
such
a
sentencing
regime,
criminal
defendants
are
entitled
to
a
determinant
sentence
that
can
be
raised
or
lowered
on
the
basis
of
specific
factual
findings.
given
the
impact
of
such
findings
on
the
defendant's
liberty,
the
sixth
amendment
includes
the
right
to
insist
that
a
jury
find
such
facts
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
regardless
of
whether
they
are
labeled
elements
of
a
crime
or
sentencing
factors.
this
understanding
of
the
sixth
amendment
not
only
reflects
our
common
law
tradition
but
also
is
essential
if
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
is
to
retain
its
functional
content
in
the
context
of
modern
determinant
sentencing
regime.
the
fact
that
the
guidelines
were
promulgated
by
the
sentencing
commission
rather
than
by
congress
does
not
affect
the
constitutional
infirmity
in
booker's
sentence.
the
guidelines
functionally
operate
a
statutory
maximum
despite
the
fact
that
they
are
written
by
a
commission
by
binding
the
discretion
of
sentencing
judges
with
indeterminate
ranges.
we
are
similarly
unpersuaded
by
the
government's
argument
that
our
holding
is
inconsistent
with
separation
of
powers
principles
or
with
any
of
our
prior
cases.
accordingly,
following
apprendi,
jones,
ring
and
blakely,
we
hold
that
any
fact
other
than
the
fact
of
a
prior
conviction
that
has
the
effect
of
increasing
a
defendant's
maximum
sentence
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
must
be
admitted
by
the
defendant
or
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
for
these
reasons,
booker
should
not
have
been
sentenced
to
the
additional
18
years
for
facts
that
were
merely
found
a
by
judge
to
be
more
likely
true
than
not.
the
sixth
amendment
requires
that
those
facts
be
found
by
a
jury
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
the
opinion
i
have
just
announced

joined
by
justice
scalia,

breyer

dissenting

as

of

that

by

in

before

i
shall
briefly
state
that
the
four
justices
who
do
not
join
the
court's
remedial
conclusion
believe
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
invalidate
any
part
of
the
guidelines
or
the
sentencing
statute.
we
are
convinced
that
the
guidelines
and
the
federal
sentencing
statute
properly
interpreted
can
be
applied
as
written
in
a
manner
that
is
more
faithful
to
congressional
intent
and
the
sixth
amendment
than
the
remedy
that
the
court
adopts
today.
prior
to
our
decision
today,
judges
and
prosecutors
had
made
considerable
progress
in
bringing
federal
sentencing
practices
under
the
guidelines
into
compliance
with
our
holding
in
blakely
just
as
they
did
after
our
decision
in
apprendi.
in
our
view,
the
court
should
have
allowed
that
process
to
go
forward.
if
the
majority
is
correct
in
its
reading
a
legislative
intent,
congress
could
and
presumably
would
have
enacted
by
itself
the
reforms
that
the
majority
orders
today.
i
believe
the
court
should
have
allowed
congress
to
decide
whether
future
legislation
is
necessary
or
appropriate
for
it
is
congress,
not
this
court
that
is
best
qualified
to
perform
the
task
of
crafting
legislation
consistent
with
the
goals
of
sentencing
reform
and
the
sixth
amendment.
now
justice
breyer
will
explain
why
my
views
concerning
the
remedy
did
not
carry
today.
