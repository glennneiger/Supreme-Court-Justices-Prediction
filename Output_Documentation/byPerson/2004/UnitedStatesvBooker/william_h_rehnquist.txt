chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
04-104,
united
states
against
freddie
j.
booker
and
04-105,
united
states
against
duncan
fanfan.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
mistretta
it
might
have
come
out
the
other
way
had
it
not
been
for
that
observation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
assuming
that
in
the
case
of,
say,
perjury
at
trial,
you
couldn't
possibly
allege
that
in
the
indictment
because
you
won't
know.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
this
court
said
the
guidelines
are
unconstitutional,
period,
and
then
judges
simply
looked
to
the
guidelines,
figuring,
well,
this
is
as
good
an
idea
as
anybody
else
has
about
sentencing?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
clement.
mr.
kelly,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
whoa.
what
if,
what
if
the
statute
says
"every
felony
in
this
state
shall
be
punished
by
a
term
of
not
less
than
one
year,
or,
on
the
other
side,
life.
"
and
you're
committed
to
the
parole
authority,
and
the
parole
authority
will
decide
between
those
boundaries?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
form
of
verdict
under
your
system?
is
there
one
line
for
the
basic
offense,
and
then
other
lines
for
each
additional
factor
that's
alleged
in
the
indictment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
suggesting,
then,
a
special...
a
special
verdict
in
every
case
where
there
are
guideline
facts
to
be
found.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kelly.
ms.
scapicchio.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
conspiracy
to
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
trial
judge
give
any
indication
of
what
sentence
he
would
have
imposed
if
he
were
not
constrained
by
the
guidelines?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
wouldn't
sever
out
the
ones
that
would
permit
a
downward
departure,
would
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
leave
in
place
the
provisions
for
downward
departures?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and...
but
could
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
leave
in
place
the
provisions
for
downward
departure?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
it...
would
it
really
save
the
guidelines
in
the
way
that
congress
intended
them,
to
strike
basically
the
provision
for
enhancements,
and
leaving
in
place
the
provisions
for
downward
departures?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
will
there
be
proportionality
if
the
sentences,
sentences
can
be
downward,
the
jury
verdict
could
be
adjusted
downward,
but
not
upward?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
say
the
same
thing
if
we
simply
said
that
the
whole
guidelines
fall,
and
they're
simply
there
for
judges
to
apply
if
they
wish.
you
can
say,
"well,
if
congress
doesn't
like
that
they
can
come
in
and
put
a
new
system.
"
that's
true
any
time
congress
acts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
ms.
scapicchio.
mr.
clement,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clement,
the
case
is
submitted.
