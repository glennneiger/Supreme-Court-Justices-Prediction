mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
and
these
cases,
concern
the
constitutionality
of
the
twelve
hundred
criminal
sentencings
that
take
place
in
federal
court
each
week.
if
this
court
re-affirms
its
traditional
understanding
of
the
relationship
between
the
guidelines,
and
the
statutory
maximum
penalties
set
forth
in
the
united
states
code,
an
understanding
reflected
in
a
series
of
this
court's
decisions
dealing
with
the
guidelines,
than
the
constitutionality
of
those
criminal
sentencings
remains
secure.
on
the
other
hand,
if
this
court
takes
a
different
view,
and
treats
the
outer
bounds
of
the
guideline
ranges
as
if
they
were
statutory
maximums,
then
the
majority
of
those
criminal
sentencings
become
constitutionally
dubious,
and
this
court
must
confront
difficult
remedial
issues.
this
is,
of
course,
not
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
confronted
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
guidelines
or
to
the
commission.
to
be
sure,
in
those
previous
cases,
this
court
has
never
considered
the
precise
sixth
amendment
issue
before
the
court
today.
but,
nonetheless,
those
previous
cases
are
instructive,
because
all
of
those
cases,
dunnigan,
witte,
watts,
and
edwards,
all
reflect
a
particular
understanding
of
the
relationship
between
the
guidelines
and
the
statutory
maximum
sentences
for
each
specific
crime
defined
in
the
united
states
code.
and
all
of
those
decisions
suggest
that
the
statutory
maximum
in
the
code
is
the
relevant
focal
point
for
constitutional
analysis.
so,
in
the
witte
case,
for
example,
the
finding
of
relevant
conduct
in
the
witte
case
increased
his
sentence
under
the
guidelines
by
two
hundred
months.
nonetheless,
this
court
rejected
the
double
jeopardy
challenge
before
the
court
by
emphasizing
that
that
consideration
of
relevant
conduct
did
not
increase
his
penalty
beyond
the
statutory
maximum.
likewise
in
the
edwards
case,
this
court
considered
the
propriety
of
a
judicial
finding
of
crack
cocaine
that
increased
the
guideline
sentence,
when
the
jury
was
instructed
in
the
alternative,
to
find
cocaine
or
crack.
now,
even
though
the
judicial
finding
had
the
effect
of
raising
the
punishment
under
the
guidelines,
this
court
found
no
serious
sixth
amendment
issue
raised
precisely
because
the
effect
of
the
judge's
finding
did
not
take
the
sentence
beyond
the
maximum
for
that
cocaine-only
conspiracy.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
in
the
edwards
case,
a
sixth
amendment
issue
and,
i
think,
fairly
including
the
jury
trial,
was
raised
in
that
case.
now,
i
tried
to
go
back
and
look
briefs
in
that
case
and
i
have
to
admit,
they're
a
little
difficult
to
get
through
in
terms
of
the
precise
issue
that
was
being
raised.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it
was
argued,
i
think,
fairly
clearly
in
the
watts
case,
i
mean,
there
was
a
section...
watts,
of
course,
was
a
summary
reversal,
so
you
have
to
go
and
look
at
the
brief
in
opposition
in
the
watts
case.
and
if
you
do,
there's
a
separate
paragraph
in
the
arguments
section
denominated
the
jury
trial
right.
and
i
think
in
some
respects,
the
watts
case
is
a
particularly
clear
indicator
that
this
court
has
rejected
the
view
of
the
guidelines
that
respondents
embrace.
because
justice
stevens
was
quite
prophetic
in
his
dissent
in
that
case.
he
embraced
the
precise
understanding
of
the
significance
of
the
outer
bound
of
the
guidelines
range
in
his
watts
dissent,
and
no
member
of
this
court
joined
that
dissent,
and
no
member
found
the
disposition
with
respect
to
watts--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
may
very
well
prove
that,
justice
stevens,
because
you
were
very
clear
about
the
point,
just
to
remind
you,
in
the
watts
case
there
were
two
cases
before
the
court,
there
was
the
putra
case,
and
there
was
the
watts
case,
they
were
consolidated.
and
with
respect
to
putra,
you
can
envision
that
case,
or
characterize
that
case
as
being
sort
of
a
collateral
estoppel,
double
jeopardy
case,
but
as
you
correctly
recognized,
very
clearly,
in
your
watts
dissent,
with
respect
to
mr.
watts,
the
finding,
the
criminal
finding
of
acquittal
was
based
on
924(c),
which
requires
use
of
a
gun.
the
sentencing
enhancement
was
done
based
on
an
enhancing
factor
that
only
requires
possession
of
a
gun.
so
there
wasn't
any
collateral
estoppel
effect
in
that
case.
but,
nonetheless,
in
your
dissent
you
pointed
out,
in
footnotes
2
and
4
that
it
still
had
the
effect
of
raising
his
sentence
above
the
outer
bound
of
the
guidelines
range,
and
that,
because
that
was
done
on
the
basis
of
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
rather
than
a
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard,
that
that
raised
a
constitutional
problem,
and
you
would
have
reversed.
the
rest
of
the
court
was
happy
to
summarily
reverse
in
that
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i'd
like
to
make
two
observations.
one,
i
don't
think
the
jury
trial
right
is
just
a
juxtaposition
of
the
role
of
the
jury
versus
the
role
of
the
judge,
because
if
that
were
the
only
factor
at
issue
in
this
court's
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
explain
why
it
is
that
judicial
fact-finding
can
have
the
effects
that
it
can
under
a
purely
discretionary
system,
yet
this
court
has
upheld
that
time
and
time
again.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make,
is
i
do
think
that
this
court's
apprendi
to
blakely
line
of
cases--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
there...
there
certainly
is
a
difference
between
sentencing
under
the
guidelines,
versus
a
system
of
discretionary
sentencing,
or
even
a
system
of
discretionary
sentencing
where
the
guidelines
have
an
advisory
character,
i'd
certainly
concede
that.
my
point
was,
though,
in
making
a
distinction
between
the
role
of
the
jury
and
the
judge,
it's
not
just
as
simple
as
saying
that
the
jury
trial
right
exists
precisely
to
protect
the
jury
from
the
judge,
because
if
that
were
the
case,
the
kind
of
fact-finding
that
judge
lynch
engaged
in,
or
the
kind
of
fact
finding
that
was
commonplace
under
discretionary
sentencing
also
takes
roles
away
from
the
jury,
and
gives
them
to
the
judge.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
think
you've
built
in
some
assumptions
into
that
question,
because
under
our
system,
generally
speaking
if
somebody
wants
to
know
what
the
maximum
exposure
for
a
particular
criminal
offense
is,
they
would
be
well-advised
to
look
at
the
u.s.
code
provision
that
specifies
what
the
maximum
sentence
is
for
that
offense,
because
that
is
their
exposure,
that's
what
they're
told
about
in
their
rule
colloquy
if
they
plead
to
the
crime,
and
if
the
judge
makes
certain
findings,
to
be
sure,
upward
departure,
whatever
it
takes
in
a
particular
case,
that
is
the
maximum
exposure
that
the
individual--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--unless
the
judge
departs
for
some
other
reason,
or
the
like.
i
mean,
certainly
that's
true--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
suppose
that's
true,
too.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
so
there
are
different
ways
that
you
could
get
that
sentence
under
the
guidelines
system.
but
if
there's
no
mistake,
and
no
departure
on
some
of
the
grounds,
we
both
understand,
i
think,
how
the
guidelines
work
and
you're
describing
it
correctly.
but
still,
that
is
a
finding
that
is
only
necessary
because
of
the
determination
of
the
commission
and
the
guidelines,
and
that
brings
us
back
to
the
question--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
would
not
concede
that,
justice
ginsburg,
but
let
me
first
make
clear
that
in
the
case
before
us
today,
the
guidelines
that
we
have
are
promulgated
by
the
commission,
and
were
not
the
direct
or
indirect
result
of
a
congressional
act
the
way
that
the,
say,
the
protect
act
added
particular
amendments
to
the
guidelines,
so
that
question
is
not
directly
posed
in
this
case.
the
reason
i
would
say
that
even
in
that
case
there
is
a
difference
is
because
it
is
still
different
when
congress
goes
in
and
amends
a
particular
guideline
in
a
sense
in
a
sea
of
guidelines
provided
by
the
commission.
and
i
think
that's
true,
one,
because
amending
a
single
guideline
doesn't
change
the
overall
character
of
the
guidelines.
but
also
because,
when
congress
decides
to
take
action
not
as
a
statute,
but
as
an
amendment
to
a
guideline,
it
doesn't
change
the
fundamental
character
of
the
guideline
as
a
guideline.
and
so
after...
the
protect
act
for
example,
specifies
a
period
in
which...
after
which
the
commission
can
then
amend
that
guideline.
which
is
obviously
not
a
case
that
you
can
have
with
a
statute
consistent
with
the
presentment
clause.
and
to
just
give
you
another
example,
the
sentencing
reform
act
that
has
brought
us
here
today,
one
of
the
things
it
did
was
make
specific
amendments
to
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
32.
i
think
when
congress
does
that,
it
doesn't
make
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
32
a
statute,
it
continues
to
be
a
federal
rule,
the
federal
rules
advisory
committee
can
still
modify
it
after
the
fact,
and
so
i
think
even
in
that
case,
there's
a
difference
in
effect.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
it
should
make...
well,
i
guess
what
i
would
respond
to
that,
justice
souter,
is
this.
i
think
that
one
thing
that
emerges
from
this
court's
recent
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence,
is
that
the
impact
on
the
defendant
himself
or
herself
is
not
the
only
test
that
this
court
looks
to.
because
from
the
perspective
of
an
individual
defendant,
they
don't
care
if
they've
gotten
five
extra
years
because
a
judge
made
a
finding
under
a
discretionary
regime,
or
they
got
five
extra
years
because
the
judge
made
a
finding
that
the
legislature
told
the
judge
to
make,
the
practical
effect
is
the
same.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
again,
as
justice
stevens
suggested
earlier,
i
mean,
that
may
be
true
if
you
focus
in
on
that
single
fact
under
the
guideline
system,
but
under
the
myriad
of
various
ways
that
your
guidelines
sentence
can
go
up
or
down,
it
may
be
inappropriate
under
the
federal
guideline
system
to
focus
in
on
the
point
of
analysis
on
that
particular
interval,
of
just
the
one--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--because,
again,
as
a
defendant,
you
may
have
a
case
where
there
are
five
or
six
potential
enhancements,
and
there
are
five
or
six
potential
departures,
and
your
sentence
is
going
to
be
a
product
of
the
judicial
fact
finding
that
goes
in,
in
making
those
various
conclusions--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
disagree
with
that
characterization
of
the
guidelines,
but
i
still
think
that
it
is
a
difference
from
a
pure
statutory
scheme,
it's
different
from
a
scheme
like
this
court
had
before
in
blakely
against
washington,
where
the
statute
focuses
you
in
on
just
a
couple
of
factors
and
you
really
can
re-conceptualize
that
regime
as
providing
for
a
base
offense
level
and
one
or
two
aggravated
grades
of
the
offense.
as
judge
lynch
observed
in
language
that
we
quote
on
page
4
of
our
reply
brief,
you
really
can't
re-conceptualize
the
guideline
system
that
way.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
agree,
justice
souter,
and
the
point
isn't
that
it's
more
complicated.
if
i
just
continue
with
judge
lynch's
observation,
which,
as
i
say,
is
quoted
on
page
four
of
our
reply
brief,
it's
not
just
that
it's
complicated,
it's
that
the
mission
of
the
guidelines
system
is,
once,
assuming
that
somebody's
been
convicted
of
some
federal
crime
with
certain
elements
defined
by
congress,
then,
what
the
guidelines
ask
the
judge
to
do
is
evaluate
the
incident
of
criminal
activity
and
assess
an
appropriate
punishment
without
regard
to
whether
it
has
met
the
certain
elements
of
a
particular
federal
crime.
and
so,
the
really,
the
focus
is
quite
different,
and
in
that
sense,
i
think
there
is,
there
is
more
than
a
difference
in
form
between
a
set
of
guidelines
produced
by
a
legislature
and
a
set
of
guidelines
produced
by
the
sentencing
commission.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
there
are
differences
between
the
two.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
washington
system
that
you
had
before
you
in
the
blakely
case,
it
was
a
product
of
the
legislature,
and
so,
not
surprisingly,
there
is
a
focus
on
the
crimes
as
defined
by
the
legislature,
there
was
a
presumptive
range
for
each
crime,
and
then
there
were
a
handful
of
things
that
got
you
into...
added
three
years,
like
a
firearm,
and
then
there
was
basically
the
upward
departure
authority
or
the
downward
departure
authority,
and
that
was
it.
and
that
makes
sense;
a
legislature
is
going
to
be
predominantly
focused
on
the
statutorily
defined
crimes.
in
the
context
of
the
guidelines,
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
a
much
more
widely
variant
focused,
and
what
it's
focusing
on
is
the
criminal
activity
as
a
whole.
there
are
many
factors
that
can
increase
it,
there's
many
factors
that
can
decrease
it,
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
in
that,
in
that
context
we
would
be
limited
to
an
argument
to
asking
this
court
to
overrule
blakely.
but
that
is
not
to
say
that,
that,
what
i
want
to
make
the
point,
though,
is
ultimately
if
pushed...
and
your
hypothetical
pushes
us...
if
pushed,
the
argument
is
one
of
form,
that
the
fact
that
these
emanate
from
the
sentencing
commission
makes
a
constitutional
difference.
but
i
don't
want
to
lose
the
fact
in
making
that
concession
that
there
is
still
a
real
difference
between
the
way
the
federal
guidelines
work
and
the
way
the
washington
guidelines
work,
and
the
federal
guidelines
work
exactly
as
you
would
expect:
sentencing
guidelines
promulgated
by
an
entity
located
in
the
article
iii
branch,
and
consisting
of
article
iii
members;
and
the
washington
guidelines
system
works--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
true,
justice
ginsburg,
but
there--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it's
still
in
the
judicial
branch,
justice
scalia,
and
there
are
the
same
number
of
judicial
members
on
the
commission
now
as
there
were
when
this
court
considered
the
mistretta
decision.
and
i
think
mistretta
itself
recognized
that
we
could
have
bodies
located
in
the
judicial
branch
that
were
auxiliary
to
the
judicial
branch,
even
if
they
consisted,
quote,
"solely
of
non-judges".
so
i
don't
think
that's
what's
dispositive.
i
think
what's
dispositive
ultimately
is
what
this
court
recognized
in
the
mistretta
decision.
in
the
mistretta
decision,
this
court
made
clear
that
the
commission
was
constitutionally
located
in
the
article
iii
branch
precisely
because
it
did
not
take
on
the
quintessentially
legislative
tasks
of
setting
maximum
punishments
and
defining
the
elements
of
federal
crimes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
can
talk
more
about
that
in
terms
of
the
separability
issue,
which
is
question
two.
but
i
think
especially
if
you
get
to
the
point
where
prospectively
the
proposal
is
to
treat
sentencing
enhancement
factors
under
the
guidelines
exactly
as
if
they're
elements
of
federal
crimes,
they
would
have
to
be
included
in
indictments
and
have
to
be
charged
to
the
jury
on
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
then
i
don't
see
how
mistretta
survives
anymore
or
at
least
how
mistretta
allows
that
particular
judicial
remedy
to
go
forward.
because
at
that
point,
you've
really
had
the
commission
become
transformed
into
precisely
what
this
court
said
it
wasn't,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
in
the
mistretta
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
kennedy,
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
respondents'
position...
they
can
obviously
speak
for
themselves
to
this
point,
but
i
think
the
thrust
of
their
position
is
in
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound,
that
if
you
extend
blakely
to
the
guidelines,
then
that's
it,
the
guidelines
go
out.
i
think
the
consequence
of
accepting
the
government's
position
here,
that
the
guidelines
are
different,
would
not
foreclose
the
possibility
for
a
more
fine-tuned
analysis
that
focused
on
the
particular
effects
of
particular
guidelines
ranges,
or
the
particularly
enhancing
factors
and
the
like.
and
i
think
one
thing
that
ought
to
give
the
court
caution
before
it
extends
blakely
all
the
way
to
the
guidelines
is,
if
you
look
at
the
guidelines,
there
are
certainly
some
enhancing
factors
or
some
factors
that
increase
punishment
under
the
guidelines,
that
look
nothing
like
any
traditional
element
of
any
crime.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
mean,
two
things,
justice
kennedy.
i
don't
want
to
get
too
far
afield
in
the
sense
that
we
think
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
court
could
distinguish
the
guidelines
and
could
still
maintain
the
very
bright
line
of
blakely
as
applies
to
legislative
enactments.
but
if
this
court
were
going
to
either,
with
respect
to
legislative
enactments
or
in
the
particular
field
of
the
guidelines,
try
to
develop
another
test
to
differentiate
elements
from...
i'm
sorry,
elements
from
sentencing
factors,
i
think
this
court
could
get
guidance
in
the
same
kind
of
analysis
that
it's
done
in
the
context
of
affirmative
defenses.
as
apprendi
itself
recognized,
in
the
patterson
case,
this
court
decided
that
in
that
context,
it
would
not
adopt
one
bright
line
or
another
and
just
give
up
the
enterprise
of
drawing
lines
in
between.
and
i
think
a
similar
enterprise
could
be
done
under
the
guise
of
dealing
with
the
guidelines.
but
i
think
the
thrust
of
the
government's
position
here
today
is
that
you
shouldn't
accept
the
respondent's
particular
challenge
to
the
guidelines
because
that
does
have
the
effect
of
"in
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound.
"
and
wiping
the
guidelines
out.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
stevens,
let
me
try
to
answer
it
as
best
as
i
can.
i
want
to
make
the
observation,
though,
that
the
only
estimate
i
can
give
you
is
based
on
retrospective
data,
obviously,
and
it
could
be--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
not
sure
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
let
me
answer
it
this
way,
because
i
can
only
answer
it
based
on
the
data
i
have.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
understand,
and
let
me
answer
it
this
way,
which
is
looking
retrospectively
at
the
data
from
2002.
if
you
consider
all
the
cases
that
either
went
to
trial
or
pled
and
that,
they're
not
differentiated,
the
two
aren't
differentiated,
then
about
65
percent
of
the
cases
raise
a
potential
blakely
or
apprendi
type
issue,
so
that
would
be
the
starting
point
for
the
analysis.
now,
as
you
pointed--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
that's
65--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
numbers
that
we
have
is
65
percent.
basically,
you
have
44
percent
of
the
cases
involve
some
chapter
ii
or
chapter
iii
enhancement
or
adjustment
to
the
base
level.
and
then
we've
kind
of
looked,
in
addition
to
the
44
percent,
we've
looked
at
the
drug
cases,
which
by
the
nature
of
the
drug
sentencing
table,
virtually
all
of
the
drug
cases,
if
they
don't
implicate
a
mandatory
minimum,
involve
a
potential
blakely
upward
adjustment.
and
so
what
we've
done
is,
in
looking
at
these
numbers,
is
to
basically
take
all
the
drug
cases
and
then
subtract
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
again,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
know,
because
that
comes
to
a
second
question,
which
is,
if
i
understand
your
question,
which
is,
we
know
that
65
percent
of
the
cases
raise
a
potentially,
a
potential
blakely
issue.
then
the
question
is,
well,
if
97
percent
of
the
cases
settle,
is
there
a
way
to
sort
of
waive
blakely
rights
and
the
like,
and
make
this
workable
going
forward?
and
it's
hard
to
know
what
the,
what,
what
system
will
emerge.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
again,
i
can
only
give
you
the
numbers--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--again,
justice
stevens,
i
want
to
answer
as
best
i
can.
the
figures
i
have
suggest
that
65
percent
of
the
cases
do
involve
an
upward
adjustment
of
some
kind.
and
so
there
is
a
blakely
problem.
so
the
only
real
question
is,
all
right,
65
percent
of
the
cases
in
the
world
where
nobody
thought
blakely
was
a
problem
for
the
guidelines
involve
those
kind
of
upward
adjustments.
there
may
be
ways
through
plea
agreements
and
the
like
to
have
people
waive
their
blakely
rights
in
certain
ways
that
may
make
the
system
work
a
little
bit
better
or
deal
with
a
slightly
reduced
number
of
cases.
but
i
think
any
way
you
slice
this,
this
is
going
to
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
reality
of
criminal
sentencing
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i,
well
let
me
try
to
address
the
remedial
question
then
going
forward.
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
blakely
is
fully
applicable
to
the
guidelines,
then
that's
going
to
raise
some
very
serious
and
complex
remedial
questions.
one
question,
though,
i
think
ought
to
be
clear,
is
that
one
option
that
shouldn't
be
on
the
table
is
the
idea
that
on
a
prospective
basis,
the
guidelines
are
severable
in
a
way
that
makes
all
enhancements
or
all
upward
adjustments
completely
unavailable,
and
all
downward
departures
fully
available.
because
that
system
is
obviously
nothing
that
congress
intended.
now
respondents,
for
their
part,
don't
propose
that
rule,
although
they
want
to
benefit
from
effectively
that
rule
for
their
own
cases.
what
they
suggest
is
that
on
a
going-forward
basis,
you
could
include
the
sentencing
enhancing
factors
as,
in
the
indictment
and
then
send
them
to
the
jury
as
effectively
de
facto
elements
of
the
crime
to
be
found
by
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now
with
respect,
i
think
that
so-called
blakely-ization
of
the
guidelines
creates
an
enormous
amount
of
judicial
lawmaking
and
raises
very
serious
separation
of
powers
problems.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
with
respect,
justice
souter,
i
think
it
is
fairly
ambitious
judicial
lawmaking.
you
do
have
to
take
out
a
fair
amount
of
text
to
get
the
sentencing
judge
effectively
out
of
the
business
of
fact-finding.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you
have
to
take
out
the
reference
in
3553(b),
that
talks
about
what
the
courts
find,
and
then
it
makes
a
definite
reference
to
the
court
needing
to
find
things
in
order
to
have
upward
and
downward
departures.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
i
think
then--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
plenty
of
statutes
that
refer
to
the
court
in
distinction
from
the
jury.
i
think
then
if
you
look
at
3742(e),
which
is
the
appeal
right,
if
you
look
at
3742(e),
it
makes
it
quite
clear
that
on
appeal,
courts
of
appeals
are
supposed
to
defer
to
the,
to
the
fact,
the
facts
found
by
the
district
court.
now
i
think
in
the
context
of
the
overall
provision
for
judicial
review,
that
it's
clearly
a
reference
to
the
judge,
not
to
the
jury.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
with
respect,
i
don't
think
there's
any
way
to
avoid
a
potential
unconstitutional
system
going
forward,
because
if
you
treat
these
guideline
factors
that
were
clearly
created
by
the
commission
and
in
some
cases
created
by
congress,
on
the
assumption
that
they
would
be
used
for
judge
fact-finding,
and
then
send
them
to
the
jury,
then
what
you've
done
prospectively...
it's
one
thing...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
it's
one
thing
to
recognize
that
the
guideline
factors
that
are
enhancements
have
the
effect
of
increasing
sentences
and
operate
like
elements
of
crimes
for
retrospective
constitutional
analysis,
for
finding
a
sixth
amendment
problem,
but
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
prospectively
treat
those
factors
exactly
as
if
they're
elements
of
crimes,
force
them
to
be
included
in
the
indictment,
send
them
to
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
actually
don't
think
that
follows,
justice
stevens,
because
i
think
taking
guidelines
that
were
clearly
designed
for
judge
fact
finding
and
sending
them
to
the
jury--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no.
what
my
submission
is,
is
that
taking
guidelines
that
were
designed
for
judge
fact
finding
and
sending
them
and
using
them
for
jury
fact
finding
is
going
to
have
a
very
disproportionate
impact
on
some
cases.
let
me
give
you
an
example
if
i
could,
to
make
the
point.
if
you
think
of
two
fraud
cases
that
under
the
guidelines--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it
would,
justice
stevens.
and
if
i
could...
i'll
keep
it
a
very
simple
fraud
example.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it
might
make
as
much
a
difference
in
the
drug
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
here's
how
it
could
make
a
difference,
if
i
could
use
the
fraud
example.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
then
you
may
be
able
to
see
how
it
could
or
could
not
relate
to
the
marijuana
example
or
a
drug
example.
in
the
context
of
a
fraud
case,
two
fraud
cases
that
are
sentenced
the
exact
same
way
and
treated
as
uniform
and
proportional
under
the
current
system--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in
the
number
of
victims.
and
what
you'll
have
is...
if
you
think
of
one
fraud
that
involved
one
victim
and
a
slightly
higher
amount
of
money,
and
another
fraud
that
involved
many
victims
and
a
slightly
lower
amount
of
money,
the
current
guideline
system
basically
tries
to
treat
them
the
same.
now
with
a
single
fraud
victim,
the
idea
of
blakely-izing
the
guidelines
may
be
relatively
straightforward.
you
include
the
loss
amount
in
the
indictment.
you
put
a
special
verdict
form
with
the
amount
of
loss
on
it.
and
you
call
in
that
one
witness,
and
you
can
prove
up
your
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
if
you
have
a
case
of
telemarketing--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
it
would,
justice
stevens.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
that's
what,
what
i
want
to
contrast
it
is
with--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
imagine
that
you
have
a
telemarketing
fraud
where
a
thousand
peoples...
a
thousand
individuals
have
been
milked
out
of
a
couple
of
dollars
each.
now
under
the
current
system,
proving
up
the
fraud
amount
for
the
judge
is
not
that
difficult
because
you
can
get
the
probation
officer
to
testify,
or
some
other
way
to
get
the
total
amount
of
the
fraud
in
front
of
the
judge.
under
the
system
that
respondents
propose,
you're
going
to
have
to
call
in
every
one
of
2,000
individuals
who
was
defrauded.
otherwise,
i
think
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
to
prove
that
fraud
amount
in
front
of
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
that
just
is
one
example
of
the
disproportionate
and
disuniform
effects--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it
would
be
very--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
suppose--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
again,
i
think
whatever
else
is
true,
what
you
would
be
doing
with
such
a
system
is
you'd
be
taking
factors
that
i
think
everyone
concedes
were
designed
by
a
commission
that
was
upheld
as
constitutional
precisely
because
it
did
not
have
the
effect
of
creating
new
federal
crimes
and
statutory
limits.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
understand
that,
justice
scalia.
i'm
trying
to
talk
about
the
remedial
question,
though.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
we
don't
have
enough
experience
to
know.
i
think
i
can
tell
you
one
thing:
that
with
a
lot
of
enhancements,
putting
something
in
the
indictment
is
not
necessarily
the
difficult
step.
there
are
some
things
like
relevant
conduct
that
can
be
very
challenging
to
try
to
formulate
in
an
indictment.
but
for
a
lot
of
the
factors
that
enhance
a
sentence,
it's
relatively
easy
to
put
it
in
the
indictment
itself.
i
think
the
trickier
difficulties
come
up
in
terms
of
trying
to
instruct
the
jury,
especially
in
cases
where
there
are
multiple
enhancements.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
completely
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
those
cases
are
just
out.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
that's
never
been
the
under...
i
mean,
that's
true,
there
may
be
some
cases
that
you
could
bring
a
separate
perjury
prosecution,
but
this
court--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
there
may
be
situations
where
there's
an
obstruction
of
justice
that
wouldn't
necessarily
make
out
all
the
elements
of
a
perjury
prosecution.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
souter,
with
respect,
i
mean,
this
court,
both
before
the
guidelines
and
after
the
guidelines,
rejected
the
argument
that
the
only
way
to
enhance
a
sentence
for
obstruction
of
justice
was
to
bring
a
separate
perjury
prosecution.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
what
this
court
had
before
it
in
dunnigan.
and
this
court
said
that
that
was
not
problematic.
it
was
obstruction
during
the
trial.
and
this
court
upheld
it
on
reliance
on
grayson,
a
pre-guidelines
case,
and
this
court
said
that
the
additional
rigor
and
predictability
instilled
by
the
guidelines
did
not
make
a
constitutional
difference.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
a
fair
summary,
justice
breyer.
i
think
on
sort
of
how
complicated
it
gets
to
take
something
that
was
designed
for
a
judge
and
then
send
it
before
the
jury
in
jury
instructions,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
medas
case,
which
we
cite
on
page
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
assuming
i
understand
the
approach
you
propose,
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
taking
that
approach.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would...
i
would
take
the
approach
that
you
should
make
the
advisory...
the
advisory
guidelines...
the
guidelines
as
advisory.
now,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
you've
escaped
from
the
burden
of
serving
on
the
sentencing
commission,
i
don't
think
that
the
reading
of
3742,
the
appeal
provision,
that
you've
envisioned
is
necessarily
foreordained.
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--a
couple
of
observations,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
you're
exactly
right,
since
1812
we've
abandoned
a
system
where
judges
can
define
the
elements
of
crimes.
and
that's
why,
if
i
leave
you
with
one
thought
on
the
remedy,
i
would
think
that
it's
inappropriate
to
allow
an
entity
within
the
judicial
branch
to
have
that
effect
on
a
prospective
basis.
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
serious
separation
of
powers
problem.
i
think
it
would
dwarf
the
separation
of
powers
problem
that
at
least
you
found
quite
significant
in
the
mistretta
case.
now,
if
i
can
address
justice
kennedy's
question
about
the
appeals
system
simply
replicating
the
apprendi
or
the
blakely
problem.
first
of
all,
we
would
suggest
that
the
appeal
process
that
you've
envisioned
would
not
violate
apprendi
and
blakely.
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
think
the
commission
wouldn't
violate
blakely.
because
what
we
see
is
a
distinction
in
this
court's
cases.
they
have...
this
court
has
that
judicial
discretionary
sentencing
doesn't
implicate
the
sixth
amendment.
this
court
has
said
that
legislative-directed
sentencing
does
implicate
the
sixth
amendment.
what
the
guidelines
present
is
a
situation
of
judicial
sentencing
that's
directed.
we
would
suggest...
we
would
suggest--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
can
point
you
to
the
difrancesco
case,
where
this
court
approved
an
earlier
federal
statute
that
allowed
for
appeals
in
sentencing.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
our
position
would
be
that
that
kind
of
system
would
be
constitutional.
as
i
was
suggesting
to
justice
kennedy,
we
think,
because
that
system
would
be
constitutional,
we
think
the
guidelines
are
also
constitutional.
i
think
justice
kennedy
is
right,
though,
that
somebody
that
says
that
that
system
is
unconstitutional
and
the
guidelines
is
unconstitutional
is
not
going
to
be
particularly
impressed
by
that
reading
of
3742
that
gets
you
to
that
result.
and
that's
why
i
want
to
leave
you
with
an
important
thought,
which
is,
that
reading
of
3742
is
not
foreordained.
this
court
could
say
that
the
guidelines
should
be
applied
in
an
advisory
fashion,
and
that
all
that
would
be
left
of
the
government--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but,
justice
o'connor,
that's
why,
to
be
clear,
we've
only
argued
in
favor
of
an
advisory
view
of
the
guidelines
if
we
get
to
the
remedial
question,
because
i
think
you're
absolutely
right,
if
you
look
at
what
congress
actually
intended,
it's
crystal
clear
they
did
not
intend
the
guidelines
to
be
advisory.
but
it's
equally
crystal
clear
they
didn't
intend
the
guidelines
to
be
the
basis
for
jury
fact-finding.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that
actually
would
be
the
proper
remedy.
that's
effectively
what
we
ask
for,
mr.
chief
justice.
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
think
that's
fair,
justice
ginsburg.
i
mean,
in
responding
to
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
i
didn't
mean
that
was
the
only
way
to
get
to
the
result
we've
proposed.
and
the
particular
way,
in
our
brief,
that
we
suggest
that
you
would
get
to
an
advisory
use
of
the
guidelines
on
a
prospective
basis
is
precisely
as
you
suggest.
you
don't
read
3553(b)
to
change
"may"
to
"shall";
instead,
you
read
it,
unfortunately,
i
guess,
if
we've
reached
the
remedial
question,
to
be
unconstitutional.
and
then,
at
that
point,
you
focus
in
on
3553(a)--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely.
absolutely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly.
and
then
if
i
could
just--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
don't
see
how
it
works
in
3742(e),
because
if
you
read
that
section
in
context
it's
talking
about
determinations
made
by
the
court,
it's
talking
about
determinations
made
by
the
court
after
the
presentence
report
comes
in--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
so
i
think
that
3742(e)
has
to
go.
i
think
the
fairer--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
the
fairer
reading
of
3553(b)
is
that
it
has
to
go,
too.
i
know
that
you
don't
agree
with--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
you
disagree
with
me
on
that.
i
think
994...
99...
994(a),
in
title
28,
which
talks
about
the
guidelines
being
for
the
use
of
the
sentencing
court,
i
would
suggest
that
has
to
go,
but
i
assume
you
would
say
sentencing
court
can
mean
sentencing
judge.
then
at
that
point,
there's
a
provision
of
rule
32
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
must
go,
because
it
talks
about
the
role
of
the
district
court
in
a
way
that
i
don't
think
you
can,
sort
of,
find
to
mean
the
jury.
and
then
i
think,
obviously,
the
sentencing
guidelines
provision
that
makes
clear
that
it
is
the
judge
that's
to
make
the
findings
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
has
to
go,
as
well.
so
i
think
that
is...
that
is...
that
is
the
sum
total
of
the
carnage
of
deciding--
[laughter]
--that
the
guidelines
are
fully
applicable
with
blakely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
very,
very
many
of
them.
i
mean,
i
can't
give
you
a
better
answer
than
that,
in
terms
of
the
number.
but
the
medas
case,
on
page
of
a
reply
brief
that
i
suggested
the
court
look
at,
provides
one
example.
there,
you
had
a
case
where
it
had
already
gone
to
the,
to
the
jury
on
a
general
verdict,
and
it
had
the
typical
kind
of
general
verdict
form
that's
used.
a
six-count
indictment.
there
were
boxes,
guilty/non-guilty
for
each
of
the
six
crimes
in
the
indictment.
then
when
there
was
a
concern
that
blakely
might
require
jury
findings
on
all
the
various
enhancements,
the
government
tried
to
put
in
a
20-page
supplemental
special
verdict
that
tried
to
walk
through
the
various
factors
that
the
jury
would
try
to
find.
i
think
that
just,
in
miniature,
shows
you
the
kind
of
transformation
you're
talking
about.
you
go
from
a
12-line
general
verdict
form,
which
is
the
classic
kind
of
verdict
form
used
in
the
criminal
system,
to
20
pages
of
a
supplemental
special
verdict
form.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
think
if
you
look
at
that
supplemental
verdict
form,
and
you
look
at
the
guidelines,
there's
no
other
way
to
do
it.
and
i
think,
as
the
judge
in
that
case
said,
one
of
the
things
that
comes
up
in
virtually
every
guidelines
case
is
the
issue
of
relevant
conduct.
now,
that
is
a
very,
very
difficult
thing
to
try
to
instruct
the
jury
on.
the
application
notes
that
the
commission
itself
have
come
up
in
span
eight
and
a
half
pages
of
very
small,
single
spaced
text.
to
try
to
give
that
as
jury
instructions,
i
think,
would
leave
the
jury
completely
bewildered.
then,
you'd
also,
though,
even
if
you
could
get
past
the
instruction
problems,
the
effect
of
considering
relevant
conduct
is
going
to
have
a
transformative
effect
on
what
goes
before
the
jury,
because
relevant
conduct
asks
the
jury
not
to
focus
on
the
elements
of
the
specific
crime;
the
relevant
conduct
focuses
on
the
other
acts
of
that
individual
defendant
and,
if
there's
joint
criminal,
if
there's
a
joint
criminal
undertaking,
the
reasonably
foreseeable
events
of
acts
of
others
taken
in
furtherance
of
the
joint
undertaking.
now,
the
effect
of
using
that
guideline,
designed
for
judges,
and
sending
it
to
the
jury,
is
effectively
to
transform
many,
many
cases
from
individual
defendant
cases
to
scheme
cases
or
conspiracy
cases.
so
in
tallying
up
the
carnage
and
the
wreckage
of
applying
these
guidelines
designed
clearly
for
judge
fact-finding
and
willy...
nilly
sending
them
to
the
jury,
i
think
you
have
to
include
the
confusion
and
the
difficulty
of
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
with
respect
to
the
sentencing
reform
act
itself,
the
statute,
the
provision
that
we
think
needs
to
be
severed
is
3553(b).
then,
with
respect
to
the
guidelines,
i
think
our
view
on
the
guidelines--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
the
specific
reference
to
"shall"...
this
is
basically
the
"shall/may"
issue...
i
think
that
needs
to
be
severed.
i'm
not
quite
sure
whether
3553(b)
is
left
after
you
do
that,
but
that's...
that's
the
important
thing.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggests,
3553(a)
still
stands
alone
as
telling
the
court
that
it
should
consider
that.
and
i
think,
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
i
actually
think
the
language
in
3553(b)
was,
was
a
floor
amendment
that
was
added
later.
so
it
certainly
doesn't
pull
the
whole
statute
down
to
take
that
one
provision
out
of
the
statute.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
court
in
mistretta
expressed
its
understanding
that
the
commission
was
constitutional
because
it
would
pursue
traditional
judicial
tasks
related
to
sentencing,
and
it
would
not
get
involved
in
quintessentially
legislative
acts
of
setting
maximum
penalties,
or
defining
the
elements
of
the
crime.
now,
we
of
course,
think
that's
quite
relevant
for
the
sixth
amendment
issue
that's
raised
in
question
one;
but
even
if
you
disagree
with
us
on
that,
even
if
you
think
the
non-legislative
origins
of
the
guidelines
don't
matter
for
purposes
of
question
one,
surely
they
do
matter
for
purposes
of
the
severability
analysis
under
question
two.
because
if
one
takes
those
elements,
those
enhancement
factors
in
the
guidelines,
and
treats
them
like
true
elements
of
crimes
that
must
go
to
the
jury,
then
you
are
giving
this
non-legislative
body's
work
product
the
effect
of
federal
criminal
statutes,
and
that's
something
that
not
only
mistretta
suggests
is
problematic,
but
united
states
v.
hudson
in
18
suggests
is
problematic.
and
the
effect
is
really
breathtaking;
it
is
an
understatement
to
say
that
the
effect
of
that
judicial
remedial
decision
would
be
to
create
thousands
of
new
federal
crimes.
now,
let
me
talk
just
for
a
second
about
the
language
of
severability.
there's
been
some
questions
about
whether
what
we're
really
talking
about
is
severability.
first
of
all
you're
going
to
have
some
cases
where
there's
going
to
be
no
enhancing
factor
at
all.
and
in
those
cases
you
don't
need
to
talk
about
severability.
if
there's
no
sixth
amendment
issue
raised
in
a
case,
there's
no
reason
to
strike
anything
down
and
that
would
be
a
simple
matter
of
traditional
principles
of
third
party
standing
and
facial
challenges.
the
fact
that
you
might
have
a
constitutional
problem
in
this
case,
doesn't
mean
that
you
invalidate
the
guidelines
in
those
other
cases,
where
they
apply
without
problem.
the
real
question
becomes,
what
do
you
do
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
sixth
amendment
problem,
assuming
blakely
applies
to
the
guidelines?
at
that
point,
i
think
severability
is
the
right
way
to
talk
about
it.
one
way
of
dealing
with
the
case
at
the
point
you
recognize
there's
a
sixth
amendment
problem
in
this
case
is
to
say,
"well,
there's
nothing
we
can
do
about
it,
we
can't
sentence
this
individual
to
any
more
than
the
upper
bound
of
the
sentencing
range.
"
the
second
thing
you
can
do
is
you
can
say,
"well,
okay,
there's
a
constitutional
problem,
but
the
result
is
that
we
sever
3553(b),
we
don't
make
the
guidelines
mandatory,
and
we
allow
the
judge
to
impose
a
discretionary
sentence
within
the
range
of
the
statute.
"
that
is
what
we
think
is
the
appropriate
solution.
as
a
couple
of
you
have
mentioned,
what
we
may
be
talking
about
here
is
an
interim
solution
anyway
as
congress
may
well
get
involved.
that's
why
in
considering
what
regime
of
remediability
or
severability
best
serves
the
interests
of
congress
in
uniformity
and
proportionality,
it
pays
to
pay
particular
attention
to
the
cases
that
are
in
the
pipeline
now.
and
on
those
cases,
there's
no
question
which
proposal
better
serves
the
interest
of
uniformity
and
proportionality.
respondents
have
to
admit
that
they
are
seeking
a
huge
sentencing
windfall
here.
one
other
point
that
bears
mention
is
this
idea
of,
the
suggestion
that
because
the
guidelines
will
not
be
binding
in
every
case,
the
government
somehow
controls
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
a
guidelines
case
or
not.
that
is
not
the
case.
that
decision
under
the
system
will
rest
with
the
judge.
if
there
is
an
enhancement
sought,
but
it's
not
found
in
the
basis
of
the
judge,
then
there's
no
sixth
amendment
problem
in
that
case,
and
the
case
can
go
forward.
the
irony,
of
course,
is
that
the
consequence
of
applying
blakely
to
the
guidelines
is
to
create
more
power
with
the
prosecutor,
because
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
under
the
current
system
of
the
guidelines,
the
prosecutor
cannot
control
through
the
indictment
exactly
what
sentencing
factors
the
judge
will
consider.
the
burns
case,
for
example,
that
this
court
had
involved
a
case
in
where
the
judge
sua
sponte
took
notice
of
sentencing
factors
that
neither
the
prosecutor
nor
the
defendant
very
much
wanted
in
front
of
the
court.
that
will
no
longer
be
possible
under
a
system
where
everything
has
to
be
in
the
indictment,
so
the
result
is
to
strengthen
the
hand
of
the
government.
the
last
thing
is
this
idea
of
bifurcation
is
not
a
panacea.
i
know
justice
scalia,
you've
thrown
that
out
in
a
number
of
instances,
but
the
traditional
rule
in
cases
with
real
elements
of
real
federal
crimes
is
that
you
don't
get
to
bifurcate
out
one
element
that
the
defendant
doesn't
want
to
put
before
the
jury.
that's
the,
that's
the
binding
law
in
cases
like
collamore
out
of
the
first
circuit
and
barker
out
of
the
ninth
circuit.
so,
i
think
it's
wrong
to
suggest
that,
that
bifurcation
is
going
to
solve
all
these
problems.
