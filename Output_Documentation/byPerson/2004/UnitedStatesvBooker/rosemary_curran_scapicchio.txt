ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
as
to
question
one,
there's
no
meaningful
difference
between
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
and
the
washington
state
guidelines.
the
government
conceded
as
much
in
their
brief
to
this
court
in
blakely.
when
they
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
blakely
they
told
this
court,
or
they
urged
this
court
not
to
invalidate
the
washington
state
guidelines
because,
they
told
this
court,
if
you
do,
they
are
so
similar
to
the
federal
guidelines
that
the
federal
guidelines
will
fall
as
well.
and
here
they
are,
less
than
five
months
later,
standing
before
the
same
court,
saying
something
completely
different.
now,
it's
not
that
they're
so
similar
to
the
washington
state
guidelines,
but
that
they're
completely
different,
and
that
they
don't
operate
in
the
same
manner
at
all.
and
what
it
comes
down
to
is
that
for
sixth
amendment
purposes,
the
source
of
the
law
doesn't
matter.
the
government
got
it
right
when
they
filed
their
amicus
brief
in
blakely.
it
doesn't
matter
to
a
defendant
whether
or
not
the
source
of
the
law
is
legislative,
or
the
source
of
the
law
is
by
commission
or
regulatory
body.
if
the
sentence
is
going
to
increase,
based
on
a
fact
that,
that
the
law
makes
essential
to
punishment,
that
must
be
pled
and
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
if
there's
a
fact
necessary
to
increase
the
sentence--
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
--then
yes.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
with
respect
to
mr.
fanfan
in
this
case,
mr.
fanfan's
sentence
was
promulgated
based
on
the
jury
verdict
alone.
mr.
fanfan,
the
government
chose
to
indict
mr.
fanfan
on
a
single
count
of
conspiracy.
he
went
to
trial
on
a
single
count
of
conspiracy.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
conspiracy
to
distribute
500
grams
of
cocaine.
the
government
knew
at
the
time
of
trial
that
mr.
fanfan
was
arrested
with
281
grams
of
crack
cocaine
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
the
government
chose
not
to
indict
him
for
that
281
grams
of
crack
cocaine,
and
instead,
they
chose
to
prove
the
easiest
possibly
indictment
before
the
jury.
once
the
jury
was
dismissed
in
this
case,
the
government
then
sought
to
increase
mr.
fanfan's
sentence
by
157
months,
based
on
the
possession
of
the
crack
cocaine
that
they
knew
about
at
the
very
beginning,
and
we're
suggesting
that
judge
hornby
did
the
right
thing
in
limiting
mr.
fanfan's
sentence
to
that
which
was
supported
by
the
jury
verdict
alone
and
nothing
else.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
what
judge
hornby
did
for
mr.
fanfan
was,
he
conducted
what
he
called
a
presentence,
a
pre-blakely
hearing,
and
at
the
pre-blakely
hearing
he
allowed
the
prosecutor
to
present
evidence
relative
to
relevant
conduct
involved
in
the
offense.
and
the
prosecutor
presented
evidence
that
the
relevant
conduct
included
this
possession
of
281
grams
of
crack
cocaine,
as
well
as
a
case
agent
who
claimed
that
mr.
fanfan
was
the
leader
of
this
entire
conspiracy.
and
then
judge
hornby
went
on
to
say,
based
on
everything
that
he
heard
in
the
pre-blakely
hearing,
if
given
the
opportunity,
he
would
sentence
my
client
to
between
188
to
235
months.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
he
was
required.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
he
did.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
absolutely.
it
was
the
guidelines
required
him
to
impose
sentence
between
188
to
235
months.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
he,
what
judge
hornby
did
is,
is
he
sentenced
mr.
fanfan
based
solely
on
the
jury's
verdict.
the
jury
only
heard
evidence
of
the
conspiracy
to
distribute
500
grams
of
crack
cocaine.
because
the
jury
only
heard
evidence,
and
thus
returned
a
verdict
based
solely
on
the
500
grams
of
crack
cocaine,
then
mr.
fanfan's
sentence,
according
to
the
judge
hornby
after
this
court
decided
blakely,
was
limited
to
the
jury
verdict
alone.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
well,
in
this
particular
case
i
would
say
no,
because
the
government
knew
when
this
court
decided
apprendi,
and
certainly
knew
by
the
time
this
court
decided
ring,
that
if
they
wanted
to
increase
a
defendant's
sentence
beyond
the
statutory
max,
that
they
should
plead
it
and
prove
it
in
the
indictment.
and
in
this
case,
they
chose
not
to.
and
so,
whether
or
not
mr.
fanfan
may
have...
get
some
benefit
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
blakely,
certainly
he
does.
i'm
not
denying
that
he
doesn't.
but
only
because
the
government
didn't
do
what
this
court
told
them
they
should
do
in
both
apprendi
and
ring.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
he
did
not.
he
indicated
that,
if
the
guidelines
applied,
that
he
believed
mr.
fanfan
fell
between
188
and
235
months.
there
was
no
discussion
at
all
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
discretion
to
sentence
anywhere
outside
the
guidelines
during
this
proceeding.
and,
with
respect
to
question
two
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
the
guidelines
are
severable,
which
of
course
is
the
more
difficult
question
before
the
court,
our
proposal
to
sever
out
those
portions
of
the
guidelines
that
require
judicial
fact
finding
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
will
accomplish
the
sentencing
reform
goals.
the
goals
of
the
sentencing
reform
were
uniformity,
proportionality,
and
certainty.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
would
we
sever
the
portions
of
the
statute
that
require--
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
--we
would
leave
in
place
the
majority
of
the
sentencing
guidelines.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
mr.
chief
justice,
would
i
sever
out--
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
--yes.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
well,
i
think
you
sever
it
by
severing
out
the
unconstitutional
portions
of
it.
and
you
sever
it
by
getting
rid
of
anything
that
indicates
that
indicates
it's
a
judicial
fact
finding
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
well,
the
departures
in--
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
--the
applications
of
the
statute
that
are
invalid
in
this
case
are
the
ones
that
require
judicial
fact
finding
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
those
under
blakely
need
to
be
severed.
what
we're
left
with
now
is
a
statute
that
needs
to,
that
needs
to
function
in
terms
of
saving
the
guidelines.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
it's
not
going
to
operate
exactly
the
way
congress
intended.
because
congress
never
intended
to
pass
a
statute
that
was
unconstitutional.
and
so
it
has
to
undergo
some
change.
and
in
this
particular
case,
what
we're
saying
is,
minimize
the
amount
of
changes
that
the
statute
has
to
undergo
in
order
to
preserve
it.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
well,
congress
intended
a
mandatory
system.
it's
clear
that
congress
intended
a
mandatory
system.
the
government--
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
--not
necessarily
fact
finding
by
the
judiciary.
it's
not
one
of
the
listed
goals
of
the
sentencing
reform
act.
those
listed
goals
are
uniformity,
proportionality
and
certainty,
and
those
goals
can
still
be
met
under
the
proposal
that
we're
suggesting
the
court
adopt.
there
will
still
be
uniformity
in
sentencing,
there
will
still
be
proportionality
and
there
will
still
be
certainty
of
sentence.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
if
it
turns
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
is
some,
some
difference
in
the
severity
of
a
sentence
that
a
defendant
receives,
certainly
congress
could,
could
come
in
and
make
the
appropriate
changes
if
that's
the
result
of
the
proposal
that
we're
suggesting,
but
the
proportionality
wouldn't
change.
you
know,
the
degree
of
crimes
is
still
going
to
line
up
in
the
exact
same
manner.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
but...
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
true
any
time
congress
acts,
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
inseverability
of
the
statute.
we're
attempting
to
show
that
the
statute
is
severable
to
save
the
guidelines
in
this
case,
and
we're
attempting
to
show
that
by
suggesting
to
the
court
that
you
don't
have
to
throw
out
twenty
years
of
sentencing
reform.
that
the
guidelines
should
still
be
mandatory;
we're
suggesting
that
the
mandatory
portions
of
the
guidelines
remain,
the
bulk
of
the
guidelines
remain,
and
we're
changing
the
fact
finder.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
that's
certainly
an
option
that
the
court
could
consider.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
i,
well,
i
think
because
what's
left
is,
is
that
the
system
will
then
be
open
to
some
manipulation,
under
that
scenario.
if
the
government
can
control
who
it
is
that
will
be
sentenced
under
the
guidelines
and
who
will
not
be
sentenced
under
the
guidelines,
then
the
system
is,
is
ripe
for
manipulation.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
in,
under
that
scenario,
if
any
fact
that
needed
to
increase
a
defendant's
sentence
was
pled
and
proved
to
a
jury,
that
would
suffice.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
absolutely
not.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
it
produces
the
same
results,
whether
it's,
you
call
it
severance
or
the
way
that
the
statute
works.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
it's
very
likely
to
be
interim
solution
and
the
legislature
will
tell
us
what
they
really
want
us
to
do
and
we'll
all
make
the
appropriate
adjustments.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
most
cases
are
plea
bargained.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
yes.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
the--
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
--yes,
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
because
that's
exactly
the
way
that
the
guidelines
operate
now.
the
only
thing
that's
changing
is
the
identity
of
the
fact
finder.
that
the
government
can
come
in
now
and
charge
whatever
it
wants,
because
it's
free
to
charge
whatever
it
wants,
and
that,
the
government
in
this
case,
or
in
any
case,
could
then
bargain
with
defense
counsel
and
the
defendant
as
to
which
facts
they
may
want
to
plead
to,
as
to
which
portions
of
the
indictment
they
may
want
to
plead
to,
happens
every
day.
and,
and,
and
so,
if
that's
the
case,
changing
the
identity
of
the
fact
finder
isn't
going
to
change
that
process
at
all.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
before
quite...
before
this
court's
decision
in
apprendi?
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
i
don't
believe
so.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
and
with
respect
to
mr.
fanfan
in
this
case,
your
honors,
we're
asking
that
this
court
give
intelligible
content
to
the
jury's
verdict
by
finding
the
district
court's
imposition
of
a
78-month
sentence
based
solely
on
the
facts
found
by
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
within
the
guideline
range?
yeah.
ms.
rosemary
curran
scapicchio
substantial
discretion
within
the
range,
yes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
