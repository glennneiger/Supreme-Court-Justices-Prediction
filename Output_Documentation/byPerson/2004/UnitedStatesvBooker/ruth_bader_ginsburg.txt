justice
ruth
bader

can
we
just
go
back
to
the
point
you
just
made,
it's
a
little
different
when
the
judge
has
discretion
and
there's
no...
the
judge
has
discretion
to
take
a
whole
bunch
of
things
into
account,
but
they're
not
quantified.
and
i
think
that
was
dramatically
illustrated,
the
difference,
by
the
decision
of
judge
lynch
when
he
said,
"well,
i'll
go
back
to
the
old
ways
of
doing
it,
i'll
look
at
the
guidelines
for
some
advice.
"
he
comes
out
with
twenty-four
months
instead
of
thirty-three
months.
so
i
think
there
is
a
huge
difference
between
a
judge
taking
account
of
many,
many
factors,
not
giving
them
a
specific
quantity
as
the
guidelines
require.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
determination,
as
is
occasionally
true
of
the
guidelines,
is
made
not
by
the
commission,
but
by
congress
itself?
or
made
by
the
commission
at
the
direction
of
congress?
then
the
distinction
that
you're
making
between
the
maximum
set
by
the
legislature
and
the
guidance
provided,
or
the
guidance
to
discretion
under
the
guidelines,
really
doesn't
stand
up.
so
at
least
to
the
extent
that
congress
directly
enacts
guidelines,
would
you
concede
that
then,
the
critical
finding
has
to
be
made
by
the
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
complexity,
is
the
key
or,
suppose
these
guidelines
were
proposed
by
the
commission,
just
as
they
are,
with
all
their
complexity,
but
they
were
proposed
as
legislation,
and
then
congress
enacted
these
guidelines,
would
you
be
able
to
make
the
argument
that
you're
making,
still?
the
federal
system,
now
legislative
guidelines
is
viable
after
blakely?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
so
clear
anymore,
it
just
happens
that
there
are
three
members,
but
they
don't
have
to
be
any
judicial
members,
under
the
current
legislation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--about
practice
experience
in
that
regard.
i
understand
the
department
of
justice
has
told
prosecutors
that
now
you
allege
these
sentencing
enhancers...
like
drug
quantity,
like
amount
of
property
stolen...
you
allege
them
in
the
indictment,
you
prove
them
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
has
that
proved
intractably
difficult
in
cases
where
it
has
been
attempted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
it
were
done
that
way,
why
would
it
be
that
you
would
try
to
change
the
word
(b)?
why
not
just
have
section
3553(a),
which
does
list
the
guidelines
as
one
of
the
considerations
that
judges
may
take
into
account
in
sentencing,
one
of...
among
three
or
four
others?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
has
the
guidelines--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
one
of
other
factors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
hope
you
will
go
over
to
the...
to
the
severability
problem,
because,
as
i
understood
it,
you
and
the
government
were
very
much
at
odds
about
what
should
be
severed
and
what
shouldn't,
and
we
didn't
get
to
ask
mr.
clement
about
his
severance,
which
was
going
to
be
that
to
the
extent
no
plus
factors
are
involved,
no
sentence-enhancing
factors
are
involved,
the
guidelines
remain
binding.
he
didn't
get
a
chance
to
say
that
in
his
argument,
and
i
hope
he'll
address
it.
and
you
say,
"whatever
you
do,
don't
make
it
half
binding
and
half
advisory.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
would
it
be
so
terrible
to
say,
"well,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
no
sentencing
enhancing
factors,
let's
preserve
what
congress
did,
let's
make
them
binding
when
the
jury
doesn't
have
to
find
anything?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
what
about
all
the
factors...
justice
breyer
outlined
four
categories
of,
of
guideline
factors
that
are
not
easily,
if
at
all,
presented
to
the
jury.
the
chief
justice
mentioned
the
one
of
perjury
at
the
trial
itself.
could
never
give
that
to
a
jury
because
it
hasn't
happened
until
the
trial.
and
some
of
the
others
that
become
very
complicated,
like
he
mentioned,
other...
other
relevant
conduct,
relevant
conduct,
yeah.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
would
just
be
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
have
to
be
prosecuted
as
separate--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
a
special
verdict
wouldn't
do
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
defendant,
i
think
would
resist
it
very
heavily,
if
what
the
findings
have
to
be
are,
say,
a
much
larger
drug
quantity,
the
relevant
conduct.
these
are
things
that
could
be
damning
for
a
defendant.
so
a
defendant
surely
would
not
want
that,
all
of
this
to
be
tried
to
the
jury
that's
going
to
try
the
basic
case.
the
defendant
would
much
prefer
to
have
the
jury
not
know
about
that
it
wasn't
five
ounces,
that
it
was
500
grams,
or
that,
at
the
same
time,
the
defendant
did
a
lot
of
other
bad
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
would
have
to
have,
then,
essentially
two
trials.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
what
the
kansas
system
is?
i
mean,
right
after
apprendi,
they
transformed
their
guideline
system
into
one
where
the
jury
makes
the
findings,
but
are
all
of
their
trials
bifurcated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
judge
hornby
had
some
distress
in
doing
that,
didn't
he,
because
the
difference
was
quite
large?
based
on
what
the
judge
found,
it
would
have
been
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
as
opposed
to
five
or
six
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
didn't
say
it,
that
that
was
his
discretionary
choice.
he
said
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--he
made,
he
made
those
findings
of
fact,
that...
leadership
role
and
the
quantity
of
drugs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
on
the
basis
of
those
two
he
said
the
guidelines
would
require
me
to
come
up
with
this
higher
sentence,
not
that
using
the
guidelines
as
advisory
he
would
have
gotten--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
then
the
other,
that's
the
high
range,
and
the
low
range
is,
i'll
just
stick
with
the
crime
that
he
was
indicted
for,
and
that's
five
or
six
years.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
quite
a
windfall
for
mr.
fanfan,
isn't
it?
