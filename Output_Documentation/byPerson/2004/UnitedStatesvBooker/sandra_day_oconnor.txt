that
just
seems
so
contrary
to
what
congress
intended.
there's
no
evidence
that
they
intended
this
scheme
to
be
advisory.
they
told
the
commission
to
set
up
a
scheme
that
would
be
applied,
because
they
wanted
to
make
sentencing
more
uniformly
applied
in
the
federal
scheme
of
things.
i
think
it's
a
real
stretch
to
try
to
argue
for
the
position
taken
by
some
federal
judges
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that,
"it's
just
advisory,
don't
worry.
"
and
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
understand
how
appellate
review
could
be
applied
to
such
a
scheme.
justice

well,
maybe
we
should
just
leave
it
to
congress
to
decide,
because
it
doesn't
sound
like
the
scheme
congress
intended.
justice
sandra

and
it
intended
fact
finding
by
a
preponderance
for
both
upward
adjustments
and
downward.
