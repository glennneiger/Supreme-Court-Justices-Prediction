justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
listed
four
categories
of
things
that
you
think
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove
to
a
jury
at
the
trial,
but
not
to
a
judge
at
sentencing.
the
first
is
the
vast
amount
of
information
now
and
prior
to
guidelines
that
were
contained
in
the
presentence
report.
that
information,
most
of
which
was
used
since
history
was
begun,
maybe
a
hundred
years
ago,
is
simply
not
available
until
the
trial
was
over.
the
second
happens
to
be
the
things
that
the
chief
brought
up,
matters
committed
at
trial,
such
as
perjury.
the
third
sort
of
thing
are
those
things
that
just
get
too
complicated
when
you
try
to
list
in
indictment,
such
as
victim...
put
them
all
together...
victim,
brandishing
the
gun,
et
cetera.
and
the
fourth
kind
of
thing
are
the
things
that
are
too
difficult
to
explain
to
a
jury.
try
explaining
even
"brandishing"
to
a
jury,
and
if
you
can
do
that
one,
which
may
be
easy,
try
the
multiple-count
rules.
all
right.
so
i
have
those
four
things.
now,
are
there
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
all
right
if
i
believe
that
that
is
just
out
of
the
question,
it's
so
complicated,
nobody
could
do
it,
it
would
be
a
radical
change,
congress
could
never
have
intended
that,
what
about
a
much
simpler
approach?
what
you
would
do
is
take
3553(b),
and
you
say,
"read
the
word
i.e.
"shall
apply
the
guidelines"...
to
"may",.
"
so
that
the
guidelines
become
advisory,
either
because
the
"shall"
becomes
a
"may"
or
because
you
give
each
judge
the
power
to
give
any
reasonable
reason
at
all
as
to
why
the
commission's
guideline,
they
didn't
actively
consider
this
factor.
in
other
words,
read
3553(b)
as
permissive.
and
now,
assuming
i've
expressed
myself
on
the
underlying
apprendi
questions,
so
i,
but
suppose
blakely
does
apply,
would
you...
is...
what
would
be
wrong
with
taking
that
approach?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
i
have
thought
of
one
thing
that
might
be
wrong.
[laughter]
so
i'll
ask
you
about
it,
if
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
well,
i...
you
see
nothing
wrong
with
that.
that
makes
the
guidelines
advisory,
and
there
are
a
number
of
objections...
maybe
not,
maybe
big,
maybe
small.
one
objection
i
was
worried
about
is...
i'm
giving
you
my
thought
process,
you
know,
and
i...
because
i'm
trying
to
get
a...
your
response...
is
that
if
we
did
take
that
approach,
you'd
leave
the
appellate
section
in
place.
that
means
every
time
the
judge
didn't
use
the
guideline,
the
appeals
courts
would
have
to
review
for
reasonableness.
now
that
would
be
in
place.
we
would
discover
judges
all
over
the
country
having
different
views
on
that.
courts
of
appeals
would
have
different
views
about
was
or
what
was
not
reasonable.
we
would
be
here
to
review
those
differences,
and
we
would
become
the
sentencing
commission.
i
thought
i
had
escaped.
[laughter]
now,
how,
how
serious
an
objection
is
that?
or
do
you
recommend
that,
if
you
lose
on
this
point,
we
take
the
approach
of,
in
that
way,
making
the
guidelines
advisory?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
are
lots.
there
are
lots,
actually.
if
you...
if...
i
ask,
"is
it
right,
that"?
[laughter]
but,
i
mean,
if
you
take
common
law
to
mean
england,
as
well
as
the
united
states,
there
weren't
here,
because
the
sentences
weren't
appealable,
but
in
england,
they
were
appealable,
and
they
had
a
common
law
work
out
of
what
they
called
the
"tariff",
which
is
what
the
range
of
reasonableness
was
or
wasn't.
and
the
prosecution,
i
believe,
could
appeal
it
of
being
too
low;
and
the
defense,
being
too
high.
and
the
question
was,
was
the
sentence
reasonable?
the
appellate
court
could
set
it.
now,
if
we
had
a
system
like
that...
and
this
is
my
serious
question...
is
it
unconstitutional
under
apprendi
if
appeals
court
judges
reviewing
a
sentence
could
say,
"this
is
the
range
of
reason,
this
is
arbitrary
up
here,
or
this
is
arbitrary
down
there?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
the
judge
had
simply
sentenced
the
defendant,
let's
say,
to
ten
years,
but
looked
at
these
other
crimes
and
said,
"in
my
practice,
i
go
to
15.
"
all
right?
that's
the
basic
situation.
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
there
are
no
guidelines.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
suppose
the
people
who
do
exactly
the
same
thing
is
the
court
of
appeals
applying
the
word
"reasonable",
these
officials
of
the
judicial
branch.
see,
they're
reviewing
the
sentence
for
reasonableness.
they
say,
"in
our
practice
when
a
person
commits
bank
robbery,
if
just
an
ordinary
case,
we
think
it's
reasonable
five
years;
but
if
he
has
a
gun,
seven
years.
"
so
if
there's
no
gun,
five
years
is
the
most
that
isn't
arbitrary.
but
if
there's
a
gun,
you
can
go
to
seven
years.
in
other
words,
an
english-type
tariff
system.
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
it
would
be.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now
suppose
the
people
who
do
it
are
the
parole
commission...
as
happen
to
be
in
the
united
states,
executive
branch
officials.
for
the
last
hundred
years,
they
get
sentences,
for
example,
that
were
indeterminate,
or
might
have
been
for
30
years.
and
what
they
say,
"it
is
our
practice,
assuming
good
behavior,
that
if
it
was
just
an
ordinary
bank
robbery
we'll
keep
him
in
for
five
years,
but
if
he
had
a
gun,
he's
going
to
stay
in
for
seven.
"
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
what
they
have
is
an
indeterminate
sentence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
california.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
they
say
is,
"in
our
practice,
what
we
do
is,
we
think
it's
reasonable,
and
we
will
keep
a
person
in
prison
for
five
years
in
an
ordinary
bank
robbery,
but
for
seven
years
if
he
has
a
gun.
"
i'm
asking
if
that's
constitutional.
because
that's
the
practice
that
they
follow
under
parole
commission
guidelines,
and
they've
done
it
now
for
a
decade,
i
make
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
constitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
trying
to
drive
at...
and
i'll
be...
is
that
i
can't
imagine
a
court
holding
that
a
parole
commission
in
the
executive
branch
that
has
exactly
this
same
system
would
be
behaving
unconstitutionally.
it's
difficult
for
me
to
imagine...
though
you
say
i'm
wrong
on
that...
a
court
holding
it's
unconstitutional
when
a
court
of
appeals
does
the
same
thing
reviewing
for
arbitrariness.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
not
raising
the
question
well.
i'm
trying
to
imagine
sentencing
guidelines
run
by
a
parole
commission,
executive
branch
officials.
i'm
trying
to
imagine
sentencing
guidelines
run
under
the
word
arbitrary
by
ordinary
courts
of
appeals
panels
reviewing
the
sentences.
and
if
those
are
both
constitutional,
then,
i
would
ask,
why
is
it
unconstitutional
to
put
the
executive
branch
and
judicial
branch
officials
together
in
one
group
called
the
sentencing
commission?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that.
and...
well,
maybe
i'm
just
not
going
to
get
my
question
across.
i
am
trying
to
imagine
apprendi.
would
apprendi
apply
to
parole
commission
guidelines?
i
should
think
the
answer,
unless
we're
going
to
reverse
a
hundred
years
of
history,
is
no.
would
apprendi
apply
to
a
court
of
appeals
panel
with
the
power
to
review
sentences
for
arbitrariness?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
think
the
answer
is
no.
and,
therefore,
i
wonder
why
it
applies
if
we
take
judicial
officials
and
executive
branch
officials,
and
they
do
exactly
the
same
thing
under
the
heading
sentencing
commission.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look,
we're
trying
to
go
to
the
same
point,
and
i
think
you're
actually
given
me
a
pretty
good
answer.
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
imagining
my
system
being
the
system
that
apprendi
forbids.
so
i'm
not
doing
increase/decreases.
i'll
think
of
the
very
kind
of
system.
and
i
take
it
your
answer
is
this...
and
remember,
i
dissented
in
apprendi.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
agree
with
it.
right.
but
there
we
are.
and
so
i'm
trying
to
see
how
far
it
goes.
so
i
wonder,
we
take
our
apprendi
system
and
now
it's
being
administered
by
a
parole
commission.
we
take
our
apprendi
system,
and
now
it's
being
administered
by
a
court
of
appeals
using
the
legal
standard
arbitrariness.
and
i
take
it
your
answer
is
those
are
just
as
unconstitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
you
understand
what
i'm
doing,
because
i'm
saying
you
either
have
to
follow
the
force
of
your
logic
and
make
those
unconstitutional,
too,
or
you
have
to
say
there's
a
difference.
and,
by
definition,
the
only
difference
is
who
promulgated
it.
and
then,
of
course,
i'm
going
to
ask
you,
if
there's
a
difference
right
there,
why
doesn't
this
one,
which
is
executive
plus
judicial,
fall
on
my
side
of
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i...
in
my
imaginary
parole
commission--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
i
will
argue
a
different
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
will
argue
it
another
time.
i've
seen
a
lot
of
parole
commission
guidelines,
and
i
would
say
they,
a
lot
of
them
did
fall
within
the
apprendi
boundaries.
but
if
we
did
take
it
and
have
the
parole
commission
do
it...
"it",
being
the
apprendi
forbidden
system,
in
your
view,
is
it
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
same
thing
is
true
of
a...
of
a
court
of
appeals
panel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
exist
under
the
guidelines?
how
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
only,
only,
only
if
you
have
statutes
that
have
mandatory
minimums
that
have
lesser
sentences.
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
compared
to
the
status
quo,
if
you
have
the
guidelines
alone,
one
of
their
basic
objectives
was
to
prevent
that
kind
of
manipulation.
and,
by
and
large,
i
thought
they
had
succeeded
on
that
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
lawful
under
the
guideline?
is
the
judge
required
to
accept
the
facts
as
the...
as
the
prosecution
and
defense
agree
to
present
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question?
and
i'd
appreciate
your
focusing
on
what
i
thought
were
the
two
most
important
ones,
which
is,
first,
the...
i
thought
that
sentencing
for
a
hundred
years
had
gone
on
primarily
on
the
basis
of
the
presentence
report.
and
the
idea
was,
the
person
is
convicted
and
now
we're
going
to
decide
what
to
do
with
this
individual
who's
convicted,
and
we're
going
to
read
what
the
probation
officer
writes
about
it,
and
he'll
go
interview
people
after,
as
he
does.
and
many,
many,
many,
if
not
most,
of
the
facts
in
that
presentence
report
were
not
available
at
the
time
of
trial.
they're
about
the
history
of
the
individual,
and
they're
more
about
the
manner
in
which
the
crime
was
carried
out.
and
the
other
main
thing
is
the...
is
the
vast
number
of
really
complex
operations,
multiple-count
rules,
relevant
conduct,
all
kinds
of
things
that...
try
even
"brandishing".
i
mean,
that's
the
second
thing,
the
complexity.
so
the
presentence
report--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
complexity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
congress's
basic...
that's
a
good
answer.
congress's
basic
objective
here
is...
was
uniformity.
i
think
it
was
a
noble
objective,
whether
or
not
it's
been
achieved
or,
but
are
you
saying
to
congress,
sorry,
the
constitution
prohibits
you,
in
congress,
from
trying
to
create
uniformity,
or
greater
uniformity,
of
sentencing
among
district
judges?
there's
just
no
way
you
can
do
it,
because
if
you
throw
everything
to
a
jury,
you
know,
you
throw
it
right
into
the
hands
of
the
prosecutor
to
determine
what
to
charge,
what
not
to
charge,
what
facts
to
agree
upon,
et
cetera,
no
way
to
do
it?
we're
back
to
our
two
cellmates...
one
day
served,
50
years
served...
though
the
real
conduct
was
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
long
as
you're
on
the
subject,
i'm
quite...
you're
going
to...
what
is
your
reaction
to
what
i've
written,
which
you've,
you
used
to
say
wrong,
wrong,
wrong,
but
i
want
to
know
why.
and
what
i
know
why
in
particular
is
i
speculated
somewhat,
that
the
reason
that
this
might
work,
your
side
of
it,
if
it
works
despite
the,
the
complication,
the
bifurcated
trials,
etc.
,
is
that
97
percent
of
the
cases
are
handled
through
plea
bargaining,
and
this
will
give
you
a
little
bit
of
a
leg
up,
which
i
speculated
the
defense
bar
likes.
i'm
not
surprised.
but
then,
i
thought
with
in
the
long
run,
you
just
can't
have
a
system
of
justice
that
depends
for
its
workable
nature
upon
plea
bargaining,
which
in
fact
depends
on
the
weapons
you
give
to
prosecutors.
and
so
i
ended
up
thinking,
i
just
can't
underwrite
such
a
thing.
and
i'd
like
to
get
your,
your,
your
reaction
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
can
i
ask
you
the
same
question?
imagine
that
the
statute
says
bank
robbery
is
zero
to
twenty
years.
case
one,
a
separate
statute
says
a
guideline
commission
will
make
distinctions,
and
the
guideline
commission
says,
"five
years
in
the
ordinary
case,
seven
years
with
a
gun.
"
case
two,
the
same
thing
but
a
parole
commission
does
it.
case
three,
the
same
thing,
but
a
court
of
appeals
panel
does
it,
under
the
guise
of
what's
arbitrary,
what
isn't.
they're
all,
in
your
opinion,
to
be
treated
alike.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
is
just
what
i
said,
just
what
i
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
idea
is
that
this
works
because
most
cases
are
plea
bargained.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
you'll
do
if
you're
right,
is
all
you
would
say
is
any
time
that
the
prosecutor
wants
to
say
that
you
committed
the
bank
robbery
or
you
committed
the
drug
offense
with
more
than
a
minimal
amount
of
money
or
more
than
a
minimal
amount
of
drug,
or
there
were
guns,
they
get
into
a
bargain,
and
they
end
up
with
a
sentence
once
they
bargain...
if
that's
the
sentence,
because
they're
not
even
going
to
contest
it
before
the
judge,
both
sides
will
come
in
and
agree.
but
in
those
few
cases
where
they
do
contest
it,
you
would
have
to
have
the
jury
find
the
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
the
only
reason
that
i
find
it
disturbing
is
to
think
that
congress
could
have
wanted
such
a
system
is
given
other
developments
in
congress,
mandatory
minimums
and
all
kinds
of
things,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
system
that
would
really,
might
make
non-uniformity
in
reality,
worse
than
it
was
before
1986.
see,
i
mean,
my
goodness,
every
prosecutor's
going
to
be
doing
something
different,
every
defense
attorney;
everything
will
depend
upon
the
bargains.
the
judges
when
they
come
in
will
think
different
things.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--should
we
uphold
something
like
that
in
the
face
of
a
congress
that
wanted
uniformity?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
find
out
anything
in
your
research
on
this
where
anybody
in
the...
this
discussion
of
the
guidelines
began,
i
think,
in
the
early
70's,
it's
been
around
for
30
years.
the
guidelines
have
been
law
for
17
years,
and
until
recently
with
apprendi,
is
there
a
history
of
anything
being
written
about
the
guidelines
being
unconstitutional
for
this
sixth
amendment
reason?
did
any
group
of
judges,
or
defense
attorneys,
or
academics
or
anybody
write
anything
that
we
could
look
at
until
quite
recently
in
which
they
thought
this
was
a
possibility?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
before
we
began
with
apprendi?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
reasonable
views.
the
second
question,
the
question
before
us
concerns
the
remedy
as
justice
stevens
just
said.
now,
the
conclusion
of
the
court
is
that
we
have
to
excise
or
invalidate
two
provisions
of
the
sentencing
act
of
1984
because
in
our
view,
those
two
provisions
are
inconsistent
with
today's
constitutional
decisions.
one
of
the
provisions
is
the
provision
that
makes
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
mandatory.
the
other
provision
sets
forth
certain
related
standards
for
appellate
review.
the
effect
of
our
excision
is
that
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
systems
will
remain
in
existence
unless
congress
changes
it,
it
will
remain
in
existence
but
not
as
a
mandatory
system;
it
will
remain
as
an
advisory
system.
moreover,
appellate
review
will
take
place
but
under
a
standard
of
reasonableness,
a
standard
that
the
remainder
of
the
act
and
its
history
indicate
is
appropriate.
now
first,
in
our
view,
the
proper
remedial
question
focuses
upon
congress'
intent.
given
the
incompatibility
between
today's
decision
and
the
act
as
written,
we
must
ask
which
remedy
is
more
consistent
with
the
sentencing
system
that
congress
tried
to
create
in
the
1984
act.
a
-
the
dissent's
remedy
which,
reinterprets
the
act's
fact
finding
provisions
and
essentially
then
patches
the
constitutional
requirement
onto
the
statute
as
it
was
originally
written;
or
b
-
excising
those
provisions
of
the
sentencing
act
would
give
rise
to
the
constitutional
problem.
we
decide,
as
i
suggested
in
favor
of
the
latter
remedy
excision
and
we
do
so
based
on
the
act's
language,
history
and
basic
purposes.
second,
although
reasonable
minds
can
differ,
a
majority
of
the
court
concludes
a
i
just
said
that
congress
would
have
preferred
invalidation
of
some
or
even
all
of
the
act
to
the
dissentor's
patched
on
system.
we
reach
this
conclusion
because
of
the
act's
language,
the
procedural
complexity
that
would
accompany
a
patched
on
system.
certain
anomalies
that
would
then
arise
depending
upon
whether
higher
or
lower
sentences
were
at
issue
and
above
all
because
we
believe
that
a
patched
on
system
would
in
fact
destroy
congress'
sentencing
reform
efforts.
it
would
produce
a
statute
that
would
have
moved
sentencing
away
from
not
towards
congress'
basis
statutory
objective
greater
uniformity
in
sentencing.
this
point
is
critical.
the
uniformity
that
congress
wought
in
the
act
is
not
uniformity
of
similar
sentences
for
those
convicted
of
similar
statutory
crimes.
it
did
not
say
seek
simply
the
same
sentence
for
everyone
convicted
of
extortion.
that
kind
of
uniformity
is
consistent
with
the
dissentor's
approach.
but
what
congress
wanted
was
a
different
kind
of
uniformity
namely
similar
sentences
for
those
engaged
in
similar
conduct,
i.e.
similar
sentences
for
those
offenders
who
committed
for
example
the
crime
of
extortion
in
similar
ways.
now,
an
example
may
help.
consider
two
former
felons
say
johnson
and
jackson
each
of
whom
engages
in
identical
criminal
behavior,
say,
they
threatened
a
bank
teller
with
a
gun,
they
take
$50,000.00,
and
they
injure
an
innocent
bystander
while
fleeing
the
bank.
suppose
prosecutors
were
to
charge
johnson
with
one
crime,
illegal
gun
possession
and
jackson
with
another
crime,
bank
robbery.
before
the
guidelines,
i.e.
before
1987,
a
judge
after
conviction
would
read
about
the
offender's
real
conduct
in
a
postconviction
pre-sentence
report.
that
judge
would
then
realize
that
the
conduct
of
the
two
offenders
was
identical
and
that
judge
likely
even
before
the
guidelines
would
have
imposed
similar
sentences
upon
the
two
offenders.
the
guidelines
which
came
along
in
1987
in
effect
told
different
judges
to
do
just
that
same
thing.
but
under
the
dissentor's
system,
the
judge
could
not
do
it
unless
the
prosecutor's
charge
extra
facts,
a
matter
that
is
up
to
them,
not
up
to
the
judge,
the
judge
could
not
impose
similar
sentences
because
the
jury
would
not
have
made
the
necessary
factual
findings.
in
that
way,
under
the
dissentor's
system,
the
prosecutor,
not
the
judge
would
control
the
sentence.
in
the
opinion
we
filed
today,
we
elaborate
these
points.
the
upshot,
in
our
view,
is
serious
incompatibility
between
the
sentencing
act's
most
basic
objective
and
today's
constitutional
requirement,
and
while
the
constitutional
requirement
must
prevail,
the
incompatibility
shows
that
given
that
requirement,
congress,
if
it
had
been
aware
that
it
could
not
have
had
the
mandatory
sentencing
system
that
it
wanted
and
that
it
wrote
into
the
act,
would
not
have
wanted
a
patched
on
system
instead,
rather
it
would
likely
have
preferred
a
modified
system
or
no
new
system
at
all.
third,
we
need
not
excise
every
sentencing
act
provision.
many
for
example,
some
provide
for
restitution
or
supervised
release
or
forfeiture
and
these
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter,
and
there
was
no
reason
to
invalidate
them.
in
deciding
what
to
invalidate
and
excise
and
what
not
to
invalidate,
we
must
ask
whether
after
excising
the
provisions
that
are
clearly
incompatible
with
the
constitutional
requirement,
are
the
remaining
provisions
constitutionally
valid,
capable
for
functioning
independently
and
consistent
with
congress'
basic
objectives
in
enacting
the
statute.
after
excising
the
two
provisions
mentioned,
the
provision
making
the
guidelines
mandatory,
and
the
provision
providing
related
standards
for
appellate
review,
the
remaining
statute
satisfies
these
requirements.
the
remaining
statutes
still
require
sentencing
judges
to
consider
the
sentencing
guidelines,
a
requirement
that
is
contained
in
a
section
called
3553(a),
it
remains,
but
i
have
to
consider
it
along
with
other
sentencing
criteria
as
well.
for
these
reasons
and
for
others
set
forth
in
our
opinion,
we
find
that
excision
of
two
provisions
necessary
and
consistent
with
congressional
intent.
as
we
said
at
the
outset,
doing
so
leaves
in
place
as
i
said
an
advisory
guideline
system
in
which
appellate
courts
will
review
sentence
for
their
reasonableness.
congress,
of
course,
many
now
make
such
changes
compatible
with
the
constitution
as
congress
believes
appropriate.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
united
states
v.
booker
and
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
united
states
v.
fanfan.
we
remand
the
cases
for
further
proceedings.
as
justice
stevens
said,
he
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
souter
joins
and
in
which
justice
scalia
joins
except
for
part
three
and
footnote
17;
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
in

justice
thomas
