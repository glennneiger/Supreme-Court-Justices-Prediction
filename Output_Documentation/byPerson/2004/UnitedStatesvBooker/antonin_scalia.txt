justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
we
found
no
serious
sixth
amendment
issue
raised.
was
the
right
of
jury
trial
issue
argued
in
that
case,
and
decided?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
right
to
jury
trial
is
fairly
clear
and
stark,
and
i
guess
don't
recall
that
being
argued
in
any
of
those
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement,
here's
the
problem
i
have
with
the
government's
argument
insofar
as
it
does
not
urge
that
we
reverse
blakely,
i
know
that
you
want
us
to
do
that
as
well.
but
assuming
we
adhere
to
blakely,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
cure
that
doesn't
correspond
to
the
disease.
you
say
that
the
reason
the
right
to
jury
trial
does
not
apply
here
is
because,
after
all,
these
sentences
have
not
been
prescribed,
or
these
maximums
have
not
been
prescribed
by
the
legislature,
but
rather,
have
been
prescribed
by
a
quasi-judicial
agency.
but
the
right
of
jury
trial
is
meant
to
protect
against
whom?
who
are
you
worried
about
when
you
say,
"i
want
to
be
tried
by
a
jury.
"
you're
not
worried
about
the
legislature,
you're
worried
about
the
judges,
precisely.
so
i
don't
care
if
the
upper
level
of
the
guidelines
were
actually
prescribed
by
a
court,
as
opposed
to
the
commission
which
is,
i
don't
know
what
it
is,
but
it's
not
a
court.
but
even
if
it
were
prescribed
by
a
court,
how
would
that
eliminate
the
jury
trial
problem?
the
whole
reason
for
jury
trial
is
we
don't
trust
judges.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
we're
talking
here
about
one
precise
role
of
the
judge
or
of
the
jury,
and
that
is,
to
find
a
fact
that
is
necessary
to
keep
you
in
jail
for
an
additional
number
of
years.
and
the
difference
with
discretionary
sentencing
is
if
it's,
you
know,
ten
to
twenty
years,
what
you
know
when
you
do
the
crime
is
that
you've
laid
yourself
open
to
twenty
years.
now,
if
you
get
a
merciful
judge,
good
for
you,
i
mean,
that's
lagniappe
as
they
say
in
louisiana,
but
if
you
get
a
hanging
judge,
you've
got
twenty
years,
and
you
know
that
when
you
commit
the
crime,
whereas
we
have
a
system
now
where
you
entitled
to
no
more
than
so
much.
and
i
find
it
just
incompatible
with
a
jury
trial
right
to
say
that
that
fact
must
be
determined,
before
you
can
be
kept
in
jail.
and
yet
we're
going
let
it
be
determined
by
a
judge.
that
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
discretionary
sentencing
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
the
maximum
exposure.
if,
for
example,
one
of
the
factors
is
whether
the
crime
was
committed
with
a
firearm,
i
know
that
if
i
don't
use
a
firearm,
under
the
guidelines,
i
can
only
get
so
many
years,
so
somebody
has
to
find
that
i
used
a
firearm,
and
if
i
didn't,
my
maximum
exposure
is
less.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
each
one
is
appealable
separately,
each
one
is
appealable
separately,
it's
a
separate
legal
finding.
and
the
judge
doesn't,
in
discretionary
sentencing,
he
doesn't
have
to
make
any
factual
finding,
he
can
just
look
at
you
and
say,
"i
think
you're
a
bad
actor,
you've
got
forty
years.
"
we
have
a
system
here
where
the
judge
must
make
factual
findings,
and
each
one
is
appealable
if
he's
made
them
incorrectly.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
very
little
difference
between
telling
him
to
evaluate
it
with
regard
to
particular
elements
of
a
crime
and
asking
him
to
evaluate
it
with
regard
to
particular
sentencing
facts.
the
result
is
the
same.
you're
asking
him
to
evaluate
it
in
the
light
of
certain
facts
that
he
has
to
find.
whether
you
call
them
the
one
or
the
other,
he's
doing
the
same
thing.
if
he
finds
this
fact
you
get
three
more
years;
if
he
doesn't
find
it,
you
don't.
i
mean,
you
know,
as
far
as
the
real
outcome
is
concerned,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
you
call
it
an
"element"
or
a
"required
fact
for
sentencing"?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
still
in
the
judicial
branch,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
as
to
past.
i
mean,
it
may
have
a
significant
one-shot
impact
with
respect
to
cases
that
were
decided
without
blakely
in
mind.
but
for
the
future,
i,
i
just
don't
agree
with
you
that
changes
could
make
some
reduction.
i
think
changes
could
provide
for
jury
findings
whenever,
whenever
there's
a
need
for
a
higher
sentence
based
on
facts.
i
don't
know;
what
is
the
problem
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
text
do
you
have
to
take
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
the
"court",
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
which...
which
is
sometimes
done,
there
are
statutes
that
refer
to
the
court,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me,
when
there
is
an
ambiguity
that
construed
one
way
creates
a
constitutional
statute
and
construed
another
way
creates
an
unconstitutional
one,
it's
an
easy
call.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
can't
be,
maybe
the
judges
shouldn't
go,
be
going
around
guessing
how
many
people
have
been
defrauded.
or
you
know,
saying
"more
likely
than
not,
on
the
basis
of
the
kind
of
evidence
we
usually
don't
accept
in
criminal
trials.
"
why
is
that
okay?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
make
me
feel
any
good
if
i
spend
another
years
in
jail
because
of
it.
say,
"oh,
well,
don't
worry
about
it,
it
wasn't
an
element
of
the
crime,
after
all.
"
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
could
it
be
that
"shall"
does
not
mean
"may"?
right?
[laughter]
oh,
that's
not
it?
"shall"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--absolutely.
vote
me
for
that.
i
mean,
after
all,
judges
used
to
define
the
elements
of
crimes,
didn't
they?
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
elements
at
common
law
were
defined
by
judges
rather
than
by
the
legislature
didn't
mean
that
you
didn't
have
to
have
a
jury
find
them.
so
if
courts
are
going
to
establish
the
guidelines,
so
long
as
they
are
still
binding,
it
seems
to
me
you
still
need
a
jury
finding,
or
you
haven't
escaped
apprendi.
justice
antonin
scalia
judicial
discretionary
sentencing,
as
i
understood
it,
never
permitted
an
appellate
court
to
increase
the
sentence
given
by
the
district
judge.
do
you
know
of
any
cases,
where
an
appellate
court
said
the
district
judge
did
not
give
enough
years,
where
there
was
discretionary
sentencing?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be
under
statute,
but
i
do
not
know,
at
common
law,
that
when
you
talked
about
the
discretion
in
the
courts,
it
meant
that
in
a
criminal
case
a
court
of
appeals
could
increase
the
sentence
because
of
a...
because
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
sentencing
judge.
i'm
unfamiliar
with
any
such
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
that,
as
justice
o'connor
suggests,
deprives
the
statute
of
its
principal
purpose,
which
was
to
constrain...
to
constrain
judicial
discretion.
if
there's
anything
clear
about
it,
that
was
clear
about,
it
was
that
they
did
not
want
judges
to
have
as
much
discretion
as
they
had.
and
now
you
say
these
things
are
just
advisory.
it
seems
to
me
much
easier
to...
i
wanted
to
ask
you
one
very
precise
question.
assuming
i
think
"court"
can
mean
"jury"...
it
doesn't
have
to
mean
"the
judge"...
where
in,
in
the
whole
guideline
system,
how
many
sections
do
not
permit
the
use
of
"court"
to
mean
"jury"?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
there's
only
one
where,
where
it
may
not
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
may
be
the
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
anything
else
has
to
go?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
ought
to
get
rid
of
that
prosecutor.
that
didn't
seem
to
me
very
sensible
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
he
have
an
entitlement
to
a
certain
number
of
years
under
any
of
these
questions?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you're
sentenced
to
an
indeterminate
sentence,
he's
not
entitled
to
parole
at
any
time--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kelly,
i
would
be
interested
in
hearing
you
address
some
of
the
severability
problems
that
the
government
has
been
raising.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
might
be
a
due
process
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
hasn't
charge
bargaining
simply
been
replaced
with
fact
bargaining?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
couldn't
you
have
a
sentencing
phase
afterwards?
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you...
why
do
you
have
to
call
it
severability?
suppose
we
just
said
it's
clear
that
whenever
these
facts
have
not
been
found
by
a
jury,
the
guidelines
cannot
be
applied?
that
the
guidelines
are
unconstitutional,
as
applied,
when
there's
been
no
jury
finding,
and
leave
it.
we're
not
severing
any
particular
language,
we're
just
saying
that
that
portion,
that
proceeding
in
that
fashion
produces
and
unconstitutional
sentence.
and
then
let
the
government
work
out
how
it
wants
to
find
its
way
around
that
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
just
not
sure,
i
share
justice
stevens'
perplexity
as
to
whether
that's
really
properly
described
as
severing
part
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
care
whether
you
call
this
severing,
severability
or
not,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
you
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
assume,
don't
you,
that
any
solution
we
come
up
to
is
likely
to
be
an
interim
solution
anyway?
