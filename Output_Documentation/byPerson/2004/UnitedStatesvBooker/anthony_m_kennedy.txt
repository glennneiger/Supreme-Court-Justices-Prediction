anthony
m.

the
paradigm
that
the
cases
discussed
in
blakely
and
in
the
cases
leading
up
to
it
from
apprendi,
are
facts
such
as
the
amount
of
drugs,
was
there
a
weapon,
was
there
violence
performed
against
the
victim.
and
if
the
court
finds
that
these
are
so
much
like
an
element
that
they
have
to
be
proved,
and
adheres
to
its
jurisprudence
and
invalidates
the
guidelines
to
that
effect,
is
there
any
argument
that
either
the
government
makes
or
that
some
of
the
commentators
would
make,
that
there
are
other
kinds
of
sentencing
considerations
that
can
be
called
factual,
to
be
sure,
but
that
should
be
from
the
judge:
say,
lack
of
remorse
as
demonstrated
after
the
verdict;
the
fact
that
after
the
verdict,
investigation
shows
that
of
the
two
defendants,
one
was
the
real
ringleader,
streetwise,
the
other
was
kind
of
a
naive
dupe;
or
that
there
was
a
failure
to
cooperate
with
the
person
presenting
the...
preparing
the
sentencing
report.
these
are
facts
in
a
certain
way.
is
it
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound?
do
we
have
to
treat
all
of
these
as
factual,
or
is
there
any
progress
to
be
made
in
trying
to
see
if
there
are
some,
some
facts
that
are,
are
like
elements
and
some
that
are
not.
that
would
be
a...
it
would
take
a
number
of
cases,
i
suppose,
to
elaborate
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what,
what,
what
tests
would
you
propose,
or
the
commentators?
how
do
we
distinguish
the
permitted
kind
of
fact
that
the
judge
can
find,
and
those
that
must
be
for
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
have
you
escaped
apprendi?
if
discretion
is
cabined
by
guidelines
and
appellate
courts
review,
for
the
abuse
of
discretion
in
applying
those
guidelines,
why
isn't
that
the
same
kind
of
entitlement
that
the
apprendi/blakely
opinion
is
predicated
on
to
begin
with?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you...
if
you
interpret
"court"
to
mean
"jury",
how
many
of
the
sentencing
factors
which
will
be
submitted
to
the
jury
are...
would
be
a
radical
departure
from
the
tradition,
the
role
of
the
jury
in
the
criminal
system
in
the
anglo-american
tradition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
is
your
position
if
judges
simply
have
complete
discretion
to
sentence
within
a
maximum
range,
and
judge
a
gives
a
lot
of
maximum
sentences,
and
judge
b
doesn't?
is
that
system
constitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
it
in
our
legal
tradition...
what
policies
are
served
by
preferring
unexplained,
unarticulated,
standardless
discretion
to
a
system
in
which
the
judge
gives
reasons
and
follows
careful
standards
and
follows...
and
follows
standards
that
give
consistency
from
one
sentence
to
the
other?
why
should
the
former
be
preferred?
what
are
we
doing
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
policies--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
being
furthered
by
that,
other
than
wooden
adherence
to
apprendi
and
blakely?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
that,
isn't
that
ultimately
formalistic
and
contrary
to
our
whole
design
of
our
system,
which
is
to
learn
over
experience
and
to
codify
and
to
explain
what
considerations
we
take
into
account
in
applying
the
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
suppose,
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical...
like
the
california
indeterminate
sentencing
regime
which
applied
until
about
years
ago,
after
an
indeterminate
sentence,
the
parole
board
interviews
two
people
convicted
for
the
same
crime;
one
was
the
ringleader,
street-hardened
offender,
and
the
other
was
just
a
novice,
a
guy
that
went
along,
although
he...
they
both
committed
the
same
crime.
under
the
california
system,
the
former
would
be
given
a
projected
release
date
of
ten
years;
and
the
other,
a
projected
release
date
of
about
two
years.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
could
just
ask
one
more
question,
because
this
is
important
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
previous
california
system
in
which
it
was
an
indeterminate
sentence
and
the
correctional
authority
made
findings
which
set
the
sentence?
they
were...
they
were
committed
to
the
california--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--correctional
authority
for
the
term
prescribed
by
law,
and
that
was
set
after
the
fact,
post
hoc,
by
the
california
adult
authority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they're
not
increasing
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
an
indeterminate
sentence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
set
the
sentence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
it
was
just
sentenced,
the
judge,
for
the
term
prescribed
by
law.
and
an
agency,
after
interviewing
the
defendant,
after
looking
at
the
probation
board,
set
the
sentence.
the
term
prescribed
by
law
could
be
for
life.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
the
tradition
was
that
we
asked
the
jury
to
determine
what
crime
was
committed,
and
the
sentencing
judge
to
determine
the
context
in
which
it
was
committed.
