justice
stephen
g.
breyer
were
you
saying
51-case
set?
in
respect
to
that
deference,
i
suppose,
he
interprets
the
treaty
in
such
a
way
that
the
avena
decision,
in
his
opinion,
as
applied
to
this
51-set...
case
set
is
what
the
treaty
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it
is...
what
i'm
wondering
is
if
this
is
similar
to
that
insurance
case
out
of
california,
where,
in
fact,
we
gave
considerable
deference
to
mr.
eisenstat's
interpretation
of
the
relationship
of
the
treaty
to
the
insurance
laws
of
california.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
to
look
beyond
the
president's
interpretation
of
the
treaty.
it
happens
that
the
president
is
interpreting
it,
for
reasons
related
to
what
the
icj
said.
but
that
doesn't
make
us
have
to
look
beyond
the
reason
for
the
president
interpreting
it
the
way
he
wants.
i
mean,
do
we
have
to
defer
to
the
icj,
or
do
you...
is
it
not
sufficient
to
defer
to
the
president,
who
is
operating
within
his
foreign-affairs
power
for
whatever
set
of
reasons
he
deems
sufficient?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--before
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
this
is
also
a
jurisdictional.
they
decided
it
on
a
jurisdictional
ground.
they
decided
that
no
coa
lay,
for
the
reason
that
they
said.
now,
i
guess,
though
we
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to,
we
could
simply
say
they're
either
right
on
that
or
they're
wrong
on
that.
and
if
they're
wrong
on
it,
send
it
back,
and
then
you
can
argue
whether
there
are
other
grounds;
in
which
case,
they
could
go
into
waiver,
they
could
go
into
whether
"constitutional"
means
to
embrace
"treaty",
and
all
those
other
interesting
arguments
that
we
could
write
law-review
articles
about
that
were
not,
in
fact...
they
swirl
around
in
this
case,
and
you
would
not,
in
fact,
be
able
to...
you
wouldn't,
in
fact,
have
to
pronounce
on
them
now,
here,
when
they
really
haven't
been
thoroughly
gone
into,
below.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah,
that's
what
i'm
trying...
i'm
trying
to
get
to,
which
is,
what
is
actually
the
practical
thing
to
do
now?
should
we
stay
it,
with
a
short
per
curiam,
which
says,
"texas,
go
ahead",
or
should
we
do
something
else?
suppose
we
just
dismiss
this,
as
you
say,
on
the
alternative
ground.
well,
then
what
happens
if
texas
objects
to
the
president's
order
and
turns
out
to
be
right,
legally?
see,
if
that
were
true
and
then
the
review
showed
that
it
was
true...
i
don't
know
that
it
is
true,
but
if
it
were,
then
we
should
turn
to
the
fifth
circuit
claim,
and
there
are
51
cases
that
depend
on
it.
but
if
we've
dismissed
it,
by
that
time
it's
gotten
mixed
up
in
the
very
issue
you
raise.
the
question
is,
does
"constitutional"
embrace
"treaty"?
and
i
think
there
is
one
case
that
says
it
does,
actually;
or
a
treatise,
anyway.
so
that's
an
issue.
and
then
they
might
refuse
a
coa
on
that
ground.
and
then
there
might...
and
we'll
never
get
this
basic
question
decided.
i'm
trying
out
on
you
the
argument
for
actually
staying
it,
rather
than
digging
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think?
what
do
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the
question...
how
difficult
is
the
question?
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
issued
a
document
where
he
says,
"exercising
my
foreign-affairs
power,
in
my
opinion
the
treaty,
as
i...
i
accept
the
meaning
of
the
treaty
as
set
forth
by
the
icj
and
apply
it
to
these
51
cases.
"
so
he's
deciding
that.
and
why
doesn't
he
have
the
authority
to
decide
what
that
treaty
means
in
these
circumstances?
that's
his
decision.
and
texas
is
bound
by
the
constitution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
all
those
are...
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons.
does
that
counsel
in
favor
of
our
holding
this?
here
we
have
a
case
that
went
on
a
jurisdictional
ground.
and
if
we
affirm
or
reverse
that
jurisdictional
ground
from
the
court
of
appeals,
we'll
decide
a
lot
of
issues
that
will
create
guidance.
we
might
not
have
to
decide
it,
because
texas
may
deal
with
it;
or
we
may
decide,
if
they
come
out
the
other
way,
they're
wrong.
but
we
might.
and
that's
why
i
was
thinking
perhaps
we
should
hold
it
rather
than
dig
it,
particularly
because
that
other
issue
does
have
some
authority
the
other
way.
i
take
it
there's
a
treatise
in
the
fifth
circuit
case
which
does
say
that
the
word
"constitutional"
here
encompasses
"treaty".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
suppose
you
lose...
see,
i'm
thinking,
suppose
you
lose
in
the
texas
proceeding,
it
comes
here,
and,
for
whatever
reason,
suppose
you
lost
again...
you
might
not,
but
you
might...
in
which
case,
then
what
do
we
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
suppose
we
thought
they
were
right?
see,
suppose
you
lost
across
the
board?
that
would
be
the
argument
for
holding
it...
holding
it
because
then
you'd
have
another
vehicle
to
get
to
these
questions.
