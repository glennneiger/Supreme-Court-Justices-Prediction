justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
has
this
court
ever
just
said,
"fine,
we'll
hold
it
in
abeyance
and
come
back
next
term?
"
i
can't
recall
that
we've
done
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it
would
be
more
likely
that
we
would
dismiss
this,
improvidently
granted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
so
odd,
because
usually
what
happens,
if
there
is
something
that
could
occur
at
the
state
court
level,
is
the
state
court
itself
would
hold
off
until
this
court
had
resolved
whatever
the
case
was.
so,
this
is
a
very
unusual
request.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
shouldn't
we
just
go
ahead
and
decide
the
case,
if
we
can?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
presumably,
that
could
provide
some
cause
of
action,
quite
irrespective
of
the
icj
decision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
i
mean,
you
don't--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--you
don't
really
have
to
get
into
whether
that
judgement
is
enforceable
here.
i
mean--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--we
could
look
at...
look
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
the
habeas
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
have
a
question
that
is
much
along
the
same
lines,
whether
this
court
must
apply
avena
as
the
rule
of
decision,
or
perhaps
say,
"no,
it
does
not
have
to
do
that.
"
then
you're
left
with
looking
at
the
treaty
itself.
and
does
that...
can
that
take
effect
as
american
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
can--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
it
open
in
this
case
to...
for
this
court
to
apply
that,
not
avena?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
open
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
think
it
can't
control?
now,
then
what's
open
to
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
president's
action
here
before
the
court
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
only
peripherally.
is
that
an
issue
for
us
to
decide
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
hadn't
thought
so.
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--be
waived?
can
that
be
waived?
and
did
texas
raise
that
issue
in
the
fifth
circuit
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
fifth
circuit
by
texas,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
assume,
although
we
haven't
so
decided,
that
that
can
just
be
waived.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
do
you
believe
we
shouldn't
stay
it?
i
mean--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
an
opinion,
it's
based
on
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
cruz,
maybe
the
treaty
becomes
part
of
federal
law
if
it's
properly
ratified
and
signed,
as
this
one
was.
now,
it's
possible
that
the
treaty
itself
gives
certain
individually
enforceable
rights
to
mr.
medellin.
and
we
can
disregard
the
question
of
whether
the
avena
judgement
is
enforceable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it
would
be
open
to
this
court,
presumably,
to
say,
that
treaty
became
part
of
federal
law
when
it
was
ratified,
and
congress
can
enact
subsequent
laws.
it
did
in
aedpa.
but,
in
any
event,
the
treaty
could
give
rise
to
individual
enforceable
rights.
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
is
their
whole
question
of
the
coa
waivable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is,
though,
a
treaty
that's
been
duly
ratified
and
signed
enforceable
as
part
of
our
federal
law,
as
this
one
is
drafted?
