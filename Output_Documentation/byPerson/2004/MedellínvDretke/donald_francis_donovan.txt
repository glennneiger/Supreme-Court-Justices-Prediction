mr.
donald
francis
donovan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
was
exceptionally
important
when
the
court
granted
it,
and
it's
even
more
important
now.
it
belongs
in
this
court.
at
the
same
time,
mr.
medellin
requests
that
the
court
hold
the
case
while
he
goes
back
to
texas.
i'd
like
to
explain
why,
before
i
turn
to
the
merits.
under
its
decision
last
year
in
ex
parte,
so
far,
texas
has
modified
its
longstanding
two-forums
rule.
court
of
criminal
appeals
will
now
entertain
a
subsequent
application
for
habeas
writ,
even
if
there
are
proceedings
pending
before
a
federal
court,
so
long
as
the
federal
court
stays
its
proceedings.
the
court
designed
that
procedure
so
that
a
habeas
petitioner
could
return
to
state
court
to
exhaust
an
unexhausted
claim
without
compromising
his
right
to
federal
habeas--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
not
specify;
but
we
find,
of
course,
ourselves
in
an
unusual
posture,
in
the
sense
that
the
sequence
of
events
here
are
such
that
even...
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
the
avena
judgement
claim,
the
court
has--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
it's
an...
it
is,
in
fact,
an
unusual
posture.
and
it--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
the
case,
though,
has
not
been
improvidently
granted,
with
the
greatest
respect
to
the
court.
of
course,
the
case
was
important
when
the
court
granted
it.
the
question,
whether
or
not
the
united
states
will
comply
with
an
international
obligation
that
every
actor
here...
the
united
states,
texas,
and
the
petitioner...
all
recognize
as
binding,
is
an
important
question.
the
president
has
now
come
in
and
said
that
it's
even
more
important,
by
saying
that,
in
fact,
the
united
states
will
comply.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
we
recognize
that
it's
an
unusual
request,
because
of
the
unusual
circumstances.
and,
of
course,
the
alternative,
if
the
court
is
not
prepared
to
stay,
or,
for
example,
vacate,
in
light
of
the
presidential
determination,
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
actually,
i
think
that
a
stay
would
actually
show
respect
to
each
of
the
relevant
actors
here.
and
so--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
we
believe
that
there
are,
in
fact,
firm
grounds
on
which
this
court
could
grant...
could
decide
the
question
presented,
because,
in
fact,
for
the
reasons...
there
are
really
three
points
here...
for
the
reasons
we've
laid
out,
the
court,
under
the
direct
command
of
the
supremacy
clause,
has...
can
give
effect
to
the
avena
judgement
as
the
rule
of
decision.
the
president's
determination,
in
fact,
eliminates
the...
even
setting
aside
its
independent
force,
eliminates
the
basic
objection
of
texas
to
that
course
of
action.
and
then,
of
course,
there's
the
basic
independent
full
force
of
the
supremacy
clause.
so
if
i
may
move
to
that,
the
court,
as
i
said,
has
recognized
the
importance
of
the
united
states
complying
with
an
international
obligation
reflected
in
treaties
entered
into
by
the
democratically
elected
representatives
of
the
american
people.
i
want
to
address
the
question
presented
first,
because,
i...
before...
setting
aside
the
presidential
determination...
and
just
take
a
look
at
where
we
stand
after
the
briefing
by
the
parties
as
a...
on
the
question
whether
or
not
the
avena
judgement
provides
the
rule
of
decision.
first
of
all,
there's
an
extraordinary
amount
of
agreement
between
petitioner
and
respondent.
respondent
agrees
that
the
vienna
convention
is
a
binding
legal
commitment
of
the
united
states.
the
respondent
agrees
that
the
convention
is
self-executing.
the
respondent
agrees
that
the
united
states
agreed
to
submit
disputes
concerning
the
application
and
interpretation
of
the
convention
to
the
icj.
he
agrees
that
the
united
states
agreed
that
any
determination
by
the
international
court
of
justice
would
be
binding.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
there
is
a...
there
is
a...
there
are
basically
three
objections
that
the
respondents
made.
one
of
them
is
the
cause
of
action.
but
the
respondent
confuses
the
creation
of
a
cause
of
action
with
what
the...
a
treaty
will
typically
do.
the
treaty
here
lays
out
the
rights,
and
the
treaty
lays
out
an
individual
right,
as
determinated
by
the
icj.
the
treaty
will
not
customarily
create
the
cause
of
action.
for
how
the
united
states
will
abide
by
its
legal
obligations...
that
is,
how
the
united
states
will
give
effect
to
the
international
obligation...
we
look
to
domestic
law.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
that's
exactly
right.
but
we
would
look...
we
would
look
to
how
the
united
states
has
provided
for
the
implication
of
that
international
obligation.
here,
in
the
first
instance,
we
have
a
direct
command
of
the
supremacy
clause,
a
very
fundamental
choice
made
by
the
framers--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
private
right
of
action
is
found
here
in
the
habeas
statute
itself,
which
provides
that
a
person
in
custody
in
violation
of
laws,
treaties,
or
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
can
seek--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
it
could...
it...
the
cause
of
action
is,
itself,
provided
by--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
rest
of
the--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
that's
right.
i
mean,
there
are
three...
there
are
three
basic
questions
that
need
to
be--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
it
may
be
that,
because
of
the
character
of
the
typical
dispute
that
the
international
court
of
justice
hears,
that
it
does
not
typically
address
such
a
question.
but,
plainly
it
has
jurisdiction
to
do
so
when
the
underlying
treaty
confers
a
right.
and
that's
exactly
one
of
the
questions
that
was
litigated
between
mexico
and
the
united
states
in
the
avena
judgement.
and
the
court
held
that,
in
fact,
this
treaty
does
provide
individual
rights.
so--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
it
has,
of
course,
held,
in...
first,
in
lagrand
and
then
here
in
avena.
in
most
of
the
cases
the
icj
has
held,
however...
it
has
dealt
previously,
for
example,
with
rights
in
this
situation.
for
example,
rights
in
the
nature
of
diplomatic
protection.
for
example,
when
the
united
states
went
to
the
icj
in
the
tehran
hostages
case,
it
went,
not
only
in
its
own
behalf,
but
in
the
exercise
of
diplomatic
protection.
and
in
that
posture,
the
icj--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--but,
in
fact,
in
that
case
the
united
states
did
assert
the
rights
of
its
nationals
who
were
held
hostage.
it
didn't...
the
case
didn't
come
down
on
that
point.
but,
likewise,
the
famous
barcelona--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
for
example,
in
the
barcelona
traction
case,
which
is
another
case
where,
again,
there
were
rights
of
a
particular
company
and
a
particular
national
decided
with...
under
the
guise
of
diplomatic
protection.
and
that's
the
posture
which
this
case
went
forward.
mexico
asserted
rights
not
only
on
its
own
behalf,
but
on
behalf
of
its
nationals.
and,
therefore,
if
we
think
of
the...
the
three
objections
that
was...
the
respondent
has
made
to
whether
this
court
can
give
us
back
the
avena
judgement,
they
come
down...
they
include
the
two
we've
just
discussed,
and
one
more.
first,
they've
said
there
are
no
individual
rights
here.
but,
of
course,
the
treaty,
as
this
court
suggested
in
breard,
talks
specifically
about
rights...
quote/unquote,
"rights".
and
that,
of
course,
is
what
the
icj
held.
if
the
avena
judgement
is
binding,
if
the
avena
judgement
informs
the
vienna
convention
with
binding
effect,
then
that
question
is
not
the
question
this
court
needs
to
answer.
the
second
point
that--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
only
limitations
of
the
treaty-making
power
are
affirmative
litigations...
affirmative
limitations
within
the
constitution,
itself.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
and
if--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--no,
the...
obviously,
a
treaty
would
not
be
able
to
amend
the
constitution.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
a
treaty
would
not
be...
this
treaty
does
not
do
that.
when
the--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
but
the...
but
the
court
has...
it...
the
court
has
regularly...
and
it
has
never
been
an
objection
to
article
iii
power
to
give
effect
to
a
judgement
that
has
been
rendered
in
another
sphere
by
another
adjudicatory
authority.
that
happens
all
the
time
with
respect
to--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--but
this
is
a
question--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
what
the
court
would
be
giving
effect
to
is
the
determination
by
the
political
branches
themselves
to
enter
into
the
treaty.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
the
treaty
does
take
effect
as
american
law.
and--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--in
fact--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
the
court
could,
in
fact,
apply
the
treaty.
it
could
reach
its
own
interpretation
of
the
treaty,
in
accord
with
the
avena
judgement.
but
we
think--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
it
surely
would
be
open
in
this
case,
but
it
would
not
be
open
at
this
point.
we've
suggested
alternative
bases
by
which
the
court
could
conform
with
avena.
but
we
do
believe
that
avena,
in
fact,
controls
the
decision,
for
this
reason,
that,
in
the
first
instance,
the
political
branches
have
agreed
to
the
substantive
obligations
under
the
treaty;
in
the
second
place--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
if
the...
if
the
court
decided
that
the
avena
judgement
did
not
control,
then
it
would
obviously
go
to
the
terms
of
the
treaty
itself.
but
our
argument
is
that,
in
fact,
by
virtue
of
the
political
branches'
decision
and
in
operation
of
the
treaty...
of
the
supremacy
clause,
the
court
must
be...
must
give
effect
if
the
court
reached
a
decision--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
the
court
has--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
no,
the
treaty...
the
court
has
traditionally
accorded
deference
to
the
executive's
determination,
but
has
not...
has
not
given
that--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--because
it's
not
just
the
president
that's
done
that;
it's
the
treaty-makers,
it's
the
president
acting
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
in
a
context
in
which
they
are
empowered
to
authorize
a
treaty...
enter
into
a
treaty.
and
they've
done--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
the--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
question
that
we'd
ask--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
the...
we've
asked
that
the
court
take
account
of
the
president's
determination
in
this
respect.
the
vienna
convention
sets
out
a...
sets
out
substantive
obligations.
the
icj...
we've
agreed
to
go
to
the
icj
for
the
interpretation
obligation
of
those
obligations.
the
icj
has
now
ruled.
the
only
objections,
in
effect,
that
the
respondent
has
made
is
to
say,
"this
court
can't
decide
that
question.
"
because
it's
within
the
power
of
the
political
branches.
in
effect,
it
said,
"this
court
should
step
back
and
await
the
permission
of
the
executive.
"
and
in
mr.
medellin's
view,
this
court
does
not
need
to
do
that.
but
if
you
did
need
to
do
that,
which
is
the
respondent's
essential
objection,
the
president
has
now
said,
not
only
should...
not
only
can
the
court
give
effect
to
the
avena
a
judgement,
but
that
it's
in
the
paramount
interest
of
the
united
states
that
it
do
so,
and
that
it
do
so
promptly,
and
that,
therefore,
any
question
about
the...
about
the
effectiveness
of
the
avena
judgement
has,
on
texas'
own
terms--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--on
the
respondent's--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
it
goes
to
the
supremacy
clause
itself,
justice
kennedy.
it's--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
is
direct
precedent
in
this
court
for
this
circumstance.
we
recognize
that
the
circumstances
presented
in
these
particular--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
he
has,
in
fact,
come--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
that's
right.
he
has...
he
has,
in
fact,
endorsed
the
notion
that
the
united
states
should
comply.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
it...
that
is
true.
and
the
garamendi--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
the--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--but
the
garamendi
case
did,
in
fact,
endorse
the
president's
power.
it's
similar
to
the
dames
&
moore
case--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
that's...
that
is
a
distinction
in
the
cases,
but
they
still
come
down
to
a
notion
that...
both
garamendi
and
dames
&
moore...
to
the
president's
authority
to
give
effect
to
international
obligations.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
and
here
we
have--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
that's
right.
but
that's...
that
situation
doesn't
really
distinguish
the
cases,
because
in
dames
&
moore
v.
regan
there
was,
in
fact,
an
agreement,
and
the
president
acted
pursuant
to
that
agreement.
but
here
we
have--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
they
did
act
pursuant
to
the
agreement,
and
that's
what
the
court
decided,
but
that's
precisely
what
the
president
is
doing
here.
the
president
is
giving
effect
to
commitments
made
by
the
united
states
in
the
vienna
convention,
in
the
optional
protocol,
in
the
icj
statute
and
in
the
united
nations
charter.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
so
if--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that's
true,
but...
and
the
court
looked
at
the...
the
court
did
not
reexamine
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
what
the
court
decided
in
that
case
was
that
it
was
within
the
president's
foreign-affairs
authority
to
enter
into
an
agreement
that
would
essentially
required
american
claimants
to
go
to
the
iranian-united
states
claims
tribunal.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
the
treaty
itself
is
what
the
united
states
has
committed
itself
to.
it's
the
treaty
in
addition
that
the
united
states--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
that's
precisely
why
we've
said,
in
fact,
what...
there
are
two
independent
sources
of
authority
here,
because,
by
operation
of
the
supremacy
clause,
the
icj,
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
avena
judgement
would
be
given
effect.
now
we
have
an
independent
source
of
right
in
the
form
of
the
president's
determination.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
the
president
has
said
that
it
should
be
given
effect,
and
hasn't...
and
hasn't
said
that
it
shouldn't
be
in
federal
habeas.
to
the
contrary,
the
president
has
indicated
that,
in
fact,
habeas
would
be
available.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
that's
right,
there
would
be--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--there
would
surely
be
habeas
jurisdiction.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
at
this
point,
of
course,
the
court
need
not
address
that
question
on
this...
on
this
petition.
the
question
that
the
court
granted
was,
will
the
united
states
abide
by
the
avena
judgement?
and
that--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--question
would
be
answered
without--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
of
course,
for
the
reasons
we've
laid
out
in
our
brief,
we
do
not
regard
it
as
jurisdictional
for
this
court.
the
court
clearly
has
jurisdiction
under
the
petition
to
decide
the
questions
on
the
basis
that
they
should
decide
the
question
presented.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
but
even
if
it--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--no,
but--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--but
this--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--but
the
coa
is
a
jurisdictional
requirement
for
an
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals.
this
comes
to
this
court
as...
on
the
denial
of
a
certificate
of
appealability--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--and
on
a
petition
from
that.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
and
so,
the
question
raised
by--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--but
the
court...
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
an
application
for
certificate
of
appealability.
and
this
court,
in
turn,
has
jurisdiction
to
grant
a
petition
from
the
denial
of
the
certificate
of
appealability.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
and
in
that
posture--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
court
can
decide
the
question
presented.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
first
of
all,
we
believe
that
in
the
posture
that
this
case
comes
to
this
court,
there
has
been
a
substantial
denial
of
a
constitutional
right,
even
in
the
terms
that
texas
defines
the
statute,
because
what
we
have
here
is
a
claim
based
on
the
avena
judgement...
i
mean,
the
icj's
interpretation
and
application
of
the
avena
judgement
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
effect
that
had
been
defaulted
prior
to
its
coming
into
existence.
because
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals
judgement
that
the
avena...
dismissing
the...
or
denying
the
avena...
deciding
the
avena
judgement
claim...
was
to
say...
was
to
give
effect
to
a
procedural
default
of
the
avena
judgement
when
it
had
not
yet--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that
is--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
in
that--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
it's
a
violation
here
of
both
the
due
process
clause
and
the
supremacy
clause.
due
process--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--because
it
was
an
arbitrary
denial
of
a
forum
in
which
to
hear
the
avena
judgement
claim,
not
simply
the...
a
different
source
of
right.
in
other
words,
although
the
avena
judgement
claim
comes
up
on
texas
as
a
proposition
as
a...
under
a
treaty,
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
to
deny
that
claim
without
giving
it
a
forum.
that
is
to
say,
without...
that...
before
it
had
been
raised
itself,
before
it
even
existed...
because
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
to
give
effect
to
a
procedural
default
of
a
right
that
hadn't
come
into
effect.
and,
therefore,
in
that
context,
it's
effectively
a
due
process
claim.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
in
addition
it's
a
violation--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--with
respect
to
this
claim,
aedpa
itself
would
be,
in
our
view,
ousted
by
the
charming
betsey
principle.
but
in
the
particular
context
here,
you
don't
have...
you
don't
have
a
conflict
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
claims
themselves;
you
have
a
constitutional
claim
based
on
a
denial
a
right
that
did
not
exist,
and
you
also
have
a
constitutional
claim
based
on
the
supremacy
clause
itself.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
that's--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--and
perhaps...
but
the
effect
of
that...
and
perhaps
a
more
prudent
way
to
put
it
is
that
the
effect
of
that
is
to
deny
mr.
medellin
a
forum,
an...
arbitrarily
deny
him
a
forum
on
the
effect
of
the
avena
judgement,
because
the
effect
was
to
deny
the
avena
judgement
claim
based
on
a
procedural
default
before
the
avena
judgement
had
been
rendered.
if
i
may
save
the
remaining...
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondent
came
to
this
court
saying
that
he
agrees
with
mr.
medellin
that
america
could
keep
her...
should
keep
her
word.
here's
the
situation
we
have.
everybody
agrees
that
these
treaties
are
binding.
everybody
agrees
now
that
the
president
has
determined
that
mr.
medellin
should
get
exactly
what
he
came
to
this
court
asking
for,
which
is
review
and
reconsideration
from
the
state
courts.
the...
as
mr.
dreeben
has
pointed
out,
and
as
we
advised
the
court
last
week,
in
order
to
protect
against
any
statute
of
limitations
bar,
we
have,
in
fact,
filed
in
texas,
in
order
to
make
these
claims,
pending
the
disposition
here.
and
mr.
medellin
is
prepared
to
go
forward
in
state
court,
making
exactly
these
claims,
which
the
state
courts
have
never
had
an
opportunity
to
occasion.
the
question
here
is,
how
does
this
court
fulfill
its
function
of
ensuring
that
the
united
states
complies
with
its
international
obligations
that
the
president
has
now
confirmed
he
will
comply
with?
and,
of
course,
the
question
here
is
not
whether
this...
whatever
this
court
does
with
respect
to
the
question
presented
here...
that
is,
does
the
avena
judgement
having
binding
effect
under
the
supremacy
clause
+/?
in
this
case,
would
no
in
any
way
constrain
the
president's
determination
at
some
future
point,
because
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
president
has
said
"comply".
and
so,
this
case
does
not
raise
questions...
if
it
operated
directly
under
the
supremacy
clause...
does
not
raise
a
question
about
what
would
happen
if,
in
some
future
case,
the
political
branches
made
a
different
determination
once
an
icj
judgement
came
to
this
country.
here,
we
have
the
president
saying,
"you
should
do
exactly
what...
the
united
states...
what
the
icj
said
to
do.
"
so
the
question
is,
how
does
one
proceed?
we
have
proposed
a
means
of
going
forward
that,
in
our
view,
is
respectful
to
the
authority
of
this
court,
that
is
respectful
to
the
texas
courts,
and
that's
respectful
to
the
president;
and
that
is,
to
go
forward
on
the
subsequent
application
in
the
texas
courts,
giving
them
two
issues
that
they've
never
had
a
chance
to
address,
the
avena
judgement
claim
and
the
claim
under
the
president's
determination.
what
should
not
happen
is,
that
application
should
not
be
compromised
by
any
adverse
action
on
this
court,
and
the
suggestion
of
a
dismissal
might
have
compromising
effects.
at
a
minimum,
it
might
be
perceived
as
leaving
in
place
a
judgement
that
this
court
has
already
said
warranted
review
and
is
now,
in
our
view,
fatally
undermined
by
the
president's
determination,
as
it
has
been
previously
fatally
undermined
by
the
plain
command
of
the
supremacy
clause.
in
addition,
we
would,
no
doubt...
we're
already
hearing
arguments
from
the
opposition
to
the
motion
to
stay...
we
would
no
doubt
hear
arguments
that,
on
some
subsequence
habeas
which
the
united
states
says
is...
would
be
available,
that
that
would
be
a
second
or
successor
habeas,
even
though
mr.
medellin
has
never
had
a
chance
to
bring
the...
otherwise,
to
bring
these
claims
to
the
court.
and,
therefore,
the
court
might,
at
some
point...
at
this
point,
the
best
thing
to
do,
if
we
are
going
to
achieve
expeditious
compliance
with
the
president's
determination...
is,
in
fact,
to
stay;
not
to
deal
with
any
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised
here,
but
to
let
the
texas
courts
deal
with
them
in
the
first
instance.
if
it
comes
back
to
this
court
in
the
posture
of
a
direct...
for
example,
request
for
certiorari
review
from
a
judgement
of
the
texas
courts...
there
should
be
no
adverse
impact
from
anything
this
court
did
at
this
posture,
simply
because
mr.
medellin
came
here.
and,
indeed,
it
was
mr.
medellin's
case
that
presumably
prompted
the
president
to
act.
that
would
be
unfair,
and
it
would
complicated
the
court's
own
disposition.
what
do
we
have
texas
saying
before
this
court?
effectively,
texas
has
come
into
this
courtroom
and
said
neither
the
president
nor
this
court
can
effect...
can
give
effect
of
the
avena
judgement,
because
texas
has
opposed
the
court's
authority
under
the
direct
operation
of
the
supremacy
clause,
and
now
texas
has
told
the
court
that
the
president
can't
do
this
either.
and
in
the
face
of
that
suggestion,
mr.
medellin
has
every
hope
and
expectation
that
the
texas
courts
will
see
their
obligations
under
the
supremacy
clause
in
a
form
of
both
the
avena
judgement
interpreting
and
applying
the
vienna
convention
and
the
president's
determination,
differently
than
the
texas
authorities
have
so
far
announced.
but
if
it
does
not,
this
court
should
have
the
full
complement
of
means
at
its
disposal
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
united
states
complies
with
its
international
obligations.
mr.
dreeben
has,
himself,
just
suggested
that
there
may
be
circumstances
if
it
were
not
otherwise
achievable.
it's
hard
to
think
of
a
more
important
case
for
the
exercise
of
this
court's
extraordinary
writs.
but
none
of
that
should
be
in
any
way
compromised
by
a
dismissal,
at
this
point,
simply
because
the
president
came
in
in
the
midst...
in
fact,
concurrently...
into
mr.
medellin's
own
case
before
this
court
and
made
this
determination.
instead,
as
we'd
suggest,
the
appropriate
thing
would
be...
to
do
is
to
stay
the
case,
to
allow
it
to
go
forward
in
the
texas
courts.
but
if
the
court
does
not
wish
to
stay,
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that,
at
this
point,
under
direct
command
of
the
supremacy
clause
endorsed
by
the
president's
determination,
as
well
as
the
president's
determination
itself,
the
court
should
give
effect
to
the
united
states'
promises.
thank
you
very
much.
