mr.
r.
ted
cruz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset,
two
issues
bear
emphasis.
first,
the
court
need
not,
and
should
not,
address
the
many
interesting
issues
of
international
law
and
constitutional
law
that
swirl
about
this
case.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
they
are,
indeed.
and
this
may
launch
a
thousand
law-review
articles.
but
with
respect
to
the
question
before
the
court,
there
is
a
simple
and
straightforward
statutory
basis
to
resolve
this
case;
namely,
that
section
2253
of
the
aedpa
does
not
allow
a
certificate
of
appealability
for
nonconstitutional
claims.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
o'connor,
texas
did
not
explicitly
waive
this
ground
before
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--that's
correct,
it
was
not.
but--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well,
this
court
has
characterized
the
standards
for
a
coa
as
jurisdictional
in
a
threshold
inquiry.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
breyer,
there
are
alternative
jurisdictional
grounds
this
court
could
address,
but
the
coa
ground
is
straightforward.
it
flows
from
the
direct
text.
and
petitioner
has
given
this
court
no
reason
to
disagree
with
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
looked
at
this
question,
all
of
whom
have
determined
that
"constitutional"
means
"constitutional".
it
doesn't
mean
"treaty",
it
doesn't
mean
"statute".
and
that's
every
court
of
appeals
that's
looked
at
that.
given
that
that
ground
is
direct
and
straightforward,
there
is
no
need
for
this
court
to
venture
into
the
difficult
constitutional
areas,
the
difficult
questions
of
international
law,
when
there
is
a
straightforward
statutory--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--we
do
not
believe
the
court
should
stay
this
action,
because
whatever
the
resolution
of
the
subsequent
proceedings
that
are
now
filed
in
texas,
the
resolution
of
that
question
will
not
control
the
federal-law
questions
here.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
our
first
position
would
be,
as
justice
o'connor
said,
that
that
question
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
that
will
surely
be
litigated
in
the
texas
state
courts.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
ginsburg,
this
weekend,
medellin
filed
a
subsequent
state
habeas
application
with
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
in
which
he
asked
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
stay
its
hand,
pending
this
court's
decision
whether
this
court
should
stay
its
hand,
pending
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
resolution--
[laughter]
and
so,
that
is
a
50-page
filing
that
they
just
filed
this
weekend
in
which--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well,
what
it
asks
for
is
to
authorize
a
subsequent
state
habeas
proceeding
based
upon
the
president's
determination,
which
he
characterizes
as
the
predicate
for
a
new
claim.
and
if
that
is
correct,
then
there
is
yet
another
problem
to
his
getting
relief
here,
which
is
that
he
has
failed
to
exhaust
what
he
claims
is
now
the
predicate.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
with
respect
to
whether
the
presidential
determination
is
authorized,
any...
that
matter
will
be
resolved
in
subsequent
state
court
litigation.
any
responsible
state
attorney--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--we
would
respectfully
submit,
as
would
any
responsible
state
attorney
general,
that
there
are
significant
constitutional
problems
with
a
unilateral
executive
determination
displacing
generally
applicable
criminal
laws.
but
whatever
the
resolution
of
that
question,
that
would
ultimately
be
reviewable
by
this
court,
on
certiorari
review.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
there
absolutely
are
texas
procedures
in
which
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
president's
determination
can
be
litigated.
and
we
would
anticipate
that
that
would
be
litigated--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--and
resolved--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--whatever
the
resolution--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
do
not
believe
the
court
should
stay
it.
digging
it
would
be
an
option.
i
also
believe...
i
believe
the
most
correct--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
don't
believe
the
court
should--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--because
whatever
the
resolution
in
the
state
court
litigation,
the
resolution
of
that
question
will
not
impact
the
legal
question
before
this
court
now,
which
is,
on
first
federal
habeas,
a
claim
that
was
filed
that
did
not
rely
on
avena
when
it
was
filed,
did
not
rely
on
the
presidential
determination--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--that
is
true.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that
is
true.
that
is
frequently
the
case,
that
in
a...
in
a
case
that
is
being
litigated,
there
are
other
proceedings
that
have
the
potential
to
make
something
moot.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
absolutely.
and
the
difficult
questions
about
the
constitutional
authority
for
the
executive
determination
may
come
back
to
this
court,
but
they're
not
presented
by
the
case
right
now
before
the
court.
the
most
direct
avenue,
i
would
submit,
for
this
court
is
to
resolve
this
decision
by
affirming
the
fifth
circuit
judgement,
and
by
affirming
it
on
the
grounds
that
a
coa
could
not
issue
because
this
was
not
a
constitutional
claim.
and
that
would
necessarily
entail
affirming
breard
to
the
extent
that
breard
noted
that
a
subsequently
enacted
statute,
the
aedpa,
to
the
extent
of
a
conflict,
superceded
the
vienna
convention.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
we
would
agree
that
the
fact
that
the
president
has
acted
underscores
the
point
made
by
both
texas
and
the
united
states,
that
the
responsibility
for
determining
the
remedy
to
the
avena
judgement
is
found
in
the
political
branches.
and
the
fact
that
the
president
is
acting
underscores
this,
that
there
is
no
precedent
for
an
icj
judgement
being
judicially
enforceable.
indeed,
respondent
is
aware
of
no
country
in
the
world
that
accords
binding
effect
to
icj
judgements
in
their
own
domestic
courts.
and--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
o'connor,
that's--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--that's
absolutely
correct,
that
this
court--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--to
be
sure,
this
court
could
certainly
determine
that
the
vienna
convention
gives
rises
to
the
individual
rights.
that
interpretation,
however,
would
conflict
with
the
express
language
of
the
preamble
to
the
treaty,
and
would
also
conflict
with
the
consistent
position
of
the
executive
branch
since
1969,
when
this
treaty
was
ratified.
for
those
36
years,
the
state
department
has
consistently
answered
the
question,
that
the
vienna
convention
does
not
give
rise
to
individual
rights.
and,
indeed--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
breard
case
simply
made
reference
to...
that
there
was,
arguably,
individual
rights.
it
didn't
purport
to
resolve
that.
it
said,
even
if
there
were,
it
is
barred
by
aedpa.
so
i
don't
believe
the
breard
case
answers
it,
one
way
or
the
other;
but,
given
the
united
states'
consistent
position...
and,
indeed,
it
uses
very
similar
language
in
later
treaties,
such
as
the
two
terrorism
treaties
that
are
cited
in
the
united
states'
brief.
it
is
worth
underscoring
that
on
every
question
currently
before
this
court
in
this
proceeding,
the
united
states
agrees
entirely
with
texas,
that
this
court's
resolution
of
this
case
should
be
to
affirm
the
judgement
of
the
fifth
circuit
because
a
coa
should
not
have
issued.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
only
in
the
most
threshold
sense;
because,
on
its
face,
the
president's
proclamation,
or
determination,
is
focused
only
on
state
courts,
and
what
the
president
says
is
that
he
has
determined
that
the
avena
decision
will
have
binding
effect
in
state
courts.
so,
according
to
the
executive
determination,
that
does
not
have
a
binding
effect
on
this
proceeding;
but,
rather,
on
a
subsequent--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--we
don't
disagree
that
the
executive
could
have
chosen
other
avenues.
nevertheless,
medellin's
argument
that,
given
the
executive
has
said,
"this
should
have
effect
in
some
other
proceeding.
"
we
should
disregard
what
the
executive
has
said
about
this
proceeding
and
apply
it
here,
notwithstanding
the
president's
express
determination
it
wouldn't
apply
here.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well,
certainly
under
the
terms
of
the
president's
order,
where
the
president
said
that
he's
determined
it
shall...
should
be
given
effect,
quote,
"by
having
state
courts
give
effect.
"
by
the
express
terms
of
the
order,
particularly
as
explained
in
the
united
states'
brief,
where
that
is
conjoined
with
the
position
of
the
united
states,
that
in
this
proceeding,
on
appeal
from
the
first
federal
habeas
proceeding,
that
there
is
no
effect
to
the
avena
judgement.
that's
the
position
the
united
states
has
articulated.
and
so,
to
the
extent
this
court
gives
deference
to
the
executive's
position...
and
in
matters
of
foreign
affairs,
this
court
has
historically
given
great
deference
to
that
position...
that
position
states
that
that
should
have
no
effect
upon
this
proceeding.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
respectfully,
if
we
were
to
lose,
and
if
medellin
were
to
prevail,
his
position
could
potentially
open
the
door
to
the
reconsideration
of
the
over
100
foreign
nationals
that
are
on
death
row
across
this
country,
and,
beyond
that,
to
thousands--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but
the
president's
order
is,
by
its
term,
confined
to
the
51
mexican
nationals.
medellin's
theory
is
not.
medellin's
theory
is
not
even
confined
to
those
on
death
row;
but,
rather,
would
potentially
extend
to
the
thousands
of
foreign
nationals--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--fifty-one.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that's
true
with
respect
to
the
executive
determination.
but
the
icj's
decision
went
beyond
its
authorizing
statute
and
explicitly...
even
though
its
authorizing
statute
says
the
icj
has
jurisdiction
only
to
speak
to
the
matter
directly
before
it,
in
paragraph
151
the
icj
said
it
wasn't
speaking
just
to
the
matter
before
it.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but
medellin's
theory
that
avena
should
be
applied
as
a
binding
rule
of
judgement,
even
without
subsequent
proceedings
before
the
icj,
could
be
taken
to
support
granting
habeas
relief
in
other
proceedings
for
individuals
whose
cases
weren't
litigated,
particularly
given
that
the
icj
in
avena
purports--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--surely.
although
the
terms
of
the
icj
decision
purport
to
apply
more
broadly
than
to
these
51,
and
they
explicitly
say
that
this
cannot
be
taken
to
imply
that
this
does
not
apply
to
other
foreign
nationals,
notwithstanding
its
jurisdictional
statute
that
prevents
it
from
doing
that.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
under
the
terms
of
the
applicable
treaties,
the
icj
has
jurisdiction
to
determine,
as
a
matter
of
international
law,
if
there
is
a
treaty
breach.
but
those
treaties
also
specify
the
remedy
for
any
judgement
of
the
icj,
and
that
remedy,
under
article
94
of
the
u.n.
charter,
is
recourse
to
the
security
council.
that
was
explicitly
adopted
as
a
political
remedy,
because
it
is
the
prerogative
of
the
president
and
the
political
branches
to
determine
how
to
respond.
one
of
the
responses
open
to
the
political
branch,
as
the
united
states
has
articulated,
is
to
decline
to
respond.
and
with
respect
to
the
nicaragua
case,
that's
exactly
what
the
united
states
did.
in
that
situation...
and
that
matter
was
ultimately
litigated;
judge
mikva,
for
the
d.c.
circuit,
wrote
a
compelling
opinion
laying
out
that
decisions
of
the
icj
are
not
judicially
enforceable
in
u.s.
courts;
they
are,
rather,
matters
sovereign-to-sovereign.
that
same
reasoning
applies
here.
it
is
a
matter
for
the
executive
to
determine
how
to
apply.
i
would
note
that
medellin
also
presents
an
argument...
two
arguments
as
to
why
he's
presented
constitutional
claims.
one,
a
due-process
claim.
due
process
was
not
in
the
questions
presented,
as
he
authored.
it
was
not
in
the
brief
that
he
wrote
to
the
fifth
circuit
asking
for
a
coa.
the
words
"due
process"
do
not
appear
in
his
merits
briefs.
and,
indeed,
under
the
sections...
the
constitutional
sections
cited,
he
does
not
include
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
he
might
conceivably
have
brought
a
due-process
claim.
and
if
he
had
brought
a
due-process
claim,
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
considered
if
that
due-process
claim
met
the
substantive
standards
of
the
aedpa.
he
didn't
bring
a
due-process
claim.
he
brought
a
treaty
claim.
and
that's
the
question
upon
which
he
sought
certiorari
review
by
this
court.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but
225--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but
2253
is
a
jurisdictional
bar
to
this
court.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
because
he
didn't
bring
that
case.
sure,
there
are
dozens
of
constitutional
claims
he
could
have
brought
that
would
have
satisfied
2253.
he
didn't
bring
those
claims.
so
that's
not
presented
by
that
proceeding.
he's
not
entitled,
in
his
reply
brief,
to
say,
"well,
you
know,
we
could
have
brought
this
constitutional
claim.
"
given
that
he
did
not,
in
fact,
bring
that...
this
constitutional
claim.
if
medellin's
theory
is
adopted,
it
would
embrace
a
standard
beyond
fay
versus
noia.
thank
you.
