yes,
but
is
it
not
true
that
it's
entirely
possible
that
the
texas
proceeding
would
make
this
issue
moot--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and,
therefore,
avoid
the
necessity
for
deciding
a
lot
of
very
difficult
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
cruz,
let
me
just
make
a
suggestion.
assume
you
lose...
i'm
not
suggesting
you
will,
but
assume
you
do...
the
net
result
of
the
proceeding,
in
your
adversary's
favor,
would
be
that
they
would
get
a
hearing
in
the
state
court,
which
is
what...
the
president's
order
says,
"let
them
have
that
right
away.
"
so
the
whole
purpose
of
having
a
lot
of
federal
litigation
to
decide
what
you
can
address
right
away
by
honoring
the
president's
request,
at
least
litigating
it
in
the
state
court
right
away,
we
may
be
engaged
in
a
lot
of
useless
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
so
could
the
president's
order,
the
same
thing.
