justice

do
you
think...
do
you
think
that
the
president
can
enter
into
a
treaty,
with
the
approval
of
congress,
that
would
provide
that,
in
a
particular
combat,
the
commander
in
chief
will
be
somebody
other
than
the
president
of
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
the
constitution
provides
the
president
shall
be
commander
in
chief,
and,
therefore,
that
can't
be
given
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
well,
what
if
i
think
that
the
constitution
provides
that
all
questions
of
federal
law...
statutory,
treaty,
constitutional...
are
to
be
decided,
ultimately,
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
can
a
treaty
give
that
away?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
if
we're
bound
by
the
determination
of
avena.
it
does
if
i
have
to
believe
that
individual
rights
were
created
here,
without
reexamining
the
question
on
my
own.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
a
question
concerning
united
states
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
here
about
a
question
of
united
states
law,
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
treaty
that
the
united
states
has
entered
into?
do
you
know
another
case
where
we
have...
we
have
been
bound
by
a
judgement
of
a
foreign
court
or
an
international
court
concerning
the
meaning
of
united
states
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
not
an
interpretation
that
ousted
this
court
of
jurisdiction
over
the
matter,
though,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that's
a
little
bit
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't...
that
doesn't
involve
an
interpretation
of
the
treaty
that
is
rendered
by
somebody
else
and
that
is
binding
upon
this
court.
i
mean,
it's
just
a
matter
of
different
magnitude.
to
say
that
there
can
be
private
claims,
fine;
but
that
doesn't
say
that
the
interpretation
of
a
treaty
entered
into
the
by
the
united
states
is
subject
to
a
court,
other
than
this
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
the
president
doesn't
think
that
the
remedy
is
in
federal
habeas.
the
president
thinks
that
the
remedy
is
within
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
an
interesting
question.
let's
turn
from
the
more
cosmic
questions
into
how
you
overcome
the
impediment
that
in
order
to
get
a
certificate
of
appealability
here,
you
have
to
show
that
there
was...
you
have
to
make
a
substantial
showing
of
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right.
what
constitutional
right
has
been
denied
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
take--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
question
to
be
a
jurisdictional
question,
as
far
as
the
lower
court
is
concerned;
and,
therefore,
i
think
it's
a
jurisdictional
question
for
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
know
of
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
a
lower
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
but
we
do
have
jurisdiction
on
appeal
from
in
a...
from
a
court
that
didn't
have
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--had
jurisdiction
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
they
really
are
interesting,
you
know.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
how
many...
how
many
states
are
we
talking
about
for
these
51
individuals
involved
in
the
case?
how
many
different
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
conceivable
that
those
five
or
six
states
could
say,
"the
president
has
no
authority
to
do
this.
"
ground
one.
ground
two,
"even
if
he
did,
on
the
merits,
we
reexamine.
"
so
the
whole
thing
could
go
away.
