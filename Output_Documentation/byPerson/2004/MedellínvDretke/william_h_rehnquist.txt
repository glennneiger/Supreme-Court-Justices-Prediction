argument
now
in
no.
04-5928,
jose
medellin
versus
doug
dretke.
mr.
donovan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ordinarily
do
not
think
of
that
as
covered
in
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think...
i
think
granting
a
stay
could
be
seen
as
validating
the
position
of
the
government
without
ever
having
an
opinion
on
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
creation
of
a
private
right
of
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
courts...
the
courts
usually
do
that,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
speak
to
the
private
right
of
action--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
but
in
that
case
it
was
overseeing
arrangements
that
were
made
by
our
government,
not...
they
didn't
have
that
much
local
authority.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--doesn't
the
president,
in
dames
&
moore,
enter
into
an
agreement
with
iran?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
decided,
in
dames
&
moore,
that
he
was
acting
pursuant
to
the
agreement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
didn't--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--we
didn't
decide
it
on
the
basis
that
president
reagan
says,
"this
is
what
in
particular
the
agreement
affected.
"
we
examined
it
for
ourselves.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you're
talking
about
denial
of
a
right
that
didn't
exist.
that
seems
perfectly
rational,
the
way
you
put
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
right
didn't
exist,
it
should
have
been
denied.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
donovan.
mr.
cruz,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
treaty,
by
its
own
force,
did
not
create
enforceable
individual
rights,
then
we
would
have
to
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
president's
proclamation
changes
that
result.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
seems
to
be
topsy-turvy,
that
a
treaty
would
have
effect
in
state
courts
but
not
in
federal
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cruz.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
donovan,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

you,
mr.
donovan.
the
case
is

justice
william
h.
rehnquist

the
court

announce

medellin
versus
dretke.

the
reason
