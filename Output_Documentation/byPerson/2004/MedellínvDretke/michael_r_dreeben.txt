mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
the
reasons
articulated
in
the
brief
for
the
united
states
and
by
the
state
of
texas,
this
court
should
conclude
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
lower
court
to
issue
of
certificate
of
appealability;
and,
therefore,
the
court
should
not
reach
the
many
questions
that
petitioner
has
raised
in
this
case
about
the
effect
of
the
avena
judgement.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
have
been
cases
in
the
circuits,
justice
kennedy,
that
have
held
that
once
a
coa
has
issued,
the
court
of
appeals
may
consider
a
claim
that
would
otherwise
be
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
but
this
is
a
case
where
a
coa
has
not
been
issued,
and
there
is
a
plain
procedural
obstacle
to
its
issuance
that
this
court
can
determine
and,
therefore,
obviate
the
need
to
consider
the
very
sensitive
and
delicate
questions
that
petitioner
has
raised.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor,
because
a
coa
is
a
jurisdictional
requirement.
and
just
as
a
notice
of
appeal
is
a
jurisdictional
requirement
and
the
prerequisites
for
proper
notice
of
appeal
have
to
be
satisfied,
the
prerequisites
for
a
proper
certificate
of
appealability
should
be
satisfied
before
this
court
goes
on
to
reach
the
merits
of
a
question,
which,
as
justice
stevens
has
pointed
out,
may
never
need
to
be
reached
at
all
if
the
texas
courts
recognize
the
president's
determination
with
respect
to
the
avena
decision
or
apply
the
avena
decision
itself.
and
i
think
it's
very
noteworthy
that
the
filing
that
petitioner
made
at
the
end
of
last
week
in
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
seeking
a
successive
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
under
texas
law
specifically,
at
page
25,
says
that
petitioner
is
relying
on
the
avena
judgement
and
he's
relying
on
the
president's
determination,
which
are
two
new
sources
of
law
that
were
not
available
at
the
time
the
texas
courts
previously
addressed
the
matter
and
that
now
are
available,
which
constitutes
a
ground
for
a
second
petition
under
texas
law,
and
that,
accordingly,
the
texas
courts
should
allow
this
claim
to
be
developed
in
the
state
courts
and
to
be
litigated
there.
to
me,
those
statements
are
almost
an
admission
that
the
claims
that
petitioner
has
brought
here
are
barred
by
failure
to
exhaust
available
state
remedies.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
do
think
that
the
court
would
have
the
option
of
availing
itself
of
extraordinary
jurisdiction,
but,
as
the
court
made
clear
in
the
felker
case,
its
exercise
of
extraordinary
original
writs
would
be
informed
by
the
limitations
that
the
aedpa
imposes
upon
the
grant
of
habeas
corpus
relief;
and,
therefore,
the
court
should
look
to
at
least
the
additional
jurisdictional
obstacle
that
the
united
states
and
texas
has
raised;
and,
namely,
that
is
that
the
decision
that
the
texas
courts
raised...
issued
in
this
case
is
not
contrary
to
any
supreme
court
decision
or
a
misapplication
of
any
clearly
established
federal
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
should
hold
the
case,
pending
the
outcome
of
the
texas
proceedings.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
texas
proceedings
can
consider
the
avena
claim
and
the
claim
in
reliance--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
supreme
court
would
have
the
option
of
granting
cert
to
review
whatever
the
texas
courts--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it
would
be
close
to
issuing
an
advisory
opinion
for
the
court
to
decide
an
important
issue
of
federal
law
in
which
there
is
a
clear
jurisdictional
bar
to
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
of
appealability,
and
i
don't
think
that
a
treatise
creates
enough
of
a
doubt
that
aedpa,
means
"constitutional"
for
this
court
to
embark
on
a
wide-ranging
exploration
of
potentially
very
significant
issues
with
constitutional
overtones.
the
avena
decision
is
not
a
freestanding
source
of
law
that
can
be
administered
by
this
court
wholly
apart
from
the
president's
determination.
what
the
president
did
was
to
determine
not
that
the
treaty
has
a
particular
meaning
that
favors
petitioner's
case,
but
that,
as
a
matter
of
compliance
with
the
obligation
of
the
united
states,
under
international
law,
to
comply
with
a
judgement
of
the
international
court
of
justice...
or
to
determine
not
to...
but
that,
in
the
interest
of
the
rule
of
law
and
the
obligations
that
were
taken
on,
the
president
would
create
a
new
source
of
law,
in
effect,
that
would
enable
the
enforcement
of
that
particular
judgement,
without
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
underlying
merits
determination
that
the
icj
made.
but
if
this
court
were
to
treat
the
icj
judgement
as
a
freestanding
source
of
law,
it
would
frustrate
the
executive's
ability
to
determine,
in
a
particular
case,
this
determination
by
an
international
tribunal
should
not
be
enforced
and
it
should
not
be
given
effect;
rather,
that
the
president
might,
in
a
particular
case,
choose
to...
not
to
comply
with
that
determination.
and
it
would
rob
the
president
of
that
freedom
in
international
affairs
were
this
court
to
treat
a
determination
by
the
international
court
of
justice
as
a
freestanding--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is,
justice
o'connor,
but
it
should...
properly
construed
as
not
conferring
privately-enforceable
rights
on
a
criminal
defendant
in
a
criminal
case.
it
has
not
one
word
about
private
enforceability
in
a
criminal
case
in
its
language.
the
backdrop
of
the
vienna
convention
was
that
no
country
had
ever
provided
notice
of
rights
to
a
criminal
defendant
that
would
then
form
a
basis,
in
the
event
of
a
violation,
of
an
attack
on
a
criminal
conviction.
state
practice
since
the
vienna
convention
has
not
recognized,
here
or
abroad,
a
privately-enforceable
right--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
number,
justice
scalia.
i
think
it's
five
or
six
states
that
have
defendants
that
are
at
issue
in
those
proceedings.
and
what
the
president
determined
was,
with
respect
to
those
51
individuals,
observance
of
the
icj
judgement
was
warranted,
as
a
matter
of
united
states
foreign
policy,
not
because
the
united
states
agrees
with
the
icj's
rulings.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
absolutely
correct.
and
i
think
that's
an
additional
reason
why
this
court
should
not
rush
ahead
and
overlook
jurisdictional
obstacles
that
may
not
have
been
apparent
to
it
at
the
time
that
it
granted
certiorari,
and
certainly
the
court
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
fact
that
the
president
would
make
a
determination
that
state
courts
should
provide
the
review
and
reconsideration
that
the
icj
had
determined
was
appropriate.
and
the
court,
of
course,
didn't
know
that
petitioner
would
then
file
a
petition
for
successive
writ
in
the
texas
courts
that
could
provide
him
the
review
and
reconsideration
that
he
now
seeks
this
court
to
announce
in
a
ruling
that
would
have
extraordinarily
broad
and
detrimental
foreign-policy
consequences
for
the
united
states'
freedom
to
respond
to
the
decisions
of
international
tribunals
in
a
manner
that
the
president
sees
fit
in
accordance
with
his
foreign-policy
judgement.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
