justice
david
h.
souter
well,
your
position,
i
take
it,
is
that
if
somehow
we
follow
your
suggestion
so
that
the
president's
suggestion
may
be
put
into
effect
in
the
state
courts,
that
there
would
still
be
a
habeas
jurisdiction,
ultimately,
over
the
result
if
you're
dissatisfied
with
what
happens
in
texas.
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
simply
saying
that
any
court
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
its
jurisdiction.
we
grant
you
that.
but,
granted
that,
if
we
reach
it,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
claim
that
the
coa
requires
a
showing
of
substantial
infringement
of
constitutional,
as
distinct
from
other
sources
of,
rights?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
constitutional
violation
is
the
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
due
process
clause
because?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
of
course,
we
wouldn't
even
have
to
venture
into...
possibly
have
to
venture
into
this
issue
of
law
if
texas
were
interested
in
following
the
determination
of
the
president.
i
take
it
that
the
suggestion
that
your
brother
has
made,
that,
in
fact,
we
take
no
action
at
this
point
so
that
they
may
return
to
texas
with
the
president's
determination,
is
not
appealing
to
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
does
texas
have
a
position
in
response
to
the
president's
determination?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
we
don't...
we
may
not
reach
that,
if
texas
says,
"well,
yes,
you're
right,
it
is
a
claim,
and
we'll
entertain
it.
"
does
texas
have
a
position
on
that
question
yet?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
sure
it
will
be,
but
does
texas
have
a
position
on
that,
at
this
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
difference
does
that
make,
since
this...
the
issue
to
which
it
is
addressed
has
not
been
raised
either?
i
mean,
it's
a
new
issue,
and
i
presume,
to
the
extent
that
it
may
be
considered
at
all,
his
response...
he
can
make
a
response
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
can
understand
the
argument,
that
he
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
raise
due
process
here
if
the
argument
also
goes
to
your...
the
permissibility
of
your
raising
2253.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
sauce
for
the
goose--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
then
i
don't
see
why
it
isn't
also
a
jurisdictional
gate
for
him
to
make
a
response
to
it.
