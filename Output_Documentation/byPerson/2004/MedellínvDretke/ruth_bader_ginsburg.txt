but
is
it
right...
i
mean,
you
couldn't...
you
could
not...
unless
the
icj
decision
gave
a
right
to
an
individual,
and
you
had
no
claim
under
the
federal
habeas
statute...
and
it
is
unusual,
is
it
not,
for
a
judgement
of
the
international
court
of
justice
to
recognize
the
right
of
an
individual,
as
opposed
to
being
just
a
judgement
between
nations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many...
how
many
times
has
the
icj
held
that,
that
a
treaty,
apart
from
being
contract
between
the
signers,
confers
individual
rights?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
individual
in
that
case.
that
was
a
case
of
one
nation
against
another.
there
was
no
individual,
like
the
plaintiff
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
what
i
asked,
if
this...
i
know
that,
certainly
in
the
context
of
the
vienna
convention,
there
have
been
the
series
of
decisions
you
mentioned;
but
i
was
wondering
whether,
outside
the
vienna
convention,
there
has
been
any
similar
judgement
of
the
icj
that
operates
directly
on
individuals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
answer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
related...
the
related
question
that...
well,
assuming
the
vienna
convention
is
certainly
law,
and
treaty
stands
on
the
same
footing
as
law,
but
i
believe
that
the...
texas
and
the
government
have
said
the
aedpa
statute
is
the
later-in-time
provision,
and
when
you
have
two
provisions
with
a
statute
treaty,
the
later-in-time
prevails.
so
why
did...
why
isn't
the
aedpa
controlling,
and
not
the
vienna
convention?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said...
you
said
that
something
has
started
in
the
texas
courts.
we
have
the
motion
to
stay
this
case,
and
your
response
that
it
shouldn't
be
stayed,
that
we
should
decide
this
case.
but
what
is
going
on,
at
this
moment,
in
the
texas
courts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
after
the
texas
court
stays
its
hand,
then
what
action
is
asked?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
breard
case
speak
to
that
issue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
what
the
president's
memorandum
says
exactly
what
the
avena
judgement
said?
that
is,
the
president
said,
"well,
the
icj
said
that
these
people
are
entitled
to
review
and
reconsideration
of
their
guilt
and
of
their
punishment.
"
"and
so,
i
think
that's
what
should
happen.
"
"i
agree
with
the
judgement,
or
at
least
i
think
it
should
be
enforced,
and
the
only
place
it
can
be
enforced
is
in
the
state
court
that
rendered
the
judgement,
because
the
icj
said
what
the
united
states
has
to
implement
is,
they
have
to
give
a
review
and
reconsideration.
"
now,
i
suppose,
as
far
as
the
icj
is
concerned,
they
don't
care
if
it's
done
by
some
federal
tribunal,
or
state,
but
within
our
system,
it
must
be
the
state,
mustn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
can't
be,
in
light
of
the
united
states'
most
recent
action.
i
mean,
we
have
a
judgement.
the
judgement
concerns
how
many
people?
fifty-one?
forty-nine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
there
is
no
judgement
concerning
anybody
else.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this...
but
if
there's
a
claim
here
based
on
the
avena
judgement,
it
is
that
the
united
states
agreed
to
the
icj's
jurisdiction
in
vienna
convention
cases.
and
so,
pursuant
to
that
agreement,
there
was
an
adjudication.
the
united
states
is
no
longer
agreeing,
so
there
will
never
be
another
adjudication.
this
adjudication
concerns
51
people
or...
and
there
are
no
others.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
have
to...
you
have
to
recognize
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
this
case,
which
is,
in
large
part,
based
on
a
judgement
of
the
icj,
and
other
cases
that
would
not
have
the
benefit
of
that
judgement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
this...
the
united
states
did
consent
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
icj
in
these
vienna
convention
cases,
and
that
tribunal
issued
a
judgement.
why
doesn't
it
get
the
same
recognition
and
enforcement
of
any
judgement
of
any
court
with
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
could
this
question
of
the
effect
of
the
avena
treaty
be
brought
before
the
court?
mr.
donovan
raised,
i
think,
the
all
writs
act,
and
he
also
raised
original
writs
in
this
court.
if
the
coa
doesn't
work,
then
treat
this...
i
think
that's
what
he's
saying...
treat
it
as
though
it
were
an
application
under
the
all
writs
act
or
an
original
writ.
