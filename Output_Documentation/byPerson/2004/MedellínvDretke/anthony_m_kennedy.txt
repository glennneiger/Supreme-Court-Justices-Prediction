justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
can
the
president
give
an
interpretation
of
the
treaty
unilaterally
that
is
binding
on
us?
can
the
president
sign
a
treaty
and
then,
a
year
later,
give
an
interpretation
of
that
treaty
that's
binding
on
us,
insofar
as
what
the
treaty
means?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
he
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
i
would
say
that
that,
ultimately,
is
for
this
court.
then,
if
that's
so,
how
can
he
agree
with
the...
to
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
world
court,
which
would
do
the
same
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what's
the
case
that
you're
citing
for
this
proposition,
that
the
president
and
the
senate
can,
in
effect,
confer
on
an
international
tribunal
the
obligation
to
bind
this
court
with
reference
to
an
interpretation
of
a
treaty?
what's
the
best
case
you've
got
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
telling
me
you
don't
have
a
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
we
can't
forego
limits
on
our
jurisdiction
simply
by
granting
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
say,
"oh,
you've
granted
a
question;
therefore,
you
have
to
decide
whether
you
have
jurisdiction
or
not.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
see?
and,
as
justice
scalia
indicates,
the
coa
is
a
jurisdictional
requirement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
was
my
next...
my
question,
and
it
follows
on
the
question
justice
souter
asked.
does
the
attorney
general
concede,
or
do
you
not,
or
acknowledge
that
there
are
texas
procedures
in
which
these
questions
can
be
litigated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
it
also
true
that,
in
the
texas
proceedings,
they
necessarily
would
involve
a
federal
question
on
which
this
court
could,
if
it
chose,
grant
certiorari
on
direct
review?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
there
been
any
cases
in
the
circuits
holding
that
the
state
can
waive
the
jurisdictional
limitation
on
coa?
