paul

we'll
now
hear
argument
in
spector
against
the
norwegian
cruise
line.
mr.
goldstein.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i...
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
your
case
really
isn't
limited
to
cruise
ships.
it's
limited
to
ships
that
come
into...
passenger
ships,
which
would
include
the
queen
mary
and
queen
elizabeth,
all
the
rest
of
them.
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
fact
that
it's
based
in
miami
or
it
had
mostly
american
customers
really
is
not
relevant
to
the
legal
issue.
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
they
would
have
been
aware
of
those
that
are
also
less
american
in
their
patronage
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
we're
not
necessarily
thinking
of
a
cruise
ship,
just
the
transatlantic
liner
that
goes
from
liverpool
to
miami
or
something.
that
would
be
covered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
goldstein,
there's
another
aspect
that
troubles
me.
your
view,
as
i
understand,
only
applies
while
the
ship
is
in
american
waters
so
that
if,
for
example,
you
complain
about
the
training
for
a
safety
drill,
if
they
conducted
those
after
they'd
gone
out
20
miles
to
sea,
there
would
be...
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the...
the
statue.
would
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
i'm
trying
to
understand.
you
don't
know
what
your
position
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
respect
to
what
would
otherwise
be
violations
of
the
statute
that
occur
on
the
high
seas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i
think
we
should...
the
cruise
ships
are
entitled
to
know
whether
they
may
freely
discriminate
against
people
in
the
casinos
and
so
forth
when
they're
on
the
high
seas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
view
is
not
limited
to
what
happens
in
the
territorial
waters.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
salmons,
may
i
ask
before
you
begin
whether
the
united
states
agrees
that
the
statute
would
apply
to
the
activities
of
these
ships
when
they're
on
the
high
seas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
if
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
you're
on
a
round
trip
ticket
from
liverpool
to
miami
and
back,
it
would
depend
on
where
you
bought
the
ticket.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
salmons.
mr.
frederick.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frederick,
that
brings
up
a
question
i've
been
meaning
to
ask
you.
to
what
extent
was
this
whole
problem
of
the
application
of
this
statute
to
the
foreign
vessels
discussed
in
the
legislative
history
of
these
statutes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr....
may
i
ask
this
question
to
you?
what
about
a...
an
american-flagged
ship?
does
the
statute
apply
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
view?
not
what
arguments
can
be
made.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
really,
we're
not
concerned
with
the
fact
this
is
a
foreign
flagged
ship.
you're
concerned
with
the
fact
it's
a
ship.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
it...
on
the
other...
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
apart
from
the
structural
problem...
and
i
understand
the
arguments
on
both
sides
there.
with
respect
to
things
like
safety
drills
and
access
to
gambling
tables
and
all
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
to
that
would
be,
well,
we'll
just
do
that
once
we're
on
the
high
seas
so
there's
no
conflict
with
the
statute
when
we're
out
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
garre.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
about
40
seconds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
the
case
is
submitted.
