mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
congressional
intent
not
congressional
power.
congress
undoubtedly
has
the
power--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
it
was
not
the
fullest
extent
of
the
commerce
power.
that
statute
was
at
issue
in
this
court's
case
concerning
the
lanham
act
where
the
court
said
that
a
violation
of
the
lanham
act
that
occurred
in
mexico
but
had
an
effect
in
the
united
states
was
intended
to
be
covered
by
congress
because
that
commerce
clause,
justice
souter,
did
state
to
the
fullest
extent
of
congress'
power
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
this
statute
does
not
say
that.
this
statute
talks
about
commerce
in
and
between
states
and
territories,
and
it
is
much
closer
to
the
statute
language
that
this
court
addressed
in
the
aramco
case
where--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
there
are
slight
differences
in
the
language,
but
i
don't
think
that's
dispositive
because
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act,
which
this
court
addressed
in
the
aramco
case,
the
court...
the
chief
justice's
opinion
there
said
that
that
language
was
not
enough
to
express
the
intent.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it's
all
a
question
of
congressional
intent,
justice
ginsburg,
and
there's
no
indication
of
an
intent
that
congress
needed
to
address
any
problem
that
arose
with
respect
to
that
form
of
discrimination.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
there
would
be
no
u.s.
congressional
statute
that
would
address
that,
justice
ginsburg.
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
bahamian
constitution
which
prohibits--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--as
i
said,
i'm
not
aware
that
there
has
ever
been
an
instance
of
that
in
the
cruise
industry.
congress
has
not
addressed
that.
we're
talking
about
foreign
ships
here.
and
i
want
to
get
back
to
the
structural
features
of
the
ship
because
the
ada
fundamentally--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
o'connor,
our
position
is
that
congress
has
not
spoken
to
the
question,
and
so
there
is
no
congressional
statute
that
is
on
point.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
our
position
is
that
it
can't
discriminate
because
a
different
law
proscribes
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
ginsburg,
as
i
said,
congress
has
not
extended
its
laws
to
the
full
reach
of
u.s.
territorial
power,
and
this
court
has
maintained
that
position
ever
since
the
charming
betsy
case
200
years
ago,
the
schooner
exchange
case,
and
brown
v.
duchesne.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
what
you
say,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
clear
statement
canon
requires
congress
to
say
when
it
intends
to
apply
a
law
to
a
foreign
vessel.
congress
didn't
do
that.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
you
do,
justice
kennedy.
and
just
as
this
court
in
the
aramco
case
said
that
title
vii
doesn't
apply
to
the
foreign...
work
in
a
foreign
land
by
an
american
company
of
an
american--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
kennedy,
congress
hasn't
extended
criminal
laws
of
the
united
states
to
the
full
reach
of
u.s.
power.
it
is
only
proscribed
15
offenses
that
will
apply
in
the
special
maritime
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
approximately
two
thirds
to
three
quarters
in
any
given
year.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
majority
of
them
do.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
ginsburg,
there...
all
of
those
questions
are
going
to
be
answered
as
a
predominant
marketing
effort,
et
cetera
is
directed
to
the
u.s.
market.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
the
reason,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
that
law
imposes
structural
changes
on
vessels
that
go
to
other
ports.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
are
talking--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
court
could
certainly
carve
out
in
its
clear...
articulation
of
the
clear
statement
principle
some
of
these
lines.
it
becomes
very--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
o'connor,
congress,
when
it
talked
about
readily
achievable,
did
so
in
terms
of
cost.
it
didn't
do
so
in
terms
of
conflict
with
the
laws
of
other
nations
or--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
that's
completely
false.
in...
in
the
year
2000,
the
united
states
government
issued
a
report
that
contained
an
extensive
appendix,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
that
details
in
laborious
detail
the
conflicts
between
land
based
ada
standards
and
solas.
now,
i
can
give
you
some
specifics,
if
you
would...
that
are
fairly
practical,
such
as
the
ada
requires
under
the
interpretation
advanced
by
the
petitioners
that
there
be
a
disabled
access
cabin
on
every
level
of
the
ship,
but
solas
requires
that
passengers
with
disabilities
be
placed
near
evacuation
points.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
kennedy,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
categorically
deny
the
claims
of
discrimination
here.
we're
having
to
fight
this
on
the
basis
of
assuming
the...
the
allegations
are
true,
but
they
are
categorically
false.
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
ginsburg,
what
the
other
side
wants
is
a
case
by
case
method
of
decision
making
in
which
a
district
judge
becomes
the
special
master
of
the
cruise
industry
so
that
each
claim
of
discrimination
that
would
require
some
modification
to
the
ship--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
that's
why,
justice
kennedy,
it's
a
question
of
congressional
intent.
the
very
same
congress
debated
extensively
about
whether
to
impose
design
requirements
on
foreign
ships
in
the
oil
pollution
act
of
1990,
and
it
decided
to
buck
the
international
system
knowingly
by
imposing
a
design
requirement
that
double
hulls
be
imposed
on
oil
tankers,
foreign
oil
tankers.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
zero.
there
is
not
one
word
about
vessel--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
it
was
encroaching
on
an
area
of
foreign
sovereignty.
foreign
ships
are
governed
by
foreign
laws.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
european
law
on
charging
of
an
additional
price,
but
i
would
point
out
that
pricing,
like
evacuation
procedures,
do
go
to
the
structure
of
the
vessel.
and
we're
talking
here
fundamentally
in
the
ada
about
structural
changes
that
they
want
to
impose
that
go...
when
ships
travel,
they
can't
dismantle
those
structural
changes
when
they
leave
u.s.
waters.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
the
fifth
circuit
reserved
that
question.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
our
view
is
that
there
are
arguments
that
can
be
made
that
it
does
not
because
congress
didn't--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i
think--
[laughter]
no.
i
think
our
view
is
that
it
doesn't.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
does
not
apply
because
congress
didn't
express
the
intent.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the...
there's
a
difference
and...
and
there
are
about
1,000
u.s.
flagged
ships
that
carry
passengers,
so
that
if
congress
had
given
any
thought
to
the
question,
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
it
might
have
distinguished
between
u.s.
ships
for
which
u.s.
law
directly
governs
and
foreign
ships
that
are
governed
by
a
different
law.
the
fact--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
there
aren't
any
words
in
the
statute
that
go
to
ships.
the
best
they
can
do
is
a
catchall
phrase
at
the
end
of
bus,
rail,
and
any
other
means
of
conveyance.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
it's
not--
[laughter]
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--with
respect
to
foreign
ships,
there
is
a
clear
statement
rule
and
that
clear
statement
rule
is
embodied
in
the
fact
that
a
foreign
ship
is
governed
by
the
law
of
the
flag
state
where
it
is
registered.
that's
been
the
rule
for
200
years.
and
the
other
side's
position--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
it's
been
articulated
in
several
different
contexts.
in
the
brown
v.
duchesne
case,
the
court
150
years
ago
articulated
in
a
patent
case
where
the
court
said
that
a
patented
device
on
the
ship,
which
was
the
french
ship
in
boston
harbor
infringing
an
american
patentholder,
would
not
apply
u.s.
patent
law.
and
the
court
said,
because
we
can't
conceive
that
congress
would
have
imagined
this
general
language
to
encroach
on
the
sovereignty
of
a
foreign
ship.
now,
the
other
side
has
exactly
two
sentences
to
say
about
that
case,
but
that
is
the
case
that
is
directly
on
point
because
that
case
says
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
american
laws
that
are
generally
written,
you
would
not
ordinarily
apply
them
to
a
foreign
ship
unless
congress
said
so
specifically.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
justice
souter,
you
have
a
foreign
ship
owned
by
a
foreign
corporation
built
in
a
foreign
country
under
foreign
engineering
standards--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--for
a
time
before
that
ship
moves
into
another
market.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
just
the
same
way
that
mcculloch
the
court
said
that
labor
standards
for
a
course
of
business
that
is
regular
between
honduras
and
the
united
states
is
not
going
to
be
sufficient
to
apply--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
were.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
a
choice
of
law
clause,
justice
ginsburg,
has
never
been
held
to
incorporate
law
in
the
sense
that
laws
that
don't
apply
are
going
to
be
incorporated.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
choice
of
law
clause
that...
that
simply
takes
in
every
domestic
statute.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and...
and
you
would
have...
under
their
theory,
you
would
have
the
consumer
products
safety
act,
the
food
and
drug
act,
osha,
all
sorts
of
other
statutes
of
general
application
that
are
now
going
to
be
imposed
on
foreign
vessels
simply
because
they
do
a
lot
of
business
in
the
united
states.
the
problem
here,
as
a
matter
of
congressional
intent,
is
we
don't
know
what
congress
thought
about
this,
and
because
congress--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
the
internal
operations
of
the
ship,
justice
kennedy,
is
part
and
parcel
of
how
it
is
designed,
what
are
the
evacuation
points,
how
are
the
cabins
laid
out,
what
ramps
are
placed
where,
how...
everything
about
the
ship's
design--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
doesn't...
justice
kennedy,
the
problem
with
that
theory
is
it
just
doesn't
comport
with
the
language
of...
of
the
statute.
congress
didn't
think
in
terms
of...
as
it
did
in
the
oil
pollution
act,
it
said,
if
there's
a
conflict
with
international
law,
work
it
out.
get
the
coast
guard
with
the
foreign
nations
and
work
out
the
conflict.
it
didn't
put
anything
like
that
in
this
statute,
which
is
a
further
indication
that
if
congress
wants
to
extend
this
kind
of
disability
protection,
it
can
do
that,
but
it
ought
to
do
so
willingly.
and
the
government
has
had
13
years
to
come
up
with
rules
that
would
govern
cruise
ships,
and
the
best
they've
done,
a
few
days
before
the
top
side
briefs
in
this
case
were
filed,
is
to
issue
proposed
draft
guidelines
for
ferries,
not
cruise
ships.
most
of
the
regulations
that
they
are
pointing
to
wouldn't
have
an
application
to
a
large
passenger
cruise
ship.
if
congress
wants
to
change
this,
it
certainly
has
the
power,
but
this
court
need
not
open
up
a
pandora's
box
of
domestic
legislation
to
apply
to
foreign
ships
where
congress
has
not
expressed
the
intent
to
do
that.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
i
don't
perceive
a
limiting
principle
to
the
other
side's
position.
in
fact,
there's
an
amicus
brief
written
where
there's
only
one
or
two
stops
in
the
united
states
a
year,
and
under
their
view,
that
ship
would
be
governed
by
the
ada
as
well.
if...
if
congress
wants
to
enact
these
limits,
it's
certainly
free
to
do
so,
but
this
is
a
highly
complex
area
and
ships
are
different
from
land
based
accommodations
because
you
have
to
be
able
to
evacuate
people
within
30
minutes.
and
so
when
we
train
people,
we
have--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
stevens,
we
give
evacuation
drills
to
the
disabled
in
a
different
way.
we
have
special
access
and
assistance
squads
that
go
to
persons
with
physical
challenges
to
get
them
off
the
vessel
in
an
event
of
a...
a
need
for
evacuation.
that's
a
different
procedure
than
most
passengers,
but
it's...
it
is
one
that
is
in
place.
