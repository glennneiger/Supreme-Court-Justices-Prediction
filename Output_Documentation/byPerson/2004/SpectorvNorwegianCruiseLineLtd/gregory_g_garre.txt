mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
applying
title
iii
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
to
foreign
flagged
vessels
would
invite
precisely
the
sort
of
international
discord,
conflict,
and
confusion
that
congress
presumably
seeks
to
avoid
when
it
writes
american
laws.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
ginsburg,
first
let
me
make
clear
that
the
bahamian
government
does
and
all
of
its
cruise
vessels
are
governed
by
that
prohibition.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
think
that
that
question
can
be
resolved
along
the
lines
that
justice
scalia
suggested,
which
is
that
when
you're
dealing
with
a
matter
that
goes
to
the
internal
affairs
of
the
ship...
and
there...
we
would
suggest
that
there
is
more
central
to
the
internal
affairs
of
the
ship
than
its
construction
and
design.
under
international
law,
article
94
of
the
law
of...
law
of
the
sea
convention,
which
the
bahamian
government
has
ratified...
and
by
the
way,
the
united
states
has
not,
and
that's
an
important
principle
for
this
court
to
keep
in
mind...
foreign
flagged
states
may
be
bound
by
different
international
treaties
than
the
united
states.
simply
trying
to
draw
some
conflict
resolution
device
that
would
deal
with
treaties
that
the
united
states
has
entered
into,
international
nations
have
not
will
not
address
that
problem.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no.
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
our
principle
is
that
when
it
comes
to
the
matters
that
under
international
law
have
been
traditionally
governed
by
the
flag
state,
then
when
congress
writes
its
laws,
we
presume
that
unless
congress
clearly
indicates
an
affirmative
intention
to
address
those
matters,
it
did
not
intend
to.
when
congress
wrote
the
ada,
not
a
word
of
the
statute
indicates
that
it
considered
the
international
repercussions
of
applying
that
law
to
foreign
flagged
vessels.
not
a
word--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
souter,
first
of
all,
it's...
it...
the
statute
doesn't
say
full
sweep.
it
says
sweep,
and
that's
in
the
findings
of
the
ada.
it's
reprinted
on
page
32
of
petitioners'
brief.
and
second
of
all,
the
definition
of
congress,
which
doesn't
contain
that
sweep
language,
is
almost
identical
to
the
definition
of
commerce
in
mcculloch,
which
is
on
page
15,
note
3
of
that
decision,
and
that
definition,
the
united
states
argued
in
the
mcculloch
case,
was
not
sufficient
to
extend
u.s.
labor
laws
to
foreign
flagged
vessels.
it's
important
to
understand
the...
the
potential
international
conflicts
that
extending
the
ada
to
foreign
flagged
vessels
could
create.
there
are
more
than
40
nations
that
have
adopted
anti
discrimination
laws
for
the
disabled.
three
nations
have...
have
adopted
laws
for
domestic
vessels:
britain,
canada,
and
australia.
if
a
country
like
the
united
states
extended
its
laws
to
foreign
vessels
that
entered
its
ports,
then
other
nations
may
well
follow
suit.
and
if
you
take
a
simple
hypothetical
example,
the
queen
mary
ii
traveling
from
south
hampton
to
new
york,
if
you
look
at
the
guidelines
that
britain
has
adopted
for
domestic
vessels,
those
guidelines
contain
different
structural
and
design
requirements
than
the
draft
guidelines
that
the
united
states
have
promulgated.
there
are
different
requirements
for
door
widths.
there
are
different
requirements
for
sloping.
there's
different
requirements
for
the
watertight
compartments.
there
are
different
requirements
about
whether
vessels
have
to
be...
have
accessible
cabins
all
throughout
the
ship.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
scalia,
i
think
in
some
you
could
and
in
others
you
couldn't.
and...
and
that's
an
important...
important
point.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes,
your...
yes,
your
honor.
and...
and
in
many
cases,
it's
not
going
to
be
clear
which
regulation
is
going
to
be
more
accommodating
to
the
disabled
and
which
is
not.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
don't
think
so,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
would
take
the
same
approach
that
this
court
emphasized
in...
in
the
mcculloch
case,
which
is
that
kind
of
ad
hoc
balancing
analysis
would
wreak
havoc
for
the
question
whether
a
significant
regulation
like
the
ada
would
apply
to
a
vessel.
how
would
foreign
vessels
know,
when
they
enter
u.s.
ports,
whether
they
have
to
undertake
the
extraordinary
changes--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
breyer,
the
way
that
those
issues
are
worked
out
in
the
international
shipping
context
is
through
the
international
maritime
organization.
this
organization
has
been
responsible
for
crafting
scores
of
conventions,
hundreds
of
shipping
codes,
and
it's
already
begun
to
address
the
issue
of
accessibility
on
ships
for
the
disabled
and
the
elderly.
we
cite
the
1996
guidelines
in
our
brief.
those
guidelines
right
now
are...
are
not
binding
guidelines,
but
they
could
well
become
binding
guidelines.
and
when
an
organization
like
the
imo
addresses
this
question,
it
resolves--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we
don't
think
the
readily
achievable
language
in
the
first
case
in
any
way
contemplates
conflicts
with
international
law.
this
court
has
a
separate
canon
that's
almost
as
old
as
the
country
that
it
presumes
congress
doesn't
intend
to
interfere
with
international
obligations
or
international
laws,
including
customary
international
law,
as
you
wrote
for
the
court
last
term
in...
in
the
empagran
case.
we
presume
that
american
legislatures
give
respect
to
the
interests
of
sovereign
nations
when
they
write
their
laws,
and
we
don't
assume
that
congress
intends
to
intrude
on
the
sovereign
interests
of
other
nations.
and
that's
what
extending
the
ada
to
foreign
flagged
ships
would
do.
the
bahamian
government
has
a
solemn
responsibility
under
international
law
and
under
its
own
law
to
govern
the
construction
and
design
of
all
flags
of
all
ships
that
fly...
fly
its
flags.
article
10
of
the
geneva
convention
on
the
high
seas
recognizes
that
flag
states
have
responsibility
for
the
construction
and
design
of
ships.
article
94
of
the
law
of
the
sea
conventions
specifies
that
flag
states
have
responsibility
over
administrative,
technical,
and
labor
matters,
including
construction
and
design
matters.
these
are
precisely
the
sorts
of
matters
that
for
centuries
the
flag
state
has
been
responsible
for.
and
in
the
brown
v.
duchesne
case,
this
court
recognized
that,
a
case
that
dealt
with
the
application
of
patent
laws
to
the
construction
and
design
of
a
foreign
flagged
vessels.
there
are
going
to
be
conflicts
within...
between
international
law
and
the
requirements
of
the
ada,
but
first
of
all,
there's
going
to
be
confusion.
it's
been
more
than
a
decade
since
the
ada
was
passed,
and
we
don't
even
have
final
regulations
as
to
what
rules
apply.
and
in
the
meantime,
foreign
flagged
vessels
are
going
to
have
to
be
reviewing
the
case
law
in
the
united
states
courts,
determining
on
a
vessel
by
vessel,
design
specification
by
design
specification
as
to
what
standards
apply.
that's
only
going
to
create
additional
international
discord
and
confusion.
petitioners
proposed
solution
to
this
problem
we
think
is
telling.
they
urge
this
court
in
their
reply
brief
if
there
is
a
problem
after
the
ada
is
extended
to
foreign
flagged
ships
and
other
nations
begin
to
follow
suit
and
you
have
a
crazy
made...
maze
of
different
regulations
applying
to
construction
and
design,
then
at
that
point,
the
united
states
can
go
to
the
imo
and
ask
it
to
clean
up
the
mess.
with
respect,
we
think
they
have
it
backwards.
the
purpose
of
the
imo
and
the
international
framework
that
exists
for
governing
regulation
of
shipping
is
to
establish
a
uniform
set
of
rules
in
the
first
instance.
the
imo
has
already
begun
to
address
the
problem
at
issue
in
this
case,
accessibility
for
the
disabled.
they
are
available
to
address
that
in
a
multilateral
fashion.
and
congress,
in
enacting
the
ada,
gave
no
indication
that
it
weighed
any
of
the
international
repercussions
of
the
action
that
petitioners
urges
the
case...
petitioners
urge
the
court
to
take
in
this
case.
and
we
would
urge
this
court
to
return
this
matter
to
congress.
congress
is
in
the
position
to
weigh
the
risk
of
international
confusion,
to
weigh
the
potential
for
international
discord
and
to
address
those
matters
as
it
sees...
sees
fit.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
