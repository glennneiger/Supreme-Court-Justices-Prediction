mr.
goldstein,
may...
may
i
take
it
from
your
answer
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
your
view,
your
answer
to
the
question
about
the...
the
ship
leaving
from
a
port
in
england
and
going
many
places
and
touching
base
in
new
york,
that
kind
of
a
voyage,
or
what
this
case
seems
to
be
where
the
vast
majority
of
the
passengers
are
from
the
united
states,
the
port
of
departure
is
in
the
united
states,
the
port
of
return
is
in
the
united
states.
you
don't
seem
to
distinguish
those
cases
because
you
say
in
the
new
york
port,
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
really
a
u.s.
centered
cruise
or
a
cruise
centered
in
italy
or
any
place
else.
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we
go
back
to
what
is
the
more
usual
situation--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
you
are,
in
effect,
saying
that
the
u.s.
rules
the
world.
even
if
the
home
port,
the
place
where
this
vessel
is
usually
berthed,
says
we...
we
don't
require
our
ships
to
take
care
of
the
handicapped,
you
are,
in
effect,
saying
no
matter
what
the
other
ports
say,
what
the
u.s.
law
is
is
going
to
govern
because
practically
if
you're
going
to
design
the
ship
to
meet
the
u.s.
requirements,
you're
not
going
to
rip
those
out
when
the
ship
goes
elsewhere.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
told
me...
and
i
want
to
make
sure
this
is
your
answer...
that
it
doesn't
matter,
that
as
long
as
the
ship
comes
to
a
u.s.
port
as
part
of
this
overall
journey,
you...
you
answered
that
question
and
i
thought
that
was
your
candid
answer,
that
it
doesn't
matter
that
these...
these
particular
cruise
ships
ply
mostly
u.s.
waters
and
u.s.
trade
and
are
centered,
even
have
their
principal
place
of
business
in
the
united
states.
you're
not
concentrating
on
that
category.
you
are
saying
that
the
ada
applies
so
long
as
the
ship
puts
in
at...
at
a
u.s.
port,
picks
up
passengers.
it
applies
not
only
while
it's
in
the
port,
but
practically
for
every
other
place
the
ship
goes.
that's
why
i
asked
isn't
this
the
united
states
rules
the
world
on
what...
your
argument
you
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
do
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
agree
with
mr.
goldstein
that
nothing
turns
on...
one
might
characterize
this
kind
of
cruise
as
u.s.
centered,
but
his
answer
was
as
long
as
they
put
in,
a
regular
cruise
stop,
they
pick
up,
unload
passengers,
they
take
them
back
again
on
the
ship,
so
long
as
they
touch
base
at
a
u.s.
port,
letting
off
and
picking
up
passengers,
the
ada
applies?
do
you
agree
with
that
interpretation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
my--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--let...
let
me
ask
you
the
same
question
that
i
asked
mr.
goldstein.
even
in
the
cunard
case,
the
prohibition
case,
they
couldn't
have
liquor
in
the
u.s.
port,
but
when
they
leave
and
they
go
to
jamaica,
they
could
pick
up
rum
there.
they
could
have
liquor
all
the
rest
of
the
time
so
long
as,
when
they
enter
and
leave
the
u.s.
port,
they
didn't
have
the
liquor
aboard.
here
what
you're
saying
is
what
goes
in
the...
for
the
new
york
port
goes
for
every
other
place
where
this
ship
puts
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
it
doesn't
begin
in
the
united
states
in
that
it...
it
starts
in,
say,
the
bahamas,
and
stops
at--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
compare
to
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
would
be
the
same
for
title
ii,
which
is
the
public
accommodations
part
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
so
i
take
it
that
you
are
saying
that
on
these
foreign
flagged
vessels,
just
as
the
ada
would
be
inapplicable,
so
title
ii,
the
public
accommodations
part
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
would
be
inapplicable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your...
but
your
answer
is,
there
being
no
such
indication,
that
a
ship
putting
in
at
a
u.s.
port
was
free
to
discriminate
among
its
passengers
on
the
basis
of
race.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
about
the
u.s.
law
and
policy
which
says
no
segregation,
no
discrimination
in
places
of
public
accommodation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
same
answer
for
1981?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
this
is...
this
is
what
concerns
me
about
your
answer.
i
know
that
mr.
goldstein
took
the
position
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
kind
of
operation
this
is,
but
the
operation
that
we're
dealing
with,
it
sells
tickets
mainly
to...
what
percentage
of
its
passengers
are
from
the
u.s.a.?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
does
it
normally
start
the
voyage
and
end
it
in
u.s.
ports?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
much
of
its
advertising
budget
is
pitched
at
u.s.
customers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
this
is
the
anomaly.
you're
asking
us
to
buy
an
interpretation.
an
enterprise
is
u.s.
centered
in
terms
of
where
it
gets
its
business
and
that
enterprise,
nonetheless,
is
not
bound
by
what
is
our
bedrock
anti
discrimination
law
both
with
regard
to
customers,
passengers,
and
employment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
doesn't
matter
what
you
want
to
do
as
a
matter
of
good
will.
the
question
is
what
the
law
requires
you
to
do,
and
you're
saying
it's
up
to
us,
we
govern.
you're
not
governed
by
u.s.
antidiscrimination
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
its
principal
place
of
business
in
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
crew
members
were
honduran
in
that
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this...
if
you
just
look
at
it,
suppose
you
were
not
a
lawyer
and
you
look
at
this
operation.
you'd
say
that's
got
u.s.a.
written
all
over
it.
the
passengers
are
from
the
u.s.a..
the
company
is
centered
in
florida.
and
then
you
have
this
flag
of
convenience
that
it
flies
which
can
legitimately
govern
the
relationship
with
its
crew.
but
to
say
that
it
governs
the
relationship
with
passengers,
it
seems
to
me
very
strange.
and
also
the
ticket
says,
passenger,
if
you're
going
to
sue
us,
it's
got
to
be
in
the
united
states
and
under
u.s.
law
to
boot.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just...
it's
just
one
other
indicia
that
one
looks
at
this
operation
and
says
this
belongs
to
the
u.s.a..
a
practical
judgment,
i
think,
would
come
down
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
with
mr.
frederick's
answer
about
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964?
i
mean,
a
lot
of
countries
don't
prohibit
discrimination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
about
the
application
of
u.s.
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
before
you
go
on
to
that,
i
want
to
be
clear
on
your
answer
to
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
'64.
there's...
you
say,
well,
that's
easier
to
comply
with.
but
that's
not
the
principle
under
which
you're
operating.
