justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's...
what's
the
scope
of
what
you're
talking
about
here?
i
mean,
are...
it
says
cruise
ships.
so
i
had
assumed
those
are
those
big
ships
that
carry
people
mostly
around
the
mediterranean
from
florida.
but
based
on
what
you're
saying,
now
i
think
you're
talking
about
something
more.
are
you
talking,
for
example,
about
a
merchant
vessel
that
comes
from,
say,
saudi
arabia
and
has
a
few
passengers?
what's
the...
what's
the
scope
of
the
definition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
it...
what
it
does
is
it
carries
oil,
but
a
certain
number
of
people
like
to
be
on
a
ship
with
oil,
i
guess.
and
so
every...
every
month
they
take
12
people
and
they
put
them
in
a
cabin
somewhere
and
they
love
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i...
but
all
right.
now,
i'm...
i'm
being
facetious.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
am
aware
of...
of
people
who
have
certainly
gone
on
cruises
on
what
is
a
primarily
merchant
ship.
now
that...
that
i
think
is
a
common
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
talking...
because
i
think
that
makes
a
difference
for
the
reason
that
once
you
talk
about
those,
you're
talking
about
primarily
foreign
flagged
vessels
that
are
rarely
but
sometimes
in
the
united
states
where
the
costs
would
be
very
high
probably
to
change
the
ship
and
the
benefit
to
americans
would
be
tiny.
all
right.
so
i...
i
want
to
know
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there's
no
way
they
can
change
the
ship
structurally
when
it's
in
new
york
and
not
have
it
changed
structurally
when
it's
in
europe.
so
the
mystery
to
me
at
this
moment
is
what
is
the
universe
of
ships
that
i
would
not
say
fit
the
ordinary
word
cruise.
what
they
are
are
ships
that
go
between
asia
and
san
francisco,
los
angeles,
or
new
york
and
europe,
or
maybe
through
the
suez
canal.
they're
only
here
a
little
bit
of
the
time.
their
passengers
are
mostly
not
american.
now,
is
that
something
i
should
worry
about?
if
that
were
your
case,
i
would
be
very
worried.
if
that's
just
a
little
bit
of...
of
added
significance,
then
i
want
to
know
what
to
do
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
means--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you're
saying
exactly
what
everybody
is
worried
about.
i
take
it
there
is
no
way
really
for
a
ship
to...
they
either
have
the
right
door
or
they
don't
have
the
right
door.
and
we're
interested
in
the
set
of
cases
in
which
they're
going
to
have
to
change
their
doors.
and
what
i
came
in
here
thinking
was
we're
talking
about
ships
that
pick
up
people
and
sail
in
florida
and
sail
around
the
caribbean.
that's
the...
now,
i've
heard
nothing
but
we're
not
talking
just
about
those.
we
are
talking
about
ships
like
i'm
the
last
human
being
alive
that
went
on
a
swiss
ship
to
europe.
okay?
[laughter]
50
years
ago.
and...
and
we're
talking
about
those
ships,
or
we're
talking
about
merchant
ships
that
also
say
to
the
public,
come
as
a
passenger.
now,
i
would
like
to...
not
what
you're
arguing.
you're
going
to
say,
yes,
we
are
arguing
it.
i
want
to
know...
say
something
to
relieve
my
concern
about
that
set,
which
was
justice
ginsburg's
concern.
we
are
trying
to
rule
the
world
in
respect
to
those
ships
that
only
come
here
occasionally
or
it
isn't
a
big
part
of
their
business,
but
they
want
to
come
to
pick
up
american
passengers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
thing
might
be
true,
what
you're
not
saying,
is
there
really
aren't
very
many
of
those
ships,
or
another
thing
you
might
say,
which
you're
not
saying
because
maybe
isn't
true,
is
almost
all
of
those
ships
that
there
are
are
already
subject
to
tougher...
tougher
rules,
say,
in
europe.
but
you
don't
say
either
of
those.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
since
you
don't
you
say
either
of
those,
i
think
neither
may
be
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
there...
is
there...
i
mean,
you're
giving
me
the
answer
i
thought
the
other
side
would
give
me.
all
right?
and
i
appreciate
it
actually.
[laughter]
you
say
that
two
thirds
of
these
people,
the
customers,
are
american.
so
we're
dealing
with
a
business
that
is
primarily
american,
not
a
business
like
the
swiss
ship
except
in
exceptional
cases.
then
you
say,
all
right,
still
it's
a
problem
because
of
structural
changes
we'll
have
to
make.
what
changes?
that
is
to
say,
i
would
have
thought
i
could
have
read,
but
i
haven't,
that
other
countries
like
europe
also
have
discrimination
laws
against
disabled
people,
and
therefore,
given
that
fact
and
given
the
document
that
mr.
goldstein
produced,
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
your
clients
will
have
to
make
any
significant
structural
change
that
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
make
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what's
the
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if...
if
that's
so
and
if
you
look
at
the
earlier
cases...
but
all
i
could
get
out
it
is
that
those
earlier
cases...
the
court
tries
to
do
what
it
really
would
have
thought
congress
would
have
intended
in
the
circumstances.
and
if
that's
so,
why
wouldn't
congress
really
have
intended
that
a
business
that's
two
thirds
american
has
to
abide
by
american
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does...
does
britain...
or
does
britain
or
does
the
european
union,
for
example,
forbid
you
to
charge
this
double
price?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
european
law...
i'd
be
surprised
if
it
doesn't
forbid
it,
but
do
you
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
they
work
that
out?
that
is,
if
two
thirds
of
our
universe
really
is
american-based,
in
terms
of
customers,
and
we're
now
only
talking
about
conflicts
in...
real
conflicts
that...
that
affect,
say,
one
third
of
the
universe,
that's
also
true
in
areas
like
antitrust
or
others
where
the
enforcement
authorities
get
together
and
they
try
to
write
memoranda
that...
that
work
this
out
in
a
reasonable
way.
could...
could
the
same
thing
happen
here
if
such
real
conflicts
did
emerge?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
would
be
yes,
you
do.
you
do
have
to,
and
then
if
there's
some
other
authority
that
wants
to
get
involved
in
this,
the
two
authorities
would
work
it
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
perfect
because
then
the
government
says
that
once
it
becomes
a
matter
of
binding
international
rule,
anything
that
conflicts
with
that
will
be
viewed
as
not
reasonably
achievable.
so
all
you
have
to
do
is
that
and
then
there's
no
longer
a
problem
with
american
law,
according
to
them.
