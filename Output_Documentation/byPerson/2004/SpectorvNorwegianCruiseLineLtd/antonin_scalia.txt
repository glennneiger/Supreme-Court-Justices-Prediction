justice

we...
we
could...
we
could
require
ships
that
are
docked
in
the
united
states
to
pay
their
crews
according
to
united
states
jones
act
requirements
or
united
states
minimum
wage
laws
and
so
forth.
we
don't
do
that.
we
could
do
it,
but
we
don't
because
it
conflicts
with...
with
the
law
of
the
flag
and...
and
that's
the
usual...
it's
not
a
matter
of
our
power
to
do
it.
we
could
do
it,
of
course,
but
it's
just
not
something
we
ordinarily
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
was...
was
that
the
ship
or
was
it
longshoremen?
justice
antonin
scalia
longshoremen.
longshoremen
based...
based
on
shore.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
cheaper.
it's
cheaper
too.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
questioning
the
authority.
we're
questioning
whether
congress
intended
that
to
be
the
case.
we
have
a
rule
that...
that
requires
a
clear
statement
when
it
has
effects
of
this
sort.
justice
antonin
scalia
when...
when
the
ship
is
out
on
the
high
seas?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that's
a
hard
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
that's
an
extraterritorial
application
of
u.s.
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
extraterritorial
application
means
if
it
doesn't
mean
that,
that
a
ship
that
is
not
in
the
united
states
is
bound
by
united
states
law.
what...
why
isn't
that
extraterritorial
application?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't...
don't
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
depends
on
what...
what
kind
of
laws
you're
talking
about.
laws
that
require
the
crew
to
be
treated
differently
are...
are
quite
different
from
law...
laws
that...
that
require
a
passenger
to
be
treated
a
certain
way
in
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
laws...
laws
that
require
structural
alteration
of
a
ship
are
quite
different
from
laws
that
say
while
you're
in
united
states
waters,
you
won't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
haven't
expressed
it
yet,
we
ought
to
express
it
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you...
why
don't
you
try
to
draw
that
line?
why
don't
you
say
that
just
as
the
applicability
or
not
may
depend
upon
whether
you're
dealing
with
a
crew
of
a
foreign
ship
or
whether
you're
dealing
with
an
american
who
happens
to
be
injured
on
board
that
ship,
so
also
it
may
depend
upon
whether
the
antidiscrimination
law
in
question
is
one
that
at
least
in
some
of
its
applications
requires
structural
changes
or
not?
that
would
enable
you
to
say
the
ada
doesn't
apply,
but
would
not
compel
you
to
say
that
title
ii
doesn't
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
willing
to
take
such
a
limited
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
need...
do
we
need
a
clear
statement
for
united
states
ships?
i
thought
your
case
rested
on
a
clear
statement
requirement.
is
there
any
clear
statement
requirement
for
u.s.
ships?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why...
why
isn't
there
a
clear
difference
between
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
pretty
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
don't
require
a
clear
statement,
that's...
that's
good
enough,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
your...
your
case
hangs
on
the
fact
that,
you
know,
when
congress
wants
to...
to
rule
the
world
and
say
all
ships
in
the...
in
the
world
that
touch
at
our
ports
have
to
have
this
kind
of
a
thing,
it
says
so
clearly.
it
doesn't
have
to
say
so
with
perfect
clarity
with
respect
to
american
ships.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's...
what's
the
full
sweep
argument?
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
you
say
different,
you
mean
you
cannot
comply
with
both.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
you
mean?
or...
or
are
those
just
minimums
and...
and
the
united
states
would...
would
comply
with
those
minimums?
