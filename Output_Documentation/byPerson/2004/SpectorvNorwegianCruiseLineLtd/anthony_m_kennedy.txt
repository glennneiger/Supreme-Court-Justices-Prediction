justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
just
a
little
bit
about
that,
how
it
works?
suppose
that
you
prevail
in
this
case...
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the...
the
charging
the
double
doesn't
involve
modification
of
the
ship,
obviously.
how
does
it
work
if
you
have,
oh,
say,
an
english
passenger
who
buys
an
english
ticket
and
is
charged
double...
i
don't
know
if
that's
the
english
law,
but
let's
assume...
then
he
comes
on
a
cruise
ship
and
he
goes
to
new
york
and
miami
and...
and
new
orleans?
can
he...
does
he...
could
he
then
sue,
if...
if
we
rule
for
you
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
in
u.s.
waters?
that
wouldn't
make
sense.
an
american
buys
a
ticket
in...
in
liverpool.
he's
disabled.
he
goes
to
new
york,
miami,
new
orleans,
and
he's
discriminated
at...
at
each
step.
no...
no
coverage
just
because
of
where
he
bought
the
ticket?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
saying
that
this
is
your
position,
but
don't
worry
about
it
because
we'll
reject
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
so
my
understanding
of
your
answer
is
that
we
could
write
an
opinion
ruling
for
you
but
leaving
these
other
questions
open?
i
don't
see
how
we
can
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
i'm
writing
the
opinion
and
i
put
that
down
and
rule
for
you,
it
seems
to
me
that
i
then
answered
necessarily
justice
ginsburg's
question
in
the
negative.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
these--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why...
why
can't
you
just
fight
that
battle
by
battle
on
what's
reasonably
achievable?
because
in
order
to
avoid
that
problem,
what
you're
telling
us
is
that
a
cruise
line
can
charge
a...
a
disabled
person
double
the
price--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
they're
a
nuisance.
and
that's
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
happens
to
every
employer
under...
in
the
united
states
under
the
reasonably
achievable
standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we...
we
do...
we
do
have
the
rule
if
it...
if
it
applies
to
the
internal
operations
of
the
ship,
and
so
far
as
the
crew
is
concerned,
the
jones
act
and
osha,
it
seems
to
me,
may
well
be
governed
by
the
law
of
the
flag.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
part
of
the
case
i'm
not
sure
about,
and
it
seems
to
me,
again,
it
can
be
fought
out
under
the
reasonably
achievable--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
incidentally
just
for
the...
are...
this
ship
has...
these
are
regulations
that
help
the
disabled?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
to
the
court
is
spector
versus
norwegian
cruise
line
limited.
title
iii
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
imposes
various
accommodation
and
non
discrimination
duties
in
order
to
enable
disabled
individuals
to
enjoy
public
accommodations
and
public
transportation
services.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
title
iii
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
applies
to
the
respondent's
cruise
ships.
now,
the
two
ships
are
the
norwegian
sea
and
then
norwegian
star.
these
ships
depart
from
and
they
return
to
united
states
ports.
they
provide
pleasure
cruises
to
a
clientele
consisting
primarily
of
united
states
residence.
both
ships
however
are
registered
in
the
bahamas
not
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
read
the
cases
from
this
court
as
establishing
a
presumption
that
a
federal
statute
does
not
apply
to
foreign
flag
ships
in
united
states
waters
unless
the
statute
contains
a
clear
statement
that
foreign
vessels
are
covered.
and
title
iii
does
not
mention
specifically
foreign
flag
ships.
so
the
court
of
appeals
reasoned
that
title
iii
of
the
ada
lacks
the
required
clear
statement
and
the
statute
may
not
be
applied
to
respondent's
ships.
that
decision
conflicted
with
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
there
was
conflict
in
the
circuits
so
we
granted
a
certiorari
to
resolve
the
matter.
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
that
court
read
our
cases
in
particular
two
cases
involving
labor
relations
as
establishing
a
broad
clear
statement
rule.
it
concluded
that
no
statutory
requirement
maybe
applied
to
a
foreign
flag
vessel
absent
to
clear
statement.
our
cases
do
not
establish
so
broader
rule.
indeed
the
usual
presumption
is
that
general
statutes
do
apply
throughout
united
states
territories
even
if
the
regulated
identity
is
a
foreign
flag
ship.
this
general
rule
is
subject
only
to
a
narrow
exception,
and
the
principal
cases
from
this
court
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
relied
are
benz
versus
compania
naviera
hidalgo
and
mcculloch
versus
sociedad
nacional
de
marineros
de
honduras.
there
the
court
refused
to
apply
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
labor
relations
between
a
foreign
flagship
and
its
foreign
crew.
those
cases
reasoned
that
the
act
was
intended
to
protect
american
citizens.
extending
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
regulate
relations
between
a
foreign
ship
and
its
crew
was
an
internal
matter
ordinarily
governed
by
the
law
the
flag
state
and
that
would
risk
international
discord.
the
holding
on
those
cases
do
not
support
the
court
of
appeals
broad
rule
but
no
general
statute
including
title
iii
of
the
ada
can
apply
to
a
foreign
flag
vessel
unless
the
statute
specifically
mentions
foreign
flag
ships.
instead
the
inquiries
whether
any
title
iii
requirements
meet
the
standard
established
by
those
cases.
the
standard
for
a
clear
statement
rule
and
it
is
plain
that
in
number
of
title
iii
duties
such
as
provision
on
discriminatory
ticket
pricing
would
not
trigger
the
clear
statement
rule
at
all.
moreover
title
iii
has
its
own
exemptions
and
limitations.
in
particular
title
iii
itself
says
that
a
requirement
regarding
accommodations
must
be
readily
achievable.
thus,
title
iii
may
not
impose
certain
duties
that
might
otherwise
be
thought
to
implicate
the
clear
statement
rule.
there
is
a
particularly
true
in
line
of
the
fact
that
in
our
view
the
title
iii
requirement
is
likely
not
readily
achievable
if
it
would
conflict
with
an
international
legal
obligation
or
pose
a
serious
threat
to
ship
board
safety.
title
iii’s
exemptions
and
limitations
mean
that
it
is
entirely
possible.
the
title
iii
does
not
impose
any
requirements
that
call
for
the
application
of
the
clear
statement
rule.
now,
plurality
of
the
court
goes
on
to
hold
that
the
clear
statement
rule
might
come
in
the
play
of
title
iii
as
read
to
require
permanent
and
substantial
changes
to
a
foreign
ships
basic
physical
design
and
construction.
the
plurality
interprets
this
court's
cases
as
requiring
a
clear
congressional
statement
if
a
statutory
requirement
would
interfere
with
a
foreign
vessel's
internal
affairs
and
operations.
the
plurality
concludes
that
requiring
a
permanent
and
substantial
physical
change
qualifies
as
an
interference
in
the
vessel's
internal
affairs
and
therefore
may
not
be
imposed
absent
the
clear
statement.
if
a
particular
title
ii
requirement
did
require
a
permanent
and
substantial
physical
modification
in
the
ships
design
the
plurality
holds
of
the
requirement
may
not
be
imposed
on
foreign
flag
cruise
ships
even
if
domestic
ships
must
comply
with
that
requirement.
other
title
iii
requirements
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
internal
affairs
do
apply
the
foreign
flagships
and
domestic
ships
alike.
and
for
these
reasons
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
ginsburg
has

opinion

in
