justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
can
enforce
the...
the
discrimination
provisions,
but
the
structural
provisions
don't
have
to
be
enforced.
once
the
step
is
changed,
they're
not
going
to
change
it
when
they
get
3
miles
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
rules
the
world
unless
the
world
does
not
want
to
use
the
united
states
ports
as
ports
of
call.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
you're
saying
is
it
would...
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
it
would
be
the
enforcement
of
the
domestic
contract
of
which
the...
the
statutory
provisions
would
be
an
implied
term.
isn't
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
does
not
apply
of
its
own
force.
it
applies
because
two
parties
in
the
united
states
contracted
that
it
would
apply.
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
justice
stevens'
question
is
you
buy
the
ticket
in
liverpool.
is
the
ada...
an...
an
american
buys
the
ticket
in
liverpool
to
come
to
the
united
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
ada
an
applied
term
of
that
contract?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
salmons,
one
of
the
alternatives
you
threw
out,
not
as
a
response
to
clear
statement,
but
as
a...
a
response
to
the
issue
that
was
being
raised
by
it,
was
the
provision
of
the
statute
that
it
was
intended
to
exercise
the...
the
fullest
extent
of
the...
of
the
commerce
power.
and
the...
the
bahamas
respond
to
that
by
saying
you
could
have
said
exactly...
or
argued
exactly
the
same
thing
in
mcculloch.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
just
ask
you
a...
a
factual
question?
i
didn't
go
back
to
the
text
to
check
this.
does
the
text
of
this
statute
say
in
these
words
basically
we
are
exercising
the
fullest
possible
extent
of
the
commerce
power?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it's
not
in
mcculloch.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it...
it
doesn't
have
the
fullest
extent
language
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
your
answer,
i
take
it,
is
yes,
it
can
discriminate
and
it
can
discriminate
because
congress
has
not
told
it
not
to.
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
far
as
united
states
law
is
concerned,
it
could.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
in
that
case,
there
was...
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
no
legal
relationship
of
any
sort
between
the
supplier
of
the
patent
infringing
object
and
the
ship
in
the
united
states.
so
it
at
least
made
sense
to
classify
that
with
internal
order
as
opposed
to
external
relationships
arguably
involving...
or
implicating
american
law.
you've
got
exactly
the
opposite
situation
here.
you've
got
contracts
made
in
the
united
states
with
the
foreign
cruise
line.
you
didn't
have
that
in
your
patent
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
its
significant
external...
its
significant
commercial
relationships
are
in
the
united
states
with
people
in
the
united
states
performed
partially
in
the
united
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
the
number
of
foreign
ships?
once
we
get
beyond
cruise
lines,
does
it...
would...
would
the...
the
application
on
your
view
cover
the...
the
dozen
passengers
who
decide
they
want
to
take
a
trip
on
a...
on
a
cargo
boat?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the...
what
about
the
full
sweep
argument?
let's
sort
of
come
full
circle
on
that.
you...
you
say
the
full
sweep
argument
is
no
good
because
the
same
thing
could
have
been
made
in
mcculloch.
the
response
was
there
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--full
sweep
of
the
commerce
power.
