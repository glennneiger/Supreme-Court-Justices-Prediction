mr.
david
b.
salmons
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
do
not
think
that
title
iii
of
the
ada
was
intended
to
apply
extraterritorially.
that
said,
we
think
there
is
a
question
that
would
need
to
be
resolved
as
to
whether
applying
the
ada
to
a
public
accommodation
that
was
entered
into
in
the
united
states,
that
began
in
the
united
states,
a
necessary
term
of
which
we
believe
would
be
nondiscrimination,
would
in
fact
be
an
extraterritorial
application
of
u.s.
law.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no.
we
think
the
better
view--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no.
we
think
the
better
view,
in
fact,
justice
scalia,
is
that
that
would
not
be
an
extraterritorial
application
of
u.s.
law.
but
if
the
court
were
to
disagree,
then
we
would
say
title
iii
does
not
apply
at
that
time.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
the
reason,
justice
scalia,
would
be
because
the
accommodation
that
was
offered,
that
was
entered
into,
and
that
began
in
the
united
states...
and...
and
i
would
point
out...
i
think
this
is
important
to
keep
in
mind--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--yes.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
correct.
now...
now,
i...
i
would
just
add
that
i
think
it...
you
could
characterize
a
public
accommodation,
you
know,
five
nights
lodging,
for
example.
if
that's
entered
into
in
the
united
states
and...
and
that
begins
in
the
united
states,
that
a
necessary
term
of
that
is
nondiscrimination,
and--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--if
you
have
an
ada
claim
that
governs
that
even
if
the
discrimination
occurred
abroad,
that
would
only
relate
to
those
things
tied
into
the
accommodation.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
again,
we...
we
think
that
if
accommodation
begins
here
in
the
united
states,
that...
that
a
necessary
term
of
that
is
nondiscrimination.
now,
whether
you
characterize
that
as
a
contract
claim
or
as
a
substantive
application
of
the
ada,
i'm
not
sure
there's
much
of
a
difference.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
to
come
to
the
united
states.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
would...
i
would
assume
not,
although
the
question
then
would
be
whether
or
not
it's
a
public
accommodation
that's
been
offered
in
the
united
states.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no,
no,
justice
kennedy,
that's
not
our
position.
let
me...
let
me
try
and
be
clear.
we
think
that
any
vessel
that
comes
into
the
internal
waters
and
ports
of
the
united
states
and
offers
a
public
accommodation
or
a
specified
public
transportation
service
to
our
residents
is
subject
to
the
ada.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
if...
if
you
had
a
situation...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
if
you
had
a
situation
where
you
had
a
ship
that...
let's
say,
that
began
in...
in
great
britain
and
came
here,
it
didn't
pick
up
passengers
here
in
the
united
states,
i
think
that
the
better
view
would
be,
sure,
united
states
law
could
apply
to
it
because
it's
in
our
internal
waters,
but
that
as
a
substantive
matter,
with
regard
to
the
ada,
i
don't
know
why
that
would
be
a
public
accommodation
within
the
meaning
of
the
ada
because
it's
not
an
accommodation
that's
offered--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--or
available
to
united
states
residents.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
as
i
understand
what
your
honor
just
said,
i
think
that
i
would.
let
me
just
clarify,
though.
we
think
the
relevant
question
is
whether
that
ship
would...
has
offered
a
public
accommodation
or
a
specified
public
transportation
service--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--in
the
united
states,
and
if
the
answer
is
yes--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
again,
i...
not
as
a
matter
of...
not
as
a
matter
of
extraterritorial
application
of
u.s.
law,
but
that
is
our
position
with
regard
to
a
public
accommodation
that
begins
in
the
united
states.
i...
i
think
the...
the
important--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
should
probably
should
not
have
said
begin,
your
honor.
what
i
mean
is
if
it...
if
the
public
accommodation
is
provided
for
in
the
united
states,
that
would
be
covered
by
the
terms
of
the
ada,
we
think
the
ada
applies.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
sure.
and
what
i
would
say
with
regard
to
that
is
that
you're
right
that
our
broad
view
is
that
the
ada
applies
if
that...
if
they're
offering
public
accommodation
here
in
the
united
states.
but
if
you
reject
that,
i
think
there
are
several
ways
you
could
approach
that.
one
would
be
to
apply
traditional
choice
of
law
factors
that
are...
that
are
applicable
in
maritime,
and
you
could
conclude,
you
know,
based
on
sort
of
whether
or
not
there
are
sufficient
contacts
here
and
whether
or
not--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no,
no.
he
asked
me
to
say
something
that...
that
would...
would
help
his
concerns.
what
i'm
trying
to
say--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no.
no--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
i
don't
know
the
specific
number.
i
would
think
that
there
are
not
many
that
the...
that
this...
what
you're
concerned
with
primarily
here
are
cruise
ships
that
are
in
the
business
of
providing
public
accommodations.
but
i
would
add
as
well...
and
i
think
this
is
very
important
that
the
court
keep
in
mind...
that
the
clear
statement
rule,
as
it's...
as
it's
posited
by
respondent
here,
would
not
just
apply
to
the
ada.
it
would
apply
to
all
u.s.
laws,
and
that
would
include
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
in
its
prohibition
of
racial
discrimination,
and
i
would
find
that
that
would
be
a
remarkable
construction.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
justice
scalia,
you're
correct,
and
that's
precisely
why
they
have--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--if...
two...
two
responses,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
and
that
is,
if
you...
if
that
is
the
conclusion
you
reach,
then
you
still
need
to
remand
this
case
because
there
are
an
awful
number
of
claims
that
are
precisely
those
kinds
of
claims
that
the
fifth
circuit
would
not
allow.
secondly,
i
think
you're
wrong
with
regard
to
the
scope
of
the
clear
statement
requirement.
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
have
to
have
a
clear
statement
to
apply
a
u.s.
law
to
a
foreign
vessel.
there
is
only
a
requirement
that
you
need
a
clear
statement
if
the
conduct
at
issue
would
relate
only
to
the
internal
matters
of
that
vessel.
and
here
you're
dealing
with
public
accommodation--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
i
disagree,
your
honor.
and
what
i
would
point
you
to
is...
is
that
the
long...
every
time
this
court
has
spoken
with
regard
to
the
clear
statement
requirement
relating
to
foreign
flagged
ships,
it
has
referred
to
the
internal
order
doctrine.
and
that
is
embodied
in
a
number
of
bilateral
agreements
that
go
back
for
centuries.
the...
the
treaty
that
was
at
issue
in
the
wildenhus's
case
expressly
said
that
if
the...
if
the
conduct
did
not
relate
to
members
of
the
crew
but
to
passengers
or
other
members
of
the
port
state
or
otherwise
affected
the
interests
of
the
port
state,
that
the
port
state
law
would
apply.
and
that
is
the
general
rule.
the
international
regime
that
governs
this
area
by
its
terms
provide
minimum
standards
and
leaves
it
available
to
port
states
and
to
flag
states
to
add
additional
requirements.
that
would
mean--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
i...
i
would
disagree
with
that
on...
on
a
couple
of
respects.
the
first
is
that
the
definition
of
commerce
here
is
broader
than
it
was
and
specifically
refers
to
travel
between
the
united
states
and
foreign
countries.
the
only
other
statute
we're
aware
of
that
says
that
is
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
in
addition--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--absolutely,
justice
souter.
what...
what
the
text
of
the
statute
says--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
correct.
what
the
text
of
this
statute
says
is
that...
in
fact,
this
is
the
definition
of
commerce
that
relates
only
to
title
iii
of
ada.
and
it
says
precisely
that
it
includes
travel
between
foreign
countries
and
the
united
states
and
that
congress
was
intending
to...
to
reach
the
full
sweep
of
its...
its
constitutional
authority.
