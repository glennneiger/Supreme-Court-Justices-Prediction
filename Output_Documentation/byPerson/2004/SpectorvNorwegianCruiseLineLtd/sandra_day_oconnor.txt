mr.
goldstein,
may
i
inquire
of
you
whether
other
countries,
for
instance,
in
the
eu
area,
have
applied
their
own
disability
laws
to
some
of
the
cruise
ships
that
touch
base
in
their
courts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
and
would
you
also
address
at
some
point
how
the
treaty
on
safety
of
life
at
sea
would
affect
the
resolution
here?
for
example,
it
has,
as
i
understand
it,
requirements
that
there
be
watertight
doors
and
those
doors
have
to
be
set
above
the
level
of
the
floor
so
you
couldn't
roll
a
handicapped
wheelchair
or
something
over
it.
now,
do
you
anticipate
that
there
would
have
to
be
structural
changes
if
you
were
to
prevail
that
would
conflict
with
the
treaty
on
safety
of
life
at
sea?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
they
in
effect
yet?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
you
address
the
last
point?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
this
is
a
good
question,
and
what
is
your
position?
that
the
ship
could
engage
in
racial
discrimination
while
in
u.s.
ports
on
the
selling
of
tickets
and
the
provision
of
accommodations
while
in
u.s.
ports
and
within
the
3--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
the
ada
itself
makes
an
exception
for
things
that
aren't
readily
achievable.
i
mean,
you
could
certainly
lean
on
that
because
a
structural
change
probably
isn't
readily
achievable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
that
limited,
though,
just
to
things
that
affect
the
internal
order
of
the
ship?
is
that
the
context
in
which
we've
articulated
that
rule?
