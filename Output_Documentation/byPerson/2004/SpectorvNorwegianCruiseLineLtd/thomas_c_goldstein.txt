mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
american
citizens
who
took
cruises
to
and
from
this
country
on
tickets
bought
here
that
call
for
the
application
of
u.s.
law.
they
were
subject
to
discrimination
by
respondent,
a
u.s.
based
company
on
the
land,
in
the
ports,
and
in
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
applies
or
instead
whether
respondent's
conduct
is
lawful
because
the
case
is
controlled
by
bahamian
law,
which
freely
permits
cruise
lines
to
discriminate
against
persons
with
disabilities.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
o'connor,
our
research
does
not
reveal
that
the
question
has
arisen
in
the
eu.
i
can,
however,
provide
you
some
information,
and
that
is
that...
two
points
i
think.
the
first
is
they
subscribe...
the
members
of
the
eu
subscribe
to
the
same
conventions
and
to
unclos
just
the
way
we
do,
which
gives
the
port
state
plenary
authority
within
its
ports
and
internal
waters.
and
i
have
a
couple
of
case
citations
for
you
on
this
issue.
in
the
ecj,
the
diva
navigation
case,
1992,
ecr
i-6019.
it
has
not
arisen
in
the
eu,
but
it
has
arisen
in
australia.
australia
has
a
disability
law.
it
applies
that
law
to
cruise
ships,
and
the
rule
in
australia
is
that
the
port
state
law
applies
rather
than
the
flag
state
law.
and
the
citation
for
that
is
the
union
shipping
case,
2002,
nswca
124
ca
40379/01.
i
don't
know
what
those
numbers
mean.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
and
you
have
put
your
finger
on
the
point,
and
that
is
that
there
are
no
conflicts.
we
know
that
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
first
is
that
there
has
been
a
detailed
rule
making
underway
in
which
the
regulatory
authorities
charged
by
congress
with
implementing
the
ada
have
spent
quite
some
time.
they
have
produced
this
single
spaced,
half
inch
thick
document
that
is
dedicated
to
making--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--they
are
not,
but
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
the
statute,
when
it's
applied,
would
conflict,
you
would
look
to
this
document
and
they
took
as
their
regulatory
mission
to
make
sure
there
were
no
such
conflicts.
what
they
did...
let
me
take
your
example
specifically
and
then
put...
place
it
within
the
statutory
framework.
within
the
ada
and
a
question
of
the
combings,
what
they
said
is,
that's
right.
in
certain
cases
solas
requires
that
the
coamings
be
a
certain
height.
if
the
coamings
are
below
the
bulkhead
level,
where
you
would
be
worried
about
water
coming
in
below,
that
is
not
an
accessible
route,
and
so
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it
at
all.
above
there,
you
ramp
up
to
the
coaming
and
ramp
down,
unless
that's
structurally
infeasible.
so
they...
what
they
did
is
they...
and
this
is
the
broader
point.
they
applied
the
rule
of
the
ada
that
a
change
to
the
structure
of
the
vessel
only
has
to
be
implemented
if
it's
readily
achievable.
and
what
the
regulatory
authorities
determined
is
that
if
there
is
any
conflict
with
solas
at
all,
that
change
need
not
be
made.
now,
you...
justice
o'connor,
you
also
focused
on
the
fact
that
there
are
some
of
our
claims
that
implicate
the
structure
of
the
ship.
they
are,
however,
a
distinct
minority,
and
we
ought
not
lose
sight
of
this
because
i
don't
think
the
other
side
has
any
good
argument
at
all,
under
international
law
or
anything
else,
that
would
explain
why
they
can
charge
a
person
with
a
disability
double.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
would
think
on
the
question
of
the
charging
double,
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
no
because
it
would
present
a
traditional,
not
unique
to
the
ada,
choice
of
law
question,
and
that
is,
if
you're
in
england
and
you
buy
a
ticket
in
england,
your
ticket
is
going
to
be
subject
to
english
common...
in
that
case,
the
english
disability
law.
there
is
an
english
disability
law.
it
doesn't
discuss
cruise
ships.
it's...
but
it's
broadly
written.
but
with
respect
to
the
structure
of
the
ship,
i
think
that
english
passenger
with
a
disability...
say
that
you
come
across
to
the
united
states
and
you
want
to
get
off
in
new
york.
i
think
that
congress
clearly
intended
that
that
person
would
be
able
to
come
off
a...
off
the
dock
in
a
wheelchair,
back
onto
the
dock
on
the
wheelchair;
while
you
were
in
u.s.
ports
and
you're
staying
in
your
cabin,
that
you
would
be
able
to,
in
your
accessible...
your
accessible
rest
room,
have
grab
bars.
we
are...
and...
and
let
me
not
pass
too
quickly
by
the
fact
that
even
when
we
talk
about
some
structural
changes
in
the
ship,
by
and
large
we're
talking
about
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with...
justice
o'connor,
you
focused
the
name
of
the
treaty
is
the
safety
of
life
at
sea.
whether
the
bathroom
doors
swing
in
and
out
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
whether
there
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
think
your
formulation
is
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg.
it
doesn't
matter
to
us
where
the
cruise
is
centered.
we
do,
however,
and
this
court's
precedents
do,
however,
leave
room
for
a
highly
unusual
cruise
that
i'm
not
aware
exists.
take,
for
example,
a
situation
in
which
a
cruise
comes
from
england
to
the
united
states.
it
doesn't
pick
up
any
passengers
here.
they
just
visit.
they
stop
in
15
other
countries.
they
stop
here.
the
same
passengers
get
up
on
the
ship
and
leave.
this
court's
precedents
involving
maritime
choice
of
law
leave
room
for
the
conclusion
that
says,
look,
we
just
don't
think--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
ginsburg,
we
disagree
with
the
characterization
that
the
u.s.
rules
the
world,
of
course.
we're
talking
about
the
fact
congress
exercised
its
sovereign
authority
to
control
vessels
in
its
ports
and
internal
waters,
just
as
in...
take
the
cunard
example.
in
the
cunard
case,
there
were
countries...
and
i
understand
it
didn't
involve
the
structure
of
the
ship,
but
the
principle
is
the
same.
there
were
countries
that
required
alcoholic
beverages
to
be
on
those
vessels,
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
actually
disagree
with
your
characterization
and
would
like
to
point
you
to
a
couple
of
precedents.
the
benz
and
mcculloch
cases,
which
are
very
important
to
the
respondents,
were
very
important
to
the
fifth
circuit,
embody
the
principle
that
you
just
described,
to
some
extent,
and
that
is
that
when
you
have
a
foreign
ship
in
our
waters,
we
will
not
apply
the
nlra
to
the
labor
contract
between
the
foreign
crew
and
the
foreign
vessel.
but
when
americans
are
involved,
we
do
apply
the
nlra,
and
that's
the
ariadne
precedent
that
the...
and...
and
in
fact,
ariadne
is
the
most
on
point
case
because
it--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
was
longshoremen
working
on
the
ship
complaining
about
safety
conditions
on
the
ship.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
based
on
shore,
but
so
are
the
passengers.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
but
it
is
a
different
situation,
but
i
think
it's
more
analogous.
not
only
were
the...
the
protests
in
ariadne
directed
at
the
safety
conditions
on
the
foreign
flagged
vessel,
but
they
were
directed
at
the
passengers.
if
i
could--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the...
well,
that...
the
definition...
we
would
have
to
return
to
the
ada.
if
a
merchant
ship
has
a
few
passengers,
it
would
not
be
a
specified
form
of
public
transportation
or
a
public
accommodation.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i'm
not
aware
of...
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
if...
let
me--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
let
me
first
say...
and
just
to...
to
lock
the
point
down
in
that
cost
is
accounted
for
in
the
definition
of
what
is
readily
achievable.
but
let's
go
to
the
definition
of
specified
public
transportation
because
this
will
tell
us
what's
going
to
be
covered
by
the
ada.
and
just
for
the
transcript,
the
citation
is...
this
is
section
12181(110).
it's...
it's
very
short,
but
it's
at
the
middle
of
page
12
of
the
blue
brief.
specified
public
transportation
means
transportation
by
bus,
rail,
or
any
other
conveyance
other
than
by
aircraft,
which
has
its
own
statute,
that
provides
the
general
public
with
general
or
special
service
on
a
regular
and
continuing
basis.
that
too
would
be
covered.
and
only
the
public
places
on
the
ship
would
be
covered
by
it.
can
i
just
return
briefly
to
my
ariadne
point?
because
i
just
wanted...
that's
a
case
where
the...
the
nlra
was
applied.
and
let
me
just
read
to
you
what
the
protest
was
that
the
nlra
was
applied
to
because
it
fits
perfectly
with
this
case.
and
again,
for
the
transcript,
this
is
in
the
lower
court
opinion
at

this

is
your
cruise
ship
a
floating
death
trap?
can
a
substandard
foreign
flagged
cruise
ship
turn
your
holiday
into
a
holocaust?
they
were
very
illiterate.
if
thousands
of
unsuspecting
americans
continue
to
place
their
lives
in
jeopardy
every
day
on
cruises
aboard
foreign
flagged
floating
fire
traps.
and
that...
that
was
a
foreign
flagged
ship.
they
we're
concerned
about
the
passengers.
justice
scalia,
you
also
gave
the
example
of
the
jones
act,
but
remember
that
the
rhoditis
case
and
the
uravic
case,
which
involved
injuries
in
the
united
states,
then
the
jones
act
did
apply.
and
that
was...
and
rhoditis
was
a
case
in
which
someone
was
on
the
ship
and
a
chain
broke
and
they
were
injured
as
a
result
of
it,
and
u.s.
law
applied.
this
is
a
situation
in
which
millions
of
people
in
the
united
states
are
spending
billions
of
dollars
on
cruises,
and
it
seems--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
but
i...
i
take
it
that
the...
you
know--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it...
it
is
in
the
sense
that
it
makes
this
the
recurring
scenario
that
congress
would
have
been
aware
of
when
it
enacted
the
ada
in--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
true.
in
the
very
rare
case,
which
i
am
not
aware
of,
in
which
a
cruise
ship
comes
to
the
united
states,
doesn't
pick
up
passengers,
then
it's
possible
that
the...
that
the
ada
would
not
apply.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
would
in...
in
u.s.
territory.
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
let
me
tell
you
what
i
know,
and
that
is
that
the
other
side
has
not
identified
any
problems
of
this...
this
type.
my
research
has
not
revealed
some
situation
where
we
have
a
lot
of
these
ships.
i
did
carefully
study
the...
the
itineraries
of
the
major
cruise
lines,
and
95
percent
plus
of
all
of
their
trips
go
out
from
the
united
states
and
come
back
to
the
united
states.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
ginsburg,
here
i
think
is
the
difference,
and
that
is,
that
while
u.s.
law
may
have
an
extraterritorial
consequence,
just
like
our
maritime
tort
law
and
the
like,
you
cannot
in
europe
enforce
the
ada.
the
fact
that
the
structural
changes--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
right.
but
justice...
justice
ginsburg's
point...
i
take
it
to
be
a
more
particular
one.
it's
true
that
our
law
will
have
consequences
abroad,
but
it
is
not
the
case
that
the
u.s.
rules
the
world.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice...
justice
souter,
i...
i
simply
disagree,
and
that
is,
when
you
talk
about
the
u.s.
ruling
the
world,
in
a...
in
the
context,
say,
of
aramco,
we
talked
about
the
enforceability
of
u.s.
law
abroad.
when
the
united
states
has
tort
standards
or
vehicle
manufacturing
standards
and
the
like,
all
of
those
have
consequences
abroad
for
how
devices
are
made
and
brought
into
the
country.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that...
what's
going
on
is
the
plenary
authority
of
the
united
states
to
enforce
its
laws
in
its
ports
and
in
its
internal
waters.
that
very
rule
always
will
have
extraterritorial
consequences.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
we
disagree,
and
let
me
just
take
you
to
your
cases.
i
did
that,
i
think,
in
the
jones
act
and
the
nlra
context.
but
let's
just
state
the
rule,
and
that
is,
from
the
wildenhus's
case
and
that's
at
page
12.
foreign
law
governs
matters
of
discipline
and
all
things
done
on
board
which
affected
only
the
vessel
and
those
belonging
to
her
and
did
not
involve
the
peace
or
dignity
of
the
country
or
the
tranquility
of
the
port.
and
what
we're
talking--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is...
that
is
a
difficult
question.
we
have
not...
we
have
not
pleaded
such
a
claim.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
do
believe
it
would
be
covered
because
the
accommodation
was
purchased
here,
although
we
haven't
raised
the
claim
in
this
court.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
stevens,
our
position
is
that
because
of
the
definition
of
commerce
in
the
ada,
when
you
purchase
a
public
accommodation
in
the
united
states,
that
is
an
agreement
to
provide
a
public
accommodation
and
it
doesn't--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
right,
although
we
have...
we
would
win
the
case
on
the
internal
waters
and
the
territorial
waters,
and
we
haven't
asserted
in
this
court
a
claim
relating
to
the
high
seas.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
breyer
and
justice
ginsburg,
our
position
is
the
one
that
can
accommodate
your
concerns.
theirs
cannot.
just
like
in
empagran,
where
this
court
built
in
comity
considerations,
relying
on
cases
like
lauritzen
that
involved
foreign
flagged
ships,
it
said,
look,
even
if
the
text
of
the
sherman
act
or
the
ftaia
could
literally
reach
it,
in
these
cases
that
we
don't
think
congress
could
have
conceived
of,
we're
not
going
to
apply
the
statute.
but
here,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
this
company
has
95
percent
of
its
cruises
going
in
and
out
from
the
united
states.
millions
of
people,
and
billions
of
dollars
in
commerce
are
affected
by
this
statute
and
americans
that
congress
had
to
have
in
mind.
