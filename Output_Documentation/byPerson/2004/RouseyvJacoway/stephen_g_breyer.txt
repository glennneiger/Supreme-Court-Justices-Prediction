justice
stephen
g.

what
is
the
percentage
amount
of
the
payments
that
are
taken
out
of
all
ira
plans
before
people
are
59
and
a
half?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the...
the
payment
here...
it
says...
the
statute
uses
the
word
payment.
so
suppose
you
simply
have
an
ira
plan
but
you
don't
take
money
out
of
it.
then
is
it
exempt
from
bankruptcy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so...
but
i'm
trying...
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is
if
a
person
were
to
take...
just
reading
it
in
english,
it
sounds
as
if
a
person
were
to
take
the
plan
out
before
he's
59
and
a
half
and
pay
the
penalty,
that
that
amount
that
he
took
out
would
not
be
a...
a
payment
because
of
age,
but
one
that
he
took
out
after
he's
59
and
a
half
and
didn't
pay
the
penalty
would
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's...
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
how...
how...
what
the
theory
is.
is...
you
say
i
have
a
right
to
receive
payments
because
of
age.
and
you
say,
well,
here
i
have
a
body
of
money
and
99
percent
comes
out
of
it
after
you're
60.
1
percent
comes
out
before.
so
it's
very
tempting
to
say
that
that
corpus
there,
of
course,
is
a
body
of
money
that
you're
going
to
have
a
right
to
receive
because
of
age
because
the
practical
effect
of
the
10
percent
is...
is...
stops
the...
the
younger
person
getting
the
money.
so
does
the
case
then
turn
on
that?
i
mean,
suppose...
suppose
it
were
a
3
percent
penalty
and
40
percent
of
the
people
took
out
the
money
before
they
were
60
or
a
1
percent
penalty
and
80
percent
did
it.
then
should
i
reach
the
other
result?
i'm
just
trying
to
think
of
how
does
this
analysis
work.
what's
the
right
analysis?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
percent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
as
purely
english...
as
purely
english,
i
read
it
as
saying
it's
a
right.
what
is
that
right?
the
right
is
a
right
to
receive
a
payment
on
account
of
age.
that's
the...
a
plan.
that's
the
right.
now,
your
argument,
i
take
it,
was...
is
that
yes,
it's
true
you
also
have
a
right
under
certain
conditions
to
take
it
without
respect
to
age.
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
plan
that
gives
you
both
kind
of
rights.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
kind
that
gives
you
a
right
to
take
it
with
a
penalty
and
a
right
to
take
it
because
of
age
without
a
penalty.
and
thus,
the
question
is,
is
that
kind
of
plan
which
gives
you
both
kind
of
rights
covered?
and
the
language
doesn't
answer
it.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
why?
okay.
once
you're
down
that
road,
you
have
conceded,
as
you
must,
that
a
plan
that
says
you
get
the
money
because
of
age
but
you
also
can
get
the
money
without
respect
to
age
in
certain
circumstances
can
be
a
plan
covered
by
the
act.
now,
that's
the
kind
of
a
plan
that's
right
in
front
of
you.
so,
therefore,
literally
it
falls
just
as
much
within
the
language
as
the
other
that
you
want
to
say
even
though
that
is
literally
true,
this
plan
is
very
different
from
the
others
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
act.
that's
what
i
would
like
to
hear
because
to
me,
i'm
not
so
moved
by
holistic
as
i
am
by
purposes,
which
is
part
of
holistic.
so...
so
the...
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
know
is
why,
since
ordinary
people
think
of
ira's
as
pensions...
i
do.
i
think
of
it
that
way.
i
don't
know
much
about
it.
it's
designed
to
help
in
the
future,
help
when
you're
old
and
sick.
but
there
is
this
extra
thing
in
it
which
you
point
to.
so
why,
in
terms
of
purposes
is
this
different
from
the
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that,
but...
but...
and
you
do
it
with
a
penalty.
we
agree
about
the
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
want
to
know
why
that
difference
makes
a
difference
in
a
world
where
only
1
or
less
2
percent
of
the
people
do
access
it
before
they're
60,
59
and
a
half.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i...
you've
missed
my
point
and
i'm
sorry.
i
put
you
on
the
wrong
track
with
my
following
up.
i
shouldn't
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is
we
all
agree
that
there
can
be
plans
where
you
can
get
the
money
not
having
to
do
with
age,
and
they
fall
within
the
language
of
the
act,
and
indeed,
you
say
some
are
covered.
but
this
one
you
say
is
worse
than
the
others
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
the
act,
and
that's
what
i
want
to
hear
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
that's
the
answer,
excellent.
so
now
we
have--
[laughter]
--let's
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let's
try...
let's
try
a
million
percent
tax
and
nobody
in
history
has
ever
withdrawn
the
money.
now,
would...
that
you
would
say
would
fall
within
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
if
that
would
fall
within
this,
going
back
to
justice
stevens,
because
that
operates
as
a
bar
to
prevent
the
bad
world
that
justice
scalia
mentioned,
why
doesn't
a
tax
that
operates
as
a
bar
that's
good
enough
to
stop
98.5
percent
of
the
people
from
withdrawing
their
money
and
having
nothing
left
for
old
age...
why
isn't
that
just
as
good
as
the
million
percent
tax
in
a
world
that
is
imperfect?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
93.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should
we
put
any
weight
on
the
title,
on
the
name?
i
mean,
i...
i
can't
but
thinking
it's
an
individual
retirement
account.
was
congress
trying
to
fool
people?
[laughter]
was
the
federal
trade
commission?
should
they
investigate?
what...
i
mean,
the...
the...
i
think
of
it
as
an
account
that's
basically
aimed,
at
least
congress
thought
it
was
aimed,
at
retirement,
which
has
usually
to
do
with
age.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
reading
the
statute
and
if
i
were
voting
on
it
and
put
in
the
408
reference
and
think
of
the
word
individual
retirement
account,
is
there
any...
i
would
have
thought,
knowing
not
that
much
about
it,
that
of
course,
they'd
be
included.
now,
is
there
any
indication,
when
people
passed
this,
that
they
didn't
think
they
would
be?
any...
any
reference
in
the
terrible
words,
legislative
history,
that
might
shed
light
on
it?
