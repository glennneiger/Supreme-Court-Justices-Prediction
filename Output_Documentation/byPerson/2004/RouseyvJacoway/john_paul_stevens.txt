john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
the
case
of
rousey
against
jacoway.
ms.
karlan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
does
the
word
holistic
mean?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
mckiever.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
supposing
instead
of
a
10
percent
penalty,
there
was
an
absolute
prohibition,
would
you
agree...
on
getting
the
money
before
you're
59
and
a
half,
would
then
that
qualify?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
what
if
there
were
a
50
percent
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
it
that
makes
it
a
prohibition?
is
it...
is
it
because
the
purpose
is
to
deter
withdrawals,
or
it
is
that
it
becomes
economically
unacceptable?
what...
what
is
the
reason
for
drawing
the
line
somewhere
above
10
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
the
purpose
of
imposing
any
penalty
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
50
percent
would
not
be
a
prohibition
and
neither
would
90
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
a
matter
of
degree
rather
than
a
difference
in
kind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
the
easiest
black
letter
rule
is
no
tax
or
some
tax.
i
mean,
if
it
was
totally
free
like
an
ordinary
bank
account,
then
you'd
be
dead
right.
but
the
fact
that
for
a...
an
important
purpose
there
is
a
10
percent
penalty
put
in
seems
to
me
puts
it
into
the
category
of
things
that
are...
you're
not
supposed
to
have
an
absolute
right
to
get.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
right
to
receive
100
percent
is...
is
dependent
on
a
factor,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
at
least
as
to
the
10
percent
that
would
be
penalty,
there's
no
right
to
get
that
money
unless
you
have
a
certain
age.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
words,
on
account
of,
in
this...
this
statute
are
sort
of
unusual,
no
matter
how
you
construe
them,
because
really
the
payment
is
on
account
of
the
years
of
service
or
it's
on
account
of
a
lot
of
things.
you
may
become
eligible
at
a
certain
time.
it
would
be
better
if
it
said
a
payment
for
which
you
became
eligible
for
one
of
these
reasons
because
the
payment
isn't
really
on
account
of
all
of
these
things.
you
may
get
the
same
amount
whether
you're
disabled
or
not
depending
on
what
the
terms
of
the
plan
are.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms.
mckiever.
ms.
karlan,
you
have
about
7
minutes.
you're
not
required
to
use
it
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
any
judge
ever
taken
the
view
that...
adopting
justice
scalia's
approach,
that
while
you
can't
put
the
whole
ira...
exempt
the
whole
ira,
but
you
can
exempt
10
percent
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
you
ought
to
get
that
much,
it
seems
to
me,
under
his...
his
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
