ms.
karlan,
the...
as
long
as
this
money
was
in
the
plan,
it
was
shielded
from
bankruptcy,
and
there
are...
there
was
not
unlimited
access
even
with
the
penalty
when
it
was
in
the
plan.
one
thing
that
i
don't
know
and
may
be
of
some
significance,
did
the
rouseys
have
a
chance,
even
though
they
lost
their
employment,
to
keep
their
money
in
the
plan
where
it
would
be
shielded
from
bankruptcy
or
did
they
have
to
roll
it
over?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
another
employer's
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
could
not
have
kept
it
in
this
employer's
plan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a
term
of
the
plan
that
it...
you
can
remain
in
it
only
so
long
as
you're
employed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
take
this
concrete
case?
hers
was
something
over
$12,000;
his,
something
over
$42,000.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
claim
here
as
to...
was
part
or
all
of
that...
it
would
be
some
$54,000.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
didn't
congress
just
put
in
ira's
along
with
the
other
things?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that's
sort
of
an
oblique
way
to
get
it
there.
i
mean,
why
didn't
they
put
it
together
with
the
other
string
of
plans?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
some
don't.
the...
the
state
systems
vary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
opposed
to
how
many
who
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
what...
with
the
purpose
that
we're
talking
about
now--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
it's
only
6
that,
faced
with
a
bankruptcy,
would
shelter
the
ira.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here
there
was
no
choice
of
picking
up
on
the
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
one
train
that
we
didn't
finish
before.
you
were
explaining
that
in
this
case
the
entire
$55,000...
that
entire
sum
would
be
needed...
would
be
necessary
for
the
support
of
the
debtors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
that
was
your
claim,
and
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
did
you
come
to
that
conclusion,
that
the
entire
amount?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
are
they?
because
there
was
one
statement...
i
think
it
was
in
ms.
karlan's
brief...
that
the
fifth
circuit
said
profit-sharing
plans
permit
participants
to
withdraw
up
to
the
entire
amount
on
payment
of
the
penalty.
so
a
profit-sharing
plan,
which
was
one
of
the
ones
on
the
list,
seems
to
be
substantially
identical
if
you
can
also
take
out,
whenever
you
like,
as
long
as
you're
willing
to
pay
the
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there...
there
is
no
penalty
attached
to
withdrawing
from
a
savings
account,
and
there's
also
no
limit
on
the
annual
contribution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do...
do
you
disagree
with
ms.
karlan
that
this
is...
this
is
a
standardized
product
so
the
people,
the
rouseys
of
this
world,
really
couldn't
get
a
tailor-made
ira?
they
would
have
to
take
the
standard
product.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
dispute
that...
that
a
very
small
percentage
of
people
who
have
ira's,
in
fact,
exercise
the
right
to
withdraw,
given
the
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
your
argument
draw
a
ring
around
ira's?
it
was
suggested
that
if
your
argument
prevails,
then
these
other
plans
would
be
affected
as
well.
