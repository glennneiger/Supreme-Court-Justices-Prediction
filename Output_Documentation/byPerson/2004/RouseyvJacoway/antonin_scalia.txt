justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
a
case
i
dissented
in,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
when
you
say
full
enjoyment,
you...
you
think
when...
when
i'm
taxed
on
something,
i...
i
don't
have
full
enjoyment
of
it?
the
only
thing
triggered
by
age,
as
far
as
i
can
tell...
the
only
thing
triggered
by
age...
is
your
obtaining
of
a
tax
benefit.
that's
all.
once
you
reach
a
certain
age,
you
can
withdraw
it
without...
without
paying
the
10
percent
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
sure
it
does,
but...
but
it's...
it's
hard
to
accept
the
notion
that
simply
because
after
a
certain
age
i
get
a
tax
benefit,
i'm
receiving
the
money
on
account
of
my
age.
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
any
other
plans
that
are...
are
entities
clearly
covered
by
the
statute
in
which
the
only
effect
of
age
is
to
enable
you
to
avoid
a
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
well,
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
you
might
persuade
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
might
be
wrong
anyway.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they're
taking
out
loans
against
it.
they're...
they're
not
withdrawing
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
too
holistic
for
me.
what...
what
does
it...
what
does
it
modify?
i
mean,
if
you
had
to
diagram
it,
on
account
of
goes
to
what
noun?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
thought
i
was
being
holistic
yesterday,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
what
does
on
account
of
modify?
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
is
that
noun?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
right
to
receive
a
payment
under
a
stock
bonus,
pension--
justice
antonin
scalia
--profit
sharing,
annuity,
or
similar
plan
or...
or
contract.
it's
a
plan
on
account
of
illness,
an
annuity?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
right
on
account
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
strong
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
right...
it's
not
a
right
if
you
have
to
pay
a
penalty
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
good
argument.
i
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
your...
what
your
opponents
say
is
that
the...
the
thing
at
the
end
doesn't
prove
anything
because
they're
willing
to
acknowledge
that
some
ira's
can
be
so
structured
that
you
cannot
withdraw
until...
until
you
reach
a
certain
age.
and
if
they're
structured
that
way,
they
would
be
covered.
so
you
had
to
mention
408
in
the...
in
the
exceptions.
what's
wrong
with
that
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
the
government
come
in
here,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity?
we
don't
have
an
amicus
brief
here
from
the
government,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
has
no
position
on
the
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
there...
they
never
go
bankrupt,
so
the
position
they
usually
take
is
against
any
exemption
from
the--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it...
is
it
the
case
that
other
plans
that
are
clearly
covered
by
the
text
of
this
statute
also
permit
early
withdrawal
for
certain
reasons?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
a
single
one
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you'd
say
that
if
one
of
them
did,
it
would
also
not
be
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
assume--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that...
that
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
as
to
why
that
makes
a
difference
with
regard
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
make
sure
that
people
have
money
for
their
retirement,
and
that
if
you
can
withdraw
it
for
any
reason
whatever,
there
is
no
security
that
that
money
will
be
there
for
their
retirement;
whereas
if
you
limit
the
reasons
to
sickness
and...
and
a
certain
other
number
of
emergency
reasons,
the
chances
the
money
will
be
there
for
the
retirement
are
much
higher.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
but
it's
acquired.
say...
say
retirement,
not
old
age.
i
mean,
you
know,
60...
it's
not
that
bad--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
ms....
ms.
karlan
says
she
doesn't
know
of
any...
of
any
ira
that
did
place
a...
a
restriction
which
would
bring
it
within
that
exemption
even
though
the
ordinary
ira
wouldn't
be
within
the
exemption.
do
you
know
of
any
ira,
a
single
ira
that...
that
has
a
provision
in
it
restricting
withdrawal?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can,
but
do...
do
you
know
that
there's...
there's
one
out
there?
i
don't
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
didn't
just
draw
one
up
for
this
case,
did
you?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that...
was
that
an
ira
that
she
had?
it
was
an
ira?
justice
antonin
scalia
plus
10
percent
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
just...
just
like
an
ira.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
just
get...
get
straight
what...
what
the...
what
the
universe
of
plans
we
have
in
front
of
us
here.
do
you
assert
that
there
are
no
other
plans,
clearly
covered
by
this
statute,
that
permit
withdrawal
for
any
reason
but
with
a
penalty?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
permit
withdrawal
for
any
reason
whatever
provided
that
a
penalty
is
paid.
justice
antonin
scalia
none
of
them
is
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
these...
these
other
plans
that
allow
you
to
withdraw
for
certain
reasons
but
not
for
any
reason...
what
happens
if
you
withdraw
for
any
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
sanction
against...
i
mean,
you
just
go
in.
you
withdraw
the
money
for...
for
a
reason
that
is
not
allowed
by
the
employer
plan.
what...
what
is
the
sanction?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
really
have
a
right
to
receive
it
on
account
of
age.
you
have
a
right
to
receive
it
without
a
penalty
on
account
of
age.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
the
right
to
receive
the
money
that
depends
on
your
age.
it's
the
right
to
receive
the
money
without
paying
a
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
a
right
that's
important,
but
it's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
right
to
receive
a
payment
on
account
of,
among
other
things,
age.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
lists
the
other
reasons:
on
account
of
illness,
disability,
death,
age,
or
length
of
service.
and...
and,
you
know,
when
you
have
a
list
like
that,
you
would
think
that
the
right
to
receive
the
money
for
some
other
reason
doesn't...
doesn't
qualify.
i
mean,
i
would
think
that
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or...
or
at
least...
at
least
some
other
reason
that
isn't
closely
related
to
those.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
yes.
you...
you
don't
have
to
make
up
a
hardship.
you
just
say
i
want
the
money.
okay,
you
want
the
money?
here's
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
even
have
to
lie
about
the
hardship.
i
mean--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
in
any
of
these
other
plans,
can
you
get
the
money
so
long
as
you're
willing
to
pay
a
penalty?
justice
antonin
scalia
without
any
qualification
for
disability,
illness.
no.
i
just
want
the
money.
give
me
the
money
and
i'll
pay
you
10
percent.
is
there
any
plan
that
works
like
that?
