ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
justice
stevens,
may
it
please
the
court:
pursuant
to
section
522(d)(10)(e)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
a
debtor's
right
to
receive
a
payment
is
not
exempt
unless
two
requirements
are
met.
first,
the
right
to
receive
the
payment
must
be
on
account
of
illness,
disability,
death,
age
or
length
of
service,
and
the
right
must
come
from
a
specified
similar
plan
or
contract.
because
neither
of
those
elements
is
satisfied
in
this
case,
the
petitioners'
ira's
are
not
exempt.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
yes
and
no,
and
let
me
explain
that.
yes,
they
do
permit
withdrawals
based
upon
certain
factors.
those
are
enumerated
based...
based
upon
each
individual
plan.
however,
they
do
not
permit
withdrawals
for
any
reason
at
any
time
for
any
purpose.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
not
a
single
one
of
them.
now,
of
course,
i've
not
read
every
plan
ever
created,
but
none
of
the
plans
that
i
have
ever
seen,
as
the
specified
plans,
the
pension
plans,
the
profit-sharing
plans,
any
of
those,
allow
withdrawal
for
any
reason
at
any
time.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
that's
correct.
it...
it
is
thought--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--there
are--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--that...
that
is
correct.
the...
there
probably
are
plans
out
there...
once
again,
there
are
so
many
plans.
and
those
are
created
by
financial
institutions,
by
employers,
by
different
entities.
so
therefore
there
are
thousands
of
variations
of
those.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
this
is
different
because
this
is
the
only
kind
of
plan
where
you
can
access
the
funds
at
any
time
for
any
purpose.
it
is
also--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--that's
correct.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
because
the
right
to...
to
receive
the
payment,
the
right
to
access
the
money
at
any
time
exists
no
matter
if
it
is
exercised
or
not,
and
it
does
not
meet
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute
very
specifically--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--i'm
sorry.
yes.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
because
there
is
no
causal
connection
between
any
of
the
factors
that
are
enumerated
in
the
statute
and
the
right
to
receive
the
money.
and
that
is--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--absolutely,
yes,
it
would.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
clearly,
there's
a
point
at
which
it
would
qualify
as
a
prohibition
more
than
just--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--the
reason
for
drawing
the
line
is
because
at
10
percent,
as
the
eighth
circuit
has
stated
in...
in
the
huebner
case,
it...
it
said
that
it's
a
minimal
penalty.
however,
there
is
still
the
unfettered
access
that's
available.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
i
would
assume
as
a
disincentive
to...
to
withdraw,
but
it's
clearly
not
a
prohibition,
such
as
the...
the
parking--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--it
would
not
be
a
prohibition,
but
it
would
operate
more
as
a
prohibition
than
10
percent.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
clearly
that...
it's
a
very
difficult
line
to
draw.
i...
i
can't
make
that
call
at
this
moment,
but--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--but
the...
the
hallmark
difference
here
is
that
it...
it
is
the
only
type
of
account
that
you
can
access
paying
the
penalty
for
any
reason--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--regardless
of
the
specified
reason.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
well,
that...
that's--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--thank
you,
justice
scalia.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
yes.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
yes.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
because
clearly
the...
the
access
of
money
and
the
ability
to
use
it
prior
to
retirement,
just
as...
as
justice
scalia
just
stated,
that
allows
the...
the
debtors
to...
to
access
freely
for
any
purpose,
clearly
not
showing
that...
that
it
would
be
for
retirement
purposes.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
not
necessarily.
the...
the
line
that
we're
really
looking
to
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
direct
causation
factor
between
one
of
the
five
specified
factors
such
as
on...
on
account
of
factors,
age,
disability,
death,
length
of
service,
and
the
right
to
receive
the
payment.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
well--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--and
that's
typically--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--well,
the...
the
ability
to
access
the
funds,
oftentimes
with
termination,
has
to
do
with
the
length
of
service,
the
years
in
service
because
they
accumulate
and
oftentimes
are
not
payable
at
the
full
percentage.
they're
not
fully
vested
until
that
time.
also,
with
the...
when
there
are
multiple
factors
existing
in
the
right
to
receive
the
payments,
each
multiple
factor
can
be
a
cause
of
the...
of
the
ability
to
reach
the
money.
when
there
are
no
meaningful
factors
imposed,
though--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--i
understand
that...
that
may
appear
to
be
correct,
but
the
problem
with
that
is
that
as...
taxpayer
status
is
not
the
hallmark
in
this
case
of
if
it
is
or
is
not
exempt.
therefore,
all
types
of
accounts,
whether
they
are
truly
retirement
accounts
or...
or
if
they're
just
savings
accounts,
could
potentially
qualify
under
this
statute.
if...
if
you
want
to
open
it
up
and...
and
allow
all
kinds
of
accounts
to
be
exemptible
under
522(d)(10)(e),
the
problem
is
that
there
is
no
limit
on
what
can
be
potentially
exempt
under
that
statute.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
that's
correct.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
the
section
408
reference
is...
does
not
in
any
way
expand
the
exemption.
in
fact,
it
is
a
further
condition
to
place
on
the...
the
exemption.
first
of
all,
section
408
sets
out
only
the
minimum
requirements
for
an
ira
to
qualify
as
a...
as
a
tax-favored
plan.
that--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--absolutely.
those
are
customizable
plans.
any
person
can
go
into--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--i...
i
do
know
of
several
out
there.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
i
did
not
create
one
for
this
case.
no,
i
did
not.
but
they...
they
definitely
exist.
in
fact,
in
the
andersen
case
out
of
the
eighth
circuit
bankruptcy
appellate
panel,
the
debtor
had
an
annuity
and
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition,
she
elected
that
she
would
only
receive
periodic
payments
based
upon
her
age,
and
that
was
found
to
be
exempt
by
the
bankruptcy
appellate
panel
because
that
qualified.
the
payments
were
based
upon
her
age,
and
it
was
then
a
similar
plan
because
she
could
not
access
the
funds
at
any
time
but
only
for
the
specified
reason
such
as
age.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
my
understanding
is,
yes,
it
was
under
section
408(b)
was...
that's
my
understanding
based
upon
that
case.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
i...
i
do
not
know
if
that
one
specifically
was,
but
no.
these
have
not
been
set
up
through--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--clearly
to
protect
the
money
potentially
for
retirement
and...
and
just
as--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--that's--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--well,
that
would
potentially
be
a
motivation
because
clearly
the
money
is
there
readily
accessible
at
any
time
to...
to
buy
anything
that
the
debtor
chooses
throughout
their
life.
so
someone
who's
30
or
40
years
old
can
liquidate
their...
their
ira
account,
whereas
with
a
pension
or
profit-sharing
plan,
they
don't
have
that
kind
of
access--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--well,
the...
the
name
is
clearly
not
determinative.
also,
congress
in
the...
in
the--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--yes.
first
of
all,
congress
did
historically
reject,
first
of
all,
just
tax-favored
status
overall,
such
as
what
an
ira
account
is.
an
ira
account
is
set
up
just
for
tax-favored
status.
congress
set
forth,
instead,
the
(d)(10)(e)...
522(d)(10)(e)
requirements
that...
that
are
much
more
stringent
in
the
requirements
of
the
traditional
ira.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
that's
a
misnomer
that
that's
a...
a
right
to
payment.
that
is
rather
the
right
to
borrow
as
a
loan.
and
a
loan
is
very
different
than
a
right
to
payment.
they
have
the
right
to
borrow
the
funds.
however...
for
example,
in
the
new
york
police
department
pension
plan,
which
she
referenced
in
the
reply
brief,
the
police
officers
can
borrow
up
to
90
percent
of
their
pension
plan
funds.
however,
they...
as
long
as
they're
employed
there,
they
have
to
continue
to
repay
that.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
there
is
a
10
percent
penalty.
however,
as
the
bankruptcy--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--that
would
be
correct.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
that's
correct.
however--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--but...
but
this
is
in
the
bankruptcy
context,
which
makes
it
completely
different.
the
bankruptcy
filing
of
a
chapter
vii
bankruptcy
is
a
picture
in
time.
at
the
time
that
the
debtor
files
the
bankruptcy
petition,
you
look
to
the
assets
that
the
debtor
has
possession
of
and
the
interest
that
the
debtor
has
at
that
moment.
there's
also,
for
some
things,
a
1-year
look-back
period.
but
because
it's
a
picture
in
time,
it's
what
the...
the
debtor
can
reach
is
what
the...
the
bankruptcy
trustee
looks
to,
the
types
of
assets
that...
that
the
debtor
owns.
this
is
very
different
than
the
pension
plan
which,
of
course,
the
debtor
could
not
have...
have
exhausted
to
pay
the
creditors
prior
to
filing
the
bankruptcy,
but
any
other
type
of
account
would
be
there,
would
be
present
at
the
retirement.
but
because
they
could
have
liquidated
their
ira's
to
pay
off
their
creditors
prior
to
filing
the
bankruptcy,
the
bankruptcy
trustee
steps
into
the
shoes
of
that
debtor
and
has
the
ability
to
reach
the
funds
that
the
debtor
can
potentially
reach.
there
are
other
exemptions,
of
course,
set
forth
in...
in
section
522(d),
you
know,
for
a
home
or
jewelry,
but
the
assets
that
are
not
exempt
are
readily
available
to
repay
creditors,
for...
for
the
benefit
of
the
creditors.
therefore,
that...
that
makes
it
significantly--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
that's
correct.
yes,
they
do.
they
do.
additionally,
the
petitioners'
ira's
are...
by
allowing
unfettered
access,
are
unlike
any
of
the
other
plans
because
the
petitioners'
standard
ira
is
much
more
like
a
savings
account.
it's
not
any
form
of
deferred
compensation.
they
can't
look
to
that
to
fill
a
salary
void
after
they
retire
because
the
money
may
not
be
there.
unlike
in
the
pension
plans
or
a
profit-sharing
plan,
they
could
have
liquidated
those
funds
prior
to
their
reaching
any
age
or
any
illness
that...
that
may
befall
them.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
but
the...
the
key
here--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--that's
correct.
none
of
the
specified
plans
listed,
the...
the
ones
enumerated.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
that's
correct.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
none
of
them
is
like
that.
they
all
have
specific
factors.
there
has
to
be
a
causal
connection
between
the
ability
to
access
the
money.
additionally,
it's
very
important
that...
that
an
account
or
plan
that
qualifies
under
the
statute...
it
has
to
be
determined
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
and
there's
no
question
that
there
are
definitely
ira's
that...
that
could
and
do
qualify
for
this
exemption.
it
is,
instead,
that--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--that's
not...
that's
not
correct.
there
are
many
customizable
products
that
are...
are
out
there.
in
fact,
for
example,
when
employers
set
up
different
kinds
of
plans
for
their
employees,
they
go
and
they
can
choose
from
many
different
options.
for
example,
they
can
choose
if
they
even
have
a...
a
loan
provision
built
into
a...
a
401(k)
or
a
pension
plan,
just
like
the
ira.
they...
they
can
be
customized
because
section
408
only
sets
forth
the
minimum
requirements
for
it
to
qualify
for
tax-favored
status.
that...
that
is
an
internal
revenue
code
section,
and
it
does
not
in
any
way
prohibit
additional
factors
being
placed
into
the
plan.
rather,
it
allows
the...
the
individual
or
the
employer
because
some...
there
are
two
different
types
of
ira's
that
can
be
set
up
by
an
employer...
to
go
and
customize
those
so
that
they
could
potentially
meet
the
statutory
requirements.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
that--
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
--my
understanding
is
that...
is
that
you
cannot
access
the
funds
for
a
reason
not
allowed
by
those
plans,
that
that
is
prohibited.
and
that...
that
is
similar
to
ms.
andersen's
ira
in
the
bankruptcy
appellate
panel
case.
she
could
no
longer
reach
the
funds
in
the...
she
could
no
longer
reach
the
corpus
of
the
account.
the...
the
lump
sum
of
money
was
there
for
her
retirement
years.
whereas,
in
the
ira
situation,
the
money
is
not
protected
at
any
time.
there's
no
prohibition
at
all
whatsoever
on
withdrawing
the
funds
from
the
account
other
than
the
payment
of
the
penalty.
but
whether
an
account
or
plan
qualifies
under
the
statute,
it...
it...
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
plan
on
a
plan-by-plan
basis.
the
petitioners'
argument
renders
the
terms
of
the
statute
superfluous
because,
first
of
all,
it
is
dissimilar
from
the
enumerated
plans,
and
secondly,
it
is
not
on
account
of
any
factors
that
the
money
can
be
reached.
the
right
to
receive
the
payment
is
not
based
upon
any
factor
other
than
the...
the
account
holder
wanting
to
withdraw
the
funds.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
yes,
it
is.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
that's
correct.
unless
you
have...
or
another
factor
such
as
for
education
or
for
a
home
loan,
something
like
that.
there
are
several
different
reasons
that
you
can...
you
can
reach
the
money
and
not
pay
a
penalty.
however,
the
penalty
is
not...
is
not
the
deciding
factor.
it's
their
ability
to
access
the
funds
at
any
time
that...
that
makes
that
a
right
of
payment.
it's
not
a
right
of
payment
without
a
penalty.
it's
just
that
the
right
to
payment
exists
at
all
times.
ms.
colli
c.
mckiever
that...
that...
that
is...
appears
to
be
correct.
i
don't
have
those
exact
statistics,
but
yes,
that...
that
appears
to
be
correct,
that
they
have...
that
they
may
not
exercise
that
at...
in
great
numbers.
first
of
all,
going
back
to
the
causation
factor
about
the...
the
ability
of
the
debtors
to
withdraw
the
funds
for
any
reason
or
no
reason,
this
court
in
the
203
north
lasalle
case
determined
that
on
account
of
must
mean
because
of,
and
that...
that
is
a
key
point
here
because
if
the
debtors
can
reach
the
funds
for
any
reason,
it
is
not
because
of
any
other
factor.
and
in
the
lasalle
case,
this
court
found
that
that
reading,
the
because
of
reading,
absolutely
applies
to
this
section
of
the...
the
bankruptcy
code,
that
means
that
the
result
is
that
a
direct
causal
connection
is
required
between
the
right
to
receive
the
payment
in
the
on
account
of
requirements.
in...
in
this
case
there
is
no
causal
connection
whatsoever
between
the
right
to
receive

that's
correct.
there
are,
of
course,
always
some
other
factors,
such
as
you
have
to
first
deposit
the
money,
you
have
to
become
eligible.
but
once
those
barriers
are
passed,
then...
then
the
right
to
receive
the
payment
has
to
be
at
least...
one
of
the
causes
must
be
one
of
these
factors.
and
it
has
to
be
enumerated
in
the
plan.
it
cannot
be
for
any
reason,
but
must
be
an
enumerated
reason
in
the
plan.
and
the...
with
the
penalty,
only
the
avoidance
of
a
penalty
is
based
upon
the...
the
age
of
the
debtor
or
the...
or
any
of
the
factors.

section
522(d)(10)(e)
is
void
of
any
reference
to
the
tax
status
or
to
the
right
to
receive
the
payment
without
penalty.
it's
only
the
right
to
receive
the
payment
overall.
ms.

only
to
the
extent
that...
that
they
are
not
payable
for
any
of
the
reasons
enumerated
in
the
statute.
if...
if
they
are
available
for
payment
at
any
time
for
any
reason,
then...
then
they
would
not
qualify.
but
the
specified
accounts,
so
long
as
they're
payable
for...
for
one
of
the
factors
and
that
there's
a
direct
nexus
between
the
right
to
receive
the
payment
and...
and
the
factors,
then...
then
they
would
qualify
for
the
exemption.
it
is
not,
by
any
stretch,
all
ira's.
it
is
just
the
types
that...
currently
that
the
petitioners
would
have
or
that
people
would
have
that
would
allow
the
access
at
any
time
for
any
purpose.
so
it's
not
that
the
trustee
is
looking
to
have
ira's
not
be
eligible
for
exemption.
it's
just
the
types
of
accounts
from
which
all
the
funds
can
be
withdrawn
at
any
time
for
any
purpose.
there
are
many
qualifying
ira's
that
do
exist,
that
can
exist.
it's
just
that
people
have
set
these
up
from
standard
plans
allowing
them
access.
whether
they
access
the
funds
or
not
is
not
the
key,
but
the
ability
to
access
the
money
because
it
doesn't
meet
the
statutory
requirements.
there
are
several
ira's,
though,
that
can
and
do
meet
the
statutory
requirements.
it's
just
that
the
petitioners'
don't.
the
case
law
in
the
eighth
circuit
was
well
settled,
prior
to
the
filing
of
this
bankruptcy,
that
for
approximately
12
years,
that
the
definition
of
similar
plan
or
contract
did
not
include
ira's
such
as
this,
and
that
the
on
account
of
factors
had
to
be
satisfied
to
claim
this
exemption.
the...
the
debtors
knew
or...
or
potentially
should
have
known
that...
that
their
ira's
were
likely
not
exempt
out
of
eighth
circuit
at
the
time
that
they
filed
because
of
the
way
that...
that
these
had
been
construed
for
a
long
period
of
time.
so
that
they
could
have
set
up
accounts
that
did
qualify
for
such
exemption,
but...
but
they
did
not
restrict
their
access
in
that
way.
thank
you.
