justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but...
but
it
is
true
you
have
a
strong
textual--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
was
a
little
bit
surprised
at
your
opening
because
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
strong
textual
argument
you're
now
defending.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
does
a
holistic
reading
mean?
can
you
stay
within
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--text
and
still
be
holistic?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
antonym
would
be
parsimonious
or
something
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let...
let
me
ask--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--ask
you
this.
the...
the
statute
does
say
that
the
right
to
receive
a
payment
is
on
account
of
age,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
an
argument
somewhat
in
respondent's
favor
because
the...
the
payment
has
to
be
triggered
by
the
age,
if
you
read
it
that
way,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
fair
way
to
read
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right,
and
that's
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what...
what
do
the
courts
do
if
they
say,
well,
my
client
might
be
ill
or
something
like
that?
it
seems
to
me--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no,
no.
they...
they
say
my
client
is
able-bodied
now,
but
we...
we
need
something
because...
i
don't
know...
there's
a
history
of
family
illness
or
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
don't
have
your
answer
to
the
problem
that
bothered
me
at
the
first.
how...
how
do
you
reconcile
your
positions
with
on
account
of
language?
if
the...
if
your
clients
can
take
the
money...
just
take
the
money
out
of
the
ira
at
any
time,
then
why
is
it
on
account
of
age?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
say
that
payment
doesn't...
on
account
of
doesn't
modify
payment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
think
the
logical
reading
is
that
it...
it
modifies
payment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but...
but
there
still
is
a
right
to
take
payments
at
any
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
then
you're...
you're--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--under
that,
you're
giving
the...
the
language
that
follows
it
no
meaning.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
that's
just
like
a
savings
account.
