justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
problem
for
the
court
below
was
that
the
person
covered
can
ask
for
it
in
a
lump
sum
and
pay
a
penalty.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
that
isn't
then
on
the
basis
of
age.
am
i
right?
is
that...
that
was
the
problem
the
court
had
below.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
that
was
what
i
was
going...
aren't
most
of
the
pension
profit-sharing,
stock
bonus
plans,
and
annuities
similar
to
the
ira's
in
terms
of
allowing
withdrawal
on
the
payment
of
a
penalty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
i
thought
they
were
all
in
the
same
boat.
so
what
the
effect
of
this
rule
is...
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
that
they
would
all
fail
to
qualify
under
the
bankruptcy--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--oh,
it's
the
eighth
circuit.
excuse
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
karlan,
let
me
ask
something
about
that
very
point
because
the
statute
says
that
to
the
extent
reasonably
necessary
for
the
support
of
the
debtor
it's
allowable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
aware
of
cases
where
the
bankruptcy
court
has
said,
well,
you
don't
need
all
that
money?
that's
a
big
plan.
you
don't
need
all
that.
we'll
just
let
you
deduct
x
amount.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
typically
these
plans
like
401(k)
plans
permit
hardship
withdrawals,
and
other
plans
that
are
mentioned
in
the
act
allow
withdrawals
for
medical
reasons
or
to
buy
housing
or
something
like
that.
i
mean,
you...
we
would
just
have
endless
cases
trying
to
figure
out
what
qualifies
and
what
doesn't.
it
seems
like
such
a
hard
line
for
you
to
try
to
draw
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
every
plan
that
i
know
of
allows
withdrawal
if
you
terminate
employment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
fact,
that's
what
happened
to
these
people.
so
i
just
don't
see
how
your
argument
is
going
to
work.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
it
simpler
to
just
recognize
that
these
plans
are
covered
despite
the
right
to
withdraw
and
then
rely
on
the
provision
in
the
statute
that
only
permits
the
deduction
to
the
extent
reasonably
necessary
for
the
support?
i
mean,
that...
that
seems
to
me
a
fall-back
position
that's
provided
for
in
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
well,
obviously,
it's...
it's
governed
by
the
statutory
provision
that
it
has
to
be
a
stock
bonus,
pension,
profit-sharing,
annuity,
or
similar
plan
or
contract
on
account
of,
and
so
on.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
includes
ira's
apparently
because
of
the
last
provision
in
the
statute
referring
back
to
individual
retirement
acts
under
section
408
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
true
that
none
of
them
give
unfettered
access?
they're
all
qualified
in
some
fashion.
do
you
agree
with
that?
