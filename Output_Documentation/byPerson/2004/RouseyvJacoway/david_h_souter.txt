justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
isn't
it
a
right
on
account
of?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
because
the
savings
account
doesn't
have...
i
mean,
the
savings
account
doesn't
have
the...
the
penalty.
isn't
your
argument
that
you've
got
to
read
the
right
as
meaning
a
right
without
penalty,
because
if
you
don't
read
it
that
way,
then
every
one
of
these
other
retirement
instruments
is
likewise
going
to
fail?
isn't
that
your...
your
strong
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do...
do
we
know
that?
i
mean,
couldn't
someone...
i...
i
don't
think
this
is
a
very
plausible
basis
for
construing
the
statute,
but
just
as
a
technical
matter,
couldn't
someone
go
to
the
bank
or
brokerage
firm
and
say
i
want
to
set
up
an
ira,
but
i
want
the
ira
to
be,
in...
in
effect,
like
an
irrevocable
trust
in
which
withdrawals
can
only
be
made
on
certain,
specific
conditions?
and
couldn't
someone,
using
both
the
ira
mechanism
and
a
state
irrevocable
trust
document,
create
an
ira
that
would
be
as
restricted
as...
as
the
circuit
suggested
it
might
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
and
just
nail
down
one
lose
end
in...
in
an
answer
that
you...
you
gave
to
my
question,
can
you
set
up
a
kind
of
irrevocable?
i
assume
clearly
from
what
you
say
is
that
there
is
not
only
no
statute,
but
no
irs
reg
or
ruling
to
the
effect
that
you
can
make
your
ira
terms
more
restrictive
without
jeopardizing
your
qualification.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it...
in...
in
answering
justice
scalia,
i
take
it
from
what
you
didn't
say
that
none
of
the...
we'll
call
them
kind
of
the
paradigm
example
plans
are,
however,
as...
as
restricted
as
the
language
in
this...
the
statute
would
suggest
that
it
had
to
be
if
you
read
it
in
a...
in
a
very
literal
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
they're
all
a
little
bit
sinful,
at
least,
even
if
they're
not
as
sinful
as...
as
you
say
the...
the
401...
the...
the
ira
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
attachment
of
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if...
if
that
is
going
to
be
your
criterion,
the...
the
total
freedom
for
any
purpose,
then
why,
if
we
accept
your
argument,
why...
why
don't
we
face
sort
of
a
daunting
run
or
the
courts
face
sort
of
daunting
future?
because
the...
the
question
then
is
going
to
be,
well,
what
purposes
are
sufficiently
close
to
old
age
to...
to
allow
for
a
continued
exemption
and
how
free
may
the
purposes
be
before
a
plan
falls
into
the
ira
category.
you
told
us
a
few
moments
ago...
and
i'm
sure
you...
you
were
right...
that
the
kind
of
the
paradigm
example
plans
vary
enormously
depending
on
the
terms
in
which
employers
set
them
up.
so
if...
if
we
say
that
the...
the
dividing
line
is
going
to
be
between
plans
under
which
withdrawal
can
be
for
any
purpose
versus
plans
in
which
withdrawal
is
going
to
be
somehow
limited,
then
we're
going
to
have
to
litigate
an
awful
lot
of
plans.
aren't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me...
let
me
ask
you.
maybe
this
is
irrelevant,
but
were...
were
these
restrictive
ira's
that
you're
aware
of
set
up
under
those
terms
in
contemplation
of
bankruptcy?
if
the
answer
is
no,
why
would
anyone
so
restrict
his...
his
ira?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why...
why
would
anyone
do
that?
they're...
they're
qualified
without
these
restrictions.
why
would
anyone
want
to
cut
off
his...
his
rights
to...
to
withdraw?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
like
setting
up
a
personal
spendthrift
trust?
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
want
to
make
it
tough
so
that
i...
i
will
not
be
tempted
to
withdraw.
is
that
the
motivation?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
if
they
don't
repay
it?
what's
the
sanction?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what...
where...
where
would
the...
where
would
the
principal
repayment
come
from?
i
assume
it
would
come
from
deducting
whatever
the
balance
was
from
the...
the
person's
account.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
we
call
it...
the...
the
loan
feature
then
boils
down
to
a...
a
withdrawal
subject
to
a
periodic
repayment
obligation,
but
if
that
obligation
is
not
satisfied,
the
bottom
line
will
be
exactly
like
a
withdrawal
because
they
will
simply
deduct
whatever
the
balance
is
from
the
person's
rights
under
the
plan.
justice
david
h.
souter
subject
to
the
10
percent
if
the
bankruptcy
trustee
does
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
penalty
still
has
to
be
paid
even
if
it's
the
trustee
who
takes
money
out
to
pay
the
creditors,
on
your
view.
