justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
at
the
termination
of
their
employment
petitioner
rouseys'
each
took
a
lump
sum
distribution
from
their
employers
bounds
of
pension
plans.
they
rolled
over
these
sums
in
to
two
individual
retirement
accounts.
several
years
later
the
rouseys
filed
for
bankruptcy
under
chapter
7
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
in
their
bankruptcy
petitioner
rouseys
sought
to
protect
their
iras
from
their
creditors
by
claiming
that
they
were
exempt
from
the
bankruptcy
estate
under
11
u.s.c.
section
522(d)(10)(e).
this
provision
permits
the
exemption
of
the
right
to
receive
payment
from
a
plan
or
a
contract
that
is
similar
to
stock,
bonus,
pension,
profit
sharing,
or
annuity
plans.
where
that
right
to
receive
payment
is
on
account
of
illness,
disability,
death
or
age
or
length
of
service.
the
bankruptcy
trustee
respondent
jill
jacoway
filed
a
motion
objecting
to
the
exemption
of
the
rouseys'
iras
under
this
provison
and
seeking
their
turnover.
the
bankruptcy
court
granted
jacoway's
motion.
the
rouseys
appealed.
the
bankruptcy
appellate
panel
for
the
eight
circuit
affirmed.
the
rouseys
again
appealed
and
the
eight
circuit
likewise
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
conclude
that
the
rouseys'
right
to
receive
payment
from
their
iraâ€™s
is
a
right
to
receive
payment
on
account
of
age.
under
section
408(a)(4)
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
rouseys
have
a
non
forfeitable
right
to
the
entire
balance
contained
in
their
iras.
the
internal
revenue
code
however
also
restricts
the
rouseys'
ability
to
withdraw
money
from
their
iras
prior
to
reaching
age
59-and-a-half
by
imposing
a
10%
penalty
on
such
withdrawals.
this
penalty
is
substantial
and
effectively
prevents
the
rouseys'
from
accessing
the
entire
balance
in
their
iras.
the
penalty
is
removed
once
the
rouseys
reached
age
59-and-a-half.
thus,
we
conclude
that
the
rouseys
have
a
right
to
receive
payment
on
account
of
age.
we
also
conclude
that
the
iras
are
similar
plans
or
contracts
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
specified
plans,
the
stock
bonus,
pension,
profit
sharing,
or
annuity
plans
share
one
common
feature.
they
are
substitute
for
wages
earned
as
salary
or
hourly
compensation.
iras
likewise
provide
such
an
income
substitute.
because
the
iras
are
similar
plans
or
contract
and
provide
a
right
to
receive
payment
on
account
of
age,
we
conclude
that
they
can
be
exempted
from
the
bankruptcy
estate
under
section
522(d)(10)(e).
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
