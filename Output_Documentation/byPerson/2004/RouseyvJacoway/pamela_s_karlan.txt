ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
yesterday
in
koons
buick
against
nigh,
this
court
emphasized
once
again
that
statutory
interpretation
is
a
holistic
process
based
on
common
sense,
that
the
reading
of
the
statute
should
look
at
all
the
words
to
avoid
a
passing
strange
or
an
anomalous
result
when
the
text
does
not
dictate
it
and
the
statutory
history
suggests
otherwise.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
but
actually,
justice
scalia,
i
think
even
you
will
find
our
case
more
appealing.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
we
have
an
excellent
textual
argument.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
we
do.
a
holistic
reading
of
the
text
shows
that
section
522(d)(10)(e)
of
the
bankruptcy
code--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--absolutely.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i'm
not
going
to
look
outside
the
text
at
all.
a
holistic
reading
of
section
522(d)(10)(e)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
is
on...
in
the
petitioners'
brief
at
pages
1
through
2--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
think
it
means
read
all
the
words
in
the
sense
that
makes
the
most
sense
to
you
rather
than
plucking
words
at
random
or
rather
than
looking
at
a
word
artificially.
for
example,
when
you
look
at
a
phrase
like
on
account
of
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
as
the
court
did
in
north
lasalle,
account
means
a
lot
of
different
things,
but
there
it
clearly
meant
because
of,
as
it
does
in
this
statute.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
think
it'd
be
partial,
but
i'm
not
sure.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
sure.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
and
i
think
payments
are
triggered
by
age
because
section
522(d)(10)(e)
is
a
statute
eminently
about
the
protection
in
bankruptcy
of
retirement
payments.
for
individuals--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes,
that's
the
problem
the
court
had
below.
i
think
it's
an
illusory
problem
for
the
following
reason.
it's
clear
that
the
right
to
receive
full
enjoyment
of
payments
under
an
ira
does
not
attach
until
one
of
the
triggering
events
occurs.
the
trigger
events
are
age
59
and
a
half,
disability,
illness,
or
for
the
estate,
death.
and
that's
the
right
that
we're
talking
about
here,
and
that's
why--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that's
correct,
but
the
10
percent
tax
here
is
designed
and
does,
in
fact,
operate
as
a
deterrent
and
a
penalty.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
justice
scalia,
the
way
that
i
would
view
that
is
prior
to
59
and
a
half,
you
pay
a
penalty.
and
congress
put
that
penalty
in
there
because
the
holistic
sense,
the
full
reading
of
section
522(d)(10)(e)
is
it
is
designed
to
protect
retirement
savings,
replacement
income
of
the
elderly,
the
disabled,
or
ill
people,
once
they
get
to
the
point
where
those
triggering
events,
which
are
in
522(d)(10)(e),
occur.
those
are
the
same
triggering
events--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--northrop
grumman's
policy
is
to
require
individuals
who
leave
the
company's
employment
to
roll
their
pension
plans
into
an
ira.
the
rouseys
tried
to
get
work
in
arkansas
when
they
moved
there.
had
they
gotten
a
job
there
that
they
were
able
to
keep,
which
they
were
unable
to
do
because
of
their
health,
they
could
have
rolled
that
money
back
into
an
undeniably,
completely
exemptible
pension
plan.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
this
employer
did
not
permit
individuals
to
keep
the
money
in
the
plan.
they
were
told
they
had
to
remove
the
money
when
they
lost
their
jobs.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
apparently
so.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
let
me
give
you
a
couple--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--let
me
give
you
a
couple
of
examples--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that
i
think
will
be
quite
familiar.
a
401(k)
plan
allows
you
to
get
access
to
money
before
you
turn
59
and
a
half
on
account
of
hardship,
and
you
pay
a
10
percent
tax
penalty
if
you
do
so.
the
federal
government's
thrift
savings
plan
for
federal
employees
allows
you
to
take
a
loan
out
of
the
plan
and
to
pay
the
interest
back
into
your
own
account
before
you
turn
59
and
a
half,
thereby
essentially
giving
you
free
use
of
the
money.
if
you
don't
pay
the
loan
back,
it's
then
treated
as
a...
as
a
distribution,
and
you
pay
the
10
percent
tax
penalty
on
it.
so
that
if
you
read
this
statute
to...
not
to
include
ira's,
to
deny
exemption
to
ira's,
you
read
this
statute
to
deny
exemption
to
virtually
all
of
the
modern
forms
of
defined
contribution
pension
plans
or
savings
plans.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
that's
correct.
you
would
render
section
522(d)(10)(e)
essentially
a
nullity.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes.
i...
i
can
see
why
you
might
have
thought
it
was
the
ninth
circuit.
[laughter]
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
in
the
cilek
case
from
the
seventh
circuit,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
the
court
there
cited
statistics
that
suggested
it
was
between
1.2
and
1.7
percent
of
funds
in
ira's
were
removed
early
under
the
penalty
process.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
it
would
be
because
it's
the
right
to
the
future
payments
and
not
just
the
present
payments,
justice
breyer.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
but
in
order
to
protect
the
ability
to
take
money
out
after
someone
turns
59,
you
have
to
protect
the
corpus
of
the
ira
now
because
otherwise,
when
he
turns
59
and
a
half,
there
won't
be
any
money
there
for
him
to
take
out.
and
that's
why
the
exemption
extends
not
just
to
present
payments,
as
the
third
circuit
erroneously
held,
but
also
to
the
corpus
when
it
is
necessary
for
the
support
of
the
debtor.
and
i
can't
emphasize--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
we
cite
a
number
of
them
in
both
the
opening
brief
and
in
the
yellow
brief
on
pages
19
through...
to
20,
i
think
is
where
we...
where
we
talk
about--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
the
claim
was
all
that
all
of
that
was
necessary.
if
i
could
give
an
example
that
i
think
justice
o'connor
might
find
instructive
here.
when
a
debtor,
for
example,
is
40
years
old,
they
generally
require
turnover
of
the
entire
ira
because
people
have
time
to
earn
the
money
back
again.
when
the
debtor
has
other
retirement
savings,
for
example,
in
a
case
from
virginia
called
abate,
because
the
person
also
had
a
401(k)
plan,
they
were
required
to
turn
over
the
entire
ira.
when
a
debtor
is
able
to
work,
even
if
the
debtor
is
in
his
or
her
50's,
courts
will
often
require
exclusion
of
at...
will
also
require
turnover
of
at
least
part
of
the
ira.
in
this
case--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
if
the
client
is
ill
now,
they
get
to
keep
it--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--there
isn't
a
reported
case
that
talks
about
the
possibility
of
future
illness
as
a
reason
of
exempting
the
money.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
would
say
at
the
1
percent
and
80
percent
of
the
people
are
taking
the
money
out,
it
wouldn't
operate
really
as
a
retirement
plan
anymore.
but
if
i
can
give
another
statistic
that
might
be
helpful
in
thinking
about
this.
18
percent
of
the
participants
in
large
401(k)
plans
who
are
under
the
age
of
50
are
taking
loans
out
against
those
plans
today.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
18
percent
in
one
of
the
surveys.
and
yet,
those
plans
are
undeniably,
absolutely
exempt
under
the
bankruptcy--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
but
the
loans
because...
for
example,
in
the
federal
thrift
savings
plan,
the
interest
is
being
paid
back
into
your
own
account,
it's
essentially
as
close
to
taking
out
the
money
as
you
can
get.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
it...
it's
not
the...
if
you
look
at
the
statute...
and
let
me
just
work
my
way
through
it
with
you.
it's
the
right
to
a
payment
under
a
stock
bonus,
profit-sharing,
annuity,
or
similar
plan
on
account
of
illness.
and
the
question
is
what
does
on
account
of
modify
there.
i
think
the
most
natural
and
sensible
reading
of
the
statute
is
a
plan
that
is
because
of
age,
a
plan
that
is
because
of
disability,
and
the
like.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
don't...
i
don't
think
you
need
to
read
it
that
way,
and
i
think
the
most
sensible
reading
here,
especially
given
that
the
statute--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
it
does,
but
even
if
it
did,
your
honor--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
this
is
again...
i
know
you
dissented
yesterday,
but
this
is
a
less
than
meticulously
crafted
statute.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
okay.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
think
what
on
account
of
modifies
here
is
the
kind
of
plan
out
of
which
the
payment
is
coming.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
there
are
a
variety
of
plans,
stock
bonus,
pension--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
plans--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
i
think
you
can
read
it
either
way
and
you'll
get
to
exactly
the
same
result.
so
let
me
read
it
the
way
that
you've
been
reading
it,
which
is
if
you
want
to
protect
the
ability
of
people
who
have
ira's
to
withdraw
money
on
account
of
age,
you
have
to
protect
the
ira
now
or
there
will
be
no
money
in
it
for
them
to
exercise
their
right
to
withdraw
on
account
of
age.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
justice...
justice
kennedy,
we
don't
believe--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that
that's
actually
a
right.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
that's
what
i'm
doing
here,
and
the
reason
i
don't
think
that's
what
i'm
doing
is
because
this
statute
clearly
refers
to
ira's
by
name
as
one
of
the
plans
that's
entitled
to
exemption.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
that's...
that's
our
strong
point
and
we're
sticking
with
it.
[laughter]
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
it's
not
a
right,
as
we
say
in
the
reply
brief,
to
park
on
the
sidewalk
because
if
you
pay
the
parking
ticket,
you
can
park
there.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
and
i
think
no
matter
how--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--thank
you.
[laughter]
no
matter
how
you
read
the
statute,
it's
designed
to
cover
ira's,
and
any
reading
of
the
statute
that
ends
up
not
covering
ira's
will
also
not
cover
many
of
the
other--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--they
did,
justice
ginsburg.
they
did
in
the
last
line
of
the
statute.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
my
best
guess
as
to
why
they
didn't
do
that
is
they
started
drafting
the
exemptions
statute
in
1973
and
they
enacted
ira's
in
1974,
so
they
stuck
it
in
at
the
end
of
the
list.
that's
my
best
guess.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
what's
wrong
with
that,
justice
scalia,
is
that
all
ira's
are
designed
and
they're
administered
on
forms
that
the
internal
revenue
service
sets
out
and
you
buy
the
forms
to
allow
for
early
withdrawal.
so
under
their
theory,
there
has...
there
is
not
now
and
there
has
never
been
a
single
ira
anywhere
in
the
united
states--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that
had
that
inability
to
take
the
money
out
subject
to
penalty
prior
to
the
age
59
and
a
half.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
don't
necessarily
think
so
for
the
following
reason.
ira's
are
off-the-rack
products.
they're
a
basic
consumer
product
that
40
million
people
buy.
people
don't
usually
negotiate
the
terms.
if
you
did
negotiate
the
terms,
though,
here's
the
second
problem.
anytime
you
deviate
from
the
form
that
the
internal
revenue
service
gives
you,
which
also
gives
you
these
rights
to
withdraw
early
subject
to
penalty,
you
run
the
risk
that
your
plan
will
then
be
held
to
be
a
nonqualifying
plan
under
section
408
of
the
tax
code.
you
then
lose
the
ability
to
deduct
the
contributions
going
in.
you
then
lose
the
ability
to
defer
the
payments
on
the
income
as
it
accrues
in
the
account.
now,
to
answer
the
last
part
of
your
question,
one
of
the
things
that
has
occurred
over
the
last,
say,
5
to
10
years
is
more
and
more
states
are
passing
laws
that
essentially
protect
ira's
in
bankruptcy
and
out,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
from
any
attachment
by
creditors.
why
do
they
do
that?
because
they
recognize
that
ira's
are
a
fundamental
piece
of
the
retirement
system
today.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct,
but
only
four
states
offer
no
protection
to
ira's
from
creditors
the
other--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--46
states
offer
some
kind
of
protection.
23
states
protect
them
without
limit
in
bankruptcy
and
out.
6
of
them
protect
them
inside
of
bankruptcy
using
the
state
exemptions
as
long
as
the
amount
is
reasonable
and
necessary
for
the
debtor's
support.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
no.
23
of
them
would
protect
all
ira's.
6
would
protect
all
ira's
if
the
money
in
them
is
necessary
to
the
debtor's
support,
an
additional
6.
6
more
would
protect
all
the
money
in
an
ira
as
long
as
it
was
deposited
120
days
or
a
year
or
3
years
before
the
debtor
filed
for
bankruptcy.
3
of
them
will
protect
all
ira's
up
to
a
dollar
amount.
in
nevada,
the
dollar
amount
is
$500,000.
8
states
use,
as
their
state
exemption
law,
an
ira
that...
a
statute
that
has
exactly
the
same
language
as
the
federal
statute.
6
of
those
state
statutes
have
been
interpreted
by
federal
courts
to
protect
ira's.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
there's
a...
there's
a
weird
anomaly
in
arkansas,
your
honor,
which
is
arkansas
law
does,
in
fact,
protect
ira's,
but
the
federal
bankruptcy
courts
in
arkansas
have
interpreted
that
law
only
to
protect
the
ira
up
to
$500
because
of
a
provision
in
the
arkansas
constitution,
article
9,
section
2,
that
means
that
you
can
only
save
up
to
$500.
so
any
bankrupt
person
in
arkansas
who
wants
to
keep
any
money
in
his...
in
his
ira
has
to
elect
the
federal
exemptions
rather
than
electing
the
state
exemptions.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
the
bankruptcy
court
did
not
rule
on
our
claim
that
it
was
all
reasonably
necessary
because
they
decided
first
that
ira's
didn't
come
within
the
meaning
of
section
522.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
if
you
take,
say,
$55,000
and
you
ask
what
sort
of
annuity
could
you
purchase
when
you
hit
age
59
and
a
half
with
that
money,
it
will
be
an
annuity
that,
i
would
guess...
you
know,
i...
i
hate
to
do
math
in
my
head
like
this.
i'd
guess
it
would
throw
off
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
a
month
in
additional
income.
and
so
if
you
ask
will
the
rouseys
need
that
money
for
their
support,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes
because
their
only
other
support--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--is
social
security
and
a
$2,000
a
month
defined
benefit
plan
that
will
never
go
up
and
against
which
their
social
security
will
be
offset.
so
when
they
start
becoming
eligible,
as
mr.
rousey
is
about
to
be,
for
social
security,
that
defined
benefit
plan
reduces
their
benefits.
so
if
the
rouseys
are
to
have
an
old
age
in
which
they
can
afford
to
live
in
any
kind
of
reasonable
circumstance
at
all,
they
need
this
money.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
was
unable
to
find
one,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i...
no,
we
do
not
have
one,
and
i
don't--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
they've
taken
a
position
here.
i
will
say
that
in
patterson
against
shumate,
they
referred
to
ira's
in
a
footnote
in
their
brief,
i
believe,
as
pension
plans
under
section
408.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well...
well,
that's
correct.
the
united
states
trustee
may
have
wanted
them
to...
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i'm
going
to
retire
early.
[laughter]
the...
the
first
point
is
that
there
are
two
rights
under
ira's:
the
right
after
age
59
and
a
half
or
upon
death
or
disability
or
illness
to
withdraw
the
money
without
any
kind
of
penalty;
and
there's
a
second
little
exercise,
an
entirely
subsidiary
right,
which
is
the
ability
to
withdraw
money
subject
to
a
penalty
earlier.
the
existence
of
that
second
entirely
subsidiary,
almost
never
used
right...
and
the
statistic
on
this
is
in
the
green
brief
at
page
23...
means
that
the
real
essence
of
an
ira
is
it
is
a
plan
on
account
of
age.
the
second
point.
as
this
court
said
last
year--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
at
the
age
of--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
that's
a
right
that's
very
important
because
let
me
give
you
just
a
mathematical
example
of
the
difference.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
the
statute
gives
that
right.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
and
you
do
have
that
right.
you
also
have
another
right.
but
the
existence
of
that
second
right
doesn't
negate
the
first
right.
the
statute
doesn't
here,
for
example,
as
section
522
or
section
365
of
the
bankruptcy
code
does,
use
the
word
solely
to
say
you...
a
plan
is
eligible
only
if
you
have
solely
the
right
to
receive
on
this--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that
might
be
your
first
thought,
but
then--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--oh,
but
i
think
even
if
that
were
your
first
thought,
you
would
then
get
to
the
implication
that
many
of
the
justices
have
been
pressing
today,
which
is
the
implication
of
that
for
all
plans
is
tremendous
because
all
plans
give...
well,
i
shouldn't
say
all
plans,
but
i
should
say
the
vast
majority
of
other
plans,
401(k)
plans,
profit-sharing
plans,
and
the
like,
do
give
you
early
access
to
your
money,
and
that's
valuable
to
you.
that's
why
in
section--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
the
qualification
of
hardship
has
been
interpreted
by
many
employers
to
say,
you
want
to
buy
a
house
and
you
can't
otherwise?
that's
a
hardship.
you
want
to
sent
your
kid
to
school
and
you
can't
otherwise?
you
have
huge,
you
know,
consumer
loans
and
you
could
consolidate
that?
so
it's
not
as
if
ira's
operate
differently
from
everything
else
in
the
system.
that's
why--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
think
that's--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
need
the
money.
i
don't
have
the
money.
that's
a
hardship.
if
you...
if
all
you
have
to
say
is
the
magic
word
hardship,
i
think
that's
why
we
would
say
ira's
are
similar
plans
or
contracts
because
this
court
has
made
it
clear
similar
is
not
the
same
thing
as
identical.
so
if
similar
reasons
allow
you
to
withdraw,
that's
enough.
and
that's
why
in
section--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--as
i
read
the
new
york
city--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
don't
know,
but
the
new
york
city
police
department
plan
appears
to
work
like
that.
you
can
take
the
money
out
if
you
pay
the
10
percent
penalty.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
not
to
my
knowledge.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
we'd
be
happier
with
10
percent
than
nothing,
but
no
judge
has
ever
read
the
statute
that
way.
the
second
point
is
a
point
that
comes
out
of
this
court's
decision
last
year
in
the
till
case
where
the
court
said,
look,
you
want
to
pick
a
manageable
line,
a
line
that's
straightforward
and
familiar.
and
here's
one
that
i'll
give
you
that
comes
directly
from
the
text
of
section
522(d)(10)(e),
which
is
you
should
hold
that
section
522(d)(10)(e)
permits
the
exemption
of
all
plans
or
contracts
that
qualify
under
section
401(a),
section
403(a),
section
403(b),
or
section
408
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
ira's
do.
and
this
may
have
led
to
some
of
the
confusion,
i
think,
between
counsel
in
this
case,
which
is
in
the
andersen
case,
although
ms.
andersen
was
receiving
money
under
section
408,
it
was
not
a
408
individual
retirement
account.
it
was,
instead,
under
section
403(b),
an
individual
retirement
annuity.
so
there
are,
as
far
as
we
know,
no
individual
retirement
accounts,
the
things
you
put
money
into
while
the
money
accumulates
before
you're
ready
to
retire
and
you
transfer
it
into
an
annuity
that
are
customizable.
and
indeed,
for
the
kinds
of
debtors
who
need
the
protections
of
section
522(d)(10)(e)
the
most,
the
unsophisticated
people
who
are
putting
their
money
away
in
an
ira
because
their
pension
plan
either
doesn't
exist
at
all
or
isn't
adequate
for
their
retirement,
the
idea
that
they
would
understand
to
go
in
and
negotiate
at
a
bank
for
a
customizable
ira
strikes
me
as
quite
implausible.
that's
why
we
think
the
most
sensible
reading
of
the
statute
here
is
to
exempt
ira's
when
the
money
in
them
is
necessary
for
the
support
of
the
debtor.
thank
you.
