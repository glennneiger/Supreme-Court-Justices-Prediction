mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm
not
sure
i
completely
held
it
in...
in
my
mind.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
our
basic
position
is--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
have
two
comments
about
that.
that
was
a
position
which
actually
a
footnote
in
our
brief
in
tyler
against
cain
i
think
suggested,
although
that
wasn't
the
issue
before
the
court
in
that
case.
but
since
that
time,
this
has
been
litigated
in
a
number
of
courts
of
appeals
and
district
courts,
and
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
no
court
has
accepted
that.
and
the
reason
they
haven't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
would
be,
but
i
think
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
probably
wasn't
because
the
words,
by
the
supreme
court,
are
not
only
present
in
two
different
places
right
in
this
paragraph
6(3),
also
in
8(2),
also
in
2244
and
in
22...
i
think...
64.
and
it
does
seem
to
be
a
pattern
that
where
the
congress
expected
a
decision
by
this
court
in
the
whole
series
of
statutes,
they
said,
by
the
supreme
court.
and
it's
notably
missing
from
the
phrase
that
says,
made
retroactive
to
cases
on
collateral
review.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it...
that...
it...
what
it
says...
it
says
newly
recognized
by
the
supreme
court
and
made
retroactive.
it
doesn't
say
by
the
supreme
court.
that's
the
rationale
the
courts
have
used.
but
if
i
could
move
to
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
think
the
other...
the
other
problem
that
i
actually
am...
that
i
think
the
court
should
be
worried
about
is
that
this
statute
sets
one...
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
date
on
which
something
is
made
retroactive.
it
says
it
runs
from
the
later
of
four
dates
and
it
then
sets
forth
what
those
dates
are.
and
it
says,
the
date
on
which
the
right
asserted
was
initially
recognized
by
the
supreme
court,
if
certain
conditions
are
satisfied.
now,
that
if
clause
may
well
raise
some...
it
does
raise,
i
think,
some
interpretative
issues.
but
however
you
interpret
the
if
clause,
that
just
tells
you
whether
the
petitioner
can
use
that
date
on
which
the
right
was
initially
recognized
or
not.
if
he
can't
use
it,
if
the
if
clause
is
not
satisfied,
then
he's...
he
only
has
to
show
he's
timely
under
one
of
the
other
three
provisions.
the
normal
one
is
1
year
from
the
date
that
the
conviction
became
final.
and
i
think
our
primary
submission
in
the
case
is
however
you
construe
the
if
clause,
it
can't
possibly
be
read
to...
whatever
interpretative
problems
there
are
there,
it
can't
be
possibly
be
read
to
alter
the
totally
plain
language
that
congress--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
it's
not--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's
not...
it's
not--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
doesn't.
but
even
then,
it's
not...
it
doesn't
run
from
that
date,
and
the...
he's...
and
the...
the
petitioner
has
the...
the
applicant
has
no
date
on...
if
he's
past
his
1
year
from
the
date
the
conviction
became
final,
he
has
no
date
on
which
he
can
rely
to
make
his
application
timely.
and
our
primary
submission--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
this
statute
doesn't...
it's
not
worded
the
way
the...
the...
paragraph
6
as
a
whole
says
you
have
the
later
of
four
dates.
it
names
four
different
things.
but
subparagraph
(3)
doesn't
say,
well,
the
later
of
any
of
these
things.
it...
it
tells
you
if
the
condition
is
satisfied
then
you...
the
question
is...
okay,
the
if
condition
is
satisfied.
i
can
use
paragraph
(3).
what's
my
time
limit?
and
it
says
the
date
on
which...
1
year
from
the
date
on
which
the
right
was
initially
recognized
by
the
supreme
court,
and
that's
the
date
he
has.
if
the...
if...
if
it
turns
out
that
he
can't
use
it
because
the
appropriate
thing
doesn't
happen
till
later,
then
he
just
can't
use
that
date.
he
has
three
other
possible
dates
to
use
under
paragraph--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i...
i
disagree
with
that.
first,
on
second
habeas,
the...
this
court,
i
think
all
three
opinions,
in
tyler
against
cain
recognized
that
there
can
be
cases
where
this
court
recognizes
a
new
right
and
it
is
retroactive
at
the
same
time
where
it's
the
combination
of
some
earlier
decision
that
said
all
rules
of
a
certain
type
are
retroactive
and
then
in
the
second--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
court
said
we
are
recognizing
a
rule
of
that
type.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it...
it
says
actually
made
retroactive,
and
i...
all
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--all
three
of
the
opinions
in
tyler
recognized
that
that
sort
of
thing
can
happen,
and
i
think
that
that
actually
is
by
far
the
most
common
kind
of
case
because
that's
likely
to
be
a
case
where
the
court
has
said,
for
example,
where
teague
doesn't
apply
at
all
where
the
court
has
narrowed
the
scope
substantially
of
a
federal
criminal
statute
such
as
in
the
bailey
case
where...
where
the
question
was
whether
it
has
to
be
active
use
or
mere
possession
of
a
firearm.
and
those
kinds
of
cases
are
very
possibly,
at
least
if
the
court
has
made
it
clear
that
they're
narrowing
the...
the
court
is
narrowing
the
conduct
that
was
thought
to
be
criminal
in
construing
a
criminal
statute,
those
are
the
kinds
of
cases
that
are
likely
to
arise
most
often.
in
those
kinds
of
cases,
that
is
likely
to
be
the
kind
of
the
thing
the
court
was
talking
about
in
tyler
against
cain.
with
respect
to
the
other
class
of
cases,
which
would...
the
only
other
class
of
retroactive
cases
would
be
those
that
come
within
the
second...
what
used
to
be
called
the
second
teague
exception
for
bedrock
principles
that
have
the
primacy
or
centrality
of
gideon
against
wainwright.
now,
the
court
has
suggested...
it
has
said
that
it
may
be
doubted
that
any
such
rules
remain
to...
to
be
discovered.
but
if
there
were,
i
think
a
court
of...
a
case
of
that
level
of
centrality
and
primacy
and
importance,
i
think
that
this
court
and
other
courts
could
take
steps
to
decide
whatever
pending
section
2255
motions
they
have
or
whatever
ones
could
be
filed
by
someone
who
still
has
their
1
year
to
go
from
date
of
finality
of
conviction
to
decide
those
quite
quickly
because
that
would
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
you
know,
i...
for
instance,
i
don't
know
what
the
history
was.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
the...
what
the
court
has
said
and
clarified
most
recently
in
the
summerlin
case
last
year
is
that
those...
teague
doesn't
apply.
it's
not
an
exception
to
teague,
but
teague
doesn't
apply
because
those
cases
are
retroactive
without
going
through
a
particular
analysis
under
teague.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
government
doesn't
have
any
interest
in
doing
that.
and
i...
i
think
if
the
government--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
would...
i
would
recommend
the
government
do
that
if
we
found
a
case.
what
actually
happens,
of
course,
in
real
life
is
there's
argument
about
what
were...
what...
how
was
the
jury
actually
instructed.
did
the
jury
find
the
necessary
fact?
was
it
just
harmless
error
because
this
case
was
tried
on
a
theory
that
made
it
totally
clear
that
he
did
commit
the
crime
even
as
narrowed
by
this
court
and
those
kinds
of
questions
arising.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
can't
say
how
they
would
work
themselves
out.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't...
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
so
because
i
would
only
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
i
don't
think
the
government
holding
somebody
pursuant
to
a
hitherto
valid
judgment
would
be
seen
as
an
impediment
to
making
an...
a
motion.
i
think
that
would
be
the
government--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
but
the...
the
defendant--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
fact
that
the
government
is
holding
him
doesn't
prevent
him
from
file.
if
the
government
did
actually
prevent
him
from
filing
something,
said
you...
we're
not
going
to
take
your
mail
that
you're
trying
to
send
to
the
court,
i
think
that's
the
kind
of
thing--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
the
government
has.
i
think
the
government
has
said,
go
ahead
and
file
whatever
you
want
to
file,
and
if
you
can
obtain
relief,
then
you
should
get
it.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
if
the
government
itself
concludes
that
someone
should
be
released,
there
are
mechanisms
to
do
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
government
could.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
under
that...
those
circumstances,
there
may
be
circumstances
under
which
equitable
tolling
would
be
appropriate
in
a
particular
case.
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
also--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
i
don't...
i
wouldn't
go
here
on
equitable
tolling.
in
other
words,
i
think
maybe...
i
don't...
i
can't
imagine
all
the
possible
cases
under
6(3).
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
where
the
event
that
you're
relying
on
for
tolling
would
be
an
event
that
is
anticipated
in
the
statute
and
would
be
across
the
board
and
would
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
particular
conduct
of
the
petitioner's
case,
but
whether
someone
else
has
gone
and
gotten
a
retroactivity
ruling,
i
think
it
would
be
unprecedented
in
those
circumstances
to
just
rewrite
the
statute
to
come
to
a
different
date
than
what
congress
had
set.
congress
set
the
date
on
which
the
right
initially
was
recognized
by
this
court.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
you
know,
i'd...
i'd
have
to
look
at
the...
i
can
tell
you
where
the
statutes
are.
one
is
8(2),
of
course,
which
is
right
in
2255.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
other
is
in
2244
which
i
think
is
worded
exactly
the
same
as
this
is.
the
third
is
i
think
2264,
which
i...
i
just
would
have
to
look
at
the
specific
wording
of
each
of
those.
but
i
think
the...
you
know,
and
this--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--you
could
also--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--you
could
also...
you...
you
could,
but
you...
and
we
did
take
that
position
in
tyler.
you
could
also
read
it,
though,
the...
the
presence
of
the
word
supreme
court
right
before
and
the
absence
of
the
words,
the
supreme
court,
here
and
the
presence
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
first
one...
you
could
certainly
draw
the
inference
that
this
was
not
something...
this
part
of
it
didn't
have
to
be
made
by
the
supreme
court.
and
perhaps
congress
was
recognizing
that
it...
it
does
take
this
court
a
longer
time
to
reach
a
retroactivity
decision
than
it
would
take
the
lower
courts
hearing
cases.
once--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
there's
any
statement
one
way
or
another,
but
i
do
think
there
are
holdings.
there
are
holdings
as...
as
the
petitioner
relies
on
by
the
eleventh--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
just...
i
think
that
would
be
unlikely
because
this
court's
practice
has
certainly
not
since
teague
and
even
going
decades
before
teague--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
guess
i...
i
would
just
think
it's
unlikely
because
although
this
statute
has
some
drafting...
it
certainly
raises
some
drafting
issues,
i
think
they
likely...
that
basic
element
of
this
court's
retroactivity
jurisprudence,
which
has
been
true
for
decades,
i
think
likely--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--just...
i'm
reading
it
has
an
if.
if
is
a
condition.
if--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--what
if
does
is
states
a
condition.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
because
congress
didn't
say
it.
if
congress
had
phrased
this
the
way
it
phrased
the...
the
6(3)
as
a
whole
and
said
it
shall
it
run
from
the
later
of
three
dates,
the
date
that
the
supreme
court
holds
it...
recognizes
the
right
or
the
date
it
holds
it
retroactive,
that
would
have...
that
would
have
been--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
would
have--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
what
the
clause
does
is
it
makes
it
clear
that
in
6(3),
which
is
a...
you
know,
intended
to
be
a
narrow
exception
from
the...
the
rule
of
finality...
that
in
6(3)
what
congress
was
doing
was
saying
this
is
the
only
class
of
cases
that
we
want
this
to
apply
to.
and
if
they
had
just
said
the
date
on
which
the
right
was
initially
recognized
by
the
supreme
court,
i
think
there
might
have
been
some
inference
that
they
were
not...
they
were
trying
to
extend
that
beyond
cases
that
are
retroactive
under
teague,
or
perhaps
someone
might
have
read
that
and
said,
you
know,
teague
is
no
longer
applicable.
now
congress
has
a
new
standard
that
it's
enacted
here.
and
i
think
congress
wanted
make
clear...
the
people
who
drafted
this...
that
that
was
not
what
they
were
trying
to
do.
and
by
saying
made
retroactive...
if
it
has
been
newly
recognized
and
made
retroactive
to
cases
on
collateral
review,
what
they
were
plainly
referring
to
was
this
court's
jurisprudence
under
teague
so
that
no
one
would
think
this
deadline
is
supposed
to
somehow
open
the
door
to
cases
that
would
otherwise
be
barred
by
teague.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
every
court
that
has
addressed
that
question
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
can
be...
it
has
to
be
the
circuit
with
territorial
jurisdiction
over
the
applicant's
case.
that's
generally
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
of
appeals
and
the
area
in
which
their
rulings
are
effective.
it
also
could
be,
in
our
view,
the
district
court
that's
hearing
the
particular
defendant's
case
because
that's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
i
don't
see
any...
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
the
appropriate
thing
to
do.
i
think
if...
if
the
view
was
that
this
had
to...
it
couldn't
be
filed
until
a
court
with
jurisdiction
over
the
case
had
actually
held
that
the
right
was
retroactive,
then
i
think
the
correct
course
for
the
district
court
would
be
to
dismiss
it
because
it's...
it's
not...
it's
not
a
timely
petition.
at
the
time
when
it's
filed,
there's...
it's...
we're
assuming
1
year
past
the
date
that
the
conviction
became
final,
and
there's
no
other
provision
at
that
point
that
can
render
it
timely.
and
at
that
point,
the
correct
course
for
the
district
court
would
be
just
to
dismiss
it.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
our
view...
well,
that...
that...
if...
if
the...
the
made
retroactive
has
to
occur
before
he
files,
that
would
be
the
consequence.
but
our
view
is
it
can
be
made
retroactive
in
his
own
case,
and
therefore,
anyone
can
file.
they
have
a
1-year
window
from
the
time
when
a
new
right
is
recognized,
and
if
in
their
own
case
it's
held
to
be
retroactive,
then
they
were
timely
and
they
may
well
get
relief
depending--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--so
far
as
first
habeas
goes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i
think
that
it's...
i
don't...
second
habeas
is
definitely
a
narrower
window,
and
i
think
congress
intended
it
to
be
a
narrower
window.
but
for
the
reasons
i
said,
there
are
decisions
where
the
court
holds...
where
this
court
recognizes,
in
effect,
the
retroactivity
of
a
new
rule
at
the
same
time
as
it
announces
it,
as
the
court
said
in
tyler.
and
there
are...
this
court
and
lower
courts
can
act
quickly
on
these
kinds
of
things.
if
the
kind
of
bedrock
principle
with
the
primacy
and
centrality
of
gideon
against
wainwright
came
up,
i
think
the
lower
courts
would
see
we
have
to
act
very
quickly
on
this.
i...
one
point
of
note
is
that
richardson
itself,
which
the
government
doesn't
believe
is
retroactive,
but
that's
not
before
the
court
here...
the
first
decision
holding
richardson
retroactive
came
down
7
months
after
this
court
decided
richardson.
the
second...
and
that
was
where
no
one
was
thinking
they
had
to
particularly
rush
on
that.
but
if
this
court
were
to
recognize
a
new
right
under...
a...
a
new
right
that
satisfied
the
second
teague
exception,
i
think
it
can
be
expected
because
it
would
necessarily
be...
have
a
certain
primacy
and
centrality
and
sweep
that
there
would
probably
be
cases
pending
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
in
the
district
courts
raising
that
issue,
and
i
think
the
courts
involved,
if
they...
this
court
said,
look,
this
is...
this
is
the
way
the
thing
has
to
be
understood
in
accordance
with--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
this
court
has...
has
to
take
cases
and
plan
its
docket
in
accordance
with
a
wide
variety
of
considerations
and
that
may
be
something
that
the
court
would
want
to
take
into
consideration.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
essentially
the
same
one,
that...
that
they
use
the
term
right
in
6
and
they
didn't
intend
that
term
to
mean
something
different,
whether
it
was
a
first
habeas
or
a
second
habeas.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
they
were
talking
about
the
right
that
was
asserted.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
that's
another--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
in
paragraph
8(2)
only...
only...
it
does
require
a
constitutional
right.
but
in...
in
6(3)
it
refers
just
to
right.
but,
as
i
said,
that
would,
i
think,
encompass
the
class
of
cases
such
as
bailey
where
this
court
interprets
a
federal
statute
and
narrows
it
and
makes
conduct
that
was
thought
to
violate
the
statute
earlier...
it
means
that
conduct
no
longer
violates
it.
those
kinds
of
decisions
may
well
under...
if
the
court
has
made
those
points
clear,
if
that
clearly
is
what
this
court
decided,
those
cases
may
well
be
retroactive
at
the
time
they're
announced
under
the
rationale
that
all
the
opinions
in
tyler
against
cain
accepted.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
there's
sound...
those
seem
to
me
to
be
synonymous
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct.
i
think
initially
recognizing
may
well
be
another
way
of
saying
the
same
thing.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
was
actually
thinking
of
it
the
other
way
around.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
which...
but
that...
that...
where
this
court
has--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't.
no,
i
don't.
but
i
think
the
point
of
the
newly...
in
fact,
if
you
look
at...
if
you
kind
of
flip
it,
the
point
of
this
provision
can...
maybe
becomes
a
little
bit
clearer.
it's
if...
if
you
start
with
the
if,
if
the
petition
is
based
on
a
right
that
is
newly
recognized
and
made
retroactive
to
cases
on
collateral
review,
that's
the
class.
if
that
happened--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--then
the
time
runs
from
the
date
on
which
it
was
initially
recognized.
in
other
words--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that...
that
would
have
been
better.
i
would
definitely
agree
with
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
i
just
have
a
couple
of
answers
to
that.
one
is
that
when
congress
enacts
a
statute
of
limitations,
any
statute
of
limitations
has
the
effect
of
pushing
people
into
court
who
might
otherwise
like
to
wait.
and
that
was
a
predictable
result
that
congress
would
have
surely
known
when
it
enacted
this.
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but...
and
which...
many
of
which
may
be
quite
easy
to...
to
dismiss.
but
i
would
say
ms.
bergmann's
reading
has
a
kind
of...
the
opposite
problem
with
it,
which
is
under
her
reading
the...
no
one...
when
a
court
holds
something
retroactive
can...
is
an
unpredictable
matter.
and
under
her
reading,
nobody...
even
where
there's
a
right
that's
rather
important
and
that
should
be
retroactive,
no
one
could
get
relief
until
an
appropriate
court
has
held
it
retroactive,
which
could
take
years.
it
could
be
never.
and
if
the
court...
and
i
think
that
that
reading
of
that...
therefore,
i
think
that
that...
that
reading
has
just
the
opposite
problem.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
what
congress
wanted--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
can
do
that
subject
to
appeal
and
ultimately
certiorari
in
this
court.
i
think,
though,
that
ultimately
what
congress
wanted
was
a
1-year
period
after
this
court
initially
recognizes
a
new
right.
when
the...
for
that...
that
period
of
time
the
finality
that
is
so
important
to
the
criminal
law
is...
does...
is
suspended
to
a
certain
degree.
people
can
litigate
the
issue.
after
that,
the
criminal
law
can
go
back
to
its
retributive,
deterrent
purposes
which
can
only
be
achieved
if
finality
is
recognized.
i
think,
in
particular,
when
you're
talking
about
section
2255
motions,
frequently
the
relief,
if
there
is
any,
is
going
to
be
a
new
trial.
and
there's
a
particular
cost,
as
the
court
has
recognized,
of
trying
to
retry
somebody
many,
many
years
after
an
initial
conviction.
sometimes
it
means,
in
effect,
it's
just
an
acquittal
because
you
can't
find
the
witnesses
or
you
can
no
longer
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
i
think,
therefore,
congress
said,
if
there's
a
new
right,
that's
a
sufficiently
exceptional
circumstance,
that
we
can
suspend
that
finality
for
a
brief
period,
but
1
year
and
that's
all.
these
things
shouldn't
come
out
10
years
later
or
15
years
later
or
20
years
later.
and
that
was
the
purpose,
i
think
a
perfectly
reasonable
purpose
the
congress
intended
to
serve
here.
and
i
think
that
actually
the
language
of
it,
which
says
1
year
from
the
date
on
which
the
right
asserted
was
initially
recognized
by
this
court,
accomplishes
that
purpose.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
the
date...
there's
only
one
possible
date
that
can
be
found
in
this
language.
unless
the
court
felt
that
it
had
to
completely
rewrite
it,
there's
only
one
date,
the
date
on
which
the
right
asserted
was
initially
recognized
by
this
court.
and
even
if...
whatever
problems
the
if
clause
have...
has,
that
may
mean
that
this...
not
very
many
people...
the
worst
it
would
mean
is
that
not
many
people
can
take
advantage
of
that
date.
but
unless
it's...
that
date
is...
there's
something
unconstitutional,
which
no
one
has
suggested,
about
congress
picking
that
date
and
that
limitations
period
for
people
who
have
had
the
chance
to
litigate
things
on
direct
review...
in
any
event,
it
had
1
year
from
the
date
their
conviction
became
final.
unless
there's
something
wrong
with
that,
i
think
that
the
court
should
follow
the
terms
of
the
statute,
and
the
time
should
run
1
year
from
the
date
on
which
the
right
was
initially
recognized.
