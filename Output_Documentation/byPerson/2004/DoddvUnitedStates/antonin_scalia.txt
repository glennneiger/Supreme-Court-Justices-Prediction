scalia
of
course,
if...
if
you

could
trigger
the

the
whole
country.

antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
proximity
of
the
reference
to
the
supreme
court
there
really--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
you
read
it
the
first
time,
you
think
they're
talking
about
the
supreme
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
been
newly
recognized
by
the
supreme
court
and
made
retroactively
applicable.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
feldman,
is
there
any
case
in
which
the
supreme
court
newly
recognizes
a
right
in
which
it
does
not
initially
recognize
the
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they're...
they're...
i
thought
your
position
was
newly
recognized
means
that
it...
it
has
to
be
the
kind
of
a
right
that
would...
would
overcome
our
usual
bar
to...
to,
you
know,
rights
that
existed
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
every...
every
newly
recognized
is
an...
is
an
initially
recognized,
although
every
initially
recognized
is
not
necessarily
a
newly
recognized.

that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
way
around?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
who
wrote
this
either,
do
you?

justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
have
been
the
date
on
which
it
was
newly
recognized.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
couldn't
they
say,
the
date
on
which
the
right
asserted
was
newly
recognized
by
the
supreme
court
if
it
has
been
made
retroactively
applicable?
wouldn't
that
have
been
a
more--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
didn't
newly...
it
didn't
newly
recognize
it
either,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was...
it
recognized
that
when
it
would
be
initially
recognized,
it
would
be
newly
initially
recognized.

justice
antonin
scalia

see
your
point.
