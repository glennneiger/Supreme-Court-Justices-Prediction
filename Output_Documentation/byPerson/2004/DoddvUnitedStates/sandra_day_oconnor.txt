justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we've
had
very
few
instances
in
recent
years
i
think
where
this
court
has
found
some
right
to
be
retroactive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
just
doesn't
happen
very
often
to
begin
with.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
would
be
further
limited
if
the
government's
position
is
adopted
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
doesn't
happen
anyway--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--very
often.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how...
how
do
we
read
this
statute
concerning
what
court
may
find
the
retroactivity?
it's
not
limited,
i
assume,
under
either
your
view
or
the
government's
to
a
finding
by
this
court,
a
determination
that
it's
retroactive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
could
be
a
court
in
another
circuit
presumably
if
you're
in
the
federal
system.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
a
litigant
can
read
decisions
from
other
courts,
as
a
lawyer
can.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there's...
there's
just
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
what
level
court
it
has
to
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
would...
it
would
potentially
violate
the
1-year
limit.
that
won't
necessarily
work.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it's
a
very
odd
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
disagree
and
think
it
should
be,
i
guess
that
would
open
a
door
down
the
road
for
people
after
this
court
made
such
a
determination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
address
that
last
suggestion
first,
mr.
feldman?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
to...
to
interpret
as
meaning
only
this
court
could
make
the
retroactivity
determination
and
the
1
year
wouldn't
run
until
and
unless
there
was
a
new
rule
and
subsequently
in
whatever
case
this
court
said
it
was
retroactive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
true,
but
i
assume
it
is,
nonetheless,
open
for
us
to
do
so--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
we
thought
it
was
correct.
what
is
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
it
is
another
case
about
a
statute
of
limitations.
the
petitioner,
michael
donald
dodd
was
convicted
in
federal
court
of
knowingly
and
intentionally
engaging
in
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
in
violation
of
21
u.s.
code
sections
841
and
846
along
with
several
other
crimes.
his
conviction
became
final
on
august
6th,
1997.
more
than
three
years
later,
in
april
2001,
dodd
filed
a
pro
se
motion
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
under
28
u.s.
code
2255.
he
sought
to
set
aside
his
conviction
based
on
an
intervening
decision
of
this
court
in
a
case
called
richardson
versus
united
states.
dodd
tried
to
take
advantage
of
the
one
year
statute
of
limitations
in
a
subsection
of
section
2255
which
provides
that
the
one
year
limitation
period
begins
to
run
on
the
date
on
which
the
right
asserted
was
initially
recognized
by
the
supreme
court,
if
that
right
has
been
newly
recognized
by
the
supreme
court
and
made
retroactively
applicable
to
cases
on
collateral
review.
dodd
argued
that
that
limitation
period
did
not
begin
to
run
until
april
2002
when
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
the
right
recognized
in
richardson
applied
retroactively
to
cases
on
collateral
review.
the
federal
district
court
dismissed
dodd's
motion
for
habeas
as
time
barred
because
the
richardson
case
had
been
decided
more
than
one
year
before
dodd
filed
his
motion.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
the
eleventh
circuit's
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
text
of
paragraph
6.3
unequivocally
identifies
one
and
only
one
date
from
which
the
one
year
limitation
period
is
measured.
the
statute
says
the
date
on
which
the
right
asserted
was
initially
recognized
by
the
supreme
court.
the
second
clause
of
the
paragraph
has
no
impact
on
the
date
identified
in
the
first
clause.
it
limits
the
paragraphs
application
to
cases
in
which
applicants
are
seeking
to
assert
rights
newly
recognized
by
the
supreme
court
made
retroactively
applicable
to
cases
on
collateral
review.
that
means
that
if
this
court
decides
a
case
recognizing
a
new
right,
a
federal
prisoner
seeking
to
assert
that
right
will
have
one
year
from
the
date
of
this
court's
decision
for
judgment
within
which
to
file
his
section
2255
motion.
he
may
take
advantage
of
the
date
in
the
first
clause
of
paragraph
6.3
only
if
the
conditions
in
the
second
clause
are
met.
now,
in
this
case,
dodd's
motion
sought
to
benefit
from
our
holding
in
richardson
which
was
decided
june
1,
1999
so
he
had
one
year
from
that
date
within
which
to
file
his
motion.
because
he
did
not
file
it
until
april,
2001,
the
motion
was
untimely.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer
join
in
part;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
just
justice
breyer
has
joined.
