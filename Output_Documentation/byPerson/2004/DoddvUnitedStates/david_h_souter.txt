justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
shouldn't
the
litigant
be
put
on
notice
by
a
district
court
decision?
let's
assume
it's
in
his
own
circuit.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--of
course,
if
we're...
if...
if
admittedly,
as
justice
breyer
said,
we're
trying
to
figure
out
some
way
to
make
this
work
in
circumstances
in
which
it's...
it's
never
going
to
work
smoothly,
i
suppose
one
answer
would
be
to
take
the
government's
position
and
say
you've...
your...
your
year
runs
from
the
moment
the
right
is
recognized,
but
to
the...
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
retroactivity
question,
a...
a
court
should
simply
stay
the
proceeding,
hold
it
in
abeyance
to
see
whether,
particularly
in...
in
second
habeas
where
you
have
the...
the
second
petition
where
you
have
the
problem,
to
see
whether
some
court
will,
in
fact,
recognize
retroactivity
or
whether
the...
your
circuit
will
recognize
retroactivity.
then
if
it
does,
then
you
can
go
forward.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
there's
no
question
there's
a
rube
goldberg
character
of
the
whole
thing,
i...
i
realize.
but...
but
that
would
be
a
way
of...
of
solving
the
second
habeas
problem
and
still
accepting
the
government's
position
on
the...
on
the
date
at
which
the...
the
1
year
for
filing
starts.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
on
justice
stevens'
analysis,
he
does
not
have
a
date
until
the
retroactivity
decision
is
made,
and
he
has
to
sit
there
and
wait.
but
when
the
retroactivity
decision
is
made,
he's
got
his
date.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
follow
your
linguistic...
justice
stevens
follows
the
linguistic
analysis.
i
think
the
question
that
he's
raising,
the
question
i'm
raising
is,
do
we
have
a
good
reason
here
to
doubt
that
the
linguistic
analysis
is
getting
us
to...
to
what
congress
would
have
intended?
the
proposed
good
reason
or
the
best
reason
i
think
is
that
if
we
read
it
your
way,
then
as
justice
breyer
said
in
tyler,
as
a
practical
matter,
second
habeas
is...
is...
a
second
habeas
petitioner
is...
is
almost
never
going
to...
or
probably,
in
fact,
never
will
get
the
benefit
of
the
new
rule.
well,
maybe
one
answer
to
that
is,
so
what.
the
reason
that
cannot
be
dismissed,
i
think,
that
way
is
this.
as
has
been
pointed
out
here,
we
do
not
under
our
rules
often
make
a
new
rule
retroactive,
but
when
we
do
under
the
conditions
which
we
impose
for
that,
it's...
it's
one
humdinger
of
a
rule.
[laughter]
and
it
is...
it
is
unlikely...
or
at
least
there's
a
good
argument
that
it's
unlikely...
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
exclude
all
the
potential
second
habeas
people
from
it,
particularly
because
they're
second
habeas
people
because
they
got
in
in
time
on
first
habeas.
they
played
by
the
rules,
and
on
your
theory
basically
they're
out
of
the
game
on
a
very
important
rule.
so
that's
the
argument
for
saying
that
your
linguistic
analysis
may
not
be
pointing
to
what
congress
intended.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
is
a
highly
exceptional
case,
and
the
problem
with
that
is...
i
mean,
if...
if
we're
going
to...
if
you're
going
to
be
linguistic
about
it,
you'd
have
to
say,
well,
that
really
is
not
very
sound
reasoning
because
that
is
not
a
holding
because
the...
you...
you've
got
not
merely
to
have
recognized
it
under
the
statute,
but
you've
got
to
have
held
it.
and
that's...
that's
pretty
unlikely.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
guess
we've
said
you've
got
to
do
it
with--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
far
as
first
habe
goes.
justice
david
h.
souter
second
habe,
he's
out
cold.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
laughing
at
the
statute,
not
at
you.
