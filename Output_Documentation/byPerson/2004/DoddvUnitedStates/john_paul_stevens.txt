justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
the
words,
made
retroactively
applicable
to
cases
on
collateral
review,
don't
have
a
modifier
such
as
telling
us
by
whom
it's
made
retroactive.
has
any
court
considered
what
seems
to
me
a
fairly
normal
reading
that
the...
the
words,
by
the
supreme
court,
should
apply
to
that
phrase
as
well
as
the
preceding
language?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
cuts
in
the
other
direction,
that
when
congress
thought
about
the
entity
that
makes
it
retroactive,
they
thought
about
us.
and
that's
why...
and
that's
the
only
language
that
seems
to
fit.
i
mean,
the
by
the
supreme
court
seems
to
fit
that
concept.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
guess
nobody
has
come
up
with
this
suggestion
other
than
this
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
fits
the
language,
the
date
on
which
the
right
was
initially
recognized
by
the
supreme
court
if
and
only
if
it's
been
made
retroactively
by
the
supreme
court.
it
seems
to
me
a
very
normal
reading
of
the
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
noticeably
missing
because
it...
it
has
a
blank
there
and
the
words,
by
the
supreme
court,
are
the
only
time
limitation
in
that
whole
provision
after
the
word
if.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
it
could
because
you
could
say
what
the
congress
intended
to
say.
if
the
right
had
x,
y,
and
z,
it
shall
in
that
event
run
from
that
date.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
implicit
in
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
like
the
words,
by
the
supreme
court--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
be
implicit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
any
of
these
statutes
or
legislative
history
or
any...
anyplace
else
where
congress
ever
thought
of
the
possibility
that
some
other
court
might
make
a
new
rule
retroactive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
the
other
reading
is...
the
assumption
was...
and
i
think
it's
incorrect...
that
we
would
simultaneously
identify
the
new
right
and
decide
it
is
or
is
not
retroactive.
that
was
the
assumption
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i
realize
it's
wrong,
but
i
think
that's
probably
the
assumption
congress
made.
that's
what
i'm
suggesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
the
only
thing
about
your
reading
of
the
statute
that
troubles
me
is
you're...
you're
reading
the
word
only.
if
it's
a
1-year
statute,
but
only
if
congress...
the
supreme
court
has
already
done
the
next
two
things.
1
year
is
the
maximum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
an
only--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
not
an
if,
but
if
that
happens,
then
it
shall
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--see,
it
really--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
accomplish
your
objective
if
you
just
struck
the
whole
clause
after
the
word
if.
you
don't
really
need
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
this
question?
isn't
it
true
that
under
some
of
the
other
references
they
refer
to
a
constitutional
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
this
just
refers
to
a
right
and
it
includes
statutory
rights.
and,
of
course,
the
odd
thing
about
that
is
that
normally
when
we
construe
a
statute,
we
say
it
always
meant
that.
it's
not...
it's
not
a
new
right
in
the
sense
as
a
right
as
of
the
date
of
enactment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
difference
between
the
constitution
and
statutes
sometimes
is
rather
significant.
