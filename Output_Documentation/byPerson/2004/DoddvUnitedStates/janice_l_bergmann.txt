ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
good
morning.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
today
is
presented
with
two
strikingly
different
interpretations
of
when
the
1-year
period
of
limitation
found
in
paragraph
6(3)
of
28
u.s.c.,
section
2255
begins
to
run.
if
paragraph
6(3)
is
read
in
a
manner
that
is
consistent
with
both
congress'
use
of
verb
tense
and
this
court's
decision
in
tyler
v.
cain,
then
the
government's
interpretation
of
when
the
1-year
period
begins
to
run
is
absurd
because
it
reduces
paragraph
6(3)
to
a
near
nullity.
this
is
so
because,
as
even
the
government
admits,
retroactivity
decisions
almost
always
come
more
than
a
year
after
a
decision
of
this
court
initially
recognizing
a
right.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
very
few
cases
would...
would
have
a
retroactivity
decision
within
a
year
of
initial
recognition.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
the...
it
would...
the
argument
is
in
my
favor,
your
honor,
because
this
court
should
not
read
acts
of
congress
in
a
manner
that
would
render
them
absurd.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
well,
in...
in
this
case,
your
honor,
it
does
in
two
ways.
it
does
because
the
relief
that
it
would
allow
has
only
occurred,
in
my
estimation,
once
in
the
post-teague
world
since
1989
when
teague
v.
lane
was
decided,
and
the
only
other
instance
would
be
when
this
court
would
find
a
right
is
both...
initially
recognize
a
right
and
find
that
right
retroactive
in
the
same
case,
which
in
my
opinion
had--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
would
basically
be--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--it...
it
does
not--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--it
does
not
happen
very
often,
your
honor,
but
there
have
been
several
instances.
the
situation
in
bousley
where
the
court
found
that
the
rights
in
bailey
applied
retroactively.
i
think
most
people
would
consider
the
court's
recent
decision
in
atkins
v.
virginia
would
apply
retroactively
in
light
of
this
court's
earlier
decision
in
penry
v.
lynaugh.
so
it
does,
indeed,
happen
and
because
it
happens
and
because
the
rights
involved
in
those
types
cases
are
so
important--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
parties
agree
that
a
lower
court
can
make
the
retroactivity
decision
as
well,
and
that's
because
of--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
argue
that
it
would
have
to
be
a
court
in
the...
in
the
circuit
in
which
the
prisoner
would
be
filing
the
2255
motion
because
that--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--because
that
court
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
proceedings
in
his
case
and
it
would
be
an
adequate
way
of
providing
notice
to
that
litigant.
it...
a
decision
of
another--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
they
would
have
no
precedential
effect
in
his
case.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
well,
your
honor,
a
district
court
decision
would
have
no
precedential
value
with
respect
to...
would
not
bind
other
district
courts
in
that
district
and
therefore
not
bind
other
litigants.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
well,
actually,
your
honor,
the
statute
does
say
that
the
ruling
would
have
to
be
made
retroactively
applicable
to
cases
on
collateral
review.
it
does
not
say
a
case.
and
a
decision
of
a
district
court
would
make
that
retroactivity
applicable
only
to
one
case
not
to
cases.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
well,
it
could
be,
your
honor,
but
i...
congress
included
the
language.
i
think
this
court
could
give
meaning
to
it
by
interpreting
the
statute
to
mean
that
you
would
be
looking
at
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
a
decision
from
a
district
court.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
it
would
be
very
complicated,
your
honor,
given
the
fact
that
district
courts
often
issue
rulings
in
unpublished
decisions
as
well.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
if
there
were
only
first
habeas,
your
honor,
and
if
the
lower
courts
always
made
the
correct
retroactivity--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--that's--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--well,
your
honor,
there
is
also
a
problem
which
the
government
actually
concedes--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--which
is
if
you
read
the
statutory
language,
the
second
clause
as
being
stated
in
the
past
tense,
and
the
initial...
and
the
statute
of
limitations
that
begins
to
run
with
initial
recognition,
it...
it
doesn't
respect
congress'
intent
to
provide
a
1-year
limitation
period.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
with
respect
to
first
habeases.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
well,
your
honor--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--the...
the
same
would
be
true
though,
your
honor,
then
for
initial
motions
that
there
would
be
no
right
available
unless
a
court
at
some
point
had
held
the
right
applied
retroactively
to
collateral
cases
because
under
teague
v.
lane,
there
is
no
right
to
collateral
relief
simply
based
on
the
decision
of
this
court
unless
that
decision
has
also
been
held
retroactively
applicable.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
yes,
i
understand
that.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
well,
your
honor,
i
agree
with...
that...
that
this
is
not
the
best
drafted
statute
that
congress
has
ever
come
up
with,
but
i
think
that
respecting
congress'
use
of
verb
tense
and
this
court's
decision
in
tyler
v.
cain,
to
read
paragraph
8(2)
and
paragraph
6(3)
together,
that...
that
it's
important
that
all
three
of
the
prerequisites
in
the
statute
have
been
met
before
the
limitation
period
begins
to
run.
otherwise--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
was
early
under
our
interpretation--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--that's--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
at
the
time
he
filed,
there
had
not
been
a
retroactivity
decision
on
which
he
could
rely.
during
the
course
of
litigation
in
the
district
court,
the
eleventh
circuit
decided
the
ross
case,
and
at
that
point,
his
right
to
relief
became
ripe
and
the...
and
he
then
had
a
window
open
under
paragraph
6(3),
such
as
he
could
file
timely.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
well,
the
problem
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that
it...
it
encourages,
as
the
government's
rule
in
general
does...
encourages
numerous
frivolous
filings.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
well,
a
procedure
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
adopted...
and
the
seventh
circuit
agrees
with...
with
mr.
dodd's
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
it
begins
to
run
with
the
retroactivity
decision.
their
solution
for
these
premature
filings
is
to
review
the
case
on
the
merits,
and
if
they
feel
that
the
motion
would
lose
on
the
merits,
they
dismiss
it
with
prejudice,
and
if
they
feel
there's
some
viable
claim
being
stated,
then
they
dismiss
it
without
prejudice
to
refiling
at
a
later
time.
that's--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--well--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
it's
very
odd.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
actually
my
understanding
is
that
much
of
it
was
written
by
the
attorney
general
in
california
at
the
time.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
yes,
your
honor.
my
understanding
of
when
a
right
is
newly
recognized
is...
is
when
it
is
new
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
adopted
under
teague
v.
lane,
that
it's
not
dictated
by
prior
precedent.
a
right
can
be
initially
recognized
by
this
court
but
not
new
in
the
teague
sense.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
but
then,
your
honor,
you
run
up
against
your
decision
in
tyler
v.
cain,
and
that
was
the
circumstance
of
the
litigant
in
tyler
v.
cain.
no...
this
court
had
not
previously
determined
that
the
right
at
issue
in
tyler
v.
cain
was
retroactively
applicable,
and
under
the
second
or
successive
statute
that...
and
the
way
the
court
read
this,
the
court
said
that
this
court
could
not
determine
the
retroactivity
of,
i
believe
it
was,
cage
v.
louisiana
in
that
very
case
because
it
was
contrary
to
the
language
in
the
statute.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
congress
appears
to
have
intended
in
this...
in
this
statute,
as...
as
much
as
anyone
can
tell,
is
that
retroactivity
decisions
be...
be
litigated
in
the
cases
that
are
brought
under
paragraph
6(1)
which
is
those
cases
that
are
within
a...
a
year
of
when
the
judgment
of
conviction
became
final.
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
and
the
ross
case
that
litigated
the
question
of
the
retroactivity
of
richardson,
that
was
a
case
brought
under
paragraph
6(1).
mr.
ross
was
within
a
year
of
when
his
judgment
of
conviction
became
final,
and...
and
the
issue
of
retroactivity
was...
was
litigated
straight
and
up
in
that
case.
and
what
it
appears
that
congress
intended
was
that
very
circumstance
to
happen
in
all
cases,
that
the
retroactivity
of
decisions
of
this
court
be
litigated
in
cases
brought
within
a
year
of
finality,
and
then
once
those
decisions
were
made,
then
litigants
under
paragraph
6(3)
would
have
the
opportunity
to
file
when
a
court
of
appeals
issued
a
retroactivity
ruling.
and
then
litigants
under
paragraph
8(2)
would
have
a...
the
ability
to
file--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--well,
then,
your
honor,
i
guess
the
court
would
have
to...
to
totally
reconsider
its
decision
in
tyler
v.
cain
to
reach
that
conclusion.
and
i
don't
know
what
to
say.
i
mean,
since
tyler
v.
cain
was
enacted
for...
i'm
sorry...
decided
4
years
ago,
congress
has
made
no
effort
to
overturn
that
decision,
and
it
appears
congress
believed
that
the
court
had...
had
read
the
statute
correctly
in
that
case.
and
so
if
you
interpret
the
made
retroactivity...
made
retroactively
applicable
language
in
paragraph
6(3)
in
the
way
that
this
court
read
the
language
in
paragraph
8(2),
such
that
the
retroactivity
decision
has
to
be
made
before
a
motion
can
be
filed,
it
becomes
very
complicated
to
do
that
if
the
1-year
period
begins
to
run
within
initial--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--well,
your
honor,
i...
i
agree
that
this
involves
a
very
small
class
of
cases.
the
problem
with
the
government's
reading
is
that
they
say
that
they
are
narrowly
constricting
the
statute,
but
the
procedural
mechanism
that
they
set
up
allows
for
a
vast
number
of
cases
that
would
never
fall
within
the
statute
of
limitations
to
be
filed
and
requires
the
court
to
deal
with
each
and
every
one
of
those
cases
in
the
first
instance.
whereas,
my
reading
of
statute
has
the
benefit
of
allowing
a...
a
test
case
to
proceed.
given
the
fact
that
there
are
very
few
number
of
these
rights
that
are
made
retroactively
applicable,
it...
it
makes
more
sense
in
terms
of
judicial
resources
to
allow
there
to
be
this
situation
where
is...
there
is
a
test
case--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--well,
certainly
the
district
courts
would
do
that.
the
more
appropriate
course
of
action
would
probably
be
to
find
the
motion
at
that
point
untimely
because
it
does
not
fall
within
any
of
the...
it...
if
it
is
outside
the
initial
year
from
finality
but
doesn't
fall
within
any
of
the
other
exceptions
stated
in
paragraph
6,
then
it...
it
would
be
untimely
and
the
court
could
dismiss
it
as
such.
i
mean,
by
doing
so,
if
the
court
dismisses
it,
it
could
well
count
as
a
first
motion
so
that
any
motion
filed
thereafter
would
be
a
second
or
successive
motion.
and
this
would
be...
preclude
litigants
from
filing
prematurely
and
burdening
the
courts
with
premature
filings
until
it
is
clear
they
have
a
cause
of
action.
i
mean,
what's
strange
about
the
government's
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
they
believe
congress
intended
for
a
limitations
period
to
begin
to
run
before
the
litigant
had
any
right
to
relief.
no
one
has
a
right
to
relief
in
the
collateral
proceeding
until
the
right
at
issue
has
been
made
retroactively
applicable
to
collateral
cases.
and
so
that
this
kind
of
disjoinder
of
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
cause
of
action
creates
this
problem
where
people
will
be...
feel
compelled
to
file
protective
motions.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
well,
actually,
your
honor,
every
lower
court
to
consider
the
language
has
found
that
the
retroactivity
decision
need
not
be
made
by
this
court,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
difference
between
the
language
in
paragraph
6(3)
and
in
the
second
or
successive
provision
in
paragraph
8(2).
in
paragraph
8(2),
it
explicitly
states
that
it
has
to
be
made
retroactive
to
cases
on
collateral
review
by
the
supreme
court.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
if...
if
you
apply--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--well,
various
lower
courts
have
considered
that
possibility
and
have
latched
onto
the
different...
differences
in
language
where
paragraph
8(2)
explicitly
states
it
has
to
be
made
by
the
supreme
court,
but
paragraph
6(3)
says
it
does
not.
and...
and
the
court
below
said
the
same
thing,
and
the
parties
agree
that
the
retroactivity
decision
need
not
be
made--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
would
make
paragraph
6(3)
much
more
consistent
with
paragraph
8(2),
if...
if
the--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--but
again,
it
would
work
only
if
the
1-year
period
began
to
run
from
this
court's
retroactivity
decision.
if
it
begins
to
run
from
initial
recognition,
then
that
would
turn
paragraph
6(3)
into
an
absolute
nullity
because
i
know
of
no
case
where
this
court
has
made
a
retroactivity
decision
within
a
year
of
when
it
initially
recognizes
a
right.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
yes,
your
honor,
that
no
one
lese
has...
has
agreed
with
thus
far.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
that's
correct.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
i...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
think
you
may
have
lost
me.
you
would
have
the--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--if
the
court
has
no
other
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
just
several
quick
points.
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
last
point
that
mr.
feldman
made
saying
that
there
is
only
possible
date
under
which
the
limitation
period
can
run
and...
and
cautioning
the
court
about
rewriting
that
date.
what
the
government
neglects
to
mention
is
that
it's
asking
this
court
to
rewrite
the
if
clause
by
changing
congress'
use
of
verb
tense
from
a
past
tense
to...
to
something
that
could
happen
in
the
future.
they
want
this
court
to
read
that
language
contrary
to
tyler,
contrary
to
the
use
of
verb
tense
and
allow
a
district
court
to
make
a
retroactivity
decision
at
some
time
in
the
future
in
every
case
in
which
a
motion
is
filed
under
paragraph
6(3).
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
the...
in
situations
such
as
this
that
involve
these
kinds
of
important
rights,
interests
in
finality
are
at
an
ebb.
these
are
the
types
of
rights
where
someone
may
well
be
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
they
are
incarcerated,
that
involve
important
rights
that
go
to
the
accuracy
of
the
underlying
adjudication.
it
seems
to
me
in
these
circumstances,
there
is...
it
is
a
situation
where
congress'
need
or...
or
the
need
of
the
courts
to
enforce
finality
to
keep
people
in
jail
are
at
their
lowest
point.
these
are
very
special
rights
and
congress
went
to
the
trouble
of
drafting
and
enacting
paragraph
6(3)
and
paragraph
8(2)
to
protect
these
rights.
and...
and
i
think
the
court
should
read
them
as
broadly
as
possible
in
order
to
protect
those
rights.
justice
scalia
asked
a
question
about
the
difference
between
newly
recognized
and
initially
recognized.
i
wanted
to
go
back
to
that
for
a
minute.
there
are
circumstances
where
a...
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
this
right...
where
a...
a
right
may
be
newly
recognized
but
not
yet
initially
recognized.
and
i
would...
i
would
point
the
court's
attention...
the
decision
in
penry.
in
penry
v.
lynaugh,
this
court
stated
that
if
there
was
an
eighth
amendment
bar
to
the
execution
of
mentally
retarded
individuals,
that
would
be
a
new
right
that
would
be
retroactively
applicable
to
collateral
cases.
but
then
the
court
declined
to
initially
recognize
the
eighth
amendment
right.
it
wasn't
until
atkins
was
decided
that
the
eighth
amendment
right
was
initially
recognized.
and
so--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--well,
it...
it...
i
would
say
that
it...
it
recognized
that
it
was
new
and
that
seems
to
be
the
way
the
courts
have
interpreted--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
no
additional
decision
of
this
court
that
would
be
necessary
for...
for
someone
to
conclude
that
all
three
provisions
of
paragraph
6(3)
had
been
met.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
well,
yes,
your
honor.
there...
there
are...
every
time
this
court
issues
a
decision,
someone
could
argue
that
it
initially
recognizes
a
right,
and
whether
that
right
is
new
in
the
teague
sense
or
old--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--no.
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
mean,
there
are
circumstances
where
this
court
initially
recognizes
rights,
but
then
later
on
determines
that
they
are
not
new,
that
they
are
indeed
old.
that
happened
in
simmons
v.
south
carolina.
the
court
recognizes...
recognized
a
right
to
present
certain
types
of
mitigation
evidence
in
the
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
case,
but
then
the
court
later
determined
that
that
was
not
a
new
right.
it
was
an
old
right
in
the
teague
sense,
and
so
it,
therefore,
applied
retroactively
because
it
was
an
old
right
but
it
did
not
newly
recognize
it
at
the
time
that
it
initially
recognized
it.
and
i'm
sorry
for
the
linguistic...
but
it...
it
is
complicated.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
just
wanted
to
say
in
closing
that...
that
it
is
a
difficult
statute,
but
i
think
that
mr.
dodd's
interpretation
of
the
statute
both
respects
congress'
use
of
tense
and
is
consistent
with
the
reading
of
paragraph
8(2)
that
this
court
gave
in
tyler.
it
also
respects
congress'
intention
to
create
a
specific
exception
for
new
rights
that
apply
retroactively
by
allowing
for
the
realistic
possibility
of...
of
success
in
either
an
initial
or
a
second
or
successive
motion
premised
on
such
rights.
it
also,
as
we've
discussed,
promotes
judicial
efficiency
by
eliminating
from
it
frivolous
motions
because
litigants
would
not
file
until
it
was
clear
that
they
actually
had
a
right
to
collateral
relief.
in
sum,
this
court
should
conclude
that
the
triggering
date
is
when
all
three
of
the
prerequisites
have
been
met.
in
this
case,
that
would
be
when
the
eleventh
circuit
decided
ross
v.
richardson.
i
guess
my...
my
final
concern
is
for
my
client.
if
the
court
constructs
a
rule
where
the
supreme
court
would
have
to
be
the
court
that
makes
the
retroactivity
decision,
i
hope
the
court
will
consider
the
effect
of
such
a
rule
on
someone
like
my
client
who
filed
prematurely
on...
in...
in
hopes
that
at
some
point
his
arguably
meritorious
richardson
claim
would
be
heard.
whether
the
court
decides
that
those
premature
filings
should
be
dismissed
without
prejudice
or
if
there's
some
kind
of
analysis
the
lower
courts
should
take
in
resolving
those
claims--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--well--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--well,
that
would
be
my
argument,
your
honor,
that
he
was
premature.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
that's...
that's
if
the
court
would
allow
the
retroactivity
decision
to
be
made
in
the...
on
an
initial
motion
by
the
district
court
in
that
particular
case.
am
i
correct?
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding
you,
your
honor.
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
well,
the
problem
is
that
some
lower
courts
have
held
that
if
you...
you
file
a
motion
that's
untimely--
ms.
janice
l.
bergmann
--thank
you,
your
honor.
