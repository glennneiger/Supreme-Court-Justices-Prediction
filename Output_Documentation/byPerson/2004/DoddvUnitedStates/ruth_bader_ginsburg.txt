justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why...
why
is
that
important,
given
what
this
petitioner
did
himself?
he
didn't
wait
for
there
to
be
a
retroactivity
decision
to
file
the
2255
motion.
he
filed
the
2255
motion
before
the
ross
case
was
decided.
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
perfectly...
the...
the
prisoner
is
perfectly
able
to
file
the
2255
motion
after
the
first
cause
is
satisfied,
the
date
on
which
the
right
asserted
was
initially
recognized.
this
movant
was
too
late,
if
you
measured
the
year
from
that
right
but
he
wasn't...
he
wasn't
waiting
for
any
retroactivity
decision.
he
filed
before
the
retroactivity
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
on
your
view
of
it,
his
complaint,
when
it
was
filed,
should
have
been
dismissed
as
not
ripe
because
he
didn't
have
the
final
element--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
is,
the
retroactivity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can...
do
you
understand
the...
the
difference
between
what
is
a
right
initially
recognized
and
then
what
is
a
right
newly
recognized?
the
statute
is
supposed
three
requirements:
initially
recognized,
newly
recognized,
and
made
retroactive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
on
your
theory,
there
wouldn't
be
much
in
the
way
of
resources
because
you
say
there's
no
ripe
claim
until
the
retroactivity
decision
comes
down.
why
wouldn't
a
district
judge,
faced
with
this
dilemma,
simply
say,
well,
i'll
just
hold
this
complaint
until
the...
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
supreme
court
rules
on
retroactivity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it's
not
that...
if
it
isn't
the
district
court
in
that
case,
then
you...
the
district
court
has
to
take
this
complaint
and
just
freeze
it
until
some
other...
a
higher
court
rules
on
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about...
i
think
the
principal
argument
that
ms.
bergmann
made
was
your
reading
means
people...
you're
encouraging
filings
that
inevitably
will
be
thrown
out
because
the
right
will
be
made
retroactive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
other...
the
other
way
avoids
loading
the
district
court
with
filings
that
are
futile.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
see,
you're...
you're
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
district
court
should
take
these
filings,
should
not
hold
them.
it
should
itself
make
the
retroactivity
determination.
