justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
look
at
the
trouble
we
get
into
when
we
take
your
interpretation.
suppose
we
take
the
government's
interpretation
and
think
only
of
first
habeas.
leave
second
habeas
out
of
it
for
a
moment.
but
if
it
were
only
first
habeas
and
those
were
all
the
habeases
in
the
world,
wouldn't
theirs
be
better?
every
prisoner
would
know
that
when
you
get
the
right,
you
file.
okay,
no
problem.
and
you're
going
to
win
if,
and
only
if,
you
get
a
court
to
say
it
was
retroactive.
so
that's
fine.
we
all
know.
all
the
prisoners
know
we've
got
to
file
within
a
year.
it
would
cause
no
problem
if
there
were
only
first
habeases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
they
sometimes
don't,
but
then
if
they
don't,
you
appeal,
just
like
anything
else.
and
you
might
lose
and
you
might
not
get
your
case
taken
in
the
supreme
court.
that's
always
true
for
every
litigant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
that's
a
problem.
is
there
any
other
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
that's...
that's
linguistic.
i'm...
i'm
looking
for
practical
problems
for
prisoners,
which
was
your
initial
argument.
and
in
respect
to
a
practical
problem
for
a
prisoner,
i
couldn't
think
of
one,
and
that's
why
i'm
asking.
in
respect
to
first
habeases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
if
your
only
problem
is
second
habeas,
there
i'd
agree
with
you.
there's
a
big
problem.
but
it
says
here
the
date
on
which
the
right
asserted
was
initially
recognized.
now,
i
guess
a
person
who's
filed
a
habeas
doesn't
have
a
right
until
the
supreme
court
has
made
the...
the
rule
retroactive.
and
therefore,
until
the
supreme
court
makes
it
retroactive,
there
was
no
right
recognized
for
a
second
habeas
person.
and
therefore,
for
that
case
it
does
begin
to
run
when
the
supreme
court
says
it's
retroactive
because
prior
to
that
he
had
no
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--given...
given
paragraph
8.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
all...
the
word
right
in
(3)
quite
plainly
doesn't
cover
the
last
six
words
of
the...
of
the
sentence.
well,
whether
the
word
right...
i'm
trying
to
fix
it
up.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
do
we
get
to
that
conclusion.
now,
it
seems
to
me
what
you've
done
is
say
either
use
my
ad
hoc
mechanism,
or
let
there
be
chaos,
or
we
take
your
approach
which
produces
the
kind
of
chaos
we've
just
been
discussing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
actually
justice
souter's
approach
might
work
here
because
you...
you...
all
the
second
habeases
file
immediately.
now,
the
seventh
circuit,
you
say,
well,
gets
to
those
second
habeases
right
away,
and
it
says
dismissed.
very
well.
when
they
say
dismissed,
then
they
ask
for
cert.
and
when
they
ask
for
cert,
we
take
or
we
don't.
if
we
don't,
then
they're
out
of
luck.
and
if
we
take
it,
people
would
hold
all
the
other
cases
waiting
to
see
what
we
decide.
so
they
wouldn't
lose
out
in
any
case
where
we
really
were
going
to
make
it
collaterally...
applicable
on
collateral
review.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i'm
sure
my
dissent
was
correct
in
that
case,
but
the--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
the...
still...
it
still
would
work
because
the
first
case
has
come
down.
okay?
the
first
case
has
come
down.
now
all
the
prisoners
read
about
these
cases,
and
even
if
they've
already
filed
a
habeas,
they
go
file
another.
and
the
seventh
circuit,
you
say,
then
looks
at
that
first
one
that
they
get
to,
and
they
say,
dismissed.
oh,
you're
saying
that
then
he
comes
he
here
and
we
say
the
reason
you
lose
is
not
because
you're
wrong.
the
reason
you
lose
is
because
you're
not
yet
ripe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we...
we
still
might
be
able
to
deal
with
it.
that
person
files
his
petition
for
cert.
he
puts
in
the
petition
there
are
4,000
prisoners
who
are
trying
to
file
second
habeases,
and
if
you
decide
retroactivity,
collateral,
all
of
them
but
me
will
be
able
to
proceed.
but
you
have
to
have
enough
sense,
supreme
court,
to
take
my
case
to
decide
if
you're
going
to
decide
retroactivity,
that
it
is
and
give
me
the
benefit
of
the
decision.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
there...
it's...
i'm
now
taken
with
this.
i'm
jumping
from
one
thing
to
another
here.
but
that
does
get
rid
of
the
problems
that
were
initially
plaguing
your
position
because
it's
precise
and
definite.
and
it
also
gets
rid
of
whatever
problems
were
produced
by
tyler
because
a
person
could
easily
get
to
the
supreme
court
in
that
rare
case
without
his
petition,
if
it's
a
first
petition,
being
improperly
filed
because
he's
not
bound
by
paragraph
8.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
a
first
position.
so
all
that
he
does
is
he
files
a
petition.
he
can
file
it
before
any
court...
nothing
says
he
can't
file
it
before
a
court
has
decided
it's
retroactive.
he
files
the
petition.
he
seeks
cert
here.
he
gets
us
to
say
it's
retroactive
in
that
rare
instance,
and
everyone
else
has
a
year
from
that
moment.
and
as
far
as
the...
the
second
people
are
concerned,
they
don't...
the
second
petition
people
don't
have
to
file
it
until
a
year
from
that
moment,
and
they
have
a
good
claim
under
paragraph
8.
there's
quite
a
lot...
now...
now,
i'm
jumping
to
that
because
it
sounds
like
it
might
be
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
don't
worry
about
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was
very--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
if
you
don't...
aren't...
i
mean,
the
language
is
open,
and
it's
sort
of
like
the
virtue
of
this...
suddenly
it's
like
tinkers
to
everest
chance.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
put
everything
together.
what
was
worrying
you
most
about
their
position
was
it
produced
uncertainty,
a
kind
of
a
mess.
you
don't
know
which
court
you're
talking
about.
people
would
be
filing
things
all
over
the
place.
they'll
be
waiting.
that...
it's
a
mess.
this
stops
that.
what's
worrying
them
is
that
the
second
habeas
person,
given
tyler,
could
never
file,
not
even
in
that...
you
know,
not
even
in
that...
in
that
really
unusual
situation
where
we're
going
to
make
a
collateral
review.
and
now,
what
this
does
is
it
produces
the
certainty,
the
definiteness
of
when
your
time
clock
begins
to
tick,
and
it
eliminates
all
the
uncertainty,
et
cetera,
and
confusion,
difficulty
from
their
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
language...
the
language
is
on
your
side,
i
think
there's
no
doubt.
but
it's
not
unambiguous.
imagine
a
prison
rule
that
says
that
the...
after
the
prison
board,
the...
the
prisoner
has
2
weeks
to
appeal
to
the
warden
from
the
time
of
the
decision
of
the
board
if
the
prisoner
has
been
notified.
the
prisoner
isn't
notified
for
3
weeks.
i
think
we'd
read
that
to
say
he
has
2
weeks
from
the
time
of
notification.
you...
you
can
use
can
if
in
that
way.
it's
not
impossible.
and
once
i
begin
to
think
it
could
be
open,
i
think,
well,
let's
look
for
the
most
practical
approach.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you...
you'd
say,
well
the
language
is
clear...
clear,
but
let's
go...
let's
go
on
equitable
tolling.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
what
you're
saying
is
the
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
dreeben,
could
i
bring
you
back
to
the...
the
issue?
i'm
sorry.
yes.
can
i
bring
you
back
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
court
that
recognizes
the
right
has
to
be
the
supreme
court
or
not?
you
say
there
are
three
other
instances
in
which
it
is
specified
that
it
be
the
supreme
court,
and
it's
not
specified
here.
but
does
any
of
those
other
three
instances
involve
language
like
this
which...
which
has
the
supreme
court
mentioned
immediately
previously?
i
mean,
when
i
read
that
the
first
time,
has
been
newly
recognized
by
the
supreme
court
and
made
retroactively
applicable
to
cases,
i
mean,
i
think
what
it
envisions
is
the...
the
very
decision
of
the
supreme
court
that
newly
recognized
it
made
it
retroactively
applicable.
is...
is
any
of
the
other
ones
phrased
this
way
so
that
the
word,
the
supreme
court,
is
immediately
preceding
the
and
made
retroactively
applicable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
it
would
do...
let's
take
a
case
which
i
guess
we...
apprendi.
i
mean,
you
know,
apprendi,
a
big
sort
of
an
issue
in
the
courts.
and...
and
this
would
put
tremendous
pressure
on
us
to
decide
it
immediately,
wouldn't
it?
we'd
have
to
say
immediately
whether
it
was
going
to
be
retroactive
or
not
retroactive
because
it's
only
likely
to
come
along
in
some
major,
major
matter
like
that,
other
than
the
kind
justice
kennedy
said,
which
is
another
kind
of
problem.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
a
way,
if
we
take
your
approach,
of
getting
out
of
this
tremendous
pressure.
maybe
it
would
be
a
good
thing.
but
i
don't
think
there's
a
way
of
getting
out
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
do
you
think
about
the...
it
seems
to
me
we've
tried
three
approaches,
each
of
which
try
to
get
us
out
of
this
problem
of
the
pressure,
call
it.
and
we
have
justice
stevens'
and
then...
but
there
were
certain
problems
with
justice
souter's,
which
still
i'm
not
certain
might...
then
i
had
started
with
one
that
i
guess
the
objection
to
it
would
be
it's
laughable.
but...
but
is
there...
is
there
any...
i
mean,
you
see,
it's...
it's
reading...
it's
reading
the
word
right
in
6
to
encompass
all
of
the
paragraph
in
8.
is
there
anything...
i
mean,
it's
a
pretty
good
objection
that
really
that
just
goes
too
far.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
there
any
other
objection?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
could
be,
if
you
want
to
play
games,
there
is
an
imaginary
right
to
which
blackstone
has
referred
48
times.
yet,
for
some
odd
reason,
that
right
has
never
come
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
but
one
day
it
does.
it
is
a
right
of
constitutional
dimensions
embedded
in
the
law
of
stoppage
in
transitu.
and
although
it's
well
recognized,
we've
never
had
a
case.
finally,
we
get
one,
and
it
is
initially
recognized
here,
but
it
is
not
newly
recognized
for
every
treatise
on
stoppage
in
transitu
has
long
assumed
that
it
was
part
of
the
law
of
the
united
states.
i
don't
know.
that's
what
i
thought
it
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
that
what
i've
just
said
is
of
total
irrelevance
to
everything.
is...
is
that
right?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
how
is...
how
does
that
work?
i
mean,
can
you
explain
that
a
little?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
he
did...
he
hasn't
violated
the
statute
of
limitations.
he...
he
filed
it
before
a
year
ran
from
the
time
that
we
finally
recognized
it
because
we
haven't
even
recognized
it
yet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
is
premature?
what
prevents
a
person
from
being
premature?
they
just
might
lose
on
the
merits
of
their
claim
is
all,
and
he
might
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i...
i
was
the
one
who's
having
a
problem.
i...
i
didn't
see
how
your
client
would
be
hurt
if
we
adopted
justice
stevens'--
