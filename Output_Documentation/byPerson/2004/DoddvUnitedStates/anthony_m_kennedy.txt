justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
those
cases,
would
the
government
ever
on
its
own
motion
have
a
defendant
retried
or
released?
has
that
ever
happened?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
think
it
has.
if...
let
me
ask
you
this.
if...
if
a
decision
says
that
what
was
a
crime,
as
defined
to
the
jury,
is
no
longer
a
crime...
the
conduct
was
no
longer
a
crime...
i
take
it
teague
doesn't
necessarily
apply
to
that,
but
this
is
still
a
substantive
rule
that's
retroactive.
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what...
what
interest
does
the
government
have
in
holding
somebody
when
the
conduct
for
which
he
was
convicted
is
no
longer
a
crime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
don't
you
let
the
guy
go?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
say
he's
being--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let's
say
he's
being
held
because
the
government
insists
that
it's
not
retroactive
and
the
government
is
then
proven
wrong.
would
that
let
him
qualify
under
(2)
because
then
the...
the
impediment
to
making
the
motion
was
the
fact
that
he
thought
it
was
not
retroactive,
but
then...
and
that
was
government
action
because
that's
what
you
insisted
on.
but
then
that's
removed.
so
does...
so
would...
does
entitlement
under
(2)
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
don't
think
this
is
going
to
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
but
it
is
because
he...
it
hasn't
been
found
retroactive
yet
and
he
can't
file--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--under
your
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
prevented
him
from
filing
effectively.
i
mean--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
petition
has
to
be
dismissed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
probably
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
courts
in...
in
your
view
have
to
make
the
retroactivity
finding?
the
district
court?
the
circuit
where
he's...
which
has
jurisdiction
over
his
case?
any
circuit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
if
10
other
circuits
have
ruled
on
this
but
not
his
own,
there's
nothing
he
can
do
until
somebody
within
the
1-year
window
files.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your...
your
position
is
strengthened
by
the
other
three
provisions
of
the
statute
that
mentioned
this,
but
it's
not
controlled
by
that,
i
take
it.
you
think
it's
unambiguous
just
as
it
read...
as
it's
read
on
its
own.
