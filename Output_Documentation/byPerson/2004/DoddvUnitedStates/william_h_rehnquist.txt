we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
04-5286,
michael
dodd
v.
united
states.
ms.
bergmann.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
it's
a
nullity,
what
you
really
mean
is
it
allows
for
very...
very
little
relief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
is
that
an
argument
in
your
favor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
say
that
it
doesn't
grant
as
much
relief
as
it
might
have
doesn't
render
the
statute
absurd.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
may
be
just
a
generic
use
of
the
term
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
problem
with
your
argument,
ms.
bergmann,
seems
to
be
addressed
to
the
idea
that
congress
intended
to
sweep
quite
broadly
here.
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
necessary
inference
at
all.
we're
dealing
with
a
situation,
as
justice
o'connor
points
out,
where
we
have
very
rarely
held
that
a
decision
is
retroactive.
so
it's
already
a
very
small
class
of
cases,
and
the
government's
view
makes
it
an
even
smaller
class
of
cases.
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
statute
doesn't
work.
it
just
means
it
doesn't
work
for
a
lot
of
people
who
are
excluded
from
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
bergmann.
mr.
feldman,
we'll

from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
ms.
bergmann,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
bergmann.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
dodd
versus
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
