mr.

chief

william

rehnquist
but,
you
know,
when
you
say
it
eases
burdens,
it
doesn't
just
ease
burdens
imposed
by
the
federal
government.
it
eases
burdens
imposed
by
state
governments.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in...
in
the
city
of
boerne,
didn't
we
say
that
congress
couldn't
come
in
and
simply
rewrite
some
part
of
the
constitution
to
make
it
read
differently
than
we
had?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
haven't
we
said
in
at
least
one
of
our
cases
that
the
government
can't
favor
religion
over
irreligion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

that
before
us
on
the
questions
presented?

william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--when
you
use
the
term
bona
fide,
you're
introducing
a
new
kind
of
factor.
do
courts
evaluate
the
bona
fides
of
someone
claiming
a
religion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldberger.
mr.
cole,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william

rehnquist
but
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
pass
on
the
spending...
spending
clause
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
isn't
raised
by
your
opponent's
petition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
if
we're
looking
for
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

is.
thank
you,
mr.
