justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
clement,
it
seems
to
me
the
spending
clause
aspect
cuts
in
the
other
direction,
if
we're
just
focusing
on
the
establishment
clause.
the
fact
that
federal
money
is
involved,
why
does
that
make
your
burden
any
less
in
defending
the...
the
statute
under
the
establishment
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you...
do
you
think
the
establishment
clause
issue
in
this
case
would
be
the
same
as
the
establishment
clause
issue
in
city
of
boerne
if
we...
if
the
court
had
reached
the
establishment
clause
issue
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
cole?
i
am
troubled
also,
as
you
point
out,
about
the
least
restrictive
language
in
the
statute.
but
as
i
try
and
apply
it
to
this
particular
case,
weren't
most
of
the
allegations
that
the
petitioners
made
is
that
they
were
treated
differently
from
other
mainstream
religions
and
that
the
accommodation
would
have
been,
well,
treat
them
the
same,
which
would
have
been
the
least
restrictive
alternative?
it
wouldn't
have
created
all
the
problems
you
describe.
and
they
say
they
don't...
can't
have
group
meetings.
they...
if
they
were
treated
exactly
the
same,
would
that...
that
would
satisfy
the
least
restrictive
alternative
part
of
the
statute,
wouldn't
it?
and
why
would
that
be
such
a
burden?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
mainstream
religion
adherents
have
certain
objects
they'd
like
to
keep
in
their
cell?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
mainstream
person,
if
there's
a
potential
for
harm,
they
wouldn't
let
them
keep
it
in
the...
in
the
cell,
would
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
other
words,
is
it
really...
although
the
language
in
the
statute
seems
to
go
farther,
is
there
anything
really
at
stake
here
beyond
saying
treat
us
the
same
as
you
treat
mainstream...
members
of
mainstream
religions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
best
example
of
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
that
would
be
a
compelling
interest
to
say
you
can't
do
that.
