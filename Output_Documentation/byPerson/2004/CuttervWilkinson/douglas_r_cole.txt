mr.
douglas
r.
cole
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
prison's
unique
environment,
rluipa
violates
the
constitution.
it
directly
and
impermissibly
advances
religion
and
it
would
have
to
be...
have
to
be...
perceived
by
objective
observers
as
endorsement.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
i
think
you
are,
your
honor,
and
if
our
brief
came
across
that
way,
i...
i
think
it
overstates
the
line
that
we're
asking
this
court
to
draw.
the
court
has
recognized,
in
talking
about
accommodations,
that
of
course
accommodations
by
their
nature
benefit
religion.
that's
part
of
an
accommodation
and
could
be
said
to
have
the
effect.
but
the
court
has
said
then
we
must
draw
lines.
that
is,
the
court
has
recognized
that
you
can't
just
say,
oh,
it's
an
accommodation
which
means
that's
fine,
it's
always
going
to
be
fine
if
it's
an
accommodation.
in
fact,
justice
o'connor
said
we
need
to
draw
lines
because
otherwise
everything
will
just
become,
oh,
that's
an
accommodation.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
the
line
is
violated
here,
your
honor,
because
of
the
unique
incentives
and
burdens
that
arise
in
the
prison
context.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
but
in...
in
prison's
unique
environment,
your
honor,
where
there
are
so
many
deprivations
of
liberty
and
then
to
say
the
one...
one
way
you
can
get
out
from
under
the
thumb
of
all
these
prison
regulations
is
to
claim
religion,
and
that's
going
to
give
you
a
powerful
weapon
not
again
to--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--but...
but
the
court
has...
has
always
articulated
that
the
rules...
well,
in
turner
and
o'lone,
the
court
articulated
that
the
rules
are
different
in
prison,
citing
to
the
intractable
problems
of
prison
administration
and
the...
and
the
problems
of
subjecting--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--no,
your
honor.
going...
going
back
to
the
beto
case,
the
court
said
free
exercise
applies
in
prison,
but
in
o'lone,
the
court
said
it
applies
in
prison
but
the
standard
what
we're
going
to
use
is
one
that's
very
similar
to...
to
rational
basis.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
we're
not
asking
for
that
bright
line
rule,
your
honor.
it
could
well
be
the
case
that
providing
kosher
meals,
for
instance,
whether
that's
required
by
the
free
exercise
clause
or
not,
it
might
go
marginally
beyond
what
free
exercise
requires.
that's
an
accommodation
that
would
be
perfectly
legitimate.
but
to
have
a
rule
that
says
anytime
you
bring
any
request
of
any
kind
for
an
accommodation
from
any
rule,
it's
going
to
be
treated
differently
and
better
because
it's
religion--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
that
far.
i...
i
think
we
could
look
at
given
types
of
accommodations
and
say
if
a
legislative
determination
is
made
that
this
type
of
accommodation
with
respect
to
this
type
of
request
is
appropriate,
based
on
a
balancing
of
all
the
factors
to
consider
in
that
particular
case--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--that
might
not
slide--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
a
narrow,
targeted...
i
guess
the
point
is,
your
honor,
a
narrow,
targeted
accommodation
would
be
different
in
our
view
than
this
broad,
wonder
bus
approach
to
accommodation.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
no,
your
honor,
i...
i
don't
believe
so
because
i
think
if,
for
instance,
the
legislature
said,
you...
you
shall,
absent
some
compelling
need,
provide
prisoners
with
a
diet
that
meets
their
religious
requirements,
that
would
not
discriminate
among
religions.
it
would
be
narrowly
tailored
to
some
perceived
problem
that
might
exist.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
and,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
in
prison's
unique
environment,
to
the
extent
you
go
beyond
the
free
exercise
clause,
it
raises
special
problems
and
special
concerns
that
need
to
be
dealt
with--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
it's
insufficient,
your
honor,
because
it
doesn't
change
the
underlying
fact
that
the
request
itself,
whatever
the
ultimate
outcome
on
the
request
is,
the
request
itself
gets
treated
differently
and
better
merely
because
it's
religion.
this
is
a--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--no,
your
honor.
i'm...
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
and...
and
as
the
court
noted
in
amos,
these
type
of
statutes
are
necessarily
going
to
single
out
religion,
but
that
doesn't
shield
them
from
establishment
clause
scrutiny
just
because
they
take
the
form
of
being
directed
at
religion
and
providing
a
benefit
that's...
that's
labeled
as
an
accommodation.
i
mean,
for
instance,
congress
could
say,
look,
we
think
it's
difficult
for
state
prisoners
to
practice
their
religious
beliefs
when
they
can't
go
to
church.
so
absent
some
compelling
state
interest
and
least
restrictive
alternatives,
the
prisons
need
to
arrange
to
release
prisoners
once
a
week
to
go
to
the
church
or
synagogue
of
their
choice.
well,
that
would
provide
an
awfully
powerful
incentive
inside
prison
walls
for
prisoners
to...
to
claim
religion.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
thank
you,
your
honor.
that
is--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--no,
they
did
not,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
an
important
as
well,
that
once
someone
has
an...
a
bona
fide
religion
and...
and
prison
officials
can
challenge
whether
this
is
in
fact
a
religious
set
of
beliefs.
but
if
they
have
a
religious
set
of
beliefs
and
if
they
are
sincere,
then
you
can't
challenge
this
particular
request
as
not
being
mandated
by
the
religion.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
for
religious
reasons,
i
would
prefer
to
do
this.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
your
honor,
i
wish
i
could
draw
a
brighter
line
rule
than--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--your
honor--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--it's
the
magnitude
by
which
congress
has
enhanced
the
religious
right.
that
is,
we
compare
what
the
constitution
requires
state
prison
officials
to
do
and
we
say,
how
far
has
congress
moved
the
ball.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
our
argument
is
pinned
on
this
court's
decisions
in
turner
and
o'lone,
which
we
see
as
establishing
the
baseline
for
what
type...
for
what
the
constitution
requires
in
terms
of
free
exercise
in
prison,
and
then
we'll
use
that
baseline
and
compare
the
standard
imposed
there
to
the
standard
congress
is
seeking
to
impose
through
rluipa
and
compare
the
magnitude
of
the
two,
understanding,
as
this
court
has
said
in
lemon,
that
lines
of
demarcation
are
difficult
to
perceive.
it's
difficult
to
say
exactly
where
that
line
should
be.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
i...
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
given
prison's
unique
environment.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
i
believe
turner
and
o'lone
are
prison
cases
that
talk
about
what
the
constitution
means
in
prison,
understanding
that
in
prison
there
need
to
be
changes
to
what
we
would
otherwise
see
as
the
inmates'
constitutional
rights
if
they
were
not
in
prison.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
burdens
in
the
prison
environment
are
twofold.
first,
rluipa
forces
prison
officials
to
change
the
balance
they
would
otherwise
strike
between
safety
and
accommodation,
and
by
changing
that
balance,
changing
the
margin
of
safety,
if
you
will,
they're
now
imposing
risks
on
the
other
inmates
that
are
in
prison.
and
these
aren't
merely--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--yes,
your
honor.
and
compelling
state
interest
doesn't
present
a
problem
to
the
state
of
ohio
or
to
the
other
states
that
are
operating
under
this
statute.
what
it...
what
presents
the
problem
is
the
least
restrictive
alternative
part
of
that
which
subjects
state
prison
officials
in
their
day-to-day
judgments
regarding
prison
operations
to
a
strict
scrutiny
analysis
on
the
back
end.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
the...
the
least
restrictive
alternative,
which
is
what
puts
the
teeth
in
rluipa
and
what's...
what
creates
the
problem--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
the
united
states
claims
no,
your
honor,
of
course.
but
when
we
look
back
at
the
experience
of
the
states
with
rfra,
before
it
was
declared
unconstitutional,
we
presented
substantial
evidence
in
the...
in
the
joint
appendix
with
regard
to
the
way
in
which
there
was
an
explosion
of
demands
for
accommodations
by
prisoners
from
previously
unheard
of
religions.
there
was
an
expansion...
an
explosion
of
claims
of
conversion
within--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
difficulty
that
doesn't
seem
to
go
away
with
the
least
restrictive
alternative
test
is...
is
the
possibility,
as
this
court
noted
in
turner,
that
every
judgment
every
day
is
subject
to
some
court
somewhere
finding
that
there
was
a
less
restrictive
way
of
achieving
the
goal.
and...
and
we
see
that--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
that's
not
particularly
encouraging,
your
honor,
but--
[laughter]
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
yes,
your
honor.
and...
and
i
guess
all
i
can
do
is
go
back
and
compare
the
accommodation
if
that's
what
this
is
that's
at
issue
here
with
that
that
was
at
issue
in
amos
to
say
these
employers
don't
need
to
comply
with
this
one
federal
statute
and
this
one
set
of
obligations.
and
i
asked,
well,
okay,
so
an
employer.
is
that
going
to
make
ibm
switch
from
being
a
computer
manufacturer
to
being
a
religious
services
provider
because,
boy,
if
we
do
that,
we
can
get
out
from
underneath
title
vii's
nondiscrimination
mandate?
i
don't
think
so.
but
if
i
look
in
prison
and
i
say,
what
is
going
to
be
the
effect
on
the
ground
with
respect
to
people
claiming
religion
or
converting
to
religion
if
i
tell
them
there's
going
to
be
a
different
regulatory
regime
that
applies
to
you--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--your
honor,
i...
i
don't
know
that
it
hasn't.
i
mean,
i'm...
i'm
surprised
in
a
sense
to
hear
that
claim
because
in
brief
period
in
which
rfra
did
apply
to
state
prisons,
there
was
an
explosion
of
these
demands.
and...
and
i
would
direct
the
court
to,
i
believe
it's,
204,
210,
211,
and
212
in
the
joint
appendix
to
see
some
of
the
ways
in
which
there's
been
this
impact.
i'd
also--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
the
fact
that...
that
strict
scrutiny
might
become...
what
that
means,
what
that's
going
to
require.
and
arguably,
this
is
a
slightly
different
strict
scrutiny
than
other
strict
scrutinies
because
of
some
of
the
legislative
history,
to
the
extent
one...
one
wants
to
look
at
that.
and...
and
that's,
i
guess,
the
problem.
as
we
flesh
that
out,
during
that
entire
time,
we're
saying
it's
all
right
to
burden
other
inmates
in
prisons.
it's
all
right
to
burden
prison
officials.
it's
all
right
for
congress
not
to
burden
federal
prison
officials,
but
for
congress
to
burden
state
prison
officials
with
this
new
set
of
obligations.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i'm--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
for...
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first,
this
also
purports
to
be
commerce
clause
legislation,
in
which
case
it
would
be
a
mandate
upon
the
states
whether--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--but...
but
secondly,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
spending
clause
issue,
this
court
has
said
in
dole
that
there
needs
to
be
relatedness
between
the
spending,
that
if
there's
going
to
be
strings
attached,
they
actually
have
to
be
attached
to
the
federal
money
in
some
meaningful
way.
and
here,
congress
is
relying
on
spending,
most
of
which
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--no,
they
did
not,
your
honor,
but
we--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--that's...
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
it
is
available
to
the
court
as
an
alternate
ground
of
affirmance
of...
of
the
decision
below.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
well,
your
honor--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
our
theory
isn't
that
anytime
you
go
beyond
what
free
exercise
requires,
you're
immediately
into
an
establishment
clause
violation.
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
play
in
the
joints.
and
providing
chaplains,
given
the...
the
rich
history
and
tradition
of
doing
so
in
prisons,
seems
to
fall
very
comfortably
within
that
play
in
the
joints.
the
question
is
when
have
we
gone
too
far.
when
has
our
accommodation
slid
over,
as
the
dissent
put
it
in
texas
monthly,
into
a...
or
an
impermissible
incentive
to
practice
religion?
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
your
honor,
first,
i'm
not
sure
that
their
claim
is
that,
oh,
we're
being
treated
differently
and
worse.
their
claim
was
we
want
to
get
together
for
congregate
religious
services
or,
in
mr.
hampton's
case...
he
was
a
wicca...
he
wanted
certain
objects,
including
a
quartz
crystal
that
he
would
be
able
to
keep
in
his
cell.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
they...
they
may
well,
your
honor,
and...
and
the
point
is
in
each
of
those
cases,
prison
officials
look
at
the
object
and
say
what's
the
potential
for
harm
here.
should
we
let
them
have
it
in
their
cell?
there's
a...
there's
a
practice
in
ohio
prisons
of--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
absolutely,
your
honor.
absolutely.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
there's
a...
a
request
for
a
prisoner
who
wants
the
grooming
regulations
changed
with
respect
to
him.
he's
a
prisoner
who's
got
a
history
of
contraband
violations.
he's
involved
in
a...
in
a
prison
betting
pool
and
carries...
tries
to
carry
betting
slips
and
secret
them
on
his
person.
and
so
if
he
could
violate
the
grooming
regulations,
the
concern
is
he
might
use
that
to
hide
contraband.
there
are
prisoners
that
want
to
wear
their
hair
in
a
certain
way
to
signify
gang
affiliation,
and
instead,
they
claim,
well,
i
need
this
for
religious
purposes,
but
what's
really
going
on
is
they
want
to
signify
gang
affiliation.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
your
honor,
again,
i'm...
i'm
sure
there's
a
compelling
interest.
the
question
is
the
least
restrictive
alternative.
are
we
going
to
be
able
to
meet
every
federal
judges'
view
of
is
this
the
least
restrictive
way
we
could
go
about
achieving
this
compelling
interest?
there's
no
doubt
that
prison
security
is
going
to
be
recognized
as
a
compelling
state
interest,
but
the
difficulty
is
the
least
restrictive
alternative
test.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
frankly,
your
honor,
other
than
rfra,
it's
the
only
time
congress
has
gone
this
far.
and
so
to
say
that
there's
a
lack
of
case
law
on
this
is
more
to
suggest
that
there's
been
settled
understandings
that
we
can't
go
this
far
rather
than--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--in
our
brief
we...
we
looked
at
lee
v.
weisman
in
what
the
court
called
subtle
and
indirect
coercion
to
religion
when
it
was
merely
standing
for
a...
a
invocation
during
graduation
once
a
year.
and
we
contrast
that
with
what's
going
on
here
and
the
constant
pressure
day
after
day,
if
you
want
this
set
of
benefits,
get
religion.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
again,
your
honor,
it's
not
that
we
couldn't
potentially
win
these
cases
under
least
restrictive
alternative.
the
question
is
by
changing
the
standard
to
that,
changing
the
standard
to
one
in
which
these
prison
officials...
i
mean,
congress
is,
in
a
sense,
asking
federal
judges
to
sit
as
overseers
of
religious
life
in
the
prisons
across
the
50
states.
and
given
what
this
court
said
in
turner,
given
what
this
court
said
in
o'lone
about
the
intractable
problems
that
prison
officials
face,
it
just
seems
an
inappropriate
task
and
one
that,
if
motivated
with
the
desire
of
increasing
religiosity
in
prison,
seems
to
cross
the
establishment--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--right,
and
it's--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--except,
your
honor,
this
court
noted
in
turner,
i
believe
it
was,
that
the
need
for
judicial
deference
is
particularly
strong
when
you're
dealing
with
situations
that
create
ripple
effects
in
prison.
and
it's
difficult
for
federal
judges
to
know.
they
don't
have
prison
management
experience.
they
don't
have
20
years
on
the
ground
like
most
prison
wardens
do
to
say
this...
this
accommodation
will
work
and
this
one
won't.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
if
they
will,
it's
not
in
the
face
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
i
mean,
it's
not
in
the
face
of
the
statute.
it
says
compelling
state
interest
and
least
restrictive
alternative.
i
would
just
like
to
note--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
i
believe
mr.
clement
noted
that...
that
there
was
a
case
that
held
that,
okay,
you
can't
wear
the
medallion
on
the
outside
of
your
shirt,
you
can
wear
it
on
the
inside
of
your
shirt.
so
that
would
be
a
less
restrictive
alternative
for
not
allowing
you
to
use
the
medallion,
i
guess,
as
a
gang
identifier.
now,
it
doesn't
really
deal
with
the
problem
that
as
soon
as
the
guard
is
not
looking,
again
it
can
be
pulled
outside
the
shirt
and
can
be
used
as
a
gang
identifier.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
maybe,
your
honor,
but...
but
the
question
is,
is
it
permissible
for
congress
to
create
incentives
for
prisoners
to
say,
yes,
i'm
religious
because
i
want
these
other
benefits?
can
congress
really
say,
boy,
we'd
like
you
to
be
religious,
and
the
way
we're
going
to
provide
that
incentive
is
by
giving
you
a
better
shot
at
getting
out
from
the
rules
in
prison?
it's
not
a
guaranteed
shot
from
getting
out,
but
it's
a
better
shot
at
getting
out
from
the
rules
that
apply
to
everybody
else
in
prison
and
to
get
that,
you
have
to
become
religious.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
better
shot
than--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--well,
and
your
honor,
i
was
not
careful
there.
i
should
say
much
better
shot.
i
mean,
again,
it's
this
point
that--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i--
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
--i
think
by
comparing
to
what's
gone
before.
in
fact,
the
court
has
adopted
a
version
of
that
approach
already.
in
caldor,
the
court
said
if
it's
unqualified
and
imposes
a
burden
on
others,
that's
going
to
violate
the
establishment
clause.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
r.
cole
thank
you.
