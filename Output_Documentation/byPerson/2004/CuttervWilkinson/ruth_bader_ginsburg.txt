is
that...
what
you're
saying
is
academic
because
the
statute
doesn't
require
a
federal
spending
hook.
it
says
it
has
the
other
commerce
peg.
i
take
it
you...
you
gave
a
pragmatic
answer
to
that,
that
every
state
in
fact
gets
federal
funds
for
their
prison
systems.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
garb
that
is
said
to
be
associated
with
the
religion
but
also
is
used
as
a
cue
for
gang
membership?
let's
say
a
beard.
this
religion
requires
me
to
wear
a
beard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
about
a
religion
that
it's
a
genuine
tenet
of
the
religion
that
the
races
are
to
be
separated
and
the
person
says,
the
accommodation
i
want
is
never
to
be
celled
with
someone
who
is
not
of
my
race?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
what
extent?
i
asked
the...
the
racist...
the
religion
that
says
god
wanted
the
races
to
be
separated
and
the
accommodation
is
do
not
cell
me
with
someone
of
another
race.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
racist
literature
but
it's
under
the
aegis
of
a
religious
organization?
and
that...
suppose
the
prison
does
not
permit,
say,
a
member
of
the
aryan
nation
to
get
that
racist
literature...
to
get
racist
literature
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
the
content
discrimination,
i
take
it,
would
be
raised
by
someone
who
wants
to
get
this
for
political
or
psychological
reasons--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
would
say,
i'm
not
challenging
the
right
of
the...
as
a
member
of
this
religious
sect.
i
just
say,
me
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
now
have
some
experience
in
the
federal
system
where
the
same
standards
apply
under
rfra.
and
you
are
positing
terrible
disturbance
of
prison
administration
in
the...
what
is
it...
6
years
that...
that
rfra
has
been
in
force
for
federal
prisons.
have
there
been...
has
there
been
this
terrible
disruption?
have
there
been...
have
the
accommodations
required
so
much
of
the
prison
administrators?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
now
that
some
of
that
has
gotten
sorted
out
through
the
experience
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
on
the
federal
side,
one
would
expect
there
would
be
less
of
those
far-out
claims.
the...
you
would
expect
when
a
statute
is
new,
that
there
might
be
some
claims
that
we
would
recognize
as
frivolous
after
there's
been
experience
under
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
one
question
brought
up
about
ohio's
own
practice.
but
you...
you
say
we
have
no
obligation
to
relieve
burdens.
if
we
did,
we
would
violate
the
establishment
clause.
the
point
was
made
that
ohio
pays
for
chaplains,
but
it
doesn't
pay
for,
say,
psychologists
to
come
in
for
agnostics.
so
aren't
you
right
there
violating
the
establishment
clause
on
your
own
theory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you...
can
you
give
me
an
example?
because
most
of
the
things
i
think
of
is
either
you
can
have
kosher
food
or
you
cannot.
either
you
can
wear
a
yarmulke
or
you're
not.
there's
not
other...
another
alternative.
most
of
these
things
are
yes
and
no.
what
is
the
case
where,
well,
you
can't
have
this
but
we'll
give
you
something
lesser?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
if
the
warden
says
that,
the
court
would
say,
fine,
you
don't
have
to
accommodate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
section
3
of
the
religious
land
use
and
institutionalized
persons
act
of
2000
acronym
rluipa.
section
3
provides
in
key
part,
"no
government
shall
impose
a
substantial
burden
on
the
religious
exercise
of
a
person
residing
in
or
confined
to
an
institution
unless
the
burden
furthers
to
compelling
government
interest"
and
does
so
by
"the
least
restrictive
means."
enacted
pursuant
to
federal
authority
under
the
spending
and
commerce
clauses,
the
act
covers
states
and
their
subdivisions.
plaintiffs
below
petitioners
here
are
current
and
former
inmates
of
institutions
operated
by
the
ohio
department
of
rehabilitation
and
correction.
they
assert
their
true
belief
in
non
mainstream
religions,
the
satanist,
wicca
and
asatru
religions
and
the
church
of
jesus
christ
christian.
they
complain
that
ohio
prison
officials,
respondents
here
in
violation
of
rluipa,
have
failed
to
accommodate
their
religious
exercise
in
a
variety
of
ways.
in
response
to
petitioner’s
complaints,
ohio
prison
officials
have
mounted
a
facial
challenge
to
section
3
of
rluipa.
the
legislation
they
contend
improperly
advances
religion
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment’s
establishment
clause.
ohio
officials
concede
for
purposes
of
the
threshold
challenge
they
here
present
that
the
religions
in
questions
are
genuine
and
the
inmates’
faith
in
them
sincere.
the
district
court
denied
the
prison
officials
motion
to
dismiss
petitioners’
complaints.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
portion
of
rluipa
applicable
to
institutionalized
persons
violates
the
establishment
clause.
we
reverse
that
judgment.
our
decisions
recognize
that
there
is
room
for
play
in
the
joints
between
the
two
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment.
some
space
for
legislative
action
neither
compelled
by
the
pre
exercise
clause
nor
prohibited
by
the
establishment
clause.
section
3
of
the
rluipa,
we
hold
fits
within
the
power
between
the
two
clauses
on
its
face
the
act
qualifies
as
a
permissible
legislative
accommodation
of
religion
that
is
not
barred
by
the
establishment
clause.
foremost,
section
3
is
compatible
with
the
establishment
clause
because
it
alleviates
exceptional
government
created
burdens
on
religious
observances.
the
provision
governs
state
run
institutions,
mental
hospitals,
prisons
and
the
like
in
which
the
government
exerts
a
degree
of
control
unparalleled
in
civilian
society
and
severely
disabling
to
private
religious
exercise.
rluipa
does
protect
institutionalized
persons
who
are
unable
to
exercise
their
religious
freedom
without
the
governments’
permission
and
accommodation.
rluipa,
we
have
stressed,
does
not
elevate
accommodation
of
religious
observances
over
an
institutions’
need
to
maintain
order
and
safety.
an
accommodation
must
be
measured
so
that
it
does
not
override
other
significant
interest.
while
the
act
adopts
a
compelling
interest
least
restrictive
means
test
context
matters
in
the
application
of
that
standard.
law
makers
supporting
rluipa
were
mindful
of
the
urgency
of
discipline,
order,
safety,
and
security
in
penal
institutions.
they
anticipated
that
courts
would
apply
the
act's
standards
with
due
deference
to
prison
administrators’
experience
an
expertise.
vital
too,
the
act
confers
no
privilege
status
on
any
particular
religious
sect.
accordingly,
courts
applying
rluipa
must
be
satisfied
that
sections
3’s
prescriptions
are
and
will
be
administered
neutrally
among
bona
fide
faiths.
the
sixth
circuit
misread
our
precedent
when
it
declared
rluipa
an
impermissible
advancement
of
religion
because
it
gives
greater
protection
to
religious
rights
than
to
other
constitutionally
protected
rights.
where
the
court
of
appeals
declaration
correct
in
all
manner
of
religious
accommodations
would
fall.
ohio,
for
example,
could
not
as
it
now
does
accommodate
traditionally
recognized
religions
by
providing
chaplains
and
allowing
worship
services.
ohio’s
prison
officials,
we
emphasized,
have
raised
a
facial
challenge.
they
have
not
urged
that
in
any
specific
case
applying
the
act
would
produce
unconstitutional
results.
should
inmate
request
for
religious
accommodations
becomes
excessive,
imposed
unjustified
burdens
on
other
institutionalized
persons,
or
jeopardize
an
institution's
effective
functioning,
the
facility
would
be
free
to
resist
the
imposition
in
that
event
and
as
applied
challenge
would
in
order.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
