justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
we've
done
that
in
the
conscientious
objector
cases,
united
states
v.
seeger
and
gillette.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
take
it
underlying
justice
ginsburg's
question
is...
is
the
concern
that
this
accommodation
is
unequal
because
there
are
other
first
amendment
rights
that
are
not
given
the...
that
are
not
given
the
same
precedence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that...
that
was
at
least
an
underlying
concern
of
her
question,
and
i
think
it's
a
legitimate
concern.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
in
amos,
the
court
was
just...
the...
the
government
was
just
saying
that
one
of
its
own
statutes
could
be
accommodated.
this
is
something
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
want
us
to
say
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i...
i
suppose
you're
saying
you
want
us
to
make
the
holding
that...
one
of
the
holdings
you'd
be
satisfied
with
is
that
while
some
accommodation
is...
is
appropriate,
this
is
extreme
accommodation.
what's
your
best
case
for
that?
i...
i
just
can't
remember
a
case
in
which
we've
tried
to
ask
whether
every
form
a
request
for
accommodation
has
to
be
acknowledged.
is...
is
this
the
only
case
that
you've
come
across?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
what
i'm
asking
is
what's
the
closest
analogy
you
can--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you're
asking
us--
