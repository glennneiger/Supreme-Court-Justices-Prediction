mr.
david
a.
goldberger
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
the
facts,
the
underlying
facts,
involving
the
motion
to
dismiss
are
in
dispute,
and
it's
a
serious
dispute.
and
those
should
be
reserved
for...
for
the
court
below,
in
particular
the
claims
that
our
clients'
religions
are
affiliated
with
gang
activities,
but
there
are
serious
disputes
about
that.
there
is
a
wicca
chaplain
that's
been
hired
by
the
department
of
corrections
in
wisconsin.
two
of
my
former
students,
who
are
upstanding
members
of
the
bar
in
every
respect,
are
asatrus,
so
that
these
are
matters
that
should
be
preserved
for
the
court
below.
this
court
has
made...
asked
many
questions
about
the
accommodation
of
religion,
and
the
suggestion
is,
well,
isn't
there
favoritism?
doesn't
it
encourage
favoritism
one
way
or
the
other?
but
the
answer
to
each
of
those
questions
is
the
same
with
respect
to
the
current
accommodations
already
provided
by
the
ohio
department
of
corrections
with
respect
to
mainstream
religions,
and
in
fact,
we
believe
on
remand,
we
will
be
able
to
show
that
there
is
a
preference
for
accommodating
mainstream
religions
as
opposed
to
non-mainstream
religions.
similarly,
there
has...
there
are...
there
have
been
questions
by
this
court
that...
that
the
standard
imposed
on
the
state
of
ohio
by
rluipa
is
this
particularly
difficult
or
tortuous
standard.
in
fact,
under
state
law
in
humphrey
v.
lane,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
the
state
of
ohio
supreme
court
has
already
imposed
a
similar
standard
with
regard
to
the
religious
accommodation
claims
of
prison
guards.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
i
understand
that
there
is
some
uncomfortable
feeling
about
the
nature
of
my
clients'
religion.
as
the
court
will
note
in
a...
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
it
has
been
reported
in
the
press
that
there
is
an
adherent
in
the
royal
navy
of
satanism,
and
the
royal
navy
has
agreed
that
if
he's
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
that
there
will
be
religious
rights
at
the
end
consistent
with
his
religion
and,
in
fact,
it
amounts
to
a
recognition
of
his
religion.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
i--
[laughter]
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
the
answer
is
yes
then.
it
is
a
non-mainstream
religion.
and
i
think
that
it's
important
for
us
to
assure
that
religious
groups
of
all
stripes
are...
are
accommodated
in
the...
in
the
context--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--i
believe
that
there
is...
it...
the
statute
is
pretty
clear
that
if
there
is
a...
if
it's
compelling
or
requiring
the
state
of
ohio
to
engage
in
an
unconstitutional
activity...
and
that
would
be
a
segregation
of
the
races...
that
there's
a
compelling
justification...
or
a
compelling
governmental
interest
in
not
complying
with
the
statute
or
saying
that
the
statute
does
not
apply
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
to
the
extent
that
there
is
bona
fide
religious
literature
that
is
racist,
there
are...
we
believe
that
the
constitution
permits
congress
or
any
legislative
body
to
accommodate
religion
in
isolation
from
other
religious
right--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--fundamental
rights.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
i
believe
they...
as
a
matter
of
course,
prison
officials
have
to
determine
whether
there's
a
good
faith
request
for
religious
accommodation
or
whether
the
person
is
trying
to
seek
something
under...
as
a
ruse.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
that's
correct.
but
to
let
me
finish
my...
my
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
if...
if
this
court
is
of
the
view...
or
members
of
this
court
are
of
the
view
that
it
would
be
content
discrimination,
for
example,
although
we
believe
that
you
can
accommodate
one
fundamental
right
separately
from
the
other
fundamental
rights,
then
of
course,
if
there
were
a
first
amendment
violation,
that
too
would
be
a
compelling
governmental
interest
in
justifying
refusal
to
apply
rluipa.
so
that
there
is
no
serious
problem
here.
and
in
fact,
there
is
no
reported
case
that
any
racist
literature
has
ever
been
permitted
in...
into
the
prisons
that
we've
been
able
to
find.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
that's--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--well,
as
i
say,
to
the
extent
that
that's
right,
if
there
were
content
discrimination
along
those
lines
and...
and
the
court
said
that
there
could
not
be...
it
was
the
court's
view
that
it
could
not
be
accommodated
for
religion
only,
then
of
course
the...
then
there
would
be
a
compelling
governmental
interest
in
avoiding
content
discrimination.
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
compelling
justification
of
dealing
with
inflammatory
literature,
i
don't
think
that's
in
dispute
in
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
first
of
all--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--well,
as...
as
i
read
amos,
amos
says
that
the
accommodation
of
religion
need
not
come--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--well,
it's
not...
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
different
for
constitutional
purposes,
that
if
there
is
a
differential
accommodation
which
the
court
concludes
violates
the
first
amendment
rights
of
someone
else
because
there's
content
discrimination,
i'm
not...
there
is
no
reason
to
treat
the
source
of
the
accommodation
as
dispositive.
it's
whether...
it
is
the
presence
of
the
accommodation
and
whether
it's
broad
enough
or
narrow
enough.
on
the
other
hand,
the...
we...
we
do
want
to
make
clear
that
there
are
numerous
accommodations
that
involve
first
amendment
rights
that
do
not
overlap
with...
with
religious
exercise
or
accommodation
of
religious
exercise.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
political
gatherings,
they're
not
entitled
under
the
first
amendment
to
the...
they're
not
accommodated
in
the
same
way
that
religious
congregations
in
prison
are
accommodated.
and
this
court
so
far
has
found
there
to
be
no
constitutional
violation
for
that
distinction.
and
to
the
extent
that
there's
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
there
is
little
doubt
that
the...
that
the
prison
officials
can
simply
say
no.
this...
we
will
not
accommodate
it.
we're
not
required
to
accommodate
it
under
the
statute.
the...
it
is
important
to
note,
that
the...
these
same
accommodations
are
routinely
granted
to
mainstream
religions
and
that
they
do
not
shift
burdens
to
third
parties.
there's
been
substantial
argument
that
there
is
a
substantial
shifting
of
burdens
to
third
parties.
in
fact,
where
third
party
claims
have
been
made
by
the
state
of
ohio
was
that
basically
that
the
cost
of
security
is
increased
because
now
it
takes
more...
or
the
cost
of
prison
administration
is
increased
because
it
takes
more
time
to
take
care
of
these
claims
and
requests
for
accommodation
than
there
would
be
if
they
didn't
have
to
attend
to
these--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--well,
the
argument
is
that
when,
for
example,
a
religious
accommodation
forces...
and...
and...
the
third
parties
to
chip
in,
as
they
had
to
do
in
caldor,
for
example,
private
third
parties,
that
that
renders
the
accommodation
unconstitutional.
and
the
state
has
been
arguing
that
the
lifting
of
burdens
on
the
religious
exercise
of
our
clients
makes
it
harder
for
their
prison
guards--
