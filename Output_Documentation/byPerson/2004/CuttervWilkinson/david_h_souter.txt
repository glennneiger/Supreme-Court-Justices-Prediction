justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
this...
this
question
because
it...
it...
i
think
it
goes
to
the...
the
heart
of
what
i
think
is
the
problem
in
this
case.
if
we
are
going
to
recognize
a
sphere
of
accommodation,
which
we
have
done
previously,
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
the...
that
the
object
of
accommodating
and
the
effect
of
accommodating
is,
in
one
sense,
to
benefit...
i
mean,
in
an
obvious
sense,
is
to
benefit
religion.
by
recognizing
a
sphere
of
accommodation,
in
effect,
i
think
the
court
has
said
there
is
a
sphere
in
which
religion
can
be
benefitted
that
does
not
rise
necessarily
to
the
level
of
government
proselytization
or...
or
government
endorsement.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
that
you're
making
is
that
if
the
government
endorses
at
all,
it's
immediately
in...
in
the...
the
realm
of
establishment.
am
i...
am
i
missing
something
in
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
and...
and
why
is
the
line
violated
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
i
think
you're
saying
that
in
order
to
exceed
what
free
exercise
requires
in
a
prison
necessarily
forces
you
into
establishment.
and
i
think
you're
saying
the
reason
it
does
so
is
that
there
are
so
many
incentives
on
the
part
of
prisoners
to
claim
religion,
that
that's
the
only
way
you
can
sort
of
keep
the
genie
in
the
bottle.
isn't
that
the...
the
essence
of
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it...
but...
but
that
is
not
what
the
rule
says.
number
one,
as...
as
your
brother
on
the
other
side
pointed
out,
there's
got
to
be
some
determination
made
as
a
threshold
matter
as
to
whether
this
is
even
a
religious
claim
or...
or
whether
it's
just
gaming
the
system.
so
there's
nothing
automatic.
number
two,
if
there
are,
as...
as
there
frequently
will
be,
in
the
prison
context
important
governmental
interests
which
can
only
be
served
by
denying
the...
the
request,
the
request
can
be
denied.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
these
are
not
sufficient
recognitions
of
the...
of
the
prison
context,
then
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
a
rule
we
can
have
that
would
satisfy
you
except
to
say
if
it
isn't
absolutely
required
by
free
exercise,
it
is
establishment.
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
mean
specific
accommodations
like
you
can
have
kosher
foods,
you
can
wear
a
religious
medal,
you
can
have
a
tatoo?
i
mean,
you're...
you're
asking
the
legislature
to
be
that
specific.
justice
david
h.
souter
it...
it
would
also
be
rather
a
discriminatory
one,
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
one...
one
point
that
we
have
got
to
be
concerned
about,
whether
we're
dealing
with
accommodation
or
whether
we're
dealing
with...
with
flat-out
establishment,
is
distinction
among
religions.
and
i
think
you're
saying
if
they
do
distinguish
among
religions,
we
don't
have
this
problem,
but
i
think
that
lands
you
from
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire.
justice
david
h.
souter
a
guy
comes
along
in
a
different
religion
and
says,
we're
omnivorous,
but
we
got
to...
we
got
to
wear
medals.
no
statute
that
says
medals
are
okay.
it...
it...
you
know,
i
realize
the
level
of
generality
in
your
example
is
higher.
the...
the
discrimination
is
not
quite
so
blatant,
but
it's
a
pretty
tough
job
to
come
up
with...
would
be
a
tough
job
to
come
up
with
statutes
without
picking
and
choosing
among
religious
demands.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
can't
they--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
why
can't
they
be
dealt
with
under
the
statute
as
it
is
written,
saying
that
if
you...
if
it
is
a
bona
fide
request,
and
you,
the
prison,
determine
that
in
fact
you...
you
have
a
compelling
state
interest
that
cannot
be
served
in
any
other
way,
you
can
say
no?
why
is
that
insufficient
and...
and
why
does
that...
why
is
that,
therefore,
the
reason
that...
that
jumps
us
into
an
establishment
clause
violation
every
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
saying
that...
that
a
statute
is
unconstitutional
to
recognize
a
prisoner's
right
to
free
exercise
unless
it
also
has
a...
a
kind
of
a
litany
of
sections
recognizing
speech
rights,
recognizing
privacy
rights,
et
cetera?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
it's
got
to
single
out
religion.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure
it
would.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
you
did
it
under
the
statute,
you
would
clearly
have
a
reason
for
saying
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
hasn't
that
been
the
effect
on
the
federal
ground.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'll...
i'll
grant
you
that,
but
it
seems
to...
i
mean,
justice
ginsburg
responded
to
that
by
saying
that
these
things
get
sorted
out.
at
the
beginning
you
get
all
sorts
of
loony
claims.
as
time
goes
by,
you
get
fewer
of
them.
and...
and
if...
if
they
weren't
getting
few
of
them,
i
would
have
expected
the
united
states
to
make
a
different
representation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
know
what
that's
got
to...
you
know,
you
may
or
may
not
have
an
argument
there,
but
i
don't
know
what
it's
got
to
do
with
the
meaning
of
the
establishment
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
better
shot
than...
better
shot
than
what?
better
shot
than
the...
than
the
free
exercise
clause
alone
would
allow?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
aren't
you
arguing
that
in
the
prison
context,
once
you
get
beyond
the
free
exercise
line,
you
are
into
establishment?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
how
do
we
administer?
how
does
anyone
administer
that...
that
kind
of
a
test?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
can...
it
can
be
better
but
not
much
better?
