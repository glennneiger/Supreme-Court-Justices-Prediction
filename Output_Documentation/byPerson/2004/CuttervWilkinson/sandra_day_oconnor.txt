and
yet,
it...
it
provides
an
unusual
framework
or
incentive,
if
you
will,
in
the
prison
context
to
get
religion.
if
you
can
find
some
religious
group
that
espouses
drinking
beer
every
day
or
other
alcoholic
beverages
or
taking
certain
amounts
of
marijuana
or
no
telling
what
or
having
certain
clothing
or
other
things
that
would
alter
the
conditions
of
the
prison
environment,
there's
a
real
incentive
here
to
get
religion.
[laughter]
and
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--federal
government
seems
to
be
trying
to
provide
those
incentives.
is
that
a
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the...
the
language
of
the
statute
is
pretty
strong:
unless
the
government
demonstrates
that
the
imposition
is
the
least
restrictive
means
and
in
furtherance
of
a
compelling
legislative
interest.
it
puts
quite
a
burden
on
the
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
i
think
it
was.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it...
does
the
statute
require
the
prison
officials
to
evaluate
the
bona
fides
of
the
particular
religion
that's
espoused?
isn't
one
of
the
groups
here
a
satanist
group?
so
the
religion...
the
bona
fides
of
the
group
have
to
be
reviewed
by
the
prison
authorities.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
don't
have
to
decide
it
here,
but
it's
looming.
and
when
it
goes
back,
if
it
does,
that
will
have
to
be
resolved
in
this
and
in
every
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
the
statute
appears
to
be
doing
is
to
try
to
go
back
to
the
pre-employment
division
v.
smith
case
standard
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
which
did
allow
for
accommodation
of
religion.
and
that
appears
to
be
what
this
statute
is
designed
to
do.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but...
but
before
employment
division
v.
smith,
wouldn't
we
have
had
the
same
question
arise
in
the
prison
context,
and
we
would
have
dealt
with
it
under
the
then-standards.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
had
the
court
ever
said
that
the
free
exercise
clause
couldn't
be
applied
in
the
prison
context?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
don't
you
address
the
ways
in
which
this
act
goes
beyond
our
former
free
exercise--
