justice
antonin
scalia
well,
rfra
didn't
involve
a...
a
limitation
to
situations
in
which
federal
funds
were
involved,
and
as
i
understand
this
statute
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
more
than
also.
i...
that
seems
to
me
the
principal
difference
between
this
and
rfra.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
i
don't
understand,
mr.
clement,
how
your
second
point
strengthens
your
first
point.
that
is
to
say,
if
we
disagree
with
your
first
point,
namely
that
the
institutionalized
persons
provisions
are
consistent
with
the
establishment
clause,
we
think
that
they
contradict
the
establishment
clause,
they
couldn't
possibly
be
saved
by
your
second
point.
can
you
require
as
a...
as
a
condition
of...
under
the
spending
clause
that
a
state
violate
the
establishment
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
satanism
a
non-mainstream
religion?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
it?
the
royal
navy
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
our
royal
navy?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm...
i'm
sorry.
you've
lost
me.
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
about
shifting
burdens
to
third
parties.
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cole,
are
you
sure
that
this
statute
doesn't
go
beyond
pre-smith...
our
pre-smith
law?
i'm
not
aware
that
our
pre-smith
law
would
have
defined
religious
exercise
as
broadly
as
this
statute
defines
it.
i
guess
this
is
something
mr.
clement
ought
to
speak
to
as
well.
it
says,
the
term
religious
exercise
includes
any
exercise
of
religion
whether
or
not
compelled
by
or
central
to
a
system
of
religious
belief.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
our
prior
smith
cases
go
that
far?
i'm
not
aware
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
don't
even
have
to
say
my...
my
religion
requires
me
not
to
eat
this
food.
they
just
say,
you
know,
i'm--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think...
i
think
you
may
exaggerate
what
it
takes
to
establish
a
compelling
state
interest.
i
mean,
we...
this...
this
court
held
in
the...
in
the
pre-smith
days
that
it
was
a
compelling
state
interest
to...
to
prevent
members
of
the
air
force
from
wearing
yarmulkes.
i
mean,
if
that's
a
compelling
state
interest,
i
think
it's
pretty
easy
to
get
most
anything
declared
a...
a
compelling
state
interest
under
this
statute,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
goes
beyond
pre-smith
too,
doesn't
it?
least
restrictive
alternative.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they're
not
burdening
you
anyway...
anyway.
just
don't
take
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
comes
with
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
the
burden?
don't
take
the
money.
i
mean,
they...
they
do
that
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
we
have
before
us
in
this
case
is...
is
a
case
covered
by
the...
the
spending
clause.
so
we
don't
have
to
grapple
with
the
commerce
clause
for
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it...
why
is
it
worse
for...
for
judges
to
be
overseers
of
religious
life
in
prison
than
it
is
for
wardens
to
be
overseers
of
religious
life
in
prison?
i
mean,
somebody
has
to
say
what
the
lines
are,
what
will...
what
will
be
accommodated
and
what
won't.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
someone
is
going
to
be
a
government
official.
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
wardens
are...
are
better
at
it
than
judges
except
with
respect
to,
you
know,
security
and
administrative
convenience,
which
we
will
honor
under
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
think
that
means
that
they
will
give
great
deference
to
what
the...
what
the
wardens
of
the
prisons
say
is
a
compelling
interest
of...
of
the
penal
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
also
not
compelled...
not
compelled...
by
religion.
you
just
say,
you
know,
i...
i
want
to
give
up
everything
except
candy
for
lent,
and
the...
the
prison
has
to
accommodate
you.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
compelled.
i...
you
know,
i
could
do
something
else.
but
i
had
thought
that
our
prior
religion
cases
did...
did,
indeed,
require
some
religious
compulsion
than
just
i...
you
know,
i'd
like
to
do
this
as
a
religious
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
you're
right.
i
think
i
was
thinking
of
free
exercise
cases
rather
than
establishment
cases.
