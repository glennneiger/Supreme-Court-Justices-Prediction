justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
maybe
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
your
argument
in
response
to
justice
souter?
you
said
it
is
not
the
following.
it
is
not
that
the
state
has
to
list,
along
with
these
religious
matters,
the
second
amendment,
the
first
amendment,
et
cetera.
it's
not
that.
you
then
seem
to
say
that
the
argument
is
that
a
person
who
files
a
piece
of
paper
and
claims
to
be
religious,
that
they
have
to
consider
it,
and
it's
impelled
only
by
religion.
i
suppose
the
same
thing
is
true
of
a
church
that
applies
for
a
tax
exemption.
so
i
don't
think
that
you
could
say
that
automatically
that
fact
that
they're
going
to
give
the
church
a
tax
exemption
or
that
they're
going
to
give
the
religious
person
some
special
consideration,
that
that
in
and
of
itself
violates
the
establishment
clause.
very
well.
what
does?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
but
i
just
need
to
know
where
you're
going--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--generally.
i
don't
need
a
bright
line
rule.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
it
is
about
this
that
violates
the
clause
if
it
isn't
the
first
thing
or
the
second
thing
that
i
mentioned.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
now,
in
respect
to
that,
we
have
two
points.
one
was
justice
o'connor's
i
think,
which
is
that
congress
is
not
enlarging
it,
but
for
my
second
qualification,
beyond
what
it
would
have
been
if
smith
had
never
been
decided.
and
the
second
is
justice
scalia's
point,
which
is
but
there
is
one
respect
in
which
congress
did
enlarge
it,
namely,
that
the
right
doesn't
have...
the
belief
doesn't
have
to
be
central.
it
could
be...
well,
he
just
read
that.
so
is
your
whole
argument
then
pinned
on
that
latter
point?
and
if
it
is
not,
again,
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
if
turner
had
come
up
prior
to
smith,
the
court
would
have
said
that
turner
trumps
pre-smith
law,
and
you
don't
have
to
follow
pre-smith
law
in
the
prison.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
i...
i
understand
the
argument
now,
which
has
been
helpful.
very
well.
from
the
prison's
point
of
view,
why
is
it
so
burdensome
since
you
would
have
thought
security
is
a
compelling
interest,
prison
administration
is
a
compelling
interest,
so
that
really
all
we
have
to
do
is
think
about
this
and
look
to
see
whether
there
isn't
some
reasonable
way
of
accommodating
the
request?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
true.
now
there
you're
in
the
dilemma.
i
mean,
you're
putting
yourself
there
in
the
same
position
that
virtually
every
official
is
in
in
the
united
states
but
for
judges
who
have...
who
have
to
worry
about
the
court
of
appeals.
but
anyway,
the...
the--
[laughter]
you
see...
now,
the
answer
to
that
argument
in
your
case,
you're
in
a
vice.
they
put
you
in
a...
in
a
kind
of
pincers
because
where
you
have
a
good
argument,
they
say,
well,
that
doesn't
violate
the
statute,
and
where
your
claim
is
weak,
they
say,
well,
it
shouldn't
be
a...
it
should
violate
the
statute.
and
the
difficulty
with
being
in
pincers
like
that
is
you
can't
win.
and
the
virtue
of
it
is
you
shouldn't
win.
all
right.
so...
so
how
do
you
get
out
of
this...
of
the...
of
that
kind
of
an
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but...
your
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
american
indian
who
didn't...
or
was
it...
i
think
it
was
an
american
indian.
but...
who
didn't
want
to
be
known...
it
was
a
woman
and
she
didn't
want
to
known
as
a
number.
she
wanted
a
name.
that
was
a
religious
basis.
and
social
security...
i
think
the
court
hold...
didn't
have
to
give
her
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
to
me
stood
for
the
proposition
that
administrative
considerations
play
an
important
role
in
deciding
whether
you've
hit
upon
the
least
restrictive
alternative.
and
as
long
as
that
was
the
law,
then
you're
okay.
and
that
was
a
supreme
court
case
i
think.
i
may
be
misremembering.
