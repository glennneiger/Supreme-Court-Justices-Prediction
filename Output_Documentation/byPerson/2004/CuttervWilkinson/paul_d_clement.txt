mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
government
acts
to
remove
government-imposed
burdens
on
religious
exercise,
it
does
not
violate
the
establishment
clause.
rather,
as
this
court
put
the
point
in
zorach
against
clauson,
when
the
government
eases
those
kind
of
burdens,
it
follows
the
best
of
our
traditions.
the
religious
land
use
and
institutionalized
persons
act,
or
rluipa,
eases
government
burdens
on
restrictions
by
having
institutions
and
prison
officials
examine
burdens
on
religious
exercise
and
remove
unjustified,
substantial
burdens.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
that...
that
that
doesn't
make
any
substantial
difference,
in
part,
i
think
because
if
you
think
about
certainly
this
application
of
rluipa,
it's
spending
clause
legislation.
and
spending
legislation
often
takes
the
form
of
giving
the
states
an
incentive
to
take
action
on
their
own.
and
in
this
sense,
i
think
you
can
understand
this
legislation
as
giving
the
states
an
opportunity
to
remove
their
own
burdens
on
religious
exercise.
and
that's
precisely
how
it
works
in
practice.
the
relevant
action
that
a
state
takes
is
state
action
removing
its
own
burdens,
not
federal
action
imposed
on
the
states.
and
i
think
that's
consistent
with
the
analysis
of
this
court
in
the
dole
case
where
the
federal
government,
on
the
assumption
of
this
court,
didn't
have
the
direct
power
under
the
21st
amendment
to
raise
the
drinking
age,
but
it
could
give
the
option
to
the
states
to
exercise
their
power
to
do
it.
so
i
do
think
in
the
end,
the
burdens
that
are
removed
here
are
attributable
to
the
state
of
ohio,
not
to
the
federal
government.
it
is
also
true
that
the
standard
that's
imposed
by
rluipa
is
a
more
exacting
standard
than
that
imposed
by
the
federal
constitution
itself.
but
i
don't
think
providing
for
greater
accommodation
of
religious
exercise
than
the
federal
constitution
creates
an
establishment
clause
problem.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
don't
think
this
case
poses
the
same
problems
as
city
of
boerne.
first
of
all,
this
really
isn't
an
effort
to
rewrite
a
rule
of
decision
for
all
cases
the
way
that
rfra
was.
congress
in
this
legislation
targeted
two
areas
where
there
were
particular
problems
with
respect
to
religious
exercise,
and
in
those
contexts,
it
addressed
a
different
standard.
now,
as
i
say,
that
standard
is
higher,
but
so
are
the
standards
of
over
half
of
the
states
which
also
apply
a
heightened
scrutiny
test
either
as
a
matter
of
state
constitutional
law
or
state
law.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
is
also
true.
i
mean,
there...
there
is...
to
be
sure
there
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
take
your
point,
justice
scalia.
i
would...
i
would
clarify
that
there
is
the
potential
for
applications
to
the
statute
under
the
commerce
clause.
we
don't
think
that's
really
appropriately
presented
here.
we
also
think
that
with
respect
to
state
prisons
in
all
their
applications,
they
will
be
spending
clause
applications.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
the
fact
that
there
may
be
more
than
one
hook
for
this
legislation
in
certain
applications
shouldn't
make
any
constitutional
difference.
and
i
think
here
it
is
spending
clause
legislation
as
it
applies
to
the
state
of
ohio.
i
think
that's
conceded.
they...
they
take
issue
with
whether
it's
valid.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
there's
money
involved
makes
it
harder
or
easier
from
a
spending
clause
perspective.
i
think
from
the
perspective
of
why
this
case
is
different
from
boerne,
the
fact
that
it's
spending
clause
and
commerce
clause
and
not
section
5
legislation
makes
a
big
difference.
but
i
certainly
don't
want
to
leave
you
with
the
impression
that
there's
anything
constitutionally
problematic
because
there's
federal
money
involved
because,
of
course,
this
court
has
upheld
federal
spending
clause
legislation
in
religion
areas
in
cases
like
zobrest,
mergens,
agostini,
mitchell
against
helms.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
don't,
justice
stevens.
or
another
way
of
answering
that
is
i
would
say
that
even
though
you
thought
there
was
an
establishment
clause
problem
in
the
city
of
boerne
case,
i
don't
think
you
need
to
find
one
here.
and
part
of
that
is
because
this
is
more
targeted
legislation,
and
it
particularly
deals,
as...
as
it
comes
to
this
court
in
this
application,
with
the
exercise
of
religion
in
prisons.
and
i
think
that's
an
area
like
the
military
where
the
government
is
necessarily
going
to
be
involved
with
religion
in
a
way
that
it
otherwise
wouldn't
be.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
o'connor--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
upon
analysis
it
is,
and
i
think
there's
a
couple
of
reasons
why
that's
so.
first
of
all,
this
is
not
an
absolute
entitlement
to
get
your
religious
beer
at
5:00
p.m.
every
day.
it
is
a
balancing
test,
and
i
think
things
like
getting
beer
every
day,
getting
marijuana
inside
prison
walls
would
not
satisfy
the
test.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it
does,
justice
o'connor,
but
just
to
take
a
step
back,
i
mean,
applying
that
same
standard
in
the
smith
case,
you
yourself
thought
that
a
general
law
banning
marijuana
use
outside
or...
or
peyote
use
outside--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--peyote
outside
of
prison
would
be
justified
even
under
that
standard.
i
would
think,
a
fortiori,
it
would
be
justified
within
prison
walls.
i
want
to
make
another
point
about
the
incentives,
though,
which
i
think
is
important.
every
state
in
the
union
provides
some
degree
of
accommodation
for
religion,
and
in
many
states
it's
majoritarian
religions
that
are
accommodated.
now,
if
there's
going
be
some
incentive
to
engage
in
religiosity
in
prison
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
things
offered
for
religion
that
aren't
available
for
something
else,
at
least
rluipa
has
the
virtue
of
making
sure
that
all
religions
are
accommodated
neutrally.
so
if
there's
any
incentive,
it's
an
incentive
for
religion
over
irreligion
as
opposed
to
between
sects...
sects
of
religions,
and
i
think
that's
the
way
you
would
have
without
rluipa
involved.
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
is
although
there
may
be
some
extravagant
claims
of
certain
religions
that
would
seem
quite
enticing,
much
religious
exercise
in
many
of
the
reported
cases
involve
things
that
i
don't
think
people
are
necessarily
lining
up
to
do.
i
mean,
there
are
a
number
of
lower
court
cases
dealing
with
the
availability
of
kosher
food,
and
in
prison
what
that
means
as
a
practical
matter,
is
generally
you
are
going
to
get
cold
food
rather
than
hot
food.
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think...
and
we
cite
a
few
cases
in
footnote
2
of
our
reply
brief
that
suggest
that
in
dealing
with
legitimate
concerns
about
using
prison...
religious
symbols
or
other
religious
items
as
a
gang
signifier
or
a
gang
identifier,
that
the...
that
there
have
been
cases
where
the
courts,
even
applying
the
heightened
standard
or
rluipa
or
rfra,
have
deferred
to
the
government
officials.
i
also
think,
though,
it's
worth
noting
how
the
federal
government
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
dealt
with
the
concern
that
religious
medallions,
as
opposed
to
beards,
would
be
used
for
gang
identification
or
gang
signification.
ohio,
i
take
it,
takes
the
position
that
if
you
have
a
medallion
that
could
be
used
for
those
purposes,
you
can't
have
it
within
prison
walls
at
all.
the
bureau
of
prisons,
by
contrast,
takes
the
position
that
you
can
have
the
medallion,
but
you
have
to
wear
it
inside
your
shirt.
so
it
can't
be
used
for
prison
signification
purposes
or
gang
identification
purposes.
and
i
think
that
shows
the
kind
of
reasonable
accommodation
that
rluipa
or
rfra,
as
it
applies
to
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
in
a
case
like
that...
i
mean,
obviously,
this
court's
recent
decision
in
johnson
would
suggest
that...
that
the
prison
officials
are
in
a
difficult
position
there
and
i
think
they
could
not
accede
to
that
request.
and
i
think
complying
with
the
equal
protection
clause
in
that
context
would
itself
be
a
compelling
interest
under
the
statute.
and
i
think
this
court
in
widmar
against
vincent,
for
example,
suggested
that
avoiding
establishment
clause
problems
is
a
sufficient
compelling
interest.
i
would
think
equally
avoiding
the
equal
protection
clause
violation
in
that
context
would
also
be
a
compelling
interest,
and
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
least
restrictive
alternative.
and
so
i
think
that
the
statute...
there
would
be
no
statutory
violation
in
refusing
that
particular
accommodation.
i
think
there...
these
show
that
there
are
ways
to
administer
this
statute
in
a
way
that's
respectful
of
the
decisions
of
local
prison
officials
but
also
does
make
sure
that
they
have
a
degree
of
sensitivity
to
these
claims
for
religious
exercise.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
o'connor,
no
more
so
than
under
the
free...
the
free
exercise
clause
itself.
i
mean...
and
as
this
case,
of
course,
comes
to
this
court,
the
substantiality
of
the
religious
beliefs
and
that
they
are
actually
held
by
these
individuals
has
been
stipulated
to.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right,
justice
o'connor,
but
that's
true
under
the
free
exercise
clause
as
well.
so
even
the
sixth
circuit,
that
obviously
had
some
problems
with
the
statute,
understood
that
on
that
score
there's
no
more
entanglement
with
religion
under
rluipa
than
there
is
under
the
free
exercise
clause
itself.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
this
court
has
been
clear
in
the
context
of
legislative
accommodations
of
religion
in
particular
to
make
clear
that
that
preference
of
religion
over
irreligion
doesn't
mean
that
the
government
cannot
provide
legislative
accommodations
of
religion
without
providing
benefits
for
secular
organizations
as
well.
that
was
the
clear
holding
of
this
court
in
amos.
and
i
think
that
although
this
court
has
expressed
concerns
about
religious
accommodations
when
there's
no
guarantee
that
the
religious
accommodation
will
be
provided
to
other
sects...
take,
for
example,
the
kiryas
joel
case.
this
court
has
been
quite
clear
that
there
is
not
a
constitutional
problem
in
favoring
religion
over
irreligion
in
providing
legislative
accommodations
for
religion.
and
as
i
said,
in...
in
zorach
against
clauson,
this
court
noted
that
that's
not
just
the
absence
of
a
constitutional
problem,
but
there's
really
a
constitutional
virtue
in
the
legislature
acting
to
accommodate
religion.
the
court
made
basically
the
same
point
in
smith
in
saying
that
even
though
the
free
exercise
clause
did
not
require
the
special
accommodation
or
exemption
for
peyote,
the
legislatures
could
do
so
and
in
doing
so,
they
would
be
furthering
constitutional
values.
if
i
could
say
a
few
words
about
the
spending
clause
claim
that
is
brought
by
ohio
in
this
case.
they
suggest
that
there's
a
difficulty
with
this
legislation
under
the
spending
clause.
now,
the
court
below--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
it
is
not
in
the
questions
presented
themselves,
i
don't
think,
but
i
think
it
would
be
fairly
open
to
this
court
to
reach
it
because
it
would
be
an
alternative
ground
to
support
the
judgment
below.
that
said,
this
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
it
and
its
practice
in
recent
cases
has
been
when
there's
one
constitutional
claim
that
is...
that
the
court
has
ruled
on
below,
it
doesn't
necessarily
reach
the
other...
the
other
constitutional
claims.
the
court
did
that
in
cases
like
oakland
cannabis
and
the
pierce
county
case.
and
we
would
urge
the
same
course
here
because,
although
the
courts
have
divided
on
this
establishment
clause
issue,
the
courts
have
not
divided
on
the
spending
clause
issue.
all
the
courts
that
have
reached
it
have
upheld
it
as
valid
spending
clause
legislation.
and
i
think
that
reflects
the
fact
that
there
is
a
clear
nexus
here
between
the
federal
funds
and
the
federal
conditions
that
are
being
imposed.
if
the
federal
government
is
going
to
provide
money,
over
$1
million
to
ohio,
to
have
prisoner
meals,
then
certainly
the
federal
government
can
insist
that
kosher
meals
are
among
the
available
options.
and
so
too
if
the...
if
the
federal
government
is
going
to
provide
monies
for
ohio
to
build
prisons,
they
can
ensure
that
those
prisons
are
safe
and
are
operated
consistent
with
federal
policy
such
that
there's
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
or
religion.
the
last
issue
in
the
case,
of
course,
is
the
commerce
clause
issue,
and
on
that
issue,
no
court
below
reached
the
issue.
and
we
think
this
court's
recent
admonition
in
the
sabri
case
that
facial
challenges
are
best
when
infrequent,
applies
with
particular
force
here
because--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
of
course
not,
justice
scalia,
and
i
must
have
misspoke.
my
point
is
they
raise
three
arguments
that
are
all
alternative
arguments
to
support
the
judgment
below.
my
burden
is
to
defeat
all
three
of
them
to
show...
if
the
court
reaches
them.
so
i
have
to
show
that
there's
no
establishment
clause
violation,
which
we...
we've
certainly
made
that
argument
in
the
brief
and
here
today,
and
that
there's
no
spending
clause
violation,
and
that
there's
no
commerce
clause
violation.
the...
in
this
case
the
commerce
clause
claim
has
a
completely
abstract
quality,
and
indeed,
the
only
temptation
to
reach
the
issue
at
all
would
be
that
the...
since
rluipa
has
a
jurisdictional
element,
the
resolution
of
the
commerce
clause
is
so
clear
that
it
might
be
tempting
to
reach
it.
but
i
think
the
better
course
would
be
for
this
court
to
allow
that
issue
to
be
sorted
out
in
the...
in
the
lower
courts.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
note
the
anomaly
that
much
of
the
argument
of
general
cole
would
be
an
argument
for
why
the
state
constitutional
provision
that
gives
higher
protection
for
freedom
of
conscience
in
ohio
is
itself
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'd
be
happy
to
do
that,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
there's
been
an
exaggeration
of
how
far
it
goes
beyond.
now,
i
want
to
be
clear
about
one
thing,
which
is
this
court,
even
before
smith
and
o'lone,
said
that
there
was
going
to
be
deference
to
prison
officials
and
a
turner
standard
would
apply.
so
to
the
extent
that
there's
a
little
less
deference
here
than
under
the
o'lone
standard,
that
is
a
modification.
the
centrality
requirement,
though,
is
not
something
that
can
be
charged
to
rluipa
or
to
rfra
because
even
before
the
smith
case,
this
court
in
ling
and
hernandez
was
moving
away
from
centrality
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
in
its
accommodations
cases
held
that
the
government
can
only
accommodate
those
things
that
are
central.
i
don't
know
for
sure,
but
i
rather
doubt
that
employing
co-religionists
in
a
gymnasium
is
central
to
the
practice
of
any
faith.
yet,
in
amos,
this
court
upheld
that
as
a
valid
accommodation.
and
i
do
think
the
centrality
requirement--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what's
that?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
again...
but...
but
to
the
extent
i
do,
i
think
those
are
questions
that
are
best
to
be
kept
out
of
the
courts,
which
is
why
even
before
smith
this
court
moved
away
from
centrality.
it's
why
even
justice
o'connor,
who
otherwise
was
in
disagreement
in
smith,
also
agreed
that
we
should
get
rid
of
the
centrality
requirement.
and
if
you
look
at
some
of
the
cases
that
are
actually
decided
under
rluipa,
the
cases
involve
things
like
muslim
prayer
oil
and
they...
the
cases...
the
seventh
circuit,
for
example,
allows
it.
now,
we
don't
want
the
courts
getting
into--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i...
i
think
that's
right,
and
i
think
there
is
not
that
centrality
requirement
for
accommodations.
i
do
want
to
make
the
point,
though,
that...
that
ohio
already,
under
its
state
constitution,
has
this
heightened
review
with
a
lot
of
these,
you
know,
least
restrictive
alternative
tests
and
the
like.
nobody
thinks
ohio's
constitution
violates
the
federal
constitution.
that's
true
even
though
ohio
applies
it
in
the
prison
context,
at
least
when
it's
a
claim
by
a
guard
rather
than
an
inmate.
that...
those
are
the
facts
of
humphrey
against
lane.
it's
also
true
that
many
of
ohio's
arguments
would
suggest
their
own
accommodations
of
some
religions
give
too
much
of
an
incentive
for
religious
exercise
and
the
like.
and
i
think
that's
a
defect
as
well.
i
don't
think...
and
i
agree
with
justice
souter
in
this
regard...
that
narrower
accommodations
actually
raise
more
constitutional
problems
than
broader
accommodations.
i
think
that
this
court,
for
example,
in
caldor
dealt
with
an
accommodation
that
was
at
a
fairly
high
level
of
generality,
but
yet
this
court
said
and
justice
o'connor
emphasized
in
her
concurrence,
well,
that's
a
preference
for
sabbatarian
religions.
and
i
think
you
avoid
that
with
this
kind
of
across-the-board
test.
justice
kennedy,
you
made
a
point
about
whether
this
is
extreme
in
the
degree
that
it
accommodates
religion,
but
it's
certainly
no
more
extreme
than
the...
than
the
laws
and
constitutions
of
26
states,
which
across
the
board
apply
this
heightened
scrutiny
to
all
manner
of
state
actions.
so
in
that
sense,
the
fact
that
it
accommodates
religion
kind
of
wholesale
with
a
broader
standard,
as
opposed
to
retail,
i
don't
think
is
a
constitutional
defect.
the
last
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
on
the
racist
literature
hypothetical,
and
i
think
it
is
in
large
measure
just
a
hypothetical.
as
footnote
2
in
our
brief
points
out,
prisons
have
been
generally
successful
in
keeping
racist
literature
out
even
when
it's
supported
as
a
claim
for
religious-based
racist
literature.
the
only
cases
that
i've
come
across
where
that
hasn't
prevailed
is
when
the...
the
prison's
own
policy
had
exceptions
in
it
that
made
very
little
sense.
and
in
this
case,
for
example,
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix
page
118,
there's
an
allegation
that
with...
with
one
piece
of
literature
that
was
described
as
racist,
that
some
prisoners
were
allowed
to
have
it
while
others
were
not
allowed
to
have
that
same
kind
of
literature.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
those
claims
are
in
fact
true,
but
that's
the
kind
of
claim
that
should
be
able
to
go
forward
in
a
case
like
this.
with
all
respect,
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
here
made
a
mistake,
ignored
this
court's
precedents,
and
should
be
reversed.
