mr.
george
s.
lemieux
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
experienced
counsel
thoroughly
investigates,
prepares
for
trial,
and
discusses
his
trial
strategy
with
his
client,
a
challenge
for
effectiveness
may
not
presume
prejudice.
rather,
this
court's
two-part
inquiry,
articulated
in
strickland
v.
washington,
is
the
proper
measure.
the
florida
supreme
court
erred
in
its
decision
below
for
three
main
reasons.
first,
they
failed
to
apply
strickland's
two-part
circumstance-specific,
performance
prejudice
inquiry
to
a
question
of
trial
strategy.
second,
it
improperly
presumed
prejudice
under
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
cronic
where
there
was
neither
a
complete
denial
of
counsel,
nor
did
counsel
entirely
fail
to
subject
the
state's
case
to
meaningful
adversarial
testing.
third,
the
florida
supreme
court
improperly
expanded
this
court's
decision
in
boykin
v.
alabama
from
governing
pleas
of
guilt
to
governing
tactical
decisions
made
during
full-fledged
trials.
for
these
three
reasons
and
because
the
florida
court's
decision
conflicts
with
strickland
and
its
progeny
and
will
disrupt
the
effective
administration
of
justice,
we
request
reversal.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
no,
justice
o'connor,
it
was
not.
mr.
corin,
after
speaking
to
his
client
on
three
occasions
about
this
trial
strategy,
sought
to
concede
the
underlying...
the
underlying
crimes
but
to
argue
what
was
the
most
essential
part
of
this
case,
and
that
was
whether
or
not
death
should
be
the
outcome
of
the
jury.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
it
was
not,
your
honor,
because
a
guilty
plea,
as
this
court
talked
about
in
boykin
v.
alabama,
gives
up
rights
of
the
defendant.
the
lawyer
and
the
defendant
waive
rights.
they
waive
the
right
to
trial.
they
waive
the
right
to
have
the
state
prove
their
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
they
waive
the
right
to
have
a
jury,
to
confront
witnesses,
to
cross
examine,
all
of
the
attendant
trial
rights.
mr.
nixon--
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
--there
was
some
cross
examination,
not
a
lot.
there
was
cross
examination
of
one
of
mr.
nixon's
uncles,
who
was
one
of
the
seven
confessions
in
this
case,
and
we
don't
know
specifically
why
mr.
corin
engaged
in
that
cross
examination.
it
could
be
because
that
was
probably
the
weakest
of
the
seven
confessions
and
perhaps
he
wanted
the
jury
to
hear
that
that
confession
was
weak.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
yes,
there
was,
justice
scalia.
in
fact,
you
know,
mr.
nixon
was...
was
very
much
engaged
in
the
guilt
phase
of
this
trial.
he
objected
to
the
introduction
of
evidence.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
mr.
nixon
was
in
the
courtroom
for
portions
of
the
trial.
he
was
in--
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
--mr.
nixon
was
not
in
the
courtroom
for
the
opening
statement
or
the
closing
statement.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
he
was
there
during
some
of
voir
dire.
he
was
there
after
the
opening
statement
when
two
witnesses
testified,
one
who
testified
that
he
was
the
person
who
tried
to
sell
the
victim's
car
and
positively
identified
him
in
the
courtroom,
and
another
when
the
sheriff's
deputy
positively
identified
him
as
the
person
who
confessed
and
gave
the
45-minute
confession
and
the
person
he
arrested.
after
those
two
witnesses
testified,
mr.
nixon
then
decided
to
leave
the
courtroom
on
that
occasion.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
your...
your
honor,
none
of
that
evidence
has
been
presented
in
any
of
the
post-conviction
proceedings,
and
while
it's
creative,
i
think
it's
not
before
this
court
because
it's
never
been
entered
into
evidence.
it's
just
speculation.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
it
is,
your
honor.
both
questions
are
before
you.
i...
i
believe
that--
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
--what
the
florida
supreme
court
did
is
they
found
that
since
this
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea,
if
there
was
not
explicit
and
affirmative
consent,
that
cronic
would
apply
and
a
presumption
of
prejudice
would
follow.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
the...
the
only
thing
that
they
do
say,
your
honor,
is
that
they
say
that
the
strategy
employed
by
mr.
corin
may
well
have
been
in
mr.
nixon's
best
interests.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
your
honor,
there
were
three
hearings
in
the
post-conviction
proceedings,
and
the...
the
defense,
who
had
the
burden
in
those
cases
to
prove
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
only
put
on
mr.
corin
and
the
state
cross
examined
mr.
corin
and
called
some
other
witnesses.
i
don't
know
what
further
evidence
could
be
adduced
that
would
go
to
a
separate
claim.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
i
think
that
this
court
could
engage
in
that.
i
think
you
could
remand
and
have
the
florida
supreme
court
engage
in
that.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
they
have
not
because
the
florida
supreme
court
ruled
under
cronic.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
yes,
your
honor.
three
trial
court
judges
all
found
that
there
was
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
judge
hall,
who
presided
over
the
trial,
in
fact,
described
mr.
corin's
advocacy
as
being
right
on
the
mark.
he
found
in
his
approach
an
excellent
analysis
of
the
realities
of
the
case
and
the
preservation
of
credibility
and
the
credibility
of
any
mitigating
circumstances.
he
also
found
that
it
was
perhaps
the
only
steps
that
could
have
been
taken
to
afford
his
client
some
relief.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
sure,
sure.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
your
honor,
i
think
that
brookhart
in
fact
probably
supports
our
position
because
in
brookhart
the
situation
was
factually
different.
it
was
more
of
a...
a
guilty
plea
situation
where
there
was
going
to
be
this
prima
facie
trial,
which
was,
in
essence,
a
guilty
plea
with
a
profferer
through
one
witness.
and
in
that
case,
the
defendant
stood
up
and
said,
i
want
a
trial,
i
want
everyone
to
understand
i'm
not
pleading
guilty.
and
this
court
said
that
counsel
can't
waive
those
rights
to
a
full
trial
when
the
defendant
is
objecting
to
it,
but
if
the
defendant
consents
or
acquiesces,
this
court
said
the
ruling
would
be
different.
well,
certainly
mr.
nixon
at
least
acquiesced.
mr.
corin
spoke
to
him
on
three
occasions...
and
that
can
be
found
at
255
of
the
joint
appendix...
and
talked
to
him
about
this
strategy.
mr.
nixon
never
responded
either
way
as
to
his
assent
or
what
he
wanted
to
be
done.
now,
judge
ferris,
who
was
the
third
trial
court
judge
who
heard
this
matter,
said
that
because
of
the
longstanding
relationship
between
this
defendant
and
this
lawyer,
because
he
had
represented
him
three
times
before
over
a
2-year
period,
that
there
was
a
level
of
relationship,
they
were
both
veterans
of
the
criminal
justice
system,
they
had
a
rapport
with
each
other.
and
she
was
able
to
determine
that
there
was
consent
to
the
trial
strategy
in
the
fact
that
mr.
nixon
did
not
object
to
it.
the
florida
supreme
court
wants
explicit
and
affirmative
consent,
and
they
want
a
colloquy
on
the
record.
and
we
think
that
this
will
be
very
problematic,
and
we're
already
seeing
these
problems
in
florida.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
in
terms
of
a
trial
strategy,
your
honor?
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
your
honor,
i
think
you
do
and
i
think
that
boykin
addresses
that
there
has
to
be
a
colloquy
with
a
plea
of
guilty,
and
that
the...
the
defendant
can't
tacitly
consent
to
a
plea
of
guilty.
but
our
position
is
that
this
is
not
a
plea
of
guilty.
this
is
not
a
complete
surrender.
this
is
a
tactical
retreat
made
for
reasons
of
trying
to
contest
the
one
issue
in
this
case
that
could
be
contested,
and
that
was
trying
to
save
this
defendant's
life.
this
lawyer
took
52
depositions.
he
hired
medical
professionals.
he
investigated
mr.
nixon's
background,
going
back
to
the
age
of
10.
he
did
everything--
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
--they
were
admitted
over
his
objection,
and
that
was
taken
up
on
direct
appeal
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
and
the
florida
supreme
court,
in
nixon
i,
did
not
find
that
they
were
inflammatory
and
found
that
their
introduction
was
proper.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
they
were
already
in
evidence
and
the
state
incorporated
its
evidence
from
the
guilt
phase
into
the
sentencing
phase.
it's
just
a
procedure.
the
only
evidence
that
the
state
put
on
in
the
guilt
phase
were
his
prior
two
convictions
and
evidence
that
mr.
nixon
tortured
the
defendant
by
removing
her
underwear
before
he
burned
her
alive.
besides
that,
the
rest
of
the
evidence
was
incorporated
from
the
guilt
phase.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
it
may...
it
may
have
been
but
it
would
be
something
that
would
be
evaluated
under
strickland,
justice
stevens.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
i
think
the
only
point
i
would
make
there
is
this
court
said
in
strickland
that
counsel
should
consult
with
their...
with
their
client,
with
the
accused,
and
that
that's
an
obligation
on
counsel.
if
there
was
a
failure
to
consult,
perhaps
that
would
be
argued
that
that
failure
to
consult
was
deficient
performance.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
yes,
justice
souter,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that
there
could
be
meaningful
discussions
between
the
defendant
and
the
accused
that
can
help
the
lawyer
represent
the
defendant
at
trial.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
that's
what
the
court
speaks
about
in
brookhart,
and
although
we
think
that
that's
more
of
a
guilty
plea
case
than
a
trial
strategy
case,
if
this
court
were
to
go
in
that
direction,
that
standard
certainly
could
apply.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
in...
i
think
this
court
has
held
in
cases
like
jones
v.
barnes
and
taylor
v.
illinois,
that
questions
of
strategy
are
questions
that
are
reserved
to
the
lawyer,
and
that
all--
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
--we--
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
--we...
we
agree
with
that
position,
justice
stevens.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
your
honor,
it's
not
our
position
that
you
should
a
rule
of
consent.
i
was
saying
if
this
court
were
going
in
that
direction,
that
the
acquiescence
level
would
be
what
we
would
suggest.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
your
honor,
florida
does
have
a
rule
for
a
guilty
plea,
but...
and
now
the
florida
supreme
court
says
there
has
to
be
a
colloquy
for
a
strategy
decision
that...
where
there's
a
concession,
but
we
disagree
with
that.
we
don't
think
that
there
should
be
a
colloquy.
we
don't
think
that
that...
that
should
be
required.
and
we
think
that
that's
problematic
and
we're
already
seeing
in
florida
that...
that
judges,
laboring
under
the
nixon
decision,
are
asking
questions
to
defendants
as
to
whether
or
not
all
sorts
of
strategy
decisions
are
decisions
they
agreed
to.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
well...
well,
justice
ginsburg,
they're
doing
it
under
these
decisions
of
this
court
is
the
reason
why
that
they've
articulated
that
this
has
to
be
done.
they're
saying
it's
a
functional
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea.
therefore,
boykin
is
required
and
therefore
there
has
to
be
a
colloquy.
and
we
think
that
those
colloquies
are
tremendously
problematic,
that
they
invade
the
attorney-client
privilege.
they
may
affect
an
accused's
right
to...
you
know,
not
to
self-incriminate
himself.
there
may
violate
the
relationship
between
the
lawyer
and
his
client.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
they
are.
the
florida
supreme
court
specifically
says
you
must
have
these
colloquies
to
determine
consent.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
the
lower...
justice,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
it's
only
there
that
they've
required
it,
but
lower
courts
now
defense
counsel
are
making
these
arguments
that,
boy,
you
know,
and
the
judge
is
concerned
this
is
a
strategy
decision.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
it's
not
before
your
honor.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
that's
correct.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
i'd
like
to
point
this
court
to
page
486
of
the
joint
appendix
where
mr.
corin
is
asked,
do
you
feel
in
this
case
that
you
were
put
in
a
position
that
you
had
to
make
decisions
because
your
client
did
nothing?
and
he
said,
yes,
sir.
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
post-trial
proceedings
that
mr.
corin
wanted
the
help
of
his
client.
he
did
not
want
to
be
on
the
bridge
of
the
ship
alone,
but
mr.
nixon
abandoned
the
ship.
and
although
he
consulted
with
his
client
at
least
three
times
on
this
trial
strategy,
there
was
no
input
back
that
would
have
given
him
any
reason
to
believe
that
mr.
nixon
did
not
want
him
to
go
forward
to
pursue
a
strategy
that
mr.
corin,
in
his
experience
of
14
years
as
a
lawyer,
after
having
taken
52
depositions
in
this
case,
believed
was
in
the
best
interest
of
his
client.
i
just
have
a
couple
of
points
i'd
like
to
make.
there
was
a
question
that
was
asked
about
whether
or
not
the...
the
guilt
phase
and
the
penalty
phase
are
distinct
parts
of
a
trial.
this
court
has
addressed
that
in
the
monj
v.
california
case
when
it
said
that
it's
really
one
trial
and
that
issues
of
guilt
and
innocence
are
often,
in
a
capital
trial,
still
being
determined
in
the
penalty
phase
of
that
matter.
i'd
also
like
to
mention
the
point
that
the
counsel
made
about
cronic.
counsel
would
ask,
as
the
florida
supreme
court
did,
to
apply
cronic
to
this
situation.
there
is
a
harmony
that
exists
in
this
jurisprudence
between
strickland
and
cronic.
issues
of
trial
performance
and
trial
strategy
are
articulated
and
evaluated
under
strickland's
two-part
standard.
questions
of
structural
defects
that
infect
the
process
with
error
are
evaluated
under
cronic.
and
that
harmony
works
in
the
system.
it
allows
for
the
independence
and
vitality
of
counsel
to
pursue
strategies
in
their
clients'
best
interests
and
it
also
allows
when
there
are
structural
defects,
for
them
to
be
taken
care
of
with
the
presumption.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
yes,
i
am,
your
honor,
and
i'll
get
to
that
right
now.
there
was
ample
opportunity.
there
were
three
hearings.
and
in
fact,
there
was
disagreement
between
the
sides
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
this
opportunity
for
a
strickland
hearing.
we
don't
have
strickland
hearings--
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
--your
honor,
i
would
point
the
court
to
pages
385
to
390
of
the
appendix
where
judge
smith
denies
the
strickland
claim.
the
defense
has
the
burden
of
proving
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
during
the
first
hearing,
there
was
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
an
ineffective
counsel
hearing
because
it
was
still
on
direct
appeal.
but
certainly
in
hearings
two
and
three,
there
was
ample
opportunity
to
put
that
evidence
on
the
record,
and
they
didn't
take
that
opportunity.
now,
they
quibbled
and
said
they
didn't
have
notice
and
they
didn't
know
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
here
for
a
strickland
hearing.
we
disagree
with
that
because
there
aren't
strickland
hearings,
there
are
not
cronic
hearings.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
well,
they
had
not
yet
won
under
cronic,
your
honor.
they
were
still
making
those
arguments.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
this
is...
there
was
a
hearing
before
that
and
a
hearing
after
that.
mr.
george
s.
lemieux
in
conclusion,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
harmony
between
these
two
lines
of
cases
works,
that
the
florida
supreme
court
got
it
wrong,
and
for
that
reason,
we
would
request
reversal.
thank
you.
