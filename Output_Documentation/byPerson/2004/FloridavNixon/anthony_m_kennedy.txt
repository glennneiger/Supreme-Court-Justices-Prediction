justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
mr.
nixon
was...
was
the
client.
was
he
in
the
courtroom?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was...
was
he
there...
and
i'll
check
the
record...
when
the
attorney
told
the
jury
that...
that
his
client
was...
was
guilty,
that
he
basically
was
conceding
guilt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
not
for
the
opening
statement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
getting
back
to
the
practical
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea,
brookhart
v.
janis
do
you
think
goes
to
the
outer
margin
of
what
the
functional
equivalent
is?
are
there
other
examples
of
what
a
functional
equivalent
would
be
that
would
fall
under
both
cronic
and
brookhart?
we
have
a
line-drawing
problem--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--as...
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
the
functional
equivalent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
take
it
as
a
given
that
if
he
does
not
consent,
in
fact,
directs
his
lawyer
not
to
make
this
concession,
that
the
lawyer
is
bound
to
follow?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does...
does
that
up
the
ante
and
the
defendant
now
is
in
the
position
to
terminate
the
lawyer,
or
will
the
judge
say
it's...
it's
too
late,
i'm
not
going
to
grant
that
motion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as...
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
a
substantial
component
of
reasonableness
under
strickland
is
whether
or
not
you
follow
the
client's
instructions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you...
you
equate
this
to
a
case
where
the
defendant
is
just
accidentally
not
present.
that's...
that's
what
i
got.
i...
i
had
the
same
problem
with
your
opening
two
sentences
as
justice
ginsburg
did.
you
said
if
the
defendant
is
absent
from
the
courtroom.
well,
in
this
case,
he
was
absent
because
he
chose
to
be
absent.
you're...
you're
equating
this
case
to
one
in
which
it
was
as
if
for
some
reason
they
forgot
to
have
him
in
the
courtroom.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
why
you're
so...
i
thought
that
the
literature
was
replete
with
law
review
articles
saying
that
this
is
the
best
strategy.
trial
judges
have
told
us
this
is
the
best
strategy.
i...
i
don't
quite
understand
your
hesitation
unless
it's
to
build
in
this...
this
factor
of
consent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
thought
this...
this
was
something
you'd
say,
well,
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
what...
what
about
the
basic
question,
that
as
a
matter
of
trial
strategy,
it
is
a
recognized,
acceptable,
sometimes
prudent,
sometimes
wise
strategy
to
concentrate
on
a
sentencing
phase?
