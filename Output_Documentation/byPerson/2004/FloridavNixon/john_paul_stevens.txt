justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
now
hear
argument
in
florida
against
nixon.
mr.
lemieux.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
if...
do
you
think
his
representation
would
have
been
inadequate
if
he
had
not
discussed
the
strategy
with
the
client
but
everything
else
was
exactly
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
would
it
be...
why
would
it
make
any
difference
under
strickland
whether
he
talked
to
the
client
or
not
if
the
same...
if
the
same
considerations
are
in
play?
in
other
words,
he
just
knew
it
was
the...
the
wiser
strategy
to
try
and
save
him
from
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
rather
difficult
to...
to
draw
that
line.
if...
if
consent
is
necessary,
why
shouldn't
it
be
express?
i'm
not
saying
consent
is
necessary,
but
normally
if
you're
going
to
have
something
this
important
and
consent
is
necessary,
it
seems
to
me
it
ought
to
be
clear
on
the
record.
you
certainly
wouldn't
accept
this
for
a
guilty
plea,
what
you
have
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right,
and
that's
why
i'm
suggesting
if
it
really
is
a
question
of
strategy,
you
don't
even
need
implicit
consent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
not
sure
there's
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--three-part
rule,
as
justice
scalia
says.
there's
just
a
two-part
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
these...
let
me
just
understand.
these
colloquies
are
not,
in
your
view,
commanded
by
the
florida
supreme
court's
holding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
only...
is
it...
it's
not
just
when
there's
the
equivalent
of
the
guilty
plea,
but
any
major
trial
strategy--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
this...
i
want
to
know
if
the
florida
supreme
court's
holding
is
limited
to
cases
that
are
the
functional
equivalent
of...
of
a
guilty
plea,
and...
and
it's
only
there
that
they're
requiring
the
colloquy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
of
course
what
the
lower
courts
are
doing
may
or
may
not
be
right
as
a
matter
of
florida
law,
but
that's
not
before
us
really.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gornstein.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
tillinghast.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tillinghast,
can
i
ask
you
if
you
are
familiar
with
the
loeb/leopold
trial
many,
many
years
ago
that
was
conducted
by
clarence
darrow?
if
you're
not,
i
won't
push
you
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
he...
he
applied
exactly
this
strategy
and
it
was
one
of
his
great
victories.
in...
in
fact,
it's
a
long,
long
time
ago.
but
that
was
the
way
clarence
darrow
sized
up
this
very
problem,
and
the...
and
i
think
in
that
case
they
were
very
young
clients
that
he
had.
they
didn't...
they
were
not...
they
did
not
expressly
consent
to
what
he
did.
but
he
saved
their
lives.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
tillinghast.
mr.
lemieux,
you
have
about
4
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
should...
why
should
they
put
in
strickland
evidence
if
they've
won
under
cronic?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
it
was
remanded
for
an
issue...
for
a
hearing
on
the
consent
issue
after--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
