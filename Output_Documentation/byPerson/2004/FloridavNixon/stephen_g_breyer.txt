what...
what
about
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
boykin
and...
boykin
and...
and
brookhart
were
about
really
a
somewhat
different
matter.
the
language,
functional
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea,
is
lifted
from
brookhart.
boykin
and
brookhart
are
about
what
a
judge
does,
not
about
what
a
lawyer
does.
in
boykin,
the
judge
accepted
the
guilty
plea,
and
the
court
said
you
can't
do
it
without
the
express
consent
of
the
defendant.
in
brookhart,
it
was
a
judge
who
accepted...
now,
here
it
was
an
odd
procedure,
and
it
was
that
procedure
that
the
court
called
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea.
and
therefore,
we're
talking
about
what
a
judge
can
do.
here
we're
not.
we're
talking
about
what
a
lawyer
can
do
and
when
it
arises
to
the
level
of
improper
lack
of
counsel.
so
i
don't
think
they
govern
it.
rather,
i
thought...
and
i
want
your
view
on
this...
that
the
most
relevant
case
was
really
roe
v.
flores,
you
know,
where...
where
the
lawyer
did
a
weird
thing.
he
didn't
file
an
appeal.
and
here
he's
doing
a
little
odd
thing.
so
what
we
said
there
is
you
have
to
consult,
which
is
just
what
the
government
is
saying
here.
i'm
exposing
that
thought
process
to
you
to
get
your
reaction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
not
a
guilty
plea
and
the
words...
a
guilty
plea
is
something
accepted
by
a
judge
and
the
judge
didn't.
but
i
grant
you
it's
a
very
odd
situation
and
very
special,
and
that's
why
i
wonder
what
the
appropriate
way
to...
what
kind
of
requirement
there
ought
to
be.
maybe
there
should
be
something.
i'm
not
sure
why
it
should
rise
above
the
level
of
consultation
since
you
know,
better
than
i,
you
can
have
some
awfully
difficult
clients
who
are
virtually
incapable
of
understanding
what's
in
their
interests.
and...
and
that's
why
i'm
awfully
reluctant
to
go
beyond
saying
you
have
to
consult
with
your
client.
you
start
insisting
on
an
answer,
and
you
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
say.
