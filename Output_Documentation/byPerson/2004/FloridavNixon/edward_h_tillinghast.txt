mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
a
defense
counsel
can
concede
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
his
opening
and
in
his
closing
statements
in
the
trial,
particularly
when
the
defendant
is
not
present.
we
submit
that
the
answer
is
no,
and
there's
two
reasons
that
it's
no.
first,
we
believe
that
it's
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea
as
found
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
second,
because
the...
what
was
stated
was
so
clearly
an
acknowledgement
that
the
state
had
proven
its
case,
that
there
was
a
complete
breakdown
of
the
adversarial
process
and
there
was
no
meaningful
testing
of
the
state's
case.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
justice
ginsburg,
part
of
the
issue
here
is...
is
the
lack
of
consent.
mr.
nixon
was
not
present
during
the
entire
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
what
we
would
submit
is
that
in
this
case
where
there
was
the
hearing
in
a
holding
cell...
it
was
on
the
record.
it's
part
of
the
record
before
your
honor...
where
the
judge
inquired
about
mr.
nixon's
willingness
to
participate
in
his
trial,
and
he
declined
to
go
into
the
courtroom,
that
refusal
to
go
into
the
courtroom,
we
submit,
was
a
refusal
to
attend
the...
the
hearing
on
the
presumption
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
trial
consistent
with
his
guilty
plea...
or
not
guilty
plea...
excuse
me...
the
not
guilty
plea
that
was
entered.
what
he
anticipated
was
a
trial
where
the
state's
case
was...
was
tested
and
it
was
consistent
with
his
not
guilty
plea.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
well,
the...
the
important
issue
here
is
there
was
not
consent.
the
lack
of
his
presence
in
the
courtroom
compounded
that
problem,
but
the
important
issue
here
and
the
issue
before
the
court
is
that
defense
counsel
conceded
guilt
and
conceded
that
the
state
had
proven
its
case
without
the
consent
of
his
own
client.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
well,
respectfully,
your
honor,
i
would...
i
would
disagree
because
that
what...
what
we
do
have
from
mr.
nixon
is
he
stated
that...
that
he
had
fired
his
lawyer.
he
wanted
a
black
lawyer.
he
wanted
a
black
judge,
and
that
he
didn't
want
to
go
into
the
courtroom
because
he
would
be
railroaded.
that
was
after
in
the
newspaper
it
had
indicated
that
he
had...
that
his
counsel
had
pled
him
guilty
in
his
opening
statement,
and
he
was
clearly
objecting
to
that
conduct.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
actually
the...
you're
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
the...
the
railroading
statements
were
before
the
opening
statements.
the
objection
to
the
newspaper
story
was
after
the
opening
statement.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
yes.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
if
the
court...
if
the
court
was
to
look
at
the
totality
and...
as
opposed
to
looking
at
the
guilt
phase,
what
would
happen
would
be
that
capital
cases
would
have...
would
end
up
having
a
lower
standard
than
a
non-capital
case
because--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--the
difficulty
here
is...
is
this
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea
without
consent,
and--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--your
honor--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--with...
with
statements
in
the
opening--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--not
without
the
consent
of
a
client
with
statements
like
this.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
there
could
be
circumstances.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
well,
it
is
the--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--it...
it
is
the
factor
of
the
consent.
in...
in
this
case,
in
the
opening
statement,
the--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--in
the
general
sense,
yes.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
well,
justice,
the...
the
distinction
here
is...
is
it...
it
wasn't
a
strategy
to
not
contest
the
state's
case.
what
it...
what
it
was
was
it
was
a
complete
concession
in
opening
statement
that
the
state
would
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
issue
here
is
that
he
did
that
and
he
went
beyond
just
saying
that
he
did
it.
he
said
that
the
state
has
proven
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
murder
and
arson,
and
he
did
it
without
consent.
that's--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--i
would
submit
that
in
this
case,
because
that
it
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea,
and
as
this
court
has
held
under
boykin
and
under
brookhart
that
you
must
have
voluntary
and
willing
and
knowing
consent--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--well,
justice
o'connor,
if...
if
you're...
if
the
court
was
to
view
it
as
not
the
functional
equivalent,
as
you've
suggested,
you
could
affirm
based
upon
the
nature
of
the
statements
and
finding
that
there
was
a
complete
failure
under
cronic.
and...
and
with
respect
to
the
trial,
there
were...
there
were
35
witnesses
called
by
the
state.
there
were
five
what
i
would
submit
were
perfunctory
questions
asked
on
cross.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
well,
strickland
is...
is
respectfully
not
before
the
court.
it
was...
the
record
below
was
strictly
on--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--yes.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
yes.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
i...
i
think,
first,
under...
under
jones
v.
barnes,
it's
been
held
by
this
court
that
there
are
three
fundamental
things
that
only
the
client
can
do,
one
of
which
is
to
plead
guilty.
and
in...
in
the
roe
case,
the...
the
record
below
was...
was
unclear
as
to
what
happened
as
to
whether
there
was
a
duty
for
the
attorney
to
file
an
appeal
and
what
the
conversations
were
or
were
not
with...
with
the
defendant.
but
we
would
submit
that...
that
a
guilty
plea
is
something
very
special
because
that
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
case.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
well,
the...
the
lawyer
here
did
have
alternatives.
he...
he
could
have
put
the
state
to
its
burden
and
consistent
with
the
not
guilty
plea
that
was
entered
in
the
case.
or
as
an
alternative,
there
could
have
been
an
inquiry
on
the
record
of...
by
the
judge
with
the
lawyers
of
mr.
nixon
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
was
consenting
to
this...
this
sort
of...
the
opening
statements
and
the
closing
statements,
which...
which
were
extraordinary,
particularly
the
closing
statement
because...
and
in
the
closing
statement,
he
specifically
said
that
the
state
did
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
each
and
every
element
of
the
crimes
charged,
first
degree,
premeditated
murder,
kidnapping,
robbery,
and
arson,
had
been
proven,
which
is
truly
extraordinary.
here
is
a
situation
where
the
lawyer
who
is
the
only
person
in
the
courtroom,
because
mr.
nixon
was
tried
in
absentia,
who...
the
only
person
in
the
courtroom
who
was
there
as
the
trusted
advisor
and
counselor
for
mr.
nixon,
stands
up
in
front
of
the
jury
in
the
opening
and
the
closing
and
concedes
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
would
submit
that
upon
doing
that,
the...
the
whole
adversarial
process
breaks
down
because
it--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--the
difficulty,
again...
it
comes
back
to
the
lack
of
consent.
had
he
had
consent,
it
would
be
different.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
in...
in...
particularly
in
a
capital
case,
what
this
court
and
all
courts
would...
would
want
is
a
reliable
record
where
there
had
been
testing.
when
you
have
a
situation
where
mr.
nixon,
as
here,
said
nothing,
so
the...
so
mr.
corin
didn't
know
whether
there
was
consent
or
lack
of
consent,
we
would
submit
that
what
should
have
happened
is,
as
i
said...
suggested
before,
he
shouldn't
have...
he
could
have
not
contested
certain
things,
but
the
admission
on
the...
what
i
submit
is
an
admission
and
a
plea
of
guilty
without
consent
was
where
the
problem
was.
he
could
have
gone
on--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--he
had
the
alternative
of...
of
having
an
inquiry
with
mr.
nixon,
with
the
court
determine
whether
or
not--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--well--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--i
would
respectfully
submit
that
given
the
nature
of
the
opening
and
closing,
the
words
that
were
used,
in...
in
that
kind
of
a
extreme
situation,
that
is
a
decision
that
the
client
should
make.
this
is
not
a
decision
that
is
a
normal
strategy
decision
that
a
lawyer
would
normally
make,
such
as
which
witnesses
to...
to
call,
aside
from
the
defendant
himself,
the
order
of
the
witnesses,
and...
and
types
of
cross
examination.
this
is
a
very--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--the...
in...
in
this
situation,
it's...
it's
the
nature
of
what
was
said
and
his
lack
of
presence
in
the
courtroom
where
there
was
no
affirmative
defense.
and
in...
in
the
record
below
where
the
florida
supreme
court
sent
it
down
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
consent,
there
was
no
acquiescence.
mr.
nixon
simply
did
nothing.
when...
when
asked...
when
mr.
corin
testified
and
was
asked
about
whether
he
discussed
the
trial
strategy
and
whether
mr.
nixon
agreed
or
disagreed,
mr.
nixon
simply
did
nothing.
he...
he
didn't
acquiesce
to
the
strategy.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
unfortunately,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
well,
if...
besides
the...
what
we
believe
was
a
fundamental...
what
was
a
complete
failure...
excuse
me.
aside
from
the
guilty
plea,
what
we
submit
is
a
guilty
plea,
we
believe
that
when
these
kinds
of
statements
were
made,
your
honor,
without
the
consent,
that
the
advocacy
system
that
was
envisioned
in
cronic
completely
failed.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
the...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
when
i
say
yes,
the...
what
would...
what
would
be
left
is
an
entire
hearing
on
the...
on
the
strickland
claims
and
the
motion
to
vacate.
that...
that
would
be
the
remaining
part
of
the
case--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--because
the...
the
hearings
below,
when
it
was
sent
back
down
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
were
only
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
consent
to...
to
the...
what
the
florida
supreme
court
deemed
to
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea.
there
was
not
a
hearing
on
the
balance
of
the
issues,
and
it
was
strictly
limited
to
that.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
no.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
no.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
it
was
actually
denied
by
judge
hall.
so
the
only
thing
that's...
that's
occurred
is
the
hearing
strictly
on
whether
or
not
there
was...
was
consent.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
it
was...
it
was
because
of
the
focus
of
the
florida
supreme
court
on...
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
consent.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
he--
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
--it
was
raised
but...
but
he
was
not
given
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
on
that.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
yes.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
yes.
mr.
edward
h.
tillinghast
iii
so,
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
we
submit
that
there
are
two...
two
approaches
to
affirming
the
florida
supreme
court.
first
is...
is
that
it
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea
without
consent.
the
second
is
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
statements,
it
was
a
complete
failure
of
the
advocacy
process
where
the
state's
case
was
not
tested
in
any
way.
in
fact,
as
i
mentioned,
there
were
35
witnesses.
there
were
five
very
perfunctory
questions
asked
such
as
what
date
was
it
and
when
did
certain
things
occur.
there
was
not
the
material
testing
of
the
record
to
determine
the
truth,
which
is
what
is...
is
involved
in
the
sixth
amendment.
and
none
of...
none
of
the
challenges,
that
are
pointed
out
in...
to
the
facts
in
our
brief
ever
came
out
because
that
there
was
no
testing.
simply
we
have
an
opening
statement
where
counsel
says
the
state
will
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
these
events
occurred.
then
we
have
virtually
no
cross
examination.
we
have
no
witnesses
called
by
the
state...
excuse
me...
by...
by
the
defendant
throughout
the
entire
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
and
in
fact,
at
one
point,
the...
the
trial
judge
stopped
asking...
asking
mr.
corin
if
he
wished
to
cross
examine.
and
then
we
have
the
closing
statement
where
mr.
corin
stated
that
the
state
has
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that...
that
he
is...
mr.
nixon
was
guilty
of
the
crimes.
and
all
the
while
during
that
guilt
phase,
mr.
nixon
was
not
present
in
the
courtroom.
so
he
had
no
ability
to
object
to
the
opening
or
the
closing
statements
because
he
wasn't
here...
there
to
hear
them.
and
further,
as...
as
the
record
indicates,
there
are
issues
of...
of
mr.
nixon's
competency,
that
he's
mentally
retarded.
his
own
lawyer
referred
to
him
as
nuts.
his
own
lawyer
also
referred
to
him
as
an
ogre
in
his
closing
argument.
these
are
the
types
of
statements,
we
would
submit,
are...
even
if
they
are
not
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea
without
consent,
they...
they
substantially
and
completely
destroy
the
advocacy
process.
so
there
is
no
testing,
and
under
cronic,
the
court
should
affirm
also.
thank
you.
