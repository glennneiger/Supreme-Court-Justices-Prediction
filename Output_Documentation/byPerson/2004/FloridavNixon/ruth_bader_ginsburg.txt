they
may,
but
that
wasn't
a
definitive
ruling.
so
do
you
agree
that
if
we
accept
the
position
that
you
are
taking,
a
remand
would
require
for
that...
for
that
evidence
to
be
considered
on
the
straightforward
question
did
counsel
perform
adequately?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happened
to
the
photographs?
i
wasn't
clear
from
the
submissions.
there
were
inflammatory
photographs.
were
they
in
fact
admitted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
were
not
reintroduced
at
the
sentencing
phase.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
there
were
a
plea...
if
it
were
a
plea
of
guilt,
wouldn't
this
be
an
academic
question
because
i
assume
florida
has
some
counterpart
to
the
rule
11
colloquy
where
the
judge
must
confront
the
defendant
and
ask
him
a
series
of
questions
to
elicit
his
consent?
so
this
issue
can
come
up,
if
you
have
a
counterpart
to
rule
11,
only
in
the
concession
of
guilt
by
the
attorney
but
with
a
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
florida
wanted
to
adopt
that
procedure
on
its
own,
that
wouldn't
present
a
federal
question.
i
mean,
the
prosecutor
would
have
no...
the
prosecutor
would
have
no
right
to
stop
it
if
the...
if
florida
said,
well,
we
want
that
same
colloquy
to
go
on
whether
it's
a
guilty
plea
or
whether
it's
a
concession
of
guilt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tillinghast,
may
i
go
back
to
something
you
said?
because
i
don't
want
to
lose
sight
of
it.
you
seem
to
suggest
that
the
defendant's
absence
from
the
trial
should
work
in
his
favor
when
this
was
defendant's
own
choice
not
to
be
there.
the
judge
met
with
him
and
said
i
want
to
make
sure
you
know
what
you're
doing.
right?
why
should
we
count
at
all
in
the
defendant's
favor
that
he
was...
he
absented
himself
from
trial
any
more
than
we
would
give
a
fugitive
credit
for
not
being
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
entirely
because
both
in
the
opening
and
in
closing,
the
lawyer
said
to
the
jury,
he
did
it,
but
i
want
you
to
know
from
my
very
opening
that
this
case
is
about
life
or
death,
and
that's
the
ultimate
decision
you
will
have
to
make.
he
said
that
in
his
opening
and
he
said
it
in
his
closing.
it
wasn't
simply
a
case
of
saying,
my
client
did
and
now
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
go
through
the
motions.
he
told
the
jury,
what
i
want
you
to
focus
on
is
the
decision
you're
going
to
have
to
make
whether,
in
the
counsel's
words,
to
spare
his
life.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
say
without
consent.
at
least
as...
the
record
that
we
have
suggests
that
the
client
was
told
this
is
what
the
lawyer
planned
to
do
and
said
nothing.
justice
scalia
asked
a
question
when
the
prior
argument
was
ongoing.
when
a
client
doesn't
say
yes
and
he
doesn't
say
no,
to
take
the
words
of
a
familiar
song,
mustn't
the
lawyer
then
do
what
he
thinks
is
best
to
do?
because
if
he
says,
okay,
i'm
going
to...
i'm
going
to
require
a
full-stop
trial,
i'm
going
to
cross
examine
every
witness,
he
may
be
damaging
his
client.
the
client
didn't
tell
him
not
to
do
that
any
more
than
he
told
him
to
do
it.
so
mustn't
the
lawyer
in
that
situation
exercise
his
best
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
when...
when
his
object
is
to
spare
this
person's
life.
he
knows
the
evidence
is
very
strong.
he
wants,
to
the
extent
that
he
can,
insulate
the
penalty
phase
from
all
that
damning
evidence
that's
coming
out
at
the
trial.
so
he
wants
the
evidence
to
come
out
at
the
trial,
but
he
doesn't
want
to
be
in
a
situation
where
the
jury
has
heard
the
defendant
resist
the
determination
that
he
did
it
and
then
have
to
plead
for
his
life
after.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
my
problem...
and
i...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
it.
in
this
case,
in
fact
the
client
didn't
say
yes
and
he
didn't
say
no.
so
if
the...
if
the
lawyer
is
to
assume,
well,
then
since
i
don't
have
a
positive,
explicit
yes,
i
will
assume
the
answer
is
no,
even
though
that
is
against
the
lawyer's
best
interest...
the...
the
lawyer's
best
judgment,
why
is
he
an
effective
counsel
if
he
assumes
the
answer
is
no?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
i
asked
the
other
side?
and
that
is,
if
we
don't
accept
your
argument,
if
we
think
when
the
client
is
silent,
the
lawyer
must
exercise
his
best
judgment
and
not
assume
that
the
client
would
give
an
answer
that
would
jeopardize
the
client's
position,
if
that's
the
position
that
this
court
adopts,
what
would
you
say
is
left
over
for
remand?
is
it
simply
that
the
florida
supreme
court
then
takes
the
record
as
it
is
and
determines
under
strickland
whether
there
was
effective...
ineffective
performance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be...
that
would
be
all.
so
what
do
we
do
with,
in
the
brief,
all
this
information
about
things
that
the
lawyer
should
have
done
by
way
of
cross
examination?
that
wasn't
put
in
the
record
earlier--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
was
it
denied
in
the
trial
court?
why
was
the
introduction
of
what
the
lawyer
might
have
done--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
a
strategic
decision
defends
counsel
made
in
a
capital
murder
trial.
counsel's
strategy
was
to
concede
at
the
guilt
based
of
the
trial
that
the
defendant
committed
the
crime
by
projecting
candor.
the
attorney
believed
he
would
be
better
positioned
at
the
penalty
phase
to
urge
the
jury
to
spare
his
client's
life.
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
a
concession
of
guilt
at
trial
made
without
the
defendant's
expressed
consent
automatically
ranks
as
prejudicial
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
necessitating
a
new
trial.
we
reverse
the
florida
supreme
court's
judgment.
respondent
joe
elton
nixon,
the
capital
murder
defendant,
confessed
to
kidnapping
a
woman
tying
her
to
a
tree,
setting
her
on
fire
while
still
alive
and
leaving
her
to
burn
to
death.
the
state
armed
with
powerful
evidence
of
nixon’s
guilt
sought
the
death
penalty.
given
the
strength
of
the
state's
case
nixon’s
appointed
counsel
thought
it
unwise
to
attempt
a
defendant
did
not
commit
the
crime
defense.
instead
counsel
aimed
to
persuade
the
jury
at
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial
that
nixon
committed
the
murder
while
mentally
imbalanced.
to
this
end
the
counsel
would
offer
evidence
that
nixon
had
a
long
history
of
emotional
instability
or
low
iq
and
possible
brain
damage.
counsel
several
times
explained
the
strategy
to
nixon,
each
time
nixon
said
nothing
in
reply.
counsel
proceeded
with
his
plan
strategy
but
despite
the
evidence
of
nixon’s
mental
disabilities
the
jury
recommended
and
the
trial
court
imposed
the
death
penalty.
notably
however
the
trial
judge
commended
counsel
performance
describing
the
tactics
nixon’s
attorney
employed
as
an
excellent
analysis
of
the
reality
of
his
case.
the
florida
supreme
court
viewed
the
case
differently.
that
court
regarded
counsel's
concession
of
nixon’s
guilt
as
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
guilty
plea.
consent
to
a
guilty
plea
can
not
be
inferred
from
silence
the
florida
supreme
court
correctly
observed,
similarly
a
concession
of
guilt
at
trial
that
court
held
required
the
defendants
express
consent.
we
disagree
with
the
latter
assessment.
counsel
must
consult
with
his
client
but
when
the
client
is
unresponsive
counsel
must
be
free
to
follow
his
own
professional
judgment.
the
florida
court
incorrectly
equated
a
guilty
plea
to
concession
a
guilt
at
trial.
unlike
a
defendant
guilty
who
has
pleaded
guilty
nixon
retained
the
constitutional
rights
that
in
here
in
the
criminal
preceding
one
such
right
counsel
could
object
to
items
of
evidence
attended
by
the
prosecution.
the
state
was
oblige
to
present
during
the
guilt
phase
proof
convincing
the
jury
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
on
every
element
of
the
charged
defense
that
aggressive
evidence
would
as
be
distanced
from
the
penalty
phase
enabling
the
defense
to
concentrate
that
portion
of
the
trial
on
mitigating
factors.
the
florida
courts
erroneous
equations
of
counsel's
concessions
strategy
to
a
guilty
plea
led
it
to
apply
the
wrong
standard
in
evaluating
counsel's
effectiveness.
that
court
first
presumed
deficient
performance
and
then
applied
a
presumption
of
prejudice
derived
from
our
decision
in
united
states
v.
cronic.
but
in
cronic
we
reserved
the
presumption
of
prejudice
for
situations
in
which
counsel
has
entirely
fail
to
function
as
the
client's
advocate.
on
the
record
considered
by
the
florida
supreme
court
counsel's
concession
of
guilt
scarcely
ranks
as
a
failure
of
that
order.
the
florida
court
should
have
employed
the
generally
applicable
standard
this
court
stated
in
strickland
v.
washington;
it
should
have
asked
did
counsel's
representation
fall
outside
the
balance
of
reasonable
professional
conduct.
commentators
have
observed
that
when
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
and
the
crime
heinous,
counsel
who
attempts
an
implausible
defense
may
jeopardize
his
client's
chances
for
a
life
sentence
in
lieu
of
the
death
penalty.
reknowned
advocate
clarence
darrow
successfully
employed
a
similar
strategy
as
counsel
for
the
youthful
cold-blooded
killers
richard
loeb
and
nathan
leopold.
as
justice
stevens
recalled
at
oral
argument
in
this
case
darrow's
clients
did
not
expressly
consent
to
what
he
did
but
he
saved
their
lives.
in
sum,
when
counsel
informs
a
capital
defendant
of
the
strategy
counsel
believes
to
be
in
the
defendant’s
best
interest.
counsel's
strategic
choice
is
not
impeded
by
any
blanket
rule
demanding
the
defendant's
explicit
consent
instead
taking
account
of
the
evidence
bearing
on
the
defendant’s
guilt
if
counsel's
strategy
was
reasonable
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
no
tenable
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
would
remain.
the
chief
justice
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
all
other
members
of
this
court
have
joined
in
the
opinion.
