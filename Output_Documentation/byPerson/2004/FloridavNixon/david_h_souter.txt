justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but...
no.
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
they
didn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
it...
it
might
be
that
there
would
be
no
justification
for
further
evidence,
but
there
would
have
to
be
a
strickland
ruling
on
the
merits
of
the
strickland
issue,
wouldn't
there
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
nobody
has
explicitly
done
that
yet.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
of
the
cronic
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that...
isn't
that
because
we...
we
take
the
consultation
at...
at
least
as
an
indication
that
the
lawyer
was...
was
adequate
in
communicating
back
and
forth
with
the
client
so
that
the
client
could
tell
him
what
the
lawyer
needed
to
know
to
defend
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what...
what
if
there's
a
third
possibility
and...
and
the
lawyer
makes
remarks
in
front
of
the
jury,
as...
as
this
lawyer
did,
in
effect,
concession
kind
of
remarks,
and
the
defendant
stands
up
and
says,
hey,
i'm
not
making
those
concessions?
i
am
not
guilty.
i'm
not
conceding
a
darned
thing.
does
the
lawyer
at
that
point
at
least
have
a...
an
option
to
proceed
on
the
concession
theory,
leaving
it
to
judge
his
performance
under
strickland
afterwards?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
actually
i...
i
didn't
get
into
that
one
way
or
the
other.
let's
assume
we've
got
a
case
in
which
the
client
says,
no,
i...
i
don't
agree
to
these
concessions.
i'm
not
guilty
and
i
want
a
defense.
as
i
understood
your...
your
earlier
answer,
you
said
if...
you
know,
if
it
is
the
lawyer's
considered
judgment
that
this
is
the
only
way
to
save
his
life...
he's
talked
with
him,
et
cetera...
he...
he
still
may
have
that
option
to
concede.
and
i'm
taking
the...
the
facts
one
step
further
and
saying
let's
assume
the...
the
client
goes
whole-hog
in
his
objection.
and
he
stands
up
or...
or
says
in
front
of
the
judge
and
the
jury,
i...
i'm
not
conceding
any
of
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
would
certainly
agree
if
we
get
to
that
point.
but
let's
the
lawyer
does,
as
you
at
least
left
the
door
open
for
him
to
do,
and...
and
he
does
proceed
to
represent
the
guy.
the
judge
doesn't
remove
him
and
the
lawyer
continues
to
concede.
do
you...
do
you
think
that
there
is
any
possibility
on
a
strickland
analysis
of
finding
adequacy
of
counsel?
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
question
just
about
what
you...
what
you're
assuming
when
you
make
the...
the
statement...
prefaced
the
argument
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
complete
breakdown
of...
of
the
adversary
process.
you're
assuming,
i
take
it,
when
you
say
that,
that
the
guilt
phase
and
the
penalty
phase
have
got
to
be
regarded
as
distinct
and
separate
phases.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
dividing
it
in
half.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
that...
why
is
that
legitimate?
why
should
a
lawyer...
i
mean,
i
presume
no
defense
lawyer
tailors
his...
his
guilt
phase
representation
without
a
thought
to
what
is
going
to
happen
at
the
penalty
phase
if
they
get
to
the
penalty
phase.
and
so
i...
i
have
difficulty
in
saying
that
there
should
be
some
kind
of
a
firewall
for
analytical
purposes
between
guilt
and
penalty
when...
when
we're
in
a...
a
question
of
cronic
or
strickland.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
wouldn't
end
up
having
lower
standards.
they...
they
would
end
up
having
a...
a
standard
at
the
guilt
phase
which
takes
into
consideration
what
the
lawyer
is
or
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
plausibly
at...
at
the
sentencing
phase.
and
you
know,
those...
those
may
be
very,
very
difficult
questions,
but
it's
hard
for
me
to
say
that
either
the
standard
is
different
or
that
a
lawyer
should...
or
that
we,
in
setting
down
standards,
should
pretend
that
a
lawyer
somehow
has
to
go
into
a
state
of
oblivion
about...
about
what's
going
to
happen
at
sentencing
if
he
gets
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
no,
but
i
don't
think
you're
getting
to...
at...
at
what
bothers
us.
nobody
is
saying
that
the
client
should
not
make
a
decision.
the
problem
is
that
the
client
won't
make
a
decision,
and
the
client
acts
as
if
he
had
made
the
decision
to
allow
the
lawyer
to
do
what
the
lawyer
proposes.
this
isn't
a
question
of
whether
he
should
be
heard
or
not,
but
what...
what
to
make
of
the
behavior.
and
you're
saying
when...
when
the
behavior
appears
to
be
acquiescence
from
silence,
you
nonetheless...
the
lawyer
is,
nonetheless,
obligated
to
take
the
course
which
is
coming
closest
to
guaranteeing
that
he
will
receive
the
death
penalty.
and
that's
what's
bothering
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
do
we
need
a
hearing
rather
than
an
examination
of
the
record?
tell
me
why.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
we're
talking
about
the
trial
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
was
he
denied
the
opportunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
the...
did
the
judge
say,
look,
we're...
we're
going
to
confine
it
strictly
to
this
one
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
did
the
judge...
what
did
judge
say?
your
brother
said
the
judge
said,
no,
i
won't
hear
this.
