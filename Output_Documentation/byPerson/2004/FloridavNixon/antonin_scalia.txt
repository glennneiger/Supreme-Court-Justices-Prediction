there
was
also
an
objection
to
introduction
of...
of
photographs
that...
that
were
inflammatory,
wasn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
those
photographs
would
have
infected
the...
the
penalty
phase,
as
well
as
the
guilt
phase.
so
it
was
important
for
him
to
object
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
guilt
phase.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
side
says
that
guilt
is
not
as...
not
as
clear
as
you...
as
you
make
it
out.
is...
is
that...
is
that
issue
even
before
us
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
isn't
a
matter
of
whether
it's
before
it.
i...
i
just
wonder
whether
it
goes
to...
to
the
issue
here,
whether
you
needed
to
get
his
assent
or
not.
it...
it
probably
goes
to
the
quite
separate
question
of
whether
there
was
inadequate
performance
by
counsel.
no?
is
that
question
before
us
also?
justice
antonin
scalia
was...
was
the
latter
question
ruled
upon
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
never...
and
never
reached
the...
the
inadequate
performance
of
counsel
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
about
the
courts
below
the
florida
supreme
court?
didn't
they
rule
on
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
any
cases
involving
what...
what
you
describe
as
tacit
consent?
justice
antonin
scalia
in...
in
terms
of...
of
pleading
guilty.
do
we
have
any
cases
in
which
a
similar
thing
happened,
that
the
counsel
said
i'm
going
to
plead
you
guilty
and
the...
the
defendant
doesn't
say
anything,
just
passively
sits
there
as
though,
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even
apart
from
the
competence
of
the
lawyer,
whether
it
shows
adequate
performance
by
the
lawyer,
can't
you...
can't
you
divide
the
boykin
rule,
which
doesn't
relate
to
the
lawyer's
competence
at
all,
into
three
different
categories:
number
one,
where
there
is
express
consent
which
is...
makes
it
okay;
number
two,
when
there's
no
consent
at
all,
which
is
bad;
and
number
three,
where
there
is
what...
what
you
call
here
implicit
consent?
aren't
there
really
three
different
situations?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
assume...
i
assume
your
response
is
that
if
you
eliminate
from
the
boykin
rule
the
possibility
of
implicit
consent,
you
are
forcing
the
lawyer
who
believes
he
has
the
consent
of...
of
a...
an
intractable
client
such
as
this
fellow
who...
who
didn't
go
into
the
courtroom,
took
all
his
clothes
off
so
they
couldn't
take
him
into
the
courtroom.
he
was
obviously
not...
didn't
want
to
be
responsive.
your...
you
would
have
forced
this
lawyer
to
adopt
a
strategy
which
the
lower
court
found
would
have
been
damaging
to
this
defendant,
even
though
the
lawyer
believes
that
the
defendant
really
approved
of
the
strategy
that
the
lawyer
was
undertaking.
why
would
we
want
to
adopt
a
rule
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
if
it
were
a
matter
of
florida
law,
the
florida
legislature
could
change
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
a
matter
of
federal
law,
it
can't.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
agree
with
your
earlier
statement
that
what...
what
this
defendant
expected
was
a
contested
trial
in
which,
you
know,
the
state's
evidence
is
challenged,
blah,
blah,
blah.
that's
to
the
contrary.
he
said
this
whole
thing
is...
is
just
a
big
railroad
job
and
that's
one
reason
i
don't
want
to
be
there.
go
ahead
and
do
whatever
you
want.
he
wasn't...
he
wasn't
expecting...
in
fact,
if
you're...
if
you're
talking
about
is
subjective
expectations,
they
would
reinforce
the
lawyer's
belief
that
he
had
no
objection
to
conceding
guilt
because
he
was
referring
to
this
as...
as
one
big
railroad
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
he
had
made
those
statements
about
being
railroaded
before
he
found
out
about
the
lawyer's
concession.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
correct.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there's
no
difference
between
a
capital
case
and
a
regular
case
insofar
as
the
intelligence
of
that
strategy
is
concerned
because
even
when
there
is
not
a
separate
penalty
phase,
it
is
sometimes
in
the
interest
of
the
defendant
to,
in
effect,
throw
himself
on
the
mercy
of
the
sentencer,
whether
that
is
the
jury
or
the
judge,
by...
by
not
contesting
the...
the
fact
that...
that
he
did
the
acts
charged.
that...
that
occurs
not
just
in
capital
case
but
in...
in
regular
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
but
that's
not
a
problem.
according
to
the
lower
courts,
that
was
a
good
strategy.
i
don't
know
why
you
want
counsel,
when...
when
the
client
doesn't
answer,
to
say,
gee,
i...
you
know,
i
don't
know
whether
he
has
approved
or
disapproved,
i'm
going
to
have
to
take
the
course
that
will
probably
get
him
executed
because
i...
i
haven't
received
an
answer.
why
would
you
force
that
course
on
the...
on
the
lawyer?
if
the
lawyer
believes
that
the
silence
implies
consent,
as...
as
silence
usually
does,
why
not
let
the
lawyer
do
what's
in
the
client's
best
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
nixon...
okay.
you
have
the
inquiry
and
nixon
just
stands
there,
the
same,
doesn't
say
a
thing,
assuming
you
could
get
him
into
the
courtroom,
you
know,
assuming
he
had
put
his
clothes
on
so
you
could
bring
him
into
the
courtroom.
he
just...
he
just
sits
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
you
say,
well,
since
we
don't
have
an
answer,
we
have
to
take
the
course
that's
going
to
get
this
guy
executed.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
much
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
hadn't
there
been
a
hearing
on
those
issues
on
the
way
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no.
we're
talking
below.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
below
on
the
way
up
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
i
assume
that...
that
he
raised
below
the
issue
of
inadequate
performance
of
counsel
and
he
had
his
opportunity
to
introduce
whatever
evidence
he
had
on
that
subject
on
the
way
up
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
the
florida
supreme
court
should
be
obliged
to
remand
it
in
order
to
give
him
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
point
of
whether
there
was,
indeed,
an
opportunity
for
this
defendant
to
introduce
evidence
about
inadequate
performance
of
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
several
opinions
to
announce
today.
first
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
no.
03-931,
florida
versus
nixon
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
