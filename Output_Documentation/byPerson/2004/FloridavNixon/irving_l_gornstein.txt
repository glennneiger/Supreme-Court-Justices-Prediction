mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
most
serious
problem
with
the
florida
supreme
court's
explicit
consent
requirement
is
that
it
prevents
counsel
from
pursuing
what
may
be
the
most
effective
strategy
for
saving
a
defendant's
life,
even
when
counsel
consults
with
the
defendant
on
that
strategy
and
the
defendant
does
not
object.
in
that
situation,
the
florida
supreme
court
would
require
counsel
to
pursue
an
alternative
reasonable
doubt
strategy
even
though
that
might
undermine
the
case
for
sparing
the
defendant's
life
and
even
though
the
defendant
has
not
consented
to
that
strategy
either.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
justice
kennedy.
you
would
still
look
at
that
question
through
the
prism
of
strickland's
reasonableness
inquiry.
it
would
raise
distinct
concerns.
a
reasonable
counsel
would
make
a
reasonable
effort
to
iron
out
differences.
reasonable
counsel
takes
into
account
the
considered
views
of
his
client.
but
if,
at
the
end
of
that
process,
counsel
reasonably
concludes
that
this
is
the
only
effective
strategy
for
saving
the
defendant's
life,
then
the
pursuit
of
that
strategy
is
not
per
se
ineffective.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
kennedy,
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--as...
the
defendant
could
go
to
the...
to
the
judge
and
his
counsel
could
go
to
the
judge
and
say,
we
have
had
such
a
breakdown
between
us
on
what
should
be
done
here,
we
think
alternative
counsel
should
be
appointed.
but
that
would
be
a
discretionary
call
for
the
district
court.
so
too,
the
defendant
could
say,
i
want
to
exercise
my
right
to
self-representation,
which
he
has
a
right
to
do.
so
those
are
the
two
checks
on
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
souter,
this
is
a
situation
where
there
was
no
objection
initially,
the
lawyer
proceeded
to
adopt
a
strategy,
and
then
there
was
a--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that...
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
case
where
there
ought
to
be
alternative
counsel
appointed
if
there
has
been
such
a--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--probably
not,
justice
souter,
that
you
would
analyze
that
under
strickland
and
you
would
find
that
that's
not
the
reasonable
performance
of
counsel
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
so...
but
the
question
here
really
is
what
do
you
do
not
in
a
case
where
there's
been
an
objection,
because
there
was
no
objection
here.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
is
one
factor
that
reasonable
counsel
will
take
into
account,
but
it
is
not
the
only
factor.
in
some
situations,
if
you're
not
following
the
defendant's
instructions,
it
can
lead
to
such
a
breakdown
in
the
attorney-client
relationship
that
you
couldn't
possibly
render
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
so
it
is
going
to
be
a
factor
in
that
respect.
but
this
case
presents
only
the
question
of
what
happens
when
there's
no
objection,
and
when
there's
no
objection,
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
where
there's
been
consultation,
no
objection,
that
instead
of
allowing
the
lawyer
to
exercise
his
reasonable
judgment
on
what
the
best
thing
to
do
is,
he
instead
has
to
pursue
an
alternative
reasonable
doubt
strategy
that
is
less
effective.
and
the
sixth
amendment
simply
can't
be
read
to
require
counsel
to
pursue
a
less
effective
strategy
that
the
defendant
hasn't
asked
for.
now,
there's
no
perfect
analogy
here,
but
the
closest
analogy
is
to
the
division
of
responsibilities
for
appeal
where
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
say
whether
he
will
appeal,
but
counsel
has
the
right
primarily
to
make
the
strategic
judgments
of
what
arguments
will
be
raised
on
appeal.
so
too
here,
the...
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
decide
to
stand
trial,
but
client
has
primary
responsibility
for
making
the
strategic
judgment
of
what
defenses
will
be
raised
at
that
trial.
now,
there
is...
this
is
an
important
question,
and
therefore
there
is
a
duty
on
the
part
of
counsel
to
consult
with
the
defendant,
but
once
that
consultation
has
occurred,
and
there
is
no
objection,
and
the
choice
that
counsel
made
is
a
reasonable,
tactical
judgment
under
all
the
facts
and
circumstances,
his
pursuit
of
that
strategy
satisfies
constitutional
standards.
there
is
no
requirement
of
explicit,
affirmative
consent,
and
the
florida
supreme
court's
judgment
should,
therefore,
be
reversed.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
