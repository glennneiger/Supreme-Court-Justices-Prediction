justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
was...
was
the
attorney's
essential
concession
of
guilt
sort
of
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
yes,
he
clearly
tried
to
preserve
a
role
in
the
sentencing,
but
we
often
have
guilty
pleas
and
then
leave
the
sentencing
to
be
determined.
was...
was
what
he
did
concerning
the
guilt/innocence
phase
the
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there
any
cross
examination
of
witnesses
conducted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
do
you
think
that
it's
possible
that
in
some
instances
it
is
a
valid
strategy
to
focus
on
the
punishment/sentencing
phase
rather
than
the
guilt
phase
if
the
lawyer
has
reviewed
all
the
evidence
and
it
appears
to
the
lawyer
to
be
overwhelming?
is
it
possible
that
there's
a
case
where
a
strategy
such
as
this
might
make
sense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
possible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
possible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now
you're
building
in
something
that
i
didn't
ask.
i'm
asking
you
if
it
is
possible
that
the
better
strategy
for
a
defendant
in
a
given
case
would
be
to
focus
on
the
sentencing
rather
than
the
guilt
phase
based
on
an
evaluation
by
the
attorney
of
the
evidence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
we
think
that's
not
correct,
that
it
is
not
the
equivalent
of
a
guilty
plea?
there
was
some
cross
examination.
there
was
some
participation.
so
if
we
don't
accept
your
statement
that
it
is
the
functional
equivalent,
then
what
standard
do
we
employ
for
the
tacit
consent
or
the
failure
to
affirmatively
respond?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
said
we
could
affirm
if
we
applied
cronic,
but
i
thought
the
issue
was
whether
perhaps
strickland
applied,
and
if
strickland
applies,
i
wouldn't
think
we'd
be
affirming
necessarily.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the...
the
question
of
which
standard
applies
i
thought
was
before
the
court.
was
it
correct
for
the
florida
supreme
court
to
employ
the
cronic
standard
or
should
it
have
reviewed
it
under
strickland?
is
that
not
before
us?
is
that
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--one
of
the
questions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
thank
you.
