ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
trial
court
violated
carman
deck's
rights
to
due
process
and
a
fair
and
reliable
sentencing
proceeding,
as
guaranteed
by
the
sixth,
eighth,
and
fourteenth
amendments,
when
the
trial
court
forced
him
to
appear
handcuffed
to
a
belly
chain
and
shackled
in
legirons
before
the
jury
which
would
determine
whether
he
was
to
live
or
to
die.
counsel
objected
to
the
restraints
and
filed
a
motion
asking
for
the
procedures
set
forth
by
this
court
in
holbrook
v.
flynn.
holbrook
described
shackling
as
an
inherently
prejudicial
practice
and
set
forth
a
procedure
by
which
courts
would
exercise
their
discretion
in
maintaining
courtroom
security
while
protecting
the
rights
of
the
defendant.
if
the
court
is
to
impose
an
inherently
prejudicial
practice
like
shackling,
it
first
must
determine
that
the
shackles
are
necessary
to
further
an
essential
state
interest
specific
to
the
trial
and
must
find
that
no
lesser
means
is
available
to
meet
those
state
interests.
the
court
abused
its
discretion
in
failing
to
apply
the
holbrook
standard
in
penalty
phase.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
counsel
had
filed
an
extensive
motion
in
which
it
set
forth
a
number
of
different
ways
in
which
courts
in
missouri
and
in
other
jurisdictions
had
dealt
with
the
problem
where
the...
where
the
courts
minimized
the
effect
of
the
shackles
on
the
jury
by
hiding
them
from
view
such
as
by
placing
boxes
around
counsel
table,
ensuring
that
the
defendant
was
already
in
place
in
the
courtroom
before
the
jurors
entered,
that
sort
of
thing.
and
the
court
summarily
overruled
that
motion.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
the
court
did
not
establish
a
record
for
why
the
shackles
were...
were
warranted.
the
only
justification
that
the
court
gave
was...
at
this
penalty
phase
retrial
was
that
deck
had
been
convicted,
but
there's
nothing
else
in
the
record
as
to
what
justification
the
court
had.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
there's
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
security
officers
in
the
courtroom.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
once
defense
conviction
objects
to
the
use
of
shackling,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
show
that
the
restraints
were
harmless,
and
by
doing
so,
they
would
need
to
make
a
record
that--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--well,
it's
basically
chapman
because
shackling
is
an
inherently
prejudicial
procedure,
and
when
the
court
imposes
that
without
justification,
the
burden
falls
on
the
state
to
show
that
it
was,
in
fact,
justified
or
that
the
shackling
was...
was
harmless
and
that
the
jurors
could
not
see
it
or
that
sort
of
thing.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
yes.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
no,
it
would
not
be
in
chapman.
it
would...
it's...
it
flows
from
holbrook
and
illinois
v.
allen
and
estelle
v.
williams.
those
cases
set
up
the
standard
that
is
really
enunciated
in
holbrook.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
yes,
and--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--the
reason
that
this
presumption
applies
in
penalty
phase
as
well,
the
presumption
of...
that
shackles
are
inherently
prejudice,
it
stems
from...
we
could
start
the
analysis
in
guilt
phase.
in
guilt
phase,
courts
have
held
that
shackles
are
inherently
prejudicial
because
they
make
the
defendant
appear--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--dangerous,
violent,
untrustworthy,
and
then
hence,
they
are
more
likely
to
be
guilty.
notably
in...
in
guilt
phase,
there's
no
question
as
to
character.
in
penalty
phase,
however,
where
the
state
still
has
a
burden
of
establishing
that
the
defendant
is
worthy
of
a
death
sentence
by
evidence
presented
in
court,
the
question
of
character
is
a
key
factor
that
the
jury
considers.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
counsel
filed
a
motion
saying
that
there
should
not
be
restraints
at
all,
but
within
that
motion,
he
explained
how
courts
in
missouri
had
accommodated--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--both
interests
successfully.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
yes,
yes.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
well,
i
think
that
you
could
follow
holbrook
pretty
closely
and
that
i
think
what
you'd
need
to...
to
deal
with
is
there's
a
whole
bunch
of
precedent
regarding
how
prejudicial
shackling
is.
we
know
that
character
is
essential
in
penalty
phase,
and
the
other
characteristic
of
penalty
phase
is
the
heightened
for
reliability
which
is
not
present
in
the
guilt
phase.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
we
know
that
on
that
day
7
years
prior
that
carman
deck
was
dangerous
to
those
people
in
that
situation.
but
what
the
jury
is
being
asked
to
consider
is
whether
his
acts
on
that
day
were
really
in
conformity
with
what
his
character
is
and
what
it...
how
he
would
behave
if
he
were
sentenced
to
life
without
parole.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
well,
your
honor,
in
beck
v.
alabama,
a
similar
situation
arose.
in
beck,
the
question
was
whether
alabama's
statute
which
prohibited
the
jury
from
getting
lesser
included
offense
instructions
in
a
first
degree
murder
case
was
constitutional.
and
justice
stevens
in
his
opinion
writing
for
the
court
stated
that
there
may
be
factors
that
cut
in
favor
of
the
defendant
and
factors
that
cut
against
the
defendant,
but
the
uncertainty
and
unreliability
that
is
forced
into
the
fact-finding
process
is
what
the
problem
is.
so
as
in
this
situation,
perhaps
some
jurors
would...
would
think,
you
know,
he's
wearing
these
shackles
just
because
he
was
convicted.
others
might...
may,
as
well,
say
he's
wearing
them
because
he's
particularly
dangerous.
we
don't
know,
and
there's
that
unreliability
of
the...
the
fact-finding
process
since
the
defense
has
not
been
able
to
confront
this
evidence
and
it
hasn't
come
in
from
the
stand.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
well,
there
are
statutory
aggravating
circumstances,
and
the
jurors
are
also
allowed
to
consider
non-statutory
evidence.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
it
is
not
a
specific
aggravating
circumstance,
but
it's
something
that
is...
is
certainly
relevant
and
that
the
jurors
can
consider.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
well--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--well,
there
are
certainly
other
considerations
that
shackling
affects.
shackling
impedes
participation
in
the
trial
by
affecting
how
the
client
can
communicate
with
counsel
and
that
sort
of
thing,
how
the
jurors
will
gauge
his
demeanor,
whether
his
mental
faculties
will
be
diminished
through
the
shackling.
our
argument
here...
because
counsel
did
not
specifically
object
on
grounds
of
right
to
be
present,
our
argument
here
focuses
on
how
the
jury
viewed
the
defendant,
given
the
fact
that
he
was
in
these...
this
extreme
form
of
restraints,
and
these
extreme
restraints
were
unjustified.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
no,
he
would
not
be
unless
he
was
a
very
disorderly
inmate
or
something
like
that,
but
i
think
most
of
the
jurors
would...
would
know
from
seeing
jail
shows
and
jail
movies
that
inmates
are
typically
not
restrained
in
that
fashion
so
that--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--no,
i
am
not,
your
honor.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
no.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
well,
i
think...
i
don't
think
there's
other
considerations
other
than,
you
know,
this
is
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
trial
where
we
have
to
have
the
reliability
of
the
fact-finding
process.
and
the
jurors
are
gauging
the
character
of
this
defendant.
and
as
you
mentioned
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
riggins,
the
jury
is
searching
to
discover
the
heart
and
mind
of
this
defendant,
and
considerations
such
as
character
or
future
dangerousness
are
very
important
and
may,
in
fact,
be
determinative
of
what
sentence
the
defendant
receives.
shackling
a
defendant
basically
places
a
thumb
on
death's
side
of
the
scale
and
dehumanizes
the
defendant,
making
it
easier
for
the
jury
to
find
that
he
is
worthy
of
a
death
sentence.
the
holbrook
standard
that
this
court
established
is
a
great
standard.
it
has
been
in
effect
for...
for
decades
and
it
works.
it
is
efficient
and
it
is
just
as
easily
applied
in
penalty
phase.
holbrook
promotes
the
reliability
of
a
death
determination
by
limiting
the
risk
that
impermissible
considerations
will
come
into
play.
it
also
allows
consideration
of
the
individual
circumstances
of
the
case
that
is
so
crucial
in
the
penalty
phase.
holbrook--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--because
we
are
concerned
with
the
reliability
of
the
death
sentence.
if...
if
shackles
are
inherently
prejudicial
in
guilt
phase
where
character
isn't
even
at
issue
and
that
has
a
lesser
standard
of
reliability,
then
they
certainly
are
inherently
prejudicial
in
the
guilt...
in
the
penalty
phase
where
the
defendant's
life
is
at
stake.
and
as
justice
o'connor
has
recognized
in
her
concurrence
in
the
eddings
v.
oklahoma
case,
this
court
goes
to
extraordinary
measures
to
ensure
that
the
defendant
sentenced
to
be
executed
is
afforded
process
that
will
guarantee,
as
much
as
humanly
possible,
that
the
sentence
was
not
imposed
out
of
whim,
passion,
prejudice,
or
mistake.
shackling
opens
the
door
to
prejudice
and
mistake
by
giving
the
jury
the
impression
that
the
defendant
is
particularly
dangerous
and
therefore
worthy
of
a
death
sentence.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
this
court
in
holbrook
dealt
with
the
same
situation,
and
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
when
a
procedure
presents
such
a
probability
of
prejudice
that
it
is
inherently
lacking
in
due
process,
little
stock
need
be
placed
in
jurors'
claims
to
the
contrary
because
jurors
may
not
even
be
conscious
of
the
effects
that
shackling
will
have.
and
at
that
point
in
the
proceedings,
the
jurors
had
not
been
instructed
as
to
what
specific
factors
they
would
be
looking
at.
they
did
not
know
that
missouri
has
four
steps
in
their
sentencing
procedure.
they
did
not
know
how
this
would
play
into
it.
so
their
response
that
they
would
not
be
affected
really
should
have
little
bearing
here.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
no,
i
don't
think
it
would.
i
guess
what
you're
saying
is
if
the
jurors
believe
that
the
shackling
is
done
for
their
protection.
then
that
gives
the
jurors
the
idea
that...
that
this
man
is
going
to...
has
done
something
to
indicate--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--yes,
it
is.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
yes.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
no.
i--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--i
would
not
be
here
arguing
that
if
the
court
had
gone
to...
had...
had
balanced
both
interests
and
had
limited
the
risk
that
this
impermissible
factor
would
come
into
play.
and
in
fact,
at
the
first
trial
and
penalty
phase,
deck
wore
leg
braces
underneath
his
clothing
and
he
behaved
perfectly
fine.
it
was
only
when
he
came
back
on--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--no,
it
was
not.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
well,
that...
that
is
one
of
the
problems
with
excessive
shackling.
i
think
with...
with
leg
braces...
there's...
there's
a
balance
with...
with
holbrook.
and
the
court
is
balancing
the
state's
interests
and
courtroom
security
with
the
defendant's
interest
in
a
fair
trial.
the
leg
braces
was
an
effective
balance
because
it
protected
the
courtroom
security,
but
it
also
enabled
deck
to
be
judged
on...
just
on
the
evidence
presented
in
court
and
to
have
the
freedom
necessary
to--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--no,
your
honor.
no.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
well,
there
are
two
different
angles
on
that.
first,
there's
the
ability
to
communicate
with
counsel,
such
as
by
taking
notes.
the
other
aspect
is
if
the
shackles
are
so
distracting
to
the
defendant
or
causing
him
pain
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
concentrate
on
what
is
going
on
at
the
trial
to
enable
him
to
help
his
attorney
and
participate.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
if
the
shackles
are...
are
very
obvious,
it
might
deter
the
defendant
from
coming
to
court
in
the
first
place,
lest
he
be
characterized
as
this
dangerous
person.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
i
cannot
cite
to
any
right
now,
your
honor.
but--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--yes,
when
the--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--yes.
when
the
judge
comes
in,
when
the
jury
comes
in,
the
defendant
would
stand
up.
and
so--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--yes.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
yes,
it
is.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
it
could
also
prevent
him
from
testifying
if
he
knows
that
he
would
need
to
walk
from
defense
table
up
to
the
witness
box.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
that...
you're
right,
your
honor.
but
there's
other
measures
that
the
court
could
take
to
ensure
that
the
defendant
was
in
place
at
the
witness
box
before
the
jury
would
come
in.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
but
in
this
case
the
judge
took
no
remedial
measures.
the
judge
was
perfectly
satisfied
by
the
fact
that
the
jury
could
see
these
restraints.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
right.
when--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--yes.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
well--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--okay.
that
incident--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--i...
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
in
this
case
because
that
incident
had
happened
well
prior
to
the
first
trial,
and
at
the
first
trial,
he
was
wearing
the
leg
braces
underneath
his
clothing
and
they
sufficed.
deck
was
a
perfectly
calm,
orderly
defendant
in
the
courtroom.
there
were
no
problems.
and
so
there's
two
issues.
there's
the
issue
of
whether
the
shackles
were
warranted
and
then
whether
the...
they
were
excessive.
and
these...
handcuffing
him
to
a
belly
chain
and
forcing
him
to
wear
legirons
were
excessive.
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor?
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
yes,
your
honor.
this
constitutional
violation
was
not
harmless
for
a
number
of
reasons.
for
one,
character
was
the
key
consideration
in
the
jury's
analysis
of
whether
this
person
should
live
or
die.
the
court
is
saying
that
even
7
years
after
this
crime
occurred,
that
carman
deck
is
so
dangerous
that
he
needs
to
be
in
both
belly
chain
and
legirons
to
keep
the
courtroom
safe,
to
keep
him
there.
the
court
is
saying
that
he's
dangerous
in
the
courtroom,
that
he
remains
dangerous
and
therefore
he--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
and
that's
because
there's...
that
is
the...
just
the
first
step
of
the
missouri
procedure.
the
jury
then
goes
to
step
two,
by
which
they
look
at
both
statutory
aggravators
and
nonstatutory
aggravators
to
decide
whether
death
is
warranted.
at
step
three,
they
then
weigh
the
mitigation
against
the
aggravation.
the
missouri
supreme
court
itself
in
the
first
appeal
stated
that
deck
had
presented
substantial
mitigation
about
his
horribly
abusive
childhood.
and
it's
not
accurate
that
the
defense
was
only
related
to
his...
his
childhood.
in
closing
arguments,
defense
counsel
repeatedly
argued
that
deck
deserved
to
be
in
prison
because
of
what
he
had
done,
but
that
he
would
be
safe
in
prison.
there
would
be
no
risk
that
he
would
hurt
anybody
else.
so
that
was
part
of
the
defense
strategy.
these
restraints
were--
ms.
rosemary
e.
percival
--this
trial.
he
made
that
argument
at
this
trial.
these
restraints
were
visible
throughout
the
trial.
there
were
15
recesses,
at
which
time
deck
would
have
had
to
stand
up
when
both
the
jurors
leave
the
court
and
come
back
in.
the
shackles
dehumanized
deck
and
it
degraded
the
dignity
of
the
courtroom.
prison
clothing
does
not
relate
to
character,
and
shackles
directly
relate
to
character,
which
is
so
key
in
the
death
analysis.
it
was
not
reasonable
to
impose
these
excessive
restraints
after
deck
had
behaved
appropriately
at...
at
numerous
proceedings
prior
to
this.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
find
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation--
