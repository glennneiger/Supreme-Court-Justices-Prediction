justice
antonin
scalia
who...
who
should...
whose
responsibility
should
it
be
to
get
something
like
that
into
the
record?
i
mean,
i
read
it.
i
don't...
i
have
no
idea
whether
there
was
a
good
reason
for
the
shackling
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
those...
those
are
all,
are
they
not,
cases
involving
the...
the
guilt
phase
of...
of
a
trial?
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
a
little
different.
he...
i
mean,
when
you
shackle
somebody
who
hasn't
yet
been
convicted,
you...
you
send
a
message
to
the
jury
that,
you
know,
this...
this
person
belongs
in
irons.
but
the
jury
had
already
found
this
person
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was...
he
was
convicted.
justice
antonin
scalia
should
that
make
no
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
can...
can
i
ask
you?
you
say
counsel
proposed
some
alternatives
to...
to
the
visible
shackling.
did
counsel
object
that
there
shouldn't
have
been
any
shackling
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
did
take
the
position
that
there
was
no
need
for
shackles
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
that
it's
as...
as
prejudicial
in
the...
in
the
penalty
phase
as
it
is
in
the
guilt
phase?
i
mean,
in
the
guilt
phase,
it
does
make
the
person
look
like
a
criminal.
in
the
penalty
phase,
i...
i'm
really
not
sure
if
i...
if
i
were
a
prosecutor
whether
i
would
prefer
to
have
the
defendant
shackled
or
not.
the
issue
before
the
jury
is
whether
to
leave
this
person
in
his...
in
his
current
incarcerated
state
for
life
or
to
execute
him.
and
i...
i
might
think
that
showing,
you
know,
what...
what
kind
of
an
existence
it
is
to
be...
to
be
a
life
prisoner
walking
around
with
the
legirons
and
chains...
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
going
to
cut
in
favor
of
the
jury's
giving
the
death
penalty
or...
or
to
the
contrary,
make
the
juror
think,
boy,
what
a
wretched
life
this
is
and...
and
that
ought
to
be
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
still
an
oppressive
reminder
of...
of
how
this
individual,
if
sentenced
to
life,
is...
is
subject
to...
to
the
orders
of
prison
authorities
which
on
some
occasions
will
subject
him
to
this
kind
of
restraint.
i...
once
again,
if
i
were
a
prosecutor,
i'd
rather
have
him
dressed
up
in
a
nice,
new
suit
and
his
hair
combed
and
smiling.
i
would
much
prefer
that
to
having
him
in
shackles.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
gather
there
was
some
evidence
or
perhaps
it's
conceded
that
he
was
put
on
a
suicide
watch
before
his
first
trial.
this
was
the
second
trial.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
he
had
been
put
on
a
suicide
watch
and
that
he
had
tried
to
injure
himself
by
knocking
his
head
against
the
cell
wall?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if...
what
if
the
judge
had
specifically
stated
i'm
putting
him
in
irons
because
the
man
is...
is
violent
enough
towards
himself
or
others
that
i'm
worried
about
the
safety
of
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
judge
had
said
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
have
been
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
limit
it
to
double
murderers
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
nield,
is...
is
the
state
making
a
harmless
error
argument
here?
i
really
couldn't
tell
from
your
brief
whether
you're
doing
it
or
not.
are...
are...
is
the
state
asserting
that
assuming
it...
assuming
it
was
wrong,
assuming
it
was
a
violation,
this
jury
would
have...
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
specific
aggravating
circumstances
did
they
jury
find?
you
say
there
are
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
in
missouri.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
jury
found...
there
are
five.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
jury
found
all
five.
justice
antonin
scalia
six.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
answer
his
question.
give
him
an
example
of
where
it...
it
wouldn't
be
harmless
error.
justice
antonin
scalia
assuming
that
it
is
a
violation,
what's
an
example
of
where
it
wouldn't
be
harmless
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
i
suppose
if
future
dangerousness
was
a
specific
aggravating
factor
under
state
law,
as
it
is
in
texas,
for
example--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then...
then
you
would
concede
that
if
this
was
unlawful,
the
error
clearly
would
not
be
harmless.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
at
this
trial
or
at
the
first
trial,
that--
