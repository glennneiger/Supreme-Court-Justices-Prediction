justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
deck
against
the
state
of
missouri.
ms.
percival.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
aware
of
any
cases
in
which
prosecutors
have
objected
to
shackling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
justice
scalia
would
have,
i
suppose,
but
he's
unusual
as
a
prosecutor
i
think.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
may,
ms.
percival.
ms.
nield.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
position
would
be
precisely
the
same
if
the
record
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
jury
could
see
everything,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
is
an
alternative
argument
that
you're
making.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
fact
of
conviction
critical
for
your
point
of
view
because
it
doesn't
really
matter
if
there's
prejudice
or
that
because
there's
no...
no
danger
of
prejudice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
concede
that
even
though
he
had
been
convicted,
it
would,
nevertheless,
be
prejudicial
in
the
eyes
of
the
jury
to
see
a
man
shackled
when
one
of
the
issues
they'll
have
to
decide
is
whether
his
future
dangerousness
might...
might
justify
his
execution?
do
you
think
there
is
prejudice
there,
or
do
you
share
justice
scalia's
view
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it
depends,
why
would
it
not
be
appropriate
to
have
a
rule
that
the
trial
judge
should
be
required
to
explain
the
basis
for
his
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
would
you
not
agree
that
it's
always
of
relevance
to
a
jury
in
deciding
whether
the...
the
man
should
be
executed,
is
how
dangerous
is
this
guy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is
much
like
arguing
on
the
merits
of
the...
at
the
original
trial
that
his
defense
was
alibi
or
something
like
that,
therefore
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
prejudice
that
arises
from
the
restraints.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
bottom
line
from
the
other
point
of
view
is
that
shackles
are
always
prejudicial,
and
you
try
to
have
the
scales
evenly
balanced
when
you're
deciding
whether
the
man
should
die
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
were
the
facts
of
the
aiding
escape?
was
he
trying
to
get
away
or
was
he
helping
somebody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
really
has
very
little
probative
value
on
this
issue.
i
mean,
the
fact
that
he
tried
to
saw
his
way
out
of
a
cell
hardly
speaks
to
the
risk
of
fleeing
from
the
courtroom
while
the
proceedings
are
going
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms.
nield.
ms.
percival,
you
have
about
4
and
a
half
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
quick
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
how
big
he
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
the
case
is
submitted.
