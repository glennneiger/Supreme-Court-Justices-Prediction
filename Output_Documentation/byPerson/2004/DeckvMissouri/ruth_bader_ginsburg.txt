justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the...
did
counsel
suggest
less
intrusive
restraints?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
prison
setting,
does
he
wear
such
restraints?
justice
scalia
suggested
the
jury
might
say,
wow,
that's
the
way
he
has
to
go
around
the
rest
of
his
life
with
the...
all
chained
up.
but
in...
do
we
know
whether
in
the
prison
he
would
be
routinely
wearing
these
restraints?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
make
of
the
judge...
well,
the
jury,
already
having
been
polled,
and
every
one
of
them
said
this
would
not
affect
our
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
does
have
to
stand
up
when
the
judge
comes
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
presumably
when
the
jury
files
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this...
this
is
given...
i
mean,
this
is
legirons.
it's
not
leg
braces.
belly
chain.
you
don't
need
to
make
a
record
to...
to
know
that
those
things
are
visible.
is
there
any
serious
doubt
that
they
were
visible?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
no
for
example
here
because
the
court
said,
in
answer
to
the
lawyer's
objection...
the...
the
lawyer
says,
it
prejudiced
him...
prejudices
him
toward
the
jury
and
it
makes
him
look
dangerous.
the
court's
answer:
the
objection
you're
making
will
be
overruled.
he
has
been
convicted
and
will
remain
in
legirons
and
belly
chain.
the
only
thing
that
was
relevant,
according
to
the
trial
judge
was
he
has
been
convicted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
he
went
through
the
entire
guilt
phase
with
the
more
moderate
restraints,
just
the
leg
brace,
and
there
was
no
incident.
there
was
no
disturbance
in
that
trial.
he
didn't
try
to
lash
out
at
anyone.
why
wasn't
that
the
best
example
of
what
one
could
anticipate
in
the
penalty
phase?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
why
the
judge
apparently
changed
his
mind?
because
if
i
remember
correctly,
at
the
pretrial
hearing,
the
court
said
that
the
defendant
would
be
allowed
to,
a,
wear
his
own
clothes
and,
b,
to
have
leg
braces
underneath
for
security.
and
then
sometime
after
that
pretrial
hearing,
the
judge
apparently
changed
his
mind.
do
we
know
what
triggered
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
already
know
that...
that
that
effort
was
made
before
he
was
tried
in
the
guilt
phase.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
whatever
inference
you
might
draw,
it
didn't
prove
out.
so
it
seems
to
me
the...
the
closest
in
time
is
the...
and...
and
in
fact
is
the
episode
he's
just
been
through,
the
trial
episode.
so
why
wouldn't
that
be...
the...
the
judge
would
start
with
that
in
mind.
well,
i
tried
this
man
and
he
didn't
give
me
any
problems,
so
i
have
no
reason
to
anticipate
problems
now.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
a...
with
a
blank
record...
the...
the
state
is
going
to
restrain
someone
and
it
may
be
necessary,
it
may
be
not,
and
if
the
state
has
the
burden,
then
why
shouldn't
a
reviewing
court
speculate
on
what
might
have
been
when
the
only
thing
that
was...
appears
of
record
is
he's
been
convicted
and
will
remain
in
legirons?
the
only
reason
the
court
gave
is
that
now
things
have
changed.
he's
no
longer
in
the
guilt
phase
where
he
enjoys
the
presumption
of
innocence.
he
has
been
convicted
and,
therefore,
we
can
keep
him
in
chains.
there's
nothing
situation-specific
about
it.
the
judge
seems
to
be
saying
once
a
person
is
convicted,
at
least
of
murder,
it's
fair
game.
it's...
it's
permissible
to
keep
him
in
legirons
and
shackles.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
question
here
was,
was
he
dangerous
in
the
courtroom?
was
he
going
to
lash
out
at
a
witness
or
try
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
he...
if
he
were
kept
under
these
restraints,
legirons
and
the...
what
do
they
call
it...
belly
chain,
day
in
and
day
out
in
prison,
would
that
constitute
cruel
or
unusual
punishment?
