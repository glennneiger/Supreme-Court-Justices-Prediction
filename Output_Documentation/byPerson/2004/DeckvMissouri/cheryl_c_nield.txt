ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
missouri
and
mr.
deck
agree
that
the
trial
court
needs
discretion
to
fashion
security
measures
such
as
restraints.
that's
particularly
so
in
a
case
like
this
where
we're
talking
about
a
penalty
phase.
mr.
deck,
at
the
time
of
his
penalty
phase
retrial,
had
already
been
convicted,
among
other
things,
of
two
counts
of
murder.
so
by
definition,
he
was
a
dangerous
individual.
in
those
circumstances--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--that
is
part
of
the
question.
that
is
true.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
well,
i
think
that
certainly
suggests
that
he's
dangerous
right
off.
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
he's
dangerous
in
the
courtroom,
there's
other
facts
that
are
conspicuous
upon
this
record.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
there
may
be
but
prior
to
that,
there...
there
should
be
a
burden
on
the
defendant
to,
first
of
all,
articulate
that
the
restraints
are
visible
and
make
a
record
on
that.
and
second
of
all,
to--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--i
think
i
disagree
with
the
characterization.
there
was
a
motion
filed
pretrial
that
contained
a
lengthy
discussion
of
the
law,
which
included
discussion
of
various
cases
and
alternatives
to
restraint
that
had
been
used.
but
that
said,
the
motion
itself
is
styled
motion
to
have
accused
appear
at
trial
free
of
restraints.
the
relief
requested
was
that
mr.
deck
should
appear
free
of
restraints
both--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--it...
it
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
restraints,
but
if
the
restraints
are
not
visible--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--right.
if
not
visible,
then
that
would
be
fine.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
certainly
that
would
be
fine.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
again,
it...
it
depends
upon
the
circumstances,
but
if
they're
not
visible
to
the
jury,
the
defendant
has
a
difficult
time--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--a
traffic
offender
who
is
restrained
where
it's
not
visible--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--yes,
it
is.
yes,
it
is
because
if
the
jury
doesn't
see
them,
then--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--that's
true,
but
it
points
up
the
importance
of
making
a
record
on
the
visibility.
if
they
are
not
visible--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--well,
i...
i
think
there
was
serious
doubt
and
that's
borne
out
by
defense
counsel's
question
to
the
voir
dire.
he
said
to
the...
during
the
voir
dire
to
the
panel,
you
either
do
or
will
know
that
mr.
deck
is
restrained,
and
i
guess
that's
what
happens
when
you're
convicted.
that's
a
rough
paraphrase.
but
the
either...
the
part
that
he
said,
you
either
do
or
will
know,
that's
a
direct
quote.
so
defense
counsel
himself
was
not
even
necessarily--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--one
of
them.
that's
true.
and
there
was
a
gentleman--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--again,
we--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--i
think
that's
an
allegation
by
counsel
that
that
may
be
the
case.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
well,
recall
at...
at
this
point
the
sequence
is
critical.
by
this
time,
defense
counsel
in
his
voir
dire
questioning
had
already
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag.
either
you
do
or
will
know
that
he's
restrained.
but
by--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--yes.
i'm
taking
the
position
that
we
don't
know
from
this
record
that
they
were
visible.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
that's
right.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
i
do
not.
i
do
not
concede
it.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
i
think
the
test
would
be
the
same.
that's--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--that's
true.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
that's
true.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
well,
this
points
up
the
distinction
in
this
case
between
guilt
phase
and
penalty
phase.
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
and
the
rule
that
i
am
urging
this
court
to
adopt
relates
to
the
penalty
phase.
and
in
the
penalty
phase,
like
mr.
deck's,
we
have
a
person
who's
been
convicted
of
murder.
now,
in
a
guilt
phase,
certainly
there
are
issues
of
presumption--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--i
think
he
possibly
would
be
able
to,
yes.
yes,
i
do
because
prison
clothes
identify
the
defendant,
and
if
a
defendant
is
an
escape
risk,
for
example,
that
would
identify
the
defendant
in
case
he
were
to
bolt
from
the
courtroom,
for
example.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
that
is
the
only
stated
reason,
that
he
has
been
convicted.
i
think
what
that
means
is
he's
a
twice
convicted
murderer.
of
course,
he's
dangerous.
further,
there
are
reasons
spread
upon
this
record.
and
keep
in
mind
the
same
judge
from
the
penalty
phase
retrial
has
been
with
this
case
from
the
beginning.
there
are
reasons
spread
upon
this
record
that
justify
additionally
the
use
of
restraints
against
mr.
deck.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
what
you
state
is
true,
but
by
the
time
of
the
penalty
phase
retrial,
mr.
deck's
position,
to
paraphrase
from
martinez
v.
court
of
appeal,
had
changed
dramatically.
he
had
already
been
convicted.
add
to
that
he
had
already
pursued
his
direct
appeal
through
the
missouri
supreme
court.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
i
think
it
would
depend.
some
jurors
might
take
away
that
the
person--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--certainly
here
it
would
have
been
simpler
had
the
trial
court
been
a
little
wordier,
and
that's
not
the
case.
that
said,
i
think
the
test
should
be,
looking
back,
has
the
trial
court
done
something
that's
reasonable.
and
then
to
get
into
the
prejudice
issue,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case.
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
the
restraint
could
prejudice
mr.
deck,
one
thing
to
look
at
is
the
defense
that
he
offered
in
mitigation.
his
defense
in
mitigation
was
not
that
he
was
not
a
dangerous
individual.
it
was
not
that
these
murders
were
an
aberration--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--yes,
certainly
juries
can
consider
that,
and
jury
case
law
is
in
accord.
but
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
mr.
deck's
defense
in
mitigation
was
not
that
he
was
a
safe
individual
or,
again,
that
the
murder
of
these
two
people
was
an
aberration
in
an
otherwise
saintly
life.
that's
not
the
case.
the
mitigation
defense
was
that
he
did
these
horrible
things.
he
is
some...
a
nefarious
individual,
but
that
he
should
not
be
sentenced
to
death
because
that
wasn't
his
fault.
it
was
his
parents'
fault.
they
had
done
a
poor
job
in
raising
him.
he
had
suffered
difficult
circumstances
growing
up.
so
there's
simply
no
intersection
between
the
mitigation
defense
offered
here
and
whatever
the
jury
might
take
away
that
might
be
negative
from
the
fact
that
he
was
restrained.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
could
they
put
mr.
deck
in
a
cage?
i
don't
think
so.
could
they
put--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--right.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
well,
i
think
in
the
penalty
phase,
we're
looking
at
reliability.
and...
and
the
bottom
line
is
restraining
somebody
who's
twice
been
convicted
of
murder
is
not
in
any
way
unreliable
or
misleading.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
in
terms
of
making
that
decision,
it's
important
to
remember
that
missouri
has
procedures
in
place
to
channel,
at
the
front
end,
the
jury's
decision
whether
or
not
to
impose
death.
among
those
are
aggravating
circumstances.
and
in
this
case
the
aggravating
circumstances
did
not
relate
at
all
to
dangerousness
or
future
dangerousness.
in
fact,
in
missouri--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--two
responses
to
that.
in
terms
of
the
dangerousness,
again,
this
jury
in
particular
knew
that
mr.
deck
had
been
convicted
of
murder.
they
knew
that
the
choice
they
faced
was
both
stark
and
very
serious:
life
without
probation
or
parole
or
death.
and
so
to
present
mr.
deck
in
restraints
could
hardly
come
as
a
shock.
to
the
contrary,
it
might
be
confusing
and
cause
consternation
to
have
a
twice-convicted
murderer
sitting
at
counsel
table
no
more
restrained
than
counsel
or
the
people
in
the
courtroom.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
we...
we
do
not.
there
is
no
record
of
any
such
pretrial
hearing.
the
only
way
we
know
about
that
is
from
allegations
in
the
motion
for
new
trial.
so
there
is...
there
is
no
record
on
that
at
all.
if
possible,
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
the
cage
question,
justice
kennedy,
that
you
posed.
that's
a...
that's
an
extreme
form
of
restraint.
could
that
ever
be
used
in
a
case?
it's
possible.
but
then
i
think
we
get
into
questions
of
whether
or
not
the
trial
court's
action
was
reasonable.
and
in
looking
at
reasonableness,
we
can
consider
are
there
other
perhaps
less
visible,
less
dramatic
forms
of
restraint
that
might
do
the
job
equally
well.
that's
not
to
say,
however,
that
a--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--i
think
it
was
an
alternative
in
this
case,
and
the
defense
didn't
proffer,
at
the
time
of
the
objection,
anything
that
they
thought
that
might
be
less.
and
i
think
the
trouble
comes
in
here...
again,
i
don't
believe
a
least
restrictive
alternatives
approach
is
appropriate,
but
when
you
talk
about
least
restrictive,
i
think
it's
sometimes
difficult
to
tell
what
is
less
restrictive
than
something
else
because
not
all
restraints--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--i
think--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--well,
i
think
if
it's
non-visible
restraints--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--i...
i
don't
think
that's--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--no.
i
don't
think
that's
precisely
right.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
i
think
if
it's
non-visible
restraints,
we
have
a
non-issue.
if
the
jury
doesn't
see
it,
it
doesn't
really
matter.
that's...
that's--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--the
burden
is
for
the
state
to
show
that
the
restraints
were
reasonable,
were
not
completely
out
of
proportion--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--the
record--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--there
was
not
a
finding
per
se,
but
the
facts
of
this
case,
spread
upon
the
record,
support
the
use
of
restraints
in
this
case.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
yes.
mr.
deck
had
an
aiding
escape
conviction
that
was
presented
to
the
jury.
there
was
the
attempted
escape
that
justice
scalia
referred
to.
or
excuse
me.
he
referred
to
the...
the
suicide--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--that
had,
yes.
yes,
that's
true.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
he
was
assisting
somebody.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
he...
he
had
a
saw
blade
and
he
assisted
these
other
individuals
in
sawing
their
way
out.
so
there's
that,
both
a
conviction--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--i...
i
must
disagree.
i
think
if
he's
aiding
other
people
in
escape,
he
himself
tried
to
remove
the
glass
from
the
window
when
he
was
held
in
jail
prior
to
trial
by
removing
the
caulking.
if
he
is
willing
to
escape
in
those
circumstances,
what's
to
say
he's
not
willing
to
escape
in
the
jefferson
county
courtroom?
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
that's
true.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
that's
true.
but
again,
we
also
have
the
fact
that
he
had...
between
the
initial
penalty
phase
and
the
penalty
phase
retrial,
mr.
deck
had
pursued
his
direct
and
post-conviction
appeals.
they
had
not
been
successful
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
the
issue
of
guilt
is
done.
he's
a
twice-convicted
murderer.
and
he
knew
that
at
that
time.
furthermore,
we
have
the
fact
that
the
first
jury
in
the
penalty
phase
found
one
of
the
six
aggravating
circumstances...
actually
they
found
all,
but
one
of
them
was
that
mr.
deck
killed
in
order
to
avoid
lawful
arrest.
he
has
12
convictions
on
his
record,
and
at
the
time
that
he
killed
the
longs,
he
knew
that
if
i
leave
witnesses
and
they
can
identify
me
and
i
go
to
prison
for
breaking
into
their
house
and
stealing
money,
i
will
not
be
leaving
prison.
so
that
was
a
factor
as
well.
that
was
a
factor
as
well.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
again,
the
question
is
reasonableness.
we
don't
have
a
finding
here,
and
it
would
certainly
have
been
helpful.
but--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--we
don't--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--we
don't--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--right.
findings
would
certainly
be
helpful,
but
again,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
what
the
trial
court
did
is
reasonable,
not
if
what
he
did
was
perfect.
if
conspicuous
on
this
record,
we
have
factors
like
an
attempted
escape,
aiding
others
in
escaping,
the
fact
that
he
killed
to
avoid
lawful
arrest,
the
fact
that
between
his
initial
penalty
phase
and
the
retrial
he
had
pursued
his
remedies.
with
all
these
facts,
can
we
really
say
that
the
trial
court
was
on
the
side
of
unreasonableness
versus
reasonableness?
do
we
have
to
wait
for
mr.
deck
to
actually
have
an
outburst?
or
it
could
be
something
where
it's
an...
an
issue
of
the
spectators
in
the
courtroom.
there
could
be
many
things.
it
could
be
an
issue
of
what
the
particular
confines
of
the
jefferson
county
courthouse
are
and
whether
or
not
it's
set
up
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
escape
and
things
of
that
nature.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
i
think
that's
what
the
court
said
here.
however,
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
defendant
has
a
burden
to
establish
a
constitutional
violation.
and
further,
the
colloquy
of
the
court
and
counsel
was
such
that
counsel
said,
look,
these
restraints
make
him
look
dangerous.
and
the
court,
by
saying
he's
been
convicted,
said,
well,
he
is
dangerous.
now,
if
there
were
other
objections
to
the
restraints,
for
example,
that
he
was
unable
to
communicate
with
counsel
because
his
hand
was
not
free
and
he
couldn't
write
notes
or
if
the
restraints
were
causing
him
pain
or
if
the
restraints,
the
way
they
were
set
up,
were
causing
him
to
have
difficulty
facing
the
jury
perhaps--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--that's
right.
that's
true.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
first
of
all,
again,
the
defense
in
mitigation
was
essentially
that
mr.
deck
is
dangerous,
but
we
ought
to
spare
him
the
penalty
of
death
because
of
his
poor
upbringing.
and
that
defense
in
mitigation
does
not
intersect
or
have
any
sort
of
nexus
with
any
sort
of
presumptions
that
jurors
might
draw.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
that's
correct.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
there
were--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--actually
there
were
six--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--that
were
pled
in
this
case
and
the
jury
found
all
six.
and
they
are
as
follows.
the
murders
were
each
committed
while
he
was
engaged
in
another
homicide.
he
murdered
each
victim
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
money.
both
murders
involved
depravity
of
mind.
each
murder
was
committed
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
lawful
arrest.
each
murder
was
committed
while
mr.
deck
was
engaged
in
the
perpetration
of
a
burglary,
and
each
murder
was
committed
while
mr.
deck
was
engaged
in
the
perpetration
of
robbery.
so,
again,
none
of
these
factors...
there's
no
nexus
between
these
factors,
which
are
really
implicit
in
the
guilt
finding...
no
nexus
between
these
aggravating
circumstances
that
render
mr.
deck
death-eligible
and
any
sort
of
dangerousness
that
the
jurors
might
take
away
from
the
fact
that
he
was
restrained.
once
you
get
past
the
death-eligibility
hurdle
with
the
aggravating
circumstances,
then
comes
the
eighth
amendment
concerns
about
reliable
and
accurate
sentencing
in
the
selection
decision,
the
decision
that's
one
of
a
moral
nature
of
whether
this
person
should
be
put
to
death.
and
on
that
front,
again,
restraining
somebody
who's
twice
been
convicted
of
murder
is
not
inaccurate,
it
is
not
unreliable,
it's
not
misleading
in
any
way.

ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--i
think--
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
--i
think
in
terms
of
harmless
error,
that
would
be
our
second
position,
but
the
first
position
here
is
that
a
constitutional
violation
has
not
been
established.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
and
where
that's
the
case,
you
look
at
the
totality.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
where
it
wouldn't?
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
an
example
of
where
it
might
not
be
harmless
error
is
where
the
defendant's
defense
in
mitigation
is
focused
specifically
on
dangerousness
or
future
dangerousness.
for
example,
if
the
defense
in
mitigation
is
i
committed
these
murders,
but
i'm
very
sick
now,
i'm
feeble,
i'm
not
going
to
pose
any
sort
of
threat
to
anybody
inside
or
outside
the
prison
walls,
if
the
defense
in
mitigation
relates
to
danger.
or,
for
example,
if
the
defense
in
mitigation
was
that
while
incarcerated,
the
person
had
found
religion
and
realized
the
error
of
his
or
her
ways
and
was
no
longer
inclined
to
do
these
things
and
felt
remorse,
that
again
might
relate.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
correct.
that
would
make
a
difference.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
that
could
certainly
make
a
difference
there.
that's
correct.
or
another
example
of
where
the
defense
in
mitigation
might
intersect
more
with
the
dangerousness
issue.
in
the
simmons
line
of
cases,
in
one
of
the
cases
the
defense
was
that
the
particular
defendant
had
a
proclivity
for
attacking
elderly
women
and
that
was
the
nature
of
his
crime.
but
in
prison
there
were
no
elderly
women,
and
so
he
would
not
pose
a
danger
to
anyone
outside
the
prison
walls
if
incarcerated
for
life,
nor
would
he
pose
a
danger
to
other
prisoners
because
they
were
not
elderly
women.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
i
think
that's
the
question
when
the
trial
court
looks
at
the
restraints
issue,
but
mr.
deck
is
saying
that
this
impaired
the
reliability
of
his
sentencing
under
the
eighth
amendment.
and
there,
we
do
look
at
these
other
kinds
of
issues.
it's
not
whether
he
would
be
dangerous
in
the
courtroom.
that's
the
trial
court
decision
at
the
front
end
under
the
eighth
amendment,
and
when
we
look
at
reliability,
is
this
something
that
is
going
to
impel
the
jury
to
impose
a
death
sentence
based
upon
whim
or
caprice
or
arbitrariness.
and
we
would
submit
that
it
is
not.
again,
to
restrain
somebody
who's
convicted
of
killing
not
one,
but
two
people,
to
do
that
does
not
send
the
jury
irrevocably
down
the
path
of
giving
death.
and
that
points
up
the
prosecutor's
argument
in
this
case.
ms.
cheryl
c.
nield
it
could.
and
it
would
depend
upon
the
prison
security.
the
difference
being,
in
prison,
he's
already
confined
versus
outside
the
prison
walls.
it...
it
could
present
a
problem.
in
one
of
the
spain
cases,
the...
the
neck
restraint
was
deemed
to
be
cruel
and
unusual,
and
particularly
if
it's
ongoing,
if
it's...
if
it
occurs
for
a
lengthy
period
of
time.
but,
of
course,
we
don't
have
that
here
and
we
have
not
a
prison
context
but
a
context
of
a
local,
rural
courtroom
where
the
trial
judge
has
to
make
sure
that
the
people
in
that
courtroom,
the
personnel,
the
spectators,
the
jurors,
that
they
are
safe.
and
we
would
submit
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
that
trial
court's
decision
was
not
unreasonable.
the
missouri
supreme
court
was
correct
in
its
analysis
and
it
should
be
affirmed.
