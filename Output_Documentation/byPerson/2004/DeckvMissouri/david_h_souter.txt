justice
david
h.
souter
what
was
the
basic
justification
in
the
first
place
for
shackling?
i
mean,
were
there
insufficient
bailiffs
or...
or
why
did
they
do
it
in...
even
in...
during
the
trial
itself?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
indication
that
there
were
or
were
not
present
court
security
officers?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is...
you...
you
have...
justice
kennedy
alluded
to
one
of
your
earlier
arguments,
and
that
is
the...
somehow
the...
the
shackling
affects
the
capacity
to
participate.
i
thought
you
meant
by
that
if
the...
the
hands
are
shackled,
he
can't
write
notes
to
counsel.
do
you
mean
something
else?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
i
would
grant
you
if...
if
they...
they
are
so
tight
that
it's
causing
pain,
you've
got
a
separate
problem,
but
short
of
that,
does
the
so-called
capacity
to
participate
suffer
simply
because
he's...
he's
in
irons?
i
mean,
the
only
participation
that
he's
going
to
do,
i
presume,
is...
is
sit
there
and...
and
communicate
with
his
lawyer.
it's
going
to
affect
his
capacity
to
write
a
note
to
his
lawyer.
what
else
is
it
going
to
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
know
of
any
instance
of
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your...
your
problem
with
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
simply
that
at
that
point
with
all
these
chains
and
so
on,
he's
giving
an
impression
or
the
state
is
requiring
him,
in
effect,
to
give
an
impression
to
the
jury
that
may
be
a...
a
false
impression.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
back
to
participation.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
would
be
true
if
he
were
in
the
legirons.
justice
david
h.
souter
true,
true.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't...
isn't
the
question
whether
he...
he
was
dangerous
in
the
courtroom?
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no
question
he
was
dangerous
when
he
committed
the
murders,
but...
but
i
don't
know
that
that
means
he's
dangerous
in
a
courtroom.
justice
david
h.
souter
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
fact--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
the...
the
stated
aggravating
circumstances
didn't,
but
the
point
of...
one
point
of
the
argument
is
that
by
shackling
the
man
in...
in
this
complete
and
visible
way,
you
are
creating
the
impression
that
no
one
could
fail
to...
to
perceive
that
this
guy
is
so
dangerous
that
they
can't
even
depend
upon
courtroom
security
either
to
protect
him
from
the...
protect
the
jurors
or
courtroom
personnel
or
to
prevent
escape.
that...
excuse
me.
that
may
not
be
a
verbal
argument
about
dangerousness,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
an
unmistakably
visible
one.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
