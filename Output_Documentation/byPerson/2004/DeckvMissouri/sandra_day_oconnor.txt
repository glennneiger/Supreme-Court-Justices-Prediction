o'connor
what's
the
authority
for
the
burden
of
proof
question?
what...
what...
which
of
our
cases
do
you
rely
on
for
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
are
the
factors
in
missouri
that
the
state
would
be
trying
to
prove
to
urge
the
imposition
of
death
versus
life
imprisonment?
what
are
the
things
in
missouri
that
are
deemed
relevant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
future
dangerousness
an
issue
in
missouri?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
percival,
would
you
still
be
here
today
with
this
argument
if
the
defendant
had
simply
had
shackles
around
his
ankles
that
would
have
prevented
him,
in...
in
effect,
from
running
or
lunging
at
anyone,
but
that
that
had
been
concealed
by
appropriate
covers
around
the
table
where
he
was
sitting
so
that
the
jury
was
unaware
of
that
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
still
be
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--making
this
argument
that
it's
inherently
prejudicial
even
though
the
jury
couldn't
see
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
wasn't
obvious
or
visible
particularly
to
the
jury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
there
some
burden
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
court
to
consider
at
least
alternative
restraints
or
measures
to
make
sure
that
there's
no
misbehavior?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
apparently
that
was
done.
do
you
say
that
there
was
no
motion
made
by
defense
counsel
and
that
alternatives
were
not
proposed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
circumstances
that
you
were
given
was
a
traffic
offender.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
with...
with
non-visible
restraints.
is
that
perfectly
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
kind
of
an
extreme
position,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you
taking
the
position
here
that
this
record
does
not
disclose
that
the
belly
chains
and
the
handcuffs
and
the
other
restraints
were
not
visible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
concede
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
the
ones
that
were
used
on
mr.
deck
during
the
trial?
was
that
an
alternative
that
was
reasonable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
part
it
depends
on
whose
burden
it
is.
is
it
the
burden
of
the
state,
if
they're
going
to
use
shackles,
to
somehow
establish
that
it's
needed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
do
you
take
the
position
that
they're
free
to
impose
shackles
in
every
case,
even
a
traffic
offense,
if
the
prosecutor
wishes
to
do
it,
without
any
justification?
that's
your
position
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
my
question,
and...
and
it
relates
to
what
is
the
burden
of
the
state
in
these
situations
to
use
the
visible
restraints?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
where
in
this
record
do
i
find
that
the
state
carried
that
burden--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
that
there
was
a
finding
by
the
trial
judge
on
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
you
point
me
to
places
in
the
record
where
it
supports
your
position
on
the
use
of
the
visible
restraint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
had
that
not
occurred
before
he
was
even
tried?
