justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
the
judge
had
said
this
defendant
has
just
been
convicted
of
killing
two
people.
he
convicted
them...
as
the
jury
knows,
he
was
convicted
of
having
killed
them
because
he
wanted
to
avoid
being
sent
back
to
prison.
the
jury
may
sit
there
and
think,
well,
if
he
killed
two
people
to
avoid
being
sent
back
to
prison
and
we've
just
voted
him
guilty,
maybe
he's
going
to
try
to
lunge
out
in
the
courtroom
and
get
us.
and
therefore,
i
want
him
shackled.
now,
suppose
the
judge
had
said
that.
would
that
be
an
adequate
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
his
motion?
is
mr.
leftwich...
is
that
defense
counsel?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
fine.
he
says
i
would
ask
that
or
like
to
move
to
strike
the
entire
jury
panel
for
cause
because
of
the
fact
that
mr.
deck
is
shackled
in
front
of
the
jury
and
makes
them
think
that
he
is
going
to...
that
he
is
violent
today
and
going
to
do
something
in
the
courtroom.
and
i
read
that,
he's
saying,
of
course,
they
can
see
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
doesn't
say
he
can
see
it...
they
can
see
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
has
anybody
said...
he
said,
judge,
i
would
like
you
to
get
rid
of
this
jury
which
happens
to
be
looking
at
the
shackles.
okay.
now,
at
that
point,
you
have
to
do...
then
isn't
it
up
to
the
prosecution
to
say,
what
do
you
mean
looking
at
them?
they
can't
see
them.
they're
hidden.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
if
there
are
some
factors
that
favor
putting
him
in
shackles
and
i
guess
others
might
not,
what's
the
argument
that
the
judge
shouldn't
at
least
have
to
make
a
finding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you
know,
i
realize
you
want
to
save
the
conviction
and
the
penalty,
but
if
you
look
at
the
mine
run
of
cases,
it's
pretty
hard
for
me
to
see
how
the
state
could
show
special
circumstances
and
they
not
get
a
finding
from
the
judge
that
they're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
pretty
hard
to
see
an
argument
against
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that
hurts
your
case,
but
i...
i
still
need
to
think
of
some
argument
or
reason
why
the
judge
shouldn't
have
to
at
least
make
a
finding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
petitioner,
carman
deck
was
convicted
of
murder
and
sentenced
to
death.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
constitution
permits
missouri
officials
to
shackle
deck
with
visible
restraints,
leg
irons,
handcuffs,
and
a
belly
chain
during
the
sentencing
stage
of
his
capital
proceedings.
we
answer
the
question,
no
and
we
do
so
in
three
stages.
first,
we
consider
shackling
during
the
guilt
state
of
a
criminal
trial.
we
hold
that
the
constitution's
due
process
clause
embodies
a
well
established
shackling
rule
or
anti-routine
shackling
rule
that
is
the
rule
cannot
be
routine.
the
rule
prohibits
the
use
of
physical
restraints
visible
to
the
jury
in
the
absence
of
a
trial
court
determination
in
the
exercise
of
the
courts
discretion
that
shackling
is
justified
in
the
particular
case
by
an
essential
state
interest
for
example,
the
interest
in
courtroom
security.
but
you
have
to
look
at
the
particular
trial
and
the
particular
defendant.
blackstone
in
the
1800's
described
this
rule
as
"written
in
our
ancient
books",
a
rule
like
it.
the
court
has
referred
to
that
kind
of
rule
in
earlier
cases
with
approval
and
in
doing
so,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
even
though
shackles
may
be
less
painful
to
the
defendant
today
than
in
blackstone?s
time,
strong
reasons
still
exist
in
support
of
that
kind
of
rule.
the
reasons
are
related
to
the
presumption
of
innocence,
to
the
right
of
an
accused
to
assist
in
his
defense,
and
the
need
to
maintain
courtroom
dignity
and
decorum.
second,
we
consider
the
guilt
stage
in
the
capital
case
and
we
go
on
to
hold
that
the
same
rule
applies
at
the
sentencing
stage
of
a
capital
case.
at
that
stage,
the
defendant
has
already
been
convicted,
so
the
presumption
of
innocence
no
longer
applies,
but
still,
the
jury
has
to
make
a
choice
between
life
and
death
and
that
is
a
choice
where
accuracy
is
no
less
important.
but
the
defendant's
appearance
in
shackles
almost
inevitably
implies
that
court
authorities
consider
him
a
danger
to
the
community.
it
almost
inevitably
affects
adversely
the
jury's
perception
of
the
defendant's
character
and
thereby
almost
inevitably
undermines
the
jury's
ability
to
weigh
accurately
all
relevant
considerations
when
determining
whether
the
defendant
deserves
death.
for
these
reasons,
we
conclude
the
constitution
applies
the
same
rule
forbidding
the
routine
use
of
shackles
unless
the
trial
judge
finds
them
necessary
to
further
an
essential
state
interest
say
the
interest
in
courtroom
security
in
a
particular
case.
in
saying
this,
we
recognize
the
importance
of
maintaining
courtroom
security.
we
do
not
underestimate
the
need
to
restrain
dangerous
defendants
in
certain
cases.
but
a
case
and
defendant
specific
determination
of
that
special
need
should
help
to
maintain
necessary
security
without
undermining
a
general
rule
that
forbids
any
routine
use
of
shackling.
third,
we
consider
missouri's
arguments
that
in
any
event
its
shackling
decision
met
the
requirements
we
have
set
forth
and
for
reasons
that
we
set
out
in
our
opinion,
we
find
those
case
specific
arguments
unconvincing.
for
these
reasons
and
for
other
reasons
set
forth
in
the
opinion,
the
case
is
reversed
and
remanded.

thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
