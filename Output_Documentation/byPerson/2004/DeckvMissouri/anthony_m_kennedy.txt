justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
principle
is
there's
a
right
not
to
be
shackled,
and
when
the
state
says
that
that
right
has
to
be
compromised,
then
the
state
has
to
have
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
looked...
and
i
find
that
rule
in
chapman?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
back
on
your
earlier
part
of
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
that
it's
inherently
prejudicial
in
the
sentencing
stage,
if
one
of
us
were
to
agree
or
the
whole
court,
the
majority,
were
to
agree
with
your
position
and
write
the
opinion
out,
what
would
we
cite
for
that,
other...
other
than
our...
our
own
assumptions
as
to
how
the
system
worked,
judicial
notice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
with...
with
character,
we
know...
we
know
he's
a
murderer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
your
whole
case
turn
on
how
shackling
affects
the
argument
that
you're...
that
the
accused
is
making
that
he's
not
dangerous,
et
cetera,
or
is
there
some
other
different
standard
that
we
could
use
to
the
effect,
say,
that
it's
just
not
consistent
with
the
dignity
in
an
american
courtroom,
something
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
your
whole
case
turn
on
whether
or
not
this
is
prejudicial
to
the
fact-finding
process
on
the
specific
issues
or
is
there
some
more
general
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
i
think
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i...
i
think
there
is...
is
something
to
the
point
that
if
i'm
a
juror
and
the
defendant
is
sitting
about
as
close
to
me
as
you
are
at
the
counsel
table
and
i
see
that
he
can't
suddenly
jump
out
at
me,
i
have
a
certain...
certain
security
in
making
a
deliberated
judgment.
i...
i
do
think
it
may
cut
both
ways.
and
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
is
if
there
are
some
other
considerations
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
this.
you,
of
course,
would
object
to
having
to
show
prejudice
in
any
individual
case.
then
it
seems
to
me,
to
follow,
that
that's
prejudice...
that
that
means
because
prejudice
is
difficult
to
show.
and
if
prejudice
is
judicial...
difficult
to
show,
why
should
we
rule
for
you
anyway?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
think
you
have
to
give
that
answer
to
justice...
to
justice
breyer,
and
that's
why
i'm
asking.
i...
i
think
you
just
have
to
say
that
this
is
inherently
inconsistent
with
the
atmosphere
we
want
to
have
in
a
courtroom.
it
seems
to
me...
i...
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
can
find
a
lot
of
authority
for
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
has
to
be
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then
you're
giving
away
the
riggins
argument,
which
is
that
this
somehow
affects
the
psyche
of
the
defendant
and
he
can't
fully
participate,
et
cetera,
which
i
thought
was
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
can
every
defendant
have
leg
braces
in
every
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you...
do
you
take
the
position
that
every
defendant
can
be
restrained
if
the
restraints
are
not
visible
to
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
legirons
strapped
to
the
leg
of
the...
of
the
table
but
not
visible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
want
to
know
what
your
position
is.
traffic
offenders?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
state
of
missouri
is
submitting
to
us
the
proposition
that
every
defendant
in
every
case
can
be
shackled
so
long
as
it's
not
visible.
and
i...
i
find
that
an
extreme
position
because
it's
an
indignity
on
the
defendant
and
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
dignity
in
a
courtroom.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
he
be
forced
to
wear
prison
clothes
once
he's
convicted
and
it's
the
sentencing
phase?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
they
put
him
in
a
cage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he's...
he's
been
convicted.
we
know
he's
dangerous.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
what
did
he
do?
draw
a
map
or
what?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
it's
never
ground
for
reversal?
i'm...
i'm
wondering,
in
line
with
justice
scalia's
question,
is...
is...
would
the
calculus
be,
well,
this
is
not
a
close
case
and
some
other
cases
are
closer?
i
mean,
is
that
what
we
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your...
your...
i...
i
think
first
position
at
least
would
be
that
it's
never
prejudicial.
but
assume
we
don't
agree
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
harmless
error
work
to...
to
pursue
justice
scalia's
line
of
questioning?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could...
could
you
comment
on
whether
or
not
there's
harmful
error
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
asking
us
to
say
that
in
light
of
six
aggravating
factors
on
which
he
was
convicted,
the
result
likely
would
have
been
different?
