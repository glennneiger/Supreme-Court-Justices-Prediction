justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
the
second
case
called
mid-con
freight
systems
against
the
michigan
public
service
commission
is
more
complicated.
it
concerns
a
different
$100
fee
per
truck.
michigan
imposes
that
$100
fee
on
trucks
that
have
michigan
license
plates
but
those
which
are
operating
entirely
in
interstate
commerce
across
state
lines.
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
says
when
“a
state
registration
requirement”
imposes
a
fee
that
is
really
more
than
a
few
dollars,
it
is
unlawful.
does
that
federal
statute
preempt,
forbid,
michigan’s
$100
fee?
well,
that
depends.
is
the
state
fee
what
the
statute
is
about?
is
it
a
“state
registration
requirement”
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
we
conclude
that
it
is
not.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
statute
is
talking
about.
we
examine
the
statutes,
the
federal
statutes,
language,
context,
history,
and
what
it
tells
us
is
that
this
statute
is
about
somewhat
interesting,
what
used
to
be
called
the
bingo
card
system.
if
you
have
seen
a
truck,
they
used
to
have
these
things
in
the
front
that
look
like
bingo
cards
with
the
names
or
abbreviations
for
different
states,
and
what
they
put
there
was
a
decal
which
is
a
debt
from
each
state
which
would
give
them
the
decal
provided
the
truck
showed
that
it
complied
with
certain
federal
requirements,
like
in
the
sense
that
they
had
a
federal
permit.
if
you
did
that,
you
proved
that
to
the
state,
and
then
the
state
give
you
a
little
decal,
you
put
it
on
the
bingo
card
and
then
you
could
travel
through
the
state.
well,
congress
decided
that
was
all
too
complicated
and
so
it
said
we
are
going
to
have
a
new
system,
and
it
created
this
statute
which
creates
a
new
system.
and
now,
with
your
interstate
truck,
you
go
to
one
state
and
they
get
you
all
the
decals
in
a
sense
at
one
go.
that
is
what
the
statute
is
about.
now,
is
this
michigan
requirement
about
that?
no.
we
go
through
it
and
we
think
the
michigan
requirement
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
or
not
much
to
do
with
it
and,
therefore,
it
falls
outside
the
words
state
requirement
within
the
statute
and
therefore,
maybe
there
is
some
other
thing
that
prohibits
michigan
from
having
this
but
it
is
not
the
statute.
now
we
go
through
this
in
the
opinion
in
some
detail.
it
is
a
close
question
but
we
end
up
affirming
the
similar
determination
of
the
michigan
court
that
this
statute
does
not
prohibit
that
michigan
fee.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
o’connor
joined.
