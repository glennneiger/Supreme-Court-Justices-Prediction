do
we
need
either
imaginative
powers
or
empirical
data
to
know
that
when
a
13-year-old
is
brought
into
a
room
in
his
school,
taken
out
of
class,
four
people
are
there,
two
are
police
officers,
one
is
assistant
principal,
threatened
with
custody,
that
that
person
is
not
going
to
feel
free
to
take
off
and
leave?
justice
elena
kagan
general
cooper,
i'm
not
sure
how
i
understand
or
that
i
understand
how
this
would
be
turning
miranda
upside
down.
miranda
is
already
an
incredibly
complicated
test
about
when
those
warnings
need
to
be
given,
all
right.
so
there
are
all
manner
of
circumstances
which
go
into
the
determination
of
whether
a
person
would
feel
free
to
learn
--
leave,
whether
a
person
would
feel
as
though
he
were
in
custody,
a
thousand
things,
how
many
people
are
in
the
room,
how
long
the
interrogation
is,
where
the
interrogation
is,
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
interrogation.
so,
this
is
not
a
bright
line
test,
and
all
that
we
would
be
doing
here
would
be
adding
an
additional
objective
factor
to
an
already
multifaceted
inquiry.
justice
elena
kagan
counsel,
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
view
that
a
blind
person
should
be
treated
as
a
blind
person
for
--
for
these
purposes?
justice
elena
kagan
and
a
deaf
person
should
be
treated
as
a
deaf
person
for
these
purposes?
justice
elena
kagan
as
is
youth.
as
is
youth,
an
obvious
external
circumstance
that
this
boy
was
13
years
old.
justice
elena
kagan
you
know,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
you
are
trying
to
understand
this
situation
as
the
blind
person
would
have
seen
it
or
as
the
deaf
person
would
have
seen
it
or
as
the
13-year-old
would
have
seen
it,
and
i
don't
understand
why
it's
different.
justice
elena
kagan
but
that's
all
we're
doing
with
the
young
person.
and
in
fact,
most
of
us,
many
of
us,
have
a
great
deal
more
experience
understanding
the
world
through
the
eyes
of
a
young
person
or
children,
perhaps,
than
understanding
the
eyes
--
the
world
through
the
eyes
of
a
severely
sensory
deprived
person.
we're
asking
the
exact
same
thing
in
both
contexts:
what
is
this
person
--
what
is
this
--
what
do
the
objective
circumstances
appear
to
a
person
in
this
situation?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
feigin--
justice
elena
kagan
--i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
think
that
a
00
a
person
with
down's
syndrome,
that
that
should
be
taken
into
account
in
this
inquiry?
