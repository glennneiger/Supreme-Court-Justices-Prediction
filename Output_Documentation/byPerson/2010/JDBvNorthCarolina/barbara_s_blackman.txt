ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
j.d.b.
was
only
13
years
old
when
he
was
taken
out
of
his
middle
school
classroom
and
escorted
to
a
closed
door
interrogation
conducted
by
outside
law
enforcement
regarding
a
matter
that
did
not
take
place
on
school
property.
he
was
isolated
from
his
family
who
had
already
demonstrated
an
interest
in
this
investigation
and
sought
to
shield
him
from
the
police.
he
was
not
advised
that
he
was
free
to
leave
or
free
not
to
answer
questions
until
he
had
already
incriminated
himself.
the
restrictions
on
j.d.b.'s
freedom
of
movement
which
existed
because
of
his
youth
were
heightened
by
the
manner
in
which
this
officer
chose
to
conduct
this
interrogation
and
the
expected
deference
to
authority
figures
categorically
characteristic
of
children
were
taken
advantage
of
by
the
manner
in
which
this
officer
chose
to
conduct
the
interrogation.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
justice--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--justice
scalia,
what
we
are
proposing
is
that
the
test
be
a
court
may
consider
age
in
determining
whether
a
reasonable
person
in
the
juvenile--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--so
we
are
not--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--we
did
not
suggest
that
it
be
calibrated
by
age,
although
in
state
court
jurisdictions
many
of
them
are
and
are
not
finding
that
a
difficult
test
to
perform.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
it
is
to
be
the
exercise
of
reasonable
judgment
by
the
judge
taking
into
account
common
sense--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--community
experience
is
one.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
clearly
in
the
jurisdiction
in
which
he
practices
he
should
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
a
court
utilizes
that
type
of--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--but
we're
not
suggesting
that
that
be
done.
what
a
court
is
examining
is--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--as
this
court
has
frequently
recognized,
the
voluntariness
inquiry
is
more
difficult
for
courts
to
perform
than
the
miranda
custody
one.
and
you
have
also
recognized
that
the
court--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--the
police
officer
plays
a
role
in
the
voluntariness,
also.
and
the
police
officer
must
be
assessing
whether
the
circumstances
may
be
giving
rise
to
an
involuntary
confession.
age--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--no.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
age
is
different
because,
number
one,
it
involves
restrictions
on
freedom
of
movement,
so
the
circumstances
of
the
interrogation
are
going
to
be
understood
and
interpreted
differently
by
a
child
than
it
would
be
by
an
adult.
secondly,
we're
talking
about
cognitive
differences
which
exist
between
children
and
adults
which
affects
their
perception
and
understanding.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
as
far
as
i
know,
there
hasn't
been
the
recognition
in
the
law
that
there
is,
as
to
children,
that
proves
such
as
the
mentally
handicapped
are
unable
to--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--well,
we're
simply
making
the
point
that
there's
not
necessarily
going
to
be
a
floodgate
opening.
and
we
haven't
seen
that--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--conceptually
absolutely.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
your
honor,
what
we
are
talking
about
are
a
complex
of
characteristics
which
are
unique
to
children,
and
that's
what
we
are
examining
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
i
agree
completely.
this
officer
was
assigned
the
case
because
it
had
already
been
determined
that
a
juvenile
was
involved.
this
is
the
population
that
he
deals
with
on
a
daily
basis.
he
certainly
has
a
basis
on
which
to
assess
how
j.d.b.'s
youth
was
factoring
into
this
interrogation.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
obviously
his
age
would
factor
into
whether
there
was
a
valid
waiver.
but,
yes,
he
has
got
to
mirandize
or
otherwise
j.d.b.--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--not
necessarily.
i
mean,
some
children
will
not
understand
miranda
warnings,
just
as
some
adults
don't
understand
miranda
warnings.
but
children
are
nonetheless
--
have
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
be
told
of
their
rights,
so
that
they
can
at
least
have
the
opportunity
to
make
an
informed
decision.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
your
honor--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--state
courts
have
been
performing
this
analysis
now
for
several
decades,
and
they
haven't
indicated
that
they
have
difficulty
doing
so.
and
to
the
extent
that
your--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--what?
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
part
of
your
question--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--your
honor--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
relative
youngness
and
relative
oldness.
i
mean,
the
empirical
data
demonstrates
to
us
that
the
older
a
child
is
to
an
adult,
the
more
adult-like
they
are.
the
younger,
the
farther
away
they
are
from
that
adult
standard--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--excuse
me?
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
empirical
data
does
exist.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
i'm
simply
pointing
that
out.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
i'm
simply
pointing
out
that
the
empirical
data
supports
that.
there
are
bases
of
knowledge
from
which--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--we
do
not.
i'm
simply
pointing
out
that
there
is
a
basis
of
knowledge
from
which
courts
as
well
as
police
officers
can
make
the
required
assessment.
it
is
so
clear
in
this
case,
however--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--a
judge
should
be
able
to
consider
that,
and
under
the
clear
circumstances
of
this
case,
it
is
unlikely
that
a--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--i'm
not
sure
i
understood
the
question.
[laughter]
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
yes.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
it
doesn't
change
the
rule
itself.
i
mean,
the
rule
itself
remains:
all
objective
circumstances
relevant
to
the
custody
determination
must
be
considered.
what
it's
doing
is
taking
this
out
of
the
reasonable
adult
standard,
which
by
default
is
the
only
one,
then,
that
can
be
used,
and
so
it's
not
going
to
be
muddying
the
waters
in
the
sense
that
it
is
something
needed
in
order
to
promote
accurate
fact-finding.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
i
mean,
that
is
an
objective
circumstance
that
occurs
in
the
course
of
an
interrogation
which
is
very
weighty
in
determining
if
custody
occurs.
here--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--it
involves
all
of
the
circumstances
which
are
arising
during
the
course
of
these
interrogations,
but
certainly
advising
someone
that
they
are
free
to
leave
and
advising
them
that
they
are
free
not
to
answer
questions
is
almost
half
of
the
miranda
warning,
and
it
is
giving
the
child--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--whether
that
would
factor
in
depends,
i
think,
upon
whether
they're
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
police,
because
what
we're
looking
at
is--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--oh.
what
we're
examining
is
whether
we've
got
a
police-dominated
environment
and
coercion
in
the
situation
and
circumstances
under
which
the
child
evaluates
the--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--no,
i'm
not.
obviously,
the
specific
factors
that
occur
in
the
course
of
any
interrogation
will
be
considered,
but
our
focus
here
is
upon
what
the
police
officer
must
do.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
it
is
relevant
in
this
situation,
because
--
by
north
carolina
law.
because
a
custodial
interrogation
was
occurring,
there
was
a
requirement
that
a
parent
or
guardian
be
present.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
what
i
understood
the
question
was:
was
it
relevant
that
a
parent
was
not
contacted?
in
this
particular
situation,
yes,
because
that
was
going
to
create
an
independent
basis
on
which
the
statement
wasn't
going
to
be
admitted,
and
is
than
additional
reason
why--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--independent
of
miranda.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
but
that
is
an
additional
reason
why
police
officers
need
to
be
aware
of
what
the
age
is
of
a
child
that
they
are
interrogating
because
of
independent
obligations
arising
out
of
state
statutes.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
no,
i
believe
it
remains
relevant
to
the
miranda
question,
because--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--that
is
correct.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
because
of
state
statutory
requirements,
here
they
were.
obviously,
not
every
state
has
that
kind
of
requirement.
in
this
particular
situation,
there
was
a
requirement
of
parental
presence.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
just
explaining
that
independent
bases
may
arise
for
which
an
officer
has
to
be
aware
of
the
age.
and
given
that,
we're
not
imposing
additional
burdens.
these
are
things
that
police
officers
have
to
be
considering.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
if
the
interrogation
is
occurring
under
circumstances
where
the
officer
should
have
known,
then
i
think
the
burden
remains
with
the
officer
to
consider
this,
and
that
could
arise
from--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--if
there
is
no
way
to
verify
the
information
that
the
child
is
giving,
then
the
officer
accepts
the
id
as
being
the
age
of
the
person
he
is
interrogating.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
i
think
that
if--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--um--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--the
officer
has
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
his
observations.
i
mean,
objective
circumstances
are
things
that
are
readily
apparent.
there
can
be
circumstances
which
tell
the
officer
that,
in
fact,
he
is
dealing
with
a
child,
either
the
setting,
the
appearance,
the
contact
of
parents,
and
so
on.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
but
if
there
--
if
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
upon
which
the
officer
could
discern
that
this
is
a
child,
if
he
has
no
reason
to
know,
then
the
rule
that
we
are
asking
to
be
put
into
effect
would
not
apply.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
yes.
i
mean,
what
we
would
be
assessing
is:
are
the
circumstances
clear
such
that
the
officer
should
have
known?
and
if
they
simply
could
not
ascertain
it,
then
the
rule
that
we're
asking
for
would
not
apply.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
no,
it
is
must.
as
with
any
objective
circumstance,
the
court
has
to
take
it
into
account,
and
we
can't
be
relegating
some
to
a
discretionary
review
and
others
to
mandatory
review.
so,
yes,
if
a
child
is
involved
in
the
case,
then
a
court
must
take
that
into
account--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--in
determining
if
there's
custody.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
it's
a
simple
enough
matter,
but
no.
but
i
think
if
the
person--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--as
a
terry
stop,
where
miranda
is
not
coming
into
play
at
all--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--we're
not
in
a
custodial
interrogation
setting,
i
think
in
your
question,
and
so
miranda
is
not
coming
into
play
at
all,
but
i
mean,
this
is
a
matter--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--if
there
is
a
custodial
--
if
we
have
restraint
on
freedom
of
movement
which
is
rising
to
the
degree
of
a
formal
arrest,
it's
a
simple
enough
matter
to
ask.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
what
is
known
to
both.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
yes.
but
i
think
that
we
can't
be
encouraging
willful
blindness,
either;
and
so,
you
know,
if
an
officer
encounters
someone
at
a
facility
where
only
children
would
be,
for
example,
like
an
elementary
school
or
a
juvenile
detention
facility--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--indeed.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
i
agree.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
correct.
i
did
--
there
have
been
a
lot
of
questions
that
sort
of
presupposed
that
we
are
doing
a
subjective
inquiry,
and
i
think
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
case.
what
we
are
not
doing--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--well,
miranda
is
the
only
procedure
to
date
that
anyone
uses,
and
constitutionally
they
are
--
everyone
is
entitled
to
some
advisement
so
that
they
can
make
an
informed
choice.
i
mean,
whether
there
should
be
a
more
simplified
or
different
miranda
warning
for
children
is
an
issue
for
another
day,
but
we
can't
simply
say
we're
not
going
to
do
anything.
we
are
not
going
to
tell
these
children
that
they
don't
have
to
cooperate
with
the
state
in
building
a
case
against
themselves.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
i
think
that
one's
status
as
an
inmate,
for
example,
can
be
characterized
as
objective,
and
certainly
that
has
been
taken
into
account
because
inmates
share
that
same
baseline
restriction
on
freedom
of
movement
that
children
do,
and
so
this
court
in
--
shafter
--
for
example,
characterized
it
as
what
would
the
reasonable
person
in
the
inmate's
position
have
understood
as
to
his
freedom
of
movement.
so,
yes,
i
mean,
there
can
be
other
objective
circumstances
individual
to
the
person,
but
we're
still
not
answering
a
subjective--
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
--i
think
that's
for
other
litigants
to
press
upon
this
court
upon
proper
records
with
input
from
experts
as
to
whether
it
relates
to
the
special
susceptibilities
of
children,
how
cognitively
different
they
are
which
is
affecting
their
perception
and
judgment
of
what's
going
on
about
them,
and
those
are
questions
for
another
day.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
ms.
barbara
s.
blackman
i
think
what's
very
odd
in
this
case
is
that
the
only
party
that
didn't
consider
j.d.b.'s
age
was
the
courts.
i
mean,
it
was
clearly
being
taken
into
account
by
officer
dicostanzo,
and
j.d.b.
was
fully
aware
of
his
own
age.
and
under
thompson
v.
keohane,
what
a
reviewing
court
is
supposed
to
be
doing
is
immersing
itself
in
the
actual
circumstances
of
the
case;
and
without
this
consideration
of
age,
then
the
courts
are
examining
hypothetical,
because
--
hypothetical
interrogations
and
not
the
one
that
was
actually
occurring
in
the
case.
officers
have
to
make
judgments
about
every
objective
circumstance
that
arises,
and
asking
them
to
make
objective
determinations
on
juvenile
status
is
no
different
and
is
not
going
to
muddy
the
water.
i
think
as
justice
kagan
pointed
out,
custody
is
a
very
difficult
issue.
it's
not
subject
to
bright
line
rules.
but
we
can't
be
defining
it
in
such
a
way
where
we
are
requiring
these
children
to
be
someone
that
they
never
could
be,
and
that
is,
reasonable
adults.
if
our
goal
here
is
to
ensure
reliability
of
factfinding,
reliability
of
statements,
if
we
want
to
reduce
the
coercion,
to
which
our
citizens
are
entitled,
then
this
rule
needs
to
be
put
into
play,
and
we
ask
that
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
decision
be
reversed.
thank
you.
