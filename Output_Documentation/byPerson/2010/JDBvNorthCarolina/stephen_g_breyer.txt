justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
this
test
which
comes
from
three
cases,
the
first
being
berkemer,
the
second
stansbury,
and
the
third
i'll
tell
you
in
a
second?
it
is
that
those
--
what
are
--
in
considering
a
reasonable
person
for
this
purpose
and
avoiding
subjective
states
of
mind,
you
would
look
at
objective
circumstances,
known
to
both
the
officer
and
the
suspect
that
are
likely
relevant
to
the
way
a
person
would
understand
his
situation.
all
right?
so
both
would
be
both
mental
illness
and
age
and
--
i
don't
know,
whether
you
speak
english,
and
a
lot
of
other
things
would
be
relevant,
provided
they
are
things
that
are
relevant
to
how
a
person
would
understand
his
situation
and
are
known
to
both
the
officer
and
the
individual.
the
third
case,
of
course,
is
my
dissent
in
alvarez.
[laughter]
but
nothing
in
the
majority
conflicts
with
that,
that
i
can
see,
except
the
holding.
i
thought
i
lost
the
case,
but
apparently
it's
up
again,
so
i
don't
see
why
that
isn't
a
perfectly
good
test.
but
if
you're
not
going
to
support
it,
then
i've
got
no
support.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
i
mean
what
justice
scalia
was
really
asking
is,
do
you
favor
something
like
this
test
that
i
read,
which
is
open
as
to
circumstance?
anything
could
fit
in
that
blank,
as
long
as
both
policemen
and
the
--
and
the
individual
know
it
and
it
is
relevant
as
to
how
he
understands
the
circumstance,
whether
he's
likely
free
to
go
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
yes,
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
would
add
none?
no
others?
no
other
characteristics?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
big
sign
jail
cell,
the
door
is
unlocked.
when
you
want
to
leave,
leave.
is
he
in
custody?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
he
in
custody?
it's
a
jail
cell,
but
a
big
sign,
"go
ahead,
leave,
go
when
you
want.
"
is
he
free
to
leave?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
so
do
i.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
just
tell
you
one
other
circumstance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
only
speaks
spanish.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ukrainian
is
the
only
thing
he
speaks.
now
are
you
willing
to
take
that
into
account?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
now,
i'll
say
another
fact.
exactly
the
same,
except
there
are
very
steep
steps
and
he's
in
a
wheelchair.
are
you
willing
to
take
that
into
account?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
why
aren't
you
willing
to
take
into
account
an
ambiguous
situation
as
was
true
in
alvarado,
a
tough
situation
where
it's
pretty
unclear;
he
was
brought
there
by
his
parents
and
there
are
all
these
things
around
that
might
suggest
to
a
20-year-old,
yeah,
you
could
leave,
but
to
a
12-year-old,
"no".
if
the
judge
can
take
into
account
whether
he's
in
a
wheelchair,
whether
he
just
speaks
ukrainian,
whether
in
fact
a
thing
--
you
have
to
swim
through
a
pool
and
he
doesn't
know
how
to
swim
--
i
mean,
all
kinds
of
things
like
that;
why
can't
he
take
into
account
in
a
proper
situation
before
he
thinks
he's
in
custody
or
not,
things
they
both
know
including
whether
he's
8
years
old
or
22?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
obvious
whether
he's
8-year-old
or
2
2,
too.
i'll
tell
you
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
and
you
have
to
think
like
a
ukrainian
speaker
or
think
like
a
--
a
--
a
--
like
a
person
who
knows
he's
in
a
wheelchair
before
you
know
he
can't
get
up
those
steep
steps.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
exactly
the
--
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
haven't
said
that.
what
the
opinion
said,
which
unfortunately
may
mean
nothing
unless
it's
promoted
to
the
status
of
majority,
is
you
look
to
those
factors
that
are
relevant
to,
known
to
both
policeman
and
the
suspect,
and
are
known
to
be
relevant
to
the
likelihood
that
a
person
--
a
likely
person,
not
him
--
that
are
known
likely
relevant
to
an
ordinary
person's
belief
--
this
kind
of
a
person
--
that
he
thinks
he's
free
to
go.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it's
right,
then
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
know
the
sentence
i'm
referring
to
in
my
dissent,
presumably?
we
hope.
when
i
have
set
forth
the
test
which
was
not
accepted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
--
i
live
always
in
hope.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
the
thing
about
known
to
both
and
relevant
to
a
likely
belief
as
to
whether
he's
in
custody
or
not.
now,
are
you
willing
to
accept
that
as
a
proper
statement
of
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then,
perfect.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
why
is
that?
we've
seen
two
cases
that
seem
like
blue
moon,
once
in
a
blue
moon.
alvarado
is
a
odd
set
of
circumstances.
and
what
is
the
terrible
thing,
the
awful
thing
that
has
to
happen
if
the
officer
isn't
sure
whether
this
individual
thinks
he's
in
custody
or
not?
suppose
the
officer
just
isn't
sure.
what
terrible
thing
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
answer
to
that
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well,
you
over
mirandize.
the
terrible
thing
that
happens
is
you
have
to
give
them
a
miranda
warning.
now
--
now,
that
is
the
terrible
thing.
now
--
now
--
now,
why
is
that
a
burden
on
the
criminal
justice
system
that
sometimes
in
ambiguous
circumstances
or
because
this
kid
is
very
young,
he
might
not
understand
it
quite
as
well,
and
the
officer
sees
that,
the
kid
sees
it,
and
so
the
officer
has
to
give
him
a
miranda
warning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
happens
to
destroy
the
criminal
justice
system?
you
can
see
from
my
overstatement,
i
tend
to
suspect
nothing,
but
you
tell
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not
the
first
thing,
hey,
kid,
we're
here
talking,
but
you
want
to
leave,
just
open
the
door
and
leave.
go.
nobody's
keeping
you
here.
why
isn't
that
the
first
thing,
if
he's
really
free
to
go?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
oh,
oh,
i
see,
i
see.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
not
free
to
leave?
okay.
well,
then,
why
not
warn
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
maybe
you
can
explain
this
to
me,
too.
you
have
a
blind
person
there.
everyone
--
you
don't
know
how
blind.
he's
somewhat
blind.
a
deaf
person.
how
hard
of
hearing?
we're
not
sure.
so
the
policeman
goes
a
little
overboard.
you
are
free
to
leave,
or
shows
it
to
him,
or
makes
sure
he
gets
it
in.
okay?
why
is
that
so
tough
to
do
where
you
also
have
a
12-year-old?
if
he
really
is
free
to
leave,
just
make
clear
that
he
knows
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
isn't
--
to
me,
anyway,
that
is
not
the
question.
i
don't
think
anybody
is
asking
anybody
to
think
like
anything
else.
all
it
is,
when
you
face
a
younger
child,
and
he
is
free
to
go,
and
you
mean
he's
free
to
go,
you
just
sort
of
err
a
little
bit
on
the
safe
side
and
make
sure
he
understands
it.
that's
all.
nobody
has
to
think
like
anybody.
all
they
have
to
think
is
let's
err
somewhat
on
the
safe
side.
now
why
is
that
tough?
