so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--are
you
saying,
going
back
to
the
hypotheticals
that
some
of
my
colleagues
posed,
police
officer
comes
across
an
individual,
looks
older
or
looks
younger,
doesn't
know,
and
just
engages
that
person
and
says
come
over
here
and
let's
talk
for
a
second.
is
the
officer
required
to
ask
the
age?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
they're
not
required--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--perhaps
not,
but
it's
--
if
it's
outside
a
school,
school
corner.
no
reasonable
suspicion,
just
says
come
over
here,
kid.
is
he
supposed
to
ask
the
age
to
see
if
he's
19
or
18
or
17?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
is,
because
it's
a
stop
with
no
reasonable
suspicion.
and
the
kid
comes
over,
and
the
officer
stands
him
there
and
continues
to
talk
to
him
for
half
an
hour.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
don't
we
go
back
to
the
test
that
justice
breyer
suggested,
which
would
answer
many
of
the
hypotheticals
here,
that
the
objective
fact
is
what
is
known
to
both?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
way
you
don't
get
into
what
the
13-year-old
is
thinking
inside
himself
or
not,
because
that
then
becomes
subjective;
you
don't
go
back
to
what
others
might
think
are
special
characteristics
or
subjective
characteristics.
you
go
to
what's
known,
what's
an
objective
factor
known
to
both.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
that's
clear,
but
that's
different.
i
mean,
you
can
tell
the
difference
between
a
9-year-old,
i
think,
and
an
adult
generally.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
i'm
hard
pressed
to
think
that
anyone
would
believe
that
if
you
took
a
9-year-old
out
of
his
classroom
and
the
assistant
principal
walked
him
into
a
room
and
said
these
guys
want
to
talk
to
you,
that
that
9-year-old
would
think
he's
free
to
leave.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
so
objectively
that's
a
fact
known
to
everyone,
that
it's
a
9-year-old.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me,
haven't
we
repeatedly
said
that
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
for
a
defendant
to
show
that
his
confession
wasn't
involuntary
if
there
was
no
miranda
violation?
isn't
the
entire
purpose
of
miranda
and
its
requirement
because
there
was
a
belief
that
it
wasn't
--
that
voluntariness
wasn't
enough
--
was
not
good
enough
because
it
was
such
a
high
bar,
to
secure
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
if
we've
said
if
you're
not
in
custody,
it's
going
to
be
nearly
impossible
for
you
to
show
that
your
statement
was
involuntary,
are
you
now
accepting
that
with
respect
to
age
a
9-year-old
may
not
feel
free
to
leave
as
opposed
to
a
13
or
14-year-old,
that
somehow
we
should
instruct
the
courts
that
age
really
needs
to
be
stepped
up
in
the
voluntariness
test?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
are
you
happy
with
the
rule
that
says,
no,
not
in
the
objective
miranda
test,
but,
yes,
age
should
be
elevated
as
a
prime
consideration
in
the
voluntariness
test?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
is
that
different
than
blindness
or
hearing?
a
person
with
down's
syndrome,
many
--
some
don't
--
show
characteristics
that
they're
not
capable
of
comprehension,
or
not
capable
of
absorbing
information.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
barely
look
at
you,
they
barely
--
you
know,
there
are
characteristics
that
show
you
a
lack
of
absorption
of
information.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
under
our
decision
in
miranda
versus
arizona,
a
suspect
must
be
warned
of
his
rights
before
being
subjected
to
custodial
police
interrogation.
a
suspect
is
in
police
custody
if
given
all
of
the
objective
circumstances
a
reasonable
person
in
the
suspect's
position
would
not
feel
at
liberty
to
terminate
questioning
and
leave.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
age
of
a
child
subjected
to
police
questioning
is
relevant
to
the
miranda
custody
analysis.
petitioner
was
a
13-year-old
child
attending
middle
school
classes
when
police
removed
him
from
his
classroom
and
escorted
him
to
a
school
conference
room.
there,
petitioner
was
met
by
school
administrators
and
an
investigator
with
the
local
police
force.
for
at
least
30
minutes,
petitioner
was
questioned
about
his
involvement
in
two
home
breakings
that
occurred
the
prior
weekend.
eventually,
petitioner
confessed
to
the
crimes.
petitioner
was
charged
with
breaking
and
entering
and
larceny.
he
argued
in
the
state
court
that
his
confession
must
be
suppressed
because
he
had
been
interrogated
in
a
custodial
setting
without
first
receiving
the
warnings
that
miranda
requires.
the
(inaudible)
trial
and
appellate
courts
rejected
this
argument.
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
affirmed
refusing
to
consider
petitioner's
age
as
part
of
that
custody
analysis,
we
reverse.
as
we
explained
in
our
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
conclude
that
a
child's
age
properly
informs
the
miranda
custody
analysis.
a
child's
age
is
an
objective
fact
that
would
affect
how
a
reasonable
person
in
the
suspect's
position
would
perceive
his
freedom
to
terminate
questioning
and
leave.
police
officers
in
courts
can
account
for
that
reality
without
compromising
the
objective
nature
of
the
custody
analysis.
so
long
as
the
child's
age
was
known
to
the
officer
at
the
time
of
police
questioning
or
would
have
been
objectively
apparent
to
a
reasonable
officer,
a
child's
age
properly
informs
the
miranda
custody
analysis.
the
judgment
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
the
state
courts
to
evaluate
whether
petitioner
was
in
custody,
when
police
interrogated
him,
this
time
taking
into
account
of
his
age
at
the
time.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
joined.
