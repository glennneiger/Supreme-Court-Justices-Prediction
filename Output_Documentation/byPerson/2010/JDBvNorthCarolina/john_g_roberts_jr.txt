we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-11121,
j.d.b.
v.
north
carolina.

the
whole
point--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
whole
point
of
the
miranda
rule,
i
thought,
was
to
provide
clear,
objective
guidelines
about
what
the
police
are
supposed
to
do.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
difficulties
with
your
rule,
however
clear
it
may
seem
in
this
case,
but
it
does
have
to
apply
more
broadly,
is
that
that's
off
the
table,
and
now
they're
not
only
going
to
have
to
know,
does
this
person
understand
it,
but
they're
going
to
have
to
know,
it's
not
every
one
of
these
situations
that's
going
to
be
in
school.
they're
going
to
have
to
guess
how
old
the
person
is.
and
there
are
differences.
some
15-year-olds
know
a
lot
more
than
some
17-year-olds,
and
so
on.
and
--
and
the
facts
that
you're
concerned
about
all
go
into
the
voluntariness
inquiry,
which
is
still
pertinent
after
miranda.
why
don't
we
just
put
those
facts
into
that
inquiry
and
say,
look,
we've
got
one
strict
rule;
everybody
knows
it,
you
hear
it
on
tv
all
the
time,
people
are
given
miranda
warnings;
that
part
of
it
is
done?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
it
be
--
is
it
enough
if
the
officers
in
this
situation
said,
look,
you're
free
to
leave,
you
know,
whenever
you
want,
but
--
and
then
goes
on
--
or
do
they
have
to
think
--
now,
maybe
--
maybe
a
13-year-old
really
doesn't
think
that's
true,
or
maybe
a
13-year-old
really
doesn't
feel
that
he
can
leave
if
he's
got
the
vice
principal
there
and
they
want
to
talk.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
thinking
it
would
not
even
be
enough
if
they
told
the
13-year-old,
look,
you
can
leave,
but
i
want
to
ask
you
some
questions.
and
the
principal
is
there,
and
he
thinks,
well,
you
know
--
maybe
the
13-year-old
is
thinking,
maybe
i'm
going
to
get
in
trouble
if
i
leave.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
that
relevant
to
the
miranda
inquiry?
it
might
be
relevant
to
the
voluntariness
inquiry,
but
i
don't
see
whether
you
call
the
parents
or
not.
part
of
his
miranda
--
your
miranda
right
is
not
to
have
your
parents
called.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
independent
of
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
right.
that's
my
whole
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
that,
no,
the
fact
that
a
parent
was
not
notified
is
not
relevant
to
the
miranda
question?
it
may
be
relevant
to
the
voluntariness
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
so
it's
not
just
that
they
have
to
call
the
parent;
they
have
to
wait
for
the
parent
to
show
up?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
--
that's
not
pertinent
to
the
federal
law
question
on
the
miranda
warnings.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
