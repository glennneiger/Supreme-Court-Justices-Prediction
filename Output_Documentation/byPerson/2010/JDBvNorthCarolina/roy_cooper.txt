mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
determining
custody
for
miranda
purposes,
this
court
has
considered
only
the
external
surrounding
circumstances
of
the
question
and
not
the
attributes
that
affect
the
mental
processes
of
the
person
being
questioned.
age
fundamentally
changes
the
reasonable
person
test,
makes
it
complex,
makes
it
more
illogical,
with
no
logical
stopping
point
for
adding
other
characteristics,
as
justice
breyer--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--this
court
has
not
said--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
obvious
circumstances.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
i
think
he
may
be,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
if
that's
how
you
want--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--yes.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
affects--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--your
honor,
i
am
willing
to
take
that
into
account.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
i
am
willing
to
take
that
into
account.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
your
honor,
because
those
are
obvious
circumstances
that
everyone
agrees--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--the
problem
is,
your
honor,
you
have
to
think
like
an
8-year-old
or
think
like
a
15-year-old
in
order
to
determine
the
situation.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
i
think
the
difference--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--the
difference
is
with
the
ukrainian
is
that
you
look
at
whether
the
knowledge
was
actually
acquired.
and
if
he
speaks
ukrainian,
then
everyone
knows
that
the
--
that
the
knowledge
was
not
acquired.
people
understand
that
someone
who
has
a
seeing
eye
dog,
if
you
take
him
out
of
the
room,
then
you
have
exerted
coercion
over
the
situation.
i
think
that's
different
from
requiring
the
officer
to
get
into
the
mind
of
the
reasonable
15-year-old
or
16-year-old.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
i
think--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
age--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--well,
no,
age
is
an
objective
fact,
but
what
--
what
they're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
use
age
in
a
way
where
you're
having
to
figure
out
what
a
--
what
that
person
would
think.
and
they're
using
age
as
an
overgeneralization
for
compliance.
there
are
lots
of
groups
that
would
be
naturally
more
compliant.
mentally
challenged
people,
seniors
in
rest
homes,
there
are
all
kinds
of
people
who
would
be
more
compliant,
but
compliance
doesn't
necessarily
equal
coercion.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
i'm
aware
of
it.
it
was
a
very
well
worded
dissent.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
i'm
willing
to
accept
that,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
i
am.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
but
i
don't
think
it
includes
age
in
the
way
they
want
to
use
it
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
well,
your
honor,
the
officer
may
not
know
the
age,
but
if
he
does,
in
this
situation
he
did,
and
--
and
if
the
officer
is
in
a
middle
school,
there
is
still
a
problem
with
having
to
figure
out
what
his
actions
and
how
they
--
what
they
are
and
how
they
affect
a
juvenile
of
a
particular
age.
in
the
situation
of
the
8-year-old
it
may
seem
intuitively
wrong,
but
the
issue
is,
is
you
have
to
get
into
the
mind
of
the
8-year-old,
makes
it
very
difficult
as
a
practical
matter.
the
officer's
going
to
have
voluntariness
problems.
if
the
officer
would
read
miranda,
the
officer
is
going
to
have
waiver
problems.
officers
have,
in
those
situations,
incentive
to
read
miranda,
to
get
a
parent.
in
--
in
--
in
this
type
of
situation
the
officer
went
there,
it
--
it
was
a
familiar
location
to
this
juvenile,
it
was
a
situation
where
he
knew
three
of
the
people
in
the
room,
the
officer
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
answer
questions,
and
he
said
yes,
the
interview
was
relatively
short.
the
juvenile
left
at
the
end
of
the
interview,
which
is
--
which
is
relevant,
and
i
think
in
this
situation
if
--
if
you
--
if
you
look
at
it
broadly,
it's
very
difficult
for
officers
to
tell
age
and
to
tell
how
age
affects
the
situation.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
your
honor,
he
probably
could
not.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
well,
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
you
look
at
the
school
setting
and
i
think
you
look
at--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
feeling
free
to
leave
somewhere
is
not
the
entire
test
for
custody.
there
has
to
be
a
restraint
on
freedom
to
the
degree
associated
with
the
arrest,
and
i
think
that's
pretty
clear
from
the
berkemer
case--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
a
reasonable--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--well,
a
--
a
reasonable
person
is
one
of
ordinary
reason
and
intelligence
who
knows
what
custody
looks
like,
essentially,
and
is
informed
by
45
years
of
case
law.
if
you
have
someone
who
is
very
young,
but
if
you
have
someone
without
any
other
kind
of
disability,
the
voluntariness
test
is
there.
it
--
it
considers
age
significantly
in
determining
whether
a
statement--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--well,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that,
but
the
voluntariness
test
was
complex
because
you
did
consider
so
many
factors.
so
the
court
lifted
the
miranda
test
out
of
the
voluntariness
test,
made
it
an
objective
test,
a
prophylactic
one,
clearly
a
different
test--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--well,
your
honor,
in
--
in
voluntariness,
you
don't
necessarily
have
to
have
custody
to
prove
that
a
statement
is
involuntary,
and
of
children
who
are
particularly
young,
that
will
come
into
play
significantly.
i
think
you
don't
have
to
get
into
turning
miranda
upside
down
in
order--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--justice
sotomayor,
i
think
it
is
already
a
significant
factor
in
the
voluntariness
test,
and
i
think
particularly
for
young
children,
i
think
you're
going
to
see
that
continue
to
occur.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
justice
kagan,
admittedly
sometimes
miranda
has
gray
areas,
because
you
do
look
at
a
combination
of
factors,
but
it's
informed
with
45
years
of
case
law.
and
officers
now
have
a
pretty
good
idea
as
to
what
combination
of
factors
constitute
custody
for
miranda
purposes.
what
age
does
is
now
we're
going
to
have
to
go
back
in
and
reassess
all
of
those
combination
of
factors
through
the
eyes
of
a
13,
14,
15-year-old,
16-year-old,
it's
going
to
be
case
law
that's
going
to
take--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--you
over
mirandize.
you
mirandize
when
it's
not
necessary.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
your
honor--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--a
lot.
school
resource
officers,
there
are
thousands
of
them,
they
are
--
they
are
licensed,
but
police
officers
--
uniform
police
officers
who
often
counsel
kids
as
well
as
protect
the
school.
under
the
petitioner's
theory,
a
school
resource
officer
who
is
going
to
take
a
juvenile
into
a
room
to
talk
about
a
stolen
cell
phone
or
bullying,
the
first
thing
that
he's
got
to
say
is
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent.
now,
that,
in
my
opinion,
disrupts
the
communication.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
well,
he
may
not
want
him
to
go,
number
one.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
well,
you
know,
you
want
to
talk
--
you
want
to
talk
to
the
kid.
if
you
have
a
traffic
stop,
you
don't
want
to
immediately
tell
the
15-year-old
driver,
you're
free
to
leave,
because
he's
not.
it's
just
like
berkemer.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
well,
no,
because
that's
a
berkemer
situation,
a
traffic
stop.
and
it
didn't--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
when
you're
dealing
with
voluntariness,
when
you're
dealing
with
consent
to
search,
when
you're
dealing
with
waiver,
you're
looking
at
the
particular
juvenile.
you're
looking
at
all
of
the
circumstances.
the
courts
have
said
that
the
miranda
test
is
different--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--well,
it
might--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--it
might
have
been,
in
this
circumstance,
that
he
didn't
own
the
house.
it
was
the
grandmother
who
actually
owned
the
house
as
to
why
he
needed--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--and,
your
honor,
you
are
right.
there
are
other
categorical
prohibitions
on
age
across
the
board
in
our
law,
but
here
what
we're
doing
is
asking
officers
to
assess
each
situation
based
on
the
particular
age
of
a
juvenile,
which
makes
it
all
the
more
difficult
for
the
officer.
you
know,
say
for
example
that
you're
at
a
terry
stop
and
there
are
a
number
of
juvenile-looking
people
there.
let's
say
they're
15
to
19,
but
the
officer
doesn't
know
it.
he's
at
the
terry
stop.
he's
going
to
be
faced
with,
potentially,
mirandizing
some
of
the
people
there
and
not
--
not
others.
that's
going
to
put
law
enforcement
in
an
untenable
situation
and
make
it
very
complex
for
them
as
to
when
they
read
miranda
and
they
don't.
and
i
think
in
addition
to--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--i
think
i
do,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--it's
an
obvious
external
circumstance.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
but
you
don't
have
to
get
into
the
mind
of
the
blind
person
or
the
deaf
person.
the
only
issue
is
whether
they
have
acquired
the
knowledge
in
order
to
be
able
to
put
it
into
the--
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
different
because
it
has
to
do
with
something
that
is
obvious.
it
is
not
necessarily
obvious
how
a
13
or
14-year-old
would
view
the
situation.
and
just
in
the
--
the
alvarado
opinion,
the
opinion
says
that
sometimes
the
permissible
objective
facts
and
impermissible
subjective
opinions
sometimes
merge.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
i
think
you're
absolutely
--
absolutely
right,
and
yes,
too,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
important
to
know
that
we
have
already
started
going
down
the
slippery
slope
in
a
number
of
states.
there
have
been
11
states,
contrary
to
petitioner's
brief,
that
are
considering
other
characteristics
in
miranda,
such
as
sophistication,
such
as
education,
such
as
intelligence.
that
makes
it
so
much
more
difficult.
and
this
court
has
not
hesitated
--
it
did
not
hesitate
in
alvarado;
it
did
not
hesitate
in
berkemer
--
to
correct
lower
courts,
to
say
we've
got
to
make
sure
that
miranda
is
complete,
that
miranda
stays
clear
and
objective,
and
that
we
don't
blur
the
lines.
mr.
roy
a.
cooper
iii
we
support
miranda,
your
honor.
we
support
miranda
in
its
current
form.
we
think
it's
appropriate,
but
i
think
clearly,
by
adding
age
into
the
circumstance,
it
makes
it
more
complicated.
your
honor,
i
would
--
justices,
i
would
request
that
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
decision
be
upheld.
