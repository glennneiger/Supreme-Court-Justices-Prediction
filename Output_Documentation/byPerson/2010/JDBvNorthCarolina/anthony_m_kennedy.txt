why
isn't
this
all
subsumed
under
the
voluntariness
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
at
least
it's
the
court
performing
it,
not
the
interrogating
officer,
as
justice
scalia's
questions
point
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
is
it
your
point
that
he
has
to
do
something
more
than
the
read
the
standard
miranda
warning?
suppose
he
read
the
standard
miranda
warning?
end
of
case
as
far
as
you're
concerned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
doesn't
it
follow
from
there
that
we
have
to
have
a
--
we
have
to
change
the
warning?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
part
of
my
problem
is
it's
just
in
some
respects
hard
to
put
the
miranda
in
the
context
of
a
--
let's
say
a
13-year-old
alone.
it
may
be
that
miranda
warnings,
"you
have
a
right
to
remain
silent,
anything
you
say
can
be
used
against
you.
"
--might
terrify
the
kid
just
to
hear
about
it.
i'm
just
wondering
how
the
miranda
warning
works
here
anyway.
the
school
is
in
loco
parentis,
it
has
certain
--
it
has
obligations
and
privileges
with
respect
to
the
student.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
say
associated
with
a
reasonable
man,
and
when
we
construct
the
reasonable
man,
you're
asking
me
to
think
of
a
25-year-old
sitting
in
a
seventh
grade
social
--
social
studies
class.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
little
hard
for
me
to
imagine.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
sorry.
i
just
--
the
only
statements
that
could
be
suppressed
--
i
just
didn't
hear.
