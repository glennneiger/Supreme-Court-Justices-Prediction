justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
asking
trial
judges
to
make
--
to
do
something
that
is
realistic?
do
you
think
--
let's
take
a
hypothetical
trial
judge
who,
let's
say,
is
60
years
old
and
has
an
iq
of
--
that's
at
least
an
average
iq.
and
now
you're
asking
this
trial
judge
to
decide
whether
under
particular
circumstances,
let's
say,
a
14-year-old
with
an
iq
of
85
would
appreciate
under
particular
circumstances
that
he
or
she
was
free
to
leave?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
think
a
trial
judge
can
really
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
must
have
greater
imaginative
powers
then.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
must
have
greater
imaginative
powers
than
i
think
i
would
have
under
those
circumstances.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
you
take
a
particular
set
of
circumstances,
and
the
judge
would
say,
if
i
were
13,
i
would
not
understand
that
i
could
go.
however,
if
i
were
15,
i
would
understand
i
could
go.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
you
slice
it
like
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
sympathetic
cases
can
make
bad
law.
so
take
the
same
set
of
facts
and
let's
hypothesize
that
this
is
a
15-year-old.
would
the
15-year-old
appreciate
that
he
could
go?
or
make
him
16.
or
make
him
a
street-wise
17-year-old.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
age
of
the
person
being
questioned
is
unclear?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
--
suppose
the
person
shows
an
id
and
it
shows
the
person
is
19
years
old,
and
the
officer
looks
at
him
and
says,
he
looks
like
a
pretty
young
19-year-old?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
--
i
mean,
under
my
example,
what
if
the
child
--
what
if
the
person
looks
like
a
minor
but
has
an
adult
id?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
the
officer
have
an
obligation
to
look
behind
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
or
the
other
way
around?
the
person
says,
i'm
15,
and
the
officer
sees
that
this
person
has
a
pretty
heavy
beard
and--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--could
i
go
back
to
an
earlier
question?
is
it
your
argument
that
age
is
the
only
objective
individual
characteristic
of
the
person
being
questioned
that
must
be
taken
into
account,
or
are
there
other
objective
characteristics
of
people
being
questioned
who
--
that
fall
into
the
same
category?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
are
they?
i
don't
want
to
use
up
your
rebuttal
time,
but
what
--
what
are
they
in
addition
to
age?
for
people
who
are
not
institutionalized
or
in
school
or
in
an
environment
like
that?
what
falls
into
the
same
category
as
age?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
law
goes
down
that
route,
then
one
of
the
chief
advantages
of
the
miranda
rule,
which
is
that
it's
a
relatively
simple
objective
test,
is
eliminated,
and
the
law
of
miranda
begins
to
resemble
the
law
of
voluntariness.
and
maybe
at
that
point,
there
is
no
longer
a
strong
argument
in
favor
of
miranda,
and
the
voluntariness
test
will
be
the
sole
test.
