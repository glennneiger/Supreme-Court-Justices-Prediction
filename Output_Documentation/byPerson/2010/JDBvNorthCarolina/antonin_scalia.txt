ms.
blackman,
i'm
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
clear
on
what
you
are
proposing.
is
there
to
be
one
different
miranda
requirement
rule
for
all
minors,
or
is
there
to
be
one
for,
what,
20-year-olds,
19-year-olds,
18-year-olds,
17,
16?
this
one
is
13,
do
we
calibrate
it
that
finely--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
do
we
just
say,
you
know,
what
would
a
minor
--
i
don't
know,
a
general
minor
regard
as
restrictions
upon
his
departure?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
mean
15,
14,
13,
13
1/2?
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
--
if
not
calibrated
by
age,
how
is
it
to
be
calibrated?
justice
antonin
scalia
common
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
--
and
how
--
how
is
the
law
enforcement
officer
going
into
the
confrontation
going
to
know
whether
a
judge
is
going
to
be
applying
a
15-year-old
rule,
a
13-year-old
rule,
or
whatever?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that's
clear?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
mental
deficiency,
if
--
if
age
should
be
one
of
the
factors,
deciding
whether
the
individual
regarded
himself
as
in
custody
or
not,
why
shouldn't
mental
deficiency
be
so
as
well?
is
there
any
--
any
basis
in
principle
for
not
--
i
mean,
once
you
do
this,
don't
you,
in
effect,
say
that
it
is
a
subjective
inquiry
whether
the
particular
individual
regarded
him
or
herself
as
being
in
custody;
isn't
that
the
--
the
basis
of
what
you're
arguing?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
why
is
age
different
from
mental
deficiency,
for
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
both
of
those
things
about
the
mentally
deficient.
they
may
regard
themselves
as
--
as
unfree
to
leave,
and
they
have
cognitive
deficiencies.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
--
even
if
you
said
no,
you're
pushing
us
there,
because
there's
no
basis
for
treating
a
childhood
any
differently
from
these
other
factors.
so
basically
you're
saying
justice
breyer
would
call
it
objective
circumstances.
you
know,
whether
you're
mentally
deficient,
i
would
call
that
the
subjective
condition
of
the
--
of
the
person
being
held
in
custody.
and
i
think,
i
don't
think
that's
what
we
meant
by
the
phrase
"objective
circumstances".
but
you
want
objective
circumstances
to
include
the
character
of
the
person
being
held
in
custody,
whether
he's
mentally
deficient,
whether
he's
schizophrenic,
known
to
the
police,
you
know,
whatever
factors,
right?
those
are
all
objective
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
need
empirical
data
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
need
empirical
data
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
show
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
closer
to
adulthood
a
child
is,
the
more
like
an
adult
he
is?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
when
the
policeman
sees
him,
he's
dressed
in
baggy
jeans,
you
know,
down
around
his
thighs,
and
when
the
judge
sees
him
he's
wearing
a
buster
brown
jumper
suit.
you
don't
really
think
that
it's
going
to
be
equivalent?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
parent
tells
them
not
to
leave?
what
if
the
parent
says,
you
go
and
talk
to
this
police
officer?
if
you
did
something
wrong,
i
want
them
to
know
about
it;
talk
to
the
officer.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
they're
not
an
agent;
they're
acting
as
a
parent.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
answering
my
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
a
good
faith--
justice
antonin
scalia
--does
a
good
faith
mistake
make
it
okay?
if,
you
know,
the
officer,
in
good
faith,
believes
that
it's
not
a
minor
and
--
and
proceeds
accordingly?
justice
antonin
scalia
some
people
don't
--
some
people
don't
read
the
sentence.
he
may
not
have
read
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
he
probably
couldn't
leave
the
classroom,
either,
could
he,
the
classroom
where
he
was
studying?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
--
the
additional
coercive
effect
of
not
being
able
to
leave
probably
didn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference.
he
knew
he
was
stuck
where
his
parents
had
put
him,
in
the
school.
and
if
the
school
sent
him
to
a
classroom,
he
had
to
be
in
the
classroom;
and
if
the
school
sent
him
to
a
place
where
he
could,
if
he
wished,
voluntarily
speak
to
the
police
officers,
he
had
to
be
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
blind
person
doesn't
have
a
different
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
deaf
person
doesn't
have
a
different
mind.
he
just
has
less
data,
and
it's
easy
to
take
account
of
less
data;
easier
to
take
account
of
less
data
than
it
is
to
take
account
of
how
different
one's
mind
is
because
he's
16
instead
of
13
or
whatever.
that's
the
difference
between
the
blind
and
the
deaf,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
officer
doesn't
have
to
think
like
a
13-year-old,
he
has
to
think
the
way
a
60-year-old
judge
would
think
a
13-year-old
thought,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
we
require
miranda
always?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
harm
in
requiring
it
always?
it's
always
easy
to
do.
why
don't
we
require
it
all
the
time?
can
you
tell
us
why
it
makes
a
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
want
miranda
warnings
to
be
given
where
they
are
unnecessary
because
they
are
only
necessary
to
prevent
coercion,
and
where
there's
no
coercion,
we
want
confessions,
don't
we?
and
the
miranda
warnings
deter
confessions.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
basic
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
cost-free
to
require
miranda
warnings.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
good
thing
to
have
the
bad
guys
confess
that
they're
bad
guys,
right?
