ms.
blackman,
what
is
complex
about
a
juvenile
investigator?
that's
what
this
police
officer
was.
so
he's
investigating
a
juvenile
for
juvenile
justice
purposes,
and
i
think
there's
hardly
anything
more
objective
than
that.
this
case
has
child
written
all
over
it.
it's
investigator
who
deals
with
children.
the
first
proceedings
is
going
to
be
a
juvenile
proceeding.
how
can
you
not
take
that
into
account,
whatever
--
whatever
these
other
factors
may
involve?
but
here
it
seems
to
me
so
rampant
because
this
police
officer
dealt
only
with
juveniles,
and
he
investigated
juveniles.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
be
one
relevant
factor
that
would
be
considered
was
that
nobody
called
the
parents?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
really
is
if
he
is
in
custody.
and
maybe
there's
something
different
about
being
in
the
room
with
a
juvenile
police
investigator
and
the
assistant
principal
and
being
in
that
same
room
with
your
parents
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
way
you
phrase
the
question,
you
say,
may
the
trial
--
whether
trial
courts
may
consider
the
juvenile's
age
in
miranda
to
make
the
in-custody
miranda
determination.
did
you
really
mean
"may",
so
it's
discretionary
with
each
judge,
whether
a
juvenile's
age
is
relevant
to
the
in-custody
analysis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
mean
by
use
it
in
this
situation?
this
is
a
middle
--
middle
school.
this
is
an
officer
who
deals
only
with
children.
i
can't
imagine
any
setting
where
age
isn't
more
apparent
than
when
dealing
with
an
assistant
principal,
a
juvenile
investigator,
going
--
deciding
--
the
juvenile
investigator
deciding
the
place
where
he
wants
to
conduct
this
is
in
a
middle
school.
i
mean,
just
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
how
can
you
say
that
we're
going
to
have
the
same
test
for
this
8-year-old
as
we
would
for
the
30-year-old?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we
look
at
what
is
the
normal
school
setting
just
like
we
looked
at
the
normal
business
settings,
he's
in
class,
all
the
children
are
around
him.
this
seventh
grader
was
marched
by
the
school
security
officer,
taken
away
from
his
peers,
from
his
class
in
--
put
in
a
room
with
a
closed
door
with
the
assistant
principal.
that
is
not
a
normal
part
of
the
school
day.
that's
not
where
he
is
required
to
be.
this
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
search
purposes,
is
age
consciousness
required?
remember,
a
part
of
this
is
the
police
officer
then
goes
to
the
boy's
home.
the
police
officer
is
trained
to
deal
with
juveniles.
and
he
says
to
the
boy,
you
can't
consent
to
the
search
because
you're
a
seventh-grader.
i
will
have
to
get
a
warrant.
so
please
stay
here
until
i
get
a
warrant.
if
he
can't
--
if
he's
not
treated
like
an
adult
for
purposes
of
the
search,
if
you
get
the
warrant,
if
the
police
need
a
warrant
because
they're
dealing
with
a
seventh-grader,
why
should
it
be
different
for
in
custody
for
miranda
purposes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
all
the
police
officer
was
looking
at
when
he
said
"i
have
to
get
a
warrant.
"
is
that
he's
dealing
with
a
seventh-grader,
not
all
the
circumstances.
very
simple:
age.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he's
under
the
age
of
consent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
can't
consent
to
a
contract.
he--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
limit
it
to
when
the
age
is
known.
if
we
limit
it
to,
this
is
an
officer
who
not
only
knows
he's
dealing
with
a
seventh-grader
but
he
decides
the
venue
for
the
questioning
is
going
to
be
a
room
in
the
school,
that's
--
it's
not
a
mystery.
it's
not
a
guess.
he
knows
he's
dealing
with
a
seventh-grader.
he
sets
it
up.
are
we
to
ignore
what
the
investigating
officer
knows?
the
investigating
officer
knows
he's
dealing
with
a
child.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--before
you
--
you
are
so
quick
to
answer
that's
right,
isn't
it
so
that
the
manual
that
this
very
officer
was
given
to
use
said
before
you
question
a
child,
give
miranda
warnings?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
apparently
the
people
who
train
these
juvenile
officers
think
it's
a
good
thing,
not
a
bad
thing
to
give
a
miranda
warning.
