mr.
eric
j.
feigin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
primary
reasons
why
age
should
not
be
a
factor
in
the
miranda
custody
test.
i
think
the
most
important
one
is
this:
the
only
statements
that
are
going
to
be
suppressed
under
petitioner's
rule
that
wouldn't
already
be
suppressed
by
existing
doctrine
are
statements
that,
first
of
all,
the
prosecution
has--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--the
only
statements
that
are
going
to
be
suppressed
under
petitioner's
rule
that
would
take
age
into
account
that
aren't
already
going
to
be
suppressed
under
existing
constitutional
doctrines
are
statements
that,
first
of
all,
the
prosecution
has
carried
its
burden
to
prove
are
voluntary
under
a
voluntariness
test
that
already
takes
age
into
account,
and
second
of
all,
are
given
under
circumstances
that
don't
otherwise
meet
the
definition
of
custody;
that
is,
formal
arrest
or
its
functional
equivalent.
i
think
that's
a
relatively
small
and
not
a
particularly
problematic
category
of
statements,
and
i
don't
think
it's
worth
complicating
the
miranda
rule
in
order
to
make
sure
that
those
statements
are
suppressed.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
critical
difference
between
blindness,
deafness,
and
other
sensory
disabilities
and
age
is
what
justice
scalia
said
a
few
minutes
ago,
which
is,
in
the
case
of
a
blind
or
deaf
person,
you
can
try
to
figure
out
what
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
interrogation
that
are
observable
to
that
person
are,
and
then--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
you're
doing
the
same
thing,
and
i
think
it's
easier
to
put
yourself
in
the
mindset
of
a
person
with
a
sensory
deprivation
than
a
person
of
a
particular
age,
and
let
me
explain
why.
for
a
person
with
a
sensory
deprivation,
like
in
justice
breyer's
example,
the
sign
that
someone
can't
read,
i
think
it's
very
common
and
easy
for
officers
and
courts
to
figure
out
how
they
would
react
to
the
situation
if
the
sign
simply
weren't
there.
with
age,
what
you're
asking
perhaps
a
45-year-old
officer
to
do,
in
justice
alito's
example,
or
a
60-year-old
judge
to
do,
is
to
put
them
into
the
frame
of
mind
of
a
person
that
they
haven't
been
for
32
years
or
45
years,
and
i
don't
think
that's
a
very
easy
inquiry
to
ask
officers
or
courts
to
make.
i
think
this
is
really
going
to
complicate
the
miranda
rule
by
asking
them,
a,
to
do
that,
and,
b,
because
there
are
going
to
be
many
cases,
unlike
this
case,
where
it's
not
going
to
be
apparent
to
the
officer
what
age
the
suspect
is.
one
thing
that
comes
up
fairly
commonly
in
many
jurisdictions
is
that
an
officer
will
stop
someone
on
a
--
do
a
traffic
stop
of
someone
on
the
road;
the
person
will
claim
not
to
have
their
id,
and
it
will
turn
out
the
person
is
14
and
they
will
give
the
name
and
birth
date
of
an
older
sibling.
and
there
is
simply
no
way
for
an
officer
in
those
circumstances
to
know
what
the
age
of
the
suspect
is.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
sort
of
two
parts
to
your
question.
let
me
deal
first
with
the
rule
that
would
only
apply
when
officers
know
the
identity,
know
the
age
of
the
suspect.
i
think
that
rule
would
be
easier
to
apply
than
the
rule
the
petitioners
are
suggesting
and
would
mitigate
some
of
the
damage,
but
first
of
all
it
doesn't
solve
the
critical
problem
of
asking
officers
who
aren't
themselves
13
to
think
like
someone
who
is
13;
and
second
of
all,
i
think
for
reasons
that
i
think
were
apparent
during
the
argument
by
my
friend
on
the
other
side,
that
rule
might
easily
devolve
into
a
"should
have
known"
test,
and
officers
simply
aren't
going
to
be
able
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
it
may
depend
what
--
which
particular
60-year-old
judge--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
main
problem
here
is
that
it's
going
to
create
more
confusion
for
officers
because
it's
another
factor
they
have
to
put
into
the
test,
and
it's--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--the
courts--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--i
think
it's
very
unrealistic
that
every
time
an
officer
opens
their
mouth
they
have
to
give
miranda
warnings,
and
i
think
it
would
fundamentally
change
the
nature
of
police
interactions
with
the
public.
the
court
--
and
the
other
reason
the
court
has
never
required
it
is
that
voluntary
statements,
the
court
made
clear
in
two
cases
last
term
again,
maryland
v.
jasper,
and
berkeley
v.
thompkins,
are
a
good
thing,
and
there
--
voluntary
confessions
are
a
good
thing,
they're
very
helpful
for
law
enforcement.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
and
there's
no
reason
to--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--please.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
i'm
not
sure
how
that
would
be
taken
into
account,
your
honor.
to
the
extent
that
someone
with
down's
syndrome
thinks
differently
from
someone
who
doesn't
have
down's
syndrome,
i
think
that
would
be
very
relevant
to
the
voluntariness
test
but
would
not
be
relevant
to
the
custody
test.
because
it's
--
again
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
to
ask
an
officer
to
put
themselves
in
the
mindset
of
someone
who
has
down's
syndrome.
i
think
the
--
the
third
problem--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
i
may
have
difficulty
dealing
with
this
particular
hypothetical
because
of
my
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
particular
symptoms
of
down's
syndrome;
but
if
you're
dealing
with
a
suspect
who
simply
can't
absorb
information
about
the
world,
then
that's
going
to
be
a
sensory
deprivation
that's
going
to
be
taken
into
account,
because
it's
going
to
subtract
circumstances
away
that
that
suspect
can't
perceive.
but
if
you're
asking
about
the
mindset
of
someone
that
has
a
particular
sensory
disability,
then
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
taken
into
account
because
it's
asking
too
much
of
officers
to
try
to
put
themselves
in
that
mindset.
and
the
third
problem,
i
think,
with
factoring
age
into
the
custody
test
is
that
--
and
as
i
think
petitioners
effectively
conceded,
it
creates
a
slippery
slope
problem.
there
really
isn't
a
clear
distinction
between
age
and
other
things
such
as
mental
disorders
or
cultural
background,
that
defendants
also
argue
change
whether
they
believe
that
they've
been
subject
to
a
formal
arrest
or
its
functional
equivalent.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
that's
right,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--that's
right--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--that's
right,
your
honor,
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
say
earlier.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
one
reason
they
may
think
it's
a
good
thing
and
one
reason
i
think
the
court
doesn't
need
to
accept
petitioner's
rule
here,
is
that
officers
often
will
give
miranda
warnings,
for
precisely
the
reasons
justice
sotomayor
was
suggesting
earlier,
which
is
that
when
officers
do
give
miranda
warnings,
it's
going
to
be
--
and
those
miranda
--
the
miranda
procedures
are
all
validly
followed,
there's
not
going
to
be
a
real
robust
voluntariness
inquiry
because
in
most
cases
where
the
miranda
procedures
are
followed,
the
statements
are
going
to
be
found
to
be
voluntary
under
the
voluntariness
test.
and
if
i
could
actually
add
answer
an
answer
to
justice
scalia's
earlier
question,
miranda
isn't
simply
concerned
with
coercion.
the
court
made
very
clear
in
oregon
v.
mathiason
that
miranda
isn't
attempting
capture
every
quote,
unquote,
"coercive
environment".
what
miranda
is
directed
at
is
a
specific
environment
--
thank
you.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
specific
environment,
namely
custody,
which
is
defined
as
a
formal
arrest
or
its
functional
equivalent.
thank
you.
