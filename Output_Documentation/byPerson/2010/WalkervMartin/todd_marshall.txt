mr.
todd
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
charles
martin
never
adequately
explained
why
he
waited
more
than
5
years
to
present
additional
claims
to
the
california
supreme
court.
as
such,
it
was
no
surprise
that
these
claims
were
rejected
as
untimely.
california
employs
a
habeas
corpus
timeliness
rule
that
merely
requires
reasonable
diligence
and
disclosure.
the
rule
is
adequate
under
this
court's
longstanding
precedents
in
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
to
the
contrary
should
be
reversed.
mr.
todd
marshall
three
brief
responses,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
to
measure
summary
denials,
you
can't
tell
from
a
summary
denial
ruling
what
the
court
was
thinking
about
the
time
of
delay.
the
second
point
is
that
delay
in
california
is
only
half
the
equation.
in
california
there
is
a
substantial
delay
and
there
is
also
the
justification
portion.
so
persons
who
operate
under
substantial
delay
still
have
an
opportunity
to
justify
that
delay
and
gain
the
desired
review.
mr.
todd
marshall
california's
policy
is
to
take
a
first
look
at
a
habeas
petition
and
determine
whether
it
has
a
prima
facie
case
or
whether
procedural
bars
are
apparent.
a
court
that
is
denying
a
case
on
the
merits
isn't
necessarily
saying
the
matter
was
timely,
and
courts
should
be
permitted
to
reach
whatever
is
the
most
judicially
efficient
method
of
resolving
such
a
question
without
it
being
held
against
them.
mr.
todd
marshall
no.
mr.
todd
marshall
no,
your
honor.
the
point
that
we
are
making
is
that
when
you
look
at
a
rule,
whether
you
apply
it
or
not
--
or
whether
you
impose
it
or
not
doesn't
mean
you
are
not
applying
the
rule.
for
example,
when
trial
courts
review
matters
under
the
fourth
amendment,
a
decision
not
to
exclude
the
evidence
doesn't
mean
that
they
didn't
apply
the
fourth
amendment.
in
this
case
if
the
trial
court
--
or
if
the
reviewing
court
looks
at
the
length
of
delay
and
then
they
may
look
at
the
justification
to
determine
that
the
delay
was
justified.
mr.
todd
marshall
the
california
supreme
court,
if
the
case
is
patently
meritless
--
and
perhaps
the
procedural
question
of
timeliness
is
more
complex.
mr.
todd
marshall
the
question
of
how
long
it
was.
mr.
todd
marshall
well,
the
state
court
has
discretion
to
determine
on
procedural
grounds
or
on
the
merits--
mr.
todd
marshall
--there
is
not.
mr.
todd
marshall
that's
correct.
mr.
todd
marshall
that's
correct,
the
lack
of
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
todd
marshall
that's
correct.
typically
the
citation
is
to
clark
and
robbins,
just
as
it
was
in
this
case.
mr.
todd
marshall
first
is
this
court
has
never
taken
the
position
when
measuring
adequacy
of
assuming
that
the
rule
is
inadequate.
the
starting
position
that
this
court
has
always
taken
when
looking
at
the
adequacy
of
a
state
rule
is
to
look
for
evidence
to
see
if
it
can
be
shown
to
be
inadequate.
and
i
posit
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
has
been
presented
to
show
that
the
state
court
is
using
their
rule
as
a
pretext
of
any
kind.
mr.
todd
marshall
i
posit
that
it's
not.
this
court
endorsed
in
lambrix
that
it's
all
right
for
courts
to
address
the
procedural
default
after
teague
if
that's
a
more
judicially
efficient
method
of
handling
the
matter.
strickland
cases
permit
addressing
either
prong,
whichever
is
easier
under
the
circumstances.
so
the
state
courts
ought
to
be
permitted
to
address
habeas
corpus
on
whatever
the
easiest,
most
judicially
efficient
basis
is
without
being
forced
to
answer
a
timeliness
question
if
a
case
is
patently
meritless.
and
there
should
be
no
finding
of
inconsistency
about
that.
and
more
importantly,
summary
denials,
as
we
are
discussing
here,
don't
afford
any
notice
to
litigants
of
what
the
state's
procedures
are
or
what
they
are
thinking
because
you
have
to
guess.
you
have
to
guess
at
how
long
the
delay
was,
you
have
to
guess
as
to
whether
there
was
any
justification
offered,
so
summary
denials
do
not
assist
the
inquiry.
and
this
court
has
never
endorsed
using
summary
denials
in
its
adequacy
measure.
this
court
has
always
looked
to
published
state
cases
that
explicate
the
rule.
this
court
is
looking
to
see
whether
the
rule
has
been
pronounced
by
the
state
for
a
certain
amount
of
time
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
litigant
that
is
receiving
the
imposition
of
the
rule
receives
a
rule
that
was
unexpected,
either
because
the
rule
was
changed
or
because
the
rule
was
novel.
nothing
like
that
has
happened
here.
mr.
todd
marshall
yes,
your
honor,
to
both.
the
kind
of
circumstances
you
are
describing
are
exactly
the
kind
of
circumstances
which
makes
california's
rule
fair,
because
it
considers
how
long
it
takes
a
litigant
to
find
his
claim,
get
it
prepared,
and
get
it
into
court.
there
are,
in
fact,
concrete
examples.
the
robbins
case
specifically
provided
that
a
5-month
window
from
the
discovery
of
triggering
facts
to
the
presentation
of
the
--
of
the
claim
was
a
reasonable
amount
of
time.
by
contrast,
the
stankiewicz
case
provided
that
18
months
of
delay
from
the
discovery
of
a
declaration
was
substantial
and
had
to
be
justified.
mr.
todd
marshall
certainly
he
hasn't
given
any
reason
why
he
didn't
present
his
additional
claims
at
the
time
of
his
earlier
habeas
corpus
challenges.
mr.
martin
went
through
a
full
round
of
superior
court,
court
of
appeal,
and
supreme
court
challenges,
and
then
waited
some
additional
years
and
has
never
explained
why
he
didn't
include
these
additional
claims
in
those
earlier
challenges.
mr.
todd
marshall
yes,
it
does
weigh
against.
and
it
is
a
rule
of
reasonableness,
and
it's
a
discretion-based
rule.
and
he
would
have
to
offer,
well,
why
didn't
he
include
those
claims
earlier?
and
if
he
had
a
good
reason--
mr.
todd
marshall
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
todd
marshall
california
has
articulated
that
successive
petitions
are
a
type
of
delayed
petition.
but
you
are
right,
there
is
a
difference
in
california
between
successive
petitions
and
delayed
petitions,
and
the
ruling
here
is
that
he
was
delayed
substantially.
i
was
just
addressing
the
point
about
when
they
might
have
been
timely
had
they
been
presented
earlier,
and
it
appears
that
in
the
earlier
--
he
didn't
get
a
timeliness
ruling
in
his
earlier
challenges.
so
it
appears
that
he
could
have
raised
them
then
and
did
not.
mr.
todd
marshall
it's
a
rule
of
reasonableness
and
diligence
that's
circumstantially
based,
and--
mr.
todd
marshall
--under
the
robbins
case,
it
explains
that
you
have
a
5-month
span
from
discovery
of
the
claims
to
presentation
of
the
claims
would
be
reasonable.
mr.
todd
marshall
there
isn't
--
there
isn't
a
defined
timeline.
but
our
position
is
that
a
defined
timeline
is
not
a
necessity
for
adequacy.
this
court
has
endorsed
reasons
of
--
rules
of
reasonableness
and
diligence.
for
example,
in
the
federal
prisoner
context
in
johnson
v.
united
states,
this
court
said
diligence
in
discovery,
while
it
isn't
exact,
is
good
enough.
mr.
todd
marshall
the
position
of
the
state
is
that
robbins
has
indicated
that
5
months
is
reasonable,
18
months
is
definitely
too
long,
and
that
there
is
a
discretion-based
determination
in
the
middle.
mr.
todd
marshall
he
would
point
to
the
published
authority
and
argue
that
his
case
was
outside
of
the
parameters
of
what
the
state
had
done
in
the
past.
however,
our
position
is
that,
since
california's
rule
is
adequate,
that
there
would
be
no
evidence
of
such
available
to
this
particular
litigant.
a
hypothetical
litigant
might
be
able
to
proffer
that
prior
cases
had
treated
claims
differently.
the
other
problem
with
california
is
that
it
would
require
two
exact
same
litigants,
and
it's
very
rare
for
two
exact
same
litigants
to
have
the
exact
same
claims,
the
exact
same
bases
for
their
delay,
and
file
exactly
the
same
amount
of
delay.
so
true
comparison
is
difficult.
mr.
todd
marshall
yes.
mr.
todd
marshall
respectfully,
i
must
disagree.
it
actually
is
the
other
way
around.
the
capital
case
policies
took
the
timeliness
rule,
took
the
general
timeliness
rule
for
themselves,
and
added
the
presumption.
mr.
todd
marshall
to
the
other
litigant
rule?
mr.
todd
marshall
they,
i
think,
felt
that
the
rule
was
adequate
the
way
it
was,
that
a
circumstantially-based
rule,
a
reasonableness-based
rule,
was
sufficient
to
guide
the
conduct
of
litigants
to
tell
them
what
they
needed
to
do
to
present
their
case.
mr.
todd
marshall
capital
cases
are
significantly
more
complex,
the
punishments
are
--
are
more
significant,
and
so
additional
scrutiny
might
be
warranted
in
those
contexts.
mr.
todd
marshall
i
didn't
follow
the
hypothetical.
was
--
were
some
of
the
hypothetical
individuals
getting
time-barred?
mr.
todd
marshall
and
some
of
the
individuals
were
getting
relief?
mr.
todd
marshall
is
there
yet
a
third
set
of
people
who
are
getting--
mr.
todd
marshall
--that
sounds
inconsistent
to
me,
your
honor.
however--
mr.
todd
marshall
--but
such
a
thing
would
not
occur
in
california.
mr.
todd
marshall
such
a
thing
would
not
occur
in
california.
mr.
todd
marshall
a
meritorious--
mr.
todd
marshall
--there
is
a
specific
exception
for
timeliness
in
california
to
preclude
fundamental
miscarriages
of
justice.
anybody
that
had
a
meritorious--
mr.
todd
marshall
--i
misunderstood
it.
mr.
todd
marshall
i
absolutely
agree,
your
honor.
the
basis
for
my
earlier
comments
was
the
--
i
believe
the
hypothetical
was
3
to
6
months,
which
was
a
much
shorter
period
of
time.
mr.
todd
marshall
just
as
occurred
in
this
case,
i
absolutely
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
todd
marshall
this
court
has
never
reversed--
mr.
todd
marshall
--first
of
all,
this
court
has
only
looked
at
the
treatment
of
this
individual,
not
disparate
treatment
of
prior
individuals.
the
--
the
rule
exists--
mr.
todd
marshall
--yes,
exactly.
no
one--
mr.
todd
marshall
--well,
i'm
not
sure.
it
doesn't
happen
in
california
that
way.
mr.
todd
marshall
all
right.
mr.
todd
marshall
it
doesn't
sound
like
it
would
be
adequate
under
this
court's
prior
tests.
mr.
todd
marshall
this
court
has
also
required
legitimate
state
interest,
and
this
court
has
used
the
legitimate
state
interests
context,
like
for
example
in
smith
v.
texas,
where
this
court
has
declared
a
particular
kind
of
violation
was
a
constitutional
violation
and
the
court
exercised
its
discretion
not
to
reach
the
violation,
this
court
found
that
the
state
had
no
legitimate
state
interest
in
such
a
ruling.
our
point
is
that--
mr.
todd
marshall
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
todd
marshall
yes,
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
todd
marshall
it
was
the
meritorious
nature
of
the
claims.
and
in
california
meritorious
claims
don't
receive
the
time
bar
because
there
is
exceptions
that
take
those
into
consideration.
mr.
todd
marshall
that's
correct.
mr.
todd
marshall
well,
in
california
there
is
no
such
evidence,
but
i
suppose
that
the
lawyer
could--
mr.
todd
marshall
--that's
correct.
mr.
todd
marshall
certainly.
mr.
todd
marshall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
todd
marshall
that's
correct.
mr.
todd
marshall
within
an
area
of
discretion,
like
for
example
the
finding
of
whether
a
piece
of
evidence
was
hearsay,
if
the
court
down
the
hall
finds
the
evidence
should
be
excluded
and
the
court
in
the
next
room
says
it
should
be
admissible,
that
is
not
necessarily--
mr.
todd
marshall
--california's
rule
is
perfectly
suited
to
such
a
scenario.
all
that
litigant
has
to
do
is
explain
why
they
didn't
bring
the
claim
sooner,
either
from
late
discovery
or
some
other
impediment,
and
the
substantial
delay
can
be
justified
with
exactly
those
sorts
of
circumstances.
mr.
todd
marshall
the
gallego
case
specifically
speaks
to
that
exact
circumstance
and
provides
that
if
you
have
a
good
faith
basis
in
investigating
further
triggering
facts,
you
may
withhold
the
claims
that
you
have
already
--
or
prepared,
to
prevent
piecemeal
presentation;
and
that
is
a
perfectly
acceptable
explanation
in
california.
mr.
todd
marshall
well,
other
than
the
robbins
decision,
which
speaks
of
5
months
as
being
reasonable,
the
court
has
tried
to
maintain
a
discretion-based,
circumstantially-driven
analysis
in
which
they
take
different
litigants
into
consideration.
one
litigant
may
be
in
a
maximum
security
prison
and
only
gets
to
go
to
the
library
once
a
month.
another
litigant
may
be
in
a
minimum
security
prison;
he
can
go
to
the
library
every
day.
those
two
litigants
are
going
to
be
different
and
should
be
treated
differently.
and
if
i
might
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
todd
marshall
this
court
has
explained
in
dugger
v.
adams
that
a
handful
of
inconsistent
cases
do
not
undermine
the
adequacy
inquiry.
and
unless
the
inconsistency
becomes
so
profound
that
it
undermines
fair
notice,
it
should
not
matter
that
there
are
some
different
rulings
that
can
be
shown.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
a
rule
that
has
a
bright
deadline
and
then
takes
into
considerations
after
the
deadline
is
somehow
preferable
to
a
rule
that
takes
into
considerations
discretionary
circumstances
in
the
first
instance.
and
unless
there
are
any
further
questions?
