justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
if
the
situation
were
such
that
a
lawyer
who
is
representing
a
client
and
has
to
figure
out,
has
there
been
too
much
delay
or
not,
suppose
he
looked
into
the
situation
thoroughly
and
he
said,
gee,
i
just
have
no
idea,
because
half
the
cases
come
out
one
way
and
half
of
them
come
out
the
other
way.
could
he
then
go
to
the
california
supreme
court
and
say,
"court,
look
what
you
have
been
doing?
"
and
would
the
court
then
grant
a
hearing
on
that
and
possibly
correct
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you
are
saying
there
is
no
such
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
suspected
from
reading
this.
but
if
there
were
such
evidence
is
there
a
route
in
california
that
they
could
deal
with
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
adequacy
of
notice,
because
no
notice
might
be
an
inadequate
notice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it's
absolutely
divided
50/50
you
have
no
notice.
you
don't
know
what
will
happen.
and
it
isn't
a
rule
to
say,
oh,
this
is
our
rule,
you
don't
know
what
will
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you,
we
are
in
hypothetical,
never-never
land
so
far.
but
it's
possible
your
opponents
will
convince
us
it's
real
land
and
not
never-never
land.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
puzzle
to
me.
i
mean,
justice
scalia's
question
was
courts
all
the
time,
they
all
the
time,
they
don't
decide
an
issue
of
whether
it's
filed
too
late
because
it's
the
simplest
thing
just
to
decide
the
merits.
it's
the
same
result.
and
sometimes
they
don't
do
that.
but
that
happens
often
in
a
district
court
on
appeal
and
triple
in
a
supreme
court
which
has
hundreds
or
thousands
of
questions
for
review.
so
how
do
we
know
that
that
simple
practice,
which
i
have
never
heard
of
as
attacked
as
unconstitutional,
how
do
we
know
that
that
isn't
what's
going
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
--
they
--
what's
your
point?
800
are
silent.
what
does
that
show?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
can
make
any
claim
against
him.
what
i
wonder,
maybe
this
is
where
i'm
leading,
the
california
supreme
court
is
not
the
only
court
in
california
where
people
file
for
habeas
petitions,
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
so
why
if
there
is
inconsistency
in
this
rule,
wouldn't
somebody
go
look
at
the
decisions
in
the
appellate
courts
which
write
the
reasons
down,
and
then
you
would
know
whether
it
is
being
decided,
applied
consistently
or
not
inconsistently.
why
look
at
a
blank
wall?
why
not
look
at
people
who
write
opinions
and
then
you
will
find
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
of
course
not.
but
is
your
claim,
are
you
conceding
or
are
you
conceding,
are
you
denying,
are
you
just
saying
nothing
about
whether
the
practice
in
this
rule,
applying
the
rule
of
substantial
unexcused
delay
disqualifies
you
for
--
that's
the
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
are
you
saying
it's
being
applied
consistently
or
inconsistently
or
you
do
not
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
all
courts
below
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
do
not
know.
so
what
you
have
done
your
research
on
are
questions
that
cannot
be
answered
due
to
the
fact
that
a
supreme
court
normally
doesn't
say
why
when
it
denies
something,
but
you
haven't
looked
into
the
research
that
is
readily
obtainable,
which
is
these
are
courts
that
write
opinions.
have
i
gotten
that
correctly?
because
if
that's
correct--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
then
i
don't
see
why
you
didn't
because
it
would
be
easy
if
you
are
right
to
show
this
from
the
lower
courts,
but
of
course
if
you
are
wrong,
it
wouldn't
be
easy,
then
a
blank
wall
is
better
than
nothing.
now,
what
can
you
say
that
will
disabuse
me
of
the
notion
that
i
just
expressed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
something
called
sampling
techniques
and
sampling
techniques
are
designed
to
limit
the
burden.
i'm
not
saying
it
wouldn't
be
burdensome,
but
you
have
examined
thousands
of
cases.
so
i'm
back
to
my
original
question
and
statisticians,
many
of
whom
would
like
to
help
you
perhaps
if
you
could
find
some,
could
do
this
for
you,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
wrong
court.
and
amicus
did
it
from
the
time
that
the
case
was
filed,
while
the
rule
is
you
start
the
period
of
running
from
the
case
when
the
person
should
reasonably
have
known
his
issue,
which
isn't
the
same
time
as
the
time
his
case
was
divided
against.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
like
having
rules;
when
you
have
rules
and
say
60
days
or
90
days,
you
find
impossible
cases
that
you
should
have
heard
because
it
was
the
91st
day
or
it
was
the
92nd
day,
and
then
you
give
the
people
equitable
discretion
to
depart
from
it,
and
pretty
soon
you
get
litigation
over
that.
i
mean,
there
is
no
perfect
system.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
go
back
to
the
lower
courts.
if
there
really
is
a
problem
here,
why
wouldn't
the
bar
look
into
how
well
this
practice
is
working
in
the
lower
courts
and
find
out,
well,
what
is
the
practice?
how
do
they
use
it?
do
we
want
more
flexibility?
do
we
want
more
definite
rules?
i
agree
that
you
put
your
finger
on
a
problem,
an
important
problem,
i'm
not
at
all
certain
that
the
one
system
is
better
or
required
or
compulsory.
