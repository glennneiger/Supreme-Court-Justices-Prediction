justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
charge
that,
yes,
we
can
agree
with
you
that
in
general
5
years
seems
like
a
long
time,
but
we
have
a
brief
from
the
habeas
corpus
resource
center
that
says
that
in
the
5
to
6-year
delay
category,
62
percent
are
dismissed
on
the
merits,
and
that
you
can't
tell;
sometimes
they
do
have
merit,
sometimes
they
do
it
as
time-barred,
and
there
is
no
rationale
to
when
they
do
one
or
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
they
have
to?
would
they
have
to
justify
the
delay
first?
i
thought
there
was
something
about,
well,
if
the
time
question
is
more
difficult,
the
merits
are
easy,
there's
no
merit,
so
we
just
decide
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
in
california,
if
it
just
says
"denied"
then
the
presumption
is
that
it
is
denied
on
the
merits,
is
that
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
it's
going
to
be
denied
on
time
bar
grounds
there
has
to
be
something
to
indicate
that
it's
for
that
reason.
otherwise
we
assume
it's
on
the
merits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
was
taken
over
by
california
from
capital
cases,
but
in
the
capital
case
context
they
have
a
90-day
presumption
of
timeliness.
and
when
they
extended
the
capital
framework
to
non-capital
cases,
they
left
out
the
presumption
that
within
90
days
is
timely.
was
there
a
reason
for
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
a
reason
for
then
saying,
well,
in
the
capital
context,
we
are
going
to
make
it
clear
that
90
days
--
90
days
is
timely.
why
didn't
they
add
that
to
the
original
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
would
it
be
different
in
the
capital
context?
what
was
the
reason
for
adding
the
90
days
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
suppose
--
suppose
california
has
a
rule
that
said
you
have
to
file
within
one
year
of
the
finality
of
the
conviction,
absent
good
cause
for
the
delay.
if
that
were
the
rule
that
california
had,
your
client
certainly
would
be
untimely
and
you
wouldn't
have
a
leg
to
stand
on,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
there
is
a
requirement
of
prompt
--
as
promptly
as
circumstances
permit,
wouldn't
a
person
know
that
5
years
is
not
as
prompt
as
circumstances
permitted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
this
come
about
because
it
was
returned
--
this
was
not
--
i'm
thinking
about
--
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
make
any
claim
that
he
was
diligent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
didn't
make
any
claim
that
he
was
diligent
in
filing
it
5
years
late.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
can't
you
take
the
brackets
of
--
what
was
it,
5
months
is
reasonable
time;
18
months
is
not
a
reasonable
time.
mr.
martin
falls
outside
of
the
18
months.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was
a
decision
that
18
months
was
too
long.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
decision
that
said
18
months
is
too
long.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
california's
time
limitation
on
applications
for
postconviction
relief.
the
question
presented:
â€œdoes
california's
requirement
that
habeas
corpus
petitions
be
filed
as
promptly
as
possible
qualify
as
an
independent
state
ground
for
denying
relief
adequate
to
bar
a
subsequent
application
for
the
same
relief
in
federal
court?
unlike
most
states,
california
does
not
employ
fixed
statutory
deadlines
to
determine
the
timeliness
of
a
state
prisoner's
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
instead,
california
directs
petitioners
to
file
known
claims
without
substantial
delay.
petitioners
are
further
instructed
to
state
when
they
first
learned
of
the
claims
they
are
asserting
and
to
explain
why
they
did
not
advance
those
claims
sooner.
claims
not
presented
as
promptly
as
the
circumstances
allow
may
be
denied
as
untimely.
california
courts
signal
that
a
habeas
petition
is
denied
as
time
barred
by
citing
the
california
supreme
court's
controlling
decisions,
in
re
clark
and
in
re
robbins.
but
denial
of
a
petition
for
undue
delay
is
a
may,
not
a
must.
a
california
court
has
discretion
to
pass
over
the
question
whether
a
petition
was
filed
too
late
and
simply
deny
the
petition
for
want
of
merit.
petitioner
below,
respondent
here,
charles
w.
martin
presented
claims
for
postconviction
relief,
allegations
that
his
counsel
had
provided
ineffective
assistance
in
a
habeas
petition
filed
in
the
california
supreme
court,
nearly
five
years
after
his
conviction
became
final.
habeas
petitioners
in
california
can
file
directly
in
the
supreme
court.
they
need
not
climb
up
the
judicial
ladder
to
get
there.
martin
gave
no
reason
for
the
long
delay
in
asserting
the
ineffective
assistance
claims.
citing
clark
and
robbins,
the
court
denied
martin's
petition.
in
turn,
the
federal
district
court
dismissed
martin's
federal
habeas
petition
raising
the
same
claims.
denial
of
martin's
state
court
petition
as
untimely
the
district
court
held
rested
on
an
adequate
and
independent
state
procedural
ground.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.contrasting
the
precision
--
precision
of
fixed
statutory
deadlines,
for
example
one
year
but
california's
no
substantial
delay
formulation
a
federal
appeals
court
held
that
california's
standard
lacked
the
clarity
and
certainty
necessary
to
constitute
an
adequate
state
bar.
we
reversed
that
judgment.
in
a
2009
decision,
beard
--
beard
against
kindler,
this
court
clarified
that
a
state
procedural
bar
may
qualify
as
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
for
denying
a
federal
habeas
petition
even
if
the
state
court
had
discretion
to
omit
ruling
on
the
procedural
barrier
and
instead
ruled
on
the
merits.
guided
by
that
decision,
we
hold
that
california
is
not
put
to
the
choice
of
imposing
a
specific
deadline
for
habeas
petitions
which
would
almost
certainly
rule
out
martin's
nearly
five-year
delay
or
preserving
the
flexibility
of
it's
current
practice
but
at
a
considerable
price,
opening
the
door
to
federal
habeas
review
and
thereby
undermining
the
finality
of
state
court
judgments.
in
ruling
for
california,
we
stress
that
martin
has
not
alleged
that
the
state's
time
bar,
either
by
design
or
in
operation,
discriminates
against
federal
claims
or
claimants.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
