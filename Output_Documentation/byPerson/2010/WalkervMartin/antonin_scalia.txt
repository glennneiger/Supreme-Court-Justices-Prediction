justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
some
federal
rule
that
says
you
have
to
apply
a
procedural
ground
before
you
decide
the
merits?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
up
to
california
which
of
the
two
it
wants
to
use?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
isn't
that
a
separate
rule?
i
mean,
no
matter
how
soon,
if
he
does
it
a
week
after,
doesn't
california
have
a
rule
that
you
can't
come
back
with
another
habeas
with
material
that
you
could
have
produced
in
the
--
in
the
former
habeas?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
time
--
time
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
it's
just
a
separate
--
a
separate
bar.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
5
years
is
too
long,
though?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
no.
why
do
you
concede
that
it
would
be
--
can't
the
state,
if
it
wishes,
give
grace
to
people
who
did
apply
late,
but
because
the
case
is
so
meritorious
or
for
any
other
reason?
the
issue
is
whether
those
people
who
filed
5
years
later
and
knew
that
it
was
very
late,
whether
they
are
entitled
to
have
their
cases
heard,
not
whether
the
state
allows
somebody
who
filed
6
years
earlier
to
have
it
heard.
how
does
that
do
any
injustice
to
the
person
who
knew
that
5
years
was,
you
know,
you
are
likely
to
be
denied?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
the
state
has
to
be
consistent
in
it.
if
--
as
a
matter
of
grace,
it
can
--
it
can
allow
some
people,
so
long
as
the
people
who
are
denied
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
were
coming
in
too
late,
and
5
years
is
coming
in
too
late.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
the
cases
that
you
are
using
in
which
we
insisted
upon
adequacy
in
the
sense
of
equal
treatment
of
equal
people
are
cases
in
which
the
effect
of
the
state
decision
was
to
exclude
the
matter
from
federal
--
from
federal
supervision.
the
matter
could
not
come
before
the
federal
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
something
quite
different.
this
is
applying
a
time
limit.
i
don't
see
why
we
have
to
apply
the
same
rule
and
--
and
look
into
the
--
whether
it's
not
discretionary.
i
mean,
to
say
it's
discretionary
always
means
that
sometimes
similar
cases
may
be
treated
differently.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
don't
know
why
you
--
you
concede
that
--
that
we
take
an
adequacy
rule
that
is
used
for
one
purpose
and
should
apply
it
to
a
totally
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
none
of
this
is
--
is
a
device
as
is
used
in
the
cases
that
--
that
you
are
referring
to
that
go
into
adequacy,
a
device
to
exclude
the
federal
courts
from
the
case.
that's
--
that's
not
what's
going
on
here,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
a
question
of
adequacy,
is
it?
it's
a
question
of
notice.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
cases
that
you
cite,
before
you
go
any
further,
are
cases
in
which
the
california
supreme
court
came
out
with
an
opinion
saying
that
six
years
was
okay?
or
are
they
just
cases
where
without
an
opinion
the
california
supreme
court
went
to
the
merits?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
they
were
decisions,
written
opinions
or
just
went
to
the
merits
and
decided
the
merits?
did
they
say
anything
about
the
delay
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
side
says,
unless
there
is
an
opinion,
the
reason
they
may
have
gone
to
the
merits
is
--
was
just
a
lot
easier.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
that
california
had
just
adopted
this
rule,
this
rule
that
habeas
petitions
have
to
be
filed
as
promptly
as
circumstances
permit.
they've
just
brand-new
adopted
it.
and
you
are
the
lawyer
for
somebody
who
says,
you
know,
i
think
i'm
going
to
wait
5
years.
don't
you
think
that
even
if
there
were
no
california
law
on
the
subject,
you
would
know
that
his
habeas
claim
is
going
to
be
denied?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
really
need
case
law
to
tell
you
that
5
years
is
not
as
promptly
as
circumstances
permit
when
you
--
when
you
have
no
justification?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
you
can't
have
a
first
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
reasonable
men
differ
about
5
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
better
be
careful
about
what
you
wish
for
because
i
am
not
sure
that
the
kind
of
system
that
is
being
proposed
is
going
to
be
better
for
habeas
applicants
than
the
one
that
california
now
has.
we
really
don't
know
that,
do
we?
