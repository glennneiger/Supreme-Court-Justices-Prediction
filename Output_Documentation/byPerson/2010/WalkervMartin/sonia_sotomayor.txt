justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
basically
you
are
taking
the
position
or
you
are
conceding
that
the
california
courts
are
not
consistent
in
their
application
of
the
timeliness
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
brief
doesn't
even
try
to
defend
that
position.
are
you
conceding
that
there
is
inconsistent
application
of
the
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well
--
i
might
be
speaking
for
her,
but
i
thought
that
the
habeas
corpus
resource
center
brief
showed
that
the
court,
the
california
court,
did
reach
some
cases
where
an
explanation
had
not
been
proffered.
and
so
it
can't
be
just
a
simple
rule,
that
if
you
don't
proffer
an
explanation
you
won't
get
heard.
so
what's
the
next
step
in
that?
why
do
they
reach
some
and
not
others?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
could
it
be
complex
when
there
is
no
justification
offered?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
they
pointed
to
a
certain
number
of
cases
that
were
5
years
or
above
in
delay
where
no
justification
was
offered,
and
in
some
they
reached
the
merits
and
in
others
they
applied
a
procedural
bar.
so
how
is
that
consistent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
we
know
that
the
california
court
just
thinks
that
the
federal
question
is
too
hard
and
it
doesn't
want
to
reach
it?
it
may
be
meritorious.
how
do
we
know
they
are
not
applying
the
decision
to
reach
the
merits
on
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
basis
or
one
that
seeks
to
avoid
hard
federal
questions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
claims
here--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
a
little
bit
confused
by
your
response
to
justice
scalia.
i
thought
from
your
brief
that
you
were
positing
that
there
was
no
claim
of
inconsistent
application
of
the
rule
that
could
ever
survive.
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
the
following
hypothetical,
and
probably
not
far
off
the
mark.
litigants
who
don't
know
the
law,
who
claim
they
are
not
educated
in
it,
say
that
they
have
just
learned
about
a
new
california
case
that
gives
them
a
ground
to
challenge
their
prior
sentence.
and
the
litigants
learn
about
the
case
anywhere
between
3
and
6
months
of
the
issuance
of
the
case
by
the
supreme
court.
a
dozen
litigants
apply
for
this
discretionary
review
and
half
of
them
are
granted
review
and
half
are
not.
half
of
them
get
a
correction
of
the
sentence
and
half
of
them
don't.
there
is
no
difference
between
them
that's
discernible.
they
each
just
claim
ignorance.
is
that
a
case
where
someone
would
be
out
of
luck,
and
why,
for
a
claim
of
inconsistent
application?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
getting
time-barred.
some
are
time-barred;
some--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--exactly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
some
--
all
of
them
are
within
that
small
framework
of
3
to
6
months
from
the
time
the
supreme
court
decision
was
issued.
they
all
claimed
they
just
learned
of
it
and
filed
immediately,
and
some
are
getting
relief
and
some
are
not.
is
that
an
inconsistent
application
that
would
be
cognizable
under
your
view
of
the
rule
as
it
should
be?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
does.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
what?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
the
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
is:
what
rule
do
you
want
us
to
impose
and
how
does
that
rule
capture
that
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
not
answering
my
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it
doesn't
answer
why
inconsistent
application
among
similarly
situated
individuals
should
not
provide
an
avenue
of
relief.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
5
years
is
different.
i'm
talking
about
treatment
of
similarly
situated
individuals
differently.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
oh,
i
don't
disagree
with
you.
so
that
the
question
i
have
for
your
adversary
is
whether
or
not
he
can
point
to
any
case
where
a
litigant
who
proffered
an
--
something
that
was
evident
on
the
trial
record
and
on
the
appellate
record
was
ever
granted
a
merits
review
after
5
years.
because
i
don't
see
them
proffering
any
case
that
shows
that.
but
--
and
i
think
that
may
be
your
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
what
did
you
present
below,
or
what
has
habeas
corpus
resource
center
presented?
a
case
with
a
5-year
delay
where
the
claimed
errors
are
apparent
on
the
trial
record
and
the
appellate
record,
and
no
justification
for
the
delay
is
proffered.
those
are
the
three
seminal
facts
that
go
to
the
requirements
of
robbins
and
the
other
supreme
court
--
other
california
supreme
court
cases.
do
you
have
one
case
that's
similar
where
the
court
went
to
the
merits?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
was
that
someone
who
made
the
claim
based
on
the
trial
and
appellate
record
with
no
justification?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
uh-huh.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
is
the
solution
for
california
to
say,
if
you
delay
more
than
a
year
from
when
you
should
have
known
you
are
barred,
except
we
will
excuse
it
for
any
number
of
reasons?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
would
be
a
regularly
and
consistently
applied
rule
in
your
mind?
that
would
be
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
pro
se
litigants
who
don't
know
deadlines
generally
are
going
to
live
with
knowing
that,
what?
