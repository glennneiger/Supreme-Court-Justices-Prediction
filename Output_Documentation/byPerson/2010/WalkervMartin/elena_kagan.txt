elena
kagan
when
does
the
state
think
that
mr.
martin's
claim
became
untimely?
justice
elena
kagan
so
you
think
it--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
if
we
can
take
out
the
second
and
successive
aspect
of
this
and
just
focus
on
the
timeliness,
when
does
the
state
think
that
this
--
that
these
claims
became
untimely?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
you
have
the
circumstances
here,
so
under
those
circumstances
when
did
the
claims
become
untimely?
justice
elena
kagan
the
5
months
would
be
reasonable.
so
is
a
year
unreasonable?
is
5
months
the
outer
bounds,
you
know,
assuming
you
don't
have
a
good
reason?
i
understand
that
if
you
have
a
good
reason,
that
can
lengthen
it.
but
suppose
you
don't
have
a
good
reason.
when
does
the
state
think,
okay,
that's
too
late?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i'm
trying
to
get
to
even
around,
not
--
not
exact.
my
standard
is
not
exact.
it's
just
around.
around
what?
around
6
months,
around
3
years,
around
someplace
in
the
middle?
justice
elena
kagan
what
happens
if
a
--
a
person
in
this
position
is
trying
to
investigate
multiple
claims
at
once,
and
some
of
them
are
ready
to
be
put
before
the
court
and
others
are
not?
how
does
he
know,
look,
i
really
better
get
in
there
right
now
and
put
whatever
i
have
before
the
court;
or
look,
i
have
a
little
bit
more
time
in
order
to
investigate
some
of
my
claims
further?
how
does
he
make
that
determination?
justice
elena
kagan
why
is
it,
mr.
marshall,
that
the
--
the
california
courts
have
not
been
a
little
bit
more
transparent
about
what
the
presumptive
time
limits
are?
you
know,
look,
it's
around
a
year
unless
have
you
a
good
reason.
you
know,
at
least
we
are
taking
3
years
off
the
table.
i
mean,
why
don't
we
have
decisions
like
that
from
the
california
courts
that
would
--
would
help
folks
here?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
bigelow,
is
that
right?
i
take
your
point
that
nobody
can
say
exactly
when
mr.
martin's
claims
became
untimely,
but
five
years
is
untimely,
isn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
if
there
is
a
very
good
reason,
but
five
years
without
an
explanation
is
--
why
is
that
a
hard
question?
justice
elena
kagan
why
was
this
petition
not
filed
for
5
years?
justice
elena
kagan
why
--
why
was
this
petition
not
filed
for
5
years?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
bigelow,
isn't
this
similar
to
the
rule
that
governed
federal
habeas
review
prior
to
aedpa?
a
similar
kind
of
delay
standard,
whatever
"delay"
means?
