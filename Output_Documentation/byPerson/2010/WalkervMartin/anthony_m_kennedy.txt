justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
a
court
to
take
the
ground
of
least
resistance,
to
decide
the
cases
on
the
easiest
issue
that's
presented?
is
that
arbitrary
and
capricious?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
phrase
is
"substantial
delay".
are
there
factors
other
than
temporal
factors
that
go
into
whether
or
not
the
delay
is
substantial;
that
is
to
say,
the
prisoner
had
difficulty
contacting
his
counsel
and
so
forth?
is
that
what
the
court
looks
at
when
it
looks
at
"substantial"?
and
is
there
--
are
there
california
cases
that
tell
us
how
do
we
define
"substantial"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
supposed
to
be
filed
within
60
days.
i
don't
--
this
is
along
the
same
lines
as
justice
kagan's
questions.
suppose
there's
the
first
round
of
habeas
and
then
he
waits
60
days
and
files
the
new
claim.
would
that
be
substantial?
because
you
are
indicating
that
failure
to
include
it
in
the
first
review
is
a
factor
to
be
weighed
against
him,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
justice
is
inquiring
about.
