mr.
michael
r
bigelow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court:
the
adequacy
inquiry
is
framed
by
asking
whether
the
state
rule
in
question
is
firmly
established
and
regularly
followed.
at
its
core
is
the
prevention
of
state
courts
from
declining
to
enforce
federal
rights
and
to
maintain
federal
authority
over
the
protection
of
constitutional
rights
in
the
supremacy
clause.
in
its
brief
at
page
7,
the
state
would
seem
to
agree
that
a
rule
is
inadequate
unless
earlier
decisions
of
the
state
court
are
at
least
consistent.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
sanders
was
a
5-year
case
that
is
cited
in
my
brief.
jones
was--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--i
will
speak
to
justification
in
just
a
moment,
if
i
may.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
jones
was
an
eight
year
case.
the
amicus
brief,
the
resource
center
cited
cooper,
duke
and
hardiman.
cooper
was
a
five
year
case.
those
were
both
iac
claims
which
appear
to
--
with
respect
to
the
sanders
and
the
jones
case,
i
cannot,
i
do
not
know
specifically
what
the
claim
was
as
i
stand
here
and
i
apologize
for
that.
but
let
us
look
at
justification
for
just
a
moment.
the
justification
offered
in
those
cases
was
that
the
habeas
petitioner
was
ignorant
and
had
no
counsel.
now,
i
will
represent
to
you
that
in
the
state
of
california
99.9
percent
of
the
lawyers
--
the
lawyers
--
99.9
percent
of
the
petitioners
who
file
aren't
represented
by
counsel
and
are
not
lawyers
themselves
and
i
would
represent
further
that
probably
98
percent
or
99
percent
have
no
more
than
a
12th
grade
education.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
they
are
--
well,
in
the
sanders
case
and
in
the
jones
case,
there
were
i
believe
they
were
decisions,
in
--
they
were
decisions.
these
cases
predated
the
clark
robbins
situation.
in
the
cooper
case
and
the
duke
case,
those
cases--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--they
did
say
something
about
the
delay
question
in
at
least
two
of
the
cases,
well,
at
least
in
one
of
the
cases,
the
mitchell
case,
which
was
a
two
year
delay,
they
said
two
years
was
unreasonable,
but
i
didn't
cite
those
and
i
cannot
speak
to--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--to
that
extent,
it's
my
recollection
they
went
to
the
merits.
they
are
not
silent
denials
and
they
don't
cite
clark
robbins
because
they
predated
clark
robbins.
with
respect
to
the
cooper
case
and
duke
case,
those
i
believe
were
silent
denials.
now,
and
that's
the
interesting
thing
about
california.
we
are
presuming,
we
are
presuming
and
this
court
has
reached
that
presumption,
that
they
are
merit
denials
when
they
are
silent,
but
we
really
don't
know.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
well,
in
--
in
any
given
year
recently
--
in
recent
history
at
least,
there
are
about
800
truly
silent
denials,
no
explanation.
now,
the
state
says,
we
can't
consider
them
because
they
mean
nothing.
from
our
perspective,
they
have
to
mean
something,
and
they
have
to
count
because
we
don't
have
the
information
that
the
litigant
in
this
matter
doesn't
have
the
same
kind
of
resources,
for
example,
that
the
state
does.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
that
they
have
got
to
count
in
the
adequacy,
in
the
consistency
application
they
have
got
to
count
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
because
the
petitioner
is
the
one
who
has
the
resources--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--no.
the
appellate
court--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--not
all
--
not
all
habeas
petitions
in
california
are
filed
in
lower
courts.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
that's
the
rule.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
it
is
being
applied.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
in
all
courts
below,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
that
would
be
a
correct
thing.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
the
--
the
lower
appellate
courts,
there
are
six
--
there
are
six
district
courts,
there
are
six
appellate
districts,
i
guess,
within
the
state
of
california.
and
who
knows
how
many
superior
courts.
for
a
petitioner
to
examine
the
holdings
and
the
rulings
in
each
of
those
districts
would
be
virtually
impossible
for
a
petitioner
who
is
in
prison,
who
is
unrepresented
by
counsel,
and
let's
not
forget
that
non-capital
habeas
petitioners,
and
this
is
non-capital
habeas
petitioners,
is
not
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
amicus
did
it
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--that's
an
excellent
point
the
court
makes.
and
it
is
that
--
nobody
in
this
room,
nobody
in
this
room
can
tell
this
petitioner,
this
litigant
when
this
petition
was
filed
late.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
that
--
it
is
not
a
scenario
that
is
likely
to
happen.
but
the
construct
that
the
court
has
--
as
promptly
as
circumstances
would
allow,
shows
up
in
a
footnote
in
a
capital
case.
that--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--that's
the
state
rule
that
they
proffer.
that
is
the
rule
that
the
state
proffers.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
that
rule
is
so
vague
and
unknown
in
the
context
at
least
of
the
habeas
litigation,
no
one
understands
what
that
rule
means.
how
prompt
is
prompt?
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
five
years
is
not
untimely
if--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--even
with
an
explanation,
five
years
is
not
beyond
the
pale
of
cases
that
have
been
previously
decided
and
with
respect
to
similarly
situated
litigants.
other
cases
in
california
--
and
don't
forget,
please,
that
the
habeas
corpus
research
center
took
only
a
small
sample
of
a
single
day
and
that
was
the
day
that
martin's
decision
came
down.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
there
was
no
justification
with
respect
to
mr.
martin's
petition,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
i
would
disagree.
i
think
that
they
did,
in
fact,
look
at
explanations
for
delay,
and
a
curious
thing
that
they
did
find
which
is
in
their
brief
is
that
even
though
--
cases
which--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--i
think
the
short
answer
to
that
is
yes,
but
they
also
looked
at
silent
denials
as
well.
so
they
found
that
where
there
was
no
explanation
for
delay,
more
of
those
cases
were
decided
actually
on
the
merits
than
cases
that
did
offer
a
delay.
so
there
is
a
--
a
gross
inconsistency,
a
gross
inconsistency
between
the
need
for
justification
of
delay.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
it
wouldn't
be
a
problem.
that
would
be
a
discretionary
rule
if
there
were
guidelines;
if
there
were
guidelines--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--oh,
if
they
went
back
with
decisional
law,
decided
the
range?
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
i
would
be
in
a
lot
more
tenuous
position
arguing
this
case
if
there
was
some
guidance
to
litigants
with
respect
to
what
does
constitute
a
reasonable
time
period
within
which
to
file.
what--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--if
that
were
the
rule,
the
petition
would
have
been
filed
timely.
that
is
my
answer.
that
is
my
answer
to
that
question.
had
that
time
period
been
known,
the
petition
would
have
been
filed
timely.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
there
has
--
my
answer
is
no,
because
in
california
there
are
no
guidelines.
that
came
in
the
clark
decision,
which
was
1993,
and
nothing
has
been
decided
in
the
state
of
california
to
define,
to
clarify,
to
narrow
what
constitutes
"promptly".
what
constitutes
"promptly"?
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
the
record
is
--
does
not
speak
to
that
point
specifically.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
there
were
no
claims
made
excusing
the
--
excusing
the
filing
at
that
time
period.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
if
this
were
a--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--decisional
law
is
what
our
system
is
all
about,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
no,
i
think
you
can
--
i
think
you
can
have
a
first
case
so
long
as
--
so
long
as
the
standard
itself
is
not
so
vague--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--that
reasonable
--
that
reasonable
men
--
so
long
as
reasonable
men
are
able
to
understand
the
standard.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
well--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--if
i
recall,
the
standard
was
prejudicial
delay,
if
i
recall
correctly.
and
prejudicial
delay,
if
i
am
correct,
is
a
quantifiable
standard.
it
is
a
standard
that
had,
over
the
years,
come
to
be
understood.
there
was
a
shared
expectation
with
what
prejudice
encompassed.
and
so
yes,
it's
similar,
but
it's
not
exact.
it's
not
the
standard
in
california.
and
if
i
may,
california
clearly
understands
that
case
law
can
offer
guidance
to
litigants.
in
in
re
harris,
a
case
cited
by
both
of
us,
by
both
parties,
the
state
of
california
was
concerned
about
the
waltrius
rule,
which
is
another
procedural
bar.
and
it
went
on
to
--
it
acknowledged
that
it
wasn't
clear
at
that
time
and
it
went
on
to
explain
what
the
waltrius
rule
was
all
about
and
why
it
was
needed.
and
in
another
case,
where
recently,
the
state
of
california
--
in
a
case
not
cited,
the
kelly
case;
it's
a
2006
case
--
the
california
supreme
court
directed
its
lower
courts
over
which
it
supervises
to
provide
greater
detail
in
their
analysis
of
wende
briefs,
which
is
the
state's
alternative
to
the
anders
brief,
in
order
to
provide
guidance
to
litigants,
to
provide
guidance
to
justices,
and
to
provide
--
to
provide
guidance
to
the
federal
courts
who
may
be
called
upon
to
determine
procedural
bars.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
judge-made.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
so
a
rule
in
a
footnote
in
a
capital
case.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
no.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
yes.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
just
not
the
parameters
of
the
rule.
and
the
parameters
of
the
rule,
the
guidelines
which
guide
judges,
which
guide
litigants,
is
just
simply
not
there
in
california,
either
with
respect
to
that
rule
or
with
respect
to
substantial
delay.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
the
--
had
the
--
never.
had
the
rule
been
applied
even-handedly,
had
the
rule
been
applied
consistently,
it
would
certainly
be
more
adequate.
however,
and
getting
back
to
justice
scalia's
point,
it
has
never
been
clearly
defined,
so
it
does
not
clearly--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--in
--
that's
not
--
that's
not
this
case.
the
rule
hasn't
been
--
the
rule
has
not
been
thoroughly
set
out;
at
--
at
least
the
guidelines
haven't
been
set,
and
it
might
be--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--certainly
one
--
one
could
do
that,
but
that
hasn't
been
established
as
the
brackets,
and
it
is,
after
all,
california's
rule.
and
it
is
california
that
--
which
needs
to
make
that
determination.
now
it's
--
it's
not
as
if
california
hadn't
actually
tried
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
not
a
decision
that
said
that.
these
were
extrapolated
--
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
there
was
a
decision
that
said
a
16-month
period,
but
that
was
pre-clark.
that
was
a
pre-clark
decision
that
actually
did
say
16
months
after
all
is
not
a
particularly
long
period
of
time.
and
another
decision
--
i
beg
your
--
i
beg
the
court's
pardon
--
another
decision
said
that
two
years
was
not
a
particularly
long
period
of
time.
but
those
are
--
those
are
pre-clark
decisions,
if
you
will,
and
this
case
is
relying
upon,
or
the
state
act
rather
is
relying
on
what
has
come
after
--
after
clark
with
respect
to
its,
as
promptly
as
the
circumstances
should
allow.
but
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
it's
not
as
if
the
state
of
california
doesn't
understand
the
need
for
a
finite
period
of
time
to
provide
guidance
to
--
to
all
parties.
in
--
in
saffold,
the
state
requested
this
court
presume
a
filing
period,
i
think
it
was
--
i
want
to
say
60
days.
more
recently
in
chavez,
a
filing
period
was
requested
to
be
presumed
again
by
the
state.
on
both
occasions
this
court
declined
because
it
isn't
this
court's
prerogative
to
set
rules
for
the
state.
what
this
court
did
do
is
it
certified
the
question
to
the
state
of
california,
or
they
asked
the
ninth
circuit
at
least
to
certify
the
question
to
the
state
of
california.
the
ninth
circuit
did
exactly
as
this
court
asked
it
to
do,
and
certified
the
question,
and
the
state
of
california
says:
"we
are
not
going
to
tell
you
what
a
timeliness
period
is.
"
now
that
doesn't
help
pro
se
litigants
with
minimal
education,
without
benefit
of
counsel,
who
are
the
vast
majority
of
habeas
petitioners
in
the
state
of
california.
they--
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
--approximately
2,500,
give
or
take.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
approximately
2,500,
based
on
a
lexisnexis
kind
of
search.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
that's
the
problem.
the
test
that
is
applied
without
guidelines,
without
any
kind
of
guidelines,
the
judicial
discretion
--
judicial
discretion
is
informed
discretion,
it
is
not
discretion
--
it
is
judgment
pursuant
to
known
guidelines,
it
is
not
a
judgment
issued
pursuant
to
inclination.
and
the
concern
is
that
with
this
kind
of
amorphous
standard,
inconsistent
and
arbitrary
application
is
impossible
to
enforce.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
discretion
to
depart
from
a
rule
that
has
been
violated
is
one
thing.
here
there
is
no
quantifiable
or
known
parameters
within
which
discretion.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
certainly.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
well,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
consistently
applied
until
we
are
down
the
road
and
we
learn
how
consistently
it
has,
in
fact,
been
applied,
but
certainly
it
would
be
an
appropriate
rule.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
we
--
if
--
if
we
collectively
screamed
and
yelled
when
aedpa
passed
with
its
one
year
statute
of
limitations,
we
have
learned
to
live
with
it,
and
we
meet
the
deadlines
because
we
know
what
the
deadlines
are.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
they
have
got
a
better
chance
--
they
have
got
a
better
chance
of
meeting
deadlines
if
they
know
what
those
deadlines
are,
and
there
is
nothing
to
take
--
there
is
nothing
to
take
the
flexibility
from
the
california
supreme
court
if
there
is
a
deadline.
mr.
michael
r
bigelow
the
red
light
is
going
to
go
on
in
an
about
a
minute.
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
the
most
powerful
court
probably
in
the
world
requested
clarification
of
the
rule
and
didn't
get
it.
i
don't
know
who
else
is
going
to.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions?
