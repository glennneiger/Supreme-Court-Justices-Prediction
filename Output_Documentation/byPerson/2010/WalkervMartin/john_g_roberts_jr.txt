chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear,
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
09-996,
walker
v.
martin.
mr.
marshall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
was
the
third?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
for
it
to
be
real
--
just
so
i
understand
--
for
it
to
be
real,
you
have
to
have
a
defense
counsel,
a
client
comes
to
him
with
a
non-frivolous
federal
habeas
claim,
and
the
defense
counsel
says,
i
can't
tell
whether
we
are
going
to
be
barred
by
this
time
rule
or
not.
some
courts,
looks
like
we
will;
some
don't.
so
what?
of
course
he
is
going
to
file
the
federal
habeas
and
see
if
it's
determined
to
be
adequate
or
inadequate,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bigelow.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
everybody
in
this
room
can
tell
him
that
he
is
obligated
to
file
the
petition
as
promptly
as
the
circumstances
allow.
he
has
complete
notice
of
that.
and
if
he
wants
to
go
and
do
the
research
and
say,
well,
here's
one
where
they
let
it
in
after
five
months,
but
here's
one
where
they
didn't
leave
it
in
after
nine
months,
so
he
sits
here
and
decides
i'm
going
to
wait
nine
months
and
put
my
money
on
that
court.
that
is
not
a
scenario
that's
likely
to
happen,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
not
challenging
that
as
the
state
rule,
are
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
they
didn't
look
at
possible
justifications
at
all,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i'm
not
asking
about
mr.
martin's.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
--
the
analysis
that
the
amicus
undertook
simply
looked
at
the
chronological
time.
they
did
not
consider
the
fact
that,
for
example,
somebody
with
three
years
might
have
had
an
explanation;
somebody
with
one
year
might
have
not
had
any.
and
they
may
view
those
cases
as
different
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
did
they
look
--
did
they
look
for
explanations
for
delay
when
you
had
the
one-sentence
denial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
much
range
are
you
willing
to
give
the
state?
do
they
have
three
months'
range?
i
mean,
if
you
come
in
and
say,
well,
here
they
were
filed
in
nine
months
and
they
were
allowed,
and
here
they
were
filed
in
six
months
and
they
were
not
allowed.
is
that
a
problem
under
our
consistency
requirement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
says
"as
promptly
as
the
circumstances
allow.
"
and
they
go
back
and
say
there
is
a
range,
a
three-month
range.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
do
the
same
sort
of
research
you
have
done
here,
and
you
find
out
that
--
that
there
is
a
three-month
range.
sometimes
--
i
mean,
there
are
cases
and
you
can
show
a
lot
where
they
are
allowed
at
nine
months
and
then
you
find
cases
that
are
not
allowed
under
six
months.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
i
understand
that
you
would
have
a
much
stronger
case
if
you
were
dealing
with
a
judge-made
rule
about
timeliness.
if
the
courts,
on
their
own
authority,
said,
look,
we
are
not
going
to
look
at
things
that
are
filed
four
years
late
because
that
prejudices
the
state,
it
prejudices
us,
et
cetera.
but
here
you
have
something
different.
you
have
a
rule,
right?
an
established
rule:
promptly
as
circumstances
allow.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
judge-made,
but
it's
been
around
for
a
long
time.
this
isn't
a
new
rule
that
is
just
coming
in.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let
me
get
back.
i
tried
to
--
when
you
made
that
point
earlier,
i
wanted
to
follow
up
on
it.
your
claim
is
not
that
you
don't
know
or
defendants
in
california
don't
know
that
the
rule
is
"as
promptly
as
the
circumstances
allow.
"
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
thought
you
had
fair
notice
of
that
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
marshall,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
