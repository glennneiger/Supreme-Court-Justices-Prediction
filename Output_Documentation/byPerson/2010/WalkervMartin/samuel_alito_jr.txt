justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
it's
filed
within
6
months
and
it's
rejected
as
untimely,
and
the
petitioner
wants
to
try
to
demonstrate
that
this
represents
a
grave
departure
from
the
way
these
are
normally
handled
by
the
california
supreme
court?
is
there
any
way
for
the
petitioner
to
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
understand
your
answer,
then.
you
have
--
let
me
just
adapt
what
justice
sotomayor
said.
you
have
--
a
case,
a
supreme
court
case
is
decided.
and
you
have
ten
--
ten
habeas
petitioners
in
california
who
file
on
exactly
the
same
day.
and
five
of
them,
if
you
were
to
get
to
the
merits
of
their
claim
under
this
new
decision
of
this
court,
five
of
them
would
be
entitled
to
relief,
five
of
them
would
not
be
entitled
to
relief
on
the
merits.
and
the
california
supreme
court
holds
that
the
five
who
would
be
entitled
to
relief
are
procedurally
barred
and
the
five
who
were
not
entitled
to
relief
are
not,
and
they
are
rejected
on
the
merits.
now
would
that
be
an
adequate
state
ground?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i
know
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
would.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
it
were
to
happen,
would
that
be
adequate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
fair
notice
is
not
the
only
requirement.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
your
argument
that
the
california
timeliness
rule
was
never
an
adequate
rule,
never
can
proceed,
never
can
bar
consideration
of
a
federal
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
mr.
walker
had
waited
20
years;
would
it
still
be
inadequate
as
to
him?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
many
of
these
petitions
are
filed
each
year
in
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
approximately
what?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
with
that
many
petitions,
is
there
any
possibility
that
a
multifactor
test
such
as
the
one
that
california
is
applying
could
be
applied
with
any
degree
of
regularity,
unless
there
is
some
sort
of
secret
internal
guidelines
that
are
being
applied
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
deciding
this?
