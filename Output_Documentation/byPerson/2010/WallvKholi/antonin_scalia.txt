justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
your
argument
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
phrase
"post-conviction
or
other
collateral
review"
means
post-conviction
collateral
review
or
pre-conviction
collateral
review.
isn't
that
what
is
added?
"post-conviction
or
other";
what's
"other"
from
"post-conviction"?
i
guess
it
would
be
pre-conviction,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
and
is
this
direct
review?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
collateral
review?
so
--
so
you
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
that
if
--
if
there
is
anything
to
the
point
you
are
making,
it
hinges
not
on
the
"post-conviction
or
other
collateral"
phrase,
but
rather
on
the
word
"review".
i
suppose
it
could
be
argued
that
you
are
not
reviewing
the
judgment
if
you
are
asking
for
mercy.
whether
the
judgment
was
good
or
bad,
you
are
asking
for
mercy.
and
i
would
--
you
know,
perhaps
it's
not
review.
is
that
your
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
only
because
all
the
cases
we've
had
involved
that.
we've
never
had
a
case
like
this
before.
so
in
all
those
other
cases,
we've
used
the
natural
term
"collateral
review".
that
doesn't
mean
it
couldn't
apply
to
this.
it
just
means
we've
never
had
occasion
to
inquire
whether
it
applies
to
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
--
then
think
you
are
saying
that
it
only
gets
reversed
for
abuse
of
discretion,
right?
and
that's
a
legal
ground,
it
seems
to
me.
and
i
don't
know
how
you
could
say
that
that's
a
plea
for
leniency.
it's
a
plea
that
the
sentencing
court
abused
its
discretion
and
should
have
given
a
lesser
sentence.
how
is
that
leniency?
it's
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
to
have
to
figure
this
out
case
by
case,
or
even
jurisdiction
by
jurisdiction,
as
to
whether
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
review
or
leniency
review
or
this
or
that.
and
that
--
that
makes
me
inclined
to
say
we
should
treat
your
rule
35
as
coming
within
the
tolling
provision,
so
we
don't
have
to
grapple
with
--
i
mean,
i'm
not
having
very
much
success
understanding
the
distinction
that
you're
telling
me.
i'm
don't
want
to
have
to
do
this
for
50
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
either
--
either
your
victory
will
give
you
absolutely
nothing
or
you
have
truly
stupid
defendant
lawyers
in
rhode
island.
i
mean,
why
would
anybody
not
caption
the
35
motion
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
to
lose?
you
say
it
doesn't
matter
if
your
claim
of
an
illegal
sentence
is
frivolous
or
not.
what
is
to
lose?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you've
said
that
this
could
be
done
before
finality.
i
thought--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
sure
you
said
that
earlier,
that
this
motion
can
be
made
before
the
judgment
is
final.
didn't
you
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
what
you
just
said.
you
just
said
after
the
finality.
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
it
says--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
we
need
a
new
adjective
then,
because
i've
always
thought
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
review,
direct
and
collateral.
you
say
there
is
a
--
a
tertium
quid.
what
do
you
want
us
to
call
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
maybe
doesn't
need
to
be
called
anything
because
it
doesn't
exist.
i
--
i
can't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--imagine
anything
that
isn't
either
direct
or
collateral.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
any
indication
in
the
case
law
what
a
reasonable
time
consists
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be
right
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
reason.
i
--
i
thought
we
had
held
that
the
word
"filed"
in
the
petition
means
filed
in
a
court,
not
filed
with
the
governor.
it's
--
it's
the
word
"filed"
in
--
in
the
tolling
provision
that
--
that
does
the
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
this
was
--
if
this
motion
had
been
filed
before
judgment,
which
can
happen,
before
the
judgment
is
final,
then
there
would
be
no
tolling?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
answer
is
yes.
this
motion
which
can
be
filed
either
before
or
after
judgment,
the
time
is
tolled
if
it's
made
after
the
judgment
but
not
if
it's
made
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
--
that's
not
what
the
state
says,
anyway.
the
state
says,
and
i
think
the
way
35
reads,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
filed
after
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
it
can't
be
filed
any
later
than
that.
but
it
doesn't
say
that
it
can't
be
filed
before
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
does
--
when
does
it
become
final?
when
does
the
--
even
at
the
trial
court
level,
when
does
it
become
final?
