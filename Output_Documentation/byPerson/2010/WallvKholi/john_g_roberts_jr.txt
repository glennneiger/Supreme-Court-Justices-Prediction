chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-868,
wall
v.
kholi.
mr.
weisman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
those
different
than
the
characteristics
that
the
sentencing
judge
looks
at
in
the
first
instance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
how
these
--
you've
obviously
seen
a
lot
of
these
and
i
haven't
seen
any,
but
i
mean,
do
the
rule
35
motions
typically
say
--
do
they
typically
concede
the
legal
validity
of
the
sentence
and
then
simply
say
--
what?
i
mean,
i
assume
the
sentencing
is
completely
open
and
you
can
put
in
anything
at
all,
like
the
deprived
childhood,
the
unique
situation,
the
age,
whatever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
what
sense
is
rule
35
different
from
the
arguments
that
are
made
at
sentencing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
bad
for
you,
isn't
it,
for
the
very
point
that
justice
kennedy
was
raising?
if
it's
the
same
sort
of
arguments
that
you
get
to
raise
as
a
legal
matter
prior
to
the
imposition
of
sentencing,
why
should
they
not
be
considered
legal
matters
when
they
are
raised
under
rule
35?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
those
issues
that
can
be
--
that
are
typically
raised
on
direct
--
direct
review?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
mizner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you
just
call
your
motion
a
motion
to
correct
an
illegal
sentence?
then
we
wouldn't
have
any
dispute
here,
i
gather.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
not
one
of
the
stupid
lawyers
that
we
were
worried
about
before.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sure
of
that.
but
you
do
think
that
if
you
had
--
if
you
or
whoever
files
these
motions
had
simply
said
that,
there
would
be
no
problem,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
because
you
want
something
other
than
legal
review,
right?
you
want
to
throw
yourself
on
the
mercy
of
the
court.
you
have
got
plenty
of
avenues
to
correct
the
illegality
of
the
sentence,
but
this
is
something
different,
right?
this
is
to
--
not
correct
--
you
admit
it's
illegal,
but
you
say
it
should
still
be
reduced
for
a
lot
of
reasons.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
raise
all
of
those
--
all
of
those
claims
under
the
normal
state
collateral
post-conviction,
state
habeas,
all
those
other
thing,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
guess
i'm
having
trouble.
you
can
--
the
various
grounds
on
which
the
sentence
should
have
been
lower
than
it
was,
including
the
fact
that
setting
the
sentence
at
that
level
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
you
obviously
can
raise
those
at
sentencing
and
you
can
raise
those
on
direct
review,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you
challenge
it
on
--
in
state
habeas?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
only
vehicle
you
have
--
that's
the
only
vehicle
you
have
for
challenging
the
sentence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
may
have
asked
this
already,
but
it
seems
unusual
to
me
so
i
want
to
make
sure
the
answer.
you
have
a
client
who
is
convicted
of
a
particular
offense
that
results
in
a
sentence
of
what,
zero
to
5
years,
okay?
and
the
judge
in
imposing
the
sentence
engages
in
racial
discrimination.
it
turns
out
that
he
sentences
african
americans
to
5
years
and
caucasian
defendants
to
2
years.
that
you
are
telling
me
is
a
claim
that
you
cannot
raise
on
direct
review
or
on
--
in
state
habeas?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
say
it
"would
be
raised".
are
you
saying
it
can
only
be
raised
under
rule
35?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
i
would
have
thought.
so
rule
35
is
not
the
only
vehicle
for
challenging
a
sentence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
the
question
--
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
cut
you
off
--
is
not
that
this
is
a
question
of
abuse,
that
it
may
be
a
good
thing.
the
idea
is
you
have
got
a
motion
for
reduction
of
sentence
because
of
mercy,
and
the
judge
might
say:
well,
i'm
inclined
to
exercise
mercy
if
you
come
out
of
the
rehab
program
in
a
good
way,
if
it
turns
out
after
the
first
several
months
that
you
are
a
model
prisoner.
in
other
words,
it's
not
a
question
of
abuse,
it's
a
good
thing;
and
if
we
start
saying
that
the
time
for
federal
habeas
is
tolled,
judges
might
be
inclined
not
to
exercise
such
charity
based
on
the
prisoner's
conduct
after
conviction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
120
days,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
for
filing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
weisman,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
