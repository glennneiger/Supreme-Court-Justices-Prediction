ms.
judith
h.
mizner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
circuit
here
correctly
held
that
khalil
kholi's
motion
for
a
reduction
of
sentence
under
rhode
island
rule
35
was
an
application
for
state
post-conviction
or
other
collateral
review
with
respect
to
the
pertinent
judgment
or
claim.
as
such,
it
tolled
aedpa's
1-year
limitation
period
and
mr.
kholi's
petition
was
timely
filed.
we
look
to
the
common
usage
and
ordinary
understanding
of
the
words
of
the
tolling
provision
in
the
context
of
the
statute.
collateral
review
is
a
proceeding
occurring
after
final
judgment
that
could
affect
that
judgment.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes,
for
purposes
of
the
tolling
provision.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
in
duncan,
this
court
talked
about
the
possibility
of
civil
commitment
or
contempt
custody
that
could
be
part
of
the
rule
2254
proceeding
and
that
that
would
not
be
post-conviction.
so
that
post-conviction
is
a
form
of
collateral
review,
but
is
not
the
only
form.
in
duncan
the
court
also
discussed
the
fact
that
many
states
may
call
what
other
states
call
post-conviction
review
something
else,
and
that
that
would
also
then
be
collateral.
the
collateral
is
just
a
--
an
umbrella
that
encompasses
post-conviction
and
other
forms
of
review
after
a
judgment.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
under
the
state's
theory,
there
would
not
be.
i
did
not
file
this
motion.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
may
be
in
other
respects,
your
honor,
but
not
this
one.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
from
the
state's
perspective.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
problem
with
omitting
the
word
"illegal",
because--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--yes.
it
is
a
request
for
the
court
to
--
to
review,
to
take
a
second
look,
to
reexamine
the
sentence
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
unduly
severe
at
the
time
that
it
was
imposed.
you
are
asking
the
court
to
--
to
take
a
second
look,
either
based
on
factors
that
were
either
submitted
at
sentencing
or
additional
information
that--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--you
can
raise
those
issues
under
the
post-conviction
review.
you
can
also
raise
them
--
in
rhode
island,
there
is
a
provision
of
the
post-conviction
review
statute
that
speaks
of
the
--
any
facts
that
would
require
a
new
proceeding
in
the
interests
of
justice.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
in
rhode
island
you
can
not
challenge
your
sentence
on
direct
review.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
you
challenge
it
by
way
of
the
rule
35
motion.
it's
the
normal--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--that's
the
normal
vehicle
that
is
used
for
challenging
the
sentence.
i
believe
that
you
could
also
encompass
it
in
a
motion
for
post-conviction
relief,
which
is
the
kind
of
umbrella
rhode
island
procedure
for
raising--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--under
my
understanding
of
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
decisions,
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
believe
that
that
is
the
holding
of
the
rhode
island
supreme
court.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
exhaustion
for
federal
habeas
is
limited
to
the
exhaustion
of
claims
that
are
going
to
be
presented
in
the
federal
habeas
petition.
and
since
the
denial
of
a
request
for
a
sentence
reduction
on
the
grounds
of
abuse
of
discretion
is
not
going
to
be
a
claim
that
is
cognizable
in
federal
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction,
then
you
would
not
need
to
exhaust
it.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
exhaustion
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
tolling
provision,
but
this
court
has
recognized
that
aedpa's
purpose
was
to
further
the
principles
of
comity
and
finality
and
federalism
and
had
a
clear
purpose
of
encouraging
litigants
to
pursue
claims
in
state
court
prior
to
seeking
federal
review.
so,
tying
the
tolling
provision
to
state
applications
shows
congressional
concern
for
comity,
which
at
its
core
is
a
respect
for
the
state
processes
that
are
used
in
reviewing
the
claims
of
state
prisoners.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
it
would
be
raised
in
the
state
rule
35,
a
motion
to
correct.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
it
could
be
raised
under
the
state
post-conviction
review
proceedings
as
well.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--not
on
direct
appeal.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
rule
35
is
a
collateral
proceeding.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes,
or
perhaps
in
a
motion
for
post-conviction
relief
under
section
10-9.1.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
a
prisoner
who
receives
adequate
relief
in
the
state
court,
through
whatever
vehicle,
may
choose
not
to
pursue
a
federal
habeas
corpus
claim.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
would
say
that
would
be
unlikely,
but
there
are
many
federal
habeas
cases
that
are
--
raise
questions
of,
for
example,
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
at
sentencing.
a
state
resolution
that
reduces
the
sentence
would
obviate
the
need
for
a
federal
habeas
petition
in
that
context.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
2255,
justice
ginsburg,
has
no
tolling
provision
at
all,
and
the
reason
for
that
may
perhaps
be
the
respect
for
comity
that
congress
recognized
when
you
are
addressing
a
2254
petition
filed
by
a
state
prisoner.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
don't
practice
in
rhode
island,
but
in
this
case
the
rule
35
did
not
sit.
it
was
resolved
by
the
trial
court
within
3
months.
the
issue,
the
potential
for
abuse
for
sitting
on
motions,
is
not
limited
to
a
rhode
island
rule
35.
it's
not
a
peculiar
concern.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
the
rule
35
also
provides
that
the
decision
must
be
made
within
a
reasonable
time.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no.
120
days
is
the
time
frame--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--within
which
the
motion
must
be
filed.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
the
rule
also
provides
that
it
must
be
decided
or
resolved
within
a
reasonable
time.
so
there
is
a
--
a
limitation
in
that
respect.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
have
not
found
any
rhode
island
cases
discussing
that
particular
question.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
that's
my
understanding
also.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no.
a
rule
35
motion
must
be
filed
within
120
days.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
a
defendant
would
have
an
interest
in
getting
an--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--he
could
correct
it
by
filing
the
motion
at
any
time,
and--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--in
the
trial
court.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
he
appeals.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
if
both
appeals
are
pending
at
the
same
time,
the
practice
would
be
to
consolidate
them,
so
you
would
have
a
ruling
from
the
rhode
island
supreme
court--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--then
the
judgment
would
become
final
when
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
affirms
the
conviction
and
either
this
court--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--you
may
have
two
time
frames--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--i
would
say
june.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
there
may
be
an
appeal--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--from
such
--
from
the
denial
of
a
rule
35.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
it
--
the
rule
35--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--rhode
island's
manner
of
addressing
the
rule
35
seems
to
be
somewhat
unusual
in
terms
of--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--if
the
rule
35
motion
is
filed
after
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
affirms
the
judgment
with--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--judgment
of
conviction.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
it
is,
justice
breyer.
and
i
have
not
seen
any
rhode
island
cases
addressing
a
rule
35
motion
that
was
not
filed
after
the
judgment
of
conviction
had
been
affirmed
in
the
context
of
looking
for
a
discretionary--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--in
terms
of
a
motion
for
reduction
for
leniency--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--i
have
not
seen
any
--
prejudgment
--
pre-rhode
island
supreme
court
resolution.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
that
is
what
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
has
said.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
do
not
have
that
with
me.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
this
court
has
discussed
--
has
used
the
term
"collateral
review"
in
a
number
of
different
contexts,
in
civil
cases,
in
habeas
cases,
in
the
manner
of
distinguishing
between
direct
review
and
something
that
is
outside
direct
review.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
"collateral"
generally
means
supplementary,
as
defined
in
black's,
and
"collateral
attack"
in
black's
is
defined
as
an
attack
on
a
judgment
in
a
proceeding
other
than
direct
appeal.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
but
the
rule
35
motion
in
rhode
island
is
not
part
of
the
direct
appeal.
it
is
a
separate,
specific--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--it
is
part
of
the
case,
justice
alito,
but
a
--
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
based
on
newly
discovered
evidence
which
is
viewed
as
collateral
is
also
part
of
the
original
proceeding.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
the
motions
for
new
trial
--
a
motion
for
new
trial
that
has
to
be
filed
within
10
or
14
days
of
the
conviction
would
be
part
of
the
direct
appeal
and
therefore
would
be
--
would
not
be
collateral.
but
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
that
is
filed
after
the
judgment
is
affirmed
by
a
court
of
appeals
and
the
time
for
cert
has
passed
would
be
collateral.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
was
limiting
the
use
of
the
term
"collateral
review"
to
a
post-conviction
legal
challenge.
congress
could
have
said
that
if
it
had
wished.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
traditionally
motions
that
are
filed
--
motions
for
new
trial
are
--
may
be
filed
after
the
judgment
has
been
affirmed
and
have
been
viewed
by
the
courts
as
collateral,
as
collateral
review.
so
there
is
--
the
tradition
doesn't
limit
the
use
of
the
term
collateral
review
to
a
proceeding
that
is
completely
separate
and
apart.
indeed,
a
2255,
while
it
may
be
separately
filed,
is
then
consolidated
with
the
original
proceeding
and
there's
an
entry
in
the
docket,
you
shall
not
file
any
more
pleadings
in
that
separate
case.
it
all
goes
back
to
the
original
case
of
2255,
which
is
collateral,
is
heard
by
the
trial
court.
so
there
is
a
--
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
congress
was
limiting
collateral
review
to
something
outside
of
the
original
proceeding.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no,
i
do
not,
justice
kagan.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
because
2244(d)(2)
is
tolling
an
application
for
review
with
respect
to
the
pertinent
judgment
or
claim.
and
a
--
an
application
for
clemency
doesn't
produce
any
change
in
the
judgment
that
is
rendered
by
the
court.
it's
not
a
request
that
is
related
to
the
legal
reasoning
behind
the
judgment,
doesn't
challenge
the
basis
for
the
judgment,
and
it's
an
executive
branch
function,
in
some
cases
with
advice
and
consent
of
a
legislative
body,
and
there
is
no
judicial
review.
so
it
is--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--i
would
agree.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes,
it
is,
justice
ginsberg,
as
is
a
rule
33
motion
for
a
new
trial
based
on
newly
discovered
evidence,
which
courts
have
held
to
be
collateral.
it's
a
question
of
--
of
when
these
motions
are
filed
that
makes
them
collateral.
they
are
not
part
of
the
direct
review
process.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
tolling
would
not
come
into
--
into
play
until
after
the
judgment
has
become
final.
this
has
been
addressed
in
--
it
would
have
no
impact
on
tolling.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
the
judgment
would
become
final
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
if
on
appeal,
if
there
is
an
appeal
and
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
has--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--yes.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
it
has
to
be
filed
within
121
days
after
the
entry.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
it
would
have
to
be
filed
after
the
sentence
is
imposed.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
and
the
sentence--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--i
would
say
it
becomes
final
when
it
is
imposed.
