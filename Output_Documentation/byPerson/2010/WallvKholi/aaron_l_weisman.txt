mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
a
state
court
sentence
reduction
motion,
which
is
a
pure
plea
for
leniency,
qualifies
as,
quote,
"an
application
for
post-conviction
or
other
collateral
review.
"
within
the
meaning
of
28
u.s.c.
section
2244(d)(2).
the
state
respectfully
argue
that
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
why
such
a
term
as
"collateral
review"
refers
only
to
a
legal
challenge,
refer
to
those
recognized
post-direct
appeal
applications
in
which
constitutional,
jurisdictional,
and
other
such
fundamental
errors
may
be
raised.
first,
as
this
court
has
said,
it
is
presumed
--
congress
is
presumed
to
have
known
the
language
that
this
court
used
in
its
decisions,
and
the
term
2255
applications
as
those
type
of
independent
civil
inquiries
testing
the
validity
of
a
conviction
and/or
sentence.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
well,
i
think
both
parties
are
in
agreement,
your
honor,
that
the
post-conviction
review
is
a
parcel
of
the
other
collateral
review.
that's
not--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--yes,
but
it's
--
but
with
respect,
your
honor,
it
is
"or
other
collateral
review",
and
the
"or
other"
--
and
i
think
both
parties
are
in
agreement
as
to
this
--
"or
other"
embraces
that
state
post-conviction
review
must
also
be,
quote/unquote,
"collateral
review".
also,
i
think
importantly,
it
would
be
anomalous
in
a
tolling
provision,
in
which
we
are
talking
about
a
direct
appeal
already
having
been
concluded,
to
embrace
things
that
don't
--
that
don't
--
that
come
prior
to
the
direct
appeal.
this
is
a
tolling
--
obviously,
2244(d)(1)
speaks
about
the
finality
of
a
state
court
judgment
of
conviction.
at
that
point,
obviously--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--well,
it
can
be
made
--
it
can
be
made
prior
to
when
the
conviction
becomes
final.
for
example,
it
can
be
made
within
120
days
of
the
imposition
of
sentence.
or
it
can
be
made
within
120
days
after
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
on
direct
appeal
of
the
rhode
island
supreme
court.
so
it
can
be
made
prior
to
when
the
conviction
becomes,
quote/unquote,
"final".
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
well,
i'm
not
sure
we
conceded
that
point,
your
honor.
i
think
clearly
we
are
all
in
agreement
that
post-conviction
vehicles
and
habeas
vehicles,
which
obviously
all
traditionally
occur
after
the
direct
appeal
has
been
concluded,
obviously
qualify
as
what
this
court's
--
and
everybody,
we
would
suggest
--
recognize
as,
quote/unquote,
"collateral
review".
in
terms
of
a
rule
35
motion
that
says,
for
example,
the
sentence
is
outside
of
the
--
outside
of
the
proper
boundaries,
it's
unlawful
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
don't
think
we've
actually
conceded
before
this
court
that
that
would
qualify.
but
certainly
this--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--not--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--correct.
our
rule
35
contains
within
the
same
provision
a
challenge
to
the
legality
of
the
sentence,
to
the
manner
in
which
it
was
imposed--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--a
pure
legal
challenge,
correct.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
we
would
suggest
that
this
court
doesn't
have
to
answer
that
question
here.
there
are
good
arguments
why
it
would
not,
again
because
in
a
tolling
provision
that
speaks
about
collateral
review
--
and
again,
2255--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--well,
certainly
when
all
you're
doing,
as
the
first
circuit
recognized,
is
making
a
pure
plea
for
leniency,
sentence
leniency,
you're
not--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--well,
it
could
be
argued--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--well,
it
could
be
argued
that
we
are
talking
about
vehicles
that
challenge
the
validity
of
a
judgment
that
has
already
survived
scrutiny
under
direct
review.
and
a
rule
35
vehicle,
even
one
that
raises
a
legal
challenge,
a
tolling
provision
simply
would
not
begin
to
run
at
that
point.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
well,
we
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
collateral
review
as
explained
by
this
court
is
referring
to
the
difference
between
collateral
review
and
direct
review.
and
the
case
in--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--this
is
not
--
this
is
clearly
not
--
this
is
not
in
the
direct
review
process.
no,
it's
not.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
this
court,
though,
your
honor,
has
said
that,
speaking
about
when
congress
enacted
2255,
it
simplified
the
procedure
for
making
a
collateral
attack
on
a
final
judgment
entered
in
a
federal
criminal
case,
but
it
did
not
purport
to
modify
the
distinction,
again,
between
collateral
review
and
direct
review.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
well,
we
go
forward
and
use
that
--
even
--
we
would
suggest,
your
honor,
even
more
strongly
that
the
phrase
"collateral
review",
as
that
phrase
has
been
used
by
this
court
consistently,
recognizes
that
this
is
a
procedure
that
occurs
after
the
completion
of
a
direct
review
process.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
but,
your
honor,
respectfully,
in
state
v.
addonizio
itself,
it
contrasted
the
rule
35
motion,
for
example.
many
jurisdictions,
including
obviously
the
federal
courts,
had
this
very
--
almost
exact
rule
35-type
proceeding.
it's
never
been
referred
to,
it
has
never
been
understood
in
thousands
of
cases,
as
collateral
review.
it's
always
been
understood
as
sort
of
a
quasi-civil
inquiry,
after
the--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--we
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
we
don't
believe
it
ever
referred
to
a
sentence,
a
plea
for
sentence
leniency,
your
honor,
no,
not
as
a
plea,
a
pure
plea
for
leniency
under
rule
35.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
yes.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
that's
correct
--
correct,
your
honor.
we
are
just
speaking
about
the
pre-1987
guidelines
rule,
which
is--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--i
think,
your
honor,
we
have
to
differentiate
between
a
legal
ground
and
the
vehicle.
again,
the
vehicle,
the
reduction,
the
plea
for
leniency
vehicle,
is
not
a
legal
vehicle.
it's
simply,
i
think,
as
kholi
kind
of
recognized--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--but
what
it--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--well,
to
the
extent
it's
abuse
of
discretion,
it's
really
shorthand
for
the
appellate
court
takes
a
look
if
the
sentence
is
within
the
proper
bounds
and
if
there
was,
quote,
"some
justification"
for
the
imposition
of
the
sentence,
then
it's
affirmed.
and
just
like
on
the--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--if
there
is
no
justification
--
i
can
say
it
hasn't
happened
so
far
in
our
state,
and
i
think
--
i
don't
know
what
happens
in
other
states.
but
essentially,
that's
all
the
inquiry
is.
if
it's
within
the
legal
bounds,
the
filing
of
the
motion
itself,
as
to
pre-'87
guidelines,
presumes
the
validity
of
the
conviction
and
sentence
and
it
simply
says:
give
me
a
second
chance;
take
a
second
look;
look
at
the
offender,
look
at
the
characteristics,
look
at--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--they
could
be
the
same.
they
could
be
other.
there
is
a
wide--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--correct.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
it's
not
much
different
at
all,
your
honor.
it's
essentially
the
same.
it
is
simply--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--because
we
don't
believe
they
are
legal
matters,
your
honor.
what
they
are
asking
for
is
sentence
leniency
based
on,
sure,
factual
matters
like,
as
you
indicated,
your
honor,
chief
justice,
the
history
of
the
individual,
the
various--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
we
have
a
procedure
whereby
generally
sentence
reduction
and
sentencing
issues
must
be
raised
pursuant
to
rule
35.
if
i
could--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--no.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
correct,
correct.
what
the--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--yes.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
well,
what
we
suggest
is
the
abuse
of
discretion
that
that
is
talking
about
is
if
there
is
no
justification.
again,
they
look
at
the
sentence
and
if
there
is
no
justification
for
it
then
it
will
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
if
there
is
some
justification
--
and
again,
it
hasn't
happened.
if
there
is
some
--
if
the
sentence
is
within
the
legal
limits
and
there
is
some
justification
for
it,
it
will
be
affirmed.
that's
the
shorthand.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
we
have
not.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
no.
what
we
are
saying,
your
honor,
is
if
there
is
some
justification
for
it
and
if
it's
within
the
legal
sentencing
bounds,
the
denial
of
the
rule
35
motion
is
affirmed.
and
that
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
because
the
inquiry
is
simply
--
i
understand
the
words
"abuse
of
discretion"
are
used,
but
the
"no
justification
and
manifestly
excessive
standard.
"
simply,
as
the
cases
explicate,
looks
at
the
sentence;
if
it's
legal
and
if
there
is
some
justification
for
it,
the
appeal
is
denied.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
i
understand.
but
certainly,
your
honor,
just
using
the
formulation
that
everything
that
is
filed
in
a
state
court
post
a
judgment
of
conviction
qualifies
would
certainly
be
an
odd
way
for
that
congress
to
expect.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
yes.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
yes,
certainly,
your
honor:
"the
court
may
correct
in
a
legal
sentence
at
any
time.
"
period.
"the
court
may
correct
a
sentence
imposed
in
an
illegal
manner
and
it
may
reduce
any
sentence
when
a
motion
is
filed
within
120
days
after
sentence
is
imposed
or
within
120
days
after
receipt
by
the
court
of
a
mandate.
"
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
we're
talking
--
this
case
involves
only
a
motion
to
reduce
sentence.
and
certainly
the
policy
considerations
for
what
congress
would
have
intended--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--it
might.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
it
might,
your
honor.
and
under
our
system
it
might
--
that
might
have
been
characterized,
not
as
a
sentence
reduction
provision
or
sentence
reduction
vehicle,
but
as
a
legal
motion
to
correct
an
illegal
sentence,
or
challenging
the
sentence.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
sure.
if
i
could
just
address
that,
your
honor.
the
problem
is
that
simply
because
a
statute
of
limitations
is
an
affirmative
defense,
these
are
matter
that
already
are
going
to
have
been
included
in
the
state
court.
before
anyone
files
for
2254,
the
state
court's
going
to
have
findings.
this
is
either
going
to
be
a
motion
for
sentence
leniency
or
it's
going
to
be
a
motion
to
correct
an
illegal
sentence.
these
matters
are
going
to
have
to
be
pled
by
the
state
as
well.
so
when
an
applicant
goes
to
federal
court,
district
court,
and
files
a
2254,
if
we
want
to
raise
the
affirmative
defense
of
the
time
bar,
which
will
save
the
federal
court
a
lot
of
time,
obviously,
because
there
is
no
case
at
all
--
and
if
we
can
contrast
it
with
exhaustion,
for
example,
which
as
this
court
obviously
is
familiar
with,
presents
very
complicated
questions
of
whether,
you
know,
state
procedures
were
exhausted
and
claims
were
exhausted,
this
is
very
straightforward.
if
somebody
raises
a
motion
which
challenges
the
legality
of
the
sentence,
it
will
be
characterized
in
state
court
in
the
run
of
the
mine
--
in
the
run
of
the
mine
cases,
as
an
illegal
sentence.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
right.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
well--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--well,
what
we
suggest
actually
is
very
straightforward,
your
honor.
if
somebody
captions
their
document
"motion
for
sentence"
--
"for
sentence
reduction
and
motion
to
correct
an
illegal
sentence.
"
that's
not
this
case,
obviously,
because
then--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--well,
it's
may
not
so
much
be
the
magic
words,
but
it's
what
the
--
as
this
court
has
said,
it's
what
the
substance
of
the
motion
seeks,
and
that
will
already
have
been
determined
in
state
court.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
because--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--because,
your
honor,
they
actually
want
to
reduce
their
sentence.
it's
not
--
we
don't
suggest
--
it's
not
a
matter
of
playing
games.
they
feel
they
were
sentenced
for
30
years
and
maybe
they
want
20
years,
and
if
they
want
to
challenge
the
legality
of
the
sentence,
they
recognize
the
established
collateral
attack
vehicles.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
well,
we
have
spoken
about
the
words
"collateral
review"
as
embracing
a
case
that's
already
--
upon
looking
at
a
proceeding
that
occurs
after
the
finality
of
the
judgment,
which
obviously
includes
this
court's
denial
of
cert
or
the
time--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--no.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
it
can.
it
certainly
can,
your
honor.
and
we
would
suggest--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--no.
we
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
that
furthers
our
argument.
a
rule
35
motion
is
not
collateral
review
because
it
is
not
a
motion
--
you
could
say
even
in
the
legal
sense,
motion.
it's
not
a
motion
that
occurs
after
the
judgment
becomes
final.
and
we
are
looking
at
a
tolling
provision,
and
the
congressional
intent
of
the
tolling
provision
was
finality
and
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
they
have
120
days.
it
can
be
filed
after
the
sentence
is
imposed,
120
days
of
that
date,
or
120
days
after
the
conviction
becomes
final.
we
would
suggest
that
the
term
"collateral
review"
embraces,
as
justice
alito
indicated,
sort
of
that
concept
that
obviously
in
a
tolling
provision
it
begins
to
run
when
the
conviction
becomes
final.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
it's
clearly
not,
your
honor,
correct.
i
think
as
everybody
recognizes,
the
kholi
panel
and
the
respondents
in
this
case
as
well
characterized
this
rule
35
proceeding
as
sort
of
apart,
distinct,
away
from
the
underlying
case.
and
that's
undoubtedly
true
in
the
sense
that
it's
not
--
it's
not
part
of
the
direct
review
process.
it's
--
it's
clearly
not.
but
that
doesn't
mean
it's
collateral
review.
it's
not
either/or.
it
can
be--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--it
--
it's
neither
fish
nor
fowl,
your
honor.
i
mean,
simply
because
it's
not
part
of
the
direct
review
process
doesn't
mean
that
it's
quote,
"collateral
review",
because
again
"collateral
review"
has
the
sort
of
meaning
in
the
law,
using
this
court's
decisions,
using
this
court's
cases,
referring
to
a
post-judgment
vehicle
in
which
fundamental
jurisdictional
and
other
types
of
errors
can
be
raised.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
well,
i
don't
know
that
it
needs
to
be
called
anything,
your
honor.
i
think
the
only
question
with
respect--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--well--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--it
is
certainly
--
it
is
certainly
an
interesting
vehicle
because,
it
can
be
filed
prior
to
the
finality
of
the
judgment
and
it
can
be
filed
--
and
it
can
be
filed
after
the
judgment
becomes
final.
and
again,
going
--
going
back
to
the
policies,
the
2244(d)(2),
very
clearly,
two
big
policies
again
are
finality,
which
it
obviously
promotes
--
these
cases
would
not
be
in
federal
court
if
they
were
time-barred
--
and
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
to
have
a
motion
that
seeks
leniency
only,
there
is
no
purpose
that
could
be
accomplished
by
bringing
that
motion
into
federal
court
and
therefore
it
doesn't
serve
that
purpose.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
we
are
not.
but
--
but
the
important
element
there,
your
honor,
is
that
those
vehicles
can
be
raised
to
bring
--
those
are
the
vehicles,
the
collateral
vehicles,
through
which
the
states
have
channelled
constitutional,
jurisdictional
and
other
fundamental
claims.
the
rule
35
sentence
reduction
vehicle
doesn't
--
can't
do
it,
can't
do
that
service.
so
sure,
you
could
have
--
you
could
have
a
habeas,
and
the
only
issue,
the
only
claim
raised
in
the
habeas
could
be,
you
know,
it
is
in
violation
of
--
of
my
state
rights,
which
couldn't
be
heard
in
2254,
but--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--exactly.
but
congress
may
have
well
said,
we
are
not
going
to
be
in
the
business
of
looking
at
the
individual
claims.
look,
this
is
a
collateral
review
vehicle.
this
vehicle
is
a
recognized
vehicle
for
bringing,
for
channelling
in
these
claims.
so
that's
going
to
toll.
but
this
other
vehicle,
this
rule
35
sentence
reduction
vehicle,
it
can
never
be
used
for
a
claim
that
could
go
to
federal
court.
it's
pointless.
i
mean,
it
wouldn't
serve
the
purpose,
and
of
course
it
would
undermine
the
state's
interest
in
getting
the
state
prisoners
into
federal
court
within
1
year.
i
will
rest
with
my
time
if
that's
okay,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
again,
if
i
could
just
clarify
regarding
the
scope
of
rule
35.
the
reporter's
notes
on
rule
35
do
make
it
clear
that
an
illegal
sentence
is
one
which
has
been
imposed
after
a
valid
conviction
but
is
not
authorized
under
law.
it
includes,
e.g.,
a
sentence
in
excess
of
that
provided
by
statute,
imposition
of
an
unauthorized
form
of
punishment,
a
judgment
that
does
not
conform
to
the
oral
sentence;
and
our
supreme
court
has
gone
on
to
explain
this
provision
by
saying,
we
have
never
--
we
have
never
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
a
penal
statute
in
the
context
of
a
rule
35
motion,
nor
do
we
declare
that
a
sentence
imposed
pursuant
to
an
unconstitutional
statute
is
illegally
as
contemplated
by
rule
35.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
i'm
sorry,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
although
there
is
dicta
and
some
language
where
our
supreme
court
says
essentially
file
challenges
to
your
sentence
as
pursuant
to
rule
35,
it
is
clear
that
only
certain
types
of
challenges
can
be
brought
in
a
rule
35
motion.
in
the
run
of
the
mill
cases,
they
have
to
be
brought
if
there
is
an
appellate
record
in
direct
appeal,
or
most
commonly
they
are
brought
pursuant
to
the
state's
post-conviction
relief.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
right.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
the
only
ones
that
are
correct
on
a
rule
35(a)
are
again
where
the
sentence
is
not
authorized
by
law,
when
where
it
has
imposed
unauthorized
form
of
punishment,
or
a
judgment--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--correct.
correct.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
correct.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
well
--
correct.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
that
is
correct.
correct.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
right.
and
our--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--and
our
position
would
be,
that's
not
part
of
the
direct
review
appellate
process.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
that's--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--but
your
honor,
that
could
occur
at
any
time.
that
can
occur
5
or
10
years
or
20
years
later.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
and
we're
not--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--but
we
would
suggest--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--yes,
but
our
point
would
be,
your
honor,
that
it
doesn't
move
the
start
of
the
1-year
limitations
period.
the
start
of
the
1-year
limitations
period
as
this
court
said
in
jiminez
v.
quarterman
begins
when
it
begins.
it
begins
when
that
judgment
becomes
final,
which
is
90
days
after
our
supreme
court
affirms
the
judgment
of
conviction--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--it
doesn't--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--no.
what
we
--
respectfully,
what
i
will
going
to
say
is
collateral
review
refers
to
those,
as
this
court
said
in
duncan
v.
walker,
habeas
post-conviction
relief
vehicles
that
--
that
occur
after
the
conviction
has
become
final.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
it
becomes
final--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--well,
under
jiminez
v.
walker
becomes
final
when
--
90
days
from
when
the
supreme
court
affirms
the
conviction.
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
because
congress
has
decided
to
pick
the
day
on
which
the
appeal
becomes
--
the
conviction
becomes
final,
which
always
occurs
90
days
after
the
state's
high
court--
mr.
aaron
l.
weisman
--yes,
but
congress
has
set
four
dates
on
which
the
conviction
becomes
final.
