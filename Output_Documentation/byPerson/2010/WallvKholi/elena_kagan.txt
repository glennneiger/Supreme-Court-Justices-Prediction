but
isn't
that
true
regardless
of
whether
the
rule
35
motion
seeks
legal
relief
or
discretionary
relief
alone,
that
both
can
be
made
prior
to
the
finality
of
the
judgment?
justice
elena
kagan
and
--
and
if
i
understand
your
argument,
your
argument
is
that
rule
35
motions
that
seek
legal
review
do
fall
within
the
2244(d)(2)
language.
it's
just
that
rule
35
motions
that
seek
discretionary
relief
do
not.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
weisman,
i
think
that
that's
not
right,
that
the
--
as
you
say,
that
the
rule
35
motion
that
rhode
island
has
is
based
on
the
federal
rule
35
motion
that
existed
prior
to
1987,
and
that
on
a
couple
of
occasions
this
court
talked
about
that
prior
federal
rule
35
as
collateral
review.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
elena
kagan
u.s.
v.
robinson,
barton
v.
united
states.
i
might
be
wrong
about
it.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
weisman,
i'm
sorry.
before
you
talk
about
policy,
so
this
motion
to
reduce
sentence
is
very
short.
it
just
says
that
the
man
"prays
that
the
sentence
imposed
with
respect
to
the
above
matter
be
reduced
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
rule
35.
"
would
it
make
a
difference
to
you
if
it
said
he
prays
that
the
sentence
imposed
--
he
"prays
that
the
illegal
sentence
imposed
with
respect
to
the
above
matter
be
reduced
in
accordance
with
provisions
of
rule
35?
"
justice
elena
kagan
if
he
had
put
in
that
word
"illegal",
would
that
have
made
the
difference?
justice
elena
kagan
so
but
that
does
suggest
the
difficulty
that
justice
scalia
raises,
is
that
we
are
going
to
have
to
look
at
the
particular
rule
of
the
state,
we
are
going
to
have
to
look
at
the
particular
motion,
we
are
going
to
look
at
any
--
we're
going
to
have
to
look
at
any
state
law
regarding
how
motions
are
construed.
and
this
is
going
to
be
a
very
difficult
determination.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
weisman,
that's
true
also
of
state
habeas
claims
that
are
based
only
on
state
law.
but
six
circuits
have
said
that
2244(d)(2)
applies
to
those
claims.
are
you
contesting
that?
justice
elena
kagan
where
the
exhaustion
policy
does
not
come
into
effect.
justice
elena
kagan
i
think,
ms.
mizner,
the
amicus
brief
in
this
case
asserted
that
in
rhode
island
or
in
other
states
with
a
rule
like
this
many
judges
sit
on
these
rule
35
motions.
they
just
let
them
stay
pending
for
a
considerable
period
of
time,
in
order
to
retain
some
ability
to
modify
the
sentence
if
and
when
they
feel
like
doing
so.
is
that
your
understanding
of
what
happens
to
these
motions,
that
they
just
sit,
that
they
are
not
denied?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you--
justice
elena
kagan
--do
you
think
that
a
petition
for
clemency
that
is
presented
to
the
governor
would
toll
the
limitations
period?
justice
elena
kagan
why
--
why
is
that
different?
