justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
we
adopt
your
formulation
generally,
that
it
has
to
be
for
legal
error,
collateral
review
has
to
be
for
legal
error,
and
we
can
even
add
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
found,
that
it
has
to
be
by
a
court
in
order
to
avoid
clemency
parole
review
boards,
and
so
forth.
i
don't
see
why
you
don't
lose
anyway,
because
the
allegation
here,
the
complaint,
the
argument,
may
be
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
and
if
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
that
is
a
legal
ground
to
set
aside
the
sentence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
motion
made
in
a
court,
reviewable
by
the
appellate
courts
of
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
little
odd
to
say
it's
not
legal.
if
--
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
is
something
we're
quite
familiar
with
in
the
law.
we've
never
thought
of
that
as
being
somehow
extra-legal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
after
a
conviction
in
the
state,
if
there's
an
appeal
with
a
number
--
on
direct
review,
with
a
number
of
issues,
improperly
admitted
evidence
and
so
forth,
you
--
the
lawyer
can't
add
--
and
in
addition
he
was
sentenced
under
the
wrong
provision.
he
was
given
5
years
too
many
because
the
judge
cited
the
wrong
provision.
you
can't
say
that
on
direct
review.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
citation
for
that,
that
you
have?
