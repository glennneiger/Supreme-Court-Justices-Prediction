justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
is
another
argument
that
you
could
make
other
than
the
one
you
have
been
pressing,
which
is
that
collateral
review
means
something
other
than
a
step
in
the
criminal
case.
but
you
have
chosen
not
to
make
that;
is
that
correct.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
am
i
correct
that
you
think
"post-conviction
or
other
collateral
review"
means
anything
that
occurs
after
the
conclusion
of
direct
review?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
what
does
the
phrase
"or
other
collateral
review"
add?
why
--
why
wouldn't
congress
just
say
"post-conviction
review"?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
return
to
the
question
justice
ginsburg
asked
a
couple
minutes
ago?
let's
say
we
have
a
case
in
which
a
defendant
convicted
in
state
court
has
some
exhausted
federal
claims
that
this
defendant
wants
to
raise
in
a
federal
habeas;
also
files
a
motion
seeking
a
reduction
of
sentence
based
purely
on
a
request
for
leniency,
sentence
within
the
range
prescribed
by
the
statute.
what
purpose
is
served
by
tolling
the
time
to
file
the
federal
habeas
during
the
pendency
of
this
request
for
leniency
in
the
state
court?
you
say
comity,
but
in
concrete
practical
terms
what
purpose
is
served?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
your
experience,
does
that
happen
a
lot?
you
have
somebody
who
is
sentenced
to
a
5-year
sentence
and
that's
within
the
range,
also
has
legal
challenges
that
would
result
in
no
conviction,
no
time
whatsoever
and
no
criminal
conviction,
that
person
decides
to
give
up
on
the
legal
challenge
because
the
5-year
sentence
might
be
reduced
to
3
or
2
or
1?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
happen
if
the
statutory
maximum
for
an
offense
in
rhode
island
is
5
years
and
the
sentencing
judge
imposes
a
sentence
of
10
years,
and
the
defense
attorney
at
that
time
says,
well,
you
can't
do
that;
that's
more
than
a
statutory
maximum,
and
the
judge
goes
ahead
with
it
and
then
an
appeal
is
taken?
are
you
saying
that
the
appellate
court
in
rhode
island
would
not
entertain
that
argument?
they
would
say
you
have
to
go
back
and
make
a
rule
35
motion
in
the
trial
court?
i
mean,
that's
the
procedure.
that
seems
odd.
is
that
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
return
you
to
something
more
basic?
do
you
think
the
term
"collateral
review"
is
a
legal
term
of
art,
or
is
it
a
term
that
we
can
--
we
should
interpret
simply
by
looking
up
the
word
"collateral"
in
a
dictionary?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
--
if
i
look
up
"collateral
attack"
in
black's
law
dictionary,
won't
i
find
a
definition
there?
won't
it
tell
me
that
this
is
something
other
than
the
proceeding?
this
is
an
attack
on
a
judgment
outside
of
the
proceeding
that
led
to
the
entry
of
that
judgment.
isn't
that
what
the
term
generally
means?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
is
part
of
the
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
just
a
regular
motion
for
a
new
trial,
not
based
on
newly
--
on
newly
discovered
evidence?
is
that
collateral,
or
is
that
part
of
the
criminal
proceeding?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
wrong
with
the
argument
that
nothing
that
occurs
in
the
criminal
case
itself
is
collateral?
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
spoke
about
collateral
review
was
something
like
habeas.
let
me
give
you
an
alternative
interpretation
of
this,
and
maybe
it's
completely
wrong,
but
you
will
tell
me
why
it's
wrong.
post-conviction
is
a
term
of
art.
many
states,
including
rhode
island,
have
post-conviction
review
statutes.
so
congress
wanted
to
have
that
time,
the
time
when
those
proceedings
were
tolled
--
were
pending,
were
tolled
--
but
not
every
state
uses
that
phrase.
not
every
state
uses
that
term.
they
have
other
names
for
the
proceeding,
and
that's
what's
meant
by
"other
collateral
review".
collateral
review
is
a
term
of
art.
it's
not
something
that
you
understand
by
looking
up
the
word
"collateral"
in
a
dictionary.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
not
saying
it
has
to
do
with
whether
it's
legal
or
something
else.
it
has
to
do
with
whether
it's
in
the
criminal
case
or
not
in
the
criminal
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
2255
is
--
is
in
the
original
case
but
it's
a
habeas
substitute.
it
was
adopted
by
congress
as
a
substitute
for
habeas,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
concerns
the
1-year
limitation
provision
for
filing
a
federal
habeas
petition
under
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996.
the
statute
provides
that
that
one-year
period
is
tolled
by
“a
properly
filed
application
for
a
state
post-conviction
or
other
collateral
review
with
respect
to
the
pertinent
judgment
or
claim.”
and
the
question
here
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
"other
collateral
review."
specifically,
the
question
here
is
whether
a
motion
to
reduce
sentence
under
rhode
island
law
is
an
application
for
“collateral
review”
that
tolls
the
limitation
period.
for
the
reason
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
phrase
"collateral
review"
in
this
provision
means
judicial
review
of
a
judgment
in
a
proceeding
that
is
not
part
of
the
direct
review
process.
the
parties
here
agree
that
rhode
island's
motion
to
reduce
sentence
is
not
part
of
the
direct
review
process,
so
we
hold
that
it
is
an
application
for
a
collateral
review
that
tolls
the
limitation
period.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part.
