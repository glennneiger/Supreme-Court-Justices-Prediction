justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
rule
35
permit
a
challenge
for
a
federal
violation?
you
have
given
an
example
of
an
illegal
sentence
that
you
think
is
discretionary;
am
i
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
does
rule
35(a)
permit
a
legal
challenge
of
the
kind
that
justice
kagan
was
asking?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
let's
assume
a
pure
legal
challenge.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
rule
35(a)
be
other
collateral
relief,
as
designated
by
the
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
explain
again
why
you
don't
think
this
is
collateral?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
why
is
rule
35,
assuming
it's
a
challenge
to
an
illegal
sentence
on
a
legal
ground--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--why
would
it
not
be
collateral
review?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
if
there
is
no
justification,
what
do
they
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
quarrel
with
a
statement
in
mallacone,
a
rhode
island
2000
decision
that
says:
"we
will
interfere
with
the
trial
court's
discretion
vis
a
vis
sentencing
only
in
rare
instances
where
the
trial
justice
has
imposed
a
sentence
that
is
without
justification
and
is
grossly
disparate
from
the
other
sentences
generally
imposed
for
similar
offenses?
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
the
review
standard?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
is
the
standard
of
review.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
please
explain
to
me
why
that
is
not
what
justice
kennedy
described
as
a
review
for
abuse
of
discretion
and
why
a
review
for
abuse
of
discretion
is
not
a
legal
challenge?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
am
i
misunderstanding?
are
you
saying
that
the
rhode
island
appellate
courts
never
change
a
sentence
under
rule
35?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
are
you
saying
that
they
do
find
some
lack
of
justification?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
a
petitioner
in
the
future
in
rhode
island
should
file
a
petition
that
says:
i'm
filing
a
motion
pursuant
to
35(a)
for
an
illegal
sentence,
make
something
up?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
for
leniency.
and
then
are
district
courts
supposed
to
figure
out
whether
the
legal
challenge
was
frivolous
or
not
or
had
a
basis
in
law
or
fact--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
then
decide
whether
they
would
toll
or
not
toll
based
on
that
now
side
trial
on
what's
an
illegal
sentence
and
what's
just
a
plea
for
leniency?
that's
what
you
are
proposing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
if
they
say
"correct
the
illegal
sentence
because
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion?
"
so
is
the
magic
words
"illegal
sentence"
or
is
the
magic
words
"abuse"
--
what
are
the
magic
words?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that.
there
is
nothing
in
this
rule
that
bars
a
litigant
from
filing
after
the
conviction
is
final.
they
have
120
days.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
your
adversary
said
the
contrary,
and
i
was
--
you
are
flip-flopping.
can
this
be
brought
on
a
direct
appeal
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
an
illegal
sentence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
did
you
mean
when
you
answered
the
chief
justice
that
it
could
be
brought
in
collateral
proceedings?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
--
just
so
your
adversary,
when
he
gets
up
on
rebuttal
can
confirm
or
not
this
point,
any
challenge
to
an
illegal
sentence
has
to
be
brought
first
with
a
rule
35(a)
a
motion,
regardless
of
what
the
grounds
of
illegality
are?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
seems
to
be
some
confusion.
judgment
is
rendered
before
this
motion
is
made.
there
is
a
conviction
and
there
is
a
sentence,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
is
a
judgment
rendered.
that's
different
from
whether
the
judgment
is
final
in
a
federal
sense.
it's
final
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
because
the
judgment
was
rendered,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
if
there
is
no
appeal,
it
was
final
the
day
it
was
rendered.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned.
if
there
is
an
appeal,
then
it
may
undo
that,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
is
a
judgment
and
this
is
always
post-judgment.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
i
--
you
were
speaking
so
fast,
i
didn't
follow
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
perhaps
we
can
go
back
to
the
simple
question,
which
is,
can
a
defendant
who
has
been
sentenced
bring
a
challenge
to
a
sentence
in
a
direct
appeal,
or
not?
or
do
they
have
to
go
by
rule
35(a)?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
so
now
we
get
to
the
point
where
some
can
go
under
35(a)
but
some
can't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
they
should
go
on
direct
appeal,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
totally
confused.
if
this
is
part
of
the
criminal
proceeding,
which
is
your
position,
that
it's
not
collateral,
but
it's
part
of
the
proceedings,
when
does
this
proceeding
become
final?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
--
that
truly
--
because
--
you're--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
if
the
rhode
island
court
has
told
litigants
that
they
can't
challenge
some
portions
of
an
illegal
sentence
except
by
way
of
rule
35,
how
can
we
call
the
decision
on
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
a
final
determination
of
legality
of
the
sentence?
that's
contradictory.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
not
what
it
says.
it
talks
about
a
judgment.
and
a
judgment
in
other
terms
is
usually
the
conviction
and
the
sentence.
rhode
island
for
its
own
reasons
has
separated
the
two.
