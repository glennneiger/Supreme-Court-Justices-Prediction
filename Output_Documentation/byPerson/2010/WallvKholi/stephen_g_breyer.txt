justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
explain--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
you
go
back
for
a
second?
imagine
that
the
defendant
is
convicted
of
robbery
and
he's
sentenced
to
ten
years.
he
thinks
there
is
an
error
in
my
conviction
of
a
legal
nature
and
he
thinks
there
is
another
error
in
my
sentence
of
a
legal
nature.
now,
i
take
it
in
rhode
island
he
files
an
appeal
to
consider
the
first?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
as
to
the
second,
he
files
a
rule
35
motion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
when
does
he
file
the
rule
35
motion,
because
it
says
at
any
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
a
court
may
correct
an
illegal
sentence
at
any
time.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
mercy.
i
want
to
know
how
it
works.
he
says
there
is
a
legal
error
in
my
sentence.
when
--
how
does
he
get
that
corrected?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
take
what
i
have
as
my
view.
i
just
want
the
fact.
i'm
asking
you
a
fact.
how
and
when
does
the
person
correct
the
legal
error
in
his
sentence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
trial
court
says
no,
what
does
he
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
okay.
so
now
we
have
two
appeals.
one
is
from
the
judgment
of
conviction;
another
is
from
the
judgment
imposing
the
sentence.
now,
the
federal
statute
says
a
one-year
period
of
limitation
shall
apply
from
the
date
on
which
the
judgment
became
final.
correct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
when
is
the
date
on
which
the
judgment
of
the
sentence
became
final?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
they
are
not
--
they
are
not
--
if
they
are
not
at
the
same
time,
then
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not
the
sentence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
april
they
affirm
the
conviction.
in
june
they
affirm
the
sentence.
do
those
two
months
--
is
the
date
on
which
the
judgment
became
final
by
conclusion
of
direct
review,
does
that
run
from
april
or
from
june?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
june.
okay.
now
suppose
he
doesn't.
suppose
that
there
were
no
appeals
from
the
--
i
see.
our
problem
is
that
there
is
no
appeal
from
the
judgment
--
from
the
sentence
where
he
asks
for
correction
as
a
matter
of
mercy
and
not
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
may
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is
why,
if
you
are
willing
to
call
for
purposes
of
one
--
the
one-year
statute
begins
to
run
from
the
time
the
direct
appeal
becomes
final.
why
is
it
a
direct
appeal
of
a
sentence
where
you
appeal
the
matter
of
law
and
it
isn't
a
direct
appeal
of
a
sentence
where
you
ask
for
mercy?
it's
the
same
rule.
it's
the
same
procedure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
would
help
you
just
as
much,
i
imagine.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
it
straight
in
my
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see,
my
basic
question
is:
why
--
look.
two
appeals,
one
judgment,
one
sentence.
okay?
january,
june.
you
are
prepared
to
say
the
one-year
statute
does
not
begin
to
run
until
june.
fine.
the
rule
35
motion,
when
you
took
an
appeal,
became
final
for
purposes
of
a
federal
habeas
statute
in
june.
so
why
doesn't
the
rule
35
motion
become
final
under
(1)(a)
of
the
habeas
statute,
whenever
that
is
decided,
finally?
why
is
it
collateral
at
all?
why
isn't
it
direct,
just
as
your
first
one
was
direct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait
a
minute.
judgment
of
what?
judgment
of
conviction
or
judgment
of
sentence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
same
reason
that
it
doesn't
become
final
when
you
have
not
appealed
your
sentence
yet,
or
when
they
haven't
--
they
didn't
consolidate.
i
am
quite
confused,
as
you
see,
as
to
how
this
all
works
in
rhode
island.
rhode
island
--
i
used
to
be
on
the
first
circuit.
i
know
it
has
some
special
ways
of
doing
things.
they
are
sometimes
different,
and
this
is
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
must
be
in
rhode
island
some
complaints
about
the
sentence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
both.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
called
"it's
illegal".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
now
it's
illegal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
odd
thing
is
that
--
that
kind
of
appeal
takes
place
either
days
or
possibly
weeks
after
the
defendant
may
already
have
appealed
his
conviction
to
the
higher
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
that
normally
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
i'm
curious
about
is
what
happens
if
the
court
affirms
that
sentence,
let's
say
two
months
after
it
already
affirmed
the
conviction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
the
judgment
pursuant
to
which
--
which
is
the
judgment
that
became
final
by
conclusion
of
direct
review?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
person
is
not
being
held
in
custody
pursuant
to
a
judgment
of
the
state
court,
or
at
least
a
relevant
judgment,
until
the
sentence
has
been
appealed.
then
there
is
the
conclusion
of
direct
review
in
respect
to
the
judgment
in
respect
to
which
he
is
being
held
in
custody.
i'm
just
reading
the
statute,
the
federal
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
don't
--
that's
why
i
am
confused.
i
look
at
the
language
of
the
federal
statute
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
individual
is
not
being
held
in
custody
pursuant
to
a
judgment
until
that
sentence
is
final.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
sentence
is
final
in
the
lower
court,
but
they
say
when
the
sentence
is
final
at
the
conclusion
of
direct
review
in
respect
to
that
sentence,
which
hasn't
even
taken
place
yet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
you
are
going
to
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
appeals
in
rhode
island
from
sentences
--
all
appeals
on
their
lawfulness
or
their
mercy
take
place
under
rule
35,
and
all
of
them
are
collateral.
