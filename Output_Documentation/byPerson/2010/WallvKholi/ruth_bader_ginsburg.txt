but
mr.
weisman,
the
phrase
is
"post-conviction
or
other"
--
"or
other
collateral
review".
and
certainly
the
rule
25
--
35
motion
is
post-conviction.
so
it's
post-conviction.
it's
not
direct
review.
why
isn't
that
responsive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
"or"
usually
means
it's
something
in
addition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
go
back
to
the
--
this
is
--
you
said
prior
to.
i
thought
the
rule
35
motion
is
made
after
the
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
current
federal
rule
provides
for--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
rule
35
also,
but
it
doesn't
have
the
pure
leniency?
that's
rhode
island?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
read
the
relevant
provision
of
the
rule
35?
there
are
two
categories,
the
ones
about
legal
challenges,
at
least
as
i
read
the
rule,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--read
the
relevant
part
of
rule
35.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
are
talking
about
reducing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
scalia's
suggestion--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
perhaps
the
--
the
leniency
review
is
--
is
not
review
of
the
conviction
or
sentence.
but
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
do
anything
with
that.
you
didn't
argue
that
the
kind
of
review
that's
involved
with
leniency
is
really
not
review
of
the
sentence
for
legal
error.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
--
is
it
something
in
between?
it's
not
direct
and
it's
not
collateral?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
can
challenge
only
the
conviction,
not
the
sentence,
on
direct
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
that
rule
35
is
not
something
that
the
prisoner
must
exhaust
before
seeking
federal
habeas?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
the
whole
purpose
of
allowing
tolling
of
the
1-year
federal
statute
the
purpose
to
give
the
petitioner
an
opportunity
to
exhaust
what
he
must
exhaust?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
look
at
2255
--
that's
the
federal
post-conviction
review,
and
it
also
has
a
1-year
statute
of
limitations.
that
limitation
would
not
be
tolled
for
federal
rule
35
motion,
so
why
should
it
be
tolled
for
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
think
it
doesn't
matter
that
--
i
mean,
rule
35
motion
is
a
motion
made
in
the
original
criminal
proceeding,
not
to
the
side
of
it.
so
isn't
a
collateral
attack
--
another
proceeding
to
decide
a
subject
main
proceeding,
but
the
rule
35
motion
is
filed
in
the
criminal
proceeding
itself?
