justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
--
i
have
just
one
problem,
which
is
under
your
theory,
i
understand
it,
if
a
state
increases
a
penalty,
makes
what
would
have
been
a
penalty
for
a
misdemeanor
now
a
felony,
then
that
defendant
is
a
career
criminal,
by
your
logic.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
person
who
thought
that
at
the
time
they
committed
the
crime
they
were
committing
a
low-level
crime
is
now
a
felon;
is
that
your
theory
of
the
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
--
what
--
what
logic
do
you
think
there
is
in
that,
why
congress
would
want
to
punish
someone
now
for
--
for
criminal
activity
that
they
thought
was
lesser,
and
the
state
thought
was
lesser,
at
an
earlier
time,
less
reprehensible?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
how
do
you
see
that?
i
thought
the
government
had
two
alternative
positions,
the
first
being
that
you
look
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
at
the
conviction
or,
alternatively,
it
was
arguing
the
way
to
take
the
position
of
the
court
below.
but
if
you're
going
to
use
the
present
tense
then
you
look
retroactively
to
see
--
then
you
look
to
see
whether
the
state
would
retroactively
apply
the
new
sentence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
understood
their
brief
differently?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sure
they'll
tell
you.
[laughter]
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
--
just
to
clarify
your
point.
if
there's
been
a
modification
of
law
that
would
have
entitled
him
to
a
retroactive
change
in
his
sentence,
although
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
that
works,
because
if
there's
a
modification,
i
thought
it
would
only
apply
to
a
defendant
who
had
committed
the
crime
at
that
earlier
time
but
was
convicted
at
the
present
time.
this
defendant
wouldn't
have
his
sentence
modified.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
my
question.
is
your
footnote
related
to
that
kind
of
individual
only
or
are
you
saying
--
or
are
you
accepting
your
adversary's
argument
that
the
circuit
below
got
it
right?
you
look
at
the
is
as
to
what
the
sentence
would
be
today--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
this
person
had
committed
the
crime?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
just
trying
to
clarify
whether
you
mean
that
the
--
the
modification
had
to
have
occurred,
meaning
that
he
was
convicted,
he
got
10
years,
and
somewhere
for
some
state
reason,
that
actual
final
judgment
was
amended
to
include
5.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
or
are
you
talking
about--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--accepting
his
argument
that
if
he
could
apply
for
a
change
now--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--is
this
the
first
time
you're
advancing
the
argument,
the
first
part
of
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
doesn't
appear
as
you
did
--
if
you
did
it
below;
am
i
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
us
whether
changes
in
state
sentences
--
do
the
states
routinely
address
retroactivity?
or
do
they
leave
it
to
their
general
common
law?
or
do
you
have
any
idea
of
what--
