why
is
--
why
is
--
why
is
the
present
tense
inadequate
for
the
--
for
the
government's
position
in
this
case?
once
it
is
conceded
that
the
north
carolina
law
is
not
retroactive,
the
law
reducing
the
number
of
years,
it
is
the
case
that
what
is
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
for
the
offense
that
he
committed
--
how
many
years
ago
was
it,
whatever--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
the
maximum
punishment
for
that
offense
which
occurred
at
that
time
is
the
longer
period.
why
is
--
i
don't
see
why
your
argument
requires
us
to
ask
what
would
be
the
term
if
he
had
committed
the
offense
at
a
later
date.
the
maximum
term
for
his
offense
when
he
committed
it
is
those
years
because
the
state
did
not
retroactively
reduce
his
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
just
for
the
defendant;
it's
for
anybody
who
committed
it
prior
to
the
--
prior
to
the
amendment
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
anybody
that
committed
it
then,
the
--
the
--
it
is
an
offense
"involving
manufacturing,
distributing,
or
possessing
with
intent
to
manufacture
or
distribute
a
controlled.
"
"for
which
a
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
of
10
years
or
more
is
prescribed
by
law.
"
it
is
prescribed
by
law
for
any
of
those
offenses
that
occurred
between
whenever
that
old
statute
was
enacted
and
whenever
this
statute
was
enacted.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
correct?
you're
happy
with
that?
the
person
committed
a
felony
when
it
was
a
felony,
and
the
state
later
no
longer
makes
it
a
felony,
and
it
isn't
counted
for
purposes
of
the
armed
career
criminal
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
we
looking
at
it
because
we
want
the
states
to
determine
the
federal
sentence
or
are
we
looking
at
it
because
we
evaluate
the
evil
of
the
particular
defendant
on
the
basis
of
how
--
how
much
of
a
crime
he
was
willing
to
commit?
and
so
long
as
it
was
a
serious
felony
when
he
committed
it,
this
is
a
bad
actor.
i
don't
care
if
the
state
changes
its
view.
at
the
time,
he
was
willing
to
commit
a
felony
that
put
him
in
jail
for
10
years,
and
that's
what
we're
looking
to,
it
seems
to
me,
how
bad
an
apple
is
this
fellow
that
--
that
we're
talking
about
putting
away?
and
that
doesn't
change
simply
because
the
state
decides
in
the
future
that
that
same
act
will
not
be
a
felony.
well,
people
who
perform
that
act
in
the
future
aren't
so
bad;
they're
just
--
you
know,
just
normal
not-so-good
people--
[laughter]
--but
they're
not
the
kind
of
a
person
who's
willing
to
--
to
commit
a
felony
that,
you
know,
puts
them
away
for
10
years.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
what
the
federal
law
is
looking
to.
we're
not
giving
over
to
the
states
the
decision
of
--
of
how
long
we
should
incarcerate
somebody
in
a
federal
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree,
it
does
refer
to
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
but
it
refers
to
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
at
the
time
the
offense
was
committed
in
order
to
determine
how
bad
a
fellow
this
is,
not
--
not
because
we
want
the
states
to
determine
how
long
we're
going
to
keep
federal
prisoners
in
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
issue,
though,
really.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you'll
--
you'll
put
away
for
a
long
time
somebody
who
really
wasn't
that
bad
a
guy.
he
committed
a
misdemeanor,
and
when
the
state
later
makes
it
a
felony,
you
--
he
suddenly
comes
under
acca.
and
i
--
i
can't
believe
that
that's
--
that's
what
--
what
congress
had
in
mind
just
because
the
state
now
thinks
that
it's
more
serious.
who
cares
what
the
state
thinks?
we
--
we
want
to
know
how
bad
an
actor
this
particular
defendant
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
it's
so
hard.
i
--
i
could
find
my
way
clear
to
saying
that
if
it
has
been
retroactively
made
a
--
a
--
a
lesser
offense,
that
that
would
qualify
under
--
under
the
statute.
i
don't
know
why
you
insist
that
his
actual
conviction
be
--
be
altered.
