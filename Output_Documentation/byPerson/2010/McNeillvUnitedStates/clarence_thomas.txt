justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
the
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
known
as
acca,
a
felon
who
unlawfully
possesses
a
firearm
is
subject
to
a
15-year
minimum
prison
sentence
if
he
has
--
has
three
prior
convictions
for
violent
felonies
or
serious
drug
offenses.
as
relevant
here,
the
statute
defines
a
serious
drug
offense
as
a
state
drug
trafficking
offense
for
which
"a
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
of
10
years
or
more
is
prescribed
by
law".
the
question
in
this
case
is
how
a
federal
sentencing
court
should
determine
what
maximum
sentence
is
prescribed
by
law
for
a
defendant's
previous
state
drug
offense.
petitioner
clifton
mcneill
pleaded
guilty
to
unlawful
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
felon.
the
district
court
determined
that
acca
applied
based
in
part
on
mcneill's
six
prior
state
drug
trafficking
convictions.
mcneill
argued
that
his
prior
convictions
were
not
for
serious
drug
offenses
because,
although
those
offenses
each
carried
a
10-year
maximum
sentence.
when
he
was
convicted
of
them,
the
state
had
since
reduced
the
maximum
penalty
for
those
offenses.
the
district
court
rejected
mcneill's
argument
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
for
prior
state
offense
for
acca
purposes.
a
federal
sentencing
court
must
consult
the
law
that
applied
to
the
defendant's
offense
at
the
time
of
his
state
conviction
for
that
offense.
the
plain
text
of
the
statute
allows
no
other
interpretation.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
