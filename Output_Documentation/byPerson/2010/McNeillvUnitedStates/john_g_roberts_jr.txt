we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
10-5258,
mcneill
v.
united
states.
mr.
gordon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
state--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
if
the
state
change
is
to
abolish
the
offense
altogether?
do
we
--
do
we
not
have
any
predicate
offense
for
the
defendant
who
committed
the
crime
prior
to
the
abolition
of
the
state
offense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
strikes
me
that
there's
really
no
change
in
the
state
view
of
how
serious
it
is.
it
was
just
an
overall
change
in
how
they're
going
to
look
at
sentencing.
under
the
prior
regime,
you're
sentenced
to
a
particular
term,
but
in
fact
you
serve
a
lot
less.
with
the
new
treatment
in
sentencing,
you're
sentenced
to
what
is
a
much
--
a
smaller
term,
but
you
in
fact
are
going
to
serve
the
whole
thing.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
there's
no
real
change
in
how
they
view
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.

you,

gordon.

mr.

mr.
gordon,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
