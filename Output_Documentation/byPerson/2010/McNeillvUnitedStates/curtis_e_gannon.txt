mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
was
convicted
under
north
carolina
law
of
multiple
offenses
subject
to
a
10-year
maximum
term
of
imprisonment,
and
he
actually
received
10-year
sentences
for
his
drug
crimes.
he
now
claims
that
those
convictions
are
not
ones
for
which
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
is
at
least
10
years
for
purposes
of
acca's
definition
of
serious
drug
offense.
that
result
is
incorrect,
because
the
sentencing
court
should
consider
the
offense
and
the
punishment
as
they
were
defined
by
the
body
of
law
under
which
the
defendant
was
convicted
and
sentenced.
this
is
the
simplest
approach,
because
the
court
is
already
looking
to
the
statute
at
the
time
of
the
underlying
conviction
in
order
to
evaluate
whether
it
satisfies
the
substantive
component
of
the
definition
of
a
serious
drug
offense.
and
if
i
can
start
where
justice
sotomayor
finished
with
my
friend,
we
have
one
footnote
in
the
first
part
of
our
argument,
footnote
5,
which
clarifies
an
issue
that
isn't
at
stake
here,
which
is
that
when
we
say
that
you
need
to
look
to
the
time
of
the
underlying
conviction,
that
that
includes
the
time
of
the
sentencing
which
could
include
some
sentence
modification
proceedings.
if
the
state
had
amended
the
law
in
the
meantime,
made
it
retroactively
applicable
and
the
defendant
were
able
to
get
his
judgment
or
conviction
modified,
then
we
would
not
insist
that
--
that
he
still
had
an
offense
that
was
subject
to
a
10-year
maximum
term
of
imprisonment.
and
we
think
that
this
approach
is
consistent
with
what
the
court
said
in
rodriguez,
where
it
was
also
evaluating
the
serious
drug
offense
under
acca
and
pointed
us
to
the
documents
associated
with
the
judgment
of
conviction.
it
recognizes
that
the
relevant
question
here
is
the
body
of
law
that
applied
to
this
particular
defendant
in
his
offense.
and
--
and
it's
the
term
"conviction"
that
actually
points
us
to
that
in
the
statute.
the
question
is
what
is
the
sentencing
regime
associated
with
the
defendant's
actual
conviction,
and
the
government's--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
highly
extraordinary
circumstance.
there
may
be
an
instance
where
the
state
legislature
has
actually
amended
the
law,
made
it
retroactive
and
said
that
it's
applicable
to
people
who
had
final
convictions
beforehand
i--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--the
footnote--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--the
footnote
in
part
a
of
the
government's
brief
is
--
is
not
consistent
with
the
court
of
appeals
approach.
we're
saying
that
under
our
principal
reading
which
is
at
the
relevant
time,
at
the
time
of
the
conviction,
that
that
includes
the
sentencing
associated
with
that
conviction;
and
in
certain
unusual
circumstances
that
may
well
include
a
sentence
modification
proceeding
that
occurred
sometime
after
the
fact.
but
in
any
event
it's
going
to
be
a
previous
conviction
that
needs
to
be
on
the
books
at
the
time
of
the
922(g)
offense.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
it
--
in
--
we
think
that
it
has
to
be
under
the
documents
associated
with
his
judgment
of
conviction.
so
it
would
matter
that
he
had
been
successfully
able
to
obtain
modification
of
the
--
the
judgment
associated
with
his
conviction.
in
those
circumstances
it
would
be
appropriate
to
say
that
the
body
of
law
that
applied
to
his
conviction
was
one
that
specified
only
the
lower
punishment.
that's
obviously
not
an
issue
here
because
the
state
hasn't
made
any
of
these
relevant
changes
retroactively
applicable
to
any
offense
that
was
committed
before
the
first
of
october
in
1994.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
it--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--we
--
we
did
not
advance
this
below.
we
weren't
heard
on
the
question
at
district
court.
the
district
judge
adopted
this
argument
in
response
to
petitioner's
objection
to
the
psr
which
had
taken
this
position.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
petitioner
relied
upon
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
in
morton,
and
we
--
we
responded
the
essentially
the
way
the
fourth
circuit
did,
which
is
to
say
the
fifth
circuit
has
distinguished
instances
like
that
when
the
court
has
not
--
when
the
state
has
not
made
the
--
the
intervening
decrease
in
the
sentence
retroactively
applicable.
that's
the
interpretation
that
the
fourth
circuit
adopted.
but
the
government
has
made
this
argument
before
in
--
in
the
second
circuit
in
darden,
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
hinojosa,
in
the
--
in
the
sixth
circuit
in
morton
in
the
1994
decision.
the
government
has
made
this
lead
argument
that
we're
making
today
in
addition
to
the
fallback
argument
that
the
--
that
the
fourth
circuit
adopted
here,
and
that
the
fifth
circuit
adopted
in
--
in
hinojosa.
but
i
would
note
that
the
lead
argument
that
we're
making
today
has
several
advantages
that
make
it
preferable
to
the
fallback
argument.
some
of
them
have
already
been
brought
up
today.
i
already
mentioned
the
fact
that
this
is
simpler,
because
it
requires
the
judge
to
just
look
to
one
time
to
evaluate
the
substantive
component
of
the
definition
and
the
--
the
sentence
component
of
the
definition.
but
this
also
prevents
the
types
of
problems
that
justice
alito
addressed
earlier
that
may
arise
when
the
state
has
amended
the
definition
of
the
offense.
if
you
just
look
to
the
--
the
actual
offense
at
the
time
of
the
conviction,
then
you
don't
run
into
those
sorts
of
problems,
and
the
fifth
circuit
recognized
this
in
its
allen
decision
and
therefore
ended
up
having
to
adopt
what
is
essentially
the
government's
lead
argument
here.
the
sixth
circuit
which
generally
follows
petitioner's
rule
also
ended
up
adopting
the
government's
lead
argument
in
the
context
of
a
guidelines
determination,
because
it
recognized
that
it
--
it
was
unwilling
to
assume
that
a
conviction
simply
disappears
when
the
state
has
modified
the
definitions
in
such
a
way
that
you
can't
precisely
translate
into
current
terms
what
the
underlying
offense
of
conviction
is.
the
government's
reading
avoids
that
problem
because
it
doesn't
require
you
to
recharacterize
the
old
offense
at
all.
it
just
says
what
was
he
convicted
of?
what
was
the
maximum
sentence
associated
with
that
offense
at
the
time
he
was
actually
prosecuted?
there's
nothing
hypothetical
about
it.
and
as
the
--
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
rodriguez,
we
would
expect
a
lot
of
the
documents
association
with
a
judgment
of
conviction
to
make
this
a
relatively
easy
inquiry
to
answer
what
was
the
maximum
sentence
at
the
relevant
time.
this
--
the
reading
also
avoids
the
difficulty
that
justice
sotomayor
pointed
out
that
--
that
is
associated
with
later
increases
in
--
in
the
sentence.
under
the
government's
view,
if
you
committed
an
offense
at
a
time
when
it
was
subject
to
a
10-year
punishment,
congress
has
reasonably
assumed
that
you
are
a
dangerous
person;
but
that
congress
could
also
reasonably
assume
that
there's
a
distinction
between
somebody
who
commits
an
offense
at
a
time
when
it's
subject
to
a
10-year
term
of
imprisonment
and
someone
else
who
commits
that
offense
at
a
different
time
when
it's
subject
to
only
a
30-month
term
of
imprisonment.
and
so
under
north
carolina
law,
for
instance,
the
--
the
felony
of
manufacture
of
methamphetamine
went
from
being
a
class
h
felony
which
is
subject
to
a
30-year
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
to
being
a
class
c
felony
--
excuse
me,
a
30-month
maximum
term
of
imprisonment,
to
a
class
c
felony,
which
is
subject
to
a
19-year
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
on
december
1st,
2004.
and
we
think
it's
reasonable
for
congress
to
assume
that
somebody
who
committed
the
crime
of
manufacturing
methamphetamine
in
north
carolina
at
a
time
when
it
was
subject
to
a
30-month
maximum
sentence
is
not
as
dangerous
as
somebody
who
was
willing
to
commit
the
same
offense
at
a
time
when
it
was
subject
to
a
19-year
maximum
term
of
imprisonment.
and
the
government's
approach
by
--
by
requiring
the
court
to
look
to
the
time
of
the
underlying
conviction
and
sentencing
unifies
the
inquiry
across
both
components
of
the
definition
of
serious
drug
offense
and
the
definition
of
violent
felony
that
justice
kagan
alluded
to
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
argument,
that
the
definition
of
violent
felony
includes
present-tense
references
to
whether
a
crime
is
burglary,
the
question
of
whether
it
is
punishable
by
a
--
by
a
term
exceeding
12
months,
which
is
necessary
to
establish
that
it's
a
felony
is
one
that
--
that
we
believe
needs
to
be
made
at
the
time
of
the
underlying
conviction.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
congress
has
given
us
a
very
objective
and
simple
yardstick
to
look
to
and
that's
just
what
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
is.
and
if
--
if
the
state
actually
thinks
that
the
previous
offenses
that
were
committed
were
less
serious,
then
it
could
make
the
decreased
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
retroactively
applicable
if
--
if
it
wanted
to
demonstrate
that
--
that
it
really
thought
that
those
were
mistakes.
but
that's
not
the
approach
that
south
carolina
has
taken
--
that
north
carolina
has
taken
here.
it
has
said
that
for
crimes
that
were
committed
before
october
1st,
1994,
the
prior
sentencing
regime
still
applies.
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
before,
the
state
has
not
repudiated
the
judgment
that
these
were
serious
offenses,
not
--
not
--
not
only
with
respect
to
when
they
were
committed,
but
the
entire
shift
to
structured
sentencing
petitioner
acknowledges--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--wasn't
intended--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
it's
possible
that
the
state
could
--
could
provide
a
mechanism
by
which
he
could
have
the
documents
associated
with
his
prior
judgment
amended
to
reflect
the
fact
that
he
--
he
ought
not
to
have
been
subjected
to
the
--
to
the
greater
term
of
imprisonment.
i
think
that
that's
probably
the
hardest
case,
somebody
who
once
upon
a
time
actually,
like
this
petitioner,
did
a
10-year
term
of
imprisonment
for
--
for
the
sentence,
the
state
in
retrospect
concludes
that
the
offense
had
not
been
that
serious
even
at
the
time,
and
if
he
had
been
prosecuted
today
he
--
he
should
have
received
only
a
5-year
maximum
term
of
imprisonment.
i
think
--
i
think
that
that's
--
that's
an
instance
where
it
--
it
might
be
difficult
to
--
to
--
to
find
a
way
in
the
statute
to
say
that
acca
doesn't
apply
to
him,
that
he
did
not
have
a
previous
conviction
at
the
relevant
point
in
time.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
--
i
think
that
we
would
obviously
still
prevail
under
an
approach
like
that.
it
would
be
an
expansion
of
what
we
proposed
in
footnote
5.
we
think
that
the
relevant
inquiry
starts
with
the
conviction,
but
if
--
if
the
court
were
to
ask
in
the
context
of
the
body
of
law
that
applies
to
his
offensive
conviction,
whether
the
state
has
changed
its
mind
by
doing
--
by
altering
the
precise
yardstick
that
congress
has
directed
the
court
to
look
to,
then
--
then
i
think
that
--
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
way
to
deal
with
it.
i'm
not
exactly
sure
how
you
get
it
out
of
the
words
of
the
statute,
but
it
--
it
would
solve
the
problem
for
--
for
cases
like
this
of
somebody
who
had
been
unable
to
take
advantage
of
a
sentence
modification
type
of
proceeding.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
several
states
have
specific
saving
statutes
like
the
federal
government
does
in
1
u.s.c.
109.
at
least
three
states
have
constitutional
provisions
that
effectively
are
something
like
a
saving
statute.
sometimes
they
have
background
common
law
principles.
in
any
instance,
these
types
of
general
provisions,
except
where
the
constitutional
provisions
exist,
could
be
overcome
by
the
state
legislature
in
a
particular
statute,
just
as
is
the
case
with
the
federal
savings
statute.
a
state
legislature,
if
it
wants
to
be
express
about
the
retroactive
applicability
of
a
change,
would
be
able
to
do
that.
there
may
be
limitations
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause
of
its
increasing
the
severity
of
punishment,
but
for
something
like
a
decrease,
there
--
there
would
be
fewer
limitations.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the--
