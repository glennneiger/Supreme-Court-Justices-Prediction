mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
this
court
construes
a
statute,
the
words
of
the
statute
matter,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
matters,
and
the
results
produced
by
that
construction
matter.
when
congress
defined
in
the
armed
career
criminal
act
a
10
years
or
more
is
prescribed
by
law,
it
meant
for
federal
courts
to
look
to
the
law
presently
in
effect
in
that
state.
this
is
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
statute,
and
words
matter.
it
is
also
consistent
with
acca's
purpose,
which
is
punish
the
federal
firearms
offense,
and
if
we
are
going
to
punish--
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
--uh--
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
--if
--
if
a
state
were
to
increase
a
penalty
--
say
from
originally
it
was
5
years,
increased
it
to
10
years,
the
defendant
was
convicted
at
a
time
when
it
was
5
years
--
if
the
legislature
increased
the
penalty,
if
the
defendant
possessed
a
firearm,
yes,
he
would
be
facing--
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
--because
the
purpose
of
the
armed
career
criminal
act
is
not
to
enhance
a
sentence
because
of
the
prior
conviction.
it
is
because
the
federal
firearm
offense
at
the
time
it
was
committed
is
more
serious
based
on
--
based
on
its
repetitive
nature,
as
this
court
has
said.
so
therefore
looking
to,
when
the
defendant
commits
the
offense,
what
his
status
is
at
that
time
under
the
law
we
think
makes
sense
and
is
consonant
with
the
purpose
of
what
acca
is
trying
to
do.
acca
is
not
trying
to
punish
the
state
offense
at
the
time.
and
of
course
the
converse,
your
honor,
is
that
by
adopting
the
government's
reading,
is
individuals
who
at
a
time
committed
an
offense
when
a
state
at
that
time
viewed
an
offense
as
more
serious
but
now
has
changed
its
view
of
the
offense,
does
not
view
it
as
being
as
serious,
that
person
also
would
receive
a
15-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct.
where
we
fundamentally
disagree
with
the
government
and
with
the
fourth
circuit
is
on
the
significance
of
retroactivity.
we
--
the
statute
requires
--
or
the
statute
directs
us
to
look
at
the
penalty
that
is
prescribed
for
the
offense,
the
offense
in
its
generic
context.
it
--
it
is
not
about
what
the
circumstances
of
the
defendant
were
that
produced
the
particular
conviction
for
him.
no
one
who
commits
the
trafficking
offenses
that
mr.
mcneill
committed
today
is
going
to
be
facing
a
10-year
sentence.
it's
not
going
to
happen
to
anyone
who
commits
the
offense
from
today
forward.
and
we
think
that
is
where
the
statute
directs
us
to
look:
what
is
the
penalty
for
the
generic
offense?
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
there
--
there
are
two
possible
answers,
justice
alito.
first,
the
court
could
look
to
what
the
offense
is
now,
could
look
back
to
what
the
defendant
did
consistent
with
shepard
and
so
forth,
and
see
if
the
defendant's
conviction
contains
the
element
of
the
--
the
elements
that
apply
to
the
present
offense.
if
the
court
could
not
do
that,
then
the
conviction
would
count
for
purposes
of
the
defendant's
criminal
history.
it
would
not
count
as
an
acca
predicate,
and
the
district
court
would
then
be
limited
to
a
10-year
sentence
as
opposed
to
a
15-to-life
sentence.
so
consistent
with
--
with
its
purpose,
we
think
that
the
statute
should
be
read
as
speaking
to
the
time,
not
of
the
state
conviction
--
not
of
the
state
sentence.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
yes?
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
well,
justice
ginsburg,
it
may
be
an
academic
exercise
for
mr.
mcneill
or
for
the
mr.
mcneills
of
the
world.
the
judge
would
--
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with
us,
the
judge
could
impose
consecutive
sentences
on
a
remand
and
still
achieve
the
same
sentence,
yes.
for
someone
whose
only
offense,
however,
is
a
922(g)
conviction,
then
it
makes
a
huge
difference
because,
rather
than
looking
at
a
15-year
mandatory
minimum
penalty,
the
defendant
would
be
looking
at
no
more
than
10
years.
so,
the
judge's
--
it
would
be
significantly
cabined
in
--
in
that
sense.
and
the
other,
with
respect
to
the
mr.
mcneills
of
the
world,
the
judge
on
a
remand
is
still
going
to
be
required
to
calculate
the
guidelines
correctly.
and
so
if
the
guidelines
change,
if
they
go
down
in
this
case,
for
the
judge
to
achieve
a
300-month
sentence,
the
judge
is
going
to
have
to
state
reasons
again
and
arguably
more
significant
reasons
to
--
to
achieve
that
same
level
if
he's
working
from
a
lower
guideline
range.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
justice
kagan,
i
think
you
would,
in
this
sense:
for
the
violent
felony
provision,
there
is
a
generic
offense.
let's
take
burglary.
there
is
this
existing
thing
right
now
called
burglary.
what
a
taylor
analysis
does
is
it
looks
backward
to
what
the
defendant
did.
it
looks
to
see
what
those
elements
are.
it
takes
those
elements
and
brings
it
forward,
and
if
those
elements
fit
in
the
box,
then
what
he
did
is
a
burglary.
if
it
does
not,
then
it
is
not
a
burglary.
the
--
so,
that's
my
essential
answer
to
that.
is
it--
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
--early
'90s,
your
honor.
yes,
'91,
'92.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
that's
correct
for
mr.
mcneill.
the
penalty
for
him
--
he
would
be
facing
an
exposure
of
10
years.
the
penalty,
however,
that
everyone
else
--
the
penalty
that
is
currently
prescribed
in
north
carolina
for
someone
who
commits
mcneill's
offenses
is
not
10
years
and,
and
depending
on
where
they
fall
in
the
prior
record
level,
their
maximum
sentence
is
considerably
less
than
10
years.
so
we
do
not
think
it's
consonant
with
the
statute
to
look
to
the
circumstances
of
the
individual
defendant.
congress
easily
could
have
said
"for
which
a
penalty
of
10
years
or
more
is
prescribed
for
the
defendant.
"
we
think
that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
it
is
prescribed
only
if
you
take
the
offense
out
of
the
category
of
a
generic
offense.
it
is
not
--
it
is
--
it
is
not
prescribed
for
the
generic
offense.
it
is
prescribed
for
particular
defendants
who
committed
the
offense
at
a
certain
point
in
time.
and,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
raises
a
rather
fundamental
question,
which
is
if
we're
going
--
if
we
really
are
punishing
the
federal
firearm
offense
and
we
are
not
punishing
the
defendant
for
the
prior
conviction,
and
we
have
two
individuals
who
commit
a
922(g)
offense
and
they
have
similar
records,
but
they
sustain
their
state
convictions
on
different
days,
do
we
want
to
treat
them
the
same
for
purposes
of
where
they
--
of
the
federal
offense
or
do
we
want
to
distinguish
them
on
the
basis
of
the
state
convictions?
do
we
want
the
state
convictions
to
really--
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
your
honor,
yes.
if
--
if,
as
i
said
earlier,
you
could
not
determine
from
the
prior
conviction
whether
there
is
any
present
state
offense
that
might
be
called
something
different,
but
that
has
those
drug
trafficking
elements
that
the
statute
requires,
if
you
cannot
determine,
you
know,
from
shepard-approved
documents
and
so
forth,
yes,
we
think
for
purposes
of
the
armed
career
criminal
enhancement
only
that
that
would
disappear.
that's
correct.
i
do
want
to
stress,
because
i
think
it's
important
to
stress,
that--
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
--yes?
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
only
for
purposes
of
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
yes.
it
certainly
would
count
as
a
prior
conviction.
it
would
count
as
a
prior
conviction,
for
example,
for
922(g)
purposes.
this
person
could
still
be
prosecuted
for
being
a
felon
in
possession,
yes.
so,
we
do
not
--
our
reading
is
not
opening
the
jail
house
door
for
anybody.
they
are
still
facing
a
hefty
10-year
sentence.
the
question
is,
in
a
statute
that
defers
to
the
judgment
of
the
states
to
determine
seriousness,
are
we
going
to
defer
to
the
current
state
assessment
of
what
seriousness
is
or
are
we
going
to
look
back
to
repeal
the
discarded
judgments?
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
arguably
yes.
but
for
purposes
of
the
serious
drug
offense
definition,
what
we
have
to
use
is
the
penalty.
we
have
to
look
at
the
penalty
as
the
state
--
as
the
state's
proxy,
if
you
will,
for
seriousness.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
justice
scalia,
if
--
if
that
were
indeed
what
congress
wanted,
then
it
would
have
written
the
statute
differently.
there
would
be
something
in
that
definition
about
the
defendant,
and
there's
not.
it's
about
the
offense.
so
the
--
the
judgment
that
the
state
is
making
is
about
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
itself,
and
as
we
made
an
effort
to
argue
in
our
briefs,
state
views
of
drug
offenses
change.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
justice
scalia,
respectfully,
i
--
i
don't
agree
with
that.
respectfully--
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
--that
is
an
issue,
yes,
justice
scalia.
but
the
issue
is,
do
you
look
at
the
defendant.
do
you
say
congress
was
really
talking
about
trying
to
get
the
mr.
mcneills
any
way
we
can
or
we
are
--
we
are
interested
in
people
who
commit
an
offense
that
the
state
currently
regards
as
serious.
you
will
capture
mr.
mcneills;
you
will
also
capture
people
who,
you
know,
under
the
old
texas
law
that,
you
know,
prescribed
99
years
for
someone
who
might
have
sold
one
or
two
marijuana
cigarettes
as
well.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
in
the
case
of
a
misdemeanor
--
justice
sotomayor
asked
earlier
about
misdemeanors
and
felonies
--
there
may
be
some
additional
constitutional
issues
in
terms
of
whether
if
it's
a
misdemeanor
conviction,
even
statutory
reasons,
if
it's
a
misdemeanor
conviction,
whether
it
should
count.
i
think
it
works
that
way
in
the
violent
felony
prong,
for
example,
where
the
term
that
you
look
at
is
was
it
1
year.
but
that
is
--
that
is
not
the
proxy
for
seriousness
because
there
is
another
provision,
18
u.s.c.
section
921(a)(20),
that
exempts
2-year
misdemeanors.
so
--
so,
the
1
year
in
the
violent
felony
provision
is
not
serving
the
same
purpose
that
--
that
the
10
years
is
in
the
serious
drug
offense.
a
reason
that
congress
may
have
had
for
doing
that
is
to
say
that
if
we
are
going
to
hit
somebody
with
15
years,
we
want
to
make
sure
that
they
had
their
constitutional
rights
at
the
time
they
sustained
the
predicate
conviction,
had
a
right
to
counsel,
indictment,
jury,
and
so
forth.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
what
--
what
i
meant
to
say,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
if
you
are
--
if
you
continue
to
be
talking
about
a
felony
offense,
if
it
goes
from
5
years
to
10
years,
it
went
from
a
felony
to
another
felony,
in
that
circumstance
i
--
i
--
i
will
concede
our
reading
of
the
statute
would
work
to
the
detriment
of
that
defendant,
that
--
that's
correct.
what
i
was
simply
trying
to
say
about
the
misdemeanor-felony
is
that
there
might
be
some
additional
constitutional
issues
that
would
not
be
present
in
--
if
it
went
from
5
years
to
10
years.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there
would
be.
the
defendant
presumptively
is
on
notice
that
the
law
has
changed.
now,
if
--
if
the
increase
in
the
penalty
were
between
the
time
that
he
commits
the
922(g)
offense
and
the
time
of
the
sentencing,
yes,
i
think
you
have
ex
post
facto
concerns
there.
i
think
if
you're
talking
about
between
the
time
of
the
state
offense
and
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
firearm
offense,
i
don't
think
it
raises
the
ex
post
facto
concerns.
again,
the
defendant
is
on
notice,
he's
presumed
to
know
what
the
law
is
at
the
time
he
commits
the
federal
offense,
and
that's
what
we
care
about
here.
i
--
i
would
also
like
to
return
to
the
question
of
retroactivity
for
just
a
moment
and
note
that
in
terms
of
the
administerability
of
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
the
question
of
retroactivity
would
introduce,
if
the
government's
reading
is
adopted,
problems
that
do
not
exist
under
reading
acca
speaking
in
the
present
tense.
under
the
government's
approach,
it
is
not
simply
that
you
can
look
at
what
the
sentence
was
that
the
defendant
received
in
state
court.
the
government
says
retroactivity
matters.
so
you
would
still
have
to
go
to
the
present
penalty,
and
then
you
would
have
to
conduct
an
inquiry
into
what
the,
you
know,
what
changes
occurred
in
the
law,
were
any
of
them
retroactive,
were
they
retroactive
for
a
certain
period
of
time,
et
cetera.
so,
it--
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
your
honor,
i
read
the
brief
differently?
if
--
and
if
my
reading
is
incorrect,
i
apologize.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
yes,
i'm
sure
they
will.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
stephen
c.
gordon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
the
government
talks
about,
again,
the
problems
arising
if
--
if
a
statute
is
amended,
and
so
forth.
again,
i
would
like
to
analogize
that
to
the
violent
felony
prong
of
acca.
predicate
convictions
disappear.
things
that
were
predicate
convictions
cease
to
be
when
this
court
interprets
a
particular
offense
as
not
qualifying
as
a
violent
felony,
then
--
then
individuals
who
had
committed
that
offense
it
disappears
as
--
as
a
predicate.
so
it
is
--
it
is
not
anomalous
for
that
to
happen.
the
government
speaks
about
looking
to
the
time
of
the
state
proceeding.
it
is
--
that
--
that
--
that
approach
overlooks
that
changes
to
drug
laws
very
well
could
reflect
a
normative
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
--
of
the
legislature,
and
the
question
is
whether
--
whether
in
the
way
it
wrote
the
statute,
congress
wanted
--
wanted
to
defer
to
those
state
judgments.
texas
and
new
york
changed
their
sentencing
laws
because
they
judged
them
to
have
been
too
harsh,
that
--
that
they
treated
as
more
serious
offenses
than
--
than
those
offenses
actually
were.
we
see
that
today
with
the
issue
of
--
of
crack
cocaine.
and
under
the
government's
reading,
individuals
may
be
hit
with
--
with
an
acca
mandatory
minimum
on
the
basis
of
crack
convictions
sustained
at
a
time
when,
you
know,
the
view
of
crack
is
very,
very
different
from
what
it
is
now.
so
we
think
that
is
an
important
consideration
as
well.
the
question
of
retroactivity,
again,
as
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
it
does
not
--
the
savings
clause
in
north
carolina
was
a
general
savings
clause,
it
applied
to
every
single
offense
in
the
--
in
the
state.
it
was
not
a
reflection
of
the
--
of
the
legislature's
judgment
of
seriousness.
and
if
i
--
if
i
may
end
on
a
point
that
i
made
earlier,
the
question
for
this
court
really
is
when
do
you
want
to
treat
two
individuals
--
when
do
you
--
when
do
you
want
to
look
at
them?
do
you
want
to
look
at
them
at
the
time
of
the
federal
offense
or
do
you
want
to
look
at
them
in
terms
of
their
prior
state
convictions
and
come
to
a
conclusion
that
although
they
did
exactly
the
same
thing
in
the
state
court,
one
committed
a
serious
drug
offense,
one
did
not.
we
think
that
is
an
absurd
result.
it's
not
a
fair
result,
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit.
thank
you
very
much.
