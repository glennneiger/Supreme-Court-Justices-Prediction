mr.
gordon,
there
are
other
provisions
in
acca
which
seem
to
use
the
present
tense
in
circumstances
where
it
doesn't
seem
as
though
the
statute
truly
means
the
present
tense.
so,
a
violent
felony
is
one
that
"has
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force,
is
burglary,
arson,
or
extortion,
involves
use
of
explosives.
"
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
but
we
would
not
look
as
to
--
in
interpreting
that
provision
to
the
present
day,
would
we?
