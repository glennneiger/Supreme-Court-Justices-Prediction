mr.
gordon,
the
state
does
regard
it
--
it
does
--
prescribe
10
years
for
this
defendant
because
it's
made
a
--
made
the
change
not
retroactive.
so
a
maximum
of
10
years
is
prescribed
for
mr.
mcneill,
and
all
others
who
committed
the
offense
prior
to
the
change
in
law.
so
it
is
--
it
is
the
state's
current
position
that
for
this
defendant
the
maximum
is
10
years.

mis--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
gordon,
is
this
--
is
this
essentially
an
academic
question?
because
this
district
judge
said
that
he
would
impose
the
same
sentence
as
a
variant
even
if
he
couldn't
do
it
under
the
guidelines,
even
if
it
were
an
incorrect
calculation.
he
said:
this
criminal
record
is
violent
and
astonishing;
essentially,
i'm
going
to
throw
the
book
at
him,
and
i'm
going
to
do
it
through
a
variant
if
that's
no
--
if
there's
no
other
way.
so
isn't
that
--
i
mean,
isn't
this
an
--
an
exercise,
essentially
an
academic
exercise,
if
--
if
your
--
your
client
would
end
up
in
the
same
place?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
urging
now.
are
--
are
you
modifying
or
retracting
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
sotomayor,
that
is,
the
case
where
the
maximum
was
5
years,
but
then
at
the
time
of
the
federal
offense
the
state
has
changed
it
so
it's
10
years?
i
--
i
think
you
answered
her
question
that
it
would
work
the
same
way,
that
what
mattered
is
how
the
state
currently
ranks
the
offense,
not
the
offender.
but
now
you
seem
to
be
saying
there
might
be
a
different
answer
when
the
state
increases
rather
than
decreases
the
penalty.
