justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
--
what
would
happen
in
this
situation?
a
defendant
is
convicted
under
a
state
statute
that
says
that
anybody
who
sells
between
1
ounces
--
1
ounce
and
5
ounces
of
a
particular
controlled
substance
is
guilty
of
a
felony
and
may
be
punished
by
imprisonment
for
a
certain
amount
of
time.
and
then
the
state
repeals
that
provision
altogether
and
enacts
a
new
provision
that
says
anybody
who
sells
between
1
ounces
--
1
ounce
and
8
ounces
is
punishable
by
a
certain
penalty.
and
now
the
question
comes
up
what
--
what
penalty
does
the
court
look
at
with
respect
to
the
earlier
offense
that
no
longer
exists
for
which
the
defendant
was
convicted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
legislature
decreases
the
penalty
because
it
really
has
taken
a
different
--
a
new
look
at
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
really
is
not
nearly
as
serious
as
we
--
as
we
previously
thought?
so
why
should
the
prior
judgment
about
the
severity
of
the
offense
be
taken
into
account
under
acca?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
if--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
if
they
had
repudiated
their
prior
normative
judgment?
and
--
and
even
--
what
if
they
even
had
made
it
--
made
the
new
sentence
retroactive,
but
a
particular
defendant
was
no
longer
in
prison,
so
wasn't
on
parole,
so
there
was
nothing
--
there
was
no
way
that
this
could
have
any
effect
on
that
person?
