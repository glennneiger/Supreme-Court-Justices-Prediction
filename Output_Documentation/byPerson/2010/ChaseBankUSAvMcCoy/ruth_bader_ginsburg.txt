mr.
waxman,
i
take
it
from
this
whole
discussion
that
you
are
recognizing
that
this
is
not
a
crystal-clear
regulation;
there
is
some
ambiguity,
and
that's
why
we
are
talking
about
how
much
deference
we
owe
to
the
agency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
why
are
we
getting
into
all
of
this,
because
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
federal
reserve
board
had
authority
to
issue
regulation
z.
there
is
no
question
about
what
authority
congress
gave
to
the
board.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
only
question
is,
so
the
board
adopts
regulation
z
and
then
a
question
comes
up,
what
does
it
mean?
well,
surely
the
board
that
wrote
the
rule
is
first
and
foremost
the
proper
interpreter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
palmore,
suppose
there
was
no
triggering
event,
but
in
the
initial
statement
the
company
said:
we
reserve
the
right
to
raise
the
interest
to
x
amount.
no
triggering
event,
just
a
reservation
of
the
right
to
raise
the
interest.
would
that
have
to
be
--
and
then
it
implements
that
later
on.
would
the
cardholder
have
to
have
notice
of
that
under
the
old
regs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
changes
the
rate
in
the
cardholder's
favor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
would
you
--
would
it
be
in
the
greater
interest
of
your
client
if
the
initial
notice
said,
we
are
going
to
raise
it
to
the
top,
no
discretion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
says,
we
prefer
one
notice
to
two.
so,
sorry,
we
can't
give
our
cardholders
that
benefit;
we
will
say
this
is
the
rate,
this
is
going
to
be
it.
then
we
will
spare
ourselves
a
second
notice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
know
the
highest
rate,
because
that
is
stated
in
the
original
notice,
and
you
could
shop
on
the
basis
of
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it's
fine
to
say
then,
federal
reserve
board,
this
regulation
that
you
had
and
that
you
explained
a
number
of
times
was
a
bad
one,
you
should
change
it
--
which
they
did.
but
you
are
up
against
a
regulation
that
both
sides
say
has
some
ambiguity,
but
that
the
board
has
said
what
it
meant
a
number
of
times.
so
is
--
is
the
court
free
to
say
the
new
rule
is
much
better
so
we
are
going
to
say
that's
what
the
old
rule
was
as
well,
in
the
face
of
what
the
board
has
said?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
problem
with
that
is
when
the
ninth
circuit
split
about
the
official
statement
and
judge
cudahy
gave
a
very
cogent
explanation
of
why
the
majority
is
just
dead
wrong
in
how
it
read
those
official
comments.
so
you
are
relying
on
what
two
judges
have
said
the
official
interpretation
was,
against
the
dissenting
opinion
and
the
board
itself
saying,
that's
what
we
meant
in
our
official
comments,
in
our
official
comments.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
about
the
invited
brief
in
the
first
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
we
getting
back
to
what
was
my
initial
question?
so
you
say
you
can't
have
flexibility
that
would
favor
the
cardholder;
if
the
initial
notice
is
to
count,
then
it
has
to
be
a
fixed
rate
and
the
company
can't
exercise
discretion
to
reduce
the
rate.
that's
what
you
are
saying:
a
fixed
rate
would
be
okay.
the
problem
with
this
is
the
company
provided
flexibility
to
reduce
the
rate
in
the
interest
of
the
cardholder.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
following
that
argument.
i
thought
that
the
new
regulation
says
now
any
time
there
is
a
change
in
the
rate,
whether
it
was
announced
originally
or
comes
up
later,
just
keeping
it
nice
and
simple,
a
rate
change,
you
send
notice.
and
that's
--
and
you
have
to
do
it
--
give
45
days
notice.
i
thought
that
is
what
the
new
regulation
was?
