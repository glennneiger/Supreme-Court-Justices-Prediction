mr.
gregory
a.
beck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
bank
must
provide
notice
of
a
change
in
terms
when,
after
prominently
disclosing
a
specific
purchase
rate
in
the
cardholder
agreement,
the
bank
then
changes
that
rate
--
then
changes
that
rate
based
on
a
reservation
of
discretion
in
the
fine
print
of
the
cardholder
agreement.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
changes
the
rate
--
the
rules,
the
regulations
as
they
exist
as
relevant
to
this
case,
provide
that
you
do
not
need
to
provide
notice
if
the
interest
rate
is
reduced.
is
that
your
question,
justice
ginsburg?
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
it
--
there
--
justice
ginsburg,
there
would
still
be
discretion.
and
we're
not
--
and
nothing
we
say
would
take
away
discretion
or
discourage
discretion.
we
are
simply
saying
that
either
the
--
the
credit
card
company
has
to
decide
specifically
what
rate
will
apply
beforehand
and
put
it
in
the
cardholder
agreement,
or
it
can
specify
a
range
of
possible
rates,
reserve
that
discretion,
and
then
when
it
decides
which
rate
it
wants
to
apply
it
would
then
inform
the
borrower
what
that
rate
is.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
right.
and
--
and
there's
--
but
there
has
been
no
showing
that
the
--
this
notice
cost
would
be
a
significant
burden
on
the
credit
card
companies.
and
the
important
thing
is
that,
if
you
don't
know,
if
you
don't
get
that
notice
and
all
you
know
is
that
the
credit
card
company
has
discretion
to
raise
the
rate,
then
you
never
know
for
sure
whether
your
rate
has
even
gone
up
or
not,
much
less
how
much
it's
gone
up.
so
you
never
have
that
opportunity
to
go
and
see
whether
there
is
a
better-priced
loan
available.
you
might
not
--
you
might
miss
an
opportunity
to
avoid
making
a
purchase
that
would
--
that
would
be
at
a
rate
higher
than
you
expected;
and
the
lack
of
that
--
that
ability
to
shop
between
loans
is
really
the
central
motivating--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--you
could,
but
you
wouldn't
know
that
the
rate
had
gone
up
at
all,
because
all
you
know
is
that
there's
a
maximum
rate,
and
the
--
and
the
credit
card
company
has
discretion
to
raise
the
rate
or
not.
so
absent
any
notice,
the
assumption
would
be
that
the
rate
hasn't
changed,
that--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--right.
you
--
you
don't
get
notice
on
your
next
statement,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
it
will
--
it
will
state,
your
honor,
it
will
state
on
the
statement
that
--
what
your
rate
is.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
but
it
will
not
tell
you
that
the
rate
has
changed
and
it
won't
tell
you
how
much
it
has
changed.
so
you
would
have
to
figure
that
out
by
yourself.
so
it
is
not
notice
of
a
change
in
that
sense.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
well--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--well,
that's
right
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
still
doesn't
solve
that
problem.
and
when
the
rate
is
applied
retroactively
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
cycle,
so
this
would
go
back
to
the
first
of
the
month
even
before
the
default
occurred,
as
happened
in
this
case,
then
the
problem
is
exacerbated
even
more.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
i
think
if
the
disclosure
was
specific
and
--
and
prominent,
as
required
by
the
initial
disclosures,
and
it
wasn't
retroactive,
then
i
think
the
best
reading
of
the
rules
would
be
you
would
not
need
to
disclose
that.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
right.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
well,
the
easy
answer
to
that
question
is
that
it
--
it's
different
because
the
regulation
specifies
a
different
result
in
each
case.
section
226.9(c)(2)
says
that
no
notice
is
required
when
any
component
of
the
finance
charge
decreases
or
is
changed
in
the
customer's
favor.
so
there
would
be
under
the
plain
language
of
the
regulation
no
need
to
--
to
provide
notice
there.
but
i
think
the
intent
of
the
question
is,
is
chase's
argument
about
there
is
no
practical
difference
between
the
two.
that
is,
there
is
basically
no
harm
from
--
from
not
telling
people
that
the
--
about
their
rate
change.
and
we
disagree
with
that
as
well,
first
of
all
because,
as
i
was
saying
to
justice
ginsburg,
you
need
to
have
the
notice
that
there
has
been
a
change
at
all
in
order
to
--
to
realize
that
you
might
want
to
avoid
making
extra
purchases
or
consider
--
not
throw
away
the
low
apr
offer
that
comes
in
the
mail,
for
example.
and
also,
aside
from
that,
we
think
that
when
you
have
only
a
--
a
maximum
rate,
that
is
basically
the
equivalent
of
a
range
of
possible
rates
between
the
initial
rate
and
the
maximum
rate.
and
that
undercuts
the
ability
to
compare
loans
at
the
time
of
the
cardholder
agreement,
even
before
the
whole
default
comes
into
play,
because
at
that
point
you
have
to
compare
two
loans
with
two
possible
ranges
of
rates,
and
the
key
factor
between
the
two,
the
value
of
the
two
loans,
is
how
the
credit
card
company
will
issue
--
will
use
its
discretion--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--well,
that's
--
that's
part
of
the
problem,
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
point
--
the
central
motivating
purpose
of
tila
is
to
provide
clear
and
up-front
and
specific
disclosures,
and
that
--
that
would
put
the
burden
on
the
consumer
to
--
to
look
into
the
fine
print
to
figure
out
the
conditions,
and
after
judging
all
the
applicability
of
those
conditions,
to
figure
out
how
it
would
apply
and
compare
with
other
loans.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
no,
definitely
not,
justice
ginsburg.
but--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
it
doesn't,
justice
breyer,
and
--
and
all
we're
saying
is
that
agencies
speak
with
varying
levels
of
authority,
and
--
and
those
different
methods
of
statement
make
a
difference
in
how
much
deference
will
go
to
those
statements.
and
what
we
have
here
is
the
official
staff
commentary
which
the
board
has
designated
as
the
official
source
of
--
of
interpretation
of
the
rules,
and
we
are
asking
the
court
to
--
to
read
those
rules
and
defer
to
those.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
i
think
that
the
board
itself
made
that
law
when
it
decided
that
it
would
issue
official
staff
commentary
through
a
notice
and
comment
process
and
interpret
the
rules
in
that
way.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
well,
we
--
we
think
that
justice
cudahy's
analysis
made
the
same
mistake
that
other
courts
have
made
in
examining
the
regulations,
which
is
to
defer
to
the
--
the
unofficial
statements
of
the
board,
the
board
or
the
board's
staff,
before
coming
to
a
conclusion
about
the
plain
meaning
of
the
official
regulations,
the
official
interpretation.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
well,
there
is
no
question
that
the
invited
brief
is
against
our
position,
and
we
certainly
wouldn't
argue
otherwise.
but--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--no,
we
don't
agree
that
the
regulation
is
ambiguous.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
that.
section
226.9
is
the
relevant
change
of
terms
provision
and
it
states
that
notice
is
required,
quote,
"whenever
any
term
required
to
be
disclosed
under
section
226
is
changed.
"
and
section
226.6
in
turn
states
that
there
is
a
required
disclosure
when
--
"of
each
periodic
rate
that
may
be
used
to
compute
the
finance
charge.
"
and
so
those
two
sections
working
together
say
that
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
disclose
when
there's
a
change
of
terms
and
--
and
that
one
of
the
terms
that
has
to
be
disclosed
is
the
interest
rate.
and
in
fact
the
interest
rate
is
the
most
important
disclosure--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--right.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
all
right.
but
i
don't
think
the
word
"may"
here
can
be
read
to
exclude
the
requirement
that
the
bank
also
disclose
the
rates
that
are
charged.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
but
even
--
even
the
board
and
even
chase
does
not
argue
that
you
have
to
disclose
the
actual
--
the
actual
purchase
rate
at
the
beginning
of
the
agreement.
everybody
agrees
that
that
has
to
be
disclosed
and
that
has
to
be
disclosed
with
specificity.
so
the
word
"may"
has
to
include
the
--
both
rates
that
might
be
applied
and
rates
that
are
applied.
and
the
reason
the
word
"may"
has
to
be
there
is
because
it's
quite
possible
that
a
--
that
a
rate
may
never
come
into
play.
for
example,
if
you
have
an
initial
rate
that
changes
at
the
end
of
6
months
and
you
leave
the
credit
card
before
the
6
months
are
up,
then
that
new
rate
will
never
come
into
play.
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
don't
also
have
to
disclose
the
rate
that
happened
at
the
beginning
of
the
credit
card
agreement.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
uh-huh.
and
i--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--well,
i
would
say
that
even
the
government
doesn't
--
doesn't
agree
with
that,
that
"may"
means
that.
because
that
would
--
the
government
doesn't
argue
initial
disclosures
don't
have
to
be
specific
and
don't
have
to
be
--
don't
have
to
be
made.
the
government's
argument
is
a
little
bit
different.
what
they
are
saying
is
that
the
word
226.9
means
contractual
terms
rather
than
credit
terms.
and
that's
a
different
argument
because
it
doesn't
--
it
wouldn't
--
it
wouldn't
affect
the
initial
disclosures.
it
would
only
--
it
would
only
mean
that
you
don't
have
to
give
subsequent
notice
if
you
haven't
changed
the
contract
in
the
first
instance.
and
so
these
are
actually
somewhat
--
somewhat
different
theories.
and
under
the
government's
theory,
there
would
be
no
role
for
section
226.9
to
play
because
you
would
--
the
only
times
it
would
come
into
play
is
when
there
is
a
change
in
the
contract.
and
any
time
there
is
a
change
in
the
contract,
under
the
basic
contract
law
of
every
state,
you
have
to
provide
notice
at
least
to
the
other
party
to
the
contract.
so
the
only
time
notice
would
be
required
under
section
226.9
would
be
when
the
--
when
contract
law
requires
that
notice
to
be
given
anyway.
and
even
worse
than
that,
it
would
--
it
would
actually
cut
back
on
the
required
notice
that
would
be
available
under
contract
law,
because,
for
example,
delaware
says
you
have
to
give
15
days
advance
notice
of
a
change
in
terms
to
a
credit
card
agreement
in
the
event
of
a
default.
and
under
this
reading,
you
would
--
even
if
the
creditor
changed
the
terms
of
the
contract,
as
in
increased
the
default
rate
above
the
maximum
that
the
contract
would
authorize
--
so
the
contract
says
we
can
charge
you
30
percent
in
the
event
of
a
default
and
you
impose
an
interest
rate
of
100
percent
--
then
even
in
those
circumstances,
you
only
have
to
provide
contemporaneous
notice
of
the
change.
so
you
would
basically
have
to
put
a
letter
in
the
mailbox
on
the
day
that
you
implement
the
new
100
percent
interest
rate
that
was
not
disclosed
in
the
initial
agreement.
and
our
submission
is
that
that
is
not
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
section
226.9.
and
it
is
true
that
the
rules
have
been
amended,
but
we
have
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
rules
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
--
of
the
board
which
enacted
those
rules
in
1981.
and
you
can't
assume
that
the
board
at
that
time
expected
a
set
of
rules
that
would
never
--
that
would
never
require
subsequent
notice
to
be
--
to
be
supplied
unless
there
is
a
change
in
the
terms
of
a
contract,
in
which
--
in
which
notice
would
have
to
be
required
anyway.
the
next
point
that
the
parties
--
aside
from
the
language
of
the
--
of
the
regulation
itself,
the
parties
rely
on
official
staff
commentary,
as
do
we,
in
supporting
their
position.
and
the
parties
argue
that
the
word
"specific"
allows
them
to
--
i'm
sorry
--
the
government
and
chase
bank
argue
that
the
word
"specific"
allows
them
to
specify
in
advance
only
the
maximum
rate
and
that
the
word
"specific"
encompasses
a
maximum,
and
the
circumstances
of
causing
that
maximum
to
go
in
effect
of
a
universal
default
situation,
where
if
you
default
to
any
creditor
or
make
a
late
payment
to
any
creditor,
then
it
triggers
the
new
rate,
which
goes
up
to
a
discretionary
maximum.
it's
our
contention
that
that
kind
of
situation
of
a
universal
default
and
a
discretionary
maximum
rate
is
not
a
specific
disclosure
under
any
sense
of
the
word.
and--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--that's
one
of
the
problems.
the
other
problems
are
that
the
triggering
event
is
not
specific
enough
and
that
it
applies
retroactively.
but
as
to
that
problem,
which
we
--
we
do
agree
is
a
problem,
that's
a
result
of
the
board's
decision
to
allow
reductions
in
interest
rates
without
requiring
notice.
and
if
it
were
true
that
that
meant
that,
there
is
no
point
in
giving
a
specific
interest
rate
because
it
could
always,
after
all,
be
lower--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--right.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
right.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
i
see
your
point,
justice
breyer.
but
i
would
say
that
when
you
are
talking
about
an
interpretation
of
an
interpretation,
you
are
even
further
away
from
the
original
congressional
intent
that's
empowering
these
kinds
of
interpretations.
so
i
don't
think
that
would--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--right.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
and
we
are
not
making
that
argument,
your
honor.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
--
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
interpretation,
you
have
to
judge
it
based
on
the
authority
that
comes
with
it
and
the
deliberation
that
comes
with
it.
and
in
this
case,
we
know
that
the
board
itself
has
designated
the
official
staff
commentary
with
notice
and
comment
process
as
the
way
that
it
wants
to
officially
interpret
rules.
and
there
is
a
good
reason
for
that,
because
the
board
was
concerned,
as
congress
was
concerned,
that
there
was
all
these
differing
interpretations
of
the
--
of
regulation
z
that
were
going
out
in
the
form
of
opinion
letters.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
i
think
--
i
think
auer--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--i
think
in
that
case
that
the
court
would
have
to
defer
to
some
degree
to
the
brief,
because
that
would
be
the
only
source
of
the
board's
opinion
in
that--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--the
regulation
and
the
official
staff
commentary.
but
i
would
also
say
that
that
deference
does
not
have
to
be
conclusive
and
it
should
not
be
given
the
force
of
law,
even
to
the
brief,
because
the
agency
has
said
that
it
doesn't
--
it
specified
the
official
staff
commentary
so
that
there
aren't
these
multiplicity
of
different
opinions
going
out,
interpretations
of
regulation
z
that
are
difficult
for
banks
to
access
to
figure
out
what
their
obligations
are
under
the
regulations.
and
--
and
so
the
board
itself
doesn't
want
opinion
letters
and
briefs
and
things
to
be
--
to
be
interpreted
as
with
the
force
of
law,
because
that
would,
you
know--
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
--i
think
that's
right
or
at
least
limit
that
deference.
i
think
that
the
court
should
at
least
--
at
least
view
the
brief
with
more
skepticism,
given
that
the
board
has
wanted
this
very
careful
deliberative
process
for
making
its
rules.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
yes,
but
in
that
case,
justice
kagan,
you
know
for
certain
anyone
who
has
a
bank
account
can
know
what
the
balance
of
that
bank
account
is.
so
there
is
no
uncertainty
about
whether
the
balance
triggering
event
is
satisfied.
and
then
there
no
uncertainty
about
what
the
resulting
rate
is
because
section
226.6
says
you
have
to
disclose
each
interest
rate
and
the
range
of
balances
to
which
it
is
applicable.
so
you
have
to
know
both
the
interest
rate
and
you
have
to
know
the
triggering
event.
and
that's
very
different
from
a
case
where
you
are
not
sure,
first
of
all,
whether
the
bank
is
going
to
use
its
discretion
at
all.
you
don't
know
for
sure
if
whether
there
is
anything
negative
on
your
credit
report
that
would
even
trigger
that
discretion
to
begin
with.
and
you
don't
know
if
the
discretion
is
triggered
what
the
rate
will
be
because
the
bank
reserves
discretion
to
set
it
anywhere
up
to
the
maximum.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
there
is
the
discretionary
difference,
for
example.
in
the
bank
situation
the
rate
is
automatic
and
it
does
not
base,
it
doesn't
just
trigger
an
exercise
of
discretion.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
for
that
i
would
look
to
section
226.6(a)(2),
which
says
that
each
periodic
rate
and
the
range
of
balances
to
which
it
is
applicable
must
be
set
forth
initially.
and
so
you
know
from
the
very
beginning
which
balances
on
your
account
would
trigger
a
certain
interest
rate.
so
there
is
no,
in
that
case
there
is
no
uncertainty.
but
the
other
difference
is
that
in
a
bank
account
situation,
you're
balance
either
above
the
maximum
or
below
the
maximum,
but
when
you
are
talking
about
universal
default,
it
is
not
always
going
to
be
obvious
to
you,
first
of
all,
whether
anyone
has
reported
anything
to
the
credit
agency.
oftentimes
certain
creditors
will
overlook
a
certain
late
payment,
for
example,
and
maybe
they
reported
one
and
it
might
not
show
up
on
your
experian
credit
report
for
months
or
years
later
and
then
you
will
not
know
at
what
point
it
comes
into
play.
so
the
only
way
to
know
for
sure
in
that
circumstance
is
to
subscribe
to
the
experian
credit
reporting
service
just
like
chase
does
so
that
you
would
know
when
there
are
any
negative
events
that
are
reported
to
the
credit
agency
that
would
possibly
trigger
chase's
discretion,
but
even
in
that
case
you
would
not
know
for
sure
whether
chase
had
implemented
its
discretion
or
not.
and
i
wanted
to
say
the
government,
its
own
interpretation
of
the
regulation
is,
especially
when
considering
the
amendment
is
itself
inconsistent.
because
the
government
says
that
the
new
regulation
fixed
the
problem.
but
the
new
regulation
uses
the
same
language
as
the
old
regulation
when
it
comes
to
what's
required
for
a
later
change.
it
does
carve
out
the
default
rate
situation
is
a
special
case.
but
for
every
other
kind
of
rate
increase
that
has
happened
subsequent
to
the
initial
disclosure,
it
still
uses
as
a
triggering
event
any
change
in
terms
required
to
be
disclosed
by
section
226.6.
and
if
it
were
true
that
what
the
board
wanted
to
do
was
fix
this
ambiguity
and
this
problem
that
was
set
forth,
that
was
in
the
original
regulations,
then
it
would
be
very,
very
unlikely
that
the
government
would
then
implement
the
same
language
in
the
amended
regulation
to
meet
that
same
ambiguity
in
place
rather
than
clarifying
exactly
when
subsequent
notice
would
be
required.
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
that's
why
i
am
saying
the
government
is
inconsistent
because
that's
what
the
government
says
that
it
does.
but
what
the
regulation
actually
says
in
226.6(c),
the
new
version,
any
change
required
to
be
disclosed
--
a
change
in
any
term
required
to
be
disclosed
within
section
226.6
is
the
same
thing.
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
new
subsection
g
that
applies
just
to
default
rates,
and
it
is
very
extensive
because
it
covers
a
lot
of
aspects
of
default
rates.
so
now
i
think
it
is
clear
that
default
rate
increases
would
have
to
be
disclosed,
so
the
problem
in
this
case
would
certainly
be
resolved.
but
the
government's
position
is
that
there
was
a
consolidation
of
all
change
notices
into
one
45
day
notice
period,
and
that's
not
clear
from
the
regulation
because
it
still
uses
this
same
ambiguous
language
that
was
in
the
old
version.
so
i
think
the
court
--
the
court
should
--
and
for
us
that's
an
independent
reason
for
the
court
to
view
skeptically
the
government's
submissions
in
this
case
and
view
it
with
some
skepticism
instead
of
granting
it
the
force
of
law.
the
court
should
consider
that.
the
board
itself
hasn't
adopted
a
consistent
interpretation
of
the
language
at
issue.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions?
mr.
gregory
a.
beck
thank
you,
your
honor.
