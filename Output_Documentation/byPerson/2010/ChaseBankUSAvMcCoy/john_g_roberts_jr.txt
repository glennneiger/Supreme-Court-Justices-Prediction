chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-329,
chase
bank
v.
mccoy.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
suppose--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--this
is
not
new
to
you,
is
it,
this
method
of
proceeding?
so
i
understand
--
so
before
you
move
in
the
direction
you
would
like
to,
i
understand
your
view
to
be
that
chevron
and
auer
apply
and
it's
consistent
with
mead
because
you
have
more
indications
that
congress
delegated
this
authority
to
the
board
than
were
present
in
mead?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
palmore.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
take
it,
apart
from
the
amendment
to
the
rule,
you
think
those
circumstances
provide
for
chevron/auer
deference.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
our
long
island
health
care
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
address
your
friend's
contention
that
because
the
notice
doesn't
occur,
the
notice
that
the
increase
has
gone
into
effect,
doesn't
occur
until
the
end
of
the
billing
cycle,
it's
a
retroactive
increase
without
notice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
is
correct
to
characterize
what
is
being
allowed
under
your
interpretation
as
an
increase
in
rates
without
notice?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
advanced
notice
is
notice,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
beck.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
just
saying
that
the
problem
that
justice
ginsburg
is
concerned
with
isn't
likely
to
come
up,
because
a
credit
card
issuer
realizes
he's
not
going
to
get
chosen
by
a
consumer
if
he
says
your
rate
is
going
to
be
somewhere
between
5
and
20
percent.
no
one's
going
to
sign
up
for
that
card.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
beck.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
waxman,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
