stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
you
can
also
read
mead
and
decide
what
it
says.
being
in
the
majority,
i
thought
the
dissent's
characterization
was
not
what
it
said.
i
mean,
the
dissent
--
the
dissent
can
write
what
it
wants
to
write.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
was
what
mead
said,
but
i
guess
there's
disagreement
about
that.
what
did
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but
i'm
sorry.
you
are
an
informed
reader
and
i
thought
mead
definitely
did
not
say
that.
that
was
the
dissent's
characterization
of
what
it
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
one
indicator.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
not
exclusive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
can't
an
agency
interpret
its
own
rules?
i
thought
there
was
a
long
line
of
cases,
udall
v.
whatever
it
was.
i
mean,
there
are
like
50
of
them--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
an
agency
can
interpret
its
own
rules;
and
if
it
has
authority
to
make
the
rule,
it
could
decide
that
it
means
something
different.
why
not?
where
--
where
in
the
law
does
it
say
they
can't
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
at
the
board
--
isn't
there
realism
in
this?
when
you
read
what
the
board
later
said
in
--
in
these
reports,
you
would
say,
well,
this
is
what
the
board
now
thinks.
and
what
in
the
law
prevents
the
board,
which
is
in
charge
of
its
own
regulations,
from
telling
us
what
it
thinks,
if
it's
in
good
faith
and
isn't
making
up
some
kind
of
ex-post
rationalization?
that's
the
word
used,
you
know,
in
the
brief
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
"specific
interest
rate".
i
mean,
my
understanding
of
it
--
and
i'm
asking,
so
you
can
correct
me
if
that
isn't
so
--
is
there's
a
regulation,
regulation
z.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
staff
put
out
some
commentary
and
says,
here's
what
that
means,
among
other
things:
that
the
creditor
can
increase
the
rate
at
its
discretion,
and
you
have
to
give
notice.
you
have
to
give
notice,
but
you
have
to
give
some
more
notice
if
the
original
notice
does
not
include
specific
terms
for
an
increase.
then
they
give
an
example.
suppose
the
increase
could
occur
under
the
creditor's
contract
reservation
right
to
increase
the
periodic
rate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
little
obscure.
as
i
say
it,
i'm
not
sure
what
i'm
talking
about.
so
then,
later
on,
the
board
puts
out
another
--
not
called
official
staff
commentary,
but
they
say:
"we'll
tell
you
what
that
word
"specific
terms"
means.
"
it
means
when
they
didn't
say
anything
about
the
interest
rate,
or
they
didn't
say
when
in
fact
they
were
going
to
increase
the
interest
rate
from
x
to
y,
then
they
didn't
give
specific
notice.
but
they
did
give
specific
notice
if
they
told
you
when
it
would
increase,
by
default
--
when
you
default.
and
they
did
give
specific
notice
when
they
told
you
what
the
maximum
it
would
go
up
to
was,
like
8
percent
or
18
or
whatever
it
was.
okay?
so
that's
the
board's
interpretation
of
its
official
staff
commentary,
which
in
turn
is
an
interpretation
of
the
reg.
so
if
we
are
supposed
to
defer
to
their
interpretation
of
their
own
reg
--
i
mean,
my
goodness,
wouldn't
we
defer
like
double
to
their
own
interpretation
of
their
own
staff
commentary,
which
is
an
interpretation
of
a
reg
which
they
have
an
authority
to
issue
under
the
--
you
see
my
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that
would
be
an
argument
you
could
make.
you
could
say
that
--
that
their
interpretation
here
exceeds
their
authority
under
the
statute.
now,
of
course,
if
you
are
right
about
that,
all
this
stuff
goes
out
the
window.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
a
pretty
hard
argument
to
make
that
one,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
your
view,
that's
staff
commentary,
the
staff
thing
means?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
fail
to
say
in
your
original
notice
that
default
is
the
trigger,
then
you
would
have
to
give
another
notice?
