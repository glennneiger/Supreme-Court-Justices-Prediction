of
course
--
i
suppose,
having
done
it
twice
before,
we
could
in
this
case
apply
auer
without
explaining
why
it
is
that
auer
is
not
inconsistent
with
mead,
right?
we
did
it
twice
before;
we
could
do
it
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
absolutely.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
lot
more
trouble,
though.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waxman
you
refer
to
footnote
7
on
page
29
of
your
blue
brief?
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
of
the
petition,
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know,
we
don't
--
we
don't
do
that
with
congress.
when
a
later
congress
says
what
a
statute
enacted
by
an
earlier
congress
meant,
we
don't
--
we
don't
retroactively
say,
well,
that
must
be
what
it
meant.
are
there
other
examples
of
where
the
board
says
what
a
prior
rule
meant
that
we
deferred
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
have
to
be
disclosed,
just
the
increase
in
rate?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
reason
for
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
get
the
notice
with
your
next
statement.
but
you
are
talking
about
the
purchases
made
before
the
next
statement,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
get
notice
if
your
rates
changed.
it
would
show
it,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
to
figure
out?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
he
had
been
paying,
what,
10
percent
and
it's
now
25
percent,
it
would
seem
evident
on
the
face.
but
that
doesn't
solve
the
problem
of
the
purchases
that
you
have
made
before
you
got
that
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
rates
--
the
rates
that
may
be
charged--
justice
antonin
scalia
--hasn't
been
changed.
that
still
remains
what
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
no,
you're
the
one
that's
reading
it
to
say
something
different
from
what
it
says.
it
says
the
rates
that
may
be
charged.
that's
the
term,
"these
rates
may
be
charged".
that
term
hadn't
been
changed.
you
want
to
change
it
to
"the
rates
that
are
charged".
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
it's
at
least
a
horse
race,
and
that
brings
us
back
to
how
much
deference
you
give
to
the
--
to
the
board.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
trying
to
make
the
argument
that
it's
clear.
the
fact
that
it
says
"may
be
charged"
alone
makes
it
unclear,
it
seems
to
me.
