mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
during
the
relevant
time
period
the
federal
reserve
board's
regulation
z
did
not
require
provision
of
change-in-terms
notice
when
a
credit
card
issuer
merely
implemented
a
contractual
penalty
rate
provision
that
had
already
been
disclosed.
this
is
clear
from
staff
commentary
to
the
rule,
from
the
board's
own
statements
in
the
federal
register
when
discussing
changes
to
this
very
rule,
and
finally
from
the
amicus
briefs
filed
by
the
board
in
the
first
circuit
and
in
this
court.
i
think
it's
important
to
put
the
particular
regulatory
provisions
here
in
a
larger
context
because
the
policy
question
at
issue
here,
whether
there
should
be
advance
notice
under
these
circumstances,
is
not
new.
it
did
not
arise
with
this
litigation.
it
has
been
the
subject
of
intense
regulatory
focus
at
the
board
since
2004.
it
has
been
the
subject
of
two
rounds
of
notice
and
comment
rulemaking,
of
consumer
testing,
and
finally
of
an
amendment
to
the
rule
to
provide
notice
under
these
circumstances,
notice
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
view
had
always
been
required,
unbeknownst
to
the
board
or
anyone
in
the
regulatory
community.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
do.
this
is,
of
course,
not
a
chevron
case.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
truth
in
lending
act
that
deals
with
subsequent
disclosure.
the
subsequent
disclosure--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--it's
an
auer
case,
and
we
believe
that
all
of
these
provisions,
certainly
the
staff
commentary
deserves
deference,
and
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
milholland,
in
the
milholland
case.
but
also
the
board's
own
authoritative
statements
in
the
rulemaking
proceedings
about
what
its
old
rules
meant
certainly
deserve
deference,
and
we
believe
the
amicus
briefs
do
as
well.
in
2004
it
was--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
this
board
--
this
court,
of
course,
in
long
island
care
at
home
deferred
to
an
internal
advisory
memorandum
that
was
provided
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
was
at
issue.
that
was
an
after-the-fact
reading
and
it
was
a
change
in
policy.
in
the
context
of
auer
deference,
when
you
are
looking
to
the
author
of
the
agency's
regulation
to
elucidate
what
that
regulation
has
meant,
means,
the
court
has
looked
at
a
broad
range
of
material
because
it
understands
that
when
congress
delegates
rulemaking
authority
to
an
agency
that
it
also
as
an
adjunct
to
that
delegates
authority
to
interpret
those
rules.
so
in
2004
the
board
launched
a
proceeding
because
it
was
concerned
with
the
very
issue
that
underlies
this
litigation.
and
then
in
2007
it
issued
rules
to
address
this
situation.
and
in
that
rulemaking
notice,
and
this
is
at
page
12
of
the
blue
brief,
the
board
described
what
the
old
rules
required.
and
it
did
so
in
a
way
that
is
irreconcilable
with
the
court
of
appeals'
view
of
what
the
old
rules
required.
the
board
noted
that
staff
comment
9(c)(1)
did
not
require
provision
of
a
change
in
terms
notice
when
a
specific
change
had
been
previously
disclosed.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
under
the
old
rule,
no.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
under
the
old
rule,
no.
there
is
a
specific
staff
comment,
6(a)(2)-11,
which
deals
with
the
initial
disclosure
of
penalty
rate
provisions,
and
it
said
there
are
two
requirements
of
specificity.
the
specific
maximum
rate
that
may
be
applied
must
be
disclosed,
and
the
specific
event
or
events
that
could
lead
to
imposition
of
that
specific
maximum
rate
must
be
disclosed.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
yes.
under
staff
comment
9(c)(1),
the
staff
makes
clear
that
if
there
is
a
general
exercise
of
a
change
in
rates
pursuant
to
a
general
reservation
of
rights
clause
that
is
not
specific
with
respect
to
the
maximum
rate
that
could
apply
or
the
specific
triggering
event
that
could
lead
to
imposition
of
the
maximum
rate,
that
advance
notice
is
required.
but
the
staff
contrasted
that
to
the
situation
we
have
here,
when
the
specific
change
is
previously
disclosed,
and
it
provided
some
examples,
the
third
of
which
is
quite
analogous
here.
it's
a
situation
where
the
cardholder
has
agreed
to
maintain
a
certain
balance
in
a
savings
account
at
the
risk
of
having
his
rate
go
up
if
he
--
if
he
goes
below
that
balance.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
that
was
in
--
that's
been
there
since
1981,
justice
kennedy.
but
going
back
to
the
2007
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking,
the
court
specifically
--
sorry
--
the
board
specifically
addressed
this
situation.
it
said:
"some
credit
card
agreements
permit
the
card
issuer
to
increase
the
periodic
rate
if
the
consumer
makes
a
late
payment.
"
"because
the
circumstances
of
the
increase
are
specified
in
advance
in
the
account
agreement,
the
creditor
currently
need
not
provide
a
change
in
terms
notice.
"
"under
current
226.7(d),
the
new
rate
will
appear
on
the
periodic
statement
for
the
cycle
in
which
the
increase
occurs.
"
this
statement
by
the
board
authoritatively
interpreting
its
rule
is
inconsistent
with
the
court
of
appeals
view
of
those
rules.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
it's
a
retroactive
increase
without
notice
that
was
specifically
disclosed
initially.
so
if
you
look
to
the
cardholder
agreement
here
on
page
20a
of
the
petition
appendix,
chase
was
up
front
that
that's
what
would
happen,
that
the
change
would
be
--
the
increase
in
rates
would
be
applied
to
existing
balances;
and
that,
consistent
with
the
statement
from
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking,
that
the
consumer
would
find
out
about
that
when
he
received
his
next
periodic
statement.
that's
a
backward-looking
statement.
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
court
of
appeals'
view
that
advance
notice
had
always
been
required.
the
court
of
appeals
tried
to
dismiss
this
statement
and
others
like
it
as
incidental
descriptions
of
current
law.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
without
advance
notice.
there
are
actually
two
kinds
of
notice
under
the
old
rule.
now
there
are
three.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
right.
it
has
to
be
--
it
has
to
be
disclosed
initially.
it
had
to
be
disclosed
initially,
and
if
the
cardholder
didn't
like
the
terms
he
didn't
have
to
sign
up
for
that
card.
and
then
it
had
to
be
disclosed
subsequently
on
the
periodic
statement
immediately
following
the
rate
increase,
which
would
typically
be
within
a
matter
of
weeks.
now,
the
board
now
believes
that
there
should
be
a
third--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--the
new
rate,
right.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
not
the
reason.
under
the
new
rule,
a
general
reason
has
to
be
given.
so
when
the
court
of
appeals
described
this
as
an
incidental
description
of
current
law,
it
was
correct
that
this
is
a
description
of
current
law,
but
it
wasn't
at
all
incidental.
it
was
inherent
in
the
rulemaking
proceeding.
the
agency
needed
to
explain
what
its
old
rules
required
while
it
was
--
so
the
readers
could
make
sense
of
what
it
was
proposing
to
do
to
those
rules.
and
then,
as
mr.
waxman
said,
when
the
board
then
adopted
amendments
it
did
two
different
things.
it
changed
226.9(c),
the
provision
at
issue
here,
to
extend
the
notice
period
to
45
days.
but
then
it
did
something
additional.
it
adopted
a
new
subsection,
226.9(g),
to
provide
for
notice
in
situations
where
there
was
no
change
in
terms,
where,
by
contrast,
the
card
issuer
was
simply
implementing
terms
that
had
previously
been
disclosed.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
in
1981,
as
we
discussed
earlier,
there
was
no
provision
in
the
truth
in
lending
act
requiring
subsequent
disclosure
at
all.
and
the
focus
in
the
statute
at
that
time
and
in
the
board
at
that
time
was
on
the
importance
of
initial
disclosure.
and
it
was
thought
that
initial
disclosure
was
the
key
tool
that
consumers
could
use
to
comparison
shop
for
credit.
and
the
board
wasn't
as
focused
on
things
that
happened
later
in
that
credit
arrangement.
and
it
thought
that
the
initial
disclosure
and
the
subsequent
disclosure
was
sufficient,
in
the
same
way
that
in
a
variable
rate
plan
there
is
initial
disclosure
of
the
variable
rate
and
there
is
subsequent
disclosure
on
the
periodic
statement
after
the
rate
adjusts.
there
was
no
requirement
and
there
still
is
no
requirement
that
there
be
advanced
notice
when
a
variable
rate
increases.
the
consumer
find
out
about
it
on
the
periodic
statement
within
a
matter
of
weeks
of
the
rate
adjustment,
and
the
board
previously
viewed
these
penalty
rate
provisions
in
much
the
same
way.
the
board
has
now
come
to
a
different
judgment.
