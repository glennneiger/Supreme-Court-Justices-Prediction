mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
is
how
to
interpret
a
since-amended
version
of
regulation
z.
in
amicus
briefs
filed,
solicited
by
the
first
circuit
and
by
this
court,
the
federal
reserve
board
has
confirmed
that
it
has
long
interpreted
its
regulation
just
as
chase
bank
and
the
rest
of
the
regulated
credit
card
industry
understood.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
justice
kagan?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
a
lot
of
the
above.
first
of
all,
auer
has
been
applied
in
the
context
of
amicus
briefs
since
christensen
and
mead,
both
--
unanimously
both
in
kennedy
and
in
long
island
care
at
home.
and
i
must
say,
in
both
of
those
cases
the
deference
was
to
a
brief
that
acknowledged
a
change
in
the
agency's
position,
which
is
quite
unlike
what's
going
on
here.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
nonetheless,
i
think
those
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
auer
is
alive
and
well.
and
in
any
event,
as
your
question
pointed
out,
both
mead
and
christensen
and
the
passage
in
christensen
that
you
are
referring
to
dealt
with
the
question
of
chevron
deference
to
informal
letters
from
the
--
from,
you
know,
a
--
somebody
who
was
employed
by
an
administrative
agency.
and
the
question
in
the
case,
the
interpretive
question
in
the
case,
in
the
chevron
context,
is:
what
confidence
can
we
have
that
congress
has
in
fact
delegated
to
the
agency
interpretive
or
rulemaking
authority
in
this
context?
and
so,
for
example,
in
mead,
the
court
distinguished
between
notice
and
comment
regulations
that
customs
put
out,
as
opposed
to
the
kind
of
determinations
that
were
made
by
46
different
offices
at
the
rate
of
something
like
15,000
letters
a
year.
in
the
--
when
christensen
dealt
with
the
auer
question,
because
it
did
involve
a
--
an
informal
opinion
of
the
wage
and
hour
administrator
both
interpreting
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
regulation,
when
it
came
to
interpreting
the
regulation
what
this
court
said
is:
our
deference
doesn't
apply
here
because
we
read
the
regulation
as
clear.
and
auer,
of
course,
made
clear
that
deference
is
due
to
an
agency
brief
unless
it
is
plainly
erroneous
or
the
regulation
is
clear.
now,
here
we
have
a
situation
in
which
it
is
not
an
agency
staff
or
whatever
that
has
applied.
the
first
circuit
asked
the
government
for
--
solicited
the
federal
reserve
board
itself
to
explain
the
meaning
of
its
own
regulation.
and
the
brief
that
was
filed
represented
that
it
was
the
longstanding
and
consistent
interpretation
of
the
federal
reserve
board
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
correct.
we
think
that
the
federal
reserve
board's
reading
of
the
two
regulatory
provisions
is
the
better
reading,
but
we
acknowledge,
as
every
court
i
think
that
has
addressed
this,
that
there
is
some
ambiguity
just
looking
at
the
regulations.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
also
that
the
views
expressed
in
the
amicus
brief
solicited
by
the
first
circuit
and
by
this
court
are
entirely
consistent
with
explanations
that
the
board,
as
a
board,
provided
in
the
course
of
a
4-year
rulemaking
process
about
what
these
provisions
mean.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
--
i
think
that
if
it
weren't
for
the
amicus
briefs
in
this
case
which
are
later
in
time
and
address
the
very
specific
question
that
is
presented
in
this
case,
our
deference
would
be
appropriate.
and
it's
not
just
an
anpr.
there
was
the
federal
reserve
explanation
accompanying
the
anpr,
a
functionally
identical
explanation
accompanying
the
proposed
rule,
and
one
also
accompanying
the
final
rule.
and
those
explanations
of
the
board
are
entitled
to
auer
deference.
after
all,
in
anderson
ford,
another
case
involving
the
construction
of
regulation
z,
this
court
acknowledged
that
deference
was
due
to
a
proposed
--
the
commentary
accompanying
a
proposed
change
in
regulation
z
which
had
not
in
fact
even
been
implemented.
so--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
sorry?
judge--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
and
in
fact,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
say
that
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
below
referred
to
the
anpr
when
--
both
when
they
were
referring
to
the
commentary
to
the
anpr
and
the
commentary
to
the
actual
proposed
rule
in
2007.
now,
of
course
judge
cudahy
was
deciding
this
before
the
first
circuit
had
solicited
the
views.
on
rehearing,
we
urged
the
ninth
circuit
to
solicit
the
views
of
the
federal
reserve
board
if
there
were
any
doubt,
because
a
split
had
been
created,
but
it
declined
to
do
so.
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--sure.
or--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--or
you
could
--
you
could
explain
that
it
is
not
in
any
way
inconsistent
with
mead,
because
mead--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to
be
sure,
but
you
granted
plenary
review
in
this
case.
and
i
do,
i
just
want
to
underscore,
i'm
not
trying
to
--
i'm
not
trying
to
be
flip
here.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
inconsistency
between
auer
and
mead.
mead
involved
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
--
the
court
could
be
confident
that
congress
had
delegated
some
sort
of
law-making
function
to
these
letters
that
were
written
by
customs
officers
across
the
country
to
individual
importers,
when
the
letters
themselves
made
clear
that
they
couldn't
be
relied
on
by
anybody
other
than
that
particular
importer
and
only
unless
and
until
the
customs
officer
changed
her
mind.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
kagan,
with
respect
to
the
mead
question,
which
is
a
chevron
question,
the
board's
explanation
in
--
published
in
the
federal
register
in
2004,
and
again
in
2007,
and
again
in
2009,
is
a
formal
explication
of
the
board's
rules
pursuant
to
its
very,
very
broad
rulemaking
authority
under
the
truth
in
lending
act.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
given
my
chosen
line
of
work,
it
may
be
mete
for
me
not
to
inject
myself
into
this
debate.
[laughter]
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
giving
the
dissent
its
full
weight,
i
had
understood
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
to
explain
that
notice
--
the
existence
of
formal
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
is
an
important
indicator--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--one
indicator
of
congressional
delegation
of
rulemaking
authority.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
not
exclusive.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
right.
as
to
--
i
agree
with
that
and,
as
to
why
we
are
getting
into
all
this,
you
know,
i
had
a
prepared
statement
that
actually
was
going
off
in
a
different
direction.
[laughter]
not
in
the
sense
that
i
am
disagreeing
with
the
court,
but
the
point
that
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
correct.
and
i
think
to
the
extent
that
there's
anything
more
that's
needed,
it
seems
to
me
the
icing
on
the
cake
here
is
that
the
rulemaking
that
i
have
been
discussing
during
which
over
the
course
of
several
years
the
board
engaged
in
consumer
testing,
in
surveys,
in
comments,
and
decided
to
change
its
regulation
--
it
produced
as
what
it
called
a,
quote,
226.9,
that
establishes
as
a
new
requirement
what
the
respondent
in
this
case
erroneously
ascribes
to
the
previously
unamended
text.
and
that
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
correct
and
it's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
agree,
justice
sotomayor,
that
that
--
that
one
of
the
two
changes
that
the
board
made
could
be
characterized
and
was
in
fact
a
major
change.
but
if
the
court
will
take
note
of
the
pages,
the
federal
register
record
cites
that
we
provided
on
page
29,
note
7,
of
our
blue
brief,
and
that
the
federal
reserve
board's
amicus
brief
in
the
first
circuit
provided
at
page
12a
of
the
government's
brief,
i
think
you
will
see
that
the
board
--
the
board
in
2009
was
very
careful
to
explain,
as
it
did
in
2007,
that
it
was
making
in
this
respect
two
major
changes.
one
is
that
in
those
instances
in
which
the
contract
was
being
changed,
that
is
a
term
of
the
contract
was
being
changed,
advance
notice
of
45
days
would
be
required
regardless
of
what
kind
of
change
it
was,
but
that
when
there
was
a
--
an
rate
increase,
quote,
"due
to
delinquency,
deficiency,
or
penalty,
not
due
to
a
change
in
contractual
terms
in
consumer's
account.
"
reference
should
be
made
to
new
subsection
(g).
and
the
federal
reserve
board
was
very,
very
clear
that
it
was
making
two
different
changes:
one
to
extend
the
advanced
notice
period
with
respect
to
changes
in
terms
from
what
the
original
disclosure
provided;
and
another
to
provide
that
if
you
are
increasing
the
rate,
even
if
it
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
initial
disclosures,
you
are
required
by
this
new
subsection
to
provide
advance
notice.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
now,
of
course,
we
are
talking
about
a
rule
that
--
it
had
been
amended
2
years
ago,
but
under
the
old
regime
the
cardholder
was
on
notice.
i
mean
there
had
to
be
--
and
the
reg
z
commentary
was
clear
that
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
default
rate
it
had
to
specify
in
the
initial
disclosures
both
the
precise
triggering
event,
that
is,
what
constitutes
a
default
--
and
here
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
specified
that
what
constitutes
a
default
is
a
default
or
failure
to
make
a
payment
to
any
creditor
--
and
there
also
has
to
be
a
specification
of
the
maximum
rate
that
could
be
applied
as
a
result.
now,
in
this
case,
as
the
board
explained,
the
consumer
would
be
notified
in
the
next
monthly
statement
--
and
it
is
pretty
prominent
--
that
the
interest
rate
applied
to
all
balances
for
that
month
was
as
follows.
may
i
save
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh,
gosh,
i
hope
i
have
this
right.
oh,
no.
i'm
sorry,
it's
footnote
7
on
page
29
of
our
petition.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
may
it
please
the
court:
just
three
small
points.
my
interest
was
peaked
when
justice
breyer
said
that
he
acknowledged
that
he
may
have
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about
with
respect
to
a
reservation
of
rights.
and
i
just
want
to
be
clear
that
reservation
of
rights
clauses,
which
are
also
referred
to
as
change
in
terms
clauses,
are
ubiquitous
in
these
contracts
and
initial
disclosures,
they
are
a
term
of
art
as
the
board
has
recognized.
and
what
they
are
is
simply
a
statement
by
the
credit
card
issuer
in
a
consumer
open
credit
account
arrangement
that,
you
know,
it
may
decide
to
change
any
term
in
any
respect
at
any
time
and
the
board's
regulations
make
clear
that
if
you
do
that,
that
is
if
you
implement
a
change
in
terms
pursuant
to
a
reservation
of
rights
clause,
you
have
to
provide
notice.
now,
the
specific
--
what
1998
amendment
to
regulation
z,
which
is
comment
6(a)(2)-11,
which
is
reprinted
in
relevant
part
on
page
a
of
our
blue
brief.
this
really
is
in
our
blue
brief.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
page
8.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
right.
you
have
to
--
i
mean,
what
it
says,
and
i'm
quoting
from
4/5
of
the
way
down
page
8.
"if
the
initial
rate
may
increase
upon
the
occurrence
of
one
or
more
specific
events
such
as
a
late
payment
or
an
extension
of
credit
that
exceeds
the
credit
limit,
the
creditor
must
disclose
the
initial
rate
and
the
increased
penalty
rate
that
may
apply.
"
and
this
was
an
amendment
in
1998
that
the
board
made
to
reg
z
in
what
it
recognized,
what
it
stated
was
on
account
of
the
increased
use
of
default
penalty
terms
in
the
initial
disclosures,
that
it
wanted
to
make
clear
that
if
both
the
triggering
event
and
the
maximum
rate
was
specified
there
would
be
no
change
in
terms
if
an
increased
rate
were
implemented.
and
finally,
i
just
want
to
address
my
friend's
point
that
there
may
be
some
question
about
whether
tila
even
authorizes
the
board's
explanation
of
the
type
of
subsequent
disclosure
that
was
or
wasn't
required
and
underscore
mr.
palmore's
observation
that
in
tila
until
2009
there
was
a
requirement
for
initial
disclosures,
there
was
a
requirement
for
periodic
statements,
but
nothing
at
all
about
subsequent
disclosures.
