justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
how
the
contract
works?
in
the
situation
in
which
a
cardholder
is
found
by
--
was
found
by
chase
to
have
defaulted
by
failing
to
make
some
payment
other
than
payment
on
the
chase
credit
card,
so
you
determine,
i
guess
from
information
obtained
from
a
credit
agency,
that
the
cardholder
has
failed
to
make
payments
to
someone
else
on
time,
you
conclude
that
the
cardholder
is
in
default,
you
increase
the
interest
rate.
how
is
the
--
the
cardholder,
knowing,
thinking
that
he
or
she
has
made
all
chase
payment
on
time
is,
not
going
to
be
alerted
to
the
fact
that
there
may
be
an
increase
in
the
rate.
so
how
is
that
cardholder
going
to
realize
what
has
happened,
just
by
scrutinizing
the
monthly
statement
and
seeing
that
the
little
interest
figure
is
different
from
what
it
was
the
last
time?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
did
the
board
think
that
requiring
the
card-issuing
company
to
provide
immediate
notice
would
be
very
burdensome?
and
if
not,
what
--
what
was
its
reason
for
interpreting
the
regulation
z
the
way
it
did?
