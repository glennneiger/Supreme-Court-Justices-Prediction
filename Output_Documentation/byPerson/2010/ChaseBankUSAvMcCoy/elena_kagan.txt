mr.
waxman?
justice
elena
kagan
can
i
ask
you
about
the
deference
that
we
should
give
to
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
the
first
circuit
and
the
invitation
brief
in
this
case?
auer
deference
seems
pretty
four-square
with
this.
it's
a
brief
that
was
filed
to
interpret
an
agency
regulation.
but
i'm
wondering
whether
auer
continues
to
remain
good
law
after
christensen
and
mead.
in
christensen
the
court
held,
and
i
quote,
"interpretations
such
as
those
in
opinion
letters,
like
interpretations
contained
in
policy
statements,
agency
manuals,
and
enforcement
guidelines,
all
of
which
lack
the
force
of
law,
do
not
warrant
chevron-style
deference.
"
and
mead
said
pretty
much
the
same
thing.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
three
possibilities
for
why
auer
remains
good
law.
one
is
that
briefs
are
somehow
different
from
all
those
other
things
that
we
talked
about
in
christensen.
another
is
that
an
agency
gets
more
deference
when
interpreting
regulations
than
when
interpreting
its
own
statutes
--
something
that
i
think
i
just
don't
quite
understand,
but
maybe
you
could
convince
me
of
it.
and
a
third
is,
well,
look,
they
are
just
basically
inconsistent,
but
auer
was
auer
and
we
don't
feel
like
overruling
cases,
and
we're
not
so
sure
we
got
it
right
in
christensen
and
mead
anyway.
so
which
is
it?
justice
elena
kagan
absolutely
right,
mr.
waxman,
but
in
each
of
those
cases
it
was
basically
a
sentence
or
two.
we
never
really
addressed
the
possible
conflict
between
auer
and
christensen
and
mead.
justice
elena
kagan
but
mead
did
put
a
lot
of
emphasis
on
procedural
formality.
so,
you
know,
justice
scalia
sort
of
snidely,
but
i
think
accurately,
described
mead
as
saying:
"only
when
agencies
act
through
adjudication,
notice
and
comment
rulemaking,
or
some
other
procedure
indicating
comparable
congressional
intent,
whatever
that
means,
is
chevron
deference
applicable.
"
so--
justice
elena
kagan
--this
is
not
an
adjudication.
it's
not
a
notice
and
comment
rulemaking,
and
it's
hard
to
see
why
there
is
some
procedure
here
indicating
comparable
congressional
intent,
as
mead
would
require.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
palmore,
what
would
the
board's
position
be
on
the
following
hypothetical:
that
a
card
issuer
says
when
any
of
50
different
things
happen,
so
50
different
triggering
events,
the
issuer
can
raise
the
rate
to
--
anywhere
up
to
300
percent,
so
has
complete
discretion
if
any
of
a
quite
large
number
of
triggering
events
occurs.
and
then
one
of
those
50
triggering
events
occurs,
and
the
card
issuer
says,
okay,
we
will
raise
the
interest
rate
to
42
percent.
would
there
need
to
be
notice
for
that?
justice
elena
kagan
under
the
old
rule?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
beck,
just
to
clarify
your
position,
if
the
initial
agreement
said
your
rate
is
10
percent,
but
if
you
are
delinquent,
your
rate
will
be
20
percent,
so
not
up
to
20
percent,
just
20
percent,
it's
an
automatic
increase
in
your
rate
--
in
that
case,
would
notice
--
would
subsequent
notice
be
required?
justice
elena
kagan
so
if
you
don't
need
to
disclose
this,
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
import
of
justice
ginsburg's
question--
justice
elena
kagan
--what's
the
difference
between
going,
okay,
we
will
do
the
initial
agreement,
10
percent
to
20
percent;
then
we
can
always
lower
the
rate
without
providing
notice;
we
will
go
back
down
to
12
percent,
and
now
you
have
a
12
percent
rate.
what's
the
difference
between
doing
that
and
on
the
other
hand
doing
what
the
card
issuer
said
here,
which
is
if
you
are
delinquent,
we
have
the
discretion
to
go
up
to
20
percent,
but
you
know,
we
could
also
go
to
12?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
bauer,
most
of
your
argument
seems
to
rely
on
the
official
staff
commentary,
but
the
official
staff
commentary
itself
seems
to
me
to
cut
against
you.
it
says
no
notice
need
be
given
if
the
specific
change
is
set
forth
initially.
and
then
it
gives
examples
of
what
that
means.
and
it
says
such
as,
an
increase
that
occurs
when
the
consumer
has
been
under
an
agreement
to
maintain
a
certain
balance
in
a
savings
account
in
order
to
keep
a
particular
rate
and
the
account
balance
falls
below
the
specified
minimum.
so
the
example
they
give
is
an
example
where
there
is
a
triggering
event
and
there
is
a
penalty
rate
that
comes
into
effect
as
a
result
of
the
triggering
event.
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
true
here.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
on
the
triggering
event
first.
it's
true
that
you
might
know
your
account
balance,
but
it's
also
true
that
you
might
know
whether
you
paid
your
bills
on
time.
what's
the
difference?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
don't
see
that
in
the
example
that's
given.
i
don't
see
that
it
limits
it
to
a
situation
in
which
there
is
an
automatic
increase
in
your
rate
rather
than
a
discretionary
increase
in
your
rate.
