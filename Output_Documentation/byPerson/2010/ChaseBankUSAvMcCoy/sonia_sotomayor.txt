so
you
think
the
same
deference
is
owed
to
anpr's
as
to
the
amicus
briefs?
what
is
your
position
on
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
do
think
--
i
do
think,
counsel,
that
that
major
change
doesn't
have
to
be
the
way
you
describe
it.
the
difference
between
either
contemporary
notice
and/or
15-day
notice
versus
45
is
a
significant
change.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
it
doesn't
need
to
have
been
precipitated
solely
by
a
decision
that
the
old
rule,
if
it's
as
your
adversary
advocates
it,
didn't
exist.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
left
of
their
arguments
if
we
decide
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
the
official
staff
commentary
is
ambiguous?
what
is
left?
is
auer
deference
then
required?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
to
the
amicus
brief
at
least?
we
can
talk
about
whether
the
anprs
or
the
unofficial
commentaries
are
due
deference.
but
what
are
we
left
with
if
we
think
there
is
ambiguity?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
your
case
rises
and
falls
on
whether
we
believe
that
the
statute
is
clear?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
different
question.
you
are
claiming
that
the
board's
regulation
supersede
whatever
deference
auer
would
otherwise
give
to
amicus
briefs?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
regulation
z,
promulgated
by
the
federal
reserve
board
pursuant
to
its
authority
under
the
truth
in
lending
act,
requires
issuers
of
credit
cards
to
disclose
certain
information
to
cardholders.
the
version
of
regulation
z,
applicable
in
this
case,
requires
that
insurers
provide
cardholders
with
an
“initial
disclosure
statement”,
specifying
“each
periodic
rate”
associated
with
the
account.
the
regulation
also
imposes
“subsequent
disclosure
requirements”
including
giving
to
cardholders
notice
when
any
term
required
to
be
initially
disclosed
is
changed.
the
cardholder
agreement
between
petitioner,
chase
bank
and
respondent
james
mccoy,
authorized
chase
to
raise
mccoy's
interest
rate
up
to
a
preset
maximum,
in
the
event
that
mccoy
was
delinquent
or
in
default.
this
case
presents
the
question,
whether
regulation
z
required
chase
to
notify
mccoy
of
an
increase
it
imposed
within
the
range
specified
in
the
agreement
following
such
delinquency
or
default.
we
conclude
that
it
did
not.
we
find
that
the
text
of
regulation
z
is
ambiguous
with
respect
to
the
key
question,
whether
an
interest
rate
increase
instituted
pursue
--
pursuant
to
a
previously
disclosed
contractual
provision
is
a
change
in
term
requiring
notice.
because
the
regular
--
regulatory
text
is
unclear,
we
look
to
the
board's
own
interpretation
of
the
regulation
for
guidance.
under
our
precedent
in
auer
versus
robbins,
we
deferred
to
an
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
regulations
advanced
in
a
legal
brief,
unless
that
interpretation
is
plainly
erroneous
or
inconsistent
with
the
regulation.
in
its
amicus
brief
to
this
court,
the
board
states
that
in
its
view,
the
version
of
regulation
z,
applicable
in
this
case,
does
not
require
notice.
the
interest
rate
increase
at
issue
did
not
change
the
term
of
the
agreement.
it's
simply
implemented
a
term
previously
disclosed.
this
interpretation
is
neither
plainly
erroneous
nor
inconsistent
with
the
regulation,
and
we
have
no
reason
to
suspect
that
it
does
not
reflect
the
board's
fair
and
considered
judgment
on
the
matter.
accordingly,
this
interpretation
is
authoritative
under
auer
and
we
need
look
no
further.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed.
