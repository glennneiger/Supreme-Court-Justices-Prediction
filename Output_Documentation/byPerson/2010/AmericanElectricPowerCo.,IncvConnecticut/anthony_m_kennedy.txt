justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
--
if
you
had
a
state
court
suit
with
a
state
plaintiff,
wouldn't
the
state
be
able
to
adduce
federal
common
law
as
a
ground
for
recovery?
and
then
we
would
get
to
the
merits
and
see
if
there
is
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
all
--
we
all
know
that
you
sometimes
have
to
peek
at
the
merits
to
see
if
there's
standing.
there's
a
little
cheating
that
goes
on.
but
--
but
in
this
case
it
does
seem
to
me
that
you're
lacking
any
clear
precedent.
when
i
think
of
standing,
i
think
of
frothingham
v.
mellon.
that
isn't
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
more
receptive
to
this
kind
of
argument
if
i
know
we're
going
to
the
merits
as
opposed
to
standing--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
recognize
that
we
slip
in
and
out
of
the
two
categories,
and
don't
want
to
make
it
difficult
on
you.
but
i
take
it
that
these
arguments
also
go
to
whether
there's
a
cause
of
action
on
the
merits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
part
of
the
inquiry,
part
of
the
dynamic,
how
imminent
the
federal
regulation
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
again,
that
just
goes
to
the
merits.
you
make
that
argument
to
the
district
court
that
your
injunction
is
meaningless,
equity
does
not
require
an
idle
act.
end
of
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'll
think
about
it,
but
newdow
was
a
case
where
we
thought
that
this
particular
litigant
was
not
directly
injured.
here
the
state
said
it's
directly
injured.
that's
the
distinction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
same
--
same
hypothetical,
assume
no
federal
statute,
and
--
and
assume
no
federal
common
law.
what
about
state
law?
does
state
common
law
become
displaced
because
it's
a
matter
of
federal
concern?
we
don't
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
usually
have
preemption
of
federal
common
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
hypothetical
is
that
the
federal
law
--
federal
statutory
law
doesn't
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
be
very
odd
to
say
that
there's
no
federal
common
law,
but
also
that
there's
no
--
no
displacement
of
state
law.
that
--
that
seems
to
me
odd.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
can
concede
that,
but
we
still
have
the
displacement
argument--
