justice

scalia
mr.
keisler,
what
--
what
good
does
it
do
you
to
have
this
court
say
that
there
is
no
article
iii
standing?
the
suit
will
just
be
brought
in
state
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
state
common
law
and
--
and
the
states'
rules
of
standing
are
not
ours.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
only
need
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
sure
about
that,
are
we?
so
we
--
we
--
we
--
may
be
just
spinning
our
wheels
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
you
know,
tapping
the
case
to
state
judges
instead
of
federal
judges,
i
would
frankly
rather
have
federal
judges
do
it,
probably.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
epa
is
given
authority
to
regulate
other
pollutants,
including
those
that
do
not
go
up
into
the
atmosphere,
but
that
does
not
prevent
california,
for
example,
from
enacting
stricter
standards
for
its
--
for
automobiles
in
its
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
should
we
say
the
epa
preempts
the
federal
common
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
best
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
merits
argument,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you're
going
to
have
to
struggle
with
the
preemption
question
sooner
or
later.
you're
confident
you
can
establish
not
only
displacement
of
federal
common
law,
but
also
preemption
of
state
common
law,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
add
a
third
thing
that
it
goes
to
and
that's
article
iii
standing.
it's
clear
in
our
cases,
if
as
you
say
the
relief
requested
here
will
not
remedy
the
complaint
of
these
people,
you
don't
have
to
go
to
prudential
standing.
that
it
seems
to
me
would
deny
article
iii
standing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
you
assert
that
the
remedy
here
will
not
provide
the
relief
--
you
acknowledge
that,
don't
you,
that
the
remedy
here
cannot
possibly
stop
global
warming,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does?
in
massachusetts
v.
epa
the
relief
was
allowing
a
federal
agency
to
regulate
the
entire
society's
carbon
emissions.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
was
the
holding
of
massachusetts
v.
epa,
that
epa
can
only
regulate
the
transportation
section?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
holding
of
the
case
and
--
and
do
you
think
the
--
the
--
the
forthcoming
epa
rules
can
only
govern
transportation?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
not.
of
course
the
case
covers--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
the
epa
could
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
think
that
they
have
to
have
in
mind
state
law
for
preemption,
either.
if
indeed
the
state
law
just
positively
conflicts
with
a
federal
statute,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
congress
had
state
law
in
mind,
does
it?
i
don't
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
haven't
told
us
how.
it
--
it
--
it's
certainly
not
harder
to
find
because
for
preemption
you
require
congressional
intent,
whereas
here
--
whereas
for
displacement
you
don't.
that's
not
the
--
that's
not
the
difference.
what
--
what
is
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
--
you're
lumping
them
all
together.
suppose
you
lump
together
all
the
cows
in
the
country.
would
--
would
that
allow
you
to
sue
all
those
farmers?
i
mean,
don't
you
have
to
do
it
defendant
by
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
cow
by
cow,
or
at
least
farm
by
farm?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can
lump
everybody
together,
so
you
can
lump
together
all
the
people
in
the
united
states--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
breathe,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
all
--
all
homes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
homes
that
--
that
emit
carbon
dioxide
in
their
--
in
their
heating
systems.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
whole
country,
and
you
lump
them
all
together,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
that,
you
know,
that
equals
10
percent
or
whatever.
does
that
give
you
a
basis?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
don't
give
us
a
10
percent
figure.
justice
antonin
scalia
give
us
the,
you
know,
the
maximum
figure
for
a
single
one
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
implausible
--
implausible
is
the
word
you're
looking
for.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wish
justice
breyer
had
made
this
argument
in
the
epa
case.
i
don't
think
the
epa
case--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
epa
comes
up
with
a
different
number?
would
it
--
than
the
one
you
achieve
in
this
litigation;
would
the
epa
prevail?
would
the
epa's
number
prevail
or
your
number
prevail?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
yes.
i
mean
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
will
displace
the
judgment
that
has
been
obtained
under
federal
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and
the
court
says
no?
