mr.
peter
d.
keisler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
courts
are
being
asked
to
perform
a
legislative
and
regulatory
function
in
a
matter
in
which
the
necessary
balancing
of
contending
policy
interests
is
among
the
most
complex,
multifaceted,
and
consequential
of
any
policy
issue
now
before
the
country.
the
states
ask
that
the
courts
assess
liability
and
design
a
new
common
law
remedy
for
contributing
to
climate
change,
and
to
do
so
by
applying
a
general
standard
of
reasonableness
to
determine
for
each
defendant,
in
this
case
and
in
future
cases,
what,
if
any,
its
share
of
global
reductions
in
greenhouse
gas
emissions
ought
to
be.
that
would
require
the
courts
not
to
interpret
and
enforce
the
policy
choices
placed
into
law
by
the
other
branches,
but
to
make
those
policy
choices
themselves.
and
all
of
our
arguments
here
--
that
plaintiffs
lack
standing,
that
the
federal
common
law
shouldn't
be
expanded
to
include
this
new
cause
of
action,
and
that
the
case
presents
nonjusticiable
political
questions
--
while
all
of
them
represent
distinct
points,
all
of
them
flow
from
the
same
basic
separation
of
powers
principles
that
establish,
we
believe,
that
the
case
ought
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
now,
all
of
these
issues--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--well--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--mr.
chief
justice,
our
principal
argument
has
not
been
prudential
standing.
the
government
has
focused
on
the
prudential
standing
argument.
we
join
that
and
we'd
be
happy
to
see
the
case
resolved
on
that
basis,
but
our
principal
argument
on
standing
has
been
article
iii
standing.
and
we
actually
believe
that
the
court
could
resolve
this
case
and
address
the
issues
in
any
order,
with
one
possible
exception,
which
is
that
we
do
read
the
court's
decision
in
steel
co.
as
holding
that
the
court
has
to
address
article
iii
standing
before
reaching
the
question
whether
there's
a
valid
cause
of
action.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
well--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--well,
many
states,
your
honor,
have
similar
doctrines
of
standing,
similar
doctrines
of
political
questions.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
well,
in
any
event,
your
honor,
we
believe
we
would
have
a
very
strong
motion
to
dismiss
in
state
court
on
a
variety
of
grounds,
including--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--well,
i
don't--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--well,
as
i
said,
your
honor,
i
think
we
would
be
able
to
defeat
a
state
common
law
claim
on
grounds
of
state
law,
for
lack
of
proximate
cause,
on
standing
and
political
question
grounds
that
many
states
have
that
parallel
these;
but
in
any
case,
whichever
ground
the
court
resolves
this
case
on,
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
cause
of
action
can
proceed.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
it's
--
it's
possible,
your
honor,
although
we
think
they
would
be
more
likely
to
proceed
under
state
common
law.
but
either
way,
we
don't
think
the
elements
of
a
state
or
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
under
nuisance
could
be
met
here,
and
we're
very
confident
we
could
defeat
that
claim
in
state
court
as
well.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
but
the
court
has
said
in
warth
v.
seldin
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
demonstrate
that
it
will
benefit
in
some
tangible
way
from
the
court's
intervention.
and
that's--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--justice
ginsburg,
we
believe
that
massachusetts
was
very
carefully
qualified
to
focus
on
the
particular
regulatory
context
of
that
opinion.
the
court
said
that
it
was
addressing
standing
to
challenge
the
denial
of
a
petition
for
rulemaking,
when
the
agency
would
be
proceeding
incrementally
to
address
a
broader
problem,
and
a
statute
specifically
gave
the
petitioners
the
right
to
seek
that
kind
of
incremental
protection.
the
court
was
very
specific
about
that.
the
statutory
right
was
of
critical
importance,
it
said,
to
the
standing
inquiry.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
but
it
does,
justice
kagan,
specifically
refer
to
the
regulatory
context
in
which
the
case
is
taking
place.
the
court
said
that
if
the
epa's
arguments
there
about
traceability
and
redressability
were
adopted,
it
would
doom
most
challenges
to
agency
action
because
agencies
proceed
incrementally.
here
we
have
no
statute,
we
have
no
agency
proceeding
incrementally,
and
we
believe
there
is
no
basis
for
the
plaintiffs
to
seek
that
kind
of
incremental
relief
when
they've
acknowledged
that
will
have
no
material
effect
on
their
injury;
and
they
acknowledged
that
in
the
state's
complaint
when
they
specifically
said
that
the
relief
they
seek
here
would
only
constitute
these
defendants'
share
of
the
larger
overall
emissions
reductions
that
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
have
any
material
effect
on
climate
change
or
the
injuries
that
they
assert.
that
is
an
acknowledgment
that
the
relief
they
seek
here
would
not
provide
them
any
redress
except
in
connection
with
other
reductions
that
would
be
obtained
elsewhere,
and
that
we
think
means
that
this
is
a
classic
case
in
which
the
injuries
are
not
the
product
of
the
defendants'
conduct
but
of
the
collective
independent
actions
of
numerous
third
parties
not
before
the
court.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
but
there,
your
honor,
they
were
suing
a
defendant,
the
epa,
that
had
regulatory
authority
over
the
entire
country.
here
they're
suing
five
separate
defendants,
each
of
whom
has
to
be
evaluated
individually,
and
there
is
not
a
single
one
of
them
against
whom
the
relief
sought
would
have
any
tangible
effect
on
the
injuries
that
the
plaintiffs
claim
here.
but
we
also
think
that
massachusetts
is
relevant
in
a
completely
different
respect,
which
is
the
court
was
very
specific
in
massachusetts
about
what
its
role
was
and
what
it
wasn't.
the
court
said:
we
lack
the
expertise
or
the
authority
to
second-guess
the
policy
choices
of
the
epa,
but
its
role
there
was
to
compel
the
agency
to
adhere
to
the
statute
as
the
court
interpreted
it.
in
this
case,
the
states
are
asking
the
courts
to
play
exactly
the
role
that
this
court
disclaimed
in
massachusetts
v.
epa,
which
is
to
make
those
policy
choices
in
the
first
instance,
and
they
say
that
the
courts
can
do
this
because
the
courts
have
done
this
in
prior
nuisance
cases,
but
this
case
is
nothing
like
any
of
the
prior
nuisance
cases
this
court
has
held.
it's
nothing
like
an
instance
in
which
one
state
is
complaining
that
another
state
has
dumped
sewage
into
a
body
of
water
that's
crossed
the
border.
the
case--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--it's
not
a
question
of
the
quantity
of
plaintiffs,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
the
nature
of
the
task
that
the
court
would
have
to
perform,
and
this
task
is
different
because
of
the
global
nature
of
the
phenomenon.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
it
--
it--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--exactly,
your
honor,
and
whether
the
court
should
expand
the
federal
common
law
to
recognize
this.
the
global
nature
of
this
phenomenon
makes
it
different
because
every
sector
of
the
economy
worldwide
produces
greenhouse
gases,
and
there
is
no
geographic
nexus,
as
there
was
in
tennessee
copper
and
every
one
of
the
other
nuisance
cases,
between
the
source
of
the
emission
and
the
victim
that
claims
the
harm.
and
that
changes
what
the
court
has
to
do.
it
means
that
any
court
or
policymaker
thinking
about
how
to
alleviate
the
kinds
of
injuries
that
are
pled
here
has
to
first
think
what
is
the
appropriate
overall
level
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
the
atmosphere
and
then
make
a
comparative
judgment
about
how
the
reductions
that
would
be
necessary
to
achieve
that
level
should
be
allocated
among
all
the
different
sectors
based
on
the
social
good
that
that
sector
produces
and
what
reductions
would
mean
to
that
social
good.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
we
are
making
both
arguments,
justice
ginsburg.
we
don't
think
there
would
be
an
appropriate
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
even
if
the
clean
air
act
hadn't
been
enacted.
but
certainly
the
argument
is
even
stronger
and
easier
because
of
the
existence
of
the
clean
air
act
and
in
particular
because
this
court
in
massachusetts
v.
epa
interpreted
the
clean
air
act
so
that
the
term
epa
the
task
of
making
precisely
the
determinations
that
plaintiffs
ask
the
courts
to
make
here:
do
greenhouse
gases
endanger
the
public,
and
if
so,
what
regulatory
consequence--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--oh,
and--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--because
this
issue,
and
i
would
prefer
to
refer
to
it
as
displacement
rather
than
preemption,
is
very
different
from
the
question
of
preemption
of
state
law.
the
clean
air
act
has
a
savings
clause
that
preserves
state
authority
across
a
variety
of
areas,
but
the
court
in
second
milwaukee
v.
illinois
cases
specifically
distinguished
between
preemption
of
state
law
and
displacement
of
federal
common
law.
it
said
the
--
the
presumption
is
against
preemption
of
state
law
because
of
various
concepts
of
state
sovereignty,
but
because
of
federal
concepts
of
separation
of
powers,
the
presumption
is
in
favor
of
lawmaking
by
congress
and
not
lawmaking
by
courts,
and
that
means
that
the
standard
is
very
different.
it
means
that
if
congress
has
addressed
the
problem,
then
federal
common
law
is
displaced.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
milwaukee
v
illinois
ii.
that
was
the
case
in
which
the
court
held
that
the
clean
water
act
displaced
a
federal
common
law
nuisance
claim
by
illinois
against
milwaukee
and
specifically
said
because
congress
had
addressed
the
problem,
federal
common
law
had
no
role
to
play.
here
congress
has
established
a
process
and
it's
a
process
in
which
the
states
and
the
private
parties
here
can
participate.
they
can
file
petitions
for
rulemaking,
they
can
appeal
epa
decisions
that
they
oppose,
and
it
would
be
completely
inconsistent
with
that
process
if
they
could
also
take
a
complete
end
run
around
it
and
go
to
court
and
ask
courts
to
make
the
decisions
that
congress
has
assigned
to
epa.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
yes,
it
is
a
merits
argument,
because
it
says
that
any
federal
common
law
action
would
be
displaced
by
the
clean
air
act.
now,
the--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--i
don't
think
there
is
very
much
left
of
any
federal
common
law
of
interstate
pollution
claims,
just
because
the
field
has
been
so
heavily
occupied
by
statutes.
you
know,
all
the
nuisance
cases
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on,
your
honor,
they
were
in
a
completely
different
time.
they
were
at
a
time
when
the
court's
view
of
its
common
law
authority
was
extremely
broad
and
its
view
of
congress's
constitutional
power
under
the
commerce
clause
was
very
narrow.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
it
will
ultimately
depend
on
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
that
such
a
hypothetical
case
is
filed,
but
we
would
welcome
the
opportunity,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
the
question
is
always
what
congress
has
done,
not
what
the
stage
of
the
epa
rulemaking
process
is.
congress,
not
epa,
can
create
or
modify
or
destroy
causes
of
action,
and
that's
why
the
court
said
in
that
milwaukee
2
case
that
when
congress
has
addressed
the
problem
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
and
there
is
no
question
that
congress
has
addressed
not
simply
the
general
problem,
but
the
specific
problem
here.
it
has
the
statute
which
assigns
epa
the
authority
to
regulate
pollutants
in
certain
ways
and
pollutants
have
been
defined
under
massachusetts
v.
epa
to
include
the
precise
greenhouse
gasses
that
are
at
issue
here.
there
couldn't
be
a
more
specific
example
of
congress
having
addressed
the
problem
and
assigned
a
different
approach
to
dealing
with
it
than
letting
the
courts
work
it
out
under
federal
common
law.
the
states'
and
the
private
plaintiffs'
argument
is
that
the
federal
common
law
will
only
be
displaced
when
epa
adopts
the
precise
regulation
that
provides
the
precise
form
of
relief
that
they're
asking
for.
there's
no
case
that
says
that
and
that's
not
the
law.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
we
believe
that
the
epa
can
consider,
as
it's
undertaking
to
do,
regulating
existing
nonmodified
sources
under
section
111
of
the
clean
air
act,
and
that's
the
process
that's
engaged
in
now.
it's
announced
that
it
will
propose
standards
in
the
summer
and
complete
a
rulemaking
by
may.
obviously,
at
the
close
of
that
process
there
could
be
apa
challenges
on
a
variety
of
grounds,
but
we
do
believe
that
they
have
the
authority
to
consider
standards
under
section
111.
and
if
the
court
has
no
questions,
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
points.
first,
with
respect
to
the
merits
and
what
it
would
involve
to
adjudicate
this
case,
justice
kagan,
it
is
a
--
there's
a
reason
that
this
issue
is
so
fraught
and
difficult
in
international
negotiations
and
at
the
epa
and
in
the
halls
of
congress,
and
that's
because
it
requires
policymakers
to
allocate
burdens
among
critical
social
goods
in
favor
of
important
environmental
considerations;
and
the
remedies
that
are
being
considered
are
potentially
transformative
because
they
involve
the
way
we
use
and
supply
and
pay
for
energy.
and
the
problems
with
courts
attempting
to
replicate
what's
going
on
in
those
venues
are
not
simply
the
matter
is
complex,
although
of
course
it's
extremely
complex,
but
there
is
no
legal
principle
here
to
guide
the
decision.
it's
a
question
of
trade-offs,
how
the
country
wants
to
balance
the
projected
environmental
risks
and
benefits
against
the
projected
economic
benefits
and
costs.
if
congress
enacts
a
statute
providing
a
standard,
then
our
political
question
argument
goes
away.
it's
not
that
this
is
permanently
off
limits
to
the
judiciary.
it's
that
it
requires
a
standard.
and
in
a
big
intractable
issue
like
this,
congress
can
often
create
an
orderly
framework
for
consideration
within
a
statutory
context,
which
it
has
done
in
part
by
enacting
the
clean
air
act.
and
the
final
point
i
would
make
my
friend
and
i
come
at
this
really
from
opposite
angles,
in
the
following
sense,
which
is
the
plaintiffs
say
that
this
is
a
deeply
historically
rooted
cause
of
action
with
a
very
strong
and
ancient
pedigree,
and
therefore
it
can't
possibly
present
justiciability
problems,
under
standing,
political
question
doctrines;
and
we
say
that
the
very
powerful
standing
and
political
question
obstacles
that
we
think
are
apparent
on
the
face
of
this
are
a
signal
that
this
is
nothing
like
the
historical
cause
of
action
that
they've
relied
on.
to
classify
climate
change
as
a
tort
would
trigger
a
massive
shift
of
institutional
authority
away
from
the
politically
accountable
branches
and
to
the
courts,
which
we
think
would
be
inconsistent
with
separation
of
powers,
and
for
those
reasons
we
ask
that
the
court
reverse
the
judgment
and
direct
that
the
case
be
dismissed.
