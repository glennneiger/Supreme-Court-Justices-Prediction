justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
at
what
point
in
this
--
in
what
point
in
this
cascade
did
the
displacement
occur?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
don't
know
what
epa
may
do
down
the
road,
we
don't
know
what
congress
may
do
down
the
road.
so
don't
we
have
to
have
some
idea
about
when
this
takes
place
in
order
so
that
this
precedent
may--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--be
applied
to
the
future
course
of
conduct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
that
that's
not
the
issue
here,
but
does
the
government
have
a
position
on
that
if
--
if
new
york
law
provides
exactly
the
same
public
nuisance
claim
that
is
now
asserted
under
federal
common
law,
would
that
be
consistent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so,
if
there
were
--
if
there
were
no
clean
air
act,
you
would
still
say
that
this
suit,
a
suit
like
this,
would
--
would
fail
prudential
standing,
but
you
don't
have
a
position
as
to
whether
there
would
be
a
claim
under
federal
common
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
does
a
district
judge
decide
what
is
reasonable
and
cost-effective?
there
are
considerations
--
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
emission
of
greenhouse
gases
can
be
totally
prohibited.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
are
other
--
there
are
countervailing
interests.
so
how
does
the
court
--
how
can
a
district
court
balance
those
interests?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
do
you
seriously
argue
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
orders
of
magnitude
more
complicated
than
that
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
anybody
who
is
a
substantial
contributor
could
be
sued?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
if
you
won
and
the
district
court
imposed
some
sort
of
limit
would
be
there
any
other
obstacle
to
other
plaintiffs
bringing
suits
and
another
district
court
issuing
a
different
standard?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
setting
these
standards,
there
would
some
difficult
trade-offs,
wouldn't
there?
could
you
just
explain
in
concrete
terms
how
a
district
judge
would
deal
with
those?
let
--
and
just
determining
the
facts
is
going
to
be
hard
enough,
but
let's
assume
all
the
facts
are
proven,
there's
not
a
dispute
about
the
facts.
so
that
if
a
certain
reduction
in
greenhouse
gas
emissions
is
ordered,
that
will
have
this
effect,
it
will
increase
the
cost
of
electricity
by
a
certain
amount,
and
that
will
produce
certain
effects.
it
will
result
in
the
loss
of
a
certain
number
of
jobs,
it
will
mean
that
consumers
will
have
less
money
to
spend
on
other
--
other
things.
some
people
will
not
be
able
to
have
air
conditioning
in
the
summer.
that
will
have
health
effects.
how
is
the
district
judge
--
what
standard
does
the
district
judge
have
to
decide
those?
it's
just
--
what
is
it,
just
what's
reasonable?
