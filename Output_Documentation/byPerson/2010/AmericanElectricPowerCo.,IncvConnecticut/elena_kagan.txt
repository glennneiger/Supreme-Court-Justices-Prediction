justice
elena
kagan
mr.
keisler,
the
court
did
say
that,
but
it's
cut
off
from
the
court's
actual
analysis
in
the
case.
when
the
court
goes
through
injury
and
causation
and
redressability,
the
court
never
refers
to
the
statutory
cause
of
action.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
court
clearly
understood
that
in
massachusetts
v.
epa
and
said
that
it
was
enough,
and
i
would
think
under
traditional
standing
principles
the
standing
there
was
actually
harder
to
find
because
one
had
to
go
through
the
epa
first.
one
had
to
say
the
epa
should
regulate,
and
then
the
epa
would
regulate,
and
then
the
question
was
would
that
reduce
emissions
levels?
here
the
epa
is
out
of
the
picture.
the
action
is
much
more
direct.
justice
elena
kagan
is
the
consequence
of
that
argument,
mr.
keisler,
that
there
in
fact
is
no
federal
common
law
of
interstate
pollution
claims?
justice
elena
kagan
but
it
seems,
general
katyal,
that
there
also
is
no
case
where
we've
ever
used
this
language
of
generalized
grievance
as
a
prudential
matter
rather
than
as
an
article
iii
matter.
so
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
elena
kagan
but
newdow
--
newdow
quoted
the
language
of
generalized
grievance
that
came
from
warth,
but
it
didn't
specifically
pin
anything
on
that
language.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
general
katyal,
how
about
the
aiken
case,
because
in
the
aiken
case
i
think
the
government
came
in
and
made
the
same
argument,
that
even
though
the
injury
was
concrete,
it
was
too
generalized
and
therefore
there
should
be
no
standing,
the
court
specifically
rejected
that
argument
both
as
to
article
iii
and
as
to
prudential
standing.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
general
katyal,
suppose
that
the
epa
had
decided
not
to
issue
the
endangerment
finding.
would
your
argument
still
apply?
justice
elena
kagan
but
if
i
insisted
you
answer
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you,
what
would
the
answer
be?
no
endangerment
finding.
is
there
displacement?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
have
a
position
on
whether
there's
anything
to
be
displaced
here?
do
you
have
a
position
on
whether
there
is,
in
fact,
a
federal
cause
of
action?
justice
elena
kagan
but
i'm
sorry,
general,
because
i
was
understanding
your
answer
differently,
and
maybe
i
misheard
you,
as
saying
that
if
there
were
no
legislation
here,
you
doubted
that
there
was
a
federal
law
cause
of
action.
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
but
as
to
whether
the
cause
of
action
exists
under
federal
common
law
in
a
case
like
this,
where
you
said
it
was
so
different
from
the
other
federal
common
law
cases
that
the
court
has
seen.
justice
elena
kagan
general,
could
i
take
you
back
on
that
last
point
to
another
threshold
question,
which
is
the
political
question
doctrine?
because
a
lot
of
your
arguments
really
sound
like
prongs
two
and
three
from
baker
v.
carr,
but
you
say
that
we
shouldn't
go
there,
that
we
should
instead
address
this
matter
on
prudential
standing
grounds.
but
the
political
question
doctrine
actually
seems
more
natural,
given
the
kinds
of
arguments
you're
making.
so
why
not?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
general,
they're
usually
facts
that
are
determined
by
an
administrative
agency.
i
mean,
even
just
reading
that
part
of
your
complaint,
it
sounds
like
the
paradigmatic
thing
that
administrative
agencies
do
rather
than
courts.
justice
elena
kagan
but
if
there
were
no
and
if
there
were
no,
we
would
be
living
in
a
different
world.
there
is
an
administrative
agency
and
there
is
a
clean
air
act.
justice
elena
kagan
what
if
the
epa
made
a
judgment,
but
it
just
was
not
the
judgment
that
you
liked?
suppose
that
the
epa
said:
we've
looked
at
stationary
sources;
we're
not
going
to
regulate.
would
that
displace?
justice
elena
kagan
general,
do
you
think
that
you
have
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
against
anybody
in
the
world?
your
briefs
talk
a
lot
about
how
these
are
the
five
largest
emissions
producers,
but
i
saw
nothing
in
your
theory
to
limit
it
to
those
five.
is
there
something
that
you
think
limits
it
to
large
emissions
producers
rather
than
anybody
in
the
world?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
general,
much
of
your
argument
depends
on
this
notion
that
this
suit
is
really
like
any
other
pollution
suit,
but
all
those
other
pollution
suits
that
you've
been
talking
about
are
much
more
localized
affairs.
one
factory
emitting
discharge
into
one
stream.
they
don't
involve
these
kinds
of
national/international
policy
issues
of
the
kind
that
this
case
does.
i
mean,
there's
a
huge
gap,
a
chasm
between
the
precedents
you
have
and
this
case,
isn't
there?
