mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
222
years
that
this
court
has
been
sitting,
it
has
never
heard
a
case
with
so
many
potential
perpetrators
and
so
many
potential
victims,
and
that
quantitative
difference
with
the
past
is
eclipsed
only
by
the
qualitative
differences
presented
today.
accordingly,
the
court
should
apply
the
prudential
standing
doctrine
and
hold
these
lawsuits
not
fit
for
judicial
resolution.
the
very
name
of
the
alleged
nuisance,
"global
warming",
itself
tells
you
much
of
what
you
need
to
know.
there
are
billions
of
emitters
of
greenhouse
gasses
on
the
planet
and
billions
of
potential
victims
as
well.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
it
goes
to
both.
that
is,
this
court
in
outlining
what
the
prudential
standing
doctrine
is
all
about
in,
for
example,
newdow
has
said
the
following
at
page
11:
"without
prudential
standing
limitations,
the
court
would
be
called
upon
to
decide
abstract
questions
of
why
public
significance,
even
though
other
governmental
institutions
may
be
more
competent
to
address
the
questions
and
even
though
judicial
intervention
may
be
unnecessary
to
protect
individual
rights.
"
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
this
case
is
best
like
newdow,
in
which
the
court
went
to
prudential
standing
first
before
article
iii.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
this
court
in
massachusetts
v.
epa,
in
analyzing
the
redressability
prong
of
what
you're
asking
said
that
the
reductions
that
were
sought
there,
if
granted,
would,
quote,
"slow
or
reduce
the
problem".
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
ginsburg,
we're
not
here
saying
that
this
case
follows
inexorably,
inexorably
from
the
facts
of
newdow
or,
frankly,
from
any
case
that
this
court
has
decided.
there
is
no
case
in
the
222
years
that
announces
the
precise
rule
we're
seeking
here,
and
the
reason
is
because
you
have
never
heard
a
case
like
this
before
involving
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
claims
sought
here,
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
think
that
this
court
has
in
newdow
and
in
warth
v.
seldin
used
the
language
of
generalized
grievances
to
reflect
prudential
considerations.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
quite
agree
with
you,
justice
kagan.
this
is
not
like
a
case
in
which
the
government
is
announcing
some
rule
of
standing
that
requires
the
court
to,
for
example,
call
into
question
previous
precedents
of
this
court
that
reached
the
merits
or
something
like
that.
it's
that
this
court
has
never
had
a
case
involving
this
scale
and
scope,
and
we
think
that
the
prudential
standing
doctrine,
at
least
in
a
circumstance
like
this,
which
is
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
in
which
the
court
is
already
being
asked
to
fashion
the
rules
and,
as
justice
scalia
says,
an
equitable
action
in
which
the
court
has
i
think
special
abilities
to
fashion
relief
if
appropriate
and
not
--
i
think
prudential
standing
reflects
best
the
kind
of
tapestry
of
different
factors.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right,
and
i
think
aiken
says
that
the
prudential
standing
cases
thus
far
have
been
about
has
concrete
injury
been
shown
to
a
particular
person.
and
we're
not
disputing
that
for
purposes
of
article
iii
concrete
injury
has
been
shown
to
at
least
one
plaintiff,
but
we
think
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
we
do
disagree
to
that
extent.
we
think
that
prudential
standing
best
reflects
the
court's
general
intuition
in
this
area
that
when
a
problem
is
of
this
magnitude
and
literally
involving
the
world,
where
everyone
is
a
potential
perpetrator,
everyone
is
a
potential
victim,
and
where
their
own
theory
at
page
15
of
their
brief
and
32
and
40
states:
"if
someone
contributes
one
drop
to
the
nuisance,
they
can
be
sued.
"
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
but
i
think
that
the
prudential
standing
doctrine
generally
and
the
zone
of
interest
test
in
particular
really
do
focus
on
this
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
whether
or
not
a
case
can
be
cut
down
to
judicially
manageable
standards.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i'll
move
to
that
and
take
your
invitation,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
before
doing
so,
i
would
say
that
if
you're
going
to
give
me
administrative
law
and
zone
of
interest
i
think
you
should
then
give
me
federal
common
law,
which
this
court
is
at
its
height
in
terms
of
fashioning
who
can
come
into
court
and
what
those
rules
may
be.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
acknowledge
that
the
relief
that
they
are
seeking
looks
like
the
relief
in
massachusetts
v.
epa,
which
is
that
it
would,
if
the
court--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
scalia,
that
isn't
what
the
court
said.
what
the
court
said
is
that
it
would
allow
regulation
in
the
transportation
sector,
which
would
be
approximately
1.7
billion
tons,
and
here
they
are
saying
650
million
tons.
and
so,
i
agree
it's
less,
but
i
think
that
the
--
and
one
can
criticize
the
reasoning
in
the
majority,
but
if
that
--
that
is
the
rule
of
this
court,
and
i
think
that
as
long
as
a
slowing
or
reduction--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
is
what
the
court
based
its
redressability
analysis
on.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
of
course
not.
i'm
just
saying
that
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--but
i
am
talking--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--right.
and
i'm
just
talking
about
the
redressability
part
of
the
analysis,
justice
scalia.
for
that
the
court
said
that
this
reduction
in
the
transportation
sector
was
sufficient.
if
i
could
take
the
mr.
--
the
chief
justice's
invitation
to
address
displacement
at
this
time.
we
believe
that
we
meet
the
state's
own
test
for
displacement,
which
is
found
at
page
46
of
their
brief,
which
is:
"a
federal
common
law
nuisance
claim
is
displaced
when
a
federal
statute
or
regulatory
action
addresses
the
nuisance.
"
and
here
you
have
not
just
the
clean
air
act,
you
have
the
clean
air
act
plus,
a
cascade
of
a
number
of
different
actions
taken
after,
justice
scalia,
the
opinion
in
massachusetts
v.
epa.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
think
that
the
court
doesn't
really
need
to
get
into
it.
and
for
the
--
the
reason
is
this:
displacement
actions
are
extremely
rare,
federal
common
law
actions
are
rare,
so
we
don't
think
you
should
announce
some
sort
of
general
standard
for
when
displacement
occurs.
it's
a
more
case-by-case
situation.
here
you
have
undoubted
evidence
that
it
occurred
--
that
it
has
occurred
because
of
a
number
of
different
things.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
certainly--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--certainly,
justice
alito,
i
think
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
to
look
at
what
has
--
what
is
happening
right
now.
and
here's
what's
happening.
first,
in
december
2009
the
epa
issued
an
endangerment
finding,
finding
these
greenhouse
gases
significant
pollutants.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
that
that
would
present
a
difficult
case,
because
it
would
be
the
one
like
the
petitioners
make,
which
is
the
clean
air
act
alone.
and
i
think
that
what
the
states
themselves
acknowledge
and
what
the
language
of
milwaukee
ii
--
excuse
me
--
milwaukee
i
says
in
it
is
that
--
and
this
is
at
page
107
of
the
opinion:
"it
may
happen
that
new
federal
laws
and
new
federal
regulations
may
in
time
preempt
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
"
"we
think
that
both
together
presents
the
best
and
easiest
case
for
displacement.
"
and
you
have
that
here.
you
have
not
just
the
endangerment
finding;
you
have
the
epa
regulating
all
passenger
cars,
all
light
motor
vehicles
right
now.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
that
it's
a
--
it's
a
difficult
case
to
make
for
--
for
displacement,
but
i
think
it
could
be
made,
for
the
reasons
mr.
keisler
suggests.
but
i--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
i
think
that
there's
a
good
argument
to
be
made.
i
imagine
the
argument
on
the
other
side
that
you'll
hear
in
a
moment
is
that
the
clean
air
act
doesn't
look
precisely
like
the
clean
water
act
in
terms
of
forcing
the
agency
to
decide
various
things.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
that
very
well
may
be.
and
with
respect
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
had
asked
before
about
state
common
law
causes
of
action
and
whether
they
would
be
--
they
would
kind
--
the
existence
of
those
would
somehow
mean
that
the
court
should
either
find
jurisdiction
or
reach
the
merits
in
a
way.
and
we
think
that
the
same
arguments
that
prohibit
the
court
from
--
from
--
from
recognizing
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
for
displacement
very
well
may
be
preemption
questions
as
well
that
could
be
addressed
down
the
road
with
respect
to
state
common
law
actions.
and
we
don't
think
the
court
should
be
troubled
by
the
existence
of
a
potential
state
common
law
cause
of
action.
it's
just
like
milwaukee
ii,
in
which
the
dissenters
made
precisely
this
argument.
they
said:
if
you
don't
recognize
it,
then
the
states
will
regulate
it
and
it
will
balkanize
and
the
like.
and
what
the
majority
said
is:
that's
a
question
for
down
the
road;
the
question
for
now
is
has
displacement
occurred?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
--
i
don't
think
we
have
a
position
at
this
time
on
that.
that's
i
think
an
enormously
complicated
question
we
can
get
to
at
an
appropriate
time.
our
central
--
our
central
submission
to
you
on
displacement
is
this:
that
there
is
literally
no
precedent
for
the
argument
that
they
are
making
here,
which
is
that
the
federal
government
has
to
regulate
the
precise
jot
and
tittle,
the
specific
relief
that
they
are
seeking
before
displacement
occurs.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
we
think,
again,
the
court
doesn't
need
to
get
into
that
question
because
it
--
you
know,
the
--
there
are
few
federal
common
law
causes
of
action
in
the
area
of
nuisance
--
i
mean,
and
there
have
been
two
that
the
federal
government
has
filed
since
1970
and
three
that
we
can
find
all
together
in
the
federal
courts
of
appeals,
all
of
which
have
failed
for
various
displacement
reasons,
and
the
others.
we
think
none
of
those
look
anything
like
the
--
the
common
law
cause
of
action
here.
and,
so,
it
would
at
least
require
this
court
to
extend
quite
dramatically
federal
common
law
to
cover
this
type
of
situation
in
which
everyone
is
a
potential
perpetrator
and
everyone
is
a
potential
victim.
and
it
would
require
the
court,
in
fashioning
relief,
to
think
through
a
number
of
things
that
the
federal
courts
haven't
ever
had
to
grapple
with
from
the
nature--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
is
correct.
we
think
it
would
still
fail
prudential
standing
because
of
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
nature
of
the
problem
here,
and
the
multitude
of
different
policy
judgments
that
would
be
required
--
that
this
court
would
be
required
to
undertake
to
adjudicate
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
in
the
absence
of
a
statute.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
doubted
that
there
was
prudential
standing.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
--
i
--
i
think
i
put
it
as
we
doubt
it.
i
mean,
i
think
that
it
would
require
a
dramatic
extension,
justice
kagan,
of
a
case
like
tennessee
copper
and
the
other
cases
that
this
court
has
heard,
which
are
essentially:
a
pollutes
a
river
or
something
and
hurts
b.
a
here
is
the
world
and
b
is
the
world,
and
that
is
such
a
difference
in
scale
and
scope
to
pose
enormously
difficult
questions
as
to
whether
this
court
should
recognize
such
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well
--
well,
there
may
be
arguments,
justice
kennedy
--
i'm
not
sure
if
the
premise
of
your
question
has
a
clean
air
act
in
existence
or
not.
there
may
be
some
sort
of
arguments
about
displacement
or
preemption
under
the
clean
air
act--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--then
i
think
that
again
for
purposes
of
state
common
law,
i
think
this
court
would
approach
that
question
the
same
way
it
did
in
milwaukee
ii,
which
is
to
say
that's
a
really
separate
policy-based
question
that
the
court
doesn't
use
to
answer
the
questions
about
whether
a
cause
of
action
should
be
recognized
or
whether
displacement
has
occurred.
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
states
that
have
sued
generally
have
doctrines
like
prudential
standing,
doctrines
like
political
question,
that
may
very
well
bar
the
reaching
of
these
claims
in
state
courts
as
well.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
precisely
the
situation
that
--
that
this
court
was
grappling
with
in
milwaukee
ii,
and
it
said
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely,
justice
ginsburg.
let
me
say
three
things
about
that.
first
is,
epa
is
currently
regulating
existing
sources.
to
the
extent
that
a
power
plant
is
modified
in
any
way
to
increase
carbon
dioxide
above
a
certain
amount
--
and
this
is
one
of
the
so-called
tailoring
rules
--
then
those
power
plants
right
now
are
subject
to
regulation.
indeed,
one
has
already
had
to
get
a
permit.
these
regulations
just
went
into
effect
in
january
2011
for
existing
power
plants
that
seek
to
modify.
second,
there
is
a
settlement
agreement
in
place
that
commits
epa
by
may
of
2012
to
deciding
how
and
whether
to
regulate
existing
power
sources,
the
existing
stationary
sources.
and
third,
and
i
think
most
fundamentally,
there
is
no
precedent,
justice
ginsburg,
that
says
that
the
government
must
regulate
the
specific
industry,
the
specific
thing
that
the
plaintiff
isolates,
in
order
for
displacement
to
occur.
rather,
sea
clammers
and
milwaukee
ii
i
think
make
explicit
that
that's
the
wrong
question.
and
so
long
as
the
nuisance
is
being
addressed
--
and
here
the
nuisance
is
undoubtedly
being
addressed
with
a
panoply
of
different
federal
actions
in
the
area
of
global
warming,
and
an
executive
order
that
says
that
fighting
global
warming
is
one
of
the
government's
highest
priorities
--
and
concrete
steps
taken,
such
as
the
500-page
tailoring
rule,
the
400-page
--
the
--
the
other
hundreds
of
pages
that
epa
has
done
with
its
experts
to
appropriately
regulate
greenhouse
gas
emissions,
as
opposed
to
a
federal
common
law
court
of
action
doing
something
which
would
frankly
put
you
all
at
sea
in
terms
of
the
complexity,
economics,
international
nature
of
the
problem.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
justice
kagan,
i'm
not
going
to
tarry
too
long
on
which
different
way
we
should
win
this
case.
i
think
either
is
an
appropriate
way.
[laughter]
but
i
think
that
the
prudential
standing
doctrine
is
a
bit
narrower
because
it
--
it
contemplates
a
variety
of
factors,
including
the
fact
that
this
is
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
where
the
court
is
fashioning
relief
in
the
first
place,
as
opposed
to
the
political
question
doctrine
which
looks
--
looks
more
to
the
standardless
nature
of
the
adjudication.
we
agree
that
--
that
the
political
question
doctrine
is
an
appropriate
way
to
dismiss
of
this
case,
but
we
think
that,
like
newdow,
like
kowalski,
this
court
can
handle
this
case
on
prudential
standing
first
and
recognize
that
this
is
an
unprecedented
action
involving
literally
the
world,
and
it
is
not
suited
for
judicial
resolution,
and
that
flows
quite
naturally
from
the
precepts
of
the
prudential
standing
doctrine.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
ginsburg,
we
quite
agree,
and
that
is
why
we
say
that
if
a
statute
were
--
were
announced
to
provide
standards,
that
that
would
provide
a
way
around
the
political
question
problem
that
exists
in
this
case.
