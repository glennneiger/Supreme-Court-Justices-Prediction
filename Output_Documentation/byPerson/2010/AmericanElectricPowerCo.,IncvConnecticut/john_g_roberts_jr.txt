chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
today
in
case
10-174,
american
electric
power
company
v.
connecticut,
et
al.--
mr.
keisler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
exactly
one
thing
that's
concerned
me.
they
do
all
flow
from
the
same
basic
argument,
and
i'm
concerned
why
you
think
we
should
focus
on
prudential
standing,
basically,
which
cuts
off
our
jurisdiction
at
our
own
whim,
as
opposed
to
dealing
with
this
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
either
case,
your
argument
is
that
this
is
too
generalized
for
the
court
to
--
to
address.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
many
states
does
it
take?
i
think,
you
know,
if
it's
three
states
who
have
made
that
allegation,
i
don't
know
exactly
how
you
draw
the
line
between
a
case
like
tennessee
copper
and
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
keisler.
general
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
don't
usually
--
your
phrase
is
exactly
what
bothers
me.
we
don't
usually
base
a
decision
on
our
general
intuition,
and
the
idea
of
prudential
standing
that
we
have
jurisdiction
of
the
case
but
we're
not
going
to
decide
it
is
contrary
to
chief
justice
marshall's
famous
line
that
if
we
don't
have
jurisdiction,
we
can't
decide
it,
but
if
we
do,
we
have
to
decide
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'll
give
that
you
on
the
zone
of
interests,
but
there
you're
dealing
with
administrative
law
and
a
very
narrow
proposition.
i
think
it's
justice
kennedy's
point,
or
at
least
the
point
of
his
questions,
that
these
issues
meld
into
the
merits
and,
at
least
for
anyone
who
is
troubled
by
the
idea
that
we
are
not
going
to
decide
a
case
even
though
we
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
it,
maybe
that's
the
better
place
to
address
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
it
--
i
don't
want
to
make
--
try
to
make
a
case
for
you,
but
why
is
it
that
much
more
difficult?
it's
just
--
i
mean,
it's
sort
of
like
the
negative
commerce
clause,
right?
the
fact
that
epa
has
the
authority
to
regulate
in
a
particular
area
means
that
the
ball
has
passed
from
the
courts
to
the
agency,
to
the
executive
branch,
and
they've
made
an
implicit
decision
not
to
regulate
a
particular
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
that
would
be
a
preemption
question
rather
than
--
rather
than
a
displacement
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
general
underwood.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
is
the
--
what
factors
go
into
the
cost-benefit
analysis
that
would
have
to
be
undertaken
to
decide
what
level
of
emissions
are
reasonable
in
light
of
the
threat
of
global
--
global
warming?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
obviously
the
greatest
benefit
to
reduce
global
warming
would
be,
of
course,
to
shut
down
the
power
plants,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
--
right.
but
i
mean,
across
the
economy,
the
whole
problem
of
dealing
with
global
warming
is
that
there
are
costs
and
benefits
on
both
sides,
and
you
have
to
determine
how
much
you
want
to
readjust
the
world
economy
to
address
global
warming,
and
i
think
that's
a
pretty
big
burden
to
post
--
to
impose
on
a
district
court
judge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we're
dealing
with
an
electric
grid
that
connects
i
don't
know
how
vast
an
area,
but
certainly
a
vast
area
here.
and
the
fact
that
they
can
reduce
their
emissions
in
a
way
that
doesn't
affect
their
customers
is
based
on
the
fact
that
other
power
plants
that
are
part
of
the
grid
will
serve
part
of
those
--
will
serve
the
customers'
needs
to
some
extent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
i
suppose
there
were
reasons
that
congress
adopted
that
approach,
and
your
suit
would
override
those
determinations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
much
--
how
much
regulation
do
you
need
before
you
would
admit
that
there
is
displacement?
is
it
--
is
it
a
preemption
analysis
that
you're
adopting
or
a
displacement
analysis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
--
what
is
your
test
for
displacement?
when
do
we
tell
whether
there's
displacement
or
not?
has
there
been
some
displacement
in
this
case
but
just
not
total
displacement
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
sounds
like
--
that
sounds
like
preemption
to
me
and
not
displacement,
or
at
least
preemption
with
another
label.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe
you
can
tell
me
in
what
--
to
what
extent
displacement
is
different
from
preemption.
tell
me
in
this
area
you're
going
to
have
displacement
but
not
preemption.
or
i
guess
it's
the
other
way
around,
in
which
there's
going
to
be
preemption
but
not
--
well,
what's
the
difference?
you
said
in
response
to
justice
kagan
that
if
they've
made
a
considered
decision
that
this
is
the
amount
and
no
other
amount
higher
or
lower,
then
there
would
be
displacement.
in
what
way
is
that
different
from
preemption?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
you're
right
that
under
your
theory
they
operate
pretty
similarly
and
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
milwaukee
v.
illinois
was
that
they
are
two
very
distinct
propositions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
do
you
stop
at
u.s.
emissions?
what
percentage
of
worldwide
emissions,
every
one
of
which
i
assume
harms
your
clients,
do
these
five
power
plants
represent?
infinitesimal,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
from
power
plants
or
total
emissions?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
--
general
katyal
began
his
argument
in
fairly
dramatic
fashion
by
saying
we've
never
in
222
years
had
a
case
where
the
relief,
the
damages
and
the
relief
sought,
were
as
broad
as
they
are
here.
do
you
have
anything
to
rebut
his
proposition?
any
case
where
it
has
been
as
broad
as
it
is
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
your
best
--
what's
your
candidate
to
rebut
his
proposition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
broader
case
with
respect
to
the
infliction
of
damage
and
the
need
for
relief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
not
as
many
as
contribute
to
global
warming?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
no,
it's
not,
and
it's
not
true
of
every
litigation
in
this
sense,
that
everyone
is
harmed
by
global
warming.
so
unless
you
limit
your
suits
to
the
states,
which
would
--
i'm
not
aware
of
a
principled
basis
for
doing
that
--
every
individual
can
bring
--
every
individual
in
the
world
if
they
can
establish
jurisdiction
can
bring
one
of
these
cause
of
--
causes
of
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess,
just
to
follow
up,
what
is
the
appellate
court
reviewing?
is
it
reviewing
the
reasonableness
of
epa's
judgment
or
the
continuing
validity
of
the
injunction
it
entered
previously?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
seems
to
be
a
displacement
of
the
normal
process
of
administrative
law,
which
we
would
review
the
agency's
determination
of
how
best
and
to
what
extent
to
regulate
the
emissions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
and
i
guess
that's
the
central
problem.
once
you
turn
it
over
to
litigation,
it's
an
entirely
different
set
of
standards
that
would
regulate
emissions
as
opposed
to
the
standards
that
would
apply
with
respect
to
an
agency's
determination.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
underwood.
mr.
keisler,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
keisler,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
