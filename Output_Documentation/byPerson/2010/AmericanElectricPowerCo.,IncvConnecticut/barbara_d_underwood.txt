ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
rests
on
the
longstanding
fundamental
authority
of
the
states
to
protect
their
land,
their
natural
resources,
and
their
citizens
from
air
pollution
emitted
in
other
states.
it
rests
on
three
propositions:
one,
the
interests
of
the
states
are
harmed
by
global
warming;
two,
these
defendants,
as
the
five
largest
u.s.
emitters
of
carbon
dioxide,
are
significant
contributors
to
it;
and,
three,
these
defendants
could
take
reasonable,
cost-effective
measures
to
reduce
their
emissions
in
a
way
that
would
slow
the
effects
of
global
warming.
we
will
have
to
prove
these
propositions,
and
after
we
do
the
district
court
will
have
to
determine
whether
it
can
frame
an
appropriate
equitable
injunction.
that's
what
discovery
and
trials
are
for.
but
this
court
should
not
close
the
courthouse
door
to
this
case
at
the
outset.
the
common
law
action
for
public
nuisance
has
been
around
for
hundreds
of
years,
has
been
adapted
by
courts
to
cover
new
environmental
threats,
and
there's
no
reason
why
the
courts
can't
do
the
same
thing
here.
the
defendants
say
there
are
too
many
plaintiffs,
too
many
potential
defendants,
and
that
adjudication
of
this
case
will
require
courts
to
solve
the
entire
problem
of
global
warming,
but
that
is
simply
not
so.
on
the
plaintiffs'
side,
this
is
about
the
states.
we
are
alleging
the
kind
of
injury
to
states
that
has
been
traditionally
recognized
by
this
court;
their
lands,
their
citizens,
their
businesses
are
being
injured
by
pollution
emitted
in
other
states.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it's
not
as
a
super
epa.
it's
something
much
smaller.
it's
a
different
question.
interstate
pollution
disputes
have
historically
been
entrusted
to
the
courts,
including
the
determination
of
how
much
is
unreasonable,
which
is--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
it's
also
like
what
the
court
did
in
tennessee
copper.
that
is
to
say,
this
case
doesn't
ask
the
court
to
decide
how
much,
contrary
to
what
petitioners
suggest,
to
decide
how
much
emission
reduction
is
required
to
solve
the
whole
problem
of
global
warming
and
then
allocate
a
portion
to
these
defendants.
it
asks
the
court
to
do
something
simpler,
and
that
is
to
decide
whether
these
defendants
can
take
reasonable
cost-effective
measures
that
would
help
to
slow
the
pace
of
global
warming.
so--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
would
say
two
things
about
that.
one,
it
was
also
true
in
tennessee
copper
that
it
was
not
the
case
that
the
sulfur
emissions
could
be
eliminated
or
that
the
plant
was
to
be
put
out
of
business.
the
court
in
that
case
ordered
a
reduction
of
sulfur,
a
quite
specific
reduction
of
sulfur
emissions
in
one
season
and
more
in
another
season.
and
how
does--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it's
somewhat
more
--
it's
larger.
i
don't
know
if
it's
more
complicated.
the
way
a
court
would
do
that
is
presumably
the
way
it
did
it
in
tennessee
copper.
that
is,
there
could
be
expert
testimony,
there
could
also
be
evidence
about
whether
--
what
other
emitters
are
doing,
what
they
do
that
is
feasible
and
cost-effective
to
reduce
their
emissions.
in
tennessee
copper,
one
of
the
defendants
settled,
and
the
other
was
subject
to
an
order,
and
it
would
have
been
available
to
the
court
to
look
to
what
the
settling
defendant
did
for
some
indication
of
what
the
nonsettling
defendant
might
well
be
ordered
to
do.
so
there
is
evidence
available
from
which
a
court
could
conclude
what
is
reasonable.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
available
technology,
the
cost
of
that
technology--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
we
haven't
asked
for
that
and
nobody
suggests
that
that
would
be
appropriate.
it's
not,
any
more
than
it
was
in
tennessee
copper.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
it's
also
a
burden
that
the
plaintiffs
would
have
to
bear.
that
is
to
say,
we
have
alleged,
and
are
entitled
to
try
to
prove
--
and
we
might
fail;
that
would
be
for
the
district
judge
to
determine
--
that
"the
defendants
have
available
to
them
practical,
feasible.
"
--i'm
reading
from
the
complaint
--
"and
economically
viable
options
for
reducing
carbon
dioxide
emissions
without
significantly
increasing
the
cost
of
electricity
to
their
customers,
including
changing
fuels,
improving
efficiency,
and
altering--
"
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it
may
or
may
not
be
based
on
this.
these
are
facts
that
can
be
proven
or
not
proven
at
trial.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
but
if
there
were
no
agency
and
if
there
were
no
clean
air
act
and
somebody
was
shooting
poison
into
the
air
in
a
way
that
injured
people
in
another
state,
the
states
would
have
the--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--but
those
--
those
are
questions
about
what
has
been
called
the
merits
or
displacement.
the
question
of
article
iii
standing,
the
question
of
justiciability,
the
question
of
political
question,
those
are
the
same
questions
whether
there's
an
agency
or
not.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
justice
kennedy
--
in
front
of
us,
and
i
thought
that's
what
we
were
addressing.
we
can
talk
about
the
displacement
argument.
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
that
--
i
understood
the
question
of
standards
to
be
a
question
addressed
to
the
political
question
point.
and
even
if
it
might
be
desirable
to
have
an
agency
set
standards,
it
is
not
something
that
is
beyond
the
power
of
a
court
to
do.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
we
do
not
ignore
that.
this
is
a
very
peculiar
moment
in
time
for
this
case
to
arrive
in
this
court,
because
what
is
offered
as
displacing
is
something
that
is
said
to
be
imminent,
not
something
that
actually
exists,
and
something
that
is
imminent
may
never
happen.
it
was,
of
course,
for
that
reason
that
i
believe
the
united
states
suggested
a
gbr
and
we
suggested
that
the
case
be
dismissed
so
that
the
lower
courts
could
deal
with
the
unfolding
events
as
they
occur.
but
the
case
is
here
now,
and
there
is
no
federal
statute
or
regulation
that
currently
regulates
the
emission
of
greenhouse
gases
by
existing
unmodified
power
plants,
like
the
ones
operated
by
the
defendants.
and
the
clean
air
act
works
very
differently
from
the
clean
water
act.
it
did
not
put
in
place
a
permit
system
for
all
emissions
when
it
was
enacted
in
1970.
unlike
the
clean
water
act
2
years
later,
which
forbids
all
discharges
until
they're
authorized
by
permit,
the
clean
air
act
doesn't
regulate
anything
until
the
epa
makes
findings
and
imposes
restrictions.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
our
suit
is
consistent
with
those
determinations.
that
is
to
say,
the
design
of
the
statute
leaves
preexisting
law
in
place
until
epa
steps
in.
if
the
clean
air
act
were
thought
to
displace
the
common
law
before
any
regulation
occurred,
that
would
mean
the
immediate
effect
of
this
antipollution
law
in
1970
was
to
reduce
pollution
control
because--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it's
a
displacement
analysis.
i
believe
it's
a
displacement
analysis.
what
--
what
we
start
from
is
that
the
states
have
a
historic
right
to
go
to
court
under
the
federal
common
law
and
that
to
--
to
--
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
interstate
pollution,
and
that
that
was
a
promise
that
they
obtained,
the
federal
remedy,
in
exchange
for
the
surrender
of
sovereignty
in
joining
the
union.
so
there
has
to
be
--
there's
a
strong
federal
interest
in
there
being
a
federal
remedy.
now,
when
the
clean
air
act
was
--
was
passed,
without
any
regulations,
if
it
displaced
the
federal
common
law,
there
would
be
no
federal
law
applicable
at
all,
because
the
federal
common
law
would
be
displaced
and
there
would
be
no
federal
regulatory
law.
the
states
would
have
recourse
at
that
point
to
state
common
law,
as
has
been
suggested.
that
would
be
available
still.
but
this
court
has
said
repeatedly,
and
it's
correct,
that
there
is
a
strong
federal
interest
in
regulating
this
subject
matter
of
interstate
pollution
with
federal
law.
federal
common
law
is
the
default
position,
and
when
some
--
when
--
when
congress
and
the
agency
act
to
displace
federal
law
and
put
in
place
--
to
displace
federal
common
law
and
put
in
place
federal
regulatory
law,
that's
when
the
displacement
occurs.
so
when--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there's
been
displacement
as
to
automobiles.
the
epa
made
a
considered
judgment
about
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
with
respect
to
light
motor
vehicles.
the
epa
has
made
no
judgment
with
respect
to
stationary
sources.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
think
if
it
were
a
judgment
that
the
amount
of
carbon
dioxide
emission
from
stationary
sources
that
was
currently
happening
was
the
--
was
the
correct
amount,
that
would
displace.
if
the--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
of
course,
there
are
some
similarities
between
the
two.
in
each
case
we're
talking
about
whether
federal
--
whether
one
law
substitutes
for
another,
whether
one
law
ousts
another.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
the
difference
isn't
on
that
front.
the
difference
is
that
with
respect
to
preemption
congress
has
to
decide
that
it
does
--
that
it
wishes
to
override
state
law
expressly.
here
what
we're
talking
about
is
simply
whether
congress
or
the
agency
has
acted.
it's
a
little
different.
they
don't
have
to
have
in
mind
federal
common
law.
they
simply
have
to
act
in
a
way
that
over
--
that
--
that
substitutes
for
federal
common
law,
because
the
promise
of
the
republic
really
for
the
states
was
that
the
states
would
have
a
federal
law
applicable
to
their
interstate
pollution
disputes,
and
until--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there's
a
new
one,
they
have
the
old
one.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
but
--
perhaps
not.
but
we
--
we
talk
about,
though,
whether
there
was
intent
--
that
--
that
preemption
is
ultimately
a
matter
of
congressional
intent
and
whether
congress
intended
and
--
and
preemption
should
not
be
lightly
inferred.
it's
probably
the
case
that
preemption
should
be
harder
to
find
in
a
close
case.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
think
in
this
context
they
probably
work
pretty
similarly.
i
would
just
say
that
in
each
case
the
question
is,
what
is
the
--
what
does
the
new
law
do
with
respect
to
the
law
that
it
is
said
to
replace?
and--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
they
have
different
reasons
for
existing,
that's
certainly
what
milwaukee
v.
illinois
said.
that
doesn't
mean
they
have
to
in
every
instance
operate
differently.
the
point
of
preemption
is
about
the
federal-state
balance,
and
displacement
is
simply
--
is
about
separation
of
powers
and
the
interaction
of
various
agencies
within
the
federal
government.
it
shouldn't
be
surprising--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
you
say
the
court
substituting
for
the
epa.
it
would
be
the
epa
substituting
for
the
court.
that
is,
the
default,
the
beginning
position
before
there
was
legislation,
before
there
was
an
agency,
was
a
common
law
remedy.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
tva
suggests
that
there's
an
inexorable
march,
that
there's
a
regulatory
program
underway.
but
what
they
point
to
is
an
agreement
by
epa
to
begin
considering
whether
to
regulate
new
and
existing
power
plants.
that
can't
be
enough.
the
federal
common
law
exists
for
the
purpose
of
giving
states
a
remedy
for
interstate
pollution,
and
if
it's
displaced
when
--
when
the
epa
begins
thinking
about
it,
then
epa
could
think
about
it
for
a
long
time.
they've
said
when
they
hope
to
complete
this
rulemaking,
but
it
is
not
uncommon
for
delays
to
--
to
enter
into
such
processes,
and
it
could
be
a
long
time
before
epa
actually
arrives
at
a
judgment.
a
lot
can
happen
to
delay
or
derail
the
fulfillment
of
a
promise.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
i
think
limitations,
a
limitation
to
substantial
sources
--
and
i'll
talk
in
a
minute
about
what
that
might
mean
--
comes
from
the
restatement
definition,
from
garden
variety
state
cases
about
--
involving
nuisance,
and
also
perhaps
from
the
requirements
of
standing
itself.
this
case
asks
the
court
to
recognize
that
the
states
can
sue
the
largest
emitters
of
carbon
dioxide.
these
defendants
produce
650
million
tons
a
year
or
10
percent
of
u.s.
emissions,
and
individually
they
produce
amounts
ranging
from
1
to
3
and
a
half
percent
of
u.s.
emissions.
there
is
no
other
company
that
comes
close
except
perhaps
for
a
handful
of
the
next
largest
power
companies.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
courts
sometimes--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--courts
sometimes
aggregate
joint
contributors
to
pollution,
particularly
where
the
remedy
that's
sought
is
injunctive
relief.
if
this
were
a
damage
action
there
would
be
a
different
problem
of
allocating
to
each
individual
defendant.
but
the
relief
that's
sought
here
is
the
same
injunction.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no.
i
think
that
breathers
are
not
really
--
for
one
thing,
they
don't
even
really
contribute
carbon
dioxide
because
they
absorb
as
well
as
--
as
exhale
it.
for
another
thing,
there's
no
way
that
breathing--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--could
be
found
unreasonable.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
we're
talking--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it
is
not
necessary
to
aggregate
to
have
these
five
defendants
stand
apart
from
everybody
else.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--3
1/2
percent
of
u.s.
emissions.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
not
infinitesimal,
actually.
i
believe
that
u.s.
emissions
are
a
quarter
of
world
emissions,
so
you
would
divide
these
numbers
by
four
approximately.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
total
emissions.
and--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
and
in
terms
of
determining
what
--
who
is
a
substantial
contributor,
there
are
--
because
i
do
think
that
at
some
point
a
company's
emissions
or
a
cow's
would
be
too
small
to
give
rise
to
a
standing
or
--
to
either
standing
or
a
nuisance
claim,
and
there
are
various
ways
to
draw
the
lines.
it's
a
familiar
task
for
common
law
courts
to
decide
how
much
is
substantial,
too.
but
for
an
example,
if
the
cut-off
were
producers
of
100,000
tons
per
year,
as
in
the
epa
tailoring
rule
for
new
sources,
just
to
take
an
example,
then
according
to
epa's
own
technical
data
there
would
be
at
most
a
few
thousand
potential
defendants.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
of
course
it
depends
on
what
you
call
broad.
there
are
--
there
are
many
cases,
small
cases
involving
an
attempt
to
limit
discharges
by
companies.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
guess
what
i
would
say
is
that
cases
allowing
suits
against
large
contributors,
with
or
without
others,
and
dismissing
against
small
and
remote
contributors,
i
give
you
three
state
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
briefs:
a
california
case
about
a
large
mine
that
was
sued
for
polluting
a
river
when
lots
of
--
lots
of
others
polluted
it
and
were
not
before
the
court.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
that's
correct.
but
we
could
talk
about
--
if
we
talk
about
large
contributors
here,
then
we're
not
talking
about
so
many
contributors.
we
could
have
it
--
we
could
have
it
down
to,
to
thousands
or
hundreds
or
tens,
depending
on
how
we
defined
large.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no.
well,
the
parens
patriae
actions
by
the
states
might
have
some
consequence
for
the
citizens
of
those
states,
but,
yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
there
would
be
others
who
have
--
would
have
--
who
would
have
the
ability,
other
states,
i
suppose.
i
mean,
our
claim
here
is
that
this
federal
common
law
nuisance
is
available
first
and
foremost
for
the
states;
and
the
question
of
whether
the
land
trusts
or
any
other
private
parties
could
even
bring
it
is--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
the
--
ultimately
such
things
would
be
resolved
by
appeal
and
by
--
by
the
circuit
courts.
i
mean,
there
are
conflicts
in
many
areas.
that's
true
about
every
district
court
litigation.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
a
principal
basis
to
limit
--
the
common
--
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance,
as
i
said,
exists
principally
for
the
states,
for
the
reason
it
survived
erie
was
the
court
spoke
of
the
strong
federal
interest
in
providing
the
states
with
a
remedy
for
interstate
pollution.
so
there
is
a
principle
there.
and
then
beyond
the
states,
plaintiffs
would
have
to,
to
bring
a
common
law
nuisance
claim
as
well
as
to
have
standing,
would
have
to
have
a
special
injury
of
some
kind
that
would
distinguish
them
from
the
general
--
from
the
general
public.
the
land
trusts
here
argue
that
they,
because
they
hold
their
lands
in
trust
for
the
public,
they
have
special
standing.
that's
--
there's
no
need
to
reach
that
question.
this
case
could
turn
and
should
turn
on
the
right
of
the
states
to
protect
their
people
from
--
and
their
--
and
their
land
from
--
from
interstate--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
don't
know
if
i
would
call
it
a
chasm,
but
there's
a
large
distance
between
them,
and
--
but
i
would
like
to
separate
two
things.
the
international
aspects
of
this
are
simply,
i
think,
beyond
--
we're
not
suggesting
that
this
--
this
--
that
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
entails
relief
against
international
defendants.
it
does
exist
for
interstate
--
for
conflicts
between
the
states
essentially.
so
i
would
like
to
put
those
aside.
and
then,
in
terms
of
the
magnitude,
well,
there
are
many
cases,
not
just
one
factory,
the
milwaukee
v.
illinois
itself
involved
not
just
the
milwaukee
sewage
district
that
--
that
was
sued,
but
there
were
many
other
contributors
to
pollution
in
that
lake.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
reasonableness
is
the
beginning.
i
--
i've
suggested
already
first
that
we've
alleged
that
this
can
be
done
without
increasing
the
cost
to
the
consumers.
that
may
seem
--
that
--
that
is
a
subject
for
proof.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
but
a
very
good
place
to
look
is
what
other
companies
have
been
able
to
do
or
have
done,
including,
as
i
suggested,
in
tennessee
copper
and
perhaps
in
this
area
as
well,
companies
that
settle
this
litigation
or
companies
that
don't
litigate
but
instead
do
adopt
measures
that
haven't
been
widely
adopted.
there
--
there
is
a
practice
to
examine
in
the
world
about
what's
feasible
and
what's
cost-effective,
and
that's
not
different
from--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
don't
think
so.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
because
the
common
law
of
nuisance
is
addressed
to
direct
the
polluter
to
abate
the
nuisance.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
actually,
the
order
we're
asking
for
is
less
intrusive
than
that.
we
ask
the
defendants
to
abate
the
nuisance,
we
ask
the
court
to
order
them
to
abate
the
nuisance
by
some
amount,
informed
by
what
information
is
available
about
methods.
and
then--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--because--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
because
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
court
would
get
into
the
details
on
our
theory,
either.
it
would
be
the
defendants
that
would
get
into
the
details,
that
would
figure
out
for
themselves
what
the
best
way
was
to
meet
these
standards
--
to
meet
the
objective.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
and
of
course
it's
true
that
if
you
conclude
that
the
federal
statutes
displace
the
federal
--
and
the
federal
regulations
displace
the
federal
common
law
either
now
or
in
the
future,
then
under
ouellette,
the
same
federal
statute
that
displaces
federal
common
law
will
revive
source
state
common
law,
because
of
the
savings
clause
in
that
statute,
because
of
a
choice
congress
made;
and
that
result,
while
less
--
less
respectful
of
the
federal
interest
in
providing
federal
law
to
govern
these
disputes,
would
nevertheless
leave
common
law
courts
in
the
business
that
they're
--
of
attempting
to
address
unaddressed
pollution
problems.
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
the
epa
has
entered
the
field
of
greenhouse
gas,
and
that's
enough,
but
it
isn't
just
one
field.
it
only
seems
like
one
because
the
epa
once
said
the
whole
subject
was
off
limits
and
beyond
their
jurisdiction.
once
that
obstacle
is
removed,
there
still
remain
a
series
of
programs
under
the
statute,
a
series
of
kinds
of
sources
that
need
to
be
regulated.
the
clean
air
act
regulates
by
substance
and
by
source.
it's
a
collection
of
statutory
programs,
and
taking
action
under
one
program
can't
displace
the
common
law
as
it
applies
to
matters
outside
that
program.
it
may
well
be
that
there
will
be
a
regulation
soon
that
displaces,
but
it
would
be
very
surprising
if
this
court
concluded
that
the
promise
of
regulation
is
enough
to
displace
the
federal
common
law
as
distinguished
from
the
actuality
of
it.
the
court
has
suggested
that
a
court
might
impose
standards
that
would
conflict
with
what
the
epa
is
doing,
but
there's
really
no
reason
to
think
that
would
happen
because
if
what
a
court
sets
out
to
do
is
find
out
what
feasible
methods
there
are
for
reduction
and
then
order
the
defendants
to
make
reductions
that
are
feasible,
that's
a
much
less
taxing
inquiry,
a
much
less
demanding
inquiry
than
the
epa
is
likely
ultimately
to
make.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
you
mean
an
emission
reduction?
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
if
the
epa
--
when
the
epa
speaks,
the
epa's
rule
will
displace
the
federal
common
law.
we're
talking
entirely--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--if
--
it
would
presumably
provide
a
basis
for
the
defendant
to
go
back
to
the
court
and
--
and
vacate
the
judgment
or
alter
the
judgment
to
comply
with
regulations,
should
that
happen.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
what
appellate
courts
are
here
for,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
continuing
validity
of
the
injunction
it
entered
previously
because
once
the
epa--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--on
a
different
litigation
track,
it
is
--
would
also
be
possible
to
challenge
the
epa's
regulatory
judgment,
but
in
the
case
in
which
a
judgment
had
already
been
entered,
it
is
the
ordinary
litigation
track
to,
if
--
if
intervening
events
make
equitable
relief
no
longer
equitable,
to
go
back
to
the
court
and
ask
the
court
to
modify
its
injunction.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
don't
think
it's
a
different
set
--
yes,
one
set
of
standards
for
reviewing
an
agency's
determination,
but
the
ultimate
standards
that
are
reached
are
going
to
be
a
level
of
emission
reduction
through
either
process.
when
the
agency
speaks
to
the
question,
the
federal
common
law
is
displaced.
when
it
doesn't,
and
during
what
could
be
a
long
period
of
time
when
it
doesn't,
the
states
are
entitled
to
a
federal
law
governing
their
dispute.
so
we
urge
this
court
to
keep
the
federal
courts
open
to
states
exercising
their
historic
power
to
protect
their
land
and
their
citizens
from
air
pollution
emitted
in
other
states.
