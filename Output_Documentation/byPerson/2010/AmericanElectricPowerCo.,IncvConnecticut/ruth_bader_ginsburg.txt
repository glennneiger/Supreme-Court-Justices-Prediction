if
you
have
--
if
you
have
the
precedent
of
massachusetts
v.
epa
and
if
any
one
plaintiff
has
standing,
i
guess
that's
enough.
so
if
you
look
at
standing
alone,
it
seems
to
me
the
states
would
have
standing
on
the
same
basis
that
massachusetts
had
standing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
--
your
first
argument
when
you
addressed
this
issue
was
there
is
a
decisionmaker
and
that
decisionmaker
is
epa.
so
you
wouldn't
get
to
even
how
arduous
a
task
this
would
be
if
it
was
within
the
court's
bailiwick.
i
thought
your
position
was
that
the
function,
this
regulatory
function,
has
been
assigned
to
the
epa
and
not
to
the
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
epa
couldn't
give
--
could
epa
give
that
relief?
we're
dealing
with
existing
stationary
sources.
we're
not
dealing
with
new
or
modified
sources.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
more
than
that,
newdow
was
a
case
of
a
father
trying
to
assert
a
right
on
behalf
of
a
child,
and
the
child
herself
did
not
want
that
right
nor
did
her
mother.
so
it
seems
to
me
it's
worlds
apart,
and
when
you
describe
prudential
standing
as
involving
generalized
grievance,
i
thought
that
the
generalized
grievance
was
article
iii.
i
thought
that's
what
mrs.
frothingham's
case
was
about;
it
was
a
grievance
that
she
shared
with
everybody
in
the
populations,
so
she
didn't
have
standing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
that
extent
you
disagree
with
mr.
keisler
because
he
says
there
is
no
article
iii?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
get
to
--
to
the
situation
that
now
exists?
they
are
seeking
standards
for
existing
sources.
i
asked
mr.
keisler,
and
do
you
agree
with
him,
this
is
not
a
--
this
is
not
a
new
source
or
a
modified
source;
we're
talking
about
existing
sources.
does
epa,
could
epa,
regulate
and
set
standards
for
existing
sources?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
an
area
where
the
court
can't
go.
to
take
a
political
question
we
all
agree
on,
i
think,
the
courts
can't
mess
with
the
impeachment
of
a
president,
just
--
but
here
the
court
does
deal
with
the
subject
matter
all
the
time.
it
reviews
decisions
that
the
epa
has
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
underwood,
the
--
the
relief
that
you're
seeking,
asking
a
court
to
set
standards
for
emissions,
sounds
like
the
kind
of
thing
that
epa
does.
i
mean,
congress
set
up
the
epa
to
promulgate
standards
for
emissions,
and
now
what
--
the
relief
you're
seeking
seems
to
me
to
set
up
a
district
judge,
who
does
not
have
the
resources,
the
expertise,
as
a
kind
of
super
epa.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we
just
concentrate
on
i
think
the
relief
you
want,
you
say:
district
court,
if
we
pass
everything
else,
you
set
emissions
standards,
you
put
a
cap
immediately,
you
set
a
cap,
and
then
annually
you
require
further
reductions.
well,
that
just
sounds
to
me
like
what
epa
does
when
it
sets
emission
standards.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
agency
--
the
agency
is
engaged
in
that,
in
it
right
now,
and
that's
another
facet
of
this
case,
the
potential
for
conflict.
the
epa,
after
acting
for
a
while,
has
now
agreed
that
it
does
have
authority
to
classify
this
as
a
pollutant
and
it
has
taken
the
first
steps.
one
argument
that
the
epa
--
that
the
united
states
is
presenting
is
the
way
agencies
go
about
this
is
incrementally,
so
they're
starting
with
motor
vehicles
and
then
maybe
they
will
go
to
new
sources,
and
then
they'll
get
to
maybe
where
you
are.
but
you
want
the
court
to
start
with
the
existing
sources,
to
set
limits
that
may
be
in
conflict
with
what
an
existing
agency
is
doing.
do
we
ignore
the
fact
that
the
epa
is
there
and
that
it
is
regulating
in
this
area?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
point
is
that
epa,
unless
and
until
epa
gets
to
the
point
of
setting
standards
for
existing
sources,
the
court
can
be
side
by
side
with
the
agency;
we
know
that
the
agency
is
beginning,
it
starts
with
light
motor
vehicles,
and
then
it's
moving
forward.
but
you
say
as
long
as
the
epa
hasn't
gotten
to
stationary
sources,
the
court
can
be
conducting
a
similar
function
with
--
one
of
many
differences
is
that
if
the
epa
is
setting
the
standards
they
will
set
--
they
will
do
it
through
notice
and
comment,
everybody
will
be
able
to
put
in
a
submission;
but
the
court
substituting
for
the
epa,
how
does
the
court
replicate
that
notice
and
comment
process?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
there
is
an
agency,
and
we
know
that
it
operates
in
a
certain
way,
through
notice
and
comment
rulemaking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
here
is
the
court
and
how
does
it
operate
to
get
to
those
standards?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
aspect
of
the
litigation
process
as
opposed
to
the
agency
process,
the
agency
makes
its
rule
and
that
can
be
challenged
in
court,
but
suppose
your
plaintiffs
lost
this
case
on
merits.
i
take
it
this
is
not
a
class
action,
there's
no
certification
of
any
class.
other
plaintiffs
before
another
district
court
could
launch
a
similar
action
against
these
very
same
defendants,
right?
there
would
be
nothing
to
preclude
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
means
you
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
federal
common
law
of
public
nuisance
authorize
suits
by
states,
cities
and
private
parties
to
abate
carbon
dioxide
emissions
on
the
theory
that
they
contribute
to
global
warming?
that
is
the
question
this
case
presents.
the
plaintiffs
below,
respondents
here,
several
states
new
york
city
and
three
private
land
trusts,
the
defendants
below,
petitioners
here,
are
five
major
electric
power
companies
including
the
federal
tennessee
valley
authority,
alleging
that
the
five
power
companies
of
the
largest
emitters
of
carbon
dioxide
in
the
nation,
the
plaintiffs
filed
suit
for
injunctive
relief
in
the
federal
district
court
in
new
york.
they
asked
the
court
to
set
carbon
dioxide
emissions
limits
for
each
defendant
at
an
initial
cap
and
to
order
further
reductions
annually.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
litigation
holding
that
the
plaintiffs
had
come
to
the
wrong
forum.
they
were
raising
political
questions
the
judge
said,
this
is
properly
address
by
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
of
government
not
by
the
judiciary.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed.
the
appeals
court
held
first
that
neither
the
political
question
doctrine
nor
any
article
iii
standing
to
sue
barrier
blocked
the
litigation.
on
the
merits,
the
second
circuit
held
that
the
litigation
could
move
forward
in
federal
court
because
the
plaintiffs
had
stated
the
claim
under
federal
common
law
that
is
law
developed
by
judges'
overtime
case
by
case.
in
reaching
this
determination,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
decisions
of
this
court
allowing
the
state
to
maintain
the
suit
for
abatement
of
air
pollution
emanating
from
outside
the
state
but
traveling
into
it.
on
the
jurisdictional
question,
this
court
is
evenly
divided.
four
of
us
would
find
no
threshold
barrier
to
sue
while
four
withhold
that
the
plaintiffs
lack
article
iii
standing
to
sue.
we
therefore
follow
our
standard
practice
on
four-to-four
splits.
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
exercise
of
jurisdiction
but
we
issue
no
opinion
on
the
point
and
our
disposition
of
the
question
carries
no
weight
as
precedent.
on
the
merits
however,
we
reverse
the
second
circuit's
judgment.
we
did
not
decide
whether
this
court's
reasoning
in
prior
interstate
business
suits
would
carry
over
to
a
claim
seeking
abatement
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions
for
any
such
claim
we
hold
would
be
displaced
by
the
clean
air
act.
the
justification
for
federal
common
law
disappears,
our
decisions
explained
when
congress
steps
in
and
addresses
the
question
until
then
prop
of
a
federal
common
law
governments.we
think
this
case
fits
that
description.
in
massachusetts,
the
epa,
we
held
that
the
clean
air
act
entrusted
regulation
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions
to
an
expert
administrative
agency,
the
environmental
protection
agency,
the
epa's
authority
under
the
clean
air
act,
which
is
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
power
plants
like
those
the
defendants
operate.
in
fact,
the
epa
is
currently
engaged
in
the
rulemaking
to
decide
whether
the
agency
should
set
limits
on
emissions
from
domestic
power
plants.
the
clean
air
act
in
our
judgment
leaves
no
room
for
a
parallel
tract
--
track
that
is
notwithstanding
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
expert
agency,
control
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
federal
judges
employing
judge
made
federal
tort
law.
we
have
before
us
to
put
it
plainly,
who
decides
question
executive
agency
pursuant
to
congressional
delegation
or
court?
the
second
circuit
held
that
federal
common
law
is
not
displaced
unless
and
until
the
epa
actually
exercises
this
regulatory
authority
by
setting
limits
on
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
the
defendants'
plants.
we
disagree.
the
critical
point
is
that
congress
has
vested
decision
maker
--
decision
making
authority
in
the
epa.
if
the
plaintiffs
are
dissatisfied
with
the
epa's
decision,
the
plaintiffs
may
seek
court
review
of
the
agencies
rulemaking
under
procedures
prescribed
by
the
clean
air
act.
but
the
plaintiffs
cannot
bypass
the
epa's
rulemaking
and
activate
in
the
first
instance
judicial
resolution
of
the
matter.
the
plaintiff's
also
raised
claims
under
state
tort
law.
the
courts
below
did
not
address
the
potential
governance
of
state
law
because
we
are
a
court
of
review.
in
that
first
view,
we
remand
the
state
law
claims
so
that
the
lower
courts
can
take
them
up
in
the
first
instance.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
justice
sotomayor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
