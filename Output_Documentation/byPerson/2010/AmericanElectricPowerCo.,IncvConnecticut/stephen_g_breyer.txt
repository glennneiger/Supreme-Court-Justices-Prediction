can
the
courts
set
a
tax?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
suppose
cost-effective
--
suppose
your
complaint
is
the
same
but
you
alleged,
what
i
get
from
reading
these
might
be
the
best
way
to
deal
with
the
problem.
i
would
like
the
court
to
impose
a
tax
of
$20
a
ton
on
carbon,
right?
and
we
bring
all
the
polluters
in,
and
the
same
injury
that
you
have,
everything's
the
same,
you
have
14
experts
who
say
this
is
how
to
get
it
done.
it's
cost-effective,
it
will
lead
to
substitution,
it
will
actually
bring
about
a
world
without
global
warming,
and
so
let's
do
it.
now,
does
the
district
judge,
in
your
opinion,
have
the
power
to
enter
that
order?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
now
next
question
is
going
to
be,
if
he
does
not
have
the
power
to
enter
that
order,
which
could
be
proved
to
be
extremely
effective,
and
least
possible
harm
to
the
consumer,
why
does
he
have
the
power
to
enter
the
order
you
want?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
this
will.
this
is
addressed
to
that.
it
says
abate
the
nuisance,
here's
how
you're
going
to
do
it.
you're
going
to
put
a
$20
a
tax
ton
on
carbon,
and
lo
and
behold,
you
will
discover
that
nuisance
will
be
abated.
and
we
bring
in
15
economists.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
is
it
less
intrusive--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
try
to
get
into
the
details
of
how
an
electricity
company
will
in
fact
run
its
operation,
than
to
say
all
you
have
to
do
is
make
a
change
in
the
dollar
sign
that
you
charge
for
your
product?
