mr.
shah,
you
might
want
to
make
your
third
point.
you
said
you
had
three
points
preliminarily,
so
why
don't
you
make
your
third
point
and
then
respond
to
the
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shah,
you
don't
have
to
take
a
position
on
that,
because
you
don't
represent
a
private
trustee.
and
the
government
can
accept
arguendo
that
there
would
be
such
a
relationship,
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to
defend
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shah--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
one
--
is
one
of
them
shielding
government
actors?
i
mean,
from
what
you
said
so
far,
on
the
one
hand
you
recognize
that
it
is
what
we
call
a
guardian,
the
guardian-ward
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
tribe.
but
what
you
seem
to
be
suggesting
is
that
the
government
has
a
dual
focus,
and
one
is
its
guardianship
relation
to
the
tribe,
but
the
other
is
these
are
government
actors
and
the
government
is
also
interested
in
shielding
its
actors.
is
that
--
is
that
it
or
is
it
a
more
nebulous
interest?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
--
how
many
of
these
mismanagement
suits
are
there?
do
you
have
any
estimate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gordon--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
riggs
--
you
said
riggs
was
a
case
where
the
trust
fund
paid
the
lawyer,
and
the
court
distinguished
cases
where
that
wasn't
so,
where
the
trustee
was
paying
the
lawyer
for
the
trustee's
own
protection,
and
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
we
are
dealing
with
a
case
where
the
lawyer
is
paid
out
of
trust
funds.
in
riggs,
the
--
seminal
case,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
make
a
distinction,
i
--
i
take
it,
between
attorney-client
privilege
and
work
product.
initially,
you
were
seeking
both
on
the
theory
that
the
tribe
is
in
fact
the
client,
but
apparently
you
are
not
pressing
that
point
any
more
about
work
product?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government
is
maintaining
throughout
that
it
wears
two
hats.
on
the
one
hand
it
is
a
guardian
or
a
trustee,
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
the
sovereign.
so
it's
the
latter,
the
government's
claim
that
it
is
the
sovereign,
that
makes
the
difference,
it's
not
the--
