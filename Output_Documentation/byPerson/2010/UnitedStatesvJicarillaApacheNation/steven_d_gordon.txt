mr.
steven
d.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
jicarilla
apache
nation
has
sued
the
government
for
mismanaging
millions
of
dollars
of
its
trust
monies.
no
trustee
in
this
situation,
including
the
government,
is
entitled
to
withhold
the
legal
advice
that
it
has
received
about
managing
the
beneficiary's
money.
the
beneficiary
is
entitled
to
see
that
legal
advice,
so
that
it
can
determine
whether
the
trustee
followed
the
advice.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i
--
i
--
i
do
not
--
i
do
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
the
--
the
notion
of
--
the
issue
here
is
an
issue
of
evidence,
and
it
is
controlled
by
federal
rule
501,
which
specifies
that
federal
courts
that
resolve
claims
of
privilege
based
on
common
law
principles.
under
the
common
law,
a
trustee
cannot
assert
the
attorney-client
privilege
to
withhold
from
a
fiduciary
legal
advice
about
management
of
the
trust.
that,
i
submit,
is
the
end
of
the
analysis.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
your
honor,
there
are
very
--
there
are
a
handful
of
states
that
have
not
recognized
the
fiduciary
exception,
but
there
is
no
federal
circuit
that
has
refused
to
recognize
it.
indeed,
all
of
the
federal
circuits
that
have
considered
it
have
adopted
it,
and
it
is
recognized
in
both,
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
the
restatement
of
trusts
and
the
restatement
of
the
law
governing
lawyers.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
justice
scalia,
i
--
i
cannot
cite
a
specific
case--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--but
that's
not
correct,
if
--
if
i
may,
mr.
justice.
if
you
look
at
the
seminal
american
decision,
the
riggs
bank
decision
that's
cited
in
both
briefs,
they
talk
about
the
rationales
and
they
said
that
the
first
rationale
is
that
the
trustee
acts
as
a
proxy
for
the
beneficiary
in
obtaining
the
advice.
the
second
rationale
is
that
the
trustee
has
a
general
duty
to
disclose
relevant
information
to
the
beneficiary.
the
court
mentioned
that
one
factor
that
it
would
look
at
was
who
had
paid
for
the
legal
advice,
but
it
did
not
suggest
that
that
was
determinative,
and
indeed
subsequent
case
law
has
made
clear
that
it
is
not,
and
the
restatement
says
explicitly
that
who
paid
is
not
the
controlling
factor.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
not
that
i
can
cite
right
now.
but
it
would
be--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--yes,
your
honor.
but
the
issue
--
this
is,
i
submit,
letting
the
tail
wag
the
dog.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
money
that
belongs
to
the
beneficiary.
we're
talking
about
money.
we're
not
talking
about
a
bare
trust.
we're
talking
about
a
full-fledged
trust
under
mitchell
2.
indeed,
this
court
in
mitchell
2
said
that
trusts
involving
the
management
of
indian
money
were
full-fledged
trusts.
and
in
that
situation
for
the
government
to
say
that,
while
any
private
fiduciary
would
be
obliged
to
show
to
the
beneficiary
the
legal
advice
it's
received
when
there's
an
issue
about
whether
it's
fulfilled
its
fiduciary
duties,
it's
different
because
we've
spent
our
hard-earned
money
on
these
lawyers
and
we
own
the
records
in
issue.
i
mean,
that
doesn't
make
sense.
and
basically
as
a
matter
of
discovery,
which
is
where
we
are
right
now,
the
posture
of
the
case,
whenever
you
seek
discovery,
in
virtually
all
of
those
circumstances
the
documents
in
issue
are
going
to
belong
to
the
opposing
party.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
right.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
my
response
to
that
would
be
twofold,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
that
same
argument
can
be
made
for
any
private
fiduciary,
yet
the
courts
have
felt
that
the
more
important
relationship
is
the
relationship
between
the
trustee
and
the
beneficiary,
that
that
trumps
the
need
for
or
the
desirability
for
private
discussions
between
the--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--right.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
well,
if
it's
never
shared,
your
honor,
then
it
leaves
it
at
the
option
of
the
trustee
to
selectively
waive
the
privilege
when
it's
to
its
advantage
in
a
breach
of
trust
suit.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i
think
the
issue,
your
honor,
is
whether
that,
in
fact,
is
what
the
trustee
is
seeking.
if
the
trustee
is
seeking
advice
about
personal
liability,
then
i
certainly
agree
that
the
trustee
could
do
that.
if
the
trustee
instead
is
seeking
advice,
regardless
of
who
pays
for
it,
but
is
seeking
legal
advice
about
how
the
trustee
should
manage
money
belonging
to
the
beneficiary--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
submit
that
the
whole
issue
is
if
there
is
a
suit
for
breach
of
trust,
which
is
the
precondition
for
all
of
this,
whether
in
that
circumstance
the
trustee
is
obliged
to
produce
the
legal
advice
that
it
has
received
so
the
beneficiary
can
be--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
the
position.
and
that
puts
the
government
in
no
different
position
than
private
beneficiaries
or
erisa
beneficiaries
or
any
other
sorts
of
beneficiaries.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
justice
kennedy,
let
me
respond
to
that.
and
i
agree
that
who
is
paying
for
it
--
if
the
trustee
is
paying
for
it
out
of
his
own
or
her
own
pocket,
that
is
a
factor
that
certainly
should
be
looked
at
and
would
be
entitled
to
--
to
some
weight
in
terms
of
what
the
purpose
of
the
advice
was
for;
but
ultimately
the
issue
is
whether
the
trustee
is
seeking
to
protect
personal
interests,
protect
against
a
claim
of
liability,
for
example,
or
whether
is
--
the
trustee
is
looking
for
advice
about
how
to
manage
the
beneficiary's
money.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
it
focuses
on
how
to
manage
it
properly,
then
--
and
it's
prospective,
then
i
think
that
the
--
it
--
it
is
not
privileged.
if,
instead,
you
posit,
you
know,
this
is
what
i
did
and
i'm
concerned
i
may
have
screwed
up,
do
you
think
i'm
liable,
then
i
think
a
different
answer
may
obtain.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
please
tell
me
what
to
do,
yes.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
well,
your
honor,
i
agree
preventative
advice
is
the
most
--
is
among
the
most
important
one
can
give.
but
why
should
the
government
be
in
a
different
position
with
regard
to
this
than
the
private
beneficiary?
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
your
honor,
the
court
said
in
the
sears
decision,
which
is
the
cited
in
our
brief
--
i
believe
it's
in
footnote
16
--
that
citizens'
access
rights
under
foia
are
not
necessarily
coextensive
with--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--that,
your
honor,
and
also
the
fundamental--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--right.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i
would
say--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
this
court's
decision
in
julian,
where
it
said
that
different
classes
of
persons
may
have
different
rights
under
foia
--
the
right
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
right
of
the
beneficiaries.
we're
not
talking
about
the
citizen's
right
to
see
how
indian
trust
monies
have
been
managed.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
but
i
believe
that
under
the
precedent
in
julian,
that
it
would
be
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
access
to
indians
whose
money
is
being
managed.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
well,
your
honor,
again
i
come
back
that
the
trustee
is
entitled
where
the
issue
is
liability,
rather
than
how
to
manage
the
money.
the
--
that
gets
into
an
area
that
would
not
be
subject
to
the
fiduciary
exceptions.
so
if
that
is
the
focus
of
the
advice,
a
private
beneficiary
wouldn't
have
to
give
up
that
advice
and
we
don't
contend
that
the
government
should,
either.
but
where,
as
here,
all
of
the
documents
are
general
documents
that
deal
generally
with
how
to
manage
indian
trust
funds--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--well,
your
honor,
at
--
at
some
logical
level
there
is
a
link
there
that
can
never
be
severed,
but
i
submit,
respectfully,
that
the
government,
when
it's
getting
advice
about
managing
trust
funds,
is
not
really
focused
on
its
liability.
the
government's
liability,
after
all,
is
much
more
circumscribed
than
private
fiduciaries,
in
any
number
of
ways.
it
is
seeking
legal
advice
about
what
is
the
proper
way
to
invest,
can
we
do
this,
can
we
pool
funds,
can
we
do
--
you
know,
can
we
make
a
certain
type
of
investment
or
is
it
prohibited
to
us.
and
advice
of
that
nature
is
advice
to
which
the
beneficiary
is
entitled.
a
private
beneficiary
--
the
beneficiaries
of
private
trusts
are
entitled,
and
indians,
whose
money
is
being
managed
because
the
government
has
taken
on
itself
by
statute
and
said,
we
are
going
to
take
control
of
your
monies
and
we're
going
to
manage
them,
have
no
lesser
right
to
get
access
to
this
highly
relevant
information
when
they
litigate
for
breach
of
trust.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
in
fact,
your
honor,
there
is
some
case
law
that
says
the
fiduciary
exception
can
be
applied
to
--
to
work
product.
we
did
not
press
that
point
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
we
--
focused
our
request
for
documents
on
attorney-client,
not
on
work
product.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
yes,
your
honor,
which
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
the
court
of
federal
claims
reviewed
all
of
the
documents
in
camera
and
made
a
document-by-document
determination,
which
is,
of
course,
the
standard
approach
when
you're
talking
about
attorney-client
privilege.
it's
done
on
a
document
by
document
basis.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
it
didn't
come
up,
your
honor,
because
there
weren't
any
retrospective
wants.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
they're
all
prospective,
your
honor.
they're
all
prospective.
the--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--yes,
your
honor.
the
--
i
want
to
pick
up,
i
believe
it
was
on
a
comment
that
you
made,
justice
sotomayor,
when
you
said
that
under
the
government's
theory
there
would
be
no
need
for
rule
501.
and
indeed,
they
say
that
it's
not
enough.
501
on
its
face
says
apply
common
law
principles.
and
the
government's
argument
is
that's
not
enough
unless
there's
some
other
statute
that
requires
common
law
principles
to
be
applied
to
this.
now,
this
is
a
neat
trick.
you
just
read
501
out
of
the
rules
of
evidence
when
it
comes
to
the
government,
notwithstanding
that
501
itself
says
it's
to
be
used
to
determine
privilege
claims
by
the
government,
and
that's
reinforced
in
federal
rule
of
evidence
1101,
which
specifically
says
that
the
rules
of
evidence
are
to
apply
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
your
honor,
it
--
i
think
that
that
could
pick
up
on
the
same
distinction
that
the
court
has
already
drawn
in
mitchell
1
and
mitchell
2,
between
bare
trust
and
a
full-fledged
trust.
the
government
may
have
a
general
duty
to
act
in
the
interests
of
all
citizens.
indeed,
i
think
we
would
all
agree
with
that.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
government
is
engaging
in
the
conduct
of
a
full-fledged
trust
with
respect
to
citizens.
it's
not.
its
relationship
to
citizens
day
in
and
day
out
is
akin
to,
in
fact
maybe
even
a
level
below,
the
bare
trust
relationship
that
was
at
issue
in
mitchell
1.
so,
we're
not
proposing
a
--
a
sweeping
new
rule
here.
it's
the
government
that's
proposing
to
transform
this
court's
jurisprudence
about
indians,
because
the
notion
that
the
only
enforceable
obligations
it
has
are
those
set
forth
in
statute
or
regulation,
were
the
court
to
adopt
that,
it
would
be
overruling
its
decision
in
white
mountain
apache.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
well,
the
--
the
principal
one
we
could
find,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
is
with
respect
to
government
retirees
who
make
voluntary
contributions
to
their
fund,
and
the
government's
argument
here
could
be
applied
to
them.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
yes,
your
honor,
and
i'm
happy
for
it
to
be.
i
believe
it
should
be.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
yes.
i
might
add,
your
honor,
fortunately
it's
not
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
that
runs
that.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
your
honor,
no,
frankly
it
hasn't
come
up
that
much
with
--
in
terms
of
federal
retirees.
there's
the
cavanaugh
v.
wainstein
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
which
is
about
the
only
published
decision
i've
been
able
to
find.
the
fact
of
the
matter,
i
--
i
was
being
humorous
a
moment
ago,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
government
retirement
funds
have
been,
it
appears,
run
quite
well
and
there
have
been
relatively
few
claims
brought
against
them.
there's
a
reason
that
there
are
a
bunch
of
pending
cases
regarding
indian--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--that's
the
julian
case,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i'm
sorry,
it's
not
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i
will
--
it
--
486
u.s.
1,
1988,
your
honor.
the
--
there
is
another
inconsistency
in
the
government's
position
here
that
i
would
like
to
highlight
for
the
court,
if
i
may.
that
is
this:
the
government
relies
on
the
common
law
in
the
first
place
to
say
it
has
a
privilege.
there's
no
statute
that
gives
the
government
attorney-client
privilege.
so
it
relies
on
common
law
saying:
we
have
an
attorney-client
privilege.
now,
that's
fine
under
federal
rule
501.
but
the
government
says,
while
it
can
rely
on
common
law,
jicarilla
cannot
rely
on
that
same
common
law
to
establish
the
limits
on
the
privilege
it's
claiming.
this
court
described
that
sort
of
argument
as
"heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose.
"
and
said
that
it
can't
be
right.
and
i
submit
that
it
can't
be
right
here.
the--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--i
agree,
your
honor,
that
that's
their
claim.
but
the
government
hasn't
shown
how
the
fact
that
it
is
the
sovereign,
which
we
certainly
concede,
makes
any
meaningful
difference
for
purposes
of
the
issue
presented
here.
the
cases
it
cites
establish
that
the
government,
because
it
is
sovereign,
in
some
instances
has
broader
authority
than
a
private
trustee
would
to
help
out
the
beneficiary.
and
i
believe
that
that
is--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--well,
your
honor,
i
agree,
but
the
issue
of
conflicting,
competing
interests,
first
of
all
it
arises
in
the
private
trust
context
and
it
arises
frequently.
anytime
you've
got
a
life
beneficiary
and
a
remainderman,
you've
got
a
potential
conflict
between
the
beneficiaries;
and
this
issue
of
conflict
has
led
to
the
development
of
the
duty
of
impartiality
for
private
trustees;
and
it's
discussed
at
length
in
section
79
of
the
restatement.
so
the
notion
of
competing
interests
is
not
unique
to
the
government.
the
government
may
have
some
different
competing
interests
than
a
private
trustee
might
have.
that's
certainly
conceivable.
and
if
it
does,
the
existence
of
a
specific
competing
interest
may
affect
whether
the
action
that
the
government
takes
is
or
is
not
a
breach
of
trust.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
well,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
it's
not
totally--
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
--well,
your
honor,
you're
positing
that
the
trustee
has
a
personal
interest
that's
adverse
to
the
beneficiary.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
those
are
competing
responsibilities.
i
agree
that
the
government
may
have
that,
and
that
may
affect
whether
the
decision
that
they
ultimately
make
is
or
is
not
an
appropriate
decision.
but
it
does
not
affect
their
duty
to
disclose
as
a
matter
of
evidence
the
legal
advice
that
they
use
to
make
that
judgment.
the
beneficiary,
when
the
beneficiary's
money
is
at
stake,
is
entitled
to
see
what
advice
the
government
acted
on
in
dealing
with
its
money.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
i
submit
that
the
ultimate
balancing
of
interests
here
is
the
same
as
it
is
for
a
private
fiduciary.
there
is
no
--
the
court
--
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
that
under
rule
501
indian
tribes
are
entitled
to
the
same
evidence
as
other
trust
beneficiaries
about
how
their
money
was
managed.
that
is
our
request
of
this
court.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
i
think
that
may
in
a
theoretical
sense
be
true,
your
honor.
but
practically
speaking,
there's
a
difference
between
the
bia
officials
who
are
acting
as
the
trustee
and
the
attorneys
who
are
advising
the
trustee.
our
claim
is
against
the
trustee.
it's
not
against
the
attorneys.
we
are
not
seeking
to
impose
any
professional
responsibilities
on
the
government
attorneys.
mr.
steven
d.
gordon
thank
you.
