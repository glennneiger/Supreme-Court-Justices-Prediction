other
than
the
time
and
expense
of
going
through
voluminous
records,
which
is
obvious,
is
there
any
other
harm
to
the
government
in
being
required
to
show
that
there's
a
competing
interest
that
makes
disclosure
unnecessary
or
improper?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
hadn't
thought
about
your
argument
until
this
--
until
you
made
it
this
morning,
that
if
there
--
if
--
if
the
tribe
is
correct
that
it
owns
these
documents
and
gets
--
can
get
them
anytime,
but
the
--
the
--
the
trial
court
here
divided
the
documents
into
five
categories.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
to
some
of
those
categories
it
--
it
denied
--
it
denied
production.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
did
that
in
the
context
of
recognizing
the
attorney-client
privilege,
including
work
product,
which
were
the
accountant's
records.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
best
case
that
you
have
on
that
in
the
private
trustee
context?
i
had
thought
your
answer
was
going
to
be
that
in
that
case,
the
fact
that
the
payment
is
made
by
the
trustee
out
of
the
trustee's
own
funds
and
not
out
of
the
trust
funds
might
be
dispositive
and
might
give
him
the
privilege.
but
you
--
you
seem
to
say,
in
answer
to
the
questions
from
the
court,
that,
other
than
this
distinction
you
make
between
what
the
personal
liability
is
and
how
he
ought
to
manage
the
trust,
which
i
think
is
a
murky
distinction,
that
the
documents
have
to
be
disclosed.
what's
your
best
case
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
means
you
can't
get
preventative
advice,
which
is
one
of
the
most
important
kinds
of
advice
an
attorney
can
give.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
also
has
broader
authority,
and
that's
just
their
point,
i
take
it,
for
many
other
areas.
the
sovereign
can't
easily
divest
itself
of
its
responsibilities.
a
trustee
can
so
conform
and
shape
its
business
that
it
doesn't
have
conflicts.
a
government
just
can't
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
true
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
government
may
have
a
very
powerful
interest
in
seeking
neutral,
independent
advice
from
an
attorney,
and
that
were
you
to
prevail
that
advice
would
become
watered
down?
