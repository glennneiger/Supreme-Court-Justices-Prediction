g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
today
in
case
10-382,
united
states
v.
jicarilla
apache
nation.
mr.
shah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
shah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
gordon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
--
you
don't
doubt
that
in
this
context
sovereign
commands
would
trump
trustee
obligations,
do
you?
in
other
words,
if
congress--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
policy-based
and
i'm
concerned
about
the
policy
implications
of
your
position.
our
system
has
concluded
that
it
works
best
if
people
have
candid
advice
from
their
lawyers,
and
my
concern
here
is
if
you're
a
lawyer
--
you
are
a
lawyer
--
and
--
and
you're
asked
for
your
advice
by
a
trustee--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
if
you
know
that
that
is
going
to
be
shared
with
the
beneficiary,
you're
going
to
give
bland,
mushy,
hedging
advice
rather
than
direct
and
candid
advice
to
the
trustee,
because
it's
going
to
be
shared
more
widely
beyond
the
trustee.
and
that's
--
that
hurts
not
only
the
trustee,
but
also
the
beneficiaries,
whose
trustee
does
not
have
candid
legal
advice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
does
--
i
appreciate
the
point,
but
how
does
a
trustee
get
candid
legal
advice?
in
every
case,
isn't
the
--
the
lawyer
--
concerning
his
dealings
with
the
beneficiary,
with
the
trust:
i
don't
know
if
i
have
to
do
this
or
i
have
to
do
this.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
seems
to
me
if
the
--
if
the
information
is
always
going
to
be
shared
with
the
beneficiary,
the
trustee
is
always
going
to
get
hedged
advice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
always
a
question
of
liability.
if
he
messes
up
and
doesn't
manage
it
the
way
he's
supposed
to,
he
will
be
liable.
so
the
distinction
you
draw
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
workable
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i'm
the
trustee,
and
i
say
i
would
like
legal
advice
as
to
whether
i
should
renegotiate
this
lease
with
the
government.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
i
want
that
advice
so
i
manage
the
trust
correctly,
and
i'm
concerned
if
i
don't
manage
the
trust
correctly
i'm
going
to
be
sued.
now
is
the
document
from
the
lawyer
responding
to
that
inquiry
privileged
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
he
says
this
is
what
i
did
and
i
might
be
liable,
it's
privileged.
if
he
says
this
is
what
i'm
going
to
do--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
under
your
theory
if
there's
a
claim
of
privilege
on
--
on
--
on
the
government's
behalf,
presumably
the
district
court
would
conduct
an
in-camera
review
to
determine
whether
it
was
retrospective
for
liability
or
prospective
for
responsibility?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
--
they
could
be
retrospective,
too,
right?
the
government
exposes
itself
to
liability,
obviously,
in
these
areas
as
well.
that's
the
basis
for
your
suit,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
the
government
as
a
whole
has
an
obligation
to
act
in
the
best
interests
of
the
citizenry,
right?
why
doesn't
the
same
theory
apply
to
any
citizen?
look,
government,
you're
supposed
to
--
you're
acting
in
a
fiduciary
statute
--
status
with
respect
to
me.
you're
supposed
to
be
acting
in
my
best
interests.
if
you're
getting
advice
from
the,
you
know,
department
of
justice
about
what
to
do,
i'm
entitled
to
get
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
there
any
other
--
are
there
any
other
areas
in
which
the
government's
relationship
to
particular
groups
of
citizens
is
that
of
fiduciary
to
beneficiary?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
are
some
of
those?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
your
argument
could
be
applied
to
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
i'm
a
government
retiree,
i
have
the
ability
to
get
the
legal
advice
that
whoever
it
is
that
runs
that
trust
gets?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
trustee
i
guess
is
--
is
broadly
conceived
of
as
the
government?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
the
lawyer
working
for
the
trustee
then
a
trustee
too,
an
employee
of
the
trustee?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gordon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
shah,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
--
if
i
pay
--
if
i
pay
a
lawyer
to
prepare
a
document
for
me,
is
that
--
i
do
own
that
document
or
does
the
lawyer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
shah,
and
mr.
gordon.
the
case
is
submitted.
