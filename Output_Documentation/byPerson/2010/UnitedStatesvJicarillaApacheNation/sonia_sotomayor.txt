justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
all
of
the
statutes
relating
to
these
funds
use
the
word
"trust".
not
one
statute
defines
trust
and
says
in
any
way
this
is
not
a
fiduciary
relationship.
to
the
contrary,
in
fact,
most
of
the
statutes
require
what
would
be
consistent
with
fiduciary
obligations,
and
at
least
one
of
them
that
you
rely
on
says
"but
not
limited
to".
so
the
issue
before
us
doesn't
involve
a
competing
sovereign
interest
by
the
u.s.
you've
conceded
that
in
your
cert
petition.
the
circuit
below
said
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
is
an
independent
sovereign
issue
governing
the
u.s.
activities.
just
explain
to
me
what's
the
rationale
that
would
permit
a
trustee
of
a
trust
fund
to
withhold
from
the
beneficiary
the
kinds
of
documents
that
relate
to
the
management
of
the
fund?
if
the
funds
exist
for
the
benefit
of
the
indian
tribe,
why
aren't
they
entitled
to
management
documents?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
part
that
doesn't
make
--
that
you're
not
explaining.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
in
both
--
in
all
of
those
cases,
counsel,
it
was
a
limitation
related
to
competing
interests,
meaning
it
was
recognizing
that
there
are
potentially
moments
in
which
an
attorney
is
acting
both
in
the
interest
of
the
government
and
in
the
interest
of
the
tribe.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
was
a
jurisdictional
question,
not
a
question
with
respect
to
--
to
the
--
to
the
obligation.
you're
not
seriously
suggesting
that
if
you're
a
trustee
of
an
indian
fund
that
you
can
breach
your
fiduciary
duty
by
simply
not
exercising
care
in
your
investment
strategies.
so
some
form
of
--
of
duty
exists.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--from
the
common
law,
and
the
common
law
has
to
define
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
why
would,
if
it
imposes
those
duties,
protect
you
from
disclosing
items
that
might
--
attorney
confidences
that
go
to
that
very
act,
the
very
act
of
investing
in
the
way,
even
under
your
definition,
that
the
trust
requires
you
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
this
argument,
frankly,
would
be
--
we
wouldn't
have
any
need
for
501,
because
if
as
an
evidentiary
rule
the
government
is
always
different,
then
there
is
no
situation
in
which
fiduciary
duties
in
common
law
would
ever
exist.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
--
is
there
any
greater
value
to
a
fiduciary
duty
than
to
manage
the
account
for
the
benefit
of
the
beneficiary?
that's
the
very
essence
of
what
a
trust
means,
and
so
i'm
having
a
hard
time
understanding
not
a
competing
interest
situation
where
you're
addressing
a
different
statutory
requirement,
but
merely
--
and
that's
what
this
case
was
presented
as,
merely
the
management
of
the
trust.
so
what
you're,
it
seems
to
me,
you're
arguing
is
there
is
no
duty.
you're
saying
it's
all
defined
by
statute
only,
but
you're
rendering
--
there's
no
need
to
use
the
word
"trust"
because
it
wouldn't
be
a
trust.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
were
no
prospective,
is
that
--
did
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
aren't
you
confusing,
just
following
up
on
the
chief
justice's,
ownership
with
access?
foia
itself
doesn't
make
these
records
less
--
the
government
doesn't
own
them
less
merely
because
foia
requires
them
to
share
it
with
other
people.
so
the
ownership
interest
is
not
the
defining
legal
obligation.
