mr.
pratik
a.
shah
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
relying
on
common
law
trust
principles
applicable
to
private
fiduciaries,
the
federal
circuit
imposed
on
the
united
states
a
duty
to
disclose
attorney-client
privileged
communications
to
an
indian
tribe.
that
abrogation
of
the
privilege
should
be
reversed
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
reflecting
the
sovereign
nature
of
the
united
states
function,
the
indian
trust
context
lacks
the
factors
essential
to
recognition
of
a
private
trust
fiduciary
exception.
unlike
in
a
private
trust,
government
attorneys
and
other
federal
officials
owe
an
exclusive
duty
of
loyalty
to
the
united
states,
not
to
the
beneficiary.
the
government
pays
the
cost
of
trust
administration
out
of
appropriated
funds,
not
out
of
the
trust
corpus.
the
government,
not
the
trust,
owns
the
resulting
record,
and
the
release
of
such
governmental
record,
including
to
a
tribe
or
individual
indian,
is
governed
by
specific
statutes
and
regulations
as
well
as
the
freedom
of
information
act,
not
the
common
law.
second,
the
decision
below
conflicts
with
this
court's
precedents
that
distinguish
the
united
states
from
a
private
trustee
and
that
reject
enforcement
of
duties
governing
the
administration
of
indian
property
that
are
not
set
forth
by
specific
statute
or
regulation.
the
fiduciary
exception
to
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
premised
on
a
private
trustee's
general
common
law
duty
to
disclose
trust
information,
but
no
statute
or
regulation
imposes
such
a
duty
on
the
united
states.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
okay--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--sure,
your
honor.
the
third
point
is
that
the
federal
circuit's
decision
poses
serious
practical
problems
for
the
government
because
the
general
common
law
duty
to
disclose
which
undergirds
the
fiduciary
exception
extends
to
all
trust
information
without
regard
to
the
existence
of
litigation;
excepting
it
implies
a
broad
and
burdensome
disclosure
obligation.
for
example,
there
are
over
300,000
individual
account
holders,
individual
indian
account
holders
on
top
of
the
tribal,
tribal
account
holders.
if
this
court
were
to
accept
the
fiduciary
exception
and
thereby
ratify
the
underlying
rationale,
presumably
then
any
one
of
those
or
all
of
those
300-plus
thousand
individual
account
holders
could
simply
call
up
the
interior
department
and
request
all
related
trust
records
outside
of
the
existing
statutory
and
regulatory
regime.
now,
justice
sotomayor,
let
me
turn
back
to
your
set
of
questions,
and
let
me
start
with
the
first
point
that
you
made,
which
is
the
statutes
here
use
the
term
trust;
why
doesn't
that
connote
some
sort
of
broad
fiduciary
relationship?
this
court
has
made
clear
in
its
precedents,
and
it
dates
back
to
the
mitchell
1,
the
first
decision
in
mitchell
case,
where
congress's
use
of
the
term
"trust",
the
court
said,
does
not
imply
the
full
gamut
of
common
law
fiduciary
obligations.
the
dissent
made
precisely
--
the
dissent
in
mitchell
made
precisely
the
argument
that
you're
sketching
out
here,
which
is
when
congress
uses
a
term
like
trust,
we
would
naturally
assume
that
it
implies
fiduciary
obligations.
the
majority
in
mitchell
rejected
that
notion,
and
in
fact
in
mitchell
2
in
the
navajo
nation
decisions,
the
court
has
continued
to
reject
that
proposition.
but
more
--
more
than
as
a
matter
of
precedent
i
think
that
makes--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--justice
sotomayor,
with
respect,
there
is
no
competing
interest
that
i'm
aware
of
that
were
mentioned
in
--
in
the
mitchell
decisions,
mitchell
1,
mitchell
2,
or
even
the
navajo
nation
decision.
those
were
simply
--
in
mitchell
1
it
was
the
indian
general
allotment
act,
which
said
that
the
united
states
"shall
hold
in
trust"
land
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
the
argument
made
by
the
tribe
in
that
case
and
by
the
dissenters
in
the
court
was
when
the
court
said
you
shall
hold
the
land
in
trust,
that
implies
certain
management
and
other
responsibilities
for
resources
related
to
that
land.
this
court
said
no,
when
congress
uses
the
term
"trust"
in
the
indian
context,
that
there
must
be
specific
statutory
regulatory
duties
that
the
court
sets
out.
let
me
explain--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--sure,
and
let
me--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
i
agree
everything
up
to
the
point
when
you
said
we
go
to
the
common
law.
of
course
there
would
be
in
this
context
some
enforceable
duties
with
respect
to
investment
of
the
funds
held
in
trust,
and
that's
because
the
relevant
statutes,
section
161a
and
162a,
set
forth
specific
investment
duties
that
the
government
must
comply
with.
now,
as
to
your
other
point,
that
mitchell
1
and
the
navajo
nation--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--a
couple
responses,
your
honor.
the
--
the
two
statutes
that
you're
talking
about,
161a
and
162a,
set
forth
specific
investment
duties.
they
don't
say
anything
about
disclosure.
the
1994
act
does
set
forth
some
disclosure
obligations,
but
they
are
extremely
discrete.
there
are
essentially
two
disclosure
obligations
that
all
of
these
statutes
together
impose.
the
--
the
united
states
must
provide
an
account
statement,
a
quarterly
account
statement;
and
the
united
states
must
provide
the
--
the
indian
tribes
and
individual
indians
an
annual
audit.
that
is
the
extent
of
disclosure
obligations
that
congress
has
set
forth
and
that
the
interior
department
by
regulation
has
implemented.
now,
to
the
--
to
the
extent
that
your
question
suggests
that
the
tribes
may
need
more
in
order
to
enforce
those
enforcement
duties,
i
think
the
--
the
account
statements
and
the
annual
audit
goes
a
long
way
towards
suggesting
that
if
there
is
a
problem,
then
the
tribe
may
want
to
try
to
enforce
those
duties.
the
other
point
i
would
make
is,
although
the
legally
enforceable
duties
under
this
court's
decisions
in
mitchell
and
navajo
nation
are
those
set
forth
by
statute
and
regulation,
that
doesn't
mean
the
interior
department
doesn't
have
discretion
to
provide
more
information.
and
in
fact,
in
practice,
the
interior
department
does
provide
a
much
broader
swath
of
information
to
the
indian
tribes
regarding
these
accounts
than
the
two
discrete
pieces
of
information
that
the
statutes
set
forth.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
the
united
states
does
not
contest
the
existence
of
a
fiduciary
exception
in
certain
private
trust
contexts
where
the
criteria
for
that
exception
are
satisfied.
so
the
answer
is
no,
we
don't,
we
don't
dispute
the
existence
in
certain
contexts
under
certain
circumstances
of
a
fiduciary
exception.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
for
example,
if
it
were
a
private
trust
and
the
factors
that
--
in
which
the
courts,
the
old
english
cases,
for
example,
have
recognized
where
the
fiduciary
exception
applies,
that
is
the
information
is
sought
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
beneficiary,
the
expenses
for
that
legal
advice
are
paid
out
of
the
trust
corpus,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
resulting
legal
advice
and
the
resulting
records
belong
to
the
trust
corpus.
all
of
those
things
give
right,
as
the
old
english
cases
say,
give
right
to
a
common
law
right
of
access
for
the
beneficiary
to
access
those.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
absolutely,
the
court
need
not
decide
that
question
in
order
to
reach
the
question.
the
court
can
assume
it
arguendo
and
then
go
forward.
i
think
the
critical
point
here
is,
though,
that
all
of
the
factors
that
underlie
that
--
that
exception
in
the
private
trustee
concept
are
absent
here.
here
the
government
is
acting
out
of
its
own
interest.
it
is
paying
for
the
legal
advice
out
of
congressional
appropriations.
the
government
owns
the
records
at
issue
by
virtue
of
the
federal
records
act,
by
virtue
of
interior
department
regulations,
which
are
cited
in
the
back
of
our
brief
make
very
clear
that
the
government
owns
these
records,
and
because
they
are
governmental
records
their
disclosure
is
not
governed
by
the
common
law.
there
is
a
highly--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--sure.
let
me
provide
two
responses,
justice
alito.
first,
i
think
as
a
formal
position
i
don't
think
our
position
turns,
as
a
formal
matter,
on
the
existence
of
a
specific
competing
duty.
i
think
such
a
rule
would
overlook
the
ways
in
which
the
u.s.
inherently,
united
states
inherently
differs
from
a
private
trustee.
and
i
think
that's
especially
true
in
the
light
of
the
complex
multifaceted
ways
in
which
the
government
interacts
with
indians
and
indian
tribes.
those
sovereign
obligations
extend
to
law
--
providing
law
enforcement,
educational
duties,
health
services.
one
subset
of
those
duties
are
the
type
of
trust
responsibilities
at
issue
in
this
case.
now,
to
be
more
concrete,
i
think,
even
putting
aside
that
larger
framework
which
may
create
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
with
--
and
the
indian
tribes
in
certain
circumstances,
i
think
even
in
the
trust
fund,
purely
in
the
trust
fund
context
that
we're
talking
about,
there
could
be
at
least
tensions
that
arise.
for
example,
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
cobell
case
when
it
talked
about
the
accounting
obligation
that
it
imposed
on
the
government,
it
made
clear
that
it's
not
the
same
accounting
obligation
that
would
apply
at
common
law.
and
the
reason
the
d.c.
circuit
gave
was
because
the
united
states
would
be
taking
that
--
performing
that
obligation
at
the
expense
of
taxpayers.
there
are
budgetary
constraints
that
the
united
states
must
take
into
consideration
as
a
sovereign.
maybe
that's
not
a
specific
competing
obligation
in
the
formal
sense,
but
i
think
it's
--
it's
a
factor
that
distinguishes
the
united
states
from
a
private
fiduciary.
also,
there
are
--
for
example
in
our
brief
we
discuss
one
of,
just
as
an
example,
one
of
the
documents
at
issue
in
this
case,
which
involves
a
judgment
by
a
tribal
court
seeking
to
attach
funds
from
an
individual
indian
money
account.
the
united
states
acts
as
a
trustee
with
respect
to
that
individual
--
indian
account.
it
may
be
the
case
that
the
united
states
consistent
with
its
fiduciary
obligations
in
that
sense
could
simply
pay
out
the
judgment,
but
i
think
there
would
be
room
for
the
united
states
to
take
a
closer
look
at
the
judgment,
to
make
sure
that
it
complies
with,
for
example,
the
indian
civil
rights
act
or
basic
due
process--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--yes,
your
honor.
we
do
not--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
think
the
response
is,
your
honor,
is
that
the
situation
will
never
be
identical
to
the
hypothetical
you
posed
because
the
government
inherently
differs,
and
let
me
set
out--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--to
be
clear,
justice
sotomayor,
the
government
is
not
arguing
that
no
common
law
exception
to
the
attorney-client
privilege
can
apply
to
the
government
or
that
federal
rule
501,
federal
rule
of
evidence
501
is
otherwise
inapplicable.
we're
making
a
much
more
limited
argument
that
this
particular
common
law
fiduciary
exception
is
not
applicable
to
the
government,
and
that
is
because
the
premise
of
that
fiduciary
exception
does
not
apply.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
those
two
things
are
inconsistent.
the
fact
that
we
don't
look
to
the
common
law
to
fill
in
all
of
the
duties
doesn't
mean
that
the
government
doesn't
have
duties
in
this
context.
it
has
very
specific
duties,
to
invest
the
funds
properly,
to
invest
the
funds
as
set
forth
in
the
statutes.
what
this
court
has
said
could
not
be
done
is
to
look
at
the
general
common
law
to
create
obligations
on
the
government.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
sure.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
okay.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
okay.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
a
couple
of
reasons,
your
honor.
first,
as
this
court
recognized,
starting
back
in
1912
in
the
heckman
case,
and
reiterated
in
the
candelaria
and
minnesota
cases
after
that,
is
that
the
united
states
is
not
acting
simply
out
of
the
beneficiary's
interests.
so
in
the
hypothetical,
the
original
hypothetical
that
you
posed
in
the
corporation
or
the
bank
that
was
acting
as
a
trustee,
there
the
trustee
is
simply
acting
out
of
its
fiduciary
obligation
solely
to
benefit
the
beneficiary.
that
is
not
how
the
governments
work.
as
this
court
made
clear,
the
government
is
acting
not
out
of
the
beneficiary's
interests,
it
is
acting
out
of
its
own
sovereign
interest
in
managing
the
statutes
and
regulations
that
govern
the
administration
of
indian
property.
that's
a
fundamental
difference.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
sure.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
we
would
still
win,
and
here's
why.
the
factors
that
--
even
assuming
a
common
law
trustee,
the
fiduciary
exception
doesn't
apply
automatically
at
all
common
law
trustees.
there's
several
things
that
underlie
that
fiduciary
exception.
one,
the
--
the
--
the
advice
sought
is
typically
paid
for
out
of
the
trust
corpus,
and
as
a
result
of
that
fact,
the
trust
itself
owns
the
records.
those
are
the
principal
two
factors
that
the
cases
recognizing
a
fiduciary
exception
rely
upon
to
create
a
common
law
right
of
access
of
the
beneficiary
to
such
records.
none
of
those
factors
are
present
here.
the
government
pays
for
these
--
for
--
for
the
cost
of
administration,
including
legal
advice,
out
of
congressionally
appropriated
funds.
the
records
resulting
from
that
advice
belonged
to
the
government.
the
government
owns
those
records,
both
as
a
matter
of
statute
and
regulation.
and
the
disclosure
of
those
records
is
subject
to
a
highly
reticulated
regime.
there
are
statutes,
there
is
regulations,
there
is
the
freedom
of
information
act.
all
of
that
would
be
bypassed
if
this
court
were
to
accept
the
fiduciary
exception
in
this
context.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
said
to
justice
alito,
it
may
not
always
be
that
the
government
can
point
to
a
specific
competing
interest
in
the
sense
that
justice
sotomayor
is
talking
about,
a
competing
statutory
interest.
but
there
are
inherently
these
tensions,
budgetary
concerns,
other
ways
in
which
the
united
states
interacts
with
indian
affairs.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
could
be
more
nebulous
--
but
--
but
there
--
i
think
there
is
a
real
chilling
concern.
and
i
think
this
dovetails
into
justice
kennedy's
question,
that
the
interior
department,
in
order
to
properly
administer,
to
carry
out
the
statutory
and
regulatory
duties,
it
often
needs
to
seek
the
legal
advice
of
--
of
the
lawyers
in
the
interior
office
or
in
the
department
of
justice.
in
order
to
avoid
the
chilling
the
full
and
frank
seeking
of
rendering
of
legal
advice,
the
same
purposes--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--not
as
a
general
matter,
your
honor.
if
--
if
--
if
we
were
in
the
private
trustee
context
and
a
court
were
to
decide
that
the
fiduciary
exception
applied--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
justifications
are
general
in
nature
and
there
isn't
an
obligation
to--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
think
that's
exactly
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes.
currently
there
are
about
90
such
pending
suits,
counting
all
of
the
district
courts
as
well
as
the
court
of
federal
claims.
and
--
and
--
and
of
course,
this
issue
could
arise
in
any
of
those
cases.
let
me
get
back
to
one
of
justice
sotomayor's
questions,
the
--
the
initial
question
about
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
used
the
term
"trust".
i
think
as
a
matter
of
precedent,
both
the
mitchell
decisions
and
the
navajo
nation
decisions,
i
think
those
are
binding,
controlling
precedent,
and
the
court
should
not
deviate
from
those
precedents
that
say
a
statute
or
regulation
must
define
the
duty.
but
beyond
the
binding
nature
of
those
precedents,
i
think
they
make
sense
from
first
principles
as
well,
and
let
me
try
to
explain
why.
the
--
the
--
the
term
"trust"
has
been
used
by
both
congress
and
the
courts
in
a
variety
of
ways,
often
in
a
variety
of
imprecise
ways,
when
it
comes
to
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
indians
and
indian
tribes.
courts
and
congress
have
used
the
term
when
it
comes
to
providing
law
enforcement,
when
it
comes
to
providing
educational
services,
health
services,
none
of
which
are
really
the
type
of
private
common
law
trust
that
we
know.
and
even
in
scenarios
where
there
is
a
discrete
property
interest
that
might
bring
us
closer
to
the
common
law
context,
this
court
has
used
--
this
court
and
congress
has
recognized
that
"trust"
can
mean
a
lot
of
different
things.
it
can
mean
the
type
of
bare
trust
that
was
at
issue
in
mitchell
1,
the
indian
general
allotment
act,
when
the
trust
was
really
simply
to
avoid
alienation
of
the
land.
it
may
mean
specific
investment
duties,
as
we
have
here.
but
the
point
is
that
there
is
no
"one
size
fits
all"
trust
terminology,
and
so
that's
why
it
makes
sense
for
this
court
to
require
congress
to
set
forth
the
specific
duties
and
statutes,
and
the
interior
department
to
set
forth
specific
duties
and
regulations
before
it
implies
such
a
sweeping
obligation
on
the
united
states.
i
think
it
also
flows
from
a
more
general
principle
of
a
reluctance
to
hold
the
united
states
to
common
law
duties
when
there's
an
existing
statutory
and
regulatory
regime.
i
think
for
all
of
those
reasons,
not
only
as
a
matter
of
precedent,
but
as
--
as
a
matter
of
principle,
i
think
the
--
the
--
the
fiduciary
exception
would
--
would
not
apply
here.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
your
honor,
but
those--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right.
as
i
understand
it,
you're
right,
justice
kennedy,
that
most
of
the
documents
that
the
--
the
trial
court
said
the
government
didn't
have
to
produce
were,
as
you
stated,
attorney
work
product
privileges
--
privileged
documents,
and
those
the
trial
--
the
trial
court
said
that
no
fiduciary
exception
would
apply
to
the
attorney
work
product
privilege.
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
it
allowed
the
government
to
withhold
the
documents.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
if
i
can
just
make
three
--
three
points
on
rebuttal.
the
first
is
with
respect
to
federal
rule
of
evidence
501.
the
government
is
not
implementing
any
trick
here.
this
is
not
a
"heads
you
win,
tails
you
lose.
"
type
situation.
our
argument
is
simple.
we
look
to
--
we
invoke
a
valid
attorney-client
privilege.
the
other
side
invokes
a
common
law
exception
to
that
privilege.
our
argument
is
not
that
no
common
law
exception
is
applicable
to
the
government.
it's
simply
that
the
basis
for
this
common
law
exception
is
not
applicable,
so
the
exception
should
not
be
applicable.
it's
a
very
straightforward
argument.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
in
response
to
the
contention
that
we
have
a
full-fledged
trust
here
as
opposed
to
a
bare
trust
in
mitchell.
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
"a
full-fledged
trust"
means
in
the
indian
trust
context.
certainly
there's
specific
investment-related
duties
that
the
statute
sets
forth
with
respect
to
trust
funds,
but
this
court
has
made
clear
in
--
in
mitchell
and
reiterated
in
the
navajo
nation
decision
that
it's
not
enough
for
the
statute
to
simply
set
forth
the
statutory
duties,
but
it
must
define,
and
this
is
a
quote,
"define
the
contours
of
those
duties.
"
the
statutes
at
issue,
section
161a,
162a,
do
nothing
of
the
sort.
they
don't
even
set
out
a
general
disclosure
obligation,
let
alone
the
contours
of
any
such
disclosure
obligation.
but
even
if
we
were
to
disregard
this
court's
precedents
in
mitchell
and
in
navajo
nation,
and
we
were
to
resort
to
the
common
law
to
flesh
out
the
nature
of
the
responsibilities,
again
there's
nothing
from
the
discrete
investment
obligations
that
are
set
forth
in
those
statutes
that
would
lead
to
a
general
disclosure
obligation,
let
alone
an
intrusive
obligation
to
disclose
the
government's
attorney-client
communications.
and
there's
good
reasons
to
think
that
congress
did
not
apply
such
an
obligation
when
it
has
set
forth
a
fairly
reticulated
statutory
and
regulatory
regime
governing
disclosures,
and
with
respect
to
other
statutes.
for
example,
the
1982
indian
claims
limitation
act
specifically
addressed
privileged
versus
nonprivileged
information.
the
last
point
i
would
make
goes
to
the
general
duty
to
disclose.
whether
that's
contingent
simply
on
payment,
ownership
or
other
factors.
while
it
may
not
be
the
case
that
the
payment
is
the
sole
factor,
it's
certainly
an
important
factor,
and
i
think
as
my
friend
responded
in
response
to
justice
kennedy,
if
in
fact
the
private
trustee
is
paying
for
the
legal
advice
on
their
own,
that's
going
to
be
a
significant
consideration
as
to
whether
the
beneficiary
can
get
it.
and
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
the
lines
are
not
always
going
to
be
clear
between
trust
administration
advice
and
liability
advice.
in
fact,
they're
often
going
to
run
into
one
another.
beyond
payment,
i
think
the
even
more
important
factor
here
is
the
ownership
of
the
records.
while
payment
is
indicative
of
ownership,
when
we're
talking
about
the
government
context,
payment
is
not
the
only
reason
why
we
say
that
the
government
owns
the
records
that
result
from
legal
advice
or
any
other
trust
administration
facet.
that's
set
forth
by
statute
and
regulation,
the
federal
records
act,
and
the
interior
department
regulations
that
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
of
the
brief.
the
reason
why
i
think--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
think
as
a
general
--
i
think
as
a
general
matter,
one
would
think
that
the
client
would
--
it
would
belong
to
the
client,
at
least
in
the
sense
that
the
client
would
have
full
access
to
that
document.
and
i
think
that's
a
fundamental
distinction
here,
that
we're
not
--
because
the
--
these
are
governmental
records,
they're
subject
to
the
statutory
and
regulatory
regime
that
governs
disclosure
of
government
documents,
either
specific
disclosure
obligations
set
forth
by
congress,
interior
department
regulation
or
the
more
general
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
you're
absolutely
correct.
the
fact
that
they're
accessible
by
foia
does
not
--
does
not
change
the
government's
ownership
of
those
records,
but
the
fact
that
congress
is
able
to
set
forth
a
scheme
like
foia
is
turned
on
the
fact
that
these
are
government
records
that
are
owned
by
the
government.
because
they're
government
records,
it's
congress
and
it's
the
interior
department
that
decides
when
to
disclose
them
and
under
what
circumstances
to
disclose
them.
the
tribe's
rule
here
would
eviscerate
that
very
reticulated
statutory
and
regulatory
regime.
thank
you,
your
honor.
