well,
this
is
just
the
general
purpose
behind
the
exception
to
301,
right,
the
--
the
exception
for
providing
attorney's
advice.
the
ordinary
private
litigant
doesn't
have
to
show,
when
he
refuses
to
turn
over
attorney
advice,
that
there's
some
conflict
which
would
make
it
harmful
for
him
to
turn
that
over,
does
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
in
the
trustee
context.
i'm
just
talking
about
the
normal
operation.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
so,
once
you
establish
that
this
isn't
the
normal
trust
complex,
we
apply
the
normal
rule
301
law,
and
--
and
that
does
not
require
the
person
who
declines
to
turn
over
the
information
to
show
why
it
would
really
hurt
him
to
turn
it
over,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
it
ever
been
applied,
to
your
knowledge,
where
--
where
it
was
not
the
case
that
the
trust
paid
for
the
attorney's
advice
out
of
the
trust
funds
and
where
the
trust
did
--
where
--
where
the
trust
owned
the
papers
that
consisted
of
the
attorney's
advice?
is
there
any
case
where
those
two
conditions
or
either
one
of
them
did
not
exist
where
the
--
the
trust
was
required
to
turn
over
the
attorney's
advice?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but,
see,
that's
the
argument
of
the
government,
that
the
exception,
the
trust
exception
to
the
extent
that
it
exists,
was
based
principally
upon
the
fact
that
these
papers
belonged
to
the
trust
and
that
the
attorney's
advice
had
been
paid
for
by
the
trust,
so
of
course
the
trustee
is
entitled
to
get
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
have
a
single
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
why
can't
the
trustee
say:
i'm
going
to
hire
my
own
lawyer?
i'm
not
going
to
pay
this
lawyer
out
of
trust
funds,
so
it
will
be
my
lawyer,
and
his
advice
is
only
to
me
and
serving
my
interests?
why
wouldn't
--
why
wouldn't
that
suffice?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
trustee
cannot
hire
his
own
lawyer,
you're
saying.
so
long
as
he's
a
trustee,
he
cannot
hire
his
own
lawyer
to
get
advice
on
how
to
manage
the
trust
in
a
way
that
will
avoid
his
liability.
he
just
can't
do
it,
right?
trustees
can't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--again,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
that
seems
to
me
an
artificial
distinction.
what
i
ask
from
--
for
from
the
attorney
is
advice
as
to
how
i
can
manage
the
trust
so
as
to
avoid
liability.
i
mean,
the
--
the
two
are
connected.
you
can't
separate
out
advice
as
to
how
to
manage,
how
to
manage
the
trust
from
advice
as
to
how
to
avoid
liability.
in
the
--
in
the
context
of
asking,
of
a
trustee's
asking
advice,
the
two
are
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
do
--
did
it
do
on
that
basis,
retrospective
versus
prospective?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
talking
here
about
competing
interests.
i
mean,
the
example
you
give
of
--
of
the
life
beneficiary
and
the
remainderman,
those
are
interests
of
the
beneficiaries
that
conflict.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
here
about
an
interest
of
the
trustee
that
conflicts
with
what
he
is
supposed
to
do,
with
respect
to
the
person
who
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
trust.
that
--
that's
a
totally
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
ordinarily
if
there
is
that
kind
of
a
conflict
where
the
trustee
has
a
personal
conflict,
he
has
to
step
down
as
trustee.
you
can't
continue
to
be
trustee
when
you
--
your
own
financial
interests,
for
example,
are
against
the
financial
interests
of
the
beneficiary;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
the
government
asserts:
i
have
other
duties
as
government
besides
my
duties
to
the
--
to
these
indians.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
sometimes
those
duties
conflict
with
my
duties
to
the
indians.
