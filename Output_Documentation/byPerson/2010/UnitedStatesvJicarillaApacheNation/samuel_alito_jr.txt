do

do
you
agree
that
the
fiduciary
exception
is
well
established
as
a
general
matter?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
this
cause
arose
in
a
different
context
with
a
different
trustee,
the
position
of
the
united
states
would
be
that
under
rule
501
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
there
is
a
fiduciary
exception
to
the
attorney-client
privilege?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
thrust
of
what
--
my
understanding
of
the
thrust
of
what
justice
sotomayor
was
asking
is
something
like
the
following:
it's
easy
to
understand
how
there
can
be
competing
government
interests
when
you're
talking
about
some,
the
management
of
lands,
things
of
that
nature.
but
when
you're
just
talking
about
managing
funds,
what
competing
interests
can
there
be
in
practical
terms?
if
you
assume
arguendo
that
this
exception
applies
to
a
private
trustee,
why
should
it
not
apply
to
the
government
in
practical
terms?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
the
uniform
trust
code
reserves
decision
on
the
question
whether
there
is
a
fiduciary
exception
to
the
attorney-client
privilege?
that
seems
to
suggest
that
as
a
general
matter,
this
is
not
as
well-established
as
you
seem
to
argue.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
a
private
trustee
may,
using
the
private
trustee's
own
fund,
hire
an
attorney
to
obtain
prospective
advice
about
liability,
does
that
doom
your
argument
here
for
the
reason
that
the
government
claims
it
has
no
ability
to
set
up
a
system
like
this,
to
have
some
attorneys
in
the
solicitor's
office
provide
advice
regarding
the
management
of
the
funds
and
other
attorneys
in
the
solicitor's
office
provide
advice
regarding
--
regarding
the
possibility
of
prospective
liability
in
light
of
all
of
these
suits
that
you
mentioned?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
the
jicarilla
apache
nation
filed
a
breach
of
trust
action
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
seeking
monetary
damages
for
the
government's
alleged
mismanagement
of
the
tribe's
trust
funds.
during
discovery,
the
tribe
moved
to
compel
production
of
certain
documents
and
the
government
asserted
the
attorney-client
privilege.
court
of
federal
claims
granted
the
motion
impart
holding
that
communications
relating
to
the
management
of
trust
funds
fall
within
a
fiduciary
exception
to
the
attorney-client
privilege.
under
that
exception,
which
courts
have
applied
to
common-law
trusts,
a
trustee
who
obtains
legal
advice
related
to
trust
administration
is
precluded
from
asserting
the
attorney-client
privilege
against
trust
beneficiaries.
the
government
petitioned
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
which
the
court
denied.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
trust
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
indian
tribes
is
sufficiently
similar
to
a
private
trust
to
justify
applying
the
fiduciary
exception.
we
disagree.
the
analogy
between
the
government
and
a
private
trustee
cannot
be
taken
too
far.
the
government's
trust
obligations
to
the
tribes
are
governed
by
a
statute,
not
the
common
law.
in
fulfilling
in
statutory
duties,
the
government
acts
not
as
a
private
trustee
but
pursuant
to
its
sovereign
interest
in
the
execution
of
federal
law.
the
two
criteria,
justifying
the
fiduciary
exception,
are
therefore
absent
in
the
context
of
this
trust.
because
its
sovereign
interest
is
distinct
from
the
beneficiaries'
private
interest,
the
government
seeks
legal
advice
in
its
own
rather
than
a
fiduciary
capacity.
in
this
case,
the
relevant
statute
delineates
specific
disclosure
obligations
of
the
government
to
the
tribe.
common
law
does
not
override
the
specific
trust-creating
statute
and
regulations
that
apply
here.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
breyer
has
joined.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
