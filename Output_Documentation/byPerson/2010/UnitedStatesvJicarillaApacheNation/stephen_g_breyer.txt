stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
we
have
the
union
trust
company,
a
private
company
that
has
5,000
trust
accounts.
one
day
the
president
of
the
company
says
to
the
lawyer:
mr.
smith's
account
is
in
a
special
situation.
will
you
please
look
into
what
we
should
do
for
him
as
trustee?
there's
no
implication
for
any
other
account.
there's
no
threat
of
litigation.
i
just
want
to
know
what
we're
supposed
to
do.
now,
i
take
it
the
document
that
is
subsequently
written
would
be
open
for
mr.
smith
to
get;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay.
now,
why
should
the
government
be
treated
differently
were
the
situation
identical
to
what
i
just
proposed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
like
to
get
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question,
to
go
back
to
it,
was
imagine
that
the
government
has
a
thousand
trust
accounts
for
a
thousand
tribes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
imagine
that
several
of
them
consist
of
nothing
more
than
$500,000
in
cash.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
one
day
the
secretary
of
the
interior
says
to
a
lawyer:
i
fear
there
is
kind
of
a
difficult
fiduciary
problem
arising
into
account
number
302,
which
is
owned
by
such
and
such
tribe.
there
is
no
threat
of
litigation.
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
the
answer
to
this
will
have
no
implication
for
anything
else
in
the
government.
will
you
please
look
at
it
and
give
me
a
memo
what
to
do?
now,
why
should
that
memo
not
be
given
to
the
lawyer
for
the
tribe
if
in
the
identical
case
of
the
union
trust
company
you
would
give
the
lawyer
--
the
memo
to
the
beneficiary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying,
one,
we're
not
really
a
trustee
totally?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
if
we
treated
--
the
courts
treated
you
as
a
trustee
really
and
totally--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
this
very
limited
situation
i
described,
what
harm
would
befall
the
government?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
a
question
on
that
particular
point,
and
there
may
be
an
obvious
answer
to
this
which
i
just
couldn't
find.
but
if
the
lawyer
is
in
the
government
and
he
writes
a
memo,
then
--
and
if
it's
available
to
a
litigant
who
litigates
against
the
government,
as
it
would
be
here,
then
why
isn't
it
available
to
the
entire
world
via
the
freedom
of
information
act?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
certainly
true,
they're
not.
but
i
just
wonder,
what
is
it
in
foia
that
would
make
this
not
available
to
the
world?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
just
--
that
just
says
it
may
or
may
not
be
coextensive.
reading
the
statute,
it
says
you
have
to
make
all
interagency
or
all
memos
available
of
a
certain
type,
which
i
think
this
would
fall
into.
then
exception
5
protects,
among
other
things,
attorney-client
memos
that
are
privileged
because
they're
inter-agency
or
intra-agency
memos
that
would
not
be
available
by
law
to
a
party
other
than
an
agency
in
litigation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
they
are
available
if
you
win.
and
so,
if
you
win
that
exception
doesn't
seem
to
apply.
and
if
it
doesn't
seem
to
apply,
that's
what
was
--
then
the
whole
world
can
get
this
memo.
and
what
i'm
wondering
is
there
must
--
either
there
is
a
very
obvious
answer
to
that,
which
there
could
be,
or
there
isn't.
if
there
is
an
obvious
answer,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
there
isn't
an
obvious
answer,
i'll
have
to
go
away
and
worry
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
don't
want
that,
and
what
i'm
looking
is
how
you
prevent
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that
happen
a
lot?
i
mean,
i
--
i
--
i'm
not
--
does
that
happen
a
lot?
i
mean,
are
there
a
lot
of
instances
where
the
lawyers
who
work
for
all
--
the
retirement
funds
are
huge.
there
must
be
cases
coming
up
all
the
time.
and
all
the
advice
of
the
lawyers
is
just
available--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know
that.
i'm
just
worried
about
the
--
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
somewhat
sacred,
and
suddenly
making
everything
available
to
the
whole
public
has
got
me
worried.
and
i
looked
at
that
sears
case.
i
didn't
see
anything
there
that
eases
my
concern.
and
then
you
referred
to
a
different
case,
the
name
of
which
i
forgot,
and
i
could
not
find.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
in
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
am
i
going
to
find
it?
i
couldn't
get
how
you
spell
it.
