justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
instance
you've
been
able
to
think
of
where
an
indian
tribe
could
have
a
claim
for
money
of
some
kind
and
some
other
kind
of
relief
that
they
seek
where
they
couldn't
get
it
all
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
declaratory
judgment.
is
there
anything
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
injunctive
relief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
matter
what.
okay.
well,
then
they
have
a
problem,
because
they
might
want
--
they
might
want
some
money
and
they
want
an
injunction.
so
what
are
they
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
big
choice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
basic
point
is
this:
you're
just
saying
it's
too
bad,
go
to
congress.
but
you
don't
deny
the
basic
point,
which
is
that
an
indian
tribe
may
think
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
has
really
mismanaged
everything
and
what
they
would
like
is
some
money,
and
also
they
want
an
injunction
so
they
won't
do
it
again.
and
now
your
view
is,
it's
true,
there
is
no
way
they
can
get
that,
because
they
have
to
go
to
two
different
courts,
and
really
in
your
view
they
can't
go
to
two
different
courts,
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
hardship
is
definite.
it's
just
you
are
saying,
that's
what
congress
wanted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
it
just
as
bad
as
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
main
thrust
that
i
was
raising
was
does
this
really
get
the
tribe
into
trouble?
they
have
to
forego
one
kind
of
relief
for
another.
so
what
about
injunctive
relief,
that's
what
he
thought
of,
and
justice
scalia
raises
the
point,
well,
they
are
not
going
to
be
entitled
to
injunctive
relief
anyway
because
the
apa
doesn't
provide
it,
if
i
understand
that
correctly.
so
you
are
giving
up
the
null
set.
you
were
giving
up
the
null
set.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
couldn't
get
it
in
the
court
--
in
the
claims?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
couldn't
get
that
kind
of
relief
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it
could.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
trying
to
work
out
still
in
my
mind,
is
if
you
say,
look,
indian
tribe:
you
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
period.
period.
you
can't
go
to
these
other
courts,
i
mean
unless
you
give
up
the
court
of
claims.
is
the
indian
tribe
going
to
really
lose
something
it
needs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
think
yes.
i
realize
that.
[laughter]
and,
what
i
want
to
ask
you
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
in
section
2--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
1491
there
is
a
sentence
which
says,
about
the
court
of
claims,
in
any
case
including
the
1505
tucker
act,
the
court
shall
have
the
power
to
remand
appropriate
matters
to
any
administrative
or
executive
body
or
official
with
such
direction
as
it
is
may
deem
proper
and
just.
now
that
seems
awfully
broad,
so
i'm
thinking
now,
if
they
want
money,
they
can
get
the
money
from
the
court
of
claims.
if
they
want
something
like
an
injunction,
they
could
ask
the
court
of
claims,
tell
the
executive
branch
to
behave
the
way
we
think
they
have
to
under
the
law
and
there's
your
authority.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
quoting.
now
what's
--
i
want
to
know
the
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
want
money;
that
causes
the
problem.
if
you
don't
want
any
money,
you
don't
have
a
problem.
you
just
forget
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
had
under
the
impression
that
sometimes
they
sued
for
some
money
out
of
a
fund,
which
would
have
been
partial,
and
other
times
they
sued
for
the
value
of
the
cotton,
and
other
times
they
sued
for
the
cotton
itself,
which
in
certain
circumstances
could
have
been
worth
a
lot
more.
by
the
time
of
suit,
it
went
up.
i
mean,
do
we
know
it
was
always
duplicative
in
those
cotton
suits?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
the
amount
differs,
then,
why
do
you
suppose
the
cotton
belonged
to
the
indian
tribe?
on
the
one
hand,
they
want
an
accounting
out
of
the
money
ever
earned
out
of
this
cotton
in
the
past
and
on
the
other
hand,
they
want
what
the
cotton
is
worth
in
the
future
on
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
justice
scalia's
question.
