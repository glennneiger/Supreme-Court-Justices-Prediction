justice

but
you
recognize
that
sequential
suits
could
be
brought.
so
that
if
the
case
in
the
district
court
went
to
final
judgment,
then
it
would
be
okay
to
go
to
the
court
of
federal
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
have
control
over
how
long
the
district
court
case
is
going
to
take,
and
there
is
no
mechanism
to
stop
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
couldn't
get
both.
i
mean,
that's
i
think
justice
sotomayor's
point,
about
duplication.
it's
not
--
even
if
you
can
say,
yes,
it's
a
different
mode
of
relief,
but
you
could
--
couldn't
get
--
i
mean,
suppose
we
didn't
have
1500
and
you
prevailed
in
your
suit
on
the
apca
or
whatever
you
call
the
statute.
you
could
not
then
turn
around
and
sue
the
government
official,
because
you
have
the
--
the
single
claim,
you've
been
compensated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
here
--
it's
quite
different.
i
mean,
one
suit
is
not
precluded
by
the
other.
you
--
you
recognize
that
by
saying
you
could
bring
the
claims
court
suit
after
the
district
court
suit.
that's
not
so
in
--
in
the
cotton
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
my
question.
assuming
you
had
a
recovery
under
the
--
for
the
--
confiscated
cotton,
under
the
one
route
you
had
a
recovery.
you
could
not
sue
again
under
the
other
route
without
--
leaving
aside
1500,
because
the
claim
would
be
precluded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
so,
not
so
here,
because
of
the
way
congress
has
set
up
the
authority
of
each
court.
you
could
never
--
what
is
it,
54(c)
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--54(c)
is
the
relief
to
which
you
were
entitled.
the
only
relief
to
which
you
were
entitled
in
the
one
court,
the
court
of
claims,
is
compensatory
damages.
so
there
isn't
a
question
of
some
other
form
of
relief.
you
have
to
go
to
another
forum
to
get
different
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
test
that
choice
--
it's
pretty
stark
in
the
casman
case,
where
congress
said
back
pay
is
for
the
claims
court,
reinstatement
for
the
district
court.
but
your
position
is
that
under
your
reading
of
casman
--
let's
forget
about
congress's
amendment.
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
the
casman
decision
was
wrong
and
the
plaintiff
had
to
choose
either
back
pay
or
reinstatement;
there
was
no
way
to
get
both.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government
says
the
statute
is
simple.
it
says
you
can't
have
two
suits
simultaneously,
or
you
can't
when
the
cfc
suit
is
the
--
the
second
one.
and
mr.
yang
told
me
that
yes,
the
government
thinks
that
in
the
casman
case
there
was
a
choice,
you
can
sue
for
reinstatement
in
the
district
court,
you
can
sue
for
back
pay
in
the
claims
court,
but
you
cannot
get
both.
and
when
congress
realized
that
that's
what
was
happening,
congress
did
not
adopt
a
two
--
didn't
bless
the
two-state
--
two
court
solution.
congress
said,
there
will
be
one
lawsuit.
it
will
all
be
in
the
claims
court,
and
they
can
grant
both
the
back
pay
and
the
reinstatement.
so
the
two-suit
approach
was
rejected,
i
guess,
in
--
in
congress's
response
to
casman.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
definition
of
"claim"
in
the
federal
rules,
i
think.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
loveladies
situation?
