justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
the
cotton
cases,
why
isn't
my
reading
of
it
quite
very
simple,
which
is
congress
was
concerned
with
ensuring
that
a
claimant
didn't
get
double-recovered
in
two
different
suits.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
that
a
simple
--
you
know,
you've
got
people
suing
in
different
jurisdictions
over
getting
the
same
pot
of
money
or
something
close
to
it.
why
isn't
our
view
of
1500
just
simply
you
can't
have
two
suits
that
are
seeking
the
same
pot?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
our
rule
simply
--
what
is
so
wrong
with
a
rule
that
says
if
you
can
bring
it
in
the
court
of
claims
you
have
to,
but
if
there's
relief
that
you
can't
secure
there
you
can
have
two
lawsuits?
what
is
so
irrational
about
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
there
is
no
double
recovery
possible.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
have
already
gone
through
that
because
most
of
those
claims
would
have
had
some
element
of
double
recovery,
that
might
have
precluded
a
second
action.
the
point
that
i
raised
was
if
there
is
a
chance
of
potential
double
recovery,
you
can't
breach,
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
you
could
not
bring
in
the
court
of
claims
the
old
money
claims,
and
why?
that
the
government
mismanaged--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it
does,
because
why
couldn't
you
simply
have
said,
they
owe
us
that
original
extra
10
bucks
--
$10,
and
we
want
it?
what
--
what--
