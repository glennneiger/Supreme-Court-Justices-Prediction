mr.
anthony
yang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
in
keene
held
that
section
1500
of
title
28
deprives
the
court
of
federal
claims
has
jurisdiction
when
the
plaintiff
has
a
pending
suit
in
another
court
based
on
substantially
the
same
operative
facts
and
left
open
the
question
whether
some
overlap
in
the
relief
requested
is
also
necessary
to
trigger
that
bar.
the
federal
circuit
erred
in
holding
that
section
1500
applies
when
both
suits
--
only
when
both
suits
seek
the
same
relief,
and
that
the
critical
distinction
in
this
regard
is
whether
the
particular
relief
in
the
plaintiff's
plea
for
relief
is
deemed
legal
or
equitable.
section
1500's
text
broadly
bars
cfc
jurisdiction
whenever
any
suit
that
the
plaintiff
has
pending
in
any
other
court
is
a
suit
for
the
cfc
claim
or
is
merely
a
suit
in
respect
to
that
claim.
in
other
words,
another
suit
for
a
different
but
a
related
claim
will
trigger
section
1500.
that
provision
was
intended
to
protect
the
government
from
simultaneous
duplicative
suits
against
the
united
states
and
its
agents
by
forcing
plaintiffs
to
elect
between
those
related
suits.
mr.
anthony
yang
that
is
correct.
in
some,
in
perhaps
a
good
number
of
cases,
it's
possible
to,
if
you
are
seasonably
prompt
in
your
court
of
federal
claims
case
or
your
district
court
case
first--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
i
think
there
is
some
control
that
you
can
exercise
over
the
--
how
promptly
the
suit
proceeds.
particularly
if
we
are
talking
about
suits
against
the
government,
many
suits
proceed
on
an
administrative
record
and
go
directly
to
summary
judgment;
that
can
be
done
in
a
relatively
prompt
manner.
but
even
if
not,
the
congress
that
enacted
section
1500
in
1868
knew
that
essentially
what
it
was
doing
in
many,
many
cases
would
prevent
a
second
suit
from
going
forward.
that's
because
the
congress
was
concerned
with
the
cotton
claimants.
the
cotton
claimants
had
authorization
to
bring
suit
in
the
court
of
claims,
but
there
was
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations.
that
statute
ran
from
the
end
of
the
civil
war.
and
this
court
in
a
case
called
u.s.
v.
anderson
at
76
u.s.,
and
the
relevant
pages
are
70
to
71,
made
clear
that
the
end
of
the
civil
war
for
the
purposes
of
that
statute
was
august
in
1866.
congress
enacted
section
1500
in
june
of
1868.
there
was
a
two-month
window,
if
that,
to
bring
suit
and
congress
recognized,
it
would
have
recognized,
that
if
you
filed
suit
or
were
forced
to
elect
at
that
point,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
game.
there
was
also
another
statutory
provision
that
congress
enacted
during
the
civil
war
that
put
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations
on
suits
against
officers.
that
was
discussed
in
this
court's
decision,
mitchell
v.
clark,
110
u.s.
633
at
pages
641
and
642.
so
given
the
time
at
which
congress
was
enacting
section
1500,
it
knew
it
was
putting
plaintiffs
to
a
very
hard
choice.
you
had
to
elect
between
the
court
of
federal
claims
remedy
and
between
a
remedy
in
another
court
against
an
officer.
that
remedy
would
likely
be
the
end
of
the
game.
and
congress
did
that
in
a
very
particular
way.
it
did
it
in
a
targeted
statute
that
limited
the
authority
of
the
court
that
had
its
hands
on
the
purse
strings
of
the
federal
government,
and
that
performed
the
very
function
that
congress
just
a
few
years
earlier
had
itself
exercised
through
the
enactment
of
private
bills
through
its
appropriations
power.
so
section
1500
ultimately
states
in
essence
that
if
you
are
going
to
bring
suit
in
this
specialized
court
where
congress
has
vested
the
court
of
claims
with
the
very
special
power
of
distributing
money
from
the
federal
fisc,
that
you
could
only
bring
one
suit
arising
from
the
same
operative
facts
in
order
to
be
in
that
court.
mr.
anthony
yang
well--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
it
wasn't
the
same
pot
of
money.
the
abandoned
and
--
abandoned
property
collection
act
--
we
will
call
it
apca
--
provided
for
a
special
statutory
trust
remedy.
that
remedy
was
for
the
net
proceeds
of
anything
--
any
--
any
auction
sales
that
might
have
resulted
from
cotton.
if
the
cotton
was
lost,
it
was
damaged,
it
was
destroyed,
if
the
proceeds
were
paid
but
ultimately
didn't
make
their
way
into
the
fisc,
you
got
nothing
or
you
got
a
substantially
reduced
fund.
if
you
sued
in
court,
you
might
be
able
to
sue,
as
we
explained
in
our
reply
brief,
under
certain
doctrines
that
would
give
you
the
property
in
specie,
or
you
could
seek
monetary
relief.
these
are
quite
different
things.
and
even
in
--
it's
not--
mr.
anthony
yang
--i
don't
know--
mr.
anthony
yang
--you
may
in
certain
instances.
but
particularly
in
the
cotton
cases,
congress
knew
that
it
--
what
it
was
doing
was
forcing
one
path
and
only
one
path.
it
wasn't
about
duplicative
recovery.
you
had
to
choose
and
you
not
--
you
weren't
going
to
have
time
to
bring
another
suit,
and
congress
would
have
known
that
when
it
enacted
the
section
1500's
predecessor
two
months
before
the
statute
ran
in
apca
and
perhaps
after
the
statute
ran
for
bringing
a
tort
suit
against
officials
under
the
cases
--
the
statute
that
this
court
construed
in
mitchell.
so
it
wasn't
simply
that
duplicative
relief
was
at
issue,
congress
was
actually
forcing
you
to
make
a
choice
in
cases
where
the
types
of
relief
are
quite
different.
and
the
type
of
relief,
for
instance,
that
you
would
get
in
a
suit
against
an
agent
of
the
united
states,
what
you
get
out
of
that
suit
is
not
a
pot
of
money;
the
court
does
not
say
at
the
end
of
the
case,
here
you
go,
you
asked
for
$1,000,
here
it
is.
the
court
enters
an
order;
it
enters
a
judgment.
it
says,
"defendant,
perhaps
tony
yang,
officer
of
the
government,
you
pay
$100
million,
$50
million.
"
it
doesn't
mean
much
to
the
plaintiff
if
they
get
at
tony
yang
as
an
individual.
this
is
very
different
relief
than
a
money
judgment
against
the
united
states.
it's
not
the
same
relief.
and
in
fact,
we
don't
normally
think
of
a
claim
as
embodying
a
particular
type
of
relief,
which
is
the
submission
of
the
trial
here.
mr.
anthony
yang
that
might
have
been
true
in
one
direction
but
maybe
not
in
the
other.
and
let
me
explain.
the
--
i'm
not
sure
that
there
was
an
instance
of
this
happening
because
of
section
1500's
existence,
but
if
you
had,
for
instance,
obtained
damages
against
an
individual
agent
in
a
suit
and
you
still
could
have
brought
suit
within
the
abandoned
--
abandoned
property
collection
act,
the
abandoned
collection
property
act
provided
a
statutory
trust
for
the
owner
of
the
cotton.
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
that
would
have
been
precluded.
there
may
well
have
been,
but
for
the
statute
of
limitations
problem,
the
ability
to
get
a
double
recovery.
but
nevertheless,
i
mean,
our
submission
ultimately
turns
on
our
understanding
of
the
text
of
this
statute,
which
is
quite
broad.
the
text
not
only
precludes--
mr.
anthony
yang
--i
--
that's
--
that's
true
in
some
cases
of
an
accounting.
it's
not
true
on
these
complaints.
the
complaints
here
are
--
they
have
the
sense
of
a
kitchen
sink
type
of
a
pursuit
of
these
claims
against
the
united
states.
the
district
court
case
is
not
simply
seeking
an
accounting
of
old
money,
as
the
tribe
submits.
it
actually
alleges
a
whole
slew
of
breaches,
including
the
breach
to
--
to
--
of
failure
to
invest
money
properly,
failing
to
put
it
to
its
highest
use,
says
the
true
balances
would
be
far
greater
but
for
these
breaches.
it
specifically
seeks
a--
mr.
anthony
yang
--no,
because
back
--
the
counts
--
these
are
back
on
pages
90
and
91a
of
the
petition
appendix.
the
tribe
not
only
seeks
an
accounting,
but
it
also
seeks
an
order
to
comply
with
all
other
fiduciary
duties
determined
by
the
court.
this
is
paragraph
42.
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
tribe
is
not
only
entitled
to
object
and
essentially
challenge
the
accounting,
but
it's
entitled
to
any
other
equitable
relief
that
might
be
appropriate
in
light
of
the
--
the
court's
decision
in
the
case.
so
the
tribe
is
in
no
way
trying
in
the
district
court
simply
to
seek
an
accounting.
just
like
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
it's
not
simply
looking
to
what
they
claim
to
be
new
money.
the
specific
allegations
in
the
cfc
complaint
say
that
there
has
been
no
money
for
the
--
no
accounting
for
the
revenue
collected.
mr.
anthony
yang
the
tribe--
mr.
anthony
yang
--it
--
it
should
be
that
way
if
there
were
a
narrowly
tailored
apa-type-like
suit
in
district
court,
but
that's
not
this.
the
tribe's
complaints
both
invoke,
for
instance,
the
cobell
litigation
which
has
been
going
on
in
--
in
d.c.
for
quite
some
time,
and
are
modeled
on
the
same
types
of
broad
claims
that
are
at
issue
at
cobell.
this
is
not
a
simple
case
where
there
is
agency
action
withheld
and
a
court
says:
agency,
you
had
x
duty;
do
it.
this
is
a
--
a
situation
where
the
tribe
is
seeking
to
impose
itself
on
age-old
decisions
that
have
been
made
a
long
time
ago
and
to
seek
to
revisit
them
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
restate
their
accounts
to
reflect
what
they
think
should
be
in
the
trust
fund.
this
parallels
in
both
the
federal
circuit
--
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
the
district
court
suit.
there
is
substantial
overlap
in
the
operative
facts.
as
the
two
judges
--
the
only
two
judges
to
have
addressed
this--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
there's
a
difference--
mr.
anthony
yang
--the
--
there
is
a
difference
between
the
parties,
and
i
don't
think
it's
been
fully
fleshed
out
here,
about
what
an
accounting
is.
the
statute
at
issue
that
the
tribe
invokes
for
the
accounting
in
our
view
provides
a
prospective
obligation
for
the
government
to
provide
quarterly
statements
of
what's
coming
in
and
out
of
the
account
going
forward.
mr.
anthony
yang
going
forward,
not
going
back,
and
only
with
respect
to
moneys
that
were
deposited
or
invested
under
a
specific
statutory
authority
that
involves
deposits
that
were
made
in
banks.
so
in
our
view
--
you
know,
our
view
and
the
tribe's
view
i
think
are
quite
different
in
terms
of
what's
at
issue
in
the
district
court
case.
and
unfortunately,
that's
not
the
case
that's
before
you
here.
but
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
say
whether
or
not
there
is
substantial
overlap
between
the
two.
and--
mr.
anthony
yang
--no,
i
don't
think
we
are
at
cross-purposes.
what
we
are
saying
is
what
the
complaint
alleges.
we
don't
control
how
the
tribe
seeks
to
assert
rights.
we
think
that
the
complaint
may
be
overbroad,
but
that's
not
the
correct
question.
i
mean,
this
court
in
keene,
for
instance,
addressed
suits
which
had
been
dismissed
because
they
were
improperly
brought
in
district
court,
and
those
suits
in
district
court
were
sufficient
to
trigger
section
1500's
jurisdictional
bar
simply
because
they
were
asserting
claims
that
overlapped
with
the
claims
that
were
at
issue
in
the
cfc.
mr.
anthony
yang
i
think
so.
i
mean--
mr.
anthony
yang
--right,
which
draws
a
distinction
between
the
claim
and
the
relief,
right?
if
relief
were
the
particular
type
of
relief,
as
the
tribe
asserts,
the
rule
would
simply
say
"failure
to
state
a
claim",
because
you
would
have
failed
to
state
a
certain
element,
a
necessary
element,
of
the
claim.
instead,
it
says
"failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
"
and
i
think
that
--
that
keys
into
the
other
important
provision
of
rule
--
the
civil
rules
for
this
purpose,
which
is
rule
54(c),
which
makes
clear
that
the
relief
that
might
be
initially
stated
in
a
complaint
is
not
the
relief
that
is
at
issue
in
the
case.
the
relief
that
comes
at
issue
in
the
case
is
the
relief
that
the
--
that
is
proven,
whether
it
be
at
summary
judgment
or
at
trial.
and
even
if,
for
instance,
you
ask
for
a
dollar
in
damages
in
your
complaint,
it
may
well
be
that
at
trial
you
establish
your
entitlement
to
injunctive
relief
or
damages
far
in
excess.
mr.
anthony
yang
(c).
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
yes
and
no.
the
district
court
complaint,
for
instance
--
and
again,
we
contest
this,
but
they
seek
a
restatement
of
their
accounts.
they
seek
remedies
such
as
equitable
disgorgement
and
the
like.
these
are
monetary
remedies
that
go,
again,
to
the
same
types
of
issues.
mr.
anthony
yang
all
of
these
claims
could
be
brought--
mr.
anthony
yang
--in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
anthony
yang
that's
correct,
but
if
you
have
a
claim,
for
instance
--
taking
the
old
money/new
money
framework,
which
we
don't
think
is
borne
out
by
the
complaints,
but
even
if
we
were
correct,
if
they
were
seeking
so-called
old
money
in
district
court
--
that
is,
money
that
should
have
been
there,
but
was
improperly
allocated
and
therefore
didn't
show
up
in
their
account
--
they
could
also
bring
a
claim
under
the
indian
tucker
act
claiming
that
there
was
some
breach
of
duty
under
a
statute
or
regulation,
clear
and
--
this
is
a
navajo
nation-type
question
--
and
you
could
get
an
accounting
through
--
in
order
to
determine
the
proper
amount
that
should
be
there.
so
this
is
a
way
--
the
problem
that
we
have
here,
particularly
in
these
cases
where
there's
an
allegation
of
100
years
of
trust
duties
going
back,
and
simultaneously
litigating
these
cases
in
courts
that
might
have
different
views
on
discovery
obligations,
different
views
of
the
law
on
various
point
cases.
one
of
the
cases
that
we
cite
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
ak-chin
case,
the
cfc
ordered
discovery,
for
instance,
that
we
have
to
conduct
a
review
of
33,000
boxes
of
materials
from
the
archives.
although
we
claim
there
is
an
apa
case
going
on
in
district
court,
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
discovery
there.
we
are
fighting
it.
but
this
type
of
duplicative
legislation
and
burden
on
the
government
is
precisely
what
congress
in
1868
said:
if
you
are
going
to
bring
suit--
mr.
anthony
yang
--a
declaratory
judgment,
for
instance.
some
--
many
--
some
of
these
cases
arise--
mr.
anthony
yang
--um
--
well,
i
mean,
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
injunctive
relief.
mr.
anthony
yang
not
normally
in
the
court
of
claims.
there
are
exceptions.
mr.
anthony
yang
there
is
no
question
that
section
1500
may
put
a
plaintiff
at
a
difficult
choice.
mr.
anthony
yang
it's
a
choice
that
has
existed
since
1868,
when
congress--
mr.
anthony
yang
--that's
correct.
and
i
think
that
was
this
court's
suggestion
at
the
end
of
keene,
when
the
court
recognized
that
because
there
are
complicated
jurisdictional
regimes
that
apply
when
you
sue
the
government,
the
court
explained
there
may
well
be
situations
where
this
precludes
a
plaintiff
from
seeking
all
the
relief
that
you
would
otherwise
be
able
to
get
if
you
could
bring
suit
separately.
and
the
court
in
keene
said:
look,
if
there
is
apparent
hardship
--
this
is
following
its
decision
in
corona
coal,
which
is
1924.
if
there
is
a
hardship
in
the
statute,
it
is
a
question
that
must
be
directed
to
congress,
because
congress
is
the
one
that
set
this
up,
this
jurisdictional
limit.
and
the
jurisdictional
limit
that
existed
in
1868,
remember,
was
a
very
difficult
choice.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
let
me
qualify--
mr.
anthony
yang
--the
hardship
may
be
there.
the
hardship
is
less
now
than
it
was
in
1868
because
of
the
language
of
the
statute--
mr.
anthony
yang
--because
you
might
be
able
to
bring,
for
instance,
an
apa
suit
that
completes
before
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
ends.
and
frankly,
we
don't
think
that
that's
an
unusual
thing,
for
an
apa
action
to
be
brought
promptly,
even
with
an
appeal.
apa
actions,
again,
if
it's
limited
to
the
administrative
record
as
they
should,
you
can
go
straight
to
a
summary
judgment-like
procedure--
mr.
anthony
yang
--no,
no.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
was
a
proper
suit.
but
what
you
could
do
is
you
could
pursue
it
and
it
could
complete
and
still
be
--
there
would
still
be
time
to
bring
a
suit
in
the
court
of
federal--
mr.
anthony
yang
--perhaps,
that's
right.
we
think
these
suits--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
but
that's
precisely
what
they
are
seeking
to
do
here,
and
we
just
disagree
whether
that
relief
is
available
in
district
court.
and
the
question
here
is
whether
you
can
simultaneously
pursue
it.
let
me
be
clear.
these
cases
in
our
view
should
almost
all
be
brought
normally
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
these
cases
are
seeking
money
for
past
actions
and
that's
precisely
what
the
court
of
federal
claims
should
address.
however,
a
number
of
plaintiffs
like
to
try
their
hand
at
more
than
one
court
and
they
bring
simultaneous
suits,
just
as
tucker
--
the
cotton
claimants
did
in
the
1860's,
where
congress
provided
for
a
general
statute,
very
broadly
worded.
it
applies
to
any
claim
for
and
in
respect
to
which
any
suit
or
process
is
pending
in
any
other
court
against
the
u.s.
or
any
person
acting
or
professing
to
act
as
its
agents.
it's
a
very
broad
statute.
mr.
anthony
yang
in
some
cases,
it's
is
a
tough
choice.
casman
would
have
been
a
very
difficult
choice.
but
as
this
court
suggested
in
keene,
the
question
goes
to
congress,
and
when
congress
addressed
the
question
it
decided
relief
of
that
sort
should
be
brought
all
in
the
court
of
claims.
but
in
this
case,
this
is
not
a
case
where
we
think
particular
hardship
would
be
had,
because
the
tribe
could
pursue
its
claims
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
probably
should
be
doing
that
if
it
simply--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
that
doesn't
square--
mr.
anthony
yang
--but
that
doesn't
square
even
with
the
history
of
what
congress
is
trying
to
target.
the
relief
that
was
available
in
the
court
of
claims
in
the
1860's
in
the
abandoned
property
collection
act
was
a
very
limited--
mr.
anthony
yang
--i
don't
think
it
squares
with
the
text
of
the
statute,
which
is
broader
than,
doesn't
provide
for
a
claim,
it
doesn't
provide
for
relief,
it
doesn't
speak
to
double
recovery.
if
congress
was
intending
to
target
that
specific
problem
it
could
have
done
so
in
a
much
more
direct
manner.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
anthony
yang
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
tribe
is
unable
to
identify
a
textual
basis
for
its
same
relief
defense
to
the
court
of
federal
claims.
if
it's
definition
of
claim
is
as
narrow
and
circumscribed
as
it
defines,
it
wouldn't
capture
the
cotton
claim.
moreover,
putting
aside
the
definition
of
claim,
the
statute
applies
when
there
is
a
pending
suit
or
process
in
another
court.
that
is
not
only
for
the
claim,
but
in
respect
to
the
claim.
that
substantially
broadens
the
statute.
two,
there
are
two
problems
with
the
same
relief
test
that's
as
a
practical
matter.
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
same
relief
is
being
sought
in
the
other
court,
which
is
the
relevant
question
under
their
test,
you
have
to
ask,
what
relief
would
be
sought
in
district
court.
but
rule
54(c)
makes
clear
that
the
relief
which
is
available
in
district
court
is
not
specified
by
the
complaint,
it's
whatever
develops
through
the
case.
so
you
might
not
know
until
the
very
end
whether
duplicative
relief
is
being
sought.
secondly,
if
you
are
going
to
limit
the
relief
that
is
available
in
the
district
court
based
on
what
the
court
of
claims'
view
is
of
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
to
issue
relief,
you
are
inviting
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
the
federal
circuit
to
be
opining
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
under
the
apa,
in
very
complicated
cases
which
involve
questions
of
bowen,
utah
wilderness,
this
is
not
the
way
that
you
would
construe
normally
a
jurisdictional
statute.
the
specter
of
50-year
old
suits
proceeding
simultaneously
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
in
district
court
certainly
would
have
motivated,
or
spoken
to
the
congress
that
enacted
section
1500's
predecessor
in
1868.
mr.
anthony
yang
i'm
not
exactly
sure
the
differences
that
they
are
pointing
to.
there
are
differences
in
terms
of
the
procedure
and
what
is
a
relief.
the
other
you
would
have
to
show
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a
breach
and
you
get
a
full
kind
of
accounting
to
quantify
damages
that
relate
--
in
aid
of
judgment.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
example,
losing
$10
and
you
collect
20
but
only
debit
--
put
10
on
the
books,
that
is
a
claim
which
is
cognizable
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
if
they
have
a
money
mandating
statute
of
regulations.
mr.
anthony
yang
that's
what
discovery
--
that's
what
discovery
is
for.
the
ak-chin
case,
for
instance.
33,000
boxes
of
discovery
we
have
to
go
through
in
terms
of
a
discovery
request
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
this
is
done
--
this
is
the
way
cases
normally
proceed.
they
do
not
proceed
on
dual
tracks
where
the
very
premise
of
liability
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
is
being
litigated
in
district
court,
or
they
are
seeking
to
challenge,
you
know,
an
accounting.
accounting
normally
would
be,
you
know,
here's
an
account
of
your
--
your
assets,
but
they're
seeking
to
challenge
it.
if
you
went
back
to
equity,
for
instance.
a
trustee
does,
as
an
equitable
matter,
have
a
duty
to
account
when
requested.
but
the
cost
of
the
accounting
is
taken
out
of
the
trust
corpus.
that's
not
what
is
going
on
here.
they
are
trying
to
seek
to
use
the
apa
to
force
something
which
we
don't
think
is
authorized
under
statute
as
a
secondary
means
of
discovery
for
the
same
claims
that
are
at
issue
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
that
type
of
duplicative
litigation
and
the
burden
on
the
federal
courts
is
precisely
what
section
1500
was
intended
to
prevent
against,
and
in
the
absence
of
a
textual
basis
for
the
same
relief
test
that
the
court
of
federal
claims
or
federal
circuit
adopted
here
i
think
is
fatal
to
the
case.
mr.
anthony
yang
i
can't
speak
to
that,
justice
kennedy,
that
is
possible.
i'm
just
not
that
versed
in
equity
jurisprudence
to
be
able
to
give
you
a
definitive
answer.
mr.
anthony
yang
in
loveladies,
if
i
may
answer.
mr.
anthony
yang
loveladies
involved
a
district
court
claim
for
a
declaration
that
the
action
wasn't
taken.
the
district
court
taking
declaration
which
was
ultimately
disposed
of,
but
at
the
same
time
that
loveladies
was
seeking
does
assert
a
claim
for
just
compensation
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
