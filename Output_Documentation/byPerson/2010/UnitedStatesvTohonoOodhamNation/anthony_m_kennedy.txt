do
you
read
the
claim
in
section
1500
the
same
way
that
it
should
be
--
or
do
you
think
we
should
read
it
the
same
way
in
1500
and
12(b)(6),
failure--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--whether
or
not
you've
stated
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
it
well
established
that
part
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
equity
court
when
it
requires
an
accounting
is
to
give
damages
for
breach
of
the
trustee's
duty?
that's
hornbook.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i'm
talking
about
historically
in
equity.
no.
historically
in
equity
the
trustee
who
breaches
the
trustee's
duty
in
the
equity
court
is
required
to
give
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
common
law,
it's
not
common
law,
it's
equity.
it's
old
law,
it's
equity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
you
are
in
the
cfc,
don't
you
get
--
you
aren't
you
asking
for
compensation
for
losses
and
injuries
from
the
commingling
or
the
misappropriation
of
assets?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
brief
makes
the
--
seems
to
make
the
point
that
that's
all
just
interest
on
capital.
it's
not
for
lost
capital.
but
even
as
you
described
it,
it
sounds
to
me
that
you
get
damages
for
loss
of
capital
plus
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
problem
is
that
i
read
the
cfc
complaint
as
including
both.
i
will
take
a
look
at
it.
and
i
intruded
on
justice
breyer's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
your
case
--
now,
let's
assume
the
government
prevails.
you
go
to
the
cfc,
and
you
prevail
on
everything.
you
get
all
the
findings
in
your
favor
and
so
forth.
there
is
some
relief
that
you
don't
get.
i
take
it,
unless
i
am
missing
something,
that
you
could
then,
after
the
cfc
suit
is
finished,
go
to
district
court
and
say:
now
we
want
this
added
protection,
this
added
relief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
statute
wouldn't
have
run
generally,
because
if
you
are
seeking
the
injunction,
it's
only
latches
bars
you,
and
you
are
not
barred
by
latches
because
you
couldn't
have
gone
sooner.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
accounting
doesn't
come
out
of
the
trust
corpus
if
there
is
misfeasance,
the
trustee
has
to
pay
the
damages
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
tohono
o'odham
nation
is
an
indian
tribe
with
federal
recognition.
the
nation's
main
reservation
is
in
the
sonoran
desert,
which
is
in
southern
arizona.
and
counting
this
and
other
reservation
lands,
the
nation's
land
holdings
are
approximately
3
million
acres.
the
case
turned
on
a
relationship
between
two
suits
that
the
indian
nation
filed.
first,
the
nation
sued
federal
officers
in
united
states
district
court
for
alleged
violations
of
fiduciary
duty
with
respect
to
tribal
assets
that
the
government
holds
in
trust.
second
and
on
the
next
day,
the
nation
sued
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
for
the
same
violations.
now,
a
federal
statute,
which
was
enacted
in
1868,
is
designed
to
limit
duplicate
suits
against
the
government.
the
statute
bars
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
over
any
claim
"for
or
in
respect
to"
which
the
plaintiff
has
another
suit
pending
in
another
court.
and
so
here,
the
question
to
be
resolved
is
what
it
means
for
two
suits
to
be
"for
or
in
respect
to"
the
same
claim.
in
a
case
called
keene
versus
united
states,
this
court
held
that
two
suits
are
“for
in
respect
to”
the
same
claim
when
they
are
"based
on
substantially
the
same
operative
facts
--
at
least
if
there
is
some
overlap
in
the
relief
requested."
keene
therefore
narrows
the
permissible
constructions
of
the
statute
to
one
of
two
interpretations,
either
the
statute
requires
substantial
factual
and
some
remedial
overlap,
or
it
requires
substantial
factual
overlap
without
more.
the
court
opinion
today
concludes
that
factual
overlap
is
sufficient
to
trigger
the
statute's
jurisdictional
bar.
the
text
of
the
statute
precludes
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
not
only
the
plaintiff
sues
on
an
identical
claim
elsewhere,
that
is
a
suit
for
the
same
claim
--
but
also
if
the
plaintiff's
other
action
is
related
but
not
identical,
that
is
a
suit
"in
respect
to"
the
same
claim.
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
"in
respect
to"
is
not
immediately
apparent
but
it
does
suggest
the
broad
prohibition
on
redundant
lawsuits,
and
for
the
reasons
the
opinion
explains,
the
statutory
phrase
refers
to
facts,
not
remedies.
hence,
the
statute
bars
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
when
the
plaintiff
has
a
suit
based
on
substantially
the
same
operative
facts,
it's
pending
elsewhere
and
here,
the
nation's
two
suits
involve
almost
identical
operative
facts,
they
relate
to
the
same
trust
assets,
and
they
describe
almost
identical
alleged
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty.
the
court
of
federal
appeals'
action
--
the
court
of
federal
claims'
action
must
therefore
be
dismissed.
the
contrary
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
in
which
justice
breyer
joins.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
