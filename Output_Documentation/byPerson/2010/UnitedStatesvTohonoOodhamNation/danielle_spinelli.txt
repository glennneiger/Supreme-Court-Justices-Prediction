ms.
danielle
spinelli
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
suits
are
for
or
in
respect
to
the
same
claim
under
section
1500,
only
if
they
stem
from
the
same
operative
facts
and
seek
duplicative
relief.
and
in
response
to
the
government's
argument,
i
would
like
to
explain
why
that's
the
best
reading
of
section
1500's
text,
as
well
as
the
only
reading
that
harmonizes
section
1500
with
the
overall
jurisdictional
and
remedial
scheme.
congress
has
made
a
broad
range
of
remedies
available
to
plaintiffs
wronged
by
the
government.
and
it's
directed
plaintiffs
to
seek
certain
remedies
only
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
and
certain
remedies
only
in
the
district
court.
the
government's
reading
of
section
1500
assumes
that
congress
intended
to
penalize
plaintiffs
for
following
that
direction
by
barring
them
from
the
only
forum
where
they
can
obtain
money
damages.
but
nothing
in
the
statute's
text
or
history
suggests
that
congress
intended
to
create
such
a
nonsensical
scheme.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
justice
scalia,
it
is
disputed
whether
or
not
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
nation's
claims
there.
the
government
has
a
move
to
dismiss
on
that
ground,
that
motion
is
pending.
we
don't
believe
that
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
raised
in
the
district
court
is
a
question
that
this
court
needs
to
face.
rather,
the
question
here
is
whether
the
court
of
federal
claims
has
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
brought
in
the
cfc.
and
that
turns
not
on
whether
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction,
but
on
whether
duplicative
relief
is
sought
in
both
suits.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
no,
not
at
all,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
we
would
contest
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
the
relief
that
the
nation
sought
in
the
district
court.
we
believe
that
the
nation
is
entitled
to
that
relief.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
correct.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
correct.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
no,
no,
no.
you
are
right
that
it
could
not.
the
relief
that
is
being
sought
in
the
district
court
is
primarily
an
accounting.
an
accounting
is
inherently
an
equitable
remedy,
a
remedy
that
under
trust
law
the
trustee
owes
to
the
beneficiary
to
provide
the
beneficiary
with
all
the
information
necessary
for
him
to
protect
his
rights.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
that
may
well
be
the
case,
justice
kennedy,
in
common
law
trust
suits.
that
wasn't
requested--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--you
are
correct
that
normally,
that
in
the
past--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--correct.
you
are
correct
that
in
the
days
of
the
divided
bench
suit
for
breach
of
trust
were
brought
in
equity.
i
don't
think
we
need
to
parse
that
finely
here,
because
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
tribe
has
sought
duplicative
relief
in
both
courts.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
that
is
not
the
case.
the
accounting
has
enormous
benefit
entirely
apart
from
any
monetary
relief
that
it
might
ultimately
lead
to.
the
nation,
as
well
as
other
tribes
who
have
brought
these
kinds
of
suits,
lack
basic
information
about
what
they
own,
what
the
metes
and
bounds
of
their
lands
are,
what
leases
have
been
granted,
how
long
they
last,
what
easements
and
rights
of
way
have
been
granted
over
their
land,
what
the
status
is
of
their
mineral
rights
and
timber
rights.
all
of
this
is
information
that
the
tribe
needs
and
that
congress
recognized
in
the
indian
trust
fund
management
reform
act
that
the
tribe
needs
in
order
to
exercise
its
federally
granted
right
to
decide
how
it's
assets
are
best
managed,
and
the
longer
that
that
accounting
is
delayed,
the
more
the
nation
is
harmed
by
the
inability
to
do
that,
the
inability
to
decide
whether
certain
funds
should
be
withdrawn
from
trusts
held
by
the
united
states,
the
inability
to
decide
whether
it
should
bring
claims
against
third-parties.
so
there's
real
value
to
the
accounting
that's
entirely
separate
from
any
monetary
relief.
and
the
accounting
is
not
sought
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
the
court
of
federal
claims
has
long
held
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
to
grant
that
kind
of
pre-liability
historical
accounting.
although--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--the
court
of
federal
claims
can
order
something
called
an
accounting
in
aid
of
judgment.
despite
the
similar
terminology,
they
are
not
at
all
the
same.
an
accounting
of
the
type
that's
being
sought
in
the
district
court
is
a
remedy
by
itself.
it's
a
remedy
that
the
beneficiary
is
entitled
to
once
its
received
or
denied,
that's
a
final
order
that
can
be
appealed.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
it
is
because
it
requires
the
trustee
to
provide
all
information
about
the
trust
that
might
be
relevant
to
the
beneficiary,
and
it
does
so
without
requiring
the
beneficiary
to
prove
any
mismanagement.
by
contrast--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
is
being
asserted
in
the
district
court
is
the
apa,
that's
correct.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
in
the
district
court,
no.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
it's
a
little
bit
more
complicated--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--it's
a
little
bit
more
complicated
than
that
because
prior
to
--
prior
to
the
court
of
federal
claims
in
its
current
incarnation,
certain
claims
for
an
accounting
could
have
been
brought
before
the
indian
claims
commission,
but
--
i
mean
that's
going
a
little
far
afield.
the
--
at
any
rate
congress
has
now
recognized
specifically
by
statute
that
this
is
something
that
tribes
need,
and
that's
the
right
that
the
nation
is
seeking
to
enforce
in
the
district
court
action.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
no,
i'm
referring
to
the
1994
indian
trust
fund
management
reform
act,
which
specifically
required
the
department
of
the
interior
to
provide
tribal
beneficiaries
with
certain
statements,
certain
accountings
regarding
their--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--they
did
not
--
they
did
not
expressly
do
so,
no.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
no,
justice
kennedy,
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
as
a
close
reading
of
the
complaint
will
show,
the
nation
is
requesting
four
specific
kinds
of
relief.
first
it's
asking
for
damages
from
the
united
states'
failure
to
lease
its
mineral
rights
for
fair
market
value.
that's
count
1.
count
2
is
seeking
damages
from
the
united
states'
failure
to
obtain
fair
market
value
for
leases
of
its
land.
count
3
is
seeking
damages
from
the
united
states'
failure
to
invest
judgment
funds
in
a
timely
way
and
to
obtain
the
maximum
interest
rate;
and
count
4
asserts
a
similar
claim
for
damages
with
respect
to
the
trust
fund.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
it's
--
it's
not
just
interest,
you
are
correct.
i
mean,
maybe
if
i
give
an
example
this
will
make
things
a
little
bit
clearer.
say
that
the
government
sold
a
stand
of
timber
belonging
to
the
nation
for
$20,
even
though
the
stand
of
timber
was
worth
$40.
it
then
deposited
it
into
the
trust
account,
$10.
the
suit
in
the
district
court
seeks
an
accounting
and
a
restatement
of
the
accounts
and
to
the
extent
appropriate
and
available,
equitable
restitution
of
the
$10
that
was
missing
from
the
account.
the
suit
in
the
cfc
seeks
to
recover
the
$20
that
the
united
states
should
have
earned,
had
it
acted
as
a
prudent
fiduciary
when
it
was
selling
the
stand
of
timber.
and
the
nation
is
entitled
to
both
sums
of
money,
but
they
are
different,
and
because
the
money
sought
in
the
two
courts
is
different,
the
relief
is
not
duplicative.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
yes.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
yes.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
i
apologize.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
justice
breyer--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--justice
breyer,
you're
--
you
are
exactly
right
about
what
1491(a)(2)
provides,
but
it
also
provides
that
any
such
relief
can
be
ordered
only
as
an
incident
of
and
collateral
to
a
judgment
of
a
claim
of
which
the
court
of
federal
claims
otherwise
has
jurisdiction.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
and
notwithstanding
this
language--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--the
court
of
claims
has
continued
to
hold
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
to
grant
an
equitable
pre-liability
accounting.
all
that
it
can
do
is
after
liability
for
certain
acts
of
mismanagement
has
been
proven,
calculate
damages
for
those
specific
acts
of
mismanagement.
now--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--well,
two
--
two
things,
justice
sotomayor.
we
believe
that
the
nation
could
not
bring
the
old
money
claims
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
because
it
has
held
repeatedly
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
to
grant
an
equitable
accounting.
however,
i
don't
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
matters,
because
the
issue
here
is
not--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--dividing
--
well,
it
is
clear
that
the
accounting
sought
in
the
district
court
couldn't
have
been
obtained
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
it
made
sense
to
seek
the
old
money
as
the
court
of
appeals
called
it,
in
conjunction
with
the
accounting,
because
the
accounting
is
what
should
reveal
what
is
missing
from
the
account.
and
that's
the
reason,
and
not
for
any
manipulative
or
forum-shopping
purpose,
that
the
nation
split
its
complaint
the
way
it
did.
now
to
be
sure,
there
is
some
fuzziness
about
the
jurisdictional
line
between
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
the
district
court.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
the
nation
did
its
best
to
negotiate
that
and
filed
its
complaints
in
good
faith.
we
believe
that
that
question
doesn't
need
to
be
addressed
by
this
court,
because
the
only
question
section
1500
asks
is
whether
the
two
suits
are
for
or
in
respect
to
the
same
claim,
by
which
we
think
it
means
are
they
for
or
in
respect
to
the
same
demand
for
relief.
here--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
disagree.
i
think
that
action
by
congress
in
the
1972
remand
act
strongly
supports
the
conclusion
that
congress
has
implicitly
acquiesced
in
this
construction
of
section
1500.
congress
--
you
are
right,
congress
decided
not
to
say
go
ahead
with
your
two
suits
in
two
different
courts.
it
thought
that
was
too
burdensome
for
the
plaintiff;
rather
it
amended
the
tucker
act
to
permit
the
plaintiff
to
pursue
both
remedies
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
but
that
shows
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
casman
holding,
and
it
did
not
make
any
change
to
the
statute
to
cast
the
holding
into
doubt,
that
where
two
remedies
are
available
in
two
different
courts,
one
can
pursue
them
by
bringing
simultaneous
suits
in
the
two
different
courts.
all
that
it
did
is
make
it
easier
for
plaintiffs
in
that
specific
situation
to
get
full
relief.
beyond
that,
in
1982--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--no,
i
think
after
--
after
the
amendment--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--yes.
i
mean,
other
--
otherwise
that
would
raise
a
claim-splitting
problem.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
well,
i
mean,
clearly
the
easier
path
is
to
have
one
suit.
i
don't
think
any
plaintiff
wants
to
be
forced
to
bring
two
suits
to
obtain
two
different
remedies,
both
of
which
it
needs,
at
double
the
expense
and,
you
know,
double
the
anxiety.
but
i
think
what's
significant
about
the
1972
action
is
that
congress
did
absolutely
nothing
to
suggest
that
it
disagreed
with
the
casman
holding.
and
the
same
is
true
in
1982,
when
congress
completely
revamped
the
entire
jurisdictional
scheme,
changed
the
jurisdiction
of
the
claims
court
very
much,
and
yet
left
section
1500
entirely
untouched.
and
that
makes
sense.
i
mean,
just
to
turn
to
the
text
for
a
minute,
the
key
word,
as
i
think
this
court
said
in
keene,
is
the
word
"claim".
"claim"
can
mean
a
lot
of
different
things.
it
can
sometimes
mean
the
set
of
operative
facts
from
which
a
right
to
relief
arises,
which
i
believe
is
at
least
implicitly
what
the
government
is
saying.
it
can
also
mean
a
demand
for
relief;
for
instance,
in
this
court's
cases
regarding
article
3
standing,
it's
routinely
said
that
plaintiff
has
to
establish
standing
separately
for
each
claim,
which
means
for
each
form
of
relief
sought.
the
reason
that
is
the
correct
reading
of
section
1500
is
because
of
the
nature
of
the
jurisdictional
scheme.
the
court
of
federal
claims
has
always
been
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction.
it
can
only
grant
certain
remedies,
primarily
money
damages.
and
the
word
1500,
has
been
read
by
this
court
to
mean
a
demand
for
relief.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
yes,
i
think
the
definition
of
"claim"
in
the
federal
rules
--
i
think
that's
a
different
definition
of
"claim".
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
narrower
definition
that
was
first
established
in
the
19th
century
through
this
court's
decisions
construing
the
tucker
act
and
its
predecessors.
given
that
the
word
1500
as
having
the
same
meaning.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
i
don't
think
that
is
our
definition
of
"claim",
but
let
me
explain.
we
don't
dispute
that
certain
cotton
claimants,
you
know,
brought
writs
of
conversion
of
trespass.
some
may
have
brought
writs
of
replevin
or
detinue
seeking
the
cotton
itself
back.
the
relevant
fact
is
that
the
suit
saying
"i
want
my
100
bales
of
cotton
back.
"
and
the
suit
saying
"i
would
like
money
to
compensate
me
for
my
loss
of
100
bales
of
cotton.
"
seek
duplicative
relief.
and--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--the
word
1500
refers
to
claims
over
which
the
court
of
federal
claims
has
jurisdiction,
just
as
it
does
in
the
tucker
act.
there
is
no
express
limitation
in
the
tucker
act
on
the
relief
that
can
be
granted.
the
word
"claim"
has
been
read
implicitly
to
incorporate
a
limitation
on
the
kind
of
relief
that
can
be
granted.
therefore,
in
section
1500,
a
suit
for
or
in
respect
to
a
claim
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
must
mean
a
suit
for
or
in
respect
to
a
demand
for
relief
that
the
court
of
claims
can
grant,
and
where
duplicative
relief
is
being
sought,
that
falls
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
falls
within
the
overall
jurisdictional
scheme
which
directs
plaintiffs
to
bring
suits
for
different
relief
in
different
courts,
and
it
also
appears
with
cotton
claimants.
the
cotton
claimants
were
seeking
duplicative
relief,
and
that's
the
concern
that
congress
aimed
at.
congress
was
not
faced
in
1868
with
a
situation
in
which
plaintiffs
had
been
directed
to
seek
different
non-duplicative
remedies,
remedies
that
weren't
substitutes
for
one
another
but
complimented
one
another
in
two
different
courts.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
i
believe
we
do
know
it
was
always
duplicative,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
amount
that
one
might
recover
might
differ.
ms.
danielle
spinelli
that
is
not--
ms.
danielle
spinelli
--that
is
not
duplicative.
what
is
duplicative
is
a
remedy
that
is
either
the
same,
or
a
remedy
that
serves
as
a
substitute
for
another
remedy.
and
what
this
court
has
said,
though,
is
that
even
if
it's
not
a
completely
full
substitute
--
even
if,
say,
the
damages
sought
in
one
court
are
less
than
the
damages
sought
in
another
--
if
they
are
duplicative
relief
for
the
same
injury,
they
are
barred
by
section
1500.
and
i
think
that
is
completely
consistent
with
the
holding
in
keene.
in
keene,
the
plaintiff
was
bringing
multiple
suits
against
the
united
states
in
different
courts

claimants.
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
brought
some
of
those
suits
on
a
contract
theory
and
some
of
those
suits
on
an
equitable
tort
theory
of
indemnification,
the
statute
barred
those.
but
keene
was
not
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
the
plaintiffs
were
forced,
as
in
casman,
to
proceed
in
two
different
courts
to
obtain
different
relief.
and
another
particularly
good
example
is
an
example
of
a
regulatory
taking
suit,
in
which
if
a
plaintiff
wants
to
challenge
the
legality
of
government
regulation
affecting
his
property,
he
needs
to
do
that
in
the
district
court
under
the
apa.
and
according
to
the
government,
he
cannot
bring
a
suit
for
just
compensation
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
until
that
district
court
suit
is
completed
and
any
appeal
is
completed
and
any
cert
petition
is
completed,
by
which
time
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
on
the
just
compensation
claim
may
very
well
have
expired.

the

ms.

--there
are
a
couple
of
reasons
why
that
doesn't
work,

first
of
all,
the
nation
needs
the
accounting
now.
i
mean,
it's
as
if
in
casman,
casman
had
been
told,
well,
you
know,
first
get
reinstated
--
i'm
sorry
--
first
get
your
backpay;
then
go
get
reinstated.
he
needs
his
job
back
now
not
later
--
the
nation
needs
the
accounting
now,
not
later.
in
addition,
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
accounting
uncovered
additional
mismanagement,
this
statute
of
limitations,
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
might
well
expire
while
the
district
court
suit
for
an
accounting
is
pending,
those
suits
tend
to
last
a
very
long
time.
indeed
in
the
indian
claims
commission
they
have
been
known
to
last
for
up
to
50
years.
and
it
would
force
the
nation
to
run
the
risk
of
losing
its
right
to
damages.
we
don't
believe
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
it
doesn't
harmonize
section
1500
with
the
remainder
of
the
statutory
scheme.
it's
not
mandated
by
the
history
of
the
statute,
and
it
simply
doesn't
make
sense.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
we
ask
for
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
