justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-846,
united
states
v.
tohono
o'odham
nation.
mr.
yang.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
--
you
just--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but
it's
not
--
it's
not
as
broad
as
your
test,
"arising
out
of
the
same
operative
facts.
"
it
doesn't
say
that;
it
says
"any
claim
for
and
respect
to
which.
"
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
facts
of
this
case
draw
that
precise
distinction.
when
you
are
asking
for
an
accounting,
you
are
not
raising
any
claims
about
people
doing
anything
bad
at
all.
you
are
just
saying,
let
me
know
what
i've
got.
and
then
when
you
bring
a
claim
for
--
for
money
because
of
mismanagement
of
the
trust,
that's
--
that's
quite
different.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
--
is
that
to
assert
the
basis
about
why
an
accounting
should
be
required?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
--
maybe
i
don't
know
enough
about
what
an
accounting
is.
but
why
would
it
be
other
equitable
relief
to
which
they
are
entitled
if
they
simply
say,
we
want
to
know
what
we've
got?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
they
can
get
--
and
then
it
may
be
a
basis
for
a
further
claim
that,
if
that's
all
we've
got,
where
did
the
rest
of
it
go,
and
that
might
be
the
court
of
claims
action.
but
it
does
strike
me
that
they
are
different
--
claims
for
different
relief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
accounting
what
should
have
been
in
the
trust
fund
or
what
actually
is?
you
say
give
me
an
accounting
of
the
trust
fund.
does
the
officer
go
back
and
just
add
up
the
bank
accounts
and
value
the
land
and
all
that?
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--does
he
go
back
and
say,
well,
this
should
be
there
but
it's
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
going
forward.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
are
you
at
cross-purposes
on
those
two
issues?
when
it
comes
to
what
an
accounting
is,
you
want
to
say,
oh,
that's
just
going
forward;
when
it
comes
to
this
1500
question
you
want
to
say
they're
the
same
as
the
money
damages,
which
goes
backward?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
--
i
mean,
you
are
putting
a
pejorative
spin
on
what
they
are
doing,
saying,
you
know,
many
plaintiffs
like
to
take
a
chance
in
more
than
one
court.
but
your
response
to
justice
breyer
suggests
that
that's
a
tough
choice
if
you
have
to
choose
between
injunctive
relief
or
damages.
that's
not
them
trying
to,
you
know,
get
the
same
--
take
two
bites
at
the
apple.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
yang.
ms.
spinelli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you
get
the
accounting
in
conjunction
with
the
claim
of
damages?
maybe
the
court
of
federal
claims,
you
can't
go
there
and
say,
look,
i
want
an
accounting,
but
you
can
say
i
have
been
wronged
over
the
century
and
i
would
like
to
find
out
to
what
extent,
and
before
you
can
figure
that
out
you
actually
have
to
have
an
accounting.
can't
the
court
of
federal
claims
get
an
accounting
in
that
context?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
it's
a
remedy,
but
is
it
terribly
different
from
what
the
accounting
the
court
of
federal
claims
would
order
to
figure
out
how
much--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
yang,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
with
your
friend
that
there
are
differences
between
the
accounting
you
can
get
in
the
district
court
and
the
accounting
you
can
get
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
as
a
prelude
to
monetary
damages?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
yang,
ms.
spinelli.
the
case
is
submitted.
