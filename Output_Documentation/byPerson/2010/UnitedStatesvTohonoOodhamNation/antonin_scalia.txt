but
i
also
thought
that
the
court
of
claims
could
give--
justice
antonin
scalia
--could
be
brought--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
can
give
injunctive
relief
where
that's
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
extend
a
case
that
i
didn't
agree
with
when
it
came
out.
you
have
to
extend
bowen
in
order
to
achieve
that.
does
the
government
want
to
extend
bowen?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
complete
it
to
a
denial
of
recovery?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that's
any
comfort
to
the
indian
tribe,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
argument
assumes
that
there
is
available
in
the
district
courts
injunctive
relief
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
that
is
far
from
clear,
even
after
bowen,
it's
far
from
clear
if
you
had
any
business
being
in
the
district
court
anyway.
and
so
in
a
way
we
are
resolving
a
very
strange
question,
that
is
if
as
is
not
clear,
you
have
a
right
to
sue
in
the
district
courts
for
an
injunction,
can
that
suit
proceed
because
of
1500
when
there
is
a
suit
pending
in
the
court
of
claims
and
that
is
sort
of
an
abstract
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
unrealistic?
you
don't
want
an
accounting
for
the
sake
of
having
an
accounting
so
that
you
can
put
the
accounting
in
your
desk.
oh,
look
it,
they
stole
$1,000,000,000
from
us.
you
want
to
get
the
$1,000,000,000.
if
the
suits
are
directed
at
the
same
object,
and
it
is
fanciful
to
think
there
is
this
separate
suit
for
an
accounting.
the
object
of
that
suit
is
the
same
thing
as
the
object
of
the
suit
in
the
court
of
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
were
those
accountings
available
before
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
passed?
is
the
jurisdictional
basis
for
that
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
allows
you
to
demand
an
accounting
from
the
united
states?
is
that
just
the
apa?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
didn't
have
a
right
to
that
before
the
apa
was
passed?
justice
antonin
scalia
either
in
the
district
court
nor
in
the
court
of
claims.
so
this
is
not
an
unthinkable
situation,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
thought
about
for
a
century,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
have
--
you
say
congress
has
specifically
recognized
it
by
statute.
you're
referring
to
the
apa?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
did
not
provide
for
a
lawsuit
against
--
against
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me,
it
didn't
make
it
easier.
you
--
you
had
to
bring
them
both
in
the
court
of
claims,
no?
you
didn't
still
have
the
option
of
--
of
still
bringing
two
different
suits,
did
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
had
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
if
they
were
just
making
it
easier,
they
--
they
would
have
said,
you
know,
you
can
do
either
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
give
it
that
narrow
meaning,
however,
the
government
says
you
are
contradicting
what
was
the
case
with
regard
to
the
cotton
suits.
that,
in
fact,
some
of
them
were
asking
for
funds
from
this
--
money
from
this
common
fund,
and
others
were
seeking
relief
against
the
individuals
who
had
taken
the
cotton
or
replanted
the
cotton.
those
are
different
claims,
as
you
define
"claim",
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
different
from
the
word
"claim".
i
mean,
if
you
are
hanging
the
whole
thing
on
the
word
"claim",
you
gave
me
a
very
plausible
alternate
definition
of
"claim".
but
your
case
does
not
follow
that.
your
case
hinges
on
duplicative
relief,
which
is
something
quite
different.
i
don't
know
any
definition
of
"claim"
that
is
synonymous
with
duplicative
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
even
know
who
has
hunting
leases
and--
