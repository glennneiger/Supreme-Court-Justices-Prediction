chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
term
in
case
09-907,
ransom
v.
fia
card
services.
mr.
burke.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
they
get
it
whether
or
not
they
incur
that
expense
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
food,
you
don't
have
to
say,
well,
he
did
spend
this
much
money
on
food,
so
he
gets
the
same
deduction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
he
doesn't
eat
as
much
as
somebody
else
he
gets
the
same
deduction,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
maynard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
they
have
prepurchased
their
food
expenses,
so
long
as
they
have
one
dollar
of
food
expense
they
get
the
entire
expense
even
though
they
are
not
incurring
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
there
are
things
like,
you
can
pay
up,
you
know,
have
the
grocery
deliver
your
food
every
month
and
you
can
pay
in
advance,
and
if
you
paid
up
you
still
get
the
full
food
expense
that
is
allowed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
you
paid
1
dollar
for
food
you
would
get
the
full
amount
for
60
months?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
argument
leads
to
a
result
that
is
just
as
absurd
as
your
colleague's
result
on
the
other
side.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
that
was
a
big
part
of
your
argument.
you
said
his
position
leads
to
an
absurd
result,
and
yours
is
just
as
absurd.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
--
your
position
penalizes
debtors
who
pay
their
expenses
in
advance,
who
don't
incur
additional
debt
to
pay
for
things
like
their
car.
i
would
have
thought
the
bankruptcy
code
would
think
that's
a
good
thing,
that
they
are
not
incurring
debt
that
they
can't
afford
to
pay
off,
but
instead,
to
the
extent
they
can,
they
are
paying
expenses
in
advance.
why
should
somebody
who
does
that
be
in
a
worse
position
than
somebody
--
somebody
who
takes
out
a
loan
they
can't
afford
to
pay
back?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he
hasn't
incurred
--
he
hasn't
incurred
expenses.
it's
the
whole
point,
i
guess,
that
he's
paid
for
something.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
he
can
do
it
--
even
though
he
can
do
it
for
everything
else:
he
can
do
it
for
food,
he
can
do
it
for
housekeeping
expenses,
he
can
do
it
for
personal
care
expenses,
he
can
even
do
it
--
the
other,
the
final
category
is
miscellaneous,
so
he
can
do
it
for
anything.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you
finish
answering
the
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
saharsky?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
he
pays--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
he
paid
a
dollar,
he
would
be
able
to
shield
$27,999,
and
you
are
comfortable
with
that
result.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
understood
your
brief
to
say
it
was
the
amount
--
you
get
the
whole
amount,
not
simply
as
a
cap.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
point
of
the
$1,
counsel,
is
to
lead
to
the
extreme
hypothetical
that
would
flesh
out
your
position,
what
if
it
were
$10,000
and
the
amount
would
give
him
$30,000?
the
trustees
have
probably
seen
loans
like
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
saharsky,
i
should
probably
know
this,
but
if
you
do
have
amounts
that
are
excluded
from
the
disposable
income
because
of
car
ownership,
in
other
words,
you
actually
have,
in
your
point
of
view,
expenses,
do
they
have
to
go
to
the
pay
off
the
car
loan
or
are
they
available
for
everybody?
all
the
creditors?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
there
is
more
food
expense
than
is
allowed,
can
he
decide
of
the
amount
that
would
otherwise
go
for
the
car
payment
that
he
is
going
to
pay
some
of
that
for
the
food
expenses?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
burke,
have
you
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
