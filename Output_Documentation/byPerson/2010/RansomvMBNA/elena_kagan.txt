mr.
burke,
if
we
could
stay
with
this.
the
$471
is
derived
by
looking
at
the
average
loan
or
lease
payments
nationwide.
then
in
addition
to
that
we
know
that
the
irs
has
a
separate
category
for
operating
costs
that
is
meant
to
reflect
costs
of
having
a
car
that
are
not
your
loan
and
lease
payments.
so
between
those
two
things,
why
wouldn't
we
say
that
ownership
costs
means
your
loan
and
lease
payments,
but
operating
costs
means
your
other
costs
of
having
a
car,
and
that
you
get
the
operating
costs
if
you
have
a
car
but
don't
make
loan
and
lease
payments
and
you
get
the
ownership
costs
if
you
do
make
loan
and
lease
payments?
justice
elena
kagan
for
example,
mr.
burke,
what
would
happen
if
you
didn't
actually
have
any
out-of-pocket
medical
costs?
could
you
still
claim
a
deduction
for
out-of-pocket
medical
costs?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
burke,
even
you
would
say
--
is
this
correct
--
that
if
you
don't
own
a
car
at
all
you
can't
claim
the
car
costs?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
burke,
if
the
table
said
loan
and
lease
costs,
you
wouldn't
have
a
case?
if
it
said,
instead
of
ownership
costs,
if
it
said
loan
and
lease
costs,
then
you
would
sit
down
and
you
would
say
i'm
not
entitled
to
that
deduction?
justice
elena
kagan
even
if
it's
called
loan
and
lease
costs?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
maynard,
what
would
happen
if
the
debtor
had
a
car
that
was
200,000
miles
old
--
200,000
miles,
and
it
was
going
to
break
down,
you
know,
within
the
next
5
years?
would
the
debtor
then
be
able
to
take
the
deduction?
justice
elena
kagan
even
though
if
you
look
ahead,
if
you
project
forward,
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
debtor
is
going
to
have
to
incur
those
expenses?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
the
modification
works
for
chapter
13
but
it
doesn't
work
for
chapter
7;
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
saharsky,
could
you
explain
to
me
the
government's
position
on
when
a
debtor
with
loan
and
lease
payments
gets
to
deduct
them
under
romanette
ii?
in
other
words,
this
goes
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
the
notwithstanding
clause
and
whether
the
notwithstanding
clause
effectively
excludes
all
loan
and
lease
payments
from
romanette
ii?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
in
other
words,
the
loan
and
lease
payments
don't
count
as
debt
for
purposes
of
the
notwithstanding
clause,
they
count
as
expense
amounts?
justice
elena
kagan
this
case
is
about
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
in
what's
called
chapter
13
bankruptcy,
a
person
can
get
relief
from
all
his
debts
in
exchange
for
an
agreement,
an
agreement
to
repay
his
creditors
a
certain
amount
of
his
future
income
for
the
next
several
years.
the
bankruptcy
code
instructs
a
person
in
this
situation
how
to
calculate
the
exact
amount
that
he
has
to
repay
his
creditors.
the
code
says
to
that
person,
first,
you
take
your
current
income
then
you
deduct
certain
defined
living
expenses.
those
defined
expenses,
the
bankruptcy
code
says,
are
set
amounts,
not
necessarily
your
actual
expenses,
but
set
amounts
that
the
irs
decides
are
reasonable
for
various
necessary
things
like
housing,
or
transportation,
or
food.
you
deduct
those
expenses
from
your
income
and
what's
left
over
is
the
amounts
that
you
are
required
to
repay
creditors.
now,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
bankruptcy
code
allows
a
debtor,
who's
making
this
calculation,
to
deduct
an
expense
that
he
simply
does
not
have.
the
expense
at
issue
is
for
car
ownership.
the
irs,
and
again
that's
the
agency
that's
authorized
to
set
these
reasonable
expenses.
the
irs
says
that
the
average
loan
or
lease
payment
for
a
car
nationwide
is
$471
a
month.
and
so
the
irs
says,
that's
the
amount
that
a
person
typically
can
deduct
in
chapter
13
bankruptcy.
that's
the
amount
of
the
car-ownership
deduction.
the
petitioner
here,
whose
name
is
jason
ransom,
he
claims
this
deduction
even
though
he
owned
his
car
free
and
clear,
and
he
didn't
in
fact
make
any
loan
or
lease
payments
on
this
car.
and
claiming
this
deduction,
allowed
him
to
shield
about
$28,000
that
he
otherwise
would've
had
to
pay
his
creditors
over
the
life
of
his
bankruptcy
plan.
and
he
took
the
car-ownership
deduction
in
addition
to
claiming
another
deduction
that
the
irs
sets
for
car-operating
costs
like
fuel,
and
insurance,
and
repairs.
so
one
of
his
creditors,
perhaps
not
surprisingly,
objected.
that
creditor
said
that
mr.
ransom
wasn't
eligible
to
claim
the
car-ownership
deduction
because
he
didn't
in
fact
incur
any
car-ownership
costs.
today,
we
hold
that
this
was
a
valid
objection,
that
mr.
ransom
was
not
entitled
to
this
deduction
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
we
reached
this
conclusion
by
looking
closely
at
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute
authorizes
a
debtor
to
deduct,
“his
applicable
monthly
expense
amounts
that
are
set
by
the
irs.”
"applicable,"
if
you
go
and
you
look
it
up
in
the
dictionary,
means
appropriate,
or
relevant,
or
fit
and
we
conclude
that
when
the
statute
says,
“applicable
expense
amounts”,
what
the
statute
means
is
the
expense
amounts
or
deductions,
that's
another
word
for
it,
the
deductions
that
are
appropriate
for
that
debtor.
and
the
deductions
that
are
appropriate
for
that
debtor
are
the
ones
that
correspond
to
his
own
financial
circumstances.
so
a
person
who
doesn't
have
any
car-ownership
expenses
can't
take
a
deduction
for
car
ownership.
we
also
think
that
this
understanding
of
the
statutory
language
accords
with
the
context
and
purpose
of
the
statute.
other
provisions
of
the
statute
made
clear
that
congress
intended
the
deductions
to
approximate
the
debtor's
reasonable
expenditures
on
basic
necessities.
and
congress'
essential
purpose
in
enacting
this
part
of
the
code
was
to
ensure
that
debtors
who
can
pay
creditors
do
pay
them.
so
once
again,
we
think
this
means
that
a
person
like
mr.
ransom
who
doesn't
have
any
car-ownership
expenses
shouldn't
be
able
to
deducts
them
when
calculating
how
much
he
has
available
to
repay
creditors.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
which
previously
disapproved
this
deduction.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
