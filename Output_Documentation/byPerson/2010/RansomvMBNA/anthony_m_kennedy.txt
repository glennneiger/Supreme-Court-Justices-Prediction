is
that
the
general
view
of
the
courts?
is
the
answer
that
you
just
gave
supported
uniformly
by
the
courts
that
have
looked
at
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
even
on
this
point
they
are
split?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question,
incidentally,
about
courts
was
not
with
reference
to
the
car
expense.
it
was
in
reference
to
the
hypothetical
or
to
the
issue
proposed
by
one
of
my
colleagues,
that
said,
justice
kagan,
suppose
you
don't
have
the
medical
expense,
and
the
answer
--
and
your
--
and
i
wanted
to
know
if
your
answer
is
supported
uniformly
by
the
courts
that
have
looked
at
this
or
if
there
is
also
a
split
on
that
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
would
your
answer
be
the
same
if
the
allowance
was
set,
the
decree
was
made,
and
the
debtor
then
went
out
and
bought
the
junker
to
put
in
his
driveway
just
in
order
to
get
the
400-plus
dollars
a
month,
or
would
that
be
deemed
an
evasion
of
the
law
that
could
be
addressed
by
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
paradigm
of
someone
--
we
are
comparing
someone
who
has
a
$470-a-month
car
payment
and
he
gets
--
and
he
gets
the
deduction.
why
is
that,
in
light
of
the
second
sentence
--
let's
see,
the
third
sentence
of
the
statute,
which
says,
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
this
clause,
the
monthly
expenses
of
the
debtor
shall
not
include
any
payments
for
debts.
"
i
mean,
that
would
be
the
car
company.
has
that
point
been
litigated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
it
would
--
it
would
eliminate
the
anomaly
that
--
one
of
the
principal
anomalies.
there
are
many
anomalies
in
each
position.
it
would
eliminate
one
of
the
principal
asymmetries
that
seems
to
concern
the
counsel
and
the
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
--
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
excuse
me,
chief
justice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
the
--
but
the
gravamen
of
justice
scalia's
question
is:
why
are
you
running
away
from
1a,
which
is
what
respondent's
counsel
relied
on?
and
if
that
were
clearly
relevant
to
this
statute,
it
would
seem
to
me
to
answer
the
question.
are
you
saying
we
--
we
don't
look
at
this
because
it's
just
simply
an
interpretation,
it's
not
a
regulation?
what
is
--
what
is
--
in
your
view,
what
effect
do
we
give
to
this
language
that
justice
scalia
quoted?
nothing
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
--
suppose
we
think
the
word
"applicable"
is
ambiguous
and
difficult
to
construe.
do
we
then
look
at
this
language
at
1a,
or
do
you
say
it
is
irrelevant
in
all
instance
--
in
all
--
in
all
respects?
