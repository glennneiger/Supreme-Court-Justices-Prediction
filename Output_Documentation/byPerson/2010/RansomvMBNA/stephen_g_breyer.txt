justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
do.
you
do,
but
the
difficulty
that
i
--
i
don't
get
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
first
question.
of
course
you
have
all
kinds
of
costs
dealing
with
ownership,
but
what
the
irs
says,
what
it
says
in
the
statute,
is
you
are
supposed
to
take
the
applicable
costs
from
irs.
and
what
it
has
on
page
5a
is
it
has
something
called
ownership
costs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
defines
those
as
$471.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
on
3a,
where
it
says
what
ownership
costs
are,
it
says
"the
transportation
standards
consist
of
nationwide
figures
for
monthly
loan
or
lease
payments,
referred
to
as
ownership
costs.
"
so
when
i
read
that,
i
said:
ownership
costs
means
monthly
loan
or
lease
payments,
nothing
else.
now,
you
have
all
kinds
of
other
things.
it's
just
these
words
"ownership
costs"
don't
refer
to
those
other
things,
because
of
that
definition
given
right
there.
that's
what
i
thought
justice
ginsburg
was
initially
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
how
do
you
get
out
of
that
what
i
think
of
as
very,
very
clear
language
which
says
what
these
standards
refer
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
it
doesn't
--
for
example,
suppose
you
buy
a
dozen
apples
every
month
and
they
cost
you
$48
extra.
you
are
not
going
to
say
the
ownership
costs
refer
to
the
apples,
even
if
you
decorate
the
car
with
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
ownership
costs
refers
to
lease
and
loan
payments.
nothing
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
something
wrong
with
the
irs
saying
what
they
mean?
it
says
"ownership
costs
means
monthly
loan
or
lease
payments.
"
now,
is
there
something--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what
it
says
it
means.
now,
is
there
something
illegal
about
it
defining
ownership
costs
in
that
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
--
we've
got
about
half
the
courts
in
the
country
agreeing
with
you.
and
so
you've
read
all
those
arguments,
and
what
in
your
opinion
is
the
best
one
on
the
point,
again,
where
i
am
stuck,
which
is
justice
ginsburg's
original
point.
i
mean,
i
can
think
of
millions
of
examples.
you
have
a
form
that
says
the
employer
says
entertainment
expenses
and
it
defines
entertainment
expenses
as
food
and
transport,
and
they
leave
out
movies,
you
know.
or
you
could
have
vacation
expenses
and
vacation
expenses
are
defined
as
transport
and
hotel,
and
they
leave
out
meals.
and
here
we
have
a
definition
of
ownership
expenses
and
they
say
leasing
and
loaning
and
they
leave
out
other
forms
of
ownership.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
the
argument
is,
well,
that's
what
they
mean
by
it,
so
that's
what
applicable.
now,
what's
the
best
argument
against
that
in
those
50
cases?
why
is
it
trying
--
why
to
try
to
get
an
expense
which
isn't
loan
or
lease?
have
you
any
more
right
to
it
than
if
you
tried
to
get
an
expense
to
my
totally
irrelevant
apples?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
fit
within
the
applicable
definition.
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
looked
at
the
form.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ownership.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
two
pages
earlier
they
say
what
they
mean
by
the
word
"ownership".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
half
the
courts
say,
oh,
you
just
sort
of
imagine
what
ownership
expenses
are
and
anything
that
they
can
fall
within
that
general
english
language
word
is
what
they
can
deduct;
is
that
their
approach?
because
if
you
go
longer
you
say
cut
off
the
definition,
cut
off
the
definition
from
the
word
"ownership",
don't
use
it.
so
what
do
we
use
to
define
what
ownership
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
it's
for
ownership,
it's
not
for,
for
example,
whistling;
it's
for
ownership.
so
how
do
we
define
what
that
$471
attaches
to?
do
we
use
a
state
common
law
definition
or
something?
how
have
they
done
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
don't
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
--
sorry,
are
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
finish,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
it
is
--
well,
i'm
trying
to
work
out
what
was
his
point.
and
i
don't
blame
him
for
this.
but
trying
to
figure
it
out,
he
says
look:
this
whole
thing
was
written
for
a
different
purpose
than
the
irs
and
if
we
start
reading
all
those
things
from
the
beginning
into
the
tables
we
are
really
going
to
get
into
a
mess.
for
example,
we
are
going
to
give
people
deductions
when
they
have
lease
payments,
even
though
they
are
not
owners
when
they
have
lease
payments.
the
company
owns
--
not
even
an
ownership
expense,
but
it
does
say
use
the
lease
payment,
and
then
it
has
all
these
other
things.
so
forget
it;
do
a
simple
thing.
it
says
ownership
expense.
you
go
to
the
registry
of
motor
vehicles
and
you
say,
is
smith
the
owner?
and
they
will
tell
you,
yes
or
no.
and
if
the
answer
is
yes,
he
deducts
$471.
sometimes
that's
too
little,
sometimes
that's
too
much.
but
once
we
depart
from
that,
we
are
really
in
a
nightmare
of
trying
to
figure
out
what
all
these
things
mean
that
were
written
for
other
purposes.
so
what
do
you
say
to
that?
