justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
that
the
crux
of
it?
congress
made
reference
to
the
local
standards,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
were
the
--
was
the
commentary
in
the
collection
financial
standards
in
existence
at
the
time
when
congress
enacted
this
provision?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that
explains
what
the
irs
understands
the
local
standards
to
mean;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that,
but
congress
decided
to
make
reference
to
the
local
standards
in
this
bankruptcy
provision,
didn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
this
--
and
at
the
time
when
it
did
that,
there
was
official
irs
commentary
regarding
the
meaning
of
those
standards,
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
your
argument
is
that
congress
intended
to
adopt
the
standards
promulgated
by
the
irs,
but
not
the
irs's
interpretation
of
the
standards.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
look
at
the
local
standard,
which
is
on
page
8
of
the
appendix
to
your
brief,
right?
and
all
it
says
is
"ownership
costs,
first
car,
$471.
"
that's
the
relevant
text,
isn't
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
a
person
leases
a
car?
do
you
think
they
get
ownership
costs?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
they
don't
own
the
car,
so
how
can
they
get
ownership
costs?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
do
you
get
that,
from
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
collection
financial
standards?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
do
you
get
the
definition
that
somebody
who
leases
something
owns
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
how
do
they
get
ownership
costs?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
somebody
rents
an
apartment,
do
they
own
the
apartment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
you
own
a
car
but
it's
completely
inoperable
and
it
has
no
value.
you
buy
it
for
a
dollar.
it's
a
junk
car
and
you
are
planning
possibly
to
restore
it
at
some
point.
do
you
get
the
deduction
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
--
what
if
the
definition
of--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--ownership
costs
was
moved
into
the
local
standards
themselves?
would
the
outcome
be
different
then.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
it's
moved
from
the
cfs
to
the
local
standards,
which
are
referred
to
in
the
code
provision.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that
the
bankruptcy
code
provision
freezes
the
national
and
local
standards
to
some
degree
or
completely
as
they
existed
at
the
time
when
the
statute
was
enacted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
irs
can
change,
otherwise
going
forward
they
could
completely
change
the
national
and
local
standards?
