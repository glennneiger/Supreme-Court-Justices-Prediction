doesn't
the
chart
say
"ownership
costs"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
would
read
that
to
mean
non-costs
as
well?
i
mean,
if
the
--
if
the
table
is
called
ownership
costs,
then
why
not
use
the
irs's
definition
of
what
costs
are;
and
that
definition
says
what,
loan
payments
and
lease
payments?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
burke,
before
you
respond
to
that
question,
isn't
it
so
that
in
the
event
that
justice
scalia
just
proposed,
the
trustee
could
propose
an
amendment
to
the
plan
to
reflect
that
that
cost
is
no
longer
being
incurred?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question
is:
in
the
situation
that
justice
scalia
proposed,
it's
not
automatic
that
this
$471
gets
deducted
because
there
could
be
proposed
an
amendment
of
the
claim
to
reflect
that
that
--
there
is
no
longer
any
expense
for
ownership.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
automatic
that
because
there's
one
payment,
then
forever,
the
rest
of
the
5
years,
he
gets
to
deduct
the
$471.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not
--
it
says
you
are
suppose
to
look
at
the
costs;
it's
ownership
costs.
so
the
only
thing
you'd
look
at
the
irs
for
is,
the
manual,
is
to
define
ownership
costs.
and
they
say
ownership
costs
means
those
two
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
follow
that.
if
the
simple
thing
is
to
just
--
what
does
the
word
"costs"
mean?
and
then
you
look
to
the
irs
manual
and
it
tells
you
that
the
cost
means
loan
or
lease
payments.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
burke,
the
--
it's
unusual
to
allow
a
deduction
for
the
purpose
of
calculating
disposable
income
although
you
don't
have
any
expense.
i
understand
how
you
get
to
that
conclusion
with
respect
to
car
ownership.
is
there
any
other
provision
that
in
calculating
disposable
income
you
are
allowed
a
deduction
for
an
expense
that
you
don't
incur?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
the
question,
is
there
anything
else
that
works
like
this?
you
don't
have
the
expense,
nonetheless
you
have
the
deduction?
any
--
i
mean,
there
are
a
whole
list
of
deductions,
expenses.
is
there
any
other
one
that
works
this
way?
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
have
the
expense,
in
fact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
may
want
to
save
the
rest
of
your
time
for
rebuttal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
--
the
general
position
was
you
get
either
the
actual
payment
or
the
471,
of
whichever
is
higher.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
burke,
would
you
explain
one
facet
of
this
case
to
me.
given
the
deduction,
the
$471
deduction,
projected
disposable
income
comes
down
to
$210?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
opposed
to
it
would
be
$600
some
if
you
didn't
count
the
$471?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
the
disposable
income
figure
was
$210,
the
debtor
was
willing
--
the
debtor
proposed
paying
$500.
why
did
the
debtor
come
up
with
a
$500
figure
when
projected
disposable
income
without
the
car
ownership
would
be
--
if
he
gets
the
car
ownership
would
only
be
$210?
