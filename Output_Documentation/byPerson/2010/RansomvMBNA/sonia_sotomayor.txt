do
they
apply
--
do
the
courts
apply
the
housing
and
utilities
listed
amount
whether
or
not
you
pay
for
a
house
or
not,
whether
or
not
you
rent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--food
costs,
housing
costs,
utility
costs,
by
getting
his
parents
to
pay
for
those
things
and
still
take
this
deduction?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
adversary
said
that
only
two
courts
have
addressed
this
issue
and
have
permitted
those
deductions.
so
under
what
reasoning
would
we
apply
a
different
standard
to
the
car
costs
as
opposed
to
those
other
costs?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
housing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
debtor's
monthly
expenses
shall
be
the
debtor's
applicable
monthly
expense
amount
specified
under
the
national
and
local
standards.
so
the
national
and
local
standards
have
amounts
listed.
where
does
it
say
you
take
only
the
actual,
not
the
national
or
local
standards?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
--
but
that's
not
what
the
provision
at
issue
here
says.
it
says
you
use
the
amount
specified
under
the
national
standards
and
you
use
actual
for
everything
else.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
so
now
you
are
trying
to
move
the
actual
into
the
first
half
of
the
test?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
would
you
even
bother?
why
don't
you
--
if
--
if
what
you
are
arguing
is
that
only
actual
expenses
are
--
are
what
you
can
claim,
you
wouldn't
need
the
first
half.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
you
would
have
the
statute
read
is:
the
debtor's
monthly
expenses
shall
be
the
debtor's
applicable
monthly
expense
amount
specified,
as
a
--
as
a
maximum.
you
would
have
to
add
"maximum"
somewhere
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
you
are
proposing
is
that
every
debtor
has
to
go
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
show
what
their
monthly
food
bills
have
been
over
what
period
of
time,
how
much
their
personal
supplies
have
been
over
what
period
of
time?
how
can
you
calculate
forward
what
they
are
going
to
spend
on
a
monthly
basis
for
each
of
those
items?
isn't
that
the
reason
the
tables
are
used,
so
that
you
don't
have
to
do
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
then
you
would
be
comfortable
with
a
person
who
owns
a
house
outright
who
only
pays
$100
in
utilities
taking
the
full
amount
of
the
housing
and
utilities
allowable
living
expenses
because
that's
the
amount
specified?
