ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
only
question
this
court
needs
to
resolve
in
this
case
is
whether
the
vehicle
ownership
expense
is
applicable
to
petitioner.
the
answer
is
no.
the
ownership
cost
is
for
loan
and
lease
payments,
the
cost
to
acquiring
the
vehicle,
and
he
just
doesn't
have
any
payments
of
that
type.
to
allow
him
to
pretend
that
he
does
would
create
absurd
results.
he
would
be
able
to
shield
approximately
$28,000
from
his
unsecured
creditors,
and
he
would
be
better
off
than
lower
income
chapter
13
debtors.
and
we
just
don't
think
that
that's
a
result
that
congress
intended.
we
don't--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
that
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
the
amount
in
the
table
is
the
amount
to
be
used
or
a
cap
on
actual
expenses.
in
our
view,
it
is--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that's
right.
now,
of
course,
we
haven't
seen
--
the
executive
office
for
u.s.
trustees
has
not
seen
any
$1
payments.
it
doesn't
know
of
any
such
commercially
available
payments.
it
suspects
the
payments
would
be--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
an
expense
amount
is
a
standard
amount,
but
you
still
need
to
make
a
threshold
showing
that
it's
applicable
to
you.
and
if
i
could
give
the
court
one
example:
when
an
individual
does
his
federal
income
tax
forms,
you
can
take
a
deduction
for
your
dependents,
but
you
can't
just
take
a
deduction
for
any
child
you
have.
you
have
to
take
a
deduction
--
you
can
take
a
deduction
if
the
person
lives
at
home
with
you
for
more
than
one
year
and
have
you
a
certain
amount
of
expenses
to
support
them,
and
that
is
a
standard
deduction
that
you
get
on
your
tax
forms.
the
irs
doesn't
ask
everyone
to
figure
out
their
actual
costs.
it
is
the
case
in
real
life
that
there
are
allowance
amounts
that
are
average
amounts
that
are
given
to
people
once
they
meet
the
criteria.
and
that's
what
we
are
saying
happens
here.
now,
that
is,
again,
only
a
disagreement
as
to
what
you
do
with
people
who
actually
have
vehicle
ownership
expenses.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
because,
your
honor,
in
that
case
it's
the
irs
commentary
we
are
referring
to
that
is
on
page
1a
of
the
red
brief
appendix.
and
that
--
what
that's
referring
to
is,
it
says
the
amount
actually
spent
or
the
standard.
and
that's
distinguishing
between
the
amount
that
is
actually
spent
or
the
standard,
which
is
the
standard--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--amount
in
the
table.
right.
and
of
course,
we
look
to
what
--
the
text
that
congress
enacted
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
that
says
that
the
debtor's
monthly
expenses
shall
be
the
debtor's
applicable
monthly
expense
amounts
specified
under
the
national
standards
and
local
standards.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
that
it
would
further
congress's
purposes
to
say
that
you
have
to
--
that
you
look
to
the
actual
costs
that
the
debtor
has.
but
we
just
don't
think
the
text
goes
that
far,
because
it
says
that
if
the
expense
amounts,
the
category,
is
applicable
to
the
debtor,
that
then
you
use
the
expense
amounts
specified
under
the
table.
but--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--it
would
not
be
relevant
in
the
bankruptcy
context,
in
our
view,
and
the
reason
is
because
the
statutory
text
refers
to
the
standards.
and
in
our
view,
you
can
look
to
the
irs
commentary
to
see
what
the
standards
mean,
what
their
scope
is,
as
justice
breyer
was
discussing
with
his
apples
hypothetical.
but
this
additional
language
is
guidance
to
irs
agents
in
tax
delinquency
cases
about
how
to
collect
taxes.
as
petitioners--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--you
--
your
honor,
you
could
look
at
this
language,
but
we
think
that
it
reflects
not
the
standards,
but
what
--
how
the
irs
uses
the
standards
in
individual
cases
of
tax
delinquency.
to
the
extent
that
the
irs
is
defining
what
the
standards
are,
what
the
scope
of
the
standards
are
--
for
example,
that
ownership
costs
are
loan
and
lease
payments
--
of
course
we
would
think
that
you
would
look
to
that,
but
this
additional
guidance
to
irs
agents
we
don't
think
is
what
congress
meant
when
it
said
"expense
amounts
specified
under
the
standards.
"
but
we
do
think
that
the
text
could
be
read
the
way
you
suggest.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
the
housing
and
utilities
expenses
have
been
broken
out
into
a
mortgage
and
rent
component
and
utilities
component.
so
in
that
circumstance
we
would
say
the
individual
only
is
allowed
the
utilities
component,
but
it
would
be
the
allowance
amount
that
is
specified,
it
would
not
be
this
actual
amount.
but
again,
this
was
a
question
that
was
not
considered
by
the
courts
below.
in
fact,
the
bankruptcy
appellate
panel
said
in
footnote
20
of
its
brief,
said
this
question
is
not
in
this
case,
it's
not
before
us
whether
you
use
the
actual
amounts
in
the
table
or
whether
you
use
the
actual
amounts.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
they
are
not
available
for
the
creditors.
the
idea
behind
this
calculation
is
that
there,
of
course,
are
secured
debts
that
have
priority
and
then
this
calculation
is
used
to
figure
out
how
much
money
is
left
to
pay
unsecured
creditors,
and
the
idea
is
that
the
debtor
has
certain
expenses,
that
he
needs
to
keep
money
for
himself
so
he
can
continue
with
the
every
day
business
of
life.
for
example,
the
car
ownership
payment
is
designed
to
ensure
that
a
vehicle
can
still
use
and
have
access
to
a
car,
and
if
someone
has
a
loan
or
lease
payment
they
need
to
be
able
to
continue
making
that
payment
in
bankruptcy,
but
if
they
don't
have
any
such
payment
then
they
don't
have
this
additional
need
for
additional
funds.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
certainly
the
bankruptcy
court
doesn't
scrutinize,
you
know,
what
happens
to
that
regard.
what
it's
just
trying
to
do
is
figure
out
the
disposable
income
that
is
available
to
pay
unsecured
creditors
that
the
debtor
doesn't
need.
and
i
should
just
note
with
respect
to
this
question
of
whether
there
is
an
overall
budget
that
the
debtor
is
allowed,
you
know,
that
is
certainly
not
the
case
in
any
of
the
other
provisions
that
follow
this
applicable
monthly
standards
and
local
standards.
you
have
the
actual
other
necessary
expenses,
actual
continuation
of
taking
care
of
chronically
ill
family
members,
and
petitioner
himself
acknowledges
that
he
has
to
show
that
he
has
a
car.
so
it's
not
the
case
that
every
debtor
is
just
getting
some
set
amount
of
money
to
do
what
they
will
with.
congress
has
referenced
the
standards,
the
standards
break
this
out
into
certain
expenses,
it
says
just
take
the
applicable
ones
and
we
just
don't
think
it
makes
sense
to
interpret
applicable
in
that
circumstance.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
it
does
not
have
that
affect,
your
honor.
what
it
does
is
to
take
out
the
actual
debt
payments
that
are
part
of
the
other
necessary
expenses,
these
are
on
page
25-a
of
the
red
brief
that
counsel
on
our
side
mentioned.
these
are
other
necessary
expenses
that
are
actual
debt
payments
and
the
local
and
national
standards
are
expense
amounts.
we
don't
think
that
congress
defined
those
to
be
debt
payments.
so
the
function
of
the
payments
for
debts
language,
we
agree
with
respondent's
counsel
would
be
twofold.
first,
it
would
excise
the
other
necessary
expenses
that
actually
are
debt
payments,
which
makes
complete
sense.
one
of
them
is
an
unsecured
debt
payment,
and
you
wouldn't
want
to
consider
that
one
of
your
expenses
because
the
whole
point
of
the
calculation
is
to
figure
out
how
much
money
you
have
left
to
pay
unsecured
debt.
and
then
the
other
function
that
it
serves
is
in
romanette
iii
because
you
were
getting
secured
debt
payments
there
to
not
double-count
them
in
romanette
ii.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
we
say
that
those
are
expense
amounts
that
are
specified,
they're
not
payments
for
debts.
i
should
note,
because
justice
kennedy
asked
this
question,
that
this
was
not
something
that
was
relied
upon
by
the
courts
below.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
definitive
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
goes
through
in
detail
what
that
provision
is
designed
to
do.
so
i
would
urge
this
court
that
it
need
not
resolve
it
in
this
case
and
instead
do
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
which
is
to
say
that
just
looking
at
the
plain
text,
the
word
applicable
means
not
everybody
can
get
these
amounts
in
the
national
and
local
standards
and
it
needs
to
be
someone
who
actually
has
those
payment
amounts.
the
whole
point
of
this
part
of
this
statute
is
to
figure
out
what
money
is
available
to
pay
unsecured
creditors
and
it's
payments
that
need
to
be
made
for
expenses
that
matter,
it's
not
whether
the
individual
debtor
has
a
car.
i
also
note
just
because
it
came
up
earlier
and
is
a
very
important
point,
that
to
the
extent
that
the
court
only
wants
to
look
at
the
tables
to
figure
out
what
are
ownership
costs,
are
they
loan
and
lease
payments.
just
looking
at
the
title
of
the
table,
ownership
costs,
you
need
to
have
costs.
looking
at
the
fact
that
there
are
two
different
ones,
there
is
ownership
costs
as
opposed
to
operating
costs,
makes
clear
that
some
of
the
things
that
petitioner
suggests
might
be
ownership
costs
are,
in
fact,
operating
costs.
