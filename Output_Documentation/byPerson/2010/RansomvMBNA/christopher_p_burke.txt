mr.
christopher
p.
burke
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
2005
when
congress
passed
the
bankruptcy
act,
it
made
a
policy
decision
to
limit
judicial
discretion
on
a
case-by-case
basis
in
the
area
of
reasonable
and
necessary
expenses.
it
did
so
by
creating
a
formula
that
entails
an
aggregate
set
amount
of
expenses
for
an
individual.
now,
congress
could
have
created
this
from
scratch.
it
could
have
used
an
arbitrary
figure.
but
instead,
there
are
figures
that
the
irs
already
had,
based
on
census
bureau
statistics,
that
said
nationwide,
in
a
certain
area,
an
individual
would
spend
this
much
a
month
on
average.
in
the
case
of
mr.
ransom,
that's
approximately
2500
a
month.
forgetting
about
how
it's
divided
up,
if
i
had
100
people
come
in
and
answer
the
following
five
questions
the
same
way
mr.
ransom
did,
and
that's
age,
location,
household
size,
gross
income,
and
if
you
have
a
vehicle,
how
many,
they
would
all
get
$2,500
standard
aggregate
deduction,
which
works
out
to
$150,000
over
a
five-year
period.
now,
the
crux
of
this
is
whether
or
not
courts
are
allowed
to
dig
in
and
cut
out
pieces
of
the
standard
aggregate
amount.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
yes.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
there
was
a
collection
financial
analysis
that
was
in
place,
and
it
was
noted
in
1998
as
a
prior
version
of
the
bill
that
ultimately
wasn't
passed.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
i
would
disagree
with
that.
i
would
say
--
well,
it
would
--
it
would
explain
what
the
irs
means,
but
that's
where
i
would
end
it,
because
the
irs
standards
are
used
to
collect
taxes.
they
are
discretionary.
they--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--standards.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
it
didn't
go
beyond
that.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
for
the
irs
to
use
in
collecting
taxes.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
correct,
not
their
methodology
or
interpretation.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
yes.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
because
we
have
to
look
at
it
as
a
standard
aggregate.
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
--
okay,
the
bankruptcy
code
doesn't
define
ownership
costs.
and
ownership
costs
could
be
the
replacement
value.
it
could
be
buying
a
new
vehicle.
it
could
be
the
costs
associated
with
making
payments
on
a
vehicle.
what
that
--
that
average
number
is,
in
this
case,
$471,
is
a
nationwide
figure
that
somebody
would
spend
on
average
in
a
month.
it
doesn't
mean
that
any
one
individual
spends
that
amount.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
that's
their
position,
or
even
$1.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
again,
i
would
perhaps--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--the
cost
has
never
been
incurred.
that's
the
point.
and--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--in
the
situation
where
there
is
a
dollar,
of
course,
an
amendment
can
be
made.
but
the
--
the
dollar
doesn't
show
up
in
the
means
test.
the
means
test
is
the
aggregate--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--that's
what
the
lower
court
said.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
under
the
tax
law
you
get
a
standard
deduction.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
no
different
than
here.
nobody
goes
behind
the
scenes
and
says,
hey,
what
is
that
standard
deduction?
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
no,
that
is
not
what
i
think
is
the
law.
what
i'm
saying
is
congress
has
given,
in
this
case,
an
individual
like
jason
ransom
$150,000
over
five
years
to
spend.
they
are
not
saying
whether
he
actually
spends
it
in
any
one
category.
for
instance,
the
car
ownership
might
equate
to
$28,000
over
5
years.
rent
might
be
1,000.
that's
60,000
over
5
years.
congress
did
not
say,
go
back
and
make
sure
mr.
ransom
is
spending
every
dollar.
these
are
averages
across
the
nation.
and
when
it
comes
to
a
car
ownership
expense,
we
are
not
saying
spend
$471.
oh,
you
have
no
payment?
you
didn't
spend
anything
for
5
years?
no.
what
it's
saying
is
over
5
years
i
have
a
cost
associated
with
owning
that
vehicle,
whether
it's
a
loan
or
lease
payment,
whether
it's
replacing
the
vehicle,
whether
it's
major
repairs,
on
average,
across
the
country.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
correct.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
correct.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
because
the
standards
refer
to
the
numbers.
it's
a
chart.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
what
--
what--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--what
the
statute
says
is
the
applicable
--
you
shall
get,
mandatory,
the
applicable
amounts
specified
based
on
where
the
debtor
resides.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
in
the
national
local
standards.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
"the
debtor's
monthly
expenses
shall
be
the
debtor's
applicable
monthly
expense
amount
specified
under
the
national
local
standards.
"
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
specific
amount,
"applicable
modified
amount
specified".
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
correct,
based
on
where
a
debtor
resides.
now,
the
only
way
a
court
can
say
that
an
individual
has
to
have
a
debt
on
a
car
to
get
this
deduction
--
two
ways:
one--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--yes.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
yes,
because
they
get
the
cost
whether
they
owe
on
it
or
not.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
there's
a
different
definition.
ownership
doesn't
mean
--
it
can
mean
possession.
but--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--from
the--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--the
collection
financial
standards
say
you
get
the
lease
--
you
get
the
deduction
if
you
have
a
loan
or
a
lease
payment.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
i
don't.
i'm
not
sure
they
do
own
it.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
because
you
have
possession
of
it.
it's
based
on
having
the
item,
costs
associated
with
having
the
item,
whether
it's
paid
off
or
not.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
probably
under
ownership,
their
possession
is
some
type
of
an
ownership,
maybe
just
possessory.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
the
problem--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--no,
for
collection
of
taxes
there
is
not.
but
if
you're
going
to
use
--
start
digging
into
the
manual,
you
might
as
well
bring
it
all
in
to
707(b),
and,
as
we
discussed
earlier,
there
was
language
that
said
the
collection
financial
analysis
should
be
brought
in,
but
that
was
deleted
in
the
final
version.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
there
is
no
reason
to
limit
it.
if
you
are
going
to
--
the
text
doesn't
say
--
it
says
national
local
standards.
it
doesn't
discriminate
or
give
disparate
treatment
to
that
one
item.
if
you
are
going
to
give
it
to
one
item,
then
it
can
be
pulled
in,
and
it
should
be
--
the
same
treatment
should
be
given
to
all
items,
and
we
should
have
to
prove
some
type
of
a--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--to
collect
taxes,
that's
how
they
defined
it.
but
in
the
statute
it
says
you
get
"local
standard
amount
specified".
it
does
not
stretch
it
and
say
irs's
interpretation>
["].
that
language
was
taken
out.
and
if
we
were
to
use
the
irs
interpretation,
here's
the
whole
problem:
it's
discretionary.
it
goes
up
and
down.
it's
based
on
an
irs
revenue
agent.
it
--
let
me
give
you
a
separate
example--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--because
to
reach
that
you
have
to
go
into
the
internal
revenue
manual.
it's
not
in
the
statute
that
says
you
have
to
owe
on
it
to
get
it.
and
if
you
go
into
the
internal
revenue
manual
--
let's
look
at
operating
expenses.
what
it
says,
in
collecting
taxes,
and
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
83
through
88.
but
what
it
says
when
it
comes
to
local
national
and
other
expenses,
an
internal
revenue
agent
has
discretion.
you
only
get
these
expenses
--
this
is
the
overall
idea
--
if
they
produce
income
or
if
it's
for
health
and
welfare.
so
when
we
look
at
the
joint
appendix
page
88,
section
(b),
under
the
local
standard
transportation
expenses,
when
it
talks
about
operating
costs,
which
is
something
you
just
mentioned,
it
says
you
only
get
transportation
expenses
that
are
used
to
produce
income
for
the
health
and
welfare
of
an
individual
and
their
family.
plus,
the
fact
that
you
own
a
car,
the
irs
under
its
discretion
can
take
away
the
operating
costs
if
it's
on
four
cinder
blocks
in
your
backyard.
you
are
not
incurring
fuel
costs,
mileage
costs,
you
are
not
paying
probably
registration
or
any
of
those
other
operating
costs.
the
irs
agent
under
their
manual
can
take
away
that
expense.
so
why
stop
and
say,
well,
we're
just
going
to
look
at
the
ownership
costs,
and
all
they're
saying
here
is
if
you
owe
on
it
you
get
it,
if
you
don't
owe
you
don't
get
it.
let's
not
look
at
anything
else
in
the
internal
revenue
manual,
which
is
a
39
part,
500
page
document
that
in
some
ways
is
almost
incomprehensible,
and--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--if
the
court
understands
my
view
that
congress
gave--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--i'm
saying
you
get
all
the
deductions,
whether
you
owe
on
it
or
not.
is
there
a
specific
one
besides
the
car
ownership
that
says
you
have
to
owe
on
it?
no.
but
my
point
is--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--there
is
about
60
published
cases.
they
are
split
almost
50-50,
actually
more--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--this
is
one
line
that
they
have
looked
at
in
the
cases.
basically--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--yes,
they're
split
about
50-50.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
there's
two
published
cases
i'm
aware
of
and
both
allowed
it.
one,
somebody
had
military
housing;
one,
the
house
was
paid
off.
both
courts
said
you
get
it
under
the
local
standards.
but
the
irs
manual
would
not
give
that
to
you,
because
under
the
local
standards
the
irs
manual
says
you
get
the
specific
amount
or
your
actual
payment,
whatever
is
less.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
i
apologize
for
not
understanding
it.
no,
every
other
expense
deduction
that
i
have
seen
besides
the
car
ownership,
somebody
gets
it.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
correct.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
correct.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
right.
or
if
he
lives
at
home
and
mom
cooks
for
him.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
yes.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
no.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
it's
by
reason
of
the
bankruptcy
code
that
refers
to
the
standards
and
the
standards
specifically
say,
you
have
one
car,
no
cars
and
you
get
a
public
transportation,
or
two
cars;
pick
the
one.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
it's
in
the
chart.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
based
on
a
strict
reading
of
the
code,
you
get
it.
now,
would
the
irs
allow
it?
again,
that's
a
discretionary
standard,
but
any
time
you
have
an
objective
test
there's
going
to
be
line-drawing
and
perceived
unfairness
on
the
outskirts.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
it
can
addressed
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
that's
the
beauty
of
the
statute.
we
don't
need
to
go
into
the
internal
revenue
manual.
we
just
need
their
tables,
because
there
is
a
provision,
1325(a)(3),
that
deals
with
good
faith.
so
it
appears
somebody
is
not
acting
in
good
faith,
then--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--because--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--the
means
test
is
a
form,
and
if
you
look
at
the
form
--
the
means
test
is
a
form.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
if
you
look
at
the
form,
it
just
says--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--that's
it.
there's
no
definition
in
the
form.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
not
the
--
the
irs
does.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
not
the
statute
and
not
the
b-22
form
that
is
filled
out
by
debtors.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
we
don't
have
to.
congress
gave
standard
amounts
for--
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
--because
you
can
take
it
as
a
bunch
of
variables.
it's
not
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
so
it
could
be
replacement
costs,
it
could
be
major
repairs.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
yes.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
no,
we
don't.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
are
you
saying
in
707(b)?
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
my
answer
would
still
be
the
same
because
that's
not
a
congressional
formula.
that's
a
form
that
comes
off
the
department
of
justice
website
which
administers
the
u.s.
trustee's
program
and
that's
their
litigation
position.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
no.
i
would
say
an
individual
who
owns
a
car,
whether
they
owe
or
not,
gets
the
deduction
because
it's
part
of
this
aggregate
standard.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
correct.
it's
not
a
breakdown
on
what
any
one
individual
has.
it's
an
aggregate.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
thank
you,
i
will.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
thank
you.
the
means
test
knows
when
to
say
actual
when
it
wants
to
say
actual.
it
didn't
say
actual
in
this
case,
it
said
applicable.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
correct.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
correct.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
this
is
exactly
why
our
view
of
the
law
works.
the
means
test
is
a
minimum
amount.
it's
a
bottom
line
quick
figure
based
on
standard
deductions.
it
was
$200
based
on
our
calculation
if
he's
given
his
deduction
based
on
age,
location,
et
cetera.
we
then
go
back
to
i
and
j,
and
j,
which
is
on
page
44
of
the
joint
appendix,
is
his
current
expenses.
and
if
we
look
at
line
13-a,
there
is
no
vehicle
payment.
he
is
not
taking
$471.
he
took
his
income
and
expense,
the
bottom
line
was
500,
he
knew
he
had
to
pay
at
least
200,
he
is
willing
to
pay
the
500.
he
is
not
getting
a
$471
deduction
because
there
is
no
car
payment
on
his
schedule
j.
and
if
we
look
at
the
formula
that
way,
the
means
test
is
a
general
form
to
give
standard
deductions,
to
give
us
a
quick
bottom
line,
and
the
debtor
is
either
going
to
pay
that
amount
or
more
based
on
his
income
and
expense,
and
he
would
pay
more
if
he
really
didn't
have
that
expense.
so
if
he
didn't
have
a
rent
expense
of
$1,000
a
month
it
would
show
up
on
schedule
j
that
he
didn't
have
1,000,
so
his
payment
would
go
to
$1,500
a
month.
that's
the
good
faith
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
an
amount
of
at
least
$200.
it
would
be
hard
to
confirm
a
case
if
he
doesn't
pay
somewhere
in
that
range.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
it's
the
only
way
for
the
form
and
the
law
to
work.
the
means
test
is
a
bottom
line
number.
if
you
don't
have
one
of
those
expenses,
it
shows
up
on
schedule
j
and
it
gives
you
a
number.
if
it's
higher,
we
think
you
should
probably
pay
it
or
in
that
range.
if
it's
lower,
congress
isn't
saying
you
get
away
with
it,
it
says
you
get
out
of
chapter
13
if
you
are
not
going
to
pay
this
amount.
so
the
formula
is
just
to
come
up
with
a
bottom
line.
nobody
is
shielding
anything,
it's
all
black
and
white
on
his
current
expenses.
if
he
doesn't
have
it,
he
is
not
getting
it.
mr.

burke
at
the
time
the
debtor
files,
those
numbers
are
frozen.
mr.
christopher
p.
burke
the
numbers,
but
not
the
structure.
they
can
do
anything
they
want
when
they
are
collecting
taxes,
but
the
numbers
--
and
i
think
the
numbers
change
on
an
annual
basis.
