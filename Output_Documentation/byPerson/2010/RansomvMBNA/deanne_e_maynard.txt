ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
bankruptcy
code
precludes
an
above-median
income
debtor
like
petitioner
from
shielding
from
his
creditors
$471
a
month
for
a
car
payment
that
he
does
not
have.
a
debtor
with--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
statute
allows
a
debtor
to
take
an
applicable
monthly
expense
amount.
so
if
the
debtor
truly
has
no
food
costs,
then
the
food
standard
would
be
not
applicable
to
the
debtor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
i
think
with
respect,
i
think
the
cases
we
were
talking
about
were
housing.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
right.
so
housing
and
car
costs
are
part
of
the
local
standards.
food,
clothing,
house
cleaning
supplies,
those
are
part
of
the
national
standards.
the
--
in
our
view,
the
text
that
goes
along
with,
accompanies
the
tables,
which
is
not
the
internal
revenue
manual,
it's
just
the
pages
reprinted
at
1-a
to
3-a
of
our
brief,
the
collection
financial
standards,
the
prefatory
explanation
for
what
the
tables
mean.
in
our
view,
that
goes
along
and
is
incorporated
into
the
national
local
standards.
the
national
standards,
justice
sotomayor,
are
allowed.
as
long
as
you
have
under
the
calculations
as
explained
in
the
standards,
under
the
national
standards,
a
debtor
would
receive
the
allowance
in
the
table
as
long
as
they
have
any
such
expense,
so
regardless
of
amount.
however,
if
they
have
no
such
expense,
then
they
are
taken
out
by
the
statutory
language
in
the
means
test,
which
says
that
the
standard
must
be
applicable
to
the
debtor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if
they
are--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
if
over
the
60-month
period
looking
forward
you
know
that
you're
going
to
--
you've
already
paid
up
for
your
food
for
the
next
60
months
and
you
are
not
going
to
incur
any
additional
food
expenses,
no,
then
in
that
situation
the
standard
would
be
inapplicable
to
you.
you
would
be
having
now
--
in
that
hypothetical--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--under
the
standard.
that's
the
way
the
standards
operate,
your
honor.
i
haven't
seen
any
cases
litigated--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
for
this
reason,
which
is
that
the
national
standards
are
food,
clothing,
house
cleaning
supplies,
things
that
you
expect
every
debtor
to
have.
you
don't
see
much
litigation
about
those
expenses.
the
local
standards,
however,
operate
differently.
in
our
view
--
and
our
view's
different
from
the
government's,
justice
scalia.
in
our
view,
under
the
local
standards
and
the
way
that
they
apply
as
explained
in
the
collection
financial
standards,
is
that
the
debtor
is
allowed
their
actual
expense
for
the
local
standard
or
the
amount
in
the
table,
whichever
is
less.
so
in
the
hypothetical--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--in
our--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
read
that
text,
your
honor
--
again,
the
court
doesn't
need
to
decide
this
maximum
cap
issue
to
decide
this
case,
because
the
petitioner
has
no
expense
whatsoever
and
so
it's
not
applicable
to
him.
but
in
our
view,
justice
sotomayor
--
in
our
view
you
get
it
from
the
language
of
the
statute
that
says
"the
debtor's
applicable
monthly
expense
amount
specified
under
the
national
standards
and
local
standards.
"
and
the
way
that
we
understand
the
national
and
local
standards
to
work
is,
if
you
look
at
page
--
it's
explained
on
page
1a
of
the
petition
to
our
brief,
the
red
brief.
maximum
allowance
--
it's
the
third
paragraph
down:
"maximum
allowances
for
housing
and
utilities
and
transportation,
known
as
the
local
standards,
vary
by
location.
"
"unlike
the
national
standards,
the
taxpayer
is
allowed
the
amount
actually
spent
or
the
standard,
whichever
is
less.
"
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
how
i
understand
the
text.
the
text
provides--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes,
you
would,
your
honor,
because
what
the
--
what
the
statute's
purpose
here
is
--
i
mean,
i
think
it's
helpful
to
step
back.
chapter
13
sends
one
to
chapter
7's
means
test
for
the
purpose
of
calculating
the
amounts
reasonably
necessary
for
the
maintenance
and
support
of
the
debtor.
and
congress
chose
to
import
the
--
the
methodology
of
the
national
standards
and
local
standards
as
a
way
both
to
set
the
categories
of
expenses
that
debtors
could
receive
payment
for,
and,
with
the
case
of
the
national
and
local
standards,
to
set
the
amounts.
they
were
worried
about
capping
upper
discretion
because
congress,
it's
quite
clear
from
the
text
and
the
legislative
history,
was
concerned
about
above-medium-income
debtors
taking
luxurious
expense
amounts.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor,
because
the
amount
under
the
national
standards
as
the
national
standards
operate
is
the
--
is
an
allowance,
not
an
actual,
and
the
amount
under
the
local
standards
as
they
operate
is
the
amount
actually
spent
or
the
amount
in
the
table,
whichever
is
less.
again--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--money
is
fungible,
your
honor,
so
to
the
extent
the
debtor
has
incurred
expenses
before
going
into
bankruptcy
instead
of,
as
here,
paying
off
this
more
than
$85,000
in
credit
card
debt--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--he
used
his
money,
perhaps,
to
purchase
his
car
outright,
instead
of
to
pay
down
his
credit
card
debt,
and
so
he
has
a
salary
of
$50,000,
and
he
has
a
credit
card
debt
of
$85,000,
and
he
owns
a
2-year
car
--
2-year-old
car
outright.
he
should
not
be
able
to
deduct,
as
a
measure
of
his
reasonably
necessary
expenses
for
his
maintenance
and
support
over
the
next
50
months,
$28,000
that
he
doesn't
need
for
a
car
payment
that
he
doesn't
make.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
the
miscellaneous,
all
those
numbers
are
capped,
and
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
congress
thought
all
those
numbers
would
actually
effectively
act
as
caps.
in
other
words,
to
the
extent
there
was
debate
in
the
congress,
congress
was
concerned
that
these
numbers
were
actually
too
low,
not
that
they
were
going
to
give
anybody
a
windfall.
but
to
the
extent--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes,
your
honor,
and
in
the
national
standard,
which
all
the
items
you
just
list
are
national
standards,
under
the
national
standards
you
don't
do
the
actuals.
on
page
1a
it
explains:
"allowances
for
food,
clothing
and
other
items,
known
as
the
national
standards,
apply
nationwide
except
for
alaska
and
hawaii.
"
"taxpayers
are
allowed
the
total
national
standards
amount
for
their
family
size
and
income
level
without
questioning
amounts
actually
spent.
"
for
--
yes,
for
those
hard-to-calculate
items,
you
do
--
our
position
is
you
do
get
the
amounts
in
the
chart.
for
local
standards,
the
local
standards,
however,
which
include
home,
mortgage,
lease
expenses,
utilities
and
transportation,
which
include
both
ownership
costs
and
operating
costs,
you
get
the
actual
or
whichever
is
less.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
not
in
our
view,
your
honor,
because
in
our
view
the
chart
is
--
is
ambiguous
about
what
the
numbers
stand
for.
and
so
in
the
national
standards,
the
text,
the
prefatory
text,
explains
that
the
amount
is
an
allowance
if
you
have
the
expense.
in
the
local
standards
the
prefatory
text
explains
that
the
amount
operates
as
a
cap.
but
the
important
point
for
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
you
don't
have
to
decide
anything
about
the
national
standards
because
petitioner
is
left
at
the
statutory
door.
he
has
no
applicable
monthly
expense
amount
for
operating--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--if
the
debtor
owns
the
car
outright
at
the
time
they
file
for
bankruptcy,
they
would
not
get
the
deduction.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
they
would
not
get
a
deduction
under
this
calculation.
however,
under
this
court's
decision
in
lanning,
when
one
goes
to
project
the
disposable
income
it's
conceivable
that
the
debtor
could
prove
that
it's
known
or
virtually
certain
that
they
will
need
a
new
car
and
that
that
could
be
accounted
for.
but
also
the
bankruptcy
code
in
1329
allows
for
modification
of
a
plan,
and
so
when
the
time
arises
that
their
car
conks
out
and
they
need
a
new
car
they
can
move
to
modify
their
plan.
i
think--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
they
make
that
statement
in
their
reply
brief,
your
honor,
but
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
they
mean
by
that,
because
in
chapter
7
this
test
is
being
used
for
a
very
different
purpose.
it's
the
gateway;
it's
a
presumptive
test
for
abuse.
and
so
again,
our
reading
makes
perfect
sense
in
that
context
because
what
you
want
to
know
is
does
this
debtor
actually
have
moneys
it
can
prepay
its
creditors.
should
it
be--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
was
--
i
actually
haven't
answered
the
question.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
so
in
chapter
7,
you
want
to
--
if
you
decide
it's
presumptively
--
not
presumptively
abusive,
and
you
stay
in
chapter
7
and
chapter
7
is
a
liquidation.
there
is
no
ongoing
plan.
so
i
--
all
of
your
nonexempt
assets
are
liquidated,
your
creditors
are
paid
off,
and
then
you
are
discharged.
if
3
years
from
now
your
car
conks
out,
you're
just
like
you
and
me;
you
are
not
in
bankruptcy,
you
just
--
you
try
to
make
do.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
say,
justice
breyer,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
this
was
meant
to
be
an
overall
budget
for
above-median
income
debtors.
this
was
about
capping
upper
discretion
and
limiting
the
expenses
available
as
reasonably
necessary
expenses
for
above-median
income
debtors.
and
i
think
that
point
is
made
perfectly
clear
by
the
fact
that
you
can
compare
it
to
what
happens
now
to
a
below-median
income
debtor.
a
below-median
income
debtor
in
the
same
situation
as
petitioner,
who
owns
his
car
outright,
would
be
allowed
no
amount
as
an
expense
for
his
vehicle,
because
he
doesn't
have
an
actual
expense
that's
reasonably
necessary.
and
i
think
that
the
2005
congress
would
think
it
was
a
senseless
result,
as
they
argue
here,
that
petitioner
gets
$471,
above-median
income
debtor,
the
very
class
of
debtors
with
whom
congress
was
concerned
in
the
2005
amendment,
to
shield
from
his
creditors
over
the
life
of
the
plan
when
he
has
no
comparable
expense.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that
sentence
is
somewhat
of
a
conundrum,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
the
court
doesn't
need
to
decide
the
meaning
here,
because
whatever
it
does,
it
doesn't
get
the
petitioner
within
the
romanette
ii
calculation,
because
he
has
no
payment.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
my
understanding
of
that
provision
is
that
it
serves
two
purposes.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
serves
two
purposes.
the
first
is
that
it
makes
clear
--
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
we
have
the
other
necessary
expenses
from
the
irm.
and
on
--
near
the
back,
page
25a,
two
of
the
categories
of
other
necessary
expenses
are
secured
or
legally
perfected
debts
and
unsecured
debts.
so
i
think
the
--
the
otherwise
--
the
"notwithstanding"
sentence
makes
clear
that
romanette
ii
should
not
capture
those
other
unsecured
debts
and
secured
debts
that
is
the
whole
purpose
of
this
calculation,
to
figure
out
how
much
money
you
have
to
pay
those
things.
the
second
purpose
the
sentence
serves
is
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
double-counting,
because
romanette
iii,
the
very
next
provision
in
the
means
test,
allows
the
debtor
to
claim
monthly
payments
for
secured
debts.
now,
many
car
loans
are
probably
secured
debts
and
in
our
view
if
you
actually
have
a
car
loan
--
now,
remember
again,
he
neither
has
a
car
loan,
nor
a
car
lease
payment,
nor
any
kind
of
ownership
payment.
but
if
--
if
one
actually
did
have
a
car
loan
that
was
secured
by
the
car,
which
i
think
is
the
vast
majority
of
car
loans,
in
our
view
the
debtor
expenses
nothing
for
that
under
romanette
ii,
and
only
the
actual
amount
of
that
debt
under
romanette
iii.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
whichever
is
less.
i
think
that
--
that
is
my
understanding
of
how
the
local
standards
work,
your
honor.
i
think,
then,
as
a
practical
matter,
that
really
will
end
up
only
applying
to
car
leases
with
respect
to
transportation
ownership
costs,
because
i
think
that
the
notwithstanding
sentence
removes
secured
car
loans
from
romanette
ii
and
has
been
calculated
under
romanette
iii,
where
there
is
no
comparable
cap.
but
the
point
at
issue
in
this
case
doesn't
involve
the
interaction
between
romanette
ii
and
romanette
iii,
because
no
matter
how
those
two
things
interact,
when
the
debtor
has
no
payment
whatsoever,
he
ought
not
to
be
able
to
claim
any
car
ownership
costs,
because
what
we
are
frying
to
figure
out
is:
what
amount
does
he
reasonably
need
for
his
maintenance
and
support?
and
this
question
is
a
very
important
question.
this
scenario
happens
a
lot.
in
the
2007
study
that
u.s.
trustees
did
at
congress's
request
to
--
which
petitioner
cites
in
his
reply
brief,
the
average
overpayment
of
a
debtor
in
claiming
this
transportation
ownership
expense
was
$335,
which
is
a
lot
when
you
are
talking
about
the
standard
in
the
tarp
being
471.
there
are
many
debtors
who
are
getting
this
expense
either
above
their
amount
or
when
they
have
no
such
expense
at
all,
and
so
even
if
the
court
doesn't
resolve
these
other
issues
that
are
implicated
by
this
case,
the
decision
here
is
a
simple
one,
which
is:
this
debtor
has
no
applicable
monthly
expense
amount
for
transportation
ownership
costs,
and
he
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
expense
any
amount
for
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
the
respondent
requests
that
the
court
would
affirm
the
judgment
below.
