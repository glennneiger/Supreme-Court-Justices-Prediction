justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
burke,
isn't
it
the
--
isn't
it
the
case
that,
even
on
the
other
side's
interpretation
of
it,
it
doesn't
come
down
to
actual
costs
anyway?
isn't
it
the
case,
or
do
i
misunderstand
it,
that
so
long
as
there
is
one
payment,
you
get
the
entire
deduction?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
one
payment
of
$1,
you
get
the
entire
deduction.
so
to
argue
this
case
as
though
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
actually
expend
the
money
that
you
are
getting
the
credit
for
is
simply
--
is
simply
false.
you
don't
do
that
under
either
side's
interpretation,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
trying
to
help
you,
mr.
burke.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
--
what
happens
under
the
tax
law?
do
they
make
an
adjustment
under
the
tax
law
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
standard--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
so
that
they
--
what
is
suggested
is
that
you
look
at
it
and
apply
the
irs's
approach
as
to
whether
you
get
into
the
chart,
but
then
you
don't
use
the
irs's
approach
when
the
trustee
takes
you
out
of
the
chart.
is
that
what
you
think
is
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
language
we
are
dealing
with,
mr.
burke?
do
you
want
to
quote
the
language
to
us?
nobody's
quoted
the
language.
what
does
it
say
is
applicable?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
the
--
the
applicable
amounts
specified
where?
justice
antonin
scalia
read
the
text
of
the
statute,
would
you,
please,
for
me?
i
couldn't
even
get
it
from
your
brief.
you
had
to
refer
me
back
to
the
petition.
why
isn't
an
appendix
to
your
brief
or
printed
in
the
beginning
of
your
brief,
instead
of
kicking
me
back
to
dig
out
your
petition.
justice
antonin
scalia
"amount
specified
under"
the
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
"applicable
amount
specified",
not
the
"amount
specified
if
applicable".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
are
saying.
he
asked
are
they
split
50-50
on
the
point
that
is
before
us
here,
yes
or
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
once
again,
mr.
burke,
this
is
--
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
point
this
out.
this
is
not
the
difference
between
your
position
and
the
position
of
the
other
side.
you
get
the
deduction
for
the
other
side
as
well,
whether
or
not
you
are
making
the
payment.
now,
maybe
it
can
be
adjusted
by
the
trustee,
but
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
so
long
as
you
make
one
payment
of
one
dollar,
under
their
theory
you
are
entitled
to
claim
the
deduction;
isn't
that
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
--
is
that
by
reason
of
the
internal
revenue
service--
justice
antonin
scalia
--manual
or
is
it
by
reason
of
the
bankruptcy
code
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
in
the
chart--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
you
claim
--
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
a
problem
distinctive
to
your
case?
doesn't
the
other
side
have
the
same
problem
with
ownership?
don't
they
acknowledge
that
even
if
you
are
leasing
the
car
you
get
the
deduction?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
this
is
distinctive
to
your
case.
it's
a
problem
both
sides
face.
and
we
don't
avoid
it
by
coming
out
against
you,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
your
position
is
more
logical
than
the
position
that
you
read
in
some
of
the
instructions
applicable
to
the
--
to
the
chart
that's
referred
to
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
but
not
others.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
are
going
to
read
in
the
requirement
that
have
to
have
made
a
lease
payment,
you
should
also
read
in
the
requirement
that
you
are
referring
to
now,
which
would
mean
your
deduction
is
limited
by
the
--
by
the
amount
of
your
lease
payment.
i
don't
see
why
--
is
there
any
reason
why
one
would
read
in
the
other
one
and
not
read
in
yours?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
aren't
--
why
isn't
one
of
the
criteria
the
provision
that
says
maximum
allowances
for
housing
and
utilities
and
transportation,
known
as
the
local
standards,
vary
by
location
and
unlike
the
national
standards,
the
taxpayer
is
allowed
the
amount
actually
spent
or
the
standard,
whichever
is
less?
why
doesn't
that
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
applicable.
it's
not
applicable
if,
in
fact,
you
haven't
spent
that
much.
just
as
you
claim
it's
not
applicable
if
you
have
no
payment
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
have
to
go
to
1,500
a
month
or
he,
out
of
the
goodness
of
his
heart,
would
decide
to
pay
that
amount?
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
so
why
would
we
assume,
i
don't
know
--
your
client
is
an
extraordinarily
generous
fellow.
i
don't
think
most
people
when
they
go
through
bankruptcy
are
going
to
cough
up
any
more
than
they
have
to.
