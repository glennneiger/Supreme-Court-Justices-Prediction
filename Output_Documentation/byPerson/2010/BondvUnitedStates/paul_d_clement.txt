mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
standing
of
petitioner
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
statute
under
which
her
liberty
is
being
deprived
should
not
be
open
to
serious
question.
she
clearly
satisfies
this
court's
modern
tripartite
test
for
standing.
indeed,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
an
injury
more
particularized
or
concrete
than
six
years
in
federal
prison,
and
the
liberty
interest
she
seeks
to
vindicate
is
her
own,
not
some
third
party's.
in
many
ways,
i
think
"standing"
is
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
here.
petitioner
is
not
a
plaintiff
who
seeks
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court.
she
is
a
defendant
who
has
been
hailed
into
court
by
a
federal
prosecutor.
there
is
no
logical
reason
she
should
not
be
able
to
mount
a
constitutional
attack
on
the
statute
that
is
the
basis
for
the
prosecution.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
it
was
in
the
habeas
context,
but
the
spencer
decision
does
talk
about
how,
when
you
have
a
criminal
defendant
or
somebody
who
is
serving
a
sentence,
their
standing
to
challenge
the
conviction
is
essentially
one
of
the
easiest
standing
cases
you
can
imagine.
and
i
think
in
a
sense,
the
same
principles
would
apply
here.
but
as
i
said,
i
think
standing
is
normally
something
you
think
about
as
applying
to
the
plaintiff,
who
is
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
so
what's
really
at
issue
here
is
something
--
almost
more
of
a
bar
on
somebody's
ability
to
make
an
argument
that
would
vindicate
their
liberty,
and
i
see
no
reason
why,
in
logic,
that
should
be
the
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
essentially
didn't
apply
ordinary--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i'm
not
sure
you
would
call
it
normal
standing
principles,
your
honor.
there
are
certainly
arguments
you
could
make
that
you
--
would
have
no
business
having
anything
to
do
with
your
case.
there's
arguments
you
could
make
that
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
--
would
be
non-justiciable--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
guess
i
would
have
to
know
why
you
were
a
defendant
in
that
case
and
how
it
had
anything
to
do
with
the
price
of
tea
in
that
particular
case.
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
i
don't
think
that
follows.
i
mean,
i
think
if
--
if
the
federal
executive
tried
to
imprison
you
based
on
your
religion,
you
could
take
issue
with
that
and
say
that's
an
establishment
clause
violation.
the
problem
in
your
recent
case,
the
hein
case,
is
the
only--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
if
they
said,
well,
we're
hereby
establishing
a
religion
and
you're
not
part
of
our
religion
and
we're
therefore
imprisoning
you,
i
would
think
you
could
bring
that
claim.
but
in
all
events,
bringing
it
back
to
the
case
before
you,
i
think
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
ordinary
principles
of
standing
wouldn't
give
my
client
every
ability
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
which
she's
being
held.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kagan,
principally
our
argument
here
is
an
enumerated
powers
argument.
my
problem,
though,
is
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
some
clearly
defined
set
of
tenth
amendment
claims
that
are
uniquely
only
tenth
amendment
claims
and
not
enumerated
power
claims.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think
so,
but
let
me
just
say
that
my
problem
is
--
take
the
printz
case.
the
printz
case
itself
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
it
was
an
enumerated
power
case.
in
answering
an
argument
in
the
dissent,
the
majority
opinion
says,
this
is
not
separate
from
enumerated
powers.
if
you--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
kagan,
but
i'd
hate
to
sort
of
bet
my
case
that
on
remand,
i'm
not
going
to
say
something
in
making
an
argument
that
the
government
or
somebody
else
thinks
is
too
much
of
a
commandeering
claim
and
too
much
--
not
enough
of
an
enumerated
power
claim.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
again,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
the
basis
of
our
claim.
but
just
to
give
you
a--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
you
could
certainly
do
that,
and
as
long
as
it
is
crystal
clear
that
there
will
be
no
obstacle
to
my
client
making
a
constitutional
attack
on
section
229
on
remand,
i
suppose
that's
fair
enough
for
my
client.
but
one
of
the
arguments
we've
preserved,
for
example,
is
the
argument
that
missouri
vs.
holland
is
not
a
blank
check
for
the
government,
that
it
requires
a
balancing
of
the
state's
interests
against
the
federal
interests.
and
if
on
remand,
i
wax
eloquent
about
the
state's
interest
in
criminal
prosecution
and
law
enforcement,
i
would
hate
for
a
trap
door
to
open
up
at
that
point
and
i
be
told
that,
wait,
wait,
that's
too
much
of
the
state's
interest
and
not
enough
of
your
own
interest.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy,
and
that's
the
fundamental
worry
i
have
here,
is
that
this
court's
cases
have
not
drawn
a
distinction
between
commandeering
claims
and
enumerated
powers
claims.
the
two
cases
the
government
points
to,
new
york
and
printz,
both
go
out
of
their
way
to
say
that
they
are
mirror
images
or,
in
fact,
enumerated
power
claims,
because
a
law
that
commandeers
is
not
necessary
and
proper.
and
i
do
also
think
that
a
part
of
the
problem
with
the
suggestion
that
somehow
tennessee
electric
should
be
reimagined
as
a
third
party
standing
claim
is
it
fundamentally
miscomprehends
for
whom
the
structural
provisions
of
the
constitution
are
there
for.
those
provisions
are
there
to
protect
the
liberty
of
citizens.
the
united
--
this
court
made
that
point
in
the
free
enterprise
fund
just
last
term.
there
was
a
case
where
it
wasn't
the
executive
complaining
about
the
infringement
on
executive
power.
the
executive
branch
ably
defended
the
statute
in
this
court.
it
was
a
disgruntled
accounting
firm
that
was
allowed
to
vindicate
the
separation
of
powers.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
it
would,
justice
alito.
my
point
is
not
that
there's
some
special
rule
for
the
tenth
amendment
that
plaintiffs
will
always
have
standing.
my
point
is
that
you
should
just
apply
the
normal
rules.
and
what
i
don't
think
is
sustainable
is
the
proposition
that
in
commandeering
claims
an
individual
never
has
standing.
i
mean,
imagine
a
federal
statute
that
purported
to
save
federal
money
by
commandeering
local
prosecutors
to
prosecute
federal
crimes.
well,
i
would
hope
that
a
defendant
in
that
kind
of
case
would
be
able
to
raise
a
commandeering
argument
as
a
defense.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
any
different
if
congress
tried
to
commandeer
the
comptroller
general
to
start
bringing
criminal
prosecutions.
in
that
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
--
i
don't
self-identify
as
having
made
a
commandeering
claim.
but
what
i
would
say
is
--
we're
not
asking
you
to
do
anything
special.
i
just
think
it's
the
government
that's
asking
you
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
reconceptualize
tennessee
electric
as
a
different
kind
of
case
and
preserve
it.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well
two
things,
justice
alito.
first,
this
is
a
technical
matter.
we
could
go
back
to
the
third
circuit
on
our
way
back
to
coming
here
and
we
would
still
have
standing
to
make
an
argument
that
it's
foreclosed
by
precedent.
but
i
think
it's
a
mistake
to
think
that
missouri
v.
holland
is
some
bright-line
rule
that
forever
answers
this
question.
as
i
read
missouri
v.
holland
and
as
we
clearly
argued
before
the
third
circuit,
it's
not
a
blank
check.
it's
really
is
more
of
a
balancing
test
that
looks
at
the
state's
interest
and
the
federal
interest
in
assessing
whether
or
not
the
statute
that
implements
the
treaty
is
necessary
and
proper.
and
i
think
this
case
compares
pretty
favorably
with
missouri
against
holland
because
there
the
state's
interests
was
very
weak
because
these
birds
were
just
flying
through
on
their
way
and
there
was
no
real
state
interest,
or
so
this
court
held,
whereas
in
this
case
the
state
has
a
real
legitimate
interest
in
law
enforcement.
i
also
think
we
ought
to
be
able
to
make--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it
does,
justice
alito.
i
think
it
would
matter
in
part
for
a
constitutional
avoidance
statutory
construction
argument,
which
i
think
also
ought
to
be
open
to
us.
i
sort
of
think
by
analogy
to
the
jones
case,
where
this
court
said
that
a
federal
statute
about
arson
doesn't
apply
when
a
cousin
throws
a
molotov
cocktail
at
a
residence.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
was
trying
to
respond
to
the
question
of
whether
we
would
be
foreclosed.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
we're
not
asking
you
to
do
more
than
do
standing.
but
i
do
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
we
don't
think
we
would
be
limited
to
just
losing
on
missouri
v.
holland
below
and
coming
back
up.
we
think
we
have
a
very
good
argument
about
missouri
v.
holland
as
applied.
we
also
think
that
there
is
sort
of
a
statutory
construction
argument.
and
this
isn't
sarin.
there
is
something
sort
of
odd
about
the
government's
theory
that
says
that
i
can
buy
a
chemical
weapon
at
[amazondotcom.]
that
strikes
me
as
odd,
and
that
seems
to
me
the
kind
of
thing
where
you
could
make
a
statutory
construction
to
say,
well,
maybe
sarin
or
maybe
actual
chemical
weapons,
that's
one
thing,
but
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
commonly
available
chemical,
to
say
without
any
jurisdictional
element
or
anything
like
that,
that
it's
a
federal
crime
seems
like
an
argument
we
at
least
ought
to
have
standing
to
make.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
could
i
say
two
things
about
that
sentence,
and
then
explain
what
i
really
think
you
should
say?
first
of
all,
the
first
thing
i
would
say
about
that
sentence
is
that
i
don't
think,
read
in
the
context
of
the
entire
opinion,
it
actually
means
that
the
court
is
trying
to
impose
a
special
disability
on
tenth
amendment
claims,
because
remember,
they
have
already
rejected
the
plaintiff's
basis
for
having
standing.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
it's
dictum
in
another
way.
but
what
i
think
it
stands
for
is
the
proposition
--
it
rejects
the
argument
that
if
you
don't
otherwise
have
standing
under
the
governing
standing
rule
of
the
day
that
you
somehow
have
a
license
to
bring
a
tenth
amendment
claim.
and
if
that's
what
it
stands,
well,
it
was
right
then
and
it
continues
to
be
right.
a
second
point
to
make
about
it
is
it
is
dictum,
and
if
you
read
the
sentence,
what
it
says
is
the
following:
it
makes
a
reference
to
what
it's
already
established
a
couple
of
paragraphs
earlier,
which
is
the
states
at
issue
here
have
passed
laws
to
accommodate
tva's
sale
of
power,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
if
this
were
not
so.
what
does
that
--
that
is
a
counterfactual
hypothetical.
it's
the
worst
kind
of
dictum.
it
says
if
this
were
not
so.
if
it
were
not
the
fact
that
the
states
had
already
taken
these
actions
to
affirmatively
accommodate
then
we
would
have
a
different
question
and
then
there
wouldn't
be
standing.
so
it
is
dictum
i
think
and
can
be
disregarded
as
such.
but
really
if
you
ask
me
what
you
should
do
with
it,
you
should
do
what
you
did
in
twombly,
with
some
language
in
an
opinion
that
had
continued
to
cause
trouble
in
the
50
years
since.
you
should
just
say
that's
no
longer
good
law
because
it's
not.
the
central
holding
of
tennessee
electric
was
overruled
40
years
ago
in
the
camp
case,
and
i
think
this
language
is
of
a
piece
from
that
legal
interest
test,
the
legal
wrong
test
of
standing,
and
i
think
this
court
should
make
clear
that
it
doesn't
apply
any
longer,
and
the
virtue
of
that
would
be
that
it
would
free
up
the
lower
courts
to
decide
these
tenth
amendment
standing
claims
based
on
an
application
of
normal
standing
principles,
because
that's
not
happening
in
the
lower
court
right
now.
in
the
lower
court
right
now
what
happens
is
somebody
comes
in
with
a
tenth
amendment
claim
of
whatever
stripe,
maybe
it's
a
commandeering
claim,
maybe
it's
not,
and
what
they're
confronted
with,
especially
if
it's
a
commandeering
claim,
is
a
quick
citation
of
tennessee
electric,
an
equally
quick
citation
of
shearson
which
says
only
this
court
can
overturn
its
decisions,
and
that's
it.
no
standing
analysis,
nothing
subtle
about
the
particular
claim.
and
that's
not
a
sustainable
situation.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
one
reason
not
to
carve
out
a
special
rule
for
commandeering
claims
is
that
not
all
commandeering
claims
are
created
equal.
mr.
dreeben
raises
the
commandeering
claim
that
has
been
litigated
in
the
context
of
sorna,
the
sex
offender
registration
act.
i
don't
know
the
details
of
that
enough
to
know
whether
that's
a
valid
commandeering
claim
or
not,
or
whether
there's
a
redressability
problem
in
that
particular
case.
but
i
can
certainly
imagine
a
commandeering
case,
a
federal
statute
that
purports
to
commandeer
local
prosecutors
to
prosecute
federal
crimes,
where
there
would
be
no
standing
obstacle;
and
the
problem
is
right
now
the
lower
courts
aren't
resolving
the
standing
issue
in
the
sorna
challenges
based
on
a
careful
analysis
of
article
iii
standing,
redressability
or
prudential
standing,
for
that
matter.
they're
resolving
those
challenges
with
a
simple
citation
to
tennessee
electric
and
let's
move
on,
and
that's
really
what
should
stop.
a
second
reason
that
you
should
not
try
to
carve
out
commandeering
cases
as
being
somehow
the
residuum
of
the
tennessee
electric
dictum
is
because
tennessee
electric
says
nothing
about
commandeering
cases.
it
just
talks
broadly
about
tenth
amendment
claims.
you
know,
we
can
disagree
or
agree;
it's
kind
of
hard
to
figure
out
what
the
nature
of
the
claim
was
in
tennessee
electric.
i
don't
think
it
was
really
much
different
from
the
claim
that
we're
raising
here,
which
is
in
tennessee
electric
they
said,
well,
if
the
federal
government
gets
to
regulate
power,
what's
left
of
state's
traditional
prerogative
to
regulate
the
price
for
power.
here
is
if
the
federal
government
can
go
in
and
prosecute
you
for
putting
vinegar
in
your
neighbor's
goldfish
bowl,
what's
left
of
local
law
enforcement.
i
think
they're
very
similar
arguments.
but
whatever
else
is
true,
i
just
don't
think
tennessee
electric
limited
itself
to
commandeering
claims
in
any
way
that
would
allow
you
to
say
that
mr.
dreeben
refers
to
the
enduring
force
of
tennessee
electric.
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
tennessee
electric
has
any
enduring
force.
the
central
holding
of
this
decision
was
overruled
in
camp.
the
further
you
go
in
the
decision
the
less
satisfying
it
is.
if
you
go
all
the
way
to
reading
the
georgia
power
case
cited
in
footnote
27
as
justice
breyer
has
done,
and
you
look
at
the
role
of
consent
of
the
states,
it
turns
out
in
the
district
court
opinion,
that's
in
the
merits
section
of
the
opinion.
the
court's
already
held
contrary,
actually,
to
the
holding
of
tennessee
electric
that
the
utility
companies
there
had
standing.
so
what
you
see
is,
you
know
what
happens
if
you
apply
the
legal
interest
test,
you
hopelessly
conflate
the
merits
and
the
standing
question.
that's
kind
of
happened
today
in
oral
argument.
that's
a
bad
approach.
the
court
was
right
to
get
rid
of
it
in
camp,
and
it
should
perfect
the
camp
decision
by
saying
this
sentence
no
longer
survives.
two
other
minor
points.
one
is
on
the
commerce
clause,
i
think
justice
alito
shows
why
the
government
was
right
never
to
make
that
argument
below,
but
i
do
think
it's
important
that
if
this
court
says
anything
about
the
commerce
clause
issue,
it
doesn't
somehow
reinject
it
in
the
case
in
a
way
that
would
not
allow
us
to
argue
that
it
has
been
clearly
waived
in
the
third
circuit.
the
government
gets
to
confess
air,
it
doesn't
get
to
confess,
oh,
actually,
we
have
a
better
argument
to
defend
the
statute
that
we've
never
raised
before.
plain
error
should
be
a
two-way
street,
and
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
sneak
the
commerce
clause
back
into
the
case
at
this
late
stage.
finally,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
separation
of
powers
case
and
the
federalism
case.
the
best
example
of
that
is
this
court's
free
enterprise
fund
case.
when
it
wants
a
case
to
cite
for
the
proposition
that
the
executive
branch
cannot
waive
or
acquiesce
in
a
separation
of
powers
violation,
because
the
separation
of
powers
is
there
to
protect
the
individual,
what
does
it
cite?
new
york
against
united
states.
please
reverse
the
decision
below.
