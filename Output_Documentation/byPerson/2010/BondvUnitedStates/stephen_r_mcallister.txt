mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
relevant
standing
doctrine
in
this
case
is
the
prudential
rule
against
third-party
standing.
no
one
disputes
here
that
the
petitioner
has
article
iii
standing.
one
of
the
difficulties
in
the
case
is
that
the
only
case
that
mentions
specifically
standing
in
this
context
is
the
tennessee
valley
authority
case
and
it
clearly
says
if
it
is
in
fact
a
tenth
amendment
claim,
unless
you
have
a
state
official
or
the
state,
there
is
no
standing.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
it's
potentially
harsh,
your
honor,
but
there
are
lower
court
cases
that
have
certainly
done
it.
there
is
some
circuit
cases
where
a
criminal
defendant
has
tried
to
make
a
tenth
amendment
claim
and
the
court
has
said
no.
she
still
has
several
other
claims
here.
we
all
agree,
i
think,
to
the
extent
you
could
really
characterize
her
claim
as
an
article
i
enumerated
powers
claim,
this
court
has
assumed
many
times
that
defendants
have
the
standing.
this
court
generally
has
not
discussed
it,
but
it
has
assumed
it,
and
so
there
are
cases
that
say
no
standing
for
a
criminal
defendant.
she
did
make
a
fifth
amendment
due
process
vagueness
challenge.
if
she
had
other
bill
of
rights
type
claims.
even
the
treaty
power
cases
like
reid
v.
covert
recognize
you
could
raise
that
kind
of
claim,
but
the
court's
cases
do
distinguish
between
tenth
amendment
and
other
claims.
and
a
lot
of
the
argument
here
is
about
what
is
on
the
tenth
amendment
side
of
the
line,
what
is
a
lack
of
power,
for
a
better
word,
whether
it's
--
there's
an
article
i,
power
doesn't
reach
it.
and
in
particular
i
would
point
to
the
heller
case,
which
petitioner
mentions
in
her
reply
brief,
but
frankly
is
off
by
one
page
in
the
citation
that
the
court
should
focus
on,
pages
579
to
'80.
the
court
says
"there
are
three
times
in
the
constitution
where
the
word.
"
the
people
"is
not
talking
about
individual
rights.
"
"and
the
three
examples
the
court
gives
are
the
preamble,
article
1,
section
2,
and
the
tenth
amendment.
"
"and
the
court
says
these
provisions
are
about
reservations
of
power,
not
rights.
"
"and
also
the
printz
and
the
new
york
v.
united
states
cases
say
there
is
something
substantive
about
the
tenth
amendment
that
is
a
limit
separate
and
apart
from
article,
section
8.
"
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
i
would
say
at
least
a
couple
things,
your
honor.
one
is,
the
usual
rule
of
prudential
third-party
standing
considers
the
alignment
or
lack
of
alignment
between
the
interests
of
the
third
party
making
the
claim
and
the
party
who
is
not
present
whose
claim
it
really
is.
and
in
this
case,
there's
really
no
argument
that
her
interests
align
with
those
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
the
commonwealth
in
fact
prosecuted
her
and
it
did
not
stop
her.
it
was
unsuccessful
as
a
deterrent.
and
later,
when
local
police
wouldn't
be
involved,
the
federal
government
got
involved.
and--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--no,
that's
my
point.
and
so
my
point
is
that
her
interests
are
directly
contrary
to
pennsylvania's
interests.
so
she's
not
stepping
in
saying:
i
share
the
interests
of
the
state;
therefore,
let
me
articulate
and
argue
the
interests
of
the
state.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
it's
standard
that
both
sovereigns
have
the
ability
often
to
prosecute
if
the
definitions
of
crimes
overlap,
and
there's
nothing
that
prevents
pennsylvania
from
prosecuting
her
again
here.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
in--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--because
the
lower
courts,
at
least,
in
their
defense,
understood
this
to
be
a
tenth
amendment
claim,
and
there
are
reasons
for
that.
now,
in
this
court
neither
the
petitioner
nor
the
government
really
wants
to
talk
about
that
or
argue
about
that.
instead,
they
talk
about
the
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
after
the
third
circuit
has
decided
the
case.
but
if
you
look
in
the
joint
appendix,
pages
26
to
32
is
the
supplemental
brief
that
her
lawyer
filed
when
the
third
circuit
said,
post-argument:
now,
wait
a
minute,
maybe
this
is
a
tenth
amendment
case
and
we
have
a
standing
issue.
the
government,
at
that
point,
said:
hey,
good
idea;
we
don't
think
she
does
have
standing.
and
she
did
not
come
back
and
answer:
i'm
not
making
a
tenth
amendment
claim.
her
answer
is:
i'm
making
a
tenth
amendment
claim,
but
i
have
standing
to
make
it.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
as
a
--
i
mean,
she's
arguing
a
lack
of
power.
so--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--well,
i
think,
again,
the
sentence
--
i
mean,
if
we're
talking
about
the
sentence
in
tva
barring
standing
in
tenth
amendment
claims--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--it
says
"in
this
case",
but
there's
no
suggestion
that
it
will
--
frankly,
it's
hard
for
us
to
even
tell
exactly
what
this
case
was
in
terms
of
the
facts.
it's
a
rather
confusing
case.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
for
that
particular
instance
--
and
that's
certainly
an
example
the
court
had
in
mind.
the
language
of
tva,
though,
is
in
no
way
limited
to
that
particular
instance.
it
just
says
here,
there's
--
if
this
is
a
tenth
amendment
claim,
there
is
no
standing.
and
that's
why,
i
think,
for
70
years
the
lower
courts
have
wrestled
with,
what
is
a
tenth
amendment
claim?
because
tva
is
there,
this
court
has
announced
it,
and
if
it
is
a
tenth
amendment
claim,
there
is
no
standing.
sort
of
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
question,
though,
in
terms
of
the
third-party
prudential
aspect
of
it,
again,
the
issue
is:
is
this
person
a
good
person
to
assert
someone
else's
interests?
yes,
she
has
article
iii
standing,
but
not
necessarily
to
make
every
constitutional
claim
one
might
think
of.
in
the
tenth
amendment
context,
those
claims
belong
to
the
states.
they
don't
create
individual
rights.
and
in
fact,
there's
good
reason
to
think
the
states
do
get
involved
when
they
perceive
actual
tenth
amendment
violations.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
that's--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--as
i
understand
her
complaint,
basically
her
argument
is
that
unless
this
statute
is
authorized
by
something
in
article
i,
section
8,
the
first
17
clauses,
there's
no
power
to
enact
it.
and
that's
why
this
case
is,
frankly,
not
clearly
governed
by
lopez
or
raich
or
morrison.
those
were
straight
commerce
power
cases
under
section
3.
this
is
a
treaty
power
case
under
article
ii,
and
she
only
wants
to
read
the
first
half
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
which
refers
to
all
the
foregoing
powers.
but
it
also
says
necessary
and
proper
for
all
other
powers.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
your
honor,
in
essence,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
will
be
a
merits
question,
but
from
a
standing
argument,
trying
to
define
what
is
a
tenth
amendment
claim
--
and
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
perhaps
not
successfully,
is
that
she's
not
saying
--
well,
she
is
sort
of
saying
the
article
i,
section
8
enumerated
powers
are
the
limits.
but
frankly,
they
can't
be
the
limits.
in
light
of
the
plain
language
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
and
missouri
v.
holland
and
90
years
of
this
court's
precedent
under
the
treaty
power,
those
powers
are
not
limits.
so
she's
asserting
they're
limits
and
saying,
i'm
really
making
an
article
i
claim,
but
that
simply
lets
her
always
have
standing,
because,
even
in
the
commandeering
cases,
the
plaintiff
can
say,
this
is
about
article
i,
this
is
not
about
the
tenth
amendment.
and
so
at
some
point
the
court
has
to
drill
down
and
characterize
what
the
nature
of
the
claim
actually
is.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--in
an
enumerated
powers
case,
yes.
the
problem
--
i
think
the
difficulty
with
this
case
is
it's
unusual
and
that
there
--
until
its
reply
brief
in
this
court,
the
government
had
not
relied
on
the
commerce
power.
in
fact,
the
government
had
said
throughout:
this
is
a
treaty
power
case,
treaty
power
case.
even
at
the
oral
argument
in
the
third
circuit,
the
judge
said,
couldn't
we
decide
this
on
the
basis
of
the
treaty
power?
wouldn't
--
or
the
commerce
power
--
would
not
that
be
the
easy
route?
and
the
government
lawyer
said,
no,
that
would
be
the
hard
route;
you
need
to
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
the
treaty
power.
so
i
agree
in
a
lopez
kind
of
case
that,
really,
that's
where
the
court
has
often
said
it's
just
mirror
image.
if
the
commerce
power
doesn't
go
that
far,
then
by
definition
it's
reserved
under
the
tenth
amendment.
but
here,
it's
a
treaty
power
case.
it's
not
an
article
i,
section
8--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--well,
i
would
disagree
somewhat,
your
honor,
respectfully,
that
--
her
argument
about
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
i
don't
think
is
that
this
--
this
--
she's
not
arguing
the
statute
is
an
irrational
or
unreasonable
way
to
implement
the
treaty
obligations
of
the
united
states.
what
she's
arguing
is
that
the
treaty
power
itself
does
not
give
congress
the
power
to
enact
section
229
unless,
in
essence,
you
don't
need
the
treaty,
because
you
already
have
the
power,
the
government
does,
under
the
first
17
clauses
of
article
i,
section
8.
so,
yes,
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
is
the
connection
here
to
article
i,
section
8,
but
it's
a
minimal
connection,
and
--
and
she's
not
arguing
sort
of
the
--
the
--
i
don't
think,
the
comstock
kind
of
argument
that
this
isn't
tied
to,
rationally,
to
some
sort
of
articulated
power.
the
government
clearly
has
power
to
enter
treaties
under
article
ii,
section
2,
and
so
that
to
me
is
the
distinguishing
feature
from
all
those
other
article
i,
section
8,
cases.
this
--
i
agree;
i
don't
think
i
could
stand
up
here
and
--
and
try
to
argue
to
you
this
is
a
true
tenth
amendment
case
if,
in
fact,
this
had
been
litigated
as
a
commerce
power
case
all
along.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
no,
i'm
not
sure
that's
what
i
meant
to
say,
justice
alito.
what
--
what
i
was
trying
to
say
is
her
argument
is
not
--
well,
i
think
her
argument
is
in
essence
a
challenge
to
the
treaty
power.
it's
one
step
removed,
but
it
is
a
challenge
to
the
treaty
power,
because
she
says
the
statute
has
to
be
based
on
something
in
article
i,
section
8,
first
17
clauses;
and
if
it's
based
on
something
there,
then
the
treaty
power
adds
nothing
to
congress's
ability
to
enact
legislation;
and
that's
inconsistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
the
fact
that
the
treaty
power
is
in
article
ii,
not
in
article
i,
section
8.
and
so
under
her
view
of
the
world
--
as
i
understand
it;
i'm
sure
mr.
clement
will
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
my
understanding
--
is
that
really
you
don't
need
a
treaty,
the
treaty
doesn't
add
anything.
i
mean,
it
may
be
the
reason
that
congress
decides
at
this
point
in
time
to
enact
section
229.
but
i
believe,
as
i
understood
her
argument,
if
it
has
the
commerce
power
to
do
it,
united
states
never
entered
--
needed
to
enter
a
treaty
in
order
for
congress
to
enact
section
229.
so
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
her
argument,
the
treaty
power
adds
nothing
to
the
domestic
legislative
authority
of
congress.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
not
in
this
court,
justice
ginsburg,
but
there
are
examples
in
the
circuits,
a
few.
there
are
examples
from
the
eighth
circuit,
from
the
tenth
circuit
involving
criminal
prosecutions
where
the
court
characterized
the
claim
as
a
tenth
amendment
claim
and
said,
in
light
of
tva,
the
criminal
defendant
does
not
have
standing
to
make
that
claim.
so
there
are
examples
in
the
lower
courts.
i'm
not
aware
of
an
example
in
this
court.
and
i
would
say
this,
too,
about
the
--
there's
some
argument
about
the
separation
of
powers
cases
in
which
the
court
has
typically
allowed
individuals
to
make
that
claim.
again,
because
we're
talking
about
prudential
rules
and
third-party
standing,
or
at
least
i'm
talking
about
that,
one
prudential
consideration
is
in
those
cases,
whether
it's
chadha,
whether
it's
clinton
v.
new
york,
the
recent
free
enterprise
case,
the
federal
government
is
always
very
much
present.
it
may
be
representing
the
defendant
in
those
cases,
it
may
simply
intervene
or
come
in
as
an
amicus,
it
gets
notice
if
the
federal
statute
is
challenged
as
being
unconstitutional.
the
difference
in
the
tenth
amendment
setting
is
there's
no
mechanism,
practically,
to
notify
the
states
or
solicit
the
states
for
their
interests.
someone's
raising
this
claim
that
says
the
government
is
intruding
on
your
sovereign
interests;
there's
no
mechanism
to
allow
the
states.
now,
if
--
if
states
are
aware
of
it
and
come
and
ask
to
file
an
amicus,
perhaps
they
would
be
allowed
to,
but
there's
no
mechanism
that
ensures--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--well,
the
state
isn't
a
party,
but
what
gets
said
in
those
cases
about
the
scope
of
the
state's
prerogatives
vis
--
vis
the
federal
government
could
well
be
brought
to
bear
in
other
cases
in
other
settings,
commandeering
cases.
again,
the
concern
in
the
third-party
standing
case
is
that
you're
not
actually
a
party,
but
someone
else
is
making
arguments
in
a
sense
on
your
behalf.
they
lose,
because
perhaps
they
don't
know
all
of
the
arguments
they
should
be
making
or
they
don't
articulate
them
the
way
the
state
does
--
there's
still
stare
decisis
effect
of
those
decisions
on
the
states.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
i
guess
again,
and
maybe
i'm
misapprehending,
but
the
long-term
interest
is
a
--
is
a
decision,
say
in
the
criminal
case,
that
says,
no,
this
doesn't
intrude
on
the
state's
sovereignty,
is
there
as
a
matter
of
stare
decisis.
so
if
in
a
later
case
the
state
wants
to
in
fact
assert
that
this
particular
statute
does
intrude
on
our
sovereignty,
it's
not
that
they
can't
necessarily
raise
the
claim,
but
they
will
confront
contrary
precedent
that
the
state
never
had
a
chance
to
--
to
voice
its
opinion
or
its
views
at
the
time
the
issue
was
being
adjudicated.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
say
they
have
no
interest,
but
i
am
--
i
guess
the
premise
i'm
asserting
is
they
do
not
necessarily
get
to
assert
the
tenth
amendment
claim
of
the
states.
new
york
v.
united
states,
for
example,
was
a
case
where
the
state
initially
said
we're
not
concerned
about
this
regulation,
and
then
changed
its
mind;
and
the
court
in
new
york
said
states
don't
waive
those
tenth
amendment
rights;
states
can
then
--
can
change
its
mind
and
bring
a
suit,
and
there's
no
indication--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--well,
and
that's
a
conclusion
the
court
can
reach.
but
what
--
what
the
petitioner's
position
essentially
holds
is
that
there's
never
a
question
of
third-party
standing
for
any
claim
under
the
constitution,
basically,
not
the
kind
i'm
talking
about;
and
that
no
claims
are
limited
to
certain
categories
of
litigants.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
and
that's
--
but
you're
talking
now
really
the
causality;
that's
an
article
iii
inquiry.
and
again,
what
i'm
trying
to
talk
about
is
separate,
the
next
step,
the
prudential
third-party
standing.
and
i
think
petitioner's
view
is
third-party
standing
is
just
out
the
window,
whether
it's
separation
of
powers,
tenth
amendment,
anything.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
thank
you.
