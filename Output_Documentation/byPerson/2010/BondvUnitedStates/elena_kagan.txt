justice
elena
kagan
mr.
clement,
in
the
case
before
us,
are
you
making
any
claims
other
than
that
congress
was
acting
outside
its
enumerated
powers
in
enacting
this
statute?
are
there
any
peculiarly
tenth
amendment
claims
that
you're
making?
in
other
words,
you
admit
that
congress
is
acting
within
its
enumerated
powers
and
yet
the
action
violates
the
tenth
amendment.
are
you
making
any
claims
of
that
sort,
or
are
all
your
claims
that
the
statute
here
goes
beyond
congress's
ability
to
enact
it
under
article
i?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
let's
just
use
the
printz
case
and
say,
even
though
congress
might
have
the
ability
to
enact
a
statute
under
article
i,
there's
an
independent
tenth
amendment
limitation.
do
you
have
any
claims
of
that
kind
in
this
case?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
let's
assume,
mr.
clement,
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
claim
in
which
you're
saying,
i
can
see
that
this
is
within
congress's
article
i
powers,
but
there
is
an
independent
tenth
amendment
limitation
on
this.
do
you
have
any
claims
like
that?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
clement,
if
you
are
not
making
a
commandeering
claim,
then
we
would
be
going
out
of
our
way
to
decide
that
question.
and
so,
you
know,
are
you
making
a
commandeering
claim?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
dreeben,
why
shouldn't
the
defendant
be
able
to
raise
that
argument?
if
the
defendant
prevails
on
that
argument,
presumably
the
statute
is
invalidated
and
the
conviction
is
overthrown.
so
why
doesn't
the
defendant
have
the
appropriate
interest
to
raise
that
argument?
justice
elena
kagan
but
that's
a
merits
question.
that's
not
a
standing
question.
why
don't
we
just
say
the
defendant
has
standing
to
raise
it,
and
then
he'll
lose?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
mcallister,
i
guess
i
don't
understand
why
that
makes
a
difference.
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
says
"foregoing
powers"
and
it
says
"other
powers".
this
happens
to
be
a
case
where
congress
is
acting
under
the
other
powers
part
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
but
the
question
in
either
event
is
the
extent
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
and
what
it
allows
congress
to
do.
so
in
--
in
that
sense,
whether
it's
a
treaty
power
case
or
not
a
treaty
power
case
just
doesn't
matter.
it's
all
a
question
of
what
congress's
scope
of
authority
is
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
