let's
assume
in
this
hypothetical
--
just
that
case,
tva.
state
--
the
federal
government
sets
the
price,
and
someone's
accused
of
violating
that
price.
can
that
defendant
come
in
and
say,
just
as
in
tva,
that's
unconstitutional
because
prices
have
to
be
set
by
the
state?
can
the
defendant
say
that,
or
is
that
an
anticommandeering
claim
that
you
say
they're
barred
from
raising?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
my
question
goes
back
to
one
that's
been
asked
before,
which
is,
give
me
a
hypothetical
of
a
defendant
who
has
been
convicted
where
it
would
be
a
pure
anticommandeering
claim
that
you
say
they
have
no
standing
for.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
that
analysis
differ
in
any
way
because
this
is
a
treaty
power
claim
versus
a
commerce
clause
claim?
your
briefs
go
back
and
forth
on
which
one
it
is.
your
reply
brief
now
emphasizes
commerce
clause
power,
but
your
main
brief
was
saying
this
is
a
treaty
provision
challenge.
do
they
differ?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
what
do
you
see
specifically?
because
there's
a
lot
of
discussion
about
labels
and
what
the
labels
mean
in
this
case.
but
tell
me
specifically
what
--
not
the
word
she
uses,
but
the
specific
ways
in
which
prudential
considerations
bar
her
standing;
meaning:
what
about
the
nature
of
her
claim
prudentially
should
counsel
us
against
giving
her
standing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
pennsylvania
would
be
upset
that
the
federal
government
got
her
when
they
couldn't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
just
articulate
for
me
--
we're
speaking
in
generalities
--
what
in
the
nature
of
her
claim,
taking
the
labels
away,
do
you
think
is
a
pure
tenth
amendment
challenge?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
i
read
her
complaint,
and
it's
always
that
it's
a
tenth
amendment
claim
because
congress
and
the
president
have
exceeded
their
powers
in
some--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that's
--
you
haven't
answered
my
--
my
question.
why
isn't
that
a
merits
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
president
and
congress
have
the
power
to
enact
this
legislation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
that
an
issue
for
a
civil
lawsuit
as
opposed
to
a
criminal
one?
because
all
that
would
happen
in
a
criminal
suit
is
that
the
defendant's
conviction
would
be
undone,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
is
bound
in
some
way.
the
state
wasn't
a
party
to
the
criminal
action.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
there's
two
things
that
could
happen.
one
is
that
if
the
state
loses,
then
--
and
it
doesn't
want
to
lose
--
it
passes
its
own
law.
or
if
it
wins,
if
the
case
is
as
stated
below,
it
just
lets
the
status
quo
go.
i
still
don't
understand
what
the
long-term
injury
to
the
state
is
or
could
be.
