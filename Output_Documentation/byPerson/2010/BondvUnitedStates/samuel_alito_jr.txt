justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can't
there
be
some
tenth
amendment
claims
that
go
just
to
state
prerogatives
and
not
to
the
rights
of
individuals?
let's
say
there's
a
federal
statute
that
purports
to
regulate
where
a
state
locates
its
capital,
or
the
--
the
contents
of
a
state
flag,
something
like
that.
wouldn't
that
go
just
to
state
prerogatives
and
not
to
individual
rights?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
problem
is
if
you're
just
making
a
treaty
power
claim,
then
how
are
you
going
to
possibly
win
on
remand
in
the
third
circuit
if
we
reverse
and
say
that
your
--
your
client
has
standing?
do
you
think
it
falls
within
the
prerogatives
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
that
missouri
v.
holland
was
wrong?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
that
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
chemical
that's
involved?
suppose
the
chemical
was
--
was
something
that
people
would
normally
understand
as
the
kind
of
chemical
that
would
be
used
in
a
chemical
weapon?
let's
say
it's
sarin
does
it
matter
that
this
case
doesn't
involve
something
like
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
they
argue
--
what
if
she
argues
on
remand,
if
there
is
a
remand,
that,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
congress
can
enact
any
law
that
is
necessary
and
proper
to
implement
a
treaty?
the
tenth
amendment
prohibits
certain
laws
that
intrude
too
heavily
on
state
law
enforcement
prerogatives,
state
police
power.
if
she
makes
that
argument,
which
category
does
that
fall
into?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
a
correct
characterization
of
the
argument
that
was
made
in
--
in
the
tennessee
electric
case.
i
--
i'm
looking
at
the
brief
in
the
case,
and
the
discussion
of
the
tenth
amendment
generally
follows
a
caption
that
says
the
power
to
dispose
of
federal
property
does
not
include
any
power
to
regulate
local
activities.
i
don't
understand
why
that
isn't
the
same
kind
of
delegated
powers
argument
that
you
say
the
petitioner
here
is
raising.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
given
the
breadth
of
this
statute,
that
would
be
a
very
far-reaching
decision,
wouldn't
it?
suppose
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
decided
to
retaliate
against
her
former
friend
by
pouring
a
bottle
of
vinegar
in
the
friend's
goldfish
bowl.
as
i
read
this
statute,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
this
statute,
potentially
punishable
by
life
imprisonment,
wouldn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
she
possesses
a
chemical
weapon.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
a
chemical
weapon
is
a
weapon
that
includes
toxic
chemicals.
and
a
toxic
chemical
is
a
chemical
that
can
cause
death
to
animals.
and
pouring
vinegar
in
a
goldfish
bowl,
i
believe,
will
cause
death
to
the
goldfish,
so
that's
--
that's
a
chemical
weapon.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
difference
is
that
raich
involved
one
commodity,
right?
marijuana.
this
involves
potentially
thousands
and
thousands
of
chemicals.
and
you
would
have
--
you
would
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
every
one
of
those
chemicals
if
you
take
together
all
of
the
people
who
are
--
who
would
use
vinegar
to
kill
goldfish
or
all
the
people
who
might
use
antifreeze
to
kill
dogs,
you
put
all
of
that
together,
that
has
a
substantial
effect
on
the
interstate,
the
interstate
market
for
antifreeze
or
for
vinegar?
that
would
be
the
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
what
you
just
said.
are
you
saying
that
--
that
she
is
arguing
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
enact
legislation
that's
necessary
and
proper
for
the
implementation
of
treaties,
but
only
for
the
making
of
treaties;
that
she's
making
that
argument
that's
been
made
by
some
academic
writers?
