justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
our
--
any
of
our
opinions
talk
about
the
standing
of
the
defendant?
i
can't
think
of
one
at
the
moment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
want
us
to
say
that
when
there
is
a
specific
injury,
specific
to
your
client,
that
your
client
has
the
right
to
make
any
argument
to
show
that
the
government
has
exceeded
its
powers
under
the
constitution,
because
those
powers
are
limited
to
protect
the
liberties
of
the
individual?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
--
you
want
us
to
say
that,
even
if
the
defendant
in
some
case
might
show
that
a
constitutional
violation
is
causing
that
defendant
specific
injury,
the
defendant
may
not
be
able
to
raise
the
claim
of
its,
what
you
call
sovereignty
claim?
in
thornton
v.
arkansas,
the
term
limits
case,
we
allowed
a
citizen
of
a
state
to
bring
a
challenge
to
a
statute
that
the
state
had
enacted
inconsistent
with
its
federal
powers.
now,
that's
the
flip
side.
that
was
a
state
statute,
not
a
federal
statute,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
position
you're
taking.
and
it
seems
to
me
also
consistent
--
inconsistent
with
the
rule
that
separation
of
powers
claims
can
be
presented
by
defendants,
in
chadha
v.
ins,
clinton
v.
new
york,
a
line-item
veto
case.
the
whole
point
of
separation
of
powers,
the
whole
point
of
federalism,
is
that
it
inheres
to
the
individual
and
his
or
her
right
to
liberty;
and
if
that
is
infringed
by
a
criminal
conviction
or
in
any
other
way
that
causes
specific
injury,
why
can't
it
be
raised?
i
just
don't
understand
your
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
all
you're
saying
is
that
there's
--
in
that
hypothetical
is
that
there's
no
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
everybody
goes
home.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
a
state
wanted
to
be
commandeered
in
printz?
suppose
they
said,
we
really
like
having
sheriffs
take
the
federal
gun
registration
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
have
--
i
have
--
i
have
serious
trouble
with
that.
a
state
can
surrender
its
--
its
--
a
state
can
confer
more
authority
on
the
federal
government
than
the
constitution
does?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
underlying
premise
is
that
the
individual
has
no
interest
in
whether
or
not
the
state
has
surrendered
its
powers
to
the
federal
government,
and
i
just
don't
think
the
constitution
was
framed
on
that
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
began
with
a
bitter
personal
dispute,
carol
anne
bond
is
the
petitioner
here.
she
learned
that
a
woman
who
was
her
close
friend
was
pregnant
and
that
the
father
was
bond's
husband.
bond
sought
revenge.
she
put
caustic
substances
on
--
substances
on
objects
the
woman
was
likely
to
touch
like
her
mailbox
and
the
front
door
handle
and
the
door
handles
of
the
woman's
car.
a
federal
investigation
followed
and
bond
was
charged
in
united
states
district
court
with
two
counts
of
violating
18
u.s.c.
section
229.
the
section
229
was
enacted
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
or
implement
provisions
of
a
chemical
weapons
treaty
that
was
ratified
by
united
states
in
1997
and
the
statute
forbids
the
knowing
possession
or
use
non-peaceful
purposes
of
any
chemical
that
can
cause
death,
temporary
incapacitation
or
permanent
harm
to
humans
or
animals.
bond
raised
the
constitutional
objection
to
the
prosecution.
she
argued
that
by
enacting
section
229,
congress
exceeded
its
powers
under
the
constitution.
the
statute,
bond
argued,
intrudes
upon
the
sovereignty
and
authority
of
the
states.
relying
on
the
tenth
amendment,
she
contended
that
at
least
in
the
present
instance
the
federal
treaty
cannot
be
the
source
of
congressional
power
to
regulate
or
prohibit
her
conduct.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
concluded
that
because
no
state
had
intervened,
bond
lacked
standing
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
section
229
on
tenth
amendment
grounds.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
because
the
government
unlike
its
earlier
position
later
did
concede
that
bond
has
standing,
an
amicus
curiae
was
appointed
to
defend
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
hereto
the
brief
and
oral
argument
presented
to
the
court
by
the
amicus
has
been
--
have
been
of
considerable
assistance
to
the
court.
we
do
now
determine
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
reversed.
in
reaching
the
conclusion
of
no
standing,
the
court
for
appeals
relied
on
a
single
sentence
from
this
court's
--
this
1939
decision
in
tennessee
electric
power
company
versus
tva.
in
that
sentence
has
been
the
source
of
disagreement
and
confusion
in
various
courts
of
appeals.
we
now
hold
that
the
sentence
should
be
treated
as
no
longer
controlling
or
instructive.
in
defense
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
amicus
invoked
the
more
general
principle
that
a
litigant
cannot
risk
his
claim
for
relief
on
the
legal
rights
or
interest
of
third
parties.
in
the
view
of
the
amicus
argue
that
national
government
has
interfered
with
state
sovereignty
in
violation
of
the
tenth
amendment
is
to
assert
only
a
right
or
an
interest
pertaining
to
states
as
such
and
not
to
individuals.
we
conclude
that
is
not
so.
it
is
true
that
the
federal
structures
established
these
boundaries
between
the
states
and
the
national
government
for
their
own
integrity.
but
federalism
has
more
than
one
dynamic.
it
also
secures
the
freedom
of
the
individual.
it
allows
states
to
respond
through
the
enactment
of
laws,
to
the
initiative
of
those
who
seek
a
voice
in
shaping
the
destiny
of
their
own
times
and
by
denying
any
one
government
complete
jurisdiction
overall
the
concerns
of
public
life,
federalism
helps
protect
the
liberty
of
the
individual
from
arbitrary
power.
fidelity,
the
principles
of
federalism
is
not
for
the
states
alone
to
vindicate.
an
individual
has
a
direct
interest
in
objecting
to
laws
that
upset
the
balance
between
the
national
and
state
governments.
of
course,
a
person
who
challenges
government
action
on
federalism
grounds
is
subject
to
article
iii
in
prudential
limitations
applicable
to
all
litigants.
these
include
the
requirements
of
an
injury
in
fact
traceable
to
the
government's
conduct
and
redressable
by
judicial
decision.
but
when
those
requirements
are
met
as
they
are
here,
there
is
no
further
restriction
applicable
to
tenth
amendment
challenges.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
remanded.on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
may
consider
the
merits
of
bond's
tenth
amendment
arguments
in
the
first
instance.
the
decision
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
joins.
