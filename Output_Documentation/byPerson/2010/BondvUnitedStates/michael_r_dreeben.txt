mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
petitioner
confirmed
this
morning,
the
central
claim
that
he
is
making
about
the
unconstitutionality
of
section
229
is
that
it
exceeds
congress's
enumerated
powers.
he
may
wish
to
raise
as
part
of
that
claim
a
argument
that
it
invades
the
province
that
belongs
to
the
states
concerning
criminal
law.
he
can
do
that.
he
has
the
authority
to
make
such
a
challenge.
the
third
circuit
erred
in
holding
to
the
contrary.
now,
the
third
circuit
in
reaching
the
contrary
conclusion
relied
on
this
court's
decision
in
tennessee
electric
v.
tva,
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
misread
that
case
in
concluding
that
it
barred
standing,
not
because
it
lacks
a
holding
that
does
bar
standing
of
certain
types
of
claims
that
allege
an
invasion
of
state
sovereignty,
but
because
the
kind
of
claim
that
petitioner
is
making
is
not
a
tenth
amendment
reserved
rights
claim,
but
instead
an
enumerated
powers
claim.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
the
defendant
needs
to
be
put
in
any
trouble
in
this
case
because
the
kind
of
claim
that
counsel
is
making
on
her
behalf
does
assert
her
right
not
to
be
subject
to
criminal
punishment
under
a
law
that
he
says,
counsel
says,
congress
lacks
the
authority
to
enact.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
falls
into
the
enumerated
powers
category,
justice
alito,
just
as
last
term
in
united
states
v.
comstock
one
of
the
elements
that
this
court
looked
at
when
it
decided
whether
the
law
authorizing
civil
commitment
in
that
case
was
within
congress's
enumerated
authority
plus
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
the
court
looked
at
the
extent
to
which
the
law
accommodated
state
interests
or,
alternatively,
invaded
them
in
an
unlawful
manner,
which
is
what
mr.
comstock
had
alleged
in
that
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
--
i
don't
take
issue
with
almost
everything
that
you
said.
the
structural
protections
of
the
constitution
can
be
enforced
by
individuals
under
the
cases
that
you
have
cited.
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
two
things.
first
of
all,
a
statement
that
this
court
made
in
tva
that
was
part
of
its
holding,
addressed
to
what
the
court
perceived
as
an
attack
based
on
a
specific
aspect
of
state
sovereignty
that
belonged
to
the
states.
now,
today,
we
might
not
understand
the
claim
that
was
made
in
that
case
as
implicating
a
specific
sovereign
right
that's
protected
under
the
tenth
amendment.
today
we
might
look
at
it
and
say
this
is
nothing
other
than
a
conventional
preemption
claim.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
may
be,
justice
alito.
i
think
that
it's
a
little
bit
difficult
to
parse
precisely
what
the
petitioner
in
tennessee
electric
was
arguing,
but
this
court
understood
the
claim
as
one
that
--
that
bore
on
federal
regulation
of
purely
local
matters
in
a
matter
that
regulated
the
internal
affairs
of
the
state;
and
i
agree
with
you
that
today
we
might
not
view
that
as
a
tenth
amendment-specific
claim,
but
this
court
did
in
1939.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
understand
that,
justice
breyer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well
i
think
if
you
intrude
today's
analytical
model--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--under
today's
jurisprudence,
that
is
how
the
case
would
be
viewed.
but
it
was
not
how
it
was
viewed
at
the
time
of
tva.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
language
from
the
sentence,
justice
breyer,
that
you
in
fact
read--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--discussing
whether
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
state
objection
mattered,
the
court
said:
as
we've
seen
there's
no
objection
from
the
state,
and
if
this
were
not
so
the
appellants,
absent
the
states
or
their
officers,
have
no
standing
to
raise
any
objection
under
the
amendment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
not
an
anti-commandeering
claim.
that
is
the
kind
of
claim
that
today
we
would
conceptualize
as
an
enumerated
powers
claim.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
will
take
me
back
to
--
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
because
i
wanted
to
answer
the
part
that
i
thought
distinguished
a
commandeering
case
from
what
justice
kennedy
was
talking
about.
and
the
point
is
best
made
in
the
context
of
an
example.
under
the
sex
offender
registration
act,
defendants
have
challenged
the
law
on
numerous
grounds,
including,
number
one,
congress
lacks
its
constitutional
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
to
criminalize
the
individual
registration
requirement
imposed
on
them.
all
courts
that
have
addressed
that
have
said
that's
a
claim
that's
within
the
cognizance
of
a
defendant
to
bring.
defendants
have
also
said
the
sorna
statute
violates
federal
law
because
it
requires
states
to
accept
sex
offender
registrations.
it
commandeers
the
states
into
requiring
them
to
set
up
a
sex
offender
database.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
kagan,
this
is
the
absolutely
crucial
point
that
distinguishes
commandeering
from
most
of
the
structural
constitutional
provisions
that
we've
been
discussing
this
morning.
a
state
can
choose
to
establish
a
sex
offender
database
and
to
receive
registrations
from
people
who
are
required
to
register
under
federal
law;
and
invalidating
a
federal
law
that
commanded
them
to
do
that
does
not
deprive
the
state
of
its
ability
to
say,
we
want
to
have,
in
our
autonomous
sovereign
interest,
a
sex
offender
database
that
will
receive
these
applications,
and
as
a
result--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
--
the
reason
why
in
that
hypothetical
the
defendant
should
not
raise
the
issue
is
because
there
will
be
no
violation--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--you
could
say
that,
justice
kagan,
but
i
think
that
part
of
the
enduring
force
of
tva
is
that
it
adopted
a
third-party
standing
rule
that
is
still
part
of
this
court's
jurisprudence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
court
did
say
that
there
was
no
standing
on
the
grounds
that
when
the
specific
argument
was
made,
this
takes
away
the
right
of
the
state
to
regulate
because
the
federal
government
is
regulating.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
a
major
factor
in
third-party
standing
generally,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
can
do
that.
justice
kennedy,
there's
nothing--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
justice
kennedy.
but
a
state
in
its
sovereign
decisionmaking
process
can
elect
to
participate
in
a
federal
program.
at
least,
that
was
what
justice
o'connor
said
in
her
concurrence
in
printz.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
a
perfectly
acceptable
route
of
analysis.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think
they're
different,
justice
scalia.
they
both
concern
who
holds
the
right
and
whether
there's
any
redressability--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
all
the
government
is
doing
in
this
case
is
applying
conventional
standing
principles
of
redressability
and
third-party
standing
in
a
specific
context,
which
as
mr.
clement
has
made
clear,
is
not
before
the
court
today.
this
is
not
a
commandeering
case.
that
happens
to
be
the
only
specific
aspect
of
a
state
sovereignty
claim
that
is
distinct
from
an
enumerated
powers
claim
that
the
court
has
recognized
in
recent
decades.
whether
some
other
sort
of
claim
of
state
sovereignty
might
some
day
be
recognized
and
require
its
own
analysis
is
well
beyond
the
scope
of
this
case.
our
point
is
a
much
more
basic
one.
we
agree
with
petitioner's
counsel
that
he
can
raise
the
claim
that
he
has
tried
to
raise.
we
think
that
the
third
circuit
misunderstood
what
the
tva
decision
purported
to
say
when
it
rejected
standing
for
a
type
of
state
sovereignty
claim.
and
we
think
that
the
currently
recognized
state
sovereignty
claim
of
commandeering
fits
into
the
description
of
the
analytical
category
that
was
addressed
in
tva.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
sotomayor,
i
believe
that
the
statute
is
valid
under
either
the
treaty
clause
plus
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
analysis
under
missouri
v.
holland.
it
also
can
be
sustained
in
our
view
under
the
commerce
clause,
which
follows
directly
from
what
this
court
said
in
raich
when
the
court
said
that
the
intrastate
regulation
of
a
commodity
that's
used
in
commerce
is
a
customary,
typical
method
that
congress
utilizes.
it
gave
as
examples
of
that
the
nuclear,
biological,
and
plastic
explosives
statutes
which
were
enacted
to
implement
treaty
obligations
of
the
united
states.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
not
sure,
justice
alito.
i
will
assume
with
you
that
it
is.
the
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
sure
that
vinegar
is
a
chemical
weapon.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
willing
to
make
the
assumption
with
you
and
accept
that
it
is
a
broad-reaching
statute,
but
it
was
adopted
as
a
broad-reaching
statute
because
this
is
an
area,
like
the
medical
marijuana
instance
in
raich,
where
effective
control
of
the
interstate
market
requires
control
of
an
intrastate
market.
the
statute
exempts
peaceful
uses
for
agricultural
and
pharmaceutical
purposes
of
these
chemicals,
it
has
other
exemptions
as
well.
it
was
intended
to
be
a
comprehensive
ban
that
implemented
the
united
states
treaty
obligations
to
eliminate
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
both
in
military
instances
and
in
terrorism,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
it's
pretty
well
recognized,
justice
alito,
that
when
congress
seeks
to
regulate
an
interstate
market
as
to
which
there
cannot
be
any
question
under
the
commerce
clause
congress
could
do,
it
can
control
the
intrastate
market
as
necessary
in
order
to
assure
that
its
prohibition
is
effective.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
a
lot
further
than
i
had
intended,
justice
ginsburg.
the
merits
of
the
case,
though,
involve
both
a
commerce
clause
argument,
a
treaty-based
argument.
as
far
as
the
standing
principles
go,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
difference
between
them.
missouri
v.
holland
was
a
case
in
which
this
court
adjudicated
whether
a
law
exceeded
congress's
enumerated
authority.
it
did
that
at
the
behest
of
a
state,
but
there
is
no
reason
why
under
cases
like
lopez
and
sabri
and
perez
that
an
enumerated
powers
argument
is
in
any
way
off
limits
to
a
criminal
defendant.
it's
not.
if
this
case
does
go
back
down
to
the
third
circuit,
a
petitioner
can
make
the
argument
that
this
law
exceeds
the
enumerated
powers.
we
can
rely
on
the
treaty
clause.
it
doesn't
affect
standing
in
any
way.
i
think
that
the
amicus
in
support
of
the
judgment
makes
the
assumption
that
because
missouri
v.
holland
is
good
law,
there's
no
possible
claim
that
petitioner
can
make
that
the
law
would
exceed
congress's
enumerated
authority.
therefore,
the
amicus
says
this
must
be
some
sort
of
a
special
state
sovereignty
claim
of
a
genre
that
looks
like
commandeering,
perhaps
not
articulated
quite
light
that.
we
don't
understand
petitioner
to
be
making
that
argument.
i
think
petitioner
confirmed
today
that's
not
what
she's
trying
to
do,
and
there
is
no
tenth
amendment
claim
based
on
a
specific
aspect
of
state
sovereignty
that
petitioner
has
ever
made.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
petitioner's
brief
in
support
of
the
rehearing
petition,
petitioner
said
the
tenth
amendment
argument
raised
by
bond
was
not
critical
to
bond's
other
constitutional
challenges.
it
is
ancillary
to
bond's
main
argument
that
congress
acted
outside
of
its
enumerated
powers.
i
think
that's
a
correct
understanding
of
what
petitioner
has
sought
to
argue
in
the
court
below.
in
our
view,
she
is
entitled
to
make
that
argument.
that
argument
should
also
fail
on
the
merits,
but
that
is
not
an
issue
that
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
decide.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
as
justice
alito
pointed
out,
the
court
has
indicated
that
moving
a
state
capital,
a
direction
to
move
the
state
capital,
might
be
an
intrusion
on
sovereignty.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
highly
unlikely.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
