justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
say
about
the
one
thing
--
the
strongest
point
against
you,
i
think,
is
a
single
sentence
in
that
tva
case.
it's
only
one
sentence,
but
it's
there
in
the
opinion,
and
i
think
what
it's
saying,
justice
roberts
says,
well,
he
already
finished,
he
just
finished
saying
nobody
--
congress
hasn't
violated
some
rule
against
creating
a
system
of
regulation
in
this
statute
because
it
isn't
regulation.
but
then
he
said,
but
even
if
it
were,
even
if
it
were,
and
if
your
complaint
was
that
congress
has
acted
outside
its
authority,
which
they
might
have
thought
at
that
time,
in
creating
a
system,
tva,
that
competes
with
local
systems,
even
if
that
were
so,
the
appellants,
absent
the
state
or
their
officers,
would
have
no
standing
in
this
suit
to
raise
the
question.
okay,
now,
that
--
they
put
quite
a
lot
on
to
that.
that
is
what
it
says.
so
are
we
supposed
to
say,
well,
that
was
an
ill-considered
dicta?
or
are
we
supposed
to
say
it
was
just
wrong?
are
we
supposed
to
say
the
law
has
changed?
what
in
your
view
are
we
supposed
to
--
or
is
different.
what
in
your
view
are
we
supposed
to
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
comes
out
of
left
field,
and
it's
an
overall
"any,
even,
if".
so
that
suggests
it's
just
dicta
and
doesn't
count.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
didn't
it
just
consider
it
as
outside
the
commerce
clause?
i
mean,
they
had
a
whole
lot
of
law,
but
what
is
the
distinction
between
saying,
as
they
said
then,
"court,
the
tva
regulates
electricity
rates
in
memphis
and
that's
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
enact?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
this
case,
which
--
because
of
the
tenth
amendment
and
a
lot
of
other
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
this
case
seems
the
same,
saying
it's
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
because
of
the
treaty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
know
that?
i'm
not
doubting
you;
i
just
want
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
single
sentence
doesn't
seem
--
i'm
trying
to
figure
it
out.
it
doesn't
seem
to
refer
to
just
all
tenth
amendment
claims.
there's
a
footnote
and
it
talks
about
no
standing
in
this
suit.
then
if
you
look
back
at
the
lower
court
case,
it
seemed
to
be
referring
to
a
particular
argument
where
the
challengers
had
said
the
property
clause
doesn't
give
authority
to
the
government
to
pass
this.
the
reply
was,
that
was
true
in
alabama,
and
the
court
said
it
was
okay.
then
the
challengers
say:
oh,
but
alabama
agreed.
and
then
georgia
doesn't
agree.
and
it
was
in
that
context
that
georgia
says
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
but
if
georgia
was
going
to
disagree
or
agree,
if
that's
what
it
turned
on,
we
better
have
georgia
say
whether
they
agree
or
disagree,
and
not
have
people
who
aren't
georgia.
that's
what
he
seems
to
be
saying
to
me
at
the
moment.
if
i'm
right,
what's
comparable
to
that
in
this
case?
is
there
some
claim
that
she's
making
that
it
would
be
constitutional
if
they
agreed
in
the
state
and
it
wouldn't
be
if
not?
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
she
means
it's
constitutional
irrespective.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
so
if
that's
so,
then
how
can
we
take
this
sentence
as
barred?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
it
just
says
"in
this
case".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
he
cites.
he
gives
a
footnote
and
you
read
the
page
and
you
get
an
idea.
