it's
kind
of
hard
under
our
precedents
to
draw
that
precise
line
between
enumerated
powers
and
the
tenth
amendment,
and
it
seems
a
bit
much
to
put
defendant
to
the
trouble
of
trying
to
do
that
under
the
theory
from
tva
that
they
have
no
standing
to
make
a
particular
type
of
tenth
amendment
claim.

justice

g.

pretty
harsh,
if
we're
talking
about
prudential
standing,
to
deny
that
to
a
criminal
defendant,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
do
we
have
to
do
that?
it
--
it
seems
to
me
we've
had
a
lot
of
discussion
this
morning
about
whether
this
is
an
enumerated
powers
claim
or
a
tenth
amendment
claim.
they
really
do
kind
of
blend
together,
and
it
seems
to
me
awfully
difficult
to
put
on
a
criminal
defendant
the
responsibility
to
decide
whether
this
is
going
to
be
an
enumerated
powers
claim
or
this
is
going
to
be
a
tenth
amendment
claim.
the
basic
principles
do
kind
of
merge
together,
and
why
does
it
make
--
again,
why
does
it
make
that
much
of
a
difference
and
why
do
you
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
parse
the
claim
one
way
or
another,
since
i
assume
they
can
make
pretty
much
all
the
same
arguments
under
an
enumerated
powers
--
under
the
enumerated
powers
clause--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
an
enumerated
powers
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

you,
mr.
mcallister.
chief
justice

g.
roberts,

g.
roberts,
jr.
