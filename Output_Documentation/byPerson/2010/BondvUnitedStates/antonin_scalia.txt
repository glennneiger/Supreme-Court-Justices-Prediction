justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
certainly
some
arguments
you
could
make
as
a
defendant
for
which
you
have
no
standing.
you're
saying
there's
no
argument
you
can
make
as
a
defendant
for
which
you
have
no
standing?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
raise
an
establishment
clause
objection
in
a
matter
that
--
that
does
not
involve
legislation
and
which
our
recent
opinions
say
therefore
does
not
violate
the
establishment
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
wouldn't.
all
you
--
all
you
would
have
to
know
is
that
the
claim
is
based
upon
a
statute
--
is
not
based
upon
a
statute
and
that
our
establishment
clause
jurisprudence
says
if
it's
not
based
upon
a
statute,
it
doesn't
violate
the
establishment
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
say
it's
a
free
exercise
clause
violation.
i
don't
think
you
need
the
establishment
clause
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
a
merits
question
rather
than
a
standing
question.
i
assume
we're
not
getting
into
those
merits
questions
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
but
you're
confusing
me.
i
thought
we
were
just
doing
standing.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
couldn't
you
have
said
the
same
thing
in
tva,
that,
while
companies
are
--
are
--
not
--
yes,
the
federal
--
the
federal
statute
requires
the
companies
to
charge
this
price,
but
they
might
have
decided
to
charge
it
on
their
own
anyway,
and
therefore
you
have
no
standing?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
standard
standing
doctrine
able
to
give
you
the
protection
that
you're
looking
after?
if
indeed
you
can't
tell
whether
the
state
did
it
because
it
was
compelled
to
or
because
it
wanted
to,
there
was
no
causation
and
you
don't
have
standing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
rather
use
that
route
of
analysis
than
inventing
the
new
one
that
you're
--
that
you're
urging
upon
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
let's
use
the
one
we
already
have
and
--
and
not
--
not
have
to
get
into
developing
one
that
i've
never
heard
of
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
trying
to
drive
vinegar
out
of
the
interstate
market?
do
the
people
know
you're
trying
to
do
this?
can
you
really
argue
that
this
statute
is
designed
to
drive
vinegar
out
of
the
interstate
market?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
in
a
--
in
another
case,
conceivably,
the
state
attorney
general
can
exercise
his
or
her
prosecutorial
discretion
not
to
--
not
to
prosecute
this
woman,
or
at
least
not
to
prosecute
her
under
the
antiterrorism
law
that
gives
her
8
years.
isn't
that
something
for
the
state
to
be
concerned
about?
we
want
to
have
the
discretion
of
whether
to
prosecute
or
not
for
standard
crimes
that
have
no
relation
to
interstate
commerce
or
any
other
federal
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
she
wants
to
make
the
argument
that
the
definitions
don't
overlap.
she
wants
to
make
the
argument
that
this
is
a
strictly
state,
local
crime,
and
that
any
--
any
attempt
by
the
federal
government
to
convert
it
into
a
treaty-based
terrorism
crime
is
--
is
erroneous.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
she's
trying
to
do.
why
doesn't
she
have
standing
to
make
that
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
does
--
it
does
assume,
as
justice
kennedy
said,
that
the
reason
that
is
there
in
the
constitution
is
only
for
the
benefits
of
the
states,
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
in
the
states.
so
if
a
state
chooses
to
give
it
away,
the
--
the
individual
has
--
has
no
standing.
you
say
it's
third
party,
we're
raising
the
states'
rights.
i
think
what
the
other
sides
is
arguing;
this
is
not
a
right
of
the
states,
it's
a
right
of
the
individual
to
have
the
state
take
charge
of
certain
matters
and
the
federal
government
take
charge
of
other
matters.
i
don't
see
why
that's
any
different
from
an
article
i,
section
8
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
--
there's
a
question
of
causality,
so
some
of
them
will
--
will
not
be
valid
because
you
can't
show
that
the
--
that
the
state
was
coerced
into
doing
something
and
therefore
you
can't
show
that
the
violation
of
the
constitution
caused
your
injury.
