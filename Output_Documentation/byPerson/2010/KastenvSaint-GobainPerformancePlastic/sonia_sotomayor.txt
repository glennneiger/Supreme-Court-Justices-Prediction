justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
mean
that
if
the
government
says
you've
got
to
file
a
complaint
with
us
by
either
calling
us
or
submitting
something
in
writing,
and
at
a
cocktail
party
a
worker
goes
up
to
a
government
employee
in
that
agency,
and
says,
you
know,
my
company
is
violating
the
law.
that
that's
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
reason
i'm
asking
that
question
is
related
to
justice
alito's
question,
which
is,
what
does
filing
a
complaint
mean?
does
it
have
to
be
relative
to
the
procedures
adopted
by
the
person
that
you
are
reporting
this
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
at
a
cocktail
party
that
employee
may
be
there
on
personal
time,
but
when
he
goes
back
to
work
the
next
morning
he
could
do
something.
is
that
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
you
are
doing
is
he
is
estopping
the
government
from
saying,
the
only
way
that
you
can
file
a
complaint
with
us
is
to
do
it
in
writing.
we
are
now
forcing
the
government
to
adopt
an
oral
procedure
even
if
it
chose
not
to?
even
if
it
thought
an
oral
procedure
would
create
havoc,
et
cetera,
et
cetera?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
does
file
--
what
is
the
meaning
of
"filed"?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
is
it
inherently
unworkable
here
in
any
greater
extent
that
it
is
unworkable
in
all
of
the
other
statutes
where
oral
complaints
are
permitted?
what
makes
this
worse
than
these
other
statutes?
what
would
create
more
cases
in
this
area
as
opposed
to
some
of
the
other
areas?
oral
complaints
are
explicitly--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--this
is
the
--
this
was
the
lochner
era
where
they
weren't
even
sure
they
could
do
this.
but
why
should
we
read
their
language
with
a
narrow
reading
of
any
complaint?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
grievance
--
would
the
bringing
of
a
grievance,
the
example
that
justice
breyer
suggested,
an
employee
goes
to
his
union
and
says,
they
are
violating
the
statute.
let's
grieve
it.
and
according
to
the
proceedings
established
by
the
employer,
they
meet
with
the
employer,
and
the
employee
does
everything
in
the
grievance
and
they
now
fire
that
employee.
under
your
reading,
that's
not
instituting
a
proceeding?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
we
have
to
address
your
second
question,
not
the
first.
you
are
saying
the
oral
wouldn't
work
in
there?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
it
work
if
they
instituted
a
proceeding
orally
and
the
proceeding
required
itself
to
start
orally?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
we
should
give
it
no
weight
at
all?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
even
skidmore?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
long
have
collective
bargaining
arbitration
agreements
been
in
existence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
old?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
that
when
congress
wrote
or
caused
to
be
instituted
any
proceeding
under
or
related
to
this
chapter,
that
they
intended
to
exclude
that
proceeding
and
intended
to
exclude
people
who
testified
in
that
proceeding
about
a
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
point
me
to
something
in
the
act
that
defines
"proceedings"--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--"related"
--
the
words
"proceedings
related
to
this
chapter",
as
limited
only
to
government
proceedings?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
we're
back
to
if
congress
meant
filing
any
complaints,
either
oral
or
in
writing.
i'm
asking
a
different
question,
which
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
congress's
intent
was
not
to
protect
a
worker
who
publicly
took
an
oath
in
front
of
an
arbitrator
and
testified
about
a
violation
of
law,
that
they
would
not
have
considered
that
retaliatory
under
the
statute.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
goes
to
your
adversary's
first
argument
or
second
argument
where
he
says
when
this
act
was
passed
for
all
of
those
people,
they
would
never
have
thought
of
going
to
their
employer
because
the
work
ethos
at
the
time
was
that
those
employees
couldn't
complain
to
their
employers.
they
would
always
naturally
go
to
the
government.
how
do
you
answer
that?
how
do
you
disprove
that
point:
that
historically
at
the
time
this
was
passed
in
1938,
that
there
was
a
number
of
those
employees
who
as
a
regular
course
of
their
business,
filed
complaints
with
their
employers
as
opposed
to
the
government?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
