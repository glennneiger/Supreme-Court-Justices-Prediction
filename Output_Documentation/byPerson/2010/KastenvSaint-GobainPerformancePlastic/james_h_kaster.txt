mr.
james
h.
kaster
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
kevin
kasten
told
his
employer
that
the
location
of
the
time
clocks
was
illegal
and
that
if
they
were
taken
to
the
court
they
would
lose,
he
filed
any
complaint
within
the
meaning
of
the
215(a)(3)
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
because
filing
includes
an
oral
communication,
because
"any"
means
any,
which
includes
formal
or
informal,
written
or
unwritten
communications.
and
the
words
in
the
statute
were
designed
to
have
a
broad
construction
under
section
2
of
the
statute
202
and
under
mitchell
v.
demario
and
the
tennessee
coal
case.
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
tennessee
coal
case,
tennessee
coal
v.
muscoda.
the
court
interpreted
"work"
in
a
broad
fashion
to
include
the
time
in
a
mine
when
workers
were
moving
from
one
place
to
another,
not
actually
engaged
in
physical
labor.
in
interpreting
work
that
way,
the
court
said
that
the
act
is
not
to
be
interpreted
in
a
narrow,
grudging
fashion.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
the
employer
has
a
policy
that
says
you
do
it
on
tuesday
morning
would
control
what
the
statute
says
one
way
or
the
other,
so
i
think
it
would
constitute
a
filing.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
i
don't
--
you
know,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
--
in
the
context
of
a
non-work
environment,
your
honor,
i
would
note
that,
i
don't
know
exactly
the
answer
to
the
court's
question,
to
be
honest.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
filing
means
directing
it
to
somebody
who
can
do
something
about
it.
and
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
well,
it
may
be.
if
it's
directed
towards
the
responsible
party,
then
it
would
be
filing
a
complaint.
so
it
could
occur
outside
of
work--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--if
the
person
is
directing
the
complaint
to
the
government
and
communicates
that
to
the
responsible
party
who
can
do
something
about
it,
i
think
that
they
are
filing
a
complaint,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
it
can
often
mean
a
written
communication.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
i
think
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
i
am
directing
them
to
the
court.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
there
are
no
formal
requirements
for
the
filing.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
you
might
have
a
trial,
your
honor,
depending
on
the
circumstances.
there
might
be
one.
the
thing
is
that
that's
no
different
from
any
other
retaliation
case.
they
are
trying
to
establish
an
exception
to
the
rule
that
retaliation
occurs
in
verbal
forms.
the
communication,
the
underlying
protective
conduct
occurs
in
verbal
forms
all
the
time.
they
are
trying
to
establish
the
exception
here.
and
i
would
note
that
even
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
scrivener,
filing
charges
includes
the
verbal
communications
that
are
antecedents,
the
predicates
to
filing
a
charge.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
with
the
responsible
party
who
can
do
something
about
it.
i
would
note
also,
your
honor--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--that
kevin
kasten
doesn't
have
an
office.
in
terms
of
the
formality
of
communication,
there
is
discussion
about
the
fact
that
this
occurred
in
a
hallway
outside
of
the
place
where
they
walked
in
and
out
of
the
factory.
he
doesn't
have
an
office.
that's
where
he
communicates
with
people.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
the
grievance
process,
your
honor,
a
grievance
process
is
a
formal
process,
and
so
i
wouldn't
compare
the
average
workplace--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--your
honor,
in
the
general
proposition
we
would
be
accepting
of
the
scrivener
rule
that
the
court
adopted
in
the
'70s,
that
is
that
the
filing
of
a
charge
includes
those
things
that
happened
orally
prior
to
and
around
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
charge.
that's
what
this
is
about.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
in
terms
of
the
formality
of
requirements,
the
court
may
adopt
formal
requirements.
the
employer
certainly
did,
mr.
kasten
followed
those.
what
i
am
looking
at
are
the
words
of
the
statute
that
cover
normally--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--in
terms
of
the
procedure
that
they
adopt,
your
honor,
that
may
be
an
acceptable
procedure.
the
thing
that
i
am
looking
at
is
the
statutory
language
in
the
case.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
he
didn't--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
i
don't
think
i
am
doing
that,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
it
means,
according
to
the
first
enforcement
action
back
in
1961,
it
means
submit
or
lodge,
your
honor.
i
would
note
that
the
defendant's
own
policies
use
it
to
describe
a
verbal
communication
by
protecting
against
retaliation
for
somebody
who
has
filed
a
complaint
for
sexual
harassment.
they
have
used
it
in
a
manner
that
--
as
an
example
to
obviously
include
both
verbal
and
written
communications.
i
would
note
there
was
a
procedure
in
place
here,
your
honor,
that
was
the
policy
manual.
this
--
there
was
no
grievance
procedure
for
mr.
kasten.
he
did
not
have
a--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--your
honor,
i'm
just
looking
at
the
statutory
language
--
file
"any
complaint".
it's
important
--
the
word
"any"
has
a
particular
meaning.
i
would
not
that
if--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--it
means
to
submit
or
lodge,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
i
think--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--if
i
submit
or
lodge,
that
is
the
--
and
it's
directed
at
a
particular
--
i
have
to
be
asserting
a
statutory
right.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
i
am
not
asserting--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--yes,
your
honor.
there
has
been
--
a
number
of
the
circuits
have
interpreted
this
statute
and
included
--
the
ninth
circuit,
the
first
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit
have
all--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--intracompany
complaints;
that
is
true
as
well
in
the
sixth
circuit.
and
it's
easier
to
talk
about
the
cases
where
that
hasn't
been
true
--
in
memphis
barbecue,
the
fourth
circuit;
in
genesee
hospital,
the
second
circuit.
memphis
--
the
memphis
barbecue
case
really
addresses
the
testimonial
clause.
genesee
hospital
is
the
only
case
in
the
second
circuit
where
they
have
held
that
all
complaints
need
to
go
to
the
department
of
labor.
the
one
thing
i
would
say
about
that
particular
argument,
your
honor.
is
it
makes
superfluous
instituted
proceeding.
it
makes
superfluous
instituted
proceeding
which
--
or
cause
to
be
instituted.
if
you
file
a
complaint
--
it
--
then
--
with
the
department
of
labor,
their
argument
is,
and
i
think
it's
true,
that
you
institute
a
proceeding.
so
the
statute
would
be
redundant,
and
"file
any
complaint"
would
cover
a
null
set.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
well,
your
honor,
if
you
have
made
the
phone
call
and
started
the
process
i
think
you
have
instituted
a
proceeding.
now
whether
it
gets
--
at
what
stage
of
formality
it
gets
to,
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
but
i
think
you
have
begun
the
process
of
instituting
a
proceeding
or
causing
it
to
be
instituted.
that's
one.
the
other
thing
i--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--there's
a--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--well,
your
honor,
i'm
going
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
thank
you,
your
honor.
we
have
two
agencies
here
that
have
interpreted
this
statute
this
way.
and
it's
not
just
enforcement
actions,
but
we
also
have
the
eeoc
manual.
we
also
have
other
acts.
the
surface
transportation
act--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--the
department
of
labor
administers
all
--
all
of
the--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--no.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
that
may
be
true,
your
honor.
we
have
the
identical
language
in
the
surface
transportation
act
in
osha,
which
the
agency
does
have
regulatory
power
over
and
has
interpreted
this
precise
language
to
include
oral
communications.
in
addition,
the
migrant
workers
act
--
counsel
wants
to
suggest
that
all
of
this
is
a
throwback
to
'38.
the
migrant
workers
act,
which
was
adopted
in
1982,
has
the
very
same
language.
it
is
implausible
to
suggest
that
congress
would
think
that
a
migrant
worker
was
leaving
the
field
and
writing
up
a
memo
and
bringing
it
back
to
his
supervisor
in
order
to
assert
his
statutory
rights.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
filed
any
complaint.
filed
a
complaint.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
it
goes
beyond--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--it
does
not
have
those
other
provisions,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
well,
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
i
also
suggest
that
what
we
are
talking
about
in
the
very
first
case
that
this
court
dealt
with
after
the
act
was
passed
were
coal
miners.
nobody
is
taking
--
i
don't
think
it
would
be
plausible
to
suggest
that
congress
thought
that
coal
miners
--
coal
miners,
factory
workers,
line
workers
--
they
don't
write
memos.
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
lawyers
write
memos.
people
who
this
act
was
intended
to
cover,
the
poorest
and
the
least
educated
people
in
the
country.
that's
why
under
mitchell
v.
demario
and
that's
why
under
tennessee
coal
the
court
has
taken
the
position
that
this
deserves,
has
to
have,
a
broad
interpretation.
employees
are
the
engine
that
actually
enforces
this
act.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
any
complaints,
your
honor.
filed
charges
was
the
--
was
the
previous
language
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
congress
adopted
a
different
phrase
here,
"any"
--
"filed
any
complaint"--
mr.
james
h.
kaster
--"filed
any
complaint".
in
rosenwasser,
this
court
said
that
the
criminal
liability
concerns
of
the
employer
were
addressed
by
the
word
"any".
in
other
words,
when
they
suggested
under
the
act
that
there
was
criminal
liability
and
they
didn't
know
the
piecework
employees
were
covered,
the
court
responded
in
1945,
the
word
"any"
resolves
any
kind
of
ambiguity
that
the
employer
should
have
had.
in
this
case
"any"
means
any
and
all,
and
that
is
without
limitation.
that
is
the
kind
of
complaint
that
is
protected
under
the
act.
on
december
11
--
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
kevin
kasten
asserted
his
statutory
rights.
this
is
a
case
about
form
over
substance.
form
over
substance.
that's
what
we
are
talking
about.
on
december
11,
2006,
mr.
kaster
was
fired.
the
same
date,
they
changed
the
time
clocks
so
that
everybody
else
would
get
paid,
just
as
he
complained
they
weren't
properly
legally
being
paid
before
that.
they
changed
the
clocks
the
same
day.
if
--
now,
there
were
a
half
a
million
complaints
last
year
in
the
department
of
labor.
if
the
court
should
find
that
every
complaint
needs
to
go
to
the
department
of
labor,
then
when
i
get
a
call
from
an
employee,
a
disgruntled
employee
who
says,
my
paycheck
was
wrong,
or
there
is
something
wrong
with
my
overtime
calculation,
i'm
going
to
say,
you
can't
afford
to
call
the
human
resources
department
and
have
a
conversation,
a
friendly
conversation
about
this,
because
if
you
do,
and
you
happen
to
trigger
a
statutory
assertion,
that
will
be
unprotected.
you
are
going
to
foreclose
all
the
internal
communications
that
could
occur.
mr.
james
h.
kaster
thank
you.
