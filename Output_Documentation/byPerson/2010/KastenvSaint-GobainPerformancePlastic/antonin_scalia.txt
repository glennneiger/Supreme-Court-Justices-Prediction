well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
--
that's
the
problem.
i
mean,
you
can
talk
about
a
grievance
procedure.
i
suppose
there's
always
one
in
--
in
companies
that
--
that
are
unionized,
but
an
awful
lot
of
companies
aren't.
your
--
the
--
the
respondent
is
--
is
going
to
argue
that
this
statute
doesn't
apply
to
private
filings
of
complaints
anyway,
that
it
relates
only
to
the
filing
of
a
complaint
with
the
government.
and
that
--
that's
a
new
--
a
new
point
in
this
case,
and
normally
i
would
not
be
disposed
to
consider
it.
my
problem
is,
i
cannot
decide
on
--
on
the
question
of
whether
filing
means
filing
only
in
writing
or
also
includes
verbal
filing,
without
resolving
that
other
question.
that
is
to
say,
if
indeed
the
complaint
has
to
be
quote,
"filed"
with
the
government,
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
an
oral
complaint
pursuant
to
procedures
established
by
the
agency
which
permit
an
oral
complaint,
even
a
complaint
by
telephone
that
would
be
okay.
but
my
goodness,
if
it
applies
to
private
employers
as
well
including
employers
that
have
no
grievance
procedures,
including
employers
who
have
employees
who
go
to
cocktail
parties,
i
am
--
i
am
very
disinclined
to
think
that
it
--
that
it
could
mean
an
oral
complaint
in
--
in
that
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
filing
your
argument
right
now.
now
come
on,
people
don't
talk
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that
--
that
is
absurd.
you
are
not
filing
an
argument
right
now.
nobody
uses
the
language
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that's
true.
you
--
you
can
complain
orally
to
somebody
at
the
labor
department
who
decides
that
the
complaint
isn't
serious
enough
to
--
to
warrant
commencing
a
proceeding.
i
mean,
if
you
go
in
and
insist,
i
--
you
know,
i
want
to
begin
a
proceeding,
that's
--
that's
something
else.
but
you
can
file
a
complaint
orally
without
--
without
doing
that,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
it's
never
instituted.
if
no
proceeding
is
ever
instituted,
you
can
hardly
be
accused
of
having
caused
a
proceeding
to
be
instituted.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
make
an
informal
complaint
and
it
doesn't
go
any
further,
and
they
ask
--
"you
know,
do
you
want
to
--
no,
i
don't
want
to
start
a
proceeding,
but
--
but
this
company
is
just,
you
know,
it's
acting
improperly,
you
guys
ought
to
look
into
that.
"
that's
--
i'm
00
i'm
prepared
to
say
that's
filing
a
complaint,
if
you
are
only
talking
about
filing
complaint
with
the
government.
but
if
you
are
talking
about
oral
filings
of
the
complaints
with
employer,
i
am
very
troubled.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
one
of
the
oldest,
though,
isn't
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
the
very
oldest?
it
may
well
be
the
very
oldest.
you
are
talking
about
a
really
old
fogey
congress
that
--
that
passed
this
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
is
the
language
in
those
statutes?
all
those
statutes
use
the
language
"file
a
complaint"?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
any
retaliatory
action
be
willful?
i
mean,
to
say
it's
in
retaliation
means
you
are
firing
this
person
because
of
the
complaint.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
case
would
be
a
lot
easier
if
you
didn't
try
to
have
it
both
ways,
to
say,
number
one,
it
only
applies
to
filing
a
complaint
with
the
government.
and
number
two,
you
say,
it
also
only
applies
to
written
complaints
to
the
government.
i
mean,
why
don't
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
don't
you
give
a
break
to
the
illiterate
and
let
them
file
oral
complaints
with
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
it
says
we
won't
necessarily
institute
a
proceeding,
but
we
will
regard
it
as
a
complaint?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
easier
answer
is,
"yes,
but
only
with
the
government.
"
why
isn't
that
an
easier
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
the
government's
position
on
this
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
regardless
of
whether
we
do,
why
--
why
don't
you
think
we
--
we
have
to
give
any
deference,
chevron
--
chevron
deference.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
don't
understand
how
those
agencies
have
any
part
in
the
administration
of
private
lawsuits
under
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
administers
lawsuits?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
matter
for
the
courts.
an
agency
interprets
the
statutes
that
direct
the
agency's
own
actions
if
it
has
to
enforce
things
and
so
forth.
but
where
there
is
a
provision
for
a
suit
in
court,
it
seems
to
me
it's
up
to
the
courts
to
decide
what
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
the
very
same
language?
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
remainder
of
it?
institute
a
proceeding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--be
a
member
of
a
committee?
he
is
relying
on
large
part
on
the
context
of
filing
a
complaint.
does
this
statute
have
those
other
provisions?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
big
difference.
