mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
breyer,
i
will
say
to
you
what
you
asked
me
to
say,
which
is
i
believe
if
you
get
done
listening
to
my
colleagues
on
the
other
side,
it
will
be
quite
clear
that
this
is
an
inherently
unworkable
standard
that
they
asked
us
to
adopt
under
these--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
know
that
it
is
necessarily
any
worse
in
this
particular
context.
i
do
think
what
it
suggests
is
that
the
congress
that
looked
at
this
problem,
which
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
was
the
1938
congress,
and
what
that
congress
was
saying
is
we
are
taking
a
very
dramatic
step.
we
are
moving
in
the
direction
of
federal
regulation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
you
have
to
read
their
language
as
the
way
it
was
written
and
as
the
way
they
would
have
understood
it
at
the
time,
which
was
to
file
any
complaint,
which
as
it
would
have
been
understood
in
'38
and
frankly
after
that,
when
you
file
a
complaint
that
usually
entails
some
notion
of
formality
and
when
you
put
it
in
the
context
of
a
specific
provision
where
it
is
not
only
filing
a
complaint,
but
institute
any
proceeding,
caused
any
proceeding
to
be
instituted,
justify
any
proceeding.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
because
a
proceeding
is
understood
and
it's
used
consistently
in
the
flsa
as
an
official
action
by
a
government
agency.
so
no,
i
don't
believe
that
is
instituting
a
proceeding.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
the
oral
doesn't
work
in
that
particular
context.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
--
the
truth
is,
if
the
employer
envisions
in
its
mind
that
it
is
instituting
a
proceeding,
that's
still
not
a
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
what
congress
meant
in
1938.
it
had
in
mind
an
official
action
by
a
government
agency.
and
no
private
employer
is
ever
going
to
institute
a
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
that
particular
scheme.
you
know,
it's
extremely
important
in
the
context
of
this
particular
statute,
and
the
one
thing
i
should
have
answered,
justice
sotomayor,
to
your
question
is,
what's
different
about
this
statute
than
any
other?
this
statute
carries
a
criminal
penalty
with
it.
and
no
other
retaliation
statute
except
for
one--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
but
the
reality
is
that
this
court
held
in
the
cit
case
that
the
court
would
not
construe
this
statute
broadly
in
order
to
expose
people
to
potential
criminal
liabilities.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
--
well,
it
does
have
something
to
do
with
retaliation,
but,
justice
ginsburg,
it
seems
to
me
it's
all
of
a
piece,
though.
because
the
reason
why
you
can
be
comfortable
with
a
willfulness
standard
even
which
extends
to
conscious
disregard
beyond
the
intent
as
well,
but
the
reason
why
you
can
be
comfortable
with
that
is
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
statute
is
crafted
in
terms
of
the
retaliation
provision
itself,
it
speaks
specifically
to
formal
actions
that
are
taken,
the
filing
of
a
complaint,
the
institution
of
a
proceeding.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
believe
--
i
mean,
it's
not
a
null
set,
but
i
don't
believe
it's
a
particularly,
i
don't
think
it's
a
large
number
of
proceedings.
but
it
seems
to
me,
though,
in
trying
to
understand
what
the
congress
of
1938
would
have
done
and
trying
to
understand
why
it
would
have
approached
this
in
a
narrow
way,
and
why
this
provision
is
aimed
not
generally
to
protect
workers,
but
is
aimed
really
to
make
sure
that
information
gets
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
let
me
start
by
saying,
first
of
all,
even
if
the
flsa
has
broadly
a
pro
employee
protective
purpose,
it's
still
important
to
recognize
that
the
retaliation
provision
we
are
talking
about
here
specifically
did
not
provide
a
cause
of
action,
a
private
cause
of
action
until
1977.
so
that
when
congress
enacted
this
statute
in
1938,
it
didn't
say
boo
about
allowing
the
employees
to
show
up
in
court
and
to
assert
their
rights.
this
is
not
part
of
that
expansive,
grant
rights
to
the
employee's
portion
of
this
legislation.
and
then
second,
justice
ginsburg,
with
respect
to
the
specifics
of
what
did
congress
have
in
mind,
it
seems
to
me
the
better
way
to
evaluate
this
is
not
did
congress
have
in
mind
a
group
of
illiterate
employees
or
not,
but
what
language
did
congress
use
in
trying
to
formulate
the
specific
provision
that
gives
rise
to
the
protections
against
retaliation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
will
take
the
former
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
my
guess
is
the
truth
is
they
will
be
able
to
file
oral
complaints
with
the
government
because,
the
only
thing
that
is
left
open
is
the
precise
hypothetical
you
gave,
justice
scalia,
where
you
make
an
oral
complaint
and
nothing
gets
instituted
in
those
circumstances.
and
it
seems
to
me,
clearly,
in
the
federal
government's
authority
to
simply
adopt
a
rule
that
says
any
time
anybody
makes
an
oral
complaint
to
us
we
will
institute
a
proceeding.
and
if
the
agency
adopted
that
view,
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
we
could
do
about
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
--
i
mean,
my
own
view
is
the
better
way
of
reading
--
that
is
a
much
closer
case,
i
will
concede
that,
justice
scalia.
my
own
view
is
that
when
you
talking
about
file
a
complaint,
that
is
just
not
the
way
congress
ordinarily
thinks
about
file
a
complaint.
file
always
has
in
mind
written
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
i'm
not
quarrelling
with
that.
i
mean,
i
understand
that.
and
the
truth
is,
you
know,
i
think
for
another
day
the
issue
will
arise
and
the
court
can
decide
whether
or
not
a
mere
oral
complaint
to
a
government
agency
is
sufficient
to
file
a
complaint
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute.
i
do
think
it
is
fundamentally
important
for
this
court
to
decide
the
underlying
question
of
whether
oral
complaints
are
sufficient
only
in
the
context
in
the
first
instance
of
deciding
whether
or
not
it
has
to
go
to
a
government
agency
as
opposed
to
any
kind
of
private
or
intracorporate
activity.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
terms
of
retaliation,
justice
ginsburg?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
the
vast
majority
of
those
statutes
talk
about
any
action
that
--
opposing
a
practice,
and
therefore
they
deal
with
a
lot
of
intracorporate
activities,
and
obviously
at
some
point
there
is
an
issue
as
to
sort
of
what
the
employer's
intent
is
and
how
far
it
got
up
the
ladder--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
suspect
that
issue
comes
up
almost
every
day,
and
it
is
a
problem;
but
it's
a
problem
that
congress
made
a
judgment
that
we
would
rather
go
ahead
and
allow
those
matters
to
be
litigated;
and
language
that
is
very
expansive
in
protecting
employees
from
retaliation.
and
while
i
--
i
may
chafe
at
that
at
times
as
a
managing
partner
of
a
law
firm,
i
recognize
that
that
is
the
judgment
that
congress
made.
here
we
are
talking
about
a
congress
that
made
a
very
different
judgment
about
how
it
wanted
to
protect
retaliation.
and
it
was
a
judgment
that
was
made,
it
seems
to
me,
very
much
in
the
context
of
1938.
justice
sotomayor,
you
are
very
right;
they
were
not
sure
they
even
had
constitutional
authority
to
be
adopting
this
approach;
and
they
are
attaching
to
it
criminal
sanctions,
and
they
are
not
providing
a
private
right
of
action;
and
in
that
context
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
should
comfortably
say
that
this
is
a
much
narrower
proposition.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
congress
must
have
recognized
that
fact,
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
because
if
under
those
circumstances
when
you're
going
to
impose
criminal
sanctions
on
somebody,
you're
going
to
say
we
are
not
going
to
do
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
i
am
perfectly
comfortable
with
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
--
i
mean,
the
truth
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
want
to
give
up
either
of
the
points,
actually.
but
the
bottom
line
is,
justice
breyer,
the
question
presented
is
--
is
very
broad.
i
mean,
the
question
of
whether
this
goes
to
a
governmental
entity
is
fairly--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
know
that
there's
50
or
60
years
of
allowing
oral
complaints--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
be
in
the
--
in
the
private
context.
there
may
be
50
to
60
years
of
allowing
oral
complaints
being
brought
to
the
government
agency,
which
i
do
think
would
go
to
justice
scalia's
point,
but
with
respect
to
intracorporate
communications
there
is
no
60-year
practice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
would
not
give
any
deference
to
the
government's
position.
certainly
not
chevron
deference
because
this
is
not
a--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean
i
--
yes.
there
is
no
chevron
deference--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
this
is
not
a
matter
that
has
been
allocated
to
either
the
eeoc
or
the
secretary
of
labor
to
administer
and
to
adopt
regulations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
justice
breyer,
that
would
strike
me
as
a
more
persuasive
argument
if
congress
hadn't
--
hadn't
delegated
to
the
secretary
of
labor
specific
rulemaking
authority
with
respect
to
specific
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
and
does
not
have
a
similar
provision
in
connection
with
section
215(a).
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
--
agency
decisionmaking,
but
we
don't
have
that
either.
all
we
have
here
are
certain
enforcement
actions
that
are
being
brought
by
the
agency
and
indeed,
if
you
look
at
the
enforcement
actions,
they
all
ultimately
tie
to
some
official
action
by
some
government
entity.
none
of
the
actions
that
--
that
you
can
go
back
to
say
i
am
going
to
defer
to
this,
go
into
the
circumstance
we
are
talking
about
here,
where
it's
a
purely
private
action
as
opposed
to
some
kind
of
a
public--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
would
give
it
no
weight
at
all.
but
even
if
you
gave
it
weight--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--its
persuasive
weight,
its
persuasive
weight
as
applied
on
a
private
side
is
nonexistent.
you
know,
again,
if
--
if
the
issue
were
before
--
if
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
might
be--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
but
we
don't
have--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
you
don't
have
anywhere
near
the
50
years
of
practice
dealing
with
the
specific
hypothetical
you
posed,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
i
don't
think
that's
the
most
natural
way--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
read
this
statute.
and
i
think
the
right
way
to
read
the
statute
is
to
either
say--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
a
--
that
an
oral
complaint
is
--
is
not
sufficient,
but
if
--
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to
decide
that
issue.
i
think
the
better
way
to
decide
this
case
and
the
more
fundamental
one;
it
is
the
one
justice
scalia
was
coming
back
to,
is
does
it
apply
beyond
the
government
agency
context?
and
if
that
isn't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
wasn't
brought
up
specifically
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
clearly
presented
and
decided
by
the
seventh
circuit,
so
it
was
in
the
case
as
it
came
to
this
court;
and
this
court's
rule
is
that
you
can
defend
the
judgment
on
any
ground
that's
fairly
presented.
and
--
and
this
ground
seems
to
me
more
than
fairly
presented,
since
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
--
yes
--
if
you
go
back
to
the
legislative
history
there
is
a
colloquy
between
the
two
senators,
and
i
recognize
some
members
of
the
court
are
unenthusiastic
--
but
--
but
you
know,
in
that
colloquy,
they
talk
about
malicious
complaints,
and
it
seems
to
me
malicious
in
that
context
is
talking
about
where
you
have
essentially
defamed
your
employer
through
a
government
agency.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
if
you
are
going
back
and
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
congress
of
1938
had
in
mind,
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
to
look
at
the
language
chosen
and
the
company
that
that
language
keeps.
and
when
you
take
about
filing
a
complaint
and
you
file
a
--
you
talk
about
instituting
a
proceeding
or
causing
a
proceeding
to
be
instituted,
or
testifying
at
a
proceeding
that's
formal,
or
belonging
to
a
--
to
a
company
committee
that
is
again,
a
governmentally
instituted
methodology,
the
best
way
to
read
that
is
to
say
what
they
have
in
mind
is
an
official
government
action
of
some
sort.
and
it
makes
perfect--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
it
is
tied
to
this.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
have
no
doubt
that
an
employee
under
those
circumstances
if
--
if
discharged
would
be
able
to
make
a
claim
under
title
vii
of
retaliation
for
that
particular
conduct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
i
--
i
think
the
key
to
this
process,
justice
ginsburg,
is
what
lens
you
are
looking
at.
are
you
looking
through
the
cracked
and
yellowed
glass
that
i
am
looking
through
from
1938,
or
the
glass
as
it
looks
through
in
2010,
and
the
truth
is
if
you
were
going
to
adopt--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
--
but
the
--
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1938,
and
it
was
enacted
as
fairly
radical
and
made
an
--
an
initial
incursion
from
protecting
people
from
rehabilitation.
it
doesn't
purport
to
be
as
expansive
as
any
of
the
subsequent
--
and
the
truth
is
--
can
i
make
this
point?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
since
the
federal
arbitration
act
--
well,
it
actually
probably
predates
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
it
would
have
been
back
around
the
same
period
of
time,
in
the
1930s.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
don't
--
i
believe
that
proceeding
is
used
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
consistently
throughout
the
statute
to
talk
about
government
--
official
government
actions
and
not
simply--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
nothing.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
that
--
in
the
brief
we
identified
a
number
of
places
where
congress
uses
the
word
"proceedings",
and
every
place
where
they
use
the
word
"proceedings"
they
have
in
mind
an
official
government
activity.
and
so
i
think
it
is
the
most
reasonable
--
logical
way
to
read
this
particular
language
as
incorporating
that.
of
course,
even
if
that
were
true,
even
if
you
would
preserve
that,
that
still
wouldn't
be
a
basis
for
going
forward
with
this
case,
because
there
was
no
proceeding
that
was
instituted
pursuant
to
the
informal
actions
that
were
taken.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
understand
that,
but
i'm--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
do
not
believe
they
would
have
regarded
that
as
retaliatory
under
the
statute
because
of
the
fact
that
the
way
this
is
all
set
up
is
the
--
and
the
--
it's
just
the
narrowness
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and,
justice
ginsburg,
to
your
question
about
the
subsequent
legislation
that
has
all
been
enacted,
it
seems
to
me
in
a
lot
of
ways
that
that
reinforces
the
core
interpretive
approach
that
i
have
taken
in
this
case,
because
if
it
were
absolutely
clear
that
the
language
about
filing
a
complaint
and
instituting
a
proceeding
were
as
broad
as
--
certainly
as
the
petitioner
proposes
in
this
case,
where
any
kind
of
oral
grumbling
is
sufficient,
congress
never
would
have
needed
to
deviate
from
that
template
and
all
the
legislation
that
came
afterwards.
and
there
are
tons
of
statutes
that
say:
file
a
complaint,
institute
a
proceeding,
and
otherwise
oppose.
and
there
would
have
been
no
reason
for
congress
to
do
that
if
this
language
would
have
accomplished
precisely
the
same
thing.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'm
sure
there
are
such
cases,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
doubt
--
it
probably
wouldn't
come
up
so
much
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
process.
and
that's
the
problem:
this
has
got
a
fairly
narrow
sweep
to
it.
obviously,
wage
and
hours
is
not
a
significant
activity,
but
it
doesn't
tend
to
generate
the
same
kind
of
intensity
that
you
might
expect
out
of
title
vii
or
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
or
some
of
the
other
provisions.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honors,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
intuitively,
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg,
but
we
have
to
go,
again:
what
was
the
purpose
of
this
particular
statute?
and
this
statute
was
not
intended
as
a
protection
to
the
employer
or
to
the
employee
--
or
to
the
employer.
this
was
a
provision
that
was
designed
to
give
information
to
the
federal
government.
and
we
know
that
because
there's
no
private
right
of
action
to
the
employee
that
it
is
enforceable
as
a
criminal
sanction.
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
precursors
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
--
and
somebody
asked;
this
was
the
first
one.
i
gathered
there
was
a
third
one.
there
was
the
railway
labor
act,
the
nlra,
and
then
there
was
this
particular
provision.
but
if
you
go
back
to
these
precursors,
you
see
that
it's,
again,
a
very
narrow
approach
that
was
taken
under
those
statutes
as
well.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
part
of
it
depends
on
whether
the
fair
labor
standards
act
applies
to
federal
employees.
there
is
a
whole
separate
regime
that
deals
with
federal
employees.
and
i
can't
--
i'm
not
100
percent
sure
whether
this
provision
applies
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
your
honor.
