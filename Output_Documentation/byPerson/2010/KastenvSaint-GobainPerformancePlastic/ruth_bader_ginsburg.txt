justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
wasn't
--
he
didn't
invoke
the
grievance
procedure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case,
he
didn't
invoke
the
grievance
procedure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
would
keep
you
out,
if
that
were
the
test,
that
you
have
to
formally
invoke
the
grievance
procedure.
but
we
are
told
that
every
other
time
the
word
"file"
is
used
in
this
act,
fair
labor
standards
act,
it
refers
to
a
writing.
and
so
you
are
urging
a
meaning
that
deviates
from
the
standard
meaning
of
the
term
in
the
very
act
at
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
another
provision
where
the
word
file
is
used
to
mean
something
other
than
a
writing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
--
you
--
are
you
urging
that
if
you
just
tell
a
coworker,
that
that's
enough?
i
thought
the
whole
idea
is
to
give
the
employer
notice
that
something
is
amiss.
so,
how
would
telling
a
coworker
serve
that
purpose?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
did
he
do?
what
did
he
do
specifically?
i
mean,
you
are
saying
that
--
that
the
employer
has
to
know
that
he
is
making
a
complaint
under
the
act.
so
what
--
and
you
said
here
are
the
facts
that
was
clear
that
he
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
a
protection
built
in,
mr.
phillips,
it
says
it's
criminal
liability
only
if
it's
willful.
and
on
the
civil
side,
the
civil
liability
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
you
certainly
don't
have
to
prove
willful,
you
just
prove
a
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is
whether
the
violation
is
willful.
the
willful
qualification
in
the
criminal
context
is
are
you
willfully
denying
your
workers
the
wages
and
hours
the
statute
requires?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nothing
to
do
with
retaliation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know,
how
common
is
it
to
have
criminal
prosecutions
under
this
section
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
whole
idea
of
this
statute
is
to
protect
the
workers,
and
i
would
like
you
to
address
particularly
the
amici's
point,
that
this
statute
in
1938
affected
people
--
many
were
illiterate,
they
couldn't
write
a
complaint,
many
were
immigrants
who
weren't
familiar
with
the
language,
for
that
universe
of
people,
wouldn't
congress
have
meant
that
all
complaints
are
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
work
with
respect
to
the
more
recent
statutes?
title
vii,
the
age
discrimination
act,
disabilities
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
if
you
have
not
filed
anything
with
the
government,
but
you
have
to
your
supervisor
opposed
a
practice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
it
--
so
in
those
cases
i
think
you
are
quite
right,
intracorporate
complaints
count
as
opposing
any
practice.
has
there
been
any
huge
problems
about
people
saying,
oh,
i
made
an
oral
complaint
to
my
supervisor,
and
supervisor
said
i
never
heard
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
isn't
even
brought
up
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
right?
it
--
it's
in
your
brief
on
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
it
--
how
would
it
relate
to,
say,
an
equal
pay
complaint?
because
equal
pay
is
formally
part
of
the
fair--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--labor
standards
act.
but
an
equal
pay
complaint
could
also
be
brought
as
a
title
vii
suit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
a
--
a
worker
just
complains
about
the
denial
of
equal
pay
to
the
supervisor.
does
that
--
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
there's
been
--
you
said
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
government
for
60
years
--
but
there
has
been
some
30
years
or
more
experience
under
title
vii
of
the
statutes,
with
oral
complaints
to
the
employer
as
being
sufficient
to
ground
a
retaliation
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
really
--
it
starts
in
1970.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
starts
in
the
1970s.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
one
more
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
to
me
you
are
saying
the
only
complaint
that
counts
is
the
one
to
the
government.
isn't
--
in
the
work
setting
that's
being
regulated,
wouldn't
there
be
every
reason
to
want
the
employee
to
complain
first
to
the
employer
rather
than
making
a
federal
case
out
of
it
by
complaining
to
a
government
agency?
