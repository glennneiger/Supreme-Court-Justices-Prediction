we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-834,
kasten
v.
saint-gobain
performance
plastics
corporation.
mr.
kaster.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
wall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
he
just
says
to
the
employer,
"you
know,
i
think
we
ought
to
have
a
little
more
time
to
put
on
our
gear.
"
is
that
an
assertion
of
statutory
rights
under
the
flsa?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
know,
but
the
idea
--
one
of
the
objections
to
your
position
is
that
it's
going
to
be
very
hard
to
figure
out
in
any
particular
case
what
is
a
filing
an
oral
complaint
under
the
flsa,
because
one,
it's
got
to
be
reconstructed,
unlike
the
situation
where
you
had
have
a
government
agency
that's
doing
it,
or
you
have
a
written
complaint;
and
second
of
all,
it's
--
it's
unclear
perhaps
for
the
employer
to
know
that
he's
being
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
flsa.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it's
written
--
if
it's
written,
you
have
got
a
document
that
people
can
look
like
--
look
at,
whether
it's
the
nlrb
or
a
court,
that
--
that
they
can
look
at
and
say,
yes,
this
is
a
--
an
assertion
of
a
violation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
he
goes
to
the
boss
and
says,
boss,
you
ought
to
do
something,
that
railing
is
--
is
pretty
dangerous
over
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
the
boss
supposed
to
know,
well,
he
is
asserting
statutory
rights
under
the
flsa?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
not
be
filing
a
complaint?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
wall,
i
--
this
is
just
a
factual.
were
you
saying
that
the
employee
has
to
know
that
he
is
submitting
a
claim
of
statutory
violation
or
the
employer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.

scalia's
hypothetical,
unless
i
am
misremembering,
i
think,
is
very
common.
for
example,
the
eeoc,
people
often
file
complaints
and
then
the
eeoc
considers
whether
it's
going
to
institute
a
proceeding
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
are
an
employee
of
the
treasury
department
and
there
is
an
oral
complaint
to
your
superior?
is
that
filing
a
complaint
with
the
government?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kaster,
you
have
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
