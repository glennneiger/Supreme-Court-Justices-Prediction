justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
give
you
this
example.
suppose
a
company
has
an
established
policy
that
if
you
want
to
make
a
complaint,
there's
a
particular
supervisor
you
should
go
to.
and
let's
say
they
say
you
can
make
this
complaint
in
writing,
you
can
make
it
orally.
now,
there's
--
something's
going
on
in
the
workplace
and
the
supervisor
happens
to
be
walking
by,
maybe
a
machine
is
broken,
an
employee
has
been
hurt,
and
an
employee
walks
up
to
the
supervisor
who
is
walking
briskly
by,
taps
the
supervisor
on
the
shoulder
and
says
the
company
is
violating
the
fair
labor
standards
act
because
of
the
placement
of
a
clock.
you
said
that
filing
has
no
formality
requirement.
would
that
be
the
filing
of
a
complaint?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
filing
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
something
is
written,
although
that's
usually
what
the
word
means,
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
filing
your
comments
right
now?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
are?
really?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
the
ordinary
usage
of
the
word.
but
to
say
that
it
includes
no
degree
of
formality,
that's
your
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
that's
the
law
and
the
employee
gets
fired
and
the
employee
says,
well,
this
was
done
in
retaliation
for
my
having
filed
an
fsla
complaint
three
weeks
ago,
and
the
employer
says
what
complaint?
we
have
no
record
of
any
such
complaint
and
the
employee
says,
oh,
yes,
i
said
it
orally
to
a
supervisor
who
was
passing
by
and
my
buddy
joe
was
there
and
he's
going
to
corroborate
this.
so
now
we
have
a
trial
about
whether
a
complaint
was
filed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
with
whom?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
would
really
be
helpful
if
you
could
just
give
us
the
rule
that
you
think
should
apply.
is
the
rule
--
your
--
your
--
mr.
kaster's
argument
seems
to
be
anything
goes,
any
oral
communication
to
a
supervisor
goes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
go
back
to
the
example
i
started
out
with.
a
worker
has
been
hurt,
a
supervisor
is
going
to
attend
to
the
hurt
worker,
and
an
employee
says,
the
company
is
violating
the
flsa.
and
the
supervisor
says,
don't
tell
me,
and
don't
tell
me
about
it
now.
i'm
doing
something
else.
that's
enough?
