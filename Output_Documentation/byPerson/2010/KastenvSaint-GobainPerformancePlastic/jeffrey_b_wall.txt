mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
number
of
the
court's
questions
are
focusing
on
some
of
the
practical
difficulties
here.
the
government
wants
to
start
by
pointing
out
there
are
a
number
of
statutes,
20
or
more,
that
have
similar
anti-retaliation
provisions.
most
of
those
statutes
cover
all
the
complaints,
either
because
congress
has
said
so
in
administering,
agencies
have
said
so
or
the
courts
have
said
so.
and
the
kind
of
practical
difficulties
that
the
court
is
raising
have
not
proven
unworkable
under
any
statutory
schemes.
the
respondent
can't
point
to
a
single
other
statute
addressing
these
kinds
--
this
labor
context
that
has
been
narrowed
--
excuse
me
--
to
cover
only
oral
complaints.
what
we're--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--yes.
i
mean,
it--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
it's
not
the
older.
it
was
model
on
the
nlra,
which
is
even
older.
for
instance,
the
nlrb
has
found
that
if,
you
know,
employees
are
complaining
to
each
other,
that
they
can't
be
discharged
under
the
nlra's
anti-retaliation
provision,
or
if
an
employee
orally
says
to
his
employer,
i'm
about
to
go
to
the
board
and
tell
them
you
are
doing
something
unlawful,
the
board
has
said
you
can't
be
discharged.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
the
language
in
the
nlra
is
"file
charges"
or
"give
testimony".
so,
instead
of
filing
a
complaint,
it
says
"file
charges".
but
the
language
in
many
of
these
statutes,
and
they
are
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs,
is
extremely
similar.
they
refer
to
filing
complaints
or
charges,
instituting
proceedings.
as
you
pointed--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--it
wouldn't
under
this
particular
statute,
justice
ginsburg.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
under
the
flsa.
the
flsa
anti-retaliation
provision
does
not
have
an
opposing
any
practice
clause
in
the
way
that
some
civil
rights
statutes
do
like
title
vii.
so,
it
does
require
submission
of
a
complaint
to
an
employer,
but
that
could
take
many
forms.
and
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
scalia,
in
this
particular
context,
filing
something
orally
makes
perfect
sense.
we
are
not
--
we
are
talking
about
the
kinds
of
industries,
truck
drivers,
coal
miners
and
migrant
workers
where
that's
a
perfectly
normal
use
of
speech.
oral
communication--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
the
government
has
any
objection
to
that
standard.
although
i
do
think--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
--
i
think
the
kind
of
indicia
or
formality
you
are
talking
about
are
signs
that
the
employer
has
submitted
to
his
employer
an
assertion
of
statutory
rights
under
the
flsa.
i
think
those
are
the
two
things
that
the
lower
courts
have
consistently
looked
to.
and
i
think
those
indicia
of
formality
are
a
good
sign
that
the
employer
has,
but
they
are
not
the
only
sign.
if
i
walk
into
the
happy
hour
and
i
have
actually
written
down
on
a
form
that
my
employer
promulgates
and
i
hand
it
off
to
my
supervisor--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--that
the
employer
has
--
the
employee
has
indicated
to
his
employer,
someone
in
supervisory
authority,
that
he
is
asserting
statutory
rights
under
the
flsa.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that's
a
difficult
question.
i
don't
think
it
is
presented
here,
because
this
isn't
a
content
case.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
but
that
question
comes
up
in
every
case,
whether
the
complaint
is
written
or
oral
to
the
government
or
an
employer.
if
i
write
down--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--if
i
write
down
on
a
form
promulgated
by
my
employer
i
don't
like
where
the
time
clocks
are
or
i
think
the
time--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
breyer,
i'm
sorry
if
--
if
--
if
it
the
formulation
i
have
given
you
is
not
helpful,
but
in
--
in
these
statutes
where
either
by
expressed
language
or
regulation,
so
for
instance,
the
surface
transportation
assistance
act,
and
ada
or
osha,
the
--
the
language
varies
from
regulation
to
regulation.
in
some
of
them
it
says
lodge
complaints,
and
some
of
them
it
says
make
a
complaint.
but
what
the
courts
have--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--again
--
and
agencies
have
put
these
in
writing,
so
at
footnote
6
on
page,
i
think
it's
16
of
the
government's
brief,
we
have
the
osha
regulations.
the
staa
regulations
appear
at
page,
i
think
it's
21--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
think
the
test,
justice
alito,
is
whether
the
employee
has
submitted
a
complaint
to
his
employer
that
has
put
the
employer
on
notice
that
that
employee
is
asserting
statutory
rights
under
the
flsa,
claiming
that
he
is
legally
entitled
to
something
he
is
not
receiving.
if
the
supervisor
walks
in
the
next
morning
and
says
to
his
boss,
yesterday
morning
while
i
was
attending
to
the
plant
accident,
joe
told
me
that
the
time
clocks
are
in
the
wrong
place.
he's
about
to
file.
i
think
we
need
to
fire
him,
he's
a
troublemaker.
that
employee
has
stated
a
claim
to
the
flsa.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
again--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
there
probably
not.
the
employee--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
mean,
i
think
as
a
content
case,
which
it
is
not,
it's
unlikely
that
that
is.
saying
that
you
don't
like
something
or
you
think
it
is
unsafe
is
not
actually
saying
you
have
are
asserting
a
right
to
have
it
differently.
but
those
are
content
cases.
and
here
there
is
no
question
the
petitioner
asserted
his
statutory
rights
to
a
number
of
different
people
at
the
company.
what
respondent
is
saying
is
he
didn't
do
it
the
right
way.
if
he
had
done
exactly
what
he
did
in
exactly
the
same
words,
but
he
had
done
it
some
other
way,
then
it
would
be
covered.
so,
this
is
a
form
case.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
if
you
credit
his
allegations,
which
you
have
to
at
this
point,
because
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
on
a
legal
ground,
what
petitioner
says
he
did
is
he
went
to
his
supervisor.
he
said
the
time
clocks
are
in
the
wrong
place.
we
are
not
getting
paid
for
all
of
our
time.
and
then
he
went
up
the
ladder
to
human
resources
personnel
at
the
company,
and
he
said
exactly
the
same
thing,
and
he
said
i
thinking
about
challenging
you
on
it
in
court,
and
if
i
challenge
you,
you
will
lose.
now,
whatever
the
test
is,
that
clearly
meets
the
bar
for
asserting
statutory
rights
under
the
flsa.
and
i
think
what
is
important
to
not
is
that
this
court
has
consistently,
from
the
1940s
on,
both
with
respect
to
the
flsa
and
anti-retaliation
provisions
more
generally
in
title
vii
and
other
statutes,
it
has
always
given
them
a
broader
reading
to
effectuate
their
purposes.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think
what
the
lower
courts
have
said,
and
i
think
this
makes
sense,
is
that
the
question
of
whether
a
reasonable,
objective
person
would
have
understood
the
employee
to
have
submitted
a
claim
complaint.
so
if
the
employee
does
everything
he
can
to
put
the
employer
on
notice,
it's
not
a
defense
for
the
employer
to
say
that
subjectively
he
didn't
understand
it
to
be
a
complaint.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
can't,
justice
kennedy.
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
the
vast
majority
of
circuits
have
found
that
intracompany
complaints
are
protected
and--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--thank
you.
mr.
phillips?
