well,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
question--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
question
justice
scalia
filed
just
earlier.
[laughter]
what
--
what
would
you
say
about
his
point
that
it
seems
to
me
had
substantial
merit?
it
--
it's
really
our
determination
--
our
interpretation
of
what
filing
means
might
well
depend
on
whether
filing
in
--
or
a
complaint
includes
intracompany
complaints,
the
grumbling
of
an
employee
and
so
forth;
and
i
recognize
this
--
this
argument
comes
up
late.
has
it
been
addressed
in
any
of
the
other
circuits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
have
said
that
intracompany
complaints--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
those
circuits
where
they
allow
intercompany
complaints
that
are
oral,
can
you
give
me
any
sense
of
how
often
this
leads
to
claim
for
retaliation?
i
mean,
are
they
in
the
hundreds
or.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
more
of
a
question
for
the
petitioner's
counsel
than
you,
but
are
you
aware
of
any
cases
in
any
other
jurisdictions
where
there
have
been
proceedings,
actions
for
retaliation,
based
on
complaints
to
third
parties,
like
complaining
to
the
press?
