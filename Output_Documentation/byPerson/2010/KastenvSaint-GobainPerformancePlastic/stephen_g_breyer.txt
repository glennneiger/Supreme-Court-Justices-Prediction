justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
you
feel
the
need
to
go
beyond,
say,
what
the
afl-cio
identifies
as
a
normal
oral
failing
--
filing?
they
use
language
like,
at
the
initial
stage
of
the
grievance
procedure,
there
is
confrontation
with
an
eye
to
fact
finding,
and
the
dispute
is
joined
when
the
employee
or
the
steward
or
supervisor
come
face-to-face
to
identify,
to
discuss,
and
hopefully
to
resolve
a
problem.
now
that's
a
formal
kind
of
relationship.
it
doesn't
involve
a
cocktail
party,
and
yet
it
is
done
orally.
and
there
is
a
tradition
as
to
how
that
works.
but
from
you've
said,
i
gather
that
you
want
to
go
well
beyond
that
and
provide
that
cocktail
parties
--
perhaps
not
cocktail
parties,
but
just
a
tap
on
the
shoulder
would
be
sufficient,
where
i
take
it
that
would
normally
be
sufficient
in
the
grievance
process.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
suppose
i
think
that
that
provides
a
good
precedent
for
--
for
oral
filings.
what
happens
then?
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
in
your
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
we
are
talking
about
a
filing.
in
the
grievance
process
--
i
don't
want
to
repeat
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
form
having
read
the
brief
that
filing
takes
place
without
writing,
provided
that
there
are
these
other
safeguards
which
are
described.
now,
i
want
to
know
in
your
opinion,
is
there
a
reason
for
not
importing
that
into
this
system?
i
take
it
you
win
the
case
--
or
maybe
you
lose
it,
i
don't
know
how
it
works
on
the
fact.
i
don't
know
what
the
filing
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
a
word
"filing"
in
the
afl-cio
statute
as
well.
so
i
am
looking
for
a
way
of
interpreting
the
one
in
light
of
the
other.
do
you
favor
that?
are
you
against
that?
if
so,
why
or
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
fine.
it's
a
perfectly
normal
use
of
speech,
i
accept
that.
but
what
is
it
that
would
surround
this
use
of
speech
on
a
particular
occasion
with
enough
formality
that
we
know
it
isn't
something
that
could
pass
unnoticed
and
bring
in
a
whole
lot
of
things
like
the
cocktail
party
example,
et
cetera?
i
noticed
there
was
a
paragraph
in
the
afl-cio
--
that's
why
i
brought
it
up.
is
that
the
right
standard?
what
we
say
here
may
take
effect
or
have
influence,
so
--
so
i
want
to
say
it
correctly.
what
kinds
of
oral
complaints
count
as
filing
a
complaint?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
would
like
more
than
that.
the
government
sees
these
statutes
as
a
whole,
so
i
would
like
the
government's
assistance
on
what
words
to
write
to
be
able
to
get
this
right
so
it
will
not
be
too
formal,
it
will
not
be
too
informal,
it
will
do
the
job.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
fill
in
this
blank
then,
there
must
be
surrounding
the
oral
complaint
sufficient
elements
of
formality
such
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
it's
on
a
form.
so
we
have
got
that
--
that
helps
a
lot.
also
an
employer
could
have
a
notice.
notice,
if
you
really
are
upset
because
you
think
there
is
a
violation
going
here,
go
to
this
microphone
which
is
directly
connected
to
the
complaint
department
and
cite
the
statute.
that
would
work,
too.
[laughter]
but
--
but
there
have
been
years
and
years
of
--
you
have
just
said,
of
statutes
like
this,
you
say
that
many
of
them
operate
orally.
all
right.
what
kind
of
thing,
if
you
can
help,
maybe
you
can't
--
which
is
dangerous,
but
then
we
just
try
to
do
our
best,
and
we
don't
have
the
labor
law
experience
necessarily,
but
--
but
what
is
the
--
the
form
of
words
that
we
can
use
to
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
see
if
i
can
look,
because
in
about
2
minutes
you
are
going
to
hear,
i
suspect
and
the
other
side,
say
see,
see,
we
told
you,
that's
why
you
have
to
have
it
in
writing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
justice
ginsburg's
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
her
question?
in
1938
a
lot
of
illiterate
people
couldn't
have
filed
written
complaints.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
they
did,
isn't
it
reasonable
to
think
that
they
would
have
included
in
filing,
in
such
circumstances,
oral
filing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
that
--
your
problem
is
--
that
in
front
of
us,
do
we
have
to
decide
that
now?
we've
granted
a
different
question,
etc.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
may
not
want
to
give
up
your
first
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
then
it's
odd
that
you
say
--
it
--
i
gather,
as
well,
for
about
50
or
60
years
the
relevant
agencies
have
interpreted
the
--
the
statute
the
way
that
--
to
include
oral
complaints.
and
that
seems
to
me
a
fairly
strong
reason
for
continuing
to
do
so,
if
--
where
the
language
is
so
--
allows
it
and
there
aren't
any
strong
reasons
the
other
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
it's
30
years.
maybe
it's
30.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
chevron
deference
would
depend
on
an
intent.
i
guess
you
are
getting
into
an
argument
here
that
there's
no
reason
to
repeat
in
public.
i
mean,
justice
scalia
and
i
don't
necessarily
agree
on
this.
why
would
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
know?
i
mean,
all
right,
if
you
want
to
get
into
it,
this
is
a
very
minor
sort
of
interstitial
point
in
a
statute
that
they
administer,
and
there
are
lots
of
instances,
i
think
where
the
court
has
said,
where
these
minor
matters
of
how
you
work
out
the
actual
application
of
the
word
are
implicitly
delegate
it
to
the
agency
to
determine
within
the
context
of
reasonable
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
not
everything
has
to
be
done
through
formal
rules.
there
--
there
are
many,
many
ways
of
agencies
determining
practice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
why
would
it
be
different?
if
an
agency
work
out
a
system
of
deciding
when
a
person
is
really
making
a
complaint,
as
opposed
to
an
offhand
remark,
and
that
is
good
enough
to
run
the
government
of
the
united
states,
where
they
have
--
where
they
are
in
this
business,
why
--
why
couldn't
whatever
their
indicia
are
there,
also
be
transplanted
to
the
private
sector--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
get
that
to
work
out
all
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
which
case
you
would
be
left,
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
might
work,
then
--
the
you
are
left
with
the
simple
argument
that
you
don't
think
that
this
statute
means
to
apply
to
complaints
to
an
employer,
written
or
oral?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
accept
--
you
think
--
that
a
tenable
interpretation?
what
this
means
is
that
written
complaints
are
good
enough
to
count
as
filings
where
you
complained
to
your
private
employer,
but
written
or
oral
count
as
a
filing
where
you
deal
to
--
with
the
government
agency?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
agree
with
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the
ground
itself,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
that
says
it's
limited
to
the
government?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
could
be.
it
could
be
that
they
are
thinking
of
malicious
complaints
and
they
are
thinking
of
government
agencies
at
the
time,
but
neither
their
language
nor
their
purpose,
as
history
later
shows,
requires
that
limitation
on
scope.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
fair
labor
standards
act
of
1938
prohibits
employers
from
discharging
or
discriminating
against
an
employee
because
that
employee
has
“filed
any
complaint”
related
to
the
act.
now,
the
petitioner
here
kevin
kasten,
complained
to
his
supervisor
at
work
about
what
he
saw
as
a
violation
of
the
act's
provisions
governing
working
hours
and
later
he
was
dismissed.
and
he
says
that
was
in
retaliation
for
having
made
that
complaint.
the
question
before
us
here
is
whether
the
phrase
"filed
any
complaint"
applies
to
an
employee
who
like
petitioner
kasten
made
a
complaint
about
a
violation
of
the
act
but
made
that
complain
orally
rather
than
in
writing.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
phrase
"filed
any
complaint"
applies
to
and
protects
only
those
who
filed
there
complaints
in
writing.
we
do
not
agree.
the
word
file
does
sometimes
refer
to
a
writing
but
sometimes
it
does
not.
and
there
are
two
important
considerations
here
that
are
you
in
favor
of
the
broader
interpretation.
first,
the
act
was
passed
in
the
1930s
to
protect
the
poorest
of
workers
limiting
its
anti-retaliation
provision
to
written
complaints
would
undercut
protection
for
those
such
as
illiterate
workers
who
need
it
the
most.
second,
the
secretary
of
labor
and
the
eeoc
have
long
taken
the
position
that
the
provision
protects
oral
complaints
and
we
were
deferred
to
the
reasonable
views
of
those
agencies.
this
is
not
to
say
that
a
worker
can
invoke
the
protections
of
the
acts
simply
by
going
around
complaining.
rather
the
statutory
text
"filed
any
complaint"
does
contemplate
a
degree
of
formality
certainly
to
the
point
where
the
employer,
the
recipient,
has
been
given
fair
notice
that
a
grievance
about
illegal
conditions
as
at
issue,
it
has
been
lodged
and
he
should
reasonably
understand
that
that's
meant
to
be
a
serious
business
concern.
saint-gobain
makes
the
additional
claim
that
it
should
win
because
the
act
protects
only
complaints
made
to
the
government
and
not
as
here
simply
to
a
supervisor
in
a
private
firm.
because
this
argument
was
not
properly
preserved
however,
we
do
not
consider
it.
for
these
reasons
and
those
given
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit
and
we
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
scalia
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joins
in
part.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
