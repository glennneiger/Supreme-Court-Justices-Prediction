mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
chief
justice's
question
suggests,
although
stanford
and
the
government's
interests
are
aligned
in
this
case,
that
won't
invariably
be
so,
and
the
government
has
perhaps
different
reasons
for
supporting
the
same
position
that
stanford
is
supporting.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
government-wide
regulation
that
--
which
was
promulgated
by
the
department
of
commerce
and
which
identifies
certain
things
that
should
be
in
the
funding
agreements,
it
does
not
require
an
assignment
of
title
from
the
university's
employees.
the
regulation
does
require
the
university
to
make
assurance
--
give
assurances
that
it
has
contractual
obligations
from
its
employees
to
cooperate
in
filing
the
documents
necessary
to
process
a
completed
patent
application.
but
that
would
be
necessary--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
under
our
theory
--
first,
under
our
theory
it
wouldn't
be
necessary,
because
the
statute
itself
would
give
the
university
title.
and
second,
under
respondent's
theory
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
doubt
whether
it
would
be
permissible.
that
is,
respondent's
vision
of
the
bayh-dole
act
is
that
congress
imposed
elaborate
requirements
on
inventions
as
to
which
the
contractor
has
obtained
title
from
the
researcher,
but
that
congress
left
entirely
to
private
ordering,
was
indifferent
as
to
whether
the
contractor
took
title
in
the
first
instance.
and
if
that
view
of
the
statute
were
accepted,
there
would
at
least
be
a
substantial
doubt
whether
the
commerce
department
could
promulgate
regulations
that
would
validly
require
the
contractor
to
do
something
that,
in
respondent's
view,
congress
left
to
private
ordering.
now,
i
don't
want
to
argue
that
point
too
vigorously,
because
certainly,
if
this
court
holds
that
assignments
from
the
inventors
are
required,
we
would
like
to
have
the
opportunity
to
require
the
contractor
to
get
them,
but
it
isn't
clear
to
me
how
you
would
get
there
if
respondent's
view
of
the
statute
were
accepted.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
would
certainly
like
to
have
the
opportunity
to
do
that,
but
to
use
an
analogy,
the
bayh-dole
act
is
triggered
by
voluntary
choices
of
small
businesses
and
nonprofits
to
accept
federal
funds.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if
--
certainly
if
this
court,
as
i
say,
holds
that
the
--
an
assignment
from
the
inventor
is
required,
then
we
would
like
to
be
able
to
have
regulations
that
would
require
that
to
be
done.
as
i
say--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
typically
it
would
--
it
would
certainly
have
to
identify
the
inventors
on
the
patent
application,
and
typically
the
university
would
--
whether
it
felt
an
assignment
was
legally
required
or
not,
it
would
attempt
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--not
--
in
most
cases,
but
not
necessarily.
there's
a
provision
of
the
patent
act,
35
u.s.c.
118,
which
says
that
if
an
inventor
refuses
to
execute
an
assignment
or
cannot
be
found
after
reasonable
diligence,
a
person
to
whom
the
patent
application
has
been
assigned
or
to
whom
the
inventor
has
promised
to
assign
it,
or
some
other
person
with
a
sufficient
proprietary
interest
in
the
invention,
can
file
its
own
patent
application.
it
will
identify
the
inventor
as
the
inventor,
and
it
will
provide
documentation
that
establishes
its
own
interest
in
the
invention.
and
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
we
might
in
some
instances
have
to
do
with
respect
to
federal
employees.
that
is,
there's
an
executive
order
that
says
basically
as
a
condition
of
federal
employment,
if
you
conceive
--
if
you
create
or
conceive
an
invention
on
the
job,
it
--
the
federal
government
is
entitled
to
take
title
to
it.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
could
be
a
--
i
mean,
there
are
two
different
things.
it
could
be
a
promise
to
assign
at
the
formation
of
the
employment
arrangement,
where
the
employee
is
not
--
doesn't
necessarily
have
in
mind
any
particular
invention,
but
he
exercises
a
contractual
commitment
to
assign
to
the
--
to
the
employer
at
a
later
date.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
he
agreed
to
that,
and
he
also
agreed
that
he
would
not
enter
into
any
other
arrangement
that
placed
him
in
conflict
with
the
agreement
he
had
made--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--leaving
aside
the
question
of
whether
that
is
right
or
wrong
is
a
matter
of
contract
law,
our
view
is
it
was
not
within
stanford's
power
to
essentially
convey
to
the
inventor
or
allow
the
inventor
to
retain
title,
and
that's
clear
in
a
couple
of
different
respects.
the
provision
that
mr.
ayer
was
reading,
section
202(d),
says
that
if
the
contractor
does
not
elect
to
retain
title,
then
the
inventor
can
make
a
request
for
retention
of
title,
which
the
agency
will
consider
after
consultation
with
the
contractor.
so
the
statute
doesn't
say
to
the
contractor--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
--
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
the
agreement
made
with
stanford
took
precedence
over
the
contractual
commitment
to
cetus,
based
either
on
general
contract
law
or
on
the
view
that
bayh-dole
would
prohibit
the
enforcement
of
the
--
of
the
agreement
with
cetus
under
these
circumstances,
that
would
satisfactorily
resolve
the
case
from
the
government's
perspective.
the
one--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
there
are
probably
a
lot
of
universities
that
use
this
language,
and
indeed,
as
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
points
out,
it's
very
natural
to
distinguish
between
a
present
assignment
and
a
promise
to
assign
in
the
future
with
respect
to
an
invention
that
now
exists.
it
seems
a
little
ethereal
to
distinguish
between
a
present
assignment
of
an
invention
that
has
not
yet
been
created
and
an
agreement
to
assign
that
in
the
future.
now,
certainly
universities
could
change
their
contracts
if
that
was
what
was
necessary.
i
think
one
of
the
concerns
that
the
government
has,
and
this
was
hinted
at
by
the
chief
justice's
question,
is
that
we're
--
we're
worried
not
just
about
what
can
be
done
to
universities,
but
what
universities
could
do
to
us.
that
is,
it's
standard
university
practice
to
say
employees
agree
to
assign
their
inventions
to
the
university,
and
the
two
parties
will
divide
the
royalties;
and
if
that
is
done,
then
even
under
respondent's
view
it
becomes
a
subject
invention;
and
the
university's
commercialization
of
the
invention
is
subject
to
all
the
requirements
of
bayh-dole.
the
government--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
--
the
nih
document
is
internally
inconsistent,
because
it
says
at
the
beginning
that
title
passes
automatically
to
the
university,
but
then,
as
you
say,
it
states
later
on
that
an
assignment
is
required,
but
that
the
contractor
is
required
to
get
it.
and
i
think
some
people
have
proceeded
on
that
assumption
because
it
never
--
so
long
as
assignments
were
in
place
and
were
enforceable,
it
never
really
mattered
whether
they
were
needed.
but
to
continue
my
answer
to
justice
kagan,
i
wanted
to
point
out,
under
respondent's
theory,
universities
could
make
a
conscious,
calculated
decision
that,
rather
than
obtain
an
assignment
for
their
inventors,
they
would
simply
agree
with
the
inventor
that
royalties
would
be
split
in
--
in
the
same
manner
as
previously,
but
that
the
inventor
would
retain
title
and,
perhaps
with
the
assistance
of
the
university's
technology
transfer
office,
would
negotiate
with
commercial
entities.
and
the
effect
would
be
to
contract
around
bayh-dole;
commercialization
could
occur
without
complying
with
any
of
the
prerequisites.
