mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
bayh-dole
act
sets
forth
a
comprehensive
disposition
of
rights
in
inventions
made
by
nonprofit
organizations
and
small
business
organizations
under
federal
funding
agreements.
that
disposition
specifically
defines
the
rights
of
inventors
and
it
puts
them
in
the
third
position
behind
the
contractor,
the
nonprofit
contractor,
and
behind
the
government,
and
specifically
says
that
the
inventor
may
only
receive
rights
--
that
is
to
say,
take
title
--
when
the
--
when
the
contractor
has
declined
to
take
title
or
defaulted
in
some
respect,
and
the
government
itself
has
--
has
likewise
declined
to
take
title.
in
this
case
roche's
sole
claim
rests
on
an
assignment
from
an
inventor
who
was
at
that
time
i
think
without
question
a
stanford
employee
who
was
working
on
a
project
under
a
federal
funding
agreement.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
your
honor,
the
act
deals
specifically
with
independent
contractors,
and
--
the
regulations
at
least
do.
and
they
indicate
that
the
--
that
the
contractor
in
that
instance,
if
in
fact
working
on
a
federally
funded
project,
would
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
contractor.
but
i
don't
believe
it
would
affect
the
outcome
in
terms
of
whether
it
would
be
a
bayh-dole
invention.
the
--
the
critical
fact
here
is
that
the
inventor
was
working
on
a
project
that
was
already
funded,
his
work
at
cetus
was
part
of
that
project.
and
then
that
result
was--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
what
they
say,
your
honor,
and
i
would
submit
that
is
plainly
not
correct.
we
deal
with
this
at
pages
21
and
22
of
our
yellow
brief,
and
we
specifically
talk
about
the
fact
--
there's
several
critical
facts
here.
one
is
that
the
article
which
was
written
about
the
work
at
cetus,
the
jid
article
at
page
135
of
the
joint
appendix,
specifically
has
a
footnote
indicating
that
the
work
reported
on
--
that
is
the
work
at
cetus
on
the
assay
--
was
funded
by
the
two
specific
grants
in
issue.
dr.
merigan,
who
is
the
head
of
the
lab
at
stanford
that
dr.
holodniy
worked
in,
talks
in
his
declaration
at
98
and
99
of
the
joint
appendix
--
specifically
talks
about
how
dr.
holodniy's
work
was
part
of
the
aids
research
center
at
stanford
and
part
of
an
aids
clinical
trial
at
stanford,
and
all
of
that
work
was
federally
funded.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
you
have
to
look
very
carefully
at
the
facts,
and
i
don't
want
to
speak
loosely
and
categorically
about
the
facts,
but
what
--
what
i
will
say
is
that
in
a
situation
where
--
and
this
is
very
clearly
true
--
in
a
situation
where
prior
work
is
done
by
persons
who
are,
to
start
with
a
clearer
set
of
facts,
not
affiliated
with
the
university,
and
they
--
let's
say
that
person
conceives
of
an
invention,
and
that
later
the
university
takes
that
conception
of
an
invention
and
reduces
it
to
practice.
the
conception
by
a
person
who
is
not
a
university
employee,
if
--
if
there's
no
university
person
involved
in
the
conception,
then
it
can't
be
an
invention
of
the
contractor,
because
you
can't
be
an
inventor
without
being
part
of
the
conception.
so
that's
a
variation
on
your
honor's
--
on
your
honor's
question,
but
it's
a
--
it's
a
clear
example
where
bayh-dole
would
not
apply.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
you
would
--
you
--
i
think
you
are
now
in
a
zone
where
one
of
the
things
that
has
to
be
considered
is
the
equitable
character
of
any
assignment
of
a
future
interest,
that
is
to
say
a
future
invention.
because
if
in
fact
what
was
assigned
was,
as
here,
the
possibility
that
there
might
at
some
future
time
be
an
invention,
then
equitable
considerations
come
into
play;
and
one
of
the
equitable
considerations
we
think
the
one
that
is
of
paramount
significance,
is
the
fact
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
said
in
the
context
of
bayh-dole
that
when
the
united
states
invests
money
in
research,
it
wants
certain
things
to
happen
that
are
very
carefully
set
out
in
the
--
in
the
bayh-dole
act.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it
depends
what's
assigned,
your
honor.
if
--
if
b
is
a
bona
fide
to
purchaser
under
35
u.s.c.
261,
then
b
would
prevail.
if
b
is
not
a
bona
fide
purchaser,
and
that
can
only
apply
under
261,
where
you
are
dealing
with
an
assignment
in
law
of
a
patent
or
a
patent
application,
then
i
think
you
are
in
the
difficult
zone
where
there
are
two
competing
interests
in
the
future
possibility
of
an
invention;
and
i
don't
know
that
i
can,
without
knowing
all
the
facts,
even
intelligently
try
to
tell
you
what
would
end
up
happening.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
we
have,
your
honor.
i
think
--
essentially
i
would
say,
frankly
that
that
is--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
that
is
at
the
heart
of
--
of
our
--
of
our
core
argument
and
of
the
government's
argument,
and
it
is
that,
as
the
trial
court
here
held,
and
as
we've
said
in
our
brief
several
times,
the
inventor,
because
he
is
working
here
at
the
time
of
the
assignment
on
a
federally
funded
project
as
an
employee
of
stanford
university,
is
essentially
working
on
something
covered
by
bayh-dole;
and
being
covered
by
bayh-dole
means
that
he
lacks
the
power
to
transfer
title
to
this
future
invention
to
someone
else
because
the
statute
has
already
spoken
for
it.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
one
interesting
thing
about
that
discussion
is
that
the
very
first
case
that
we
know
anything
about,
that
we're
aware
of,
making
that
distinction
and
relying
upon
the
immediate
effect
of
an
assignment
using
the
words
1991.
that
was
2
years
after
the
events
in
this
case,
so
how
was
stanford
supposed
to
know
that
that
fine
distinction
was
going
to
be
made?
we
think
the
critical
--
the
critical
issue
here
is
whether
the
inventor,
while
working
on
a
federally
funded
project
as
an
employee
of
the
contractor
--
and
there's
no
doubt
that
his
work
at
cetus
was
part
of
his
stanford
research.
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
pages
16a
to
18a
of
the
petition
appendix
for
the
court
of
appeals
decision
or
pages
62a
and
69a
for
the
district
court
opinion.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
everyone
knew
he
came
to
cetus
to
advance
his
work
on
his
stanford
research,
which
was
in
fact
funded,
as
we
show
at
pages
21
and
22.
and
the
bayh-dole--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--universities,
and
--
and
i
think
everybody
engaged
in
research,
is
generally
careful.
they
have
policies
in
place
to
get
assignments,
and
there
are
lots
of
reasons
why
that
would
be
true.
it
was
true
before
the
bayh-dole
act.
it's
a
--
it's
a
wise
and
prudent
practice
to
have
an
understanding
with
your
employees
about
who
is
going
to
own
what.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
about
the
universe
of
them.
i
--
i
know
that
the
--
that
the
stanford
policy
in
this
case
relevant
at
this
time
was
a
policy
that
indicated
employees
could
retain
title
in
many
instances,
but
not
where
federal
law,
applicable
law,
says
that
they
can't
retain
title;
and
in
that
sense
they
do.
but
those
policies
i
think
are
very
clearly
in
virtually
every
case
i
know
anything
about
policies
that
are
signed
by
an
employee
pretty
much
the
day
they
walk
in
the
door,
as
i
think
was
the
case
here
with
dr.
holodniy
back
in
1988.
and
it's
a
general
understanding
of
what
the
expectations
are,
and
i
don't
want
to
here
be
heard
to
say
at
all
that
we
think
this
is
an
unwise
thing
or
that
it
isn't
a
good
thing
that
it
goes
on.
it's
a
very
good
thing
that
it
goes
on,
because
people
need
to
understand
what
the
situation
is.
the
critical
issue
is
whether,
in
the
event
that
that
fails
to
happen
for
some
reason
or
that
there
is
a
slip-up
here
where
a
fellow
going
to
visit
somewhere
on
the
first
day
there
has
something
put
under
his
nose
called
a
visitor's
confidentiality
agreement
which
he
happens
to
sign,
and
down
in
paragraph
2
it
talks
about
assigning
away
everything
that
he
ever
might
do
as
a
consequence
of
this.
the
point
is
that
in
that
situation
you
can't
have
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
which
is
the
critical
paramount
interest
in
this
case
--
i
want
to
make
that
very
clear.
it's
the
interest
in
the
united
states
when
it
spends
millions
and
billions
of
dollars
on
research
in
having
that
research
handled
in
a
certain
way,
having
the
fruits
of
it
dealt
with
in
a
certain
way
and
having
it
go
where
congress
says
it
should
go.
now,
the
critical--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
don't
know
--
i
wouldn't
tell
you
categorically--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
we
would
not,
i
think,
be
willing,
and
i
wouldn't
think
anybody
would
be
willing,
to
break
the
law.
and
we
would
submit
that
that's
what's
going
on
here.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
the
statute
--
the
statute
defines
a
universe
of
covered
cases
which
are
inventions
of
the
contractor,
which
we
think
the
other
side
uses
those
words
to
argue
that
--
that
inventions
of
the
contractor
are
only
the
ones
the
--
the
contractor
already
owns
by
virtue
of--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
those
two
provisions
are
essentially
their
argument
for
narrowing
the
universe
of
inventions
that
is
covered.
and
i
want
to
just
say
at
the
outset,
the
critical
thing
about
narrowing
the
universe
of
inventions
covered
is
that
it
narrows
the
universe
of
inventions
in
which
the
government's
rights
to,
number
one,
itself
receive
title
under
several
provisions
of
the
act;
number
two,
itself
to
enforce
a
whole
series
of
requirements
under
202(c)(4),
(5),
(6),
(7)
and
a
variety
of
other
provisions,
to
itself
march
in
and
do
things.
when
you
define
out
of
that
category
instances
where
inventions
exist
and
were
produced
with
federal
money,
then
you're
limiting
the
coverage
of
the
government's
interests.
but
on
the
two
provisions
at
issue,
we
think
clearly
they
do
not
mean
what
the
other
side
says
they
mean.
the
word
"invention
of"
someone
is
conventionally
understood,
if
you
hear
the
light
bulb
was
an
invention
of
thomas
edison,
you
don't
think
thomas
edison
owns
the
patent;
you
think
he
invented
it.
the
same
thing
is
true.
even
though--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--thank
you,
your
honor.
can
i
answer?
basically,
what
i
would
say
is,
on
the
first
point:
you're
quite
correct,
obviously,
that
that's
the
general
rule,
that
inventors
receive
title.
however,
just
in
this
case,
in
this
fact
pattern,
the
array
of
so-called
vesting
statutes
that
predated
the
bayh-dole
act
throughout
the
30
years
in
between
are
statutes
that
specifically,
in
most
instances
without
any
discussion
of
an
assignment,
simply
vested
title
directly
in
the
united
states.
so
congress
clearly
had
the
power
to
do
that,
and
they
did
it,
and
no
one
ever
seriously
argued
that
they
couldn't.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
take
exception
to
how
immense
it
is,
given
the
prior
history
in
which
the
government
simply
took
title
to
these
very
same
inventions.
but
on
the
issue
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
"retain",
that's
actually
a
word
that
has
a
lot
of
potential
connotations.
the
one
thing
we
can
be
sure
of
here
without
any
doubt
is
that
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
had
to
have
ownership
before,
because
in
section
202(d)
of
the
act,
the
act
specifically
talks
about
the
inventor's
opportunity
to
itself
be
considered
for
retention
of
title,
and
everyone
agrees
that
that
phrase
is
one
that
never
applies
when
the
inventor
already
has
title.
so
"retain"
doesn't
mean
that.
we
would
submit
that
what
the
word
"retain"
means
is--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--okay.
202(d)--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--202(d)
is
--
is
the
section
--
where
is
it
in
the
--
okay.
it
is
--
it
is
on
page
9a.
and
it
says
that
if
a
contractor
does
not
elect
to
retain
title
--
9a
of
the
blue
brief,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
"--
does
not
elect
to
retain
title
to
a
subject
invention
in
cases
subject
to
this
section,
the
federal
agency
may
consider
and,
after
consultation
with
the
contractor,
grant
a
request
for
retention
of
rights
by
the
inventor.
"
on
38
of
the
red
brief,
you
will
see
the
other
side
vehemently
arguing
that
that
only
applies
when
the
inventor
doesn't
have
title
to
start
with.
so
you
can't
have
"retain"
mean
one
thing
in
one
place
and
place
--
and
one
thing
in
the
other.
your
honor,
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
--
i
think
the
place
to
start
here
is
with
the
fact
that
congress,
faced
with
a
history
under
which
the
federal
government
had
taken
ownership
outright
of
federally
funded
inventions
in
approximately
80
percent
of
the
cases,
enacted
a
statute
to
change
that
because
the
government
wasn't
any
good
at
getting
the
stuff
developed.
and
so
they
--
they
defined
the
coverage
in
terms
of
--
to
cover
these
two
phrases,
inventions
of
the
contractor.
there
is
no
question,
if
you
look
at
section
200
on
1a
of
the
blue
brief,
you
will
see
in
the
middle
of
this
initial
policy
and
objective
section
a
reference
to
what
they
thought
they
were
talking
about.
at
the
very
bottom
of
that
page,
on
the
bottom
line,
they
talk
about
ensuring
that
inventions
made
by
nonprofit
organizations
and
small
business
organizations.
that's
the
universe
they
wanted
to
cover.
the
same
words
--
"inventions
made
by
those
organizations"
--
are
in
the
heading
of
the
regulations,
and
they
appear
elsewhere
throughout
the
regulations.
so
they
meant
to
cover
the
universe
of
inventions
that
those
institutions
create.
we
talked
earlier
about
the
word
"retain".
the
word
202(d),
mean
that
whoever
is
retaining
it
must
have
owned
it
before
they
started,
because
it's
a
hundred
percent
clear,
just
from
thinking
about
the
statute
and
from
reading
page
38
of
the
red
brief,
that
when
an
inventor
is
allowed
to
be
considered
for
retention
of
title,
he
never
has
ownership
of
it.
and
so
the
word
"retain"
can't
mean
that.
what
does
the
word
"retain"
mean?
i
would
submit
the
word
"retain"
means
what
it
often
means.
it
means
that
sometimes
in
a
situation,
someone
is
allowed
to
continue
holding
something
subject
to
conditions
that
may
change,
and
perhaps
in
spite
of
realities
that
make
you
think
that's
surprising.
for
example,
a
parent
may
be
allowed
to
retain
custody
after
a
disputed
custody
hearing.
that's
a
temporary
thing,
