chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
09-1159,
the
board
of
trustees
of
stanford
v.
roche
molecular
systems.
mr.
ayer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
theory
--
i
mean,
you're
cloaking
yourself
in
the
interests
of
the
united
states,
but
we're
going
to
hear
from
their
lawyer
shortly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
ever
have
different
arrangements
with
respect
to
the
assignments
depending
upon
who
the
researcher
is?
i
mean,
i
suppose
--
i
would
have
supposed
there
are
very
prominent
researchers
that
you
would
like
to
have
at
stanford,
and
you
would
be
willing
to
negotiate
less
than
a
requirement
of
full
assignment
of
their
inventions
in
order
to
--
to
get
that
person
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
you'd
be
willing
--
wouldn't
you
be
willing
to
sell
the
interests
of
the
united
states
down
the
river
to
get
--
to
advance
your
interests?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
thought
the
law
meant
that
the
united
states
got
whatever
interest
the
contractor
got,
right?
and
if
--
it
doesn't
say
what
the
contractor
can
or
can't
do
with
respect
to
the
employees
it
has.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
fleming.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
a
reason
that
the
federal
government
can't
just
say,
from
now
on
we're
not
going
to
give
any
money
to
stanford
or
anybody
else
until
they
have
an
agreement
making
clear
that
the
inventor
is
going
to
ensure
sure
that
title
rests
with
the
university,
which
then
triggers
the
bayh-dole
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
have
no
problem
--
i
mean,
mr.
stewart
is
being
careful
for
his
client,
but
you're
comfortable
with
the
idea
that
the
government
could
impose
that,
even
though
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
requires
it,
and
even
though
somebody
could
argue
that
the
statute's
somewhat
inconsistent
with
it,
in
the
--
in
the
sense
that
it
wants
to
promote
commercialization.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
problem
with--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--are
you
finished
answering
justice
breyer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
might
lead
to
the
same
thing
that
the
bayh-dole
act
was
intended
to
get
away
from,
which
is
a
variety
of
different
arrangements
across
the
vast
array
of
government
agencies,
because
they
will
have
differing
degrees
of
interest,
differing
leverage
with
respect
to
what
they
insist
on
from
the
different
contractors.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
--
are
you
aware
of
situations
where
the
universities
enter
into
different
types
of
arrangements
with
different
types
of
professors
and
researchers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
presumably
some
of
them
have
greater
degree
of
leverage
than
others
and
can
say:
look,
you've
got
to
make
sure
i
get
this
much
of
the
royalties,
and
i'm
only
going
to
give
you
that
much.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
just--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
not
just
that
there
may
or
may
not
be
an
effective
assignment.
the
problem
is
you
may
get
together,
you
the
inventor
get
together
with
the
university
and
say,
look,
the
one
--
we
share
an
interest
in
making
sure
none
of
this
goes
to
the
government.
why
would
we
want
to
do
that?
so
you
make
an
arrangement.
your
theory
--
your
theory
is
that
whatever
the
contractor
gets
is
what
the
government
can
get
and
nothing
more,
so
the
contractor
and
you
work
out
a
deal
to
make
sure
that
the
contractor
doesn't
get
the
invention
or
the
patent,
it
just
gets
royalties.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
they're
happy
because
they're
--
the
value
of
the
patent
is
not
diluted
by
the
fact
that
the
government
is
going
to
be
doing
something
with
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
at
the
end
of
the
day,
though,
your
theory
is
that
congress
passed
a
law
that
could
--
i
guess
this
is
justice
breyer's
point
--
be
easily
circumvented
not
only
by
the
inventor
but
by
the
inventor
and
the
contractor
working
together.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
nothing
inequitable
about
it.
it's
a
perfectly
fair
deal
between
the
university
and
the
inventor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
are
the
obligations
--
what
are
the
obligations
that
the
contractor
undertakes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
things
--
all
things
that
the
government
had
and
more
under
the
prior
system?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
ayer,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
