justice
john
a.
campbell
this
case
is
about
an
invention,
a
new
procedure
for
testing
blood
samples
to
determine
the
amount
of
hiv
in
a
patient's
blood.
the
issue
is
who
owns
the
patent
rights
to
this
invention,
the
inventor,
the
university
where
he
conducted
his
research
or
the
federal
government
which
funded
part
of
the
research
through
a
grant
to
the
university.
the
inventor
here
is
dr.
mark
holodniy.
other
people
were
involved
as
well
but
i'm
going
to
simplify
things
quite
a
bit.
he
was
a
researcher
at
stanford
and
while
there
to
help
move
his
research
along
and
with
stanford's
blessing,
he
went
to
cetus,
a
small
research
company.
when
he
did
that,
he
signed
an
agreement
saying
that
the
right
to
anything
he
invented
based
on
his
research
at
cetus
was
assigned
to
cetus.
now,
after
his
stint
at
cetus,
holodniy
returned
to
stanford
where
he
perfected
the
new
technique
and
stanford
patented
it.
meanwhile,
cetus
was
bought
by
roche
molecular
systems,
a
medical
company.
roche
thought
it
had
the
rights
to
holodniy's
invention
because
of
the
prior
assignment
to
cetus.
roche
turned
that
invention
into
a
usable
product
and
marketed
it
and
the
product
is
now
used
around
the
world
to
treat
aids.
stanford
sued
roche
for
infringing
its
patent.
roche
pointed
out
that
holodniy
had
assigned
the
rights
to
whatever
he
invented
from
his
research
at
cetus
to
cetus
and
thus
to
roche.
stanford
thought
it
had
a
similar
assignment
of
its
own
from
holodniy
but
the
courts
below
ruled
that
it
did
not
and
that
ruling
is
not
before
us.
but
stanford
had
another
argument,
it's
said
holodniy
had
no
rights
to
assign
to
cetus
in
the
first
place
because
if
a
federal
law
called
the
bayh-dole
act
after
senators
bayh
and
dole.
stanford
argued
that
under
the
bayh-dole
act,
it
was
entitled
to
the
rights
to
the
invention
all
along
because
it
was
developed
with
federal
funds
and
stanford
was
the
grantee
of
those
funds.
so
we
had
to
decide
whether
under
this
federal
statute,
the
bayh-dole
act,
rights
to
an
invention
developed
in
part
with
federal
funds
belong
with
the
federal
government,
the
contractor,
stanford,
or
the
inventor,
holodniy
or
by
assignment,
roche.
the
answer
turns
on
complicated
issues
of
statutory
interpretation
and
those
are
spelled
out
in
our
opinion.
i
won't
go
through
all
the
nuances
of
that
analysis
here.
but
a
couple
of
things
are
interesting.
first,
the
owner
is
not
the
federal
government.
everybody
including
the
federal
government
pretty
much
agrees
with
that.
the
government
gets
a
full
license
to
use
whatever
is
invented
but
none
of
the
ideas
--
but
one
of
the
ideas
behind
the
bayh-dole
act
is
that
others
involved
in
federally
funded
research
would
do
a
better
job
of
commercializing
their
inventions
for
the
good
of
everyone.
the
other
interesting
thing
is
that
there
is
a
very
old
and
established
principle
in
this
area
that
an
inventor
owns
his
invention
even
if
he
invents
it
in
the
course
of
employment
by
another.
now
that's
obviously
not
the
normal
employment
rule.
somebody
on
an
assembly
line
doesn't
own
the
car
he
helps
make,
the
employer
does.
but
it's
a
different
rule
under
the
patent
law
and
always
has
been.
without
getting
into
the
details,
we
don't
think
that
congress
changed
that
rule
in
the
bayh-dole
act.
we
think
that
if
it
meant
to,
it
surely
would've
made
such
a
dramatic
change
very
clear
and
it
certainly
didn't
do
that
in
the
bayh-dole
act.
so
the
rights
to
holodniy's
invention
were
holodniy's
and
by
assignment
roche's.
now,
as
a
practical
matter
most
of
these
issues
have
been
and
will
be
resolved
by
assignments.
universities
and
research
companies
will
make
researcher
signed
clear
assignment
agreements.
and
when
researchers
go
from
a
university
to
a
research
company
and
back
again,
the
university
and
the
research
company
will
have
cross
assignments
to
help
sort
out
issues
that
might
arise.
but
all
that
will
be
done
against
the
background
rule
that
we
hold
was
not
affected
by
the
federal
statute
at
issue
here.
as
congress
said
220
years
ago
in
the
very
first
patent
act,
"whoever
invents
or
discovers
any
new
and
useful
process,
machine,
manufacture
or
composition
of
matter
may
obtain
a
patent
therefore."
and
as
we
said
in
an
old
decision,
an
invention
"remains
the
property
of
him
who
conceived
it".
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
breyer
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joined.
