just
--
just
as
a
hypothetical,
suppose
--
suppose
it
was
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested;
or
indeed
suppose
this
individual
even
before
he
was
employed
by
stanford
at
all,
much
less
employed
by
a
stanford
project
funded
by
the
federal
government,
entered
into
this
kind
of
an
agreement
with
somebody
that
he
had
been
working
for.
how
--
how
would
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
does
that
change
when
you
--
when
you
alter
the
hypothetical
so
that
he
was
already
an
employee
of
stanford,
but
was
not
working
as
an
employee
of
stanford
when
he
was
at
this
other
company?
you
could
still
say
that
--
that
stanford
was
not
the
inventor.
justice
antonin
scalia
plus
the
word
"retained",
don't
forget
that,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
isn't
vesting
it
in
the
united
states.
this
is
--
this
is
speaking
of
the
--
the
university
retaining
title.
if
--
if
the
government
was
going
to
make
such
a
huge
change
from
normal
patent
law
where
the
inventor
owns
his
invention
until
he
assigns
it
to
his
employer,
why
wasn't
that
set
forth
clearly?
all
they
needed
was
one
paragraph.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
when
you're
working
on
a
--
on
a
government-funded
project,
you
have
no
right
to
your
invention
as
an
--
as
an
employee.
it
automatically
vests
in
the
--
in
the
university.
i
would
have
expected
that
to
be
set
forth
very
clearly
if
--
if
they
were
making
such
an
immense
change
in
patent
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
lost
you.
go
over
that
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
got
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
why
can't
the
federal
government
just
say:
we're
not
going
to
fund
your
project
unless
you
get
assignments
of
inventions
by
all
the
employees
working
on
it?
what's
the
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
by
--
and
by
the
federal
0
voluntary
decision
to
provide
funds.
i
mean,
certainly
you
can
condition
your
grant
of
funds
on
that.
i
--
i
really
don't
see
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
patent
law
or
is
it
regular
contract
law?
doesn't
it
apply
in
other
fields
as
well?
i
mean,
i'm
--
i'm
not
aware
that
this
is
a
peculiar
doctrine
applicable
to
patent
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
do
it
in
the
future.
if
somebody
else
gets
an
assignment
before
that
agreement
is
--
is
executed,
the
assignment
prevails.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
refuse
to
fund.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
refuse
to
fund
without
a
clear
assignment
upfront.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
federal
government
hadn't
been
doing
much
with
the
parents
that
it
acquired
automatically?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
reason
they
gave
it
to
the
university
or
to
the
private
sector.
