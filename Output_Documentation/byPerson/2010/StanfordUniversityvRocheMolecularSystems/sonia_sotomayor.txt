what
if
the
inventor
had
not
been
an
employee?
if
it
had
been
an
independent
contractor
who
was
working
in
combination
with
the
university,
how
does
this
automatic
vesting--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--don't
you
think
that
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
the
--
as
a
practical
matter,
when
a
university
is
seeking
a
patent,
doesn't
it
have
to
identify
the
inventors
and
get
their
--
proof
of
their
assignment
before
it
can
claim
ownership
of
the
patent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
different
question
than
mine.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
the
patent
office
require
the
assignment
for
purposes
of
showing
ownership
of
the
patent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
ask
--
that
all
sounds
to
me
like
there's
an
assumption
about
assignments,
even
in
the
patent
law,
that
you
--
the
section
that
you
just
recited
to
me
says
a
promise
to
assign
will
get
you
an
assignment
if
the
inventor
won't
give
it
to
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--is
there
any
conceivable
reason
that,
under
the
bayh-dole
act,
whose
intent
was
to
protect
the
government's
interests
after
it's
funded
the
discovery
or
implementation
of
an
invention,
that
congress
would
have
ever
wanted
the
university
and
the
inventor
to
be
able
to
circumvent
the
act
by
failing
to
secure
an
assignment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
frankly,
every
act
before
this
one
--
actually,
the
ipa
--
required
that
the
contractor
seek
assignments
from
inventors.
why
would
this
act
omit
such
a
critical
term
if
it
didn't
intend
to
vest
title
in
the
contractor?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
government
just
said
--
if
we
say
that
the
contractor
and
the
inventor
can
do
what
they
want,
what
sane
university
wouldn't
enter
into
agreements
with
employees
letting
the
employees
retain
title
to
their
inventions
and
just
sharing
royalties
thereafter?
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
for
universities
to
do
what
you're
saying
--
get
assignments
--
because
they
could
just
continue
taking
the
bulk
of
the
royalties.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
sorry.
they
--
they
do.
i
mean,
the
general
rule
is
that
the
inventor
owns
the
patent.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
there
--
there
is
proof
that
they
can
go
into
court,
an
employer
can
go
into
court
and
show
that
the
inventor
was
hired
for
this
specific
item
and
the
law
would
presume
or
recognize
the
employer's
rights;
but
why
would
congress
leave
all
of
that
up
to
the
nature
of
the
contract
that
the
university
entered
into
with
its
inventors?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
--
but
the
question
i
started
with
and
justice
kagan
has
picked
up
on,
why
would
congress
create
this
act
relying
on
assignments
and
not
have
a
provision
requiring
one?
nothing
in
the
act,
nothing
in
its
regulations,
nowhere
is
there
a
requirement
that
federal
contractors
seek
assignments.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
that
cetus
would
have
let
the
doctor
in
absent
the
agreement
between
cetus
and
stanford?
wasn't
that
the
primary
reason
they
permitted
the
doctor
in?
it
wasn't
for
this
ephemeral
assignment
of
an
unknown
invention.
it
was
because
the
university
and
the
company
had
entered
into
a
share
agreement
of
what
would
happen
if
they
contributed
to
a
stanford
invention.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they
had
a
preexisting
cooperative
arrangement,
correct?
