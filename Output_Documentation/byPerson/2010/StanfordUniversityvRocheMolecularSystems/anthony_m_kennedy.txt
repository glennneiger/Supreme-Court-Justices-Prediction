justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
me,
assume
no
federal
act,
let's
just
talk
about
two
--
or
parties
that
are
not
involved
with
the
federal
government.
inventor
agrees
to
assign
to
a;
then
inventor
--
inventor
in
fact
assigns
to
b;
then
a
gets
the
patent--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
this
case,
if
you
do
not
prevail
on
your
principal
argument,
have
you
preserved
the
point
that
the
assignment
to
cetus
was
contrary
to
public
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
seem
to
discuss
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
justice
ginsburg's
question,
and
i
have
the
same
concern,
is
that
why
can't
we
resolve
this
case
in
a
simple
way?
what
you're
asking
for,
based
on
submissions
to
us
of
amici,
of
amicus
briefs,
means
a
very
great
change
in
how
--
how
--
how
patents
are
held.
if
we
can
resolve
this
case
on
a
simple
contract
basis,
why
not
do
it?
