what
have
universities
been
doing
for
the
last
30
years?
have
they
been
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
title
to
inventions
vested
in
them
automatically
or
have
they
been
very
careful
about
getting
assignments
from
all
of
their
employees?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
are
two
things
that
cut
very
strongly
against
your
argument.
i
mean,
there
are
many
things
that
cut
in
favor
of
it,
but
the
two
things
that
seem
to
me
to
cut
pretty
strongly
against
your
argument
are:
first,
that
it
has
long
been
the
rule
that
inventors
have
title
to
their
patents
initially,
even
if
they
make
those
inventions
while
working
for
somebody
else.
and
the
second
is
that
you
are
relying
on
a
provision
that
says
that
the
nonprofit
organization
may
elect
to
retain
title,
which
means
hold
onto
a
title,
that
the
--
the
organization
already
has.
there's
just
no
accepted
definition
of
the
word
"retain"
that
corresponds
to
the
meaning
that
you
want
to
assign
to
that
word.
"retain"
does
not
mean
obtain.

isn't
it
the
case
that
at
least
some
components,
possibly
many
components,
of
the
federal
government
for
the
last
30
years
have
been
proceeding
on
that
assumption
that
assignments
were
necessary?
the
grants
here
were
--
were
from
nih,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
points
out
that
the
nih
compliance
guidelines
say
by
law
an
inventor
has
initial
ownership
of
invention;
however,
awardee
organizations
are
required
by
the
bayh-dole
act
to
have
in
place
employee
--
employee
agreements
requiring
an
inventor
to
assign
or
give
ownership
of
an
invention
to
the
organization--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
isn't
there
a--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--isn't
there
a
big
difference
between
the
statute
and
the
prior
vesting
statutes?
the
prior
vesting
statutes
said
if
the
government
pays
for
the
research,
then
the
taxpayers
ought
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
patent.
but
this
statute
says
if
the
taxpayers
pay
for
the
research,
if
the
research
is
100
percent
funded
by
the
taxpayers,
taxpayers
don't
get
the
first
priority.
the
first
priority
goes
to
the
universities.
so
it's
totally
different
from
the
vesting
statute.
this
is
a
federal
subsidy
for
universities
and
other
nonprofits,
isn't
it?
