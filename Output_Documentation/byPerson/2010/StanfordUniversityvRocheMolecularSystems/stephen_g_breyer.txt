justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
though--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
that's
where
i
exactly
am.
i
mean,
the
--
the
brief
that
i
found
very,
very
interesting
is
that
filed
by
the
association
of
american
universities
and
the
advancement
for
science
and
the
council
on
education,
and
they
seem
to
take
the
line
that
you
are
--
i
don't
know
how
far
you
want
to
pursue
it.
they
say
the
strongest
analogy
is
with
government
employees,
and
if
you
look
at
government
employees
the
basic
rule
is,
the
federal
government
paid
for
it,
they
should
have
the
invention.
and
the
way
they
do
it
is
not
to
deny
the
employee
the
right
to
have
the
invention,
but
they
insist
upon
an
assignment,
assignment
of
an
exclusive
license.
and
there
are
cases
which
are
cited
here
that
suggest
that,
even
if
the
employee
tries
to
run
his
way
around
that
and
simply
goes
and
before
the
government
can
get
it
assigns
the
interest
to
a
third
party,
that
that
third
party
assignment
is
void
as
a
matter
of
public
policy;
and
that
the
assignment
to
the
government
of
the
exclusive
right
is
valid
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
legal
implication
from
the
executive
order
in
the
circumstance.
that
brings
me
back
to
where
justice
ginsburg
was,
and
justice
kennedy.
the
analogy
is
so
strong.
the
government
has
paid
for
it.
there
is
a
statute
here
that
really
seems
to
assume,
though
not
explicitly
say,
that
the
universities
will
have
title
--
that
we
simply
copy
what
happened
in
this
other
area
and
say
that
an
effort
to
assign
by
the
employee
in
contravention
of
what
this
statute
takes
as
its
basic
assumption,
and
a
contract,
is
void
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
because
the
exclusive
license
is
assumed
to
be
assumed
--
to
be
assigned
to
the
university,
though
i
don't
need
the
second
part;
for
this
case,
the
first
part
suffices.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
before
the
executive
order
or
after?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
understand
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
the
employee
seeks
to
assign
to
a
third
party
in
contravention
of
his
agreement,
rules
and
regulations,
et
cetera,
what
happens
to
that
assignment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
facts
are
that
he
was
supposed
to
give
it
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
there's
no
--
what
there
is,
is
an
agreement
with
the
government
that
says
any
invention
you
will
assign
to
the
government.
that's
the
agreement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now,
in
violation
of
that
agreement,
he
assigns
it
to
a
third
party.
what
happens
to
that
assignment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
the
court
said
--
my
reading
of
it,
must
be
yours
--
is
in
the
cases
they
cite,
that
assignment
to
the
third
party
is
void
as
a
matter
of
law
because
it's
contrary
to
public
policy.
that
was
my
reading
of
it,
and
i'm
questioning
you
about
that
because
i
might
not
have
read
it
correctly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
have
--
you
have
here
l-i
v.
montgomery,
li
v.
montgomery--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
am
i
right
or
not
in
your
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
then
your
clients
would
be
out
there
arguing,
oh,
but
you,
see
you
can't
assign
a
future
interests
in
the
fruits
from
black
acre;
i
mean,
you
can
promise
to
do
it,
but
black
acre
isn't
even
around
yet.
and
so
when
somebody
ran
in
and
got
those
fruits,
well,
then
now
we
have
a
fight;
and
in
law
the
second
person
wins,
and
in
equity
maybe
the
first
person
can
get
an
injunction.
i
don't
know.
but
i
guess
people
would
raise
that
kind
of
argument,
wouldn't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
fact--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
reason
it's
relevant
you
to,
of
course,
if
that's
so,
senator
bayh
and
senator
dole
passed
a
law
which
could
so
easily
be
subverted
by
individual
inventions
and
third-party
companies
that
there
might
be
a
large
class
of
cases
where
neither
the
university
nor
the
government
would
actually
get
much
of
a
benefit
from
research
that
the
taxpayer
had
funded.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
most
people
perhaps
thought
that
they
had
made
a
valid
assignment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
also
remarkable
the
other
way,
that
here
we
have
many
statutes
that
took
the
principle
that
when
the
government
pays
for
an
invention,
the
invention
vests
in
the
government.
now,
there's
that
statute,
that
background.
not
all
of
them,
but
some.
nasa,
various
others.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
that's
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
know
that;
i
know
that;
that
isn't
my
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
point
is
that
it's
somewhat
remarkable
because
of
this
new
statute,
now
that
happens
to
only
to
inventions
in
those
areas
that
are
inventions
of
the
contractor
who,
by
the
way,
invents
nothing.
human
beings
invent
things,
not
entities
like
universities.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
on
your
view
what
that
means
is
it
applies
to
nothing.
it
only
applies
to
those
things
that
the
contractor
freely
or
not
freely
decides
to
get
from
his
employee
--
if
he
uses
the
right
words
and
so
forth.
that
also
seems
a
little
surprising,
that
there
could
be
such
a
hole
in
what
used
to
be
public
ownership
of
such
matters.
i'm
not
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
--
i
started
off
sounding
a
little
sarcastic.
i
didn't
mean
to
be.
i
mean
to
be
--
serious
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
is
not
as
bad
as
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
okay.
now.
[laughter]
what
about
--
what
about
the
provision
that
says
there
shall
be
--
this
is
a
provision
of
the
law,
that
the
universities
are
supposed
to
enter
into
contracts,
funding
contracts
with
the
government
to
make
this
thing
effective.
hmm
--
effective.
effective
for
what?
effective
just
to
apply
to
some
of
the
things
that
universities
got
money
to
pay
for?
or
to
a
lot
of
them,
to
all
of
them?
