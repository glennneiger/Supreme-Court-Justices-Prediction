do
those
policies
ever
distinguish
between
federally
funded
projects
and
non-federally
funded
projects?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
stewart,
could
i
ask
you
just
a
factual
question?
when
the
federal
government
contracts
with
universities
or
other
nonprofits,
does
it
require
those
universities
to
get
assignments
from
their
employees?
and
if
so,
how?
justice
elena
kagan
so
why
doesn't
the
federal
government
just
require
assignments
from
employees
to
the
university?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
stewart,
do
you
know,
is
this
a
stanford-specific
problem
or
is
it
a
more
general
problem?
in
other
words,
are
there
many
universities
that
have
agreements
like
stanford's
that
would
be
subject
to
the
federal
circuit's
ruling?
or
is
this
just
an
example
of
one
university
that
unfortunately
has
a
bad
agreement?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
have
an
explanation,
mr.
fleming,
of
why
it
is
that
congress
left
such
a
big
problem
off
the
table?
justice
elena
kagan
in
other
words,
clearly
congress
was
thinking
about
how
to
protect
the
government's
interests
with
respect
to
these
patents,
and
to
say,
well,
we
have
these
interests
with
respect
to
patents
that
the
university
owns,
but
we
don't
have
those
same
interests
with
respect
to
patents
that
the
individual
researcher
owns,
just
seems
bizarre.
