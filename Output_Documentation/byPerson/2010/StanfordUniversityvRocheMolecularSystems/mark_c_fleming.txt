mr.
mark
c.
fleming
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
bayh-dole
act
had
the
laudable
objective
of
taking
inventions
off
of
government
shelves
and
putting
them
into
the
market,
and
it
succeeded;
but
it
did
not
change
the
long-standing
rule
dating
back
to
this
court's
decisions
in
hapgood
and
dubilier
that
title
to
an
invention
vests
in
the
inventor,
subject
to
assignment,
not
in
the
inventor's
employer.
we
submit
that,
in
light
of
this
long-settled
rule
which
congress
nowhere
purported
to
change,
the
act
should
be
given
its
straightforward
meaning.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
mr.
chief
justice,
i
know
of
no
reason
why
the
federal
government
cannot
make
that
requirement.
in
fact,
in
the
case
of
filmtec
v.
hydranautics,
a
federal
circuit
decision,
the
decision
reflects
that
the
federal
agency
there
did
exactly
that.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
as
far
as
i
know
that
has
never
been
litigated,
but
i
know
of
no
reason
why
a
federal
agency
couldn't
say
to
a
contractor,
we
want
to
be
absolutely
certain
that
the
assumption
that
underlay
not
only
bayh-dole
contracting,
but
contracting
going
all
the
way
back
to
attorney
general
biddle's
report
in
1947,
that
everyone
assumed
was
in
place,
which
is
an
assignment
from
an
employee,
whether
it's
a
federally
funded
invention
or
a
privately
funded
invention--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--would
go
to
the
contractor.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
justice
breyer,
let
me
begin
with
the
assumption
that
i
agree
underlies
the
aau
brief
about
the
situation
with
respect
to
government
employees.
actually,
i
think
the
situation
of
government
employees
supports
our
side,
because,
as
this
court
ruled
in
dubilier,
just
because
the
government
pays
for
an
invention
does
not
mean
that
it
automatically
owns
it.
in
dubilier,
there
were
employees
of
the
bureau
of
standards
who
came
up
with
particular
inventions
and
they
got
patents
on
them,
and
the
government
said:
we
own
that
because
these
are
government
employees.
and
this
court
ruled
that's
not
the
case.
government
employees
are
in
no
different
position
from
employees
of
private
entities
with
respect
to
ownership
of
their
inventions.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
the
executive
order
simply
says
that
there
can
be
regulations
where
the
employment
agreement,
which
is
essentially
regulatory
between
the
government
agency
and
the
individual,
can
result
in
an
assignment
from
the
individual
to
the
government,
just
as
the
same
applies
in
private
industry.
employees
sign
either
an
agreement
to
assign,
as
happened
with
dr.
holodniy
and
stanford
here,
or,
as
happened
with
cetus,
there's
a
present
assignment
of
future
expected
interest.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
that
there
was
no
rule
of
automatic
vesting
of
title,
which
is
what--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--there's
a
requirement
of
an
assignment.
and
the
regulations
actually
give
the
government
employee
the
right
to
refuse
to
assign
an
invention
to
the
government,
and
there
are
appeal
procedures,
as
set
out
in
many
of
the
regulations.
we
quote
the
air
force
regulations
in
our
brief,
but
there
are
many
others,
where
it's
possible
that
the
employee
will
wind
up
retaining
his
rights
to
an
invention
that
was
made,
even
though
he's
a
government
employee.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
well,
there
can
be
--
it
depends
on
the
facts,
justice
breyer.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
there
could
be
a
situation
where
there's
an
order
to
reassign,
as
there
was
in
the
heinemann
case.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
uh-huh.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
the
question
will
be
whether
that
assignment
can
be
void
under
ordinary
equitable
principles,
just
as
it
said
here.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
i'm
not
sure
which
case
your
honor
is
referring
to.
if
it's
the
heinemann
case--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--well,
li
v.
montgomery,
is
i
believe--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--i
--
i
don't
think
so,
justice
breyer.
i
think
li
v.
montgomery
is
the
unpublished
decision
of
the
d.c.
circuit,
which
has
less
than
a
sentence
of
discussion
of
this.
the
only
one
in
which
there
--
this
was
actually
covered
in
any
respect
i
think
is
the
heinemann
decision
in
the
federal
circuit.
but
there,
there
was
no
assignment
to
a
third
party.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
it
was
just
a
question
whether
the
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
the
purpose
of
the
act,
justice
sotomayor,
was
to
clarify
the
relationship
between
the
contractor
on
the
one
hand
and
the
federal
government
on
the
other
on
the
basis
of
uniform
federal--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--the
answer,
justice
sotomayor,
is
given
by
the
ipa,
which
is:
there
was
no
need
for
such
a
requirement.
universities
had
shown
that
they
were
perfectly
able
under
existing
law--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--if
that
were
to
happen,
justice
sotomayor,
the
remedy
that
mr.
stewart
kept
in
his
pocket,
which
is
that
the
agency
would
say
to
the
university:
you're
not
getting
any
more
federal
money
until
we
are
assured
that
the
assumption
that
has
underlaid
federal
contracting
since
1947
and
before
is
in
place,
namely,
that--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--well,
congress,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
bayh-dole
act,
was
considered
with
a
particular
type
of
uncertainty.
it
didn't
do
anything
and
everything
that
could
be
argued
to
create
uncertainty
in
tech
licensing.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
certainly.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
well,
certainly
there
are
different
approaches,
and
that
is
the
system
that
bayh-dole
left
in
place,
which
is
that
the
relationship
between
the
contractor
and
the
inventor
would
be
governed
under
ordinary
patent
contract
law
principles.
mit
and
caltech,
for
instance
--
i'm
sorry,
i
was
going
to
answer
the
question
with
examples,
but--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--mit
and
caltech
get
present
assignments
of
future
interest.
we
cite
those
policies
in
the
brief.
stanford,
for
its
own
reasons--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--the
question
presented
before
this
court
would
not
be
presented.
there
would
be
other
arguments
we
might
have
as
to
whether
that
earlier
assignment
was
enforceable
as
against
cetus
in
light
of
representations
that
were
made
at
the
time
dr.
holodniy
came
in.
but
justice
ginsburg,
your
question
is
--
is
sound,
which
is
that
there
is
this
distinction
between
an
agreement
to
assign
and
a
present
assignment
of
future
expected
interests.
that
has
been
the
law
for
decades.
there
are
plenty
of
settled
expectations
based
on
that.
that
has
not
been
challenged,
not
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
not
in
the
opening
brief
of
stanford,
and
it
only
comes
up
in
a
footnote
on
the
penultimate
page
of
the
reply
brief.
so
i
would
submit--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--the
question
presented
here
would
not
arise,
because
the
only
effective
assignment
of
the
invention
would
have
been
the
assignment
that
stanford
got
subsequently
from
all
three
coinventors
and
filed
in
the
patent
office
in
1995,
recognizing
that
it
couldn't
simply
say:
bayh-dole
act
vests
title
in
stanford,
but
rather,
we
need
an
assignment,
and
it
got
one.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
that's
a
distinction,
justice
ginsburg,
that
goes
back
to
the
federal
circuit
decision
in
arachnid
by
judge
giles
rich,
who
is
a
notable
authority
on
the
patent
act.
he
relied
on
the
curtis
treatise
from
1873.
but
if
that
were
an
issue
that
the
court
wished
to
reconsider,
i
think--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--no,
not
in
particular.
an
agreement
to
assign
is
specifically
that.
it's
an
agreement
to
do
an
assignment
in
the
future.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
that's--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--that
comes
from
the
filmtec
decision,
which
relied
on
justice
storey's
decision
in
mitchell,
and
it's
used,
again,
by
universities
like
caltech
and
mit
that
rely
on
the
validity
of
a
present
assignment
of
future
expected
interest.
i
mean,
i
know
that
the
issue
of
the
interpretation
of
agreements
to
assign
was
addressed
in
the
cert
petition
in
prostar
v.
ip
venture,
which
this
court
denied
cert
on
three
terms
ago.
but
if
this
court
were
to
wish
to
reconsider
that
doctrine,
i
would
submit
it
can
be
done
in
an
appropriate
case
where
there
is
an
amicus
briefing
on
that
issue.
that's
not
been
considered
here
at
all.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
i
--
they
--
they
would
be
protected
from
this
particular
constellation
of
facts
that
came
up
in
this
case.
there
might
be
other
problems--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--the
point,
justice
breyer,
is
that
all
these
questions
are
resolved
in
the
exactly
same
way
when
we're
not
talking
about
a
federally
funded
invention.
the
bayh-dole
act
has
nothing
to
say
about
this.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
those
questions
might
be
relevant--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
inference,
justice
breyer.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
the
fact
that
this
has
not
happened
at
all
in
30
years
of
the
bayh-dole
act.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
well,
in
most
situations
there
will
be
a
valid
assignment,
but
the
fact
that
stanford
here
did
not
get
an
effective
assignment
from
dr.
holodniy
is
no
reason
to
read
the
bayh-dole
act
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
draft
it.
and--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--it
that
it
doesn't--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--i
think--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--i
think
in
that
situation,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
would
be
other
doctrines
that
the
government
or
a
bona
fide
third-party
purchaser
could
invoke,
including
section
261
of
the
patent
act
or
a
lawsuit
for
a
reassignment,
as
is
happening
in
fenn
v.
yale
or
a--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--it's
not
that
it
can
be
circumvented.
it's
--
there
are
efforts,
there
are
ways
in
which
if
there
is
an
inequitable
assignment,
it
can
be
attacked
in
equity.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
in
that
event
the
government
has
all
the
remedies
that
mr.
stewart
was
talking
about.
as
a
matter
of
leverage,
it
could
take
the
patent
by
eminent
domain,
and
just
compensation
might
be
quite
low
if
in
fact
it
has
funded
all
of
the
research.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
that's
quite
right.
what
it
can't
do
is
relitigate
dubilier
and
just
say
that
because
we
funded
it,
we
own
it.
it
doesn't
make
that
rule
even
for
federal
employees.
an
assignment
is
required.
i
mean,
i
think--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--i--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--there
is
an
explanation,
justice
kagan.
which
is
that
the
universities
had
shown
they
didn't
need
a
vesting
rule
in
order
to
get
title
from
their
inventors,
just
the
same
as
private
industry
does
not
need
a
vesting
rule
to
get
title
to
nonfederally
funded
inventions.
this
was
something
that
attorney
general
biddle
in
1947--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--correct,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
that's
precisely
what
happens
in
the
context
of
federal
employees,
it's
governed
by
the
employment
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
employee,
and
it
was
shown
in
the
ipa
system,
in
the
system
that
attorney
general
biddle
talked
about
in
'47,
that
the
assignment
came
under
ordinary
patent
law.
there
was
no
need
for
a
new--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--because
there
was
no
need
for
such
a
requirement.
the
universities
and
industry
were
able
to
do
it
without
the
vesting
rule.
i
think
in
order
for
stanford
to
prevail
here,
to
justice
scalia's
point,
the
court
would
have
to
be
satisfied
that
--
that
congress
worked
a
highly
transformative
change
in
the
law
of
patent
ownership
and
assignment
and
did
it
in
a
very
obscure
and
indirect
way.
it
didn't
do
it
through
an
express
provision,
like
it
does
in
section
201
of
the
copyright
act,
which
expressly
says
that
an
employer
can
be
treated
like
an
author
for
purposes
of
the
copyright.
it
didn't
do
it
in
the
way
that
was
done
under
the
ipas,
which
is
it
was
left
entirely
up
to
private
contract.
supposedly
it
created
this
brand-new
vesting
rule,
not
through
a
clear
provision,
but
through
a
questionable
implications
from
the
preamble
or
other
provisions
of
the
act
that
don't
directly
apply,
and
it
did
it
without
a
peep
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
was
trying
to
do
this.
i
think
it's
remarkable
that
for
30
years
of
bayh-dole,
no
one
noticed
this
supposedly
all-encompassing
vesting
rule
until
this
case
arose.
as
justice
alito--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--there
are
three
of
them,
justice
breyer--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--and
they
all
specifically
say
in
terms
that
title
shall
vest.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
that's
quite
so.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
no,
no,
i
--
i
appreciate
the
question,
justice
breyer.
the
point
about
the
vesting
statutes,
it's
important
to
make
a
distinction
between
statutes
that
expressly
vested
title,
of
which
we
know
of
three,
and
statutes
under
which
the
government
was
entitled
to
ask
for
an
assignment
from
the
employee
or
the
contractor,
which
were--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--thank
you.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
effective
in
terms
of
inventions
of
the
contractor
to
which
the
university
has
the
right
to
retain
title.
try
as
stanford
may,
"retain"
does
not
mean
"get".
it
doesn't
mean
to
take
away
from
somebody.
an
invention
of
the
contractor
for
exactly
the
reason
you
say,
justice
breyer,
is
not
an
invention
created
by
a
contractor
employee.
contractors
don't
invent.
when
congress
wanted
to
refer
to
employees
in
the
act,
it
did;
in
section
202(c)(7),
it
refers
to
contractor
employees.
in
202(e),
it
refers
to
employees
of
federal
agencies.
if
--
if
congress
had
wanted
to
pass
a
law
that
completely
wiped
out
the
practice
of
leaving
the
relationship
between
contractor
and
inventor
to
private
contract,
it
had
plenty
of
examples
of
how
to
do
so.
it
had
the
nasa
statutes,
it
had
the
copyright
act,
or
it
could
have
just
written
something
clear
that
said
that.
it
did
none
of
those
things
because
it
didn't
need
to.
over
$200
billion
of
--
of
funding
comes
from
the
private
sector
to
--
to
technology
and
inventions
like
this
without
the
benefit
of
a
vesting
rule.
if
there's
any
lack
of
clarity
or
lack
of
certainty
in
this
world,
it
is
worked
out
through
the
patent
law,
ordinary
provisions,
or
through
the
common
law,
and
that
is
exactly
the
way
congress
envisioned
it
would
be
done
in
--
in
the
federally
funded
situation.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
there's
no
need
to
state
a
separate
rule
for
stanford
for
--
for
inventions
that
funded
out
of
its
endowment,
versus
inventions
that
are
funded
out
of
a
federal
grant.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
in
some
ways,
justice
alito,
that's
right.
and
the
point
is
that
the
statute
is
limited
to
inventions
where
the
contractor
has
gotten
title
from
its
inventors.
it
is
certain
different--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--absolutely
not,
justice
scalia.
that's
exactly--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--that
is
exactly
the
reason
this
act
was
--
was
enacted,
is
to
get
rid
of
the
inconsistent
practices
among
agencies
as
to
the
terms
of
contracts
with
contractors.
it
has
to
do
with
the
quid
pro
quo.
the
federal
government
gives
the
money,
it
agrees
not
to
demand
title,
and
in
return
the
contractor
takes
on
certain
obligations.
it
isn't
--
the
obligations
are
not
opposable
against
a
noncontractor,
like
cetus
or
roche
in
this
case.
and
that's
exactly
the
same
as
the
situations
that
we
cite
on
page
35
of
our
brief,
which
we've
offered
to
lodge
with
the
court,
where
stanford
co-owns
patents
with
noncontractor
companies
like
the--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--the
contractor
agrees
to
give
the
government
a
nonexclusive
paid-up
irrevocable
license.
it
agree
to
be
subject
to
march-in
rights
if
the
government
feels
that
the
invention
is
not
being
sufficiently
commercialized.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
yes.
that's
--
well,
that's
certainly
right.
it
will
all
depend
on
what
the
individual
federal
contract
has,
but
yes,
in
many
ways
the
government
was
giving
up
rights
in
the
bayh-dole
act,
and
that
was
deliberate,
because
it
was
felt
that
the
--
that
private
entities
would
do
a
better
job
of
commercializing
inventions
than
the
federal
government
was
doing,
and
that's
not
disputed,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
rights
that
apply
to
a
third
party
that
has
not
taken
on
obligations
from
the
government,
like
cetus,
that
simply
invited
mr.
holodniy
in,
in
order
to
collaborate,
but
before
it
did
so,
said:
we
need
an
agreement
to
protect
our
intellectual
property.
one
of
the
hypotheticals
that
underlies
mr.
ayer's
presentation
here
is
that
dr.
holodniy
was
some
kind
of
rogue,
faithless
employee
who
was
out
on
a
frolic
of
his
own
and
simply
decided
to
assign
away
all
his
inventions
in
satisfaction
of
a
personal
debt.
but
the
record
is
quite
the
contrary.
he
showed
up
because
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
the
pcr
technique
that
is
at
the
core
of
this
invention.
the
court
only
needs
to
read
pages
55
to
57
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
he
has
marched
through
each
of
the
steps
of
this
invention
that's
ultimately
claimed
in
the
patents
and
admits
that
he
had
not
done
any
one
of
them.
he
went
to
cetus,
he
took
the
--
he
had
the
benefit
of
a
free
flow
of
information
from
cetus
scientists,
and
he
also
got
confidential,
proprietary
materials
that
were
not
available
in
stores,
including,
particularly,
the
rna
standard,
which
is
used
every
single
time
one
of
these
assays
is
run.
it's
the
thing
that
gives
you
the
standard
curve
against
which
you
can
measure
the
data
from
your
unknown
sample
and
figure
out
what
the
quantity
of
hiv
is
in
your
patient's
sample.
that
was,
you
know,
not
available
at
stanford.
it
was
designed
by
alice
lang
of
cetus.
it
was
built
by
clayton
casipit
in
the
cetus
lab.
it
was
named
after
him,
using
his
initials,
cc
2,
and
mr.
casipit
handed
it
to
dr.
holodniy
in
a
tube
for
free.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
i
wouldn't
quite
agree
with
the
end
of
the
question,
justice
sotomayor.
what
happened
is
that
dr.
holodniy's
supervisor
at
stanford,
dr.
merigan,
sat
on
cetus's
scientific
advisory
board.
when
it
became
clear
that
dr.
holodniy
could
not
figure
out
how
to
do
a
pc
assay
that
would
quantitate
hiv
at
stanford,
he
arranged
for
dr.
holodniy
to
visit
cetus
in
order
to
learn
how
to
do
that.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
it
was
a
materials
transfer
agreement,
that's
right.
so
when
dr.
holodniy
went
there,
he
signed
a
separate
assignment,
the
one
that
assigned
his
inventions,
as
a
result
of
the
collaboration
or
as
a
consequence
of
the
collaboration,
to
cetus.
and
that
was
the
consideration.
to
this
day,
stanford
has
not
explained
what
cetus
could
have
done
to
protect
its
intellectual
property
so
that
it
could
have
been
able
to
practice
its
invention
without
having
to
go
to
stanford
for
a
license
and
pay
a
royalty.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
only
thing
under
stanford's
theory
that
cetus
could
have
done
is
told
dr.
holodniy
to
take
a
hike,
because
they
couldn't
have
any
assurance
that
his
employer
would
subsequently
say,
you
know
what?
there
was
a
thousand
dollars,
ten
dollars,
one
dollar
--
we
don't
know
--
of
federal
funding
under
an
agreement
that
has
never
been
produced,
that
is
of
indeterminate
scope,
and
they
suggest,
simply
by
averring
in
a
patent
application,
that
this
is
all
of
a
sudden
a
bayh-dole
invention,
even
though
it
was
--
indisputably
now,
under
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
conceived
before
dr.
holodniy
left
cetus
and
subject
to
this
agreement,
and
it
was
done
at
a
time
when
dr.
holodniy
was
being
paid
not
by
a
bayh-dole-related
grant,
but
by
a
national
research
service
award,
which
the
bayh-dole
expressly
exempts
from
its
provisions
in
section
212.
so
the
notion
that
cetus
somehow
has
lost
the
private
right
to
the
invention
conceived
using
its
proprietary
materials
and
information
simply
by
the
subsequent
use
of
an
unknown
amount
of
federal
funds,
that
that
works
as
a
divestiture--
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
--yes.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
this,
justice
ginsburg,
is
a
question
that
was
raised
in
front
of
the
federal
circuit.
the
federal
circuit
didn't
reach
it.
it
is
open
on
any
remand.
of
course,
we
don't
think
there
should
be
a
remand,
but
it's
certainly
not
before
this
court.
but
to
answer
the
question,
here's
the
record
on
this
point.
the
salary
was
not
paid
by
nih
grants.
it
was
paid
by
a
national
research
service
award
that
is
exempted.
the
grants
were
never
produced.
the
grant
titles,
on
their
face,
do
not
apply
to
the
work
that
was
done
at
stanford.
one
of
them
deals
with
establishing
a
center
for
aids
research.
of
course,
this
is
work
that
was
not
done
at
the
stanford
center;
it
was
done
at
cetus.
the
second
one
deals
with
aids
clinical
trials,
and
it's
undisputed
that
there
were
no
clinical
trials
at
cetus.
the
clinical
trials
only
happened
when
dr.
holodniy
went
back
to
stanford.
dr.
merigan's
declaration,
which
mr.
ayer
referenced
on
ja
98,
says
only
that
dr.
holodniy's
research
at
the
lab
at
stanford
was
covered
by
bayh-dole
act.
it
says
nothing
about
the
work
at
cetus.
and
if
there
was
any
doubt,
stanford
argued
repeatedly
to
the
federal
circuit
that
the
federally
funded
research
started
in
1990,
and
this
issue
was
decided
on
summary
judgment
against
roche
when
all
factual
inferences
should
have
taken
in
our
favor.
mr.
mark
c.
fleming
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
