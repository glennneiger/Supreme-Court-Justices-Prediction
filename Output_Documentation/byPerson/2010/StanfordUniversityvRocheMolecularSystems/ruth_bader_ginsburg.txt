justice

that
seems
to
be
a
factual
dispute,
so
maybe
you
can
be
clear
on
that.
according
to
cetus
or
roche,
at
the
time
that
this
scientist
came
to
cetus
to
work,
there
was
no
federal
funding;
that
that
federal
funding
for
this
project,
the
stanford
project,
came
about
after
the
scientist
had
spent
his
9
months
at
cetus.
at
least
that's
the
picture
that
--
that
they
draw,
that
the
federal
--
that
they
got
their
assignment
from
the
scientist
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
federally
funded
project.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ayer,
it
seems
the
federal
circuit
emphasized
a
distinction
between
the
scientist
saying
"i
will
assign",
which
was
the
language
used
in
the
agreement
with
stanford,
and
"i
hereby
do
assign",
and
it
seems
that
that
was
critical
to
the
--
to
the
federal
circuit's
decision.
they
say
--
they
cite
a
whole
bunch
of
cases.
the
suggestion
seems
to
be
that
if
stanford
had
said
"i
hereby
do
assign",
there
would
be
no
case
because
stanford
would
have
been
first
in
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
what
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case?
i
mean,
there
was
a
--
an
agreement,
a
standard
stanford
agreement,
that
said
i
will
assign
any
--
any
patent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
isn't
that
the
beginning
and
end
of
this
case?
i
mean
you
--
there
are
important
questions
presented.
but
the
federal
circuit
said
everything
turns
on
the
difference
between
"i
will
assign"
and
"i
hereby
assign".
cetus
would
have
come
second
in
time,
therefore
would
not
have
prevailed
over
stanford,
but
for,
except,
the
federal
circuit
said,
one
is
a
future
conveyance
and
one
is
an
immediate
conveyance.
you
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
whole
thing
that
was
wrong
here
is
that
stanford,
instead
of
drafting
the
agreement
"i
agree
to
assign",
should
have
said
"i
hereby
assign"
and
then
there
would
be
no
case.
is
that
--
the
cetus
agreement
said
"i
hereby
assign",
and
the
federal
circuit
said
for
that
reason,
even
though
it
was
second
in
time,
it
takes
precedence.
stanford
just
said
"i
will
assign".
so
if
stanford
had
instead
used
exactly
the
formula
that
cetus
used
--
"i
agree
to
assign
and
hereby
do
assign.
"
--would
you
have
any
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
the
cetus
agreement
that
came
second
in
time
had
said
"i
will
assign",
then
again,
you
would
have
no
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
--
we
have
a
number
of
sample
clauses
in
this
record,
and
some
say
"i
will
assign".
some
say
"i
hereby
do
assign".
the
notion
that
the
--
that
answer,
who
is
it
who
loses,
should
turn
on
whether
one
drafter
says
"i
agree
to
assign"
and
the
other
says
"i
hereby
assign"
does
seem
very
odd.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
we're
talking
about
nonexistent
property;
property
that
may
never,
in
fact,
exist?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
the
future,
the
universities
would
be
protected
against
a
third
party
simply
by
changing
the
form
of
contract
with
their
employees
to
say
"i
hereby
assign",
so
we
would
have
no
continuing
problem?
is
that
all
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
were
here,
mr.
fleming,
when
i
asked
mr.
ayer
about
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
not
--
so
that
the
federally
funded
project
existed
at
stanford
before
dr.
holodniy
ever
went
to
cetus?
