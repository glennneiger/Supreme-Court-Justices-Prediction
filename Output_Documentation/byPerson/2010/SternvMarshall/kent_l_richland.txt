mr.
kent
l.
richland
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
pierce
marshall
filed
a
claim
in
vickie
marshall's
bankruptcy
case.
he
alleged
he
was
damaged
because
she
falsely
accused
him
of
cheating
her
out
of
money
that
her
late
husband
intended
to
give
her.
in
order
to
preserve
its
claim
against
him,
the
bankruptcy
estate
had
no
choice
but
then
to
file
its
counterclaim
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
alleging
that
those
statements
were
in
fact
true,
and
that
far
from
pierce
being
entitled
to
money
from
the
estate,
he
owed
money
to
the
bankruptcy
estate.
this
court's
cases
established
that
the
bankruptcy
court
was
constitutionally
authorized
to
decide
that
entire
dispute.
congress
drafted
the
bankruptcy
statutes--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
this
court
has
never
approached
that
issue
directly.
of
course--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
of
course,
it
need
not
reach
that
in
this
case,
because
the
court
below
and
the
respondents
assume
for
te
purposes
of
this
case
that
in
fact
there
was
authority
for
the
bankruptcy--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
article
iii
of
course
is
not
jurisdictional
in
the
sense
that
we
think
of
basic
fundamental
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
it
can
be
waived,
of
course.
but
beyond
that,
i
think
that
marathon,
as
i
said,
assumes
that
there
is
article
iii
authority
to
adjudicate
the
proof
of
claim.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
okay.
and
--
well,
the
answer
is
that
under
--
under
the
various
theories
that
this
court
has
put
forth,
there
is
a
basis
for
the
bankruptcy
court
to
adjudicate
a
proof
of
claim.
one
theory,
of
course,
is
the
public
rights
theory,
and
in
granfinanciera
this
court
established
that
the
--
the
public
rights
theory
was
broader
than
just
the
kind
of
situation
where
the
government
was
a
party,
and
it
said
that
--
that
it
--
public
rights
are
defined
as
whether
congress
acting
under
article
i
has
created
a
seemingly
private
right
that
is
so
closely
integrated
into
a
public
regulatory
scheme
as
to
be
a
matter
appropriate
for
agency
resolution
with
limited
involvement
by
the
article
iii
judiciary.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
that's
--
that's
correct,
but
this
court
has
never
held
that
in
fact
the
claim
had
to
be
created
by
--
literally
created
by
congress.
what
this
court
has
always
talked
about
is,
is
--
is
the
claim
one
that
congress
has
established
as
being
applicable
within
the
system,
but
that
may
be
based
on
a
state
law
claim.
for
example,
when
this
court
analyzed
the
claims
which
were
at
issue
in
granfinanciera,
it
looked
at
the
fact
that
they
were
fundamental
common
law
claims.
it
didn't
depend
on
the
fact
that
they
were
federal
claims.
the
same
thing
was
--
is
true
in
the
way
that
the
--
that
this
court
analyzed
the
--
the
claim
in
--
in
marathon
itself.
it
made
the
determination
that
because
this
was,
i
think
the
way
justice
rehnquist
stated
it
was:
this
is
the
stuff
that
would
have
been
adjudicated
at
common
law
in
westminster
in
1789.
so
it
was
not
the
federal
or
state
nature
of
the
claim,
it
was
the
fact
that
these
were
common
law
claims
that
made
it
important.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
i
think
that
there
are
limits,
and
they
must
be
related
to
the
purpose
of
bankruptcy.
i
think
that,
that
a
--
that
sort
of
thing
would
be
related
to
perhaps,
within
the
"related
to"
jurisdiction
of
bankruptcy,
and
that
would
fall
within
the
problems
identified
in
granfinanciera,
for
example.
that
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
what
could
be
adjudicated
in
bankruptcy.
but
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
claims
and
counterclaims
that
are
at
the
essence
of
what
bankruptcy
courts
do.
the
bankruptcy
system,
of
course,
is
set
up
in
order
to
adjudicate
claims
to
a
limited
amount
of
money,
and
in
order
to
do
that
in
an
efficient
manner,
in
a
manner
that
will
not
utilize
the
entire
amount
of
the
--
the
estate
in
the
adjudication
process,
it
set
up
the
bankruptcy
courts.
and
so
they
are
set
up
in
order
to
be
efficient,
effective,
and
as
soon
as,
of
course,
as
we
get
an
article
iii
court
involved,
that
really
does
place
some
brakes
on
the
efficiency.
it
becomes
much
more
costly.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--well,
certainly
the
statute
--
157(b)(3)-2
--
does
not
distinguish
between
compulsory
and
permissive
counterclaims,
and
it's
also
true
that
this
court's
authority
in
granfinanciera,
in
langenkamp
and
in
katchen.
the
rationale
of
those
cases
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
permissive
counterclaims,
but
this
court
need
not
reach
that
issue
in
this
case,
because
here
we
do
have
--
what
both
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
what
seems
to
have
been
conceded
by
respondents
is,
indeed,
a
compulsory
counterclaim.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
is
an
excellent
justification
for
why
one
might
want
to
make
this
a
very
narrow
determination
in
this
case.
in
fact,
justice
rehnquist
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
marathon
said
that
this
is
an
area
which
is
very
touchy
and
difficult
and
complex,
and
it
is
one
where
we
particularly
should
not,
as
a
court,
go
beyond
the
facts
of
the
individual
case
and
what
must
be
decided
for
this
case.
of
course,
the
other
thing
about
compulsory
counterclaims
and
what
makes
it
more
applicable
in
this
kind
of
situation
in
an
article
iii
setting
is
that,
according
to
the
schor
analysis,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
how
much
of
an
intrusion
on
the
article
iii
process
are
we
talking
about.
and
if
we
assume,
as
appears
to
have
been
assumed
here,
that
the
claim
itself
may
be
determined
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
then
the
net
intrusion
by
determining
a
counterclaim,
a
compulsory
counterclaim,
is
much,
much
smaller,
because
there
almost
inevitably
will
be
overlap
between
what
must
be
decided
by
the
bankruptcy
court
and
what
--
on
the
claim,
and
what
must
be
on
the
counterclaim.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
kennedy.
but
in
fact,
what
happened
here
was
something
much,
much
more
than
just
a
motion,
a
request
for
determination
of
nondischargeability,
because
one
month
after
that
was
filed,
the
actual
proof
of
claim
itself
was
filed.
and
all
the
courts
below
have
uniformly
concluded
that
when
that
additional
step
is
taken,
it
could
have
no
purpose
other
than
to
present
the
claim
--
beyond
just
the
question
of
dischargeability,
present
the
question
of
liquidation
of
the
claim
to
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
that
is
correct.
some
weeks
after
the
proof
of
claim
was
filed,
the
counterclaim
was
filed.
the
objections
and
counterclaim
was
filed.
the
--
the
statutory
structure
here
is
something
that
--
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
is
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
that
in
fact
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
this
kind
of
treatment,
that
in
fact
there
is
a
two-step
process
by
which
one
determines
whether
a
bankruptcy
court
can
finally
decide
a
counterclaim.
but
i
think
that
really
is
belied
by
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
as
well
as
the
statutory
structure.
of
course,
the
starting
point
is
157(b)(2)(c),
which
very
clearly
and
straightforwardly
states
that
core
claims
include
counterclaims
by
the
estate
against
persons
filing
claims
against
the
estate.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
i
think
that
when
--
a
court
would
indeed,
if
one
were
looking
at
something
that
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
explicitly
mentioned
categories
from
(b)
to
(n)
in
157(b)(2),
one
would
in
fact
look
beyond
the
words
of
(a)
and
(o)
--
those
are
the
two
catch-all
provisions
--
and
one
would
look
to
the
usual,
normal
principles
of
statutory
construction
to
determine
what
fit
within
them.
but
152
--
157(b)(2)(c)
is
very
straightforward.
it
does
not
require
any
additional
interpretation.
there
is
--
a
counterclaim
against
a
person
filing
a
proof
of
claim
is
just,
on
its
face,
something
that
is
unambiguous.
and
the
fact
that
there
are
more
ambiguous
categories
there
would
probably
require
a
court
to
go
beyond,
you
know,
the
four
corners
of
the
statute
and
look
to
the
normal
kinds
of
principles
we
use
in
determining
what
statutes
mean.
we
would
look
at
the
categories
that
were
actually
included.
we
would
see,
is
this
something
that
is
similar,
does
it
fall
within
that
category,
and
so
on.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
that's
right.
the
--
(a)
and
(o)
are
very
broad.
and
so
what
--
that
category,
what
those
two
categories
would
have
to
be
informed
by
and
are
informed
by
are
the
principles
of
statutory
construction
that
are
normally
used.
and
included
among
those,
we
would
contend,
would
be
looking
at
the
words
of
the
statute
that
talk
about,
does
this
arise
under
the
bankruptcy
code
or
arise
in
a
bankruptcy
case.
so
for
those
particular
categories,
the
lower
courts
have
been
comfortable
with
the
idea
that
we
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
apply
those
words
and
use
those
as
limitations,
but
with
respect
to
the
specific
categories
from
(b)
to
(n),
the
courts
have
uniformly
indicated
that
those
categories
do
not
require
further
interpretation,
that
they
are
straightforward
and
they
constitute
core
proceedings
on
their
face.
i
think
the
--
with
respect
to
the
question
that
you
asked,
justice
sotomayor,
and
the
whole
issue
of
whether
a
matter
is
under
--
may
pass
muster
under
article
iii
is
a
very
easy
one
in
this
case.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
if
we
look
to
schor
and
schor's
article
iii
analysis,
we
can
see
that
it
really
divides
into
two
parts.
part
1
is,
was
there
some
--
is
the
article
iii
--
to
the
extent
the
article
iii
right
is
a
personal
one,
that
is
to
the
extent
that
it
guarantees
someone
a
--
a
decisionmaker
who
is
not
going
to
be
affected
by
the
political
branches
of
the
government
or
by
the
winds
of
politics,
that's
something
that's
waiveable.
and
in
fact--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--well,
justice
scalia,
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
addressed
in
footnote
14
in
granfinanciera.
it
explained
that,
yes,
waiver
under
many
circumstances
and
--
under
the
schor
case,
for
example,
waiver
involves
a
choice
between
two
equal
or
optional
options.
however,
i
should
point
out:
in
this
case,
there
was
another
option.
there
was
a
dischargeability
complaint
filed,
and
in
fact,
the
choice
was
made
not
to
pursue
that
but
instead
to
pursue
the
proof
of
claim.
there
was
already
a
state
court
suit
on
file
and,
instead
of
requesting
a
stay,
a
relief
from
the
bankruptcy
stay,
the
proof
of
claim
was
filed.
in
general,
however,
the
alexander
v.
hillman
principle,
which
is
also
discussed
in
footnote
14,
is
what
applies
in
this
--
in
this
circumstance.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
the
--
certainly
the
--
the
principles
of
--
of
permissive
abstention,
for
example,
encourage,
if
in
fact
comity
is
to
be
respected
and
if
there
is
another
suit
pending
elsewhere,
that
bankruptcy
courts
will
permit
the
suit
to
proceed
in
that
jurisdiction,
so
that
that
does
in
fact
occur.
but
it
was
never
even
tried
here,
and
that's
--
that's
really
would
be
the
point.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
point
before
i
sit
down
initially,
and
that
is,
if
this
court
should
decide
to
reverse,
that
as
we
requested
in
our
--
in
our
reply
brief
and
as
we
requested
in
our
relief
on
our
cross-appeal,
we
would
request
that
--
that
this
case
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court,
because
it
was
the
district
court
that
in
the
first
instance
applied
the
improper
standard,
and
we
think
that
would
be
an
appropriate
way
of
--
of
taking
care
of
this
case
in
this
instance.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
address
immediately
this
question
of
whether
judge
keller
effectively
denied
this
withdrawal
motion
on
timeliness
grounds
or
not,
because
that
truly
is
the
easy
way
of
resolving
this
personal
injury
question.
the
substantive
question
whether
these
particular
torts
fall
within
the
personal
injury
exception
is
a
most
difficult
one,
and
it
is
one
that
this
court
really
shouldn't
take
on
unless
there's
a
substantial
amount
more
of
briefing
and
input
from
--
from
others.
but
the
waiver
issue
is
an
easy
one,
and
the
reason
it's
an
easy
one
is
the
record
is
undisputed
that
it
was
27
months
between
the
time
that
this
claim
--
counterclaim
was
--
the
claim
was
filed
and
between
the
time
that
this
personal
injury
issue
was
raised
in
a
withdrawal
motion.
during
that
period
of
time
there
were
numerous
sanctions
motions,
and
numerous
sanctions,
discovery
sanctions
imposed
upon
pierce
marshall;
and
in
fact
what
happened
was
judge
keller,
before
considering
the
initial
withdrawal
motion
on
the
merits
--
before
having
a
hearing
on
it,
he
initially
granted
the
withdrawal.
he
then
had
a
hearing,
and
at
the
hearing
what
he
said
was
--
he
may
not
have
used
the
word
"timeliness",
but
what
he
said
is
you've
chosen
this
forum,
the
bankruptcy
court
is
immersed
in
this
case,
and
he
used
the
colorful
phrase
what
you
are
experiencing
here
is
the
spawn
of
what
you
have
begot.
and
i
think
that
that
clearly
imports
the
nature
that
you
are
too
late,
you
have
not
brought
this
in
a
timely
fashion;
everything
that
has
happened
in
the
bankruptcy
court
has
made
it
too
late
for
you
to
come
to
this
court
with
this--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--and
that--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--and
the
bankruptcy
court
is
so
immersed
in
this
because
of
what
has
gone
on
during
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
that
it
is
not
appropriate
for
me
to
withdraw
it.
that
seems
to
connote
clearly
the
notion
that
it
is
not
timely.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
and
that.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
well,
27
months
is
a
long
time
in
bankruptcy.
let
me
clear
up
this
issue
of
whether
the
counterclaim
was
to
the
proof
of
claim
or
to
the
dischargeability.
on
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
page
379,
it
is
quite
clearly
stated
that
it
was
in
response
to
170
--
157(b)(2)(c),
that
is
a
counterclaim
to
a
person
who
has
filed
a
claim.
on
--
with
respect
to
this
issue
of
state
law
having
some
great
significance
here
as
opposed
to
federal
law,
that
issue
has
been
rejected
by
this
court.
in
the
schor
case,
the
majority
opinion
states
very
clearly
that
in
fact
there
is
no
significance
to
the
fact
that
--
that
something
is
a
state
law
claim
as
opposed
to
a
federal
claim.
mr.
kent
l.
richland
there
is--
mr.
kent
l.
richland
--well,
i
understand
that
argument
but
the
majority
opinion
in
schor
states
that
the
state
law
character
of
a
claim,
quote,
"has
no
talismanic
power
in
article
iii
inquiries.
"
that's
478
at
853.
