justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
me
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
authority
at
all
for
a
bankruptcy
court
to
adjudicate
proof
of
claims,
without
violating
article
iii?
i
don't
think
we
have
ever
had
a
case
that's
actually
said
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
what's
the
constitutional
basis?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
how
that
helps.
if
there's
no
jurisdiction
for
the
bankruptcy
court
to
adjudicate
proof
of
claims,
then
how
can
it
adjudicate
counterclaims?
don't
both
fall
if
there's
an
article
iii
violation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
--
answer
the
question.
don't
assume.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
the
bankruptcy
court
adjudicate
permissive
counterclaims?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
if
you
posit
a
no,
what's
the
limiting
principle?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counselor,
that
sort
of
begs
the
question,
because
i
think
what
i
haven't
unpackaged
--
and
i
want
you
to
unpackage
it
with
me
--
you
are
obviously
not
deprived
of
a
state
or
federal
trial
forum
to
decide
your
claim.
what
you're
--
what
you're
deprived
of
--
you
can
get
your
judgment.
no
one's
telling
you,
you
can't
go
to
those
courts
and
get
a
declaration
of
your
rights.
what
you're
being
told
is
you
can't
get
paid
on
it.
but
that
happens
all
of
the
time,
either
by
the
vagrancies
of
the
fact
that
a
debtor
goes
bankrupt
and
doesn't
file
in
the
bankruptcy
court
or
does
file
and
there's
been
a
discharge.
what
you
haven't
said
to
me
is
what
entitles
you,
outside
of
equity,
and
what
stops
either
a
state
court
or
a
federal
--
a
state
legislature
or
a
congressional
legislature,
from
saying
when
someone
is
in
bankruptcy
this
is
the
res
and
these
are
the
people
who
are
entitled
to
it.
it's
a
separate
claim.
it's
not
the
state
law
claim.
it
may
be
measured
by
state
law
entitlement,
but
it's
a
separate
claim.
why
isn't
it
just
a
separate
claim?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
what
you
have
to
become
to
make
that
claim,
meaning
you
would
need
to
adjudicate
your
state
law
entitlement.
you
get
a
judgment
saying
she
defamed
you.
then
what
do
you
do
with
that
judgment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
--
that's
my
problem,
which
is
if
congress
could
do
that,
why
can't
it
do
what
it
did
here,
which
is
to
say
if
you
--
not
to
make
an
equitable
claim
against
the
estate.
it's
not
going
to
be
in
the
amount
of
your
judgment
because
they're
in
bankruptcy
because
they
can't
pay
your
judgment.
if
you
want
a
piece
of
this,
you
have
to
consent
to
all
claims,
all
compulsory
claims
--
let's
not
try
to
get
into
the
compulsory/permissive
category
--
to
be
adjudicated.
otherwise,
like
with
preferences,
there
is
an
unfairness
that
makes
this
unequitable.
you're
asking
the
estate
to
give
you
something,
but
you're
not
willing
to
submit
in
equity
to
deciding
whether
there's
something
you
should
give
the
estate
back.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
compulsorily.
i
mean,
you
know,
not
--
i'm
trying
to
take
the
permissive
issue
out.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
every
--
every
bankruptcy
priority
rule
extinguishes
someone's
entitlement
to
money.
the
security
rules
mean
the
people
who
have
secured
interests
get
paid
before
unsecured
people
get
paid,
and
there
are
insider
rules.
equity,
as
in
terms
of
how
the
bankruptcy
sets
up
the
rest,
is
at
the
vagrancies
of
the
legislature.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
choose
what
they're
going
to
permit
you
to
take
under
what
circumstances.
so
why
is
it
inequitable
to
--
to
force
you
--
not
to
--
to
force
you,
we'll
use
that
word
--
to
say
if
you
want
money
from
the
res,
what
you
trade
off
is
letting
the
debtor
sue
you
for
what
you
owe.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
have
a
constitutional
right
to
collect
your
debt.
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
your
claim
adjudicated
by
a
court.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
can
go
to
a
state
--
well,
once
you
get
the
stay
lifted
at
the
end
of
the
discharge,
you
could
sue
the
estate.
you
may
not
get
a
judgment
that
you
can
collect
after
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
without
a
proof
of
claim?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
by
your
theory,
you're
basically
saying
that
congress
cannot
delegate
any
state
law-based
claim
to
which
a
jury
is
entitled
to
the
bankruptcy
counterclaim
at
all.
so
if
you
have
a
claim
by
lawyers
for
their
fees
in
a
defense
of
malpractice,
maybe
they
can
adjudicate
that,
but
they
can't
adjudicate
the
malpractice
claim.
it
would
be
a
counterclaim.
correct?
