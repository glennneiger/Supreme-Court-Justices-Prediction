but
say
you
waive
it
when
--
when,
in
order
to
protect
yourself
for
a
debt
that
is
owed
to
you,
you
make
a
claim
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
we
do
have
a
doctrine
that
you
cannot
--
you
cannot
condition
a
federal
right
upon
the
waiver
of
constitutional
protections,
and
that
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
here:
if
you
want
to
get
paid
by
the
bankrupt
estate,
you
have
to
waive
your
--
your
right
to
a
--
to
a
jury
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
have
been
normal
for
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
lift
the
stay
with
respect
to
a
claim
that
could
be
presented
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
can't
be
right.
you
--
you
--
you
can
take
all
sorts
of
matters
that
belong
in
article
iii
courts,
and
so
long
as
you
place
them
in
some
other
tribunal
where
somebody
is
coerced
into
coming
in,
supposedly
voluntarily,
it's
all
okay.
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
not
an
adequate
protection.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
state
can
do
that,
but
can
the
federal
government
make
it
the
price
that
you
pay
for
--
for
going
into
a
non-article
iii
tribunal?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
different
situation,
it
seems.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
crowell
involved
public
rights
in
the
narrow
sense,
didn't
it?
it
was
a
public
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
there
should
be
different
standards.
even
if
you
do
not
agree
with
my
separate
opinion
in
granfinanciera
that
that
should
be
the
only
category,
there
may
well
be
different
standards
for
public
suits
in
the
narrow
sense
that
were
involved
in
crowell
and
public
suits
which
are
--
are
governed
by
some
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
did
all
of
those
court
of
appeals
cases
involve
article
iii
claims?
did
they
pass
upon
the
article
iii
contention?
if
not,
it's
--
it's
our
clear
law
that
the
questions
--
jurisdictional
questions
that
aren't
raised
and
discussed
are
not
decided
for
precedential
purposes.
how
--
how
many
of
those
cases
grappled
with
the
article
iii
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
most,
i
don't
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
would
take
that
to
mean
you
--
you
brought
it
in
here,
and,
you
know,
the
same
kind
of
argument
that
you
were
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you've
chosen
to
come
into
the
court,
and
this
is
the
spawn
of
your
coming
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
--
well,
i
would
rather
say
27
months
is
too
long.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
timely.
