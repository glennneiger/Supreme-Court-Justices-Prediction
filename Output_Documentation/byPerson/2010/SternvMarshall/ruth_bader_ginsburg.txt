mr.
richland,
isn't
there
this
difference:
just
to
take
ordinary
civil
procedure,
compulsory
counterclaim
doesn't
have
to
satisfy
any
jurisdictional
requirements,
because
it
comes
in
under
the
wing
of
the
main
claim,
but
a
permissive
counterclaim
has
to
independently
satisfy
jurisdictional
requirements.
so
that
could
be
a
reason,
even
though
the
bankruptcy
code
just
says
counterclaim,
to
distinguish
the
two.
if
there's
an
authority
to
deal
with
the
claim,
then
there's
authority
to
deal
with
the
counterclaim;
but
if
it's
a
permissive
counterclaim,
if
it's
not
based
on
the
same
transaction
or
premise,
then
it
would
have
to
be
a
self-standing
claim.
but,
as
you
--
as
you
have
said,
this
case
does
present
what
the
parties
have
agreed
is
a
compulsory
counterclaim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
counterclaim
came
at
what
point?
after
the
proof
of
claim
was
filed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
will
you
include
in
that
this
157(b)(5),
because
this
whole
thing
would
be
a
futile
exercise
if
the
tort
claim
comes
--
comes
out
of
the
bankruptcy
judge's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--does
the
government
have
a
position
on
what
the
answer
would
be
vis
a
vis
--
because
that's
an
open
question?
but
does
the
government
have
a
position
on
whether
these
kinds
of
claims
would
have
to
be
heard
by
an
article
iii
judge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
wanted
to
ask
you,
mr.
englert,
about
something
you
just
said
about
if
he
had
any
opportunity.
i
thought
his
position
was
this
is
a
nondischargeable
debt;
that
even
if
it's
discharged
in
bankruptcy,
this
debt
would
survive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
wouldn't
be
wiped
out?
i
mean,
it
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--he
would
have
another
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
one
more
point
about
the
nondischargeability.
he
didn't
have
to
bring
that
claim,
did
he?
i
mean,
if
it's
--
if
it's
a
nondischargeable
debt,
he
doesn't
have
to
have
the
bankruptcy
judge
confirm
that
it's
a
nondischargeability
debt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
of
course,
there
was
no
bankruptcy
court
handling
it
to
start
with.
there
was
no
claim.
if
you're
going
to
go
back
to
equity,
equity
lays
hold
of
a
claim
that
fits
within
the
equity
court,
and
then,
as
you
know,
there
were
clean-up
and
clear-up
doctrines
so
they
could
decide
the
whole
case.
so
i
think
that
the
one
thing
one
can
say
about
marathon
is
that
when
the
debtor
has
a
claim
against
the
creditor
and
the
creditor
hasn't
made
any
claim
in
the
bankruptcy,
he
can't
drag
that
into
the
bankruptcy
court.
but
once
the
bankruptcy
court
has
authority
over
the
claim,
the
creditor's
claim
against
the
debtor,
then
the
court
can
clear
up
the
whole
matter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
clarify
one
point,
mr.
englert.
as
i
understand
it,
before
the
code
was
amended,
when
the
federal
courts
were
operating
under
the
interim
rule,
it
was
standard
that
the
bankruptcy
judges,
given
a
claim
against
the
estate,
routinely
dealt
with
counterclaims.
isn't
that
what
the
practice
was
when
the
interim
rule
was
in
effect?
