mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
possible
grounds
for
affirmance
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
one
constitutional
and
two
statutory;
and
the
157(b)(5)
ground
which
was
preserved
below
received
some
discussion
at
the
very
end
of
mr.
stewart's
argument.
but
i
would
like
to
start
the
meat
of
my
argument
just
the
way
mr.
stewart
started
his
argument,
which
is
by
addressing
justice
scalia's
question;
and
like
mr.
richland,
i
would
like
to
talk
about
footnote
14
of
the
granfinanciera
opinion.
now,
granfinanciera
had
to
distinguish
schor,
which
is
the
only
case
in
which
this
court
has
ever
said
a
state
law
claim
could
be
a
public
right
so
that
it
can
be
adjudicated
by
a
non-article
iii
forum
and
not
subject
to
the
seventh
amendment.
and
schor
rested
on
a
consent
and
waiver
rationale
and
on
a
structural
rationale
that
an
alternative
article
iii
forum
was
made
available
by
congress
for
everyone
in
mr.
schor's
position.
in
distinguishing
schor,
this
court
said
in
footnote
14:
"parallel
reasoning
is
unavailable
in
the
context
of
bankruptcy
proceedings
because
creditors
lack
an
alternative
forum
to
the
bankruptcy
court
in
which
to
pursue
their
claims.
"
so
with
respect,
this
court
has
already
answered
the
question
justice
scalia
posed
by
saying
a
creditor
may
not
be
put
to
that
choice.
now,
the--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--okay,
justice
sotomayor,
in
attempting
to
answer
your
question
i
would
like
to
distinguish
sharply
between
a
claim
of
the
creditor
against
the
res--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that
judgment
then
is
covered
by
the
priority
scheme
of
federal
bankruptcy
laws
which
are
passed
pursuant
to
congressional
authority
--
constitutional
authority
in
article
i,
section
8,
clause
4,
which
is
why,
in
answer
to
the
question
your
honor
asked
first
of
mr.
richland,
although
the
court
has
never
squarely
addressed
it,
it's
broadly
accepted
that
there
is
no
problem
with
adjudicating
what
would
otherwise
be
state
law
claims
by
the
creditor
against
the
debtor
in
bankruptcy.
it's
an
entirely
different
subject
when
the
debtor
tries
to
bring
a
claim
against
the
creditor.
that's
what
marathon
addressed;
that's
what
granfinanciera
addressed;
that's
what
katchen
v.
landy
addressed.
now,
in
katchen
v.
landy,
the
court
said
the
case
turned
on
or
largely
turned
on
the
proposition
that
congress
had
prescribed
that
the
counterclaim,
the
preference
avoidance
counterclaim
created
by
act
of
congress,
must
be
adjudicated
before
the
main
claim
against
the
res
and
against
the
debtor
could
or
couldn't
be
disallowed.
and
the
court
returned
to
that
view
in
footnote
14
of
granfinanciera
saying:
"as
katchen
makes
clear,
however,
by
submitting
a
claim
against
the
bankruptcy
estate,
creditors
subject
themselves
to
the
court's
equitable
power
to
disallow
those
claims.
"
so
to
the--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--and
--
and--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--sure.
and
the
answer,
i
really
do
submit,
is
footnote
14
of
granfinanciera,
pointing
out
that
there
is
nowhere
else
to
go
for
a
creditor
in
bankruptcy,
which
distinguishes
bankruptcy
from
schor
in
particular,
but
from
all
the
other
settings
in
which
the
court
has
said
that
by
submitting
a
claim
you
subject
yourself
to
the
jurisdiction
for
all
purposes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
if
it's
inequitable
but
it's
certainly
unconstitutional;
and
the
reason
it's
unconstitutional
is
because--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--with
respect--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--with
respect
to
the
claim
of
the
creditor
against
the
debtor
and
against
the
res,
i
have
no
problem
with
that
analysis.
when
the
debtor,
instead
of
saying
the
res
is
limited
and
it
can
only
be
distributed
so
far,
instead
says,
i
get
to
bring
my
counterclaim
against
the
creditor
in
a
non-article
iii
forum
and
the
non-article
iii
forum
gets
to
hear
it
and
determine
it,
not
just
hear
as
157(c)(1)
says
for
certain
types
of
claims
--
then
i
suggest
there
is
a
constitutional
problem,
at
least
with
respect
to
claims
that
neither,
as
in
katchen
v.
landy,
require
rejection
of
the
main
claim,
nor,
as
in
katchen
v.
landy,
are
governed
by
federal
statute.
this
is
a
state
common
law
action
for
a
tort,
which
has
importance
for
157(b)(5),
which
has
importance
for
157(b)(2),
and
which
has
extremely
high
importance
for
the
constitutional
question.
in
marathon,
as
everyone
here
knows,
there
was
no
majority
opinion,
but
one
point
very
much
in
common
between
the
plurality
and
the
concurrence
of
justice
--
then-justice
rehnquist,
was
that
it
mattered
a
great
deal
that
it
was
a
common
law
claim
under
state
law.
here
we
have
a
common
law
claim--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes.
there
was
no
proof
of
claim
in
marathon,
so
this
case
presents
a
different
issue
than
marathon
does.
but
it
does
present,
categorically,
the
same
kinds
of
issues
presented
in
katchen,
langenkamp,
and
schor.
the
only
one
of
those
cases
that
allowed
a
state
common
law
claim
to
go
forward
--
a
state
common
law
counterclaim
to
go
forward
was
schor.
and
the
court,
as
mr.
richland
correctly
said,
divided
its
opinion
into
a
part
dealing
with
the
personal
rights
conferred
by
article
iii,
section
1,
and
the
structural
rights
protected
by
article
iii,
section
1.
in
the
part
about
personal
rights,
the
court
held
mr.
schor
had
waived
his
personal
right
to
an
article
iii
forum.
in
the
part
about
structural
rights
at
page
855
of
that
opinion,
the
court
said
that
it
mattered
to
the
constitutional
analysis
that
congress
had
made
an
article
iii
forum
available
for
pursuit
of
that
claim.
so
it
is
terribly,
terribly
important
whether
an
article
iii
forum
is
available.
when
one
is
forced
into
a
non-article
iii
forum,
as
pierce
marshall
was,
if
he
wanted
to
have
any
opportunity
to
collect
from
the
res,
saying
that
he
thereby
in
some
meaningful
way
consents
and
saying
that
the
structural
purposes
of
article
iii
are
not
implicated
is
not
in
line
with
this
court's
cases.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
oh
--
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
he
would
have
another
forum
against
her
post-bankruptcy
assets
after
she
had
her
--
her
pre-bankruptcy
assets
distributed.
so
it's
a
--
it's
a
different
kind
of
opportunity
to
recover
from
a
different
set
of
assets.
if
he
wanted
to
have
any
shot
at
any
of
her
prebankruptcy
assets,
he
did
have
to
file
a
proof
of
claim
and
not
just
a
nondischargeability
complaint.
let
me
clear
up
one
very
minor
aspect
of
the
record
while
i'm
talking
about
the
proof
of
claim
and
the
nondischargeability
complaint.
i
doubt
this
ends
up
mattering
to
the
court's
decision,
but
mr.
richland
misspoke
slightly
when
he
said
the
counterclaim
came
weeks
after
the
proof
of
claim.
the
proof
of
claim
was
june
12th.
the
counterclaim
was
june
14th,
and
in
its
very
first
paragraph
it
says
it
is
a
counterclaim
to
the
nondischargeability
complaint.
it
doesn't
purport
to
be
a
counterclaim
to
the
proof
of
claim.
i
doubt
this
ends
up
mattering,
but
it
might
be
important
for
this
single
purpose:
it
is
inconceivable
that
this
was
a
compulsory
counterclaim
to
the
nondischargeability
complaint.
it
might
have
been
a
compulsory
counterclaim
to
the
proof
of
claim,
but
not
to
the
nondischargeability
complaint.
now,
i've
explained
why
i
believe--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--given
--
i
haven't
studied
closely
the
interaction
between
the
automatic
stay
of
section
362
and
the
nondischargeability
complaint
of
section
523,
so
i'm
not
100
percent
sure
my
answer
to
your
honor
is
correct.
but
i
believe
that's
not
correct.
i
believe
that
in
order
to
preserve
the
argument
that
something
is
nondischargeable,
one
does
have
to
go
to
the
bankruptcy
court
under
section
523
and
seek
the
determination
of
nondischargeability.
now,
the
two
statutory
arguments
are
before
the
court,
and
i
would
like
to
say
something
briefly
about
each
of
those
two
statutory
arguments.
with
regard
to
157(b)(2),
you
have
heard
mr.
richland
say
this
afternoon
that
the
lower
courts
limit
subparagraphs
(a)
and
(o)
with
the
language
"arising
in"
and
"arising
under".
you
heard
mr.
richland
say
157(b)(2)(c),
subparagraph
(c),
doesn't
need
to
be
so
limited
because
it's
so
straightforward,
but
the
point
is
not
how
straightforward
it
is.
the
point
is
how
broad
and
constitutionally
dubious
it
is.
and
if
the
canon
of
constitutional
avoidance
means
anything
in
limiting
the
scope
of
157(b)(2),
it
should
have
just
as
much
application
to
(c)
as
it
does
to
(a)
and
(o),
and
the
--
it
is
not
as
analytically
neat
as
some
other
cases
of
statutory
interpretation,
but
the
most
obvious
way
one
is
going
to
limit
the
reach
of
(c),
as
well
as
(a)
and
(o),
to
do
so
is
to
take
the
words
mr.
richland
concedes
they
are
used
in
limiting
(a)
and
(o).
the
alternative
is
to
treat
those
words
as
surplusage,
and
the
alternative
is
to
run
headlong
into
the
constitutional
issues.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
no,
justice
breyer,
i
think
i
can
agree
with
most
or
all
of
your
premises
and
still
argue
that
we
should
win
under
the
proper
constitutional
analysis.
the
point
is
not
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
schor
said
in
so
many
words
that
the
availability
of
an
alternative
article
iii
forum
is
dispositive.
the
point
is,
it
has
to
be
dispositive,
given
the
larger
sweep
of
this
court's
cases,
because
otherwise
it
is
simply
an
all-factors
test
governing
a
structural
provision
of
the
constitution.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
those,
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
believe
are
the
arguments
that
were
rejected
in
marathon.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
in
marathon,
in
northern
pipeline
v.
marathon.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
saying
marathon
makes
this
case
a
slam-dunk
for
me,
justice
breyer.
i
am
saying
marathon
rejects
many,
if
not
all,
of
the
premises
of
your
question,
starting
with--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
i'm
suggesting
that
they
reject
one
particular
interpretation
of
crowell,
a
very
broad
interpretation
of
crowell.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
correct.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
--
i
agree
with
that
--
excuse
me,
justice
scalia.
i
do
agree
with
that,
and
i
think
one
doesn't
have
to
adopt
the
reasoning
of
the
concurrence
in
the
judgment
in
granfinanciera
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
i
think
part
four
of
granfinanciera
itself
supports
that
proposition.
but
i
also
think
--
returning
to
justice
breyer's
question,
i
do
think
that
marathon
does
stand
for
certain
propositions
that
this
court
has
accepted
in
later
cases
and
that
--
and
that
do
suggest
that
crowell
is
not
to
be
read
broadly
and
that
some
of
the
limitations
on
crowell
are
the
ones
suggested
in
justice
scalia's
questions.
the
--
the
thing
that
the
concurrence,
the
two-justice
concurrence
in
marathon,
agreed
with
the
plurality
on
was
that
what
was
fundamental
to
the
disposition
of
that
case
was
that
the
claim
by
the
debtor
against
the
creditor
was
the
stuff
of
common
law
at
westminster
in
1789.
it
was
a
state
law
claim,
not
by
the
creditor
against
the
debtor,
but
by
the
debtor
against
the
creditor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
all
we
were
talking
about,
justice
ginsburg,
were
doctrines
of
equity,
then
perhaps
alexander
v.
hillman
would
be
the
governing
precedent,
a
non-constitutional
case
later
cited
in
a
seventh
amendment
case
and
now
attempted
to
be
imported
into
an
article
iii
case.
but
i
do
respectfully
suggest
that
the
constitution
places
tighter
limits
on
the
authority
of
non-article
iii
tribunals
to
adjudicate
counterclaims
than
just
the
general
and
very
permissive
rules
that
allowed
equity
courts
to
adjudicate
counterclaims
without
--
alexander
v.
hillman
was
a
case
about
a
whole
equity
rule
30
and
whether
it
superseded
section
51
of
the
judicial
code
and
its
venue
provisions
and
personal
jurisdiction
provisions.
if
all
we
were
talking
about
would
be
equity,
that
would
be
a
fine
analysis.
but
i
do
read
the
collection
of
this
court's
cases,
including
the
crucial
decisions
in
katchen
and
langenkamp
which
involved
federal
counterclaims
that
by
statute
defeated
the
main
claim,
and
schor,
which
i
do
believe
relied
heavily
on
the
consent
theory
and
on
the
availability
of
an
article
iii
forum.
i
do
read
that
collection
of
cases
to
suggest
that
there
are
tighter
limits
on
assigning
state
law
claims
and
state
law
counterclaims
to
non-article
iii
tribunal--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
am
saying
that,
your
honor,
but
let
me
say
for
a
moment
why
that's
not
inefficient,
why
that's
not
such
a
surprising
proposition.
remember,
the
bankruptcy
court
can
hear
all
of
these
claims
unless
they're
covered
by
157(b)(5).
it
just
can't
determine
them.
so,
the
only
thing
we're
talking
about
is
the
standard
of
review.
and
with
respect
to
--
it's
not
a
surprising
proposition
that
the
requirement
of
an
article
iii
forum
does
require
that
the
district
court,
the
article
iii
court,
decide
those
claims.
so
--
so
the
--
my
position
is
as
broad
as
your
honor's
question
suggests,
but
the
implications
are
not
quite
as
broad
as
mr.
richland
suggested
when
he
said
that
an
article
iii
forum
always
brings
in
inefficiency.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
--
i
would
respectfully
subject
--
suggest
not,
justice
kagan,
because
there
remains
a
difference
between
a
non-article
iii
court
and
an
article
iii
court,
and
the
degree
of
supervision
does
not
convert
the
non-article
iii
court
into
an
article
iii
court.
it
simply
means
that
we've
gotten
to
this
non-article
iii
forum
in
a
way
that
gives
slightly
tighter
control
to
the
judiciary.
but
as
a
whole
line
of
cases,
including
crowell
v.
benson,
suggests,
the
degree
of
substantive
review
of
individual
decisions
by
non-article
iii
tribunals
matters.
it's
not
just
the
front
end
at
which
the
judges
or
commissioners
or
whatever
they
are
of
the
non-article
iii
tribunal
are
selected.
it's
also
the
back
end
at
which
the
article
iii
forum
is
either
really
making
the
article
iii
decisions
or
giving
deferential
review
to
the
decisions
of
a
non-article
i
court.
so
i
do
think
the
problem
is
not
solved
simply
by
a
different
method
of
appointment
of
--
of
bankruptcy
courts.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
spend
a
few
minutes
on
section
157(b)(5).
it
was
interesting
to
me
that
mr.
stewart
said
the
government
had
no--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
--
i
believe
the
answer
is
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
i
can
concede
that
point.
but
there
was,
i
believe,
de
novo
review
in
district
court.
and
in
any
event,
the
interim
rules
were
in
effect
for
a
very
short
time
as
the
arc
of
constitutional
decision-making
goes.
marathon
was
decided
in
1982,
congress
passed
new
legislation
in
1984,
and
it
took
quite
sometime
for
the
interim
rules
to
be
put
into
effect.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
have
a
case
count
for
you,
justice
scalia.
some
did,
i
must
concede
that
some
did,
but
certainly
not
all
did.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
not
most,
and
they
were
only
decisions
of
the
lower
courts,
not
of
this
court.
now,
on
the
personal
injury
tort
provision
in
section
157(b)(5),
which,
by
the
way,
is
also
repeated
in
157(b)(2)(b)
and
in
157(b)(2)(o)
to
give
emphasis
to
the
fact
that
congress
really
did
not
want
bankruptcy
judges
trying
personal
injury
tort
claims.
the
--
the
greatest
dispute
before
this
court
is
not
whether
we
are
right
about
157(b)(5).
mr.
richland
in
his
--
in
his
reply
brief
says
we're
not
right,
but
i
leave
the
court
to
assess
those
arguments;
and
mr.
stewart
takes
no
position.
the
greatest
dispute
is
whether
that
issue
was
preserved
for
review.
and
i
want
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
was
clearly
preserved
for
review.
in
the
proof
of
claim
filed
on
june
12th,
1996,
mr.
marshall,
pierce
marshall,
checked
the
box
indicating
that
he
was
filing
a
personal
injury
tort
claim,
so
from
literally
the
first
document
that
potentially
brought
this
issue
before
the
bankruptcy
court,
it
was
noted
that
it
was
a
personal
injury
tort
claim.
twenty-seven
months
passed
before
he
moved
to
withdraw
the
reference,
that's
true.
what's
not
true
is
that
anything
had
happened
on
the
defamation
claim
during
those
27
months;
and
what's
not
true
is
that
any
court
below
held
that
delay
against
pierce
marshall.
if
you
look
at
pages
109
to
112
of
the
joint
appendix
filed
in
this
court,
you
will
see
that
the
timeliness
of
the
motion
to
withdraw
the
reference
was
actually
discussed
in
the
motion
itself.
that's
a
matter
easily
accessible
to
this
court.
judge
keller
granted
the
motion
to
withdraw
the
reference.
he
said:
pierce
marshall,
you're
right.
then
he
reversed
himself.
and
you
can
find
his
ruling
reversing
himself
at
pages
138
to
139
of
the
joint
appendix
filed
in
this
court,
but
he
did
not
reverse
himself
on
timeliness
grounds.
our
respectful
submission
is
that
by
granting
the
motion
and
then
reversing
on
other
grounds
he
clearly
accepted
its
timeliness.
in
any
event,
the
issue
was
clearly
raised
in
the
bankruptcy
court
and
in
the
district
court--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--he
concluded
that
the
bankruptcy
court
actually
did
have
authority
to
hear
the
claim
and
the
counterclaim
on
the
merits.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
given
the
premise
that
i've
lost
every
other
issue,
the
court
could
either--
[laughter]
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
no,
i
understand.
i
understand.
but
given
the
premise,
the
court
could
then
either
then
reach
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance,
which
is
well
within
the
ordinary
operation
of
this
court's
rules
or
send
it
back.
but
let
me
suggest
that
there
is
a
reason,
and
i
believe
a
--
a
--
a
question
from
a
member
of
the
bench
earlier
suggested
that
there
might
be
a
reason
to
reach
the
157(b)(5)
issue,
and
to
put
it
colloquially
and
directly,
the
157(b)(5)
issue
is
easy.
the
constitutional
question--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--is
easy.
the
constitutional
question
is
hard.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
but
really,
the
157(b)(5)
question
is
--
is
easy,
but
the
strongest
argument
mr.
richland
makes
on
the
merits
of
the
157(b)(5)
claim
is
that
congress
meant
only
bodily
injury
when
it
referred
to
personal
injury.
but
section
522(d)(11)
of
the
code
uses
the
term
"bodily
injury",
so
we
know
that
when
congress
means
bodily
injury,
it
says
bodily
injury.
it's
also
been
suggested
that
the
phrase
"personal
injury
or
wrongful
death"
is
a
phrase
to
which
the
canons
of
interpretation
"noscitur
a
sociis"
and
"ejusdem
generis"
somehow
apply.
that's
not
why
congress
used
personal
injury
or
wrongful
death.
until
1846
with
lord
campbell's
act,
the
common
law
of
england
was
that
a
wrongful
death
claim
didn't
survive,
couldn't
be
brought
by
the
--
by
the
heirs,
because
the
victim
of
the
tort
was
dead.
it
is
quite
common
all
around
the
country
to
use
the
phrase
"personal
injury
or
wrongful
death"
to
make
clear
that
the
tort
being
covered
is
a
tort
that
resulted
in
injury
to
someone
who
survived
or
is
a
tort
that
resulted
in
death.
so
there's
nothing
surprising
about
the
use
of
that
phrase.
it
doesn't
mean
bodily
injury.
and
for
those
who
look
at
legislative
history,
there
is
legislative
history
indicating
quite
emphatically
that
the
members
of
congress
who
were
responsible
for
adding
157(b)(5),
amending
157(b)(2)(b),
amending
157(b)b-o
--
and
putting
the
abstention
provisions
in
section
1334(c)
really
meant
for
bankruptcy
judges
to
keep
their
hands
off
personal
injury
claims.
the
main
claim
in
this
case
that
conceivably
could
have
given
the
bankruptcy
court
jurisdiction,
if
i
lose
on
the
other
issues,
was
pierce's
defamation
claim,
not
vickie's
intentional
interference
claim.
we
would
respectfully
suggest
they're
both
personal
injury
tort
claims,
but
it's
particularly
clear
that
pierce's
defamation
claim
is
an
injury
to
his
personal
interest
in
reputation.
so
either
by
resolving
the
constitutional
issue
or
through
the
canon
of
constitutional
avoidance,
or
simply
because
it
is
the
best
reading
of
157(b)(2),
this
court
should
affirm
the
ninth
circuit.
thank
you.
