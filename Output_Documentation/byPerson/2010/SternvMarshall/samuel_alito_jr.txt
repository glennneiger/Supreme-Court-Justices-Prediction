justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
claim
here
was
not
one
that
was
created
by
congress,
though,
was
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
--
that
(b)(2)
says
core
proceedings
include,
but
are
not
limited
to,
the
matters
that
are
listed
after
that?
how
would
a
court
go
about
deciding
whether
something
that
is
not
specifically
mentioned
constitutes
a
core
proceeding
except
by
looking
back
to
(b)(1),
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
think
is
the
principle
that
defines
a
core
proceeding?
some
of
these
specifically
enumerated
items
are
very
--
potentially
very
broad.
(a),
"matters
concerning
the
administration
of
the
estate.
