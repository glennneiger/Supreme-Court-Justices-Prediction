is
there
any
authority
--
this
began
as
a

justice
anthony

is
there
--
is
there
--
are
there
any
cases
in
the
federal
courts
which
tell
us
that
a
motion
for
nondischargeability
does
or
does
not
require
the
pleading
of
a
counterclaim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
because
there's
a
basic
sovereign
immunity.
the
government
doesn't
have
to
be
sued
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
it
can
--
so
it
can
make
conditions,
but
that's
not
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
because
of
the
limitation
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
you
don't
--
and
you
don't
have
that
analogue
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy

me,
i
just
couldn't
hear.

what
grounds
did
he
reverse
himself,
do
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
--
is?
