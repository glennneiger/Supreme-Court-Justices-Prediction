we
will
now
hear
argument
in
case
10-179,
stern
v.

mr.

chief

john
g.
roberts,

thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
a
little
--
it's
a
little
different
when
you're
talking
about
the
right
to
have
a
--
a
decision
before
an
article
iii
tribunal.
it
seems
a
bit
more
fundamental
than
the
examples
you're
giving.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
not
--
not
fundamental
in
the
sense
of
is
it
important
or
not.
i
guess
that
--
"fundamental"
is
not
the
right
word.
maybe
"structural"
or
--
or
something
like
that.
it's
sort
of
the
whole
basis
for
the
decision
that's
going
to
be
made.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
just
means
that
the
district
court
is
acting
in
concert
with
congress
to
take
action
that
undermines
the
long-term
institutional
and
constitutional
basis
of
the
judiciary,
and
the
districts
courts
have
very
different
reasons
and
incentives
to
do
that.
that
doesn't
mean
that
all
bets
are
off,
and
just
because
they're
involved
in
the
process
it's
not
a
concern.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
englert.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
richland,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel;
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
number
10-179.
the
very
caption
of
the
case
gives
you
an
idea
of
what
is
in
store,
the
case
of
stern,
executor
of
the
estate
of
marshall,
versus
marshall,
executrix
of
the
estate
of
marshall.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
like
something
out
of
a
19th
century
dickens
novel.
the
litigation
has
been
going
on
for
over
15
years.
the
original
parties
have
each
died
and
have
been
replaced
by
their
executors.
to
avoid
confusion,
i'll
refer
to
the
original
parties
rather
than
their
executors
and
by
their
first
names
since
everyone
in
the
case
is
named
marshall.
the
case
has
worked
its
way
through
state
and
federal
courts
in
louisiana,
texas
and
california.
it
has
even
been
to
this
case
before
we
sent
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
after
argument
and
decision
on
an
unrelated
question
only
to
find
it
before
us
again.
the
underlying
facts
have
a
fascination
of
their
own.
petitioner
vickie
lynn
marshall,
better
known
perhaps
as
anna
nicole
smith
was
26
when
she
married
the
89-year
old
jay
howard
marshall
ii.
jay
howard
had
a
fortune
estimated
to
be
worth
as
much
as
$2
billion.
he
died
a
little
more
than
a
year
after
his
marriage
to
vickie
but
did
not
provide
for
her
in
his
will.
vickie
claimed
that
pierce
marshall,
jay
howard's
son
from
a
prior
marriage
had
fraudulently
prevented
jay
howard
from
leaving
her
roughly
half
of
his
fortune
which
vickie
said
is
what
jay
howard
wanted
to
do.
shortly
after
jay
howard
died,
vickie
filed
for
bankruptcy
in
federal
court.
pierce
filed
a
claim
in
that
bankruptcy
proceeding
asserting
that
vickie
owed
him
money
for
defamation
because
of
statements
by
her
attorneys
about
his
alleged
fraud.
vickie
responded
with
a
counterclaim
against
pierce
arguing
that
those
statements
were
true
and
that
he
was
liable
to
her
under
texas
state
law
prohibiting
interference
with
an
intended
gift.
the
bankruptcy
court
held
a
trial
and
eventually
entered
a
final
judgment
awarding
vickie
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
on
her
counterclaim.
shortly
after
that
however,
a
texas
state
probate
court
that
was
considering
the
same
issues
in
the
context
of
a
suit
over
jay
howard's
will,
ruled
in
pierce's
favor.
now
which
of
those
conflicting
judgments
controls
and
whether
vickie,
her
estate
of
course,
gets
to
keep
those
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
depends
on
whether
the
bankruptcy
court
have
the
authority
to
enter
a
final
judgment
on
vickie's
counterclaim.
there
are
two
parts
to
that
question.
first,
does
the
bankruptcy
code
authorize
a
bankruptcy
judge
to
enter
a
final
judgment
on
that
sort
of
claim?
the
answer
turns
out
to
depend
on
resolving
several
arcane
issues
of
statutory
interpretation.
after
doing
that,
we
conclude
that
yes,
the
bankruptcy
code
does
authorize
the
bankruptcy
courts
to
do
what
the
court
did
hear.
that
brings
us
to
the
second
part
of
the
question.
does
the
constitution
allow
a
bankruptcy
judge
to
enter
a
final
judgment
on
a
claim
such
as
vickie's?
although
the
history
of
this
litigation
is
complicated,
the
answer
to
that
question
turns
on
very
basic
and
very
important
constitutional
principles.
we
go
back
to
the
beginning.
article
iii
of
the
united
states
constitution
commands
that,
“the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
be
vested
in
one
supreme
court
and
in
such
inferior
courts
as
the
congress
may
from
time
to
time
ordain
and
establish.”
that
same
article
provides
that
the
judges
of
the
federal
courts,
the
ones
who
exercise
that
judicial
power,
shall
hold
their
offices
during
good
behavior
without
any
decrease
in
their
salaries.
now,
article
iii
plays
an
important
role
in
the
system
of
checks
and
balances
that
the
framers
adopted
in
the
constitution.
ms.
hamilton
explained
in
the
federalist
papers
quoting
montesquieu,
“there
is
no
liberty
if
the
power
of
judging
be
not
separated
from
the
legislative
and
executive
powers.”
the
single
most
original
feature
of
the
constitution
was
this
taking
of
judicial
power
away
from
the
executive
and
legislative
authorities
and
placing
it
in
a
separate
judiciary.
article
iii
then
goes
on
to
ensure
the
independence
of
that
judiciary
through
lifetime
tenure
and
protection
against
diminution
of
salary.
one
of
the
charges
against
king
george
iii
in
the
declaration
of
independence
was
that
he
had,
“may
judges
dependent
on
his
will
alone
for
the
tenure
of
their
offices
and
the
amount
and
payment
of
their
salaries.”
article
iii
was
designed
to
ensure
that
nothing
like
that
would
happen
under
the
new
government.
now,
all
this
would
be
meaningless
if
the
other
branches
were
allowed
to
take
judicial
power
away
from
the
article
iii
courts.just
as
the
president
would
object
if
we
purported
the
veto
bills
that
congress
sent
to
him
or
congress
would
protest
if
we
claimed
the
right
to
rule
on
confirmation
of
the
president's
nominees
for
office,
we
must
object
if
the
other
branches
take
away
--
away
the
work
that
is
assigned
to
us
under
the
constitution.
that
work,
what
we
have
described
as
resolution
of
the
mundane
as
well
as
the
glamorous,
matters
of
common
law
and
statute
as
well
as
constitutional
law,
issues
of
fact
as
well
as
issues
of
law
belong
to
the
article
iii
judiciary.
bankruptcy
judges
are
very
capable
and
dedicated
jurists
who
perform
a
vital
legal
function
but
they
are
not
article
iii
judges.
they
do
not
have
the
constitutionally
required
protections.
the
question
is
the
narrow
but
important
one
of
whether
they
may
nonetheless
decide
and
in
their
final
judgment
on
claims
such
as
vickie's.
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
bankruptcy
court
exercised
article
iii
judicial
power
in
this
case.
vickie's
claim
was
a
bread
and
butter
legal
claim
based
on
state
tort
law.
the
facts
were
a
bit
exotic
but
resolution
of
the
claim
clearly
called
for
the
normal
exercise
of
judicial
power
and
if
the
case
is
in
the
federal
system,
that
means
by
an
article
iii
court.
certain
exceptions
to
this
rule
have
developed
over
the
years.
one
that
vickie
relied
on
in
this
case
is
the
so-called
public
rights
exception.
there's
been
a
lot
of
debate
over
the
exact
reach
of
that
exception
but
generally
speaking
it
utmost
may
allow
decisions
by
non-article
iii
bodies
where
a
party's
claim
is
closely
related
to
actions
taken
by
the
federal
government
or
tied
up
in
a
federal
regulatory
scheme.
vickie's
counterclaim,
which
was
based
on
state
law
and
existed
outside
of
her
bankruptcy
is
not
such
a
claim.
vickie
also
point
out
that
in
past
cases
we
have
upheld
adjudication
by
entities
outside
article
iii
when
those
entities
were
functioning
as
what
we
call
an
adjunct
to
the
article
iii
courts.
but
the
bankruptcy
courts
are
not
adjuncts,
quite
the
opposite.
under
the
current
statute,
bankruptcy
courts
may
rule
on
any
issue
that
a
party's
counterclaim
might
present
and
for
counterclaims
like
vickie's,
they
issue
what
purport
to
be
final
binding
orders.
we
conclude
today
that
the
bankruptcy
court
exceeded
article
iii.
it
did
so
only
in
one
small
particular.
our
ruling
is
accordingly
very
narrow
and
we
think
will
not
have
a
great
impact
on
the
bankruptcy
system.
we're
not
talking
about
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
generally.
we
address
only
counterclaims
such
as
vickie's
which
do
not
arise
out
of
federal
bankruptcy
law
and
are
not
resolved
by
a
ruling
on
a
creditor's
claim.
the
bankruptcy
law
already
provides
that
state
and
federal
district
courts
will
hear
and
resolve
other
types
of
state
law
claims
connected
to
bankruptcy
proceedings.
and
we
do
not
think
it
meaningfully
changes
the
division
of
labor
under
that
statute
to
require
the
same
in
this
case.
bankruptcy
courts
may
still
issue
decisions
in
such
cases.
they
simply
may
not
be
final
judgments.
that
authority
rests
with
the
article
iii
district
courts
reviewing
the
bankruptcy
court
recommended
decisions.
now,
this
is
not
a
case
where
we
are
concerned
that
congress
and
the
executive
are
maliciously
trying
to
strip
us
of
power,
not
at
all.
but
a
statute
however
innocent
may
no
more
chip
away
at
the
authority
of
the
judicial
branch
then
it
may
eliminate
it
entirely.
we
cannot
compromise
the
integrity
of
the
system
of
separated
powers
and
the
role
of
the
judiciary
in
that
system
even
with
respect
to
challenges
that
at
first
may
seem
harmless.
we
conclude
that
the
bankruptcy
court
did
not
have
the
constitutional
authority
to
enter
final
judgment
on
vickie's
counterclaim.that
means
that
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
which
reversed
the
award
of
damages
to
vickie.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
sotomayor
and
kagan
joined.
