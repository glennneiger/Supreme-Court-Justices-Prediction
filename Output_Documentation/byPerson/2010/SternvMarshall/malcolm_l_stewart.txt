mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
--
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
--
what
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine,
whether
its's
appropriate
to
place
a
person
in
a
position
where
he
has
to
make
a
choice
whether
to
assert
one
of
two
constitutional
rights.
and
although
there
is
in
many
contexts
reluctance
to
put
an
individual
to
that
choice,
there
is
not
an
inflexible
rule
against
it.
and
to
take
one
example,
a
criminal
defendant
has
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
testify
in
his
own
defense.
he
also
has
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
resist
compelled
testimony
in
which
the
prosecution
will
ask
him
hostile
questions,
but
he
doesn't
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do
both.
if
he
chooses
--
chooses
to
take
the
stand
and
testify,
he
may
be
cross-examined
at
trial
by
the
prosecution,
and
he
has
no
residual
fifth
amendment
right
to
resist
the
hostile--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
don't
know
that
it's
more
fundamental
than
the
right
not
to
be
questioned
against
one's
will
in
a
criminal
proceeding--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
there
are
two
potential
objections
to
the
use
of
a
non-article
iii
judge,
and
one
of
them
would
be,
as
you
say,
structural,
that
is,
one
of
the
objections
that
is
sometimes
made
to
the
use
of
non-article
iii
adjudicators
is
that
if
congress
can
parcel
out
part
of
the
work
of
the
judiciary
to
other
units,
the
stature
of
the
judicial
branch
will
be
diminished.
i
think
this
particular
statute
doesn't
create
that
risk,
because
the
use
of
bankruptcy
judges
is
entirely
under
the
control
of
the
district
judges.
that
is,
the
district
court
decides
whether
to
refer
a
bankruptcy
case
to
the
bankruptcy
judge,
the
district
court
can
withdraw
the
referral
with
respect
to
particular
proceedings.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
concern
is
with
fairness
to
individual
litigants,
that
is,
the
idea
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
a
right
to
an
article
iii
tribunal
and
should
not
likely
be
held
to
have
waived
it,
i
think
that
a
person
who
seeks
affirmative
relief
from
a
court
doesn't
waive
all
his
constitutional
rights,
to
be
sure,
but
should
ordinarily
be
taken
to
accept
the
consequences
that
ordinarily
follow
from
a
request
for
judicial
relief.
and
as
a
matter
of
history
and
tradition,
one
of
the
consequences
that
follows
from
the
assertion
of
an
affirmative
claim
is
subjection
to
counterclaims,
and
especially
compulsory
counterclaims.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
court
has
applied
this
basic
principle
in
a
number
of
contexts.
that
is,
in
mcelrath
v.
united
states,
which
is
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
plaintiff
filed
suit
against
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
claims
and
the
united
states
then
asserted
counterclaims
against
him,
and
the
original
plaintiff
said
that
he
had
a
--
a
right
to
jury
trial
under
the
seventh
amendment.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
government
doesn't
have--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
government
can
make
conditions,
but
--
but
the
point
was
the
plaintiff
in
that
situation
had
no
alternative
forum
to
which
he
could
attempt
to
obtain
a
recovery
from
the
government.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
another
example
would
be
adam
v.
saenger,
which
is
also
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
in
which
i
believe
it
was
a
texas
plaintiff
filed
suit
in
the
california
state
courts,
and
the
california
defendant
asserted
a
--
a
cross-complaint,
basically
a
counterclaim,
against
him,
and
the
texas
plaintiff
objected
to
the
california
court's
assertion
of
personal
jurisdiction.
and
this
court
said:
by
seeking
affirmative
relief
from
the
california
court,
you
have
subjected
yourself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
for
all
purposes
which
justice
requires.
and
it
said
the
state
can
make
that
the
price
it
pays
for
seeking
affirmative
judicial
relief
in
its
courts.
now,
it
may
have--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--look--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--let
me
step
back
a
second
and
address
the
questions
that
were
posed
by
justices
sotomayor
and
alito
at
the
--
at
the
beginning
about
the
initial
authority
of
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
adjudicate
the
claim
brought
against
the
estate,
because
i
agree
with
my
colleague's
answer
that
this
is
a
question,
and
with
justice
sotomayor,
that
this
is
a
question
that
this
court
hasn't
squarely
resolved.
now,
it's
true
that
the
initial,
the
state
law
claim,
the
defamation
claim
that
was
made
the
basis
for
the
claim
against
the
estate,
was
a
state
law
cause
of
action.
but
as
this
court
said
in
katchen
v.
landy,
the
effect
of
the
commencement
of
the
bankruptcy
case
is
to
convert
the
claimant's
potential
legal
claim
against
the
defendant
into
an
equitable
claim
against
the
estate.
and
respondent's
equitable
claim
against
the
estate
seeking
a
share
of
the
assets
was
a
claim
created
by
federal
law.
that
is,
it's
true
that
in
the
course
of
deciding
whether
respondent
was
ultimately
entitled
to
a
share
of
the
estate,
the
bankruptcy
court
would
have
been
required
to
adjudicate
state
law
questions
and
conduct
something
like
the
same
proceedings
that
could
have
arisen
in
a
state
case,
but
actually
obtaining
a
share
of
the
bankruptcy
estate
requires
more
than
that
there
be
a
valid
debt.
the
whole
point
of
bankruptcy
is
to
deal
with
situations
in
which
the
debtor
doesn't
have
enough
assets
to
go
around,
and
so
the
bankruptcy
court
will
have
to
not
only
determine
whether
a
valid
debt
exists,
but
what
are
the
relative
priorities
of
various
creditors,
what
is
the
appropriate
pro
rata
share
for
a
particular
claimant,
and
all
of
that
is
to
be
resolved
under
federal
law.
so,
when
respondent
filed
a
proof
of
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
case,
it
was
asserting
a
federal
right
cognizable
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
and
again,
none
of
the
--
none
of
the
analogues
that
i
have
identified
are
precisely
analogous
to
this
one,
but
i
think
it's
noteworthy
that
respondent
cites
no
contrary
authority
from
this
court.
that
is,
respondent
cites
no
case
in
which
a
claimant
has
invoked
the
authority
of
a
particular
court
and
has
asked
for
affirmative
relief,
and
this
court
has
held
that
it
nevertheless
had
a
constitutional
entitlement
to
be
free
of
counterclaims.
and
that
seems
particularly
true
of
compulsory
counterclaims,
both
because
they
are
counterclaims
that
our
legal
system
affirmatively
encourages
to
be
brought
within
the
same
proceeding
and
for
the
reason
that
justice
ginsburg
said,
that
in
an
analogous
area
of
the
law
when
we
ask
whether
there
is
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
a
counterclaim
to
begin
with,
if
the
counterclaim
is
compulsory,
there
need
be
no
independent
basis
for
jurisdiction.
i
would
like
to
address
quickly
the
statutory
question,
and
the
relevant
provisions
begin
at
page
1a
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
157(b)(5)
is
in
our
view
not
jurisdictional.
it
deals
with
the
--
the
respective
authorities
of
the
bankruptcy
judge
and
the
district
court
within
the
bankruptcy
case,
but
it
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
what
the
--
the
federal
courts
can
adjudicate
and
the
limitations
on
bankruptcy
court
authority
are
waiveable
and
subject
to
consent.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
the
personal
injury
aspect
of
the
case.
there
is
a
--
a
lively
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
that
objection
to
bankruptcy
court
adjudication
was
properly
preserved,
and
that
would
be
open
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
if
this
court
were
to
reverse.
on
page
1a--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
--
yes,
i
mean,
this
could
have
been
a
prudential
factor
that
might
have
persuaded
the
court
not
to
grant
certiorari
in
the
first
instance,
but
the
court
has
obviously
identified
this
as
an
issue
that
warrants
the
expenditure
of
its
resources;
and
we
think
that
the
--
there
is
no
jurisdictional
impediment
to
a
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
again,
we
don't
have
a
position
with
respect
to
the
defamation
claim.
that
is,
defamation
claims
may
be
personal
injury
claims
in
many
contexts,
but
in
this
statute
it's
linked
with
wrongful
death,
which
seems
to
--
to
cut
the
other
way.
the
actual
counterclaim
was
not
a
defamation
claim;
it
was
a
tortious
interference
claim;
and
we
don't
think
that
would
be
a
personal
injury
claim.
with
respect
to
(b)(1),
it
says
bankruptcy
--
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
