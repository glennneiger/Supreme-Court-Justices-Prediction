are
there
any
limits,
mr.
richland?
suppose
that
congress
had
authorized
bankruptcy
courts
to
decide
contract
disputes
between
two
creditors
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
stewart,
do
--
do
you
think
that
we
should
resolve
the
constitutional
question
if
there's
some
significant
possibility
that
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
because
the
claims
would
be
found
to
fit
into
(b)(5)?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
englert,
one
real
difference
between
marathon
and
this
case
is
that
congress
passed
legislation
in
between
which
brought
the
bankruptcy
judges
under
the
control
of
the
district
courts
and
made
them
entirely
article
iii
entities.
so
you
can
look
at
a
case
like
marathon,
i
mean
not
--
supervised
by
article
iii
entities,
not
by
the
president,
not
by
congress.
so
one
can
look
at
a
case
like
marathon
and
say
the
problem
there
was
that
the
president
appointed
the
bankruptcy
judges
in
a
way
that
the
president
no
longer
does
and
that
the
district
courts
did
not
have
the
supervisory
control
over
the
bankruptcy
judges
in
the
way
that
they
do
now,
and
that
that
makes
a
constitutional
difference.
