justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
go
back
to
that
for
one
second?
i
understand
the
due
process
issue,
which
is
brandeis's
issue
in
crowell.
i
think
i
can
--
you're
not
going
to
say
anything
that
i
can't
read
in
the
brief
on
that.
but
the
other
one
is
worrying
me,
the
structural
issue.
so
imagine
there's
no
due
process
concern
whatsoever.
now,
when
i
looked
at
crowell,
your
case
would
seem
to
fall
right
in
it.
it
is
an
adjudication
under
the
law
as
such,
you
know,
between
two
people
--
whatever
that
famous
line
is.
you're
captured
by
that
one.
so
the
question
is:
can
you
get
out
of
it
with
later
cases?
and
you
point
to
schor
to
get
out
of
it.
and
schor,
as
i
read
it,
is
an
all-factors
case,
that
when
she
talks
in
the
structural
part
of
--
about
--
when
justice
o'connor
is
talking
about
the
non-due
process
part,
the
structural
part,
just
what
you
said,
that
there
isn't
a
hard-and-fast
rule,
that
there
are
a
bunch
of
factors
that
we
should
look
at.
at
least
that's
how
i
read
it.
and
you
were
reading
it
as
a
hard-and-fast
rule,
which
means
you
win.
now
--
now,
who's
--
should
i
just
read
this
case
further
and
make
up
my
mind
about
that,
or
is
there
something
you
want
to
say
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
what
she
says.
and
the
--
and
what
you're
interested
in
there,
the
key
thing
is
not
fairness.
the
key
thing
is
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
system.
in
crowell,
justice
hughes
says
you've
made
that
integrity
as
long
as
there
were
review
of
matters
of
fact,
the
independent
decision
by
a
court
of
questions
of
law,
and
reservation
to
the
court
of
constitutional
facts
which
have
never
been
heard
of
since.
okay?
so
we
have
this
case.
and
your
issue
is,
after
all,
something
that
for
many,
many
decades
or
longer
has
been
the
subject
of
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
the
bankruptcy
judge
is
an
adjunct
to
the
court.
it
is
well-established,
this
kind
of
review.
every
part
of
crowell
is
met.
so
what
is
--
what
is
essential
to
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process
that
requires
you
to
have
a
de
novo
hearing
before
a
district
court
rather
than
the
kind
of
review
that's
given
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
which
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
marathon,
you
know,
you
had
four,
four
and
--
and
who
knows
what
it
stands
for.
and
then
we
have
a
sentence
of
what
it
stands
for,
and
if
you
read
that
one
sentence,
i
don't
think
you
can
say
it's
a
slam-dunk
for
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
the
--
of
marathon
and
saying,
with
four
and
four
judges,
to
really
reject
a
decision
like
crowell,
which
is
a
kind
of
foundation
stone?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
true,
but
it's
also
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
--
if
we
were
to
decide
this
case,
and
suppose
we
decide
every
other
question
and
suppose
you
lost,
then
wouldn't
we
send
it
back
for
you
--
if
you're
right
on
that,
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
decide
about
that
as
an
independent
basis
for
no
jurisdiction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
had
to
make
that
premise
in
order
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
it's
that
hard
why
don't
we
just
dig
the
case?
i
guess--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
his
basic
argument
i
think
is
that
in
marathon--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--make
it
totally
fair.
nobody
is
being
treated
unfairly.
structurally
it
does
injure
the
--
the
prestige
or
something
or
the
structure
or
the
integrity
of
the
federal
government
--
judiciary,
federal
judiciary
--
to
allow
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
adjudicate
a
direct
claim;
why
is
a
counterclaim
different?
