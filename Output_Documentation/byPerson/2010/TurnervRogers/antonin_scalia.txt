justice
antonin
scalia
it's
--
it's
a
formal
adversary
proceeding
in
a
very
limited
sense
and
not
in
the
sense
that
caused
us
to
require
counsel
to
be
provided
in
criminal
proceedings
where
the
other
side
is
armed
with
the
legal
knowledge
that
the
poor
defendant
does
not
have.
many
of
these
proceedings
do
not
involve
counsel
on
the
other
side,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
counsel.
is
it
not
true
that
many,
perhaps
most
of
these
proceedings,
do
not
have
counsel
on
the
other
side?
it
is
the
wife
who
is
trying
to
get
--
a
payment
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
defaulted
alimony
and
does
not
have
counsel--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
don't
you
argue
for
a
rule
that
--
that
the
state
must
provide
counsel
for
the
defendant
in
these
cases
where
it
has
provided
counsel
or
there
is
paid
counsel
on
the
other
side?
wouldn't
that
be
fair?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waxman,
for
those
of
us
who
think
the
due
process
clause
doesn't
contain
whatever
we
think
it
ought
to
contain,
but
contains
what
the
people
who
ratified
it
thought
it
contained,
what's
the
earliest
case
that
you
have
which
adopts
the
proposition
that
you're
now
espousing,
that
whenever
a
civil
contempt
citation
is
imposed
upon
an
indigent
person,
that
person
is
entitled
to
counsel
as
a
matter
of
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
whenever
there
is
an
erroneous
judgment
in
a
civil
contempt
case,
it
becomes
a
criminal
contempt
case;
is
that
--
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
goodness,
if
--
if
you're
relying
for
that
proposition
only
on
the
fact
that
we've
already
said
it,
why
don't
you
also
say
we've
never
said
what
you
want
us
to
say
now?
i
mean,
if
that's
the
only
argument,
we've
already
said
it.
if
it
was
wrong,
we
should
unsay
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
all
of
the
arguments
you're
making
to
us
are
correct,
why
shouldn't
the
other
accompaniments
of
a
full
dress
criminal
trial
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
has
counsel,
but
the
burden's
been
put
on
him
rather
than
on
the
state
to
prove,
in
fact,
that
he
--
whether
or
not
he
is
indigent?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
illogical
distinction
is
what
i'm
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
justice
alito
can--
mr.
waxman
--
i'm
not
sure,
but--
--can
ask
his
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
isn't
the
requirement
that
the
judge
satisfy
himself
that
there's
a
willful
failure
to
comply
with
the
order?
why
doesn't
that
amount
to
saying
the
judge
has
to
satisfy
himself
that
this
individual
cannot
pay,
or
can
pay?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
willful
if
he
can
pay.
if
he
--
if
he
can't
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
what
i
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
petitioner
know
about
rule
23?
where
had
he
learned
about
that?
he
didn't
have
counsel,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
before
--
before
it
got
up
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
bibas,
i
have
a
question
about
--
about
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case.
the
government
agrees
with
you
that
we
don't
need
counsel,
but
says
that
we
ought
to
reverse
the
judgment
anyway,
because
there
were
--
because
the
other
aspects
of
due
process
which
the
government
asserts
would
make
it
unnecessary
to
provide
counsel,
did
not
exist
in
this
case.
did
you
think
under
our
ordinary
rules
we
--
we
can
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
question
presented
was
just
whether
counsel
was
necessary,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
suppose
it's
fully
within
the
power
of
the
government
to
say
why,
you
know,
in
general
counsel
is
not
necessary
because
these
other
procedures
are
good
enough.
but
then
to
come
forward
and
say
moreover,
those
procedures
were
not
applied
in
this
case
and
therefore
you
should
reverse,
that's
--
that's
a
new
point,
it
seems
to
me,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
that
the
rule
would
be
that
if
--
if
south
carolina
has
not
complied
with
minimum
due
process
procedures,
minimum
due
process
procedures
are
required,
not
counsel
is
required.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
all
of
this
discussion.
the
question
presented
is
not
what
due
process
procedures
are
required
in
these
cases.
that
is
not
the
question
presented.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
simply
whether
counsel
is
necessary.
isn't
that
the
only
matter
that
we
should
be
discussing?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
is
not
a
party
here,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
an
amicus.
so
this
expansion
of
the
--
of
the
question
presented
from
whether
counsel
was
necessary
to
what
are
the
due
process
procedures
required
is
all
at
the
suggestion
of
an
amicus;
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
a
question
about
your
mootness
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it's
not
capable
of
repetition,
and
yet
evading
review,
because
should
this
happen
again,
he
could
get
a
stay,
as
he
could
have
gotten
in
this
case.
do
you
have
any
case
of
ours
which
--
which
uses
that
reasoning
and
says
the
fact
that
in
a
future
case
you
may
be
able
to
get
a
stay
suffices
to
establish
that
this
is
not
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review?
it's
--
it's
a
new
argument
to
me.
is
there
any
case
of
ours
that
applies
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
i
don't
understand
how
we
could
say
that
if
you
do
not
meet
minimum
due
process
procedures,
you
must
meet
more
than
minimum
due
process
procedures.
i
mean,
once
we
say
that
it's
enough
if
you
do
a,
b,
and
c,
but
this
state
has
not
done
a,
b,
and
c,
how
can
we
say
therefore
you
must
appoint
counsel?
all
we
can
say
is
you
must
do
a,
b,
and
c.
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
where
we
impose
more
than
the
due
process
minimum
because
you
have
failed
to
comply
with
the
minimum.
