justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
in
your
opening
statement
you
said
whenever,
in
civil
contempt,
a
person
is
subject
to
incarceration
he
or
she
is
entitled
to
counsel.
in
your
opening
statement
you
didn't
limit
it
to
cases
like
the
case
we
have
before
us;
that
is,
where
the
defense
is
i'm
unable
to
pay.
therefore,
i
can't
get
out
of
jail.
are
you
limiting
--
are
you
limiting
your
argument
to
the
case
of
a
noncustodial
parent
or
a
former
husband
who
says
i
just
haven't
got
the
wherewithal
to
pay?
or
are
you
making
a
broader
claim
that
anytime
someone
is
subject
to
incarceration
they
must
have
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
all
the
trappings
of
criminal
procedure
come
with
it?
this
case
is
focused
on
a
right
to
counsel,
but
what
about
a
burden
of
proof,
what
about
a
jury
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
you
mentioned
lassiter,
and
you
mentioned
something
that
lassiter
said
in
passing,
but
what
was
at
stake
there
was
deprivation
of
parental
status.
and
the
court
said
sometimes,
in
some
cases,
yes,
but
we're
not
going
to
make
an
across-the-board
rule.
now,
that
deprivation,
some
people
think,
is
the
worst
possible,
for
a
custodial
parent
to
be
told
you're
no
longer
a
parent,
you
no
longer
have
a
child.
and
yet
the
court
said
we're
not
going
to
provide
counsel
in
every
case,
because
in
some
cases
the
person
can
get
a
fair
hearing
without
counsel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
go
for
alimony
and
palimony
as
well
as
child
support?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
it
did.
it
would
cover.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
state
--
we've
been
told
that
in
many
states
appointment
of
counsel
for
an
indigent,
noncustodial
parent
who
has
--
who
has
child
custody
--
that
counsel
is
automatic.
you
have
described
something
less
than
counsel.
is
there
any
model,
any
state
where
there
is
such
a
procedure
so
one
might
find
out
how
it's
working?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about,
an
aid
who
is
not
counsel?
and
the
family
court
has
a
lot
of
auxiliary
people
like
child
advocates
who
are
there
to
assist
people
who
need
some
kind
of
representation,
but
not
necessarily
a
lawyer.
is
that
any
part
of
your
--
of
what
you
would
propose?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
form
you
have
in
mind
something
different
than
the
form,
the
ifp
form
that
would
be
filled
out
say,
by
a
2255
petitioner?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
as
i
understand,
heard
this
case
after
he
was
released,
so
they
didn't
consider
it
moot.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
a
fact,
was
it
not,
that
he
was
already
released?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
true
that
most
states
in
child
support
cases,
when
the
defendant
says
i
have
no
money,
will
appoint
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
point
was
it's
only
if
the
defendant
--
the
complaint
is
only
if
the
defendant
does
not
have
keys
in
his
pocket
because
he
has
no
money.
so
in
cases
where
typical
recalcitrant
spouse
won't
pay
until
he's
threatened
with
jail,
that
wouldn't
come
in
this
category.
i
thought
mr.
waxman
was
speaking
about
people
who
do
not
have
the
keys
in
their
pockets
because
they
simply
cannot
--
they
do
not
have
the
wherewithal
to
pay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
you
--
you
stressed
that
this
falls
on
the
civil
side,
so
why
shouldn't
we
take
rule
54(d)
as
our
model
say
that
instructs
the
court
that
you
give
parties
the
relief
to
which
they
are
entitled,
even
if
they
haven't
asked
for
that
relief,
even
if
they've
asked
for
something
that
they
can't
get?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
any
--
any
computation
about
what
it
would
be,
what
the
counsel
fee
would
be
as
opposed
to
keeping
someone
in
prison
for
a
year?
