chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-10,
turner
v.
rogers.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
asked--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--counsel
!
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
stressed
that
the
burden
in
this
case
is
on
the
defendant.
would
your
position
be
different
if
the
burden
were
on
the
complainant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
just
to
be
clear,
your
answer
to
the
question
presented
is
no,
right?
it
was
not
error
for
the
south
carolina
court
to
say
there's
no
constitutional
right
in
this
type
of
a
proceeding
to
appointed
counsel?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
kruger.
mr.
bibas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
suppose--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
suppose
--
we
have
held,
haven't
we,
that
states
can
have
different
concepts
of
mootness
than
the
federal
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
know
why
we're
not
hearing
from
the
state
of
south
carolina?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i
understand
that
they
were
involved
below.
they
decided
not
to
become
a
party
before
the
state
supreme
court;
is
that
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
aren't
they
defending
their
procedures?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
may
be
an
unfair
question,
since
you
don't
represent
the
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
financial
interest
if
they
have
to
provide
counsel
in
these
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
can't
possibly
be
true,
because
we
have
cases
applying
the
rule
that
this
is
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review.
if
the
rule
were
you
have
to
get
a
stay,
we
wouldn't
have
any
of
those
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
waxman,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
