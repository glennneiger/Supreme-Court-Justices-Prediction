justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
we
agree
with
you,
isn't
this
going
to
create
an
imbalance?
now
in
this
case
ms.
rogers
was
not
represented
by
counsel
at
this
proceeding,
was
she?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
the
state
employee
sends
out
the
--
the
will
to
show
cause
and
proof
that,
evidence
that
the
--
the
noncustodial
parent
is
in
arrears
on
the
child
payments.
so
let's
see
what
would
happen
if
counsel
is
then
appointed
in
one
of
these
cases,
where
both
the
custodial
parent
and
the
noncustodial
parent
are
indigent
and
perhaps
not
very
well
educated.
counsel
is
appointed
for
the
noncustodial
parent,
and
counsel
comes
in
and
says
this
is
the
income
of
my
client,
and
he's
hurt,
he
was
hurt
on
the
job,
all
his
--
his
income
is
social
security
disability
benefits,
and
he
doesn't
have
enough
money
to
pay
child
support.
now,
the
custodial
--
the
non
--
the
custodial
parent
who
has
no
attorney
says
he's
not
really
hurt,
i
see
him,
i
see
him
walking
around,
he's
going
hunting,
he's
shooting
baskets,
he's
driving
around
in
a
new
car.
it
may
not
be
the
--
the
title
may
not
be
in
his
name,
he's
--
he's
out
on
the
street
corner,
he's
buying
drugs,
he's
drinking
alcohol,
but
i
don't
have
a
lawyer
and
i
can't
prove
any
of
this.
so
you've
created
a
great
imbalance
there,
haven't
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
isn't
something
like
what
the
solicitor
general
suggested
adequate
here?
the
state
provides
a
very
clear
form
for
the
noncustodial
parent
to
fill
out,
and
then
in
court
the
judge
goes
through
it
step
by
step,
are
you
working?
how
much
are
you
making?
do
you
have
any
other
money?
what
expenses
do
you
need
for
living?
and
then
if
you
run
into
some
of
these
complicated
legal
problems
or
arguably
complicated
legal
problems
that
you
referred
to,
maybe
in
particular
cases
there
would
be
need
for
the
appointment
of
counsel.
but
why
isn't
that
adequate
to
deal
with
this
situation
rather
than
a
categorical
rule
that
you
have
to
have
counsel
appointed
in
every
case
where
there's
an
issue
about
ability
to
pay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
think
the
issue
here
is
more
complicated
than
the
issue
about
whether
somebody's
probation
should
be
revoked?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
are
things
the
judge
could
have
asked,
though,
and
put
on
the
record,
and
it
might
have
cleared
this
up.
he
could
have
--
the
petitioner
here
said
he
wasn't
working
and
he
couldn't
work
because
he
had
been
hurt,
so
the
judge
could
have
asked
for
medical
records
to
substantiate
that.
and
then
the
petitioner
admitted
that
until
recently,
apparently,
he
had
been
taking
meth.
he
had
been
snorting
coke.
the
judge
could
have
said,
all
right,
you
had
the
money
then
to
buy
those
drugs;
now,
where
did
you
get
that
and
why
do
you
no
longer
have
that
source
of
money?
he
could
have
gone
through
a
few
simple
steps,
couldn't
he,
to
make
this
--
to
eliminate
the
problems?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
don't
have
the
social
security
disability
form,
but
if
the
judge
credited
that
and
accepted
that
your
client
is
--
was
unable
to
work
and
had
only
the
assets
listed
on
that
form,
would
he
not
then
automatically
be
--
have
shown
that
he
had
an
inability
to
pay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
thank
you.
