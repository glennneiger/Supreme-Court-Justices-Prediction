justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
waxman,
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
the
failure
in
this
case
or
the
failure
to
appoint
counsel
arises
from
a
due
process
complaint
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner
here
didn't
know
that
he
had
indigency
as
a
defense,
or
what
he
needed
to
prove
or
to
bring
to
court
to
prove
that.
why
wouldn't
the
solicitor
general's
solution
of
saying
as
long
as
a
state
tells
a
defendant
that
they
have
a
burden
of
proof
and
some
contours
of
what
proof
they
need
to
supply
or
--
on
that
issue,
that
that
would
satisfy
due
process?
what
can
a
lawyer
do
when
someone
comes
in
and
says,
i'm
not
earning
any
money,
i
can't
earn
it,
blah,
blah,
blah,
end
of
story?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
you
need?
why
do
you
need--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--he
admitted
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
at
least
up
until
the
accident.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
you
don't
think
an
individual
is
capable
of
saying,
i
can't
--
i'm
--
yes,
i
am
or
no
i'm
not
using
up
my
money
on
drugs;
that's
my
preference?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
i
have
a
$1,500
car,
but
i
need
it
to
be
able
to
do
something
else?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
is
that
form
in
the
record?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
is
the
form
in
the
record?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
hearing
you.
could
you
speak
more
loudly?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
as
i
--
and
then
i
think
one
of
the
deficiencies
in
addressing
your
argument
is
that
i
don't
really
know
what
the
state's
procedures
are.
your
--
your
co-counsel,
mr.
waxman,
has
said
there
was
actually
a
form.
i
don't
know
what
that
form
looks
like.
the
only
thing
that
does
seem
missing
that
the
state
clearly
provides
is
a
requirement
that
the
judge
explain
what
the
basis
of
his
contempt
finding
is.
i'm
looking
at
60a
and
61a,
and
this
judge
left
it
completely
blank.
so
is
this
a
due
process
violation
facially,
or
is
this
a
due
process
violation
as
applied,
meaning
it's
just
not
clear
to
me
whether
south
--
the
state's
process,
in
fact,
has
all
of
the
elements
that
you're
speaking
about
or
how
i
make
that
judgment
and
whether
the
--
we
didn't
grant
cert
on
the
question
of
whether,
as
applied,
there
was
a
failure
or
not.
i
mean,
one
of
the
difficulties
in
this
case
is
that
there
was
really
very
--
no
findings
by
the
judge
whatsoever.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
the
--
the
form,
the
order
for
contempt
of
court
itself,
61a,
does
require
the
judge
to
fill
out
an
answer
as
to
whether
he
thinks
the
defendant
is
gainfully
employed
or
has
the
ability
to
make
the
payments.
so
it
was
just
absent
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
do
we
have
jurisdiction
over
any
matter
that
isn't
rendered
in
a
final
judgment
in
state
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
over
anything
but
a
final
judgment,
how
could
we
ever
grant
a
stay
if
the
state
refused
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
a
state
refused
to
grant
a
stay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
why
would
south
--
why
would
the
state
here
have
granted
a
stay,
if
it
believes
there's
no
sixth
amendment
right
whatsoever
to
counsel?
how
could
that
litigant
ever
evade
mootness?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
point
to
any
case
involving
support
payments
in
which
the
south
carolina
court
has
ever
granted
a
stay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
--
i
took
the
solicitor
general's
position
to
be,
they
may
accuse
me
of
not
being
accurate
in
what
i
took
their
position
to
be,
which
is
the
rule
would
be
simple.
you,
a
state,
are
free
to
run
these
procedures
as
you
choose,
but
not
to
provide
counsel,
you
have
to
meet
some
minimum
mathews
v.
eldridge
requirements,
and
so
the
rule
is
simple.
the
state
can
do
what
it
wants,
but
it
has
to
provide
minimum
due
process,
and
they've
previously
set
forth
the
three,
all
right?
so
really
the
answer
is,
no,
you're
not
automatically
entitled
to
a
lawyer
if
you're
providing
minimum
due
process.
if
you're
not,
then
you
have
to
provide
a
lawyer.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
what's
wrong
with
that
rule?
that,
i
think,
is
what
the
solicitor
general
is
suggesting.
so
first,
what's
wrong
with
the
rule?
and,
then,
second,
in
a
case
in
which
i
did
not
see
and
haven't
yet
a
form
that
really
talks
about
or
tells
the
contemptor
about
his
defense
and
what
he
needs
to
prove,
yes,
he
did
get
a
hearing
but
not
a
hearing
that
explored
his
statement
that
he'd
been
looking
for
work
and
couldn't
find
it,
and
a
form,
a
judgment
that
doesn't
address
his
current
ability
to
pay.
how
does
the
south
carolina
system
comply
with
those
minimums
of
due
process?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
that
that
answers
my
question,
because
the
way
i
phrased
the
question
was
very
specific.
south
carolina,
there's
no
constitutional
right
to
counsel
in
every
proceeding,
but
the
question
presented
was
whether
south
carolina
erred
that
an
indigent
defendant
has
no
constitutional
right
to
appoint
counsel
in
any
civil
contempt
proceeding.
and
if
the
answer
to
that
is,
if
the
civil
contempt
proceeding
does
not
comply
with
minimum
due
process
requirements,
counsel
is
required.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
isn't
that
an
answer
to
the
question
presented?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
can
argue
about
that
later.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
the
point--
