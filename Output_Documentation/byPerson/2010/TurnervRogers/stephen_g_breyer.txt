justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
still
curious
--
are
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
go
back
to
the
--
what
happen.
i
think
what
the
government
says
should
happen,
you
should
give
them
a
form
and
the
form
should
say
do
you
have
money
to
pay
or
not.
so
what
did
happen,
did
the
judge
ever
ask
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
he
bring
some
proof
of
employment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
then
why
would
you
put
him
in
jail?
he
has
no
job.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
he
didn't
believe
him
about
what?
that
he
had
no
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
he
--
he
thought
he
did
have
the
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
actually
trying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--just
out
of
curiosity--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine,
but
i
would
like
to
ask
a
different
question.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
happened
here
that
was
different
from
what
the
government
suggests.
the
government
suggests
provide
a
piece
of
paper
and
ask
certain
questions.
what
i
would
like
to
know
is:
what's
different
in
this
proceeding
from
what
the
government
suggests?
that
would
have
--
perhaps
no
one
else,
but
could
have
an
effect
on
the
way
i
decide
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
there
was
no
--
look.
if
he
asked
the
questions
orally,
i
might
be
tempted
to
say
it
doesn't
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i'm
trying
to
say:
what
really
differed
from
what
the
government
wants?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
skip
that
one.
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
--
and
i'm
sorry,
i
may
be
the
only
one
trying
to
--
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is:
what,
in
general,
is
the
fairness
of
such
situations
in
where
the
woman
is
normally
the
one
with
the
child,
the
man
is
normally
the
one
who
doesn't
pay?
is
it
true,
for
example,
that
in
most
such
situations
across
the
country,
the
woman
has
a
lawyer
but
the
man
doesn't?
is
that
true
or
isn't
it
true?
there
must
be
some
organization
that's
studied
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
the
answer
to
what
i
think
of,
in
my
own
mind
only,
as
very
relevant,
whether
the
woman
has
a
lawyer
but
the
man
doesn't,
is:
i
don't
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
is
the
answer?
we
don't
have
good
information
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
fine.
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
are
things
that
--
did
anybody
look
at
housing
courts?
i
mean,
housing
courts,
i
would
think
it's
fairly
common.
someone
owes
somebody
$25,
or
whatever
it
is,
the
judge
says
pay
it
into
court,
and
what
happens
if
they
don't
pay
it
into
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
south
carolina's
family
court
sometimes
enforces
its
child
support
orders
by
holding
in
civil
contempt,
and
potentially
imprisoning
for
up
to
one
year,
those
whom
the
court
has
ordered
to
pay
child
support,
and
who
can
but
do
not
do
so.
applying
that
law,
the
south
carolina
court
sent
petitioner
michael
turner
to
prison
for
up
to
a
year,
or
until
he
paid
the
child
support
he
owed,
whichever
came
first.
turner,
who
says
he
is
indigent,
had
no
lawyer
at
a
civil
contempt
hearing.
and
he's
asked
us
to
decide
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause
requires
the
state
to
provide
with
counsel
at
a
civil
contempt
hearing
an
indigent
person
potentially
faced
with
imprisonment.
now,
this
is
a
civil
case,
and
traditionally,
a
person
imprisoned
for
civil
contempt,
for
violating
a
court
order
can
be
released
by
complying
with
the
order.
its
slogan
is,
he
"carries
the
keys
of
his
prison
in
his
own
pocket."
still,
an
indigent
may
find
it
difficult
to
comply
with
an
order
to
pay
child
support
and
for
that
reason,
might
have
a
defense
to
the
contempt
charge.
but
is
he
indigent,
so
that
he
cannot
pay?
turner
says
he
should
have
a
lawyer
to
help
him
answer
that
question.
in
reaching
our
conclusion,
we
balanced
several
relevant
interests.
turner
has
an
obviously
strong
interest
on
his
side,
namely
that
accuracy
in
respect
to
his
financial
status
is
especially
important,
because
he
is
threatened
with
prison.
but
three
other
factors,
which
we
explain
in
detail
in
our
opinion,
lead
us
to
conclude
that
nonetheless,
a
defendant
in
turner's
position
is
not
automatically
entitled
to
a
lawyer.
first,
although
the
issue
of
ability
to
pay
is
important,
it
will
often
be
fairly
easy
to
show.
even
in
a
criminal
case,
a
defendant
who
won't
yet
a
have
a
lawyer
has
to
provide
information
that
shows
that
he's
indigent
before
he
can
insist
that
the
state
give
him
a
lawyer.
second,
what
about
the
other
parent
who
has
owed
child
support?
sometimes,
the
person
who
stands
the
benefit
from
child
support
enforcement
is
not
the
state
but
the
other
parent.
and
that
parent,
say
the
mother,
maybe
relatively
poor,
unemployed,
and
be
unable
to
afford
counsel.
in
such
a
case
to
give
a
lawyer
to
only
one
side,
say
the
father,
but
not
to
the
mother,
could
make
the
proceeding
taken
as
a
whole,
less
fair,
not
more
fair.
third,
at
the
same
time,
we
believe
there
are
alternative
procedures
that
could
protect
the
defendant's
rights
with
less
risk
of
unnecessarily
depriving
the
family
of
the
child
support
payments
that
they
need.
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out,
those
alternatives
include,
notice
to
the
defendant
that
his
ability
to
pay
is
a
very
important
issue,
the
use
of
a
form
or
some
other
equivalent
to
elicit
relevant
financial
information,
an
opportunity
at
the
hearing
for
the
defendant
to
respond
to
follow
up
questions,
say
by
the
judge,
and
an
expressed
finding
by
the
court
whether
the
defendant
does,
or
does
not
have
the
ability
to
pay.
we
conclude
that
where
as
here
the
custodial
parent,
here,
is
the
child's
mother,
is
not
represented
by
a
counsel,
the
state
need
not
provide
counsel
to
turner
be
a
noncustodial
parent
who
is
supposed
to
pay
the
child
support.
but
we
attach
important
caveat,
namely
that
the
state
must
nonetheless
have
in
place
alternative
procedures
that
assure
a
fundamentally
fair
determination
of
the
critical
question,
whether
the
father
was
or
was
not
able
to
comply
with
the
support
order.
here,
south
carolina
provided
neither
counsel
nor
alternative
procedures.
thus,
turner's
proceedings
were
constitutionally
defective.
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
and
we
remand
the
case.
