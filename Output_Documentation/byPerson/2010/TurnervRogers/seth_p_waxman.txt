mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
due
process
requires
the
assistance
of
counsel
before
an
alleged
civil
contemnor
can
be
incarcerated.
that
categorical
rule
flows
from
the
imposition
by
a
court
in
a
formal
adversary
proceeding
of
what
this
court
has
termed,
quote,
"the
awesome
prospected
of
incarceration".
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
scalia,
the
answer
is
yes
and
no.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
call
this
nonadversarial
because
the
--
because
south
carolina
as
a
matter
of--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
it
is
--
the
contrary
is
true.
according
to
the
government
statistics,
70
percent
of
noncustodial
parents
either
have
no
income
or
have
income
less
than
$10,000,
and
therefore
in
a
state
--
in
every
state
that
accepts
tanf
funds,
which
is
every
state,
they
are
represented
by
the
state
agency,
and
south
carolina
in
this
case
has
made
a
rule
that
in-state
cases
--
and
that
also
includes
nonwelfare
cases
where
the
--
a
custodial
parent
has
chosen
to
be
represented
by
the
state
--
the
state
entirely
carries
its
prosecutorial
burden
by
filing
a
rule
to
show
cause
and
an
affidavit
showing
arrearages,
and
that
places
the
burden,
which
south
carolina
says
is
a
heavy
burden,
on
the
defendant
to
prove
inability
to
comply
as
a
condition
of
maintaining
his
liberty.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
ms.
rogers
--
in
most
of
the
proceedings,
and
it
--
it
does
vary
from
one
to
the
other.
in
all
--
let's
put
it
this
way,
all
of
the
proceedings
the
charges
and
the
state's
prima
facie
case
of
willful
contempt
was
established
by
a
state
employee.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
not
at
all,
justice
alito.
first
of
all,
in
all
--
in
the
--
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
department
of
social
services
is
in
fact
the
real
party
in
interest
and
the
moving
party,
and
in
any
private
case,
for
a
nominal
fee
the
custodial
mother
can
have
the
department
of
social
services
act
in
that
role
as
federal
law
requires
the
state
to
do.
second
of
all--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
would
certainly
be
more
than
fair,
and
the
number
of
instances
--
let
--
let's
be
clear
about
this.
the
number
of
instances
in
which
the
state
will
be
required
to
appoint
counsel
for
the
alleged
civil
contemnor
will
be
in
cases
where
--
i
mean,
there's
no
reason
why
the
state
of
south
carolina
when
it
issues
the
summons
and
the
affidavit
says
fill
out
this
form
and
let
us
know
whether
you
have
assets
or
have
income;
in
all
of
those
cases
where
they
believe
that
this
is
a
turnip,
not
a
deadbeat
dad,
they
will
proceed
with
remedies
other
--
other
than
incarceration.
it's
only
when
they
want
to
proceed
in
the
face
of
a
form
that
shows
indigence
and
inability
to
have
counsel,
that
the
state
has
to
provide
a
lawyer
before
it
--
before
it
puts
this
man
in
jail.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
is
definitely
the
broader
claim;
that
is,
this
--
this
decision
about
counsel
has
to
be
determined
ex
ante,
because
the
state
--
and
this
is
our
limit
--
i
suppose
our
more
limited
request
for
a
categorical
rule.
where
you
have
a
state
that
has
placed
the
burden
on
the
noncustodial
parent--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
no.
our
submission
is
any
case
in
which
the
state
proposes
to
deprive
somebody
with
an
unqualified
right
to
liberty
of
that
liberty
by
actual
incarceration,
there
is
a
right
to
counsel.
now
there
is
a
right
to
appointed--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
--
the
cases
have
recognized
the
distinction,
justice
kennedy,
between
direct
contempt
and
indirect
contempt;
and
direct
contempt,
which
is
a
witness
in
the
courtroom
refuses
to
testify,
the
cases
have
--
both
civil
and
criminal
--
have
not
required
the
appointment
of
counsel
or
a
jury
trial
or
anything
like
that.
in
--
in
a
case
where
the
grand
jury
witness
refuses
to
testify,
the
cases
all
to
my
knowledge
do
require
the
appointment
of
counsel,
because
there
may
be
a
defense,
and
someone
is
being
deprived
of
their
liberty.
now,
i
think
it's
important,
justice
ginsburg
you
asked
me
if
i
have
a
more
limited
rule,
and
in
this
instance
the
limited
rule
is
that
certainly
counsel
requires
--
certainly
the
due
process
clause
requires
the
appointment
of
counsel
where
the
state
places
the
affirmative
burden
on
the
contemnor
to
demonstrate
as
a
matter
of
law
and
fact
that
he
was
unable
to
comply,
and
thus
that
incarceration
would
not
be
unlawful
punishment,
but
lawful
coercion;
and
that
is,
i
think,
an
important
distinction.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
reason--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
reason
it
doesn't
satisfy
--
even
if
the
--
even
if
the
defendant
is
advised
that
there
is
an
inability-to-comply
defense.
and
that
a
sentence
imposed
where
there
is
an
inability
to
comply
is
unlawful
under
gompers
and
bagwell,
and
for
that
matter
under
south
carolina
law,
is
that
the
showing
that
the
--
the
burden
that
the
defendant
has
to
shoulder,
the
shoulder
--
the
showing
that
the
defendant
has
to
make
is
both
legal
and
factual
and
neither
one
of
them
is
straightforward.
it's
legal,
for
example,
because
there
are
lots
of
legal
questions
built
into
the
unable-to-comply
defense,
including
what
it
means
to
be
unable
to
comply.
intentional
underemployment,
the
allegation
made
in
this
court
that
he's
using
up
all
his
income
on
drug
use,
the
ability
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
no,
he
admitted
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
exactly.
but
the
point
is
that
using
--
intentional
underemployment,
the
drug
use,
the
ability
to
incarcerate
somebody
so
that
they
can
reduce
their
arrearage
on
a
work
release
program,
perhaps
the
requirement
that
he
sell
his
$1,500
car,
those
are
all
legal
questions
as
to
whether
the
defendant
--
they
constitute
an
inability
to
comply.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
mean,
the
--
the
first
of
all--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
sotomayor,
even
leaving
aside
all
of
those
undecided
questions
under
south
carolina
--
legal
questions
under
south
carolina
law,
even
as
to
the
facts
that
you've
addressed,
the
burden
is
not
insignificant.
recall
that
a
mere
assertion,
i
mean
in
this
case
this
man
filled
out
a
form
saying
that
--
certifying
that
he
had
no
income
and
one
asset,
a
car
worth
$1,500.
in
order
--
the
--
the
courts
have
said
that
assertions
don't
satisfy
it.
he
has
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--hmm?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
form
is
in
the
trial
record;
we
did
not
include
it
in
the
--
in
the
joint
appendix.
we
can
make
it
available
to
the
court.
it
--
it
is
in
the
trial
record,
and
we
didn't
understand
at
the
time
we
were
filing
that
the
united
states
would
be
making
an
argument
that
the
submission
of
a,
quote,
"simple
form"
would
satisfy
due
process.
i
--
i
thought
of
lodging
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--but
i
think
the
court's
lodging
rules--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
the
case
would
--
our
case
would
not
be
as
strong.
to
be
sure,
in
the
criminal
--
in
the
criminal
contempt
context,
the
burden,
of
course,
is
on
the
state,
and
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
there
is
an
acknowledged
right
to
counsel,
and
there
was
for
decades
before
this
court
considered
criminal
contempt
to
be
a
crime
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
so
i
think
we
would
still
--
even
if
the
burden
had
shifted,
the
broader
role
we're
asking
for
is,
look,
the
--
here
the
state
is
sending
a
man
to
jail
repeatedly
on
the
premise
of
exacting
compliance
with
court
orders,
and
on
the
theory
that
he
holds
the
keys
to
his
own
pocket
because
he
can
always
choose
to
comply.
and
our
submission
is
that
when
the
state
uses
that
sanction
on
the
basis
of
that
theory,
due
process
demands
that
it
guarantee
the
assistance
of
counsel
to
assure
that
the
district
court
is
right
and
that
the
sentence
imposed
is
lawfully
coercive
and
not
unconstitutionally
punitive.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
our--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--certainly
--
i
mean,
we
think
that
given
the
way
the
adversary
system
works
and
given
the
legal
nature
of
the
determination
that
a
judge
makes
depriving
somebody
of
liberty,
and
given
the
significant
burdens
that
are
faced
in
carrying
the
burden
to
establish
that,
there
are
none.
due
process
requires
the
application
of
what
this
court
in
lassiter
called
the
general
rule
or
the
presumption
that
civil
or
criminal,
when
the
state
chooses
to
absolutely
deprive
somebody
fully
at
liberty
of
his
liberty,
it
must
provide
counsel.
i
mean,
i
suppose
the
closest
second
would
be
what
justice
powell
providing
the
fifth
vote
in
vitek
provided,
which
is
even
in
that
case
where
the
decision
was
being
made
by
a
mental
health
professional
and
the
issue
involved
the
transfer
from
somebody
in
state
prison
to
a
state
mental
unit,
a
much
diminished
liberty
interest.
even
justice
powell,
providing
the
fifth
vote,
said,
well,
in
light
of
the
nature
of
the
decision
being
made
and
the
decision-making
body,
i
wouldn't
always
require
counsel.
i
would
think
that
a
trained
mental
health
professional--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
if
i
had
such
a
case,
it
would
have
appeared
quite
prominently
in
my
brief.
there
is
no
such
case,
but
let
me
make
two
points
about
history
and
what
the
due
process
clause
means,
notwithstanding
what
some
of
us
might
like
it
to
mean.
first
of
all,
history
--
the
history
is
very,
very
complicated,
and
it
doesn't
dictate
the
answer.
the
traditional
distinction
along
the
lines
was
not
between
civil
or
criminal
contempt,
but
direct
or
indirect
contempt,
and
as
i
know
your
honor
knows
because
you've
written
it,
traditionally
at
common
law,
i
mean,
counsel
was
provided
for
civil
cases,
and
in
misdemeanor
cases,
but
not
felony
cases.
the
criminal
civil
distinction
in
contempt
arose
in
this
court
around
the
turn
of
the
20th
century,
and
it
arose
so
that
the
courts
could
exercise
more
supervisory
review
over
the
imposition
of
criminal
contempt
by
courts.
now
in
cooke
and
oliver,
this
court,
as
i
said,
long,
long
before
it
recognized
that
criminal
contempt
was
a
sixth
--
a
crime
entitled
to
all
sixth
amendment
protections,
held
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
deprivation
of
liberty,
the
appointment
of
counsel
was
required.
and
our
submission
here
is
as
this
court
has
recognized,
the
distinction
between
civil
and
criminal
contempt
is
the
question
of
whether
you
have
coercive
imprisonment
or
imprisonment
as
punishment.
and
in
almost
every
case,
the
sentence
involves
some
aspect
of
both,
and
where
the
only
thing,
the
only
thing
that
keeps
the
coercive
imprisonment
from
being
unconstitutionally
punitive
absent
a
jury
trial
right
and
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
counsel,
is
the
ability
to
comply
with
the
court's
order.
and
that
burden
is
put
on
the
defendant,
even
though
it
is
the
state's
burden
to
prove
willfulness,
due
process
--
fundamental
fairness
as
due
process.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
this
--
this
court
has
said
in
bagwell
and
in
gompers
that
in
the
event
that
the
sentence
applied
--
in
bagwell
it
was
a
fine,
in
gompers
it
was
imprisonment
--
served
only
punitive
purposes
and
could
not
be
coercive
because
the
defendant
could
not
comply,
that
sentence
was
unlawful
because
it
had
not
been
imposed
following
a
proceeding
in
which
the
government--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--but,
yeah
--
just
in
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer,
just
to
finish
this
sentence
--
that
is
the
sine
qua
non
of
the
distinction,
and
unlike,
for
example,
the
immigration
context
and
the
other
contexts
that
the
government
is
relying
on,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
consequence
of
an
error,
that
is
an
erroneous
outcome
renders
the
detention
an
unlawful
criminal
penalty.
that
is
not
true
in
any
other
context.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
justice
ginsburg,
this
court
has
made
--
we're
talking
about
a
determination
ex
ante,
before
the
man
is
sent
to
jail,
in
this
case
for
repeated
long
periods,
should
he
be
appointed
counsel.
this
court
has
already
said
that
in
civil
contempt
proceedings
there
is
no
requirement
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
there
is
no
requirement
of
proof
of
a
jury
trial,
just
as
following
gault,
this
court
said
there
is
no
requirement
of
a
jury
trial
in
a
juvenile
commitment
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
wasn't
wrong,
justice
scalia,
and
as
we've
pointed
out,
the
majority
of
states
and
all
seven
circuits
that
have
spoken
to
this
question
have
all
held
that
there
is,
in
fact,
a
right
to
appointed
counsel
before
the
state
in
an
--
in
an
assertedly
civil
contempt
proceeding
can
deprive
a
human
being
of
his
liberty.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
because--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--because
the
proceeding
is
civil.
it
is
not
our
contention
that
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding,
and
this
court
in
maggio
and
in
hicks
v.
feiock
made
clear
that
shifting
the
burden,
so
long
as
the
--
so
long
as
the
imprisonment
is
meant
to
be
coercive,
shifting
the
burden
is
not
unconstitutional
and
because--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
sorry
--
and
because
it
is
a
civil
proceeding--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
justice
alito?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it's
--
that
submission
is
inconsistent
with
how
the
adversary
process
works,
and
more
importantly,
justice
alito,
it
misunderstands
the
nature
of
the
burden.
unlike
in
gagnon
v.
scarpelli,
where
the
mine-run
of
cases
only
involved
the
parole
revocation
board
to
determine
whether
somebody
had
subsequently
been
convicted,
here
the
mine-run
of
cases
involves
things
that
--
that
an
uncounseled,
lay,
often
undereducated,
often
incarcerated
defendant
can't
do.
for
example,
just
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
what
gagnon
v.
scarpelli
said
was
in
any
--
in
the
mine-run
of
cases,
all
that
is
required
with
respect
to
somebody
who
has
a
highly
reduced
liberty
interest
in
an
informal
proceeding
is
whether
or
not
they
have
subsequently
been
convicted,
yes
or
no.
and
if
it's
any
more
than
that
binary
factor,
counsel
probably
is
going
to
be
required.
and
our
submission
is
the
mine-run
of
these
cases
involve
the
marshaling
of
evidence
and
testimony
that
uncounseled,
uneducated
defendants
are
not
likely
to
be
able
to
do
on
legal
questions.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
right.
and
what
the
court
--
and
recognizing
that
lassiter
is
dicta,
because
it
did
consider
that
context,
what
it
said
is
we
have
to
--
we
have
to
do
the
matthews
v.
eldridge
balancing
against
a
generalization,
a
preeminent
generalization
that
exists
in
our
case
law,
which
is
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
an
indigent
defendant
has
a
right
to
appointed
counsel
only
when
he
loses
or
may
be
deprived
of
his
liberties.
since
that
doesn't
apply
here,
we
have
to
do
the
matthews
v.
eldridge
balancing
against
the
presumption
that
cuts
the
other
way.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
kennedy,
the
vast
majority
of
jurisdictions
require
counsel
and
provide
counsel,
and
there
is
no
--
we
would
think
if
this
were--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
believe
the
rule
is
that
if
you
have
a
right
to
counsel,
the
court
is
required
to
advise
you
that
if
you
--
that
you
have
one,
and
if
you
are
unable
to
afford--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
not
aware--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
not
aware
of
data
one
way
or
the
other.
we're
only
asking
this
court
to
conform
this
court's
process
jurisprudence
with
the
vast
majority
of
state
and
lower
federal
courts
that
have
found
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
would
go
to
any
instance
in
which
an
alleged
civil
contemnor
is
facing
incarceration.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
and
can
demonstrate
an
inability
to
afford
counsel
in
the
same
way
that
happens
in
misdemeanor
cases.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
have
three
points.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
i
mean
this
--
the
crux
of
this
dispute
comes
down
to
whether
this
is
some
--
akin
to
some
sort
of
simple
form
that
can
be
filled
out
that
any
layperson,
no
matter
how
uneducated,
can
deal
with.
second,
the
question
is
how
much
of
a
burden
is
this
going
to
be
on
the
states?
and,
third,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
what
counsel
suggests
as
the
utah
model
or
what
he
denigrates
as
the
new
jersey
model
would
be
a
way
to
square
this
circle.
first
of
all,
counsel
says
he
can't
conceive
of
a
legal
issue
that
can
arise
in
this
case.
let's
just
look
at
this
case
as
an
example.
there
was
allegations
of
an
admission
of
drug
use.
does
or
does
that
not
constitute
an
inability
to
pay?
that
is
a
legal
question.
it
is
not
a
factual
question.
inability
to
comply
is
a
legal
defense,
not
a
factual
excuse.
the
allegation
was
he's
not
employed,
but
maybe
he's
not
looking
for
work
or
he's
underemployed.
is
that
inability
to
comply
for
purposes
of
a
coercive
contempt
sanction?
our
suggestion
is
he
could
be
incarcerated
so
that
he
could
be
placed
on
work
release
in
a
county
jail
program
and
reduce
his
arrearage.
is
that
or
is
that
not
a
permissible
application
of
a
coercive
sanction
of
incarceration?
the
cases
that
we've
seen
have
said
no,
but
it
is
an
open
legal
question.
even
as
to
the
marshaling
of
evidence,
it
is
his
burden
not
to
just
say,
oh,
i
can't
pay.
he
submitted
a
form
that
he
filed
for
his
disability
payments
that
said
i
have
no
income
and
i
have
a
car
that's
worth
$1,500.
did
he
have
to
pay
that
car
--
sell
the
car
to
pay
or
not?
in
terms
of
burden,
the
state
is
paying
--
there
are
approximately
15
percent
of
the
state's
jail
population
in
any
given
year
that
are
noncustodial
parents
that
are
serving
terms,
in
this
case
two
6-month
terms
and
a
year
term,
at
the
cost,
according
to
the
statistics,
at
the
cost
of
between
13
and
17
thousand
dollars
a
year.
south
carolina,
because
it
refuses
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
federal
program,
has
already
paid
$72
million
to
the
government
in
fines
and
owes
another
10;
and
if
you
want
to
really
reduce
the
cost,
justice
kennedy,
and
make
this
manageable,
take
the
system
that
they
are
applauding
in
utah
or
denigrating
in
new
jersey.
when
the
court
sends
out
its
order
to
show
cause,
it
says
please
fill
out
this
form
showing
whether
you
have
income,
whether
you
have
assets,
and
whether
you
are
unable
to
hire
counsel.
if
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
but
we
don't
know
whether
the
judge
even
looked
at
the
form,
and
we
know
from
south
carolina
law
that
a
mere
assertion
is
not
the
marshaling
of
evidentiary
support
that's
required
to
carry
the
burden.
