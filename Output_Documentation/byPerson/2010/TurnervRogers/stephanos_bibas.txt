mr.
stephanos
bibas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mrs.
rogers
and
custodial
mothers
and
parents
like
her
need
simple,
fast,
civil
procedures
to
probe
fathers'
chronic
failures
to
support
their
children.
today
i'll
make
two
points.
first,
this
case
is
moot.
second,
a
per
se
right
to
appointed
counsel
is
not
essential
to
prevent
fundamental
unfairness.
on
remand
there
is
no
possible
redress
for
petitioner.
he
seeks
an
advisory
opinion
but
fails
to
bear
his
burden
of
proving
that
his
case
will
evade
review
because
he
could
get
a
stay.
litigants
must
preserve
questions
by
seeking
stays
or
--
supersedence
--
where
available.
only
where
there
is
no
procedure
of
which
petitioner
could
have
availed
himself
to
stay
confinement,
because
a
state
statute
had
a
blanket
denial
of
bail
pending
appeal,
did
this
court
in
sibron
find
that
a
dispute
could
not
be
stayed
and
so
would
evade
review.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
the
issue
was
not
briefed
or
argued
or
raised.
my
client
had
no
lawyer,
filed
no
brief,
made
no
argument,
so
we
don't
know
what
they
considered
or
held.
they
made
no
reference
to
it.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
your
honor,
that's
right.
and
south
carolina
deals
with
this
issue
--
obviously
in
this
court
the
question
is
an
article
iii
question.
and
because
the
evading
review
is
an
exception
to
article
iii's
normal
requirements
that
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
only
over
live
cases
or
controversies,
it
should
be
construed
narrowly,
only
where
essential
to
preserve
review.
here
petitioner
didn't
ask
for
a
stay;
if
he
had
asked--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
i
--
your--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--i--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--your
honor
is
correct
that
the
relief
would
be
coming
from
the
south
carolina
state
courts,
and
south
carolina
ruled
241(c)
appears
to
be
tailor-made
for
this
situation.
and
it
instructs
courts
to
consider
whether
a
stay
is
necessary
to
preserve
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal
or
to
prevent
the
contested
issue
from
becoming
moot.
our
position
is--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--the
closest
i
can
point
to
is
berry
v.
januario,
a
south
carolina
state
court
case
involving
parental
termination
--
termination
of
parental
rights
from
a
family
court,
where
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
stayed
the
matter;
and
so
if
petitioner
had
asked,
there's
a
substantial
likelihood
the
court
would
have
granted
a
stay
through
the
south
carolina
supreme
court;
at
this
point
under
rule
23
this
court
could
affirm--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--he
had
counsel
as
of
no
later
than
three
weeks
after
the
trial
court
hearing.
he
had
counsel
for
11
months
of
the
sentence.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
that's
right,
11
months
before
the
case
became
moot.
on
the
merits,
a
civil
contempt
case
does
not,
as
my
adversary
suggests,
quote,
"sound
in
criminal
contempt"
and
require
counsel,
quote,
"precisely
to
ensure
that
the
proceeding
remains
civil.
"
mr.
stephanos
bibas
no.
your
honor,
i
believe
the
main
argument
here,
and
the
only
one
the
petitioner
argued
in
the
courts
below,
is
an
absolute
categorical
right
that
any
loss
of
liberty
equals
an
absolute
right
to
counsel.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
that
is
his
fallback
argument,
though
it
wasn't
developed
in
the
courts
below,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
because
his
argument
approaches
and,
in
fact,
leads
with
an
absolute
claim
to
note
the
breadth
of
the
rule.
so
picking
up
on
your
question
to
mr.
waxman,
justice
kennedy,
it's
important
to
note
not
only
that
petitioner's
rule
would
reach
other
civil
contempt
beyond
child
support,
but
because
any
loss
of
liberty
is
the
overwhelming
factor
in
his
calculus,
it
would
apply
to
tens
of
thousands
of
immigration
and
extradition
cases.
petitioner's
reply
brief
does
not
deny
this,
saying
only
that
they
might
or
might
not
be
distinguishable.
and
immigration,
we
would
submit,
is
an
a
fortiori
from
this
case.
the
legal
issues
there
are
more
complex,
the
deprivation
is
more
severe,
the
confinement
not
purgeable.
any
ruling--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
justice
kennedy,
there
would
be
a
massive
change.
trial
judges
need
to
know
ahead
of
time
which
sets
of
procedures
to
apply,
civil
or
criminal.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
that
is
not
true
of
most
states,
justice
ginsburg.
my
understanding
is
fifteen
states
recognize
it
as
a
constitutional
matter,
eleven
additional
states
by
statute
rule
or
practice
appear
to
recognize
a
statewide
right
to
counsel,
so
there's
a
bear
majority.
at
least
17
states
do
not
have
a
statewide
right
and
the
remaining
seven
are
unclear.
so,
we're
talking
about
reformulating
rules
in
a
huge
number
of
states
that
probably
affect
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cases.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
office
of
child
support
enforcement
study
that's
in
the
appendix
to
the
senator's
brief,
it's
the
best
empirical
evidence
we
have
of
how
these
proceedings
work.
and
the
evidence
is
relevant
both
to
the
need
for
these
procedures
in
the
balancing
test
justice
kennedy
refers
to,
but
also
the
apparent
relatively
low
reason
to
believe
there's
a
large
error
rate
here.
according
to
that
study,
many
parents
--
non-supporting
parents
are
cited
for
contempt
and
purged
of
their
contempt,
many
fewer
are,
in
fact,
confined.
it
is
--
appears
to
be
the
threat
that
coerces
enforcement
and
deters
violation.
many
parents
do
not
pay
up
until
after
the
contempt
hearing
and
confinement
is
imminent.
so
states
would
have
to
appoint
counsel
in
a
large
number
of
cases,
most
of
which
wind
up
purging,
so
the
first
point
to
note
is
that--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor,
but
very,
very
many
non-supporting
parents
protest
the
same.
and
so,
it
is
true
that
the
slice
of
those
brought
to
civil
contempt
hearings
is
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
overall
caseload.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
exactly,
justice
kennedy.
trial
judges
need
to
be
able
to
protect
themselves.
they
need
to
be
able
to
know
when
they
go
into
a
hearing
whether
to
apply
civil
or
criminal
procedures,
and
that's
this
court's
lesson
in
hicks
versus
feiock.
hicks
said
a
judge
needs
to
know
ex
ante
based
on
a
couple
of
simple
rules.
quote,
if
the
relief
imposed
here
is,
in
fact,
a
determinant
sentence
with
a
purge
clause,
then
it
is
civil,
then
civil
procedures
apply.
and
if
the
remedy
runs
to
the
injured
party,
then
it
is
civil.
but
to
--
even
cases
that
have
overturned
erroneous
civil
contempt,
do
not,
as
my
brother
mr.
waxman
suggests,
become
punitive
and
criminal.
maggio
and
shillitani
recognize
that
they
remain
civil.
shillitani
declined
to
find
a
right
to
indictment
or
jury
trial
because
it
was
a
civil
case.
to
go
back
to
the--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
your
honor.
first
i'll
talk
about
the
solicitor
general's
suggestions
that
you
raise
and
then
talk
about
the
specific
procedures
here.
we
think
the
solicitor
general's
suggestions
are
interesting,
they're
worth
exploring,
they
were
raised
for
the
very
first
time
at
the
merits
stage
here,
so
there's
been
no
development.
we
don't
know
what
other
states
are
doing,
the
range
of
options
out
there,
the
nonconstitutional
measures
which
in
the
criminal
context
for
guilty
pleas
were
developed
through
rulemaking,
rule
11,
lots
of
testimony
and
inquiry.
that's
appropriate
for
development
when
presented
and
allowing
those
other
bodies
the
first
crack
at
them.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
no,
your
honor,
that's
beyond
the
question
presented.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
that's
correct.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
your
honor,
and
as
justice
sotomayor
pointed
out,
that's
not
what
this
court
granted
certiorari
on.
and
this
is
a
case--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
this
is
a
question
about
relief.
i
believe
this
is
a
question
about
what
constitutional
right
is
implicated.
this
case
arises
from
a
state
court.
the
failure
to
raise
the
issue
below
is
jurisdictional
and
is
not
--
that
issue
is
not--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--your
honor,
i
respectfully--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--i
don't
read
the
question
presented
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
okay.
fine.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
justice
scalia.
in
the
case
presenting
that
issue,
that's
the
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
here's
what
happened,
justice
breyer,
the
rule
to
show
cause
at
joint
appendix
50
a
said
in
all
capital
letters,
must
bring
proof
of
employment.
this
was
petitioner's
sixth
hearing,
he
was
familiar
with
the
issues
before.
at
petition
appendix
17
a--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--he
did
not.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
all
right.
he
had
--
he
explained
that
he,
in
fact
--
tried
to
explain
why
he
didn't
have
the
money,
that
he
had
been
--
both
his
drugs
and
two
months
of
disability.
the
judge,
on
the
next
page,
petition
appendix
18a,
he
heard
the
testimony,
he
saw
his
demeanor,
he
didn't
believe
him
and
found
him
in
willful
contempt.
and
finally--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--that
he
did
not
have
the
money.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
that's
our
reading
of
petition
appendix
18a.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
none
of
those
--
you
are
correct;
none
of
those
is
filled
out.
but
what
i
wanted
to
explain
is
that
due
process
looks
at
the
totality
of
the
state
procedures,
and
the
state
has
three
mechanisms
in
place
by
which
petitioner,
having
counsel,
could
have
challenged
this.
he
could
have
challenged
both
the
factual
and
legal
findings
on
appeal.
family
courts
repeatedly
overturn
such--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor.
there
was
no
such
form
provided,
and
there
was
not
a
form--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
whether
in
a
form
or
orally,
a
judge
could
ask
such
questions,
as
justice
sotomayor
pointed
out.
there's
a
form
in
the
appendix.
whether
--
what
happened
here
or
not
is
not
the
question.
the
record
is
insufficient
because
petitioner
didn't
develop
it.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
your
honor.
and
so
to
focus
on--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
--
we
don't
have
good
nationwide
statistics.
what
i
can
say
is
our
understanding
is
that,
first
of
all,
petitioner
is
incorrect
in
saying
that
the
government
has
a
lawyer
here
who
is
prosecuting.
he
is
conflating
the
clerk
of
the
court
issuing
a
ministerial
rule
to
show
cause
with
the
presence
of
a
law-trained
prosecutor.
that
is
not
the
case
in
south
carolina.
that
is
not
the
case
in
very
many
cases.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
it
--
it
is
not
across
the
board.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
we
don't
have
good
statistics
as
to
how
often.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
because
the
state
was
not
a
party--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
well--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--right.
i
don't
know.
all
i
can
say
is,
mrs.
rogers
went
--
anticipating
that
she
would
receive
child
support,
mrs.
rogers
went
off
welfare
in
2003.
after
that
point,
the
state
ceased
to
have
a
direct
financial
interest,
and
the
state
has
written
a
couple
of
letters
in
the
joint
appendix
saying
that
because
we
are
not
a
party
to
the
suit,
our
financial
interest
is
not
directly
implicated.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
broader
systemic
interest,
and
the
state
did,
in
fact,
join
an
amicus
brief
to
that
effect
in
this
case.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
the
closest
is
this
court's
decision
in
st.
pierre.
a
number
of
lower
courts
that
we
cite
have
also
followed
some.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
they
--
no,
your
honor.
in
abortion
cases,
election
cases,
stays
are
practically
impossible.
this
is
a
different
category
of
case,
where
stays
are
available,
and
those
cases
also
seek
prospective
relief.
if
i
might
go
back
to
the
financial
interest
you
pointed
out
earlier,
the
reason
the
state
would
care
here
--
it's
not
that
there's
a
state
fisc
interest
that's
substantial.
but
the
reason
that
matters
to
my
clients
is
because
the
huge
fiscal
burden
here
could
deter
many
states
from
this
enforcement.
in
fact,
it
has.
in
new
jersey,
after
the
state
supreme
court
recognized
in
pasqua
a
right
to
appointed
counsel,
new
jersey
stopped
using
civil
contempt
enforcement.
when
a
state
has
to
appoint
counsel
and
stops
doing
so,
it
removes
deterrence
in
a
massive
number
of
cases.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
we
don't
have
those
numbers,
but
i
also
believe
that's
not
the
correct
inquiry,
your
honor,
because
it's
not
just
the
few
people
who
are
confined.
as
i
was
saying
earlier,
if
the
percentage
of
those
going
to
these
hearings
were
actually
confined
is
in
the
single
digit
percentages,
as
some
of
the
numbers
in
the
state's
appendix
suggest,
then
you're
getting
a
huge
leveraging
effect
of
many
people
being
coerced
into
paying
before
going
into
confinement
or
immediately
after
going
into
confinement,
so
the
state
can
permissibly
weigh
those
costs
and
benefits.
that's
for
the
state
legislature.
to
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
earlier
about
what
due
process
might
require,
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
that
these
procedures
are
straightforward,
informal
procedures,
navigable
by
laymen.
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
when
being
accused
of
not
paying
is
to
say,
but
i
can't
pay,
and
to
follow
it
up
with
an
explanation.
i
applied
for
this
job;
i'm
out
of
work;
i
got
sick.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
we
haven't
looked
at
that,
your
honor,
and
i'm
sure
the
same
arises
in
administrative
appeals
and
small
claims
court,
any
number
of
places.
here
it's
a
simple
intuitive
issue,
and
south
carolina,
like
other
states,
uses
relaxed,
informal
rules
of
evidence
in
procedure.
there
are
effectively
no
rules
of
hearsay
or
authentication.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
your
honor,
and
whether
that's
salutary
or
ought
to
be
considered
in
a
future
case,
it's
not
the
question
here.
that
could
be
worth
exploring.
it
is
much
lower-cost
than
appointing
counsel
across
the
board.
it's
important
to
note--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--i
don't
believe
this
court
has
to
do
that,
your
honor.
in
--
in
cases
such
as
gagnon
and
lassiter,
this
court
laid
out
factors,
said
there's
no
categorical
right
to
counsel,
and
the
lower
courts
--
our
examination
of
the
post-gagnon
cases
suggests
most
of
them
have
said
well,
this
is
a
pretty
routine
case,
85,
90
percent
of
the
time--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--i
--
i
don't
believe
that
it's
necessary
because
we
can't
conceive
of
a
legal
issue
here
so
complex
that
categorically
a
lawyer
is
necessary.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
your
honor.
perhaps
to
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
point,
if
--
if
the
court
were
concerned
about
more
specific
guidance,
it
could
point
to
at
least
in
situations
that
involve
relaxed
informal
rules
of
procedure,
where
no
rules
of
hearsay
authentication,
no
jury
trials,
informal
discovery,
judges
handle
questioning,
no
state
prosecutor,
at
least
there
might
be
no
right
to
counsel.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
well,
then,
the
appropriate
thing
is
to
answer
the
question
that
was
raised
by
petitioner
in
this
case
and
not
to
go
--
no
need
to
go
beyond
that
i
would
suggest.
finally,
let
me
point
out
that
the
closest
analogue
in
the
legal
system
to
the
question
here
about
inability
to
pay
child
support
is
inability
to
afford
counsel.
our
criminal
justice
legal
system
has
extensive
experience
with
that
under
the
cja,
the
criminal
justice
act.
in
the
federal
system
and
in
most
states,
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
show
his
inability
to
pay
counsel.
he
doesn't--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
they're
rubber
stamped.
the
statistics
that
i
have
seen
show
denial
rates
of
10
to
20
percent,
in
some
counties
as
high
as
35
percent.
so
there
is
a
meaningful
inquiry
and
meaningful
denials,
and
all
of
those
cases
would
violate
due
process
on
petitioner's
logic.
that
cannot
be
the
tidal
wave
to
hit
the
criminal
justice
system.
that
is
not
an
appropriate
extension
of
due
process
because
the
issues
here
and
there
are
simpler,
far
simpler
than
in
lassiter,
a
formal
trial-type
adversarial
procedure
where
nevertheless
no
categorical
right
to
counsel
was
required.
it's
important
to
go
back,
if
one
looks
at
the
roots
of
the
right
to
counsel
in
powell
and
gideon
and
zerpst,
powell
talked
about
the
need
for
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
who
are
skilled
in
the
science
of
law
in
order
to
deal
with
technical
defects
in
the
charging
instrument,
to
deal
with
incompetent
irrelevant
or
inadmissible
evidence.
in
proceedings
such
as
this,
where
there
are
no
formal
rules
of
pleading
or
evidence,
there
is
not
a
need
--
certainly
not
a
need
for
a
categorical
right
to
counsel.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
may
i
conclude?
litigants
can
themselves
argue
the
commonsense
issue
of
ability
to
pay,
just
as
they
can
address
their
ability
to
afford
counsel
without
first
having
counsel,
and
the
cost
of
appointing
counsel
across
the
board
would
deter
states
from
enforcing
custodial
parents'
and
their
children's
rights,
as
it
has
in
new
jersey.
thus
this
court
should
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction
or
else
affirm.
