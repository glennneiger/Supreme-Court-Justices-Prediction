justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
my
--
my
question
follows
from
what
i
think
justice
ginsburg
must
have
in
mind.
my
understanding
is
that
it's
a
commonplace
if
the
witness
declines
to
testify
even
though
the
witness
has
immunity,
or
the
attorney
or
the
witness
declines
to
produce
a
document,
the
judge
says
you
will
remain
in
jail
until
you
comply.
in
most
of
the
states
i
think
he's
allowed
counsel;
but
does
the
broad
statement
that
you
--
or
the
broad
argument
that
you
responded,
that
you're
making
when
you
answered
justice
ginsburg's
case,
apply
there,
so
we
are
in
effect
saying
in
all
these
cases
you
must
have
appointed
counsel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
committed
to
custody
until
you
testify.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
"mr.
bailiff,
take
him
out.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--my
concern
is
--
and
it's
been
brought
up
in
some
of
the
other
questions
that
justice
ginsburg
asked
earlier
--
i
just
have
the
sense
that
there
are
thousands
of
these
hearings
around
the
country,
and
they're
--
and
they're
very
important
in
order
to
ensure
child
support,
and
that
if
we
adopt
your
rule,
in
many
cases
where
counsel
are
now
waived
or
not
present
because
of
the
--
the
noncompliant
parent
is
going
to
ask
for
counsel
and
that
we're
going
to
change
the
entire
landscape
of
domestic
relations
proceeding,
the
heisenberg
principle.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
every
case?
i
mean,
doesn't
the
defendant,
or
the
--
or
the
noncompliant
parent
have
to
ask
for
the
counsel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question
is:
do
you
--
are
there
any
data
--
are
there
any
data
to
show
that
in
most
of
these
cases,
counsel
does,
in
fact,
appear?
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
assumption
is
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
correct
for
me
to
think
of
both
the
petitioner's
argument
and
your
response
as
a
mathews
v.
eldridge
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
--
it
does
seem
that
absolute
right
and
mathews
v.
eldridge
is
not
quite
a
--
a
good
fit,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
most
of
mr.
waxman's
arguments
can
be
subsumed
within
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
framework.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
--
just
--
just
assume
that
we
could
somehow
block
out
that
category.
if
you
could
focus
just
on
the
domestic
relations
support
proceedings,
would
there
be
a
basic
change
in
the
way
those
proceedings
are
being
conducted
in
other
states,
if
we
rule
in
favor
of
petitioner
and
say
there's
an
absolute
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
and
i
--
and
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
in
--
in
advance
that
the
judge
and
the
appointing
authority
simply
wouldn't
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
little
difficult
to
write
the
opinion
if
you
are
to
prevail.
see,
there's
no
absolute
right.
but
there
might
be
in
some
other
case,
depending.
we
don't
give
much
help
to
the
system
that
way,
because
it
might
be
that
ultimately
we
would
find
that
the
balancing
test
is
more
complex
than
simply
appointing
the
counsel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you
do
think
we
should
lay
out
the
factors,
and
if
so
what
are
the
factors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
just
don't
know
that
all
those
things
are
properly
before
us.
