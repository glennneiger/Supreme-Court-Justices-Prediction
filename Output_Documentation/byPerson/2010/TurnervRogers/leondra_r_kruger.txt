ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
civil
contempt
proceedings
to
enforce
orders
for
child
support,
due
process
requires
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
simple
and
straightforward
but
critical
question
that
characterizes
remedial
sanctions
in
this
area:
whether
the
nonpaying
parent
has
the
ability
to
pay.
the--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--no,
i
don't
think
you
are,
justice
kagan.
i
think
we
would
say
that
there
are
three
fundamental
requirements
for
due
process
in
this
area.
the
first
is
both
information
regarding
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
that's
going
to
be
made
at
the
hearing--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i'm
sorry.
certainly.
the
first
is
--
as,
justice
sotomayor,
you
referenced
earlier,
the
first
is
information
in
advance
of
the
hearing
that
a
critical
question
to
be
answered
at
the
hearing
is
going
to
concern
ability
to
pay,
and
a
form
or
other
type
of
procedure
that
would
elicit
information
that's
relevant
to
the
alleged
contemnor's
financial
condition.
the
second
would
be
a
hearing
at
which
the
alleged
contemnor
has
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
any
further
inquiries
that
may
be
triggered
by
information
that's
already
been
provided.
this
is,
i
think,
a
common
feature
of
many
systems
outside
of
south
carolina
which,
by
case
law,
have
recognized
that
when
a
court
has
concerns
that
information
on
a
financial
affidavit
might
be
misleading
or
inaccurate,
they
have
a
duty
to
inquire
further
and
to
require
supporting
documentation
as
necessary
to
confirm
or
dispel
concerns
about
the
accuracy
of
the
information.
and
then
finally,
i
think
we
would
require
an
express
finding
that
the
--
the
alleged
contemnor
has
the
ability
to
satisfy
the
purge
conditions
such
that
the
person
can
be
said,
not
only
theoretically,
but
also
realistically,
to
have
the
keys
to
the
jail
cell
in
their
pocket.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that's
right,
and
i
think
it's
also
right
that
south
carolina,
at
least
insofar
as
the
record
reveals,
doesn't
require
a
finding
that
the
alleged
contemnor
has
the
ability
to
comply
with
a
purge
condition,
as
opposed
to
requiring
a
finding
of
willful
violation
of
the
court's
order.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
the
--
the
question
on
the
form
relates
to
a
past
condition,
as
opposed
to
present
ability
to
comply
with
a
purge
condition.
so
the
two
inquiries
are
distinct.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
justice--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--if
he
can't
pay--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
do
know
what
you
mean.
i
understand
you,
justice
scalia.
i
think
there's
two
separate
questions,
both
of
which
concern
ability
to
pay,
but
one
is
retrospective
and
the
other
is
prospective.
the
question
whether
the
alleged
contemnor
has
willfully
violated
a
child
support
order
is
a
retrospective
question.
during
the
--
the
alleged
contemnor
missed
child
support
payments
because
he
wasn't
gainfully
employed
and
didn't
have
the
ability
to
comply.
then
the
question
for
purposes
of
determining
an
appropriate
sanction
is
does
this
person
have
the
present
ability
to
comply,
such
that
sending
that
person
to
jail
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
induce
them
to
--
to--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--carry
out
their
financial
obligations.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
that
there
is
no
categorical
right
to
appointed
counsel
in
all
civil
contempt
proceedings
or--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
one
place
you
can
look
in
order
to
see
what
--
features
states
are
employing.
we
know
anecdotally
from
talking
to
individuals
who
are
responsible
for
running
programs
in
individual
states
that
they
do
ordinarily,
even
in
states
that
don't
categorically
require
the
appointments
of
counsel,
satisfy
each
of
the
three
procedural
protections
that
i
outlined
earlier
in
response
to
justice
kagan.
so,
for
example,
in
new
mexico,
which
hasn't
recognized
a
categorical
right
to
appointed
counsel,
there
is
a
solicitation
of
financial
information
in
advance
of
the
hearing.
that
information
is
reviewed
by
a
caseworker,
who
will
make
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
refer
the
case
to
civil
contempt
proceedings.
there
is
a
hearing
at
which
further
information
is
explored
or
elicited,
and
ultimately
there's
a
determination
made
whether
the
alleged
contemnor
has
the
ability
to
comply.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
it
would
certainly
be
open
to
the
court
to
consider
whether
or
not
having
the
assistance
of
a
layperson
who
may
not
necessarily
be
a
lawyer
would
be
a
requirement
of
due
process,
but
i
think
given
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
which
goes
to
financial
condition,
it's
the
kind
of
information
that
individuals
provide
on
a
regular
basis
without
the
assistance
of
either
competent
lay
people
or
lawyers
with
legal
expertise.
it
seems
unnecessary
to
satisfy
the
commands
of
fundamental
fairness
in
order
to
create
that
requirement
across
the
board;
in
much
the
same
way
i
think
it's
unnecessary
to
appoint
counsel
in
every
case
as
opposed
to
taking
the
modest
and
relatively
inexpensive
steps
that
we've
outlined
in
order
to
ensure
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
don't
think
it
would,
justice
ginsburg,
but
precisely
what
the
form
would
contain
would
have
to
be
tailored
to
the
law
in
the
relevant
jurisdiction.
so
where
the
determination
is
made
on
the
basis
of
assets
and
income,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
form
to
elicit
that
information.
where
in
other
jurisdictions
the
law
is
clear
that
the
other
information
may
be
relevant
to
that
inquiry,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
form
to
elicit
that
information
as
well.
but
i
think
in
substance
the
form
would
look
very
much
like
the
form
that
this
court
sees
on
a
regular
basis
attached
to
its
petitions
for
writs
of
certiorari,
and
would
also
look
very
much
like
forms
that
are
commonly
applied
in
jurisdictions
across
the
country
in
child
support
programs
in
order
to
establish
the
amounts
of
child
support
obligation
in
the
first
place.
south
carolina
employs
such
a
form
for
that
purpose,
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
relatively
trivial
matter
for
south
carolina
to
use
a
similar
form
for
the
purpose
of
enforcement.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
there
is
in
some,
but
not
all,
justice
kagan.
it's
true
that
the
state
is
often,
though
not
always
represented
in
these
proceedings,
not
always
by
lawyers
as
opposed
to
caseworkers
or
other
nonlawyer
personnel
who
work
for
the
departments
of
social
services.
