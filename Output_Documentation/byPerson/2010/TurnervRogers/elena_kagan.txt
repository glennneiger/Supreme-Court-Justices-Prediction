mr.
waxman--
justice
elena
kagan
--suppose
the
court
thinks
that
--
suppose
the
court
looks
at
this
record
and
thinks
this
is
a
broken
system
and
a
violation
of
due
process,
but
requiring
a
counsel
in
every
case
may
go
too
far,
and
there
may,
in
fact,
be
alternate
procedures
that
a
state
could
adopt
that
would
comply
with
due
process.
and
i
know
that
this
is
not
your
submission,
it's
instead
the
solicitor
general's
submission,
but
if
pressed
on
that
point,
what
procedures
do
you
think
would
be
capable
of
giving
a
person
in
this
situation
a
fair
shake
at
this?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
kruger,
you
say
that
the
procedures
here
were
inadequate,
but
that
counsel
in
every
case
is
not
necessarily
required.
you
say
alternate
procedures
can
provide
people
in
this
situation
with
a
fair
shake.
but
then
when
you
look
at
the
procedures
that
you
actually
say
would
comply
with
due
process,
they
are
remarkably
anemic.
basically,
you
say
that
a
form
has
to
be
provided.
you
don't
require
that
there
be
anybody
attached
to
the
court,
the
kind
of
person
that
justice
powell
might
have
been
talking
about
in
vitek,
some
kind
of
caseworker
to
assist
the
person
with
whatever
questions
he
might
have
about
the
form
or
about
how
to
fill
it
out.
you
don't
require
that
the
court
make
any
findings.
you
don't
require
that
the
court
even
ask
any
questions.
apparently,
your
idea
of
the
procedure
is
just
to
give
a
person
a
form.
am
i
reading
you
right?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
kruger,
could
you
say
a
bit
more
about
the
question
that
mr.
waxman
and
justice
scalia
were
talking
about:
how
often
these
proceedings
have
the
state
on
one
side,
how
often
they
have
the
custodial
parent
on
one
side,
whether
there
is
counsel
for
the
opposite
side
in
many
of
these
cases?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
we
couldn't
really
tell,
could
we,
mr.
bibas?
because
he
completely
ignored
the
question.
the
entire
transcript
is
less
than
two
pages
long.
mr.
turner
talked
about
how
he
had
no
money
and
he
was
disabled.
the
court
completely
ignored
him.
the
court
also
ignored
the
questions
on
the
form
for
the
order
of
contempt
about
whether
he
had
any
money.
the
court
ignored
that
as
well.
justice
elena
kagan
practically
when
those
forms
are
used,
the
person
fills
out
a
form,
and
mostly
they're
just
accepted,
aren't
they?
