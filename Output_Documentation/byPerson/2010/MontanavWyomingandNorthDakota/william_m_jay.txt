mr.
william
m.
jay
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
entered
an
order
stating
that
it
would
hold
oral
argument
only
on
montana's
first
exception,
and
that
the
second
exception
would
be
recommitted
to
the
special
master.
so
for
that
--
for
that
reason
the
parties
have
addressed
only
the
first
exception
in
this
argument
today.
mr.
william
m.
jay
both
of
their
pre-1950
users
have
to
be
satisfied
first,
yes,
we
agree
with
that,
so
that
no
one
in
wyoming
is
supposed
to
be
taking
post-1950
water
until
pre-1950
users
in
montana
are
satisfied.
we
agree
with
that.
the
--
the
point
on
which
--
that
the
court
has
sent
back
to
the
special
master
is
what
happens
if
pre-1950
users
in
montana
are
not
satisfied
but
they
could
be
because
montana
post-1950
users
in
montana
are
also
diverting
water.
but
what
we
think
the
--
the
question
squarely
before
the
court
here
is
whether
the
right
to
recapture
water
gained
from
increased
efficiency
is
part
of
the
pre-1950
appropriative
right,
and
that
matters
when
there's
not
enough
water
in
the
river
for
both
states
to
satisfy
their
pre-1950
appropriative
rights.
forget
about
post-1950's,
there's
not
enough
water.
mr.
william
m.
jay
both
states
have
affirmatively
rejected
the
idea
of
a
middle
ground
like
that,
justice
breyer--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well
--
well,
justice
breyer,
we
--
we
submit
that
enforcing
the
compact
according
what
--
what
the
states
signed
up
for
is--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--precisely.
mr.
william
m.
jay
provided
they--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--and
here
the
states
decided
not
to
do
that
on
an
interstate
basis.
they
said
that
--
that
all
pre-1950
users
would
be
on
the
same
footing
as
between
the
states.
so
that
montana
cannot
complain
if
--
as
long
as
wyoming's
water
users
pre-1950
are
not
exceeding
their
pre-1950
right,
montana
has
no
remedy
and
there
is
no
breach.
they
concede
that
on
page
20
of
that
surreply.
mr.
william
m.
jay
under
this
compact,
justice
ginsburg,
the
appropriative
rights
existing
in
each
signatory
state
as
of
january
1st,
1950
are
water
preserved
and
carried
for
by
article
v(a).
each
water
user
in
--
in
each
state
has
exactly
the
same
rights
that
he
had
on
january
1st,
1950.
now,
in
montana
perhaps
that
might
not
include
the
right
to
recapture
efficiencies;
but
we
know,
for
example,
that
--
that
a
montana
water
user
could
divert
more
water
per
acre
because
montana
had
a
more
generous
concept
of
beneficial
use
for
irrigation
per
acre
than
wyoming
did.
the
compact
simply
carries
forward
all
existing
appropriative
rights,
and
the
drafters
consciously
rejected
the
idea
that
they
should
come
up
with
some
kind
of
interstate
administration
system
putting
the
two
states'
rights
on
equal
footing.
they
carried
forward
each
element
in
the
bundle
of
sticks
that
a
rights
holder
had
on
january
1st,
1950,
subject
to
the
single
override
of
the
definition
of
beneficial
use;
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that
because
justice
scalia's
colloquy
with
mr.
michael
brought
that
out.
in
article
ii(h)
there's
a
definition
of
beneficial
use.
what
the
compact's
definition
of
beneficial
use
does
is
specify
that
nondepletive
uses
don't
count.
hydropower
is
a
classic
example.
hydropower
in
the
main
channel
is
something
that
one
could
get
an
appropriative
right
for
under
some
western
water
law.
mr.
william
m.
jay
ii(h),
which
is
on
page
a4
to
the
appendix
to
the
special
master's
report.
that's
the
definition
of
beneficial
use.
what
it
does
not
do
is
specify
that
depletion
is
the
measure
of
beneficial
use.
it
says
beneficial
use
is
not
the
use
to
the
extent
that
the
water
supply
is
depleted;
it's
the
use
--
it's
a
use
by
which
the
water
supply
is
depleted.
because
irrigation
means
water
goes
out
and
doesn't
come
--
and
some
of
it
doesn't
come
back,
irrigation
is
a
depletive
use.
it's
recognized
by
the
compact.
mr.
william
m.
jay
but
a
mill
race
would,
justice
scalia.
a
mill
race
takes
water
out
of
the
river.
you
turn
the
wheel
of
your
grist
mill
with
it,
and
then
the
water
comes
back
to
the
river.
mr.
william
m.
jay
yes,
that's
a
diversion,
but
not
a
depletion.
mr.
william
m.
jay
but
the
--
the
point,
justice
scalia,
article
v(a)
doesn't
use
diversion,
and
that
--
that's
precisely
the
point,
it
doesn't
use
diversion;
it
uses
--
it
uses
beneficial
use.
and
any
--
any--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--because
they
--
it
didn't
use
diversion
because
it
wasn't
quantifying
them.
where
--
what
diversion
is
used
in
article
v(b)
because
the
diversion
is--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--it's
not
quantified
in
the
sense
--
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
no
one
--
they
didn't
write
down,
especially
in
montana,
because
as
the
special
master
said
on
page
22,
montana
didn't
have
a
centralized
system
of
rights;
they
didn't
know
exactly
how
much
was
being
diverted
in
montana.
they
certainly
didn't
know
how
much
was
being
consumed
or
how
much
was
being
returned
to
the
river.
joint
appendix
585
there's
a
federal
power
commission
report
that
says
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
make
an
accurate
determination
of
return
flow.
so
what
--
what
the
drafters
did
was
they,
for
the
pre-1950
rights,
they
said
we're
not
going
to
cap
--
quantify
them
at
all,
we're
going
to
grandfather
them
in,
freeze
them
in
place.
mr.
william
m.
jay
my
argument,
justice
--
my
argument,
justice
breyer,
is
that
they
didn't
want
mill
races
or
hydropower
to
count.
mr.
william
m.
jay
they
used
the
word
depletion,
but
they
didn't
make
the
amount
of
depletion
the
measurement
--
that
is
the
point.
mr.
william
m.
jay
a
mill
race
is
a
diversion
under
the
common
understanding
of
that
term,
justice
scalia.
it
may--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--no,
not
under
the
special
definition
used
for
article
v(b),
but--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--that
--
that
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
that
has
always
been
the
case
under
western
water
law
that
the
appropriative
right
is
a
priority,
that
when
it's
your
turn
and
there's
enough
water,
you
get
to
take
the
amount
of
water
to
which
you
have
a
right.
but
it
was
clear
in
wyoming
on
january
1st,
1950
that
the
appropriative
right
--
so
long
as
you
took
the
same
quantity
from
the
river,
you
took
it
from
the
same
point
on
the
river,
you
put
it
to
the
same
use,
irrigation,
on
the
same
acreage
--
that
you
could
then
change
crops,
for
example.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
--
i
think
that
that's
right.
i
think
i
agree,
justice
kennedy,
but
it
has
to
be
a
depletive
use
in
the
sense
that
some
water
--
some
water
has
to
come
out
that
doesn't
come
back.
so
it's
not
--
it's
not
the
same
--
the
mill
--
a
mill
race
is
not
a
depletion,
even
though
some
water,
some
water
comes
out
because
it
then
--
because
it
then
comes
back.
mr.
william
m.
jay
the
reason
it's
irrelevant,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
--
for
two
reasons.
depletion
is
not
the
measure
of
beneficial
use.
it's
a
--
it
is
a
criterion
for
beneficial
use.
the
use
has
to
be
a
depletive
one;
but
it's
not
the
measure
of
the
beneficial
use.
and
the
second
point,
montana
seeks
to
equate
consumption
with
depletion,
and
that's
just
--
that's
not
correct,
either.
we
urge
the
court
to
overrule
the
exception.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
