justice

g.

given
the
same
conditions.
but
is
there
any
evidence,
or
can
you
say
anything
from
the
record
or
any
other
place,
going
back
to
1950
--
i
assume
in
1950
people
knew
how
much
the
different
landowners
were
taking
out
of
the
stream
of
the
river
in
wyoming
to
use
for
irrigation
and
other
such
purposes.
they
knew
that.
is
there
any
indication
they
knew
at
that
time
how
much
each
individual
landowner
was
putting
back?
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
but
i
would
be
very
interested
if
it's
yes.
and
i
think
it
would
help
you
a
lot
if
it's
yes,
because
i'm
--
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i'm
pretty
skeptical
of
the
fact
that
they're
writing
an
appropriation
right
into
this
about
regulating
something
they
don't
even
know
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
didn't
say
it
could
be
yes.
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me
if
the
answer
is
yes,
and
then
of
course
i'm
going
to
ask
you
where
in
the
record
i
find
something
that
says
that
they
knew
how
much
each
individual
landowner
is
putting
back
into
this
river
in
wyoming.
and
i
think
you
can't
answer
that
question,
can
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
they
didn't?
in
other
words,
they
didn't
know
how
much
is
coming
back,
but
you're
coming
in
and
saying
what
they
were
--
what
they
were
regulating
here
is
they're
saying,
not
only
you
get
--
you
maintain
a
right
to
take
out
100,000
units
to
do
your
irrigation,
but
you
have
to
put
back
80,000,
but
they
didn't
even
know
what
the
number
was,
whether
it
was
80,
70,
or
60,
and
the
appropriation
law
is
ambiguous?
i
think
--
i
think
i
can
go
that
far
with
you
to
say
it's
ambiguous,
but
i
don't
see
how
i
can
go
further.
i
mean,
that's
my
basic
question.
did
you
see
what
it
was?
was
i
clear?
i'm
saying,
how
can
you
read
this
treaty
to
require
landowners
to
put
back
amounts
into
the
river
that
they
didn't
even
know
what
they
were?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
think
that
is
what
--
the
answer
is
yes,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
back
where
--
that's
where
i
was
here.
see,
i
can't
get
too
far.
i
mean,
you
have
the
word
"depletion"
in
that
definition.
i
--
i
--
that
might
help
you.
but
i'm
thinking
in
accordance
with
the
doctrine
of
appropriation,
what
does
that
doctrine,
that
legal
doctrine,
say
about
use
and
return?
that's
why
we're
--
we're
--
why
i
was
thinking
it
seems
totally
unclear.
it
talks
about
seepage,
the
cases,
which
i
gather
is
different
from
return.
okay.
so
could
they
have
really
meant
net?
and
what
struck
me
is
that
they
couldn't,
which
--
which
you
were
beginning
to
address,
too,
is
that
they
couldn't
have
meant
net
because
the
water
law
at
that
time
is
unlikely
to
have
meant
net
for
the
reason
that
they
didn't
--
you
don't
know
what's
coming
back.
do
you
see?
it's
not
just
--
i
see
your
point.
your
point
is,
well,
wyoming
knew
how
much
was
going
into
wyoming.
but
that's
not
my
point.
my
point
is
what
--
what's
the
water
law?
what's
the
law
of
appropriation
at
that
time
in
respect
to
return
flows?
and
if
people
didn't
measure
return
flows
in
general,
i
suspect
in
an
ambiguous
area
they
would
have
analogized
it
to
seepage,
which
is
what
the
--
what
the
special
master
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
they--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--uh-huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
obviously
you're
saying
--
to
read
it
with
a
different
emphasis.
justice
scalia
read
it
with
--
beneficial
use
is
that
use
by
which
the
water
supply
of
a
drainage
basin
"is
depleted"
when
usefully
employed
by
the
activities
of
man.
and
you
read
it,
by
which
the
water
supply
of
a
drainage
basin
is
depleted
"when
usefully
employed
by
the
activities
of
man.
"
so
that
it
is
a
definition
in
respect
to
how
you
use
it,
not
amount.
but
if
you
emphasize
the
word
depleted,
it
could
be
read
as
referring
to
amounts,
and
not
quality
of
use,
not
nature.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
on
your
theory
in
that
situation
where
there
isn't
enough
for
all
the
pre-1950
people,
it's
wyoming
that
gets
all
the
water?
and
on
their
theory,
it's
surprising
--
surprise,
surprise
--
it's
montana
that
gets
all
the
water?
[laughter]
and
there's
no
way
to
read
this
contract
--
this
compact
so
it's
share
and
share
alike?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
no
fair
way
to
decide
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
linguistic
argument
is
they
didn't
use
the
word
diversion
because
they
didn't
want
to
throw
the
mill
race
example
into
the
definition;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
want
mill
races
in
the
definition,
so
they
didn't
purposely
use
diversion,
that's
why
they
used
the
word
depletion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct,
and
they
wanted
that.
