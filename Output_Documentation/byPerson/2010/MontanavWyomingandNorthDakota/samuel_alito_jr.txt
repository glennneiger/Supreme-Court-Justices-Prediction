if
your
understanding
is
correct,
would
the
result
be
that
landowners
in
wyoming
would
only
be
allowed
to
consume
as
much
as
they
consumed
in
1950,
but
landowners
in
montana
could
take
advantage
of
improved
irrigation
techniques
and
use
much
more
of
the
--
they
could
divert
the
same
amount
of
water,
but
they
could
use
much
more
of
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
wouldn't
it?
