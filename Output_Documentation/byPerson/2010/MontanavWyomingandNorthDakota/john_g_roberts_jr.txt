chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
now
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
137
on
our
original
docket,
montana
v.
wyoming
and
north
dakota.
general
bullock.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
you've
--
we've
been
talking
about
beneficial
uses.
what
the
compact
said
--
says
is,
appropriative
rights
to
beneficial
uses.
and
to
me
that
suggests,
which
i
always
understood
to
be
the
way
water
law
worked
in
the
west,
is
you
have
a
right
to
pull
out
water,
and
the
appropriative
right
is
you
have
the
right
to
take
out
however
much
you
were
taking
out,
and
the
fact
that
less
comes
back,
that's
something
different.
that
doesn't
affect
your
appropriation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
what's
going
on
here?
the
beneficial
use
is
the
irrigation
of
crops.
they
have
an
appropriative
right
to
take
out
so
much
flow
for
that.
that's
all
they're
doing.
they're
doing
it
now,
just
as
they
were
back
then.
they
just
use
up
more
of
it
once
they've
taken
it
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
why
that's
a
good
--
good
answer.
i
mean,
the
beneficial
use
is
that
use
by
which
the
water
supply
is
depleted.
well,
the
use
here
is
irrigation.
it
doesn't
say
irrigation
up
to
the
technological
development
in
1950.
they're
still
taking
out
the
same
amount
of
water
for
that
beneficial
use.
they're
using
it
to
irrigate.
and
if
they
get
better
at
it
so
they
use
more,
well,
that's
just
too
bad
for
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
michael.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
follow
up
on
justice
kennedy's
point,
because
i
think
it's
important:
so
you
were
reading
--
when
it
says
"is
depleted",
you
think
all
you
have
to
show
is
that
it's
less
than
when
you
started,
and
once
that
is
shown,
it
is
depleted.
then
you're
saying,
but
we
can
deplete
as
much
as
we
want?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
don't
care
how
much?
you're
saying
this
is
a
beneficial
use
because
it
depletes
some
of
the
water,
it
takes
some
away,
and
once
we
have
gotten
over
that
hurdle,
all
bets
are
off
and
we
can
deplete
as
much
as
we
want.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
to
get
back
to
the
point,
wouldn't
the
normal
word
be
"divert"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
before
you
sit
down,
i
don't
know
why
you
think
we
have
deferred
the
remedy
question?
it's
presented.
it's
been
briefed.
i
don't
know
why
you
think
we've
deferred
it.
whether
or
not
montana
has
to
take
care
of
intrastate
uses,
that's
what
i
understand
the
remedy
question
to
be.
you
briefed
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
thank
you.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
jay,
maybe
you
can
help
clarify
something.
the
--
the
second
question
presented,
which
involves
what
montana
has
to
do
before,
that's
still
before
us,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
you
want
us
--
you
don't
want
us
to
reach
it,
but
it's
still
before
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
that
was
the
way
appropriation
law
works
in
the
west,
i
mean,
the
person
who
gets
it,
gets
it?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
i
don't
mean
--
isn't
that
the
difference
between
eastern
water
law
and
western
water
law?
in
the
east
you
try
to
allocate
everything
fairly
so
everyone
is
treated
fairly,
and
i
thought
in
the
west,
for
reasons
of
efficiency,
it's
first
come
first
serve.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
keep
saying
everybody
gets
the
same
beneficial
use
they
had
prior
to
1950,
but
--
even
though
that
may
mean
they
can't
do
it.
in
other
words
they
may
have
a
right
to
get
50
cubic
whatever
for
irrigation,
but
there
may
not
be
any
water
there
for
them
to
use
it
because
of
the
increased
efficiencies
upstream.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
jay.
general,
you
have
two
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
