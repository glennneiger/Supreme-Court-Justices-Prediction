justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
doesn't
the
language
in
article
v(a)
--
and
this
is
not
too
helpful
--
simply
restate
the
issue
before
us,
what
is
a
beneficial
use
by
the
upstream
owner?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
all
that
shows
is
--
or
might
show
in
a
particular
case,
is
that
the
amount
of
water
is
reduced.
now
--
then
the
question
is
have
the
senior
appropriators
or
the
upstream
appropriators
reduced
it
in
a
way
that's
inconsistent
or
that's
an
overuse
of
their
beneficial
rights,
and
you're
right
--
again
right
where
we
started
from.
and
then
you
have
to
regulate
exactly
how
each
irrigator
is
using
the
appropriative
rights.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
--
so
the
flows
don't
necessarily
answer
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you
referred
us,
just
while
you're
going
through
your
notes,
to
page
82,
and
there's
an
intriguing
footnote
where
the
special
master
talks
about
his
own
--
his
own
book.
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
conclusive
on
your
point,
because
he's
saying
the
area
is
confused.
and
his
point
it
seems
he
brings
up
what
the
special
--
i'm
taking
over
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question.
it
is
page
282.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
footnote
on
that
page,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
ultimate
liability
to
montana
--
pardon
me,
to
north
dakota
for
overuse?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
won't
--
i
won't
get
into
that,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
chief
justice
asked
the
question,
if
you're
entitled
to
take
the
water,
you
can
use
it
for
any
purpose.
i
--
i
--
i
take
it
the
answer
to
that
is
it
has
to
be
a
beneficial
use,
it
has
to
be
for
approximately
the
same
crop,
but
that
brings
us
to
this
--
to
this
gray
area
that
the
special
master
refers
to
on
page
82
as
confusing.
and
i
think,
was
it
page
65
he
talks
about
this
is
a
confusing
area
of
the
law?
what
is
your
best
authority
for
your
position?
what
is
the
--
do
you
have
a
case
or
a
--
a
--
a
paragraph
in
a
treatise
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
utah
case
is
your
best
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
is
the
controlling
principle
in
answering
the
question
that
i
think
you
properly
put?
could
these
irrigators
switch
to
something
like
rice
which
absorbs
a
tremendous
amount
of
water,
or
are
they
--
when
they
switch
crops
it
must
be
reasonably
close
to
the
earlier
beneficial
use?
what
is
--
what
is
the
standard
that
we
look
to,
to
answer
that
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
standard
of?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
first
--
suppose
the
first
crop
absorbs
50
percent
of
the
water
and
returns
50
percent
by
seepage.
the
second
crop
that
they
switch
to
still
absorbs
just
50
percent
of
the
water
but
because
of
the
--
of
the
pattern,
the
other
50
percent
just
evaporates?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
addressing
the
word
depleted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
"depleted"
means
only
what's
withdrawn
and
it's
not
calculated
by
--
with
reference
to
what
is
returned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
once
again,
you're
saying
that
depletion
is
a
calculation
of
what
is
taken
without
reference
to
what
returns?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
best
authority
for
that
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
--
and
this
is
ii--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
ii
--
in
ii(h),
do
you
think
beneficial
use
is
hereby
defined
as
--
by
which
water
supply
is
depleted
--
we're
looking
at
"depleted".
do
you
define
depleted
as
what
is
taken
without
any
reference
to
what
is
returned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
that
--
that's
the
key
to
this
case,
i
take
it.
wyoming
is
telling
us
that
what
goes
back
is
irrelevant
so
long
as
what
is
taken
is
for
a
recognized
beneficial
use?
