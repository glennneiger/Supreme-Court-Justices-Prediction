justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
under
our
original
jurisdiction.
with
congress's
consent,
montana
and
wyoming
agreed
to
the
yellowstone
river
pact
in
1951.
under
this
pact,
the
states
agreed
that
water
rights
existing
in
each
state
as
of
1950
would
continue
to
be
enjoyed
in
accordance
with
the
doctrine
of
appropriation.
in
2008,
montana
sued
wyoming
alleging
that
it
had
breached
the
compact
in
several
ways
by
using
more
than
its
agreed
upon
share
of
the
water.
only
one
of
montana's
allegations
is
before
us
today.
the
claim
that
by
installing
more
efficient
sprinkler
irrigation
systems,
wyoming
water
users
have
reduced
their
runoff.
as
a
result,
less
water
returns
to
the
river
and
less
water
reaches
montana
than
it
did
in
1950.
montana
claims
that
wyoming
has
therefore
violated
the
compact.
the
special
master
reappointed
found
that
montana's
allegations
failed
to
state
a
claim.
montana
filed
an
exception.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
overrule
montana's
exception
to
the
special
master's
report.
the
yellowstone
river
compact
preserves
water
rights
“in
accordance
with
the
laws
governing
the
acquisition
and
use
of
water
under
the
doctrine
of
appropriation”.
under
that
doctrine,
efficient
sprinkler,
irrigation
systems
are
permissible
even
if
they
cause
a
net
increase
in
water
consumption.
this
is
true
so
long
as
the
sprinkler
users
do
not
increase
the
amount
of
water
they
divert
from
the
river
or
use
the
conserved
water
to
irrigate
new
acreage.
accordingly,
montana's
allegations
that
wyoming
has
violated
the
compact
by
merely
allowing
the
installation
of
more
efficient
sprinkler
systems
fails
to
state
a
claim.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
