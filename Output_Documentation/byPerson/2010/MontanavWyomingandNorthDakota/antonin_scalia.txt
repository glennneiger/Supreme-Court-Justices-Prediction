justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
you
get
the
same
amount
of
water
and
it's
up
to
--
it's
up
to
wyoming
to
figure
out
who
they
have
to
cut
down
for
not
putting
back
enough
to
meet
that
amount?
you
don't
care
what
private
owner
it
comes
from?
it's
up
to
wyoming
to
figure
out
who
has
to
be
cut
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
trying
to
help
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
like
water
supplies,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
say
what
you
say
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
your
people
can
do
that.
your
people
can
get
more
use
out
of
the
same
amount
of
water
diverted
by
going
to
sprinkler
irrigation,
whereas
the
people
in
wyoming
can't.
that's
a
little
unfair,
it
seems
to
me.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
people
are
entitled
to
take
out
the
same
amount
they
took
out
before,
right?
pre-1950?
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
the
people
in
wyoming,
you
say,
are
not
entitled
to
take
out
the
same
amount;
they
are
entitled
only
net
the
same
amount
that
they
had
before.
whereas
downstream
your
people
can
take
out
the
same
amount
and
whereas
before
20
percent
of
it
used
to
go
back
into
the
stream,
they
can
now
make
use
of
that
whole
20
percent
through
sprinkler
irrigation,
right?
it
gives
you
a
great
advantage.
i
mean,
maybe
that's
the
way
it
was
written,
but
--
but
don't
tell
me
that
this
is
even-handed,
because
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
would
think
your
best
point
is
not
all
of
that
stuff,
but
simply
the
definition
section,
which
very
clearly
makes
a
distinction
between
beneficial
use
and
diversion.
and
your
point
is
that
what
is
guaranteed
is
not
the
diversion
right
that
existed
pre-1950,
but
the
beneficial
use
right,
which
is
the
net
use
of
the
water,
not
--
not
the
total
amount
diverted.
if
--
if
there
were
not
both
of
those
definitions,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
little
--
your
case
would
be
a
little
harder.
but
with
the
two
of
those
definitions
there
and
with
v(a)
using
beneficial
use
rather
than
--
it
could
have
said
diversion,
appropriative
right
to
diversion,
but
it
didn't
say
that.
it
said
to
beneficial
use.
well,
why
--
why
define
beneficial
use
that
way
if
you
don't
mean
it?
that's
your
best
point,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
was
that
again,
where
at?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we're
dealing
here
with
a
compact
which
has
a
text,
and
--
and
what
the
water
law
of
wyoming
or
of
montana
happened
to
be
cannot
overrule
the
text,
and
i
am
--
i'm
hung
up
on
the
fact
that
article
v(a)
says
appropriated
rights
to
the
beneficial
uses
of
the
water
of
the
yellowstone
river
system
existing
as
of
january
1,
1950:
appropriated
rights
not
to
diversion,
not
to
diversion
for
beneficial
uses,
but
appropriated
rights
to
the
beneficial
uses,
which
is
defined
--
which
is
defined
in
the
compact
to
say
that
use
by
which
the
water
supply
of
a
drainage
basin
is
depleted
when
usefully
employed.
and
it
could
have
said
diversion,
but
it
didn't
say
that,
and
i
notice
that
the
government's
brief
uses
--
seems
to
use
the
words
interchangeably,
depletion
and
diversion.
they're
not
interchangeable.
they're
defined
quite
separately
in
this
thing;
and
besides
which
i
find
it
implausible
that
montana
signed
on
to,
"we
don't
know
how
much
water
we're
going
to
get,
it
depends,
you
know,
upon
how
much
stuff
was
--
was
flowing
back
before,
but
we're
not
guaranteed
that
that
will
be
flowing
back
again.
"
you
combine
those
two
things,
and
i
--
i
--
what
do
you
do
about
that
definition?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
how
it's
defined.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
emphasize
both
of
them?
i'm
willing
to
emphasize
both,
but
you
can't
write
out
the
"depleted"
out
of
the
--
how
does
your
definition
of
depleted
differ
from
--
from
diversion?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
diversion
for
a
beneficial
use
the
same
thing
as
a
depletion?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i
mean,
to
--
to
do
that,
the
definition
would
have
read
the
term
beneficial
use
is
defined
to
be
that
use
by
which
the
water
--
that
use
by
which
the
water
--
that
use
"for
which"
the
water
supply
of
a
drainage
basin
is
diverted,
for
useful
employment
by
the
activities
of
man,
and
that's
not
what
it
says.
to
the
contrary,
it
makes
a
clear
distinction
between
depletion
and
the
previous
definition
of
diversion.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
trying
to
give
that
stark
difference
some
effect
in
the
later
sections
of
v(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
where
--
what
part
of
v(b)
are
you
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
point
of
measurement
shall
be
below
the
last
diversion?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
--
exactly.
i
mean,
there
it
talks
about
diversions
for
beneficial
use
and
not
depletion
for
beneficial
use.
i
mean,
i
think
that's
something
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
person
who
doesn't
get
it,
gets
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
hydropower
would
--
would
not
constitute
a
diversion.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that
--
that's
a
diversion.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
means
the
taking
or
removing
of
water
when
the
water
so
taken
or
removed
is
not
returned
directly
into
the
channel
of
the
yellowstone
river.
so
if
you
have
a
mill
race,
the
water
comes
through
the
mill
race,
goes
right
back;
it's
--
it's
not
even
a
diversion.
you
don't
have
to
qualify
as
a
beneficial
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
it
use
diversion
if
it
means
what
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
it's
quantified.
i
mean
the
whole
purpose
is
you
can't
take
any
more
than
you
were
taking
before.
it
has
to
be
quantified
somehow.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
mill
race
is
not
a
diversion.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
under
the
definition.
