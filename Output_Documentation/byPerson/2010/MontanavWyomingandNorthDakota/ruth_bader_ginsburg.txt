justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
bullock,
would
you
please
point
to
the
precise
language
of
the
compact
that
freezes
consumption,
as
distinguished
from
the
amount
of
water
diverted,
which
freezes
consumption
as
of
january
1st,
1950?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
uses
existing
is
irrigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
where
it
says,
and
so
i
can
understand,
the
amount
of
water
diverted
can't
be
increased.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
happens
under
montana
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general,
assume
that
you're
right,
that
what
was
guaranteed
was
the
same
amount
of
water
flowing
into
montana
as
in
1950,
and
i
--
i
take
it
you
don't
care
how
wyoming
deals
with
this,
but
what
--
if
you're
right,
what
could
wyoming
do?
it
can't
tell
the
--
the
farmers,
go
back
to
the
old
way
of
irrigating
or
go
back
to
a
different
crop?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you
say
it
doesn't
--
they
don't
--
wyoming
doesn't
have
to
know
whether
farmer
a
or
farmer
b
is
taking
more
than
they
took
in
1950
--
i
mean,
is
using
more
than
they
used
in
1950;
they
just
have
to
know
what
the
total
amount
is,
and
wyoming
can
make
that
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jay,
i
thought
that
the
special
master,
very
important
to
him
was
the
meaning
of
a
appropriate
--
appropriative
rights,
and
he
said
that
the
wyoming
law
is
just
as
you've
described,
that
is,
the
farmer
can
use
all
that
water;
and
he
said
montana
law
is
uncertain,
but
wyoming
law
is
not
out
of
line
with
the
general
approach.
suppose
it
had
been
a
case,
suppose
montana
law,
instead
of
being
uncertain,
was
diametrically
opposite
wyoming
law,
then
what
happens
under
this
compact?
