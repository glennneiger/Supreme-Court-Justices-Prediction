justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
essence
of
the
argument
before
us.
the
depletion
was
the
amount
of
water
that
was
taken
from
this
water
source
to
irrigate
the
crops.
the
--
the
issue
now
before
us
is
whether
beneficial
use
means
consumption
or
it
means
use,
isn't
it?
i
--
you're
begging
the
question
in
my
mind,
because
i
don't
--
what
source
do
you
have
for
the
fact
that
a
return
flow
is
beneficial
use?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
not
actually
true.
their
water
right
was
the
beneficial
use
that
your
pre-1950
consumers
used,
meaning
you
had
consumers
who
were
irrigating
their
own
crops
who
were
doing
other
things
with
the
water.
the
rights
protected
are
their
pre-1950
uses.
you're
putting
--
you're
--
you're
still
equating
consumption
as
--
as
being
their
use,
but
i
don't
know
where
you
get
that
equation
from.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
use.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
uh-huh.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
someone
pre-1950
who
irrigated
crops
change
the
crops?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
in
the
world
do
any
states
monitor
that?
the
change
in
crops,
the
change
in
irrigation
methods,
the
change
in
anything
that
would
cause
a
difference
in
return
flow?
let's
assume
global
warming
in
some
form
or
another
evaporated
more
water,
and
so
some
crop
area
did
some
solar
heating
that
caused
a
greater
evaporation.
is
that
a
breach
of
the
compact?
so
two
questions
embedded
in
there.
how
does
any
state
monitor
that,
the
change
in
crops
or
change
in
irrigation
methods?
and,
second,
how
far
does
it
go
in
terms
of
the
pre-1950s
right
to
use
their
water?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
really
--
i'm
sorry.
the
issue
is,
are
both
of
you
--
both
of
you
have
pre
and
post-1950
users?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
and
i
--
i
guess
this
goes
to
the
second
question,
which
was
sort
of
not
really
addressed.
the
special
master
said,
well,
you
could
cut
back
your
post-1950
users
and
satisfy
all
of
the
needs
of
your
pre-1950
users.
why
isn't
that
the
answer?
why
isn't
that
an
answer
that
should
be
respected,
because
you
can
satisfy
all
of
the
pre-1950
needs
that
you
have
potentially?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
before
any
1950
use,
post-1950
users
are
permitted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
this
a
premature
lawsuit?
because
i
think
really
the
essence
of
your
claim
is
we
need
the
pre-1950
water
flow.
we
don't
care
who
it
comes
from.
and
what
--
all
the
special
master
said,
in
my
mind,
was
the
difference
--
you
can't
look
to
what
the
pre-1950s
were
doing
in
this
situation,
but
i
haven't
addressed
what
the
posts
are
going
to
do
or
have
been
doing
and
whether
that's
right,
and
that's
depriving
you
of
the
water
flow.
i
don't
know
if
he
answered
that
question:
are
you
in
fact
entitled
to
a
minimum
amount
of
water
flow?
that's
really
what
should
be
the
point
of
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--excuse--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
could
i
--
could
you
answer,
do
you
see
a
difference?
finish
that,
and
then
could
i
just
clarify
something
from
what
you
were
just
reading?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
could
i
go
back
to
my
question,
which
is
twofold?
the
first
is,
the
solicitor
general
recommends
that
we
defer
the
decision
on
remedies
in
this
case,
and
montana
seems
to
agree.
do
you
agree
as
well?
the
second
question
presented.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
my
problem
with
this
is
--
and
i
think
i
need
to
understand
what
the
fight
is
about
here,
or
what
the
dispute
is
about
--
it
really
does
seem
to
me
that
it
is
a
question
of
remedies,
not
about
whether
you're
taking
more
water
rights
through
irrigation
or
not.
if
i
understand
this
compact
right,
both
of
you
are
protected
in
your
pre-1950
beneficial
uses.
each
of
you
appear,
under
the
terms
of
article
v,
to
be
entitled
to
get
enough
water
to
fill
those
uses.
the
next
section,
the
one
that
you
read
earlier,
lets
you
use
things
in
the
future
for
post-1950
uses,
but
only
if
the
water
supply's
protected
pre-1950
beneficial
uses
have
received
all
they're
entitled
to.
neither
of
you
are
entitled
or
--
to
take
anything
post-1950
until
pre-1950
is
protected.
that's
how
i
read
article
v.
am
i
reading
it
wrong?
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
time
that
we
get
into
a
dispute
--
and
this
is
the
part
that
i
think
your
adversary
may
be
right
about,
ultimately
--
is
it's
not
a
consumptive
compact,
but
it's
a
use
compact,
and
both
of
you
are
entitled
to
get
a
full
--
that's
what
i'm
reading
article
v
to
say,
to
get
enough
water
to
satisfy
the
beneficial
uses
before
anybody's
entitled
to
post-1950
water.
tell
me
what
in
the
language
of
article
v
suggests
something
different
than
that
understanding.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
this
is
not
happening
today,
is
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right,
but
that's
an
isolated
year.
in
most
years,
are
you
putting
water
to
post-1950
use
--
to
post-1950
uses
or
not?
have
you
been
regularly
putting
water
to
post-1950
uses?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
disagree.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
disagree,
but
as
i
read
the
article,
it
says,
you
put
all
the
water
that's
available
to
pre-1950
appropriated
uses.
you
then
go,
as
i
read
the
second
part
of
this
article,
to
any
water
supplies
that
each
state
has
until
you
fulfill
those
1950
appropriated
uses.
and
then
it
apportions,
between
the
two
of
you,
post-1950
percentages
of
the
excess
water
that
you're
entitled
to
have.
am
i
correct
about
that
structure?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
why
--
i
do
understand
the
remedies
were
deferred,
but
to
the
extent
that
we
were
to
rule
that
appropriated
rights
included
the
right
to
change
irrigation
methods
or
crops
--
we
don't
have
to
reach
crops,
because
that's
not
at
issue
here
--
in
the
end,
you're
only
entitled
to
take
the
appropriated
uses,
including
irrigation
rights,
that
existed
pre-1950.
are
they
entitled
to
get
as
much
water
as
necessary
to
satisfy
their
pre-1950
rights
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
before
you
can
use
post-1950
water?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
aren't
you
taking
more
of
the
percentage
that
way
of
post-1950
waters?
the
compact
says,
post-1950,
you
can
take
whatever
percentage
it
was.
i've
forgotten
what
percentage
that
might
have
been.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
whatever
it
was.
60
percent;
they're
entitled
to
40.
does
that
mean
you
can
take
a
hundred
percent,
because
there
happens
to
be
more
water
that
they
can
satisfy
the
pre-1950's
users
with?
why
aren't
they
entitled
to
their
40
percent
of
whatever
that
big
basin
is
so
they
can
give
more
water
to
post-1950
users,
that
they
can
exploit
their
full
40
percent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
answering
this
only
--
i'm
asking
this
because
i
know
we've
deferred
decision
on
the
remedy,
but
for
me
that
is
so
integral
to
the
issue
here
because
when
they
talk
about
being
entitled
to
a
water
flow,
i
see
that
as
being
entitled
to
a
pre-1950
satisfaction
of
water
needs
or
beneficial
uses
before
anybody
gets
19
--
post-1950
water.
and,
so,
i
see
the
only
issue
before
us,
because
remedies
have
been
put
aside,
as
to
whether
the
beneficial
use
includes
some
percentage
increase
because
of
irrigation
demands,
but
so
what?
it
just
means
it's
going
to
limit
post-1950
users.
it's
not
going
to
limit
the
rights
of
the
pre-1950
users.
everybody's
entitled
to
change
their
irrigation
methods,
everybody's
entitled
to
change
their
crops.
they
appear
not
to
be
entitled
to
put
the
water
to
a
new
use,
whatever
--
however
that's
defined.
we
don't
need
to
get
there
today,
but
i'm
not
sure
how
you're
entitled
to
post-1950
uses
while
they're
still
not
satisfied
in
1950
use.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
question
is
what?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
--
but
your
brief,
before
we
entered
that
order,
said
the
special
master
was
right,
that
they
have
to
satisfy
their
needs
from
pre
--
post-1950
users.
why?
aren't
they
entitled
to
their
40
percent
of
how
much
excess
water
there
may
be
after
their
pre-1950
users
have
been
satisfied
in
full?
doesn't
this
compact
say
both
of
their
pre-1950
users
have
to
be
satisfied
first?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
years
has
there
been
not
enough
water
to
fill
all
pre-19
--
forget
about
whether
there
was
post-1950
use.
how
many
years
are
we
talking
about
in
which
there
has
been
not
enough
water
to
fill
everybody's?
