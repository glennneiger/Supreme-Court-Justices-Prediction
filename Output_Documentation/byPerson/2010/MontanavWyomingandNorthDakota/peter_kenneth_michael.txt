mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
identified
in
previous
questioning,
this
case
at
this
point
in
this
issue
involves
whether
a
wyoming
or
a
montana
diverter
may
change
cropping
patterns,
may
change
various
technologies
in
irrigated
agriculture,
and
change
up
and
down
depending
on
the
year
and
the
fouling
of
the
land
and
that
sort
of
thing,
the
amount
of
water
that
is
actually
consumed
by
crops;
and
i
think
the
court
has
identified
the
critical
fact
that
a
water
right,
a
classic
western
water
right,
appropriate
right
as
in
article
v(a),
is
made
up
of
the
right
to
divert
water
at
a
head
gate
in
an
irrigation
situation,
put
it
on
a
defined
quantity
of
land
and
use
it
for
a
purpose,
irrigation,
that's
defined
by
the
state.
wyoming
has
had
such
a
--
a
system
in
place
for
many
years,
and
controls
those
issues
but
does
not
and
has
not
attempted
to
measure
consumptive.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
the
standard
is
the
standard
of
waste
of
practical
irrigation.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
waste,
of
not
wasting
water
in
practical
irrigation.
the
irrigation
right
is
a
general
right,
and
if
rice
were
to
double
the
amount
of
consumptive
use
by
the
crop,
that
would
be
permissible
if
the
previous
use
had
not
been
affected
by
an
abandonment
action,
because
the
amount
of
water
was
being
reasonably
used
for
the
former
crop
and
the
crop
has
changed.
so
it's
not
a
question
of
--
of
percentage
change.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
it's
a
question--
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
--the
--
the
way
that
the
water
is
--
there's
--
there's
a
basket,
your
honor.
there's
a
basket
that
starts
with
a
quantity
that's
taken
at
the
head
gate,
4
cubic
feet
per
second
put
on
the
--
on
the
field.
and
within
that
quantity
there
--
there
is
multiple
--
two
components,
basically.
the
amount
consumed
by
the
crop
--
i
should
say
the
amount
consumed
by
the
crop
or
depleted
by
other
elements,
ditches,
seepage,
other
types
of
things,
deep
percolation
into
the
ground
--
and
--
and
the
other
component
which
is
water
that's
not
lost
but
can
return
or
go
somewhere.
it's
not
evaporated,
there's
no
--
transpiration.
so
there's
just
two
components.
and
if
that
--
if
that
quantity,
that
division
changes,
that's
perfectly
permissible
within
the
use
of
the
water
right.
and
the
reason
for
that
was
set
out
in
wiel's
--
samuel
wiel's
text
in
1911,
carried
forward
in
texts
and
cases
ever
since,
that
--
and
in
the
binning
case,
a
1940
case
in
wyoming;
which
is
the
water
while
it's
in
the
stream
in
the
public
common
is
--
is
not
under
the
possession
and
control,
the
personal
property
control
of
the
irrigator.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
your
honor,
the
definition
has
two
components,
the
classic
beneficial
--
the
component
that
would
come
from
a
classic
beneficial
use
definition,
which
is
useful
employment
for
activities
of
man,
a
beneficial
purpose,
which
--
a
nonwasteful
purpose,
that's
a
start.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
that's
--
that's
the
last
portion,
that's
the
second
part.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
the
first
part
is
use
by
which
the
water
supply
of
a
drainage
basin
is
depleted.
and
in
the
western
united
states
a
drainage
basin,
appropriated
water
is
not
all
the
water
in
the
air
and
on
the
land
and
dropping
from
the
sky;
appropriated
water
is
water
confined
in
a
water
course.
the
binning
case
made
that
clear,
until
the
water
returned
from
the
field
into
a
water
course
it
was
not
appropriable
by
the
downstream
user.
so
this
definition
--
by
using
the--
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
--i'm
addressing
the
word
supply
of
the
drainage
basin;
and
then
it
is
depleted.
use
by
which
the
supply,
the
water
supply
of
a
drainage
basin
is
depleted.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
if
you
had
a--
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
--may
i
give
an
example?
in
a
--
in
a
river,
the
tongue
river,
if
there
is
a,
if
there
is
a
water
wheel
--
montana
allows
water
rights,
1912
case,
hennessy
v.
featherman,
allows
a
water
right
to
push
a
water
wheel.
that
water
flowing
down
the
river
does
not,
does
not
--
is
not
diverted.
nevertheless
it
--
it
would
allow
a
water
right.
this
definition
differentiates
that.
in
this
definition
under
the
compact,
water
that
is
diverted
for
agriculture
that
is
diverted
is
a
beneficial
use,
but
there's
a
small
segment
of
--
of
what
could
be
a
legitimate
water
right
that
is
excluded.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
i--
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
--let
me
say
this,
your
honor,
if
i
might.
the
--
you
will
find
in
--
in
the
compact,
in
article
v(b),
the
use
of
both
diversion
and
beneficial
use.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
and
so
we
have
two
--
those
terms
are
both
used.
and
in
v(b)
the
drafters
made
a
distinction;
they
said
direct
diversions
or
storage
would
be
covered
by
v(b),
and
then
they
said
how
diversions
are
counted.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
i'm
talking
about
at
the
bottom
of
v(b)
where
you're
talking
about
the
three
--
the
third-tier
rights.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
no,
no,
5b.
in
the
first
text,
the
first
paragraph
of
5b,
towards
the
bottom,
the
text
says:
"and
the
remainder
of
the
unused
and
unappropriated
water
is
allocated
to
each
state
for
storage
and
direct
diversions
for
beneficial
use
on
new
lands.
"
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
i
think
there's
a
difference
in
that
the
--
in
practical
terms,
the
depletion
--
the
depletion
and
the
beneficial
use
definition,
a
diversion
would
be
the
only
way
to
deplete
that.
and
that's
--
that's
the
point.
the
only
way
to
make
it
through
a
depletion--
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
the
best
authority,
i
think,
is
the
special
master's
discussion
of
this,
that
the
only
practical
way
water
supply
of
the
drainage
basin
would
be
--
the
quantities
of
water
in
the
rivers
themselves
would
be
depleted
would
be
through
a
diversion.
so
there's
really
no
reason
to
make
a
distinction.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
yes,
depletion
would
be
moving
it
from
this
glass
of
water,
if
that
was
the
river,
and
it
reduces
the
quantity
of
water
in
the
river.
that
would
be
a
depletion.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
yes.
and
of
course--
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
--it
may
well
be,
your
honor.
there's
some
problems
with
this
definition.
it
self-defines
itself
using
"usefully"
twice,
so
we
have
some
drafting
issues
with
this.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
that
has
been
deferred,
is
my
understanding.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
i
disagree
--
the
language
in
article
v
that
disagrees
with
that
is
the
very
first
few
words,
"appropriative
rights".
appropriative
rights
do
not
guarantee
that
any
water
user
or
any
group
of
water
users
will
be
satisfied.
1934
was
a
horrendously
dry
year
in
the
basin,
50
percent
--
flows
were
50
percent
less
than
normal.
in
those
kinds
of
years,
the
river
--
the
river
dried
up
that
year
in
parts
of
the
river,
so--
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
--oh,
yes.
it
happened
in
2004.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
both
states,
at
times.
yes,
last
year,
all
post-1950
users
got
satisfied,
very
wide.
but
the
point
is
that
only
the
appropriative
rights,
which
is
not
a
guarantee
of
a
quantity
of
water.
so
the
first
clause
of
the
compact,
article
v(a),
does
not
establish
a
quantity
of
water,
and
there
are
many
compacts
that
do
this.
they
establish
a
quantity
of
water.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
quite
simply--
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
--yes,
and
on
an
ongoing
basis.
it's
not
a
quantity.
none
of
this
is
done
in
quantity.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
it's
all
done
in
a
system
that's
dynamic.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
no.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
yes.
yes,
before
--
when
--
on
those
particular
dates.
on
those
particular
dates,
if
there
are
pre-1950
rights
in
montana
that
are
not
satisfied
on
that
river
and
there's
post-1950
rights
in
wyoming,
the
special
master
has
ruled,
contrary
to
wyoming--
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
--60
percent.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
your
honor,
i'm
not
following,
because
there's
a
distinction
between
each
class
of
water.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
and
in
your
--
in
your
question,
i'm
not
following
which
class
you
are
referring
to.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
we
--
wyoming
is
not
entitled
on
the
same
river
to
take
post-1950
water
when
there
is
a
pre-1950
use
in
montana
that's
not
satisfied.
the
special
master
has
held
that.
pre-1950's--
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
--he
has
--
the
special
--
i'm
sorry.
the
special
master
has
recommended
that.
the
court
actually
has
granted
that.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
well,
no,
my
understanding
was
the
court
had
simply
sent
it
back
to
the
special
master
for
consideration,
that's
all.
mr.
peter
kenneth
michael
thank
you.
