mr.
steve
bullock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tongue
and
powder
rivers
are
the
only
significant
water
supply
in
a
10,000
square
mile
area
in
montana
and
wyoming,
and
this
court
is
being
asked
to
decide
whether
the
compact
allows
wyoming
to
take
the
return
flows
that
montana
farmers
in
that
area
have
always
relied
on
or,
instead,
affords
protection
to
both
states.
our
exception
should
be
sustained
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
plain
language
of
the
compact
preserves
the
water
supply
each
state
was
receiving
as
of
1950.
second,
contrary
to
the
compact's
purposes,
the
master's
interpretation
would
allow
individual
water
users
to
alter
those
amounts.
and
third,
the
master's
policy
determinations
about
efficiency
add
ambiguity
to
the
principles
underlying
a
century
of
western
water
law.
on
that--
mr.
steve
bullock
--yes,
your
honor.
in
the
compact
it's
at
the
appendix
of
the
master's
first
interim
report.
two
areas:
first,
the
preamble
provides
for
an
equitable
division/apportionment
of
the
water;
and
then
the
operative
provision,
article
v(a),
states
that
the
uses
existing
as
of
january
1st,
1950,
in
each
signatory
state
shall
continue
to
be
enjoyed.
mr.
steve
bullock
um--
mr.
steve
bullock
--your
honor,
the
whole
of
article
v(a)
and
v(b)
--
i
mean,
no
one
contests
that
it's
a
full
allocation
of
the
water.
so
v(b)
is
water
after
1950.
v(a)
is
prior.
and
in
order
for
the
status
quo
to
be
--
remain
--
for
the
appropriative
rights
to
beneficial
uses
existing
in
montana
as
of
1950,
there
needs
to
be
a
water
supply.
and
also
operative
to
that,
it's
within
the
definitions
at
article
ii(a)
to
the
beneficial
use.
and
that's
a
derivation
or
departure
from
the
general
prior
appropriation
law,
because
it's
that
use
by
which
a
water
supply
is
depleted
when--
mr.
steve
bullock
--well,
your
honor,
it
need
not
because
in
article
ii(h)
it
defines
what
a
beneficial
use
is,
and
that's
that
use
by
which
the
water
supply
of
a
basin
is
depleted.
and
it's
that
depletion
that
--
as
of
1950,
so
it
wasn't
a
full
consumption
of
water
in
wyoming,
and
that
depletion
is
the
return
flow
upon
which
montanans
rely.
mr.
steve
bullock
your
honor,
the
return
flow
is
the
basis
of
montana's
water
right,
so
that
the
return
flow
under
the
compact
isn't
actually
beneficial
use.
mr.
steve
bullock
the
equation,
your
honor,
that
consumption
is
the
same
thing
as--
mr.
steve
bullock
--as
use?
mr.
steve
bullock
well,
we
could
go
actually
to
the
special
master,
who
himself
had
stated
that
when
exploring
--
i
mean,
the
beneficial
use
reflects
the
historic
consumptive
use.
it's
from
his
own
textbook.
it's
on
page
82.
the
master
says
that
a
senior's
right
is
limited
to
the
amount
he
originally
beneficially
applied
and
consumptively
used;
that
is,
the
amount
received
at
the
point
of
use
minus
the
runoff.
mr.
steve
bullock
it's
--
it's
an
open
question,
your
honor.
yes,
they
certainly
could,
but
not
if
it
impacted
a
downstream
appropriator,
as
per
this
compact.
mr.
steve
bullock
to
the
first
question,
your
honor,
even
as
of
1950,
the
drafters
recognized
that
this
was
a
fully
appropriated
river;
it
had
reached
its
maximum
practical
limit.
so
each
individual
downstream
knows
how
much
water
they
should
be
getting.
i
mean,
we
have
80
years
of
measurements
on
one
of
these
rivers
alone,
and
you
could
go
online
right
now
and
find
out
what
the
flow
is
at
the
state
line
occurring
as
of
this
morning.
so
a
piece
of
it
that
this
is
something
we
have
been
doing
for
a
long
time
in
the
west
as
far
as
knowing
what
water
is
in
the
river,
where
it
is,
and
throughout,
you
know,
downstream
appropriation.
to
the
second
question--
mr.
steve
bullock
--and,
your
honor,
you
don't--
mr.
steve
bullock
--well,
your
honor,
it's
ultimately
up
to
each
state
to
administer
their
rights
and
their
water
intrastate.
but
this
is
a
compact
among
sovereigns.
so
what
we
need,
what
montana
needs,
is
to
get
that
supply
of
water
that
it
was
receiving
as
of
1950.
mr.
steve
bullock
your
honor,
even
at
the
time
of
the
compact,
wyoming
recognized
their
paper
rights,
that
appropriative
right,
was
much
more
than
the
actual
use
occurring.
so
you
can't
read
beneficial
use
out
of
--
especially
under
this
compact,
but
in
any.
even
under
the
general
common
law,
you
only
have
an
appropriative
right
for
the
beneficial
use,
and
all
along--
mr.
steve
bullock
--mr.
chief
justice,
two
things,
the
first
of
which,
the
beneficial
use
is
--
i
mean,
we
can't
read
this
definition
of
beneficial
use
out
of
the
contract
or
out
of
the
compact
--
and
it
is
a
contract,
actually,
among
states.
and
also,
though
--
second
of
which,
though,
that
it's
also
a
fundamental
tenet
of
prior
appropriation
law
is
the
downstream
irrigator
takes,
given
the
same
conditions
as
when
he
first
got
his
or
her
right.
mr.
steve
bullock
effectively,
your
honor,
it
could
be
yes.
mr.
steve
bullock
i
certainly
can't
answer
that,
and
they
didn't
need
to
know,
from
the
perspective--
mr.
steve
bullock
--first,
your
honor,
the
individual
landowner
does
not
have
to
put
water
back
in
that
they
didn't
even
know
what
they
were.
what
they
do
need
to
do
is
make
sure
that
the
beneficial
--
the
appropriative
rights
to
beneficial
uses
existing
in
both
states.
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
that
we
don't
break
up
v
a
a
and
v(b)
and
put
one
group
priority
over
the
other,
but
existing
as
of
1950
in
both
states
shall
continue
to
be
enjoyed.
so
the
only
way
that
we
can
continue
to
enjoy
the
rights
in
montana
downstream
is
to
ensure
that
we
have
the
water
supplies
that
we
had--
mr.
steve
bullock
--your
honor,
i
don't
say
we--
mr.
steve
bullock
--sorry?
mr.
steve
bullock
yes,
but
--
but,
your
honor,
we
don't
say
the
exact
same
quantity
of
water.
we
say
under
like
water
supplies.
mr.
steve
bullock
yes.
could
you
tell
me
the
--
i
didn't
get
the
page
of
the
special
master's
report
which
you
asserted
adopts
your
--
your
definition
of
beneficial
use.
what
page
was
it?
mr.
steve
bullock
footnote
15,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steve
bullock
and
there
he's
talking
about--
mr.
steve
bullock
--no,
your
honor,
that
would
not
be
the
case.
mr.
steve
bullock
first,
for
the
irrigators
in
montana
--
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
--
montana
sought
to
have
a
system
of
interstate
administration.
montana
--
or
wyoming,
through
storage,
through
curtailing
consumption
by
post-'50
users,
or
otherwise
can
administer
its
water
rights
in
however
it
so
deems.
so
ultimately,
that's
a
decision
of
the
state
of
how
it
administers
the
water
rights
and
the
consumption
of
that
amount
that
it
has.
for
montana,
we
can't
increase
consumption
any
more
than
the
water
that
we
would
have
received
at
that
point.
so
to
the
extent
that
montana
allows
an
individual
irrigator
to
go
to
100
percent
of
consumption
of
its
water
right,
then
in
our
system
in
montana,
we
have
to
deal
with
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
subsequent
appropriator
right
downstream.
mr.
steve
bullock
under
montana
law,
if
there's
an
injury,
and
that's
--
that's
actually
--
and
the
special
master
pointed
this
out
in
another
one
of
his
footnotes,
that
that
still
would
be
actionable.
like
a
change
from
flood
irrigation
to
sprinkler
irrigation,
to
the
extent
that
it
deprives
a
downstream
user
of
waters
that
they're
relying
on,
that
they
could
bring
an
action.
mr.
steve
bullock
both
can,
your
honor.
that
--
that
is
--
i
guess
that
presumption
is
that
we
would
have
the
water
to
use
it,
and
wyoming
is
actually
getting
a
lot
more
production
by
consuming
a
lot
more
of
the
water
within
its
right.
mr.
steve
bullock
under
like
water
supply
conditions.
mr.
steve
bullock
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
it
does
give
us
a
great
advantage,
because
we
still
have
to
deal
with
the
same
amount
of
water
supply
that
we
would
have
had.
so
at
that
point,
if
we
switch
to
sprinkler
irrigation,
the
first
irrigator
does
that,
there's
going
to
be
a
shortage
downriver
unless
we
make
it
up
through
additional
storage
or
other
causes.
so--
mr.
steve
bullock
--we
do
a
little
bit,
your
honor.
there's
the
picture
of
the
basin
in
the
first
appendix.
mr.
steve
bullock
sure.
yes,
your
honor.
in
1992
the
utah
supreme
court
framed
the
question:
this
court's
called
upon
to
determine
the
applicable
law
when
the
use
of
new
technology--
mr.
steve
bullock
--that's
--
that's
the
only
case
that
any
of
the
parties
cited
that
actually
deals
with
the
change
from
sprinkler
--
or
flood
to
sprinkler
irrigation.
and
what
that
said
is
if
the
return
flow
goes
to
the
same
river
which
it
came
from,
that
subsequent
irrigators
or
downstream
appropriators
have
the
right
to
rely
on
that.
and
i
guess
i
would
say
that
my
second
best
case
is
the
special
master's
own
footnote.
it's
6912,
where
he
says
that,
you
know,
even
though
state
change
procedures
don't
typically
apply
to
crop
or
--
changes
in
crop
irrigation
techniques,
this
does
not
mean
there's
no
way
to
challenge
increases
in
efficiency.
downstream
water
users,
for
example,
could
sue
to
enjoin
an
upstream
appropriator
from
increasing
consumption
or
to
force
the
upstream
appropriator
to
replace
lost
runoff.
mr.
steve
bullock
i
--
i
--
i
agree,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
was
trying
to
--
i
believe
justice
kennedy
asked
for
a
case
or
a
treatise,
so
that's--
mr.
steve
bullock
--but
i
agree
that
the
plain
language
--
and
especially
in
an
area
where
there's
so
much
ambiguities
the
special
master
acknowledges,
why
change
the
status
quo
of
what
was
occurring?
and
that's--
mr.
steve
bullock
--your
honor,
but
they're
depleting
more
from
the
basin,
and
that's
--
you
can
have
beneficial
use
for
non-consumptive
purposes.
mr.
steve
bullock
your
honor,
the
seepage
cases,
though,
deal
with
adjoining
landowners--
mr.
steve
bullock
--not
the
same
river
flow,
and
the
special
master
acknowledged
that.
mr.
steve
bullock
that
--
and
i
guess
what
i
was
earlier
trying
to
explain
is
certainly
each
appropriator
knows
how
much
water
it
would
--
would
be
receiving,
what
the
flows
typically
are,
and
they
all
basically
judge
on
it.
but
i
guess
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
--
and
the
law
wasn't
necessarily
clear
as
of
1950
on
conversions
from
flood
to
sprinkler
irrigation,
but
what
we
were
trying
to
do
is
preserve
those
uses
in
both
states
existing
as
of
january
1st,
1950,
and
we
can't
do
that
without
a
water
supply.
other
than
the
text,
i
think
that
the
next
place
that
one
would
look
in
interpreting
the
compact
would
be
the
legislative
history.
and
i
think
that
the
report
to
the
senate
was
real
good
in
saying
that
--
and
this
is
part
of
--
it's
appended
to
motion
--
montana's
brief
in
response
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
bill
of
complaint.
at
3a
it
says:
"it's
clear
then
that
the
demand
of
one
state
upon
another
for
a
supply
different
from
that
now
obtaining
under
present
conditions
of
supply
and
diversion
is
not
contemplated,
nor
would
such
a
demand
have
a
legal
standing.
"
so
what
they
were
trying
to
do
in
1950
was
protect
what
each
state
was
doing.
mr.
steve
bullock
that's
at
3a
of
the
appendix,
montana's
motion
--
or
the
response
to
wyoming's
motion
to
dismiss
the
bill
of
complaint.
mr.
steve
bullock
no
--
i
mean,
no,
justice
ginsburg.
wyoming
could
choose
to
reduce
groundwater
pumping.
they
could
choose
to
curtail
irrigation
on
post-1950.
they
could
choose
to
release
storage.
i
mean,
they've
--
they've
built,
i
think,
15
new
reservoirs
in
wyoming
since
the
date
of
the
compact.
they
could
choose
to
release
water
from
that
to
fulfill
those
rights.
mr.
steve
bullock
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steve
bullock
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steve
bullock
no,
your
honor,
we
can't
necessarily
satisfy
all
the
needs.
the
drafters
did
say
even
as
of
1950
that
this
basin
reached
its
maximum
practicable
limit
for
irrigation,
and
that's
from
the
october
--
the
last
of
the
drafters
meetings.
so
--
so,
the
water
supply
as
of
then,
without
additional
storage,
had
already
hit
that
limit.
and
ultimately
what
we
need,
though,
is
each
state
will
administer
intrastate,
but
we
still
should
be
able
to
rely
on
the
ability
to
get
a
supply
of
water
to
meet
those
needs
as
of
1950
under
like
water
supply
conditions.
mr.
steve
bullock
we're
still
at
the
stage
of
discovery,
but,
yes,
likely
that's
how
it
would
occur,
your
honor.
mr.
steve
bullock
it
is,
or
that
quantity
under
like
water
supply
conditions.
i
don't
think
it's
premature.
we
have
tried
to
administer
this
compact,
actually
made
calls
in
2004
and
2006;
and
as
a
result
of
not
getting
the
water,
knowing
--
believing
we're
in
a
water-short
time,
that's
when
we
filed
this
action.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
steve
bullock
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
briefly,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
this
is
a
compact,
and
it's
a
compact
between
two
different
states,
and
montana
gave
up
things,
a
right
of
priority
administration
across
state
lines
as
a
result
of
that.
justice
breyer,
as
an
issue
of
fairness,
we
don't
get
all
the
water.
we
only
get
water
supply
under
like
conditions.
we
are
now
the
downstream
appropriator,
so
--
but
one
example,
if
half
the
water
is
flowing
now
that
it
was,
as
of
1950,
montana
may
not
get
anything
at
that
point,
because
just
by
the
virtue
of
some
say
it's
"highology",
whoever
is
higher
on
the
river
gets
to
take
first.
so
we
--
we
don't
get
to
fulfill
our
rights.
all
we
get
is
to
ensure
that
given
a
like
supply
of
water,
that
our
rights
shall
continue
to
be
enjoyed
as
it
existed
as
of
1950.
mr.
steve
bullock
and
--
your
honor,
we
have
done
no
discovery
at
all.
this
is
still
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
that's
what
the
hydraulics
and
the
engineers
will
ultimately
determine.
we
made
calls
in
2004
and
2006.
we
said,
wait
a
minute,
we're
not
getting
enough
water
here,
and
we
believe
it's
the
--
the
pre-1950
uses
that
are
depleting
that.
will
you
give
us
water?
ultimately
why
we're
here
is
to
sort
this
out.
i
guess,
i
would
also
point
out
that
there
was
some
discussion
about
an
appropriative
right
is
the
right
to
use
a
quantity
of
water.
that
makes
sense
other
than
if
you're
in
a
compact,
and
montana
gets
no
water.
the
solicitor
general
even
pointed
out
then
in
his
brief
at
a
footnote;
he
said
well,
what
we
might
do,
then,
is
that
montana
could
bring
an
equitable
apportionment
action
for
the
pre-1950
water.
that
highlights
the,
i
think
to
me,
the
illogic
of
just
focusing
on
the
rights
and
not
looking
at
the
uses
and
how
much
each
state
was
consuming,
because
at
that
point
i'll
be
right
back
here
saying
we
want
the
same
water
under
like
conditions
that
we
had
in
1950.
thank
you,
your
honor.
