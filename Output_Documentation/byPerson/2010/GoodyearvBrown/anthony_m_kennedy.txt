again,
this
is
preliminary
and
it
just
goes
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
suppose
you
could
help
me
out.
i
assume
that
there
is
general
jurisdiction
over
the
parent
company.
then
under
respondeat
superior,
it
would
be
liable
in
north
carolina
for
the
--
all
the
acts
of
its
agents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
why
isn't
it
automatically
liable
for
all
the
acts
of
its
subsidiaries?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
does
that
get
--
and
does
that
get
into
what
in
the
federal
practice
would
be
necessary
parties?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
--
i
was
wondering
why
--
why
is
your
interest
in
this
case
so
much
greater
than
it
would
be
in
--
in
the
other
case,
and
this
--
i've
been
wondering
that
at
the
outset,
and
this
sentence
that
justice
kagan
points
out
brings
that
into
full
focus.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
you
don't
defend
the
reasoning
of
the
state
supreme
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
an
--
that's
an
odd
way
to
think
about
general
jurisdiction.
general
jurisdiction
is
principally
status.
your
residence,
the
principal
place
of
business,
the
place
of
incorporation.
and
these
factors
that
you're
mentioning,
they're
--
in
fact,
some
of
the
factors
you
mention
in
the
brief
are
quite
different
than
that.
