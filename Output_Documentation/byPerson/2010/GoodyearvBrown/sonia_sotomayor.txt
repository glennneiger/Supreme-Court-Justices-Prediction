let's
assume
that
you're
right,
that
on
some
level
that
some
--
that
it's
not
just
the
place
of
incorporation
or
the
principal
place
of
business,
that
it
could
be
created
by
something
more.
the
only
something
more
here
is
goodyear
usa,
so
your
adversary
is
right
that
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
sort
of
a
reverse
principal-agent.
you're
saying
that
the
subsidiary
has
used
the
principal,
its
owner,
as
its
agent.
that's
really
--
that's
the
core
problem
with
your
argument,
isn't
it?
because
without
the
goodyear
usa
activities,
there's
no
other
activity
by
the
foreign
corporations.
justice

does
good
--
do
any
of
these
companies,
the
goodyear
turkey
company,
the
others,
do
any
of
them
sell
the
tires
directly
to
goodyear
usa
for
distribution
to
the
united
states?
as
i
understand
it,
these
tires
were
sold
to
other
entities,
foreign
entities,
who
then
sold
them
to
the
u.s.?

i'm
not
sure
that
that
answered
--
i
understood
you
to
be
saying
that
substantively,
they
might
not
be
liable
for
the
defect
that
caused
the
accident.
is
that
it?
