mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
north
carolina
state
court
was
wrong
to
assert
general
personal
jurisdiction
over
petitioners,
extending
potentially
to
any
claim
against
them
arising
out
of
any
conduct
of
theirs
anywhere
in
the
world,
and
there
are
several
ways
to
see
why
that's
wrong.
even
if
the
court
were
to
accept
the
proposition
that
such
contacts
with
north
carolina
as
there
are
in
the
record
should
be
attributed
to
petitioners,
those
contacts
still
don't
rise
to
the
level
of
what
this
court
has
--
has
demanded
in
terms
of
continuous
and
systematic
contacts.
and
even
setting
those
more
--
those
more
precedential
tests
aside,
i
think
there's
also
a
--
the
result
of
the
north
carolina
court's
decision
is
that
the
jurisdictional
consequences
here
would
be
quite
disproportionate
to
the
contacts
that
--
that
--
on
which
it
would
be
based.
so
if
i
can,
i
guess,
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
continuous
and
systematic
contacts
proposition,
which
this
court
has
certainly
not
elaborated
in
its
case
law,
but
i
think
it
--
it
would
be
--
i
think
it's
useful
to
speak
of,
of
what
exactly
the
court
was
trying
to
get
at.
what
we
think
the
court
was
trying
to
get
at,
particularly
by,
as
my
friend
referred
to,
particularly
by
its
reference
in
helicopteros
to
perkins
as
--
as
being
sort
of
a
benchmark
for
what
continuous
and
systematic
contacts
are,
i
think
it
requires
seeing
an
active
volitional
undertaking
by
the
--
by
the
defendant.
it
can't
be
based
on
the
contact
--
conduct
of
third
parties.
obviously
the
continuous
concept
of
existing
without
interruption.
and
with
respect
to
systematic,
we
think
that
that
means
there
needs
to
be
a
plurality
of
contacts,
they
have
to
be
of
--
of
different
kinds
or
qualities
in
a
sense
of
perhaps
employment,
as
well
as
contractual,
as
well
as
regulatory,
as
well
as
property,
as
well
as
sales
or
purchases,
and
that
those
contacts
together
have
to
have
some
interrelationship
that
results
in
something
that
might
be
thought
of
as
more
than
the
sum
of
their
parts.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
as
--
as
mr.
feder
referred
--
referred
to,
there
--
there
is
a
division
in
the
lower
courts
on
whether
that
sort
of
a
consent
is
effective
to
permit
the
state
general
jurisdiction
over
--
over
the
consenting
party.
that
--
but
the
court
has,
i
--
i
think,
been
--
been
fairly
clear
in
--
in
--
in
setting
notions
of
--
of
formal
consent
to
one
side
when
considering
contacts-based
cases.
and,
so,
in
part,
this
case,
therefore,
doesn't
present
that
question
and
we
don't
have
a
position,
as
the
government,
on
that
today,
with
respect
to
whether
that's
effective.
but
it
certainly
is
the
case
that
simply
because
one
entity
in
a
goodyear
family
of
--
of
related
corporations
has
consented,
that
somehow
that
consent
should
extend
to
the
entire
enterprise.
and
if
i
can,
maybe,
take
a
minute
to
talk
about
where
we
think
the
respondents'
view
of
--
of
this
enterprise
jurisdiction
goes
wrong,
because
we
touched
on
it
only
--
only
briefly
in
our
brief,
which
was,
of
course,
filed
before
theirs.
when
--
when
a
court
confronts
a
--
a
set
of
--
a
corporate
family,
if
you
will,
there
seem
to
be
two
principles
that
can
be
usefully
applied
in
determining
the
jurisdictional
consequences
of
that
relationship.
one
is
the
alter
ego
concept,
which
certainly
doesn't
seem
to
be
supported
on
anything
in
the
record
here
in
the
sense
that
there's
--
that
there's
no
sound
suggestion
in
the
record
that
--
that
the
european
entities
were
somehow
a
sham,
that
they
didn't
have
any
separate
existence,
they
were
undercapitalized
or
any
of
the
other
indicia
that
you
would
see.
and,
so,
to
your
point,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
is
certainly
something
the
court
could
say
that
the
record
here
is
no
basis
for
that
kind
of
a
decision
to
disregard
the
corporate
separateness.
then
the
other
concept
is
the
agency
concept.
and
i
think
that
may
be
what
--
what
respondents
are
placing
somewhat
greater
reliance
on.
and
we
certainly
--
we
certainly
have
the
view
that
an
agent,
acting
on
behalf
of
a
principal
within
the
scope
of
its
agency,
can
take
actions
that
create
contacts
with
the
jurisdiction
that
are,
by
virtue
of
the
agency
relationship,
attributable
back
to
the
principal.
but
there
are
--
there
are
two
important
things
to
realize,
that
that
--
that
that
proposition
is
somewhat
modest
in
that,
first
of
all,
simply
because
a
--
a
parent
owns
a
subsidiary
does
not
mean
the
subsidiary
is
the
parent's
agent.
plenty
of
parents
simply
own
subsidiaries
as
property
or
for
various
business
reasons.
it
doesn't
mean
the
subsidiary
is
automatically
always
acting
as
the
agent
of
the
parent
for
all
purposes
or
any
at
all.
and
--
and
the
second
thing
to
be
cautious
about
in
applying
the
agency
principle
is
that
the
agency
relationship
only
runs
one
way.
that
is
to
say,
the
agent
can
do
something
that
creates
a
contact
on
behalf
of
the
principal,
but
that's
not
to
say
that
everything
the
principal
does
in
its
independent
activities
says
anything
about
what
contacts
its
agent
has.
that's
exactly
backwards.
in
the
--
and,
so,
here
the
--
the
allegation
actually
in
the
complaint
is
that
the
european
companies
are
the
agents
of
the
parent
--
of
the
--
of
the
goodyear
u.s.
entity,
that's
--
that's
paragraph
16
of
the
complaint
at
page
112
of
--
122
of
the
joint
appendix.
so
it
--
it
might
be
--
it
--
it
--
there
might
be
an
argument
that
something
that
the
european
subsidiaries
have
done,
say,
in
turkey
is
something
that
could
be
chargeable
to
the
u.s.
parent
in
a
case
where
it
was
relevant
what
the
parent's
relationship
with
turkey
was.
but
what
respondents
are
asking
for
here,
in
effect,
turns
that
completely
around
and
suggests
implicitly
that
the
--
the
--
this
--
the
parent
of
the
goodyear
organization
in
the
united
states
was
somehow
doing
the
bidding,
acting
at
the
direction
and
control
of
the
european
companies
as
principals.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
so,
in
the
sense
that
i
--
i
think
we
were
sort
of
assuming
arguendo
a
concept
of
purposeful
availment
that
--
that
would
be
willing
to
attribute
those
--
those
contacts
for
purposes
of
a
specific
jurisdiction
--
excuse
me
--
for
purposes
of
a
specific
jurisdiction
analysis.
i
don't
know
if
that
helps
with
the
--
with
the
answer,
but--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
justice
kennedy,
let
me
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
it
--
it
--
the
difference
in
our
interest
in
the
two
cases
is
at
bottom
just
a
difference
in
magnitude,
but
we
think
it's
a
fairly
significant
difference
in
magnitude
in
the
sense
--
in
the
sense
that
the
jurisdictional
consequences
of
an
assertion
of
general
jurisdiction
are
that
--
with
that
one
determination
it
is
the
case
that
that
defendant
can
potentially
be
brought
to
judgment
in
a
forum
for
all
--
for
claims
arising
from
any
of
its
conduct
anywhere
in
the
world.
and
specific
jurisdiction
by
construction,
by
its
very
nature,
is
only
going
to
be
a
determination
--
whatever
the
contours
of
the
specific
rules
that
are
used,
it's
going
to
never
be
more
than
the
determination
that
jurisdiction
in
a
claim,
considering
the
relationship
between
the
defendant,
the
forum,
and
the
particular
litigation
gives
rise
to
jurisdiction.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
[laughter]
the
--
the
--
the
brief
answer
is
that
the
internet
questions,
in
particular,
are
so
complicated
and
indeed
so
potentially
far-reaching
that
in
a
case
that
presented
them
our
interest
might
very
well
be
different.
