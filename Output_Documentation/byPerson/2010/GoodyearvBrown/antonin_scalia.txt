we
haven't
resolved
a
whole
lot
if
we
leave
that
question
open,
have
we?
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
that
says:
unless
you
--
unless
you
ignore
the
separate
corporate
existence
of
the
subsidiary
--
parenthesis,
a
question
on
which
we
expressed
no
opinion,
close
parenthesis
--
there
can
be
no
jurisdiction
in
cases
like
this?
is
that
the
kind
of
an
opinion
that
the
world
is
waiting
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
saying
we
should
not
even
--
not
even
--
not
even
address
the
situation
where
there
is
no
special
basis
for
ignoring
the
separate
incorporation.
i
--
of
course,
we
should
not
get
into
questions
of
whether,
in
fact,
the
subsidiary
was
a
sham,
that
there
was
control,
all
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
simple
question
of
whether
when
you
have
a
totally
owned
subsidiary,
its
actions
are
your
actions.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
we
have
to
reach
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you've
got
--
you
have
me
in
suspense.
tell
me
why
it
is
that
the
general
principles
of
jurisdiction
do
apply
here,
and
then
we
can
get
to
waiver.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
leave
me
dangling
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
case-specific
is
not
talking
about
general
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
talking
about
specific
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
just
give
me
a
list
of
--
of
what
--
what
factors
you
think
support
general
jurisdiction
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
one,
two,
three,
four,
which
ones
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
question
isn't
whether
they
did
that;
the
question
is
whether
it
was
right
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
don't
make
your
point
by
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
those
arrangements
could
exist
with
a
lot
of
distributors.
you
don't
want
to
ship
a
distributor
stuff
that
the
distributor
is
not
going
to
be
using.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
my
goodness.
the
fact
that
you
coordinate
with
your
distributor
how
much
of
your
product
you
are
going
to
ship
to
him
doesn't
--
doesn't
really
show--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
you
are
a
unitary
business
with
your
distributor.

page

of
the
brief?
i
didn't
read
that
many
pages.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
they
rather
be
sued
in
china?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't.
i
don't
know
anybody
who
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
not
unfairness
and
undue
burden.
it's
a
matter
of
what
--
what
power
a
sovereign
has.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
could
be
perfectly
fair
if
you
announce
that
you're
going
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
anybody
who
harms
an
american
citizen
anywhere
in
the
world,
and
you
give
notice
to
every
manufacturer
in
the
world,
that
would
be
perfectly
fair.
but
you
have
no
power
to
do
that
under
--
under
accepted
notions
of
what
a
sovereign
can
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
you
believe
that
burden
is
the
only
issue.
the
issue
is
power,
not
just
burden.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
special
jurisdiction?
why
don't
--
why
we
decide
this
on
the
basis
of
special
jurisdiction?
it's
an
accepted
basis
of
jurisdiction.
citizenship
is.
countries
can
make
it
a
crime
--
in
fact
i
think
italy
does,
to
kill
an
italian
citizen
abroad,
and
that
person
can
be
tried
for
that
crime
in
italy.
so
i
assume
that
--
that
that
is
an
acceptable
basis
of
jurisdiction.
so
why
don't
we
say
that
there's
a
specialized
jurisdiction
when
a
citizen
of
--
of
north
carolina
is
--
is
injured
abroad,
so
long
as
there
is,
what
--
what
is
the
word?
the
submission
to
the
--
to
the
courts
of
north
carolina
by
having
enough
contacts
with
north
carolina.
the
previous
case,
what's
that
crazy
word?
justice
antonin
scalia
availment.
i
meant
to
look
that
up.
i'm
not
sure
--
i'm
not
sure
it's
ever
been
used
except
in
this
courtroom.
[laughter]
why
--
why
don't
we
decide
it
that
way?
