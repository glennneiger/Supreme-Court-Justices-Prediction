justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
piece
of
this
i
don't
quite
comprehend.
you
--
there's
no
contest
that
there
is
jurisdiction
over
the
parent,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
--
it's
based
on
consent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
met
with
an
argument
that
it's
all
one
ball
of
wax,
parent
and
sub,
they
merge,
it's
one
enterprise;
and
so
if
the
subs
do
something
anyplace,
the
parent
is
--
it's
all
part
of
one
thing,
so
i
think
that
was
the
principal
argument
made
by
respondents.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
perkins
is
kind
of
an
unusual
case,
because
it
was
a
company
that
at
the
time
was
doing
business
only
in
ohio.
it
was
a
philippine
mining
company
and
it
was
world
war
ii,
so
the
mines
couldn't
be
run.
so
to
the
extent
that
the
corporation
was
existing
anywhere,
it
was
in
ohio.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
suppose
it's
just
a
corporation
that's
registered
to
do
business
in
north
carolina,
and
the
connection
with
that
registration;
it
says:
i
appoint
so-and-so
my
agent
to
receive
process
for
any
and
all
claims?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
there's
something
very
new
about
this,
because
general
jurisdiction
is
all-purpose
jurisdiction
and
for
a
corporation
it's
sort
of
like
a
residence
for
an
individual.
i
think
mr.
feder
was
making
that
point.
what's
--
what's
troubling
here
is
that
the
north
carolina
court
seems
to
be
blending
the
two
together,
specific
jurisdiction
based
on
the
claim
arising
in
the
forum,
and
general
jurisdiction
with
a
claim
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
forum,
and
it's
insertion
of
jurisdiction
over
any
and
all
claims.
and
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
post-international
shoe.
the
only
thing
that
we
have
is
perkins
v.
benguet.
is
there
--
is
there
any
case
in
which
this
court
has
sanctioned
the
assertion
of
general
jurisdiction
based
on
some
prior
--
some
product
coming
into
the
state,
not
the
product
that
caused
the
injury
abroad?
i
don't
know
any
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
don't
have
anything
in
the
record
about
this
being
a
unitary
business.
unless
you're
trying
to
present
some
sweeping,
piercing
the
corporate
veil
theory,
there
is
nothing
here
that
says
that
these
are
--
corporations
are
not
acting
separately,
that
have
their
own
officers,
have
their
own
employees,
keep
their
own
books.
there's
nothing
to
show
that
it's
all
part
of
one--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
"it"
wasn't
the
product
that
caused
the
injury
here.
as
i
understand
the
case
the
tire
that
allegedly
caused
this
bus
to
turn
over
was
designed
for
the
european
and
asian
market,
not
the
u.s.
market.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
did
--
why
should
--
mr.
feder
brought
up
the
helicopteros
and
he
said
in
that
case
it
was
purchase;
and
in
this
case
it's
sales,
and
in
the
purchaser
case
certainly
we
said
no,
there's
no
general
jurisdiction.
why
should
it
be
any
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
perkins
it
was
the
home
of
the
corporation.
there
was
no
other
at
the
time,
because
their
permanent
home
was
not
functioning
because
of
the
war.
so
there
was
only
one
place.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
was
the
president
of
the
corporation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
whatever
business
it
was
doing,
it
was
doing
from
that
office
in
ohio.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
about
the
ramifications
of
your
theory
of
this
general
jurisdiction
in
north
carolina
over
these
three
subsidiaries?
suppose
that
one
of
the
children
on
the
bus
was
a
canadian
citizen,
was
going
home
to
canada,
and
had
the
idea
that
juries
in
north
carolina
are
more
liberal
than
in
france
--
well,
there
wouldn't
be
any
jury
in
france.
so
could
the
canadian
come
and
sue
because
there's
general
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
we're
talking
about
goodyear
and
these
three
subsidiaries.
you
say
there's
general
jurisdiction
in
north
carolina.
those
companies
can
be
sued
on
any
and
all
claims.
so
my
question
is:
could
anyone
on
that
bus
that
turned
over
in
paris
come
to
north
carolina
to
bring
the
wrongful
death
or
whatever
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
any
case
law
that
supports
your
position,
which,
i
take
it
--
and
correct
me
if
i've
got
it
wrong
--
that
a
subsidiary
is
subject
to
jurisdiction
wherever
the
parent
is,
so
long
as
some
products
made
by
the
subsidiary
are
shipped
by
the
parent
to
the
--
to
buyers
in
the
foreign
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
see
nothing
in
the
north
carolina
court's
opinion
that
explains
that
this
is
the
--
this
is
a
corporation
where
we
can
obliterate
the
distinction
between
parent
and
sub.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
--
there's
a
--
you
open
your
brief
saying
something
to
the
effect
that
this
case
is
about
outsourcing.
jobs
in
the
u.s.
going
to
some
subsidiary
port.
but
then
these
subsidiaries
are
making
tires,
which
on
your
own
admission,
very
rarely
come
to
the
united
states
because
they're
designed
specifically
for
vehicles
in
asia
and
in
europe,
and
so
i
would
think
that
turkey
would
be
the
ideal
location
for
--
for
such
a
place.
i
don't
get
your
outsourcing
pitch.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
go
back?
and
you
--
you
said
something
about
the
two
of
them
are
subject
to
suit,
you
said
this
is
a
question
of
one
lawsuit
instead
of
four.
could
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
france?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
a
question
of
more
convenience.
it's
a
question
that
the
claim
arose
there,
and
then,
of
course,
just
because
the
claim
arose
there,
there
would
be
some
convenience
factors.
all
the
witnesses
to
the
accident
are
there,
whatever
is
left
of
the
bus
is
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
a
country
that
has
this
--
what
justice
scalia
--
france
in
the
civil
code
says
that
any
french
citizen
can
sue
anybody
on
any
claim
in
france.
but
we
consider
that
an
exorbitant
jurisdictional
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
authority
of
a
u.s.
court
to
hear
a
case
against
a
foreign
defendant
based
on
an
incident
that
occurred
abroad.
the
suit
arose
from
a
tragic
accident,
two
13-year
old
boys
from
north
carolina
were
on
a
soccer
adventure
in
france.
a
bus
taking
them
to
the
airport
for
their
journey
home
overturned
outside
paris.
both
boys
sustained
fatal
injuries.
attributing
the
accident
to
a
goodyear
tire
that
failed,
the
boy's
parents
commenced
wrongful-death
suits
in
a
north
carolina
state
court.
named
as
--
as
defendants
were
goodyear
usa
and
three
foreign
subsidiaries
of
that
parent
corporation,
goodyear
luxembourg,
goodyear
france,
and
goodyear
turkey.
the
tire
alleged
to
have
caused
the
accident
was
made
in
istanbul
by
goodyear
turkey.
all
three
subsidiaries
made
tires
designed
for
markets
in
europe
and
asian
countries.
their
tire's
differed
in
size
and
construction
from
tires
ordinarily
used
in
the
united
states.
goodyear
usa,
an
ohio
corporation
that
had
plants
in
north
carolina
and
regularly
engaged
in
commercial
activity
there,
did
not
object
to
suit
in
that
state.
the
three
european
subsidiaries
however,
did
object
asserting
their
lack
of
connection
to
north
carolina.
the
tires
they
made,
they
stressed,
were
geared
to
european
and
asian
road
conditions,
and
was
seldom
sold
to
us
buyers.
because
the
accident
occurred
in
france,
and
because
the
subsidiaries
have
no
regular,
and
sustained
north
carolina
contacts,
they
urged
that
their
subjection
to
the
jurisdiction
of
north
carolina's
courts
would
be
incompatible
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
our
pathmarking
decision
on
questions
of
personal
jurisdiction
over
nonresidents,
compatible
with
due
process,
is
a
1945
opinion,
international
shoe
company
against
washington.
international
shoes
sparked
recognition
of
a
distinction
between
general
or
all-purpose
jurisdiction
over
a
defendant,
and
specific
case-linked
jurisdictions.
a
state
court
may
assert
general
jurisdiction
over
a
foreign
corporation
to
hear
any
and
all
claims
against
the
corporation
if
this
condition
is
met.
the
foreign
corporation's
affiliations
with
the
state
are
so
"continuous
and
systematic"
as
to
render
the
corporation,
not
a
stranger,
but
at
home
in
the
state.
specific
jurisdiction
in
contrast,
depends
on
an
"affiliation
between
the
forum
and
the
underlying
controversy,"
principally,
an
activity
or
occurrence
that
takes
place
in
the
forum
state.
a
classic
example,
a
nonresident
drives
her
car
into
another
state,
and
negligently
causes
an
accident
there.
she
may
never
have
entered
the
state
before,
yet
she
will
be
answerable
there
to
persons
injured
in
the
accident.
unlike
general
all-purpose
jurisdiction,
specific
jurisdiction
is
confined
to
adjudication
of
the
very
controversy
that
establishes
jurisdiction.
because
the
bus
accident
that
prompted
the
litigation
occurred
in
france,
and
the
tire
that
failed
was
made
and
sold
abroad,
north
carolina
plainly
lacked
specific
jurisdiction
over
the
three
european
corporations.
the
question
for
our
decision
is
whether
the
foreign
corporations
are
amenable
to
suit
in
north
carolina
on
a
claim
unrelated
to
any
north
carolina
activity
of
those
corporations.
confusing
or
blending
general
and
specific
jurisdiction
inquiries,
the
north
carolina
courts
answered
yes,
the
european
manufacturers
maybe
sued
in
north
carolina
because
a
small
percentage
of
the
tires
they
made
were
sold
to
north
carolina
purchases.
we
reverse
that
determination,
the
connections
between
the
foreign
corporations
and
north
carolina
were
hardly
"continuous
and
systematic,"
they
fall
far
short
of
the
strong
ties
necessary
to
render
north
carolina
a
place
where
the
goodyear
subsidiaries
are
at
home.
in
the
merits
briefly
filed
in
this
court,
the
plaintiffs
urged
--
urges
to
disregard
the
separate
corporate
organization
and
operations
of
goodyear
usa,
and
its
foreign
subsidiaries.
in
other
words,
they
asked
us
to
pierce
the
corporate
veils
and
treat
all
four
defendants
as
a
--
not
as
discreet
entities,
but
as
a
"unitary
business,"
so
that
jurisdiction
over
the
parent,
goodyear
usa,
would
draw
in
the
subsidiaries
as
well.
plaintiffs
failed
to
raise
that
argument
in
the
courts
below
or
in
their
brief
in
opposite
into
certiorari.
they
have
therefore
forfeited
the
argument,
so
we
express
no
view
on
it.
the
court's
opinion
is
unanimous.
