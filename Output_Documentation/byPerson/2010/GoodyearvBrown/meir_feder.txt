mr.
meir
feder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
asserted
jurisdiction
over
petitioners
in
this
case
on
claims
that
arose
from
a
bus
accident
in
france
that
was
unrelated
to
any
north
carolina
contact.
although
the
petitioners
are
located
overseas
and
do
not
conduct
any
business
in
north
carolina,
the
court
held
that
north
carolina
had
general
jurisdiction
over
these
defendants
based
solely
on
the
sale
in
north
carolina
of
a
small
fraction
of
their
products.
under
this
court's
cases,
the
mere
sale
of
a
defendant's
products
in
a
state
does
not
permit
the
state
to
reach
out
to
assert
judicial
power
over
all
of
that
defendant's
worldwide
conduct.
if
that
were
permissible,
every
significant
seller
of
products
would
be
subject
to
suit
everywhere
on
any
claim
arising
anywhere.
mr.
meir
feder
yes,
your
honor.
the
parent
company
consented
to
jurisdiction
in
north
carolina.
it's
appointed
an
agent
for
service
of
process
there.
mr.
meir
feder
yes.
they
also
have
other
business
that
the
parent
does
conduct
in
north
carolina,
but
there's
no
objection
to
jurisdiction
over
the
parent
here.
this
case
solely
concerns
the
petitioners,
who
are
corporations
from
turkey,
france
and
luxembourg.
mr.
meir
feder
i
think
that
that
is
a
hard
question.
your
honor,
the
short
answer
is
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
but
i
think
that
that
is
probably
a
close
case,
again
putting
aside
the
consent.
but
i
do
think
that
general
jurisdiction
is
about
suing
a
company
--
at
least
in
the
case
of
corporations,
is
about
suing
the
corporation
essentially
where
it's
located
or
at
home.
it's
always
fair
to
bring
a
suit
against
the
corporation
there.
i
think
that
once
you
get
beyond
that,
which
is
a
situation
that
would
be
analogous
to
a
state's
power
over
a
citizen
or
a
resident
of
the
state,
i
think
you
run
into
great
difficulty
finding
a
basis
for
the
state
to
assert
authority
over
claims
completely
unrelated
to
any
business
that
--
or
any
contacts
that
the
corporation
has
with
the
state.
that
said,
it
wasn't
contested
here,
and
there
is
a
consent
to
service
of
process,
which
may
or
may
not
create
general
jurisdiction.
there's
a
disagreement
in
the
lower
courts
on
that,
but
none
of
that
is
contested
in
this
case.
and
without
having
to
get
to
that
particular
question
of
whether
in
fact
it's
limited
to
--
whether
general
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
place
of
incorporation
or
principal
place
of
business,
first
of
all,
there's
much
more
directly
controlling
authority.
in
this
case,
the
most
directly
relevant
cases
are
helicopteros
and
consolidated
textile
v.
gregory,
working
in
tandem.
in
helicopteros,
which
was
this
court's
last
corporate
general
jurisdiction
case,
the
court
said
that
there
was
no
general
jurisdiction
based
on
$4
million
in
purchases
in
the
state
and
some
other
contacts;
and
the
key
is
that
--
on
that
point,
is
that
the
court
held
that
mere
purchases
could
not
provide
the
basis
for
general
jurisdiction
because
the
pre-international
shoe
decision
in
rosenberg
was
controlling
on
that
point.
mr.
meir
feder
i
think
that's
a
fair
assumption.
mr.
meir
feder
well,
because
i
think--
mr.
meir
feder
--what
--
your
honor,
i
think
that
really
what
it
gets
into
is
the
difference
between
a
subsidiary
and
an
agent,
because
a
subsidiary
is
not
automatically
acting
as
the
agent
of
the
parent
company
in
a
way
where
you
would
get
respondeat
superior.
and
i
think
that
part
of
what
is
going
on
in
this
case
is
that
when
this
does
go
back
to
north
carolina
for
trial
or
for
litigation
against
the
parent
company,
i
think
that
under
north
carolina
or
whatever
state's
or
nation's
vail
piercing
or
agency
standards
the
north
carolina
courts
will
apply,
the
plaintiffs
will
have
great
difficulty
actually
with
the
substantive
case
against
the
parent
company,
because
you
would
actually
have
to
show
involvement
in
the
actions
that
actually
the
claim
arose
out
of
here.
the
mere
general
control
that's
inherent
in
the
parent/subsidiary
relationship
is
not
going
to
create
liability,
and
here
--
important
to
remember
--
we're
talking
about
a
tire
manufactured
in
turkey,
accident
in
france,
which
goodyear
tire
and
rubber
company
--
and
now
this
is
outside
the
record,
as
i
understand
it
--
did
not
have
any
direct
connection
with.
again
not
relevant
to
the
jurisdictional
question
here,
but
i
--
just
for
sort
of
setting
the
context.
mr.
meir
feder
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
would
say,
again
when
it
comes
to
liability
and
goodyear
tire
and
rubber,
they
will
be
free
to
make
that
argument.
that
argument
is
not
properly
presented
here.
it
was
never
made
below.
it
was
never
--
it
was
not
made
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
cert,
so
any
argument
for
ignoring
corporate
distinctions
or
an
enterprise
theory,
none
of
that
was
made,
and
therefore
has
been
waived.
i
think
that,
secondly,
as
we
indicated
in
our
reply
brief--
mr.
meir
feder
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
actually
in
--
if
the
court
were
to
write
that,
it
would
be
left
with
the
important
general
jurisdiction
question
that
the
court
below
decided
incorrectly,
and
incorrectly
in
a
few
ways.
i
think
that,
in
fact,
there
would
be
several
ways
for
this
court
to
approach
it,
all
of
which
would
actually
help
to
clear
up
the
law
in
this
area.
i
think
that
even
if
one
gets
past
the
waiver
point
--
and
the
reason
the
court
shouldn't
get
past
the
waiver
point
is,
among
other
things,
because
it
wasn't
raised
--
we,
of
course,
had
no
opportunity
to
put
in
evidence
that,
in
fact,
these
corporations
are
run
separately,
independent
decisionmaking,
observation
of
corporate
form,
and
all
the
other
things
that
would
normally
go
into
it.
if
you
want
to
reach
it,
first
of
all,
there
is
--
even
on
the
standards
articulated
in
the
respondent's
brief,
there
is
nothing
in
the
records
that
supports
it.
mr.
meir
feder
oh.
mr.
meir
feder
that,
i
think,
the
court--
mr.
meir
feder
--you
certainly
do
have
to
reach
that,
your
honor.
the
court
has
reached
it
and
decided
it
before,
and
has
said
that
the
mere
parent-subsidiary
relationship
does
not
create
attribution
one
to
the
other,
most
recently
in
keeton,
in
which
the
court
cited
some
of
its
older
cases
for
that
very
proposition.
and
i
think
that
in
--
another
way
to
look
at
it
is,
even
if
you
wanted
to
treat
the
sales
in
north
carolina
as
if
they
were
made
there
directly
by
these
petitioners
--
in
other
words,
even
if
you
picked
--
assuming
arguendo
that
you
could
attribute
those
sales
directly
to
the
petitioners
and
not,
as
the
court
below
found,
treat
them
as
not
having
been
caused
by
them,
that
does
not
come
close
to
satisfying
what
is
required
for
general
jurisdiction.
and
in
particular,
in
going
back
to
helicopteros
and
gregory,
just
as
the
rosenberg
case
was
binding
in
helicopteros
on
the
point
that
mere
purchases
are
not
enough
for
general
jurisdiction,
here
consolidated
textile
v.
gregory
is
binding
on
the
flip
side
of
that,
which
is
that
mere
sales
in
the
state
are
not
enough
for
general
jurisdiction.
even
if
gregory
weren't
binding,
i
think
that
you
could
look
at
helicopteros
and
say
there
is
no
real
basis
for
a
distinction
between
mere
purchases
and
mere
sales.
but
in
fact,
there
is
a
case
directly
on
point,
and
as
well
as
a
lot
of
case
law
from
the
time
of
gregory
more
generally
requiring
much
more
substantial
--
substantial
physical
presence
in
the
state.
in
terms
of
--
i
think
no
personal
jurisdiction
argument
should
go
by
without
talking
about
international
shoe,
and
if
you
look
at
just
the
international
shoe
line
of
cases,
even
aside
from
this
issue
of
gregory
being
binding,
the
decision
below
is
equally,
if
not
more,
untenable.
international
shoe
itself
recognizes
--
in
sort
of
carving
out
an
area
for
what
eventually
came
to
be
called
general
jurisdiction,
it
recognizes
the
extraordinary
nature
of
the
state
power
that
we're
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
general
jurisdiction,
which
is
this
power
to
reach
out
and
assert
state
power
over
things
that
by
hypothesis
have
no
relationship
to
contacts
with
the
state.
international
shoe
uses
the
language
saying
that
you
need
continuous
corporate
operations
within
the
state
and
says
that
these
continuous
corporate
operations
have
to
be
so
substantial
and
of
such
a
nature
as
to
justify
this
jurisdiction
over
conduct
that
is
entirely
unconnected
to
the
state.
the
one
case
where
the
court
has
upheld
general
jurisdiction
since
international
shoe
over
a
corporation
is
perkins,
which
was
a
case
that
involved
the
corporation's
principal
place
of
business,
and
in
helicopteros,
following
perkins,
when
the
court
articulated
the
standard
there,
the
court
said
that
we're
looking
to
see
whether
there
are
contacts
of
the
sort
that
we
found
to
exist
in
perkins.
so--
mr.
meir
feder
--that's
right,
your
honor,
and
i
guess
what
i
would
say
about
that
is
that
it's
unusual.
those
are
unusual
facts,
but
not
unusual
in
terms
of
what
is
required
to
be
able
to
assert
general
jurisdiction.
the
court
in
keeton
later
described
perkins
as
essentially
involving
the
corporation's
principal
place
of
business,
and
i
think
that's
right
because
in
order
for
the
state
to
be
able
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
things
unrelated
to
the
state,
you
need
that
type
of
relationship
equivalent
to
a
citizen
or
resident
that
gives
a
state
authority
over
the
corporation's
actions
worldwide
and
not
just
--
because
this
goes
far
beyond
specific
jurisdiction
where
the
state
has
a
manifest
interest
in
an
accident
or
a
claim
that
arose
in
the
state
or
connected
to
the
state.
helicopteros,
just
to
circle
back
on
that
point,
does
say,
we're
looking
for
contacts
of
the
sort
found
to
exist
in
perkins,
and
--
and
as
we
said,
said
that
even
$4
million
in
purchases
were
not
enough.
i
think
that
all
of
those
cases
help
to
make
it
clear
why
the
mere
sales
here
are
not
enough.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
meir
feder
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
purported
integrated
distribution
that
respondents
are
pointing
to
as
the
basis
for
ignoring
the
corporate
separation
here,
whatever
else
you
could
say
about
it
and
whether
it's
really
any
different
from
normal
coordination,
it
only
relates
to
the
tiny
fraction
of
petitioners'
business
that
involved
tires
going
to
the
united
states.
so
--
where
they
didn't
normally
market
their
products
--
and
so,
of
course,
everything
that
they
sent
to
the
united
states
was
only
when
the
u.s.
affiliate
reached
out
to
get
tires.
that
does
not
--
under
any
theory
of
which
i'm
aware,
even
the
most
aggressive
enterprise
theory,
that
would
not
account
for
a
basis
for
merging
the
two
companies
and
treating
parent
and
sub
as
if
they
were
one.
as
far
as
the
hypothetical
about
china
goes,
i
wanted
to
briefly
address
that.
of
course,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
a
lot
of
tires
sent
in
from
china
or
anywhere
else
to
north
carolina
or
any
other
state,
there
will
be
specific
jurisdiction
most
likely
in
those
cases.
our
position
here
is
simply
that
the
fact
that
tires
are
coming
in,
of
which
you
may
have
specific
jurisdiction,
is
no
basis
to
say
that
you
can
also
bring
in
north
carolina
what
general
jurisdiction
would
allow
you
to
bring:
claims
from
workplace
accidents
in
china,
lease
disputes,
and
whatever
else.
mr.
meir
feder
availment.
mr.
meir
feder
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
our
law
has
a
concept
of
special
jurisdiction
like
that,
as
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause,
and
i
think
that
even
--
i
won't
purport
to
speak
for
the
respondents
in
the
other
case,
but
i
think
that
they
would
probably
agree
that
if
the
accident
had
happened
to
a
new
jersey
citizen
in
france,
that
that
would
not
create,
even
under
their
stream-of-commerce
theory
jurisdiction.
under
our
due
process
precedents,
you
need
purposeful
availment
and
for
general
jurisdiction,
of
course,
you
need
quite
a
bit
more
than
that.
and
so
while
creative,
i
don't
think
that
would
quite
carry
the
day.
mr.
meir
feder
we
--
we
do,
your
honor,
and
obviously
we
wouldn't
recognize
that
under
our
due
process
clause,
and
i
think
it
points
up
some
of
the
reasons
why,
at
least
at
the
margins,
it
is
important
to
be
able
to
negotiate
treaties
so
that
we
can
avoid
having
that
sort
of
jurisdiction
exercised
against
our
citizens,
just
as
within
the
european
community
they
have
an
agreement
that
it's
not
exercised
within
that
community.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
