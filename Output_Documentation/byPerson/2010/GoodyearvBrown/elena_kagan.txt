do
you
think
there
is
general
jurisdiction
over
the
parent?
if
the
consent
were
not
in
the
picture,
is
there?
does
general
jurisdiction
go
beyond
state
of
incorporation,
principal
place
of
business?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
horwich,
could
i
ask
you
a
different
kind
of
question,
and
i
apologize
in
advanced
for
taking
you
a
little
bit
far
afield?
but
--
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
a
particular
sentence
in
your
brief
that
seems
to
have
some
relevance
to,
not
the
general
jurisdiction
question
but
some
relevance
to
specific
jurisdiction.
so
this
is
on
page
20.
you
say:
"if
mere
purposeful
availment
of
commercial
opportunities
in
a
particular
state,
which
is
of
course
the
test
for
a
specific
jurisdiction,
if
that
purposeful
availment
were
sufficient
to
subject
an
enterprise
to
the
general
jurisdiction
of
that
state's
courts,
a
corporation
that
sold
its
goods
to
an
independent
distributor
intending
that
they
be
resold
in
all
50
states
could
potentially
be
brought
to
judgment
in
any
state
on
any
claim
against
it.
"
so
i
--
i
take
that
--
i
understand
that
to
read
that
you
think
that
it
is
purposeful
availment
that
subjects
a
company
to
specific
jurisdiction
--
not
to
general
jurisdiction,
but
to
specific
jurisdiction
--
if
a
corporation
sold
its
goods
to
an
independent
distributor
intending
that
they
be
resold
in
all
50
states.
am
i
reading
that
correctly?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
i
was
hoping
that
the
answer
would
be
yes,
actually.
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
this
is
just
a
--
this
is
an
i'm-just-curious
question:
why
do
you
care?
you
have
goodyear
usa,
which
has
consented
to
jurisdiction.
why
does
it
make
a
difference
to
get
these
other
companies
in
the
north
carolina
courts?
does
north
carolina
not
make
goodyear
usa
substantively
liable
for
this
accident?
justice
elena
kagan
so
--
but
what
you're
saying,
then,
is
that
north
carolina
treats
the
parent
and
the
subs
very
differently
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law,
but
you
would
want
identical
treatment
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction?
