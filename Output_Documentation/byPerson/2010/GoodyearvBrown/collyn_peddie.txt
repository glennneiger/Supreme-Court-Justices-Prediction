ms.
collyn
peddie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
goodyear
petitioners
ask
this
court
to
assist
them
in
avoiding
the
jurisdiction
of
the
north
carolina
courts.
this
court
should
decline
for
two
reasons.
first,
there's
nothing
new
here.
ample
evidence
supports
north
carolina's
exercise
of
general
jurisdiction
over
the
petitioners
under
very
well
established
general
jurisdiction
and
due
process
principles.
and--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--your
honor,
if
that's
--
if
that's
the
characterization
of
the
case
and
that's
all
you
had,
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
case.
our
argument
here,
and
i
think
the
--
what
the
--
what
the
evidence
in
this
case
bears
out
is
that
is
not
the
case
here.
the
characterization
of
the
case
by
both
the
government
and
by
petitioners
is
that
there
is
simply
mere
sales
here
and
they
ignore
how
the
sales
occurred.
our
focus
is
on
how
the
sales
occurred,
and
i
think
justice
scalia
made
a
--
a
correct
distinction,
that
what
we're
doing
here
is
not
talking
about
attribution,
that
--
that
sort
of
thing,
and
--
and
simply
saying
that
because
someone
down
the
line
sold
them,
without
any
other
discussion,
there's
general
jurisdiction.
that's
not
correct.
ms.
collyn
peddie
i
think
that
the
--
the
state
supreme
court
did
a
lot
of
things
right,
but,
as
we
say
in
the
brief,
we
think
that
they
took
a
detour
in
using
inappropriate
stream-of-commerce
language
that
isn't
there.
it's
not
that
they
didn't
have
help
doing
it.
for
example,
the
petitioners
have
changed
their
tune
here.
they
talked
routinely
about
purposeful
avail
--
availment
in
their
briefs
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
the
supreme
court.
for
example,
page
327
of
their
brief
requests
that
they
--
that
they
find
purposeful
availment
here.
so
the
court
had
a
lot
of
help.
but
that
part
of
the
opinion
we
don't
really
think
is
appropriate,
nor
is
it
necessary.
the
point
that
i'm
making
about
there
being
nothing
new
is
that
there
is
ample
evidence
in
this
case
to
apply
to
the
general
jurisdiction
principles
that
were
used
in
perkins
and
used
in
hall
and
that
can
cause
this
court
to
reach
the
correct
result.
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
this
court
can
affirm
on
any
basis
supported
in
the
record,
and
we
believe
that
there
is
a
basis
in
well-established
rules
supported
in
the
record,
whether
it
agrees
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision
or
not.
it's
not
bound
by
that
analysis,
nor
are
we.
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
of
waiver
because
it's
--
it's
come
up.
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
has
correctly--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--okay,
okay.
ms.
collyn
peddie
your
honor,
as
far
back
as
--
as
burger
king,
this
court
recognized
that
commercial
activities
when
they're
conducted
on
behalf
of
an
out-of-state
party
can
sometimes
be
attributed.
even
the
solicitor
general
agrees
that
there's
a
different
jurisdictional
analysis
that
may
apply
over
and
above
something
like
cannon
or
rush
v.
savchuk,
if
there
are
case-specific
interactions
between
particular
affiliated
corporations
as
you
have
here.
ms.
collyn
peddie
no,
no,
but--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--but
what
they're
talking
about
are
that
there
are
evidentiary
case-specific
interactions
between
the
parties
that
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
of
general
jurisdiction
and
thus
subjecting
them
to
suit
on
--
in
dispute-blind
--
or
dispute-blind
jurisdiction.
in
addition,
this
court
has
used
in
a
variety
of
other
areas
a
unitary
business
principle
for
local
taxation
in
mobil.
and
even
as
far
back
as
15
years
ago,
the
hague
convention,
our
trade
partners
that
are
complained
of
here,
talked
about
the
fact
that
using
--
attributing
contacts
or
counting
contacts
that
were
based
on
conduct
performed
by
others
was
appropriate
and
was
not
really
a
sticking
point
and
that
they
were
perfectly
content
to
leave
that
to
other
cases.
ms.
collyn
peddie
in
terms
of
the--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--okay.
okay.
in
this
case
i
think
it's
the
part
--
and
frankly
we'll
use
the
solicitor
general's
definition
of
a
system,
from
their
brief
at
--
at
page
23
where
they
talked
about
conduct
that
forms
a
system
and
aggregation
of
objects
united
by
some
form
of
regular
activity
or
interdependence.
using
their
definition,
i
think
you
ask
the
question:
is
a
defendant
part
of
a
continuous
business
system
or
enterprise
that
conducts
general
business
activities
in
the
forum?
and
the
first
question
you
asked
is:
is
it
a
single
system
or
an
enterprise?
this
court
has
said
in
mobil
oil
that
a
unitary
business
is
identified
by--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
under
the
sort
of
traditional
measures
that
the
court
has
used
in
terms
of
--
of
ownership,
et
cetera,
i
don't
think
there
is
anything.
but
even
the
solicitor
general
concedes
at
page
27
of
their
brief
that
the
court
of
appeals
effectively
treated
the
parent
and
subsidiary
corporations
as
an
undifferentiated
entity
for
distribution
of
the
petitioners'
product,
and
that
was
our
position
below.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--that
--
that--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--no,
no.
but
i
think
--
i
think
what
--
what
--
at
least
as
i
understood
her
question
--
and
i
may
have
misunderstood
her
question
--
was
is
there
anything
in
the
record
where,
where
they
had
done
that.
i
think
the
--
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
fact
findings
that
the
trial
court
made
about
the
existence
of
a
highly
integrated
supply
and
distribution
system
in
the
--
that
operates
in
the
state.
the
number
of
tires,
for
example,
the
petitioners
manufactured
in
north
carolina
was
determined
solely
by
orders
that
were
solicited
in
north
carolina
by
goodyear
and
forecasts
made
by
goodyear
based
on
data
that
they
gathered
there.
on
the
distribution
side,
the
testimony
from
mr.
kramer
was
that
they
don't
send
tires
for
distribution,
they
don't
do
any
distribution.
it
was
an
internal
distribution
system.
ms.
collyn
peddie
your
honor,
i
think--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--your
honor--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--your
honor,
i
think
this
goes
way
beyond
coordination.
for
example,
mr.
kramer
testifies
that,
quote,
"their
job
is
just
to
be
given
a
forecast
or
a
ticket,
and
then
they
just
build
widgets,
that's
all
they
do.
"
they
were
complete
--
their
--
their
solicitation
and
their
production
was
solely
based
on
the
control
and
the
requests
from
the
parent.
the
requests,
as
he
testified,
quote:
"emanate
from
the
request
that
goodyear
would
make.
"
and
the
production
and
supply
system
was
the
same
for
all
of
them.
on
the
distribution
side
the
testimony
was
even
more
--
i
think
was
even
more
limited,
in
that
he
said
the
plant
in
turkey
doesn't
control
any
distribution.
they
wouldn't
send
anything
into
united
states
without
the
approval
and
sanction
of
the
parent,
and
anything
else,
quote,
"just
doesn't
happen".
so
this
was
a
closed
system,
it
was
dominated
by
--
by
the
goodyear
parent,
and
there
wasn't
a
question
of
coordination.
it
was
they
didn't
produce
unless
the
parent
told
them
to;
they
sent
it
where
the
parent
said
they
should
send
it
to;
and
when
it
got
to
the
united
states,
the
testimony
is,
is
that
the
parent
controlled
it
at
that
point.
ms.
collyn
peddie
the
goodyear
regional
rhs
tire
that
was
on
the
bus
and
that
failed
was
not
generally
designed
for
the
u.s.
market,
although
it
was
brought
over
here
under
special
circumstances.
the
tires
we're
talking
about
are
of
three
kinds.
there
are
passenger
and
bus
tires
that
you
would
ordinarily
see
that
would
be
sold
individually;
second,
a
second
category
are
tires
that
were
sold
as
original
equipment
on
cars
and
buses;
and
third,
and
the
predominant
type
that
were
sent
to
the
united
states,
were
specialty
tires
for
so-called
low
boy
trailers
which
were
horse
trailers,
boat
trailers,
of
which
there
are
in
many
north
carolina.
ms.
collyn
peddie
i
think
the
distinction
between
hall
and
perkins
is
not
so
much
purchases
and
sales,
it's:
which
contacts
do
you
count?
and
the
language
that
is
sort
of
forgotten
in
hall
is
the
language
they
talk
about.
you
needed
to
have
the
same
general
business
contacts
that
you
had
in
perkins.
i
think
the
difference
is,
is
that
purchases
are
sort
of
a
one-shot
deal.
they
may
be
supplies,
but
--
they're
more
regular,
but
the
core
business
is
selling,
is
selling
items,
and
so
sales
count
more
than
purchases.
i
apologize
for
interrupting.
ms.
collyn
peddie
your
honor,
i
think
the
facts
of
that
case
are
--
is
that
one
officer
of
the
corporation
came
home,
and
he
was
--
he
maintained--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--he
was
the
president
of
the
corporation.
ms.
collyn
peddie
right.
and
the
court
characterized
that
--
i
think
there
was
a
difference
in
what
the
court
did
in
perkins
and
how
it
was
described
in
keeton.
that's
the
language
the
petitioners
have
used.
but
the
language
that
the
court
used
in
perkins
was
that
the
decision
was
based
on
the
supervisory
activities;
not
the
fact
that
it
was
the
principal
place
of
business,
but
the
fact
that
the
supervision
over,
for
example,
the
renovation
of
the
factory
after
the
war
took
place
in
the
forum.
ms.
collyn
peddie
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
a
lot
of
factors,
your
honor.
are
you
assuming
that
there's
--
it's
established
that
there's
general
jurisdiction
there,
or
are
we
in
the
same
fact
pattern
as
here?
ms.
collyn
peddie
i
think
in
theory,
they
could.
i
think
in
practice,
the
case
would
never
stay
there
because
of
the
controls
we
talked
about
on
forum
shopping,
about,
particularly,
forum
nonconvenience.
one
of
the
suggestions,
for
example,
that
we
made
is
one
may
want
to
consider
for
due
process
purposes
the
residence
of
the
plaintiff.
is
it
fair,
for
example,
to
have
a
case
in
north
carolina
where
the
plaintiff
doesn't
live
in
north
carolina,
as
they
do
here,
but
lives
in
canada?
so
that's
--
that's
one
limitation.
and
as
this
court
said
in
the
sinochem
case,
you
can
look
at
the
forum
non
convenience
before
you
look
at
the
jurisdictional
issue.
ms.
collyn
peddie
your
honor,
i
think
if
--
if
the
limitation
--
if
the
court's
view
is
basically
the
petitioners',
that
you
are
limited
to
principal
place
of
business,
state
of
incorporation,
and
physical
presence,
which
we
don't
think
is
the
state
of
the
law,
and
frankly,
if
it
were
the
state
of
the
law,
then
we
would
have
a
hague
convention
now
and
it
wouldn't
have
taken
20
years
to
negotiate.
if
--
if
that's
the
position
that
the
court
is
taking,
then
i
don't
think
that,
you
know,
this
case
represents
something
different.
i
think
that
the
state
of
the
law
is
that
--
or
at
least
the
professed
state
of
the
law
is
that
it
is
based
on
continuous
and
systematic
contacts.
ms.
collyn
peddie
your
honor,
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
is
not
so
much
attribution
as
more
of
a
merger
or
a
joint
activity.
what
we're
saying
is
that
there
is
a
system,
by
the
solicitor
general's
own
definition,
to
kind
of
interdependent
relationship
that
the
solicitor
general--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--that's
--
that's
not
borne
out
by
the
record.
it
was
represented
by
the
petitioners.
we
put
a
footnote
in
the
brief
that
the
citations
they
give
do
not
bear
that
out.
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
and
we've
read
it
twice
since
then.
it
indicates
they
were
sold
and
they
have
backed
off
on
that
in
their
reply
brief.
instead,
there
were
three
methods
of
distribution.
they
are
discussed
at
page
265
of
the
brief.
items
were
either
sent
directly
from
the
factory
to
the
buyers
that
were
identified
by
goodyear.
they
were
either
then
sent
to
goodyear
that
took
ownership
or
took
possession
of
them
when
they
arrived
in
the
united
states.
they
were
put
in
a
warehouse
and
sold
outside,
but
there
were
several
distribution
methods.
ms.
collyn
peddie
excuse
me.
page
265
of
the
joint
appendix.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
collyn
peddie
your
honor,
north
carolina
has
particularly
draconian
requirements
for
piercing
the
corporate
veil
and
alter
ego,
some
of
which
petitioners
refer
to.
for
example,
the
proximate
causation
of
the
wrong
has
to
be
related
to
the
domination
and
control,
and
so
ideally
it
would
be
great
if
we
could
go
back
and
simply
deal
with
them
and
let
them
collect
from
their--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--right.
they
have
very
--
in
most
states,
frankly,
there's
a
--
a
lesser
requirement
for
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction,
merely
allowing
the
suit
to
go
forward,
than
there
is
for
actual
imputation
of
liability
or
imposition
of
liability,
and
so
north
carolina,
i
think,
is
a
very
good
example
of
that.
they
have
a
fairly
liberal
requirement
or
state
of
the
law
that
we
cited
in
the
manly
case,
where
general
personal
jurisdiction
exists
over
a
foreign
corporation
where
it
is
controlled
by
or
controls
a
local
corporation.
and
that's
the
white
confectionary
case
that
we
cited
in
the
--
excuse
me,
the
chocolate
confectionary
case
cited
in
the
manly
case.
ms.
collyn
peddie
yes.
i
mean,
we
--
i
think
you
have
to
understand
that
this
case
is
at
a
very
embryonic
state.
we
have
done
no
discovery
in
this
case.
this
was
an
appeal,
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
the
denial
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
so
there's
been
one
deposition
on
a
very
limited
jurisdictional
issue,
so
we've
not
had
an
opportunity
to
develop
the
facts.
we
hope
we
will
be
able
to
develop
those
facts,
but
what
we're
faced
with
here
is
a
situation
where
north
carolina
would
permit
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
under
its
well-established
law
on
general
personal
jurisdiction,
but
when
it
comes
to
the
imposition
of
liability
for
substantive
purposes,
that
may
be
a
much,
much,
much
tougher
sledding.
and
so
in
order
to
preserve
the
interests
of
our
client,
we've
--
we've
gone
down
this
road
as
well.
ms.
collyn
peddie
no,
your
honor,
because
that's
not
our
position
here.
our
position
is
that
if
you
participate
in
this
kind
--
not
a
general,
but
in
this
kind
of
very
tightly
controlled
system,
distribution
and
supply
system,
then
there
is
general
jurisdiction
in
the
forum
over
the
foreign
subsidiary
that
participates
in
this.
but
simply
generally
having
a
parent
subsidiary
relationship
and
shipping
goods
into
the
forum,
that's
not
what
we're
contending.
and
frankly,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
a
situation
in
which
general
jurisdiction
would
apply.
ms.
collyn
peddie
your
honor,
they
do
talk
repeatedly
about
the
existence
of
this
highly
integrated
distribution
system.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
sort
of
flip
it
over
and
say
what
would
happen
if
we
adopted
the
petitioners'
view
that
you
ignore
the
system,
and
all
you
look
at
is
a
--
is
a
few
sales?
i
think
that
then
you
would
end
up
with
a
situation
that
would
be
unfair
to
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
terms
of
providing
a
forum
for
its
residents.
for
example,
if
i
may
give
a
hypothetical,
if
you
have
a,
not
a
manufacturing
plant
in
turkey,
but
let's
say
in
china
that
is
producing
massive
amount
of
tires
for
importation
into
the
united
states,
thousands
of
tires,
in
this
same
distribution
system,
based
on
their
view
that
it
has
to
be
principal
place
of
business,
state
of
incorporation,
and
that
mere
sales
are
not
--
don't
count,
and
it
has
the
same
jurisdiction
system,
then
even
that,
that
producer,
and
frankly,
goodyear
is
one
of
those
producers,
wouldn't
be
liable
in
north
carolina
if
the
injury
occurred
someplace
else.
ms.
collyn
peddie
your
honor,
our
--
our
position
here
is
that
you
will
incentivize
outsourcing
if
you
agree
with
the
petitioners'
view.
with
regard
to
the
existing
plants,
1,500
miles,
which
is
the
distance
from
istanbul
to
paris,
is
--
is
not
exactly
local
production.
but
what
we're
talking
about
is,
again,
something
like
the
example
that
i
gave
you
of
a
production
in
china,
that
you
have,
and
--
and
it's
based
on
the
definition
that
we
make
of
outsourcing,
which
are
jobs
that
simply
were
in
the
united
states.
if
a
ceo
is
faced
with
a
situation
of
locating
a
plant
in
--
in
north
carolina
and
subjecting
the
production
of
that
plant,
even
if
it's
completely
for
export,
and
particularly
if
it's
completely
for
export
to
the
jurisdiction,
the
general
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts,
and
can
put
that
plant
in
china
and
send
items
around
the
world
and
not
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
north
carolina,
where
do
you
think
they're
going
to
put
that
plant?
now,
i
don't
disagree
that--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--i
think
they
would
rather
be
sued
in
china.
ms.
collyn
peddie
well--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
--
well,
let
me
answer
this
in
two
ways.
the
first
way
is
the
policy
considerations,
either
on
our
side
or
their
side,
are
not
due
process
issues.
and
the
second
point
that
i
was
going
to
make
was
the
idea
that
the
due
process
clause
doesn't
trump
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
over
the
petitioners
here
based
on
policy.
instead,
it
has
to
be
a
showing
of
unfairness--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--well,
it
is
a
policy
argument,
but
i
think,
your
honor,
that
in
all
candor,
i
think
we
felt
the
need
to
--
to
respond
to
the
policy
arguments
of
not
just
the
government
but
also
to
the
other
side.
i
would
--
i
would
say,
let
me
--
if
i
might
complete
--
complete
the
other
thought,
is
that
all
of
those
considerations,
as
interesting
as
they
are,
as
compelling
as
they
may
seem,
you
know,
are
not
due
process
considerations.
this
court
really
isn't
empowered
to
restrict
the
jurisdiction
of
state
courts
based
on
assisting
the
united
states
in
negotiating
trade
treatise,
instead
it
has
to
be
based
on
unfairness
and
showing
of
undue
burden.
with
regard
to
--
getting
back
to
the--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--that's--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--and
--
and
it
would
be
tempered
by
the
--
the
--
the
burdens
test
that
is
articulated
in
asahi
and
elsewhere,
but
none
of
that
impacts,
you
know,
policy
considerations
such
as
trade
negotiations,
et
cetera.
and
the
focus
has
been
fairness
and
balance
of
interests.
and
here
you
have
a
--
a
manufacturer
and
you
have
petitioners
who
voluntarily
participated
in
an
enterprise
that
operates
in
the
state
here.
and
we
think
that
there's
nothing
unfair
about
--
when
they
agreed
to
deal
with
this,
when
they
made
money
off
of
doing
this,
when
they
do
this
on
an
ongoing
basis,
there's
nothing
unfair
about
--
about
subjecting
them
to
liability
there.
and
particularly
when
you
look
at
the
asahi
factors,
there's
really
no
burden
on
the
defendants
here.
one
of
the
things
that
the
petitioners
did
not
respond
to
in
our
--
our
brief
is
the
notion
that
no
matter
what
this
court
decides,
two
of
these
petitioners
are
going
to
be
litigating
in
a
foreign
country
anywhere.
and
the
only
thing
that
they
have
interjected
as
a
burden
is
the
presumptive
burden
of
litigating
in
another
country.
they're
going
to
be
litigating
in
another
country
unless
a
court
atomizes
this
case
and
says
that
the
petitioners
have
to
litigate
in
four
different
states.
so
there's
nothing
--
there's
nothing
to
sort
of
suggest
that
there's
--
there's
any
burden
nor,
therefore,
a
basis
for
restricting
the
jurisdiction
of
the
north
carolina
state
courts
based
on
due
process
concerns.
by
contrast
--
and
the
other
thing
that--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--that's,
that's
correct,
but
the
--
but
at
least
this
court
has
said
since
pennoyer
v.
neff
that
the
power
is
tempered
only
by
the
due
process
clause,
not
about
policy
concerns.
and,
so,
it
--
as
--
as
i
think
the
court
is
correct
that
it
may
be
perfectly
fair
to
announce
this
to
the
world,
but
it's
up
to
this
court
to
determine
whether
due
process
would
restrict
the
exercise
of
that
power,
and
it
does
it
on
an
enunciated
set
of
factors,
none
of
which
includes
assisting
the
united
states
in
negotiating
trade
treaties.
the
petitioners,
i
think
as
we've
suggested,
have
not
really
shown
any
sort
of
burden
here,
and
they
would
be
litigating
with
the
same
lawyers
in
the
--
same
lawyers
in
the
same
forum
as
their
parent.
and
the
court
has
observed
that
even
the
kinds
of
litigation
that
would
take
place,
the
burdens
on
litigating
in
a
foreign
--
foreign
forum
are
much
reduced,
and
that
was
in
1957,
the
year
that
i
was
born.
the
primary
objections
here
are
based
on
trade.
i
think
it's
--
it's
interesting
that
the
government
has
--
has
talked
about
those,
but
i
don't
think
that's
a
basis
for
restricting
jurisdiction.
ms.
collyn
peddie
well,
for
example,
the
parent
and
the
three
petitioners
all
have
principal
places
of
business
in
four
different
countries.
and
we
have
general
jurisdiction
over
the
parent
in
the
forum.
we
have
the
same
lawyers
that
are
representing
all
the
parties
in
the
forum,
and
we
intend
to
go
forward
in
the--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--well,
in
france
the
--
the
petitioners
from
luxembourg
and
from
turkey,
if
they
litigate
in
france,
they're
going
to
be
litigating
in
a
foreign
country
as
well.
and,
so,
our
question
is
why
is
it
somehow
more
convenient
to
litigate
in
france
than
it
is
in
the
united
states
when
you've
got
the
same
lawyers--
ms.
collyn
peddie
--well,
those
--
those
are
the
forum
non-convenience
issues
that
--
that
a
--
that
a
court
would
consider.
but
i'm
talking
about
the
due
process
question
in
terms
of
investigating
the
--
the
actual
burden
on
the
petitioners
in
litigating
in
the
forum.
and
the
only
thing
that
they've
really
focused
on
is
their
preference
for
that
forum,
which
is
not
a
due
process
concern.
thank
you.
