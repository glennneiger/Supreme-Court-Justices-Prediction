what
happens
--
i
will
think
it
through,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
not
consistent
with
what
i
thought
the
theory
of
your
brief
was
for
you
to
tell
the
chief
justice
that
this
is
--
the
hypothetical
was
a
new
claim.
take
--
take
the
aclu
hypothetical
that
you
discuss
in
your
reply
brief.
is
that
a
new
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
it's
a
new
claim,
then
if
--
we
don't
look
to
(d)
because
it
wasn't
adjudicated
on
the
merits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
so
you
go
to
(e).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
now
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
that
this
is
an
(e)
claim
and
that
you
will
just
fight
the
battle
on
whether
or
not
it
could
have
been
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
you're
--
and
you're
out
of
the
(d)(1),
(d)(2)
framework
that
you
have
been
arguing
up
to
this
point,
based
on
the
chief
justice's
question
and
your
response.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought
you
said
you
agreed
that
it
was.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
so
then
this
is
an
(e)(2)
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
it's
a
procedural
bar?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
it's
a
procedural
bar
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
scalia's
question.
the
question
which
we
granted,
question
one
is
whether
the
federal
court
may
reject
a
state
court
adjudication
that
petitioner's
claim
is
unreasonable
based
on
a
factual
predicate
for
the
claim
that
the
petitioner
could
have
presented
in
a
state
court
but
did
not,
and
that
describes
what
you
are
talking
about
in
response
to
justice
ginsberg.
now,
the
petitioner,
unaccountably,
has
told
us
a
few
minutes
ago
that
this
is
a
new
claim,
which
i
think
changes
the
whole
question.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
claim
is
whether
there
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
by
reason
of
the
mitigation
evidence.
and
in
that
case,
we
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
opening
question
to
you:
was
that
the
court
relied
on
different
evidence,
evidence
that
was
not
in
the
state
hearing.
and
that's
the
question,
whether
or
not
they
can
do
that,
if
this
evidence
could
have
been
presented.
and
certainly
it
could
have
been
presented.
