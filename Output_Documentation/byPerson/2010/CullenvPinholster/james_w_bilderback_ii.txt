mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
main
points
i
wish
to
emphasize
to
the
court
this
morning:
first,
because
the
california
supreme
court
rejected
mr.
pinholster's
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
on
its
merits,
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
is
unavailable
under
28
u.s.c.
section
2254(d)(1)
unless
mr.
pinholster
first
met
his
burden
of
demonstrating
that
the
state
court
rejection
of
his
claim
was
unreasonable.
he
did
not
do
that
in
this
case,
and
thus
the
lower
courts
erred
in
granting
him
habeas
corpus
relief.
second,
because
mr.
pinholster
never
even
alleged,
let
alone
proved,
that
he
could
not
have
presented
the
factual
basis
upon
which
the
ninth
circuit
predicated
its
decision
to
grant
relief
when
he
was
in
the
state
court,
2254(e)(2)
should
have
been
a
barrier
to
the
state
court
federal
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
yes.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
no,
your
honor.
the
diagnosis
itself
is
a
fact.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
there
are
a
number
of
facts
that
were
new
in
the
federal--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--well,
as
the
court
averted,
there
was
also
the
notion
that
there
was
somehow
a
limited
amount
of
time.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
he
did
not
allege
6-1/2
hours,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
that's
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
he
did
point
to
that,
your
honor.
but
we
would
note
that
the
6-1/2
hour
conclusion
drawn
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
drawn
by
the
district
court
is
not
fairly
supported
by
the
record.
but,
putting
that
aside,
the
principal
fact
that
we
are
focusing
on
that
we
think
is
a
new
and
significant
change
in
the
factual
posture
of
the
case
from
the
time
he
was
in
state
court
to
the
time
that
he
was
in
federal
court
is
the
diagnosis
of
organic
brain
damage
by
the
expert,
which
is
not
simply
the
opinion
of
the
expert,
but
a
question
of
material
fact
that
was
relied
upon
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
decision
to
grant
relief.
the
failure
to
ever
tell
the
california
supreme
court
that
petitioner
has
organic
brain
damage
and
the
centrality
of
that
factual
determination
on
the
ninth
circuit's
decisionmaking
is
--
was
a
substantial
difference
between
the
facts
upon
which
the
state
--
with
which
the
state
court
was
presented
and
the
facts
that
the
ninth
circuit
granted
--
rested
its
decision
to
grant
relief.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
those
are
--
those
are
the
significant
facts
that
we
think
are
--
are
relevant
to
the
discussion
of
whether
or
not
the
state
court
determination
should
be
or
could
properly
be
found
to
have
been
unreasonable,
was
--
was
the
difference
in
the
specificity
of
the
--
of
the
nature
of
the
claim
of
deficient
performance
in
terms
of
the
time
sheets
and--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--oh,
certainly,
your
honor.
i
understood
the
questions
from
the
court
to
be
asking
which
new
facts
were
relied
upon
in
the
decision
to
grant
relief.
certainly
there
were
new
facts
adduced
during
the
federal
proceedings
that
we
think
inveighed
against
a
grant
of
relief,
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
your
honor
points
to
is
precisely
one
of
those.
but
in
terms
of
the
new
facts
--
and
let's
be
clear
that
2254(d)(1)
is
a
rule
that
says
that
relief
cannot
be
granted
if
the
state
court
determination
was
unreasonable.
to
the
extent
that
relief
is
denied,
the
inclusion
of
new
facts
in
the
analysis
may
not
run
afoul
of
(d)(1)
at
all.
so
here,
because
the
ninth
circuit
relied
so
heavily
upon
the
organic
brain
damage
diagnosis
and
because
that
diagnosis--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
that's
not
accurate,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
i
believe
that--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--well,
he
--
he
never
said
that
if
he
had
had
the
additional
information,
that
he
would
have
diagnosed
mr.
pinholster
as
suffering
from
organic
brain
damage.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
absolutely,
your
honor.
but
i
want
to
be
clear
that
dr.
stahlberg
never
diagnosed
mr.
pinholster
with
organic
brain
damage,
even
at
the
conclusion
of
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing,
following
which
he
had
access
to
all
of
the
facts
that
habeas
counsel
was
--
managed
to
unearth
during
the
course
of
the
federal
proceedings.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
yes.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
yes.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
because
subdivisions
(d)(1)
and
(d)(2)
serve
very
different
purposes.
subdivision
(d)(2)
is
concerned
with
determinations
of
fact,
and
the
additional
language
that
the
court
points
to
was
an
attempt
to
limit
the
bases
upon
which
a
federal
court
could
overturn
a
state
court
factual
determination.
prior
to
the
passage
of
aedpa,
a
federal
court
could
overturn
a
state
court
determination
of
fact
not
simply
because
the
evidence
was
lacking,
which
is
the
current
state
of
the
law,
but
also
because
it
found
some
sort
of
procedural
defect
or
a
number
of
other
bases
that
had
grown
up
in
the
common
law.
with
the
passage
of
aedpa,
congress
limited
the
bases
upon
which
a
state
court
factual
determination
could
be
rejected
to
only
one.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
well,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
language
of
(d)(2)
was
designed
to
limit
the
bases
upon
which
a
federal
court
could
overturn
a
state
court
factual
finding.
of
course,
our
case
doesn't
really
involve--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--yes,
and
the
symmetrical
language
in
(d)(1)
is
the
language--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--i
would
disagree,
because
i
believe
the
symmetrical
language
in
(d)(1)
is
the
limitation
on
the
federal
court's
reliance
on
lower
federal
court
authority
to
overturn
state
court
factual
determinations.
prior
to
the
passage
of
aedpa,
lower
federal
courts
were
free
to
look
to
their
own
prior
precedent,
the
prior
precedent
of
the
circuit
courts,
to
say
that
the
state
court
determination
of
a
question
of
law
was
unreasonable.
in
both
statutes
--
statute
subdivision
(d)(1),
which
has
to
do
with
questions
of
law
and
mixed
questions,
the
additional
language
narrowed
the
focus
to
a
new
and
more
limited
basis
for
federal
review
or
to
find
the
state
court
determination
unreasonable.
in
(d)(2),
there
is
this
symmetrical
limiting
language
which
overturned
what
had
historically
been
several
bases
for
rejecting
a
state
court
factual
determination.
but
in
both
sections,
the
law
is
clear
that
the
examination
is
of
the
application
that
was
conducted
by
the
state
court.
the
section
itself
speaks
in
the
past
tense,
and
the
very
concept
of
reasonableness
compels
the
conclusion
that
the
state
court
determination
can
only
fairly
be
read
in
light
of
--
in
light
of
the
facts
that
were
squarely
presented
to
the
state
court.
otherwise
we
could
be
in
a
situation
where
all
of
the
facts
before
the
state
court
are
entirely
removed,
an
entirely
new
set
of
facts
are
proven
up
in
the
federal
court,
and
we're
going
to
say
that,
notwithstanding
that
wholesale
change
in
the
factual
basis
of
the
claim,
that
the
state
court
determination
was
not
merely
wrong,
but
unreasonable.
and
it
is
this
notion
of
unreasonableness,
and
it
is
the
primacy
of
the
state
court
determination
of
the
claim
that
is
the
central
feature
of
the
aedpa
reforms
to
federal
habeas
corpus.
the
point
was
to
make
state
court
determinations
the
primary
forum
for
adjudicating
federal
constitutional
claims,
and
federal
courts
were
only
supposed
to
interfere
in
those
determinations
reluctantly.
and
if
you
examine
the
language
of
aedpa,
you
will
see
that
in
--
in
many
respects
it
mirrors
the
language
of
2244,
the
"second
or
successive"
language
in
federal
court.
the
purpose
of
aedpa
was
to
enforce
upon
federal
courts
the
same
respect
for
state
court
determinations
of
claims
that
federal
courts
showed
to
their
own
prior
state
court
determinations
of
claims.
state
court
determinations
of
federal
constitutional
claims
are
not
lesser
creatures
deserving
of
less
respect
than
federal
court
determinations
of
claims.
and
here
they
put
very
specific
language
in
the
statute
that
was
designed
to
ensure
that
when
a
federal
court
is
examining
a
state
court
determination
of
a
claim,
it
limits
itself
to
only
those
facts
that
were
before
the
state
court.
and
indeed
this
court
has
specifically
said
so
in
holland
v.
jackson,
that
the
(d)(1)
determination
is
done
in
light
of
the
record
before
the
state
court.
similarly
in
the--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--and
if
a
hearing
is
appropriately
held,
that's
a
very
different
question.
but
as
this
court
stated
in
michael
williams,
if
the
2254(d)(1)
question
is
dispositive
no
federal
evidentiary
hearing
is
required.
and
that
would
be
our
position
in
this
case.
because
this
claim
survived
2254(d)(1)
scrutiny,
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing
should
not
have
been
held,
just
as
in
the
michael
williams
case
this
court
ratified
the
decision
of
the
district
court
not
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
because
the
claim
failed
under
(d)(1).
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
i
am.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
and
that's
why--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--well,
setting
aside
for
the
moment
a
point
i
hope
to
get
to,
which
is
i
believe
that
they
did
fail
under
(e)(2);
but
assuming
the
premise
of
the
question,
which
is
that
(e)(2)
has
been
satisfied
and
that
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing
might
be
appropriate,
it
makes
no
more
sense
to
conduct
a
federal
evidentiary
hearing
before
you
conduct
a
(d)(1)
analysis
than
it
would
to
conduct
a
federal
evidentiary
hearing
before
you
do
the
2254(a)
analysis
of
whether
there
is
a
federal
question,
the
2254(b)
and
(c)
analysis
of
whether
the
claim
is
properly
exhausted,
or
the
2254(d)
analysis
of
whether
the
state
court
resolution
of
the
claim
was
reasonable.
the
statute
is
laid
out
in
a
methodical,
calculated
and
logical
manner.
and
if
the
court
just
adheres
to
the
calculated,
methodical
and
logical
manner
of
the
statute--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--well,
i
would
submit
that
we
could
bring
some
much-needed
clarity
to
some
of
the
confusion
on
these
issues
if
the
--
i
think
the
plain
language
of
2254(d)(1),
which
is
retrospective
and
contextual,
is
--
was
--
is
given
its
full
force
and
effect.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
well,
the
question
--
and
i
think
the
question
the
court's
asked
seems
to
implicate
the
aclu's
hypothetical
in
their
amicus
brief.
but
the
problem
with
doing
the
(e)(2)
analysis
before
we
examine
the
reasonableness
of
the
state
court
determination
is
those
new
facts
that
were
never
presented
to
the
state
court
are
going
to,
as
it
did
in
this
case,
confound
the
court's
analysis
of
whether
the
state
court
determination
was
reasonable.
if
new
facts
arise
which
call
into
question
some
factual
determination
by
the
state
court,
or
let's
say
new
evidence
arises
which
calls
into
question
a
state
court
factual
determination,
of
course
that
implicates
subdivision
(d)(2)
and
that
--
that
implicates
subdivision
(e)(1),
neither
of
which
are
in
play
in
our
case.
but
under
those
circumstances
we
might
find
ourselves
asking
the
question,
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
new
evidence,
whether
or
not
that
evidence
is
of
such
a
caliber
that
it's
going
to
transform
the
claim.
and
if
it
so
transforms
the
claim
that
we
are
no
longer
going
to
consider
it
the
same
claim
that
was
adjudicated
by
the
state
court--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--oh,
it's
our
position
that
the
introduction
of
the
organic
brain
damage
evidence
fundamentally
changes
the
nature
of
this
claim.
so
that
this
--
the
claim
upon
which
the
ninth
circuit
granted
relief
is
a
claim
that
was
never
presented
to
the
state
court.
it
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
--
of
additional
evidence
that
tends
to
support.
and
the
best
evidence--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--well,
indeed
the
very
nature
of
their
claim
compels
the
conclusion
that
it
could
have
been
presented
earlier.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
new
evidence--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--and
again,
i
think
we
have
a
pretty
well-settled
body
of
jurisprudence
that
is
instructive
on
that,
and
that
is
the
2244(b)(2)(b)(ii)
analyses
of
when
a
claim
that
was
previously
adjudicated
on
the
merits
by
a
federal
court
can
be
revisited
in
a
subsequent
petition
that
is
filed
in
the
federal
court.
if
the
nature
of
the
claim
is
so
fundamentally
changed
that
we
are
going
to
consider
it
a
new
claim,
then
it
is
not
the
same
claim
that
was
presented
to
the
state
court.
however,
because
it
wasn't
presented
to
the
state
court,
depending
upon
the
availability
of
a
state
remedy
or
any
state
procedural
bars,
those
sort
of
traditional
habeas
corpus
limitations--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--if
--
if
that's
--
if
that's
an
appropriate
remedy.
but
the
--
the
problem
with
the
procedure
that
was
used
in
this
case
and
--
and
some
of
this
i
acknowledge
is
idiosyncratic
to
this
case
because
the
district
court
was
unaware
that
it
had
applied
until
very
late
in
the
proceeding.
but
the
problem
with
following
a
procedure
that
allows
the
development
of
evidence
notwithstanding
the
reasonableness
of
the
state
court
determination
is
you
are
very
often,
if
not
typically,
going
to
find
a
situation
where,
even
if
the
state
court's
determination
of
the
claim
was
whole
reasonable,
the
claim
has
changed
based
upon
these
new
facts
developed
for
the
very
first
time
in
federal
court,
and
then
that's
going
to
mean
that
it's
a
substantially
transformed
claim.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
i
don't
think
that
the
aclu
hypothetical
states
a
new
claim.
i
was
speaking
of
in
our
case--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--with
the
addition
of
the
organic
brain
damage
evidence.
so
i
think
that
in
the
hypothetical
that
the
aclu--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--correct.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
well,
if
it
was
--
yes,
that's
--
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
if
you
have
a
claim
presented
to
the
federal
court
that
was
never
adjudicated
on
its
merits
by
the
state
court,
and
if
we're
further
--
further
positing
that
there
is
no
available
state
court
remedy--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--if
we
assume
that
the
claim
is
a
new
claim,
if
we
assume--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--in
my
case
i
agree
that
the
facts
presented
to
the
federal
court
were
never
presented
to
the
state
court,
and
those
facts
fundamentally
transformed
the
claim
such
that
the
claim
upon
which
the
ninth
circuit
granted
relief
was
never
presented
to
california.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
no,
your
honor,
because
you
only
can
leap
to
(e)(2)
if
the
state
court
never
had
the
opportunity
to
examine
the
facts
of
the
claim
and
if
the
petitioner
can
show
that
he
could
not
have
previously
presented
the
claim
to--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--well,
depending
on
how
the
state
court
reacts
to
the
new
evidence.
yes,
if
the
state
court
erects
a
procedural
bar
then,
yeah,
this
court's
well-settled
jurisprudence
on
the
question
of
procedural
bar
is
going
to
control
whether
or
not
we
can
reach
the
merits
of
the
claim
in
federal
court.
that's
absolutely
correct.
but
here
part
of
the
problem
in
the
instant
case
is
that
the
very
nature
of
the
claim
that
they
presented
precludes
the
conclusion
that
they
could
not
have
presented
this
evidence
to
the
state
court
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
diligence.
they
have
asserted
that
any
reasonable
attorney
in
1984
at
the
time
of
the
trial
had
to
discover
the
organic
brain
damage
diagnosis
that
dr.
vinagradov
offered
in
federal
court.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
well,
of
course,
a
claim
is
made
up
of
two
components,
and
one
of
them
is
the
legal
theory
of
the
claim
and
the
other
is
the
factual
landscape
that
we
are
asking
that
legal
theory
to
be
applied
to.
so
for
example,
if
someone
were
to
present
to
a
state
court
or,
frankly,
to
a
federal
court,
a
claim
as
general
as
the
first
statement
that
you
made,
justice
kagan,
that,
"my
trial
attorney
gave
me
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
penalty
phase.
"
that
is
a
claim
that
is
void
for
vagueness.
rule
2
requires
that
you
specifically
identify
the
factual
bases
of
your
claim
to
the
federal
court
in
your
federal
petition.
and
california
has
a
similar
rule
that
requires
you
to
communicate
the
factual
bases
of
the
claim.
if
we
utterly
change
the
factual
basis
of
the
claim,
then
it
is
in
essence
a
new
claim.
i
see
that
i
am
almost
out
of
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
thank
you.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
thank
you.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
some,
but
not
all
of
them
were.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
well,
of
course,
part
of
the
problem
is
that
the
6
and
a
half-hour
figure
is
arrived
at
by
purportedly
adding
up
all
of
the
hours
spent
in
preparation--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
yes.
the
billing
records
that
the
ninth
circuit
relied
upon
were
before
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
context
of
the
clerk's
transcript
that
was
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
appeal.
however,
there
were
important
--
indeed,
the
most
important
records,
that
might
have
shed
light
on
the
amount
of
time
that
counsel
actually
spent
time
preparing,
were
never
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court.
indeed,
those
records
were
never
presented
to
the
federal
court,
and
those
were
the
records
of
mr.
dentmer.
mr.
dentmer
was
the
lawyer
principally
cast
with
preparation
of
the
case
in
mitigation
at
the
penalty
phase,
and
there
were
no
records
for
mr.
dentmer
for
the
6-week
period
leading
up
to
and
through
the
penalty
phase.
and
it--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--no.
the
6
and
a
half
hour
came
from
mr.
brainard's
records.
mr.
brainard--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--yes.
the
california
court
had
mr.
brainard's
records.
they
did--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--well,
the
--
again,
the
allegation
that
there
were
only
6
and
a
half
hours
spent
in
preparation,
that
allegation
was
never
made
through
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
yes.
the
billing
records--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--the
billing
records
--
again,
the
billing
records
upon
which
the
ninth
circuit
arrived
at
its
conclusion
that
there
were
only
6
and
a
half
hours
was
before
the
state
court.
however,
the
allegation
that
there
were
only
6
and
a
half
hours
spent
in
preparation
was
never
presented
to
state
court,
and
indeed,
the
records
presented
to
the
state
court
were
incomplete
in
a
way
that
would
not
admit
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
exactly.
but
that
allegation--
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
--no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
because
that
allegation
was
plainly
false,
based
upon
the
state
court
record.
the
state
doesn't
blindly
accept
any
factual
allegation
made
in
the
petition.
it
reviews
those
allegations
in
light
of
the
state
court
record.
and
in
this
case,
as
the
court
indicates,
the
state
court
records
plainly
show
that
the
allegation
that
they
did
nothing
to
prepare
for
the
penalty
phase
was
false,
and
indeed,
the
state
court
records
showed
that
they
began
preparing
for
the
penalty
phase
well
before
the
penalty
phase
began.
so
the
factual
allegation
that
was
presented
to
the
state
court
was
not
only
false,
based
on
the
state
court
record,
it
was
affirmatively
disproved
during
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing.
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
how
we
could
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
state
court
determination
was
unreasonable,
when
in
fact
it
was
correct.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
yes.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
the
only
point
with
which
i
would
--
i
would
take
issue
with
the
court's
characterization
is
--
i
assume
the
court
was
not
speaking
hypothetically.
the
court
is
speaking
about
my
case.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
in
my
case,
the
state
court's
doors
are
not
closed.
mr.
james
w.
bilderback
ii
because
the
exhaustion
difficulty
in
this
case,
the
exhaustion
problem
in
this
case,
is
a
consequence
of
the
errors
that
the
federal
court
made
in
doing
the
(d)(1)
--
in
failing
to
do
the
(d)(1)
determination
at
all
and
in
taking
evidence
in
clear
derogation
of
(e)(2).
if
you
ever
take
evidence
in
derogation
of
(e)(2),
you
are
going
to
end
up
with
an
unexhausted
claim,
and
that
is
precisely
what
happened
here.
