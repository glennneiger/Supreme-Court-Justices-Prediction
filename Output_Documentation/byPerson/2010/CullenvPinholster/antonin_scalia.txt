yes,
but
you
say
that,
even
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
before
the
california
court,
your
client
deserved
relief.
that
may
well
be,
but
that's
not
what
the
--
what
the
ninth
circuit
said.
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
your
client
deserved
relief
in
light
of
the
facts
before
the
california
court
plus
other
facts.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
go
back
and
answer
a
hypothetical
question
of
whether,
if
the
ninth
circuit
said
on
the
basis
of
those
facts
alone
before
the
california
court,
if
the
ninth
circuit
had
said
that,
would
that
opinion
be
affirmed?
that's
not
the
opinion
they
came
up
with.
they
added
facts.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
live
with
what
they
wrote.
and
the
basis
of
their
decision
included
additional
facts.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
very
point,
isn't
it?

page

i
spent
all
that
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kennedy,
can
i
bring
you
back
to
page
35?
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
says
accordingly
if
2254(e)(2)
were
linked
to
the
scope
of
the
evidence
before
--
it
would
exclude
only
the
new
mental
impairment
theories
--
the
new
mental
impairment
theories
introduced
in
federal
court,
and
their
exclusion
would
not
affect
our
result.
the
state
contends
that
there
--
there
was
other
factual
material,
not
just
those
theories
but
also
the
6-and-a-half-hour
time
sheet
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
at
least,
you
know,
that
really
doesn't
cover
the
waterfront
of
--
of
all
new
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say
that
they
were
on
record
in
the
state
court
is
not
to
say
that
they
were
part
of
the
record,
of
the
trial
record.
and
these
things
were
not
part
of
the
trial
record,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
--
all
that
goes
--
goes
to
the
fact-finder?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
that
goes
to
a
jury
in
criminal
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
--
that
was
on
the
assumption
that
the
only
new
evidence
would
have
been
the
evidence
of,
how
did
they
put
it?
"the
new
mental
impairment
theories
introduced
in
federal
court.
"
that
that's
the
only
new
evidence
that
would
be
--
would
be
excluded.
and
the
other
side
contradicts
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
believe
that,
you
have
nothing
to
support
it.
i
mean,
i'd
say
that's
just
lawyer's
puffery,
unless
you
come
up
with
a
record
that
shows
6.5
hours.
i
mean,
that's
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
where
the
6
and
a
half
hours
came
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
the
california
court
had.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
new
evidence,
then.
it
wasn't
new
evidence
before
the
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
are
relying
on
allegations
rather
than
the
evidence,
the
allegation
was
even
worse.
the
allegation
was
zip.
no
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
doesn't
help
you.
