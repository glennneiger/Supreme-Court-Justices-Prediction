mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
about
changes
from
state
to
federal
court,
but
if
we
limit
ourselves,
even
to
the
evidence
that
was
only
presented
in
state
court,
the
mitigation
evidence
demonstrates
an
objectively
reasonable
application
of
strickland,
and
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
on
that
basis
alone.
we
presented
a
substantial
amount
of
legal
specificity
and
factual
specificity
in
support
of
our
claim.
we
alleged
in
state
court
that
his
mom
had
run
over
his
head,
that
--
at
age
2-1/2,
and
a
year
later
his
head
had
propelled
through
the
windshield
in
a
car
accident,
and
that
it
caused
mental
and
organic
impairments
that
affect
intent
and
culpability.
and
justice
kagan
asked,
what
is
the
rule
for
the
generality
of
the
claim?
i
believe
it
is
that
which
focuses
on
what
is
legally
relevant
in
the
habeas
hearing.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
we
do
have
to
live
with
the
basis
that
the
ninth
circuit
wrote.
and
the
ninth
circuit
majority
en
banc
said
that
there
were
alternate
bases
for
granting
relief.
it
felt
that
the
(e)(2)
federal
hearing
was
compelling,
but
it
specifically
stated
that
if
you
set
aside
the
new
mental
health
theories
that
were
introduced
in
federal
court
and
focused
only
on
the
historical
upbringing
and
childhood,
and
the
mental
health
facts
alleged
in
state
court,
that
basis
and
that
basis
alone
would
support
a
finding.
and
the
dissent
mentions
this
as
well.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
yes,
an
objectively
unreasonable
application
of
strickland.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
yes--
[laughter]
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
in
our
opposition
for
cert
we
said
this,
that
we
thought
it
should
not
be
granted
because
of
the
presentation
in
state
court--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--yes,
and
it
is
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
counsel
didn't
make
a
reasoned
strategic
decision
to
put
forward
a
certain
mitigation
strategy
based
on
the
mother.
counsel
didn't
think
the
case
was
proceeding
to
penalty
phase.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
it
did
not
come
out,
justice
ginsberg.
a
few
little
pieces
of
information
were
given
by
mrs.
brashear,
mr.
pinholster's
mom.
but
there
was
no
relationship
of
how
his
traumatic
head
injuries
affected
him
and
caused
him
damage.
and
so
the
--
the
presentation
was
incomplete.
and
even
the
state's
own
expert,
dr.
stahlberg,
after
he
had
actually
seen
all
the
documents
that
he
would
have
wanted
to
receive
if
he
was
doing
a
mitigation
mental
health
phase,
he
said
it
was
profoundly
misleading.
and
it
was.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
ninth
circuit
did
make
alternative
rulings,
but
turning
to
the
question
of
the
new
evidence,
we
believe
the
new
evidence
was
properly
considered,
although
the
court
made
it
clear
that
it
would
affirm
based
only
on
what
was
on
state
court,
because
that
showing
was
so
substantial
in
and
of
itself.
but
turning
to
the
new
evidence,
there
is
a
reason
things
like
this
happen.
in
california,
the
claim
was
denied
without
any
hearing
and
without
any
explanation.
and
then
the
--
the
case
moved
to
federal
court.
and
for
the
first
time,
it's
the
state
that
starts
bringing
forth
its
mental
health
theory
to
rebut
the
offered
theory
and
starts
to
question
whether
or
not
dr.
stalberg,
who
is
our
expert,
has
a
neurology
license
and
can
opine
on
how
epilepsy
affects
intent
and
culpability.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
mr.
chief
justice,
the
california
supreme
court
didn't
tell
us
what
i
--
what
they
did.
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
procedure
for
provisionally
assuming
facts
are
true.
they
didn't
say
that
they
did
that
here.
and
the
backdrop
against
how
this
case
happened
in
state
court
is,
we
presented
all
of
the
allegations
with
affidavits
in
support
of
them,
and
the
california
supreme
court
issued
an
osc,
which
normally
means
they
think
if
the
showing
is
true,
it's
got
to
be
granted,
and
there
has
to
be
a
hearing
and
a
ruling
that
describes
the
reasoning.
then
the
state
filed
in
state
court
documents,
fairly
conclusory,
saying:
you
shouldn't
believe
dr.
woods.
he
came
into
this
evaluation
10
years
after
the
fact.
you
shouldn't
believe
him.
you
shouldn't
believe
trial
counsel.
trial
counsel
was
disbarred.
and
after
that,
the
state
supreme
court
withdraws
the
osc
and
issues
a
postcard
denial.
that
suggests
that
we
didn't
get
the
procedures
that
are
referred
to,
at
least
from
the
state's
perspective.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
i
think
that's
the
rule,
justice
alito,
but
if
that
is
what
was
done
here,
because
it
is
the
most
commonly
invoked
rule,
it
was
objectively
unreasonable,
because
in
light
of
the
presentation
that
was
made
in
state
court
--
and
i've
given
the
court
some
of
it
--
that
was
definitely
a
showing
of
an
unreasonable
application
of
strickland,
because--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--i'm
sorry,
justice
alito,
that's
not
my
argument.
i
think
there
are
many
times
where
it
would
be
perfectly
acceptable
for
trial
counsel
to
hire
a
mental
health
expert,
receive
a
report,
and
say,
based
on
what
we
have,
we're
not
going
to
use
this
route.
but
it
wasn't
acceptable
here,
because
what
happened
here
is,
they
hired
a
mental
health
expert
in
the
middle
of
the
guilt
phase
who
went
down
on
a
sunday
for
one
to
two
hours
without
any
of
the
documents
that
he
said
--
he
said
--
that
he
needed
to
do
a
proper
mitigation
investigation.
and
he
gave
them
a
letter
that
they
had
to
have
known
on
its
face
showed
dr.
stalberg
did
not
have
enough
information
to
render
a
competent
psychiatric
opinion.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
justice
breyer,
the
ninth
circuit
said:
"although
pinholster
substituted
experts
during
the
proceeding
who
ultimately
developed
different
mental
impairment
theories,
these
experts
nonetheless
relied
on
the
same
background
facts
that
pinholser
--
pinholster
presented
to
the
state
court.
"
"accordingly,
if
2254(e)(2)
were
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
evidence
before
us,
it
would
exclude
only
the
new
mental
impairment
theories
introduced
in
federal
court,
and
their
exclusion
would
not
affect
our
result.
"
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
well--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--well,
we
think
what
happened
here
was
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
court
to
hold
a
hearing.
no
hearing
had
been
held
in
state
court,
and
the
federal
court
determined
that
a
hearing
was
appropriate
because
pinholster
had
been
diligent
in
attempting
to
develop
the
facts,
and
that
is
the
test
that
this
court
has
set
forth
in
michael
williams.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
it
depends
on
how
one
interprets
the
term
"factual
predicate".
because
if
we
focus
on
mental
health
impairments
and
how
impairments
affect
intent
and
culpability
and
how
it
plays
out
on
the
specific
facts
of
the
crime,
pinholster
did
discover
those.
even
though
he
didn't
have
discovery
or
an
evidentiary
hearing,
he
did
allege
them,
and
he
should
have
been
given
a
hearing
where
he
would
have
then
further
developed
those
facts,
just
as
he
did
in
federal
court,
when
he
received
the
hearing
that
he
should
have
received
in
state
court
but
did
not.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that.
but
we
don't
need
that
view--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--i
think
we
draw
the
line
by
focusing
on
what
is
legally
relevant,
not
a
dsm
opinion.
i
have
to
say,
as
a
long-time
public
defender,
my
experience
is
that
the
mental
health
professionals
often
speak
about
the
legally
relevant
facts
in
different
ways
based
on
the
dsm;
but
to
focus
on
what
matters:
what
was
his
impairment?
how
did
it
affect
him?
he
was,
right
before
the
homicides,
at
the
house
of
a
friend
in
an
erratic
state,
saying
he
had
a
message
from
god,
brandishing
a
knife
and
putting
it
into
the
door.
dr.
stalberg,
who
did
this
mid-trial
evaluation,
said
that
that
was
extraordinarily
important
to
him,
because
it
showed
that
this
was
not
a
cold
and
calculated
murderer,
as
he
thought
when
he
didn't
have
the
information,
but
it
showed
we
had
a
severely
impaired
person.
and
he
thought,
because
of
his
epilepsy
and
mental
health
condition,
he
was
hypersensitive.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
i
think
it's
going
to
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
case
but
he's
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
time.
and
that's
the
reason
why
there's--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--because
the
opinion
is
based
on
facts.
so
the
more
differently
the
cases
look,
the
more
they
focus
on
different
underlying
facts,
different
reasons
and
how
they
affect
conduct
differently,
the
more
it's
going
to
be
difficult,
because
under
this
court's
doctrines
you
have
to
--
a
petitioner
who
wants
to
go
to
federal
court
with
new
experts,
he's
got
to
show
first
that
he's
exhausted,
and,
you
know,
that's
going
to
be
a
problem.
and
second,
that
if
he's
exhausted,
that
he
was
diligent
in
trying
to
develop
the
facts
in
state
court.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
i--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--justice
alito,
i
think
that
can
and
should
be
a
part
of
analyzing
diligence,
and
in
the
particular
hypothetical
that
your
honor
has
posed,
it
seems
like
it's
going
to
be
tough
to
show
diligence.
in
this
case,
he
does
have
good
reasons.
the
state
sat
back
in
state
court
and
didn't
really
address
the
allegations
of
mental
health
mitigation
that
weren't
developed.
they
just
simply
said,
you
shouldn't
believe
it,
it
happened
too
late.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
well--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--well,
the
state
also
says
in
its
reply
brief
that
it's
not
just
the
affidavits,
it's
the
affidavits
looked
--
looked
at
against
the
backdrop
of
the
whole
state
court
record.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
respectfully
don't,
because
the
billing
sheets
in
our
state,
there
is
a
procedure
where
counsel
have
to
submit
the
billing
sheets
to
the
court,
and
where
the
information
comes
from
is
the
clerk's
transcript
in
this
case
from
the
state
court
record.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
no,
we
said
he
didn't
prepare
at
all
in
state
court.
and
then
when
the
billing
sheets
were
revealed,
mr.
brainard,
who
is
the
lawyer
who
did
all
of
the
witnesses
at
penalty
phase,
has
an
entry,
6.5
hours.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
in
our
state
the
--
the
appointed
counsel
submits
a
987
form
under
penalty
of
perjury
saying
these
are
the
hours
i
worked;
i
want
to
be
paid;
and
it
happens
in
real
time
and
it
was
done
throughout
the
trial
and
it
is
part
of
the
clerk's
transcript
and
the
reason
the
district
court
admitted
them
in
this
case,
they
were
--
they
were
exhibits
67
through
72,
and
it's
--
they
were
admitted
because
they
were
the
records
from
the
state
court
record,
from
the
clerk's
transcript.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
well,
the
--
they
were
not,
but
the
allegation
was
that
they
did
nothing
so
it
was
even
a
stronger
allegation
in
state
court
than
was
ultimately
pursued
at
the
(e)(2)
hearings.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
well,
the
clerk's
transcript
is
part
of
the
trial
record.
the
transcript
is
--
part
of
the
record
is
usually
the
reporter's
transcript,
the
clerk's
transcript
and
the
docket.
so
that--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--well--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--oh
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
it's
not
in
the
evidentiary
portion
of
the
record
before
the
jury;
it
is
part
of
the
state
court
record.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
yes.
are
they--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--i
think
what
we
did
is
we
confirmed
the
allegation
that
we
had
made
in
state
court
which
is
just
another
example
of
why
it
was
important
based
on
these
allegations
for
pinholster
to
get
a
hearing
to
develop
the
record--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--well,
i
think
you
can,
because
the
ninth
circuit
--
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
--
if
the
court
looks
at
the
allegations
in
state
court,
there
were
--
the
allegations
regarding
counsel's
performance
was
that
they
did
not
believe
that
they
were
going
to
a
penalty
phase;
that
because
they
did
not
look
at
the
prosecutor's
open
file,
they
did
not
know
that
their
theory
that
they
really
did
not
have
a
penalty
phase
was
wrong;
and
that
they
had
no
strategic
reason--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--yes,
yes.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
yes.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
yes.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
well,
the--
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
--well,
what
the
ninth
circuit
majority
was
saying
is
that
if
there
was
some
bar
that
(e)(2)
had
to
holding
a
hearing
where
new
evidence
could
be
properly
presented,
that
it
wouldn't
matter,
because
based
on
the
record
before
it
in
state
court,
it
proved
a
strickland
violation
under
williams,
wiggins
and
rompilla;
and
it
was
objectively
unreasonable.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
well,
but
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
yes,
because
it's
the
same
--
we
have
an
automatic
appeals
and
the
habeas
is
done
in
front
of
the
supreme
court.
so
the
entire
record,
i
believe,
is
before
the
california
supreme
court,
and
it's
also
my
understanding
that
the
state
makes
the
same
argument
in
its
reply
brief,
that
it's
not
just
pinholster's
allegations,
it's
pinholster's
allegations
considered
against
the
total
record.
but
even
if
the
specific
allegation
of
6.5
hours
was
not
there,
the
allegation
was
that
counsel
had
done
nothing
to
prepare.
that
they
had
not
spent
any
time
preparing
because
they
wrongly
believed
that
they
were
not
in
a
death
penalty.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
your
honor,
the
lawyers
made
this
revelation
in
court
at
trial
in
front
of
the
famously
aggressive
prosecutor
and
the
trial
judge
who
knew
these
lawyers
and
had
sat
through
the
hearing,
and
no
one
had
any
suggestion
that
it
was
puffery
or
it
was
false.
in
fact,
the
trial
prosecutor
started
to
staunchly
defend
her
conduct
by
saying,
look,
i
offered
them
to
look
at
my
file
and
they
didn't
show
up.
which
sounds,
you
know,
strikingly
similar
to
rompilla,
where
counsel
doesn't
even
look
at
the
file
that
will
reveal
that
their
whole
defense
is
problematic
and
built
on
a
lie.
mr.
sean
k.
kennedy
it's
very
short,
but
the
report,
when
they
read
that
quick
report
on
its
face
they
had
to
know
that
he
wasn't
prepared
enough
to
render
an
opinion.
he
seemed
not
to
know
about
this
incident
about
i
have
a
message
from
god,
and
all
of
the
drinking
and
drug
use
beforehand,
and
the
report
doesn't
even
mention
the
head
injuries,
being
run
over
by
his
mother
and
going
through
the
window.
counsel
had
to
know
these
things.
first,
because
that
witness
testimony
had
occurred
days
before
dr.
stahlberg's
sunday
interview.
and
two,
at
least
at
some
point
in
time
the
mother
said
these
things
happened
and
they
had
to
know
that
that
report
didn't
appear
to
know
that
there
were
serious
traumatic
head
injuries.
