justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
we
just
clarify
what
you
mean
by
"factual
basis"?
to
be
precise,
he
didn't
--
because
he
didn't
present
the
expert
opinion
with
the
diagnosis,
or
because
the
diagnosis
was
based
on
a
series
of
facts
that
to
me
appear
to
have
been
presented
fully
to
the
state
court;
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
with
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
the
defense
attorneys
only
worked
6
hours,
the
billing
records.
i
think
that's
the
only
underlying
facts
in
the
opinion
that
appear
new;
am
i
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
we
are
only
talking
about
the
expert
opinion
facts
being
new?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
--
besides
the
opinion,
what
were
they?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
he
did
allege
that
in
his
petition
before
the
state
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
specifically,
but
he
said
that
his
counsel
didn't
prepare.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
he
pointed
to
the
fact
that
counsel
basically
said
at
the
trial,
i
didn't
think
we
were
to
have
a
mitigation
hearing,
as
proof
of
that,
correct.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
we
just
be
clear?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
that
dr.
stahlberg's
affidavit
in
the
state
court
said
that
he
had
brain
damage
of
some
sort.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
it
said
that
he
--
the
school
records
show
evidence
of
mental
disturbances
and
some
degree
of
brain
damage.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
he
did
say
--
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
--
because
he
pointed
to
epilepsy.
he
pointed
to
a
series
of
things
that
showed
some
brain
damage.
i
just
want
to
clarify.
it's
not
organic
damage;
the
issue
is
whether
the
organic
damage
created
a
dysfunctionality
that
contributed
to
the
events.
that's
what
he
didn't
know,
and
he
said:
it's
not
--
i
would
have
needed
more
information
to
figure
that
out.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
organic
brain
damage
dysfunctionality.
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
diagnoses.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
adversary
points
to
the
difference
in
language
between
(d)(1)
and
(d)(2).
justice
sonia
sotomayor
(d)(2)
refers
to
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
facts,
unreasonable
determination
of
facts
in
light
of
the
record
before
the
court,
and
subdivision
(1)
doesn't.
it
speaks
only
an
unreasonable
decision.
could
you
address
the
difference
in
the
language
and
why
that
difference
doesn't
suggest
that
the
question
of
an
unreasonable
legal
determination
should
be
based
on
the
record
before
the
federal
court,
which
in
most
instances,
the
vast
majority
of
instances,
is
just
a
state
court
record?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
there
are
exceptions
in
(e)(2)
for
hearings.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
shouldn't
the
first
subdivision
be
read
to
mean
unreasonable
legal
determination
in
light
of
the
record
before
the
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
suggesting
that
if
a
state
court
gets
a
proffer
of
evidence
from
a
state
petitioner
who
says:
i
have
a
billing
record
that
shows
that
my
attorney
worked
only
6
hours,
and
the
state
says:
we
are
not
admitting
that
billing
record
because
it
hasn't
been
authenticated,
so
we're
not
looking
at
that
fact,
and
the
federal
habeas
looks
at
what
was
proffered
and
says:
this
is
authentication
under
any
rule,
state
or
federal.
it
was
improperly
admitted,
so
their
legal
determination
was
wrong.
not
unreasonable
legal
determination
as
to
the
iac,
because
in
fact
--
i
used
the
example
of
6
hours.
the
billing
record
could
show
5
minutes,
so
that
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
person
spent
essentially
no
time
on
mitigation,
didn't
present
anything.
the
clearest
case
you
want.
you
are
suggesting
that
a
habeas
corpus
court
is
no
longer
permitted
to
look
at
that
new
evidence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i'm
going
back
to
(d)(1).
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
not
symmetrical.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
is
a
paragraph
right
after
what
you
cite
that
basically
says
unless
there
is
a
hearing.
so
--
holland
--
doesn't
stop
at
the
point
that
you
are
quoting.
it
goes
on
in
the
very
next
sentence
to
say
"unless
a
hearing
has
been
held.
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
don't
we
start
the
way
that
you
are
proposing,
which
is
to
start
with
(e)(2),
was
the
hearing
appropriately
held,
first?
and
if
it
was,
why
are
we
excluding
the
evidence
that
was
developed
at
that
hearing?
what
you
are
proposing
is
the
reverse,
to
say
we
start
at
(d)(1)--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
only
if
the
petitioner
wins
under
(d)(1),
on
proving
that
the
decision
on
the
facts
before
that
--
the
state
court
were
reasonable,
that
you
ever
get
to
(e)(2).
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
is
that
logical?
why
isn't
it
logical
to
start
with
(e)(2),
which
is
--
it
says
in
(e)(2)
these
are
the
prerequisites
to
having
a
hearing,
you
prove
you
are
entitled
to
it.
why
are
we
excluding
those
facts
from
the
decisionmakers'
consideration?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
can
tell
you
the
one
thing
you've
said
that
makes
no
sense.
there
is
nothing
logical
about
this
statute,
or
clear
about
this
statute,
as
the
legion
of
cases
that
the
lower
courts
have
addressed
in
trying
to
interpret
it,
and
as
the
legion
supreme
court
cases
that
have
dealt
with
this
statute--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--no.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
go
back
to
justice
kagan's
earlier
question
of
how
we
draw
the
line?
at
what
level
of
generality
is
sufficient
to
say
that
a
factual
basis
of
a
claim
has
been
developed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
why?
explain
why
that
--
the
opinion
is
not
a
fact,
that's
different.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
just
clarify
again
for
me?
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
do
the
billing
records,
when
do
they
get
disclosed
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
could
i
just
ask
one
clarifying
question.
in
the
second
circuit
for
many
years
you
had
the
record
on
appeal
which
the
parties
prepared,
but
you
also
had
the
record
below
which
was
sent
automatically
to
the
judges
to
review
as
well.
the
billing
records
that
we're
talking
about,
you
say
they
were
part
of
the
record
below,
would
that
automatically
have
been
sent
under
california
law
to
the
reviewing
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
clarify
the
procedure
question
i
asked
earlier:
were
the
billing
records
made
part
of
the
record
that
went
up
to
the
california
reviewing
courts?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
claiming
the
6-hour
one
didn't
go
up?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
just
asking
a
simple
question.
was
the
--
were
the
billing
records
that
were
used
ultimately
to
calculate
the
six
hours--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--were
they
before
the
california
reviewing
courts?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
if
i'm
on
the
reviewing
court,
and
the
lawyer
spent
no
time
preparing--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--when
i
was
reviewing
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals,
someone
said
he
didn't
spend
any
time
doing
x,
y,
and
z,
and
the
first
thing
i
went
to
was
the
billing
records.
do
the
billing
records
dispute
that
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i
have
to
assume
--
i
don't
have
to
assume,
but
it's
not
new
evidence.
they
had
it
before
them.
