mr.
bilderback,
i
know
that
that's
the
principal
fact
that
you
rely
upon
that
there's
a
difference,
but
could
you
give
us
a
full
catalogue
of
the
facts
that
are
different
in
the
federal
court
record
from
the
facts
that
are
different
in
the
state
court
record?
was
there
anything
other
than
the
medical
testimony
and
the
billing
sheets,
or
is
that
the
extent
of
it?
justice
elena
kagan
although
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
mr.
bilderback,
going
back
to
your
question
of
what's
a
claim.
so
the
claim
here
could
be
ineffective
assistance
at
the
penalty
stage.
or
you
could
be
saying,
no,
the
claim
is
ineffective
assistance
for
failing
to
present
evidence
of
organic
brain
damage.
that
would
be
a
narrower
understanding
of
the
claim.
or
still
narrower,
it
might
be
ineffective
assistance
for
failing
to
present
evidence
of
a
particular
kind
of
brain
damage,
frontal
lobe
brain
damage,
which
is
what
the
new
doctor
said,
as
opposed
to
what
the
old
doctor
said,
which
was
bipolar
disorder.
so
how
do
we
choose
the
level
of
generality,
if
you
will,
when
we
try
to
figure
out
what
the
claim
is?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
kennedy,
do
you
agree
with
the
state
that
there
are
two
thing
at
issue
here,
there
is
the
new
medical
testimony
and
there
is
also
the
billing
sheets?
justice
elena
kagan
oh,
but
that's
not
--
that
was
not
presented
as
evidence
in
the
state
court,
the
billing
sheets?
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
what's
important
is
that
they
are
not
--
i
mean,
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong,
but
they
were
not
part
of
the
state
court
record
on
which
the
state
court
made
the
2254(d)(1)
determination,
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
know--
