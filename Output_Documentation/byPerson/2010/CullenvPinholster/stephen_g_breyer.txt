justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
this
case
presents
no
issue.
i
mean,
if
their
holding
is
that
in
the
--
in
your
habeas
hearing
in
state
court,
the
evidence
presented
in
state
court
at
that
hearing
was
sufficient
and
was
required
--
required
that
state
court
to
find
that
you
win
on
this
issue,
the
state
court
in
holding
to
the
contrary
is
objectively
unreasonable,
then
you
win.
and
why
are
we
all
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mention
it
not
because
it
wouldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
--
again,
it
would
be
helpful
--
maybe
you
can't
do
this
from
the
top
of
your
head,
but
when
i
looked
at
the
ninth
circuit
en
banc
decision,
i
found
a
long
discussion
on
page
79
following
by
chief
judge
kozinski
in
dissent,
from
which
i
got
the
impression
that
the
majority
was
not
saying:
we
think
the
state
court
decision
here
was
unreasonable
or
violated
clearly
established
law,
based
on
the
record
before
the
state
court
on
habeas,
state
habeas.
now,
you've
just
told
me
in
the
70-page
opinion
by
judge
smith,
there
is
a
paragraph
or
something
that
says:
even
were
all
this
issue
out
of
it,
the
extra
evidence,
we
still
think
that
looking
just
at
the
evidence
before
the
state
court,
habeas,
and
just
at
their
decision,
we
think
in
light
of
all
these
things
you
now
are
bringing
up
that
that
was
a
--
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law,
or
at
least
was
based
on
an
unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts;
in
other
words,
satisfied
(d).
where
does
it
say
that?
that
would
save
me
a
lot
of
time
if
you
know
that
off
the
top
of
your
head.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
very
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
you
are,
and
i
should
have
asked
justice
scalia
beforehand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
--
i
just
want
to
be
as
clear
as
possible.
justice
scalia
read
the
sentence
on
page
35.
i
read
the
heading
from
what
judge
kozinski
says,
"our
review
is
limited
to
the
record
presented
in
the
state
habeas
petition:
that's
what
he
said.
"
"all
right.
"
now
you
told
me
that
the
sentence
he
read
means
the
majority
there
says
if
our
record
is
limited
to
the
record
--
our
review
is
limited
to
the
record
presented
in
the
state
habeas
petition,
you
still
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
but
that's
not
what
it
said.
it
said
exactly
what
justice
scalia
said
it
said,
so
--
which
is
talking
about
the
evidence
coming
in
under
(e)(2)
or
something.
now
i
see
a
nightmare
in
front
of
me
where
i
have
to
go
through
hundreds
or
thousands
of
pages
to
try
to
figure
out
whether
they
did
or
didn't
mean
our
review
is
limited
to
the
record
presented
in
the
state
habeas
petition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can
ask
you
is
that
conceded
on
both
sides?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
right,
then?
for
you
to
win,
the
first
thing
we
have
to
say
is
we
are
going
to
look
at
page
35,
and
they
say
looking
at
the
state
court
record,
the
state
courts
were,
in
effect,
unreasonable.
we
have
to
say
that
was
wrong.
we
have
to
look
through
the
evidence
and
say
that
was
wrong.
then
you
are
at
first
base.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
to
get
home,
we
then
have
to
look
at
the
new
evidence,
and
there
it's
some
combination
of:
a,
there
was
nothing
to
have
a
hearing
about,
because
there
is
nothing
here
that
lets
you
have
a
hearing;
or
b,
there
was
something
to
have
a
hearing
about
because
this
was
so
new
that
it
was
a
new
claim,
and
you
should
have
gone
to
the
state
court
first
on
that
one,
but
there
is
no
room
to
do
it.
they
don't
let
you
do
it.
so
okay,
judge
in
the
federal
court,
you
have
the
hearing.
and
now
when
you
have
the
hearing,
first
see
if
there
was
the
diligence,
and
there
wasn't.
that
gets
you
home.
that's
the
whole
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
isn't
that
a
part
of
thing
--
you
have
a
new
claim
here.
go
to
the
state
first.
