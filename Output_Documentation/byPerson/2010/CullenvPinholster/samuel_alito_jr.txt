isn't
it
the
california
rule
that
a
hearing
had
to
have
been
conducted
unless
they
concluded
that
the
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
relief
based
on
the
facts
alleged
in
the
petition?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
to
get
back
to
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked
before,
trial
counsel
did
consult
a
psychiatrist,
dr.
stalberg,
and
his
report
was
very
unfavorable.
now,
it's
your
--
it's
your
argument
that
it
was
ineffective
for
them
not
to
continue
their
search
for
a
helpful
expert
and
come
upon
drs.
vinogradov
and
olson
or
someone
like
them
during
that
period
of
time?
is
that
the
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
a
petitioner
in
the
state
post-conviction
proceeding
proffers
an
affidavit
from
one
mental
health
expert
alleging
one
type
of
mental
disorder,
and
then
after
relief
is
denied
in
the
state
court,
the
petitioner
files
in
federal
court
and
asks
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
at
which
the
petitioner
is
going
to
call
a
dozen
highly
distinguished
mental
health
experts
who
will
testify
to
a
very
different
mental
disorder.
now
has
the
petitioner
developed
the
factual
predicate
for
that
claim
in
the
state
proceeding?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
very
complicated,
just
as
your
opponent's
idea
of
what
constitutes
a
claim
is
very
complicated
and
fact-dependent.
what
--
would
it
not
be
better
to
say
that
the
petitioner
in
the
example
that
i
gave
did
not
--
was
not
diligent
in
developing
all
of
the
additional
evidence
that
could
have
been
brought
forward
at
the
state
proceeding,
assuming
that
it
could
have
been,
but
was
not
brought
forward
until
the
federal
proceeding?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
factual
predicate
of
the
claim
is
the
new
evidence
that
is
brought
forward
in
--
in
the
federal
proceeding,
and
unless
there
is
a
good
reason
why
that
wasn't
brought
forward
in
the
state
proceeding,
it
shouldn't
be
considered.
