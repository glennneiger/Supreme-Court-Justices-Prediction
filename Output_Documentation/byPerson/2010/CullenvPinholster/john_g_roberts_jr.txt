chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-1088,
cullen
v.
pinholster.
mr.
bilderback.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
dr.
stahlberg's
new
deposition?
doesn't
that
count
as
a
new
fact?
i'm
looking
at
your
brief
on
page
11.
at
a
deposition
just
before
the
evidentiary
hearing
dr.
stahlberg
revealed
that
nothing
in
the
new
material
called
into
question
his
original
diagnosis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
that
work--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--how
does
that
work,
counsel,
if
you
have
new
evidence?
my
claim
was
decided,
it
was
reasonable
under
(d)(1)
based
on
what
they
knew,
but
i've
come
up
with
new
evidence
that
i
think
could
not
have
been
reasonably
discovered
before
the
(d)(1)
hearing?
what
happens
to
that?
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
determine
whether
that
evidence
can
come
in
under
(e)(2).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
you
think,
and
i
have
trouble
understanding
the
parties'
position
on
this.
when
you
talk
about
claims,
you
don't
mean
totally
different
legal
bases;
you
mean
different
evidentiary
support.
the
claim
that
it's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
based
on
organic
--
the
failure
to
discover
the
organic
brain
damage,
you
say
might
or
might
not
be
considered
a
new
claim,
and
therefore
(d)(1)
would
not
be
a
bar
to
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then,
and
the
reason
that
doesn't
undermine
your
position
is
because
you
think
it's
evidence
that
could
have
been
discovered
and
presented
earlier?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
that.
but
if
it
were
evidence
that
could
not
have
been
discovered
previously,
then
(d)(1)
does
not
bar
looking
at
(e)(2)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it's
really
a
new
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
federal
court
can
send
it
back
to
the
state
court
for
exhaustion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
a
second.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kennedy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
finding
under
the
standards
that
we
have
applied
under
aedpa?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
to
determine
under
aedpa
that
it
was
objectively
unreasonable
for
this
lawyer
to
get
a
psychiatrist,
or
whatever
his
status
was;
to
get
a
report,
which
he
did,
and
which
he
looked
at,
in
which
the
psychiatrist
or
psychologist
said,
look,
there
is
nothing
here.
and
he
went
through
all
the
stuff
that
was
there.
and,
in
fact,
after
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing,
he
said,
well,
in
light
of
this
new
evidence
i'm
still
correct.
and
objectively
unreasonable
for
this
lawyer
to
say,
look,
my
best
bet
is
to
put
his
mother
on
the
stand,
that
that
might
engender
sympathy,
and
portray
him
as
not
as
bad
a
guy
as
everybody
says,
as
opposed
to
putting
on
all
this
evidence
that
explains
why
he's
such
a
bad
guy.
those
are
two
--
we've
said
those
are
reasonable
choices.
if
you
are
relying
on
that
basis,
we
have
to
decide
that
it
is
objectively
unreasonable
for
a
lawyer
to
proceed
on
that
basis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
pause
for
a
moment:
you
said
there
was
no
hearing
in
the
state
court.
well,
that
was
because
the
state
court,
pursuant
to
the
established
procedures,
assumed
everything
you
wanted
to
show
was
true.
it's
a
little
bit
much.
i
mean,
you
were
not
going
to
be
in
any
better
position
after
a
hearing
than
you
were
before
the
state
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
putting
your
eggs
in
the
basket
that
under
aedpa,
what
happened
here
was
objectively
unreasonable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
do
you
want
to
go
on
and
look
at
the
question
on
which
we
granted
cert
and
argue
that
we
should
look
at
the
new
evidence
or
that
the
state
court
should
look
at
the
new
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
this
--
again,
as
your
friend
pointed
out,
and
i
have
to
say
it's
a
logical
conundrum
for
me,
too
--
you
have
to
show
under
(e)(2)
that
the
factual
predicate
could
not
have
been
previously
discovered,
and
your
claim
is
that
his
lawyer
should
have
discovered
this.
they
both
can't
be
true.
and
if
the
former
is
not
true,
you
don't
get
a
hearing,
and
if
the
latter
is
not
true,
you
don't
get
relief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
say
the
state
court
--
you
just
told
us
that
this
was
better
off
because
it
is
only
6
hours,
and
you
said
in
the
state
court
they
did
nothing,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
say
they
did
nothing,
surely
that
was
rhetorical
hyperbole,
and
you
took
the
6
hours
to
say
this
proves
what
we
said,
they
did
nothing;
they
did
next
to
nothing.
you're
not
saying,
oh
well,
it
was
six
hours,
so
we
are
sorry
we
said
they
did
nothing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
gets
back
to
the
point
that
justice
scalia
was
making,
is
that
this
is
new
evidence
that
the
ninth
circuit
considered
with
respect
to
the
original.
in
other
words,
they
were
not
just
saying,
okay,
even
if
none
of
this
happened,
we
would
still
rule
against
you,
because
one
of
the
new
things
they
had
was
the
6-hour
evidence,
which
you've
just
said
makes
your
case
stronger.
i
think
it
does
make
your
case
stronger,
but
it
also
makes
clear
that
we
can't
say
let's
just
look
--
the
ninth
circuit
just
looked
at
what
was
there
originally.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
going
back
to
arguing
that,
you
win
under
the
original
proceeding
and
the
question
on
which
we
granted
cert--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--should
be
addressed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
long
does
it
take
to
read
dr.
stahlberg's
report
that
says
i've
looked
at
this,
i've
examined
this,
this
and
this
and
there
is
nothing
here
that
is
going
to
support
a
mental
impairment
theory?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
just
to
get
back
to
(e)(2),
what
is
specifically
the
factual
predicate
that
could
not
have
been
previously
discovered
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bilderback,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
