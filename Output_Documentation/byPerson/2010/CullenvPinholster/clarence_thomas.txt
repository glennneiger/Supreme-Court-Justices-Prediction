justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
scott
pinholster
and
two
accomplices
broke
into
a
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
they
brutally
beat
and
stabbed
to
death
two
men
who
happened
to
interrupt
the
burglary.
a
california
jury
convicted
pinholster
of
first
degree
murder
and
he
was
sentenced
to
death.
pinholster
twice
sought
habeas
relief
in
the
california
supreme
court.
one
of
his
claims
was
that
his
trial
counsel
had
failed
to
adequately
investigate
and
present
mitigating
evidence
during
the
penalty
phase
of
his
trial.
both
times,
the
california
supreme
court
unanimously
and
summarily
denied
pinholster's
claim
on
the
merits.
later,
a
federal
district
judge
held
in
evidentiary
hearing
and
granted
pinholster
federal
habeas
relief
under
28
u.s.c.
2254.
sitting
en
banc,
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
considering
new
evidence
introduced
in
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
california
supreme
court's
decision,
“involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law
under
section
2254(d)(1).”
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
to
consider
the
evidence
introduced
in
the
district
court
under
section
2254(d)(1)
when
a
federal
court
reviews
whether
a
state
court
unreasonably
applied
federal
law,
the
federal
court
may
consider
only
the
record
that
was
before
the
state
court
although
state
prisoners
may
sometimes
submit
new
evidence
in
federal
court,
any
new
evidence
is
not
relevant
to
review
under
section
2254(d)(1).
looking
only
at
the
state
record,
we
find
that
the
california
supreme
court
reasonably
applied,
clearly
established
federal
law.
the
clearly
established
law
here
is
strickland
versus
washington
which
provides
that
counsel
is
constitutionally
ineffective
only
when
a
defendant
shows
both
defective
performance
and
prejudice.
the
california
supreme
court
could
have
reasonably
concluded
on
the
record
before
it
that
pinholster
could
not
satisfy
either
requirement.
