justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
keep
saying
that.
but
didn't
i
understand
correctly
that
that
drug
was
withdrawn
from
the
japanese
market
in
which
it
had
originally
been--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--was
it
proven
that
it
was
as
effective?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
explain
why.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
any
provision
in
the
regulations
that
require
a
manufacturer
to
withdraw
a
drug
earlier
than
when
the
fda
tells
them
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
this
immunity
would
come
along
until
they
go
to
the
fda
and
say,
well,
we've
gotten
enough
incidents
to
prove--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
didn't
they
make
the
vaccine
court
exclusive?
there
is
plenty
of
administrative
systems
that
make
--
preclude
state
law
actions
altogether
and
place
you
in
administrative
proceedings.
so
if
their
intent
was
to
drive
out
state
lawsuits,
why
not
do
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so,
how
--
couldn't
they
have
taken
care
of
that
with
daubert?
i
mean,
won't
most
of
these
cases
get
resolved
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
point
me
to
the
fda
regulations
or
law
where
the
fda,
in
giving
a
license
to
or
permitting
a
new
vaccine,
actually
looks
at
whether
that
vaccine
is
the
most
efficacious
way
with
the
least
serious
harm
to
the
population.
is
there
a
regulation
that
requires
that
judgment
by
them
before
they
issue
permission
to
market?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
what
is
the
motivation?
if
there
is
no
--
there's
no
approval
mechanism
for
the
fda
to
look
at
that
issue,
what
is
the
motivation
for
manufacturers
to
voluntarily
remove
a
drug
that
is
causing
harm
to
the
public
before
the
fda
acts?
if
they
are
completely
immune
under
your
reading
of
this
preemption
statute,
what
motivates
them
to
act
more
quickly?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
please
just
answer
that
question?
what
is
the
motivation
for
the
manufacturer
to
either
continue
the
testing
of
their
product
and
voluntarily
stopping
it
if
a
better
design
has
been
found
by
someone
else
or
even
an
inducement
for
them
to
find
a
better
design
if
a
competitor
comes
around?
because
i
don't
see
why
they
should
stop
until
they
have
caused
as
many
injuries
as
they
need
to
before
the
fda
says
stop.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
is
the
inducement
for
them
to
do
it
voluntarily?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
am
not
asking
about
the
fda.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
said
the
manufacturers'
motivations.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
the
victim
of
that
withholding
have
a
private
cause
of
action?
i
don't
see
anything
in
this
that
would
give
them--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--or
there
is
something
better
on
the
market
than
this
that
won't
cause
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
those
64
percent
do
now?
what
is
the
percentage
of
those
people
who
actually
go
into
court
now?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
because
whatever
the
percentage
is,
proving
causation
is
never
easy--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--for
non-listed--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
are
making
an
assumption
that
has
a
flawed
premise,
which
is
that
their
only
concern
was
protecting
the
manufacturers.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
couldn't
have
been.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
only
do
they
compensate
victims,
but
they
permitted
victims
to
go
into
state
court.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
that's
your
assumption.
my
point
is
that
if
we
are
talking
about
what
the
purpose
was,
you
can't
assume
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
what
you
are
suggesting
is
there
is
no
compensation
for
an
injury
that
was
avoidable
in
its
normal
sense,
which
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
this
drug
had
not
been
sold
and
another
drug
had
been
used
the
person
would
have
avoided
their
injury.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
sounds
to
me
that
you're
going
to
win
on
non-summary
judgment.
i
don't
see
--
i
do
understand
the
cost
of
litigation.
it
can
be
very,
very
onerous.
so
i'm
not
trying
to
minimize
it,
but
i
do
think
that
there's
a
whole
lot
of
hurdles
in
place
before
a
plaintiff
wins
on
one
of
these
claims.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me
--
going
back
to
the
point
you
just
started
with--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--which
was
is
this
--
is
the
control
--
disease
center,
is
it
making
a
judgment
before
it
approves
a
drug
for
licensing,
that
it's
the
most
efficacious
drug
on
market?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--where
do
i
look
at
that?
at
what
documents
do
i
look
at
to
make
a
judgment
that
in
fact,
cdc
is
doing
what
i
ask,
that
it
is
looking
at
the
question
of
whether
this
is
the
most
efficacious
drug
with
the
least
adverse
effects?
is
that
a
judgment
it's
making?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
know
the
fda
is
not.
are
you
representing
to
us
right
now
that
cdc
makes
that
judgment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
would
include
comparisons
to
other
drugs
on
the
market?
