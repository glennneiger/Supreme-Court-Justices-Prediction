chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
afternoon
in
case
09-152,
bruesewitz
v.
wyeth.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
frederick.
what's
the
point
that
you
are
trying
to
make?
that
because
there
are
a
whole
bunch
of
provisions
designed
to
help
manufacturers,
that
this
one
can't
possibly
also
be
designed
to
help
manufacturers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
the
argument
would
go
the
other
way:
that
because
they
set
up
a
compensation
scheme,
that
was
a
good
sign
that
they
didn't
want
to
allow
state
law
claims.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
asking
us
to
interpret
this
statute
in
light
of
his
testimony
at
a
hearing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
the
language
supports
the
reading
justice
ginsburg
has
just
suggested,
or
the
government
has
just
suggested,
with
the
use
of
the
word
"the".
it
says
the
effects
of
the
vaccine
were
unavoidable,
even
though
the
vaccine
was
properly
prepared.
your
position
is,
well
--
the
question
is
whether
it
was
unavoidable
if
you
could
have
prepared
a
different
vaccine.
but
this
says
"unavoidable,
even
though
the
vaccine
was
properly.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
see
the
word
"if".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
depend,
i
suppose,
on
what
they
thought
the
judgments
were
going
to
be
in
the
1
percent
of
the
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
take
too
many
$60
million
verdicts
to
make
you
come
out
on
the
other
side
of
your
calculus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
language--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
i'm
not
sure
that
in
most
cases
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
tell
immediately
--
you
are
marketing
one
vaccine
and
something
else
is
being
tested
or
about
to
be
approved,
or
it's
on
the
market
--
that
that's
safer.
particularly
since
you
have
to
look
not
only
at
--
whatever
--
injury
and
mortality
rates,
but
also
efficaciousness
--
or
efficiency,
i
guess
--
in
terms
of
the
vaccine.
so
you
don't
know
right
away.
somebody
comes
in
and
says,
here's
a
different
vaccine;
your
vaccine
causes
one
death
every
10,000
doses,
or
whatever
it
is.
and
the
other
says,
this
is
better;
it's
one
death
every
12,000
doses.
you
say,
well,
but
ours
is
more
efficient
in
stopping
the
vaccine.
well,
how
much
more
efficient?
well,
it
depends
on
the
judgment
of
a
jury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
ms.
sullivan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
you
get
to
that,
i
think
your
answer
to
justice
sotomayor's
question
is:
nothing;
the
manufacturers
have
no
reason
to
take
the
vaccine
off
the
market
until
the
fda
tells
them
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
sullivan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
horwich.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
doesn't
make
a
determination
that
the
one
that
they
are
listing
in
their
morbidity
report
is
better
than
one
that's
out
there?
this
is
a
situation
where
there
were
two
of
them
out
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
comparison
between
the
vaccine
that
caused
the
harm
and
the
one
that
mr.
frederick's
client
says
was
more
efficacious
and
therefore
the
harms
were
avoidable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
must
be
a
situation
where
the
centers
for
disease
control
approve,
alert
people
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
particular
vaccine
that
they
think
manufacturers
should
--
should
produce,
and
there
is
another
vaccine
addressed
to
the
same
disease
already
on
the
market.
that's
never
the
case?
they
must
improve
the
vaccine--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--or
we
wouldn't
have
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
they
publish
that
information
in
their
weekly
report,
do
they
compare
it
both
with
respect
to
losses
or
mortality
and
with
respect
to
efficiency,
with
--
to
the
other
vaccines
on
the
market.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
has
not
only
given
that
information;
it
has
also
said
in
its
weekly
report
that
this
is
the
one
we
want
you
to
make.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
frederick,
take
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
mr.
horwich
told
me
that
the
cdc
does
compare
new
vaccines
to
the
ones
that
are
out
in
the
market?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
think
he
was
incorrect
in
that
assertion.
we
can
go
back
and
look
at
these
weekly
reports
and
they
are
either
going
to
say
this
is
better
than
the
one
that's
out
there
or
they
are
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
your
position
is
on
that.
do
they
compare
it
to
existing
vaccines
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
asking
about
law,
i'm
asking
matter
of
fact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
open
up
the
weekly
report.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
open
up
the
weekly
report
and
it
says
this
new
vaccine
is
better
vaccine
than
the
one
that
is
out
there
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
