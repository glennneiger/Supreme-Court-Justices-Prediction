but
you
haven't
really
answered
justice
alito's
question
as
to
why
the
later
language
is
not
surplus.
if
indeed
it
bears
the
technical
meaning
you
say
that
it
--
that
it
bears,
that
later
language
is
surplus.
justice
antonin
scalia
say
that
again.
i
don't
follow
it.
tell
me
that
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
frederick,
i
have
this
problem
with
--
with
your
interpretation.
as
--
as
has
been
said,
the
government
interprets
"unavoidable"
to
mean
unavoidable
with
respect
to
the
vaccine
that
has
been
approved.
if
it
doesn't
mean
that,
if
it
simply
means
unavoidable
with
some
other
vaccine,
you
could
always
avoid
them
if
you
have
a
vaccine
that
is
significantly
less
effective.
i
mean,
what
other
vaccine
are
you
comparing
it
with?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
the
plaintiff
comes
in
and
says,
look,
you
could
have
eliminated
this,
this,
and
this,
and
these
side
effects
would
not
occur.
of
course
the
vaccine
would
only
be
effective
in
75
%
of
the
cases,
but
nonetheless,
it
was
avoidable.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
i
acknowledge
it
rests
on
current
scientific
knowledge,
but
current
scientific
knowledge
would
enable
you
to
design
a
drug
that
does
not
have
these
side
effects
even
though
it's
significantly
less
effective,
and
there
is
no
criterion
as
to
how
much
less
effective
it
has
to
be
to
qualify
and
so
forth,
whereas
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
word
ties
it
to
a
--
to
a
particular
vaccine.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
just
as
effective?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
effective?

this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
hannah
bruesewitz
was
born
on
october
20th,
1991.
about
six
months
later,
the
pediatrician
administered
doses
of
the
diphtheria-tetanus
and
pertussis
vaccines
so-called
the
dtp
vaccine.
within
24
hours,
hannah
started
to
experience
seizures.
her
doctors
eventually
diagnosed
her
with
--
with
something
called
residual
seizure
disorder
and
developed
mental
delay.
hannah
now,
a
teenager,
is
still
diagnosed
with
both
conditions.
her
parents
filed
a
vaccine
injury
claim
with
the
national
vaccine
injury
program
in
1995.
that
no-fault
program
created
by
the
national
childhood
vaccine
injury
act
of
1986,
which
is
a
legislation
of
that
issue
here,
was
part
of
a
congressional
effort
to
stabilize
a
vaccine
industry
that
had
almost
been
destroyed
by
an
increase
in
vaccine
related
tort
litigation.
at
one
point,
only
a
single
domestic
manufacturer
continued
to
produce
the
dtp
vaccine,
and
to
facilitate
compensation
to
claimants
who
found
pursuing
legitimate
vaccines
inflicted
injuries
too
costly
and
too
difficult.
under
the
act,
the
claimants
are
not
required
to
show
that
the
administered
vaccine
was
defectively
manufactured,
labeled
or
designed.
and
for
the
most
common
and
first
side
effects,
no
showing
of
causation
is
even
necessary
if
the
injury
first
manifested
itself
at
the
express
--
at
the
expected
time
after
vaccination.
compensation
awards
are
paid
out
of
a
fund
created
by
an
excise
tax
levied
against
vaccine
manufacturers.
the
quid
pro
quo
for
the
compensation
program
was
the
enactment
of
significant
tort
liability
protections
for
manufacturers.

the

"in

action
for

the

resulted
from

that
were
unavoidable
even
though
the
vaccine
was
properly

and
was
accompanied
by
proper
directions
and

a
special
master
denied
the
bruesewitz's
claim
under
the
no-fault
program,
so
they
then
filed
this
federal
lawsuit
--
or
this
lawsuit.
as
relevant
here,
they
alleged
that
defective
vaccine
design
caused
hannah's
injuries
in
violation
of
pennsylvania
common
law.
after
wyeth
removed
this
suit
from
pennsylvania
state
court
to
federal
court,
the
district
court
held
that
the
section
in
question
preempted
the
pennsylvania
common
law
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
national
childhood
vaccine
injury
act
preempts
all
design
defect
claims
against
vaccine
manufacturers.
to
repeat
state
law,
liability
is
expressly
preempted
"if
the
injury
or
death
resulted
from
side
effects
that
were
unavoidable
even
though
the
vaccine
was
properly
prepared
and
was
accompanied
by
proper
directions
and
warnings."
if
a
manufacture
could
be
held
for
a
failure
to
use
a
different
design,
the
word
"unavoidable"
in
this
passage
would
do
no
work.
a
side
effect
could
always
be
avoided
by
designing
the
vaccine
to
omit
the
harmful
element.
it
might
be
must
--
much
less
effective
but
it
would
not
cause
harm.
the
language
of
the
provision
does
suggests
that
the
design
of
the
vaccine
is
a
given,
not
subject
to
question
in
a
tort
action.
the
expressio
unius
common
leads
to
the
same
conclusion.
products
liability
law
establishes
a
well-known
triumvirate
of
grounds
for
liability,
defective
manufacturer,
inadequate
directions
or
warning
and
defective
design.
the
text
of
the
statute
explicitly
lists
the
first
two
grounds
for
liability
as
types
of
avoidable
injury.
if
all
three
were
intended
to
be
preserved,
it
would
be
strange
to
live
the
third
defective
design
to
implication.
petitions
contrary
textual
argument
presumes
that
the
word
"unavoidable"
in
the
statutory

is
a
term
of
art
that
incorporates

to
the

which
they
contend

there
is
no
textual
reason
to
believe
that
the

was
invoking

the

while

judicial
interpretations
of
a
relevant
term
in
a
later

only
when
all

petitioner's
reading
of
the
statute
also
treats
proper
preparation
and
proper
labeling
as
additional
prerequisites
independent
of
avoidability.
that
is
to
say,
in
addition
to
the
requirement
of
unavoidability
by
whatever
means
including
redesign,
on
petitioner's
reading,
the
proper
manufacture
and
proper
labeling
are
further
requirements.
that
makes
the

section

proper
manufacture
and
proper

is
the
job
of
a
coordinating
conjunction
like
and
not
a
subordinating
conjunction
like
even
though.
the
structure
of
the
act
and
the
vaccine
regulation
in
general
reenforces
what
the
text
suggests.
a
vaccine's
fta
license
and
over
90
fda
regulations
pervasively
regulate
a
vaccine's
manufacturing
method
and
the
contents
of
its
labeling,
designed
the
vaccine
contrast
do
not
merit
a
single
mention
in
the
act
or
the
fda's
regulations.
the
lack
of
guidance
to
manufacturers
for
designed
defects
combined
with
the
extensive
guidance
for
the
two
--
two
grounds
of
liability
specifically
mentioned
in
the
statute
strongly
suggest
that
design
effects
were
not
mentioned
because
they
are
not
a
basis
for
liability.
a
mandates
contained
in
the
act
lead
to
the
same
conclusion,
designed
defect
towards
broadly
speaking
have
two
beneficial
effects.
number
one,
they
prompt
the
development
of
improved
designs
and
number
two;
they
provide
compensation
for
injuries.
the
ncbia
provides
other
means
for
achieving
both
effects.
i've
already
mentioned
the
generous
compensation
program
and
the
act
also
contains
numerous
provisions
"to
achieve
optimal
prevention
against
adverse
reactions,"
and
to
actively
monitor
the
fda
approved
vaccines.
these
provisions
once
again
suggest
that
the
statute
summons
regarding
the
design
defect
liability
reflects
a
sensible
choice
to
live
complex
epidemiological
judgments
about
vaccine
design
to
federal
officials
rather
than
the
juries.
the
final
evidence
is
the
structural
quid
pro
quo
of
the
act.
vaccine
manufacturers
fund
from
their
sales
and
informal
efficient
compensation
program.
in
exchange,
they
avoid
cause
of
litigation
and
the
occasional
disproportionate
jury
verdict.
the
congress
enacted
this
deal
to
coax
manufacturers
back
into
the
vaccine
market
but
design
defect
allegations
are
the
most
speculative
and
difficult
type
of
products
liability
claim
to
litigate,
taxing
vaccine
manufacturer's
product
to
fund
the
compensation
program
while
living
their
liability
for
design
defects
virtually
unaltered
would
be
an
odd
way
to
make
vaccine
manufacturer
more
attractive.
the
judgement
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring

sotomayor
