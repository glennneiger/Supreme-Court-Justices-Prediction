justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
can
you
--
maybe
this
is
a
good
point,
but
i
would
like
to
know
what
your
response
is.
i'm
not
asking
you
in
either
a
hostile
nor
friendly
way.
the
--
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
language,
i
cannot
find
clear
one
way
or
the
other.
so
i
think
it's
ambiguous.
at
that
point,
what
is
your
response,
on
that
assumption
that
this
brief
on
the
other
side
from
the
american
academy
of
pediatrics
and
21
other
physician
and
public
health
organizations
--
what
the
pediatricians
here
say
is
that,
if
you
win,
we're
turning
this
over
to
judges
and
juries
instead
of
the
fda
and
other
specialized
agencies,
that
the
result
could
well
be
driving
certain
vaccines
from
the
market,
and
basically,
a
lot
of
children
will
die.
and
that
--
that's
their
claim.
and
i
think
that
their
legal
argument
there
is
that
wasn't
congress's
purpose.
congress's
purpose
was
the
contrary.
so
leaving
the
language
out
of
it,
i
would
like
you
to
respond
to
what
i
would
call
that
purpose-related,
fact-related
argument
by
these
particular
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
is
another
case
on
that
where
we
are
going
to
have
to
go
into
--
which
is,
does
that
mean
every
bit
of
it
has
to
be
clear?
does
it
mean
the
intent
has
to
be
clear?
that's
a
complicated
area.
but
i
will
put
that
aside
for
the
moment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
i've
got--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that's
--
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
frankly,
if
i
see
the
academy
of
pediatrics
telling
me
one
thing,
and
i
in
an
earlier
case
wrote
the
other
thing,
i
do
tend
to
think
i
could
have
been
wrong.
[laughter]
and
that's
--
that's
why
i
am
asking
you:
is
that
the
best
you
can
find
on
the
other
side,
namely
something
i
once
wrote
in
a
case?
or
are
there
other
--
are
there
other
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
do
that?
look,
i
think
a
difficulty
i
have
is
this.
imagine
vaccine
x
saves
10,000
lives,
but
inevitably
20
children
will
be
killed.
that's
inevitable.
time
period
one.
five
years
passes.
the
manufacturer
now
realizes
he
could
save
three
of
those
five
people.
all
right.
is
there
anything
in
the
law
that
requires
him
to
tell
the
fda
that
that
is
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
there
is
nothing
that
requires
him
to
tell
the
fda
what
comes
along,
what
i
think
your
opponent
is
saying
is
at
that
moment,
it
is
no
longer
an
unavoidable
harm
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
that
says
that
unavoidable
harms
--
that
avoidable
harms
are
taken
away
from
the
courts.
so
what
is
your
response
to
that?
he's
saying
all
the
unavoidable
ones
are
taken
away,
but
not
the
avoidable
ones.
and
now
we
have
an
example
of
where
they,
ok.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
want
to
read
it
especially
to
mean
unavoidable
and
avoidable.
let's
assume
you
are
right
about
that,
or
let's
assume
it
is
at
least
ambiguous.
if
that's
so,
then
what
is
your
response
to
the
question
i
raised
before,
that
is:
that
he
says
that
if
you
allow
judges
and
juries
to
decide
only
the
question
of
avoidability,
there
will
not
be
the
harms
that
the
childhood
pediatricians
thought
there
would
be,
because
most
people
will
go
to
the
courts
--
to
the
vaccine
court
anyway.
there
are
very
few
such
cases,
and
there
will
not
be
enough
liability
to
drive
manufacturers
from
the
market.
you
heard
him
respond
to
that.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
minor
point,
but
i
thought
if
you
went
into
the
vaccine
court
you
had
to
sign
something
saying
you
weren't
going
to
go
into
a
tort
case.
i'm
wrong
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
they
get
the
information
from
the
manufacturers?
and
--
i
mean,
would
they
find
out
if
in
fact
there
had
been
a
change--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
it
was
now
--
there
is
a
safer
alternative?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
then
that
in
--
suppose
i
look
into
this,
which
i
will
do,
the
cdc
and
what
they
do.
and
suppose
i
become
convinced
you
are
completely
right,
that
this
is
a
government
agency
that
is
top
of
this
and
the
chances
of
something
going
wrong
are
very
small
and
they
will
figure
it
all
out,
together
with
the
manufacturers.
suppose
i
conclude
that.
what
do
i
do
about
this
word
unavoidable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
i
can't
say
that
the
word
unavoidable
--
it's
pretty
hard
to
say
that
that
word
unavoidable
means
avoidable;
and
i
am
in
fact
--
like
to
look
to
the
purposes
of
this
statute,
that
if
something
says
"day"
i
can't
say
it
means
"night".
and
so
--
so
what
--
what
is
it
about
this
word
that
allows
us
to
say
that
it's
avoidable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
show
that
--
remember
they
only
want
to
say,
because
of
special
circumstances
this
is
an
avoidable
--
this
is
an
avoidable
injury.
i
think
i
am
right
on
that.
and
--
and
so
the
best
place
to
look
in
your
opinion,
for
me
to
look,
to
show
that
this
word
unavoidable
includes
that
avoidable
claim,
is
where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
not
lawyers;
they
are
scientists.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
may
not
use
these
exact
words,
but
you
are
saying
whatever
word
they
use,
what
they
have
is
an
ongoing
process
to
say
this
is
the
best
vaccine
available;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
committees
have
manufacturers
on
them
and
government
scientists
and
university
people
and
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
committees
have
manufacturers
and
government
scientists
and
university
professors
and
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
their
argument
is
that
the
cdc
will
do
it
better
than
juries.
that's
what
i
heard
him
say.
