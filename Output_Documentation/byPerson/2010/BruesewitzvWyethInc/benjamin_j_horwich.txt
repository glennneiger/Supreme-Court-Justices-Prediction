mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
court
finds
itself
actually
three-quarters
of
the
way
through
the
argument
without
actually
hearing
about
the
most
important
federal
agency
that
is
involved
with
this,
which
is
arguably
not
the
food
and
drug
administration
but
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention.
and
so
with
respect
to
the
question
about
what
is
it
that
is
governing
whether
the
--
whether
the
--
the
--
a
given
vaccine
is
subject
to
the
act
and
what
are
the
incentives
and
who
is
actually
making
the
decision
and
who
is
trying
to
determine
if
there's
something
better
that's
out
there
that
we
should
be
pursuing
--
that
is
the
mission
of
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
prevention.
that
is
why
congress
took
the
original
table
--
the
vaccines
that
are
on
the
original
table
in
this
statute
were
taken
from
cdc's
recommendations
that
reflect
cdc's
expert
scientific
judgment,
based
on
the
input
from
the
medical
and
scientific
community,
of
what
vaccines
do
we
have
that
are
the
ones
we
should
use
to
protect
the
public
health?
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
let
me
--
let
me
give
--
kind
of
--
let
me
answer
that
in
--
in
two
ways.
the
--
the
first
is
that
the
--
the
nature
of
vaccine
research
is
not
something
that
manufacturers
do
in
a
cloistered
laboratory
somewhere.
so
it's
actually
very
unlikely
to
imagine
that
a
manufacturer
somehow
comes
uniquely
into
possession
of
this
knowledge.
i
mean
in
fact,
the
federal
government
spends
billions
of
dollars
doing
vaccine
research
that
government
scientists
themselves
perform.
the
government
sets
the
agenda
for
what
are
our
targets
for
development.
the
--
the
research
agenda
to
pursue
the
acellular
pertussis
vaccine
was
something
driven
by
the
federal
government.
federal
government
made
a
choice
and
said
we
--
we
don't
want
manufacturers
and
our
scientists
pursuing
the
--
the
tri-solgen
approach
and
trying
to
improve
that.
we
don't
understand
that
vaccine
very
well.
we
know
the
ultimate
target
needs
to
be
the
development
of
an
acellular
vaccine,
and
so
that's
the
research
path
that
--
to
go
on--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well
i
think--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
actually
came
in
a
question
that
justice
ginsburg
posed
to
mr.
frederick,
which
is
that
unavoidable
is
being
used
in
the
sense
of
okay;
what
are
the
vaccines
that
fda
has
approved
that
cdc
has
recommended
for
routine
administration
to
children,
and
that
are
the
--
and
that
are
the
ones
that
the
federal
government
has
determined
are
appropriate
therefore
to
protect
the
public
health?
and
given
that
that
is
the
state
of
affairs
that
we
are
in,
was
this
injury--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
think
the
way
to
understand
it
is
--
is
to
see
that
as
the
--
as
the
committee
report
--
as
the
'86
committee
report
says,
that
what
congress
is
trying
to
convey
in
using
the
word
unavoidable
is
it
is
--
it
is
respecting
the
principle
of
comment
k,
which
is
the
principle
that
socially
beneficial
products
that
nonetheless
have
these
adverse
effects
ought
to
be
on
the
market
and
we
ought
not
to
allow
tort
law
to
push
them
off
the
market,
which
is
exactly
what--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
cdc
does
not
issue
a
license.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
but
the
way
the
statute
works
is
that
the
statute
only
covers,
in
its
present
form,
the
way
--
i'm
referring
now
to
the
present
version
of
the
provision
in
the
statute
that
explains
how
vaccines
become
subject
to
the
act,
because
not
all
vaccines
are.
the
provision
is
in
14(e)
of
the
act,
which
i
believe
may
not
be
reproduced
in
any
of
the
papers,
but
it
basically
says
that
two
things
have
to
happen.
one
is
that
before
the
vaccine
becomes
subject
to
either
the
compensation
program
or
the
preemption
provision
--
is
that
cdc
has
to
recommend
it
for
routine
administration.
and
that
is
a
judgment
that
cdc
makes
with
the
advice
of
the
advisory
committee
on
immunization
practices.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
cdc
makes
that
judgment
and
announces
it
in
a
reasoned,
published
announcement
in
its
official
journal
which
is
the
morbidity
and
mortality
weekly
report.
and
so
for
every
drug
--
or
excuse
me,
for
every
vaccine
that
it
recommends
for
routine
administration,
it
publishes
a
notice
in
its
journal
explaining,
this
is
--
these
are
the
products
that
we
are
recommending
for
routine
use,
this
is
the
--
the
studies,
this
is
the
development
of
them,
this
is
our
basis
for
this
determination.
and
so--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
it
--
there
often
won't
be
other
drugs
actually
on
the
market
to
compare
it
to,
but
there
will
be
--
there
will
be
a
vast
body
of
scientific
literature
that
again
is
not
exclusively
within
the
manufacturers'
control,
because
it
has
been
produced
by
the
federal
government,
by
other
countries'
public
health
agencies,
by
academic
scientists,
that
cdc
will
reference
or
its
advisory
committee
will
have
incorporated
in
its
recommendation.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
there
--
there
were
not
two
out
there,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
the
time
of
this
there
was
--
there
were
two
forms
of
the
--
out
there
--
i'm
sorry,
if
i
can
ask
at
what
time
you
are
referring
to?
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
right,
and
i'm
not--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes,
certainly.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
certainly
they
do.
and
i
mean,
the
federal
government--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
let
me
give
you
an
excellent
example
of
that
which
is
probably
familiar
to
the
court,
that
there
are
two
types
polio
vaccines.
there
is
the
sabin
vaccine,
with
is
associated
with
certain
very
rare
but
severe
side
effects
but
which
is
extremely
efficacious
at
protecting
a
population,
and
then
there
is
the
salk
vaccine,
which
is
not
associated
with
those
same
side
effects,
but
is
not
as
effective
at
protecting
the
population.
now
cdc
made
a
determination
and
this
was
a
determination
in
effect
from
the
1960s
through
the
1990s,
that
the
sabin
vaccine
--
the
one
that
is,
quote,
unquote,
"less
safe",
was
the
appropriate
one
for
use
because
it
better
served
the
public
health.
now
as
polio
--
now
this
is
a
dynamic
process
that
cdc
is
continually
engaged
in,
and
so
as
polio
approached
global
eradication
and
you
are
not
as
concerned
about
actual
control
of
disease
running
in
the
community,
cdc
transitioned
its
recommendation
to
the
salk
vaccine.
so
i
--
i
think
that
answers
the
question
that
the
cdc
is
making
determinations
in
this
regard
in
a
comparative
way;
and
i
think
it
would
be
extraordinary
then
to
have
juries
--
to
have
--
to
imagine
that
congress
set
up
a
system
in
which
juries
would
effectively
be
second-guessing
decisions
like
that,
because
cdc
has
made--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes,
now.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
correct.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
and
part
of
the
on
going
process,
as
we
described
in
our
brief,
is
a
unique
system
of
monitoring
and
following
up
when
there
are
adverse
events.
so
that
we
gave
the
example
of
the--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
my
understanding
is
actually
the
manufacturers
are
--
are
--
are
relatively
less
represented
on
these
--
on
these
committees.
in
a
sense
that
the
manufacturers
are
sometimes
doing
the
manufacturing,
but
a
lot
of
the
research
agenda
is
really
driven
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
if
--
if
i
may?
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes,
absolutely
there
is,
because
that
claim
is
either
in
the
nature
of
a
labeling
claim
or
in
the
nature
of
a
manufacturing
defect
claim.
and
the
--
the
district
court
here
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
treated
that
question
not
under
preemption
but
on
the
facts,
summary
judgment
in
this
case
was
granted
purely
on
the
absence
of
a
disputed
issue
of
material
fact--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--with
respect
to
those
claims.
