in
a
question
of
fact
in
a
case-by-case
determination
in
every
state,
the
manufacturers
would
probably
be
worse
off
under
your
approach
than
if
they
didn't
have
the
law
at
all,
because
the
law
seems
to
at
least
qualify

anthony
m.

does
the
secretary
--
does
the
secretary
have
the
authority
to
--
to
withdraw
certification
on
the
ground
that
it
is
no
longer
safe,
fair,
and
potent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
assuming
that
the
manufacturer
knows
something
that
the
secretary
doesn't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
you
assume
that
there
is
no
clause
or
burden
to
the
manufacturers
who
defend
these
suits
to
assess
settlement
offers.
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
tremendous
expense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
--
it
may
well
be
that
the
manufacturer
has
to
settle
a
meritorious
case;
we
all
know
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view,
when
does
the
manufacturer
have
to
come
forward
and
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
defect
in
the
design?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
the
manufacturer
is
slow
or
remiss
or
negligent
or
willful
in
not
giving
the
information
to
the
government,
there
is
nothing
the
injured
person
can
do.
there
is
still
complete
preemption,
under
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
warning
doesn't
have
to
say,
"warning:
we
could
make
something
better
if
we
wanted
to.

i'm
still
not
clear
--
i'm
still
not
clear
what
answer
you
gave
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
saying:
why
didn't
congress
put
this
out
in
plain
words:
there
should
be
no
liability
for
design?
is
the
answer
sloppy
drafting?
are
you
reluctant
to
give
that
answer?
