ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
the
national
childhood
vaccine
injury
act
against
the
backdrop
of
a
wave
of
tort
litigation
that
threatened
to
drive
manufacturers
out
of
the
business
of
providing
the
vaccine--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--because,
justice
sotomayor,
the
kind
of
lawsuits
that
caused
congress
concern
were
the
very
kind
of
lawsuits
that
are
expressly
preempted
by
22(b)(1),
and
that
is
design
defect
claims,
which
have
the
exact
problem
that
was
just
being
discussed.
for
a
design
defect
claim,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
the
challenge
that
is
brought
to
the
vaccine
that
was
approved
by
the
fda
can
be
challenged
as
less
safe
than
some
alternative
vaccine,
bounded
only
by
the
imagination
of
the
experts.
it
was
those
design
defect
claims
that
were
the
problem.
congress
preserved--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--not
design
defect
claims,
your
honor.
just
to
go
back
to
1986
and
what
the
crisis
was.
as
the
1986
house
report
makes
clear,
the
manufacturers
were
being
driven
out
of
the
vaccine
business,
imperiling
the
nation's
design
--
vaccine
supply
by
design
defect
claims
that
did
survive
summary
judgment.
and
that
did
lead
to
the
danger,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
of
settlements.
the
key
point
about
protection--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--there
is
not,
justice
sotomayor.
what
the
fda
is
empowered
by
regulation
to
decide
under
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
is
whether
the
vaccine
is
safe
and
efficacious.
once
approved--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--the
act
itself.
but
section
27
of
the
act
--
let
me
just
go
back
and
describe
what
congress
did
in
1986.
it
said,
we
have
a
crisis,
and
it
created
three
things
to
solve
the
crisis:
a
preemption
provision
that
said,
let's
end
the
design
defect
claims
that
are
causing
the
problem.
let's
provide--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
ginsburg,
let's
go
back
to
the
text
and
put
--
read
the
two
clauses
together.
and
our
main
point
here
is,
as
justice
alito
and
justice
scalia
have
already
pointed
out,
the
petitioners
render
the
"even
though"
clause
surplusage.
we
read
the
two
clauses
together.
and
let's
read
them
together
against
the
backdrop
of
the
three
kinds
of
product
liability
claims
that
could
be
brought:
design
defect,
manufacturing
defect,
and
failure
to
warn.
the
--
the
statute
references
two
out
of
the
three.
and
we
--
we
believe
that
--
and
the
government
believes
that
the
reason
that
was
done
was
to
say
that
the
third
omitted
kind
of
claim,
design
defect
claims,
were
preempted.
the
two
that
were
allowed
--
and,
justice
sotomayor,
this
is
what
makes
it
different
from
straight
pure
administrative
schemes
--
this
does
preempt
defect
claims,
the
omitted
claim.
it
allows
manufacturing
defect
claims
and
it
allows
warning
claims
subject
to
the
presumption
in
22(b)(2).
limited--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--well,
justice--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--yes.
first
of
all,
justice
sotomayor,
justice
kennedy
is
correct,
the
fda
can
order
removal
from
the
market.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
but
the
reason
why--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--and
--
and,
justice
sotomayor,
the
reason
why
the
fda
has
never
had
to
use
that
nuclear
option
is
that
it
--
it
works
closely
with
manufacturers
long
before
it
needs
to
be
used,
and
that's
because
of
the
rest
of
the
structure
of
the
act.
i
would
like
to
focus
on
what
congress
did
in
1986
in
addition
to--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
so
the
--
section
27.
section
27
distinguishes
vaccines
from
other
drugs.
section
27
says
that
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
shall
--
shall
have
an
affirmative
mandate
to
promote
safer
vaccines
and
to
reduce
the
number
of
side
effects.
and
the
vaccine
act
didn't
just
eliminate
design
defects--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--of
design
defect
claims,
justice
kennedy,
but
not
of
warning
claims.
and
it
will
--
there
are
grave
consequences
if
a
manufacturer
withholds
knowledge
of
adverse
effects
from
the
fda.
section
22(b)(2)--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--there
is
not
a
freestanding
cause
of
action.
but
if
you
look
at
22(b)(2),
you
see
that
the
manufacturer
will
lose
his
--
lose
its
presumption
that
its
warnings
were
correct.
it
will
be
subject
to
warnings
suits
in
state
court
if
it
withholds
information
from
the
fda
without
the
benefit
of
the
presumption.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
and
if
you
look
at--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--always
avoidable.
exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
and
that's
how
the
text
makes
sense.
to
go
back
to
the
text,
the
text
says
there
are
two
kinds
of
avoidable
side
effects:
side
effects
that
come
from
improper
preparation
--
well,
of
course
the
manufacturer
can
avoid
those;
it
can
prepare
the
vaccine
better
without
contaminants
--
and
it
can
avoid
warning
defects
by
changing
the
warning.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
it
does
not.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
that's
because--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--but
look.
mr.
frederick
has
told
a
story
that
perhaps
has
misled
the
court
into
thinking
there
was
a
safer
vaccine
in
the
1980s.
there
was
not.
and
just
to
be
--
just
to
tell
the
story
of
a
success
in
the
way
that
fda
worked
with
the
scientific
community
and
the
national
government
worked
with
manufacturers
to
produce
a
safer
vaccine,
it
was
the
federal--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--yes.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
ginsburg,
tri-solgen
was
a
split
cell
vaccine.
it
was
manufactured
and
produced
by
lily
in
the
60s
and
withdrawn
in
the
70s.
but
mr.
frederick
was
incorrect
that
the
government
ever
deemed
it
as
effective
and
safer
than
the
wholesale
vaccine,
tri-immunol,
that
was
administered
in
this
case.
if
i
could
refer
your
honor
to
page
19
of
the
respondent's
brief,
we
cite
to
50
--
federal
register
51051
and
52.
that's
where
the
fda
specifically
determined
that
tri-solgen
was
not
safer,
was
not
safer,
than
tri-immunol
with
respect
to
seizure
disorders
or
other
severe
effects.
it
simply
may
have
involved
less
local
effects
like
fevers
and
rashes.
so
there
was
never
any
government
determination
that
tri-solgen
was
safer.
in
fact,
tri-solgen
came
off
the
market.
why?
because
the
section
27
worked,
the
federal
government
worked
to
promote
safer
vaccines--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--there
is
not
anything
that
requires
him
to
tell
the
fda
that
is
so--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that
"unavoidable"
in
the
statute
is
a
term
of
art.
and
to
the
extent
that
comment
k
is
relevant
at
all,
mr.
frederick
says,
"oh,
congress
was
adopting
comment
k,
the
majority
view.
"
well,
first,
there
was
not
a
majority
view.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
first,
there
will
be
enough
liability
to
drive
manufacturers
from
the
market.
let
me
correct
some
things
that
mr.
frederick
said
that
were
not
true.
the
vaccine
court,
99
percent
of
those
who
receive
monetary
judgments
in
vaccine
court,
the
administrative
no
fault
system,
do
accept
their
award,
but
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
those
who
lose
in
the
administrative
system
and
then
go
take
their
second
bite
at
the
apple
in
state
court,
whereas,
as
has
been
mentioned,
they
are
not
bound
by
any
findings
in
the
vaccine
court.
23(b)
says--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--no.
you
go
into
a
vaccine
court
and
there
is
an
exhaustion
requirement.
22(b)(1)
must
add
something
to
the
exhaustion
requirement.
we
say
it
adds
an
exemption
preemption
provision,
but
you
can
elect
at
the
end
to
take
the
judgement
or
not.
those
who
get
money
in
vaccine
court,
99
percent
take
it.
what
we
are
worried
about
is
the
64
percent
who
lose
in
vaccine
court.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's
true,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
but
there
are
5,000
claimants
in
vaccine
court
now
who
claim
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
mumps,
measles,
and
rubella
vaccine
and
autism.
they
have
lost
all
six
test
cases
and
when
the
individual
cases
are
resolved,
that
is
5,000
potential
claimants
in
state
court.
congress
was
worried
about
episodic
waves
of
fear
about
vaccines
leading
to
future
litigation.
they
took
care
of
existing
claimants
with
vaccine
injuries
back
in
1986
with
the
compensation
system.
the
reason
they
put
in
22(b)(1)
was
to
prevent
future
litigation
in
state
court
where
manufacturers
could
be
driven
from
the
market
by
the
fear
of
liability
that
had
in
1986
involved
the
withdrawal
of
insurance,
the
escalation
of
insurance
costs,
the
withdrawal
of
one
manufacturer
from
the
vaccine
market.
and
today
there
are
very
few
vaccine
manufacturers
and
the
risk
of
the
vaccine
supply
on
which
the
nation's
protection
from
contagious
disease
depends,
it
depends
upon
the
existence
of
that
stable
supply
of
vaccines--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--your
honor,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
you
have
to
look
to
the
rest
of
the
structure
of
the
acts
to
see
what
congress
did
here.
it
did
three
things.
it
made
vaccines
quite
different
from
other
drugs.
and
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
fda
has
to
monitor
11,000
drugs,
of
which
it
wouldn't
even
care
if
they
came
off
the
market.
the
government
doesn't
care
if--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that's
right--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--your
honor,
congress
enacted
a
preemption
provision
that
we
think
it
was
in
the
four
corners
of
the
provision
of
22(b)(1),
"preempts
design
defects".
it
has
a
carveout
for
the
two
kinds
of
suits
that
are
allowed,
manufacturer
and
warning
defects.
the
clear
holding
of
the
rest
of
the
text
is
that
design
defect
claims
are
precluded.
compensation
makes
sure
that
people
who
do
have
injuries
from
vaccines
are
taken
care
of.
the
rest
of
the
structure
of
the
act
injects
the
federal
government
into
driving
the
vaccine
development
process
in
a
way
that
it
does
not
for
other
drugs.
congress
wants
people
to
take
vaccines.
it
wants
us
to
inoculate
all
our
children.
it
wants
us
to
have
compensation
to
ensure
people
who
are
injured
that
they
can
get
some
money
to
take
care
of
their
children's
disabilities.
but
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
it
was
driving,
that
the
federal
government,
the
fda,
the
centers
for
disease
control,
together
with
the
ama,
together
with
task
forces,
were
driving
research
to
make
safer
vaccines.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
not
at
all,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
they
compensate
the
victims.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
for
manufacturing
and
warning
claims.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
two
purposes:
compensation
and
the
protection
of
the
vaccine
supply.
justice
sotomayor,
the
clearest
way
that
i--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--no--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--well,
there
is
no
such
drug
here.
acellular
vaccine
was
not
approved
by
the
fda
for
use
in
infants
under
two
until
1996.
it
was
approved
for
children
over
two
in
1991.
that's
because
in
this
country,
we
require
clinical
studies
that
weren't
required
in
japan
a
decade
earlier
to
make
sure
that--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
sotomayor,
manufacturing
claims
and
warning
claims
are
susceptible
to
summary
judgment.
design
defect
claims
are
not
in
the
same
way.
you
are
shadowboxing
against
an
infinite
number
of
theories
about
how
there
could
have
been
a
safer
vaccine.
but
the
clearest
way
i
can
say
why
mr.
frederick's
interpretation
can't
be
right
is:
if
you
concede
at
least
one
purpose
was
to
protect
manufacturers,
to
protect
the
vaccine
supply,
in
addition
to
compensating
the
victims,
mr.
frederick's
reading
of
22(b)(1)
does
not
serve
that
purpose.
he
reads
22(b)(1)
to
leave
manufacturers
in
the
exact
same
place
after
the
act
that
they
were
before.
go
to
state
court.
try
to
show
that
there
was--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that's
not
quite
right,
justice
ginsburg.
the
act
allows
all
losers
in
vaccine
court
to
go
to
state
court.
there
are
5,000--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--for
vaccine
court
winners,
that's
true.
for
vaccine
court
losers,
the
fear
was
that
these
lawsuits
would
drive
manufacturers
out
of
the
market,
even
if
the
manufacturers
could
win
in
the
end.
for
a
preemption
provision
to
do
any
work,
it
needs
to
attach
at
the
beginning
of
the
claim.
22(e),
for
example,
refers
to
bringing
an
action.
22(b)(1),
to
do
any
work
to
protect
manufacturers,
has
to
attach
to
prevent
the
cause
of
action
from
being
brought.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
well,
justice
kennedy,
it
could
have
been
drafted
a
different
way
and
it
would
have
meant
the
same
thing.
we
think
the
best
way
to
read
the
two
clauses
together
"unavoidable",
"even
though",
is
to
refer
to
what
comment
k
meant.
now,
comment
k
used
the
term
"unavoidable".
we
know
congress
was
thinking
about
the
term
unavoidable.
we
know
that
because
in
the
1986
house
report
the
congressional
committee
say
we
would
like
to
enact
the
principle
of
comment
k.
well,
what
is
the
principle
of
comment
k?
the
principle
of
comment
k
is
there
are
so
products
so
useful
that
we
want
them
to
stay
on
the
market
without
design
defect
liability.
they
can
only
be
sued
for
manufacturing
or
warning
defects.
those
are
the
only
two
kinds
of
suits
you
can
bring.
in
our
view,
comment
k
was
congress's
denomination
of
vaccines
as
comment
--
sorry,
22.1
was
the
denomination
of--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--as
a
comment
k
product.
thank
you.
