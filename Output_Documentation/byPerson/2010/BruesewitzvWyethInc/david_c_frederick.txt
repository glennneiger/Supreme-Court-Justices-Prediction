mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
vaccine
designed
in
the
1940s
that
was
administered
to
hannah
bruesewitz
in
1992,
some
30
years
after
scientists
discovered
a
safer
way
to
design
the
pertussis
component
of
the
dtp
vaccine.
the
third
circuit
held
that
the
bruesewitzes
could
not
pursue
a
design
defect
claim
under
state
law
invoking
the
preemption
principle
in
claiming
that
the
vaccine
act
of
1986
preempted
the
bruesewitz's
state
law
claim.
that
holding
is
in
error
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
court
overlooked
the
numerous
provisions
of
the
act
protecting
manufacturers
from
liability,
but
it
did
not
expressly
preempt
design
defect
claims.
second,
the
court
misconstrued
the
word
22(b)(1)'s
federal
law
defense.
and
third,
the
court
adopted
a
policy
that
exposes
children
to
unnecessary
safety
risks.
with
respect
to
the
first
reason,
in
the
1986
act
congress
created
a
program,
the
vaccine
program,
that
was
funded
by
surcharges
on
the
vaccines
that
users
used,
and
out
of
that
fund
designed
a
program
to
pay
compensation
to
persons
who
were
injured
by
vaccine-related
acts.
congress
also
provided
a
mechanism
for
exhaustion
through
the
vaccine
court
program
before
a
person
claiming
injury
could
pursue
a
state
law
cause
of
action.
in
creating
federal
law
defenses
to
the
state
law
that
was
designed
to
govern
such
actions,
congress
established
certain
defenses,
but
all
of
those
defenses
apply
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
there
are
no
absolute
provisions
that
preclude
a
state
law
claim.
the
third
circuit
misunderstood
that
basic
principle.
the
defenses
that
the
vaccine
act
created
for
manufacturers
includes
such
things
as
a
regulatory
compliance
defense
for
failure
to
warrant
claims,
a
learned
intermediary
doctrine
that
is
instituted
at
a
national
level,
the
imposition
of
comment
k--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--my
point
is
that
when
one
looks
at
the
specific
language
of
22(b)(1)
against
the
backdrop
of
these
other
provisions,
it's
clear
what
congress
was
intending
was
to
enact
a
national
defense,
but
not
to
displace
state
law
completely.
and
the
question
presented
is
whether,
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
the
design
defect
claims
that
had
been
brought
by
the
bruesewitzes
are
displaced
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
if
one
looks,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
sections
21,
22,
and
23
of
the
act,
what
21
provides
is
that
the
claimant
can
elect
not
to
accept
the
vaccine
court
judgment.
section
22
provides
the
standards
of
responsibility,
and
section
23
provides
the
mechanisms
for
trial
of
the
state
law
claim.
and
23(e)
provides
that
the
evidence
of
the
vaccine
table
and
what
happens
in
the
vaccine
court
shall
not
be
admissible
in
the
state
law
claim.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
what
congress
was
intending
to
do,
justice
alito,
was,
with
the
word
"unavoidable",
to
use
a
word
that
had
a
settled
meaning
in
the
common
law.
and
that
settled
meaning
referred
to
the
design
of
the
product
in
light
of
the
current
state
of
scientific
knowledge.
that
grew
directly
from
comment
k,
the
section
402a
of
the
restatement
of
torts.
and
in
comment
k,
which
tracked
the
structure
of
the
restatement
provision
itself,
the
general
rule
for
the
restatement
was
strict
liability
for
dangerous
products,
quote,
"although
the
drug
is
properly
manufactured
or
properly
warned
against.
"
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
certainly
was
a
debate.
the
majority
view,
however,
was
to
adopt
comment
k
as
a
defense
to
strict
liability
claims
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
and
the
cases
that
we've
set
forth,
i
think,
illustrate
that,
even
the
cases
that
the
other
side
cites.
several
of
them
had
been
overruled
by
the
time
the
1986
act
took
effect
and
there
was
a
decided
shift
in
favor
in
the
case-by-case
application
of
comment
k.
and
in
the
1987
report,
congress
made
very
clear
it
intended
to
preserve
that
case-by-case
approach.
that
is
set
forth
at
page
50
of
our
brief,
justice
alito.
so
when
one
looks
at
both
the
words
that
congress
used
in
22(b)(1),
the
debates
that
occurred,
and
the
committee
reports
that
explained
what
congress
is
intending
here,
we
believe
the
intent
is
unmistakably
clear
to
adopt
comment
k
as
a
defense
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
is
not
surplus
if
one
reads
comment
k
and
understands
what
the
drafters
there
were
intending
to
get
at,
which
was:
if,
based
on
current
scientific
knowledge,
the
risks
are
unavoidably
unsafe,
meaning
there
is
no
way
in
science
we
can
design
a
safer
product,
there
will
be
a
defense
to
a
claim
of
strict
liability
unless
or
provided
that
the
product
is
properly
manufactured
and
warned
against.
this
was
a
proviso
that
was
intended
to
ensure
that
the
focus
be
kept
on
the
unavoidable,
unsafe
aspects
of
the
design
of
the
vaccine.
now,
the
other
side's
view
takes
other
words
of
22(b)(1)
and
renders
them
surplusage.
and
i
am
looking
now
at
page
19a
of
our
reply
brief,
where
we
set
forth
the
statutory
language,
if
you
want
to
follow
along
here.
what
the
other
side's
view
is
that
after
the
word
1,
1988
--
i
am
at
page
19a
of
the
reply
brief,
the
addendum.
under
their
view,
all
of
the
words
that
follow
the
word
"if"
and
through
"even
though"
becomes
surplusage,
because
under
their
reading
the
manufacturer
is
relieved
of
all
liability
if,
quote,
"the
vaccine
was
properly
prepared
and
was
accompanied
by
proper
directions
and
warnings.
"
and
renders
the
entire
concept
of
unavoidability
surplusage.
so
our
view
is
that
what
these--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--under
their
--
justice
scalia,
looking
at
(b)(1)
on
page
19a
following
the
date
october
1,
1988.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
under
their
view,
after
the
word
"if",
the
phrase
"the
injury
or
death
resulted
from
side
effects
that
were
unavoidable
even
though.
"
is
surplusage,
because
in
their
view
of
the
statute
congress
created
a
complete
exoneration
from
liability
if
the
vaccine
was
properly
prepared
and
was
accompanied
by
proper
warnings.
they
took
the
concept
of
unavoidability
completely
out
of
the
statute.
and
the
word
"unavoidable"
had
a
settled
meaning.
there
were
numerous
cases
that
had
construed
that
meaning
in
light
of
the
20-year
history
of
restatement
section
402a.
so--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
ginsburg,
that
position
is
incorrect.
and
there
is
empirical
evidence
indicating
that
the
manufacturers,
lederle's
mr.
johnson,
testified
that
the
problem
with
the
'86
version
of
the
statute
was
that
it
allowed
for
design
defects
to
go
forward.
and
he
urged
there
to
be
a
regulatory
compliance
defense.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
what
i'm
saying
is
that
congress
had
choices,
and
one
of
the
choices
was
to
adopt
a
regulatory
compliance
defense
for
design
defect
claims,
and
it
chose
not
to
do
that.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
right.
and
it
is
preceded
by
the
word
mr.
chief
justice.
and
if
suggests--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it's
right
after
the
date,
1988.
if
--
if
the
injury
resulted
from
side
effects.
so
it
is
looking
on
a
case-by-case
basis
in
that
context,
whether
the
vaccine
created
the
injury
or
side
effect
that
is
being
complained
of.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
scalia,
let
me
try
to
clear
this
up
in
this
way.
all
of
these
vaccines
are
approved
by
the
fda.
and
the
question
is
whether
you
give
a
presumption
of
design
correctness
for
all
time
based
on
the
fda's
approval
of
that
vaccine.
this
vaccine
was
approved
in--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
that's
why
the
concept
of
unavoidability
as
a
defense
always
rested
on
the
current
state
of
scientific
knowledge.
in
the
1960s,
lederle
signed--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
the
way
these
cases
were
construed,
and
we
have
cited
them
in
our
reply
brief,
the
standard
was
whether
or
not
it
was
as
safe
as
a
feasible
alternative
but
was
--
sorry,
as
efficacious
but
safer
as
a
feasible
alternative.
that's
how
the
courts
--
the
state
court--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
has
to
be
efficacious.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
sure.
i
will
concede
that
point.
the
problem
here
was
that
an
efficacious
design
existed
as
of
the
1960s
and
the
internal
documents
indicated
that
lederle--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
let
me
clarify.
there
are
two
theories
by
which
there
was
a
design
defect
claim.
one
concerned
a
product
by
eli
lilly
called
tri-solgen.
that
was
a
split
cell
vaccine
that
was
developed
and
sold
in
the
1960s.
it
was
demonstrated
to
have
far
less
serious
effects
for
encephalopathy
and
other
residual
seizure
disorders
and
problems.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
it
was,
and
it
had
65
%
of
the
market.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
the
second
one
for
justice
sotomayor.
this
was
an
acellular
technique
that
had
been
studied
in
the
united
states
in
the
1950s
and
eventually
was
developed
by
the
japanese
in
the
1980s.
that
acellular
technique
was
eventually
approved
by
the
fda
in
the
mid-1990s
and
is
now
common
in
all
of
the
three-part
vdap
vaccines
that
are
currently
on
the
market.
our
point
is
that
the
scientists
literally
knew
about
that
acellular
technique.
they
were
beginning
to
do
tests,
but
they
didn't
aggressively
do
it
for
economic
reasons.
and
that
has
never
been--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
there
is
a
reasonableness
standard.
the
standard
of
due
care
that
state
law
and
tort
has
always
had
is:
what
does
a
reasonable
manufacturer
do
in
the
same
or
similar
circumstances?
but
that
is
a
question,
ultimately,
of
fact,
whether
or
not
the
economics--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
kennedy,
that
was
the
whole
design
of
the
vaccine
program,
because
if
you
channelled
most
claims
into
something
that
the
manufacturers
didn't
have
to
defend
against
or
pay
the
judgments
of,
the
thought
was
that
the
vast,
vast
majority
of
people
would
never
go
to
state
court.
and
it
would
only
be
in
those
rare
circumstances
like
the
problem
we
have
here
where
the
vaccine
court
awards
nothing
that
the
bruesewitzes
even
had
to
go
to
state
court.
had
they
filed
their
claim
a
month
earlier
when
residual
seizure
disorder
was
still
on
the
vaccine
table,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
was
a
debate
in
the
scientific
community.
the
institute
of
medicine
believed
that
residual
seizure
disorder
was
medically
proved
to
be
a
causative
factor
from
the
pertussis
component
of
the
dtp.
there
was
a
disagreement
of
--
by
folks
in
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
sufficient
to
justify
legal
cause.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
and
it
was
a
proceeding,
justice
ginsburg,
that
had
allowed
for
no
discovery
against
the
drug
manufacturer.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
our
submission.
and
that
was
the
design
that
congress
intended.
that's
why
what
happens
in
the
vaccine
court
under
section
23(e),
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
inadmissible
in
a
subsequent
state
court
action.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
i
may,
let
me
make
two
points,
justice
breyer,
the
legal
point
and
the
policy
point.
the
legal
point
is:
this
court's
cases
make
clear
that
there
is
a
clear
statement
principle.
before
congress
is
presumed
to
have
displaced
state
law,
it
must
act
with
a
clear
statement.
and
that
is
true
in
the
eleventh
amendment
context
as
well
as
the
preemption
context.
so
if
you
conclude
there
is
ambiguity,
we
should
win--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--here,
22(a)
answers
that
question
as
a
matter
of
law,
because
it
says
the
state
law
provides
the
general
rule.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
now,
that's
the
legal
point.
the
policy
point
is
that
by
channelling
the
vast
majority
--
and
the
sg's
brief
says
99
percent
of
the
people
who
go
through
vaccine
court
accept
the
judgment
of
the
vaccine
court.
and
on
the
first
circuit,
the
schaefer
decision
--
which
you
wrote,
justice
breyer
--
said
that
even
in
the
instances
in
which
people
lose
in
the
vaccine
court,
they
may
regard
the
hurdles
and
obstacles
of
the
state
court
process
to
be
so
great
that
they
don't
bother
to
try.
it's
difficult
to
win
these
kinds
of
cases
in
state
court--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
proving
causation
and
proving
the
availability,
based
on
science,
of
an
alternative
design
is
not
something
that
is
a
relatively
easy
thing
to
do.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
happened
in
the
moment
to
come
to
mind,
justice
breyer.
[laughter]
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
threat
of
liability
is
only
a
realistic
one
if
there
is
a
threat
that
there's
actually
going
to
be
payment
at
the
end.
and
plaintiffs
do
not
bring
cases
to
lose;
they
bring
cases
if
they
have
a
reasonable
prospect
of
winning
based
on
what
the
evidence
would
show
a
design
defect
to
be.
and
so
when
congress
set
up
this
system
and
it
exonerated
the
vaccine
makers
of
99
percent
of
all
cases
that
are
going
to
go
through
this
system
claiming
defects
or
problems,
if
you
ask
manufacturers
around
the
country
that
you
get
a
special
defense
against
punitive
damages,
you
get
a
regulatory
compliance
defense
for
failure
to
warn,
you
have
to
have
a
trifurcated
proceeding,
and
you
are
not
going
to
have
to
pay
damages
or
defend
the
actions
99
percent
of
the
time,
most
manufacturers
in
the
united
states
would
take
that
bargain.
and
so
the
question--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
that's
why,
going
back
to
the
wording
of
the
statute,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
section
23,
where
congress
said
for
someone
who
had
elected
not
to
accept
the
judgment
in
21,
you
get
to
go
to
state
court
and
try
to
prove
your
claim.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
but
you
have
to
fight
through
the
defenses
that
congress
erected
in
22(b)(1),
(b)(2),
and
(c),
which
are
quite
difficult
defenses--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--a
harder
case,
but
not
one
that
couldn't
be
proved
under
state
law.
the
negligence
inquiry
would
look
into
whether
or
not
a
reasonable
manufacturer
would
have
tried
earlier
and
more
aggressively
to
obtain
fda
approval.
here,
we
think
we
can
meet
that
standard,
because
we
had
a
drug
that
was
on
the
market,
the
split
cells
tri-solgen,
that
was
proved
to
be
safer
and
just
as
efficacious,
and
it
had
been
on
the
market
until
wyeth
took
it
off,
after
wyeth
concluded
that
when
it
purchased
the
rights
from
eli
lilly
it
couldn't
manufacture
the
vaccine
tri-solgen
in
a
way
that
it
would
get
it
the
profit
stream
that
it
wanted--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
that
was
used
for
all
through
the
series
for
children's
vaccination
for
dtp.
and
the
problem
here
with
the
other
side's
approach,
fundamentally,
is
that
not
only
does
it
render
part
of
22(b)(1)
surplusage,
and
not
only
does
it
ignore
the
many
benefits
that
manufacturers
got,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
allows
for
an
exoneration
from
liability,
even
for
manufacturers
who
know
there
is
a
safer
design
available.
and
that
fundamentally
is
something
congress
never
would
have
imagined,
that
manufacturers
would
invoke
an
immunity
from
suit,
even
when
they
knew--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
there
is--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
our
submission,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
for
many
vaccines
there
is
no
safer
alternative,
and
there
could
be
no
design
defect
claim.
but
for
those
instances
in
which
there
is
a
safer
alternative,
the
burden
under
state
law
is
for
the
manufacturer
to
act
reasonably
in
pursuing
the
safer
design,
if
that
is
available.
it's
not
--
there
is
no
provision
in
the
fda
regulations
or
under
statute
for
the
fda
to
engage
in
a
comparative
safety
analysis.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
and
this
very
vaccine,
justice
sotomayor,
was
taken
off
the
market
in
1998.
and
the
product
that
wyeth
used
as
the
substitute
for
it
says
in
its
package
insert,
this
is
a
safer
vaccine
than
the
tri-immunol
that
we
have
taken
off
the
market.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
the
manufacturers
win
that
case,
probably,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
only
if
you
accept
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
but,
justice
kennedy,
that's
after
an
exhaustive
process
through
which
they
have
gone
through
the
vaccine
program
and
the
person
is
dissatisfied
with
the
remedy
that's
provided.
so
in
these
vast
majority
of
cases,
unlike
drug
cases
where
there
is
no
channeling
mechanism,
here
the
vaccine
fund
is
designed
to
take
care
of
the
vast,
vast,
vast
majority
of
those
kinds
of
claims.
and
it's
only
in
those
rare
circumstances
where
there
would
be
a
state
lawsuit.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
manufacturer
is
subject
to
ongoing
reporting
requirements
under
section
28
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
that
if
you
think
there
is
ambiguity
in
the
text,
as
justice
breyer
suggests,
we
can
go
to
the
structure
of
the
statute.
and
let
me
just
mention
a
number
of
features
of
the
statute--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you.
the
only
law
cited
by
the
government
today
was
section
14
of
the
vaccine
act.
it
is
not
reproduced
in
the
materials,
but
it
is
--
the
title
of
section
14
is
a
vaccine
injury
table.
it's
about
recommendations
that
the
cdc
makes
as
to
which
vaccines
will
be
on
the
vaccine
table,
so
that
when
the
person
goes
through
vaccine
court
process,
you
can
look
and
determine
whether
or
not
on
a
no-fault
basis
the
vaccine
is
listed
on
the
table
or
not
listed
on
the
table--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it's
not
that
the
cdc
would
be
wrong,
justice
alito.
there
is
a
difference
between
strict
liability
and
a
no-fault
arrangement
and
where
negligence
would
be
asserted
that
a
reasonable
manufacturer
would
have
come
forward
with
information
about
a
safer
design.
so
what
congress
explicitly
rejected
and
they
voted
this
down
in
the
energy
and
commerce
committee
was
a
regulatory
compliance
defense
solely
on
the
basis
that
the
fda
had
approved
at
the
time--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
yes,
that
would
be
a
viable
design
defect
claim.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example
right
out
of
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case.
in
1965
lederle's
researchers
determine
that
lily,
the
tri-solgen,
had
a
245
of
the
joint
appendix.
that
was
in
1967.
eight
years
later
the
internal
scientists
at
lederle
wrote
a
memo
to
the
head
of
lederle
and
said
we
recommend
that
we
approach
lily
for
its
pertussis
vaccine
process
and/or
continue
to
bid
on
foreign
contracts
for
this
product
line
with
the
intent
of
increasing
volume.
they
had
made
the
determination
they
were
not
capable
internally
of
doing
a
safer
design
and
they
knew
that
for
eight
years
and
they
nonetheless
kept
the
wholesale
pertussis
in
its
market
and
the
documents
in
this
case
indicate
they
did
it
for
economic
reasons.
and
the
whole
idea
behind
having
design
defect
claims
is
to
put
manufacturers
to
the
duty
of
putting
out
safest
possible
products
in
light
of
what
the
science
holds.
the
cdc
--
there
are
no
regulations
that
the
government
cites
in
its
brief
or
today
saying
that
the
cdc
does
the
kind
of
comparative
analysis
for
safety
that
is
provided
under
state
law
design
defect
claims.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and,
justice
breyer,
there
are
now
six
dtap
vaccines
on
the
market
that
cdc
doesn't
distinguish
between
them,
but
if
it
comes
to
pass
that
the
science
would
indicate
that
one
of
them
was
woefully
not
as
safe,
and
here,
their
argument
is
that
the
vaccine
industry
is
going
to
go
out
of
business.
this
vaccine
that's
at
issue
in
this
case
was
taken
off
the
market
in
1998.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
he
cited
no
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
and
if
you
compare
that
to
what
congress
wrote
in
the
statute,
our
submission
is
that
congress's
words
in
section
22
take
precedence.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
found
no
law
that
gives
the
cdc
the
authority--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--whether,
i'm
not.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i'm
not
aware
that
the
cdc
does
the
kind
of
granular
comparisons
that
would
go
to
the
level
of
safety
that
is
at
issue
in
this
kind
of
case.
and
that's
what's
important
here.
we
are
talking
about
trying
to
eliminate
some
of
the
most
horrifying
and
horrible
incidents
of
injury
to
vaccines
that
we
compel
children
to
take.
and
the
whole
idea
behind
congress's
scheme
was
to
balance
having
vaccine
supply
available
with
providing
a
generous
form
of
compensation
to
those
persons
who
would
be
injured.
