section
22(b)(1)
refers
to
side
effects
that
were
unavoidable
even
though
the
vaccine
was
properly
prepared
and
was
accompanied
by
proper
directions
and
warnings.
if
the
term
"unavoidable"
was
intended
to
carry
its
ordinary
meaning,
what
need
was
there
for
the
rest
of
that
language:
"even
though
the
vaccine
was
properly
prepared
and
was
accompanied
by
proper
directions
and
warnings?
"
if
it
was
improperly
prepared
or
didn't
have
the
proper
directions
and
warnings,
then
the
side
effects
are
avoidable.
so
that
language
is
surplus,
isn't
it,
if
"unavoidable"
really
means
unavoidable?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
isn't
it
true
that
at
the
time,
there
was
a
distinct
minority
view
that
you
could
not
recover
for
design
defects
for
vaccines?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
happen
if
a
drug
manufacturer
sought
fda
approval
of
an
alternative
vaccine
and
the
injury
occurred
during
the
period
while
that
was
under
consideration
by
the
fda?
that's
--
that's
just
too
bad?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
something
that
mr.
horwich
said?
under
your
understanding
of
this
scheme,
if
a
--
a
person
suffered
a
very
serious
injury
as
a
result
of
the
sabin
vaccine
during
the
period
when
the
cdc
recommended
that
over
the
salk
vaccine,
would
the
--
would
that
injured
person
have
a
claim
for
design
defect
if
the
person
could
--
could
produce
experts
who
said
the
cdc
was
wrong,
that
they
should
never
have
made
this
recommendation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
this
may
be
--
this
may
be
what
congress
wanted
and
may
be
the
better
policy,
but
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
would
permit
a
lay
jury
relying
on
experts
produced
in
court,
the
cdc
got
this
wrong,
the
salk
vaccine
was
really
the
better
one.
