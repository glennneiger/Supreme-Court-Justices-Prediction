i
take
it
that
the
government
is
urging
that
fda
approval.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
could
it
be
used
for
all
five
--
there
are
five
inoculations
in
this
series.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
only
one
of
them
was
not
approved
for
the
first
three.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there
is
a
safer
alternative,
it
must
be
pursued
regardless
of
cost?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
was
it
taken
off?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
didn't
the
special
master
find
what
--
in
the
compensation
proceeding
that
causation
had
not
been
proved?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
--
you
say
that
in
court
you
could
prove
causation,
because
you
had
discovery,
although
you
couldn't
prove
it
before
the
special
master
because
discovery
was
very
limited?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
anyone
could
go
to
the
state
--
i
mean,
somebody
who
won
in
the
vaccine
court
could
go
to
court
on
the
argument
that
the
amount
was
insufficient,
the
amount
of
compensation.
there
is
--
there
is
no
foreclosure
of
anyone
to
come
to
court;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
--
when
it
was
--
when
tri-solgen
was
owned
by
lilly
and
you
said
that
it
was
approved
and
marketed,
was
that
one
available
for
all
five
inoculations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
sullivan
--
ms.
sullivan,
if
congress
had
wanted
to
do
that,
they
could
have
said
simply
that
no
vaccine
manufacturer
may
be
held
civilly
liable
if
the
vaccine
is
properly
prepared
and
accompanied
by
proper
directions
and
adequate
warnings.
that
would
have
been
the
simplest
statement.
congress
didn't
make
that
statement.
they
were
asked
to
amend
the
statute
to
make
that
statement,
and
they
didn't.
i
mean,
if
you
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
there
is
no
design
defect
liability,
then
say
that:
no
civil
liability
unless
inadequately
--
improperly
prepared,
improper
directions,
or
warnings.
what
they
--
the
language
that
they
used
is
certainly,
to
say
the
least,
confusing.
this
unavoidable
--
these
side
effects
that
were
unavoidable.
well,
why
did
they
need
to
put
that
in
there
if
what
they
were
concerned
with
was
to
cut
out
liability
for
design
defects?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
warning--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
warning
--
the
warning
claims,
the
manufacturing
claims,
those
are
always
avoidable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
so
what
can
be
--
the
only
thing
that
can
be
unavoidable
is
the
design
defect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
can
you
--
can
we
be
concrete
and
concentrate
on
this
tri-solgen,
which,
according
to
mr.
frederick--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--eli
was
producing,
and
it
was
available
for
all
five
inoculations.
and
then
wyeth
bought
it,
and
then--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
congress
were
so
clear,
as
you
are
describing
it,
then
why
didn't
it
adopt
the
provision
that
said
failure
to
develop
a
safer
vaccine
would
not
be
grounds
for
liability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
also
was
directed
to
vaccines.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
failure
to
develop
a
safer
vaccine
would
not
be
grounds
for
liability,
and
congress
didn't
enact
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
set
up
this
whole
compensation
scheme
where
everybody
agrees
--
i
mean,
the
manufacturers
got
this
compensation
scheme
which
took
most
of
the
cases
out
of
state
court.
so
to
say
they
were
left
just
like
they
were
before,
before
they
were
exposed
to
all
these
claims
--
now
it's
only
to
a
very
small
part
of
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
yes.
i
got
that
answer
from
mr.
frederick
before.
but
most
of
them
don't,
because
it's
cheaper,
faster,
and
working
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
horwich,
would
you
--
would
you
explain
one
feature
of
this,
it
was
the
allegation
that
there
were
an
unusual
number
of
adverse
reactions
to
the
particular
lot
that
this
child's
third
vaccine
came
from,
and
that
those
adverse
reactions
were
not
disclosed
to
the
doctors.
and
the
doctors
--
the
child's
doctor
said
if
i
had
known
about
the
unusual
number
of
adverse
reactions,
i
never
would
have
used
this
vaccine.
is
there
any
actionable
claim
for
that,
for
not
disclosing
that
there
were
a
number
of
adverse
--
an
unusual
number
of
adverse
reactions
to
this
particular
lot.
