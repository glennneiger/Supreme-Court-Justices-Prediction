anthony

in
--
in
this
case,
do
you
think
the
law
is
content-neutral
within
its
own
universe,
which
applies
just
to
political
speech,
so
it's
not
content-neutral
in
that
sense?
but
within
the
scheme
that
it
sets
up,
is
it
content-neutral?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
--
i'm
still
trying
to
think
about
--
suppose
there
is
one
candidate
for
the
--
for
the
pink
party,
and
then
three
candidates
for
the
orange
party,
and
all
three
candidates
for
the
orange
party
received
the
lump
sum
justice
ginsburg
was
talking
about.
but
there's
only
one
candidate
on
the
other
side,
and
he
has
to
face,
or
she
has
to
face,
three.
is
that
constitutional?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
person
is
on
one
side;
three
people
are
on
the
other
side.
and
under
the
arizona
law,
if
the
three
people
on
the
other
side
are
all
participating
candidates,
each
of
them
gets
a
bonus
if
there's
only
one
person
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
non-participating
candidate,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
$10,000
by
the
non-participating
candidate
triggers
off
$30,000
against
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
in
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical,
wouldn't
you
have
the
same
problem
in
different
terms,
in
that
one
candidate
faces
three
people,
all
of
whom
are
funded
by
the
--
by
the
government?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
just
asking
as
a
theoretical
matter
whether
there
would
be
a
constitutional
problem
in
the
case
that
i
put
under
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
fair
characterization
of
this
law
to
say
that
its
purpose
and
its
effect
are
to
produce
less
speech
in
political
campaigns?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
that
one
reason
for
people
to
decline
participation
in
the
program
is
because
they
do
not
want
to
deter
independent
expenditures?
and
let
me
--
we'll
talk
about
independent
expenditures
for
just
a
few
minutes
if
you
don't
mind.
you
indicated
independent
expenditure
has
gone
up.
i
thought
there
was
some
data
in
the
record
that
showed
the
population
has
gone
up
and
so
there's
an
argument
about
that.
but
just
as
a
common
sense
matter,
if
i'm
someone
with
the
capacity
and
the
will
to
make
an
independent
expenditure,
why
don't
i
think
twice
if
this
is
going
to
generate
an
equal
amount
on
the
other
side,
which
might
be
better
spent.
sometimes
an
independent
expenditure
is
not
really
that
effective,
it's
in
a
bad
market,
it's
a
bad
message.
but
this
results
in
cash
to
the
participating
candidate,
who
then
can
use
it
in
the
most
effective
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
of
which
is
designed
to
probe
this
idea
that
this
somehow
does
not
deter
independent
expenditures.
i
frankly
am
tempted
to
believe
the
opposite
view,
so
you
can
tell
me
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
anything
that
has
to
be
disclosed
can
also
be
prohibited?
i
mean,
i
just
don't
see
the
equivalence
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
this
law
has
a
severe
criticisms
leveled
at
it,
severe
legal
invalidities
alleged,
quite
without
reference
to
disclosure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
your
hypothetical
of
the
--
of
--
of
a
participating
candidate
who
spends
up
to
the
limit,
what
happens
if
independent
expenditures
are
then
made
on
his
behalf?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
--
there's
--
there's
two
participants
--
there's
two
candidates,
one
who's
a
participating
and
one
who's
not.
the
participating
candidate
spends
up
to
his
limit,
he
can't
spend
any
more
money.
but
then
he
gets
a
lot
of
additional
support
from
independent
groups,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
that
could
--
that
could
happen?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
--
but
the
point
that
you
made
that
the
participating
candidate
is
limited
leaves
out
the
fact
that
there
can
be
additional
expenditures
on
his
behalf
by
independent
groups?
