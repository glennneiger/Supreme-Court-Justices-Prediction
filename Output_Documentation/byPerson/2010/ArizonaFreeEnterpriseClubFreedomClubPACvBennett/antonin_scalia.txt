justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
maurer,
suppose
--
suppose
the
government
imposes
a
fine
of
$500
for
all
political
speech,
and
people
nonetheless
continue
to
engage
in
political
speech
and
pay
the
$500.
would
that
make
the
$500
penalty
for
political
speech
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
they
call
it
a
subsidy
in
davis?
i
--
if
i
recall
the
argument,
i
think
that's
what
--
what
it
was
characterized
as
there,
too.
did
they
characterize
it
as
a
penalty?
i
doubt
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
understand
the
hypothetical.
i
really
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
your
opinion
can
be
based
upon
buckley,
however.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
the
contrary
argue
here.
i'm
sure
that
in
some
of
the
public
financing
cases
that
we've
heard
argued,
it
was
asserted
that
the
purpose
was
to
level
the
playing
field,
and
that
that
was
an
entirely
valid
purpose.
i'm
unaware
that
all
public
financing
laws
have
had
as
their
purpose
simply
to
avoid
corruption.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
clear,
however.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
ask
how
it
--
how
it
combats
corruption
unless
it
suppresses
large
contributions--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
certain
entities?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
you
say,
well,
it
will
stop
big
donors
from
giving
$10
million
to
somebody's
campaign
and
having
that
person
in
his
pocket.
but
that
--
that
donor
is
still
going
to
have
that
--
that
senator
or
whoever
it
is
just
as
much
indebted
to
him
if
he
gives
$10
million,
regardless
of
whether
everybody
else
gets
$10
million
as
well.
how
does
it
--
how
does
it
combat
corruption
unless
--
unless
the
other
side
is
correct
that
its
whole
purpose
is
to
suppress
the
contribution
of
$10
million,
to
make
it
unworthwhile
for
anybody
to
give
$10
million?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
that
there's
no
evidence
that
it's
been
deterred.
is
something
true
just
because
you
say
it?
there
are
in
the
briefs
statistical
evidence
of
how
much
the
population
of
arizona
has
increased
and
how
much
less
since
the
enactment
of
this
law
the
total
expenditures
have
increased.
there
was
testimony
in
the,
in
the
district
court
from
individuals
who
said
that
they
withheld
their
contributions
because
of
this.
it's
--
it's
obvious
statistically
also
that
many
of
the
expenditures
were
made
late
in
the
game,
where
perhaps
they
were
not
as
effective,
in
order
to
be
unable
to
trigger
the
matching
funds
in
time
for
the
opposing
candidate
to
do
anything
about
it.
i
do
not
understand
how
you
can
say
that
there
is
no
evidence.
i
mean,
maybe
you
might
say
i
do
not
find
the
evidence
persuasive,
but
don't
tell
me
there's
no
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
justice
antonin
scalia
rhode
island--
justice
antonin
scalia
--has
the
same
expenditures
as
new
york
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
expect
the
two
to
have
any
relationship?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jay
--
mr.
jay,
do
you
agree
with
the
--
the
assertion
of
mr.
phillips
that
this
does
not
favor
incumbents?
i
would
have
thought
that
if
i'm
an
incumbent
with
name
recognition,
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
not
raise
any
money
and
just
--
just
take
the
public
funding,
knowing
that
if
worse
comes
to
worse
and
i
have
an
opponent
who
does
have
a
lot
of
independent
expenditures
for
him,
i'll
be
able
to
get
that
money
free
from
the
state.
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
much
pro-incumbent
rather
than
anti-incumbent.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
--
which
one
should
expect
campaign
finance
restrictions
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
answer
--
your
answer
depends
upon
whether
you
believe
that
this
scheme
will
keep
the
expenditures
down,
or
rather,
will
elevate
the
expenditures.
and
if
you
believe
that
it
will
deter
people
from
making
contributions,
it
will
keep
the
expenditures
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
anything
that,
anything
that
makes
it
more
attractive
to
take
the
public
financing
is
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what
if
--
what
if
the
state
of
arizona
says
we're
not
going
to
give
--
just
give
money
to
the
other
candidates;
we're
going
to
send
out
officers
of
arizona
to
argue
on
behalf
of
these
other
candidates?
that
would
be
clearly
banned,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
would
you
come
in
and
say,
well,
it's
perfectly
okay
because
its
purpose
is
to
make
public
funding
attractive
to
candidates?
the
mere
fact
that
it
makes
it
more
attractive
does
not
answer
the
question
whether
it's
constitutional.
