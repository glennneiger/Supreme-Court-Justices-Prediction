justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
--
can
you
tell
me
on
that,
because
i
take
it
you
agree
with
justice
ginsburg
about
buckley.
in
buckley
the
court
says,
public
financing
is
a
means
of
eliminating
the
improper
influence
of
large
private
corporations,
furthers
a
significant
government
interest.
we
both
agree
that's
what
it
says?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
that's
what
it
means.
all
right.
now,
your
objection
is
how
much
do
they
pay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here
they
have
a
trigger,
not
--
not
quantitatively.
but
here
they
say
it's
okay
to
finance
a
public
candidate
publicly,
okay
to
do
that.
now,
what
we're
going
to
do
is
give
them
a
million
dollars
to
start
with,
up
to
$3
million
to
spend,
depending
on
how
much
their
opponents
spend.
now,
you
think
that's
unconstitutional?
my
question
to
you
is,
what
would
be
a
constitutional
system
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
be
helpful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
interested
in
buckley.
i'm
interested
in
your
opinion.
you
object
to
the
amount
being
paid
in
installments.
what,
in
your
opinion,
would
be
a
constitutional
system?
i
don't
need
to
repeat
my
question,
which
i
just
did,
but
i
want
that
answer,
your
answer
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
think
that
if
joe
smith
doesn't
have
much
money,
takes
public
finance
at
all,
that
that
could
discourage
some
other
people,
brown
and
johnson,
from
running?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
there's
not
--
it's
not
going
to
--
it's
not
going
to
be
a
situation
where
government
paying
a
million
dollars
to
smith
to
help
him
in
the
campaign
would
discourage
some
other
person
from
running?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
--
if
we
say,
you
can
file
a
brief
and
if
you
do,
other
people
can
file,
is
that
my
--
forget
the
briefs.
it's
too
farfetched.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
did
--
i
did
think
you
would
give
the
other
answer,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
because
i
just
don't
see
why
giving
somebody
a
million
dollars
might
not
discourage
a
--
a
poorer
candidate
from
running.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
joe,
the
guy
who
wants
it,
it's
voluntary
for
him;
but
his
opponents
can't
do
anything
about
that.
i'm
just
saying
joe
takes
the
money,
so
brown
and
smith
say:
oh
my
god,
he
has
a
million
dollars,
forget
it.
i'll
stay
home.
i
won't
run.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
say
that
just
doesn't
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
never
happens?
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
gather
that
people
who
have
looked
into
the
arizona
scheme
also
say
what
you
think
will
happen
never
happens,
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
should
we
look
at
both
instances?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
about
--
it's
a
general
question.
answer
this
if
you
wish.
don't
if
you
don't
want
to,
and
the
same
goes
for
your
opponent.
but
as
i
hear
this
argument,
what's
going
through
my
mind
is
we
are
deeply
into
the
details
of
a
very
complex
bill.
mccain-feingold
is
hundreds
of
pages,
and
we
cannot
possibly
test
each
provision
which
is
related
to
the
others
on
such
a
test
of
whether
it
equalizes
or
incentivizes
or
some
other
thing,
because
the
answer
is
normally
we
don't
know.
and
it
is
better
to
say
it's
all
illegal
than
to
subject
these
things
to
death
by
a
thousand
cuts,
because
we
don't
know
what
will
happen
when
we
start
tinkering
with
one
provision
rather
than
another.
that
thought
went
through
my
mind
as
i've
heard
this
discussion.
comment
or
not
upon
it
as
you
wish.
[laughter]
