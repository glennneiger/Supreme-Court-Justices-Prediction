mr.
maurer,
you
--
you
don't
have
any
objection,
you
wouldn't
have
any
objection,
if
arizona
trebled
the
amount
at
the
outset?
in
other
words,
there
was
a
maximum
amount,
the
so-called
matching
funds;
if
it
were
given
all
in
one
lump
and
the
publicly
funded
candidate
was
told,
give
it
back
if
you
don't
use
it,
that
would
be
okay?
justice

how
about
not
under
buckley?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
point
of
buckley
was
that
the
public
funding,
which
you
can
accept
or
reject,
the
justification
for
it
was
that
it
increased
rather
than
decreased
speech.
and
the
--
i
think
you
were
quite
right
in
recognizing
that
matching
funds,
this
court
has
said,
do
not
conflict
with
the
--
with
the
first
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader

not
matching
funds.
public
funding.
justice
ruth

public
funding.
and
so
if
it
turns
out
that
the
states
--
public
funding
isn't
being
used
because
--
because
the
limits
are
low,
and
yet
the,
the
state
wants
to
conserve
the
public
fisc.
so
instead
of
just
increasing
the
amount
at
the
outset,
it
says
the
--
the
--
the
object
is
the
same,
but
we're
economizing
by
not
giving
it
out
in
one
lump
sum,
we're
giving
it
out
in
installments.
justice

what
about
all
the
background,
there
had
been
a
number
of
scandals
in
arizona,
there
had
been
vote
buying?
i
thought
that
that
was
part
of
the
origin
of
this
law,
was
not
as
you
now
say
had
nothing
to
do
with
corruption.
i
thought
it
emerged
out
of
that,
those
startling
incidents
of
people
actually
selling
their
votes.
