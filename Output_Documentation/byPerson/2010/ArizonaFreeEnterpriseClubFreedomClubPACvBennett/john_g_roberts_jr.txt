chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-238,
arizona
free
enterprise
club's
freedom
club
pac
v.
bennett
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
maurer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
counsel,
how
--
the
supposition
that
it
results
in
more
speech,
let's
take
the
independent
expenditure
example.
you've
got
one
candidate
running
against
three
others.
there's
an
independent
expenditure
on
behalf
of
the
one
candidate.
that
means,
say
$10,000.
that
means
each
of
the
other
three
get
$10,000
of
their
own.
now,
that
might
promote
more
speech,
but
the
effect
may
well
be
for
the
independent
expenditure
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
spend
the
money,
and
so
the
other
candidates
don't
get
the
money
and
you
have
less
speech.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
would
you
--
what
would
that
evidence
look
like?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
other
than
somebody
saying
it,
i'm
just
curious
what
the
evidence
would
look
like.
you're
--
it's
--
you're
proving
a
negative.
you're
saying,
well,
this
person
didn't
do
something
because
of
this,
and
that's
pretty
hard
to
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
the
idea
is
this
is
a
way
of
encouraging
candidates
to
take
the
public
financing,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
it
encourage
more
candidates
to
do
that
if
you
doubled
the
amount
that
was
available
for
every
additional
amount
that
the
privately
financed
candidate
spends?
he
spends
$1,000
over
the
amount
and
the
publicly
financed
candidate
gets
$2,000.
a
lot
more
people
are
going
to
do
the
publicly
financing
route
if
that
were
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
kind
of
an
odd
line
to
find
in
the
first
amendment,
isn't
it?
that
you
get
a
100
percent
matching
as
opposed
to,
say,
110
percent
or
150
percent?
somewhere
in
the
first
amendment
the
line
is
drawn
on
the
amount?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
doesn't
work?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
that,
there's
a
back
and
forth
about
the
record
and
common
sense.
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
--
i
think
this
has
already
been
asked
--
if
you
knew
that
a
$10,000
expenditure
that
you
would
make
that
would
support
a
candidate
would
result
in
$30,000,
40,000,
50,000,
depending
on
how
many
opposition
candidates
there
were
available
for
them,
wouldn't
you
think
twice
about
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you're
thinking
twice
and
one
way
you're
thinking
is
not
to
do
it,
that
sounds
like
a
sufficient
burden.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
our
cases,
as
you
know,
have
drawn
a
distinction
between
expression
and
disclosure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
focus
on
persuasiveness
--
your
focus
on
persuasiveness
is
a
particular
view
of
the
political
process
that
may
not
be
applicable
in
every
case.
political
scientists
sometimes
tell
you
that
it's
not
persuasion,
but
simply
playing
to
your
base,
getting
them
more
actively
involved.
so
it's
not
the
somewhat
more
academic
view
that
people
are
going
to
sit
down
and
just
regard
which
one
is
persuasive.
is
that
a
permissible
objective
for
the
state
to
pursue,
to
value
a
particular
view
of
the
electoral
process
over
another?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
jay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
do
you
agree
that
under
our
precedents,
leveling
the
playing
field
for
candidates
is
not
a
legitimate
state
purpose?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
checked
the
citizens'
clean
elections
commission
website
this
morning,
and
it
says
that
this
act
was
passed
to,
quote,
"level
the
playing
field"
when
it
comes
to
running
for
office.
why
isn't
that
clear
evidence
that
it's
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
--
why
do
you
think
the
elections
commission
then
tells
us
its
purpose
is
to
level
the
playing
field?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
jay.
mr.
maurer,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
10-238,
arizona
free
enterprise
versus
bennett
and
the
consolidated
case
number
10-239,
mccomish
versus
bennett.
the
arizona
citizens
clean
elections
act
created
a
public
financing
system
to
fund
the
campaigns
of
candidates
for
state
office.
under
that
system,
candidates
who
choose
to
take
public
financing
are
given
a
grant
of
state
money
to
operate
their
campaigns.
if
such
a
publicly
financed
candidate
faces
a
privately
financed
candidate,
someone
who
has
declined
state
money
and
is
instead
spending
his
own
or
raising
money
through
contributions,
the
publicly
finance
candidate
can
get
more
state
money.
the
state
will
give
the
publicly
financed
candidate
roughly
one
additional
dollar
for
each
dollar
above
the
grant
amount
that
the
privately
financed
candidate
spends
on
election
speech.
matching
funds
are
also
given
to
the
publicly
financed
candidate,
again
on
a
dollar
for
dollar
basis
in
response
to
spending
on
election
speech
by
independent
groups
when
that
speech
supports
the
privately
financed
candidate,
or
opposes
the
publicly
financed
candidate.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
this
system
is
permissible
under
the
first
amendment.
now
the
answer
to
that
question
largely
follows
from
a
case
we
decided
just
three
years
ago,
davis
versus
the
federal
election
commission.
in
davis,
we
invalidated
a
provision
of
federal
law
that
permitted
the
opponent
of
a
candidate
who
spent
over
a
certain
amount
of
his
money
to
collect
--
we
permitted
the
publicly
financed
candidate
to
collect
triple
the
normal
contribution
amount.
while
the
candidate
who
spent
the
personal
funds
remains
subject
to
the
original
contribution
cap.
we
held
that
this
unconstitutionally
forced
the
candidate
and
"to
choose
between
the
first
amendment
right
to
engage
in
unfettered
political
speech
on
the
one
hand
and
subjection
to
discriminatory
fundraising
limitations
on
the
other".
we
ruled
that
this
"unprecedented
penalty"
"imposed
a
substantial
burden
on
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
right
to
use
personal
funds
for
campaign
speech."
so
in
davis,
if
you
spent
more
than
the
said
amount
of
your
own
money,
your
opponent
could
raise
higher
amounts
in
contributions.
we
held
that
that
violated
the
first
amendment
because
it
inhibited
the
free
speech
rights
of
the
candidate
whose
speech
triggered
the
benefit
to
his
opponent.
now
the
burdens
imposed
on
candidate
speech
by
the
arizona
matching
funds
are
much
more
severe
than
the
burdens
imposed
by
the
law
we
struck
down
in
davis.
the
penalty
in
davis
consisted
of
raising
the
contribution
limits
for
one
candidate,
but
that
candidate
still
had
to
go
out
and
raise
the
additional
funds.
here,
the
penalty
for
speaking
is
a
direct
and
automatic
payment
of
state
money
to
your
political
opponent
depending
on
the
specifics
of
the
election
that
issue,
matching
funds
under
the
arizona
law
can
also
create
a
multiplier
effect.
arizona
elections
often
keep
a
privately
financed
candidate
against
multiple
publicly
financed
candidates.
in
such
a
case,
every
publicly
funded
candidate
receives
the
matching
funds.
in
such
a
situation,
the
matching
funds
provision
forces
a
privately
funded
candidate
to
fight
a
political
hydra
of
sorts.
each
dollar
he
spends
generates
two
opposing
dollars
in
response
or
even
more.
and
unlike
the
law
in
davis,
all
of
these
are
to
some
extent
out
of
the
privately
financed
candidate's
hands
spending
by
independent
groups
triggers
matching
funds
that
go
directly
to
the
publicly
funded
candidate
to
use
against
the
privately
funded
opponent
even
though
that
privately
funded
candidate
had
no
control
over
the
triggering
funds
in
the
first
place.
that
is
a
substantial
advantage
for
the
publicly
funded
candidate.
matching
funds
impose
similar
burdens
on
the
independent
expenditure
groups
themselves.
the
effect
of
a
dollar
spent
on
election
speech
by
any
such
group
is
a
direct
payout
to
the
publicly
funded
candidate
the
group
opposes
spending
$1
can
result
in
the
flow
of
dollars
to
multiple
candidates.
and
in
some
ways,
the
burdens
imposed
on
independent
groups
are
more
severe
than
the
burdens
imposed
on
the
privately
financed
candidates
themselves.
independent
groups
of
course
cannot
choose
public
financing.
as
a
result,
those
groups
can
only
avoid
triggering
matching
funds
by
changing
their
message
or
choosing
not
to
speak
at
all.
presenting
independent
expenditure
groups
with
such
a
choice
--
trigger
matching
funds,
change
your
message,
or
do
not
speak
is
highly
coercive
in
contrary
to
basic
first
amendment
values.
the
candidates
and
independent
groups
that
brought
this
suit
contend
that
the
purpose
of
the
matching
funds
provision
was
to
"level
the
playing
field"
to
have
all
candidates
in
a
political
race
the
same
financial
resources.
but
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
leveling
the
playing
field
is
not
a
legitimate
government
objective.
as
we
said
in
davis,
"leveling
electoral
opportunities
means
the
state
making
and
implementing
judge
--
judges
--
judgments
about
which
strengths
should
be
permitted
to
contribute
to
the
outcome
of
an
election."
for
example,
incumbents
typically
have
an
advantage
in
campaigns.
so
how
do
you
level
the
playing
field
to
account
for
that?
leveling
the
playing
field
financially
may
make
it
harder
for
outsiders
to
challenge
incumbents,
allowing
states
to
make
these
types
of
judgments
is
a
dangerous
enterprise.
the
first
amendment
embodies
our
choice
as
a
nation
that,
when
it
comes
to
protected
political
speech,
the
guiding
principle
is
freedom
as
we
have
put
it
the
"unfettered
interchange
of
ideas"
not
whatever
the
state
may
view
as
fair.
the
state
disavows
any
interest
in
using
matching
funds
to
level
the
playing
field
even
thought
that
is
exactly
how
the
system
operates
and
even
though
the
election
commission
website
said
that
the
act
was
passed
"to
level
the
playing
field"
when
it
comes
to
running
for
office.
the
state
instead
phrases
the
purpose
of
the
law
as
being
to
combat
corruption
and
argues
that
matching
funds
are
necessary
to
attract
candidates
into
participating
in
public
financing
so
they
can
be
sure
they'll
have
enough
money.
but
this
case
is
not
about
how
much
money
the
state
can
give
the
candidates
that
it
funds.
it
is
about
awarding
extra
funds
in
direct
response
to
the
political
speech
of
an
opposing
candidate
or
an
independent
group.
the
state
says
that
matching
the
funds
it
gives
out
to
the
amount
spent
by
privately
financed
candidates,
plus
independent
groups,
is
not
leveling
the
playing
field.
but
just
an
efficient
way
of
calibrating
how
much
is
needed
to
make
public
financing
attractive.
but
we
have
clearly
held
over
and
over
again
that
"the
first
amendment
does
not
permit
the
state
to
sacrifice
speech
for
efficiency."
here,
the
state
makes
its
public
financing
system
more
attractive
and
less
expensive
to
itself
only
by
burdening
the
protected
political
speech
of
those
candidates
who
elect
to
run
for
office
without
taking
the
states
money.
our
decision
in
the
davis
case
makes
clear
that
is
not
permitted.
we
do
not
today
call
into
question
the
wisdom
of
public
financing
as
a
means
of
funding
political
candidacy.
that
is
not
our
business.
but
determining
whether
laws
governing
campaign
finance
violate
the
first
amendment
is
very
much
our
business.
the
goal
of
creating
a
viable
public
financing
scheme
can
only
be
pursued
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
arizona's
program
gives
money
to
a
candidate
in
direct
response
to
the
campaign
speech
of
an
opposing
candidate
or
an
independent
group.
the
state
does
this
when
the
opposing
candidate
has
chosen
not
to
accept
public
financing
in
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights
and
has
engaged
in
political
speech
above
a
level
set
by
the
state
again
in
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
this
goes
too
far,
arizona's
law
substantially
burdens
political
speech
and
does
not
sufficiently
justified
by
a
compelling
interest.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
kagan
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
breyer,
and
sotomayor
have
joined.
