justice

counsel,
you
keep
--
i
--
i
just
want
to
understand
exactly
what
you
claim
the
burden
is,
because
i
thought
that
what
the
circuit
and
the
courts
below
said
was
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
any
candidate
actually
didn't
speak
or
didn't
fund
raise
because
of
this
law.
there's
some
claims
to
the
contrary
in
your
briefs
before
us,
but
i've
looked
for
that
below,
and
there
doesn't
appear
to
be
any
record
of
that.
so,
i'm
going
to
start
from
that
--
that
assumption,
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
courts
below
that
any
candidate
stopped
speaking
because
of
or
stopped
collecting
money
because
of
this.
so
exactly
what
is
the
burden
otherwise?
what
are
you
claiming
the
burden
is?
the
burden
is
that
the
--
that
the
government
is
choosing
to
give
someone
else
money?

i
--
i
want
to
go,
not
rely
on
davis,
but
just
articulate
for
me,
assuming
my
hypothetical,
the
burden
is
that
you
have
to
delay
fund-raising
or
delay
expenditures
because
you're
choosing
to
do
so.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
if
you
spend
it
--
if
you
spend
it
at
the
time
you
want
to,
you
collect
it
at
the
time
you
want,
no
one's
--
the
law's
not
telling
you
not
to
do
it.
you
find
it
an
advantage
not
to
do
it,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
your
opponent
won't
speak
as
loud
and
won't
respond,
correct?
