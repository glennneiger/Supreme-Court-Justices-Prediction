mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
public
funding
of
elections
results
in
more
speech
and
more
electoral
competition
and
directly
furthers
the
government's
compelling
interest
in
combatting
real
and
apparent
corruption
in
politics.
there
was
a
suggestion
in
response,
i
believe,
to
justice
kagan's
question
that
this
law
was
not
intended
to
combat
corruption,
but
i--
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
--well,
your
honor,
it
would
result
in
more
speech
certainly
if
all
the
candidates
got
the
$10,000.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
anyone
actually
not
spending,
any
independent
group
not
spending
money
either
in
that
circumstance
or
any
other
circumstance.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
the
evidence
would
--
would
simply
look
--
plausibly,
even
just
someone
saying
that
they
didn't
spend
money
because
of
that,
although
that
would
be
not
very
hard
evidence.
but
there
isn't
even
that
sort
of
evidence
with
respect
to
independent
groups
here,
your
honor.
and
it
makes
sense,
your
honor--
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
--i
--
that's
possibly
true,
your
honor.
the
statistical
data,
however,
here
indicates
that
individual
expenditures
have
in
fact
gone
up
since
the
implementation
of
matching
funds
in
arizona.
that
obviously
doesn't
directly
address
the
three-candidate
situation,
i
acknowledge
that.
but
there's
no
evidence
that
independent
expenditures
have
been
suppressed
at
all,
your
honor.
and
i
would
--
i
think
the
question
here,
your
honor,
is--
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
--it
combats--
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
--your
honor,
arizona's
triggered
matching
funds
provision
combats
corruption
in
the
same
manner
that
public
funding
combats
corruption,
because
that
--
the
law
is
designed
to
encourage
candidates
to
accept
public
funding
because
it
offers
a
viable
public
funding
option
to
them
while
conserving
the
state's
resources.
and
public
funding
serves
the
anticorruption
rationale
in
two
fundamental
ways.
first,
it
frees
the
candidates
who
accept
public
funding
from
the
need
to
accept
potentially
corrupting
private
contributions.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
well,
your
honor,
i
think
for
the
same
reasons
i
think
that
are
implicit
in
the
buckley
court's
upholding
of
public
funding
at
the
same
time
that
the
court
upheld
contribution
limits
and
disclosure
requirements,
i
think
implicitly
therefore
holding
that
the
three
could
go
together,
serving
the
anticorruption
interests.
and
i
think
it
does
that,
first,
by,
first
by
--
first
by
freeing,
as
i
said,
freeing
the
publicly
funded
candidates
from
the
need
even
to
take
the
limited
privately
--
private
contributions
that
would
be
allowed
under
the
law,
and
which
this
court
has
never
held
there's
a
minimum
at
which
that
no
longer
conceivably
becomes
corrupting.
but
secondly,
it
--
it
combats
corruption
by
providing
for
more
candidates
running,
more
political
speech,
and
more
electoral
competition,
all
of
which
have
happened
in
arizona.
and
where
you
have
more
candidates
and
more
electoral
competition,
you
have
less
--
you
are
going
to
have
less
corruption.
the
record--
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
--yes.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
it
would
encourage
them
more,
your
honor.
it's
not
our
contention
that
anything
that
a
state
or
congress
did
to
encourage
public
funding
would
necessarily
be
constitutional.
i
think
the
question
would
be
different
if
it
were
a
two
to
one
or,
to
make
a
more
stark
contrast,
a
ten
to
one
match.
i
think
that
would
raise
multiple
questions.
one
question
would
be,
looking
at
the
statute
in
its
entirety,
has
the
public
funding
scheme
become
coercive
rather
than
voluntary?
it
would
raise
the
question
whether
the
purpose
of
the
law
were
really
to
simply
provide
viable
funding
to
candidates--
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
--i
think
somewhere
in
the
first
amendment
there
is
a
line,
your
honor,
implicit
in
buckley,
where
a
public
funding
law
provides
such
substantial
benefits
without
sufficient
countervailing
burdens
to
publicly
funded
candidates
that
it
becomes
coercive
rather
than
voluntary,
and
therefore
you
have
coerced
someone
into
accepting
a
spending
limit,
which
i
believe
would
be
certainly
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
and
almost
surely
unconstitutional.
and
i
think
that
is
--
the
court
would
need
to
assess
that
in
each
instance,
and
i
think
it
could
be
done.
i
certainly
don't
think
that
here
you
have
a
coercive
system.
a
third
of
the
candidates
don't
accept
public
funding,
and
most
of
those
who
don't
and
accept
--
and
face
publicly
funded
candidates
actually
win.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
certainly
it
doesn't
work
in
the
sense,
your
honor,
if
the
goal
were
for
everyone
to
accept
public
funding,
it
doesn't
work
in
that
sense.
but
it
certainly
works
in
the
sense
that
two-thirds
of
the
candidates
do,
and
it
works
in
the
sense
that
there
hasn't
been
a
repeat
of
the
public
corruption
scandals
in
arizona
since
the
law
was
passed.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
your
honor,
independent--
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
--well,
your
honor,
independent
expenditure
groups
--
there's
no
evidence
that
it
really
in
fact
has
been
deterred.
your
honor,
independent
expenditure
groups
essentially
have
to
take
their
candidates
as
they
find
them,
if
you
will.
there's
no
discrimination
among
someone
who
is
speaking
in
favor
of
a
privately
financed
candidate
and
one
who
is
speaking
in
favor
of
a
participating
candidate.
the
different
treatment
is
the
different
treatment
of
the
candidates.
someone
who
speaks
against
a
privately
financed
candidate
runs
the
risk
that
that
person
is
going
to
use
the
ad
against
them
to
do
all
of
the
things
that
the
public
financed
candidate
may
not
do.
he
can
raise
private
contributions,
he
can
take
money
from
his
political
party,
he
can
spend
his
own
money
and
he
can
spend
unlimited
amounts
of
money.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
maybe
i
should
say
there's
no
significant
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
but
with
respect
to
each
of
the
items
that
you
mentioned:
with
respect
to
the
population
point,
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
and
it
does
not
make
sense
that
expenditures
either
by
candidates
or
by
independent
groups
would
increase
proportionally
to
the
population
of
a
state
because
most
of
the
expenses
of
a
campaign
are
fixed
and--
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
--and
not
variable.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
no,
no,
your
honor.
of
course
not.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
of
course
not,
your
honor.
i
don't
suggest
that
there's
no
relationship
between
population
and
expenditures,
but
you
wouldn't
expect
it
to
go
up
proportionally,
which
is
what
the
argument
that
the
petitioners
make,
is
that
it
didn't
go
up
proportionally.
you
wouldn't
expect
that,
particularly
given
what
the
demographics
of
the
population
increase
have
been
in
arizona
and
elsewhere
in
the
country.
with
respect
to
the
evidence
of
individuals,
there
are
two
petitioner
independent
committees
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
arizona
taxpayers
action
committee
and
the
arizona
free
enterprise
club.
at
joint
appendix
584
is
the
testimony
of
the
first
that
they
never
withheld
money
from
a
race
because
of
matching
funds
and
can't
recall
any
contributor
to
them
doing
so.
and
the
arizona
free
enterprise
club
at
joint
appendix
666
and
670,
the
treasurer
testified
that
matching
funds
never
caused
them
not
to
make
a
contribution
and
that
the
pac
to
which
they
contribute
at
ja
670
didn't
recall
making
a
decision
not
to
spend
money
because
of
matching
funds
with
respect
to--
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
--i
might
think
twice
about
it,
your
honor.
but
first,
i
think
thinking
twice
is
not
a
severe
burden.
i
think
i
might
think
twice
in
some
circumstances
if
i
knew
that
by
spending
a
certain
amount
of
money
i
had
to
disclose
the
fact
that
i
was
doing
that
and
what
my
political
views
were
and
lose
my
anonymity,
but
thinking
twice
this
court
has
held
in
that
circumstance
doesn't
create
a
severe
burden,
and
we
would
submit
that
thinking
twice
here
similarly
does
not.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
well,
your
honor,
if
it
were
a
sufficient
burden,
it
would
presumably
have
been
a
sufficient
burden
with
respect
to
disclosure,
where
this
court
has
recognized
that
some
people
may
not
spend
or
contribute
because
of
the
disclosure
requirements.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
disclosure,
this
court
has
recognized,
potentially
chills,
deters
the
expression
itself.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
no,
your
honor,
i
wasn't
suggesting
that.
but
i--
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
--well,
your
honor,
i
was
making
the
analogy
to
disclosure
in
the
sense
of
the
think-twice
notion
that
mr.
chief
justice
raised,
but
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
this
creates
any
more
of
a
burden,
indeed
we
would
submit
less
of
a
burden,
than
a
disclosure
requirement.
you
would
expect
somebody
who
believes
that
their
speech
is
more
persuasive
than
the
other
participants
in
the
race,
whether
they
be
an
independent
group
or
a
candidate,
to
choose
more
speech,
because
they
think
that,
if
i
speak,
even
if
the
other
people
speak,
my
message
is
going
to
get
out
there
and
it's
going
to
be
preferable.
there
may
be
some
few
candidates,
although
there's
not
a
record
of
that
here,
some
few
groups
or
candidates
who
would
decide
that
they
would
prefer
less
speech.
it's
better
for
me
if
my
opponent
or
the
other
candidate
doesn't
speak
more
because
he's
going
to
be
more
persuasive
than
i
am.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
state
is
doing
that.
what
i'm
addressing
is
the
effect
of
the
law,
and
i
think
your
honor
makes
a
good
point,
which
is
that
they
assume,
petitioners
assume,
that
essentially
this
is
a
zero-sum
game
and
that
because
if
i
spend
$10,000
the
other
guy
is
going
to
get
$10,000
to
respond,
that
somehow
that's
a
wash.
well,
it's
not
a
wash,
first,
because
i
think
my
speech
is
more
persuasive
so
i'm
going
to
do
it
anyway,
because
i'd
rather
get
it
out
there;
and
secondly,
because
i
may
be
spending
my
$10,000
on
getting
out
my
voters,
and
i
need
to
do
that
regardless.
and
that's
why
you
don't
see
in
the
statistics
any
evidence
that
this
actually
suppresses
speech.
and
as
i
said,
there
may
be
some
few
candidates
who
would
opt
for
less
speech
because
it's
strategically
better
for
them,
but
we
would
submit
that
that--
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
it
proves
is
that
you
--
the
key
point
in
here
is
that
initial
choice
that
is
voluntarily
made
by
each
of
the
candidates,
whether
the
system
of
public
financing
under
which
you
may
receive
matching
funds
is
better
for
them
or
whether
the
system--
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
--because,
your
honor,
the
discrimination,
if
you
want
to
--
if
you
call
it
discrimination
or
different
treatment,
is
based
on
the
initial
choices
of
the
candidates
as
to
how
they're
going
to
finance
their
campaigns.
it's
not
based
on
the
content
of
the
speech.
there's
--
matching
funds
do
not
turn
in
any
way
on
the
ideas
or
the
messages
or
the
viewpoints
or
the
subject
matter
of
the
candidate
or
the
independent
group's
speech
or
on
the
identity
of
the
speaker.
it
turns
entirely
on
what
choice
the
candidate
made
at
the
outset.
and
it
is
analogous,
in
a
sense,
your
honor,
to
the
situation
that's
faced
by
a
contributor
who
is
deciding
whether
to
contribute,
for
example,
to
a
501(c)(3)
or
a
501(c)(4)
organization.
if
they
contribute
to
the
organization
that
can
lobby,
they
don't
get
a
tax
deduction.
mr.
bradley
s.
phillips
and
--
and,
your
honor,
two
points.
you're
free,
of
course,
to
run
an
ad
that
addresses
the
issue
without
expressly
advocating
for
or
against
any
candidate
without
triggering
matching
funds.
and
secondly,
the
candidates
made
a
choice,
and
if
you're
the
person
who
is
--
who
supports
the
participating
candidate,
you
can't
make
a
contribution
to
that
candidate,
while
you
could
to
the
other
candidate
because
of
the
choice
that
was
made.
and
you
can
be
responded
to,
if
you
run
an
ad
criticizing
the
non-participating
candidate,
you
can
be
responded
to
with
unlimited
amounts
of
money
from
--
taken
from
a
political
party,
the
person's
own
money,
whereas,
too,
if
you
attack
a
privately
financed
candidate,
you
would
only
be
subject
to
being
potentially
responded
to
with
limited
matching
funds.
and
it
all
flows
from
the
voluntary
choice
that
is
made
at
the
outset
by
the
candidates
about
which
system
of
financing
is
better
for
them.
and
this
is
a
system,
the
matching
funds
system,
is
a
mechanism
that
the
state
uses
in
order
to
be
able
to
offer
viable
public
funding
to
candidates
without
wasting
public
resources,
and
both
the
logic
and
evidence
demonstrates
that
it
is,
in
fact,
effective,
both
at
promoting
speech
by
encouraging
candidates
to
run
and,
indeed,
particularly
resulting
in
more
competitive
races
for
incumbents
--
against
incumbents
in
arizona
and
promoting
speech.
and
i
would
just
like
briefly
to
address
justice
alito's
question
about
the
ex
ante
measurement
of
the
funds.
now,
of
course,
we
would
submit
that
it's
not
relevant
because
we're
not
in
--
should
not
be
in
strict
scrutiny
and
therefore
don't
need
to
show
this
is
the
least
restrictive
means,
your
honor.
but,
justice
alito,
an
ex
ante
system
would
run
substantial
risks
of
underfunding
or
overfunding
races,
and
in
particular
--
and
therefore
wouldn't
serve
the
state's
interest
in
saving
money
or
in
properly
measuring
--
but,
in
particular,
would
run
the
risk
of
having
an
incumbent
who
might
have
been
in
office
for
several
terms
unopposed
and
not
having
spent
any
money
in
those
races,
and
now
you
are
measuring
how
much
his
possibly
now
viable
challenger
will
get
in
public
funding
based
upon
some
minuscule
amount
of
money
that
the
incumbent
has
needed
to
spend.
so
i
think
that
that
would
not
serve
the
state's
interests
in
ensuring
the
candidates
actually
have
viable
public
funding.
and
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
