mr.
william
r.
maurer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
whether
the
government
may
insert
itself
into
elections
and
manipulate
campaign
spending
to
favor
its
preferred
candidates.
arizona
does
this
in
a
manner
that
is
even
more
burdensome
to
free
speech
than
the
law
at
issue
in
davis
v.
fec.
arizona
burdens
the
law
of
three
groups
that
pose
no
threat
of
corruption
under
this
court's
precedents:
independent
expenditure
groups,
self-financed
candidates,
and
candidates
who
raise
private
funds
under
one
of
the
lowest
contribution
limits
in
the
nation.
under
davis
v.
fec
and
this
court's
well-established
precedents,
the
matching
funds
provision
is
unconstitutional
and
should
be
struck
down.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
that
would
be
constitutional
under
davis,
your
honor.
this
case
is
not
about
whether
the
state
of
arizona
may
provide
campaign
financing
using
public
funds,
nor
is
it
about
whether
--
the
ability
of
arizona
to
ensure
that
those
who
receive
the
public
funds
can
run
effective
campaigns.
what
this
case
is
about
is
whether
the
government
can
turn
my
act
of
speaking
into
the
vehicle
by
which
my
political
opponents
benefit
with
direct
government
subsidies.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
your
honor,
in
davis
this
court
recognized
that
a
trigger
like
this,
a
--
the
law
that
turns
the
choice
of
--
my
choice
to
speak
effectively
into
fundraising
advantages
for
my
opponents
constitutes
a
substantial
burden.
so
even
if
candidates
continue
to
speak,
the
law
constitutes
a
substantial
burden
on
their
speech.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
well,
your
--
your
honor,
this
court
in
davis
recognized
that
when
the
government
reaches
into
a
campaign
and
attempts
to
manipulate
campaign
financing
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
basically
effectuate
the
outcome,
that
constitutes
a
--
an
illegitimate
governmental
purpose.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
i
would
disagree
with
that,
respectfully,
your
honor.
there
is
a
restriction
here.
every
time
an
independent
expenditure
group
or
a
privately
financed
candidate
speaks
above
a
certain
amount,
the
government
creates
real
penalties
for
them
to
have
engaged
in
unfettered
political
expression.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
your
honor,
in
davis,
this
court
recognized
that
in
the
context
of
competitive
elections,
which
are
a
zero-sum
game,
what
benefits
one
candidate
will
burden,
necessarily,
or
harm
the
other
candidate.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
in
fact,
it
was
not
a
subsidy
in
davis,
your
honor.
the
--
the
effect
of
this
law
is
considerably
harsher
than
the
law
at
issue
in
davis.
in
davis,
the
non-millionaires'
candidate
still
had
to
go
out
and
actually
raise
the
funds
that
the
millionaires'
amendment
permitted
him
to
raise.
in
this
case,
the
law
provides
direct
government
subsidies,
based
on
my
act
of
speaking,
to
my
political
opponents.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
well,
your
honor,
the
--
i
would
point
out
that
independent
expenditure
groups
do
not
have
that
choice
of
participating
in
the
subsidy
or
not.
so
to
the
extent
that
davis
relied
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
treatment
of
speakers
in
the
same
race,
this
case
--
this
law
replicates
and
actually
exacerbates
the
harm
that
was
at
issue
in
davis.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
i
represent
two
independent
expenditure
groups.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
this
is
a
facial
and
as-applied
challenge,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
because
the
only
thing
that
will
trigger
matching
funds,
particularly
for
independent
expenditure
groups,
is
the
content
of
the
message.
if
an
independent
expenditure
group
speaks
in
favor
of
a
privately
financed
candidate,
they
will
not
trigger
matching
funds.
if
they
speak
against
a
publicly
financed
candidate,
they
will
trigger
matching
funds.
that
not
is
only
content-based;
it
is
also
a
rejection
of
the
standard
this
court
enunciated
in
citizens
united
that
the
government
cannot
make
distinguishing
burdens
on
the
basis
of
an
identity
of
a
speaker.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
it
would
not
be
--
i'm
sorry.
it
would
be
constitutional
under
davis.
and
i
--
and
i
think
that
the
point,
your
honor,
is
reflected--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--yes,
that's
absolutely
true.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
well,
this
case
is
not
challenging
a
public
financing
system,
and--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--not
under
davis,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
there
may
be
--
there
may
be
instances
where
a
public
financing
law
is
so
lopsided
that
it
creates
a
coercive
effect,
and
buckley
was
quite
clear
that
one
of
the
things
that
was
acceptable
about
the
public
financing
system
at
issue
in
that
case
was
that
it
was
voluntary.
but
in
this
case,
we're
dealing
with
a
very
different
type
of
first
amendment
harm.
the
trigger
matters,
your
honors.
it
is,
in
fact,
determinative.
it
is
exactly
the
same
kind
of
trigger--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--your
honor,
if
i
--
if
i
had
said
that,
i
was
mistaken.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
oh,
okay.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
your
honor,
in
riley
v.
national
federation
of
the
blind,
this
court
recognized
that
--
that
the
government
cannot
sacrifice
speech
for
efficiency,
and
what
--
if
--
if
we
accept
the
holding
of
davis
v.
fec
and
accept
that
that
is
still
a
holding
that
is
viable
under
the
first
amendment,
then
what
the
--
the
position
of
the
respondents
is,
is
that
they,
in
fact,
can
sacrifice
free
speech
in
order
to
be
more
efficient,
but--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--yes,
that's
what
buckley
says,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
no.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
your
honor--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--your
honor,
in
buckley
this
court
recognized--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--yes,
the
presidential
financing
system
is
constitutional,
your
honor.
and
i
would
also
--
i
would
also
respectfully
disagree
with
your
characterization
that
the
--
the
nature
of
our
objection
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
our
opponents
are
receiving
money.
the
problem
here
is
not
that
our
--
the
opponents
of
my
clients
are
receiving
money.
it's
what
triggers
that,
and
what
triggers
that
is
my
exercise
of
my
free
speech
rights.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
that
would
be
a
constitutional
system,
your
honor.
there
is
no
constitutional
objection
or
at
least
we're
not
raising
any
constitutional
objection
to
the
idea
that
there
is
a
--
that
public
financing
means
that
people
can't
run
effective
races.
you
can
have
a
public
financing
system
with
sufficient
funds
to
run
an
effective
race.
but
what
you
cannot
do
is
exactly
what
arizona
has
done,
which
is
turn
my
act
of
speaking
into
the
vehicle
by
which
my
political
opponents
benefit.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
your
honor,
one
of
the
things
that
would
distinguish
that
is
that
it
--
justice
alito's
hypothetical
completely
divorces
the
amount
of
the
grant
from
my
political
activity
or
the
political
activity
of
people
who
don't
want
to
or
cannot
take
public
funds
in
arizona.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
your
honor,
i
believe
the
distinction
would
lie
in
the
fact
that
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
not
to
provide
necessarily
the
ability
of
candidates
to
run
effective
publicly
financed
campaigns.
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
limit
spending
in
elections
and
to
level
the
playing
field.
justice
alito's
hypothetical--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
that
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
prevent
corruption,
and
i
would
like
to
read
from
the
executive
director
of
the
clean
elections
commission
who
said
that:
"it
cannot
be
disputed
that
the
purpose
of
the
clean
elections
act
is
to
equalize
the
playing
field
and
to
give
participating
candidates
equal
opportunity
to
get
their
message
out.
"
which
is
at
joint
appendix
236.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
well,
that
is
the
basis
of
public
financing
systems
in
general,
but
this
system
does
not
actually
address
that
because
this
court--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--your
honor,
it
--
when
this
law
was
promoted,
when
it
was
drafted,
when
it
was
propagated
and
--
and
--
and
campaigned
about
to
the
people
of
the
state
of
arizona,
it
was
presented
as
doing
two
things:
leveling
the
playing
field
and
limiting
spending
in
campaigns.
it
wasn't
until
this
court's
decision
in
--
in
davis
that
the
state
of
arizona
suddenly
discovered
that
the
purpose
of
the
law
was
actually
to
fight
corruption
or
the
primary
purpose
was
to
actually
fight
corruption.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
well,
they
were
selling
their
votes
for
outright
bribes,
your
honor.
they
weren't
selling
them
for
campaign
contributions.
and
if
this
law
was
aimed
at
the
single
narrow
exception
that
this
court
recognized
to
the
--
to
the
general
principle
that
restrictions
on
political
activity
violate
the
first
amendment,
then
they
would
not
have
structured
this
law
in
the
way
that
they
did,
which
is
to
burden
the
speech
of
three
political
speakers
that
pose
no
threat
of
corruption
under
this
court's
precedents.
it's--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--no,
your
honor.
first,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
the
ninth
circuit
of
the
evidence
produced
at
the
district
court.
there
was
considerable
evidence
of
people
not
making
expenditures,
of
slowing
their
fund-raising,
as
--
as
one
of
my
clients
put
it,
to
a
crawl
in
order
to
avoid
triggering
matching
funds.
but
even
if
that
were
relevant,
the
--
or
even
if
that
--
that
material
did
not
exist,
in
davis
this
court
recognized
that
the
inherent
structure
of
the
act
constitutes
a
substantial
burden
on
speech
because
it
presents
the
choice
of
having
to
either
engage--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--we
are
not
choosing
to
do
so.
we're
--
we
are
being
coerced
into
do
--
doing
so
by
the
government.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
no.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
i
--
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
what
the
harm
in
delaying
your
speech
is
that
in
order
to
minimize
the
--
the
triggering
of
substantial,
and
i
would
--
i
would
also
add
unfair
benefits
to
a
publicly
financed
candidate
based
on
one's
act
of
unfettered
political
expression,
candidates
and
independent
expenditure
groups
all
testified,
all
the
petitioners
testified
that
they
delayed
speaking
in
order
to
minimize
the
effect
of
matching
funds,
and
the--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--all
thing
--
all
else
things
being
equal,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
it
certainly
would,
your
honor;
and
under
arizona's
system,
if
you
applied
arizona's
system
to
this
hypothetical,
not
only
would
mr.
phillips
be
able
to
file
an
additional
brief,
but
the
state
of
arizona
would
be
able
to
file
an
additional
brief,
and
the
solicitor
general's
office
would
be
able
to
file
an
additional
brief,
and
anyone
who
weighed
in
on
the
other
side
would
be
able
to
file
an
additional
brief.
that's
the
very
nature
of
this
law,
in
that
it
creates
--
it
is
entirely
structured
to
create
disincentives,
as
the
proponents
of
this
act
were
quite
clear,
it
was
to
create
disincentives
on
people
speaking
or
engaging
in
political
activity
more
than
the
government
preferred.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
i
believe
that
that
is
a
--
a
goal,
and
i
believe
that's
the
effect.
the
entire
--
the
entire
motivation
of
this
law
was
to
limit
the
--
limit
spending
in
leveling
the
playing
field.
limiting
spending
indicates
that
they
wanted
less
political
speech
in
the
state
of
arizona,
and
that's
what
they've
got.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
it
--
it's
not--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--well,
your
honor,
the
courts
that
have
looked
at
public
financing
systems,
including
the
buckley
court,
noticed
or
were
made
clear
that
one
of
the
things
that
constitutes
a
constitutional
public
financing
system
is
its
voluntariness.
at
certain
margins--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--well--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--i--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--i--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--your
--
your
honor--
mr.
william
r.
maurer
--your
honor,
it's
not
the
question
of
people
being
dissuaded
from
running
because
their
opponent
may
be
able
to
mount
an
effective
campaign.
the
issue
is
the
government
turning
my
speech
into
the
vehicle
by
which
my
entire
political
message
is
undercut.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
regard
to
the
record
evidence
of
an
actual
chill,
i
would
note
that
the
record
--
if
this
court
takes
the
opportunity,
as
it's
obliged
to
do
under
the
bose
corp.
decision
to
look
at
the
entire
record,
the
evidence
is
replete
with
examples
of
people
not
making
expenditures
such
as
tony
bouie,
who
refrained
from
sending
out
mailers,
making
auto
calls
or
distributing
information,
john
mccomish
also
had
a
similar
response,
the
arizona
taxpayers
action
committee
did
not
engage
in
a
particular
campaign
because
it
would
have
triggered
matching
funds.
but
ultimately
when
we
get
right
down
to
it,
though,
the
question
is
does
this
create
the
same
kind
of
burden
in
--
as
--
as
in
davis,
and
i
could
go
through
point
by
point,
mr.
phillips,
and
mr.
jay's
argument,
but
they're
all
answered
by
davis.
davis
recognized
that
this
type
of
interference
with
the
--
with
the
voters'
decision
as
to
who
to
elect
to
office
and
the
purpose
of
doing
that
in
order
to
raise
the
voices
of
those
the
government
thinks
is
speaking
too
little
and
muffle
the
voices
of
those
the
government
think
is
speaking
too
much
is
completely
illegitimate.
this
case
is
determined
by
davis.
for
instance,
the
--
the
argument
that
mr.
phillips
made
that
speech
has
gone
up
in
--
in
arizona
is
--
is
undone
by
davis,
which
recognizes
that
increases
in
the
aggregate
of
speech
cannot
justify
restrictions
on
individual
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
i
think
what
this
court
was
recognizing
in
davis
is
that
when
the
--
when
the
government
relaxes
restrictions
on
free
speech,
when
there's
more
freedom,
that
doesn't
constitute
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
that's
not
what
the
government
is
doing
here.
it's
effectuating
its
goal
of
limiting
spending
in
leveling
the
playing
field
by
burdening
and
disincentivizing
people
to
engage
in
their
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
william
r.
maurer
it
would
not
have
the
unfair
trigger
that
this
system
has.
the
entire
argument
here
is
not
that
--
that
our
clients
have
a
concern
with
too
much
speech.
our
concern
is
that
their
speech
is
turning
into
the
mechanism
by
which
their
political
goals
are
undercut.
so
each
time
they
speak,
the
more
work
that
they
do,
the
more
their
opponents
benefit.
that
is
--
that
on
its
face
creates
a
--
a
--
a
common
sense
disincentive
to
engage
in
more
and
more
political
activity.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i'll
thank
the
court
for
its
time.
