mr.
william
m.
jay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin,
if
i
may,
with
justice
alito's
question
to
mr.
phillips
about
whether
the
independent
expenditure
aspect
of
this
statute
is
content-neutral,
and
i
think
that,
looking
at
this
in
the
context
of
a
multi-candidate
race,
which
most
races
in
arizona
are,
is
important
to
set
the
context,
because
most
races
in
arizona
are
not
one
candidate
against
another
candidate.
every
house
district
in
arizona
has
two
--
has
two
members,
so
every
general
election
has
at
least
four
candidates.
and
it
simply
is
not
the
case
that
running
an
ad
in
support
of
a
publicly
financed
candidate
does
not
trigger
matching
funds.
it
depends
not
on
what
the
ad
says,
not
even
on
who
the
candidate
is
being
supported,
but
on
whether
another
candidate
in
the
race
takes
public
financing.
so
money
spent
to
support
one
publicly
financed
candidate
may
trigger
matching
funds
to
another.
that's
not
a
content
discrimination.
mr.
william
m.
jay
oh,
justice
scalia--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--justice
scalia,
i'm
happy
to
--
to
endorse
the
sentiment,
because
i
think
that
the
petitioners'
evidence
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
who
were
incumbent
office
holders
and
say
that
they
did
not
spend
money
because
they
were
--
they
feared
the
response
that
would
be
paid
for
by
matching
funds,
i
think
their
own
evidence,
including
the
declaration
that
they
put
in
at
joint
appendix
364,
says:
if
i
can
keep
the
spending
down,
me
as
an
incumbent,
i
have
a
tremendous
advantage.
that's
an
arizona
legislator
talking
to
one
of
the
--
talking
to
the
--
to
one
of
their
experts.
and
that's
because
--
and
a
race
that
features
low
dollar
amounts
on
both
sides
often
advantages
an
incumbent.
and
that
is
the
purpose
--
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
matching
funds
provision,
to
allow
--
to
allow
challengers
to
be
competitively
funded.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
initial
grant.
the
reason
that--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--it's
not
--
it's
not
a
matter
of
deterring
people
from
making
contributions,
justice
scalia.
when
there
are
competitive
races,
the
matching
funds
provision
provides
a
formula
for
giving
the
publicly
funded
candidate
as
much
money
as
the
private
--
as
the
privately
funded
candidate
that
they're
competing
with.
and
in
most
cases
the
incentives
on
both
sides
are
for
more
speech,
for
both
sides
to
get
out
their
message,
run
their
ads,
and
persuade
the
voters.
in
some
cases
--
and
we
submit
that
the
anecdotal
evidence
the
petitioners
have
submitted
touches
on
these
cases
--
the
privately
funded
candidate
may
have
an
incentive
to
keep
spending
down,
but
we
don't
think
that's
true
systemically
under
this
system.
we
think
that
the
--
that
the
public
financing
in
general
and
the
matching
funds
provision
in
particular
facilitates
speech,
because
the
only
consequence
of
running
an
independent
expenditure,
for
example,
at
most,
the
consequence
is
that
another
party
will
get
to
run
a
responsive
ad,
and
the
sum
of
speech
will
be
increased.
mr.
william
m.
jay
we
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
--
that,
of
course,
is
not
what's
at
work
here.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
whatever
the
citizens
clean
elections
commission
says
on
its
web
site
i
think
isn't
dispositive
of
what
the
voters
of
arizona
had
in
mind
when
they
passed
this
initiative.
the
court
--
this
court
has
recognized
since
buckley
that
public
financing
serves
a
valid
anticorruption
purpose,
and
it
does
so
because
it
eliminates
the
influence
of
private
contributions
on
the
candidates
who
take
public
financing.
and
it--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
justice
alito,
the
matching
funds
provision
the
state
of
arizona
has
concluded
is
an
important
way
of
ensuring
that
candidates
will
take
public
financing,
because
it
is
a
formula
of
ensuring
that
candidates
will
have
enough
money
to
run
competitive
races
without
wasting
the
state's
money
by
--
by--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
--
i
will
comment
in
this
way,
justice
breyer.
i
think
that
it's
remarkable
--
i
appreciate
the
opportunity,
and
i
will
take
it.
the
parties
in
this
case
agree
that
public
financing
is
itself
not
objectionable.
the
parties
in
this
case
agree
that
even
a
large
government
grant
at
the
outset
which
could
be
used
to
fund
responsive
ads
to
a
--
to
a
privately
financed
candidate
or
to
independent
expenditures,
that's
not
problematic.
mr.
william
m.
jay
that's
not
our
position.
mr.
william
m.
jay
yes--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--it
doesn't
make
--
it
doesn't
just
make
it
more
attractive,
justice
scalia.
it
allows
publicly-funded
candidates
to
run
on
the
same
footing
as
privately-funded
candidates,
because
they
can
spend
comparable
amounts.
that
is
the
point
that
we're
making,
not
that
any
--
not
that
any
incentive
the
state
could
dream
up
would
be
constitutional.
but
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
--
that
there
are
incentives
and
disincentives
on
both
sides,
i
think
doesn't
suffice
to
answer
the
question.
the
fact,
as
mr.
phillips
pointed
out,
there
may
be
disincentives
to
engage
in
speech
when
a
disclosure
requirement
takes
effect.
anyone
who
wishes
to
run
an
independent
expenditure
under
the
system
upheld
in
buckley,
anyone
who
had
spent
over
$100
had
to
disclose.
and
the
court
recognized
in
buckley
that
it
was
undeniably
the
case
that
public
disclosure
would
deter
some
individuals.
the
court
nonetheless
didn't
apply
strict
scrutiny
because
that
is
not
the
kind
of
severe
burden
that
the
first
amendment
recognizes.
the
court--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--the
same
dollar
amount
footing,
justice
alito.
but
there's
a--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--far
different
mix
of
benefits
and
burdens--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--it's
not,
justice
alito,
because
there
is
a
far
different
mix
of
benefits
and
burdens
that
a
publicly-financed
candidate
takes.
there
is
an
absolute
cap
--
under
this
matching
funds
provision,
there
is
an
absolute
cap
above
which
a
publicly-financed
candidate
cannot
spend,
no
matter
what.
once
a
publicly-financed
candidate
reaches
that
cap,
which
they've
agreed
to
as
a
condition
of
taking
public
financing,
independent
groups
and
their
opponents
can
--
can
raise
more
money,
can
run
more
ads
against
them,
completely
without
limit,
and
you
--
you
have
to
take
that
into
consideration
when
you're
considering
what
incentives
and
what
deterrent
effect
the
matching
funds
provision
is
having.
publicly-funded
candidates
accept
certain
limits,
and
one
of
those
limits
is
an
absolute
limit
on
spending.
the
matching
funds
provision
simply
adjusts
that
limit
based
on
how
much
is
being
spent
in
that
race.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
can't
--
i
--
i
don't
speak
for
the
elections
commission,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
state
of
arizona
has
said
in
--
in
this
case
that
the
purpose
of
public
financing,
as
indeed
was
the
purpose
of
the
presidential
public
financing
system
that
this
court
upheld
in
buckley,
is
to
combat
corruption.
and
public
financing
is
a
recognized
way
of
combatting
corruption,
and
giving
out
these
matching
funds
is
a
way
of
encouraging
candidates
to
participate.
mr.
william
m.
jay
independent
expenditures
on
his
behalf
don't
--
would
trigger
public
matching
funds
to
any
other
matching--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--to
any
other
candidate
in
the
race.
mr.
william
m.
jay
in
a
two-person
race,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--it
could.
and
the
privately
financed
candidate,
unlike
the
publicly
financed
candidate
who
is
the
target
of
independent
expenditures,
is
free
to
raise
more
money
and
use
that
--
use
those
additional
funds
to
respond.
mr.
william
m.
jay
there
can
be
--
may
i
finish
the
sentence?
there
can
be,
but
a
candidate
deciding
whether
to
participate
by
definition
doesn't
know
in
advance
whether
there
will
be
independent
expenditures
on
his
behalf,
and
the
matching
funds
provision
allows
that
candidate
to
know
when
he
elects
public
financing
that
he
will
have
enough
money
to
compete.
