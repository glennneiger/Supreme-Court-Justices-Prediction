justice
elena
kagan
could
i
try
to
understand
that
argument
a
little
bit
better,
mr.
maurer?
suppose
--
and
i
know
that
you
think
this
is
not
the
case,
but
just
bear
with
the
hypothetical.
suppose
that
there
were,
in
fact,
no
deterrent
effect
on
your
speech
or
on
the
speech
of
any
candidate;
in
other
words,
that
people
thought,
well,
you
know,
i
would
rather
be
--
have
me
be
the
only
person
who
talks,
but
--
but
i
would
rather
talk
than
be
silent,
even
if
it
means
my
opponent
can
talk,
too,
so
that
there's
no
deterrent
effect
from
this
law
whatsoever.
would
there
still
be
a
constitutional
objection?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it
constitutes
a
substantial
burden,
so
even
if
every
single
person
makes
a
choice,
yes,
i
want
to
continue
to
speak,
it
does
not
chill
any
speak
--
any
speech.
i
suppose
i'm
not
sure
what
it
means
to
constitute
a
substantial
burden
if,
in
fact,
the
law
does
not
chill
speech.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
in
fact,
there's
no
such
restriction
here,
is
there,
mr.
maurer?
there's
no
restriction
at
all
here;
it's
more
speech
all
the
way
around?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
doesn't
the
government
actually
just
give
a
selective
subsidy?
it's
not
a
penalty,
it's
just
saying,
in
order
to
--
to
run
an
effective
public
financing
system,
when
you
speak,
we're
going
to
give
a
subsidy
over
a
certain
amount.
so
the
trigger
does
not
trigger
a
penalty;
it
triggers
a
subsidy.
justice
elena
kagan
there
is,
though,
a
significant
difference
between
davis
and
this
case.
what
the
expenditure
triggered
in
davis
was
a
discriminatory
restriction
that
would
never
be
allowed
in
and
of
itself.
what
the
law
triggers
here
is
something
that,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
the
government
could
do
from
the
get-go,
which
is
subsidize
the
speech
of
a
candidate
who
decides
to
participate
in
a
public
financing
system.
justice
elena
kagan
but
there's
no
particular
as-applied
challenge
from
independent
speakers
in
this
lawsuit,
is
there?
justice
elena
kagan
my
--
my
understanding
was
that
the
suit
was
brought
as
a
facial
challenge
to
the
entire
law.
justice
elena
kagan
but
that's
interesting,
mr.
maurer,
because
i
don't
see
all
that
much
of
a
difference
between
justice
alito's
hypothetical
and
the
facts
here.
in
other
words,
you
said
that
justice
alito's
hypothetical
would
be
constitutional,
even
though
under
justice
alito's
hypothetical
the
state
is
trying
to
figure
out
how
much
money
it
takes
to
run
a
competitive
race
and
giving
people
who
enter
the
public
financing
system
that
amount
of
money.
that's
exactly
what
the
state
is
doing
here,
but
it's
doing
it
in
actually
a
more
accurate
way.
so
if
justice
alito's
hypothetical
is
constitutional,
why
isn't
this?
they're
both
trying
to
do
the
same
thing,
which
is
to
put
sufficient
money
in
the
hands
of
people
who
enter
the
public
financing
system
in
order
to
run
a
competitive
race.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
think,
to
the
contrary,
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
just
the
state
is
estimating
how
much
a
person
will
spend.
here
the
state
is
measuring
how
much
a
person
will
spend.
the
only
difference
is
that
one
is
more
accurate
than
the
other.
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
prevent
corruption.
that's
what
the
purpose
of
all
public
financing
systems
are.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
maurer,
some
people
may
use
certain
buzz
words
and
other
people
don't
use
those
buzz
words,
but
isn't
it
true
that
for
40
years
what
public
financing
systems
have
been
based
upon
is
the
idea
that
when
there
is
a
lot
of
private
money
floating
around
the
political
system,
that
candidates
and
then
public
office
holders
get
beholden
to
various
people
who
are
giving
that
money
and
make
actions
based
on
how
much
they
receive
from
those
people,
and
that's
the
idea
of
a
public
financing
system
is
to
try
to
prevent
that?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
maurer,
davis
starts
off
by
saying
that
if
what
had
been
triggered
was
not
an
inequitable
contribution
limit
raised
but
instead
both
a
contribution
raised
for
both
candidates,
that
would
have
been
perfectly
appropriate,
notwithstanding
that
that
would
have
put
many
independent
funders
to
a
real
choice.
the
independent
funder
says,
well,
i'm
not
taking
any
contributions,
so
that's
only
going
to
help
my
opponent.
what's
the
difference
in
that
case?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
as
i
said,
the
davis
system
that
was
--
the
system
that
was
specifically
approved
in
davis
would
disincentivize
many
people,
many
independent
funders
from
speaking,
would
put
that
person
to
a
choice
of
the
kind
that
you
say
that
your
clients
are
being
put
to
a
choice,
the
exact
same
kind
of
choice.
justice
elena
kagan
the
first
amendment's
core
purpose
is
to
foster
a
vibrant
political
system
full
of
robust
discussion
and
debate.
nothing
in
arizona's
anti-corruption
statute,
the
citizens
clean
elections
act,
violates
this
constitutional
protection.
to
the
contrary,
the
act
promotes
the
values
underlying
both
the
first
amendment
and
our
entire
constitution.
it
does
so
by
enhancing
the
opportunity
for
free
electoral
discussion
while
preventing
the
kind
of
corruption
that
can
wreck
democratic
governance.
this
court
is
wrong
to
invalidate
the
state's
important
initiative.
the
idea
behind
arizona's
statute
is
straightforward.
when
elected
officials
are
holding
to
big
donors,
they
may
act
to
serve
those
special
interests
rather
than
the
interests
of
all
americans.
to
prevent
corrupt
deals
of
this
kind,
arizona
has
turned
to
the
public
financing
of
elections.
by
supplanting
private
cash
in
elections,
public
financing
eliminates
the
source
of
political
corruption
and
makes
sure
elected
officials
serve
us
all.
for
this
reason,
we
have
previously
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
public
financing.
the
statutory
provision
of
the
clean
elections
act
invalidated
today,
the
so-called
matching
funds
provision
simply
ensures
that
arizona's
public
financing
system
works.
the
provision
makes
public
financing
effective
in
attacking
corruption
and
also
makes
public
financing
sustainable
overtime
by
ensuring
that
its
cause
is
not
prohibitive.
the
provision
achieves
these
results
by
setting
the
amount
of
the
public
subsidy
at
an
appropriate
level
for
each
race.
at
a
level,
that
does
not
waste
the
taxpayer
dollars
but
that
assures
candidates
that
if
they
signup
for
public
financing,
they
will
be
given
sufficient
resources
to
run
a
competitive
campaign.
so
the
idea
of
the
clean
elections
act
is
just
this
simple.
the
matching
funds
mechanism
is
necessary
to
make
public
financing
work
and
public
financing
as
necessary
to
prevent
corruption
to
break
the
stranglehold
of
special
interests
on
our
system
of
government.
that
was
what
arizona
voters
thought
when
they
passed
this
act
by
referendum.
there
is
nothing
unconstitutional
about
that.
the
law
here
does
not
impose
any
restriction
or
substantial
burden
on
speech.
it
does
not
prevent
anyone
from
speaking
and
it
does
not
tell
anyone
what
they
should
say
or
how
they
should
say
it.
to
the
contrary,
this
law
puts
into
place
a
subsidy
program
that
serves
nearly
to
fund
additional
electoral
expression.
the
program
does
not
discriminate
against
any
idea
or
any
speaker.
it
is
open
to
all
candidates,
republican
or
democrat,
conservative
or
liberal
who
wish
to
avail
themselves
of
its
benefits.
all
the
law
does
is
fund
more
speech
and
as
this
court
said
just
last
year
it
is
our
law
and
our
tradition
that
more
speech,
not
less,
is
the
governing
rule.
that
is
the
consistent
teaching
of
our
precedents.
when
the
law
creates
speech
rather
than
restrict
speech,
it
is
not
subject
to
the
most
rigorous
form
of
first
amendment
review
so
long
as
it
is
viewpoint
neutral
which
this
law
clearly
is.
and
that
is
so
far
an
obvious
reason,
because
laws
of
this
kind
to
promote
first
amendment
values,
by
fostering
additional
and
responsive
expression,
so
that
the
market
place
of
ideas
can
work
at
its
best
by
exposing
citizens
to
all
kinds
of
opinions
and
enabling
citizens
to
choose
among
them.
indeed,
we
have
previously
recognized
as
much
in
this
very
context.
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
our
seminal
campaign
finance
case,
we
held
the
public
financing
systems
in
addition
to
preventing
corruption
served
first
amendment
values
by
ensuring
that
uninhibited,
robust,
and
wide-open
public
debate
would
thrive.
the
court
forgets
all
this
in
today's
opinion.
and
something
else
is
wrong
with
this
decision.
even
if
the
arizona
law
merited
rigorous
first
amendment
review,
it
should
pass
that
test
because
the
state
has
come
forward
with
a
clear
uncontestable
and
compelling
interest
attacking
political
corruption.
we
have
long
recognized
that
combating
corruption
is
a
compelling
government
interest.
it
is
after
all
the
point
of
our
entire
constitutional
enterprise
to
build
and
maintain
a
government
accountable
to
the
many
not
beholding
to
the
few.
and
arizona
has
presented
a
forceful
argument
here
that
a
successful
public
financing
system
is
necessary
to
this
end,
and
if
the
matching
funds
provision
is
a
critical
piece
of
this
system,
the
thing
that
spells
the
difference
between
its
success
and
its
failure.
the
majority
today
does
not
say
anything
to
rebut
this
argument.
arizonans
deserve
better,
like
citizens
across
this
country,
arizonans
deserve
a
government
that
represents
and
serves
them
all.
and
arizonans
deserve
the
chance
to
reform
their
electoral
system
to
achieve
this
most
american
of
goals.
for
these
reasons
and
other
as
elaborated
in
my
opinion,
i
respectfully
dissent.
