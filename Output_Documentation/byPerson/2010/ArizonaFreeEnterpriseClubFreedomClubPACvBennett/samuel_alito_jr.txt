justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
there
be
anything
unconstitutional
about
a
system
that
worked
roughly
like
this?
at
the
beginning
--
at
some
point
prior
to
each
election
cycle,
the
commission
that
supervises
this
law
would
make
a
calculation
about
how
much
money
would
be
needed
for
a
candidate
in
a
gubernatorial
race
or
a
state
senate
race
or
an
assembly
race,
if
that's
what
it's
called
in
arizona,
to
get
that
candidate's
message
out
to
the
electorate,
and
that
would
be
the
amount
of
the
public
funding,
period.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
court
after
this
argument
sent
you
a
letter
saying
if
you
would
like
to
file
an
additional
brief,
you
have
the
opportunity
to
do
so,
and
we're
not
going
to
allow
your
opponent
to
file
a
brief.
would
you
take
advantage
of
that
opportunity?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
if
we
said
you
can
file
an
extra
brief,
but
if
you
do
that
your
opponent
will
also
be
able
to
file
an
extra
brief.
would
that
figure
in
your
thinking?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there
are
states
that
have
public
funding
without
having
a
matching
fund
provision.
i
would
appreciate
it
if
you
would
compare
these
two
regimes.
the
first
is
exactly
what
arizona
has
now.
the
second
is
exactly
what
arizona
has
now
minus
the
matching
fund
provision.
so
under
the
second
one
you
have
very
strict
contribution
limits,
and
you
have
reporting
of
all
contributions.
now,
why
does
the
addition
of
the
matching
fund
provision
serve
an
anticorruption
interest?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
even
if
it
is
the
case
that
those
candidates
who
choose
not
to
participate
are
willing
to
spend
additional
money
even
though
it
triggers
matching
funds,
i
don't
see
what
that
proves.
a
candidate
who
is
deciding
whether
to
participate
or
not
presumably
makes
a
calculation
at
the
beginning:
do
i
want
to
spend
more
than
the
matching
fund
amount,
even
though
i
know
that
if
i
do
that,
the
other
side
will
get
additional
money?
now,
if
they
say,
no,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
under
those
circumstances,
they
will
take
the
public
financing.
and
if
they
choose
the
private
financing,
it
means
they
probably
made
a
decision
going
in
that
they're
going
to
--
they're
going
to
be
one
of
those
who
is
willing
to
suffer
the
consequences
of
spending
over
the
amount.
so
i
don't
see
what
this
--
i
don't
see
what
that
proves.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
a
question
that
goes
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
which
i
don't
think
you
fully
had
a
chance
to
--
or
fully
answered?
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
independent
expenditures.
let's
say
there
are
two
candidates
running
for
governor,
and
one
who
is
a
participating
candidate
is
taking
a
position
on
a
very
controversial
arizona
issue
with
which
i
disagree,
and
the
other
is
a
non-participating
candidate
who
is
taking
a
position
on
that
controversial
issue
and
i
agree
with
that.
now,
if
i
choose
to
run
an
ad,
pay
for
an
ad
supporting
the
non-participating
candidate,
i
know
that
the
--
the
candidate
that
i
dislike
on
that
issue
is
going
to
get
an
additional
amount
of
funds,
and
--
but
if
i
choose
to
run
an
ad
supporting
the
participating
candidate,
the
opposite
doesn't
happen.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
clear-cut
discrimination
based
on
the
content
of
speech?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
i'm
the
independent
--
if
i'm
the
independent
expenditure
maker,
i
haven't
made
a
choice
at
the
beginning.
i
haven't
decided
to
participate
or
not
participate.
what
i
care
about
is
the
issue
that's
being
debated
between
these
two
candidates.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
would
you
agree
that
the
matching
fund
provision
by
itself
does
not
serve
an
anticorruption
purpose?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
you
just
said
was
that
this
law
aims
to
allow
publicly
financed
candidates
to
run
on
the
same
footing
as
privately
financed
candidates;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right,
and
that's
equal--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that's
equal
--
that's
leveling
the
playing
field,
isn't
it?
