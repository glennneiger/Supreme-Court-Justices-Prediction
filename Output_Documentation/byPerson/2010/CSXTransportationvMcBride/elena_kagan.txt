justice
elena
kagan
mr.
rothfeld,
could
you
explain
to
me
how
it
would
have
made
a
difference
in
this
case,
that
instruction?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
rothfeld,
are
there
any
cases
like
that
in
the
fela
world?
you
know,
i
take
it
that
this
basic
instruction
that
was
given
in
this
case
is
the
instruction
that's
given
in
most
cases.
if
you
look
across
the
range
of
cases,
do
you
find
jurors
awarding
damages
in
the
kind
of
situation
that
you're
talking
about?
in
other
words,
is
this
a
real-world
problem?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
rothfeld,
your
instruction
actually
used
the
term
"probable
cause".
are
you
--
"proximate
cause".
are
you
saying
now
that
that's
not
necessary,
that
as
long
as
you
say
"reasonable
and
foreseeable",
you
would
be
satisfied?
justice
elena
kagan
so
why
use
it
at
all?
if
you
think
that
"reasonable"
or
"foreseeable"
are
less
confusing
words,
why
shouldn't
we
just
tell
the
jury
to
use
those
words
instead?
justice
elena
kagan
but
wasn't
the
theory
different,
mr.
rothfeld?
wasn't
the
theory
that
the
configuration
of
the
train
made
the
braking
and
the
switching
much
more
difficult
for
the
person
in
this
position?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry,
mr.
rothfeld,
i
didn't
understand
what
you
just
said,
because
the
requested
jury
instruction
that
--
that
you
gave
was
any
cause
which
in
natural
or
probable
sequence
produced
the
injury.
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
so
that's
essentially
saying
that
the
jury
has
to
say
it's
51
percent
likely
to
produce
the
injury,
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it
says
natural
or
probable,
and
probable
means
more
likely
than
not,
which
is
51
percent.
