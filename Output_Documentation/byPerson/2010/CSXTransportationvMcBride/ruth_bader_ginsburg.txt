justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
also
said
that
there's
a
relaxed
standard
of
causation.
i
think
that's
what
justice
kennedy
is
referring
to
when
he
said
"proximate
cause
light".
but
we
have
said
in
more
than
one
case
that
there
is
a
relaxed
standard
of
causation
in
fela
cases.
was
that
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
line
of
cases
i
think
in
the
'40s
in
the
fela
cases
where
the
message
of
this
court
seemed
to
be
quite
clear,
fela
cases
go
to
juries?
there
are
a
number
of
cases
with
reverse
dissents
that
seem
to
--
to
say
just
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
--
can
you
explain
to
me
--
i
mean,
here
the
judge
charged
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
and
they
are
also
the
words
used
in
the
model
federal
instruction:
did
plaintiff's
injury
result
in
whole
or
in
part
from
the
railroad's
negligence?
you
would
say:
was
plaintiff's
injury
proximately
caused.
and
as
you
no
doubt
know,
mr.
rothfeld,
that
term
"proximate
cause",
it
just
loses
juries.
so
considering
that
these
cases
go
to
the
jury,
what
do
you
say
to
the
instruction
that's
now
given,
based
on
the
words
of
the
statute,
"did
plaintiff's
injury
result
in
whole
or
part
from
the
railroad's
negligence?
"
what
should
the
judge
charge
instead
of
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
explain
the
difference.
i
mean,
you
were
answering
my
question,
and
i
asked
how
would
you
tell
the
jury?
you
said
it's
okay
to
say:
did
plaintiff's
injury
result
in
whole
or
in
part
from
the
railroad's
negligence,
but
the
judge
must
say
something
more.
so
what
is
the
something
more?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
natural,
probable,
and
foreseeable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
give
some
examples
of
what
causes
would
be
proximate
and
what
causes
would
not
so
qualify?
something
that's
--
you
said
but-for
is
no
good.
so
what
would
be
a
but-for
cause
but
not
a
proximate
cause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
spelling
out
is
natural,
probable,
and
foreseeable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
any
--
any
negligence-type
statutes?
i
mean
this
one,
i
mean,
it's
odd
to
say
that
the
judge
erred
in
reading
to
the
jury
the
words
of
the
statute,
did
plaintiff's
injury
result
in
whole
or
in
part
from
railroad
negligence.
all
that
federal
statutes,
negligence
statutes
that
use
the
word
"proximate"--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
said
your
defense
at
trial
was
not
about
causation,
it
was
no
negligence,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
suppose
a
juror
says,
we
wouldn't
--
goes
to
the
judge
and
says,
we
would
like
to
have
an
explanation
of,
what
does
it
mean
that
the
injury
results
in
whole
or
in
part
from
the
railroad's
negligence?
what
would
the
judge
respond?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
have
three
justices
of
this
court
that
say
rogers
is
irrelevant
because
it
had
to
do
only
with
multiple
causes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
--
they
--
they
did
ask
for
proximate
cause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
case
i
have
is
csx
transportation
v.
mcbride.
this
case
concerns
the
causation
standard
applicable
in
lawsuits
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
today
properly
known
as
fela.
enacted
in
1908,
fela
renders
railroads
liable
for
a
worker's
injury
or
death
resulting
in
whole
or
in
part
from
the
railroads
negligence.
the
question
before
us,
does
fela
incorporate
by
the
act's
silence
stock
proximate
cause
formulations
developed
in
common
law
tort
actions,
for
example,
in
ones
--
was
in
buggy
and
now
automobile
accident
cases.
or
should
get
us
causation
instructions
instead
speak
to
the
jury
in
the
language
of
the
statute?
the
term
proximate
cause,
first
year
law
students
learn,
expresses
in
shorthand
the
concept
that
injuries
have
countless
causes
but
those
stretching
that
too
far
should
not
give
rise
to
legal
liability.
common
law
courts
having
employed
many
different
verbal
formulations
to
convey
to
juries
just
what
proximate
cause
means.
often
those
formulations
are
restrictive.
for
example,
juries
have
been
told
that
a
plaintiff
cannot
recover
if
the
causal
link
between
defendant's
conduct
and
plaintiff's
injury
was
insufficiently
substantial
or
if
there
was
any
intervening
cause
or
if
the
relationship
between
cause
and
injury
was
not
direct
or
natural
or
probable.
we
hold
that
none
of
those
formulations
express
the
proper
feel
or
causation
standard.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
robert
mcbride,
was
injured
while
performing
a
switching
operation
for
his
employer
csx
transportation,
an
interstate
railroad,
and
the
petitioner
here.
alleging
that
csx
had
provided
unsafe
equipment
and
inadequate
training,
mcbride
sued
the
railroad
in
federal
district
court
in
illinois
seeking
compensation
under
fela.
a
verdict
for
mcbride
was
in
order,
the
district
judge
instructed,
if
the
jury
found
that
csx
was
negligent
and
that
the
railroad's
negligence
cause
or
contributed
to
mcbride's
injury.
the
railroad
sought
an
additional
instruction
requiring
mcbride
to
show
that
the
railroad's
negligence
was
a
proximate
cause
of
his
injury.
if
the
railroad
proposed
to
define
proximate
cause
to
mean
any
cause,
which
in
natural
or
probable
sequence
produced
the
injury
complained
off.
the
district
court
refused
to
give
the
instructions
csx
requested
and
instead
the
district
court
read
to
the
jury,
the
seventh
circuits
have
an
instructions
for
causation
in
fela
cases.
defendant
--
defendant
caused
or
contributed
to
plaintiff's
injury,
if
defendant's
negligence
played
a
part
no
matter
how
small
in
bringing
about
the
injury.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
for
mcbride.
on
appeal
the
railroad
contended
that
the
district
court
should
have
instructed
the
jury
as
csx
requested
on
proximate
causation.
the
seventh
circuit
disagreed
and
affirmed
the
judgment
entered
on
the
jury's
verdict.
the
appeals
court
explained
that
the
causation
instruction
the
district
court
gave
paraphrase
language
from
this
court's
1957
decision
in
rogers
v.
missouri,
missouri
pacific
railroad.
roger
stated
under
fela,
the
test
of
the
jury
case
is
simply
whether
the
proofs
justified
the
conclusion
that
employer
negligence
played
any
part
even
the
slightest
in
producing
the
injury.
we
agree
with
the
seventh
circuit
that
fela
does
not
incorporate
staff
proximate
cause
instructions
developed
in
non-statutory
common
law
tort
actions
and
we
therefore
affirmed
the
court
of
appeals
judgment.
the
railroad
urges
that
rogers
addressed
only
the
problem
of
injuries
with
multiple
causes
typically
plaintiffs
own
negligence
as
well
as
the
defendant's
lack
of
due
care.
for
reasons
set
out
only
in
the
court's
opinion,
we
reject
that
in
our
reading
and
instead
read
rogers
to
state
comprehensively
--
and
comprehensively,
the
fela
causation
standard
for
all
cases.
our
understanding
of
fela's
causation
standard
tracks,
the
acts
text
and
is
consistent
with
the
legislation's
history.
it
also
accords
with
the
view
of
every
federal
court
of
appeals
that
reviews
fela
cases.
failing
to
instruct
on
proximate
cause,
csx
worries
will
invite
juries
to
impose
limitless
liability
on
railroads.
we
see
little
cause
for
that
concern,
instructions
like
the
one
given
at
--
in
mcbride's
case
have
been
read
to
juries
in
countless
cases
over
the
last
50
years.
yet
the
railroad
road
was
unable
to
identify
even
a
single
trial
in
which
such
an
instruction
generated
and
outlined
this
award.
