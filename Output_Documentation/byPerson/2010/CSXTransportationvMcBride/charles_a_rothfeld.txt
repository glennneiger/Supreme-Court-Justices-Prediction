mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
we
find
ourselves
in
the
happy
situation
of
having
to
try
to
convince
the
court
that
its
prior
decisions
were
correct.
just
5
years
after
the
enactment
of
fela,
the
court
declared
that
it
was
obvious
that
the
statute
contained
a
proximate
cause
requirement.
the
court
went
on
to
repeat
that
conclusion
over
and
over
again
in
almost
two
dozen
decisions
over
the
next
40
years.
our
submission
this
morning
is
that
the
court
when
it
made
these
statements
got
it
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
we
--
we
--
our
submission
is
that
that
is
not
correct,
that
that
is
not
what
fela
provides
for
at
all.
and
in
the
court's
initial
decisions,
the
ones
that
i
referred
to,
it
stated
very
clearly
that
the
ordinary
proximate
cause
rule
applies.
the
--
the
proximate
cause
test
that
the
court
stated
in
cases
like
brady
was
the
traditional
proximate
cause
standard.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that
--
that's
--
is
a
separate
one
from
the
one
we
have
here.
i
mean,
we
are
talking
here
about
the
nature
of
the
--
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
that
have
to
be
demonstrated
by
--
by
the
plaintiff;
and
so
there
--
the
question
of
how
much
of
that
evidence
there
has
to
be
to
get
to
the
jury
is
a
separate
question
that's
not
presented
here.
our
submission,
since
you
posed
the
question,
is
that
there
is
no
different
standard;
that
fela
was
not
intended
to
depart
from
the
ordinary
common
law
procedural
approaches
in
that
respect,
either.
but
on
the
question
that's
presented--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
wouldn't
want
to
commit
myself
to
answering
that
question
affirmatively,
your
honor.
the
court
has
said
that
--
that
fela
was
enacted
to
address
particular
problems
in
the
administration
of
the
common
law
prior
to
1908.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
there
are
two
ways
to
respond
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
is
that
up
until
the
rogers
decision,
which
is
--
which
is
one
of
the
ones
which
has
created
i
think
some
confusion
in
this
area,
the
court
was
quite
clear
and
unambiguous
that
proximate
cause
in
fela
applied
in
the
ordinary
sense.
as
i
say,
in
cases
like
the
brady
case
the
court
stated
what
proximate
cause
means;
it
stated
in
--
in
entirely
traditional
terms
that
--
that
the
plaintiff
had
to
demonstrate
that
the
injury
followed
in
a
natural,
probable
foreseeable
way
from
the
wrongful
conduct,
and
so
that
--
that
was
the
standard.
the
rogers
case,
which
was
the
source
of
some
of
the
confusion
in
this
area,
in
our
view,
as
--
as
we
think
justice
souter
correctly
demonstrated
in
his
opinion
in
sorrell,
and
as
we
explain
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
rogers
we
think
did
not
address
causation
at
all.
the
rogers
case
was
a
situation
in
which
there
were
a
multiplicity
of
causes,
and
the
question
was
what
--
what
should
--
should
the
rule
be
when
there
are
a
number
of
--
of
entities
that
contribute
to
the
accident.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
remoteness
or
directness
of
the
cause,
what
we
usually
think
about
when
we
talk
about
proximate
cause.
in
--
in
the
years
since
rogers
was
decided,
when
the
court
--
got
out
of
the
business
of
deciding
fela
cases
on
the
facts,
it
had
not
had
occasion
on
--
in
any
case
to
address
specifically
what
proximate
cause
meant
in
the
fela
context.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
--
that
comes
from,
wsubmit,
from
sort
of
a
loose
description
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
rogers
case,
which
involved
a
multiplicity
of
causes
rather
than
directness
and
remoteness
of
causes,
and
so
the
cases
in
which
that
language
appears,
which
are
the
crane
case
and
the
gottshall
case,
did
not
involve
causation
at
all.
the
question
of
causation
was
not
presented
to
the
court
in
those
cases.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that
--
that
goes
to
the
question
that
justice
kennedy
raised
at
the
outset,
which
is
how
much
evidence,
whatever
the
standard
of
causation
is,
how
much
evidence
must
there
be
to
go
to
the
jury?
and
our
presentation
here
is
that
fela
did
not
change
the
ordinary
standard
on
--
on
that
question.
but
that
--
but
that
is
not
the
question
that's
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
two
parts
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg.
one
--
one
is,
what's
wrong
with
the
instruction
that
was
given
here;
and
the
other
is
can
juries
understand
proximate
cause
as
a
concept.
on
--
on
the
first
point,
we
have
no
objection
to
the
instruction
containing
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
problem
is
that
to
be
comprehensible
and
intelligently
applied
by
jurors,
it
has
to
say
more
than
that.
proximate
cause
we
submit
is
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action
and
that
has
to
be
explained
to
a
jury.
it
couldn't
be
the
case
in
a
sherman
act
case,
for
example,
that
a
judge
could
simply
charge
the
jury:
you
are
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade;
now
go
to
the
jury
room
and
answer
that
question.
there
is
a
lot
more
that
has
to
go
into
that
cause
of
action,
including,
as
it
happens,
proximate
cause.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
--
it
would
have
made
a
difference
i
guess
in
two
respects.
one
is
that
the
plaintiff's
theory
has
never
at
any
point
been
that
there
was
proximate
cause
in
this
case.
he
did
not
contend
that
there
was
before
the
--
the
district
court
and
he
does
not
contend
in
his
brief
before
this
court
that
there
was
proximate
cause
made
out.
and
so--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
something
more
is
what
this
court
said
in
its
brady
decision,
in
which
it
described
--
the
decision
in
brady,
which
is
cited
and
discussed
in
our
opening
brief
in
--
in
some
detail.
brady
described
what
proximate
cause
means
in
the
fela
context;
and
it
means,
the
court
said,
that
there
must
be
a
demonstration
that
the
plaintiff's
injury
resulted
from
the
wrongful
conduct
in
a
way
that
was
natural,
probable,
and
foreseeable.
that
--
that
was
a
traditional
statement,
is
still
today
a
traditional
statement
of
proximate
cause.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
and
foreseeable.
that
--
that
language
was
taken
in
the
brady
case
directly
from
the
court's
decision,
1876
decision
in
the
kellogg
decision,
which
we
also
cite
in
our
brief,
which
states--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
that
--
that
was
the
second
part
of
justice
ginsburg's
question,
and
i
got
distracted,
and
i'm
happy
to
address
it.
i
think
most
of
the
criticism
of
proximate
cause
as
being
confusion
to
the
jury
has
actually
been
directed
at
the
word
"proximate",
that
commentators
and
some
courts
have
said
that's
a
confusing
word,
it
suggests
immediacy,
it
suggests
closeness
in
time,
it
sounds
like
"approximate",
and
so
juries
find
it
confusing.
but
there
is
--
once
it's
spelled
out,
i
mean,
the
fact
is
juries
have
been
applying
proximate
cause,
which
has
been
a
fundamental,
settled,
universal,
universally
accepted
part
of
common
law
of
torts,
in
the
medicine
context
in
particular,
and
it
has
been
settled
for
150
years.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
--
it
is
our
submission
that
fela
juries
would
have
no
more
difficulty
applying
it
than
do
juries
under
the
sherman
act
or
rico
or
the
securities
laws
or,
the
other
statutes
that
this
court
has
said
include
a
proximate
cause
requirement,
or
that
juries
apply
every
day
in
courts
across
the
country
in
court
cases.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
we
have
to
assume
that
juries
follow
jury
instructions.
that's
the
fundamental
premise
of
the
system,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
in
the
ordinary
case,
in
which
the
contents
of
proximate
cause
are
--
are
explained
to
the
jury
in
an
intelligent
--
in
a
way
that
--
that
people
can
comprehend.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
the
--
if
the
jury--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
--
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
will
endorse
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
certainly,
in
terms--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
--
the
--
the
principle
of
proximate
cause,
the
idea
that
there
has
to
be
some
limitation
beyond
but-for
causation
on
liability,
has
been
universally
recognized.
recognized
by
--
by
courts,
by
this
court,
by
commentators,
by
the
restatement.
the
third
restatement,
just
published,
clearly
endorsed
it.
they
use
--
they
quibble
about
the
terminology,
but
they
clearly
endorsed
the
absolute
necessity
of
a
proximate
cause
limitation
on
liability.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
there
--
there
probably
has
been.
i
mean,
i'll
defer
again
to
the
third
restatement,
which
has
a
very
useful
summary
of
the
course
of
the
law
in
this
area.
and
the
principal
tests
that
are
now
being
used
by
courts
are
foreseeability
and
directness,
which
are
closely
related,
i
think.
i
mean,
clearly,
as
this
court
stated
just
this
month
in
the
stout
case,
it
stated
a
test
of
proximate
cause
in
terms
of
whether--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--a
but-for
cause
in
this
context
would
be,
there's
a
defective
brake
on
--
on
the
locomotive
and
it
comes
to
a
sudden
stop.
if
the
conductor,
standing
in
the
locomotive
when
the
train
stops,
is
thrown
to
the
floor
and
injured,
clearly
that
is
proximate
cause.
it
--
it
is
--
it
is
an
injury
that
is
related
to
the
risk
that
made
the
conduct
actionable
in
the
first
place.
the
reason
that
having
defective
brakes
is
negligent
and
gives
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
is
because
it
can
cause
an
accident
that
will
cause
people
to
fall,
cause
the
train
to
hit
something,
will
cause
derailment.
that's
why
it
is
negligent,
and
if
the
kind
of
injury
that
follows
from
the
accident
is
related
to
that
risk,
that
clearly
is
proximate
cause.
the
kind
which
is
not
would
be,
train
stops
because
of
the
defective
brake.
no
one
is
injured.
conductor
gets
off
the
train
to
walk
along
and
see
what's
going
on,
trips
and
turns
his
leg,
or
is
bitten
by
a
snake.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
they
did
in
precisely
the
case
i
just
described,
a
case
called
richards
from
the
sixth
circuit,
which
is
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
submitted
by
the
association
of
american
railroads.
the
train
stops
because
of
a
defective
brake,
the
conductor
gets
off,
walks
along,
turns
his
ankle
and
sues.
clearly,
the
risk
of
someone
getting
off
the
train
and
having
a
fortuitous
injury
is
not
the
kind
of
risk
that
gave
rise
to
the
negligence.
i
mean,
it's
negligent
to
have
a
defective
brake,
but
not
because
there's
a
bystander
who
might
be
bitten
by
a
snake
or
turn
--
turn
his
ankle.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
as
i
said,
the
richards
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
--
i
can't
cite
you
a
snake
case
directly,
but--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--or
i'll
--
i'll
cite
you--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i'll
give
you
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
there
are
other
cases.
another
case,
for
example,
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
that
i
referred
to
is
the
schlumpert
case
from
georgia,
in
which
there's
a
defective
coupling
device
lying
on
the
ground.
if
it
had
--
if
it
had
fallen
off
the
train
because
it
was
defective
and
fallen
on
someone's
foot,
clearly
that's
proximate
cause.
but
it's
on
the
ground.
the
employee
comes
along,
picks
it
up,
throws
off
--
throws
off
his
--
throws
out
his
back,
and
sues.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
--
of
injury
that
one
would
foresee
comes
from
having
defective
couplers.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
instruction
we
ask
for
is
the
one
this
court
gave
--
said
should
be
given
in
the
brady
case:
natural,
foreseeable,
and
probable.
it
is
not--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
would
--
i
would
say
that
it
is--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well
--
well,
i'm
just
quoting
the
court's
language
to
you,
your
honor.
but
--
but
certainly,
foreseeable
and
probable,
one
would
say
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
but
it's
not
foreseeable
in
the
sense
that
it
is
unrelated
to
the
risk
that
gave
rise
to
--
to
the
cause
of
action
in
the
first
place.
i
mean,
it's
foreseeable
in
the
sense
that
anything
is
foreseeable.
if
i
give
the
classic
example:
i
drive
--
i
drive
you
to
new
york,
from
washington
to
new
york,
and
i
drive
too
fast,
exceeding
the
speed
limit.
that's
negligent.
it's
negligent
because
i
run
the
risk,
if
i
drive
too
fast,
of
hitting
somebody,
of
hitting
another
car,
of
driving
off
the
road.
and
so
if
i
do
that
and
you're
injured
as
i
drive
you
to
new
york,
you
can
sue
me.
but
that
doesn't
happen.
i
drive
--
i
get
to
new
york
safely,
you
get
out
of
the
car,
and
as
soon
as
you
get
out,
you
are
struck
by
lightning.
it's
a
but-for
cause
of
your
being
struck
by
lightning
that
i
drove
too
fast.
you
wouldn't
have
been
there
when
the
lightning
struck.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
or
--
or,
more
likely,
you
could
have
been
hit
--
hit
by
a
car
driving
across
fifth
avenue
too
fast.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
it
should
include
the
term
"proximate"
simply
because
that
has
traditionally
been
the
requirement.
that's
what
this
court
has
said
in
cases
like
brady.
it's
what
the
court
has
said
in
cases
applying
other
proximate
cause
--
other
elements
of
proximate
causation
in
other
circumstances.
but
it
is
the
concept.
i
mean,
as
i
said,
"proximate"
is
a
confusing
word.
that
has
been
recognized
sort
of
across
the
board.
so
it
has
to
be
spelled
out
and
unpacked.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
--
again,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
essential
that
it
use
the
word
"proximate"
if
it
spells
out
what
is
meant
by
"proximate"
in
--
in
--
as--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--again,
that
is
the
term
that
this
court
used
in
brady,
and
that
is
--
is
closely
related--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
did
not
use
the
word
"foreseeable".
it
used
"natural
and
probable".
but
we
--
we
endorse,
again,
the
test
that
this
court
has
stated
in
the
fela
context
very
clearly
in
the
brady
case.
there
are
--
as
has
been
noted
in
some
of
the
questioning,
there
has
been
discussion
between
courts
and
commentators
over
the
years
about
what
the
best
way
is
to
define
proximate
cause
and
explain
it
to
the
jury.
i
mean,
in
terms
of
the
question
posed
by
the
chief
justice,
does
it
actually
make
any
difference,
i
think
not
only
do
we
have
to
assume
that
it
makes
a
difference,
because
juries
are
presumed
to
follow
their
instructions,
but
the
kind
of
instruction
that
was
given
here
was
essentially
a
but-for
instruction,
that
if
you
find
that
--
that
in
any
respect,
the
injuries
essentially
would
not
have
occurred
but
for
the
misconduct,
for
the
--
for
the
negligence
of
the
railroad--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well
--
that
--
that
--
that's
his
explanation
of
the
accident.
the
theory
of
negligence,
as
i
understand
it,
as
it
was
presented
to
the
jury
by
his
expert
was
that
the
configuration
of
the
train
that
he
was
driving
was
unsafe
because
it
--
it
could
lead
to
derailments,
it
could
lead
to
breaking
of
the
couplers.
as
explained
by
his
expert,
the
--
the
theory
was
not
that
there
was
something
unsafe
about
the
arrangement
of
the
braking
system,
and
so,
i
think
that
the
--
the
way
in
which
a
proximate
cause
instruction
properly
given
here
could
have
made
a
difference
is
that
the
jury
could
have
found,
well,
yes,
it
was
negligent
to
have
these
five
locomotives
arranged
in
the
way
that
they
were,
but
that
had
nothing
to
do,
except
in
a
but-for
sense,
with
the
fact
that
the
--
the
--
that
mr.
mcbride's
hand
was
injured;
that
the
jury
could
have
made
that
determination
and
so
it
could
have
made
a
difference.
now,
i
mean,
the
fact
is
there
was
no
proximate
cause
argument
made
below
because
the
instruction
that
was
given
by
the
district
court
excluded
it.
and
so,
as
i
said
before,
the
--
the
theory
of
the
case
advanced
by
mr.
mcbride
below
simply
didn't
take
account
of
proximate
cause.
now,
if
the
--
if
we
prevail
here
and
the
case
goes
back,
he
will
be
free
to
argue
under
a
proper
instruction
that
there
was
proximate
cause,
that
somehow
the
configuration
of
the
train
affected
his
--
his
handling
of
the
brake.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there
--
there
is
no
question
that
what
the
railroad
did
caused
in
the
but-for
sense.
mr.
mcbride
would
not
have
been
in
the
cab
operating
the
brake
system
had
it
--
had
it
not
been
for
the
configuration
of
the
--
of
the
locomotives.
and,
so
if
we
assume
that
the
configuration
of
the
locomotives
was
negligent,
then
but
for
the
negligence
of
--
of
the
railroad,
this
would
not
have
occurred.
and
that
in
fact
is
--
is
the
terms
in
which
the
case
was
argued
to
the
jury
by
mr.
mcbride's
lawyer,
who
said,
in
so
many
words:
but
for
the
negligence
of
the
railroad,
this
would
not
have
occurred.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
our
side
argued
that
there
was
no
negligence
at
all,
that
--
that
--
that
the
configuration
of
the
railroad
was
perfectly
proper,
and
that
--
the
--
the
--
there
was
a
contributory
negligence
component
to
what
was
going
on
here.
in
fact,
the
jury
found
that
mr.
mcbride
was
contributorily
negligent
in
part,
and
that
was
part
of
the
--
of
the
defense
presentation,
too.
but
just
two
or
three
--
to
take
a
step
back
to
first
principles,
on
the
assumption
that
proximate
cause
--
that
there
is
a
difference
between
instructing
the
jury
on
proximate
cause
and
not,
because
the
court
--
it
has
been
a
part
of
tort
law,
you
know,
for
time
immemorial
on
the
assumption
that
it
does
make
a
difference
and
it
has
been
an
important
part
of
tort
law
because
it
has
been
universally
recognized
by
courts,
by
academics,
by
the
respondent
that
there
has
to
be
some
limitation
on
liability
beyond
but-for
causation.
if
there
is
not,
there
is
the
danger
of
sort
of
infinite
liability,
of
limitless
liability,
and
particularly
of
fortuitous
liability,
because
there
is
no
way
that
the
defendant
in
a
situation
like
this
can
anticipate
that
it's
going
to
be
held
liable
for
this
kind
of
injury.
so
proximate
cause
has
been
regarded
as
an
essential
component
of
the
tort
law.
and
that
being
so,
fela
creates
a
federal
cause
of
action
for
negligence,
it
creates
a
federal
tort.
it
--
a
fundamental
principle
of
statutory
interpretation,
this
court
has
applied
many
times,
most
recently
just
this
month
in
the
staub
case,
that
when
congress
creates
a
federal
tort,
it
means
to
adopt
the
general
background
of
tort
law,
and
congress--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--there
are
--
there
are
federal
statutes
that
use
the
word
"proximate".
i
don't
know
that
there
are
any
negligence
statutes.
so
far
as
i
understand
from
our
review
of
the
law,
at
the
time
that
congress
enacted
fela
in
1908,
there
--
there
were
no
such
statutes
that
made
use
of
the
term
"proximate".
and
the
presumption
then,
as
now,
is
that
when
congress
creates
what
amounted
to
a
federal
tort,
the
assumption
is
that
it
intends
to
adopt
a
background
of
tort
law.
that
was
true
in
the
sherman
act,
it
was
true
in
rico,
it
was
true
in
securities
laws,
it
was
true
just
as
earlier
this
month
in
the
staub
case,
a
statute
which
did
not
use
the
term
"proximate".
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that's
--
that's
right.
given
the
instruction
that
the
jury
received,
which
does
not
--
did
not
include
a
proximate
cause
requirement,
and
given
that
if
one
assumes
that
there
was
negligence,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
--
that
the
injury
here
was
the
but-for
product
of
that
negligence,
there
sort
of
was
no
room
for
negligence
to
be
argued
to
the
jury
on
the
defense
side.
i
mean,
for
proximate
--
for
--
for
--
for
causation
to
be
argued
on
the
defense
side.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
in
--
in
this
case
we
would
say
the
negligence
that
is
being
presented
to
you
and
that
you
have
presumably
found
is
that
the
configuration
of
these
locomotives
was
dangerous
because
it
could
lead
to
derailment,
it
could
lead
to
breaking
of
the
couplers
between
the
cars.
that
is
the
negligence.
and
proximate
cause,
properly
understood,
means
that
the
injury
on
which
the
plaintiff
is
suing
has
to
follow
in
a
probable,
natural,
foreseeable
way
from
that
--
that
negligence.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
if
i
may,
i'll
answer
that
and
then
sit
down.
that,
as
i
say,
was
not
the
theory
that
was
presented
by
the
plaintiff's
expert.
to
the
extent
that
that
is
--
is
a
viable
theory,
it
could
be
presented
on
remand.
the
argument
can
be
made.
i
think
it's
a
difficult
argument,
but
--
but
it
was
not
presented
to
the
jury
here
because
there
was
no
proximate
cause
instruction,
so
there
was
no
opportunity
for
the
question
to
be
--
be
--
be
vetted.
and
with
that,
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
your
honor,
just
a
few
quick
points.
first,
although
my
friend
mr.
frederick
has
struggled
valiantly,
i
think
that
he
is
unable
to
explain
how
his
test
is
any
different
from
a
"but
for"
causation.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
a
different
kind
of
problem.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
has
been
--
the
rule
of
common
law
from--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
kind
of
--
the
risk
of
--
that
there
would
be
an
injury
follows
from
the
--
the
nature
of
the
misconduct
that
gives
rise
to
liability
in
the
first
place,
and
it
is
--
common
law
has
always
recognized
that
if
you're
risking
a
particular
kind
of
injury,
that
someone
is
going
to
be
hit,
you
take
your
victim
as
your
find
them,
and
that
is
put
--
put
in
a
different
basket
of
--
of
doctrine
altogether.
so
--
so
first,
again
i
--
there
is
no
alternative
to
proximate
cause,
but
"but
for"
cause;
that's
been
universally
recognized
as
an
unacceptable
basis
for
liability.
second,
if
i
could
return
to
our
snake
just
for
a
moment.
it
has
been
recognized
that
the
--
the
nature
of
the
protection
that's
provided
by
the
tort
law
is
related
to
the
--
to
the
risk
of
injury
that
gives
rise
to
liability
in
the
first
place.
if
there
--
the
risk
of
injury
is
that
a
defective
brake
is
going
to
lead
to
a
derailment
or
an
accident,
injury
that
follows
from
that
risk
is
compensable;
injury
that
does
not,
like
walking
along
and
turning
your
leg
or
being
bitten
by
a
snake
is
in
a
different
category,
it's
not
predictable
and
foreseeable
or
natural
in
that
sense.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
question
would
be
one
for
the
jury
if
it's
properly
instructed.
and
in
fact
in
the
gallick
case,
as
i
think
justice
sotomayor,
you
--
you
have
recognized,
the
court
said
that
that
was
foreseeable.
and
the
jury
--
the
issue
can
be
posed
to
the
jury,
the
jury
can
determine
whether
it
is
a
natural
problem.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
--
that's
generally
right.
i
mean,
there
will
be
circumstances,
as
the
restatement
says,
that
--
in
which
it's
so
clear
that
it
is
not
a
--
a
probable,
natural,
foreseeable
consequence
of
--
of
the
wrongful
conduct,
that
it
should
not
go
to
the
jury.
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--they
--
clearly
they
are
closely
related.
i
mean
the
court
in
brady
stated
that
--
that
test,
as
natural,
probable,
foreseeable.
if
it
is
natural
and
probable,
it
is
likely
to
be
foreseeable.
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
it
--
but
i
think
what
probable
means
in
this
context
it
has
to
be
foreseeable,
not
simply
in
the
theoretical,
i
can
foresee
if
i
drive
too
fast
in
new
york,
maybe
there
will
be
a
lightning
strike
--
i
mean,
i
can
imagine
that.
but
it
has
to
have
--
pass
a
certain
threshold
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
--
to
me
the
only
question
now
here
before
this
court
is
whether
we
are
entitled
to
a
jury
instruction
that
states
properly
the
nature
of
the
proximate
cause
test,
and
if
the
case
goes
back
under
that
standard,
then
the
arguments
that
have
been
suggested
by
mr.
frederick
can
be
presented
to
the
jury.
but
--
but
as
you
say,
justice
scalia,
that's
right;
and
to
the
extent
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
instruction,
we
would
provide
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
it
would
be
open
to
argue
that
it's
so
clear
that
--
that
there
was
no
proximate
cause
that
it
shouldn't;
but
that's
a
question
to
be
posed
on
remand.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
was
the
requested
instruction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
--
it
was
not
put
in
those
terms.
i
--
i
would
not
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
again,
it
was
not
--
unpacking
those
terms,
and
i
would
say
it
does
not
have
to
be
--
the
answer
is
--
is
no.
the
jury
doesn't
define
that
it
is
--
it
is
necessarily
going
to
be
the
outcome,
but
it
has
to
find
that
there
is
some
substantial
probability
that
it
will
be
the
outcome,
before
liability
can
attach,
would
be
our
--
our
submission.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
your
honor.
