chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
10-235,
csx
transportation
v.
mcbride.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
just
don't
--
and
maybe
this
has
already
been
asked,
but
i'm
not
sure
from
a
juror's
perspective
that
it
makes
terribly
much
difference
the
exact
formulation
of
this
instruction.
i
think
a
juror
who
sees
an
employee
is
suing
the
railroad,
and
it
turns
out
that
what
the
railroad
did
had
very
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
what
happened
to
the
employee,
they
don't
need
an
instruction
about
natural,
foreseeable
causes.
they're
just
not
going
to
give
the
awards,
or
they're
going
to
give
the
awards
even
though
the
railroad
didn't
do
anything
that
affected
the
employee.
it's
a
--
it's
a
nuance
that
i
just
don't
think
has
any
practical
significance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
point
is
that
i
don't
see
much
practical
difference
between
what
you
argue
is
the
correct
instruction
and
what
your
friend
argues
is
the
correct
instruction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
law
students,
professors,
and
some
judges
have
had
trouble
defining
the
concept
of
proximate
cause
for
centuries.
i
don't
know
why
we
expect
a
juror
to
be
able
to
navigate
through
those
nuances,
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
do
you
want
--
what
instruction
would
you
give
that
would
tell
the
jury
to
allow
damages
in
one
of
those
--
the
first
of
the
coupling
cases,
but
not
in
the
second?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
jurors
going
to
sit
there
and
say,
one
of
those
is
natural,
foreseeable,
and
probable,
but
the
other
isn't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
know
what
"natural"
means.
you
know,
so
it's
not
a
supernatural
situation?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
foreseeable
that
if
you
drop
a
coupling
where
it's
not
supposed
to
be,
somebody
will
come
along
and
try
to
pick
it
up
and
move
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rothfeld,
you
have
4
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
