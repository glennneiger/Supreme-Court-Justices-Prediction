kennedy
how
did
it
happen
that
in
fela
we
have
proximate
cause
light?
it's
just
a
different
proximate
cause
than
we
see
in
other
--
in
other
torts
cases.
how
--
how
did
that
come
about?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
read
the
cases
as
indicating
that
more
deference
is
given
to
juries
in
fela
cases
than
in
other
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
that
over
the
last
few
decades,
there's
been
an
increasing
emphasis
on
foreseeability
as
a
component
of
proximate
cause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
although
your
proposed
instruction
didn't
use
the
word
"foreseeable"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
that
the
phrase
in
the
statute
"in
whole
or
in
part"
allows
juries
to
impose
liability
based
on
but-for
causation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
--
why
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
in
the
jury
room
and
a
juror
says:
this
wouldn't
have
happened
but
for
the
wide
locomotive;
therefore,
there
should
be
liability.
what
--
and
assume
the
jury
has
all
of
the
federal
reports
in
there
and
the
judge
lets
them
read.
what
--
what
is
there
for
another
juror
to
say
that
this
is
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
at
--
at
--
at
least
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
jury
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
--
but
it
was
not
instructed
on
foreseeability?
