mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
case
that
presents
a
non-existent
problem
and
a
solution
that
is
in
search
of
a
non-existent
problem,
because
there
are
no
real
reported
cases
where
there
have
been
problems
arising
under
the
rogers
instructions
that
have
become
the
model
instructions
under
the
federal
rules
for
over
50
years.
and
if
could
i
just
begin,
justice
kennedy,
with
your
question
which
opened
this
up,
proximate
cause
serves
two
principal
functions.
one
is
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
persons
to
whom
the
tortfeasor
owes
a
duty;
and
the
second
is
to
limit
the
kinds
of
injuries
that
that
person
would
be
liable
for.
the
innovation
in
fela
that
is
so
important
to
understand
about
why
the
relaxed
causation
standard
became
the
accepted
standard
under
fela
was
that
fela,
by
its
plain
terms,
did
away
with
the
first
concept
of
proximate
cause
because
it
limited
the
duty
to
the
employee
by
the
employer.
there
is
no
one
outside
of
that
relationship
that
can
bring
an
action
under
fela.
and
the
second
thing
that
it
did
was
it
put
into
what
is
now
section
51
that
if
the
negligence
results
in,
quote,
"in
whole
or
in
part"
from
the
negligence
of
the
railroad,
that
is
enough
for
injury.
at
common
law
the
proximate
cause
standard
required
that
the
railroad's
negligence
be
the
sole
cause.
so
the
innovation
that
created
the
relaxation
in
the
causation
standard
was
the
inclusion
of
these
words
in
part,
and
so
over
time--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
this
court
has
rejected
that
kind
of
approach
almost
from
the
beginning
of
the
statute.
in
campbell
in
1916,
the
court
asked
whether
<fela>
[=
fela]
has
completely
eliminated
the
idea
of
proximate
cause.
the
court
has
eliminated
and
the
plain
language
precludes
the
sole
cause,
immediate
cause,
direct
cause,
last
cause,
substantial
factor--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it's
--
it's
not
one
that's
consistent
with
the
court's
cases.
and
let
me
point
you
back
to
the
day
rogers
was
decided.
if
we
accept
for
purposes
of
argument
--
and
i'm
only
accepting
it
for
these
purposes
--
that
rogers
was
only
about
multiple
causes,
on
the
very
same
day
it
decided
two
other
cases
that
arguably
were
only
about
single
causes.
it
decided
a
case
under
the
jones
act,
the
ferguson
case,
and
it
decided
another
case
under
fela,
the
webb
case.
in
both
of
those
cases,
there
were
no
multiple
causes,
there
was
no
contributory
negligence;
but
what
the
court
said
was
that
on
today
we
are
announcing
this
standard,
we
apply
that
standard
to
overturn
directed
verdicts
where
juries
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
railroad's
negligence
had
played
a
part,
even
a
slight
one,
in
producing
the
injury
sustained
by
the
worker.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--as
this
court
put
a
gloss
on
that
language
in
rogers,
it
--
it
construed
those
words
to
mean
that
the
railroad's
negligence
has
to
be
found
to
have
played
a
role,
however
slight,
in
producing
the
injury.
thus
in
mr.--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
the
railroad's
negligence
there--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
there
the
railroad's
negligence
played
no
part
in
producing
the
injury.
it's
the
producing
aspect
that
provides
a
little
bit
more--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
was
certainly
an
element
of
the
existence
of
the
condition.
but
what
the
court's
cases,
justice
scalia,
after
rogers
have
done,
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
part
of
the
history,
is
that
there
are
a
couple
of
outlier
cases,
to
be
sure.
courts
have
corrected
them
all
by
saying
that
the
judge
--
that
the
jury
could
not
have
reasonably
found
based
on
common
experience
that
this
snake
bite
or
what
have
you
was
proximately
related
to
--
played
a
part.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
scalia--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
let
me
start
with
this
by
saying
that
the
court
and
the
language
of
the
statute
have
already
eliminate
six
possibilities
for
proximate
cause;
and
the
question
now
is
whether
there's
something
additive
to
the
words
that
mr.
rothfeld
now
proposes
for
the
first
time,
because
this
was
not
language
that
they
proposed
in
their
proffered
jury
instruction,
which
can
be
found
in
the
red
brief
at
page
11.
there
they
followed
the
illinois
proposed
instruction
which
says
"natural
or
probable
sequence".
that
language
does
not
appear
in
brady.
in
brady,
a
1943
case
from
this
court,
the
words
are
used
"natural
and
probable
consequence",
a
consequence,
of
course,
being
a
result,
a
sequence
being
an
order
of
events.
now,
their
instruction
rests
on
the
word
"probable",
which
of
course
in
common
understanding
and
most
juries
would
commonly
understand,
"probable"
means
more
likely
than
not,
which
is
directly
in
contention
with
the
statutory
words
"in
part",
and
directly
contrary
to
the
way
courts
had
universally
understood
this
language
since
rogers.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
is
correct,
justice
breyer.
and
in
the
cases
--
and
there
really
are
only
a
few
cases
where
you
can
find
these
kind
of
outlier
facts
and
these
kind
of,
you
know,
fela
is
only
a
compensatory
damages
statute.
it
only
addresses
the
actual
injury
and
the
compensation
for
the
worker.
there
are
no
punitive
damages,
there
are
no
attorney's
fees,
there
are
no
treble
damages.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
negligence
theory
here,
justice
kennedy,
if
i
could
go
back
to
that,
was
not
stated
in
a
way
that
we
would
subscribe
to
by
--
by
mr.
rothfeld.
our
theory
of
negligence
at
trial
was
twofold.
one
was
that
these
wide-boded
locomotives
were
not
appropriate
for
the
switching
exercise
that
the
train
men
were
doing
on
that
day,
and
in
fact
the
supervising
engineer
said
this
was
the
only
time
that
he
was
aware
in
his
long
experience
where
these
wide-body
locomotives
were
used
for
this
specific
purpose
which
required
a
lot
of
braking
activity.
the
second
theory
of
negligence
was
that
mr.
mcbride
was
put
to
this
purpose
without
proper
training.
he
has
complained
on
the
day;
he
was
uncomfortable
and
he
didn't
know
whether
he
could
operate
that
locomotive;
and
the
jury
was
entitled
reasonably
to
infer
that
that
poor
training
was
a--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--his
--
let's
start
with
his
poor
training.
there
was
testimony
that
a
person
who
was
more
skilled
in
the
art
of
dealing
with
a
wide-boded
locomotive
would
be
able
to
manipulate
the
independent
brake
with
the
automatic
brake
in
a
way
that
would
not
cause
the
repetitive
stress
that
mr.
mcbride
suffered.
and
there
was
further
testimony
that
using
a
wide-body
locomotive,
which
is
more
difficult
to
manipulate
for
the
switching
operations,
and
here
we're
talking
about
moving
in
and
off
main
tracks
to
couple
trains,
train
cars
so
that
they
can
be
used
for
a
longer
destination
--
that
that
kind
of
equipment
was
not
suited
for
the
purpose.
mr.
mcbride's
testimony
was
when
he
had
used
the
wide-body
locomotive,
he
had
done
so
on
long
trips
over
long
distances
that
didn't
require
the
same
kind
of
ready,
manipulative
braking
of
the
independent
brake.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it's
foreseeable
if
the
railroad
is
using
a
piece
of
equipment
without
training
the
person.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
for
a
purpose
that
it's
not
ordinarily
used
for.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
didn't
ask
for
foreseeability,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
what
i
--
i
would
say
this
court--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--my
definition,
what
i
think
the
court
did
in
rogers
was
to
try
to
end
the
debate
over
how
confusing
the
word
proximate
cause
is
in
these
kind
of
cases
by
offering
simple
and
direct
instructions
that
juries
could
understand
and
apply,
and
that
has
been
the
case
over
the
last
50
years.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
would
take
the
words
of
rogers.
i
think
the
jury
here
was
properly
instructed.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
words
are
on
page
10
of
the
red
brief,
justice
scalia,
and
it
follows
the
model
form
instruction
that's
used
in
all
the
federal
courts,
"defendant
caused
or
contributed
to
plaintiff's
injury
if
defendant's
negligence
played
a
part
no
matter
how
small
in
bringing
about
the
injury.
"
"the
mere
fact
that
an
injury
occurred
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
injury
was
caused
by
negligence.
"
mr.
david
c.
frederick
whether
you
think
it's
"but
for"
or
not
i
think
is
beside
the
point.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
those
words
mean
that
"but
for"
plus
a
relaxed
form
of
legal
cause
associating
the
negligence
in
playing
a
part
in
produce
the
injury.
that's
how
rogers
understood
it.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i
would
disagree
with
that
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
the
rogers
court
disagreed
with
that
too,
because
after
rogers
this
court
upheld
in
inman
a
case
on
a
directed
verdict
where
it
concluded
after
the
rogers
instructions
had
been
used
that
nonetheless
the
negligence
of
the
railroad
had
not
played
a
part.
that's
a
case
involving
a
drunk
driver
who
hit
a
flag
man
at
the
site
of
where
the
flag
man
was
operating.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
i
think
that
the
concept
of
foreseeability
is
one
that
has
alternated
in
and
out
of
this
court's
cases,
but
let's
take
the
case
of
gallick
in
1963,
where
a
fetid
pool
with
vermin
and
rats
were
allowed
to
live
by
the
railroad's
negligence,
and
it
was
believed
that
an
insect
was
growing
--
insect
bodies
were
growing
in
that
fetid
pool,
and
as
a
result
of
that
insect
bite,
the
injured
worker's
legs
had
to
be
amputated
by
the
effect
of
this
insect
bite.
now,
many
people
would
argue
--
in
fact,
the
lower
court
had
concluded
--
that
it
was
not
reasonably
foreseeable
that
the
railroad's
negligence
in
allowing
that
stagnant
pool
to
exist
would
nonetheless
lead
to
the
injury
sustained
by
the
worker.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
but
what
the
court
had
also
done
was
to
rely
on
earlier
cases
in
which
it's
saying
these
concepts
really
are
relaxed
because
the
purpose
of
fela
is
to
provide
a
substitute,
if
you
will,
for
workers'
compensation,
where
if
you
can
establish
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
and
it
causes,
in
part,
the
injury,
the
railroad
will
be
liable
for
that.
and
that's
why
this
--
these
concepts
of
proximate
cause
really
are
getting
at
a
different
problem,
which
is
that
when
these
statutes
are
enacted,
you're
trying
to
guard
the
defendant's
liability
against
the
entire
world.
and
that's
why
it
makes
sense
to
impose
some
kind
of
restriction
for
foreseeability
or
for
directness,
because
otherwise
anybody
could
be
liable
to
anybody
else.
here,
that
problem
is
removed,
because
the
railroad
is
the
only
--
can
only
be
sued,
under
fela,
by
the
employee,
and
only
if
its
negligence
plays
a
role
in
producing
that
injury.
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
words
that
mr.
rothfeld's
trial
counsel
had
proposed,
the
"probable
sequence"
word
is
now
not
even
used
anymore
in
illinois.
so
it
would
be
very
odd
to
think
that
you
would
reverse
an
instruction
here,
where
the
proffered
instruction
by
the
railroad
doesn't
even
state
what
--
the
proximate
cause
instruction
in
the
model
language.
now
the
model
language
under
illinois
calls
for
the
natural
and
ordinary
course
of
events.
that's
how
proximate
cause
is
now
done
under
the
illinois
proposed
instructions.
and
it's
hard
to
know
how
that
language,
mr.
chief
justice,
takes
us
any
different
from
the
common
instruction
that
all
juries
are
given,
to
use
their
common
experience
and
their
common
sense
in
evaluating
the
evidence.
if
what
proximate
cause
now
means
under
these
types
of
standards
is
the
ordinary
course
of
events,
all
we're
doing
is
asking
juries
to
apply
their
common
sense
without
introducing
the
word
"proximate
cause",
which
has
been
demonstrated
to
confuse
juries
because
most
of
them,
you
know,
many
think
that
"proximate"
means
something
like
estimate
or--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
we're
delighted
with
that
concession,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
how
a
trial
judge
would
take
a
request
for
further
clarification
of
this
word's
--
this
court's
words
that
clarify
the
"resulting
in
whole
or
in
part
from.
"
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
where
anyone
challenged
the
use
of
the
rogers
language
on
the
ground
that
it
wasn't
simple
and
direct
and
therefore
couldn't
be
understood.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
--
and
i've
never
served
as
a
trial
judge,
but
i
think
my
--
my
direction
would
be
to
go
back
and
try
again
based
on
the
words
that
are
there,
because
the
whole
idea
behind
these
words
was
to
try
to
end
the
debate
between
this
court
and
many
state
courts
that
simply
didn't
grasp
that
fela
was
intended
to
provide
a
remedial
statute
with
a
causation
element
that
was
a
weaker
causation
element
than
in
normal
negligence
cases.
and
so
this
court
was
taking
dozens
of
cases
under
fela
between
the
1930's
and
the
1950's
in
which
the
court
was
looking
at
directed
verdicts
by
state
supreme
courts
that
were
overturning
jury
verdicts.
and
the
whole
idea
behind
making
this
the
language
of
what
constitutes
a
jury
case
was
to
remove
the
appellate
review
process
from
a
lot
of
these
things
and
to
leave
these
questions
up
to
the
common
sense
of
the
jury.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
the
jury
asked
a
question,
i
think
the
judge
would
write
back
and
say,
no,
that's
not
correct,
the
words
--
please
focus
on
the
words:
the
negligence
playing
a
part,
however
small,
in
producing
the
injury.
i
mean,
i'm
not
aware
if
juries
get
to
this
but
for
versus
what
is
a
relaxed--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
justice
scalia,
our
position
is
that
it
is
but-for
plus
a
relaxed
form
of
legal
cause
that's
been
well-recognized
in
the
cases
and
hasn't
produced
a
problem.
surely
the
burden
is
on
the
railroad
to
come
up
--
i
would
have
thought
that
if
they
wanted
to
overturn
the
pattern
instructions
that
have
been
used
in
nearly
a
half
a
million
cases
since
rogers
was
handed
down,
that
they
would
have
more
than
a
case
that
they
cite
from
one
of
their
amici.
i
mean,
they
don't
even
cite
the
richards
case
in
their
main
briefs.
and
so
surely
--
you
know,
we're
here
to
debate
these
hypotheticals,
i
would
suppose,
but
they
don't
have
any
relation
to
the
real
world.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
the
trial
judge
says,
no,
it
is
not
necessary
for
it
to
be
foreseeable
in
a
direct
--
if
the
negligence
plays
a
part,
however
small,
in
producing
the
injury.
and
that's
why
in
cases
like
the
ferguson
case,
which
was
decided
the
same
day
as
rogers
--
i
mean,
that's
a
very
out-there
set
of
facts,
where
the
ship
steward
--
and
remember,
what
you
decide
here
also
applies
in
the
jones
act
for
sea
workers
as
well.
but
in
that
case,
the
court
said
it
was
a
jury
question,
whether
the
failure
to
provide
an
appropriate
to
implement
to
scoop
hardened
ice
cream
from
the
freezer
on
the
ship
was
foreseeable,
whether
or
not
the
ship's
steward,
in
serving
the
ice
cream,
would
reach
for
a
butcher
knife
to
try
to
chip
away
and
lead
to
the
severing
of
two
of
his
fingers.
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
a
dangerous
situation,
justice
alito.
at
the
time
that
fela
was
enacted,
in
a
year
prior
to
that,
some
12,000
people
died
and
there
were
hundreds
of
thousands
of
injuries,
and
the
idea
behind
the
statute
was
to
provide
a
broad
remedy
so
that
rail
workers
could
be
compensated,
not
get
extra
damages
like
punitive
damages,
but
just
compensated
for
their
injuries.
and
so
the
result
is
that
railmen
know
they're
going
to
have
to
go
before
juries
exercising
their
common
sense,
and
juries
have,
in
many,
many
cases,
ruled
in
favor
of
the
railroads.
and
that
system
ought
to
be
allowed
to
continue.
if
i
could
go
back
to
one
last
point,
and
that
is
the
idea
of
statutory
stare
decisis.
we
believe
that
because
rogers
construed
the
"in
whole
or
in
part"
language,
it's
entitled
to
statutory
stare
decisis
where
jury
instructions
have
used
that
language.
and
at
some
level,
this
case
is
not
too
far
from
the
hylton
case,
which
was
decided
in
the
early
'90s,
except
the
difference
is
in
hylton,
the
court
had
dealt
with
a
case
from
the
early
1960s
called
parden.
and
that
case
had
had
many
of
the
underpinnings
of
--
of
the
question
there
that
had
been
discredited
or
undercut
by
subsequent
decisions.
here,
there
are
no
cases
since
rogers
that
suggest
doubt
on
the
general
validity
of
the
rogers
rule.
you
have
the
cases
that
were
decided
in
the
immediate
proximity
of
rogers;
you
have
gallick
in
1963--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
my
answer
to
that,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
after
rogers,
the
court
applied
the
rogers
language
to
single
cause
cases.
we
have
webb,
we
have
ferguson,
we
have
kernan,
we
have
gallick,
we
have
the
statement
in
crane
that
comparing
the
actions
of
the
nonemployee,
the
--
the
explanation
for
why
the
nonemployee
has
to
go
to
common
law
is
because
there
are
these
special
features
of
fela,
one
of
which
is
no
common
law
proximate
cause
and
the
elimination
of
contributory
negligence
and
assumption
of
the
risk.
and
then
subsequently
when
the
court
in
ayers
and
then
in
gottshall
says
very
clearly
these
are
ways
that
fela
has
departed
from
the
common
law
and
from
the
other
statutes,
in
gottshall
the
court
was
very
clear
that
it
is
relaxed
causation
and
that
this
is
one
of
the
departures
from
normal
common
law
standards.
it
would
seem
odd
to
hold
now
that
all
of
a
sudden
we're
going
to
talk
about
common
law
standards
for
causation
where
the
court
over
a
series
of
decision
over
the
last
hundred
years
has
knocked
out
six
of
the
prevailing
versions
of
proximate
cause
that
were
then
in
vogue.
that
would
be
a
very
odd
way
to
--
to
rule.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
okay,
i
would
start
with
the
language
in
rogers,
and
then
i
would
say--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--right.
in
producing
--
producing
the
injury.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
and
that
part
of
that
played
a
part
--
you
know,
rests
on
the
common
sense
of
whether
or
not
a
jury
thinks
that
a
particularly
improbable
set
of
--
of
events
is
something
that
would
be
within
the
common
experience
of
someone
to
view
as--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it's
a
relaxed
form
of
foreseeability
in
much
the
same
way.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
what
i
said
was
that
this
court's
cases
go
back
and
forth
on
the
idea
of
foreseeability
and
whether
or
not
it's
necessary.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
it's
foreseeable
here
in
this
case
that
using
the
wrong
equipment
with
the
wrong
training
would
produce
an
injury
like
the
one
that
my
client
suffered.
and
so
i
would
stand
on
that
basis,
and
i
would
further
stand
on
the
ground
that
this
court--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
right,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
jury
here
applied
the
statute
the
way
it
was
intended.
it
found
fault
with
my
client,
and
it
found
fault
with
the
railroad
and
it
apportioned
damages
accordingly.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
they
didn't
ask
for
a
foreseeability
instruction.
so,
you
know,
reversing
when
--
when
they
haven't
asked
for
the
correct
statement
of
the
law
is
not
something
this
court
ordinarily
does.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
defined
proximate
cause
by
saying
natural
or
probable
sequence,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
how
proximate
cause
was
defined
in
their
words,
and
the
way
they
defined
it
didn't
include
the
word
"foreseeability".
mr.
david
c.
frederick
probable,
though,
doesn't--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
the
word
"probable"
is
more
likely
than
not,
which
is
the
stronger
standard,
it's
intention
with
the
words
"in
part"
in
the
statute.
result
in
part
is
not
something
that
is
more
likely
than
not.
for
that
reason,
we
believe
the
court
should
adhere
to
the
rogers
approach.
it's
worked,
it's
allowed
juries
to
exercise
their
common
sense
without
being
confused
by
these
elusive
proximate
cause
formulations.
the
other
side
has
failed
to
identify
a
problem,
and
there's
not
the
slightest
reason
to
think
that
any
alternative
formulation
would
work
any
better.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
it's
--
both
theories
were
presented,
and
they
were
both
based
on
the
improper
equipment
that
he
was
asked
to
use
and
his
improper
--
improper
training
he
had
been
given,
which
are
classic
jury
questions
concerning
negligence
and
causation.
thank
you.
