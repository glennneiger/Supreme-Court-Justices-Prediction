justice
antonin
scalia
but
juries
usually
find
against
railroads
anyway,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
have
used
that
language.
you
--
you
have
not
responded
to
--
to
the
question
where
--
where
did
this
language
that
does
appear
in
our
--
in
our
cases
about
the
relaxed
standard,
where
--
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
apparently
only
fela
juries
cannot
understand
it;
all
other
juries
find
it
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
client
is
entitled
to
have
the
jury
disregard
a
proper
instruction,
right?
that's
what
you're
arguing?
justice
antonin
scalia
juries
disregard
instructions
on
probable
cause,
on
proximate
cause.
they
probably
do
it
in
non-fela
cases,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
entitled
to
have
them
disregard
the
correct
instruction
rather
than
an
incorrect
instruction,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
--
but
the
question
is,
what
was
your
argument?
what
was
your
side's
argument?
did
you
argue,
in
effect,
proximate
cause?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
other
side
says
that
what
that
meant,
and
--
and
--
and
the
language
of
our
cases
seems
to
support
that,
fela
uses
a
--
a
--
a
comparative
negligence
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
"in
whole
or
in
part"
apply
to
the
elimination
of
contributory
negligence?
isn't
that
an
adequate
explanation
for
the
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
but-for
cause
means.
tell
me
about
the
snake.
is
the
snake
covered?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you
abandon
a
proximate
cause
requirement,
however
you
want
to
define
that,
i
don't
see
why
the
snake
isn't
covered,
or
the
lightning
on
42nd
street.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure
it
did.
the
train
wouldn't
have
stopped,
the
conductor
wouldn't
have
gotten
off,
he
wouldn't
have
been
bitten
by
the
snake.
if
the
--
if
the
car
had
not
traveled
to
new
york
over
the
speed
limit,
the
--
the
passenger
wouldn't
have
been
on
42nd
street
when
the
lightning
struck.
i
mean,
how
can
you
say
it
didn't
play
a
part?
of
course
it
played
a
part.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
negligence
didn't
play
a
part?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
for
the
negligence,
the
train
would
not
have
stopped.
how
can
you
say
the
negligence
didn't
play
a
part?
had
the
train
not
stopped,
he
wouldn't
have
been
walking
along
and
been
bitten
by
the
snake.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
do
words
mean
anything?
how
can
you
possibly
say
that
negligence
didn't
play
a
part?
it
obviously
did.
it
seems
to
me
you're
arguing
for
--
not
the
nonexistence
of
proximate
cause.
nobody
in
his
right
mind
could
argue
for
the
nonexistence
of
proximate
cause.
you
are
arguing
for
some
different
--
different
definition
of
proximate
cause,
and
i
would
like
to
know
what
that
--
what
that
new
definition
is,
as
opposed
to
the
definition
that
mr.
rothfeld
proposed.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
assert
that
that's
a
foreseeable
consequence
of
the
negligence
of
using
a
wide-body
train?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
--
you
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
it
doesn't
have
to
be
foreseeable.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
you
--
you
conceded
that
it
ought
to
be
foreseeable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
trying
to
see
what
your
case
is
because
i
can't
believe
you
don't
believe
in
proximate
cause.
i
just
think
you're
--
you're
giving
a
different
definition
of
it,
and
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
your
definition
of
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
it.
i'm
still
waiting
to
hear
your
instruction,
which
is
supposedly
something
other
than
"but
for".
is
it
just
"but
for"?
justice
antonin
scalia
with
--
what
are
the
words?
give
me
the
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that's
"but
for"?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
whether
i
think.
we've
got
words
here.
what
do
those
words
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
negligence
is
a
given;
the
negligence
is
not
what
i'm
asking
about.
i'm
asking
about
causality,
and
what
you
have
just
read
is
"but
for"
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
other
side
doesn't
insist
on
that,
the
other
side
--
we'll
give
you
that
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
jury
found
it,
though.
what
--
what
would
you
tell
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
jury
found
it
unclear
and
asks
you.
what
would
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that
eliminates
but-for
cause,
to
tell
them
that
negligence
plays
a
part,
no
matter
how
small,
in
the
injury?
you
think
that
eliminates
but-for,
rather
than
invites
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sounds
like
foreseeability
you're
talking.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
no
foreseeability?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
to
go
back
or
forth?
which
do
you
want?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that
sounds
like
a
good
definition
of
foreseeable,
doesn't
it?
it's
natural
and
probable.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
something
be
natural
and
probable
and
not
foreseeable?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
true,
that
--
everything
that's
natural
and
probable
is
foreseeable,
but
not
everything
that's
foreseeable
is
natural
and
probable,
you
were
requesting
a
jury
instruction
that
didn't
go
as
far
to
help
you
as
was
possible,
but
you
were
still
requesting
a
jury
instruction
that
was
on
the
road.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
go
to
the
jury?
