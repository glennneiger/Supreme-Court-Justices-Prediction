justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
explain
how
it
might
have
made
a
difference
in
this
particular
case
based
on
the
facts
of
the
case?
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
mcbride's
theory
was
that
as
a
result
of
having
to
use
the
independent
brake
extensively
over
a
long
period
of
time
with
this
wide-bodied
cab,
his
hand
got
tired
and
it
fell,
and
it
hit
the
independent
brake.
is
that
--
that's
the
theory?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
assume
you
could
talk
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
says
to
you:
we
found
negligence,
so
we
don't
want
to
hear
about
that;
and
we've
found
but-for
causation
and
we
don't
want
to
hear
about
that;
now,
explain
to
us
why
there
isn't
proximate
cause
here?
what
more
--
what
--
what
would
you
say?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
the
jury
says,
well,
does
it
mean
that
but
for
the
negligence,
the
injury
would
not
have
occurred?
then
what
would
the
trial
judge
say?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
jury
asks,
is
it
sufficient,
is
it
necessary
for
the
injury
to
be
foreseeable?
what
does
the
trial
judge
say
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
wasn't
mr.--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--could
i
just
ask
you
this
factual
question?
was
it
mr.
mcbride's
theory
that
his
injury
resulted
from
the
repetitive
use
of
the
independent
brake
or
was
it
that
the
--
as
a
result
of
the
repetitive
use
his
hand
fell
down
and
it
hit
the
independent
brake,
and
that
was
the
cause
of
the
injury?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
--
isn't
mr.
frederick
right
in
saying
that
asking
whether
something
is
probable
is
very
different
from
asking
whether
it's
foreseeable?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
it's
probable
it's
foreseeable,
but
it
can
be
foreseeable
even
though
it's
not
probable.
