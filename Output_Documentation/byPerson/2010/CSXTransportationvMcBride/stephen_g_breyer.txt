justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
case
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
mean
somebody
might
think
that
having
to
go
off
and
patrol
a
thing
in
a
rough
area
is
something
that
happens
with
a
sudden
stop:
you
run
a
risk
of
turning
your
leg.
i
agree
with
you
about
the
snake.
is
there
any
case
about
the
snake?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
the
furthest
--
the
furthest
--
the
furthest
that
you
go
is
the
case
of
sudden
stop
in
the
wilderness,
gets
off,
rough
area,
and
twists
his
ankle.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know.
is
that
proximate
cause
or
not?
maybe
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
have
been
bitten
by
a
snake
when
you're
getting
out
of
t
car.
[laughter]
but
there
has
been
no
such
case,
to
your
knowledge?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
read
the
statute
--
as
i
read
the
statute,
it
insists,
as
interpreted
in
rogers,
that
the
negligence
has
to
play
a
part
in
producing,
and
in
the
snake
case
the
negligence
doesn't
matter.
it's
simply
the
timing,
et
cetera.
and
is
--
that's
how
i
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
guess
that's
how
courts
have
read
it.
i'm
not
sure;
you
know.
and
i
suspect
from
the
answers
i've
gotten
so
far
there's
never
been
a
court
that
read
it
differently.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
if
they
said
this,
but
i
mean,
as
i
read
it,
i
thought
the
reason
that
negligence
doesn't
play
a
part
is
the
act
which
was
negligent
played
a
part,
of
course;
it
was
"but
for";
but
the
fact
that
it
is
negligent
is
totally
irrelevant,
because
it's
not
within
the
risk
in
any
sense
whatsoever.
now
as
i
--
you
know
the
area.
i
don't
put
--
don't
just
agree
with
me
because
i'm
saying
it.
is
that
roughly
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
about
eggshell
skull?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
not
foreseeable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
just
saying,
it's
all
foreseeable,
not
foreseeable.
