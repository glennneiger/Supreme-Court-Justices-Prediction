justice
sonia
sotomayor
--can
you
tell
me
--
there
is
an
article
that
suggests
that
juries
don't
actually
understand
what
"proximate
cause"
means;
and
i
think,
and
justice
ginsburg
can
correct
me,
that
what
does
that
mean
to
a
jury
--
natural,
probable,
and
foreseeable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
the
three
phrases
different?
and
how
much
more
detail
do
you
have
to
get
in
to
describe
that
difference
in
a
comprehensible
way?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
really
suggesting
that
the
defense
attorney
here
wouldn't
have
argued
the
concept
of
proximate
cause
in
saying
the
negligence
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
just
deciding
to
hit
the
brake?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
--
i
--
i
--
it's
farfetched,
don't
you
think,
that
because
the
judge
refused
to
give
a
proximate
cause
charge
that
the
idea
of
it
wasn't
argued
to
the
jury:
what
we
did
didn't
cause
this.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
did
any
of
those
things
cause
his
injury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you've
used
the
formulation
negligence
played
a
part
in
the
injury.
so
how
did
those
things
play
a
part?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
--
can
i
go
back
a
second
and
perhaps
follow
up
justice
scalia's
question
in
a
slightly
different
way?
do
you
believe
a
railroad
can
be
held
liable
for
a
harm
it
could
not
reasonably
foresee?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
now,
perhaps,
we
can
get
to
why,
under
what
formulation,
if
it
didn't
know
harm
was
going
to
happen
or
could
happen.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
reasonably
foreseeable.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
might
not
be
reasonably
foreseeable
that
an
amputation
would
occur,
but
it
was
reasonably
foreseeable
that
some
injury
to
people
would
happen
as
a
result
of
these
infected
insect
bites,
no?
that's
what
the
court
ultimately
said.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
frederick,
go
back
again
and
tell
me
what
a
--
what
a
judge
would
say
to
a
jury
so
he
or
she
doesn't
say
but-for
is
not,
not
using
those
words,
tell
me
in
simple,
plain
language
how
a
judge
differentiates
to
a
jury
the
difference
between
but-for
and
this
causation.
what
would
a
judge
say?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
--
that
negligence
played
a
part
in
the
injury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
producing
the
injury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
not,
if
you
know
that
there
are
snakes
along
this
route,
just
like
there's
an
infected
vermin
or
insects
or
something
else?
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
it's
not
that
it's
a
matter
of
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
--
that's
right,
a
matter
of
law,
there
was
--
there
could
be
no
proximate
cause.
you're
arguing
that
a
jury
should
determine
whether
or
not
they
could
anticipate
somebody
slipping
on
a
slope?
