chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-837,
mayo
foundation
for
medical
education
and
research
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
keep
focusing,
mr.
olson,
on
--
on
this
case.
and
one
of
the
things
i
think
is
important
in
the
tax
code
is
that
you
not
have
litigation
on
different
case,
so
the
different
courts
are
coming
out
with
different
rules.
and
at
the
end
of
the
day,
you
put
one
next
to
the
other,
and
it
looks
pretty
hard
to
tell
the
difference.
so
why
doesn't
it
make
sense
simply
to
refer
to
--
to
defer
to
the
service's
interpretation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
goes
back
--
both
of
you
go
back
and
forth
with
hypotheticals,
each
of
which
sort
of
supports,
but
this
basically
a
very
familiar
situation
of
an
apprentice
who
is
both
an
employee
and
both
a
student,
and
to
try
to
draw
the
line
in
some
categorical
way
doesn't
make
sense.
the
only
way
you
can
draw
the
line
is
to
have
somebody
say:
this
is
going
to
be
the
line.
and
if
anybody
is
going
to
say
it,
it
ought
to
be
the
irs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
not
challenging
that,
are
you,
mr.
olson?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
school
said:
you
have
to
get
all
this
clinical
experience,
but
we
are
going
to
pay
you
for
the
first
two
hours
of
the
day
that
you
are
doing
that?
does
that
change
the
analysis
at
all?
you
seem
to
be
focusing
on
how
many
hours
they
are
working.
but
what
if
the
school
says:
well,
look,
we
recognize
some
of
this
is
going
to
school
and
some
of
this
is
working,
so
just
like
the
irs,
we
are
going
to
have
an
arbitrary
rule
and
we
are
going
to
say
you
are
being
paid
for
the
first
two
hours.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
looks
more
--
if
you
accept
their
classification,
it
looks
more
like
their
work
is
incidental
to
their
status
as
a
student.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
presumably,
you
would
say
it
does
if
they
don't
pay
them
anything.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
olson,
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
are
we
talking
about
national
muffler?
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
chevron
was
to
get
away
from
that
kind
of
multifactor
ad
hoc
balancing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
chevron
applies,
those
considerations
are
irrelevant,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
most
of
us
who
work
for
wages
pay
taxes
on
those
wages
under
laws
congress
has
enacted
to
collect
funds
for
social
security.
congress
has
however
exempted
from
the
social
security
taxes
students
who
work
for
a
school
where
they
are
enrolled
and
regularly
taking
classes.
the
easiest
example
is
the
college
student
who
buses
tables
in
the
dining
hall
to
earn
some
extra
money.
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
social
security
taxes
out
of
his
earnings.
this
case
however
is
not
so
easy.
it's
about
medical
residents.
these
are
doctors
who
have
graduated
from
medical
school
but
are
pursuing
additional
medical
training
to
become
certified
as
a
specialist
in
a
particular
field.
most
doctors
in
this
country
go
through
this
process.
they
largely
learn
by
working
a
lot,
50
to
80
hours
per
week,
caring
for
patients
and
performing
procedures
under
the
supervision
of
senior
residents
and
faculty
members
known
as
attending
physicians.
the
residents
get
paid
by
their
school
or
teaching
hospital
around
$50,000
a
year
and
the
school
also
pays
for
things
like
malpractice
insurance.
the
question
here
more
or
less
boils
down
to
whether
these
residents
are
workers
who
study,
so
they
have
to
pay
employment
taxes
that
other
workers
do
or
are
they
students
who
work
so
they
fall
within
the
student
exemption.
now,
the
language
that
congress
enacted
doesn't
help
very
much.
it
just
says
that
you
are
exempt
from
the
taxes
if
you
work
for
a
school
where
you
are
enrolled
and
regularly
attending
classes.
the
generality
of
that
provision
is
not
surprising.
there
are
a
lot
of
different
scenarios
that
can
come
up
and
congress
can't
be
expected
to
have
addressed
the
nuances
of
everyone.
that's
where
the
treasury
department
comes
in.
congress
delegated
to
that
department
the
authority
to
issue
regulations
implementing
the
tax
code.
now,
the
department
recently
issued
a
regulation
saying
that
if
you
work
40
hours
or
more
a
week,
they
are
going
to
consider
you
a
worker,
subject
to
the
taxes
no
matter
how
educational
or
part
of
a
formal
course
of
study
your
work
might
be.
and
the
department
helpfully
gave
an
example
of
what
it
meant
saying
that
for
example,
medical
residents
would
not
qualify
for
the
student
exemption.
the
mayo
teaching
hospital
sued.
mayo
cared
about
this
because
if
its
residents
had
to
pay
the
taxes,
mayo
as
the
employer
had
to
chip
in
as
well.
now,
in
a
case
like
this,
we
just
don't
decide
what
we
think
the
right
answer
is.
first,
we
look
at
the
law
that
congress
passed
to
see
if
it
answers
the
particular
question
before
us.
i've
already
explained
that
it
doesn't.
and
if
congress
has
given
an
agency
the
power
to
issue
rules
implementing
the
statute,
we
let
the
agency
do
just
that
and
uphold
the
agency's
view
so
long
as
it
is
reasonable
even
if
it's
not
the
same
answer
we
might
have
given
in
the
first
instance
ourselves.
so
the
question
is,
is
it
reasonable
for
the
treasury
department
to
say
that
if
you
work
in
a
job
for
more
than
40
hours
a
week,
we're
going
to
count
you
as
a
worker
even
if
that
work
is
part
of
a
program
of
study.
and
we
think
it
is
reasonable.
you
have
to
draw
the
line
according
to
some
principle.
treasury
could
have
said
we're
going
to
look
at
each
program
and
see
if
you're
really
mostly
learning
or
mostly
doing
things
you
already
know
how
to
do.
but
that
would
have
taken
the
time
of
a
lot
of
tax
department
employees
with
no
real
reason
to
think
we'd
be
any
closer
to
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at.
so
to
sum
up,
we
have
a
difficult
question
under
the
tax
code.
congress
gave
general
guidance
but
can't
be
said
to
have
answered
the
question
itself
in
the
statute.
congress
did
however
direct
an
expert
agency
to
implement
the
law
and
that
agency
has
given
a
direct
answer
to
the
question
here.
and
that
answer
is
a
reasonable
one.
we
therefore
defer
to
the
agency's
view
that
medical
residents
are
workers
who
study
not
students
who
work.
and
that
means
that
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
all
members
of
the
court
joined
the
opinion
to
that
effect,
except
justice
kagan
who
did
not
participate
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
