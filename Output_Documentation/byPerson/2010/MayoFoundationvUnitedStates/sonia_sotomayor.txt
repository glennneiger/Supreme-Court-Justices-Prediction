mr.
olson,
are
residents
supervised
their
entire
employ,
the
80
hours?
is
there
an
attending
physician
standing
over
their
shoulder
and
looking
at
what
they
are
doing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
i
--
how
i
look
at
this
case
is:
how
do
you
draw
the
line
between
a
student
who
is
working
and
a
worker
who
is
studying?
so
the
issue
for
me
is:
is
the
treasury
department's
identification
of
how
to
draw
that
line
unreasonable?
do
we
owe
them
deference?
let's
use
the
example
that's
been
floating
around
the
briefs:
the
general
counsel
of
the
university
who
takes
classes
to
increase
his
knowledge.
is
he
a
student
who
is
working
or
is
he
a
worker
who
is
studying?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
isn't
the
general
counsel
who
is
going
to,
let's
assume,
either
three
classes
a
week
or
six
hours
of
classes
is
working
40
hours
as
general
counsel,
and
he's
regularly
enrolled
in
classes.
why
isn't
he
part
of--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
why
wouldn't
common
sense
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
if
someone
is
working
40
unsupervised
hours
without
an
attending
physician
at
their
side,
taking
care
of
patients,
that
that's
really
not
a
student?
that's
what
the
treasury
department
is
saying.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
think
receiving
$50,000
or
$60,000
a
year
is
enough
to
make
you
an
employee
of
someone?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
isn't
that
--
assume
it's
not
the
general
counsel
of
the
university
but
a
lawyer
working
in
the
general
counsel's
office.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he's
being
supervised
by
the
general
counsel,
his
work's
being
reviewed,
and
he's
attending
classes
at
night.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
what
they
want
to
achieve
is
a
higher
long-term
pay,
but
they
can
go
out
and
work
as
doctors.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
understood
that
15
percent
of
the
physicians
were
not
board
certified.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
about
the
architect
residents
who
are
working
in
universities?
are
they
medical
--
like
medical
residents
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
those
five
courts
did
it
before
--
most
of
those
opinions
were
rendered
before
the
new
regulation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
only
one--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
olson--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--everyone
learns.
aren't
you
learning
today
--
sitting
here
and
watching
this
--
maybe
you
are
not
--
your
own
argument?
but
the
arguments
before
--
aren't
we
learning
in
every
case
that
we're
hearing?
i
--
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it's
--
it's,
in
my
mind,
difficult
to
separate
out
what
makes
a
person
or
stops
a
person
from
learning
on
a
job.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
at
any
job,
actually.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
opted
in,
mr.
olson,
for
the
very
reason
the
residents
might
want
to.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
have
said
that
agencies
can
clarify
situations
that
have
been
litigated
and
positions
that
they
have
lost
on.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so,
why
is
this
any
different?
