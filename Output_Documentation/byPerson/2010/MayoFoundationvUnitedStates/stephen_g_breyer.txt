is
it
--
is
it
--
the
--
the
answer
to
justice
ginsberg's
question
--
i
was
uncertain.
suppose
a
student
is
working
45
hours
a
week
in
the
grounds
department
cutting
lawns,
and
he
does
--
cutting
the
school
lawn,
and
he
earns
enough
money
to
help
his
way
through
college.
now,
i
thought,
under
this,
that
he
is
not
within
this
statute
because
it's
45
hours
and
not
40?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
it's
not.
okay.
so
--
so,
what
they're
doing
is
--
it
started
out
with
the
word
"student"
and
the
word
"service"
performed
in
the
statute.
then,
for
many,
many
years,
they
have
talked
about
the
employment,
how
it
has
to
be
incident
to
the
study.
and
"incident"
is
the
key
word.
and
so
now
what
they
have
done
is
interpret
their
own
word,
"incident",
as
saying
if
it
bulks
too
large
in
comparison
with
the
--
with
the
studying,
it's
not
incident
to
the
study.
it's
a
separate
thing.
and
that's
true
whether
it
happens
to
be
medical
school
or
it
happens
to
be
lawnmowing.
they
can't
--
they
don't
want
it
as
so
big
in
comparison
to
the
study
that
it's
not
really
part
of
trying
to
get
the
study.
it's
just
too
big.
and
they
use
the
40
for
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
if
you
are
going
to
admit
the
word
40
hours
a
week?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no
--
didn't
as
interpreted
--
it's
not
--
it's
that
--
i
concede
everything
you
say:
it's
a
total
learning
experience
and
it's
a
special
learning
experience.
the
problem
i
was
having
that
i
wanted
your
answer
to
is
that
they
have
for
many,
many
years
said:
just
because
it's
a
pure
learning
experience
and
nothing
but
a
pure
learning
experience,
you
still
can't
get
this
exemption
unless
the
work
is
incident
to
that
experience.
and
by
"incident"
we
mean
it
can't
bulk
too
large--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
respect
to
the
whole.
so
the
problem
for
you
is
not
that
it's
not
education.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
that
the
work
is
the
education.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
looked
it
up
in
the
dictionary,
and
meaning
number
one
of
"incident"
is:
an
accompanying
minor
occurrence
or
--
occurrence
or
condition.
minor.
in
other
words,
there's
the
big
thing,
and
then
there's
the
incident.
now,
if
that's
the
meaning,
well,
this
is
40.
it's
trying
to
get
at
whether
it's
minor
or
the
whole--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
that's
because
of
the
second
meaning
here.
it's
very
surprising.
i'm
found,
first,
reading
the
statute
in
the
last
case,
and
now
i
am
reading
the
dictionary.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
here
what
it
is
says
is:
something
arising
or
resulting
from
something
else
of
greater
or
principal
import.
so
they
are
trying
to
work
out,
with
that
word
"incident",
is
the
studying
of
greater
or
principal
import?
and
what
they
are
saying
is,
when
it's
40
hours
a
week,
this
other
thing,
the
studying,
is
not
of
greater
import.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rather,
it's
--
let's
say
it's
of
equal
import.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
to
draw
the
line.
