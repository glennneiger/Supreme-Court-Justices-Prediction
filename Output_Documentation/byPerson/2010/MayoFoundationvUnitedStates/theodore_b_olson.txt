mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
expressly
exempted
from
social
security
taxes
wages
paid
to
a
student
who
is
enrolled
and
regularly
attending
classes.
the
medical
residents
at
petitioner's
schools
are
enrolled
and
pursuing
a
formal
accredited
curriculum
that
has
a
rigorous
core
curriculum,
as
i
said.
hundreds
of
classes,
conferences,
lectures,
laboratory
research,
written
exams,
grades,
and
intensive,
hands-on
clinical
patient
training
under
the
supervision
of
faculty
members.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
know
whether
all
--
as
i
understand,
the
resident
program,
which
is
accredited
by
the
accreditation
council
for
graduate
medical
education,
does
involve
an
accreditation
program
which
would
probably
fit
--
where
it's
taking
place
would
probably
fit
the
definition
of
schools.
that
is
certainly
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
there
are
--
the
institutions
we
represent--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that
was
a
judgment
that
congress
made.
congress
made
the
exemption
with
respect
to
students
and
it
tied
specifically
in
to
someone
who
is
enrolled
and
regularly
attending
classes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
only
reason
i'm
hesitating,
justice
ginsberg,
is
i
don't
know
the
entire
universe
out
there.
every
program,
residents'
program,
that
has
been
involved
in
the
various
cases
that
have
discussed
this
have
been
at
schools
or
universities
or
colleges.
i
am
aware
of
no
program
that
involves
residency
and
resident
programs
accredited
by
the
acgme
that
does
not
involve
in
or
does
not
take
place
in
a
school,
university,
or
college.
so
it
could
be
something
out
there
that
i
am
not
aware
of,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
of
that
nature.
it
is
undisputed
that
these
individuals
in
these
residents'
programs
are
enrolled
and
that
they
are
regularly
attending
classes
by
various
definitions
of
the
word
"class".
the
clinical
experience
that
they
are
receiving
in
hospital
rooms,
in
lecture
halls,
in
circumstances
that
they
are
involved
in,
are
educational.
they
are
classes,
and
it
is
undisputed
--
undisputed
that
the
purpose
of
these
programs
is
to
educate
doctors
so
that
they
can
achieve
board
certification
and
hospital
privileges.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there's
two
parts
of
that
question.
the
answer
to
the
second
part
is:
of
course
not.
there
is
not
a
supervising
attending
physician
standing
over
their
shoulder
at
every
moment,
but
they
are
being
supervised
at
all
the
time
during
their
residency
program;
that
is
to
say
that
the
work
that
they
do
is
under
the
supervision,
in
that
broad
sense,
of
an
attending
physician
who
looks
over
what
they
do,
comments
on
what
they
do,
and
so
forth.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
is
--
well,
various
courts
have
considered
this,
have
found
the
statutory
provision
that
congress
has
spoken
to
the
subject,
it
has
provided
an
exemption
for
students
and
it
has
provided
its
own
limitations.
you
have
to
be
enrolled
in
regular
classes--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
internal
revenue
service
imposes
a
predominance
requirement
with
respect
to
this.
the
courts
that
have
considered
it
have
said:
this
is
not
a
question
of
law,
it
is
a
question
of
fact.
is
someone
really
a
student
or
not?
common
sense
and
common
understanding
of
the
word
"students"
would
lead
one
to
the
conclusion
of
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that
is
what
the
treasury
department
is
saying.
but
first
of
all,
you
have
to
be
an
employee
for
this
provision
to
apply
at
all.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
in
fact,
the
government
will
say
that
the
amount
of
remuneration
is
immaterial.
the
government
says
that
in
its
regulations.
the
irs
says
that,
and
it
has
said
it
for
many,
many,
many
years.
and
right
from
the
beginning,
the
amount
of
remuneration
has
no
significance
at
all.
the
fact
is,
as
every
court
that
has
considered
the
question
has
concluded,
is
that
these
residents
are
under
supervision.
you
may
be
supervised
if
someone's
not
standing
over
your
shoulder.
if
they
review
at
the
end
of
the
day
or
at
the
beginning
of
the
--
of
the
course,
what
you
have
done,
what
you
--
what
you
--
what
situations
you
have
encountered,
the
standards
that
are
being
applied--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in
the
first
place,
that
is
a
different
case.
this
is
a
refund
action
based
upon
the
situation
--
the
facts
are
on
the
ground
with
respect
to
these
residents.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
however,
that
and
the
other
parade
of
horribles
that
the
government
mentions
in
its
briefs:
what
about
the
professor
--
i
mean,
what
about
the
university
president?
what
about
the
general
counsel?
all
would
be
excluded
by
the
predominant
requirement
--
predominancy
requirement,
which
we
are
not
challenging,
which
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
and
the
government
hasn't
challenged
here.
these
individuals
cannot
achieve
what
they
need
to
achieve
for
board
certification
and
hospital
privileges
except
by
having
clinical
experience.
that
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--they
could
--
well,
very
little.
the
--
the
record
is
very,
very
clear
that
almost
in
no
cases
in
--
in
a
very,
very
narrow
circumstance
can
they
work
as
doctors.
they
won't
have
hospital
privileges.
they
won't--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
--
and
many
of
them
may
be
in
the
military
or
in
circumstances,
but
the
--
but
the
record
is
examined
by
the
various
courts
that
have
considered
it,
said
for
all
intents
and
purposes
in
the
modern
world,
that
physicians
that
are
going
to
be
treating
you
and
me
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
will
be
board
certified.
it's
an
enormous
impediment,
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
they
may
be.
i
haven't
studied
whether
an
architect,
if
they
are
in
a
school
--
congress
decided
what
this
exemption
would
cover.
it
says:
if
you
are
a
student
enrolled
in
a
school,
university,
or
a
college,
and
you
are
regularly
attending
classes,
then
you
would
be
covered.
now,
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
services
are
performed
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
an
education.
as
--
as
the
internal
revenue
service
construed
this
provision,
up
until
the
fact
that
they
lost
several
cases,
was
that
if
your
purpose
was
to
achieve
or
pursue
a
course
of
studies.
that's
the
old
regulation.
if
your--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
didn't
hear
that
last
word.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
this
--
absolutely,
that
is
true
in
this
case.
the
students
--
the
service
that
the
students
are
performing
in
hospital
rooms,
looking
at
patients,
listening
to
lectures,
working
in
laboratories,
is
a
part
of
what
they
are
getting
paid
for.
so
they
have
to
be
an
employee
to
begin
with,
in
order
for
this
exemption
to
apply.
they
have
--
it
might
be
--
it's
--
it
--
i
don't
know
whether
you
have
in
mind
someone
being
paid
for
--
by
someone
outside
the
school,
but
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
government's
got
various
categories
of
examples.
the
situation
that
you've
just
described
sort
of
falls
close
to
one
of
those
examples,
but
this
is
--
that
is
not
this
case.
the
government
would
say,
i
would
think,
that
if
you
are
a
student,
even
though
your
service
is
unrelated
to
your
education,
you
would
fall
within
the
exemption.
i
think
that's
one
of
the
examples
that
the
government
gives.
i
might
have
guessed
that
it
would
come
out
differently.
but
in
this
case,
the
purpose
for
the
service
is
education.
the
goal
of
the
service
is
education.
it's
not
to
earn
a
living.
and
--
and
it's
and
the
goal
of
the
universities
is
not
to
make
money.
it
is
to
provide--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
know
we
are
in
the
supreme
court,
but
five
courts
of
appeals
that
considered
this
said
that
the
language
is
clear.
it
does
not
admit
to
a
categorical
exclusion
of
residents
in
programs
like
this.
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
right.
and
what
the
government--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
government
having
lost
based
upon
the
words
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations
that
they
had
promulgated
that
had
to
do
with
the
goals,
the
purpose,
the
objective,
and
the
nature
of
the
activity,
lost
every
one
of
those
cases
and
said:
we
are
going
to
adopt
a
regulation
that
does
have
the
virtue
that
the
chief
justice
mentioned
of
--
of
being
categorical.
it's
the
same
as
saying,
if
you
are
left
handed,
you
are
not
going
to
be
covered
by
this
student
exemption,
or
if
you
are
only
doing
it
during
the
daytime--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--oh,
yes.
the
--
the
united
states--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--could
take
the
position--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
they
have.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
because
it's
both
arbitrary
and
it's
irrational.
if
what
the
student
is
doing,
what
the
individual
is
doing,
what
the
resident
is
doing,
is
learning
the
craft
that
he
needs
to
perform
a
doctor--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
government
is
saying
--
the
government
is
saying--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--oh,
by
the
way--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
fact
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
justices
of
this
court
are
exempt
from
social
security
taxes--
[laughter]
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
you're
okay.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
congress
--
congress
decided
to
provide
an
exemption
for
students.
and
i
want
to
address
what
justice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
--
that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
last
step
that
you
made
is
just
like
humpty
dumpty
in
lewis
carroll's
"through
the
looking
glass",
"a
word
is
what
i
say
it
is.
"
it
--
the
work
the
residents
do,
the
services
they
perform
are
all
incident
to
the
educational
process.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
goal
is
the
education,
both
from
the
standpoint
of
the
university
and
from
the
standpoint
of
the
student,
that
that
is
what
is
accomplished.
and
what
--
justice
breyer,
what
they've
said
is
because
you
are
doing
that,
the
--
the
service
is
incident
to
the
education
until
you
do
it
for
40
hours.
then
it's
no
longer
incident.
so
someone
who
may
be
a
student
under
the
--
under
the
government's
interpretation
is
a
student
until
they
work
that
40th
hour
a
week
on
a
regular
basis;
then
somehow
they
are
no
longer
a
student.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
the
fallacy
that
the
government
is
making,
that
you
have
to
either
be
a
student
or
an
employee.
that
argument
is
not
correct,
because
in
all
other
respects,
these
residents
are
employees.
the
exemption
provided
in
3121(b)(10)
does
not
come
into
play
unless
you
are
an
employee.
so
for
all
those
purposes
--
title
vii,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
so
forth
--
those
are
other
statutes
that
define
a
term
in
a
certain
way.
what
the
--
what
the
code
says
in
3121(b)(10)
--
that
you
are
an
employee,
but
if
you
are
an
employee
of
a
college
or
a
university,
and
you
are
a
student,
which
means
you
are
enrolled
in
classes
and
regularly
taking
a
program
for
the
purpose
of
education
--
then
you
don't
pay
fica
taxes.
it
doesn't
have
any
other
implication.
and
the
government's
position
in
that
respect,
and
the
argument
that's
made
in
the
other
briefs,
is
--
are
classic
red
herrings.
they
distract
from
the
real
issue.
you
don't
have
to
be
either
an
employee
or
a
student.
in
fact,
you
have
to
be
both
for
this
exemption
to
apply,
and
that
is
what
is
happening
here.
now,
again,
this
is
--
there
may
be
circumstances
where
there
might
be
something
that's
close
to
the
line
and
the
government
might
say,
"well,
you're
not
really
a
student.
"
and
the
government
really
tried
that
in
the
second
circuit,
in
the
sixth
circuit,
and
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
the
seventh
circuit.
and
in
each
one
of
those
cases,
the
court
--
and
uniformly,
all
five
circuits,
including
the
eighth
circuit
--
until
the
government
decided
to
change
the
regulation
to
say,
essentially,
residents
are
out
--
that's
basically
what
they
said.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
that's
the
whole
dichotomy
that
doesn't
exist.
the
person
is
a
student.
they
are
just
doing
it
long
and
arduously
and
they
are
doing
it
for
several
years
so
that
they
can
be
board
certified
as
good
doctors
in
their
specialty.
the
idea
that
somehow
you
are
a
student
if
you
do
it
for
39
hours,
and
if
you
do
it
for
41
hours
--
the
programs
are
rigorous.
they
--
they
have
been
designed
by
the
accreditation
programs
to
be
rigorous,
so
that
--
rigorous,
so
that
a
doctor
will
see
lots
of
patients,
do
lots
of
clinical
work,
because
that,
according
to
all
the
record
in
all
of
the
cases,
is
where
the
education
takes
place.
you
need
the
classes.
you
need
the
laboratory.
but
you
need
to
work
with
patients
doing
the
things
that
we
want
doctors
to
be
doing
with
respect
to
us
when
they
are
certified
as
a
specialist
in
neurology
or
whatever
it
might
be.
so
justice
breyer,
the
idea
that
--
this
is
a
classic
definition
of
not
only
an
arbitrary
but
a
capricious
and
irrational
regulation.
it
says
that
if
--
even
if
you
are
a
student,
you
are
doing
the
things
where
you
would
have
to
be
a
student,
and
you
are
doing
the
types
of
things
that
you
would
make
--
makes
you
a
student,
and
you
are
doing
it
for
the
purposes
that
would
make
you
for
a
student,
but
if
you
do
it
a
little
bit
too
much,
you
are
too
much
of
a
student,
and
therefore
you
are
not
a
student.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
submit
that
that
makes
no
sense
at
all.
because
if
you're
--
if
you're
studying,
and
are
doing
it
for
39
and
a
half
hours,
you
are
a
student,
and
if
you
do
it
for
40
and
a
half
hours,
all
of
a
sudden
you
are
not
doing
the
same
thing?
you
are
not
a
student?
the
incident--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
accept
the
word
"incident".
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
it
isn't.
i'm
saying,
for
purposes--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that
might
be
also.
what
we're
--
what
we're
saying
--
i
don't
--
i
am
accepting
the
word
"incident"
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
work
that's
being
done,
the
services
that
are
being
performed,
justice
alito,
are
incident
to
the
education.
they
are
a
part
of
the
educational
process.
they
are
subservient
to
the
educational
process.
in
fact,
they
make
the
educational
process.
if
i
may,
chief
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
to
the
question
that
mr.
roberts
was
addressing
with
you,
justice
ginsberg,
the
record
is
very
unclear.
in
the
eighth
circuit
residents
may
not
be
eligible
for
social
security
benefits.
it's
quite
unclear
in
the
other
circuits.
and
i
invite
your
attention
--
and
this
is
cited
in
the
briefs
--
to
20
c.f.r.
404.1028,
which
is
a
social
security
regulation.
it
says
"if
your
main
purpose
is
pursuing
a
course
of
study
rather
than
earning
a
livelihood.
"
and
it's
unquestioned
that
that
is
what
is
happening
here,
"we
consider
you
to
be
a
student,
and
your
work
is
not
considered
employment.
"
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that
may
be
what
they
do,
and
that
may
be
dependent
upon
what
happens
with
the
fica
taxes,
which
is
going
to
be
determined
--
which
has
been
determined
in
four
circuits
as
not
being
payable
with
respect
to
the
residents'
programs.
the
fact
is
that
the
government
has
taken
a
position
for
many,
many
years.
talk
about
deference
for
a
moment.
the
national
muffler
factors,
which
we
understand
still
to
be
appropriate
to
evaluate
deference
given
to
an
irs
regulation.
this
is
not
a
contemporaneous
regulation.
it
is
something
that
came
along
just
a
couple
of
years
ago.
it's
a
result-oriented
regulation.
it's
basically
saying,
we
lost
all
these
cases
on
the
facts
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
now
we
will
pronounce
that
we
will
win
these
cases,
because
we
know
all
these
residents
programs
involve
more
than--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this
is
very
different,
because
it
--
there's
--
not
of
any
change
in
circumstances
or
facts.
it
isn't
a
clarification.
it
is
a
reversal.
because
for
all
those
years,
the
government
said
we
had
this
predominance
test.
if
your
goal
is
to
pursue
a
course
of
study,
you
are
a
student.
now
the
government
is
saying,
if
your
goal
is
to
produce
a
course
of
study,
but
you
do
it
for
41
hours
a
week,
you
are
not
a
student.
it
is
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--this
is
up
to
the
court.
the
court
has
never
set
aside
national
muffler.
the
court
cited
the
national
muffler
case
in
the
cottage
savings
case,
which
is
subsequent
to
chevron.
it
cited
cottage
savings
case
in
the
boeing
case
just
a
couple
of
years
ago.
you
may
tell
me
that
the
factors
in
national
muffler
are
no
longer
something
that
you
would
apply,
but
they
are
all
sensible
factors
with
respect
to
whether
you
would
give
deference
to
a
regulation
that
pops
up
65
years
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
after
the
government
has
lost
five
cases
on
the
facts
which
are
directly
relevant
to
the
facts
here,
and
it's
a
new
regulation
and
there
has
been
no
reliance.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
you
don't
need
to
get
to
the
part
two,
because
we
submit
chevron
would
apply
and
would
stop
you
at
step
one.
the
congress
addressed
the
fact
at
issue
in
this
case,
it
said
what
students
are,
people
who
are
regularly
--
are
enrolled
and
taking
classes.
to
the
extent
you
get
to
the
second
phase,
those
factors
seem
to
be
appropriate
to
consider.
if
this
is
important,
and
if
there
is
some
anomaly
out
there,
what
the
government
should
have
done
is
turned
to
congress,
which
enacted
the
regulation
that
describes
student
and
described
what
the
limitations
were.
it
has
had
nothing
to
do
about
a
categorical
limitation
that
if
you
are
too
much
of
a
student,
you
were
not
a
student.
it
is
backwards.
if
there
is
some
anomaly,
and
if
the
government
wants
to
collect
the
funds
from
these
programs
that
it
has
really
never
collected
them
from
before,
then
it
should
turn
to
congress.
there
has
been
no
reliance
--
and
well,
the
intern
--
the
intern
anomaly,
one
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals
that
considered
that
said
it
relies
completely
on
non
sequiturs.
it
relies
for
the
interpretation
of
one
statute
with
the
repeal
of
another
statute
45
years
ago
and
draws
inference
from
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
that
which
the
repeal
took
place
one
year
after
of
the
st.
luke's
case.
the
st.
luke's
case,
the
sixth
circuit
decided
that
interns
were
not
residents,
residents
were
not
interns.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
your
honor.
