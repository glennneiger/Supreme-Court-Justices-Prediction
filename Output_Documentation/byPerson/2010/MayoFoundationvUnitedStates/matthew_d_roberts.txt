mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
fica
student
exemption
covers
individuals
who
are
predominantly
students
but
perform
incidental
employment
for
their
schools.
it
does
not
cover
petitioners'
medical
residents.
they
are
full-time
employees,
and
the
treasury
department
has
reasonably
concluded
that
an
employee's
paid
work
does
not
make
him
an
exempt
student,
even
if
he
also
learns
from
his
job.
and
that
is
true
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
text
of
the
student
exemption
makes
clear
that
it
is
not
a
broad
exclusion
for
apprenticeships
and
other
learning
jobs.
instead,
it's
a
narrow
exemption
that
applies
only
to
students
performing
services
for
a
school,
college,
or
university
where
they
are
enrolled
and
regularly
attending
classes.
and
second,
when
employees
are
working
long
hours
and
being
paid
substantial
amounts,
they
and
their
employers
should
be
helping
to
fund
the
social
security
system,
and
they
should
be
earning
credit
towards
benefits
so
that
they
and
their
families
will
have
something
to
fall
back
on
if
they
become
disabled
or
die.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's
probably
both,
your
honor,
but
it's
not
workable
to
determine
student
status
by
looking
at
a
particular
case,
whether
the
predominant
motive
or
the
motive
of
the
employee
or
the
employer
is
education.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
they
are
doing
it
for
both
reasons,
your
honor.
but
many,
many
individuals
pursue
their
jobs
for
the
primary
purpose
of
learning,
like
judicial
law
clerks,
like
other
apprentices.
but
they
are
not
included
--
they
are
not
covered
by
this
exemption.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
because
they
don't
work
at
schools,
colleges,
and
universities,
and
they,
you
know,
may
not
be
enrolled
and
regularly
attending
classes.
and
so
the
treasury
reasonably
concluded
that
because
this
isn't
a
general
exemption
for
apprenticeships,
that
they
shouldn't
construe
it
as
providing
a
special
exemption
for
apprentices
who
happen
to
be
employed
by
schools,
colleges,
and
universities.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
if
they
would
--
if
their
work
--
i
mean,
here,
basically,
they
have
work
and
the
argument
is
that
that
work
qualifies
them
as
students.
and
what
the
treasury
department
has
concluded
is
that
it's
going
to
treat
work
and
study
as
distinct
categories
in
deciding
whether
somebody
is
predominantly
a
student,
and
that
it's
not
going
to
count
the
work
as
study
even
if
there's
some
educational
component
to
it.
and
that's
reasonable
for
several
reasons,
as
i
said.
first,
because
the
statute
just
isn't
a
general
provision
that's
designed
to
cover
apprenticeships.
and
second,
because
when
people
are
primarily
workers
and
they
are
working
for
long
hours,
they
should
be
covered
and
participating
in
the
fica
system.
and
finally,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
determine
on
a
case-by-case
basis
what's
their
purpose:
what
the
employer's
purpose?
you
know,
is
this
job
more
like
study?
is
this
job
more
like
work?
and
on
that
basis
--
and
to,
on
that
basis,
decide
whether
that
should
make
them
a
student.
so
considering
all
of
those
things,
the
treasury
has
decided
to
draw
a
bright
line
and
say:
study
is
study;
work
is
work;
and
if
you
are
not
a
student
independently
of
that,
then
your
work
doesn't
make
you
a
student.
and
the
treasury
has
also
decided
that
if
you
are
working
full-time,
that
then
you
are
predominantly
an
employee
rather
than
predominantly
a
student,
and
you
are
not
covered
by
the
exemption.
in
addition,
fica's
historical
development
indicates
that
the
student
exemption
doesn't
cover
medical
residents,
because
at
the
same
time
that
congress
enacted
the
student
exemption,
it
also
enacted
a
separate
exemption
for
medical
interns,
and
it
decided
not
to
include
residents
in
that
exemption.
and
those
actions
would
have
made
little
sense
if
the
student
exemption
had
the
scope
asserted
by
petitioners.
and
then
in
1965
congress
repealed
the
intern
exemption
in
order
to
give
young
doctors
an
earlier
start
in
building
up
social
security
coverage.
and
that
repeal
also
wouldn't
have
achieved
its
purpose
if
many
and
most
residents
were
covered
--
were
excluded
from
fica
under
the
student
exemption.
these
residents
are
people.
they
are
working
between
50
and
80
hours
a
week.
they
are
working
over
a
long
period
of
time,
and
they
are
providing
critical
patient
care
with
minimal
supervision.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
the
rule
is
that
the
paid
work
doesn't
count
towards
student
status,
and
it
doesn't
count
whether
you
are
doing
it
for
4
hours,
for
10
hours,
or
for
40
hours.
so
in
a
circumstance
where
they
are
only
being
paid
--
they're
only
working
for
paid
time
for
a
certain
amount,
then
that
work
--
you
would
have
to
look--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--if
you
accept
the
classification
in
your
hypothetical
of
two
hours
and
the
other
eight
hours?
but
those
--
that
other
work
wouldn't
necessarily
qualify
as
a
course
of
study,
either,
your
honor.
i
mean,
if
what
they
are
doing
is
providing
services--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
what
the
--
treasury
regulations
define
what
a
class
is
and
what
a
course
of
study
is,
and
the
individuals
have
to
be
engaging
in
that
to
qualify
as
students
and
performing
--
giving
somebody
something
of
value.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
clinical
work
can
qualify
as
a
course
under
certain
circumstances.
but
the
clinical
work
that
medical
students
are
doing,
if
you
are
referring
to
that,
is
of
an
entirely
different
order
than
the
work--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
it's
clinical
work,
but
it's
very
different
than
the
work
that
the
residents
are
doing.
first,
there
is
the
distinction
that
the
residents
are
getting
paid
and
that
the
medical
students
are
paying
tuition.
but
secondly
from
that,
the
residents
are
providing
valuable
patient
care.
medical
students
are
primarily
participating
in
the
clinical
activities
solely
in
an
educational
capacity.
if
i
could
describe
the
different
things--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--they
are
not
getting
paid
for
it.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
might
be
a
course,
your
honor,
but
they
are
also
engaged
in
other
classes
and
other
activities
that
make
them
regularly
enrolled
and
its
part
of
a
degree
program.
so
it's
one
small
--
the
clinical
course
is
one
small
part
of
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i'm
not
resisting
the
proposition
that
clinical
work
can
constitute
a
course.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
you
are
being
paid
to
provide
services,
that
doesn't
count
as
a
course,
because
the
irs
has
decided
to
treat
work
and
study
as
distinct
categories
in
applying
this
exemption,
and
that
that's
a
perfectly
reasonable
distinction.
nothing
in
the
statute
precludes
them
from
doing
that,
and
petitioners
concede
that
it's
reasonable
to
interpret
the
statute
as
limited
to
the
individuals
that
are
predominantly
students.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not.
first
of
all,
under
the
irs's
regulation,
the
irs
defines
schools,
colleges,
and
universities
to
include
only
those
institutions
whose
primary
function
is
the
provision
of
formal
instruction.
and
second
of
all,
if
on
j.a.
27a
in
the
record
in
this
case
there
is
an
example
of
residency
programs
that
are
not
students.
one
of
the
hospitals
that
the
hennepin
county
hospital
that
has
university
of
minnesota
residents
also
has
its
own
residents,
and
just
looking
on
page
27a
if
you
have
the
j.a.,
there
is
a
question.
question,
do
the
hennepin
county
residents,
are
they
enrolled
in
any
academic
institution
that
you
are
aware?
"not
at
the
present
time".
so,
that
is
an
example
of
one,
your
honor.
and
that
does
point
out
an
anomaly
about
petitioner's
interpretation
of
the
exemption,
medical
residents
who
work
for
hospitals
that
are
operated
by
schools,
colleges
and
universities
would
be
exempt
from
fica
tax,
but
residents
who
work
for
other
hospitals
wouldn't
be
exempt,
even
though
their
work
is
equally
educational.
that
is
just
an
illustration
of
the
broader
principle
that
this
isn't
an
apprenticeship
exemption,
and
that's
why
--
because
of
that
the
treasury
has
taken
this
approach
to
the
situation
where
people
are
learning
on
the
job.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
there's
no
--
there's
no
question,
your
honor.
it's
always
been
the
social
security
administration's
position
that
medical
residents
are
not
students
exempt
from
the
social
security
act.
the
social
security
administration
stated
that
in
a
social
security
ruling
as
far
as
back
as
1978,
and
they
continue
to
adhere
to
that
position.
in
addition,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
way
the
social
security
administration
determines
whether
people
get
coverage
for
a
particular
period
under
the
social
security
act
is
they
look
at
the
w-2's
that
come
in.
and
if
fica
tax
has
been
paid,
then
they
put
them
down
as
being
covered
under
the
social
security
act.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
it
works
that
way
as
well.
as
i
said
before,
these
workers
who
are
working
between
50
and
80
hours
a
week
over
many
years
for
substantial
salaries,
are
precisely
the
kind
of
workers
whose
employers
should
be
supporting
the
social
security
system
and
who
should
be
earning
credit
towards
disability
and
survivor
benefits.
and
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
