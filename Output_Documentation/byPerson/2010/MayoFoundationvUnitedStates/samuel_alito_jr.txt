alito,

why
do
you
accept
the
word
"incident"?
incident
is
not
in
the
statute.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
isn't
the
answer
that
the
--
that
the
noneducational
aspect
of
the
service
has
to
be
incidental
to
what
they
are
doing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
question
is
whether
someone
is
predominantly
a
student
or
an
employee,
why
shouldn't
we
ask:
why
are
they
enrolled
in
this
program,
and
why
is
the
institution
enrolling
them
in
the
program?
why
are
residents
enrolled
in
the
program?
are
they
enrolled
in
the
program
to
make
money
or
are
they
enrolled
in
the
program
either
because
it's
a
licensing
hurdle
they
have
to
clear
or
they
want
additional
education,
and
why
is
the
institution
hiring
them?
is
the
institution
hiring
them
to
get
the
value
of
their
services
or
is
it
hiring
them
for
educational
purposes?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
general,
why
are
residents
--
why
do
medical
school
graduates
become
residents?
are
they
doing
that
because
they
want
to
earn
the
40
to
$50,000
a
year
that
they
are
paid
or
are
they
doing
it
for
some
other
reason?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
on
average
they
were
paid
$10,000
a
year?
would
it
be
the
same?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i
thought
clinical
work
couldn't
qualify
as
a
course.
is
that
wrong?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
now
have
a
lot
of
briefs
--
we
now
have
a
lot
of
briefs
filed
in
this
court
in
which
a
lot
of
the
work
is
done
by
students
in
law
school.
i
assume
they
are
getting
credit
for
that.
is
that
not
a
course?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
is
it
a
course?
is
it
not
a
course?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
that.
i
am
questioning
why
you
are
resisting
the
proposition
that
clinical
work
can
constitute
a
course.
