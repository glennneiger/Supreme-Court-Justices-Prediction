mr.
olson,
are
all
institutions
that
employ
residents
schools?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
might
be
relevant,
because
it
would
be
unseemly,
perhaps,
to
have
residents
who
are
not
working
at,
quote,
fica
tax,
and
other
residents
whose
training
is
approximately
the
same
escape
the
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
can't
give
me
the
reality
there.
are
all
resident
programs
conducted
in
schools
or
are
there
resident
programs
that
would
not
qualify
because
they
take
place
in
institutions
that
are
not
schools?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
why
not
read
that
provision
--
now
we
are
going
to
the
statute
--
if
such
service
is
performed
by
a
student,
et
cetera,
as
saying:
well,
this
student
status
and
the
service
is
distinct
from
the
student
status?
take
the
typical
work/study
program
in
a
college.
that
would
seem
to
fit
this
language
to
a
tee.
there
is
a
student
and
the
student
is
working
part
time,
but
you
are
--
there
--
there
is
no
independent
significance
to
this
term
"student"
as
you
read
the
text;
that
is,
the
student
and
the
services
are
all
together.
it's
not,
"i
am
a
student
here
and
i
perform
services
there.
"
it's
--
the
student
is
--
the
education
is
the
service.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
this
fit
the
work/study
student
who
is
studying
philosophy
and
then
he's
working
in
the,
say,
speech
department?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
what
came
into
my
mind
when
i
read
these
words
was
a
work/study
program,
where
the
student
is
studying
and
that
--
the
status
is
student.
the
work
is
separate
from
that.
it's
not
necessarily
to
advance
the
person's
education.
it's
to
give
the
student
some
money.
so
that's
what
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
this
was
--
this
was
describing
student
status,
okay?
and
the
student
is
also
working
for
some
money.
but
you
seem
to
say
that
the
service
--
that
--
that
it
--
the
student
status
is
not
independent
from
the
service.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
have
in
mind
the
typical
work/study
program.
the
--
the
student
signs
up
for
work/study
and
may
be
assigned
to
work
in
the
administration,
helping
out
with
clerical
things
there,
but
the
student
status
is
one
thing,
services
are
another.
now,
that,
i
assume,
would
be
covered,
that
the
earnings
of
the
student
in
the
work/study
program
would
not
be
subject
to
fica?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
there
has
been
a
concern
expressed
that
if
we
accept
your
position
that
residents
are
students,
it
will
have
ramifications
for
other
areas
of
the
law,
notably,
the
national
labor
relations
act.
suppose
the
residents
wanted
to
organize
and
collectively
bargain.
if
they
are
students,
they
can't
do
that.
and
let's
take
the
title
vii
and
the
other
antidiscrimination
in
employment
statutes.
if
they
are
not
employed,
if
they
are
students
rather
than
employees,
then
they
wouldn't
be
covered
by
that
legislation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
they
don't
work
at
schools.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
certainly
--
they
can
be
a
student
in
the
last
year
of
medical
school
and
then
they
are
doing
intern-level
work.
that
is
--
that
is
clinical
programs
where
they
would
be
categorized
as
students.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
do
you
know
the
answer
to
the
question
i
asked
mr.
olson;
that
is:
are
all
resident
programs
schools?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
the
petitioner's
brief
says
twice
that
there
is
some
question.
assuming
that
we
hold
that
the
--
the
residents
are
subject
to
the
fica
tax,
there
is
some
question
whether
even
if
they
had
to
pay
their
tax,
whether
they
would
be
eligible
to
receive
social
security
benefits
or
i
take
it
credit
for
full-time
employment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
you
are
not
taking
issue
with
what
mr.
roberts
has
said?
that
is,
in
practice
the
social
security
looks
to
see
--
they
look
at
the
w-2,
see
that
the
fica
tax
was
paid,
and
if
it
was,
then
--
then
they
get
credit
for
social
security.
