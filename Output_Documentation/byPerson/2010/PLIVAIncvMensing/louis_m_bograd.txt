mr.
louis
m.
bograd
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
that
petitioners,
in
the
face
of
considerable
information
that
the
warnings
on
their
products
were
inadequate,
did
nothing.
the
generic
drug
companies'
position
is
that
they
--
no
matter
how
much
they
know,
no
matter
how
grave
the
risk,
they
are
under
no
obligation
to
do
anything
to
warn
of
the
dangers
of
the
products
they
sell.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
they're
obliged
under--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
correct.
what
this
court
said
in
wyeth
v.
levine
is
that
state
juries
are
a
perfectly
appropriate
vehicle
for
assessing
whether
warnings
in
the
past
were
adequately
given.
we
do
--
we
do
not
dispute
that
the
issue
about
what
language
will
be
on
a
label
going
forward
rests
with
the
agency.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
no,
it's
not,
justice
scalia.
the
--
as
petitioners
concede
in
the
brief,
under
traditional
state
law
failure
to
warn
claim,
our
affirmative
case
is
that
the
warnings
that
were
given
to
the
doctor
and
to
the
patient
were
inadequate,
and
that
because
adequate
warnings
weren't
given,
the
patient
was
injured.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
your
honor--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--your
honor--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--no,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
once
the
fda
said
no,
we
would
have
clear
evidence
that
the
fda
would
have
rejected
the
warning--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--which
is
what
this
court
said
in
levine
is
the
touchstone.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
yes,
your
honor,
for
purposes
of
impossibility.
in
order
for
the
--
preemption
is
an
affirmative
defense,
and
for
the
defendants
to
establish
that
it
was
impossible,
i.e.,
that
the
duties
under
state
and
federal
law
were
in
direct
conflict,
they
have
to
show
that
the
fda
would
have
rejected--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--well--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--well,
there
are
two
answers,
your
honor.
first
--
first,
this
court's
decision
in
levine
is
inconsistent
with
that
sweeping
reading--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--yes.
i'm
sorry,
i--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--your
honor,
let
me
respond
to
that
in
--
in
two
ways.
first--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--i
--
i
will,
your
honor.
the
--
to
focus
first
on
the
cbe
issue,
one
of
the
things
this
court
noted
in
levine
is
that
even
under
the
cbe
process,
the
ultimate
decision
about
whether
the
labeling
is
changed
rests
with
the
fda,
not
with
the
manufacturer.
the
--
the
fundamental
issue
in
levine
was
that
the
primary
responsibility
for
labeling
rested
with
the
manufacturer,
not
with
the
agency,
subject
to
the
agency's
review.
and
we
don't
dispute
that
the
agency
has
the
right
to
review
and
can
reject
a
label.
the
--
what
was
at
the
core
and
what
this
court
cited,
although
the
--
the
number
has
changed
in
wyeth
v.
levine,
is
the
obligation
under
21
cfr
201.57(e),
which
you
call
201.80(e)
because
they
--
they
renumbered
it
--
that
the
label
warnings
shall
be
revised
as
soon
as
there's
reasonable
evidence
of
an
association
of
a
serious
hazard
with
the
drug.
the
government
says,
and
the
regulatory
structure
makes
clear,
that
that
provision
applies
with
full
force
to
generic
drug
manufacturers,
not
just
to
name-brand
drug
manufacturers.
it
is
the
regulatory
implementation
of
the
obligation
under
the
federal
misbranding
statute,
21
u.s.c.
352(f)(2)
that
says
you
can't
sell
a
drug
that
doesn't
have
adequate
warnings
about
its
risks.
so,
when
you're
--
when
the
manufacturer
is
confronted
with
information
that
the
warnings
on
its
drug
are
not
adequate,
it
--
the
way
it
--
the
way
it
should
respond
is
by
immediately
going
to
the
fda
and
saying
to
the
agency:
we
have
this
new
information;
we
ask
you,
not
that
we
want
a
different
warning
from
the
name
brand,
but
we
ask
you
to
approve
a
stronger
warning
on
both
the
name-brand
product
and
its
generic
equivalents.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
and
had
they
done
so,
we
would
know
--
one
of
two
things
would
have
happened.
either
the
agency
would
have
approved
the
warning,
stronger
warnings
would
have
been
given
and
our
clients
--
my
clients
likely
would
not
have
been
injured;
or
they
would
have
said,
no,
we
don't
think
there's
sufficient
information
to
justify
this
warning.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
your
honor,
as
you
just
heard
from
mr.
lefkowitz,
generic
manufacturers
typically
haven't
been
fulfilling
this
obligation
and
have
not
been
asking
the
agency.
but
the
latest
data
from
the
agency,
and
this
is
from
its
--
its
web
site,
is
that
under
--
they've
been
publishing
performance
data
since
2007,
and
they
now
say
that
safety
labeling
changes,
which
are
the
labeling
changes
required
under
fd
--
under
fda,
are
processed
typically
in
a
matter
of
months,
94
percent
within
3
months.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
they're
--
they
are
--
they
could
be
ones
submitted
by
generic
manufacturers.
those
are
ones
where
the
information
that
comes
to
the
agency
triggers
a
--
a
labeling
revision
process.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
i'm
sorry,
what
was
that?
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
your
honor,
my
understanding
--
there
were
certainly
procedures
available
that
would
have
required
an
up-or-down:
the
citizens
petition
process,
for
example,
the
supplement
process,
for
example.
the
--
what
--
the
government
has
represented
that
even
if
the
request
came
in
a
more
informal
form,
the
government
would
nevertheless
take
a
request
for
a
--
a
labeling
change
to
reflect
a
serious
inadequacy
in
label
warning
seriously
and
act
on
it
promptly.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
no,
your
honor,
these
are
--
these
are
actually--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--i
--
they
could
be
--
they
could
be
from
name-brand
companies;
they
could
be
from
private
citizens.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
it's
whenever
the
agency
becomes
aware
of
information.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
but
the
agency
also
processes
supplement
requests,
according
to
its
web
site,
in
97
percent
of
the
cases
or
something,
within
4
months.
it's
not
--
it's
--
it
is
a
matter
of
months,
not
--
not
years.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
uh-huh.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
well,
under
most
--
under
the
law
of
most
states,
and
this
is
true
in
both
louisiana
and
minnesota,
there
is
a
reasonableness
element
in
a
failure
to
warn
claim,
but
it's
--
the
standard
is
"knew
or
should
have
known",
so
that
the
manufacturer
--
manufacturers
are
typically
held
to
the
--
to
the
knowledge
of
an
expert
in
the
field
of
the
products
they
manufacture.
and
here
the
--
our
contention
has
been
that
if
the
generic
manufacturers
had
merely
examined
the
publicly
available
fda
database
of
adverse
event
reports,
and
merely
paid
attention
to
reports
in
the
published
literature
that
had
since
19
--
the
early
1990s
had
documented
a
serious
association
between
long-term
use
of
metoclopramide
and
tardive
dyskinesia,
they
would
have
had
more
than
sufficient
information
to
say
to
the
agency,
we
need
a
change
here.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
under
state
law,
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
it
means--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--that's
incorrect,
your
honor.
they
have
to
be--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--they
have
to
remain
informed
of
the
dangers
posed
by
the
products
they
sell.
they
have
obligations--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--well,
your
honor,
one
of
their
obligations
under
federal
law
is
to
go
to
the
agency
every
year
and
identify
significant
new
information
that
would
affect
the
safety
or
efficacy
or
labeling
of
their
product,
which
means
they
have
to
have
the
capacity
to
evaluate
information
that
is
out
there,
and
that--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
in
this
particular
context
we're
talking
about
a
use
that
was
never
approved
by
the
fda.
we're
talking
about
use
beyond
12
weeks,
which
had
never
been
evaluated.
so
there's
really
no
basis
to
assume
that
the
name-brand
manufacturer
here
had
any
more
expertise--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
it
has
an
obligation
under
201.57(e)
to
initiate
a
label
change--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--process
whenever
it
has
reasonable--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--all
right.
if
we
--
we
were
talking
about--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--oh,
that's
--
that's
incorrect,
justice
breyer.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
it's
--
well,
as
this
court
said
in
levine,
the
fda
has
11,000
drugs
it
needs
to
monitor
and
stay
on
top
of,
and
it
doesn't
have
the
resources
necessary
to
pay
attention
to
every
adverse
event
report
it
gets
and
every
report
that
is
published
in
the
scientific
literature.
the
reason
that
manufacturers
bear
the
primary
responsibility
is
because
they
--
they
need
to
trigger
the
fda's
focus
on
a
particular
issue
here.
here
this
information
was
available
since
the
mid
'90s.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
exactly,
your
honor.
their
obligation
--
their
obligation
under
state
law
is
to
provide
a
warning.
what
they
should
have
done,
and
if
you
take
--
what
they
should
have
done
is
go
to
the
fda
and
ask
the
fda
to
approve
a
stronger
warning.
if
the
fda
had
said
no,
they
would
have
a
preemption.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
i
--
i
don't
have
an
immediate
answer
to
that,
justice
alito.
the
--
the
--
the
state
--
the
--
i
--
the
question
is
whether
there
would
be
a
direct
conflict
between
state
and
federal
law.
it
seems
to
me
unless
--
i'm
sorry.
oh,
that's
the
5
minute
light.
unless
the--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--my
--
my
theory
leads
to
the
--
to
the
proposition
that,
unless
federal
law
precludes
them
from
--
from
going
to
the
process
of
strengthening
their
warning
label,
then
the
state
may
legitimately
enforce
its
obligation
to
protect
its
citizens'
health
and
safety.
i
think
it's
important
in
this
regard--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--justice
alito,
well,
as
you
know,
we
disagree
with
the
government
about
whether
certain
formal
processes
were
available.
but--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--but
assuming
--
but
--
but
if
we're
talking
--
but
there
may
not
be
a
formal
process,
but
there
is
a
formal
obligation,
both
under
statute,
not
to
sell
a
misbranded
drug,
and
under
regulation,
to
revise
your
labeling
as
soon
as
there's
reasonable
evidence
of
an
association
of
a
serious
hazard
with
the
drug.
and
i
think
it's--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--because,
your
honor,
this
is
--
and
i
should
start
by
saying
that
in
buckman
there
was
--
the
suit
was
not
against
the
manufacturer;
the
suit
in
buckman
was
against
a
consultant
that
--
that
helped
the
manufacturer
get
fda
approval.
there
was
a
separate
product
liability
action
against
the
manufacturer
that
had
already
been
litigated
and
settled.
the
--
buckman
said:
we're
not
talking
about
traditional
causes
of
action,
state
law
causes
of
action
like
in
lohr,
or
like
in
--
or
as
this
court
again
said
in
wyeth
v.
levine;
we're
talking
about
a
case
where
the
whole
centrality
of
the
claim
is
premised
on
the
relationship
between
the
company
--
or
the
defendant
and
the
agency.
this
is
not
that
case.
we're
--
this
case
is
about
the
--
the
duty
that
the
company
owes
to
my
clients
and
their
doctors
to
provide
them
with
adequate
warnings.
that
duty,
which
is
--
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
innumerable
times,
complements
the
fda
statutory
scheme
by
creating
incentives
for
companies
like
the
petitioners
to--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--but--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
a
fortiori
point
in
this
context,
your
honor.
but
in
buckman
there
was
no
relationship
whatsoever
between
the
consultant,
the
buckman
company,
and
the
injured
person.
the
buckman
company's
dealing
were
--
had
been
exclusively
with
the
agency.
they
had
had
no
dealing
whatsoever
--
they
had
not
failed
to
warn.
that's
why
we
--
the
plaintiffs
had
created
this
bizarre
cause
of
action,
and
it's
--
we
think
it's
a
wholly
distinguishable
case.
i
think
it's
important
to
remember,
first
off,
the
world
in
which
we
live
today.
70
percent
of
all
prescriptions
are
filled
with
generic
drugs.
a
third
of
generic
drugs
no
longer
have
name-brand
competitors
at
all,
because
the
economic
--
because
the
name
brands
have
withdrawn
from
the
market,
so
that--
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
--somebody
has
been
appointed
to
be
the
reference-listed
drug.
they
have
not
been
appointed
to
have
obligations
distinct
from
the
other
generic
companies
as
far
as
updating
label
claims.
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
i
--
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
question
better
directed
to
mr.
kneedler,
but
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
believe
that
there's
a
--
there's
a
difference.
any
--
we
have
a
system
today
where
every
state
has
a
drug
substitution
law
that
drives
prescriptions
to
be
filled
with
generics
rather
than
name-brand
products.
we
have
a
system
where
medicare,
medicaid,
and
insurers
force
or
encourage
the
substitution
of
generics
through
--
through
price
incentives.
if
generics
are
not
responsible,
in
many
of
these
cases
no
one
is
responsible.
the
--
we
--
the
position
that
the
generics
are
proposing
here
is
one
in
which
they
would
be
immune
from
liability
for
selling
a
product
with
inadequate
warnings,
even
though
the
name-brand
company
selling
the
same
drug
with
the
same
warnings
would
be
liable.
there
is
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
the
record,
your
honor,
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
text
of
hatch-waxman
or
in
fda
regulations
that
that
distinction
was
ever
contemplated
by
congress,
that
it
was
ever
sanctioned
by
the
fda.
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
point,
your
honor.
in
bates
--
and
i
apologize;
we
didn't
address
this
specifically
in
our
briefs,
because
i
didn't
notice
it
until
later
--
the
statutory
scheme
at
issue
in
bates,
under
fifra,
was
almost
identical
to
the
--
i'm
sorry.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
may
i
finish
my
point,
your
honor?
mr.
louis
m.
bograd
there
was
no
cbe
equivalent
in
bates
in
the
--
under
the
fifra
statutory
scheme,
and
yet
this
court
upheld
against
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
preemption
grounds
a
failure
to
warn
claim,
admittedly
under
an
express
preemption
provision.
this
court
upheld
a
claim
against
a
pesticide
manufacturer
even
though
the
pesticide
manufacturer
could
not
have
changed
its
warning
without
prior
epa
approval,
exactly
the
same
situation
that
confronts
the
generics
here.
thank
you,
your
honor.
