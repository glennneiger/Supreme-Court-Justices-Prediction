justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
call
this
the
take
steps
--
is
this
the
take-steps
doctrine,
for
purposes
of
discussion
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
you
say
that
that
is
preempted
or
just
that
it
was
not
well-pled.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
of
your
position
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
--
is
there
any
breakdown
as
to
how
many
of
those
requests
are
generic
and
how
many
from
branded?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
buckman
was
a
case
--
i'm
pronouncing
it
right,
i
think,
buckman
--
where
it
was
a
branded
manufacturer,
was
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
medical
device
manufacturer.
so
there
it
was
--
it
was
an
fda
process,
and
we
said
there's
no
state
cause
of
action
for
saying
that
the
fda
process
--
that's
slightly
different
from
saying
that
you
have
a
duty
to
warn
the
fda.
you
might
say
it's
a
fortiori.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
--
does
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
is
your
--
what
is
your
explanation
for
why
buckman
isn't
applicable
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
suit
was
brought
by
the
injured
person
in
buckman.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
similar
in
that
respect.
and
in
buckman
there
was
a
--
a
formal
relationship
which
did
not
permit
the
cause
of
action,
and
it
seems
to
me
you
could
at
least
argue
that
a
fortiori
there
should
be
no
cause
of
action
when
there
an
informal
relationship.
