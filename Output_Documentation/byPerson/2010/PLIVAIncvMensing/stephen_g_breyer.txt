justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
are
you
supposed
to
do
if
your
company
happens
by
chance
to
come
across
a
very,
very
high
correlation
between
people
who
take
your
generic
drug
and
who
get
seriously
ill?
and
now
what
you
know
is
that
nobody
else
has
really
found
that,
but,
my
goodness,
there
you
are;
it
happened
that
it
was
associated,
a
special
group
or
something.
what
are
you
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
are
they
saying
that
you
--
is
it
conceded
in
this
case
that
you
did
tell
the
fda
everything
you
knew
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
is
that
a
point
in
dispute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
would
it
conflict?
suppose
the
state
said:
here
is
what
we
want;
we
notice
that
it
says
in
the
federal
law
that
you
must
keep
your
warnings
up
to
date,
and
if
you
find
an
association,
you
must
revise
your
warning.
now,
we
understand
you
can't
do
that
without
fda
approval.
but
as
far
as
our
state
is
concerned,
we
think
that
when
you
come
across
this
serious
problem
you
have
to
tell
the
fda
in
some
form
or
other,
a
reasonable
form,
about
it.
would
that
law
--
is
there
anything
federal
that
that
law
would
conflict
with?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i
wonder
--
see,
i
wonder
if
that's
this
case.
i
wonder
if
this
case
is
what
they're
saying
is:
oh,
we
concede
you
told
the
fda
every
single
thing,
so
they
were
just
as
informed
as
you
are
about
the
risks
here,
but
you
did
not
add
the
words:
and
please
change
our
--
your
permission,
so
that
we
can
change
the
warning.
is
that
what
this
case
is
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
they
come
up
here
they
might
say
this
isn't
just
what
this
case
is
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
argument
is
that
if
we
run
across
this
tremendous,
really
serious
--
i
can
make
an
imaginary
as
serious
as
you
want
--
really
a
serious
problem,
and
you're
saying
the
state
has
no
right
to
say
--
even
if
we
purposely
didn't
tell
anybody,
they
can't
get
involved
because
they
can't
get
involved
with
our
failure
to
tell
the
fda
anything
because
that's
federal,
and
we
can't
--
they
can't
get
involved
with
our
failure
to
try
to
change
the
warning
because
that's
taken
care
of
by
our
obligation
to
tell
them,
which
we
didn't
fulfill?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
appears
also
that
the
--
it's
buckman,
it
seems
to
me,
the
relevant
case,
not
wyeth,
because
what
--
if
--
you're
now
saying,
i've
learned,
that
--
that
they
have
a
set
of
fda
duties;
they
must
tell
the
fda
every
detail.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
sounds
awfully
familiar
to
buckman,
where
the
state
claim
was
basically
a
claim
of
fraud
on
the
fda.
and
we
said
it's
not
up
to
the
state
to
--
to
--
they
can't
bring
--
have
a
claim
for
fraud
on
the
fda.
the
fda
has
to
enforce
their
own
stuff.
and
why
isn't
the
same
true
here,
that
the
fda
has
to
enforce
their
own
legal
requirement
to
tell
us
everything
you
know?
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
because
levine
involves
the
wyeth
case,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
--
the
difference
there
is
the
difference
that
the
sg
points
out:
there
is
a
broad-ranging
obligation
for
the
initial
drugmaker
to
tell
the
fda
all
kinds
of
things
and
change
the
warnings.
but
here
the
fda
tells
us
they
have
no
power
to
change
their
warnings.
they
can't,
unlike
levine.
they
have
to
copy
the
original
maker.
so
--
i'm
--
i'm
just
referring
there
to
the
whole
sg
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
be
sure
you
answer,
please,
my
original
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
they
had.
suppose
that
--
is
a
generic
required
to
file
adverse
incident
reports?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
imagine
a
company
that
files
every
adverse
incident
report,
complies
completely;
period.
now,
in
your
view
does
it
have
an
additional
obligation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
their
argument
is
that
in
respect
to
their
failure
to
do
the
first,
that's
buckman.
that
is
similar
to
buckman.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now.
and
that's
what
i
--
now,
as
to
the
second,
it
just
doesn't
add
anything.
the
fda
has
all
that
information.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
why
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
basic
argument,
i'm
getting
this
now,
that
--
i
think
--
is
that
the
failure
is,
where
state
law
has
a
right
to
enter,
is
to
require
them
to
keep
track
of
adverse
incidents
and
other
things
in
the
--
and
do
their
best
to
change
the
label,
which
will
consist
of
going
to
the
fda,
likely,
and
asking
them
to
change.
