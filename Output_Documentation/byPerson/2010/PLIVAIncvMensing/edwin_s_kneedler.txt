mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
hatch-waxman
amendments
were
designed
to
facilitate
the
entry
of
generic
drugs
onto
the
market.
they
do
not
absolve
a
manufacturer
of
his
responsibilities
after
entry
onto
the
market
to
maintain
the
safety
of
the
drug
and
the
adequacy
of
--
of
the
label.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
we
do,
because
the
ultimate
question
in
the
preemption
case
is
whether
there's
a
conflict.
and
if
the
--
if
the
manufacturer
has
an
opportunity
to
come
to
fda,
even
if
--
even
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
it
didn't
have
an
obligation
to
do
so,
if
it
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so
and
did
nothing
when
--
when
dramatic
evidence,
you
know,
by
hypothesis,
came
to
its
attention,
it
wasn't
prohibited
from
doing
so.
there
was
no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
--
the
fdca
does
not
regulate
the
responsibilities
of
physicians
in
those
situations.
the
whole
point
of
the
labeling--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
think
state
law
would
--
would
impose
an
obligation
on
the
physician
to
adequately
advise
the
patient,
but
what's
so
different
is,
the
physician
relies
upon
the
labeling.
if
the
physician
has
the
information,
the
physician,
on
his
own
initiative,
could
tell
the
patient
or
warn
the
patient
about
what's
going
on
without
--
without
having
to
go
to
fda
at
all.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
several
things.
the
manufacturer
does,
of
course,
have
the
obligation
to
furnish
the
adverse
event
information
that
it
receives.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
if
--
if
the
standard
in
regulation
57(e)
is
met,
where
there's
evidence,
reasonable
evidence,
of
a
serious
hazard,
it
has
an
obligation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
they
are
--
they
are
to
propose
--
in
our
view,
are
to
propose
a
labeling
change,
which
means
that
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
and
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
it
will
lead
to
a
flood
of
such
requirements
in
the
wake
of
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
the
--
if
fda
rejected
the
request,
there
would
--
there
would
be
preemption,
because
fda
--
it
would
have
been
submitted
to
the
expert
agency,
as
we
think
is
required.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
i
--
i
don't
think
in
every
case.
i
think
it's
--
if
--
but
here,
here
we
have
a
situation
where,
at
least
according
to
the
allegations,
there
were
published
studies
of
long-term
use
of
this
product.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
not
just
boilerplate
evidence
at
the
bottom
of
the
--
as
part
of
a
letter.
what
the
--
what
the
federal
register
notice
told
the
manufacturer
to
do
was
to
--
was
to
submit
the
proposal
to
fda
with
supporting
information.
in
other
words,
suppose
it's
the
sort
of
submission
that
would
--
that
would
be
like--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
--
i
think,
to
put
it
in
context,
these
were
the
regulations
actually
implementing
the
hatch-waxman
statute,
and
there
was
a
proposal
to
allow
the
manufacturers
to
deviate
from
the
--
from
the
nda
holders'
label
and
put
their
own
on
it.
and
the
--
and
fda
said,
no,
you
can't
do
that,
but
what
you
should
do
is
bring
it
to
fda,
and
fda
will
decide
whether
to
change
the
labels
for
everyone.
and
so
this
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
notice
and
comment
rulemaking:
how
should
--
how
should
a
generic
manufacturer
deal
with
a
situation
where
it
has
information
that
may
deviate
from
the
nda
holder's
--
how
should
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
my
knowledge,
fda
has
not
done
an
analysis.
but
it's
important
to
understand
the
duty
here
derives
from
the
misbranding
provisions.
a
generic
drug
manufacturer
is
not
exempt
from
the
misbranding
requirements
of
the
act,
which
prohibit
distributing
a
drug
that
does
not
have
adequate
--
adequate
warnings,
and
rule
57(e)
requiring
a
manufacturer
to
propose
a
warning
or
to
make
a
warning
change
if
there
is
evidence
of
a
serious
hazard
implements
that
misbranding
requirement.
so
this
is
not
an
imposition
by
fda.
this
is
an
underlying
requirement
of
the
act.
i
would--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--state--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
--
the
fda
regulations
do
not
explicitly
require
monitoring
of
literature,
but
--
but
there's
no
conflict
in
state
law
imposing
a
duty
to
do
that.
if
i
--
if
i
may
just
discuss
buckman
for
a
minute,
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
the
standard--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
the
standard
in
57(e)
if
there's
evidence
of
a
serious
hazard,
we
think
state
law
can
impose
on
a
generic
manufacturer
which
is
putting
a
potentially
dangerous
product
on
the
market
the
obligation
to
--
to
investigate.
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
talk
about
buckman
for
just
a
minute,
please,
because
it's
--
it's
come
up.
buckman
is
fundamentally
different.
there
was
no
independent
state
law
duty
to
warn
at
issue
in
buckman.
it
was
solely
a
tort
based
on
lying
to
the
fda.
it
is
a
tort
that
depended
entirely
on
the
existence
of
the
fda.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
buckman
was
a
situation
of
a
collateral
attack
on
a
decision
that
had
actually
been
made
by
fda.
there
was
no
independent
duty
--
state
law
or
duty
to
warn,
no
relationship
between
the
person
submitting
information
to
fda.
it
was
just
a
state
making
the
tort
to
lie
to
the
fda,
and
you
would
have
had
the
state
regulating
nothing
but
the
relationship
between
the
manufacturer
and
fda.
here
state
law
is
regulating
the
relationship
between
the
manufacturer
and
--
and
the
patient
through
the
doctor,
and
that's
a
traditional
area
of
state
regulation,
duty
to
warn,
and,
justice
kagan,
i
think
you're
right,
the
question
then
is
whether
there
is
an
affirmative
defense
of
--
of
preemption,
and
the
preemption
comes
in.
it's
very
different
from
buckman
in
that
situation.
it's
up
to
the
defendant
to
prove,
it's
not
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action
as
in
buckman.
it's
part
of
the
defense
for
the
defendant
to
prove
that
--
that
it
is
--
that
the
cause
of
action
is
preempted.
and
in
our
view
it's
not
preempted
if
the
standard
in
57(e)
is
met
to
propose
a
labeling
change
that
is
an
obligation
that
extends
to
all
manufacturers
generic
or
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
can't
revise
the
labeling,
but
that
doesn't
mean
it
can
do
nothing.
impossibility
preemption
kicks
in
only
when
it's
genuinely
impossible,
and
if
the
manufacturer
could
go
to
fda
and
propose
a
labeling
change,
it
is
not
impossible
for
to
it
do
that.
at
that
point
it's
up
to
fda
and
preemption
would
kick
in.
