justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
lefkowitz,
why
should--
justice
elena
kagan
--do
you
contest,
mr.
lefkowitz,
your
ability
to
make
that
request?
i
know
that
you
contest
your
obligation
to
make
that
request,
but
do
you
think
you
could
go
to
the
fda
and
make
that
request
and
set
a
process
in
motion?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
if
you
could
go
to
the
fda,
why
shouldn't
we
look
at
this
suit
in
this
way:
that
the
plaintiffs
are
bringing
a
standard
failure
to
warn
claim;
that
you
then
have
a
preemption
defense,
that
you'll
say
it's
impossible;
and
then
in
order
to
litigate
that
preemption
defense,
the
question
will
be,
well,
if
you
had
gone
to
the
fda,
what
would
the
fda
have
done?
would
it
in
fact
have
required
both
brand
names
and
generics
to
change
the
label?
and
if
it
would
have,
you
would
not
have
had
--
been
put
in
an
impossible
position.
justice
elena
kagan
but
mr.
lefkowitz,
i
think
what
the
respondents
would
say
is
that
you
are
mischaracterizing
their
complaint
and
making
it
into
something
that
it's
not.
their
complaint
is
a
standard
state
failure
to
warn
claim.
now,
you
have
a
preemption
defense
to
that
claim,
and
in
that
preemption
defense
there's
going
to
be
questions
about
your
disclosure
obligations
and
whether
the
fda
would
have
responded
in
a
certain
way
to
your
disclosure
obligations,
but
it's
in
a
fundamentally
different
posture
than
the
one
that
you're
suggesting.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
agree
that
you
don't
have
any
ability
yourself
to
change
the
warning,
but
here's
what
the
fda
has
said.
the
fda
has
said
if
an
anda
applicant
--
and
that's
you;
you're
an
anda
applicant
--
believes
new
safety
information
should
be
added
to
a
product's
labeling,
presumably
because
they've
gotten
information
that
suggests
that
the
product's
labeling
is
wrong,
then
it
should
contact
the
fda,
and
the
fda
will
determine
whether
the
labeling
for
the
generic
and
listed
drugs
should
be
revised.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
kneedler,
suppose
that
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
you
that
there
is
an
obligation
of
the
kind
that
you
say
for
a
generic
drug
manufacturer
to
come
forward
and
request
a
label,
but
i
do
think
that
there's
an
opportunity
for
that
manufacturer
to
come
forward
and
ask
the
fda
to
revise
a
label.
if
that's
the
way
i
read
the
law,
does
your
result
follow?
do
you
think,
then,
that
state
law
claims
should
be
able
to
go
forward?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
lefkowitz,
if
you
had
asked,
you
would
be
in
a
different
situation.
if
you
had
asked
and
the
fda
had
sat
on
it
or
was
negotiating,
then
you
could
say,
look,
we've
done
all
we
can
right
now.
but
you're
not
in
that
situation.
you,
in
fact,
have
not
done
all
you
can
right
now
to
change
the
label
because
you
never
wrote
that
letter.
