justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
has
come
to
us
on
a
--
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
--
courts
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit.
respondents
were
prescribed
the
drug
reglan
to
treat
digestive
tract
problems.
each
received
generic
reglan
from
her
pharmacist.
after
taking
the
drug
for
several
years,
each
developed
a
serious
neurological
disorder.
respondents
then
sued
the
manufacturers
of
the
generic
drugs
in
a
state
court
alleging
that
the
manufacturers
failed
to
provide
an
adequate
warning
label.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
federal
drug
statutes
and
regulations
conflict
with
and
thus
pre-empt
these
state
tort
lawsuits.
the
fifth
and
eighth
circuits
found
no
pre-emption
and
allowed
the
lawsuits
to
proceed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgments
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
generic
manufacturers
have
demonstrated
a
conflict
between
state
and
federal
law.
state
law
requires
the
manufacturers
to
change
their
warning
labels
but
the
federal
drug
regulations
prevent
them
from
independently
doing
so.
the
manufacturers
could
potentially
have
complied
with
state
law
but
only
with
the
help
of
the
brand
name
reglan
manufacturer
and
the
special
permission
and
assistance
of
the
food
and
drug
administration,
a
federal
agency.
we
find
that
federal
law
pre-empts
the
state
law,
state
tort
lawsuits
here.
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
instructs
the
federal
law
--
that
federal
law
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land,
in
a
state
law
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding.
it
would
distort
the
plain
text
of
the
supremacy
clause
to
find
no
pre-emption
simply
because
a
federal
agency
has
the
discretion
to
resolve
an
existing
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
justice
kennedy
joins
all
but
part
iii–b–2
of
the
opinion.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
breyer
and
kagan
joined.
