justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
there
is
a
legal
obligation
to
advise
the
fda
when
you
have
reports
of
adverse
results
that
suggest
the
label
may
be
wrong.
are
you
disavowing
your
--
your
obligation
to
tell
the
fda
when
something's
wrong?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
please
describe
what
the
difference
between
that
obligation
and
the
obligation
to
suggest
a
label
change
when
you
know
it's
been
misbranded.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
--
so
what's
the
conflict
with
state
law,
meaning
you
have
an
obligation
to
keep
your
label
as
it
is,
but
if
you
also
have
a
federal
obligation
to
advise
the
fda
of
adverse
--
of
adverse
results
and
of
needs
for
change,
why
can't
you
then
comply
with
a
duty
to
warn
obligation
because
you
can
go
to
the
--
to
the
fda?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
do
you
think--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
do
you
think
congress
really
intended
to
create
a
market
in
which
consumers
can
only
sue
brand-named
products?
because
if
that's
the
case,
why
would
anybody
ever
take
a
genetic?
and
why
in
the
world
would
congress
create
a
different,
or
even
the
fda,
a
different
obligation
on
brand-named
products
or
generic
products
to
give
them
information
about
labels
when
they
know
there's
been
a
misbranding?
what
the
government
says
is
you
start
by
instructing
a
jury
that
there
had
to
actually
have
been
information
that
proved
a
misbranding.
that's
the
first
step
of
the
tort
suit
according
to
the
government.
so
why
should
you
or
why
would
congress
or
the
fda
have
intended
to
treat
the
two
differently?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
all
you're
arguing
is
that
this
rule
will
have
little
practical
effect,
that
there
is
going
to
be
very
few
lawsuits
that
could
be
brought
against
your
companies
because
you're
just
not
going
to
have
enough
information
to
suggest
a
label
change.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you,
and
i
think
that
this
is
part
of
what
your
adversary
has
been
talking
about
when
he
says
we
don't
usually
receive
adverse
incident
reports;
they
go
to
the
brand
manufacturer.
so
tell
me
what
you
view
as
your
main
obligation.
this
is
a
little
bit
like
what
justice
scalia
was
asking.
you
come
in
and
you
say
there's
a
drug,
it
has
an
adverse
effect,
there
should
have
been
a
warning
about
it
because
look
at
all
of
this
literature,
look
at
all
of
this
proof--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
this
drug
is,
in
fact,
in
some
way
plausibly
or
otherwise
causing
this
incident,
and
the
label
was
inadequate
to
tell
me
not
to
do
it.
is
that
your
obligation
completely?
you
don't
have
an
obligation
to
show
that
this
particular
manufacturer
knew
that
in
some
way?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
am
i
--
am
i
to
understand
--
and
i
think
i
am
understanding
you.
there
is
a
legal
obligation
in
the
statute
to
report
adverse
events.
you're
saying
that
the
statute
also
requires
every
manufacturer,
of
whatever
type,
to
monitor
the
safety
of
the
drug
they're
selling?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
if
reasonable
evidence,
whether
directly
in
their
possession
or
in
the
marketplace--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
the
difference,
as
i
see
it,
is
that
they're
not
suing
you
for
a
failure
to
tell
the
fda.
they're
suing
you
for
a
failure
to
tell
them.
it's
you
who
are
interposing
a
defense
and
saying
i
manufacture
a
dangerous
drug,
and
i
have
no
obligation
to
monitor
and
ensure
that
the
label
is
accurate.
and
what
the
government
is
saying,
as
i
understand
it
is,
no,
you
do.
yes,
we
understand
you
want
to
sell
more
cheaply,
but
not
at
the
cost
of
public
health.
so
what's
wrong
with
that
argument?
