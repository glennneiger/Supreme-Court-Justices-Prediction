but
you
have
another
--
you
have
another
route,
and
that's
what
the
government
is
telling
us:
that
you
could
propose
a
revision
of
the
label,
and
if
you
did
that,
then
you
would
be
home
free.
you
would
not
be
subject
to
the
state
suit.

no,
it
was
in
the
--
at
the
cert
stage
as
well.

the
federal
agency
says
that
these
suits
complement,
they're
not
at
odds
with,
the
federal
regime,
because
they
give
the
manufacturers
an
incentive
to
come
forward.
everyone
is
interested
in
making
sure
that
only
safe
drugs
are
marketed.
so,
far
from
detracting
from
the
federal
regime,
the
agency
responsible
says,
this
helps
us;
it
encourages
manufacturers
to
report.

mr.
lefkowitz,
there's
a
certain
overlap,
is
there
not?
some
of
the
generics
are
made
by
the
same
people
that
make
the
brand-name
drugs,
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
at
least
for
those
people,
they
have
the
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government
is
taking
the
position
that
there's
no
clash
between
the
government,
the
state,
and
federal
law.
it's
not
saying
that
you
commit
some
kind
of
federal
offense
if
you
don't
file
this
law.
the
government
is
saying,
the
question
is
preemption.
is
there
a
clash
between
federal
and
state
law
to
traditional
federal
warn
you
have
a
preemption
defense
if
you
tell
the
fda,
and
if
either
the
fda
does
nothing
or
tells
you,
no,
we're
not
going
to
change
the
label?

the
--
the
--
buckman
was
about,
was
a
--
it
was
a
very
odd
case
to
be
brought
under
state
law
for
fraud
on
a
federal
agency.
