justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-993,
pliva,
incorporated
v.
mensing,
and
the
consolidated
cases.
mr.
lefkowitz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense,
but
we
do
have
our
wyeth
decision
that
seems
to
cut
the
other
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
buckman
--
buckman
was
arguably
a
little
bit
different,
in
that
there's
a
concern
expressed
in
that
case
that
requiring
allowing
the
state
suit
to
go
forward
would
cause
manufacturers
to
basically
inundate
the
agency
with
proposals
and
warning
revisions,
so
that
there
would
be
so
many
things
that
the
agency
wouldn't
even
be
able
to
process
them,
and
they
would
become
meaningless
to
the
consumers.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
concern
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
disclose
--
i'm
sorry.
to
disclose
to
the
fda?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
lefkowitz.
mr.
bograd.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
happens--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--how
long
does
it
take
--
how
long
typically
does
it
take
the
fda
to
respond
to
a
request
from
a
generic
manufacturer
that
it
--
it
ask
the
branded
manufacturer
to
change
the
label?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
those
the
ones
that
are
submitted
by
generic
manufacturers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--whether
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
was
just
going
to
ask,
does
the
fda
give
you
an
up
or
a
down,
or
does
it
just
not
take
action
sometimes
if
you
submit
one
of
these
requests?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
can
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
your
theory
of
the
case
is
accepted,
this
is
what
will
happen:
every
time
a
generic
manufacturer
gets
an
adverse
incident
report,
it
will
send
that
on
to
the
fda,
and
there
will
be
a
boilerplate
sentence
at
the
end
of
it
saying,
we
think
you
should
consider
revising
the
labels
because
of
this,
and
then,
under
your
theory,
that
manufacturer
is
completely
protected
from
state
suits?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they're
not
going
to
take
a
chance.
they're
going
to
say,
if
you're
the
fda,
you
look
at
it.
we're
just
telling
you
what
we
know,
and
we
think
you
ought
to
consider
revising
the
label.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
we
think
you
should
revise
the
label;
if
you
agree,
this
is
what
it
should
look
like.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
lead
to
preemption?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
lead
to
preemption?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
wouldn't
you
--
if
you
were
the
generic
company's
lawyer,
you
would
advise
them
to
do
that
in
every
case,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know
that's
what
this
case
is,
but
if
--
a
reasonable
generic
manufacturer
would
be
worried
about
every
case,
and
it
would
just
add
this
boilerplate
language
at
the
end
of
every
letter,
and
as
i
understand
your
theory,
they
would
be
protected.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
in
the
brief
--
and
in
the
brief
that
you
filed
you
said
one
of
the
concerns
is
that
people
are
going
to
flood
the
fda
with
all
these
warnings
and
--
and
whatever,
and
that
would
interfere
with
the
fda's
ability.
now
you're
telling
me
--
you
--
you
said
when
you
started
out
that
you
think
it's
unlikely
or
you
don't
think
it's
likely.
in
your
brief
it
said
sg
language
you
said
we're
not
prepared
to
predict
that
a
ruling
would
do
this.
so,
why
is
that
a
difference
between
those
two
cases?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
not
--
the
regulation
doesn't
say
propose
a
labeling
change.
it
says
labeling
shall
be
revised,
and
the
one
thing
we
know
is
that
the
generic
manufacturer
can't
revise
the
labeling
from
the
branded
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
lefkowitz,
you
have
your
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
lefkowitz.
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
