mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
ordinary
operation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
as
the
government
agrees,
hatch-waxman's
plain
text
requires
generic
drugs
to
have
the
same
warnings
as
their
brand-name
equivalents,
so
state
law
can't
require
generic
drugs
to
use
different
warnings.
after
all,
generics
can't
simultaneously
comply
with
a
federal
duty
to
be
the
same
and
a
state
duty
to
be
different.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
well,
your
honor,
the
wyeth
decision
is
premised
on
the
fundamental
conclusion
that
federal
law
obligates
and
accommodates
the
brand
manufacturer
to
utilize
a
specific
regulation,
the
cbe
regulation,
in
order
to
make
a
warning
change,
in
order
to
comply
with
its
obligations
under
201.57.
and,
as
the
government
agrees,
we
don't
have
the
opportunity
or
the
authority
to
use
a
cbe
regulation
change.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
justice
ginsburg,
the
government
agrees
with
us
that
we
can't
actually
change
the
label.
what
they
say
is,
we
could
have
an
obligation,
or
they
actually,
in
--
for
the
very
first
time
ever
in
their
brief
in
this
court
at
the
merit
stage,
said
that
there
is
a--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--well,
your
honor,
i
didn't
read
the
cert
stage
as
saying
we
had
quite
the
same
duty
to
ask
the
fda,
although
clearly
they
now
believe
that
we
have
a
duty
to
ask
the
fda.
and
of
course
that's
not
a
duty
that
appears
in
any
of
their
notice
and
comment
rulemaking.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
yes,
justice
kennedy,
this
is
the
take-steps.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
thank
you,
justice
kennedy.
we
maintain
that
a
claim
that
under
state
law
a
generic
company
can
be
liable
for
not
asking
the
fda
to
make
a
labeling
change
is
preempted
under
this
court's
decisions
both
in
buckman
and
in
arkla,
because
what
the
--
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
the
disclosure
obligations
between
a
federal
agency
and
a
federally
regulated
party
are
inherently
federal
in
character,
and
this
is
not
a
subject
of
traditional
state
tort
law.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
no,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
that
was
in
part
what
was
--
what
came
up
in
the
briefing
in
the
wyeth
case.
wyeth
initially
said
it
didn't
have
the
obligation
and
couldn't
use
the
cbe,
and
then
ms.
levine
said:
well,
in
that
case
you
could
have
asked
the
fda
to
make
a
change,
and
the
court
didn't
need
to
even
address
that
issue,
because
the
court
found
that
there
actually
was
a
regulation
on
point
that
gave
the
brand
manufacturer
the
ability
to
change.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
history,
the
27-year
history
of
hatch-waxman,
where
the
federal
government
has
ever
said
that
there
is
a
legal
obligation
to
lobby
the
fda
for
a
labeling
change.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
absolutely
not,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
under
the
fda
regulation
314.80
and
314.98,
we
have
a
myriad
of
disclosure
obligations.
any
time
a
generic
learns
about
an
adverse
report,
it
has
to
report
it
to
the
fda,
it
has
to
investigate
it,
and
if
it
doesn't
do
that
then
it's
not
in
compliance
with
its
federal
obligations
and
the
fda
has
plenary
authority
to
take
all
sorts
of
action.
but
just
as
the
court
said
in
the
buckman
decision,
without
dissent,
when
a
company
doesn't
make
appropriate
disclosures
to
the
fda,
even
if
people
are
hurt
by
that,
even
if
it's
--
if
it
causes
people
to
be
injured
and
states
might
otherwise
want
to
compensate
them
for
them,
those
disclosure
obligations
are
up
to
the
fda
with
its
discretion
to
enforce.
and
the
court
looked
directly
to
congress
in
section
337.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
well,
first
of
all,
there's
a
little
bit
of
a
difference
between
reporting
all
of
the
adverse
events,
which
we
clearly
do,
and
asking
the
fda
to
make
a
determination
that
the
fda
has
said
is
only
for
the
fda
to
make
with
respect
to
generic
companies.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
your
honor,
there's
no
question
that
we
could
certainly
ask
the
fda,
and
in
fact
if
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
a
label
was
not
accurate,
not
strong
enough,
we
would
certainly
do
that.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there's
either
a
federal
obligation
or
a
state
duty
to
do
this,
and--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--your
honor,
that
is
the
precise
set
of
issues
that
this
court
addressed
both
in
buckman
and
in
arkla,
in
a
situation
where
all
we
could
have
done,
and
we
weren't
obligated
to
do,
was
ask
the
fda.
for
a
state
to
hold
us
liable
for
not
asking
the
fda
is
asking
a
state
jury
to
put
itself
into
the
shoes
of
the
fda,
to
speculate
how
the
fda
would
have
decided
hypothetical
issues,
which
arkla
says
is
foreclosed
in
an
area
where
the
federal
government,
the
federal
agency,
has
exclusive
authority.
and
in
buckman,
the
court
said
that
would
disrupt
and
usurp
the
discretion
of
the
agency
to
decide
whether
to
punish
and
how
to
punish
disclosure.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
well,
your
honor,
the
government
had
articulated
that
proposition
in
the
buckman
case
and
again
several
years
later
in
the
warner-lambert
case.
obviously,
they're
taking
a
different
position
here.
but
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
what
lay
at
the
core
of
the
buckman
decision
was
that
the
relationship,
the
disclosures,
between
the
federal
agency
and
its
regulated
party,
are
inherently
federal
and
states
simply
don't
have
a
business
trying
to
enforce
those
obligations,
because
that
does
take
away
from
the
authority
and
the
discretion.
and
the
court
looked
to
section
337
as
evidence
that
congress
intended
that
violations
of
the
fdca
be
enforced
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
well,
we
know
from
the
current
fda
database
that
there
were
over
1600
requests
for
labeling
revisions
that
the
fda
has
not
acted
on,
and
that's
just
in
the
aftermath
of
wyeth.
and
there
are
far
more
generic
manufacturers
who
would
be
burdened
by
this
new
obligation.
but,
your
honor,
i
would--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--your
honor,
almost
all
of
them
i
would
believe
are
from
branded
manufacturers,
because
generic
manufacturers
until
the
briefing
in
this
court
have
never
believed
that
they
have
any
obligation
to
ask
the
fda.
in
fact,
interestingly,
the
fda
has
addressed
what
happens
in
the
marketplace
when
a
brand
exits
the
market
and
the
only
drugs
left
are
the
10
or
15
generics.
and
what
the
fda
has
said,
and
they
have
published
52
federal
register
notices
--
we
cite
one
of
them
in
our
reply
brief
--
they
have
said:
in
such
a
situation,
we
will
designate
one
of
the
generics
to
be
the
leader
for
purposes
of
establishing
the
label,
and
everyone
else
has
to
follow.
but
critically,
what
the
fda
has
said
is:
in
those
situations,
we,
the
fda,
will
tell
you
when
the
label
needs
to
change.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
your
honor,
we
have
an
obligation,
actually,
to
provide
all
of
that
information
to
the
fda.
generics,
unlike
brand
companies,
aren't
equipped
in
the
same
way,
necessarily,
to
evaluate
the--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--well,
no.
we--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--the
plaintiffs
allege
that
we
violated
federal
disclosure
obligations.
of
course,
there's
no
basis
for
a
state
claim
for
that.
in
fact,
to
--
to
address
justice
ginsburg's
question--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--i
think
that
law,
your
honor,
would
conflict
with
the
buckman
principles
and
the
arkla
principles.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
if
the
--
i
understood
justice
breyer's
question
to
be
asking
whether
--
not
only
did
we
have
to
tell
the
fda,
which
we
clearly
do,
but
whether
we
then
had
some
additional
duty
to
ask
the
fda
to
change
the
warning.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
well,
i
think
that's
what
they're
suggesting.
but
even
if
it
were
just
the
former--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--even
if
it's
just
the
former,
your
honor,
even
if
it's
just
the
failure
to
disclose
adverse
reports--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--which
we
know
we
have
an
obligation
to
do,
there
is
no
history
of
state
regulation
of
communications
between
federal
--
federal
agencies
and
the
regulated
parties.
those
are
not
the
kinds
of
parallel
claims
cases,
like
in
lohr
v.
medtronic--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--justice
breyer,
correct,
because
that's
exactly
--
remember,
in
buckman
what
happened
was
an
individual
was
injured
because
the
company
had
not
accurately
disclosed,
in
fact
had
misled
the
agency
about
the
purpose
of
marketing
these
bone
screws.
clearly
there
was
a
state
interest
in
protecting
and
providing
a
remedy
to
that
consumer,
a
state
interest
in
ensuring
accurate
disclosures
to
the
government,
and
in
fact
an
allegation
that
had
there
been
accurate
disclosures
to
the
government,
the
fda
would
have
made
a
different
safety
and
labeling
determination.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
not
in
a
state
court,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
correct.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
a
claim,
your
honor,
of
disclosure
to
the
fda
relates
to
the
inherently
federal
relationship.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
no,
i
said
the
state
suit
--
i
apologize.
i
meant
to
say
and
i
thought
i
said
the
state
suit
would
not
lie
because
buckman
preempts
that
type
of
lawsuit.
buckman
says
even
in
that
terrible
situation,
misleading
to
the
fda,
failure
to
disclose
what
the
fda
requires
you
to
disclose,
there
is
no
state
cause
of
action
because
this
is
a
uniquely
federal
area
and
states
can't
supplant
the
fda
in
its
enforcement
discretion.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
justice
kagan,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
what
they
pled
below
was
a
traditional
failure
to
warn.
a
failure
to
warn
claim
means
you
did
not
warn
the
public
in
the
way
that
we
think
under
state
law
you
should
have.
and
whereas
in
wyeth
the
congress
through
the
fda
has
said
a
brand
manufacturer
ultimately
is
responsible
for
the
warnings
it
issues
and
therefore
can
change
the
warning
and
therefore
can
be
held
liable,
we
don't
have
--
and
the
government
agrees
with
us
--
we
don't
have
any
mechanism
under
law
to
change
the
warnings.
so
to
the
extent
this
is
a
traditional
failure
to
warn
claim,
it
has
to
be
preempted
under
simple
supremacy
clause
principles.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
your
honor,
that
is
exactly
what
the
fda
says.
they
point
for
that
to
a
preamble
in
1992
to
a
rulemaking
that
didn't
address
the
relevant
201.57
regulation,
a
preamble
that
was
issued
without
notice
and
comment
rulemaking,
and
a
preamble
that
doesn't
actually
impose
a
duty.
it
says
if,
subjunctively,
we
believe
that
there
should
be
a
label
change,
we
should
do
something,
we
should
ask
the
fda.
not
we
must,
not
we
shall.
and
even
then
it
said:
and
the
fda
will
then
make
a
decision,
which
makes
clear
that
this
is
not
a
decision
for
state
juries
to
make.
your
honor,
the
fda
has
articulated
a
federal
duty
today
in
its
briefing
in
this
case
that
is
very
much
at
odds
with
what
it
has
specifically
said
about
what
a
generic's
obligation
is
under
201.57.
in
the
two
notice
and
comment
rulemakings
at
issue
during
the
relevant
time
period
here,
in
2000
and
2006,
what
the
fda
said
very
specifically
was
a
generic's
obligation
under
201.57
is
to
use
the
brand
label,
even
if
the
brand
label
isn't
the
most
up-to-date.
and
the
reason
is
the
policy
underlying
hatch-waxman
is
that
brand
companies
do
safety
and
efficacy
testing;
generics
do
sameness
testing.
generics
are
required
to
make
copies
of
the
drugs
and
by
definition
make
copies
of
the
labels,
because
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
to
go
into
a
drugstore
to
buy
advil
and
to
see
15
different
generic
ibuprofen
and
to
have
15
different
sets
of
warnings.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
it
was
a
medical
device
manufacturer.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
your
honor,
i
do
think
it's
a
fortiori.
buckman
involves
the
branded
process
of
coming
on
with
an
equivalent
medical
device
under
the
510k
process.
this
is
actually
a
situation
where,
after
intensive
back
and
forth
with
the
fda,
the
brand
company
crafts
the
label
that
the
fda
approves
and
the
generic
is
given
one
responsibility
by
congress.
the
responsibility
is
to
maintain
the
same
label
as
the
brand.
that's
the
critical
difference.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
justice
sotomayor,
i
want
to
take
both
halves
of
your
question.
in
27
years
of
enforcement
under
hatch-waxman,
the
fda
has
never
once
said
that
a
generic
drug
that
uses
the
brand
label,
as
required
under
505(j)
of
the
statute
is
misbranded.
and
the
--
look,
i
understand
that
from
the
consumer's
perspective
it
may
not
make
a
lot
of
sense.
but
what
congress
specifically
said
is
that
a
generic
has
to
bear
the
same
label,
and
it's
because
they
do
have
different
purposes,
different
functions.
congress
said
that
whenever
there
is
a
brand
drug
on
the
market
that
no
longer
is
protected
by
its
patent
monopoly
but
has
been
selling
for
$10
or
$20
a
pill,
we
want
to
have
generics
selling
for
pennies
for
the
pill,
and
they've
given
branded
and
generics
different
obligations.
and
the
different
obligations
are
seen
most
clearly
through
the
prism
of
the
wyeth
case.
the
wyeth
case
was
--
it
was
critical
in
the
wyeth
case
that
this
court
found
that
the
brand
company
had
the
ability,
had
the
obligation,
to
use
the
cbe
regulations
to
actually
change
the
label,
whereas
here
what
the
fda
has
said
time
and
time
again
is:
we'll
tell
a
generic
when
the
generic
has
to
change
the
label,
because
we
don't
assume
that
the
generics
are
going
to
know
when
the
label
should
change
because
they
don't
have
the
same
basis
of
clinical
testing
and
results.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
--
the
fda
or
this
court
would
hold
differently
in
a
case
where
the
generic
at
issue
was
an
authorized
generic,
a
generic
manufactured
by
a
brand
company
that
had,
in
fact,
done
all
the
clinical
safety
testing
and
might
have
a
different
basis
for
assessing
the
occasional
adverse
reports
that
they
get.
but,
again,
the
keys
to
understanding
the
--
the
generic
industry
--
generics
rarely
even
get
adverse
reports
because
if
a
doctor
prescribes
a
drug,
the
doctor
prescribes
it
as
the
brand,
and
then
checks
off
the
box
that
says
a
generic
can
be
issued.
if
a
patient
comes
and
tells
him
about
an
adverse
report,
the
doctor
has
no
idea
which
generic
of
the
15
that
might
be
in
the
market
actually
was
dispensed,
so
he'll
actually
tell
the
brand
company.
he'll
report
the
adverse
event
to
the
brand
company.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
your
honor,
what
i'm
arguing
is
that
for
the
fda
to
impose
a
new
federal
obligation
that
will
significantly
change
the
way
generic
companies
conduct
their
business
should
go
through
notice
and
comment
rulemaking.
it
should
not
rely
on
a
preamble
to
a
different
rulemaking
that
didn't
go
through
notice
and
comment.
it
should
not
rely
on
briefs
that
are
filed
at
the
merits
stage,
because
this
would
totally
change
the
way
generics
do
business.
generics
don't
have
a
practice
--
they're
not
even
set
up
--
to
go
and
figure
out
what
label
changes
would
be
appropriate.
they
are
set
up
to
report
adverse
events
to
the
fda,
and
what
congress
has
said
and
what
the
fda
has
said
is
violations
of
those
statutes,
violations
of
those
regulations,
are
exclusively
within
the
province
of
the
federal
government.
that's
what
buckman
says
very
clearly
when
it
looks
at
section
337.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
thank
you.
mr.
kneedler
has
basically
postulated
a
situation
where
we're
going
to
have
jury
trials
about
whether
a
federal
duty
to
the
fda
was
breached.
and
it's
interesting,
he
says
that
this
isn't
buckman,
but
of
course,
buckman
involved
the
same
duty
not
to
sell
a
dangerous
product,
and
the
same
issue
of
lack
of
disclosure
to
the
fda.
now,
he
says
it
was
a
collateral
attack,
but
actually
that
was
the
premise
of
justice
stevens'
concurrence,
where
justice
stevens
said
i
get
to
the
same
result
for
a
different
reason.
what
the
court
said
was
nothing
about
a
collateral
attack.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
justice
sotomayor,
respectfully,
what's
wrong
with
the
premises,
if
they're
claiming
failure
to
warn,
it's
a
very
simple
case
of
impossibility
preemption.
we
couldn't
warn,
and
the
government's
brief
makes
clear
we
had
no
ability
to
warn.
what
the
government
is
now
doing
is
it's
taking
a
regulation,
201.57,
which
doesn't
say
the
word
"ask"
in
it.
it
actually
says
"revise".
and
it
says
revise
because
it's
a
regulation
written
for
brand
manufacturers
that
have
the
cbe
option
available
to
them,
and
they
are
then
trying
to
incorporate
the
words
"duty
to
ask"
through
this
brief
without,
as
justice
alito
says,
taking
into
any
account
through
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
the
effect
of
this.
well,
we
know
that
there
are
over
1,600
requests
for
labeling
revisions
pending
at
the
fda
now,
650
of
them
are
pending
for
more
than
6
months.
and
at
the
relevant
time
of
this
case,
your
honor,
not
only
would
we
have
had
to
ask
the
fda,
but
then
the
fda
would
have
had
to
negotiate
with
the
brand,
because
prior
to
the
fdaaa
amendments,
the
fda
couldn't
order
a
brand
to
change,
so
we
would
have
had
to
make
the
request,
the
fda
would
have
had
to
negotiate
the
brand
change,
and
then
we
would
have
had
to
follow.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
your
honor,
and
again
just
to
pick
up
on
--
on
what
chief
justice
roberts
said
and
justice
scalia
said,
we
have
done
everything
we
are
required
to
do,
which
is
to
provide
all
of
the
information
about
adverse
reports
that
we
have
and
all
of
the
results
of
our
investigations
to
the
government.
and
if
the
government
wants
to
impose
a
new
duty
through
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
saying,
and
now
we
have
a
duty
to
ask
for
a
label
change,
in
addition--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--your
honor,
buckman
makes
very
clear
that
a
state
trying
to
regulate
disclosure
obligations
to
the
federal
government
is
simply
off
limits,
and
in
fact--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--your
honor,
it
was
a
case
brought
by
a
plaintiff
who
was
injured
claiming
that
the
company
had
not
made
proper,
adequate
disclosures
to
the
fda.
it's
the
same
thing
here,
and
i
just
want
to
point--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--absolutely.
what
they
are
saying--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--well,
in
a
sense
the
government
is
really
saying
we
--
to
lobby
or
to
propose
changes
is
a
--
is
a
very
fine
distinction.
clearly,
what
the
government
is
now
saying
is
they
are
reading
a
regulation
that
they've
always
interpreted
as
being
only
applicable
to
brand
companies
and
saying
now
it's
applicable
to
their
companies
and
it
incorporates
new
language
that
says
not
just
revise
but
ask.
