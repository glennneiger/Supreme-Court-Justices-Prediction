alito,

suppose
a
generic
--
suppose
that
the
fda
issued
a
rule
that
says
a
generic
drug
manufacturer
has
no
obligation
to
request
a
change
in
labeling.
could
a
generic
drug
manufacturer
be
held
liable
on
a
failure
to
warn
claim
on
the
theory
that
it
could
have
lobbied
the
fda
to
change
the
rule
that
says
that
the
generic
drug
manufacturer
has
no
obligation
to
ask
for
a
change
in
labeling?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
why
--
isn't
that
where
your
theory
leads?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
your
theory
is
that
they
have
a
duty
to
pursue
an
informal
process
that
is
nowhere
provided
for
under
the
fda
rules;
and
so
i
don't
--
so
it's
a
duty
to
lobby
the
fda
basically
to
change
the
rules,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
assuming
that
they're
correct
in
their
interpretation
of
their
own
regulations.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
has
the
fda
made
any
calculation
of
the
economic
consequences
of
imposing
this
duty
on
generic
drug
manufacturers?
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
a
good
idea
or
not,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
may
significantly
increase
the
costs
for
generic
drug
manufacturers,
and
therefore
counteract
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
statute,
which
was
to
provide
generic
drugs
at
a
low
cost.
