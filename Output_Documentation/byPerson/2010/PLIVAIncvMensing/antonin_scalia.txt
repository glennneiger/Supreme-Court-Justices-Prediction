justice
antonin
scalia
would
the
--
excuse
me,
justice.
would
the
federally
licensed
drug
manufacturer
have
a
similar
obligation
to
lobby
the
fda
for
a
change?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
assume
there
hadn't
been.
assume
there
hadn't
been
such
a
regulation.
do
you
understand
it
to
be
the
government's
position
that
the
licensed
drug
manufacturer
is
not
protected
from
state
suits,
even
though
it
has
a
federal
permission
to
give
certain
warnings,
unless
it
has
lobbied
the
fda
to
change
those
warnings?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
you
had
to
tell
the
fda
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
that
if
the
claim
here
is
simply
that
you
did
not
disclose
properly,
that
claim
could
be
brought?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
disclose
to
the
fda.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
just
described
buckman
as
--
as
involving
precisely
that,
failure
to
tell
the
fda
the
purpose
of
the
screws.
you
said
that
the
state
--
the
state
suit
would
lie
because
of
that
failure.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they're
--
they're
--
they're
under
the
obligation
to
report
to
the
fda
the
facts
which
establish
the
grave
risk,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
argument
here
is
whether
it
--
it
will
be
the
fda
ultimately
that
determines
whether
there
was
a
grave
enough
risk
to
modify
the
--
the
label
or
whether
that
call
will
be
made
by
--
by
a
state
court
guessing
what
the
fda
would
have
done,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
--
but
--
no,
but
--
but
surely
you
have
to
establish
not
only
that
the
generic
manufacturer
requested
a
label
change,
but
that
a
label
change
would
have
been
approved.
otherwise
there's
no
causation.
surely--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
part
of
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
--
but
their
--
their
preemption
claim
is
we
had
to
give
these
warnings,
and
you
don't
contest
that.
they
had
to
give
the
warnings
that
they
gave,
unless
the
fda
said
that
the
warnings
must
be
changed,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
hold
them
liable,
so
long
as
they
continued
to
give
the
warnings
that
they
had
to
give.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
could
have
lobbied
the
fda
to
say,
you
know,
change
the
warning,
but
if
the
fda
said
--
suppose
the
--
suppose
they
did
tell
the
fda,
please
modify
the
label,
and
the
fda
said
no.
would
your
lawsuit
still
proceed?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
right.
you're
drawing
a
line
between
the
fda
rejecting
a
warning
and
the
fda
not
accepting
the
warning;
is
that
the
line
you're
drawing?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
so
i
understand
what
you've
said,
this
3-month
turnaround
that
you
mentioned,
they
are
all
requests
from
labeled
manufacturers,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
that
generic
manufacturers
don't
make
any
requests.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
a
generic
manufacturer
have
to
be
an
expert
in
the
field
in
which
it
manufactures?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
--
what
does
being
an
expert
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
context,
being
an
expert
means
being
able
to
produce
exactly
the
drug
that
has
been
approved
by
the
fda,
right?
you
don't
have
to
be
expert
in
anything
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
else
do
they
need?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
make
them
an
expert.
i'm
talking
about
what
expertise
does
--
does
the
company
have
to
--
to
possess.
it
surely
has
to
possess
the
chemical
expertise
to
produce
exactly
the
product
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
has
been
approved
by
the
fda.
what
other
expertise
is
necessary?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that'd
take
any
expertise.
you
have
people
who
complain,
i've
taken
--
i've
taken
your
pill,
and
it
--
it,
you
know,
it's
caused
--
this
is
expertise?
that's
not
what
i
normally
think
of.
whereas
a
drug
manufacturer
does,
indeed,
require
expertise,
conducting
tests
and
knowing
what
changes
will
produce
what
results
and
so
forth;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
somebody
has
been
appointed
in
all
those
cases
to
sort
of
carry
the
flag,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
they
have
a
distinct
obligation
to
propose
labeling
changes
when
they
--
when
they
think
they're
necessary?
justice
antonin
scalia
make
it
a
long
sentence,
with
a
lot
of
"ands".
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
assume
that
the
patient's
physician
has
the
same
opportunity.
anybody
could
go
to
the
fda
and
say
this
label
ought
to
be
changed,
right?
so
the
--
the
physician
taking
care
of
this
plaintiff
didn't
--
had
the
opportunity
to
go
to
the
fda
and
didn't.
is
there
a
cause
of
action
against
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
what
the
--
the
fdca
regulation.
we're
talking
about
what
state
law
would
allow,
and
state
law
would
allow
a
suit
against
the
physician
because
he
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
go
to
the
fda
and
propose
a
label
change.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
the
--
the
prologue
--
the
prologue
to
the
rule
said
that,
and
the
rule
was
never
submitted
for
notice
and
comment.
is
that
what
you're
relying
on,
that
prologue?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
decide
whether
a
generic
manufacturer
ought
to
have
proposed
a
--
a
labeling
change?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
generic
manufacturer.
he
doesn't
know
anything
about
--
about
science.
he
knows
how
to
replicate
this
pill
exactly.
that's
all
--
that's
all
he
really
knows.
now,
what
is
the
test
you're
going
to
impose
to
--
to
a
jury
to
decide
whether
this
generic
manufacturer
ought
to
have
--
ought
to
have
proposed
a
labeling
change?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
--
is
it,
well,
you
know,
if
he
had
been
as
well
armed
scientifically
as
the
original
manufacturer
of
the
labeled
drug,
he
should
have
known
or,
you
know,
does
this
guy
who
graduated
from
high
school
and
can
replicate
a
pill,
should
he
have
known?
what
--
what's
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lefkowitz,
do
you
agree
with
justice
ginsburg's
characterization
of
the
government's
position?
i
thought
the
government
was
saying
that
there
was
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
generics
to
propose
changes.
justice
antonin
scalia
otherwise,
the
government
would
be
saying
you
have
an
obligation
to
lobby,
and
i
don't
think
they're
saying
that.
