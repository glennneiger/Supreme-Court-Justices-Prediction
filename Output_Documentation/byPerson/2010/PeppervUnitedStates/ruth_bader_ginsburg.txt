if
the
law
of
the
case
--
if
the
law
in
the
case
is
left
to
the
district
court,
then
the
district
court
can
say,
well,
the
law
of
the
case,
that's
what
that
other
judge
said,
but
it
was
a
question
of
what's
a
reasonable
time,
and
i'm
--
i
appraise
it
differently.
the
--
the
judgment
has
been
vacated,
the
sentence
has
been
vacated,
so
how
does
the
law
of
the
case
survive?
i
mean,
is
--
the
judgment
is
no
longer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
a
district
judge
say,
later
on
in
the
process:
i
made
a
ruling
earlier
in
the
case;
i
have
since
done
a
lot
of
research,
and
i
now
think
that
that
ruling
was
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
do
with
3742(g)(2)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
sentencing
--
is
the
sentencing
commission
--
it
still
has
that
guideline
that
you
can
--
you
can
depart
--
you
can
lower
within
the
guidelines,
but
not
beyond
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as
the
sentencing
commission
itself
is
concerned,
its
position
is
still
that
post-conviction
behavior
does
not
warrant
a
below-the-guideline
sentence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
true
then
that
in
all
of
the
briefings
in
booker,
3742(g)
was
not
mentioned
by
anybody?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
was
a
question
of
the
court
overlooking
it.
the
court
didn't
say
anything
one
way
or
the
other
about
it
because
it
wasn't
presented
as
one
of
the
statutes
that
would
have
to
be
overruled?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
doesn't
it
conflict
with
3553(a)(2),
that
is,
the
overriding
provision
that
a
sentence
should
be
sufficient
but
not
greater
than
necessary
to
deter
criminal
conduct.
and
the
judge
is
looking
at
this
defendant
and
says
--
a
criminal
--
to
deter
criminal
conduct
and
protect
public
against
future
crimes:
"well,
this
person
has
turned
out
to
be
a
model
citizen,
and
we
don't
have
to
keep
him
in
for
a
longer
time
to
protect
the
public
against
future
crimes.
"
"so
if
i
were
to
apply
3742(g)(2),
i
would
give
him
a
sentence
that
is
unnecessary
to
protect
the
public
against
future
crimes.
"
