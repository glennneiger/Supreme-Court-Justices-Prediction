mr.
alfredo
parrish
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
having
successfully
completed
drug
treatment
in
prison,
and
having
come
home
to
succeed
as
a
college
student,
valued
employee,
and
family
man,
jason
pepper
presents
to
this
court
two
questions:
whether
post-sentencing
rehabilitation
is
a
permissible
basis
for
a
downward
variance
from
the
sentencing
guidelines
at
resentencing,
and
whether
the
district
court
judge
in
pepper's
resentencing
was
bound
by
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine
in
its
5k
departure
ruling
absent
new
facts,
changes
in
the
controlling
law,
or
to
avoid
a
manifest
injustice.
post-sentencing
rehabilitation
has
traditionally
been
a
relevant
factor
for
judges
to
consider
and
is
now
a
permissible
ground
for
a
non-guideline
sentence.
3553(a)
and
3661
are
the
authorities
permitting
post-sentencing
rehabilitation
as
a
consideration
for
variance.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
they
are
like
apples
and
oranges.
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine
is
what
you
refer
to
as
a
matter
that
is
left
in
the
district
court.
the
other
issue
of
the
--
whether
or
not
the
individual
qualifies
for
downward
variance
is
a
completely
separate
issue.
the
law
of
the
case
remains
with
the
district
court
judge.
in
the
other
issue
that
we
have,
it's
whether
or
not
he's
entitled
to
a
downward
variance
based
upon
the
book
of
remedies.
so
they
are
not,
in
fact,
the
same
issues.
and
there
is
no
tension--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--the
law
of
the
case
survives
on
a
couple
of
basic
principles.
one,
there
has
to
be
new
facts
that
the
district
court
judge
heard;
there
has
to
be
a
change
of
controlling
law;
and
there
has
to
be
a
reason
to
avoid
a
manifest
justice.
if
you
go
back
to
the
5k,
one
departure
that
the
first
judge
made
the
decision
on,
that
law
--
that
was
law
of
the
case.
that
percentage
followed
mr.
pepper
straight
through
the
process.
that's
a
totally
separate
ruling
from
any
of
the
other
factors
in
this
case
that
relate
to
his
downward
variance.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
absolutely,
they
could
do
that.
the
circumstances
would
be,
did
they
see
new
facts?
was
there
a
change
of
controlling
law?
the
reason
we
do
this
is
because
we
want
to
have
confidence
in
that
decision
to
make
sure
litigants
don't
go
judge
shopping.
so
that's
part
of
the
reason
this
law
of
the
case
doctrine
is
in
there.
even
in
judge
posner's
second
circuit
decision
we
cite
in
our
brief,
you
defer
to
the
first
judge.
but
any
time
a
judge
can
reconsider,
there
is
no
problem
with
that.
the
law
of
the
case
in
the
5k
departure,
when
the
first
district
judge
heard
substantial
evidence
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
cooperation,
and
that's
what
he
did.
when
the
next
judge
heard
it,
she
heard
no
new
facts,
no
change
in
controlling
law,
and
absolutely
heard
no
evidence
with
regard
to--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--well,
that's
an
excellent
example
--
bound
by
--
but
have
you
had
to
look
at
the
law
of
the
case
and
make
a
decision
whether
or
not
new
facts
came
in,
there
was
a
change
in
controlling
law.
otherwise,
you
are
still
stuck
as
law
of
the
case
with
that
particular
information.
if
new
facts
came
in--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--even
with
the
original
judge.
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
new
facts,
a
change
in
controlling
law,
or
other
factors.
it's
a
basic
concept,
and
that's
why
a
lot
of
cases
are
not
floating
around
about
that.
plus
the
government--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--sure.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
absolutely.
that's
why
they
are
apples
and
oranges.
if
you
go
to
the
booker
decision
with
regard
to
mr.
pepper
--
and
mr.
pepper's
decision
is
under
the
remedial
remedy
that
we
are
asking
that
you
would
impose
in
that
case
--
mr.
pepper's
case
is
still
on
direct
appeal.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
restrictions
placed
upon
3742
(g)(2),
if
they
remain,
mr.
booker
would
not
have
gotten
the
advantage
of
the
remedial
ruling
in
the
case.
actually,
he
was
entitled
to
it
as
part
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
they
can
look
at
all
of
the
facts,
if
there
are
new
facts
presented.
the
difference
is,
in
the
law
of
the
case,
there
were
no
new
facts.
in
this
case,
there
were
new
facts
to
consider,
which
would
be
part
of
the
post-sentencing
rehabilitation.
in
that
issue,
the
eighth
circuit
rule
that
prohibited
this
was
not
even
part
of
the
3742(g)(2)
statute.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
well
--
well,
justice
scalia,
under
the
--
each
that
is
presented
to
the
court,
if
you
mix
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine
with
the
3742
problem,
it
creates
a
problem
in
analysis.
that's
why
they
have
to
be
analyzed
separately.
a
judge
can
look
at
new
facts,
even
under
the
remand
statute,
now
that
they
are
restricted
to
the
facts
that
were
part
of
the
first
case.
that's
what
3742(g)(2)
does.
it
makes
the
guidelines
sentences
mandatory
on
remand.
that's
the
problem
with
it.
if
they
become
mandatory
on
remand,
the
problem
is
that
nobody
gets
the
advantage
of
the
booker
remedial
ruling
of
it
directly,
and
all
sentences
on
remand
are
mandatory.
even
in
the
booker
decision,
you
make
it
--
in
which
mr.
pepper
was
a
recipient
of,
because
his
case
was
going
on
at
the
time
--
he
did
not
ever
get
the
benefit
of
the
booker
decision;
when
it
was
sent
back,
he
never
did.
mr.
booker,
under
3742(g)(2),
never
would
have
gotten
that
advantage.
and
there
were
several
other
factors
that
were
coming
into
play
where
people
would
not
get
an
advantage
of
the
booker
ruling.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
you
excise
it.
you
discussed
it
in
the
booker
decision.
and
in
the
booker
decision,
you
indicated,
justice
ginsburg,
that
you
exercised
two
of
the
other
--
3553(b),
you
also
exercise
--
excised
3742(e),
which
made
the
sentences
on
remand
mandatory.
in
this
case,
3742(g)(2)(a)
and
(b)
were
left
open.
and
what
happens
then,
the
district
court
judge
has
to
come
back.
once
they
look
at
the
decision,
they
are
bound
within
those
original
facts.
they
can't
go
outside
of
those
facts
to
decide
something
different
or
to
permit
a
variance.
the
eighth
circuit
didn't
use
that
rule.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
you
excise
that
rule.
you
excise
3742(g)(2)
and
you
excise
(a)
and
(b)
of
that
section.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
justice
alito,
congress
could
do
that.
unfortunately,
that's
not
what
they
did
in
this
case.
but
3742,
which
came
down
as
part
of
the
protect
act,
in
that
case,
booker
came
after
that.
so
consequently,
3742(g)(2)
is
problematic.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
it
does
not.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
well,
justice
alito,
let
me
give
you
an
example.
what
if
they
didn't
state
the
reasons
and
you
go
up
on
the
variance
from
the
district
court
decision
saying
you
didn't
get
the
stated
reasons?
the
appellate
court
then
sends
that
decision
back
and
the
judge
is
then
bound
by
those
facts.
and
if
they
didn't
find
all
the
facts,
suppose
again
they
went
up
on
a
presumption
that
the
guidelines
were,
in
fact,
reasonable.
in
that
instance,
you
wouldn't
get
anything
for
the
judge
to
work
from.
and
absolutely,
they
work
from
facts
now
within
the
guidelines.
you
take
the
stapleton
case
that
is
in
the
eighth
circuit
that's
cited
in
our
brief.
they
will
increase
the
guidelines
within
the
guidelines
on
new
facts,
but
you
can't
take
those
same
new
facts
and
then
use
them
to
assist
your
clients
under
3553,
which
goes
against
all
of
the
things--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--correct.
you
mean
under
the
post-sentencing
rehabilitation?
mr.
alfredo
parrish
they
have
it
as
a
policy
bar,
but
the
kimbrough
decision
really
indicates
that
the
courts
are
not
supposed
to
use
that
as
only
one
factor.
you
are
supposed
to
look
at
all
the
rest
of
the
factors.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--correct.
and
it
comes
right
out
of
the
eighth
circuit,
which
was
not
based
upon
empirical
data
like
a
lot
of
these
other
issues
are
based
on
that
they
create
as
policy
matters.
but
under
kimbrough,
you
said
policy
matters
are
only
one
consideration.
you
must,
in
fact,
look
at
all
the
other
factors.
you
also
said
it
in
reeder,
too.
you
are
not
bound
by
just
one
of
the
factors.
the
court
has
to
look
at
everything
in
order
to
be
able
to
make
a
decision
to
be
consistent
with
all
the
other
decisions
that
you
have
written
in
this
area.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
well,
in
that
instance,
the
question
is:
do
guidelines
accept
the
fact
of
some
disparity?
and
there
is
what's
called
warranted
disparity.
mr.
pepper
did
exactly
everything
that
we
want
a
person
convicted
of
a
crime
to
do.
he
exceeded
it.
and
in
that
instance,
if
his
case
comes
back
down,
it
doesn't
fall
on
any
concept
of
unwarranted
disparity.
there
is
a
difference.
there
is
a
difference
with
every
individual--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--but
our
guidelines
in
our
laws
make
situations
where
people
who
are
unique
and
who,
in
fact,
exceed,
don't
fall
into
a
separate
category
of
being
unwarranted
disparity.
the
emphasis
is
on
"unwarranted".
there
is
some
disparity,
and
if
a
person
is
unique
and
that
person
does,
in
fact,
under
3353
factors,
meet
all
of
the
things
that
require
us
to
look
at
a
person
as
an
individual,
that's
what
we
want
in
our
society.
and
that's
what
your
cases
--
3553,
3661
--
that's
what
they
indicate.
you
look
at
the
person
as
an
individual.
and
true
enough,
some
disparity
will
be
there,
but
it's
a
warranted
disparity.
and
it's
something
that
the
court
can
look
at,
along
with
all
the--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--well,
it
would
be
on
a
variance
and,
as
you
know,
under
the
gall
decision,
chief
justice
roberts,
you
can
look
at
all
of
the
other
factors.
in
the
departure
theory,
it's
a
little
different.
they
are
little
bit
narrower,
given
it's
more
restrictive,
and
there
are
other
factors
that
come
into
play.
under
the
variance
theory,
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
individual.
so
if
that
individual
can
demonstrate
that
they
have
made
improvements
--
not
just
gone
to
drug
classes,
but
completed
them
successfully;
not
just
worked
as
an
employee,
but
also
excelled
and
got
on
a
management
track;
not
just
went
to
college,
but
got
on
the
dean's
list
and
made
straight
a's
--
those
are
the
factors
that
we
want
these
individuals
to
have.
and
that's
why
3553(a)
allows
us
that
latitude,
and
3661,
which
is
a
long
history
based
upon
no
limitation
being
placed
upon
the
district
court
judge,
these
are
the
things
we
want
these
people
to
have--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--it's
not
a
guideline.
there's
a
policy
out
of
the--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--and
age,
and
factors
like
--
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
and
that's
the
grammar,
variance.
that's
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
the
eighth
circuit
created
it
out
of
whole
cloth
following
the
sims
case.
it
was
a
policy
that
was
actually
adopted
by
the
guidelines
in
the
year
2000.
prior
to
that,
there
were
about
8
circuits
that
allowed
post-sentencing
rehabilitation.
now
even
under
the
new
analysis,
there
are
about
6
circuits--
mr.
alfredo
parrish
--i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
absolutely.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
it
is
what
we
are
arguing
about,
not
about
the
policy,
because
they
didn't
even
use
that,
justice
scalia,
in
making
their
decision.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
thank
you
so
much.
mr.
alfredo
parrish
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
first
address
the
law
of
the
case
issue.
initially
i
said
it
was
apples
and
oranges,
and
it
is.
on
two
separate
occasions
after
the
5
k
ruling
had
been
made
by
district
court
judge
bennett,
it
was
appealed
twice
to
the
eighth
circuit.
after
it
was
appealed
twice
to
the
eighth
circuit,
they
had
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
they
could
have
used
to
resolve
it.
they
did
not
comment
on
it.
they
upheld
it.
then
it
was
sent
back
down.
after
it
had
come
up
on
an
original
writ
to
this
court,
this
court
vacated
the
eighth
circuit
opinion,
sent
that
opinion
back
down.
but
the
law
of
the
case,
as
you
said,
mr.
chief
justice
roberts,
still
remained
with
the
district
court
on
the
initial
ruling.
the
initial
ruling
that
judge
bennett
made
with
regard
to
the
5k
departure
was
a
separate
ruling.
now
the
eighth
circuit
in
its
own
analysis
of
how
you
interpret
its
remand,
we
disagree
with
the
government.
they
said
they
--
you
look
at
the
analysis
of
the
case
to
determine
the
remand.
and
in
that
instance,
we
believe
that
the
remand
was
the
analysis
of
the
case
that
the
5k
departure
remains.
no
new
facts
came
in,
no
new
controlling
law
came
into
place,
and
there
was
no
manifest
in
justice.
she
heard
no
new
facts
on
this
case.
we
believe
the
court
should
reverse
--
vacate
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
opinion
case
regarding
post-sentencing
rehabilitation,
remand
with
direction
from
this
court
consistent
with
an
opinion
that
requires
the
court
to
impose
a
sentence
that
does
not
exceed
24
months.
and,
justice
ginsburg,
we
did
mention
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
the
3742(g)(2)
as
a
footnote,
when
the
case
first
came
up.
but
the
eighth
circuit,
as
you
all
know,
did
not
use
that
rule.
they
used
an
old
rule
that
was
in
effect
from
the
sims
case
to
impose
the
sentence.
it
was
not
part
of
3742(g)(2)
or
any
other
statute.
