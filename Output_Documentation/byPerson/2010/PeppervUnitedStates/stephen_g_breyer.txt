justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
guideline
that
says
that
there
cannot
be
a
departure
for
rehabilitation
after
an
initial
sentencing
that
is
set
aside?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
so
there
is
no
guideline.
so
as
far
as
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
--
what
i
thought
her
question
was,
that
is
--
the
guidelines
initially
said
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
limit
departures,
but
it
doesn't
do
it,
except
for
race
and
gender--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
age.
that's
right.
so
under
the
guidelines,
a
judge
can
depart
for
any
reason
except
those
few
forbidden
things,
which
i
think
are
properly--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that's
still
the
law.
that's
still
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
the
circuits
that
have
made
this
thing
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
would
the
source
of
law
be
to
make
up
such
a
thing?
i
mean,
what
is
the
source
--
what
law
gives
the
right
to
the
--
to
a
--
a
circuit,
to
make
that
up,
would
have
to
say
it
was
an
unreasonable
thing
to
do.
now,
i
guess
you
could
have
an
argument
either
way
on
that,
but
it
doesn't
strike
me
off
the
bat
as
unreasonable,
where
a
person
has
rehabilitated
himself,
to
take
that
into
account.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we
would
have
the
power
to
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
guideline?
what
guideline
prohibits
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
because
look,
the
--
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case,
they
never
had
a
chance
to
consider
whether
booker
applies
or
not,
so
this
is,
i
think,
a
special
case.
but
think
of
3742(g)
in
general.
it's
pretty
easy
to
read
that
section
as
applied
to
instances
where
a
judge,
the
initial
sentencing
judge,
has
decided
on
his
own
volition
to
apply
the
guidelines
rather
than
not
to
apply
them.
now,
in
such
a
case,
he
sentences
the
individual.
there's
then
an
appeal,
and
the
appeal
he
is
reversed
on.
what
in
the
constitution
says
there
has
to
be
a
second
chance
to
decide
whether
the
guidelines
or
something
else
should
apply?
what
in
apprendi
says
that?
what
in
any
of
these
cases
says
that?
this
is
an
apprendi
problem.
as
you
know,
i've
dissented
throughout;
i
think
this
is
bad
policy,
but
--
i've
disagreed
with
everything,
but
forget
that
fact,
important
though
it
is.
[laughter]
but
the
--
the
thing
that's
worrying
me
about
--
and
i
don't
think
--
i
agree
with
you
on
policy,
but
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
having
trouble
with
is:
is
it
better
under
the
law
to
say
yes,
we
can
interpret
3742(g)
so
it
can
be
constitutional,
and
then
if
in
some
cases
it
violates
apprendi,
let
the
court
say
that
in
this
case
it
violates
apprendi.
but
it
just
isn't
clear
to
me,
which
is
why
i
left
it
alone
the
first
time.
it's
not
clear.
so
--
so
as
to
when
it
is,
when
it
isn't
constitutional.
you
got
my
whole
question
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
would
appreciate
as
much
answer
as
can
give
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
that
violates
apprendi?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
to
this
case
is,
i
don't
think,
too
hard.
you
say
it's
at
least
questionable
enough,
42(g)
you
could
say,
at
least
questionable
enough
that
it
is
the
same
box
as
the
ones
that
were
excised.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
there
has
not
been
focus
in
the
district
court
on
what
the
district
court
would
want
to
do,
assuming
he
is
free
to
apply
the
guidelines
or
not,
on
the
remand
decision
that
that
judge
has
never
made.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
say
--
forget
that
argument.
what
i
was
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
do
have
another
point
i
would
like
to
get
out,
as
long
as
i
have
this
opportunity.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
considerable
confusion,
perhaps,
only
from
my
point
of
view,
but
this
word
"variance"
--
i
mean
why
is
it
felt
necessary
to
use
the
word
"variance"?
if
it
is
true,
and
it's
not
totally
true,
but
if
it's
true
the
judge
--
you
can
apply
the
guideline,
apply
it.
now,
the
guidelines
themselves
gives
you
the
right
to
depart
in
every
single
case
but,
for
example,
a
handful
of
factors
such
as
race,
where
you
really
shouldn't
change
the
thing
just
because
of
race.
so
what
is
the
need
for
the
variance?
now,
maybe
this
5k9.
whatever
that
is,
maybe
there
are
a
handful
in
which
there
is
a
need,
and
maybe
this
is
an
example
of
it.
but
are
there
a
lot,
many,
what
--
can
you
just
talk
a
little
bit
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
just
a
policy
statement.
does
it
enjoy
the
same
status
of
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
all
those,
what
you
tend
to
do
is
take
the
parts
that
refer
to
the
other
statute
and
say
they
don't
do
anything.
and
does
that
ruin
the
provision
its
in,
the
answer
i
think
normally
is
no,
it
doesn't
ruin
it
at
all.
it
makes
sense.
but
this
one
is
a
tough
one.
i
grant
you
that
this
one
is
a
tough
one.
and
my
problem
of
course
is
i
can
think
of
a
constitutional
way
of
applying
this,
but
it's
a
little
far-fetched
and
the
far-fetched
one
makes
me
think
that
it's
unconstitutional
in
the
far-fetched
nature
of
it
and
i
don't
think
it
has
a
spillover.
the
far-fetched
one
was
the
one
that
was
brought
out.
not
far-fetched,
but
to
say
in
those
circumstances
that
it
is
constitutional,
where
they
are
going
to
apply
a
new
guideline
and
they
don't
have
the
evidence.
as
much
as
i
dissented
in
apprendi,
i
think
that
one
probably
does
violate
apprendi.
and
i
think
i
have
to
stick
up
for
that,
don't
i?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
can
check
a
box,
they
can
check
a
box
and
unless
they
are
going
to
depart.
now,
the
parts
that's
not
necessarily
to
deal
with
later,
the
part
that's
confusing
me
is
where
this
word
variance
comes
into.
because
i
think
the
word
departure
would
normally,
normally
cover
the
matter.
and
then
when
it
gets
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals,
whether
they
are
inside
the
guideline
or
outside
the
guideline
and
have
departed,
reviews
the
matter
for,
you
know,
inside
it
had
departed
or
outside,
those
situations.
it
says
in
booker
the
standard
is
to
review
for
reasonableness.
but
where
does
this
variance
business
come
in?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem,
to
be
very
specific,
is
i
think
the
following:
the
first
sentencing,
the
judge
applies
the
guideline.
he
says
there
was
$300,000
stolen
from
the
bank,
i
look
it
up
over
here
and
i
get
sentence
x.
on
appeal
the
appellate
court
says
you
should
have
counted
the
securities
as
money
taken.
so
it's
1,300,000.
so
go
and
apply
guideline
y.
he
goes
back
and
looks
at
y,
it's
a
very
high
number,
and
thinks
given
certain
circumstances
which
make
this
case
unusual,
i
want
to
depart
downward.
now,
i
would
have
thought
that
the
judge's
behavior
in
that
second
instance
would
have
violated
apprendi,
because
that
judge
was
either
going
to
sentence
even
without
the
departure
on
the
basis
of
him
having
taken
some
securities
worth
a
million
dollars
which
was
not
a
fact
that
went
to
the
jury.
there
it
is.
or
he
has
to
throw
aside
the
guideline.
but
this
statute
says
you
can't
throw
aside
the
guidelines,
and
you
can't
depart
for
a
reason
that
wasn't
previously
given.
so
this
statute
is
--
is
forcing
him
to
sentence
on
the
basis
of
a
fact
that
was
not
found
by
a
jury.
i
think
that's
the
argument
for
saying
it
violates
apprendi.
and
i
--
i
don't
see
why
it
doesn't.
