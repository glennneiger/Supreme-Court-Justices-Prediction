justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
it
be
consistent
with
booker
for
congress
to
pass
a
statute
that
says
the
following:
when
a
judge
initially
imposes
a
sentence,
the
judge
must
specify
all
of
the
factors
that
the
judge
thinks
are
relevant
to
that
sentence,
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
sentence
within
the
guidelines
or
a
sentence
that
is
outside
of
the
guidelines,
and
if
there
is
then
a
remand,
the
judge
may
impose
a
sentence
based
on
the
factors
that
were
listed
at
the
initial
sentencing
but
not
based
on
any
of
the
other
factors?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
exactly
what
3742(g)(2)
does?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
says
under
3553(c),
the
sentencing
judge
is
supposed
to
explain
the
factors
that
justify
the
sentence
that
is
imposed.
and
that
would
--
that
means
explain
a
sentence
outside
of
the
guidelines,
and
also
explain
why
the
judge
chooses
a
particular
sentence
within
the
guidelines
range.
we
have
--
3742(g)(2)
says
that
when
there
is
a
remand,
the
judge
may
take
into
account
all
the
factors
that
were
mentioned
the
first
time,
but
not
the
other
factors.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
that
mr.
pepper
had
an
identical
twin,
and
suppose
that
mr.
pepper
and
his
twin
engaged
in
the
same
criminal
conduct.
they
are
charged
with
the
same
offenses;
they
are
tried
together;
they
are
convicted
of
exactly
the
same
offenses;
they
are
sentenced
on
the
same
day.
between
sentencing
and
the
time
of
the
appeal,
they
rehabilitate
themselves
in
exactly
the
same
way.
the
twin
sentence
is
affirmed
on
appeal,
and
pepper's
sentence
is
overturned
and
he
gets
a
remand
for
a
new
sentence.
why
is
it
justified
for
mr.
pepper
to
get
credit
for
post-sentencing
rehabilitation,
but
his
twin
does
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
his
twin
did
everything
that
was
expected
of
him,
too,
but
he
doesn't
get
any
credit
for
the
rehabilitation.
he
just
gets
good
time
credit
for
good
conduct
while
he's
incarcerated.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
isn't
there
a
difference
between
evidence
that
--
evidence
of
conduct
that
occurred
prior
to
the
initial
sentencing,
but
wasn't
known
at
the
time
of
the
initial
sentencing,
and
evidence
of
conduct
that
occurs
between
the
initial
sentencing
and
the
resentencing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
maybe
it's
all
or
nothing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
maybe
it
works
both
ways,
that
the
defendant
doesn't
get
the
credit
for
good
conduct
between
sentencing
and
resentencing,
but
also
doesn't
get
punished
at
resentencing
for
unproven
conduct
that
occurs
between
the
first
sentence
and
the
next
--
and
the
second
sentence.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
under
3553(c),
the
court
is
supposed
to
explain
the
reasons
for
the
sentence,
even
if
it
is
within
the
guidelines;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
so
if
the
court
is
deciding
whether
the
sentence
should
be
57
months
or
63
months,
whatever
the
figures
were
that
you
gave.
the
court
thinks
that
some
factor
--
let's
say
age
is
significant
--
the
court
should
say,
i
am
sentencing
the
defendant
to
57
as
opposed
to
63
because
of
the
defendant's
advanced
age
or
young
age
or
whatever
it
is.
now
on
appeal,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
says
the
guidelines
sentence
was
improperly
calculated,
it
should
be
--
the
real
range
is
120
to
125
months,
remand.
now
if
the
court
wants
to
grant
a
departure
or
a
variance
based
on
age,
the
court
has
mentioned
age
previously
as
a
relevant
factor,
and
it
can
do
that.
but
if
age
was
not
--
if
age
was
not
relevant
to
the
determination
of
where
within
the
guidelines
this
sentence
should
be
set,
why
is
it
--
why
does
the
constitution
require
that
age
be
a
relevant
factor,
a
factor
that's
open
to
the
judge
on
resentencing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
just
the
notice
provision.
it's
not
--
it's
not
something
that
substantively
limits
what
the
court
can
do.
