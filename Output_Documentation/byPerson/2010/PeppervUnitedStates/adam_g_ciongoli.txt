mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
3742(g)
for
the
purpose
of
stopping
district
courts
from
evading
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
remanding
sentencing
cases
by
relying
on
grounds
that
they
did
not
consider
at
the
original
sentence.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
i
--
i
would,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
well,
i
think
one
thing
that
would
make
sense
of
it
is
there's
a
different
mechanism.
there
is
an
opportunity
for
that
to
be
reflected
in
a
--
in
a
separate
criminal
prosecution
and
a
--
and
a
sentencing
for
that
conduct.
when
--
when
the
sentencing
guidelines
were
created
and
when
3742(g)
was
passed,
all
of
this
was
done
against
the
backdrop
of
a
sense
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
were
to
focus
on
avoiding
unwarranted
disparities,
but
as
the
court
observed
in
booker,
sentencing
similar
--
similar
sentences
for
similar
crimes
conducted
in
similar
ways.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
the
purpose
of
3742(g)
is
to
limit
the
ability
of
the
district
court
to
evade
the
mandate
on
remand
in
sentencing.
and
i
think
that
purpose
was
valid
before
booker,
and
i
think
it's
actually
even
more
important
after
booker.
if
you
are
going,
for
example,
to
have
meaningful
opportunities
for
the
government
to
appeal.
if
a
district
court
can
impose
a
sentence
that
the
court
of
appeals
then
finds
substantively
unreasonable,
and
on
remand
the
district
court
can
then
consider
grounds
that
didn't
exist
at
the
time
of
the
original
sentencing,
and,
in
fact,
couldn't
have
been
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
evidence
didn't
exist
at
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
it.
and
in
this
case
it's
uniquely
in
the
hands
of
the
defendant
to
create,
then
you
are
going
to
create
essentially
a
procedural
merry-go-round
where
a
district
court
will
impose
a
24
month
sentence,
the
government
will
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
will
think
that
is
substantively
unreasonable,
it
will
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
and
they
will
say,
well,
in
the
interim
this
person
has
rehabilitated
them
self,
they
have
gotten
a
job
and
they've
gone
to
school.
the
government,
and
i'm
imposing
another
24
month
sentence.
these
are
not
related
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
but
this
is
a
different
hypothetical.
the
government
will
then
appeal
again
and
say
this
is
ridiculous.
the
underlying
conduct
is
extremely
severe,
24
months
is
substantively
unreasonable
and
they
will
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
will
say
we
agree
it's
substantively
unreasonable
and
we
will
get
a
remand
for
resentencing.
and
the
district
court
will
say,
well,
not
only
has
he
gone
to
school
and
not
only
does
he
have
a
job,
but
he's
gotten
married
and
he
has
been
promoted
and
he
has
been
named
employ
of
the
year,
so
i
am
imposing
a
24
month
sentence
again.
and
at
some
point
the
government
is
going
to
say,
i
give
up,
because
i
could
keep
appealing,
but
what's
the
point,
it
appears--
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
--that's
right,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
think
that
both
purposes
are
served
by
3742(g).
3742(g)
as
both
the
petitioner
and
the
government
serves
a
constitutional
purpose.
what
both
the
petitioner
and
the
government
object
to
is
the
way
that
it's
drafted.
it's
not
that
congress,
they
say,
couldn't
pass
this,
but
that
they
couldn't
pass
it
the
way
that
it
is
passed
because
it
makes
essentially
illegal
references
to
the
mandatory
sentencing
guidelines.
that
is
a
product
of
the
fact
that
this
statute
was
drafted
before
booker
and
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
knowing
how
booker
was
going
to
come
out.
what
the
court
i
think
needs
to
decide
is
post
booker
how
it's
going
to
deal
with
statutes
like
3742(g),
and
there
are
others,
which
stand
for
an
entirely
constitutional
and
important
purpose,
but
which
necessarily,
because
of
the
time
they
were
drafted,
have
references
to
or
language
that
assumes
the
existence
of
a
mandatory
guidelines
scheme.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
well,
i
can
think
of
at
least
three
problems
that
would
result
from
the
court
saying
that
any
reference
to
a
mandatory
guidelines
scheme
creates
--
creates
essentially
a
facial
invalidity
if
it's
incapable
of
constitutional
review.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
well,
first
of
all,
3553(a)
makes
two
references
to
3742(g).
so
there's
a
question
as
how
you
would
apply
those
if
you
strike
3742(g).
i
think
that
3553(c),
to
the
extent
that
it
requires
a
written
statement
in
the
context
of
a
departure,
starts
to
raise
questions.
and
as
justice
scalia
points
out
in
his
dissent
in
booker
itself,
there
is
a
real
question
as
to
whether
3742(f)
has
any
reason
to
exist
after
booker.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
justice
breyer,
if
you
are
referring
to
the
solicitor
general's
hypothetical
of
a
case
in
which
they
miscalculate
the
guidelines
and
they
don't
announce
their
reasons
otherwise,
i
actually
think
there
is
a
way
to
avoid
the
problem
depending
on
whether
the
point
arises
before
or
after
this
case.
if
it
arises
after
this
case,
i
think
it
will
be
very
clear
to
the
district
court's
that
they
need
to
be
careful
and
thorough
in
articulating
their
reasons
for
reaching
the
sentence,
which
particularly
in
a
post
booker
world,
i
think,
is
a
good
thing.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
i
think
having
a
district
court
articulate
it's
reasons
is
a
good
thing.
they
are
supposed
to
do
that
under
congressional
statute
now,
3553(c),
they
are
supposed
to
do
that
in
open
court
very
clearly
and
in
certain
circumstances
they
are
supposed
to
do
it
--
they
are
supposed
to
do
it
in
writing.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
i
think
in
the
context
of
3742(g)
that's
one
of
the
linguistic
vestiges
of
the
guidelines,
which
is
that
up
until
irizarry
the
court
itself
used
the
terms
variance
and
departure
interchangeably
because
a
variance
didn't
exist
prior
to
booker.
the
court
obviously
spoke
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
going
to
equate
a
variance
and
a
departure
in
the
context
of
rule
32(h)
in
irizarry.
i
don't
think
actually
that
that
distinction
was
essential
to
the
holding
in
irizarry
and
i
think
could
be
limited
there.
i
think
particularly
where
the
court
is
trying
to
avoid
invalidating
a
duly
enacted
statute,
some
flexibility
in
terms
of
interpreting
departure
in
3742(g)(2)(b)
would
be
warranted
and
you
would
essentially
say
that
to
the
extended
that
a
court
is
varying
or
departing,
that
they
would
need
to
articulate
the
reasons.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
obviously
the
court
is
dealing
very
clearly
with
the
constitutionality
of
it
now.
and
i
think
that
congress
had
very
good
reasons
for
enacting
it
that
continue
to
be
valid.
it's
capable
of
constitutional
application,
i
think
in
the
mine
run
of
cases,
and
in
particular
in
this
case.
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
allegation
in
this
case.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
justice
breyer,
i
--
i
think
that
in
--
in
certain
applications
of
this
statute
there
will
be
problems.
i
--
i
think
that's
unavoidable
and
i
think
it's
an
unavoidable
consequence
of
having
been
drafted
before
booker.
the
question
is
how
the
court
is
going
to
address
that.
is
the
court
going
to
read
the
statute
flexibly?
is
--
is
it
going
to
interpret
it
in
a
way
that
tries
to
avoid
those
circumstances,
those
constitutional
problems?
or
does
it
ultimately
determine
that
it
is
--
it
is
essentially
not
capable
of
a
saving
construction.
i
think
it
is
capable
of
a
saving
construction;
i
think
it
is
capable
of
a
saving
construction
in
a
couple
of
ways
that
avoid
most
of
the
problems
that
have
been
articulated
by
--
by
both
petitioner
and
government.
the
first,
which
actually
petitioner
points
out
in
his
reply
brief,
is
in
3742(g)
itself,
there
is
this
language
about
"except
that",
that
appears
to
limit
the
--
the
ability
of
the
district
court
to
actually
follow
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
think
that
that
can
be
read
to
limit
the
mandate
in
the
court
of
appeals,
nor
do
i
think
that
anyone
is
suggesting
that
3742(g)
changes
the
rule
in
harper
v.
virginia
department
of
--
of
taxation,
the
idea
that
--
that
district
courts
obviously
would
have
to
give
the
benefit
of
intervening
changes
in
--
in
law
in
judicial
decisions;
and
so
booker
which
has
been
used
as
an
example,
booker
on
remand
would
likely
have
been
entitled
to
a
--
a
resentencing,
a
resentencing
based
on
factors
that
the
district
court
judge
could
have
considered
at
the
time
of
the
original
sentencing,
but
now
in
light
of
booker,
basically
a
do-over.
and
for
a
--
for
a
small
section
of
cases,
i
think
that
would
work.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
justice
scalia
i
think
i
said
it
would
be
problematic;
i
don't
think
i
conceded
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
there
are
--
there
are
some
circumstances
where,
by
a
strict
read
of
--
of
(g)(2),
the
court
would
be
required
to
apply
the
guidelines,
a
guidelines
range.
and
the
example
that
--
that
the
solicitor
general's
office
gave
might
be
the
best,
which
is
where
you
have
a
circumstance
where
the
district
court
has
imposed
a
sentence
within
the
guidelines
range,
has
not
given
any
other
reason
for
a
variance,
the
sentence
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
range
which
may
or
may
not
indicate
that
they
thought
that
the
--
that
the
sentence
should
be
at
the
low
end;
and
then
on
a
--
on
a
calculation
there
is
a
determination
that
the
--
on
appeal
there
is
a
determination
that
the
calculation
was
incorrect;
and
on
remand
the
district
court
says,
i'm
--
i'm
bound
by
this
new
calculation,
and
i'm
giving
you
a
mandatory
sentence.
i'm
giving
you
--
i'm
bound
by
the
guidelines
range
because
i
didn't
give
any
other
reasons.
i
didn't
give
any
other
reasons
under
--
under
(2)(a),
and
therefore
i
can
only
give
you
a
guidelines
sentence.
and
in
those
cases
the
guidelines
would
be
mandatory.
and
under
booker
i
think
there
is
--
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
a
court
can
impose
a
mandatory
sentence
in
any
case
after
booker.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
i
--
i
--
i
certainly
think
the
court
could
take
that
approach,
and
--
and
in
fact
i
think
to
--
i
think
to
--
i
think
it
should.
i
think
that
the
court
should
find
a
way
to
read
or
construe
3742(a)
to
be
constitutional,
because
it
serves
an
important
and
independent
policy
choice
that
has
been
identified
by
congress.
mr.
adam
g.
ciongoli
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
you
are
pointing
out
that
there
is
some
tension
which
i
have
admitted.
i
think
that
again,
this
statute
was
drafted
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
different
set
of
assumptions,
and
so
there
may
--
there
may
be
applications
which
create
some
difficulty.
they
create
more
difficulty
in
terms
of
how
it
is
applied,
but
they
are
not
the
kinds
of
difficulties
that
i
think
are
insurmountable.
and
they
are
certainly
not
the
kinds
of
difficulties
that
support
what
i
think
is
--
is
a
proposed
broad
solution
by
both
the
petitioner
and
the
government,
that
post
booker,
sentencing
statutes
which
--
which
impose
a
mandatory
guideline
sentence
really
in
any
applications
are
facially
unconstitutional.
i
--
i
don't
read
booker
that
way,
i
don't
think
the
court
intended
it
that
way.
certainly
the
remedial
holding
in
booker
doesn't
indicate
that.
if
it
did
--
if
that
is
in
fact
what
the
remedial
holding
in
booker
stands
for,
i
think
the
--
the
implications
are
more
far
reaching
than
the
court
--
the
court
intended.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
