justice
antonin
scalia
even
with
the
original
judge?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
there
are
new
facts
or
some
--
some
new--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
one
--
one
of
the
new
facts
that
--
that
is
before
a
judge
on
remand
is
that
part
of
the
basis
for
his
decision
has
been
eliminated.
he
--
he
gave
additional
time
because
of
a
certain
factor,
and
the
court
of
appeals
says:
oh,
no,
you
can't
look
at
that
factor.
and
then
he
looks
at
the
whole
thing
and
says:
gee,
without
that
factor
this
guy
is
getting
off
scot-free.
you
mean
he
cannot
--
he
cannot
readjust
his
other
discretionary
judgments
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
additional
factor
doesn't
exist?
that
seems
rather
--
i
don't
--
counterintuitive,
i
guess.
justice

what
about
3742(g)(2)?
that's
what
we're
arguing
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
your
fourth
point?
i
am
all
on
pins
and
needles
waiting
for
your
fourth
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
how?
would
--
would
you
explain
as
concisely
as
you
can,
why
you
think
that
(g)(2)
would
be
unconstitutional
in
--
in
some
limited
category
of
cases,
and
how
that
can
be
avoided
by
what
you
call
a
flexible
interpretation?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
--
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
you
read
that
simply
to
have
been
overcome
by
the
holding
of
booker,
that
you
apply
--
that
every
judge
has
to
apply
3553
factors
and
decide
the
ultimate
sentence
on
the
basis
of
those
factors?
i
mean,
isn't
that
what
booker
said,
and
why
wouldn't
you
apply
that
to
--
to
(2)(a)
and
(b)
as
well?
