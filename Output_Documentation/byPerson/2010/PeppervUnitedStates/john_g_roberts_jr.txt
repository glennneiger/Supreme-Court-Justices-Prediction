chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
09-6822,
pepper
v.
united
states.
mr.
parrish.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
think
you
--
i
think
you
have
got
a
difficult
job
navigating
between
your
two
issues.
it
seems
on
the
first
one,
the
40
percent
to
20
percent,
you
are
saying:
look,
you've
got
to
stick
with
what
you
did
before;
and
when
it
gets
to
the
post-sentencing
consideration,
you
are
saying:
well,
we
can
--
all
bets
are
off,
we
can
start
--
start
anew;
we
can
look
at
things
that
have
happened
since.
is
there
a
way
you
reconcile
that
--
those
--
that
tension?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
kind
of
a
fortuitous
situation,
then.
you
are
sort
of
saying
if
you
end
up
with
the
same
judge,
she
can
reconsider
her
own
prior
determination.
but
if
you,
for
whatever
reason,
the
death
of
the
first
judge,
you're
in
a
different
judge;
she's
bound
by
what
went
before.
that
doesn't
seem
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
--
it's
warranted
that
the
one
get
the
benefit
and
it's
unwarranted
that
the
other
does
not.
i
mean,
the
departure
in
the
case
of
the
one
who
gets
reconsideration
is
warranted,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
disparity
is
warranted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
mcleese.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
perhaps
before
your
time
is
up,
you
would
like
to
address
the
first
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
has
nothing
--
but
what
if
the
appeal
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
at
all?
i'm
thinking
in
--
the
analogy
in
a
civil
context,
so
you
have
two
totally
unrelated
issues.
if
you
appeal
issue
b
and
that
is
what
the
fight
is
about,
and
you
reverse
and
send
back,
it
would
at
least
be
unusual
for
judge
to
say,
well,
and
by
the
way,
i'm
coming
out
the
other
way
on
issue
a.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
these
are
not
interconnected,
are
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
my
point
is
that
the
level
of
assistance
is
not
in
any
way
connected
to
the
post-sentencing
conduct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
why
--
why
does
that
matter
when
you
are
talking
about
two
totally
unrelated
issues?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
court
of
appeals
thinks
there
ought
to
be
or
any
issue
with
respect
to
the
question
a
when
they
focus
solely
on
question
b.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
you
are
worried
about
the
general
rule,
but
you
agree
that
none
of
these
arguments
make
any
sense
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
not
interfere
with
the
new
judges
or
the
judge's
discretion
across
the
board?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
never
had
to
sentence
someone,
but
it
seems
to
me,
particularly
when
you
have
a
change
in
the
judges,
there
is
a
very
personal
investment
in
what
you
do
with
the
--
the
defendant,
and
to
say
that,
well,
another
judge
looked
at
this
factor,
so
your
hands
are
tied
in
that
respect
is
--
is
a
questionable
result.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
reason
to
suppose
when
they
say
de
novo
resentencing,
they
are
talking
about
the
mistake
that
was
made
with
respect
to
the
issue
b
and
not
issue
a?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
they
--
is
it
their
practice
in
some
cases
to
say
we
are
sending
this
back
for
de
novo
sentencing,
but
only
with
respect
to
the
issue
that
we
addressed,
or
do
they
just
normally
throw
it
out
and
say
start
over,
without
any
supposition
that
the
district
court
would
take
a
look
again
at
something
that
wasn't
before
the
court
of
appeals
at
all?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
they
--
are
you
aware
of
any
case
where
the
eighth
circuit
has
said,
we
are
sending
this
back
for
resentencing
but
only
on
the
issue
that
we
addressed
on
appeal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
ciongoli?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
parish,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
ciongoli,
you
have
briefed
and
argued
this
case
as
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
judgment
below
at
the
invitation
of
the
court
and
have
ably
discharged
your
responsibility.
the
case
is
submitted.
