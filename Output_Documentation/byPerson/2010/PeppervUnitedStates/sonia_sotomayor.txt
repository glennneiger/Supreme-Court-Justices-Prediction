justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
i'm
--
i'm
a
little
confused.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
that
the
entire
premise
of
booker
was
that
judges
should
have
full
discretion
under
3553
to
balance
the
factors
that
are
required
by
the
statute
to
be
balanced
and
to
come
to
what
they
believe
is
the
appropriate
sentence.
if
we
impose,
in
a
resentencing,
in
a
remand
order
that
has
vacated
a
prior
sentence,
a
limitation
on
that
power,
don't
we
in
turn
do
exactly
what
you
are
arguing
in
your
first
half
of
your
appeal,
which
is
unconstitutionally
tie
the
hands
of
the
judge?
i
think
that
is
what
justice
--
the
chief
justice
was
getting
to
in
his
first
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
a
new
sentence
just
that:
a
new
sentence?
and
the
judge,
whoever
the
judge
is,
can
do
what
they
are
supposed
to
do,
which
is
to
look
at
all
of
the
factors
and
weigh
them
as
that
judge
believes
is
appropriate,
assuming
the
remand
order
is
not
a
limited
order.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
as
far
as
you
are
concerned,
justice
alito's
question
about
post
--
post-sentencing
criminal
conduct
couldn't
be
considered
by
a
court,
either?
because
it
wasn't
a
factor
mentioned
in
the
original
sentence,
so
you
would
apply
the
rule
equally?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
any
logic
to
that?
i
mean,
i
know
that
when
i
was
a
district
court
judge,
routinely
post
sentencing
criminal
conduct
would
make
me
wonder
whether
this
person
really
was
worthy
of
a
lower
sentence
or
not,
or
of
whatever
largesse
i
may
have
given
him
or
her
in
original
sentence.
what
makes
sense
about
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
this
provision
was
passed,
congress
was
worried,
i
thought,
about
the
situations
where
district
court
judges
has
--
were
on
appeal
till
--
you
can't
use
this
ground
for
departure,
and
often
the
court,
because
they
thought
the
original
sentence
they
gave
was
fair,
would
then
articulate
another
ground
for
departure
that
they
hadn't
earlier.
but
wouldn't
that
all
go
out
the
window
with
booker?
i
mean,
the
presumption
that
drove
congress
was
that
the
guidelines
were
mandatory.
once
booker
said
they
weren't,
why
should
we
be
limiting
congress
--
a
judge's
discretion
at
an
issue
or
post
hoc
to
giving
what
they
believe
is
a
reasonable
sentence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
of
those
statutes
are
left
that
the
court
hasn't
looked
at?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
are
the
three?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
that
--
i
mean
--
we
right
now
are
receiving
hundreds
of
petitions
saying
the
court
didn't
sufficiently
articulate
its
reasons.
we're
going
to
change
the
practice
of
the
district
court.
i
mean,
dramatically.
you
think
that's
a
good
thing
to
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
october
2003,
petitioner
jason
pepper
plead
--
pled
guilty
to
federal
drug
charges.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
set
aside
his
initial
sentence
in
light
of
our
decision
in
u.s
v.
booker,
which
invalidated
certain
statutory
provisions
that
made
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
mandatory.
on
remand,
the
district
court
held
the
resentencing
hearing.
pepper
testified
that
while
he
had
previously
been
a
drug
addict,
he
had
successfully
completed
a
drug
treatment
program
while
in
prison
and
no
longer
used
any
drugs.
he
also
testified
that
he
was
enrolled
in
community
college
and
had
earned
a's
in
all
of
his
classes
the
prior
semester,
and
was
also
working
part-time.
pepper's
father
testified
that
he
had
previously
been
strangled
from
his
son,
but
the
two
had
since
reestablished
their
relationship.
pepper's
probation
officer
also
testified
on
the
positive
steps
pepper
had
taken
in
becoming
a
law
abiding
citizen
and
has
demonstrated
little
recidivism
raise
--
risk.
in
light
of
this
testimony,
the
district
court
sentenced
pepper
to
24
months.
the
court
of
appeals
again
set
aside
the
sentence
ruling
that
pepper's
postsentencing
rehabilitation
could
not
be
considered
at
resentencing
and
directed
that
the
case
be
assigned
to
a
difs
--
different
district
judge.
at
the
second
resentencing
hearing,
pepper
informed
the
new
district
judge
that
he
was
still
in
school
and
was
now
working
at
sam's
club
where
he
was
recently
selected
"an
associate
of
the
year"
and
was
about
to
be
promoted.
he
also
testified
that
he
had
married
and
was
supporting
his
new
family.
the
district
court
however,
refused
to
consider
this
evidence
and
sentenced
pepper
to
65
months
of
imprisonment
which
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
grant
this
certiorari
and
now
vacate
that
portion
of
the
judgment
below.
the
court
has
longed
recognized
that
highly
relevant,
if
not
essential,
to
the
selection
of
an
appropriate
sentence
is
the
possession
of
the
fullest
information
possible
concerning
the
defendant's
life
and
characteristics.
will
--
this
proposition
is
supported
by
williams
v.
new
york.
congress
codified
this
principle
at
18
u.s.c.
section
3661,
which
provides
that
"no
limitation
shall
be
placed
on
the
information",
a
sentencing
judge
can
consider
concerning
the
defendant's
background,
character,
and
conduct.
and
at
section
3553,
which
sets
forth
certain
factors
that
certain
sentencing
courts
must
consider,
including
"the
history
and
characteristic
of
the
defendant."
we
hold
that
a
district
court
at
resentencing
may
consider
evidence
of
the
defendant's
postsentencing
rehabilitation,
and
that
such
evidence
may
in
appropriate
cases,
support
a
downward
variance
from
the
guidelines'
range.
the
eight
circuit's
decision
to
the
contrary
conflicts
with
longstanding
principles
of
federal
sentencing
law
and
congress'
express
directives
in
sections
3661,
and
3553(a).
although
a
separate
statutory
provision,
section
3742(g)(2)
would
effectively
preclude
the
consideration
of
postsentencing
rehabilitation.
that
provision
did
not
survive
our
holding
in
booker
and
we
expressly
invalidate
it
today.
separately,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling
that
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine
did
not
require
the
district
court
in
this
case
to
apply
the
same
percentage
departure
from
the
guidelines
range
for
substantial
assistance
that
had
been
applied
at
pepper's
prior
sentencing.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
is
vacated
in
part
and
affirmed
in
part.
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
resentencing
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
a
part
--
in
part,
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
thomas
has
filed
this
dissenting
opinion.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
