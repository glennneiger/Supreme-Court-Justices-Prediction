mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
valid
basis
to
categorically
bar
variances
under
the
--
variances
from
the
guidelines
based
on
post-sentencing
rehabilitation.
that
is
true
for
four
primary
reasons.
first,
it's
undisputed
that
post-sentencing
rehabilitation
is
logically
irrelevant
to
statutory
sentencing
factors
in
3553(a),
including
the
need
for
deterrents
and
the
need
to
protect
the
safety
of
the
community.
second,
the
guidelines
themselves
authorize
consideration
of
presentencing
rehabilitation
to
a
limited
extent,
because
it's
permissible
under
the
guidelines
to
consider
presentencing
rehabilitation
in
selecting
a
sentence
with
inside
the
guideline
range.
what
the
guidelines
do
prohibit,
and
there
is
a
provision
in
the
guidelines
that
does
prohibit
the
--
a
departure
from
the
guidelines
based
on
post-sentencing
rehabilitation.
the
guidelines
prohibit
that,
but
the
judgment
of
the
commission
about
how
much
weight
that
factor
can
be
given
after
booker
in
an
advisory
guideline
regime
is
advisory
rather
than
mandatory.
third--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--5k2.19.
and
third,
contrary
to
the
suggestion
of
the
amicus,
there
is
no
general
principle
in
our
law
that
at
a
resentencing,
new
information
may
not
be
considered.
to
the
contrary,
the
consistent
assumption
of
the
law
is
that
at
a
resentencing,
you
take
the
defendant
as
you
find
him
as
of
the
time
of
resentencing.
that
is
clear
from
this
court's
decisions
in
pierce
and
in
wasman.
it
is
clear
from
the
large
body
of
cases
from
the
lower
courts
cited
in
petitioner's
brief
at
pages
42
through
44.
that's
the
way
the
guidelines
operate,
so
there
is
no
general
principle
that
you
cannot
consider
new
information.
now,
it's
true,
as
justice
alito's
question
suggested
earlier,
that
that
can
result
in
differences
of
opportunity,
where
one
defendant
will
have
an
opportunity
for
a
resentence
and
new
information
will
be
considered
as
to
that
defendant;
a
similarly
situated
defendant
will
not
get
a
resentencing.
but
that
opportunity
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
"luck".
first,
can
be
good
luck
or
bad
luck,
and
to
take
the
example
justice
alito
gave
of
two
twins,
if
you
have
an
example
of
two
defendants
who
are
twins
who
are
each
convicted
of
an
offense
--
let's
say
burglary
--
and
they
are
given
very
lenient
sentences,
and
because
the
judge
looks
at
their
record
at
the
time
and
determines
that
they
are
sympathetic.
they
are
don't
have
a
prior
criminal
record.
one
of
them's
conviction,
you
know,
has
no
claims
of
legal
error
relative
to
his
conviction;
he
gets
no
resentencing.
the
other
gets
a
resentencing.
by
the
time
of
resentencing,
it
has
become
clear
that
that
defendant
had
previously
committed
several
murders,
and
he's
--
you
know,
murdered
--
has
also
committed
a
subsequent
murder.
there
is
no
question
that
at
that
resentencing,
that
information
would
be
considered.
there
is
no
question
there
would
be
a
disparity,
and
it
would
be
true
even
if,
let's
say,
those
earlier
murders
had
been
committed
by
both
of
the
twins
together.
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
there
could
be,
but
again
--
maybe
going
too
far
with
the
example
of
the
two
twins,
if
the
two
twins,
while
they
were
serving
--
let's
say
they
got
lenient
sentences,
but
not
probation.
while
they
were
serving
in
jail
together,
they
murdered
a
correctional
officer.
if
one
of
the
defendants
does
not
get
a
resentencing,
if
one
of
those
twins
does
not,
there
will
be
no
opportunity
for
that
to
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
his
brother
gets
a
resentencing--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--that's
a
possible
rule
of
law,
but
my
point
was
that's
not
the
rule
of
law
we've
ever
had.
that's
not
the
--
and
i
should
say,
nor
is
it
the
rule
of
law
that
is
created
by
3742(g)(2),
because
3742(g)(2)
is
not
a
rule
about
consideration
of
new
evidence.
it's
an
anti-departure
provision.
it
permits
consideration
of
new
evidence,
and
it
permits
these
kinds
of
--
if
you
--
disparities,
whether
warranted
or
not,
because
it
permits
consideration
of
new
evidence
in
determining
the
guidelines'
range,
new
evidence
about
loss
amounts
or
--
or
whatever.
it
permits
consideration
of
new
evidence
as
it
might
relate
to
upward
adjustments
or
downward
adjustments,
as
it
might
relate
to
criminal
history.
what
it
forbids
is
new
variances
or
departures.
so
37422(g)(2)
does
not
implement
some
general
policy
with
respect
to
new
evidence,
nor,
should
i
say,
to
the
guidelines,
because
as
i
said,
the
guidelines
permit
consideration
of
post-sentence
rehabilitation
in
setting
a
guideline
range.
they
reflect
a
judgment
not
about
the
disparities
always
trumping
other
considerations,
including
accuracy
in
sentencing,
but
only
how
much
weight
that
those
disparities--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--no.
apologies.
the
fourth
point
is
simply
that
3742(g)(2),
if
valid,
would
foreclose
consideration
of
post-sentencing
rehabilitation,
but
after
booker
it
is
not
valid,
and--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--it
would
be
invalid.
it
would
be
invalid
because
it
would
be
--
as
applied
in
certain
circumstances,
it
would
unconstitutionally
constrain
the
authority
of
judges
at
resentencings
and
also
be
--
with
booker.
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
i
do.
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
take
an
example
that
is
in
the
briefs.
if
at
an
original
sentencing
a
judge
determines
the
guideline
range
and
ends
up
calculating
it
to
be
relatively
low
--
57
to
73
months,
which
probably
aren't
even
exact
numbers
--
and
determines
that
that's
an
appropriate
sentence,
and
although
the
defendant
is
urging
various
factors
as
a
basis
for
downward
--
for
variance
from
the
guidelines,
the
judge
determines
that
there
is
no
reason
to
vary
because
this
is
a
sentence
that
seems
reasonable.
so
although
those
reasons
might
well
be
persuasive
in
some
contexts,
they
aren't
given
the
range
now.
the
government
takes
an
appeal
and
argues
to
the
court
of
appeals:
in
fact,
the
judge
was
wrong;
the
guideline
range
is
much
higher.
and
so
on
remand
at
the
resentencing,
the
judge
makes
some
factual
determinations,
not
found
by
the
jury
or
admitted
by
the
defendant,
which
increase
the
guideline
range
under
the
new
advice
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
a
guideline
range
of
121
to
151
months.
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
well,
if
the
judge
then
says:
i
would
like
to
vary
from
the
guidelines;
i
am
locked
under
the
guidelines
to
a
121-month
sentence,
and
i
have
--
i
didn't
--
it's
true
i
didn't
vary
before
on
these
grounds,
but
that's
because
the
sentence
didn't
author
--
didn't
warrant
--
because
of
relative
lack
of
severity,
did
not
warrant
a
variance,
i
think
that
the
--
the
logic
of
apprendi
and
booker
would
foreclose
constraining
resentencings
in
that
way.
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
and
i
think
that's
an
answer.
if
i
could
just--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--i
think
that's
an
answer
to
the
question
that
you
asked
earlier,
which
is,
i
think,
if
congress
enacted
a
statute
which
categorically
said
that
whatever
happens
at
the
original
sentencing,
the
judge
has
to
list
any
reason
that
the
judge
is
relying
for
a
downward
variance
or
departure,
and
then
cabins
the
judge
on
a
remand,
that
in
certain
contexts
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
this
court's
line
of
cases
from
apprendi
through
booker.
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
yes.
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
well--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--to
clarify,
a
judge
is
required
to
state
in
open
court
orally
the
reasons
for
a
sentence
inside
the
guideline
range,
only
if
the
range
is
sufficiently
large,
and
the
written
statement
of
reasons
does
not
require
--
the
reasons
for
selecting
a
sentence
within
the
guideline
range
are
not
required
to
be
in
the
written
statements
of
reasons.
the
written
statement
of
reasons
applies
only
to
grounds
outside
the
--
the
guidelines.
and
to
--
from
a
practical
perspective
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
expect
sentencing
judges
to
list
every
conditionally
or
contingently
relevant
fact
depending
on
whatever
sentence
ultimately
comes
back
on
remand,
that
might
be
relevant
to
a
reason
to
depart
from
a
range
that
the
judge
is
not
contemplating
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing.
ut
i
should
say
also
that
if
--
the
answer
to
this
question
of
better
congress
could
reenact
3742(g)(2)
after
booker,
and
it
would
be
constitutional
or
not
constitutional
as
applied
in
certain
settings
is
not
essential
to
our
point,
because
the
appeal
provisions
that
were
excised
in
booker
were
not
determined
by
the
court,
they
were
not
excised
because
the
court
determined
they
would
be
independently
constitutional.
the
remedial
component
of
the
booker
opinion
was
focused
on
the
question
of,
having
found
a
constitutional
violation,
what
then
do
we
do
to
remedy
it,
and
what
the
court
said
was
the
way
we
will
remedy
this
is
that
we
will
make
the
guidelines
advisory
rather
than
mandatory.
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
and--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--yes,
and
to
elaborate
on
that--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--just
--
just
by
its
terms,
section
3742(g)(2)
is
inconsistent
with
the
remedial
rule
announced
in
booker,
which
was
that
the
guidelines
would
be
advisory
rather
than--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--but
more
specifically--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--it's
two
points
with
respect
to
that.
one
of
which
is,
this
is
a
provision
where
the
--
the
commission
has
specifically
said
it
is
not
lawful
to
depart
on
this
basis,
though
it
is
permissible,
again,
to
sentence
within
the
range--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--correct.
yes,
they
are
treated
--
in
the
era
when
the
guidelines
were
treated
as
mandatory,
they
were
treated
as
guidelines
in
return.
there
are
other
guidelines
provisions
about
departures
which
either
foreclose
other
bases
or
which
will
say
they
were
not
usually
or
ordinarily
a
basis
for
departure.
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
and,
so,
there
still
is
litigation
in
a
post
mandatory
guideline
system
about
whether
it
is
a
correct
application
of
the
guidelines
to
on
this
basis.
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
yes.
with
respect
to
the
law
of
the
case
issue,
as
it
has
been
framed
by
the
--
the
--
the
briefs
by
petitioner
on
the
merits
in
this
court,
it
is
an
extremely
narrow
issue;
and
that
is,
taking
as
a
given
that
the
eighth
circuit
had
authority
to
order
de
novo
resentencing
and,
in
fact,
it
did
order
de
novo
resentencing
was
at
that
resentencing,
the
district
court
--
the
resentencing
district
court
judge
bound
by
the
earlier
judge's
discretionary
determination
that
the
substantial
assistance
provided
by
defendant
pepper
justified
a
40
percent
reduction.
and
to
ask
that
question
is
to
answer
it
in
the
sense
that
the
phrase
"de
novo"
means
anew
or
afresh.
and
the
point--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--and
that
is
true
in
the
civil
setting.
courts
have
taken
the
view
that
sentencing
is
different
because
sentencing
is
a
relatively
discreet
proceeding
where
there
are
a
number
of
interconnected
determinations,
a
lot
of
them
discretionary,
based
on
the
judge's
assessment,
a
lot
of
them
conditionally
relevant
to
each
other--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--well,
the
amount
of
substantial
assistance
that
is
given
in
a
particular
case
can
easily
be
connected
to
antecedent
determinations,
including
what
the
guidelines
level
is.
since
judges
often--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--these
two
issues
are
not
interrelated,
but
i'm
explaining
the
reason
for
of
the
doctrine
in
the
sentencing
setting.
the
greater
willingness
of
courts
of
appeals
to
order
de
novo
resentencing
and
say
even
though
the
particular
issue
on
court
of
appeal
does
not
directly
open
up
the
other
issues
that
may
have
been
determined
at
sentencing,
judges
in
the
--
courts
of
appeals
in
the
sentencing
context
all
agree
they
have
authority
to
order
de
novo
resentencing
where
they
think
it's
appropriate.
and
they
tend
to
think
it
is
more
appropriate
in
the
sentencing
context
than
generally,
because
as
i
said--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--because
also--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--i
agree.
but
again,
when
the
court
of
appeals
orders
de
novo
resentencing,
that
doesn't
open
up
only
substantial
assistance.
the
point
is,
the
judge
is
going
to
go
through
and
as
of
the
time
of
the
resentencing,
determinations
on
the
situation
as
it
existed
at
that
time.
so,
it
is
possible
and
not
at
all
unusual
that
issues
that
were
not
up
in
the
court
of
appeals
will
come
up
on
resentencing.
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
i
--
i
agree
that
it
would
have
been
permissible
for
the
court
of
appeals
here
to
choose
not
direct
a
de
novo
resentencing
that
would
have
been
a
permissible
way
to
resolve
the
issue
as
well--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--i
--
i--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--i
agree.
and
i
should
say
that
the
issues
that
we
are
discussing
are
interesting
ones,
but
they
are
not
the
law
of
the
case
issue
that
is
being
presented
here.
because,
in
fact,
the
eighth
circuit
did
order
de
novo
resentencing,
the
defendant
has
never
challenged
the
validity
of
their
ordering
de
novo
resentencing,
so
the
only
issue
is
what
does
it
mean
for
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine
when
de
novo
resentencing
is
ordered?
and
on
that
question,
it
is
very
clear.
in
fact,
not
just
the
eighth
circuit
but
every
court
of
appeals
that
we
are
aware
of
to
resolve
that
question
has
said
that
as
the
name
suggests
when
the
circuit
chooses,
for
whatever
reasons,
to
order
de
novo
resentencing,
the
--
the
judge
at
resentencing
is
not
bound
by
earlier
determinations
of
the
district
court
judge.
and--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--no,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that.
but
what
there
is
reason
to
suppose--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--different
circuits
approach
that
somewhat
differently,
but
all
circuits
have
--
understand
that
they
have
authority
to
make
individualized
case
determinations
and
they
do.
there
are
cases
where--
mr.
roy
w
mcleese
iii
--yes.
and
the
eighth
circuit's
opinions
make
clear
that
although
they
apply
sort
of
a
default
presumption
that
there
will
be
de
novo
resentencing,
they
make
clear
that
they
have
authority
to
order
limited
resentencings.
and
they
do
that
where
in
a
particular
case
they
think
it
is
more
efficient
or
more
appropriate.
they
explained
in
this
case,
by
the
way,
with
the
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
you
made
earlier,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
part
of
the
reason
they
thought
de
novo
resentencing
was
appropriate
here
is
because
they
were
reassigning
the
matter
to
a
different
judge,
and
therefore,
i
think
for
some
of
the
reasons
that
you
were
suggesting,
they
felt
de
novo
review
was
appropriate.
but
again,
on
the
narrow
law
of
the
case
issue
that
is
presented,
there
is
no
disagreement
among
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
as
the
name
suggests,
if
there
is
a
de
novo
resentencing,
the
matter
is
de
novo.
if
i
could
for
just
a
moment
turn
back
to
the
post-sentence
rehabilitation
issue
to
make
one
last
point,
which
is
going
one
level
deeper
into
the
booker
remedy
analysis
again,
even
