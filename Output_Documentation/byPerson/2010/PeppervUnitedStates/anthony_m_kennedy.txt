if
congress
reenacted
3742(g)(2)
tomorrow,
would
it
be
valid?
justice

but
there
are
two
explanations
for
your
hypothetical.
one
is
there
has
been
a
real
change
that
affects
the
judge.
the
other
is
where
you
began,
i
thought
you
were
going,
where
the
judge
is
evading
the
court
of
appeals.
those
are
two
different
things.
one
may
happen,
one
may
not.
