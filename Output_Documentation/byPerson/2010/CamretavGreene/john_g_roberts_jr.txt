chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-1454,
camreta
v.
greene,
and
09-1478,
alford
v.
greene.
general
kroger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
just
do
that.
is
--
is
mr.
camreta
in
any
more
comfortable
position
when
he
knows
that
the
ninth
--
what
the
ninth
circuit
thinks
on
this
issue
and
he
just
has
to
wait
until
there's
another
case
when
they
can
impose
the
view
that
they've
already
spelled
out?
i
know
as
a
technical
matter
it's
not
binding,
but
if
you're
camreta,
do
you
say,
well,
the
supreme
court
vacated
that
decision,
so
i
can
go
ahead
and
do
this
again
and
not
have
to
worry
about
personal
liability?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they're
supposed
to
file
circuit
--
follow
circuit
precedent,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
merits--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--do
you
think
that
the
same
approach
you're
following
here
would
apply
if
the
investigation
focused
on
the
student
rather
than
a
third
party?
would
in
those
cases
a
warrant
have
to
be
obtained?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
not
another
child.
it
could
be
anything.
we
think
the
child
is,
you
know,
selling
drugs,
obviously
not
a
7-year-old,
but
someone
else
in
the
school
is
involved
in
illegal
activity,
him
or
herself.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
you
think
it
would
be
a
different
rule
if
we're
talking
about
some
other
criminal
activity?
the
father's
selling
drugs,
and
you
think
the
child
might
have
some
evidence
or
at
least
be
willing
to
talk
about
that.
do
you
need
anything
other
than
reasonableness
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
would
be
a
partial
vacatur,
right?
the
court's
done
that
before,
hasn't
it,
where
we
vacate
part
of
a
decision
under
munsingwear?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
he
was
correct.
the--
[laughter]
if
it's
vacated,
it
indicates
that
there's
no
established
law
on
that
question,
and
it
seems
to
me
camreta
would
be
free
to
do
what
he
considered
appropriate
under
the
circumstances,
and
if
somebody
tries
to
impose
personal
liability
on
him,
it
seems
he
has
an
even
stronger
case
than
he
might
have
before.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
kubitschek.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
why
are
you
--
why
are
you
here?
[laughter]
you're
not
challenging
the
qualified
immunity
ruling?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yet,
you
have
--
yet,
you
have
--
why
didn't
you
just
go
away?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know
that.
but
why--
[laughter]
i
do
know
that.
but
on
the
other
hand,
you
had
no
--
you
could
have
filed
a
paper
saying
we
have
no
continuing
interest
in
the
case,
but
you
haven't
done
that.
you've
fought
the
legal
issues
on
the
merits
in
--
in
an
area
where
it's
been
suggested
you
don't
have
a
stake.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
have
objection
if
we
entered
a
munsingwear
order
vacating
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
merits
of
the
dispute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
again--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
again,
i
get
to
the
question,
why
do
you
care?
why
do
you
care
whether
we
vacate
the
--
the
order
or
not?
your
position
is
your
client
has
no
continuing
interest
in
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
was
not
trying
to
help
you.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
that's
your
argument,
again,
that
we
shouldn't
reach
the
merits?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
do
you
agree
that
if
we
vacate
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
on
the
merits,
that
if
camreta
had
did
exactly
what
he
did
in
this
case
again,
that
he
would
not
face
personal
liability?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
then
that
cannot
be
used
--
that
cannot
be
used
to
establish
that
there's
clearly
established
law.
and
in
the
absence
of
clearly
established
law,
he
cannot
be
found
personally
liable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
he
did
exactly
the
same
thing,
he
would
still
be
entitled
to
qualified
immunity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
who
is
--
who
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
county?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
claim
pending
below
involves
which
two
parties?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh.
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--does
the
decision
on
the
merits
here
have
any
relevance
whatever
to
the
action
that's
still
pending?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
agree
that
if
--
if
this
is
--
we
vacate
the
decision
on
the
merits,
that's
of
no
meaning
whatever
in
the
pending
action
below?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you're
making
an
argument
on
something
that
you've
already
told
us
you
have
no
cognizable
interest
in
--
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
kroger,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
