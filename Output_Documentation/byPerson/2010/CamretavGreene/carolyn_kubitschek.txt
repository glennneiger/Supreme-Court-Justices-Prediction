ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
case
or
controversy
between
s.g.
and
the
petitioners.
that
ended
when--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--precisely.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
not
here
voluntarily.
[laughter]
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
we
--
s.g.
does
not
have
a
legally
cognizable
stake,
your
honor.
she
won
a
moral
victory
when
she
obtained
a
ruling
in
her
favor
on
the
fourth
amendment
claim
in
the
ninth
circuit,
but
as
this
court
said
in
hewitt
v.
helms,
a
moral
victory
is
no
victory
at
all,
but--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--well,
your
honor,
the
--
we
would
submit
that
the
munsingwear
test
would
not
apply
in
this
case
because
munsingwear,
which
permitted
vacating
a
decision
when
it
became
moot,
talked
about
decisions
which
become
moot
through
happenstance,
and--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--the
reason
for
that
is
because
of
preclusion.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
that
--
our
client
has
no
legally
binding,
legally
cognizable
interest
in
the
case.
she
has
an
interest
in
protecting
her
moral
victory,
as
do
--
and
in
the
issue,
as
do
the
many
amici
who
filed
briefs
on
her
behalf.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
that
--
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
she
does
not
have
an
interest,
and
the
case
is
moot.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
your
honor,
the
--
the
case
--
if
the
case
is
truly
as
important
to
other
employees
of
the
states
in
--
within
the
confines
of
the
ninth
circuit,
it
will
arise
again,
and
this
court
will
have
the
opportunity
to
decide
the
issue
again
between
parties
who
have
a
live
stake
in
the
issue;
or
it
will
arise
in
another
circuit,
and
it
will
present
a
live
controversy
between
parties
who
have
a
stake.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
no,
your
honor,
we
would
not
ask
the
holding
below
be
erased.
that's--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--i'm
sorry--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
misspoke.
it
will
come
up
--
if
it
is
as
--
if
the
practice
is
as
widespread
as
the
petitioners
claim,
it
will
come
up
again
in
other
circuits,
and
this
court
will
have
the
opportunity
to
review
it
and--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--well,
your
honor,
i
guess
that's--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--well,
your
honor,
that
leads
to
the
question
of
what
exactly
are
they
bound
by?
and
our
reading
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
not
nearly
as
broad
as
the
petitioners'
reading.
the
court
of
appeals
said
specifically
our
caseworkers
and
police
officers
are
always
allowed
to
question
children
in
a
protractive
custodial
setting
with--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--that
was
--
that
was
the
ruling
as
it
applied
to
s.g.
herself,
justice
ginsburg.
this
was
not
a
class
action
lawsuit,
and
the
court
was
deciding
what
happened
to
one
9-year-old
child
on
february
24th,
2003.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
okay.
on
page
1022,
your
honor,
it
says:
"we
consider
the
relatively
straightforward
question
whether
an
in-school
seizure
and
interrogation
of
a
suspected
child
abuse
victim
is
always
permissible
under
the
fourth
amendment
without
probable
cause
and
a
warrant
or
the
equivalent
of
a
warrant.
"
and
the
court
--
and
the
court
said:
no,
not
always
and
not
in
this
case.
and
if
this
court
does
reach
the
merits
of
--
of
this
case,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
uphold
a
rule
that
--
stating
that
a
protracted
custodial
interview
of
a
child
by
police
and
child
welfare
investigators
is
presumptively
unconstitutional
unless
they
have
a
warrant
or
court
order
or
parental
consent
or
exigent
circumstances.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
length
of
the
questioning
has
been
historically
important
to
this
court's
jurisprudence.
it
distinguishes,
for
example,
between
a
terry
stop
and
a
seizure.
and
this
court
said,
for
example,
in
the
united
states
v.
place,
that
a
90-minute
detention
is
--
falls
out
of
the
realm
of
a
terry
stop
and
into
the
realm
of
a
seizure
for
which
full
fourth
amendment
protections
are
required
of
a
criminal
suspect.
and
this
court
has
also
said,
in
soldal
v.
cook
county,
that
it
would
be
anomalous
if
people
who
are
not
suspected
of
any
wrongdoing
at
all
had
fewer
fourth
amendment
protections
than--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--we
would--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--the
--
i
didn't
mean
to
--
that
the
length
of
the
interview
is
the
only
factor,
your
honor.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
one
of
the
other
factors
is
that
the
--
that
the
seizure
is
determined
by
the
fact
that
the
police
and
child
welfare
worker
removed
the
child
or
removed
any
individual
from
the
place
where
she
is--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--and
bring
her
to
another
place,
and
then--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--that
--
that
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
seizure.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
in
this
case,
it
was
stipulated
that
there
was
a
seizure.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
that
--
that
if
--
if
it
were
very
brief
and
the
child
was
not
removed
from
her
classroom--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--our
position
would
be
that
because
the
--
of
the
importance
of
consent
here
to
a
seizure,
that
the
--
that
there
would
need
to
be
a
court
order
to
remove
a
child
from
her
classroom
and
to
take
her
to
another
room
and
then--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--or
parental
consent.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
i
think
that
has
been
our
position,
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
didn't
make
it
clear.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
well,
the
way
that
we
read
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
the
rule
that
we
would
ask
this
court
to
adopt,
that
is,
seizure
and
for
a
custodial
interrogation
is
presumptively
unreasonable
without
parental
consent
or
a
court
order
leaves
open
the
possibility
that
there
are,
in
fact,
some
children
who
are
of
suitable
age
and
discretion
to
knowingly
make
a
decision
whether
or
not
to
talk
to
an
armed
police
officer
and
a
caseworker
without
their
parents
having
to
make
it
for
them.
but--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--a
seizure,
yes,
but
that
would
have
exigent
circumstances,
and
that
would
get
it
out
of
the
warrant
requirement.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
well--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--that
--
that's
correct.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
what?
yes,
there
was
a
seizure.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
that's
--
that's
correct.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
correct.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
well,
it
would
depend
on,
i
think,
the
larger
picture,
whether
or
not
there
was
police
entanglement,
as
this
court
ruled
in
ferguson
v.
the
city
of
charleston.
in
this
particular
case,
the--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--well,
and
this
--
this
court
recognized
also
that
possibility
in
ferguson
v.
the
city
of
charleston,
that
the
--
the
nurses
at
the
hospital
would
call
child
protective
services,
but
the
--
the
--
you
have
to
look
at
it
from
the
beginning,
and
in
this
case,
the
case
began
when
--
on
february
10th,
when
the
police
got
involved.
the
police
did
not
report
the
matter
to
the
child
protective
investigator
until
10
days
later,
and
then
they
went
out
together.
subsequently,
the
child
protective
investigator
testified
before
a
grand
jury
as
part
of
the
ongoing
law
enforcement
investigation
and,
in
fact,
when
he
was
questioned
at
his
deposition,
petitioner
alford
said
that
his
reason
for
being
at
the
school
was
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
no,
it
would
not
be
the
same
if
it
was
the
school
nurse
or
mr.
camreta.
and
the
--
the
reason
is
that
the
school
nurse
is
part
of
the
school
administration,
and
the
school
has
an
obligation
and
the
authority
under
t.l.o.
act
and
in
earls
to
make
rules
and
carry
out
procedures
that
will
protect
the
children
of
the
school
and
promote
learning,
and
if
the
child
comes--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--if
mr.--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--if
mr.
camreta
came
in
from
the
outside,
he
would
not
fall
within
the
t.l.o.
rule,
because
in
t.l.o.
this
court
said
specifically
that
their
ruling
does
not
apply
to
individuals
such
as
police
officers
who
come
from
the
outside
in
--
in
order
to
deal
with
situations
that
are
not
related
to
the
school,
and
nobody
is
saying
that
s.g.
was
abused
while
she
was
at
the
school.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
if
--
if--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--the
school
nurse?
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
probably
not
a
seizure.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
if
the
outside
person
comes
into
the
school--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--that's
one
of
the
factors
to
look
at.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
yes.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
--
it
would
be
considered
a
seizure,
although
that's
not
our
case.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
that
--
that,
your
honor,
it
might
be
a
seizure.
again,
it's
t.l.o.--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--if
--
if
the
caseworker
comes
to
the
school
under
circumstances
where
a
child
would
feel
free
to
leave
or--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--well,
your
honor,
that's
--
children
--
this
is
correct,
children
have
lesser
expectations
of
privacy,
but
when
they
are
forcibly
taken
out
of
class
and
moved
to
another
location--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--that
--
that
would
be
--
your
honor,
if
that
is
a
seizure,
it
would
fall
within
t.l.o.,
precisely
within
t.l.o.,
whereas--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--well,
your
honor,
the
t.l.o.
framework
would
certainly
apply
in
that
situation,
where
you
have
a
child
who
has
a
potentially
contagious
disease,
then
the
analysis
you
follow--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--your
honor,
that
certainly
also
would
fall
within
the
t.l.o.--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--special
needs
exception.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
well,
your
honor,
because
child
welfare
investigations
are
also
harmful
to
children.
and
when
--
when
a
child
is
asked,
interrogated
about
whether
or
not
her
father
touches
her
inappropriately,
that's
not
a
neutral
action.
whether
or
not
she
has
been
abused
that
causes
trauma
to
the
child--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--if
--
if
there--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--they
--
they
affect
the
constitutionality
of
the
interaction
between
the
child
and
the--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--well,
your
honor,
because--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
i'm
aware
of
that.
but,
you
know,
that
again
is
perhaps
a
good
reason
why
this
court
should
not
reach
the
merits
of
the
fourth
amendment
question,
because
in
this
particular
case
it
was
conceded
that
there
was
a
seizure
so
early
in
the
--
in
the
case
that
the
normal
development
of
facts
which,
as
justice
scalia,
you
have
pointed
out,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
seizure
is
certainly
dependent
on
the
individual
facts
of
the
encounter
between
the
individual
child
and
the
individual
police
officer.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
those
facts
were
not
developed.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
that's
correct.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
if
you
--
if
you
vacate
the
decision
on
the
merits--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--that
--
that
would
be
correct.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
he
would
still
be
entitled
to
qualified
immunity,
but
if
this
court
were
to
vacate,
this
court
would
be
effectively
be
telling
lower
courts
that
they
should
not
follow
the
pearson
sequence
ever
because
if
they
--
if
the
lower
court
reaches
a
constitutional
issue
and
then
rules
that
the
defendant
has
qualified
immunity,
which
pearson
said
that
they
could
do,
that
this
court
would
then
say
no,
don't--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--well--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--which
is
--
that's
--
that's
correct--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--it
--
it's
a
different
situation,
but
if
they're
in
the
situations
where
individual
defendants
have
qualified
immunity,
it
has
been
the
procedure
in
this
court
not
only
since
pearson
but
really
going
all
the
way
back
to
siegert
v.
gilley,
1991,
where
the
court
recommended
that
the
lower
courts
reach
the
constitutional
issue
--
in
siegert
this
court
said
that
they
can.
in
county
of
sacramento
v.
lewis,
the
court
said
that
they
--
it's
the
better
approach.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
s.g.
could
have
cross-petitioned,
but
she
decided
not
to.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
the
monell
action
against
the
municipality
was
dismissed
on
the
facts.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
the
motion
to
reinstate
it
was
denied
without
prejudice
to
reinstate
after
this
court
rules,
and--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--it's
still
alive.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
that's
correct.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
that
is
against
deschutes
county,
justice
kagan.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
i'm
sorry;
who's
on
the
other
side
of
the--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--oh,
it
--
it
involves
s.g.
and
the
county.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--claim
that
it's
alive?
the
claim
that
is
alive
involves
different
incidents,
incidents
that
took
place
in
march
of
2003,
not--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--no.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
it
would
not
have
an
effect
on
the
action.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
if
the
court
were
to
dismiss
the
case
as--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--well,
your
honor,
it
would
have
some
impact
at
least
on
the
petitioner's
position.
the
petitioner's
opinion
as
stated
in
their
brief
that
all
seizures
of
children
to
investigate
child
abuse
are
constitutional
at
their
inception,
meaning
there
--
there
are
no
limits,
there
are
no
constraints
on
what
a
child
abuse--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--and,
your
honor,
that--
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
--that
would
be
to
--
to
tell
the
officials
who
investigate
child
abuse
that
in
the
name
of
protecting
children,
they
do
not
have
free
rein
to
do
anything
and
everything
that
they
think
is
appropriate,
because
what
they
do
harms
children,
including
the
very
children
they
claim
to
be
trying
to
protect.
as
justice
breyer
said,
even
raising
those
questions
would
--
would
be
beneficial
to
children
who
are
forced
to
undergo
child
abuse
investigations,
75
percent
of
whom
have
not
been
abused
at
all,
and
who
find
the
experience
psychologically
traumatic.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
correct.
ms.
carolyn
a.
kubitschek
well,
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
--
most
of
the
states
have
a
procedure
for
seeking
court
approval,
and
their
--
they
differ
in
whether
they
require
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
or
something
like
reasonable
cause;
and
so
while
we
put
in
our
brief
that
the
seizure
of
s.g.
should
have
been
based
upon
