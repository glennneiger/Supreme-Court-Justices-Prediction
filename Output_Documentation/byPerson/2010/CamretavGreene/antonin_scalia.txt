justice
antonin
scalia
not
so
fast.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i
was
about
to
ask
is
this:
i
can
agree
with
you
that
--
that
where
there
is
a
--
a
determination
on
the
merits,
it
should
be
reviewable,
but
could
still
disagree
that
it's
reviewable
where
the
requirements
for
article
iii
are
not
met;
that
is,
where
there
is
really
no
justiciable
controversy
between
the
parties.
what
--
what
is
the
interest
of
the
--
of
the
parties
who
were
victorious
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
takes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
takes
two
to
tango,
and
a
case
or
controversy
requires
somebody
on
the
other
side
who
cares
a
fig
about
the
outcome.
and
here,
s.g.,
who
was
the
--
the
young
woman
affected
in
the
case,
has
moved
to
another
state
and
--
making
it
virtually
certain
that
she'll
never
confront
this
situation
again.
she
doesn't
care
what
the
result
of
this
thing
is.
besides
which,
i
think
she's,
what,
17
years
old
or
so
now?
it's
impossible
that
she
will
be
confronted
with
the
same
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
it
affect
the
fourteenth
amendment?
there's
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim
pending
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
the
substance
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
make
you
happy,
won't
it?
won't
that
make
you
happy?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
different
panels
on
the
ninth
circuit,
aren't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
they
don't
all
hold
the
same
thing,
fortunately,
do
they?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
an
opinion
that
is
vacated
is
not
circuit
precedent,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
a
dissent
in
that
case,
wasn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
wouldn't
be
the
case
if
the
opinion
were
vacated--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
munsingwear?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
what's
the
test?
isn't
the
test
clearly
established
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
this
be
clearly
established
law
under
any
--
any
conceivable
interpretation
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
want
us
--
so
munsingwear.
you
don't
want
us
just
to
leave
it
sitting
because
there's
no
controversy;
you
want
us
to
erase
that
holding
below,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
--
then
the
answer
you
just
gave
doesn't
make
any
sense.
you
say
it
can
--
you
know,
it
can
arise
again.
that
would
be
the
answer
of
someone
who
wants
us
to
eliminate
the
holding
here:
don't
worry;
it
will
come
up
again
in
a
context
where,
on
appeal,
somebody
will
have
an
interest
in
arguing
to
--
to
sustain
it,
but
that
interest
doesn't
exist
here.
that's
the
argument
you're
making,
but
that's
the
argument
of
someone--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
wants
us
to
munsingwear.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
it
seems
like
a
very
strange
rule
to
me.
you
mean
it's
okay
for
a
child
protection
worker
to
just
ask
the
child
passing
in
the
hall,
you
know,
has
your
--
or
not
passing
in
the
hall.
come
into
this
room,
i
have
a
question
for
you:
has
your
father
been
abusing
you?
and
if
the
child
says
yes,
thank
you,
and
the
child
goes,
then
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
was
a
short
interview?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
take
her
into
a
room.
i
see
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
once
they
take
her
in
a
room,
it
depends
on
how
long
the
interview
is;
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
about
rules
for
the
future;
we're
not
talking
about
this
case,
and
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
a
rule
for
the
future
that
says
if
it's
very
brief,
it's
okay,
but
if
it's
longer
it
isn't
okay.
right?
that's
what
you
want
us
to
adopt?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
no.
removed.
there
has
been
a
seizure,
but
it's
been
a
very
brief
seizure,
just
as
a
terry
stop
is
a
very
brief
seizure.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
changing
your
position:
you
need
a
court
order,
no
matter
how
brief;
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
send
her
to
the
school
nurse,
it's
not
a
seizure,
but
if
the
school
doesn't
have
a
nurse
and
it
brings
in
a
nurse
from
the
outside
and
say,
you
know,
we
think
you
have
some
contagious
disease,
we
would
like
you
to
speak
to
this
--
then
it
becomes
a
seizure?
justice
antonin
scalia
contagious,
it's
just
a
disease
that's
going
to
kill
this
child
and
nobody
else,
okay?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
doesn't
it
--
likewise,
it's
not
a
nurse,
but
it's
a
social
worker
who's
brought
in
to
interrogate
the
child
about
something
else
that
is
going
to
very
much
harm
that
child,
why
is
that
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
there's
a
seizure,
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
whether
there's
a
seizure.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
questions
you
ask
after
the
seizure
don't
make
it
a
seizure
or
make
it
not
a
seizure,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
she's
helping
you,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
she's
helping
you,
i
think.
[laughter]
but
--
but
that
goes
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
seizure.
i
was
asking
you
about
whether
there
has
been
a
seizure.
step
one,
has
there
been
a
seizure?
and
you're
saying
that
in
a
lot
of
these
situations
there
simply
hasn't
been
a
seizure.
now,
once
there
is
a
seizure,
then
we
can
inquire
to
whether
it's
unreasonable
or
not.
but
--
but
those
are
two
distinct
questions,
and
--
and
we've
been
discussing
the
mere
existence
of
a
seizure.
now,
true
in
this
case
it
was
already
conceded,
but
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
a
rule
for
future
cases,
and
we
can't
adopt
a
rule
for
future
cases
until
we
know
what
we're
talking
about
when
--
when
--
when
we
talk
about
a
seizure.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
always.
only
when
there
is
no
longer
a
case
in
controversy.
in
--
in
many
cases
there
will
still
be
a
case
or
controversy.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
will
be
something
that
could
be
replicated
again
in
the
future
for
some
other
reason.
it
--
it
isn't
true
that
it
will
just
eliminate
the
whole
purpose
of
our
--
of
our
jurisprudence
in
this
area.
in
many
cases
the
--
the
decision
below
can
be
appealed,
and
--
and
we
will
rule
on
the
--
on
the
constitutional
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
moved
away,
i
mean
if
--
you
know,
it's
a
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
then
walking
along
the
hall
in
the
school,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
come
up
alongside:
"by
the
way,
i
wanted
to
ask
you
whether
your
mother
--.
"
[laughter]
