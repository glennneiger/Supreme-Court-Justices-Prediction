justice
sonia
sotomayor
general--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
--
the
county's
claim?
how
camreta
does
his
job
doesn't
--
that
claim
doesn't
belong
to
him;
it
belongs
to
the
entity
who
is
telling
him
how
to
do
his
job.
and
so
why
don't
we
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
of
why
isn't
the
monell
situation
the
proper
case?
because
there,
it's
the
party
interested
in
how
its
officers
will
do
their
job
at
its
directive.
it
has
the
case
and
controversy
at
issue,
not
s.g.--
right
now,
she's
never
going
to
be
investigated
again.
she's
in
another
state.
i
understand
that
she
doesn't
even
ever
want
to
return
to
oregon
for,
probably,
fairly
good
reasons,
at
least
from
her
perspective.
so,
again,
why
isn't
this
the
interests
of
the
county,
not
--
not
the
interests
of
the
officer?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
if
we
were
to
hold
this
case
was
moot,
what
would
--
what
do
you
think
the
appropriate
disposition
of
the
case
would
be?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
don't
really
want
that,
because
the
ninth
circuit
granted
qualified
immunity.
what
would
be
--
what
would
we
be
vacating?
they
haven't
rendered
a
judgment
on
the
search
warrant
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
vacate
the
opinion.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
we
told
them--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
would
--
i'm
interrupting
you
only
for
a
quick
reason.
what's
the
test?
is
it
a
question
of
whether
the
seizure
is
reasonable
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
--
so
that
would
be
your
proposed
test.
if
we
were
to
say
you
don't
need
any
of
those
three
things
right
now,
where
would
that
leave
us
or
leave
the
courts
below
on
determining
whether
what
happened
here
was
reasonable
or
not?
meaning,
what
if
a
child
is
called
in
and
says,
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you
without
my
mom;
and
they
continue
to
speak
to
the
child?
is
that
reasonable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
we--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
do
we
develop
the
law,
or
how
do
we
help
develop
the
law
in
this
case
if
we
answer
your
question
but
leave
unanswered
with
no
parameters,
any
idea
--
because
we
have
no
set
of
facts;
no
one's
going
to
review
that
question
--
of
what
is
reasonable
in
this
context?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
--
you
see,
that's
the
problem
with
taking
up
a
case
with
no
case
in
controversy,
because
what
do
we
do?
we
don't
remand
for
them
to
reach
the
second
question,
which
is
really
the
one
that
law
enforcement
needs
some
help
on.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
are
you
--
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
position.
answering
justice
scalia's
question:
child
walks
into
the
room
--
is
taken
out
of
their
classroom,
walks
into
the
room.
the
officer
says:
we've
heard
that
your
mommy
and
daddy
are
doing
some
things
to
your
private
parts;
is
that
true?
and
the
child
says
--
9-year-old
child
says:
i
wish
somebody
had
asked
me
before.
i'm
so
afraid
of
my
daddy.
he
does
these
horrible
things
to
me.
are
you
seriously
suggesting
that
if
the
police
stay
there
for
an
hour
debriefing
that
child
as
to
the
circumstances
of
that
situation,
that
that's
a
seizure?
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
or
change
the
police
bringing
a
child
into
a
room
and
just
asking
the
question?
when
does
--
that's
what
you
seem
to
have
said
to
justice
scalia,
which
is
that
the
mere
removal
from
the
classroom
is
the
--
the
defining
feature
of
seizure.
so
it
can't
be
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
don't
know
if
there's
exigent
circumstances
until
they
ask
the
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
doesn't
that
go
to
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
scope
of
the
seizure?
don't
we
have
lidster
and
--
and
other
jurisprudence
that
basically
addresses
this
question
and
says
is
this
type
of
seizure
or
stop
detention
reasonable?
and
it's
hard
to
swallow
that
if
a
police
officer
asks
a
child
are
you
being
abused
and
the
child
says,
yes,
i
need
help,
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
think
that
that
seizure
is
unreasonable.
you're
--
you're
--
you're
--
it
may
well
be
that
2
hours
for
a
protesting
child
would
be,
but
isn't
that
all
subject
to
a
question
of
reasonableness
as
to
the
scope
of
the
seizure?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
just
a
point
of
clarification
before
you
go
on.
you
said
earlier
that
your
office
had
advised
the
county
not
to
seize
children.
does
that
mean
they're
not
talking
to
children
at
all?
is
--
you
used
the
word
seized.
are
you
advising
them
that
they
don't
have
the
right
to
talk
to
children?
without
their
parental
consent
or
a
warrant?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
standard?
i
mean,
i
just
assume
you're
not
suggesting
that
this
procedure
could
be
used
with
every
child
in
every
school
without
some
ground
for
suspicion,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you
--
are
you
--
and
i
guess
what
i'm
asking
is,
let's
assume
we
go
ex
ante.
at
any
moment
that
an
agency
speaks
to
a
child,
they
can
move
from
a
nonseizure
to
a
seizure,
correct?
and
some
seizures
can
be
reasonable
and
some
can't,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
law
enforcement
is
never
going
to
know
where
that
line
of
reasonableness
or
unreasonableness
is,
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
in
--
that's
in
the
nature
of
doing
this
without
a
warrant,
isn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they
do
it
anyway,
meaning
even
if
we
say
that
they
can
seize
the
child,
you
would
still
have
to
not
do
a
seizure
that
was
unreasonable.
you
wouldn't
--
in
scope.
they
can't
speak
to
the
child
endlessly,
can
they?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
quite
sure
why
you
stipulated
to
a
seizure
in
this
case,
but
that
was
your
strategic
choice.
