ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
number
of
the
questions
this
morning
have
focused
on
the
question
whether
a
live
case
or
controversy
remains
because
respondent
has
chosen
not
to
challenge
the
ninth
circuit's
qualified
immunity
ruling
and
so
purportedly
has
no
continuing
stake
in
the
resolution
of
this
controversy.
we
think
that
that's
not
correct
for
the
reasons
general
kroger
has
given,
but
it's
also
not
an
irreducible
minimum
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
correct
the
mistake
that
the
ninth
circuit
made
in
this
case.
i
think,
too--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
two
responses,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
as
general
kroger
mentioned,
she
has
a
continuing
interest
in
how
this
court
resolves
this
controversy
because
of
her
attempt
to
bring
the
same
fourth
amendment
claim
against
deschutes
county.
but
setting
that
aside,
this
court
hasn't
universally
required
that
as
a
prerequisite
to
exercising
its
jurisdiction.
i
think
there
are
two
examples
that
help
to
illustrate
the
point.
the
first
is
the
city
of
erie
v.
pap's
a.m.
case,
in
which
this
court
decided
to
review
a
state
court
injunction
entered
in
favor
of
a
plaintiff
who
no
longer
had
what
we
would
think
of
as
an
article
iii
stake
in
the
case
by
the
time
the
case
reached
this
court.
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
left
the
nude
dancing
business
and
had
affirmatively
stated
they
had
no
intention
to
return.
the
court,
nevertheless,
reached
the
merits
of
the
state
court
decision
that
was
on
review
because
to
do
otherwise
would
be
to
saddle
the
city
of
erie
with
an
ongoing
injury.
in
the--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--there
was
indeed
a
dissent
in
that
case.
but
i
would
note
that
there
was
also--
[laughter]
--a
dissent
from
the
denial
of
cert
in
bunting
v.
mellen,
in
which
very
much
the
same
situation
was
presented.
the
cadets
who
brought
the
challenge
to
the
vmi
supper
prayer
that
was
at
issue
in
that
case
had
graduated
from
vmi
by
the
time
this
case
reached
this
court.
and
i
think,
as
you
quite
properly
noted
in
your
dissent
from
denial
of
review
in
that
case,
for
this
court
to
essentially
insulate
those
types
of
constitutional
rulings
from
review
would
be
to
undermine
the
very
purposes
for
which
this
court--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--the
reason
we
think
the
qualified
immunity
situation
is
different,
it
presents
a
set
of
exceptional
circumstances
that
weren't
an
exception
to
the
usual
prudential
rule,
is
because
the
qualified
immunity
situation
is
one
in
which
this
court
has
encouraged
courts
to
undertake
these
kinds
of
constitutional
rulings
for
the
purpose
of
changing
the
legal
landscape
going
forward,
for
the
very
purpose
of
establishing
the
law
so
that
the
--
that
qualified
immunity
doesn't
remain
perpetually
available
to
officials
even
though
they
are
engaging
in
conduct--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--that
has
been
found
unconstitutional.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that
in
this
situation
what
we
have
is
not
just
a
preview
of
how
the
court
of
appeals
would
decide
the
case
subsequently
in
a
case
in
which
it
was
actually
necessary
to
reach
a
certain
judgment.
what
we
have
is
a
decision
that
changes
the
legal
landscape
going
forward.
it
establishes
the
law
such
that
qualified
immunity
will
not
be
available
in
the
next
case.
and
it
means
that
people
like
petitioner
camreta
and
other
child
protective
services
workers
who
are
doing
their
best
to
protect
children
from
abuse
are
now
on
notice
that
if
they
attempt
to
detain
temporarily
a
child
in
school
for
the
purposes
of
trying
to
confirm
or
dispel
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
child
abuse
without
a
warrant
supported
by
probable
cause,
that
they
will
invite
lawsuits
that
would
put
them
on
the
line
for
personal
monetary
damages.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
true.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
true,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
that
if
that's
the
disposition
that
this
court
thinks
is
appropriate,
we
would
be
certainly
be
happier
with
that
than
a
rule
that
says--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--an
incorrect
constitutional
ruling.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
would
note
that
a
vacatur
rule
would
come
with
certain
costs
that
i
think
this
court
should
keep
in
mind
as
it
decides
what
the
appropriate
disposition
of
this
case
is.
the
reason
that
respondent
has
so
vigorously
objected
to
that
disposition
is
because
it
is
inconsistent
in
some
ways
with
the
very
reason
for
permitting
courts
of
appeals
to
undertake
this
kind
of
constitutional
determination
in
the
first
place.
it
undermines
the
--
the
development
of
the
constitutional
law
if
this
court
simply
wipes
the
--
the
slate
clean
but
doesn't
exercise
its
own
authority
to
clarify
the
law
by
correcting
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
done.
and
i
think,
as
the
chief
justice
has
quite
correctly
pointed
out,
it
also
does
nothing
to
dispel
the
cloud
of
uncertainty
that
hangs
over
individuals
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
ninth
circuit.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
for
that
reason
we
would
not
object
to
that
disposition
in
this
case.
we
would
just
observe
that
that
disposition
is
one
that
does
not
sit
particularly
comfortably
with
the
reasoning
of
pearson
and
the
line
of
cases
that
comes
before
it,
that
recognizes
that
the
reason
why
we
encourage
courts
of
appeals
to
undertake
these
determinations
in
the
first
place
is
to
promote
the
development
of
constitutional
law
and
to
ensure
that
the
law
doesn't
remain
not
clearly
established
in
perpetuity.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
right.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
it's
--
it's
true
that
if
this
court
were
to
vacate
the
ninth
circuit's
constitutional
ruling,
mr.
camreta
and
others
who
are
similarly
situated
wouldn't
face
the
very
significant
concrete
prospective
effect
of
this
decision,
which
is
to
strip
them
of
qualified
immunity
in
future
cases.
they
would
be
able
to
argue,
as
you're
suggesting,
that
the
law
is
not
clearly
established.
at
the
same
time--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--certainly,
justice
ginsburg.
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
held
that
the
temporary
detention
of
a
child
in
school
to
confirm
or
dispel
suspicions
that
that
child
is
being
abused
is
unconstitutional
unless
the
questioning
officials
have
a
warrant,
probable
cause,
or
parental
consent.
we
think
each
of
those
requirements
is
unjustified
as
a
matter
of
fourth
amendment
law
and
imposes
a
serious
burden
on
the
conduct
of
the
--
of
the
government
at
the
initial
stages
of
a
child
abuse
investigation.
as--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--that's
correct,
justice
sotomayor.
the
question
is
reasonableness.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
would
go
to
the
--
the
question
of
the
manner
in
which
the
--
the
interview
is
conducted,
as
opposed
to
whether
it's--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--reasonable
at
its
inception.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
the
question
that
the
ninth
circuit
answered
in
this
case
was
a
question
that
concerns
the
justification
for
the
interview
at
its
inception.
the
ninth
circuit
said
a
warrant,
probable
cause,
or
parental
consent
is
required
from
the
very
outset.
that
would
be
true
whether
an
interview
lasted
2
hours
or
10
minutes,
whether
the
child
was
responsive,
whether
the
child
wasn't.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
--
i
would
disagree
with
that
proposition.
i
think
law
enforcement
very
much
needs
help
on
the
questions
the
ninth
circuit
actually
decided
because
the
warrant
or
probable
cause
requirement
is
one
that
has
a
very
significant
effect
on
the
way
that
they
carry
out
their
very
important
business
in
this
area.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
