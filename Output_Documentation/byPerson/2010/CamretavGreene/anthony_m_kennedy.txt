anthony
m.

of
course,
there
are
two
issues
here,
and
i
hope
we
do
get
to
the
substance.
can
you
tell
me
camreta's
current
occupation?
does
the
record
establish
that?
does
the
record
tell
us
what
camreta
is
doing
now?
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
monell
claim,
and
it's
--
and
the
district
court
has
held
its
ruling,
i
take
it,
in
abeyance
pending
--
a
ruling
for
reinstatement
of
that
claim,
pending
our
decision
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
--
we're
getting
to
the
merits.
do
you
agree
that
search
--
strike
that
--
that
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
relevant
category
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
agree
that
the
child
was
--
was
seized?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
happens
if
the
teacher
tells
--
the
student
is
misbehaving
on
the
playground:
go
back
in
the
classroom.
you
can't
--
you
sit
there
by
yourself.
you
can't
be
part
of
recess.
is
that
a
seizure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
made
this
a
seizure?
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
a
teacher?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i'm
--
i'm
asking
for
your
view
of
the
proper
category
to
apply
in
these
cases,
and
if
it
is
a
seizure,
then
--
then
it's
just
a
question
of
reasonableness,
and
we'd
look
at
all
the
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
it
would
affect
camreta's
behavior
and
that
of
other
child
protective
officers.
the
lawyer
would
explain:
now,
legally
this
is
not
binding;
it
just
never
happened.
but
three
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
reasoned
decision
have
explained
why
this
is
contrary
to
the
constitution,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
any
conscientious
law
enforcement
officer
would
--
would
take
that
seriously
into
account.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
justice
alito's
question
was
addressed
to
the
ninth
circuit.
in
the
ninth
circuit,
it's
not
going
to
come
up
again
if
we
assume
that
our
public
employees
are
going
to
be
law-abiding.
they're
bound
by
this
in
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
--
and
you
want
them
to
be
bound,
and
yet
you
say
there's
--
that
the
case
is
moot.
i
just
don't
understand
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
you're
withdrawing
your
monell
action
against
the
municipality,
is
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
it
--
isn't
a
motion
to
reinstate
it
still
pending
in
the
district
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so
it's
still
alive.
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
you
won't
ask
that
it
be
reinstated.
