justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
camreta
would
be
protected.
he
would
presumably
still
be
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
because
a
vacated
alternative
holding
certainly
could
not
really
establish
something,
i
would
assume.
but
municipalities,
if
they
continue
to
participate
in
--
in
questioning
of
this
nature,
would
not
be
protected;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
want
to
have
the
fourth
amendment
decision
preserved
and
have
it
govern
an
enormous
chunk
of
the
country
so
that
all
the
states
in
the
ninth
circuit
have
to
comply
with
it,
and
anybody
--
any
individual
officer
who
doesn't
comply
with
it
would
do
so
on
pain
of
personal
liability,
but
you
don't
want
that
ground-breaking
decision
to
be
subject
to
review
by
this
court
on
the
merits.
is
that
a
summary
of
what
you
want?
does
that
make
any
sense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
there
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
which
--
which
generally
requires
a
warrant,
to
suggest
that
the
length
of
the
interrogation
was
relevant
to
their
decision?
i
mean,
at
least
the
child
protective
services
need
to
decide
whether
they
need
a
warrant
before
they
begin
the
questioning,
no
matter
how
long
it's
going
to
last.
where
does
it
say
that
the
length
is
relevant
to
the
--
to
the
issue
that
they
decided?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
on
the
issue--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
on
the
issue
of
consent,
do
you
read
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
as
having
an
age
limit?
suppose
that
the
child
is,
let's
say,
16
years
old.
is
the
child
at
16
incapable
of
consenting
to
questioning?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
suppose
it
was
just
mr.
camreta
or
suppose
it
was
the
school
nurse,
would
the
answer
be
the
same?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
it
was
just
mr.
camreta
and
he--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
he
taped
the
conversation
and
then
later
turned
it
over
to
the
--
to
the
police
if
he
discovered
evidence
of
child
abuse,
there
would
be
no
problem?
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
could
you
have
cross-petitioned
in
an
effort
to
get
damages,
so
if
you
had
wanted
to
preserve
the
issue,
you
surely
could
have
done
that,
couldn't
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you
were
designing
what
you
would
regard
as
an
ideal
system,
and
you're
very
knowledgeable
in
this
--
in
this
area,
and
you
concluded
that
some
kind
of
approval
by
a
detached
individual
should
be
required
before
something
like
this
is
allowed,
would
you
set
the
standard
at
probable
cause?
would
you
say
that
the
child
protective
service
has
to
have
probable
cause
that
there's
abuse
before
they
can
question
the
child
to
find
whether
or
not
there
was
abuse,
or
would
you
set
it
at
some
lower
level?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
ms.
kubitschek
said
it
was
based
on
different
events.
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
fourth
amendment
claim
against
the
county
is
based
on
--
on
this
interview?
