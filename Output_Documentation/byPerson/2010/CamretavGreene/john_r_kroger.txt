mr.
john
r.
kroger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
pearson
v.
callahan,
this
court
gave
the
lower
federal
courts
discretionary
power
to
decide
substantive
questions
of
constitutional
law
in
qualified
immunity
cases
in
order
to
further
the
development
of
constitutional
precedent.
if
it
is
valuable
for
the
lower
courts
to
decide
these
cases,
then
it
is
essential
that
this
court
be
able
to
review
those
decisions
in
order
to
ensure
that
they
are
accurate.
for
this
reason,
the
case
is
justiciable
and
should
be
reviewed
on
the
merits.
turning
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--the
record
does
not,
your
honor,
because
the
mootness
issue
was
raised
relatively
late
in
the
proceedings,
but
i'm
aware
of
what
his
current
occupation
is.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
he
is
a
child
protective
services
worker
with
the
oregon
department
of
human
services.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
your
honor,
the
interest
of
mr.
camreta
is
the
ongoing
harm
he
has
in
his
job.
under
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
he
is
forced
to
either
forgo
a
regular
and
recurring
duty
of
his
job,
which
is
to
interview
potential
child
victims
in
school,
or
to
face
liability
for
doing
so.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
your
honor,
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
does
apply
to
mr.
camreta.
the
court
specifically
advised
mr.
camreta
and
others
in
his
position
that
they
are
on
notice
that
in-school
interviews
of
students
that
require
a
seizure
require
a
warrant,
and,
thus,
the
ninth
circuit
decision
does
have
precedential
effect
and
impacts
mr.
camreta.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
your
honor,
i
disagree
that
s.g.
has
no
ongoing
concrete
stake
in
the
outcome
of
this
case.
in
footnote
20
of
the
respondent's
brief
on
page
33,
the
respondent
notes
that
they
have
filed
a
motion
in
the
united
states
district
court
to
bring
their
fourth
amendment
claim
against
deschutes
county,
a
potential
party
that
has
no
qualified
immunity
as
a
defense.
and,
obviously,
the
legal
viability
of
that
--
that
claim
against
deschutes
county
will
depend
very
much
on
the
ruling
on
the
merits
of
this
court.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
district
court
ruled
that
it
was
premature
until
these
proceedings
were
concluded.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
your
honor,
the
controversy
remains
the
fourth
amendment
claim,
which
is
the
respondent
is
seeking
to
pursue
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
that
gives
the
respondent
here
a
direct
financial
stake
in
the
viability
of
their
fourth
amendment
argument,
and--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--your
honor,
in
arizonans
v.
arizona,
the
court
recognized
that
the
employee
in
that
case
had
an
interest
in
how
she
was
able
to
conduct
her
job.
the
court
decided
that
the
case
was
--
was
moot
because
she
had
resigned
from
her
position
with
the
state.
but
there
was
no
objection
to
--
to
her
standing
because
she
was
a
public
employee
that
wanted
to
perform
her
job
in
a
particular
way
because
she
was
required
to
under
state
law,
and
here--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
your
honor,
the
--
the
--
mr.
camreta
remains
a
party
below,
and
it's
possible
that
the
court's
rulings
on
the
fourth
amendment
merits
may
impact
the
fourteenth
amendment
claims
that
are
being
made
against
mr.
camreta
that
are
alive
and
in
controversy
below.
moreover,
this
case,
even
if
one
strips
out
the
ongoing
motion
that's
been
made
in
the
district
court,
resembles
in
all
material
respects
erie
v.
pap's
a.m.,
where
the
court
found
that
there
was
standing
to
bring
the
case
and
it
was
not
moot.
and
so,
there
does
seem
to
be
an
active
case
or
controversy
that
is
equivalent
to
that
that
was
present
in
erie
v.
pap's
a.m.--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
it
is
a
claim
of
mrs.
greene
to
interference
with
familial
rights
as
a
result
of
certain
actions
by
mr.
camreta
and
other
defendants.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
so
the--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--your
honor,
i
believe
if
the
court
determined
that
this
case
was
moot,
the
--
the
appropriate
remedy
would
be
pursuant
to
munson
where
--
to
vacate
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
what
--
what
i
think
the
appropriate
remedy
for
the
court
would
be
would
be
to
effectively--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--vacate
the
opinion
or
decision
on
the
fourth
amendment
claim.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
the
--
i
think
the
only
difficulty
with
that
as
a
--
as
a
outcome
of
the
case
is
it
undercuts
the
logic
of
the
pearson
decision.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
you're
correct,
your
honor.
it
would
place
mr.
camreta
and
other
child
protective
services
workers
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
very--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
they
do
they
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
your
honor,
that
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i
would
happy
--
be
happy
to
respond.
the
state
of
oregon
provided
legal
advice
advising
child
protective
services
workers
to
attempt
to
avoid
anything
that
would
be
a
seizure
in
a
school
and,
in
cases
where
there
would
pose
no
risk
of
danger
to
the
children,
to
seek
consent
of
--
of
a
parent
before
conducting
an
interview.
nevertheless,
that
legal
advice
puts
a
significant
burden
on
the
child
protective
services
workers
to
--
to
do
their
utmost
to
protect
oregon's
children.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
your
honor,
i
think
in
--
in
those
cases,
because
parental
consent
is
a
viable
alternative
where
the
allegation
is
a
child
is
being
abused
by
another
child--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
--
the
child
abuse
context
is
somewhat
unique
in
that
there
are
very
few
ways
to
investigate
properly
child
abuse
without
speaking
to
the
only
witness
that's
typically
available
in
the
case,
and
that
is
the
child.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
your
honor,
it
would
be
the
same
reasonableness
standard
that
would
apply,
but
i
think
the
courts
might
reach
different
conclusions
about
what
would
be
reasonable
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
yes,
your
honor,
we
concede
that
the
child
was
seized.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
no,
your
honor,
i
--
i
disagree
that
that
would
be
a
seizure,
because--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--your
honor,
the
reason
we
conceded
the
issue
of
seizure
is
we
are
here
on
--
on
summary
judgment,
and
we
took
the
facts
as
alleged,
which
involved
transporting
the
student
inside
the
school.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--no,
your
honor,
but
they
would
have
to
talk
to
children
in
a
way
which
runs
no
risk
of
being
found
of
seizing
the
children
within
the
meaning
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
i--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--yes,
your
honor,
and
you
can
see
the
problem
which
the
ninth
circuit
decision
causes
practically
on
the
child
welfare
system
in
the
state
of
oregon.
the
--
mr.
camreta
and
other
child
protective
services
workers
under
the
ninth
circuit
decision
face
an
enormous
burden.
in
most
of
these
cases
it
is
impossible
to
establish
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant
without
first
speaking
to
the
child
because
the
child
is
usually
the
only
witness
that
is
available
to
the
government;
and
so
to
require,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
here,
that
we
obtain
a
warrant
prior
to
even
speaking
to
a
child
victim
places--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--no,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
reasonable
suspicion
is
the
--
is
the
proper
basis
before
making
a
seizure
of
a
child
to
conduct
one
of
these
inquiries.
significant
here
in
griffin
and
subsequent
cases
like
lidster,
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
person
being
searched
or
seized
is
significant
to
the
reasonableness
analysis,
and
here
it
is
not
an
adversarial
relationship.
the
child
and
the
state
share
a
significant
interest
in
making
sure
that
that
child
is
safe;
and
were
the
government
to
continue
to
be
put
in
a
position
of
not
being
able
to
speak
to
a
child
until
probable
cause
has
developed
in
some
other
way,
children
will
continue
to
be
placed
at
risk.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
would
be
a
--
a
significant
step
forward
for
mr.
camreta
and
others
similarly
placed.
the
--
the
challenge
is
that
those
kind
of
claims
then
would
be
perpetually
subject
to
--
to
qualified
immunity
because
the
law
would
not
be
clarified.
and
that--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
yes,
your
honor.
that's
part
of
the
reason
we
agreed
that
a
seizure
was
committed
here,
so
that
law
enforcement
are
not
placed
in
a
difficult
position
every
time
they
speak
to
a
child,
of
trying
to
make
their
own
determination
as
to
whether--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--no,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
the
government
officials
will
have
to
conduct
that
--
that
seizure
in
a
reasonable
manner
for
a
reasonable
duration.
that's
different,
i
think,
though,
your
honor,
than
the
threshold
question
of
if
they
start
to
talk
to
a
child,
of
trying
to
judge
in
the
middle
of
an
interview,
have
we
gone
too
far,
has
a
seizure
occurred.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
is
whether
vacating
the
decision
will
have
an
impact
on
the
litigation
below,
and
it
will.
the
respondent
is
seeking
to
preserve
the
ninth
circuit
decision
precisely
to
aid
the
fourth
amendment
claim
that
the
respondent
is
making
against
deschutes
county,
and
thus,
this
is
somewhat
analogous
to
the
situation
in
the
pacific
bell
case,
where
you
have
a
petitioner
and
respondent
seeking
different
remedies
from
this
court
in
light
of
the
impact
that
it
will
have
on
subsequent
litigation.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
the
due
process--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--your
honor,
i
have
not
seen
the
new
complaint,
but
my
understanding
is
that
it
is
the
same
event
and
same
claim.
