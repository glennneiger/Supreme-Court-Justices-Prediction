justice
elena
kagan
general
kroger,
i
don't
think
that
the
question
here
is
really
a
standing
question;
it's
really
whether
there
is
a
controversy
between
this
particular
plaintiff
and
this
particular
defendant
such
that
a
judgment
in
this
case
would
actually
affect
the
legal
relationship
between
the
two,
between
the
particular
plaintiff
and
the
particular
defendant.
so
how
would
it
do
that?
how
would
a
legal
judgment
in
this
case
affect
the
legal
relationship
between
this
plaintiff
and
this
defendant?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
kruger,
how
does
this
--
this
situation,
the
qualified
immunity
situation,
differ
from
a
wide
variety
of
other
situations
in
which
we
might
not
be
able
to
get
to
the
underlying
constitutional
ruling?
for
example,
in
any
case
where
there's
a
constitutional
ruling
but
also
a
harmless
error
ruling,
or
in
a
sixth
amendment
case
where
there
are
standards
about
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
but
then
a
finding
that
there's
no
prejudice.
in
all
of
those
kinds
of
cases,
the
underlying
substantive
ruling
might
be
insulated
from
our
review.
how
would
you
say
that
the
qualified
immunity
situation
is
different
and
how
would
you
be
able
to
cabin
this
rule?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
presumably,
in
every
case--
justice
elena
kagan
--excuse
me.
presumably,
in
every
case
in
which
a
court
does
these
paired
rulings,
if
you
will
--
it
doesn't
just
say
that
the
error
was
harmless,
but
says
that
there
was
an
error
--
there's
a
purpose
to
clarify
the
law.
how
is
this
different,
once
again?
justice
elena
kagan
but
then
we
wouldn't
have
a
case.
justice
elena
kagan
is
that
against
a
different
party,
ms.
kubitschek?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
general,
i
take
it
that
that
problem
disappears
--
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
if
we
find
there's
no
jurisdiction.
if
we
munsingwear
this
case,
the
decision
is
wiped
off
the
case,
you
return
to
status
quo
ante,
and
you
tell
all
your
people
that
they
can
do
what
they
would
have
done
beforehand;
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
this
case
arises
from
a
child
abuse
investigation
conducted
in
oregon
nearly
a
decade
ago
by
a
state
child
protective
services
caseworker
and
a
county
deputy
sheriff.
petitioner's
here
are
bob
camreta,
the
case
worker
and
james
alford,
the
sheriff.
they
interviewed
respondent
sg
who
was
then
nine
years
old
at
her
elementary
school
about
allegations
that
her
father
had
sexually
abused
her.
her
father
was
indicted
on
that
offense,
but
the
jury
didn't
reach
a
verdict
and
the
charges
were
dismissed.
sg
then
sued
the
officials
for
money
damages
on
the
ground
that
the
in-school
interview
violated
the
fourth
amendment's
bar
on
unreasonable
seizures.
the
district
court
reentered
some
re-judgments
to
the
officials
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
the
court
of
appeals
first
wrote
that
the
interview
did
violate
the
fourth
amendment
because
camreta
and
alford
lack
a
warrant.
but
the
court
then
held
that
the
officials
were
entitled
to
qualify
immunity,
because
the
law
requiring
a
warrant
was
not
clearly
established
at
the
time
they
conducted
the
interview.
so
under
the
court's
decision,
the
officials
did
not
have
to
pay
sg
any
money
damages.camreta
and
alford,
nonetheless,
asked
us
to
review
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
that
their
conduct
violated
the
constitution.
our
opinion
first
considers
whether
we
may
review
a
lower
court's
constitutional
ruling,
here
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated
at
the
request
of
government
officials,
who
won
final
judgment
on
immunity
grounds.
the
answer
is
yes.
we
generally
may
review
petitions
in
this
posture.
article
iii
of
the
constitution
limits
our
jurisdiction
to
cases
in
controversies.
an
appeal
brought
by
immunized
officials
usually
qualifies
because
the
constitutional
ruling
that
the
official's
challenge
has
prospective
effect
on
the
parties.
the
court
issuing
the
ruling
has
said,
â€œalthough
this
official
is
immune
from
damages
today,
what
he
did
violates
the
constitution
and
that
he
or
anyone
else
does
that
thing
again,
that
person
will
be
liable
for
damages."
now,
if
the
official
regularly
engages
in
that
conduct
as
part
of
his
job,
he
suffers
an
injury
based
on
that
constitutional
ruling.
so
long
as
it
continues
and
effect,
he
must
either
change
the
way
he
performs
his
duties
or
risk
a
damages
action
against
him.
and
conversely,
if
the
person
who
initially
brought
suit
to
challenge
the
practice
may
again
be
subject
to
that
practice,
then
she
also
has
a
state
in
preserving
the
court's
holding,
and
so
there
is
a
case
for
controversy.
but
article
iii
recites,
this
court
as
a
matter
of
practice
generally
declines
to
consider
cases
at
the
request
of
a
prevailing
party.
we
have
frequently
said
that
we
review
judgments,
not
statements
and
opinions,
but
important
policy
considerations
support
making
an
exemption
here.
constitutional
determinations
in
qualified
immunity
cases
are
special
because
--
because
they
are
not
mere
dicta.
they
are
rulings
purposefully
designed
to
have
future
effect
on
the
conduct
of
public
officials
in
order
to
promote
compliance
with
constitutional
standards.
we
have
permitted
courts
to
make
these
rulings
even
though
they
are
not
necessary
to
a
judgment
when
an
official
has
qualified
immunity.
but
when
courts
availed
themselves
of
disability
and
make
these
constitutional
rulings,
it
is
also
proper
that
this
court
should
be
able
to
review
them.
still,
there
is
a
different
threshold
problem
with
revealing
the
ninth
circuit's
fourth
amendment
ruling
in
this
case.
this
case
is
moot.
as
i
said
earlier,
in
a
dispute
of
this
kind,
both
the
defendant
and
the
plaintiff
usually
retained
a
state
in
the
outcome.
that
is
true
about
camreta.
he
remains
employed
as
a
caseworker
and
so,
has
an
interest
in
challenging
the
ruling
that
requires
him
to
get
a
warrant
before
interviewing
a
child
at
her
school.
but
sg,
the
child,
does
not
have
any
presence
state
in
this
--
in
this
case,
because
she
no
longer
has
need
of
protection
from
the
challenge
practice.
she
has
moved
to
florida
and
she
is
in
fact
not
a
child
anymore.
she
is
only
months
away
from
her
18th
birthday
and
her
high
school
graduation.
so,
there
is
no
chance
that
she'll
be
subject
to
an
in-school
interview
in
oregon
or
anywhere
else
in
the
ninth
circuit
again
and
so,
we
have
no
life
controversy
to
review.
when
a
case
like
this
becomes
moot,
our
usual
practice
is
to
vacate
the
judgment
below.
our
reason
for
doing
so
is
that
the
petitioner
through
no
fault
of
its
own
has
been
prevented
from
obtaining
the
appellant
review
that
he's
entitled
to.
and
so,
we
want
to
prevent
the
lower
court's
unreviewable
decision
from
having
any
legal
consequence.
here,
as
i
just
explained,
the
happenstance
of
sg's
moving
across
country
and
becoming
an
adult
has
deprived
camreta
of
his
appeal
rights,
because
mootness
has
frustrated
his
ability
to
challenge
the
court
of
appeals,
fourth
amendment
ruling,
we
vacate
the
part
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
that
addressed
that
issue.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurrent
opinion.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
breyer
joins.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
