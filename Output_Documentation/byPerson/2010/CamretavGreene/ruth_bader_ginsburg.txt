justice

why
would
he
face
liability?
because
he
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
challenge
that
decision,
the
fourth
amendment
decision;
therefore,
it
would
have
no
preclusive
effect
on
him.
a
party
who
doesn't
have
the
--
if
there
are
alternative
holdings
and
you
lose
on
one,
win
on
the
other,
you're
not
precluded
by
the
loss
because
you
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
raise
it
on
appeal.
so
why
would
camreta
be
precluded?
why
would
he
face
punitive
damages
as
you're
suggesting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
isn't
the
answer,
then,
that
that's
the
right
case
to
take
up?
because
in
this
case,
we
have
a
plaintiff
who
is
not
going
to
be
confronted
with
this
situation
again
and
who
has
put
herself
out
of
the
running
for
damages
because
she
didn't
--
she
didn't
challenge
the
qualified
immunity
ruling.
so
she
has
no
stake
in
any
monetary
relief
from
this
claim.
she
has
no
continuing
--
the
--
what
has
happened
to
her,
happened
to
her
at
age
9,
will
never
happen
again
now
that
she's
past
18.
so
she
hasn't
--
if
she
came
to
court
today
with
her
case
as
an
18-year-old,
she
would
have
no
case
or
controversy.
it
just
seems
like
the
whole
case
has
evaporated.
she
has
no
claim.
she
did
have
a
claim
for
--
for
money
damages,
but
she
has
relinquished
that.
so,
what
--
what
genuine
controversy
is
before
us?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she
was
the
plaintiff.
in
arizona,
we
were
talking
about
whether
a
plaintiff
still
had
a
viable
claim,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
didn't
have
to
do
with
the
school
search
--
the
school
seizure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
--
and
this
case
presents
the
question
about
was
this
unreasonable?
that
--
what's
left
in
the
case
has
to
do
with
the
mother's
claim,
and
it
has
to
do
with
putting
the
girls
in
custody,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happened
in
--
what
--
what
has
oregon
done
in
response
to
this
ninth
circuit
decision?
before
it
said
that
the
caseworkers
could
have
this
kind
of
interview
with
the
--
the
child
where
there
was
a
suspicion
of
abuse.
was
there
any
change
in
practice
in
oregon
in
response
to
the
ninth
circuit's
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
--
did
she
--
did
she
--
let's
go
back
one
step.
does
she
have
any
viable
claim
now?
this
is
not
capable
of
repetition,
evasive
of
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
very
limited
time.
could
you
--
could
you
go
to
the
merits
of
the
fourth
amendment
question
and
give
us
the
government's
position
on
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she's
asserting
the
interests
of
other
children
who
would
be
in
the
situation
that
she
was
once
in,
but
no
longer;
but
we
have
said
the
plaintiff
herself
must
have
a
live
controversy,
and
there
was
no
class
action
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
are
you
reading
in
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals?
because
i
was
under
the
impression
that
they
did
say
there's
only
three
ways:
one
is
you
get
a
warrant;
another
is
you
get
parental
consent;
and
a
third
is
exigent
circumstances.
i
thought
that
was
the
--
the
ruling
of
law
by
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
see
where
they
--
i
thought
that,
yes,
the
case
is
about
a
single
plaintiff;
it's
not
a
class
action.
but
they're
making
a
rule
of
law.
what
does
the
fourth
amendment
require?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
got
a
stipulation
that
there
was
a
seizure,
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
was
never
any
argument
that
was
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
given
that
there
was
seizure--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
question
is:
is
it
reasonable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
you,
in
the
--
many
of
the
questions
have
gone
to
leads,
but
this
is
initially
a
social
worker's
investigation.
and
you
said,
when
stating
what
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
was,
that
police
are
in
combination
with
the
caseworker.
suppose
we
took
out
--
out
of
the
picture.
he
didn't
utter
a
word
in
the
interview.
suppose
we
take
the
sheriff,
deputy
sheriff,
out.
the
only
one
who
comes
to
the
school
and
asks
to
talk
to
this
child
is
the
caseworker
from
the
department
of
health?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
information
elicited
from
the
child
is
that
she
has
been
abused
by
her
father,
then
there
is
a
likelihood
that
there
will
be
police
interest
in
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wouldn't
affect
your
client
in
any
way,
because
she's
out
of
it
and
you
were
candid
from
the
beginning
to
say
as
far
as
she's
concerned
this
is
a
moot
case;
but
as
far
as
camreta
and
the
other
officers
are
concerned,
we
were
told
by
oregon's
representative
that
they
are
not
--
that
they
have
tailored
their
behavior
to
conform
to
this
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
