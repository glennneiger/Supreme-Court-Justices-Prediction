chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-114,
fox
v.
vice.
mr.
rosenkranz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
an
incredible
burden
to
impose
on
the
district
court.
it's
hard
enough
for
clients
to
read
through
these
billing
records
and
figure
out
what's
valid
and
what's
not,
but
to
ask
the
district
court
to
then
go
through
and
look
at
it,
and
see
--
and
maybe
it
doesn't
say,
you
know,
1983
suit>
["],
"state
suit".
maybe
it's
just
an
entry.
and
then
you've
got
to
go
through
entry
by
entry
and
say
well,
now,
was
that
for
the
1983
action
or
was
that
for
the
state
court
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
seems
--
just
--
sorry,
i
don't
mean
to
drone
on,
but
that
seems
to
me
to
be
an
especially
odd
burden
to
impose
when
you're
dealing
with
an
area
where
there
is
a
heavy
dose
of
discretion
to
the
district
court
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe
in
your
case,
but
there's
no
reason
to
suppose
there
won't
be
cases
where
the
things
are
flipped,
and
the
federal
claim,
perhaps
frivolous
for
a
legal
reason
rather
than
a
factual
one,
is
the
dominant
driving
force
in
the
litigation
and
you've
tagged
on
a
few
other
state
claims.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
a
pretty
audacious
claim,
that
you
filed
such
a
frivolous
cause
of
action
that
they
shouldn't
have
wasted
so
much
time
responding
to
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
lot
of
chutzpah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
shouldn't
have
filed
it.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
clarify
what
you
mean
by
"completely
intertwined"?
you
mean
there
is
no
incremental
work
just
on
the
federal
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
--
you're
looking
for
fees
--
your
first
argument
--
even
though
they
can
identify
fees
that
were
incurred
solely
on
defending
the
frivolous
cause
of
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
that's
an
easier
case.
what
if
it's
20
percent
spent
on
the
federal
action?
do
you
still
completely
intertwine?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
it's
not
completely
frivolous,
but
frivolous
enough
to
satisfy
a
demand
for
fees?
what
if
it
does
take
them,
you
know,
40
hours
to
prepare
the
motion
to
dismiss
it
as
frivolous?
do
they
get
those
40
hours?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you've
got
to
find
the
17
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you've
got
to
look
carefully
at
the
facts.
they
assume
good
faith
on
the
part
of
their
adversary
that
would
not
file
a
frivolous
claim.
the
idea
that
it's
going
to
be
able
to
--
they're
going
to
look
at
it
and
say,
this
is
frivolous,
file
a
motion
in
federal
court,
i
think
that's
a
--
doesn't
reflect
an
adequate
--
doesn't
reflect
a
realistic
understanding
of
federal
litigation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
that's
not
how
it
works.
you
say
they
know
they're
going
to
be
seeking
claims.
they
don't
know
in
advance,
this
is
going
to
be
a
frivolous
claim,
the
discovery
is
going
to
be
completely
overlapping
or
it's
not
going
to
be
overlapping.
and
most
lawyers
do
not
keep
detailed
accurate
billing
records.
that's
just
an
underlying
reality.
so
i
do
think
it's
a
significant
burden
on
the
district
court
to
say,
go
back
and
read
these
--
read
these
billing
sheets,
figure
out
which
is
which,
presumably
have
litigation
over
it.
someone
is
going
to
file
a
motion
for
these
fees;
the
other
person
is
going
to
say,
no,
no,
it
shouldn't
be
20,000,
it
should
be
15,000.
and
our
precedent
in
this
area
gives
a
huge
amount
of
discretion
to
the
district
courts,
just
reasonableness.
and
it
seems
to
me
you're
buying
into
a
lot
of
litigation
to
decide
whether
it's
20,000
or
15,000.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
you
go
back
to
the
first
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
rosenkranz,
i'm
looking
at
the
billing
sheet,
august
14,
2007,
32
hours,
miscellaneous
cost,
online
research.
is
that
for
federal
or
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stancil.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
liability
under
the
state
law
claims
is
$100,000
and
the
liability
under
the
federal
claims
is
the
same,
and
you
win
on
the
federal
claim
and
you
lose
on
the
state
law
claim,
if
i
were
the
client,
i
would
say
your
degree
of
success
was
zero.
i
still
have
to
pay
$100,000.
the
fact
that
you
won
on
one
claim
but
then
lost
the
whole
issue
--
the
whole
value
on
another,
i
wouldn't
call
that
a
degree
of
success.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
assume
you
agree
that
discretion
can
end
up
going
either
way?
you
could
submit
time
sheets
that
show
35
percent
of
our
time
was
spent
on
the
federal
case,
and
the
district
judge
can
say,
you
know,
time
sheets
are
subject
to
--
manipulation
is
too
strong
a
word,
but
i'm
just
not
going
to
give
you
35
percent;
i'm
going
to
give
you
10
percent.
that's
a
reasonable
exercise
of
discretion.
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
say
a
whole
lot
about
it
and
it's
certainly
going
to
be
upheld
on
--
on
appeal,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
disagree
with
the
statement
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
about,
only
for
fees
that
can
be
distinctly
traced?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understood
your
adversary
to
agree
with
that
position.
you'll
need
to
switch
sides,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
argument
has
focused,
in
reference
to
the
complaint
and
all
that,
on
the
legal
theories.
your
friend
has
focused
on
the
underlying
factual
basis,
and
all
the
litigation
--
all
the
background
work
on
the
underlying
factual
basis,
i
don't
know
why
that
can
be
fairly
attributed
only
to
the
1983
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rosenkranz,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
wondering
kind
of
as
a
starting
point,
and
i
don't
know
why
you
would
fight
so
vigorously
against
the
verbal
formulation
"fairly
attributable".
i
assume
most
district
courts,
when
they
get
it,
they're
going
to
start
by
looking
at
whatever
his
affidavit,
this
is
how
much
our
fees
were,
and
then
if
there's
some
reason,
perhaps
mr.
stancil's
case,
where
everybody
thinks
it's
a
federal
that's
all,
or
maybe
not,
then
they
can
just
go
"fairly
attributable"
rather
than
but-for,
which
gives
the
district
court
a
lot
more
leeway
and
the
sort
of
leeway
we
have
always
held
in
this
area
they
should
have.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
