mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
fox
has
rock-solid
legal
claims
against
a
police
chief
based
upon
facts
that
were
strong
enough
to
send
that
police
chief
to
prison.
yet
he's
been
ordered
to
pay
all
of
the
attorney's
fees
for
an
entire
2-year
course
of
a
litigation
because
his
lawyers
decided
to
plead
and
then
drop
a
single
federal
theory.
that
award
is
wrong
and
it's
not
what
congress
intended.
congress
wanted
to
protect
defendants
from
the
lying
or
the
vexatious
plaintiff
who
shouldn't
be
in
court
at
all.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
the
court
took
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
legal
theory
was
frivolous,
but
that
the
underlying
cause
of
action,
which
is
to
say
the
operative
facts,
were
meritorious;
and
in
fact
they
are
meritorious.
they
are
going
to
trial
in
2
weeks.
and
so
this
is
a
wrongdoing
defendant
against
whom
was
pled
a
legal
theory
that
we
now
assume
was
frivolous.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
in
this
case
the
liability
was
far
greater
for
the
state
court
claims
than
for
the
1983
claims.
but
congress
was
concerned--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
that
was--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--that
was
one
incremental
increase.
but
the
liability
in
this
case
on
the
constitutional
claim
was
for,
and
the
reason
it
was
found
to
be
frivolous,
was
that
he
was
seeking
liability
on
a
constitutional
claim
for
being
deprived
of
his
right
to
run
for
office
when
in
fact
he
won
the
office.
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
the
reputational
harm
was
far
greater.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
the
answer
is
partial
responsibility,
yes,
your
honor.
but
let's
--
and
i
think
your
honor
is
correct
to
be
looking
at
the
burdens.
the
burdens
of
the
discovery
were
all
the
same.
it
was
the
same
nucleus
of
operative
facts.
now,
if
this
was
indeed
frivolous
from
inception,
the
defendants
could
easily
have
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
it
should
have
taken
no
time
at
all.
and
if
there
was
incremental
increase
in
discovery
with
respect
to
the
federal
claims,
then
the
defendants
have
only
themselves
to
blame
for
not
having
moved
to
dismiss
early
on.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
and
they're
simultaneous,
simultaneous,
your
honor?
i
--
that's
a
much
harder
question.
i
think
the
answer
would
be
yes,
they
would
be
entitled
at
least
to
those
incremental
increases
in
the
burden,
but
if
--
if
they're
doing
discovery
on
both
cases,
they
can't
say:
oh,
well
this
is
the
--
all
of
the
discovery
was
federal
discovery,
none
of
it
was
state
discovery,
when
they
were
on
the
same
facts.
it's
the
incremental
burden
when
you've
got
these,
these
intertwined--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--so,
your
honor,
we're
still
operating
on
the
hypothetical
that
they're
separate
cases--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--not
intertwined?
because
my
answer
might
be
different.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
my
answer
to
that
hypothetical
is
the
same
as
our
point
two,
that
if
there
is
--
if
there
are
fees
to
be
awarded
at
all,
they
have
to
be
fees
that
are
tethered
to
the
rationale
for
there
being
a
right
to
attorney's
fees
in
the
first
place,
which
is
what
was
the
incremental
burden
of
the
federal,
of
the
federal
lawsuit?
and
a
judge
would
say--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor,
it
would
be
very
easy
in
this
case.
what
you
do
is
you
look
for
entries
or
ask
the
defendant
to
come
forward
with
entries
that
say
this
was
specific
to
the
federal
lawsuit;
i
had
to
--
i
had
to
file
a
removal
notice,
i
had
to
litigate
over--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--so,
your
honor,
let
me
then
start
--
move
back
to
our
overarching
point,
which
is
that
these
are
the
sorts
of
incremental
burdens
that
are
trivial,
if
they
exist
at
all,
and
that
shouldn't
be
awarded
attorney's
fees
at
all.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
that's
a
key
point
in
our
presentation.
it
actually
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
flipped
or
not.
the
factual
foundations
are
the
same,
by
definition,
for
all
of
the
legal
theories,
so
the
factual--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--indeed,
your
honor,
and
so
let
me
answer
that
question
in
two
ways.
first
is,
if
the
defendants
see
a
complaint,
a
1983
theory,
that
is
flawed
at
the
inception,
they
have
no
business
incurring
costs
with
respect
to
color
of
state
law
or
policymaker
or
not.
they
should
move
to
dismiss
on
the
theory
that
is
presented
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
no,
your
honor.
my
point
is--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--you
honor,
that's
their
point.
they're
saying
it
was
frivolous
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
well,
if
it
was
frivolous
on
the
face
from
inception,
they
should
have
moved
to
dismiss
from
inception.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
i
understand
the
argument,
your
honor,
but
the
seventh
circuit
has
a
very
good
opinion
that's
cited
in
the
brief
that
explains
that
when
the
defendants
are
just
racking
up
fees
on
a
claim
that
they
claim
is
frivolous,
that
they
could
have
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on,
they
shouldn't
be
racking
up
fees
on
that
claim.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor.
let
me
begin
by--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--correcting
the
premise,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
the
sixth
circuit
is
an
outlier,
but
the
sixth
circuit
is
an
outlier
because
it
says
if
you
have
got
a
lawsuit
with
related
and
completely
unrelated
claims,
no
fees
at
all.
the
majority
rule,
the
clear
majority
rule,
is
the
rule
that
says
no
fees
at
all
when
you've
got
intertwined
claims.
that
is
the
sixth
--
which
also
has
that
other
piece
--
the
second,
the
ninth,
and
the
eleventh.
and
that
is
the
rule
--
that
is
the
primary
rule
that
we
are
advocating:
no
fees
if
they're
intertwined,
because
the
burdens
of
demonstrating
that
a
legal
theory
is
frivolous
are
minimal.
but
we
have
a
backup--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--and,
your
honor,
i
would
encourage
the
court
to
look
at
the
--
at
the
schwartz
treatise,
which
says
what
i've
just
articulated
is
the
clear
majority
rule,
not
just
among
the
circuits,
but
in
the
district
courts,
where
circuits
haven't
weighed
in.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor.
what
i
mean
by
"completely
intertwined"
is
that
they
arise
from
the
same
core
of
operative
facts.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
i'm
looking
to
block
fees
even
though
they
can,
and
the
reason
is
congress
was
concerned
about
burdensome
litigation,
not
about
minor,
trivial
increases
in
litigation
to
utter
three
sentences
about
a
legal
claim
and
then
say--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
the
premise
here
is
that
the
federal
action
is
completely
frivolous.
there
shouldn't
be
20
percent
spent
on
the
federal
action
if
they're
all
--
if
they're
all
intertwined,
if
it's
frivolous
on
its
face.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
i
guess
i'm
having
trouble
accepting
the
premise.
it
shouldn't
take
40
hours
to
tell
a
court,
here's
the
claim
and
here's
a
string
cite
of
17
cases
that
say
it's
wrong.
but
let
me
then
move
to
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--sure,
but
if
it
takes
40
hours
to
do
it,
then
it's
probably
not
frivolous.
but
let
me
move
into
the--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--i
understand,
your
honor.
let
me
just
make
one
other
point
about
our
first
rule,
and
then
move
to
the
second
rule.
the
point
that
was
made
earlier,
that
your
honor
made,
mr.
chief
justice,
earlier
about
the
burden
on
the
court
is
yet
another
reason
why
we
shouldn't
open
up
this
new
avenue
of
ancillary
fee
litigation.
when
it's
just
that
incremental
burden,
we
now
have
not
just
the
burden
of
a
frivolous
claim,
but
the
burden
of
courts
addressing
attorney's
fees
applications
and
the
--
on
the
frivolous
claim,
and
the
burden
of
the
courts
now
of
defendants
playing
the
games
of
withholding
motions
to
dismiss
that
should
have
been
brought
earlier--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--so
let
me
move
now
to
the
second
argument,
your
honor,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
if
there
are
going
to
be
fees
at
all,
the
fees
should
be
tied
to
the
basis
on
which
congress
is
allowing
defendants
to
get
fees,
and
that
is
defendants
are
suffering
extra
burdens;
we
want
to
protect
them
from
those
burdens.
if
that
is
the
rationale,
as
everyone
agrees,
then
the
only
fees
that
should
be
covered
are
fees
that
would
not
have
been
incurred
but
for
the
existence
of
the
federal
claim,
and
that
is,
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
actually
not
that
hard
to
demonstrate.
if
plaintiffs
keep
good,
accurate
records
and
they
know
that
they're
going
to
be
seeking
or
may
well
be
seeking
fees
on
the
federal
claim,
identify
the
few
documents
that
are
really--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--which
is
one
of
my
reasons
for
our
underlying--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--but,
your
honor,
let
me
--
let
me
just
explain
how
i
think
this
works.
first
of
all,
a
lawyer
who
is
--
who
has
a
federal
claim
against
him
is
duty-bound
to
start
keeping
track
of
the
federal
issues
early,
just
like
the
plaintiff
who
is
going
to
seek
fees
is
as
well.
but
it
isn't
that
hard,
because
the
vast
majority
--
in
an
intertwined
case
like
this,
the
vast
majority
of
expenditures
will
be
overlapping
expenditures.
all
of
the
discovery,
or
most
of
it,
will
be
overlapping.
and
the
lawyer
does
have
the
obligation,
then,
to
say
if
there
are
separate
things,
it's
the
burden
on
them
--
that
is,
the
defense
lawyer
--
to
point
out
those
incremental
burdens
that
would
not
have
been
incurred
but
for--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
hensley
says.
hensley
says
general
litigation
is
general
litigation,
and
you
don't
try
to
parse
it
out,
but
if
there
are
--
in
the
case
of
plaintiffs,
that
redounds
to
the
benefit
of
plaintiffs,
because
the
entire
case,
all
the
general
litigation,
could
have
contributed
to
the
ultimate
success.
when
it
comes
to
the
defendants,
though,
the
general
litigation
costs
could
easily
or
almost
certainly
were
incurred
in
connection
with
the
overall
defense,
and
so
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
say
to
them,
break
out
the
pieces,
the
documents
that
were
really
just
about
the
federal
lawsuit.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
minuscule,
your
honor,
and
let
me
refer
the
court
to
the
supplemental
appendix.
if
you
look,
for
example,
on
page
30,
that's
where
vice's
expenditures
begin.
it
goes
for
37
pages.
there
is
but
one
reference
to
federal
law.
it's
like
looking
for
waldo,
trying
to
find
the
theme
that
they
claim
was
dominating
this
case,
which
is
on
page
38,
one
reference.
and
so
i
would
say
it's
trivial.
and
particularly,
then,
if
we
layer
over
this
the
proposition
that
the
district
court--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--there
was,
and
there
was
--
and
that
was
done
mostly
by
the
city.
so
the
city
was
focused
on
--
there
was
motions
practice
about
some
of
the
legal
theories,
very
little
about
the
one
that
was
purported
to
be
frivolous.
there
was
quite
a
bit
about
color
of
state
law,
policymaker,
which,
as
i
said
earlier,
certainly
the
district
court
should
be
--
should
be
encouraged
to
ask
whether
those
should
have
been
incurred
or
whether
there
should
have
been
a
motion
first,
and
then
there
was
the
removal
petition,
and
then
there
were
the
arguments
about
whether
it
was
frivolous
on
the
basis
on
which
it
was
removed.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
all
right.
not
this
case,
of
course,
and
you
know
this
is
a
hypothetical.
the
answer
to
that
would
be,
i
can
imagine
a
district
court
being
allowed
to
carve
out
an
exception
where
they
can
say,
well,
we
hired
much
more
high-powered
lawyers
than
we
would
have
otherwise,
and
that
was
the
--
responsible
for
an
incremental
increase.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
that
is
a
correct
quote,
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
what
i
would
say,
your
honor,
is
not
that
they
misapplied
it.
they
uttered
one
sentence
that
was
correct.
and
then--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--then--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
correct.
so
--
so
they
uttered
those
sentences,
those
are
correct.
the
--
the
fifth
circuit
then
applied
a
series
of
standards
that
bear
no
relation
to
the
but-for
test.
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--agreed,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
it
was
a
factual
misapplication.
i'm
saying
every
sentence
after
that
is
a
direct
contradiction
of
the
but-for
test.
i
mean,
for
one
thing,
it
cannot
possibly
be
true
that
you
can
apply
a
but-for
test
when
no
one
has
ever
looked
at
the
underlying
records.
the
district
court
said
it
didn't
have
to.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
reason
the
district
court
was
correct
was
because
the
main
focus
of
the
parties,
what
they
had
in
their
heads,
was
the
federal
case.
under
a
but-for
test
it
doesn't
matter
what
they
had
in
their
heads.
it
matters
whether
the
work
is
wasted,
whether
it's
transferrable--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
i
--
i
understand
your
point.
we're
disagreeing
about
whether
this
is
simply
a
factual
misapplication,
which
i
believe
it
was
not,
or
a
statement
of
a
series
of
standards
that
when
district
courts
in
the
fifth
circuit
now
apply
those
standards
we'll
never
get
to
the
but-for
test,
because
they
will
always
ask,
well,
what
was
on
their
minds
or
what
forum
--
was
the
next
sentence
--
what
forum
was
this
litigation
in?
well,
it
was
in
the
federal
forum,
therefore,
they
are
just
federal
fees.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
it's
general
research
that
i
would
say
if
the
lawyers
did
not
specify
that
this
was
for
specifically
incremental
increase
in
the
cost
of
the
lawsuit
on
the
federal
theory,
then
they've
lost
the
opportunity
to
try
to
make
that
case.
this
is
not
a
unique
observation
in
civil
rights
litigation.
plaintiffs
lawyers
have
to
do
that
all
the
time.
they--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
i
actually
believe
that
the
court
should
not
be
evenhandedly
applying
the
same
set
of
rules,
but
we
reached
the
opposite
conclusion
about
which
side
gets
the
benefit
of
the
burden.
it
is
for
plaintiff's
benefit,
for
the
most
part,
that
this
fee
shifting
provision
was
in
the
statute.
now,
this
court
has
so
drastically
narrowed
the
range
of
cases
within
which
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
fees,
that
all
we're
talking
about
now
is
whether
the
court
is
going
to
open
up
a
new
avenue
of
fee
litigation,
and
that
is
not
for
the
frivolous
lawsuits
but
for
the
frivolous
theory
layered
onto
an
otherwise
meritorious
lawsuit.
if
i--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--my
time
is
reserved
for
rebuttal,
but
i
will
answer
the
question,
louisiana
follows
the
american
rules,
so
no
fees
on
the
state
court
claims.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
actually
like
mr.
stancil's
cake
metaphor.
what
matters
is
not
how
big
--
how
much
of
the
cake
was
devoted
to
one
claim
versus
another.
what
matters
is
how
much
more
energy
it
takes
to
bake
this
particular
sliver
of
the
cake.
it
is
all
the
same
energy.
the
central
piece
of
mr.
stancil's
argument
is
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
focus
was
only
on
the
federal
claims.
that
is
a
misreading
of
that
one
sentence,
and
mr.
stancil
keeps
eliding
the
one
critical
word
of
that
sentence,
which
was
the
district
court
said
that
they
were
not
on
notice
that
they
needed
to
separately
defend
the
state
law
claims.
our
whole
point
is
they
did
not
need
to
separately
defend
the
state
law
claims.
the
district
court
was
all
turned
around
about
the
need
to
do
something
separate.
and
the
reason
we
can
be
sure
that
justice
sotomayor's
reading
of
the
complaint
is
the
same
as
everyone
else's
is
because
the
lawyers
in
this
case,
the
defense
counsel,
did
realize
that
there
were
state
law
claims.
their
answers
are
rife
with
state
law
defenses,
and
i
refer
the
court
to
pages
50,
56,
and
66
of
the
joint
appendix.
each
one
of
them
has
three
separate
reference
to
--
references
to,
if
we
are
found
liable
under
state
law.
the
summary
judgment
motion
to
which
mr.
stancil
refers
has
a
response,
an
opposition
by
the
--
by
the
defendants,
in
which
they
caption
--
this
is
on
page
122b
--
the
caption
is
"state
law
claims
against
the
town
of
vinton.
"
now,
that's
that
earlier
summary
judgment
motion,
that
wasn't
the
11th
hour.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor,
absolutely.
there's
a
huge
amount
of
discretion.
once
we
set
the
rule,
then
the
hours
expended,
were
they
reasonable,
the
rates,
were
they
reasonable.
at
what
point
does
the
--
does
the
--
do
the
fees
trigger,
because
it
was
unreasonable
to
delay,
all
of
that
is--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--i
do
not
agree,
your
honor,
because
if
you
are
--
if
the
defendant
is
properly
in
court
and
properly
being
forced
to
do
discovery,
the
relative
importance
--
what
was
in
their
heads,
what
was
motivating
them
is
irrelevant,
unless
of
course
apropos
of
the
earlier
question,
what
was
going
on
was
they
really
ratcheted
up
because
they
lose
sleep
over
federal
claims
more
than
over
state
claims.
but,
you
know,
a
slip
and
fall,
if
you
layer
on
top
of
it
a
1983
claim,
no
one's
losing
more
sleep
over
it.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
i
think
that
would
be
exceptional
circumstance
under
which
the
district
court
would
be
entitled
to
take
into
consideration
something
that's
quite
a
bit
more
extraordinary.
and
so
i'm
not
advocating
an
--
you
know,
hard
and
fast
absolute
rule,
just
a
guideline
of
the
sort
that
this
court
routinely
adopts.
i
mean,
the
notion
that--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
actually
believe
--
if
i
may
answer
the
question,
it
is
quite
a
bit
easier
to
apply
a
but-for
test
and
review
it
on
appeal
than
it
is
to
apply
a
test
that
is
just
a
mishmash
of
factors
over,
if
which
the
stakes
are
high
enough,
and
they
will
be
under
mr.
stancil's
rule,
there
is
an
enormous
incentive
to
litigate
to
death.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
