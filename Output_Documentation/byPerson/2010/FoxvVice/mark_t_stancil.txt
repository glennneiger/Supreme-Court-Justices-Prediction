mr.
mark
t.
stancil
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
focus
first
on
the
question
of
eligibility,
but
i
do
want
to
return
later
to
why
hensley
supplies
the
correct
analysis
for
calculating
fee
awards.
much
of
petitioner's
eligibility
argument
rests
on
the
notion
that
frivolous
section
1983
claims
imposed
only
modest
or
as
he
described
them
today,
trivial
burdens
on
defendants.
and
that's
simply
not
the
case.
as
amici
who
deal
with
these
cases
on
a
daily
basis
have
confirmed,
inclusion
of
even
a
frivolous
section
1983
claim
imposes
significant
additional
burdens
as
part
of
the
litigation.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
no,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
clarify
it.
we
are
talking
now
about
calculation
of
the
award,
assuming
eligibility
aside
for
the
moment.
and
i'll
come
back--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--where
eligible,
the
standard
is,
as
under
hensley,
what
is
the
degree
of
overall
success
in
proving
that
these
claims
are
frivolous?
simply
put,
how
much
of
the
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
section
1983
was
frivolous?
and
that's
the
standard
set
forth
in
section
1988.
section
1988
does
not
reference
state
law
claims
that
may
be
factually
overlapping.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
that
would
be
something
that
a
district
court
would
take
into
account
as
part
of
its
discretion,
and
that's
exactly
the
point
of
hensley.
hensley
says
it's
hard
to
pull
some
of
these
hours
apart
in
the
ordinary
case.
now,
this
is
not
the
ordinary
case.
i
think
that's
clear.
here
the
plaintiff
did
not
even
press
his
state
law
claims
in
federal
court.
those
claims,
the
district
court
found,
were
so
deeply
buried
in
the
complaint
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
even
on
notice
that
a
defense
to
them
was
required.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
it's
at
pages
37
to
43
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
and
i
would
--
i
direct
the
court
to
page
--
specifically
to
pages
41
and
42
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
only
cause
of
action
actually
set
out
here
with
any
specificity
is
section
1983.
if
you
look
at
page
41,
it
says
the
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
afforded
by
petitioner
--
afforded
petitioner
by
our
constitution
and
laws
that
were
violated
included
--
include
but
are
not
limited
to
the
following,
and
then
he
lists
the
right
to
seek
public
office,
the
right
to
be
free
from
extortion,
the
right
to
be
protected--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes,
your
honor.
and
then--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes
--
no,
your
honor.
that's
--
that
is
what
he
said
his
right
was
denied
as
part
of
his
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
afforded
petitioner
by
our
constitution
and
laws.
he
says
on
the
next
page,
on
page
42,
and
this
is
a
critical
distinction,
and
i
think
this
was
the
premise
of
the
district
court's
finding:
he
says
petitioner
has
suffered
and
is
entitled
to
recover
reasonable
sums
for
the
following
items
of
damage
as
a
direct
result
of
actions
of
defendants;
and
that's
where
he
lists
past
and
present
--
past,
present,
and
future
emotional
distress,
embarrassment,
humiliation,
reputation,
punitive
damages,
and
other
relief,
and
other
damages
to
be
proven
at
the
trial
of
this
matter.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
your
honor--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
think
that
would
be--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
i
think
that
would
be
more
than
generous
under
the
--
in
the
context,
and
then
you
would
do
what
the
district
court
said
and
look
how
the
parties
acted
from
this
point
forward.
and
the
district
court
found
that
the
defendants,
that
these
claims
were
not
sufficient
reply
pled
--
this
is
on
pages,
i
believe,
20
--
pardon
me,
32
and
33
of
the
petition
appendix:
"plaintiff
made
certain
allegations"
--
this
is
the
district
court
--
"that
could
be
characterized
as
state
law
tort
law
claims,
but
plaintiff
did
not
plead
--
did
not
make
these
allegations
separate
from
the
section
1983--
"
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes,
your
honor,
but
it
included
a
federal
cause
of
action
that
allowed
removal
to
federal
court,
and
once
it's
in
federal
court,
it's
subject
to
the
federal
rules
for
pleading
a
claim
adequately
and
in
specificity,
and
here
the
district
court
found
these
state
law
claims,
there
was
not
a
whiff
of
them
until
the
very
tail
end,
18
months
later,
when
it
was
actually
in
response
to
the
town
of
vinton
saying,
by
the
way,
just
to
be
clear,
there
are
no
state
law
claims
here.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
your
honor,
again,
look
at
how
the
plaintiff
used
the
fact
of
extortion.
if
you
go
--
this
is
the
correspondents
--
pardon
me,
the
pleadings
on
summary
judgment
when
plaintiff
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
defendant
said
you've
said
nothing
about
under
color
of
law;
this
is
an
anonymous
claim.
he
says
he
--
he
didn't
say
this
was
a
state
law
claim
for
extortion.
he
said,
and
this
is
a
quote,
he
says:
"it
is
not
necessary
to
show
that
vice
was
acting
under
color
of
law.
"
"the
simple
act
of
extortion
is
sufficient.
"
he
picked
the
section
1983
horse.
he
rode
it
as
far
as
he
possibly
could,
and
only
at
the
11th
hour,
when
the
district
court
finally
called
him
on
to
the
carpet,
did
he
say,
okay,
i
concede
these
claims
have
no
merit,
and
then
he
backed
off
and
then
he
wanted
to
go--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--correct,
your
honor,
and
that
--
that's
how--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
that's
a
very
important
point,
your
honor.
it
i
think
is
a
false
assumption
that
every
claim
or
this
claim
or
pieces
of
this
claim
are
frivolous
on
their
face
such
that
you
can
look
at
the
complaint
and
have
it
thrown
out
of
court.
i
would
like
to
point,
your
honor,
specifically
to
the
allegation
--
this
is
on
page
39
i
believe
of
the
appendix
--
in
which
--
this
is
an
allegation
of
the
complaint
where
plaintiff
says
that
vice
printed
the
extortion
letter
at
the
police
station.
presumably
this
is
in
support
of
his
under
color
of
law
theory.
he's
deposed
--
this
is
on
page
330
and
332
of
the
joint
appendix
--
and
fox
admits
he
had
no
basis
for
that
claim.
we
can't
walk
into
federal
court
and
say
we
know
this
is
false,
we
know
he
didn't
print
this
at
the
--
at
the
police
station,
he
didn't
use
police
resources
to
do
it.
we
have
to
depose
him,
we
have
to
marshal
the
facts,
and
then
we
have
to
go
in
on
summary
judgment
and
prove
that.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
okay.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
it
would
be
within
the
district
court's
discretion.
i
think
it's
going
to
be
closer
to
20
percent
than
to
80
percent.
but
again,
this
is
the
central
message
of
hensley,
and
i
think
it's--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--he
gets
--
yes.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
at
a
--
at
a
minimum.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
correct,
he
has
--
yes.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
is
there
a
follow-up?
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
the
follow-up.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
okay.
yes,
he
gets
the
20
percent
at
a
minimum
that
are
but-for
attributable,
but
it
is
within
the
district
court's
discretion
to
award
more,
and
here's
why.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
the
burden
--
the
question
is
what
is
--
what
does
section
1983
authorize?
it
authorizes
fees
if
you're
a
prevailing
party
entitled
to
fees
in
an
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
section
1983.
in
your
honor's
hypothetical
and
in
this
case,
there
was
only
frivolous
section
1983
claims.
so
in
terms
of
fulfilling
the
--
the
mission,
the
statutory
purpose
underlying
section
1988,
i
think
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
district
court
to
say,
you
know
what,
this
entire
--
you
--
you
triggered
a
fee-shifting
statute,
the
entire
section
1983
action
was
frivolous.
and
so
i
think
it's
within
the
district
court's
discretion
to
give
them
something
more,
between
20
and
80
percent
under
those
--
under
the
hypothetical.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
because
the
plaintiff
levied
a
frivolous
--
not
just
a
faulty
or
unsuccessful,
a
frivolous
cause
of
action
under
section
1983,
and
this
is
the
point
of
--
of
why
1988
is
different
from,
say,
rule
11
and
other
provisions
that
limit
bad
faith
actions.
it's
a
policy
choice
by
congress.
there
are
burdens
allocated
to
both
sides,
and
there
are
consequences
or
may
be
consequences
within
a
district
court's
discretion.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
to
be
clear,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
we
would
be
automatically
entitled
to
80
percent.
i'm
saying
hensley,
under
the
principles
of
hensley,
the
district
court
would
have
discretion
to
award
more
than
20
percent.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
matter
to
the
outcome
of
this
case,
and
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
that.
but
the
reason
for
starting
at
what
does
--
what
is
the
1983
fee
in
total,
and
working
backwards
from
there,
is
based
on--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
section
1988
is
the
answer,
your
honor.
it
says
you
get
your
fees,
and
--
if
you're
a
defendant
and
if
it's
frivolous.
with
respect
to
an
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
section
1983,
i
think
the
but-for
rule
would
make
more
sense
if
we
were
talking
about
non-frivolous
section
1983
claims
alongside
frivolous
section
1983
claims,
because
there
the
pie
that
section
1988
is
concerned
about,
the
1983
pie,
is
chopped
up,
but
here
we
have
a
state
law
pie
and
we
have
a
1983
pie,
and
all
of
this
pie,
if
you'll
pardon
the
tortured
metaphor,
is
frivolous.
so
you
look
at
the
terms
of
the
statute.
what
has
congress
authorized?
your
fee
for
a
frivolous
section
1988
claim.
we
say,
and
for,
i
think,
good
reason,
that
it's
consistent
with
the
congressional
purpose
to
consider
whether
to
reduce
that
award.
you
do
not
have
to
award
them
the
entire
pie,
but
i
think
it
is
a
faulty
assumption.
it
doesn't
fulfill
the
purposes
of
section
1988
to
say,
well,
if
you
invoke
this
frivolous
claim
and
you
put
this
fee
shifting
on
the
table,
that
you're
immune
from
fee
shifting
as
long
as
these
claims
are
--
certain
fees
are
relevant
to
both.
but
i
do
want
to
come
back
to
why
this
makes
no
difference
to
the
outcome
of
this
case.
not
only
is
that
the
standard
that
the
fifth
circuit
announced
and
applied,
but
it
is
also
the
case
that
the
only
claims
prosecuted
in
federal
court
were
section
1983
claims.
and
here,
we
have
to
come
back
to--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
your
honor,
there's
a
difference
between
saying
these
depositions
may
be
used
and
saying
they
will
be
useful
or
finding
that
they
would
be
significant
to
the
disposition
of
the
state
law
claims.
the
district
court
said
only
--
the
first
magistrate
judge's
opinion
said
only
that
these
depositions
may
be
used.
this
is
a
simple
way
of
telling
the
parties,
you
know,
don't
come
back
to
me
and
argue
about
whether
this
deposition
was
properly
noticed
and,
you
know,
these
questions
and
answers
have
been
asked.
but
i
think
there's
a
more
fundamental
point,
your
honor,
which
is
the
district
court,
in
awarding
fees,
found
there
was
no
whiff
of
state
law
claims
until
the
very
--
very
much
the
11th
hour
in
this
claim.
and
this
is
precisely
why,
justice
sotomayor,
back
to
your
question,
we
really
need
district
courts
to
have
discretion.
if,
as
in
this
case
--
we'll
assume
there
are
state
claims
and
federal
claims,
but
as
the
district
court
found,
those
state
claims
are
deeply,
deeply
buried
in
the
weeds.
that's
precisely
the
case
in
once
--
in
which
the
district
court
needs
to
have
discretion
to
say--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--correct,
your
honor,
and
this
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
these
standards
are
administrable.
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
in
fee
awards
has
worked
and
worked
fairly
well
for
the
better
part
of
three
decades.
the
surest
way
to
invite
satellite
litigation
over
fees
is
to
--
is
to
announce
a
rule
in
which
you
have
to
say,
well,
does
it
meet
the
but-for
test
or
does
it
not
meet
the
but-for
test?
or
with
respect
to
even
eligibility,
to
say,
well,
are
they
related
or
are
they
unrelated?
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
statement
of
the
but-for
test
in
application
will
become
very
--
will
be
very
close
to
the
test
that
we're
espousing
here,
and
here's
why.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
award
fees
fairly
attribute
to
the
portion
of
the
lawsuit
that
is
declared
frivolous.
that's
the
test.
and
here's
why,
in
many
cases,
that's
going
to
be
similar
to
--
not
identical,
but
similar
to
a
but-for
test.
usually,
you
will
push
these
claims
simultaneously,
federal
claims
and
state
claims
simultaneously,
and
so
there
will
be
a
lot
of
things
that
are
--
that
go
in
both
directions.
but
in
this
case,
a
special
case
where
you
have
--
federal,
federal,
federal,
that's
all
they
said
in
district
court,
this
is
--
and
this
is
all
over
the
record,
where
every
time
the
case
is
described
back
and
forth
between
counsel,
after
the
moment
of
filing
of
the
complaint
until
we
get
to
the
summary
judgment
proceeding
18
months
later,
everybody
calls
this
a
section
1983
suit.
and
then
at
the
last
second,
there
is,
oh,
we
have
state
law
claims;
let's
go
back
to
state
court
and
litigate
those.
and
where
the
district
court
grants
the
petitioner's
--
the
plaintiff's
request
to
go
back
to
state
court,
that's
the
right
time
when
you
need
discretion
to
be
able
to
award
what
just
happened.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
because
the
only
work
done
at
the
time
of
the
fee
request
was
on
a
section
1983
claim,
because
the
state
law
claims
were
not
pursued.
and
that
was
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
says,
these
claims
were
so
deeply
buried,
you
weren't
even
on
notice.
now,
there's
a
difference.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
your
honor,
i
don't
disagree
that
there
are
questions
and
answers
in
these
depositions
that
will
be
used
in
state
court,
absolutely.
but
there's
a
difference.
what
matters
when
a
district
court
is
assessing
fees
and
evaluating
a
fee
request
is,
how
was
the
case
litigated
while
it
was
an
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
section
1983?
not
how
could
the
case
have
been
litigated;
not
how
if
you
had
also
pursued
state
law
claims,
would
these
things
have
been
relevant.
and
once
these
section
1983
claims,
all
of
them,
are
out
and
declared
frivolous,
section
1988
ceases
to
operate
in
the
sense
that
it's
no
longer
an
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
section
1983.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
there
are
several
options,
and
i
would
be
remiss
if
i
didn't
specify
that
those
state
law
claims
will
be
hotly
contested
when
they
go
to
trial
next
month,
and
i
don't
want
to
leave
any
misimpression
on
that.
but
the
district
court
has
a
series
of
options.
first
of
all,
if
the
cases
--
if
the
claims
are
going
back
to
state
court,
the
party
does
have
to
file
the
motion
for
attorney's
fees
under
rule
54.
you
have
--
you
have
to
go
in
and
say,
if
you're
--
if
there's
a
judgment
being
entered,
we
want
our
fees.
the
district
court
could
stay
the
request,
defer
it
until
the
state
court
rules
on
the
state
law
claims.
those
requests
were
not
made
here.
so
the
district
court
has
lots
of
options.
but
where
--
particularly
where
the
plaintiff
desires
to
go
back
to
state
court
and
the
federal
case
is
coming
to
an
end,
the
district
court
must
have
the
discretion
to
enter
a
fee
award
at
that
time.
and
in
fact,
that
has
been
the
case,
and
it's
specifically
mentioned
in
the
house
report
to
section
1988.
the
interim
fee
awards,
where
there's
an
order
that
disposes
of
substantial
rights,
are
permitted.
and
again,
this
is
why
you
want
discretion
in
the
hands
of
the
district
court.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
it
was
not--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
your
honor,
we--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
i
think--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--i
think
the
court
could
announce
the
principle,
that
would
helpful,
which
is,
if
the
fees
are
fairly
attributable,
within
the
district
court's
discretion,
to
the
frivolous
claim,
they
may
be
awarded,
and
then
say
1983--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
your
honor,
the
fees
fairly
attributable
to
a
1983
claim,
petitioner
says
they
have
to
be
only
attributable
to
a
1983
claim.
that's
very
much
in
dispute.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
would
be
happy
to
win
on
that
basis.
the
fifth
circuit
said
it
and
there
was
a
reason
that
it
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion,
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
award
them
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes,
your
honor.
we
think--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--we
almost
did,
your
honor.
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
--
we
win
under
either
test,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that
section
1988
is
fully
served
by
litigation
over
whether
something
is
in
the
but-for
clause--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--well,
because
only
the
1983
claims
were
pressed.
but
--
but
there's
a
--
i
think,
a
faulty
premise
in
his
position,
which
is
that
there
are
facts
over
here
and
law
over
here.
questions
that
are
specific
to
section
1983,
such
as
under
color
of
law,
municipal
policy
or
custom
are
highly
specialized,
fact
bound,
mixed
questions
of
law
and
fact.
the
idea
that
when
we're
deposing
somebody
on,
say,
sheriff
vice
or
chief
vice
on
his
conduct
in
office
that
we're
just
looking
at
what
happened,
and
that
this
is
just
a
factual
question,
i
think
that's
inaccurate.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
answer
that,
your
honor,
because
i'm
not
representing
these
parties
in
the
state
court,
but
i'll
concede
for
purposes
of
today
that
some
significant
portion.
i
wouldn't
put
a
number
on
it,
but
certainly
the
who,
i
--
who,
what,
when,
where,
why
is
relevant
to
both,
but
it's
relevant
to
how
it
was
prosecuted
in
front
of
the
district
court.
and
again,
i
think
we
have
to
put
ourselves
back
in
the
chair
of
the
district
court
on
the
bench
when
that
fee
request
comes
in.
under
petitioner's
rule
if
these
claims
had
not
been
pressed
in
federal
court
and
they're
going
to
be
remanded
at
the
plaintiff's
request,
the
district
court
has
to
speculate,
well,
how
is
this
all
going
to
go
in
state
court,
how
is
this
going
to
play
out
in
practice?
are
these
claims
going
to
be
meritorious?
are
they
not
going
to
be
meritorious?
are
they
--
how
much
of
this
is
going
to
go
to
that,
and
i
think
that's,
frankly,
not
the
burden--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--yes,
your
honor,
and
we
don't
--
we
don't
contest
that
investigating
the
facts
are
relevant
to
both,
but
it
has
to
be
pressed
in
federal
court.
it
has
to
be
during
the
action
or
proceeding
to
enforce
section
1983.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
again,
your
honor--
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
--because
the
district
court
here,
and
in
this
case,
and
it
may
not
be
in
many
cases,
but
in
this
case
the
district
court
found
the
complaint
did
not
sufficiently
allege
these
state
law
causes
of
action
to
put
the
defendants
on
notice
that
a
defense
would
be
required.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
your
--
your
honor,
that
is
precisely
what
the
district
court
said.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
and
again,
it
says,
the
court
finds
that
plaintiff
failed
to
allege
state
tort
law
violations
in
the
complaint
such
that
defendants
were
adequately
noticed,
that
a
separate
defense
as
to
these
claims
would
need
to
be
prepared
at
the
beginning
of
the
litigation.
the
record
--
this
is
on
--
that's
on
32a
of
the
petition
appendix.
it
goes
on
to
say,
the
record
reflects
that
throughout
the
litigation
the
focus
of
both
plaintiff
and
defendant
was
plaintiff's
section
1983
claim.
and
if
you
look
at
the
--
the
correspondence
between
the
parties,
the
summary
judgment
papers,
it
is
1983
from
start
to
finish,
until
--
well,
until
the
11th
hour.
and
in
fact
there's
even
a
specific
statement
in
which
the
city,
in
an
abundance
of
caution
says,
just
to
be
clear,
there
are
no
state
law
claims
here;
and
i
think
the
district
court
is
within
its
discretion.
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
examined
the
standard
of
review
for
rule
11
decisions,
and
the
court
has
held
in
cooter
&
gell
and
in
pierce
that
we
give
district
courts
very,
very
wide
berth
on
these
questions,
precisely
because
they're
on
the
ground,
they
recognize
what
the
--
what
the
standards
are
for
pleading
who
is
going
to
be
on
notice
as
to
what,
and
this
is
a
funny
case
in
that
regard.
it's
unusual
in
that
these
things
were
really
put
to
the
side
and
parked
until
the
11th
hour.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
but
they
have
to
be
judged,
and
this
is
under
the
eighth
of
these
johnson
factors,
they
have
to
be
judged
in
the
context
of
the
overall
suit
or
the
overall
action
to
enforce
section
1983.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
well,
if
we
were
--
if
we
had
--
if
as
petitioner
suggests,
this
really
was
just
an
add-on
claim,
that
it
was
a
section
1983
claim,
and
by
the
way,
you
know,
here
are
my
breach
of
contract
claims,
and,
you
know,
it
may
also
be
a
taking;
and
nobody
spent
any
time
doing
it
and
nobody
spent
a
whole
of
lot
of
--
you
know,
worried
about
the
taking
claim.
mr.
mark
t.
stancil
correct,
your
honor;
i
think
--
i
think
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that's
precisely
the
point
of
hensley;
and
again
as
this
case
comes
before
this
court,
whether
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
calculating
its
fee
award,
i
frankly
--
we
submit
that
this
--
the
judgment
should
affirmed
under
any
of
these
tests.
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions.
thank
you.
