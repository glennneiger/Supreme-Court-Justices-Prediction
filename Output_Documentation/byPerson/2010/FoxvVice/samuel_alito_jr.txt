justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
mr.
fox
had
filed
two
--
two
actions,
the
federal
claim
in
federal
court,
the
state
claims
in
state
court?
now,
the
federal
claim
is
handled
in
the
same
way
that
it
was
here.
it's
found
to
be
frivolous.
would
not
the
defendants
be
entitled
to
all
of
the
time
that
they
spent
preparing
for
the
federal
court
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you're
proceeding
on
the
assumption
which
i
--
i
think
is
certainly,
based
on
what
i
know
of
the
record,
true
here,
that
the
state
claims
are
far
from
frivolous.
but
how
is
--
let's
take
another
case,
where
it
isn't
clear
whether
the
state
claims
are
any
more
meritorious
than
the
federal
claim.
then
how
is
the
federal
judge
supposed
to
handle
the
--
the
calculation
of
attorney's
fees
in
the
separate
federal
suit?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
facts
are
--
the
facts
are
intertwined,
but
they're
two
separate
cases.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
have
claims
of
unknown
merit
in
state
court;
you
have
a
frivolous
claim
in
federal
court.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
potential
liability
on
the
frivolous
claim
is
much
greater
than
the
potential
liability
on
the
factually
interrelated
nonfrivolous
claims,
and
the
defense
argues
that
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
--
a
lot
more
time
on
these
interrelated
factual
issues
because
of
our
fear
of
the
greater
liability
on
them
than
the
frivolous
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
you
reconcile
the
test
that
the
fifth
circuit
said
it
was
applying,
which
is
--
seems
to
be
a
but-for
test,
with
the
fees
that
were
actually
awarded
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
a
question
i
asked
mr.
rosenkranz?
here,
the
argument
seems
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
the
state
law
claims
are
not
frivolous
and
may
well
be
meritorious,
but
suppose
that
the
federal
court
was
in
no
position
to
make
that
determination
at
the
time
of
the
remand.
what
is
the
federal
court
to
do
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
fifth's
circuit's
statement
--
if
the
fifth
circuit's
statement
of
the
test
it
was
applying
is
correct,
would
you
say
that
that
is
a
discretionary
determination?
the
district
court
should
have
discretion
in
making
the
--
an
apportionment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
agree
an
assessment
of
the
relative
significance
of
the
frivolous
and
nonfrivolous
claims
would
also
be
a
factor
that
would
go
into
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
there's
a
cap
on
the
liability
for
the
nonfrivolous
claim
but
not
--
maybe
treble
damages
on
the
frivolous
claim?
