justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
i
mean,
my
goodness.
you
could
say
the
same
underlying
facts
justify,
you
know,
a
suit
for
--
for
libel,
and
also
justify
a
much
--
a
much
greater
suit.
i'm
not
sure
that
we
look
to
simply
the
underlying
facts.
we
look
to
what
kind
of
liability
was
sought
to
be
imposed
upon
the
defendant.
that's
what
determines
how
much
money
the
defendant
is
willing
to
pay
for
his
lawyer,
and
how
much
he
has
to
expend
in
defending.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
how
do
you
calculate
that?
i
mean
that
--
that's
what
the
question
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
why
we
took
the
case,
to
correct
the
factual
application.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
messed
up
the
application
of
the
but-for
test.
i
thought
the
issue
before
us
whether
--
was
going
to
be
whether
the
but-for
test
is
a
proper
test,
not
whether
this
particular
court,
having
expressed
a
proper
rule,
misapplied
it.
don't
care
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
you
--
you
--
you've
done
this
several
times
in
the
course
of
your
argument,
sort
of
equating,
you
know,
the
attorney's
fees
for
frivolous
suits
with
the
normal
attorney's
fees
that
the
plaintiff
gets
when
the
plaintiff
is
victorious.
i'm
not
sure
that
we
should
treat
the
two
situations
about
the
same,
because
the
plaintiff
gets
his
attorney's
fees
whenever
the
plaintiff
wins,
whenever
the
plaintiff
wins,
whereas
the
defendant
gets
those
fees
only
when
the
plaintiff
has
brought
a
frivolous
suit,
which
should
not
have
been
done,
which
is
wrongful,
which
is
perhaps
sanctionable
under
rule
11.
i'm
not
sure
that
we
have
to
evenhandedly
apply
the
same
kind
of
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
us
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
that
it
was
only
--
it
was
only
a
1983
claim
for
the
entire
time
it
was
in
federal
court
until
the
--
until
the
very
end,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
good
does
that
do?
i
mean,
is
that
why
we
took
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
principle
of
law
that's
going
to
help
the
lower
federal
courts
would
come
out
of
that
holding?
justice
antonin
scalia
whenever
you
have
nothing
but
a
1983
case,
you
can
give
--
and
it's
frivolous,
you
can
give
attorney's
fees
right
up
to
the
limit
of
the
fees
expended,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
nobody
doubts
that,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no,
but
you're
saying
they
were
only
attributable
to
a
1983
claim
during
all
of
this
litigation
except
the
very
end.
