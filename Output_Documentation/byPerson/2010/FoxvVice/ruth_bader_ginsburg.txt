justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosenkranz,
you
knew
that,
though,
from
day
one.
this
case
is
brought
in
state
court,
it's
removed
to
federal
court.
ultimately
the
plaintiff
says:
i
recognize
that
as
a
matter
of
law
my
1983
claim
is
no
good.
but
the
plaintiff
didn't
say
that
until
18
months
after
the
--
the
transfer.
so
doesn't
the
plaintiff
have
some
responsibility
for
running
up
all
these
costs
in
the
federal
--
burdening
the
federal
court,
having
discovery
in
federal
court,
instead
of
saying
when
defendant
removed
the
case
--
either
dropping
the
federal
claim
or
conceding
at
that
point
that
it
had
no
merit
so
it's
only
the
state
claims.
i
mean,
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
plaintiff
bear
responsibility
for
keeping
that
case
in
federal
court
for
18
months?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosenkranz,
there
--
there
are
distinct
differences
in
the
1983
suit
because,
first,
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
defendant
acted
under
cover
of
state
law
--
that's
not
going
to
be
necessary
in
the
suit
for
extortion
or
defamation
--
has
to
show
that
vice
was
an
official
policymaker
for
the
city.
those
are
discrete
issues
that
relate
to
the
1983
claim
but
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
extortion/defamation
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
the
lawyer
has
to
keep
account
of
--
now,
if
i'm
going
to
spend
time
on
"under
color
of
state
law",
i
have
to
label
that
and
figure
the
hours
for
that
separately;
similarly
for
whether
vice
was
an
official
policymaker,
those
hours
that
you
are
requiring
that
--
instead
of
saying
x
number
of
hours
for
deposition
of
witness
a,
you
are
requiring
particularizing
the
issue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosenkranz,
one
--
one
piece
of
this
you
must
know
the
answer,
under
the
louisiana
law
we
have
the
extortion,
defamation,
and
emotional
distress
going
forward
in
louisiana
courts.
does
louisiana
follow
the
american
rule
so
that
plaintiff
even
--
if
the
plaintiff
prevails,
there
would
be
no
award
of
fees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
how
that
--
one
can
say
that
looking
at
the
complaint.
it
said
extortion,
emotional
distress
--
where
is
the
complaint?
let's
look
at
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right
to
be
free
from
extortion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
that
the
louisiana
pleading
rule
were
--
was
that
you
state
the
basis
of
your
claim,
and
you
do
not
have
to
plead
legal
theories;
and
if
that's
so,
then
if
this
--
defendant
removed
this
case
to
federal
court;
the
plaintiff
wanted
to
keep
it
in
state
court;
and
in
louisiana,
under
the
louisiana
pleading
rules,
it
would
have
been
perfectly
appropriate.
the
--
the
claim
alleged
gave
rise
to
extortion
claim,
the
defamation
claim;
so
this
complaint
was
filed
in
louisiana
court
that
has
a
rule
that
says
tell
us
what
happened,
and
then
you
can
have
whatever
legal
theory
you're
entitled
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
implausible,
mr.
stancil,
when
we
consider
that
of
all
the
claims
here,
the
one
that
would
seem
easiest
to
prove
is
extortion,
because
vice
was
convicted
of
extortion
in
a
criminal
proceeding?
so
if
you're
looking
look
and
you
say
what
is
the
outstanding
claim
here,
i
would
assume
that
it
was
the
extortion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
district
court
was
prompted
to
do
that
by
your
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
could
have
brought
that
motion
very
early
on.
if
this
is
a
frivolous
claim
on
its
face,
then
why
didn't
you
move
to
have
it
dismissed
immediately?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stancil,
the
first
magistrate
to
get
this
case
said
explicitly
that
the
discovery
materials,
the
discovery
in
the
federal
court,
would
be
usable
in
state
court
proceedings
where
those
materials
might
aid
in
obtaining
a
judgment.
so
doesn't
that
have
to
be
taken
into
account,
that
the
discovery
materials
developed
in
federal
court
will
now
be
used
in
the
state
court
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
certainly
conflicts
with
the
first
magistrate.
the
first
magistrate
said
use
the
material
in
the
state
for
the
state
court
proceeding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
disembodying
what
--
we
have
a
factual
scenario
here.
some
of
the
discovery
was
spent
in
determining
what
happened
with
the
alleged
racial
slur.
investigating
the
facts
of
that
claim
are
certainly
relevant
to
the
state
court
proceeding.
