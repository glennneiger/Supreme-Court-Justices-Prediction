justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
can
i
understand
what
legal
analysis
you're
proposing?
your
blue
brief
seems
to
suggest,
as
does
your
argument
a
few
minutes
ago,
that
you
want
the
sixth
circuit's
rule,
which
is
the
only
circuit
that
applies
this
rule,
that
says
when
the
facts
are
identical
and
intertwined,
the
defendant
gets
no
fees.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
of
the
other
circuits,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
don't
go
to
that
extreme.
they
say
something
closer
to
what
you
started
with,
and
your
yellow
brief
suggests,
is
a
but-for
cause:
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
those
costs
related
to
the
defense
of
the
frivolous
claim.
which
of
the
two
theories
are
you
advocating?
and
then
a
separate
question,
of
what
standard
of
review
should
be
imposed
in
those
situations
in
which
the
activities
are
so
intertwined,
but
there
is
still
a
core
essence
of
defense
of
the
federal
claim,
which
is
some
of
the
hypotheticals
my
colleagues--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--assume.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
there
are
difference
--
are
differences
in
how
we
read
those
other
circuits,
but
i'll
accept
your
proposition.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
did
the
--
the
district
court
here
said
they're
intertwined
claims,
they
all
relate
to
the
frivolous
claim,
they're
entitled
to
full
fees.
the
fifth
circuit
seemed
to
do
the
but-for
test.
are
you
agreeing
with
that?
it's
--
the
language
it
uses
sounds
like
a
but-for
test:
"a
defendant
is
only
entitled
to
attorney's
fees
for
work
which
can
be
distinctly
traced
to
frivolous
claims.
"
"we
are
confident
that
the
district
court
can
assess
the
amount
of
attorney's
fees
attributable
exclusively
to
a
plaintiff's
frivolous
claims.
"
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
think
they
misapplied
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
two.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
they
joined
the
ninth
and
the
--
and
the
other
circuits
that
have
the
but-for.
so
it's
three
places.
they
said
we're
not
joining
an
exclusive
fees
entitlement
either
way,
we're
joining
what
the
majority
of
the
circuits
are
doing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
can't
you
prove
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
can't
you
prove
that
in
a
but-for
situation?
why
don't
you
tell
me
what
you
--
your
proposed
standard
is.
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
say
if
the
federal
claim
is
frivolous,
then
you're
entitled
to
all
fees,
even
if
the
state
law
claims
overlap
and
have
merit
or
potential
merit.
i
think
--
is
that
your
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
eligibility,
it
has
to
be
a
frivolous
claim,
that's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
i
thought
what
congress
said
and
what
we've
said
in
hensley,
that
the
only
thing
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
fees
for
is
the
burden
of
the
frivolous
federal
claim.
your
--
your
answer
to
justice
kagan
is
suggesting
that
even
if
the
plaintiff
wins,
wins
everything
they
were
seeking,
you're
still
entitled
to
80
percent
of
your
fees,
even
though
the
federal
claim
didn't
add
anything
to
your
work
--
to
your
work,
except
20
percent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
tell
me
why
we
would,
given
the
differences
that
we've
announced
in
hensley
between
prevailing
plaintiffs
and
prevailing
defendants
--
because
you
can
only
prevail
as
to
a
frivolous
fee.
why
do
we
start
with
your
entitlement
to
your
entire
fee
and
deduct
from
it,
instead
of
starting
the
other
way,
which
seems
more
logical,
which
is
you're
entitled
to
the
fees
related
to
your
frivolous
claim,
so
why
don't
you
have
to
prove
that
first?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
no,
no,
no.
we're
assuming
a
lawsuit
that
has
--
as
this
one,
that
has
both
federal
and
state
claims
and
only
one
--
whether
it's
one
frivolous
federal
claim
or
multiple
federal
claims
and
two
are
frivolous,
one
is
not,
and
there
is
a
bunch
of
state
court
claims.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
do
we
start
with
your
total
fee
and
deduct
down,
rather
than
start
where
all
the
circuits
are
starting,
which
is
to
say,
what
can
be
attributed
to
that
frivolous
claim,
which
is
the
only
thing
you're
entitled
to
fees
from?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
every
other
circuit
except
for
the
sixth
has
dealt
with
the
but-for
test
or
some
variant
of
it.
even
the
fifth
did
it
in
this
case
and
ruled
in
your
favor.
what
you're
asking
for
is,
i
think,
very
akin
to
the
opposite
rule
of
saying
if
we
dismiss
the
federal
litigation,
you're
not
entitled
to
any
fees,
because
this
case
was
about
--
is
in
federal
court,
so
that's
the
only
thing
that
matters.
that
seems
to
be
your
rule.
every
other
circuit
has
some
variant
of
but-for,
and
they
seem
to
manage
it
just
fine.
nobody
likes
attorney's
fees.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
espouse
your
test
for
me,
because
i
still
don't
understand
it
except
for
flipping
through
hensley,
but
hensley
has
a
different
predicate,
which
is
that
plaintiffs
are
--
if
they
win,
they're
entitled
to
fees.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
what
that
means,
because
if
you're
taking
discovery
on
the
state
law
issues,
defamation,
extortion,
et
cetera,
you're
pressing
it.
at
the
point
that
the
federal
action
is
dismissed
you
no
longer
can
pursue
that
in
federal
court
to
its
conclusion.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
why
would
--
if
you
have
a
bunch
of
different
claims
and
the
facts
support
some
of
the
state
court
actions,
why
should
you
be
entitled
to
fees
that
you
would
have
incurred
in
state
court
no
matter
what?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
you
--
are
you
seriously
contending
that
the
lawyer
below
didn't
understand
that
the
defamation
and
the
extortion
claims
were
part
of
this
case?
i'm
hard
pressed
to
believe
that
reading
that
complaint
would
not
doubt
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--found?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
basically
the
only
difference
you
have
with
the
--
with
the
fifth
circuit
is
that
you
would
say
fees
fairly
attributable
to
federal
claims
as
opposed
to
fees
exclusively
attributable
to
federal
claims;
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
your
presumption
would
be
that
if
the
fees
are
--
support
both
state
and
federal
claims,
you're
still
entitled
to
fees?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
still
--
i
don't
understand
what
that
means.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
want
district
courts
to
determine
how
important
the
1983
claim
was
in
relationship
to
the
state
claim?
