justice
elena
kagan
and
mr.
rosenkranz,
in
this
case
what's
your
understanding
of
the
approximate
percentage
of
time
that
was
spent
on
the
federal
issues
that
justice
ginsburg
was
talking
about?
justice
elena
kagan
so
there
was
no
significant
motions
practice
on
these
issues?
there
was
no
particular
discovery
on
issues
of
state
action
and
so
forth?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
stancil,
can
i
get
you
to
just
think
about
a
hypothetical
with
me?
there's
a
plaintiff
and
he
files
a
suit
and
it
has
a
state
claim
and
a
federal
claim;
and
the
federal
claim
is
a
really
bad
claim,
it's
frivolous;
and
it
eventually
gets
tossed
out,
and
it's
--
it's
labeled
frivolous.
but
the
state
claim
is
a
really
good
claim
and
it
wins,
all
right?
the
plaintiff
has
requested
$100,000
and
the
plaintiff
gets
$100,000
because
he's
won
on
the
state
claim.
now,
here
are
the
legal
fees.
the
legal
fees
are
20
percent
was
incurred
solely
for
the
state
claim,
20
percent
was
incurred
solely
for
the
federal
claim,
and
60
percent
was
incurred
in
both
because
there
were
overlapping
issues
and
it's
just
impossible
to
tear
them
apart.
justice
elena
kagan
what
are
the
fees
in
that
case
according
to
you?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
so
--
but
--
so
in
other
words,
you're
saying
he
gets
all
the
work,
the
defendant
gets
the
work
done
on
the
federal
claim
notwithstanding
that
the
plaintiff
has
gotten
his
entire
relief;
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
all
the
work
that
is--
justice
elena
kagan
--even
though
the
plaintiff
has,
from
the
plaintiff's
view
has
completely
won
the
lawsuit.
justice
elena
kagan
go--
justice
elena
kagan
--no.
go
ahead.
justice
elena
kagan
and
--
and
--
okay,
go
ahead,
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
so
but
on
that
theory,
the
--
the
plaintiff
would
be
paying
the
defendant's
fees
for
work
done
where
the
plaintiff
won.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
what
percentage
of
the
work
done
has
actually
been
useful
to
you
in
defending
the
state
court
claims,
approximate?
justice
elena
kagan
this
case
concerns
the
proper
interpretation
of
a
federal
fee-shifting
statute
called
section
1988,
which
allows
the
courts
to
award
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
to
the
prevailing
party
in
certain
civil
rights
lawsuits.
we
have
held
in
prior
cases
that
the
defendant
may
receive
attorney's
fees
under
the
statute
if
the
suit
against
him
was
frivolous.
this
case
asks
us
to
consider
what
happens
when
part
of
the
suit
but
only
part
of
the
suit
was
frivolous.
is
the
defendant
entitled
to
any
fees
and
if
so,
how
should
they
be
calculated?
the
case
arises
out
of
an
election
for
chief
of
police
in
the
town
of
vinton
louisiana.
the
challenger
ricky
fox
alleged
that
the
incumbent
billy
ray
vice
used
an
assortment
of
dirty
tricks
to
try
to
force
him
out
of
the
race.
vice's
various
machinations
didn't
work.
fox
won
the
election
and
vice
was
ultimately
convicted
of
criminal
extortion.
but
fox,
the
winner
of
the
election,
went
on
to
sue
vice
and
he
asserted
both
state
law
claims
like
defamation
and
also
federal
civil
rights
claims.
vice,
the
defendant
removed
the
case
to
federal
court
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
claims.
at
the
end
of
discovery,
fox,
the
plaintiff,
admitted
that
his
federal
claims
were
not
valid.
and
the
district
court
dismissed
them,
remanding
the
case
to
the
state
court
to
resolve
the
remaining
state
law
claims.
vice
once
again
remember
the
defendant
sought
attorney's
fees
under
section
1988
on
the
grounds
that
fox's
federal
claims
had
been
frivolous.
the
district
court
agreed
with
that
and
then
granted
vice
fees
for
all
the
work
his
attorneys
had
done
on
the
suit,
the
entire
suit,
even
though
only
fox's
federal
claims
were
frivolous
and
his
state
law
claims
had
yet
to
be
considered.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
that
award.
we
now
reverse.
we
presume
that
the
federal
claims
here
were
frivolous
and
the
state
claims
were
not.
and
we
agree
with
the
courts
below
that
the
defendant
may
receive
some
fees
in
a
mixed
suit
like
this
one
where
only
some
of
the
plaintiff's
claims
are
frivolous.
but
he
is
entitled
only
to
the
fees
he
paid
because
of
frivolous
claims
alone.
he
is
not
entitled
the
fees
he
would
have
paid
anyway
to
defend
against
the
nonfrivolous
claims.
the
test
can
be
stated
as
a
'but
for'
rule.
he
is
entitled
to
the
fees
that
he
would
not
have
paid
but
for
the
frivolous
claims.
this
test
comes
directly
from
congress'
purpose
in
enacting
the
statute
to
relieve
defendants
of
the
burden
associated
with
fending
off
frivolous
litigation.
so
if
the
defendant's
attorneys
would
have
done
the
same
work
anyway,
even
if
the
frivolous
claims
had
not
been
in
the
suit
then
fee-shifting
is
not
allowed.
if
it
were,
defendants
would
be
relieved
of
some
of
the
costs
of
defending
against
normal
nonfrivolous
litigation.
and
section
1988
was
never
intended
to
give
defendants
that
kind
of
windfall.
the
courts
below
failed
to
adopt
--
failed
to
apply
this
'but
for'
test.
fox's
suit
involved
frivolous
federal
claims
and
nonfrivolous
state
law
claims,
but
all
of
them
were
closely
related
arising
out
of
vice's
conduct
in
the
campaign
and
requiring
proof
of
the
same
basic
facts.
so
even
if
fox
have
filed
only
his
state
law
claims,
the
nonfrivolous
ones,
it
is
likely
that
vice's
attorneys
would
have
done
much
the
same
work,
would
have
taken
the
same
depositions,
review
the
same
documents
and
so
on.
and
if
that
is
so,
vice
is
not
entitled
to
fees
for
that
work.
because
the
courts
below
failed
to
analyze
the
issue
in
this
way,
we
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
remand
the
case
for
application
of
the
proper
standard.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
