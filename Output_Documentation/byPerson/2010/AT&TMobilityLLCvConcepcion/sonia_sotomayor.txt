what's
the
difference,
then,
with
the
act
that
you
are
positing?
a
state
comes
in
--
or
i
should
ask:
is
there
no
difference
between
a
state
saying
these
terms
in
a
contract
are
unconscionable,
making
the
petitioner
always
pay
the
fees
and
making
him
or
her
arbitrate
in
a
different
state
--
that
is
unconscionable
--
or
a
general
rule
of
state
law
that
says
in
a
contract
of
adhesion
the
stronger
party
can't
impose
undue
cost
or
expenses
on
the
other
side
to
vindicate
their
rights,
whether
it's
in
litigation
and/or
arbitration.
in
your
mind,
there
is
no
difference
between
those
two
things,
between
these
two
approaches
to
the
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they're
not
requiring--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
they're
not
requiring
arbitration--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--they
are
not
saying
you
have
to
arbitration
--
class
actions
in
all
arbitration
proceedings.
they
are
identifying
a
class
of
cases
in
which
they
pursue
the
state,
who's
their
own
sovereign,
and
the
savings
clause
in
the
faa
permits
them
in
law
or
equity
to
set
forth
rules
to
say
in
this
subset
of
cases
there
is
a
substantive
right
being
affected.
that
is
different
than
rules
that
are
looking
at
procedures
and
setting
uniform
procedures
in
both.
how
do
we
draw
the
line
between
a
law
that
says
discovery
has
to
happen
in
arbitration,
and
one
that
says
a
--
in
a
contract
of
adhesion,
if
the
superior
party
retains
the
right
to
do
discovery
but
tells
the
inferior
party,
you
can't?
and
a
state
says,
that's
unconscionable.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
then
we
have
--
we
have
to
serve
as
reviewers
of
state
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
states
are
doing
in
--
to
interpret
their
own
laws?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then,
mr.
pincus--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i've
asked
your
adversary
this
question
and
i'm
not
sure
yet
what
his
answer
is,
so
i'm
asking
you
it.
how
would
you
propose
to
distinguish
between
facially
neutral
contract
law
defenses
that
implicitly
discriminate
against
arbitration
and
those
that
do
not?
what's
the
test
you
would
use
to
tell
the
difference
between
the
two?
because
obviously
there
are
subterfuges
that
some
legal
systems
could
use
to
address
themselves
just
to
arbitration.
so
how
do
we
tell
the
difference?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
we
test
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
other
than
--
i
don't
want
to
look
through
legislative
history
and
determine
whether
some
committee
person
said
something
that
sounds
like
subterfuge.
how
do
i
look
at
the
law
and
its
effects
and
determine
that
subterfuge
or
that
discrimination?
