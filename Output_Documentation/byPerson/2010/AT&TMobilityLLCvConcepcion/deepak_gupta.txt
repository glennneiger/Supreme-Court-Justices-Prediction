mr.
deepak
gupta
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
think
several
of
the
questions
this
morning
have
brought
out,
the
question
here
is
not
what
this
court
would
decide
if
it
were
sitting
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
applying
the
state's
common
law
in
the
first
instance.
rather,
the
question
is
whether
the
state
law
at
issue
falls
within
a
statutory
savings
clause
that
expressly
preserves
contract
defenses
available
at
law
or
in
equity.
the
state
law
at
issue
here
is
not
preemptive,
for
three
reasons.
first,
it
is
consistent
with
the
equal
footing
principle
or
nondiscrimination
principle
that
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
is
embodied
in
section
2.
second,
it's
consistent
with
two
key
purposes
that
the
savings
clause
fulfills
under
the
faa:
ensuring
that
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
consent
and
not
coercion;
and
that
it
represents
merely
a
choice
of
forum,
but
not
an
exemption
from
the
law.
and
third,
the
state
law
at
issue
is
a
correct
and
legitimate
application
of
the
state's
common
law
to
which
this
court
should
defer.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
let
me
be
clear
about
what
i
mean
by
the
second
reason.
i
think
that
the
savings
clause
in
the
faa
serves
two
critical
purposes,
and
that
is
that
the
--
the
contract
law
doctrines
ensure
consent.
you
don't
have
arbitration
unless
you
have
a
consensual
agreement
between
both
parties,
and
you
look
to
state
contract
law
to
determine
whether
there
is
consent.
and
also,
i
think
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
about
arbitration
under
the
faa,
it
represents
a
choice
of
forum,
but
it
doesn't
withdraw
the
parties
from
the
substantive
liability
rules
of
the
state.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
a
--
it's
a
question
of
state
law
whether
the
determination
is
ex
ante
or
ex
post.
but
we
actually--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
right.
and
the
discover
bank
application
of
state
unconscionability
law
we
believe
is
an
ex
ante
analysis.
it
looks
at
whether
the
contract
is
fair
or
exculpatory
at
the
time
that
the
contract
is
made;
and
indeed
there
is
--
the
two
arguments
that
mr.
pincus
made
about
california
unconscionability
law
are
somewhat
at
war
with
themselves.
he
said
that
the
--
the
doctrine
looks
to
third
parties
and
that
that's
illegitimate;
and
he
said
that
the
doctrine
is
ex
post
and
that's
illegitimate.
but
in
fact,
from
the
perspective
of
a
consumer
that's
entering
into
this
contract,
from
the
perspective
of
any
at&t
consumer,
they
don't
know
whether
they
are
going
to
be
among
the
very
few
consumers
who
detect
fraud,
recognize
a
legal
claim,
or
hire
a
lawyer
to
do
so,
and
come
forward
and
seek
compensation.
and
so
the
concepcions
are
situated
just
like
any
other
at&t
customer,
and
that
is
the
point
at
which
fairness
is
assessed.
so
from
the
perspective
of
california
unconscionability
doctrine,
the
concepcions
and
--
and
all
the
other
at&t
customers
are
not
differently
situated.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
the
concepcions,
once
they
have
chosen
to
make
a
claim,
whether
the
contract
is
then
fair
to
them;
it's
whether
it's
fair
to
any
at&t
customer.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
i
think,
first
of
all,
the
california
state
law
is
applying
an
exculpatory
clause
prohibition
that
has
been
on
the
books
since
1872
in
california.
and
if
you
look
at
the
cases,
many
of
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief
today--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--no.
in
fact,
the
--
the
california
courts
have
developed
a
test
that
says,
we'll
--
we'll
enforce
exculpatory
clauses,
or
what
would
otherwise
be
exculpatory
clauses,
if
they
don't
have
significant
public
effects.
so
the
test
under
that
statute
is
actually
to
look
to
the
public
effects,
the
effects
of
similarly
situated
people
that
are
parties
to
the
contract.
and
for
example,
there
was
a
case
in
the
early
20th
century
under
that
statute
where
the
question
was
whether
a
banking
contract
was
unfair;
and
what
the
court
said
is
that
--
that
parties
to
the
contract
are
not
the
only
people
that
matter
here;
what
matters
is
the
interests
of
the
banking
public.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
again,
i
want
to
try
to
explain
why
i
don't
think
that
the
concepcions
are
--
are
any
different
from
the
--
what
mr.
pincus
is
describing
as
third
parties.
at
the
time
that
they
entered
into
the
contract,
the
question
is
whether
the
contract
ex
ante
is
unconscionable
as
to
them.
and
they're
just
like
anyone
else.
they
don't
know
whether
they
will
detect
this
fraud
and
be
able
to
come
forward.
and
so
the
question
is
--
is
that
--
is
that
unconscionable
as
to
them?
it's
not
looking
only
to
the
effects
on
third
parties.
but
there
is
also
an
exculpatory
clause
prohibition
that
has
always
taken
into
account
the
effects
on
the
public.
and
both
of
those
are
at
work
in
discover
bank.
mr.
deepak
gupta
right.
the
california--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--because
from
an
ex
ante
perspective,
again
when
they
enter
into
the
contract,
they
have
--
there
--
it's
not
reasonable
to
be
--
to
expect
that
they
will
be
among
the
very
few
people
who
will
recognize
that
there's
fraud,
recognize
a
legal
claim,
and
come
forward.
and
so
from
that
perspective,
it
--
it
is
not
reasonable
them
--
for
them
to
give
up
the
benefits
that
they
would
get
from
a
class
action.
a
class
action
incentivizes
lawyers
and
others
to
detect
for
this
fraud.
it
makes
it
--
it
makes
it
economically
justifiable
to
come
forward
with
these
kinds
of
claims.
mr.
deepak
gupta
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
mean,
obviously
it's
impossible
to
come
up
with
a
precise
analogy
that
is
going
to
be
on
all
fours.
but
in
our
case
we
cite
--
in
our
brief
we
cite
cases
involving
unreasonably
shortened
statutes
of
limitations,
where
the
california
courts
for
over
100
years
have
found
that
those
can
be
deemed
unconscionable.
and
the
principle
is
the
same.
those
kinds
of
clauses
can
interfere
with
the
parties'
ability
to
have
notice
that
they
have
a
claim
and
take
action
on
that
claim.
that
--
that
kind
of
procedural
limitation
has
always
been
deemed
unconscionable.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
under
this
clause
the
consumer
will
always
have
the
ability
to
proceed
on
a
bilateral
--
on
a
bilateral
basis.
mr.
deepak
gupta
i
mean
that's
true
anyway,
right?
the
the
mine
run
of
consumer
waivers--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
and
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding
your
question,
but
i
think,
you
know,
that's
true
of
any
of
the
procedural
limitations
that
the
petitioners
concede
would
be
subject
to
the
unconscionability
doctrine.
a
person
would
still
be
free
to
proceed
under
a
basis
that
would
otherwise
be
unconscionable.
for
example,
if
you
had
an
arbitration
clause
that
limited
important
remedies
--
it
banned
punitive
damages,
injunctive
relief,
insisted
on
a
distant
forum,
required
excessive
fees
--
those
would
be
unconscionable
as
a
matter
of
state
contract
law,
or
could
be
anyway,
but
the
consumer
would
still
have
the
ability
to
proceed
on
that
basis.
mr.
deepak
gupta
right,
and
we
don't
deny
that's
true.
but
it's
not
that
different
from
the
way
this
court
approaches
state
law
in
general.
you
start
from
a
position
of
deference.
the
court
says
this
is
facially
nondiscriminatory
law,
it's
generally
applicable,
but
there's
a
limit
on
that.
if
the
state
law
is
--
if
the
state
is
engaging
in
obvious
subterfuge
to
deny
federally
protected
rights,
this
court
has
always
said--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--that
there
is
a
limit--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--i
think
in
the
first
instance
it
would
be
an
objective
determination.
you
would
see
whether
the
state
court
is
telling
the
truth.
is
this
law
really
being
applied
in
the
same
way
in
the
arbitration
context
and
outside
of
the
arbitration
context.
and
here
we
know
because,
as
justice
kagan
said,
the
first
california
appellate
case
on
point
is
a
case
outside
of
the
arbitration
context,
the
america
online
case.
the
discover
bank
case
relied
on
that
case
when
it
struck
down
a
class-action
ban
in
the
arbitration
context.
mr.
deepak
gupta
that's
not
in
the
federal
arbitration
act,
your
honor,
but
in
mullaney
v.
wilbur
case
and
other
cases
where
the
court
is
describing
the
limits
on
deference
to
state
law,
those
are
the
kinds
of
standards
the
court
has
used.
if
it's
not
a
credible
rule
of
state
law,
if
the
state
is
not
really
doing
what
its
saying,
and
the
result
is
the
deprivation
of
federally
protected
rights,
this
court
has
always
said
that
there's
a
limit
on
deference
to
state
law.
now--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--well,
i'm
addressing
--
justice
sotomayor's
question,
if
i
understand
it,
is
when
you
have
a
facially
nondiscriminatory
rule
of
contract
law,
where
when
you
look
at
the
face
of
the
opinion
nothing
suggests
it's
nondiscriminatory.
and
the
question
is
how
do
you
tell
whether
the
state
court
is
not
telling
the
truth?
and
i
think
in
that
circumstance
you'd
have
to
--
i
can't
think
of
any
other
way
you
would
do
the
analysis.
mr.
deepak
gupta
obviously
we
concede
that
those
kinds
of
rules
are
preempted.
mr.
deepak
gupta
right.
i
think
there
are
two
limiting
principles
in
addition
to
the
discrimination
inquiry.
discrimination
doesn't
get
you
there.
you
can
then
ask,
is
the
rule
tantamount
to
a
rule
of
non-enforceability
of
arbitration
agreements.
so
for
example,
if
a
state
law
says
you
cannot
waive
the
right
to
a
public
jury
trial.
now,
obviously
that
renders
all
arbitration
agreements
unenforceable.
it
contradicts
the
general
rule
of
enforceability.
to
read
the
savings
clause
to
allow
a
rule
like
that
would
be
to
read--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--i
think
that
would
bring
into
play
the
second
limiting
principle,
because
parties
could
contract,
obviously,
to
agree
to
certain
procedural
rules
like
that.
but
i
think
that
that
would
bring
into
play
a
principle
of
obstacle
preemption.
mr.
deepak
gupta
right.
i
think
one
of
the
purposes
--
we
agree
with
petitioners
about
this.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
to
allow
parties
to
contract
their
procedures,
to
tailor
their
procedures;
and
in
general
the
courts
ought
not
to
be
interfering
with
those
kinds
of
consensual
decisions.
but
there
are
two
other
important
purposes
at
play,
and
no
statute
pursues
its
purposes
at
all
costs.
one
of
those
purposes
is
to
ensure
that
there's
not
coercion,
that
you
have
a
consensual
agreement;
and
another,
just
as
important,
is
to
ensure
that
arbitration
merely
represents
a
change
of
forum,
but
isn't
an
exemption
from
the
law.
so
that's
--
i
think
that's
at
work
in
the
examples
that
petitioner
concedes.
mr.
deepak
gupta
i
think
stolt-nielsen
is
properly
read
as
--
the
questions
there
was
a
question
of
contract
interpretation.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
agreement
is
valid
in
the
first
place,
whether
you
have
a
contract.
what
stolt-nielsen
tells
you
is
that
you
cannot
impose
class
arbitration
on
an
unwilling
defendant.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
the
defendant
here
has
specified
in
its
arbitration
agreement
that
if
the
class-action
ban
is
invalidated,
it
would
prefer
to
face
any
class-wide
proceedings
in
court,
and
that
choice
is
up
to
the
defendant.
if
the
defendant
chose
to
face
class-wide
proceedings
in
arbitration,
they
could
do
so
under
--
under
the
california
rule,
or
they
could
elect
to
do
so
in
court,
and
they
could
do
so
under
whatever
procedures
they
specified
in
the
agreement
or
that
were
specified
in
a
subsequent
agreement
between
the
parties.
california
law
doesn't
impose
any
particular
procedures
on
the
party.
it
just
insists
that
in
circumstances
where
the
ban
would
function
as
an
exculpatory
clause,
that
there
is
some
avenue
for
class-wide
proceedings,
where
claims
wouldn't
feasibly
be
litigated
individually.
i
don't--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--i
think
one
answer
to
that
is
that
some
parties
have
chosen
class
arbitration,
and
we
cite
some
examples
in
the
brief.
there
have
also
been
hundreds
of
class
arbitrations
conducted
by
the
american
arbitration
association,
the
leading
arbitration
association.
class
arbitration
has
existed
for
a
quarter
century,
so
it's
not
something
that
is
foreign
to
arbitration.
but
also,
i
just
refer
back
to
what
i
said
to
justice
ginsburg,
which
is
that
this
is
a
matter
of
consent.
nobody
is
forcing
defendants
to
face
class
arbitration,
and
nobody
is
forcing
them
to
face
it
on
terms
that
they
haven't
consented
to.
so
if
there
are
concerns
about
--
about
the
ability
of
class
arbitration
to
effectively
manage
the
process,
they
can
be
tailored
by
the
parties.
and
in
fact,
there
are
even
hybrid
procedures
where--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--i
mean,
one
could
say
the
same
thing
about
many
of
the
procedural
limitations
that
both
parties
agree
are
subject
to
the
unconscionability
doctrine.
if
a
defendant
said:
well,
we
don't
want
to
face
arbitration
unless
we
can
ban
punitive
damages
or
other
important
remedies,
unless
we
can
insist
on
certain
kinds
of
discovery
limitations
that
the
state
courts
deem
unconscionable
because
they
don't
allow
the
parties
to
vindicate
their
rights
individually,
the
same
argument
would
hold
true.
the
defendant
would
be
able
to
say:
well,
that's
--
you
know,
if
we
can't
have
arbitration
on
our
terms,
we
won't
have
arbitration
at
all.
that
is
not
what
the
federal
arbitration
act
says,
though.
the
federal
arbitration
act
puts
arbitration
agreements
on
an
equal
footing
with
other
contracts.
it
forbids
states
from
discriminating
against
arbitration,
but
it
doesn't
require
them
to
remove
all
impediments
that
--
that
a
party
may
wish
removed
to
have
arbitration
on
their
terms,
even
where
it
would
effectively
exculpate--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--that's
right.
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
i
think
--
you
know,
we
concede
that
if
the
california
courts
were
discriminating
against
arbitration
agreements,
if
they
were
applying
one
rule
to
class-action
bans
or
other
kinds
of
procedural
limitations
in
arbitration
and
another
outside
of
arbitration,
that
would
not
fall
within
the
savings
clause.
mr.
deepak
gupta
i
think
in
the
first
instance,
i
don't
think
that
--
i'm
assuming
that
you're
describing
a
rule
that
purports
to
apply
general
contract
law,
let's
say
unconscionability;
right?
mr.
deepak
gupta
i
don't
think
--
i
think
it
would
be
hard
for
a
state
to
credibly
claim
that
the
absence
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
systematically
exculpate
one
party
from
--
from
liability.
that
just--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--well,
whether
or
not
they
constitute
discrimination
against
arbitration,
i
think
your
first
hypothetical
would
be
preempted,
because
a
state
could
not
credibly
be
serving
the
purposes
that
the
savings
clause
serves
in
insisting
on
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
deepak
gupta
because
--
because
i
don't
think
that
a
credible
argument
can
be
made
that
that
systematically
serves
and
functions
as
an
exculpatory
clause.
there
are
going
to
be
questions
of
degree
here,
but
take,
for
example,
discovery.
i
think
that
both
parties
would
agree
that
if
an
employer
said:
i
get
discovery
and
you,
the
employee,
don't
get
discovery
for
your
fact-bound
discrimination--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--no,
i
think
--
i
think
--
i
think
a
better
way
to
analyze
that
is
under
the
rubric
of
obstacle
preemption,
because
there
are
important
purposes
that
are
served
by
the
savings
clause
in
invalidating
certain
procedural
procedures
that
have
an
exculpatory
effect,
a
substantively
unfair
effect,
but
at
the
same
time
the
act,
to
be
able
to
function,
has
to
allow
parties
to
contract
for--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
no,
i
think
--
i
think
that's
not
right.
i
mean,
i
think
in
the
first
instance
you
defer
to
what
the
state
court
says
it
is
doing,
and
what
the
state
says
it
is
doing
--
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
this
--
is
that
it
is
preventing
a
procedural
limitation
that
systematically
favors
one
party,
tilts
the
playing
field
to
a
degree
that
parties
cannot
feasibly
vindicate
their
claims
through
arbitration.
mr.
deepak
gupta
right.
and,
i
mean,
obviously,
the
application
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
don't
have
a
systematic
effect
that
favors
one
party
or
the
other,
and
--
and
so
i
think
a
rule
like
that
would
not
be
credible.
and
i'm
trying
to
answer
your
hypothetical,
but
i
do
think
that
the
discovery--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--i
think
you
have
to
look
first
at
what
the
state
law
is
trying
to
do,
and
the
--
the
hypotheticals
about
the
insistence
on
jury
trials,
insistence
on
federal
rules
of
evidence
or
civil
procedure,
those
are
clear
--
it
just
would
not
be
credible
for
a
state,
i
think,
to
say
that
those
things
are
required.
mr.
deepak
gupta
i
think
you
can
look
to
both.
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
to
both.
i
mean,
it
would
pose
an
obstacle
to
the
statute,
whether
the
state
was
doing
something
antithetical
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute
or
whether
it
had
the
effect
of
destroying
arbitration.
in
either
case,
those
things
would
be
preempted.
but
all
of
these
hypotheticals
describe
rules
that
don't
exist
under
any
state's
laws
and
are
unlikely
to
exist,
because
they
--
they
can't
--
they
wouldn't
really
be
able
to
be
reconciled
with
traditional
notions
of
contract
law,
and
then
you
really
would
have
obvious
subterfuge.
you
really
would
have
a
rule
that
is
not
true
state
law.
but
--
but
i
think
if
you
look,
for
example,
at
discovery,
a
state
could
not
insist
on
plenary
discovery,
full
discovery,
to
the
same
degree
available
in
courts,
but
a
state
can
certainly
insist
on
invalidating
one-sided
discovery
limitations.
a
state
could
certainly
say
to
someone
who
seeks
to
vindicate
a
fact-bound
employment
discrimination
claim
has
to
have
some
opportunity
to
develop
the
facts.
otherwise,
that
--
that
is
exculpatory.
mr.
deepak
gupta
right.
i
think
you
are
right
justice
kennedy,
and
i
think
the
difficulty
of
ascertaining
what
is
sort
of
at
the
essential
core
of
arbitration
means
that
the
--
that
the
test
of
what's
tantamount
to
a
rule
of
non-enforceability
is
going
to
be
--
it's
going
to
be
a
very
small
category.
it's
going
to
describe
the
ouster
doctrine,
the
jury
trial
waiver
of
prohibition;
and
i
think
that's
why
you
have
got
to
resort
to
some
principle
of
obstacle
preemption
to
figure
out
whether
the
state
is
--
is
legitimately
fulfilling
the
purposes,
the
important
purposes
that
the
savings
clause
serves,
or
whether
it's
just
insisting
on
full-scale
procedures
for
the
sake
of
it,
in
ways
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
the
state
policing
its
own
marketplace,
protecting
its
substantive
rules
of
liability
and
ensuring
that
parties
can
adequately
vindicate
their
claims.
and
if
a
state
is
doing
that,
i
think
that
kind
of
rule--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--well,
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
that
is
not
the
rule
of
law
that
this
state
has
announced.
the
state
has
made
a
judgment
that
if
you
preclude
class-wide
relief,
that
will
mean
--
that
will
gut
the
state's
substantive
consumer
protection
laws,
because
people
will
--
in
the
context
of
small
frauds
not
be
able
to
bring
those
cases.
mr.
deepak
gupta
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
