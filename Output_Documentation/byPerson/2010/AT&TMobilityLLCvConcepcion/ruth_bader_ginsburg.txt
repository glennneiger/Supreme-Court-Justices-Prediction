justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
is
nothing
that
indicates
that
california's
laws
are
applying
a
different
concept
of
unconscionability.
you
haven't
come
up
and
said,
oh,
look
what
they
did
here.
and
in
another
case
they
said
it
has
to
shock
the
conscience.
maybe
across
the
board,
california
is
saying:
we
think
that
unconscionability
should
have
a
broader
meaning.
is
it
unfair
to
the
weaker
party
to
the
bargain?
is
there
really
no
genuine
agreement
here?
and
if
that
is
so,
that
will
fit
our
definition
of
unconscionability.
you
don't
have
anything
that
says
--
the
california
court
hasn't
said:
we
are
applying
a
special
definition
of
unconscionability
to
arbitration
agreements.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
any
contract
that
would
have
an
arbitration
clause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
criticize
one
feature
of
this?
you
are
not
claiming
that,
vis
a
vis
litigation,
arbitration
is
being
disfavored,
which
was
the
original
concern
about
arbitration
agreements
and
what
prompted
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
courts
didn't
like
to
have
their
business
taken
away,
and
so
they
were
disfavoring
arbitration
contracts.
that
is
no
part
of
the
picture
here,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
because
the
rule
is
the
same
whether
it's
litigation
or
arbitration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
pincus,
are
they
necessarily
saying
that?
as
i
read
it,
the
plaintiff
brought
a
case
to
court,
not
to
arbitration,
and
then
there
was
a
motion
to
stay
the
state
court
litigation.
why
isn't
it
a
proper
reading
of
this
case
to
say:
you
want
--
if
you
are
in
the
arbitration
forum,
it's
bilateral,
but
you
can't
dupe
these
plaintiffs
out
of
a
class
action?
so
if
you
don't
have
a
class
action
in
arbitration,
you
can
have
it
in
court.
that
is,
the
class
action
is
preserved,
not
necessarily
in
the
arbitration
forum,
but
in
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
we
look
at
the
california
law
and
we
find
other
instances
of
unconscionability
that
are
applying
a
standard
less
stringent
than
"shock
the
conscience",
then
we
would
say
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gupta,
is
--
i'd
like
you
to
focus
on
stolt-nielsen.
in
stolt-nielsen
this
court
said
that,
absent
express
consent,
no
class
arbitration.
if
the
seller
or
employer,
whoever
it
is,
doesn't
want
that
class
arbitration,
doesn't
have
to
have
it.
and
here
that's
surely
the
case;
the
att
has
not
consented
to
class
arbitration.
then
california
law
says:
well,
that's
okay;
then
you
will
be
subject
to
a
class-action
suit
in
court.
but
the
very
purpose
of
the
arbitration
agreement
was
that
you
would
be
in
arbitration
and
not
in
court.
so
why
isn't
stolt-nielsen
dispositive
of
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here
you
have
an
unwilling
defendant
who
doesn't
want
class
arbitration.
