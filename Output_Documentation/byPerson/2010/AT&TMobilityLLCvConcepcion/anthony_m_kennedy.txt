justice

m.

but
it
seems
to
me
that
all
state
--
most
state
statutes
pertaining
to
contracts
pertain
to
a
class
that
is
not
entirely
universal.
suppose
the
state
had
a
statute
referring
to
banks,
contracts
with
banks.
that
doesn't
apply
to
all
contracts.
it
doesn't
apply
to
railroads.
but
we
know
that
it
applies
to
a
class
that
generally
includes
both
arbitration
and
non-arbitration.
and
that's
this
case,
because
there
can
be
class
action
rule
with
respect
to
litigation
and
class
action
rules
with
respect
to
arbitration.
so
you
have
to
have
some
rule
that
recognizes
that
you
don't
have
to
have
the
entire
universe
of
contracts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
your
test
is.
you
have
a
few
of
them
in
your
brief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
this
doesn't
have
what's
called
a
blowout
clause.
suppose
that
that
kind
of
clause
was
not
in
there.
and
the
consumer
opts
out
of
the
arbitration.
arbitration
doesn't
--
doesn't
go
well.
anyway,
can
the
consumer
then
insist
on
the
arbitration
that
the
consumer
bargained
for,
the
individual
arbitration
that
the
consumer
bargained
for?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
the
bank
has
to
have
--
liability
exposure
for
two
different
proceedings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
are
saying
then
california
can
say
it's
unconscionable
to
allow
the
parties
to
agree
that
there
will
be
just
the
single
arbitration
proceedings?
i
don't
see
how
the
third
parties
are
necessarily
protected.
if
you
say
that
the
consumer
still
has
the
election,
that
certainly
isn't
what
they
bargained
for.
maybe
i'm
--
maybe
that's
just
a
quarrel
with
the
content
of
the
unconscionability
standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
rather
than
faa,
but
i
think
it
does
bear
on
at
least
section
4
of
the
faa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
stick
with
the
theory
that
the
test
is
whether
or
not
the
law
in
question
is
inconsistent
with
the
idea
of
arbitration
--
whose
idea
of
arbitration?
what
about,
suppose
it's
the
bank's
idea
of
arbitration,
that
we
--
we
want
this
settlement,
say;
we
do
not
want
that;
that's
the
bank's
idea
of
arbitration
that
the
parties
agreed
on.
