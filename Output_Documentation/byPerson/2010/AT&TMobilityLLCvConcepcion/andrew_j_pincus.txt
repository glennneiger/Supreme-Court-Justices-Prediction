mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
in
this
case
that
a
state
law
may
mandate
the
use
of
a
particular
procedure
in
arbitration
as
long
as
the
law
also
requires
the
use
of
that
same
procedure
in
litigation.
that
interpretation
of
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
permit
a
state
to
oppose
in
arbitration
any
procedure
employed
in
court
and
thereby
require
arbitration
to
be
a
carbon
copy
of
litigation,
precisely
what
the
act
was
designed
to
prevent.
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
provides
that
an
arbitration
agreement
may
be
held
unenforceable
under
state
law
only
if
the
state
law
rule
being
invoked
to
invalidate
the
agreement
qualifies
as
a
ground
that
exists
in
law
or
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
respondent
argues
that,
because
california's
discover
bank
rule
does
not
facially
discriminate
against
arbitration,
it
falls
within
the
savings
clause.
but
the
plain
language
of
the
savings
clause
makes
clear
that
it
is
not
limited
to
statutes
that
discriminates
facially
against
arbitration.
by
referring
to
"any
contract",
it
makes
clear
that,
as
this
court
has
said,
the
rule
must
be
applicable
to
contracts
generally.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
can,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
the
legal
doctrine
that
the
state
is
applying
there,
as
states
have
and
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief,
is
a
doctrine
that
applies
a
general
principle
of
unconscionability
with
principles
elucidating
how
it
applies
that
apply
evenhandedly
across
the
board.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
if
it
wants
to
apply
a
lesser
standard
to
arbitration
clauses,
yes,
absolutely
you
can,
because
that
would
--
that
would
violate
what
is
at
the
core
of
the
provision,
which
is
discrimination
against
state
law.
if
a
state
--
if
a
state
enacted
--
if
the
legislature
enacted
a
statute
and
it
was
headed
arbitration
--
unconscionability,
rather,
and
section
1
of
that
statute
had
general
principles
to
be
applied
to
all
contractual
provisions
to
determine
unconscionability:
it
must
shock
the
conscience,
the
question
is
addressed
with
respect
to
the
party
before
the
court
against
whom
the
contract
is
going
to
be
applied,
and
the
third
principle
is
unconscionability
is
decided
ex
ante.
and
then
section
b
said
--
i'm
sorry?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
don't
think
so,
justice
sotomayor.
maybe
if
i
could
finish
with
my
example,
it
may
elucidate
the
distinction
that
i'm
trying
to
draw.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
the
critical
question
is:
is
the
state
applying
the
same
principles
to
arbitration,
of
unconscionability
to
arbitration
agreements,
as
to
other
agreements?
and
in
my
example
i
was
positing
a
first
provision
that
laid
out
three
principles
that
would
be
applied.
if
part
b
of
that
section,
or
part
2
of
that
section,
said
with
respect
to
arbitration
agreements,
on
the
other
hand,
we
are
going
to
require
that
the
procedures
be
equivalent
to
what
is
in
court,
we
are
going
to
look
at
the
time
the
dispute
arises
rather
than
ex
ante,
and
we
are
going
to
look
at
the
effect
on
everyone,
then
i
think
it
would
be
quite
clear
that
that
would
be
discrimination.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
respectfully,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
state
is
doing
here.
i
think
what
the
state
is
doing
here
is
saying
--
is
not
saying,
under
the
same
principles
we
apply
elsewhere,
this
is
unconscionable.
they're
just
saying,
it's
quite
clear
that
it's--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
they
haven't
said
that,
your
honor,
but
their
opinion
makes
clear
that
they
do.
for
example,
the
statute
in
california
that
defines
unconscionability
specifically
says
unconscionability
shall
be
assessed
at
the
time
of
contracting.
here,
the
decision
holding
the
discover
bank
rule
is
specifically
based
on
a
determination
of
unconscionability,
not
ex
ante,
when
there
would
be
a
variety
of
situations
to
consider,
but
it
is
explicitly
based
at
the
time
the
dispute
arose.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
so
it's
clear
that
they
are
applying
a
different--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--justice
kagan,
i
think
that
question
goes
to
--
to
a
separate
question.
i
think
respondent
has
two
arguments.
one
is,
because
this
rule
applies
to
all
dispute
resolution
provisions,
it
is
a
general
--
it
applies
to
any
contract
that
qualifies
under
section
2.
we
think
that
that
clearly
can't
be
the
case,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
section
2
says
"any
contract",
and
that,
the
court
has
said,
means
principles
that
apply
to
contracts
generally,
not
principles
that
are
limited
to
dispute
resolution
contracts.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
true,
your
honor.
but
if
the
provision
meant
that,
then
as
long
as
--
as
long
as
a
state
law
banning
arbitration
said,
we
are
banning
arbitration
in
any
contract,
then
the
state
could
say
it
applied
to
any
contract.
or
a
provision
that
said
juries
are
required
to
resolve
every
dispute,
whether
in
arbitration
or
not.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
we
--
we
do
make
an
argument,
your
honor,
that
the
impact
of
this
rule
is
much
more
significant
on
arbitration
than
it
is
on
litigation,
because
it
basically
--
with
respect
to
litigation,
it
is
reaffirming
the
default
rule,
but
with
respect
to
arbitration,
it
has
a
quite
significant
different
effect,
which
is
really
to
transform
arbitration
in
the
ways
that
the
court
described
in
stolt-nielsen.
and
so
we
do
argue
that
it
does
have
a
disproportionate
burden,
but
our
principal
argument
here
is
that
the
"any
contract"
requirement
means
that
the
state
law
rule
being
applied
has
to
be
a
rule
that
applies
generally
to
contractual
provisions,
as
the
court
has
said.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
that
--
that
now
turns
to
the
second
argument
that
respondents
make,
which
is,
even
if
the
mere
fact
that
it
applies
to
litigation
and
arbitration
satisfied
section
2,
the
rule
satisfied
--
satisfies
section
2
because
it
is
merely
a
specific
application
of
california's
general
unconscionability
rule.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
--
and
our
response
to
that
is:
it
is
quite
clear
that
in
three
critical
respects,
it
is
the
principles
that
were
applied
--
not
the
result,
but
the
principles
that
were
applied
in
order
to
find
unconscionability
here
--
are
different
than
the
principles
applied
in
every
other
context.
by
example--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
three
are,
first
of
all,
looking
to
the
effect
on
people
other
than
the
parties
to
the
dispute.
in
every
other
case--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
question
is:
is
it
fair
to
the
person
before
the
court
to
apply
the
contract
to
them?
here,
the
district
court
found
it
was
quite
fair
to
apply
to
that
person;
the
problem
was
third
parties.
the
second
issue:
when
is
the
unconscionability
decision
made?
as
i
said,
the
statute
says
ex
ante.
here,
the
decisions
explicitly
say:
we
are
going
to
look
at
it
at
the
time
the
dispute
arises.
third
question:
the
general
standard
is
shock
the
--
so
unfair
as
to
shock
the
conscience.
here
the
standard
is:
is
there
a
deterrent
effect
equivalent
to
a
judicial
class
action?
three
critical
differences,
three
differences
that
are
not
differences
in
result,
but
are
differences
in
the
legal
principles
that
are
being
applied
to
determine
unconscionability.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
and
the
only
--
as
i
said,
there
are
two
questions
in
this
case
and
i
think
it's
helpful
to
keep
them
separate.
one
is:
is
it
permissible,
simply
because
the
rule
applies
to
both
litigation
and
arbitration,
is
that
sufficient
to
satisfy--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
think
this
is
exactly
the
9,000-foot
meadow,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
problem
here
is
there
is
--
it
is
not
possible,
based
on
the
language
of
section
2
or
any
other
basis
that
we
can
think
of,
to
say
a
statute
that
requires
the
full
use
of
discovery
procedures
in
court
and
in
arbitration
or
factual
determinations
by
a
panel
of
six
individuals
selected
at
random--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
think
the
problem,
justice
ginsburg,
is
both
prongs
of
that
requirement
are
independently
problematic.
i
think,
for
the
reasons
that
i
was
just
saying
and
i
think
for
the
reasons
that
the
court
explained
in
stolt-nielsen,
requiring
class
arbitration
is
just
the
same
as
requiring
discovery
or
a
jury
trial
or
all
of
the
other
judicial
processes
in
arbitration.
and
if
the
alternative
prong
of
that
is
to
say,
well,
if
you
don't
do
that
you
must
exclude
these
claims
from
arbitration--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--is
independently--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--your
honor,
i
think
that's
the
precise
difference
between
the
two
issues
that
are
--
that
are
in
this
case.
for
the
reason
we
have
been
discussing,
we
think
there
is
a
very
strong
argument
that
a
rule
cannot
qualify
to
be
saved
under
section
2
simply
because
it
applies
even-handedly
to
arbitration
and
litigation
because
of
the
fact
that
that
would
sweep
in
all
of
these
other
rules
that
we
are
talking
about.
and
an
additional
reason,
to
respond
to
justice
breyer's
question,
is
that
at
the
time
that
the
faa
was
enacted
the
ouster
doctrine
did
apply
to
arbitration
litigation.
it
was
a
broad
doctrine
in
which
courts
said:
we
are
going
to
invalidate
any
contractual
provision
that
deprives
us
of
jurisdiction
whether
it
directs
the
claim
to
arbitration
or
it
directs
the
claim
to
some
other
court.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
so
the
very
same
argument
being
made
here
could
have
been
made
then.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
what
separates
the
two
is,
is
the
state
in
the
particular
case
in
which
the
determination
is
made
applying
principles
that
apply
to
--
across
--
that
apply
to
its
unconscionability
doctrine
across
the
board.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
but
i
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways,
justice
kagan.
first
of
all,
let
me
explain
why
the
hypotheticals
that
you
posit
and
that
justice
scalia
posited
and
that
justice
sotomayor
posited
have
been
addressed
under
the
traditional
unconscionability
doctrine
that
we
described.
in
all
of
those
cases,
what
courts
have
said
is
this
provision
--
we
are
measuring
whether
it
is
unconscionable
at
the
time
of
contracting;
we
are
looking
at
the
effect
on
the
party
before
the
court;
can
this
person
get
to
arbitration,
is
the
fee
too
high,
is
it
too
far
away.
what
about
--
we
are
looking
at
the
effect
on
this
particular
person
and
we
are
deciding
whether
it
shocks
the
conscience
or
whatever
their
across-the-board
state
standard
is.
and
in
all
of
those
cases,
that's
what
those
courts
do,
and
that's
why
those
provisions
have
been
invalidated,
because
they
are
invalidated
under
an
evenhanded
application
of
the
unconscionability
provisions
that
courts
apply
when
they
assess--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--sure.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that's
exactly
right,
justice
alito.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
it
is
not
the
state's
general
unconscionability
doctrine,
justice
kagan.
it
is
a
doctrine
that
applies
only
in
the
context
of
class
waivers
and
that's
the
problem.
if
the
state
were
to
adopt
a
general
statute
that
said,
for
unconscionability
purposes
henceforward
we
will
look
in
assessing
the
unconscionability
of
every
provision
at
third
parties,
at
the
impact
on
third
parties
and
whether
it's
fair
to
them,
perhaps
they
could
do
that.
i
think
there
might
be
some
reasons
why
a
state
wouldn't
do
that,
because
that
would
upset
a
lot
of
things
in
the
judicial
system
that
we
think
of
as
routine,
such
as
confidential
settlements
and
the
fact
that
arbitration
doesn't
require
publication
or
estoppel
and
all
kinds
of
rules
could
be
invalidated
on
that
ground.
but
at
least
it
would
be
an
even-handed
rule
that
the
state
applied
across
the
board,
and
it
would
also
apply
to
things
like
the
level
of
rent
in
rent
contracts
and
statutes
of
limitations
and
all
sorts
of
things.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
here,
that's
not
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
two
answers
to
that,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
they
haven't
done
it
generally
with
respect
to
contracts.
they
have
made
up
a
special
rule
that
is
targeted
on
a
special
kind
of
contract
and
that
carries
--
to
the
extent
one
is
worried
about
discrimination
--
nonfacial
discrimination
designing
the
category
of
contracts
relating
to
litigation
or
dispute
resolution
is
precisely
the
kind
of
category
that
most
presents
the
risk
of
discrimination
that
isn't
facial.
and
again,
whatever
any
contract
means,
we
think
it
has
to
mean
that
the
category
of
dispute
resolution
contracts
can't
be
one
that
satisfies
any
contract,
because
at
the
time
the
law
was
enacted
the
ouster
doctrine
did
just
that
and
it
was
the
doctrine
that
was
being
targeted.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
think
the
"any
contract"
language
of
the
statute
shows
that
congress
was
not
enacting
--
was
not
providing
that
everything
other
than
facial
discrimination
qualifies
for
the
savings
clause,
because
it
could
have
said
any
nondiscriminatory
rule.
it
said
a
rule
that
applies
to
any
contract.
and
the
reason
for
that
we
think
is
because
of
the
ouster
doctrine
it
was
confronted
with,
which
did
apply
to
both
arbitration
and
litigation
contracts,
and
because
of
the
risk
generally
that
a
contract
rule
could
be
devised
that
maybe
didn't
facially
discriminate
against
arbitration,
but
had
the
effect
of
targeting
arbitration
disproportionately
and
that's
what
is
going
on
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
most
--
most--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--in
most
of
the
examples
that
we
have
looked
at
of
situations
like
that,
the
contract
principles
that
are
being
applied
are
general
principles,
and
perhaps
they
are
being
applied
--
they
are
being
specified
for
four
particular
categories
of
contracts,
like
the
ucc,
but
they
are
tied
to
general
principles.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
--
but
i
think,
as
i
have
discussed,
the
problem
here
it
has
the
label
"unconscionability"
on
it,
but
the
test
that
is
applied
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
test
that
is
applied
in
every
other
context.
so
it's
an
easy
case
to
decide.
going
back
to
my
statutory
example,
this
is
an
unconscionability
--
this
is
a
test
that
may
have
the
label
on
it,
but
everything
that
the
court
looks
at
to
find
unconscionability
or
to
find
this
impermissible
are
things
that
are
not
looked
at
in
the
other
context.
and
in
the
other
context,
indeed
as
the
district
court
said,
this
contract
is
more
than
fair
under
our
general
unconscionability
standard,
because
it
--
the
people
before
the
court
are
better
off
than
they
would
be
in
a
class
action.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
what
the
court
has
to
do,
as
it
does
in
the
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
context
and
other
contexts,
is
to
determine
whether
the
state
is
--
is
applying
a
rule
that
is
--
that
discriminates,
because
the
core
protection
of
section
2
is
discrimination.
and
so,
if
the
--
if
the
state
has
devised
a
rule
that
clearly
discriminates,
but
has
simply
put
the
label
on
--
of
unconscionability,
surely
the
faa
permits
the
court
to
look
at
that.
otherwise
it's
--
the
protection
will
be
reduced
to
nothing.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
critical
question
here
--
are
there
other
cases
that
look
to
the
effect
on
the
party
before
the
court?
we
found
none
and
--
and
respondents
have
found
none.
are
there
other
case
that
assess
the
--
whether
it's
unconscionability
at
the
time
of
the
dispute
rather
than
at
the
time
of
contracting?
there
are
none.
the
statute
specifically
requires
it
to
be
done
at
the
time
of
contracting.
and
are
there
cases
that
say,
we
are
going
to
look
at
whether
something
is
--
not
whether
something
is
so
unfair
as
to
shock
the
conscience,
but
at
whether
it
is
the
equivalent
to
some
statutory
procedure?
and
that's
the
problem.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
although
we
believe
we
win
under
the
principle
of
obstacle
preemption
that
was
just
being
discussed
for
the
reasons
that
were
enunciated
in
stolt-nielsen,
we
think
there
is
a
much
easier
way
for
this
court
to
decide
this
case.
congress
when
it
wrote
section
2
used
the
phrase
"any
contract".
and
it
clearly
did
that
for
a
reason,
and
the
reason
was
it
wasn't
--
it
recognized,
as
justice
sotomayor
said,
that
there
could
be
attempts
through
nondiscriminatory
provisions
to
injure
arbitration;
and
the
protection
congress
adopted
was
a
prophylactic
rule.
it
said
if
the
state
law
rule
that
the
state
is
trying
to
apply
to
an
arbitration
clause
applies
broadly
to
a
large
set
of
clauses,
that's
the
best
protection
against
discrimination
and
that's
why
the
"any
contract"
language
is
there.
and
so,
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
sotomayor,
about
where
to
look
for,
for
what
"any
contract"
means,
we
think
it
means
very
broad;
and
the
court
has
said
that,
and
the
doctrines
that
the
court
has
identified
as
qualifying
--
duress,
fraud
and
unconscionability
--
are
doctrines
that
apply
broadly
across
the
entire
range
of
contract.
but
one
thing
that
is
very
clear,
we
think,
is
that
it
can't
mean
--
"any
contract"
can't
mean
any
dispute
resolution
contract,
because
that
is
the
gerrymandered
category
that
most
presents
the
risk
of
discrimination.
and
if
the
court
holds
that
that
category
is
impermissible
to
justify
a
rule,
it
deals
with
all
of
the
hypotheticals
that
are
being
discussed
because
they
are
all
jury
waivers,
discovery,
evidence;
those
are
all
rules
that,
as
the
court
has
propagated
as
hypotheticals,
are
rules
that
apply
to
all
dispute
resolution
clauses,
and
they
are
focused
on
dispute
resolution
clauses.
so
we
think
that
disposes
of
the
argument
that
discover
bank
can
be
applied,
simply
because
it
applies
to
litigation
contracts
and
arbitration
contracts.
the
next
question
is
respondents'
second
argument,
which
is
okay,
if
that
is
not
a
reason
it
falls
within
the
savings
clause,
it
falls
within
the
savings
clause
because
it's
simply
an
application
of
california's
general
unconscionability
doctrine.
and
that
is
where
we
turn
to
the
first
part
of
the
issues
i
was
discussing
in
the
issues
that
--
that
i
was
discussing
in
the
first
part
of
the
argument
with
the
court,
which
is
it
isn't,
because
in
the
three
particulars
that
i
listed,
it
is
clearly
a
totally
different
legal
rule
that
simply
has
the
unconscionability
label
on
it.
and
just
to
drill
down
on
my
colleague's
discussion
that
this
was
really
an
ex
ante
analysis.
it
couldn't
be
an
ex
ante
analysis,
because
that
would
have
to
take
into
account
that
the
vast
majority
of
claims
that
anyone
will
ever
have
under
a
contract
are
nonclassable
claims.
and
as
to
nonclassable
claims,
it's
clear
that
the
arbitration
process
is
infinitely
better
than
the
court
process,
because
for
most
small
consumer
claims
there
is
no
real
court
process.
and
so
if
one
were
to
make
an
ex
ante
assessment
of
the
fairness
for
the
parties
of
the
court,
it
wouldn't
just
be
about
classable
claims;
it
would
have
to
include
nonclassable
claims;
and
as
to
those
claims
it
is
clear
that
there
is
a
tremendous
benefit
to
those
people
from
the
arbitration
clause.
with
respect
to
exculpation,
my
friend
referred
to
the
california
rule
that
the
contract
has
to
have
a
public
effect.
that
is
not
about
effects
on
third
parties.
in
the
tunkl
case,
which
is
a
california
supreme
court
case
that
we
cite,
the
court
makes
clear
that
it's
looking
for
contracts
that
--
in
which
public
services
are
being
performed
and
that
are
otherwise
imbued
with
a
public
interest.
it's
not
looking
at
all
at
the
effects
on
third
parties.
finally,
my
colleague
spoke
about
lots
of
class
arbitrations.
to
our
knowledge
all
of
those
class
arbitrations
were
arbitrations
that
were
conducted
before
this
court's
decision
in
stolt-nielsen
where
a
party
had
a
silent
agreement
and
therefore
it
was
held
by
some
lower
courts
to
mean
that
class
arbitration
was
permissible.
we
are
not
aware
as
we
say
in
our
brief
of
any
contract
that
explicitly
permits
class
arbitrations
for
the
reasons
that
the
court
discussed.
it's
not
--
just
not
something
that
makes
any
sense.
thank
you.
