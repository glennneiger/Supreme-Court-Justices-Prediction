chief

john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
could
just
go
to
your
--
your
second
reason
seemed
to
be
focused
particularly
on
arbitration
as
opposed
to
a
principle
that
applies
to
every
other
contract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
the
substantive
state
liability
rule
on
the
issue
you
are
addressing
is
that
you
consider
the
issue
of
consent
ex
ante,
and
with
respect
to
arbitration
you
are
considering
it
at
the
time
the
dispute
arose.
isn't
that
a
discrimination
against
arbitration
agreements?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
sure.
that's
true
in
all
of
these
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
question
of
what
the
state
law
provides;
then
you
consider
whether
it's
consistent
with
the
federal
arbitration
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
other
area
of
contract
law
does
the
court
consider
unconscionability
not
with
respect
to
the
parties
before
the
court,
but
with
respect
to
third
parties?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
isn't
that
--
doesn't
that
look
to
the
parties
before
the
court
rather
than
third
parties?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
a
general
rule
of
contract
law
that
contracts
contrary
to
public
policy
could
be
unenforceable.
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
different
than
saying
we're
worried
about
third
parties
that
are
in
the
same
position
as
these
particular
parties.
in
other
words,
it's
not
simply
adverse
public
consequences,
but
it's
a
different
mode
of
analysis
than
i'm
familiar
with
under
basic
contract
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
do
you
get--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--where
do
you
get
"obvious
subterfuge"
in
the
federal
arbitration
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
in
the
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
context,
which
strikes
me
as
quite
different.
we
have
a
statute
here
that
says
the
arbitration
agreements
have
to
be
treated
like
any
other
contract,
any
contract.
i
don't
see
how
that's
the
same
as
obvious
subterfuge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
pincus,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
