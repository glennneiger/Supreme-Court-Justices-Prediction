justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
--
what
if
a
state
finds
it
unconscionable
to
have
an
arbitration
clause
in
an
adhesion
contract
which
requires
the
arbitration
to
be
held
at
a
great
distance
from
--
from
where
the
other
party
is
and
requires
that
party
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
arbitration?
can
a
state
not
find
that
to
be
unconscionable?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
wouldn't
apply
to
other
--
to
other
contracts.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
we
going
to
sit
in
judgment?
i
know
you
say
--
you
say
it
has
to
shock
the
conscience,
but
if
a
state
wants
to
apply
a
lesser
standard
of
unconscionability,
can
we
strike
that
down?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
how
do
you
address
justice
scalia's
--
if
you
are
saying
there
is
no
difference
between
those
two
things,
then
how
can
a
state
find
those
terms
unconscionable?
under
what
theory,
general
theory
of
law,
would
they
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
bad,
absolutely,
but
that's
not
what
the
state
is
going
to
do.
the
state
is
simply
going
to
say:
we
find
this
to
be
unconscionable.
and
you
say
it's
not
unconscionable;
it's
very
fair.
and
the
state
says:
eh,
we
think
it
is
unconscionable.
are
we
going
to
tell
the
state
of
california
what
it
has
to
consider
unconscionable?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
some
--
some
elements
of
unconscionability
can
only
arise
in
a
litigation
or
an
arbitration
context,
such
as
requiring
the
complaining
party
to
litigate
or
arbitrate
at
a
distant
location.
how
could
that
possibly
apply
in
--
to
any
other
contracts?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
three?
what
are
the
three?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
that.
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
how
do
you
have
special
rules
applicable
to
banks?
justice
antonin
scalia
contracts
by
banks,
can't
a
state
say,
you
know,
certain
bank
contracts
have
to
have
this
or
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
claim
that
here.
they
claim
it's
the
general
principle
of
unconscionability.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
the
question
is
not
whether
they
are
being
forced
to
accept
class
arbitration;
it's
whether
they
are
being
coerced
into
abandoning
regular
arbitration.
that's
really
the
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true,
as
long
as
those
impediments
are
removed
on
an
--
on
an
equal
footing
with
all
contracts.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
--
i
find
it
difficult
to
regard
as
--
voiding
exculpatory
contracts.
i
mean,
yes,
contracts
which
say
i'm
not
liable
if
--
even
though
i've
committed
a
wrong,
that's
exculpatory.
but
the
state
here
says,
you
have
to
not
only
be
liable
for
any
faults
that
the
other
party
to
this
contract
discovers,
but
the
other
party
of
this
contract
has
to
be
able
to
benefit
from
whatever
faults
anybody
else
in
the
world
might
find
and
bring
--
and
bring
a
class
action
lawsuit.
i
--
that
--
that
goes
well
beyond
forbidding
any
exculpatory
provisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondents
vincent
and
liza
concepcion
entered
into
a
contract
for
the
sale
and
servicing
of
cellular
telephones
with
the
petitioner
here,
at&t
mobility
llc.
the
contract
provided
that
all
disputes
between
the
parties
would
be
arbitrated
and
that
each
party
would
enter
arbitration
in
its
“individual
capacity,
and
not
as
a
plaintiff
or
class
member
in
any
purported
class
or
representative
proceeding."
the
contract
also
specified
that
at&t,
would
among
other
things,
bear
the
cost
of
arbitration
in
all
nonfrivolous
cases,
would
not
seek
reimbursement
of
its
attorney's
fees,
and
would
provide
a
minimum
award
of
$7,500
plus
double
attorney's
fees
to
any
customer
who
recovered
more
in
arbitration
than
at&t
had
offered
in
settlement.
in
march
2006,
the
concepcions
filed
a
complaint
against
at&t
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california.
that
complaint
was
later
consolidated
with
a
putative
class
action.
it
alleged
that
at&t
had
engaged
in
false
advertising
and
fraud
by
charging
sales
tax
on
phones
that
at&t
had
advertised
as
free
with
the
purchase
of
cellular
service.
at&t
moved
to
compel
arbitration
under
the
terms
of
its
contract,
but
the
district
court
denied
the
motion.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
it
held
that
the
arbitration
agreement
was
invalidated
by
a
california
law
which
said
that
class
waivers
in
consumer
arbitration
agreements
are
unconscionable
and
hence,
unenforceable
if
three
conditions
are
satisfied.
first,
the
agreement
is
in
an
adhesion
contract,
that
is
a
--
a
take
it
or
leave
it
contract
presented
by
a
party
in
a
strong
bargaining
position.
second,
disputes
between
the
parties
are
likely
to
involve
small
amounts
of
damages.
and
third,
the
party
with
inferior
bargaining
power
alleges
a
deliberate
scheme
to
defraud.
the
ninth
circuit
also
held,
and
this
is
the
federal
issue
that
brings
the
case
to
this
court,
that
the
california
law
did
not
run
a
foul
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
or
the
faa
which
makes
agreements
to
arbitrate,
“valid,
irrevocable,
and
enforceable,
save
upon
such
grounds
as
exist
at
law
or
in
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.”
“unconscionability,”
the
ninth
circuit
said,
“is
a
ground
for
revocation
of
any
contract.”
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
faa
was
enacted
in
1925
in
response
to
longstanding
judicial
hostility
to
agreements
to
arbitrate.
by
requiring
courts
to
hold
arbitration
agreements
"valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable,"
the
act
was
meant
to
preserve
for
agreed
upon
use,
a
procedure
that
provides
the
flexibility
necessary
to
develop
specialized
dispute
resolution
mechanisms.
we
have
held
that
parties
may
agree
to
limit
the
issues
subject
to
arbitration,
to
arbitrate
according
to
specific
rules,
and
to
limit
with
whom
they
will
arbitrate.
and
we
have
held
that
state
laws,
specifically
targeting
arbitration,
such
as
laws
prohibiting
the
arbitration
of
particular
types
of
claims
are
preempted.
although
the
faa
says
that
arbitration
agreements
can
be
held
unenforceable
on
grounds
that
exist
at
law
or
in
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
if
that
language
does
not
give
states
free
rein
to
adopt
the
policies
that
discriminate
against
arbitration
or
interfere
with
its
central
mechanics.
we
have
held
that
a
saving
clause
such
as
that
cannot
be
read
to
create
an
exception
so
large
that
it
swallows
the
whole
statute.
here,
to
allow
any
ground
of
unconscionability
that
is
generally
applied,
would
do
just
that.
nothing
would
stop
states
from
declaring
that
all
agreements
for
dispute
resolution,
whether
in
court,
in
mediation,
or
an
arbitration
are
unconscionable
unless
they
require
adherence
to
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
or
allow
judicially
monitored
discovery.
such
rules
would
destroy
arbitration
as
we
know
it,
which
is
what
the
faa
was
designed
to
preserve.
we
think
that
an
effective
requirement
of
classwide
consumer
arbitration
is
similar
to
those
examples
and
is
similarly
preempted.
we
held
in
stolt-nielsen
versus
animalfeeds
international
corporation
that,
“the
changes
brought
about
by
the
shift
from
bilateral
arbitration
to
class-action
arbitration
are
fundamental.”
classwide
arbitration
is
slower
and
procedurally
much
more
complicated
than
bilateral
arbitration.
in
court
litigation,
for
a
class-action
money
judgment
to
bind
absentee
class
member
--
members,
those
--
the
--
the
representatives
of
those
members
must
--
i'm
sorry.
the
representatives
of
those
members
must
at
all
times
adequately
represent
them.
the
absent
members
must
be
afforded
notice,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
a
right
to
opt
out
of
the
class.
at
least
this
amount
of
process
would
presumably
be
required
in
class
arbitration.
moreover,
the
aggregation
of
claims
in
class
arbitration
greatly
increases
the
stakes
for
the
defendant.
and
when
the
stakes
are
very
high,
the
informality
of
arbitration
becomes
much
less
appealing,
because
there
is
little
opportunity
for
judicial
review
to
correct
the
mistakes
that
informality
produces.
section
10
of
the
faa
allows
a
court
to
set
aside
an
arbitral
award
only
in
very
limited
circumstances,
essentially,
amounting
to
misconduct
by
the
arbitrator.
and
we
have
held
that
parties
may
not
contractually
expand
the
grounds
or
nature
of
judicial
review.
defendants
would
rarely
be
willing
to
bet
the
company
in
a
class
arbitration
proceeding
with
no
effective
means
of
review.
given
these
considerations,
the
california
law
in
question
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
faa,
it
is
accordingly
preempted.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
--
justices
ginsburg,
sotomayor
and
kagan
have
joined.
