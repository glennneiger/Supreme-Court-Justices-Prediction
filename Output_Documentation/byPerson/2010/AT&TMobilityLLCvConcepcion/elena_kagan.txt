justice
elena
kagan
--i
was
under
the
impression,
mr.
pincus,
that
discover
bank
specifically
cites
a
case
which
arose
not
in
the
arbitration
context,
but
instead
in
the
general
litigation
context,
which
is
this
america
online
case,
and
thereby
made
clear
that
its
rule,
however
different
it
may
seem
to
you
from
normal
contract
provisions,
its
rule
applied
both
in
the
arbitration
sphere
and
in
the
litigation
sphere.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
this--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
mr.
pincus--
justice
elena
kagan
--but,
mr.
pincus,
i'm
not
understanding
what
test
you
are
asking
us
to
formulate.
justice
scalia
started
this
by
saying,
how
about
a
provision
prohibiting
certain
kinds
of
attorney's
fees?
how
about
a
provision
prohibiting
certain
kinds
of
--
a
law
prohibiting
certain
kinds
of
discovery
provisions?
and
you
said
that
would
be
fine,
for
the
state
courts
to
hold
those
things
unconscionable,
but
it's
not
fine
for
the
state
court
to
hold
a
class
arbitration
prohibition
unconscionable.
so
what
separates
the
two?
how
do
we
know
when
something
is
on
one
side
of
the
line
and
something
is
on
the
other?
both
procedures,
but
you
say
some
are
fine,
to
say
that
those
procedures
are
unconscionable,
but
other
procedures
if
you
held
them
unconscionable
that
would
not
be
sufficient.
justice
elena
kagan
the
state
says
yes.
justice
elena
kagan
the
state
says
it
absolutely
is.
now,
who
are
we
to
say
that
the
state
is
wrong
about
that.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
pincus,
the
state
says,
well,
our
unconscionability
doctrine
may
not
have
done
that
in
the
past,
but
now
in
the
year
2010
it
actually
applies
to
more
things
than
it
did
in
the
past,
and
we
do
take
into
account
third
parties
and
that's
our
new
unconscionability
doctrine.
now,
it
may
be
a
good
unconscionability
doctrine
or
it
may
be
a
bad
unconscionability
doctrine,
but
it's
the
state's
unconscionability
doctrine.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
gupta,
at&t
says
that
nobody
would
ever
choose
class
arbitration;
it's
the
worst
of
both
worlds.
you
get
all
the
procedures,
you
get
broad
liability,
but
at
the
same
time
you
have
no
judicial
review,
so
that
this
will
effectively
kill
off
arbitration
in
the
consumer
context.
justice
elena
kagan
is
your
test
a
purpose
test
or
an
effects
test?
is
it
a
test
that
says
the
state
is
doing
this
in
order
to
kill
arbitration,
or
is
it
a
test
that
says
the
state
is
doing
something
that
will
kill
arbitration?
