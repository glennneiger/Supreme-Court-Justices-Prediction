justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
discover
bank
is
the
california
case
that
sets
it
out;
is
that
correct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
california
law.
and
what
they
say
in
discover
bank
is
--
they
are
talking
about
class
waivers
in
both
arbitration
contracts
and
not
arbitration
contracts.
and
they
say
they
are
void
when
it's
a
consumer
contract
of
adhesion,
when
they
predictably
involve
small
amounts
of
damages,
when
it
is
claimed
that
the
party
with
the
superior
bargaining
power
has
carried
out
a
scheme
deliberately
to
cheat
large
numbers
of
consumers
out
of
individually
small
sums
of
money,
and
the
waiver
becomes
in
practice
the
exemption
of
the
party
from
responsibility
for
its
own
fraud.
now,
seems
to
--
those
seem
to
be
the
principles
that
apply.
those
principles
apply
to
litigation.
they
apply
to
arbitration.
what's
the
problem?
they
don't
say
anything
there
about
the
things
you
mention.
they
just
mention
four
things,
which
i
just
read.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
would
guess
it's
like
switzerland
having
a
law
saying,
we
only
buy
milk
from
cows
who
are
in
pastures
higher
than
9,000
feet.
that
discriminates
against
milk
from
the
rest
of
the
continent.
but
to
say
we
want
cows
that
have
passed
the
tuberculin
test
doesn't.
so
i
guess
we
have
to
look
at
the
particular
case.
and
here,
my
impression
is
--
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
--
the
class
arbitration
exists.
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
like
having
a
jury
trial.
you
could
have
it
in
arbitration.
you
can
have
it
in
litigation.
so
where
is
the
9,000-foot
cow,
or
whatever
it
is?
where
is
the
discrimination?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
why,
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
that's
i
think
what
justice
kagan
is
getting
at.
if
a
state
wants
to
have
a
doctrine
which
says,
you
have
to
have
a
seal
of
a
certain
kind
on
certain
kinds
of
contracts,
they've
never
done
it
before,
but
now
they
do
it,
and
on
that
kind
you
have
to
have
a
seal
both
on
the
arbitration
contract
and
on
the
other.
and
here
what
they've
done
is
they
have
listed
the
four
characteristics
from
discover
bank,
and
they've
said
all
contracts
to
do
with
litigation
have
to
satisfy
those
four.
at
which
point
i
think
justice
kagan
said,
so
what
if
they've
never
done
this
before?
they
sure
have
done
it
now.
and
what's
the
basis
for
saying
that
the
arbitration
act
or
any
other
part
of
federal
law
forbids
california
from
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
brother
says
that
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
have
to
--
you
would
do
it
differently,
because
they
might
be
telling
the
truth.
the
example
that
your
brother
lawyer
gave
is
this:
that
we
have
a
state
and
the
state
says,
if
you
have
a
contract,
in
the
dispute
resolution
provision,
whether
you
have
arbitration
or
not,
that
provision
is
void
if
it
says
you
won't
have
a
judge,
and
it's
void
if
it
says
you
won't
have
a
jury,
and
it's
void
if
it
says
that
you
will
not
go
to
the
united
states
courthouse
for
deciding
all
federal
claims.
that
applies
whether
there
is
an
arbitration
clause
or
not
an
arbitration
clause.
now,
that
would
seem
to
me
no
subterfuge.
it
is
absolutely
clear.
they
are
not
lying.
it
just
happens
to
prevent
arbitration.
and
he
says
that's
absolutely
true
of
this
one,
that
once
you
get
into
class
actions
you
will
discover
you
have
something
that
really
looks
like
a
court
case.
you
have
to
have
discovery,
you
have
dozens
of
lawyers
involved,
you
have
depositions,
you
are
running
off
every
5
minutes
to
the
judge
or
to
somebody
to
say
is
this
deposition
good,
bad
or
indifferent.
you
have
methods
for
enforcing
the
deposition.
you
have
all
kinds
of
things.
he
can
make
a
much
bigger
list
than
me.
so
he
says:
this
case
is
like
the
case
of
california
saying
everybody
can
decide
it
any
way
they
want
as
long
as
they
do
it
before
a
federal
judge.
okay?
now
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what's
your
answer
to
his
specific
effort
to
assimilate
the
issue
in
this
case,
which
is
the
class
action,
to
the
made-up
issue,
which
you
concede
is
a
discrimination?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
--
what
about
a
rule
that
says
what
you
have
to
have
in
any
contract
is
a
rule
that
all
the
rules
of
the
federal
civil
procedure
apply
to
discovery,
not
necessarily
in
a
courtroom,
but
you
have
to
follow
exactly
those
procedures?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
why
isn't
this
obstacle
preemption?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
do
we
look
to
find
the
answer?
i
mean,
i
understand
your
answer
and
i
know
the
other
side's
going
to
say:
well,
this
is
a
tremendous
obstacle.
if
i
have
one
person
to
deal
with,
i
say:
you
want
your
$75,
i
will
offer
you
$75,
and
if
you
don't
take
it
and
i
turn
out
to
be
wrong,
i'm
going
to
give
you
$7,500.
that's
their
system.
right?
so
they
say
the
alternative
is
class
action.
there
are
a
million
customers.
i'm
faced
with
a
claim
for
$75
million.
i
can't
afford
that.
i'll
settle
it,
even
if
i'm
right.
so
if
you
have
your
rule,
i'm
going
to
be
facing
these
things
all
the
time.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
going
to
enter
into
arbitration
agreements.
i
will
take
my
chances
in
court.
okay?
now,
that
--
that's
their
argument.
so
it
is
empirical,
in
part:
what
do
i
look
to?
it's
not
logic.
it's
a
question
of
where
should
i
--
what
should
i
read
to
show,
in
your
opinion,
you're
right?
