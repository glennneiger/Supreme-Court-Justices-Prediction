justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
that
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
complete
answer.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i
thought
that
was
the
gist
of
your
argument,
the
heart
of
your
argument,
that
traditional
unconscionability
in
california
and
elsewhere
focuses
on
unfairness
to
the
party
who
is
before
the
tribunal.
so
here
it
would
be
unfairness
to
the
concepcions,
rather
than
unfairness
to
other
members
of
the
class
who
are
not
before
the
court.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
maybe
you
can
explain
it
this
way.
compare
what
the
concepcions
have
available
to
them
under
the
contract
with
what
going
through
the
arbitration,
all
the
procedures
leading
up
to
arbitration
and
arbitration,
against
what
they
would
get
at
best
if
this
were
allowed
to
proceed
on
a
class
basis.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
--
why
are
they
better
off
with
a
--
with
a
class
adjudication?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
--
and
isn't
that
what
distinguishes
this
from
the
ordinary
unconscionability
analysis?
if
the
district
court
correctly
understood
the
way
the
at&t
mobility
scheme
works
and
--
and
the
district
court
said
that
under
the
revised
arbitration
provision
nearly
all
consumers
who
purchase
the
informal
--
who
pursue,
i'm
sorry,
the
informal
claims
process,
are
very
likely
to
be
compensated
promptly
and
in
full,
etcetera,
etcetera.
if
the
district
court
understood
that
correctly,
the
scheme
here
was
--
is
found
to
be
unconscionable
because
it
doesn't
allow
the
enlistment
of
basically
private
attorneys
general
to
enforce
--
to
enforce
the
law.
and
isn't
that
quite
different
from
ordinary
unconscionability
analysis?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
take
you
back
to
a
question
that
was
asked
a
few
minutes
ago,
because
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
answer.
what
is
the
difference
between
a
state
rule
that
says
that
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
must
be
followed
in
any
adjudication
and
a
rule
that
says
that
class
adjudication
must
always
be
available?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
uh-huh.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i
just
--
i'm
not
putting
this
under
an
unconscionability
label.
these
are
just
general
rules,
and
the
question
is
whether
they
--
whether
they
can
be
applied,
whether
they
constitute
discrimination
against
--
against
arbitration.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
i
really
would
appreciate
it
if
you
would
answer
my
hypothetical
on
one
that
was
posed
before.
what
is
the
difference
--
let
me
change
it
slightly
--
between
a
rule
that
says
you
must
follow
the
rules
of
evidence
in
every
adjudication
and
a
rule
that
says
that
class
adjudication
must
always
be
available?
i
think
your
answer
comes
down
to
the
proposition
that
the
former
is
inconsistent
with
the
idea
of
arbitration,
and
therefore,
that's
why
it's
not
allowed,
and
the
latter
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
idea
of
arbitration,
and
therefore,
it
is
allowed.
is
that
correct
or
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
okay.
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing.
insisting
on
compliance
with
the
federal
--
with
the
california
rules
of
evidence
is
an
obstacle
to
arbitration,
but
allowing
--
insisting
on
the
availability
of
class
adjudication
is
not
an
obstacle
to
arbitration.
but
in
the
end--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--we
have
to
make
a
value
judgment
about
whether
these
things,
one
thing
or
the
other,
fits
with
arbitration.
that's
what
it
comes
down
to.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
when
it
--
when
it
imposes
the
rule
that
the
--
the
rules
of
evidence
apply
across
the
board,
it
says
it
feels
that
these
are
necessary
in
order
for
parties
to
be
treated
fairly
in
every
method
of
adjudication.
