i
have
this
--
this
question
about
due
process:
the
components
of
the
due
process
analysis,
it
seems
to
me,
are
what
is
reasonable,
what's
necessary
in
the
case,
what's
unconscionable.
that
it
seems
to
me
is
just
an
extrapolation
of
what
reynolds
said,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
don't
have
that
just
as
a
law
of
--
of
the
federal
common
law
of
contracts.
i
don't
know
why
we
need
to
elevate
this
to
a
due
process
analysis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assuming
that
we're
--
we
apply
reynolds,
which--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
--
that
just
restates
the
question
of
what
--
what
do
you
do
if
you
apply
the
reynolds
principle
to
this
case,
and
they
would
say,
well,
you
could
have
put
it
in
your
contract,
too,
and
i
think
that's
almost
a
wash.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
can
--
we
can
do
it
as
a
member
--
as
a
matter
of
the
law
of
contracts.
and
when
we
look
at
the
law
of
contracts
in
reynolds,
reynolds
talked
about
the
moving
party,
and
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that
phrase
either
had
or
has
really
definable
content
in
our
law.
it
seems
to
me
it's
just
a
question
of
the
burden
of
persuasion.
at
one
point,
the
contractor
has
to
proceed.
he
makes
--
it
makes
a
certain
showing,
and
the
government
has
to
go
back
and
forth.
and
if
at
some
point,
the
person
with
the
burden
of
persuasion
invokes
the
privilege,
then
we
have
to
ask
whether
it's
fundamentally
fair
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
law
of
contracts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
contract--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
the
contract
contain
the
term
"moving
party"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
the
whole
law
of
contracts
you
could
say,
oh,
the
contracting
parties
could
have
put
this
down,
anticipatory
breach,
we
don't
need
to
have
rules
on
that,
the
parties
could
have
negotiated.
that's
not
the
way
contract
law
works.
