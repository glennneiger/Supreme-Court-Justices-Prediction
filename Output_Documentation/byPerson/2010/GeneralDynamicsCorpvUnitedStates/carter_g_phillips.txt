mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
proposition
that
petitioners
are
here
challenging
is
the
one
adopted
or
embraced
by
the
federal
circuit
that
says
that
the
united
states
government
can
declare
that
certain
of
its
government
contracting
partners
have
operated
in
default
and
under
those
circumstances
can
reach
into
the
government
contractor's
pocket,
withdraw
at
the
time
$1.35
billion
of
monies
that
were
spent
by
the
united
states,
but
for
services
that
were
rendered,
without
question,
pursuant
to
the
contract,
pursuant
to
the
instructions
of
the
united
states
government,
and
that
when
the
contractor
seeks
to
defend
against
the
claim
that
it
has
engaged
in
some
kind
of
default
conduct,
that
the
government
can
assert
the
state-secrets
privilege
and
in
so
doing
deprive
the
contractor
of
the
ability
effectively
to
respond
to
the
government's
conclusion.
under
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statement
in
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
reynolds,
which
is
that
the
government
is
certainly
free
to
assert
the
state-secrets
privilege,
but
when
it
does
so
it
has
to
assume
certain
responsibilities
that
come
from
it,
at
least
in
the
circumstances
where
the
united
states
is
the
moving
party.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
was
nothing
specific
with
respect
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
time
the
contractors
identified
the
superior
knowledge
problem
arose,
obviously,
when
the
government
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
issuing
a
cure
notice,
because
up
until
that
point,
obviously,
the
parties
are
attempting
to
negotiate
and
work
to
a
final
resolution
of
this
project,
as
you
would
hope
any
contracting
entities
would,
to
bring
the
contract
to
a
happy
resolution,
so--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
you
have
to
put
it
in
context,
justice
ginsburg,
because
during
this
period
of
time,
obviously,
there
were
consistent
efforts
and
requests
being
made
to
get
access
to
both
the
b-2
and
the
a-117
stealth
technologies,
and
there
were
discussions
that
went
back
and
forth,
and
the
district
court
--
and
the
court
of
federal
claims
specifically
held,
eventually
the
information
was
forthcoming,
but
it
was,
candidly,
too
little
and
too
late
to
effectively
allow
the
contract
to
proceed
as
--
as
planned.
so
i
think
--
i
mean,
i
agree,
you
know,
in
a
perfect
world,
maybe
you
would
have
identified
this.
but
in
this
situation,
the
parties
are
simply
trying
to
come
to
some
kind
of
a
resolution
that
allows
both
sides
to
be
satisfied
by
the
final--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--disposition.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
think
--
i
think,
justice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
you
have
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
and
we
would
have
been
perfectly
content
to
proceed
with
the
evidence
we
had.
but
the
ultimate
decision
by
the
court
of
federal
claims
was
that
it
was
impossible
to
ultimately
be
in
a
position
to
resolve
it.
but
i
want
to
answer
your
more
fundamental
question,
your
honor
as
to
the
--
the
basic
point
is
that
the
background
principle
of
law,
the
superior
knowledge
defense,
is
the
understanding
of
the
parties
when
they
enter
into
an
agreement.
i
mean,
that
would
have
been
true
just
as
much
in
the
helene
curtis
case
and
the
other
cases
where
the
federal
circuit
has
acknowledged
the
superior
knowledge
defense.
that's
been
around
for
a
long
time.
it's
an
understood
basis
on
which
the
parties
enter
into
an
agreement.
that's
the
first
answer.
the
second
answer
is
that
you're
asking
us
to
put
into
a
contract
something
about
information
that
we
don't
know
anything
about.
i
mean,
we
have
some
sense
about
the
b-2
and
the
a-117,
but
we
don't
know
anything
about
the
other
programs
that
are
identified
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
our
claim
--
we
have
separate
--
we
have
a
series
of
distinct
claims.
our
first
claim
is
that
we
never
would
have
entered
into
the
contract
in
the
first
place
if
the
government
had
provided
us
with
information
based
on
its
superior
knowledge
that,
for
instance,
the
weight
specifics
that
we
were
being
asked
to
provide
or
to
supply
were
literally
impossible
to
comply
with
based
on
what
the
government
already
knew.
if
we
had
been
just
told
that
much,
just
given
a
warning,
we
wouldn't
be
in
the
situation
where
we
are
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well
--
i
mean,
there
may
be
a
factual
dispute,
but
i'd
be
--
and
i
would
be
happy
to
litigate
that
issue
if
we
can
get
to
that
point
where
we
are
in
fact
allowed
to
litigate
any
aspects
of
our
particular
defense.
but
the
bottom
line
here
is,
and
again
to
state
the
proposition
as
starkly
as
it
is
because
this
is
the
way
it
comes
to
the
court
from
the
federal
circuit,
they're
saying
that
the
government
can
assert
a
claim
for
$1.35
billion
dollars
against
us
and
tell
us
that
we
cannot
defend
against
that
claim
even
though
the
reason
why
we
were
unable
to
comply
with
the
contract
is
because
of
the
fact
that
the
government
didn't
provide
us
information
either
at
the
outset
or
as
we
went
along--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--can
i
just--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
well,
it
seems
to
me
clearly
that
this
is
the
precise
situation
where
reynolds
is
saying
if
you
cannot
bring
forward
a
legitimate
defense
--
i
mean,
part
of
the
problem
is
we
don't
know
precisely
what
information
we
didn't
have
and
were
never
entitled
to.
so
it's
very
difficult
to
say
how
strong
is
our
defense
under
these
circumstances.
what
we
do
know
is
that
the
court
of
federal
claims
judge
looked
very
carefully
at
this
and
said
that
we
had
made
an
impressive
showing
without
regard
to
any
of
the
confidential
or
privileged
information
of
a
prima
facie
defense
in
these
circumstances.
so
our
position
is
we
had
a
very
valid
defense.
this
is
not
pretextual.
we're
not
throwing
this
in
simply
as
a
mechanism
to
force
the
government
to
assert
its
state
secrets.
that's
a
fairly
contrived
approach
to
litigation,
and
frankly
not
something
that
i
could
imagine
any
circumstance
in
which
we
would
do
that.
two,
i
don't
see
how
this
throws
a
monkey
wrench
into
this
process
whatsoever,
much
less
throws
out
the
monkey,
because
the
basic
understanding
here
is
that
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
force
its
contractor
down
a
ruinous
course.
if
the
government
has
information
available
to
it,
then
it
has
to
make
that
information
--
has
to
be
forthcoming
with
the
information
with
the
contractor,
either
at
the
outset,
which
would
have
been
the
best
of
all
circumstances
here,
or
as
matters
go
along.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
"moving
party"
i
think
is,
is
not
a
self-defined
concept,
justice
alito.
the
petitioners
are
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
the
review
scheme
also
says
that
the
very
--
in
1986
in
the
assurance
case,
the
federal
circuit
said,
which
was
before
this
contract
was
entered
into,
the
federal
circuit
said
the
filing,
the
mere
filing
of
a
complaint,
immediately
vacates
the
contracting
officer's
rule.
so
our
understanding
at
the
time
we
entered
into
this
agreement
is
that
if
there
were
a
problem
with
the
way
the
contracting
officer
operated,
we
would
be
allowed
to
file
a
claim
and
immediately
take
the
contracting
officer's
rule
off
the
table.
under
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
all
we're
asking
for
is
to
go
back
to
the
status
quo
ante
in
that
situation,
which
means
there's
no
contracting
officer
decision,
there's
no
basis
on
which
the
government
can
make
a
claim
for
1.35
billion,
now
$3
billion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
what
had
not
happened
is
that
the
final
--
there
had
not
been
a
final
sign-off
by
the
contracting
officer
approving
it,
and
thereby
reducing
it
to
a
liquidated
claim.
but
that's
a
vastly
different
statement
than
to
say
--
and,
indeed,
we
have
an
argument
that,
at
least
with
respect
to
half
of
that,
that
it
had
already
effectively
been
approved
through
a
mechanism
independent
of
the
contracting
officer.
but
the
bottom
line
here
is
these
were
services
rendered,
actually
rendered.
this
was
not
some
kind
of
a
prepayment
for
services
to
be
rendered
in
the
future.
that's
not
the
nature
of
this
contract.
these
were
--
this
was
for
work
we
had
done,
for
which
we
had
submitted
specific
claims,
and
for
which
the
contracting
officer
had
pending
before
him
at
the
time.
and
so,
you
know,
what
the
government
says
is
that
--
is
that
it
was
a
payment
and
they
didn't
ultimately
get
the
airplanes
that
were
the
ultimate
desire
of
the
contract
under
these
circumstances,
and
that's
obviously
true
because
they
terminated
the
contract
a
year
before
the
airplanes
were
due
to
be
provided
to
them.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
no
justice
ginsburg,
that's
not
true.
all
we
are
asking
for
is
--
are
the
remedies
that
are
fully
available
if
you
were
to
convert
this
from
a
termination
for
default
into
a
termination
for
convenience,
and
under
those
circumstances,
what
--
you
know,
the
government
has
a
wonderful
mechanism
there
that
protects
it
against
the
kind
of
lost
profits
damages
that
might
otherwise
be
available
in
a
situation
where
you
have
a
more
traditional
breach
of
contract.
so
all
we're
asking
for
is
the
actual
amount
of
money
that
we
expended,
that
frankly
the
court
of
federal
claims
explicitly
found,
and
at
this
stage
it's
unchallenged,
although
presumably
it
might
be
litigable
at
some
point,
but
that
these
were
all
reasonable,
allowable,
and
fairly
allocable
costs
to
these
--
to
this
particular
contract.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
alito,
i
think
that
is
precisely
how
you
ought
to
look
at
it,
and
--
and
we
would
be
very
comfortable
with
that,
because
it's
quite
clear
to
me
that,
except
in
the
hyper-technical
way
that
--
that
you
articulate
because
of
--
because
of
the
way
the
contracts
disputes
act
plays
out,
that
the
government
is
unquestionably
the
moving
party,
the
party
seeking
affirmative
relief
to
be
able
to
take
1.35
billion--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
in
that
--
i
mean,
you
can
--
that's
one
way
to
articulate
it.
i
think
the
other
way
to
articulate
it,
which
--
which
is
much
more
consistent
with
the
reality
of
what's
going
on
here,
is
that
the
government
is
making
a
claim
for
$1.35
billion
for
which
--
on
the
basis
that
we
did
not
act
in
a
timely
fashion.
and
that's
the
only
basis
that
exists
in
this
litigation
any
more,
is
just
the
time
of
the
actions
that
we
took.
and
our
answer
to
that
claim
is
to
say:
no,
we
--
we
--
we
are
not
at
fault
for
the
delays
because
you
did
not
provide
us
the
information
or
you
did
not
spare
us
the
burden
of
having
to
go
down
this
path
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
but
that
just
goes
to
justice
alito's
question
about
is
there
some
way
to
evaluate
those
claims
separately,
and
the
answer
is,
yes,
they
should
be
evaluated
separately.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
to
be
sure,
we
would
be
much
more
comfortable
in
the
world
you
just
articulated,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
with
interest.
[laughter]
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
starting
to
add
up,
your
honor.
[laughter]
but
--
and
--
certainly
we
think
that's
--
that
is
the
minimum
that
we
should
be
entitled
to,
and
maybe
to
some
extent
you
could
say
we're
sort
of
being
a
little
greedy.
but
the
--
the
reality
is
that
the
standard
rule
is
that
if
you
take
a
contract
and
you
say
you
cannot
make
a
determination
that
the
contractor
has
been
guilty
of
default,
then
that
contract
should
be,
in
the
kind
of
the
basic
contract
law
and
it's
also
in
this
--
in
this
agreement,
that
you
--
you
convert
it
to
a
termination
for
convenience.
and
then
the
question
simply
is,
what
rights
flow
from
having
declared
this
to
be
a
termination
for
convenience?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
that
--
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
no.
i
mean,
actually,
what
--
what
the
$1.2
billion
was,
was
the
additional
amounts
of
money
that
were
actually
expended
by
the
contractors
that
were
reasonable,
allocable
and
allowable,
by
and
according
to
the
court
of
federal
claims,
on
this
agreement.
so,
there
--
and
it
would
be
the
standard
operating
procedure.
if
you
have
a
termination
for
convenience,
where
the
government
says,
look,
we've
decided
we
just
don't
want
to
have
this,
we
don't
want
these
airplanes
any
more,
so
let's
just
call
it
off,
which
the
government
has
the
right
to
do,
then
the
question
is
what
are
the
reasonable
costs
that
are,
you
know,
sort
of
reallocated
as
a
consequence
of
that.
and
the
court
of
federal
claims--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
seems
to
me
the
--
i
mean,
the
question
is
was
the
default--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
and
the
question
is,
if
you
call
the
game
off,
what
--
what
flows
from
that.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
--
you
can
say
we'll
let
the
government
call
it
a
default,
i
suppose,
or
you
could
just
as
easily
say,
and
obviously
the
position
we
would
take
is,
you
say
the
government
cannot
call
it
a
default
because
in
order
to
get
some
kind
of
a
determination
along
those
lines
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
judgment
that's
not
an
honest
assessment
of
the,
of
the
--
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
and,
so,
if
you
say
it's
not
a
default
termination,
then
there
is
just
a
certain
amount
of
--
certain
consequences
that
flow
from
converting
it,
and
it
automatically
converts
at
that
point
to
a
termination
for
convenience.
and
in
a
termination
for
convenience
situation,
then
you
reallocate
the
costs
in
precisely
the
way
that
the
court
of
federal
claims
has
done
this
at
this
point.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
the
question
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
--
i
--
the
problem--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
well,
i
would
think
that
the
--
the
more
appropriate
way
to
proceed
under
those
circumstances,
given
that
a
default
termination
carries
with
it
a
lot
of
collateral
consequences,
it
exposes
you
to
subsequent
problems
in
the
contracting
context,
it
creates
the
possibility
of
debarment
in
--
in
future
proceedings,
that
rather
than
allow
a
finding
that
no
one
can
comfortably
conclude
is
the
right
finding
to
stay
in
place
and
have
those
collateral
consequences
flow
from
it,
the
more
appropriate
way
to
proceed
would
be
to
say:
look,
i
can't
make
a
determination
in
this
case
that
there
should
be
a
termination
for
default.
and
under
those
--
and
so
therefore,
the
--
the
--
under
the
contract,
under
the
government
contracting
principles
generally,
it
automatically
converts
over
to
a
termination
for
convenience.
and
once
that
happens,
then
you
go
down
the
road
of
--
of
evaluating
those
costs.
and,
again,
the
government
has
arguments
about
those
costs,
i'm
sure,
and
we
can
--
and
we
can
debate
those
out,
although,
you
know,
i
would
commend
the
court
to
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
i
--
i
said--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
could
be
characterized
that
way.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
now,
are
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
but
--
well,
i
don't
know
whether
you
want
me
to
answer
the
second
part
first--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--or
go
back
to
the
original
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure,
and
so
could
the
government.
i
mean,
the
reality
is
that
the
background
principle
here
is
united
states
v.
reynolds.
and
united
states
v.
reynolds
says
that
if
somebody
is
the
moving
party,
that
is
the
party
seeking
affirmative
relief,
that's
the
party
who's
going
to
bear
the
burden--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
--
i
think
that
actually
the
court
in
reynolds,
to
the
extent
it
would
have
envisioned
any
of
these
circumstances
decades
ago,
used
the
language
"moving
party"
rather
than
"plaintiff"
or
"defendant"
precisely
for
that
reason,
because
i
think
what
the
court
had
in
mind
is
the
party
who
was
seeking
affirmative
relief.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
no.
to
be
sure,
that's
--
that's
the
specific
context,
although
the
court's
language
is
broader
than
that.
it
just
didn't
talk
about
itself
as
a
defendant
in
a
tort
action.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
in
the
one
situation
i
have
$1.35
billion
in
my
pocket
for
services
that
were
unquestionably
rendered
and
which,
in
our
judgment,
you
know,
satisfied
our
portion
of
the
obligation
under
this
contract.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
justice
kagan.
i
think
the
bottom
line,
though,
is,
you
know,
what
--
what
--
what
are
--
what
do
principles
of
fundamental
fairness
tell
you
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean,
the
very
fact
that
the
court
says
and
limits
its
ruling
to
where
the
government
is
not
the
moving
party,
i
mean
if
the
government
really
--
if
the
court--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
--
right.
well,
no,
you
should
clearly
read
the
court
of
federal
claims
opinion
that
gave
rise
to
this
in
the
first
place,
where
--
where
the
judge
says,
we
have
made--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--an
impressive
prima
facie
showing
of
a
defense.
and
--
and
the
federal
circuit's
view
is:
we
don't
care;
we're
not
going
to
let
you
go
down
that
path,
period.
and
all
we're
saying
is
that
in
that
situation,
where
we
have
made
that
kind
of
showing,
the
default
rule
should
be
the
government
cannot
reach
into
our
pocket
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
the
nonprivileged
information
that
it
had
available
to
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
recognized
that
it
terminated
the
discovery
early;
and
actually,
it
did
--
it
terminated
discovery
very
early,
and
--
and
there
are
whole
programs
that
we
know
nothing
about.
we
know
about
the
b-2
and
the
a-15.
what
we
don't
know
are
the
other
programs,
and
there's
nothing
in
this
record
on
any
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
this
case
can
properly
be
decided
on
federal
common
law
principles,
and
indeed
i
would
ask
the
court
to
apply
those
same
--
those
contract
principles
in
this
context
to
--
it's
just
on
the
joint
appendix
on
page
209.
general
katyal
focuses
on
what
happens
when
the
contracting
officer
takes
some
action.
what
he
leaves
out
is
the
following
sentence:
the
contractor
shall
have
the
right
of
appeal
under
the
disputes
clause
from
any
determination
by
the
contracting
officer.
"and
while
the
general
spends
an
awful
lot
of
time
talking
about
what
do
you
do
in
the
article
iii
context,
the
contracting
disputes
act
specifically
allows
to
us
go
to
a
board
of
contract
appeals,
which
is
not
an
article
iii
institution;
and
i
guarantee
you
that
the
government
would
be
making
exactly
the
same
argument
if
we
had
taken
that
particular
route.
"
it
seems
to
me
the
case
ought
not
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
this
kind
of
a
technical
assessment.
the
case
ought
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
sort
of
where
the
rights
are
and
what's
the
fundamental
change
and
who's
making
the
shift
in
one
direction
or
the
other;
and
if
you
do
that
--
and
justice
ginsburg,
you
specifically
asked
the
question,
am
i
asking
for
all
or
nothing?
no.
i
think
there's
no
question
you
can
come
up
with
a
principled
basis
to
adopt
precisely
the
principle
that
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
which
is
to
say
we
will
stay
our
hand,
we
--
we
will
not
uphold
the
--
the
contracting
officer's
decision,
and
therefore
we're
not
going
to
say
there's
a
default--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
we're
not
going
to
go
the
extra
mile
and
say
it's
a
termination
for
convenience.
the
court
can
certainly
do
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
is
a
middle
way.
there's
no
question
about
it.
all
i
was
saying
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
was,
you
know--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--on
the
principle
of
law
if
you
don't
have
a
contract
for
default,
then
there's
no
basis
for
--
and
we're
not
going
to
do
any
more
than
that;
we
can't
decide
who's
right
and
who's
wrong,
and
therefore
we're
not
going
to
enforce
the
contracting
officer's
decision,
or
we're
not
going
to
do
anything
more
than
this.
we're
going
to
leave
the
status
quo
ante,
which
means
before
the
contracting
officers
declared
that
there
was
a
default
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
actually
get
that
a
lot,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
i
don't
read
that,
justice
kagan.
i
mean,
we
--
we
certainly
have
a
due
process
argument
in
there,
but
embedded
in
there
as
well
is
--
are
a
number
of
references
to
federal
common
law
principles
as
a
--
as
a
--
obviously
nonconstitutional
basis
on
which
to
rule
in
our
favor.
and
i
--
i
think
the
court
ought
to
be
informed
in
--
in
making
its
determination
about
how
to
interpret
the
contracting
arrangement
by
the
question
of
whether
this
is
fundamentally
unfair
and
unconscionable,
obviously,
but
you
would
probably
do
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
principles,
and
trying
to
decide
on
the
--
on
contracting
principles
or
not.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
your
honors,
this
has
been
fundamentally
unfair
and
we
would
ask
for
the
court
to
reverse.
