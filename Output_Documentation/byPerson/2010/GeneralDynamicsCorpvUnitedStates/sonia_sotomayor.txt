mr.
phillips--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--why
wasn't
the
need
to
share
that
technology
a
part
of
this
contract
or
a
condition
to
the
contract.
i've
gone
through
the
contract
--
or,
not
all
of
it;
enough
of
it.
i
haven't
found
anywhere
in
the
contract
that
it
requires
the
u.s.
to
share
information
with
you.
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
what
due
process
would
require?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
going
to
pose
a
hypothetical.
let's
assume
the
contract
required
the
sharing
of
state
secrets
and
the
government
then
invokes
its
privilege.
is
that
a
different
case
than
this
one
in
terms
of
due
process?
wouldn't
the
--
wouldn't
the
former
situation,
where
it's
been
made
a
condition
of
the
contract,
require
a
different
treatment
than
this
situation
where
the
government's
just
saying,
if
you
want
to
raise
a
defense
that's
not
part
of
the
contract,
then
you
do
what
every
other
litigant
with
a
privilege
does
--
who
a
privilege
has
been
invoked
against;
you
proceed
with
whatever
evidence
you
have.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
usually
what
happens
with
other
privileges.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
wait
a
minute.
where's
the
obligation
of
the
government
to
tell
you,
build
it
this
way
using
the
technology
we
already
have.
i
thought
your
claim
was
that
you
were
promised
this
information
and
you
structured
the
contract
based
on
that
promise.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
there's
a
factual
dispute
about
that.
i
think
somewhere
i
read
that
there
is
a
claim
that
they
told
you
your
weight
estimates
weren't
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
phillips,
give
us
a
way,
a
reasoned
way,
to
reach
the
result
justice
scalia
is
suggesting,
because
you
are
being
greedy.
you
admitted
it.
the
termination--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--a
termination
for--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--convenience
carries
its
own
automatic
consequences
that
appear
unfair
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
litigation
of
the
default
termination
has
been
invoked
because
there
is
a
risk
to
the
united
states.
so,
is
there
a
reasoned
way
to
do
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
not
--
to
not
impose
that
unfairness
on
the
government?
and
if
there's
not,
then
explain
to
me
why
it's
unfair,
given
that
you're
two
sophisticated
contracting
parties,
to
say
you
entered
a
contract
knowing
the
government
could
invoke
state
secrets,
it
has,
and
so
you
bear
the
risk
of
that.
i
mean,
you
always
knew
the
government
could
do
this.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
goes
back
to
my
original
question
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
could
have
contracted
around
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
before
we
get
there,
that
showing
was
based
on
the
court's
in
camera
review
of
quite
a
bit
of
already
confidential
information,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
the
nonprivileged
information.
so
it
made
this
judgment
on
the
basis
of
a
great
deal
of
information,
and
yet
it
couldn't
conclude
that
you
were
right
as
a
matter
of
law,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
--
could
i
--
i'm
interrupting
justice
alito,
because
you
answered
his
question
very
quickly.
it's
your
position
that
if
we
determine
you're
the
moving
party,
you
lose?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
is
that
what
your
answer
to
him--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--which
is
that
he
asked
you
whether
we
apply
reynolds;
you
didn't
say
which
part
of
reynolds.
are
you
conceding
that
if
we
apply
reynolds
and
we
find
you're
the
moving
party,
you
lose?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
what
would
happen--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
you
can't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
you
can't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that's
what
i
don't
understand.
yes,
the
default
provision
is
decided
by
the
contracting
officer,
but
by
law
you
can't
collect
on
that
judgment
once
they
file
a
complaint.
so
you
can't
do
anything
until
you
get
the
court
to
affirm
your
default.
you
are
asking
for
a
legal
declaration
of
being
right,
that
they
defaulted.
that's
--
you're
the
one
seeking--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
you're
going
too
fast
for
me
and
i
don't
think
i
remember
this
in
your
reply
brief.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
do
you
have
the
citation
to
that
footnote
you
referred
to
in
the
602
--
605b?
i
can
find
it
later,
but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
your
view
is
that
--
that
the
complaint
did
not
stay
their
obligation
to
pay
you;
that
provision
required
them
to
pay
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
unliquidated
sums?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
on
what
principle
of
law?
