justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
then
you
go
on
to
say:
moreover,
give
us
--
give
us
the
payment
for
the
additional
money
beyond
the
1.35
that
you've
already
given
us--
justice
antonin
scalia
--plus
this
additional
money
that
we've
expended.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
shouldn't
we?
i
mean,
it
--
it
--
it
seems
to
me
if
--
if
indeed
you
say
the
government
has
come
up
with
a
defense
that
makes
it
impossible
to
decide
who's
in
the
right
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
don't
we
just
--
you
know,
i
--
i
think
the
usual
course
taken
by
courts
would
be
to
leave
the
parties
where
they
are.
the
matter
can't
be
litigated.
that
would
mean
you
would
keep
your
$1.35
billion,
but
you
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
sue
for
the
additional
amount.
if
--
if
you
were
that
worried,
you
should
have
--
you
--
you
should
have
had
more
frequent
progress
payments
or
something.
why
don't
we
just
leave
you
where
you
are,
both
you
and
the
government,
assuming
we
agree
with
you
on
all
the
rest?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
you
would
be
1.35
billion--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
with
interest.
i
forgot
the
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
government
didn't
do
that.
i
mean,
you're
making
it
up.
the
government
didn't
terminate
for
convenience.
the
government
claimed
you're
in
default.
why
would
--
why
should
we
force
that
down
the
government's
throat
when
we
can
no
more
say
that
the
government's
wrong
than
we
can
say
that
you're
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you
call
the
game
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
fallacy
is
we're
not
--
assuming
we
agree
with
you
on
the
rest,
we're
not
saying
that
it's
not
a
default
termination.
we're
saying
we
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
saying
we
don't
know,
we
don't
know
what
the
state
secrets
thing
is.
the
government
is
entitled
to
--
to
make
that
determination,
so
we
don't
know
who's
in
the
right
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
force
the
government
to
--
to
--
to
go
to
a
termination
for
convenience?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
talk
about
moving
party.
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
that
moving
party
means
who
comes
into
court
first.
i
would,
i
would
--
in
the
--
in
the
context
of
a
contract
dispute,
i
would
say
the
moving
party
is
the
party
who
is
trying
to
use
principles
of
law
to
change
the
contract,
and
that's
the
government
here.
the
government
--
the
government
is
blowing
the
whistle;
it
is
the
government
which
is
saying,
you
are
in
default,
and
under
the
law,
since
you're
in
default,
we
can
walk
away,
and
indeed
we
can
claim
the
money
we've
already
paid
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
to
me
the
moving
party
in
the
--
in
the
context
of
a
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
reynolds
was
talking
about
that
because
that
was
the
fact
situation
in
reynolds.
but
i'm
saying
that
the
logic
of
the
matter,
the
logic
of
the
matter
when
applied
to
a
contract
situation
such
as
this
ought
to
be
the
party
who
is
blowing
the
whistle,
who
is
trying
to
use
the
law
--
the
one
--
the
one
who
is
asserting
that
--
that
the
law
requires
this
result,
and
then
we
say,
well,
we
can't
tell
whether
the
law
requires
this
result
or
not.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
ought
to
be
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
wasn't
the
undoubted
right
of
the
government
before
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
it
was
the
undoubted
right
of
the
lawsuit
only
if
the
contracting
officer
was
correct
that
there
had
been
a
default.
if
he
was
wrong
about
that,
it
was
not
the
right
of
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
they
--
they
claim
that
you
knew
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
what
they
contracted
with
you
to
do
at
the
weight
of
plane
which
they
promised
to
come
across
with.
they
say
that
you
knew
that
because
of
--
of
other
contracts
that
you
had
had,
and
yet
didn't
--
didn't
tell
them
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
whether
that's
true
or
not,
and
we're
never
going
to
know
it's
true,
because
you
came
in
and
blew
the
whistle
and
said:
state-secrets
privilege.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
it
was
not
impossible
to
do
it
at
that
weight?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
weight
contracted
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
how
the
contract's
written.
i
mean,
if
we're
going
to
--
if
we're
going
to
say
that
there's
been
a
broken
play,
that
we're
not
going
to
try
to
apply
the
contract
because
we
can't
tell
who's
in
the
right
and
who's
in
the
wrong,
it's
totally
irrelevant
what
the
contract
says.
you
just
leave
the
parties
where
they
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
a
moving
party,
and
you
are
never
the
moving
party.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
granting
nobody
relief.
we're
leaving
you
where
you
are.
"get
out
of
here"
is
what
we're
saying.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
know
what
the
answer
is,
so
go
away;
we
leave
you
where
you
are.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that
assumes
that
the
contracting
officer's
termination
for
default
was
valid.
and
we
don't
know
that
it
was
valid,
and
we
don't
want
to
have
to
inquire
whether
it
was
valid.
so
to
say
"go
away"
means
everybody
keeps
the
money
he
has.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
unliquidated?
i
didn't
get
the
distinction
between
the
--
why
is
the
1.35
unliquidated?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
other?
what's
the
--
what's
the
other
1.25
billion--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
he's
also
asking
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
"go
away"
principle
of
our
jurisprudence,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--
i'm
already
tired.
let
me
care
that
much
about
this
one.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
--
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
general
dynamics
and
boeing,
the
petitioners
here,
entered
a
fixed
price
$4.8
billion
contract
to
develop
a
stealth
fighter
aircraft
for
the
navy.
after
they
had
fallen
well
behind
schedule,
the
contracting
officer
terminated
the
contract
for
default
and
ordered
the
companies
to
repay
approximately
$1.35
billion
in
progress
payments
for
work
the
government
never
accepted.
petitioners
filed
suit
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
challenging
the
termination
under
the
contract
disputes
act
of
1978.
they
argued
that
federal
circuit
precedent
would
excuse
their
default
because
the
government
had
failed
to
share
its
"superior
knowledge"
about
how
to
design
and
manufacture
stealth
aircraft.
as
the
litigation
proceeded,
it
proved
difficult
to
uncover
the
extent
of
the
--
of
the
government's
superior
knowledge
because
the
design,
materials
and
manufacturing
process
for
prior
stealth
aircraft
operated
by
the
air
force
are
closely
guarded
military
secrets.
after
some
of
those
secrets
were
inadvertently
disclosed
during
discovery,
the
acting
secretary
of
the
air
force
warned
the
court
of
federal
claims
that
further
discovery
into
the
extent
of
the
government's
superior
knowledge
would
risk
disclosing
classified
information.
the
court
terminated
discovery
and
declared
the
superior
knowledge
question
to
be
nonjusticiable.
after
years
of
litigation
and
two
remands
from
the
federal
circuit,
the
court
of
federal
claims
finally
sustained
the
default
termination.
the
federal
circuit
affirmed
that
judgment.
it
agreed
that
the
state-secrets
privilege
prevented
adjudicating
petitioners'
superior
knowledge
defense
and
it
rejected
petitioners'
argument
that
the
government
could
not
pursue
a
claim
against
the
party
and
then
use
the
state-secrets
privilege
to
preempt
defenses
to
that
claim.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
state-secrets
holding.
today,
in
the
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
federal
circuit
believed
that
our
1953
decision
in
united
states
versus
reynolds
had
already
rejected
petitioners'
arguments.
we
think
that
reynolds
has
--
has
less
to
do
with
these
cases
than
the
court
of
appeals
or
for
that
matter,
the
party's
belief.
reynolds
upheld
the
government's
assertion
of
the
state-secret
privilege
to
exclude
certain
evidence
in
a
trial
dealing
with
injuries
caused
by
the
b-29
bomber.
the
case
was
about
the
admission
of
evidence.
it
decided
a
purely
evidentiary
dispute
by
applying
evidentiary
rules.
the
privilege
information
was
excluded
and
the
trial
went
on
without
it.
here,
by
contrast,
the
court
of
federal
claims
decreed
the
substantive
result
that
since
invocation
of
the
state-secrets
privilege
obscured
too
many
of
the
facts
relevant
to
the
superior
knowledge
defense,
that
defense
was
simply
not
available.
what
we
are
called
upon
to
exercise
today
is
not
our
power
to
determine
the
procedural
rules
of
evidence,
but
rather
our
common
law
authority
to
fashion
contractual
remedies
in
government-contracting
disputes.
and
our
state-secrets
jurisprudence
bearing
upon
that
authority
is
not
reynolds,
but
two
cases
dealing
with
alleged
contracts
to
spy.
our
1876
decision
in
totten
versus
united
states
and
our
2005
decision
in
tenet
versus
doe,
both
held
that
"public
policy
forbids
suits
based
on
covert
espionage
agreements."
totten
was
a
suit
by
a
claimed
union
spy
in
the
civil
war
for
the
compensation
he
had
allegedly
been
promised.
tenet
was
a
suit
by
claimed
cia
spies
for
compensation
they
had
allegedly
been
promised.
rather
than
risk
disclosure
of
espionage
relationships,
we
left
the
parties
to
those
suits
where
we
found
them
the
day
they
came
into
court.
we
think
a
similar
situation
obtains
here
and
that
the
same
consequence
should
follow.
reliability
depends
upon
the
validity
of
a
plausible,
superior
knowledge
defense.
and
when
full
litigation
of
that
defense
"would
inevitably
lead
to
the
disclosure"
of
state-secrets,
i
have
to
quote
from
totten,
neither
party
can
obtain
judicial
relief.
as
the
court
of
federal
claims
concluded,
that
is
the
situation
here
for
reasons
explained
in
our
opinion.
however,
it
seems
to
us
unrealistic
to
separate,
as
the
court
of
federal
claims
did,
the
claim
from
the
defense
and
to
allow
the
former
to
proceed
while
the
latter
is
barred.
it
is
claims
and
defenses
together
that
established
the
justification
or
lack
of
justification
for
judicial
relief.
and
when
public
policy
precludes
judicial
intervention
for
the
one,
it
should
preclude
judicial
intervention
for
the
other
as
well.
we
therefore
leave
the
parties
with
the
funds
and
property
in
their
possession
when
they
knocked
on
the
courthouse
door.
this
disposition
will
please
neither
side.
general
dynamics
but
not
boeing
wants
us
to
convert
the
termination
into
one
for
the
government's
convenience
awarding
petitioners
$1.2
billion,
the
language
of
the
a-12
agreement
does
not
give
us
this
option.
moreover,
state-secrets
would
make
it
impossible
to
calculate
petitioners'
damages.
the
government,
for
its
part,
wants
a
return
of
the
$1.35
billion
it
paid
petitioners
in
progress
payments
for
work
which
it
says
it
never
approved.
but
the
validity
of
that
claim
depends
upon
whether
petitioners
are
in
default
on
their
contract
which
cannot
be
judicially
determined
because
of
the
valid
assertion
--
assertion
of
the
state-secrets
privilege.
as
in
totten,
our
refusal
to
enforce
this
contract
captures
what
the
ex
ante
expectations
of
the
parties
were
or
reasonably
ought
to
have
been.
both
parties
must
have
understood
that
state-secrets
would
prevent
courts
from
resolving
many
possible
disputes
under
the
a-12
agreement.
we
believe,
moreover,
that
the
impact
of
our
ruling
on
these
particular
cases,
which
we
think
produces
rough,
very
rough
equity,
is
probably
much
more
significant
than
its
impact
in
future
cases,
except
to
the
extent
that
it
renders
a
law
more
predictable
and
hence,
more
subject
to
accommodation
by
contracting
parties
and
contracting
parties
who
have
continuing
relationships
to
companies
that
entered
contracts
involving
state-secrets
that
are
repeat
offenders.
the
foregoing
analysis
assumes
that
the
government
generally
has
an
obligation
to
share
its
superior
knowledge.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
two
of
the
government's
arguments
for
why
that
assumption
may
not
apply
here.
it
had
no
need
to,
given
its
holding.
we
did
not
grant
certiorari
to
decide
those
questions,
so
they
remained
open
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
address
some
remand.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
cases
are
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
