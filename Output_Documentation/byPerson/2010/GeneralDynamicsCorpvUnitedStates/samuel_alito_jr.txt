well,
the
petitioners
as
a
formal
matter
were
the
moving
party,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
were
the
plaintiffs.
and
the
review
scheme
that
you
outlined
was
known
to
them
beforehand.
so
why
do
we
need
to
look
beyond
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
shouldn't
we
view
this
as
if
it
were
a
dispute
between
two
private
contracting
parties?
and
if
we
did
that,
perhaps
one
party
would
be
the
moving
party
with
respect
to
some
of
the
claims
and
the
other
party
would
be
the
moving
party
with
respect
to
the
remaining
claims.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
am
i
correct
to
interpret
what
you
just
said
to
mean
that
you
think
this
case
should
be
decided
under
the
basic
principle
of
reynolds,
that
the
party
that
seeks
the
affirmative
relief
--
seeks
affirmative
relief
from
the
court
is
the
--
is
the
party
that
bears
the
burden
involving
the
invocation
of
the
state-secrets
privilege?
you're
not
asking
us
to
adopt
a
new
test
applicable
in
the
contracts
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
have
the
burden
of
--
you
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
issue
of
default.
that
was
known,
too,
wasn't
it?
