justice
ruth
bader

mr.
phillips,
when
the
contractors
--
when
they
failed
to
deliver
the
first
aircraft
at
the
time
specified
by
the
contract,
their
reason
was
that
its
costs
would
far
outrun
the
contract
price,
and
so
it
sought
to
reformulate
the
contract.
at
that
time
--
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
think
at
that
time
the
contractor
said
nothing
at
all
about
superior
knowledge
and
the
government's
obligation
to
share
information
that
it
hadn't
shared.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
expect
them
to
say,
if
that
was
the
impediment
to
going
forward
on
this
contract,
to
at
least
mention
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
explain
--
you've
referred
to
it
several
times
now.
i
thought
that
that
was
not
a
progress
payment
based
on
completed
work.
the
government
says
that
that
money
was
advanced;
you
had
not
complied
with
what
was
necessary
to
comply
with
to
get
that
$1.35
million.
they
distinguished
the
$1.35
million
that
you
legitimately
received
as
a
progress
payment,
but
this
next
they
say
you
have
not
fulfilled
what
you
needed
to
do
to
get
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
here
seeking
to
--
to
emerge
as
a
total
winner,
that
is
to
get
from
this
contract
what
you
would
have
gotten
if
it
had
been
successfully
completed,
including
any
profit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
--
i
--
i
think
it's
questionable,
mr.
phillips,
for
this
reason.
you
say
that
it's
an
implied
term
of
this
contract
that
the
government
has
a
duty
to
share
certain
information,
and
you
are
seeking
to
enforce
that
implied
term
of
the
contract.
so
it
seems
to
me
as
to
that
alleged
duty
you
are
the
moving
party.
you're
saying:
court,
please
enforce
this
implied
term
of
the
contract.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mentioned
the
1.3
--
that
you
get
to
keep
the
1.35
million,
but
there
was
also
another
figure,
1.2
million
that
you
would
get
on
top
of
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
certainly
wouldn't
be
leaving
you
where
you
were.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
thinking
of
a
tort.
it
wasn't
thinking
of
--
reynolds
is
a
tort
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
--
am
i
right
that
this
contract
did
specify
certain
information
that
the
government
agreed
to
give
the
petitioner?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips
said
the
reason
they
couldn't
specify
this
information
is
they
didn't
know
what
it
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
--
they
didn't
know
what
--
it
was
secret
information.
they
didn't
know
--
wouldn't
even
know
what
to
ask
for.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
there
is
--
do
you
agree
that
there
is
nothing
between
--
i
think
justice
scalia
was
asking
mr.
phillips,
why
can't
we
just
say,
let's
--
all
bets
are
off,
everybody
go
home
with
what
they
have.
but
mr.
phillips
says
there
are
only
these
two
things;
there
is
either
default
termination
or
termination
for
convenience,
and
nothing
in
between.
do
you
agree
that
that's
the
world
that
we're
dealing
with,
those
two
choices
and
nothing
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you're
right
about
that,
the
government's
absolute
right,
could
you
withhold
it
from
other
contracts
of
these
contractors?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you
are
saying
there
is
another
way,
there's
a
middle
way?
