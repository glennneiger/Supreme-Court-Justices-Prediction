justice
elena
kagan
mr.
phillips,
could
i
ask
you
whether
that
principle
makes
any
sense
in
this
contracting
situation,
because
both
parties
have
argued
it
as
though
the
question
of
who
is
the
moving
party
is
determinative
of
this
case,
but
in
a
contract
situation
the
question
of
who's
the
moving
party
is
very
often
arbitrary
or
fortuitous.
if
you
think
about
it
in
a
private
setting,
you
have
one
contract,
one
contractor
who
fails
to
perform
or
--
or
provides
some
deficient
product,
another
who
decides
it's
not
going
to
pay,
and
the
question
of
who
the
plaintiff
is,
is
often
just
a
matter
of
fortuity,
who
gets
to
the
courthouse
first--
justice
elena
kagan
--what
the
payment
schedule
has
been
like,
so
whether
somebody
is
demanding
their
money
back
or
simply
refusing
to
pay
it
at
all.
so,
why
in
this
contract
situation
is
the
question
of
who's
the
plaintiff
or
who's
the
moving
party,
why
does
--
why
does
that
make
such
a
difference?
justice
elena
kagan
but
it
can't
possibly
be
the
case
that
the
question
is
what
the
payment
schedule
is.
if
i've
paid
you
already
and
then
i
find
your
product
deficient,
then
i'm
going
to
go
to
court
and
demand
my
money
back.
if
i
find
your
product
deficient
before
i
pay
you,
then
you
are
going
to
go
to
court
and
say,
you
have
to
pay
me.
so
why
should
that
difference
make
a
difference
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
question
before
us?
justice
elena
kagan
both
parties
have
a
claim
here.
one
says
you
provided
deficient
performance;
the
other
says
you
were
obligated
to
pay
me.
the
question
of
who
has
the
claim
and
who
has
the
affirmative
defense,
it
can
be
structured
in
either
way.
justice
elena
kagan
so
just
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
argument,
suppose
that
state
secrets
had
prevented
you
from
being
able
to
prove
your
default
claim,
that
you
were
unable
to
make
that
showing
because
of
state
secrets.
what
would
happen
then?
justice
elena
kagan
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--that's
right,
that
the
secrets
that
you
wanted
to
protect
were
actually
the
--
the
key
to
your
proving
that
there
was
a
default.
justice
elena
kagan
let
me
make
sure
i
understand,
because
that
really
does
sound
like
a
tails
you
win,
heads
you
win,
whatever.
you're
saying
that
if
the
state
secrets
prevented
you
from
making
your
affirmative
case,
you
should
win
that
one,
too?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
phillips,
i
understood
your
papers
as
making
only
a
constitutional
claim.
