mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
basic
things
decide
this
case.
first,
the
government
is
not
affirmatively
invoking
the
power
of
the
federal
court;
only
the
plaintiffs
are.
it
was
mr.
phillips's
clients
who
20
years
ago
walked
into
the
federal
court
and
asked
that
court
to
set
aside
the
decision
of
the
contracting
officer
and
to
award
them
over
a
billion
dollars
in
damages.
the
government,
by
contrast,
simply
asked
the
court
to
dismiss
the
federal
lawsuit.
and
second,
reynolds
makes
clear
that
the
state-secrets
privilege
will
be
used
to
bar
a
claim
at
most
only
when
the
party
that
is
relying
on
secret
information
is
trying
to
use
the
federal
court
to
alter
the
legal
status
quo.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
for
several
reasons.
one
is,
that
is
the
affirmative
use
of
the
federal
courts
to
alter
the
legal
status
quo.
i
think
the
principle
of
reynolds
is--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
disagree,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
the
contract
itself
specifies
that
the
contracting
officer
will
decide
whether
or
not
there's
a
default
termination,
and
once
there
is
that,
they
owe
--
once
the
contracting
officer
so
decides,
then
they
owe
the
unliquidated
payments
that
have--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
it's
certainly
an
affirmative
step
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
but
it
is
not
an
affirmative
step
of
the
federal
court.
our
central
proposition--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--undoubtedly
the
case,
and
those
are
the
terms
under
the
contract
to
which
they
agreed.
our
central
proposition
is
that
in
a
world
in
which
the
federal
court
doesn't
know,
as
justice
scalia
said,
who
is
right
and
who
is
wrong
on
a
particular
claim,
it
should
stay
its
hand
entirely
and
get
out
of
the
business
altogether.
it
should
follow
the
hippocratic
principle
of
doing
no
harm.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
absolutely.
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
there.
i
do
think
that
there
are
special
arguments
available
in
this
case
because
it
is
a
contract,
as
justice
breyer
said,
with
sophisticated
parties
who
ex
ante
will
decide
who
bears
the
burden
of
coming
into
court
and
--
and
so
on.
but
here
i
think
this
is
a
simple
principle
that,
in
a
world
in
which
the
court
doesn't
know
who
is
right
and
wrong
in
the
superior
knowledge
defense
--
and
that's
the
answer
to
the
question
that
justice
sotomayor
asked
to
mr.
phillips
a
moment
ago
about
what
did
the
court
of
federal
claims
ultimately
decide?
they
didn't
decide
there
was
a
prima
facie
case.
they
said
at
page
245a
of
the
2001
opinion:
we
can't
know
one
way
or
the
other.
and
so--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--oh,
no.
i
think--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--no,
we--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--oh,
absolutely
not,
justice
sotomayor.
i
don't
think
reynolds
says
that
if
the
government
is
the
moving
party
it's
an
automatic
loss.
i
think
that's
a
back-up
argument
that
we've
advanced
in
our
brief
that
i
think
there
is
no
reason
whatsoever
for
the
court
to--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
important
to
add
to
your
definition
"using
legal
principles
in
a
federal
court.
"
because
that's
i
think
what
reynolds
is
talking
about.
there's
not
some
abstract--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
don't
think,
justice,
that's
what
either
reynolds
is
getting
at
or
what
this
court's
subsequent
decisions
about
a
state
of
uncertainty
in
the
law
and
what
the
role
of
the
federal
courts
is
getting
at.
i
think
rather
what
all
of
these
decisions
say
together
is
if
you
don't
know
one
way
or
another,
you
should
return;
you
should
wind
the
clock
back
to
the
status
quo
ante
before
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
and
at
that
status
quo
ante
there
was
undoubted
a
right
of
the
government
to
have
$1.35
billion.
now,
i
understand
some
of
you
have
suggested,
well,
maybe
we
should
just
cut
it
even
and
they
get
to
keep
the
$1.35
billion
and
we
get
to
keep
--
and
we
don't
have
to
pay
the
$1.2
billion.
i
suggest
there's
no
principled
way
to
do
that,
which
is
what
i
think
mr.
phillips's
answer--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
scalia,
let
me
read
to
you
the
contract
to
which
they
agreed.
it's
at
joint
appendix,
page
120
to
'21:
"if
the
contract
is
terminated
under
the
default
clause,
the
contractor
shall,
on
demand,
repay
to
the
government
the
amount
of
unliquidated
progress
payments.
"
and
then
what
happened
as
a
result
of
that
demand
letter
that
we
sent
right
after
--
after
the
termination
for
default,
was
they
came
to
us,
hat
in
hand,
and
said:
please
don't
take
this
money
from
us
right
now,
our
banks
are
going
to
complain,
and
so
on.
and
so
we
entered
into
a
deferment
agreement,
which
is
pages--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--joint
appendix
page
342.
and
it
seems
to
me
a
very
odd
notion
of
due
process
to
say
that
somehow,
the
fact
that
we
agreed
to
their
deferment
creates
some
entitlement
for
them
to
keep
the
$1.35
billion.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
guess
i
would
say
two
things.
one
is,
if
you
look--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--right.
i
think
if
you
--
if
you
were
to
look
to
that
background
common
law
contract
principle,
you
would
look
not
just
to
reynolds,
but
to
tenet
--
or
excuse
me,
totten,
which
i
think
makes
clear
that
at
the
time
they
signed
their
contract
they
were
on
notice
that
highly
classified
information
that
is
the
subject
of
--
of
litigation,
is
something
that
generally
can't
be
litigated
in
the
federal
court.
and
then
if
you
wanted
to
think
about
due
process
and
the
overlay
of
unconscionability
or
whatever
with
respect
to
federal
contracts,
you
would
ordinarily
assume
that
the
contract
itself
from
highly
sophisticated
parties
would
work
that
out
ahead
of
time.
and
so
if
they
were
concerned
about
this
situation
unfolding,
they
could
have
written
into
the
contract
that
they
should
get
certain
information
and
that
if
the
government
invoked
the
state-secrets
privilege,
it
would
automatically
terminate
the
contract's
default
and
convert
it
to
--
the
default
termination
into
a
termination
for
convenience.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
don't
think
it
comes
out
as
a
wash,
justice
kennedy,
because
i
think
the
contract
is
undoubtedly
clear
that
in
order
to
challenge
the
--
the
decision
of
the
contracting
officer
about
a
default
termination,
they
have
to
come
into
federal
court
and
invoke
affirmatively,
seek
affirmative
judicial
relief
from
the
federal
court,
to
change
the
world.
we
don't
have
to
do
that.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
correct.
some
of
that
is
at
joint
appendix
137
to
140.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
yes.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
have
to
say,
it
is
a
very
odd
thing
to
bid
on
a
highly
--
a
multi-billion-dollar
contract
on
the
assumption
that
they
are
going
to
get
some
technology
that
they
haven't
even
specified.
i
mean,
this
--
we're
bidding
for
their
research
and
development.
they
brought
in
lockheed,
who
--
which
had
built
low-technology
--
low-observability
planes
--
precisely
for
the
reason
that
they
said
they
had
the
technology.
at
joint
appendix
page
1087,
you
see
their
bid,
their
offer,
and
i
don't
think
anyone
held
a
gun
to
their
back
to
say:
enter
into
this.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
scalia,
let
me
say
two
things.
first,
the
impossibility
of--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--two
things.
one
is,
that
impossibility
claim
was
separately
litigated
before
the
court
of
federal
claims,
along
with
18
other
claims
of
theirs
in
defense
to
the
1.35
billion
and
this
rest
that
we've
been
talking
about.
they
have
had
massive
opportunities
to
litigate
almost
all
of
their
challenges,
with
the
one
exception
being
the
superior
knowledge
aspect
of
this
case,
and
much
of
that
has
taken
place
in
a
highly
classified
environment.
the
trial
has
taken
place
in--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i'm
saying
--
well,
at
the
initial
weight,
we
thought
it
was
impossible
and
warned
them
as
such,
and
that's
--
those
are
the
citations
in
the
government's
brief.
but
--
so--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
then
we
--
at
the
weight
contracted
for,
we
had
warned
them
that
it
wasn't,
and
then
later
we
relaxed
that
weight
specification.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
is
really
present
one
way
or
the
other.
but
our
central
submission
to
you,
justice
scalia,
is:
if
you're
not
sure,
as
you
were
saying
to
me
--
you
don't
know
who
is
right
and
who
is
wrong
--
then
the
federal
court
shouldn't
be
complicit
in
the
process
of
siding
and
picking
winners
and
losers
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
sure.
i
could
imagine
that
we
could
be
on
a
counterclaim,
for
example.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
correct.
the
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
cfc--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that's
correct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
it's
a
convenient
rule,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
they
agreed
to
when
they
signed
the
contract.
the
cda
was
on
the
books.
they
knew
the
deal
going
in,
which
is
if
they
wanted
to
challenge
the
decision
of
the
contracting
officer
they
would
have
to
come
in.
now,
you
could
have
structured
it
very
differently.
you
could
have
said
we
--
you
know,
that
there
would
have
to
be
--
that
--
that
if
there
were
a
termination
for
default,
it
would
automatically
change
into
a
termination
for
convenience--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--we
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
default,
but
not
on
superior
knowledge,
the
precise
question
here.
in
their
rule,
if
you
--
if
you
follow
their
rule,
they're
asking
the
court
to
proceed
counterfactually
and
say
that
they
are
entitled
to
not
just
the
1.35,
but
the
1.2
billion
on
top
of
that,
as
if
they
had
proved
their
superior
knowledge
claim.
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
do
agree
that
that
is
--
that's
the
way
the
contract
is
written.
it
distinguished
between
those
two
and
distinguished
between
liquidated
payments,
as
to
which
the
government
has
no
right
in
the
event
of
a
default
termination,
and
we're
not
seeking
that,
and
unliquidated
payments,
as
to
which
the
government
has
an
absolute
right
at
the
moment
the
contracting
officer
decides
there
has
been
a
default
termination.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
scalia,
i
am
saying
leave
the
parties
where
they
are
under
the
terms
of
the
contract.
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
that
--
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that
the
federal
court
should
be
in
the
business
of
micromanaging
under
the
due
process
clause
in
a
contractual
situation
with
parties
that
can
protect
themselves
ex
ante
very
easily.
i
mean,
they
say--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--so
even
if
you
followed
that
reasoning
--
and
i
don't
think
you
should,
for
a
reason
i'll
explain
in
a
moment
--
but
they
would
still
lose,
because
they
still
bear
the
burden
of
proof
and
persuasion
on
superior
knowledge,
the
defense,
the
excuse,
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
now,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
the
rule,
that
that's
an
appropriate
rule,
justice
kennedy,
because
i
think
underlying
reynolds
is
the
central
proposition
that
a
court
shouldn't
be
involved,
shouldn't
be
picking
winning
--
winners
and
losers
either
way,
when
the
state
of
knowledge
is
unknowable.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
unable
to
make
the
showing
in--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--in
federal
court?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
in
that
circumstance,
again,
the
--
i
think
the
case
would
be
dismissed,
because
they
would
be
coming
in
and
seeking
affirmative
judicial
relief
to
void
the
contracting
officer's
decision
and
to
get
whatever
damages
they
want
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
think
--
i
think
that
that
would
be
--
the
general
proposition
is
if
the
federal
court
can't
know
one
way
or
another
who's
right
and
who's
wrong,
it
shouldn't
grant
affirmative
relief
to
a
party,
and
that's--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
again,
justice
scalia,
that's
the
contract
they
signed.
they
could
have
signed
a
different
contract
with
different
results.
but
they
say--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--we
didn't
have
the
ability--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
contract
didn't
say
"moving
party",
but
it
did
say
who
had
to
come
into
federal
court
in
order
to
challenge
the
decision
of
the
contracting
officer.
and
that
is
a
--
that
--
that
--
and
it
puts
that
burden
on
them.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
sotomayor,
this
is
a
very
important
question,
and
i
think
that
that's
the
impression
left
by
their
briefs
and
it's
wrong.
so
the
filing
of
their
claim
--
their
claim
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
they
say
vacated
the
contracting
officer's
decision.
that's
wrong
under
the
statute.
605(b)
in
the
--
in
the
contracting
disputes
act
says
that
a
clause
can
be
put
into
the
contract
to
continue
it
in
effect
and
require
performance
even
if
there's
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
federal
claims,
and
that
provision
exists
in
this
very
contract.
so--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
think
it
is.
it's
in
a
footnote
of
our
reply
brief,
and
it
cites
to
605(b).
and
our
claim
is
that
--
that
that
provision
requires
--
right
now
we
have
an
absolute
entitlement
to
the
$1.35
billion.
that
is
what
the
contract
says,
that
is
what
even
the
deferment
agreement
says
that
we've
entered
into.
so
we're
not
asking,
justice
sotomayor,
for
any
affirmative
judicial
relief
at
all.
we
don't
need
--
we
want
the
court,
as
it
does
in
state-secret
cases
such
as
tenet,
to
stay
out
entirely
and
say
--
to
deny
an
audience
to
this
case
on
the
merits.
and
if
you
do
what
mr.
phillips
says
or
if
you
do
what
justice
scalia
suggested,
the
kind
of
compromise
option,
that
is
affirmatively
using
the
power
of
the
federal
court,
granting
him
relief
on
a
claim
that
he
has
not
proven,
and
that
is
something
i
see
--
i
see
zero
precedent
for--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
scalia,
we
have
no--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
--
justice
scalia,
we
have
no
problem
with
a
go-away
rule.
and
if
you
did
that
and
you
return
to
the
status
pro
ante,
we
would
have
that
$1.35
billion.
that
is
what
the
contract
says,
that
is
what
their
own
filing
in
september
16,
1991,
said
before
the
court
of
federal
claims,
when
they
called
that
$1.35
billion,
quote,
"money
presently
due
and
owing".
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
scalia,
that
seems
to
me
--
that
is
affirmatively
using
the
power
of
the
court
to
set
aside
the
contracting
officer's
decision,
which
is
what
i
think
is
forbidden
by
reynolds.
and
it
would
be
an
odd
rule,
because
it's
basically
a
happenstance.
if
we
had
just
simply
insisted
on
our
$1.35
billion
at
the
moment
that
it
was
owed
to
us
in
february
of
1991,
we
wouldn't
even
be
having
this
conversation
right
now.
the
only
reason
we're
having
it
is
because
we
acceded
to
their
own
request
to
not
take
the
$1.35
billion
right
away.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
oh,
i
think
it
would
be
very
simple.
you
could
say:
in
the
event
the
government
invokes
the
state-secrets
privilege,
any
termination
for
default
automatically
becomes
a
termination
for
convenience.
that's
one
of
many--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--do
i
think
the
government
would?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
think
if
they
don't,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
underscores
the
problem
with
their
argument,
because
they
are
saying:
read
the
contract
precisely
this
way,
to
eliminate
terminations
for
default
and
convert
them
all
into
terminations
for
convenience
when
the
state-secrets
privilege
is
being
invoked.
and
i
agree
with
you,
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
unusual
contract
for
the
government
to
get
into.
that
is
what
they're
demanding
here,
and
that's--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well
--
well,
i
think
there
are
other
ways.
there's
the
possibility
that
they
may
demand
extra
money
in
exchange
for
greater
risk.
there
may
be
that
there
may
be
some
alternative
dispute
resolution
mechanisms
available.
i
don't
know,
but
i
would
--
i
would--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
it
might
depend
on
--
you
might
have
it
within
the
military,
you
know,
the
equivalent
of
that
--
in
the
tenet
v.
doe,
you
might
have
panels
like
the
helms
panel.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
precise
contractual
arrangements
would
be.
i
do
think
that
the
need
for
this
court
to
be
involved
is
a
lot
lower
than,
say,
in
the
criminal
context
of
reynolds,
because
the
government
here
is
a
repeat
player
with
these
contractors,
they're
not
in
the
business,
as
our
deferment
agreement,
i
think,
underscores
of
trying
to
willy-nilly
advance
the
state-secrets
privilege
to
undermine
and
take
their
money
away.
indeed,
i
think
since
the
2003
federal
circuit
decision
there
have
only
been
a
couple
of
instances,
at
most,
in
which
--
that
i'm
aware
of
in
which
the
government
has
invoked
the
state-secrets
privilege
in
any
sort
of
contracting
action,
and
nothing
like
the
superior
knowledge
thing.
and
since
2009,
the
governmental
altogether
in
civil
court
has
invoked
the
state-secrets
privilege
a
whopping
two
times,
to
--
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
sure.
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
due
process
is
an
ill-fitting
concept
in
this
contractual
dispute
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
not
just
can
the
sophisticated
parties
agree
ahead
of
time
to
other
things,
but
also
the
whole
notion
of
due
process
in
contracts
is
odd,
because
the
government
has
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
only
since
1855.
they
don't
have
any
freestanding
rights
to
come
in
ab
initio
and
claim
fundamental
fairness
on
contracts.
i
think
that
is
implicit
in
the
constitution
itself,
that
they
don't
have
that
right.
and,
so,
the
question
becomes,
is
there
some
extra
protection
the
courts
should
give
here
akin
to
the
one
in
reynolds
about
criminal
defendants
in
the
government
using
state
secrets
information?
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
because
parties
can
work
that
out
themselves
ex
ante.
and,
so,
my
answer
to
you
is,
i
think
it
was
option
b,
to
use
the
contract
as
the
base
--
and
contractual
interpretation
as
the
basic
rule
for
decision
here.
the
contract
itself
specified,
and
it
was
done
under
the
shadow
of
reynolds
and
under
the
shadow
of
--
of
totten
that
specified
that
they
would
have
to
be
the
moving
party,
they
would
have
to
come
in
and
challenge
the
decision
of
the
contracting
officer.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
do
think
that
with
respect
to
this
and
this
--
you
know,
a
thousands
and
thousands
of
page
contract,
i
think
this
specific
set
of
issues
could
have
been
worked
out
in
advance,
and
i
do
think
was
worked
out
in
advance.
they
knew,
going
in,
that
they
bore
the
burden
of
walking
into
court,
paying
their
attorneys,
and
everything
else,
to
challenge
the
decision
of
the
contracting
officer.
and
they
also
knew
at
that
moment
the
government
had
an
undoubted
right
to
the
unliquidated
progress
payments.
the
contract
they
signed
distinguished
between
liquidated
progress
payments
as
to
which
the
government
has
no
right,
and
unliquidated
payments
as
to
which
default
termination
automatically
gave
that
to
the
government.
and
the
argument
they're
advancing
here
is,
well,
let's
collapse
those
two,
let's
keep
the
$1.35
billion,
because
the
government
hasn't
given
it
to
us
yet.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
because
the
contract
specified
two
payment
streams.
one
is
the
work
that
they
had
reviewed
and
understood
and
the
government
had
said
this
is
good
work,
we're
going
to
pay
you
for
it;
and
other
work
which
are
claims
that
they
have
made
but
they
haven't
actually
been
approved
by
the
government.
and
i
think
mr.
phillips,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
sort
of
evidence
that
--
or
certainly
nothing
that
the
courts
below
found
that
says
that
the
--
that
they
had
a
right
to
the
unliquidated--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
1.2--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
1.25
billion
that
he's
seeking
on
top
of--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--keeping
the
1.35
billion,
as
i
understand
it
is
costs,
is
extra
costs
incurred
under
the
contract
above
and
beyond
the
$4.8
billion
that
was
in
the
initial
contract.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it's
page
32,
and
i
would
also
refer
the
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
appendix
page
19567,
which
is
the
page
of
the
contract
itself
that
incorporates
the
provision.
the
provision
is
far
52.233-1(h),
and
it
says
that
--
it
mandates
performance
and
compliance
with
the
contract
even
when
there
--
in
the
contracting
officer's
decision,
even
when
a
decision
is
under
appeal.
so
it
is
not
the
case
whatsoever
that
their
filing
of
this
claim
somehow
vacated
the
contracting
officer's
decision.
the
only
way
that
will
happen
is
if
this
federal
court
reverses
the
federal
circuit
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that's
correct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
right.
at
that
moment
they
had
to
pay.
they
knew
that
and
they
in
fact
sent
a
bank
letter
and
so
on
--
this
is
joint
appendix
329
--
saying
please
don't
do
that.
and
then
we
entered
into
a
deferment
agreement,
but
we
have
an
absolute
right
to
that
money
right
now
regardless
of
what
--
we
don't
need
an
affirmative
decision
from
this
court
in
order
to
get
that
money.
we're
asking
the
court
to
simply
stay
its
hand
and
follow
the
hippocratic
principle
of
doing
no
harm
in
a
world
in
which
the
--
the
court
can't
decide
who's
right
and
who's
wrong.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
absolutely
right.
the
federal
rules
and
the
contract
disputes
act
provide
us
an
offset
so
that
we
could
--
we
don't
have
to
actually
seek
the
1.35
billion
from
their
coffers,
as
he
colorfully
called
it,
reaching
into;
we
can
just
offset
it
against
future
contracts
and
the
federal
courts
would
be
out
of
the
business
altogether
about
that
1.35
billion.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
the
contract
to
which
they
signed.
thank
you.
