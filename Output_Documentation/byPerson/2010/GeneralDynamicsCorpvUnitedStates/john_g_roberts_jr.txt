chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-1298,
general
dynamics
v.
united
states,
and
the
consolidated
case,
09-1302,
the
boeing
company
v.
united
states.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
have
--
we've
gotten
to
this
point
in
the
dispute
because
you
say
they're
at
fault,
they
say
you're
at
fault.
under
the
state-secrets
doctrine,
we
can't
resolve
that
question.
why
don't
we
call
the
whole
thing
off?
nobody's
at
fault;
that
means
it's
terminated
not
for
fault,
but
for
convenience,
and
that's
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
only
because
you
altered
the
legal
status
quo.
the
legal
status
quo
is
they're
going
along
with
their
contract,
and
you
altered
it
by
holding
them
in
default.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
affirmative
step
with
the
contracting
officer
saying
there's
a
default?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
an
affirmative
step
of
the
federal
government.
he
works
for
you,
and
he's
the
one
changing
the
status
quo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
do
you
want
to
give
the
cite?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
ever
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--are
you
ever
the
moving
party
in
the
court
of
claims?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
on
a
counterclaim,
but
that
obviously
means
somebody
else
is
the
moving
party.
they've
raised
the
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
somebody
wants
to
get
money
--
if
somebody
wants
to
get
money
from
the
federal
government,
they
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
is
a
pretty
convenient
rule
for
you,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--now
justice
sotomayor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
would
you
write
--
you
keep
saying
these
are
sophisticated
parties.
what
would
the
contractual
term
look
like
that
would
avoid
this
problem?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
your
client
would
ever
agree
to
something
like
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
do
they
write
the
contract?
if
they
--
your
answer
can't
be
the
only
way
they
can
write
it
is
a
way
that
you
would
never
accept.
so
how
--
how
do
you
contract
around
this
problem?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
wouldn't
be
a
problem
in
an
alternative
dispute
resolution
because
that's
not
a
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
get
the
extra
money
without
having
to
go
to
court
because
then
they
would
have
to
go
to
court
and
challenge
your
offset?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
