justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
two
questions
i
would
have
is,
first
of
all
--
justice
sotomayor,
sorry;
i
didn't
--
i
did
have
her
question,
because
what
that
suggests
is
in
this
case
it's
not
unfair
to
hold
your
client
in
this
case,
and
you
just
read
the
two
circuit
court
opinions
here
and
you
think
this
is
a
defense
coming
out
of
long
in
the
past
that
doesn't
have
much
substance
to
it.
that
was
her
question,
i
think,
as
i
understood
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
it's
not
unfair.
but
let
me
give
you
the
other
question
because
some
time
in
your
argument
i
would
like
you
to
get
to
that.
and
that
is,
if
we
accept
as
a
principle
of
law
what
was
said
in
reynolds,
a
criminal
case
or
whatever,
and
apply
it
to
government
contracting,
where
sophisticated
contractors
are
perfectly
capable
of
negotiating
their
own
contract,
we
are
not
just
throwing
a
monkey
wrench
into
the
gears
of
government
contracting;
we're
throwing
the
whole
monkey.
that's
my
second
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one,
this
isn't
a
case
that
calls
for
it;
and,
two,
the
threat
to
government
contracting
by
changing
from
reynolds
to
here
is
overwhelming.
now,
i
would
like
your
views
on
both
of
those.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
my
problem,
because
when
i
looked
at
reynolds,
reynolds
doesn't
hold
anything
in
your
favor.
it
holds
the
opposite
way.
it
says
to
you,
in
a
criminal
case,
we
said
it
was
unconscionable
for
the
government
both
to
prosecute
and
not
to
--
not
to
tell
them
a
secret,
okay?
and
it
says
such
a
rationale
has
no
application
in
a
civil
forum
where
the
government
is
not
the
moving
party.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
where
the
government
is
the
moving
party.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
exhibit
a
that
it
is
not
unconscionable
here
consists
of
the
two
opinions
of
the
federal
circuit.
i
mean,
now,
what
do
you
want
me
to
read
to
get
over
that
impression?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
didn't
limit
it.
it
said
the
rationale
is
unconscionable.
now,
i
don't
even
have
to
go
that
far.
i
can
go
to
"fundamentally
unfair".
all
i
want
to
know
is
what
should
i
read
to
get
over
my
unfortunate
impression,
which
i
got
out
of
the
two
opinions
that
i
did
read,
that
there
was
nothing
unfair?
okay?
what
do
you
want
me
to
read
to
get
over
that
impression--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
i
think
you
do
want
me
to
read
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
isn't
--
isn't
a
big
practical
problem.
let
me
ask,
then
i
was
--
misimpression.
would
you
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
for
a
minute.
i'm
--
i
--
i
don't
quite
see,
if
you
would
discuss
it
a
little
bit,
how
you
do
this
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
because
the
due
process
clause
is
tied
to
fundamental
unfairness,
and
i
think
the
answer
has
to
be
in
this
kind
of
circumstance
secret
bloc
or
not,
it
depends,
it
depends
on
many
things.
so,
would
you
write
this
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
would
it
--
shouldn't
it
be
written
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
of
contracts?
shouldn't
it
be
written
as
an
exposition
of
the
superior
knowledge
doctrine,
which
seems
totally
open
to
it?
and
--
or
shouldn't
it
be
written
as
a
matter
of
discovery
law,
which
is
what
the
district
judge
who
ended
up
thinking
--
the
court
of
claims
judge
says,
gee,
i
don't
really
know.
i
mean,
that's
how
i
read
it.
how
would
you
--
would
you
speak
about
this
for
a
minute?
