mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
background
checks
are
a
standard
way
of
doing
business.
the
government
has
required
them
for
all
civil
service
employees
since
1953
and
for
contractors
since
2005.
if
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
held
that
a
constitutional
right
to
informational
privacy
precluded
asking
the
questions
it
asks,
that
was
wrong
for
two
basic
reasons.
first,
the
background
checks'
mere
collection
of
information
with
accompanying
safeguards
vitiates
no
constitutional
privacy
interest.
these
checks
have
been
going
on
for
millions
of
employees
for
dozens
of
years.
they
are
part
of
the
employment
process.
they
are
manifestly
not
roving
checks
on
random
individuals.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
--
the
limits
are
--
in
this
case,
are
the
ones
on
sf-85
and
form
42.
and
we
do
think
that
that's
a
fairly
restrict--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
those
two--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
think
that
the
court
doesn't
need
to
confront
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--our
position
is
in
a
case
such
as
this,
where
there
are
collections
on
the
government's
dissemination
of
the
information--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
--
i
think
that
this
court
in
whalen
--
there
is
no
decision
thus
far
that
has
recognized
any
constitutional
limit
on
the
government's
collection
of
information,
so
long
as
there
are
accompanying
safeguards
on
the
disseminations
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--there
--
there
is
no
cross-appeal.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
quite
agree,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
say
to
justice
sotomayor;
that
is,
i
think
that
this
case
doesn't
force
the
court
to
answer
questions
it
has
never
really
answered,
which
are
the
outer
limits
of
what
the
government
can
do
in
terms
of
the
collection
of
information.
here
you
have
a
narrow
decision
by
the
ninth
circuit,
one
whose
reasoning,
i
think,
could
radiate
very
broadly
and
undermine
government
--
the
government's
background
check--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--it's
only
--
it's
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage.
but
our
--
our
point
is
that
the
reasoning
that
the
ninth
circuit
used,
if
adopted
--
if
adopted
to
create
a
permanent
injunction,
could
preclude
the
government
from
asking
all
sorts
of
questions
in
background
--
in
background
checks.
not
just
the
ones
it
isolated
here,
but
more
general
ones,
because
the
ninth
circuit
decision
is
essentially
a
how-to
manual
on
how
to
question
various
individual
questions
and
micromanage
them
and
inject
federal
courts
into--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that's
--
that's
all
that
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
on
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
which
question?
the
drug
treatment
question?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
there's
a
--
the
mandate
has
been
stayed,
so
we
haven't
been
able
to--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
exactly,
justice
kennedy.
and
if
this
court
were
to
embrace
that
reasoning
--
and
this
is
my
answer
to
you,
justice
ginsburg,
as
well
--
then
it
doesn't
just
reach
drug
treatment.
i
could
imagine
other
litigants
doing
it
for
other
forms
of
questions,
whatever
they
may
be.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thus
far,
that's
correct.
but
i
can
imagine
other
litigants
coming
in,
and
maybe
not
just
with
respect
to
these
questions
but
questions
on
sf-85p
or
form
86,
any
number
of
other--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
scalia,
our
position
is
that
the
court
doesn't
need
to
answer
that
question.
it's
just
like
whalen,
because
in
whalen
this
court
assumed
the
existence
of
some
sort
of
constitutional
right
and
then
said:
is
that
right
violated
here?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
agree--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
agree
that
in
many
other
contexts,
it
might
not
be
appropriate,
but
here
i
think
there
are
some
good
reasons
why.
this
court
has
had
special
reticence
to
the
rule
broadly
in
the
range
of
privacy,
and
i
think
the
reason
is
privacy
is
something
that
is
in
flux
in
ways
that
other
things
aren't,
both
in
terms
of
our
social
understandings,
technology,
and
legislation
itself.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
this
court
has
spoken
narrowly
whenever
it's
dealt
with--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
scalia,
that's
what
this
court
has
done
throughout
its
history.
whalen
was
a
unanimous
decision
and
nixon,
on
that
particular
question,
i
don't
think
there
was
a
disagreement
about.
so--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
think
it
would
just
be
like
in
whalen
itself.
so
in
whalen,
the
court
said
there
might
be
some
right
to
informational
privacy,
but
so
long
as
there
are
safeguards
on
the
disclosure,
the
government's
dissemination
of
the
information,
that
means
that
there
is
no--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--no,
that's
not
our
position.
our
position
here
is
that
the
government
can
collect
information
so
long
as
it
is
not
disseminated
in
the
employment
context.
and
this
case,
unlike
whalen,
is
one
that
has
that
added
fact
to
it,
that
the
government
here
is
asking--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
surely
--
we
are
restricted
by
statute,
the
privacy
of--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--if
you
assume--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
if
we
took
out
all
of
the
safeguards
that
are
at
issue
here,
then
the
case
wouldn't
be
like
whalen
or
nixon,
in
which
you
had
those
--
in
which
you
had
safeguards
in
the
dissemination.
and
then
you
would
have
to
confront
the
question,
which
we
think
you
shouldn't
confront
in
this
case,
for
the
reasons
i
said
to
justice
scalia.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
i
mean,
our
position
is
that
the
court
really
shouldn't,
for
all
of
the
reasons
i
said,
get
into
it;
but
if
the
court
had
to
get
into
it,
and
asked,
is
there
some
constitutional
right
that
would
be
violated,
justice
kennedy,
by
your
hypothetical,
our
answer
would
be
no.
but
we
do
think
the
way
that
this
has
been
traditionally
been
handled
is
legislation.
safeguards
for
political--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
in
the
employment/proprietor
context.
okay?
so
if
the
court
had
to
confront
that
question,
it
would
apply
the
matrix
that
justice
scalia
has
talked
about,
the
glucksberg
matrix,
of
whether
a
right
--
the
right
is
firmly
rooted
in
the
traditions
of
the
people,
and
ask:
is
the
government--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
think
there
is
some
right.
the
question
about
whether
it
employs
in
the
unique
employment/proprietor
context
is
one
the
court
hasn't
confronted,
and
our
strong
position
here
is
the
court
shouldn't
confront
it.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
sure.
no,
there
are
limits,
and
i
should
have
said
this
earlier.
if
the
government's
collection
of
information
or
the
disclosure
of
the
information
burdens
some
other
fundamental
constitutional
right,
that
is
certainly
one
limit.
so
if
the
government
were
collecting
information,
justice
alito,
on
sexual
practices
of
its
employees,
it
may
burden
the
exercise
of
other
rights.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
do
think
that
if
the
private
employer
--
the
private
employers
are
a
good
template.
if
the
government
is
simply
mirroring
what
private
employers
do,
as
justice
scalia
said
in
o'connor
v.
ortega,
that's
a
good
suggestion
that
what
it's
doing
is
reasonable.
now,
to
the
extent,
justice
alito,
that
they
are
gradating
far
beyond
what
private
employers
do,
in
terms
of
asking
about
eating
habits
and
the
like,
i
do
think
that
that
may
pose
--
that
there
may
be
some
limits.
the
court
doesn't
need
to
confront
that
here.
it
simply
needs
to
look
at
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
which
recognize
a
broad,
free-standing
right
against
informational
collection
of
its
employees
to
make
sure
and
--
and
realize
that
that
is
a
serious
problem
for
the
way
the
government
does
business.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
absolutely.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it's
certainly
possible,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
all
of
these
hypotheticals
are
enormously
interesting,
but
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
forms
themselves
were
not
approved
by
congress,
but
the
privacy
act,
which
is
the
main
restriction--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that's
absolutely
correct.
the
privacy
act
has
been
around
since
1975
and
the
government
has
collected
--
you
know,
it's
been
used
millions
of
times,
sf-85.
it's
been
used
553,000
times
in
the
last
four
years,
and
we
have
not
seen
the
types
of
disclosure
or
complaints
that
i
think
animate
the
worry
that
my
friends
on
the
other
side
are
saying.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
employee.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
mr.
chief
justice,
the
way
the
question
is
framed
is,
first
they
are
asked,
have
you
used
illegal
drugs
in
the
last
year?
and
then
--
and
then,
if
the
answer
is
yes,
provide
details
and
then
indicate
any
treatment
or
counseling
received.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
that
the
question
itself
is
vague.
now,
the
way
that
the
office
of
personnel
management
will
process
such
a
form
is
it
will
process
anything
so
long
as
there
is
information
about
just
drug
use.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
no.
this
is
unlike,
for
example,
sf-86,
which
does
ask
for
treatment
and
counseling
back
up
to,
i
think,
a
7-year
period.
so
i
think
this
is
a
much
more
narrow
inquiry,
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
inquiry
is
to
help
the
employee.
the
government--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
that's
the
type
--
think
that's
the
type
of
inquiry
that
this
court
rejected
in
whalen.
because
in
whalen,
the
whole
debate
in
the
court
and
the
district
court
below
was,
well,
if
you
want
to
stop
doctor
prescription
mills,
people
providing
too
many
narcotics,
you
don't
need
the
names
and
ages
of
the
patients.
we
could
change
the
triplicate
forms
and
redact
that.
but
what
this
court
said
on
the
second
page
of
its
opinion
was
it
called
that
lochnerian,
that
federal
courts
shouldn't
be
policing
forms
and
excising
or
suggesting
random
different
--
you
know,
a
few
different
words
here
or
there.
and
here,
experts
put
this
form
together
to
try
and
get
at,
basically,
are
you
using
drugs
and
are
you
using
treatment
which
might
ameliorate
the
fact
that
you
had
used
illegal
drugs
in
the
last
year.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
correct.
and
in
preparation
for
this
we
did
survey
all
of
the
nasa
different
centers
to
ask,
has
treatment
ever
been
used
in
any
sort
of
way
to
hurt
an
employee?
and
the
answer
that
came
back
was,
no,
it
has
not
been
used.
it
has
only
been
used
to
help.
it
is
to
retain
someone
who
did
use
illegal
drugs,
but
is
taking
steps
to
mitigate.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
the
process
by
which
this
takes
place
is
the
form
is
filled
out.
it's
ultimately
sent
to
an
adjudicator
if
there
is
negative
information,
and
that
--
and
that
information
is
then
discussed
with
the
candidate
for
employment
or
the
employee
to
see
if
they
have
an
explanation.
and
of
the
times
that
this
has
happened,
that
someone
has
been
denied,
and
i
think
the
number
is
128
times
over
the
--
over
the
last
five
years,
none
have
been
denied
for
a
positive
answer
to
drug
treatment.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
for
federal
contractors.
that
is
correct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
yes.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
128
times,
the
sf-85
process,
is
my
understanding,
has
been
used
to
deny
someone
a
credential
of
the
federal
contractor--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--for
anything.
exactly.
about
--
and
i
think
there
have
been
about
74,000
contractors
that
have
sought
badges
through
the
sf-85,
so--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
is
correct.
that
is
part
of
--
that
is
part
of
the
regulations
that
are
in
place,
so
that
if
someone
is
denied
a
credential
--
and
this
is,
i
think,
at
joint
appendix,
page
180
--
they
are
told
the
reason
for
that
denial.
they
are
given
an
opportunity
to
explain
themselves,
and
a
process
is
then
put
in
place.
there
is
then
also
robust
appeal
and
other
things
that
may
happen
as
well.
but
one
thing
that
doesn't
happen,
justice
sotomayor,
is
that
jpl,
the
contractor,
is
not
told
the
basis
for
why
the
person
is
denied
a
credential.
that
is,
it's
private
as
between
the
government
--
here,
nasa
--
and
the
individual
employee.
and
that
is
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--it
doesn't.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it
doesn't.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i'm
representing
that
nasa
has
--
nasa
will
not
and
does
not
use
this
employment
--
employee
suitability
chart
to
make
contractor
credentialing
decisions.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
it's
--
it's
been
hard
to
actually
pin
down
where
it
came
from.
i
think
it
is
derived
from
earlier
office
of
personnel
management
materials
at
a
time
when
it
listed
out
what
various
crimes
were.
and
so
some
of
those
things
that
are
on
there
that
are
quite
salacious
are
things
that
opm,
at
earlier
points
in
time,
looked
to,
not
for
contractors,
but
for
government
employees.
but
i
can
represent
to
the
court
that
nasa
does
not
and
will
not
use
this
chart
for
credentialing
decisions.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
ginsburg,
i
quite
agree
with
you.
i
don't
think
that
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
is
capable
of
being
ameliorated
easily.
so
we
talked
before
about
how
the
drug
treatment
was
just
a
narrow
part
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
but
this
form
42,
the
invalidation
of
form
42,
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
the
government
does
all
the
time
and
what
all
employers
do.
they
ask
open-ended
questions
to
figure
out
whether
someone
is
trustworthy
and
reliable.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
as
judge
kleinfeld
said,
that's
how
law
clerks
are
hired.
that's
how
baristas
at
starbucks
are
hired.
you
have
to
ask
these
open-ended
questions
because
as
an
employer,
you
don't
really
know
what
--
where
the
pressure
points
or
danger
spots
in
an
individual
application
are.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
not
what
we're
saying.
we--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
sotomayor,
the
narrow
rule
is
what
we
said
in
our
petition
and
what
we
said
on
the
very
last
page
of
our
reply
brief
and
all
throughout,
which
is,
this
court
should
simply
say
what
it
said
in
whalen,
which
is
assuming
that
there
is
some
informational
right
to
informational
privacy.
the
--
the
use
of
a
background
check
with
accompanying
safeguards
to
collect
information
doesn't
violate
the
constitutional
right
to
privacy.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
could
imagine
a
circumstance
far
afield
from
this
one
in
which
the
government's
just
mere
collection
of
information
about
sexual
practices
might
burden
the
exercise
of
those
rights.
i'm
saying
it's
not
at
all
present
here,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
should
get
into
it.
but
that's
a
really
different
question
than
the
one
here,
which
is:
is
there
some
free-standing
right
to
constitutional
privacy
that
is
unburdened
by
the
fact
that
there
are
protections
against
the
disclosure
of
information?
here,
the
privacy
act
imposes
strong
protections
against
the
disclosure
of
information.
and
so
what's
left
is
a
very
residual
interest
in
the
part
of
the
employees.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
could
imagine
an
as-applied
challenge
to,
for
example,
you
know,
the
hypothetical
on
sexual
practices
or
whatever.
i
do
think,
as
justice
scalia
said,
the
real
check
on
that
is
the
political
process
check.
the
fact
is
that
the
government
doesn't
ask
those
kinds
of
questions,
and
to
the
extent
it
ever
did,
the
court
could
confront
that
in
an
as-applied
challenge.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
those
questions,
justice
ginsburg,
are
really
the
heart
of
the
form.
i
mean,
those
are
the
most
--
in
many
ways
the
most
important
questions,
because
they're
the
ones
that
employers
have
to
ask
because
they
don't
know
the
weaknesses
in
an
individual
applicant's
background.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
yes,
i
would
say
a
few
things.
number
one
is
i
think
that
the
--
the
concurring
judge
did,
i
think,
underestimate
how
important
security
is
there.
first
of
all,
there
are
armed
guards
when
you
are
coming
in.
it
is
not
the
campus-like
atmosphere.
it's
not
like
a
campus
that
i'm
familiar
that
she
described.
the
information
at
the
debate
at
jpl
is
sensitive,
quite
sensitive,
both,
you
know,
in
terms
of
scientifically
and
with
respect
to
our
nation's
secrets.
and
the
even
more
important
point
about
this
is
the
badge
that
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
access
to
don't
--
doesn't
just
give
them
access
to
jpl.
it
will
also
give
them
other
access
to
all
other
nasa
facilities.
and
it's
such
an
important
credential
that
it
would
allow
them
to
get
within,
for
example,
6
to
10
feet
of
the
space
shuttle
as
it
is
being
repaired
and
readied
for
launch.
so
this
is
a
credential
not
just
for
jpl
and
getting
onto
jpl,
but
other
places
as
well.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
ginsburg,
you
had
asked
earlier
whether
this
was
narrow
decision
on
just
a
couple
of
questions
and
i
think
that
the
argument
that
you
just
heard
from
my
friend
illustrates
that
it
is
not.
he
asks
for
a
"free
standing
right
to
control".
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
the
judgment--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
the
judgment
is
based
on
the
following
rationale,
this
is
from
the
petition
appendix
on
page
18a
from
the
ninth
circuit.
"if
the
government's
actions
compel
disclosure
of
private
information,
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
its
use
of
the
information
would
advance
a
legitimate
state
interest
and
that
its
actions
are
narrowly
tailored
to
meet
the
legitimate
interest.
"
now,
that
reasoning
was
used
to
invalidate
a
question,
as
justice
kennedy
said
on
form
42,
that
employers
ask
all
the
time,
banks
ask
it
and
the
like.
and
it's
a
--
it's
used
to
invalidate
parts
of
a
standard
form
that
the
government
uses
day
in
and
day
out
and
that
employers
generally
use
in
order
to
make
employment
decisions.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
no,
we
are
not
conceding
that
at
all.
i
do
think
we
would
meet
the
standard,
but
our
point
is
it's
the
same
point
as
in
engquist,
in
the
chief
justices's
opinion
in
engquist
v.
oregon.
forcing
the
government
to
have
to
march
into
court
every
time
to
justify
a
question
here
or
an
employee
there
or
soup
clerk
here
or
whatever,
all
of
those
different
inquiries
pose
practical
burdens
on
the
ability
of
the
government
to
operate.
and
so--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
think
that
political
process
ensures
that
the
government
generally
has
to
answer
that
question
at
large,
but
in
order
for
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
to
apply
it
would
permit
any
individual
person
here
or
there
to
ask
the
question.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
only
because--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that's
only
because
the
petitioners
here
only
challenged
certain
questions.
i
could
imagine
other
petitioners
challenging
other
questions.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
drug
use
piece,
but
i
could
imagine
all
sorts
of
inquires
about
other
aspects
of
the
form
and
indeed
the
rationale,
the
language
that
i
just
read
to
you
is
a
road
map
for
anyone
to
be
able
to
come
in
and
say,
well,
this
question
isn't
necessary
for
me
because
i
got
a
background
clearance
before
and
i'm
rehired
or
whatever.
and
it
would
be
a
huge
practical
burden
in
the
same
way
as
recognizing
the
cause
of
action
in
engquist
was
a
practical
burden.
instead
we
think
what
the
court
should
do
here
is
what
it
did
in
whalen,
which
is
recognize
governments
collect
information
all
the
time.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
information
which
can
be
collected
that
is
released
here
is
governed
by
the
privacy
act.
and
so
there
are,
the
appendix
to
our
brief
lists
out
precisely
to
who
they
could
be
released
to,
and
that
has
been
around
since
1975.
we
have
seen
virtually
no
complaints
about
the
government
disclosing
this
type
of
background
information
on
sf-85.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
if
it
is
for,
if
it
is
to
further
the
government
purpose
for
which
the
information
is
collected
it
can
be
distributed
to
other
folks
in
the
government.
there
are
restrictions
on
that
and
they
are
specified
in
the
privacy
act
and
they
are
quite
extensive.
to
the
extent
that
the
court
is
concerned
that
there
is
something
that
isn't
robust
enough
in
the
privacy
act,
we
suggest
that
can
wait
for
an
as-applied
challenge
down
the
road
when
information
is
disclosed.
we
don't
think
it
will,
but
if
heaven
forbid
that
happens,
that's
a
basis
for
the
as-applied
challenge
down
the
road.
but
here
what
they
are
asking
you
to
do
is
invalidate
questions
and
forms
that
the
government
asks
all
of
it's
employees
and
now
just
wants
to
ask
contractors.
thank
you.
