justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
your
view
of
what
the
liberty
--
you
are
saying
that
the
words
in
the
constitution
that
protect
the
right
that
you
claim
was
violated
are
the
words,
"no
person
shall
be"
--
i
guess
--
"deprived
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
"
i
guess
you
mean
the
word
"liberty".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
in
your
words,
it
is
liberty
--
define
it.
liberty
to
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
a
right
to
liberty
to
control
information
about
oneself?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
all
information?
some
information?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
liberty
--
there
is
a
liberty
to
control
all
information?
protected
from
--
from
what?
from
the
state?
the
state
doesn't
have
a
right
to
give
you
any
--
get
any
information
about
you?
on
a
driver's
license?
it's
--
when
does
it
come
into
play?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
fact
that
the
government
says
--
i
go
and
i
want
my
driver's
license,
and
they
say,
fill
out
the
form,
we
want
to
see
how
you
--
if
you
can
drive
or
not,
that
potentially
could
violate
the
constitution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
potentially.
it
might
not,
because
it
might
be
justified,
but
each
such
case
would
have
to
be
justified.
is
that
--
is
that
your
theory?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
"liberty".
the
liberty,
you
said,
was
liberty
to
control
information
about
yourself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
want
to
know
how
that
works.
every
time
anyone
in
the
government
asks
a
question
about
you
personally,
of
course,
it
wouldn't
be
unconstitutional.
but
every
time
it
would
have
to
be
a
justified
thing;
is
that
--
is
that
your
theory?
i'm
just
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
do
we
decide?
i
am
a
little
interested,
if
you
could
spend
two
or
three
minutes
elaborating
this.
a
number
of
laws,
federal
laws,
i
imagine
the
regulations
fill
this
room,
and
i
think
many
--
maybe
more,
maybe
several
rooms.
and
many
of
them
involve
asking
people
for
information.
and
the
number
of
forms
that
ask
people
for
information,
i
guess,
about
themselves,
might
fill
several
rooms.
and
i
can
imagine
in
a
country
of
300
million
people,
you
would
find
someone
objecting
to
many
of
the
questions.
and
so
how
is
the
system
supposed
to
work,
in
your
view,
where
judges
will
decide
whether
a
particular
question
--
i'm
not
saying
you
are
wrong.
i
just
wanted
to
get
an
idea
from
you
as
to
how
this
legal
system
works,
where
any
question
asked
by
the
government
about
a
person
is
potentially
subject
to
challenge
as
unconstitutional.
you
and
i
will
agree
that
many
are
fine.
but
you
are
worried
about
some
that
aren't
fine.
how
does
it
work,
the
system,
distinguishing
the
ones
from
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
view
on
that
question?
there
is
a
famous,
funny
example
that
supposedly
may
be
untrue.
senator
hruska
used
to
ask
and
say
in
giving
a
reference
he
would
write
about
someone,
you'll
be
lucky
if
you
can
get
smith
to
work
for
you.
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
might
want
to
know.
and
despite
the
ambiguity
there
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
question
7
sort
of
drove
at
that.
and
so,
but
they
did
enjoin
it,
so
in
your
view,
is
that
aspect
of
the
injunction
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right
then.
well,
then,
if
it's
right,
why
is
it
right?
because
it
seems
to
me
the
basic
thing
any
employer
would
want
to
know
is
whether
i'm
lucky
to
get
this
person
to
work
for
me,
that
kind
of
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
specific
thing
about
question
7
that
you
think
is
unlawful
or
should
be
changed?
what
words
do
you
object
to
in
that
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
cannot
ask,
do
you
have
any
information
about
this
person's
employment,
residence,
or
activities
concerning
general
behavior
or
conduct
or
other
matters?
now,
i
am
an
employer
and
i
would
like
to
find
out
if
he's
going
to
do
a
good
job.
so
what
am
i
supposed
to
say,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
place
here
other
than
that
to
get
into
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see,
i
see.
