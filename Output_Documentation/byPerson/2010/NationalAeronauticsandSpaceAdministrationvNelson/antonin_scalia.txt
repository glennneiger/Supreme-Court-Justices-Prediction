justice

scalia
mr.
katyal,
what
is
the
well-defined,
the
well-defined,
constitutional
right
to
institutional
--
to
informational
privacy
that
the
government
is
--
is
willing
to
acknowledge?
you
--
you
apparently
don't
--
don't
challenge
the
existence
of
such
a
constitutional
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
strange
way
to
proceed.
we
normally
don't
do
that,
see?
if
there
were
a
constitutional
right,
would
it
cover
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
do
that
in
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
justify
not
defining
it
broadly
or
narrowly.
it
wouldn't
justify
not
reaching
the
question
of
whether
there
is
any
such
constitutional
right
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
do
have
a
legislature,
don't
we,
that
could
place
some
limits
on
what
the
government
asks
employees
or
anybody
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
same
legislature
that
prohibited
the
government
from
disclosing
a
lot
of
information,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
possible
that
that's
the
protection
that
the
framers
envisioned,
rather
than
having
courts
ride
herd
on
government
inquiries.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stormer,
what
provision
of
the
constitution
are
you
relying
--
i
looked
at
your
table
of
authorities
in
your
brief,
and
you
have
cases
listed,
you
have
statutes
listed;
there
is
not
a
single
citation
anywhere
in
your
brief
to
a
provision
of
the
constitution.
what
provision
of
the
constitution
are
you
relying
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
a
very
nice
thing
that
the
government
shouldn't
ask
intrusive
questions.
i
also
think
that
it's
a
nice
thing
that
the
government
should
pay
a
living
wage
to
its
employees,
but
i
don't
feel
authorized
to
go
around
saying
how
much
the
government
should
pay
each
of
its
employees
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
about
that,
and
the
question
is
left
to
congress.
what
do
you
rely
on
in
the
constitution
that
enables
me
to
decide
how
much
intrusiveness
is
too
much,
rather
than
leaving
that
to
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
fifth
amendment,
okay.
which
says
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
due
process
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
that
--
that's
what
i
thought.
you
are
talking
about
substantive
due
process
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
like
that,
but
i
just
don't
see
it
anywhere
in
the
constitution.
that's
all
i'm
taking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
can
handle
those
details.
my
goodness,
it's
all
right
there
in
the
constitution.
and
we
can
decide
what
--
what
employees
have
to
know
what,
and
what
questions
you
can
ask
them,
and
how
much
privacy
is
too
much
privacy,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
piece
of
cake.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
your
friend
said
that
the
badge
enables
you
to
get
within
10
feet
of
the
shuttle?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
contradict
that?
and
if
it's
so,
how
can
you
say
that
these
people
are
low-risk
employees?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
al-qaeda
know
all
this
stuff?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
al-qaeda
know
this?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
a
private
employer
could
not
ask
a
question
of
such
detail?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
could
a
private
employer
not
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
mean
that
legislatures
take
care
of
these
matters?
i
find
it
curious
that
in
order
to
establish
a
federal
constitutional
right,
which
turns
this
area
over
to
this
court,
you
invoke
laws
that
have
been
democratically
enacted
by
state
legislatures.
if
indeed
that's
the
criterion,
maybe
you
don't
need
us.
