justice
ruth
bader

general
katyal,
why
are
we
getting
into
this?
because
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
challenge
--
a
challenge
to
a
preliminary
injunction
which
was
quite
narrow.
there
was
only
one
question
at
issue.
there
is
no
cross-appeal,
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
have
form
85.
the
only
thing
that's
in
contention
there
is
the
question
about
treatment
or
counsel.
nothing
else.
so
why
are
we
talking
about
the
universe
of
what
questions
might
be
asked?
and
on
the
other
form,
i
take
it,
it's
just
the
so-called
open-ended
questions,
not
everything
on
the
form.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
think
has
been
--
there
hasn't
been
a
formal
injunction
entered,
a
preliminary
--
a
preliminary
junction,
has
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
--
the
entire
form
85
was
approved.
there's
no
questions
you
could
ask
about,
have
you
used
drugs
within
the
last
year?
it's
only
the
question
about
treatment
and
counseling
that
is
at
issue.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
--
the
circuit
precedent,
as
far
as
the
other
questions
on
form
85,
the
circuit
said
that's
okay.
it's
permissible
to
ask
those
questions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
answer
to
that
is
obvious.
it
was
raised
by
the
other
side.
if
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
employee,
make
it
voluntary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
it
come
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
--
do
you
have
a
clear
idea
of
how
the
form
42
would
have
to
be
amended
if
the
respondents
are
correct?
form
85,
we
know
we
excise
"counseling
or
treatment".
what
in
the
form
85
did
the
ninth
circuit
say?
it
said
"open-ended
questions",
but
i
looked
at
the
form
and
it
is
not
clear
to
me
which
ones
they
considered
open-ended.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
still
don't
see
why
that
--
why
this
is
before
us,
because
the
ninth
circuit
said
some
of
this
form
is
okay,
most
of
form
85
is
okay,
and
some
of
form
42
is
okay.
i
thought
it
was
only
the
questions
under
7
and
8,
the
open-ended
questions.
i
didn't
think
the
ninth
circuit
had
enjoined
anything
other
than
those
questions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that
question,
that
kind
of
open-ended
question,
routinely
used
in
employment
situations?
that
is,
the
employer
wants
to
know:
is
there
any
adverse
information
about
this
person?
doesn't
know
which
question
to
ask,
because
there's
a
whole
--
many
things
that
could
be
relevant.
so
are
you
suggesting
that
that
kind
of
question
is
off-limits
to
the
government,
although
it
is
routinely
used
in
other
employment
sectors?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
has
a
legend
on
the
top.
everything
that
we
are
asking
you
is
meant
to
--
to
determine
suitability
for
employment.
so
they
want
to
find
out
information
relevant
to
suitability
for
employment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
then
saying
that
these
people
have
to
be
grandfathered
or
grandparented
because
they
worked
for
20
years--
[laughter]
--without--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
are
making
a
--
you
said
that
these
people
have
worked
there
for
20
years.
are
they
different
from
the
new
employee?
are
you
suggesting
it's
okay
for
the
new
employee,
but
not
okay--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
the
person
who
is
already
in
the
job?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
that
this
is
no
good
for
government
employment?
you
were
dealing
with
a
contractor
here,
but
this
form,
as
i
understand
it,
has
been
used
for
--
for
many
years
for
standard
government
employment.
is
it
--
are
they
okay?
and
for
nonsensitive
positions,
are
you
--
are
you
arguing
just
government
contractor
or
are
you
saying
even
for
the
government
employee,
the
person
who's
hired
to
work
at
the
snack
bar
in
the
senate,
let's
say,
the
government
can't
ask
these
questions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
--
you
are
attacking
these
forms
for
all
government
employment,
not
just
the
contractors?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
--
i'm
very
surprised
to
hear
that.
i
thought
that
--
that
if
there
were
in
--
in
the
private
sector
similar
questions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
it
say
you
have
to
turn
over
your
medical
records?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
i
ask
you
to
clarify
your
understanding
of
what
has
been
enjoined?
we
know
form
85,
but
form
42,
you
mentioned
the
releases.
i
thought
that
the
ninth
circuit's
order
covers
lots
of
question
7
and
perhaps
question
8,
i
didn't
see,
is
there
something,
maybe
i
missed
it,
that
says
they
can
ask
for
release
of
the
records?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
didn't
say,
government,
you
can't
ask
for
the
release?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
say
you
can't
ask
open-ended
questions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
somebody
is
going
to
be
enjoined,
i
mean,
it
can't
be
implicit
in
the
ruling
if
you
were
enjoined.
because
it
has
been
stayed
you
don't
have
a
formal
order,
but
you
can't
say,
well,
it
is
implicit
in
the
how
many
page
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understand
this
process,
this
is
not
an
oral
interview.
you
fill
out
a
form,
you
meet
somebody
and
they
ask
follow-up
questions.
this
is
--
this
handles
on
the
papers,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but
is
there
an
oral
interview
in
this
process?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
they
wouldn't
say
--
it
says
here,
so
i'm
going
to
ask
this,
that
and
the
other
thing.
it's
a
written--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whatever
he
asks,
we
were
reviewing
a
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
judgment
is
not
the
universe,
it's
certain
questions
can
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
how
that's
so
because
at
least
if
you
are
in
the
ninth
circuit,
you
know
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
blessed
all
the
questions
on
that
form
but
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
could
raise
the
question,
but
you
would
be
out
of
court
in
a
minute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
they
did
in
the
lower
court,
but
abandoned
it
here
challenging
the
question
about
the
drug
use?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
also
within
the
government
itself?
i
know
the
privacy
act
is
the
government
can't
disclose,
but
how
about
checks
and
when
you
have
a
back
government
or
checks
about
circulating
the
information
within
the
government?
