mr.
katyal,
is
there
any
limit
to
what
questions
the
government
can
ask--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--an
applicant?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
does
that
mean?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
ask
somebody,
what's
your
genetic
make-up,
because
we
don't
want
people
with
a
gene
that
is
predisposed
to
cancer?
whatever
other
--
could
you
ask
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
do,
because
i
have
to
start
with
the
question
of:
what
are
the
limits
on
the
government,
if
any?
are
you
taking
the
position
that
as
an
employer,
there
are
absolutely
none,
or
are
you
taking
the
position
that
there
are
some,
and
what
would
they
be?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
you
are
saying
is,
there
is
no
limit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
were
these
two
forms
approved
by
congress?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
restriction
on
disclosure,
but
the
same
congress
can
change
that,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
answer.
only
128
times
has
somebody
identified
themselves
as
a
drug
user?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
could
be
for
any
other
answers
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
representing
to
us
that
every
employee
who
is
rejected
will
know
the
reason?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
where
does
the
suitability
matrix
come
in?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
doesn't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
nasa
has
never
used
it?
you're
representing
that
to
the
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general
--
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead
and
finish.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
your
position
today
that
our
ruling
should
say
that
the
government
is
free
to
ask,
as
a
private
employer
or
contractor
--
it
is
free
to
ask
any
question
it
wants
whatsoever?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
you
were
not
saying
that,
then
what
is
the
narrower
ruling?
because
that's
what
i
thought
i
heard
at
the
beginning
of
our
colloquy
today.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
why
wouldn't
that
violate
it
if
the
question
involved
a
fundamental
right?
if
you
were
asking
the
question
that
justice
alito
asked,
which
is,
what's
your
sexual
practices
in
the
bedroom,
if
there
are
security
checks
against
you
disclosing
it,
you
are
saying
even
that
would
be
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
don't
--
this
is
a
bit
unsatisfying.
because
you
start
by
saying
to
us,
as
long
as
there
are
some
nondisclosure
protections,
then
virtually
any
question,
whether
it
impinges
a
fundamental
right
or
not,
would
be
okay,
because
there's
--
i
don't
even
know
what
the
government's
interest
is
in
asking
every
question
it
wants
to.
there
has
to
be
a
need
for
a
set
of
questions,
doesn't
there?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
right
is
subject
to
what
level
of
scrutiny?
is
it
always
strict
scrutiny?
and
how
do
you
square
whalen
and
nixon's
balancing
with
strict
scrutiny?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that's
all
information
about
yourself?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
what
justice
breyer
is
getting
to
and
that
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is,
you've
used
the
word
"privacy".
what
does
privacy
relate
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i'm
talking
about
--
answer
his
broad
question,
which
is
--
you've
defined
the
constitutional
right
to
information
about
yourself.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
all
information
about
yourself,
including
your
date
of
birth,
your
social
security
number,
your
--
where
you
live,
where
you've
gone
to
school,
who
are
your
friends,
who
your
references
are?
because
as
broadly
as
you
have
defined
that,
it
would
include
all
of
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
fundamental
rights
issue
that
the
sixth
amendment
identified,
are
those
the
questions
that
are
subject
to
that
greater
scrutiny?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
conceding
you
can't
meet
that
standard
or
are
you
saying
that
the
ninth
circuit
misapplied
that
standard?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
government
having
to
explain
why
it
seeks
information?
i
mean,
i
would
think
that
would
be
fairly
simple
in
virtually
every
situation.
i
ask
that
question
because
that
begs
the
question
of
can
you
ask
anything
you
want
regardless
of
why?
