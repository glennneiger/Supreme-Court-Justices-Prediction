mr.
dan
stormer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
as
now
characterized
is
really
how
far
may
a
government
go,
may
this
government
go,
to
intrude
into
the
private
lives
of
its
citizens,
both
in
positions
that
do
not
involve
sensitive
issues,
classified
issues,
national
security
issues,
or
positions
of
public
trust?
mr.
dan
stormer
it
would
mostly
fall--
mr.
dan
stormer
--it
would
flow
from
the
ordered
concept
of
the
liberty
component
of
the
fifth
amendment,
as
well
as
the
first--
mr.
dan
stormer
--of
life
--
i
mean,
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
due
process
of
law,
and
then
the
last--
mr.
dan
stormer
--refers
to
the
concept
of,
the
ordered
concept
of
liberty.
mr.
dan
stormer
well,
the
whalen
case,
the
nixon
case,
and
to
some
extent,
the
reporters
committee
case
refer
to
this
concept
of
privacy.
and
they
are,
in
fact,
vague,
but
they
do
talk
about
the
concept
of
privacy
as
being
the
right
to
control
information
about
oneself.
and
--
and
both
--
and
all
of
the--
mr.
dan
stormer
--well,
i
--
there
--
those
cases,
in
fact,
do
not
refer
to
a
term
called
"informational
privacy".
those
terms
have
grown
from
the
various
cases
that
have
flown
--
flowed
from
the
determinations
in
whalen
and
nixon
and,
to
some
extent,
reporters
committee.
mr.
dan
stormer
the
--
the
standard
would
be
--
i
think
the
appropriate
standard
was
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit,
which
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
narrowly
tailored
to
meet
that
need.
in
this
case,
there
is
some
--
like
the
von
raab
case,
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
which
is
a
fourth
amendment
case,
the
--
this
court
used
a
compelling
state
interest
standard
for
a
fourth
amendment
invasion.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
remanded
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
positions
involved
classified
or
sensitive
materials.
mr.
dan
stormer
that's
correct.
mr.
dan
stormer
liberty
to
control
information
about
oneself.
the
liberty
to--
mr.
dan
stormer
--without
governmental
intrusion.
mr.
dan
stormer
well
there--
mr.
dan
stormer
--it
comes
into
play
when
the
government,
the
state,
seeks
to
intrude
and
obtain
information
from
an
individual.
the
--
the--
mr.
dan
stormer
--well--
mr.
dan
stormer
--any
intrusion
into
private
lives
would
have
to
have
some--
mr.
dan
stormer
--that
was
the--
mr.
dan
stormer
--that
--
yes,
it
is.
mr.
dan
stormer
well--
mr.
dan
stormer
--privacy
relates,
in
this
case,
to
the--
mr.
dan
stormer
--correct.
mr.
dan
stormer
it
--
the
--
the
nature
of
what
is
included
can
be
intruded
upon
based
upon
a
governmental
need.
so
if
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
knowing
social
security
numbers,
driver's
license,
census
information,
that
type
of
information,
then
--
then
there
is
not
an
issue.
mr.
dan
stormer
the
test--
mr.
dan
stormer
--in
this
case,
i
think
it
is
a
legitimate
state
interest,
narrowly
tailored
to
meet
that
interest,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
stormer
yes.
mr.
dan
stormer
well,
this
court
has
done
much
of
that
already
in
a
whole
history
of
cases:
contraception,
procreation,
marriage,
sexual
relations,
family
relations.
mr.
dan
stormer
the
--
the
rights
that
go
--
the
questions
that
go
to
those
types
of
--
which
could
elicit
that
type
of
information.
for
instance,
on
form
42,
if
they
said,
tell
us
any
adverse
information
you
have
about
this
person,
which
includes
any
other
matters.
this
could
be
--
they
could
respond
with
saying,
"well,
i
don't
like
the
way
he
--
how
many
kids
he
has.
"
"i
don't
like
his
religion.
"
"i
don't
like
his
sexual
practices.
"
mr.
dan
stormer
it
is
not
routinely
used
in
employment
sectors
where
there
is
allowed
to
inquiry
--
inquiry
into
non-employment-related--
mr.
dan
stormer
--and
for
security
clearances.
those
are
the
two
issues.
mr.
dan
stormer
that
would
be
exactly
my
point,
your
honor.
it
is
in
those
situations
where
there's
sensitive
issues,
you
are
allowed
to
inquire
based
on
the
need.
but
here,
they
are
inquiring
the
snack
bar
worker,
the
--
the
bus
driver,
the
gift
shop
operator,
are
--
are
required
to
respond
to
these
questions.
the
gs-4
interior
department
clerk.
the
government's
position
is
all
of
those
are
subject
to
this
same
type
of
inquiry.
mr.
dan
stormer
this
goes
to
the
very
basic
question
of:
why
does
the
government
need
to
know
this
information
for
these
individuals,
most
of
whom
have
been
there
for
20
to
30
years?
the
government
can't
show
a
single
instance
of
any
of
these
individuals
doing
anything
that
would
require
any
of
the
type
of
scrutiny--
mr.
dan
stormer
--i
am
not,
your
honor.
but
the
government
has
some
burden
to
show
that
--
a
need
to
inquire
into
these
privacy
areas.
it
needs
to
know
if
you
have
gone
to
the
betty
ford--
mr.
dan
stormer
--i
am
not.
mr.
dan
stormer
i
--
i
am
not.
the
--
the
difference
between
this
case
and,
ultimately,
what
was
allowed
in
both
whalen
and
nixon
--
excuse
me,
particularly
in
whalen
--
is
that
there
was
some
overarching
societal
need
to
have
this
information.
mr.
dan
stormer
i
would
agree
that
--
that
in
that
instance,
"i
hope
the
space
shuttle
blows
up.
"
would
certainly
implicate
some
first
amendment
issues,
but
the
government
should
know
that
information.
mr.
dan
stormer
i
wouldn't
think
that
that
would
be
needed.
i
think
that--
mr.
dan
stormer
--only
if
you
need
to
know
the
answers.
and
for
the
snack
bar
worker
or
the
gs
clerk-typist,
for
those
types
of
people
who
have
no
access
to
sensitive
information,
do
not
--
it
can
--
the
definition
here
is
that
these
are
noor
low-risk
--
they
are
low-risk
employees,
which
is
defined
as,
if
they
misuse
their
position,
they
will
have
little
or
no
impact
on
the
agency
mission.
so
we
know
that
these
questions
are
being
asked
of
people
who,
if
they
completely
misused
their
position,
there
will
be
no
impact.
mr.
dan
stormer
it
does.
mr.
dan
stormer
it
--
it
can
to
the
positions.
this
--
this
--
what
is
being
done
now,
if
they
have
done
70,000
inquiries,
that
means
--
and
128
issues
arose,
that
means
a
whole
host
of
people,
over
69,000
people,
have
had
to
give
up
information
that
otherwise
they
would
not
have
to
give
up.
mr.
dan
stormer
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
and
i
apologize,
i
--
i
think
this
cannot
be
asked
of
--
these
questions
cannot
be
asked
of
people
for
whom
the
government
does
not
have
a
justifiable
need
to
know
that
information.
mr.
dan
stormer
well--
mr.
dan
stormer
--the
government
is
--
claims
to
be
acting
as
the
employer
here.
in
fact,
it
is
not.
it
is
--
it's
once
or
twice
removed.
but
assuming
that
the
government
is
the
employer,
there
is
a
massive
amount
of
waste
that
is
generated
by
this
form.
mr.
dan
stormer
i
--
i
don't
--
it
--
i
think
it
would
apply
to
all
of
those
people
who
are
in
nonsensitive
positions.
this
is
the
government's
definition,
it's
not
our
definition.
we
chose
the
government's
definition.
and
if
it
is
a
low-risk
or
a
no-risk
employee,
then
the
government
doesn't
have
a
need
to
know.
a
private
employer
could
not--
mr.
dan
stormer
--in
the
context
of
these
employees
for
this
particular
case,
we
absolutely
know,
because
the
government
went
through
and
of
the
7,500
employees
there,
it
categorized
97
percent
as
low
or
no-risk
employees.
so,
we
know
in
this
context
where
they
are
already
employed
and
it's
just
a
badging
procedure.
what
the
government
did
here--
mr.
dan
stormer
--i
don't
know
that
for
a
fact.
i
do
know
that--
mr.
dan
stormer
--because
the
government
says
they
are
low
or
no-risk
employees.
this
is
a
campus
atmosphere.
i
have
been
there.
i
have
seen
it.
if
you
want
--
if
i
want
to
go
on,
i
just
call
up
dr.
nelson
and
say,
can
you
get
me
on?
if
i'm
on
there,
and
my
car
breaks
down
and
i
call
up
and
say
can
the
aaa
auto
come
on,
i
just
call
the
gate
and
the
aaa
auto
person,
they
say,
yeah,
just
let
him
in?
the
--
the
people
who
have
--
bring
supplies
on
they
just
come
on.
this
is
a
campus
where
they
don't
have--
mr.
dan
stormer
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
dan
stormer
well,
the
interesting
response
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
it
wouldn't
matter
if
they
knew
this,
because
it's
open
transparent
science
by
a
civilian
agency
in
a
campus
atmosphere.
this
is
not
a
--
weapons,
national
security--
mr.
dan
stormer
--and
the
government
has
a
form
for
those
people
who
work
in
classified
information.
that's
sf-85p,
sf-85s
and
sf-86.
the
government
can
standardize
and
when
it
acts
as
the
employer,
it
has
an
obligation,
because
it
can't
take
both
it's
ability
and
authority
as
the
government
and
--
and
overreach
into
the
private
lives
of
its
citizens.
the
questions
that
are
being
asked
here
would
not
be
allowed
for
private
employers--
mr.
dan
stormer
--similar
but
not
questions
that
would
go
--
you
couldn't,
as
a
private
employer,
say
you
have
to
turn
over
your
medical
records,
you
have
to
turn
over--
mr.
dan
stormer
--that's
in
sf
--
sf-85
page
6,
which
is
the
release.
and
all
of
this
has
to
be
inquired
into--
mr.
dan
stormer
--in
the
state
of
california
in
the
right
to
privacy.
mr.
dan
stormer
most
--
general
federal
law,
i
cannot
answer
that.
mr.
dan
stormer
yes
--
well,
in
some
states
there's
a
--
where
there's
a
privacy
right.
mr.
dan
stormer
they
can't
ask
the
question--
mr.
dan
stormer
--in
the
context
of
the
release
which
is
sf-85
page
6,
which
requires
that
you
release
your
private
records,
extensive
records,
residential,
retail
businesses,
where
you
shop,
your
educational,
your--
mr.
dan
stormer
--i
--
i
--
if
i
said
that,
your
honor,
i
misspoke.
the
question
goes--
mr.
dan
stormer
--it
was.
mr.
dan
stormer
question
7
talks
about
financial
integrity,
mental
and
emotional
stability,
general
--
general
behavior
or
conduct
or
other
matters.
if
a
private
employer,
in
many
states,
goes
into
non-employment-related
issues,
it's
--
it's
contrary
to--
mr.
dan
stormer
--no.
mr.
dan
stormer
any
employer
can
ask
issues
that
are
employment
related
and
based
upon
the
nature
of
the
job.
you
can
ask
those
questions,
but
any
employer
can't
require
as
a
condition
of
employment
that
you
sign
a
release
that
gives
them
all
manner
of
information
as
to
where
you
shop,
how
you
shop--
mr.
dan
stormer
--well,
other
matters,
general
behavior
or
conduct,
certainly.
mr.
dan
stormer
that's
because
this
question
for
the
types
of
situations
is
not
needed.
the
question
that
is
needed
is,
what
are
the
characteristics
that
you
feel
he
has
for
this
job.
mr.
dan
stormer
primarily
because
of
the
release.
that's
the
sixth
stage
of
standard
form
85.
that
release
just
allows--
mr.
dan
stormer
--because
in
virtually
every
state
there
are
laws
requiring
the
disclosure
of
private
information.
mr.
dan
stormer
i
--
the
reason
i
invoke
that
is
because
the
government
has
stated
that
any
private
attorney
can
ask
these
questions,
and
that's
a
misstatement
of
the
law
in
most
states.
mr.
dan
stormer
if
they've
said
i
violated
state
or
federal
laws,
not
on
its
face
so
long
as
if
it
said
voluntarily,
you
may
show
mitigation
that
--
that
would
show
that
this
is
not
a
problem,
it
would
make
you
unfit
for
the
job.
mr.
dan
stormer
that's
correct.
mr.
dan
stormer
the
difference
is
here
is
because
it
is
compelled.
it's
a
compelled
disclosure
and
not
offering
you
the
opportunity
to
make
a
showing.
and
in
this
concept
the
appeal
right
that
you
have
from
this
is
not
a
robust
appeal
right
that
was
described.
it's
a
very
limited
appeal
that
is
internal
to
the
department,
that
does
not
have
a
right
to
confront
or
cross
examine.
mr.
dan
stormer
there
was
in
the
emergency
order
specific
reference
to
the
release.
there
was
not
in
the
final
order,
but
the
question
can't
--
has
to
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
release,
because
that's
how
they
get
to
--
if
you
go
to
the
betty
ford
clinic.
mr.
dan
stormer
they
did
not.
mr.
dan
stormer
that's
correct.
they
did
not
say
that.
but
it
has
to
be
implicit
in
their
ruling
because
in
many
of
the
case--
mr.
dan
stormer
--the
--
well,
in
the
court
below,
for
instance,
the
argument
that
the
government
made
was
that
they
needed
to
have
the
medical
records,
not
that
they
just
needed
this
information,
that
they
needed
to
have
the
medical
records.
the
question
that
logically
flows
is
what
can
they
do
with
this
information
once
they
learn
that
you
had
counseling?
then
i
guess
they
can
ask
you
who
the
counsellor
was,
what
you
told
the
counsellor.
what
was
the
purpose
of--
mr.
dan
stormer
--it's
handled.
first
you
reveal
the
information
and
then
there
are
22
approvers
at
jpl,
civilians
who
are
not
employed
by
nasa.
they
review
it
and
then
it
goes
to
nasa
and
then
there
is
a
whole
series--
mr.
dan
stormer
--there
is
not.
mr.
dan
stormer
i
may
have
misspoken.
it
doesn't
preclude
an
oral
interview.
i
am
not
aware
of
oral
interviews
having
been
made
or
taken.
mr.
dan
stormer
there
are
22,
the
government
has
approved
22
so-called
approvers
who
are
at
jpl
who
look
over
--
who
are
eligible
to
look
over
these
forms
and
the
responses
to
the
forms.
mr.
dan
stormer
at
this
point
it
only
applies
to
--
well
--
this
is
not
before
the
--
part
of
the
record,
but
when
it
went
back
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
and
all
parties
agreed
that
it
would
only
apply
--
that
hspd-12
would
be
limited
to
these
28
individuals,
that
investigation.
thank
you.
