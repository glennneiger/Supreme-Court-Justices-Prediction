justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
can
the
court
determine
that
the
right
is
not
violated
here
without
having
some
idea
about
either
the
existence
or
the
contours
of
the
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
your
argument
that
the
government
can
collect
whatever
information
it
wants
from
private
individuals
so
long
as
the
information
is
not
publicly
disseminated?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
test
--
what
is
the
test
for
determining
what
sort
of
questions
can
be
asked
in
the
employment
context?
is
there
any
limit?
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
government
says:
well,
we
want
to
know
all
about
your
diet.
we
want
to
know
whether
you
smoke
cigarettes.
we
want
to
know
everything
you
read.
we
want
to
know
what
your
hobbies
are,
what
forms
of
entertainment
you
enjoy,
sexual
practices,
every
aspect
of
your
private
life,
just
because
that
gives
us
a
better
picture
of
who
you
are
as
an
employee.
is
that
okay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
had
thought
before
the
argument
that
one
of
the
purposes
for
asking
about
treatment
was
to
identify
employees
who
may
have
undergone
treatment
on
numerous
occasions
and
dropped
out
of
programs
and
been
unsuccessful,
so
as
to
identify
chronic
drug
abusers.
but
i
guess
in
light
of
what
you've
just
said,
that
this
only
reaches
back
one
year,
that
is
not
a
purpose
of
this.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
see
what
the
alternative,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
to
asking
this
sort
of
open-ended
question.
the
--
the
alternative
would
seem
to
be
to
try
to
compile
a
list
of
every
possible
thing
that
the
--
the
person
might
do
that
would
raise
serious
questions
about
suitability
for
employment
or
would
be
disqualifying
for
employment.
and
that
seems
to
be
impractical.
there's
almost
no
limit
to
the
sorts
of
things
that
might
be
relevant
in
that
respect;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
the
person
who
works
at
the
--
at
the
gift
shop,
or
the
snack
bar
--
i
think
that's
what
you
mentioned
--
has
a
big
sign
on
his
front
lawn
that
says,
"i
hope
the
space
shuttle
blows
up.
"
is
that
information
the
government
has
a
legitimate
reason
to
get?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
now,
what's
the
alternative
to
acquiring
that
information
through
an
open-ended
question?
do
you
have
to
have
a
specific
question
on
the
form?
does
this
individual
have
a
big
sign
on
his
front
lawn
that
says--
[laughter]
"--
i
hope
the
space
shuttle
blows
up?
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
see
what
i
am
getting
at?
i
don't
see
how
you
are
going
to
do
this,
other
than
by
asking
an
open-ended
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
question
on
drug
treatment.
would
it
be
unconstitutional
for
the
government
to
take
the
position
that
to
require
an
employee
or
applicant
for
employment
to
disclose
whether
this
individual
had
violated
federal
or
state
drug
laws,
and
take
the
position
that
if
the
person
gave
an
affirmative
answer
that
was
disqualifying,
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
they
could
say,
have
you
bought,
sold,
used
drugs
in
violation
of
federal
or
state
law?
if
so,
you
are
disqualified.
unless
you
can
show
that
you
have
had
treatment,
and
then
it's
up
to
you
to
disclose
whether
or
not
you
had
treatment.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
really
the
difference
between
that
regime
and
what
you
have
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
much
of
the
information
that's
at
issue
here
can
be
released
and
to
whom?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
candidates
for
federal
civ
--
civil
service
have
long
been
required
to
undergo
a
standard
employment
background
check.
several
years
ago,
the
government
extended
this
requirement
to
federal
contract
employees
who
require
long-term
access
to
government
facilities.
the
respondents
in
this
case
who
were
the
plaintiffs
below
are
government
contract
employees
at
a
nasa
laboratory,
the
jet
propulsion
laboratory.
they
challenged
two
aspects
of
the
government
background
check.
their
first
challenge
concerns
a
question
on
the
standard
form
that
asks
employees
about
any
treatment
or
counseling
that
they
have
received
for
recent
illegal
drug
use.
the
second
concerns
a
series
of
open-ended
questions
on
a
form
that
the
government
sends
to
the
employees
designated
references.
the
respondent's
claim
that
this
inquires
violate
a
constitutional
right
to
informational
privacy.
the
court
has
considered
similar
arguments
in
two
other
cases,
whalen
versus
roe
and
nixon
versus
administrator
of
general
services
both
decided
in
1977.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
plaintiffs
claimed
that
the
government's
collection
of
their
personal
information
violated
the
constitution.
this
court
rejected
those
arguments,
however,
because
the
practices
at
issue
were
reasonable
and
because
the
information
collected
was
subject
to
protection
against
the
public
disclosure.
we
take
the
same
approach
in
this
case
that
the
court
took
in
whalen
and
nixon.
we
assume
without
deciding
that
the
constitution
protects
some
right
to
informational
privacy.
we
hold,
however,
that
the
challenged
portions
of
the
government's
background
investigation
do
not
violate
such
a
right
in
this
case.
these
inquiries
are
reasonable
and
they
further
the
government's
interest
in
managing
its
internal
operations
and
responses
to
the
challenge,
inquiries
are
shielded
from
public
disclosure
by
the
privacy
act.
those
protections
are
sufficient
to
satisfy
any
privacy
interest
that
may
arguably
be
rooted
in
the
constitution.
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeals'
contrary
judgment
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
