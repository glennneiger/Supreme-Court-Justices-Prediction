chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-530,
national
aeronautics
and
space
administration
v.
nelson.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
that
--
does
that
ruling
stop
you
from
asking
that
question
right
now
throughout
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
the
--
yes.
yes,
the
counseling
and
treatment
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
but
if
we
sustained
--
if
we
sustain
the
preliminary
injunction,
the
government
can't
ask
that
question
throughout
the
--
the
--
the
reach
of
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
when
you
say
your
position
would
be
no,
you
mean
that
there
is
no
right
of
any
kind
under
your
--
i
know
you
don't
want
us
to
reach
it,
but
you
would
say
there
is
no
right
of
any
kind
for
a
citizen
to
tell
the
government:
that
is
none
of
your
business.
the
government
will
decide
that
it
can
ask
anything
of
a
citizen,
so
long
as
you
don't
disclose
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
it's
firmly
rooted
in
our
traditions
that
there
is
some
right
to
tell
the
government:
that's
none
of
your
business?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
that's
putting
those
aside.
i
mean,
what
about
some
of
the
hypotheticals
that
justice
alito
posed?
your
diet?
that's
certainly
relevant
in
the
employment
context,
right?
they
are
going
to
have
to
pay
for
your
healthcare,
worry
you
might
miss
things,
miss
days
of
work.
so
i
guess
the
point
is:
do
you
think
the
government's
right
to
inquire
in
the
employment
context
is
exactly
as
broad
as
a
private
employer's
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
reason
--
i've
had
trouble
putting
my
finger
on
it
--
that
you
need
the
information
about
counseling?
you
already
have
the
information,
have
you
used
drugs
in
the
past
year.
i
couldn't
tell
if
you
thought
the
question
about
counseling
was
for
the
good
of
the
employee
--
oh,
you
are
taking
steps
to
--
or
was
it
to
allow
you
to
show,
well,
it
must
be
serious,
because
you
need
counseling.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i've
asked
you
--
whenever
the
government
comes
and
says,
"this
is
for
your
own
good.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
to
be
--
you
have
to
be
a
little
suspicious.
i
mean,
if
it's
--
the
employee
gets
to
expand
upon
his
or
her
answer.
they
say,
tell
us
about
it.
and
they
can
say,
don't
worry,
i'm
in
counseling
or
treatment.
and
even
then
it
doesn't
sound
like
it's
for
their
good.
it's
one
thing
to
say,
i
had
a
drink.
it's
another
thing
to
say,
i'm
in
aa.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
a
question
about
the
way
it's
worded.
you're
--
it
says,
if
you've
used
it
in
the
last
year,
detail
your
involvement
with
drugs
and
any
counseling
you
received.
do
you
understand
the
counseling
question
to
be
limited
to
the
past
year,
or
to
reach
back
as
far
as--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
do
you
think
it's
required?
i
mean,
you
do
sign
at
the
end,
this
is
true
to
the
best
--
do
you
think
it's
required
to
disclose
counseling
and
treatment
you
received
more
than
a
year
back?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
know
--
how
do
you
know
that?
i
mean,
you
ask
a
lot
of
questions
on
these
forms
and
they
say,
well,
we're
not
going
to
hire
you.
how
can
you
go
back
and
say
it
was
because
you
put
in,
you
know,
in
treatment
for
drug
abuse?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
over
the
last
five
years,
this
has
only
come
into
play
128
times
across
the
federal
bureaucracy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
federal
contractors.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
stormer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
gets
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
earlier
question.
you
said
if
there
is
a
rational
basis,
so
is
that
the
test?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no
matter
what
type
of
information?
i
suppose
it's
harder
to
show
a
rational
basis
when
you
get
into
certain
areas
that
--
that
concern
you,
but
is
it
a
rational
basis
test?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in
the
case
of
a
date
of
birth
for
a
driver's
license,
you
say
it's
rational
basis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
just
to
--
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
justice
breyer's
question.
so
now
you
not
only
have
to
decide
which
questions
--
they
can
challenge
any
question
they
want
and
say,
this
isn't
pertinent,
but
you
also
have
to
categorize
which
employees
are
being
asked
that
question.
this
is
a
--
sf
means
"standard
form",
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
--
you
know,
it's
a
big
government,
and
they
can't
tailor
every
inquiry,
every
form,
to
the
individual
applicant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
know
--
you
don't
know
if
it's
a
low-risk
employee
until
you
find
out
what
he
--
he
or
she
is
like
or
what
the
neighbor
thinks.
well,
you
know,
he
keeps
practicing
planting
bombs
or
something.
i
mean,
then
he
becomes
a
high-risk
employee.
you
don't
know
until
you
get
the
information.
that's
the
reason
you
ask
for
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
you
are
saying
--
what
you
are
saying
is
it
may
not
make
much
sense
to
have
the
people
here
fill
out
standard
form
85,
but
the
government
can't
tailor
its
open
--
opening
security
form
to
people
that
--
you
know,
maybe
down
the
road
at
a
different
nasa
laboratory,
they
do
work
on
more
sensitive
information.
it's
a
standard
form.
the
government
has
to
do
things
in
a
standard
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
what
--
under
what
law
could
you
--
a
private
employer
not
ask
for
those
records?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
we
are
talking
about
under
general
federal
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
a
matter
of
statutory
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
understand
the
scope
of
the
preliminary
injunction
to
be?
does
it
bar
the
solicitation
of
this
information
throughout
the
ninth
circuit
or
only
with
respect
to
jpl?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
katyal,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
