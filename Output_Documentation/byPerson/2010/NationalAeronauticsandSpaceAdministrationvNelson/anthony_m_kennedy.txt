and
--
and
if
we
did
so,
it
would
be
because
there
is
an
underlying
privacy
right
that
is
somewhat
ill-defined
or
undefined?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
it
help
us
in
finding
what
this
residual
background
right
is
and
asking
you:
why
is
it
that
you
can't
disclose
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
can't
you
disseminate
the
information?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
no
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
this
is
just
testing
whether
there
is
some
background
constitutional
right
and
how
to
define
it,
if
we
have
to
use
that
as
a
beginning
premise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
would
be
your
position
if
the
--
all
this
information
were
disclosed?
or
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
disclose
all
the
information,
and
they
asked
you
for
your
advice
on
a
constitutional
basis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
a
number
of
statements
in,
i
guess,
the
concurrence
from
the
denial
of
en
banc,
explaining
how
jpl
is
fairly
open,
and
it
is
close
to
the
pasadena
courthouse.
pasadena
residents
and
judges
visit
jpl
often.
are
there
any
statements
of
fact
that
you
don't
agree
with
that
are
not
in
the
record,
other
than
the
matrix
question?
leave
that
aside.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
have
to
agree
with
the
implication
of
justice
ginsburg's
remark,
at
least
what
i
imply
from
it.
look
at
the
private
employment
sphere.
it
seems
to
me
that
for
a
sensitive
position,
a
bank
who
has
people
taking
care
of
--
its
employees
taking
care
of
other
people's
money,
or
the
medical
profession,
that
the
employer
could
be
sued
and
would
be
remiss
if
it
did
not
ask
this
question.
do
you
know
anything
adverse
about
this
person
whom
we
are
going
to
hire
for
a
very
sensitive
position?
this
is
done
all
the
time,
and
we
do
it
with
the
--
a
judge
said
below,
with
our
law
clerk.

anthony

question
42,
do
you
have
--
pardon
me,
question
7
on
form
42,
the
--
the
standard
one,
do
you
have
any
adverse
information
about
this
person's
employment,
residence
or
activities
concerning,
and
so
forth,
violation
of
the
law?
are
you
saying
that
private
employers
cannot
ask
that
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
prospective
private
employer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i'm
asking
whether
or
not
a
private
employer
can
ask
third
persons
the
question
that's
at
form
42
question
7.
i
thought
your
representation
to
me
was
that
private
employers
cannot
ask
that
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
enjoined
by
the
court
below,
was
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
there
are
22
people
in
jpl
that
are
involved
in
the
employment?
