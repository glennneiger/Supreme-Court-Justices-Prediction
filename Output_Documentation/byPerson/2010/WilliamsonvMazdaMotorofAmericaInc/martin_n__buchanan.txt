mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
common
law
claim
that
mazda
should
have
equipped
mrs.
williamson's
seating
position
with
a
lap/shoulder
belt
is
impliedly
preempted
under
the
rationale
of
geier
v.
american
honda.
the
claim
is
not
preempted,
because
it
is
perfectly
consistent
with
and
would
not
frustrate
the
objectives
of
the
operative
1989
version
of
standard
208
governing
type
2
seatbelts
in
rear
seats.
one
point
that
is
clear
from
this
court's
express
preemption
holding
in
geier
is
that
congress
intended
common
law
to
play
a
complementary
role
in
achieving
the
objectives
of
the
motor
vehicle
safety
act.
based
on
the
savings
clause,
the
court
decided
that
congress
intended
to
preserve
a
significant
role
for
state
tort
law
to
operate
in
compensating
accident
victims
and
promoting
greater
safety
in
vehicle
design.
and,
on
the
issue
of
implied
obstacle
preemption,
the
majority
also
agreed
with
the
dissent
that
state
common
law
will
not
be
preempted
unless
there
is
clear
evidence
of
a
conflict
with
federal
objectives.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
justice
scalia--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--justice
scalia,
i
think
the
court
answered
the
question
in
sprietsma
when
it
said
common
law
has
an
important
role
to
play
in
providing
compensation
to
victims.
and
therefore
the
court
found
it
rational
in
sprietsma
to
make
that
distinction;
and
ultimately
it's
a
--
it's
a
judgment
call
for
congress
to
make.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
well--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
believe
common
law
has
an
important
role
to
play,
not
only
in
compensating
victims
but
also
in
providing
manufacturers
with
an
incentive
to
develop
safer
vehicles,
even
safer
than
the
federal
minimum
standards.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
mr.
chief
justice,
for
the
aisle
seating
position
that
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case,
the
reason
nhtsa
decided
not
to
mandate
it
immediately
was,
a,
a
concern
about
obstructing
the
aisleway
with
the
shoulder
belt;
and
b,
a
concern,
yes,
about
the
cost
of
a
possible
alternative
design.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
well,
your
honor,
any
time
nhtsa
creates
a
safety
standard
it
necessarily
takes
into
account
costs
and
benefits
and
the
safety
attributes.
so--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--a
state
tort
action
does.
what
i'm
trying
to
--
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
if
that
were
sufficient
to
preempt,
then
any
minimum
standard
that
nhtsa
creates
would
therefore
preempt
state
law
and
it
would
nullify
the
savings
clause.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
well,
nhtsa
made
a
decision
as
of
1989
that
the
technology
--
it
obviously
had
concerns
about
the
technology
and
costs.
but
any
type
of
--
of
consideration
of
technology
and
costs
is
as
of
that
moment
in
time,
and
the
agency
specifically
encouraged
manufacturers
to
install
type
2
lap/shoulder
belts
in
these
types
of
seating
positions.
and
our
lawsuit
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
agency's
objective
of
encouraging
lap/shoulder
belts
in
these
seating
positions.
by
1993--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--well,
i
think
what
the
agency
did
with
respect
to
these
seating
positions
in
1989
is
it,
a,
it
recognized
that
there
were
tremendous
safety
benefits
for
type
2
lap/shoulder
belts.
and
yes,
it
found
enough
countervailing
considerations
in
terms
of
cost
and
feasibility
not
to
mandate
that
as
part
of
the
federal
minimum
standard.
and
so
from
the
federal
government's
perspective,
for
these
seating
positions,
the
government
was
neutral
as
between
type
1
and
type
2
belts.
either
one
of
those
belts
would
have
sufficed
to
satisfy
the
federal
agency's
objectives.
and
therefore
a
state
law
claim
that
eliminates
effectively
one
of
those
options
does
not
in
any
way
frustrate
the
agency's
objectives.
the
government
has
explained
in
its
brief
that
its
objectives
would
have
been
fully
satisfied
if
all
car
manufacturers
had
installed
type
2
lap/shoulder
belts
immediately.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
they
were,
justice
scalia,
but
the
court's
decision
in
geier
did
not
turn
on
the
mere
fact
that
the
manufacturers
had
a
choice,
and
mazda
is
not
asserting
that
claim
here
either.
the
determinative
agency
policy
at
issue
in
geier
was
that
the
agency
deliberately
sought
a
variety
of
different
passive
restraint
types.
it
was
concerned
about
a
public
backlash
against
airbags,
and
it
wanted
to
encourage
the
development
of
alternative
passive
restraint
systems.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
that
the
government
gave
manufacturers
a
choice.
it
gave
them
two
different
options
for
complying
with
a
minimum
standard;
but
it
didn't
suggest
that
foreclosing
one
of
those
options
would
in
any
way
frustrate
its
objectives.
it
didn't
suggest
that
it
thought
state
--
that
there
should
be
some--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--it
depends
what
the
reason
for
the
choice
is,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
not
if
it's
a
--
not
if
it's
just
simply
creating
a
minimum
standard.
there
is
no
preemption.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
yes,
that's--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--exactly
correct,
justice
ginsberg.
in
geier
the
agency
was
the
entity
putting
forward
the
theory
of
preemption,
that
this
claim
by
geier
that
all
honda
vehicles
should
have
been
equipped
with
airbags,
frustrated
its
intent
to
accomplish
a
whole
variety
or
mix
of
passive
restraint
devices.
it
was
a
direct
conflict
with
the
agency's
objectives.
here,
the
agency
is
telling
us
the
exact
opposite.
it
was
not
trying
to
further
choice
or
variety.
it
was
not
trying
to
maintain
a
diversity
of
type
1
and
type
2
seatbelts
in
rear
seating
positions.
its
objective
was
to
obtain
the
greater
safety
benefits
of
type
2
seatbelts.
the
agency
found
that
type
2
seatbelts
were
more
effective
in
preventing
fatalities
and
serious
injuries,
that
they
offered
greater
overall
protection
for
children,
and,
most
fundamentally,
that
they
actually
increased
seatbelt
usage
in
rear
seating
positions.
our
common
law
theory
seeks
to
obtain
all
those
exact
same
safety
benefits
for
aisle
seating
positions.
and
we
know
by
1993,
when
this
vehicle
was
manufactured,
at
least
one
major
manufacturer,
gm,
was
in
fact
installing
type
2
lap/shoulder
belts
in
aisle
seating
positions.
our
complaint
alleges
that
it
was
perfectly
feasible
for
mazda
to
do
so
in
1993
when
it
manufactured
this
vehicle,
and
that
it
was
unreasonable
not
to
do
so,
and
that's
the
important--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--i
think
that
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case,
justice
kennedy,
but--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--that's
correct.
theoretically,
that
suit
could
move
forward.
but
the
question
that
the
supremacy
clause
asks
is
not
whether
hypothetically,
there
might
be
future
conflicting
jury
verdicts.
the
question
is:
does
our
claim
here
that
we
are
asserting
under
california
state
law
conflict
with
the
federal
objectives?
it
does
not.
the
agency
has
told
us
it
does
not.
there
is
nothing
in
the
contemporaneous
regulatory
history
of
the
type
2
seatbelt
rule
that--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--cannot?
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
my
position
would
be
the
same.
there
is
no
preemption
there.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
your
honor,
any
time
the
agency
considers
costs,
it
is
at
a
particular
moment
in
time.
it
is
not
necessarily
a
determination
that
for
all
the
future,
this
should
never
be
done
and
no
state
law
should
ever
mandate
that
it
be
done.
and
that's
--
what
we
have
here
is
not
only
a
determination
that
there
were
cost
issues,
but
an
affirmative
encouragement
to
manufacturers
to
do
what
our
state--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--i
think
there
was
never
preemption
under
this
regulation.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
not
only
does
it
say
"minimum
standards",
it
explicitly
says
in
the
savings
clause
that
mere
compliance
with
a
motor
vehicle
safety
standard
shall
not
exempt
the
manufacturer
from
common
law
liability.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
it
did.
but
again,
the
key
dispositive
fact
in
geier
was
the
agency's
desire
to
achieve
a
variety
of
different
passive
restraint
devices,
and
a
claim
that
the
entire
honda
fleet
should
have
had
airbags
would
directly
conflict
with
that.
that
was
the
dispositive
fact
in
this
court's
decision
in
geier,
and
that
is
what
is
lacking
here.
and
what
we
have
here
is
much
more--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--no,
that's
not
correct,
justice
scalia.
it's
not
a
matter
of
whether
it's
the
entire
fleet
or
not.
it's
a
matter
of
whether
the
common
law
claim
conflicts
with
the
federal
objective.
and
in
geier,
it
conflicted,
because
the
objective
was
variety.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
no,
justice
scalia,
and
that's
something
that
the
court
in
geier
contemplated
and
discussed.
the
court
in
geier
acknowledged
that--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--it
came
out
--
i
don't
--
i
think
geier
fully
supports
us,
justice
scalia.
and
certainly
on
the
express
preemption
issue,
the
court
acknowledged
the
possibility
that
there
could
be
conflicting
results,
inconsistent
jury
verdicts,
which
is
always--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--i
agree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg.
but
i
think
geier
also
says
that.
geier
relies
on
the
savings
clause
to
say
that
there's
a
significant
role
for
common
law
actions
to
play.
and
specifically
with
regard
to
the
possibility
of
inconsistent
jury
verdicts,
the
court
in
geier
said
the
possible
--
the
possibility
of
nonuniformity,
the
savings
clause
reflects
a
congressional
determination
that
that's
a
small
price
to
pay
for
a
system
where
juries
create
and
enforce
safety
standards
and
simultaneously
provide
compensation
to
victims.
so
i
think
that's
something
the
court
considered
in
geier.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
please.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
the
child
safety
issue
and
i
know
mr.
jay
has
addressed
this
to
some
extent,
but
let
me
be
perfectly
clear,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
'87
to
'89
regulatory
history
that
mentions
anything
about
child
safety
being
a
consideration
in
the
agency's
decision
not
to
mandate
type
2
shoulder
belts
for
aisle
and
center
seating
positions.
specifically,
justice
ginsberg
asked
mr.
garre
about
whether
there
is
anything
about
the
rear
center
seat
being
the
safest
place
for
children
in
that
regulatory
history.
there
is
no
mention
whatsoever
in
that
regulatory
history
about
that
issue,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
this:
the
reason
the
rear
center
seat
was
considered
safer
for
children
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
type
of
seatbelt
that
was
installed
in
that
seat.
it's
considered
safest
for
children
because
it's
farthest
from
the
potential
point
of
impact
in
a
side
impact
collision.
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
you
are
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
was
not
expressed
in
any
way
in
terms
of
a
child
safety
concern.
i
would
also,
minor
correction,
the
interference
with
rear
vision
was
a
comment
that
a
commenter
made
in
the
regulatory
history
and
the
agency
never
really
expressed
an
opinion
one
way
or
the
other
about
whether
that
was
a
concern.
i
think
what's
really
important
here
is
that
state
tort
law
provides
an
incentive
for
manufacturers
to
exercise
their
options
reasonably.
and
whether
that
option
is
to
exceed
a
minimum
standard
that
doesn't
have
options,
or
to
choose
between
two
different
options
that
a
minimum
standard
provides,
state
tort
law
ensures
that
manufacturers
act
reasonably.
our
contention--
mr.
martin
n.
buchanan
--mr.
chief
justice,
under
any
state's
tort
law,
i
think
cost
and
feasibility
would
be
practical
considerations
for
the
jury
under
the
jury
instructions
given.
those
are
liability
issues,
cost
and
feasibility
in
any
tort
system.
and
so
that's
a
liability
issue
down
the
road.
here
it's
important
to
preserve
state
tort
law
because
congress
said
state
tort
law
shall
be
preserved.
and
again,
whether
it's
a
choice
between
options,
type
1
or
type
2,
or
whether
it's
potential
liability
for
not
going
beyond
the
minimum
braking
standard,
either
way
manufacturers
should
be
held
accountable
according
to
congress
in
its
enactment
of
the
statute
for
the
design
choices
they
make.
there
is
nothing
different
about
a
design
standard
option
1
versus
option
2.
the
final
point
i
want
to
make
before
i
sit
down
is
that
i
think
in
some
respects
this
case
with
regard
to
the
question
about
whether
congress
intended
for
the
agency
to
be
the
exclusive
authority
for
weighing
these
types
of
considerations,
in
some
respects
wyeth
versus
levine
is
instructive
here.
because
i
think
that
was
the
same
argument
that
was
made
in
wyeth
versus
levine,
that
a
jury
should
not
be
allowed
to
second-guess
the
fda's
labeling
issues
and
to
allow
the
jury
to
do
so
would
subvert
the
exclusive
authority
of
a
federal
agency,
and
the
court
rejected
that
argument
in
wyeth,
and
as
the
dissent
pointed
out
in
wyeth,
that
statute
did
not
even
have
a
savings
clause.
and
it
did
not
define
the
labeling
standards
as
minimum
standards.
here
we
have
a
much
more
clear
expression
of
congressional
intent.
they
intended
these
to
be
minimum
standards.
they
have
a
savings
clause
that
says
common
law
liability
shall
be
preserved.
obviously
congress
did
not
intend
nhtsa
to
be
the
exclusive
safety
standard
cook.
they
deliberately
preserved
state
court
juries
as
also
providing
for
additional
vehicle
safety
and
for
an
incentive
to
manufacture
safer
vehicles.
