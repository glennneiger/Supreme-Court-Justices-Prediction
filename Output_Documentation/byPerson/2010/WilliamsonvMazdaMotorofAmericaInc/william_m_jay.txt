mr.
william
m.
jay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
chose
to
comply
with
the
federal
minimum
safety
standard
by
installing
a
type
1
seatbelt,
but
the
savings
clause
makes
clear
that
they
are
not
exempted
from
the
consequences
of
that
choice
under
state
common
law
when
that
choice
results
in
injury.
they
must
show
that,
as
geier
makes
clear,
that
the
state
law
rule
of
decision
would
pose
a
conflict
with
an
articulable
federal
policy.
they
haven't
shown
that
here.
i
would
like
to
go
first
to
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked
my
friend
mr.
buchanan
about
cost-benefit
analysis
and
the
federal
judgment
that
at
the
time
the
imposition
of
a
national
uniform
federal
minimum
standard
of
type
2
seatbelts
wasn't
warranted
at
these
seating
positions.
simply
saying
that,
and
i
--
simply
saying
that
is
not
enough
to
establish
that
the
federal
agency
wished
for
the
adoption
of
type
2
seatbelts
not
to
happen.
every
--
as
mr.
buchanan
said,
every
federal
rulemaker
--certainly
every
nhtsa
safety
standard
adoption
mustinclude--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
of
course
the
baseline
is
that
state
tort
suits
can
always
go
forward.
and
in
this
case,
the
agency
decided
not
to
impose
this
nationwide
mandate
because
of
the
tradeoff
between
costs
and
benefits.
the
benefits
were
significant.
everyone
recognizes
that.
everyone
recognizes
that
type
2
seatbelts
were
better
for
--
better
or
at
least
equivalent
for
all
categories
of
passengers,
and
i
will
come
back
to
that.
but
as
far
as
the
imposition
of
costs
go,
nhtsa
decided
that
it
was
not
worth
it
at
that
time
for
nhtsa
to
require
that.
that
doesn't
mean
that
nhtsa
wanted
to
adopt
the
policy
of
freeing
manufacturers
of
--
of
any
obligation
to
incur
those
costs,
let
alone
that
it
wanted
--
for
example,
if
nhtsa
had
thought
that
it
would
harm
safety
for
manufacturers
to
spend
that
money
on
type
2
seatbelts
instead
of
something
else,
it
could
have
said
that.
in
geier,
for
example,
the
reason
that
the
agency
deliberately
sought
variety--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i'm
sorry,
justice
sotomayor?
mr.
william
m.
jay
no,
justice
sotomayor.
it
was
not
preempted
at
any
time.
what
you're--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--the
contrast
between
this
case
and
geier
is
that
this
case,
like
geier,
involves
options,
but
it
does
not
involve
a
federal
policy
that
the
manufacturer
must
remain
free
to
choose
among
those
options
as
it
sees
fit.
in
geier--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
was
going
to
say
in
geier
the
manufacturer
--
the
agency
concluded
that
it
would
disserve
safety
if
automatic
seatbelts
and
airbags
were
not
both
on
the
market.
there
has
been
no
such
determination
here
either
in
1984
or
at
any
other
time.
mr.
william
m.
jay
two
responses,
justice
alito.
first,
the
question
presented
here
about
type
1
versus
type
2
seatbelts
has
only
been
by
decided
by
a
couple
of
federal
courts
of
appeals,
no
states
courts
at
last
resort.
second,
on
the
more
general
question,
why
doesn't
nhtsa
participate
in
these
cases,
nhtsa
as
a
matter
of
course
does
not
usually
participate
in
private
party
litigation
under
state
common
law,
even
when
that
litigation
might
touch
on
a
state
--
the
interpretation
of
a
federal
safety
standard.
and
when
the
courts
asked
for
nhtsa's
views,
nhtsa
generally
responds,
as
this
court
asks
for
the
government's
views
in
this
case
and
the
government
responded.
and
i
think
if
the
court
were
to
look
back
to
the
first
brief
that
the
government
--
in
astring
of
briefs
that
the
government
has
filed
about
these
issues
underthis
act,
the
brief
in
wood
versus
general
motors
filed
in
1990,
you
could
predict
the
position
that
the
government
would
takein
this
case
from
that
brief.
the
government
said
in
that
case
that
options
don't
preempt,
merely
because
they
are
options.
in
most
cases
there
will
be
no
federal
policy
that
presents
a
conflict.
that
case
presented
the
case
of
the
passive
restraint
phase-in
and
there
it
was
the
rare
circumstance,
as
the
court
later
held
in
geier,
where
there
was
frustration
of
the
federal
policy,
but
that's
because
the
federal
policy
was
to
encourage
variety,
not
just
for
its
own
sake,
but
because
variety
would
serve
safety.
the
roads
would
be
measurably
less
safe
if
airbags
were
rushed
into
service.
by
contrast,
in
this
case
nhtsa
would
have
been
perfectly
happy
if
every
manufacturer
had
installed
type
2
seatbelts
the
day
after
the
1989
rulemaking.
so
there
was
no
conflict.
as
far
as
the
child
safety
concern
to
which
justice
sotomayor
alluded,
it
is
referred
to
in
the
1984
denial
of
a
request
to
impose
the
rule
that
later
was
imposed
in
1989.
the
agency
said
that
it
had
concerns
about
how
particular
child
seats,
which
at
the
time
were
anchored
with
a
form
of
tether.
and
it
said
that
it
thought
the
continued
use
of
tethered
car
seats
was
something
that
it
chose
to
encourage
rather
than
anchoring
them
with
type
2
seats.
the
agency
did
not
speak
at
all
to
whether
type
2
versus
type
1
was
better
for
child
safety
and
the
agency
then
answered
that
in
the
1989
rulemaking.
so
for
adults
type
2
seatbelts
are
safer
and
they
encourage
seatbelt
use
because
they
are
more
popular.
for
infants,
the
agency
specifically
asked
whether
type
2
seatbelts
could
be
as
efficacious
as
type
1
seatbelts
in
holding
an
infant
car
seat
in
place.
it
concluded
that
they
could.
that's
set
out
at
page
25
of
our
brief.
and
for
toddlers,
children
who
are
too
small
to
sit
in
a
type
2
seatbelt
without
assistance,
the
agency
recommended
booster
seats.
and
if
there
was
no
booster
seat
the
agency
recommended
that
they
not
use
the
shoulder
belt.
not
that
they
detached
the
shoulder
belt.
the
agency
indeed
specifically
rejected
the
idea
that
the
shoulder
belt
should
be
removed
at
page
47990
of
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--if
the
child
were
injured
by
the
type
2
belt
and
the
suitwould
be
on
the
theory
that
a
type
1
belt
should
have
beeninstalled?
mr.
william
m.
jay
at
the
time,
no,
that
lawsuit
would
not
have
been
preempted.
mr.
buchanan
said
that
that
would
be
harder
case
and
i
think
he
said
that
because
the
agency
was
specifically
encouraging
type
2
seatbelts,
and
in
this
case
respondents
can't
show
anything
suggesting
that
the
agency
was
encouraging
type
1
seatbelts.
so
it
might
be
a
harder
case
for
that
reason,
but
at
that
time
there
were
two
ways
of
complying
with
the
federal
minimum
standard
and
the
savings
clause
provides
that
simply
complying
with
the
federal
standard
does
not
preempt
the
operation
of
state
common
law.
so
we
discussed
the
child
safety,
the
alleged
child
safety
rationale.
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
idea
that
aisle
seats
were
unsafe
for
the
installation
of
these
seatbelts.
as
mr.
buchanan
mentioned,
the
agency
specifically
encouraged
the
installation
of
those
seats
where
it
was
feasible.
it
was
found
to
be
feasible
in
1991
by
general
motors,
which
installed
them.
but
another
word
about
that,
because
respondents
have
suggested
that
the
chief
counsel
of
nhtsa
has
said
in
1994
in
a
letter
something
favorable
to
their
position,
and
that
letter
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
i
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
entire
letter
and
not
the
sentence
that
was
excerpted
several
times
in
respondents'
brief.
because
what
the
agency
said
was
that,
in
response
to
someone
who
complained
that
manufacturers
were
installing
type
2
seatbelts
and
they
said,
the
complainant
said
that
makes
these
minivans
unsafe
because
people
will
be
trapped
in
the
back
seat.
the
agency
said
it
disagreed,
that
people
could
go
under
the
safety
belt,
that
they
could
detach
the
safety
belt,
that
the
safety
benefits
of
a
type
2
seatbelt
outweighed
any
convenience
concern
about
access
to
or
egress
from
the
rear
seat.
and
i
think
that
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
policy
nhtsa
has
taken
all
along.
type
2
seatbelts
are
safer,
more
effective
and
to
be
encouraged.
when
nhtsa
decided
not
to
mandate
that
based
on
its
understanding
at
the
time
of
who
used
seatbelts,
who
used
seatbelts
in
the
rear
center
seats
and
what
the
--
how
many
fatalities
and
injuries
would
be
prevented
and
whether
the
dollar
cost
would
be
justified
by
--
by
the
dollar
equivalent
of
injuries
and
fatalities
prevented,
it
wasn't
making
a
preemptive
judgment
that
type
2
seatbelts,
therefore,
should
not
be
installed.
and
for
that
reason
there
is
no
frustration
of
anything
that
nhtsa
had
in
mind
in
the
1989
rulemaking
by
allowing
this
tort
suit
to
proceed
as
saved
by
the
savings
clause.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
don't
think
that
geier
is
good
for
that
day
only.
i
do
think,
as
we
said
in
geier
and
the
brief
in
wood
to
which
we
alluded
and
so
on,
that
geier
is
the
exceptional
circumstance.
that
was,
of
course,
an
exceptionally
difficult
and
unusual
rulemaking.
the
phase-in
concern
in
geier
one
can
easily
envision
being
replicated
in
another
safety
standard
issue
where
the
agency
were
to
conclude
that
it's
going
to
impose
a
new
requirement,
but
it
does
not
want
it
rushed
into
service
in
the
entire
fleet
right
away
and
so
it
affirmatively
discourages
hurried
installation.
but
that's
not
the
case
here
because
the
agency
actually
encouraged
earlier
compliance.
