mr.
jay
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
true
that
for
a
period
of
10
years
the
lower
courts
uniformly
held
that
there
wasn't
any
preemption
here?
and
if
that's
the
case,
why
didn't
the
federal
government
come
forward
at
any
point
during
that
time
and
say
that
this
is
preempted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
child
were
injured
by
a
type
2
belt,
would
a
suit
based
on
that
be
preempted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
adopt
your
view,
would
geier
apply
to
any
other
regulation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
by
1989,
hadn't
the
agency
decided
that
the
child
safety
concerns
were
no
longer
applicable?
