chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-1314,
williamson
v.
mazda.
mr.
buchanan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
the
reason
that
the
solicitor
general
gives
for
not
--
that
nhtsa
did
not
immediately
require
the
type
2
seatbelt
is
because
the
costs
would
have
been
higher.
is
that
your
understanding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
come
allowing
--
or
why
doesn't
allowing
the
relief
you
seek
under
state
law
impose
those
same
costs,
contrary
to
nhtsa's
objective
in
not
making
those
mandatory?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
a
state
tort
action
does
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
--
i
understand
the
argument.
i'm
not
sure
it's
right,
though,
in
the
sense
that
nhtsa
may
decide
not
to
make
particular
standards
mandatory
for
reasons
other
than
cost.
it
may
decide
it
doesn't
think
the
technology
is
adequately
developed.
it
may
decide
that
it
doesn't
think
there
are
adequate,
you
know,
mechanics
prepared
or
involved.
but
here
it's
because
of
the
cost,
and
the
relief
you
are
seeking
it
seems
to
me
directly
imposes
the
costs
that
nhtsa
decided
not
to
require.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
every
--
there
is
no
objective
that
the
government
pursues
regardless
of
cost.
i
understand
that
their
objective
was
to
encourage
this,
but
it
was
clearly
not
to
impose
it,
because
it
thought
at
that
time
that
the
costs
were
too
great.
so
to
simply
say
their
objective
was
to
get
these
in
ignores
the
other
side
of
the
cost/benefit
analysis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
rule
here
had
another
provision
that
said
you
must
have
type
1?
you
can
have
type
2--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
can
have
type
2,
right?
but
we
are
not
requiring
type
2,
because
we
think
the
costs
on
manufacturers
would
be
too
great.
we
may
require
it
in
the
future,
but
not
now.
is
it
the
same?
is
your
position
the
same?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
the
increased
costs
that
are
imposed
by
the
tort
liability
conflict
with
nhtsa's
determination
in
my
hypothetical
that
they're
not
requiring
type
2
because
of
the
cost?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
said
all
those
thing
in
geier,
too,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
jay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no
--
i
agree
with
you,
it
doesn't
require.
it
doesn't
support
the
inference
that
they
did
not
want
type
2
seatbelts
to
happen,
to
be
used.
it
does,
in
my
hypothetical
view,
support
the
inference
that
it
didn't
want
to
mandate
type
2
seatbelts
because
it
was
worried,
as
you
said
in
your
brief
at
page
9,
about
the
cost.
and
yet
its
worries
about
the
cost,
it
seems
to
me,
are
overridden
by
the
position
that
state
tort
suits
can
go
on
for
the
absence
of
type
2
seatbelts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
tell
--
in
response
to
justice
sotomayor,
how
do
you
tell
whether
the
agency
is
giving
options
or
simply
setting
a
minimum?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
a
minimum,
of
course,
always
gives
you
options.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
buchanan,
have
you
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
talk
about
safety
to
children,
are
you
also
addressing
the
strap
going
across
the
aisle
or
the
strap
interfering
with
vision?
i
know
that
is
not
directly
related
to
children,
but
it
affects
what
type
of
belt
might
be
the
safest
overall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
state
tort
law
doesn't,
juries
typically
don't
take
into
account
the
fleet
costs
of
avoiding
liability,
which
as
i
understand
from
the
sg's
brief
in
this
case
was
the
reason
that
type
2
was
not
mandated,
because
of
the
overall
costs.
you
have
a
jury
with
an
injured
plaintiff,
they
are
not
likely
to
weigh
heavily
the
fact
that
this
would
cost
3
extra
cents
per
car
fleet
wide.
i
think
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
nhtsa
considers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
