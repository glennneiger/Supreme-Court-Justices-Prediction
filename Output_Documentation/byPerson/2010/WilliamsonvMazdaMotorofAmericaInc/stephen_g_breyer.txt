justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nothing
in
the
agency
that
i
can
find
says
that
the
agency
really
wanted
a
mix
of
options.
i
mean,
they
said
it's
up
to
the
manufacturer.
but
in
geier
which
i
think
all
of
this
could
be
just
avoided.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
agency
would
simply
say,
do
they
want
to
have
this
to
be
a
maximum
or
just
the
minimum.
it's
so
easy
to
say
that,
but
i
haven't
found
agencies
saying
it.
i
don't
know
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
are
forced
to
deal
with
the
situation
we
have;
and
the
situation
we
have
in
geier
is
filled
with
indications
that
they
really
wanted
a
mix
because
of
the
unusual
circumstances
present
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
to
point
to
something
here
that
shows
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
also
said
--
it
did
say
as
a
practical
thing,
not
--
not
some
theoretical
legal
thing.
who
is
most
likely
to
know
what
40,000
pages
of
agency
record
actually
mean
and
say?
people
in
the
agency.
and
the
second
most
likely
is
the
sg's
office,
because
they
will
have
to
go
tell
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
the
government
continuously
says,
this
is
what
the
agency
means
and
the
agency
is
telling
them,
yes,
this
is
what
it
means,
the
chances
are
they
will
come
to
a
better,
correct
conclusion
than
i
will
with
my
law
clerks--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
i
have
a
lot
to
do.
all
right.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
practical.
i'm
sorry,
but
that
is
the
practical
idea
that
i
think
underlies
what
was
said
in
geier.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
it
did
--
we
are
dealing
with
1989
primarily.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
1989,
i
think
--
we
are
at
least
quoted
on
the
other
side
--
what
the
agency
said
was,
well,
we
see
these
lap
and
shoulder
belts
are
actually
more
effective.
now,
we
are
reluctant
to
recommend
them
for
the
center
seat
or
aisle
seat
because
people
might
get
caught
in
the
spools.
on
the
other
hand,
manufacturers
may
be
able
to
work
out
that
problem.
therefore,
we
encourage
the
manufacturer
to
try
to
figure
out
a
way
around
it.
and
the
sg,
looking
at
all
that
stuff,
says,
you
see,
they
didn't
mind
if
manufacturers
were
put
under
another
legal
obligation
to
do
it,
because
they'd
have
no
objection
to
making
the
manufacturers
do
it,
they
are
just
not
certain
yet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
that's
--
that's
how
i
read
what
was
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
wrote:
"of
course,
in
those
cases
where
manufacturers
are
able
to
design
and
install
lap/shoulder
belts
at
seating
positions
adjacent
to
aisleways
without
interfering
with
the
aisleway's
purpose
of
allowing
access
to
more
rearward
seating
positions,
nhtsa
encourages
the
manufacturers
to
do
so.
"
it
doesn't
sound
like
they
are
against
a
tort
suit
that
would
require
you
to
do
so,
because,
in
principle
at
least,
all
of
those
things
should
be
taken
into
account.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
those
arguments
are
what
i
think
justice
sotomayor
was
saying:
it
is
a
huge
problem
for
manufacturers.
it's
called
tort
suits
in
different
places
and
different
juries
and
different
states.
but
that
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
case.
if
the
agency
wants
to
displace
those
tort
suits
often,
all
they
have
to
do
is
say
that
the
purpose
is
something
like
you
are
saying
and
that
they
are
intended
to
be
displaced.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
have
to.
that's
why
i
am
only
making
this
comment,
rather
than
in
the
form
of
this
question
that
maybe
i
don't
understand
why
they
don't.
it
would
make
our
job
simpler.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
arises
out
of
an
auto
accident.
the
passenger
sitting
in
the
backseat
of
a
minivan
at
the
isle
was
killed.
the
survivor
brought
tort
suit
in
the
california
state
court
and
their
argument
was
that
the
manufacture
should
have
installed
a
lap-and-shoulder
belts
in
that
backseat
and
not
just
lap
belts
which
is
what
was
installed.
the
california
court
said
that
state
tort
liability
based
on
that
theory
was
preempted
by
the
department
of
transportation
regulation,
its
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standard
208
which
we've
considered
before
and
that
particular
standard
said
that
manufacturers
have
to
install
seatbelts
in
the
back
of
the
minivan,
but
the
belts
can
be
either
lap-and-shoulder
belts
or
simple
lap
belts.
now,
the
california
court
said,
"well,
that
rule
preempts
the
tort
suit
because
the
tort
suit
would
takeaway
from
the
manufacturer,
the
choice
that
the
regulation
gave
him."
and
since
it
conflicts
with
the
federal
regulation,
the
federal
law
prevails
and
the
state
tort
suit
is
out.
now,
in
holding
that,
the
california
court
relied
on
a
case
of
this
court
called
geier.
in
geier
we
consider
that
same
regulation
but
a
different
part
and
the
part
we
considered
required
manufacturers
to
install
some
kind
of
a
passive
restraint
system.
but
like
this,
it
gave
them
a
choice
of
system
and
say,
“airbags
or
automatic
seatbelts
or
something
else.”
and
in
that
case,
we
said
that
regulation
preempted
a
lawsuit
against
the
manufacturer.
that
case
involved
the
suit
which
said
you
have
to
install
airbags.
and
the
manufacturer
said,
"no,”
it
says,
"i
can
install
either
airbags
or
seatbelt
or
some
other
things.”
and
we
said
it
was
preempted.
because
we
look
at
the
regulation's
history
and
we
look
at
the
agencies
explanation
of
the
regulation
and
we
look
at
their
current
understanding.
and
on
that
basis,
we
thought,
"well,
they
really
do
want
to
give
the
manufacturers
of
choice,
that's
an
insignificant
object
of
this
regulation.”
the
agency
thinks
that
by
giving
them
a
choice,
they'll
get
better
safety
regulation
and
that's
up
to
them
so
it's
preempted.
now,
we
do
hear
just
what
we
did
in
geier.
we
look
at
the
history,
the
explanation,
the
purposes,
why
did
they
do
it,
and
after
doing
the
same
kind
of
examination,
we
come
to
the
opposite
conclusion.
because
here,
we
think
that
the
history
and
the
agency's
explanation,
and
their
current
understanding
of
the
whole
thing
showed
that
indeed
they
did
allow
the
manufacturers
to
have
a
choice
between
lap
belts
and
lap-and-shoulder
belts,
but
that
was
not
a
significant
objective
of
what
they
were
trying
to
do.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with,
didn't
have
much
to
do
anyway
with
the
safety
concerns
but
rather
that
choice
simply
reflected
an
agency
judgment
about
comparative
cause
and
benefits
and
that
here,
just
wasn't
sufficient
to
show.
they
thought
it
was
so
important
that
the
states
can't
reach
a
different
decision.
as
far
as
we
could
tell,
from
looking
at
the
history
and
the
background
and
everything,
they
wouldn't
have
cared
that
states
reached
a
different
decision.
so,
for
that
reason,
we
conclude
that
state
tort
law
here
does
not
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
achieving
an
important
federal
objective.
the
choice
wasn't
that
important.
the
state
lawsuit
is
not
preempted.
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
is
reversed.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
