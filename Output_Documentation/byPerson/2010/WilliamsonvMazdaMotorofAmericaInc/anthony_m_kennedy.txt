justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
are
saying
that
once
the
government
gives
the
manufacturer
a
choice,
then
the
jury
--
the
--
the
tort
system
can
second-guess
it;
and
that
is
not
consistent
with
a
likely
government
intent
to
allow
the
manufacturers
a
choice
based
on
the
technical
advances
to
that
date.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
government
says
you
have
a
choice
and
the
state
of
iowa
passes
a
law
and
says
you
don't
have
a
choice.
no
frustration
of
the
governmental
purpose
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
there's
just
--
just
the
statutes
as
i
have
given
them
to
you.
that
there
--
is
there
preemption
just
on
the
face
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
your
theory
is,
if
i
understand
your
case
--
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
--
if
gm
had
installed
type
2,
they
could
have
been
sued
on
the
theory
that
type
1
was
better
and
there
would
have
been
no
preemption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
the
theory
of
your
case,
that
suit
could
go
forward.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
if
the
regulation
comes
out
july
1,
you
say
there
is
a
preemption
until
midnight
july
1,
but
as
of
july
2
there
could
be
a
suit?
