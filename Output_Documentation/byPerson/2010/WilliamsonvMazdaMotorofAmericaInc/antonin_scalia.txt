justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
--
why
would
the
federal
government
do
that?
i
mean,
trust
juries
to
supplement
whatever
--
whatever
the
federal
rules
are,
but
not
permit
state
agencies
who
--
who
studied
the
matter
with
experts,
to
supplement
what
the
federal
rules
are?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
that
make
any
sense,
to
just
say,
oh,
you
know,
we
--
we
don't
want
the
state
mucking
around
in
this
area,
but
of
course
juries
can
do
so?
why
does
that
make
any
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
doubt
they
made
it.
i'm
just
curious
as
to
why
it
could
possibly
have
been?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
i
--
unless
lawyers
bring
suits
before
--
before
juries,
maybe.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
different
from
geier?
didn't
the
automobile
manufacturer
in
geier
--
wasn't
--
weren't
the
manufacturers
similarly
left
to
do,
choose
for
themselves
whether
to
have
one
type
of
constraint
or
another?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
judgment
here
doesn't
apply
to
the
entire
mazda
fleet,
supposedly,
right?
just
to
the
car
that
caused
harm
to
the
plaintiff?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
next
case?
let's
assume
a
similar
case.
is
that
jury
bound
to
come
out
the
same
way
as
to
whether
there
should
have
been
a
shoulder
constraint
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
geier
came
out
against
you.
why
are
you
appealing
to
geier?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that,
and
i
looked
for
a
diagram.
it
talked
about
the
center
seat,
aisle
seat--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
know
what
the
terminology
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
aisle
was
not
between
the
two
seats?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
they
prohibit
it,
if
they
were
so
sure
about
that?
they
allowed
it,
didn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
we
allow
the
juries
to
take
account
of
those
changes
over
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
as
you
say,
the
agency's
rule
only
spoke
of
the
situation
at
that
time.
