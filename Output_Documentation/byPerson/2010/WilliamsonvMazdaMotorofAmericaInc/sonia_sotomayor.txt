well,
it
did
say
that
earlier,
didn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
earlier,
it
said
that
there
was
difficulties
with
--
pre-1989,
'82
or
'84,
that
there
were
difficulties
with
type
2
belts
and
children's
safety.
so
was
this
preempted
in
'82-'84
and
not
preempted
by
'89?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
do
you
need
for
the
agency
to
say
before
geier
comes
into
effect?
for
the
lower
courts,
what's
the
minimum
that
lower
courts
missed
here
in
not
--
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
they
did
in
their
application
of
geier?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
how
is
this
case
different
from
a
situation
where
the
agency
looks
at
a
request
for
a
minimum
standard,
says:
require
that
a
certain
light
be
added
to
the
lights
in
a
car.
the
agency
comes
back
and
says,
you
know,
there
are
so
many
designs
of
cars;
in
some
cars,
particularly
sedans,
the
light
is
an
added
safety
feature;
in
vans
it
may
not
be
because
of
the
size
of
vans.
and
so
we
are
not
going
to
require
it.
we
are
going
to
let
manufacturers,
depending
on
what
design
their
car
has,
to
choose
between
the
two,
so
that
we're
not
going
to
set
a
minimum
standard
for
every
one
because
there
are
too
many
different
designs.
despite
that
ruling,
the
manufacturer
says
it
costs
two
pennies
more
to
put
this
light
in
a
sedan.
i
know
the
agency
has
said
it's
safer,
but
i
don't
want
to
do
it.
i
don't
have
a
van,
i
don't
have
any
reason
except
the
two
pennies
that
i
don't
want
to
do
it.
is
that
case
preempted?
because
you
were
just
merely
given
the
option?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
is
this
different
from
the
hypothetical
where
the
agency
said
there
could
be
an
obstruction
with
the
entry,
but
manufacturers
who
can
design
it
without
the
obstruction
should
really
do
it.
how
is
this,
this
case,
different
than
the
one
hypothetical?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
wait
a
minute.
what
that
--
what
you
are
not
answering
is
flexibility
to
ensure
that
a
manufacturer
imposes
or
thinks
about
safety
and
chooses
the
option
that
is
safest.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
the
inducement
for
a
manufacturer
to
put
the
light
into
a
sedan
or
to
put
a
seatbelt
2,
when
it
can,
without
causing
an
added
safety
risk?
if
it's
preempted,
there
is
no
inducement.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
always
the
case
when
the
agency
sets
a
minimum.
by
setting
a
minimum,
it's
basically
saying
we
don't
want
to
mandate
more.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
--
but
you
are
not
disagreeing
that
the
statute
by
its
term
says
that
a
minimum
doesn't
preempt
state
common
law.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i'm
still
not
sure
why
creating
an
option
is
any
different
than
the
minimum.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
default
is
always
that
the
manufacturers
have
an
option.
a
minimum
by
definition
gives
manufacturers
options.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
haven't
explained
why.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
the
minimum
by
its
own
definition
gives
freedom
to
the
manufacturer
to
impose
more
if
it
chooses,
or
not,
why
does
the
option
to
tell
a
manufacturer,
pick
what
you
think
is
safest,
why
does
that
do
more?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i'm
sorry,
you
still
haven't
responded
to
me.
manufacturers
are
always
at
risk
for
common
law
claims
under
this
statute,
because
this
statute
expressly
says
they
are.
every
design
choice
a
manufacturer
makes
under
almost
any
situation
where
the
common
law
is
in
effect
puts
it
at
risk
that
a
jury
will
decide
whether
it
did
enough
or
not,
under
cost/benefit
analysis
and
technology.
so
i
don't
know
why
when
the
agency
creates
a
minimum
by
choice
or
not,
it
should
be
implicitly
preempted
in
--
from
the
application
of
state
law.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
this
wasn't
the
center
seat.
this
was
an
aisle
seat.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
is
whether
it
was
feasible
in
this
car,
not
whether
or
not
it
was
not
feasible
elsewhere.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
goes
to
my
point
of
the
light
in
the
sedan
versus
the
van.
it's
letting
the
manufacturers
decide
what's
the
best
choice.
