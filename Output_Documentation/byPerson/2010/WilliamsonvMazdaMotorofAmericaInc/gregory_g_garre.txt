mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1984
and
again
in
1989
the
agency
specifically
determined
that
the
statutory
safety
and
practicability
objectives
would
be
best
served
by
giving
manufacturers
the
flexibility
to
install
a
lap-only
or
lap/shoulder
seatbelt.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
typical
case
where
a
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standard
establishes
only
a
minimum,
like
the
standard
for
braking
performance
or
roof
structure
is
not
going
to
be
preempted.
geier
says
that
and
we're
not
challenging
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
this
case
is
different
because
the
agency
specifically
recognized
in
1984
and
1989
that
there
were
serious
safety
and
practicability
tradeoffs
between
these
two
different
design
options
and
specifically
gave
manufacturers
the
option
of
installing
one
type
of
seatbelt
or
the
other.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
are
not
here--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--what
the
agency--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--what
the
agency
wanted
here
was
flexibility.
it
wanted
flexibility
because
it
recognized
that
there
were
safety
tradeoffs
and
that
the
safety
and
practicability
objectives
were
best
served
by
leaving--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
agency
recognized
here
that
type
1
seatbelts,
the
lap-only
seatbelts,
themselves
posed
unique
safety
risks.
it
did
so
to
children.
if
you
look
at
the
1984
rulemaking,
the
agency
couldn't
have
been
more
clear
that
we
are
not
going
to
impose
a
type
2
mandate
for
rear
seats,
because
that's
going
to
be
harmful
to
children.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
agency
preserved
that
very
status
quo
in
1989.
petitioners
recognize
that
in
note
1
of
their
brief.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
don't
think
the
court
should
defer
to
the
agency's
position.
we
don't
think
the
court
should
adopt
it.
in
geier
the
court
found
that
the
regulatory
record
was
clear
enough
that
it
didn't
have
to
rely
on
the
agency
position.
so
we
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
think
what
it
said,
and
obviously
justice
breyer
can
correct
me;
he
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
--
was
that
it
thought
the
regulatory
record
was
clear
enough,
but
it
did
ultimately
say
that
it
did
agree
with
the
agency,
although
it
didn't
make
a
difference
to
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but
if--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--of
course,
from--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
from
the
wyeth
case
we
know
that
the
court
isn't
always
going
to
agree
with
the
agency.
here
i
think
what's
different
from
geier
is
that
you
have
no
contemporaneous
interpretation
of
the
agency.
the
agency
is
looking
at
a
cold
record
going
back
20
years,
and
it's
not
taking
into
account
everything
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
i
think
that's
what
the
sg
says
and
we
think
that
--
that
the
sg
is
wrong.
we
think
the
agency
said
in
1989
and
it
said
in
1984
it
could
not
have
been
more
clear
that
they
did
not
want
to
mandate
the
type
2
belt,
the
very
rule
that
the
petitioners
want
to
mandate
through
this
state
law
tort
action.
they
didn't
want
to
do
it
because
they
were
concerned
about
child
safety,
they
were
concerned
about
aisle
safety,
they
were
concerned
about
practicability.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
statute
says
that
and
from
geier
we
know
that
that
doesn't
resolve
the
preemption
question.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
where
the
option
is
designed
to
create
flexibility
that
serves
the
statutory
safety
and
practicability
objectives--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's
not
that.
as
a
practical
matter,
that
kind
of
option,
like
the
minimum
for
federal
braking
standards
is
fundamentally
different
than
the
kind
of
option
is
geier
and
the
kind
of
option
here.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
reason
why
is
because--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--because
the
agency
determined
here
that
the
flexibility
was
necessary
to
advance
federal
safety
and
practicability
objectives,
and
that
that
--
those
objectives
would
be
frustrated
by
a
type
2
mandate.
and
flexibility
--
this
court
has
recognized--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
when
you
have
the
kind
of
unique
standard
here.
granted,
this
is
going
to
be
the
rare
situation.
but
if
you
look
at,
for
example,
take
child
safety.
the
agency
couldn't
have
been
clearer
in
1984.
look
at
49
federal
register
15241,
the
final
rule,
that
it
was
not
going
to
mandate
type
2
seatbelts
because
they
found
that
that
would
harm
child
safety.
the
agency
specifically
carried
forward
that
rule
in
1989
for
the
rear
inboard
seats
at
issue
in
this
case.
note
1
of
petitioner's
reply
brief
said
that
the
law
is
exactly
the
same
in
1989
as
to
these
seats
as
in
1984.
it
--
hadn't
been
preempted
in
1984,
notwithstandingwhat
my
friend
said
here
from
the
government
today;
and
if
it
waspreempted
in
1984
it
has
to
be
preempted
in
1989.
the
tradeoffs
here,
we
have
talked
about
the
lawsuit
involving
a
--
a
child
who
was
--
who
was
restrained
by
a
shoulder
belt
and
harmed
as
a
--
as
a
result
of
that
belt,
which
is
a
concern
that
nhtsa
has
recognized
throughout
its
history.
under
their
position,
the
manufacturer
could
be
sued
for
having
a
type
2
belt
by
the
child
who
was
harmed
or
by
the
person
in
the
back
row
who
had
difficulty
getting
out
of
the
car
in
the
event
of
an
accident,
just
as
they
could
be
sued
under
petitioner's
theory
for
having
a
type
1
belt.
this
--
the
agency
recognized,
this
was
a
unique
situation
where
there
were
serious
safety
and
practicability
tradeoffs;
they
wanted
to
give
the
--
the
manufacturers
the
flexibility
to
make
this
decision,
and
that
flexibility
served,
the
agency
concluded,
the
federal
safety
and
--
and
practicability
objectives.
if
you
look
at
this
court's
decision--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
sotomayor,
there
are
hundreds
of
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standards,
and
i
would
agree
with
you
for
virtually
all
of
them,
except
you
have
the
rare
standards
--
and
they
are
rare,
like
the
one
in
geier
and
like
the
one
here
--
where
the
agency
quite
obviously
is
doing
something
much
different.
it's
expressly
granting
options
and
it's
making
clear
in
the
record
that
the
reason
it
is
doing
that
is
to
serve
federal
objectives
that
would
be
frustrated
by
the
imposition
of
a
particular
rule.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
this
from
the
standpoint
of
the
manufacturers
who
are
told
that
they
can
manufacture
this
car
with
this
design
or
that
design,
and
you
can
go
look
at
the
federal
register
and
see
that
the
reason
the
agency
is
doing
that
is
to
advance
safety
and
practicability
objectives.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
first
you
would
look--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
a
very
generalized
sense.
but
we
know
from
geier
that
that
doesn't
resolve
the
preemption
question,
because
the
same
could
have
been
said
with
respect
to
the
rule
in
geier.
first
you
look
at
the
rule,
and
you
are
just
not
going
to
find
very
many
rules
at
all
in
the
federal
--
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations
that
provide
this
kind
of
express
option
for
equipment
design.
and
then
second,
you
go
look
and
you
--
and
you
see
what
the
agency
said
about
that
in
its
final
rules
and
the
commentary
accompanying
the
final
rules.
and
here,
if
you
look,
not
only
would
you
find
that
the
agency
granted
this
flexibility
to
serve
federal
safety
and
practicability
objectives,
you
would
find
that
it
specifically
rejected
the
very
rule
that
petitioners
want
to
impose
on
state
tort
law,
because
it
concluded
that
that
rule
would
be
counterproductive
from
the
standpoint
of
safety
and
practicability.
so
there
couldn't
be--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there
was
some
question
about
a
movement
from
tethered
to
non-tethered,
but
that
only
created
the
compatibility
issue
that
the
agency
recognized
in
the
1989
rulemaking
and
1984.
i
mean,
at
the
same
time
the
agency
is
telling
manufacturers:
install
your
--
manufacture
your
car
seats
so
they
can
be
installed
with
a
type
1
lap-only
belt,
and
it's
telling
parents:
parents,
put
your
children
in
the
rear
center
seat
because
that's
going
to
be
the
safest
seat,
which,
by
the
way,
is
the
seat
that
is
going
to
have
a
lap-only
belt.
and
so
it's
clear--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
was
true
at
the
time
of
1989,
as
well
as--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
was
--
as
the
plaintiffs
called
it
in
their
complaint,
it
was
the
middle
seat
in
the
middle
row.
it
was
a
center
seat
in
every
practical
sense.
it
just
happened
to
be
an
aisle
seat
as
well,
because
there
was
a
space
on
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--unfortunately,
the
diagrams--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's
not
in
the
record,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
you
have
three
rows
in
the
car.
in
the
front
row,
you've
got
the
driver's
side
and
the
front
row
driver
on
the
right-hand
side.
and
then
you
have
the
middle
row
of
seat,
and
then
have
you
a
back
row.
the
middle
row
seat
had
a
seat
on
the
side,
which
was
the
outboard
seat,
a
seat
in
the
middle,
which
is
where
the
descendent
in
this
case
was
sitting,
and
then
it
had
an
aisle
next
to
it.
so
it
was
a
center
seat--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
it
was
on
the
side
of
the
vehicle.
so
it
was
the
center
seat
in
every
practical
sense,
and
therefore
created
the
same
structural
concerns
that
nhtsa
recognized.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
if
i
could
make
three
points
in
response
to
that.
first,
as
the
language
you
just
read
indicates,
it
didn't
require
--
they
didn't
encourage
at
all
costs.
they
encouraged
where
this
specific
safety
concern
could
be
addressed.
second,
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
saying,
we
encourage
manufacturers
to
do
what's
appropriate
when
they
can
practically
do
so,
and
a
world
in
which
a
jury
could
have
decided
the
day
after--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
know
from
geier
that
the
agency
doesn't
have
to
make
a
formal
statement
to
justify
its
intent.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
the
record
--
we
certainly
think
the
record
here
--
the
agency
really
couldn't
have
been
clearer
in
saying:
we
don't
want
the
type
2
mandate,
the
lap/shoulder
mandate
the
petitioners
are
trying
to
impose
here.
it
said
it
unambiguously--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
that's
just
not
true.
and
with
respect
to
the
government,
i
don't
think
that
the
regulatory
record
supports
that
generalized
statement
that
it
was
type
2
at
all
--
at
all
costs.
it
was
clear
that
the
agency
recognized--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
gave
the
very
unique
kind
of
option
here.
the
agency
identified
several
costs
with
imposing
a
type
2
mandate
here.
it
recognized
the
unique
safety
concerns
present
when
you
are
trying
to
stretch
a
type
2
belt
across
the
aisle,
which
is
going
to
block
access,
which
is
a
clear
safety
concern.
it
identified
the
child
safety
concerns
which
were
the
basis
for
this
very
same
option
in
1984
and
which
were
carried
forward
when
the
agency
preserved
the
status
quo
for
the
rear
inboard
seats
at
issue
here.
it
recognized
other
safety
concerns,
including
obstructing
the
rearward
vision
of
drivers
when
you
install
the
type
2
belt
in
the
center
seat,
because--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
and
the
portion
of
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
that's
cited
refers
to
the
no
positive
or
negative
effects.
and
that
language,
it
does
not
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
government
and
petitioner
suggests,
for
a
few
reasons.
first,
the
agency
was
referring
only
to
rear
outboard
seats,
not
rear
inboard
seats,
the
kind
of
seat
at
issue.
and
that's
important
because
nhtsa
was
telling
parents:
put
your
children
in
the
rear
center
seat,
the
inboard
seat,
because
that
--
that
seat
also
was
the
seat
that
was
most
likely
to
have
the
lap
belt,
which
is
how
nhtsa
was
telling
child
seat
manufacturers
to
install
their
child
seats,
that
you
could
install
them
with
a
lap
belt
because
it
was
more
compatible
with
that.
second
of
all,
that,
the
reference
to
the
no
positive
or
negative,
was
a
tentative
assessment.
if
you
look
in
the
federal
register
where
that
language
appears
--
it's
on
53
federal
register
47988
to
47989
--
the
agency
said:
this
is
a
tentative
assessment;
we
want
your
comments
on
this.
comments
came
back
and
the
agency
backed
off
from
that
and
said,
we
have
to
examine
this
more.
and
secondly,
that
positive
--
no
positive
or
negative
statement
--
could
only
apply
when
child
--
when
children
were
using
the
boosters
which
would
help
with
the
type
2
shoulder
belt
so
the
belt
wasn't
going
over
the
neck.
but
nhtsa
knew
at
that
time
that
very
few,
less
than
1
percent,
of
parents
were
actually
putting
their
kids
in
the
booster
seats.
this
was
20
years
ago.
this
was
at
a
time
when
many
children
weren't
in
any
car
seats
at
all,
no
matter
what
nhtsa
was
saying.
so
they
recognized
that
they
were
at
real
risk
here,
that
children
--
children
with
a
type
2
belt,
just
to
be
clear
--
and
nhtsa
recognized
this
during
the
1989
rulemaking
--
that
belt
is
going
to
pose
an
obvious
safety
risk
to
children,
because
the
shoulder
belt
that
is
terrific
for
adults
is
going
to
take
--
is
going
to
create
unique
chest
loads
on
children.
and
if
the
children
is
not
on
a
booster,
as
virtually
all
were
not,
the
belt
is
going
to
appear
too
high
on
the
head
--
on
the
neck
or
head,
which
is
a
safety
problem.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
because
this
--
this
was
something,
justice
scalia,
that
the
agency
struggled
with
for
almost
a
decade
until
it
ultimately
adopted
the
latch
system,
which
resolved
the
compatibility
issue
of
the
lapbelt
versus
the
lap/shoulder
belt
for
installing
the
child
carseat.
and
anyone
who
has
tried
to
install
a
child
car
seat
with
a
type
2
belt,
the
lap/shoulder
belt,
knows
how
difficult
it
was.
and
the
agency
went
back
and
forth
on
this
and
ultimately
went
in
a
completely
different
direction
in
1999
and
installed
the
lap
system.
and
another
thing
that
happened
is
over
time,
booster
seats
became
more
accepted.
more
parents
were
putting
children
in
booster
seats.
and
we
solved
that
safety
concern
as
well.
but
20
years
ago,
at
the
time
that
this
rule
was
adopted,
the
agency
clearly
appreciated
the
child
safety
risk.
again,
in
1984--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--because
it
would--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--this
was
an
area
that
nhtsa
was
carefully
monitoring.
you
had
rulemakings
in
'84
and
'89
and
it
adopted
a
very
unique
approach
to
resolving
the
safety
issue,
which
was
to
expressly
give
manufacturers
this
option
to
advance
federal
safety
and
practicability
objectives.
we
haven't
talked
as
much
about
the
practicability
objectives,
but
that
is
one
of
the
statutory
objectives
of
the
act.
congress
couldn't
have
been
more
clear
on
that
and
the
agency
in
1989
couldn't
have
been
more
clear
in
the
final
notice,
saying
we
are
not
going
to
require
manufacturers
to
install
type
2
belts
in
the
rear
center
and
aisle
seats
because
that's
just
too
costly.
it's
substantially
expensive
and
the
agency
well
knew
based
on
its
history
that
imposing
this
sort
of
overly
costly
safety
measures
that
the
type
2
belt
would
have
been
for
these
seats
at
that
time
could
have
proved
counterproductive
with
the
agency's
long-term
safety
mission.
the
agency
said
that
in
the
rulemaking
in
this
case
at
52
federal
register
22819
where
it
said
that
requiring
these
kind
of
overly
costly
measures
created
a
lost
opportunity
to
improve
safety
through
other
means.
this
is
something
that
congress
gave
the
agency
the
expert
judgment
to
make
on
these
matters
and
the
practicability
objectives,
which
was
just
as
much
a
statutory
objective
as
a
safety
objective,
would
have
been
directly
frustrated
if,
as
could
have
happened
under
the
petitioners
position
in
this
case,
on
the
very
day
after
the
agency
passed
this
rule
in
1989
and
said
we
are
not
going
to
require
rear
inboard
seats
to
have
type
2
lap/shoulder
belts.
a
jury
in
california
hit
my
client
with
a
multimillion
dollar
punitive
damages
award
because
they
did
not
install
a
type
2
belt
in
that
seat.
that
would
have
been
directly
contrary
to
the
federal
objectives.
it
would
have
undermined
the
safety
objectives
that
the
agency
recognized
and
it
would
have
undermined
the
practicability
objectives
that
the
agency
recognized,
and
then
you
have
this
world
in
which
manufacturers
like
my
client
could
be
hit
with
multimillion
dollar
punitive
damages
award
in
one
state
for
installing
the
type
2
belt
where
a
child
was
injured
or
someone
was
in
the
back
seat
and
couldn't
get
out.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
that
was
later
in
time.
it
wasn't
in
1989.
truthfully,
if
you
look
at
late
as
2004
when
the
agency
adopted
so-called
anton's
law
rule,
which
eventually
did
mandate
type
2
belts
in
these
kinds
of
seats.
even
then
the
agency
recognized
that
there
were
still
technical
feasibility
concerns
with
installing
the
type
2
belts
in
these
seats.
and
just
to
be
clear,
the
problem
is,
is
finding
the
anchor
to
install
the
shoulder
belt
in
rear
center
or
aisle
seats.
you
have
got
to
anchor
it
somewhere.
if
you
put
it
in
the
side
wall
you
are
going
to
have
straps
crossing
across
the
aisle
and
obstructing
access.
if
you
put
it
in
the
roof
you
are
going
to
have
something--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
the
agency
resolved
conclusively
that
it
was
not
practical
in
1989.
was
it
theoretically
possible?
eventually
manufacturers--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
gave
them
that
flexibility,
the
agency
determined
in
the
1994
chief
counsel
letter
and
we
hope
the
court
does
read
it,
makes
it
clear
that
the
agency
concluded
that
in
this
situation,
and
it's
a
rare
situation,
the
manufacturer
was
in
the
best
position
to
decide
what
was
most
appropriate
for
its
vehicles.
and,
again,
there
is
this
flexibility
objective.
if
you
look
at
fidelity
federal
savings
&
loan
v.
a.
la
cuesta,
the
decision
cited
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
you
have
this
court
recognizing
that
a
federal
law
that
gave
flexibility
where
you
have
a
state
mandate
that
interferes
with
that
flexibility,
that
is
an
actual
conflict.
ultimately
under
geier,
this
court
is
looking
for
the
existence
of
an
actual
conflict.
we
think
a
rule
that
says
manufacturers,
you
are
free
to
choose
between
this
type
of
seatbelt
and
that
type
of
seatbelt,
and
the
reason
we
are
giving
you
that
flexibility
is
to
advance
federal
safety
and
practicability
objectives.
we
are
not
going
to
require
you
to
put
a
lap/shoulder
belt
in
there
because
that
would
frustrate
those
federal
objectives,
the
state
law
tort
suit
that
would
mandate
the
very
thing
that
the
agency
chose
not
to,
to
advance
federal
objectives
is
preempted.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
