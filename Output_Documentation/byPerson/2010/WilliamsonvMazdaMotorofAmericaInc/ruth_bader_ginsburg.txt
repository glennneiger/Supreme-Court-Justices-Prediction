that's
what
the
statute
calls
for,
minimum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
the
agency
is
to
set
minimum
standards.
and
then
i
take
it
that
the
court
in
geier
says
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
a
minimum
standard,
because
if
a
state
deviated
from
it,
it
would
detract;
it
would
be
an
obstacle
to
the
realization
of
the
federal
standard.
but
here
the
--
a
minimum
standard
was
adopted,
minimal
standard,
and
i
think
the
agency
is
telling
us
just
the
opposite
of
what
it
said
in
geier;
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
what
you
are
saying
--
the
statute
says
"minimal
standards"
and
the
agency
says
"no
obstacle",
and
that's
it,
that
if
there
is
a
preemptive
force
to
the
--
to
the
safety
standards,
that
it
is
for
the
government
administrator
to
say
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
are
we
looking
to
geier
when
you
have
a
statute
that
says
common
law
remedies
are
safe?
i
mean,
as
long
as
it
says
that
--
maybe
it
didn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense,
but
they
did
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
garre,
in
--
in
geier
i
think
it
was
justice
breyer
who
called
attention
to
the
agency
having
informed
the
court
that
if
tort
suits
were
to
go
on,
at
--
in
--
in
contradiction
to
the
government's
view
that
there
should
be
both
of
these
--
that
the
safety
standards
that
were
set
there,
it
would
be
disturbed.
it
would
be
impeded.
and
the
opinion
said
we
assign
weight
to
the
department
of
transportation
there,
to
their
view
that
a
tort
suit
there
would
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
federal
safety
standards.
and
if
the
court
gives
weight
to
what
the
agency
says
in
geier,
shouldn't
it
equally
give
weight
here
when
nhtsa
is
telling
us
there
is
no
conflict?
it
says
its
rule
sets
out
what
the
statute
calls
for,
a
minimum
standard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
the
court
--
what
was
the
court
doing
in
saying
that?
was
it
--
just
wanted
the
agency
to
feel
good?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
no
such
statement.
i
mean
there
was
a
statement
we
don't
want
to
impose
those
costs,
but
we
have
the
agency
in
court
--
we
have
the
solicitor
general's
office
in
court
telling
us,
the
statute
says
minimum,
the
statute
says
the
common
law
isn't
displaced,
and
we
are
telling
the
court
that
we
think
this
is
a
situation
where
it
is
minimum
and
so
the
common
law
isn't
displaced.
shouldn't
we
assume
that
the
standard
that
the
agency
set,
that
as
the
agency
said
is
a
minimum
standard
unless
the
agency
tells
us
that
it
should
be
preemptive
of
tort
suits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
in
1989?
i
thought
there
was
some
advance
in
the
child
seats
between
the
early
'80s
and
'89.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
in
1989?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
government
doesn't
mean
what
it
says
the
way
you
do
--
we
are
being
told
here
that
far
from
encouraging
type
1,
all
along,
the
government
says:
yes,
type
2
is
a
better
seatbelt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
they
did
say
that
the
reason
that
we
are
not
making
it
mandatory
is
because
of
some
cost
benefit
analysis.
we
don't
think
we
should
impose
that
as
a
minimum
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
we
were
told
that
there
was
one
manufacturer,
i
think
general
motors
was
mentioned,
that
was
doing
this
type
2
belt
uniformly?
