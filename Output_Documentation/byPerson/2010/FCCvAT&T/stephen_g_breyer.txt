are
there
any
examples
that
you
have?
that
is,
in
the
last
35
years
have
there
been
any
instance
where
the
justice
department
or
some
other
law
enforcement
agency
compiled
a
file
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
that
in
that
file
there
were,
for
whatever
reasons,
a
bunch
of
conversations
about
the
organization's
strategy,
and
it
did
not
interfere
to
release
it
with
--
with
anybody's
personal
privacy,
but
it
might
interfere
with
that
organization's
strategy,
so
the
organization,
whatever
it
was,
the
nrdc
or
something,
was
very
upset
about
it?
did
you
find
a
single
example
or
a
thousand
examples?
or
how
many
examples
did
you
find
of
that
happening?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
one
reason
might
be
that
this
has
really
never
been
a
problem
because
all
the
legitimate
--
or
most
of
them,
anyway
--
that
these
organizations
that
have
interests
in
privacy
are
actually
taken
care
of
by
the
other
17
exemptions
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
may
be
the
first.
that's
why
i
want
to
know,
is
there
--
one
of
the
things
you
would
have
looked
for
is
an
example
of
a
real
problem
of
the
kind
you're
talking
about.
i'm
not
saying
you
don't
have
one.
i
would
just
like
to
know
if
you
found
any,
and
what
they
are,
so
i
could
read
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
possible
reason
you
don't
find
them
is
because
it
is
very
rare
that
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
going
to
try
to
subpoena
the
top
strategy
of
the
--
of
the
nrdc,
confidential
strategy.
there
might
not
be
too
many
such
records.
it
--
another
reason
might
be
that
they
don't
really
care.
another
reason
might
be
--
i
don't
know.
but
if
you
haven't
found
any
examples,
what
we're
back
to
--
or
--
and
maybe
there
are
actual
examples
of
that
--
of
what
you
said
to
justice
ginsburg
of
the
other
instance,
where
the
--
what
was
that
first
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
to
know
about
the
example.
what
was
the
first
one
again?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
worried
about
saying
something
mean
about
a
regulator.
okay.
yeah,
fine.
are
there
examples
of
that?
is
this
the
first
one
and
what's
the
empirical
statement?
