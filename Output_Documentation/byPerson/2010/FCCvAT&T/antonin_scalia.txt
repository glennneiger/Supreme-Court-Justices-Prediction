our
cases
assert,
do
they
not,
that
the
exceptions
to
foia
should
be
narrowly
construed?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we've
said
that
on
a
number
of
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
we're
not
putting
a
thumb
on
the
scale.
we're
taking
account
of
the
fact
that
--
that
congress
has
many
objectives
in
any
legislation
and
that
the
limitations
are
as
important
as
the
substantive
end.
nonetheless,
when,
having
applied
all
of
that,
you
end
up
with,
gee,
i
don't
know;
it
is
ambiguous,
you
say
even
in
that
situation,
we
don't
apply
the
rule
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
what
ambiguity
means.
it
means--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
the
government
wants
to
abandon
the
principle
that
we've
set
forth
in
our
cases--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
exceptions
to
foia
are
to
be
narrowly
construed.
the
government
does
not
support
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
we
did?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
going
to
help
the
government's
position
if
the
government
doesn't
want
to
be
helped.
i'm
happy
to
leave
you
where
you
put
yourself.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
to
go
back
to
the
chief's
question,
you
do
not
deny
that
the
individuals
who
form
the
corporation,
the
officers
and
the
employees,
are
protected
by
the
right
of
personal
privacy
and
indeed
you
will
--
you
will
edit
any
foia
responses
to
protect
those
individuals,
even
though
there
are
many
of
them,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
as
individuals,
not
as
the
corporation.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
why
does
that
related
to
their
privacy?
i
don't
understand
that.
why
does
that
relate
to
the
corporation's
privacy
interest?
anything
that
would
embarrass
the
corporation
is
--
is
a
privacy
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
anything
that
hurts
the
--
the
--
the
image
or
the
goodwill
of
the
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
klineberg,
can
you
give
me
any
example
of
--
your
--
your
brief
talks
a
lot
about
the
adjective
"personal".
but
we're
not
talking
just
about
the
adjective
"personal".
we're
talking
about
the
phrase
"personal
privacy".
"personal",
yes,
can
indeed
apply
to
corporations
sometimes;
but
there
are
certain
phrases
where
it
clearly
does
not.
for
example,
you
talk
about
personal
characteristics.
that
doesn't
mean
the
characteristics
of
general
motors.
you
talk
about
personal
qualities.
it
doesn't
mean
the
qualities
of
general
motors.
you
talk
about
a
point
of
personal
privilege.
it's
not
a
privilege
of
a
corporation.
and
i
think
personal
privacy
is
the
same
thing.
can
you
give
me
any
examples
in
common
usage
where
people
would
refer
to
the
personal
privacy
of
a
--
of
a
corporation?
it's
a
very
strange
phrase
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'll
grant
you
that
--
that
"personal"
could
refer
to
a
corporation,
although
the
government
distinguishes
it
by
etymology
and
so
forth.
never
mind
that.
i'm
talking
about
personal
privacy.
do
you
have
any
examples
from
the
new
york
times,
from,
you
know,
boswell,
from
anywhere,
that
anybody
refers
to
the
interests
of
a
corporation
as
the
"personal
privacy"
of
general
motors?
i
cannot
imagine
somebody
using
the
phrase
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
another
reason
might
be
that
personal
--
nobody
ever
thought
that
personal
privacy
would
cover
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
attorney
general
levy's
description,
which
was
--
which
was
issued
for
the
purpose
of
telling
all
the
agencies
of
the
federal
government
what
this
new
statute
meant
--
and
it
had
a
lot
of
ambiguities
in
it
--
if
that
was
wrong
about
--
about
this
subject,
you
would
have
thought
somebody
would
have
objected.
i
mean,
did
some
members
of
congress
who
--
who
had
passed
foia
say,
this
is
outrageous;
what
about
the
personal
privacy
of
general
motors?
i'm
not
aware
of
any
objections
along
those
lines.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
the
burden
of
the
government
to
show
that
they
intended
to
exclude
corporations,
or
is
it
your
burden
to
show
that
this
exception
was
meant
to
include
corporations?
i
would
think
the
latter
is
where
the
burden
lies
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
if
you're
asking
the
government
to
show
that
the
--
there
was
an
intent
to
exclude
corporations,
i
don't
think
that's
their
burden.
i
think
it's
your
burden
to
show
that
this
exemption
was
intended
to
include
corporations.
