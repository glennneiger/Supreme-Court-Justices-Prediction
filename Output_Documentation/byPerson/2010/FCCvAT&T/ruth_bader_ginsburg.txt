justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
--
what
about
personal
appearances?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
yang,
can
we
go
back
first
to
this.
the
request
came
in
and,
as
i
understand
it,
the
commission
said
there
are
two
exemptions:
the
one
for
trade
secrets,
commercial,
financial
confidential
information;
and
then
there
was
one
with
exemption
7
itself,
but
as
to
the
employee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
the
--
does
the
commission,
unaided
by
at&t,
go
through
the
papers
and
decide
what
would
be
embarrassing
for
an
at&t
employee,
as
distinguished
from
the
corporation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
privacy
act?
the
privacy
act
undoubtedly
concerns
individuals,
human
individuals--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
artificial
beings.
but
it
uses
the
words
"individual
privacy".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
argument
is
based
on
a
case
that
will
come
before
us.
so
--
but
in
this
case
it
is
to
your
interest
to
say,
yes,
that
has
been
--
that
has
been
set
forth
as
precedent,
that
foia
exceptions
are
to
be
narrowly
construed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
include
in
this
the
people,
the
persons
that
you
say
are
shielded
by
this
privacy
exemption,
as
mr.
yang
said,
foreign
governments,
state
and
local
governments,
those
have
all?
those
all
fall
under
the
apa
definition
of
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
give
us
an
idea
of
--
the
corporation
has
been
shielded
by
exemption
4
for
its
confidential,
financial
information,
trade
secrets;
and
its
employees
have
been
protected
under
exemption
7.
what
is
it,
what
would
be
--
would
fall
within
this
privacy
exception
that
would
not
be
confidential
business
information
or
relate
to
employees
of
the
corporation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
were
about
to
give
a
second
example
of
where,
even
though
it
hasn't,
"personal
privacy"
hasn't
been
used
in
the
media.
but
you
said
one
example
is
the
two
officials
who
are
saying
unpleasant
things
about
a
regulator;
and
what
was
your
other
example?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
a
reason
to
change
what
was
the
understanding
of
exemption
7?
one
of
the
items
that
doesn't
work
in
your
favor
was
the
attorney
general's
memorandum
at
the
time
of
the
'74
amendments.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
talking
about
the
--
attorney
general
levi.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
that's
what
i
meant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
klineberg,
you
have
read
the
brief
of
the
project
on
government
oversight
where
they
give
dozens
and
dozens
of
examples
to
show
that,
overwhelmingly,
"personal"
is
used
to
describe
an
individual,
not
an
artificial
being.
and
it
is
the
overwhelming
use
of
personal.
