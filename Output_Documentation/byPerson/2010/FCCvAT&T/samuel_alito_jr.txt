isn't
it
true
that
there
are
contexts
in
the
law
in
which
the
word
"personal"
is
used
to
refer
to
a
corporation?
for
example,
you
could
refer
to
personal
jurisdiction
over
a
corporation,
couldn't
you?

well,
in
ordinary
speech,
the
term
"personal"
is
not
--
the
term
"person"
is
not
used
to
refer
to
a
corporation.
that's
legalese.
but
in
--
but
since
the
--
the
administrative
procedure
act
defines
a
person
to
include
a
corporation,
why
is
it
relevant
here
or
dispositive
here
to
look
to
the
ordinary
usage
of
term
"personal"
as
opposed
to
the
way
it's
--
it's
used
in
the
law?
and
in
the
law,
it
is
sometimes
used
to
refer
to
a
corporation.
justice
samuel

alito,
jr.
suppose
congress
had
used
the
phrase
"privacy
of
a
person",
"privacy
of
any
person".
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
