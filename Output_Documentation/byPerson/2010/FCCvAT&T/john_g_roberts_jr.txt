we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in

mr.

privacy
certainly
isn't
as
limited
as
you
argue
"person",
"personal",
is.
corporations
have
private
property.
they
have
private
documents.
the
concept
certainly
applies
in
the
corporate
context
as
it
does
in
the
individual.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
confidential
property
or
secret
property.
you
have
private
property.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
families
have
rights
of
personal
privacy,
don't
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
in
some
contexts
--
in
some
contexts,
personal
privacy
does
go
beyond
the
individual?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
aggregations
of
individuals?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
yang.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
klineberg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
it's
--
how
does
that
work?
if
you
have
the
president
of
the
environmental
organization
says
something
about
whatever
it
is,
we
can
lobby
this
guy
to
get
this
change,
is
he
able
to
protect
that
on
the
grounds
of
his
personal
privacy,
even
though
the
embarrassment
would
go
to
the
--
the
organization
as
a
whole?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
it
such
a
big
deal,
then,
to
extend
that
to
the
organization
as
a
whole,
if
the
individual's
privacy
is
already
going
to
be
protected?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
mean
you're
--
you're
already
protected,
at
least
to
a
significant
extent,
because
the
individual
officers
would
be
able
to
assert
a
privacy
interest,
to
the
extent
at
least
that
what
you
find
embarrassing
to
--
to
the
corporation
is
also
individually
embarrassing
to
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
your
central
argument
is
that
because
"person"
is
defined
to
include
corporation,
"personal"
in
the
same
statute
must
include
corporate.
i
tried
to
sit
down
and
come
up
with
other
examples
where
the
adjective
was
very
different
from
the
root
noun.
it
turns
out
it
is
not
hard
at
all.
you
have
craft
and
crafty.
totally
different.
crafty
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
craft.
squirrel,
squirrely.
right?
i
mean,
pastor
--
you
have
a
pastor
and
pastoral.
same
root,
totally
different.
so
i
don't
understand
--
i
don't
think
there's
much
to
the
argument
that
because
"person"
means
one
thing,
"personal"
has
to
be
the
same
relation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
yang,
you
have
six
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
09-1279
fcc
versus
at&t.
this
case
started
when
the
federal
communications
commission
conducted
an
investigation
of
at&t.
in
the
course
of
that
investigation,
at&t
turned
over
many
internal
documents
to
the
fcc.
comptel,
a
trade
association
representing
some
of
at&t's
competitors,
filed
a
request
asking
that
the
fcc
give
an
access
to
those
documents.
comptel
filed
its
request
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
or
foia.
and
under
that
act,
federal
government
agencies
are
required
to
make
documents
publicly
available
upon
request
unless
the
documents
are
covered
by
an
exemption.
there
are
nine
such
exemptions.one
of
which
exemption
7
is
the
one
that
issue
in
this
case.
exemption
7
applies
to
information
that
is
complied
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
exemption
7
sees
specifically
exempts
from
disclosure
any
such
information
if
disclosing
it
“could
reasonably
be
expected
to
constitute
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy”.
at&t
sought
to
block
the
disclosure
of
the
documents
it
had
turned
over
to
the
fcc
arguing
that
exemption
7(c)
should
protect
its
personal
privacy.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
corporations
as
opposed
to
just
individuals
can
have
personal
privacy
under
exemption
7(c).
now,
at&t's
primary
argument
is
that
the
word
“personal”
is
the
adjective
form
of
the
word
“person”
and
“person”
is
defined
in
the
foia.
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
congress
defined
the
word
“person”
to
include
corporations
and
various
other
entities
because
the
statutes
says
that
the
word
“person”
extends
to
corporations,
at&t
argues,
so
should
the
word
“personal”
when
used
in
the
same
statute.
we
disagree.
adjectives
often
reflect
the
meaning
of
related
nouns.
a
person
who
is
charitable
is
one
who
is
generous
and
benevolent,
just
as
a
charity
is
an
institution
that
gives
relief
to
needy
persons
and
causes.
but
sometimes
adjectives
and
nouns
have
disparate
meanings.
for
example,
the
adjective
“corny”
does
not
have
any
obvious
connection
to
the
noun
“corn”.
now,
at&t
is
right
that
“person”
in
the
statute
is
defined
to
include
corporations,
but
“personal”
is
not
because
“personal”
is
an
undefined
term
in
the
statute,
we
look
to
its
ordinary
meaning
and
context.
the
ordinary
meaning
of
“personal”
does
not
include
corporations.
we
do
not
usually
speak
of
personal
characteristics,
personal
effects,
personal
correspondents,
personal
influence,
personal
tragedy
as
referring
to
corporations
or
other
artificial
entities.
it's
not
that
corporations
do
not
have
correspondent's
influence
or
tragedies
of
their
own,
but
then
we
do
not
use
the
word
“personal”
to
describe
it.
in
fact,
we
often
use
the
word
“personal”
to
mean
just
the
opposite
of
business-related.
we
speak
for
example
of
personal
expenses
as
opposed
to
business
expenses.
in
addition,
don't
forget
that
we
are
trying
to
figure
out
not
just
the
reach
of
the
term
“personal”
but
of
the
phrase
“personal
privacy”.
an
adjective
can
take
on
a
different
meaning
depending
on
the
noun
that
it
modifies.
a
golden
cup
is
one
made
out
of
or
colored
like
the
metal,
a
golden
boy
is
one
who
is
talented,
successful,
charming
and
so
on.
in
the
present
context,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
“personal
privacy”
does
not
include
corporations.
this
court
has
often
referred
to
the
term
“personal
privacy”
as
it
is
used
in
foia
as
protecting
the
privacy
of
individuals.
but
we
have
no
examples
where
a
court
has
used
that
term
to
describe
the
privacy
of
a
corporation.
at&t
argues
that
the
court
has,
in
fact,
recognized
privacy
interests
of
corporations
in
a
variety
of
context
such
as
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
double
jeopardy
clause.
but
the
issue
before
us
is
a
much
narrower
one.
this
case
is
only
about
foia
exemption
7(c)
nothing
more.
the
case
as
at&t
cites
from
the
other
areas
are
too
far
field
from
the
particular
question
that
issue
here
to
be
of
much
help.
we
hold
that
personal
privacy
in
foia
exemption
7(c)
does
not
include
the
privacy
of
corporations.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
therefore
reversed.
all
members
of
the
court
join
the
opinion
to
that
effect
except
justice
kagan
who
did
not
participate
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
