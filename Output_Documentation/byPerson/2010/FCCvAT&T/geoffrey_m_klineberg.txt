mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
any
organization,
including
not
only
business
corporations
like
at&t,
but
also
nonprofit
organization
and
political
associations,
should
be
categorically
excluded
from
protection
under
exemption
7(c),
such
that
this
exemption
will
now
offer
less
protection
for
privacy
interests
than
the
constitution
and
the
common
law.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
privacy
protections
under
foia
are
broader
and
the
text
supports
that
position.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
justice
ginsburg,
they
do.
and
we
would
agree
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
the
concept
of
personal
privacy
does
apply
to
those,
those
other
categories
of
actors.
now,
whether
once
that
privacy
interest
is
balanced
against
the
public's
interest
in
disclosure
--
that
balance
may
well
be
different
with
respect
to
public
or
foreign
entities.
but
--
but
certainly
they
--
they
have
a
right
to
personal
privacy
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
justice
ginsburg,
we
--
i
could
give
you
two
categories
or
kinds
of
examples.
one
is,
for
example,
a
series
of
e-mails
among
corporate
officers
--
granted,
whose
own
personal
names
and
identifying
information
have
been
redacted
--
but
in
those
e-mails,
they
may
engage
in
a
frank
exchange
about
the
competence
and
intelligence
of
a
would-be
regulator
of
the
corporation.
or
a
--
disparaging
comments
about--
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
--well,
justice
scalia,
the
--
the
answer
is
simply
that
these
were
communications,
conversations,
that
were
occurring
with
an
expectation
of
privacy
by
the
individuals
involved
on
behalf
of
their
employer,
and
to
the
extent
that
they
could
be
used
to
harm
the
reputation
or
the
customer
goodwill
of
--
of
the
company,
they
do
indeed
have
a
--
a
personal
privacy
interest--
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
--your
honor,
everything
that
with
--
that
is
intended
to
be
private
is
certainly
subject
to
the
balancing
that
we're
asking
for
under
exemption
7(c),
indeed
that
congress
provided;
that
if
it
is
--
it's
an
interest
in
personal
privacy,
then
it
is
to
be
balanced
to
determine
whether
the
disclosure
of
that
document
is
unwarranted.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
your
honor,
as
justice
alito
asked
my
--
my
colleague
earlier,
the
--
the
whole
concept
of
--
of
"person"
as
including
a
corporation
would
surprise
many
people,
the
proverbial
person
on
the
street.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
your
honor,
we're
--
we're
not
aware
of
that
phrase
being
used
certainly
in
any
statutory
context--
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
--well,
there's
a
--
there's
a
sub-example
within
that
category
which
is
the
disparaging
of
an
important
customer,
some
unpleasant
comments
about
an
important
customer
of
the
corporation
that
could
then
be
used
quite
--
quite
clearly
by
a
--
by
a
competitor
to
--
to
harm
the
goodwill
of
the
--
of
the
corporation
with
respect
to
that
customer.
but
there
is
indeed
another
whole
category
of
documents
that
goes
beyond
the
--
the
context
of
at&t's
interest
here;
and
the
example
is
internal
documents
within,
say,
an
environmental
nonprofit
organization
talking
about
their
political
strategies
for
defeating
an
amendment
to
the
clean
air
act.
as
an
example,
those
political
strategies
that
were
shared
internally
by
--
by
members
of
the
organization
without
any
intent
to
--
to
have
them
become
public
would
become
subject
to
--
to
automatic
disclosures,
categorical
disclosure,
were
the
government
to
prevail
in
this
case.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
the
answer
is
in
most
cases
yes,
that
in
--
that
the
identity
of
the
--
the
specific
speaker
and
any
identifying
information
corresponding
to
him
or
her
would
be
protected.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
indeed,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
--
that
is
our
position,
that
--
that
the
personal
privacy
of
the
corporation
is
--
is
affected
by
such
disclosure.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
right.
but
the
--
but
the
redactions
that
would
occur
would
in
all
likelihood
simply
be
redactions
of
their
names
and
perhaps
their
titles,
but
their
--
the
substance
of
their
comments
would
certainly
be
--
would
be
disclosed
under
the
government's
view.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
well,
justice
breyer,
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
things
that
has
puzzled
us
in
this
case
is
why
--
why
it
has
taken
35
years--
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
--your
honor,
we
haven't
found
anything
specific
to
the
--
in
response
to
your
question.
but
i
--
i
will
say
that
one
of
the
explanations
for
why
this
issue
has
become
more
important
today
than
maybe
it
has
been
in
the
recent
past,
there
really
are
three
reasons.
one
is
that
exemption
4,
which
mr.
yang
discussed,
has
been
increasingly
narrowed
by
the
courts
of
appeals
to
the
point
where
they
specifically
say,
and
indeed
the
government
concedes,
that
--
that
the
reputational
concerns
and
the
harm
to
customer
goodwill
is
not
the
sort
of
harm
that
exemption
4
guards
against.
and
so
that
has
become
increasingly
clear
among
the
courts
of
appeals,
that
the
interests
in
confidentiality
that
we're
talking
about
under
exception
7(c)--
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
--right.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
well,
the
--
the
first
one
was
comments
about
a
regulator--
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
--your
honor,
it
is
a
--
i
cannot
point
you
to
specific
examples.
they're
--
they're
sort
of
hard
to
--
hard
to
find
in
the
--
in
the
sense
that
they
are
--
that
they're
not
typically
litigated,
and
they
certainly
haven't
been
litigated
under
--
under
this
--
under
this
exemption
before.
but
--
but
i
think
the
other
explanation
for
why
this
matters
today
in
a
way
that
it
might
not
have
mattered
so
much
before,
two
--
two
other
reasons:
one
is
that
--
that
increasingly,
foia
is
being
used
by
--
by
competitors
and
legal
adversaries
to
obtain
information,
not
about
what
the
government
is
doing,
not
about
what
the
government
is
up
to,
but
about
what
evidence
the
government
might
have
gathered
from
private
parties.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
well,
actually,
justice
ginsburg,
at
the
time
of
the
'74
amendments
the
only
existing
attorney
general
memorandum
was
that
of
attorney
general
clark,
which
read
"personal
privacy"--
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
--right,
and
that
--
that
was
issued
subsequent
to
the
amendments
in
1974,
and
that
was
an
--
an
interpretive
gloss
on
the
recent
amendments.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
right.
and
so
at
the
time
that
congress
enacted
the
amendments,
both
under
the
privacy
act
as
well
as
exemption
7(c),
the
--
the
only
existing
statement
about
what
personal
privacy
might
mean
would
be
--
would
have
been
attorney
general
clark's
understanding
that
personal
privacy
can
in
fact
incorporate
interests
of
corporations.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
well,
your
honor,
the
--
attorney
general
levy's
memorandum
did
not
go
into
a
long
discussion
or
description
of
the
analysis.
it
simply
said
it
does
not
appear
or
does
not
seem
to
apply
to
corporations.
and
it's
absolutely
true.
this
is
not
--
this
issue
hasn't
--
hasn't
really
been
litigated
and
presented.
but
our
position
is
that
there's
nothing
in
the
plain
language
that
would
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
categorically
exclude
corporations.
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
legislative
history
at
the
time,
as
the
government
spends
quite
a
bit
of
time
exploring,
does
suggest
that
what
was
--
what
was
in
most
people's
minds
was
protection
of
individual
privacy.
but
there
is
no
indication
that
they
intended--
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
--well,
justice
scalia,
our
--
our
burden
is
to
--
is
to
defend
our
view
of
the
statute.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
we
are
--
our
burden
is
to
demonstrate
to
you
why
the
words
"personal
privacy"
in
the
statute
apply
to
corporations.
i
think
one
of
the
background
facts
is
that
there
is
no
indication
that
anyone
thought
that
it
was
not
to
be
included.
but
let
me--
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
--mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
try
to
explain
precisely
what
our
proposed
rule
of
construction
is,
because
i
think
there's
been
some
confusion
and
i
--
and
i
think
the
government
has
--
has
not
properly
characterized
it,
and
certainly
in
their
reply
brief.
we
do
not
agree,
we
do
not
sign
on
to,
the
term
"grammatical
imperative",
because
our
concern
with
that
phrase
is
that
it
might
suggest
that
the
rule
is
to
be
applied
regardless
of
the
consequences,
and
that
is
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that
where
the
adjective
means
"of
or
relating
to
a
term
that
congress
has
expressly
defined.
"
that
definition
should
be
applied,
so
long
as
it
makes
sense
to
do
so
in
light
of
the
text
and
structure
of
the
statute
as
a
whole.
so
in
this
case,
your
honor,
"personal"
does
--
is
defined
--
when
you
open
up
the
dictionary,
the
very
first
definition
is
"of
or
relating
to
a
particular
person.
"
"person"
is,
then,
defined
by
congress
as
--
to
include
not
only
individuals,
but
--
but
corporations
and
other
associations.
so
in
this
particular
context,
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
look
to--
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
--justice
ginsburg,
we
do
not
dispute
that
personal
is
often,
even
many,
many
times,
used
to
describe
an
individual
and
can
only
be
understood
in
that
context.
indeed,
the
truth
in
lending
act
argument
that
the
government
made
in
its
reply
brief
is
a
perfect
example.
the
word
"personal"
there
is
--
is
mentioned
alongside
personal,
family,
and
household.
and
indeed,
even
in
that
very
same
statutory
definition
of
"consumer",
the
word
is
referred
to
as
"a
natural
person".
so
in
that
context,
it
would
be
absurd
or
inappropriate
to
--
to
borrow
the
concept
of
the
definition
of
"person".
all
we're
saying
is
when
it
is
not
absurd,
when
it
is
not
--
does
not
do
violence
to
the
statute,
under
those
circumstances,
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
borrow
the
definition
that
congress
provided.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
our
reading
does
any
--
any
damage
to
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
exemption
6,
and
the
--
the
simple
reason
is
that
while
the
words
6
do
mean
--
and
we
agree
with
the
attorney
general
clark
in
this
--
do
mean
that
--
the
same
thing
as
it
means
in
exemption
7(c),
but
because
--
precisely
for
the
reason
you
said,
justice
sotomayor
--
the
personnel,
medical,
and
similar
files
limits
the
likely
scope
of
that
privacy
interest
to
individual,
natural
--
natural
persons.
and
that's
simply
not
because
of
the
words
"personal
privacy",
but
because
of
the
company
that
those
words
keep
in
that
--
in
that
particular
exemption.
mr.
geoffrey
m.
klineberg
well,
your
honor,
as
this
court
said
in
the
washington
post
case,
the
understanding
of
similar
files
is
defined
by
the
two
benchmarks
that
are
expressly
provided,
right?
personnel
and
medical.
so
the
kinds
of
files
are
limited
to
the
sorts
of
files
in
which
individual
information
is
likely
to
be
contained.
in
that
case,
it
was
a
passport
file.
again,
our
--
our
argument
is
simply
that
it
is
that
part
of
exemption
6
that
does
the
limited
work
in
terms
of
its
scope.
the
words
6
as
--
as
they
do
in
exemption
7(c).
the
--
the
other
point
that
i
certainly
want
to
make
clear
is
that
our
position
is
that
personal
privacy
is
only
the
first
step
in
the
determination
whether
or
not
a
particular
document
is
disclosed,
because
if
the
government
prevails,
there
will
be
no
need
even
to
articulate
a
public
interest
in
the
disclosure
of
potentially
harmful
documents.
instead,
they
will
be
automatically
available
to
any
competitor
or
legal
adversary.
and
all
we
are
asking
for
and
indeed
all
that
congress
provided
for
is
that
the
privacy
interests
be
weighed
against
the
public
interest
in
disclosure.
and
what
the
fcc
did
here
was
to
categorically
exclude
corporations
from
the
protections
of
exemption
7(c).
and
all
we
are
saying
is
that
those
interests
are
legitimate
and
just
need
to
be
balanced.
and
what
the
government's
obligations
under
these
circumstances
are
is
that
they
need
to
weigh
the
private
interests
in
the
documents
against
the
articulated
public
interest
in
disclosure.
and
that
interest,
of
course,
has
to
do
with
what
the
government
is
up
to,
what
do
these
documents
tell
us
about
what
the
government
is
doing.
and
if,
as
the
amici
on
the
government's
side
suggests,
there
are
lots
of
public
value
and
public
interest
in
the
disclosure,
then
that
balance
is
more
likely
to
be
weighed
in
favor
of
disclosure.
all
we
are
asking
for,
though,
is
that
that
balance
take
place.
and
what's
happened
here
is
that
this,
as
i
said,
a
categorical
exclusion
that
simply
is
inconsistent
with
the
terms
that
congress
laid
out
in
exemption
7(c).
congress
did
not
intend
for
foia
to
be
a
tool
for
an
organization's
adversaries
to
obtain
access
to
harmful
or
embarrassing
documents
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes
where
such
documents
do
nothing
to
open
agency
action
to
public
scrutiny.
if
the
government
has
its
way
in
this
case,
the
result
will
be
what
this
court
decried
in
favish,
which
was
that
it
would
be
the
failure
to
protect
the
privacy
of
citizens
against
the
uncontrolled
release
of
information
compiled
through
the
power
of
the
state.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
urge
that
the
third
circuit
be
affirmed.
