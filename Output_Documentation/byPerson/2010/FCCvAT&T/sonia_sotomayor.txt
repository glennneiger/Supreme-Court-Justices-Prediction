justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
ask
you
a
question.
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
response
to
justice
scalia.
if
there
is
ambiguity,
if
a
term
can
be
given
two
meanings,
and
it's
not
clear
--
and
i
know
you're
challenging
the
clarity
question
here
--
i
thought
that
congress's
intent
to
have
full
disclosure
would
necessarily
mean
that
where
there's
ambiguity
as
to
the
meaning
of
an
exception
then
we
should
change
the
narrowest
meaning.
justice

so
if
an
individual
has
been
--
individual
human
being
has
been
investigated
by
the
fbi
and
a
foia
request
is
made
for
records
related
to
that
investigation,
would
the
name
of
the
individual
not
be
turned
over?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
the
point.
so
really
your
adversary
is
saying
that
the
same
harm
that
occurs
to
an
individual
--
putting
aside
the
difficulty
of
defining
privacy
more
broadly,
but
the
same
harm
that
occurs
to
an
individual
who
is
disclosed
to
have
been
the
target
of
an
investigation
is
an
identical
privacy
right
of
a
corporation;
or
a
corporation
has
the
same
negative
effects
on
the
individual.
so
i
think
they
would
concede
that
privacy
might
need
to
be
defined
differently
for
corporations.
they're
simply
saying
this
privacy
interest
is
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
hard
to
think
they
pled
guilty
already.
so
it
is
hard
to
imagine
how
much
exponentially
more
damaging--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
that
presupposes
some
sort
of
investigation.
so
that's
public
knowledge.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
be
similar
to
medical
files
as
such,
under
exemption
6,
that
uses
the
same
phrase,
"unwanted
invasion
on
personal
privacy"?
so
what
would
your
reading
do
to
exemption
6,
and
how
would
we
create
or
even
make
sense
of
exemption
6?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why?
i
mean,
if
you're
saying
that
personal
privacy
has
some
overlap
with
individual
privacy
--
obviously,
it
has
to
if
you're
going
to
give
meaning
to
personal
privacy
--
don't
we
have
to
give
meaning
to
"and
similar
files"?
and
so
what
would
those
be?
