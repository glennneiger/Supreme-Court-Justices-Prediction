mr.
anthony
a.
yang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
foia's
statutory
protection
for
personal
privacy
in
exemption
7(c)
extends
beyond
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
protects
the
so-called
personal
privacy
of
corporations.
that
holding
is
inconsistent
with
the
text
of
exemption
7(c),
foia's
broader
context,
and
the
statute's
drafting
history,
and
would
lead
to
anomalous
results.
the
word
"personal",
standing
alone,
refers
to
individual
--
an
individual
human
being.
"privacy",
standing
alone,
and
even
more
so
in
the
context
of
the
phrase
"invasion
of
privacy",
invokes
purely
individual
concepts.
and
the
sum
of
those
terms
--
that
is,
the
statutory
phrase
used
in
foia,
"personal
privacy"
--
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts.
it's
long
been
well
settled
that
corporations
have
no
personal
privacy.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
there
are
--
the
term
"personal"
is
sometimes
used
as
a
term
of
art,
and
i
think
personal
jurisdiction
is
one
of
those.
it
is
the
modern,
shorter
term
of
art
for
jurisdiction
in
personam
and
reflects
a
distinction
drawn
still
in
the
law
between
cases
brought
in
personam
and
cases
brought
in
rem.
that
--
the
evolution
of
that
term
in
the
law
as
a
term
of
art
does
not
reflect
what
the
ordinary
meaning
of
"personal"
is.
it
is
just
the
same
as
the
term
"personal
property",
which
also
invokes
long-established
traditional
distinctions
between
property
that
could
be
recovered
in
rem
or
in
real
actions
versus
property
that
might
be
recovered
in
actions
in
personam.
so
--
and,
in
fact,
i
think
it
--
it
is
important
to
note
that
there
are
--
although
maybe
there
are
some
instances
that
--
i
think
there's
one
instance
that
at&t
cites
in
its
brief.
nothing
--
it
never
cited
any
use
of
the
term
"personal"
to
mean
corporate
or
pertaining
to
a
corporation.
and
when
--
when
you--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--a
personal
appearance,
i
think
that
--
that
supports
our
position
as
well.
if
you're
making
a
personal
appearance,
it
is
not
something
that
a
corporation
does.
a
corporation
is
a
--
a
legal
construct.
it
doesn't
exist
as
a
thing
that
can
make
an
appearance.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
i
think
that
--
that
point
actually
reinforces
our
position,
because
although
"person"
is
used
in
certain
legal
contexts
to
refer
to
artificial
persons
and
corporations
and
the
like,
"personal"
is
not.
and
"personal",
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
is
not
simply
a
grammatical
alteration,
an
inflection
of
the
term
"person".
it
has
existed
in
its
own
right
since
the
late
1300s
and
has
developed
meaning
that
is
unique
to
the
term
"personal",
which--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--correct.
there
was
an
additional
exemption,
exemption
5,
which
protected
internal
government
communications.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
how
does
it
do
that?
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
the
touchstone
is
necessarily
embarrassment.
what
the
government
does,
following
this
court's
decision
in
reporters
committee
is
tries
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
personal
privacy
interest
about
individuals,
and
that
is
information
that
pertains
to
particular
individuals.
for
instance,
in
this
court's
decision
in
dod
v.
flra
the
court
explained,
although
an
agency
released
the
name
of
individuals,
it
could
properly
withhold
the
addresses,
the
home
addresses,
of
those
individuals,
even
though
that
might
be
publicly
available
in
phone
books,
because
individuals
have
at
least
some
small
personal
privacy
interest
in
that.
so
what
the
agency
will
do
is
try
to
identify
information
pertaining
to
individuals
and
then
will
conduct
--
if
there
is
certain
information,
will
try
to
conduct
a
balancing
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
public
interest
in
disclosure,
that
is
whether
revealing
this
would
disclose
information
against
the
government.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
i
think
the
corporation
to
the
--
in
a
reverse
foia
case,
for
instance,
which
what
is
we
have
here,
where
the
corporation
is
alleging
that
the
government's
decisionmaking
process
is
arbitrary
and
capricious,
it
has
article
iii
standing
to
resist
the
disclosure
of
documents.
if
you're
using
standing
kind
of
like
a
fourth
amendment
concept
of
standing,
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--it
can
make
an
objection
on
its
own
behalf,
which
is
to
say
that
the
government
has
not
properly
gone
through
the
decision-making
process.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
it's
actually
--
let
me
take
a
step
back.
foia
actions
are
actions
which
seek
to
increase
the
amount
of
documents
that
the
government
has
released
pursuant
to
a
foia
request.
we
have
also
reverse
foia
actions,
which
are
actions
under
the
apa
and
here
under
the
hobbs
act's
review
provisions,
that
would
give
the
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction.
when
there's
a
reverse
foia
action,
the
claim
is
that
the
agency's
final
agency
action
is
somehow
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
not
--
or
contrary
to
law.
so
in
this
case,
the
fcc
has
certain
regulations
which
govern
its
processing
of
foia
requests.
and
at&t's
claim,
as
we
understand
it,
is
that
the
fcc
did
not
comply
with
its
regulations
and,
therefore,
its
decision
was
arbitrary
capricious
because
its
regulations
required
that
it
consider
the
personal
privacy
interest
of
individuals.
i
should
note
that,
with
respect
to
exemption
6
or
exemption
7(c)
the
government
itself
invokes
personal
privacy
of
individuals.
that's
what
we
do
when
we
process
foia
requests,
because
individuals
normally
don't
get
any
notice
that
there
has
been
a
foia
request.
the
government
simply
processes
it
and
asserts
those
rights,
in
the
sense
that
they're
rights,
asserts
those
interests
on
behalf
of
corporations
--
on
behalf
of
individuals.
going
back
to
the
text
of
the
statute,
the
term
"privacy"
and
particularly
an
invasion
of
privacy
invokes
concepts
that
back
to
warren
and
brandeis's
right
of
privacy,
their
article
which
explained
that
or
identified
in
the
law
certain
human
dignitary
interests
that
they
gave
the
label
privacy.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
think
the
term
"privacy",
its
ordinary
meaning,
not
the
only
meaning
but
the
ordinary
and
the
commonly
used
meaning,
does
invoke
individual
concepts.
when
corporations
or
other
entities
are
at
issue,
normally
the
more
appropriate
word
would
be
"confidentiality"
or
"secrecy".
those
concepts--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
true.
but
it's
is
not
privacy.
when
we're
talking
about
the
right
of
privacy,
those
--
that
word
we
think,
again
going
back
to
warren
and
brandeis
and
up
through
the
fifties
and
sixties
when
prosser
was
elaborating
the
law
of
torts
in
his
groundbreaking
article
on
privacy,
those
concepts
applied
only
to
individuals,
and
particularly
when
you
combine
the
terms.
the
restatement
makes
clear,
and
back
to
prosser
it
was
clear,
that
corporations
have
no
right
of
personal
privacy.
so
when
congress
in
1974
was
enacting
exemption
7(c),
there
would
have
been
no
basis
for
it
to
conclude
that
the
rights
that
it
was
conferring
through
the
phrase
at&t
is
correct,
foreign
governments,
state
governments,
local
governments.
there's
no
predicate
for
those
types
of
entities
having
personal
privacy
in
the
law.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
there
are
cases--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--in
certain
contexts,
this
court
has
indicated
that
exceptions
are
to
be
narrowly
construed.
we
think
that,
when
read
in
context,
those
cases
and
other
cases
of
this
court
explain
that
foia's
exemptions
are
to
be
given
meaningful
reach,
because
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
foia
--
and
this
is
somewhat
against
our
interest
in
this
case
and
we
explain
it
more
fully
in
our
brief
in
millner,
which
is
currently
pending
to
the
court
--
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
foia
was
to
establish
a
general
principle
of
disclosure,
but
in
the
exceptions
it
identified
very
important
interests
that
warranted
an
exception
from
those
general
rules.
and
to
narrowly
construe
the
exceptions
we
think
would
distort
rather
than
advance
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
foia.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
our
argument
would
be
a
little
different,
particularly
in
the
context
of
exemptions
6
and
7(c),
where
the
phrase
would
be
"an
invasion
of
privacy
of
any
person.
"
we
think,
particularly
when
we're
talking
about
invasions
of
privacy,
even
though
a
corporation
might
have
a
broader
definitional
meaning
in
context,
congress
in
that
case
would
still,
we
think,
be
referring
to
individuals.
but,
of
course,
that's
not
this
case.
that
would
make
it
a
little
more
difficult.
we
think
we
would
probably
still
prevail
on
that
reading.
but--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--correct.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
it
actually
uses
both
phrases.
it
uses,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
the
phrase
"personal
privacy"
to
explain
that
that's
what
the
act
was
protecting.
and
then
within
the
operative
portions
of
the
act,
it
uses
"individual",
but
it
does
so
for
a
very
specific
reason.
congress
was
intending
to
protect
a
subset
of
individuals
and
it
defined
the
term
u.s.
citizens
and
lawful
permanent
residents.
so
not
all
individuals
would
be
protected
by
the
privacy
act.
now,
congress
did
that,
not
because
had
it
used
the
phrase
u.s.
citizen
or
lawful
permanent
resident.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
i
think
we
disagree,
and
i
think
this
is
why.
no
legislation
pursues
its
primary
goal
at
all
costs,
and
the
foia
exceptions
that
are
at
issue
here
protect
very
important
values
that
congress
deemed
to
warrant
exceptions
from
the
rule.
so
if
the
court
were
to
put
a
thumb
on
one
scale
of
that
balance
that
congress
has
tried
to
strike,
after
using
all
the
normal
tools
of
construction,
we
think
that
would
distort
rather
than
advance
the
intent--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
if
you
were
to
get
--
after
using
all
the
normal
tools
that
the
court
does
and
you're
on--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--that's
usually
a
very
rare
instance,
that
you
are
exactly
at
equipoise.
and
we
certainly
aren't
relying
on
narrow
construction
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
we
think--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--we
do
not
embrace
that
principle.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
we
think
that
those
cases
--
there
are
two
lines
of
this
court's
decisions.
sometimes
the
court
explains
that
exceptions
are
narrowly
construed
and
sometimes
the
court
explained
that
its
decisions
have
given
--
its
decisions
have
given
the
exception
practical
reach
in
order
to
strike
the
appropriate
balance
that
congress
has
tried
to
strike
in
foia.
now,
let
me
just
say,
our
narrow
construction
to
the
extent
the
court
would
want
to
reaffirm
it
here
--
we're
not
advancing
that
--
would
only
help
the
government's
position.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
the
government
has
broader
interests
beyond
a
single
case
and
we
think
that,
again,
we're
not
embracing
strict
construction
in
this
case.
but
again,
that
would
only
help
the
government's
position
if
you
were
to
disagree.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
and
we
accept
that
in
this
case,
and
we
think
that
the
language
of
the
text,
particularly
when
read
in
context
in
light
of
the
statutory
history,
and
particularly
when
you
take
a
look
at
what's
gone
on
since
1974
--
i
mean,
in
the
more
than
35
years
since,
there
has
been
uniform
agreement
that
exemption
6
and
7(c)
apply
only
to
individuals.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
in
certain
contexts
family
members,
as
this
court
decided
in
favish,
can
have
a
right
to
personal
privacy.
but
the
court
in
favish
recognized
that
that
was
a
very,
you
know,
significant
departure
from
the
prior
understanding
that
the
right
of
personal
privacy
in
foia
protects
information
about
the
individual,
him
or
herself,
and
recognized
that
there
is
another
strain
of
personal
privacy
which
from
longstanding
traditions
in
terms
of
--
within
our
society,
the
court
could
draw
on
in
saying
that
personal
privacy
should
also
protect,
at
least
in
the
context
of--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--no,
still
it
is
individual.
i
mean,
those
are
individual
members
of
the
family.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
no.
i
think
an
individual
member
of
the
family
has
a
personal
privacy
interest
by
virtue
of
the
relationship
to
the
decedent
in
favish.
let
me
go
back.
just,
i
think
i
would
be
remiss
if
i
didn't
remark
upon
this
court's
decision--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--correct.
if
there
were--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--as
individuals,
because
the
information
pertains
to
them.
now,
going
to
the
american
express
case,
which
we
explained
in
our
reply,
i
think
that
is
fatal
to
the
proposition
that
--
the
proposition
of
at&t
that
there's
a
grammatical
imperative
that
adjectives
take
the
meaning
of
the
related
noun.
in
american
express,
the
court
construed
the
truth
in
lending
act,
which
includes
the
definition
of
"person"
to
include,
for
instance,
corporations.
it
then
went
on
to
construe
a
term,
"consumer",
which
concerns
transactions
primarily
for
personal,
family,
household,
or
at
the
time
agricultural
purposes.
the
court
explained
that
a
transaction,
the
transaction
that
was
conducted
for
a
corporation's
business
purposes,
that
it
could
not
--
there
was
--
"it
did
not
fall
within
any
of
the
purposes
specified.
"
--that
was
a
quote
--
in
the
definition
of
consumer.
that
is,
it
did
not
concern
personal
purposes.
we
think
that's
fatal.
the
court,
in
fact,
said
it
was
the
only
possible
conclusion
and
that
there
was
no
other
possible
interpretation
of
the
statutory
phrase.
after
repeating
the
enumeration
of
those
four
factors
three
times
and
then
on
the
very
next
page
saying
corporate
--
a
transaction
for
corporate
business
purposes
could
not
be
fit
within
that
definition.
finally,
i'd
like
to
remark
upon
the
anomalies
that
this
court
would
set
us
forth
upon
if
it
were
to
decide
that
corporations
have
personal
privacy.
at
least
in
the
context
of
individuals,
there's
an
established
body
of
law
and
societal
understanding
of
what
a
person,
an
individual,
might
have
a
personal
privacy
interest
in.
but
if
we
expand
personal
to
include
corporations,
foreign
governments,
state
governments,
local
governments,
defining
what
would
be
personal
privacy
of
those
institutions
would
require
an
extraordinary
exercise,
a
simple
policy
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
agency
first
and
then
the
court.
and
this
court
in
favish
was
careful
to
explain
that
that
type
of
decisionmaking
would
be
improper
and
that
appropriate
guides
to
limit
and
make
objective
a
court
and
agency's
decisionmaking
is
required.
congress
provided
no
benchmarks,
never
addressed
corporate,
foreign
governments,
or
any
other
non-human
entity
in
the
context
of
personal
privacy.
and
again,
for
36
years
there's
been
uniform
agreement
that
personal
privacy
applies
in
this
context
only
to
corporations.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
if
someone
is
asking
for
an
investigation
of
tony
yang--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--our
--
i
don't
--
i
can't
say
definitively,
but
i
think
i
can
probably
answer
that,
that
even
answering
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
responsive
record
answers
the
question.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
the
key
point
is
that
we
don't
deny
that
corporations
have
some
interest
in
confidentiality
that
exists
out
there.
for
instance,
at&t
has
relied
upon
the
common
law
of
defamation
where
a
corporation's
business
interests,
business
reputation,
is
implicated.
but
even--
mr.
anthony
a.

--well,
to
be
fair
to
at&t,
there
was
a
settlement
agreement
in
which
they
did
not
admit
any
wrongdoing.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
that
is
public
knowledge.
but
i
think
the
key
point
is
that
the
corporate
--
a
corporation's
interests
in
maintaining
its
business
reputation
has
been
not
regarded
as
a
personal
privacy
interest.
it's
true
that
they
have
interests
and
foia
protects
those
interests,
for
instance,
interests
in
confidential,
commercial
or
financial
information
under
exemption
4.
so
really
we
come
back
to
the
key
point,
which
is
when
congress
used
the
phrase
1974,
or
even
now,
to
think
that
term
would
have
referred
to
corporations.
the
fact
that
corporations
have
other
interests
and
other
rights
that
might
be
legitimate
is
kind
of
beside
the
point
because
those
interests
are
not
referred
to
in
the
law
or
otherwise
as
personal
privacy
interests.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
thank
you.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
at&t
appears
to
have
changed
or
at
least
modified
its
position
somewhat
from
the
position
articulated
at
page
14
of
its
brief.
there
at&t
says,
"by
expressly
defining
the
noun
"person"
to
include
corporations,
congress
necessarily
defined
the
adjective
form
of
that
noun,
personal,
also
to
include
corporations.
"
now,
at&t
has
given
up
on
the
grammatical
imperative
that
guided
exclusively
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case,
there's
nothing
left.
at&t
can
provide
no
example
where
the
term
personal
privacy
has
ever
been
used
to
refer
to
a
corporation,
much
less
a
foreign
government
or
state
or
local
government
in
any
context,
whether
it
be
foia,
the
law
generally,
or
even
in
common
usage.
at&t
can
provide
no
example
of
any
problems
that
have
arisen
in
over
35
years
of
the
government's
consistent
administration
of
this
provision.
in
fact,
all
indications
point
in
simply
one
direction.
personal
privacy
applies
only
to
individuals.
the
terms
personal
and
the
terms
privacy
do
that
alone.
and
together,
personal
privacy
makes
that
clear.
the
legislative
history,
the
decisions
of
this
court
pointing
to
the
balance
applying
only
to
individuals,
individual
rights.
all
point
in
the
same
direction.
we
would
ask
that
the
third
circuit
be
reversed.
