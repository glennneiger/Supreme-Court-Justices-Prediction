mr.
william
e.
marsh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
armed
career
criminal
act
enhances
the
punishment
for
possession
of
a
firearm
or
ammunition
for
a
person
who
has
three
previous
convictions
for
a
violent
felony.
this
case
involves,
as
you
know,
vehicular
fleeing,
which
indiana
has
divided
into
five
categories.
indiana
statute
treats
vehicular
fleeing
as
a
continuum
of
behavior
ranging
from
merely
failing
to
stop
on
the
low
end,
which
is
the
crime
mr.
sykes
was
convicted
of
violating,
all
the
way
to
fleeing
which
results
in
the
death
of
a
police
officer
on
the
high
end,
which
in
indiana
is
a
class
a
felony.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
the
second
tier
up
is
what
we
refer
to
as
(b)(1)(b),
which
is
fleeing
which
either
causes
bodily
injury
or
creates
a
substantial
risk
of
bodily
injury.
the
next
category
up
is
fleeing
which
causes
serious
bodily
injury.
the
fourth
category
is
fleeing
which
causes
a
death.
this
court
recognizes--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--that's
our
position,
your
honor.
when
the
court
considers
the
conduct
encompassed
by
the
elements
of
the
offense--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--then
that
conduct
does
not
involve
conduct
which
creates
a
risk
of
bodily
injury.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
i
would
be
happy
to
respond
now,
justice
kennedy.
the
court
--
the
case
that
you
referred
to
is
the
indiana
case
of
woodward,
from
the
indiana
court
of
appeals,
in
which
the
court
held
that
exactly
that
conduct
did
violate
this
statute
because
the
knowingly
or
intentionally
the
mens
rea
element
goes
only
to
fleeing
and
using
a
vehicle.
so
that
was
one
example--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--of
merely
failing
to
stop.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
that
was
the
holding
of
the
indiana
court
of
appeals,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
well,
the
court
didn't--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--the
court
did
not
elaborate,
your
honor,
on
where
the
line
is,
but--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--that
would
be
more
likely
to
create
a
risk,
but
the--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--justice
scalia,
the
holding
of
the
indiana
court
of
appeals
was
in
response
to
a
position
taken
by
the
defendant,
sort
of
along
the
lines
of
the
two
lines
of
questioning,
which
is
surely
the
statute
requires
something
more
than
merely
failing
to
stop,
but
the
indiana
court
of
appeals
used
precisely
that
language.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
the
prosecutor
is
not
under
any
obligation;
was
that
the
question,
justice
alito?
mr.
william
e.
marsh
yes,
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
correct.
the
prosecutor--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--well,
i
suggest
that
it
does,
your
honor,
because
the
--
the
james
case
makes
clear
that
the
court
will
determine
whether
the
crime
creates
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another
by
looking
at
the
conduct
encompassed
by
the
elements
of
the
offense.
now,
the
fact
that
some
other
offense
maybe
could
have
been
charged
or
was
charged
i
suggest
on
the
categorical
approach
is
not
relevant.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
tate
versus--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--i'm
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
well,
those,
of
course,
aren't
the
facts
here.
and
i
would
have
to
know
what
the
individual
was
convicted
of
because,
of
course,
under
the
categorical--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--but
of
course,
under
the
categorical
approach
established
by
taylor
and
followed
consistently
by
this
court
since
that
time,
the
court
doesn't
look
at
the
facts
of
the
individual
case.
the
court
looks
at
it
categorically.
so
if--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--if
the--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--yes.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
right.
well,
indiana,
of
course,
does
grade
it,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
and
it
is
significant
that
the
second
most
serious
category
is
where
the
conduct
does
present
a
substantial
risk
of
bodily
injury.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
but
of
course,
your
honor--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--thank
you.
yes.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
yes.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
yes.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
justice
breyer,
in
2003,
when
mr.
sykes
was
convicted
of
this
offense,
what
you
said
is
exactly
right.
of
course,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
the
motivation
of
prosecutors
generally,
let
alone
in
this
case.
and
it
really
wouldn't
matter
what
it
was
in
this
case,
what
it
is
generally.
but
i
think
it's
significant
that
in
2006
the
indiana
general
assembly
amended
that
statute
so
now
the
(b)
violation
carries
with
it
a
mandatory
jail
sentence,
60
days.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
yes.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
yes.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
it's--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
habitual
sentencing
enhancements,
one
of
which
specifically
relates
to
driving.
i
can't
say
that
it
is
based
on
substantial--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--yes.
that's
a
good
point,
justice
sotomayor.
the
enhancements
generally
in
indiana
relate
to
previous
convictions,
and
so
i
can't
say
for
sure,
but
it's
entirely
possible
that
(b),
(b)(1)(b),
would
be
a
predicate
crime
for
a
habitual
traffic
offender,
which
is
what
it's
called.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--your
honor,
the
best
definition
of
"aggressive"
that
i've
seen
was
in
the
first
circuit
opinion
in
the
herrick
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
which
the
first
circuit
refers
to
as
forceful
action,
especially
where
intended
to
dominate
or
master.
but
on
general
everyday
language,
it
strikes
me
that
when
a
law
enforcement
officer
wants
somebody
to
stop,
whether
they're
in
a
vehicle
or
not,
the
fight
or
flee
sort
of
comes
into
play.
and
the
person
who
responds
by
going
toward
the
police
officer
and
resisting
in
that
way,
which
is
the
first
part
of
this
indiana
statute,
would
be
acting
in
an
aggressive
way.
the
person
who
flees
is
not
acting
in
an
aggressive
way.
they're
trying
to
avoid
the
confrontation,
trying
to
get
away
from
the
law
enforcement.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
your
honor,
it
may
very
well
be.
it
certainly
would
satisfy
the
risk
element,
similar
in
risk
to
the
begay
case.
i
think
it
would
still
have
to
be
decided
whether
it's
violent
and
aggressive,
but
it
may
very
well
be.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
because
the
indiana
general
assembly
has
decided
in
enacting
this
legislation
that
some
vehicular
fleeing
presents
a
substantial
risk
of
bodily
injury
to
another
and
some
doesn't,
and
they've
drawn
this
distinction.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
state
doesn't
treat
them
as
equally
severe.
the
range
of
punishment
for
a
class
d
felony,
which
both
of
those
crimes
are,
is
all
the
way
from
zero
to
3
years
in
prison,
and
the
actual
conduct
undoubtedly
is
a
factor
in
what
the
person's
ultimate
sentence
will
be.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
yes,
your
honor,
that's
of
course
entirely
possible.
but
again,
just
as
with
the
categorical
approach,
the
court
cannot
take
into
account
the
motives
of
prosecutors.
i
would
suggest
the
motives
of
defendants
and
defense
lawyers
can't
be
taken
into
account,
either.
further,
i
think
it's
more
important
that
when
indiana
enacted
this
statute,
it
was
not
thinking
of
acca
and
predicate
crimes,
i
assume.
i
don't
think
the
legislature
takes
those
kind
of
things
into
account.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
question
that
would
have
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
whether
there's
some
basis
to
--
well,
first
of
all,
determine
whether
it's
violent
and
aggressive.
my
position
would
remain
it's
still
not
violent
and
aggressive.
but
even
on
the
second
part
of
the
begay
approach,
this
court
has
not
seen
anything
that
gives
you
any
basis
for
knowing
what
the
risk
of
injury
is.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
i'm
sorry.
i
understood
the
question
to
be
that
(a)
is
repealed
and
(b)
is
left
in
place?
mr.
william
e.
marsh
right.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
your
honor,
the
equation
would
be
different
because
of
the
significance
of
the
(b)
offense.
so
that's
not
exactly
our
case.
but
i
will
adopt
justice
scalia's
answer,
which
i
think
is
exactly
right.
i
--
it
still
would
not
be
something
that's
violent
or
aggressive.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
justice
alito--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--justice
alito,
i
think
it
breaks
down
to
the
two
parts
of
the
begay
test.
in
order
to
be
a
violent
felony,
it
has
to
be
similar
in
kind
and
similar
in
degree
of
risk.
the
existence
of
(b)
makes
clear
that
the
degree
of
risk
for
violating
(a)
is
not
the
same,
because
if
you
accept
the
continuum
of
behavior
as
created
by
the
indiana
general
assembly,
the
person
who's
convicted
of
(a)
has
not
created
a
substantial
risk
of
bodily
injury.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
right.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
your
honor,
the
inquiry,
as
the
court
said
in
james,
is
whether
the
conduct
encompassed
by
the
elements
of
the
offense
presents
the
risk,
and
that's
the
--
the
determination
that
the
court
has
to
consider.
it
is
not
necessary,
and
i'm
not
contending,
that
this
crime
is
a
violent
felony
only
if
every
conceivable
violation
of
the
statute
constitutes
a
risk
of
danger.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
you
draw
it
--
i'm
sorry?
mr.
william
e.
marsh
you
draw
the
line--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--the
line
is
defined
by
the
statute:
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
now,
how
do
you
make
that
determination?
well,
the
court
made
clear
in
chambers
that
empirical
data
is
one
way
to
do
it.
there
isn't
any
here
because
of
all
the
empirical
data
presented
by
the
government.
it
relates
to
vehicular
fleeing
as
if
there
was
one
crime
of
vehicular
fleeing,
and
most
of
it
is
--
is
calculated
based
on
death
or
injury,
and
that
of
course
is
not
the
category
that
we
have
here.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
your
honor,
it's
not
a
weird
situation
because
the
indiana
definition
of
the
crime
of
vehicular
fleeing
is
not
one
all-encompassing
crime.
it's
--
they
took
the
all-encompassing
generic
vehicular
fleeing
and
divided
it
into
five
subparts,
which
i
suggest
makes
it
much
easier
to
resolve
the
(b)(1)(a)
question.
if
there
is
no
other
categories,
that
would
be
justice
scalia's
point,
i
think,
and
then
it
would
be
a
much
harder
question.
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
it
would
be
considered
a
violent
felony.
for
one
thing--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--no,
i
think
you're
exactly
right,
justice
alito.
that
would
be
possible.
empirical
data
could
show
what
you
have
just
suggested.
of
course,
that
would
be
indicating
that
the
indiana
general
assembly
didn't
have
any
rational
basis
for
dividing
the
two,
but
the
important
thing
here
is--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--but
the
important
thing
here,
your
honor,
is
there
simply
is
no
such
data
before
this
court.
there
is
no
empirical
data
regarding
(b)(1)(a).
mr.
william
e.
marsh
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
common
sense
and
experience
is
not
a
reliable,
predictable
way
of
deciding
these
cases.
you're
right,
there
frequently
is
not
empirical
data.
if
there's
not
either
empirical
data
that
demonstrates
the
danger
involved
or
a
crime
that
--
where
the
danger
is
pretty
obvious
so
that
there
would
be
widespread
general
agreement
--
common
sense
is
what
has
led
to
a
lot
of
the
conflicts
in
the
circuits,
i
would
suggest.
i
reserve
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
suggest
that
it's
helpful
to
start
to
look
at
the
in-kind
part
of
the
begay
test
on
a
more
general
level
than
we've
been
discussing.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
justice
sotomayor,
the
basic
distinction
is
that
the
person
who's
charged
with
escape,
assuming
that
escape
means
escape
from
a
secure
institution
or
from
a
person,
is
that
the
person
is
in
custody,
and
it
takes,
in
the
ordinary
case,
aggression
and
violence
to
get
out
of
the
custody
of
that
person.
the
person
who
is
fleeing
is
trying
to
avoid
being
taken.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
i
think
the
phrase
that
you
just
used
is
the
distinction
that
i
was
referring
to.
the
person
who
is
fleeing
is
trying
to
avoid
being
in
custody.
they're
acting
in
a
--
instead
of
going
toward
the
officer
and
resisting,
they're
going
away
from
the
officer.
the
person
who
is
in
custody
has
to
use
some
kind
of
force,
and
in
johnson,
of
course
the
--
this
court
referred
to
violent
as
the--
mr.
william
e.
marsh
--that's
--
that's
true,
justice
alito,
but
as
the
court
held
in
james,
finding
an
example
of
a
case
that
would
not
be
violent
does
not
solve
the
ordinary
case.
the
ordinary
case,
i
would
suggest,
requires
something
more
than
that.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
of
course
the
ordinary
case
or
the
typical
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
court
needs
to
look
at
the
conduct
encompassed
by
the
elements
of
the
statute,
and
so
we
would
have
to
look
at
exactly
what
the
statute
requires.
the
circuit
courts
have
been
very
divided
on
escape.
in
my
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit,
the
federal
statute,
751,
has
been
held
not
to
be
--
which
is
a
general
escape
statute
--
not
to
be
a
violent
felony.
but,
again,
the
court
talks
about
the
ordinary
case
in
the
james
case
for
the
purpose
of
disabusing
the
idea
that
one
can't
get
out
from
under
the
violent
felony
designation
just
by
coming
up
with
a
hypothetical
case
or
an
example
where
it
can
be
done
without
--
without
violence.
here,
i
would
suggest
that
counsel
has
just
created
for
the
court
some
kind
of
a
hypothetical
case
to
define
the
typical
or
ordinary
case.
this
court
has
never
done
that,
and
this
court
said
in
james
that
it's
important
to
stick
to
the
conduct
encompassed
by
the
elements
of
the
offense,
because
if
we
start
factoring
in
other
kinds
of
conduct,
as
several
of
the
things
which
have
been
mentioned
by
counsel
for
the
government,
that
begins
to
raise
apprendi
problems,
which
is
another
whole
issue.
but
the
court
said
in
james,
and
i
would
acknowledge
is
the
law,
that
so
long
as
the
determination
as
to
whether
there's
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
is
made
by
focusing
on
the
conduct
encompassed
by
the
elements
of
the
offense,
then
there's
not
an
apprendi
problem.
mr.
william
e.
marsh
thank
you.
