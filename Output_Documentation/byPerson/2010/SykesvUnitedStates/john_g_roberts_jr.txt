roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-11311,
sykes
v.
united
states.
justice
ginsburg
is
not
on
the
bench,
but
will
participate
in
the
argument
through
the
transcripts
and
the
tapes.
mr.
marsh.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
looking--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
looking
--
looking
--
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
your
answer.
looking
for
a
safe
place
to
stop
violates
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
marsh.
mr.
wall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
not
--
14
isn't
very
many.
and
i
assume
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases
aren't
litigated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
read
your
brief
and
i
was
--
i
read
your
brief
and
was
surprised
that
when
you're
--
the
list
--
one
of
the
things
you
talk
about
to
show
that
is
media
reports.
you
usually
have
a
more
concrete
basis
for
--
for
speculation
than
media
reports.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
one
of
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--another
word
is
"aggressive"
in
begay,
and
that's
where
i
have
a
little
difficulty
with
your
argument.
it
seems
to
me,
this
is
the
exact
opposite
of
aggressive.
he's
running
away.
certainly
the
other
option
is
to
turn
and
confront,
and
he
doesn't
want
to.
there's
nothing
aggressive
about
running
away.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
the
risk
of
violence,
i
understand
that,
and
purposeful,
which
i
guess
everything
is.
but
those
are
the
three
words,
"purposeful,
violent,
and
aggressive.
"
i'll
give
you
purposeful,
i'll
give
you
violent,
but
aggressive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
you're
two-thirds
of
the
way
home
free.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
a
difference.
the
opposite
of
passive
is
active.
it's
not
aggressive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
active.
he's
running
away,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what's
the
aggression?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
there
was
--
i
don't
know
where
--
i
don't
remember
where
it
was
from.
i
thought
there
was
a
development
of
best
police
practices
that
you
don't
just
chase
people.
you
know,
if
they're
going
30
miles
an
hour
over
the
speed
limit
through
a
school
zone,
that
doesn't
mean
the
police
officer
should
do
that.
you
know,
you
call
ahead,
they
put
these
strips
on
the
road,
whatever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
whether
it's
aggressive
or
not
depend
upon
how
it
happened?
i
mean,
it
could
be
--
i
mean,
the
flight
puts
in
place
the
potential
for
--
for
violence,
i
agree
with
that;
but
if
somebody
just,
you
know,
jumps
out
between
two
cars
while
the
fellow's
fleeing,
how
is
his
conduct
changed
to
aggressive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
like
he
--
it's
not
like
he's
aiming
for
the
guy.
i
mean,
it's
putting
it
in
a
dangerous
situation.
it's
purposeful.
again,
i'll
give
you
violent
in
the
sense
that
it
has
that
potential.
but
he
didn't
want
to
hit
the
--
the
person.
it's
not
aggression
against
the
person.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who's
he
aggressing
against?
when
someone
sees
the
police
and
says
i'm
getting
out
of
here
and
drives
down
the
highway,
say,
at
80
miles
an
hour,
you
know,
25
miles
above
the
speed
limit,
who
is
he
--
i'm
sure
it's
not
the
right
verb,
but
who
is
he
aggressing
against?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it's
not
that
there's
no
specific
target.
there's
no
target.
what
this
guy
hopes
is
that
nobody
gets
in
his
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
wall.
mr.
marsh,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's,
for
me,
anyway,
an
important
question.
i'll
--
i'm
not
sure
the
ordinary
case
does.
i
assume
the
ordinary
prison
escape
is
--
i
don't
know
--
over
the
wall,
under
the
tunnel
or,
you
know,
while
the
guard's
looking
a
different
way,
or
some
--
i
don't
know
that
it's
typical
that
when
the
guard
is
there,
you
say,
now's
my
chance.
the
typical
case
doesn't
involve
aggression.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
