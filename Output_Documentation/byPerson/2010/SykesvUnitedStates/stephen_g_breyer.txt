justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
looking
at
it
categorically
i've
always
thought
means
you
look
to
see,
not
just
what
the
elements
are
on
paper,
but
whether
the
elements
as
used
in
reality
in
the
state
are
applied
to
cases
that
do
present,
in
general
apply
to
cases
that
do
present
a
serious
risk
of
physical
injury.
and
you
think
the
answer
is
we
don't
know
because
no
one's
gone
and
looked.
you
could
do
it
through
sampling,
but
no
one's
gone
and
looked.
i've
just
said
that's
my
view.
the
--
so
what
do
we
do?
i
mean,
i
can
deal
with
a
lot
of
other
states,
but
arizona
has
exactly
the
same
classification
of
felony
when
you
use
a
vehicle
and
when
you
use
a
vehicle
creating
a
serious
risk
of
physical
harm
to
others.
it's
in
the
same
provision,
same
statute,
same
category.
how
do
we
work
with
that
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
following
what
i'm
doing?
you
understand
the
difference
between
arizona
and
46
other
states?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
other
states
they
grade
it.
but
here
they
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
indiana,
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
thinking
of,
and
i
need
a
little
explanation,
we
look
to
see
in
(b),
and
it
says
it's
a
class
d
felony
if
a
vehicle
is
used.
that's
(a)
under
(1).
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
we
look
to
(b)
under
(1),
and
it's
also
a
class
d
felony,
in
other
words
the
same,
if
a
vehicle
is
operated
in
a
manner
that
creates
a
substantial
risk
of
bodily
injury.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
a
prosecutor
looking
at
that
will
say,
why
don't
i
just
charge
a;
what's
the
point
of
charging
b?
i
mean,
it
makes
no
difference
apparently.
it's
simpler
to
prove
a.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can
deal
with
it
more
easily
then.
what's
worrying
me
now
is
what
we're
supposed
to
do
is,
is
the
offense
an
offense
that
presents
a
serious
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we're
here
trying
to
decide
whether
the
(a)
one
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
answer
is
i
don't
know,
and
the
reason
i
don't
know
is
i
don't
know
how
that
offense
language
of
(a)
is
applied
in
indiana.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
problem
is
there
is
arguably
not
here
a
gradation.
suppose
it
only
had
(a).
if
it
only
had
(a),
for
me
--
i'm
not
saying
for
you
--
this
wouldn't
be
a
tough
case.
that
is
to
say,
i
can't
imagine
a
person
running
away
from
a
police
in
a
car
where
there
isn't
a
real
risk
to
other
people.
he's
speeding,
you
know.
i
would
think
--
i
don't
see
how
you
get
away
from
the
policeman
unless
you
speed,
and
there
are
going
to
be
pedestrians.
who
knows?
but
i
think
that
was
pretty
--
at
least
as
bad
--
at
least
as
much
of
a
risk
as
burglary.
so
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
it
would
be
simple.
at
least
assume
that.
now,
then,
however,
suppose
we
have
a
state
which
says,
but
it's
a
worse
thing
to
run
away
and
create
a
risk,
in
a
separate
provision.
it's
a
worse
thing.
all
right?
then
i
would
say,
huh,
now
i'm
not
so
sure.
why
didn't
they
charge
the
worse
thing?
this
must
be
reserved
for
cases
where
it
isn't.
so
here
we
have
a
rather
weird
situation.
they're
saying
it's
a
different
thing,
but
not
a
worse
thing.
so
now
i
say:
well,
why
didn't
they
charge
--
now
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
why
they
didn't
charge
the
separate
special
one.
i
don't
know
what
the
facts
are.
i'm
puzzled.
now,
that's
your
case.
that's
where
i
needed
the
enlightenment.
so
what's
the
enlightenment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right?
when
you
replied
to
justice
scalia,
i
thought
that
he
had
said
that
we
were
dealing
with
a
statute,
and
you
seemed
to
agree,
that
said
it
is
a
crime
to
flee
a
policeman
after
being
ordered
to
stop.
but
i
thought
we
were
dealing
with
a
statute
that
says
it
is
a
crime
to
flee
a
policeman
after
being
ordered
to
stop,
in
a
vehicle.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
you're
--
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
have
one
of
38
states
which
treat
this
--
treat
the
general
offense
as
a
misdemeanor,
and
then
make
it
a
felony
if
you
put
somebody
at
risk.
just
reading
that
statute
you
would
think
those
36
states
when
they
have
the
general
offense
do
something
where
the
guy
acted
pretty
trivially;
and
where
it's
a
felony,
he
actually
puts
somebody
at
risk,
sped
off,
wouldn't
that
be
your
normal
instinct
in
just
guessing
from
the
--
from
the
language?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
are
we
supposed
to
treat
those,
where
there's
a
misdemeanor--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
your
opinion,
it's
just
a
misdemeanor,
we
also
treat
it
the
same
way;
say
it's
a
violent
felony?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
that's
actually
my
question.
are
we
supposed
to,
in
this
federal
statute,
try
to
track
whether
it's
a
misdemeanor,
what
the
language
is?
we're
going
to
have
a
nightmare
of
a
federal
law
for
states
to
--
for
judges
to
figure
this
out.
i
mean,
every
little
variation
in
thousands
and
thousands
of
possible
variations
could
make
a
difference
as
to
whether
it's
violent
or
not,
depending
on
data
which
no
one
will
have.
