mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
just
a
very
quick
moment
of
history,
i
think,
provides
some
useful
background,
and
i'm
on
page
3a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
until
1998,
subsection
(b),
which
we've
been
talking
about,
was
the
only
class
d
felony
that
involved
vehicular
flight
in
indiana
law.
in
1998
the
indiana
general
assembly
broke
out
and
enacted
subsection
(a)
so
that
in
cases
of
vehicular
flight
prosecutors
would
not
have
to
prove
risk;
they
would
just
have
to
prove
that
defendant
used
a
vehicle.
since
1998,
i
have
found
14
cases
in
the
indiana
court
of
appeals,
one
of
which
is
the
hape
case
that
justice
alito
cited
earlier.
all
of
them,
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
proceeded
under
(a)
and
not
under
(b).
of
those
14
cases,
13
have
enough
facts
to
tell
what
the
flight
was
--
of
what
kind.
10
involved
speeding,
disregarding
traffic
laws,
or
striking
an
officer
with
a
vehicle.
of
the
other
three,
only
one
involved
non-risky
behavior,
and
even
that
was
not
a
defendant
who
drove
a
short
distance
and
then
pulled
over.
it
was
a--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--yes,
justice
scalia,
these
were
all
litigated
to
conviction
and
taken
up
on
appeal,
and
the
indiana
court
of
appeals
addressed
various
legal
issues--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
think
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
government's
point
is
that
here
we
have
extensive
data,
both
empirical
and
otherwise,
that
indicates
that
flight
as
a
basic
offense
is
very
dangerous.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
if
that
is
all
we
had
put
forward,
i
might
agree
with
you,
but
we
also
put
forward
extensive
statistical
data.
my
point
is
just
that
indiana
is
typical.
it's
dangerous
everywhere
else.
it's
four
times
as
dangerous
as
arson.
it's
more
dangerous
than
household
burglary.
there's
nothing
different
about
indiana.
if
one
looks
through
these
cases,
these
flights
in
indiana
are
typically
quite
dangerous.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
i
thought--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--that's
right,
this
court
looks
at
the
conduct
encompassed
by
the
elements
in
a
typical
case.
and
in
a
typical
case
of
vehicular
flight
what
we
have,
according
to
the
data,
is
someone
fleeing
police
at
an
average
of
25
miles
an
hour
over
the
speed
limit,
someone
who
is
in
a
typical
case
young,
male,
unlicensed,
under
the
influence
of
alcohol,
and
who
places
the
lives
of
other
motorists,
pedestrians
and
police
in
harm's
way.
your
approach
to
acca,
justice
scalia,
has
been
to
look
at
the
conduct
encompassed
by
the
elements
and
ask
whether
the
risk
from
that
conduct
is
at
least
as
great
as
the
--
the
least
risky
enumerated
offense.
and
here--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
sotomayor,
it's
absolutely
true,
there
are
two
parts
to
the
test,
and
we've
been
talking
about
the
first
risk.
on
the
second
prong
the
purposeful,
violent
or
aggressive
character
of
the
conduct,
here
i
think
there
are
three
distinct
things
that
make
it
purposeful,
violent,
and
aggressive.
first,
you
have
the
defiance
of
the
officer's
order,
which
can
cause
injury
at
the
scene.
it
has
in
some
indiana
cases,
but
at
least
caused
the
officer
to
give
chase.
second,
you
have
the
very
real
prospect--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
yes,
but
you
are
driving--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--you're
driving
away
in
response
to
an
officer's
command
to
stop.
you're
calling
the
officer
to
give
chase.
you
--
you're
--
pursuit
is
likely.
and
even
when
there
isn't
pursuit,
these
offenders
drive
typically
very
recklessly,
and
then
you've
got
the
confrontation
when
the
officers
have
to--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--terminate
the
flight.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
let
me
analogize--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--no,
let
me
concentrate
on
burglary,
then,
and
analogize
it
to
what
this
court
said
in
james.
it
said
the
risk
of
attempted
burglary--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--that's
right,
but
i
--
the
court
has
talked
about,
even
in
chambers,
about
the
risk
of
a
violent
confrontation
with
law
enforcement
officials,
and
it's
done
that
under
the
begay
part
of
the
test.
and
whereas
that
confrontation
is
only
possible
with
burglary,
it's
necessary
with
this
crime.
it
requires
that
an
officer
order
you
to
stop
and
that
you
flee.
so
that
--
that
confrontation,
which
is
only
a
possibility
with
burglary
or
attempted
burglary,
is
elevated
to
a
certainty
with
this
offense.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think
it
--
it
would
suggest
that,
justice
kagan,
but
i
think
flight
on
foot
is
unlikely
to
satisfy
the
risk
part
of
the
test.
i
think
certainly
this
case
is
much
easier
on
the
--
the
james
part
of
this
test.
i
think
the
--
the
flight
in
a
vehicle
poses
risks,
very
real
risks,
to
other
motorists
and
pedestrians
and
police
that
flight
on
foot
doesn't
pose,
although
you
would
still
have
the
confrontation
when
the
flight
on
foot
was
terminated,
so
i
think
some
of
the
arguments
would
translate,
you're
right.
i
think
there
would
be
more
difficult
questions,
though,
on
the
risk
prong.
this
is
a
much
easier
case.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
words
do
have
meaning.
but
the
words
here
are
very
broad:
"serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
others.
"
and
as
you
yourself
have
recognized
in
--
in
multiple
opinions,
what
those
words
call
for
is
a
comparison
of
risk
between
an
offense
and
acca's
enumerated
crimes.
this
offense,
simply
put,
is
more
risky.
it's
four
times
as
risky
as
arson
in
terms
of
injuries
and
fatalities.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
it's
more
risky
than
household
burglary.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
there
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
you're
doing
it
in
a
vehicle,
and
typically
at
high
speeds.
so,
in
chambers--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
give
me
those
two
i
think
we're
home
free,
because
this
court
said--
[laughter]
--in
chambers--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i'll
take
it
and
let's
work
on
the
last
third.
so
the
--
what
this
court
said
in
chambers
is
not
all
attempts
to
evade
authorities
are
of
the
same
stripe.
so,
it
contrasted
escape
from
prison
with
failure
to
report.
failure
to
report,
you
could
do
at
home
on
your
couch;
you
could
just
fail
to
show
up.
and
the
court
said:
look,
that's
passive;
it's
a
crime
of
inaction.
this
is
not
that.
it's
not
sitting
at
home
on
a
couch.
this
is
quintessentially
a
crime
of
action.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--but
it's
very
--
it's
hard
to
see
what
the
difference
would
be
between
this
and
escape
from
custody.
and
this
court
clearly
indicated
in
--
in
chambers
that
escape
from
custody
was
different
from
failure
to
report
under
the
statute
in
front
of
it.
and
i
think
this
is
as
dangerous,
maybe
even
more
dangerous
than
escape
from
custody.
if
the
court
were
going
to
say
that
all
running
away
could
not
be
aggressive
within
the
meaning
of
that
word
for
begay
purposes,
so
too
escape
from
a
maximum
security
federal
prison,
which
in
some
sense
is
just
running
away,
but
it
is
extremely
aggressive
and
it's
extremely
risky
to
others.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
kagan,
that's
a
difficult
question.
i
don't
know
that
i've
seen
any
attempt
to
fit
that
offense
in
under
the
acca.
i
think
that
drag
racing,
where
you're
talking
about
speeds
of
150,
160,
170
miles
an
hour,
might
qualify,
but
i
haven't
seen
any
cases
like
that.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
--
again,
i--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
i
think
then
we
have
a
serious
question
about
the
first
part
of
the
analysis
and
the
--
the
risk
test.
i
mean,
10,
15
miles
over
--
i
mean,
speeding
as
a
generic
offense
is
likely
to
--
i
mean,
it
encompasses
categorically
all
speeding
offenses,
many
of
which
are
not
that
--
not
likely
to
pose
a
serious
risk
to
others.
so
i
--
i
--
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
--
the
data.
what
we
do
have
here
is
data
that
says
this
offense
is
four
times
as
risky
as
the
enumerated
offense
of
arson.
so
i
--
i
--
speeding
would
be
a
difficult
case.
so
far
as
i
know
we
--
the
government's
never
tried
to
make
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
not
as
far
as
i
know,
not
the
basic
offense.
now,
whether
in
a
begay-type
sense
you
might
have
some
recidivism
enhancement
under
state
law
that
would
get
you
there,
i
don't
know.
but
i
--
again,
i
haven't
seen
any
case
that
involved
that.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's
right.
that's
the
offense
here.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
it's
the
vehicular
flight
offense.
and
one
--
you
know,
i
will
take
one
issue
with
--
with
--
you
know,
what
my
friend
on
the
other
side
has
said,
which
is
(a)
and
(b)
are
not
tiered,
they're
not
greater
and
lesser
offenses
under
state
law.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
yes.
it's
a
tougher
case,
but
we
would
be
here
saying
that,
because
when
you're
looking
at
an
offense
categorically,
for
instance
arson,
you've
got
to
look
at
all
fires,
all
intentionally
set
fires,
the
ones
that
don't
hurt
anybody,
the
ones
that
do,
and
the
ones
that
kill
people,
even
though
the
fires
that
kill
people
will
be
prosecutable
in
most
jurisdictions
as
a
greater
offense,
like
felony
murder.
and
so
when
you're
looking
at
it
categorically
you
have
got
to
look
at
all
of
the
conduct
in
that
category,
even
conduct
that
may
be
prosecutable
under
some
greater
offense.
i
think,
you
know,
the
other
side
sort
of
relies
on
this
assumption
that
all
conduct
which
might
satisfy
the
greater
will
necessarily
be
prosecuted
under
the
greater;
and
as
a
legal
matter,
it's
included
within
the
lesser
and
as
a
factual
matter
it's
just
not
true
that
it
always
gets
prosecuted
under
that
greater
offense.
so
it
would
be
a
tougher
case.
it
would
make
our
case
more
difficult,
but
i
think
legally
and
factually
the
government's
answer
would
be
the
same.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
my
state
law
research
is
a
little
different
from
your
clerk's.
i've
got
37
states
and
d.c.
but
the
--
the
point
is
that
under
the
nested
statutes,
the
aggravator
isn't
always
like
this
one,
risk.
sometimes
it's,
as
in
indiana,
injury
or
death.
and
where
you're
talking
about
actual
injury
or
death,
those
aggravators
far
outstrip
the
level
of
potential
risk
that
acca
requires.
so
i
don't
think
in
those
states
petitioner
would
give
an
argument
that
those
aggravators
would
affect
at
all
the
analysis
of
the
basic
offense.
there
are
a
handful
of
states
that,
unlike
indiana,
have
as
an
aggravator
risk,
though
even
some
of
those
states
treat
the
basic
offense
as
a
felony,
which
is
i
think
a
judgment
by
the
state
that,
even
in
the
basic
case
this
is
risky
conduct,
deserving
of
severe
punishment
under
state
law.
so,
you
know,
there
are
nested
statutes.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
i
mean
i
--
again,
i
think
it
is
significant
that
in
1998
the
general
assembly
broke
this
out
as
a
separate
subsection
and
said:
we're
not
even
going
to
require
prosecutors
to
prove
risk.
i
think
that
represents
a
judgment
by
the
state
that
the
conduct
is
risky
on
a
typical
basis.
we
just
want
the
state
to
prove
you
used
a
vehicle.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
that's
right,
and
the
reason--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--the
reason
you
shouldn't,
justice
scalia,
is
because
that's
the
kind
of
purposeful,
violent,
and
aggressive
conduct
the
state
wants
to
deter
by
treating
as
a
felony.
but
i
--
i
mean
i
--
whether
one
looks
at
the
risk
prong
and
the
data
and
the
cases
in
indiana
or
elsewhere,
or
whether
one
looks
at
the
character
of
the
conduct,
this
offense
is
just
different
in
both
degree
and
kind
from
the
offenses
that
this
court
has
said
fall
outside
of
acca's
residual
clause.
it's
much
more
like
escape
from
custody,
it's
much
more
like
the
enumerated
offenses.
indeed,
the
risk
of
confrontation
is
certain.
i
mean,
i
--
it's
important,
i
think,
that
--
i
mean
i
--
these
flights
are
not
calm
affairs.
they're
dangerous
events.
the
average
speed
that
the
offender
is
traveling
nationwide
is
25
miles
an
hour
over
the
speed
limit.
this
is
someone
who
on
average
is
young,
unlicensed,
influenced
by
alcohol--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--mr.
chief
justice,
that's
right.
i
think
police
agencies
have
been
struggling
with
this
question,
which
is
why
there's
a
lot
of
data
on
police
pursuits,
frankly,
especially
in
the
last
10
or
15
years.
i
think
some
of
them
are
becoming
more
restrictive,
and
so
the
data
picks
up
pursuits.
it
doesn't
pick
up
all
flights.
and
i
think
if
there
were
sound
evidence
that
when
people
were
not
pursued
they
were
actually
driving
at
low
speeds
and
safely,
that
would
affect
the
data,
though
not
so
much
that
it
would
move
it
outside
of
similarity
to
the
enumerated
offenses.
but
i
think
the
--
the
--
the
data
is
pretty
good
in
indicating
that
the
typical
flight
is
--
really
does
pose
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
others,
a
risk
that
materializes
more
often
than
with
other
crimes
that
congress
clearly
intended
to
fall
within
the
acca.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
yes,
the
government
would
say
it
is,
justice
alito.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
no,
justice
alito.
the
government's
answer
is
that
categorically
the
behavior
is
aggressive
and
that
in
some
cases
it
will
result
in
injury
or
death
and
in
some
it
will
not,
but
in
all
cases
it
carries
that
potential.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--chief
justice,
there's
no
question
that
on
a
case
by
case
basis
you
could
flee
in
a
way
that
was
not
very
risky,
that
was
not
very
violent,
or
not
very
aggressive.
and
if
this
court
went
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
then
we'd
look
at
the
conduct
here
and
the
government
would
still
win,
because
this
is
the
typical
case.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
and
i
--
my--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--yes,
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
but
categorically,
which
is
what
this
court
looks
at,
the
conduct
encompassed
by
the
elements
in
the
ordinary
case,
in
the
ordinary
case,
the
character
of
the
conduct
is
aggressive.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
i
don't
know
that
he
is
aggressing
against
anyone,
in
the
same
way
that
if
i
recklessly
i
fire
a
gun
into
a
large
crowd
of
people,
you
know,
i
haven't
aggressed
against
anyone
in
particular.
he's
aggressed
into
anyone
who
strays
into
his
field
of
flight
and
who
could
be
injured
by
what
is
typically
a
high-speed
flight
and
pursuit.
so
i
don't
--
there
is
no
specific
target,
but
that
will
be
true
of
many
of
the
crimes
that
are
violent
felonies,
that
the
--
that
the
aggressive
nature
of
the
conduct
is
directed
generally.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
so,
too,
with
the
burglar,
who
hopes
that
no
one
will
come
home;
maybe
even
the
arsonist
who
hopes
no
one
is
in
the
house;
or
the
extortionist
who
hopes
someone
will
pay,
so
he
won't
have
to
use
violence.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's
right,
justice
scalia,
a
residual
clause
that,
as
you
yourself
have
recognized,
is
extremely
broadly
worded.
it
--
it
abstracts
out
as
the
quality
of
the
enumerated
offenses
that
they
create
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
others.
and
i
can't
find
any
metric
along
which
flight
doesn't
do
that,
whether
one
looks
through
the
cases,
media
reports,
the
statistical
data,
whatever
one
--
indiana,
nationally
--
whatever
standard
or
metric
one
uses,
this
is
an
extremely
risky
offense
to
others.
and
i,
you
know
--
so
it's
very
difficult
to
figure
out
what
test,
what
interpretation
of
that
language
would
exclude
this
from
acca.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
breyer
the--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--the
states--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--the
states
treat
it
differently.
some,
as
indiana--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
so.
if
the
court
were
to
affirm
here,
what
that
would
mean
is
that
the
offense
of
flight
is
a
violent
felony
insofar
as
you
have
a
predicate
conviction
under
a
state
statute
where
it's
been
punishable
by
up
to
a
year,
and
so
it
could
qualify
for
acca
coverage.
now,
some
state
convictions
will
have
been
treated
as
misdemeanors
and
won't
be
eligible
for
acca,
but
to
the
extent
the
state
treats
it
as
a
felony
it's
risky
enough
to
satisfy
the
residual
clause.
now,
if
the
court
treats
(a)
and
(b)
as
what
they
are
not,
which
is
greater
or
lesser,
then
yes,
i
think
there
will
be
problems
with
various
state
statutes,
as
justice
kagan
pointed
out,
and
this
court
may
have
to
clear
it
up
down
the
road.
but
if
it
treats
this
basic
offense
as
what
it
is,
not
a
greater
or
lesser,
but
alternative
means
of
proving
a
single
offense
that
is
risky,
that
would,
i
think,
would
take
care
of
all
flight
cases
going
forward.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
yes,
justice
kagan,
if
you're
looking
only
--
i
take
it
you're
looking
only
at
the
vehicle
prong
of
(b),
but
the
test
in
schmuck
is
whether
it's
impossible
to
--
to
commit
the
greater
without
committing
the
lesser.
it's
not
impossible
to
commit
(b),
because
it
does
have
the
two
other
prongs,
and
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
the
--
there
is
no
evidence
--
no
case
in
indiana
that
i'm
aware
of.
there's
no
evidence
that
the
general
assembly
intended
these
to
be
multiple
punishments
for
a
single
incident.
there
are
alternative
means
of
proving
a
single
offense.
the
state
has
always
treated
them
that
way,
so
far
as
i
can
tell.
i've
not
--
i've
seen
prosecutions
since
1998
that
were
all
under
(a).
i
haven't
seen
anything
that
went
under
(a)
and
(b)
and
tried
to
get
multiple
punishments,
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
serious
problem.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
your
honor,
the
government
does
not
think
that
(a)
is
a
lesser
included
of
(b).
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
the
element
of
(b)
that's
different,
justice
sotomayor,
is
the
"while
committing
any
offense
described
in
subsection
(a).
"
so
you
can
be
resisting
an
officer
or
you
can
be
obstructing
the
service
of
process
and
you
can
endanger
someone
in
various
ways,
including
with
a
vehicle,
and
you
will
have
violated
(b),
and
you
can
be
prosecuted
for
that,
and
there
are
cases
in
indiana
like
that.
and
you
have
not
--
you
have
not
been
fleeing
in
a
vehicle
from
an
officer
at
any
point,
so
you
haven't
violated
(a).
so
the
existence
of
the
other
prong
there
--
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
into
with
justice
kagan
--
means
that
this
is
not
a
greater
or
lesser
under
schmuck.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
if
you
divided
up
the
prongs
under
schmuck,
but
i
think
the
schmuck
--
what
follows
logically
from
that
test
is
that
you
look
at
the
entire
offense
and
ask
whether
it's
possible
to
commit
it
without
committing
the
lesser,
and
that
test
is
not
satisfied
here.
i
don't
think
you
carve
it
up
prong
by
prong.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
no,
it's
greater
or
lesser
for
purposes
of
petitioner's
argument
that
you
should
assume
that
every
risky
flight
gets
prosecuted
under
(b)
and
hence
(a)
is
a
non-risky
offense,
and
that
argument
fails
for
multiple
reasons,
one
of
which
i
was
trying
to
spin
out.
it's
not
even
true
that
this
is
greater
or
lesser.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
except
that
there
are
two
alternative
means
of
proving
the
same
offense
under
state
law.
they
have
the
same
state
law
penalties,
so
the
prosecutors
can
go
under
(a)
or
they
can
go
under
(b).
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
for
the
last,
say,
13
years,
they've
been
going
under
--
they've
been
going
under
(a).
so
it's
not
--
justice
scalia,
it's
not
--
there
are
aggravators
in
this
statute
for
injury
or
death.
they're
the
ones
that
are
in
(2)
and
(3),
the
class
(c)
and
class
(b)
felonies,
but
this
is
not
a
greater
or
lesser.
it's
--
they're
alternative
means.
i
think
only
if
you've
got
--
set
that
aside
would
you
get
to
the
sort
of
schmuck
analysis
that
i
was
going
through
with
--
with
justice
kagan.
i
think
one
of
the
important
things
to
recognize
about
this
offense
is
that,
you
know,
in
the
--
50
percent
of
these
offenders
are
ultimately
charged
with
a
violation
that's
unrelated
to
their
flight,
a
serious
felony
unrelated
to
their
flight.
and
the
reason
i
think
that's
important
is
because
what
you
will
look
--
the
reason
that
they're
traveling
at
such
high
speeds,
the
reason
they're
evading
officers,
the
reason
the
typical
case
is
not
someone
just
going
a
couple
blocks
and
stopping,
is
because
they've
got
drugs
in
the
car
or
guns,
they
have
parole
violations
or
outstanding
warrants.
it
is
the
background
against
which
i
think
you
have
to
assess
the
character
of
the
--
of
the
conduct
here.
and
whether
you're
looking
at
it
under
risk
or
under
the
character
of
the
conduct,
the
government
submits
that
it
easily
satisfies
the
residual
clause.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
