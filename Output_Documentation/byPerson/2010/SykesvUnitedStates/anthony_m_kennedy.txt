justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
sure
you'll
do
so
in
the
course
of
your
argument,
but
at
some
point
give
us
some
examples
of
violations
of
--
of
this,
this
statute,
which
from
a
commonsense
standpoint
don't
involve
a
serious
risk.
there
was
something
in
the
brief
about,
oh,
well,
the
defendant
might
want
to
just
find
a
safe
place
to
pull
over.
i
--
i
didn't
follow
that
because
it's
an
intent
crime.
i
just
don't
see
how
that
would
be
a
violation.
but
if
at
some
point
in
your
argument
you
could
address
those
points.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
supposed
to
stop
dead
in
your
tracks
and
not
pull
off
on
the
shoulder?
i
mean,
i
don't
--
i
just
don't
understand
this.
i'll
go
read
the
case,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--maybe
that's
why
--
why
it's
a
risk.
you
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
then
everybody--
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case,
sykes
versus
united
states,
is
another
in
a
series
of
cases
the
court
has
decided
under
a
federal
statute
known
as
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
and
that
statute
is
commonly
referred
to
as
acca.
acca
makes
it
a
federal
crime
for
convicted
felon
to
be
in
unlawful
possession
of
a
firearm.
now,
the
ordinary
maximum
sentence
is
10
years
of
imprisonment.
but
if
--
when
the
unlawful
possession
occurred,
the
felon
had
three
previous
convictions
for
a
violent
felony,
then
acca
increases
the
punishment
to
a
minimum
term
of
15
years.
this
case
presents
the
issue
whether
flight
from
the
police,
when
the
felon
uses
a
vehicle
to
flee,
is
a
violent
felony
under
acaa.
the
court
of
the
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
found
that
it
is.
we
agree
and
we
affirm.
in
determining
whether
an
offense
is
a
violent
felony,
the
court
employs
a
categorical
approach.
that
means
it
looks
to
the
elements
of
the
offense
as
a
general
matter
not
to
the
particular
facts
in
the
record
of
conviction.
acca
prescribes
that
a
prior
conviction
qualifies
if
it
is
a
crime
enumerated
in
the
statute,
then
there's
a
final
clause,
a
residual
clause
and
that
residual
clause
says
that
an
act
is
a
violent
felony
if
it
otherwise
involves
conduct
that
presents
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
the
question
is
whether
a
felon
who
uses
a
vehicle
to
flee
from
the
police
is
covered
by
this
residual
clause
and
so,
this
case
requires
us
to
determine
if
vehicle
flight
from
a
police
officer
presents
a
serious
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
sykes
was
convicted
of
vehicle
flight
under
indiana
law,
and
that
introduces
a
slight
complication,
and
that's
because
indiana
has
a
statute
with
a
separate
provision
for
using
a
vehicle
to
resist
law
enforcement
office
--
law
enforcement
in
a
variety
of
ways
including
flight,
where
that
resistance
involves
a
substantial
risk
of
bodily
injury
to
--
to
another.
both
relevant
provisions
carry
the
same
penalties
however,
so
they
do
not
reflect
an
expectation
that
risky
vehicle
flights
will
be
prosecuted
only
under
the
separate
provision.
we
hold
that
the
bar
in
flight
from
police,
when
the
defender
uses
a
vehicle
to
flee,
involves
a
level
of
risk
that
qualifies
it
as
a
violent
felony
for
acaa
purposes.
the
--
the
determination
of
the
fleeing
suspect
to
elude
capture,
show
--
shows
an
inherent
lack
of
concern
for
others'
safety.
however,
he
drives,
the
criminal
attempting
to
elude
capture,
creates
the
possibility
that
the
police
will,
in
a
legitimate
and
lawful
manner,
accelerate
or
use
force
to
bring
him
within
their
custody.
although
not
dispositive,
statistics
confirm
this
commonsense
conclusion,
for
instance,
personal
injury
rates
for
arson
and
burglary
are
about
20%
lower
than
they
are
for
vehicle
flight.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
kagan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joins.
