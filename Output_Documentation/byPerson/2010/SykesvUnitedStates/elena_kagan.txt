mr.
marsh,
i
take
it
that
you
would
agree
that
(b)(1)(b)
is
a
violent
felony
under
--
under
acca;
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
if
we
think
that
(b)(1)(b)
is
a
violent
felony
under
acca
and
we
know
that
(b)(1)(a)
and
(b)(1)(b)
can
receive
the
same
punishment,
that
they're
both
classed
as
a
class
d
felony,
why
should
we
make
the
distinction
between
the
two
under
acca?
justice
elena
kagan
but
these
are
not
nested
offenses.
these
are
not
--
these
are
not
lesser
included
offenses.
each
has
an
element
that
the
other
lacks,
and
both
are
classed
with
--
apparently
that
the
--
that
the
state
thinks
of
them
as
equally
severe.
and
if
one
is
a
violent
felony
under
acca,
there's
an
argument
that
the
other
should
be
treated
in
the
exact
same
way.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
wall,
wouldn't
that
suggest
that
if
i
just
ran
from
a
police
officer,
it
would
be
a
violent
felony
under
acca?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
wall,
do
you
think
that
speeding
or
drag
racing
qualifies
under
your
understanding
of
the
test?
justice
elena
kagan
but
mr.
wall,
suppose
they
were?
i
understand
your
point
that
they're
not,
and
you
might
be
right
about
that.
but
let's
suppose
that
they
were.
let's
suppose
you
had
a
three-tier
set-up.
one
was
simple
flight;
one
was
flight
that
causes
risk
of
injury;
one
that
is
a
flight
that
causes
injury.
and
let's
even
say
that
the
simple
flight
--
no,
let's
--
let's
call
them
all
felonies,
but
different
classes
of
felonies.
what
would
happen
in
that
case?
would
you
still
be
here
saying
that
the
simple
flight
felony
is
a
violent
crime?
justice
elena
kagan
i
--
i
asked
my
clerk
to
just
do
a
survey
of
the
states,
and
he
came
up
with
--
and
i'm
sure
that
this
is
rough
--
but
that
46
of
the
states
have
these
tiered
systems.
now,
there
may
be
some
questions
as
to
some
of
them,
like
you've
raised
some
questions
about
indiana's,
but
that
46
states
essentially
conceive
of
this
as
two
different
kinds
of
conduct,
one
which
is
the
violent
kind
and
the
other
which
is
the
not
violent
crime.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
on
this
question
of
whether
this
statute
is
greater
or
lesser,
it's
greater
or
lesser
if
you
just
understand
(b)(1)(a)
as
confined
to
vehicular
flight.
in
other
words,
if
one
looks
only
at
vehicular
flight,
then
(b)(1)(a)
and
(b)(1)(b)
are
indeed
greater
or
lesser
offenses.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
think
that
if
i
flee
in
a
vehicle,
i
could
be
prosecuted
under
both
and
receive
sentences
under
both?
justice
elena
kagan
but
as
a
vehicular
flight
only,
it
would
be
greater
or
lesser.
