justice
antonin
scalia
what's
in
between?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
can
assume
that
the
conviction
here
did
not
involve
any
risk
of
bodily
injury
to
anybody?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
drive
in
indiana.
i
think
that's
pretty
tough.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
say
somebody
is
fleeing?
i
mean,
doesn't
fleeing
mean
you're
trying
to
escape
the
--
the
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
--
i
don't
know
how
we
could
proceed
by
looking
at,
you
know,
whether
in
fact
a
majority
of
the
cases
that
come
into
this
first
relatively
harmless
category
did
indeed
involve
situations
that
involved
physical
risk
because,
as
everybody
knows,
prosecutors
plea
bargain,
and
it's
probably
very
often
the
case
that
the
defendant
is
charged
only
under,
under
category
one,
you
know,
where
if
he
went
to
trial
they
would
charge
him
under
three;
isn't
that
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
yes,
you
want
to
say
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
presume
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it
may
well
be
that
in
deciding
whether
to
accept
a
plea
bargain
of
being
guilty
of
(a)
rather
than
going
to
trial
on
b,
if
your
client
has
two
violent
felonies
already
on
the
book,
you
might
take
--
take
the
plea
bargain
under
(a)
lest
you
run
afoul
of
the
violent
felony
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
that
question.
i
would
have
thought
that
your
answer
if
you're
insisting
on
a
categorical
approach
would
be
no,
that
there's
nothing
in,
in
(3)
that
requires
any
violence
at
all.
just
fleeing
by
visible
or
audible
means,
just,
just
flees,
that's
all
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
good
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
if
we
agreed
with
you
that
whether
it
is
a
violent
crime
depends
upon
what
other
prosecutions
for
fleeing
could
have
been
drawn.
if
we
agree
with
you
that
(1)(a)
is
negligible
because
there
are
other
bigger
ones
for
which
he
wasn't
charged,
we
could
leave
open
the
question
of
what
--
what
happens
in
a
state
that
has
only
one
crime
for
fleeing,
and
we
would
--
then
we
would
have
to
confront
the
question
that
justice
sotomayor
has
asked.
but
if
we
accept
your
notion
that
--
where
you
have
a
gradation
that
is
adopted
by
the
state,
the
lowest
gradation
cannot
be
determined
to
have
a
high
percentage
of
bodily
risk,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
were
all
litigated
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you
have
a
state
that
has
a
separate
crime
for
trespassing,
criminal
trespass,
and
you're
saying
that
if
--
if
you
could
show
that
a
large
number
of
cases
that
were
brought
under
criminal
trespass
in
fact
could
have
been
prosecuted
under
burglary,
then
criminal
trespass
would
qualify
as
a
--
as
a
violent
felony.
that
doesn't
seem
--
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
because
prosecutors
make
that
choice,
that
doesn't
establish
that
the
elements
of
the
crime,
which
is
what
we
focus
on
in
deciding
whether
it's
a
violent
felony,
fill
the
bill.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
--
do
words
mean
nothing?
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
a
violent
felony.
that's
what
the
federal
law
requires.
and
--
and
you
want
us
to
hold
that
failing
to
stop
when
a
police
officer
tells
you
to
stop
is
a
violent
felony.
that
--
that
seems
to
me
a
--
a
--
a
big
leap.
i
mean,
words
have
some
meaning,
and
congress
focused
on
violent
felonies.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
speeding,
just
--
you
know,
you're
going
15
miles
over
the
speed
limit?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
violent
felony?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
necessarily
risky.
conduct
that
shows
disrespect
for
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
even
if
it
isn't
risky,
you
should
not
thumb
your
nose
at
the
police
when
they
tell
you
to
stop.
justice
antonin
scalia
risky
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he's
saying
even
when
it's
risky
it's
not
aggressive.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
be
risky
and
not
aggressive,
can't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they're
mentioned;
they're
mentioned.
they're
mentioned,
and
you're
trying
to
get
this
in
under
the
residual
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
--
this
is
greater
or
lesser
for
purposes
of
what?
double
jeopardy?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
don't
follow
that
argument.
i
mean,
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that,
yes,
you
could
--
you
could
run
afoul
of
(b)
by
committing
an
offense
under
subsection
little
(a)
in
some
other
ways,
but
if
you
run
afoul
of
(b)
by
committing
the
offense
of
--
of
flight
from
a
law
enforcement
officer,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
automatically
includes
(a).
