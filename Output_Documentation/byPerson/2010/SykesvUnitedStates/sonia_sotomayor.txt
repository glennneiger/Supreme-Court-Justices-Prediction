justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
do
you
know
if
indiana
has
an
enhancement
for
convictions,
sentencing
enhancement
of
any
kind,
for
conviction
that
have
an
element
of
risk
of
harm
to
others?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
possible
that
there
is
a
--
there's
a
use
of
the
difference
between
the
two
categories
that
might
not
be
implicated
in
this
case,
but
may
lay
the
foundation
for
an
enhancement
later?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
your
brief
you
take
issue
with
the
government's
definition
of
"aggressive",
but
would
you
give
us
yours?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
would
you
define
it
and
on
what
basis?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
have
you
done
or
looked
at
--
not
every
burglary
has
a
risk
of
harm
to
another
or
results
in
harm
to
another.
the
general
definition
of
burglary
is
entering
without
permission
and
intent
to
commit
a
crime,
and
generically
the
crime
doesn't
have
to
be
physical
injury
to
others.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yet
acca
defines
burglary
as
a
qualifying
crime
of
violence.
it's
measuring
risk,
not
by
the
elements
of
that
crime,
but
by
something
else,
by
some
measure
of
incidents
in
which
violence
might
occur.
so
how
is
that
different
than
the
government's
argument
here
and
the
question
that
justice
breyer
asked
you,
which
was:
it
is
true,
potentially
there's
some
forms
of
fleeing
that
might
not
pose
a
risk
of
injury,
but
statistically
there's
a
large
number
of
incidents
in
which
violence
follows.
so
how
is
that
different
than
burglary?
that's
really
my
question.
what
--
it
can't
be
that
the
elements
have
to
pose
a
risk
of
injury,
because
burglary
doesn't
do
that.
so
what
--
how
do
we
measure
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
you're
not
doing
that,
that's
my
question:
where
do
we
draw
the
line?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
do
we
draw
the
line?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
that
was
what
justice
breyer
was
trying
to
ask
you
earlier,
which
is:
when
do
we
say
that,
as
in
burglary,
that
some
risk
is
more
likely
to
follow
than
not
in
a
particular
type
of
crime?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
ignores
the
in-kind
requirement
of
begay,
because
you
seem
to
be
confusing
the
risk
of
violence
with
the
in-kind
inquiry,
and
that's
where
i'm
trying
--
i
would
like
you
to
concentrate
a
little
bit
on,
which
is
in
burglary
the
defendant
is
breaking
into
generally
a
place
and
going
without
permission,
with
an
intent
to
commit
a
crime.
how
is
that
comparable
to
merely
not
stopping
when
a
police
officer
tells
you
not
to
stop?
how
is
that
an
in-kind--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
you're
doing
is
saying
i'm
not
--
you're
not
even
saying
i'm
not
stopping,
you're
just
driving
away.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
how
is
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
that's
the
risk
of--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
--
that
--
that
is
all
the
risk
question,
and
you're
confusing
the
police
actions
with
the
defendant's,
because
you're
talking
about
the
defendant
responding
to
a
police
pursuit.
so
what
--
what
is
in
the
act
of
the
crime
that
makes
it
in-kind
to
burglary?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
concentrate
on
burglary
because
the
others
don't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--james
--
james
predated
begay.
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
a
little
confused
by
what
you
said
and
what
point
you're
making.
you
don't
think
that
(b)
is
a
lesser
included
of
(a)?
is
that
--
no,
that
(a)
is
a
lesser
included
of
(b)?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
can't
commit
(b)
without
committing
(a)
first.
(b)
has
just
one
additional
element,
but
all
of
the
elements
of
(a)
are
part
of
the
elements
of
(b),
so
how
can
it
not
be
a
lesser
included?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
succinctly
tell
me
how
this
is
any
less
purposeful,
aggressive,
or
violent
than
escape
from
custody?
what's
your
best
answer
to
why
this
is
just
not
identical
to
escape,
which
is
a
fleeing-from
situation
just
as
this
is.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
here
an
officer
has
told
you
to
stop.
they're
trying
to
effect
custody.
i
don't
know
what
the
aggression
or
violence
is,
other
than,
you
know,
breaking
a
window,
doing
something.
it
doesn't
require,
the
escape,
that
you
actually
injure
someone
to
get
out.
it's
just
that
you
run
away.
