justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
the
problem
with
your
argument
is
that
the
prosecution
is
not
under
any
obligation
to
charge
any
offense
greater
than
the
offense
for
which
your
client
was
convicted
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
very
grave
risk
created
by
flight.
isn't
that
true?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
fact
that
someone
is
convicted
of
this
offense
does
not
show
that
a
broad
category
of
offenses
within
this
crime
lack
the
risk
that's
necessary
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
called
hape
v.
state
in
the
indiana
court
of
appeals
2009?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
hape.
h-a-p-e.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
during
a
45
--
and
this
involved
the
offense
at
issue
here.
during
a
45-minute
high-speed
chase
officers
shot
at
the
defendant's
truck
at
least
20
times.
the
state's
facts
showed
that
the
defendant
drove
over
100
miles
an
hour
and
at
times
drove
into
the
oncoming
traffic
lane.
do
you
think
that
creates
a
--
a
serious
potential
risk
of
--
of
harm?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
believe
he
is
convicted
of
the
same
offense
as
--
as
mr.
sykes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
legislature
were
to
repeal
(b)(1)(b).
would
the
offense
for
which
mr.
sykes
was
convicted
then
become
an
acca
offense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
it's
the
opposite.
if
the
aggravated
offense
--
you
rely
on
the
aggravated
offense--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--in
large
part
as
a
basis
for
your
argument.
your
argument
--
one
of
your
main
arguments,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
what
i'll
call
the
simple
offense
doesn't
qualify
under
acca
because
cases
involving
a
serious
risk
of
bodily
injury
fall
under
the
aggravated
category,
and
my
question
is
whether
a
repeal
of
the
aggravated
offense
would
change
--
would
then
convert
the
simple
offense
from
a
non-acca
offense
to
an
acca
offense.
or
you
could
ask
it
a
different
way.
if
state
one
has
the
simple
offense
and
the
aggravated
offense,
state
two
has
just
the
simple
offense,
is
the
simple
offense
an
acca
offense
in
one
state
and
not
in
the
other
state
even
though
the
elements
are
exactly
the
same?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you're
answering
my
question
by
making
a
totally
different
argument.
insofar
as
you're
relying
on
the
aggravated
offense,
the
presence
of
the
aggravated
offense,
i
would
appreciate
an
answer
to
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
--
maybe
i
haven't
made
myself
clear.
justice
scalia's
answer,
which
you
have
adopted,
is
that
if
you
look
at
(a)
by
itself,
forget
about
the
aggravated
offense
completely,
it
doesn't
qualify
under
acca,
and
that's
--
that's
one
argument.
but
your
other
argument
is
that
(a),
the
simple
offense,
doesn't
qualify
because
of
the
presence
of
(b).
and
i'm
trying
to
just
see
whether
that
makes
sense.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
still
an
empirical
question?
if
we
were
to
look
at
all
of
the
cases
that
are
prosecuted
under
what
i'll
call
the
simple
offense,
we
might
discover
that
those
are
all
cases
in
which
there
is
no
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
created
because
all
of
the
risky
cases
are
prosecuted
under
the
aggravated
label.
we
might
also
find
that
there
are
still
a
great
many
cases
that
involve
a
serious
potential
risk
that
are
prosecuted
under
the
simple
category.
so
the
fact
that
there's
a
gradation
doesn't
allow
us
to
escape
the
empirical
issue,
does
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
wouldn't
say
that
they
didn't
have
a
rational
basis
for
dividing
it.
it
would
just
show
a
pattern
of
prosecution
and
plea
bargaining.
that's
what
it
would
show.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
never
is
really
reliable
empirical
data,
almost
never,
for
any
of
the
issues
that
have
to
be
decided
under
the
--
the
catch-all,
the
residual
clause,
of
acca.
it
has
to
be
based
on
basically
common
sense
and
experience,
doesn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
speeding
a
felony?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
this:
if
a
person
is
convicted
of
vehicular
flight
that
causes
death,
is
that
aggressive
conduct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
the
conduct
there
any
different
from
the
conduct
when
death
doesn't
result?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
not
true.
there
are
--
you
can
--
there
are
prison
escapes
all
the
time
where
it
is
done
through
subterfuge.
