mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
california
law
at
issue
today
before
this
court
differs
from
the
new
york
law
at
issue
in
ginsberg
in
only
one
respect.
where
new
york
was
concerned
with
minors'
access
to
harmful
sexual
material
outside
the
guidance
of
a
parent,
california
is
no
less
concerned
with
a
minor's
access
to
the
deviant
level
of
violence
that
is
presented
in
a
certain
category
of
video
games
that
can
be
no
less
harmful
to
the
development
of
minors.
when
this
court
in
ginsberg
crafted
a
rule
of
law
that
permits
states
to
regulate
a
minor's
access
to
such
material
outside
the
presence
of
a
parent,
it
did
so
for
two
fundamental
reasons
that
are
equally
applicable
this
morning
in
this
case.
first,
this
rule
permits
parents'
claim
to
authority
in
their
own
household
to
direct
the
upbringing
and
development
of
their
children;
and
secondly,
this
rule
promotes
the
state's
independent
interest
in
helping
parents
protect
the
wellbeing
of
children
in
those
instances
when
parents
cannot
be
present.
so
this
morning,
california
asks
this
court
to
adopt
a
rule
of
law
that
permits
states
to
restrict
minors'
ability
to
purchase
deviant,
violent
video
games
that
the
legislature
has
determined
can
be
harmful
to
the
development--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--yes,
your
honor.
deviant
would
be
departing
from
established
norms.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
well,
i
think
if
we
look
back--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--agreed,
your
honor.
but
the
level
of
violence--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
no,
your
honor.
that's
why
i
believe
california
incorporated
the
three
prongs
of
the
miller
standard.
so
it's
not
just
deviant
violence.
it's
not
just
patently
offensive
violence.
it's
violence
that
meets
all
three
of
the
terms
set
forth
in--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--sure,
your
honor.
the
california
legislature
was
presented
with
substantial
evidence
that
demonstrates
that
the
interactive
nature
of
violent
--
of
violent
video
games
where
the
minor
or
the
young
adult
is
the
aggressor,
is
the
--
is
the
individual
acting
out
this
--
this
obscene
level
of
violence,
if
you
will,
is
especially
harmful
to
minors.
it--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--well,
in
the
record,
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
the
gentile
and
gentile
study
regarding
violent
video
games
as
exemplary
teachers.
the
authors
there
note
that
video
games
are
not
only
exemplary
teachers
of
pro-social
activities,
but
also
exemplary
teachers
of
aggression,
which
was
the
fundamental
concern
of
the
california
legislature
in
enacting
this
statute.
so
while
the
science
is
continually
developing,
indeed,
it
appears
that
studies
are
being
released
every
month
regarding--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--well,
your
honor,
there
is
scientific
literature
out
there
regarding
the
impact
of
violent
media
on
children.
in
fact,
for
decades,
the
president,
congress,
the
ftc,
parenting
groups,
have
been
uniquely
concerned
with
the
level
of
violent
media
available
to
minors
that
they
have
ready
access
to.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
no--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--justice
sotomayor,
cartoons
do
not
depart
from
the
established
norms
to
a
level
of
violence
to
which
children
have
been
historically
exposed
to.
we
believe
the
level
of
violence
in
these
video
games--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
the
beauty
of
incorporating
the
three
prongs
of
the
miller
standard
into
california's
law.
this
standard
is
very
prophylactic
and
ensures
that
only
a
narrow
category
of
material
will
be
covered,
certainly
not
grimm's
fairy
tales.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
your
honor,
california
submits
that
when
the
rights
of
minors
are
at
issue
and
not
the
rights
of
adults,
the
standard
should
be
more
flexible.
the
constitution
should
recognize
that
when
the
audience
is
minors
the
same
standard
should
not
apply.
therefore,
the
question
should
not
be
whether
or
not
historically
violent
speech
was
regulated,
but
whether
or
not
the
constitution
guarantees
minors
a
right.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
i
would
agree--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--i
would
agree
it's
egregious,
justice
sotomayor.
however--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--i'm
not
sure
initially
that
it's
directly
harmful
to
the
development
of
minors
in
the
way
that
we
know
that
violent
video
games
can
be.
we
know
that
violent
material,
like
sexual
material,
appeals
to
a
base
instinct
in
especially
minors.
it
has
--
it
can
be
presented
in
a
manner--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
that,
just
like
in
the
obscenity
context
for
minors,
a
law
similar
to
the
new
york
law
at
issue
in
ginsberg,
though
california's
law
hasn't
been
construed
or
applied,
i
would
submit
that
the
jury
would
be
instructed
to
consider
minors
as
a
whole.
in
california
that's
under
18
years
old.
so
i
believe
they
would
just
be
instructed
minors
as
a
class.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
your
honor,
i
think
juries
and
judges
do
this
every
day
in
the--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
rightfully
so.
i
think
a
jury
would
be
charged
with
perhaps
the
standard
of
what
the
community
believes
an
average
minor.
so
the
would
consider--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--fair
point,
justice
scalia.
i
think
a
jury
could
be
instructed
as
to
the
typical
age
group
of
minors
that
are
playing
these
games.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
justice
breyer,
absolutely.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
okay.
justice
kagan,
i
would
go
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
the
statute
covers
video
games
where
the
range
of
options
available
to
the
player
includes
maiming,
killing,
dismembering,
torturing,
sexually
assaulting,
and
those
types
of
violence.
so
i
would
look
to
games
where--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--no,
and
then
we
would
move
to
the
three
prongs
of
the
miller
standard,
your
honor.
we
would
look
to
see--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
a
jury
could
be
instructed
with
expert
testimony,
with
video
clips
of
game
play,
and
to
judge
for
themselves
whether--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--justice
scalia,
i
am
convinced
that
the
video
game
industry
will
know
what
to
do.
they
rate
their
video
games
every
day
on
the
basis
of
violence.
they
rate
them
for
the
intensity
of
the
violence.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
i
believe
that
some
mature-rated
games
would
be
covered,
but
not
all.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
but
not
all.
your
honor,
just
like
with
sexual
material,
we
can
--
we
can
trust
individual
panderers
of
sexual
material
to
judge
whether
or
not
it's
a--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--justice
kennedy,
as
with
sexual
--
the
regulation
of
sexual
material
and
obscenity,
we
had
to
start
somewhere.
california
is
choosing
to
start
now.
we
can
build
a
consensus
as
to
what
level
of
violence
is
in
fact
patently
offensive
for
minors,
is
deviant
for
minors,
just
as
the
case
law
has
developed
over
time
with
sexual
depictions.
your
honor,
i
believe
the
key
is
the
similarities
violence
has
with
sex.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
well,
justice
scalia,
i
would
like
to
highlight
the
fact
that
the
material
at
issue
in
ginsberg
was
not
obscene.
under
no
existing
definition
of
obscenity
was
the
partial
nudity
that
this
court
allowed
states
to
regulate
minors'
access
to--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--your
honor,
as
to
minors,
i
believe,
looking
at
some
of
the
historic
statutes
states
had
passed,
had
enacted
in
the
past,
there
was
a
social
recognition
that
there
is
a
level
of
violent
material--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--pardon?
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
earliest
statute
off
the
top
of
my
head.
i
believe
they
go
back
into
the
early
1900s,
perhaps
later.
i
apologize,
but
i
don't
know
that--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--absolutely.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
well,
justice
breyer,
i
think,
in
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
and
i
know
of
no
historical
evidence
that
suggests
that
our
founding
fathers
in
enacting
the
first
amendment
intended
to
guarantee
video
game
retailers
a
first
amendment
right--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
with
regard
to
fighting
words,
the
--
the
societal
interest
in
preventing
acts
of
violence
is
--
is
different
than
the
concern
at
issue
here
today.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
justice
kagan,
we
welcome
that
as
--
as
an
effect
of
california's
regulation,
but
the
primary
interest
was
the
internal
intrinsic
harm
to
minors.
that's
what
the
state
of
california
is
deeply
concerned
with
in
this
case.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
justice--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--yes,
justice
sotomayor.
they
found--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--well,
we
didn't,
your
honor,
because
one
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
hinged
upon
the
other.
in
striking
down
the
body
of
california's
law,
the
restriction
on
the
sales,
the
court
found
that
since
it's
not
illegal
to
sell
these
games
to
18-year-olds,
that
the
governmental
purpose
served
behind
the
label
itself
was
--
was
in
fact
misleading.
so
under
the
zadora
case
law,
i
don't
have
the
case
cite
before
me,
but
under
zadora
regarding
lawyers'
advertising
of
--
of
services,
it
--
the
government
can
require
the
labeling,
so
long
as
it's
necessary
to
prevent
misleading
the
consumer.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
because
they
struck
down
the
body
of
our
law,
that
the
18>
["]
label
would
be
misleading.
so--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--justice
sotomayor,
i
certainly
did
not
attempt
or
intend
to
concede
that
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
was
correct
in
any
sense
in
this
case.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
at
this
point,
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
your
honor,
under
ginsberg
they
are
entitled
to
direct
the
development
and
the
upbringing
of
their
children
in
the
manner
they
see
fit.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
it's
important
to
the
state
of
california
that
the
parent
--
that
we
ensure
that
the
parent
can
involve
themselves
in
this
important
decision.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
it's
one
of
the
two
fundamental
interests
that
are
served
by
this
law,
yes,
ensuring
that
parents
can
involve
themselves
in
the
front
end.
california
sought
to
erect
a
barrier
in
between
a
retail
sales
clerk
and
a
minor
with
regard
to
violent
material,
just
as
we
allow
for
minors'
access
to
sexual
material,
because
california
sees
that
the
developmental
harm
that
could
be
caused
to
minors
is
no
less
significant
than
that
recognized
by
this
court
in
--
in
ginsberg
with
regard
to
minors'
exposure
to
sexual
material.
now,
again,
the
material
at
issue
in
ginsberg
was
not
obscene.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
i
believe
california
has
a
law,
penal
code
section
3.3.1.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
yes.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
i'm
not
aware,
justice
alito.
but
there
is
a
proscription
on
the
sale
of
sexual
material
to
minors.
it
is
defined
as
harmful
to
minors,
similar
to
california's
act.
in
fact,
california's
act
in
incorporating
the
three
prongs
of
miller
goes
even
further
than
the
ginsberg
law
at
issue,
in
ginsberg,
new
york
law.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
your
honor,
we
--
we
ask
juries
to
judge
sexual
material
and
its
appropriateness
for
minors
as
well.
i
believe
that
if
--
if
we
can
view
the--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--justice
scalia,
california's
not
doing
that
here.
the
standard
is
quite
similar
to
that
in
the
sexual
material
realm.
california
is
not
acting
as
a
censor.
it
is
telling
manufacturers
and
distributors
to
look
at
your
material
and
to
judge
for
yourselves
whether
or
not
the
level
of
violent
content
meets
the
prongs
of
this
definition.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
your
honor,
i
believe
you
are
referring
to
the
parental
controls
that
are
available
on
some
of
the
new
machines?
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
as
we
submitted
in
our
briefing,
a
simple
internet
search
for
bypassing
parental
controls
brings
up
video
clips
instructing
minors
and
young
adults
how
to
b
pass
the
parental
controls.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
i
believe
the
v-chip
is
limited
to
television,
justice
kennedy.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
thank
you.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
wanted
to
address
one
point
that
has
been
raised
about
minors'
ability
to
access
these
games.
yes,
new
games
do
cost
$60,
but
california's
law
also
regulates
the
rental
of
these
video
games,
which
is
just
a
few
dollars
per
game.
so
minors
certainly
can
afford
them
and
can
access
them.
but
i
also
wanted
to
draw
out
the
point
that
california's
law
really
is
not
an
ordinance
that
is
directed
to
a
plot
of
a
game.
it's
expressly
directed
to
games
with
essentially
no
plot,
no
artistic
value.
this
is
the
helpful
nature
of
the
third
prong
of
the
miller
standard.
so
it
really
is
only
going
after
the
nature
of
the
game
where
the
child
is--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--that
would
be
one
factor
to
be
considered,
justice
scalia.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
the
nature
of
a
plot.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
no,
your
honor.
as
this
court
held
in
the
jacobilus
case,
a
single
quotation
from
voltaire
on
the
fly
leaf
of
an
otherwise
obscene
work
was
not
going
to
make
that
work
non-obscene.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
if
the
level
of
the
violence
just
as
an
obscenity,
if
the
level
of
violence
causes
the
game
as
a
whole
to
lack
the
artistic,
it
is
a
balance,
your
honor,
just
as
it
is
with
sexual
material.
each
aspect
--
that
is
why
violence
and
sex--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--again,
minors
as
a
class.
so
those
under
18-years-old.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
i
believe
it's
a
candidate,
your
honor,
but
i
haven't
played
the
game
and
been
exposed
to
it
sufficiently
to
judge
for
myself.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
justice
kagan,
by
candidate,
i
meant
that
the
video
game
industry
should
look
at
it,
should
take
a
long
look
at
it.
but
i
don't
know
off
the
top
of
my
head.
i'm
willing
to
state
right
here
in
open
court
that
the
video
game
postal
ii,
yes,
would
be
covered
by
this
act.
i'm
willing
to
guess
that
games
we
describe
in
our
brief
such
as
madworld
would
be
covered
by
the
act.
i
think
the
video
game
industry--
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
--no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor,
because
the
act
is
only
directed
towards
the
range
of
options
that
are
able
to
be
inflicted
on
a
human
being.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
under
the
act,
yes,
because
california's
concern,
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
sex
and
violence
are
so
similar,
these
are
base
physical
acts
we
are
talking
about,
justice
sotomayor.
so
limiting,
narrowing
our
law
here
in
california,
there
in
california
to
violence
--
violent
depictions
against
human
beings.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
i
would
think
so.
the
intent
of
the
law
is
to
limit
minors'
access
to
those
games.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
your
honor,
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
this
statute
has
not
been
applied
and
not
even
been
construed
by
a
state
or
federal
court
below,
but.
mr.
zackery
p.
morazzini
thank
you.
