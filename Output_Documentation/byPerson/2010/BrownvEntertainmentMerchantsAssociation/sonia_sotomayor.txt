i
don't
think;
is
that
answering
justice
kagan's
question?
one
of
the
studies,
the
anderson
study,
says
that
the
effect
of
violence
is
the
same
for
a
bugs
bunny
episode
as
it
is
for
a
violent
video.
so
can
the
legislature
now,
because
it
has
that
study,
say
we
can
outlaw
bugs
bunny?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
are
people
who
would
say
that
a
cartoon
has
very
little
social
value;
it's
entertainment,
but
not
much
else.
this
is
entertainment.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
i
like
this
video,
the
one
at
issue
that
you
provided
the
five-minute
clip
about.
to
me,
it's
not
entertaining,
but
that's
not
the
point.
to
some
it
may
well
be.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
is
this
any
different
than
what
we
said
we
don't
do
in
the
first
amendment
field
in
stevens,
where
we
said
we
don't
look
at
a
category
of
speech
and
decide
that
some
of
it
has
low
value?
we
decide
whether
a
category
of
speech
has
a
historical
tradition
of
being
regulated.
now,
other
than
some
state
statutes
that
you
point
to,
some
of
which
are
very
clearly
the
same
as
those
that
we
struck
down
in
wynn,
where
is
the
tradition
of
regulating
violence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
get
rid
of
rap
music?
have
you
heard
some
of
the
lyrics
of
some
of
the
rap
music,
some
of
the
original
violent
songs
that
have
been
sung
about
killing
people
and
about
other
violence
directed
to
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
the
state--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--why
isn't
that
obscene
in
the
sense
that
you
are
using
the
word,
or
deviant?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
earliest
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
earliest
statute
and
how
much
enforcement
was--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--can
i
have
a
point
of
clarification?
justice
ginsburg
talked
about
the
labeling
parts
of
this
act.
the
circuit
court
struck
those
portions
of
the
act.
you
have
not
challenged
that
ruling.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
are
two
sections
to
the
act.
one
is
a
criminal
act
for
selling
to
a
minor,
and
the
other
is
a
requirement
that
you
label
in
a
certain
way
each
video.
the
district
court
said
both
were
--
i
think
the
circuit
court
said
both
were
unconstitutional,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
your
brief
has
not
addressed
the
labeling
requirements
at
all.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
an
interesting
concession
on
your
part,
that
the
labeling
doesn't
have
a
need
separate
from
the
restriction
on
sale.
i
would
have
thought
that
if
you
wanted
a
lesser
restriction,
that
you
would
have
promoted
labeling
as
a
reasonable
strict
scrutiny
restriction
to
permit
the
control
of
sale
of
these
materials
to
minors;
but
you
seem
to
have
given
up
that
argument
altogether.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
have
conceded
it
by
not
appealing
it.
but
we're
not
--
your
case
on
labeling
rises
and
falls
on
the
sale
to
minors?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they
have
plenty
of
evidence
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
when
you
say--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
smith,
how
can
you
say
that?
there
is
plenty
of
proof
that
--
that
children
are
going
into
stores
and
buying
these
games
despite
the
voluntary
rating
system,
despite
the
voluntary
retailer
restraint
by
some.
there
is
still
proof
out
there
and
an
abundance
of
it
that
kids
are
buying
the
games.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
there
is
proof
that
some
parents,
as
well
intentioned
as
they
may
or
may
not
be,
have
not
been
able
to
supervise
that.
so
i
--
starting
from
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
problem,
it's
a
compelling
state
need,
why
are
you
arguing
that
there
is
no
solution
that
the
state
could
use
to
address
that
problem?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it's
still
about
20
percent
of
sales
are
going
to
kids.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
a
video
game
that
portrayed
a
vulcan
as
opposed
to
a
human
being,
being
maimed
and
tortured,
would
that
be
covered
by
the
act?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
the
video
producer
says
this
is
not
a
human
being,
it's
an
android
computer
simulated
person,
then
all
they
have
to
do
is
put
a
little
artificial
feature
on
the
creature
and
they
could
sell
the
video
game?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
happens
when
the
character
gets
maimed,
head
chopped
off
and
immediately
after
it
happens
they
spring
back
to
life
and
they
continue
their
battle.
is
that
covered
by
your
act?
because
they
haven't
been
maimed
and
killed
forever.
just
temporarily.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
that
feedback
to
justice
scalia's
question?
