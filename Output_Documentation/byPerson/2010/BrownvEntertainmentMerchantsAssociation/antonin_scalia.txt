what's
a
deviant
--
a
deviant,
violent
video
game?
as
opposed
to
what?
a
normal
violent
video
game?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
established
norms
of
violence?
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
the
grimm's
fairy
tales
are
quite
grim,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
okay?
are
you
going
to
ban
them,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
same
argument
could
have
been
made
when
movies
first
came
out.
they
could
have
said,
oh,
we've
had
violence
in
grimm's
fairy
tales,
but
we've
never
had
it
live
on
the
screen.
i
mean,
every
time
there's
a
new
technology,
you
can
make
that
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
an
average
minor
is
halfway
between
0
and
18;
is
that
9
years
old?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
concerned
about
the
jury
judging.
i'm
concerned
about
the
producer
of
the
games
who
has
to
know
what
he
has
to
do
in
order
to
comply
with
the
law.
and
you
are
telling
me,
well
a
jury
can
--
of
course
a
jury
can
make
up
its
mind,
i'm
sure.
but
a
law
that
has
criminal
penalties
has
to
be
clear.
and
how
is
the
manufacturer
to
know
whether
a
particular
violent
game
is
covered
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
he
convene
his
own
jury
and
try
it
before
--
you
know,
i
really
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
as
a
manufacturer.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
excessive
glorification
of
drinking,
movies
that
have
too
much
drinking?
does
it
have
an
effect
on
minors?
i
suppose
so.
i
--
i
am
not
just
concerned
with
the
vagueness.
i
am
concerned
with
the
vagueness,
but
i
am
concerned
with
the
first
amendment,
which
says
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech.
and
it
was
always
understood
that
the
freedom
of
speech
did
not
include
obscenity.
it
has
never
been
understood
that
the
freedom
of
speech
did
not
include
portrayals
of
violence.
you
are
asking
us
to
create
a
--
a
whole
new
prohibition
which
the
american
people
never
--
never
ratified
when
they
ratified
the
first
amendment.
they
knew
they
were
--
you
know,
obscenity
was
--
was
bad,
but
--
what's
next
after
violence?
drinking?
smoking?
movies
that
show
smoking
can't
be
shown
to
children?
does
--
will
that
affect
them?
of
course,
i
suppose
it
will.
but
is
--
is
that
--
are
--
are
we
to
sit
day
by
day
to
decide
what
else
will
be
made
an
exception
from
the
first
amendment?
why
--
why
is
this
particular
exception
okay,
but
the
other
ones
that
i
just
suggested
are
not
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
want
to
know
what
james
madison
thought
about
violence.
was
there
any
indication
that
anybody
thought,
when
the
first
amendment
was
adopted,
that
there
--
there
was
an
exception
to
it
for
--
for
speech
regarding
violence?
anybody?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
gather
that
--
that
if
--
if
the
parents
of
the
minor
want
the
kid
to
watch
this
violent
stuff,
they
like
gore,
they
may
even
like
violent
kids--
[laughter]
--then
--
then
the
state
of
california
has
no
objection?
right?
so
long
as
the
parent
buys
the
thing,
it's
perfectly
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
basically
all
this
is,
is
a
--
a
law
to
help
parents,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
should
consider
creating
such
a
one.
you
might
call
it
the
california
office
of
censorship.
it
would
judge
each
of
these
videos
one
by
one.
that
would
be
very
nice.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
let
the
government
do
that?
juries
are
not
controllable.
that's
the
wonderful
thing
about
juries,
also
the
worst
thing
about
juries.
[laughter]
but
--
but
do
we
let
government
pass
upon,
you
know,
a
board
of
censors?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
much
do
these
videos
cost?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
too
many
13-year-olds
walk
in
with
a
$50
bill,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
don't
want
to
argue
the
case
on
that
ground.
i
gather
you
don't
believe
that
the
first
amendment
reads,
"congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
except
those
that
make
sense.
"
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
doing
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
about
a
law
that
says
you
can't
sell
to
minors
a
video
game
--
it
doesn't
care
what
the
plot
is,
but
no
video
game
in
which
the
minor
commits
violent
acts
of
maiming,
killing,
setting
people
on
fire?
what
about
that?
would
that
--
would
that
be
regulating
speech?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
speech.
you
were
saying,
you
just
can't
let
the
kid
maim
--
maim,
kill,
or
set
on
fire.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
the
law
would
be
directed
at
is
not
the
plot,
not
the
video
game
itself,
but
the
child's
act
of
committing
murder,
maiming,
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
child
is
speaking
to
the
game?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
started
ginsberg
with
something
that
is
prescribable
even
with
regard
to
adults.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
--
as
obscenity,
which
can
be
proscribed
even
--
even
as
to
adults.
whereas
in
this
case,
i
don't
know
that
there's
such
a
thing
as
morbid
violence
which
could
be
eliminated
from
ordinary
movies.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
if
it
has
a
plot
it
has
artistic
value,
is
that
going
to
be
the
test
for
artistic
value?
anything
that
has
a
plot?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
factor
to
be
considered,
sure.
but
you
were
not
telling
us
that
so
long
as
it
has
a
plot
it's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
have
artistic
videos
that
involve
maiming
and
cutting
off
heads
and
eviscerating
people,
right,
so
long
as
its
artistic
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
artistic
for
whom,
for
a
5-year-old?
what
a
5-year-old
would
appreciate
as
great
art,
is
that
going
to
be
the
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
she's
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
2005,
california
enacted
assembly
bill
1179,
which
prohibits
the
sale
or
rental
of
violent
videogames
to
minors
and
requires
their
packaging
to
be
labeled
18.
the
act
covers
games,
"in
which
the
range
of
options
available
to
a
player
includes
killing,
maiming,
dismembering,
or
sexually
assaulting
an
image
of
a
human
being,
if
those
acts
are
depicted
in
a
manner
that
a
reasonable
person,
considering
the
game
as
a
whole,
would
find
appeals
to
a
deviant
or
morbid
interest
of
minors,
that
is
patently
offensive
to
prevailing
standards
in
the
community
as
to
what
is
suitable
for
minors,
and
that
causes
the
game
as
a
whole
to
lack
serious
literary,
artistic,
political,
or
scientific
value
for
minors."
violation
of
the
act
is
punishable
by
a
civil
fine
of
up
to
$1000.
respondents
representing
the
videogame
and
software
industries
brought
a
pre-enforcement
challenge
to
the
act
alleging
that
it
violates
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court
agreed
and
permanently
enjoined
its
enforcement.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari.
california
correctly
acknowledges
that
videogames
qualify
as
expression
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
like
books
plays
in
movies,
video
games
communicate
ideas.
the
most
basic
principle
of
first
amendment
law
is
that
government
has
no
power
to
restrict
expression
because
of
its
content.
there
are,
of
course,
exceptions.
from
1791
to
the
present,
the
first
amendment
has
permitted
restrictions
upon
the
content
of
this
--
of
speech
in
a
few
well-defined
and
narrowly
limited
areas,
such
as
obscenity,
incitement
and
fighting
words.
last
term
in
a
case
called
united
states
versus
stevens,
we
held
that
new
categories
of
unprotected
speech
may
not
be
added
to
that
list
by
a
legislature
that
conclude
certain
speeches
too
harmful
to
be
tolerated.
without
persuasive
evidence
that
a
novel
restriction
on
the
content
of
speech
is
part
of
a
long
tradition
of
proscription,
a
legislature
may
not
revise
the
judgement
of
the
american
people
embodied
in
the
first
amendment
that
the
benefits
of
constitutional
restrictions
on
the
government's
power
out
way
its
cause.
that
holding
controls
this
case.
california
statute
mimics
the
new
york
statute
that
we
upheld
in
a
case
called
ginsberg
versus
new
york.
that
statute
prohibited
the
sale
to
minors
of
sexual
material
that
did
not
meet
our
definition
of
obscenity
but
that
"appeals
to
the
prurient,
shameful
or
morbid
interests
of
minors,
is
patently
offensive
to
prevailing
standards
in
the
adult
community
as
a
whole
with
respect
to
what
is
suitable
for
minors
and
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance
for
minors."
we
held
that
new
york
court,
"adjust
the
definition
of
obscenity
to
social
realities
by
permitting
the
appeal
of
this
type
of
material
to
be
assessed
in
terms
of
the
sexual
interest
of
minors."
the
california
act,
however,
does
not
regulate
obscenity
for
children.
our
cases
make
clear
that
obscenity
covers
only
depictions
of
sexual
conduct
and
we
have
previously
rejected
attempt
to
shoehorn
violence
into
the
category
of
obscenity.
thus
this
law
does
not
adjust
the
boundaries
of
an
existing
category
of
unprotected
speech
to
ensure
that
a
definition
designed
for
adults
is
not
uncritically
applied
to
children,
instead,
it
purports
to
create
a
wholly
new
category
of
content
based
regulation
that
is
permissible
only
for
speech
directed
at
children
that
is
unprecedented
and
mistaken.
our
cases
hold
that
minors
are
entitled
to
a
significant
degree
of
first
amendment
protection.
the
government
has
no
free
floating
power
to
restrict
the
ideas
to
which
they
may
be
exposed.
there
is
no
tradition
in
this
country
of
especially
restricting
children's
access
to
depictions
of
violations.
certainly,
the
books
we
give
children
to
read
or
read
to
them
when
they
are
younger
have
no
shortage
of
gore.

in
truth,
the
california
act
is
the
latest
in
a
long
serious
of
failed
attempts
to
censor
violent
entertainment
for
minors
before
videogames
came
cheap
novels
depicting
crime,
they
were
penny
dreadfuls,
motion
pictures,
comic
books,
television
and
music
lyrics,
all
of
which
were
blamed
by
some
for
juvenile
delinquency.
one
prominent
psychiatrist,
who
crusaded
against
comic
books,
told
the
senate
judiciary
committee
that,
"as
long
as
the
crime
comic
books
industry
exists
in
its
present
form,
there
are
no
secure
homes."
his
objection
--
his
objection
extended
even
to
superman
comics,
which
he
described
as
"particularly
injurious
to
the
ethical
development
of
children."
he
did
not
convince
the
senate
but
he
did
convince
the
new
york
legislature
to
pass
a
ban
on
the
sale
of
certain
comic
books
to
minors.
it
was
vetoed
by
governor
thomas
dewey
on
the
ground
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
despite
this
censorship
campaigns,
this
court
has
never
permitted
government
regulation
of
minor's
access
to
any
forms
of
entertainment
except
on
obscenity
grounds.
the
consequence
is
that
california's
novel
content
based
restriction
on
speech
must
be
subjected
to
strict
scrutiny.
it
does
not
pass.
california
has
not
demonstrated
any
direct
causal
link
between
playing
violent
videogames
and
actual
harm
to
minors,
rather,
the
state
relies
on
a
number
of
studies
showing
at
best
some
correlation
between
exposure
to
violent
entertainment
and
minuscule
real-world
effects,
such
as
children's
feeling
more
aggressive
or
making
louder
noises
in
the
few
minutes
after
playing
a
violent
game.
those
effects
are
both
small
and
indistinguishable
from
the
observed
effects
produced
by
other
media.
in
his
testimony
in
a
similar
lawsuit,
the
state's
--
the
state's
expert
admitted
that
the
effect
sizes
of
children's
exposure
to
violent
videogames
are
“about
the
same”
as
that
produced
by
their
exposure
to
violence
on
television.
and
he
admits
that
the
same
effects
have
been
found
when
children
watch
cartoons
starring
bugs
bunny
or
the
road
runner
or
when
they
play
videogames
like
sonic
the
hedgehog
that
are
rated
e,
appropriate
for
all
ages,
or
even
when
they
"view
a
picture
of
a
gun."
of
course,
california
has
declined
to
restrict
saturday
morning
cartoons
which
means
that
its
regulation
is
wildly
under
inclusive
when
judged
against
its
asserted
justification,
which
in
our
view
is
enough
to
defeat
it,
and
the
act
is
under
inclusive
in
another
respect.
the
california
legislature
is
perfectly
willing
to
live
this
dangerous
mind
altering
material
in
the
hands
of
children
so
long
as
one
parent
or
even
an
aunt
or
an
uncle
says,
“it's
okay.”
that
is
not
how
one
addresses
a
serious
social
problem.
finally,
the
california
claims
that
the
act
is
justified
as
an
aid
to
parents
by
requiring
that
the
purchase
of
violent
videogames
can
be
made
only
by
adults.
california
says,
“the
act
ensures
that
parents
can
decide
what
games
are
appropriate.”
we
doubt
the
punishing
third
parties
for
conveying
protected
speech
to
children
just
in
case
their
parents
disapprove
of
that
speech,
is
a
proper
governmental
means
of
aiding
parental
authority.
but
in
any
case,
the
videogame
industry
has
in
place
a
voluntary
rating
system
designed
to
inform
consumers
and
store
owners
about
which
games
contained
a
high-degree
of
violence.
this
system
does
much
to
ensure
that
minors
cannot
purchase
seriously
violent
games
on
their
own
and
that
parents
who
care
about
the
matter
can
regularly
--
can
readily
evaluate
the
games
their
children
bring
home.
filling
the
remaining
modest
gap
in
concerned-parents'
control
can
hardly
be
a
compelling
state
interest.
moreover,
just
as
the
statute
fails
strict
scrutiny
because
it
is
under
inclusive
with
respect
to
the
harm
to
children
rationale,
it
fails
strict
scrutiny
because
it
is
over
inclusive
with
respect
to
the
aid
to
parents'
rationale.
not
all
the
children
who
are
forbidden
to
purchase
violent
videogames
on
their
own
have
parents
who
care
whether
they
purchase
violent
videogames.
while
some
of
the
legislations
effect
may
indeed
be
in
support
of
what
some
parents
of
the
restricted
children
actually
want,
its
entire
effect
is
only
in
support
of
what
the
state
thinks
parents
ought
to
want.
that
is
not
the
narrow
tailoring
to
assist
parents
that
restriction
of
first
amendment
rights
requires.
we
are
enclosing
that
we
do
not
demean
or
disparage
the
concerns
that
underlie
the
attempt
to
regulate
violent
videogames,
concerns
that
may
and
doubtless
do
prompt
a
good
deal
of
parental
oversight.
we
have
no
business
passing
judgment
on
the
view
of
the
california
legislature
or
anyone
else,
that
violent
videogames
corrupt
the
young
or
harm
their
moral
development.
our
task
is
only
to
say
whether
or
not
such
works
constitute
a
“well-defined
and
narrowly
limited
class
of
speech,
