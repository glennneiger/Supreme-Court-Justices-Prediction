mr.
paul
m.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
california
law
at
issue
restricts
the
distribution
of
expressive
works
based
on
their
content.
california,
as
we
have
heard
today,
does
not
seriously
contend
that
it
can
satisfy
the
usual
first
amendment
standards
that
apply
to
such
a
law.
instead
it's
asking
this
court
to
grant
it
a
new
free
pass,
a
brand-new
ginsberg-like
exception
to
the
first
amendment
that
would
deny
constitutional
protection
to
some
ill-defined
subset
of
expressive
works,
and
i
submit
not
just
video
games,
but
necessarily
movies,
books
and
any
other
expressive
work
that
describes
or
portrays
violence
in
a
way
that
some
court
somewhere,
some
day,
would
decide
is
deviant
and
offensive.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
your
honor,
it
might.
the
state
of
california
has
not
marshalled
a
shred
of
evidence
to
suggest
it's
true.
and
if
you
look
at
the
social
science--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
state
of
the
record
was
that
they
were
aware
of
science
on
both
sides
and
made
a
judgment
that
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
they
could
decide
that
obscenity,
even
somewhat
at-large
obscenity--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes.
it
said
as
long
as
there
is
science
on
both
sides,
but
in
that
particular
area,
which
is
an
exception
based
--
that
goes
back
to
the
founding,
they
felt
that
it
was
proper
for
them
to
adjust
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
exception.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
that's
certainly
true.
but
one
of
the
things
about
the
case
that
is
important
to
recognize,
is
they
didn't
pass
on
the
particular
material
before
the
court.
they
simply
said,
is
this
somewhat
larger
definition
of
variable
obscenity
going
to
be
acceptable
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
the
state
has
to
have
some
reason
to
think
that
parents--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--there
is
two
aspects
of
harm.
the
one
i
was
about
to
address
was
the
question
of
whether
parents
need
additional
help
in
exercising
the
role
that
they
have
played
throughout
the
history--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
two
aspects.
with
respect
to
parental
controls,
your
honor,
there
is
a
whole
variety
--
a
whole
series
of
things
that
parents
have
available
to
them
and
are
using
today
to
deal
with
any
concerns
they
have
about
what's
appropriate
for
their
children.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
that
is
one
element
of
about
five
different
elements,
your
honor.
if
i
could
talk
about
--
there
is
the
ratings.
parents
are
doing
the
purchasing
90
percent
of
the
time.
even
if
the
child
does
the
purchasing,
they
bring
the
game
home,
the
parent
can
review
it.
the
game
is
being
played
in
the
home
on
the
family
television
or
computer
most
of
the
time.
any
harm
that
is
supposed
to
be
inflicted
on
them
is
supposed
to
take
place
over
a
period
of
years,
not
minutes,
so
the
parent
has
ample
opportunity
to
exercise
parental
supervision
over
what
games
are
being
played
in
the
house.
plus
there
is
the
parental
controls,
which
are
similar
to
the
ones
that
the
court
has
found
to
be
significant
in
the
playboy
case,
in
the
copa
case,
a
whole
variety
of
cases.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
they
cost
in
the
range
of
$50
or
$60
when
new,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
it
seems
very
likely
that
the
people,
if
there
are
any
out
there
buying
games
without
parental
permission
--
which
the
state,
by
the
way,
has
not
even
tried
to
show
--
they
are
likely
in
the
16-year-old
category.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
there
is
various
aspects
of
this
that
i
think
it's
important
to
understand.
first
of
all,
violence
has
been
a
feature
of
works
that
we
create
for
children
and
encouraged
them
to
watch
throughout
the
history
of
this
country.
we
have
a
very
different
sense
of
whether
violence
per
se--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--there
is
a
huge
difference.
the
difference
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--we
do
not
--
the
difference
is
we
do
not
make
films
for
children
in
which
explicit
sex
happens.
we
do
make
films
for
children
in
which
graphic
violence
happens.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
and
parents
have
been
doing
that
since
time
immemorial.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
you
are
going
to
create
an
entirely
new
exception
under
the
first
amendment,
whether
parents
need
to
have
such
a
new
exception
created,
and
whether
or
not
if
you
are
going
to
do
it
you
could
possibly
figure
out
what
the
scope
of
that
exception
is.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
my
position
is
that
most
people
would
think
that
that's
an
inappropriate
game
for
minors.
we
do
not
try
to
sell
it
to
minors,
but
the
constitution
should
not
be--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--my
position--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--my
position
is
that
there
is
not
a
violence
exception
to
the
first
amendment
for
minors
and
there
should
not
be.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
and
the
reason
for
that
is
there
is
no
possible
way,
it's
an
insuperable
problem,
to
use
the
english
language
to
draw
an
exception
to
the
constitution,
to
the
first
amendment,
that
would--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--exercising
our
first
amendment
rights,
we
have
decided--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--what
that
would
do
is
transform
the
esrb,
the
private
voluntary
system
that
exists,
into
the
censorship
commission
that
this
court
struck
down
in
interstate
circuit.
when
the
government
does
that
and
you
have
to
go
to
them
for
permission
to
allow
kids
into
the
movies
or
to
play
this
game,
it
is
a
prior
restraint.
you
have
way
too
much
discretion.
it's
a
licensing
authority
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
allow.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
think
it's
important
to
draw
a
distinction
between
harm
that
could
be
cognizable
under
the
law
and
appropriateness.
families
have
different
judgments
that
they
make
about
their
children
at
different
ages
and
with
different
content
and
different
family
values.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
no,
they
don't.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
i
guess
i
can
imagine
a
world
in
which
expression
could
transform
75
percent
of
the
people
who
experience
it
into
murderers.
that's
clearly
not
the
way
the
human
mind
works.
here
the
reality
is
quite
the
opposite.
dr.
anderson
testified
in
the
illinois
trial,
which
is
in
the
record,
that
the
vast
majority
of
people
playing
the
games
will
grow
up
and
be
just
fine.
and
in
fact,
he
acknowledged
that
the
effects
of
these
games
are
not
one
whit
different
from
watching
cartoons
on
television
or
reading
violent
passages
in
the
bible
or
looking
at
a
picture
of
a
gun.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
my
main
ground
today
is
exactly
that,
that
this
court
said
last
year
in
united
states
v.
stevens
it
doesn't
have
a
freewheeling
authority
to
create
new
exceptions
to
the
first
amendment
after
200
years
based
on
a
cost-benefit
analysis,
and
this
is
a
test
of
that.
this
is
ex
actly
what
the
state
of
california
is
asking
you
to
do.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
we
do
have
a
new
medium
here,
your
honor,
but
we
have
a
history
in
this
country
of
new
mediums
coming
along
and
people
vastly
overreacting
to
them,
thinking
the
sky
is
falling,
our
children
are
all
going
to
be
turned
into
criminals.
it
started
with
the
crime
novels
of
the
late
19th
century,
which
produced
this
raft
of
legislation
which
was
never
enforced.
it
started
with
comic
books
and
movies
in
the
1950s.
there
were
hearings
across
the
street
in
the
1950s
where
social
scientists
came
in
and
intoned
to
the
senate
that
half
the
juvenile
delinquency
in
this
country
was
being
caused
by
reading
comic
books,
and
there
was
enormous
pressure
on
the
industry.
they
self
--
they
self-censored.
we
had
television.
we
have
rock
lyrics.
we
have
the
internet.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
the
games
that
we
are
talking
about
have
narrative,
events
that
are
occurring,
characters,
and
plot.
that
is
exactly
what
the
state
has
set
out
to
regulate
here.
it
says
if
these
events
occur
here
--
there
is
violence,
one
person
is
hurting
another
person
--
it
has
to
be
a
human
being
who
is
the
victim
--
and
is
doing
it
in
a
way
that
they
find
offensive
in
some
way,
we
are
going
to
regulate
it.
so
obviously--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--you
don't
have
to,
as
long
as
the
law
is
limited
to
regulating
narrative.
that's
what
this
law
is
limited
to.
now,
if
the
law
said
you
shouldn't
buy
--
play
games
that
have
red
images
that
appear
in
them,
or
something
else
that
was
somehow
non-content
based,
that
might
be
a
closer
case.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
of
course,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
what
--
what--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
the
events
in
a
video
game
--
what
happens
in
the
plot
is
a
combination
of
what
the
game
gives
you
and
what
the
player
adds
to
it.
there
is
a
creative
aspect
coming
at
it
from
the
other
side.
it's
often
referred
to
as
a
dialogue
between
the
player
and
the
game.
i
would
submit
that
both
are
completely
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
just
as
a
person--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--no.
the
child
is
helping
to
make
the
plot,
determine
what
happens
in
the
events
that
appear
on
the
screen,
just
as
an
actor
helps
to
portray
what
happens
in
a
play.
you
are
acting
out
certain
elements
of
the
play
and
you
are
contributing
to
the
events
that
occur
and
adding
a
creative
element
of
your
own.
that's
what
makes
them
different
and
in
many
ways
wonderful.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
very
clear
under
the
law
of
this
court
that
those
tests
don't
apply
in
a
first
amendment
context
if
the--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it's
--
there
is
no
argument
here,
i
don't
think,
that
if
you
can
find
one
game
out
there
to
which
this
can
constitutionally
be
applied,
even
though
it
would
also
be
unconstitutionally
applied
with
the
vast
amount
of
other
cases--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
that
may
be--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--you
certainly
could
do
that.
certainly,
the
key
thing
is
if
you
strike
down
this
law,
because
this
law
is
clearly
much
broader
than
any
one
game,
i
would
submit
to
you,
though,
that
there
is
no
way
that,
in
fact,
anybody
is
going
to
be
able
to
come
back
and
draw
a
statute
that
gets
to
what
they
claim,
because
the
english
language
is
not
susceptible
at
that
level
of
precision.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
your
honor,
they
do
not
suggest
that
there
is
any
existing
exception
to
the
first
amendment
that
would
apply
to--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
they
make
a
feint
at
trying
to
argue--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--there
you
go,
okay.
your
honor,
i
think
if
you
apply
strict
scrutiny
here
they
do
not
come
close
to
the
kind
of
showing
that
would
be
required
under
--
under
the
first
amendment.
first
of
all,
they
have
not
shown
any
problem,
let
alone
a
compelling
problem,
requiring
regulation
here
in
a
world
where
parents
are
fully
empowered
already
to
make
these
calls,
where
crime,
including
violent
crimes,
since
the
introduction
of
these
games
has
been
plummeting
in
this
country,
down
50
percent
since
the
day
doom
first
went
on
the
market
15
years
ago;
in
a
world
where
parents
are
fully
aware
of
what's
going
on
in
their
homes
and
aware
of
the
ratings
system
and
can
use
all
the
other
tools
that
we
have
talked
about--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
because
obscenity
doesn't
have
strict
scrutiny
applied
to
it.
if
it
did,
i
expect
you
could
make
the
same
arguments,
if
there--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
because
first
of
all
we
don't
have
the
same
history
of
it.
there
is
no
historical
pedigree
of
that
kind
of
an
exception.
and
as
i
was
suggesting
earlier,
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
factually,
which
is
ginsberg
works
tolerably
well
because
we
take
everything
that's
sexually
explicit
and
appeals
to
a
prurient
interest
and
we
say
over
here,
it
is
not
appropriate
for
minors.
violence
would
require
you
to
draw
a
much
different
line
between
acceptable
protected
violence
and
unacceptable
unprotected
violence
for
minors,
and
given
the
lack
of
historical
pedigree
but
also
just
given
the
nature
of
what
you
are
trying
to
do--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--and
if
you
take
the
miller
standards
and
you
take
two
thing
out
of
it,
you
take
out
of
it
explicit
sex
and
nudity,
and
you
take
out
an
appeal
to
prurient
interest,
what
do
you
have
left?
you
have
left
--
what
you
have
is
a
structure
with
no
apparent
meaning.
there
is
no
way
to
know
how
a
court
would
apply
a
standard
like
deviant
violence,
morbid
violence,
offensive
violence,
let
alone
decide
which
video
games
have
a
redeeming
social,
political.
artistic
value.
the
value
of
a
video
game
is
completely
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder.
some
would
say
they
are
beautiful
works
of
artistic
creation;
others
would
say--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--except
that
you
know
--
we
know,
we
all
know
at
least
with
respect
to
ginsberg
--
adult
obscenity
i
would
acknowledge
is
a
very
difficult
line.
adult
--
ginsberg
works
reasonably
well,
because
if
it
has
sex
in
it
and
naked
people
having
sex
in
it
and
it's
designed
to
be
appealing
to
people's
prurient
interests,
you
don't
give
it
to
minors
and
you
don't
have
a
lot
of
cases
out
there
about
that.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
let
me
--
i
think
a
little
history
is
in
order
here.
this
court
has
twice
dealt
with
laws
attempting
to
regulated
violent
works
in
the
past.
one
was
in
winters
v.
new
york
where
law
applied
to
magazines
and
books,
and
one
was
in
the
1960s.
on
the
very
day
ginsberg
came
down
in
the
interstate
circuit
case,
the
city
of
dallas
had
an
ordinance
where
there
was
going
to
be
a
commission
that
was
going
to
review
each
movie
and
decide
if
it
was
appropriate
for
children.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
my
position
is--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--my
position
is
that
strict
scrutiny
applies,
and
that
given
the
facts
in
the
record,
given
the
fact
that
the
--
the
problem
is
already
well
controlled,
the
parents
are
empowered,
and
there
are
great
and
less
alternatives
out
there--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--there
isn't
any
basis
to
say
scrutiny
is
satisfied.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
because
there
is
no
problem
it
needs
to
solve
that
would
justify--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
answer
is
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
just--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--the
--
the
existing
solutions
are
perfectly
capable
of
allowing
this
problem
to
be
addressed,
assuming
it
is
a
problem.
and
i--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--that's
when
they
send
in
somebody
who's
16
to
test
the
system.
there
isn't
any
evidence
at
all
in
this
record
that
actual
children,
not
testers,
are
in
fact
disobeying
their
parents
and
secretly
buying
these
games,
bringing
them
into
the
home
and
playing
them
for
years
without
their
parents
unaware
of
it.
there
is
simply
no
evidence
of
that
at
all.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
if
what
you
are
saying
is
you
are
going
to
have
a
limit
on
the
ability
of
minors
to
buy
them
because
of
walled
off,
and
minors
are
not
allowed
to
go
pick
them
off
the
shelf--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--then
i
don't
know
how
that
differs
from
the
current
law,
your
honor,
assuming
you
could
figure
out--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--yes.
strict
scrutiny
does
not
make
sense.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
would
think
that
that's
probably
not--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--except
that
cigarettes
are
not
speech,
your
honor.
this
is
fully
protected
speech.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
well,
truly
the
record
doesn't
support
it.
the
record
says
that
if
--
even
if
you
take
the
studies
at
face
value,
it
is
not
one
more
whit
less
more
harmful
than
watching
television
cartoons.
that's
what
the
record
shows.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
what
they
did
was
they
spent
several
years
trying
to
come
up
with
a
definition
that
would
allow
anybody
to
figure
out
which
violent
tv
shows
have
to
be
put
into
this
violent
adult
category
and
which
don't,
and
they
eventually
punted
and
said,
we
have
no
idea
to
do
that;
congress
asked
us
to
do
it;
we
cannot
do
it;
and
they
punted
it
back
to
congress
to
try
to
come
up
with
a
definition.
this
is
a
very
difficult
task,
trying
to
use
language
to
differentiate
levels
of
violence
or
types
of
violence
in
a
manner
that
would
in
some
way
tell
people
what
the
rules
of
the
game
are.
i
think
even
if
you
think
that
there
is
some
problem
out
there
that
needs
to
be
solved,
you
ought
to
think
very
carefully
about
whether
or
not
you
are
going
to
authorize
some
creation
of
a
new
rule
authorizing
regulation
in
this
area,
when
nobody
will
have
any
idea
what
the
scope
of
it
is.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
i
guess
if
what
we
are
really
going
to
do
is
judge
the
constitution
of
this
law
based
on
what
16
and
17-year-olds
are
getting
and
whether
that
would
be
harmful
to
them,
i
think
the
problem
there
is
the
line
between
16
and
17
and
18
is
so
fine,
that
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
identify
any
real
category
of
games
that
fits
into
that
category.
and
it's
important
by
the
way
to
note
that
california
hasn't
told
us
whether
we
should
judge
5-year-olds,
10-year-olds,
17-year-olds.
if
it's
5-year-olds,
it's
vastly
overrestrictive;
if
it's
17-year-olds
i
suspect
--
i
suspect
it
wouldn't
restrict
anything
because
nobody
is
going
to
be
able
to
convince
a
--
jury,
well,
this
is
an
18-year-old
game,
not
a
17-year-old
game.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
you
do
draw
that
line,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
smith
but
here
you
were
assessing
works
of
expression,
deciding
to
decide
what
age
they
--
they
would
correspond
to,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
cut
it
that
finely
and
say
well,
this
is
an
18
game;
this
is
only
a
17
game.
i
just
don't
think
that
works.
so
if
that's
the
test,
the
test
justice
breyer
suggested
it
ought
to
be,
then
the
statute
essentially
would
restrict
nothing.
if
the
test
is
5-year-olds--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--well,
first
of
all--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--i
think
the
maybe
is
telling,
though,
your
honor.
somebody,
as
justice
scalia
would
point
out,
in
publishing
a
game
has
to
know
what
--
what
--
what
the
rules
of
the
game
are
in
advance.
subject
to
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
penalties,
this
is
$1,000
a
game
penalty.
if--
mr.
paul
m.
smith
--our
rules
wouldn't
help
you
at
all.
they
say
that
they
are
only
restricting
a
smaller
number,
a
small
subset
of
m-rated
games,
which
by
the
way,
we
say
are
appropriate
for
17-year-olds.
so
these
ratings
that
the
state
wants
us
to
impose
are
going
to
conflict
with
the
ratings
that
are
already
on
the
packaging
which
are
being
used
by
parents
every
day
to
make
these
judgments.
so
it's
actually
interfering.
the
prospect
of
it
would
interfere
with
the
information
already
on
the
packaging.
