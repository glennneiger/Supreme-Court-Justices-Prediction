what's
the
difference?
i
mean,
if
you
are
supposing
a
category
of
violent
materials
dangerous
to
children,
then
how
do
you
cut
it
off
at
video
games?
what
about
films?
what
about
comic
books?
grimm's
fairy
tales?
why
are
video
games
special?
or
does
your
principle
extend
to
all
deviant,
violent
material
in
whatever
form?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
california
doesn't
do
that.
california
has
in
big
letters
18>
["].
so
it's
not
is
it
okay
for
a
7-year-old,
is
it
okay
for
a
12-year-old.
part
of
this
statute
requires
labeling
these
video
games
in
big
numbers
18>
["].
so
it's
18
and
california
doesn't
make
any
distinctions
between
17-year-olds
and
4-year-olds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
i
go
back
to
what
justice
breyer
was
asking?
because
this
court,
with
respect
to
the
fighting
words,
chaplinsky's
"in
your
face",
provoked
an
immediate
action,
the
court
has
been
very
careful
to
cordon
that
off
so
it
doesn't
have
this
spillover
potential.
so
you
--
you
didn't
latch
on
to
fighting
words.
your
analogy
is
to
obscenity
for
teenagers,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--california
has
a
ginsberg
type
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
--
you've
been
asked
questions
about
the
vagueness
of
this
and
the
problem
for
the
seller
to
know
what's
good
and
what's
bad.
california
--
does
california
have
any
kind
of
an
advisory
opinion,
an
office
that
will
view
these
videos
and
say,
yes,
this
belongs
in
this,
what
did
you
call
it,
deviant
violence,
and
this
one
is
just
violent
but
not
deviant?
is
there
--
is
there
any
kind
of
opinion
that
the
--
that
the
seller
can
get
to
know
which
games
can
be
sold
to
minors
and
which
ones
can't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
material
wasn't
obscene.
they
were
girlie
magazines,
i
imagine
to
today's
children
they
would
seem
rather
tame,
the
magazines
involved.
but
they
were
definitely
not
obscene
with
respect
to
adults.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
on
that
--
on
that
score,
mr.
smith,
there
is
a
study
by
the
fcc.
the
question
is
whether
violence
can
be
restricted
during
the
hours
when
most
children
are
awake,
just
the
way
pornography
is.
i
don't
remember
what
--
what
are
the
hours,
that
--
something
like
from
10:00
in
the
evening?
i
don't
--
but
didn't
the
fcc
say,
yes,
we
could
do
the
same
thing
for
violence
that
we
are
doing
for
sex,
except
we
don't
think
we
ought
to
do
it,
we
think
congress
should
do
it?
