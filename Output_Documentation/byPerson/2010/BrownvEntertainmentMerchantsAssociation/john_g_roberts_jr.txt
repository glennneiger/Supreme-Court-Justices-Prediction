chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-1448,
schwarzenegger
v.
entertainment
merchants
association.
mr.
morazzini.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that
misses
justice
ginsburg's
question,
which
is:
why
just
video
games?
why
not
movies,
for
example,
as
well?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
morazzini.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
distinction
between
books
and
movies
may
be
that
in
these
video
games
the
child
is
not
sitting
there
passively
watching
something;
the
child
is
doing
the
killing.
the
child
is
doing
the
maiming.
and
i
suppose
that
might
be
understood
to
have
a
different
impact
on
the
child's
moral
development.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
was
the
state
of
the
record
that
was
present
before
the
court
in
ginsberg?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
court
acted
on
the
basis
of
common
sense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
answer,
but
any
13-year-old
can
bypass
parental
controls
in
about
5
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
graphic
violence.
there
is
a
difference.
we
do
not
have
a
tradition
in
this
country
of
telling
children
they
should
watch
people
actively
hitting
schoolgirls
over
the
head
with
a
shovel
so
they'll
beg
with
mercy,
being
merciless
and
decapitating
them,
shooting
people
in
the
leg
so
they
fall
down.
i'm
reading
from
the
district
court
description:
pour
gasoline
over
them,
set
them
on
fire
and
urinate
on
them.
we
do
not
have
a
tradition
in
this
country.
we
protect
children
from
that.
we
don't
actively
expose
them
to
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
your
position
--
i
know
this
is
a
facial
challenge,
mr.
smith.
so
is
it
your
position
that
the
first
amendment
could
not
prohibit
the
sale
to
minors
of
the
video
game
that
i
just
described?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
you
don't,
but
what
is
--
you
are
avoiding
the
answer.
does
the
first
amendment
protect
the
sale
of
that
video
to
minors?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
minor?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
position
is
that
the
first
amendment
does
not,
cannot,
no
matter
what
type
of
law,
whether
this
one
is
vague
or
not,
that
the
state
legislature
cannot
pass
a
law
that
says
you
may
not
sell
to
a
10-year-old
a
video
in
which
they
set
schoolgirls
on
fire.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
smith,
your
challenge
is
a
facial
challenge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
under
--
whether
you
use
the
salerno
test
or
the
glucksberg
test,
if
there
is
either
one
or
any
applications
that
would
satisfy
the
constitution,
the
facial
challenge
fails.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
we
referenced
them
last
year
in
the
stevens
case,
and
the
only
reason
we
didn't
have
to
decide
which
applies
is
because
we
adopted
an
approach
that
looked
at
overbreadth
and
said
this
statute
is
overbroad,
and
specifically
didn't
decide
whether
it
could
be
applied
in
that
case
to
crush
videos.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
understood
--
the
tenor
of
much
of
the
questioning,
i
think,
is
that
there
may
be
games
and
may
be
minors
--
maybe
a
less
violent
game
sold
to
a
17-year-old,
perhaps
that
violates
the
first
amendment,
but
something
like
postal
2
sold
to
a
10-year-old
might
well
--
might
well
not
violate
the
first
amendment
to
apply
this
law
to
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
way
we
approached
the
issue
in
stevens,
where
we
had
hunting
videos
and
crush
videos,
would
say
that
it's
too
broad
to
apply
the
law
to
everything,
so
we
strike
it
down,
it's
overbroad,
but
leave
open
the
possibility
that
a
more
narrowly-drawn
statute
might
pass
muster.
why
isn't
that
a
good
approach
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
just
to
be
clear,
your
answer
to
justice
alito
is
at
this
point
there
is
nothing
the
state
can
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i
just
have
a
simple
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
nothing
the
state
can
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
have
a
law
that
says
the
state
has
to
put
--
the
dealers
have
to
put
the
violent
video
games
in
a
particular
area
of
the
video
store?
that
is
not
--
and
then
--
you
know,
and
minors
are
not
allowed
in
that
area?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
they
can't
say,
example,
all
the
--
all
the
highest
rated
videos
have
to
be
on
the
top
shelf
out
of
the
reach
of
children.
can
they
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
they
do
with
cigarettes
or
something,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
that
cigarettes
are
not
speech,
mr.
smith.
cigarettes
are
something
that
we
have
determined
are
harmful
to
children.
the
question
is,
you
say
the
record
doesn't
support
the
idea
that
these
video
games
are
harmful
to
children.
some
of
us
may
conclude
that
it
does.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
draw
that
kind
of
line
of
course
in
the
death
penalty
area,
don't
we?
between
18-year-olds?
you
are
under
18;
you
can't
be
sentenced
to
life
without
parole;
if
you
were
over
18
you
can.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
we
do
it
for
drinking;
we
do
it
for
driving.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
morazzini,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
