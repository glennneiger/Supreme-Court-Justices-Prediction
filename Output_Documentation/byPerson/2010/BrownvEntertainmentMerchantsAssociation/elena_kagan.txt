justice
elena
kagan
well,
do
you
actually
have
studies
that
show
that
video
games
are
more
harmful
to
minors
than
movies
are?
justice
elena
kagan
suppose
a
new
study
suggested
that
movies
were
just
as
violent.
then,
presumably,
california
could
regulate
movies
just
as
it
could
regulate
video
games?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
morazzini,
could
i
take
you
back
to
justice
scalia's
original
question,
which
was
what
counts
as
deviant
violence
or
morbid
violence.
because
i
read
your
briefs
all
the
way
through
and
the
only
thing
that
i
found
you
said
that
was
clearly
covered
by
this
statute
was
postal
2.
but
presumably
the
statute
applies
to
more
than
one
video
game.
so
what
else
does
it
apply
to?
how
many
video
games?
what
kind
of
video
games?
i
mean,
how
would
you
describe
in
plain
english
what
morbid
violence
is,
what
you
have
to
see
in
a
video
game
for
it
to
be
covered?
justice
elena
kagan
so
anything
that
has
those
kinds
of
violence
counts?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
so
how
do
we
separate
violent
games
that
are
covered
from
violent
games
just
as
violent
that
are
not
covered?
justice
elena
kagan
so
is
what
is
covered
here
the
mature
category
in
the
ratings?
is
that
what
this
statute
covers?
is
that
what
it's
meant
to
cover?
justice
elena
kagan
some
but
not
all.
justice
elena
kagan
so
could
i
just
make
--
make
sure
i
understand
that,
mr.
morazzini,
because
as
i
understand
the
state
has
given
up
its
argument
that
the
interest
protected
by
this
law
is
an
interest
in
preventing
minors
who
see
these
games
from
going
out
and
committing
violent
acts
themselves;
that
the
state
is
not
saying
that
that's
the
interest
in
the
law;
is
that
correct?
that
instead
the
state
is
saying
that
the
interest
in
the
law
is
in
protecting
children's
moral
development
generally?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
smith,
is
there
any
showing
that
the
states
could
make
that
would
satisfy
you,
that
would
say
yes,
that's
a
sufficient
showing
for
this
law
to
go
forward?
you
know,
i
understand
that
you
think
that
the
current
studies
don't
suggest
much
of
anything
about
harm.
justice
elena
kagan
but
are
there
studies
that
would
be
enough?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
smith,
do
you
think
all
video
games
are
speech
in
the
first
instance?
because
you
could
look
at
these
games
and
say
they're
the
modern-day
equivalent
of
monopoly
sets.
they
are
games.
they
are
things
that
people
use
to
compete.
you
know,
when
you
think
about
some
of
them
--
the
first
video
game
was
pong.
it
was
playing
tennis
on
your
tv.
how
is
that
speech
at
all?
justice
elena
kagan
so
are
we
going
to
separate
video
games
into
narrative
video
games
and
non-narrative
video
games?
justice
elena
kagan
you
think
mortal
combat
is
prohibited
by
this
statute?
justice
elena
kagan
it's
a
candidate,
meaning,
yes,
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
that
mortal
combat,
which
is
an
iconic
game,
which
i
am
sure
half
of
the
clerks
who
work
for
us
spend
considerable
amounts
of
time
in
their
adolescence
playing.
