justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
just
make
one
comment
on
that
point.
it
seems
to
me
all
or
at
least
the
great
majority
of
the
questions
today
are
designed
to
probe
whether
or
not
this
statute
is
vague.
and
you
say
the
beauty
of
the
statute
is
that
it
utilizes
the
categories
that
have
been
used
in
the
obscenity
area,
and
that
there's
an
obvious
parallel
there.
the
problem
is,
is
that
for
generations
there
has
been
a
societal
consensus
about
sexual
material.
sex
and
violence
have
both
been
around
a
long
time,
but
there
is
a
societal
consensus
about
what's
offensive
for
sexual
material
and
there
are
judicial
discussions
on
it.
now,
those
judicial
discussions
are
not
precise.
you
could
have
had
the
same
questions
today
with
reference
to
an
obscenity
statute,
and
we
have
--
we
have
said
that,
with
reference
to
obscenity
there
are
certain
--
that
there
are
certain
materials
that
are
not
protected.
those
rules
are
not
precise
at
the
margins
and
some
would
say
not
precise
in
a
more
significant
degree
as
well.
but
you
are
asking
us
to
go
into
an
entirely
new
area
where
there
is
no
consensus,
no
judicial
opinions.
and
this
is
--
and
this
indicates
to
me
the
statute
might
be
vague,
and
i
just
thought
you
would
like
to
know
that
--
that
reaction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
can
see
your
white
light
is
on.
but
even
if
we
get
past
what
i
think
are
difficult
questions
about
vagueness
and
how
to
interpret
this
law,
isn't
there
a
less
restrictive
alternative
with
the
--
the
v-chip?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
v-chips
don't
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
couldn't
you
make
the
same
arguments
with
respect
to
the
obscenity
statutes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
shouldn't
violence
be
treated
the
same
as
obscenity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
court
--
the
court
struggled
for
many,
many
years
and
to
some
extent
is
still
struggling
with
obscenity.
they
came
up
with
basically
what
we
might
call
the
miller
standards,
and
--
and
the
state
has
said
this
gives
us
a
category
that
we
can
work
with,
with
reference
to
violence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can
make
all
those
arguments
with
reference
to
obscenity.
