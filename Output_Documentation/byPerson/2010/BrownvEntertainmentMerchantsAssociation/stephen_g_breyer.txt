justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
wouldn't
you,
if
necessary,
simply
say
that
a
video
game
that
appeals
to
the
prurient,
shameful,
or
morbid
interests
of
those
18
--
or
under,
but
let's
take
18
--
and
it's
not
suitable
in
the
community
for
those
18,
and
it
has
no
redeeming
importance
of
any
kind,
no
serious
literary,
artistic,
political,
or
scientific
value
for
those
18,
that
at
least
as
to
those,
you
can't
sell
it
without
--
the
parent
can
buy
it
but
the
child
can't
buy
it.
so
you
can't
sell
to
a
12-year-old
something
that
would
be
horrible
for
an
18-year-old.
is
that
--
would
you
be
willing
to
accept
that
if
necessary
to
make
this
okay
on
its
face?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
on
the
principle,
i
mean,
it's
been
quite
some
years,
hasn't
it,
before
this
--
since
this
court
has
held
that
one
instance
that
courts
--
that
the
country,
legislatures,
can
regulate
are
fighting
words?
and
we
regulate
fighting
words,
don't
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
they
provoke
violence.
and
the
american
psychological
association
and
the
american
pediatric
association
have
said
that
certain
kinds
of
video
games
here
create
violence
when
children
are
exposed.
there
are
80
people
who
think
to
the
contrary,
there
are
two
huge
things
of
metastudies
that
think
that
--
not
to
the
contrary.
all
right.
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
talking
about
common
sense,
why
isn't
it
common
sense
to
say
that
if
a
parent
wants
his
13-year-old
child
to
have
a
game
where
the
child
is
going
to
sit
there
and
imagine
he
is
a
torturer
and
impose
gratuitous,
painful,
excruciating,
torturing
violence
upon
small
children
and
women
and
do
this
for
an
hour
or
so,
and
there
is
no
social
or
redeeming
value,
it's
not
artistic,
it's
not
literary,
et
cetera,
why
isn't
it
common
sense
to
say
a
state
has
the
right
to
say,
parent,
if
you
want
that
for
your
13-year-old,
you
go
buy
it
yourself,
which
i
think
is
what
they
are
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does,
it
does.
what
it
has
is
--
and
i
have
looked
at
the
studies,
perhaps
not
as
thoroughly
as
you.
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
dr.
ferguson
and
dr.
anderson
are
in
a
disagreement.
they
aren't
in
that
much
of
a
disagreement
actually,
but
they
have
looked
in
depth
at
a
whole
lot
of
video
games,
not
movies
they
are
talking
about
or
other
things;
they
are
talking
about
video
games.
and
both
groups
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
some
tendency
to
increase
violence.
and
the
american
psychiatric
--
psychological
association,
the
american
pediatric
association,
sign
on
to
a
long
list
on
i
think
it
is
the
anderson
side
that
this
does
hurt
children.
i
have
to
admit
that
if
i'm
supposed
to
be
a
sociological
expert,
i
can't
choose
between
them.
if
i
can
say
could
a
legislature
have
enough
evidence
to
think
there
is
harm,
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
they
need
additional
help
because
many
parents
are
not
home
when
their
children
come
home
from
school.
many
parents
have
jobs,
we
hope.
and
when
their
children
are
there,
they
do
what
they
want.
and
all
this
says
is
that
if
you
want
that
gratuitous
torture
of,
let's
say
babies,
to
make
it
as
bad
as
possible,
what
you
do,
parent,
is
you
go
buy
it;
don't
let
him
buy
it
on
his
own,
and
he's
13
years
old.
now,
what's
the
common
sense
or
what's
the
science
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
away
from
the
common
sense.
if
you
are
going
back
to
the
common
sense
of
it,
what
common
sense
is
there
in
having
a
state
of
the
law
that
a
state
can
forbid
and
says
to
the
parent
that
the
child,
the
13-year-old,
cannot
go
in
and
buy
a
picture
of
a
naked
woman,
but
the
13-year-old
child
can
go
in
and
buy
one
of
these
video
games
as
i
have
described?
i
have
tried
to
take
as
bad
a
one
as
i
could
think
of,
gratuitous
torture
of
children.
okay.
now,
you
can't
buy
a
naked
woman,
but
you
can
go
and
buy
that,
you
say
to
the
13-year-old.
now,
what
sense
is
there
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
love
is
not
something
that
people
have
tried
to
encourage
children
to
understand
and
know
about?
i
mean,
what's
the
difference
between
sex
and
violence?
both,
if
anything--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--thank
you.
i
understand
that.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
susceptible.
throughout
you
have
been
arguing
your
point,
which
is
fair.
you
have
some
experts
who
favor
you
and
you
make
that
point
very
strongly,
and
your
point's
a
pretty
good
one
and
a
serious
one,
that
it's
very
hard
to
draw
this
line
under
traditional
first
amendment
standards.
but
i
would
like
you
to
deal
with
their
point
for
a
moment.
and
i
take
it
their
point
is:
there
is
no
new
first
amendment
thing
here.
there
is
a
category
--
call
them
x
--
which
really
are
involving
things
like
torturing
children,
et
cetera.
maybe
you
don't
like
to
sell
them
to
anybody.
you
have
an
x
or
some
special
thing.
but
they
exist,
and
they
fit
within
a
miller-type
definition.
they
are
much
worse
than
the
simple
girlie
magazine
that
was
involved
there,
and
they
will
use
traditional
first
amendment
tests.
that
is
to
say,
there
is
speech
at
issue,
that
speech
is
being
limited,
it
is
being
done
for
a
good
reason,
compelling
interest
--
namely,
this
problem
with
the
x
videos
and
the
torture
and
living
it
through
--
and
there
is
no
less
restrictive
alternative
that
isn't
also
significantly
less
effective.
see,
i
want
you
to
deal
with
that
directly,
because
what
you
have
been
doing
for
the
most
part
is
saying
we
would
have
to
be
in
some
new,
total
new
area,
et
cetera.
but
their
argument
is
you
don't
have
to
be
in
some
totally
new
area,
et
cetera;
apply
traditional
first
amendment
standards
and
we
win.
that's
their
argument
and
i
would
like
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
that,
specifically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
not
an
exception.
it
is
the
traditional
strict
scrutiny
first
amendment
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
--
to
get
you
to
focus
on
it,
i'll
say
i've
made
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
--
your
answer
to
the
first
question
of
justice
alito
and
the
chief
justice
was
yes,
isn't
that
--
that
you
are
saying
that
there
is
nothing
they
can
do?
so
now,
am
i
right
about
that
or
am
i
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
right.
okay.
all
i
wanted
was
an
answer
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
stick
to
the
x
things,
maybe.
maybe
it
would
restrict
the
total
gratuitous
torture.
and
if
that's
what
it
restricted,
why
is
that
such
a
terrible
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
as
you
experimented
with
other
things,
as
they
did
in
the
obscenity
area,
you
could
discover
you
could
limit
it
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
have
your
rule,
so
why
wouldn't
the
first
step
be
they
would
follow
your
rules?
your
rules.
the
x
things
would
be
limited
to
people
who
are
over
18,
and
let's
see
if
we
ever
get
prosecuted
for
a
different
one.
and
you
might
never.
