justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
you
talk
about
minors,
what
are
you
--
what
age
group
are
you
talking
about?
if
a
video
game
manufacturer
has
to
decide
under
your
statute
how
to
--
where
its
game
stands,
what
age
of
a
child
should
the
manufacturer
have
in
mind?
a
17-year-old?
a
10-year-old?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
can
they
--
how
can
they
do
that?
isn't
the
average
person
likely
to
think
that
what's
appropriate
for
a
17-year-old
may
not
be
appropriate
for
a
10-year-old
or
an
8-year-old?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
think
what
justice
scalia
wants
to
know
is
what
james
madison
thought
about
video
games.
[laughter]
did
he
enjoy
them?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
there
is
any
barrier
in
california
to
minors'
access
to
sexual
material?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
your
office
spend
a
lot
of
time
enforcing
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
state
passed
a
--
what
if
california
took
the
list
of
video
games
that
your
association
rates
as
mature
and
said
there's
a
civil
penalty.
and
you
apparently
don't
want
your
--
you
don't
want
vendors
selling
those
games
to
minors,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
want
that.
and
what
if
california
said
there
is
a
civil
penalty
attached
to
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
seem
to
argue
that
there
really
is
no
good
reason
to
think
that
exposure
to
video
games
is
bad
for
minors,
exposure
to
really
violent
video
games
is
bad
to
minors;
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
we
have
here
a
new
--
a
new
medium
that
cannot
possibly
have
been
envisioned
at
the
time
when
the
first
amendment
was
ratified.
it
is
totally
different
from
--
it's
one
thing
to
read
a
description
of
--
as
one
of
--
one
of
these
video
games
is
promoted
as
saying,
"what's
black
and
white
and
red
all
over?
"
"perhaps
the
answer
could
include
disposing
of
your
enemies
in
a
meat
grinder.
"
now,
reading
that
is
one
thing.
seeing
it
as
graphically
portrayed--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
doing
it
is
still
a
third
thing.
so
this
presents
a
question
that
could
not
have
been
specifically
contemplated
at
the
time
when
the
first
amendment
was
adopted.
and
to
say,
well,
because
nobody
was
--
because
descriptions
in
a
book
of
violence
were
not
considered
a
category
of
speech
that
was
appropriate
for
limitation
at
the
time
when
the
first
amendment
was
violated
is
entirely
artificial.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
be
clear
about
exactly
what
your
argument
is.
your
argument
is
that
there
is
nothing
that
a
state
can
do
to
limit
minors'
access
to
the
most
violent,
sadistic,
graphic
video
game
that
can
be
developed.
that's
your
argument--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--is
it
or
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
say
there
is
no
problem
because
16-year-olds
in
california
never
have
$50
available
to
go
buy
a
video
game,
and
because
they
never
have
tvs
in
their
room
and
their
parents
are
always
home
watching
what
they
--
they
do
with
their
video
games,
and
the
parents
--
and
the
video
games
have
features
that
allow
parents
to
block
access
to
--
to
block
the
playing
of
violent
video
games,
which
can't
be
overcome
by
a
computer-savvy
california
16-year-old,
that's
why
there
is
no
problem,
right?
