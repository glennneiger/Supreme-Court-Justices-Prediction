justice
sonia
sotomayor
on
the
ground
that
the
court
here,
the
federal
court,
decided
that
they
weren't
predominant
issues
based
mostly
on
the
fact
that,
like
the
virginia
court
has
now,
it's
decided
that
there
is
no
economic
loss,
what
were
the
differences?
what
were
the
differences
here?
how
would
the
difference
in
standard
play
out
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
--
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
mean
to
cut
you
off,
but
you're
really
arguing
that
due
process
requires
the
same
treatment,
essentially,
of
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
that
we
are
giving
to
a
substantive
decision
that
blocks
a
future
member
from
pursuing
his
or
her
claim,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
almost
treating
it
as
a
property
right,
and
--
and
you're
basically
saying
we're
equating
it
with,
essentially,
a
property
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
we
disagree
with
you,
because
there
is
a
difference
of
some
sort
between
procedure
and
substantive
rights,
then
what
would
command
the
due
process
violation
in
a
situation
in
which
the
federal
litigation
has
applied
essentially
the
same
standard
that
the
state
has
and
there
has
been
adequate
representation
on
the
procedural
question,
where
no
substantive
right
of
a
plaintiff
has
been
extinguished?
that's
a
lot
of
conditions,
but
those
are
the
three
conditions
of
this
case.
so
what
in
due
process
requires
that
outcome,
your
outcome?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
extinguishing
a
substantive
right?
return
to
my
question
of
what
makes
a
procedural
right
substantive.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
actually
not
true.
the
plaintiff
here
received
the
same
thing.
the
issue
is
how
much
money
the
lawyers
are
going
to
receive,
really,
because
plaintiff
gets
their
attorney's
fees,
gets
a
statutory
violation
amount,
which
is
going
to
be
the
same
whether
it's
in
a
class
action
or
an
individual
action,
so
it's
really
not
the
plaintiff
who
stands
to
win.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
under
the
anti-injunction
act,
would
it
permit
a
blanket
injunction
that
says,
against
all
future
state
court
class
proceedings
across
the
united
states?
could
a
court
just
order
a
re-litigation
bar?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
my
question
to
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
articulate
what
we're
comparing
when
we're
saying
that
the
relitigation
bar
can
apply
to
a
procedural
ruling.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
started
a
little
bit
on
the
question.
is
there
any
requirement
that
that
issue
have
been
fully
and
fairly
adjudicated
in
the
prior
proceedings?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
say
--
you
talked
about
different
standards.
your
adversary
said
that
in
this
state
reliance
doesn't
need
to
be
proven.
let's
assume
that
fact.
and
the
district
court's
ruling
here
was
based
on
a
reliance
requirement
and
said
no
predominance
because
each
individual
plaintiff
will
have
to
prove
reliance.
does
that
become
the
same
--
a
different
standard
or
no?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
--
i'm
posing
it
as
a
hypothetical.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
a
hypothetical.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
see,
the
problem
is
that
i
don't
know
how
you
get
and
when
you
get
to
the
question
of
whether
reliance
needs
to
be
proven
or
not,
if
you're
going
to
bar
the
state
court
from
reaching
that
--
that
substantive
question,
not
that
substantive
issue,
but
that
substantive
question,
which
is
not
very
different
from
here,
which
is
what
does
economic
loss
require
in
terms
of
proof?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i'm
shifting
them
only
to
try
to
get--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--a
sense
of
what
different
standards
mean--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
you,
and
how
we
articulate
that
rule
in
a
way
that
doesn't
preclude
--
doesn't
permit
the
barring--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--of
claims
when
there
is
a
different
standard.
