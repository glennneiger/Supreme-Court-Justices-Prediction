justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
a
class
action
based
on
diversity
is
filed
in
one
of
the
federal
districts
in
west
virginia
and
the
district
court
denies
class
certification.
the
same
plaintiff,
the
same
plaintiff's
attorney,
takes
the
old
complaint,
writes
in
the
name
of
the
new
named
party,
files
exactly
the
same
complaint
in
another
federal
--
in
the
other
federal
district
in
west
virginia.
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
that
can
go
forward,
get
another
shot
at
class
certification?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
they
have
no
obligation
to
follow
another
district
court
opinion,
do
they?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
--
what
is
the
difference
between
the
federal
law
and
the
west
virginia
law
on
the
class
certification
issue?
not
the
application
to
this
particular
complaint,
but
as
to
the
--
the
standard.
what
do
you
see
as
the
difference
between
the
federal
standard
and
the
west
virginia
standard?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
kind
of
notice
do
you
think
due
process
would
require?
if
the
court
in
which
the
case
was
first
filed
thought,
i'm
not
going
waste,
i
don't
want
to
waste
my
time
on
this
class
certification
issue
if
it's
just
going
to
be
relitigated
over
and
over
and
over
again,
so
i
want
to
provide
sufficient
notice
so
that
the
members
of
a
class
will
be
bound
by
my
--
by
my
class
certification
issue,
what
--
what
would
have
to
be
done?
would
they
all
have
to
be
given
individual
notice
and
asked
to
opt
out?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
wouldn't
it
be
a
violation
--
wouldn't
it
be
a
violation
of
due
process
if
congress
enacted
a
statute
or
if
there
were
a
rule
adopted
that
said
that
the
first
ruling
on
class
certification
by
a
federal
court
binds
all
members
of
the
class
in
any
other
federal
litigation?
would
that
be
a
--
they
would
retain
their
individual
claims,
but
there
could
not
be
another
--
another
class
action
--
another
class
action
filed.
would
that
be
a
due
process
violation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
is
there
a
due
process
right
to
have
class
action?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
congress
just
decided
to
get
rid
of
class
actions
altogether?
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
