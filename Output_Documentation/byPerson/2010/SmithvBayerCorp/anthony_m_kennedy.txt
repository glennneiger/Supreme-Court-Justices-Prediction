well,
of
course
you're
arguing
the
principle.
what
would
have
happened
if
the
class
had
gone
--
those
who
wanted
to
be
in
the
class
had
gone
first
to
the
west
virginia
court
and
the
west
virginia
court
had
denied
class
certification?
would
that
preclude
a
later
federal
court
from
granting
class
certification?
justice

but
just
on
notice,
does
the
record
show
when
the
client
first
came
to
the
attorney?
