justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
a
totally
different
party,
if
a
person,
say
an
intervenor,
joins
a
litigation
late,
and
there
have
been
a
lot
of
procedural
rulings,
i
guess
that
that
intervenor
takes
the
case
as
he
finds
it?
he
can
go
to
the
judge
and
say:
judge,
i
want
you
to
reconsider
your
procedural
ruling
in
light
of
the
fact
i'm
here.
how
does
the
situation
i
have
just
sketched
differ
from
this
one?
i
mean,
you
have
a
client
who's
coming
to
the
litigation
late.
he's
separate
from
the
litigation,
i
know,
but
he
could
send
a
representative
to
the
judge
and
say:
judge,
i
want
you
to
reconsider
in
light
of
the
fact
i'm
joining.
now,
i
know
i'm
not
joining;
in
fact,
i'm
bringing
a
different
case.
but
i'm
thinking
of
the
--
of
the
chief
justice's
hypo
here
and
i'm
--
and
i'm
trying
to
apply
it.
and
is
your
client
analogous
to
that
person
who
joins
litigation
late?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
it
ever
happen,
did
you
ever
come
across
an
instance
before
where
in
a
federal
court
a
judge
in
a
district
court
said,
no,
you
can't
have
a
certification,
no;
and
then
a
different
plaintiff
went
to
a
different
federal
court
in
a
different
part
of
the
country
and
asked
for
a
similar
certification?
have
you
ever
found
anything
like
that
in
precedent,
that
it's
in
two
federal
courts
rather
than
the
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
did
they
say
--
did
they
say
in
--
in
that
case
that
the
second
judge
is
bound
as
a
matter
of
stare
decisis,
or
is
he
bound
as
a
matter
of
collateral
estoppel?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
the
same
issue
as
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
know
that
in
the
record,
that
the
attorneys
didn't
even
know
about
each
other's
cases?
is
that
borne
out?
i
mean,
is
that
an
issue?
