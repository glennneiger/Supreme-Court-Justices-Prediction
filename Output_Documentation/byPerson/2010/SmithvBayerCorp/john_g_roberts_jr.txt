chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
09-1205,
smith
versus
bayer
corporation.
mr.
monahan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
how
far
does
your
procedural
right
extend?
let's
say
in
the
second
action
the
court
says,
look,
we've
been
through
all
this
before;
we
have
had
a
million
pages
of
discovery
from
the
prior
action,
no
protective
order
at
all.
so
while
if
you
were
the
first
person
here,
you're
entitled
to,
you
know,
ten
interrogatories,
because
we
have
been
through
this
before,
i'm
going
to
say
you
can
look
at
all
the
discovery
that's
there,
but
you
only
get
five
interrogatories.
now,
do
you
say
no,
no,
no,
i'm
entitled
to
the
same
procedural
rights
i
would
have
if
i
were
here
first?
is
that
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
now
it's
not
only
that
you're
entitled
to
your
day
in
court
substantively;
you're
--
you're
entitled
to
your
day
in
court
procedurally
as
to
some
procedural
aspects
but
not
others?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
beck.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
a
very
subjective
decision
whether
the
lawyer
is
--
right
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--whether
the
--
the
lawyer
is
adequate
or
not.
people
have
different
kind
of
views
about
what
kind
of
lawyer
they
want,
and
i
can
see
someone
who
doesn't
even
know
that
this
action
is
going
on
saying,
i
don't
care
if
you
think
the
lawyer
is
adequate,
i
don't
think
he
is;
besides
i
wanted
--
you
know,
my
brother-in-law
to
be
the
lawyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
to
say
--
it's
odd
to
say
you're
precluded.
the
whole
point
is
the
basic
principle
that
you're
entitled
to
your
day
in
court,
and
you're
saying
well,
you're
not
entitled
to
your
day
in
court
if
somebody
else
had
a
day
in
court
and
they
had
a
good
lawyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
thank
you.
mr.
monahan,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
