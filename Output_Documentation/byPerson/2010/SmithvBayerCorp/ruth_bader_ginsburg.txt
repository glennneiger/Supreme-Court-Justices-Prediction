bader

all
you
have
to
do
is
get
a
new
named
plaintiff?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
can
be
the
same
attorney?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
the
--
would
the
decision
that's
saying
--
saying
rule
23
standards
have
not
been
met,
the
individual
issues
predominate
over
the
common
issue
--
doesn't
that
deserve
some
measure
of
respect
when
the
same
thing
is
tried
again?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
one
was
determined
by
the
multidistrict
panel,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
absent
class
members
retain
their
individual
right.
they
are
not
being
precluded
as
to
their
individual
claim.
it's
only
they
can't
be
a
class
representative.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
right
to
read
the
supplemental
brief
as
saying
that
now,
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
agrees
with
the
multidistrict
panel
on
what
the
content
of
west
virginia
law
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here
you
have
a
different
forum;
pick
up
a
different
plaintiff,
and
you
go
to
a
different
forum.
how
--
and
i
guess
your
answer
is
that
you
could
go
on
and
on
and
on
until
--
until
maybe
you
find
a
judge
who
will
certify
this
class.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
have
a
new
plaintiff,
so
that
plaintiff
wouldn't
have
had
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
--
to
be
heard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
there
are
50
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
50
states.
and
if
the
plaintiff
was
asking
for
a
nationwide
class
action--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
couldn't
know,
they
--
when
they
went
to
the
west
virginia
supreme
court,
that
was
before
this
white
v.
wyatt.
they
were
arguing
a
question
of
substantive
law:
what
do
we
have
to
show
in
order
to
get
damages,
when
we
say
we
weren't
hurt
by
the
drug,
we're
saying
--
we're
not
saying
we
didn't
get
any
benefit
from
it.
we're
just
saying
we
paid
more
money
for
it
than
we
should
because
it
wasn't
of
the
quality
that
it
was
represented
to
be.
when
the
federal
judge
said,
having
to
make
a
determination
of
west
virginia
law,
no,
it's
not
the
law;
you
have
to
show
causation,
some
harm
to
you.
but
then
when
they
--
when
these
plaintiffs
went
to
the
west
virginia
court,
that
was
still
an
open
question
of
west
virginia
law,
and
the
west
virginia
courts
might
have
decided
it
differently
than
the
federal
court,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
sometimes
federal
judges,
they
try
their
best,
they're
not
the
last
word
on
what
the
state
law
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
these
petitioners.
they
weren't
parties
to
the
case
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
answer
that
they
have
claims
that
do
not
involve
the
consumer?
whatever
it
is
that
--
they
have
fraud
claims
and
some
other
kind
of
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
beck,
if
you're
right
about
issue
preclusion,
then
if
bayer
had
gone
into
the
west
virginia
court
and
said,
west
virginia
court,
judge
davis
has
decided
this
case
in
minnesota
federal
district
court;
issue
preclusion,
that's
one
thing.
but
what
was
used
here
was
quite
a
heavy
gun,
and
that
is
the
--
an
empty
suit
injunction,
which
seems
to
say:
we're
not
going
to
trust
the
west
virginia
court
to
apply
issue
preclusion.
we're
going
to
stop
that
court
from
proceeding
altogether.
and
the
anti-suit
injunction
is
--
it's
a
very
strong
weapon,
and
even
though
it's
the
--
the
clients
who
are
being
precluded,
it's
really
saying
to
another
court:
we're
not
even
going
to
let
you
get
to
this
question,
we're
going
to
stop
you.
so
maybe
you
could
be
right
about
preclusion
but
wrong
about
use
of
the
anti-suit
injunction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
true
about
--
that's
true
about
preclusion,
but
--
and
so
that
you
might
go
into
the
west
virginia
court
and
say
this
second
plaintiff
should
be
precluded,
but
as
justice
kagan
pointed
out,
you're
dealing
with
the
anti-injunction
statute
that
talks
about
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
--
that's
often
theoretical
because
on
these
small
claims,
it's
class
action
or
nothing.
nobody's
going
to
pay
a
lawyer
to
go
to
court
with
a
$100
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
have
to
--
i
think
you
would
concede
that
the
seventh
circuit,
now
two
decisions,
one
in
bridgestone
and
then
the
other
in
thorogood,
the
seventh
circuit
thinks
it
can
do
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
i
just
go
back
to
what
you
said
before?
i
thought
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
said
you
can't
have
actions
for
drugs
under
the
consumer
whatever.
