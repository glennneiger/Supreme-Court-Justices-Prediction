mr.
philip
s.
beck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
core
issue
here
is
whether
absent
class
members
can
be
bound
by
a
denial
of
class
certification
where
there
was
adequate
representation
on
that
issue,
but
not
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
the
issue
that
was
decided
and
preclusive
was
the
issue
of
predominance,
your
honor,
and
what
happened
there
is
that
judge
davis,
the
judge
who
was
supervising
the
multidistrict
litigation,
he
made
a
determination
under
west
virginia
law
as
to
what's
required
to
make
out
an
economic
loss
claim,
and
he
concluded
that
what
is
required
is
individual
proof
of
injury
as
well
as
individual
proof
of
causation,
and
then
he
went
on
to
describe
what
kind
of
evidence
would
be
necessary
to
do
that.
so
he
made
a
legal
determination,
and
then
he
went
--
and
then
after
looking
at
what
kind
of
evidence
would
be
required
--
excuse
me
--
made
a,
i
think
a
mixed
law
and
fact
determination
that
given
that,
individual
issues
would
predominate
over
common
issues.
his
--
his
interpretation
of
west
virginia
law
was
later
vindicated
by
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
in
white,
where
they
held
that
--
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
individual
proof
of
injury,
which
had
been
contested
by
petitioners,
and
it's
clear
that
it's
going
to
require
the
same
exact
kind
of
inquiry.
so
what
we
have
is
that
there's
no
suggestion
in
rezulin
or
anywhere
else
that
the
predominance
requirement
under
the
west
virginia
version
of
rule
23,
which
is
essentially
identical
to
the
federal
version,
has
any
other
content
that's
different
from
the
federal
version.
in
rezulin
there's
a
suggestion
that
when
--
that
the
west
virginia
courts
would
treat
differences
in
--
in
damages
or
reliance
as
less
significant
than
some
federal
courts,
but
nothing
at
all
that
suggests
in
any
way
that
if
the
underlying
cause
of
action
requires
individual
proof
of
injury
and
causation,
that
somehow
that
common
questions
are
going
to
predominate
over
individual
questions.
there's
no
suggestion
of
that--
mr.
philip
s.
beck
--yes.
well,
yes
--
when
the
federal
district
judge
made
the
determination,
it
was
in
mr.
mccollins's
case,
and
he's
called
upon
to
resolve
questions
of
state
law
just
like
courts
are
every
day
in
diversity
actions;
and
he
resolved
the
question
of
state
law,
what's
required
by
the
west
virginia
consumer
credit
and
protection
act.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
and
some
--
and
your
honor,
if
--
if
for
example,
judge
davis
had
found
as
he
did
in
mccollins,
and
then
he
had
issued
the
same
injunction,
and
then
the
white
case
had
come
down
the
other
way,
that
--
that
says
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
injury,
then
conceivably
the
petitioners
could
have
gone
back
to
judge
davis
and
asked
for
relief
from
his
injunction,
and
then
we
would
have
an
interesting
question.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
no,
but
they
were
--
they
were
parties
to
the
injunction
proceeding.
they
were
the
defendants
in
the
injunction
proceeding.
so
they're
subject
to
an
injunction,
and
then
--
then
the
law
changes,
or
the
law
is
declared
differently
by
the
west
virginia
supreme
court.
nothing
would
have
precluded
them
from
coming
back
in
front
of
judge
davis
and
said
respectfully,
sir,
you
--
you
were
wrong
in
your
prediction,
and
we
would
like
to
be
relieved
from
the
injunction,
and
then
we
would
have
a
very
interesting
question
about
whether
being
correct
or
incorrect
is
--
is
something
that
can
eliminate
the
law
of
preclusion;
because
normally
if
--
if
a
party
is
precluded,
they're
not
allowed
to
say
i
shouldn't
be
precluded
because
i
think
the
judge
made
a
mistake
on
the
law.
but
we
don't
have
that
here
because,
in
fact,
judge
davis
was
vindicated
on
--
when
it
comes
to
west
virginia
law--
mr.
philip
s.
beck
--yes.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
i
think
that,
actually,
judge
davis
took
into
account
the
difference
in
tone,
and
he
looked
very
carefully
at
rezulin,
and
he
said
that
what
rezulin
was
focusing
on
was
individual
questions
of
damages,
which
defendants
often
argue
is
enough
so
that
individual
questions
predominate,
individual
questions
of
reliance,
which
we
also
often
argue
mean
that
individual
questions
predominate.
but
he
said
this
is
different,
because
this
is,
in
order
to
prove
liability,
they've
got
to
establish
individual
injury,
which
means,
on
a
person-by-person
basis,
either
that
they
were
harmed
by
the
drug
or
that
the
drug
didn't
work
to
lower
their
cholesterol
as
--
as
it
was
supposed
to,
and
they
have
to
show
that
whatever
the
violation
of
the
consumer
fraud
act
was
is
causally
linked
there.
and
he
said
that's
a
different
animal
from
questions
of
reliance
and
damages,
and
--
and
i've
heard
or
read
no
conceivable
explanation
about
how,
under
any
standard
of
predominance,
you
could
have
common
questions
predominating
when
every
single
member
of
the
class
is
going
to
have
to
examine
the
medical
records
to
see
whether
their
cholesterol
came
down,
whether
they
suffered
any
side
effects,
and
--
and
if
their
cholesterol
didn't
come
down
and
they
did
suffer
side
effects,
how
that
could
be
linked
to
a
violation
of
the
consumer
fraud
act.
so
what
judge
--
judge
davis
didn't
depart
from
rezulin
at
all.
judge
davis
said
this
goes
to
core
questions
of
liability,
and
as
i
interpret
the
west
virginia
statute,
in
order
to
establish
liability,
they're
going
to
have
to
show
that
on
an
individual-by-individual
basis,
and
the
relevance
of
white
is
that
he's
correct.
of
course,
white
even
goes
further
and
says
because
of
that
there's
no
cause
of
action
under
the
west
virginia
consumer
credit
and
protection
act.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
a
warranty
claim,
your
honor.
there
was
also
a
warranty
claim
in
the
mccollins
case,
the
original
federal
case.
their
warranty
claim
is
no
different,
and
the
requirements
of
a
warranty
claim
are
no
different.
fraud
obviously
requires
individual
proof
of
injury
and
causation.
the
fraud
is
--
i
mean,
the
consumer
fraud
act
is
--
is
an
effort
to
make
it
easier
for
plaintiffs
to
make
out
a
cause
of
action.
if
you
can't
make
out
a
cause
of
action
under
the
consumer
fraud
act,
it
certainly
can't
be
made
out
under
fraud.
and
in
terms
of
preclusion
law,
what
the
eighth
circuit
observed
was
that
when
there's
the
--
the
same
core
set
of
facts
that
make
out
a
cause
of
action,
adding
another
label
to
it
doesn't
change
the
preclusion
analysis.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
well,
your
honor,
the
--
any
time
that
someone
invokes
the
relitigation
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act,
by
definition,
an
alternative
would
be
to
go
into
the
second
court
and
--
and
just
simply
plead
preclusion.
that
would
always
be
available.
and
if
that
were
sufficient,
then
there
would
be
no
relitigation
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act.
here's
a
reason
why
it's
very
important
in
a
case
like
this.
under
their
theory,
they
--
they
could
not
only
file
a
class
action
in
one
county
in
west
virginia,
and
then
if
we
couldn't
get
an
injunction
but
we
pled
preclusion,
and
if
--
and
if
we
prevailed,
they
could
file
one
in
another
county.
and
in
west
virginia,
county
judges
don't
look
to
judges
from
other
counties
of
stare
decisis.
and
so
they
could
go,
under
their
approach,
to
another
county,
and
that
judge
might
agree
with
us.
and
then
they
go
to
another
county,
and
eventually
they're
pretty
confident
that
they
would
find
one
judge
in
one
county
in
west
virginia
who
would
reject
our
preclusion
analysis
and
allow
the
case
to
go
forward.
and
in
west
virginia,
we
have
no
right
to
have
an
appeal
heard.
there
is
no
intermediate
appellate
court,
and
there's
no
appeal
of
right
to
the
west
virginia
supreme
court.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
if
the
--
if
the
west
virginia
court
had
denied
class
certification
on
an
issue
that
is
present
in
rule
23,
then
it
would
be
preclusive
under
rule
23.
it
would
be
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute,
where
federal
courts
have
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
state
judgments
to
the
same
extent
that
a
state
would.
if,
however,
your
honor,
the
court
said
in
west
virginia,
well,
they
meet
all
of
the
requirements
of
our
rule
23,
but
under
west
virginia
law
we
have
discretion
to
deny
a
class
even
if
they
meet
all
the
requirements
of
rule
23,
then
that
would
be
an
interesting
question,
because
under
federal
procedure,
under
this
court's
opinions,
if
someone
meets
all
the
requirements
of
rule
23,
then
class
certification
is
appropriate.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
in
--
in
the
mine-run
case,
but
we
don't
have
it.
we
--
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
case
is
unusual
is
that
we
actually
have
a
real-life
final
judgment
that
incorporates
the
denial
of
class
certification.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
well,
but
it
is
--
it
is
merged
into
the
judgment.
it's
explicitly
a
part
of
the
judgment.
it's
in
the
judgment
itself.
i
think
it's
our
joint
appendix
--
83,
is
it?
mr.
philip
s.
beck
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
tougher
question.
it's
posed
in
some
of
the
other
cases
percolating
up,
the
thorogood
case,
for
example,
or
some
of
them
out
of
the
seventh
circuit.
i
think
that
under
normal
preclusion
analysis,
decisions
that
have
not
reached
the
point
where
there's
a
formal
final
judgment
can
still
be
given
preclusive
effect
if
they're
sufficiently
final,
that
a
court
says
it's
exceedingly
unlikely
that
we
could
reconsider.
there's
another--
mr.
philip
s.
beck
--and
i
was
about
to
say,
your
honor,
that
--
that
under
the
anti-injunction
act
it
might
actually
be
a
different
analysis,
and
because
the
issue
isn't
present
here,
we
haven't
briefed
it,
but
i
could
see
under
the
--
looking
at
the
statutory
language
of
the
re-litigation
exception
that
talks
about
judgments
and
also
looking
to
the
federalism
concerns
that
--
that
inform
the
--
the
anti-injunction
act,
one
could
argue,
in
an
appropriate
case,
that
whatever
the
law
is
as
to
preclusion
generally,
when
it
comes
to
the
anti-injunction
act,
we're
going
to
require
more
in
the
form
of
a
--
of
a
formal
judgment
that
--
that
incorporates
the
particular
ruling.
as
i
said,
that's
not
our
case,
but--
mr.
philip
s.
beck
--i
think
it's
actually
--
while
--
while
it
was
collateral
to
the
summary
judgment
motion
on
mr.
mccollins'
individual
claim,
it's
actually
essential
to
the
judgment
in
--
in
terms
including
it,
in
terms
of
who's
bound
by
--
by
--
by
the
judgment.
if
class
certification
had
been
--
we
--
we
need
to
know
once
the
judge
has
ruled
on
class
certification,
whether
he's
granted
it
or
denied
it
in
order
to
know
who's
affected
by
the
judgment
on
the
merits
and
otherwise.
and
if
he
had
granted
the
motion
to
certify
the
class,
then
there
would
be
one
set
of
effects
coming
out
of
a
final
judgment.
if
he
denies
the
motion
to
certify
the
class,
there's
a
different
set
of
effects
that
come
out
of
the
judgment.
so,
it
is
essential
to
the
judgment,
in
our
mind,
and
incidentally
the
--
essential
to
the
judgment
point
under
preclusion
law
is
not
one
that
--
that
the
petitioners
have
ever
raised
below.
it's
not
one
that
is
in
their
questions
presented
or
their
cert
petition
or
their
brief.
so
this
isn't
an
issue
that
--
that
they've
preserved
or
argued,
but
we
do
believe,
quite
clearly,
that
the
class
certification
denial
was
an
integral
part
of
the
final
judgment,
and
--
and
obviously
it's
in
there
on
its
terms.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
in
this
court's
chick
kam
choo
decision,
there
was
an
emphasis
that
under
the
anti-injunction
act
you
have
to
have,
you
know,
the
same
issue
litigated,
and
there
was
a
concern
about
whether
there
was
a
significant
difference
in
standards.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
yes.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
yes.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
oh,
i
think
--
i
think
that
for
the
--
for
--
for
preclusion
to
apply,
even
before
one
gets
to
the
anti-injunction
act,
there's
a
requirement
that
the
issue
be
fully
and
fairly
litigated.
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
focus
would
be,
as
judge
davis's
was,
is
there
a
difference
in
--
in
the
class
certification
procedures
that
would
--
that
would
result
in
a
--
in
a
different
outcome,
given
the
particular
issue
that's
been
decided.
so
that
--
so
that
there
--
you
know,
i
could
conceive
of
issues
that
would
be
dispositive
in
a
federal
court
on
class
certification
that
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
certification
in
state
court.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
judge
davis's
opinion
was
not
based
in
any
way
on
reliance.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
if
a
state
court
had
said
that
this
thing,
that
--
that
reliance
or
whatever,
that
is
talked
about
so
much
in
federal
courts,
we
don't
care
about
that,
that's
not
part
of
our
standard,
then
--
then
that
would
be
--
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
federal
court's
decision,
then
i
think
you
would
be
applying
different
standards,
and
under
chick
kam
choo,
there
wouldn't
be
preclusion.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
well,
we're
--
we're
moving
now
from
what
is
in
rule
23
in
federal
and
state
jurisprudence
to
what
is
the
underlying
cause
of
action
when
we
--
when
--
you
know,
whether
reliance
is
a
part
of
the
plan.
we
keep
saying
"reliance"
and--
mr.
philip
s.
beck
--okay.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
okay.
and
--
and--
mr.
philip
s.
beck
--i
think--
mr.
philip
s.
beck
--i
think
--
i
think,
justice
sotomayor,
that
you
have
to
distinguish
between
rule
23
and
the
underlying
state
law
that's
the
subject
of
the
lawsuit.
and
anytime
a
--
a
federal
court
is
looking
at
whether
a
class
action
can
be
certified
for
a
violation
of
state
law,
it
has
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
--
of
what
state
law
is
in
terms
of
how
you
prove
a
violation,
what
the
elements
are.
and
that's
what
--
that's
just
--
you
have
to
do
that
every
single
day.
and
you
make
that
kind
of
determination,
and
then
you
move
to
the
next
step
of
whether
that
should
be
preclusive,
which
is
when
rule
23
comes
into
play.
and
i
think
that's
the
point
where
you
say,
are
the
state
standards
under
rule
23
different
from
the
federal
standards.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
well,
your
honor,
there
was
that
determination
in
this
case
at
the
injunction
stage.
they
did
claim
--
they
--
they
said,
well,
was
this
--
was
this
lawyer
from
west
virginia
who
made
exactly
the
same
arguments
that
they
made,
was
he
--
did
he
adequately
represent
our
interests.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
well,
adequacy
of
course
is
part
of
rule
23
analysis,
but
it's
also
independently
a
part
of
preclusion
law
analysis
where
in
order
to
be
precluded,
for
a
nonparty
to
be
precluded,
then
you
have
to
do
the
analysis
that's
called
for
in
taylor
v.
sturgell,
where
you
have
to
say
in
order
to
preclude
a
nonparty,
does
it
meet
the
two-part
test
of
taylor
v.
sturgell.
the
first
part:
were
their
interests
aligned?
here
their
interests
were
perfectly
aligned.
and
then
the
second
part
is
an
either/or:
did
the
party
in
the
first
action
understand
herself
--
in
this
case
himself
--
to
be
acting
in
a
representative
capacity
or
did
the
court
take
care
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
nonparty?
mr.
philip
s.
beck
i'm
sorry.
mr.
philip
s.
beck
well
--
and
in
every
preclusion
case
there's
a
--
there's
a
question
about
adequacy,
and
it
focuses
not
on
whether
someone
likes
the
lawyer
or
they've
got
a
brother-in-law
who
is
a
lawyer.
it
focuses
on
whether
the
parties'
interests
are
aligned,
and
mccollins'
interests
were
identical
to
mr.
smith's
and
ms.
sperlazza's;
and
it
--
and
it
points
to
whether
mr.
mccollins
understood
that
he
was
acting
in
a
representative
capacity
and
to
whether
judge
davis
took
care
to
protect
the
interests
of
nonparties.
so
it
doesn't
say
that
everybody
gets
to
pick
their
own
lawyer.
if
that
were
the
rule,
there
would
be
no
law
of
preclusion
because
nobody
would
ever
pick
the
same
lawyers.
my
--
one
other
point
i
want
to
make--
mr.
philip
s.
beck
--and
--
and
that
is
exactly
the
question
that
is
posed
by
nonparty
preclusion;
and
--
and
as
this
court's
opinion
in
taylor
v.
sturgell
said,
there
are
circumstances
where
a
nonparty
can
be
precluded
based
on
litigation
from
someone
else,
and
i
--
i
referenced
the
test,
and
the
first
point
i
wanted
to
make--
mr.
philip
s.
beck
--well
if--
mr.
philip
s.
beck
--it's
the
party
rather
than
the
lawyer,
and
--
and
it's
when
--
when
he
commenced
that
litigation
and
when
he
litigated
the
issue
that
we're
talking
about
of
class
certification,
there's
no
doubt
in
the
world
that
he
is
--
that
he
understood
himself
to
be
acting
on
behalf
of
a
class.
that
--
that's
why
he
was
litigating
class
certification,
and
--
and,
your
honor,
what
we
--
we
have
here
also,
because
we're
--
we're
kind
of
verging
into
the
due
process
analysis,
you
have
to
start
with
the
question
of
what
is
the
interest
that's
at
stake
here.
the
injunction
doesn't
forbid
any
--
any
plaintiff
from
pursuing
their
individual
claim
or
arguing
anything
they
want
about
underlying
west
virginia
law.
it
only
precludes
them
from
going
forward
in
a
class
action,
and
that
is--
mr.
philip
s.
beck
--these
i
don't
think
fall
in
that
category,
your
honor.
there's
--
it's
$200
statutory
penalty
per
violation,
which
means
per
prescription
refill.
there's
--
there's
attorney's
fees
on
top
of
that;
there's
punitive
damages
on
top
of
that.
the
mccollins
case
in
federal
court
was
that
kind
of
case,
and
he
pled
that
he
satisfied
the
jurisdictional
amount
of
$75,000.
but
even
if
it's
a
small
claim,
the
--
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
opportunity
to
litigate
it
in
a
class
action
and
join
other
parties
is
a
property
interest
that
implicates
due
process
protections.
that
is--
