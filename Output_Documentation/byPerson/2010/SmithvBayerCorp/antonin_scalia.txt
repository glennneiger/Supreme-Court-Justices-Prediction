of
course
you
--
you
would
say
that
the
subsequent
plaintiff
is
not
bound
if
he
was
not
given
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
opt
out,
even
if
he
came
back
to
the
same
court,
right?
it
would
be
a
stupid
thing
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he's
probably
going
to
lose.
but
you
would
say
he's
not
bound,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
--
i'm
the
--
i'm
the
party
trying
to
bring
the
later
class
action,
and
you
tell
me
i
can't
do
it
because
somebody
else
sought
a
class
action
and
--
and
it
--
and
it
was
denied.
and
i
say,
well,
i
don't
care,
i
--
you
know,
that's
somebody
else.
that
was
not
me.
i
was
not
--
and
not
only
was
i
not
a
party
to
that
case,
i
think
that
person
had
a
lousy
lawyer,
and
had
i
chosen
the
lawyer,
we
wouldn't
have
lost
that
point.
what's
your
response
to
that?
you
cannot
even
say,
as
you
can
where
the
class
has
been
certified,
well,
at
least
there
was
a
determination
by
some
judge
that
the
absent
parties
were
adequately
represented.
there
hasn't
been
even
that
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
that
ex
post,
you
litigate
this
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
it
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
possibly
find
that
in
the
first
action
the
lawyer
understood
that
he
was
acting
in
a
representative
capacity?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
tried
to
act
in
a
rep
--
but
--
but
his
representation
was
denied.
