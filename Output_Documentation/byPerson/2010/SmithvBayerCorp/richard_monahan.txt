mr.
richard
a.
monahan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
keith
smith
and
shirley
sperlazza
were
not
named
plaintiffs
in
the
prior
federal
proceeding
litigated
by
george
mccollins.
they
never
received
notice
of
that
prior
proceeding;
they
never
received
an
opportunity
to
appear
and
be
heard;
they
never
received
an
opportunity
to
opt
out;
and
they
never
received
an
opportunity
to
appeal
the
decision
denied
by
certification.
no
precedent
of
this
court
would
justify
treating
--
treating
people
as
parties
under
preclusion
principles
under
these
circumstances.
recently
in
taylor
v.
sturgell
this
court
addressed
the
rule
against
nonparty
preclusion
and
discussed
the
recognized
exceptions.
the
court
in
that
case
discussed
a
properly
conducted
class
action
as
being
one
of
the
exceptions.
the
court
in
discussing
these
preclusion
rules
noted
that
they
are
limited
by
due
process
concerns,
and
the
court
noted
that
the
properly
conducted
class
action
is
an
exception
due
to
the
due
process
protections
incorporated
into
rule
23.
obviously,
this
court
has
discussed
the
due
process
protections
with
class
actions
in
prior
cases,
particularly
those
dealing
with
23(b)(3)
classes
in
cases
such
as
eisen
and
shutts.
the
court
has
noted
that
whenever
a
class
is
certified
notice
must
be
provided;
the
right
to
--
notice
must
be
provided;
they
must
have
the
right
to
appear
and
be
heard
in
person
or
by
counsel;
they
must
have
the
right
to
opt
out
as
well
as
protection
of
adequate
representation.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
your
honor,
under
the
--
yes,
under
those
circumstances,
as
outlined
by
--
by
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
yes,
as
long
as
it's
not
the
same
party.
if
it's
a
different
party--
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
--yes,
it
could
be
the
same
attorney.
this
court
noted
that
in
taylor
v.
sturgell,
in
south
--
south
central
bell
v.
alabama,
and
also
as
discussed
in
the
richards
case.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
yes,
your
honor,
but
that
would
be
under
stare
decisis
principles,
we
believe,
and
that's
the
situation,
since
it
is
a
different
party,
since
it's
not
the
same
party
itself.
and
certainly
the
district
courts
in
west
virginia
would
look
to
other
district
courts'
opinions
and
would
likely
render
them
persuasive,
or
consider
them
persuasive,
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
technically,
no,
your
honor.
if
the
fourth
circuit,
for
instance,
had
spoken
on
the
matter,
though,
and
it
was
something
that
was
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit,
or
of
course
by
this
court,
then
clearly
they
would.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
yes.
yes,
a
district
judge
in
minnesota.
yes,
your
honor.
interestingly,
in
taylor,
this
court
noted
that
adopting
a
broad
theory
of
virtual
representation
based
upon
an
identity
of
interests,
adequate
representation,
and
a
close
relationship
would
--
would,
in
essence,
be
equivalent
to
adopting
a
de
facto
class
action
or
recognizing
a
common
law
class
action
without
any
of
the
procedural
due
process
protections
provided
by
rule
23.
obviously,
in
dealing
with
these
cases,
the
main
reason
a
certification
is
--
the
main
reason
the
due
process
protections
are
provided
upon
certification
is
to
go
ahead
and
justify
binding
the
class
members
to
any
judgment
issued
by
the
court
at
that
point.
until
you
have
that,
unless
you
have
the
certification
and
the
due
process
protections
for
a
rule
23(b)(3)
class,
until
you
have
those,
the
absent
class
members
remain
strangers
to
the
proceeding.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
that's
--
that's
true,
your
honor.
we
submit,
however,
that
any
procedural
rights
which
have
been
recognized
and
adopted,
those
procedural
rights,
just
as
the
substantive
claim,
itself,
have
to
be
adjudicated
consistent
with
due
process.
and
west
virginia
itself
has
adopted
rule
23
of
the
west
virginia
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
that
state
has
the
right
to
apply
and
interpret
that
rule
as
it
sees
fit
to
manage
its
own
docket
and
administrate
its
own
docket
as
it
sees
fit.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
all
of
the
issues
raised
in
our
petition
for
cert
remain
just
as
they
were.
at
worst,
if
white
v.
wyatt
withstands
petition
for
rehearing,
at
worst
we
lose
our
ccpa
claim.
that
certainly
is
a
valuable
claim
to
us.
i
will
not
dispute
that.
but
we
also
have
a
common
law
fraud
claim.
we
also
have
breach
of
warranty
claims,
and
those
are
still
in
existence.
and
the
critical
fact
of
this
case
in
that
regard
is,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
class
may
be
certified
under
west
virginia
rules
of
civil
procedure
has
never
been
litigated,
has
never
been
decided
by
any
court.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
your
honor,
i
believe
it
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
that
state
has
said
that
not
only
are
we
going
to
look
at
these
federal
decisions
as
being
persuasive,
but
we're
going
to
consider
ourself
bound
by
the
decisions
of
the
fourth
circuit
or
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
west
virginia.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
well,
for
instance,
what
your
honor
suggested
is
essentially
what
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
does.
i
mean,
they
will
--
they
will
consider
them
to
be
persuasive.
they
will
consider
them
--
but
in
their
in
re
rezulin
case,
the
court
noted
--
the
court
actually
criticized
the
circuit
judge
for
relying
exclusively
on
federal
decisions
denying
class
certification
in
medical
device
or
prescription
drug
cases.
and
the
court
noted
that,
you
know,
although
we
will
look
at
those
rules
and
they
may
be
persuasive,
they
are
not
binding
or
controlling
on
us,
and
that
is
because
we
do
not
want
our
legal
analysis
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
mere
pavlovian
response
to
federal
decisional
rules.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
the
main
difference,
justice
alito,
is
that
our
court
has
--
and
they
cite
this
in
in
re
rezulin,
for
instance.
they
cite
neuberger
on
class
actions
as
one
of
the
authorities
to
support
this
principle,
but
they
note
that
in
--
in
our
court
that
normally
challenges
based
upon
reliance,
causation,
and
damages
will
not
bar
certification
on
a
predominance
basis,
because
those
go
to
the
right
of
the
individual
to
recover,
but
not
to
the
overall
liability
issues
of
the
defendant,
which
it
believes
can
be
addressed
as
common
issues
in
many
cases
and
save
the
court
an
extreme
amount
of
time
addressing
those
common
issues.
now,
the
court
indicates
that
if
individual
trials
need
to
be
conducted
later
on,
on
any
of
those
issues,
if
there
are
truly
individual
issues
that
need
to
be
resolved
concerning
those
claims,
individual
trials
can
be
accomplished.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
well,
for
instance
--
and
this
is
an
interesting
aspect
of
this
case
--
the
court's
not
only
trying
to
bind
us
on
the
procedural
ruling,
but
is
also
trying
to
bind
us
in
a
substantive
ruling
as
to
what
the
elements
of
the
claims
in
west
virginia
are
and
as
to
what's
needed
to
prove
those
claims.
for
instance,
the
eighth
circuit
has
--
has
held
that
in
looking
at
the
district
court's
opinion,
that
it
has
held
that
an
actual
physical
injury
is
required,
but
economic
loss
alone
is
not
enough.
clearly,
that's
not
consistent
with
west
virginia
law.
an
economic
loss
alone
can
be
sufficient.
in
west--
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
--yes,
very
similar,
your
honor.
i
mean,
in
this
circumstance
--
i
mean,
these
rights
are
provided.
these
procedural
rights,
once
they
are
created,
are
being
provided,
and
they
can't
be
taken
away
without
due
process.
west
virginia
has
recognized
the
right
to
--
to
proceed
in
our
court
under
our
rule,
and
not
--
you
don't
have
to
guarantee--
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
--well,
i
think
--
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
your
honor,
is
that
these
type
of
procedural
rights
--
whenever
you
have
a
substantive
claim,
which
is
a
property
right,
and
you
seek
to
litigate
them,
you
shall
have
available
to
you
all
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
have
been
adopted
and
recognized,
and
those
procedural
elements
of
the
claim
should
be
treated
or
adjudicated
just
the
same
as
a
substantive
claim,
consistent
with
due
process--
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
--i
believe
that
the
basic
--
because
we
are
not
the
same
party,
we
believe
the
basic
elements
are
just
the
notice
and
the
right
to
be
heard,
which
our
party
has
never
had.
may
i--
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
--well,
this
particular
procedural
right
is
very
closely
connected
--
i
mean,
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
a
class
action
is
to
level
the
economic
playing
field
and
to
enable
people
with
small
individual
claims
to
aggregate
them
in
order
to
seek
justice.
without
those--
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
--no,
your
honor,
what
--
what
--
the
assumptions
you
just
made
i
don't
believe
are
correct
in
this
--
in
this
particular
case,
because,
one,
obviously
if
we
lose
the
ccpa
claim
in
light
of
the
white
case,
there
would
be
no
statutory
attorney
fees.
and
even
if
we
had
the
ccpa
claim,
it's
--
the
court
has
discretion,
it
may
award
them.
there's
no
requirement
that
it
do
so,
no
requirement
whatsoever.
and
how
can
anybody
bring
--
any
lawyer
trying
to
bring
one
of
these
small
damage
claims,
if
the
damages
are
only
$100,
$200
per
plaintiff,
for
instance,
how
could
any
lawyer
justify
facing
a
defendant
such
as
bayer
in
a
complex
product
liability
action?
just
the
cost
alone
of
having
experts,
of
doing
discovery,
all
those
matters
would
greatly
exceed
the
value
of
the
claim
itself.
so
the
class
action
is
the
only
way
in
which
to
aggregate
the
claims
and
level
the
economic
playing
field
for
everybody.
the
other
thing,
i
would
note
for
the
common
law
fraud
claim
west
virginia
does
have
a
bad
faith
exception
for
attorney
fees,
but
that
depends
on
the
degree
of
fraud
that
the
court
finds,
and
that
--
that
in
and
of
itself
is
discretionary.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
does
have
some
flexibility,
depending
upon
the
procedural
role
at
issue.
and
in
essence,
the
court
is
applying
almost
essentially
the
stare
decisis
type
of
principles
there.
we
have
resolved
this
exact
discovery
issue
before,
the
exact--
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
--well,
i
certainly
think
the
court
needs
to
examine
the
procedural
aspect
and
its
importance,
and
the
part
that
it
plays.
i
mean,
for
instance,
one
of
the
problems
we
have
in
this
situation
is
that
normally
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
do
not
normally
apply
to
mere
procedural
rulings.
they're
not
normally
used
for
that
purpose.
most
cases
where
they
are
used
for
that
purpose
are
cases
where
a
dismissal
has
occurred
based
upon
a
procedural
ruling
or
a
procedural
failing.
and
whenever
they
apply
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata,
it's
almost
--
every
case
i
have
seen
deals
with
the
exact
same
party
in
another
proceeding.
and
there
they
preclude
them.
but
here
it's
a
totally
different
party.
and
the
issue
under
west
virginia
law
has
never
been
litigated
by
any
court.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
no,
your
honor,
because
--
i
mean,
for
instance,
this
court
has
noted
--
and
they
note
it,
i
believe
in
the
--
you
noted
it
in
the
richards
case.
the
chase
national
bank
v.
norwalk
and
martin
v.
wilks
has
noted
that
a
stranger
to
litigation
has
no
duty
to
seek
to
intervene
in
the
case;
however,
they
can;
they
can
seek
to
intervene
if
they
have
notice,
if
they
so
choose.
if
you
take
that
affirmative
step
to
intervene,
knowing
what
has
happened
in
that
case,
you
obviously
have
notice
of
the
case
because
you're
choosing
to
intervene.
and
if
you
seek
to
intervene
having
that
notice,
then
you
take
it
as
you
find
it.
now,
you
can
certainly
ask
the
court
to
reconsider
because
you
want
to
raise
new
arguments,
but
there
would
be
no
obligation
to
do
so.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case
because
there
are
limitations
to
that.
one
would
be,
i
think,
if
you
filed
at
another
federal
court,
for
instance,
rule
23
would
be
the
same
legal
standard.
federal
rule
23
is
the
same
legal
standard
in
all
federal
courts.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
for
preclusion
purposes,
that's
correct.
but
i
think
the
federal
court
certainly
would
look
at
those
cases
for
stare
decisis
purposes
and
looking
as
to
whether
or
not
the
class
should
be
certified
under
the
same
legal
standard.
now,
here
we
do
have
a
different
forum.
we
have
the
state
of
west
virginia
is
a
separate
sovereign,
has
its
own
rights
to
do
this.
but,
once
--
once
--
if
a
class
would
be
denied
in
west
virginia
at
one
time,
i
believe
that
the
chances
of
having
another
one
succeed
are
very
low,
because
courts
will
look
to
those
stare
decisis
principles--
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
issue
with
that,
though,
is
this
court
has
--
in
taylor
v.
sturgell,
for
instance,
which
your
honor
authored,
the
government
argued
in
that
case
that,
you
know,
we
should
adopt
this
virtual
representation
theory
because
of
repetitive
litigation.
we
had
this
foia
request.
any
person
out
there
could
file
asking
the
government
for
these
documents
and
the
government
may
have
to
go
on
thousands
of
times,
millions
of
times
conceivably
to
do
this.
and
this
court
note
--
noted
that
the
threat
of
repetitive
litigation
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
adopting
a
new
exception
to
the
rule
against
nonparty
preclusion.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
your
honor,
i
--
i
believe
so.
i
believe
--
i
mean,
consistent
with
shutts,
this
court's
ruling
in
shutts
and
eisen,
i
think
they
would,
because
once
they
had
the
notice
and
that
they
would
decide
not
to
opt
out,
then
they
would
be
bound
by
any
ruling
that
the
--
that
the
court
issues
there.
but
if
--
if
they
don't
have
that
opportunity,
especially
whenever
--
and
this
case
also
involves
the
anti-injunction
act,
of
course,
the
principles
of
federalism
and
comity,
and
any
question
under
the
anti-injunction
act,
any
doubt
should
go
against
issuing
injunctions.
and
the
--
the
exceptions
to
that
act
are
narrowly
construed
in
light
of
principles
of
federalism,
and
because
we
do
have
a
separate
state
here
and
we're
trying
to
apply
or
seek
state
relief
and
seek
the
state
rules
and
follow
the
state
rules,
i
do
believe
you
would
need
the
same
notice
that
we
have
in
shutts,
the
notice,
the
opportunity
to
appear
and
the
opportunity
to
opt
out.
now,
certainly
other
issues
--
if
we're
talking
about
policy
concerns,
another
thing
i
would
note
is
that
in
cafa
recently
--
whenever
congress
adopted
cafa,
certainly
if
they
believe
that
basing
one
--
using
one
class
denial
in
federal
court
as
a
basis
to
preclude
all
other
similar
classes
seeking
--
seeking
certification,
if
they
thought
that
was
consistent
with
due
process,
certainly
they
could
have
considered
adopting
that
as
part
of
cafa.
but
they
chose
to
deal
with
it
in
a
very
different
way,
a
very
different
manner,
and
that
was
to
go
ahead
and
change
the
jurisdictional
status
and
diversity
cases,
make
minimal
diversity
and
allow
removal
with
certain
--
certain
exceptions
for
certain
discretionary
ones,
stay
at
home
and
local
controversy
exceptions,
but
they
didn't
--
i
mean,
that's
how
they
chose
to
deal
with
it.
now,
certainly
we
would
admit
that
since
cafa
has
been
enacted,
the
chance
--
certainly
there's
not
nearly
as
many
of
these
cases
which
will
occur
where
this
will
be
an
issue,
because
many
large
classes
now
will
get
removed.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
yes,
justice
kagan,
it's
my
understanding
that
that
was
something
they
were
concerned
about.
they
were
concerned
about,
again,
some
states
being
too
permissive
in
granting
class
certifications,
and
they
were
worried
about
some
of
those
same
factors.
but,
you
know,
one
of
the
primary
concerns
on
all
--
in
cafa
itself,
though,
was
protecting
the
absent
class
members'
rights,
and
this
court's
noted
those
same
rights
in
amchem
and
ortiz,
many
of
its
cases,
your
cases,
you've
noted
that
that's
a
principle
concern.
and
this
court
has
heightened
the
standard
in
those
class
--
class
settlement
certifications
for
the
court
to
make
sure
that
each
and
every
element
and
requirement
is
met,
to
ensure
that
--
that
the
settlement
itself
is
fair
to
all
class
members,
including
the
absent
class
members,
and
that,
you
know
--
and
that
the
attorney
fees
are
fair.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
in
all
other
federal
cases,
i
believe
that
that
might
survive
a
due
process
challenge;
because
you're
limiting
it
to
the
same
legal
standard
in
those
cases.
i
--
certainly
i
think
because
it
would
be
applying
those
--
to
absent
class
members
who
were
not
truly
parties,
i
believe
some
of
those
due
process
concerns
could
be
raised.
but
you
certainly
would
not
have
the
elements
of
the
federalism,
you
would
not
have
the
different
legal
standard
that
we
have
with
state
courts
applying
their
own
rules.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
your
honor,
this
court
has
noted
a
procedural
right
to
seek
class
certification.
there
is
no
right
to
have
one.
we
have
to
meet
the
requirements.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
your
honor,
i
--
certainly
would
hope
that
they
would
provide
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
people
to
come
and
make
their
arguments
and
to
argue
both
sides
of
the
question.
but,
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
maybe
thorogood,
the
recent
thorogood
case
out
of
the
seventh
circuit,
might
involve
something
similar
to
that.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
based
on
a
collateral
estoppel
preclusion
principles,
your
honor.
which--
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
--well,
it's
even
somewhat
worse
in
my
opinion,
because
not
only
do
they
have
a
different
party,
but
they
went
from
a
nationwide
class
to
a
statewide
class,
and
that
itself
is
--
you
know,
that's
--
even
bridgestone;
that
would
be
all
right
under.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
yes,
yes,
because
he's
not
the
same
party
--
but
the
legal
standard
would
be
the
same
and
it
would
not
be
a
wise
move.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
in
this
case,
the
mdl
court
did
not
seek
to
bind
any
parties.
the
decision
was
deny
class
certification;
the
decision
was
not
to
bind
any
absent
class
members.
moreover,
in
cases
talking
about
adequate
representation,
such
as
hansberry
v.
lee
and
the
richards
case,
one
of
the
things
this
court
noted
was
that
normally
you
have
a
judgment
that
indicates
who
it
purports
to
bind.
there's
nothing
in
the
district
court's
initial
judgment
indicating
that
the
absent
class
members
are
bound
by
the
denial
of
class
certification,
nothing
whatsoever.
in
devlin
v.
scardelletti
which
they
say
supports
their
position,
clearly
it
supports
our
position,
because
that
was
a
case
dealing
with
a
certified
class
settlement,
where
there
were
objections.
and
because
the
objections
were
made
and
overruled,
this
court
noted
that
those
people
could
appeal
directly
without
having
to
intervene
in
that
case.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
seventh
circuit
for
instance
in
bridgestone,
which
--
which
the
eighth
circuit
relied
on
in
this
case,
indicated
that
adequate
representation
was
one
of
the
factors,
our
right
to
appeal
was
one
of
the
factors,
and
then
our
individual
claims
still
existing,
consisted
sufficient
due
process.
but
one,
we
have
no
notice,
so
how
can
we
appeal
anything
if
we
don't
know
it
exists?
and
this
court
has
noted
that
in
many
cases,
in
mullane
and
richards
and
throughout,
that
if
you
have
no
notice
of
a
matter,
how
can
you
ever
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
because
you
don't
know
about
it?
now,
as
to
adequate
representation,
that
was
something
i
wanted
to
turn
to.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
your
honor,
our
case
was
filed
in
september
2001.
the
mccollins
case
was
filed
in
august
2001,
and
nobody
knew
about
the
other
one
at
all.
i
mean,
these
cases
were
filed
almost
the
same
time,
less
--
less
than
a
month
apart
in
different
counties,
different
attorneys,
different
named
plaintiffs.
i
did
want
to
note
in
devlin
v.
scardelletti,
justice
scalia
noted
his
dissent
that
not
even
petitioners
were
advancing
the
novel
and
surely
erroneous
argument
that
absent
class
members
were
considered
parties
before
class
certification.
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
your
honor,
we've
argued
that
throughout.
we
knew
nothing
about
it.
and
see,
the
mdl
proceeding,
we
had
like
one
or
two
cases
that
were
filed,
individual
actions
where
the
plaintiffs
did
not
want
to
seek
class
action
status,
and
those
got
removed
to
federal
court
and
transferred.
the
mdl
court
provides
notice
of
the
orders
affecting
all
cases
in
general
and
then
provides
you
with
orders
in
your
own
case.
you
do
not
get
orders
about
other
individual
cases.
so
we
never
knew
about
mccollins
and
then
proceeded
to
class
certification.
i
would
note
that
the
white
case
here
in
no
--
no
way
vindicates
the
district
court.
the
white
case
did
say
that
reliance
did
not
have
to
be
proven
if
you
have
fraudulent
concealment
or
suppression.
rather,
the
standard
is
all
you
have
to
do
is
you
have
to
show
would
an
objectively
reasonable
person
have
bought
the
product
had
they
known
all
the
information
that
was
concealed
and
suppressed;
and
clearly
that
can
be
dealt
with
on
a
common
basis.
but
a
confusing
aspect
here,
it
seems
like
many
people
try
to
argue
that
for
class
actions
that
you
have
to
have
all
common
issues
or
else
you
can't
have
one;
and
that's
unfortunate
because
i'm
not
aware
of
any
class
action
where
you
don't
have--
mr.
richard
a.
monahan
--yes,
they
added
--
they
added
a
syllabus
point
6,
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion,
a
paragraph
that
says
that
from
now
on
that
--
that
prescription
drug
purchasers
cannot
have
such
a
claim;
and
that
was
unknown
to
anybody,
it
was
not
raised
in
part
of
the
certified
question
and
had
not
been
litigated
or
argued.
so
that's
part
of
the
petition
for
rehearing
is
my
understanding.
