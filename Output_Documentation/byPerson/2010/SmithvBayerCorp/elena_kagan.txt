justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
monahan,
do
you
mean
by
that
that
you
would
have
a
blanket
rule
that
a
decision
on
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
23
can
never
be
preclusive
as
to
a
state
rule
of
civil
procedure
23?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
suppose
the
state
says:
we
will
not
consider
ourselves
bound;
we
do
have
our
own
law
with
respect
to
rule
23,
but
sometimes
we'll
go
along
with
the
federal
rule
and
sometimes
we
won't.
is
it
then
up
to
the
courts
to
actually
try
to
determine
whether
the
--
the
west
virginia
court
in
this
case
would
have
gone
along,
would
have
interpreted
its
own
rule
of
civil
procedure
the
same
way
that
the
federal
court
interpreted
the
federal
rule?
justice
elena
kagan
when
--
when
congress
enacted
cafa,
did
congress
think
about
this
precise
issue,
the
issue
that
justice
ginsburg
is
raising
about
a
lawyer
going
from
state
to
state
with
a
different
named
plaintiff?
was
that
--
was
that
part
of
what
congress
was
reacting
to?
justice
elena
kagan
when
you
said
on
that
issue,
mr.
beck,
on
what
issue,
because
i
think
that
there
is
an
argument
in
this
case
that
the
west
virginia
approach
to
class
certification
is
different
from
the
eighth
circuit's
approach,
that
rezulin
would
not
have
been
the
way
that
the
eighth
circuit
would
have
approached
the
class
certification
question.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
beck,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
white
answers
the
question
that
i
asked,
because
white
decided
a
matter
of
substantive
liability,
and
the
question
i
asked
was
whether
the
approach
to
class
certification
was
different
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
in
west
virginia.
justice
elena
kagan
if
you
look
at
rezulin,
if
you
compare
to
it
some
eighth
circuit
cases,
there
seems
to
be
a
difference
in
at
least
tone,
shall
we
say,
about
the
extent
to
which
a
finding
is
required
that
common
issues
predominate.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
beck,
the
relitigation
exception
of
the
anti-injunction
act
speaks
in
terms
of
judgments.
why
is
the
denial
of
class
certification
a
judgment?
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
judgment,
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
there
was
just
a
contemporaneous
summary
judgment
motion,
and
the
court
granted
summary
judgment
as
well.
but
the
denial
of
class
certification
isn't
responsible
for
the
judge's
dismissal
of
the
suit.
justice
elena
kagan
so
that
sounds
like
a
very
contingent
answer
to
my
question.
if
that
were
not
the
case,
if
it
--
if
there
was
the
denial
of
a
class
certification,
but
then
the
action
proceeds
as
a
non-class
litigation,
you
think
that
there
would
be
no
judgment,
and
so
the
anti-injunction
act
would
not
apply?
justice
elena
kagan
oh,
but
why
isn't
it
really,
because
here
what
happened
was
that
there
was
a
denial
of
class
certification
and
there
was
a
granting
of
a
summary
judgment
motion
at
one
and
the
same
time?
but
the
thing
that
was
responsible
for
getting
the
case
out
of
court
was
the
granting
of
the
summary
judgment
motion,
not
the
denial
of
class
certification.
that
was
extraneous
to
the
judgment
that
the
case
was
dismissed.
justice
elena
kagan
this
is
a
very
complicated
procedural
case.
so
if
you
understand
anything
that
i
say
right
now,
you
have
a
law
degree
and
you've
had
your
cups
of
coffee
this
morning.
in
this
case,
a
federal
court
ordered
a
west
virginia
state
court
not
to
rule
on
a
motion
to
certify
a
class
action.
the
federal
judge
thought
that
he
could
issue
that
order
because
he
had
refused
to
certify
a
class
action
in
a
similar
case
that
was
brought
against
the
same
defendant
but
by
a
different
plaintiff.
we
took
this
case
to
decide
whether
the
federal
judge's
order
was
permissible
under
the
anti-injunction
act,
a
federal
statute
that
generally
prohibits
federal
courts
from
interfering
with
state
court
proceedings.
we
hold
that
it
was
not
permissible.
as
the
anti-injunction
act's
name
suggests,
its
purpose
is
to
prevent
federal
court
injunctions
against
state
court
proceedings
otherwise
it
might
be
called
the
pro-injunction
act.
but
the
act
stand
on
these
injunctions
is
not
absolute.
the
act
contains
three
narrow
exceptions.
and
the
one
at
issue
here
is
called
the
relitigation
exception.
what
it
does
is
to
say
that
a
federal
court
may
grant
an
injunction
to
stay
proceedings
in
a
state
court
when
necessary
to
protect
or
effectuate
the
federal
court's
judgment.
this
exception
we've
held
is
grounded
in
the
law
of
preclusion
which
generally
determines
whether
one
court's
judgment
forecloses
another
court
from
considering
issues
or
claims
already
adjudicated
in
the
first
suit.
an
injunction
under
the
relitigation
exception
is
justified
only
when
the
initial
federal
judgment
clearly
precludes
relitigation
of
a
given
issue
or
claim
in
state
courts
under
standard
principles
of
preclusion
law.
the
two
fundamental
principles
of
preclusion
law
are
at
stake
in
this
case.
first
is
the
rule
that
a
judgment
cannot
preclude
relitigation
of
an
issue
in
a
second
suit
unless
the
two
courts
here,
the
federal
court
and
the
state
court
are
addressing
the
very
same
issue.
under
the
law
of
issue
preclusion,
two
courts
do
not
address
the
same
issue
unless
they
are
using
the
same
legal
standard.
and
here
that
requirement
was
not
met
because
in
determining
whether
to
certify
these
class
actions,
the
federal
court
and
the
state
court
were
governed
by
different
legal
standards.
in
federal
court,
the
question
was
controlled
by
a
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
23.
while
on
state
court,
the
question
is
governed
by
west
virginia
rule
of
civil
procedure
23.
and
although
the
texts
of
these
two
rules
are
mostly
the
same,
the
governing
judicial
interpretations
are
not.
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
has
made
clear
that
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
federal
class
certification
precedents
and
in
its
leading
case,
it
adopted
an
approach
markedly
different
from
the
approach
applied
by
the
federal
court.
because
the
governing
legal
standards
were
different,
the
issues
before
the
two
courts
were
also
different.
and
that
means
the
federal
court
had
no
right
to
order
the
state
court
to
accept
its
judgment
that
a
class
action
should
not
be
certified.
the
district
court's
injunction
also
violated
a
separate
rule
of
preclusion
law
what
we
called
"the
rule
against
nonparty
preclusion".
this
means
that
a
person
who
was
not
a
party
to
a
case
cannot
be
bound
by
a
judgment
in
that
case
except
in
very
limited
and
precisely
defined
circumstances.
and
here
the
plaintiff
in
the
state
suit
was
not
a
party
and
the
federal
suit
he
in
fact
had
no
connection
to
that
suit.
and
none
of
the
exceptions
to
the
rule
against
nonparty
preclusion
apply.
the
only
exception
we
were
asked
to
consider
is
one
from
members
of
a
properly
conducted
class
action.
but
that
exception
does
not
apply
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
federal
court
in
this
case
never
certified
a
class.
to
the
contrary,
it
found
that
the
case
was
not
appropriate
for
class
treatment.
and
the
properly
conducted
class
action
exception
cannot
be
invoked
when
there
was
no
certified
class
action.
so
for
this
reason
too,
the
district
court
was
wrong
to
enjoin
the
state
court
proceedings.
because
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
conjunction,
we
must
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.

thomas

and

the
opinion.
