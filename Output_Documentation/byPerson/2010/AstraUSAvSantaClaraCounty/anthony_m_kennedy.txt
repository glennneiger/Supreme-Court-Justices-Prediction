before
the
statute
was
amended
by
the
--
i
think
the
patient
protection
act
and
there
was
a
breach
of
the
agreement,
did
the
government
assess
penalties?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
--
and
the
reason
i'm
asking
this
is
that
you
indicate
that
the
government
had
a
contract
remedy.
it
seemed
to
me
it
had
a
regulatory
remedy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
the
contract
remedy
that
it
had
at
the
time
this
case
arose,
which
was
before
the
--
these--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
don't
understand
why
what
justice
scalia
said
isn't
the
same
as
what
you
said.
you
said
no,
justice
scalia,
a
restatement
of
contract.
but
what
he
said,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
did
the
parties
intend,
and
it
is
an
objective
intent,
to
confer
these
rights
on
a
third
person.
and
--
and
you
said
no,
no,
that's
not
it.
but
then
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
that
you
gave
was
just
what
justice
scalia
said.
i
--
i
missed
something.
