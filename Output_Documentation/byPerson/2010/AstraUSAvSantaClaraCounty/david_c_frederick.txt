mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
start
with
ms.
blatt's
answer
to
your
question
about
whether
a
provision
of
the
agreement
here
could
confer
third-party
beneficiary
rights.
she
said
yes,
so
long
as
the
wording
wasn't
specifically
prescribed
by
congress.
in
so
doing,
she
concedes
that
this
is
a
contract,
that
normal
rules
of
contract
law
apply,
that
the
fact
that
the
secretary
has
entered
into
the
contract
is
of
no
moment,
and
that
third-party
beneficiary
rights
are
an
inherent
part
of
normal
contract
principles.
so
now
we're
left
with
the
question,
does
it
matter
that
congress
wrote
the
particular
words
that
the
secretary
used
in
the
agreement?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
submit
that
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
scalia,
you
find
the
intent
in
part
2a
of
the
agreement
which
is
set
forth
in
the
petition
appendix.
and
in
part
2a,
the
manufacturer
who
agrees
voluntarily
to
enter
into
this
agreement
agrees
that
the
entity
--
that
the
entity
will
be
charged
only
a
set
ceiling
price.
that
is
a
voluntary
agreement
of
a
duty
by
the
manufacturer
that
runs
to
the
third-party
beneficiary
covered
entities
--
in
the
agreement.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
that's
not
the
standard,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
standard
for
a
third-party
beneficiary
as
set
forth
in
the
restatement
and
as
recognized
by
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
parties
objectively
intended
to
create
intended
third-party
beneficiaries
whose
right
to
bring
the
suit
would
enforce
the
contract,
and
that's
precisely
what
we
have
here.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
340b
entities.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
government
cannot
argue
for
subjective
intent
of
an
agreement
written
18
years
ago.
this
court's
decisions
in
contract
have
always
held
that
the
objective
intent
as
expressed
by
the
words
of
the
contract
are
what
courts
are
to
construe.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
okay.
here's
what
i
think
i
misunderstood
perhaps
from
justice
scalia's
question.
for
third-party
beneficiary
rights
to
create
an
enforceable
breach
of
contract
claim,
the
parties
to
the
contract
do
not
have
to
have
a
provision
in
the
contract
saying
"and
therefore
the
intended
third
parties
get
to
bring
a
breach
of
contract
claim.
"
that's
never
been
the
accepted
law.
the
law
has
always
said
if
the
parties
intend
to
create
third-party
beneficiaries
and
bringing
of
that
suit
to
enforce
the
contract
would
be
within
the
objective
intent
of
the
parties,
such
a
suit
is
permissible.
now,
i
want
to
caution
that
what
is
different
about
this
suit
from
the
kinds
of
implied
rights
of
action
suits
that
the
drug
companies
here
claim
to
be
so
disruptive,
is
that
all
we're
arguing
for
is
the
bargain
that
the
manufacturers
agreed
to
undertake.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
bargain
was
the
discount.
it
is
the
delta
between
what
the
counties
paid
and
what
they
should
have
paid
under
the
discount
program
ceiling
price
arrangement
in
the
plain
terms
of
the
agreement.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
indirectly
here,
justice
alito,
that
the
patients
here
certainly
are
incidental
beneficiaries,
insofar
as
those
who
can't
afford
to
pay
for
the
drugs
get
them
for
free
at
the
county's
expense.
this
is
county
money
that
we're
talking
about
here.
or
if
they
have
some
limited
insurance,
they're
able
to
get
the
drugs
at
a
discount.
so
they
are
certainly
incidental
beneficiaries,
but
because
they're
not
named
and
because
the
intent
of
the
program
is
to
provide
the
340b
entities
with
discounted
drugs
so
they
can
extend
scarce
dollars
farther,
they
have
no
right
to
sue.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
our
argument
rests
on
the
silence
of
contract
with
respect
to
how
enforcement
would
concur.
it
has
long
been
the
case,
though,
that
where
the
parties
intend
to
displace
a
third-party
beneficiary's
rights,
the
objective
intent
of
the
--
of
the
agreement
is
what
is
--
understood.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
is
how
the
restatement
frames
it.
it's
a
--
it
is
a
difficult
line
i
think
sometimes
to
understand
the
difference
between
an
intended
beneficiary
and
an
incidental
beneficiary.
certainly
the
manufacturers
here
are
incidental
beneficiaries--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
they
have
access
to
this
market.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
that
is
the
key,
justice
sotomayor.
the
price
discount
is
where
all
the
action
is
in
this
program.
these
prices,
between
1990
and
1992,
were
being
raised
by
the
drug
manufacturers
as
against
these
entities,
and
the
whole
point
of
congress
enacting
this
statute
was
to
confer
the
same
discounted
drug
program
to
the
covered
entities
as
had
been
done
through
contracts
to
the
state
medicaid
rebate
program.
and
that's
why
the
provision
in
the
amendment
--
sorry,
in
the
agreement
that
says,
thou
shall
not
charge
the
covered
entities
more
than
the
ceiling
price,
is
exactly
where
you
find
the
intended
third-party
beneficiary
rights,
because
that's
their
money
that's
being
spent.
it's
not
federal--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--number
one,
there's
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
there
to
be
a
departure
from
normal
operating
contract
principles,
and
this
court,
in
winstar,
in
mobil
oil,
in
jackson
transit,
in
central
airlines,
all
said
that
when
congress
uses
contracts
or
agreements,
it
intends
to
incorporate
the
full
cluster
of
the
common
law
rights
as
they've
existed.
and
third-party
beneficiary
rights
have
been
recognized
for
350
years,
even
before
the
founding
of
this
republic.
now,
as
to
the
disruption,
i
think
it
is
a
canard,
because
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
one
price
that
would
govern
all
14,500
covered
entities.
so
if
santa
clara
gets
the
discount
price
for
lipitor,
say,
that
is
the
best
price,
and
it
will
be
charged
and
chargeable
to
all
of
the
340b
entities
across
the
nation.
so
in
terms
of
administrability,
one
suit
actually
can
solve
the
deficiencies
in
the
government
enforcement
program,
and
the
government
can
participate
in
this
suit.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
i
think
it
is
an
argument
that
may
misunderstand
some
of
the
benefits
that
class
action
practice
can
provide,
where
there
is
a
uniform
way
of
analyzing
the
problem,
because
these
prices,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
it
doesn't.
this
was
brought
as
one
for
the
efficiency
purpose
of
obtaining
exactly
the
effect
that
you
are
identifying,
which
is
that
if
it
is
more
efficient--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
it
was
brought
as
a
class
action
because
the
county
of
santa
clara
stands
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
other
57
counties
of
california
and
the
other
counties
in
the
united
states
who
are
overpaying
for
drugs
that
the
manufacturers
are--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
don't
know
that
the
state,
because
these
are
entities
that
are
not
defined
in
the
agreement
--
this
is
a
different
agreement
than
under
the
medicaid
rebate
agreement,
which
is
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
states
are
the
third-party
beneficiaries
of
those
agreements.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
state
actually
has
standing
to
bring
these
particular
claims.
that
is
not
something
that
has
been
tested.
but
what
i
would
say
is
that
if
you
reject
our
argument
here,
you
are
substantially
undercutting
the
ability
of
the
states
to
bring
the
same
kinds
of
overcharging
claims
against
drug
manufacturers
under
the
medicaid
rebate
program.
that's
what
the
state's
amicus
brief
here
makes
clear.
the
sg
has
a
very
fuzzy
footnote
at
the
very
end
of
the
government's
brief
that
does
not
set
forth
a
clear
standard
that
differentiates
why
340b
entities'
third-party
beneficiary
rights
are
any
different
from
states'
rights
under
the
medicaid
rebate
program.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
that
was
the
basis
for
judge
saris's
opinion
in
the
district
of
massachusetts,
which
looked
at
the
third-party
beneficiary
theory
of
the
states
in
giving
them
a
place
at
the
table
and
bringing
these
kinds
of
claims.
and
to
the
extent
that
that
analysis
bears
out
anything,
it's
--
tends
to
cast
doubt
on
the
government's
theory
that
these
are
somehow
regulatory
contracts
that
suggest
a
blurring
of
the
normal
lines
between
regulation
and
contract.
that
theory,
the
regulatory
contract
theory,
has
been
rejected
by
this
court
in
winstar
and
in
mobil
oil,
where
the
government
tried
to
argue
that
because
it
was
implementing
regulatory
policy
through
contracts,
somehow
normal
contract
principles
don't
apply,
and
this
court
rejected--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
and
that
is
why
resort
to
the
normal
canons
of
construction
that
this
court
has
long
applied
to
government
contracts
is
what
is
most
pertinent
here.
the
government,
i
don't
think,
can
point
to
a
specific
provision
of
the
cooperative
federalism
that
empowers
states
to
engage
in
any
greater
enforcement
power
than
a
normal
third-party
beneficiary
under
this
court's
normal
cases.
in
fact,
back
to
central
airlines
and
american
surety,
which,
a
hundred
years
ago,
recognized
a
third-party
beneficiary's
right
to
bring
suit
on
a
breach
of
contract
and
held
that
the
absence
of
a
specific
enforcement
power
in
the
statute
was
not
enough
to
deny
the
normal
operation
of
law
for
the
breached
party
to
sue
for
that
breach.
that's
common
in
the
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
if
you
took
that
argument
to
its
logical
extreme,
you
would
have
come
to
a
different
answer
in
the
arthur
andersen
case,
where
there,
you
recognized
a
third-party
beneficiary's
right
to
invoke
a
statute
to
get
an
arbitration
agreement
upheld.
and
i
think
you
would
have
come
to
a
different
result
in
the
miree
v.
dekalb
county
case
in
which
the
court
said
that
just
because
there
is
a
faa
contract
with
a
local
airport
authority
does
not
deny
a
third-party
beneficiary
rights
to
sue
if
there
is
an
adverse
affect
on
adjoining
land
because
you
would
have
said
that
because
the
adjoining
land
owner
had
no
specific
enforcement
authority,
that
person
or
entity
would
be
out
of
luck.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
let
me
address
that
directly,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
justice
rehnquist,
who
was
not
any
fan
of
implied
rights
of
action,
was
the
author
for
the
court's
opinion
in
the
miree
decision.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we're
not
asking
you
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action,
mr.
chief
justice.
we're
asking
you
to
honor
contract
principles
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--a
contract
is
a
voluntary
agreement
entered
into
between
the
drug
manufacturer
and
the
secretary.
the
manufacturer
can
choose
not
to
participate.
so
in
every
one
of
the
implied
right
of
action
cases
that
you
dealt
with,
an
outside
entity
has
been
forced
to
comply
with
a
statute
or
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
ginsburg,
those
cases
all
involve
the
imposition
of
duties
on
the
part
of
an
entity
or
actor
out
in
society.
here
we're
talking
about
voluntary
action.
the
drug
manufacturers
can
decide
not
to
participate
and
not
sign
the
agreement.
and
they
have
the
right
under
the
provisions
allowing
termination
to
terminate
the
agreement
at
will
with
no
reason
whatsoever.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
the
remedy
is
different,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
that
is
a
key
difference.
all
we're
talking
about
here
as
a
remedy
is
the
difference
between
what
they
promised
to
charge
and
what
they
actually
charged.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
there
are
two
ways
to
calculate
it.
under
the
more
complicated
formula
that
is
designed
to
enhance
the
profits
of
the
drug
companies,
it
is
a
more
complicated
endeavor.
all
of
those
cases,
justice
ginsburg,
all
of
them,
have
been
with
the
simple
formula,
which
is
has
the
drug
company
given
its
best
price
to
some
other
purchaser
in
the
market.
that's
where
the
false
claims
act
cases
that
they
acknowledge
do
not
create
such
an
intrusion
into
the
program--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
no,
the
difference
in
a
qui
tam
case,
as
your
question
earlier
to
my
colleague
earlier
acknowledged,
justice
ginsburg,
is
the
government
doesn't
have
to
intervene
in
a
false
claims
act
case.
what's
different
there
is
that
there
has
to
be
some
inside
whistleblower
who
can
pass
through
the
very
difficult
hurdles
of
a
false
claims
act
case;
whereas
here
we
are
talking
about
benefit
of
the
bargain.
the
manufacturers
agreed
by
contract
they
were
only
going
to
charge
a
ceiling
price,
and
we
assert
based
on
--
you
know
--
quite
extensive
reports
by
officers
of
inspector
general
that
they
have
not
been
charging
that
price.
they've
been
charging
in
excess
of
that
price,
and
all
we
are
asking
for
is
the
delta.
and
the
government
in
its
massachusetts
submissions
has
acknowledged
that
this
type
of
best
price
litigation
is
not
so
complicated
because
all
one
needs
to
do
is
figure
out
did
the
drug
companies
sell
the
particular
drug
to
some
other
entity
for
a
lower
price;
and
if
that's
so,
that's
the
price
you
apply
across
the
board
to
all
the
340b
entities.
the
argument
about
distraction
and
intrusion,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
respectfully
submit
is
a
gross
overstatement
of
what
actually
happens
in
this
type
of
litigation.
and
to
the
extent
that
there
are
complexities,
the
complexities
are
introduced
by
the
drug
companies
for
the
sole
purpose
of
masking
what
price
they
are
charging
to
the
340b
entities.
because
all
these
various
mechanisms,
the
bundling
of
drugs,
the
use
of
kickbacks
and
payments
to
purchasers,
are
all
designed
to
mask
what
the
true
price
of
the
drug
is.
and
if
congress
intended
anything
in
the
program,
and
in
getting
the
secretary
to
implement
this
program
through
statutes,
it
was
that
the
340b
entities
who
are
providing
drugs
and
medical
service
to
the
poorest
of
our
citizens
should
be
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
collective
market
created
by
these
340b
drug
purchases.
and
that's
all
that
we're
asking
for
here.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
don't
know,
justice
ginsburg,
is
the
simple
and
plainest
answer
i
can
give
you.
and
the
reason
we
don't
know
is
because
the
secretary
has
already
missed
the
first
statutory
deadline
for
issuing
implementing
regulations.
there
was
no
statement
of
rules
in
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking,
as
is
ordinarily
the
case
for
agencies.
the
secretary
simply
put
out
for
comment
that
we
are
going
to
develop
procedures
and
rules.
so
we
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
secretary
will
express
some
further
intent
as
to
how
these
new
rules
are
to
apply.
but
i
would
submit
that
this
court's
cases
are
very
clear,
that
a
later
enactment
of
congress
is
not
intent
of
what
an
earlier
congress
has
stated;
and
the
absence
of
any
specific
remedial
provision
coupled
with
the
use
of
agreements
carries
with
it
the
ordinary
presumption
that
congress
intended
for
that
cluster
of
common
law
rights
to
be
associated
with
the
agreement.
and
that's
certainly
been
the
way
this
court
has
enforced
contracts
involving
the
government
itself.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we'll
submit.
