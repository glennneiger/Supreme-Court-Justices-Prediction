justice
samuel

alito,

well,
how
do
we
distinguish
between
what
you
call
an
ordinary
contract
and
this
sort
of
a
contract,
if
it
is
any
kind
of
contract?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
tell
us
whether
you
agree
with
the
petitioner's
argument
in
part
d
of
its
brief
that
private
suits
would
seriously
disrupt
the
comprehensive
statutory
scheme,
in
light
of
the
position
that
the
government
has
taken
in
other
litigation
involving
actions
brought
by
states,
in
re
pharmaceutical
industry
average
wholesale
price
litigation
in
the
district
of
massachusetts?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
there
be--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
could
there
be--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--could
there
be
a
third-party
--
a
suit
by
an
intended
beneficiary
and
a
purported
intended
beneficiary,
if
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
to
the
extent
it
can
intend
something
for
those
beneficiaries
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
price,
but
did
not
intend
for
them
to
be
able
to
sue?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
there
were--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
there
were
a
provision
in
the
law
saying
expressly
there
is
no
private
right
of
action
under
this
statute,
would
you
be
able
to
make
the
same
argument?
