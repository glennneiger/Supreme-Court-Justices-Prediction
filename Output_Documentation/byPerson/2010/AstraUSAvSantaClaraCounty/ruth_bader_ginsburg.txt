ms.
blatt,
would
you
explain
the
function
that
the
contract
mechanism
serves?
i
mean,
you
could
just
have
the
--
just
have
the
statute
say,
thou
shalt
not
charge
more
than
the
ceiling
price,
period.
what
if
--
what
is
accomplished
by
having
the
contract
reflecting
the
terms
of
the
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
to
the
extent
that
you're
objecting
to
the
disruption
of
the
secretary,
there
is
disruption
when
it's
a
private
party
bringing
a
false
claims
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
if
the
united
states
doesn't
take
over
the
case,
this
works
to
keep
them
related?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mean
there's
no
negotiated
element
to
it?
it's
what
the
--
it
is
the
same
as
ms.
blatt
said?
the
contract
repeats
the
words,
the
terms
of
the
statute,
and
that's
it?
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
blatt
said
nothing
has
been
done.
it
just
went
into
effect
in
january
1,
right?
but
are
there
--
are
there
plans
to
implement
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
i
thought
when
this
case
went
back
to
the
--
to
the
district
court
the
--
the
agency's
position
was,
this
is
a
total
surprise
to
us,
14,000
suits
or
whatever
it
is.
no,
we
never
--
we
never
envisioned
making
the
individual
whatever
you
call
them
--
the
430
b--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
never
envisioned
making
them
beneficiaries
and
--
and
allowing
them
to
sue.
that
would
be
quite
disruptive
of
our
program.
that,
i
thought
was
the
position
the
government
took.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
was
because
the
states
have
been
given
a
role
in
the
statute
itself,
where
the
340b
entities
have
not.
i
thought
that
was
the
--
the
government's
position,
that
the
states
have
a
role
in
the
medicaid
program
and
that's
an
entirely
different
thing
than
this
program,
where
these
entities
have
no
statutory
role,
says
the
drug
manufacturers
and
then
this
--
hhs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
result
is
the
same,
mr.
frederick.
and
that's
the
central
point
since
last
brief,
and
call
it
whatever
you
want,
it's
--
congress
has
not
provided
for
a
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
statute.
the
contract
embodies
the
terms
of
the
statute.
so
it
would
be
passing
strange
if
congress,
as
we
now
read
congress,
says
we
want
private
parties
out
of
this,
this
is
to
be
between
the
agency
and
the
manufacturer
to
say.
the
same
exact
result.
the
same
aim
can
be
achieved
through
this
third-party
beneficiary
route.
and
i
think
that
said,
that
is
what
stands
out
about
this
case.
so
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
what's
the
difference
between
suing
because
the
statute
has
been
violated
and
suing
because
the
contract
has
been
violated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
statute
wouldn't
apply
to
someone
who
doesn't
want
to
be
in
the
program.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whatever
you're
saying,
that's
all
we're
talking
about,
we
are
told
that
computing
the
price
is
a
very
intricate
business.
and
many
of
these
disputes
have
been
about
what
is
--
what
should
the
ceiling
price
be.
the
ceiling
price
is
out
there,
there
is
no
dispute
about
it.
it
is
just
a
question
of
getting
the
manufacturers
to
charge
that
price
and
not
a
higher
price.
the
question
is
what
is
the
ceiling
price?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--control
over
them.
and
they
don't
have
control
over
these
suits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
take
the
position
that
nothing
has
changed
as
a
result
of
the
new
legislation,
that
is,
ms.
anders
told
us
that
this
statute
told
us
that
this
statute's
going
--
to
become
effective,
there's
going
to
be
procedures,
better
procedures
than
there
were
before.
is
it
still
this
third-party
beneficiary
suit,
despite
the
possibility
of
going
to
the
agency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
section
340b
of
the
public
health
services
act
places
ceilings
on
the
prices
drug
manufacturers
may
charge
for
medications
sold
to
facilities
called
340b
entities,
namely
public
hospitals,
and
community
health
centers
that
provides
services
to
the
poor.
a
manufacturer
opts
into
the
ceiling
price
program
by
signing
a
form
contract
composed
by
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
(hhs),
called
the
pharmaceutical
pricing
agreement
or
ppa.
the
question
presented,
may
a
340b
entity,
although
not
of
colleague
to
the
manufacturer,
hhs
contract.
nevertheless,
it
sued
to
enforce
ppa-prescribed
ceiling
prices.
on
behalf
of
a
class
comprising
340b
entities
in
california
and
the
counties
that
fund
them,
santa
clara
county
sued
astra
and
eight
other
drug
manufacturers.
the
county
alleged
that
the
defendant
manufacturers
charged
340b
entities
more
than
the
ppa-permitted
ceiling
prices.
reversing
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
county's
complaint,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
340b
entities
can
sue
to
enforce
the
ppas
as
third
party
beneficiaries.
the
district
court,
in
our
judgment
got
it
right.
third-party
beneficiary
suits
to
enforce
340b
may
not
be
maintained.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
health
care
facilities
have
no
right
of
action
on
the
340b
itself.
the
county
urges
however
that
when
a
contract
is
designed
to
secure
a
benefit
for
a
third
party,
here,
controlled
prices
for
drug
purchases,
the
intended
beneficiary
acquires
a
common
law
right
to
enforce
that
benefit.
the
county's
argument
overlooks
that
ppas
simply
incorporate
statutory
obligations,
and
record
manufacturers'
consent
to
abide
by
them.
containing
no
negotiable
terms,
the
form
agreements
serviced
a
device
by
which
drug
manufacturers
opt
into
the
340b
program.
a
third
party-suit
to
enforce
the
ppa
is
essentially
a
suit
to
enforce
340b
itself.
important
to
our
decision,
the
340b
program
is
tied
to
the
earlier-enacted,
much
larger
medicaid
drug
rebate
program.
to
gain
payment
of
the
medicaid
for
covered
drugs,
a
manufacturer
must
into
--
enter
into
a
form
agreement
with
hhs
undertaking
to
provide
rebates
to
states
on
the
drug
purchases.
the
340b
program
replicates
the
rebate
programs
opt-in
contract
mechanism,
and
the
340b
ceiling
prices
are
derived
from
"average"
and
"best"
prices
and
rebate
rates
calculated
under
the
medicaid
rebate
program.
determining
a
manufacturer's
average
and
best
prices
is
a
complex
enterprise
that
requires
recourse
to
detailed
information
about
the
company's
sales
and
pricing.
that
information
generally,
is
not
available
to
340b
entities,
for
congress
has
prohibited
hhs
from
disclosing
pricing
information
in
a
form
that
could
reveal
for
the
manufacturer
charges
for
drugs
it
produces.
if
congress
meant
to
allow
third-party
beneficiary
suits
by
340b
entities,
it
likely
would
not
have
barred
potential
suitors
from
obtaining
the
very
information
necessary
to
determine
whether
their
asserted
rights
have
been
violated.
moreover,
congress
made
hhs
the
administrator
of
both
the
medicaid
rebate
program
and
the
340b
program.
interest
of
states
under
the
rebate
program
sometimes
conflict
with
the
interest
of
340b
entities.
to
ensure
operation
of
the
two
programs
harmoniously,
and
on
a
uniform
nationwide
basis,
hhs
must
hold
the
control
rein.
for
these
reasons,
developed
more
expansively
in
the
court's
opinion,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
our
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
