justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
blatt,
you
said
that
there's
not
a
whole
lot
of
difference
between
your
position
and
the
government's.
what
is
the
difference
between
your
position
and
the
government's?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
make
much
sense,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
the
manufacturer
promise
in
exchange
for
the
contract?
you
do
need
consideration.
what
did
they
promise
that
they
were
not
already
obliged
to
do
by
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
a
contract
with
the
secretary
or
a
contract
with
the
united
states
executed
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
by
the
secretary.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
in
the
name
of
the
secretary?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait--
justice
antonin
scalia
--third-party
beneficiary
rights
are
part
of
normal
contracts,
but
the
third-party
beneficiary
has
rights
under
--
under
the
normal
contract
only
when
the
parties
intend
him
to
have
rights.
it's
not
that
every
--
every
contract
which
--
which
has
a
benefit
for
some
person
allows
that
person
to
sue.
there
has
to
be
an
intent.
and
i
--
i
have
trouble
finding
that
intent
here,
either
on
the
--
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
--
would
the
secretary
have
had
that
intent
when
--
when
congress
clearly
did
--
did
not
have
the
intent
to
allow
private
individuals
to
sue?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
you
didn't
hear
my
question.
my
question
was
the
mere
fact
there's
a
duty
to
a
third
party
in
the
normal
contract
does
not
give
that
third
party
the
right
to
sue,
only
if
the
contracting
parties
intend
the
third-party
beneficiary
to
have
the
right
to
sue.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
government's
footnote
doesn't
--
doesn't
rely
on
the
contract.
it
says
that
--
and
it
wasn't
purporting
to
say
the
basis
that
the
court
applied
in
the
district
of
massachusetts
case,
but
it
was
explaining
why,
in
the
government's
view,
it
is
a
different
situation.
and
what
it
said
is
it
is
a
different
situation,
not
because
of
a
different
contract,
but
because
in
that
other
situation,
medicaid
--
the
medicaid
rebate
--
medicaid
generally
is,
quote,
"a
cooperative
federal-state
program".
i
mean,
the
point
is
that
the
states
are
explicitly
given
authority
for
enforcement
in
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
here
the
entities
you're
representing
are
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
big
--
a
big
difference,
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
frederick,
is
that
the
states
are
sovereign.
they
can
enforce
their
own
laws.
the
entities
at
issue
here
are
not
sovereigns.
they're
not
enforcing
their
own
laws.
they
are
trying
to
enforce
federal
law.
but
under
the
--
under
the
medicaid
program,
the
states,
using
their
own
fraud
--
fraud
actions,
whatever
else,
had
a
role
to
play.
