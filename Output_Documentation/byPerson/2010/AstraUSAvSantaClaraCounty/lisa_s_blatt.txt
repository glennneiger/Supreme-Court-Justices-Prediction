ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
reasons
why
section
340b
entities
do
not
have
a
cause
of
ation
to
enforce
the
pharmaceutical
pricing
agreement
between
the
secretary
and
manufacturers.
the
first
reason
is
that
this
common
law
breach
of
contract
suit
is
indistinguishable
from
an
implied
right
of
action
to
enforce
the
statute,
a
right
respondent
concedes
it
does
not
have.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
and
the
--
what
is
being
challenged
here
is
the
contractual
term
that
incorporates
in
haec
verba
the
manufacturer's
ceiling
price
obligations
under
the
act,
and
a
third
party
beneficiary's
suit
to
enforce
the
contract
asserts
the
same
right,
seeks
the
same
remedy,
and
causes
all
the
same
disruptions
as
a
right
of
action
to
enforce
the
statute.
and
another
way
of
saying
that
is,
if
the
case
begins
with
the
premise
that
congress
foreclosed
340b
entities
from
bringing
an
implied
right
of
action
through
the
front
door,
congress
did
not
leave
the
back
door
open
to
essentially
the
same
suit.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right.
well,
our
position
is
obviously
that
the
parties
had
no
discretion
to
confer
article
iii
power
on
courts
to
enforce
an
act
of
congress,
and
this
is.
but
the
--
the
basic
answer
is
that
there
has
always
been
a
huge
difference
between
the
settled
rule
that
parties
to
a
statutory
contract
are
enforceable
--
they
have
a
cause
of
action
to
enforce
the
contract,
because
congress
spoke
with
unambiguously
clear
language
that
the
parties
could
sue.
that's
the
way
statutory
contracts
must
work.
they
must
be
enforceable.
but
your
answer,
sort
of
as
a
practical
matter,
what's
the
difference,
is
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
contract,
and
we
do
think
that
the
federal
law
of
contracts
and
contractual
remedies
flow
between
the
parties
to
the
contract.
it
is
a
bilateral
agreement,
it
is
not
a
regulation
and
the
secretary
made
specific
enforceable
promises.
and
there's
obviously
no
even
operation
of
the
statutory
mandate
without
the
contract.
but
the
reverse,
in
terms
of
the
--
the
long-settled
rule
that
parties
must
be
able
to
sue
to
enforce
a
contract,
there's
an
equally
settled
rule
that
beneficiaries
under
a
statute
do
not
have
the
right
to
enforce
it
unless
there's
a
cause
of
action.
now,
the
test
that
i
think
respondent
advocates
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
applied
is
a
test
this
court
has
long
since
discarded,
which
is:
well,
i'm
a
beneficiary,
and
this
is
a
good
idea,
and
this
is
sensible.
even
if
you
don't
buy
our
test
of
you
have
to
imply
the
implied
right
of
action,
these
lawsuits
are
neither
sensible
nor
a
good
idea
and
not
what
congress
intended.
and
here's
why.
and
it
is
basically
the
second
and
third
reasons.
so
no
matter
how
you
come
at
this
case
and
the
lens
through
which
you
look
at
this,
i
think
everyone
should
come
out
to
the
same
place,
which
is
that
neither
congress
nor
the
secretary
nor
the
manufacturers
signed
up
to
what
is
in
essence
--
would
be
over
14,000
lawsuits
against
500
manufacturers
challenging
the
pricing
for
over
35,000
medications
under
medicaid.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no.
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
whole
thrust
of
the
petition
--
and
obviously
the
primary
argument
is
that
this
flouts
the
implied
right
of
action
jurisprudence
and
it
--
it
conflicts
with
congressional
intent
in
all
events.
but
one
of
the
harms
and
just
sort
of
illustrating
how
bad
the
decision
was
is
this
conferred
rights
that
the
parties
never
imagined
and
that
the
secretary
did
not
--
did
not
intend.
but
i
--
i
think
that
in
our
view,
even
if
the
secretary
had
wanted
to,
it
is
not
the
secretary's
decision
nor
was
it
the
manufacturers'
decision
to
go
contract
by
contract
and
say
this
multi-billion
dollar
health
care
program
that
incorporates
another,
even
bigger
multi-billion
dollar
health
care
program,
we're
going
to
turn
this
over
to
federal
enforcement,
when
on
the
face
of
the
statute
reflects
a
deliberate
decision
by
congress
to
withhold--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--private
enforcement
--
to
withhold
a
private
remedy
in
favor
of
340b
entities
and
instead
channel
exclusive
authority
to
the
secretary
to
enforce
it.
and
those
three
specifics,
in
addition
to
the
disruptions,
are
that
congress
gave
manufacturers
but
not
340b
entities
a
private
reimbursement
remedy
and
a
private--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--well,
all
your
medicaid
cases
obviously
under
state
plans,
and
a
lot
of
your
implied
right
of
action
jurisprudence
is
dealing
with
spending
clause
legislation
as
to
state
entities.
but
there
are
a
number,
a
number
--
the
rehabilitation
act,
the
davis-bacon
act,
and
a
fair
number
of
health
care
programs
--
where
the
government
contracts
with
private
parties
as
a
public
welfare
mechanism
to
get
to
what
i
think
are
conceded
are
beneficiaries.
here,
there's
a
number
of
beneficiaries.
it's
not
just
the
340b
entities.
it's
the
patient
population
that's
being
served,
and
obviously,
the
federal
fisc.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
any
different
than
mobil
oil
or
jackson
transit,
where
congress
wants
to
specify
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
the
contract
incorporates
in
haec
verba
the
statutory
terms.
and
if
there's
a
breach
of
that,
there
are
contractual
remedies
that
flow.
but
i
agree
with
you
that
there's
not
a
whole
lot
of
difference
between
our
position
and
the
government,
because
the
government
is
absolutely
correct
that
it
is
in
haec
verba
and
identical,
and
the
statutory
obligation
that
we're
talking
about
that's
incorporated
into
the
contract
is
that
a
certain
ceiling
price
must
be
charged.
but
the
--
the
other
sort
of
practical
function
is
only
manufacturers
who
enter
into
this
contract
are
subject
to
these
price
controls.
so
if
they
--
if
a
pharmaceutical
manufacturer
doesn't
want
to
participate
in
the
program,
they're
not
covered.
and
in
a
typical
regulation
and
i
think
sort
of
general
spending
clause
analysis,
someone
who
accepts
federal
funding
has
considered
sort
of
implicit
consent
to
the
funding
obligations
because
they're
taking
the
money.
but
here's
there's
an
express
manifestation,
both
by
the
secretary
who
signed
the
agreement
and
the
contractors,
the
pharmaceutical
companies
who
signed
the
agreement.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--it
has
got
a
lot
of
remedies.
it
has
--
but
it--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--yes.
they're
--
right.
we're
still
--
today
is
no
different
than
yesterday,
because
nothing
has
happened
to
implement
the
2010
health
care
reform
except
that
there
are
now
more
civil
monetary
penalties
than
there
were.
but
the
government
has
statutory
penalties,
civil
monetary
penalties,
the
right
of
audit.
it
can
bring
suits
under
the
false
claims
act
and
can
terminate
both
this
agreement
and
the
medicaid
rebate
agreement.
but
as
a
--
the
government
has
contractual
remedies,
too.
i
mean,
why
congress,
i
think
--
a
sensible
inference
for
why
congress
--
congress
picked
contracts
is
that
this
is
--
this
piggybacks
off
the
medicaid
rebate
program
and
that
uses
contracts.
and
that
instead
--
that
in
turn,
rather,
used
contracts
because
the
states
had
negotiated
rebate
agreements
with
drug
companies
way
before
1990.
and
so
congress
continued
the
contract
feature.
and
then,
since
the
pricing
components
under
this
program
are
the
same
pricing
components
under
the
medicaid
rebate
programs,
both
programs
are
parallel
and
they
both
used
agreement.
one
is
the
medicaid
rebate
agreement.
in
this
case,
it's
the
pharmaceutical--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--well,
the
government
says
a
contract
is
not
a
contract
even
though
it
says
it's
a
contract.
our
position
is
that
it's
a
contract.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
the
government
sees
this,
i
think,
as
just
a
unilateral,
that
the
manufacturers
walked
in
and
said:
we're
here
and
happy
to
be
bound.
but
the
agreement
on
its
face
says:
the
secretary
makes
the
following
agreements;
the
secretary
promises
this.
the
most
important
promise
the
secretary
made
to
manufacturers
is
that
the
secretary
said
that
she
would
not
terminate
the
agreement
without
good
cause,
60
days'
notice,
and
certain
conduct
that
the
manufacturer
did
would
not
constitute
grounds
for
termination.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
the
billions
and
billions
in
price
discounts
they
were
not
obliged
to
do
unless
they
--
they
signed
the
contract.
but
the
contract
goes
through
a
ton
of
manufacturer
responsibilities.
the
manufacturer
--
if
the
secretary
thinks
that
there
is
reimbursement
that's
owed,
the
secretary
can
order
reimbursement,
and
the
manufacturer
has
--
it's
a
pretty
substantial--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--well,
the
way
they
have
been
getting
the
money,
and
for
better
or
worse
until
2010,
they
have
been
at
the
mercy
of
the
vastly
larger
medicaid
rebate
program,
which
is
run
on
behalf
of
the
states.
and
because
this
program
is
so
small
compared
to
that
program,
all
the
enforcement
activity,
which
is
all
the
false
claims
act
settlements
that
respondent
cites
in
his
brief,
that
is
how,
as
a
practical
matter,
it's
been
enforced.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
oh,
pick
up
the
phone
and
either
call
the
manufacturer,
the
prime
vendor--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--ultimately,
if
they
can't
get
the
secretary
to--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--if
she's
busy
and
won't
return
the
calls,
congress
said:
you
can't
enforce
it.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
there's
just
--
right
now,
there's
just
an
informal,
non-mandatory--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--because
the
statute
itself
said:
we're
going
to
go
out
of
our
way
to
give
manufacturers
remedies,
make
this
confidential;
manufacturers
have
rights
of
audit,
but
340b
entities
don't.
the
secretary:
here's
a
vast
arsenal
of
things
at
your
disposal,
and
it's
channeled
through
that
regulatory
regime.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
but--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--no.
i
think
30
years
have
said
that
we're
not
going
down
that
road.
i
mean,
in
gonzaga,
there
was
a
breach
of
the
statutory
provision,
and
students
presumably
are
harmed
when
private
information
gets
disclosed.
but
every
private
right
of
action
case
where
you've
said
no,
the
argument
has
been--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--that's
true.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
there's
always
an
apa
action
against
the
secretary--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
bring
an
apa
action.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
and
false
claims
acts
are
brought.
there's
a
lot
of
them
and
there's
a
multitude
of
settlements
that
are
outlined
in
the
briefs.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
it
is
not
a
private
party.
it
is
the
private
party
who
is
assigned
the
claim.
i
mean,
the
case
is
brought
in
the
name
of,
and
it
is
a
case
by
the
united
states.
and
that's
significant
because
the
united
states
has
complete
and
total
control
over
that
case.
here,
the
problem
--
it's
bad
enough--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right.
yes,
that's
right.
it
is
still
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
with
heightened
pleading
requirements,
and
they
actually
have
to
allege
a
knowing
false
statement.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
and
if
there's--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--if
it
is
not
enforced
in
the
statute
--
only
if,
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
plaintiffs
always
lose
under
a
third-party
beneficiary
because
the
bar
is
so
high.
the
government
always
enters
into
contracts
on
behalf
of
somebody,
and
the
government
rarely
intends
to
confer
enforceable
rights,
and
the
parties
rarely
do
it.
but
if
you
had
an
express
provision
outside
the
statute
that
said,
we
intend
to
confer
enforceable
rights
on
third
parties,
and
it
is
not
an
enforcement
of
the
statute
at
all,
then
all
your
jurisprudence
for
determining
congressional
intent
aren't
being
subverted
and
aren't
being
undermined.
i
could
give
you
an
example.
i
mean,
it
could
be
anywhere
from
something
just
completely
outside
the
statute.
together,
the
pharmaceutical
companies
could
say:
we
hereby
agree
to
make
a
contribution
every
year
to
the
clinic
or
hospital
for
a
holiday
gift.
that
would
be
an
odd
contract.
i
don't
see
the
secretary
entering
into
third-party
beneficiary
contracts.
a
much
more
efficient
way
would
just
be
to
contract
with
the
entity
itself.
but
i
think
this
is
just
another
way
of
saying
that
a
lot
of
the
energy
and
breadth
in
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
saved
in
going
through
why
the
common
law
doesn't
confer
it
because
congressional
intent,
by
and
large,
is
going
to
line
up
with
the
secretary
of
the
party's
intent.
but
when
you're
talking
about
in
haec
verba,
and
this
could
not
be
more
precise
because
it
is
the
exact
--
it's
actually
not
even
340b,
the
allegation
is
it
is
a
violation
of
the
medicaid
rebate
act
pricing
reporting
requirements.
it
is
congressional
intent
is
all
that
matters.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
it
is
a
contract
executed
by
hrsa,
the
administrator
of
the
agency
within,
and
he
or
she,
whoever
the
administrator
is
at
the
time,
enters
it
on
behalf
of
the
secretary.
so
it's
in
the
name
of
the
secretary.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
it
is
in
the
pet
app.
starting
at
around
169.
it
says
the
secretary.
you
don't
have
the
signature
page,
but
i've
seen
them.
they're
all
signed
by
the
administrator
of
hrsa,
which
is
the
organization
within
hhs,
not
cms
but
hhs,
that
runs
the
340b
program.
but
if
i
could
--
actually,
i'll
just
save
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
if
i
may
just
talk
about
the
drug
companies,
lipitor,
and
the
common
law;
and
if
you
want,
i
can
also
talk
about
states.
we
take,
obviously,
deep
umbrage
at
the
suggestion
that
the
drug
companies
are
somehow
against
these
clinics.
any
internet
search
will
show
you
that
the
amount
of
discounts
given
under
this
program
equals
the
amount
of
free
drugs
that
are
given
to
these
same
clinics.
and
i'd
also,
probably
a
better
response
is
you
can
look
at
any
rebate
release
issued
by
the
secretary
of
hhs
or
any
page
of
their
cfr,
and
if
you
think
it's
simple,
i
would
be
shocked.
on
lipitor,
it
is
not
the
case
that
the
central
district
of
california
decides
nationwide
what
the
price
of
lipitor
is.
the
--
under
the
other
side's
view,
the
southern
district
of
texas,
the
northern
district
of
new
york,
and
the
district
in
alabama
would
all
decide.
and
what's
really
bad
--
it
is
bad
enough
to
have
14,000
suits
over
35,000
drugs;
but
what
he's
talking
about,
best
price,
and
average
manufactured
price
that
determines
the
states'
rebate
programs
because
the
rebate
program
is
a
rebate,
and
the
ceiling
price
program
is
a
ceiling
price.
when
one
of
the
pricing
components
goes
up,
such
as
average
manufacture
price,
the
states
benefit.
they
get
more
money.
but
generally,
340b
entities,
their
ceiling
price
goes
up.
so
what's
good
for
the
340b
company
--
entity
is
bad
for
the
states.
and
that's
not
disputed.
he
just
says
it
is
