mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
pharmaceutical
pricing
agreement
should
not
be
construed
to
permit
340b
entities
to
bring
suit
to
enforce
drug
manufacturers
price
reporting
requirements
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
ppa
is
not
an
ordinary
contract
and
it
does
not
transform
the
340b
program
from
a
regulatory
scheme
into
a
contractual
one.
like
a
medicare
provider--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--it
is
not
an
ordinary
contract
in
that
it
doesn't
give
rise
to
contract
rights
in
the
--
in
the
regulated
entities.
this
is
very
similar
to
medicare
provider
agreements,
in
which
a
health
care
provider
who
wants
to
enter
into
the
medicare
program
and
provide
services
agrees,
signs
an
agreement
in
which
he
agrees
to
abide
by
the
statutes
and
regulations
set
forth
in
the
medicare
program
and
in
return
for
that
agreement
is
given
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
medicaid
--
in
the
medicare
program.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
i
think
when
the
statute
directs
an
agency
to
enter
into
an
agreement
for
the
sole
purpose
of
memorializing
the
parties'
opt-in
to
the
regulatory
scheme
and
directs
what
the
terms
shall
be,
so
here
provides
statutorily
what
the
reporting
requirements
will
be,
that's
when
the
contract
is
simply
a
regulatory
mechanism.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
it
would
be
a
difficult
question.
i
think
it
would
be
a
difficult
argument
to
say
that
the
secretary
was
completely
without
authority.
i
think
what
has
happened
here
is
the
secretary
has
reasonably
interpreted
the
statute
in
providing
for
an
agreement
between
the
secretary
and
the
manufacturer
to
simply
mark
the
opt-in.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
that's
exactly
right.
i
think,
to
take
the
first
part
of
your
question,
i
think
the
court
can
tell
when
this
is
a
regulatory
contract
when
the
statute
itself
simply
directs
the
agency
to
enter
into
an
agreement
that
--
that
contains
the
terms
that
are
set
forth
in
the
statute.
and
when
you
look
at
the
statutory
scheme
as
a
whole,
it
is
a
regulatory
scheme.
the
government
is
not
acting
as
a
contracting
party
here.
it
is
acting
as
a
regulator.
it
has
the
authority
to
impose
administrative
penalties
which
would
be
reviewed
under
the
apa.
there's
no
transaction
that's
taking
place
with
the
government.
the
only
rules
governing
the
conduct
are
statutory.
so
that's
why
we
think
you
can
tell
that
this
is
not
an
ordinary
contract.
it's
a
regulatory
one.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
that's
right.
this
isn't
a
negotiated
agreement.
this
is
the
secretary
has
simply
repeated
the
terms
of
the
statute
in
the
agreement.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
that
would
be
one
way
to
do
it,
yes.
throughout
this
area,
though,
congress
has
often
used
agreements
to
mark
entry
into
the
regulatory
scheme,
including
in
the
medicare
provider
area,
where
you
do
have
these
agreements
with
health
care
providers.
but
it
would
be
very
odd
then
to
say
that
the
entire
area
is
regulated
by
breach
of
contract
law
rather
than
by
the
hundreds
of
pages
of
regulations
and
statutory
provisions
that
govern
the
providers
rights
there.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
we
do
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
permitting
third-party
beneficiary
suits
here,
if
you
construe
this
as
a
contract,
would
interfere
with
the
government's
ability
to
administer
the
statutory
scheme.
this
is
a
national
pricing
scheme
that's
put
together
by
the
medicaid
rebate
act,
which
has
--
which
is
heavily
regulated.
allowing
14,000
covered
entities
to
bring
individual
suits
in
different
courts
without
hhs
consultation,
without
the
benefit
of
the
government's
input,
could
lead
to
substantial
dis-uniformity
despite
the
fact
that
these
are
supposed
to
be
national
prices.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
no.
that's
actually
an
important
point.
i
think
in
the
medicaid
context
the
states
have
a
cooperative
relationship
with
the
federal
government.
they
receive
some
of
these
funds
directly.
they
have
--
in
fact,
in
the
medicaid
act
it
is
contemplated
that
they
have
their
own
enforcement
responsibilities.
so
when
states
bring
state
law
fraud
suits,
state
law
sca
suits,
they
actually
--
they
consult
intensively
with
hhs.
and
so
in
that
respect
those
suits
represent
the
government's--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--those
are
actually
state
law
suits
that
were
involved
in
the
average
wholesale
price--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
the
medicaid
act
itself
gives
states
an
enforce
responsibility
and
says
that
they
are
to
use
their
efforts
to
find
fraud
and
the
prosecute
it.
and
so
states
actually
have
a
whole
body
of
state
law,
state
law
false
claims
act--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--under
the
medicaid
act
there
would
be--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
we
think
it
is
very
different
when
you
have
covered
entities.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
there's
consultation
with
the
federal
government
at
the
front
end
when
the
state
brings
a
suit.
and
so
the
government
has
a
chance
to
coordinate,
to
avoid
dis-uniformity.
but
when
you
have
covered
entities,
thousands
of
them,
potentially
bringing
suit--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
in
that
sort
of
situation
you
might
be
able
to
have
a
state
law
fraud
suit.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
in
the
covered
entity
context,
the
concern
is
that,
because
you
have
so
many
of
them,
if
you
start
permitting
covered
entities
to
bring
suit,
this
is
essentially
a
preemption
question,
but
you
then
have
50
different
state
regimes,
state
court
regimes,
put
onto,
grafted
onto,
the
medicaid
rebate
requirements.
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
uniform
pricing
scheme.
and
so
once
the
requirements
become
dis-uniform,
it
becomes
very
difficult
for
hhs
to
administer
the
scheme
in
the
way
that
it's
supposed
to.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
point
out
that
the
recently
enacted
affordable
care
act
will
provide
the
exclusive
administrative
remedy
for
claims
exactly
like
respondents'
once
hhs
puts
that
into
effect.
so
congress
in
looking
at
the
scheme,
to
the
extent
it
had
concerns
about
enforcement
by
covered
entities,
the
way
it
reacted
was
not
to
create
a
private
right
of
action
or
provide
for
breach
of
contract
enforcement,
but
was
simply
to
give
the
agency
enhanced
authority
in
order
to
adjudicate--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--there
were
--
there
were
oig
reports
raising
concerns
with
oversight
and
enforcement
at
a
general
level,
and
the
way
congress
reacted
to
that
was
to
put
in
place
this
administrative
remedy
which
will
allow
covered
entities
to
bring
these
claims
and
will
allow
hhs
to
have
the
first
opportunity
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
amp
and
best
price
requirements,
and
to
take
into
account--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--yes.
the
agency
is
moving
ahead
with
that.
the
agency
has
already
issued
an
advanced
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
back
in
the
fall.
and
it
has
solicited
comments
about
how
the
--
the
administrative
scheme
should
look.
that
comment
period
has
closed,
and
so
now
the
agency
is
in
the
process
of
--
of
moving
forward
with
the
regulatory--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
that
the
agency
would
have
been
totally
without
authority
to
do
that.
it's
not
a
question
you
have
to
answer
here,
because
i
think
the
ppa
clearly
shouldn't
be
construed
to
confer
third-party
beneficiary
rights
because
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
scheme.
