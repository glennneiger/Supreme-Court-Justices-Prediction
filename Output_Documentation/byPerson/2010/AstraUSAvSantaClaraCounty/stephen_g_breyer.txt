justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
santa
clara
county
supposed
do?
they
think
they're
being
overcharged.
and
in
your
opinion
--
the
company
doesn't,
but
they
do.
so
what
are
they
supposed
to
do
if
they're
right?
how
do
they
get
the
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
interested
in
procedurally
what
are
they
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
manufacturer
says:
okay,
you're
wrong;
i'm
not;
i'm
undercharging
you.
now
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
busy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
can't
they
--
can
they,
for
example,
file
a
claim
with
the
--
with
the
secretary
and
say:
we
would
like
the
secretary
to
order
them
to
give
us
the
money;
they're
violating
this?
they
go
to
an
administrative
law
judge.
is
there
an
administrative
remedy
of
some
kind
that
would
be
reviewable
in
the
courts
for
reasonableness?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
why
is
it
reasonable,
then,
to
think
that
the
secretary
would
have
entered
into
a
contract
which
is
going
to
benefit
them
and
there's
no
remedy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
normally
under
the
law
from
marbury
v.
madison
onward,
where
there's
a
wrong,
there's
a
remedy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
remedy
could
be
administrative,
could
be
judicial,
et
cetera.
but
you're
saying
there's
none?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
such
cases,
there
very
often
is
an
administrative
remedy--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
person
always
--
any
individual
in
the
united
states
can
go
ask
any
agency
to
do
anything,
and
there
is
even
review
in
instances
of
a
refusal
to
withhold
--
a
withholding
of
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
here?
you
said
there
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
the
state
of
california
says
we
would
like
our
counties
to
be
able
to
enforce
this.
then
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
that
california
--
if
california
wants
to
say,
we
could
bring
this
suit
like
massachusetts
did,
you
agree,
they
could.
and
then
they
say,
all
right,
but
we
don't
have
the
time;
we
want
the
counties
to
do
it.
couldn't
they
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
difference
between
a
state
doing
its
itself
through
its
attorney
general
and
the
state
saying
we
would
like
the
county
to
do
it
through
its
county
attorney?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
california
comes
to
you
tomorrow
and
says,
the
attorney
general
says,
you
know,
this
is
a
problem,
you
don't
have
time
to
enforce
this,
there
should
be
some
enforcement
and
we
want
to
enforce
it,
and,
moreover,
we
would
like
each
county
affected
to
enforce
it.
do
you
have
the
authority?
is
there
any
reason
you
wouldn't
say
go
ahead?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
analogize
it
to
the
massachusetts
one.
you
say
they
can
just
go
ahead
and
do
it,
and
they
say:
you
know,
santa
clara
county
is
just
as
big
as
rhode
island.
and
you
say
the
ag
of
rhode
island
can
bring
the
suit,
am
i
right?
and
so
why
can't
the
--
why
can't
santa
clara
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true
of
--
i
was
thinking
maximum
resale
price
maintenance.
you
could
--
the
distributor
and
the
manufacturer
agree
on
the
maximum
resale
price.
pretty
unlikely
that
they
intend
the
consumers
who
are
intended
to
benefit
to
be
able
to
have
a
lawsuit.
and
i
think,
well,
gee,
i
don't
know.
what
the
government
is
arguing
is,
sure,
the
point
you
make
favors
you.
they
say
there
are
two
major
points
here
that
favor
them
about
background.
i
want
to
hear
what
your
reply
is.
one
of
them
is
congress,
in
the
statute
it
incorporated
here,
didn't
want
a
private
person
to
be
able
to
enforce
it.
and
the
second
one
is
it
is
going
to
create
a
mess.
all
right?
so
they
say
those
are
two
background
features
here
that
favor
them.
so
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
about
--
is
the
--
i'm
not
sure
i'm
right
at
all
here,
but
as
i
understand
the
development
of
this
argument
today,
it
is
open
to
you
and
the
other
57
counties
to
go
to
the
state
ag,
and
you
say,
you
bring
the
lawsuit,
okay?
or
make
us
--
make
me
a
lawyer
--
says,
make
me
an
assistant
ag
for
this
purpose.
and
i
launch
the
lawsuit
in
the
name
of
california,
and
i
can
get
to
the
same
place.
what
do
you
think
of
that?
