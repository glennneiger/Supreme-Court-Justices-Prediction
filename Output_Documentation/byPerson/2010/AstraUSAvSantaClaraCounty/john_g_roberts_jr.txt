chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
09-1273,
astra
usa
v.
santa
clara
county.
ms.
blatt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
--
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer,
but
is
it
different
in
this
case
or
unusual
that
the
agreement
is
between
the
federal
government
and
private
entities,
as
opposed
to
what
i
think
is
the
more
typical
situation
in
which
these
cases
come
up,
where
it
is,
say,
an
agreement
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
a
false
claims
act
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
--
you
emphasize
that
the
contract
has
the
language
in
haec
verba
of
the
statute.
what
if
--
what
if
it
doesn't?
the
statute
imposes
certain
provisions.
the
pricing
i
guess
is
the
key
one.
but
in
a
private
deal
when
you're
arranging
for
the
delivery
of,
you
know,
pharmaceuticals,
you
could
have
a
lot
of
provisions.
it's
got
to
be
delivered
by
this
much.
you
have
got
to
have
this
much
inventory.
you've
got
to
--
whatever.
i
mean,
what
if
the
contract
here
included
terms
beyond
those
in
the
statute?
could
those
be
enforced
by
the
third-party
beneficiaries?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
anders.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
a
contract
at
all?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
could
do
this,
i
guess,
by
regulation,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
issue
a
regulation
saying
manufacturers
who
participate
in
this
program
agree
to
do,
you
know,
whatever
your
contract
says.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
identified
the
problem
that
the
individual
beneficiaries
did
not
have
a
remedy?
they
--
or
that
courts
had
indicated
that
they
didn't
and
they
thought
there
should
be
a
remedy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
which
way
does
that
cut?
that
seems
to
me
to
put
an
awful
lot
of
power
and
authority
in
the
hands
of
one
beneficiary
and
one
lawyer
saying
--
all
they
have
to
do
is
filing
a
suit
saying,
look,
we
get
a
hundred
doses
of
lipitor
from
this
program;
we
think
we
should
get
less.
and
if
they
win,
the
whole
country's
--
the
pricing
of
lipitor
under
this
program
has
changed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
strikes
me
as
an
argument
in
favor
of
leaving
the
enforcement
with
the
secretary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
class
action,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
why
it
was
brought
as
a
class
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
miree,
that's
1977.
and
a
lot
of
your
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
is
in
the
earlier
world
of
implied
right
of
action
jurisprudence
that
has
changed
dramatically
in
the
last
30
years.
and
what
concerns
me
is
when
you
are
talking
about
the
same
language,
the
mere
fact
that
the
government
has
decided
to
go
through
a
contractual
mechanism
to
advance
this
program
doesn't
allow
you
to
use
that
to
get
an
end
run
around
all
of
the
implied
right
of
action
jurisprudence
of
the
last
30
years.
you're
on
stronger
ground
before
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
was
pretty
well
--
that
analysis
was
certainly
consistent
with
the
established
jurisprudence
in
this
area
then.
but
it
started
changing
very
quickly
thereafter.
i
think
about
1980.
and
then
consistently
went
in
the
other
direction,
to
the
point
now
where
i
think
the
jurisprudence
is
pretty
clear
that
we're
not
going
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
the
same
situation
with
the
states
under
spending
clause
legislation.
they
done
have
to
sign
up.
but
if
they
do,
then
the
issue
is,
is
there
an
implied
right
of
action
on
the
beneficiaries.
our
cases
for
the
last
25,
30
years
have
said
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
ms.
blatt,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
