justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
understand
that.
a
private
contract
is
just
that.
two
parties
go
into
the
contract.
they
set
the
terms
of
their
deal.
no
one
forced
the
manufacturers
to
enter
into
this
deal.
so
why
isn't
the
issue
exactly
what
the
circuit
court
said:
what
was
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
the
contract?
you
want
to
make
it
congress's
intent,
but
this
is
a
private
deal
between
them.
and
congress
may
have
specified
some
terms
to
include;
but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
do
you
answer
the
point
that,
if
congress
wanted
to
make
this
a
pure
regulatory
statute,
it
wouldn't
have
even
required
a
contract?
it
would
have
just
passed
a
statute
that
says
anyone
who
wants
to
--
to
sell
to
the
--
to
the
states
or
to
the
340b
entities,
you
can't
charge
more
than
this
price?
why
do
we
even
need
a
contract,
unless
inherent
with
it
is
some
discretion
in
the
agency
who's
administering
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--discretion
that
is
consistent
with
normal
contract
principles?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
adversary
claims
you
gave
up
your
argument
that
the
contract
doesn't
make
the
manufacturers
a
third-party
intended
beneficiary.
have
you
given
up
that
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
are
you
telling
me
you're
taking
--
then
you're
co-counsel
is
right;
you're
agreeing
with
her
totally
--
if
congress
wrote
the
statute,
said
these
are
the
terms
we
want
to
give
you
in
a
contract,
you
figure
out
how
to
implement
and
enforce
this,
the
secretary
says
i
don't
have
the
resources
to
enforce
this,
i'm
going
to
write
a
contract
that
gives
the
340b
entities
a
private
cause
of
action,
the
manufacturers
can
take
it
or
leave
it,
you're
taking
the
position
that
the
secretary
is
without
authority
to
do
this?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
begs
the
exception
that
justice
alito
asked
you,
which
is
if
we
go
your
route,
which
is,
is
this
a
regulatory
or
some
sort
of
other
contract,
how
do
we
tell
the
difference,
and
do
we
need
to
go
that
far?
isn't
your
position
--
i
thought
the
other
half
of
your
position
was
that
this
is
not
a
third-party
intended
beneficiary.
all
the
terms
of
the
contract
are
between
the
manufacturer
and
the
secretary
and
the
obligations
to
the
secretary,
not
the
obligations
to
the
third
parties.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
walking
away
from
your
position
in
the
district
of
massachusetts?
the
states
do
not
have,
according
to
you,
the
right
to
enforce
the
rebate
program?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
an
implied
cause
of
action?
is
that
what
you're
saying
those
state
suits
are?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
is
that
regulatory
scheme
any
different
from
the
one
involving
the
ppa?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i
understand
your
position
clearly,
in
a
regulatory
contract
situation
like
this
one
the
secretary
is
without
authority
to
decide
he
or
she
can't
enforce
the
statute
and
to
confer
expressly
by
contract
third-party
beneficiary
rights
to
the
--
to
the
people
receiving
the
benefit?
that's
the
position
you're
taking?
if
the
secretary
had
written
a
provision
into
this
contract
telling
340b
entities
you
can
sue,
that
would
have
been,
according
to
you,
ultra
vires?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
where--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--third-party
beneficiaries
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel
--
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
the
distinction
that
you
are
ignoring
in
the
law.
i
thought
it
was
very
clear
that
proof
that
you
merely
received
the
benefit
by
a
contract
is
not
proof
that
the
parties
intended
to
confer
on
you
an
enforceable
right;
is
that
correct?
is
that
the
statement
of
the
common
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
matter
how--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--no
matter
how
you
want
to
draw
this
line,
if
the
issue
is,
what's
the
objective
intents
about
enforceability,
if
i
look
at
the
ppa,
it
makes
the
manufacturer's
obligation
one-way
to
the
government
to
provide
the
pricing
information.
it
gives
only
the
government
the
right
to
institute
the
formal
dispute
resolution
system
that
the
contract
specifies.
this
is
not
the
new
law.
this
is
the
ppa
as
it
existed
at
the
time.
it
gives
only
the
secretary
other
enforcement
rights.
what
am
i
missing?
where
in
the
contract
is
there
one
provision,
one
sentence,
one
anything
that
requires
the
manufacturers,
other
than
the
price
benefit,
to
do
something
that
could
be
characterized
as
enforcement?
