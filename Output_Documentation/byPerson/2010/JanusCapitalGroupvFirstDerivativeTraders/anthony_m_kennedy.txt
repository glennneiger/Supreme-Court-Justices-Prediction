but
can
--
can
--
can
we
discuss
the
case,
and
--
and
--
and
perhaps
you
don't
think
so.
can't
we
discuss
this
case,
must
we
not
discuss
this
case,
on
the
theory
that
jcm's
scienter,
jcm's
knowledge
of
a
false
statement,
is
a
given
in
the
case?
now,
maybe
you'll
be
able
to
prove
otherwise.
you
say
that
they're
not
liable
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
the
argument
here
is
mostly
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
once
again
--
once
again,
if
the
complainants
in
the
case,
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
--
hypothetical
case,
not
this
case,
hypothetical
case
--
were
injured
shareholders
the
fund,
i
take
it
you
say
still
they
could
not
sue
jcm?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
say
that
jcm's
principal
officers
and
managers
wrote
the
statement.
you
still
say
there's
nobody?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
it's
not
attributable,
at
least
publicly,
to
jcm.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
an
alternate
theory
that
jcm
is
really
the
day-to-day
managers
in
day-to-day
active
control
of
the
fund,
and
therefore,
it
should
be
chargeable
as
if
it
and
the
fund
are
the
same
for
purposes
of
making
the
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
would
say
that
that's
different
from,
say,
an
outside
law
firm
or
an
auditor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
--
just
to
clarify
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
in
your
--
in
the
hypothetical
you
gave
where
the
president
gives
an
innocent
board
of
directors
false
information
and
the
prospectus
goes
out,
is
the
company
liable
because
their
agent
--
is
the
company
liable
under
10b-5?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
--
the
agency
relation
that
the
president
of
the
company
holds
is
different
that
than
the
agency
relation
that
jcm
holds?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
even
though
they
did
those
things,
they
acted
in
excess
of
their
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
the
allegation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
it
were
proved
that
they
did
do
those
things.
suppose
it
were
proven
that
they
did
100
percent
of
prospectus
work.
the
only
thing
that
the
fund
did
was
to
mail
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
is
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
that
statement
was
attributed
to
jcm?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can
--
you
can
play
with
the
words,
jcm?
i
--
i
see
nothing
in
--
in
the
record
that
would
justify
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
attribution
to
the
actor
is
not
necessary
for
the
actor's
liability
for
his
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
point
is
that--
