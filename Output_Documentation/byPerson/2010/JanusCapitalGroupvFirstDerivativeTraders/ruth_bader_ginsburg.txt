justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
somebody
deviated
from
what
was
the
announced
policy
--
that
there
was
to
be
no
market
timers
investing
in
this
--
in
these
janus
funds.
somebody
made
the
decision
that
certain
hedge
funds
would
be
allowed
to
engage
in
that
activity.
who
was
that
somebody?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
statement
that's
alleged
to
have
been
--
the
conduct
that
is
alleged
to
have
been
in
opposition
to
the
announced
policy,
that
is
attributable
squarely
to
--
this
is
the
entity
called
jcm?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
made
the
decision
that
violated
the
policy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nonetheless,
it's
not
a
primary
actor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
perry,
you
--
you
said
that
it
was
the
fund's
lawyers
who
drafted
the
prospectus,
but
in
fact,
it
was
jcm's
lawyers,
the
lawyers
--
they
were
in-house
lawyers
for
jcm.
and
they
served
--
served
the
fund
in
doing
this
prospectus,
but
they
were
on
the
payroll
of
jcm,
and
they
were
jcm's
legal
department.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
they
were
in-house
lawyers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
law
firm
that
--
the
lawyers
who
drafted
the
prospectus
were
in-house
counsel
for
jcm
on
jcm's
payroll?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
weren't
the
independent
outside
lawyers
who
were
representing
the
board
or
the
fund;
they
were
the
in-house
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
guess
my
question
was
simply:
the
drafters
of
the
prospectus
were
the
in-house
counsel
for
jcm?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
this
case
--
this
case
went
off
on
--
in
the
district
court,
it
was
--
was
it
12b-6?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
and
all
that
the
fourth
circuit
said
is,
it
goes
beyond;
it
has
to
go
further.
and
the
--
the
impression
that
i
got
from
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
is
--
and
it
could
be
reduced
to
a
very
simple
statement.
they
say:
jcm
was
in
the
driver's
seat.
it
was
running
the
show.
and
if
that
can
be
proved,
they
thought
that
they
would
have
a
good
case
under--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that
was
--
i
mean,
before
you
started
out
with
statements
that
sounded
like
the
sky
is
falling
because
lawyers
would
no
longer
be
safe,
banks
would
no
longer
be
safe
--
but
the
fourth
circuit
was
--
was
a
much
narrower
view.
its
view
was,
this
--
jcm
was
the
manager.
it
was
controlling
everything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
did
it
reserve
that?
you
said
twice
in
your
brief
that
janus
is
a
name
to
which
jcm
reserves
the
right.
how
did
it
reserve
the
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
that
connection,
just
again,
would
you
answer
the
--
the
statement
that
mr.
perry
made
that
the
government
had,
in
fact
conceded
that
this
theory
would
spread,
not
only
to
--
to
the
investment
advisor
so
closely
linked
to
funds
but
to
every
lawyer,
every
accountant,
every
bank.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
you
said
that
on
page
something
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
--
the
whole
arrangement
was
made
possible
by
jcm.
jcm
wants
long-term
investors,
so
it
puts
this
provision
in
the
prospectus.
the
board
of
directors
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
jcm
is
dissembling
and
it's
going
to
go
out
and
seek
hedge
funds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
theory
of
--
of
the
fund
shareholders?
you
said
the
fund
shareholders
recovered
during
the
settlement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what
was
that
act?
