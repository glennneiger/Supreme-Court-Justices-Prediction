justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
is
jcm
an
agent?
are
you
acknowledging
that
they're
an
agent
of
--
of
the
fund?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
purposes
are
that?
for
purposes
of
--
at
issue
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
that
the
question
on
which
we
granted
cert
was
very
clear:
whether
the
fourth
circuit
erred
in
concluding
that
a
service
provider
can
be
held
primarily
liable
in
the
private
securities
fraud
action
for,
quote,
"helping",
close
quote,
or,
quote,
"participating
in",
close
quote,
another
company's
misstatements.
now,
is
--
is
that
an
accurate
description
of
the
court's
holding?
it
was
not
objected
to
by
the
respondent
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
i
thought
we
granted.
we
weren't
talking
about
control
here.
that
--
that
was
not
the
issue,
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
frederick,
is
that
an
accurate
description
of
--
of
the
question
before
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
you
object
to
it
in
--
in
your
--
in
your
opposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
but
we
--
we
don't
reevaluate
facts.
we
--
we
review
the
holding
of
a
lower
court.
now,
was
this
an
accurate
description
of
the
holding
of
the
fourth
circuit?
and
if
it
wasn't,
why
didn't
you
say
that
in
your
brief
in
opposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
make
the
statements?
isn't
that
the
statutory
text
that
we're
dealing
with?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
did
make
the
statements?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
go
out
under
their
name.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
someone
writes
a
speech
for
me,
one
can
say
he
drafted
the
speech,
but
i
make
the
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
--
it
depends
on
the
context
of
"make".
if
you're
talking
about
making
heaven
and
earth,
yes,
that
means
to
create,
but
if
you're
talking
about
making
a
representation,
that
means
presenting
the
representation
to
someone,
not
--
not
drafting
it
for
someone
else
to
make.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
jcm
falsely
represented
what
it
would
do,
it
made
that
false
representation
to
the
fund,
and
the
fund,
as
has
been
acknowledged,
would
have
a
cause
of
action
against
jcm.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
what's
going
on
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
isn't
clear
from
all
of
those
things
is
that
jcm
made
any
representation
to
the
public.
the
representation
was
made
in
the
prospectus
issued
by
the
fund,
not
by
jcm.
now,
the
fund
may
have
a
cause
of
action
against
jcm,
but
what's
crucial
here
is
whether
--
whether
you
can
establish
that
it
is
jcm
who
made
the
representation
to
the
public,
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
there.
you
might
proceed
under
the
control
provision,
but
not
by
saying
that
they
made
the
representation.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
just
like
writing
a
speech
for
somebody.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
carry
a
letter
over
and
file
it
on
behalf
of
some
principal,
does
it
become
my
letter?
have
i
made
that
representation?
sure,
they
filed
it.
what
does
that
prove?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
you
say,
they
have
no
other
agents,
unless
the
trustees
themselves
were
going
to
walk
over
and
file
it.
jcm
was
functioning
in
that
capacity
as
an
employee
of
the
fund
in
the
filing.
they
didn't
file
it
on
their
own
behalf.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
their
own
behalf?
justice
antonin
scalia
common
lawsuit
for
duping.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
frederick,
i
thought
we
had
held
--
i
was
sure
we
had
held
that
there
is
no
aiding
and
abetting
liability--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
the
provision
we're
discussing
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
deny
that
the
fund
had
substantive
control?
couldn't
the
fund
have
stopped
this
statement
from
being
placed
in
its
prospectus?
didn't
it
have
outside
lawyers
who
advised
it
whether
it
should
allow
this
statement
to
be
included
in
its
prospectus?
how
can
you
say
that
they
--
they
didn't
have
control?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
mean
that
they're
duped,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
don't
have
control.
they
had
control,
but
you
say
they
--
they
were
duped,
but
that's
quite
a
different
theory
from
saying
that
they
had
control
--
that
they
didn't
have
control.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that's
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
--
of
--
of
make
a
statement
indirectly.
i
mean,
you
can
make
it
indirectly
by
not
issuing
it
yourself
but
having
somebody
else
make
it
in
your
name.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
would
not
say
i'm
making
a
speech
indirectly
if
i
have
drafted
the
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
person
for
whom
i
drafted
the
speech
is
making
the
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
will
always
be
charged.
it's
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
to
charge
scienter.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you've
bought
yourself
a
big
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
should
change
that,
because
congress
has
made
it
very
clear
that
investment
advisors
are
not
to
be
treated
like
employees.
you
--
you
want
us
to
undo
a
clear
distinction
that
congress
has
made.
