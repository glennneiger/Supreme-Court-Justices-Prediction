mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--a
primary
violator
must
be
somebody
who
has
actually
committed
all
the
elements
of
a
10b-5--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
the
elements
for
the
private
cause
of
action
are
the
ones
that
this
court
has
repeated.
they
are--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--in
this
case
the
key
one
we're
talking
about
is
you
would
need
to
be
an
actual
maker
of
the
statement,
and
--
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it
--
we
think
that
somebody
can
make
a
statement
if
they
create
the
statement,
and
the
statute
and
the
rule
both
expressly
apply
to
those
who
make
statements
directly--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--scienter
is
another
element,
and
so
a
lawyer
who
just
reviews
the
policy,
jcm
in
this
case,
when
jcm
submitted
false
statements
to
the
funds,
if
the
funds
were
unaware,
this
is
where
mr.
frederick
concluded
for
the
chief
justice
that
if
there
--
if
the
person
who
actually
releases
the
statement
to
the
world
has
been
duped
and
doesn't
have
scienter,
then
there
is
--
they
are
not
going
to
be--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--a
primary
violator.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
under
sections
20
--
it
depends
on
what
the
situation--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes,
if
the
situation
here
is
one
in
which
the
funds
ultimately
cannot
be
proved
to
have
scienter.
if
they
did
not
know
about
the
falsity
of
the
statements
in
the
prospectuses
that
they
released
to
the
public,
then
there
would
not
be
a
primary
violator.
under
section
20(e)
for
aiding
and
abetting
liability,
the
commission
can
bring
an
aiding
and
abetting
claim
against
somebody
who
provides
substantial
assistance,
recklessly
or
knowingly
--
recklessly
or
knowingly
provides
substantial
assistance
to
a
primary
violator,
but
the
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear
that
a
primary
violator
needs
to
have
violated
all
of
the
elements
of
a
10b-5
cause
of
action
which
includes--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--no,
i
don't
think
that
that's
necessary.
if
the
position
--
the
position
that
the
commission
has
taken
is
that
somebody
who
makes
a
statement,
if
he
writes
the
statement
or
provides
the
false
information
that's
used
to
construct
the
statement
or
allows
the
statement
to
be
attributed
to
him,
and
we
think
that
that's
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
term
"make",
because
the
statute
and
the
rule
both
apply
to
persons
who
make
the
statement
directly
or
indirectly.
and,
so,
they
could
be
using
a
conduit,
whether
the
conduit
is
witting
or
unwitting,
they
would
be
a
primary
violator
if
they
had--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
if--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
but
if--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
that
may
be
true
in
the
case
of
a
speech,
justice
scalia,
but
in
a
classic
boiler
room
situation,
where
somebody
has
written
the
scripts
for
salespersons
to
--
to
use
in
order
to
make
calls
to
sell
stocks,
the
person
who
actually
writes
the
scripts
may
never
speak
the
words
to
a
customer,
he
may
never
have
his
own
name
spoken
on
the
phone,
and
therefore,
the
statements
have
not
been
attributed
to
him--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--if
he
writes
it
out
and
he
doesn't
know,
he
obviously
isn't
liable--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--in
that
instance,
because
he
was
acting
specifically
at
the
direction
of
superiors--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--they
gave--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it
--
we
do,
on
page
22,
acknowledge
that
somebody
needs
to
be
sufficiently
involved
in
the
creation
or
dissemination
of
the
statement
in
order
to
be
--
in
order
to
be
deemed
its
maker
or
its
author.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
in
this
instance
there's
no
doubt
that
the
manager
of
the
funds
was
not
a
mere
advisor.
they
bodily--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
the
--
the
test
does
acknowledge
that
--
that
if
there
is
not
sufficient
control
over
the
content
of
the
--
the
message
and
the
dissemination
of
it
that
somebody
may
be
more
in
an
advisory
capacity.
that
might
be
the
instance
with
lots
of
outside
law
firms
when
they're
acting
at
the
specific
direction
of
counsel.
that's
not
the
situation
of--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--we
said
that
--
he
was
referring
to
the
statement
on
page
22
of
the
government's
brief,
referring
to
the
need
--
for
the
--
for
the
author
to
be
sufficiently
involved
in
creating
or
disseminating
the
statement.
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
recognize
that
scienter
is
an
important
limiting
--
limiting
principle
for
the
10b-5
cause
of
action.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
it
would
be--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it's
not
simple,
justice
scalia,
in
light
of
the
pslra,
there
requires
it
to
be
alleged
with
articularly;
there
need
to
be
facts
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
a
strong
inference
that
the
defendant
acted
with
scienter,
and
--
and
there
are
penalties
beyond
rule
11
that
are
--
that
are
imposed
if
the
--
if
the
plaintiff
is
--
is
mistaken
in
doing
so.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
that's
correct.
we
think
that
--
and
any
other
rule
would
immunize
falsely
attributed
or
anonymous
statements.
and
if
the
whole
purpose
of
a
fraud
was
to
convince
somebody
that
this
statement
came
from
warren
buffet,
so
that
i
could
turn
a
quick
buck
before
the
market
realized
that
it
wasn't
actually
from
warren
buffett,
the
fact
that
it
was
not
attributed
to
me
would
not
change
the
fact
that
i
had
made
the
statement
and
that
the
market
had
relied
upon
it.
the
truth
is
that
reasonable
investors,
and
that's
the
test
for
purposes
of
reliance,
can
rely
on
anonymous
and
falsely
attributed
statements.
in
this
instance
there's
no
reason
to
doubt
that
an
investor
would
have
relied
on
statements
in
the
prospectus
about
the
fund's
purported
antimarket
timing
and
excessive
trading
policies.
and
so
we
think
that
there
--
in
general
there
doesn't
need
to
be
an
attribution
requirement,
but
in
this
instance
it's
quite
clear
that
a
reasonable
investor
could
have
relied
on
these
--
prospectus.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
the
control
person
liability
also
needs
to
have
a
primary
violator
under
the
terms
of
20(a).
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
think
the
easiest
way
would
be
to
analogize
it
to
the
cases
involving
corporate
employees.
as
petitioners
acknowledge,
there
are
cases
where
a
corporate
employee
drafts
a
statement
that's
issued
in
the
company's
name.
in
this
instance
the
investment
advisor
is
management
for
the
company,
and
the
fact
that
they
happen
to
be
management
by
virtue
of
contract
rather
than
just
the
internal
arrangements
of
the
corporation
shouldn't
change
that
arrangement.
it
--
it's
also
the
case
that
if
the
court
were
--
were
looking
for
a
way
to
narrow
its
holding,
it
could
do
so
by
talking
about
the
elements
of
the
10b-5
cause
of
action,
which
--
which
would
apply
only
to
private
suits
and
--
and
not
to
enforcement
actions
brought
by
the
commission
or
by
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
the
--
that
statute
says
that
somebody
--
any
person
makes
the
false
statement
directly
or
indirectly,
and
in
this
instance
the
sec
sought
--
got
a
cease
and
desist
order
that's
reprinted
at
--
on
page
407
in
the
joint
appendix
that
was
predicated
on
a
provision
of
the
investment
company
act,
section
34b,
that
--
that
tracks
10b
and
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
to
make
any
untrue
statement
of
material
facts;
and
the
commission
believes
that
they
were
chargeable
with
that
violation.
