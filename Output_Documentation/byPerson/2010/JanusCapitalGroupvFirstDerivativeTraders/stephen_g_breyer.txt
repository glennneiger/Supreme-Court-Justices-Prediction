justice
stephen
g.

what
happens
if
the
president
of
the
oil
company,
knowing
that
the
statement
is
false,
says:
we
have
discovered
42
trillion
barrels
of
oil
in
yucatan.
he
writes
it
on
a
piece
of
paper;
he
gives
it
to
the
board
of
trustees;
they
think
it's
true
and
they
issue
it.
joe
smith
buys
stock
and
later
loses
money.
can
joe
smith
sue
the
president
of
yucatan,
of
the
oil
company,
for
having
made
an
untrue
statement
of
material
fact?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
he
is
--
he
didn't
issue
it.
what
he
did
was
he
gave
it
to
the
board
of
trustees,
who
issued
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
the
president
of
the
company.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
asking
what
happens.
is
there
recovery?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
is
running
the
business,
the
daily
affairs,
of
the
company.
of
course
the
president
of
a
company
is
an
authorized
agent
of
the
company,
and
so,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
he
is
subject
to
liability,
why
isn't
your
firm,
your
client,
subject
to
liability,
who,
after
all,
run
every
affair
of
the
fund?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
what
a
president
does.
the
president
of
a
company
manages
the
company.
and
if
the
president
is
liable,
why
isn't
the
group
of
people
who
do
everything
for
the
company
--
why
aren't
they
liable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
you
have
to
explain
it
to
me
more.
i'm
not
being
difficult.
i
understand
this
less
well
than
you
think
i
do,
and
i
want
to
know.
that's
an
obvious,
naive
question,
and
i
would
like
an
answer
that
anyone
could
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
get
it.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
on
the
papers
here,
it's
--
it's
the
trustees
that
manage
everything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
govern
everything,
and
these
are
like
helpers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
do
a
lot
as
helpers.
now,
let
me
suggest
to
you,
if
that's
one
possible
distinction,
what
about
this
distinction:
that
the
managers
of
a
fund,
even
though
they
are
outsourced
people
brought
in,
are
liable
as
principals,
not
aiders
or
abettors,
if
--
following
criminal
law
here,
if
--
they
are
principals
if
they
get
the
false
statement
to
the
public
through
a
conduit,
the
conduit
being
an
entity
or
person
that
is
unaware
of
the
falsity
of
the
statement?
that's
lafave
on
criminal
law.
what
is
--
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it
that
--
i'm
unclear
on
this.
that's
why
i
use
the
oil
company
example.
plain,
ordinary
--
the
top
executives
in
the
oil
company
write
the
false
statement.
they
give
it
to
a
board
that
doesn't
know
it's
false,
and
the
board
puts
it
out
in
its
name.
now,
it
seems
to
me
it
ought
to
be
clear
at
this
point
in
securities
law
whether
those
--
the
president
and
the
vice
president
are
or
are
not
liable
under
this
10-b,
the
(b)
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
are
liable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
they
are
liable?
all
right.
then
their
response
to
that
is:
this
is
not
like
the
president
of
the
oil
company,
and
the
reason
that
it's
not
is
something
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
obligation
that
runs
between
the
managers
and
the
fund,
which
is
somehow
different
between
--
you
understand
it
better
than
i.
can
you
say
what
it
is
and
what
you
think
your
response
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you're
saying
--
you're
saying
it
shouldn't
matter
that
--
if
they
issued
worse
if
they
run
the
whole
company
than
if
they're
just
the
president?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
at
that
point,
we
get
into
a
problem,
and
the
problem
is
how
do
we
distinguish
an
aider
or
abettor
from
the
principal?
at
that
point
i
am
uncertain
indeed,
and
that's
why
i
put
out
this
for
comment,
this
suggestion
that
you
follow
criminal
law
here
and
say
at
least
they
are
a
principal
if
they
have
a
high
position,
they
participate
in
it,
they
do
all
these
things
you
say,
and
the
entity
they're
fooling
in
the
first
instance
is
simply
a
conduit,
and
therefore,
you
cannot
say
it's
a
scheme,
because
the
other
part
of
the
scheme
wasn't
part
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
difference
between
substantial
assistance
and
doing
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
distinction.
you
want
to
say
what
the
distinction
is.
so
i
would
say,
consistent
with
the
view,
there
is
no
aiding
and
abetting
liability.
you
still
would
win
your
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
may
just
be
some
poor
associate,
his
first
day
at
work.
the
law
firm
sent
him
there
and
he
got
stuck
down
in
the
boiler
room.
and
somebody
said,
why
don't
you
write
something
that
will
get
everybody
to
sell
things,
and
--
and
why
don't
you
say
we're
a
thousand
tons
of
oil
instead
of
only
a
ton.
in
--
he
writes
it
out.
you
think
he's
liable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
at
some
level
he
knows,
"i
shouldn't
be
saying
they
found
1,000
tons
of
oil
when
they
only
found
50.
"
okay?
and
four
people
told
him
to
go
do
something
like
that,
but
he's
the
guy
who
wrote
it.
i
would
say
he
didn't
behave
well,
but
i
don't
think
he's
the
principal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
say
what
words
to
write.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
gave
him
the
general
idea,
and
then
he
did
it.
he
created
the
words,
to
use
your
phrase;
when
you
say
creating
the
words,
he's
a
great
writer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
now
we
have
"sufficiently
involved".
once
we're
into
sufficiently
involved,
we're
back
into
what
is
sufficient
to
make
the
person
the
principal
rather
than
the
aider
and
the
abettor,
and
apparently
creating
or
writing
the
statement
is
not
clear
whether
it
is
or
is
not
sufficient.
so
we're
back
into
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
interested
in
your
test.
i'm
interested
in
your
test,
not
the--
