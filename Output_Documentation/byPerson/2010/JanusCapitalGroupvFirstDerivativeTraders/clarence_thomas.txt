janus
capital
group,
a
publicly
traded
company
created
janus
investment
fund,
a
collection
of
mutual
funds.
janus
investment
fund
then
hired
janus
capital
management
or
jcm
wholly
on
subsidiary
of
janus
capital
group,
to
be
its
investment
advisor
and
administrator.
as
required
by
statute,
janus
investment
fund
filed
prospectuses
with
the
securities
exchange
commission
for
its
mutual
funds.
some
of
the
--
those
pros
--
prospectuses
suggested
that
jcm
would
implement
policies
against
market
timing,
a
trading
strategy
that
can
harm
investors.
when
it
came
to
light
that
jcm
permitted
market
timing,
investors
withdrew
money
from
the
janus
investment
fund,
mutual
funds.
janus
capital
group
stock
price
also
plummeted.
respondents,
stockholders
of
janus
capital
group
sued
janus
capital
group
and
jcm
under
sec
rule
10b-5
which
makes
it
unlawful
to
make
any
untrue
statement
of
material
fact
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
the
stockholders
alleged
that
--
that
the
companies
have
made
material
untrue
statements
by
participating
in
the
writing
and
dissemination
of
the
prospectuses.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
stockholders
had
alleged
sufficient
facts
claimed
that
both
companies
had
made
misleading
statements.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
purposes
of
rule
10b-5,
the
maker
of
a
statement
is
a
person
or
entity
with
ultimate
authority
over
the
statement
including
its
content
and
whether
and
how
to
communicate
it.
here,
even
if
jcm
assisted
with
the
drafting
of
the
prospectuses,
they
were
janus
investment
fund's
prospectuses
and
that
company
had
ultimate
authority
over
them.
janus
investment
fund,
not
jcm
or
janus
capital
group
made
the
statements.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
sotomayor
and
kagan
joined.
