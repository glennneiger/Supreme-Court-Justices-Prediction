justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
perry,
who
wrote
the
relevant
statements?
justice
elena
kagan
i
understand
that
they
were
in
the
fund's
prospectus,
but
who
wrote
them?
justice
elena
kagan
who
paid
those
lawyers?
justice
elena
kagan
so
jcm
paid
the
lawyers?
justice
elena
kagan
and
so
it
was
jcm's
lawyers
who
wrote
the
prospectus,
including
the
relevant
statements
here,
the
asserted
misrepresentations?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
suppose
the
complaint
had
alleged
that.
suppose
the
complaint
had
simply
said:
jcm's
lawyers
authored
the
relevant
statements
in
the
prospectus.
justice
elena
kagan
would
that
be
enough
to
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
elena
kagan
they're
paid
by
jcm.
justice
elena
kagan
these
are
in-house
counsel
for
the
investment
advisor.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
perry,
does
the
fund
have
employees?
justice
elena
kagan
who
are
the
fund's
employees?
justice
elena
kagan
are
all
of
the
employees
also
employees
of
jcm?
justice
elena
kagan
and
could
you
just
run
through
a
little
bit
how
one
of
these
prospectuses
gets
--
gets
issues
eventually?
the
jcm
lawyers
start
the
process
by
drafting,
and
then
what
happens?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
here,
i
believe
there
was
a
statement
in
your
interrogatories
that
it's
jcm's
lawyers,
in-house
lawyers,
who
drafted
the
relevant
statement.
justice
elena
kagan
and
then
what
happens?
justice
elena
kagan
was
there
any
change
to
these
statements
made
by
the
board
of
trustees?
justice
elena
kagan
yes.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
frederick,
a
substantial
part
of
the
power
of
your
argument
comes
from
this
notion
that,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
that
jcm
was
in
the
driver's
seat,
that
jcm
had
control,
that
they
were
--
janus
was
at
most
an
alter
ego
of
jcm
and
maybe
something
more,
that
it
was
just
a
creature
of
jcm.
but
the
securities
legislation
seems
to
deal
with
that
in
section
20.
and
your
case
is
not
brought
under
section
20,
and
because
of
the
relationship
between
mutual
funds
and
their
investment
advisors,
presumably
could
not
be
brought
under
section
20.
so,
why
should
we
think
relevant
the
kind
of
controlled
relationship
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
gannon,
suppose
that
we
think
that
the
test
that
the
sec
is
using
and
you
recite
on
page
13
is
really
pretty
broad
and
that
it
might
apply
to
a
range
of
factual
situations
that
are
not
before
us.
is
there
a
way
to
confine
our
holding
just
to
the
mutual
fund
situation,
and
if
there
is,
how
would
you
do
that?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
perry,
on
the
allegations
of
this
complaint,
these
plaintiffs
were
harmed
by
the
misrepresentations,
the
alleged
misrepresentations
from
jcm
to
the
fund.
so
if
the
fund
was
duped,
would
these
shareholders,
jcm's
shareholders,
have
any
relief?
