mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
think
it
is,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
did
object,
in
the
sense
that
we
described
the
complaint's
allegations
as
jcm
writing
and
preparing
and
being
responsible
for
the
prospectus.
and
the
question
of--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
did
say
it
in
our
brief
in
opposition,
justice
scalia,
and
the
solicitor
general,
when
you
called
for
the
views
of
the
solicitor
general,
also
said
in
the
invitation
brief
that
this
case
was
not
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
deciding
just
simply
jcm
was
responsible
for
the
prospectuses
in
all
their
various
aspects:
in
writing,
preparing,
et
cetera.
and
so
we--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--so
we
would
submit
that
for
the
reasons
we
stated
in
our
opposition
and
we
stated
in
our
red
brief,
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court
on
reviewing
a
motion
to
dismiss
of
a
complaint's
well-pleaded
allegations
--
and
i
can
go
through
the
complaint's
allegations
if
you
like
that
explain
how
jcm
wrote
and
prepared
the
prospectus
and
the
policies
for
the
fund
and
then
implemented
them
falsely
--
we
would
submit
this
case
is
not
about
service
providers,
but
it
is
about
janus
capital
management
being
the
primary
violator.
they
were
the
ones
who
had
the
motive
to
lie,
they
had
the
incentive
to
lie,
and
they
did
lie.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
they
did.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
they
composed
and
created--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
did,
in--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
we
address
the
definition
of
sec's
interpretation,
which
is
entitled
to
deference,
as
to
being
to
create
or
to
compose
or
to
accept
as
one's
own.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
the
prospectus,
there
is
a
section
on
management
that
explains
that
janus
capital
management
engages
in
the
day-to-day
functions.
there
are
no
employees
of
janus
funds
themselves.
all
of
this
is
outsourced
management--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--but
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--right.
what
they
don't
have,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
where
the
falsity
is
here,
is
the
ability
of
any
of
those
outsiders
to
determine
whether
or
not
implementing
the
policy
will
be
done
fraudulently,
and
that's
where
the
culpability
is
here.
jcm
runs
these
funds,
and
although
the
statement
might
get
accepted
by
the
board
of
trustees--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
what
they
did
was
to
falsely
represent
what
they
would
do
with
that
statement.
i
would
direct
the
court
to
paragraph
5.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
is
a
statement
of
both,
in
the
sense
that
the
fund
is
attracting
investors,
but
the
fund
is
managed
and
controlled
by
the
investment
manager;
here,
jcm.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
in
fact,
paragraph
5
of
the
complaint
says
janus
is
representing
that
its
mutual
funds
--
janus
capital
management,
its
mutual
funds
--
were
designed
to
be
long-term
investments.
it
then
says
in
paragraph
6:
"as
recognized
in
the
prospectuses,
jcm
purported
market
timing
policy
was
designed
to
protect
long-term
investors.
"
so
if
you
read
the
prospectus
and
you
read
the
complaint,
it
is
absolutely
clear
what
janus
capital
management
is
telling
all
the
mutual
fund
investors
of
the
world:
if
you
invest
in
janus,
we
will
protect
your
long-term
investments.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
scalia,
they
wrote
the
prospectus.
they're--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
when
they
issued
the
prospectus,
they
used
their
address
and
represented
to
the
public
that
they--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--sorry.
jcm
filed
it
and
disseminated
it
on
its
website,
and
all
investors
in
the
janus
funds
knew
to
--
knew
to
make
inquiries
to
the
manager
if
they
had
any
question
about
the
funds.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
it's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
they
did.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
absolutely.
they
created
the
fund,
justice
scalia.
that's
how
mutual
funds
work.
managers
create
them,
they
lure
investors
to
them,
they
get
money
by
having
a
percentage
of
assets
under
management.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
certainly,
but
there
are
many
cases
--
in
fact,
i
don't
think
it's
ever
been
disputed
in
the
courts
of
appeals
that
if
one
company
outsources
its
management
function
and
those
outsourced
managers
make
lies
on
behalf
of
the
company,
they
are
also--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--mr.
chief
justice,
my
answer
to
your
question
is:
that's
actually
a
very
difficult
question
under
fiduciary
duty
law,
because
here,
the
fiduciaries
have
been
duped
themselves.
they,
when
they
got
the
wording
of
the
prospectus
and
the
policy
that
jcm
was
purporting
to
implement
--
jcm
didn't
tell
the
board
that
there
are
12
secret
deals
with
hedge
funds,
pursuant
to
which
we're
going
to
make
money
by
attracting
long-term
investors
and
make
money
with
short-term
market
climbers--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
in
no
instance
that
i'm
aware
of
where
a
mutual
fund
investment
advisor
is
a
publicly
traded
company
would
that
cause
of
action
run
on
behalf
of
the
managers
shareholders.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
company
with
a
product,
and
they
lie
about
the
product.
and
in
that
instance,
it's
no
different
from
the
vioxx
case
last
year
with
merck
or
the
difference
from
the
cold
remedy
case
you
are
going
to
hear
argument
in
next
term.
the
mutual
funds
happen
to
be
the
product
of
the
company.
they
make
misstatements
about
the
product--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
the
outside
lawyers,
i
think,
are
distinguishable
in
a
number
of
different
ways.
one
is
that
they
are
reacting
on
information
provided
by
the
company.
that
information
is
typically
not
subject
to
an
independent
investigation
by
outside
counsel
to
determine
the
truth
or
veracity
of
the
information.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
there
is
scienter,
where
the
lawyers
knowingly
act
in
a
way
that
helps
or
that
contributes
to
that
fraud,
they
may
well
be
subject
as
aiders
and
abettors.
it
depends
on
whether
you
can
establish
that
the
lawyers
have
met
all
of
the
elements.
i
mean,
you
would
have
to
show
reliance.
you
would
have
to
show
lost
causation.
you
would
have
to
show
the
primary
violation
of
the
party--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--sorry.
the
sec
would
be
able
to
proceed
against
the
lawyers
for
aiding
and
abetting.
whether
or
not
there
would
be
a
private
action
would
depend
on
whether
the
lawyers
--
it
could
be
pleaded
under
the
heightened
pleading
requirements
that
they
had
met
all
of
the
elements
of
the
10b-5
claim.
i
would
submit
that's
extremely
difficult.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
and
we
cited
those
cases--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
believe
at
page
37.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
what
i
will
say
is
that
they
don't
have
a
principal
distinction
between
those
two
situations.
simply
having
a
contract
to
outsource
management
where
those
management
functions
of
the
company
are
resulting
in
false
statements
issued
by
the
company
shouldn't
make--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
to
be
a
primary
violator,
you
have
to
have
met
all
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
to
be
an
aider
and
abettor
for
sec
enforcement
purposes,
you
simply
have
to
provide
substantial
assistance
to
one
who
is
a
primary
violator.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
you
would
not
have
to
make
the
statement.
you
would
do
something
to
assist
the
person
making
the
statement.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct,
because
there
is
no
primary
violator
under
jcm's
view
of
the
facts
here.
they
are
the
primary
violator
under
our
view
of
the
facts
here,
because
they
met
all
of
the
elements
of
the
10b-5
action,
and
they
had
a
motive
do
it,
and
they
made--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
would.
it
would
be
somewhat
different
because
we
would
plead
multiple
violators
as
the
court
and
central
bank
and
from
which--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it's
the
failure
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
would
not
have
met
all
of
the
elements
of
the
10b-5
claim.
you
have
to
have
someone
--
you
have
two
people,
okay?
both
of
them
have
to
have
satisfied
all
the
elements
of
a
10b-5
claim
to
be
primary
violators.
if
there
is
one
element
that
is
not
satisfied
with
respect
to
that
person,
that
person
is
only
an
aider
and
abettor
and
not
subject
to
private
remedies
under
section
10(b).
they
would
be
subject
to
aiding
and
abetting
liability
under
the
sec.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
no,
in
the
sense
that
we
believe,
and
we
assert
in
the
complaint
and
the
complaint
is
adequately
pleaded,
is
that
jcm
made
the
statements.
now--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
who
has
substantive
control
over
the
content
of
the
message.
that
kind
of
substantive
control,
as
--
as
the
court
in
the
utah
ten
commandments
case
pointed
out,
the
government
can
have
speech
attributed
to
it
on
the
basis
of
it
putting
up
a
monument
on
public
land.
there
can
be
multiple
speakers
with
respect
to
one
message,
and
the
question
of
how
much
substantive
control
you
attribute
to
a
particular
speaker
we
believe
is
the
appropriate
way
to
view--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
they
did
not
have
a
knowledge
of
the
falsity.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
justice
scalia,
they
didn't
have
substantive
control
over
the
content
of
the
message,
because
if
they
did,
they
would
not
have
allowed
these
false
statements
to
have
been
issued.
and
that's
the
whole
point
--
that's
the
theory
here,
jcm
was
luring
long-term
investors
with
the
promise,
if
you
park
your
money
with
the
janus
funds,
it
will
be
safe
in
--
from
the
kinds
of
market
timing
problems.
they
were
then
secretly
going
out
and
luring
money
from
the
hedge
funds
for
then--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
public
understood
it
that
way.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
ja
275a,
justice
--
justice
kennedy
--
excuse
me
--
says
that
janus
capital
management
reserved
the
janus
name
for
itself.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
said,
and
this
is
at
page
275a,
if
for
some
reason
janus
capital
management's
contract
is
terminated,
the
funds
can
no
longer
use
the
janus
name.
they
were
intending
to
trademark
and
get
the
name
out
there
to
attract
investors
to
the
investment
advisor's
method
of
investing.
and
it
was
that
type
of
usage
that
brought
all
of
this
together.
the
fund
and
the
management,
they
are
in
function
essentially
one
entity.
the
fact
that
they
have
contractually
outsourced
the
management
function
should
not
alleviate
the
securities
fraud
that
is
alleged
here.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
you
don't
want
to
create
a
road
map
for
other
people
to
commit
fraud,
justice
kagan,
and
that's
what
their
theory
does.
what
their
theory
does
is
it
says
is
we
set
up
shell
companies
or
if
we
dupe
people
to
make
statements,
we
can
commit
securities
fraud
with
impunity,
because
we
won't
be
held
liable
to
having
made
the
statement,
even
though
we
wrote
it,
we
had
substantive
control
over
it,
et
cetera.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
chief
justice
roberts,
this
court
on
numerous
occasions
has
said
that
the
private
securities
action
is
a
complement
to
the
enforcement
efforts
of
the
sec,
and
in
this
instance,
the
shareholders
of
the
investment--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--but,
no,
the
problem,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
under
their
construction
of
the
facts
there's
no
primary
violator.
mr.
perry
said
this
morning--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--there's
no
primary
violator.
and,
so,
if
there's
no
primary
violator,
there
can
be
no
controlled
person
and
there
can
be
no
aiding
and
abetting.
