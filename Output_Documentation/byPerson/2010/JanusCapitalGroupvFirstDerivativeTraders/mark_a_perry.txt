mr.
mark
a.
perry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
affirming
the
judgment
below
would
authorize
private
securities
fraud
class
actions
against
every
service
provider
that
participates
in
the
drafting
of
a
public
company's
prospectus.
it
is
therefore
nothing
less
than
a
frontal
assault
on
this
court's
decisions
in
central
bank
and
stoneridge.
in
those
cases,
your
honors,
this
court
held
that
service
providers
may
not
be
sued
primarily
in
private
class
actions
and
left
that
matter
for
congress
to
resolve.
and
congress
did
respond,
not
once,
not
twice,
but
three
times,
to
those
decisions.
first,
in
the
pslra,
the
congress
authorized
a
federal
action,
a
government
action,
only
against
aiders
and
abettors,
leaving
the
question
of
private
class
actions
for
this
court's
resolution.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
sotomayor,
the
challenge
statements
appear
in
the
prospectuses
for
the
janus
funds,
separate
legal
entities
not
parties
to
this
lawsuit.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
the
company
--
excuse
me
--
the
conduit
or
analyst
cases
fall
under
two
categories,
neither
of
which
is
met
here.
first,
they
are
a
scheme
between
the
company
--
orchestrated
by
the
company
to
distribute
its
information
through
the
analysts
to
the
market,
and
they
are
brought
under
10b-5(a)
as
scheme
cases.
that
is
most
of
the
analyst
cases.
there
is
no
10b-5(a)
claim
in
this
case.
this
is
only
a
10b-5(b)-making
claim.
second,
those
few
cases,
the
analyst
cases
that
are
brought
under
(b),
involve
an
admission;
that
is,
the
company
has
failed
to
correct
a
statement
made
by
an
analyst
where
there
is
a
duty
to
do
so.
there
is
no
omission
claim
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
duty--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
the
company
makes
the
statement
to
the
market.
under
basic,
the
analyst
is
the
market.
it
is
the
ears
of
the
market
that
takes
the
information.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
the
analyst
cases,
the
issuer
speaks
to
the
market
directly.
here,
there
is
an
intervening
legal
entity,
the
janus
funds.
scienter
or
no
scienter,
that
is
a
separate
corporation--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--justice
sotomayor,
the
congress
has
drafted
two
statutes
that
deal
with
puppets.
section
20(b),
which
these
plaintiffs
have
not
invoked,
makes
it
unlawful
for
one
party
to
do
indirectly
what
it
would
not
be
permitted
to
do
directly.
that's
the
puppet
statute,
the
ventriloquist
dummy
statute.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
no.
there
is
also
20(a),
which
is
the
control
person
statute,
also
not
invoked
by
these
plaintiffs.
those
are
forms
of
secondary
liability,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
court's
questions
go
to
the
distinction
between
primary
and
secondary
liability.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
sotomayor,
our
position
is
nobody
had
scienter,
and
every
adjudicator
to
look
at
these
facts
--
judge
mott
in
the
district
court,
the
alj
of
the
sec,
has
found
that
there
was
no
scienter
anywhere
up
and
down
the
line.
so
the
fact
that
somebody
didn't
have
scienter
doesn't
answer
the
problem
here.
the
question--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--the
advisor
personnel
made
the
determination,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
policy
was
discretionary,
that
when
it
said
we
may
refuse
trades,
the
funds
may
refuse
trades,
that
there
are
discretion--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
sec--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--not
as
to
these
plaintiffs,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
kennedy,
you're
exactly
right.
that
is
the
theory
pleaded
in
the
complaint.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
and
the
question
that
is
before
this
court,
we
would
submit,
is
whether,
scienter
or
no
scienter,
jcm
can
be
held
liable
for
the
statements
in
another
company's
prospectus.
this
court
has
never
held--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--they
chose
not
to
bring
a
scheme
case.
and
remember,
there
is
a
second
set
of
investors
here:
the
fund
investors.
the
sec
brought
an
action,
secured
$100
million
on
behalf
of
them.
there
was
a
series
of
private
litigation
that
has
been
resolved,
brought
by
those
investors.
these
investors
did
not
purchase
the
securities
offered
by
the
--
the
prospectus
they
challenge.
and
again,
there's
a
fundamental
disconnect
between
the
defendant
in
the
case
and
the
challenge--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
for
different
reasons.
they
can
sue
jcm
for
--
for
an
omission,
because
there's
a
duty
that
runs
from
jcm
the
fund.
that
was
the
theory
advanced
in
that
separate
lawsuit
accepted
by
the
district
court,
which
has
since
been
resolved.
they
can't
--
these
plaintiffs
can't
bring
an
omission
case,
because
there
is
no
duty
that
runs
from
jcm
out
to
the
jcg
shareholders.
the
district
court
held
that.
they
didn't
appeal
that
to
the
fourth
circuit.
they
didn't
present
that
in
their
cert
petition.
so
they
can't
bring
that
omissions
case.
any
wrongdoing
in
this
case
--
justice
ginsburg,
to
finish
my
answer
to
your
question,
the
policy
says
funds
are
not
intended
for
market
timing.
the
advisor
allowed
12
traders
to
trade
frequently.
the
only
wrongdoing,
if
there
is
any
wrongdoing,
was
the
failure
of
the
advisor
to
disclose
to
the
trustees
the
deviation
from
the
policy.
that
is
a
state
law
breach
of
contract.
it
may
be
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
the
fund
made
the
statements
to
the
public.
they
were
drafted--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--they
were
drafted
by
lawyers
for
the
fund,
lawyers
representing
the
fund.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
the
advisor
paid
the
lawyers'
salaries.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
i
--
i
disagree
with
that,
justice
kagan.
they
don't
allege
that
in
the
complaint,
and
the
facts
show
that
the
lawyers--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--one
would
have
to--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--no,
your
honor.
one
would
have
to
further
look
at
who
those
lawyers
were
representing.
the
truth
in
the
real
world
is--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--every
prospectus
is
written
by
lawyers,
justice
kagan.
lawyers
write
prospectuses.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
in-house
counsel,
outside
counsel,
once
they
draft
materials
and
present
them
to
their
client,
it
becomes
the
client's
statement
when
adopted
by
the
client.
the
board
of
trustees
the
funds
has
to
review
every
policy,
is
responsible
for
every
policy
drafted,
by
inside
counsel,
outside
counsel,
consultants.
it's
not
unusual
for
companies
to
retain
outside
service
providers
to
provide
any
number
of
policies:
employment
policies,
investment
policies,
anything
else.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
like
all
lawyers,
they
wear
multiple
hats.
i
represent
multiple
clients.
these
lawyers
represent
multiple
clients.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
they
are
in-house
lawyers
at
jcm,
but
they
also
represent
the
funds,
and
the
sec
has
specifically
recognized
in
the
context
of
investment
companies
that
where
an
advisor
counsel
is
representing
the
funds,
his
client
or
her
client,
for
those
purposes,
is
the
funds.
and
here,
these
lawyers
are
very
careful
to
separate
who
their
--
their
clients
are
for
various
purposes.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
absolutely,
justice
kennedy,
because
when
the
statement
is
adopted
by
the
issuer,
it
becomes
the
issuer's
statement.
only
an
issuer
can
make
the
statement.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
that's--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
the
word
"control"
appears
more
than
a
hundred
times
in
the
briefs
on
the
plaintiff's
side
of
this
case
in
this
court,
and
the
congress
has
dealt
with
control.
section
20(a)
provides
a
separate
cause
of
action
against
those
who
control
another
entity.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
congress
has
dealt
with
the
situation
where
you
have
two
separate
companies
and
to
make
a
claim
against
the
second
company,
you
have
to
prove
control.
whether
or
not
they
could
in
this
case,
none
of
us
knows,
because
they
never
brought
that
claim.
they
represented
to
the
district
court--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
the
investment
company,
the
mutual
funds,
are
separately
owned,
separately
governed.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
well,
your
honor,
then
--
then
we're
just
saying
that
the
investment
advisor
is
a
service
provider
like
every
other
service
provider.
they
are
like
the--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
with
respect,
the
allegation
is
that
the
advisor
wrote
a
certain
policy,
but
the
very
document
cited
for
that
in
the
complaint
says
that
the
trustees
are
responsible
for
the
policies
of
the
funds.
the
trustees,
when
they
adopt
them,
it
becomes
the
corporate
policies
of
them.
i
mean,
on
the
plaintiff's--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--yes,
your
honor.
the
fund
has--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--are
the
officers
of
the
fund,
the
chief
executive
officer,
the
chief
financial
officer--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--not
the
president,
your
honor,
but
the
others
are
joint
--
serve
in
joint
capacities.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
the
lawyers
representing
the
trusts,
both
in-house
and
external,
draft
the
underlying
document--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--the
particular
prospectus,
answered
in
that
prospectus.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
they
are
presented
to
the
board
of
trustees,
which
holds
a
meeting.
the
board
of
trustees
is
--
the
funds
are
represented
by
outside
counsel
and
the
independent
trustees
are
represented
by
outside
counsel.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
these
particular
statements?
mr.
mark
a.
perry
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
changes
to
the
market
timing
policy
throughout
the
class
period.
in
fact,
earlier
in
the
class
period
there
was
a
disclosure
that
market
timing
might
be
permitted
pursuant
to
a
--
a
written
contract.
that
was
revised
later.
the
trustees
asked
multiple
questions.
they
were
back
and
forth
with
their
lawyers.
outside
counsel
was
always
involved,
and
there
were
other
consultants
involved
periodically
as
well.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
there
is
two
separate
sets
of
outside
counsel.
one
law
firm
represents
only
the
fund.
it
does
not
represent
the
advisor;
only
represents
the
funds,
your
honor.
there's
a
second
law
firm
in
this
case
that
represents
the
independent
trustees.
six
of
the
seven
trustees
determined
that
to
secure
their
independence,
because
the
chairman
of
the
board
at
that
time
was
an
interested
person
under
the
statute,
they
have
a
separate
law
firm.
there
are
two
law
firms
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
advisors.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
they
were
paid
by
jcm,
and
at
the
time
they
drafted,
they
were
representing
the
funds,
again,
as
allowed
by
the
sec,
as
disclosed
in
the
documents--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--those
outside
counsel
reviewed
every
policy.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--the
--
the
paragraph
being
challenged
in
this
case,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
interrogatory
response
doesn't
speak
more
broadly
than
that,
but
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
correct,
your
honor.
and
then
the
trust,
of
course,
has
contractual
and
other
rights
against
the
advisor
that
it
has
enforced,
you
know,
in
this
very
case.
the
trustees
made
a
claim
against
the
advisor
for
all
of
this
underlying
conduct.
except--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--if
he's
an
authorized
agent
of
the
same
company
that
issued
the
statement?
mr.
mark
a.
perry
if
the
board
of
trustees
of
his
company,
so
that
the
statement--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--and
the
distinction
here,
justice
breyer,
is--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--if
he
is
an
authorized
agent,
he
may
be
sued
as--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--he
may
be
subject
to
liability,
then.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
they
run
the
management
of
the
fund.
the
investment
of--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--because
the
corporate
form
has
meaning
in
the
federal
law
and
in
state
law,
and
where--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--the
answer
is,
your
honor:
these
funds
are
managed
--
governed,
excuse
me,
is
a
better
word
--
by
the
trustees.
that
is
disclosed
in
these
documents.
in
fact,
the
documents
say
--
it's
at
page
258a
of
the
joint
appendix
--
the
trustees
are
responsible
for
all
the
policies.
they
have
outsourced,
if
you
will,
certain
functions,
operational
functions:
which
stock
to
buy,
which
stock
to
sell,
which
transfer
agent
to
hire.
those
are
functions
that
could
be
kept
in
house,
but
could
be--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--that
govern
everything.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
well,
they're
--
they're--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--three
answers.
first,
as
dealt
with
in
section
20(b),
which
is
the
ventriloquist
dummy
statute
that
these
plaintiffs
didn't
invoke.
second,
the
congress
looked
at
this
very
question
in
1938
and
1939,
when
there
were
proposals
to
merge
the
management,
the
advisor
function,
with
the
funds,
to
make
them
one
unitary
entity.
in
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
and
the
investment
advisors
act
of
1940
the
congress
elected
not
do
that.
as
this
court
has
recognized,
it
chose
not
to
require
compulsorily
internalization
of
the
management
function.
it
allowed
this
separate
entity.
and
therefore,
when
you
have
separate
companies,
under
state
law
--
again,
my
client
is
a
delaware
limited
liability
corporation.
the
funds
are
massachusetts
business
trusts.
they
have
nothing
in
common.
there's
no
joint
ownership,
no
joint
governance--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--absolutely
not.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
and
every
fund,
or
virtually
every
fund
in
--
in
the
united
states,
is
set
up
this
way.
and
again--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--my
third--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--my
third
answer
is
that
extensive
regulatory
involvement
in
the
two
acts
enacted
in
1940
specifically
to
regulate
this
industry,
that
congress
never
made
the
decision
to
hold
the
advisor
liable
for
the
fund's
conduct.
in
fact,
no
statute
says
that,
and
the
sec
has
never
taken
that
position.
there
is
no
case
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs
--
they
have
234
pages,
138
cases.
not
one
holds
an
investment
advisor
liable
for
statements
of
the
fund's
prospectuses.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
the
company
may
be
sued
under
10b-5.
it
has
got
to
meet
all
the
elements.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
but
yes,
it
is
an
authorized
agent
making
a
statement
on
behalf
of
the
company.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
absolutely
right,
your
honor,
and
that's
a
distinction--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--it's
grounded
in
state
law,
and
it
differs
between
one
company
and
two
companies.
where
congress
has
looked
at
issuers,
for
example--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--you
know,
for
certain
purposes,
justice
scalia,
they
are
an
agent.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
no,
your
honor,
for
--
not
for
drafting
a
prospectus.
for
carrying
out
the
investment
function.
they
are
laid
out
in
the
contract--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--it's
attached
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
which
sets
forth
the
things
that
jcm
is
an
agent
for
investment
operations,
not
an
agent
specifically
for
registering
the
fund's
securities
for
sales,
complying
with
the
federal
securities
laws,
preparing
and
issuing
the
prospectus.
all
those
things,
by
contrast--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--they
did
not
do
those
things,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
no,
it's
not
the
allegation.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
i
don't
know
how
to
respond
to
that,
justice
kennedy,
since
it's
so
far
beyond
what
they
could
possibly
prove
here.
what
happened
here--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
and,
your
honor,
no
court,
no
case
from
this
court
or
any
court
of
appeals
has
ever
held
that
the
driver's
seat
exception,
the
central
bank,
exists.
and
that
is
an
expansion.
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
of
course,
which
is
attribution:
even
if
there
is
making
by
jcm,
none
of
these
statements
were
attributed
to
jcm.
the
prospectus
is
very
clear
that
at
issue--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--justice
ginsburg,
the
fourth
circuit's
view
was
the
manager
helps
the
fund.
that
--
nobody
even
defends
the
fourth
circuit's
ruling.
the
government
now
comes
in
with
a
theory
that
they
admit,
on
page
22
of
the
government's
brief,
does
apply
to
every
lawyer,
every
accountant,
every--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--absolutely,
justice
scalia.
and
that
question
can
only
be--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--we
agree
with
the
court.
the
question
presented
can
only
be
answered
one
way:
the
court
of
appeals
erred.
if
i
may
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
kennedy,
in
response
to
your
attribution
question,
mr.
gannon
said
something
about
falsely
attributed
or
anonymous
statements.
we
have
neither
here.
we
have
a
correctly
attributed,
nonanonymous
prospectus
that
under
federal
law
says
on
the
first
page
of
the
document
who
it's
attributed
to,
the
janus
funds,
who
have
their
own
trustees.
justice
ginsburg,
who
is
in
the
driver's
seat?
page
258a
of
the
joint
appendix,
quote:
"the
trustees
are
responsible
for
major
decisions
relating
to
each
fund's
objectives,
policies
and
techniques.
"
"the
trustees
also
supervise
the
operations
of
the
fund
by
their
officers
and
review
the
investment
decisions
of
the
officers.
"
there
is
no
misdirection
here
about
who
is
in
charge.
the
trustees
are
in
charge.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
if
it
is
a
dupe
case,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
sotomayor,
it's
dealt
with
by
20(b),
which
justice
--
mr.
gannon
did
not
answer.
you
notice
20(b)
does
not
require
a
primary
violation.
it
allows
the
commission
to
proceed
directly
against
any
person
who
acts
indirectly
where
it
can't
act
directly.
so
20(b)
answers
this
problem.
the
commission
also
--
the
34b
of
the
investment
company
act
is
broader.
there's
also
section
206
and
215
of
the
investment
advisors
act
which
regulate
the
conduct
of
investment
advisors.
congress
has
dealt
in
a
very
reticulated
way,
and
all
of
the
questions
today
i
would
submit
show
the
absence
of
bright
lines
being
proposed
by
my
friends
on
this
side
of
the
table.
they
can't
articulate
the
difference
between
primary
and
secondary,
between
principal
and
agent,
between
aiders
and
abettors
and
anything
else.
this
is
an
area
that
needs
bright
lines,
it
needs
to
be
resolved
on
motions
to
dismiss.
scienter
can't
be
resolved
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
and
the
congress,
in
the
dodd-frank
act,
which
the
plaintiffs
said
in
their
opposition
in
this
court
to
this
certiorari
petition,
was
going
to
solve
the
problem
by
enacting
a
statute
--
turns
out
congress
didn't
enact
that
statute.
instead,
congress
referred
this
issue
to
the
general
accounting
office,
to
the
controller
general,
and
said
take
a
year,
take
all
the
resources
of
the
federal
government,
study
the
problem
of
the
distinction
between
companies
that
issue
securities
on
the
one
hand,
--
the
funds
here
--
and
those
who
provide
services
on
the
other
hand
--
the
advisor
here.
and
tell
us,
come
back
to
the
congress
and
tell
us
whether
we
need
to
solve
the
problem.
if
the
government--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--the
investors
in
the
mutual
fund,
justice
alito--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--got
$100
million
through
the
sec
action
and
resolved
all
the
civil
litigation.
they're
a
separate
class
of
investors,
whole
different
set
of
securities
laws
problems,
because
they
were
the
recipients
of
the
prospectus
that
offered
these
securities
and
that
contained
the
false
statements.
these
plaintiffs'
foundation
problem,
they
didn't
purchase
or
sell
the
securities
that
were
offered
by
the
prospectus
they
complain
about.
they
can't
find
any
false
statements--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--these
shareholders
--
jcg's
shareholders
have
no
relief.
and
justice
kagan,
i
would
point
out
in
the
70
years
since
the
investment
company
act
was
enacted
and
the
modern
mutual
fund
industry
was
built,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
--
and
they
certainly
haven't
cited
one
--
in
which
the
investors
in
the
parent
company
have
ever
recovered
a
dime
in
an
sec
action,
a
private
action
or
otherwise,
for
statements
in
the
fund's
prospectuses.
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
line
between
corporate
entities,
and
the
liability
runs
up
different
channels.
this
is
a
totally
novel,
unprecedented
theory
that
they're
presenting.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
right.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
their
theory
was
that
there
was
an
omission,
that
the
advisor
owned
a
duty
to
the
fund.
the
statements
were
correctly
made,
justice
ginsburg.
there
was
no
market
timing.
when
the
advisor
later
allowed
certain
traders
in,
it
owed
a
duty
to
correct
the
statements
to
the
fund.
that
was
the
liability
theory
of
the
investors.
these
plaintiffs
can't
pursue
that
liability
theory
because
the
duty
doesn't
run
the
other
way,
it
doesn't
run
from
jcm
to
jcg's
investors,
that's
the
law
in
this
case.
therefore,
they
can't
bring
an
omissions
case,
they
have
to
bring
an
affirmative
misstatements
case
for
statements
that
were
not
directed
to
this
group
of
investors.
