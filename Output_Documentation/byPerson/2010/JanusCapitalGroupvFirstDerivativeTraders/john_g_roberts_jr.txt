chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-525,
janus
capital
group
v.
first
derivative
traders.
mr.
perry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
outside
counsel
you're
talking
about
represent
the
fund
only?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
if
the
lawyers
for
the
trust
did
an
inadequate
job
of
reviewing
the
jcm
drafts,
they
would
be
subject
to
a
malpractice
action
by
the
trust?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
can
--
i'm
sorry.
please--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--except
--
except
when
they
review
material
going
in
the
prospectus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
they
have
independent
representation
by
outside
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
--
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
the
outside
counsel
reviews
what
the
policy
is
going
to
be?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
our
question
is
the
validity
of
that
statement,
whether
that's
deceptive
in
the
prospectus.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
an
entirely
different
question.
i
understood
your
theory
of
the
case
to
be
that
jcm
is
liable,
basically,
because
they
put
it
in
the
prospectus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
the
question,
i
guess,
that
--
your
response
seems
to
beg
the
question
--
is
that
they
falsely
represented.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
something
happened
between
their
drafting
and
its
appearance
in
the
prospectus.
that
makes
it
appropriate
to
say
that
that's
a
statement
of
the
trust
rather
than
a
statement
of
jcm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt,
but
it
seems
be
an
important
--
when
they
issued
the
prospectus?
who
issued
the
prospectus?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
sec
has
recognized
that
they
remain
two
separate
entities,
despite
the
interconnected
relationship.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
one
activity
--
one
activity
that
we
know
they
did
not
outsource
was
review
of
the
materials
submitted
by
jcm.
they
had
independent
counsel
that
conducted
that
review.
would
it
have
been
a
breach
of
the
trustees'
fiduciary
obligations
to
the
fund
investors
under
common
law
--
i
forget
where
this
is
incorporated
--
to
rubberstamp
what
they
get
from
somebody
on
the
outside,
not
to
have
independent
counsel
review
what
they're
going
to
say
in
their
prospectus?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that,
again,
what
has
been
conceded:
that
there
may
well
be
an
action
from
the
fund
represented
by
their
trustees
against--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--except,
except
to
the
sec,
right?
because
they
can
pursue
it
under
aiding
and
abetting.
it's
kind
of
a
big--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--problem
if
you're
trying
to
say
we're
safe
from
the
actions
for
security
fraud.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
you
were
just
responding
by
saying
the
problem
is
that
this
will
give
people
a
road
map.
but
they're
going
to
hit
a
pretty
big
bump
in
the
road
when
the
sec
brings
an
action
against
them,
including
potential
criminal
actions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
sec--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
just
to
get--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
get
back,
so
you
are
conceding
that
if
you
lose
this
case,
you
will
be
unable
to
bring
any
aiding
and
abetting
case
in
a
situation
such
as
this?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
like
a
yes
or
no
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gannon.
mr.
perry,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
perry.
the
case
is
submitted.
