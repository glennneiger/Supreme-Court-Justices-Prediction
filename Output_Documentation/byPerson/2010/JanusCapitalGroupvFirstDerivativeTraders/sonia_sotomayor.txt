justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
is
--
who
is
the
violator
alleged
here?
not
in
the
complaint,
but
in
the
briefs?
as
i
read
the
briefs,
they
claim
that
janus
itself
did
not
make
the
false
statement,
that
the
two
appellants
did,
that
they
are
the
actual
speakers
because
they
were
talking
about
their
activities,
and
they
used
janus
as
a
conduit
to
deceive
the
market.
that's,
i
think,
what
they're
alleging.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
we
sustain
the
intermediary
cases
when
the
company,
through
market
analysts,
divulges
misleading
statements?
we
don't
talk
about
the
market
analysts'
falsity;
we
talk
about
the
company's
falsity,
because
the
market
analysts
didn't
have
scienter.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
what's
the
difference
between
an
omission
or
a
commission
if
a
company
purposely
divulges
a
falsehood
to
an
analyst,
knowing
it's
going
to
be
distributed
and
told?
so
who
is
making
the
false
statement,
the
analyst
or
the
company?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
--
why
aren't
the
two
appellants,
on
their
theory,
on
--
we
can
talk
about
whether
the
complaint
does
or
does
not
adequately
allege
their
theory.
that's
a
different
issue.
i
accept
that.
but
under
their
theory,
why
isn't
the
appellants
the
primary
violator,
not
even
a
secondary?
because
they
--
they
claim,
i
think
--
and
i'm
going
to
find
out
from
them
--
that
janus
had
no
scienter,
that
it
didn't
make
the
false
statements,
that
all
of
this
was
done
in
secret
by
the
appellants,
so
they
were
the
only
violator.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
mean
to
say
to
me
that
puppets
become
a
legal
defense
for
someone
who
intentionally
manipulates
the
market
information?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
control
person
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i
--
but
if
janus
had
no
scienter,
if
its
board
of
directors
did
not
know
that
the
statements
were
false,
they
had
no
way
of
knowing,
because
as
i
understand
the
complaint,
and
this
is
alleged,
the
deal
was
secret.
so
janus
itself
could
not
be
a
primary
violator.
who
is?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
though
there
was
no
scheme
with
another
actor?
even
though
it
was
the
only
violator,
which
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
complaint?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
except
that
i,
as
i
read
your
brief,
and
you
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
you
were
arguing
that
since
there
was
an
independent
board
of
directors,
presumably
because
there
are
two
corporate
--
different
corporate
funds
--
two
different
corporate
forms,
that
there
couldn't
be
control
person
liability
under
20(a).
you
seem
that
--
i
thought,
reading
your
brief,
that's
what
you
were
alleging.
so
you
can't
have
your
cake
and
eat
it,
too.
either
the
independence
of
the
board
makes
no
difference
or
it
does,
so
which
is
your
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
what
theory
would
you
defend
an
allegation
that
the
investment
manager
who
had
control
over
the
everyday
affairs
of
the
company,
drafted
or
helped
draft
the
prospectus,
hired
the
lawyers
who
helped
draft
it,
wouldn't
be
a
control
person?
how
would
you
defend
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
so
you
--
you're
--
if
they
can't
be
control
persons
because
they're
separate
companies,
then
how
do
they
escape
being
primary
violators?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it's
not
in
this
case,
because
the
allegation
is
that
it
--
not
the
company,
that
it
chose
to
deceive
the
market.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
--
you're
not
suggesting,
are
you,
that
they
did
this
for
purposes
of
protecting
your
client
from
lawsuit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
it
--
no,
they
did
it
for
a
business
reason,
that
having
separate
entities
was
economically
more
useful
for
the
market,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
--
but
that
doesn't
answer
justice
breyer's
question,
now.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assuming
that
they
didn't
do
it
for
that
reason,
what
does
it
mean?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
your
claim
premised
on
janus
being
duped
or
not?
if
janus
was
not
duped,
if
its
board
knew
and
jcm
was
doing
the
activity
with
either
the
consent
or
acquiescence
of
the
board,
would
you
have
a
claim
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
because
i
can
see
when
there's
one
primary
violator
who
uses
another
entity
as
a
dupe
or
as
a
puppet,
but
i
can't,
and
i
don't
know
how
to
distinguish
what
you're
proposing,
from
aiding
and
abetting.
there
has
to
be
something
to
differentiate
the
two,
so
what
is
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
could
you
start
by
taking
your
brief
and
distilling
it
down
to
three
sentences?
define
what
a
primary
violator
is,
what
a
secondary
violator
is
who
aids
and
abets,
and
who
a
control
person
is?
and
then
tell
me
how
that
definition
would
exclude
lawyers,
auditors,
investment
--
general
investment
advisors,
et
cetera.
i've
read
your
brief,
but
i've
been
trying
to
distill
it
down
to
three
sentences.
so
try
to
do
that
for
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
give
me
an
example
of
that.
what
do
you
see
as
all
of
the
elements?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
understand.
but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
that
becomes
--
how
is
that
different
from
aiding
and
abetting
the
making
of
a
statement?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
every
lawyer--
--who
writes
the
false
statement
knowing
it's
false.
so,
are
you
saying
every
lawyer
who
writes
the
statement
knowing
that
it's
false
is
a
primary--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
could
you
have
--
you
just
admitted
if
there
--
if
the
company
was
duped,
you
couldn't
have
aiding
and
abetting
liability.
could
you
impose
a
20(b)
or
20(b)
control
person
liability?
