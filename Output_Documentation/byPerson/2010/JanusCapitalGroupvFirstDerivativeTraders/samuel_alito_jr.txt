justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
this
case
didn't
involve
a
mutual
fund.
suppose
it
involved
a
corporation
with
thousands
of
employees
and
the
prospectus
is
drafted
by
outside
counsel.
it's
adopted
by
the
directors
of
the
company
without
changing
a
word.
now,
would
that
case
come
out
the
same?
and
if
not,
what
would
--
what
exactly
would
you
have
us
say
to
distinguish
the
two?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
it's
alleged
they
knew
exactly
what
was
going
on?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
are
aiders
and
abettors?
i
thought
there
wasn't
aiding
and
abetting.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
distinction
you're
drawing
is
between
making
the
statement
and
assisting
in
making
the
statement.
isn't
that
what
you
just
said?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
aiding
and
abetting
is
assisting
in
making
these
statements
as
if
--
as
in
something
you
want
to
take
place,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
difference,
the
distinction
in
--
in
this
context?
one
possible
distinction
is
who
formally
makes
it,
in
whose
name
is
it
made,
but
that's
obviously
not
your
--
your
position.
so
what
is
it
to
distinguish
a
principal
here
from
an
aider
and
abettor?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
still
not
clear
what
your
distinction
is
between
making
the
statement
and
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
making
of
the
statement.
now,
could
you
explain
that
for
me?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
necessary
that
the
person
in
whose
--
the
entity
in
whose
name
the
statement
is
made
is
an
empty
shell,
it's
simply
a
puppet
that's
controlled
by
somebody
else?
is
that
--
is
that
necessary
or
does
it
go
beyond
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
just
to
sum
up,
if
there
are
--
if
investors
in
a
mutual
fund
are
duped
by
a
false
statement
that
is
made
in
fact,
is
written
by
--
by
the
management
company
and
issued
by
the
fund
without
knowledge
of
its
falsity,
is
there
anyplace
they
can
get
--
look
to
for
relief?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
the
mutual
fund,
yes.
