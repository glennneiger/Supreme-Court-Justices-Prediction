--can
be

--
common
reliance
can
be

stage?

the

can
the
basic
presumption
be
rebutted
at
the
certification
stage?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
it
be
rebutted
by
proof
other
than
proof
generally
disproving
the
efficiency
of
the
market?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
is
that
based
on,
the
footnote
in
basic?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
pretty
thin,
isn't
it?
it's
a
--
it's
dictum
in
a
footnote
in
an
opinion
issued
at
a
time
when
conditional
class
certification
was
permitted.
do
you
have
anything
else
to
support
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
have
anything
in
the
rule
to
support
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
say
to
--
to
the
following
argument,
that
there
are
some
economists
who
say
that,
even
in
a
market
that
is
generally
efficient,
there
can
be
instances
in
which
the
market
does
not
incorporate
certain
statements
into
the
price
of
a
stock;
and
therefore
even
when
it
is
demonstrated
that
the
market
meets
the
test
for
efficiency
that
the
lower
courts
have
settled
upon
in
the
wake
of
basic,
the
defendant
in
a
--
in
a
class
action
where
there
is
reliance
on
the
basic
presumption
should
be
permitted
at
the
class
certification
stage
to
prove
that
the
allegedly
fraudulent
statements
had
no
impact
on
price,
and
by
doing
that
destroy
the
theory
that
the
class
relied
on
the
statements,
because
they
relied
on
the
price
which
incorporated
the
statements?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
seem
to
--
maybe
i
don't
understand
your
argument,
but
you
and
mr.
boies
seem
to
be
arguing
that
whether
there
is
a
common
question
--
that
it
is
a
common
question
whether
there
is
a
common
question,
and
therefore
that
has
to
wait
until
the
merits
stage.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
they
show
that
the
statement
was
not
incorporated
in
the
price,
in
the
price,
and
they're
not
claiming
that
they
relied,
that
every
member
of
the
class
actually
relied
on
the
statement,
they're
all
claiming
they
relied
on
the
price
--
if
they
show
that
the
statement
wasn't
incorporated
in
the
price,
then
why
doesn't
reliance
cease
to
be
a
common
issue
and
become
a
question
of
an
individual
issue
that
would
have
to
be
proved
by
each,
each
member
of
the
class?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yeah,
but
the
fact
that
they
would
lose
on
the
merits
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
they
are
entitled
to
class
certification.
