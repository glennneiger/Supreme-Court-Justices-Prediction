ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
circuit
erred
in
requiring
proof
of
loss
causation
at
class
certification
for
three
reasons:
first,
it's
conducting
a
merits
inquiry
that's
not
tethered
to
the
rule
23
requirements;
second,
it's
taking
a
presumption
and
requiring
plaintiffs
to
prove
it;
and
third,
it's
confusing
the
distinct
elements
of
reliance
and
loss
causation.
just
to
start
in
with
some
of
the
court's
questions:
first,
justice
scalia's:
does
the
court
require
proof
of
loss
causation?
the
fifth
circuit
could
not
be
more
clear.
it
is
not
talking
about
rebutting
the
presumption
of
reliance,
giving
the
defendants
an
opportunity
to
do
that
at
class
certification.
it
is
putting
an
affirmative
burden
on
plaintiffs
that
they
have
to
meet
in
every
single
case,
even
if
the
defendants
do
not
come
to
court
with
any
evidence.
and
that
is
a
very
heavy
burden,
as
the
district
court
in
this
case
realized.
and
just
to
make
this
as
concrete
as
possible,
loss
causation
is
the
question
at
the
end
of
the
day,
whether
the
price
decline
that
caused
the
losses
was
sufficiently
related
to
the
earlier
alleged
material
misstatement
and
whether
there
was
any
other
cause
that
could
have
led
to
the
price
decline.
so
if
a
plaintiff
cannot
come
in
and
prove
loss
causation,
there
could
be
many
reasons
for
that.
it
may
be
because
the
market
is
not
efficient.
it
could
also
be
because
there's
no
material
misstatement.
but
it
could
also
be,
as
this
court
recognized
in
dura,
that
there
was
a
material
misstatement,
it
did
inflate
the
stock
price,
but
then
other
causes
such
as
a
bad
economy
or
other
news
about
the
company
came
along,
and
that's
what
caused
the
stock
price
to
drop.
justice--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
that's
certainly
what
the
court
suggested
in
basic
and
what
the
courts
of
appeals
have
done,
is
to
say
that
that's
a
threshold
showing
that
is
sufficiently
collateral
to
the
merits
that
it
needs
to
be
made,
so
that
the
presumption
can
be
invoked
in
the
first
instance.
but
these
ideas
about
rebutting
the
presumption
by
showing
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
plaintiff
can't
prove
its
case,
these
are
things,
as
mr.
boies
said,
that
stand
or
fall
on
a
class-wide
basis.
and
the
real
problem
with
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
is
that
it
did
not
tie
its
proof
of
loss
causation
to
the
requirements
of
rule
23.
everyone
agrees
here
that
loss
causation
stands
or
falls
on
a
class-wide
basis.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
that's
what
rule
23,
23(b)(3),
which
is
the
one
at
issue
here
--
the
question
is
do
common
issues
predominate
over
individual
ones.
what
you're
trying
to
answer
is
can
this
group
of
people
proceed
together,
not
can
this
group
of
people
make
out
their
case.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
then
i
think
the
plaintiff
should
lose
at
the
12(b)(6)
stage,
and
that
is
a
stage
that
has
real
bite
after
this
court's
decision
in
dura
and
after
the
pslra.
there
are
heightened
pleading
requirements
that
apply.
there
are
plaintiffs
that
will
lose
at
summary
judgment
on
the
issue
of
loss
causation,
for
example,
because,
a,
either
they
don't
allege
a
price
drop,
b,
they
don't
connect
the
price
drop
to
the
earlier
distortion
of
the
market
when
there's
a
material
misstatement.
there
can
be
many
reasons
that
they
lose
at
that
merits
stage,
but
class
certification
is
not
a
merits
stage,
and
the
fifth
circuit
made
it
one
because
of
its
own
policy
judgments
about
the
effects
of
class
certification.
and
with
all
due
respect
to
the
fifth
circuit,
it's
just
not
that
court's
judgment
to
make
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that's
right.
you're
asking
is
this
theory
going
to
be
available
to
the
plaintiffs
at
trial,
and
the
way
that
the
plaintiffs
show
that
the
theory
is
available
to
them
is
by
establishing
an
efficient
market
and
saying
that
they
traded
within
the
time
period
while
the
price
was
distorted.
it's
just
like
establishing
any
other
threshold
inquiry
that
would
make
evidence
or
a
legal
theory
available
at
trial.
but
the
question
the
court
is
supposed
to
be
asking
at
the
23,
at
the
rule
23
stage,
the
class
certification
stage,
is
not
can
these
people
win
on
the
merits.
and
that's
a
question
the
fifth
circuit
was
asking.
the
question
it's
supposed
to
ask
is
can
this
group
of
people
proceed
together.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no,
that's
not
what
we're
saying.
what
we're
saying
is
when
common
issues
predominate
on
the
issue
of
reliance,
and
when
the
petitioners
--
or
when
the
plaintiffs
invoke
fraud
on
the
market
and
they
show
that
there
is
an
efficient
market,
this
court
said
in
basic,
they
can
all
proceed
together
because
they
are
showing
that
the
price
--
that
the
material
misstatement
was
reflected
in
the
stock
price.
this
is
an
impersonal
market
in
which
you
rely
on
the
stock
price.
they
all
rely
on
it
in
the
same
way.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
in
that
circumstance
reliance
ceases
to
be
and
the
case
cannot
be
established
on
the
merits.
they
stand
or
fall
together
on
the
merits.
their
theory
is
the
same
for
all
of
them.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
right.
they're
entitled
to
class
certification
if
they
have
a
common
issue.
and
what
the
court
said
in
basic
is
that
if
they
set
out
the
prerequisites
for
the
fraud
on
the
market,
which
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
were
met
in
this
case,
that
they
could
proceed
together.
that
threshold
showing
is
required.
justice
kagan,
i
take
your
point
that
there
is
--
that
even
the
question
of
whether
the
market
is
efficient
is
a
common
one,
so
perhaps
one
could
logically
say:
well,
they
have
a
common
issue
on
the
efficiency
of
the
market;
why
should
they
even
have
to
show
that
at
class
certification?
but
this
court
said
in
basic,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said,
it's
reasonable
in
that
case
since
it's
so
divorced
from
the
merits
to
require
a
threshold
showing
to
even
allow
them
to
invoke
the
presumption
at
the
outset.
but
that
is
very,
very
different
from
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
this
case.
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
said
basically:
prove
your
whole
case.
you
don't
just
have
to
prove
that
there
was
a
price
decrease;
you
have
to
prove
that
there
was
an
initial
material
misstatement,
that
it
distorted
the
stock
price,
that
it
led
to
a
price
decrease
and
that
the
price
decrease
can't
be,
can't
be
shown
by
any
other
superseding
cause.
it's
essentially,
as
the
seventh
circuit
said--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no.
the
court
said--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--this
court
said
in
basic
that
in
order
to
establish
the
presumption
that
you
need
to
show
the
efficiency
of
the
market,
the
trading
during
the
relevant
time
period.
i
agree
with
you
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
with
respect,
just
alleging
that
the
market
went
down
would
not
be
enough
to
show
that
there
was
an
initial
price
distortion
because
of
the
company's
material
misstatement.
stock
prices
can
go
down
for
any
number
of
reasons.
there's
a
significant
linkage
that's
required
between
the
initial
material
misstatement
and
the
eventual
loss.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
certainly
in
the
courts
of
appeals
now,
that's
not
the
way
the
plaintiffs
proceed.
the
way
they
proceed
is
on
the
basic
theory.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
don't
think
that
that's--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i
mean,
if
you
--
if
you
would
like
to
--
if
you
would
like
to
expand
even
beyond
basic
and
allow
class
certification.
but
the
courts
of
appeals
have
used
basic
for
20
years,
congress
is
well
aware
of
it
and
has
not
seen
fit
to
change
it.
this
is
the
way
that
these
cases
proceed.
this
court
at
the
time
of
basic
recognized
that
every
court
of
appeals
had
thought
that
it
made
sense
to
proceed
in
that
way,
using
the
fraud
on
the
market
theory.
this
is
well
established.
and
just
to
be
clear,
respondents
never
suggested
in
this
case
that
basic
should
be
revisited.
this
is
not
an
issue
that
the
courts
below
considered.
this
is
not
an
issue
that
was
fully
briefed,
and
it's
not
something
that
we
think
should
be
considered.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
took
it
upon
itself
to
tighten
the
rule
23
requirements.
it
was
not
satisfied
with
the
rules
as
they
exist,
and
it
took
the
class
certification
stage
and
turned
it
into
a
merits
inquiry
stage.
they
required
plaintiffs
to
prove
almost
their
entire
case
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation,
and
that
just
wasn't
right,
because
the
class
certification
stage
--
can
i
finish
this
--
is
about
whether
plaintiffs
can
proceed
as
a
group
together,
as
the
court
in
amchem
said
they
often
can
in
securities
fraud
actions.
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
