mr.
boies,
how
would
it
work
in
your
view
of
the
case?
that
is,
you
say
that
the
loss,
what's
been
called
loss
causation,
is
not
something
to
be
decided
at
the
certification
stage,
but
at
the
trial
or
summary
judgment.
well,
how
--
how
would
the
plaintiff
class
prove
loss
causation?
given
the
reliance
hurdle
that
you
have
surmounted,
now
you're
in
--
you
have
your
class
certified;
how
does
the
class
prove
loss
causation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
way
the
fifth
circuit
wrote
the
decision,
the
fifth
circuit
seems
to
be
saying:
plaintiffs,
you
didn't
show
an
initially
false
representation;
and
you,
you
plaintiff,
didn't
show
a
--
a
corrective
statement
that
caused
a
price
drop.
as
i
read
the
fifth
circuit's
decision,
it
says:
plaintiff,
you
failed
to
prove
one
of
the
two
things
that
you
would
have
to
prove.
and
you
say:
no,
they
really
put
the
burden
on
--
on
defendants,
fifth
circuit
put
the
burden
on
defendant
and
found
that
defendant
had
met
it
instead
of
the
other
way
around?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
--
your
argument
seems
to
say,
to
--
to
get
a
class
certified
you
have
to
virtually
prove
your
case
on
the
merits.
you
--
you
leave
almost
nothing
over.
i
mean,
if
you've
won
the
class
action
certification
on
your
basis
and
you've
shown
the
material
misleading
and
the
price
dropped
as
a
consequence,
the
efficient
market
first
--
you've
shown
all
that,
what
else
is
left
on
the
merits?
you
win
on
the
merits
if
you
win
certification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
only
requirement
we're
talking
about
is
(b)(3)
because
it's
--
it's
not
argued
and
the
district
court
found
that
all
of
the
23(a)
requirements
were
satisfied.
that's
not
the
particular--
