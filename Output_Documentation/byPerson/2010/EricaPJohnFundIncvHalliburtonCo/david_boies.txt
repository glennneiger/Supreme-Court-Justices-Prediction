mr.
david
boies
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
district
court
below
found,
and
it
is
not
disputed
here,
that
the
plaintiff
fulfilled
all
of
the
requirements
of
rule
23(a)
for
class
certification.
the
district
court
also
found,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
that
the
plaintiffs
demonstrated
all
of
the
requirements
for
class
certification
under
23(b)(3)
except
for
the
fifth
circuit's
loss
causation
requirement.
the
court
below
recognized
that
whether
or
not
there
was
an
efficient
market
was
not
disputed.
it
was
conceded
that
we
have
an
efficient
market
here.
there
were
no
challenges--
mr.
david
boies
--certainly.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
david
boies
--because
the
issue
of
efficient
market
goes
to
the
presumption
of
reliance,
and
if
the
court
holds
at
the
certification
stage
that
there
is
no
efficient
market,
then
the
basis
for
presuming
class-wide
reliance
is
impacted.
and
so
you
can
have
a
situation
in
which
the
common
issues
do
not
predominate
over
the
individualized
issues.
that
cannot
happen
with
respect
to
loss
causation
because,
as
respondent
concedes
here,
loss
causation
is
a
common
issue.
mr.
david
boies
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
you
can
rebut
materiality
at
the
--
at
the
certification
stage.
i
would
note
that
under
the
fifth
circuit
rule,
loss
causation
is
in
addition
to
materiality.
mr.
david
boies
because
the
issue
of
materiality
is
something
that
goes
to
a
class-wide
common
issue.
the
issue
of
reliance
can
go
to
whether
or
not
issues
predominate
or
not.
rule
23(b)(3)
talks
about
whether
common
issues
predominate
or
not.
that's
the
issue
at
class
certification
stage.
the
merits
issue
is
not
implicated
at
class
certification--
mr.
david
boies
--under
rule
23--
mr.
david
boies
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
david
boies
the
basic
presumption
of
reliance,
yes,
your
honor.
for
example,
if
you
were
to
take
a
situation
in
which
you
--
not
present
here,
but
where
you
disputed
whether
or
not
the
market
was
efficient
or
not,
that
is
something
that
could
be
decided
at
the
class
certification
stage.
mr.
david
boies
we
believe
under
the
court's
decision
in
basic
that
that
is
something
that
is
reserved
for
trial,
that
--
that
rebuttal.
mr.
david
boies
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
boies
i
don't
from
this
court,
your
honor.
mr.
david
boies
anything
in
the
rule?
mr.
david
boies
well,
i
think
the
--
i
think
what
the
rule
does
is
it
talks
about
whether
issues
of
common
issue
predominate
over
individualized
issue.
and
since
this
is
something
that
would
be
at
the
class
certification
stage,
not
creating
individualized
issues,
we
would
think
that
is
something
that's
reserved
for
trial.
mr.
david
boies
as
--
as
this
court
indicated
in
dura,
in
order
to
prove
loss
causation,
you
must
demonstrate
that
you
had
either
an
increase
in
the
prices,
and
this
--
this
assumes
that
you
are
concealing
negative
information;
the
reverse
would
be
true
if
you
were
concealing
positive
information
--
an
increase
at
the
time
that
the
concealment
took
place
or
a
decline
when
the
actual
facts
were
revealed.
and
it
would
be
required
at
summary
judgment
by
a
summary
judgment
standard,
and
at
trial
by
a
trial
standard,
and
at
the
pleading
stage
by
a
pleading
standard,
for
the
plaintiff
to
make
out
that
case.
in
other
words,
there
are
three
times
loss
causation
is
tested:
pleadings,
summary
judgment,
and
trial.
the
question
is
whether
a
fourth
test
should
be
interposed
at
the
class
certification
stage.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
could.
i
think
that
you
--
you
could
very
well
have
a
situation
in
which
if
you
demonstrated
a
lack
of
response,
that
could
impact
the
issue
of
efficiency;
and
i
think
that
would
be
an
issue
that
--
that
in
a
proper
case
where
unlike
this
one
it
was
presented--
mr.
david
boies
--the
--
the
problem
is,
as
the
fifth
circuit
noted
at
page
335
of
the
f.
3d
report,
efficiency
of
this
market
was
conceded
below.
in
other
words,
the
respondents
conceded
that
this
market
was
efficient?
so
that
issue
--
that
issue
was
not
presented,
and
the
rebuttal
issue
was
not
--
was
not
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
david
boies
well,
it
depends
on
how
the
fifth
circuit
then
construes
reliance.
mr.
david
boies
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
they
simply
changed
the
wording
and
called
loss
causation
reliance,
obviously
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
but
as
this
court
indicated
in
basic,
and
just
last
month
in
matrixx,
loss
causation
and
reliance
are
two
distinct
elements.
and
the
reason
that's
important
in
this
particular
context
is
that
reliance
can
create
a
situation
where
you
have
individualized
issues
predominating
over
common
issues.
loss
causation
can't
because,
as
respondents
concede
here,
loss
causation
is
a
class-wide
issue.
either
--
there
either
is
loss
causation
or
is
not
loss
causation.
that,
as
this
court
held
in
dura,
is
an
element
of
the
merits
case.
it
is
one
that
we
must
prove
at
all
three
stages
--
pleadings,
summary
judgment,
and
trial.
but
it
is
not
something
that
goes
to
the
rule
23
standard.
mr.
david
boies
no,
your
honor.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that.
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference.
i
think
there's
a
--
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
two
differences.
there's
a
difference
between
what
respondents
say
and
what
the
fifth
circuit
says.
the
fifth
circuit
talks
about
loss
causation,
says
it's
in
addition
to
efficient
market,
does
not
talk
about
reliance.
mr.
david
boies
there's
also
a
difference
between
what
respondents
say
and
what
this
court
has
said
in
basic
and
matrixx
and
the
other
cases,
in
terms
of
what
is
required
to
prove
for
class
certification.
what
is
required
to
prove
for
class
certification
under
rule
23,
unless
and
until
rule
23
is
changed,
is
that
common
issues
predominate.
common
issues
will
predominate
even
with
respect
to
what
the
respondents
here
argue
because
--
because
what
they
argue,
just
like
loss
causation,
is
a
common
issue.
mr.
david
boies
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
boies
i
don't
believe
under
this
court's
decision
in
basic
that,
given
the
actual
objective
facts
that
have
been
admitted
--
it's
a
very
public
market,
very
widespread
distribution
of
information,
a
lot
of
analysts
are
reporting
on
it
--
i
don't
believe
that
as
a
objective
factual
matter
they
would
be
able
ever
to
demonstrate
that
this
was
not
an
efficient
market.
if
you
had
a
much
smaller
market,
indeed
if
you
--
if
you
had
a
market
as
the
court
was
considering
in
basic,
which
was
a
much
smaller
market,
much
less
public,
much
less
analyst
support,
there
may
be
areas
in
which
they
--
they
could
rebut
it.
but
i
think,
given
what
we
all
know
about
the
halliburton
stocks
--
widely
traded,
large
number
of
shares
traded,
a
lot
of
analysts,
a
lot
of
public
information
--
i
don't
believe
under
this
court's
decision
in
basic
you
could
conclude
reasonably
that
that
was
not
an
efficient
market.
mr.
david
boies
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
proof
is
class-wide,
it
is
something
that
goes
only
to
summary
judgment
or
trial.
it
does
not
go
to
the
class
certification
stage.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
whether
somebody
is
relying
on
an
efficient
market,
that
is
distinct
from
whether
a
particular
statement
was
or
was
not
actionable.
in
other
words,
the
summary
judgment
issue,
the
trial
issue,
is
whether
the
particular
statement
was
actionable
and
that
includes
all
of
the
things
that
the
court
identifies.
but
those
issues
are
going
to
be,
if
there
is
an
efficient
market,
class-wide
issues.
in
other
words,
it's
not
going
to
be
the
case
that
in
a
particular
instance
a
statement
did
not
get
into
the
market
will
affect
only
one
member
of
the
class.
it's
going
to
affect
all
members
of
the
class.
because
it
is
something
that
is
common
all
of
the
class
members,
rule
23
says
that
is
something
for
trial,
not
for
class
certification.
mr.
david
boies
because
if
there's
no
efficient
market,
then
individualized
issues
are
going
to
predominate.
that
is,
the
test
under
rule
23
is
whether
individual
issues
or
common
issues
are
going
to
predominate.
if
you
destroy
the
efficient
market
theory
in
a
particular
case,
then
individual
issues
of
reliance
can
predominate.
however,
that
can't
happen
with
respect
to
loss
causation
or
price
distortion
or
any
of
these
other
issues
that
are
fundamental
to
the
merits
and
are
common
to
the
entire
class,
because
if
there's
no
loss
causation,
there's
no
cause
of
action.
as
this
court
held
in
dura,
there
must
be
loss
causation.
so
if
there's
no
loss
causation
there
aren't
any
individual
issues
to
adjudicate.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
would
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
boies
thank
you,
your
honor.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
respond
to
mr.
sterling's
statement
that
all
we
had
to
do
was
show
one
statistically
significant
price
movement.
as
the
court
is
aware
from
the
briefing,
on
december
7th
of
2001,
the
halliburton
put
out
a
release
that
indicated
that
their
prior
statements
that
their
asbestos
reserves
were
--
were
adequate
were
not
--
were
not
true.
the
stock
dropped
42
percent,
more
than
42
percent.
the
actual
drop
was
42.4.
expert
witnesses
calculated
that
the
company's
specific
drop
was
slightly
larger
than
that
because
the
market
was
generally
going
up
that
day.
but
it
was
a
dramatic
drop.
their
own
expert,
as
is
indicated
in
the
briefing,
agreed
that
there
wasn't
anything
else
happening
that
day
other
than
asbestos
news,
and
so--
mr.
david
boies
--because
under
the
--
the
fifth
circuit
rule,
i
understand
that
counsel
disavows
the
actual
language
of
the
fifth
circuit
rule,
but
it
was
that
language
that
the
district
court
relied
on
in
failing
to
certify
the
class.
and
with
--
with
--
with
respect
to
the
fifth
circuit
test,
what
the
fifth
circuit
says
is
that
because
the
announcement
on
december
7th
did
not
specifically
reference
the
prior
announcements,
it
cannot
be
considered
a
correction
of
those
prior
announcements.
indeed,
the
court,
the
fifth
circuit
goes
even
further,
and
this
is
at
page
338
of
the
f.
supp.
opinion.
it
says,
quote:
the
district
court
must
decide
whether
the
corrective
disclosure
more
probably
than
not
shows
that
the
original
estimates
or
predictions
were
designed
to
defraud.
so
what
the
fifth
circuit
is
doing
is
it's
bringing,
even
the
defrauding
aspect,
not
just
the
falsity
aspect,
but
the
defrauding
aspect
right
into
the
class
certification
stage.
and
i
think
justice
scalia's
question
was
exactly
on
point
with
respect
to
discovery,
because
either
they're
going
to
make
these
merits
decisions
without
discovery
or
you're
going
to
have
all
of
the
discovery
before
you
have
the
class
certification.
it's
got
to
be
one
or
the
other.
and
in
either
case
what
is
happening
is
you're
converting
what
rule
23
says
is
an
issue
as
to
whether
common
issues
predominate
into
an
issue
as
to
what
is
the
strength
of
the
merits
claim
that
the
plaintiff
has,
and
while
it
is
true,
reliance
is
part
of
the
merits
claim.
the
reason
reliance
is
different
is
because
reliance,
if
it
--
if
there
is
no
reliance,
if
there's
no
efficient
market,
then
reliance
can
make
individual
issues
predominate,
but
when
the
only
issue
is
not
a
step
issue
like
efficient
market,
but
is
a
direct
merits
issue,
there
isn't
any
way
that
you
can
make
individual
issues
predominate
regardless
of
how
you
decide
it;
and
loss
causation
and
price
distortion
are
both
those
kind
of
common
issues;
and
counsel
says
he
doesn't
defend
the
--
the
actual
loss
causation
statements
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
fifth
circuit,
and
what
i
would
ask
is
whether
the
court,
if
the
court
does
decide
to
send
it
back,
that
the
court
look
at
what
the
right
standard
is
for
the
court
below
to
be
applying
when
it
deals
with
class
certification.
and
i
would
urge
the
court
that
when
you
have
pleadings,
summary
judgment,
and
trial
tests
for
merits
questions,
then
you
don't
need
another
merits
test
on
--
at
the
class
certification
stage,
even
if
rule
23
permitted
it,
which
we
don't
think
it
does.
what
rule
23
is
designed
to
do
is
simply
say
are
individual
issues
or
common
issues
going
to
predominate?
and
all
of
the
class
have
the
same
loss
causation,
have
the
same
price
distortion
issues.
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions,
that
completes
my
argument.
