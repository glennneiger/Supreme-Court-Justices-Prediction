justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-1403,
erica
p.
john
fund
v.
halliburton
company.
mr.
boies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
just
stop
you
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
boies,
if
could
what
if
that
had
been
disputed?
is
that
something
that
can
be
disputed
at
the
certification
stage?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice

g.
roberts,
jr.
class
certification
is
not
a
merits
determination
except
with
respect
to
reliance?
except
with
respect
to
the
fraud
on
the
market
theory?
that
you
can;
that
is
a
merits
inquiry
and
you
can
decide
it
at
the
class
certification
stage?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
sterling.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
suppose
if
you
prevail
and
a
defendant
tries
to
establish
at
the
certification
stage
that
there's
no
loss
causation
and
loses,
then
that's
law
of
the
case
and
you've
missed
the
three
opportunities
that
mr.
boies
was
willing
to
give
you
at
the
pleading
stage,
summary
judgment,
and
the
merits.
that
issue
is
out
of
the
case
if
you
lose,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
there's
no
--
no
new
evidence?
one
of
the
objections
to
your
theory
is
you
don't
have
discovery
at
the
certification
stage.
what
if
you
have
no
new
evidence
to
put
on
at
later
stages?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
you
--
on
page
13
of
your
brief
you
say
one
of
the
objections
to
it
--
to
your
opponents
or
your
friends'
view
is
that
it
would
just
postpone
the
defendant's
ability
to
rebut
the
presumption,
result
in
countless
classes
being
certified
with
the
certain
knowledge
that
they
would
have
to
be
decertified
later.
well,
if
it's
so
certain,
then
there's
no
in
terrorem
effect.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
sterling.
mr.
boies,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
win,
so
you
win
at
the
certification
stage
or
at
the
pleading
stage,
whatever.
so
why
is
it
such
i
big
deal
to
you
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
