justice
elena
kagan
mr.
boies,
what's
the
difference
then?
why
could
that
be
disputed
at
the
certification
stage,
but
not
the
question
of
price
impact?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
about
materiality?
could
you
rebut
materiality
at
the
certification
stage?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
now
i'm
a
little
confused,
because
the
efficient
market
and
materiality
are
all
part
of
the
prima
facie
case
triggering
the
basic
presumption.
so,
why
couldn't
you
rebut
one
part
of
that
case
but
not
another
part
of
that
case?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
whether
there's
an
efficient
market
is
also
common
to
all
members
of
the
class,
so
why
would
you
make
an
exception
for
that?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
sterling,
if
i
think
--
if
i
disagree
with
you
and
i
think
that
oscar
said
that
loss
causation
needs
to
be
shown
at
the
certification
stage,
you
agree
that
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
law;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
sterling,
i
wasn't
sure
what
argument
you
were
making
in
your
brief.
one
possible
argument
you
could
be
making
is
that
the
plaintiffs
have
to
show
a
price
impact.
another
possible
argument
you
could
be
making
is
that
you
have
to
have
the
opportunity
to
rebut
the
plaintiff's
use
of
the
basic
presumption
by
yourself
showing
that
there
was
no
price
impact.
and
you
seemed
often
to
be
saying
the
first,
even
though
i
would
think
that
the
second
is
the
most
you
can
make
as
a
--
as
a
plausible
argument.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
sterling,
maybe
this
is
just
to
repeat
justice
ginsburg's
question,
but
what
else
is
there?
i
mean,
what
would
not
be
proper
to
introduce
in
the
way
that
you're
talking
about
at
the
certification
stage?
justice
elena
kagan
the
fifth
circuit
suggested
that
scienter
could
come
in
at
the
--
at
the
certification
stage.
you're
disclaiming
that?
justice
elena
kagan
on
your
rebuttal
proof
point,
you
said
just
now
that
all
you
had
to
do
was
come
forward
with
some
evidence,
but
that
the
burden
remains
on
the
plaintiff.
is
that
--
what
kind
of
evidence
do
you
think
you
have
to
come
forward
with
in
order
to
flip
the
burden
back
to
the
plaintiff?
justice
elena
kagan
so
you're
saying
you
can
put
an
expert
on
the
stand
and
the
expert
will
say
there
was
no
price
impact,
and
then
the
plaintiffs
have
to
make
the
case
that
there,
in
fact,
was
a
--
a
price
impact
at
the
certification
stage,
that
the
plaintiffs
have
to
prove
that
by
a
preponderance?
justice
elena
kagan
once
you
put
a
expert
on
the
--
on
the
stand.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
does
suggest
that
the
basic
presumption
isn't
worth
much
in
your
world.
that
you
put
an
expert
on
the
stand,
and
the
basic
presumption
falls
away,
and
the
plaintiffs
have
to
actually
prove
their
case
at
that
very
early
stage
that
there
was
no
price
impact.
