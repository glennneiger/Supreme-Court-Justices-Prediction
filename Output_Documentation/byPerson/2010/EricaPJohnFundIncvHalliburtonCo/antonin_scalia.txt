mr.
--
mr.
boies,
you
talked
about
loss
causation.
the
respondents
assert
that
that's
not
what
the
fifth
circuit
was
really
doing,
that
--
that
really
they're
just
trying
to
rebut
the
presumption
essentially
of
--
of
basic
by
--
by
showing
that
at
the
--
at
the
far
end,
there
was
--
there
was
nothing
that
could
justify
the
presumption.
would
you
be
satisfied
if
we
just
said
that
we
agree
with
you
that
the
requirement
to
prove
loss
causation
is
--
is
no
good,
and
sent
it
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
then
let
the
fifth
circuit
adopt
the
theory
that
respondents
assert
they
have
already
adopted?
i
mean,
it's
sort
of
a
pyrrhic
victory,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
haven't
just
disapproved
loss
causation.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
--
they
would
construe
it
the
way
respondents
say
they
have
already
construed
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
what
you've
said
is
that
there's
really
no
difference
between
loss
causation
and
what
respondents
assert
that
the
fifth
circuit
found.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
--
but
you
--
you
would
want
us
to
say
that
and
not
just
say
that
loss
causation--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
acknowledged
that
if
the
cause
was
the
fact
that
the
market
was
not
efficient,
that
could
be
raised
at
the
certification
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
--
can
you
do
this
in
reverse?
i
mean,
suppose
the
class
comes
in
and,
instead
of
proving
at
the
outset
that
the
market's
an
efficient
market
and
allege
a
misrepresentation,
they
come
in
at
the
back
end
and
they
say:
when
that
statement
that
we
assert
was
a
misrepresentation
was
corrected,
the
price
of
stock
went
down
and
we
lost
money.
now,
it
seems
to
me
you
would
have
to
argue,
well,
that's
a
good
allegation
if
it's
an
efficient
market,
which
is
a
common
question,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
can
certify
under
rule
23
by
using
the
back
end.
instead
of
proving
the
efficient
market,
they
can
prove
that
there
was
a
statement
correcting
the
alleged
misrepresentation,
the
price
of
stock
went
down,
right,
and
they
can
certify
the
class?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
a
common
question
whether
the
market's
efficient
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
relying
on
that
assumption.
they
--
they
come
in
and
show
that
there
was
a
correction
of
what
we
alleged
was
a
misstatement
and
the
market
went
down.
that's
all
that
they
allege.
and
of
course,
that
proves
anything
only
if
there's
an
efficient
market.
but
that
will
be
a
common
question
to
the
whole
class,
so
we'll,
we'll
--
we'll
save
that
for
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they
assert
that.
they
assert
that
the
reason
it
went
down
was
because
of
the
initial
misstatement.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
i'm
just
saying
that
seems
to
me
it's
a
crazy
way
to
run
a
railroad.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
can
allege
what's
upfront,
you
can
allege
what's
--
what's
in
the
back,
and
what's
upfront
becomes
a
common
question,
so
you
certify
the
whole
class.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
why
do
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
means
you
would
lose.
i
--
i
mean,
which
means
that
the
plaintiff
would
lose.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
not
a
common
issue,
that
the
--
that
the
latter
question,
whether
in
fact
the
market
was
affected
or
not
is,
is
not
a
common
question.
rule
23
only
requires
that
--
that
there
be
a
common
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
the
whole
reason
you
--
you
say
that
the
class
certification
stage
is
so
significant
is
precisely
because
once
the
class
is
certified,
there
will
be
immense
discovery
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
which
will
be
so
expensive
for
defendants
that
they're
inclined
to
throw
in
the
towel.
now
you're
telling
us
that
you
--
you
want
to
move
discovery
up
to
the
class
certification
stage?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
--
i'm
sure
it
wasn't
your
point,
but--
[laughter]
