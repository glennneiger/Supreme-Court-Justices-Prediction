fund
or
we'll
call
it
epj
fund
purchased
stock
in
halliburton
company,
one
of
the
respondents
here.
after
the
stock
price
took
a
dive,
epj
fund
filed
a
lawsuit,
alleging
that
halliburton
had
committed
securities
fraud.
the
just
of
the
complaint
was
that
halliburton
had
made
various
false
statements
that
inflated
its
stock
price
and
after
the
truth
came
to
light,
the
price
of
halliburton
stock
dropped
causing
epj
fund
to
lose
money.
now,
epj
fund
is
not
the
only
investor
who
claims
to
have
lost
money
because
of
halliburton's
conduct.
epj
fund
sought
to
proceed
as
the
representative
of
the
whole
class
of
people
who
invested
and
lost
money.
these
sorts
of
class
actions
allow
groups
of
plaintiffs
to
join
together
and
file
one
consolidated
case.
now,
there
are
several
requirements
that
must
be
met
in
order
for
such
a
class
action
to
proceed.
“as
relevant
here,
epj
fund
had
to
show
that,”
and
this
is
a
quote
from
the
law,
“questions
of
law
or
fact
common
to
class
members
would
predominate
over
any
questions
affecting
only
individual
members.
this
ensures
that
it
makes
sense
to
have
the
plaintiffs
proceed
as
a
group
rather
than
individually.
now,
to
determine
whether
common
questions
will
predominate
over
individual
ones,
you
need
to
consider
what
the
elements
of
the
underlying
cause
of
action
are.
in
order
to
prove
securities
fraud,
plaintiffs
need
to
establish
several
things.
one
of
those
things
is
reliance.
reliance
is
proof
that
you
relied
on
the
false
statements
when
deciding
to
buy
the
stock.
now,
in
the
prior
case
of
ours
called
basic
incorporated
versus
levinson,
we
held
that
we
would
presume
an
investor
relies
an
all
public
statements
about
a
company
whenever
he
buys
or
sells
that
company's
stock
at
a
price
set
by
the
market.
this
is
based
on
the
theory
that
the
market
price
reflects
all
public
information
about
the
stock
and
therefore,
when
you
buy
at
the
stock
price,
it's
like
relying
on
all
the
statements
that
go
into
the
price.
now,
this
theory
helps
plaintiffs
show
that
common
issues
were
likely
predominate
over
individual
ones.
the
courts
below
applied
a
rule
that
in
order
to
invoke
this
presumption
of
reliance,
the
plaintiffs
had
to
show
what
we
called
“loss
causation.”
loss
causation
is
a
separate
element
of
securities
fraud.
to
prove
loss
causation,
securities
fraud
plaintiffs
need
to
show
that
their
claimed
economic
loss
was
caused
by
the
defendant's
deceptive
conduct.
if
the
truth
of
the
misrepresentation
comes
out
and
the
stock
price
drops
10%,
you
might
not
be
able
to
show
the
loss
was
caused
by
the
fraud,
if
for
example
every
other
company
in
that
line
of
work
also
lost
10%
because
of
a
bad
economic
forecast
or
something
like
that.
now
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
that
epj
fund
could
not
prove
loss
causation
and
therefore,
could
not
have
its
class
certified.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
because
other
courts
of
appeals
had
held
that
securities
fraud
plaintiffs
do
not
need
to
prove
loss
causation
at
the
class
certification
stage,
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
that
conflict
and
we
now
reversed,
whether
or
not
a
lost
that
an
investor
suffered
was
caused
by
fraud
or
something
else
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
investor
relied
on
the
false
statement
in
the
first
place.
loss
causation
is
concerned
with
the
backend
of
the
securities
fraud
claim
whether
the
defendant's
false
statements
were
responsible
for
the
later
drop
in
the
stocks
price.
reliance
is
concerned
with
the
front-end,
whether
the
false
statement
somehow
influenced
an
investor's
decision
to
buy
the
stock
in
the
first
place,
and
there's
no
logical
connection
between
the
two.
in
fact,
halliburton
concedes
that
epj
fund
should
not
have
been
required
to
prove
loss
causation
to
trigger
the
presumption
of
reliance.
halliburton
instead
claims
that
when
the
lower
courts
used
the
term
loss
causation,
they
really
meant
something
else,
something
called
“price
impact.”
i'm
not
going
to
explain
what
price
impact
is
beyond
noting
that
like
loss
causation,
it’s
a
familiar
term
in
securities
law
and
the
terms
mean
two
very
different
things.
we
take
the
court
of
appeal
as
its
word.
it
used
the
term
loss
causation
more
than
20
times
in
its
opinion.
it
never
used
the
term
price
impact
so
the
decision
below
cannot
stand.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
