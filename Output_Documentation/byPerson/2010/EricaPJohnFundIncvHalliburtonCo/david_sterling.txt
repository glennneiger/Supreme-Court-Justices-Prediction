mr.
david
sterling
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
basic
recognized
that,
absent
the
class-wide
presumption
of
fraud
on
the
market
reliance,
individual
issues
of
reliance
predominate,
as
they
do
in
any
other
fraud
context.
consequently,
when
a
district
court,
after
the
rigorous
analysis
required
by
rule
23,
finds
that
the
presumption
is
unavailable
or
rebutted,
reliance
ceases
to
be
a
class-wide
issue.
mr.
david
sterling
we
argued
it
below
based
upon
the
premise
in
basic
that
the
presumption
is
rebutted
when
there
is
proof--
mr.
david
sterling
--that
the
market
price
did
not
distort--
mr.
david
sterling
--it
was
not
addressed
as
a
merits
question,
justice
sotomayor.
it
was
addressed,
as
oscar
said,
as
a
prerequisite
for
finding
reliance
in
order
to
certify
the
class.
mr.
david
sterling
we
are
not
defending
all
of
the
language
in
oscar,
clearly,
but
the
basic
test
in
the
fifth
circuit,
as
our
case
made
clear
on
pages
116a
and
119a
of
the
petition
appendix,
is
not
loss
causation;
it's
price
impact,
because
basic
says
at
page
248
any
showing
that
severs
the
link
between
the
misrepresentation
and
the
stock
price
defeats
the
presumption.
basic
makes
clear
on
that
same
page
that
a
showing
that
the
stock
price
was
not
distorted
by
the
misrepresentation
defeats
the
presumption.
mr.
david
sterling
we
do
agree
with
that,
justice
kagan.
but
our
opinion
made
clear
that
it's
not
loss
causation
as
this
court
knows
it
in
dura;
the
test
is
simply
price
impact.
and
the
fifth
circuit
recognized
--
and
the
fund
recognized
this
below
on
page
551a
of
the
joint
appendix
--
their
only
burden
under
the
fifth
circuit
caselaw
was
to
show
price
impact,
and
they
could
show
it
either
of
two
ways.
their
papers
show
this,
page
116
and
119a
of
the
joint
appendix.
they
can
show
price
inflation
upon
a
misrepresentation,
which,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
dura,
is
not
synonymous
with
loss
causation.
or
failing
that
--
and
they
could
not
show
that
here
because
their
own
proof
showed
that
none
of
the
alleged
misrepresentations
moved
the
market.
so,
the
alternative
way
to
show
price
impact
is
simply
to
show
a
price
decline
following
a
corrective
disclosure.
and
while
that
showing
is
similar
to
loss
causation,
it's
an
easier,
less
rigorous
showing
of
loss
causation,
because
under
the
price
impact
test
at
the
fifth
circuit,
all
the
plaintiff
need
show
is
that
it's
reasonable
to
infer
that
some
portion
of
the
decline
was
attributable
to
the
revelation
of
the
truth.
mr.
david
sterling
if
we
suggested
the
first,
justice
kagan,
i
apologize
because
we
did
not
intend
to.
basic
puts
the
initial
burden
on
the
defendant
to
show
the
absence
of
price
impact,
showing
that
the
presumed
fact
does
not
exist.
once
that
threshold
showing
is
made,
the
burden
remains
on
the
plaintiff
under
rule
301
and
rule
23
to
show
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
market
price
was
in
fact,
distorted.
mr.
david
sterling
we
agree,
your
honor,
that
the
fifth
circuit
put
the
initial
burden
of
production
on
the
plaintiff
and
that's
contrary
to
basic.
we
--
we
agree
with
that.
however,
in
terms
of
the
fifth
circuit's
language
that
i
believe
your
honor's
referring
to,
that
is
when
the
fifth
circuit
was
discussing
the
alleged
corrective
disclosures.
because
the
plaintiff
could
not
show
that
any
of
the
alleged
misrepresentations
moved
the
market,
they
had
to
rely
upon
what
they
claimed
were
corrective
disclosures.
that
was
the
only
way
they
could
show
price
impact.
the
fifth
circuit,
at
various
times,
looked
at
each
of
the
alleged
corrective
disclosures
and
said
that's
not
a
corrective
disclosure
because
it
doesn't
reveal
the
truth
in
any
way;
it's
bad
news,
but
it's
non-culpable
bad
news.
it
doesn't
in
any
way
suggest
that
halliburton
said
something
during
the
class
period
that
was
false.
mr.
david
sterling
justice
breyer,
the
--
the
problem
is,
we're
back
to
reliance.
basic
exists
--
basic
creates
a
presumption
as
an
exception
to
the
long
understood
rule
that
fraud
cases
were
not
appropriate
vehicles
for
class
actions
because
each
individual
would
have
to
say,
mr.
smith
in
your
hypothetical,
i
read
halliburton's
statement
and
i
relied
upon
it.
basic
said,
because
that's
so
impractical
cases
would
never
be
certified,
we're
going
to
say
we're
going
to
assume
the
entire
market
is
like
mr.
smith,
and
mr.
smith
relies
on
the
integrity
of
the
stock
price
when
the
stock
price
is
distorted
by
the
misrepresentation.
but
if
the
stock
price
was
not
in
fact
distorted
by
the
misrepresentation,
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
everybody
relied
on
the
misrepresentation
through
its
effect
on
the
stock
price.
mr.
david
sterling
but
justice
scalia,
basic
sets
forth
a
special
rule.
basic
is
an
exception
to
the
long-understood
rule
about
the
nonsusceptibility
in
class
actions
to
class
treatment
of
fraud
cases.
basic
says
it's
not
just
enough
to
allege
the
operative
facts,
and
we
will
presume
reliance.
basic
says
you
have
to
plead
and
prove
them,
and
all
of
those
operative
facts
are
subject
to
common
proof.
the
efficient
market:
the
efficient
market
applies
to
everybody,
it's
common
proof.
everybody
recognizes,
everybody
agrees,
mr.
boies
said
so
today,
and
the
government
said
so
today:
if
the
market
--
if
the
district
court
does
not
find
that
the
market
--
that
the
market
for
the
stock
is
efficient
at
the
class
certification
stage,
you
can't
certify,
because
it's
not
reasonable
to
infer
then
that
the
misrepresentation
was
translated
into
the
stock
price.
materiality
is
another
requirement
under
basic.
it's
a
threshold
condition.
again,
common
proof.
all
the
courts
except
for
the
seventh
circuit
agree
materiality
must
be
proven
at
the
class
certification
level.
same
thing
for
whether
the
misrepresentation
was
public.
if
it
was
not
publicly
made,
it's
not
reasonable
to
infer
that
it
had
an
impact
on
the
stock
price.
all
of
these
operative
facts
are
subject
to
common
proof.
but
basic
says
unless
those
facts
are
proven
at
the
class
certification
stage,
the
presumption
of
class-wide
reliance
doesn't
apply
and
individual
issues
of
reliance
predominate.
the
same
must
be
true
for
rebuttal
proof.
basic
says
eight
times
that
the
presumption
is
rebuttable,
and
it
makes
no
sense
at
all
to
rely
upon
these
indirect
or
surrogate,
circumstantial
proof
of
whether
the
misrepresentation
moved
the
market.
that's
all
these
are
--
materiality,
whether
it
was
publicly
made,
whether
the
market
was
efficient.
these
are
all
just
surrogates
of
whether
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
or
to
infer
that
the
stock
price
was
in
fact
distorted
by
the
misrepresentation.
mr.
david
sterling
because
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
sterling
well,
again,
general
market
efficiency
is
just
a
proxy
or
a
surrogate
for
whether
it's
reasonable
to
think
the
conditions
exist
for
the
stock
price
to
be
affected
by
a
misrepresentation.
mr.
david
sterling
one
reason
is
because
the
market
deemed
the
information
to
be
immaterial,
the
market
didn't
care
about
it,
the
market
didn't
react
to
it.
another
reason
could
be
that,
while
a
market
is
generally
efficient,
a
market
was
inefficient
for
this
type
of
information.
i--
mr.
david
sterling
--we
conceded
efficiency
below
because,
candidly,
their
own
proof
showed
that
none
of
the
misrepresentations
moved
the
market.
and
what
we
have
here
is
not
circumstantial
proof
of
general
market
efficiency
or
materiality
or
whether
the
statement
was
public;
here
there
was
direct
proof
that
none
of
these
misrepresentations
moved
the
market,
and
that
is
the
whole
premise
of
the
basic
class-wide
presumption
of
reliance.
basic
itself
says
if
the
stock
price
was
not
distorted
by
the
misrepresentation,
you
can't
say
the
entire
class
relied
upon
the
misrepresentation
to
the
stock
price.
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
it
is
the
dna
proof,
and
it
makes
no
sense
for
district
courts
to
be
certifying
class
actions
based
upon
this
indirect
or
circumstantial
proof
while
ignoring
the
direct
proof
of
the
absence
of
price
impact.
and
in
effect
what
they're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
extend
basic.
basic
itself
is
a
judicially
created
presumption
designed
to
make
a
judicially
created
cause
of
action
easier
to
be
maintained
as
a
class
action.
now,
it
was
one
thing
for
courts
decades
ago
to
imply
a
private
cause
of
action
under
10(b)
and
it
was
another
thing
for
this
court
to
create
a
rebuttable
presumption
of
reliance
in
basic
in
order
to
make
it
easier
to
maintain
these
cases
as
class
actions.
but
it
would
do
violence
to
stoneridge's
admonition
that
the
10b
cause
of
action
ought
not
be
further
expanded
to
now
make
that
rebuttable
presumption
of
reliance
irrebuttable
at
the
class
certification
stage.
mr.
david
sterling
justice
ginsburg,
that
--
that
is
not
our
position.
our
position
is
in
order
to
get
the
class-wide
presumption
of
reliance,
it's
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
plead
and
prove
upfront
as
threshold
facts,
a
public
misrepresentation
that
was
material
made
in
an
efficient
market.
however,
the
defendant
has
the
right
at
the
class
certification
stage
to
rebut
that
presumption
by
any
showing,
to
quote
basic,
"that
severs
the
length
between
the
misrepresentation
and
the
stock
price.
"
when
that
threshold
showing
is
made,
the
burden
is
back
on
the
plaintiff
to
demonstrate
the
necessary
linkage.
it's
not
a
finding
on
the
merits.
a
determination
at
the
class
certification
stage
is
simply
one
of
whether
the
rule
23(b)
predominance
requirement
is
met
and
whether
the
class
can
appropriately
proceed
as
a
class,
as
opposed
to
in
the
traditional
individual
fashion,
and
that
finding
is
not
binding
on
the
ultimate
finder
of
fact.
mr.
david
sterling
falsity,
scienter,
actual
proof
of
loss
causation,
and
damages.
mr.
david
sterling
footnote
35
of
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
makes
clear
that
it
is
not
requiring
scienter.
the
fifth
circuit
says,
in
response
--
in
analyzing
what
is
or
is
not
a
corrective
disclosure,
it
says
it
has
to
do
something
that
suggests
that
a
statement
was
made
that
is
potentially
actionable
was
false.
otherwise
it's
not
a
revelation
of
the
truth.
and
all
that
is,
again,
is
a
second
way
under
the
fifth
circuit's
test
of
showing
whether
there
is
the
necessary
price
impact
to
justify
certifying
a
class,
or
alternatively
to
determine
that
individual
issues
of
reliance
predominate.
and
allowing
the
defendants
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
reliance
at
the
class
certification
stage
is
consistent
with
this
court's
class
action
case
law
and
with
rule
23.
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
the
rule
23
requirements
are
not
to
be
presumed,
they're
not
to
be
assumed,
they
have
to
be
found.
actual
conformance
is
the
test.
mr.
david
sterling
correct
your
honor.
but
23(b)(3)
requires
a
court
to
make
a
finding
that
predominance
exists.
and
the
2003
amendments
to
the
--
to
rule
23
make
clear
that
a
court
should
not
certify
a
class
unless
and
until
it
is
satisfied
that
all
of
the
rule
23
requirements
are
met;
and
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
a
court
is
going
to
conduct
this
rigorous
analysis
and
make
the
rule
23(b)(3)
findings
without
considering
the
defendant's
rebuttal
proof
of
whether,
in
fact,
there
was
price
impact,
because
basic
itself
says
if
there
is
no
price
impact,
the
presumption
falls
away,
individual
issues
of
reliance
predominate,
and
the
class
cannot
be
certified.
mr.
david
sterling
well,
under
basic,
it's
any
showing
that
severs
the
link,
and
here
it
was
proof
--
we
had
our
own
expert
that
demonstrated
that,
again
kind
of
harping
on
their
expert
--
none
of
the
misrepresentations
inflated
the
stock
price--
mr.
david
sterling
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
sterling
under
rule
301,
the
presumption
does
not
shift
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof.
it
stays
on
the
party
that
--
that
bears
it.
that
is
consistent
with
rule
23
as
well,
which
puts
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff,
to
prove
all
of
the
rule
23
elements
exist.
mr.
david
sterling
we
agree,
your
honor,
that
they
have
to
show
price
impact,
but
that's
not
a
hard
burden
to
show.
if
any
of
their
22
--
they
allege
that
we
made
misrepresentations
that
were
false
on
22
days
during
the
class
period.
all
they
had
to
do
was
show
one
day
during
that
class
period
statistically
significant
price
movement,
and
they're
in.
or
all
they
had
to
show
was
any
of
the
alleged
--
i've
forgotten
how
many
--
corrective
disclosures
during
the
class
period.
any
one
day,
if
there
was
a
--
a
meaningful
price
movement
that
a
court
could
infer
was
related
to
the
revelation
of
truth,
that's
all
they
need
to
show.
but
they
couldn't
show
that.
mr.
david
sterling
no,
your
honor,
because
the
finding
at
the
class
certification
stage
is
not
binding
upon
the
ultimate
fact
finder.
so
if
the
--
if
the
court
determines
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
reliance
is
not
there,
if
the
court
--
if
the
case
goes
to
trial
and
an
individual
plaintiff
brings
his
or
her
own
case
based
upon
subjective
reliance,
that
the
court's
determination
that
the
class
certification
stage
is
not
binding
on
the
jury.
mr.
david
sterling
it's
possible
that
the
jury
would
agree
with
the
judge
who
made
the
determination
at
the
class
certification
hearing,
it's
possible
that
the
judge
--
that
the
jury
might
not.
but
the
discovery
issue,
your
honor,
is
a
complete
red
herring,
because
rule
23
makes
clear
that
the
district
court
has
ample
discretion
at
the
class
certification
stage
to
allow
discovery
into
the
merits
to
the
extent
that
they
are
relevant
to
the
class
certification
issue.
and
more
importantly
here,
the
fund
never
asked
for
discovery.
in
fact,
when
the
fund
filed
its
motion
for
class
certification
on
page
139a
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
fund
said
no
discovery
is
needed
to
resolve
this
motion
except
for
expert
discovery.
the
fund
never
asked
for
discovery
at
the
district
court
level,
the
fund
never
asked
for
discovery
at
the
fifth
circuit.
the
only
time
they've
ever
hinted
that
they
wanted
discovery
related
to
the
class
certification
issue
was
at
this
court.
mr.
david
sterling
justice
scalia,
that
was
not
my
point,
and
i
apologize
if
--
if
it
came
out
that
way.
mr.
david
sterling
all
--
all
--
all
i
was
--
all
i
suggesting
that
if
a
plaintiff
were
to
say,
you
know,
your
honor,
to
the
district
court,
we
think
we
--
we
can't
--
we
should
not
have
the
class
certification
hearing
yet
because
we
need
some
discovery
on
point
a,
b,
c,
which
did
not
happen
here,
the
district
court
can
say
fine
or
can
say
i
don't
think
you
need
it.
but
the
premise
of
your
question
is
certainly
correct.
the
grant
of
class
certification
is
a
seminal
event
in
a
10b-5
case.
it
has
huge
repercussions
for
the
defendant.
mr.
david
sterling
just
when
--
that's
assuming
that
the
defendant
has
the
wherewithal
to
stick
it
out
through
it
all,
but
the
sheer
grant
of
class
certification
which
aggregates
hundreds,
tens,
thousands
--
tens
of
thousands
of
these
claims
together
in
one
big
case
makes
every
one
of
these
cases,
in
effect,
a
company
case,
and
it
puts
huge
settlement
pressure
on
the
defendant.
i
mean,
in
--
in
this
case
halliburton
had
440
million
shares
of
stock
outstanding
during
the
class
period.
the
class
period
lasts
2
1/2
years.
it's
easy
to
do
the
math
and
say
that
had
this
class
been
certified,
there
would
have
been
huge
pressure
upon
halliburton
to
settle.
mr.
david
sterling
basic
is
really
an
exception
that
applies
only--
mr.
david
sterling
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
sterling
but
you
couldn't
have--
mr.
david
sterling
--no,
your
honor.
you
couldn't
have
a
case
in
that
situation
because
reliance
is
an
individual
issue.
mr.
david
sterling
yes,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
david
sterling
--you
still
have
everybody
having
to
say
mr.
jackson
is
my
agent.
that's--
mr.
david
sterling
--right.
and
that's
a
--
but
the
individualized
question
of
reliance
is
simply,
is
mr.
jackson
your
agent
or
not?
because
of
that
there
is
no
common
issue
that
--
that
predominates
on
reliance.
mr.
david
sterling
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
below
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
