justice

counsel,
doesn't
a
lack
of
response
to
a
disclosure
--
couldn't
it
be
in
some
situations
reflective
of
an
inefficient
market?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
is
it?
why
is
this
case
--
why
can't
you
pigeonhole
this
case
into
that
argument,
which,
it
appears
what
your
--
what
the
respondents
have
done
is
move
away
from
the
loss
causation
proof
and
gone
to
the
issue
of
whether
they
rebutted
reliance
or
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
see
or
what
difference
do
you
see
between
their
loss
causation
evidence
and
an
inefficient
market?
could
they
--
assuming
there
was
no
stipulation
in
this
case,
do
you
see
any
difference
in
--
in
how
they
could
use
the
fact
that
other
information
affected
the
market
and
not
this
one?
or
is
it
your
theory
of
the
case
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
could
marshal
to
show
that
this
is
an
inefficient
market?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
--
when
--
what
in
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
puts
this
inquiry
into
the
reliance
prong
and
where
did
you
argue
it
this
way
below?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
you
give
me
a
place
in
the
record
where
you
actually
said
that,
as
opposed
to
relying
on
oscar
to
argue
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
right
in
addressing
as
a
merits
question
whether
the
plaintiff
had
proven
loss
causation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
not
defending
the
rationale
of
the
fifth
circuit
now?
you're
--
you're
sort
of
backing
yourself
into
the
reliance
element?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
could
you
explain
to
me
why
in
this
case
it's
not
reasonable
to
believe,
meaning
assuming
the
truth,
that
there
was
falsity
in
the
statements
made,
those
alleged--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--assuming
truth
to
those
statements,
why
wouldn't
a
market
react
to
corrective
measures?
because
what
i
see
is
a
difference
between
saying
it's
an
inefficient
market
or
that
the
statements
had
no
price
impact
for
some
other
merits-related
reason.
but
why
does
that
tie
to
an
inefficient
market
at
all?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
tell
me
why
on
its
face,
with
the
false
statements
alleged
here,
why
would
it
be
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
the
market
wouldn't
respond
to
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
you
conceded
efficiency
below,
so
you've
sort
of
given
up
that
argument.
