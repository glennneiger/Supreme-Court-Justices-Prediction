justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
--
i'm
trying
this
question
out.
try
to
give
me
your
best
answer.
if
i
don't
have
it
clear
enough,
just
forgive
it
and
go
on
to
another.
as
i'm
understanding
this
case
with
basic,
the
idea
is
there
is
a
presumption.
somebody
lies
and
says
there's
an
oil
well
i
found
oil
in.
a
lot
of
people
buy
on
the
stock
market.
it
turns
out
there
was
no
oil,
and
a
lot
of
people
say
they
lost
money.
all
right.
the
point
of
the
stock
market
presumption
is
to
say:
smith,
you're
a
typical
plaintiff
and
this
presumption
is
going
to
help
you
by
the
following.
we're
going
to
say
what
happened
to
the
typical
person
on
the
stock
market
during
that
period
happened
to
you,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
bought
and
sold
on
the
stork
market.
and
that's
why
efficient
markets
is
needed
to
show
at
the
certification
stage,
because
if
there
weren't
certification
--
if
that
isn't
shown,
the
whole
thing
falls
apart.
but
what
you're
just
saying
on
terms
of
whether
the
revelation
lowered
the
price
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
of
what
happened
to
the
typical
person,
smith,
happened
to
you,
nothing
to
do
with
it.
it
has
to
do
with
whether
anybody
was
hurt.
now,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
certification
stage.
that's
the
win
or
lose
stage.
now,
that's
how
i'm
understanding
it
at
the
moment.
so
what's
wrong
with
the
way
i
understand
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
your
rule
apply
in
all
fraud
cases?
that
is,
a
thousand
farmers
say,
mr.
jackson
was
our
common
buying
agent,
and
the
defendant
lied
to
mr.
jackson,
and
he
relied
on
the
lie.
it
is
a
common
issue
whether
he
relied
on
the
lie
or
he
didn't
rely
on
the
lie.
i
can
understand
somebody
saying
at
the
certification
stage
they
have
to
see
whether
he's
really
a
common
agent.
but
let's
imagine
that's
assumed.
the
only
question
left
is,
did
he
rely
or
not
rely?
is
that
a
question
for
the
merits
or
is
that
a
question
for
the
common
--
for
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
you're
saying
in
the
case
that
i
just
gave
you
reliance
is
for
the
merits?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whether
he
really
relied
or
didn't
rely,
the
common
agent
is
for
the
merits?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
--
is
that
your
answer
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
a
thousand
people
say
mr.
jackson
is
our
common
buying
agent,
and
the
defendant
lied
to
this
common
buying
agent,
and
he
represented
us.
relied
on
that.
i'm
asking
if
you
that
issue
of
reliance
in
an
appropriate
case
is
for
the
certification
stage?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
also
have
to
prove
there
is
a
lie?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
