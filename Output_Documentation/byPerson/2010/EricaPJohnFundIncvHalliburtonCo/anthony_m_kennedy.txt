justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
rule
isn't,
i
take
it
--
or
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
that
simply
because
the
issue
is
on
a
class-wide
basis,
it
can't
be
challenged
at
the
certification
stage.
we
don't
have
a
rule
that's
that
broad,
do
we?
or
am
i
missing
a
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
there's
no
demonstrated
basis
that
that
common
issue
exists?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
except,
just
to
add
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
an
efficient
market
theory?
