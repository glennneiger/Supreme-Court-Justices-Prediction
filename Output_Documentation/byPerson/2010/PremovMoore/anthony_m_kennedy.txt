it's
a
little
hard
when
we
take
away
the
finding
that
the
confession
was
admissible.
we
have
to
extract
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
to
do
with
the
state
court's
case,
assuming
we
have
to
presume,
because
of
the
posture
of
the
case,
that
the
confession
was
inadmissible.
justice
anthony

the
second
case
to
be
announced
is
premo
versus
moore,
number
09-658.
moore
was
found
guilty
of
murder
in
an
oregon
state
court.
and
this
case
calls
for
determinations
that
are
parallel
in
some
respects
to
those
just
discussed
in
harrington
versus
richter.
particularly,
it
involves
an
allegation
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
richter,
the
case
just
discussed
involved
an
allegation
that
the
defense
counsel
in
the
conduct
and
preparation
of
the
trial
was
--
was
deficient.
this
case
concerns
moore's
claim
that
his
counsel
was
deficient
during
pretrial
negotiations
that
led
to
a
plea
agreement.
there
was
never
a
trial.
there
was
a
plea
agreement
of
plea
of
guilty.
randy
moore
kidnapped
a
man
in
oregon
and
killed
him
with
a
single
shot
to
the
head.
he
admitted
the
killing
of
two
people
and
then
confessed
to
the
police.
he
said
the
gun's
discharge
was
accidental.
he
pled
no
contest
to
felony
murder.
and
after
that,
no
contest
plea,
he
was
found
guilty
by
the
trial
judge.
he
received
the
25-year
sentence,
which
was
the
minimum
allowed
under
oregon
law.
later,
he
sought
postconviction
relief
from
an
oregon
court.
he
argued
that
his
attorney
was
ineffective.
he
said
that
his
counsel
should
have
moved
to
suppress
the
confessions
before
moore
made
the
plea
agreement.
the
oregon
court
rejected
the
claim.
it
concluded
that
suppression
would
have
been
fruitless
because
moore
had
also
confessed
to
two
other
people.
the
district
court
denied
moore's
subsequent
petition
for
federal
habeas
corpus
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
to
accord
scant
deference
to
counsel's
judgment.
and
it
was
doubly
wrong
to
conclude
that
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
for
the
state
court
to
find
that
the
defense
attorney
provided
effective
assistance.
acknowledging
guilt
and
accepting
responsibility
by
an
early
plea
respond
to
certain
basic
premises
in
the
law
and
its
function.
those
principles
are
eroded
if
a
guilty
plea
is
too
easily
set
aside
based
on
facts
and
circumstances
not
apparent
to
counsel
at
the
time
of
plea
is
being
considered.
plea
bargains
are
the
result
of
complex
negotiations,
and
defense
attorneys
must
make
careful
strategic
choices
in
balancing
the
opportunities
and
the
risks.
the
opportunity
--
opportunities,
of
course,
include
pleading
to
a
lesser
charge
and
obtaining
a
lesser
sentence,
as
compared
with
what
might
be
the
outcome,
not
only
at
trial
but
from
a
later
plea
offer
if
the
case
grows
stronger
and
the
prosecutors
find
stiffened
resolve.
a
risk,
in
addition
to
the
obvious
one
of
losing
the
chance
for
a
defense
verdict,
is
that
an
early
plea
might
come
before
the
prosecution
finds
its
case
is
getting
weaker,
not
stronger.
the
state's
case
can
begin
to
fall
apart
as
stories
change
and
witnesses
become
unavailable,
and
new
suspects
are
identified.
moore's
counsel
could
reasonably
believe
that
a
swift
plea
bargain
would
allow
his
client
to
take
advantages
of
the
state's
aversion
to
these
hazards.
a
plea
would
also
eliminate
the
possibility
that
one
of
moore's
accomplices
would
testify
against
him
in
exchange
for
a
better
deal
for
themselves.
and
delaying
the
plea
for
further
proceedings
would
have
given
the
state
time
to
uncover
additional
incriminating
evidence
that
could
have
formed
the
basis
of
a
capital
prosecution.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
court's
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
