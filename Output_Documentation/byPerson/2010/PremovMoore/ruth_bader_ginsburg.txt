but
isn't
--
isn't
fulminante
relevant
as
--
just
for
the
proposition
that
a
defendant's
own
confession
carries
heavy
weight,
leaving
the
rest
of
it
--
the
statement
that
--
in
fulminante
that
when
a
defendant
confesses
to
the
crime,
that
carries
heavy
weight?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
judge
berzon's
test,
that
seems
to
be
simple
and
a
matter
of
common
sense,
that
if
you
get
rid
of
the
confession,
then
you
have
a
better
chance
of
getting
a
good
deal
in
the
plea
bargain?
the
confession
certainly
--
it
--
this
serves
the
defendant
to
get
rid
of
that
as
well
as
weight
on
the
prosecution's
side.
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
kroger,
from
--
general
kroger
--
from
everything
you
said,
and
i
take
it
--
from
your
brief,
too,
that
you
are
not
urging
the
--
that
--
that
counsel's
assistance
was
adequate?
you
are
not
contesting
that
the
confession
was
involuntary?
you
seem
to
be
putting
everything
on
the
prejudice
issue;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
his
argument
that
his
failure
--
the
defendant
in
the
case
arising
out
of
this
episode,
if
salyer
did
go
to
trial
and
he
ended
up
getting
that
exact
same
sentence
that
this
defendant
did?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
wax,
just
to
clear
out
some
of
the
underbrush,
the
ninth
circuit
did
say
that
fulminante
was
really
established
law
controlling
this
case.
i
take
it
that
you
are
not
defending
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
he
say
that?
is
there
a
statement
in
the
record
that
moore
said
he
would
have
insisted
on
going
to
trial
had
he
been
advised
that
the
suppression
motion
had
merit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you
--
i
think
general
kroger
brought
up
that
moore
carried
the
gun.
it
was
cocked,
and
he
shot
--
who
was
it?
roger.
