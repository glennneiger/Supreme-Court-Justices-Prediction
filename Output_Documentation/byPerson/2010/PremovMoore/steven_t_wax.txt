mr.
steven
t.
wax
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
moore
established
prejudice
under
hill
from
his
attorney's
failure
to
recognize
the
involuntariness
and
inadmissibility
of
the
lengthy
tape
recorded
statement
obtained
from
him
by
the
police.
the
most
critical
type
of
evidence
that
the
state
can
have
in
any
case.
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion
to
that
effect
was
correct,
and
was
correctly
based
on
this
court's
precedence
of
strickland,
hill,
and
kimmelman.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
case
is
not
as
the
state
would
have
it,
a
strong
case
in
the
absence
of
this
confession.
we
also
believe
that
the
proper
focus
is
not
solely
on
the
strength
of
the
state's
case,
and
that
under
hill
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
look
for
the
objective
factors
in
this
record
that
inform
the
decision
of
what
mr.
moore
would
have
done
or
would
have
been
likely
to
have
done
in
the
absence
of
his
counsel's
mistakes.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
your
honor,
the
answer
is
certainly
no,
we
do
not
litigate
all
of
the
motions.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
no,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
and
the
issue
here
is
not
as
we
have
attempted
to
articulate
in
our
brief
solely
and
in
the
abstract
the
failure
to
file
the
motion.
the
problem
is
that
mr.
moore's
attorney
did
not
understand
that
the
statement
was
suppressible.
in
the
situation
that
you
are
putting
to
me,
if
i
or
an
assistant
in
my
office
says
to
a
client,
look,
there
is
a
strong
motion
to
suppress
the
confession,
the
drugs,
what
have
you,
but
here
are
other
factors
that
we
should
look
at.
and
at
the
conclusion
and
with
that
proper
advice
the
client
decides
i
will
take
the
deal,
then
i
have
performed
effectively,
and
the
case
is
not
one
that
could
be
subject
to
a
collateral
attack
as
this
case
is.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
your
honor,
he
would
have
been
able
to
defend
this
case
first
by
articulating
the
government's
obligation
to
prove
his
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
you
take
out
the
confession
and
you
posit
it
in
your
questioning
of
attorney
general
kroger
that
the
strength
of
his
brother's
confession
is
a
given.
we
respectfully
disagree.
the
brother
raymond
is
a
police--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--the
brother
is
a
police
informant.
the
brother
describes
himself
in
the
deposition.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
the
police
had
used
them
as
their
agent.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
your
honor,
the
point
is
that
he--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--if
he
were
to
appear
and
testify,
which
is
one
of
the
points
that
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit
properly
pointed
out,
that
mr.
moore
knowing
his
brother
might
have
had
every
confidence--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--your
honor,
i
will
respond
to
the
second
part
but
i
believe
there
is
a
premise
in
which
you
said,
that
we
reject.
there
is
no
state
court
finding
under
hill.
and
there
is
no
deference--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--the
court
never
reached
the
hill
question.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
the
state--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--at
pages
205
and
206
in
the
appendix
in
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
there
are
11
findings
of
fact.
in
one
of
those
findings
of
fact,
in
findings
of
fact
8
and
9,
the
state
court
used
the
word
fruitless
in
describing
the
motion
to
suppress.
in
the
conclusions
of
law
the
state
court
solely
addressed
strickland.
and
nowhere
in
the
analysis
is
there
any
reference
to
the
question
of
what
mr.
moore
would
have
done.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
yes,
of
course.
however,
the
analysis
that
was
undertaken
here
never
reached
the
question
of
what
mr.
moore
would
have
done.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--your
honor,
there
is
no
question
that
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
strength
of
the
state's
case
includes
the
facts
that
the
attorney
general
has
identified.
there
is
also
as
we
perceive
it
no
question
but
that
the
objective
record
showed
that
the
brother's
testimony
would
have
been
highly
impeachable
based
on
his
prior
work
as
an
informant,
his
description
of
himself--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--your
honor,
i
cannot
point
in
the
record
to
a
motive.
what
i
can
point
to
is
the
fact
that
there
is
in
the
record
his
self-description
of
himself
as
the
golden
boy
for
the
police,
his
working
with
the
same
detective
who
interrogated
his
brother
years
before
when
he
completely
avoided
a
murder
charge.
and
as
a
defense
attorney,
in
a
case
involving
a
group
of
men
who
are
not
necessarily
as
socialized
and
well
educated
as
some
other
group,
that
his
testimony
would
have
been
subject
to
impeachment.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
the
defense
to
the
kidnapping
charge
in
the
absence
of
the
confessions
could
well
have
been
a
mere
presence
defense,
that
mr.
moore
did
not
participate
in
the
kidnapping.
he
had
every
right
to
put
the
state
to
his
--
to
its
burden
of
proof.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
he
could
certainly
have
argued
that
he
did
not
participate
in
the
kidnapping.
he's
there,
he's
in
the
car,
and
he
had
no
participation
in
it.
but
what
i
believe
is
being
missed
in
this
discussion,
if
i
may,
is
the
focus
on
the
question
required
to
be
analyzed
in
hill.
would
mr.
moore
have
gone
to
trial?
would
he
have
accepted
the
plea?
mr.
steven
t.
wax
and
on
that
there
are
highly--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--that
is
correct.
the
clearly
established
law
that
governs
here
is
strickland,
hill
and
kimmelman.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
yes,
your
honor.
what
we
have
in
this
record
is
highly
unusual
combination
of
four
facts
appearing
at
three
different
stages
in
the
proceeding.
first,
from
his
attorney,
who
articulated
this
in
the
sentencing
--
it's
in
the
supplemental
appendix
at
page
7:
mr.
moore
had
a
very
difficult
time
accepting
the
fact
that
this
was
a
felony
murder
charge,
or
a
felony
murder
offer.
that
leads
directly
to
the
fact
that
mr.
moore
did
not
plead
guilty.
this
is
only
a
nolo
plea.
and
while
in
some
circumstances
the
court
will
equate
a
nolo
plea
with
a
plea
of
guilty,
in
these
circumstances
the
fact
that
he
entered
a
nolo
plea
only
is
highly
significant
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
would
have
rolled
the
dice.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
your
honor--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--your
honor,
a
competent
counsel
might
advise
his
counsel
to
accept
a
plea.
the
question
of
the
irrational
client
is
however
one
with
which
i
regrettably
deal
on
a
regular
basis.
clients
do
not
always
accept
my
advice,
and
for
whatever
it
is
worth
in
the
footnote
toward
the
end
of
his
opinion,
judge
reinhardt
responds
to
judge
bybee
by
saying:
look,
he
may
not
be
better
off
by
pursuing
this
habeas
corpus
action;
it
is,
however,
his
choice.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
your
honor--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--i
am
not
advocating
for
the
test
articulated
by
judge
berzon;
i
believe
that
it
is
a
sound
approach
but
it
is
not
what
we
are
advocating
for
here.
we
believe
that
this
record
shows
that
mr.
moore
would
have
gone
to
trial.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
there
is
--
there
is
no
direct
statement
to
that
effect.
in
all
the
cases
where
we
have
found
where
there
is
such
a
direct
statement,
the
courts
almost
always
discount
them.
what
we
have
here,
we
submit,
is
something
more
significant,
and
that
is
he
did
not
want
to
enter
a
plea.
he
did
not
enter
a
plea,
and
then
at
the
first
opportunity
that
he
learned
that
his
attorney
had
been
ineffective,
he
moved
to
undo
the
conviction.
and
we
submit
that
the
decision
in
roe
v.
flores-ortega,
in
which
this
court
found
it
highly
significant
that
flores-ortega
moved
to
initiate
an
appeal
at
the
first
opportunity
that
he
learned
that
the
appeal
had
been
lost,
is
applicable
here.
that
is
an
objective
fact
that
this
court
has
found
relevant
--
and--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--your
honor,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--i
believe
that
mr.
moore
was
making
a
reasoned
judgment.
his
codefendant
brother
who
brought
the
gun
to
the
scene,
who
by
the
confessions,
is
the
one
who
pistol-whipped
the
victim,
received
the
10-year
manslaughter
sentence
that
mr.
moore
believed
he
should
have
obtained.
mr.
salyer,
who
went
to
trial,
received
the
same
sentence
that
mr.
moore
received.
mr.
moore's
judgment
that
this
should
be
viewed
as
an
accident
and
that
it
was
a
highly
mitigated
situation--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--your
honor,
the
gun
is
brought
to
the
scene
--
and
this
is
in
the
record

by
the
codefendant,
lonnie
woolhiser.
he
has
the
gun
when
he
goes
into
the
trailer
and
assaults
mr.
rogers.
what
the
district
attorney
said,
the
prosecutor
on
the
scene
who
understood
what
was
happening,
the
prosecutor's
description
at
pages
227
and
228
of
the
appendix
is:
this
is
an
accident.
the
prosecutors
states:
they
had
no
intent
to
kill.
the
sole
intent
here
was
to
put
the
fear
of
god
into
mr.
rogers
for
his
having
ripped
off
his
friend
mr.
salyer.
the
prosecutor
describes
the
incident
on
the
hill
as
follows:
that
mr.
woolhiser,
with
the
gun,
is
pushing
mr.
rogers
up
the
hill.
this
is
a
wet
and
muddy

day
and

and
mr.
woolhiser
go
down--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--pages
227
and
228
in
the
appendix.
and
he
also
reiterates
the
fact
in
the
sentencing,
which
i
believe
is
at
--
at
page
3
and
4,
the
sentencing
proceeding
in
the--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--if
he
goes
to
trial,
the
likelihood,
first,
of
a
death
penalty
needs
to
be
put
off
the
table.
mr.
steven

wax
if
he
is
convicted
solely
of
the
kidnapping,
if
he
is
convicted
of
an
assault,
he
can
receive
a
lighter
sentence.
if
he
is
convicted
of
the
felony
murder,
to
be
sure
the
mandatory--
mr.
steven

--yes.
but

him
guilty
of
that,
his
sentence

mr.
steven

he
could
have
argued
a
mere
presence
defense.
in
the
absence--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--well,
your
honor,
the
record
shows
there
was
one
witness
who
put
him
at
the
scene.
the
record
shows
that
one
of
the
issues
that
was
previously
raised,
and
that
in
our
winnowing
of
the
issues
is
not
currently
before
this
court,
is
a
challenge
to
the
admissibility
of
the
eyewitness
identification
at
the
rogers
trailer.
one
witness
there
only,
and
that
would
be
subject
to
challenge,
and
does
not
put
him
into
the
trailer
or
participating
in
the
kidnapping
or
the
assault.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
i
believe
you
should
give
no
credit
to
that,
because
that
statement
by
mr.
moore
is
based
on
the
incorrect
advice
of
his
attorney.
and
we
believe
that
the
record
here--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--your
honor,
he
had
previously
been
told
by
his
attorney
that
they
were
not.
and
when
he
was
questioned
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding
before
the
point
of
the
prejudice
under
hill,
he
says:
i
acted
and
entered
this
nolo
plea
on
the
advice
of
counsel.
now,
to
be
sure
there
is
a
boilerplate
statement
to
the
contrary.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
your
honor,
what
mr.
moore
has
said
is:
i
enter
this
plea
on
the
advice
of
my
attorney.
that
advice
is
conceded
by
the
state
to
have
been
incorrect,
and
the
full
record
of
the
case
includes
that
plea
petition
document.
it
includes
the
state's
concession
that
the
advice
provided
was
incorrect.
and
while
a
plea
petition
form
is
standard
in
many
state
courts,
as
it
is
in
the
federal
court,
the
reality
is
that
those
forms
often
include
statements
that
are
not
consistent
with
the
facts
that
have
been
presented
or
that
have
occurred
previously.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
he
affirmatively
states
that
there
was
no
intent
to
kill.
mr.
steven
t.
wax
i
believe
it's
on
page
228,
where
he
comes
back
in
and
says
one
more
thing.
it
is
on
228.
and
just
something
that
i
missed
early
on:
"the
indicated
intent
of
the
defendant
was
to
instill
fear
to
the
point
that
the
victim
would
not
again
rip
them
off.
"
the
description--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--yes,
sir.
and
i
believe
it
is
also
consistent
with
the
statement
of
the
judge
at
the
sentencing,
who
described
this
as
a
case
involving
two
tragedies.
everyone
who
participated
--
the
lawyers
for
the
defendants,
the
prosecutor,
and
the
judge
--
recognized
this
was
an
accident.
this
was
a
tragedy.
the
judge
saying,
mr.
moore,
the
person
who
had
led
a
good,
law-abiding
life,
a
person
who
had
been
a
productive
member
of--
mr.
steven
t.
wax
--well,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
is
the
portion
to
the
record
to
which
i
am
referring
at
page
228.
he
also
described
at
the
sentencing
the
facts
of
the
case
as
facts
involving
and
consistent
with
the
slip
and
the
fall.
his
description
of
the
incident
is
a
description
of
mr.
rogers
falling
back
into
the
gun.
he
did
that
both
at
the
plea,
which
i
believe
is
on
page
227,
and
he
did
it
again
at
the
sentencing.
and
then
he
is
followed
by
the
judge,
who
articulates
the
circumstances
of
this
case
as
involving
two
tragedies:
to
be
sure,
the
death
of
mr.
rogers,
but
also
the
tragedy
of
mr.
moore
having
accidentally
killed
his
friend.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
