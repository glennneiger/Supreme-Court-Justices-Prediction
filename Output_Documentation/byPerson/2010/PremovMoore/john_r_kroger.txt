mr.
john
r.
kroger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
arizona
v.
fulminante
was
the
clearly
established
federal
law
to
control
and
govern
the
outcome
of
this
case.
this
was
an
error,
because
this
court
has
never
applied
fulminante's
direct
appeal
harmless
error
standard,
which
places
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
government,
to
a
collateral
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
where
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
inmate.
in
boyer,
unlike
fulminante,
there
is
no
trial
transcript
to
review
because
the
defendant
pleaded
no
contest
or
guilty
before
trial.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
conflicts
with
both
strickland
v.
washington
and
hill
v.
lockhart
and
will
have
grave
negative
consequences
for
our
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
relevant
to
that
extent,
that
a
confession
from
a
defendant
is
significant
evidence.
however,
it
certainly
does
not
imply,
as
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded
to
do
here,
that
it
controls
the
prejudice
prong
of
strickland,
that
it
sets
a
new
standard
of
review
of
harmlessness,
that
it
shifts
the
burden
of
proof
onto
the
government,
or
that
it
limits
the
prejudice
analysis
to
that
question
of
the
potential
impact
of
the
confession
at
trial.
and
so
for
all
those
reasons,
i
--
i
think
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
has
gone
well
beyond
any
potential
relevance
of
the
fulminante
decision.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
your
honor,
we're
--
we
are
suggesting
that
the
court
was
wrong
both
in
stating
fulminante
provided
the
standard
of
review,
as
well
as
holding
that
you
can,
in
effect,
assume
prejudice
simply
because
defense
counsel
failed
to
file
a
motion
which
defense
counsel
believed
was
not--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
as
--
as
your
honor
noted,
that
is
a
much
higher
standard
than
we
have
to
meet
under
hill
v.
lockhart.
there
were
very
good
reasons
why
defense
counsel's
advice
to
this
defendant
plead
guilty
was
sound
and
reasonable
advice.
first
of
all,
the
defendant
faced
a
very
strong
government
case,
even
at
that
stage
of
the
investigation.
second,
there
was
a
potential
charge
of
aggravated
murder
that
could
be
brought
if
the
case
were
taken
to
the
grand
jury.
third,
the
plea
offer
that
was
extended
to
the
defendant
and
which
the
defendant
took
was
very
favorable
to
the
defendant,
both
in
terms
of
--
of
capping
the
amount
of
time
that
the
defendant
would
serve,
as
well
as
dismissing
two
additional
mandatory
minimum
charges
of
assault
and
kidnapping.
so--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--no,
your
honor,
but
they
could
have
been
run
consecutive
rather
than
concurrent.
i
--
i
think
more
significant
is
the
fact
that
when
the
defendant
himself
testified
about
the
reasons
he
pled
guilty,
none
of
the
reasons
he
provided
had
anything
to
do
with
the
strength
of
the
government's
case
or
the
failure
of
counsel
to
file
the
motion.
what
the
defendant
said
motivated
his
guilty
plea
was
a
concern
about
an
aggravated
murder
charge,
a
desire
not
to
have
to
testify
against
his
brother,
which
he
believed
would
be
the
outcome
of
a
guilty
plea.
and
those
factors
were
in
the
defendant's
mind
when
he
decided
to
take
the
guilty
plea.
so
in
this
case,
even
if
one
were
to
shift
the
burden
onto
the
government
--
and
i
do
not
believe
that
--
that
that
is
consistent
with
strickland
--
the
government
would
prevail
here.
this
case
raises,
i
think,
significant
consequences
for
application
of
strickland
and
hill
v.
lockhart.
strickland
and
hill
clearly
place
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
collateral
proceeding
on
the
inmate.
the
court
of
appeals
here
shifted
the
burden
of
proof,
pursuant
to
fulminante,
onto
the
government.
one
can
see
this
in
the
petition
appendix
at
page
48
where
the
court
states
that
there
is
not
enough
evidence
in
the
record
to
prove
that
the
defendant
would
have
pled
guilty
had
the
confession
been
denied.
as
i
stated
to
justice
sotomayor,
i
believe
the
government
actually
could
meet
that
burden,
but
that
is
certainly
not
the
burden
that
either
strickland
or
--
or
hill
requires.
second,
the
court's
application
of
fulminante
transforms
the
hill
v.
lockhart
analysis.
it
narrows
it
to
one
degree,
because
it's
focused
on
one
issue,
what
the
government's
evidence
would
be
at
trial,
rather
than
looking
at
the
broad
array
of
issues
which
might
motivate
a
defendant
to
plead
guilty
which
the
courts
will
look
at
under
--
under
hill
v.
lockhart.
for
example,
under
hill
v.
lockhart
the
court
will
not
only
look
at
the
defendant's
testimony
with
respect
to
the
estimate
of
the
strength
of
the
government's
case,
but
also
look
at
the
potential
for
an
additional
sentence
that
is
higher
or
additional
charges
that
carry
a
higher
sentence
if
the
defendant
proceeds
with
litigation
rather
than
pleading
guilty.
it
will
look
at
the
investigation
risk
that
additional
evidence
would
be
found
in,
if
the
case
continued
rather
than
terminating
in
an
early
plea.
and
it
will
look
at
personal
factors
as
the
ones
that
were
evident
in
this
case
that
might
motivate
a
guilty
plea.
for
those
reasons,
the
hill
v.
lockhart
standard
encompasses
a
broader
array
of
factors
in
determining
whether
there
is
prejudice
than
a
simple
application
of
fulminante's
direct
appeal
post-trial
standards.
it
is
also
the
case
that
the
application
of
fulminante
will
substantially
increase
the
amount
of
speculation
which
courts
have
to
engage
in
compared
with
applying
the
proper
hill
v.
lockhart
test.
hill
v.
lockhart
limits
the
amount
of
speculation
by
focusing
on
the
defendant's
motive
in
pleading
guilty
and
whether
the
ineffective
assistance
could
have
influenced
that
decision
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
your
honor,
i
would
say
two
things:
first,
the
test
which
is
proposed
by
judge
berzon
in
the
concurrence
has
never
been
recognized
or
promulgated
by
this
court.
so
in
a
collateral
proceeding
pursuant
to
28
u.s.
code
2254,
it
would
not
be
clearly
established
law
that
the
state
court
was
required
to
follow.
and
second,
application
of
that
standard,
as
judge
bybee
noted
in
his
concurrence,
would
require
an
immense
amount
of
speculation.
in
this
case,
the
majority
in
the
ninth
circuit
hypothesized
that
filing
the
motion
to
suppress
the
confession
would
strengthen
the
defendant's
position
in
negotiation
vis-a-vis
the
government.
it
is
also
very
possible,
however,
that
the
government
would
respond
to
filing
a
motion
as
opposed
to
taking
an
early
offer
of
guilty
plea
by
taking
the
case
to
the
grand
jury,
seeking
an
aggravated
murder
charge,
and
thus,
putting
the
defendant
in
a
worse
position
in
the
case.
and,
in
fact,
as
judge
bybee
noted,
he
questioned
whether
the
courts
have
the
proper
tools
to
be
able
to
speculate
years
after
the
guilty
plea
whether
a
particular
motion
may
have
increased
or
may
have
decreased
the
amount
of
leverage
that
a
defendant
has,
or
what
kind
of
response
that
that
motion
might
have
drawn
from
the
prosecution.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
your
honor--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--i
think
the
alternative,
your
honor,
is
application
of
hill
v.
lockhart,
which
looks
not
at
speculation
about
how
this
could
or
could
not
have
affected
the
plea
bargaining
process,
but
looks
very
concretely
at
the
defendant's
pretrial
decision-making
process
and
examines
the
record
to
determine
why
the
defendant
pled
guilty
and
whether
they
can
prove
with
a
reasonable
probability
that
he
would
not
have
pled
guilty--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--i
--
i
think
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
when
you
are
applying
hill
v.
lockhart,
you
almost
always
have
at
least
three
very
concrete
pieces
evidence
to
show
the
defendant's
state
of
mind.
you
have
the
defendant's
own
testimony
or
deposition,
or
in
this
case
both.
you
have
the
trial
counsel's
affidavit
for
testimony
about
the
decision-making
process
his
client
engaged
in,
and
then
you
have
the
guilty
plea
colloquy
itself.
so
you
always
have
a
--
a
concrete
record
that
the
court
years
later
can
review
in
order
to
determine
what
motivated
the
--
the
decision
to
plead
guilty.
if
one
were
applying
judge
berzon's
proposed
alternative
prejudice
finding,
one
would
have
to
engage
in
a
great
deal
of
speculation.
one
would,
i
presume,
have
defense
counsel
and
the
government
make
claims
about
what
they
might
have
done
in
response
to
hypotheticals,
which
does
not
seem
to
be
a
--
a
--
a
reasonably
judicable
standard.
as
a--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--your
honor,
if
none
of
--
none
of
the
three
confessions--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--your
honor,
i
still
think
taking,
recommending
a
guilty
plea
and
taking
of
a
guilty
plea
would
be
a
rational
response
to
the
remaining
evidence.
even
at
this
early
stage
in
the
proceeding,
the
police
had
uncovered
certainly
the
body
with
the
direct
shot
to
the
temple.
it
had
recovered
the
--
the
murder
weapon.
it
had
recovered
the
car
which
the
defendants
had
borrowed
and
which
had
blood
in
the
trunk
where
the
victim
had
been
locked
and
transported.
they
had
four
witnesses
who
were
present
when
the
plan
to
kidnap
and
assault
the
victim
was
hatched.
so
they
would
have
testified
very
directly
about
the
forming
of
the
plot.
there
was
an
eyewitness
who
identified
the
defendant,
mr.
moore,
at
the
trailer
where
the
victim
was
abducted.
and
then,
of
course,
there
was
a
co-conspirator,
mr.
salyer,
who
was
cooperating
with
the
government
prior
to
the
confession
and
whose
--
whose
cooperation
was
known
to
the
defendant.
so,
with
all
of
those
pieces,
even
if
one
stripped
the
three
confessions
out
of
the
case,
you
would
still
have
a
situation
where
the
government
's
case
was
strong,
where
there
was
a
very
severe
risk
the
government
would
go
to
the
grand
jury
and
obtain
an
aggravated
murder
charge,
and
where
there
was
significant
advantages
to
pleading
early
and
locking
in
a
lower
sentence
to
a
felony
murder
charge.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
no,
your
honor.
we
--
we
concede
and
forfeited
the
issue
that
the
--
the
motion
to
suppress
would
have
been
meritorious,
but
believed
the
district
court
got
it
right
when
it
held
that
on
both
prongs
of
strickland,
both
on
deficient
performance
and
on
prejudice,
the
defendant
has
failed
to
make
his
--
his
--
meet
his
burden
of
proof.
i
think
the
--
the
prejudice
argument
here
is
extraordinarily
strong,
but
i
think
the
deficient
performance,
even
if
one
concedes
that
the
motion
would
have
been
meritorious,
the
deficient
performance
prong
is
strong
as
well,
because
the
defendant
can't
meet
his
burden
of
proof
that
defense
counsel's
representation
was
unreasonable,
given
the
strength
of
the
government's
case,
given
the
quality
of
the
plea
offer
that
was
made,
and
given
the
defendant's
own
reasoning
for
why
he
pled
guilty.
the
case
has
significant
practical
consequences
for
the
criminal
justice
system.
one
is
that
if
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
stands,
it
will
be
much
easier
to
challenge
guilty
pleas
years
after
the
fact
on
collateral
challenge,
and
this
will
undercut
the
principle
of
finality.
one
would
certainly
expect
to
see
fewer
government
plea
offers
in
cases
like
this,
if
the
government
believed
years
later
it
would
have
to
present
all
of
its
trial
evidence
in
a
collateral
proceeding
in
order
to
rebut
the
presumption
under
fulminante
that
there
was
prejudice.
second,
it
has
severe
implications
for
the
freedom
of
defense
counsel
to
exercise
its
discretion
and
represent
its
client
using
the
wide
latitude
that
strickland
recognized
was
necessary.
strickland
itself
stated
that
it's
a
mistake
to
hem
in
defense
counsel
with
strict
rules
about
what
should
or
should
not
be
done,
because
defense
counsel
needs
that
wide
latitude.
if
there
is
a
--
a
virtual
presumption
that
motions
to
suppress
must
be
filed,
even
where
defense
counsel
reasonably
believes
it
will
not
resound
to
the
advantage
of
his
client
and
may
cost
the
client
a
chance
to
plea
early,
the
defense
counsel
must
take
that
option,
it's
a
severe
restriction
on
the--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--your
honor,
if
he
had
gone
to
trial
on
the
charges
that
were
pending,
and
these
--
these
were
not
charges
from
the
grand
jury,
he
would
have
faced
at
least
the
mandatory
minimum
of
25
years
that
he
pled
guilty
to,
plus
the
potential
of
additional
--
an
additional
sentence
both
on
that
charge
perhaps
as
high
as
life,
given
the
two
other
potential
mandatory
minimum
sentences
of
--
of
kidnapping
and
assault
that
could
be
brought.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
this
case
pled
guilty
before,
your
honor,
yes.
so--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--it
could
have
been
a
capital
case,
your
honor.
this
could
have
been
an
aggravated
murder
case
because
the
facts
involved
a
very
severe
beating
to
the
extent
perhaps
of
torture
where
a
defendant
who
was
very
vulnerable
who
had
a
protruding
hernia
that
was
in
a
truss
was
savagely
beaten,
his
nose
was
broken,
he
was
locked
in
the
trunk
of
the
car,
taken
to
a
remote
location
and
shot
in
the
temple
with
one
shot
of
a
revolver.
it
is
distinctly
possible
that
the
state
would
have
come
from
the
grand
jury
as
a
capital
case
and
at
the
very
least
have
been
an
aggravated
murder
carrying
a
life
sentence,
not
a
25-year
sentence.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
salyer
did
receive
the
same
sentence
after
he
went
to
trial.
his
case,
though,
was
very
different
from
that
of
the
petitioner,
because
the
petitioner
was
the
individual
who
cocked
the
pistol
and
fired
the
round
into
the
head
of
the
victim
killing
him.
and
so
it
is
very
unlikely
that
the
other
two
co-conspirators
would
have
found
themselves
charged
with
an
intentional
murder
based
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
but
because
this
pistol
could
only
be
fired
if
it
were
cocked
and
because
the
round
went
into
the
temple,
it
would
have
been
a
reasonably
strong
aggravated
murder
case
against
this
defendant
who
was
the
triggerman.
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
make
to
the
court
is
that
this
case
involves
or
should
involve
significant
deference
to
the
state
court
decision.
this
was
not
a
summary
denial
by
the
state
court.
the
state
court
held
a
hearing
at
which
it
received
all
testimony
that
was
available.
it
made
very
explicit
findings
of
fact
about
the
facts
in
the
case.
it
made
a
credibility
finding
about
the
evidence
that
had
been
submitted
by
the
petitioner,
and
it
ruled
after
citing
the
proper
strickland
standard
that
the
defendant
had
failed
to
carry
his
burden
of
proof.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
your
honor,
even
if
you--
mr.
john
r.
kroger
--your
honor,
i
would
say
two
things
with
respect
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
state
court's
decision,
even
if
it
were
incorrect
in
its
ruling
that
the
confession
would
not
have
been
admissible,
the
state
court's
conclusion
that
the
motion
would
not
have
assisted
the
defendant
in
any
way,
the
finding
that
it
would
have
been
fruitless
because
of
the
other
confessions,
the
other
two
confessions
in
the
case,
is
a
reasonable
decision
that
the
court
made
and
is
dispositive
and
thus
under
aedpa
should
receive
deference.
i
would
also
suggest
the
case
is
somewhat
similar
to
yarborough
v.
alvarado.
there
was
a
custody
issue
at
stake
and
this
court
explicitly
held
that
one
might
come
out
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
custody
issue,
that
reasonable
jurists
might
split,
but
that
that
fact
alone
rendered
the
state
court's
opinion
on
voluntariness
or
on
custody
in
that
issue
as
reasonable.
and
again,
as
here,
though
we
are
not
asserting
that
this
confession
was
admissible,
should
the
court
consider
it,
it's
clearly
a
close
question
on
voluntariness
and
somewhat
factually
similar
to
yarborough
where
even
if
the
state
court
were
was
wrong,
it
was
still
a
reasonable
adjudication
of
the
claims.
if
there
were
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
r.
kroger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
here
did
not
apply
clearly
established
federal
law,
but
applied,
for
the
first
time
in
a
way
that
is
non-mandated
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
fulminante
to
a
collateral
proceeding.
the
state
court's
adjudication
of
this
claim
was
eminently
reasonable
on
both
prongs
of
strickland.
accordingly,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
any
additional
questions
that
the
court
may
have.
