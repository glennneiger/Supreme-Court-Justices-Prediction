yes,
but
judge
reinhardt
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
in
fact
apply
the
test
of
hill,
which
you
are
asserting.
the
test
is
whether
he
would
have
gone
to
trial.
i
--
i
didn't
read
the
opinion
as
ever
saying
that
he
would
have
gone
to
trial.
the
opinion
says
he
could
have
gotten
a
better
deal.
that's
quite
a
different
--
quite
a
different
question,
and
i
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
make
that
the
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
not
the
test
that
--
that
hill
prescribed.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wax,
as
far
as
the
confession
is
concerned
and
its
excludability,
what
effect
do
you
think
we
ought
to
give
to
this
passage
in
the
--
in
the
defendant's
agreement
to
the
plea:
"i
understand
that
any
admissions,
statements,
or
confessions
which
i
may
have
made
or
any
evidence
obtained
by
virtue
of
the
search
and
seizure
of
my
property
may
well
be
inadmissible
against
me
in
evidence,
unless
my
constitutional
rights
have
been
safeguarded.
"
"i
understand
that
if
i
would
like
to
speak
to
an
attorney
concerning
my
constitutional
rights,
that
the
court
will
grant
me
time
for
that
purpose.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
wait.
this
is
not
the
attorney
speaking.
i
mean,
this
is
what
he
said.
he
said,
"i
understand
that
any
admissions,
statements
or
confessions
which
i
have
made
may
well
be
--
may
well
be
inadmissible
against
me
in
evidence.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
boilerplate
--
i
mean,
the
man
signed
it.
how
can
a
prosecutor
ever
protect
himself
against
the
person
who
signs
a
plea
agreement
later
--
later
coming
in
and
saying:
oh,
my
attorney
misadvised
me.
i
don't
care
what
your
attorney
advised
you.
the
plea
agreement
itself
advises
you
that
this
stuff
may
be
inadmissible.
