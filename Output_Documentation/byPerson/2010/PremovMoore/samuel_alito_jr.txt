justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
does
your
office
do
in
this
situation,
all
right,
a
client
is
indicted
in
federal
court
and
you
anticipate
that
there
are
all
sorts
of
motions
that
you
might
make
if
this
case
is
going
to
trial,
but
at
an
early
point
the
prosecution
offers
you
what
looks
like
a
really
good
plea
bargain.
now
do
you
litigate
all
those
motions?
if
you
have,
you
know,
you
have
a
chance
of
winning,
of
suppressing
some
statements
that
your
client
made,
suppressing
physical
evidence,
getting
certain
evidence
excluded
with
a
motion
in
limine,
maybe
you
could
win
on
a
severance
motion,
do
you
think
you
litigate
all
those
rather
than
grabbing
a
good
plea
deal
when
it's
offered
to
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
you
take
the
deal,
then
you
want
it
later
to
be
open
to
the
defendant
if
he's
not,
you
know,
after
the
defendant
has
spent
some
time
in
jail,
he's
not
too
happy
with
the
deal
any
more,
he
can
now
come
back
and
say,
well,
the
federal
public
defender's
office
was
ineffective
because
they
could
have
moved
to
suppress
my
confession
and
the
illegal
search,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
that
is
all
open
for
relitigation
years
later?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
without
his
testimony,
isn't
there
a
very
strong
case
of
kidnapping?
let's
just
take
it
step-by-step.
what
would
have
been
the
defense
to
the
kidnapping
charge?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
he
didn't
--
that
he
didn't
go
to
the
--
to
the
victim's
rv
with
the
other
men?
that
would
have
been
the
defense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
excuse
me.
where
was
the
citation
for
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
just
clarify
something?
is
it
your
position
that
the
prosecutor,
in
making
his
offer
of
proof
at
the
plea
on
227
to
228,
affirmatively
said
that
this
was
an
accident
or
did
not
--
did
not
allege
that
it
was
intentional?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
is
that?
i--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
read
that
as
a
--
as
a
claim
that
there
was
no
intent
to
kill?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
have
to
say,
i
think
that's
a
very
aggressive
reading
of
what
was
said
here.
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
plea
to
this
offense
to
prove
an
intent
to
kill,
and
the
statement
that
the
intent
that
was
necessary,
which
is
lesser
intent
but
sufficient
to
support
this
plea,
was
present
is
not
a
statement
that
a
greater
mens
rea
was
absent.
and
i
thought
you
argued
to
us
that
the
prosecutor
said
this
was
not
intentional.
it
was
an
accident.
