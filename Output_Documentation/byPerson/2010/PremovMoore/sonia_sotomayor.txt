justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
it
--
if
i
am
understanding
your
argument,
it
is
that
the
court
erred
in
assuming
that
if
the
confession
had
been
suppressed
--
which
you're
not
arguing
for
or
against.
i'm
assuming
you
are
not
taking
your
amicus's
position
that
we
have
to
get
to
the
question
of
what
would
have
happened
in
a
motion
to
suppress
--
but
that
under
all
circumstances,
if
there's
a
suppressible
confession,
a
defendant
should
never
plead
guilty.
you
are
saying
that
that
conclusion
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
drew
and
that
was
wrong?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
another
way
of
saying
what
i
said,
which
is,
no
defendant
should
plead
guilty
if
it's
a
suppressible
confession?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
now,
what
is
the
other
information
that
would
have
made
a
plain
guilty
in
this
case
inevitable?
however,
that's
a
higher
standard
than
you
need
to
meet,
but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--were
those
higher
than
the
minimum
he
pled
to?
were
those
mandatory
minimums
higher?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
without
any
confession
--
forget
about
the
brother
or
the
girlfriend
--
assume
that
there
had
been
no
confession,
wouldn't
it
have
been
a
fair
conclusion
to
draw
that
without
any
confession
whatsoever
that
the
plea
bargaining
strength
of
the
defendant
in
this
case
would
have
been
appreciably
higher
and
that
the
prosecutor
would
have
had
to
offer
something--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--none
of
the
three--
mr.
kroger
--
had
been
made.
--whatsoever.
i
mean,
if
the
brother's
confession
--
or
the
confession
to
the
brother
is
a
very
big
piece
of
why
a
plea
would
have
been
reasonable
in
this
case.
let's
assume
no
confession.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
am
having
a
little
bit
of
trouble
here
with
your
argument
for
the
following
reasons.
assume
we
suppress
the
confession.
why
is
it
unreasonable
for
the
defense
attorney
to
have
concluded
that
the
evidence
showing
your
client's
presence
at
the
shooting,
and
identification
as
the
shooter,
that
it
was
solely
that
he
should
have
gone
to
trial
on
a
defense
that
he
wasn't
involved
in
the
shooting
at
all.
once
you
put
him
in
this
shooting,
then
the
only
issue
he
seems
to
be
confused
about
is
that
he
thinks
that
because
it
was
accidental
that
that
presents
a
defense
to
felony
murder.
and
that's
clearly
an
erroneous
position
on
his
part.
so
what
made
the
case
so
weak
that
the
government
was
never
going
without
the
confession
to
prove
felony
murder?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
have
been
the
defense?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
have
been
the
defense
absent
the
confession?
you
have
one
at
trial
on
the
confession,
suppressing
it,
how
would
he
have
defended
the
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
motive
would
his
brother
have
had
to
put
him
at
the
scene
of
this
shooting
as
the
accidental
killer?
that's
all
his
brother
would
have
had
to
say.
he
was
at
the
scene,
he
accidentally
--
this
gun
went
accidentally
off.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
his
brother
had
no
pending
charges
against
him
at
the
time.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
what
interest
does
his
brother
have
when
he
has
no
pending
charges
against
him
at
the
time,
he's
going
to
use
this
as
a
future
chip
in
case
he
does
something
wrong?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
to
put
his
brother
into
jail
for
25
years?
this
is
illogical,
counsel.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
impeachable
how?
what
motive
did
he
have
to
implicate
his
brother?
you
still
haven't
answered
that
question.
all
you
keep
saying
is,
he
was
a
past
cooperator,
he
had
no
pending
charges,
and
now
he
has
a
motive
to
do
this
against
his
brother
because
of
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
a
competent
--
and
a
competent
counsel
is
supposed
to
accept
their
irrational
client,
who
doesn't
want
to
understand
the
law,
and
let
him
risk
getting
an
aggravated
felony
charge
brought
against
him,
or
a
capital
murder
charge
brought
against
him,
and
not
--
and
just
go
ahead?
and
try
the
case
because
he's
not
going
to
recommend
to
the
client,
go
to
trial,
take
the
plea,
because
you're
irrational?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
really
what
you
are
saying,
that
a
competent
attorney
would
not
recommend
to
his
client
take
the
plea,
and
that
his
client
wouldn't
ultimately
accept
the
plea,
because
the
objective
reality
is
his
upside
horrible
and
his
downside
is
almost
a
given.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
four
witnesses
put
him
at
the
scene
to
kidnap
this
guy
and
scare
him
to
death.
or
scare
him.
