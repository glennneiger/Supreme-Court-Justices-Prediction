justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
have
to,
don't
you?
i
mean,
what's
the
alternative?
i
mean,
imagine
a
case
where
it's
clear
there
was
a
malpractice
or
an
inadequate
assistance,
and
it
happened
a
long
time
ago
and
now
you
have
to
decide,
well,
was
it
prejudicial
or
not?
it's
prejudicial
if
in
the
absence
of
that
he
would
have
gone
to
trial
or
wouldn't
have
pleaded
guilty,
or
--
and
what's
the
alternative
to
trying
to
figure
out
whether
that's
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
can't
be
the
state
always
wins
and
it
can't
be
the
defendant
always
wins.
so
--
so
what's
the
alternative?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
that
is
--
isn't
that
--
sorry,
maybe
we
are
just
quibbling.
i
--
i
don't
quite
see
it.
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
going
into
the
plea
bargaining
process.
would
he
have
pleaded
guilty,
what
would
have
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
--
if
he
had
gone
to
trial,
what's
the
sentence
--
what's
the
range
of
sentence
he
could
have
gotten?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
they
had
gone
back
to
the
grand
jury,
as
the
prosecutor
i
guess
could
have
done,
it
could
have
gone
to
the
grand
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
could
have
gone
to
the
grand
jury.
then
what
is
the
maximum
he
could
have
gotten?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
might.
see,
that's
the
trouble.
we
have
a
lot
of
evidence,
i
think,
here,
at
least
by
first
glance,
that
--
a
lot
of
evidence
he
shot
the
guy.
a
lot
of
evidence
he
carried
--
kidnapped
him.
all
right?
and
now
the
--
now,
maybe
it
was
accidental,
but
if
it
was
accidental,
it's
still
felony
murder;
and
he
received
through
the
plea
bargaining
the
minimum
sentence
he
could
get
for
that.
you
started
out
by
saying
that
the
--
the
state
court's
conclusion
that
this
was
not
prejudicial
was
clearly
wrong.
all
right.
if
it's
clearly
wrong,
what
is
it
so
clear,
that
he
could
get
off
if
he
went
to
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
state
court
finding
that
this
was
not
prejudicial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
talking
about
hill.
i
don't
know
the
names
of
the
cases
associated.
i
thought
that
the
court
in
the
state
court
said
--
but
i
might
be
wrong;
i'd
like
to
know
--
made
a
finding
that
one,
this
was
not
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
two,
it
was
not
prejudicial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
i
haven't
read
this
very
thoroughly,
so
--
so
you
--
yet
--
so
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
strickland
require
that
it
be
prejudicial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
assume
that
the
word
"fruitless"
and
the
reference
to
strickland
were
a
finding,
that
this
is
not
prejudicial
--
if
i
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
argument
for
the
moment,
what
is
it
that
you
can
show
that
shows
it
was
prejudicial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
the
same
question
i
think
justice
--
justice
sotomayor
started
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i've
got
on
the
other
--
i've
got
--
the
other
reason
i
asked
the
question,
to
be
clear
about
it,
is
that
--
is
that
he
wouldn't
have
gone
to
trial
in
my
mind
unless
he
had
a
pretty
good
chance
of
getting
a
better
deal.
and
what
he
--
like
getting
off.
and
what
he
got
was
the
minimum.
okay?
one
thing
i've
written
down
is
that
the
state
would
not
have
the
confession.
that's
correct.
number
two
is
he
could
say
his
brother
is
not
a
very
good
brother.
moreover
he's
a
rather
dubious
character
there,
and
bring
all
that
--
stuff.
was
there
anything
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
miss
anything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
an
irrelevant
question.
i
don't
see
how
we
could
go
back
to
a
possibly
irrational
state
of
mind.
i
mean,
don't
--
when
you're
trying
to
figure
out
what
a
defendant
would
have
done
in
the
absence
of
an
error
in
respect
to
a
plea,
don't
you
have
to
ask
a
question:
what
would
a
rational
person
have
done.
i
mean,
i
would
say
that's
a
good
question.
i
don't
know
the
answer,
but
if
we
are
trying
to
figure
out
he
might
have
been
totally
irrational
and
would
have
gone
to
trial
even
though
he
was
likely
to
end
up
in
jail
for
life
as
opposed
to
25
years,
we
should
then
reverse
it
and
give
him
a
trial?
i'm
rather
disturbed
by
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
actually
think
about
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
believe
it.
the
jury
believes
it
was
an
accident.
now,
how
does
that
get
him
a
lighter
sentence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
sentence
is
25
years
mandatory
for
felony
murder.
now,
the
jury
believes
just
what
you
said.
it
believes
it
was
an
accident;
he
never
intended
to
pull
the
trigger.
how
does
that
get
him
a
lighter
sentence?
that's
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
kidnapping
a
felony?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then,
if
he
is
kidnapped
--
if
he
is
convicted
of
the
kidnapping
and
there
was
an
accidental
murder
that
took
place,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
felony
murder.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
and
the
defense
to
kidnapping
was
what?
