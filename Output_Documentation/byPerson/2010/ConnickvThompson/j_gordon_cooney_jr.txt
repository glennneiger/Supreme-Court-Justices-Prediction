mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
the
petitioner's
brief
attempts
to
relitigate
factual
issues
that
were
resolved
against
them
by
the
jury,
they
have
raised
today
only
one
question
of
law,
and
that
is
whether
this
court
should
write
into
section
1983
a
per
se
rule
that
the
only
way,
the
only
way,
a
civil
rights
victim
can
ever
establish
the
deliberate
indifference
of
a
district
attorney
is
if
he
can
prove
a
prior
significant
history
of
assistant
prosecutors
violating
other
citizens'
constitutional
rights.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
would
submit
that--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--but
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
this
court's
--
that
their
requirement
for
proving
deliberate
indifference
is,
first,
contrary
to
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
canton
and
subsequent
cases.
it
finds
no
place
in
the
language
of
section
1983--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--your
honor--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--it
is
absolutely
a
deliberate
indifference
to
the
need
to
train
and
provide
other
protections--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all
i
think
canton
says
you
have
to
look
at
the
specific
circumstances.
and
so
i
don't
think
there
is
a
one-size-fits-all
way
or
message
that
has
to
be
provided.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
well,
first--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--in
this
office,
your
honor,
i
think
the
first
thing
one
has
to
confront
is
mr.
connick's
testimony,
and
in
fact
the
concession
that
the
petitioners
made
on
pages
6
and
7
of
their
merits
brief
that
the
office
started
with
what
the
brief
described
as:
"connick's
disclosure
policies
were
no
mystery.
"
"turn
over
what
the
law
required
and
nothing
more.
"
i
mean,
that
would
be--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--and
mr.
chief
justice,
with
--
if
--
first
of
all,
i
wouldn't
start
with
that
rule.
but
if
i
started
with
that
rule
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
me--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
it's
an
unlawful
rule.
however,
it
requires
a
countervailing
message.
and
if
you're
going
to
adopt--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
that.
it
seems
from
the
record
in
this
case
they
thought
that
only
something
that
screamed
"exculpatory
evidence"
on
its
face
needed
to
be
turned
over.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
i
think
at
a
minimum
it
has
two
pieces,
your
honor.
it
has
basic
instruction
about
how
to
go
about
fulfilling
the
brady
obligation,
and
how
do
you
go
about
looking
through
the
file
to
make
sure
you
know
what's
there,
making
sure
you
have
documents
that
are
in
the
possession
of
the
police.
thinking
in
advance,
as
this
court
talked
about
in
the
agurs
case,
about
what
the
evidence
is
going
to
be
at
trial
and
looking
thoughtfully
at
that
evidence
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
evidence
was
favorable
to
the
accused
and
needs
to
be
produced.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
well--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--i
think
the
second
thing
that
the
--
that
the
office
really
should
do
is
to
--
to
talk
about
the
importance
of
safeguarding
the
innocent
here,
that
our
job
is
not
just
to
secure
convictions.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
do
think
that
there
are
other
constitutional
requirements
involved.
most
of
the
hypotheticals,
however,
that
have
been
brought
before
the
court
as
a
parade
of
horribles
aren't
actions
by
the
district
attorney.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--in
this
case,
there
has
been
a
stipulation
by
the
district
attorney's
office
that
you
do.
and
i
think
if
you
think
about
the
evidence
in
this--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
but
here,
the
specific--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--if
you
have
physical
evidence
that,
if
tested,
can
establish
the
innocence
of
the
person
who
is
charged,
you
have
to
turn
it
over.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
no,
your
honor.
in
this
case
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
piece
of
evidence,
a
specific
piece,
several
specific
pieces
of
physical
evidence,
that
it
has
been
stipulated
the
prosecutors
knew
contained
the
blood
of
the
perpetrator.
it
--
the
rule
and
the
training
that
should
have
been
provided
in
this
instance,
particularly
since
the
da
argues
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
that
should
have
been
produced--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--your
honor,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
think
there
are
at
least
three
layers
to
the
training
that
were
missing
here.
one
was
the
clear
message
about
the
importance
of
brady
compliance.
the
second
was
the
basic
ground
rules
about
how
you
go
about
your
brady
obligation.
and
third,
if
you
have
evidence
that
can
conclusively
establish
to
a
scientific
certainty
the
innocence
of
the
person
being
charged,
you
have
to
turn
it
over
or
get
it
--
get
it
tested.
you
can't
just
put
it
in
your
hip
pocket
and
say,
i
know--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--the
--
the
only
information
--
there
was
a
discovery
response
that
was
filed
very
shortly
before
trial,
long
after
mr.
thompson
was
charged
with
the
crime,
where
in
response
to
one
of
the
questions,
the
response
was:
"inspection
to
be
permitted".
if
you
look
at
the
chronology--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--your
honor,
there
was
no
information
provided.
it
was
--
the
simple
response
was
that
the
request
was
for
all
scientific
evidence
and
it
simply
--
and
physical
evidence
from
the
scene
of
the
crime.
the
answer
was:
"inspection
to
be
permitted".
then
the
blood
evidence,
the
very
next
day,
after
the
response
was
provided,
was
removed
from
the
crime
lab
by
the
prosecutors,
never
to
be
found
again.
and
defense
counsel
testified
without
impeachment
at
trial
that
he
went
to
the
evidence
locker,
looked
in
the
evidence
locker,
found
certain
pieces
of
physical
evidence
consistent
with
the
discovery
response,
but
not
the
blood
evidence,
neither
the
blood
report
nor
the
physical
specimens
that
were
involved
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
your
honor,
i
think,
first
of
all,
the
issue
has
to
rise
to
a
constitutional
level
in
order
to
be
talking
about
this
for
section
1983
purposes.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
justice
kennedy--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--i
think
--
i
think
there
are
some
important
distinctions
here.
and
first
of
all,
when
you
are
talking
about
search
and
seizure,
when
you
are
talking
about
miranda,
when
you
are
talking
about
those
things,
the
actor
that
is
committing
the
constitutional
tort
there
is
not
the
district
attorney.
it's
the
police.
what
we're
talking
about
here,
the
constitutional
tort--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--but
the
second
important
distinction,
your
honor
--
and
i
do
believe
training
should
be
given
there.
but
i
think
there
is
a
fundamental
distinction
between
a
brady
violation,
which
happens
in
private
and
may
never
be
revealed,
and
if
revealed,
happens
long
after
trial
and
long
after
incarceration,
and
a
situation
where
a
prosecutor
makes
an
improper
comment
during
a
closing
jury,
which
is
made
in
public.
defense
counsel
has
the
opportunity
right
there
to
stand
up
and
say,
your
honor,
i
object,
and
the
court
has
the
ability
to
address
that
issue
then
and
there.
with
a
brady
violation,
you
don't
have
any
of
that.
it's
made
in
secret.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
they
do.
but
i
think
there's
--
there's
a
particular
issue.
there
is
particular
force
in
this
context
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
brady,
because
it's
made
in
private.
because
it
is
--
by
definition,
if
the
information
has
been
concealed,
it
has
not
been
revealed
prior
to
the
time
the
defendant
suffers
constitutional
harm.
he's
found
guilty,
he's
sentenced
to
death,
et
cetera.
the
brady
violation,
unlike
your
situation,
mr.
chief
justice,
doesn't
come
to
light,
perhaps
ever.
but
in
mr.
thompson's
case,
more
than
a
decade
after
he
was
convicted.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
your
honor,
i--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--i
agree
with
that
concern,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
in
this
case,
this
was
a
no-training
case.
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
mr.
thompson
was
--
there
was
zero
brady
training
in
the
office.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
i
think
that
would
have
been
dependent
on
what
its
content
was,
your
honor,
and
the
other
circumstances
of
the
office.
if
you
look
at
canton,
what
canton
does
is
it
asks
the
question:
is
there
an
obvious
need
for
training
based
on
the
circumstances
of
this
particular--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--your
honor,
what
happened
is
the
physical
evidence
very
conveniently
was
being
sent
to
the
crime
lab
when
it
was
removed.
and
so
we
don't
know
what
the
motivation
was
as
to
why
that
physical
evidence
was
removed
at
that
time.
what
we
know
is
for
many,
many
months--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--what
we
assert,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--it
was
certainly
not
--
it
was
intentionally
not
placed
back
in
into
evidence
after
it
came
back
from
the
crime
lab,
and
there
was
actual
testimony
from
the
grand
jury
that
was
handling
this
and
looking
into
this
situation
for
some
period
of
time
of
just
that.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
there
are--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--first
of
all
--
let
me
address
that
directly.
first
of
all,
the
causation
question
was
put
to
the
jury;
the
jury
instruction
very
clearly
said
in
order
for
there
to
be
liability
here
the
fault
must
be
in
the
training
program,
not
in
the
individual
prosecutor,
and
the
defense
argued
vehemently
that
there
was
a
lack
of
causation.
what's
interesting
here
is--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--your
honor,
the
concept
of
monitoring
or
supervision
was
actually
the
concept
that
defendants
injected
into
the
case.
and
so
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
concern
that
there's
an
expansion
from
training,
it's
been
error
that's
invited.
and
i
don't
believe
it's
error,
your
honor;
but
it's
not
something
that
--
that
was
put
into
the
case
by
the
defense
or
the
court.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
your
honor,
again,
the
clear
thrust
of
this
case
was
a
failure
to
train
case.
the
concept
of
monitoring
and
supervision
was
introduced
by
the
defense,
not
by
the
--
by
the
plaintiffs.
but
to
get
back
to
justice
kennedy's
case--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--number
one,
there
was
absolutely
no
brady
training
at
all.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
first
of
all,
i
think
a
broad
statement
in
training
about
the
importance
of
safeguarding
the
rights
of
the
accused--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--no,
it
isn't,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
the
--
the
second
aspect
of
--
of
it,
though,
is
what
i
said
to
justice
alito,
and
that
is
that
if
you
have
physical
evidence
which
if
tested
would
establish
either
the
guilt
or
the
innocence
of
the
--
of
the
defendant,
it
needs
to
be
produced.
or
at
least
tested.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
right.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
the
brady
violation
was
for
failure
to
produce,
you
are
right.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
your
honor,
certainly
what
the
crime
lab
report
said
was
that
the
blood
that
was
tested
of
the
perpetrator
was
type
b.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
we
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
that's
the
unresolved
factual
question.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
and
i
think
that's
where
causation
comes
in,
your
honor,
because
i
think
there
are
two
possibilities.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
yes.
it
turned
out
that
mr.
thompson
was
in
fact
type
o.
but
the
evidence--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--the
evidence
is
unclear
as
to
whether
or
not
the
assistants
knew
at
the
time
that
john
thompson
had
type
o
blood.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
if
in
fact
the
senior
prosecutors,
your
honor,
have
a
good
familiarity
with
the
constitutional
requirements--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--absolutely.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
i
think
--
i
think
the
failure
here,
and
i
think
we
have
to
come
back
to
the
deliberate
indifference
piece.
because
what
would
happen
there
in
that
instance,
your
honor,
even
if
the
training
was
not
provided,
i
think
as
experience
has
shown
under
canton,
that
claim
would
fail
for
failure
to
show
the
deliberate
indifference
of
the
policymaker.
but
here
you
had
substantial
evidence
about
mr.
connick's
indifference.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
your
honor,
that
certainly
has
been
the
position
taken
by
the
district
attorney's
office
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
it
--
it
is
consistent
with
brady
that
if
--
if
one
has
a
piece
of
evidence
that
can
conclusively
establish
that
the
defendant
is
innocent,
that
it
can't
be
the
law
that
the
prosecutor
can
just
put
it
in
his
hip
pocket,
not
get
it
tested,
and
not
turn
it
over
to
the
defense,
and
not
worry
about
whether
they're
prosecuting
an
innocent
man.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
no,
your
honor.
first
of
all
there
is
--
there
is
a
stipulation,
stipulation
l
at
ja
14,
prior
to
the
armed
robbery
trial,
mr.
thompson
and
his
attorneys
were
not
advised
of
the
existence
of
the
blood
evidence,
that
the
evidence
had
been
tested,
that
a
blood
type
was
determined
definitively--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--but
--
but
--
yes,
your
honor.
but
--
what
also
is
present
here
is
the
defense
never
had
the
chance
to
--
never
saw
the
physical
blood
evidence
itself.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
never
knew
it
existed,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
there
is
testimony
clear
--
testimony
to
that
effect.
if
you
look
at
mr.
williams'
testimony
in
this
case,
there
is
a
section
of
the
cross-examination
where
john
thompson's
defense
counsel
at
the
original
criminal
trial
said
just
that.
he
didn't
know
it
existed.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
but--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--yes,
justice
scalia,
but
here
there
is
a
stipulation
that
the
crime
lab
report
with
the
conclusive
evidence
about
the
perpetrator's
blood
type
was
never--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--and
the
physical
evidence
was
never
seen,
your
honor,
by
defense
counsel.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
your
honor,
four
prosecutors,
it
is
clear
that
four
prosecutors
knew
about
the
existence
of
blood
evidence
for
months,
and
it
was
never
produced
to
the
defense.
and
that
blood
evidence
would
have
conclusively
established
john
thompson's
innocence.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
but
--
but
your
honor,
the
"it"
was
not
come
over
and
see
the
blood
evidence.
it
was,
there
was
a
broad
request
for
--
for--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--physical
evidence
at
the
crime
scene,
including
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
blood.
so
there
is
nothing
that
the
defense
lawyer
would
have
known
by
going
to
the
evidence
room
to
say,
i
know
there
is
nothing
here.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
but
the
point
here,
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
goes
to
the
causation
point,
that
--
that
it
would
appear
--
it
would
appear
from
looking
at
mr.
williams'
testimony
that
there
was
a
deliberate
effort
to
stay
away
from
blood
evidence
in
the
carjacking
case.
and
mr.
williams
conceded
that.
so
this
idea
that
this
was
an
innocent
error
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutors
does
not
find
support
in
the
record.
the
question
is--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
a
tactical
choice
to
do
something
--
sharpe
--
on
the
one
hand,
and
a
knowing
brady
violation
on
the
other
hand.
and
the
jury
could
clearly
conclude
--
particularly
because
the
30(b)(6)
witness
in
this
office
testified
that,
in
his
view,
it
wasn't
brady
material
unless
the
prosecutors
knew
john
thompson's
blood
type,
the
jury
could
clearly
conclude
that
what
happened
here
was
these
four
prosecutors
didn't
understand
and
never
got
a
clear
message
about
--
about
what
brady
required,
and
they
did
not
produce
this
evidence.
there
is
nothing
that
clearly
showed
that
they
committed
knowing
brady
violations
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
canton
articulates
a
very
flexible
test.
and
i
don't
think
canton
says
there
is
one
size
that
fits
all.
and
i
think
the
protection
that
district
attorney's
offices
get
from
canton
is
from
the
standard
of
deliberate
indifference.
and
if
one
looks
at
the
21
years
of
experience
under
canton,
there
have
been
6
and
8
cases
against
prosecutors'
offices
under
this
kind
of
theory,
in
total,
where
there
was
some
payout
from
the
prosecutors'
offices
to
the
defense.
total
in
the
21
years.
so
--
and
the
court
said
--
this
court
said
in
canton,
judge
and
jury
doing
their
job
are
adequate
to
the
test.
i
think
we
have
been
spending
a
lot
of
time
focusing
on
how
much
training.
the
fact
is,
this
is
a
no-training
case,
where
evidence
that
the
defendants
now
concede
should
have
been
produced
wasn't
produced,
and
four
people
knew
about
it
and
failed
to
produce
it.
in
addition,
there
were
multiple
additional
pieces
of
brady
material
in
the
murder
case
that
weren't
produced.
and
this--
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
--i
think,
again,
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
office.
i
think
with
this
--
this
presumption
against
disclosure
that
was
present
in
connick's
office,
that
takes
this
case
out
of
the
realm
of
the
typical
prosecutor's
case,
because
it
is
a
bare
minimum
disclosure
rule.
i
think
there
needs
to
be
--
if
you
are
going
to
have
that
bare
minimum
disclosure
rule,
there
needs
to
be
something
to
counterbalance.
if
you
look
at
what
the
assistants
testified
to
in
this
case,
they
all
knew
what
not
to
produce.
what
they
didn't
know
was
what
to
produce.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
very
quick
answers
to
that.
if
one
looks
at
j.a.
550
to
551,
which
was
mr.
glas,
the
grand
jury
prosecutor's,
testimony.
what
he
clearly
said
was
during
the
grand
jury,
when
mr.
connick
decided
to
terminate
the
grand
jury,
mr.
connick
and
his
first
assistant
were
actually
arguing
with
glas
that
if
the
prosecutors
didn't
know
john
thompson's
blood
type,
they
didn't
need
to
turn
over
the
blood
report.
so
that
is
number
one.
i
think
there
is
an
issue
of
fact
that
has
to
be
resolved
in
our
favor
solely
from
j.a.
550
and
551.
and
the
second
is,
your
honor,
the
--
the
rule,
the
bare
minimum
discovery
rule.
louisiana
law
did
not
require
the
production
of
crime
lab
reports
in
1985.
mr.
j.
gordon
cooney
jr.
i
think
the
first
thing
you
do
is
you
have
a
hiring
process
that
emphasizes
the
important
of
--
the
importance
of
brady,
as
this
office
did.
brady
was
important.
one
witness
said
--
mcelroy
--
from
the
moment
you
walked
in
the
door,
you
had
to
write
an
essay
on
brady.
brady
was
emphasized
as
being
very
important.
