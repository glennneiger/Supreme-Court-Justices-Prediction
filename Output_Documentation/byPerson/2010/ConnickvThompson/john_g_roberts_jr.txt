chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-571,
connick
v.
thompson.
mr.
duncan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
what's
the
page
number.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
828.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
cooney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
justice
alito's
question
was
what
you
would
tell
the
assistant
d.a.'s.
what's
your
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
that's
your
instruction
on
--
on
brady.
now,
you
are
basing
liability
on
--
on
this
incident
of
failing
to
comply
with
brady.
so
you
say
they
should
have
instructed
on
brady.
what
else
should
they
have
instructed
on?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
the
--
you're
the
new
d.a.
and
you
are
putting
up
--
i
need
to
instruct
my
people.
what
--
what
do
they
instruct
on?
i
know
they
instruct
on
brady
under
your
view.
what
else?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
are
--
we
are
looking
at
specifics
where
they
are
going
to
violate
the
constitution.
i
think
that's
a
good
thing,
to
tell
them
they
have
an
obligation
as
well
to
protect
the
innocent.
but
we
are
worried
about
violations
of
our
constitutional
requirements.
we
know
brady
is
one.
what
is
the
next
one?
what
is
day
2
in
the
course?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
it
is
--
prosecutors
can
violate
a
defendant's
constitutional
rights
by
making
improper
statements
in
their
closing
arguments.
do
you
have
to
instruct
new
--
i
suspect
new
prosecutors
coming
out
of
law
school
don't
know
what
those
rules
are.
do
you
have
to
give
instruction
on
what
they
can
say
in
closing
arguments?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
understanding
is
--
i'm
not
an
expert
in
criminal
law.
i
need
training
in
that.
but
my
understanding
is
that
comments
in
a
closing
argument
can
give
rise
to
a
constitutional
violation.
so
you
should
--
you
should
train
those
people.
you
know
that.
you
know
that
that
can
happen,
just
as
you
know
there
can
be
brady
violations.
so
they
need
training
in
exactly
what
they
can
say
and
can't
say
in
closing
arguments.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
are
talking
about
improper
comments
in
closing
argument,
it
is
the
prosecuting
attorney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
don't
have
to
train
with
respect
to
closing
arguments?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
what
--
most
law
offices
with
which
i
am
familiar,
the
training
is
mentoring.
in
other
words,
the
young
attorneys
learn
from
the
older
attorneys,
often
by
following
them
along
--
around.
would
it
have
been
an
adequate
training
program
for
this
office
simply
to
say,
new
prosecutors,
you
don't
get
to
be
first
chair
prosecutors
until
after
a
year,
and
you
are
going
to
follow
one
of
the
prosecutors
around
and
learn
from
them?
is
that
an
adequate
training
program?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
--
even
if
the
violation
that
becomes
of
the
basis
for
the
claim
later
on
is
one
that,
you
know,
didn't
come
up
in
that
year?
we
--
they
didn't
have
a
brady
issue
in
that
first
year.
they
went
around;
they
sat
in,
in
a
lot
of
trials;
but
there
wasn't
a
brady
issue
and
so
they
didn't
learn
about
this
type
of
question.
and
--
does
that
give
rise
to
a
claim
of
the
sort
you
are
bringing
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
best
practice?
in
other
words,
i
thought
that
was
the
good
thing,
when
what
the
prosecutor
does
is
say,
look
at
everything
we've
got.
and
as
my
brother
has
suggested,
what
is
important
may
not
be
there
for
either
deliberate
misconduct
or
by
happenstance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
this
have
been
a
no-training
case
if
the
rule
was
you
have
to
be
in
the
office
for
3
years
as
a
second
chair
prosecutor
before
we
let
you
have
a
case,
and
in
fact,
you
have
to
be
here
10
years
before
we
let
you
have
a
capital
case?
that's
all
it
says.
is
that
sufficient
training?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
duncan,
have
you
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
train
your
new
hires?
first
day,
somebody
right
out
of
law
school
shows
up
and
says,
i
want
to
be
an
assistant
district
attorney.
how
do
you
train
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
