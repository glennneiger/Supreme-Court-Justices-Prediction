justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
that
so?
i've
read
the
instruction
that
the
court
gave
and
it
seems
to
me
the
instruction
the
court
gave
was
word-for-word
taken
from
canton.
and
when
i
read
the
question
that
you
presented
in
your
petitioner's
brief
--
in
the
petition
for
cert,
i
thought
what
this
case
was
about
was
an
instance
where
there
was
only
--
it
was
conceded
that
there
was
only
one
such
instance.
but
then
when
i
read
that
your
second
reiteration
of
the
question,
which
is
a
little
bit
different,
and
read
the
briefs,
i
thought
no,
there
are
four
other
ones.
so
what
you
are
really
asking
us
to
do
is
to
decide
in
the
case
of
perfect
instructions
whether
the
evidence
supports
them.
i
didn't
think
i
was
getting
into
that
and,
frankly,
the
brief
clearly
supports
it.
others
could
disagree.
but
why
are
we
getting
into
that
business
in
this
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
what
is
it
you
are
asking?
is
there
something
in
the
instruction
that
is
wrong?
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry.
where
--
i'm
reading
the
instruction,
i
have
it
here.
what
is
it?
i'm
not
saying
you
are
wrong.
i'm
just
saying,
what
in
the
words
stated
are
wrong
and
where
is
the
request
that
they
be
stated
differently,
that
i
should
look
at
that,
and
that
they
weren't.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
the
words
--
i
mean,
it
looked
to
me
like
the
words
on
page
828
are
pretty
similar
to
my
copy
of
what
he
actually
said.
so
what
are
the
words
on
page
828
that
you
think
he
should
have
said
that
he
didn't
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
he
says
here
is
"the
situation
involved
a
difficult
choice
or
one
that
the
prosecutors
had
a
history
of
mishandling,
such
that
additional
training,
supervision
or
monitoring
was
clearly
needed.
"
so
it
looks
to
me
like,
unless
i'm
reading
the
wrong
page,
which
i've
sometimes
done
out
of
my
memo
here.
it
looks
to
me
like
he
gave
those
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
saying
what
is
it
that
you
asked
the
judge
to
do
that
he
didn't
do
or
that
you
asked
him
not
to
do
that
he
did
do?
that's
what
happens.
that's
the
way
you
object
to
an
instruction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
what
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
you
to
point
out
in
the
record
the
words
that
were
said
to
the
district
court
saying
"judge,
i
want
you
to
say
this.
"
and
then
the
judge
didn't
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
think
we
take
it
as
you
saying
that
you
not
objecting
to
the
instruction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
your
whole
brief
is
objecting
to
the
instruction
and
you
didn't
include
the
objection?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait,
wait.
if
you
don't
object
to
the
instruction,
then
we're
back
to
what
i'm
saying,
that
what
you
are
objecting
to
is
you
don't
think
the
evidence
was
such
that,
given
that
instruction,
the
jury
could
find
guilt.
and
that's
what
i
thought
this
case
wasn't
about
to
begin
with,
and
there
are
three
other
instances.
so
i
don't
see
why,
given
this
instruction,
the
jury
couldn't
find
guilt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
look
--
he
read
the
instructions.
they
came
right
out
of
canton;
seems
perfect.
now
you're
saying,
well,
whether
they
did
or
not,
you
cannot
have
an
incident
--
you
can't
have
liability
if
there
is
only
one
incident.
and
at
that
point,
i
say,
gee,
i
don't
know;
i
mean,
maybe
it
depends
on
what
the
incident
is.
maybe
the
incident
involved
somebody
saying:
hey,
brady,
what's
brady?
or
somebody
saying:
what's
a
criminal
trial?
i
mean
that
person
needs
training.
and
--
or
--
but
i
don't
even
have
to
think
of
that
here,
because
there
were
four
incidents
here.
and
therefore,
i
don't
have
to
try
to
make
up
weird
hypotheticals.
so
where
we
have
four
instances
and
we
have
correct
instructions,
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
we
have
--
we
have
--
all
this
case?
i
thought
that
they
had
several
instances
in
other
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
involved
--
in
other
words,
there
has
never
in
this
office
been
an
instance
of
a
brady
violation
outside
of
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
after,
that's
what
it
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
there
were
four
brady
violations
involving
this
office,
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
now
we
are
talking
about
not
one;
we
are
talking
about
four--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--over
many
years,
with
tens
of
thousands
of
violations,
correct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
helpful.
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
--
am
i
right
--
am
i
right
on
this?
here
--
i
read
on
page
4
of
your
brief
that
it
seemed
what
happened
--
and
i
might
not
be
right,
correct
me
if
i'm
not.
what
happened
is
a
piece
of
paper
called
the
lab
report
came
to
the
--
one
of
the
prosecutors'
attention
two
days
before
the
trial,
and
what
it
said
was,
the
blood
that
was
the
perpetrator's
was
type
b.
and
the
person
on
trial
has
blood
of
type
o.
is
that
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
--
and
the
prosecutor
knew
that
the
person
on
trial
had
type
o?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
that's
something--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
it
turn
out
at
the
trial
that
eventually
the
prosecutor
knew
it
was
type
o?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
the
did
they
learn
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
have
to
overturn
what
the
jury
found?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
don't?
because
they
found
that
the
failure
to
adequately
train
amounted
to
deliberate
indifference
to
the
fact
that
inaction
would
result
in
a
constitutional
violation.
that's
what
they
found.
now,
how
can
we
--
assuming
that's
true,
and
accepting
it
and
not
overturning
it
--
find
that
there
was
something
unlawful?
because
you
are
arguing
--
you
are
all
arguing
about
whether
the
training
program
really
was
adequate
or
not.
they
found
it
was
not.
what
do
we
do?
