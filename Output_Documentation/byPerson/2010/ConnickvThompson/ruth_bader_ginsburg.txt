justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
there
something
in
between?
because
in
canton,
the
hypothetical
was
one
rookie
police
officer.
here,
it
wasn't
one
rogue
prosecutor.
there
were
four
prosecutors
who
knew
of
this
blood
evidence
and
there
were
multiple
opportunities
for
them
to
disclose
it,
but
four
of
them
apparently
thought
it
was
okay
under
brady
to
keep
this
quiet.
now,
if
we
were
just
talking
about
--
what
was
his
name,
deegan?
it
would
be
a
different
case.
but
we
have
the
three
other
prosecutors.
so
i
think
it's
questionable
to
characterize
this
as
a
single
incident.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
life
doesn't
always
come
in
just
two
categories,
and
my
suggestion
to
you
is
this
doesn't
fit
into
this
single
rookie.
you
have
--
if
you
have
four
prosecutors
who
are
not
turning
over
this
evidence,
then
it
seems
like
to
me
it's
kind
of
a
culture
in
the
office
that
we
don't
turn
over
--
either
we
don't
understand
brady,
because
one
suggestion
was
--
well,
having
the
blood
sample
will
show
you
--
you
would
have
to
have
the
blood
sample
from
thompson
to
have
it
mean
anything.
so
there
was
misunderstanding
about
that.
but
what
struck
me
was
that
to
shoehorn
this
into
a
single
incident,
it
doesn't
fit.
so
we
have
a
situation
maybe
that
hasn't
--
that
we
haven't
directly
confronted
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
tell
me
--
i
think
i
have
a
copy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
so?
i
mean,
you
are
assume
that
everyone
who
goes
to
law
school
takes
a
course
in
criminal
procedure,
and
i
think
there
are
many
law
schools
where
they
don't
even
have
such
a
course
and
others
where
most
--
i
don't
know
anywhere
it's
compulsory
to
take
a
course
in
criminal
procedure.
so
you're
assuming
that.
and
of
course,
the
time
is
running.
there
is
something
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
brady
which
seems
to
me
unlike
others
and
why
you
would
want
special
vigilance.
and
that
is,
miranda
warnings,
you
know
what
was
said;
search
and
seizure
you
know
what
the
police
did.
but
the
problem
with
brady
--
and
this
case
illustrates
it
so
well
--
is
you
don't
know.
if
the
prosecutors
don't
do
what
they're
supposed
to
do,
there
is
a
very
high
risk,
as
there
was
in
this
case,
that
it
will
never
come
to
light.
so,
recognizing
the
legal
obligation
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
temptation
not
to
come
out
with
brady
evidence
because
it
doesn't
help
the
state's
case,
shouldn't
there
be
extra
vigilance
when
we
are
talking
about
a
brady
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
object
to
it?
to
the
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
the
"or",
difficult
choice,
"or"
one
that
prosecutors
had
a
history
of
mishandling?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it's
something
like
i
was
trying
to
get
at
before
when
i
said
miranda
was
out
there,
you
know
what
was
said,
you
know
what
was
seized.
talking
about
--
but
brady,
if
the
prosecutor
doesn't
come
out
with
it,
high
risk
that
it
will
never
come
out.
so
we
have
use
of
force,
plus
that
--
which
could
kill
people
if
you
were
not
properly
trained.
brady,
because
if
they
don't
come
up
with
the
information,
it
could
have
what
almost
happened
in
this
case.
anything
else
on
this
special
list?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
concern
was
that
you
don't
want
to
have
to
give
the
prosecutors
a
clinical
law
school
course
before
you
let
them
do
their
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
dubelier
testimony?
didn't
he
testify
that
it
was
standard
operating
procedure
to
turn
over
all
lab
reports?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
thomas
just
reported
on
dissent
from
today's
decision.
nearly
half
a
century
ago
in
brady
against
maryland,
this
court
held
that
due
process
requires
the
prosecution
to
turn
over
evidence
favorable
to
the
accused
and
material
to
his
guilt
or
punishment.
that
obligation
was
dishonored
in
this
case.
consequently,
john
thompson
spent
14
years
isolated
on
death
row,
before
the
truth
came
to
light.
he
was
innocent
of
the
charge
of
attempted
robbery
and
his
subsequent
murder
trial,
by
prosecutorial
design,
was
fundamentally
unfair.
within
weeks
of
thompson's
scheduled
execution,
a
private
investigator
hired
by
defense
counsel
unearthed
a
police
crime
lab
report.
prior
to
thompson's
armed
robbery
trial,
the
crime
lab
had
tested
a
swatch
of
fabric
stained
with
the
robber's
blood.
the
lab
reported
to
the
prosecutors
that
the
perpetrator's
blood
type
was
b.
thompson's
blood
type
is
o.
petitioners
acknowledged
that
thompson's
prosecutors
violated
his
right
to
due
process
by
withholding
from
defense
counsel
the
blood
stains
swatch
and
the
lab
report.
after
his
exoneration,
thomson
filed
a
civil
rights
action
seeking
to
hold
the
orleans
parish
district
attorney's
office
liable
for
failure
to
train
prosecutors
concerning
their
brady
obligations.
such
liability
attaches,
i
agree
with
the
court,
only
when
the
failure
to
train
amounts
to
deliberate
indifference
to
the
rights
of
persons
with
whom
untrained
employees
come
into
contact.
unlike
the
court,
however,
i
would
hold
that
the
record
in
this
case
abundantly
shows
labels
of
difference
to
thompson's
rights.
as
we
counted
in
detail
in
the
written
dissent,
the
conceded,
long-concealed
prosecutorial
transgressions
in
thompson's
trials
were
neither
isolated
nor
atypical.
they
were
just
what
one
would
expect
given
the
attitude
toward
brady
pervasive
in
the
district
attorney's
office,
just
one
of
many
examples.
the
prosecution
in
thompson's
murder
trial
failed
to
produce
a
police
report
containing
an
eyewitness
description
of
the
murderer
as
six
feet
with
close
cut
hair.
thompson
is
five
feet
eight
inches
tall.
and
at
the
time
of
the
murder,
he
styled
his
hair
in
a
large
afro.
no
fewer
than
five
prosecutors
concealed
year
upon
year
this
and
other
evidence
vital
to
thompson's
defense.
and
his
retrial
on
the
murder
charge,
which
yielded
a
prompt
not
guilty
verdict,
the
defense
introduced
10
exhibits
containing
evidence
not
disclosed
when
thompson
was
first
tried.
one
instruction
that
orleans
parish
prosecutors
received
regarding
their
obligation
to
reveal
evidence
favorable
to
the
accused,
district
attorney
connick
hired
staff
members
right
out
of
law
school.
and
because
of
high
turnover,
inexperienced
prosecutors
quickly
became
supervisors.
the
supervisors
leading
thompson's
prosecutions
learn
their
craft
in
orleans
parish.
they
recalled
no
instruction
at
the
district
attorney's
office
on
brady
and
its
application.
ample
evidence
presented
at
the
civil
rights
trial
demonstrated
that
connick
deliberate
--
deliberately
indifferent
attitude
created
a
tinderbox
in
which
brady
violations
were
not
inevitable.
and
when
they
did
occur,
connick
maintain
that
there
was
no
need
to
change
anything,
he
terminated
grand
jury
investigation
into
prosecutorial
misconduct
in
thompson's
case
because
holding
the
prosecutors
accountable
he
felt
that
make
his
job
more
difficult.
the
court
suggests
that
lawyers,
unlike
rookie
police
officers,
are
guided
by
their
professional
education
and
ethical
rules
and
therefore
need
no
special
brady
training.
as
a
handling
of
thompson's
prosecution
shows,
however,
brady
compliance
is
too
much
at
risk
and
too
fundamental
to
the
fairness
of
our
criminal
justice
system
to
be
taken
for
granted.
training
remains
critical
and
connick
himself
should
have
been
the
principle
insurer
of
that
training.
i
do
not
suggest
that
con
--
that
connick
can
be
held
vicariously
liable
to
thompson's
ordeal.
my
point
is
that
connick
bares
responsibility
for
his
own
deliberate
indifference
to
and
all
too
apparent
need
for
on-the-job
brady
training.
in
accord
with
the
court
of
appeals,
and
before
it,
the
district
court,
i
would
uphold
the
jury's
verdict
awarding
damages
to
thompson
for
the
gross,
deliberately
indifferent
and
long-continued
violation
of
his
fair
trial
right.
justice
breyer,
justice
sotomayor
and
justice
kagan
joined
me
in
this
dissenting
opinion.
