mr.
duncan,
could
i
give
you
a
hypothetical--
justice
elena
kagan
--just
to
test
how
strong
your
position
is
here.
so
let's
say
that
there
is
a
new
d.a.
comes
to
town
and
he
says,
there's
going
to
be
one
attorney
per
case
from
now
on
and
it
will
be
a
random
assignment
system.
so
sometimes
important
cases
will
be
tried
by
experienced
attorneys,
but
sometimes
they'll
be
tried
by
people
right
out
of
law
school.
and
there
will
be
no
brady
supervision
at
all,
no
brady
training.
and
there
is
a
closed
file
system,
that
we
only
turn
over
what
we
are
required
to
turn
over
and
not
anything
else.
and
in
addition
to
that,
if
i,
the
d.a.,
find
that
you
have
turned
over
things
that
you
are
not
required
to
turn
over,
that
will
be
taken
into
account
in
your
yearly
review
for
promotion
purposes,
for
salary
purposes,
et
cetera.
that
will
be
very
severely
frowned
upon.
so
the
new
d.a.--
justice
elena
kagan
--if
you
turn
over
anything
that
you
didn't
have
to.
okay?
justice
elena
kagan
if
you
give
any
material
that
you
are
not
required
to
do
by
law.
and
so
he
puts
into
place
this
whole
system
and
says,
okay,
go
to
it.
and
what
happens
is
that
there
are
brady
violations.
and
there
is
a
brady
violation
in
a
capital
case
and
the
person
sits
on
death
row,
or
the
person
is
executed,
whichever,
and
there
is
a
claim
brought.
is
that
claim
not
a
good
claim?
justice
elena
kagan
there
is
not
a
pattern,
because
he
just
came
to
town
and
he
just,
you
know,
instituted
all
these
policies,
and
this
is
the
first
brady
violation.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
failure
to
train
or
supervise
in
any
way
and
setting
up
a
structural
system
that's
pretty
much
guaranteed
to
produce
brady
violations,
that
would
not
be
enough?
in
other
words,
even
if
the
jury
said
yes,
you
are
liable
under
that
second
theory
--
not
the
policy
theory,
but
the
failure
to
train
and
supervise
theory
--
that
would
have
to
be
rejected?
justice
elena
kagan
could
i
add
to
my
hypothetical,
then?
justice
elena
kagan
suppose
that
this
new
district
attorney
said
--
every
day
he
came
into
the
office
and
he
said:
i
think
brady
is
just
crazy,
and
i
think
it's
just
the
worst
decision
that
the
supreme
court
has
ever
issued;
and
as
long
as
you
don't
get
caught,
anything
you
do
is
okay
by
me.
justice
elena
kagan
it's
not
a
policy.
he's
just,
you
know,
making
his
views
known
around
the
office.
justice
elena
kagan
then
the
policy
is
just
that
you
have
to
turn
over
what
you
have
to
turn
over,
nothing
else,
and
if
you
turn
over
anything
else
you
will
get
penalized
for
doing
so?
that's
the
policy?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
don't
they
make
it
available?
justice
elena
kagan
so
what
would
have
been
enough?
i
mean,
is
an
hour
a
year
enough?
is
an
hour
a
month
enough?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
cooney,
i'm
still
confused
as
to
sort
of
how
much
is
enough
by
way
of
training
and
how
you
would
ask
a
court
or
a
jury
to
decide
that.
you
suggested
to
the
chief
justice
formal
training
wasn't
--
isn't
necessary
if
there
is
some
supervision,
if
there
is
some
mentoring.
but,
you
know,
this
seems
to
give
cities
no
sense
of
what
they
have
to
do.
no
safe
harbors.
is
that
your
position?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
duncan,
that
i
think
you
can't
say,
because
that's
just
overturning
what
the
jury
found.
justice
elena
kagan
the
jury
found
that
there
was
inadequate
training.
justice
elena
kagan
in
fact,
the
jury
found
--
i
think,
if
you
look
at
the
record
--
the
jury
could
have
found,
a
reasonable
jury
could
have
found,
that
there
was
no
training
here.
