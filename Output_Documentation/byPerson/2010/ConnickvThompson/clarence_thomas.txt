justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
respondent
john
thompson
was
convicted
of
attempted
armed
robbery
in
1985.
because
of
that
conviction,
thompson
chose
not
to
testify
in
his
own
defense
in
his
later
trial
for
murder.
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death.
while
thompson
was
in
prison,
his
investigator
discovered
a
crime
report
from
his
robbery
case.
the
district
attorney's
office
agreed
with
thompson
that
according
to
brady
versus
maryland,
the
prosecutors
should
have
disclosed
the
lab
report
to
thompson
during
his
trial.
because
thompson's
blood
type
did
not
match
that
in
the
crime
lab
report,
his
robbery
conviction
was
reversed.
thompson's
murder
conviction
was
also
reversed
on
the
ground
that
the
armed
robbery
conviction
had
unconstitutionally
deprived
him
of
the
right
to
testify
in
his
own
defense
at
his
murder
trial.
in
2003,
thompson
was
retried
for
the
murder
and
found
not
guilty.
thompson
then
sued
the
district
attorney's
office
for
damages
under
42
u.s.c.
1983.
he
alleged
that
the
district
attorney
fails
to
train
the
prosecutors
adequately
about
their
constitutional
duty
under
brady
to
produce
exculpatory
evidence.
and
that
this
lack
of
training
had
caused
the
prosecutor's
failure
to
disclose
a
lab
report
in
his
case.
the
jury
awarded
thompson
$14
million
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
en
banc
court.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
under
our
precedence
of
plaintiff
seeking
to
hold
the
government
liable
for
failure
to
train
must
show
deliberate
indifference.
deliberate
indifference
requires
proof
that
policy
makers
disregarded
the
known
or
obvious
fact
that
a
particular
omission
in
their
training
program
would
cause
employees
to
violate
citizens'
constitutional
rights.
ordinarily,
a
pattern
of
constitutional
violations
by
untrained
employees
is
necessary
to
show
deliberate
indifference.
thompson
does
not
argue
that
any
pattern
of
previous
similar
brady
violation
exists
in
this
case.
in
canton
versus
harris,
this
court
left
open
the
possibility
that
failure
to
train
liability
could
be
based
on
a
single
incident
when
the
need
for
training
was
patently
obvious
such
as
when
a
city
does
not
tell
police
officers
about
the
constitutional
limits
on
the
use
of
deadly
force.
today,
we
conclude
that
canton's
hypothetical
exception
does
not
apply
to
claims
about
failure
to
train
prosecutors.
constitutional
violations
are
not
necessarily
the
consequence
of
a
failure
to
train
prosecutors.
attorneys
are
trained
in
the
law
and
equipped
to
interpret
and
apply
legal
principles
and
exercise
legal
judgment.
prosecutors,
in
particular,
are
ethically
required
to
know
and
follow
brady.
in
the
absence
of
a
pattern
of
previous
brady
violations
that
would
demonstrate
that
further
specific
training
is
necessary,
a
district
attorney
is
not
deliberately
indifferent
when
he
relies
on
prosecutor's
professional
training
and
ethical
obligations.
a
district
attorney's
office
therefore
may
not
be
held
liable
under
section
1983
for
failure
to
train
based
on
a
single
brady
violation.
