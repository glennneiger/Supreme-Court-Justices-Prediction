mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
asks
when
a
district
attorney's
office
may
be
liable
under
section
1983
for
inadequately
training
prosecutors.
the
petitioner,
orleans
parish
district
attorney's
office,
was
found
liable
for
the
terrible
injuries
caused
to
mr.
thompson
by
a
brady
violation
on
the
theory
the
office
was
deliberately
indifferent
to
brady
training,
this
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
proved
no
pattern
of
previous
misconduct
by
office
prosecutors.
the
district
court
exempted
this
case
from
the
ordinary
pattern
requirement
by
making
a
flawed
analogy
to
a
hypothetical
in
this
court's
city
of
canton
opinion.
there,
the
court
suggested
that
a
city
may
be
liable,
absent
a
pattern,
if
it
fails
to
inform
police
officers
of
the
basic
constitutional
standard
for
deadly
force.
extending
that
hypothetical
to
this
case
was
error.
it
misunderstood
canton's
distinction
between
a
single
incident
and
pattern
liability,
nullifying
canton's
stringent
standards
of
fault
and
causation.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
i
understand
your
question,
justice
ginsburg.
our
argument
does
not
turn
on
whether
it
was
one
or
three
or
four
prosecutors.
what
our
argument
does
turn
on
is
that
the
theory
from
the
canton
hypothetical,
which
does
not
require
a
pattern,
was
clearly
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
district
court
analogized
to
canton
in
order
to
allow
the
jury
to
find
liability
absent
a
pattern.
there
is
no
question
that,
whether
it
was
one
or
four
prosecutors,
this
is
a
single
incident
of
a
brady
violation.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
that's
true,
justice
sotomayor.
yes.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
correct.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
the
question
is
under
the
brady
scenario,
which
side
of
the
canton
line
does
it
fall
on?
does
it
fall
on
the
single
incident
line
or
the
pattern
line?
we
say
it
falls
on
the
pattern
line.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
well,
i
think
the
court
has
in
canton,
your
honor.
let
me
answer
it
this
way:
if
we
pay
close
attention
to
the
function
of
the
single
incident
hypothetical
in
canton,
i
think
it
illuminates
the
kind
of
notice,
the
kind
of
fault,
and
the
kind
of
causation
that
needs
to
arise
out
of
a
general
situation.
so
looking
carefully,
what
canton
said
is:
a
policymaker
who
fails
to
give
police
officers
the
basic
constitutional
standard
for
deadly
force,
which
they
are
not
equipped
to
know
in
the
beginning,
and
without
which--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
yes.
this
is
--
this
is
--
i
am
referring
to
the
--
the
basic
canton
standard
is
at
390,
page
390
of
the
canton
opinion.
and
specifically,
the
footnote
is
footnote
10,
that
discusses
the
two
possibilities,
the
no-pattern
and
the
pattern
possibilities.
so
i'm
reading
from
canton
at
footnote
10.
city
policymakers
know
--
"for
example",
the
court
said,
"city
policymakers
know
to
a
moral
certainty
that
their
police
officers
will
be
required
to
arrest
fleeing
felons.
"
"the
city
has
armed
its
officers
with
firearms,
in
part
to
allow
them
to
accomplish
this
task.
"
"thus,
the
need
to
train
officers
in
the
constitutional
limitations
on
the
use
of
deadly
force
can
be
said
to
be
so
obvious
that
the
failure
to
do
so
is
deliberate
indifference.
"
now,
what
we
have
there,
as
justice
o'connor's
concurrence
in
that
case
and
then
later
the
court's
opinion
in
bryan
county
explains,
you
have
a
failure
to
inform
city
personnel
of
the
basic
standard
without
which
they
have
no
hope
of
doing
their
job
in
a
constitutional
manner.
so
you
put
your
employees
in
a
situation
of
impossibility
and
when
a
deadly
force
violation
occurs,
what
you
have--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--that's
correct.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
they've
got
no
background
equipment
to
know
what
the
constitutional
standard
is.
and
so
that
satisfies,
in
a
general
situation--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--it
could
be,
your
honor.
here,
you're
giving--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--it
could
be.
however,
what
you
are
giving
to
lawyers
here
is
the
task
of
analyzing
legal
judgment.
can
lawyers'
judgments
go
astray,
justice
sotomayor?
absolutely.
but--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--well--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--that
is
not
the
canton
example,
your
honor.
what
we
have
here--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--no,
that's
not
what
we
are
saying.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
policymaker
inevitably
knows,
my
prosecutors
are
going
to
make
this
mistake,
and
so
i
need
to
train
on
it;
i
don't
care
about
training
on
it.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
yes,
sir.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
no,
your
honor.
what
we
concede
in
this
case
is--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--i'm
not
aware
that
it
would
always
be
a
violation
of
brady.
however,
of
course,
we
have
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
--
uncontradicted
evidence,
that
the
office
policy
was
to
turn
over
all
scientific
reports.
but--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--sure.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
i'm
sorry?
repeat
the
last
part
again,
the
"severely
frowned
upon"
part?
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
i
understand.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
if
there
is
a
pattern
of
demonstrated--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--not
for
the
first
brady
violation,
justice
kagan.
but
in
your
hypothetical,
you
noted
a
policy
of
actually
assigning
inexperienced
prosecutors
randomly
to
perhaps
high-profile
cases.
if
that
were
the
facts
the
jury,
as
they
could
have
in
this
case,
could
have
found
that
an
official
policy
actually
caused
the
violation.
but
they
didn't
find
it
in
this
case.
so
the
hypo
leaves
open
that
possibility.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
no
--
exactly,
your
honor.
no
liability
there,
because
it
doesn't
meet
the
stringent
fault
and
causation
standards
of
canton.
this
goes
back
to--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--we
are
not
asking
you
to.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
yes,
the
instructions
reflect
that
the
single
incident
theory--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--yes,
justice
breyer.
let
me
help
you
with
that.
the
--
the,
at
the
joint
appendix
page
828
we
have
the
instructions
on
deliberate
indifference.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
828.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
joint
appendix
828.
there
are
the
instructions
on
deliberate
indifference.
let
me
start
here,
justice
breyer.
these
instructions
are
taken
from
the
second
circuit's
walker
decision,
which
was
the
first
court
that
i
am
aware
of
to
allow
for
the
possibility
of
single
incident
liability
in
a
brady
situation.
the
second
instruction
there
allows
a
choice.
it
allows
a
choice
for
the
jury
to
find
that
a
single
incident
situation
--
i'm
sorry,
that
a
situation
involving
a
brady
decision
could
arise
and
be
a
basis--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
"the
situation
involved
a
difficult
choice
or
one
that
prosecutor
s
had
a
history
of
mishandling.
"
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
that
is
the
--
i'm
sorry.
then
i
misunderstood
your
question.
that's
not
the
actual
instruction.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
i
misunderstood.
i
was
reading
where
i
thought
the
single
incident
theory
was
posed
in
the
jury
instructions.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
the
petitioner
specifically
asked
that
an
instruction
be
given
that
required
a
pattern
of
similar--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--it
is
instruction
number
14.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
the
proposed
instruction.
i
regret
to
say
i
don't
believe
that
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
and
it
is
also--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
no,
your
honor.
the
argument
is
not
about
the
specific
jury
instruction.
it's
about
the
legal
theory.
what
it's
about--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--what
our
main
complaint
is,
is
about
the
failure
of
the
district
court
to
grant
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
basis
that
a
failure-to-train
theory
under
these
circumstances
does
not
permit
the
single
--
the
single--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--that's
correct.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
correct.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
that's
--
under
the
canton
hypothetical,
yes,
it
would
have
to
fall
on
the
pattern
side
because
the
general
brady
situation
is
unlike
the
single-incident--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
that
sounds
like
a
policy
to
me,
your
honor.
that
sounds
like
a
policy,
an
actionable
policy
on
the
part
of
the
policymaker.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
well,
this
court
has
defined
"policy"
as
a
deliberate
choice
to
embark
on
a
course
of
action
in
pembaur,
which
this
court
accepted.
that
sounds
like
a
policy
to
me.
if
it's
not
a
policy--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--well,
then
the
policy
is
constitutional.
so
what
we
would
look
to
is
are
prosecutors
failing
to
exercise
their
judgment
properly
pursuant
to
that
policy?
and
that
falls
very
squarely
within
the
second
part
of
the
canton
choices,
which
requires
a
pattern.
this
case
is
about
the
alleged
failure
to
remedy,
to
guide,
to
reinforce,
the
preexisting
legal
judgment
that
a
prosecutor
has
by
virtue
of
being
a
legal
professional.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
well,
of
course
there
should
be
vigilance.
but
the
question
you
pose,
justice
ginsburg,
is
whether
the
latency,
the
hiddenness,
that
characterizes
brady
violations
should
change
where
we
locate
the
canton
violation.
should
it
be
enough
to
put
it
into
the
single
incident,
so-obvious
category,
or
still
in
the
pattern
category?
but
canton
doesn't
indicate
that
the
latency
of
a
particular
violation
should
--
should
turn
on
which
category
it
goes
into.
instead,
it's
the
nature
of
the
employee
duties
and
the
employees
themselves
and
how
that
situation
gives
notice
to
a
policymaker
about
when
there
are
obvious
training
risks.
that's
what
we
are
talking
about.
so
to
go
back
to
the
hypothetical,
in
canton
whether
or
not
a
deadly
force
situation
is
secret
or
not
--
of
course
it's
not.
but
the
office
has
failed
not
just
to
train,
but
to
inform
of
the
basic
constitutional
duty,
without
which
those
officers
have
no
chance
of
fulfilling
their
duties.
and
when
they
do
a
deadly
force
violation
under
those
circumstances,
the
causal
link
will
be
very
strong.
it
will
be
strong
enough
to
meet
canton.
and
so
there
you
have
--
there
you
have
a
situation
where
deliberate
indifference
and
causation
are
met
without
the
pattern.
but
what
--
you
do
not
have
that
in
the
situation
of
brady
compliance
because,
as
--
as
everyone
agrees
brady
involves
gray
areas.
it
is
impossible
to
determine
beforehand
exactly
why
a
brady
violation
will
occur,
and
what
specific
training
measures
would
prevent
it
from
occurring.
and
what
that
means
is,
this
falls
plainly
within
what
canton
said
about
the
pattern
situation.
here's
what
canton
said
in
the
footnote
10
following
onto
the
hypothetical.
"it
could
also
be
that
the
police
in
exercising
their
discretion
so
often
violate
constitutional
rights
that
the
need
for
further
training
must
have
been
plainly
obvious.
"
that's
the
situation
we
have
posed
by
the
brady
situation
in
general.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
your
honor,
there
weren't
four
instances.
there
was
one
brady
violation
that
possibly
could
have
involved
one
to
four
prosecutors.
that's
one--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
no,
your
honor.
that's
not
true.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
there
were
some
--
there
were
four
reported
brady
violations
before
this
case,
in
the
decade
leading,
up,
involving
this
office,
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
circumstances
involved
here.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
correct,
out
of
tens
of
thousands
of
prosecutions.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
we're
--
but
we're--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--what
was
--
the
fifth
circuit
panel
in
this
case
affirmatively
said
thompson
did
not
even
try
to
prove
a
pattern
and
did
not
prove
a
pattern
of
violations.
the
fifth
circuit
panel
said
that.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
yes,
sir.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
that's
closer
to
what
it
should
be,
justice
kennedy,
yes,
because
that
begins
to
capture
the
pattern
requirement.
it's
not
--
it's
not
the
pattern
instruction
that
was
specifically
put
forth
by
the
petitioners
in
instruction
number
15.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
not
by
petitioners
--
not
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
there's
no
--
there's
no
--
the
question--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--the
--
the
charge?
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
no,
the
petitioners
did
not
object
to
the
--
the
specific
formulation
of
that
charge.
immediately
after
that
charge,
though,
they
--
they
said,
no,
but
we
--
we
have
to
have
a
pattern
instruction
here.
in
other
words--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--it
was
rejected.
it
was
rejected
twice,
your
honor,
first
in
the
formal
jury
instructions
and
then
at
the
charge
colloquy.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
what
we
present
is
the
legal
theory
on
which
this
case
was
submitted,
what
got
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place,
should
never
have
got
to
that
legal
theory
at
all.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
with
respect
to
the
brady
situation.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
what
--
what
the
canton
single
incident
hypo
is
talking
about
is
failing
to
provide
--
uh
--
employees
with
basic
tools,
without
which
they
absolutely
have
no
chance
of
fulfilling
their
constitutional
obligations.
if
we
--
it's
difficult
to
imagine
that
situation
for
prosecutors.
it
is
--
it's
conceivable
that
the
district
attorney's
office
set
up
--
sets
up
a
structure
where
prosecutors
have
no
chance
of
even
knowing
whether
there
is
brady
evidence
in
the
file.
if
you
have
that
situation,
then
it's
closer
to
the
canton
single
incident
hypothetical,
but
not
involving
the
exercise
of
legal
judgment
in
particular
cases.
we
say
no.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
that's
exactly
--
that's
my
point.
that's
my
point.
if
you
don't
--
if
you
don't
even
--
in
other
words,
if
you
don't
even
have
a
police
file,
for
instance,
you
can't
exercise
your
legal
judgment
if
you
don't
even
know
what
--
what
the
subject
of
your
legal
--
the
object
of
your
legal
judgment
is.
but
that's
not
this
case.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
failure
to
remedy,
reinforce,
refine
existing
legal
judgment
that
prosecutors
have.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
justice
alito
and
justice
kagan,
you
asked
repeatedly
questions
designed
to
elicit
the
response
from
my
colleague:
what
would
you
tell
ada
with
respect
to
training
--
and
i
believe
justice
sotomayor
as
well
--
that
would
have
prevented
such
a
thing?
and
i
didn't
hear
a
clear
answer.
the
legal
issue
in
this
case
turns
on
the
fact
that
in
the
deadly
force
scenario
that
canton
marks
out
as
the
paradigm
single
incident
case,
it
is
very
clear
what
a
police
office
needs
to
tell
a
police
officer.
here's
the
deadly
force
standard
under
tennessee
v.
garner:
don't
shoot
people
unless
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
of
physical
danger
to
yourself
or
to
others.
you've
got
to
tell
them
that.
with
respect
to
the
brady
scenario,
it's
not
clear
at
all.
yes,
of
course,
training
is
useful.
yes,
of
course,
training
is
important.
but
how
do
you
connect
up
a
lack
of
specific
training
with
a
particular
violation
that
occurs?
and
having
heard
the
argument,
i'm
--
i'm
no
longer
clear
as
to
what
the
theory
of
the
case
of
my
colleague's
is
about
what
caused
the
violation.
whatever
caused
the
violation,
i
haven't
heard
about
a
specific
training
measure
that
would
have
actually
prevented
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
i
--
i
don't
think
--
the
jury
couldn't
have
found
that
that
didn't
occur,
your
honor.
the
jury
found
that
that
was
inadequate.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
a
reasonable
jury
could
have
found
--
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
contest
the
finding
of
inadequate
training.
what
we
contest
is
the
ingredients
that
could
lead
to
a
deliberate
indifference
finding
on
the
basis
of
inadequate
training.
and
what
we
say
is
that
this
case,
that
is
a
general
case
about
you
failed
to
train
on
brady,
it
doesn't
fit
within
the
single
incident
hypothetical.
and
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
with
--
in
response
to
your
questions
and
justice
alito's
questions
was
that,
if
you
can't
say
with
any
specificity,
well,
what
training
do
you
give?
you
asked
repeatedly,
your
honor,
how
much
training
is
enough?
so
is
an
hour
a
year?
i
thought
i
heard
my
colleagues
say
that
an
hour
a
year
may
make
this
not
a
no-training
case,
and
so
what
you
have
there
is
a
pattern
of--
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
--no,
your
honor.
absolutely
not.
mr.
s.
kyle
duncan
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
correct
resolution
is
the
lower
courts
should
dismiss
the
failure
to
train
claim
as
a
matter
of
law
because
there
was
no
demonstration
of
the
pattern
of
violations
and
this
situation
does
not
fall
within
the
narrow
range
of
circumstances
that
canton
foresees
for
single
incident
liability.
