these
are
people
who
haven't
gone
to
law
school,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
do
not
know
that
you
cannot
apply
deadly
force
in
most
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
were
giving
guns
to
lawyers,
it
might
have
been
different.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
depending
on
the
law
school
they
went
to
or
what?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
he
asked
that.
so
i
was
glad
to
see
that.
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
--
not
before
this
case.
there
was
some--
justice
antonin
scalia
--later,
as
far
as
we
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
--
for
brady
violations.
they
limit
the
principle
to
brady
violations.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
significant
limitation,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
you
start
with
that
rule?
the
rule
is
perfectly
lawful;
my
goodness.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
as
i
understand
it,
you
really
have
a
need
to
train
them
in,
when
you
know
defense
counsel
is
coming
over
to
look
at
the
physical
evidence,
don't
remove
from
the
locker
some
of
the
physical
evidence?
you
want
to
give
a
course
in
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
you
shouldn't
have
mentioned
it.
i
thought
you
were
asserting
that
it
was
intentionally
removed
in
order
to
prevent
defense
counsel
from
seeing
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
clear
from
what
--
according
to
what
you
said
earlier
it
isn't
clear
that
it
was
intentionally
withheld
from
the
defense.
it
might
have
just
been
--
you
said
it
was
sent
to
the
lab
when
--
when
he
came
to
look
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
would
training
have
--
have
gone
into
that
detail?
"don't
send
something
to
the
lab
when
defense
counsel
is
coming
over
to
look
for
it.
"
i
mean,
you
know,
that
--
that's
pretty
detailed.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
--
but
that
--
that's
the
lab
report.
that
--
that's
what
justice--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
all
we
know,
by
accident,
right?
and
the
training
would
--
would
probably
not
have
remedied
that
--
that
difficulty.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
defense
was
told
to
come
over
and
look
for
it
--
to
look
at
it.
and
when
he
came
over
to
look
at
it
--
for
all
we
know,
by
accident
--
it
was
--
it
had
been
sent
to
the
lab.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
understand,
but
--
yes.
okay.
