justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
this
is
a
single
incident,
and
canton
said
if
you
know
that
a
tort
is
likely
to
happen
without
training
then
one
incident
is
enough.
every
prosecutor
knows
that
there
can
be
brady
violations
if
people
are
not
taught
what
brady
means,
because
it's
not
self-evident
in
every
situation.
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
if
you
know
that
rookie
prosecutors
--
and
most
prosecutors'
offices
are
filled
with
young
ada's
who
have
just
come
out
of
law
school.
if
you
know
that
they
are
going
to
meet
some
situations
where
the
answer
is
not
intuitively
known,
like
that
if
you
get
a
lab
report,
you
should
turn
it
over,
don't
you
have
an
obligation,
isn't
that
what
the
jury
said,
to
train
them
to
turn
over
lab
reports?
now,
i
know
you
claim
you
had
that
policy.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
can
talk
later
about
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
evidence
for
the
jury
to
disbelieve
that
you
had
that
policy
or
not.
that's
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
question.
but
if
you
know
that
lab
reports
have
to
be
turned
over,
you've
conceded
it's
a
brady
violation
not
to
do
it,
and
there
was
sufficient
--
and
you
had
no
policy
--
i
know
you
are
disputing
that
--
and
you
had
no
policy
of
turning
it
over,
why
aren't
you
responsible
for
a
canton-like
violation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
for
certainty
you
know
that
a
lawyer's
judgment
is
going
to
go
astray
because
a
particular
area
of
law
is
that
complicated.
your
people
disagreed
--
some
of
your
people
disagreed
or
didn't
know
whether
turning
over
a
lab
report
was
a
--
failure
to
turn
over
a
lab
report
when
you
didn't
know
a
defendant's
blood
type
was
a
brady
violation.
that
has
been
conceded
in
this
case,
so
i
accept
as
a
working
proposition
that
they
should
have
known
that.
what
you
are
suggesting
is
you
get
a
pass
because,
even
though
you
know
that
there's
an
area
of
law
that
a
young
lawyer
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
figure
out
on
their
own,
you
fail
to
train
them
and
you're
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
that
is
not
the
canton
example.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
you
are
saying.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
understood
--
and
maybe
i'm
confused
--
that
you
were
arguing
that
there
was
no
set
of
circumstances
in
which
a
prosecutor
could
be
handled
--
could
be
liable
on
a
theory
of
failure
to
train
for
one
incident.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
that
was
the
petition.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
facts
are.
the
facts
that
justice
kagan
gave
you
would
never
constitute
an
actionable
claim
against
a
prosecutor;
is
that
your
position
in
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
that
wasn't
the
question
presented
to
us.
you
didn't
present
to
us
an
issue
of
whether
the
jury
instruction--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--was
wrong
or
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
see,
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is
whether
your
position
is
that
under
no
circumstance,
even
the
hypothetical
that
justice
kagan
set
forth,
could
you
be
charged
with
a
single
incident
canton
violation.
that
is
your
--
your
theory?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
brady
situation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
how
do
you
exercise
legal
judgment
if
you
don't
even
know
what
you
are
supposed
to
turn
over?
that
was
justice
ginsburg's
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
wait
a
minute.
what
evidence
is
there
that
they
put
this
in
their
hip
pocket?
there
was
a
disclosure
that
the
evidence
existed.
where
is
the
evidence
that
the
defense
counsel
didn't
have
access
to
asking
for
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
asking
for
it
to
be
tested?
where
was
that
suppressed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
where
is
the
brady
violation
for
telling
a
defense
attorney,
there
was
a
blood
sample
there,
you
can
test
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
you
are
claiming
there
was
suppression
of
that
evidence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
please
state
in
simple
terms
to
me
what
exactly
they
failed
to
train
these
prosecutors
to
do,
that
the
prosecutors
didn't
do?
what
training
--
justice
alito
asked
it
generally,
i'm
asking
specifically
--
what
is
the
exact
training
that
was
required
in
this
situation
that
caused
the
violation
in
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
forget
about
no
brady
training.
what
--
i
think
justice
alito
asked
this
question.
what
specifically
would
the
training
have
said
or
done
that
would
have
avoided
this
brady
violation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now
that
seems
to
suggest
that
you
are
claiming
that
if
there
was
an
intentional
violation
by
prosecutors,
that
that
statement
would
have
avoided
the
prosecutor
from
doing
something
he
or
she
knew
was
illegal.
is
that
what
you
are
intending?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
so
tell
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
goes
to
the
sufficiency--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--of
whether
they
had
a
policy
to
turn
over
or
--
because
it
was
tested,
so
there
was
no
brady
violation
from
the
failure
to
test
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
see,
it
was
tested.
and
it
was
made
available
to
the
defense.
turning
over
--
using
the
word
turning
over
is
ridiculous,
because
they
are
not
going
to
physically
give
it
to
the
defense
attorney
to
go
off
and
do
what
he
wants.
they
are
going
to
give
it
to
a
lab
that
will
establish
a
chain
of
custody,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
so
it
was
made
available.
he
went
to
look
at
it
but
the
looking
at
it
wouldn't
have
told
the
defense
attorney
anything.
they
had
to
make
it
available
for
testing.
he
never
asked
for
testing.
they
did
the
lab
reports.
so
now
we
come
down
to
the
only
failure
is
in
the
turning
over
of
this
report.
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now
what
did
i
just
say?
the
failure
to
turn
over
the
report.
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
never
knew
it
existed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
that
dooms
your
case--
if
it
wasn't
an
innocent
error,
if
it
was
an
intentional
violation
of
brady,
there
is
no
training
that
was
going
to
stop
him
from
doing
that.
