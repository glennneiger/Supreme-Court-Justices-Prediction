second,
would
the
instruction
in
your
view
have
been
proper,
if
the
"or"
had
been
replaced
by
an
"and",
so
"the
situation
involved
a
difficult
choice
and
one
that
prosecutors
had
a
history
of
mishandling.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
there
been
any
argument
that
you
have
waived
your
objection
to
the
instructions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words
the
pattern
instruction
was
--
it
was
--
was
rejected?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
at
the
--
but
at
the
outset
it
seemed
to
me,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
you
misstate
the
theory
on
which
you
seek
to
--
to
have
a
reversal
and
that
this
is
a
failure-to-train
case.
you
didn't
mention
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
failure-to-train
case,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
that's
very
important.
justice
anthony

and
miranda,
and
proper
supervision
of
affidavits
in
support
of
search
warrants,
and
proper
instructions
that
tell
the
police
not
to
exceed
the
scope
of
the
warrant.
so
this
is
--
our
course
is
expanding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
point
of
concern
here
is
that
we're
going
to
have
to
go
through
a
list,
case
by
case,
of
everything
there
has
to
be
training
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is
a
causation
problem
here.
even
assuming
training,
if
deegan
was
going
to
destroy
the
evidence,
or
remove
it
anyway,
as
he
admitted
later
to
rileman,
then
the
training
or
lack
of
training
is
just
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
very
concerned
about
that
causation
aspect.
