justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
we
just
--
can
we
clear
something
up?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
accepting
the
proposition
that
brady
always
requires
that
lab
reports
be
turned
over?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
know
you
concede
that
there
was
a
brady
violation
here,
but
in
answer
to
some
of
the
questions
it
seems
to
me
that
you
were
possibly
--
or
at
least
you
did
not
express
an
opinion
on
the
suggestion
that
it
is
always
a
violation
of
brady
to
fail
to
turn
over
a
lab
report.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
if
you
could
--
could
you
just
say
as
succinctly
as
possible
what
you
would
tell
assistant
district
attorneys
if
you
were
the
district
attorney
for
this
jurisdiction,
and
you
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
having
seen
this
case,
what
kind
of
--
what
would
you
tell
them
they
should
do
with
respect
to
brady?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
you
are
training
them,
so:
now
i
want
to
tell
you
what
you
have
to
do
under
brady.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
tell
them?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
really
would
appreciate
it
if
you'd
get
to
my
question.
brady
requires
that
exculpatory
evidence
be
turned
over.
now,
do
you
--
do
you
think
the
assistant
prosecutors
didn't
even
know
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
now,
you
phrase
--
you
are
the
instructor.
you
phrase
the
lesson
that
you
think
is
required
by
brady
that
has
to
be
given
to
them.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
mean,
with
respect,
i
really
don't,
as
a
young
district
--
assistant
district
attorney,
that
you
have
told
me
anything
that's
going
to
be
really
helpful
to
me
other
than,
you
know,
follow
the
law,
which
you
certainly
should
do,
in
dealing
with
my
obligation
to
turn
over
physical
evidence,
which
is
what's
involved
here.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
or
a
lab
report
regarding
physical
evidence.
now,
suppose
i
have
--
i
have
several
cases.
i
have
this
case,
where
i
have
got
blood
--
i
have
physical
evidence,
i
have
a
blood
test.
i
have
another
case
where
all
i
had
was
physical
evidence,
but
there
has
been
no
testing
on
it.
now,
do
i
have
to
turn
over
that
physical
evidence?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
have
to
turn
over
all
physical
evidence
that's
in
my
possession?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
what's
the
instruction
that
you
are
going
to
give
me
to
tell
me
where
i'm
going
to
draw
that
line?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
do
i
know
that
before--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--how
do
i
know
that
before
the
physical
evidence
is
tested?
suppose
i've
got
all
sorts
of
items
that
were
found
at
the
scene,
and
they
might
have
dna
on
them.
they
might
have
epithelial
samples
on
them.
you
know,
all
this
fancy
forensic
testing
that
is
done
these
days.
do
i
have
to
turn
over
all
of
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
you
see
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
very
specific
situation.
so
the
instruction
would
be:
if
you
have
physical
evidence
and
you
have
tested
it
for
blood
and
you
have
a
--
you
have
the
result
of
the
blood
test,
but
you
don't
know
whether
--
you
don't
know
the
blood
type
of
the
accused,
that
--
that's
brady
evidence,
and
that
has
to
be
turned
over.
and
you
are
saying
that
the
failure
to
provide
training
to
every
assistant
district
attorney
on
a
question
of
that
specificity
gives
rise
to
a
--
a
potential
claim,
gives
rise
to
a
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
judge
actually,
though,
instructed
the
jury
--
this
is
back
on
ja
828
--
in
order
to
find
that
the
district
attorney's
failure
to
adequately
train,
monitor
or
supervise
amounted
to
--
deliberate
indifference,
etcetera.
so
liability
could
have
been
predicated
not
on
the
lack
of
adequate
training,
but
the
absence
of
a
process
by
which
superiors
in
the
district
attorney's
office
reviewed
all
of
the
brady
decisions
that
were
made
by
more
junior
prosecutors;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
wouldn't
--
why
wouldn't
that
be
error?
that
is,
the
head
of
a
very
large
office
is
personally
liable
under
canton
for
violations
that
are
--
that
are
produced
by
actions
taken
by
subordinates,
unless
there
is
an
elaborate
process
to
review
all
of
the
decisions
that
are
made
by
those
subordinates?
doesn't
that
go
well
beyond
anything
canton
permits?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
cooney,
when
you
--
when
you
gave
the
specific
instruction
which
you
think
should
be
provided
to
assistant
district
attorneys,
what
you
stated
was
a
questionable
understanding
of
brady,
i
think.
you
--
did
i
understand
you
correctly?
you
said
that
brady
means
that
if
the
prosecutor
has
physical
evidence
which
if
tested
might
establish
the
defendant's
innocence,
that
is
exculpatory
evidence
that
must
be
turned
over?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
to
do
with
arizona
v
youngblood.
