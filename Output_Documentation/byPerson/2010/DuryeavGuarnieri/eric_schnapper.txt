mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
neither
the
text,
history,
or
purpose
of
the
petition
clause
nor
the
interest
of
a
government
employer
in
an
efficient
workplace
provide
a
basis
for
distinguishing
and
giving
less
protection
to
a
petition
because
it
didn't
involve
a
matter
of
public
concern.
the
text
of
the
petition
clause
certainly
draws
no
such
distinction.
the
subject
of
the
petition
must
be
a
grievance
and
a
grievance
i
think
is
measured
by
whether
the
matter
is
of
concern
to
the
petitioner.
if
it's
a
problem
of
concern
to
the
petitioner,
that
satisfies
that
constitutional
element.
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
public
cares
a
lot,
it
doesn't
care--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
with
all
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
this
court
is
committed
to
the
view
that
the
petition
clause
and
the
free
speech
clause
cover
exactly
the
same
things.
in
fact,
emphatically
they
--
obviously
they
don't
because
the
free
speech
clause
covers
many
things
that
the
petition
clause
would
not.
it
covered,
for
example,
the
remark--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
believe
so,
your
honor.
this
court's
decisions
in
the
antitrust
area
and
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
with
regard
to
--
an
--
access
to
the
government
or
--
or
the
courts,
they've
always
been
framed
solely
in
terms
of
the
petition
clause,
not
the
free
speech
clause.
it
would
be
at
least
very
awkward
to
characterize
those
--
those
problems
as
free
speech
cases,
particularly
where,
as
is
typically
the
case,
the
--
the
underlying
activity
was
on
the
part
of,
say,
a
lawyer
rather
than
an
individual
who
--
who
is
asserting
the
petition
right.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it
--
it's
our
view,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
--
and
in
this
respect
to
some
extent
i
think
we
agree
with
a
statement
made
by
petitioners
--
that
every
gripe
that
an
individual
employee
might
have,
indeed
most
of
them,
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
petition
clause.
in
the
petition
reply
brief,
the
petitioners
state,
and
we
agree
with
this,
that
the
ordinary,
routine
e-mails,
give
and
take
within
the
office,
that's
not
covered
by
the
petition
clause.
we
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
no,
your
honor.
that
--
that
--
that's
their
view,
that
--
that
it
becomes
a
matter
of
public
concern
if
you
say
it
affects
a
lot
of
people.
our
view
is
that
that's
not
relevant.
it--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no,
your
honor,
saying
that
wouldn't
have
that
effect.
the
case
to
which
they
refer
is
one
in
which
an
employee
indicated,
as
indeed
occurred,
that
he
was
going
to
file
a
lawsuit,
and
the
employer
retaliated
in
a
peremptory
fashion
because
of
that.
that
--
that's
been
the
rule
in
the
third
circuit,
it
has
only
come
up
twice,
but
if
i
might
point
out,
that's
the
rule
under
any
--
any
number
of
federal
statutes
which
protect
filing
a
charge
with
the
eeoc
or
filing
a
lawsuit.
the
lower
courts
have
agreed--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
your
honor.
the
government--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--the,
the
--
that
it,
the
government's
interest
as
an
employer
is
part
of
the
calculus
if
--
if
this
issue
arose
under
the
petition
clause,
and
under
ordinary
balancing
one
would
look
at
the
nature
of
the
government's
interest
and
the
degree
of
burden
that's
imposed,
and
that's
the
way
the
court
has
administered
the
petition
clause.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
that's
what
the
court
has
done.
now,
that
said,
i
think
there
are
circumstances
where
the
government
would
be
hard
pressed
to
argue
that
it
had
a
generalized
interest
in
stopping
a
particular
form
of
petition.
for
example,
the
petitioners
express
a
considerable
unhappiness
that
they're
subject
to
suit
under
section
1983.
it's
expensive,
it
requires
lawyers,
they
could
have
to
pay
counsel
fees.
those
are
judgments
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
made
in
1871
when
it
adopted
section
1983.
it
knew
the
government
was
--
local
governments
would
be
subject
to
it.
when
the
congress
strikes
that
balance,
and
--
and
of
course,
section
1983
is
a
very
complicated
piece
of
machinery
--
the
balance
congress
struck
is
--
is
ordinarily
going
to
be
controlling--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--your
honor,
the
--
the
federal
government
is
not
obligated
to
provide
a
--
a
lower
court
system
for
--
authorized
to
hear
suits
against
it.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
can.
but
it
cannot
set
up
a
court
system
and
then
punish
government
employees
for
using
it.
they
are
not
--
historic
--
if
i
might
step
back
a
couple
hundred
years
here,
the--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no,
i
think
--
i
think
historically
that
--
that's
a
fairly
accurate
description
of
what
has
happened
with
the
emergence
of
the
petition
clause
over
the
last
6
or
700
years
of
anglo-american
history.
there
were
no
courts
to
which
people
could
seek
redress
against
the
crown
at
the
time
of
magna
carta.
over
time
the
courts
became
available
to
do
that.
insofar
as
they
did,
on
our
view,
the
petition
clause
would
now
apply.
and
if
i
might
turn
to
a
question
you
asked
earlier.
you
expressed
some
skepticism
about
whether
the
petition
clause
applies
to
lawsuits.
i
note
that
in
at
least
half
a
dozen
decisions
that
this
court
has
held
that,
and
i
think
that
was
the
premise
of
your
concurring
opinion
in
the
be
&
k
construction
case
a
few
years
ago.
and
we
don't
in
this
regard
have
to
get
deeply
into
history
in
the
debate
about
whether
courts
are
covered.
the
text
of
the
first
--
of
the
petition
clause
is
sufficient
on
its
face.
it
doesn't
say
petitions
to
the
legislature.
it
says
petitions
to
the
government,
and
that
was
clearly
a
deliberate
choice,
because
the
states--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
those
cases
are
clearly
distinguishable.
the
--
the
core
historical
purpose
of
concern
of
the
petition
clause
was
reprisals
by
the
government
against
people
for
--
for
petitioning
the
government.
there's
a
fundamental
difference
here
between
what's
at
stake
here,
where
the
borough
is
asserting
a
right
to
punish
people
for
going
to
court,
and
the
question
about
whether
the
government
has
an
affirmative
obligation
to
remove
the
incidental
barriers
that
may
exist
to
bringing
lawsuits.
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
so,
we
think
those
cases
are
distinguishable.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
no,
precisely
to
the
contrary.
we
are
asserting
only
that
the
government
cannot
punish
mr.
guarnieri
for
filing
a
lawsuit.
we
are
not
suggesting
the
government
has
to
pay
his
filing
fee,
any
more
than
if
--
if
the
--
if
mr.
guarnieri
wants
to
go
to
harrisburg
and
meet
with
his
or
her
representative,
the
government,
our
view,
duryea,
can't
punish
him
for
doing
it,
but
they
don't
have
to
give
him
gas
money,
and
if
he
doesn't
have
enough
money
for
gas
that's
just
too
bad.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
the
--
we
believe
the
petition
clause
applies
to
government-created
mechanisms
for
redressing
grievances;
and
if
the
government
sets
up
an
arbitration
procedure
like
that,
we
think
that
that's
covered.
an
arbitration
agreement
between
two
private
parties
would
not
be,
be
covered
by
the
petition
clause,
because
the
government
wouldn't
have
been
involved
in
standing
that
up.
and
that
distinction
really
has
its
roots
in
history.
the
petition
started
out;
back
at
the
time
of
magna
carta
petitions
only
went
to
the
king.
over
time
the
british
government
and
ultimately
the
american
government
developed
other
mechanisms
that
were
simply
more
efficient.
so
that,
for
example,
at
the
time
the
petition
clause
was
written,
congress
received
a
large
number
of
petitions
from
wounded
veterans,
and
after
several
years
of
dealing
with
that
it
adopted
the
invalid
pension
act
and
turned
that
over
to
a
somewhat
unusual
combination
of
administrative
and
judicial
officials.
so
i
think
the
creation
of--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i'm
not
familiar
with
english
law
in
that
respect.
with
regard
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
i
think
it's
california
motor
transport,
which
i
think
is
about
40
years
ago.
mr.
eric
schnapper
about
40.
mr.
eric
schnapper
there's
precious
little--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--many
of
the
constitutional
issues
this
court
deals
with
were
not
raised
for
--
for
a
very
long
period
of
time.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it
would
have
been
a
petition.
it
would
not
necessarily
have
been
protected.
the
government
has
an
interest
in
such
matters
as
an
employer,
and
that
might
indeed
outweigh--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--right,
right.
the
question
is,
was
the--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--the
question
i
take
it
you're
asking
is
--
is
whether
the
garcetti
principle
would
apply
to
a
petition
clause
case
where
the
government
--
it
was
part
of
the
official--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
don't
--
i
don't
think
--
the
specific
question
is
whether
the
garcetti
rule
should
apply
in
a
petition
clause
case.
i
don't
think
we
have
a
position
on
that.
it's
not
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
eric
schnapper
probably
not
in
the
sense
that
you're
asking.
there
would
be
a
threshold
inquiry
as
to
whether
what
had
happened
was
petitioning.
if
it
were,
this
court's
decisions
indicate
that
the
court
might
impose
a
threshold
inquiry
consistent
with,
say,
the
line
of
cases,
most
recently
be&k
construction,
as
to
whether
the
underlying
petition
had
a
--
a
reasonable
basis
or
was
--
had
been
pursued
in
good
faith.
but
i
think
if
you
got
past
that,
then
there
would
be
no
further
threshold.
mr.
eric
schnapper
as
you
describe
it,
on
our
view,
not
so,
because
our
view
is
that,
putting
aside
the
historical
and
somewhat
unusual
but
less
common
instance
of
a
petition
directed
to,
let's
say
at
the
federal
level
the
congress
or
the
president,
the
petition
clause
ordinarily
applies
only
where
the
government
has
created
a
specific
remedial
mechanism
for
addressing
a
particular
kind
of
grievance.
it's
something
that's
just
outside
the
ordinary
give-and-take
of
the
office,
something
like,
you
know,
a
separate
agency
or
an
arbitrator
or
a
court,
something
like
that.
and
that
--
there's
an
historical--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no.
no,
it
isn't.
that's
the
--
historically,
that's
the
kind
of
distinction
that
was
there.
if
you
had
a
problem
in
england,
if
the
undersheriff
took
your
cow,
you
could
go
to
the
sheriff,
but
historically,
that
wasn't
called
a
petition.
if
you
went
to
the
king,
that
was
a
petition.
it
was
not
going
to
the
local.
so
we
--
we
do
have
a
great
deal
of
historical
material,
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
about
individuals,
including
federal
government
officials,
petitioning
congress.
and
i
--
we
think
the
framers
would
have
regarded
those
as
petitions.
i
don't
think
they
would
regard
a
beef
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
as
--
as
--
so
we
would
--
there's
no--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no.
no,
your
honor.
our
view,
as
i
indicated
to
justice
alito,
is
that
a
gripe
within
the
office,
whether
you
label
it
a
petition
or
not,
would
not,
except
in
maybe
some
extraordinary
circumstance,
constitute
a
petition.
but
if
i
might
respond,
i
think
your
question
raises
a
second
important
linguistic
point,
which
is
the
word
18th
century.
we
think
of
petitions
as
the
things
you
see
out
on
tables,
along
the
street;
people
say,
come
on,
sign
my
petition
to
do
this,
that,
or
the
other
thing.
that
was
not
a
common
phenomena
in
the
18th
century.
petitions
were
ordinarily
things
from
one
individual
or
a
couple
of
people.
there
were
some
exceptions,
but
that
was
--
that
was
not
the
normal
--
the
normal
practice.
in
fact,
the
very
idea
that
you
could
have
large
numbers
of
people
signing
something
called
a
petition
was
much
controverted
at
that
time.
mr.
eric
schnapper
there
--
there
were.
it
came
to
be
used
that
way
as
--
that
is
largely
a--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--it
is,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
is
a
19th
and
20th-century
phenomenon.
you
see
very
little
of
that
in
the
18th
century
or
earlier.
and
i'd
note,
although
--
i
mean,
i,
i
think
that
if
that's
done
by
private
individuals
and
directed
to
the
government,
it
would
be
protected
by
the
petition
clause.
i
note,
just
to
give
you
a
sense
of
the
history,
that
at
the
time
that
happened,
its
legitimacy
was
challenged,
and
the
argument
was
made
by
the
proponents
of
slavery
in
support
of
a
gag
order
adopted
by
congress
that
this
was
not
really
a
legitimate
petition.
the
legitimate
petition
ought
to
be
something
about
your
personal
problems;
an
abolitionist
really
had
no
business
signing
these
things;
it
wasn't
a
personal
grievance.
now,
i
think
that's
wrong.
i
think
it's
certainly
not
consistent
with
current
case
law.
but
it
illustrates
how
the
position
advanced
by
petitioners
stands
on
its
head
the
historical
evolution
of
the
petition
clause,
which
starts
as
about
private
matters,
and
only
over
time
and
after
a
good
deal
of
struggle
is
it
extended
to
things
of
broader
concern
and
possibly
a
petition
signed
by
people
who
don't
have
a
personal
stake
in--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--right.
right.
that's
right.
mr.
eric
schnapper
exactly.
and
here
we
part
company
with
--
i
think
the
government
expressed
the
concern
in
its
brief
and
perhaps
at
oral
argument
--
i
guess
it
was
petitioner
that
made
this
point
--
that
there
was
something
amiss
about
government
employees
having
rights
that
private
employees
don't.
that
distinction
exists
because
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
--
and
the
other
constitutional
guarantees,
with
the
exception
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
the
right
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce,
those
rights
don't
apply
to
private
--
to
people
dealing
with
private
employers.
that's
just--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--and
--
and
we're
not
taking
issue
with
the
assertion
of
the
government
that
the
government
as
an
employer
has
interests
which
are
different
than
it
--
it
--
those
it
has
just
as
a
sovereign.
but
that
distinction
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
distinction
they
propose
in
this
case
between
matters
of
public
concern
and
matters
of
only
private
concern.
indeed,
to
the
contrary.
to
the
extent
that
the
government's
--
the
government's
interests
might
be
greater,
surely
a
petition
that
deals
with
a
matter
of
public
importance
is
going
to
cause
the
government
a
lot
more
trouble
than
a
purely
private
matter.
a
lawsuit
alleging
systemic
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
religion
or
even
an
individual,
if
--
if
mr.
guarnieri
had
alleged
and
a
court
had
found
that
he
had
been
fired
because
he
was
catholic,
the
ramifications
politically
and
in
terms
of
just
--
the
ramifications
in
terms
of
the
workplace
would
have
been
far
more
serious
than
the--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--with
all
due
respect,
our
view
is
it
depends
whether
or
not
the
--
the
employee
is
acting
as
a
petitioner
within
the
meaning
of
the
petition
clause.
the
petition
clause
was
not
adopted,
like
the
free
speech
clause,
to
foster
a
vigorous
public
debate.
the
purpose
of
the
petition
clause,
as
the
court
said
in
christopher
v.
harbury,
is
to
enable
an
individual
to
seek
relief
for
a
wrong.
and
that
has
--
that's
not
the
same
as
the
--
the
free
speech
interests
that
--
that
might
exist
to
engage
as
a
citizen
in
a
robust
public
debate.
mr.
guarnieri
didn't
file
his
complaint
in
federal
court,
for
example,
looking
to
the
second
petition,
in
the
hopes
of
a
robust
debate
between
himself
and
judge
caputo.
he
--
he
filed
that
complaint
to
get
redress
for
an
alleged
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
so
--
so
the
citizen
versus
employee
distinction
in
--
in
connick
is
inapt
here.
it's
--
it's
--
it's
rooted
in
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
free
speech
clause,
which
is
protecting
vigorous
public
debate
on
matters
of
public
concern.
the
petition
clause
is
not
about
matters
of
public
concern.
it's
about
--
about
people's
ability
to
seek
redress.
it
doesn't
guarantee
redress,
but
it
protects
the
ability
to
ask
for
it.
the--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
that
is
a
serious
problem
for
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
petitioners
have
in
--
in
highly
expressive
language
described
the
decision
in
filippo
as
one
which
would
lead
to
an
avalanche,
tsunami,
an
overwhelming
number
of
new
lawsuits.
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
that
they
had
not
adduced
any
evidence
that
any
such
thing
had
happened
in
the
17
years
since
san
filippo.
their
reply
brief
does
not
purport
to
have
any
information
to
--
to
support
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
your
--
i
think
there
are
two
--
two
other
reasons
why
this
is
not
a
--
a
major
concern.
the
first
one
is
it
simply
isn't
the
case
that
you
could
take
any
beef,
write
"federal
complaint"
at
the
top
of
it
and
file
it
in
federal
court
and
be
protected.
most
internal
gripes
don't
raise
a
colorable
claim
under
federal
or
state
law,
and
this
court's
petition
clause
cases
make
it
clear
that
a
petition,
particularly
a
lawsuit,
that
doesn't
have
a
reasonable
basis
simply
isn't
going
to
be
protected.
it's
also,
to
be
frank,
based
on
my
contact
with
private
petitioners,
it's
highly
unrealistic
to
suggest
that
if
an
employee,
government
employee,
took
some
gripe
and
went
to
a
lawyer
and
said,
let's
file
this
in
federal
court,
i
want
to
get
it
off
my
chest,
to
find
a
lawyer
on
a
contingent
fee
basis
that
is
going
to
do
that.
if
a
chance
case
has
no
chance
of
success,
you're
not
going
to
find
a
lawyer
who
will
do
it;
and
on
a
police
officer's
salary,
you're
certainly
not
going
to
be
able
to
hire
one.
third--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--few
--
few
private
lawyers
who
aren't
independently
wealthy
are
going
to
take
a
baseless
case
on
the
theory
that
they're
going
to
get
some
umbrella
settlement.
it's
just
--
it
simply
doesn't
happen.
it
--
it
--
and
realistically,
we
don't
really
have
a
plausible
account
of
why
an
employee
would
do
this.
i
mean,
you're
an
employee,
you're
unhappy
with
the
way
you're
being
treated
at
work,
you--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--your
honor,
this--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--your
honor,
i
can
certainly
tell
you
that
people
who
are
upset
all
the
time
call
me
ostensibly
unable
to
find
lawyers.
i
mean,
remember,
the
--
the
fact
that
mr.
guarnieri
was
able
to
find
a
lawyer
to
take
this
case
doesn't
prove
that
people
can
find
lawyers
to
take
baseless
cases.
mr.
guarnieri
found
a
lawyer,
she
brought
this
case,
she
got
past
summary
judgment,
she
took
it
to
trial
and
she
won.
this
is
a
case
that
not
only
had
a
substantial
basis,
but
on
the
facts,
and
this
issue
is
no
longer
before
us,
she
prevailed.
if
the
court
has
no--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no,
they
--
they
--
certainly
they
happen,
but
the
notion
that
this
is
going
to
unleash
a
flood
of
them
seems
to
me
unrealistic.
a
particular
institution
like
this
where
the
theory
of
this
is
that
the
private
--
the
government
employee
reads
connick,
realizes
they
can't
write
a
letter
to
the
boss
with
--
with
their
gripe,
and
undissatisfied
with
their
ability
to
talk
about
it
with
friends
and
family
and
gripe
with
pals
at
the
bar,
decides
that
the
only
way
they
can
get
it
off
their
chest
is
to
have
it
be
in
a
complaint
in
some
federal
courthouse,
where
it
would
then
probably
be
dismissed.
i
think
in
the
real
world
that's
something
that
would
make
very
little
sense
to
an
employee.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
