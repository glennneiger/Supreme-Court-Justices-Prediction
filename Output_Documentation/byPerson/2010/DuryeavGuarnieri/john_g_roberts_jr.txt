chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-1476,
the
borough
of
duryea
v.
guarnieri.
mr.
ortiz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
ortiz.
mr.
palmore.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
schnapper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
all
of
our
cases
have
equated
the
petition
clause
reach
with
that
of
the
first
amendment,
and
our
cases
under
the
first
amendment
have
made
clear
that
we
don't
want
to
constitutionalize
the
--
the
employee
grievance
procedures.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
petition
clause
cover
anything
that
the
first
amendment
does
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
getting
back
to
the
second
part
of
my
question--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
the
first
amendment
cases
we
were
concerned
about,
as
i
said,
constitutionalizing
employee
grievances.
if
you
constitutionalize
it
under
the
petition
clause,
how
is
that
any
less
a
problem
of
constitutionalizing
it
under
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
you
have
to
do
then
is
add
a
sentence
to
your
complaint
saying:
this
is
an
example
of
how
the
government
employer
mistreats
its
employees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
then
it
becomes
more
generalized?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
--
but
that's
the
basis
of
our
law
in
this
area
is
that
when
the
government
is
actually
the
employer
the
rights
of
the
individuals
are
somewhat
different,
and
they're
closer
to
the
rights
that
private
employees
have.
so
simply
saying
that
these
constitutional
provisions
apply
against
the
government
and
therefore,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
distinction
between
private
employers
and
government
employers
doesn't
seem
to
be
--
me
to
be
completely
responsive
to
our
precedent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
things
will
be
a
lot
different
if
we
give
the
sanction
to
your
theory.
i
think
the
idea
that
it
hasn't
happened
in
17
years
in
the
wake
of
san
filippo
is
a
little
bit
--
it's
not
very
compelling.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
most
likely
solution
when
you
have
an
employee
grievance
along
with
it
is
that
some
umbrella
settlement
--
i
mean,
the
employer
doesn't
want
to
spend
--
i
mean,
that's
part
of
the
reason
our
doctrine
developed
under
the
first
amendment.
the
employer
doesn't
want
to
have
to
worry
about
spending
time
and
money
in
court
to
resolve
what
is
essentially
an
employee
grievance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
palmore,
you
have
a
minute
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
