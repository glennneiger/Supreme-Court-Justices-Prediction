justice

what
kind
of
case,
hypothetically,
would
qualify
under
your
theory
as
a
petitioning
case
to
the
sovereign?
would
a
claim
of
retaliation
because
of
a
termination
based
on
race
qualify?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
doesn't
that
get
to
the
--
to
the
merits
of
the
case?
you
have
to
from
--
you
can't
invite
a
question
as
to
whether
the
sovereign
is
responsible
until
you
litigate
the
issue.
so
what
is
the
--
addressing
justice
scalia's
question
to
you,
what
would
qualify
as
a
petition
to
the
employer
as
opposed
to
a
petition
to
the
sovereign
and
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
those
are
clear
cases.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
was
asking
the
flip.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
much
of
your
argument
is
premised
on
the
fact
that
there
was
an
alternative
mechanism
to
the
court
system
available.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
meaning
let's
assume
there
wasn't
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
let's
assume
there
wasn't
a
state
law
protection,
all
of
the
items
that
you
mention
in
your
brief
as
existing
to
resolve
disputes,
that
the
only
avenue
for
redress
were
the
courts.
so
where
would
that
put
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
putting
it
aside.
you
--
you
were
talking
about
constitutionalizing
a
grievance
process.
i'm
going
more
broadly
and
saying
how
much
of
your
argument
depends
on
that
fact?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
was
the
meaning
would
--
it
is
harder
if
all
they
have
access
to
is
a
court
proceeding.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about
if
they
don't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about
if
they
don't?
that's
my
point.
then
what
happens
to
the
third
circuit's
definition?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counselor,
your
client
won
everything
in
his
collective
bargaining
grievance.
he
got
his
pay
back,
he
got
them
to
stop
doing
what
they
did,
and
he
found
a
lawyer
to
file
a
constitutional
claim.
so
your
suggestion
that
lawyers
won't
fight
semi-chaotic
adventures
is
realistic
as
well.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
people
get
upset
about
how
they're
treated
all
of
the
time,
and
they
find
lawyers
to
file
suits
about
that
treatment.
