why
would
it
make
--
why
would
it
make
a
difference
at
what
you
call
the
balancing
stage
whether
it
is
--
whether
the
distinction
is
between
public
speech
and
private
speech
on
the
one
hand
or
government
as
employer
and
government
as
sovereign
on
the
other?
why
would
there
be
any
difference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ortiz,
you're
not
drawing
any
line
depending
on
the
branch
of
government,
in
other
words,
executive,
legislature.
those
are
certainly
branches
of
government
to
which
one
can
petition.
but
access
to
court
you
agree
comes
within
the
petition
clause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
--
this
as
i
understand
it,
came
up
originally
as
arbitration
under
the
--
wasn't
it
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
that
count
also,
because
it
is
a
mechanism
set
up
by
a
government
employer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
not
challenging
that,
as
i
understand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
palmore,
what
about
the
distinction
that
the
other
side
brings
up
that
connick
is
about
what
happens
inside
the
workplace
--
you
don't
want
to
disrupt
the
routine
by
the
kind
of
activity
in
which
myers
was
involved
--
but
the
petition
clause,
they're
talking
about
conduct
outside
the
workplace,
that
is
a
complaint
filed
in
court,
nothing
that's
happening
in
the
workplace.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
if
added
to
that
is
"and
i'm
going
to
sue"
or
"i'm
going
to
file
a
grievance?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schnapper,
you
can
write
a
letter
to
the
president,
you
can
write
a
letter
to
your
congressional
representative,
but
getting
to
a
court,
you
have
to
pay
a
filing
fee.
and
since
this
would
be
a
civil
case,
this
court
has
held
if
you
haven't
got
whatever
is
the
filing
fee
amount,
too
bad,
you
don't
have
access
to
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
that
in
one
of
these
suits
you
wouldn't
have
to
pay
the
filing
fee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schnapper,
this
is
not
--
if
you're
--
if
you're
talking
about
the
practical
significance,
myers
in
connick
was
going
around
the
office,
collecting
signatures.
she
was
taking
a
poll.
she
was
taking
a
poll
and
the
poll
was
going
to
be
presented
to
the
employer.
that
sounds
much
more
petition-like
than
filing
a
grievance
pursuant
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
so
the
--
the
distinction
between
connick,
who
was
taking
a
poll
--
why
wasn't
that
a
petition?
maybe
--
did
she
just
put
the
wrong
label
on
it?
if
she
called
her
case
a
petition
case,
it
would
have
been
all
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schnapper,
let's
come
to
the
century
in
which
we
are
now
living.
we
have
title
vii.
title
vii
has
this
provision,
an
explicit
provision
against
retaliation.
but
suppose
it
didn't.
suppose
it
just
prohibited
discrimination
and
it
didn't
have
a
retaliation
clause.
it's
the
thrust
of
your
arguments
that
the
government
employee
would
have
a
claim
for
retaliation,
although
someone
in
the
private
sector
would
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
do,
i
think,
recognize
that
it
would
be
possible
then
to
circumvent
connick
if
you
could
turn
around
and
file
a
pleading
and
say:
now
i
have
a
petition,
not
just
a
grievance.
