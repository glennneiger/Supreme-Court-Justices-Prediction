justice
antonin
scalia
you
agree
that
the
petition
clause
is
--
is
different
and
does
have
a
separate
content?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
speech
clause,
in
the
employment
context,
has
been
interpreted
to
cover
the
content.
whether
it
--
whether
it
applies
or
not
depends
upon
the
content,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
want
the
petition
clause
also
to
turn
on
the
content?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
either
petitioning
the
government
or
you're
not
petitioning
the
government.
why
--
why
shouldn't
the
line
be,
if
you're
petitioning
the
government
as
employer
is
different
from
petitioning
the
government
as
ruler?
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
line
that
we
draw?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
wouldn't
necessarily
break
out
the
same
way
as
whether
it's
a
matter
of
private
concern
versus
a
matter
of
public
concern.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
core
--
the
core
of
the
petition
clause
is
petitioning.
the
core
of
the
free
speech
clause
is
political
speech,
of
course
--
speech
in
public
interest
--
but
the
core
of
the
petition
clause
is
quite
different.
it's
simply
whether
you're
petitioning.
surely
you
--
you
could
petition
the
--
most
of
the
petitions
in
the
early
years
were
regarding
private
matters;
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
--
the
core
is
involved
whenever
you're
asking
for
a
change.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
key
distinction,
if
there
is
one,
is
whether
you're
asking
for
a
change
in
--
by
your
employer
in
your
employment
conditions
or
a
change
by
the
government
in
some
matters
over
which
the
government
has
control
as
--
as
sovereign.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
well
be,
may
well
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
they
have
to
do
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
proceeding
with
a
claim
under
two
separate
provisions
of
the
constitution,
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
you
might
have
two
different
tests.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
all
you're
saying
is
that
one
of
the
elements
of
pickering
balancing
is
the
element
of
petition
clause
jurisprudence,
as
i
suggested
it
--
it
might
be
applied;
that
is,
in
pickering
balancing,
certainly
you
have
to
ask,
was
what
the
individual
was
asking
for
a
change
in
employment
conditions?
that
would
be
one
of
the
questions.
if
so,
it
was
a
private
matter,
and
then
you
go
on
to
the
rest
of
the
balancing.
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
make
that
determination
under
pickering
balancing
anyway,
and
once
you
make
it,
you've
answered
the
--
the
petition
clause
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
have
to
wrestle
with
the
same
problem
if
you
apply
the
other
test
that
you
--
you
were
proposing.
justice
antonin
scalia
namely,
whether
it's
a
private
matter
or
a
matter
of
public
concern.
you
confront
the
same
difficulty,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
--
if
lawsuits
are
covered
by
the
petition
clause,
why
is
it
that
in
the
innumerable
cases
this
court
has
had
concerning
what
due
process
of
law
consists
of,
we've
never
mentioned
what
the
petition
clause
requires.
i
mean,
if
the
petition
clause
guarantees
access
to
the
courts,
certainly
there
are
some
minimum
requirements
that
it
imposes
as
well,
and
i
don't
recall
any
of
our
cases
dealing
with
lawsuits
that
mention
the
petition
clause.
that's
rather
extraordinary
if
indeed
it
governs
all
lawsuits.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
that's
all
they
had
in
mind,
or
petitions
to
the
executive
as
well.
what
--
what
evidence
do
you
have
that
it
applied
to
lawsuits?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
you
that
that's
slender.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
wouldn't
a
--
a
written
letter
to
--
to
the
employer,
the
government
employer,
similarly
be
a
petition?
is
a
lawsuit
any
more
of
a
petition,
if
indeed
it
is
a
petition
at
all,
which
i
doubt?
surely
filing
a
statement
with
the
employer
is
a
petition
as
well.
so
how
does
the
form
make
any
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
talk
about
it.
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
lawsuits
are
covered
by
the
petition
clause
when
it
is
very
clear
that
the
congress
can
prevent
all
lawsuits
against
the
federal
government
by
simply
refusing
to
waive
sovereign
immunity.
now,
you
know,
how
can
you
have
a
constitutional
guarantee
of
the
right
to
petition
the
government,
which
you
say
includes
the
--
the
right
to
--
to
be
in
law
court,
and
yet
the
federal
government
can
exempt
itself
from
suits
in
law
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
just
a
lower
court
system.
i'm
talking
about
all
suits,
right
up
to
the
supreme
court.
the
federal
government
can
say:
you
can't
sue
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
the
petition
clause
only
covers
those
petitions
that
the
government
chooses
to
allow;
is
--
is
that
what
the
constitutional
guarantee
is?
if
you
choose
to
allow
a
certain
kind
of
petition,
it
is
constitutionally
guaranteed.
that's
not
much
of
a
guarantee.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
earliest
english
or
american
case
you
have
that
refers
to
a
lawsuit
as
protected
by
the
petition
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many?
justice
antonin
scalia
40
years
ago.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
for
a
couple
hundred
years,
nobody
--
nobody
connected
the
two?
