mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
third
circuit
rule
here
at
issue
is
flawed
for
two
fundamental
reasons.
first,
contrary
to
this
court's
admonitions,
it
quite
literally
constitutionalizes
the
employee
grievance
process
by
supplanting
carefully
calibrated
nonconstitutional
safeguards
and
by
providing
a
potential
first
amendment
claim
in
federal
court
to
any
employee
who
has
filed
a
grievance
on
a
matter
of
only
private
interest.
and
second--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--that
certainly--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
it's
a
hard
hypothetical
to
answer,
of
course,
because
the
grievance
was
filed
pursuant
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
i
think
that's
an
important
part--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--i
think
that's
an
important
part
of
the
argument,
for
this
reason:
if
you
look
at
the
third
circuit's
case
in
san
filippo,
the
court
had
a
kind
of
a
doctrinal
basis
for
its
ruling,
but
it
also
had
a
practical
concern
that
not
affording
protection
for
this
kind
of
petitioning
activity
would
be
a
trap
to
the
unwary.
but
there
was
really
no
basis
for
that
concern,
because
the
issue
here
is
when
a
sovereign
provides
a
remedial
mechanism
or
enters
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
provides
a
remedial
mechanism--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--it
typically
--
well--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
then
i
think
the
--
the
result
is
the
same,
and
--
and
our
position
is
you
--
you
still
apply
connick,
just
as
speech
on
matters
of
private
concern
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
yet
under
connick,
an
employee
who
engages
in
speech
on
a
matter
of
private
concern
is
not
going
to
be
protected
in
the
employment
context
in
all
respects.
and
that
reflects
a
very
important
balance
that
this
court
has
struck
between
its
view
of
how
the
constitution
applies
to
the
government
as
sovereign
regulator
of
the
general
public
and
how
it
applies
to
the
government
and
its
proprietary
status
as
an
employer.
and
in
that
latter
situation,
connick
has
been
critical
in
providing
a
bulwark
against
allowing
run-of-the-mill
employment
disputes
from
becoming
constitutional
cases
in
federal
court.
and
the
second
main
problem
with
the
third
circuit's
approach,
and
it's
one
that
mr.
ortiz
highlighted,
is
that
it
privileges
petition
activity
over
speech
activity,
contrary
to
this
court's
numerous
statements
that
there
is
no
such
hierarchy
in
the
first
amendment.
so
going
back
to
thomas
v.
collins
in
1945,
the
court
called
the
two
rights
inseparable.
in
the
united
mine
workers
case,
which
is
a
case
relied
on
by
the
other
side,
it's
an
access
to
courts
case,
the
court
interchangeably
applied
the
speech
right,
the
petition
right,
and
the
assembly
right,
and
it
said
they
were
intimately
connected
in
origin
and
purpose.
and,
of
course--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--no,
please.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
it
--
it
likely
would
be,
and
i
think
this
--
this
goes
to
some
of
the
questions
justice
scalia
was
asking.
but
as
this
court
said
in
connick
that
the
question
about
--
of
whether
speech
is
a
matter
of
public
concern
is
assessed
not
only
by
the
content,
but
by
the
form
and
the
context.
so
in
the
case
that
your
honor
is
positing,
the
content
of
the
--
of
the
speech,
which
was
that
an
act
of
the
legislature
was
illegal,
would
suggest
that
it
was
a
matter
of
public
concern,
the
form,
the
form
of
a
lawsuit
is
relevant
to
the
consideration,
and
the
context
that
it
came
in
part
of
a
larger
political
debate
would
likely
be
relevant,
too.
the
problem
with
the
third
circuit
approach
is
that
it
never
engages
in
that
kind
of
inquiry.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
it
very
well
might
be.
that's
similar
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
givon
case.
so
that
was
a
case
where
a
teacher
went
to
complain
to
her
principal
about
the
school's
general
policy
of
discrimination,
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
speech
on
a
matter
of
public
concern,
that
it
affected
more
than
just
that
individual
employee's
employment
status.
so
many
of
these
hypotheticals
and
many
submissions
and
petitions
to
the
government
as
sovereign
will,
in
fact,
satisfy
the
public
concern
test,
and
then
you'll
get
into
pickering
balancing.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think
that,
no,
if
you
put
it
in
that
way;
this
court
has
never
separately
analyzed
the
two.
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
i
think
the
connick
test
already
takes
into
account
the
distinction
between
what
might
be
deemed
petitioning
conduct
and
non-petitioning
conduct
because
of
its
use
of
the
term
"form".
so,
again,
the
connick
test
calls
on
courts
to
look
on
the
content,
the
context
and
the
form.
so
if
the
form
of
an
employee
complaint
takes
the
form
of
a
lawsuit
filed
in
federal
court,
that's
something
that
--
that
should
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
--
it's
--
i
think
it's
a
serious
question
about
whether
a
letter
submitted
to
an
employer
as
an
employer,
not
as
a
sovereign,
is
a
petition.
but
that's
the
kind
of
line-drawing
that
the
third
circuit
approach
requires.
this
court
has
had
a
very
broad
conception
of
what
counts
as
petitioning
activity,
so
in
edwards
v.
south
carolina
the
court
said
that
a
march
to
the
grounds
of
the
state
capitol
in
south
carolina
to
protest
segregation
was
an
example
of
petitioning
conduct
in
its
most
classic
and
pristine
form.
the
third
circuit
doesn't
--
doesn't
count
--
wouldn't
count
that
as
a
petition
for
this
purpose.
it
has
kind
of
a
gerrymandered
view
of
what
will
count
as
a
petition,
basically
a
lawsuit
and
an
employee
grievance.
now,
the
--
the
approach
followed
by
the
majority
of
the
circuits
and
the
approach
we
advocate
today
doesn't
require
that
kind
of
line-drawing,
because
whether,
for
example,
the
grievance
filed
in
this
case
is
a
petition
or
not,
it's
certainly
speech,
and
so
we
would
agree
that
it's
susceptible
to
analysis
under
the
normal
connick
v.
myers
framework.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
i
think
it's
workplace-related
and
i
think
that's
the
test.
so
i
don't
think
it
--
you
know,
where
an
employee
physically
was
when
he
or
she
filed
the
petition
isn't
really
relevant.
the
question
is
the
connection
to
the
workplace
and
the
connection
to
the
employer-employee
relationship.
so
as
mr.
ortiz
answered
before,
the
nteu
case
provides
a
separate
set
of
protections
under
the
first
amendment,
under
the
speech
protection
for
employees
who
engage
in
speech
conduct
that
has
no
connection
to
the
workplace,
and
it
would
limit
the
ability
of
a
government
employer
to
take
action
against
such
an
employee.
but
the
conduct
here
is
the
--
the
grievances
that
were
filed
here
were
obviously
intimately
connected
to
the
workplace
relationship
between
chief
guarnieri
and
the
borough
council.
this
was
not
a
case
like
nteu,
where
someone
wanted
to
go
out
and
give
a
speech
on
something
that
had
no
connection
to
their
job
or
go
out
and
file
a
lawsuit
or
some
kind
of
petitioning
activity
on
something
that
had
no
connection
to
the
workplace.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
it
very
well
might
be.
it's
hard
to
answer
in
the
abstract,
because
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
the
question
has
to
be
analyzed
in
light
of
the
whole
record
and
in
light
of
the
context
--
content,
the
context,
and
the
form.
it's
not
necessary
for
this
court
in
this
case
to
decide
whether
the
petitioning
and
speech
activity
here
was
on
a
matter
of
public
or
private
concern.
the
question
presented
says
that
it
was
on
a
matter
of
private
concern.
so
all
the
court
needs
to
decide
is
--
is
whether
that
makes
a
difference
or
not
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
analysis.
and
then
the
third
circuit
on
remand
could
--
could
decide,
assuming
the
arguments
were
preserved,
could
look
at
the
whole
record
and
decide
whether
the
speech
activity
here
was
on
a
matter
of
public
or
private
concern.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
ask
the
judgment
be
reversed.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
your
honor,
it
defies
the
imagination
that
the
radical
republicans
and
the
framers
understood
that
the
petition
clause
would
constitutionalize
public
employee
grievance,
and
as
academic
commentary
that
respondent
cites
suggests,
their
--
respondents
long-centered
view
of
the
petition
clause
would
call
into
question,
sovereign
immunity
doctrine,
parts
of
rule
11,
suggest
a
right
to
appeal
and
a
right
to
judicial
review
whenever
anyone
has
agreed
to
government
action.
there
is
also
a
danger
that
it
would
constitutionalize
the
arbitration
process
whenever
the
government
is
a
party.
if
i
can
just
answer
one
question.
connick
is
focused
not
on
where
speech
happens,
as
respondent
insists,
but
rather
where
its
effects
occur.
as
this
court
held
in
the
city
of
san
diego
v.
roe,
employee
speech
completely
outside
of
the
workplace
raises
the
same
kind
of
concerns.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
petitioners
will
rest
on
their
submissions.
