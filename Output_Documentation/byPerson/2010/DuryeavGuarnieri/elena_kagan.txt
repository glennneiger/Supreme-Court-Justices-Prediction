justice
elena
kagan
mr.
ortiz,
can
i
try
a
hypothetical
on
you?
suppose
that
there
is
a
city
employee
and
unrelated
to
the
fact
that
he
is
a
city
employee
the
government
takes
some
part
of
his
property
without
just
compensation.
and
he
sues
the
government,
and
the
government
says,
somebody
says,
his
employer,
that
his
supervisor
said:
do
you
know
what
he's
just
done?
he's
just
sued
the
city;
i
think
we
should
fire
him.
and
he
brings
a
retaliation
claim.
is
that
protected
under
the
petition
clause?
justice
elena
kagan
really?
what
has
he
done
that's
protected
under
the
free
speech
clause?
he
has
brought
a
suit
saying:
i'm
entitled
to
just
compensation.
it
seems
to
me
--
the
reason
i
ask
is
because
this
seems
to
me
a
purely
private
matter
which
would
not
get
protection
under
your
test.
justice
elena
kagan
i
see,
so
that
goes
back
to
justice
scalia's
difference
test,
which
is
it's
not
a
matter
of
public
concern
versus
private
concern,
but
it's
a
matter
of
employment-related
versus
not
employment-related,
correct?
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
palmore
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
suppose
a
state
legislature
passes
a
law
depriving
all
state
employees
of
collective
bargaining
rights,
and
a
state
employee
files
a
lawsuit
saying
that
this
law
violates
the
state
constitution,
and
the
state
employee
is
thereupon
fired.
is
that
a
matter
of
public
concern
or
not?
justice
elena
kagan
and
suppose
--
now
going
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
example,
suppose
that
there
were
a
--
a
class
action
alleging
systemic
discrimination
in
some
governmental
workplace.
would
that
be
a
matter
of
public
concern?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
palmore,
on
that
matter,
one
last
hypothetical.
suppose
the
new
york
city
council
passed
a
resolution
that
said
a
precinct
house
would
be
closed
all
night
long
from
7
p.m.
to
7
a.m.,
and
the
chief
of
--
of
that
precinct
filed
suit
saying
that
this
was
micromanagement
and
it
was
going
to
affect
the
public
safety
of
the
citizenry,
and
then
that
chief
of
police
was
fired.
is
that
a
matter
of
public
concern?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
schnapper,
can
i
ask
justice
kennedy's
question
in
maybe
a
little
bit
of
a
different
way?
in
--
in
the
connick
inquiry,
you
have
a
threshold
inquiry
and
then
you
have
a
balancing
test.
now,
you're
suggesting
that
the
threshold
inquiry,
the
public
concern
inquiry,
is
kind
of
apples
and
oranges
here;
it's
just
not
appropriate
for
the
petition
clause.
but
the
question
that
then
follows
is,
should
there
be
a
replacement
threshold
inquiry
before
you
get
to
the
balancing
that
connick
suggests
is
the
second
stage
of
the
process?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
schnapper,
isn't
the
real
question
in
these
cases
whether
the
employee
is
acting
as
a
citizen
or
instead
whether
the
employee
is
acting
as
an
employee?
and
in
the
speech
cases,
that
distinction
suggests
a
public
concern
threshold
inquiry.
maybe
in
the
petition
cases
it
suggests
something
else,
but
that
that's
really
the
question
we
should
be
asking
is,
is
this
employee
acting
as
an
employee
or
as
a
citizen?
