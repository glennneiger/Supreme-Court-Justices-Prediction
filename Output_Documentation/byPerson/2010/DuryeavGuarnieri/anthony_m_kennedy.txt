do
you
--
can
you
think
of
any
instance
where
speech
by
the
employee
would
not
be
protected
under
the
pickering-connick
free
speech
calculus
but
would
be
protected
under
the
petition
clause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
--
under
the
first
amendment
speech
clause--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
have
said
that
an
employee's,
public
employee's,
right
to
speech
can
be
regulated,
can
be
confined,
can
be
restricted
beyond
what
the
state
could
do
for
a
nonemployee.
are
you
saying
that
if
--
if
the
petition
clause
is
involved
there
is
no
right
to
restrict
what
the
--
employer
does?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
you
have
to
offer
a
test
and
you
don't
want
the
public
concern
test,
so
what's
your
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
would
be
content
to
apply
that
analytic,
broad
analytic
framework
to
the
petition
clause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
garcetti
case,
the
district
attorney
was
disciplined
for
sending
a
memo
because
he
disagreed
with
how
the
trial
strategy
was
supposed
to
unfold,
and
then
he
actually
made
that
argument
in
court
and
was
disciplined
for
that.
would
he
have
been
protected
if
he
had
just
gone
to
court
to
sue
the
office
of
the
district
attorney
on
some
sort
of
a
prospective
injunction
saying,
with
reference
to
all
search
warrants
you
should
follow
the
following
procedures?
would
that
have
been
protected,
even
though
the
memo
was
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
have
objected
if
the
same
analysis
were
used
in
the
petition
clause
case
as
in
the
actual
case?
just
take
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just
white
out
"speech
clause"
and
put
in
"petition
clause"
and
file
the
same
opinion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
to
know
how
the
analytic
framework
differs.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
the
expert
in
this
area,
but
that
--
that
surprises
me.
i
thought
it
was
quite
common
in
the
early
1800s
for
you
to
go
to
all
your
neighbors
--
and
the
book
"quarreling
about
slavery"
explains
this,
where
there
were
petitions
signed
by
many
of
the
constituents
in
the
congressman's
district.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there
were
scores,
scores
of
--
of
signatures
on
these
petitions.
so
that's
like
your
card
table.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
the
calhoun
position,
not
the
john
q.
adams
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
concerns
the
extent
of
protection
that
the
petition
clause
of
the
first
amendment
grants
to
public
employees
when
they
have
a
routine
dispute
with
their
government
employer.
petitions
are
a
form
of
expression.government
employees
who
invoked
the
petition
clause
in
most
cases
could
also
invoke
the
speech
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
now
in
the
speech
clause
case,
to
show
that
the
employer
interfered
with
protected
rights,
the
employee,
as
a
general
rule,
must
show
that
his
or
her
speech
was
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
here,
the
issue
is
whether
that
test
applies
when
the
employee
invokes
the
petition
clause.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
held
but
the
public
concern
test
does
not
apply
in
those
instances.
charles
guarnieri,
the
respondent
here,
filed
a
union
grievance
challenging
his
termination
as
chief
of
police
for
the
borough
of
duryea,
the
town
of
about
4,600
persons
in
northeastern
pennsylvania.
an
arbitrator
ordered
the
respondent
reinstated.
upon
his
return,
the
counsel
issued
11
directives
instructing
him
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
for
instance,
one
directive
stated
that
the
municipal
building
is
a
smoke-free
building
and
that
the
police
department
is
not
exempt.
respondent
filed
this
lawsuit
against
the
borough
and
borough
counsel
and
individual
members
of
the
counsel
under
42
u.s.c.
1983,
he
claimed
that
his
grievance
was
a
petition
protected
by
the
petition
clause
and
he
alleged
that
the
directives
were
unlawful
retaliation.
and
after
the
suit
was
filed,
the
counsel
denied
a
request
by
respondent
for
overtime.
he
amended
the
complaint
to
allege
that
his
1983
lawsuit
was
a
petition
and
that
the
denial
of
overtime
also
constituted
retaliation
for
his
having
filed
the
lawsuit.
the
jury
found
in
favor
of
respondent,
defendants
appealed
on
the
ground
that
respondent's
grievances
and
lawsuit
did
not
address
matters
of
public
concern,
but
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
argument
and
it
affirmed.
this
court
now
concludes
that
the
judgment
must
be
reversed.
the
public
concern
test
developed
in
speech
clause
cases,
reconciles
the
employee's
first
amendment
right
and
the
government
employer's
legitimate
interest
in
performing
this
mission.
the
government
has
a
substantial
interest
in
ensuring
that
all
of
these
operations
are
efficient
and
effective,
the
government
interest
that
justify
a
cautious
in
restraining
approach
under
the
speech
clause
or
justice
relevant
under
the
petition
clause.
petitions
no
less
than
speech
can
interfere
with
the
effective
and
efficient
operation
of
government.
adoption
of
a
different
rule
for
petition
clause
claims
would
provide
a
ready
means
for
public
employees
to
circumvent
the
protections
of
the
public
concern
test.
now,
the
petition
clause
undoubtedly
does
apply
in
the
context
of
a
personal
grievance.
petitions
to
the
government,
nonetheless,
assumed
an
added
dimension
when
they
seek
to
advance
political,
social
or
other
ideas
of
interest
to
the
community
as
a
whole.
public
employees
are
members
of
the
community
most
likely
to
have
informed
and
definite
opinions
about
a
wide
range
of
matters
related
directly
or
indirectly
to
their
employment.just
as
the
public
has
the
right
to
hear
the
views
of
public
employees,
the
public
has
the
right
to
the
benefit
of
employees
for
participation
in
petitioning
activity.
the
framework
used
to
govern
speech
clause
claims
by
public
employees
when
applied
to
the
petition
clause
will
protect
both
the
interest
of
the
government
and
the
first
amendment
right.
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
apply
this
framework,
there
has
been
no
determination
as
to
how
it
would
apply
in
the
context
of
this
case.
this
court
need
not
consider
that
question
in
the
first
instance
rather
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.

judgment.
