mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
asking
this
court
to
cabin
connick
v.
myers'
public
concern
requirement,
respondent
would
constitutionalize,
under
the
petition
clause,
large
parts
of
the
law
of
public
employee
discipline,
and
thereby
grant
to
public
employees
a
broad
constitutional
employment
right
that
private
employees
do
not
enjoy.
two
independent
reasons,
however,
argue
strongly
for
applying
the
public
concern
requirement
to
discipline
claims
brought
both
under
the
free
speech
and
the
petition
clauses.
first,
the
constitutional
framework
principles
this
court
has
repeatedly
identified
in
its
public
employment
cases
argue
strongly
for
requiring
it.
and
second,
mcdonald
v.
smith's
principle
of
parity
argues
strongly
for
creating
no
hierarchy
between
the
free
speech
and
petition
clauses.
when--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--your
honor,
we
agree
that
the
petition
clause
--
that
when
the
petition
clause
and
the
free
speech
clause
cover
the
same
activity,
they
apply
--
they
cover
it
under
mcdonald
in
the
same
way.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
one
part
of
that
inquiry
turns
on
the
content.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
part
of
the
inquiry,
yes,
your
honor,
should
turn
on
the
content.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
the--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--your
honor,
this
--
under
the
constitutional
background
principles
this
court
has
developed,
this
court
should
look
at
--
looks
at
how
close
to
the
core
a
particular
example
of
employee
activity
is,
and
then
talks
about
how
much
of
a
burden
that
kind
of
activity
poses
to
the
efficient
operation
of
the
workplace.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
that
is
right,
your
honor,
just
as
most
examples
of
speech
concern
private
matters,
too.
yet
that
does
not
define
the
core
of
the
free
speech
clause.
there's
not
an
empirical
inquiry.
that
depends
upon
the
purpose
of
the
clause.
and
as
this
court
stated
very
definitely
in
mcdonald,
the
core
of
the
petition
clause,
like
the
free
speech
clause,
was
--
was
aimed
at
promoting
democratic
self-government.
petitioning
is
a
particular
form
of
speech.
it
is
speech
directed
to
a
particular
audience,
the
government,
some
arm
of
government,
some
individual
in
government,
and
it
is
speech
that
has
a
particular
purpose:
asking
for
a
change
of
some
sort
in
government
policy.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
your
honor,
in
practice,
that
inquiry
would
not
align
much
differently
than
the
connick
inquiry.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
and
in
this
particular
case,
designing
a
kind
of
threshold
inquiry
along
those
lines
would
actually
advantage
petitioners.
one
difficulty
in
application,
though,
is
that
this
court
has
always
identified
the
purpose
of
the
connick
threshold
test
as
categoricalizing
in
a
way
the
pickering
balancing
inquiry.
and
if
you
had
a
threshold
test
that
basically
did
not
match,
was
a
little
oblique
to
the
pickering
balancing
inquiry,
it
would
create
much
more
work
for
the
lower
courts
along
the
way.
or
perhaps
this
court
would
want
to
change
the
pickering
balancing
inquiry.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
they
might
well,
your
honor.
if
the
pickering
balancing
inquiry
still
aligns
with
the
traditional
framework
that
this
court
has
described
in
its
employment
cases,
what
i
describe,
and
this
other
inquiry,
which
you're
suggesting,
justice
scalia,
was
somewhat
oblique
to
it,
then
it
might
conceivably
be
necessary
to
do
both.
one--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--well,
your
honor,
then
that
might
argue
for
more
reengineering
of
the
rest
of
the
--
the
enterprise
as
well,
a
step
that
this
court
has
not
identified
as
appropriate
under--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--well,
your
honor,
if
at
the
first
stage
the
court
is
running
an
inquiry
that
is
something
different
from
connick,
that
is
not
going
to
map
onto
traditional
pickering
balancing,
at
least
as
this
court
has
described
it,
at
the
second
stage.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
because,
your
honor,
pickering
balancing
has
gone
to
things
like
how
--
how
--
how
important
that
particular
example
of
speech
is,
how
close
it
is
to
the
core
of
what
the
first
amendment
protects,
and
then
that
is
weighed
against
the
kind
of
burden
it
would
place
on
the
government
to
have
that
activity
protected
in
a
very
strong
way.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
your
honor,
if
this
--
if
this
court
were
to
proceed
down
that
road,
petitioners,
i
believe,
would
still
end
up
victorious.
this
is
a
case,
as
i
understand
your
--
your
approach,
where
the
petition
does
concern
purely
employment
matters.
it
is
not
a
petition
aimed
at
or
directed
at
the
government
in
its
capacity
as
sovereign,
so
under
that
kind
of
analysis,
that
is
where
the
initial
trigger,
this
case,
would
have
not
been
constitutionalized.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
it
would
depend
upon
the
particular
claims
involved,
or
statements
in
the
petition.
if
it
were
a
statement
that
there
was
a
policy,
involved
a
petition
against
a
policy
in
a
government
department
involving
race,
that
would
certainly
qualify.
that
would
be
like
the
gibbons
case
under
the
free
speech
clause,
your
honor.
if,
however,
it
were
a
one-off
allegation
that
a
particular,
say,
low-level
governmental
supervisor
had
engaged
in
a
form
of
discriminatory
activity--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--your
honor,
a
petition
to
the
employer
about
changing
the
hours
of
employment--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--for
overtime--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--the
flip.
a
petition,
a
complaint
to
an
employer
about
the
employer's
pervasive
or
apparently
pervasive
policies
in
violation
of
the
law,
would
certainly
qualify
as
something
to
--
a
petition
to
the
sovereign.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
for
sure.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
you
certainly
do,
your
honor,
and
presumably
this
court
would
look
at
some
of
the
same
factors
involved
there:
the
form,
the
content,
and
the
context
of
the
communication.
all
of
those
things
are
relevant.
this
court
has
admitted
that
that
inquiry
is
sometimes
messy,
that
there
are
some
--
many
cases
where
the
line
of
distinction
is
not
clear.
but
it
is
--
this
court
has
not
hesitated
to
apply
that
test
because
of
its
importance
to
the
public
employment
environment.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
a
lawsuit,
pursuing
a
lawsuit,
is
definitely
a
form
of
petitioning
activity,
your
honor.
petitioners
do
not
contest
that.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
case.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
it
would
qualify
under
the
original
conception
of
what
a
petition
is
all
about
that
was
in
this
case.
it
is
petitioner's
view
that
it
would
not
qualify
under
the
access
to
courts
definition
or
conception
of
petition
that
respondent
has
developed
since
the
case
was
first
before
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
your
honor,
that
might
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
due
process
clause
has
been
interpreted
more
robustly
and
supplies
a
certain
floor
of
constitutional
protection
for
lawsuits.
and
the
petition
clause,
since
it
is
directed
at
petitions
generally
and
in
particular
the
framers,
the
evidence
is,
had
in
mind
not
petitions
to
the
courts,
but
petitions
to
the
legislature,
if
lawsuits--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--the
evidence
is
that
developed
by
professor
andrews,
and
the
argument
is
a
somewhat
slender
one
that
goes
as
follows:
at
the
time
of
founding,
congress
was
the
central
sort
of
clearinghouse
for
petitions
and
handled
both
what
we
think
of
as
the
stereotypical
paradigmatic
petitions,
pleas
to
congress
to
sort
of
change
the
law,
and
also
handled
a
lot
of
private
bills.
over
time,
congress
handed
over
much
of
the
responsibility
for
handling
the
things
that
came
through
private
bills
to
the
courts,
and
so
to
the
extent
--
this
is
respondent's
argument
--
that
the
courts
handled,
took
over
those
things,
the
lawsuits
are
protected.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
no,
your
honor.
in
the
district
court
it
was
conceded
that
the
grievance
activity
would
be
--
was
protected.
however,
petitioners
do
contest
quite
sharply
that
under
respondent's
new
view
of
the
petition
clause
that
the
things
of
central
importance
are
lawsuits
and
other
communications
that
would
be
protected,
perhaps
be
protected,
otherwise
under
the
access
to
courts
doctrine,
that
arbitration,
the
arbitration
involved
in
this
case,
does
not
count
and
should
not
receive
any
kind
of
heightened
protection.
the
problem,
much
of
the
problem
here,
is
the
theory
of
what
is
a
petition
from
respondent's
side
has
changed
from
the
district
court
to
this
court.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be
protected
for
two
different
reasons.
first,
that
would
--
similar
activity
would
be
protected
under
the
free
speech
clause,
so
that
would
preserve
the
principle
of
parity.
second--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--it's
not
employment-related
or
related
to
his
particular
job,
and
this
court
has
always
drawn
the
distinction
there.
for
example,
in
national
treasury
employees
union
this
court
applied
that
kind
of
analysis.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
that
shows
how
closely
those
two
things
have
been
related
in
this
court's
approach.
in
--
but
certainly
something
that
is
privately-related,
a
public
employee
is
complaining
about
tax
assessment
or
something
like
that
and
tries
to
sue
for
retaliation
under,
under
that
theory,
not
for
anything
related
to
his
or
her
job,
this
court
--
under
this
court's
and
the
lower
court's
application
of
the
connick
principles,
there
would
be
no
problem
there
treating
it
as
speech
or
as
a
petition.
so
it
is
only
when
the
lawsuit
or
the
petition
involves
something
related
to
the
person's
employment
that
these
particular
--
this
particular
test
would
kick
in.
and
that's
consistent,
your
honor,
with
this
court's
twin
background
constitutional
framework
principles,
one
that
you
look
at
how
much
disruption
something
is
likely
to
pose
to
the
workforce
and
how
central
it
is
to
the
particular
constitutional
provision
involved.
in
this
case,
if
in
general
it's
not
employment-related
the
government
has
much
less
interest
in
worrying
over
it
this
way
and
applying
the
connick
threshold
test
is
much
less
justified.
you
would
have
to
do
pickering
balancing,
proceed
directly
to
pickering
balancing
in
that
case.
now,
your
honor,
respondent's
view
presents
several
problems
of
sort
of
practical
application,
or
would,
to
this
court.
first,
it
would
allow
for
the
easy
circumvention
of
connick,
which
is
a
test
that
on
the
free
speech
side
this
court
has
long
held
is
very
important
for
the
public
employment
field
to
work
efficiently.
it
would
be
very
easy
for
a
particular
employee
to
take
activity
that
connick
would
not
allow
to
proceed,
to
turn
into
a
lawsuit
on
the
free
speech
clause,
and
just
by
rephrasing
it,
respinning
it,
whatever,
to
turn
it
into
a
petition
where
under
respondent's
rule
the
result
would
be
very
different.
it
also
would
require
the
court
to
create
a
hierarchy
between
speech
claims
and
petition
claims,
and,
more
importantly,
if
the
court
were
to
go
down
the
particular
road
that
respondent
describes
and
see
the
center
of
the
petition
clause
as
defined
by
the
access
to
courts
doctrine
it
would
create
a
hierarchy
among
different
forms
of
petition.
all
of
a
sudden,
petitions
that
at
the
founding
were
thought
to
be
at
the
periphery,
if
there,
of
the
petition
clause
would
define
its
center,
and
a
paradigmatic
petition
of
a
letter
to
congress
asking
it
to
change
its
position
on
something
would
not
be
covered
at
all.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
retain
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
