you
--
do
you
think--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--suppose
the
borough
here
bought
something
from
a
company
under
a
contract
that
included
an
arbitration
clause.
would
that,
would
the
right
of
the
company
to
engage
in
arbitration
be
protected
by
the
petition
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
a
number
of
municipal
employees
prepare
a
formal
document
called
"petition",
and
they
say:
we
have
a
grievance,
and
our
grievance
is
that
the
quality
of
the
food
in
the
cafeteria
is
poor?
now,
is
that
protected
by
the
petition
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
does
that
rule
come
from?
it's
drawn
out
of
thin
air?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
submission
is
there
are
not
very
many
--
throughout
the
whole
country
there
are
very
few
frivolous
1983
cases
or
employment
cases,
that's
your
point?
