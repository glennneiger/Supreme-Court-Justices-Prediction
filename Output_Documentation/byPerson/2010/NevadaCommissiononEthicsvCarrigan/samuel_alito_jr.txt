justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
found
this
statute
very
difficult
to
understand,
but
maybe
you
can
explain
what's
--
what
i
found
a
bit
puzzling.
the
statute
talks
about
a
commitment
in
a
private
capacity
to
the
interests
of
others.
now,
i
take
it
that
that
commitment
doesn't
have
to
be
something
contractual.
when
you're
talking
about
relatives,
that
would
assume
--
that
that
would
include
emotional
commitments
to
the
relatives
who
are
listed;
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
not
--
not
a
financial
interest
of
the
public
official,
a
financial
interest
of
the
--
the
relative
or
the
person
who
is
substantially
similar
to
a
relative.
or
is
that
wrong?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
maybe
if
i
give
you
an
example
it
will
be
clearer.
let's
take
somebody
who
is
within
the
third
degree
of
consanguinity.
so
that
would
include
second
cousins?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
now,
let's
say
a
public
officer
is
considering
something
that
would
affect
everybody's
property
taxes
in
town
or
a
measure
that
would
affect
the
benefits
or
the
wages
of
everybody
who
works
for
the
town.
and
this
official
has
a
second
cousin
whose
property
taxes
would
be
affected
or
works
for
the
town,
and
the
second
cousin's
wages
or
benefits
would
be
affected.
now,
would
that
person
have
to
recuse?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
i
were
a
public
officer
i
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
figure
out
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
think
that
an
effect
on
my
second
cousin's
property
taxes
would
require
--
would
materially
affect
my
judgment.
but
it's
even
worse
than
that
because
of
the
"substantially
similar".
so
the
public
officer
not
only
has
to
think
about
second
cousins;
the
person
has
to
think
about
everybody
who
is
like
a
second
cousin
to
him
or
her.
i
have
no
idea
how
you
--
how
you
go
about
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
statute
doesn't
apply
just
to
voting.
it
says
that
the
public
officer
shall
not
vote
upon
or
advocate
the
passage
or
failure
of
the
message.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
advocating
the
passage
or
failure
of
the
message
is
surely
speech
in
the
ordinary
understanding
of
the
concept.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
several
recent
cases
the
court
has
taken
pains
to
make
the
point
that
it
is
not
going
to
recognize
any
new
categories
of
unprotected
speech.
but
the
argument
that
you
seem
to
be
endorsing
now
in
response
to
some
questions
is
that
there
is
this
new
category
of
unprotected
speech,
which
is
advocacy
of
the
passage
of
legislation
when
a
recusal
statute
comes
into
play.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
the
rules
of
civility
in
the
houses
of
congress?
there
are
things
that
a
member
of
the
senate,
for
example,
cannot
say
about
another
senator,
or
make
a
personal
attack.
that
would
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
if
the
senator
stepped
outside
the
door.
are
those
--
is
there
first
amendment
protection
for
that?
do
they
have
--
do
those
rules
have
to
pass
first
amendment
scrutiny?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
they
based
their
decision
solely
on
the
--
on
the
fact
that
vasquez
had
been
the
campaign
manager
in
the
past
and
he
was
a
great
campaign
manager,
and
perhaps
carrigan
would
like
him
to
be
his
campaign
manager
in
the
future,
would
there
be
a
problem
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
somebody
had
made
extensive
independent
expenditures
in
support
of
the
--
the
public
officer's
prior
campaign,
and
the
public
officer
may
hope
that
they
--
similar
expenditures
will
be
made
in
the
future.
would
that
be
a
basis?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
not?
