justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
elwood,
for
me
at
least
we've
--
we've
jumped
way
ahead.
i'm
not
so
much
concerned
about
the
vagueness
as
i
am
about
the
proposition
that
ethical
rules
adopted
by
legislatures
for
voting
are
subject
to
review
by
this
court
or
by
any
court
under
the
first
amendment.
this
is
the
first
case
i'm
aware
of
that
we've
ever
had
which
makes
such
an
allegation
or
--
i'm
not
even
aware
of
any
other
case
in
220
years
in
federal
courts.
and
it's
certainly
not
because
legislative
rules
have
not
been
vague.
the
first
congress
adopted
a
rule
that,
quote,
"no
member
shall
vote
on
any
question
in
the
event
of
which
he
is
immediately
and
particularly
interested.
"
i
don't
consider
that
very
precise.
and
the
rules
adopted
by
thomas
jefferson
for
the
senate,
"where
the
private
interests
of
a
member
are
concerned
in
a
bill
or
question,
he
is
to
withdraw.
"
"the
private
interests",
what
does
that
mean?
"and
where
such
an
interest
has
appeared,
his
voice
is
disallowed,
even
after
a
division.
"
now,
that's
been
around
in
our
congress
forever,
but
our
constitution
provides
that
--
that
the
rules
of
the
legislature
are
to
be
determined
by
congress
and
not
by
this
court,
and
i
am
sure
we
would
not,
we
would
not
review
those
rules.
now,
is
there
a
contradiction
between
leaving
those
rules
to
congress
and
the
first
amendment?
do
you
really
think
that
--
that
the
two
are
set
in
opposition
to
each
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
ending
up
skirmishing
on
what
seems
to
me
a
less
significant
aspect
of
this
case.
this
case
is
enormously
important
on
that
major
question.
i'm
not
inclined
to
resolve
it
on
the
question,
well,
you
know,
this
is
too
vague.
mean,
it's
even
vaguer
than
what
the
first
congress
adopted.
it
seems
to
me
that
just
opens,
opens
the
door
to
future
litigation
challenging
ethical
rules,
which
--
which
does
not
make
me
happy.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
if
they
did
we
would
review
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
nice.
but
the
cases
come
up
here
anyway,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
look,
fighting
words
are
words.
they
are
speech.
there's
no
doubt
that
they're
speech.
and
it's
a
considerable
question
whether
the
vote
of
a
legislature
is
speech
for
purposes
of
the
first
--
is
speech
at
all,
not
whether
it's
a
fighting
speech
or
something
else,
whether
it's
speech.
it's
a
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
may
be
willing
to,
but
i'm
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
elwood,
why
is
that
extraordinary?
why
aren't
you
willing
to
accept
that?
i
mean,
if
--
if
the
speaker
of
the
house
counts
the
votes
wrong
and
he
says
the
ayes
have
it
when
it's
obvious
that
the
ayes
don't
have
it,
do
we
review
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
greater
violation
of
the
principles
of
democracy
than
counting
the
votes
wrong
in
the
legislature?
yet
that
matter
is
not
reviewable
here,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
is
it
extraordinary
that
this
one
should
not
be
reviewable?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
carrigan
--
if
--
if
we
did
not
review
any
of
these
ethical
rules
applicable
to
a
legislature,
at
least
where
the
rule
is
adopted
by
the
legislative
body
itself,
as
--
as
opposed
to
being
imposed
upon
it
by
--
by
some
other
body,
there
is
the
protection
that
all
of
the
legislators
are
subject
to
it.
so
if
it's
vague
for
mr.
carrigan
in
this
case,
it's
vague
for
everybody
else
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
it's
sort
of
a
self-regulating
mechanism.
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
to
be
willing
to
abide
by
whatever
--
whatever
vagueness
and
whatever
ethical
rules
you
--
you
have
opposed
--
imposed
on
somebody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
does
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rosenkranz,
is
--
is
the
vote
of
a
judge
in
a
case
like
the
vote
of
a
legislator?
is
--
is
that
speech?
because
judges
are
subject
to
ethical
rules
which
--
which
prohibit
their
participating
if
there
would
be,
quote,
"an
appearance
of
impropriety".
if
there's
anything
vaguer
than
that
i
can't
imagine
what
it
might
be.
can
i
get
out
of
all
that
stuff?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
answering
my
question?
i
want
to
know
whether
i
can
get
out
of
this
appearance
of
impropriety
stuff.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
whether
the
first
amendment
applies,
with
all
of
its
prohibitions
against
vagueness?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
too
bad,
because
i
would
have
been
much
more
attracted
to
your
position.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
rather
exaggerated.
i
mean,
you
have
to
worry
he's
going
to
buy
a
casino
or
--
or
something
like
that?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
that's
what
it
means,
you
would
think
the
legislature
would
change
it,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
doesn't
just
hurt
mr.
carrigan.
that
--
you
know,
that
--
that
would
be
something
every
legislator
would
--
would
worry
about
and
say,
oh,
boy,
we've
got
to
change
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
don't
we
let
them
change
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
nevada.
nevada's
ethics
in
government
law
prohibits
public
officers
from
voting
on
or
speaking
for
or
against
the
adoption
of
any
matter
in
which
the
independence
of
a
reasonable
person
in
their
situation
might
be
compromised
by,
among
other
things,
"a
commitment
in
a
private
capacity
to
the
interests
of
others".
in
2005,
the
nevada
commission
on
ethics
initiated
an
investigation
of
respondent
michael
carrigan,
an
elected
member
of
the
city
council
of
sparks,
nevada.
complaints
had
accused
carrigan
of
violating
the
ethics
law
by
voting
to
approve
a
hotel/casino
project
by
a
company
for
which
a
long-time
friend
and
campaign
manager
of
his
was
a
paid
consultant.
the
commission
concluded
that
carrigan
should've
recused
himself.
it
censured
carrigan,
but
declined
to
impose
any
other
sanctions
because
the
violation
was
not
willful.
carrigan
filed
a
petition
for
judicial
review,
arguing
that
the
provisions
of
the
ethics
law
that
he
was
found
to
have
violated,
were
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment.
the
nevada
district
court
denied
his
petition
but
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
reversed.
that
court
held
that
voting
by
a
public
officer
is
protected
by
the
--
by
--
is
protected
first
amendment
speech
and
that
the
ethics
in
government
law
was
unconstitutionally
overbroad.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
nevada.
as
this
court
said
in
republican
party
of
minnesota
versus
white,
"a
universal
and
long-established
tradition
of
prohibiting
certain
conduct
creates
a
strong
presumption
that
the
prohibition
is
constitutional."
our
history
of
limiting
legislators'
ability
to
participate
in
matters
in
which
they
have
a
conflict
does
suggest
that
the
first
amendment
has
no
application
to
voting
by
legislatives.
in
its
very
first
session,
for
example,
the
house
of
representatives
adopted
a
rule
stating
that
"no
member
shall
vote
on
any
question,
in
the
event
of
which
he
is
immediately
and
particularly
interested."
thomas
jefferson,
when
he
was
vice
president
of
the
united
states
and
thus
president
of
the
senate,
adopted
a
similar
rule
for
that
house
in
1801.
conflict
of
interest
rules
for
federal
judges
also
date
back
to
the
founding
and
the
states
have
a
similarly
long
tradition
of
such
rules.
carrigan
argues
that
voting
must
be
protected
speech
because
there
are
many
"tales
of
legislators
using
their
votes
to
express
deeply
held
and
highly
unpopular
views".
when
a
legislator
votes,
however,
he
does
so
not
as
an
individual
but
as
a
political
representative
engaged
in
the
legislative
process.
acting
in
that
capacity,
his
vote
is
not
his
own
speech
but
a
mechanical
function
of
government.
the
commitment
of
his
appointed
chair
of
the
legislature's
power
to
the
passage
or
defeat
of
a
particular
proposal.
moreover,
voting
is
not
symbolic
action
as
his,
for
example,
the
burning
of
a
flag.
and
the
fact
that
a
vote
is
the
product
of
a
deeply
held
or
highly
unpopular
personal
belief
does
not
transform
it
into
first
amendment
speech.
even
if
the
mere
vote
itself
could
somehow
express
depth
of
belief,
which
we
think
it
cannot.
this
court
has
rejected
the
notion
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
use
the
mechanisms
of
government
to
convey
a
message.
for
example,
in
the
case
called
"timmons
versus
twin
cities
area
new
party",
we
upheld
a
state
election
law
that
prohibited
fusion
candidates,
that
is
candidates
who
appear
on
the
ballot
as
the
choice
of
multiple
parties.
we
said
that
a
party
was
entirely
free
to
endorse
the
candidate
of
another
party
but
had
no
right
to
use
the
state
printed
ballot
in
a
state
election
to
express
that
endorsement.
our
decision
in
doe
versus
reed
moreover,
another
earlier
case
is
not
to
the
contrary.
in
that
case,
we
held
that
a
citizen's
signing
of
a
petition
was
not
deprived
of
its
status
as
protected
speech
simply
because,
under
the
relevant
state
law,
if
the
petition
garnered
enough
signatures,
it
would
stay
the
effect
of
the
states
statute
to
which
it
pertained
pending
a
required
referendum.
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
an
inherently
expressive
act,
a
citizen's
private
act
of
joining
a
petition
in
his
capacity
as
a
citizen,
remains
an
expressive
act
despite
having
legislative
effect.
it
is
altogether
another
thing
to
say
that
performing
a
governmental
function
becomes
an
expressive
act
simply
because
the
governmental
actor
wishes
it
to
be
so.
i
should
mention
one
other
point.
you
will
recall
that
the
nevada
law,
not
only
for
bad
voting
by
the
legislature
with
a
con
--
by
the
legislature
with
a
conflict
but
also
forbade
his
speaking
in
the
session
for
or
against
the
proposition.
if
it
is,
as
we
have
said,
constitutional
to
prohibit
his
voting,
prohibiting
his
speaking
in
the
run-up
to
the
vote,
qualifies
as
what
our
cases
call
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restriction
on
speech.
it
is
reasonable
to
restrict
legislative
debate
to
those
who
have
a
right
to
vote.
carrigan
puts
forth
--
forward
two
other
reasons
why
in
his
view
nevada's
recusal
statute
is
unconstitutional
including
the
fact
that
it
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
but
since
neither
of
those
reasons
was
passed
upon
by
the
nevada
supreme
court
or
mentioned
in
carri
--
carrigan's
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
we
decline
to
reach
them.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
and
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
in
the
judgment.
