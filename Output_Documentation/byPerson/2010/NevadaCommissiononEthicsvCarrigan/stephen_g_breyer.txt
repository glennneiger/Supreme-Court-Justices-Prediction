justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
agree
with
justice
scalia?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
statute
says
"or
advocate
the
passage
of".
so
i
guess
that's
speech.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
--
i
mean,
the
basic
question
is,
again,
do
you
agree
with
justice
scalia's
question,
the
import
of
it;
or
don't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
doesn't
apply,
if
voting
is
not
speech,
then
no
matter
how
outrageous
the
law
or
rule,
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
first
amendment;
and
if
it
is
speech,
then
you
get
into
some
of
the
questions
that
were
raised,
is
this
too
vague
or
is
it
not?
so
which
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
might
have
to
write
an
opinion,
irrespective--
[laughter]
--which
says--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--either
it
is
speech
or
not,
and
so
that's
why
we're
asking
the
question,
to
get
your
opinion--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
is
an
informed
opinion,
about
how
we
should
write
that
paragraph.
do
we
say
that
voting
is
within
the
first
amendment
scope
or
do
we
say
it
is
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
that
case,
the
most
outrageous
law
you
can
think
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
respect
of
voting
is
not
covered
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
asking
for
willing
to
do--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
--
i
mean,
what
the
commission
says
is
mr.
vasquez
has
been
a
close
personal
friend,
confidante,
and
political
advisor
throughout
the
years.
so
that
doesn't
sound
like
any
volunteer.
it
sounds
like
somebody
sitting
on
a
case
where
his
best
friend
is
likely
to
gain
millions
of
dollars.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
it
seems
when
i
read
that
opinion,
that
they're
thinking
all
these
things
combined
is
what
causes
this
to
fall
within
the
category
of
a
reasonable
person
might
have
doubts
about
the
independence
of
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
part
of
it.
but
my
--
my
basic
question
is,
as
you
know,
with
judges,
and
i
guess
you
have
a
very
vague
statute
which
was
quoted
to
you,
and
what
we
have
are
subsidiary
rules
with
ethics
commissioners.
i
have
in
my
office--
they're
not
commissioners;
they're
committees
of
judges.
and
i
have
in
my
office
seven
volumes
which
i
look
at
when
there's
a
question,
as
others
do,
and
those
seven
volumes
contain
dozens
of
opinions
of
a
committee
trying
to
apply
vague
statutes
and
vague
rules
--
not
constitutionally
vague,
but
generally.
so
what's
wrong
with
nevada
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
so
you're
saying
that
the
difference
is
that
we're
judges?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
congress
and
legislators
and
executive
branch
people
couldn't
have
exactly
the
same
system?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
have
general
rules?
it's
called
the
common
law
system.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
didn't
answer
my
question,
which
is
since
the
judiciary
uses
what's
called
the
common
law
method,
why
is
it
impermissible
for
the
executive
branch
or
the
legislative
branch
also
to
use
a
common
law,
case-by-case
method
of
elucidating
through
example
what
a
general
--
what
a
general
provision
means?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
--
so
you're
saying
that
one
who
engages
has
to
use
a
--
a
definitive
rule-based
method
rather
than
a
common
law
method?
so
my
question
there
would
be,
assuming
your
difference
between
the
branches
is
right,
still
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
his
argument
is
--
i
don't
see
--
that
the
ethics
commission
at
least
in
part
relied
upon
the
fact
that
he
was
the
campaign
manager,
and
he
is
saying,
i
think,
as
i
understand
it,
or
at
least
i
have
this
question,
that
an
ethics
commission
cannot
disqualify
a
legislator
on
the
ground,
even
in
part,
that
an
individual
had
a
political
association
with
him
previously.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
may
be
a
new
argument
in
this
court,
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
a
new
argument
in
this
court,
as
i've
stated
it
to
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
made
that
argument
below?
