i'm
not
sure
why
you
should
concede
even
that,
mr.
elwood.
if
this
is
just
conduct,
if
this
is
not
proscribable
speech
of
the
kind
that
r.a.v.
was
talking
about,
why
should
we
care
about
the
viewpoint
based
doctrine
that's
arisen
in
first
amendment
law?
justice
elena
kagan
and
--
and
mr.
rosenkranz,
what
about
officials
in
the
executive
branch?
when
the
secretary
of
defense
gives
a
speech
and
the
president
doesn't
like
it
and
the
president
fires
the
secretary
of
defense,
does
the
secretary
of
defense
have
a
first
amendment
action?
justice
elena
kagan
so
all
the
official
acts
in
the
legislature,
in
the
executive
branch,
you're
somehow
saying
courts
are
different,
so
i
guess
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that,
but
official
acts
across
the
government
are
now
subject
to
first
amendment
analysis?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean,
this
rule
applies
to
everyone,
too.
it
might
apply
to
one
person
on
one
vote
and
to
another
person
on
another
vote,
but
everybody
at
every
vote
has
to
look
at
these
ethical
rules
and
decide
whether
they
have
to
recuse
themselves
as
a
result.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
do
you
think
that
if
there
were
a
statute
--
let's
take
out
the
vagueness
aspect
of
this.
if
there
were
a
statute
that
said
you
can't
vote
on
anything
where
you
have
yourself
some
monetary
gain
attached
to
it
or
if
a
very
close
family
member
or
if
a
close
business
associate
or
campaign
manager
of
your
campaign,
do
you
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
elena
kagan
because
the
--
the
state
--
what
the
state
thinks
is
that
a
campaign
manager
is
just
like
a
business
partner.
justice
elena
kagan
but
why
do
they
have
to
know
ex
ante?
there
was
an
advisory
process
that
was
set
up
by
the
nevada
commission
here.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
carrigan
chose
not
to
use
it.
but
he
could
have
gone
to
the
commission,
said:
what
do
you
think
about
this
relationship?
does
it
fit
or
does
it
not
fit?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that,
mr.
rosenkranz.
there
are
many
laws
out
there
that
say
people
who
serve
in
certain
government
capacities,
when
they
leave
those
jobs,
can't
lobby
for
a
certain
number
of
years.
how
is
that
any
different?
