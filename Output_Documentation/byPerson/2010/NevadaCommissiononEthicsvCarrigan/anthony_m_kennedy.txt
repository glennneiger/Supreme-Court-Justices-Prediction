justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
--
the
case
is
--
is
presented
to
us
with
briefs
that
seem
to
pass
in
the
night.
your
emphasis
was
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
right
to
vote
that's
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
and
--
which
is
what
the
nevada
court
held
and
you're
quite
correct
to
address
it.
but
the
respondent
says:
well,
this
interest
has
a
chilling
effect
on
--
on
protected
speech.
i
think
we
have
to
reach
both
parts
of
that
argument.
do
you
--
do
you
agree
with
me?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
--
if
we
say
that
intermediate
scrutiny
is
the
test,
even
under
that
test,
certainly
under
that
test,
the
regulation
cannot
chill
speech
any
more
than
necessary
to
fulfill
the
governmental
interests,
even
under
the
intermediate
standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
it
just
seems
to
me
it's
difficult
for
it
to
just
address
the
standard
of
proof
without
deciding
the
case.
maybe
you're
right.
maybe
we
can
just
answer
the
--
the
question
that
was
certified
and
--
and
send
it
back,
if
--
if
you
prevail.
i'm
not
sure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
--
the
objection
to
the
statute
on
the
grounds
that
it's
vague
doesn't
go
away
simply
because
intermediate
scrutiny
applies,
does
it,
assuming
intermediate
scrutiny?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
you
spent
your
life
in
the
civil
rights
movement
or
the
right
to
bear
arms
movement
or
one
or
the
other
sides
of
the
abortion
debate,
and
these
are
your
acquaintances,
this
is
your
--
it's
been
one
of
your
principal
activities,
not
for
pay,
but
just
because
of
your
civic
commitment.
and
then
you
are
elected
to
the
legislature
and
under
this
nevada
statute
that
controls,
must
you
recuse
whenever
an
officer
of
that
association
has
--
is
paid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
have
coffee
together
every
morning
and
they're
in
the
same
book
club.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
doesn't
apply
to
outside
advocacy?
it
just
applies
to
advocacy
within
the
limits--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
even
if
you
have
a
law
which
is
not
directed
to
speech
and
is
directed
at
conduct
which
is
not
speech,
that
law
is
still
--
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
even
under
intermediate
scrutiny,
subject
to
invalidation
if
it
has
a
chilling
effect
on
--
on
speech
as
an
incidental
matter,
if
that
chilling
effect
is
more
than
is
necessary
to
accomplish
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you're
going
to
make
this
argument
--
and
this
is
the
point
we
discussed
with
mr.
elwood
--
there
are
two
ways
to
do
it.
number
one,
say
this
infringes
the
right
to
vote,
which
is
a
first
amendment
right;
or
you
can
say
that
this
impinges
unduly
on
necessary
rights
of
association
that
preceded
your
election
to
the
legislative
post.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
latter
is
the
only
way
that
you
can
make
your
case
and
to
avoid
the
force
of
the
argument
that
the
petitioner
makes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
but
that
--
but
that's
unworkable
to
say,
you
know,
that
every
potential
--
i
think
i
might
run
for
office
next
year
and
so
i'm
going
to
get
advice
from
some
committee
as
to
who
i
can
associate
with?
that
just
is
unworkable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
standard
for
vagueness
that
we
apply?
we
apply
vagueness
to
first
amendment
prohibitions
or
restrictions
on
speech.
we
apply
vagueness
to
criminal
statutes.
this
isn't
a
criminal
statute.
it
does
have
a
civil
penalty.
what
is
the
case
that
i
consult
to
see
what
standard
of
vagueness
i
apply?
