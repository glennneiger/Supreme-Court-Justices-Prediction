ruth
bader

as
i
understand
the
objection,
it's
not
to
the
recusal
rules
in
general,
but
it's
to
the
vagueness
of
this
particular
one.
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
concern
about
the
specific
categories
that
were
mentioned,
like
family
member
or
employer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we're
dealing
not
with
can
you
have
recusal
rules.
everybody
believes,
yes,
you
can.
it's
the
degree
of
specificity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
in
this
context.
and
you
don't
disagree
that
--
i
forgot
which
brief
told
us
that
there's
no
state
has
a
similar
catch-all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosenkranz,
you
are
not
--
is
it
right
that
you
are
not
challenging
any
part
of
this
statute
except
the
one
that
--
that
says
"substantially
similar"?
the
rest
you
have
no
constitutional
objection
to;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no
--
there's
no
--
i
thought
this
--
the
--
the
only
reason
that
we
have
this
case
is
that
the
three-time
campaign
manager
was
--
did
have
a
financial
stake
in
this
vote
because
the
project
was
approved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
different
from
the
ones
that
mr.
elwood
read
to
us.
think
he
read
probably
one
from
new
jersey
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
any
catch-all
that
you
would
say
would
pass
your
constitutional
test?
you
told
us
that
the
four
specific
categories,
member
of
the
household,
employer,
that
those
are
all
right
because
they're
specific.
but
you
don't
like
the
"substantially
similar".
is
there
any
catch-all
that
a
legislature
could
adopt
that
would
pass
what
you
--
what's
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
--
in
the
nevada
court
you
argued
overbreadth.
that
was
the
--
at
least
how
the
court
understood
your
challenge,
and
here
overbreadth
takes
a
back
seat,
and
vagueness
is
the
principle
on
which
you
rely
dominantly.
so
what
accounts
for
the
shift?
you
were
arguing
overbreadth
before
the
nevada
supreme
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
way
to
get
advice
as
to
--
i
think
you
said
he
went
to
the
county
attorney,
he
could
have
gone
to
--
to
the
ethics
commission,
and
they
were
told
ethics
commissions
can
give
advice
only
after
the
--
is
in
office,
they
don't
give
--
they
are
not
obliged
to
give
advice
to
candidates.
so
when
carrigan
is
running
he
apparently
has
no
access
to
the
ethics
commission?
