mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
core
problem
with
this
statute
which
the
court
has
been
grappling
with
is
this:
an
elect
--
an
unelected
commission
has
arrogated
to
itself
essentially
the
right
to
invalidate
an
election
result
and
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
treats
core
political
association
as
corrupting.
if
the
police
of
political
purity
are
going
to
tell
an
elected
official
that
he
cannot
cast
the
vote
that
he
ran
on
and
was
elected
to
cast,
they
have
to
do
it
clearly,
they
have
to
do
it
prospectively,
and
they
have
to
do
it
for
an
important
reason.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
that
is
a
way
of
organizing
the
institution
that
applies
equally
to
all
members
of
the
institution.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
well,
this
will
--
this
will
single
out
individuals
at
any
particular
moment
in
time
who
are
specifically
isolated
and
told
that
that
particular
individual
cannot
vote.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
well,
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--and
my
--
my
point
is
simply
that
this
takes
one
particular
legislator
and
says,
you
cannot
vote.
and
those
rules
are
completely
fine
in
certain
circumstances,
but
not
when
the
effect
is
to
tell
someone
that
the
rationale,
the
reason
that
you
are
being
isolated
is
because
you
associated
with
someone
politically
who
helped
you
win
an
election.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
more
precisely,
we
are
challenging
the
use
of
that
"substantially
similar"
provision
to
expand
the
statute
to
--
to
relationships
that
bear
no
relation
to
the
actual
text
of
the
statute.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
here's
--
here's
what
you
can
get
out
of,
your
honor.
you
can
get
out
of
--
for
example,
if
you
are,
in
addition
to
being
a
judge,
a
law
professor
at
a
state
university
and
that
university
fires
you
because
of
an
opinion
that
you
issued,
that
opinion
is
speech.
that
vote
has
speech
aspects
to
it.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
judges
are
just
plain
different
from
legislators.
judges
are
supposed
to
bring
no
political
loyalties
at
all
to
them
when
they
are
sitting
on
the
bench.
legislators
are
actually
not
only
allowed
to,
but
expected,
to
bring
political
loyalties
when
they--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--the
answer
again,
your
honor,
is
when
it
comes
to
judges,
we
tolerate
quite
a
bit
more
by
way
of
chill
of
a
judge's
vote
precisely
because
judges
are
supposed
to
act
judicial
and
purge
their
vote
of
all
extraneous
effects.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
i
--
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
the
secretary
of
defense
has
a
first
amendment
argument.
it
would
be
a
very
weak
one
under
--
under
this
court's
opinion
in
garcetti.
but
his
first
amendment
rights
are
implicated
if
it's
a
speech
that
he's
giving
not
in
the
line
of
his
duty.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
and
that
was
this
court's
holding
in
garcetti.
and
the
reason
this
court
held
that
in
garcetti
was
that
there
the
government
is
acting
as
employer.
the
government
is
entitled
to
discipline
its
own
employees
like
any
other
employer
can.
but
we
all
agree
government
as
employer,
that
pickering
standard,
doesn't
really
work
in
the
context
of
regulation
of
political
activity.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
within
the
chamber,
your
honor,
no,
if
it's
just
the
chamber
that's
sanctioning
someone.
and
the
reason
is
those
are
roberts
rules
of
order
that
apply
to
everyone
and
that
--
that
order
the
--
the
debate.
but
i--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--and
--
and
so
this
is
a
rule,
though
--
we
have
to
go
back
to
what
its
effect
is
outside
of
the
legislature.
this
is
a
rule
that
takes
political
associations
and
treats
them
as
corrupting,
core
political
associations,
volunteering
of
the
sort--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--it
would
not
be
vague,
your
honor.
but
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
unless
the
state
demonstrates
why
a
campaign
manager
is
corrupting.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
and
--
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
a
volunteer
campaign
manager
is
not
just
like
a
business
partner.
there
is
no
pecuniary
gain
to
the
--
to
the
candidate
or
the
legislator
as
there
is
in
a
relationship
with
a
business
partner.
there's
personal
political
loyalty.
that's
what
the
ethics
commission
said
was
wrong--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
why
we're
here.
that's
not
why
the
commission
said
we
are
here
in
the
first
instance.
the
commission
is
now
saying
we're
here
because
of
that,
but
what
the
commission
said
was
it's
the
closeness
of
this
relationship,
without
regard
to
the
financial
gain,
which
the
commission
accepted
was
zero
for
this
particular
lobbyist.
regardless
of
the
financial
gain,
it
was
the
political
loyalty.
this
guy
helped
you
win.
because
he
helped
you
win,
you
will
be
beholden
to
him
and
do
him
more
favors.
well,
lots
of
political
activists
help
a
candidate
win.
but
on
that--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
it
is
certainly
correct
that
the
latter
is
far
narrower.
this
is
an
outlier
statute.
no
other
legislature
has
ever
adopted
a
statute
that
says
campaign
manager
or
political
loyalty
is
corrupting.
and
so
this
court
could
very
easily
say,
look,
this
is
just
different
from
all
of
the
other
recusal
statutes.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
your
honor,
he
--
he
cited
one
case
from
new
jersey.
the
statute
does
not
refer
to
political
loyalty.
and
in
that
case
it
was
a
close
friendship,
and
in
the
course
of
describing
the
close
friendship
the
court,
after
listing
multiple
factors,
said
one
of
them
was
that
they
were
both
part
of
the
same
political
club.
they
also
vacationed
together.
that's
a
completely
different
application.
no
state
and
no
commission
--
so
far
as
we
know
from
the
briefs,
there's
no
case
cited
where
any
commission
has
said
this
relationship
between
a
volunteer
and
a
candidate
is
itself
so
corrupting
that
we
have
to
disqualify
the
candidate
from
casting
the
vote,
the
vote
that
he
ran
on,
that
the
voters
elected
him
to
cast.
and
if
this
--
if
this
is
accepted,
it
places
an
impossible
drag
on
the
associational
rights.
the
candidate
will
have
to
think
twice
before
ever
hiring
or
enlisting
a
volunteer
who
is
a
political
activist.
he
will
want
to
recruit
the
best,
the
most
talented,
the
most
savvy,
but
he
will
always
have
to
ask
himself:
what
will
this
person
do
3
years
from
now
that
might
disqualify
me
from
--
from
embarking
on
my
duty
that
i
was
elected
to
engage
in?
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor.
let
me
give
you
a
concrete
example
from
real
life
that
happens
all
the
time.
if
the
nra
or
naral
decide
that
they
believe
strongly
in
a
piece
of
legislation
and
they
hire
a
lobbyist,
so
there's
benefit
to
the
lobbyist
from
this
relationship,
and
that
lobbyist
says
"i,
too,
am
on
mission;
i
continually
lose
in
the
legislature
because
it
hangs
in
the
balance,
i'm
going
to
work
for
candidates
who
will
tip
the
balance
for
me,
the
commission's
opinion
says
that
that
lobbyist,
because
he's
worked
on
that
campaign
and
wins,
will
by
that
very
act
invalidate
the
vote
of
the
legislator.
"
that's
just
untenable,
and
there's
no
way
to
interpret
the
--
the
opinion
that
the
commission
actually
wrote
to
make
that
anything
other
than
the
natural
consequence
of
its
--
of
its
opinion.
and
worse
yet,
from
the
--
from
the--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--well--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor.
yet
the
legislature
comes
in
with
an
amicus
brief
to
this
court
and
says
that
its
interpretation
of
this
statute
is
all
it
needs
to
have
is
a
relationship
that
is
analogous
or
parallel
to
those
--
this
is
on
page
32
of
their
amicus
brief
--
analogous
or
parallel,
and
they
are
defending
the
application
of
this
statute
to
political
loyalty.
but
let's
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
equation;
that
is
the
--
the
vasquezes
of
the
world,
the
nra
advocate.
on
that
side
of
the
equation,
anyone
who
deeply
holds
a
view
that's
political
--
let's
say
it's
mr.
vasquez,
he
is
pro-development.
they
will
refrain
from
joining
campaigns
out
of
fear
that
when
they
join
the
campaign,
they
will
get
the
candidate
disqualified.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
that--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
they
gave
a
gestalt
at
the
end.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
they
lead
with
"instrumental
in
the
success
of
all
three
of
councilman
carrigan's
campaigns.
"
and
they
go
through
a
long
narrative
about
the
political
relationship.
these
were
not--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--because
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
judges
are
a--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--yes.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
so--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--the
answer
is
no,
not
when
it
affects
associational
rights.
so
let
me
just
distinguish--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--oh
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
the
commission--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--i
don't
know
why
the
court
didn't
address
it.
it
was
front
and
center.
it
was
a
section
--
it
was
called
overbreadth,
but
for
eight
pages,
from
page
9
to
page
18,
there
is
extensive
discussion
that
what
they
meant
by
overbreadth
is
this
reaches
too
broad,
this
reaches
relationships
that
should
not
be
reached.
it
was
not
in
the
cert
opposition,
but
it
was
front
and
center
before
the
nevada
supreme
court.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
i
--
it's
hard
to
imagine
one.
let
me
just
point
out,
no
--
it
is
very,
very
rare
for
a
legislature
to
do
anything
other
than
what's
in
a
through
d.
and
the
problem
with
this
catch-all,
which
by
the
way
is
the
term
that
was
used
by
both
the
courts
below
--
the
problem
with
this
catch-all
is
perhaps
the
words
are
okay,
maybe.
i
mean,
i
can
imagine
someone
interpreting
those
words
so
narrowly
that
they're
okay.
but
what
this
catch-all
does
is
to
add
language
to
the
original
four
criteria,
so
it's
not
just
family
members
and
business
associates.
it's
now
friends,
close
friends.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
the
answer,
your
honor,
is
the
judiciary
does
not
engage
in
political
activity
outside--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--and
the
answer
is
that
the
candidate
and
the
volunteer
have
to
know
ex
ante
whether
to
engage
in
this
relationship
or
not.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
and
the--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
the
advisory
process,
the
problem
with
it
is
that
it
comes
too
late.
the
relationship
was
already
in
place.
if
you're
--
if
the
--
if
the
commission
is
going
to
invalidate
the
result
of
an
election,
where
everyone
is
talking
about
this
issue
and
everyone
knows
about
this
relationship,
they've
got
to
tell
them
before
they're
engaged
in
the
relationship.
mr.
carrigan
would
have
dropped
mr.
vasquez.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
my
point
exactly,
your
honor.
you
cannot
--
you
--
you
don't
know
in
advance,
because
you
can't
know
what's
going
to
come
out
3
years
later.
you
can't
know
what
conflicts
will
arise,
and
so
you
don't
know
in
advance.
you
can't
present
the
question
to
the
--
to
the
commission.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
correct,
your
honor;
and
it
is
both.
there
are
basically
two
halves
to
it.
one
is,
even
if
statute
were
perfectly
clear,
this
is
a
relationship
that
the
state
is
not
allowed
to
view
as
toxic,
because
it
is
not
a
toxic
relationship
in
a
democratic
process;
and
secondly,
this
is
also
vague,
so
there
was
no
notice
up
front
as
to
the
fact
that
the
commission
would
later
invalidate
the
result
of
the
election
on
this
basis.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
it
is
a
baseline
vagueness
argument
on
due
process
grounds,
but
it
gets
elevated
because
of
the
first
amendment
interest.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
oh,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
absolutely.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
the
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
shifted.
so
before
the
nevada
supreme
court,
everything
was
on
the
table.
there
was
vagueness,
there
was
overbreadth,
there
was
extended
relationships
--
extending
to
a
relationship
that's
first
amendment-protected.
the
two
key
pieces,
first
was
vagueness
and
then
second
was
this
overbreadth
argument
as
i've
described
it,
which
really
was
about
the
protected
relationship.
the
nevada
supreme
court
called
it
overbreadth,
but
if
you
look
carefully
at
what
it
actually
says,
it
is
vagueness
at
every
step
of
the
way.
it
is
talking
about
--
this
is
on
pages
14
to
15
on
to
16
and
17.
it
is
talking
about
the
constitution
demanding
a
high
level
of--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--gentile,
your
honor.
gentile
is
a
case
that
is
about
sanctions.
it's
about
sanctions
for
first
amendment-protected
activity.
and
the
standard
really
is
--
i
mean,
it's
articulated
the
same
way
in
all
these
circumstances,
but
it
really
is,
can
a
reasonably
intelligent
person
know
in
advance
that
they
are
going
to
be
sanctioned
for
this?
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
i
think--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
that's
perfectly
appropriate.
that
is
in
fact
what
mr.
carrigan
did
right
at
the
outset
of--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--a
lot,
yes;
but
a
lot
less
so.
and
this
court
has
--
is
very
comfortable
with
disclosure
when
you're
talking
about
public
officials
as
lighter
medicine,
less
severe
medicine
than
an
outright
ban
or
a
punishment
for
that
association.
that's
the
way
it
should
work
in
the
political
process.
everyone
in
this
election
was
aware
of
vasquez's
role.
it
was
front
page
news
when
the
hearing
was
going
on.
and
so
for
a
commission--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--oh--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--because
as
he
testified,
and
the
commission
did
not
disagree,
this
guy
is
a
boy
scout,
your
honor.
he
does
everything
to
avoid
any
appearance
of
impropriety.
and
he
said:
i
did
that
because
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure;
i
am
not
a
lawyer.
and
the
city
attorney,
of
course,
gave
an
opinion
that
gave
him
a
clean
bill
of
health,
said:
yes,
go
forth
and
do
this.
now,
if
the
lawyer
doesn't
know
and
the
commissioners
can't
settle
on
which
of
these
things
the
relationship
is
most
similar
to,
and
the
district
court
can't
choose
one,
how
is
it
possible
for
someone
in
mr.
carrigan's
position
to
know
ex
ante--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--less
so
in
the
first
amendment
--
i
mean,
more
so
in
the
first
amendment
context.
in
all
the
other
contexts,
the
standards
are
lightened--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
and
there
is
a--
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
--and
--
and
there
is
a
big
difference
between
ambiguity
of
particular
words
and
what
the
commission
did
here,
which
was
to
say
we
see
these
four
categories,
we
are
not
applying
any
of
these
four
categories.
we're
saying
--
we're
extracting
a
principle.
it's
a
principle
of
closeness.
now,
close
enough
for
government
work
when
it
comes
to
relationships
that
are
first
amendment
protected
just
isn't
good
enough
when
it
--
when
you're
talking
about
that
context.
so
i
did
want
to
talk
just
for
a
moment
about
the
degree
of
burden
that
we're
talking
about
here,
because
the
commission
seems
to
be
saying
no
big
deal,
this
is
just
a
disqualification
provision.
it's
not
actually
a
burden
at
all.
now,
i
think
we
all
agree
that
if
the
state
of
nevada
declared
that
anyone
who
is
a
campaign
manager
can
never
lobby
the
legislature,
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
and
they'll
fine
them
for
it,
where
the
strict
scrutiny
would
also
apply
if
the
state
passed
a
law
fining
a
candidate
for
choosing
a
campaign
manager
who
lobbies
the
legislature.
mr.
joshua
e
rosenkranz
it
would
be
subject
to
scrutiny
for
sure.
it
would
be
subject
to
first
amendment
scrutiny.
and
that
would
be
justified
on
the
ground
not
of
the
closeness
of
relationships
that
are
formed,
but
on
the
ground
that
you
don't
want
legislators
here
and
now
as
they
are
sitting
in
the
chamber
thinking
about
generating
business
with
their
future
clients
and
changing
their
votes
because
of
that.
that's
the
justification.
but
there's
no
such
justification
here.
the
commission
has
never
articulated
why
political
loyalty
is
so
toxic
that
it
needs
to
be
banished
from
politics.
and
so,
just
on
the
--
on
the
directness
of
the
burden
yet,
for
a
political
activist
who
is
engaged
in
these
sorts
of
relationships,
the
burden
of
being
told,
you've
got
to
choose
right
at
the
outset,
are
you
going
to
represent
--
are
you
going
to
help
this
candidate
get
elected
or
are
you
going
to
lobby?
that
is
worse
than
a
fine,
because
a
political
activist
wants
to
do
both
precisely
because
they
care
about
the
ultimate
results.
and
for
the
candidate
himself
who
is
deciding
right
upfront
which
of
the
universe
of
players
am
i
going
to
take
as
volunteers,
they
need
to
know
upfront
whether
this
relationship
will
be
viewed
as
toxic,
and
if
it
is,
they
will
not
engage
in
that
relationship.
this
is
no
less
direct
than
the
burden
that
this
court
recognized
as
unconstitutional
in
the
davis
case,
the
millionaire's
amendment
case,
or
in
burdick,
where
the
only
burden
was
that
the
paid
petitioner
would
have
to
register
to
vote,
which
is
a
nominal
burden,
but
those
whose
consciences
were
affected
by
a
registration
were
kept
out
of
the
process.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
respectfully
request
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment.
thank
you.
