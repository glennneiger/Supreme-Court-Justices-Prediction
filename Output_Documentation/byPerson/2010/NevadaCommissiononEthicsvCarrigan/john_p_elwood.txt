mr.
john
p.
elwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
neutral
laws
requiring
official
recusal
for
conflict
of
interest
do
not
abridge
free
speech
because
a
legislator's
vote,
however
expressive,
is
not
protected
speech.
it
is,
rather,
a
legally
binding
exercise
of
state
power
that
he
wields
as
an
incident
of
public
office.
the
nevada
supreme
court
concluded
that
respondent
did
have
a
free
speech
right
to
vote,
and
that
overrode
the
nevada
recusal
statute.
for
four
reasons,
that
holding
was
error.
first,
since
the
earliest
days
of
the
republic
recusal
rules
have
been
understood
to
serve
important
interests
unrelated
to
any
views
a
legislator
may
want
to
express,
by
requiring
disqualification
when
circumstances
indicate
that
private
interests
may
have
affected
his
independence
of
judgment.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
the
court
could
simply
address
what
the
nevada
supreme
court
did
and
tell
it
whether
it
got
it
right
or
got
it
wrong,
whether
there's
a
speech
interest,
and
what
--
whether
that
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
or
not.
but
i
think
that,
even
though
that
argument
i
don't
think
was
raised
or
passed
on
below,
that
the
court
would
have
discretion
to
address
that.
i
think
it
would
give
additional
guidance
to
the
nevada
supreme
court.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
--
i
think
you're
right,
justice
kennedy,
that
it
would
provide
more
guidance
to
the
nevada
supreme
court.
it
would
be
a
pretty
narrow
reversal
and
remand,
assuming
that
the
court
merely
reached
the
speech
question.
but
on
the
associational
question,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
from
the
outset
that
i
think
this
would
have
a
negligible
effect
on
association,
because
it
simply
would
not
apply
all
that
frequently.
in
order
for
the
recusal
statute
to
apply,
two
circumstances
have
to
be
simultaneously
met.
first,
there
has
to
be
a
qualifying
relationship
which
is
close
and
ongoing,
and
simultaneously
it
must
have
the
--
it
must
--
the
third
party
must
have
a
private,
usually
pecuniary,
interest
before
that
same
legislator.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that
is
correct,
justice--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--well,
that
was
the
basis
of
the
holding
of
the
nevada
supreme
court,
was
that
those
implicated
speech
rights
and
that
all
of
them
would
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
so
from
the
outset,
we
may
all
be
agreed
that
the
court
below
applied
fundamentally
too
high
a
level
of
scrutiny.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no,
but
i
think
that
the
--
our
response
to
the
vagueness
argument
is
that
respondent
concedes
that
the
four
categories
for
members
of
your
households,
relatives,
employers,
and
business
relationships
are
clear.
he
says
that
on
page
2
of
his
brief.
so
the
question
is
whether
the
"substantially
similar"
language
gums
up
the
works,
essentially.
now,
"substantially
similar"
is
a
statutory
phrase
that
has
had
to
have
been
used
by
every
state
legislature
in
the
country
and
by
congress.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
well,
first,
i
would
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
it
as
a
catch-all,
because
it
only
sweeps
in
relationships
that
are
substantially
similar.
but
seattle,
for
example,
has
a,
what
is
a
true
catch-all,
which
sweeps
in
--
it
applies
"whenever
it
could
appear
to
a
reasonable
person
having
knowledge
of
the
relevant
circumstances
that
the
covered
individual's
judgment
is
impaired
because
of
either
a
personal
or
business
relationship
not
covered
under
subsection
a
or
b
above.
"
which
lists
the
covered
relationships,
"or
a
transaction
or
activity
engaged
in
by
the
covered
individual.
"
so
while
nevada
may
be
the
only
statute
that
applies
"substantially
similar"
to
these
four
categories,
it
is
not
alone
in
that
structure.
and
i
think
more
importantly,
it
is
not
anywhere
close
to
alone
in
its
breadth.
the
new
jersey
statute
is
i
think,
if
anything,
broader:
"a
direct
or
indirect
financial
or
personal
involvement.
"
there
are
numerous
state
statutes
which
apply
to
business
associates.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
it
would
include
the
things
--
the
same
things
that
are
covered
by
ordinary
--
every
other
recusal
statute,
which
is
very
close
personal
relationships
and
relationships
that
give
rise
to
a
financial
interest
on
the
--
for
the
public
official.
and
we're
not
talking
about,
you
know--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--well,
i
think
that
in
the
case
of
the
relative,
yes,
it's
the
financial
interest
of
the
relative,
and
that's
why
the
very
close
personal
relationship.
but
all
of
the
other
relationships
for
members
of
the
household,
who
are
presumably
part
of
the
same
economic
unit,
and
for
employers,
in
whom
the
officer
has
obviously
a
very
close
financial
interest
and
they're
tied
together,
and
for
business
relationships,
all
of
those
are
to
get
at
the
financial
interests
of
the
officer,
not
of
the
third
party.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
yes.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
the
--
it
would
depend
on
a
couple
of
things.
first
of
all,
it
is
a
covered
relationship,
the
second
cousin
would
be
a
covered
relationship.
and
--
and
i
think
the
interest
there
i
think
would
be
the
subject
of
some
debate
whether
it
is
a
private
interest
because
it
is
a
broadly
shared
interest.
but
i
suppose
because
his
property
taxes
might
increase,
it
would
be
a
private
interest.
there
is
still
the
question
of
whether
a
reasonable
person
under
those
circumstances
would
view
his
--
his
judgment,
his
independence
of
judgment,
as
being
materially
affected.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
well,
the
way
that
that
has
been
defined,
and
this
appears
--
this
is
not
just
a
nevada
commission
on
ethics
interpretation.
this
is
what
the
legislature
understood
it
to
mean,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
when
they
added
the
statute
in
1999.
what
they
were
looking
for
by
adding
the
"substantially
similar"
relationships
were
relationships
that
were
substantially
similar
to
household
and
substantially
similar
to
family.
and
what
is
at
issue
there
is
not
the
fact
that
you
have
a
genetic
similarity
makes
you
more
likely
to
see
things
their
way,
but
that
families
are
presumed
to
be
among
your
closest
relationships.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no,
your
honor.
because,
to
begin
with,
a
personal
relationship,
it
only
covers
the
very
closest
personal
relationships.
so
your
most
intimate
and
closest
relationships
on
earth
would
be
covered.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
and
even
that,
justice
kennedy,
applies
with
extraordinary
rareness.
the
last
case
that
i'm
aware
of
where
personal
interests
alone
justified
recusal
was
in
1999
before
the
statute
was
amended.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
certainly,
justice
scalia,
i
would
not
think
so.
and
this
is
the
first
case
that
i'm
aware
of,
it's
the
first
time
anyone
has
said
it
to
my
knowledge.
i
don't
even
know
of
law
review
articles
that
said
it
before
basically
the
decision
that
is
under
review
for
neutral
laws
of
general
applicability.
but
to
return
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
what
this
law--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
agree
emphatically
with
justice
scalia,
except
that
i
could
never
put
it
as
well
as
he
did.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
it
is
true.
and
in
addition
to
that,
to
expand
it
even
more,
apply
it
even
more
broadly,
with
the
exception
of
essentially
the
d.c.
circuit's
opinion
in
clarke
v.
united
states,
this
is
the
first
opinion
i'm
aware
of
where
anyone
has
even
held
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
interest
in
any
sort
of
expressive
official
act.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
justice,
but
i
think--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--oh,
absolutely
we
would,
because
i
think
r.a.v.
v.
city
of
st.
paul
speech
that
is
subject
to
prescription
can't
be
regulated
in
a
viewpoint-based
manner.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
but
even
speech
that
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
such
as
fighting
words
in
r.a.v.,
can't
be
regulated
in
a
viewpoint-based
manner.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
they
could
challenge
it
in
a
way
--
alleging
that
it
was
viewpoint-based
if
it
were
only
applied
to
democrats
or
republicans.
but
i
don't
think
that
if
it
were
an
otherwise
normally
applicable
rule
that
it
would
be
subject
to
challenge
on
that
basis.
that
is
the
relevance
of
neutrality.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
well,
in
the
event,
justice
kagan,
that
is
how
i
interpret
r.a.v.,
that
it
would
not
be
an
available
option
to
have
a
viewpoint-based
recusal
statute
that
affected
things
differently
depending
on
viewpoint.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
they
are
--
i
think
that
they're
--
i
think
that
they're
neutrally
applicable.
don't
know
that
they
would
--
i
am
not
aware
of
them
applying
different
amounts
of
time
to
majority
and
minority
members.
i
may
be
incorrect
about
that.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
any
time
you're
talking
about
--
i
mean,
depending
on
what
the
house
is,
there's
an
extra
measure
of
deference
when
you're
applying,
obviously,
to
the
houses
of
congress.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
they
certainly
do
come.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
but
in
any
event,
all
the
court
even
needs
to
get
to
is
whether
laws
of
neutral
applicability
would
be
covered,
because
that's
all
this
statute
is.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
but
that
is
essentially--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--but
that
is
to
essentially
complete
the
disqualification
just
as
under
thomas
jefferson's
recusal
rule.
when
you
were
disqualified
under
jefferson's
rule,
you
were
out
of
it.
you
couldn't
essentially
function
as
a
legislator,
and
that's
all
that
attempts
to
do.
it
hasn't
been
applied
to
mr.
carrigan.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
absolutely.
it
does
not
apply
to
advocacy
as
a
citizen
outside
the
legislature.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
--
if
it
is
reviewed
--
i
mean,
it
depends
on
the
test
you
use.
we
don't
think
that
o'brien,
which
is
a
test
that
some
of
the
amici
have
proposed,
is
an
appropriate
standard,
because
even
o'brien
is
talking
about
laws
that
have
a
much
greater
effect
on
expression
because,
after
all,
burning
a
draft
card,
one
of
the
main
reasons
you
would
want
to
do
that
is
an
expressive
reason.
whereas
these
really
are
laws
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
views
people
think
you
are
going
to
be
expressing.
and
we
think
that
a
closer
analogy
are
cases
like
burdick,
where
there
are
laws
of
neutral
applicability
that
states
use
to
regulate
their
processes
of
self-government.
and
those,
unless
they
have
a
severe
burden
on
association,
have
been
subject
to
review
for
reasonableness
under
burdick
and
timmons,
and
that
entire
line
of
cases.
we
think
that
furnishes
a
much
more
appropriate
analogy
for
this
case.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
but,
justice
breyer--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--but
justice--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
get
as
far
as
the
position
that
justice
kagan
was
suggesting,
that
i
think
justice
scalia
is
suggesting,
because
we're
willing
to
abide
by
r.a.v.
and
require
neutrality
in
the
regulations
of
this.
i
think
the--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--right.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
you
would
say
that
it
is
not,
that
it
is
not
--
voting--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--right.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
--
justice
breyer,
we
again
are
willing
to
bite
off
--
we
are
willing
to
abide
by
r.a.v.--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it
can
be
a
neutral
restriction
on
voting,
which
is
not
itself--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
that
that
represents--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
--
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
be.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
justice,
i
just
think
that
there
are
certain
things
that
you
don't
--
there's
a
--
there's
a
sort
of
principle
when
you're
dealing
with
other
branches
of
government
that
you
don't
look
behind
it
when
they
certify
things.
this
court
has
held
that
in
various
contexts.
and
i
don't
think
--
you
know,
it
may
well
be
that
that
would
support
an
even
--
a
stronger
rule
than
we
are
advocating;
but,
you
know,
all
we
are
here
to
defend
is
a
neutral
law
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
nevada.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
but
i
think
that
if
there's
any
law
that
has
a
better
claim
to
--
to
be
added
to
that
category,
it's
one
that
would
be
consistent
with
a
law
or
a
rule
that
was
adopted
by
the
first
congress
7
days
after
they
first
achieved
a
quorum.
i
mean,
those
were
the
people
who
were
the
people
who
proposed
and
framed
the
first
amendment,
and
they
never
indicated
that
they
thought
any
sort
of
personal
first
amendment
right
was
implicated
by
recusal
rules,
either
by
them
or
thomas
jefferson's
rule,
which
was
not
even
a
rule
adopted
by
the
whole
house.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
absolutely.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that
is
absolutely
correct.
we
view
it
as
basically
completing
the
disqualification
and
saying
you
are
just
not,
you
cannot
act
as
a
legislature
in
deciding
whether
this
bill
will
be
passed.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
absolutely,
they
can.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
--
i
think
they
would
be
viable
under
the
--
the
way
we
are
framing
it,
which
is
that
basically
if
it's
a
law
of
general
applicability
that
you
could
still
bring
a
claim
of
retaliation,
which
--
those
kind
of
claims
are
problematic
for
other
reasons
because
there's
a
lot
of
what
would
be
called
retaliation
that
is
itself
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
but
if
you're
talking
about
a
official
who
is
a
civil
service
employee,
assuming
you
need
to
even
get
there
because
they
have
their
own
civil
service
rights
to
be
there,
they
would
still
have
the
claim
that
it
was
based
on
viewpoint-based
discrimination,
and
under
the
rule
we
are
proposing
--
or
the
rule
that
we
are
willing
to
abide
by,
certainly
--
r.a.v.
v.
city
of
st.
paul
would
protect
those
people
for
a
retaliation
claim.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that
is
true,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that's
true.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that
is
true,
and
this
law
applied
--
for
the
better
part
of
30
years,
it
applied
to
every
legislator
in
the
state
of
nevada.
in
july
of
2009
the
state
supreme
court
struck
it
down
as
applied
to
members
of
the
legislature.
but
this
was
the
rule
they
lived
under
and
they
didn't
think
it
was
ambiguous,
they
didn't
think
that
it
chilled
their
associational
rights.
they
seemed
to
think
it
was
just
--
that
it
was
just
fine.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
that
is
another
one
of
those--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--those
sort
of
discriminatory
enforcement
claims
are
whole
'nother
ball
of
wax.
and
i
mean,
they're
certainly,
you
know,
very
hard
to
prove;
and
they
bring
up
all
those
sort
of
armstrong
issues
about,
you
know,
presumptive
regularity
and
that
people
are
acting
in
good
faith.
i
don't
know
that
that
would
be
a
first
amendment
claim,
but
perhaps
a
equal
protection
claim.
but
it's
certainly
not
presented
here.
there's
never
been
any
allegation
that
these
laws
have
been
enforced
discriminatorily.
in
fact,
arising
from
the
same
vote,
the
nevada
commission
on
ethics
sanctioned
an
opponent
of
the
lazy
8
casino
because
he
had
an
undisclosed
interest
in
--
business
interest
in
the
nugget,
which
was
a
political
opponent
of
this.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
now,
my
colleague
argues
that
the
nevada
recusal
statute
targets
political
association,
and
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
nothing
in
the
statute
about
politics.
mr.
carrigan
was
recused
because
he
had
a
business
relationship
with
mr.
vasquez.
wholly
apart
from
the
personal
relationship
and
the
fact
that
he
was
his
three-time
campaign
manager,
he
was
also
the
firm
--
the
campaign's
main
outside
vendor,
and
89
percent
of
the
carrigan
campaign
expenditures
were
paid
through
his
advertising
firm.
that
is--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
that--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
the
fact
that
this
happened
to
be
a
political
relationship
was
incidental.
if
mr.
carrigan
--
mr.
vasquez
does
two
things,
he's
a
campaign
manager,
he's
a
--
he
assists
in
development.
if
mr.
carrigan
had
had
exactly
the
same
relationship,
but
had
just
been
working
with
him
on
the
development
side,
it
would
have
been
exactly
the
same
situation.
if
he
had
helped
him
with
past
--
i
think
the
fact
that--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
--
i
don't
believe
so.
that
they've
made
that
argument--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that
--
right.
what
we
have
here
--
i
don't
know
if
they
use
the
term
that
it
was
incidental.
but
i
mean
they
--
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
at
pages
105
to
106
of
the
pet.
app,
it's
clear
that
they're
looking
at
the
business
relationship.
it's
relevant,
certainly,
to
have
helped
him
win
three
elections,
because
that's
relevant
to
the
closeness
of
their
personal
relationship,
but--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i'm
sorry?
i
--
the
argument
by
the--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--oh.
my
understanding,
the
way
i
view
the
briefs
is
there
two
references
to
an
associational
right
in
the
briefs,
and
the
opening
brief
before
the
supreme
court,
i
think
it's
page
918
--
and
it
was
in
the
context
of
making
a
vagueness
argument.
i
looked
through
it,
you
can
look
through
it
and
see
what
you
think,
but
i
did
not
see
that
as
an
argument
that
this
is
burdening
our
associational
rights.
but
i
think--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
that
--
i
think
probably
not,
because
if
the
question
is
whether
it
--
it
burdens
associations
so
much
that
it's
chilling,
and
i
mean,
basically
i
think
that's
a
--
an
empirical
question.
and
because
you
have
to
have
a
particular
interest,
a
private
interest
in
order
to
be
recused,
i
think
that
it
wouldn't
arise
so
frequently
that
it
would
be
a
problem;
but
i
think
more
fundamentally
here,
or
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
case,
because
it
comes
here
at
least
respondent
says
this
as
an
as-applied
challenge.
what
we
have
here
is
a
relationship
that
was
front
page
news,
because
this
isn't
just
some
plain
vanilla
campaign
volunteer.
this
is
somebody
with
whom
he
has
a
very
intimate
business
relationship
that
--
that
involved
this
expenditure
of
$46,000.
and
i
think
another
thing
that
is
worth
noting
is
that
in
10
years
on
the
books
this
law
has
never
been
applied
to
campaign
volunteers.
it's
--
in
order
--
campaign
volunteers
specifically
come
up
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
'99
act,
and
they
would
say
would
not,
without
more,
be
covered,
because
what
this
covers
is
the
same
types
of
relationships
that
every
other
recusal
statute
covers
--
very
close
relationships
and
relationships
that
give
rise
to
a
financial
interest
in
the
public
official.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
basis
under
the
nevada
law.
because
that's
a
law--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--because
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
a
personal
relationship,
it's
not
household,
it's
not
relative,
it's
not
employer,
and
it's
not
a
business
relationship.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
that's
right.
the
ethics
commission
only
has
authority
to
give
opinions
to
sitting
candidates.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
