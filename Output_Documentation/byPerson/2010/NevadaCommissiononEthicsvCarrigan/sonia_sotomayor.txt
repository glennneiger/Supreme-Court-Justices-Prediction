justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
just
to
clarify
this
issue,
because
i
don't
know
that
i've
heard
you
state
it
explicitly,
the
second
part
of
this
recusal
statute
that
bars
the
advocacy
of
a
measure
in
which
there's
an
interest
prohibited
by
the
statute,
it
is
your
position
that's
advocacy
in
the
legislative
body?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
only
limited
to
getting
up
on
the
floor
and
talking
about
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
person
can
still
go
outside
and
give
all
the
press
releases
they
want?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
we
do
with
cases
like
miller
v.
town
of
hull
and
colson
v.
grohman
that
have
recognized
retaliation
claims
because
of
speeches
given
during
the
casting
of
a
vote?
would
those
cases
still
be
viable
if
we
decide
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
right
in
voting?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
is
that
different
from
the
minority
people
in
the
chief
justice's?
it
only
affects
them
when
they're
in
the
minority?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
only
affects
somebody
if
they
fall
within
the
strictures
of
the
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
you
argue
associational
rights
below?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
do
you
think
the
court
didn't
address
it?
because
it
relied
on
the
first
amendment
analysis?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
the
relationship
wasn't
particularly
special,
no
more
special
than
any
other
political
volunteer,
why
did
that
become
front
page
news?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
if
your
client
didn't
have
a
suspicion
that
he
was
on
the
edge
of
a
law,
why
did
he
bother
going
to
the
city
attorney
to
get
an
opinion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
will
we
ever
write
--
how
will
the
congress
ever
write
a
law
that
would
be
so
clear
that
clients
would
never
have
to
go
to
lawyers--
[laughter]
--or
that
lawyers
couldn't
disagree
about?
we
would
have
to
invalidate
virtually
every
law
as
vague.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you're
not
--
you're
not
denying
that
most
laws
would
be
vague--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--under
that
definition?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
lawyers
disagree
on
the
conclusion
of
what
the
law
means?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
justice
breyer's
question
--
he
can
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
is
whether
that
argument
by
them
was
actually
raised
below
the
way
he
is
stating
today?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
whether
that
associational
right
of
the
political--
