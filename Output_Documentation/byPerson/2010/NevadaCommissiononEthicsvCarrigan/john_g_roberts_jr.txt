chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
our
last
argument
of
the
term
is
in
case
10-568,
nevada
commission
on
ethics
v.
carrigan.
mr.
elwood.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
modified
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
by
saying
you're
not
aware
of
any
case
that
applied
the
first
amendment
to
rules
of
general
--
neutral
rules
of
general
applicability,
i
think.
but
if
the
first
amendment
doesn't
apply,
that
doesn't
matter,
does
it?
you
can't
limit
your
--
the
type
of
rules
that
you
say
are
not
--
are
okay
and
are
not
if
the
first
amendment
doesn't
apply
at
all?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
the
first
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
this
type
of
activity,
then
you
would
have
no
first
amendment
objection
to
biased
rules
of
specific
applicability.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
position
was
that
this
wasn't
speech
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
someone
can
challenge
one
of
these
rules
on
the
grounds
that
it's
not
neutral,
that
it
applies
in
a
disproportionate
way
to
particular
members
of
the
legislature?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
that
the
rules
in
the
house
of
representatives
allocating
time
on
the
floor
or
committee
membership
are
neutral?
they're
biased
in
favor
of
whichever
party
happens
to
be
in
the
majority.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
you
would
have
a
first
amendment
claim
under
your
theory
if
the
generally
applicable
rule
was
applied
in
a
discriminatory
manner;
it
turned
out,
you
go
back
and
look
and
over
the
last
2
years
the
only
people
who
have
been
sanctioned
for
violating
the
ethics
rules
have
been
members
of
the
minority
party.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
be
a
viable
first
amendment--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
elwood.
mr.
rosenkranz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
legislature
adopts
a
rule
that
says
from
now
on
we're
going
to
require
a
four-fifths
majority
for
a
bill
to
pass,
that
lowers
the
effectiveness
of
the
speech
of
someone
in
the
minority,
and
you
can
challenge
that
on
first
amendment
grounds?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i've
kind
of
lost
the
thread
of
your
argument.
is
this
a
vagueness
claim
or
a
first
amendment
claim?
i
gather
your
claim
is
going
to
be
the
same
even
if
the
statute
clearly
said
family
members,
you
know,
business
partners,
and
political
consultants.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
your
vagueness
argument,
is
that
a
first
amendment
argument
of
its
own?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
can
decide
your
vagueness
--
if
we
agree
with
you
on
vagueness,
we
don't
have
to
determine
whether
the
first
amendment
applies
in
this
type
of
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
here
we're
talking
about
penalty
for
participating.
what
--
what
if
it's
a
disclosure
rule
saying,
you
know,
you
can
participate,
you
can
vote,
you
can
advocate,
you
just
have
to
disclose
interest
of
this
sort.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
problematic
under--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--right.
well,
doesn't
that
burden
his
first
amendment
rights?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
elwood,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
