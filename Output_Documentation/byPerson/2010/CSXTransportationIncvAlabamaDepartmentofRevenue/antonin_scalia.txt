justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
this
is
what
troubles
me
about
--
about
your
position:
you
make
a
viscerally
appealing
case
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
you
say
that
your
clients,
the
railroads,
are
being
taxed
more
than
competing
carriers,
truckers
and
--
and
water
carriers.
but
if
all
--
if
all
it
says
is
85
and
doesn't
make
the
same
exemption
for
railroads,
the
railroads
win,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
how
do
you
limit
the
term
"discrimination"?
just
a
discrimination
in
favor
of
other
competing
carriers?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
do
you
assume
that?
congress
didn't
limit
it
to
that
in
--
in
the
property
tax
exemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
--
not
just
the
industrial
and
--
and
commercial
competitors
with
the
railroads.
the
railroads
were
to
be
given,
you
know,
the
most
favored
treatment
of
--
of
all
the
industrial
and
--
and
commercial
entities,
i
--
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
85-year-old
widows
would
be
covered?
that
would
be
discrimination
because,
you
know,
there
are
only
resident
85-year-old
widows
who
are
covered,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
that,
and
that
makes
me
suspect
that
congress
didn't
--
didn't
want
to
forbid
exemptions
in
(b)(4).
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
make
any
--
any
sense,
you
are
quite
right;
but
--
but
congress
thought
it
made
sense
in
(1)
to
(3),
so
why
doesn't
it
make
sense
in
(4)?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
use
a
lot
of
conjunctions.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
understand
your
last
answer.
what
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
don't
understand
why
you
think
it
is
--
it
is
more
articulable
on
your
theory
than
on
theirs.
i
don't
see
where
solving
your
predictability
problem,
you're
worried
about
it,
you
know,
we
don't
know
how
to
tax
anymore.
i
don't
know
why
it's
any
more
certain
if
we
--
if
we
say
the
key
is
whether
it's
a
generally
applicable
tax
than
it
is
if
we
say
the
key
is
whether
it
discriminates
against
railroads.
i
mean
it's
the
same
inquiry.
so
what
do
you
care?
it's
just
as
--
just
as
unpredictable
ex
ante.
it's
exactly
the
same
inquiry,
whether
it's
generally
applicable
or
whether
it
discriminates
against
railroads.
isn't
--
isn't
--
isn't
that
what
you
have
been
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it's
twiddle
dum
or
twiddle
dee,
maybe
we
should,
you
know,
dismiss
this
as
improvidently
granted,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
know
what
"generally
applicable"
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
least
i
don't
know.
how
do
you
know?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
how
are
these
any
different
from
property
taxes?
i
mean
states
could
say
the
same
thing
about
property
taxes.
nonetheless
it
was
felt
necessary
to
specify
that
--
that
exemptions
don't
count.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
deciding
whether
or
not
you
are
discriminating
against
the
railroads.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
do
you
agree
that
--
that,
generally
applicable
produces
the
same
--
requires
the
same
inquiry
as
discriminates?
