justice
stephen
g.
breyer
haven't
you
just
pushed
all
the
difficult
questions
into
the
word
"generally
applicable"?
i
imagine
a
fuel
tax
applies
to
everybody
in
the
state,
but
then
we
exempt
everybody
who
does
business
in
the
state
with
fuel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
except
for
railroads.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
now.
you
want
to
call
that
not
a
generally
applicable
class?
do
you
want
to
call
it
a
discrimination
against
railroads?
it
seems
to
me
about
the
same
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
why
isn't
the
easiest
thing
to
say,
since
there's
so
many
other
questions
involved
in
discrimination:
yes,
the
clause
applies?
what
counts
is
a
discrimination
is
an
obviously
difficult
question,
and
we
will
send
it
back
for
somebody
else
to
wrestle
with
this,
since
it's
so
difficult.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
choice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
realize
that,
but
what
they
are
worried
about
is
somebody
that's
having
passed
on
the
property
level--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--thinks
i
have
a
great
revenue-raising
idea.
what
we
do
is
tax
the
new
york
central,
and
then
they
sit
down
with
a
bunch
of
lawyers
and
the
lawyers
say:
oh,
great,
they
come
through
this
state;
what
we'll
do
is
we'll
have
a
tax
that
applies
to
all
fuel
and
then
we
will
exempt
everybody
except
the
new
york
central.
all
right.
great.
we've
now
found
a
replacement
of
the
revenue
that
they
just
said
in
congress
we
couldn't
have
in
the
first
three
provisions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
because
you're
saying
that's
not
generally
applicable.
they
are
saying
sure
it
is,
read
the
first
line,
applies
to
everybody.
you
say
no,
no,
no.
that's
a
trick
because
of
the
second
line.
so
now
what
we
will
do
is
we'll
monkey
around
with
it
a
little
bit.
and
we
will
make
it
tough.
all
i'm
saying
is
that's
precisely
the
same
question
in
that
context
as
whether
it's
discriminates
or
not.
i'm
not
saying
it's
an
easy
question.
i'm
just
saying
it
might
be
clearer
if
we
said,
yes,
the
thing
applies,
now
go
work
out
the
hard
question
of
whether
you
had
have
got
a
discriminatory
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
property
taxes,
the
language
is
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
assuming
how
the
court
will
decide
the
word
"discriminate".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
what
you
are
saying,
and
so
would
every
other
judge.
and
of
course,
it's
hard
to
figure
out
in
these
contexts
what
is
real
discrimination,
but
there
could
be
obvious
cases.
and
so
why
cut
out
the
obvious
cases
simply
because
it's
hard
in
a
non-obvious
case
to
figure
it
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
way
--
there
is
no
way
with
the
property
--
the
property
tax
is
tough.
and
once
you
start
taking
exemptions
into
account,
it's
double
tough,
and
there
is
very
little
need,
is
there?
every
state
in
the
country
has
property
taxes
and
every
state
in
the
country
has
property
taxes
on
businesses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
it
might
not
be
so
that
every
state
in
the
country
has
particular
taxes
on
diesel
fuel.
and
it
might
be
that
they
don't
have
taxes
on
rails,
or
it
might
be
that
they
--
you
see?
so,
i
--
i
--
that's
how
i
am
explaining
to
myself.
what
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
it's
not
quite,
because
this
is
the
same
problem
i
was
raising.
you
just
shoved
the
difficult
questions
into
generally
applicable.
but
you
might
think
of
some
new
ways
of
doing
it
that
they
don't
want.
so
i
would
worry
about
giving
you
just
the
decision
where
the
word
in
the
statute
is
"discriminate",
and
nowhere
does
it
say
"generally
applicable".
i'd
somewhat
worry
about
whether
this
statute
shoves
the
same
problems
into
two
words
that
aren't
there
as
to
rather
leaving
those
problems
for
resolution
under
the
one
word
that
is
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
believe
you,
i'll
believe
you.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
word
--
the
word
i
was
looking
at
was
is
4,
impose
another
tax
that
discriminates
against
a
rail
carrier
providing
transportation,
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
under
this
part.
now,
i
read
all
the
words
of
4,
and
i
found
the
word
"discriminates",
and
i
did
not
find
the
two
words
"generally
applicable".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
in
all
these
years
where
they
never
challenged
it,
did
all
these
other
states
not
only
tax
their
diesel
fuel,
but
at
the
same
time
exempt
the
diesel
fuel
tax
from
all
their
competitors.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
rationale,
that
the
trucks
don't
have
to
say
it
but
the
railroads
do?
