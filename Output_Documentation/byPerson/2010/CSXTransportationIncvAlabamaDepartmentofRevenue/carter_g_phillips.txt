mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
pivotal,
and
in
my
judgment,
incorrect
holding
of
the
eleventh
circuit
in
the
norfolk
southern
case
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
this
case,
because
norfolk
southern
is
the
controlling
precedent
for
our
--
for
our
particular
dispute.
and
at
page
29a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
in
there,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
4-r
act's
plain
language
that
indicates
an
intent
to
reach
exemptions
content
from
generally
applicable
sales
and
use
taxes.
to
our
way
of
thinking,
all
this
case
is
about:
whether
or
not
the
state
has
free
reign
to
employ
exemptions
without
exposing
the
effects
of
those
exemptions
to
a
challenge
under
(b)(4)
of
the
statute.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
what
we
are
doing
is
recognizing
that
congress
was
very
specific
and
very
explicit
about
how
to
treat
property
taxes
and
set
up
an
entire
quite
carefully
articulated
scheme
in
dealing
with
them
in
(b)(1)
and
(b)(3),
and
then
said,
in
general,
when
you
are
dealing
with
areas
that
are
not
approved
by
(b)(1)
and
(b)(3),
then
you
have
to
examine
whether
or
not
the
overall
scheme,
in
fact,
discriminates
against
rail
carriers.
so,
while
it
is
true
that
there
could
be
circumstances
in
which
you
may
end
up
with
somewhat
more
protection
as
a
consequence
of
(b)(4),
i
think
that's
a
function
of
congress
not
having
limited
the
(b)(4)
exemption
to
property,
and
just
saying
it's
--
it's
a
discrimination
against
the
rail
carrier
generally
that
the
statute
is
aimed
to
prevent
or
to
protect
against.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
because
congress
didn't
have
the
full
run
mine
of
possibilities
in
front
of
it
at
that
point
in
time.
i
mean,
it
probably
had
some
sense
of
what
other
taxes
were
out
there
that
might
pose
discrimination,
but
i
do
think
that
congress
is
very
much
concerned
that
the
states,
once
they
saw
the
roadmap
laid
out
for
them
in
(b)(1)
through
(b)(3),
might
seek
other
ways
to
recoup
what
they
were
going
to
lose
in
revenues
when
the
3-year
period
lapsed,
and
to
be
in
a
position
to
protect
the
railroads
in
the
(b)(4)
--
through
(b)(4)
in
a
situation
when
there
would
be
future
actions
taken
by
the
states.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
--
there's
very
little
in
the
legislative
record,
your
honor,
because
the
--
the
specific
formulation
of
--
of
this
(b)(4)
catch-all
provision
comes
in
very,
very
late
in
the
15-year
process.
every
other
lower
court
that
--
every
lower
court
that
has
looked
at
it
has
drawn
the
inference,
which
seems
to
me
the
only
fair
inference
to
draw,
when
congress
said:
look,
this
is
not
just
for
in
lieu
taxes.
i
mean,
there
was
--
there
was
some
debate
about
that
going
on
between
the
house
and
the
senate,
and
the
conference
committee
makes
it
clear.
this
is
not
just
something
that's
adopted
by
the
states
in
lieu
of
a
broader
property
tax.
it
is
intended,
then,
to
have,
i
think,
the
language
that
you
would
normally
give
to
a
term
as
broad
and
sweeping
as
any
other
tax
that
discriminates
against
rail
carriers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
--
that
--
no,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
necessary--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
it
--
it
is
discrimination
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
prohibit
under
these
circumstances.
so
i
think
in
the
situation
where
you
are
talking
about
a
single
exemption
for
some
group
that
does
not
compete
or
otherwise
do
any
business
with
the
railroads,
we
would
not
have
a
basis
for
saying
they
were
similarly
situated--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
--
it
did
to
some
extent,
because
there
was
a
whole
question
about
how
--
you
know,
you
had
a
whole
comparative
class
that
congress
defines
in
the
property
context.
so
you
make
a
context
between
the
industrial
and
commercial
property
and
the
railroads'
property.
so
congress
defined
the
comparison
class,
but
i
don't
think
it's
fair--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
be
sure,
justice
scalia,
but
it
was
still
as
compared
to
the
entirety
of
the
industrial
and
commercial
property
base,
and
it
was
--
and
the
analysis
has
traditionally
been
the
averages
of
the
commercial
industrial
property.
so
you
--
and
part
of
the
problem
here
--
it's
not
a
problem,
but,
you
know,
one
of
the
reasons
why
you
can't
make
direct
comparisons
is
that
because
of
acf
industries,
you
don't
evaluate
exemptions
under
(b)(1)
to
(b)(3)--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
but
--
remember,
justice
kennedy,
we
don't
even
get
to
this
issue
if
what
you
say
is
we
are
going
to
take
all
exemptions
off
the
table.
and
i
guess
i
would
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
point,
which
is
that
there
is
a
reason
why
this
is
a
viscerally
satisfying
case,
because
we
are
talking
here
about
a
discrimination.
you
know,
when
congress
says,
we
want
to
--
we
want
to
eliminate
any
tax
that
discriminates
against,
the
one
thing
it
seems
to
me,
clearly,
congress
did
not
intend
to
exclude
from
that
was
a
tax
that
discriminates
against
the
--
the
immediate
direct
competitors
of
the
railroads
in
a
way
that
would
undoubtedly
undermine
the
stability
of
the
--
the
financial
stability
and
success
of
the
railroad.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
--
that's
correct,
justice
ginsberg,
but
i
think
the
premise
of
your
--
of
your
question
is
the
place
where
we
would
probably
differ,
which
is:
to
be
sure,
congress
intended
to
protect
interstate
carriers
against
discrimination
in
favor
of
local
operations.
that's
clear
in
(b)(1)
through
(b)(3)
and
otherwise
pervades
the
legislative
history.
but
there
is
also
a
significant
amount
of
discussion
in
that
same
legislative
history
to
encourage
intermodal
competition;
that
is,
competition
between
the
railroads
and
others,
both
intrastate
and
interstate.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
that's
--
that
prohibits
all
discrimination
against
rail
carriers,
identified
as
carriers--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
can
see
us
making
that
argument--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
always
like
to
come
back,
but
i
don't
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
--
again,
i
think
the
--
the
court
ought
to
interpret
the
term
"discrimination"
against
the
clear
objectives
that
congress
intended
to
fulfill
when
it
protected
the
railroads
this
way.
and
the
two
protections
that
are
embedded
in
there
is
one
that
justice
ginsberg
identified,
which
was
to
protect
them
against
local
interests
in
a
way
where
they
had
no
political
influence,
and
the
other
one
is
to
protect
them
against
their
direct
competitors
in
the
intermodal
competition
realm.
and
if
it's
--
if
it's
a
discrimination
that
doesn't
achieve
either
of
those,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
either
say
they
are
--
are
not
similarly
situated
or
you
would
held
--
you
would
hold
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
reason
for
doing
what
it's
doing,
and
that
that's
just
not
a
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
they
would
have
--
they
would
be,
to
be
sure,
local
interests.
but
i
think
the
problem
with
this
is,
and
it
goes
to
the
core
argument
that
the
state
makes,
which
is:
how
are
you
supposed
to
define
"local
business"
for
these
purposes.
and
i
don't
think
the
--
the
answer
to
that
is:
i
have
no
way
to
know
that,
because
congress
didn't
purport
to
define
the
comparison
class
for
purposes
of
(b)(4).
it
seems
to
me
that
when
congress
said
"any
other
tax"--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
it
seems
to
me
quite
--
i
mean,
the
flip
side
of
that
argument
would
be
to
say,
if
they
imposed
the
tax
of
4
percent
on
the
railroads
and
2
percent
on
85-year-old
widows,
that
would
be
challengeable
under
(b)(4),
because
it's
not
an
exemption,
it's
a
differential,
and
that
the
exemption
down
to
zero
is
--
is
attackable
under
(b)(4).
it
seems
to
me
the
right
answer
to
this
is,
there
is
no
reason
to
include
your
widow
as
a
relative
comparison
class
for
purposes
of
(b)(4)
and
get
out
of
that
problem
as
opposed
to
setting
this
up.
to
me,
the
fallacy
of
this
analysis
is
to
try
to
use
exemptions
and
say
that
there
is
something
special
about
exemptions
beyond
the
(b)(1),
(b)(3)
context
where
congress
clearly
acted,
recognizing
that
it
had
to
protect
the
states'
ability
to
have
exemptions
for
property
taxes.
but
then
congress
goes
to
non-property
taxes
and
to
other
taxes
not
covered
by
(b)(1)
and
(b)(3).
then,
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
to
--
you
just
should
change
the
analysis.
look
at
whether
or
not
similarly
situated
are
being
treated
differently
and
if
there
is
any
kind
of
state
justification
for
that,
and
if
not,
go
through
the
analysis
in
the
way
--
and
protect
the
railroads
precisely
the
way
that
congress
meant
for
them
to
be
protected.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think,
ultimately,
my
conclusion
would
be
that
you
can't
have
one
--
you
can't
have
this
kind
of
a
tax
on
us
and
not
tax
the
motor
carriers
the
same
way.
but
i
do
think
it's
important
to
recognize
two
considerations,
at
least
as
this
case
comes
to
this
court.
one
is
that
the
state
and
the
trial
court
conceded
that
the
appropriate
comparison
class
was
the
motor
and
water
carriers.
so
the
question
of
who
is
the
--
who
is
properly
in
the
comparison
class
has
never
been
adjudicated.
and
second,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
what
constitutes
discrimination
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
something
special
about
exemptions
that
makes
them
off-limits
to
the
(b)(4)
inquiry.
so
i
think,
candidly,
justice
ginsburg,
while
i'm
quite
certain
that
alabama
and
i
would
disagree
fundamentally
about
how
to
approach
this,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that's
a
question
that
this
court
should
tarry
long
over,
and
instead
ought
to
simply
evaluate
the
very
narrow
question
that
was
both
presented
by
the
holding
below
and
presented
in
the
petition
as
it
came
through
the
solicitor
general's
invitation
stage,
which
again,
as
i
say,
very
narrowly
focuses
exclusively
on
exemptions,
and
of
course
allow
us
to
have
them.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
part
of
the
reason,
it
may
well
be
because
the
property
tax
was
a
big-ticket
item,
so
you
were
trying
to
protect
certain
state
interests,
and
congress
did
it
very
clearly.
i
think
it
is
quite
a
remarkable
stretch
of
--
of
construction
of
the
statute
for
the
court
to
say,
we're
going
to
take
this
very
carefully
reticulated
scheme,
which
creates
the
inference
that
congress
meant
to
protect
these
kinds
of
exemptions
for
the
states,
and
say
we
are
going
to
now
incorporate
that
wholesale,
when
congress
didn't
use
language
that
in
any
way
compares.
it
didn't
include
--
it
didn't
limit
it
to
railroad
property.
it
didn't
define
a
class
in
any
particular
way,
and
instead,
it
basically
said,
what
we
need
here
is
something
that
will
protect
the
railroads
when
the
states
become
more
innovative
and
come
forward
with
additional
problems.
and
we
would
leave
it
to
the
courts,
unfortunately
--
i
recognize
that
is
not
the
most
satisfying
solution
sometimes,
but
we
will
leave
it
to
the
courts
to
decide
what
forms
of
discrimination
we
would
have
intended
to
preclude,
because
we
are
here
to
protect
the
railroads.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
--
a
few
quick
points.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
reason
why
the
states
didn't
challenge
these
tax
exemptions
earlier;
for
some
of
us
it's
relatively
easy
to
remember
what
the
price
of
fuel
oil
was
back
in
the
1970s,
it
was
somewhere
in
the
sort
of
10
to
30
cents
a
gallon
range.
therefore
exemptions
of
that
amount
of
tax,
1
percent
exemption
of
that
amount
of
tax
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
money.
today
the
rates
are
$4
a
gallon,
and
an
exemption
under
those
circumstances,
particularly
when
you
have
a
fixed
rate
for
your
major
competitor,
gives
you
a
more
than
substantial
incentive
to
bring
an
action
under
these
circumstances.
the
notion
that
somehow
the
--
the
state
has
gone
down
this
path
because
of
federal
law
has
not
been
true
for
at
least
15
years.
that
statute
was
repealed
and
alabama
could
have
modified
its
tax
however
it
wanted
to
and
chose
not
to
do
so.
justice
alito,
your
hypothetical
i
think
is
almost
exactly
this
case,
because
as
my
friend
indicated,
diesel
fuel
is
by
far
the
biggest
expense
that
the
railroads
have.
it's
also
a
very
significant
expense
for
the
motor
carriers,
and
it
is
a
pretty
trivial
expense
for
everybody
else
in
the
--
in
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you're
ultimately
going
to
have
to
come
down
to
the
same
issue,
and
the
problem
is,
and
i
--
the
reason
why
i
--
i
find
it
hard
to
accept
justice
kennedy's
formulation,
which
is
simply
singling
out
the
railroads,
because
in
acf
the
court
sort
of
said
well,
we
will
hold
that
out
as
a
possibility.
if
you're
doing
--
you
know,
it
would
be
one
thing
if
you
are
just
singling
them
out.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
statute
like
(b)(4),
where
you
--
where
you
are
more
broadly,
and
you
don't
have
the
(b)(1)
to
(b)(3)
baggage
to
deal
with
property
taxes,
the
idea
that
you
would
then
limit
(b)(4)
solely
to
the
situation
of
singling
out
is
--
is
simply
not
a
fair
way
to
characterize
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
it
has
to
be
that
--
the
traditional
and
common
understanding
of
discriminate
is
that
you
treat
similarly
situated
individuals
differently
without
--
with
an
adequate
justification.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
depends
on
the
--
it's
going
to
depend
on
the
tax,
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
in
this
context,
because
as
justice
alito's
question
reveals--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
could
be
that
the
vast
majority
of
diesel
fuel
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
--
the
first
one
i
think
without
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
second
one
has
more
of
a
problem,
because
i
don't
think
congress
intended
to
allow
to
you
favor
direct
competitors
of
the
railroads
when
the
ultimate
effect
of
that
may
be
to
undermine
the
--
the
financial
stability
of
the
railroads.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
define.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i
think
ultimately
the
way
to
analyze
this
is
case
is
what
was
congress's
ultimate
objective.
and
if
the
state
is
putting
forward
a
legitimate
reason
that
is
fully
consistent
with
congress's
overall
objective,
then
there
is

which
suggests
to
me
that
there
are
two
ways
to
worry
about
discrimination.
have
you
singled
out
other
carriers
for
more
favorable
treatment?
there
i
think
if
the
answer
is
per
se,
if
you
do
that
you
lose.
and
if
you
are
not
in
that
world
and
you
are
talking
about
some
other
classes,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
depends
on
how
far
you
want
to
go
in
terms
of
how
much
of
an
exemption
you
want
to
play.
but
the
important
part
of
this
is
still
and
i
think
the
questions
to
mr.
maze
reflected
is
that
you
should
undertake
the
inquiry
to
determine
whether
there
is
discrimination
even
if
the
state
happens
to
use
the
guise
of
exemptions
as
opposed
to
rate
differentials
or
anything
else.
there
is
nothing
special
about
exemptions
that
takes
it
off
the
table.
it
proposes
the
federalism
concerns
and
that
acf
spoke
to
this
issue.
acf
said
you
should
not
extend
the
statute
beyond
its
evident
reach
reflecting
the
(b)(1),
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4)
relationship
without
a
clear
statement.
that's
not
what
we
have
in
this
case,
your
honor.
