justice
sonia
sotomayor
--in
the
legislative
record?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
may
i
pose
a
hypothetical
so
that
i
understand?
and
i
think
it
follows
up
on
what
justice
alito
was
saying.
let's
assume
all
taxes
are
equal
between
water
carriers
and
railroads,
except
there
is
an
excise
tax:
4
percent
on
the
railroads,
2
percent
on
the
water
carriers.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
everybody
else
pays
4
percent.
on
your
theory,
is
that
discrimination
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
this
is
not
an
exemption
area,
so
what
meaning
do
you
give
--
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out.
are
you
saying
--
what
meaning
are
you
giving
to
discrimination
at
all,
other
than
--
unless
we
accept
that
the
class
always
has
to
be
the
commercial
class?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
there's
100
businesses,
where
does
the
line
between
singling
out
the
railroad
get
drawn?
when
they
exempt
98?
when
they
exempt
97?
when
they
exempt
95,
or
is
it
at
80?
where
do
we
draw
the
singling
out?
if
the
state
says
the
general
tax
is
4
percent,
but
everybody
--
but
how
many
are
exempted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
sense
would
there
be
for
congress
to
use
the
word
4
percent
like
everyone
else,
but
their
competitors,
for
no
reason
other
than
that
the
state
wants
to
favor
the
water
carrier,
is
only
paying
2
percent?
what
--
what
conceivable
reason
would
congress
want
that
differential
to
exist?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
talking
about
an
exemption.
i'm
talking
about
a
rate
difference.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
to
answer
that
question,
you
are
telling
us
that
we
have
to
define
what
discrimination
means?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
not
quite
--
it's
not
quite
that.
you
forget
the
other
part
of
the
test,
which
is
without
a
reason.
now,
the
other
side
hasn't
defined
what
a
legitimate
reason
would
be.
and
that's
a
separate
inquiry.
but
if
there
is
a
--
some
form
of
legitimate
reason
to
treat
people
differently,
i
think
the
other
side
is
saying
that's
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
their
particular
facts
of
their
case.
i
mean,
that's
what
they
have
to
come
up
and
explain
to
us,
what's
the
--
what's
the
defining
principle
of
acceptable
or
unacceptable
different
treatment,
because
it
can't
be
--
you're
right,
logically,
it
can't
be
most
favored
taxpayer
status.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
so
far,
yes,
unless
they
can
give--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
having
a
problem.
i
thought
as
you
argued
in
your
brief
that
you
were
only
arguing
that
states
can
tax-exempt,
but
you
are
asking
us
to
rule
more
broadly
to
say
that
states
can
treat
--
impose
taxes
differently.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
doesn't
really
matter
that
it's
a
tax
exemption;
you
are
just
saying
if
the
tax
is
a
positive
imposition
or
a
negative
one,
taking
someone
out,
it
doesn't
matter.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
give
me
a
definition
of
discriminate.
give
me
your
working
--
it
can't
--
as
i
started
to
ask
your
adversary,
it
can't
be
most
favored
taxpayer
status.
true?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
constitutes
an
adequate
justification?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--stop.
you
are
going
to
grant
an
exemption;
you
are
going
to
treat
someone
differently
because
you
are
favoring
them
for
a
reason.
people
don't
--
states
don't
do
these
willy-nilly.
either
some
enterprises
or
some
individuals,
like
the
85-year-old
widow,
you
are
sympathetic
to
her.
you
want
to
encourage
your
water
transport,
because
it's
an
industry
that
is
nascent
in
your
state
and
you
want
it
to
grow,
so
it's
a
pro-competition
reason.
are
those
legitimate?
and
if
those
are--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
isn't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
give
me
a
working
principle.
what
does
--
how
do
you
define
legitimate
and
illegitimate,
assuming--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
government
reason
is
always
going
to
be
premised
on
wanting
to
favor
someone
for
a
reason.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
is
the
problem
because
there
were
two
objectives.
one
was
to
promote
equality
with
local
businesses
and
the
other
to
promote
equality--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--right.
