what's
the

justice
elena
kagan
ms.
sherry,
there
seems
to
be
a
question
as
to
what
remedy
somebody
would
be
entitled
to
under
subsection
(c)
in
the
challenge
brought
against
a
tax
exemption.
so
what's
the
government's
position
on
that?
justice
elena
kagan
in
1976,
congress
enacted
the
railroad
revitalization
and
regulatory
reform
act,
sometimes
called
the
“4r
act,”
to
restore
the
financial
stability
of
railroads.
a
provision
of
the
act
prohibits
state
governments
from
discriminating
against
railroads
through
their
tax
systems.
the
provision
contains
four
separate
prohibitions.
the
first
three
are
directed
at
discriminatory
property
taxes.
the
fourth
is
the
one
at
issue
in
this
case.
it
prohibits
states
from
imposing
“another
tax
that
discriminates
against
a
rail
carrier.”
this
case
involves
a
challenge
that's
brought
by
a
railroad,
csx
to
an
alabama
tax.
the
tax
is
a
4%
sales
and
use
tax.
railroads
pay
this
tax
whenever
they
purchase
or
consume
diesel
fuel,
which
of
course
they
do
a
lot
of.
but
railroads'
main
competitors,
motor
carriers,
trucks
and
water
carriers,
ships,
those
competitors
are
exempt
from
the
tax.
what
csx
said
in
this
suit
was
that,
alabama
sales
and
use
tax
was
another
tax
that
discriminated
against
railroads
because
railroads
had
to
pay
the
tax,
while
these
other
entities,
their
competitors
did
not
have
to
pay
it.
but
the
eleventh
circuit
dismissed
csx's
suit.
it
said
that
the
statute
did
not
allow
railroads
to
challenge
the
tax
on
the
theory
that
the
tax
exempted
other
entities,
and
in
reaching
that
decision,
it
relied
on
the
prior
decision
of
this
court
called,
acf
industries.
we
held
in
acf
that
a
railroad
could
not
challenge
a
property
tax
based
on
the
tax
exemptions.
the
eleventh
circuit
thought
the
same
rule
should
apply
to
non-property
taxes
like
the
one
in
this
case.
today,
we
reversed
the
eleventh
circuit.
we
hold
that
a
railroad
can
challenge
a
non-property
tax
like
this
one,
on
the
ground
that
the
tax
contains
exemptions.
we
rely
on
the
plain
language
of
the
prohibition,
again,
another
tax
that
discriminates
against
a
rail
carrier.
first,
a
sales
and
use
tax
is
another
tax.
the
meaning
of
that
phrase
is
very
broad.
there
are
lots
of
different
kinds
of
taxes
in
the
world
as
all
of
you
taxpayers
know,
and
this
provision
includes
all
of
those
taxes.
second,
a
tax
that
contains
exemptions
can
discriminate
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
simply
put,
discrimination
is
the
failure
to
treat
people
in
the
same
way
without
a
good
reason.
so
if
one
person
has
to
pay
a
4%
tax
and
another
identically
situated
person
has
to
pay
2%
tax,
that's
discrimination.
and
the
same
is
true
if
the
first
person
has
to
pay
a
4%
tax
and
the
second
person
pays
0%,
nothing,
which
is
of
course
what
an
exemption
is.
that's
also
discrimination,
it's
even
worse
discrimination.
so
with
sales
and
use
tax
that
contains
exemptions
can
be
challenged
as
discriminatory
under
the
statute.
now,
all
of
this
would
be
easy.
it
would
be
obvious
except
for
the
case
of
the
eleventh
circuit
relied
on
acf
industries.
in
that
case,
you'll
recall,
we
held
that
a
railroad
could
not
challenge
a
property
tax
as
discriminatory
based
on
the
tax
exemptions.
so
a
very
considerable
part
of
this
opinion
is
devoted
to
explain
why
a
different
rule
should
apply
for
non-property
taxes.
and
i
won't
say
very
much
about
that,
it's
--
it's
complicated
but
it
comes
down
to
this.
the
congress
drafted
a
set
of
provisions
that
concerned
property
taxes
alone.
and
those
provisions,
for
whatever
reason,
prevent
property
tax
exemptions
from
being
viewed
as
discriminatory
under
the
statute.
but
those
provisions
have
nothing
to
say
about
non-property
taxes
and
so,
we
can
hold
and
today
we
do
hold
that
the
sales
and
use
tax,
unlike
a
property
tax,
might
discriminate
because
of
its
exemptions.
but
one
last
point,
we
do
not
decide
today
whether
alabama's
tax
in
fact
discriminates
against
csx
and
other
railroads
because
it
exempts
their
competitors.
alabama
might,
well
have
a
sufficient
reason
to
make
that
distinction
and
that
is
a
matter
for
the
trial
court
on
remand.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joins.
