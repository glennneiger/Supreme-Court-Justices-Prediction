ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
only
question
that
the
court
needs
to
resolve
today
is
whether
a
non-property
tax
that's
imposed
on
a
rail
carrier
but
from
which
its
competitors
are
exempt
can
ever
be
another
tax
that
discriminates
against
a
rail
carrier
under
subsection
(b)(4).
the
answer
is
yes.
a
lot
of
the
court's
questions
focus
on
some
of
the
difficulties
that
are
inherent
in
a
discrimination
inquiry,
but
as
mr.
phillips
pointed
out,
those
difficulties
are
just
as
inherent
in
a
discrimination
inquiry
under
(b)(4),
whether
we
are
talking
about
exemptions
or
whether
we
are
talking
about
differential
tax
rates
or
whether
we
are
talking
about
any
other
type
of
discrimination
claim
that
can
be
brought
under
(b)(4).
that
is
the
very
nature
of
(b)(4):
it
broadly
prohibits
another
tax
that
discriminates
against
a
rail
carrier,
and
inherent
is
that
is
the
notion
that
courts
are
going
to
have
to
decide
what
it
means
to
discriminate.
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
decide
it.
as
mr.
phillips
pointed
out,
that
was
an
issue
that
was
conceded
below
by
the
state,
at
least
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings.
and
they
acknowledged
that
in
note
7
of
their
brief,
so
it
wasn't
something
that
was
addressed
by
the
eleventh
circuit
below.
i
think,
as
the
court
wants
to
address
it,
it
should
reject
the
notion
that
the
only
comparison
class
in
a
(b)(4)
case,
no
matter
what
the
(b)(4)
case
looks
like,
is
all
other
commercial
and
industrial
taxpayers.
and
i
think
the
court
should
reject
that
primarily
because
that's
not
what
the
tax
says.
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
(b)(4),
it
talks
about
another
tax
that
discriminates
against
a
rail
carrier.
congress
easily
could
have
said
another
tax
that
discriminates
against
a
rail
carrier,
as
compared
to
other
commercial
and
industrial
taxpayers,
and
it
didn't
do
that.
and
justice
ginsburg,
to
your
question
involving
whether
we
should
be
focusing
on
interstate
versus
local
businesses
and
whether
that
was
congress's
focus,
of
course
that
was
--
that
was
certainly
one
of
their
concerns,
but
the
reason
that
doesn't
work
is
if
you
look
to
even
subsections
(b)(1)
through
(3),
the
comparison
that
is
very
clearly
spelled
out
there
is
not
between
local
businesses
and
interstate
businesses;
it's
between
rail
transportation
property
and
other
commercial
and
industrial
property.
now,
that
other
commercial
and
industrial
property
can
be
owned
by
an
interstate
business
like
wal-mart
just
as
easily
as
it
can
be
owned
by
a
local
coffee
shop,
and
so
i
think
to
suggest
that
the
only
thing
congress
wanted
to
prohibit
was
this
local
interstate
type
of
discrimination
is
not
borne
out
by
the
text.
if
you
look
at
subsection
(b)(4),
we
think
the
language
speaks
for
itself.
it
speaks
broadly
of
another
tax
that
discriminates
against
a
rail
carrier.
another
question
that
a
number
of
you
have
asked
is
why
congress
would
want
to
treat
property
taxes'
exemptions
differently
than
non-property
tax
exemptions,
and
i
think
the
answer
has
to
come
from
the
text.
in
acf,
this
court
concluded
that
congress
did
not
want
to
prohibit
property
tax
exemptions
based
on
the
text
of
the
statute
and
its
structure.
and
when
it
comes
to
non-property
taxes,
the
text
of
the
act
and
the
structure
of
the
act
simply
tell
a
different
story,
and
that
has
to
be
the
best
indicator
of
what
congress
intended.
again,
subsection
(b)(4)
speaks
broadly
of
another
tax
that
discriminates
against
a
rail
carrier.
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
taxes
can
discriminate
in
a
number
of
different
ways,
including
by
granting
some
taxpayers
an
exemption
and
not
granting
that
exemption
to
other
taxpayers.
that's
the
ordinary
meaning
of
(b)(4)
is
easily
susceptible
to
that
meaning.
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
the
government's
position,
first
with
respect
to
subsection
(c),
is
that
it
is
a
broad
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
district
courts
to
adjudicate
all
violations
of
subsection
(b),
and
that
seems
clear
from
the
first
sentence
in
that
provision.
i'd
also
note
that
the
arguments
that
were
made
with
respect
to
subsection
(c)
in
this
case
were
brought
up
by
the
government
in
acf;
and
in
acf
the
government
explained
why
the
best
reading
of
subsection
(c)
is
a
broad
grant
of
jurisdiction
over
all
violations
of
subsection
(b).
that's
clearly
what
congress
intended.
while
congress
intended
to
provide
a
substantive
right
for
rail
carriers
to
come
into
court
and
claim
discrimination
on
one
of
the
four
--
under
one
of
the
four
subsections,
it
also
intended
to
provide
a
federal
forum.
and
the
reason
that
it
did
that
was
because
at
the
time,
rail
carriers
were
having
a
very
hard
time
bringing
claims
in
the
state
court.
the
tax
injunction
act
was
out
there
then,
as
it
is
now,
and
it
does
provide
an
--
exception,
rather
--
for
when
state
court
remedies
are
not
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient.
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
i
think
in
that
type
of
case
the
remedy
would
be
for
the
rail
carrier
to
be
exempt
from
the
tax,
and
that's
because
what
subsection
(c)
provides--
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
--oh,
i
apologize.
i
should
back
up.
i
am
assuming
that
when
you
said
that
the
court
found
that
there
was
discrimination,
the
court
had
already
engaged
in
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
this
other
tax
compensates
for
or
provides
a
justification
for
any
differential
treatment.
if
the
--
the
court
were
to
find
discrimination
but
find
that
maybe,
you
know,
50
percent
of
the
tax
was
compensated
by
this
other
tax,
it
could
remedy
that
situation
by
only
enjoining,
and
it
should
remedy
the
situation
by
only
enjoining,
the
discriminatory
portion
of
the
tax.
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
and
i
don't--
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
--it
would
certainly
be
left
up
to
the
state
and
the
state
could
choose
to
remedy
it
in
--
in
any
number
of
different
ways,
including
the
one
that
your
honor
suggests,
but
the
remedy
that
is
actually
provided
for
in
subsection
(c)
for
the
federal
court
to
issue
is
to
enjoin
the
discriminatory
portion
of
the
tax,
and
the
focus
is
on
the
tax--
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
--i
--
i
think
it's
better
understood
as
--
as
--
as
speaking
specifically
to
the
tax
itself,
and
not
to
the
tax
exemption.
and
in
fact,
in
the
--
at
the
cert
stage
when
the
government
suggested
a
reformulated
question
presented,
it
reformulated
the
question
to
better
focus
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
challenge
to
a
discriminatory
tax
and
not
to
a
discriminatory
tax
exemption.
and
i
think
the
state
in
--
in
its
supplemental
brief
at
the
cert
stage
acknowledged
that
is
the
better
way
and
correct
way,
in
fact,
to
look
at
these
type
of
challenges
and
what
the
appropriate
remedy
would
be.
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
i
--
i
don't
know
that
the
court
has
to
--
has
to
go
with
one
or
the
other,
but
i
think
the
court
should
not
hold
that
it
only
applies
to
exemptions
to
the
--
to
the
extent
it's
the
type
of
tax
where
it's
generally
applicable
on
its
face,
but
everyone
is
exempt
except
for
the
rail
carriers,
or
everyone
is
exempt
except
for
the
rail
carriers
and
maybe
some
targeted
and
isolated
group,
as
--
as
this
court
recognized
in
acf.
and
the
reason
i
think
that
is
so
is
because
that's
what
the
language
provides
in
(b)(4).
certainly
congress
was
concerned
with
taxes
that
would
single
out
a
rail
carrier,
but
that
wasn't
their
only
concern.
and
an
example
that
i've
thought
of
but
i
think
helps
put
that
into
some
perspective
is:
i
think
alabama
would
concede
that
if
instead
of
imposing
a
generally
applicable
sales
tax,
it
had
a
separate
excise
tax
on
diesel
fuel
for
use
in
locomotives,
and
it
was
a
4
percent
tax,
looks
exactly
like
the
one
we
are
looking
at,
except
it
is
an
a
separate
excise
tax,
that
that
would
be
the
type
of
singled-out
tax
that
could
be
challenged
under
(b)(4).
and
it
makes
little
sense
that
they
--
that
a
state
could
basically
insert
that
type
of
tax
into
a
generally
applicable
sales
tax
and
that
would
be
immunized
from
any
scrutiny.
the
adverse
economic
impact
on
the
rail
carriers
is
the
same
whether
you
are
looking
at
a
singled-out
tax
or
whether
you
are
looking
at
a
generally
applicable--
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
--i
think--
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
--i
think
the
reason
that
congress
thought
it
made
sense
in
(1)
through
(3)
and
the
reason
that
this
court
in
acf
concluded
that
congress
wanted
to
permit
property
tax
exemptions
is
because
of
the
language
of
(1),
(2)
--
(1)
through
(3),
and
because
of
the
very
specific
comparison
class
that
is
provided
there.
that
is
noticeably
absent
from
(b)(4),
and
in
fact
wouldn't
really
work
in
(b)(4).
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
if
you
look
at
(b)(1)
and
you
look
at
(b)(3),
it's
a
comparison
between
transportation
rail
property
on
the
one
hand
and
commercial
and
industrial
property
on
the
other;
and
as
we
all
know,
commercial
and
industrial
property
is
specifically
defined
to
--
may
i
finish?
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
i
don't
know
if
i
will
get
to
the
point,
but
suffice
it
to
say--
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
--i'm
not
surprised.
ms.
melissa
a.
sherry
the
point
is:
(b)(4)
doesn't
talk
about
property;
it
talks
about
discrimination
against
the
rail
carrier,
and
the
comparison
class
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
that
subsection.
