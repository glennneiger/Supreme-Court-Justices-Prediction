do
you
think
we
have
to
decide
whether
the
appropriate
comparison
class
is
the
rail
carriers'
competitors
or
some
broader
class?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
are
arguing
in
favor
of
--
you
are
arguing
in
favor
of
a
very
idiosyncratic
interpretation
of
the
concept
of
a
discriminatory
tax,
aren't
you?
in
almost
any
other
context,
granting
tax
exemptions
to
one
group
but
denying
them
to
another
group
would
be
viewed
as
--
if
there
isn't
a
good
reason
for
drawing
the
distinction,
as
discrimination,
wouldn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
it
did
so
with
explicit
language
by
--
in
--
what
is
it
--
(a)(4),
by
referring
to
property
that
is
subject
to
a
property
tax
levy.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
ordinary
interpretation
of
the
concept
of
a
discriminatory
tax
should
not
be
applied
here,
because
congress
used
specific
language
to
take
tax
exemptions
out
of
the
determination
of
discrimination
under
other
provisions.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
sense
does
that
make?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
sense
does
that
make?
the
fact
that
they
specifically
took
it
out
of
some
provisions
but
not
out
of
this
provision,
you
think,
leads
to
the
implication
that
they
meant
to
put
it
in
here,
too,
where
they
could
have
easily
used
language
here
to
put
it
in.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
it's
a
commodity
that
is
purchased
by
only
railroads
and
one
other
class,
and
there
is
a
4
percent
sales
tax
on
this
commodity,
but
the
other
class
is
exempt
from
the
tax.
now,
is
that
--
is
that
discrimination
against
the
railroad?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let's
say
there
is
some
commodity
that
is
purchased
only
by
railroads
and
truckers,
and
there
is
a
4
percent
tax
on
the
commodity,
but
truckers
are
exempt
from
it
--
from
the
tax.
is
that
discrimination
against
the
railroad,
even
though
it
takes
the
form
of
--
it's
not
discrimination
against
the
railroad
because
it
takes
the
form
of
a
tax
exemption?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
once
you
say
that,
your
argument
that
exemptions
can't
count
as
discrimination
is
destroyed,
because
you
are
conceding
that
an
exemption
can
constitute
discrimination.
