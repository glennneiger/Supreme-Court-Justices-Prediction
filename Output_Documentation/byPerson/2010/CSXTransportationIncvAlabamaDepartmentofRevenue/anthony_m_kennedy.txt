anthony
m.

but
in
light
of
our
afc
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
are
arguing
is
that
the
statute
--
the
effect
of
your
argument
is
that
the
statute
gives
more
protection
in
the
case
of
non-property
taxes
than
property
taxes,
and
that's
an
--
an
odd
reading
of
the
statute,
which
is
directed
primarily
to
the
--
to
the
property
tax.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
this
case
--
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
off-road
users,
agricultural
users,
and
construction
and
timber
companies--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--have
the
same
--
have
the
same
tax
structure
as
the
railroads.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
is
an
objective
reference,
neutral,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
just
quite
rational
to
put
the
railroads
there
and
not
in
the
category
of
road
--
road
users.
now,
if
--
unless
you
are
arguing
the
discrimination
has
to
have
--
has
to
have
a
purposive
component.
that
might
give
you
a
different
case.
i'm
not
sure
you
prevail
on
that,
either.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
a
--
suppose
a
tax
were
structured
so
that
the
same
tax
applied
to
railroads
and
--
and
--
and
motor
transport,
but
because
of
the
way
the
tax
was
assessed,
the
railroads
paid
far
more
per
mile
than
--
than
the
--
than
the
road
transport.
could
the
railroad
then
come
in
and
say:
oh,
we
want
to
be
like
the
farmers;
we
are
off-road?
i
mean,
i
can
see
you
making
that
argument--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
case
--
in
case
number
two,
welcome
back.
that's
going
to
be
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
present
the
case
to
us
as
if
it's
either/or:
that
we
must
either
in
disagreement
with
your
position,
to
say
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
exemptions;
or
if
it
applies
to
exemptions,
it
must
be
remanded.
can
we
say
that
the
exemptions
are
not
covered
by
the
act
unless
the
railroad
is
a
target
of
an
--
an
isolated
target
and
it's
clear
that
it's
discriminatory?
i
mean,
do
we
have
to
have
your
either/or
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
may
be
because
the
universe
of
non-property
taxes
is
--
so
infinitely
large
that
there's
a
much
greater
room
for
--
a
much
great
danger
of
discrimination.
we
know
all
states
have
property
taxes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
you
need
to
give
us
a
test,
and
the
test
is
whether
or
not
the
railroad
is
singled
out
as
a
target
group
for
discrimination.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
something
like
that
--
for
discrimination,
something
like
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
authority
do
you
have
for
the
proposition
that
the
clear
statement
rule
applies
to
the
exercise
of
the
congressional
power
under
the
commerce
clause?
is
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--some
general
rule
that
we've
always
had?
