justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
concern
was
that
the
interstate
actors
should
not
be
disadvantaged
vis-a-vis
the
home
people,
the
local
businesses,
and
that
was
what
was
achieved.
but
you're
--
you
are
not
complaining
about
discrimination
against
a
railroad
in
comparison
to
local
businesses.
you
--
you
are
complaining
about
that
you
are
not
getting
most-favored-nations
treatment
vis-a-vis
other
interstate
carriers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips,
are
you
saying
that
the
--
the
railroads
have
to
be
taxed
in
the
very
same
way
as,
say,
the
--
the
trucks?
because
one
answer
to
your
argument
is:
well,
they
haven't
created
a
non-tax
situation
for
the
other
interstate
carriers;
they
are
just
subject
to
a
different
tax.
the
motor
carriers
have
to
pay
motor
fuel
tax.
so
are
you
saying
to
the
state
about
that,
you
have
to
have
the
same
sales
tax,
use
tax,
for
everyone;
you
can't
have
a
motor
fuel
tax
for
one
and
sales
tax
for
the
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
does
the
course
for
the
court
--
taking
account
of
what
you
said,
that
the
provision
about
other
taxes
came
out
very
late
in
the
day
--
they
had
spent
a
lot
of
time
talking
about
the
property
tax.
and
the
property
tax,
we
know,
they
wanted
to
preserve
the
exemptions.
so
why
not
take
this
latecomer
of
thought
or
discussion
and
say:
well,
we'll
assume
that
they
want
to
treat
that
with
regard
to
exemptions
the
same
way
that
they
treated
property
tax,
which
was
the
big-ticket
item.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
justice
kagan
meant
to
ask,
assuming
that
we
say
yes,
it
--
it
applies;
exemptions
don't
count
--
are
included
in
whether
there
is
discrimination,
and
the
court
finds
discrimination
between
the
way
the
railroad
is
taxed
and
the
way
motor
carriers
are
taxed,
what
--
what
then?
what
is
the
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
without
--
without
putting
on
--
i
mean,
the
motor
carriers
do
have
the
tax.
