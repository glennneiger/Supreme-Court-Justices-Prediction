mr.
corey
l.
maze
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
kennedy,
you
hit
on
the
proper
definition
of
a
tax
that
discriminates
in
this
case.
a
tax
that
discriminates
under
(b)(1),
(2),
and
(3)
is
a
tax
that
singles
out
railroads
as
compared
to
the
general
mass
of
taxpayers.
so
another
tax
that
discriminates
is
a
tax
that
singles
out
railroads
as
compared
to
the
general
mass
of
taxpayers.
the
pivotal
question
in
this
case
is
the
one
raised
by
justice
kagan
and
justice
scalia,
and
that
is:
why
in
the
world
would
congress,
on
the
one
hand,
say
you
can
exempt
property
taxes
under
this
statute,
but
you
can't
--
you
--
we
are
prohibiting
sales
and
use
tax
exemptions,
when
for
15
years
congress
never
had
a
single
hearing,
a
single
study,
and
never
even
heard
a
single
complaint
from
the
railroads
about
discriminatory
sales
and
use
taxes?
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
but
again,
i
think
the
answer
is
what
justice
ginsberg
was
pointing
out,
that
we
would
say
the
united
states
and
csx
still
has
not
come
up
with
a
good
reason.
they
basically
said
--
the
united
states
said,
you
just
look
at
the
statute
and
it
tells
a
different
story.
there
are
three
good
reasons
that
congress
would
have
intended,
and
the
court
should
read
property
tax
exemptions
and
non-property
tax
exemptions
to
be
read
the
same
way,
and
the
first
one
is
the
one
that
justice
ginsberg
was
pointing
out:
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
protect
out-of-state,
interstate
businesses
from
being
easy
prey
in
the
state
legislature.
they
don't
have
voting
power.
but
if
you
put
an
interstate
business
in
the
generally
applicable
tax
scheme,
that
means
they
are
paying
the
same
tax
as
the
local
businesses
and
local
taxpayers.
they
are
protected.
if
the
tax
rate
goes
up,
the
local
businesses,
the
local
taxpayers,
will
protect
them.
if
too
many
exemptions
occur,
the
local
taxpayers
and
the
local
businesses
will
protect
them.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
yes.
i
definitely
agree,
as
an
abstract
matter,
an
exemption
could
be
a
tax
that
discriminates.
but
what
congress
has
told
us
in
(1)
through
(3)
with
regard
to
property
taxes
is
you
can
grant
an
exemption,
and
congress
didn't
want
to
--
and
they
also
told
us--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
my--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
well,
i
would
say
that
congress
wasn't
even
thinking
about
non-property
tax
exemptions
when
they
wrote
before.
but
the
answer
is:
our
argument
is
to
say
that
we
understand
from
the
structure
of
the
statute
as
a
whole
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
preempt
the
state's
ability
to
issue
tax
exemptions.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
no,
because
they
are
paying
a
generally
applicable
4
percent
tax.
again,
remember,
in
the
property
tax--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--i'm
giving
the
meaning
the
same
meaning
that
the
court
suggested
in
acf;
that
is,
(b)(4)
is
a
tax.
another
tax
that
discriminates
is
one
that
singles
out
the
railroads.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
i'm
saying
that
a
tax
that
in
effect,
in
the
end,
singles
out
the
railroads
because
they
are
the
only
ones
that
pay
it;
that
would
be
discrimination.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
well,
then
again,
the
tax
wouldn't
be
generally
applicable.
this
is
what
the
court
went
over
in
acf.
in
this
case,
the
parties
agreed--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--no.
actually,
you
are
not
supposed
to
look
at
the
exemptions
at
all.
if
you
think
about
property
taxes,
when
you
have
a
generally
applicable
property
tax,
exemptions
are
removed
from
the
comparison
class.
all
you
are
looking
at
are
the
businesses
that
pay
the
tax.
in
that
case,
as
long
as
the
businesses
that
pay
the
tax
are
paying
the
same
rate--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--well,
again,
i
would
say
that
you
use
the
phrase
--
see,
i
know
that
singling
out
is
not
the
best
answer,
but
the
lower
courts
have
looked
at
it.
we
have
seen
cases
where
even
80
percent
--
as
long
as
20
percent
of
the
businesses
in
the
state
are
paying
it,
it's
generally
applicable.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
because
congress
understood
that
exemptions
for
individual
businesses--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--if
you
are
given
a
rate
difference,
a
benefit
of
any
kind
to
an
individual
business,
congress
understood
that
that
is
important
to
the
state.
let's
say,
for
example,
we
had
a
business
who's
has
had
an
economic
crisis
or
we
want
to
bring
a
new
business
into
the
state.
congress
understood
that
is
important
to
the
state
tax
policy.
the
point
of
the
statute
was
simply
to
put
the
railroads
on
equal
footing.
again,
if
you
think
back
to
property
taxes,
we
can
treat
trucks
however
we
want
to.
we
could
exempt
them.
we
can
treat
them
at
a
different
rate.
as
long
as
the
railroads
are
paying
an
equal
rate
to
the
general
mass,
it's
not
discrimination.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
can
you
explain
the
classes
again?
mr.
corey
l.
maze
no.
again,
in
that
instance,
like
the
court
said
in
acf,
that
would
be
a
case
in
which
the
railroads
had
been
singled
out,
because
only
two
businesses
were
paying
the
tax.
one
has
been
exempted;
then
the
railroads
are
only
one
left
paying
it.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
at
that
point,
as
the
court
said
in
acf,
it's
not
an
exemption
scheme
anymore.
at
this
point,
it's
just
a
tax
on
the
railroads.
again,
there
is
no
reason
in
the
text
or
the
structure
or
the
history
of
the
act
to
treat
property
taxes
any
differently
than
sales
and
use
taxes.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
yes.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
and
that's
the
test
that
just
judge
posner
gave
in
the
acf
case.
that's
the
test
that
the
court
suggested
in
acf.
that's
the
test
that
the
eleventh
circuit
used
here.
you
know,
one
of
the
problems--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--the
test
is
--
as
long
as
it
is
a
generally
applicable
tax
that
does
not
single
out
or
target
the
railroads,
it
is
not
subject
to
challenge.
in
fact,
the
court--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--you
mean
how
small
the
business
is
that
is
actually
paying
the
tax?
mr.
corey
l.
maze
that's
a
question
for
the
court
--
excuse
me,
choked.
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
court,
yes.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
but
it's
the
same
test.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
no.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
no.
the
question
presented
precisely
is
whether
a
state's
exemptions
of
rail
carrier
competitors,
but
not
rail
carriers,
from
a
generally
applicable
sales
and
use
tax.
in
this
case,
we've
already
presumed
that
the
fact
has
been
established
that
this
a
generally
applicable
tax.
the
eleventh
circuit
has
already
made
that
determination.
csx
and
the
united
states
agree
with
it.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
it
is
generally
applicable.
the
only
question
is:
under
the
test
we
have
just
articulated,
does
it
single
out
the
railroads?
everybody
agrees
it's
a
generally
applicable
tax.
thus,
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
cannot
be
another
tax
that
discriminates.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
i
think
inherently
you
have
to
understand
what
another
tax
that
discriminates
is
before
you
can
say
whether
something
is
subject
to
challenge
as
another
tax
that
discriminates.
one
of
justice
scalia's
points
earlier
was
to
mr.
phillips,
there
is
no
limiting
principle
if
you
treat
property
tax
exemptions
differently
than
non-property
taxes,
and
not
only
can
they
change
the
comparison
class,
the
railroads
do.
they
will
argue
against
the
states'
different
comparison
classes.
take
justice
kennedy's
example:
if
the
local
farmers
are
exempt,
they
would
argue
that
that
is
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce;
again,
the
phrase
congress
used
to
bind
the
four
together.
we've
had
cases
at
the
same
time
that
burlington
northern
was
arguing
the
diesel
fuel
cases
on
an
interstate
competitor
class.
they
turned
around
at
the
same
time
in
wyoming
and
argued
that
a
coal
transportation
tax
is
discriminatory
because
it
singled
them
out
versus--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--sure.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
and,
again,
if
we
adopt
a
test,
which
we
believe
is
the
right
test,
the
eleventh
circuit
has
already
done
it
in
this
case.
this
would
be
a
question
for
another
case.
again,
there
is
no
more
generally
applicable
tax
than
alabama's
4
percent
sales
and
use
tax.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
here's
the
problem
the
state
has
with
that
--
and
you
almost
channelled
what
mr.
phillips
said
earlier
--
that
we
leave
it
to
courts
to
determine
discrimination.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
well,
this
is
a
state
tax.
under
the
clear
statement
rule
--
we
detrimentally
rely
on
these
statutes
when
we
determine
whether
we
can
tax
someone
or
not.
now,
you
know,
if
the
courts
were
to
say,
you
can't
prospectively
tax
because
you
lose,
that's
one
thing,
but
we
have
taxed
the
railroads
for
years--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
and,
again,
that
would
be
the
test
that
we've
talked
about--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--and
--
and,
again,
the
problem
we
would
have
with
that
is
now
you
are
going
to
have
two
different
definitions
of
what
another
tax
that
discriminates
in
(b)(4)
for
property
taxes,
which
csx
agreed
applies
to
property
taxes--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--csx
argues
on
page
8
and
9
of
the
reply
brief
that
with
regard
to
property
taxes
(b)(4)
would
apply
if
the
tax
singles
out
the
railroads.
but
now
they
are
arguing
another
tax
that
discriminates,
the
very
same
phrase
means
any
differential
treatment
of
any
kind
when
it
comes
to
non-property
taxes.
to
agree
that
the
test
would
be
different
is
not
only
not
clearly
required
by
the
statute,
it
would
be
illogical,
because
what
happens
is,
you
can
have
an
infinitely
broad
definition
of
discriminate.
any
treatment
that
we
do
differently
for
non-property
taxes
is
discrimination,
which
not
only
does
it
make
note
--
the
most
favored
taxpayer,
they
might
as
well
be
considered
charities,
billion
dollar
charities.
we
could
--
we
could
never
tax
them
at
all,
because
we
exempt
someone
from
every
single
tax
we
levy.
for
example--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--yes.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
because
congress
didn't
clearly
put
in
the
statute
that
we
want
a
different
definition
for
discrimination
when
we
have
one.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
i
think
that
if
--
well,
first
of
all,
every
state
taxes
diesel,
at
least
for
truckers,
and
most
do
for
the
trains.
but
if
congress
was
thinking
about
this,
they
should
have
told
us
what
discriminate
means.
and
i
think
that
--
honestly,
i
think
we
should
go
across
the
street
and
have
them
tell
us.
but
--
but
they
are
not
here
and
what
we
are
saying
is
the
easiest
way
to
do
this
and
the
proper
way
to
do
it
is
simply
to
read
the
test
to
be
the
same
as
property
for
non-property
taxes.
if
the
test
is
single
out
railroads
when
you
are
talking
about
property
taxes,
it
should
be
the
same.
again,
the
point
would
be,
we
can't
tax
at
all
non-property
taxes,
at
all
if
the
definition
literally
is,
any
differential
treatment.
congress
never
would
have
intended
to
literally
prohibit
states
from
taxing--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--i
think
the
other
side
would
tell
you
that
we
can't
give
a
justification.
again,
(b)(1)(2)
and
(3)
are
absolutely--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--but
that
is
logically
what
would
happen.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
they
haven't
articulated
a
way
yet
from
preventing
that
from
happening.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
what
i
have
been
saying,
yes,
a
tax
doesn't
discriminate--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--i
--
i
would
have
no
problem
if
you
dismiss
it
improvidently
granted.
[laughter]
i
would
certainly
accept
that.
and,
again,
if
the
test
is
the
same,
the
eleventh
circuit
has
already
answered
the
question.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
the
--
the
statute
actually
does
use
the
word
"generally
applicable".
if
you
turn
to
page
25
of
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--well,
but
it
makes
a
good
point
in
the
original
version
of
(b)(3),
you
could
not
levy
a
tax
against
a
leveler
property
tax
at
a
tax
rate
higher
than
the
tax
rate
generally--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--right.
and
you
will
find
the
word
"discriminate"
at
the
beginning
of
each
of
these
section
as
well,
saying
each
of
these
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce,
meaning
they
all
discriminate
in
the
same
manner.
again,
if
you
think
about
it,
when
you
have
a
specific
provision
or
several
specific
provisions
followed
by
a
general,
you
have
to
give
some
independent
effect
to
the
specific
provision.
here's
the
problem
with
csx's
argument,
the
independent
effect
that
they
are
giving
(b)(1),
(2),
and
(3)
for
property
taxes
is
that
they
are
narrowing
the
prohibition
on
discriminatory
property
taxes
from
the
infinitely
broad
anything
goes
discrimination
test
for
all
property
taxes,
which
again
is
illogical
when
the
only
thing
congress
talked
about
for
15
years
was
discriminatory
property
taxes.
the
only--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--right.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
yes.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
textually
that's
a
problem
because
the
5
percent
in
it
only
applies
to
assessment
ratio
problems
in
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2),
and
the
rest--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--i
--
i
don't
think
at
that
point
the
courts
have
any
idea
what
they
can
do.
what
--
what
how
does
a
state
know
what
is
over
the
line
and
what's
not?
i
mean,
now
we
know
as
long
as
we
subject
them
to
our
generally
applicable
tax,
which
is
what
all
the
states
did
when
the
4-r
act
passed--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--it
simply
means
that
you
apply--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--because
i
know
that
everyone
who
pays
the
diesel
fuel
tax
pays
4
percent.
it
generally
applies
to
everyone.
a
--
a
problem
that
you
have
with
subsection
(c),
again,
and
that
the
united
states
and
csx
has
avoided
so
far
is
it
is
a
jurisdictional
problem,
and
it
has
been
raised
as
by
one
of
our
amici.
even
if
there
is
a
(b)(4)
violation,
which
we
obviously
don't
agree
that
there
is,
it
says
that
no
relief
can
be
granted
unless
have
you
an
assessment
value
problem
of
plus
or
5
minus
percent.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
well,
then
it
says
relief
can't
be
granted.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
the
problem
with
that
is
--
that
is
csx's
argument
--
is
now
you
are
reading
into
congress's
intent
for
the
statute
and
the
moment
you
open
up
to
what
congress's
intent
for
the
statute
is,
we
know
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
make
railroads
the
most
favored
taxpayers
in
any
way.
the
railroads
actually
said
that
themselves.
if
you
start
reading
intent
into
the
statute,
the
intent
was
simply
to
put
them
on
equal
footing.
so
you
would
have
to
read
(b)(4)
to
say,
just
like
property
taxes,
and
non-property
taxes
as
long
as
they
are
subject
to
a
generally
applicable
tax
there
is
no
discrimination,
you
are
not
subject
to
challenge.
so
again,
i
don't
think
that
would
--
would
be
an
issue.
now
one
of
the
problems
i
see
that
the
court
has
is
this
fear
that
the
states
are
going
to
take
a
generally
applicable
tax
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
start
exempting
everyone.
let's
say,
for
example
the
state
of
alabama
sales
and
use
tax.
it's
not
going
to
happen
for
a
very
simple
reason.
our
sales
and
use
tax
funds
our
schools.
at
the
moment
we
start
exempting
every
single
business,
our
schools
don't
have
any
money.
we
are
not
going
to
pick
on
the
railroads
by
exempting,
exempting,
exempting,
exempting.
the
railroads,
quite
honestly,
can't
fund
our
schools.
we
are
having
a
hard
enough
time
funding
them
as
it
is,
and
we
are
not
going
to
just
target
railroads
by
exemption.
so
i
see
that
the
court
might
have
a
problem
understanding
what's
the
line
with
exemptions,
but
it's
just
never
going
to
happen.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right.
but
--
but--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--again,
because
congress
understood
that
exemptions
are
a
--
an
integral
part
of
the
state's
tax
policy.
we
need
to
be
able
to
give
exemptions
to
individual
businesses.
this
is--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--no.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
right,
because
that's
the
way
it
works
for
property
taxes.
let
me
be
very
clear
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
hold.
on
page
335
of
acf,
this
is
what
the
court
held
in
that
case:
a
state
may
grant
exemptions
from
a
generally
applicable
ad
valorem
property
tax
without
subjecting
the
taxation
of
railroad
property
to
challenge
under
(b)(4).
all
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
in
this
case
is
substitute
three
words.
ad
valorem
property
is
out;
sales
and
use
tax
is
in.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language,
the
structure
or
history
of
the
act
that
would
suggest,
much
less
clearly
and
manifestly
mandate,
which
is
necessary
under
the
clear
statement
rule,
that
that
rule
should
be
any
different.
again,
it
would
be
illogical
because
it
would
be
illogical
to
think
that
congress
spent
15
years
worried
about
one
problem
and
that
problem
is,
is
the
states
were
discriminating
in
property
taxes.
but
there
is
one
clear,
easy
way
to
see
that
the
railroads
didn't
really
believe
that
this
was
a
clear
statement
against
generally
applicable
sales
and
use
taxes.
the
point
was
made
earlier,
the
railroads
will
sue
us
all
of
the
time
to
save
money.
it's
very
telling
that
the
railroads
didn't
sue
any
state,
despite
we
have
been
taxing
this
way
since
the
1930s,
until
the
late
80s
or
early
90s
under
this
theory,
because
even
they
when
they
read
this
statute,
understood
it
to
mean
only
if
we
are
singled
out
or
targeted.
that's
the
way
they
litigated
(b)(4)
for
the
first
decade.
it's
only
when
they
couldn't
win
those
cases
any
more
that
they
changed
what
they
believed
it
meant.
but
the
fact
that
this
was
able
--
again
sales
and
use
taxes
is
their
most
expensive
tax.
and
as
they
say
in
the
--
in
the
norfolk
southern
opinion,
the
third
largest
expenditure
of
the
railroads
is
diesel
fuel.
if
the
third
largest
expenditure
of
the
railroads
is
out
there
to
be
taken
away
--
the
taxes,
they
certainly
would
have
sued
us
within
the
first
10
years
if
this
statute
clearly
said
we
couldn't
do
it.
but
nobody
believed
that
is
what
the
statute
said,
because
congress
never
said
it
in
the
entire
15-year
history.
the
statute
itself
when
you
read
it
doesn't
say
it.
just
as
the
court
said
in
acf,
this
statute
is
at
best
vague
on
the
point
of
tax
exemptions.
and
in
that
case,
under
the
clear
statement
rule,
you
have
to
defer
to
the
state.
congress
needs
to
tell
us
specifically
what
we
can
and
can't
do.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
a--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--acf
actually
applied
the
clear
statement
rule,
not
only
said
it
applied,
it
said
it
compelled
the
ruling
in
this
case.
the
--
i'm
sorry,
i've
got
the
page
number?
in
acf,
you
said
it
was
--
sorry
--
i
drew
a
blank
all
of
a
sudden.
regardless,
it's
in
acf,
the
court
said
that
--
i'm
sorry,
it's
page
345
of
acf.
the
court
said
--
"absent
unambiguous
evidence"
was
one
of
the
quotes,
and
then
at
the
end
it
said,
you
have
to
show
congress's
clear
and
manifest
purpose;
and
the
court
said
because
you
can't
see
a
clear
and
manifest
purpose,
because
there
is
no
unambiguous
evidence
--
again,
because
the
statute
doesn't
talk
about
tax
exemptions
at
all.
mr.
corey
l.
maze
absolutely.
we
have
been
doing
it
since
the
1930s.
as
you'll
see
in--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--because
federal
law
makes
us
do
it.
federal
law
taxes
diesel
fuel
differently
on
road,
and
they
makes
us
--
die
--
fuel
off-road.
and
because
they're
taxed
differently
at
the
federal
level,
the
states
have
had
to
adopt
it.
in
fact
the
hayden-cartwright
act
up
until
the
1980s
forced
us
to
do
so.
so
we
have
been
doing
this
since
the
1930s.
congress
obviously
knew
we
were
doing
it
when
we
wrote
the
"four
r"
act.
and
yet
nobody
ever
complained.
congress
knew
exactly--
mr.
corey
l.
maze
--thank
you.
