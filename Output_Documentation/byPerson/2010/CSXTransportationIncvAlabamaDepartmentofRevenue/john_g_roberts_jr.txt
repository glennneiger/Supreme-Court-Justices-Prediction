roberts,

we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-520,
csx
transportation
v.
the
alabama
department
of
revenue.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
ms.
sherry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
well,
but
in
any
case
when
you
have
discrimination,
you
can
remedy
it
by
reducing
the
tax,
for
example,
in
this
case
on
the
railroad
or
by
increasing
the
tax
on
the
people
who
are
otherwise
exempt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
decision
that
i
suppose
would
be
left
at
some
point
or
another
up
to
the
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
discriminary
--
the
discriminary
portion
of
the
tax
may
be
regarded
as
the
excess
that
is
imposed
on
the
railroad
or
the
deficiency
on
--
on
the
others.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
the
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
don't
even
try.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
maze.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
can
single
out
the
railroads
through
exemptions.
i
mean,
let's
say
you
have
a
tax
of
$1,000
per
mile
per
day
for
anything
that
uses
a
thoroughfare
in
the
state.
however,
things
that
use
roads,
waterways,
you
know,
the
long
list
that
in
effect
leaves
only
the
railroads
exposed.
you
are
saying
that
can't
be
regarded
as
a
tax
that
discriminates
against
the
railroads?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
what
if
there's
only
two
that
pay
it?
only
--
and
it
applies
only
to
railroads
and
bicycles?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
can
determine
that
a
tax
is
not
generally
applicable
based
on
the
exemptions.
if
everybody
else
is
exempt,
well,
it's
not
generally
applicable.
if
just
bicycles
are
also
exempt,
then
it
is
not
generally
applicable.
we
have
to
look
at
the
exemptions
to
decide
whether
there
is
discrimination.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
just
so
i
follow:
and
that
test
says
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sure
i'm
just
repeating
mysself
here.
so
that
it
doesn't
single
it
out
if
there's
one
additional
business
or
line
of
business
subject
to
the
tax,
no
matter
how
small
that
exemption
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
so
the
court
has
to
decide,
even
when
you
are
dealing
with
exemptions,
whether
or
not
that
discriminates
against
the
railroad?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i'm
right,
that
means
you
lose
the
case--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--at
least
as
the
question
presented
has
been
addressed,
because
all
we
are
deciding
--
i
understand
you
think
we
ought
to
decide
more,
but
all
we
are
deciding
is:
can
(b)(4)
ever
come
into
play
when
the
discrimination
arises
from
an
exemption?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
railroads
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
still
doesn't
get
to
the
question
that
in
courts
in
each
particular
case
will
be
able
to
decide,
even
under
your
test,
whether
it
singles
out
railroads.
the
only
question
i
have
is
that
whether
singling
out
means
railroads
have
to
be
the
only
business
subject
to
it,
or
if
it
has
to
be,
you
know,
some
theory
--
justice
kennedy
was
looking
for
a
test.
i
don't
know
if
we
have
got
a
workable
one
--
to
decide
when
it's
really
discriminating
against
the
railroad
and
when
it's
that
the
exceptions
are
just
the
way
taxes
normally
work.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
section
11501(c)
is
relevant
to
all
these
disputes,
because
one
thing
11501(c)
does
is
give
the
state
a
little
bit
of
a
break?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
recognize
that
it
is
hard
to
have
exact
equality
in
terms
of
ad
valorem
property
assessment.
so,
what
does
--
what
does
it
say
--
you
know,
a
5
percent
legal
room.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
couldn't
you,
if
we
rule
against
you,
when
you
get
back
and
other
state
officials
say,
look,
the
one
thing
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
is
being
precise.
we
have
got
some
legal
room,
so
we
can
exempt
the
85-year-old
widow,
we
can,
you
know,
exempt
the
farm
property.
we
just
kind
of
have
to
get
it
close
so
that
if
somebody
looks
at
it,
and
they'll
say,
well,
it
doesn't
really
look
like
they
are
discriminating
against
railroads,
why
isn't
that
pertinent
and
why
doesn't
it
respond
to
a
lot
of
your
concerns?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know.
i'm
using
that
not
as
saying
that
this
is
applicable
to
(b)(4),
but
that
it
gives
you
an
idea
that
congress
didn't
have
the
precise
absolute
rule,
and
you
go
one,
you
know,
1
inch
over
the
line
and
you
are
in
trouble.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
clearly
--
it
clearly
applies
to
(b)(1)
through
(3)
and
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
(b)(4)
because
it
can't
apply
to
(b)(4).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
(b)(4)
is
not
a
--
(b)(4),
the
whole
point
is
if
it's
not
a
property
tax,
you
don't
have
ad
valorem
assessments,
so
the
details
limiting
jurisdiction
when
you
do
have
ad
valorem
taxes
don't
apply
to
this
case
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips,
counsel.
case
