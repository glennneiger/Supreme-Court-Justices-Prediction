justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
aren't
--
isn't
punishment
and
rehabilitation
often
flip
sides
of
each
other?
if
you
read
what
the
judge
said
here,
his
comment
was
this
man
--
or
this
woman,
i'm
sorry,
has
been
involved
in
a
series
--
escalating
series
of
serious
offenses.
logically,
she
has
to
be
put
away
for
a
long
time
unless
she
gets
rehabilitation
because
there's
going
to
be
no
deterrence
otherwise.
and
so,
what
the
judge
was
basically
saying,
in
my
judgment
--
and
i
don't
know
why
it's
not
just
the
flip,
which
is
without
--
without
drug
treatment,
we
can't
deter
her.
and
so,
this
crime,
given
her
background,
deserves
this
kind
of
sentence.
one
of
its
by-products
is
a
drug
treatment
program.
how
different
is
that,
or
do
you
really
think
that
a
judge
who
knows
that
someone
is
going
to
get
a
rehab
program
if
they
serve
50
months
and
the
sentencing
range
is
between
45
and
55,
do
you
think
that
they're
going
to
take
50
--
they're
not
going
to
choose
50
if
they
understand
that
there's
no
chance
for
this
person
to
be
deterred
without
drug
treatment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
wait
a
minute.
that's
the
whole
point,
because
what
the
judge
said
was
if
she
doesn't
get
treatment,
she
needs
to
be
in
jail
a
long
time
because
her
crime
was
serious,
because
she's
just
going
to
continue
committing
crimes.
there's
a
chance
if
she
gets
it
that
she
won't,
but
without
it,
for
sure,
she's
not,
and
this
is
the
just
punishment
she
deserves,
this
amount
of
years.
that's
how
i
read
the
transcript.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you're
ignoring
his
lengthy
discussion
talking
about
she
was
really
going
down
the
wrong
road
here.
i
understand
her
troubled
past.
she
gets
involved
in
alien
smuggling,
which
is
very
serious.
he
is
talking
at
length
about
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
so
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
if
what
we
see
is
a
judge
who's
talking
about
a
flip
situation,
i.e.,
you
need
to
punish
strongly
because
the
crimes
are
serious,
and
an
added
benefit
is
rehabilitation,
why
does
that
violate
3582?
what
about
3582,
in
using
the
word
"recognizing",
stops
a
judge
from
saying
without
something
there's
going
to
be
no
deterrence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
talking
only
about
when
rehabilitation
is
the
primary
purpose?
so
the
issue
here
is
what
was
the
judge's
primary
purpose?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
now
we
want
some
talismanic
words
where
the
judge
says
what
i
said?
this
crime
is
so
serious
that
the
sentence
should
be
x
amount,
and
now
talismanically
i'll
say
rehab
is
just
a
side
effect,
really
the
sentence
is
motivated
by
--
completely
by
punishment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
can
a
judge
who
believes
a
defendant
is
dangerous
to
the
public
and
thinks
that
that
danger
can't
be
abated
without
a
drug
treatment
program,
could
the
judge
nevertheless
under
3553(a)(2)(c)
say,
because
of
the
danger
to
the
public,
i'm
going
to
lengthen
the
sentence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
in
the
hopes
that
a
drug
rehabilitation
program
will
be
available?
i
don't
care
if
it
is
or
it's
not;
this
person's
dangerous
to
the
community
otherwise?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
different
than
what
the
judge
did
here,
where
he
talked
about,
explicitly,
on
page
26,
"it
has
to
deter"
--
the
sentence
has
to
deter
criminal
conduct
by
others,
and
it
has
to
protect
the
public
from
further
crimes
of
the
defendant,
and
the
sentence
--
that's
a
big
factor
here,
given
her
failure
to
appear
and
what
she
did
out
on
bail.
so,
if
the
sentence
has
a
dual
motive,
is
that
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
i
know
that
you're
--
there's
--
there's
an
issue
about
whether
this
transcript
can
be
read
as
a
dual
motive
or
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
my
question
is,
is
a
dual-motive
sentence
permissible?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
that
what
"dual
motive"
means?
unless--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
want
talismatic
words.
i
would
have
picked
the
sentence
anyway.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
articulate
an
interpretation
of
this
provision
that
would
guide
appellate
review?
if
rehabilitation
can
always
be
a
factor,
then
when
and
how
does
a
court
of
appeals
determine
whether
a
judge
has
abused
his
or
her
discretion?
you
said
5
years,
if
the
guideline
range
presumably
is
24
months
and
the
judge
adds
5
years.
but
how
do
you
define
that?
the
simple
answer
is
if
the
judge
is
imposing
the
sentence
because
of
rehabilitation,
they
can't
do
that.
is
that
what
you're
arguing
or
are
you
arguing
they
can
do
it
except
within
a
range?
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
how
far
you're
going.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
this
makes
a
lot
of
sense
when
we're
talking
about
huge
disparities
in
a
guideline
sentence,
versus
one
where
the
judge
goes
outside
the
guidelines
or
imposes
a
greater
sentence
than
otherwise
the
guidelines
would
determine
for
rehabilitation
purposes.
but
not
infrequently
guideline
ranges
are
within
very
narrow
scopes,
and
in
fact
there
are
some
prison
advantages
that
you
get
from
being
sentenced
to
a
year
and
a
day
that
you
don't
get
if
you're
sentenced
to
12
months;
and
district
courts
routinely
will
choose
between
a
year
and
a
day
or
12
months
based
on
knowledge
about
what
might
be
available
if
you're
there
for
over
a
year.
why
is
that
wrong?
what
would
be
the
difference?
you
see,
i'm
having
a
hard
time
in
this
case,
because
if
a
judge
comes
in
and
says
guideline
range
is
50
to
60,
i
think
in
the
middle
is
perfectly
fine,
i
just
don't
know
whether
i
should
give
him
54
or
55
months,
but
i
know
that
at
55
months
there's
this
kind
of
program
available.
i'm
going
to
do
--
i'm
going
to
--
you
know,
it
is
--
judging
is
not
so
precise
that
you
know
exactly
where
to
go
within
the
small
ranges,
and
so
there
are
many
factors
that
influence
that
decision.
why
should
we
announce
a
rule
that
says
to
a
judge
in
those
situations,
don't
give
him
that
extra
month?
