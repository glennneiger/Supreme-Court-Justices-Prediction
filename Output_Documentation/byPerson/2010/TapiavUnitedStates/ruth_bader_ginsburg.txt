but
it
is
strange,
isn't
it,
that
they
can
take
rehabilitation
into
account
for
the
supervised
release.
i
mean,
that
--
that's
a
provision,
isn't
it?
as
far
as
supervised
release
is
concerned,
the
judge
can
take
account
of
rehabilitation
in
setting
the
length
of
the
term,
but
can't
do
that
for
the
prison
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
how
do
we--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
we
know
that
when
the
government
--
didn't
the
government
ask
for
63
months?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
judge
came
up
with
something
in
between
those
two?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
prisons
have
multiple
treatment
programs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
have
vocational
treatment.
do
you
--
are
you
relying
at
all
on
the
fact
that
in
the
supervised
release
term,
the
judge
can
say
this
man
or
this
woman
needs
rehabilitation,
and
i
want
this
program
for
her,
but
in
the
prison
setting,
the
judge,
this
judge
--
as
the
colloquy
with
justice
scalia
showed,
this
judge
wanted
her
to
be
in
the
program,
but
she
never
got
into
it
because
the
judge
has
no
control?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
could
follow
your
argument
much
better
if
the
judge
could
say
that
this
specialized
program
--
as
i
am
making
that
a
term
of
your
incarceration.
the
disturbing
factor
about
your
argument
is
the
judge
can
only
recommend;
the
judge
has
no
way
of
making
sure
that
this
person
will
be
in
prison
longer
and
get
the
treatment
the
--
the
judge
wants,
because
the
judge
can't
control
where
the
person
will
serve
her
sentence
and
what
treatment
will
be
available
for
her.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
something
--
you
responded
that
she
didn't
--
she
said
i'd
rather
not.
but
wasn't
there
something
about
placing
her
with
--
in
the
same
facility
as
another
inmate?
wasn't
that
involved?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
your
proposal
lead
to
unevenness
in
sentencing?
if
you
--
if
you're
right,
then
this
choice
of
extending
a
term
to
accommodate
a
drug
program,
that
could
be
--
the
judge
would
have
the
option.
i
think
nearly
half
of
the
people
who
are
incarcerated
have
a
drug
addiction.
so
one
judge
might
say:
i'm
not
going
to
let
that
person
out
until
they
--
they
should
at
least
have
a
chance
to
get
into
this
program.
and
another
will
say:
i
can't
control
that;
i'm
not
going
to
subject
--
you
would
be
introducing
that,
just
what
the
framers
of
the
reform
act
were
trying
to
get
away
from,
that
this
swings
from
one
judge
to
another,
and
you're
dealing
with
almost
half
the
prison
population.
