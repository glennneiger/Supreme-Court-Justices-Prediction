anthony
m.

you
have,
in
effect,
a
one-way
ratchet.
if
the
judge
really
thinks
rehabilitation
is
a
--
a
--
a
primary
or
an
important
component
of
the
sentence,
then
it
reduces
the
prison
term.
it
could
never
increase
it.
so
you
have
a
one-way
ratchet.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
--
suppose
the
case
in
which
the
judge
is
going
to
sentence
to
2
years
no
matter,
but
there
is
a
2-year
rehabilitation
program,
and
the
defendant
is
--
the
prisoner
is
receiving
that.
would
you
say
that,
at
that
point,
the
prisoner
is
receiving
an
imprisonment
term
and
rehabilitation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
hypothetical.
the
term
isn't
affected
by
the
program,
but
the
judge
recommends
the
program,
and
the
prisoner
is
receiving
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
agree
the
prisoner
is
then
receiving
both
an
imprisonment
term
and
rehabilitation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
so
then,
we
can
use
those
two
goals
of
sentencing
in
--
in
the
conjunctive--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
you
can
have
imprisonment
and
rehabilitation
at
the
same
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
just
talking
about
a
matter
of
diction.
you
would
agree
there
are
instances,
in
a
hypothetical--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--case,
where
you
can
receive
imprisonment
and
rehabilitation
at
same
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
--
we're
talking
about
what
the
statute
says,
and
the
question
indicates,
the
hypothetical
indicates,
that
those
are
not
mutually
exclusive.
you
can
have
imprisonment
and
rehabilitation
at
same
time.
now,
this
case
is
a
little
different
because
she
didn't
get
it,
but
let's
just
talk
about
the
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
judge
said:
i'm
going
to
sentence
you
to
12
months.
now,
there
is
a
particular
facility
where
there
is
a
drug
treatment
program
that
you
can
really
benefit
from,
and
you'd
be
a
safer
citizen,
but
i'm
not
going
to
mix
up
imprisonment
and
rehabilitation.
i'm
not
even
going
to
make
that
--
i'm
not
going
to
consider
it.
all
i'm
interested
in
is
imprisonment.
is
that
an
abuse
of
discretion?
the
failure
to
consider
the
factors
that
congress
set
forth,
including
rehabilitation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
he
said
i
--
no,
he
said
i'm
not
going
to
consider
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
--
so
then
he
must
consider
rehabilitation
in
the
context
of
imprisonment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
--
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
principal
trouble
i
have
with
your
argument
is
that,
as
justice
scalia
mentioned,
the
judge
can't
be
certain
that
the
treatment
will
--
will
be
provided.
and
in
an
answer
to
an
earlier
question
you
said,
well,
90
percent
of
the
time
the
judge's
recommendation
is
followed,
the
program
is
--
is
offered.
suppose
we're
only
10
percent
of
the
time?
suppose
only
10
percent
of
the
time
could
or
did
the
bureau
of
prisons
follow
the
judge's
recommendation,
wouldn't
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
then
be
very
difficult
to
sustain?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
still
find
it
hard,
if
i
were
going
to
write
the
opinion,
to
rule
for
your
position
to
ignore
the
90
percent-10
percent
hypothetical
problem
i
have,
to
say,
well
now,
90
percent
of
the
time
the
judge's
rules
are
going
to
be
followed
or
the
judge's
recommendations
are
going
to
be
followed.
that's
an
odd
way
to
support
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
we
have
to
--
that
we
have
to
adopt
in
order
to
rule
in
your
favor
because,
as
i
say,
suppose
his
position,
his
recommendation,
were
followed
only
10
percent
of
the
time?
