justice
samuel
a.
alito,

do
you
think
that's
--
do
you
think
that's
consistent
with
what
congress
thought
about
rehabilitation
when
it
adopted
the
sentencing
reform
act?
and
you
discuss
their
thinking,
and
i
think
accurately,
in
your
brief,
but
was
their
thinking
simply
that
rehabilitation
is
very
feasible
and
it's
reasonably
predictable
whether
somebody
can
be
rehabilitated
or
has
been
rehabilitated
so
long
as
it's
done
outside
of
prison,
but
it
just
doesn't
work
in
prison?
was
that
their
thinking?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
only
one-half
of
what
the
thinking
was
at
the
time
about
rehabilitation.
the
thinking
was
that
--
that
some
people
were
being
sentenced
to
coercive
rehabilitation,
but
also
that
other
people
were
being
paroled
before
they
should
be
on
the
theory
that
they
had
been
rehabilitated.
it
was
a
general
skepticism
about
rehabilitation,
and
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
idea
that
you
can
take
rehabilitation
into
account
in
going
down,
but
you
can't
take
rehabilitation
into
account
in
going
up.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
but
that's
different
from
saying
that
a
lower
sentence
can
be
imposed
on
the
theory
that
with
rehabilitation
outside
of
prison,
a
lengthier
sentence
isn't
needed.
would
you
agree
that
when
the
guidelines
were
mandatory
a
judge
could
not
sentence
to
--
to
additional
time,
certainly
not
additional
time
outside
the
guideline
range
for
the
purpose
of
rehabilitation,
but
the
judge
also
generally
could
not
depart
below
the
guideline
range
on
the
theory
that
this
defendant
had
led
a
life
of
crime
because
the
defendant
lacked
vocational
skills
or
the
defendant
was
dependent
on
drugs
or
alcohol,
and
with
treatment
outside
of
incarceration,
those
problems
which
had
led
to
the
criminality
could
be
alleviated?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
judge
thinks
that
a
--
a
defendant
would
benefit
from
a
type
of
a
vocational
or
educational
training
that
may
be
available
in
prison
but
that
is
not
available
in
--
on
the
outside
in
the
particular
community
where
this
defendant
resides?
what
would
the
judge
do
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
what
if
that's
not--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
if
it's
not
available
in
the
community
on
the
outside?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
arguing
for
something
like
a
plain
statement
rule,
if
the
judge
says
plainly,
i'm
increasing
your
sentence
so
you
can
get
rehabilitation,
then
there's
a
problem?
or
would
there
possibly
be
situations
in
which
one
could
infer
that
the
desire
to
provide
for
rehabilitation
in
prison
had
influenced
the
sentence?
for
example,
choosing
a
sentence
that
is
just
long
enough
to
allow
somebody
to
take
advantage
of
a
particular
rehabilitation
program
in
a
--
in
a
prison,
or
where
the
judge
goes
on
and
on
and
on
about
the
need
for
rehabilitation
for
this
--
vocational
training
for
this
prisoner?
