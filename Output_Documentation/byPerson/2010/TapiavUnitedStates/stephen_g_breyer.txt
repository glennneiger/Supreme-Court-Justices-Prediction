justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
senate
report
says
that
the
provisions
we've
been
talking
about
make
clear
a
defendant
should
not
be
sent
to
prison
only
because
the
prison
has
a
program
that
might
be
good
for
him.
drug
dependence
in
the
committee's
view
generally
should
not
play
a
role
in
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
incarcerate
the
offender.
is
there
something
that
conflicts
with
that?
because
that
was
pretty
clear
indication
of
the
committee's
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
put
a
great
deal
of
weight
on
the
word
only.
i
guess
if
it's
a
dual
motive
we
don't
really
know
what
would
have
happened
in
the
absence
of
one
of
the
motives.
so
should
we
send
the
whole
thing
back
for
resentencing?
