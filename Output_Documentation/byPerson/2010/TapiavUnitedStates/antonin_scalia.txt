justice

so,
if
he
gave
her
extra
years
in
order
to
get
that
treatment,
he
just
gave
her
extra
years
without
the
treatment,
as
it
turned
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
judge
did
say,
didn't
he
--
this
is
on
page
27
of
the
joint
appendix
--
"the
sentence
has
to
be
sufficient
to
provide
needed
correctional
treatment,
and
here
i
think
the
needed
correctional
treatment
is
the
500-hour
drug
program.
"
it
couldn't
be
clearer
that
he's
computing
the
length
of
the
sentence
on
the
basis
of
what
correctional
treatment
will
be
received.
it
"has
to
be
sufficient
to
provide
needed
correctional
treatment.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you'd
say
it
was
wrong
for
the
district
court
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
whether
it
can
be
established
on
appeal
that
it
was
wrong
is
another
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
it
--
it
seems
to
me
what
the
statute
requires
is
that
he
consider
rehabilitation
in
imposing
the
sentence.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
in
imposing
imprisonment.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
can
consider
rehabilitation
in
deciding
what
this
person
will
be
required
to
do
in
--
in
a
probated
term,
but
not
in
how
long
he's
going
to
stay
in
prison
before
he
gets
probation.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
wouldn't
affect
the
length
of
the
sentence.
are
you
talking
about,
say,
can
the
judge
prescribe
that
he
be
incarcerated
in
a
particular
facility?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you
consider
that
that
solves
your
case,
that
that
makes
everything
okay.
she
refused
it.
she
would
not
have
been
able
to
refuse
it
had
it
been
made
a
condition
of
her
supervised
release.
you
either
take
the
program
or
you
go
back
to
jail.
i
mean,
that's
--
why
is
that
an
insignificant
difference?
the
fact
is
the
judge
has
no
control
over
whether
this
person
gets
the
rehabilitation
that
was
supposedly
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
extended
prison
term.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
makes
no
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
--
you're
not
responding
to
my
point.
you're
--
you're
--
you're
making
a
different
point.
i'm
saying
that
it's
--
it
--
it
--
it
does
not
help
your
case
that
the
reason
she
did
not
get
the
rehabilitative
treatment
that
this
judge
wanted
her
to
get
was
that
she
simply
refused
it.
why
does
that
help
your
case?
she
couldn't
have
refused
it
if,
as
the
other
side
says,
had
to
be
the
case,
he
had
imposed
this
rehabilitative
measure
as
a
portion
of
supervised
release.
then
she
would
have
had
to
take
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
read
the
--
the
crucial
provision
of
the
statute.
yes,
you
read
the
--
the
section
entitled
imposition
of
a
sentence,
but
there
is
another
provision
in
the
statute
which
says
imposition
of
a
sentence
of
imprisonment.
you
can
indeed
consider
those
factors
in
imposing
the
sentence,
which
includes
probation,
supervised
release
and
any
other
matters.
but
what
--
what
3582(a)
says
is
that
the
court
in
determining
whether
to
impose
a
--
whether
to
impose
a
term
of
imprisonment
as
opposed
to
just
parole
or
--
or
supervised
release,
and
if
a
term
of
imprisonment
is
to
be
imposed
and
determining
the
length
of
term
shall
consider
the
factors
set
forth
in,
that
you
mentioned
in
3553(a)
to
the
extent
they
are
recognizing
that
imprisonment
is
not
an
appropriate
means
of
promoting
correction
and
rehabilitation.
you
have
to
reconcile
the
two
sections.
and
the
way
to
reconcile
them
is
to
say
that
the
former
applies
to
sentencing
in
general
but
when
you're
dealing
with
the
length
of
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
or
whether
there
should
be
any
imprisonment
at
all,
you
cannot
consider
rehabilitation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
any
other
way
to
read
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
don't
know
what
else
recognizing
that
factor
would
consist
of,
except
you
won't
use
that
factor
in
deciding
imprisonment
or
length
of
term
of
imprisonment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
tell
me
what
it
means
here,
then.
what,
he
--
he
should
say,
you
know,
i
recognize
that
rehabilitation
is
not
a
--
an
appropriate
factor
to
take
into
account
in
determining
the
length
of
your
sentence
or
the
--
or
whether
you
should
go
to
jail
at
all.
that
said,
i'm
going
to
send
you
to
jail
in
order
to
rehabilitate
you.
[laughter]
is
that
all
it
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
judge
only
has
the
power
to
impose
imprisonment.
he
does
not
have
the
empower
to
impose
anything
else
during
the
imprisonment.
i
mean,
what
you're
saying
might
make
sense
if
indeed
he
could
prescribe
some
treatment
during
imprisonment,
but
he
can't.
there
are
prisons
--
and
why
can't
he,
by
the
way?
why
has
he
been
prevented
from
doing
that,
although
he's
allowed
to
do
it
during
supervised
release?
does
that
make
any
sense,
if
indeed,
as
you
say,
he
can
take
that
into
account
in
imprisonment?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
--
if
it
is
as
you
say,
why
--
why
did
congress
leave
it
up
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
decide
whether
this
person
can
enter
into
a
rehabilitation
program,
and
not
allow
the
judge
to
prescribe
that
the
person
will
enter
into
it?
why?
what
--
what
possible
sense
could
that
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
judges
can
prescribe
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
substantive
change,
they
can't
prescribe,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
was
it
not
a
change
that
the
judge
could
not
prescribe
a
certain
program
for
the
prisoner?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
a
change?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
would
they
have
that
change
if
the
statute
reads
the
way
you
say?
what
sense
does
it
make
to
still
allow
the
judge
to
take
this
into
account,
but
affirmatively
deprive
him
of
the
power
to
do
what
he
wanted
to
do?
