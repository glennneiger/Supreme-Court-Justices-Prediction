mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
it
instructed
courts
to
recognize
that
imprisonment
is
not
an
appropriate
means
of
promoting
correction
and
rehabilitation,
congress
intended
to
end
the
practice
of
sending
defendants
to
prison
so
that
they
might
get
treatment.
the
commands
of
3582
are
clear
on
this
point:
do
not
imprison
and
do
not
lengthen
prison
sentences
for
the
purposes
of
rehabilitation.
this
plain
meaning
is
confirmed
by
the
structure
of
the
statute.
under
the
statute,
judges
have
the
power
to
sentence
defendants
to
prison
but
not
to
prison
programs.
judges
once
had
that
power
under
the
youth
corrections
act
and
under
the
narcotic
addicts
rehabilitation
act.
with
the
sentencing
reform
act
congress
took
that
power
away.
that
structure
makes
sense
only
because
congress
intended
that
defendants
should
no
longer
be
sent
to
prison
for
purposes
of
rehabilitation.
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
that's
correct,
that
the
--
that
the
way
in
which
the
statute
is
set
up,
the
logic
of
3582
is
that
a
need
for
rehabilitation
can
push
the
judge,
the
sentencing
judge,
into
moving
the
individual
either
out
of
an
incarceration
sentence
into
probation
or
lower
the
sentence
to
get
that
individual
into
supervisory
release
where
rehabilitation
current
--
concerns
are
properly
addressed
under
the
statute.
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
well,
there's
relatively
little
evidence
of
what
congress
thought
about
the
possibility
of
rehabilitating
individuals
outside
of
prison.
what's
clear
is
that
they
doubted
that
rehabilitation
could
be
reliably
induced
in
the
prison
setting.
there
is
at
least
one
comment
that
indicates
that
they
doubt
that
we
know
enough
about
human
behavior
to
rehabilitate
individuals
on
a
regular
basis
in
any
case,
but
they
certainly--
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
--well,
certainly
with
regard
to
supervised
release,
we
think,
as
far
as
setting
the
term
of
supervised
release,
the
judge
is
required
to
take
rehabilitation
concerns
into
account,
and
that's
because
supervised
release
is
intended
to
smooth
the
transition
from
prison
to
true
liberty
and
is
specifically
a
rehabilitative
vehicle.
now,
with
regard
to
revocation,
to
the
extent
that
that's
--
that's
at
issue,
we
concur
with
the
solicitor
general
that
3582,
by
its
terms,
simply
doesn't
govern
a
revocation
of
supervised
release
because
it's
not
the
imposition
of
a
term
of
imprisonment
but,
rather,
requiring
the
individual
to
serve
a
portion
of
the
supervised
release
term
in
prison.
so,
by
its
plain
terms,
it
simply
isn't
applicable.
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
the
problem
is
the
judge
has
no
ability
to
ensure
that
the
individual
gets
that
treatment
if
they're
sent
to
prison.
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
she
did
not
get
that
treatment,
in
fact.
and
then,
she's
past
the--
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
--yes,
and
i
don't
think
that
was
that--
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
--well,
judge
--
i
mean,
justice,
i
would
disagree
with
that
characterization
of
judge
moskowitz's
comments,
and
i'd
point
specifically
to
the
joint
appendix,
really,
at
pages
25
through
38,
and
particularly
to
pages
27
through
29,
where
he
very
specifically
says
not
that
he's
imposing
this
time
for
punishment
purposes,
but
really
to
get
her
into
the
drug
program.
he
says:
i'm
going
to
impose
a
51-month
sentence,
46
months
plus
5
months
for
the
bail
jump,
and
one
of
the
factors
that
affects
this
is
the
need
to
provide
treatment.
in
other
words,
so
she
is
in
long
enough
to
get
the
500-hour
drug
program.
and
then,
again,
when
he
actually
imposes
sentence,
he
says
--
the
judge
says:
i
think
a
sentence
--
i'm
sorry.
well,
he
says:
the
court
recommends,
strongly
recommends,
that
she
participate
in
the
500-hour
drug
program.
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
there's
nothing
that
stops
a
sentencing
judge
from
saying
i
think
that
incapacitation,
retribution,
deterrence
justify
a
sentence
of
x,
and
in
addition
you'll
receive
rehabilitative
resources
while
you're
inside;
make
--
you
know,
make
best
use
of
them.
there's
nothing
that
stops
a
judge
from
urging
a
defendant
to,
in
fact,
make
better
of
herself
while
she's
in
prison
or
outside.
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
no.
whenever
the
judge
lengthens
a
sentence
or
imposes
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
that
that
judge
otherwise
would
not
have
imposed,
that
is
a
violation
of
3582.
you
could--
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
--i
think
a
fair
reading
of
judge
moskowitz's
statements
at
the
sentencing
was
that,
in
fact,
he
was
lengthening
the
sentence
for
purposes
of
rehabilitation--
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
--to
make
sure
that
she
got
into
the--
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
--the
government
did
ask
for
63
months.
we
requested
36
months.
there's
--
we
don't
know
with
certainty--
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
--he
did,
indeed.
i
believe
that
--
that
these
particular
issues
are
appropriately
--
i'm
sorry
--
addressed
on
plain
error
review
in
the
circuit
court
first.
i
don't
think
they're
essential
to
the
legal
question
that's
before
this
court.
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
indeed,
he
did,
and
i
believe
that
he
was
taking
into
account
his
own
knowledge
of
the
prison
system
and
what
it
would
require
to
allow
ms.
tapia
to
participate
in
the
500-hour
program.
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
i
believe
that's
for
punishment
and
deterrence,
and
i
don't
believe
that's
an
improper
purpose.
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
well,
i
don't
think
it
is,
because
i
think
we
can
look
at
the
purposes
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
statute
and,
in
particular,
the
system
it
had
in
mind,
the
system
it
intended
to
overturn
when
it
enacted
the
statute.
as
i
mentioned
before,
one
of
the
statements,
a
prominent
statement,
in
the
senate
report
that
comes
up
again
and
again
is
congress
doubted
that
rehabilitation
could
be
reliably
induced
in
the
prison
setting.
the
system
that
was
being
overturned
was
one
of
coercive
rehabilitation
in
which
individuals
were
sent
to
prison
and
prison
sentences
were
tied
to
their
completion
of
these
programs.
and
so
for
that
reason,
i
think
when
you
look
at
a
sentence
that's
employed
specifically
to
get
somebody
into
treatment,
it
is
exactly
within
the
proscription
congress
intended.
if
there
are
no
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
ask
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
thank
you,
your
honor.
let
me
begin
with
a
couple
points
about
the
plain
language
of
this
statute.
when
a
defendant
is
sent
to
prison
so
that
he
can
gain
access
to
rehabilitative
programs,
imprisonment
is
used
as
a
means
to
promote
rehabilitation.
counsel
stresses
only
the
imprisonment
portion
of
that
sentence,
but
it
is
strictly
speaking
within
the
very
prohibition
that
congress
has
articulated.
beyond
that
i
would
point
to
3553(a)(2)(d),
and
counsel
has
left
off
the
last
few
words
in
discussing
that
purpose
of
sentencing
that's
set
out
there.
congress
required
that
these
rehabilitative
resources
be
provided
in
the
most
effective
manner.
as
is
discussed
in
the
brief,
congress
had
determined
with
regard
to
in-prison
rehabilitation
programs
that
they
simply
were
not
the
most
effective
manner.
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
because
congress
has
prescribed
it.
because
congress
made
the
choice
that
it
shouldn't
be
allowed;
and
it
may
seem
unreasonable
to
all
of
us,
but
congress
made
a
determination
that
it
wasn't
appropriate
to
lengthen
these
sentences
or
impose
them
for
purposes
of
rehabilitation.
mr.
reuben
c.
cahn
it's
possible,
but
i
think
that
this
court
entrusts
sentencing
judges
to
follow
its
mandate,
and
if
this
court
says
you're
not
to
increase
sentences
for
the
purposes
of
getting
people
into
rehabilitative
programs,
then
you
should
state
why
you're
putting
people
in
prison,
that
we
can
count
on
those
reasons
to
be
honestly
and
truthfully
given.
