justice
elena
kagan
mr.
roberts,
could
i
take
you
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
at
the
start
about
the
one-way
ratchet?
what's
the
government's
theory
about
what
congress
might
have
been
thinking
when
it
said
you
can't
think
about
rehabilitation
to
sentence
or
to
lengthen
a
sentence,
but
you
can
think
about
rehabilitation
to
make
a
decision
not
to
sentence
or
to
shorten
a
sentence?
what
would
--
what
would
have
been
in
congress's
mind?
justice
elena
kagan
counsel,
assume--
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
bibas,
i
--
i
--
i
have
to
say
i
don't
really
understand
the
whole
premise
of
your
argument.
you're
basically
saying
the
judge
cannot
consider
rehabilitation,
but
the
judge
can
consider
educational
programs,
vocational
programs,
treatment
programs,
and
so
forth.
i
think
most
people
would
think
that
all
of
those
things
are
rehabilitation,
that
there's
nothing
left
over
when
you
say
that
the
judge
can
consider
all
of
those
things.
justice
elena
kagan
yes.
well,
i'll
ask
the
same
question.
justice
elena
kagan
you're
saying
they
can
consider
rehabilitation
in
imposing
a
sentence,
they
cannot
consider
rehabilitation
in
imposing
a
sentence,
but
they
can
consider
all
these
programs
in
imposing
a
sentence.
and
i'm
saying
what's
the
difference
between
all
these
programs
and
rehabilitation?
once
you
say
they
--
they
can
consider
all
these
programs,
what's
left
over
that
they
can't
consider?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
bibas,
just
practically
speaking
what
does
this
clause
instruct
a
court
not
to
do
in
your
view?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
really
who
thought
that?
this
was
1984.
when
people
talked
about
rehabilitation,
they
were
talking
about
drug
programs,
they
were
talking
about
education
programs,
they
were
talking
about
vocation
programs.
they
were
not
talking
about
some
idea
that
had
passed
away
long
since,
that
just
locking
you
in
a
cell
was
going
to
rehabilitate
you.
justice
elena
kagan
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
judge
can
impose
or
lengthen
a
prison
sentence
because
he
believes
that
imprisonment
will
aid
in
a
criminal
offender's
rehabilitation,
for
example,
by
enabling
that
person
to
get
drug
treatment.
petitioner
alejandra
tapia
was
convicted
of
several
federal
crimes.
at
sentencing,
the
judge
chose
a
51-month
prison
term
for
her
sentence.
in
explaining
this
sentence,
the
judge
referred
several
times
to
tapia's
need
for
drug
treatment,
citing
a
prison
rehabilitation
program
called
the
500
hour
drug
program.
the
court
said
some
things
that
suggested
that
tapia
should
serve
a
prison
term
long
enough
to
qualify
for
and
to
complete
that
program.
on
appeal,
tapia
argued
that
the
judge
had
erred
by
lengthening
her
prison
term
to
make
her
eligible
for
the
500
hour
drug
program.
she
argued
that
this
violated
a
provision
in
the
sentencing
reform
act,
which
tells
the
sentencing
court,
and
i'm
quoting
here,
"to
recognize
that
imprisonment
is
not
an
appropriate
means
of
promoting
correction
and
rehabilitation".
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
tapia.
we
took
this
case
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
circuit
courts
and
we
now
reverse.
we
agree
with
tapia's
interpretation.
our
decision
starts
with
the
text.
the
provision
at
issue
here,
section
3582,
instructs
sentencing
courts,
and
i'm
going
to
quote
it
again,
"to
recognize
that
imprisonment
is
not
an
appropriate
means
of
promoting
correction
and
rehabilitation".
that
is
a
straightforward
statement.
it
tells
a
court
that
imprisonment
is
not
a
suitable
sanction
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
a
criminal
offender's
rehabilitation.
and
it
tells
courts
that
they
should
recognize
this
fact
either
when
determining
whether
to
impose
a
term
of
imprisonment
or
when
determining
the
length
of
the
term.
in
other
words,
the
defendant
cannot
be
sentenced
to
prison
to
promote
his
rehabilitation
and
his
sentence
also
cannot
be
lengthened
for
that
reason.
the
statutory
context
supports
this
conclusion.
there
is
another
provision
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
that
says
something
quite
similar
to
a
different
audience.
it
tells
the
federal
sentencing
commission
to
write
sentencing
guidelines
that
reflects
the
inappropriateness
of
imposing
a
sentence
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
for
the
purpose
of
rehabilitating
the
defendant.
that
is
the
same
message
that
section
3582
sends
to
sentencing
courts,
do
not
use
prison
to
promote
the
defendant's
rehabilitation.
and
we
also
note
that
congress
do
not
give
judges
the
power
to
make
sure
the
defendants
actually
gets
treatment
while
behind
bars.
that
is
yet
another
sign
that
congress
did
not
want
judges
to
order
imprisonment
for
that
purpose.
the
united
states
does
not
disagree
with
this
interpretation
of
the
statute.
in
fact,
it
declines
to
defend
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
and
so,
we
appointed
an
amicus
curiae,
a
friend
of
the
court,
to
make
arguments
on
the
other
side.
the
amicus
we
chose
did
an
exceptionally
good
job,
making
a
variety
of
arguments
that
rehabilitation
may
sometimes,
under
some
circumstances,
be
taken
into
account
as
the
basis
for
a
prison
sentence.
we
address
these
arguments
in
the
opinion,
but
here,
it
is
enough
to
say
that
they
are
insufficient
to
overcome
the
clear
statutory
text.
returning
to
the
details
of
this
case,
the
district
judge's
statements
suggest
that
he
may
have
lengthened
tapia's
sentence
to
ensure
that
she
received
drug
treatment.
if
so,
the
sentence
would
conflict
with
the
sentencing
reform
act.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
alito
joins.
