chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-5400,
tapia
v.
united
states.
mr.
cahn.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
putting
aside
the
particular
statement
here,
what
if
a
judge
says:
i
appreciate
that
one
purpose
of
punishment
is
deterrence;
that's
what
--
and
that's
what's
going
to
guide
me,
and
i
think
you
will
not
be
deterred
if
i
only
sentence
you
for
2
years,
but
i
think
if
you
have
to
go
away
for
3
years,
you
will
appreciate
that
what
you've
done
is
wrong
and
you
won't
do
it
again.
is
that
for
rehabilitation,
that
extra
year,
or
is
it
for
punishment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe
--
what
is
the
difference
between
deterrence
and
rehabilitation?
the
person
doesn't
commit
any
crimes
anymore
but
wishes
--
wishes
she
could?
or
--
and,
well,
if
she's
rehabilitated,
she
doesn't
want
to?
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
very
artificial
distinction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cahn.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
what
if
the
judge
sentences
people
who
commit
robbery
with
assault
typically
to
1
year;
he
can
do
it
1
to
2
years,
he
gives
them
1
year;
except
whenever
the
presentencing
report
says
the
person
has
a
drug
problem
and
there's
a
one-and-a-half-year
drug
program
in
the
prison,
he
sentences
those
people
to
one
and
a
half
years?
regularly.
but
each
time
he
says
i
recognize
rehabilitation
is
not
a
permitted
factor;
i
can
send
sentence
this
person
to
one
to
two,
i'm
going
to
pick
one
and
a
half.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
a
problem,
or
does
it
always
just
depend
on
what
the
judge
says?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
wrong
--
wrong
to
do
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
defendant
have
the
right
to
raise
arguments
and
inquire
into
that
in
--
in
every
case?
say
that,
well,
he
did
say
this
was
just
to
--
just
to
punish
me,
but
here
is
a
list
of
10
cases
where
i
think
it's
like
my
case
and
those
people
got
less.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
going
to
be
hard
for
the
government
to
defend
a
sentence
under
those
circumstances.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bibas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.

3
minutes
remaining.

justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank

the
