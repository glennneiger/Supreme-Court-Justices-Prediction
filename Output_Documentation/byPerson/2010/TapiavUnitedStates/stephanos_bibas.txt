mr.
stephanos
bibas
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
sentencing
judges
may
consider
needed
correctional
treatments
in
deciding
both
whether
to
imprison
and
for
how
long.
the
sentencing
reform
act
rejected
the
rehabilitation
model's
unstructured
sentencing
procedures
designed
to
confine
every
inmate
indefinitely
until
a
parole
board
found
he
had
reformed
himself.
it
did
not,
however,
forbid
treatment
programs
targeting
specific
defendants'
pathologies,
such
as
the
drug
treatment
at
issue
here.
the
act
rejected
one
means
of
promoting
rehabilitation
that
was
bound
up
with
indeterminate
sentencing,
not
rehabilitation
itself.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
a
large
concern
for
several
reasons.
the
first
is
this
residential
drug
abuse
program,
rdap,
is
given
to
93
percent
of
eligible
defendants.
the
only
reason
petitioner
did
not
get
it
is
because
she
affirmatively
refused,
said
she
was
not
interested.
the
second
point
i
would
make
is
that
if
we
look
at
the
legislative
history,
the
petitioner
and
the
government's
reply
brief
say,
well,
this
act
stripped
judges
of
the
power
to
do
this.
the
senate
report
makes
clear
this
was
a
simple
administrative
simplification
designed
to
make
it
clear
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
ultimately
controlled
all
of
these
things
but
that
at
the
same
time
it
was
supposed
to
listen
seriously
to
judges'
recommendations.
it
was
not--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--there
were
two
distinct
issues
here.
one
was
putting
her
in
the
particular
prison
that
was
named
was
not
possible
because
she
needed
to
be
separated
from
another
inmate.
the
other
is
whether
she
could
be
put
in
a
facility
that
had
one
of
these
programs.
about
half
of
prisons
--
federal
prisons
do,
and
the
reason
she
didn't
get
that
was
because
she
refused,
she
said
she
wasn't
interested.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
a
couple
of--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--i
just
note,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
the
statute
requires
judges
to
make
predictions
about
deterrence.
that
is
a
forward-looking
matter.
the
fact
that
a
judge
must
predict
the
future
calls
for
appropriate
skepticism
and
a
statement
of
reasons
in
appellate
review.
it
does
not
mean
that
a
judge
may
not
consider
deterrence
because
it's
a
speculative
possibility.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor
is
correct
that
there
is
a
contingency
involved
here,
but
the
contingency
involved
is
no
greater
than
the
contingency
involved
in
other
sentencing
decisions
judges
must
make
and
that
is
a
reason
for
skepticism.
it
doesn't
imply
that
the
act
meant
to
disable
judges
from
doing
this.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
you
phrased
correctly.
our
point
is
not
that
judges
can't
consider
rehabilitation.
it
is
that
judges
may
not
use
imprisonment
as
the
means
of
promoting
rehabilitation.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
is
clear
if
we
look
at
the
statutory
text.
it's
in
petitioner's
brief,
the
blue
brief
at
appendix
2
and
appendix
3.
the
contrast
becomes
clear
if
we
look
at
3553(a)(2)(d).
there
were
four
simple
purposes
of
punishment
the
judge
must
consider.
and
(d)
is
not
everything
that
was
ever
considered
rehabilitation.
it
is
a
specifically
limited
subset
of
rehabilitation.
it
must
be
needed,
must
be
educational
or
vocational
training,
medical
care
or
other
correctional
treatment,
and
it
must
be
in
the
most
effective
manner.
so,
judges
may
no
longer
rest
on
what
judge
frankel
and
the
--
the
senate
decried
as
the
eerie
nonsense
that
everyone
can
be
rehabilitated
simply
by
throwing
them
in
prison
or
simply
by
having
everybody
going
to
social
workers
or
classes,
but
because
criminality
is
not
a
pathology
that
needs
treatment.
but
he
and
the
senate
report
contrasted
that
with
drug
treatment,
which
is
very
different,
because
there's
a
diagnosed
pathology,
there
is
a
criterion
for
success
that's
measurable,
and
there's
a
fixed
limited
time.
and
that
third
point
is
crucial
here,
because
both
petitioner
and
the
government
in
their
argument
said
that
you
can't
keep
someone
in
jail
tied
to
completion
of
programs
or
keep
them
in
until
he
has
been
rehabilitated
through
treatment.
the
indeterminant
aspect
here
was
a
crucial
part
of
what
congress
was
targeting
that's
very
different
from--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
no,
your
honor.
the
main
clause
of
3582(a)
says
shall
consider
the
factors
set
forth
in
3553(a).
it
does
not
say
(a)(2)
--
(a),
(a)(2)(b)
and
(a)(2)(c).
as
the
very
next
section
of
the
sentencing
format
goes,
3583
says
consider
only
these
purposes,
but
3582
says
consider
all
of
these
factors
to
the
extent
they
apply
in
a
particular
case.
now,
the
way
your
honor
reads
the
recognizing
clause
is
as
if
it
said,
except
the
court
shall
not
consider
in
imposing
or
lengthening
a
sentence
(a)(2)(d)
or
if
it
tracked
the
language
of
(a)(2)(d).
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
we've
looked
through
the
entire
united
states
code.
we
have
not
found
a
single
instance
in
which
a
recognizing
clause
is
used
to
mean
an
exception--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--your
honor,
a
recognize
--
we
found
dozens
of
instances
in
the
u.s.
code
where
recognizing
introduces
a
statement
of
principle
or
policy
or
rationale.
petitioner
or
the
government
cite
no
instances
in
which
it's
used
to
impose
a
flat
ban.
what
we
point
out
is
--
justice
kennedy
made
the
point
that
logically
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
imprisonment
and
the
treatment
that
occurs
during
the
imprisonment.
and
if
it's
recognizing
that
the
imprisonment
is
not
an
appropriate
means
of
promoting
correction
rehabilitation,
that
itself
bans
a
penological
policy
that
was
known
in
our
history
and
had
been
known
into
the
1970s.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
judges
in
supervised
release,
it
--
it
--
it's
hard
to
understand
why
in
3583(e)(3)
judges
may
consider
rehabilitation
in
deciding
whether
to
impose
a
term
of
imprisonment
on
resentencing,
and
we've
been
offered
no
logical
explanation
as
to
why
that
same
logic
congress
would
have
meant
a
flat
ban
here
that
it
didn't
spell
out
in
an
initial
sentencing.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
justice
kennedy,
while
i
agree
that
the
reliability
of
the
prediction
is
an
important
factor,
i
think
this
is
dealt
with
through
the
ordinary
appellate
review
that
this
court
has
fleshed
out
in
rita,
gall,
and
kimbrough.
if
there's
93
percent
likelihood,
predictability,
here,
then
the
judge
can
give
it
a
fair
amount
of
weight
as
the
judge
can
give
a
fair
amount
of
weight
to
deterrence
calculations.
if
it's
highly
unpredictable,
then
the
judge
shouldn't
be
putting
very
much
weight
on
that
at
all.
and
i
would
point
out
particularly
that
if
we
look
at
those
appellate
review
cases,
it's
very
relevant
that
the
judge
here
imposed
a
sentence
within
the
range.
as
justice
sotomayor
pointed
out,
there
are
multiple
explanations
going
on
here;
the
judge
arrives
at
a
sentence
within
the
range.
it's
hard
to
tell
here
that
it's
even
a
but-for
cause
versus
just
a
hope.
the
--
the
thicket
of
issues
that
petitioner's
and
the
government's
reading
forces
appellate
courts
into
in
disentangling
sentences
that
are
otherwise
reasonable,
that
are
within
the
range
that
could
have
been
justified
any
number
of
ways,
counsels
against
requiring
us
to
say
one
factor
is
categorically
forbidden
in
the
sentencing
format.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
it
instructs
a
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
simply
locking
someone
in
a
cell
away
from
his
criminal
associates,
away
from
his
pattern
of
life,
is
not
itself
going
to
reform
him.
we've
been
down
that
road.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
a
couple
of
responses
that
i
think
show
that
to
be
incorrect.
the
first
of
these
is
most
of
the
references
in
the
senate
report
are
to
just
generic
open-ended
education,
vocation,
and
counseling.
we
see
maybe
one
reference
to
alcohol
and
drug
treatment
in
there.
the
second
of
these
is
that
idea
of
isolation,
though
it
had
diminished,
was
still
alive
in
the
1970s.
there
was
a
widely
cited
manual
for
judges,
the
1974,
that
said
that
confinement,
quote,
"may
be
necessary
to
break
criminal
associations
and
in
time
to
modify
antisocial
attitudes
and
tendencies.
"
my
third
point
is
this
is
not
just
about
the
substantive
idea
of
rehabilitating.
the
government
and
petitioner
point
out
that
there
was
a
rehabilitation
model,
a
procedural
approach
here
that
was
bound
up
with
that
history
of
the
penitentiary,
and
the
approach
was
that,
in
the
senate
report,
the
rehabilitation
model
ties
prison
release
dates
to
successful
completion
of
programs.
we
don't
have
open-ended,
unpredictable
sentences
any
more.
the
sentencing
reform
act
in
multiple
ways
gets
rid
of
that
unpredictability--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--a
couple
of
points.
one
is,
statistically
i
think
the
number
is
lower
than
you
say.
the
rdap
program
here
requires
12
months
before
admission
having
a
provable
addiction
or
abuse,
so
it's
about
30,
35
percent
of
inmates.
but
granted
that
issue,
that's
why
the
sentencing
reform
act
requires
statements
of
reasons,
subject
to
appellate
review.
if
judges
are
varying
widely,
this
court's
case
law
in
rita,
gall,
and
kimbrough
allows
appellate
courts
to
harmonize
what
they're
doing.
if
this
judge
had
added
5
years
to
her
sentence,
this
would
be
a
different
case.
judge
franklin
and
others
were
concerned
about
sentences
exceeding
5
years,
open-ended,
airy
hopes
that
everyone
will
be
cured
of
criminality.
we're
talking
about
a
sentence
within
the
range,
sentence
that,
if
a
few
lines
of
the
transcript
had
been
whited
out
we
wouldn't
be
here.
a
judge
could
have
reached
the
same
sentence
on
a
lot
of
different
grounds.
and
are
we
going
to
tell
judges
you
can
consider
other
things,
but
if
you
muse
about
this
ground
you
can't
offer
a
thoughtful,
reasoned
justification
--
per
se
automatic
reversal.
there
are
only
a
couple
of
places
in
the
sentencing
reform
act
that
have
categorical
bans
and
they
don't
read
the
way
this
one
does.
the
very
next
section
in
the
act,
3583(c)
says:
"in
considering
a
supervised
release
sentence,
a
judge
shall
consider
the
factors
in
3553(a)(1),
(a)(2)(b),
(a)(2)(c),
and
(a)(2)(d).
"
it
skips
over
retribution
explicitly
where
congress
meant
to
omit
it.
the
other
place
in
the
act
where
congress
explicitly
banned
the
factor
was
in
28
u.s.c.
994(d).
the
commission,
the
sentencing
commission,
not
a
judge,
shall
ensure
that
the
guidelines
are
entirely
neutral
with
respect
to
race,
sex,
creed,
national
original,
and
socioeconomic
status.
when
congress
meant
to
ban
something,
even
within
the
range,
it
spoke
much
more
clearly.
what
it
did
usually
was
it
gave
some
guidance
to
the
sentencing
commission.
and
section
994
has
a
number
of
places
where
the
commission
shall
do
this,
the
commission
shall
ensure
that
this
is
generally
an
appropriate
or
inappropriate.
but
it
left
a
range,
and
it
simultaneously
said
judges
should
individualize
sentences
within
that
range.
991(b)(1)(b)
says
there
are
factors
not
adequately
taken
into
account
in
the
guidelines
that
can
lead
to
aggravating
or
mitigating,
and
judges
can
also
adjust
sentences
to
individualize
them
within
the
range.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
i
understand,
justice
sotomayor.
our
primary
argument
is
that
3582's
recognizing
clause
isn't
about
this
at
all.
this
is
dealt
with
by
3553(a)(3)(d),
what
is
it
that's
needed
correctional
treatment,
and
if
it
fits
within
(a)(2)(d),
ordinary
appellate
review.
if
the
court
is
not
comfortable
with
that
and
thinks
that
there
ought
to
be
more
discouragement,
we
do
have
a
fallback
argument
that
says
that
the
senate
report
talks
about
discouraging
using
this
as
the
sole
basis,
right,
but
that
if
it's
one
of
several
factors,
if
it
appears
to
be
given
a
proper
balanced
weight,
then
there's
no
need
to
be
so
suspicious
of
it.
and
indeed,
when
we
look
at
the
case
law
in
the
circuits
--
and
we've
surveyed
the
most
recent
150
or
so
cases
on
rehabilitation
in
the
courts
--
we
see
very
rarely
--
first
of
all,
we
haven't
found
any
cases
where
judges
are
putting
someone
into
prison
versus
out
based
solely
on
this.
we
find
only
a
couple
of
cases
where
judges
appear
to
be
lengthening
a
sentence
solely
because
of
a
desire
to
put
someone
into
drug
treatment.
usually,
what's
happening
is
something
like
what
happened
here.
the
judge
is
balancing
three
or
four
factors;
it's
in
the
mix;
the
judge
might
well
have
gotten
the
same
result
anyway.
are
we
going
to
forbid
courts
to
have
that
kind
of
reasoned,
open
review,
subject
to
appellate
review,
in
order
to
ban
something
that
isn't
banned
in
the
way
that
994
bans
race
and
sex
or
3583
bans
retribution?
it's
simply
not
the
way
the
statute
words
things
elsewhere
and
it's
not
the
wording
congress
chose
here,
especially
since
this
--
it's
a
subordinate
clause,
it's
hidden,
it's
not
at
all
clear
in
undercutting
the
main
clause
of
3582
in
saying
shall
consider
all
the
factors
of
punishment
here
to
the
extent
they
apply
in
an
individual
case.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
justice
kennedy,
first
of
all,
there
are
programs
out
there
for
which
the
judge's
recommendation
is
a
prerequisite
and
100
percent
of
the
people
who
get
into
the
program
are
ones
whom
the
judge
recommended.
there
are
some
drug
education
programs,
i
believe
a
mental
health
or
sex
offender
program,
where
there's
a
link
between
those
two.
it's
just
this
particular
program
that
we're
talking
about.
the
second
point
is,
as
i
said,
one
of
the
explicit
purposes
of
sentencing
is
deterrence.
a
judge
can
never
guarantee
that
he's
going
to
deter
a
particular
offender
from
committing
a
crime
in
the
future.
the
judge
has
to
make
an
educated
prediction
with
the
help
of
the
probation
or
pretrial
services
officer's
report,
and
that's
subject
to
appellate
review.
but
the
fact
of
the
prediction,
the
fact
of
uncertainty
about
whether
someone
will
be
deterred
or
not
doesn't
disable
the
judge
from
weighing
that
prediction.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
if
you
will
bear
with
me
for
your
colleagues
who
like
legislative
history,
and
i
quote
from
the
senate
report,
that
this
change
is
designed
only
to
simplify
the
administration
of
the
prison
system,
at
page
141
of
the
senate
report.
it
was
not
designed
to
introduce
any
substantive
change
in
the
role
of
judges
or
the
attorney
general.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
no,
the
change
was
made--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--but
it
was
not
intended
to
affect
the
authority
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
or
the
judge
in
their
--
in
their
roles
and
input.
it's
just
that
the--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--it
--
it
was--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
it
was,
actually.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
were
some
legal
issues
that
were
coming
up
in
litigation
over
prison
conditions
and
sentencing
in
the
years
leading
up
to
this
act,
where
there
was
unclarity
as
to
whether
the
attorney
general
or
the
judge
or
the
bureau
of
prisons
--
whose
decision
ultimately
was
being
challenged
in
this
litigation.
and
the
act
made
that
change,
but
it
was
designed
only
to
simplify
the
administration.
it
was
not
meant
to
say
that
judges
therefore
are
cut
out
of
the
process,
and
unfortunately
that's
all
that
we
know
about
that
provision.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
the
committee
in
dealing
with
drug
dependence
said
the
commission
shall
decide
whether
drug
dependence,
etcetera,
is
relevant,
shall
take
it
into
account
only
to
the
extent
that
it
is
relevant;
and
the
commission
decided
as
with
most
of
these
other
factors
that
drug
dependence
shall
not
be
used
ordinarily
in
sentencing
outside
the
range,
but
left
it
to
the
judge
to
decide
within
the
range.
as
to
your
--
so
judges
have
some
flexibility
in
using
drug
dependence
for
within-guideline
sentencing.
and
then
on
your
point
about
a
person
should
not
be
sent
to
prison
only
because
the
prison
has
a--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--no,
i
think
this
goes
to
justice
sotomayor's
question.
that
very
often
these
things
are
bound
up
and
judge
ought
to
be
able
to
consider
it
in
the
mix,
especially
when
it's
not
just
a
program
that
quote,
"might"
be
good
for
him
this
--
this
airy
hope
that
everybody
who
has
criminality
can
be
cured
--
but
specifically
there's
a
specific
targeted
program.
particularly
where,
as
here,
congress
made
a
point
of
approving
of
in-prison
drug
treatment
as
effective
to
reduce
recidivism
where
we
have
a
fixed
term
and
a
specific
diagnosis
that
congress
has
funded
and
encouraged
with
a
12-month
sentence
reduction.
if
this
court
has
no
further
questions,
the
statute
allows
judges
to
consider
needed
correctional
treatment
programs
in
prison
sentencing.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
therefore
be
affirmed.
