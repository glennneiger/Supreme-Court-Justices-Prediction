mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
3582(a)
prohibits
courts
from
imposing
or
lengthening
a
term
of
imprisonment
to
promote
a
defendant's
rehabilitation,
including
by
facilitating
her
access
to
a
prison
drug
treatment
program.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
congress
was
intending
to
reject
the
prevailing
rehabilitation
model
of
sentencing,
and
under
that
model,
defendants
were
kept
in
prison
until
they
were
declared
rehabilitated
based
on
their
participation
in
treatment
programs.
and
what
congress
determined
was
that
--
that
coercing
participation
in
prison
programs
that
way
wasn't
--
had
failed
and
that
rehabilitation
couldn't
be
accomplished
reliably
in
a
prison
setting.
so--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
congress
expressly
determined
to
retain
--
there
were
people
that
said
rehabilitation
never
works;
it
can't
be
a
legitimate
purpose
of
sentencing.
and
congress
decided
not
to
go
that
far.
it
expressly
retained
rehabilitation
as
a
purpose
of
sentencing.
that's
reflected
in
section
3553(a)(2)(d).
but
what
congress
determined
was
that
it
--
that
because
you
couldn't
reliably
induce
it
in
prison,
it
wasn't
appropriate
to
deprive
defendants
of
their
liberty,
expend
the
resources
on
keeping
them
in
prison
for
that
purpose,
but
that
--
that
rehabilitation
remained
a
possibility,
that
other
forms
of
sentencing
were
appropriate
ways
to
attempt
to
achieve
rehabilitation,
and
that's
why
congress
expressly
provided
that,
in
imposing
a
sentence
of
probation,
the
court
can
require
a
defendant
to
participate
in
particular
treatment
programs--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
think
it
would
depend
whether
that
was
an
aggravating
or,
you
know,
mitigating
circumstance
that
the
guidelines
hadn't
adequately
taken
into
account,
but
i
don't
think
that
congress
was
trying
to
prevent
a
court
from
selecting
another
sentencing
option,
such
as
probation,
in
lieu
of
imprisonment
because
the
court
determined
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
sentence
should
be
rehabilitation,
or
to
shorten
the
sentence
to
speed
the
defendant
from
imprisonment
to
supervised
release,
where
the
court
could
guarantee
the
defendant
would
participate
in
programs.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
--
it
was
very
important,
if
there
were
important
purposes
of
protecting
the
public,
deterring
the
defendant
from
committing
other
crimes,
deterring
generally,
then
the
court
was
supposed
to
sentence
the
defendant
to
prison
in
accordance
with
that,
even
if
the
defendant
also
needed
rehabilitation.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
the
prisoner
is
receiving
an
imprisonment
term--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
think
the
prisoner
is
receiving
rehabilitative
services,
yes,
in
prison
--
in
prison,
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--congress
intended
that,
even
if
a
defendant
needed
rehabilitation,
if
the
other
goals
of
sentencing
such
as
deterrence
and
protecting
the
public
justified
a
term
of
imprisonment,
that
the
court
should
impose
a
term
of
imprisonment.
so
congress--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
yes,
but
what
congress
wanted
courts
to
--
required
courts
to
recognize
was
that
imprisonment
is
not
an
appropriate
means
of
promoting
rehabilitation.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
agree
that
you
can
--
there
can
be
rehabilitative
programs
in
prison.
but
what
congress
was
trying
to
preclude
was
imposing
imprisonment
for
the
purpose
of
providing
those
programs
or
lengthening
the
imprisonment
term
for
that
purpose.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
exactly,
your
honor.
the
--
under
the
sra,
judges
have
no
authority
to
place
prisoners
in
--
place
defendants
in
prison
treatment
programs
or
to
require
their
participation
in
those
programs.
and
petitioner,
in
fact,
did
not
participate
in
the
drug
treatment
program
on
which
the
sentencing
court
relied
in
setting
her
prison
term.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
right.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
generally
you
take
the
district
court
at
the
court's
word
for
what
the
purposes
of
the
sentence
are,
and
the
sentence
has
to
be
justified
by
the
reasons
that
the
district
court
gives
in
sentencing
the
defendant.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if
the
--
if
the
judge--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
we
--
i
mean
if
we
--
if
the
question
is
we
know--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--we're
inside
the
district
court's
head,
and
the
district
court
is
actually
not
recognizing
that
rehabilitation
is
an
appropriate
means
of
promoting
--
that
imprisonment
is
an
appropriate
means
of
promoting
rehabilitation
but
is
in
fact
doing
that,
but
not
--
but
being
disingenuous
about
the
court's
reason,
then
the
court
is
violating
the
statute,
but
we're
not
going
to
know
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
that
--
that
it's
going
to
be
hard
for
the
defendant
to
obtain
reversal
of
a
conviction
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i
think,
as
i
said,
that
the
words
that
you
--
that
the
court
is
required
to
give
its
reasons
for
imposing
sentence.
we
presume
that
district
courts
honestly
give
their
reasons
for
imposing
the
sentence
and
that
if
the
court
is
indeed
lengthening
the
term
of
imprisonment
because
the
court
wants
the
defendant
to
be
in
a
program,
that
the
court
will
say
that's
what
they're
doing,
just
as
judge
moskowitz
did
here.
and
once
this
court
makes
clear
that
imprisonment
is
not
an
appropriate
means
of
promoting
rehabilitation,
therefore,
courts
cannot
impose
or
lengthen
a
term
of
imprisonment
to
serve
that
purpose,
sentencing
courts
will
follow
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--map.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
--
what
the
court
has
to
do
is
consider
all
of
the
factors,
including
rehabilitative
purposes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
he's
not
going
to
consider
rehabilitation
at
all
in
imposing
sentence?
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
then,
yes,
that
would
--
that
would
be
a
procedural
error--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--to
fail
to
consider
it
at
all.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
we
don't
think
that
it
precludes
--
the
statute
precludes
considering
rehabilitation
in
the
context
of
imprisonment.
what
it
precludes
is
imposing
or
lengthening
the
term.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
does
require--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
but
the
court
can
also
consider
rehabilitation
to
choose
a
sentence
of
probation
rather
than
a
sentence
of
imprisonment.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
the
court
can
still
require
the
availability
--
require
that
as
a
condition
of
supervised
release
if
the
judge
thinks
that
that's
--
or
as
probation;
if
the
judge
thinks
that
that's
a
really
critical
provision
to
have,
and
the
judge
can
require
the
defendant--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--to
reside
in
the
appropriate
place.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
then
the
judge
would
have
to
decide
whether
moving
from
--
whether
having
the
defendant
in
a
different
location
than
the
defendant
ordinarily
would
be
is
worth
providing
that
program.
i
don't
know
that
--
that
there
are
such
specialized
programs
that
those
things
can't
be
accommodated
as
a
general
matter
in
--
in
most
communities--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
judge
cannot
prescribe
that
he
be
incarcerated
in
a
particular
facility.
the
judge
can
make
a
recommendation
for
a
particular
facility,
but
the
judge
can
require
participation
in
a
particular
program
on
supervised
release
and
residing
in
a
particular
area
on
supervised
release
or
on
probation.
so
a
judge
can,
if
the
judge
thinks
it's
important
enough,
address
that
situation
if
it
would
arise.
i'm
not--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
the
judge
can
say
that
--
that
this
person
needs
to
be
in
prison
for
this
amount
of
time
to
protect
the
public.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
is--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--right.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
a
dual-motive
sentence
--
if
one
reason
that
the
judge
is
selecting
the
term
is
to
impose
a
sentence
of
imprisonment,
that
violates
the
prohibition.
however,
if
the
sentence
would
have
been
the
same
otherwise,
then
that
would
be
harmless
error.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
--
yes.
we--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--we
--
we
think
that
--
that
in
this
case
the
petitioner
won't
be
able
to
show
plain
error,
won't
be
able
to
show
an
effect
on
her
substantial
rights
on
remand.
