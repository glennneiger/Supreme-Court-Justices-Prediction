justice
ruth
bader

now,
what
would
it
be,
mr.
russell,
if
there
were
a
suit
under
rfra
because
a
federal
penal
institution
was
not
allowing
for
the
religious
practices
that
the
act
protects?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
a
suit
under
rfra,
could
there
be
--
would
damages
be
an
appropriate
remedy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
could
we
back
up.
you
are
saying
you
could
get
them
against
the
federal
government
too,
but
the
government
doesn't
think
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
russell,
the
state
looks
at
this
statute
and
says,
oh,
this
statute
preserves
the
plra,
and
under
the
plra
there
are
no
damages
without
having
a
physical
injury.
so
putting
the
plra
together
with
plra
is
telling
us
it's
not
appropriate
relief
when
there
is
no
physical
injury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
the
prison
setting,
then,
isn't
it
an
academic
question,
because
there
are
not
going
to
be
damages
anyway?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
answer
to
justice
alito's
question
is
that
in
the
land
use
area,
zoning
for
example,
those
are
mostly
cases
against
municipalities
or
counties?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
against
the
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those
cases
did
not
involve
states,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
core
question
here
is
the
state
--
and
justice
alito
just
posed
it:
the
state
is
being
treated
with
less
dignity
than
the
federal
government,
because
your
position
is
that
the
federal
government
is
shielded
by
its
sovereign
immunity,
and
you
say
the
state
is
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
waiver
--
i
mean,
on
the
state
side
they
can
say
it
says
"appropriate
relief".
all
right;
we
accept
that
we
are
going
to
be
vulnerable
to
an
injunction
suit.
but
we're
the
state
and
it's
our
treasury,
and
it
is
not
appropriate
relief.
we
didn't
waive
it.
it's
not
--
doesn't
say
in
the
spending
clause
legislation
that
we
open
up
our
treasury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you're
bracketing
the
state
with
counties
and
municipalities.
it
really
comes
down
to
a
question
--
who
decides
whether
the
state
fisc
is
touched.
and
why
isn't
it
most
appropriate
for
this
court
to
say,
congress
can
call
it
either
way,
but
our
rule
is,
congress,
if
you
want
to
reach
the
state
treasury,
you
have
to
say
so
explicitly.
and
then
there
is
no
doubt
when
the
state
enters
a
contract
that
it's
going
to
be
subject
to
money
damages
as
well
as
injunctive
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
a
local
government
would
be
subject
to
damages.
we
are
talking
about
the
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
do
with
the
practical
problem
that's
been
brought
up
that
if
a
state
is
sued,
it
can
release
the
prisoner,
it
can
transfer
the
prisoner,
and
then
no
relief
is
appropriate?
that
the
only
way
that
the
state
is
going
to
take
its
obligation
seriously
is
if
it's
exposed
to
compensatory
damages?
