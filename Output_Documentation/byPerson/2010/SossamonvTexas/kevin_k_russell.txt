mr.
kevin
k.
russell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
accepting
federal
funds
for
its
prisons,
texas
consented
to
suit
for
appropriate
relief
for
violations
of
the
religious
land
use
and
institutionalized
persons
act.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
appropriate
relief
encompasses
damages.
if
you
simply
asked
what
kind
of
relief
is
generally
appropriate
against
a
state,
the
answer
would
be
no
relief,
not
even
an
injunction,
because
states
ordinarily
are
not
subject
even
to
suit
without
their
consent.
and
so
rluipa
necessarily
asks
a
more
precise
question,
and
that
is
what
relief
is
appropriate
against
a
state
that
has
consented
to
be
sued
for
violations
of
this
sort.
damages,
for
example,
are
perfectly
appropriate
against
a
state
that
has
consented
to
be
sued
for
breach
of
contract.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
in--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--in
our
view
they
are,
although
it's
a
different
context,
and
we
recognize
that
the
government
disagrees
with
us
on
that.
we
can't
point
to
the
spending
clause-contract
analogy
that
applies
with
respect
to
spending
clause
legislation
as
rfra
applies
to
the
federal
government.
but
there
are
other
indications,
including
for
example
the
long
tradition
of
damages
being
appropriate
relief
for
the
violation
of
civil
rights.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that
is
our
view,
although
we
recognize
that
rluipa
is
different
in
this
respect,
in
that
it's
a
spending
clause
statute
under
which
--
and
this
court's
decision
in
barnes
v.
gorman
makes
clear
that
damages
are
traditionally
appropriate
relief
for
the
violation
of
any
spending
clause
statute.
of
course,
there
is
also
a
tradition
that
damages
are
for
the
violation
of
civil
rights.
take
statutes
like
title
vi,
title
vii,
title
ix,
section
504
of
the
ada,
the
list
goes
on
and
on,
where
congress
has
created
damages
as
the
quintessential
remedy
to
enforce
civil
rights,
and
when
congress
has
subjected
states
to
suits
under
such
statutes,
it
has
always
put
them
on
equal
footing
with
other
defendants
and
subjected
them
to
damages
as
well.
but
even
beyond
that--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
for
example--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
word
"appropriate
relief"
in
itself
supplies
the
clarity.
it's
looking
at
that
language
and
the
way
the
court
interprets
statutes
generally,
among
other
things,
looking
at
the
tradition
of
what
constitutes
appropriate
relief
for
a
violation
of
this
sort.
we
do
think
that
barnes
v.
gorman
is
appropriate
precedent
in
telling
the
court
--
in
telling
texas
what
kind
of
relief
is
generally
thought
appropriate
to
satisfy
congress's
desire
to
remedy
violations
of
a
spending
clause
statute.
we
recognize,
of
course,
that
barnes
didn't
involve
sovereign
defendants,
but
the
local
governments
in
that
case
had
the
same
rights
as
a
state
would.
it
just
comes
out
of
the
spending
clause
rather
than
the
eleventh
amendment.
that
is,
both
constitutional
provisions
prohibit
congress
from
subjecting
defendants
to
damages
suits
under
spending
clause
legislation
without
their
consent.
and
this
court
has
enforced
that
identical
constitutional
right
with
the
same
clear
statement
test
derived
from
pennhurst
v.
halderman.
even
more,
the
contract
analogy
the
court
relied
on
in
barnes
is
no
less
apt
simply
because
one
of
the
recipients
is
a
state.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that
would
have
been
true
in
barnes
as
well.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
it
gets
the
same
amount
of
help
that
the
local
governments
got
in
barnes,
which
wasn't
enough.
and
not
only
does
the
analogy,
i
think,
apply;
so
does
the
remedy.
damages
are
a
quintessential
appropriate
remedy
for
breach
of
contract
by
a
state
so
long
as
the
state
has
agreed
to
be
sued
for
violation
of
a
contract.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
i
would
say
two
things
about
that.
one,
keep
in
mind
that
the
plra
limitations
only
apply
to
incarcerated
individuals.
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
people
rluipa
protects
in
state-run
nursing
homes
or
mental
health
facilities.
so
congress
wouldn't
have
been
thinking
that
appropriate
relief
is
defined
in
some
sense
by
the
scope
of
the
plra.
in
addition,
we
think
that
the
fact
that
congress
expressly
said
that
the
plra
applies
to
limit
the
relief
that's
otherwise
available
under
rluipa
shows
that
congress
didn't
think
that
the
plra
itself
made
the
relief
inappropriate.
it's
simply
that
there
is
some
relief
that
is
otherwise
appropriate
that
will
be
limited
in
some
circumstances
by
the
plra.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no,
that's
not
true,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
one,
there
are
many
cases
involving
pecuniary
damages.
there
is
destruction
of
religious
items
that
won't
be
subject
to
the
plra
limitation.
there
are
--
there
are
cases
that
give
rise
to
pecuniary
claims.
so
there
is
destruction
of
a
religious
item,
a
bible
or
something
like
that.
there
are
also
cases
in
which
the
violation
will
result
in
a
physical
injury.
there
are
cases
where
people
are
deprived
of
food
for
long
periods
of
time.
there
is
a
case
where
a
prison
refused
to
transport
an
inmate
for
medical
treatment
outside
the
facility
because
he
wouldn't
take
off
his
yarmulke.
congress,
i
don't
think
would
have
thought
that
the
plra
limitations
rendered
a
damages
remedy
unimportant.
and
at
the
very
least--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--excuse
me?
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
the
statute,
i
think,
does
not
in
light
of
barnes,
because
barnes
said
that
you
get
traditional
contract
remedies
and
punitive
damages
are
not
a
traditional
contract
remedy.
beyond
that
tradition,
though,
there's
also
textual
cues
in
the
statue
itself.
there
are
three
of
them
that
i
would
like
to
focus
on.
i'll
list
them
and
then
discuss
them.
one
is
the
definitions
section,
which
lumps
states
in
together
with
local
governments
in
the
definition
of
"government".
the
second
is
the
federal
enforcement
provision,
which
specifically
allows
suits
by
the
united
states,
but
only
for
the
equitable
and
declaratory
relief
that
the
state
says
is
the
only
thing
that's
available
under
appropriate
relief.
and
finally
is
the
fact
that
the
statute
separately
already
authorizes
suits
for
injunctive
relief
against
state
officials,
making
the
addition
of
suits
against
states
effectively
surplusage
unless
some
other
kind
of
relief
is
available
against
the
state.
beginning
with
the
definitions
section,
this
court
recognized
in
the
united
states
v.
nordic
village
that
where
congress,
in
the
bankruptcy
act,
defined
"governmental
unit"
to
include
both
the
united
states
and
a
state,
that
congress
was
making
clear,
quote,
that
"states
and
federal
sovereigns
are
to
be
treated
the
same
for
immunity
purposes.
"
i
think
the
same
lesson
comes
out
of
the
fact
that
rluipa
defines
"governments"
to
include
not
only
states,
but
local
governments,
and
subjects
all
governments
to
the
same
cause
of
action
for
the
same
appropriate
relief.
congress
was
expressing
there
as
clear
as
it
could
that
there
was
a
definitional
equivalence
between
states
and
local
government.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
i
will
point
you
to
other
provisions
of
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
okay.
one
is
the
fact
that,
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
statute
--
and
i
think
the
state
agrees
--
already
allows
suits
for
injunctive
relief
against
state
officials
in
their
official
capacity.
the
only
thing
that
adding
states
as
defendant
would
accomplish
in
light
of
that
would
simply
be
a
change
in
the
caption
of
the
lawsuit,
unless
states
are
subject
to
some
relief
that
state
officials
under
ex
parte
young
are
not.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
i
would
set
aside
the
question
of
whether
ex
parte
young
applies
of
its
own
force.
i
think
by
defining
"officials"
as
a
form
of
government
and
authorizing
suits
for
appropriate
relief
against
officials,
i
think
everybody
agrees
that
that
authorizes
suits
against
the
officials
for
at
least
injunctive
relief.
and
then
the
question
is,
well,
what
does
it
accomplish
to
also
authorize
suits
against
states?
and
i
think
the
obvious
answer
is
it
authorizes
a
damages
claim
against
the
state.
and
even
in
light
of
barnes,
the
state
seems
to
acknowledge
that
damages
are
appropriate
relief
against
local
governments
under
this
statute.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
it's
common
in
that
circumstance
to
sue
the
state
attorney
general
for
ex
parte
young
relief,
for
example,
if
you
have
a
constitutional
claim
against
the
statute,
as
may
very
well
have
happened
in
the
california
case,
or
the
governor,
i
guess.
so
i
don't
think
that
naming
--
having
a
state
as
a
defendant
is
necessary
for
that
purpose
here.
in
addition,
as
i
mentioned
before,
i
think
even
the
state
acknowledges
that
damages
are
appropriate
relief
against
local
governments,
but
congress
made
clear
that
when
it
intended
the
identity
of
a
party
to
result
in
a
dramatically
different
scope
of
relief,
it
did
so
expressly,
and
you
can
see
that
in
the
u.s.
enforcement
provision.
there,
congress
specially
authorized
suits
by
the
united
states
and
had
its
own
remedial
provision
which
provides
only
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
and
that
shows
both
that
congress
didn't
expect
courts
to
simply
figure
out
that
different
kinds
of
defendants
would
be
subject
to
different
appropriate
relief,
but
also--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
the
fact
--
i
would
say
two
things
about
that.
one
is
congress
didn't
limit
that
provision
to
suits
against
states.
it's
anybody
who
gets
sued
by
the
united
states
is
limited
to
equitable
injunctive
relief.
and
that's,
again,
an
example
of
congress
treating
states
the
same
as
everybody
else.
whether
they
are
sued
by
the
united
states
or
sued
by
a
private
party,
it
is
the
same
relief.
it's
the
same
remedial
provision
and
we
think
that
suggests
the
same
relief.
that
provision
also
kind
of
--
the
language
of
that
provision,
"injunctive
or
declaratory
relief",
stands
in
pretty
stark
contrast
to
the
facially
broader
phrase
"appropriate
relief"
in
the
general
provision.
in
addition
to
rluipa
itself,
i
think
it's
also
worth
pointing
out
that
the
state
had
independent
notice
under
section
2000(d)(7)
--
this
is
the
rehabilitation
act
amendments
of
1986,
where
congress
made
clear
to
texas
that
it
would
be
subject
to
suit
for
damages
under
any
statute
that
--
under
a
section
of
any
statute
that
prohibits
discrimination
by
federal
funding
recipients.
and
i
think
the
question
here
boils
down
to
whether
rluipa
is
materially
distinguishable
from
section
504,
which
is
listed
in
section
2000(d)(7)
as
an
example
of
a
statute
prohibiting
discrimination.
and
if
--
i
think
that
means
that
the
catch-all
has
to
at
least
be
broad
enough
to
encompass
section
504,
and
in
our
view,
the
two
statutes
are
not
distinguishable.
both
prohibit
both
the
kind
of
disparate
treatment
of
similarly-situated
individuals
that
the
state
acknowledges
constitutes
discrimination
and
requires
accommodations
in
some
circumstances.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
it's
quite
rare.
i
am
aware
of
one
pending
case
in
vermont
where
there
is
a
challenge
to
a
--
a
state
environmental
regulation,
but
for
the
most
part
it
isn't.
but
if
this
court
were
to,
you
know,
section
--
the
provision
that
we
are
talking
about
here
applies
to
land
use
as
well
as
to
institutionalized
persons,
and
one
would
ordinarily
think
that
the
statute
would
have
the
same
meaning
depending
on
context.
i
recognize
that
the
state's
basic
argument
is
that
the
meaning
changes
depending
on
who
the
defendant
is,
and
i
suppose
if
you
accept
that
it
could
also
depend
on
--
on
what
provision
is
being
applied.
but
that's
not
normally
how
statutes
work.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that
is
correct.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that
is
correct.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no.
i
actually
don't
understand
them
to
be
making
that
argument,
either.
but
i
know
for
sure
that
that's
not
our
position.
and
the
court's
decision
in
barnes
i
think,
for
example,
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
court's
recent
decisions,
including
for
example
in
richlin,
where
it's
made
clear
that
when
you
are
considering
the
scope
of
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
you
engage
in
ordinary
statutory
interpretation
and
then
the
sovereign
is
respected.
if
at
the
end
of
that
interpretation
the
statute
remains
unclear,
you
know,
certainly
the
sovereign
wins.
but--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
don't
know
that
this
court's
cases
support
the
idea
that
--
that
heightened
clear
statement
rule
for
states
versus
the
federal
government.
if
anything,
i
think
they
suggest
the
opposite,
but
so
long
as
the
statute
is
clear.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
thank
you.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
thank
you.
nearly
every
argument
the
state
made
here
today
could
have
been
made
by
the
local
governments
in
barnes.
ranging
from
the
complaint
that
the
language
like
appropriate
relief
is
too
unclear,
to
the
assertion
that
they
were
not
on
notice,
that
by
accepting
federal
funds
they
were
subjecting
themselves
to
suits.
and
that's
because
the
local
government,
like
any
other
state,
had
the
same
right
to
the
same
clear
statement
rule.
unless
this
court
is,
in
fact,
going
to
create
a
proliferation
or
hierarchy
of
clear
statement
rules,
the
pennhurst
rule
that
applies
in
the
spending
clause
context
of
local
governments
applies
in
exactly
the
same
way
to
a
state
government
under
the
eleventh
amendment
and
barnes'
court
construed
the
express
private
right
of
action
under
section
504,
which
incorporated
by
reference
the
remedies
available
under
title
xi,
which
this
court
construed
to
authorize
appropriate
relief.
exactly
the
same
remedy
that
rluipa
authorizes.
and
so
the
state
for
the
first
time
today
has
suggested
that
the
city
of
austin
is
not
bound
by
barnes.
i
don't
see
how
they
can
reach
that
conclusion.
barnes
quite
clearly
says
that
the
local
government
is
subject
to
--
and
is
on
notice
that
it
has
clear,
there
is
a
clear
statement
in
every
spending
clause
statute
that
they
are
subject
to
a
damages
remedy
so
long
as
they
accept
the
funds
because
of
the
contractual
nature
of
the
obligation.
that
applies.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
which
part,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no.
the
question
in
barnes
is
punitive.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
the
legal
principle
this
court
adopted
to
resolve
that
issue
was
one
that,
i
take
it,
was
not
just
a
principle
for
that
case,
but
that
in
general,
funding
recipients
are
on
notice
that
they
are
subject
to
contract
remedies
and
unless
this
court
is
going
to
back
away
from
that
as
a
general
matter,
unless
the
court
is
going
to
say
that
pennhurst
applies
differently
in
the
spending
clause
context
than
it
does
in
the
sovereign
immunity
context,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
come
to
a
different
result
in
this
case.
justice
breyer,
with
respect
to
rfra,
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
only
one
court
of
appeals
case
that
says
the
united
states
is
not
subject
to
suits
and
that
was
decided
six
years
after
rluipa
was
enacted.
with
respect
to
the
idea,
there
are
a
handful
of
lower
courts
decisions
that
say
damages
are
unavailable.
those
--
they
give
reasons
that
are
specific
to
the
idea
and
the
fact
that
that
remedial
provision
is
part
of
the
due
process
hearing
process
there.
in
general,
damages
are
the
quintessential
appropriate
relief
for
violations
of
civil
rights,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
was
creating
in
rluipa
a
second
class
civil
right
that
wasn't
deserving
of
a
remedy
that
congress
has
provided
even
against
states
in
every
other
context.
with
respect
to
the
state's
belief
that
the
eleventh
amendment
somehow
prefers
injunctions
over
damages
remedies,
as
counsel
for
the
united
states
pointed
out,
the
eleventh
amendment
is
no
basis
for
that.
it
treats
injunctions
and
damages
as
equally
offensive
to
state
sovereignty,
and
in
fact,
particularly
in
rluipa,
where
damages
are
often
capped
significantly
by
the
plra,
the
concern
really
ought
to
be
on
the
states
by
injunctive
relief,
which
will
frequently
have
a
much
more
significant
effect
on
the
public
fisc
than
a
small
damages
award.
and
finally
with
the
state's
argument
that
the
words
appropriate
relief
are
too
inherently
ambiguous
to
meet
any
clear
statement.
well,
this
court
rejected
that
kind
of
argument
in
west
where
it
construed
appropriate
remedy
to
encompass
a
damages
remedy
by
engaging
an
ordinary
statutory
interpretation,
which
is
entirely
appropriate
in
this
context.
this
court
has
repeatedly
in
cases
like
ruckelshaus,
for
example,
like
richlin,
relied
on
how
statutes
apply
with
respect
to
private
parties
to
give
meaning
to
the
otherwise
ambiguous
word
"appropriate"
in
the
federal
statute
waiving
the
federal
government's
sovereign
immunity.
thank
you.
