justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
fifth
circuit.
according
to
the
religious
land
use
and
institutionalized
persons
act
of
2000,
prisons
that
received
that
received
federal
funding
may
not
impose
a
substantial
burden
on
prisoner's
religious
exercise
unless
that
burden
is
in
furtherance
of
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
an
issue
in
this
case
is
the
act's
private
cause
of
action
which
allows
a
plaintiff
to
obtain
"an
appropriate
relief
against
a
government."
petitioner
harvey
sossamon
is
a
texas
inmate.
he
sued
state
of
texas
and
various
prisoner
officials
under
this
private
cause
of
action
and
sought
money
damages.
the
district
court
granted
some
rejudgement
for
the
defendants,
holding
that
sovereign
immunity
barred
sossamon's
claims
for
damages
against
the
state
and
its
officials.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
and
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
accepting
federal
funding,
texas
did
not
consent
to
waive
its
sovereign
immunity
to
suits
for
money
damages
under
the
act.
our
precedents
require
that
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
be
unequivocally
expressed
in
the
text
of
the
relevant
statute
and
strictly
construed
in
favor
of
the
sovereign.
the
act's
authorization
of
appropriate
relief
against
a
government
is
not
being
equivocal
expressed
--
unequivocal
expression
of
state
consent
to
monetary
claims
that
our
precedents
require,
nor
does
section
1003
of
the
rehabilitation
act
amendments
of
1986,
independently
put
the
state
on
notice
that
it
could
be
sued
for
the
damages
under
the
act.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
joins.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
