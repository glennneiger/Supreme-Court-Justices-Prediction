justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
say
about
--
i
think
i
read
in
one
of
these
briefs
that
what
i
think
is
the
most
relevant
similar
statute,
rfra,
has
been
held
not
to
encompass
the
same
word
--
not
to
encompass
the
monetary
relief,
and
also
there
was
some
legislative
history
where
people
testified
and
told
congress
at
the
time
that
the
word
"appropriate"
won't
encompass
monetary
relief.
am
i
remembering
that
correctly?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
looking
at
the
cases
the
best
i
can
at
the
moment.
i
think
you
might
say
that
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
which
interpret
the
word
"appropriate
relief"
to
include
monetary
relief.
and
then
there
is
some
that
don't.
and
to
get
a
rule
out
of
them,
you
would
have
to
say,
well,
they
are
looking
to
context.
and
in
context
it
sometimes
is
clear,
sometimes
occasionally
not.
but
here,
isn't
this
and
maybe
this
was
asked,
but
i
want
your
answer.
the
context
here,
the
words
appropriate
relief,
govern
both
the
prison
situation
and
the
land
use
situation,
don't
they?
you
are
given
an
action
when
the
government
through
a
general
land
use
regulation
infringes
somebody's
right
to
build,
for
example.
now,
wouldn't
that
kind
of
interference
with
the
use
of
property
quite
often
and
normally
require
some
kind
of
monetary
compensation?
this
isn't
just
the
odd
thing
in
a
prison,
where
it's
talking
about
it
might
be
called
building
a
religious
building
or
building
some
kind
of
parking,
all
kinds
of
things
that
have
monetary
compensation.
do
you
see
my
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
isn't
it
the
same
word
that
governs
both?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
the
same
word
that
governs
both
and
if
land
cases
very
often
involve
claims
for
money,
i
would
think
that
would
cut
against
you.
but
that's
why
i
ask.
i
want
to
get
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
are
loads
of
cases
that
have
nothing
more
than
appropriate
relief
and
in
those
cases
context
makes
it
clear.
the
only
one
really
i
thought
strongly
--
your
strongest
case
seems
to
me
to
be
rfra.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh-huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
so
often,
what
i'm
thinking
of,
a
church
wands
to
build,
and
they
can't
because
of
a
land
restriction.
and
it
turns
out
that
that
land
restriction
violates
this
statute.
and
in
the
meantime
they
have
had
to
rent
buildings,
they
have
had
to
maybe
build
somewhere
else
and
they
have
had
to
do
all
kinds
of
things
that
cost
money.
and
that's
why
i
would
think
in
that
context
money
would
be
a
natural
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
fulfill
appropriateness.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
ask
--
get
this
information
from
you.
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
some
cases
that
find
the
words
"appropriate
relief"
in
a
statute
to
include
damages
and
there's
some
that
don't.
let's
look
at
the
ones
that
don't.
there
is
some
where
it's
pretty
hard
to
do
it
because
it's
in
a
heading
called
"injunction",
and
that's
obvious.
but
there
are
only
two
statutes,
really,
where
the
courts
have
ever
held
in
significant
numbers
that
the
word
"appropriate
relief"
does
not
include
money
damages.
one
is
the
idea,
the
disabilities
act,
and
the
other
is
rfra.
is
there
anything
else
that
you've
come
across?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
are
there
any
others?
i
mean,
i
just
want
to
get
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
what
i
have
to
look
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you
don't
have
any
others,
i'm
judging
from
your
hesitation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
