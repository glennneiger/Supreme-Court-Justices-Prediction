ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
in
this
case
agrees
that
when
it
accepts
federal
funds
for
its
correctional
system
it
voluntarily
waives
its
sovereign
immunity
to
private
suits
in
federal
court
to
enforce
rluipa,
and
it
is
clear
under
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
such
as
franklin
and
barnes
that
that
voluntary
waiver
encompasses
a
waiver
to
suits
for
money
damages.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
it
would
depend
on
the
context
to
answer
both
questions.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
then
the
answer
would
be
yes
as
to
the
states.
this
court
has
been
clear
in
cases
such
as
franklin
and
barnes
that
in
the
spending
clause
context,
unless
congress
indicates
an
intent
to
rebut
the
presumption
somehow--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--in
the
federal
government
probably
not,
although
this
court
has
looked
to
background
principles
in
interpreting
words
such
as
"appropriate".
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
i
would
say
two
things.
first,
in
both
cases
what
you
want
is
a
clear
statement
of
an
intent
to
waive
the
sovereign's
immunity,
either
by
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government.
and
also
that
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
in
cases
such
as
franklin
and
barnes,
this
court
was
construing
statutes
that
did
not
say
anything
about
what
remedies
were
appropriate,
didn't
mention
remedies
whatsoever.
and
so
we
don't
rely
so
much
on
rluipa's
use
of
the
phrase
"appropriate
relief"
as
we
do
on
the
spending
clause
context.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
those
cases
did
not
involve
states,
that's
true.
but--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--on
the
contrary,
as
to
the
dignity
point,
your
honor,
if
--
the
state
voluntarily
waives
its
immunity
when
it
accepts
federal
funds
that
clearly
condition
the
acceptance
of
the
funds
on
the
waiver
of
its
immunity.
the
state
in
this
case
doesn't
contest
that
it
has
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
voluntarily
to
some
universe
of
suits
to
enforce
rluipa--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
if
you
were
construing
a
state
statute
that
voluntarily
waived
its
own
immunity,
then
you
might
--
we
might
say
the
use
of
appropriate
relief
in
that
statute
should
be
construed
the
same
as
the
use
of
appropriate
relief
in
rfra.
but
in
this
case
you
are
not
talking
about
a
state's
waiver
of
its
immunity
through
its
--
through
statutory
language.
the
court
said
in
college
savings
bank
that
when
a
--
when
a
state
takes
federal
funds
that
are
conditioned
on
a
waiver
of
immunity,
it
is
the
act
of
accepting
the
funds
that
is
the
waiver
and
it
waives
its
immunity
to
suits
to
the
extent
that
it
has
noticed
that
it
is
doing
so.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
that's
right.
but
again,
it's
--
it's
the
act
of
accepting
the
funds
that
are
clearly
conditioned
that
constitutes
the
waiver.
so
that
the
waiver--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--but
there
is
no
basis
in
either
the
eleventh
amendment
or
the
statutory
provisions
in
rluipa
for
distinguishing
relief
of
an
injunctive
nature
from
relief
in
damages
against
the
state.
the
eleventh
amendment
talks
about
suits
in
law
and
in
equity,
and
there
is
nothing
in
rluipa
that
would
give
the
states
notice
that
they
are
waiving
their
immunity
to
suits
for
injunctive
relief,
but
not
give
them
notice
that
they
are
waiving
their
immunity
to
suits
for
money
damages.
this
court--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--but
even--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
two
things
if
i
could,
your
honor.
in
lane
v.
pena,
the
question
before
the
court
was
it
wasn't
--
it
was
outside
the
spending
clause
context,
because
the
question
was
whether
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
applied
to
the
federal
government,
and
when
the
federal
government
applies,
even
in
the
spending
clause
context,
conditions
on
itself
there
is
no
contract-like
relationship.
but
the
second
thing
this
court
said
in
barnes--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--it
has
to
be
unequivocal,
but
--
but
the
context
in
which
you
are
construing
whether
--
whether
the
sovereign
is
expressing
its
intent
to
waive
its
immunity
is
different
when
you
are
talking
about
the
federal
government
applying
obligations
on
itself
than
when
you
are
talking
about
the
federal
government
offering
money
to
a
state
in
--
in
exchange
for
its
agreeing
to
comply
with--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--right.
and
again,
we
are
not
relying
so
much
on
the
use
of
the
phrase
"appropriate
relief"
in
the
statute.
what
that
--
the
work
that
does
is
it
affirms
that
the
background
presumption
of
the
bell
v.
hood
cases
applies
to
proper
defendants
under
rluipa,
which
include
state
governments.
but
as
this
court
said
in
barnes,
when
a
--
when
a
recipient
of
federal
funds
takes
the
funds,
it
is
on
notice
that
it
is
going
to
be
subject
not
only
to
the
remedies
explicitly
provided
in
the
text
of
the
relevant
legislation,
but
also
to
remedies
that
are
traditionally
available
in
suits
for
breach
of
contract,
and
those
include
compensatory
damages
and
injunctive
relief.
now
the
state
would
have
this
court
turn
that
presumption,
in
terms
of
traditional
contract
rules,
on
its
head
by
saying
that
this
--
that
this
court
should
hold
that
the
state
presumptively
waived
its
immunity
to
suits
for
injunctive
relief
but
not
for
damages.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
i
would
give
you
the
same
answer
i
just
gave,
which
is
that
we
are
not
pointing
so
much
to
the
use
of
the
--
using
the
phrase
"appropriate
relief"
in
the
statute
as
we
are
to
the
spending
clause
context.
and
this
court
has
held
that
when
there
is
these
conditions
placed
on
federal
funds,
the
recipient
of
the
funds
understands
when
it
takes
the
money
that
when
it
intentionally
violates
the
conditions
to
which
it
has
agreed
it
will
be
subject
to
suit
for
money
damages.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
this
court
has
consistently
applied
a
clear
notice
requirement
to
conditions
that
congress
places
on
federal
funds.
that
clear
notice
requirement
arose
out
of
cases
like
pennhurst
and
south
dakota
v.
dole,
in
which
there
were
state
recipients
of
federal
funds.
and
the
court
said
that
the
validity
of
congress's
constitutional
action
in
exercising
its
spending
clause
authority
depends
on
it
giving
the
recipients
of
the
funds
clear
notice
of
the
conditions
that
they
are
agreeing
to
because
of
the
contract-like
nature
of
spending
clause
legislation.
now,
that
same
rule
was
applied
in
franklin
and
gebser
and
davis
and
dole,
even
though
the
defendants
in
those
cases
were
not
sovereigns.
it's
still
the
same
notice
requirement
and
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
a
county
government
would
be
able
to
understand,
would
be
on
notice
that
it
would
be
subject
to
compensatory
damages
suits,
and
a
state
government
would
not.
to
be
sure,
the
state
government
has
more
to
give
up.
it
might
be
a
harder
choice
for
the
state
about
whether
to
take
the
money
or
not.
but
the
choice
is
the
state's,
and
when
it
says
yes,
i'm
going
to
take
this
money,
it
agrees
to
the
conditions
that
are
attached
to
the
money.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
thank
you.
