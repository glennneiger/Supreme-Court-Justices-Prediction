justice
antonin
scalia
but
did
it
use
such
language
as
"appropriate
relief"?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
the
question.
our
cases
say
it
has
to
be
clear
to
the
state
when
they
go
into
one
of
these
schemes,
it
has
to
be
clear
what
liability
they
are
subjecting
themselves
to.
and
in
these
other
cases
i
think
it
was
clear.
i
don't
think
it's
clear
with
simply
the
word
"appropriate
relief".
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
--
but,
i
mean,
that
means
either
that
the
federal
government
--
that
the
state
government
is
liable
for
damages
just
as
municipalities
are,
or
that
municipalities
are
immune
to
suit
for
damages
just
as
the
states
are.
i
mean,
that
--
you
don't
know
which
way
that
cuts,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
let's
talk
about
them,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
can
conceive
of
a
case
where
--
where
the
state's
violation
of
rluipa
consists
of
a
state
statute
that
simply
deprives
the
individual
of
his
rights
under
rluipa.
what
state
official
would
you
--
would
you
sue?
it
seems
to
me
you
couldn't
sue
the
state
legislature,
so
it
would
make
sense
to
have
an
injunction
against
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
word
"appropriate"
--
the
word
"appropriate"
would
--
would
suggest
that
to
me.
if
--
if
i'm
a
state
attorney
general,
and
i
--
i
know
that
the
rule
is
sovereign
immunity
and
--
and
especially
with
regard
to
raids
on
the
state
treasury,
i
think
it
would
be
at
least
plausible
that
i
would
--
i
would
read
"appropriate
relief"
not
to
include
monetary
relief.
and
we
have
said
--
the
language
from
our
cases
--
lane
says
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
must
be
unequivocally
expressed
in
the
statutory
text
and
will
be
strictly
construed
in
terms
of
its
scope
in
favor
of
the
sovereign.
that's
--
that's
a
high
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
although
i
might
sit
down
and
come
out
with
a
conclusion
after
intensive
study
that
yes,
maybe
the
best
reading
of
this
statute
is
that
it
allows
money
damages,
i
find
it
hard
to
say
that
it
is
unequivocally
expressed
in
the
statutory
text.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
deny
that
it
has
to
be
unequivocal?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
contested
in
barnes?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
liability
for
compensatory
damages
contested
in
barnes?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
punitive.
and
there
is
a
lot
of
discussion,
the
assumption
that
they
were
liable
for
compensatory,
but
it
really
wasn't
litigated,
was
it?
