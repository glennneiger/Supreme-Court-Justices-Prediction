does

justice

well,
except
this
would
be
a
violation
of
a
statute,
not
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
so
under
ex
parte
young
they
couldn't
necessarily
get
an
injunction.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
language
is
clear
or
not
to
constitute
a
waiver.
there
is
no
principle
of
law
that
you
are
articulating
that
says
it
--
it
has
to
be
--
this
is
not
clear
enough
for
the
federal
government,
but
it
is
clear
enough
for
the
state.
"appropriate
relief"
either
has
a
meaning
or
it
doesn't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
it
is,
why
is
injunctive
relief
included
at
all?
meaning,
what
you
seem
to
be
saying
to
me
is
that
no
relief
should
be
appropriate,
because
no
relief
is
clear
whether
it's
injunctive
relief
or
damages?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
some
would
say
that
injunctive
relief
attaches
more
to
the
public
fisc
then
compensatory
relief.
because
future
conduct
or
change
of
conduct
can
have
an
enormous
intrusion
on
the
public
fisc,
so
why
do
we
draw
the
line
between
saying
one
is
more
intrusive
than
the
other?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
now
we
have
three
distinctions.
with
respect
to
land
use
discrimination,
the
rehab
act
would
presumably
apply.
so
the
rehab
act
says
compensatory
damages
are
permissible
for
that
kind
of
discriminatory
claim,
so
now
we
have
compensatory
damages
for
that.
we
have,
potentially,
compensatory
damages
for
local
governments,
but
not
for
state
or
federal
level.
we
are
chopping
up
the
statute
at
each
stage,
correct?
we
are
treating
different
defendants
differently
and
different
claims
differently
with
respect
to
the
relief
that's
permissible?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
explain
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
equity
permits
money
as
well.
equity
permits
money
as
well.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
inducement
to
do
it
more
quickly
rather
than
to
delay,
to
remedy
the
wrong
faster
rather
than
to
delay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
uh-huh.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
an
ideal
world,
that
they'll
respond,
but
there
is
an
allegation
that
some
prisons
wait
until
the
eve
of
the
trial
after
onerous
discovery
on
the
plaintiff
and
after
enormous
harm
to
plaintiffs,
physical
and
otherwise,
before
they
capitulate.
so
what's
the
inducement?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
to
move
faster.
