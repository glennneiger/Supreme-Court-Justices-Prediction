mr.
james
c.
ho
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
phrase
"appropriate
relief"
is
a
textbook
example
of
ambiguity,
not
unmistakable
clarity.
and
that
should
end
the
inquiry.
mr.
james
c.
ho
we
agree
with
the
u.s.'s
reading
of
rfra.
the
same
should
attach
here.
there
is
an
express
cause
of
action.
so
that
cause
of
action
has
to
do
something
and
we
are
applying
to
that
express
cause
of
action
the
narrowest
reading,
which
is--
mr.
james
c.
ho
--two
answers,
your
honor.
the
traditional
line
drawing
that
you
see
in
sovereign
immunity
is
injunctive
relief.
any
prospective
relief
is
less
intrusive
on
sovereign
immunity
than
any
form
of
retrospective
relief,
damages
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
especially
true
in
this
context,
because
when
you
talk
about
the
spending
clause,
we
can
walk
away
from
injunctive
relief,
from
an
injunction
at
any
time.
we
can
simply
stop
receiving
the
funds
and
stop
accepting
the
funds
and
the
injunction
evaporates,
but
we
can't
walk
away
from
a
damage
remedy.
so
we
are
construing
the
express
cause
of
action
in
rluipa,
like
in
rfra,
to
do
the
judicial
minimum.
which
is
that
judicial
relief
which
requires
states
to
do
what
we
are
already
required
to
do,
which
is
to
comply
with
the
substantial
burden
mandatory
under
rluipa.
so
the
fact
that
appropriate
relief
is
essentially
inherently
ambiguous
should
end
the
analysis,
because
after
all,
the
court
is
required
unmistakably
clear
text
and
rejected
merely
permissible
inferences
for
two
reasons,
to
ensure
both
careful,
robust
deliberation
by
congress
before
disturbing
the
federal
state
balance
of
power,
as
well
as
to
ensure
clear
notice.
mr.
james
c.
ho
i
think
i
do,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
we
certainly
agree
that
your
premise,
which
is
that
context
matters,
the
court
has
said
specifically
appropriate
relief
can
enlarge
or
contract,
it
could
be
mean
monetary
or
it
could
mean
not
monetary,
so
it
does
depend
on
context.
i
confess
that
your
land
use
question
is
interesting,
we
are
obviously
focused
on
section
3.
mr.
james
c.
ho
it
is
the
same
word.
mr.
james
c.
ho
well,
we
are
still
looking
for
express
language
in
the
text.
mr.
james
c.
ho
rfra
certainly
is
the
direct
context
from
which
the
words
appropriate
relief
in
this
statute
are
drawn.
and
rfra,
of
course,
is
land
use,
it's
prisons,
it's
anything,
rfra
applies
to
the
federal
government
or
any
activity
under
the
sun.
mr.
james
c.
ho
so
for
that
reason
alone,
i
think
we
might
resist
the
notion
that
the
specific
uses
of
appropriate
relief
in
rluipa
would
somehow
provide
any
sort
of
change
or
certainly
any
expectation
that
we
would
have
or
that
congress
would
have,
for
that
matter,
that
the
words
appropriate
relief
would
take
on
a
new
meaning
just
because
it's
land
use.
mr.
james
c.
ho
i'm
not
sure
though--
mr.
james
c.
ho
--i'm
actually
not
sure
that
that
would
be
true
even
in
that
context.
certainly
anybody
might
want
money,
but
when
it
comes
to
what
congress
has
indicated
and
what
states
would
expect,
i
would
imagine
that
the
federal
government's
biggest
interest
is
in
making
sure
that
states
and
other
recipients
use
the
money
for
what
it's
supposed
to
be
for,
comply
with
the
substantial
burden
mandate.
and
a
local
government
is
not
doing
so
with
regard
to
a
church,
then
they
should
be
enjoined
so
that
they
would
be
required
to
comply
with
it.
if
anything,
damages
might
exacerbate
the
problem
just
in
the
sense
that
we
are
now
taking
federal
money
and
applying
damages
to
it.
mr.
james
c.
ho
we
are
talking
about
the
state,
your
honor.
to
be
clear,
we
do
not
actually
concede
that
damages
would
even
be
available
against
a
local
government.
our
point
here
is
that
simply
it
doesn't
matter
for
us,
because
we
obviously
are
treated
very
differently
from
local
governments.
i
think
they
have,
both
the
petitioner
and
u.s.
have
indicated
that
the
statute
should
treat
state
and
locals
the
same
way.
the
problem
with
that
is
the
constitution
obviously
treats
states
and
locals
very
differently.
the
constitution
treats
the
state
and
federal
government
in
the
same
way,
in
that
both
enjoy
sovereign
immunity
and
included
in
that
are
the
principles
of
sovereign
immunity,
the
need
for
specific
waiver,
not
just
a
clear
waiver,
but
specific
as
to
the
scope
of
the
waiver,
and
specific
as
to
the
remedies.
mr.
james
c.
ho
that
would
not
be
our
submission,
your
honor.
if
we
are
talking
about
the
2000d(7)
language,
all
that
2000(d)(7)
says
if
you
are
a
provision
prohibiting
discrimination,
then
you
get
the
same
remedies
against
a
state
that
you
would
get
against
any
other
nonsovereign
defendant.
and
if
we
were
representing
the
city
of
austin,
we
actually
would
argue
--
we
think
we
have
good
arguments
--
that
damages
would
not
be
available
even
against
the
city
of
austin.
our
point
here
is
simply
that--
mr.
james
c.
ho
--sure.
i
think
if
i
were
the
city
of
austin,
i
would
make
three
arguments.
one,
the
words
"appropriate
relief"
are
in
the
statute.
i
think
they
--
the
other
one
wants
to
read
this
as
surplusage.
we
would
think
that
the
words
v.
gibson,
noting
that
the
words
"appropriate
relief"
seemed
to
indicate
equitable
discretion,
or
discretion,
and
therefore
equitable
relief.
in
addition,
we
will
note
that
the
words
(4)(a)--
mr.
james
c.
ho
--in
some
limited
formats,
but
it
wouldn't
be
compensatory
damages
in
the
sense
that
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case.
an
additional
indication
would
be
the
fact
that
the
words
"appropriate
relief"
aren't
just
attached
to
the
claim.
it's
attached
to
both
claim
or
defense.
and
of
course
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
you
can
get
money
damages
by
asserting
rluipa
as
a
defense.
so
for
all
those
reasons,
the
city
of
austin
might
actually
have
a
good
case
that
damages
aren't
available
even
against
them.
of
course,
it
doesn't
matter
for
our
case,
because
the
whole
point
is
if
the
city
of
austin
were
to
lose
due
to
barnes
and
franklin,
what
we
know
for
sure
here
is
that
barnes
and
franklin
have
nothing,
nothing
whatsoever,
to
do
with
the
states.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
spend
a
little
bit
of
time
on
that
issue.
mr.
james
c.
ho
yes.
with
the
2000d(7)
backdrop,
but
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
ho
where
states
turn
down
money?
mr.
james
c.
ho
it's
starting
to
happen
in
texas.
mr.
james
c.
ho
i
don't
--
i
can't
think
of
a
situation
where
texas
has
turned
down
rluipa
federal
prison
money.
but
there--
mr.
james
c.
ho
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
state
in
the
country
that
has
turned
down
federal
prison
funds.
of
course,
if
damages
were
somehow
inflicted,
if
congress
changed
the
law,
perhaps
states
would
start
to
recalibrate
that
decision.
their
core
argument
is
that
we
should
just
extend
franklin
and
barnes
to
states.
the
fatal
flaw
with
that
argument
is
that
the
very
principle
on
which
franklin
and
barnes
apply
--
are
premised,
that
principle
does
not
apply
to
sovereigns.
when
congress
passes
a
cause
of
action
and
is
silent
or
ambiguous
with
respect
to
the
remedies,
there
is
a
traditional
presumption
that
we
apply.
non-sovereigns
now
expect
to
be
subject
to
any
possible
remedy
under
the
sun.
precisely
the
opposite
rule
applies
to
sovereigns.
we
know
that
for
sure
as
a
matter
of
precedent
in
lane,
which
rejected
franklin
as
applied
to
a
sovereign.
we
also
know
this
as
a
more
fundamental
basic
principle
of
sovereign
immunity,
because
when
it
comes
to
sovereigns,
we
have
to
have
not
only
a
clear
waiver,
but
also
a
waiver
that
is
specific
to
the
remedy
that
is
being
sought.
these
two
rules
can't
be
reconciled.
you
either
can
apply
the
traditional
presumption
of
all
remedies,
or
you
apply
the
other
rule
that
sovereigns
benefit
from.
petitioner
claims
that
maybe
a
special
rule
should
apply
that
is
unique
to
the
spending
clause,
that
maybe
that's
a
way
to
get
around
the
sovereign
immunity
problem,
but
we
submit
that
fundamentally
misreads
franklin
and
barnes,
because
what's
doing
the
work
in
franklin
and
barnes
isn't
the
spending
clause.
it's
actually
quite
the
opposite.
the
spending
clause
is
cutting
back
against
the
traditional
presumption.
in
franklin
--
i
will
take
each
case
in
turn.
in
franklin,
you
see
pages
and
pages
of
analysis
in
section
2
of
the
opinion,
where
there
is
exhaustive
research
about
bell
v.
hood
and
the
traditional
presumptions
that
the
court
has
applied
for
decades
under
any
thought
of
federal
power.
the
spending
clause
makes
an
appearance
in
franklin
only
at
the
very
end
in
section
4,
invoked
by
the
defense
as
a
potential
reason
not
to
apply
the
traditional
presumption.
the
court,
you
know,
gets
past
that
on
the
grounds
that
the
traditional
presumption
is
so
strong
that
it
does
provide
the
clarity
for
non-sovereigns.
it
doesn't
indisputably
apply
to
non-sovereigns;
why
not
apply
it
under
the
spending
clause
as
well?
the
point,
though,
is
it's
not
the
spending
clause
that
does
the
work.
it
is
--
it
is
the
traditional
presumption.
that
has
even
more
dramatic
force
in
barnes
v.
gorman.
mr.
gorman
would
have
had
a
$1.2
million
punitive
damage
award
that
he
would
have
been
entitled
to,
except
for
the
fact
that
this
was
a
spending
clause
case,
and
that's
precisely
why
he
lost
that
punitive
damage
award.
so
put
simply,
yes,
it
could
be
that
under
barnes
and
franklin,
remedies
would
be
clear
enough
in
that
one
context.
the
problem
is
it's
not
clear
enough
in
this
context,
because
sovereigns
present
a
completely
different
constitutional
context.
i
want
to
address
very
quickly
justice
sotomayor's
question
about
ex
parte
young.
i
think
you
were
exactly
right
that
ex
parte
--
that
our
reading
isn't
in
any
way
redundant
with
ex
parte
young,
but
i
want
to
note
an
additional
reason
why
we
are
not
redundant.
we
need
to
confirm,
congress
needed
to
confirm,
that
there
was
in
fact
a
privately
enforceable
right,
and
that's
why
our
reading
in
no
way
renders
the
ex
parte
young
concept
redundant.
mr.
james
c.
ho
if
a
prisoner
is
transferred,
released,
or
the
state
simply
changes
its
mind
and
gives
up
and
provides
the
accommodation,
in
all
those
situations,
the
prisoner
is
no
longer
suffering
from
the
complaint
of
condition.
that's
why
this
court's
mootness
doctrines
would
apply.
put
another
way,
mootness
is
really
just
another
word
for
settlement,
and
we
would
think
that
settlement,
the
state
essentially
capitulating
and
saying:
our
bad,
we
should
have
complied,
we
should
have
provided
the
accommodation,
that
actually
vindicates
the
purpose
of
rluipa,
and
indeed,
it
avoids
the
need
for
costly
litigation
to
do
so.
i
want
to
mention
briefly
the
u.s.--
mr.
james
c.
ho
--the
reason
to
do
it?
mr.
james
c.
ho
simply
to
avoid
litigation.
i
mean,
the
way
this
works
practically
on
the
ground,
prisons
obviously
have
a
lot
to
deal
with,
a
lot
of
security
concerns.
they
set
general
policies.
they
may
not
be
aware
that
their
policy
might
have
an
implication
for
a
certain
individual
of
a
particular
faith.
if
that's
brought
to
their
attention
and--
mr.
james
c.
ho
--well,
the
inducement
is
to--
mr.
james
c.
ho
--states
are
--
states
are
suffering
the
litigation
costs
as
well.
we
are
not
in
the
business
to
litigate
just
because
we
want
to.
we
have
plenty
of
other
suits
to
deal
with.
this
very
case,
i
think,
is
a
good
example.
once
the
prisoner
--
once
mr.
sossamon
agreed
with
respect
to
the
salt
restriction
policy,
we
immediately
abandoned
that
policy,
before
litigation
was
even
filed.
with
respect
to
the
u.s.
cause
of
action
provision,
there
was
an
argument
that
appropriate
relief
has
to
mean
damages,
because
otherwise
just
take
that
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief
language
and
put
it
into
the
private
cause
of
action.
the
reason
that
argument
doesn't
work
is
because
these
are
two
fundamentally
different
provisions.
there
is
(4)(f)
of
rfra,
which
is
the
u.s.
cause
of
action,
and
there
was
(4)(a)
of
--
i'm
sorry,
of
rluipa
--
and
there
is
(4)(a)
of
rluipa,
which
is
not
just
a
private
cause
of
action,
but
also
a
defense.
so
again,
if
you
can
imagine
sticking
in
the
words
(4)(a),
it
doesn't
work.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
because
what
person
asserting
a
defense
would
seek
an
injunctive
relief?
if
you
take
what's--
mr.
james
c.
ho
--those
are
two
great
examples.
mr.
james
c.
ho
sure.
i
think
there
are
two
--
two
great
examples.
i
would
note--
mr.
james
c.
ho
--no,
no
--
i
would
actually
--
i
would
note
there
are
two
other
cases--
mr.
james
c.
ho
--that
i
would
refer
you
to,
and
of
course
discussed
in
the
briefs.
west
v.
gibson
which
talks
about
how
the
words
appropriate
relief,
remedies
in
that
context,
by
definition
have
no
fixed
meaning;
they
can't
possibly
have
fixed
meaning.
so
it
has
to
enlarge
or
contract.
and
prior
to
1991
--
prior
to
1991
amendment
at
issue
in
that
case
--
the
court
would
unanimously
agreed
that
appropriate
relief
would
not
have
included
money
damages.
ruckelshaus
provides
similar
guidance,
in
that
i
think
the
phrase
was,
there
was
no
possible
--
no
comprehensible
or
principled
meaning
to
the
phrase
"appropriate"
as
attached
to
a
remedy.
i
will
briefly
touch
on
the
2000d-7
issue
unless
there
are
questions
about
that.
assuming
the
issue
is
even
preserved
for
this
court's
consideration,
2000d-7
doesn't
allow
relief,
either.
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why
that
would
be
so,
but
i
think
the
simplest
is
simply
to
acknowledge
the
difference
between
section
2
of
rluipa
and
section
3.
section
2
of
rluipa
is
much
like
the
four
provisions
expressly
enumerated
in
2000d-7,
in
that
all
of
them
have
the
word
discrimination
and
more
importantly
turn
on
the
concept
of
discrimination.
a
discrimination
is
an
element
of
a
cause
of
action
under
section
2,
or
under
any
of
the
four
provisions
enumerated.
by
contrast
section
3
is
not.
you
can
have
discrimination
as
--
as
part
of
your
fact
background
if
you
want
but
it
will
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
whether
have
you
a
valid
section
3
claim
or
not.
mr.
james
c.
ho
i'll
try
to
take
each
of
those
points
in
turn.
we
don't
see
anything
in
the
law
that
suggests
that
sometimes
there
is
a
clear
statement
rule
and
sometimes
there
is
a
super-duper
clear
statement
rule.
i
think
there
has
been
some
suggestion
--
or
maybe
there
has
not
been
any
more;
i'm
not
sure;
i
read
the
briefs
the
same
way,
i
think
the
same
way
that
the
justices
did.
but
they
seem
not
to
be
arguing
that
any
more.
so
it
should
be
the
same
standard.
i
--
i
certainly
acknowledge
that
when
it
comes
to
the
spending
clause
as
you
wrote
in
your
dissent
in
davis
v.
monroe,
that
the
spending
clause
if
anything
does
raise
special
constitutional
considerations
as
a
general
matter,
inasmuch
as
the
spending
clause
could
be
used
to
impose
federal
restrictions
on
states
that
they
could
never
dream
of
under
article
i
otherwise.
rluipa
of
course
is
a
prime
example
of
that.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
spending
clause
is
not
doing
any
work
with
regard
to
providing
an
assumption
or
presumption
of
remedies.
again,
it's
exactly
precisely
the
opposite.
franklin
and
barnes
both
articulate
that
it's
the
traditional
presumption
that
applies
to
any
exercise
of
federal
power.
that
traditional
presumption
is
what's
doing
the
work.
the
spending
clause
if
anything
is
a
cut
back.
so
the
notion
that
just
invoking
the
spending
clause
suddenly
puts
states
on
this
fabulously
clear
notice,
i
think
just
does
not
work.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor?
mr.
james
c.
ho
thank
you.
