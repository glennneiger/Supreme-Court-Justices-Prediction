justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
argued
that
a
possible
purpose
of
that
was
to
make
it
clear
that
the
federal
government
couldn't
sue
a
state
to
recover
money
that
had
been
given
to
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
addressed
the
--
the
effect
of
the
issue
here
on
persons
who
are
in
state
institutions
other
than
penal
institutions.
what
would
be
--
what's
the
effect
of
the
issue
here
on
land
use
restrictions?
are
there
many
cases
in
which
issues
involving
land
use
restrictions
are
--
are
raised
in
litigation
against
the
state
as
opposed
to
a
municipality?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
congress
passes
a
statute
that
creates
a
private
right
of
action
against
both
the
federal
government
and
against
the
states
and
in
both
instances
authorizes
all
appropriate
relief.
are
damages
available
in
the
action
against
the
federal
government
as
well
as
the
state
government?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
state
--
the
state
provision
is
a
spending
clause
provision.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
about
the
federal
government?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
sense
does
that
make?
other
than
--
i
know
you
are
representing
a
client
and
so
special
pleading
for
your
client
is
--
is
to
be
expected,
but
i
find
that
very
difficult
to
accept.
if
"all
appropriate
relief"
includes
damages
as
against
the
state
that
accepts
federal
money,
then
you
know,
what's
good
for
the
state
should
be
good
for
the
federal
government.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
before
you
do
that,
barnes
and
franklin
were
cases
involving
implied
rights
of
action;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
