the
government
is
going
to
tell
us
that
the
standard
for
waiver
with
respect
to
the
federal
government
is
different
from
the
standard
with
respect
to
the
state.
do
you
--
i
think
that's
what
they
are
going
to
tell
us.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
states
are
in
need
of
special
protection.
with
--
with
the
congress,
if
it's
a
federal
immunity,
the
congress
can
always
--
always
change
its
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
just
can't
happen
with
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
the
suggestion
of
the
opposite
that
--
that
i
am
trying
--
i
am
trying
to
explore.
you
have
your
white
light
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
are
talking
about
general
principles
of
interpretation
and
the
proposition
that
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
state
surely
should
be
entitled
to
the
same
dignity,
the
same
protection
against
suits
as
the
federal
government,
and
you
suggest
just
the
opposite.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
contrary
to
standard
principles
of
the
federal
--
of
protecting
the
federal
balance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
--
but
it's
only
because
they
accept
the
funds
at
all
that
the
spending
--
that
the
spending
clause
is
even
operative.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
--
this
one
question
may
be
covered,
but
can
you
give
me
any
examples
where
states
have
turned
down
money
under
the
spending
clause,
say
we
don't
want
it,
the
restrictions
are
too
great?
does
this
happen
all
the
time,
or
ever?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
states
tell
the
federal
government:
no,
thank
you,
we
don't
want
the
money.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
programs
like
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean
other
states
--
they
say,
oh,
the
liabilities
are
just
too
great,
we
don't
want
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
--
you
have
already
addressed
this
but
i
think
it's
their
--
the
position
of
your
friend
on
the
other
side
of
the
case
is
that
with
the
spending
clause
you
have
a
contract.
the
state
has
some
extra
protection,
and
therefore
we
need
not
be
quite
so
strict
in
--
in
construing
waivers
--
waivers
of
immunity,
because
you
have
the
contract.
can
you
comment
on
that
argument?
and
--
and
you
might
want
to
say
that
the
spending
clause
is
potentially
so
sweeping
that
the
state
should
have
special
protection
and
we
should
be
particularly
careful
about
the
clear
statement
rule.
or
do
you
think
the
clear
statement
rule
applies
with
equal
force
whether
it's
a
spending
clause
or
a
direct
regulation
under
say,
the
fourteenth
amendment?
