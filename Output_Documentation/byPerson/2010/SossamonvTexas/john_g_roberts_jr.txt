chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
in
08-1438,
sossamon
v.
texas.
you
don't
look
like
mr.
schnapper.
mr.
russell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
contract
analogy,
i
suppose,
would
provide
that
the
meaning
of
the
contract
is
interpreted
against
the
drafter.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
so
to
the
extent
the
state
is
arguing
for
a
restrictive
interpretation,
it
gets
at
least
a
little
help
from
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
wrote
the
statute.

justice

g.
