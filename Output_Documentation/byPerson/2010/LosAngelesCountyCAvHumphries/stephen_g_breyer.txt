justice

what
is
the
answer
to
justice
alito's
question?
the
--
a
clerk
doesn't
give
a
license
to
someone
he
should.
right?
now,
you
bring
--
that
person
brings
a
lawsuit
against
the
city.
now,
if
monell
applies,
in
order
to
win
he
has
to
show
that
it
was
the
city's
policy
to
deny
it,
or
maybe
all
he
has
to
show
is
the
city's
policy
was
to
leave
it
up
to
the
clerk.
and
if
he
finds
it's
the
city's
policy
to
grant
it,
he's
going
to
lose,
which
he
should,
because
there
was
no
such
policy.
the
clerk
was
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
harm
in
that?
now,
the
next
question
would
be:
if
we
show
the
third,
is
there
any
ground
for
injunction
against
the
city?
and
on
that
one,
i
don't
know.
maybe
there
is.
maybe
conditions
have
changed.
i
don't
know.
but
what's
the
harm
to
anybody
in
doing
--
requiring
that
in
order
--
just
what
i
said?
what's
the
harm?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
two
possibilities
--
three
possibilities.
the
clerk
denied
the
license.
a,
there
is
a
city
policy
which
requires
him
to
do
it;
b,
there
is
a
city
policy
that
permits
him
to
do
it;
c,
there
is
a
city
policy
that
forbids
him
to
do
it.
all
right.
now,
those
are
the
only
three
i
can
think
of.
and
it
seems
to
me
in
a
or
b,
you
could
recover
against
the
city,
and
in
c
you
couldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so
--
so,
why--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
there
is
no
city
policy,
then
the
city
hasn't
done
anything
wrong
under
monell.
now,
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
that
the
city
should,
even
though
it
has
no
policy,
nonetheless
have
to
have
attorney's
fees,
is
open
to
suit,
et
cetera,
and
forget
about
monell?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
are
right
about
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
if
you
are
right
about
that,
there
is
no
problem
for
you,
because
you
are
saying:
yes,
you
need
a
city
policy,
and
this
counts
as
a
policy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
ninth
circuit
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--against
state.
i
mean,
here
you
have
a
statute
and
the
statute
doesn't
have
any
method
to
get
out
off
--
get
out
of
it,
even
when
you
should.
their
claim
is
this
is
a
state
matter,
the
state's
responsible,
it's
unconstitutional,
go
sue
the
state
and
tell
the
state
to
do
it.
now
that's
a
--
what's
wrong
with
that
position?
and
either
they
had
the
power
to
do
it
under
state
law
or
they
didn't.
if
they
did
have
a
power
to
do
it
then
you
probably
will
show
a
practice.
if
they
didn't
have
the
power
to
do
it,
why
should
they
do
anything
against
them.
you
should
tell
the
state,
go
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
did
the
state
--
why
did
they
send
it
back?
i
thought
they
sent
it
back
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
was
some
policy
against
doing
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
basic
civil
rights
statute
42
u.s.c.
section
1983
says
“every
person
who,
under
color
of
any
state
statute,
ordinance,
regulation,
custom
or
usage,
subjects
or
causes
to
be
subjected
any
other
person
to
the
deprivation
of
any
right
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
to
the
party
injured
in
an
action
at
law,
suit
in
equity
or
other
proper
proceeding
for
redress.”
it's
a
basic
text.
in
1961,
this
court,
in
the
case
called
“monroe
versus
pape”
held
that
that
statute,
the
text
i
read,
did
not
apply
to
the
actions
of
cities
or
towns
or
other
municipalities.
but
16
years
later,
in
another
case
called
“monell”,
the
new
york
city
department
of
social
services,
the
court
reconsidered
the
question
of
municipal
liability
under
section
--
sections
1983
and
it
overruled
monroe.
in
doing
so,
it
held
municipalities
are
persons
who
can
be
held
liable
under
section
1983.
but
they
can
be
held
liable
only
for
their
own
actions.
they
cannot
be
held
by
vicariously
liable
for
the
actions
of
others,
say
their
employees.
now,
i'll
repeat
that,
that's
the
key
point.
the
court
expressly
said,
a
“municipality
cannot
be
held
liable”
solely
for
the
acts
of
others,
solely
because
it
employs
a
tortfeasor.
but
a
municipality
can
be
held
liable
for
its
own
actions,
namely,
when
execution
of
a
government
policy
or
custom
inflicts
the
injury.
that's
the
basic
rule.
the
ninth
circuit
and
has
held
that
this
municipality
liability
requirement,
the
policy
or
custom
requirement,
does
apply
when
a
plaintiff
sues
a
municipality
for
damages
but
they've
also
held
that
the
policy
or
custom
requirement
does
not
apply
when
a
plaintiff
seeks
injunctive
or
other
perspective
relief
looking
to
the
future.
so,
that's
the
cast
question
before
us.
we
look
at
this
last
holding,
are
they
right
to
make
this
exception
for
perspective
relief?
in
our
view,
the
ninth
circuit's
exception
to
the
ordinary
policy
or
custom
requirement
is
wrong.
it
has
no
basis
in
law.
monell,
referring
to
earlier
cases,
said
specifically
that
its
interpretation
of
the
statute
should
not
“have
a
bifurcated
application
to
municipal
corporations
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
relief
sought”.
monell's
logic
and
reasoning
lead
to
exactly
the
same
conclusion.
there
is
no
difference,
whether
it's
perspective
relief
or
whether
it's
a
monetary
relief
that
they
seek.
all
the
other
circuits
who've
decided
the
question
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
and
for
these
reasons,
which
we
explain
more
fully
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
monell's
policy
or
custom
requirement
applies
in
section
1983
cases,
whether
the
relief
sought
is
monetary
or
whether
it
is
perspective.
and
we
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
contrary
determination.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
