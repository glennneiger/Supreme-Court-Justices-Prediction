mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin,
perhaps,
by
trying
to
answer
justice
alito's
question
about
what
is
at
stake
here.
monell
held
that
1983
as
a
causation
requirement.
and
the
court
has,
in
a
series
of
decisions,
elucidated
what
a
plaintiff
must
prove
in
the
context
of
claims
for
damages
to
satisfy
that
causation
requirement,
and
it's
held
in
particular
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
city
employee
committed
a
violation
under
color
of
state
law
in
the
past
is
not
itself
a
sufficient
link
to
the
municipality
itself.
and
the
decisions
have
been
devoted
to
elucidating
precisely
what
else
is
required
in
order
to
show
the
sufficient
link
to
the
municipality.
the
question
here
arises
in
what,
we
submit,
is
the
very
different
factual
context
of
ongoing
constitutional
violations.
and
we
think
that
although
the
jurisprudence
that's
developed
under
monell
has
been
devoted
to
fleshing
out
this
other
context,
the
court
should
take
a
look
at
whether
that
jurisprudence
is
the
appropriate
way
to
determine
whether
the
causation
test
is
satisfied
when
there
is
an
ongoing
violation,
because
there
is
an
easier
way
to
do
it.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
we
believe
it
does
require
causation,
but
the
question
is
what
kind
of
facts
have
to
be
shown
to
prove
causation.
and,
in
particular,
once
a
plaintiff
has
shown
what
is
required
otherwise
to
show
the
violation,
to
show
standing
prospective
relief
and
obtain
prospective
relief,
we
think
those
elements
will
necessarily
encompass
the
showing
that
is
required
to
prove
a
link
to
the
municipality
itself.
and
what
our
concern--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--your
honor,
we
think
that
it
should
be
easy.
it
should
be
present
in
every
case.
our
concern
is
that
courts
might
be
confused
by
the
idea
that
what
they
are
supposed
to
do
is
apply
the
jurisprudence
that's
really
been
developed
to
target
who
was
responsible
for
this
act
that
happened
in
the
past,
and
not
realize
that
there
is
really
a
quite
more
expeditious
way
to
determine
in
the
future.
here,
it's
quite
clear
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
is
an
ongoing
failure
by
the
county
to
provide
due
process.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
guess
i
need
to
clarify.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
because
i
think
what
the
city
has
said,
your
honor,
is
what
monell
requires
is
for
the
plaintiff
to
show
something
in
addition
to
what
the
plaintiff
has
to
--
to
what
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
to,
a,
prove
a
constitutional
violation,
and
b,
prove
an
entitlement
to
prospective
relief.
the
plaintiff
says
there
is
an
additional
element
that
may
or
may
not
be
present,
and
our
submission
is
that
the
ninth
circuit,
although
its
rationale
might
have
been
slightly
off,
was
correct
in
saying
once
a
plaintiff
has
shown
an
ongoing
constitutional
violation
and
that
the
plaintiff
is
entitled,
under
standing
principles
and
principles
governing
prospective
relief,
to
relief,
the
plaintiff
has
necessarily
shown
a
link
to
the
municipality.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
we
agree
that
causation
is
required.
i
think
the
only
slight
fill-up
that
i
would
make
to
your
comment
is,
i
think,
in
some
of
the
jurisprudence
that's
developed
focused
on
finding
responsibility
for
past
conduct.
some
of
the
ways
courts
have
developed
to
decide
those
questions--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--sure.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i'm
sorry,
your
honor
--
where
the
monell
couldn't
be
satisfied?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
this
case,
to
the
extent
that
what
the
city
is
saying
is
that
monell
was
not
satisfied
here,
is
a
perfect
example,
because
here--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
just
to
respond
to
the
chief
justice's
statement--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
petitioner's
position
is
that
this
standard
would
apply
also
in
ex
parte
young
actions
against
state
officials.
the
court--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it's
not
before
you.
the
court's
jurisprudence
is
a
little
uncertain
as
to
whether
that
might
or
might
not
be
true.
there
certainly
hasn't
been
a
holding
to
that
effect.
but
one
of
the
reasons
we
think
this
is
an
important
issue
to
be
very
clear
about
is
because,
at
least
on
petitioner's
view,
and
possibly
on
the
view
of
how
--
depending
on
how
the
court
analyzes
the
case,
this
would
affect
not
just
the
universal
cases
on
municipalities,
but
also
whether
relief
is
available
for
ongoing
constitutional
violations
in
the
very
broad
group
of--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
but
it
might
not,
your
honor,
because
it
might
turn
just
on
whether
--
i
mean,
ex
parte
young
suits
against
state
officials
are
under
1983.
and
so
to
some,
i
think
the
argument
that
petitioner
would
make
is
if
causation
is
required
under
1983,
well,
ex
parte
young
is
just
a
vehicle
to
get
those
people
--
to
make
those
people
person.
so
whatever
the
court
were
to
decide
about
causation
wouldn't
necessarily
apply
in
those
ex
parte
young
issues.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think,
your
honor,
we
gave
some
examples
in
our
--
in
our
brief.
and
one
i
would
give
is
the
example
of
the
marriage
license
clerk
who
is
engaging
in
unconstitutional
--
who
is
violating
the
constitution
and
denying
marriage
licenses.
he
or
she
is
not--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it
may
be,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
has
required
that
there
be
some
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
i
guess
the
way
i
would
look
at
the
case
is,
if
the
party
who
is
being
injured
filed
suit
against
the
municipality
and
against
the
official
and
said,
i
would
like
a
marriage
license,
that,
as
the
court
heard
the
case
and
found
yes,
there
is
an
unconstitutional
denial
going
on
there,
the
fact
that
the
lawsuit
existed
and
there
was
an
ongoing
violation
that
had
been
by
virtue
of
the
lawsuit
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
policymaker,
and
if
in
that
case
the
judge
decided
that
prospective
relief
is
necessary,
which
necessarily
means
that
there
was
some
finding
of
ongoing
violation
under
lyons
and
those
cases,
that
there
would
be
a
link
to
the
municipality.
and
my
concern
is
not
that
properly
applied
causation
requirement
would
weed
out
cases.
it's
that
because
the
focus
of
the
court's
jurisprudence
up
till
now
has
not
been
on
the
ongoing
violation
as
the
possible
source
of
a
policy,
but
rather
was
there
a
policymaker
involved
in
the
initial
denial,
unless
if
the
court
were
to
say
there's
an
extra
step,
it
would
make
very
clear
that
the
focus
of
attention
is
not
the
initial
action,
in
terms
of
finding
a
policy,
but
on
the
day
--
as
the
matter
ends
up
on
the
day
the
district
court
is
deciding
whether
or
not
to
grant
relief,
that
those
facts
are
relevant
in
deciding
whether
there
is
a
policy,
as
well.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
it's
the
--
i
think
in
your
hypothetical
--
i
may
have
misunderstood
it,
but
this
was
a
sort
of
a
one-off
decision
by
the
--
by
the
clerk.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
guess
my--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
was
just
going
to
add
that
--
i
was
just
going
to
add
that
example,
where
the
city
just
is
agnostic.
the
clerk
is
going
on--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--my
argument
is
this,
your
honor.
if
there
is
one
clerk
who
issues
marriage
licenses
and
that
clerk
continues
to
deny
the
marriage
license
up
until
the
day
of
the
lawsuit,
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
is
entitled
to
relief,
to
injunctive
relief,
because
the
city,
by
virtue
of
tolerating
the
conduct,
has
adopted
a
de
facto
policy
of
permitting
it.
and
the
alternative
is--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--that
there
is
no
relief.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
and
our
concern
is
that
the
court's
jurisprudence,
because
it
has
been
focused
on
retrospective
one-off,
for
the
most
part,
actions,
doesn't
make
clear
what
the
answer
is
in
that
situation.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
first
of
all,
the
ninth
circuit
didn't.
and
i
--
i
go
back
to--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--did
not.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
i
go
back
to
our
position,
which
is:
if
causation
is
required,
which
it
is,
the
question
on
which
i
think
guidance
for
the
lower
courts
would
be
very
helpful
is
not
to
simply
say
monell
is
--
monell
applies;
adopt
our
jurisprudence
that
was
focused
on
retrospective
conduct
or
prospective
conduct,
but
rather,
yes,
monell's
causation
requirement
applies,
but
we
recognize
in
this
context
it
is
likely
to
be
satisfied
by
the
other
things
that
the
plaintiff
is
required
to
prove.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and,
your
honor,
my
response
to
that
is
that
monell
was
not
wrong.
i
don't
know
that
monell
squarely
addressed
the
question,
but
clearly
the
statute
has
a
causation
element
and
it
has
to
be
met.
but
what
monell
didn't
grapple
with,
because
it
itself
was
a
case
involving
only
a
past
non-continuing
event,
is:
how
does
that
causation
requirement
get
met
in
a
case
involving
an
ongoing
violation?
and
we
think
that
although
the
ninth
circuit
may
not
have
had
its
reasoning
quite
right,
what
--
the
--
the
bottom
line
was
right,
in
the
conclusion
that
when
there
is
an
ongoing
violation
and
the
other
requirements
for
relief
are
met,
monell/the
1983
causation
requirement
doesn't
impose
an
incremental
burden
on
the
plaintiff.
it
is
necessarily
satisfied
by
the
other
things
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
prove.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
uh-huh.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
continuing
violation
here
is
that
every
day
for
the
past
9
years,
our
respondents
have
suffered
a
violation
of
their
due
process
rights,
because
they
have
not
been
given
any
sufficient
process
to
show
that
they
are
wrongfully
included
in
the
index.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
twice
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
twice
said--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
think
it
is,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
we--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--think
it
is
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
there
is
that
inaction
here,
because
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
agree,
your
honor,
but
--
but
by
--
by
issuing
a
declaratory
judgment
and
by
finding
that
there
was
no
standing
for
it
here,
the
lower
court
necessarily
concluded
that
the
city
--
that
there
that
was
the
readressability
element
was
satisfied
and
that
the
continuing
harm
element
was
satisfied.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
ninth
circuit,
i
think
devised
--
recognized
that
there
were
two
different
claims
in
this
case.
the
ninth
circuit
sent
it
back
for
what
might
be
a
different
questions,
which
is
damages
liability.
in
other
words,
damages,
the
question--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
issues,
i
think,
with
--
with
simply
saying
as
my
friend
does,
that
monell
applies.
for
the
damages
question,
for
example,
whether
the
damages
started
accruing
on
the
very
first
day
the
process
wasn't
--
wasn't
provided,
there
might
be
a
question
about
whether
on
that
day
there
was
a
municipal
policy
in
2002
when
this
controversy
started.
it
might
be
that
on
that
day
there
was
no
municipal
policy
one
way
or
the
other.
maybe
no
one
has
confronted
it.
maybe
nobody
confronted
it
until
2006.
but
i
think
one
thing
--
so
for
damages
there
is
a
somewhat
different
inquiry
which
is,
for
each
day
for
which
damages
are
claimed,
was
that
is
the
policy
requirement
met.
this
is
a
different
question
which
is
on
a
going
forward
basis
to
provide
--
to
--
to
be
entitled
to
the
prospective
relief,
what
kind
of
causation
is
made.
and
that's
exactly--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
it
is
not
necessarily
true
in
this
particular
case
that
the
policy
--
that
the
policy
was
in
effect
from
day
one
as
opposed
to
something
that
--
that
came
into
--
that
--
the
municipal
responsibility
might
not
have
come
to
pass
until
later
when
a
policymaker
--
the
city
might
say
when
--
when
these
decisions
were
additionally
--
initially
made,
no
policymaker
knew
what
our
process
was
for
determining
the
accuracy
fees.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
lawsuit
got
filed
and
in
2006
somebody
decided
because
the
city
took
the
position
in
the
lawsuit
and
has
--
has
determined
that
it
is
not
going
to
implement
a
policy--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
the
facts--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--if
--
if
--
if
the
damages
--
if
the
injunctive
test
is
satisfied,
yes.
from
the
time
that
that
is
satisfied--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
the
difference,
i
think,
your
honor,
is
to
recover
damages,
the
plaintiff
doesn't
have
to
show
that
the
other
elements
of
the
damages
claim
don't
encompass
the
kind
of
requirements
of
municipal
--
of
municipal
involvement
that
is
encompassed
within
the
other
elements
of
the
prospective
relief
claim.
so
when
a
case
has
both,
our
submission
is
that
there
is
no
need
--
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
to
show
something
more
to
show
causation
than
he
has
to
show
to
show
the
violation
and
to
show
the
entitlement
to
ongoing
relief.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
it
means
you
would
have
to
show
all
the
requisites
but
you
could
decide
that
you
just
want
to
collect
damages
from
the
day
you
filed
the
suit.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
there
might
be
a
question
about
the
precise
timing
on
which
a--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--on
which
--
it
might
not
be
the
actual
day
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
there
might
be
a
question
about
when
an
official
got
to
know.
this
--
this
suit
has
been
going
on
for
so
long.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
is
continuing
to
do.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
i
think
that
is
--
that
is
an
example,
to
go
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
question,
of
a
case
that
would
be
problematic.
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
the
--
when
the
district
judge
issues
his
--
says,
sorry,
city,
you
are
wrong,
this
--
this
employee
has
continued
to
engage
in
unconstitutional
action
up
until
today,
and
then
the
question
is,
should
the
--
should
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
be
entitled
to
some
prospective
relief
from
that
violation,
or
is
there
some
additional
requirement?
and
our
position
is,
once
that
showing
has
been
made
of
a
violation
and
once
a
showing
has
been
made
that
would
be
under
lyons
that
say,
yes,
the
city
--
this
is
attributable
to
the
city,
that
should
be
enough.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
under--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
the
alternative
is
to
say,
even
if
it
turns
out
that
there
is
unconstitutional
action
going
on,
that
the
city
has
become
aware
of,
that
the
plaintiff
who
shows
that
does
not
get
any
relief
and
has
to
continue
to
suffer
the
unconstitutional
violation
for
some
indefinite
period
of
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
at
the
time
of
the
lawsuit
the
plaintiff
can't
get
prospective
relief
against
anyone,
because
he
can't
get
prospective
relief
against
the
city.
my
colleague's
view
is
an
official
capacity
suit
against
the
city
employee
is
subject
to
the
same
limit.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but,
your
honor,
i
think
the
consequence
of
that
structure
is,
that
the
city
can
leave
the
employee
--
there
is
no
remedy
against
an
employee
who
is
engaging
in
unconstitutional
conduct.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
two
answers,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
do
have
the
power
to
do
it.
and
we
think
that's
settled
for
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
look,
they
sent
it
--
one
of
the
reasons
they
sent
it
back
was
to
--
for
--
so
that
the
procedures
could
be
provided
or
an
injunction
could
be
entered,
directing
the
county
to
do
what
the
statute
requires,
which
is
exercise
its
responsibility
under
the
statute
to
make
sure
that
the
submissions
are
accurate.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
if
i
accepted
that,
i
was
wrong,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
a
policy.
and
i
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
they
don't
have
to
know
that
their
conduct
is
unconstitutional.
and
the
other
thing
that
the
court
has--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i'm
not
sure
that
it's
the
act
of
defending
it
in
court,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
the
ongoing
conduct,
almost
certainly,
maybe
it
would
be
a
question
of
fact,
will
by
virtue
of
the
lawsuit
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
policymakers.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
think
that
courts
have
said
that
filing
a
lawsuit
is
an
impermissible
way
to
do
that.
and
i
think
that
it
could
be
done
by
a
letter
also.
but
the
court
has
said,
for
example,
that
there
is
a
deliberative
difference
prong
to
the
monell
retrospective
test
as
well.
so
that
if,
in
the
hypothetical
we
have
been
talking
about,
if
policymakers
know
of
the
ongoing
conduct
and
they
are
indifferent
to
it,
which
they
would
be
presumably
if
they
are
letting
it
continue,
that
that
might
be
satisfied.
but
--
but
to
us
that
just
goes
to
the
notion
that
it's
hard
to
come
up
with
a
situation
where
there
will
be
an
entitlement
to
injunctive
relief
and
the
requisite
causation
won't
be
satisfied,
and
therefore
saying
that
there
is
this
additional
element,
it
sort
of
creates
more
harm
than
good
because
it's
going
to
serve
--
on
a
search
warrant.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that's
the
only
thing
that
the
county
petitioned
from,
your
honor,
but
i
think
more
is
at
stake
here
because
if
this
rule
applied
then
it
would
not
only
preclude
attorneys
fees,
it
would
also
preclude
the
awarding
of
any
relief.
and
so
although
it
happens
to
arise
here
on
the
attorneys
fees
context,
but
if
this
causation
requirement
is
more
than
just
an
extra
box
to
check
in
terms
of
something
that's,
for
which
the
requirements
will
be
satisfied,
if
it
does
scream
out
some
cases,
then
it
will
not
just
mean
no
entitlement
for
attorney's
fees,
it
will
me
no
entitlement
to
prospective
relief
and
we
think
that
is
significant.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
think
properly
applied
it
shouldn't
screen
out
any
case
because--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
in
those
circumstances
where
the
public
is
not
a
party,
you
can
only
hold
the
public
party
liability
when
its
policy
actually
inflicted
that
injury.
these
people
re-apply
for
a
license
and
they're
denied
and
a
policymaker
knows
that,
then
they
absolutely
are
going
to
come
in
under
monell
and
i
think
it's
going
to
be
a
sign--
