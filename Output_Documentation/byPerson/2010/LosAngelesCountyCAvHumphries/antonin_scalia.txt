what
was
the
--
what
was
the
basis
for
that
exception,
that
declaratory
judgment
does
not
affect
the
fisc
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
does
--
it
does,
though,
if
you
have
attorneys'
fees.
what
--
what
was
the
total
attorneys'
fee
award
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
far
above?
like
what?
i
suspect--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
case
is
mostly
about
attorneys'
fees.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
get
the
individual
officer
who
is
denying
the
marriage
license
or
whatever
the
offensive
act
is.
you
could
sue
that
person
under
1983
and
get
--
and
get
injunctive
relief,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
same
statutory
language
that
you
are
relying
on,
right,
that
was
held
to
require
causation
in
the
one
case?
why
wouldn't
it
require
a
similar
causation
in
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
there
is
no
city
policy.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
test
would
be
the
same
going
forward,
right?
the
test
would
be
the
same--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
same
test
would
apply
to
both
damages,
going
forward
after
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
suit,
and
injunction
according
to
your
reasoning,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
from
the
time
the
lawsuit
is
filed
both
--
the
injunctive
test
will
also
be
the
damages
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
follow
this.
to
bring
a
damages
claim
do
you
have
to
show
past
damages,
or
can
you
just
collect
damages
from
the
date
you
filed
suit?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
in
--
if
that's
the
complaint
that
you
filed,
then
--
then
in
that
kind
of
a
suit
the
test
for
damages
and
the
test
for
injunction
would
be
precisely
the
same;
and
you
would
be
able
to
get
damages
on
the
basis
of
the
mere
fact
that
the
suit
exists,
right?
because
they
wouldn't
be
fighting
it
if
it
wasn't
their
policy.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pincus,
why
--
why
do
you
accept,
as
i
think
you
did
under
the
chief
justice's
question,
that
if
the
city
has
a
policy
which
it
believes
is
constitutional,
but
in
fact
is
unconstitutional,
that
is
not
a
city
policy
for
purposes
of
monell?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
you
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
they
think
it
is
a
policy,
it's
still
a
policy,
isn't
it?
