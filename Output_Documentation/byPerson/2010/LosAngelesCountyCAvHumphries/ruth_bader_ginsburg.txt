justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
objection
on
the
part
of
the
state.
the
state
was
to
pay
the
lion's
share
of
the
fees,
i
think
90
percent,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
state
is
not
contesting
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
is
the
"they"
who
would
do
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
getting
further
removed
from
the
situation
that
we're
dealing
with,
because
the
state
has
already
admitted
liability
and
not
contested
that
it
owes
fees.
so
what
is
the
relief
that
is
left?
if
the
state
has
admitted
liability,
what
happens
at
that
point?
shouldn't
the
record
be
expunged?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
state
has
already
conceded.
it's
been
adjudicated
a
constitutional
violator,
and
the
state
is
now
saying,
you
know,
we
are
not
going
to
contest
that
anymore.
doesn't
the
state
have
to
do
something?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
true
that
all
cases
that
at
least
come
to
us
under
monell
have
involved
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
is
not
what
the
ninth
circuit
--
the
ninth
circuit
said,
we
are
not
deciding
the
monell
question;
we
are
leaving
that
--
we
are
leaving
that
open.
but
monell
--
we
are
not
deciding
because
monell
doesn't
apply
to
forward
relief
--
declaratory
relief
or
injunctive
relief.
and
so
the
ninth
circuit
has
rejected
the
statement
in
monell
itself
that
it
applies
to
all
forms
of
relief.
and
so
that's
the
question
we
are
confronted
with.
because
we
have
had
experience
in
monell
cases
only
with
damage
actions,
was
--
was
the
monell
decision
wrong
in
saying
that
that
framework
applies
to
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
realize
that
--
the
ninth
circuit
to
have
said,
there
is
a
policy
whatever,
because
the
city's
notice
and
they
have
done
nothing
about
it,
therefore--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
say
that.
it
said
we
are
not
going
to
decide
monell
liability;
we
are
just
going
to
say
monell
doesn't
apply.
and
if
you
are
just
thinking
well,
what's
at
stake?
you
say,
all
of
our
cases
involve
damages,
that's
money.
what
is
involved
here?
attorneys'
fees,
that's
money.
so
where
do
we
bracket
this?
do
we
bracket
this
with
the
--
with
damages,
because
that's
money,
and
that's
what's
involved
here,
attorneys'
fees?
and
the
only
thing
it
supports
is
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees,
right?
