chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-350,
los
angeles
county
v.
humphries.
mr.
coates.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
concede,
i
take
it,
or
acknowledge
that
one
episode
can
be
the
basis
--
i
mean,
going
forward
--
for
a
determination
that
the
defendant
has
a
policy,
custom,
or
practice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
they
have
sued
the
state
here,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
under
ex
parte
young?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that's
what
you
think.
so
you
agree
--
it
struck
me
that
your
argument
could
have
been
made
by
your
friend
on
the
other
side.
you
say
if
you
get
an
injunction,
you
must
have
shown
municipal
policy,
practice,
or
custom,
and
therefore,
you
agree
that
a
municipal
policy,
custom,
or
practice
is
required.
that's
what
he
thinks.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
monell
doesn't
apply
to
state
officials,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that,
of
course,
isn't
before
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
would
require
--
that
would
require
us
to
get
into
the
question
of
whether
ex
parte
young
is
a
fiction
or
substance,
which
i
certainly
wouldn't
like
to
get
into.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer's
question
said
you
need
a
city
policy,
and
you
said
that's
exactly
right.
so
i
think
the
case
is
over.
the
issue
is
whether
you
need
a
city
policy,
and
your
friend
thinks
so,
and
you
think
so.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
think
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
your
friend
agrees.
but
--
but
how
can
the
city
have
caused
the
violation
in
the
absence
of
a
city
policy,
custom,
or
practice?
you
say
you
have
to
show
causation
to
get
an
injunction.
the
only
way
to
show
that
the
city
caused
the
problem
is
to
show
that
they
have
got
a
policy,
custom
or
practice,
including
one
that
might
be
shown
by
inaction.
but
you
still
have
to
show
that
and
that's
all
monell
requires.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
you
are
arguing
whether
monell
was
satisfied
or
not,
and
you
are
get
ago
chance
to
do
that
on
remand
because
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
we
are
giving
--
we
are
making
the
city
pay
and
now
we
are
finding
out
if
they
violating
anything.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
to
send
it
back
for
a
hearing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
you
have
already
shown
monell
was
satisfied.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but,
yes,
damages,
but
turning
on
whether
monell
was
satisfied.
it
was
a
hearing
about
monell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
can
you
get
relief
--
how
can
you
get
relief
going
forward
under
monell
unless
there
has
been
a
city
violation
before?
otherwise
what
the
injunction
you
were
getting
is
just
an
injunction
saying
don't
violate
the
law
and
the
city
has
said
we
haven't,
because
you
haven't
shown
that
we
have
policy,
practice,
or
custom.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
were
sued--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
not
--
defending
the
suit
doesn't
give
rise
to
a
municipal
custom,
policy
or
practice?
they
may
have
--
somebody
comes
in
and
says
this
what's
going
on
and
they
may
say,
well,
we
don't
--
we
dont'
think
that's
unconstitutional.
so
they
are
going
to
defend
the
suit.
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
adopted
a
policy
to
do
what
they
--
the
individual
employee
has
been
alleged
to
have
done.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
or
continuing
to
do,
i
mean,
the
suit
doesn't
satisfy
the
requirement
of
showing
a
policy
or
practice,
because
they
may
defend
on
the
ground
that
it
is
not
unconstitutional.
they
may
say,
look,
this
isn't
our
policy,
this
isn't
our
practice,
but
we
are
going
to
defend
our
employee
because
we
don't
think
it
is
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
so
the
city--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
city
is
in
a
catch-22
position.
whenever
they
are
sued,
they
have
to
say
if
we
defend
this,
we
are
going
to
be
liable
under
monell;
but
if
we
don't
defend
it,
then,
you
know,
our
policy
is
being
changed.
or
we
might
--
we
might
want
to
have
this
policy,
we
might
not.
we
didn't
know
this
clerk
was
doing
that,
but
we
might
think
it's
a
good
idea,
we
might
think
it's
a
bad
idea.
the
cases
are
not
always
going
to
be
as
clear
as
the
hypotheticals
in
your
brief.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
bit
much
to
tell
the
city,
when
you
have
to
choose
whether
to
defend
a
suit,
you
are
in
fact
choosing
what
policy
or
practice
to
have
going
forward.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you've
got
to
get
relief
against
the
city.
because
the
city
is
not
responsible
for
what
happened
until
they
adopt
a
policy,
practice
or
custom.
now
if
they
are
told
this
is
unconstitutional
and
they
decide
to
stick
with
it,
then
they're
--
that's
their
policy
and
custom
and
you
can
get
an
injunction
against
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
is
not
--
he
is
not
entitled
to
prospective
relief
against
the
city,
because
the
city
has
not
caused
the
alleged
harm.
until
you
establish
a
policy,
practice
or
custom.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
establish
what
the
employee
is
doing
in
a
suit
against
the
employee,
which
the
city
is
defending
because
he's
one
of
their
employees,
then
the
city
is
put
to
a
choice.
once
--
i
suppose
once
the
legal
process
has
concluded
they
have
to
decide
whether
they
have
to
continue
that
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
i'd
like
the
answer
to
is
whether
or
not
merely
defending
the
employee
in
court
is
sufficient
to
establish
that
the
city
has
that
policy,
custom
or
practice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
sure.
sure.
you
are
back
where
justice
--
justice
alito
was
commenting,
well,
that
at
some
point
you
have
to
bring
what
you
were
complaining
about
to
the
attention
of
the
city.
you
dismiss
that
as
an
exhaustion
requirement,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
coates,
you
have
13
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
