mr.
timothy
t.
coates
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
monell
v.
department
of
social
services,
this
court
held
there
could
be
no
liability
against
a
local
public
entity
under
section
1983
unless
the
plaintiff
proved
causation,
namely
that
the
injury
that
was
inflicted
was
inflicted
as
a
result
of
a
custom,
policy,
or
practice
of
that
local
public
entity.
the
ninth
circuit,
however,
in
this
case
has
imposed
ex
post
facto
declaratory
relief
on
the
county
of
los
angeles
as
well
as
a
substantial
fee
award,
while
acknowledging
that
it
has
not,
in
fact,
determined
whether
the
injury
suffered
by
the
plaintiffs
and
subject
to
declaratory
relief
was
the
result
of
a
policy,
custom,
or
practice
fairly
attributable
to
the
county
of
los
angeles.
it
did
so
because
the
ninth
circuit
has
developed
a
digression
from
the
court's
jurisprudence
in
monell;
namely,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
claims
for
prospective
relief,
both
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief,
are
not
subject
to
the
monell
requirements.
we
submit
that
this
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
monell
and
it
erodes
the
important
principles
of
federalism
that
are
the
motivating
factors
for
the
monell
causation
requirement.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
yes,
essentially
in
the--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--as
to
the
county,
it's
$58,000.
but
the
overall
award
is
far
above
that,
and
that's
just
for
appellate
attorneys'
fees.
we
were
not
even
talking
trial
fees
at
this
time.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
600-and-some-odd
thousand
dollars.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
correct.
the
state
has
not
contested
that.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
the
state
has
not
contested
that,
correct.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
yes,
yes.
it's
a
suit
against
the
state
under
an
ex
parte
young
theory,
since
they
maintain
the
statute.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
it
would
have
to
be--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--it
would
have
to
be
--
the
court
has
recognized,
against
local
municipalities,
liability
under
section
1983.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
in
a
direct
civil
cause
of
action,
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
that
is
correct.
you
can
also
sue
the
individual.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
the
individual,
for
a
federal
constitutional
remedy?
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
no,
i
believe
you
would
still
have
to
have
an
operative
statute.
to
get
it
into
federal
court
for
declaratory
relief
requires
some--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--i
believe
for
a
constitutional
claim
of
this
type,
it
would
be
section
1983.
you
might
find
an
employment
case
where
you
might
have
title
vii
concerns.
it
depends
on
the
right
that
you
are
talking
that
is
at
issue.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
are
we
talking
about
the
state,
or
are
you
referring
to
the
municipality?
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
you
would
not,
unless
you
showed
that
there
was
a
policy,
custom,
or
practice.
you
might
have
the
one
outlying--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
no.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
say,
for
example,
that
once
brought
to
the
attention
of
a
policymaking
official
that
this
is
what
was
going
on,
then
you
have
the
deliberate
indifference
by
a
policymaking
official.
i
submit
that
under
monell,
that
might
provide
a
basis
under
the
court's
case
law.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
the
difficulty
in
this
case
is
with
respect
to
that
there
are
no
state
standards
in
terms
of
evaluating
the
accuracy
or
when
someone
is
removed,
when
someone
wants
to
be
removed
from
the
database.
even
ninth
circuit
recognized
that,
that
it
was
going
to
impose
on
local
public
entities
through
the
back
door,
that
there
are
no
specific
criteria
in
the
statute
for
removing
someone
from
--
from
the
list.
and
that
would
require
the
county
to
start
trying
to
create
its
own
policy
or
own
procedural
schemes.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
because
it's
not
so
much
that
they
are
inaccurate;
it's
the
standards
used
to
remove
someone
from
the
list
or
not.
because
we
may
have
information
showing
culpability,
information
showing
not
culpability,
but
we
don't
have
a
standard
to
tell
us
when
to
remove
them
from
the
database
and
when
to
leave
them
in,
because
that's
defined
by
the
state.
more
importantly,
we
don't
have
any
procedures
on
how
to
go
about
that,
because
the
statutory
scheme
doesn't
have
any
for
doing
that.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
correct.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
that's
true.
that
could
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
a
policymaker.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
correct.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
no,
i
agree
with
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
think
that
most
of
these
cases
--
these
cases
do
fit
neatly
within
the
monell
framework
if
a
plaintiff
pursues
them
within
that
framework.
the
ninth
circuit
doesn't
require
that,
though,
and
kind
of
just
simply
lumps
the
county
together
with
the
state
and
says
the
state
statute's
unconstitutional.
you
are
charged
with
enforcing
it.
declaratory
relief
against
both
of
you.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
you
can.
if
you
have
a
policymaker
who
understands
the
situation,
makes
a
deliberate
decision,
yes,
i
think
can
you
come
forward
with
a
monell.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
the
one
thing
i
said
that
it
wasn't
doing
is
figuring
out
whether
this
met
the
policy,
custom,
or
practice
requirement
of
monell,
because
under
its
case
law
it
doesn't
have
to
do
so.
and
in
fact,
in
the
fee
order,
it
said
--
declined
to
do
so
and,
in
fact,
it
has
remanded
on
the
damage
portion
of
the
case,
acknowledging
that
the
monell
claims
remain
open.
we
also
contend
that
for
purposes
of
potential
monell
liability
that
we
may
not
be
free
under
state
law
to
add
additional
procedural
protections.
that
area
may
be
preempted
by
the
state
through
implied
preemption
under
california
law.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
the
way
the
lower
courts
have,
in
the
context
of
liability,
viewed
this
requirement
where
state
law
requires
a
local
entity
to
do
something
is
they
have
virtually
said
that
they
are
standing
in
the
shoes
of
the
state.
under
those
circumstances,
it's
essentially
the
state
making
the
decision.
they
are
just
using
the
county
as
a
--
as
the
local
entity,
as
an
instrument.
and
so
it's
essentially
an
ex
parte
young
eleventh
amendment-type
case.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
they
have,
yes.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
they
have
indeed
sued
the
state
here
and
we
submit
that
they
can
get
full
relief
with
respect
to
the
database
from
the
state,
should
they
choose
to
pursue
that.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
they
may--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--they
have
sued
the
attorney
general,
though
the
department
of
justice
maintains
the
database.
the
department
of
justice
issues
the
regulations
on
how
local
entities
go
about
--
are
required
to
report
to
the
database.
so
that
is
the
defendant
in
this
case,
and
that
is
who
they
would
sue.
i
submit
they
could
get
relief
by
being
removed
from
the
database
or
require
the
state
to
enact
procedures
to
allow
them
to
have
a
determination
made
as
to
whether
they
should
be
removed
or
not.
as
it
now
stands,
the
statutory
scheme
doesn't
have
that
and
the
county's
view
is
that
it's
not
free
to
just
go
out
and
invent
procedures,
and
other
counties
in
the
state
of
california
aren't
free
to
invent
their
own
procedures.
that's
one
of
the
elements
of
this
case
that
i
think
really
underscores
the
monell
concerns
with
federalism,
because
it's
an
important
question
of
the
manner
in
which
states
relate
to
the
municipalities
and
the
way
states
divide
up
responsibility
for
who
does
what,
and
in
a
fairly
important
area
of
the
law.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
there
would
be
a
possible
preemption
argument.
they
could
halt
california
--
they
could
halt
los
angeles
from
enacting
the
statute,
from
utilizing
the
procedural
protections.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
they
could
say
it
is
preempted
and
move
for
an
injunction
from
doing
it,
because
they
are
interested
in
maintaining
the
database.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
the
state
of
california
would
come
in
and
argue
that
the
county
was
preempted
from
using
these
regulations.
they
would
argue
that
it
slows
down
the
database
or
what
have
you.
but
they
could
theoretically
do
that
under
california
law.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
i
believe
the
appropriate
remedy
for
the
plaintiffs
would
be
to
apply
in
a
district
court
if
they
believe
they
have
a
valid
injunction
on
valid
declaratory
relief
vis-a-vis
the
state
and
move
forward
from
there.
they
could
certainly
do
that
and
have
themselves
removed
from
the
database
or
order
the
state
to
create
statutory
procedures
to
allow
them
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
they
should
be
removed
from
the
database.
they
are
perfectly
free
to
do
that,
because
it's
the
state
statute
and
it's
the
state
database,
and
the
state
is
a
party
here.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
they
should.
they
absolutely
should.
and
if
the
state
drags
its
feet,
the
appropriate
remedy
is
to
file
a
motion
for
an
injunction
as
against
the
state,
to
have
them
issue
the
proper
procedural
protections
or
to
remove
them
from
the
database.
but
we
submit
that
at
this
point,
it
is
not
appropriate
relief
as
against
the
county.
that
issue
still
remains
open.
we
can
still
go
back
into
district
court
and
lose
that,
but
at
this
point
you
still
have
to
make
the
inquiry,
whether
it's
a
county
policy,
custom,
or
practice
that
is
inflicting
the
injury
that
is
the
subject
of
declaratory
relief
here.
and,
i
mean,
i
think
at
bottom,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
point
is
that
plaintiffs
really
haven't
identified
any
circumstance
in
which,
in
a
proper
case
applying
the
monell
standards,
you
would
not
be
able
to
get
relief.
and
the
danger
of
going
forward
with
the
ninth
circuit's
kind
of
amorphous
standard
where
you
just
compose
declaratory
relief
independent
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
policy,
custom,
or
practice,
the
kind
of
sloppy
order
that
we
have
here,
granting
declaratory
relief
where
we
have
a
90-10
fee
split
and
it
is
unclear
how
that
decision
was
made,
because
it
is
not
made
through
the
prism
of
any
sort
of
causation
standard
articulated
by
this
court.
so
we
would
submit
that
monell
provides
clear
guidelines,
although
sometimes
difficult
to
apply
in
certain
cases,
but
they
are
clear
guidelines.
and
the
court
in
monell
said
that
those
causation
requirements
applied
to
damages,
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief,
and
we
believe
that
is
a
solid
rule
that
supports
the
interests
of
federalism
and--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--that
is
correct.
they
have
been
damages
cases.
but
the
--
but
monell
itself
doesn't
talk
in
terms
of
guarding
the
public
fisc,
which
is
how
chaloux,
the
ninth
circuit
case
that
departs
from
monell
with
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief,
the
way
it
characterizes
it,
doesn't.
monell
was
concerned
with
interpreting
the
language
of
section
1983,
the
shall
subjective:
"shall
cause
someone
else
to
subject
a
person
to
a
violation.
"
they
said
that
did
not
really
conform
to
respondeat
superior
principles.
and
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
the
42nd
congress
in
enacting
section
1983
was
critical
to
justice
in
monell
with
the
rejection
of
the
sherman
amendment,
which
he
said
was
concerned
mostly
with
not
imposing
coercive
liability
on
the
municipality
for
the
actions
of
others.
they
were
concerned
not
to
save
money
necessarily,
but
the
way
in
which
a
federal
court
would
exercise
coercive
power
over
a
public
entity.
and
we
submit
that
it
is
just
as
important
to
have
those
guidelines
when
directly
coercing
through
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
as
it
is
indirectly
doing
it
through
the
threat
of
damage
claims.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
via
section
1983--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--yes,
that's
my
recollection.
that's
my
recollection.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
off
the
top
of
my
head--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
i
mean,
it
is
independent
of
what
remedies
might
occur
under
state
law.
i'm
not
trying
to
say
that
that's
the
exclusive
--
that
section
1983
is
the
exclusive
means
for
all
relief.
you
can
certainly
there
state--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--my
understanding
with
respect
to
a
general
constitutional
claim
is
it
is
section
1983.
that
is
how
congress
has
specified
the
remedy.
there
are
other
portions
for
other
types
of
conduct
--
section
1986,
section
1985,
for
example
--
but
i
think
the
sort
of
general
constitutional
claim
is
subject
to
section
1983.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
i
think
it's
telling
that
we
don't
have
an
example
of
circumstances
where
applying
the
monell
standards
someone
couldn't
get
prospective
relief
where
it
was
appropriate
where
the
injury
was
actually
inflicted
by
the
municipality.
i
think
plaintiff's
view
is
that
it's
kind
of
a
tail
wagging
the
dog,
that
having
established
declaratory
relief
that
establishes
causation.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
assuming
that
the
city's
acceptance
of
that
policy
wasn't
what
led
the
clerk
to
make
that
decision.
it
sounds
like
you
are
talking
more
of
a
ratification
type
thing
on
consideration.
yeah,
we
think
he
did
the
right
thing.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
no.
i'm
saying
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
you
have
a
policymaker
that
specifically
ratifies
and
says
this
is
affirmatively
our
policy,
we
think
it's
correct,
as
opposed
to
legalizing
it.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
in
the
second
lawsuit
the
municipality
is
being
held
liable
for
its
unconstitutional
conduct.
that's
because
the
injury
in
the
second
case
is
absolutely
inflicted
as
a
result
of
a
municipal
policy,
custom
or
practice.
that's
why.
in
the
first
one
you
are
talking
about,
an
injury
that
has
inflicted
by
the
employee,
significant
point
here,
again,
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
recognizes
because,
again,
it
didn't
apply
to
monell
in
granting
declaratory
relief
and
issuing
the
attorneys
fees,
it
conspicuously
did
not.
it
expressly
reserves
the
monell
issue
in
the
main
opinion.
it
did
so
because
on
rehearing
the
initial
opinion
didn't
say
anything
about
monell.
on
rehearing
we
pointed
out
that
those
issues
were
still
open,
more
specifically
the
issue
of
whether
we
were
even
free
under
california
law
to
create
these
additional
procedures.
that
issue
remains
in
this
case.
it's
a
significant
issue.
even
the
ninth
circuit
admits
that.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
lower
courts
in
talking
about
this
issue
in
the
context
of
monell
claims
against
the
local
public
have
said
if
you
are
just
enforcing
state
law,
if
you
have
no
discretion,
you
are
not
making
a
conscious
decision,
you
have
to
do
this
under
state
law,
you
are
essentially
acting
as
an
arm
of
the
state
eleventh
amendment
ex
parte
young.
i
think
we
cite
the
bockes
case,
which
is
an
employment
case
where
they
sue
the
local
entity
for
employment
decisions
that
were
dictated
by
its
state--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
the
constitutional
concern
is
that
it
injects
a
federal
court
in
a
very
direct
into
the
way
municipalities
operate
under
california
law.
injunctive
relief
it's
even
worse.
to
issue
an
injunction
against
the
county
saying
you
have
to
do
these
procedural
protections,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
state
says
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
do
that,
is
inviting
a
lack
of
uniformity
in
these
procedures
throughout
the
state,
and
the
state
might
want
uniformity.
if
you
hold
a
public
entity
automatically
liable
for
declaratory
injunctive
relief
for
--
for
enforcing
state
law,
you
really
have
circumstances
where
a
local
entity
is
going
to
say
we
don't
need
this
fight.
we
are
not
going
to
enforce
this
law.
it
may
be
defensible,
but
we
are
it's
not
on
our
dime.
and
then
you
get
local
entities
not
enforcing
state
law,
and
that
seems
to
be
a
significant
state
interest.
and
i
submit
that
these
are
the
kind
of
federalism
principles
that,
you
know,
mozell
--
monell
is
designed
to
take
into
account.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
they
will
have
to
--
whether
we
--
yes,
i
believe
they
will,
to
determine
whether,
in
fact,
it's
a
county
policy
or
custom.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
it's
very
much
like
the
mcmillian
--
the
mcmillian
case,
your
honor,
with
the
--
the
--
the
state
sheriff
in
alabama,
who's
a
county
sheriff,
and
the
question
was,
for
monell
purposes,
does
he
act
on
behalf
of
the
state
or
does
he
act
on
behalf
of
the
county?
and
the
court
said
that
determination
is
informed
by
state
law.
it
ends
up
being
a
question
of
federal
law,
but
it
is
informed
by
state
law.
so,
the
short
answer
is
the
court
does
that
all
the
time
in
monell
damages
actions--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--correct.
correct.
that
is
the
chaloux
case
in
which
they
said
that
monell
simply
doesn't
apply.
we
are
not
going
to
ask
whether
he's
acting
as
a
state
official
or
a
county
official--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
ninth
circuit.
other
circuits
have
been
very
careful
in
drawing
that
distinction
as
to
how
counties
officers
--
how
counties
function.
as
i
noted,
i
think
this
goes
to
important
principles
of
federalism.
it
goes
right
into
the
way
the
states
interact
with
their
local
governments.
and
it
can
have
a
profound
impact
on
the
way
in
which
local
governments
view
their
obligation
to
enforce
state
law.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
submit
the
matter.
