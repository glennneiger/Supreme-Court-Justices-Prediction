justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
respondents
here
argue
that,
don't
they?
that
you
should
have
created
a
procedure
on
your
own,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
if
the
--
presumably,
that
could
be
brought
to
the
--
that
could
be
brought
before
someone
who
is
a
county
policymaker,
couldn't
it,
when
you
are
talking
about
something
that's
going
--
that's
ongoing
in
the
future?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
then
that
would
fall
within
monell.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
that's
why
i'm
somewhat
puzzled
about
what
this
case
is
about.
when
are
we
going
to
get
into
a
situation
in
which
the
plaintiffs
are
asking
for
prospective
relief
and
the
matter
cannot
be
brought
before
a
municipal
or
county
policymaker?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
if
that's
the
case,
why
wouldn't
one
of
the
following
be
possible?
if
you
--
you
say
we
have
no
discretion
here,
we
are
required
--
we
are
totally
bound
by
the
state
procedures;
we
can't
add
any
new
procedure.
they
say,
well,
that's
unconstitutional.
so
--
and
you
are
choosing
to
do
something
that
is
unconstitutional
that
is
required
by
state
law.
in
that
situation,
won't
you
have
adopted
a
policy?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
an
ex
parte
young
situation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
happen
under
california
law
if
you
said,
we
agree
with
the
respondents
that
additional
procedures
are
constitutionally
required,
so
even
though
california
law
doesn't
allow
this,
we
are
going
to
create
these
procedures
because
we
have
to
comply
with
the
constitution.
what
would
your
situation
be
under
california
law?
would
you
be
subject
to
--
what
could
the
state
do
to
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
have
a
question
similar
to
justice
sotomayor's.
suppose
we
were
to
hold
that
the
monell
requirement
applies
to
prospective
relief,
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
can
you
provide
an
example
of
just
an
unacceptable
consequence
that
would
follow
from
that
holding,
a
situation
in
which
that
holding
would,
in
your
judgment,
be
one
that
we
would
not
want
to
accept?
well,
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
now
we
have
a
situation.
the
clerk
denies
the
marriage
license.
and
then
i
presume
you
can
take
the
matter
before
a
municipal
policymaker,
and
the
municipal
policymaker
will
say,
this
is
our
policy,
license
denied,
or
this
is
not
our
policy.
and
then
monell
is
satisfied,
right?
if
the
policymaker
says,
it
is
our
policy
to
deny
licenses
under
these
circumstances,
that's
a
policy.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
still
waiting
to
hear
what
cases
it
will
screen
out.
i
haven't
heard
an
example
of
a
case
that
it
would
screen
out.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
whether
you
were
free
to
do
it
or
not
under
california
law,
how
can
there
not
--
how
can
it
not
be
your
policy
that
you
have
refused
to
provide
these
procedures
which
they
say
are
constitutionally
required?
your
policy
is
to
follow
an
arguably
unconstitutional
state
requirement
rather
than
comply
with
what
is
arguably
required
by
the
constitution.
why
isn't
that
a
policy?
now,
all
that's
at
stake
is
--
and
of
course
it's
a
matter
of
practical
importance,
but
all
that's
at
stake
is
a
monetary
dispute
between
the
state
of
california
and
the
county
of
los
angeles,
which
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned,
is
the
same
thing
as
the
state
of
california.
so
why
should
we
be
concerned
about
this
at
all?
i
don't
understand
why
there
is
not
a
policy
here.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
but
all
that
is
involved
is
money
between
--
between
california
and
a
creature
of
california.
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned,
california
could
abolish
the
county
of
los
angeles.
california
could
subsidize
you
for
your
attorneys
fees
or
they
could
levy
some
sort
of
--
something
upon
you
and
require
you
to
pay
them
additional
money.
none
of
that
--
what's
the
constitutional
concern
in
all
of
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
do
you
think
that
the
federal
court
has
to
decide
the
issue
of
california
law,
namely,
whether
you
have
freedom
under
this
particular
statute
to
add
an
additional
procedures
to
the
california
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
something
that
should
be
decided
in
state
court?
why
isn't
this
a
beef
between
the
state
and
the
state's
creature,
the
county
of
los
angeles?
