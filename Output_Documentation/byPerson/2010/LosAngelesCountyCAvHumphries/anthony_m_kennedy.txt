does
the
state
make
that
payment
under
an
ex
parte
young
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
sue
the
municipality,
if
they
deny
a
marriage
license,
do
you
have
to
sue
under
1983,
or
you
can
just
sue
alleging
a
federal
cause
of
action
under
--
because
of
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
be
like
a
bivens
action,
i
guess.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
only
way
to
sue
a
municipality
for
a
constitutional
violation
is
under
1983?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
could
you
sue
outside
of
1983?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
to
get
--
the
marriage
license
example
--
just
to
get
an
order
demanding
issuance
of
the
license.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
has
to
be
a
statute
--
it
has
to
be
1983?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
bivens
actions
be
brought
against
municipalities?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
cite
the
authority
for
--
would
--
do
you
think
that
the
rationale
for
that
is
that
since
congress
has
created
an
express
cause
of
action,
this
impliedly
preempts
a
bivens-type
action.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
have
--
have
we
said
that
in
a
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
seems
to
me
it
would
help
you
in
this
case,
because
you
would
say,
well,
if
there's
a
real
problem,
the
city
--
the
injured
party
can
sue
for
an
injunction.
perhaps
the
state
was
against
the
party
first,
and
he
can
--
he
can
raise
a
constitutional
defense
or
he
can
bring
an
action
for
an
injunction,
and
it
doesn't
have
to
be
under
1983.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
would
resolve
it.
and
you
then
wouldn't
have
to
pay
attorneys'
fees
because
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i'm
talking
about
under
federal
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
you
are
not
really
hurt,
or
the
system
isn't
really
hurt
by
the
rule
that
the
city
asks
for.
if
it's
so
easy
to
establish
a
policy
or
custom
requirement
in
cases
where
prospective
relief
is
sought,
then
that's
the
answer.
you
can
establish
it.
end
of
case.
but
you
don't
get
it
unless
you
establish
the
custom
and
practice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
submission.
and
it
could
be
i'm
just
obtuse
on
this
point.
i
interpret
your
remarks
as
saying
that
monell
does
apply
when
there
is
an
injunction.
do
i
misinterpret
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
answer
is
it's
so
easy
to
do,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
well,
then,
why
are
we
here?
why
isn't
the
city
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
not?
the
ninth
circuit
did
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
agree
with
that
statement,
yes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
california
itself
or
the
ninth
circuit
had
a
case
in
which
the
county
sheriff
was
directed
by
a
judge
to
garnish
certain
wages
or
certain
accounts,
the
sheriff
had
no
choice,
apparently,
other
than
to
follow
the
judge,
and
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
monell
is
not
required
when
you
seek
declaratory
relief
against
future
actions,
and
so
attorneys
fees
are
given.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
doesn't
make
any
difference?
