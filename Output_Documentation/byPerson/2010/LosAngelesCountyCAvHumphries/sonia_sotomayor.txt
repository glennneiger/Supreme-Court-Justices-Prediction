justice
sonia
sotomayor
--ignore
the
injunction,
can
you
go
to
the
state
and
force
the
state
to
--
in
that
circumstance,
to
get
someone
to
issue
the
license
on
your
behalf?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
the
municipality.
i
misspoke.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
you
are
saying
is
that
a
state
agent
or
a
municipality
can
continue
to
ignore
a
constitutional
violation
until,
what
--
you
are
denied
the
license
five
times?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
times
do
you
have
to
show
that
you
are
not
getting
that
license
that
you
are
entitled
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
what
do
you
do
with
ancra
section
11178(a)(2),
which
tells
you
that
the
municipality
is
responsible
for
the
accuracy,
completeness,
and
retention
of
the
reports
sent
to
the
state?
it's
not
your
policy
to
ignore
your
obligation
and
not
figure
out
what
to
do
about
the
retentions
of
improperly
submitted
names?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
what
it
is
charged
with
doing.
it
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
the
accuracy,
completeness,
and
retention
of
these
reports.
so
if
you're
charged
with
the
accuracy,
completeness,
and
retention
of
the
reports,
why
shouldn't
you
be
responsible
for
the
failure
to
maintain
accurate
reports?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
your
adversary's
argument,
which
is
by
this
lawsuit,
you
have
been
told
that
there's
something
wrong.
it
seems
pretty
natural
that
a
report
would
be
kept
on
the
registry.
that
is
then
declared
just
plain
wrong.
the
court
has
said
there
is
no
foundation
whatsoever
for
the
accuracy
of
what's
in
that
report,
and
you
have
failed
to
establish
a
procedure
to
remove
the
name.
why
aren't
you
viable
under
monell?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
who
would
they
sue
to
do
that?
as
i
am
reading
ancra,
it
makes
the
california
department
of
justice
only
the
repository
of
reports.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
who
--
who
do
they
sue
in
the
state
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
could
you
stop
talking
in
the
abstract--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
give
me
an
example.
give
me
an
example
of
a
situation
where
a
state
official
under
ex
parte
young
has
been
held
to
have
violated
the
constitution
where
a
monell
finding
had
not
been
applied
already.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
i
was
trying
to
do
just
an
analogy
in
terms
of
--
because
one
of
his
arguments
has
been
that
ex
parte
young
doesn't
have,
inherently,
a
monell
requirement.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
--
i'm
still
--
i
am
sort
of
asking
for
a
hypothetical
and
to
take
it
from
the
abstract.
tell
me
what's
--
here,
you
define
the
ongoing
violation
as
the
failure
to
institute
procedures,
i'm
assuming,
to
remove
a
name
from
the
registry,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
ongoing
failure
that
you
are
alleging
entitles
you
to
injunctive
relief?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
was
it
that
you
thought
the
city
could
remove
the
name?
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
it
is
that
you
think
--
what
was
the
continuing
violation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
to
prove
a
future
violation,
you
have
to
show
that
the
municipality
can
do
that;
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
so
why
isn't
that
a
policy,
practice,
or
custom?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
understand:
how--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--their
failure
or
omission
could
be
anything
but.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
they
gave
you
an
example.
clerk
says
i'm
not
giving
marriage
license
to
interracial
couples.
i
think
that's
constitutional.
clerk
resigns
and
the
municipality
says
we
think
he
was
right,
that's
constitutional.
it's
not
our
policy.
we
didn't
really
think
about
it,
but
we
think
it's
constitutional.
you're
arguing
that
because
it
was
the
agent
who
made
that
decision,
was
the
city
had
no
policy,
you
can't
give
injunctive
relief
ordering
the
city
to
give
you
a
license.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
is
that
different
from
what
the
chief
justice
proposed,
which
is,
no,
we
didn't
have
a
policy,
but
we
are
going
to
defend
you
anyway
because
we
think
it's
okay.
now
you
are
calling
that
a
policy?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
are
not
going
to
say
that,
they
are
going
to
say,
policy,
no
policy,
we
don't
even
think
that
way.
what
he
did
was
okay,
we're
going
to
defend
that,
it's
constitutional.
and
the
court
says
what
he
did
is
not
constitutional.
x
has
to
be
done
instead.
by
you,
the
municipality,
even
though
the
agents
that
you
had
before
was
acting
on
his
or
her
own.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
we
are
now
going
to
have
a
situation
where
what
you
are
proposing
is
that
you
have
to
sue
the
individual
actor,
get
a
ruling
on
the
constitutionality
of
whatever
is
being
done,
and
then
let
that
suit
finish
and
ask
the
municipality
to
perform
or
not
perform,
and
if
it
doesn't
then
you
relitigate
all
these
issues?
