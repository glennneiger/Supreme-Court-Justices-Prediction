justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you
clarify
for
me
what
your
exact
meaning
is?
there
--
your
blue
brief
and
your
reply
brief
appear
to
give
two
different
meanings.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
reply
brief
suggests
that
if
omega
grants
foreign
reproduction
and
distribution
rights
but
retains
u.s.
rights,
that
the
first
sale
doctrine
would
allow
omega
to
bar
importation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
does
it
matter?
because
your
blue
brief
says
that
"lawfully
made"
means
anything
that
was
made
with
omega's
consent
or
authority.
so
why
the
difference
at
all?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
he
sells
his
rights
to
a
foreign
manufacturer
and
distributor,
he
gets
paid
for
those
rights.
why
should
he
now
have
any
additional
rights
to
bar
that
authorized
copy--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--from
being
imported
into
the
united
states?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
don't
understand
what--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--not
--
you
mean
to
the
examples
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
examples
in
quality
king?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
do
you
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
assigning
a
copyright
to
a
foreign
entity
or
merely
licensing
a
foreign
entity?
one
of
the
criticisms
of
your
approach
is
that
you
would
draw
a
line
between
those
two.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
you
are
trying
to
rewrite
quality
king.
now
you
are
saying
that
the
entire
premise
of
quality
king
is
wrong.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
in
quality
king
do
you
see
anything
quality
king
turning
on
where
the
goods
were
made?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
read
the
decision
and
it
barely
mentions
that,
if
at
all.
its
whole
premise
was
on
what
the
owner
did:
did
the
owner
sell
this
copy?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
don't
we
let--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--why
don't
we
let
contract
law
control
the
violations
of
any
agreements
with
foreigners?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
with
respect
to
manufacturing
and
distribution?
