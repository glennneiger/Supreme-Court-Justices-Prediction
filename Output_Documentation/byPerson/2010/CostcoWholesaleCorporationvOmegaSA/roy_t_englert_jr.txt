mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
repeat
of
quality
king
v.
l'anza
with
only
one
pertinent
difference.
both
cases
involve
goods
not
authorized
for
importation
into
the
united
states.
both
cases
involve
arguments
that
the
first
sale
doctrine
must
be
narrowly
construed,
thus
the
copyright
act's
importation
ban,
section
602(a),
be
given
less
than
its
supposedly
intended
scope.
the
only
difference
is
place
of
manufacture
of
the
goods.
quality
king
involved
u.s.
manufactured
goods;
this
case
involves
goods
made
in
switzerland.
according
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
omega,
congress
intended
to
treat
foreign
manufactured
goods
better
in
this
respect
than
goods
made
in
the
united
states.
it
is
wildly
implausible
that
congress
had
any
such
intent.
from
1790
to
1891,
foreigners
were
categorically
ineligible
to
hold
u.s.
copyrights.
from
1891
to
1986,
the
united
states
discriminated
against
foreign
manufacturing
of
copyrighted
goods
through
a
series
of
so-called
manufacturing
clauses,
including
section
601
of
the
1976
act.
if
congress
intended
to
make
the
first
sale
doctrine
discriminate
in
favor
of
foreign
manufacturing
at
the
same
time,
one
would
expect
some
note
to
be
taken
of
that
fact
in
the
legislative
history,
but
none
is.
and
yet
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
congress
in
1976
altered
the
long-established
first
sale
doctrine
to
make
it
uniquely
favorable
to
foreign
manufacturing
of
copyrighted
goods
and
did
so
through
the
obscure
phrase,
109.
no
one
in
all
the
briefs
in
this
case
has
identified
a
single
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
do
so.
moreover,
the
words
109.
most
instructive
is
the
very
next
section
after
section
109,
section
110,
which
governs
educational
use
of
copyrighted
works
and
was
enacted
contemporaneously
with
109.
in
describing
the
kinds
of
works
teachers
may
show
students
in
their
classroom
without
fear
of
copyright
liability,
congress
referred
to
works
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
our
briefs
have
pointed
out
the
absurdity
of
construing
the
phrase
in
section
110
to
mean
made
in
the
united
states,
and
it's
very
revealing
how
respondent
and
its
amici
have
tried
to
answer
that
point.
omega
says
"lawfully
made
under
this
title"
means
either
made
in
the
united
states
or
authorized
for
distribution
in
the
united
states.
that
argument
gives
up
any
pretense--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--i
hope
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
our--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--if
it
grants
exclusive
foreign
distribution.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
it
matters,
your
honor,
because
of
the
underlying
rationale
of
the
first
sale
doctrine
and
the
underlying
rationale
of
the
import
ban
in
section
602.
the
purpose
of
the
first
sale
doctrine
is
to
make
sure
that
the
copyright
owner
gets
one
and
only
one
recompense
for
each
copy,
for
each
lawfully
made
copy.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
the
reason,
your--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--the
reason
is
to
give
effect
to
the
examples
given
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
602.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
oh.
the
quality
king
has
a
paragraph,
much
discussed
in
the
briefs,
which
cites
to
the
legislative
history
of
section
602
and
in
particular,
cites
to
witness
statements
that
are
in
the
committee
prints
that
are
part
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
602.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
we
don't
draw
a
line
between
those
two,
your
honor.
the
line
is
--
depends
on
whether
the
copyright
owner
has
given
exclusive
foreign
rights
to
someone
else.
and
the
reason
the
exclusivity
of
the
foreign
rights
matters
is
because
that
is
the
example
given
in
the
legislative
history
of
602
and
in
the
paragraph
in
quality
king.
and
to
give
meaning
to
section
602
and
to
be
completely
consistent
with
the
rationale
of
the
first
sale
doctrine,
one
must
draw
some
line.
drawing
a
line
between
the
u.s.
manufacturer
and
the
foreign
manufacturer
makes
no
sense.
it's
not
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
anything.
drawing
a
line
between
the
exclusive
grant
of
rights,
whether
by
license
or
assignment
to
a
foreign
manufacturer
--
or
a
foreign
distributor,
rather,
and
not
granting
such
exclusive
rights
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
rationale--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--well,
your
honor,
since
that's
a
--
a
broader
position
than
ours,
and
we
would--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--well,
the
issue,
your
honor
--
and
you're
putting
me
in
a
position
of
arguing
against
myself
a
little
bit,
but
the
issue
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
602
--
not
the
text,
but
the
legislative
history
--
is
that
congress
did
intend
to
allow
certain
blocking
of
imported
goods
when
there
had
been--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--okay,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
well,
there
is
a
dictum
in
this
court's
opinion
in
quality
king
that
suggests
that
if
a
publisher
and
a
--
an
american
publisher
gives
exclusive
rights
to
a
british
publisher,
if
an
american
author
or
a
british
author
gives
exclusive
territorial
rights
to
two
different
publishers,
then
602
retains
meaning
in
that--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--no,
but
--
with
respect,
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
of
both
the
legislative
history
and
this
court's
dictum
that
they
refer
to
second
and
subsequent
sales.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
no,
that's
not
what
the
example
means.
it
doesn't
say
categorically
all
second
sales
from
british
publishers
are
not
subject
to
the
first
sale
doctrine.
what
it
says
is
in
a
situation
in
which
rights
have
been
divided
and
exclusive
territorial
rights
have
been
given
in
two
different
countries,
or
to
put
it
in
copyright
language,
in
the
language
you
also
used
in
the
legislative
history,
when
the
copyright
owner
has
divided
its
rights
because
an
innovation
of
the
'76
act,
the
copyright
act,
the
copyrights
became
divisible.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
yes,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
the
other
side's
effort
to
read
602
broadly
has
no
support
in
the
text
after
quality
king,
but--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--i
understand.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
you
cannot.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
let
us--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--602(a)(1)
is
limited
to
imports
and
doesn't
confer
a
private
right
of
action.
602(a)(2),
which
was
enacted
after
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
in
this
case,
adds
a
private
right
of
action
and
adds
exports.
but
it
is
--
602(a)(2)
is
a
new
statute.
it
was
not
part
of
the
1976
copyright
act.
so
it
--
it
is
a
subsection
in
which
congress
expanded
on
what
was
already
prohibited
in
602(a)(1).
now,
with
respect
to
text,
the
text
that
the
court
is
construing
is
five
words,
"lawfully
made
under
this
title".
and
those
five
words
are
used
several
places
in
the
copyright
act,
including
section
110,
"for
educational
use".
the
government
says
109
and
section
110,
provisions
of
the
same
chapter
of
the
copyright
act
enacted
contemporaneously.
as
a
fallback
position,
the
government
says
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
having
copyright
liability
for
teachers
who
show
foreign-made
films
in
the
classroom
as
long
as
they
know
they
weren't
made
in
the
united
states.
so,
for
example,
showing
an
ingmar
bergman
film,
the
seventh
seal,
in
class
would
be
copyright
infringement
according
to
the
government.
even
the
people
who
make
movies
don't
agree
with
that
argument.
the
motion
picture
association
of
america
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
and
on
page
19
of
its
brief,
the
mpaa
says
that
the
result
the
government
says
is
a-ok
is,
quote,
"a
nonsensical
and
unintended
consequence".
the
mpaa
goes
on
to
say
there
is
no
evidence
that
such
liability
has
ever
been
imposed,
but
that
argument
misses
the
point.
we
are
trying
to
ascertain
what
congress
meant
by
using
the
phrase
110
remains
a
powerful
argument
that
congress
didn't
use
the
phrase
to
mean
"made
in
the
united
states".
there
is
nothing
extraterritorial
about
construing
u.s.
copyright
act
anywhere
in
the
world.
in
that
respect,
this
case
is
no
different
from
quality
king,
in
which
the
court
rejected
an
extraterritoriality
argument
in
a
two-sentence
footnote.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
yes.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
not
quite,
your
honor.
in
section
602(a)(2)
and
in
section
602(b),
congress
used
the
phrase,
"would
have
constituted
an
infringement
if
this
title
had
been
applicable.
"
and
it
says--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--okay,
sir.
yes,
that
is
the
phrase
congress
used
to
express
a
certain
disfavored
class
of
goods,
goods
that
would
have
been
infringing
if
this
title
would
have
been
applicable.
110
--
109,
excuse
me,
and
110
are
a
different
purpose.
they
are
the
purpose
of
favoring
goods,
goods
that
have
been
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
so,
yes,
congress
could
have
chosen
to
use
a
variation
of
the
phrase
"if
this
title
had
been
applicable.
"
under
109,
but
it
didn't.
and
we
are
left
with
the
language
congress
enacted,
but
it
is
language
that
congress
uses
at
least
four
different
places
in
the
copyright
act,
and
we
have
a
pretty
good
idea
that
it
doesn't
mean
"made
in
the
united
states"
and
it
doesn't
mean
what
omega
says
it
means,
which
is
"made
in
the
united
states
or
authorized
at
any
time
for
distribution
in
the
united
states.
"
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
well,
your
honor,
as
you
know,
there
is
no
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
interaction
between
602(a)
and
109,
and
therefore,
this
court
had
to
address
that
question
for
the
first
time
in
quality
king,
and
the
court
rejected
the
argument
that
109
is
inapplicable
to
imported
goods
altogether.
the
court
did
say
in
a
dictum
which
has
been
discussed
already
this
morning
that
if
a
british
and
an
american
publisher
divide
rights,
then
section
602(a)
does
have
a
role
to
play.
but
the
court
did
not
say
books
manufactured
in
britain
are
not
subject
to
the
first
sale
doctrine.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
correct,
and
the
concurring
opinion
cited
two
distinguished
copyright
treatises
that
suggested
there
was
some
concern
about
extraterritoriality
in
this
case.
well,
even
the
government
has
conceded
there
is
no
concern
about
extraterritoriality
in
this
case,
so
the
rationale
of
those
treatises,
learned
though
they
are,
is
undermined.
if
one
looks
more
closely
at
those
treatises,
they
argue
the
language
is
so
plain
that
it
can
only
be
construed
one
way.
the
government
concedes
that's
not
true.
they
argue
extraterritoriality,
as
i've
already
said,
and
they
argue
that
this
court's
dictum
in
quality
king
--
the
later
additions
to
those
treatises
argue
that
this
court's
dictum
in
quality
king
drew
a
distinction
based
on
place
of
manufacture,
but
it's
only
the
concurring
opinion,
not
the
dictum
in
the
court's
opinion
that
mentions
place
of
manufacture.
so
it's
a
vert
thin
reed
to
say
that
the
case
turned
on
place
of
manufacture.
and
again,
one
can
find
nothing
in
the
quality
king
dictum,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
602,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
109
that
talks
about
place
of
manufacture.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
no.
what
supports
our
position,
your
honor,
is
the
text
of
109,
the
use
of
the
phrase
"lawfully
made
under
this
title",
and
the
use
of
that
phrase
"elsewhere
in
the
copyright
act".
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
that
comes
from
the
legislative
history,
your
honor.
and
for
those
who
prefer
not
to
look
at
legislative
history--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--that
distinction
may
not
hold
up.
but
if
that
distinction
doesn't
hold
up--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--that
strengthens
my
position.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
it
does
not.
the
relevant
legislative
history
is
witness
statements.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
well,
if--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--that
was
not
true
at
the
time.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
pardon
me,
justice
breyer.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
it
was
not
lawful
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
this
statute.
this
court
had
not
yet
decided
gte
sylvania,
and
territorial
restrictions
were
per
se
unlawful
at
the
time
congress
enacted
this
statute.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
i
don't
know
the
state
of
the
law
in
europe.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
but,
again,
what
the
court
has
asked
me
many
questions
about
is
whether
i'm
giving
too
broad
a
scope
to
section
602
and
too
narrow
a
scope
to
section
109.
our
position
is
that
section
109
has
a
necessarily
broad
reach,
and
we
have
tried
to
accommodate
the
legislative
history
and
the
dictum
in
quality
king
to
give
some
role
for
section
602
to
play
in
the
case
of
nonpiratical
goods.
if
the
court
wants
to
reject
anything,
if
it
wants
to
reconsider
the
dictum
in
quality
king
or
not
rely
on
legislative
history,
that
makes
my
position--
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
--and
justice
breyer,
to
be
fair
about
what
the
legislative
history
says,
it
is
statements
by
witnesses.
it
is
not
statements
by
committee,
so
it's
a
little
bit
hard
to
tell
where
they're
drawing
the
line.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
yes.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
justice
breyer,
we
do
know
that
section
602(a)
has
some
role
to
play.
and
when
this
court
was
trying
to
figure
out
in
quality
king
what
role
it
had
to
play
it
did
look
to
the
statements
of
mrs.
harriet
pilpel,
mr.
horace
manges
from
the
american
book
publishers
council.
and
those
are
the
statements
that
the
court
said
in
dicta
presumably
reflected
congressional
intent,
and
so
i
am
relying
on
those
statements
for
the
limitation
of
section
109
to
accommodate
section
602.
but
again,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
me
and
wants
to
give
less
of
a
role
to
602
and
more
of
a
role
to
section
109,
that
is,
of
course,
further
assistance
to
my
position.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roy
t
englert
jr
thank
you,
your
honor.
justice
ginsberg
asked
mr.
panner
what
policy
congress
could
have
had
in
mind
to
give
this
different
status
to
foreign-made
goods
than
to
u.s.
made
goods,
and
mr.
panner's
answer,
and
mr.
stewart
said
something
similar,
was
that
in
one
respect
congress
is
disfavoring
foreign
goods
under
their
interpretation
by
making
them
harder
to
import.
that's
not
true.
under
both
of
their
theories,
as
long
as
the
manufacturer
chooses
to
authorize
importation,
which
is
omega's
test,
or
as
long
as
an
authorized
first
sale
takes
place
in
the
united
states,
then
the
first
sale
doctrine
does
apply.
so
the
copyright
holder
has
control
under
their
theory
and
it's
not
harder
to
import
the
goods.
in
the
briefs
in
this
case
you
will
not
find
anyone
making
any
policy
argument
as
to
what
congress
could
have
had
in
mind
to
favor
foreign-manufactured
goods.
the
heart
of
mr.
panner's
argument
was
that
costco's
position
either
eliminates
any
significant
role
for
section
602(a)(1)
or
makes
section
602(a)(1)
turn
on
formalities
of
transfer
of
title.
neither
of
those
propositions
is
true.
this
court
in
quality
king
addressed
the
role
that
section
602(a)(1)
has
to
play
if
section
109
is
applicable
to
imported
goods,
and
the
answer
was
it
still
applies
to
nonowners.
that
was
the
court's
first
answer.
the
dictum
that
has
been
much
discussed
this
morning
was
another
answer
but
the
court's
first
answer
was
that
it
still
applies
to
nonowners,
and
because,
for
example,
software
is
licensed
there
is
a
very
live
issue
about
whether
the
first
sale
doctrine
applies
to
lawfully
acquired
copies
of
--
of
software.
so
602(a)(1)
has
a
role
to
play
under
anyone's
interpretation.
now
mr.
panner
asserts
that
our
answers
to
some
of
the
questions
that
the
court
has
asked
in
our
efforts
to
harmonize
our
position
with
the
dictum
in
quality
king
make
602(a)(1)
turn
on
formalities
of
transfer
of
title.
our
position
can
perhaps
be
criticized
and
has
been
criticized
this
morning
not
for
having
a
textual
basis,
but
it
cannot
be
criticized
for
making
anything
turn
on
formalities.
our
position
turns
on
the
economic
realities
of
the
situation.
if
the
copyright
owner
gets
its
one
reward,
the
first
sale
doctrine
applies;
if
the
copyright
owner
doesn't
get
its
run
reward,
because
for
example
it
has
given
the
exclusive
foreign
manufacturing
rights
to
someone
else,
and
retained
or
assigned
or
licensed
the
exclusive
u.s.
manufacturing
rights,
then
602(a)(1)
has
a
role
to
play.
so
neither
of
mr.
panner's
criticisms
of
our
position
is
correct.
mr.
panner
asserted
that
section
109(a)
differs
from
section
27,
the
predecessor
statute
in
the
1947
act,
which
in
turn
was
section
41
of
the
1909
act.
this
court
said
the
exact
opposite
in
quality
king.
it
said
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
attempt
to
narrow
the
first
sale
doctrine
through
the
language
of
section
109(a).
and
if
one
looks
at
the
house
report
--
again,
getting
into
legislative
history,
which
some
members
of
the
court
do
not
like
to
get
into
--
but
if
one
looks
at
the
house
report,
the
first
sentence
of
the
relevant
part
of
the
house
report
is
section
109(a)
restates
and
confirms
the
principle
that
where
the
copyright
owner
has
transferred
ownership
of
a
particular
copy
or
phonorecord
of
a
work,
the
person
to
whom
the
copy
or
phonorecord
is
transferred
is
entitled
to
dispose
of
it
by
sale,
rental
or
other
means.
no
hint
that
using
"lawfully
made"
under
this
title
to
narrow
the
doctrine.
the
last
sentence
of
the
relevant
part
of
the
house
report:
to
come
within
the
scope
of
section
109(a)
a
copy
or
phonorecord
must
have
been
lawfully
made
under
this
title
though
not
necessarily
with
the
copyright
owner's
authorization.
for
example,
any
resale
of
an
illegally
pirated
phonorecord
would
be
an
infringement,
but
the
disposition
of
a
phonorecord
legally
made
under
the
compulsory
licensing
provisions
of
section
115,
would
not.
so
what
does
the
house
report
on
section
109
tell
us?
it
tells
us
that
lawfully
made
under
this
title
was
intended
to
expand
the
category
of
covered
works
beyond
just
those
made
by
the
copyright
owner,
or
with
the
authorization
of
the
copyright
owner.
but
under
omega's
and
the
government's
position,
that
phrase
is
used
to
contract
the
scope
of
the
first
sale
doctrine
in
derogation
of
the
common
law,
imposing
a
restraint
on
alienation
for
foreign-made
goods
that
is
not
imposed
on
u.s.
made
goods.
with
respect
to
the
policy
incentives
that
it
creates
it's
undeniable
that
it
creates
an
incentive
for
outsourcing
of
manufacture.
the
government
admitted
that
in
its
cert
stage
brief,
and
again,
in
its
brief
in
this
court.
obviously
if
congress
wants
to
create
an
incentive
for
outsourcing,
that's
probably
within
its
power
as
long
as
it
can
be
said
somehow
to
advance
science
and
the
useful
arts;
but
there
is
simply
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
text
or
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
encourage
outsourcing;
quite
the
contrary.
the
very
controversial
section
601,
the
adjacent
section
to
section
602,
required
that
nondramatic
literary
works
in
the
english
language
be
manufactured
in
the
united
states
or
canada
or
else
they
would
not
be
eligible
for
a
u.s.
copyright.
so
we
know
that
the
1976
congress
wanted
to
favor
the
domestic
printing
industry,
not
to
disfavor
it;
and
yet
their
interpretation
of
602
and
109
would
disfavor
domestic
printing
industry
and
any
domestic
manufacturing
industry.
thank
you.
