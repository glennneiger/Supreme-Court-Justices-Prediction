mr.
englert,
also
talk
about
what,
if
anything,
602(a)(1)
does,
then.
it
seems
602(a)(2)
is
dealing
with
infringing
goods,
with
pirated
goods.
so
given
the
first
sale
doctrine
as
you
construe
it,
what
does
602(a)(1)
protect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
--
i
see
that
602(a)
is
now
broken
into
(1)
and
(2)
and
it's
602(b)
that
you
put
entirely
in
quotes.
but
what
does
602(a)
shelter?
how
does
it
coexist
with
the
first
sale
doctrine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
concurring
opinion
that
says
--
that
said
this
case
is
about
a
round
trip
and
doesn't
talk
to
goods
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
panner,
can
you
answer
mr.
englert's
point
what
earthly
sense
would
it
make
to
prefer
goods
that
are
manufactured
abroad
over
those
manufactured
in
the
united
states?
