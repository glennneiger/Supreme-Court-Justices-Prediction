see,
i'm
with
you,
and
i
think
you
--
the
text
supports
you
up
to
the
point
where
you
add
the
qualification.
but
once
you've
added
that
qualification,
i
think
you're
--
you're
outside
the
text,
just
as
costco
is
outside
the
text
with
the
qualification
that
they
had.

how
often
does
this

justice

--how
often
do
issues
involving

well,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
argument
that
if
"lawfully
made
under
this
title"
means
basically
made
in
the
united
states,
that
provides
a
great
incentive
to
manufacture
goods
abroad
and
that
can't
possibly
be
what
congress
intended?
