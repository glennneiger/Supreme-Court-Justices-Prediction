mr.
aaron
m.
panner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
--
section
602(a)(1)
allows
the
distribution
of
foreign-made
copies
abroad
without
the
u.s.
copyright
holder
forfeiting
the
exclusive
right
to
distribute
copies
domestically,
which
is
guaranteed
by
section
106(3),
and
that
provision
applies
in
this
case.
and
unlike
in
quality
king,
section
109(a)
provides
costco
with
no
defense
because
the
copies
at
issue
were
not
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
that
is,
the
making
of
the
copies
was
not
subject
to
or
governed
by
u.s.
copyright
law.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
be
affirmed
for
three
basic
reasons,
and
the
first
depends
on
the
plain
language
of
section
109(a),
which
applies
only
to
copies
that
were
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
"made"
certainly
includes
the
creation
of
the
physical
copy.
it
also
includes
the
addition
of
any
necessary
intellectual
property
rights
that
would
permit
distribution
in
the
united
states.
so
that
is
to
say
that
we
understand
section
109(a)
should
be
read
to
reach
a
situation
in
which
copy
has
been
subject
to
an
authorized
sale
in
the
united
states.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
let
me
try
to
explain
why.
section
202
of
the
act
draws
a
--
a
distinction
between
the
material
object
and
the
intellectual
property
rights
that
are
involved
in
the
copyright.
and
it
makes
sense.
the
word
106(1).
it's
a
broader
term
that
can
also
refer
to
the
addition
of
these
necessary
intellectual
property
rights.
and
the
--
what
is,
i
think,
important
is
the
decision
whether
the
copy
was
lawfully
made
under
this
title
will,
of
course,
be
made
at
the
time
of
the
sale.
it
is
not
--
the
decision
doesn't
need
to
be
made
at
the
time
of
--
of
manufacture,
because
the
question
is:
how
should
section
109(a)
or
another
provision
apply
to
that
particular
copy?
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
i
think
that
that
probably
gets
us
to
pretty
much
the
same
place,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
the
point
is--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
--
that
also
gives
effect
to
the
language
of
602(a)(1),
because
section
602(a)(1)
is
actually
written
in
a
very
broad
term.
it's
written
to
apply
to
copies
that
have
been
acquired
outside
of
the
united
states.
i
think
--
that
is,
i
think,
an
answer,
justice
breyer,
to
your
objection
that
any
sort
of
sale
ought
to
suffice.
section
602(a)(1)
is
designed
to
permit
a
u.s.
copyright
owner
to
exclude
legitimate
copies,
and
if
you
ask
where
congress
said
that,
it's
right
in
the
house
committee
report,
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
but
the--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--that's
correct.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
and
i
think--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--well,
a
small
qualification,
your
honor.
the
exception
in
section
602(a)(3)
does
allow
libraries
to
lend
copies
that
are
imported
pursuant
to
that
section.
it's
for
archival
or
lending
purposes.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
that
that's
--
i
don't
want
to
get
caught
up
on
the
small
point.
the
more
significant
point
is
that
section
602(a)(1)
is
designed
to
permit
a
u.s.
copyright
owner
--
as
costco
admits,
it's
designed
to
permit
a
u.s.
copyright
owner
to
exclude
legitimate
copies
that
are
made
overseas.
if
the
only
issue
were
one
of
contract,
there
would
be
no
need
for
section
602(a)(1)
because
there
would
be
no
need
to
create
a
copyright
remedy
where
contractual
remedies
are
sufficient;
that
is,
in
circumstances
where
there
is
privity
between
the
u.s.
copyright
owner
or
the
u.s.
copyright
owner's
direct
party
and
the
foreign
copyright
owner.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
your
honor,
section
602(a)(1)
refers
specifically
to
copies
that
have
been
acquired
outside
of
the
united
states.
so
it
does
not
make
sense
to
say
that
it's
limited
to
the
publisher,
because
the
publisher
hasn't
acquired
the
copies.
it
has
produced
the
copies.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
so
i
think
that
the
difficulty
with
costco's
reading,
by
contrast
--
and
i
think
that
some
of
the
court's
questions
brought
that
out
this
morning
--
is
that
either
they
--
costco's
reading
tends
to
eliminate
any
practical
effect
for
section
602(a)(1)
by
making
it
not
apply
to
legitimate
copies
or
it
makes
substantive
rights
turn
on
formalities
of
title,
which
is
quite
inconsistent
with
the
structure
of
the
copyright
act,
which
actually
goes
out
of
its
way
to
make
clear
that
the
nature
of
the
rights
that
are
held
by
the
copyright
owner,
which
is
defined
to
mean
the
owner
of
any
of
the
many
rights
that
comprise
the
copyright,
are
the
same
regardless
of
whether
there's
been
a
transfer.
and
so
when
costco
says,
for
example,
that
omega
would
have
the
right
to
exclude
foreign-made
copies
that
were
produced
by
a
transferee,
but
cannot
do
so
if
it
manufactures
the
copy
abroad
itself,
it
really
draws
a
distinction
that
has
absolutely
no
basis
in
the
text
of
the
copyright
act
and
that
would
make
substantive
rights,
the
value
of
the
rights
under
602(a)(1)
and
106(3),
turn
on
formalities
and,
again,
transfers
that
really
should
make
no
difference
in
terms
of
the
substantive
rights
that
are
available
to
the
copyright
owner.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
your
honor--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--that
is
not
our
position,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
1(e)
of
our
brief,
we
discuss
the
fact
that
an
interpretation
of
109(a)
is
intended
to
reflect
an
exhaustion
principle.
so
where
a
u.s.
copyright
owner
has
exhausted
rights
with
respect
to
a
particular
copy
by
having
been
compensated
for
a
right
that
has
been
invested
into
that
copy,
that
can
be
included
in
the
making.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
again,
there
is
--
because
the
textual
evidence
is
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
reproduction,
which
is
the
narrow
term
used
in
section
106(1),
and
the
broader
term
that
is
used
in
section
109(a),
which
is
"made"
--
and
again,
that
inquiry
is
always
going
to
occur
at
the
time
of
the
challenged
sale
in
the
united
states.
and
so
the
question
is
as
to
that
topic.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
not
at
all,
your
honor,
because
in
quality
king,
what
the
court
held
was
that
a
copy
that
is
made
in
the
united
states
is
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
your
honor,
the
reason--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
what
--
there
was
no
challenge
in
quality
king
to
the
idea
that
the
copy
was
lawfully
made
under
this
title,
precisely
because
the
copy
was
made
in
the
united
states
where
the
copyright
act
governs.
this
court
said
in
our
descani
case
that
the
natural
reading
under
this
title
is
subject
to
or
governed
by
this
title,
and
therefore
it
is
a
perfectly
straightforward
reading
of
the
text.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
but
your
honor,
again,
the
distinction
is
between
the
question
whether
--
what
the
conduct
that
is
being
addressed
is
simply
the
manufacture.
that's
the
case
here.
there's
--
all
that
happened
here
is
that
the
copies
were
manufactured
in
switzerland
and
sold
in
switzerland
for
distribution
abroad.
that
does
not
implicate
u.s.
copyright
law
at
all.
u.s.
copyright
law
provides
the
copyright
owner
with
certain
rights
to
exclude.
it
has
no
right
to
exclude
the
making
of
a
copy,
whatever
you
want
to
say
the
making
means,
in
switzerland.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
determined
that
the
copies
at
issue
here
were
not
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
if
it
were
made,
for
example,
pursuant
to
a
license
that
allowed
for
distribution
in
the
united
states,
there
would
be
an
affirmative
exercise
of
the
exclusive
right
that
the
copyright
holder
has
under
section
106(3)
with
respect
to
that
particular
copy.
and
so
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
say
that
that
copy
is
lawfully
made
under
this
title,
because
you
need
to
look
to
u.s.
law
to
determine
whether
the
making
of
that
copy
--
even
though
it
took
place
overseas,
for
example
--
was
governed
by
--
was
lawful
as
determined
by
the
rights
that
are
granted--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
making
--
the
question
is
whether
it
was
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
if
it
was
made
for
distribution
in
the
united
states,
it
could
only
be
lawfully
made
for
distribution
in
the
united
states
if
the
appropriate
rights
were
granted
by
the
owner
of
those
rights.
and
that
is
why
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
say--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--in
a
particular
case,
it
might
be,
your
honor,
but
in
the
typical
case
--
let's
say
the
heartland
case
--
if
a
manufacturer
has
a
license
under
u.s.
copyright
to
distribute
in
the
united
states,
it
could
be
lawfully
made
at
that
time.
but
i
think,
justice
alito,
you
were
going
to
ask
a
question
about
how
often
the
situation
arises,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
case
that
costco
has
pointed
to,
and
we
are
not
aware
of
them,
where
a
u.s.
copyright
owner
has
sought
to
challenge
the
resale
of
a
copy
where
there
was
an
acknowledged,
authorized
sale
in
the
united
states.
obviously,
this
is
a
significant
issue
to
bringing--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--because
if
the
sale
is
authorized
in
the
united
states,
then
that
copy
would
be
considered
lawfully
made
because
it
includes
the
license.
that
copy
carries
with
it
a
license
to
be
distributed
in
the
united
states,
which
would
include
then
the
right
for
a
lawful
owner
to
resell
it.
again,
that's
consistent
with
the
language
of
602(a)(1),
which
is
clearly
intended
to
allow
the
owner
of
the
u.s.
distribution
right
to
exclude
legitimate
copies
that
were
made
overseas,
and
it
also
sensibly
construes
section
109(a)
to
give
affect
to
the
exhaustion
principle
that
underlies
it.
which
is
where
a
u.s.
copyright
owner
has
exercised
his
u.s.
distribution
rights
with
regard
to
a
particular
copy.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
your
honor,
it
doesn't
create
any
sort
of
a
preference,
as
mr.
englert
--
mr.
englert
suggests
that
this
is
somehow
--
prefers
the
--
the
--
the
copies
that
are
made
abroad.
but
in
the
same
breath,
he
suggests
that
this
will
actually
promote
the
sale
of
u.s.
--
u.s.
manufactured
goods
because
foreign-manufactured
goods
may
therefore
be
of
suspect
legitimacy
for
purposes
of
resale
in
the
united
states.
but
the
key
point
is
that
in
quality
king
this
court
looked
at
the
language
of
section
109(a),
and
it
says
--
and
--
and
--
and
it
emphasized
that
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
first
sale
doctrine
that
text
is
what
matters.
and
it
says
section
109(a)
applies
to
goods
that
are
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
there
was
no
dispute
that
goods
that
are
reproduced
in
the
united
states
are
lawfully
made
under
this
title,
because
one
must
have
a
u.s.
--
the
u.s.
right
in
order
to
lawfully
make
a
copy
in
the
united
states.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
i
think
that
the
--
the
--
the
tracing
of
the
language
is
--
is
helpful,
actually,
to
understand
how
section
--
the
current
section
60
--
excuse
me
current
section
109(a)
differs
from
section
27,
which
is,
in
section
27,
what
happened
was
is
that
congress
codified
in
1909
the
idea
that
the
material
object
is
different
from
the
copyright.
and
when
it
did
that,
it
added
that
language
as
a
tag-on
to
that
principle
to
ensure
that
it
did
not
end
up
overruling
legislatively
bobbs-merrill.
and
when
the
--
when
the
congress
recodified
the
provision
in
1976,
it
actually
took
section
202,
put
it
separately,
and
it
--
it
codified
109(a)
in
a
way
that
is
significantly
different
and
then
it
says
notwithstanding
the
rights
under
106(3)
the
owner
of
a
copy
lawfully
made
under
this
title
is
entitled
to
resell
it.
and
that
needs
to
then
be
read
in
harmony
with
section
602(a)(1),
which
after
all,
was
part
of
the
same
act
in
1976,
it
must
be
read
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
section
rule
602(a)(1)
sufficient
room
to
perform
the
function
that
it
was
intended
to
perform,
which
is
to
ensure
that
a
u.s.
copyright
owner
could
protect
domestic
distribution
rights
against
competition
from
legitimate
foreign
copies.
and
that's
what
it
--
that's
precisely
what's
at
issue
here.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
thank
you,
your
honor,
that's
a
very
good
question.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
coming
up
right
now
through
the
second
circuit
that
involved
textbooks.
this
has
been
--
this
has
been
applied
to
all
sorts
of
traditional
copyrighted
materials,
and
indeed
that's
why
the
amici
who
have
filed
in
this
case
are
not
at
all
limited
but
include
all
of
the
traditional
copyright
industries,
software,
publishing,
movies,
music.
and,
indeed,
costco
does
not
argue
that
there
is
any
legal
significance
to
the
fact
that
--
to
the
nature
of
the
image
or
the
fact
that
it
--
that
it
is
placed
on
a
watch,
because
i
think
that
costco
is
quite
aware
that
what
is
really
at
stake
here
is
whether
section
602(a)(1)
will
continue
to
provide
effective
protection
for
the
exclusive--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
think
so.
and
the
reason
why
is
because,
first
of
all
this
doctrine
has
existed
for
nearly
30
years.
it's
hornbook
law
that
--
that
the
first
sale
doctrine
does
not
provide
a
defense
in
circumstances
where
a
--
a
--
a
copyrighted
article
is
manufactured
or
reproduced
abroad.
that
has
been
well--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--thank
you,
your
honor.
and
i
forgotten
what
it
was.
[laughter]
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
thank
you.
