justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
talking
about
the
first
sale
doctrine.
the
perfectly
consistent
rationale
would
be
whether
there
is
a
first
sale.
so
--
so
109,
though
it
doesn't
say
it,
but
if
you
look
at
the
history
and
title,
there
has
to
be
a
transfer.
so
in
fact,
if
a
british
publisher
with
a
british
right
given
by
an
american
author
or
publisher
makes
this,
109
doesn't
apply
--
i
mean,
109
doesn't
apply
until
there's
a
sale.
now,
that
makes
--
you
--
you
haven't
adopted
that.
nobody
--
i
guess
maybe
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
does,
but
i
don't
see
why
that
isn't
perfectly
sensible
and
i
find
no
authority
against
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
it
is,
but
it
--
the
trouble
with
your
position
is
it
gets
everybody,
i
think,
going
to
be
--
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
all
these
contracts
say.
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
them,
if
not
millions.
what
i
don't
see
is
why
you
don't
just
say:
the
first
sale
doctrine
has
always
meant
there
was
a
transfer
or
sale.
it
meant
that
in
1792,
when
i
took
phil
arita's
antitrust
course,
and
he
used
to
bring
it
up.
you
go
back
to
the
18th
century.
it's
always
meant
there
has
to
be
a
sale
or
transfer.
so
why
don't
we
just
read
109
that
way,
and
there
you
give
meaning
to
everything,
and
there
is
just
no
problem?
now,
i
raise
that
not
because
--
i
raise
it
because
since
there's
only
a
few
people
really
supporting
this,
there
must
be
some
problem
with
what
i
say.
so
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
if
you
say
there
has
to
be
a
first
sale,
there
is
no
problem.
you
block
that
british
manufacturer
from
sending
his
books
to
the
united
states,
but
you
don't
block
the
person
to
whom
he
sells
it.
gives
meaning
to
everything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
no,
i'm
putting
that
to
you,
because
since
you
haven't
advocated
it,
i
must
be
missing
something,
and
i'm
not
an
expert
in
copyright
law.
what
am
i
missing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly,
and
that's
what
it
does
under
my
theory,
because
there
has
been
no
first
sale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
you
mean
you
are
talking
about
jobbers?
somebody
goes
and
buys,
and
so
they're
--
and
so
then
you
lose,
because
if
that's
what
we
are
supposed
to
follow,
those
excerpts
in
the
legislative
history,
then
it
would
mean
that
a
person
who
buys
from
the
british
publisher
cannot
import
into
the
united
states
because
109
doesn't
apply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
to
say,
i
didn't
even
see
it
in
the
legislative
history.
i
didn't
think
they
made
a
big
deal
about
jobbers.
i
like
history
here.
go
back
to
1792.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
do
read
legislative
history,
but
i
didn't
really
find
anything
that
said
that
they
were
worried
about
an
american
and
a
british
publisher
dividing
rights,
and
they
want
them
to
do
that.
there
is
no
problem
with
that,
because
there
has
never
been
a
sale.
so
they
divide
the
rights.
and
there
isn't
even
a
problem
with
--
with
buyers
from
the
british
publisher,
because
a
reasonable
vertically
imposed
territorial
agreement
or
other
restriction
on
resale
is
lawful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it's
reasonable,
they
don't
even
need
copyright.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
isn't
reasonable,
why
should
they
have
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
you
--
yes,
i
just
want
you
to
respond.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here.
but
in
europe,
i
guess,
they
were
lawful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
--
i
think
it's
always
been
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
really
wasn't
to
argue
with
you.
my
question
was:
where
in
the
legislative
history
does
it
say
that
the
point
of
602
is
to
prevent
a
foreign
publisher
from
selling
copies
to
a
distributor
and
then
that
distributor
resells
them
to
the
united
states?
i'm
not
saying
it
doesn't;
it's
just
that
i
didn't
focus
on
those
particular
words
directly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
in
other
words,
somebody
wanted
that.
i
understand
the
industry
wanted
it.
but
--
but
i
--
is
there
anything
in
there
that
suggests
that
this
is
what
congress
wanted
to
do,
members
of
congress?
even
i
draw
the
line
somewhere.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
can.
it
can
exclude
legitimate
copies
before
there's
a
first
sale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
--
the
--
question
is
--
i
mean,
the
text
seems
to
say
602
expands
or
falls
within
106.
all
right?
so
that's
what
it
says.
it
says
--
it
says
it's
an
infringement
of
the
exclusive
right
to
distribute
copies.
that's
the
106
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
109
is
an
exception
from
106.
so
it's
automatically
an
exception
from
602.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
the
text.
and
therefore,
you
are
back
at
what
the
meaning
of
109
is,
if
i
understand
your
argument.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
choice.
if
you
are
going
to
take
109
literally,
then
everything
that
comes
into
the
united
states
can't,
without
the
permission
of
the
copyright
holder,
but
for
the
exception
in
(a)(3),
and
a
library
that
brings
them
in
under
(a)(3)
cannot
even
lend
out
the
books.
that's
one
choice.
and
the
other
choice
is
to
say
that
"lawfully
made"
means
it's
made
without
contravening
any
provision
of
the
act,
if
the
act
were
applicable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
a
third
choice?
maybe
you
want
a
third
choice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
started
with
the
first
sale
doctrine,
because
if
you
apply
the
first
sale
doctrine
as
it
traditionally
has
been
applied
and
if
you
believe
that
109
incorporates
that,
there
is
loads
of
room
for
602(a)(1)
to
act.
that's
all
the
instances
where
the
british
publisher
published
--
makes
the
book.
what
they
do
is
they
have
a
license
and
they
try
to
send
it
to
the
united
states
and
they
can't
without
permission
because
of
602(a)(1),
and
then
109
doesn't
come
into
play
because
there's
been
no
first
sale.
that's
the
part
of
this
case
that
i'm
finding
the
hardest,
because,
literally,
109(a)
--
as
you
correctly
point
out,
109
doesn't
say
that
literally.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
whole
brief
filed
that
traces
the
history
of
that
language,
and
i
think
comes
to
a
somewhat
different
conclusion.
do
you
want
to
say
anything
about
that?
it
was
on
the
other
side.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
other
side,
if
you
go
to
--
you
go
to
--
go
to
home
depot
and
buy
a
desk,
and
how
do
you
know
--
are
you
worried
that
maybe
on
this
desk
it
says
there
was
a
restriction
somewhere,
you
could
only
use
it
for
homes
and
not
for
offices?
does
that
kind
of
thing
worry
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
it
doesn't
is
because
there
is
a
first
sale
doctrine.
now,
aren't
you
importing
those
very
things
that
don't
worry
us
about
home
depot
into
the
entire
world
of
books,
everything
you
are
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
found
the
brief
i
was
looking
for
which
is
the
american
intellectual
property
law
association.
and
they
trace
this
back
to
professor
nimmer's
1965
letter,
and
they
say
that
the
point
there
was
that
they
were
reading
bobbs-merrill
as
it
was
a
pre-emption
question,
that
they
thought
that
the
copyright
law
was
not
pre-empting
state
law
of
contract,
and
state
law
of
contract
had
the
exception
in
it
which
applied
the
first
sale
doctrine.
now
if
that's
the
reasoning,
that
reasoning
would
seem
to
me
to
apply.
we
could
look
up
what
the
state
law
is,
but
my
guess
is
that
the
first
sale
doctrine
applies
just
as
much
to
goods
that
come
from
abroad
as
to
goods
that
are
here
at
home.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
nimmer
said
is,
he
said
we
want
to
be
sure
in
his
--
in
bill
back
in
'64,
'65
--
not
to
invalidate
any
state
law
contractual
restriction
on
the
right
of
the
owner
of
the
particular
copy
to
dispose,
exhibit,
et
cetera
the
same.
