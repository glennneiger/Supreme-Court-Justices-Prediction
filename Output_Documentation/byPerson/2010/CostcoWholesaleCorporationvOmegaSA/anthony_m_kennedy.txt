that

so
that
if
you
lawfully
import
it
into

states,
it
would

apply
at
that

work,

justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
your
example,
if
there
is
a
lawful
importation
of
the
foreign-made
good,
then
if
you
interpret
"made"
as
causing
to
exist
of
appear
or
under
these
laws,
as
the
library
brief
suggests,
the
first
sale
doctrine
would
operate.
