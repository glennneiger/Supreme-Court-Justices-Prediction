mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
government's
interpretation
of
section
109(a)
is
a
little
bit
different
from
either
of
the
parties,
since
i
want
to
make
clear
precisely
what
it
is,
in
our
view,
the
words
17.
and
because
the
copyright
act
doesn't
apply
abroad,
in
order
for
a
copy
to
be
made
subject
to
title
17,
it
would
have
to
be
created
in
the
united
states.
now,
i
think
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
still
gives
it
a
slightly
different
meaning
from
the
alternative
"lawfully
made
in
the
united
states.
"
because
at
least
in
theory,
it
would
be
possible
for
the
creation
of
a
copy
to
entail
a
violation
of
environmental
laws,
workplace
safety
laws,
minimum
wage
laws,
et
cetera.
and
it
wouldn't
be
accurate
to
characterize
a
copy
made
in
that
way
as
lawfully
made
in
the
united
states,
but
it
would
be
made
--
it
would
be
lawfully
made
under
this
title,
because
it
would
be
made
subject
to
and
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
the
copyright
act.
now,
with
respect
to
the
types
of
copyright
materials
at
issue
here,
the
watches
are
clearly
very
different
from
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
section
602(a)(1).
but
in
other
respects,
what
omega
was
trying
to
do
in
this
case
was
exactly
what
congress
intended
to
allow
when
it
expanded
the
importation
provisions
beyond
restrictions
on
importation
of
radical
copies.
the
ideal
was
to
allow
a
copyright
owner
to
segment
markets
either
to
give
--
either
retain
for
itself
or
to
give
to
another
entity
exclusive
rights
within
the
united
states,
but
give
other
rights
abroad
to
other
producers.
and
consequently,
we
argued
in
quality
king
and
we
are
arguing
here
that
the
court
should
construe
section
109(a)
in
a
way
that
doesn't
prevent
section
602(a)
from
performing
that
function.
and
the
court
in
quality
king
grappled
with
the
question
of
whether
applying
the
--
section
109(a)
to
the
labels
that
were
at
issue
in
that
case
would
have
the
effect
of
negating
602(a)(1)
and
the
court
said
no
it
wouldn't,
because
section
109(a)
applies
only
to
copies
that
are
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
and
the
court
specially
said
it
wouldn't
apply
to
copies
that
were
made
--
lawfully
made
under
the
law
of
the
foreign
country.
now,
the
court
didn't
refer
specifically
to
the
place
of
manufacture.
in
giving
the
example
of
the
british
publisher
who
would
be
creating
copies
under
the
law
of
great
britain,
it
didn't
specifically
say
that's
because
british
law
would
apply
when
the
copies
are
made
in
england.
but
i
think
that's
the
necessary
inference,
because
the
court's
analysis
made
quite
clear
that
it
viewed
a
particular
copy
as
being
lawfully
made
under
the
law
of
one
and
only
one
question--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
there
are
--
i
think
we
would
say
a
couple
of
things.
the
question
has
been
raised
whether
this
gives
favored
status
to
a
foreign
manufactured
goods.
and
in
one
sense
our
reading
--
from
--
from
the
perspective
of
the
copyright
owner,
it's
true,
that
this
creates
something
of
potential
incentive
to
manufacture
abroad.
now,
from
the
perspective
of
the
potential
importer,
you
could
say
this
makes
foreign
manufactured
goods
disfavored
because
they
were
harder
to
get
into
the
country
than
would
be
the
case
if
they
had
been
manufactured
within
the
united
states
and
had
then
been
sent
abroad
and
--
and
reimported.
i
guess
the
best
we
can
say
about
the
treatment
from
the
copyright
owners'
prospective,
the
differential
treatment
of
foreign
and
domestic
manufactured
goods
is
that
at
least
with
respect
to
goods
that
were
made
within
the
united
states,
the
copyright
owner
has
exercised
rights
under
united
states
law.
he
has
--
it
has
exercised
its
exclusive
right
to
produce
the
copies
in
the
first
instance,
whereas
the
manufacturer
in
omega's
position
by
creating
and
then
selling
the
watches
abroad,
never
exercised
any
of
its
title
17
rights.
and
the
theory
underlying
the
first
sale
doctrine
tracing
it
back
to
--
to
bobbs-merrill,
the
first
articulation
by
this
court
of
the
--
the
doctrine
of
the
copyright
context,
the
theory
is
that
a
copyright
owner
who
sells
the
goods,
places
them
in
the
stream
of
commerce,
has
exercised,
as
the
court
put
it
in
bobbs-merrill,
its
exclusive
right
to
vend,
and
therefore
it
can
claim
no
more
rights
under
the
copyright
laws.
omega
with
respect
to
the
watches
at
issue
here,
never
exercised
any
its
rights
under
title
17,
not
--
not
when
the
watches
were
made
and
not
when
they
were
sold.
i
do
also
want
to
address
the
question
of
what
happens
in
the
circumstance
where
omega
manufactures
watches
abroad,
but
then
voluntarily
imports
them
into
the
united
states,
sells
them
here;
can
it
place
restrictions
on
resale
because
i
think
it's
an
important
policy
question
and
here
again
we
get
to
the
same
point
in
the
end
as
the
respondents
do,
but
we
have
a
somewhat
different
textual
route
to
get
there.
our
view
is
that
in
that
circumstance
section
109(a)
still
would
not
apply,
because
even
though
the
goods
were
imported
into
the
united
states,
they
were
made
abroad,
and
that's
what
counts
for
determining
whether
they
were
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
but
section
109(a)
is
simply
a
safe
harbor.
it
doesn't
prohibit
anything.
section
109(a)
says
if
your
conduct
falls
within
these
contours
then
what
you
are
doing
is
legal,
whether
or
not
it
would
otherwise
violate
the
copyright
act.
but
if
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
section
109(a)
applies,
and
a
court
held
that
it
doesn't,
the
consequence
is
not
necessarily
that
the
conduct
is
unlawful.
the
consequence
is
that
you
look
to
other
provisions
of
title
17
to
see
whether
it
is
lawful
or
not.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
we
would
say
the
first
sale
doctrine
as
articulated
in
bobbs-merrill
would
operate,
but
we
wouldn't
place
this
within
section
109(a).
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
we
would
still
be
looking
to
other
provisions
of
the
copyright
act
rather
than
to
common
law.
that
is,
in
the
hypothetical
i
describe,
clearly
there
could
be
no
violation
of
602(a)(1),
because
the
copies
would
have
been
imported
by
omega
itself.
and
so
the
question
is
if
omega
sells
them
within
the
united
states
and
the
buyer
attempts
to
resell
them,
would
that
be
an
infringement
of
omega
17's
rights?
and
the
only
claim
that
omega
could
--
i
mean
that
--
omega
could
plausibly
make
in
that
circumstance
would
be
to
say,
that
is
a
violation
of
my
exclusive
right
to
distribute
copies
to
the
public
protected
by
section
106(3).
and
i
think
the
response
would
be
under
bobbs-merrill,
the
court
already
held
that
once
the
copyright
owner
exercised
its
exclusive
right
to
vend
--
the
word
which
appeared
at
the
statute
at
the
time
--
once
it
had
exercised
its
exclusive
right
to
vend
the
copies,
it
was
done
with
them
and
had
no
more
rights
to
assert.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
give
the
right
to
vend
--
the
right
to
distribute
under
the
current
law
a
broader
reading
than
the
right
to
vend
had
at
that
time,
simply
because
congress
has
enacted
section
109.
and
--
so
i
think
that
the
--
it
would
still
be
the
case
that
in
order
to
prevail
in
a
copyright
suit,
omega
would
have
to
show
that
not
only
that
section
109
was
inapplicable,
but
there
was
a
violation
of
the
exclusive
rights
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
able
to
do
that
here.
now
in
bobbs-merrill,
the
court
was
certainly
drawing
on
common
law
principles
but
it
said
in
the
end,
its
words:
"this
is
exclusively
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
"
it
--
it
based
its
holding
on
the
language
of
the
copyright
act
as
it
existed
at
that
time,
specifically
the
exclusive
right
to
vend;
and
the
exclusive
right
to
distribute
copies
to
the
public
is
no
different
for
these
purposes
under
the
current
statute.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
--
i
think
with
--
with
respect
to
the
pre-emption
question,
what
they
had
in
mind
was
a
situation
in
which
omega
sells
the
watch
to
a
reseller
--
to
a
retailer
on
condition,
for
instance,
that
the
retailer
only
sell
them
in
a
particular
way,
or
do
particular
types
of
advertising,
and
the
reseller
sells
them
in
violation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
exactly.
i
think
the
language
was
chosen
in
part
at
least
to
make
clear
that
although
omega
under
in
that
hypothetical
circumstance
would
have
no
remedy
under
the
copyright
act,
it
might
potentially
have
a
breach
of
contract
suit
against
the
retailer
if
the
retailer
had
breached
the
agreement
with
omega,
and
that
nothing
was
--
in
the
federal
law
was
intended
to
preempt
the
state
law
contractual
remedies
that
would
otherwise
be
available.
and
i
think
the
language
adequately
accomplishes
that
purpose.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
sorry?
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
in
1960
--
may
i?
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
because
many
of
the
people
with
which
congress
were
concerned
would
not
be
in
privity
of
contract
with
the
u.s.
copyright
owner.
