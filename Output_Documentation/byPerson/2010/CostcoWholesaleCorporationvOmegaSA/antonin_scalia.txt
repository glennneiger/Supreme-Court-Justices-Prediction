justice

scalia
where
do
you
get
that
in
the
text?
i
mean,
that's
lovely,
and
you're
saying
that
what
justice
breyer
suggests
makes
perfect
sense
except
for
dictum
and
legislative
history.
does
your
position
make
any
sense
with
regard
to
text?
justice
antonin
scalia
where?
where
is
that
limitation
in
the
text?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
limitation
on
exclusive
rights
abroad
versus
nonexclusive
rights
abroad.
where
can
you
possibly
find
that
in
the
text?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
well,
that's
the
end
of
it
for
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
really
mean
--
your
position
is
that
"lawfully
made
under
this
title"
means
that
--
means
"would
have
been
lawfully
made
under
this
title
if
this
title
governed.
"
isn't
that
basically
what
you
are
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
but
there
is
another
provision
of
the
statute
--
i
forget
where
it
is
--
which
says
that
in
so
many
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
"if
this
title
had
been
applicable.
"
right?
we
say
"applicable".
much
prettier.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
nothing
in
the
text
that
supports
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
pulled
out
of
the
sky
this
distinction
between
having
created
exclusive
rights
abroad
and
having
created
nonexclusive
rights
abroad.
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
use--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
know
why
using--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
the
legislative
history
suggest
what
part
of
the
text
this
--
this
novel
suggestion
was
based
upon?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
write
that
down.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
--
why
didn't
they
say
--
instead
of
"lawfully
made
under
this
title",
why
didn't
they
just
say
"made
in
the
united
states"?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
what
you
say
it
means.
"made
under
this
title"
means
"made
in
the
united
states".
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
just
not
in
the
text.
i
mean,
like
the
other
side,
in
order
to
make
your
theory
of
the
text
appear
reasonable,
you
have
to
bring
in
a
skyhook
with
a
limitation
that
finds
no
basis
in
the
text.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
say
that.
i
mean,
you
bring
in
this
other
qualification.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
would
be
lawfully
made
under
this
title,
even
though
it
was
made
--
you
know,
made
abroad,
if
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
isn't
the
making
that
is
rendered
lawful.
it's
the
importation
into
the
united
states
that
is
rendered
lawful
by
the
agreement
that
you
are
relying
upon.
