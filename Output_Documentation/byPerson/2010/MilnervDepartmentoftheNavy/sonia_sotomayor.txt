but
there
was
a
proposal
to
amend
2--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
it
was
a
conscious
decision
by
congress
not
to
do
2
to
conform
to
crooker
more
generally,
but
to
only
pass
7.
so
there
has
to
be
a
meaning
to
the
decision
to
limit
the
amendment.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
in
rose
we
talked
about
a
legitimate
public
purpose
in
seeking
information.
i
tie
my
question
to
justice
alito's,
which
is
at
what
point
does
--
is
it
legitimate
for
the
public
to
seek
information,
internal
information
relating
to
the
rules
and
practices
of
personnel?
can
the
public
seek
information
that
places
the
community
at
a
severe
security
risk?
is
it
possible
for
us
to
say
that
that
kind
of
information,
given
our
line
of
reasoning
in
rose,
could
not
be
legitimate
public
information?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
what
the
textual
basing
for
crooker's
"predominantly
internal"
and
"circumvention
of
agency
regulation"
requirements
is?
where
in
the
text
are
those
words
and
how
do
you
create
them
except
through
sort
of
judicial
crafting?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
problem
with
that
in
this
case
is
that
it's
a
mixed
document.
it
is
predominantly
for
internal
use,
but
not
exclusively.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
you
square
that
with
the
words
"related
solely
to
internal"?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
the
case
summaries
there
were
internal
solely.
they
were
created
only
for
purposes
of
the
agency's
honor
code
review
or
discipline
review.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
yet
we
ordered
it
disclosed.
we
created
an
exception
to
the
plain
language
of
the
rule,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
oh,
i
agree.
but
i
think
the
distinction
it
made
was
that
it's
only
internal
rules
and
practices
of
the
agency,
personnel
agency,
if
the
public
has
no
legitimate
interest
in
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
begs,
i
think
justice
scalia's
question.
one
could
argue
that
everything
that
the
agency
develops
except
rules
telling
the
public
how
to
come
to
the
agency
with
a
complaint,
et
cetera
--
virtually
everything
will
govern
either
the
internal
personnel
practices
or
the
agency's
practices
vis-a-vis
the
public.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
basically
anything
that
the
agency
uses
to
craft
its
internal
employee
practices
and
rules
gets
swept
up
as
private,
as
internal?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
--
if--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
you
are
taking
out
the
records
related
to
personnel
and
not
making
it
a
condition
of
the
disclosure.
you
are
saying
if
any
document
circumvents
the
agency's
functioning,
that
is
exempted.
you
are
not
tying
--
that's
where
i'm--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
do
the
documents
that
the
agency
reviews
to
determine
and
craft
its
internal
rules
and
practices
fall
under
the
rubric
of
being
related
to,
solely
related
to,
personnel
practices
and
rules?
if
they
were
created
separately,
if
they
were
created
for
multiple
purposes,
if
they
were
used
in
different
circumstances
besides
the
relationship
of
employees
to
others--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
map
doesn't.
you
use
the
map
to
do
the
latter
things.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
see
--
i'm
sorry.
i'm
cutting
you
off
because
your
light
is
on.
do
you
see
any
difference
between
the
position
you
are
taking
and
crooker?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
formulate
your
test
very
differently
than
crooker
does.
what
are
those
differences?
