justice
elena
kagan
so
can
we
talk
about
that
reading,
mr.
yang?
let's
talk
about
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
key
word,
key
term,
is
"personnel
rules
and
practices".
if
i
said
to
you,
what's
a
personnel
file,
what
would
you
say?
justice
elena
kagan
it
could
be
referring
to
exemption
6
or
it
could
be
referring
to
just
generally
in
a
conversation.
your
personnel
file,
what
does
it
mean?
justice
elena
kagan
can
you
think
of
another
context
in
which
it
means
something
other
than
that?
justice
elena
kagan
it's
a
kind
of
h.r.
file,
right?
justice
elena
kagan
so
why
should
there
be
any
difference
if
you
look
at
the
term
h.r.
files
and
practices.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
yang,
if
--
if
we
assume
that
a
majority
of
this
court
finds
this
statutory
interpretation
untenable
and
that
you
lose,
but
that
the
court
is
also
concerned
about
the
government's
reliance
interests
here,
and
about
this
set
of
documents
that
have
been
exempted
under
exemption
2
that
would
become
unexempt,
is
there
anything
that
the
court
can
do
about
that?
is
there
anything
that
the
government
would
need
to
--
to
advance
--
to
deal
with
those
reliance
interests?
justice
elena
kagan
i
am
assuming,
yes.
that's
just
an
assumption.
justice
elena
kagan
the
freedom
of
information
act,
better
known
as
foia
generally
requires
the
federal
government
to
make
its
records
available
to
the
public
on
request.
but
foia
contains
nine
exemptions,
nine
categories
of
material
that
the
government
does
not
have
to
disclose.
in
this
case,
concerns
the
meaning
of
one
of
those
exemptions,
exemption
2.
according
to
that
exemption,
the
government
need
not
disclose
records
that
relates
solely
and
i'm
quoting
now,
"that
relate
to
the
internal
personnel
rules
and
practices
of
an
agency".
now
this
case
started
when
the
navy
received
a
foia
request
for
something
called
explosive
safety
quantity
distance
information
for
a
naval
base
in
puget
sound,
washington.
that's
a
$10
term
but
what
it
means
is
this,
the
navy
stores
explosive
at
the
space
and
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
facility
is
as
safe
as
possible,
navy
personnel
use
various
data
and
maps
to
show
the
effect
of
an
explosive
device
going
off.
that
information
enables
them
to
store
the
explosives
so
that
even
if
one
does
go
off,
it
won't
set
off
a
chain
reaction.
and
the
foia
request
here
was
for
those
explosive
maps
and
data.
the
navy
denied
the
request
based
on
exemption
2.
the
ninth
circuit
upheld
the
navy's
action,
but
we
reversed.
the
navy
maybe
able
to
withhold
these
explosives
maps
under
some
other
exemption,
but
it
cannot
do
so
by
relying
on
exemption
2.
the
text
of
exemption
2
compels
these
results,
records
relating
the
personnel
rules
and
practices,
and
that's
the
key
phrase,
are
records
that
concerned
employee
relations
and
human
resources
matters.
this
is
just
a
matter
of
ordinary
language,
the
meaning
of
the
word
"personnel"
as
used
in
the
exemption
to
modify
rules
and
practices.
all
of
us
can
think
of
similar
uses
of
the
term
personnel.
a
personnel
department
deals
with
employee
relations
and
problems.
a
personnel
agency
helps
place
people
in
jobs.
and
the
personnel
file
which
is
a
term
foia
also
uses
in
another
exemption
is
the
file
containing
information
about
an
employee's
work
history.
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
word
"personnel"
is
a
synonym
for
hr
or
human
resources.
congress
meant
the
same
thing
here.
personnel
rules
and
practices
are
rules
and
practices
relating
to
the
conditions
of
employment
in
federal
agencies,
hiring
and
firing,
work
rules
and
discipline,
compensation
and
benefits.
so
for
example,
if
an
agency
record
has
to
do
with
employee
pay
or
parking
or
vacations,
it
falls
within
the
exemption.
but
almost
needless
to
say
a
record
about
the
effects
of
detonating
an
explosive
device
does
not.
and
so
the
navy
cannot
withhold
these
records
under
exemption
2.
the
ninth
circuit
held
otherwise
in
reliance
on
an
old
dc
circuit
decision
that
adopted
a
much
broader
interpretation
of
exemption
2.
under
that
decision,
the
government
could
also
withhold
any
internal
materials
whose
release
would
risk
circumvention
of
law.
today,
we
reject
that
interpretation
as
inconsistent
with
exemption
2's
text
and
its
purpose.
we
recognized
that
the
government
may
have
good
reasons
to
protect
these
explosives
maps
and
other
similar
materials
and
we
do
not
say
today
that
the
navy
must
release
these
records.
other
foia
exemptions
may
shield
them.
the
navy
argued
below
that
exemption
7
which
protects
certain
law
enforcement
records
applies
to
the
explosive
data
and
that
argument
remains
open
to
the
government
on
remand.
in
addition,
exemption
1
prevents
access
to
classified
documents.
that
exemption
ensures
that
the
government
can
withhold
documents
whose
disclosure
would
compromise
national
security.
we
hold
today
just
one
thing
that
the
government
cannot
withhold
these
records
on
the
basis
of
an
exemption
that
covers
and
was
meant
to
cover
only
employee
relations
matters.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
