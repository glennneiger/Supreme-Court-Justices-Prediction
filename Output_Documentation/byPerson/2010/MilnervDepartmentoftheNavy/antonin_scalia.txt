justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
get
a
different
congress.
i
mean,
the
congress
that
passed
the
law
is
not
necessarily
the
same
congress
that
failed
to
amend
the
law.
are
we
to
consider
laws
to
be
in
effect
only
for
so
long
as
the
congress
that
passed
them
is
sitting,
and
then
the
failure
to
make
any
changes
in
light
of
judicial
decisions
by
later
congresses
effectively
amends
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
an
extraordinary
proposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mann,
do
you
assume
there
is
always
a
reason
for
congress's
not
passing
a
law?
i
mean,
it's
hard
enough
to
figure
out
their
reason
for
passing
a
law,
but
there
could
be
an
infinitude
of
reasons
why
a
law
is
not
passed.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
failure
of
congress
to
amend
a
law
in
order
to
overrule
a
court
decision
other
than
a
decision
of
this
court
has
been
held
to
be
an
implicit
approval
of
that
decision?
do
we
have
a
single
case
where
we
said,
oh,
there
was
a
line
of
court
of
appeals
cases
and
since
congress
failed
to
amend
the
statute
to
take
account
of
those
court
of
appeals
cases,
congress
must
have
approved
them.
do
we
have
any
case
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
of
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mann,
i
thought
you
disagreed
with
the
premise
of
justice
ginsburg's
question;
that
is,
that
you
assert
that
the
language
related
solely
to
the
internal
personnel
rules
and
practices
of
an
agency
is
quite
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
maybe
you
were
abandoning
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
rules
of
an
agency
would
--
would
--
would
be
sucked
in,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
rules
the
agency
promulgates
are
supposed
to
be
enforced
by
the
personnel
of
the
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
become
personnel
rules
and
practices.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
the
office
of
personnel
management
has
a
pretty
broad
charter,
then,
on
your
theory
of
what
the
adjective
means.
opm
must
be
a
very
powerful
agency.
[laughter]
