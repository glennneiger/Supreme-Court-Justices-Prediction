mr.
anthony
a.
yang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
has
asked
this
court
to
disrupt
30
years
of
foia
practice
by
rejecting
an
interpretation
of
exemption
2
that
has
prevailed
and
has
provided
a
workable
standard
for
agencies
and
the
courts
since
the
d.c.
circuit's
en
banc
decision
in
crooker.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
i
think
the
--
as
our
brief
explained,
there
are
three
basic
elements
to
exemption
2.
the
first
is
the
internal
element,
and
we
believe
that
means
that
the
records
at
issue
must
be
properly
maintained
within
an
agency
and
not
for
general
release.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
i
think--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--right.
if
i
could
just
finish
the
internality
and
then
talk
about
how
it
relates
solely,
how
it
relates
to,
i
think
that
would
be
probably
easiest.
internal
and
when
a
document
is
properly
held
within
an
agency
as
internal
reflects
the
foia
balance
that's
at
issue
throughout
the
exemption.
it
involves
the
balance
between
the
public
interest
in
knowing
information
about
the
government
and
the
need
for
the
government
to
maintain
certain
things
in
confidence.
and
in
this
context
rose
addressed
two
other
contexts.
rose
explained
that
when
there
is
no
legitimate
public
interest,
things
may
be
properly
internal.
there
is
simply
no
reason
to
disclose
it.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
if
it
was--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
i
don't
believe
this
court
created
an
exception
to
the
statute.
i
think
what
the
court
did
was
construe
the
statute
and,
although
it's
not
clear
from
the
text
of
rose
exactly
the
textual
foundation
for
that
decision,
i
think
it
is
best
read
as
turning
on
the
internality.
and
understanding
what
is
properly
internal
under
exemption
2
must
be
understood
in
light
of
what
foia
is
doing
and
what
the
legislative
history
suggests
for
the
exemption.
and
so
what
we--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
think
it
said
that
that's
the
case
where
there
is
no
countervailing
interest
on
the
other
side.
at
least
where
there
is
no
risk
of
circumvention,
is
what
the
court
was
saying.
what
we
have
here
is
a
different
foia
balance.
what
we
have
here
is
something
strong
on
the
government
interest
side.
there
are
certain
things
that
just
cannot
be
disclosed
to
the
public
and
have
the
government
function
well.
this
is
one
of
these.
this
would
be
the
location,
type,
amount
of
munitions
stored
on
a
naval
facility.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
there
is
--
for
instance,
the
appendix
includes
a
map
of
buildings.
it
doesn't
explain
where
munitions
are
stored.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
maybe
not
in
every
building.
what
you
know
is
there
are
buildings
and
there
are
sites,
but
you
don't
know
which
ones,
how
much,
the
types
of
munitions.
and
what
we
are
talking
about
is
more
than
a
map.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
more
generally
the
esqd
information
in
the
records,
which
includes--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--there
appears
to
have
been
a
release,
and
the
record
does
not
provide
us
detail
as
to
why,
before
9/11
by
the
bangor
facility
of
some
arcs.
now,
it's
important
to
know
that
arc
maps
have
different
levels
of
importance.
for
instance,
you
might
have
an
arc
map
around
a
bomb
squad
on
a
base,
because
bomb
squads
need
to
maintain
a
small
amount
of
munitions,
but
that
arc
isn't
particularly
sensitive.
so
arc
maps
might
be
released
in
certain
contexts,
and
the
navy
here
actually
does
conduct
a
case-by-case
balancing
to
see
whether
or
not
it
would
be
appropriate
to
release
this
information.
here
what
we
do
know
is
that
the
navy
looked
at
the
arc
maps
here,
which
are
highly
sensitive
maps,
as
well
as
the
associated
esqd
information,
and
determined
that
releasing
this
information
would
provide
a
road
map
to
those
with
bad
intent
to
circumvent
the
very
safety
procedures
that--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--our
brief
briefly
addresses
this.
i
believe
it's
footnotes
on
page
--
footnote
5
on
page
8.
and
what
we
can
say
from
the
record
is
that
the
navy
looked
at
the
material
here,
explained
that
bangor
is
a
single
weapons
facility,
involves
a
much
more
simplistic
storage
and
safety
security
problem
than
the
naval
magazine
indian
island.
and
also,
i
would--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
it's
difficult
to
classify
when
you
need
to
share
in
limited
circumstances
with
local
responders.
the
navy
here
has
shared--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--when
you
classify
a
document,
it
restricts
access
to
people
with
a
federal
need
to
know,
people
who
have
been
adjudicated
as
eligible
to
receive
classification,
received
the
proper
training.
the
navy
in
this
instance
needs
to
share
limited
arc
information
with
the
local
fire
department
and
the
police
department
to
make
plans
for
in
the
event
of
an
emergency.
and
that
was
shared
in
confidence
with
these
local
force
responders
and
was
unfortunately
disclosed
without
our
authorization.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
that
is
true
in
certain
circumstances,
but
there
are
other--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
if
the
court
were
to
provide
us
with
the
opportunity,
i
think
the
navy
could
consider
that--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--the
relevant
executive
order
that
governs
classification
does
allow
classification
of
materials
which
have
been
disseminated
beyond
the
government.
but
there
are
certain
thresholds
that
have
to
be
met.
i
am
not
an
original
classifying
authority,
so
i
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
say
whether
these
types
of
things
could
be
classified
in
this
instance.
it
is
at
least
theoretically
possible.
but
what
i
want
to
underscore
is
that
the
reason
that
these
materials
are
not
classified
in
this
instance
is
because
it
is
important
to
share
with
the
local
fire
department.
now,
the
local
fire
department--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--it
is
--
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
only
federal
government
employees
can
have
classification.
you
can
--
you
have
contractors.
there
are
instances
where
you
can
classify
material
and
share
it
with
nonfederal
entities
which
have
been
given
appropriate
clearances.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
don't
believe
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
torture
the
language
of
foia.
we
think
that
we
have
a
fair
reading,
by
no
means
an
unambiguous
reading
of
the
statute,
but
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute,
and
it
is
a
reading
that
has
prevailed
for
almost
30
years
now.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
it
depends
on
context.
you
may
be
referring
to
exemption
6.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
in
the
context
of
exemption
6
i
think
it
refers
to
files
pertaining
to
personnel.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
think
the
term,
the
phrase
"personnel
file"
itself
is
normally
referred
--
normally
used
to
refer
to
personnel.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
that's
generally
true.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
it's
certainly
one
reading.
we
think
that
personnel
rules
and
practices
of
an
agency
can
fairly
encompass
instructions
that
you
provide
the
personnel.
for
instance,
if
you
were
to
instruct
the
personnel
that
they
are
to
appear
at
work
at
9
and
leave
at
5
or
they
are
to
perform
a
certain
number
of
duties,
ten
cases
per
day,
or
you
need
to
process
these
cases
in
a
certain
manner
--
all
of
those
i
think
would
be
fairly
characterized
as
personnel
rules
and
practices
of
an
agency.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
no,
i
think--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
think
so--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--the
focus
on
personnel
in
the
statute
helps
to
distinguish
between
rules
and
practices
which
govern
personnel,
and
rules
and
practices
which
also
are
there
to
govern
the
public
in
its
interactions
with
the
agency.
and
this
goes
back
to
the
question
that
we
initially
started
on.
"relates
solely"
when
you
are
related
solely
to
the
internal
personnel
rules
and
practices
of
the
agency,
it
--
it
extends
just
beyond
just
the
rules
and
practices
of
themselves,
but
it
makes
sure
that
the
focus
solely
is
still
on
personnel.
so
there
are
things
--
for
instance,
if
the
rule
is
that
you
need
to
file
a
foia
request
in
a
certain
way,
and
the
agency
instructs
personnel
to
process
it
in
a
certain
way,
those
rules
also
would
affect
the
public.
the
public
would
need
to
comply.
if
there
is
a
dual
purpose,
a
dual
function
of
the
rule
or
practice,
it
would
not
relate
solely
to
the
internal
personnel
rules.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
but
not
everything
that
the
agency
does
will
relate
solely
or
exclusively
to
govern
the
internal
personnel
--
the
rules
and
practices
for
personnel.
when
there
is
a
dual
function,
that
is
it
both
instructs
personnel
how
to
do
their
duties
and
it's
also
something
that
the
public
must
take
into
account--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
i
--
i
don't
know
that
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
think
the
personnel
rules
and
practices
that
are
at
issue
here
are
a
complex
set
of
rules
that
are
based
on
types
of
munitions,
the--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--because
it
is
a
rule
that
pertains
to
personnel.
it
is
a
rule
that
governs
the
personnel's
discharge
of
their
duties.
and
if
the--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--that
is
true.
humans
--
and
we
still
do,
thank
goodness,
do
things.
but
the
focus
of
the
exemption
in
context
--
the
exemption
applies
to
matters
that
relate
solely
to
the
internal
personnel
rules
and
practices
of
an
agency.
personnel
helps
to
focus
the
inquiry
on
the
rules,
and
again
only
relating
solely,
on
rules
that
govern
agency
personnel,
as
opposed
to
rules
that
might
govern
those
personnel
and
govern
the
public's
interaction
with
the
agency.
that's
the--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
i
--
it
certainly
is.
[laughter]
but
i
think
what
we
are
saying
is
that
personnel
can
have
different
meanings
in
different
contexts.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
there
were
--
i
can
give
you
a
few
examples
from
the
legislative
history,
for
instance.
one
of
the
problems
that
congress
was
concerned
with
is
that
the
old
exemption,
exemption
in
section
3,
had
been
construed
to
apply
to
internal
management,
including
things
such
as
phone
books,
agency
phone
books
for
personnel.
that
would
no
longer
be
encompassed.
things
like
budgets
that
the
agency
produces,
that
arguably
would
be
internal
management,
that
would
not
be
under
the
internal
personnel
rules
and
practices
of
the
agency.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
when
congress
drafted
this
statute,
it
initially
started
with
internal
personnel
--
or
excuse
me,
internal
employment
rules
and
practices
and
changed
that
to
personnel.
in
the
report
that
effectuated
that
change,
the
explanation
and
the
only
explanation
was
that
that
change
was
similar
--
made
the
exemption
similar
but
more
tightly
drawn
than
the
apa's
management
exemption,
which
at
the
time
existed
in
another
part
of
the
statute;
there
was
a
cross-reference.
when
congress
then
continued
to
revise
the
statute,
the
house
made
very
clear
in
the
hearings,
in
the
house
report
and
on
the
floor
that
its
intent
was
to
cover
these
types
of
rules
and
manuals
and
instructions
to
agency
personnel
when
doing
so
would
risk
the
functions
that
are
at
issue
here.
and
when
congress
in
1986
amended
foia
by
adding
--
or
amending
exemption
7
e,
it
ratified
the
existing
rule.
and
it
did
so
because
--
it
ratified
it
and
it
had
to
--
it
extended
it
in
two
important
ways.
crooker
left
open
the
question
or
at
least
made
it
vague
as
to
whether
prosecution
guidelines
would
be
protected
by
exemption
2.
the
reason
that
was
unclear
is
because
the
d.c.
circuit
had
previously
concluded
in
jordan
that
exemption
2
did
not
apply.
crooker
rejected
all
of
jordan
's
rationale
but
the
someone
enigmatically
said,
but
we
would
reach
the
same
result.
justice
ginsburg's
concurrence
explained
in
crooker
that
this
muddied
the
waters,
and
when
congress
revisited
foia
and
exemption
7(e),
it
specifically
provided
an
exemption
for
law
enforcement
investigations
and
prosecutions.
in
doing
so
it
made
clear
that
whatever
existed
of
jordan
was
gone.
it
also
did
something
else--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
they
amended
exemption
7--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--to
adopt
crooker
in
certain
areas.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
no,
i
think
what
it
did
is
it
took
crooker
as
understood,
but
what
it
did
with
respect
to
law
enforcement
records
--
and
remember
it's
only
records
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes
that
would
disclose
techniques,
procedures
or
guidelines
for
investigations
or
prosecutions.
in
that
context,
congress
lowered
the
bar.
it
provided
more
protection
for
those
law
enforcement
records
than
crooker
did.
this
is
part
of
what
congress
was
doing
in
exemption
7
more
generally,
and
this
court's
decision
in
reporters
committee
discusses
this.
before
'86
exemption
7
applied
where
disclosure
would
cause
a
bunch
of
these
harms,
these
enumerated
harms.
congress
changed
7
to
7(e)
where
--
with
respect
to
the
guidelines
provision.
when
guidelines
for
law
enforcement
investigations
or
prosecutions
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
circumvent
the
law,
that's
what
the
exemption
covers.
in
doing
so
it's
providing
--
congress
decided
to
extend
crooker.
it
extended
the
protections
by
lowering
the
bar
in
'86,
and
it
also
as
we
have
discussed
did
so
to
specifically
address
the
dc's
circuit's
decision
in
jordan,
or
at
least
what
might
have
been
left
of
that
after
crooker.
we
see
that
as
simply
building
on
the
back
of
crooker,
and
it
did
so
specifically
in
the
--
the
law
enforcement
context
but
it
did
so
with
the
context
that
crooker
had
properly
understood
exemption
2.
and
it's
important
to
remember
that
law
enforcement
context
in
exemption
7(e)
will
only
apply
in
a
certain
subset
of
instances.
it
has
to
be
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
it
has
to
be
--
disclose
techniques,
procedures
or
guidelines
for
law
enforcement
investigations
or
prosecutions--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--right.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
they
would
have
--
right.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
don't
know
exactly.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
this
is
going
to
--
i'm
going
to
speculate
a
little
bit
on
this,
but
--
and
if
i
am
wildly
off,
i
will
let
the
court
know.
i
think
it's
on
the
order
of
six
months,
but
it
could
be
longer.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
think
that's
for
the
basic
secret,
but
i
would
have
to
--
again,
i
don't
have
a
precise
answer
for
the
court,
and
we
could
provide
a
more
fulsome
answer
after--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--right.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
confidential,
i
believe.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
right.
but
classification
is
not
something
that
the
executive
can
do,
of
course,
just
willy-nilly.
there
are
certain
criteria
that
have
to
be
satisfied
and
there
are
certain
practical
storage
access
requirements
that
come
with
classification.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
think
it's
difficult.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
don't
think
if
we
go
that
far
it
is
practical.
plus,
in
many
contexts,
there
won't
have
--
there
won't
be
national
--
cognizable
injury
to
the
national
security,
which
is
the
touchstone
for
classification.
so
there
are
things
--
you
know,
there
are
many
types
of
information
out
there
--
for
instance,
internal
procedures
regarding
computer
security
for
agencies
--
that
just
would
not
normally
be
thought
of
as
something
that
is
classified.
agencies
also
provide
guidance
to
personnel;
for
instance,
in
screening
medicare
claims
that
come
in.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
not
classified
as
confidential.
in
order
to
be
classified,
there
has
to
be
a
determination
by
the
original
classifying
authority
of
many
things,
but
among
other
things,
it
has
to
show
that
disclosure
of
the
information
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
damage
the
national
security.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
it
depends
on
context.
i
think
the
computer
security
instructions
to
personnel,
how
you
access
and
what
criteria
you
must
build
your
computer
systems
to
be
secure
at,
i
think
that
would
be
deemed
as
internal
rules
and
practices
for
--
of
an
agency.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
it
can.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
a
little
misleading
to
talk
about
architectural
specifications
or
maps.
those
are
simply
methods
by
which
you
convey
information.
you
could
also
write
things
out
longhand.
it
would
take
a
lot
longer,
but
you
could
write
out
the
same
information
longhand,
so
long
as
it
fits
within
the
rubric
of
internal
personal
rules,
rules
and
practices
of
an
agency;
that
is,
it
is
providing
guidance,
it
is
providing
rules
and
practice
for
the
agency
personnel
to
follow
in
conducting
the
agency's
functions.
it
could
well
be
deemed
to
fall
within
exemption
2.
not
everything
would
be,
but
certain
things
can.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
no,
no,
no,
no.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
it
certainly
would
be
personnel
rules
and
practices
of
an
agency
to
be
properly
deemed
internal.
that's
where
the
circumvention
prong
comes
in
of
crooker,
and
we
believe
that
in
order
to
be
properly
deemed
internal,
the
disclosure
would
significantly
risk
circumvention
of
the
agency's
functions.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
if
i
gave
that,
and
if
i
said
so,
i
certainly
didn't
mean
to
give
that
impression.
there
are
two
different--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
--
to
bring
us
to,
maybe,
this
case,
to
give
an
example,
this
case
involves
the
esqd
information
for
indian
island.
that
information
is
a
personnel
rule
and
practice
of
the
agency,
or
is
related
to
it,
because
it
tells
the
navy's
personnel
how
to
store,
how
to
move,
how
to--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
i
guess
it's
a
question
of
how
you
convey
that
information.
if
you
said
you
can't
get
within
1,000
feet
of
point
x
and
wrote
that
out
as
an
instruction,
that's
one
way
to
do
it.
the
map
is
another
way
to
do
it.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
no.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
think
it's
essentially
the
same,
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
crooker
uses
the
predominant
internality
test,
right?
and
there's
essentially
two
things
that
the
court
is
getting
at
there.
it
says
that
that
means
that
the
agency
function
at
issue
can
have
an
impact
beyond
the
agency.
that
was
kind
of
one
aspect
of
it.
and
two,
the
court
was
concerned
about
not
having
secret
law;
that
is,
things
that
the
public
would
have
to
know
and
use
in
interacting
with
the
agency.
we
think
that
that's
essentially
the
same
thing
that
we're
doing.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
you
are
assuming
that
we
lose
the
case
entirely.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
all
right.
that's
not
an
assumption
i
like
to
deal
with
often,
but
i
think
if
the
court
were
to
rule
against
the
government
on
all
respects,
i
think
that
that
would
leave
us
with
the
option
of
returning
to
congress.
this
court,
of
course,
is
free
to
opine
on--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--there
is
a
very
large
number
of
documents
where
disclosure
would
circumvent
the
very
agency
functions
at
issue,
not
all
of
which,
and
perhaps
very
many
of
which,
would
not
be
able
to
be
classified.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
that's
true.
it's
just
that
the
exemption
2
serves
a
unique
and
important
function.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
it
would
be
a
very
large
number
of
documents,
and
it
would
not
be
practical
to
take
those
case-by-case
and
then
of
those
that
might
have
some
national
security
interest,
go--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--we
do.
there
is
a
very
large
number
of
foia
requests.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
the
statute
--
we
are
not
usually
complying
with
the
statute's
20-day
turnaround.
that's
correct.
the
--
i
think
i
ought
to
just
note
two
more
things.
petitioner's
reading
of
the
legislative
history,
i
think,
needs
to
be
corrected
in
two
respects.
the
1964
senate
report
that
petitioner
relies
upon
talks
about
rules
regarding
parking,
lunch
hours,
and
sick
leave.
that
does
not
concern
exemption
2.
that
provision
is
regarding
what
ultimately
became
section
552(a)(c)(2).
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
correct,
because
not
all
the
documents
here,
even
if
there
was
time
to
review
them,
would
fall
within
--
excuse
me,
not
in
this
case,
but
within
the
matter
of
exemption
2
--
would
not
be
able
to
be
--
exemption
2
addresses
a
special
problem.
it
addresses
the
problem
of
releasing
documents
where
the
very
release
would
frustrate
the
function
of
having
those
documents
in
the
agency
--
for
the
agency.
and
so
there
is
no
other
exemption
that
does
that.
and
requiring
congress
--
remember,
this
has
been
the
way
this
has
worked
for
almost
30
years.
there
would
have
to
be
a
very
large
number
of
exemption
3
statutes,
congress
would
have
to
go
and
enact
them
one
by
one.
it's
not
a
feasible
solution.
