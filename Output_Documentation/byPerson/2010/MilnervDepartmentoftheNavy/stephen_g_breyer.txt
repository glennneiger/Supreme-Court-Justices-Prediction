7
and
3--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
does
that
show
that?
why
doesn't
it
show
acceptance
of
crooker?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
if
crooker
was
interpreting
section
2,
that
was
the
interpretation.
if
everyone
had
followed
it,
every
court,
nobody
disagreed.
all
your
four
arguments
judge
edwards
went
into
thoroughly.
everyone
but
judge
wilkie
approved
it.
and
so
congress
reads
that,
and
they
make
it
specific
in
7
but
they
say
nothing
about
2.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
know,
what
we
have
is
7
e
in
front
of
us?
7
e
says
we
want
to
be
sure
something
like
crooker's
interpretation
of
2
applies
for
law
enforcement.
it's
simply
a
case
--
so
they
apply
it
with
law
enforcement.
absolutely
now
it's
guaranteed.
crooker
is
not
guaranteed
because
it
could
be
overturned.
you
never
know
what
will
happen.
but
what
in
that
suggests
they
don't
want
crooker
to
apply
to
the
fed
for
example,
or
to
the
navy,
which
is
here
storing
--
it's
here
storing
explosives.
why
would
--
i
can't
get
anything
one
way
or
the
other
from
the
fact
they
passed
7.
why
should
i
get
one
rather
than
the
other?
for
every
argument
you
make,
i
can
see
an
argument
on
the
other
side
that
they
make.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
answer
to
that?
it
was
a
question,
really.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
want
to
know?
how
wide
the
corridors
are
in
some
federal
buildings,
and
terrorists
could
use
that
to
bad
purpose,
but
we
want
to
give
it
to
the
firemen
because
they
will
use
it
for
a
good
purpose.
we
want
the
policemen
to
know,
we
want
different
civic
groups
sometimes
to
know,
but
we
want
to
keep
a
limitation.
we
want
it
restricted,
restricted
to
minimize
the
chance
it
will
get
into
the
wrong
hands.
i
don't
see
anything
illogical
about
that.
what's
illogical
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
a
different
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
your
four
arguments
seem
to
me
to
be
the
same
arguments
that
judge
edwards
in
the
d.c.
circuit
considered,
and
they
are
excellent
arguments,
and
there
are
arguments
on
both
sides,
and
then
they
considered
it
and
came
to
a
conclusion.
but
this
is
a
different
argument
you
are
making
here
and
i
was
addressing
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it's
only
addressed
from
law
enforcement.
it's
--
there
are
many
dangerous
--
for
example,
this
isn't
law
enforcement;
this
is
munitions.
the
navy
thinks,
rightly
or
wrongly,
i
guess
you
can
--
that
they
don't
want
these
maps
circulated
because
they
think
it
would
make
it
easier
to
blow
up
the
munitions.
they
want
the
firemen
to
have
them,
they
want
the
civil
defense
workers
to
have
them,
but
they
don't
want
people
who
might
blow
them
up
to
have
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
--
that's
their
reasoning.
now,
that
isn't
addressed,
it
seems
to
me,
in
7,
because
7
deals
with
law
enforcement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
it
--
how
is
it
broader?
i
looked
for
the
words.
i
just
missed
them,
and
you
can
point
them
out.
when
i
read
about
the
circumvention,
what
crooker
says
is:
"we
hold
that
since
the
document
for
which
disclosure
is
sought
meets
the
test
of
predominant
internality
and
since
its
disclosure
significantly
risks
circumvention
of
federal
statutes
or
regulations,
it
is
exempt.
"
it
didn't
say
anything
about
circumvention
because
there
is
a
regulated
entity
and
it
is
that
regulated
entity
that
we'll
circumvent.
it
just
spoke
of
circumvention,
as
far
as
i
saw.
but
maybe
there's
another
place
where
it
talks
about
regulated
entity.
is
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
correct,
and
i
didn't
find
anything
in
crooker
that
said
--
and
i
don't
know
why
you
would
have
such
a
theory.
i
don't
know
what
the
point
of
the
theory
would
be,
that
you
would
care
whether
blowing
up
took
place
by
somebody
who
technically
was
regulated
by
the
navy
or
blowing
up
took
place
by
some
other
person,
whom
they
are
worried
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
--
i'm
just
curious.
if
you
classify
--
suppose
you
have
a
document,
"in
case
of
emergency,
these
are
the
evacuation
procedures.
"
of
a
big
federal
building.
and
now
you
want
to
show
that
to
the
firemen
but
you
don't
want
it
to
be
in
the
newspaper.
right?
and
the
firemen
don't
have
classifications
and
they
were
not
cleared.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
guess
in
order
to
see
it
they
would
have
to
be
cleared.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
long
does
it
take,
approximately,
roughly,
to
clear
a
fireman
so
that
he
could,
in
fact,
see
the
evacuation
manual
from
the
federal
building.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
give
me
a
rough
idea?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
couldn't
return
to
congress
if
you
had
to
classify
documents
falling
into
the
category
that
you
previously
thought,
dealt
with
in
crooker.
how
long
would
that
take?
how
many
documents
would
you
guess
there
were
in
the
federal
government?
millions?
thousands?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
did
not
concern
those
documents
that
were
requested.
it
concerns
the
documents
that
might
be
requested,
which
is
every
document
that
might
be
requested.
and
i
wonder
if
it
ranges
into
the
millions,
tens
of
millions,
hundreds
of
thousands,
5,000,
or
if
it--
