chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-1163,
milner
v.
the
department
of
the
navy.
mr.
mann.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
yang.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why,
if
these
maps
are
so
sensitive
as
you
suggested,
why
weren't
they
classified?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
that.
it's
different
to
classify
when?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
surely
you
classify
documents
that
are
shared
outside
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
you
classify
these
maps
after
--
i
mean,
assume
that
you
don't
prevail,
could
you
then
classify
these
documents,
preventing
their
release
before
they
are
released?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
it
the
case
when
a
government
agency
has
to
go
through
its
records
in
response
to
a
foia
request
and
comes
upon
records
that
would
otherwise
be
disclosable,
they
can
at
that
point
say
we
are
going
to
classify
this
so
we
don't
have
to
disclose
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
you're
asking
us
to
do
your
job.
you
have
got
to
go
through
these
documents
and
say,
you
are
telling
us
how
sensitive
these
are
and
therefore
it
would
harm
the
national
interest
if
they
have
to
be
disclosed.
if
that's
true
you
can
classify
them
and,
instead
of
coming
to
us
and
saying
you
should
torture
the
language
in
foia,
to
allow
us
to
determine
that
this
is
sensitive
to
the
national
interest
and
therefore
should
be
disclosed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
that
the
amendment
to
exemption
7
really
cut
the
other
way.
they
amended
exemption
7,
they
didn't
amend
exemption
2.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
adopt
more
or
less
crooker,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
exactly,
not
this
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
for
what
level
of
classification?
i
gather
the
investigation
of
the
person
is
quite
different
depending
upon
what
level
you
want,
if
you
want
to
give--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
lower
things
below
secret--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--are
those
sufficient
classifications
to
prevent
disclosure
under
foia?
what
is
it,
sensitive--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
if
you
label
something
confidential,
you
don't
have
to
disclose
it
under
foia?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
you
wouldn't
regard
internal
security
procedures
for
computer
systems
as
confidential?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
all
of
which
you
already
have
to
review
to
compile
the
vaughn
index
and
to
make
sure
there
are
not
other
exemptions
that
are
applicable,
right?
you
don't
just
grab
a
bunch
of
files
and
turn
them
over.
you
look
at
them
before
you
release
them
under
foia.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
to
go
through
everything.
you
have
to
go
through
the
material
that
is
requested,
and
you
go
through
that
material
already.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
takes
forever
to
get
the
documents.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
mann,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
