justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
this.
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
in
crooker
has
been
the
leading
decision
in
this
--
on
this
issue
for
nearly
30
years
and
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
reliance
on
it,
certainly
by
the
lower
courts
in
general,
and
perhaps
also
by
congress
and
by
the
executive
branch.
do
you
think
there
is
anything
to
be
said
for
deference
to
that
decision
based
on
the
fact
that
it
has
been
--
there
has
been
reliance
on
it
to
such
a
great
degree
for
such
a
period
of
time?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
ask
--
i
ask
the
question
because
the
world
has
changed
in
a
lot
of
ways
since
1981,
and
one
is
that
there
is
now
i
think
much
greater
concern
about
the
disclosure
of
information
that
has
perhaps
profound
security
implications.
that
was
not
as
much
of
a
concern
in
--
in
1981.
if
you
think
about,
for
example,
suppose
there
is
a
federal
building
with
a
hallway
that
is
accessible
only
to
somebody
who
has
a
code
key.
would
that
be
--
is
that
--
does
that
have
to
be
disclosed
under
foia?
or
architectural
plans
for
a
federal
building
that
would
disclose
the
size
of
the
bomb
that
would
be
necessary
to
bring
the
building
down
or
bring
part
of
the
building
down;
is
there
any
foia
exemption
that
covers
things
like
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
have
any
reason
to
--
just
out
of
curiosity,
do
you
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
current
version
of
the
esqd
map
is
different
from
the
one
that
was
published
in
the
newspaper
previously?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
is
a
document
on
the
fbi
web
site
called
"security
clearance
process
for
state
and
local
law
enforcement.
"
which
seems
to
address
exactly
the
situation
in
which
there
is
a
need
to
--
it
says:
"it
is
the
policy
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
to
share
with
law
enforcement
personnel
pertinent
information
regarding
terrorism.
"
"and
it
provides
a
procedure
for
sharing
that
classified
information.
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
it's
practical
to
classify
all
of
the
information
that
might
have
security
implications?

architectural

passwords.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
just
nail
down
one
particular
point?
it
is
the
view
of
--
you
are
representing
the
government,
and
it
is
the
view
of
the
government
that
classification
is
not
a
practicable
solution
to
the
problem
that
is
highlighted
here.
