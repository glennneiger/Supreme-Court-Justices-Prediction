of
course,
if
that's
the
outcome
of
this
case
and
if
you
prevail,
that
would
mean
that
more
things
will
be
classified
and
withdrawn
wholly
from
scrutiny,
whereas
if
other
exemptions
are
used
they
can
be
shared
to
a
greater
extent.
so
really
what
you
are
arguing
for
is
for
withholding
more
information
from
more
people.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
that
--
if
we're
looking
at
crooker,
i
just
read
the
words
"would
there
be
circumvention",
and
it
seemed
to
me
in
this
case
the
navy
has
plans
and
they
use
those
plans
to
store
munitions
safely,
and
the
risk
that
they
worry
about
is
someone
will
get
ahold
of
the
plans
and
use
the
positions
of
those
munitions
in
order
to
make
them
unsafe,
for
example,
blowing
them
up.
so
that
seemed
like
a
very
serious
circumvention
of
what
the
regulation
was
there
for.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
--
if
the
agency
has
a
rule
that
says
put
explosive
a
in
building
1
and
put
explosive
b
in
building
2,
that's
hard
for
me
to
explain
that
it's
just
a
personnel
rule,
other
than,
as
justice
scalia
says,
everything,
all
functions
have
to
be
undertaken
by
humans.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
about
my
hypothetical?
why
--
why
is
that
a
person
--
primarily
or
solely
a
personnel
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
goes
back
to
the
point
that
--
i
forgot
about
a
computer
age,
but,
forgetting
that,
humans
have
to
do
most
things
now.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
classify
those
as
internal
procedural
rules
--
personnel
rules?
and
would
you
also
classify
architectural
specifications
as
internal
personnel
rules?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
architectural
specifications?
