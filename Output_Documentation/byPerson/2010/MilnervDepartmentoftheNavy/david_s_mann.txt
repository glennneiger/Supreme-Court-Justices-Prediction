mr.
david
s.
mann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
four
points
i
would
like
to
make
this
morning.
first,
the
plain
language
of
exemption
2
dictates
an
extremely
narrow
category
of
materials,
those
related
solely
to
internal
personnel
policies
and
rules.
second,
even
if
you
look
beyond
the
plain
language
and
look
to
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
history
is
focused,
and
the
additional
legislative
history
from
the
house
is
focused,
only
on
law
enforcement
or
investigatory
materials,
items
that
were
covered
through
the
1986
amendments
to
foia,
making
any
additional
judicial
high
2
unnecessary.
the
third
point:
because
of
foia's
purpose,
if
you
find
that
the
language,
the
plain
language,
is
not
clear
or
if
you
find
that
the
legislative
history
isn't
sufficient,
then
the
focus
must
be
on
an
interpretation
that
supports
disclosure,
not
secrecy.
and
finally,
congress
in
enacting
foia
conducted
the
balancing.
it
reserved
for
it,
itself,
the
authority
to
add
to
or
expand
foia
through
exemption
3.
it
did
not
leave
agency
discretion
available
for
the
agencies
to
decide
what
documents
they
can
provide
or
not.
moving
into
our
first
argument,
the
plain
language.
at
issue
is
a
very
short
sentence
related
solely
to
internal
personnel
rules
and
procedures
--
and
rules
and
practices.
congress
chose
to
use
the
words
"related
solely"
on
purpose.
that's
an
extremely
narrow
view.
now,
we
understand
if
you
look
at
the
words
in
isolation,
perhaps
you
could
see
that
there
is
some
conflict
between
them.
"related"
could
be
broad,
"solely"
is
extremely
narrow.
but
when
read
together,
as
they
should
be
in
this
statute,
"related
solely"
is
an
extremely
narrow
class
of
documents.
mr.
david
s.
mann
no,
your
honor.
when
crooker
came
down,
the
court
was
faced
with
an
extremely
--
a
circumstance
dealing
with
these
fbi
or
atf
search
and
seizure
manuals,
and
the
court
adopted
and
created
the
high
2
exemption.
but
again,
we
believe
in
1986
congress
dealt
with
that
expressly,
explicitly,
and
took
the
exact
same
language
and
inserted
it
into
a
stand-alone
exemption,
exemption
7(a),
making
crooker
no
longer
needed
or
necessary.
in
the
past
the
court--
mr.
david
s.
mann
--well,
your
honor,
there
could
be
a
variety
of
foia
exemptions
that
could
fit
under
7
depending
on
whether
or
not
it's
law
enforcement-related.
for
example,
if
it's
fbi
instructions
on
guarding
a
facility
or
guarding
individuals,
perhaps
that
would
be
law
enforcement.
and
if
it's
protecting
individuals
within
that
building,
under
7(f).
or
it
could
be
something
addressed
specifically
through
exemption
3.
and
coming
to
your
original
--
the
original
part
of
your
question,
that
times
have
changed,
we
recognize
that;
and
congress
recognized
certainly
that
times
could
and
would
change
when
it
adopted
it;
and
that's
why
we
believe
congress
kept
for
itself
exemption
3.
mr.
david
s.
mann
we
don't
need
to
project
--
under
judge
fletcher's
viewpoint,
we
did
not
need
to
reject
high
2
to
prevail.
but
again,
he
was
the
dissent.
but
more
importantly,
crooker
--
again
we
think
this
language
--
this
case
rises
and
falls
on
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
crooker
was
an
expansion
to
that,
and
we
need
to
accept
that
crooker
was
an
expansion
of
that,
and
congress
accepted
that
it
was
an
expansion
when
they
came
up
with
7(e).
mr.
david
s.
mann
well,
i
think--
mr.
david
s.
mann
--i
think
there
are
three
points
to
look
at
on
that.
first
of
all,
congress
originally
did
look
at
amending
section
2
--
exemption
2,
at
the
same
time
they
looked
at
amending
exemption
7.
they
chose
not
to.
now,
we
don't
--
we
can't
read
everything
into
that,
but
they
chose
not
to.
they
made
7
specifically
and
7
covered
all
of
the
language
that
we
would
be
looking
for.
so
really,
if
you
are
still
reading
exemption
2
to
include
a
high
2,
then
7(e)
becomes
superfluous.
and
then
a
final
point
and
i
think
a
very
important
point--
mr.
david
s.
mann
--no.
mr.
david
s.
mann
no,
that's
not
the
proposition
i
am
making.
the
proposition
i
am
making
is
that
when
in
1984,
'84
to
'86,
took
place
and
looked
at
this,
and
as
they
saw
the
issue
of
jordan
and
they
saw
the
issue
of
crooker,
their
decision
was
to
consolidate
that
decision,
what
had
been
called
2>
["],
into
7(e).
mr.
david
s.
mann
well,
another
point
that
i
would--
mr.
david
s.
mann
--well,
my
answer
is,
is,
you
are
correct
that
they
did
not
read
--
they
did
not
specifically
state
what
they
were
doing
or
why.
so
all
we
can
do
is
look
at
what
they
did
in
its
totality.
mr.
david
s.
mann
there
had
been
an
original
proposal.
mr.
david
s.
mann
i
would
believe
that
they
--
backing
up
to
crooker.
if
you
look
at
the
arguments
in
crooker
and
you
look
at
i
believe
every
point
in
crooker,
where
they
discuss
either
the
legislative
history
or
they
discuss
other
case
law
analysis
leading
to
high
2,
it
was
focused
on
these
investigative
materials:
examiner's
materials,
manuals,
manuals
that
we
didn't
want
the
regulator
to
have
an
opportunity
to
have.
and
that's
all
now
captured.
mr.
david
s.
mann
i
accept
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
mann
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
mann
your
honor,
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
additional
point
on
this.
by
doing
what
congress
did
in
1986
--
and
again
they
are
not
telling
us
this,
but
we
can
look
at
the
statute
--
what
they've
done
is
preserve
once
again
that
clear
distinct
line
between
the
exemptions.
exemption
2
on
its
plain
--
now
exemption
2
under
its
plain
language
is
for
use
related
solely
to
internal
personnel
matters.
that's
an
isolated
exemption.
we
don't
need
to
go
back
to
it
to
look
abroad
and
start
looking
for
other
exceptions.
we
have
exemption
7(e)
now
to
handle
that.
so
there
is
a
clear
sharp
dividing
line.
and
as
this
court
said
in
rose,
actually
quoting
vaughn,
we
needed
that
sharp
dividing
line
to
let
agencies
know--
mr.
david
s.
mann
--but
it
does
not
have
to
be
using
exemption
2,
as
its
stated,
for
strictly
internal
personnel
policies.
there
are
other
reasons
and
ways
that
some
material
that
might
create
a
security
risk
can
be
protected.
congress
has
--
there
is
over
150
--
i
believe
the
number
currently
is
153
statutes
that
they
have
enacted
under
section
3,
using
section
3.
that
includes
as
recently
as
last
year,
when
the
department
of
defense
v.
aclu
case
came
before
you.
congress
said
that
was
doing
with
the
"overly
broad"
clause.
congress
stepped
in
and
passed
an
amendment
to
the
securities
act
to
exempt
those
documents
specifically
from
release,
in
order
to
protect.
that
was
using
the
proper
authority.
it
didn't
require
an
agency
to
go
back
and
rely
on
an
2>
["],
exemption
2.
and
that's
the
danger
of
the
expansion
we
are
looking
at,
is
it
allows
exemption
2
to
be
used
for
an
open-ended.
any
time
an
agency
feels
it
may
be
appropriate
that
it
might
not
want
to
release
something,
it
can
rely
on
exemption
2.
that
was
never
the
intent.
congress
tried
from
the
beginning
to
preserve
for
itself
that
discretion
and
that
authority
and
to
remove
the
discretion.
as
we
point
out
--
as
we
set
out
for
you
in
our
briefs,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
many
of
the
agencies
and
department
of
justice
that
came
before
congress
asked
for
that
discretion,
and
congress
did
not
give
it
to
them.
they
reserved
and
instead
we
have
exemption
3.
so
what
we're
saying
is
that
you
do
not
need
to
--
there
may
be
reasons
that
you
want
to
take
high
security
information
and
have
it
isolated
from
the
public's
review,
but
it's
not
through
using
an
exemption
that
was
really
designed
for
minor
internal
matters.
mr.
david
s.
mann
i
don't
think
i
am,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
through
the
exemption
3
they
can't
limit
it
to.
for
example,
in
this
case
if
there
was
a
need
for
congress
to
adopt
the
specific
protection
for
these
maps,
it
could.
the
problem
that
we
have
here
in
this
case,
again,
is
these
maps
at
this
base
have
been
given
out.
and
again,
it's
a
map.
it's
a
map
showing
the
range,
the
size
of
an
explosion,
and
its
effect
on
the
surrounding
community.
that
map
has
been
given
out
from
this
base
to
some
people,
and
some
of
those
people
they
gave
it
to
actually
gave
it
to
the
newspaper.
it's
been
not
given
out
to
others,
including
my
client.
other
bases
nearby,
our
bangor
trident
submarine
base,
gave
out
the
map
upon
request.
if
this
map
that
we
are
looking
at
is
that
secure,
then
perhaps
it
should
be
that
secure
and
protected
across
the
board.
but
that's
not
what
we
have.
we
have
--
instead,
we
have
an
individual
within
an
agency
making
a
decision
to
withhold
a
certain
document
from
some
people
and
not
others,
and
when
they
give
it
out
to
the
others,
they
have
no
control
over
what
those
people
do
with
that
map.
and
that's
not
a
correct
use
of
the
exemption
2.
mr.
david
s.
mann
but
it
shouldn't
be
through
exemption
2.
mr.
david
s.
mann
because
it's
not
an--
mr.
david
s.
mann
--right.
mr.
david
s.
mann
it's
a
different
argument
in
the
sense
that
what
judge
edwards
was
looking
at
and
the
crooker
decision
was
looking
at
was
a
specific
group
of
documents,
these
manuals
of
policy
and
procedure.
and
again,
we
believe
that
that
was
addressed
through
the
7(e)
in
1986.
so
we
are
back
now
to:
should
there
still
be
a
high
2
category?
is
that
how
we
want
to
read
this?
mr.
david
s.
mann
well--
mr.
david
s.
mann
--i
would
agree
that
this,
perhaps,
was
not
addressed
in
7.
7
was
--
was
argued
before
the
ninth
circuit,
but
not
answered
on
whether
or
not
these
fit
under
7.
but
again,
it
should
not
come
back
to
the
use
of
exemption
2.
perhaps
another
exemption--
mr.
david
s.
mann
--your
honor,
the
issue
here
is
not
so
much
crooker
as
it
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
done
to,
we
believe,
expand
crooker,
because
you
are
correct,
obviously
the
crooker
decision
was
a
well-written,
long,
and
very
detailed
decision,
both
the
en
banc
as
well
as
the
dissents,
but
--
the
dissent.
but
even
there,
they
were
looking
at
that
same
legislative
history,
and
it's
the
same
legislative
history
that
this
court
looked
at
in
rose,
and
there
is
a
limit.
they
didn't
say
that
it
needed
to
reach
all
the
way
out
to
cover
anything
as
broad
as
a
category
of
what
the
navy's
proceeding
with
here.
they
looked
at
manuals
of
procedure,
the
disclosure
of
which
would
enable
the
regulated
community
to
circumvent
those
agency
regulations.
again,
you
addressed
that
as
arguably
dicta,
but
that
is
the
statement
you
had
made
in
rose,
that
it
was
by
the
regulated
to
circumvent
regulations.
the
documents
we
have,
for
example,
in
this
case
are
not.
the
regulated
entity
under
the
operator
5
manual
is
the
navy.
it's
how
the
navy
stores
and
moves
its
munition
around.
so
even
under
a
reading
of
--
of
crooker,
what
crooker
was
looking
at,
looking
at
the
house
report,
taking
the
house
report
on
its
face,
taking
the
testimony
before
congress
that
was
on
its
face,
again,
that
was
still
dealing
with
these
operating
rules
and
guidelines
for
government
investigators
or
examiners.
not--
mr.
david
s.
mann
--i
do.
mr.
david
s.
mann
no,
no.
i
mean,
i
--
but
what
i
was
saying
was
that
we
do
believe
it
was
quite
clear.
but
even
if
you
went
beyond,
which
obviously
they
did
in
crooker,
and
obviously
you
could
argue
from
the
house
report
--
even
if
you
go
beyond,
it's
still
a
limited
category
that
does
not
reach
so
broad
as
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
opened
up
here,
and
as
what
the
navy
is
arguing
before
you
now,
which
is
even
broader
than
what
the
ninth
circuit
reached.
mr.
david
s.
mann
well,
i
believe
it
is
addressed
in
the
decision
during
the
context
leading
up
to
the
decision,
but
it
is
addressed
by
this
court
in
rose.
mr.
david
s.
mann
but
not
by
the
regulator.
mr.
david
s.
mann
because
the
basis
--
it's
--
the
basis
for
that
is,
again,
this
court's
language
in
rose,
where
it
looked
at
--
again,
we
are
going
back
to
a
very
few
words
in
the
house
report,
and
the
house
report
is
looking
at
these
guidelines
and
manuals
of
procedure
for
government
investigators
or
examiners.
this
court
took
that
language
and
looked
at
it
and
pointed
to
--
well,
and
it's
a
logical
extension,
that
if
we
are
looking
at
it
from
these
investigators
or
examiners,
what
we
are
concerned
about
is
people
being
investigated
or
examined.
so
you
don't
see
that
expanse
here.
and
again,
it's
coming
back
to
the
basis
of
this
material
shouldn't
be
under
(i)(2).
we
can
discuss
and
debate
the
merits
and
safety
of
these
maps.
this
is,
again,
a
map.
it's
not
the
operating
guidelines,
the
operating
5
manual.
that's
not
what
was
requested
and
not
what
is
before
you,
but
what
is
before
you
is
the
map,
the
map
which
shows
that
the
largest
target,
no
surprise,
is
the
loading
dock.
the
loading
dock,
we
have
the
materials
in
the
joint
appendix
from
the
--
the
base
information,
proudly
discussing
that
loading
dock
and
how
visible
a
signal
that
loading
dock
is.
mr.
david
s.
mann
we
do
not
know,
your
honor.
there
are
--
there
are
identified,
i
believe
it
was
14,
but
i
may
be
incorrect,
separate
maps
in
the
vaughn
index.
we
know,
if
you
read
the
portions
that
we
have
from
the
operating
5
manual
say
they
can
move
munitions
around
as
long
as
they
stay
within
the
confines
of
the
esqd
map,
but
it
appears
the
map
can
be
amended.
and
again,
that's
the
prevailing
question
here,
is
we
are
talking
about
public
waters,
private
land
around
the
base,
and
whether
or
not
that
land
stays
secure.
that's
the
great
significant
public
interest
here,
is
we
have
a
city
within
a
mile
and
a
half
of
this
base
and
of
this
very
visible
loading
dock
that
can
be
seen
from
everywhere
on
the
waterfront,
restaurants
in
town.
this
loading
dock
stands
out.
so
whether
that
map
changes
over
time
would
be
important
to
know.
if
there
is
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
couple
minutes.
mr.
david
s.
mann
the
two
points
i
would
like
to
focus
again
on,
coming
back
to,
is
the
word
"personnel
matters".
when
this
case
came
to
me,
my
client
told
me
that
he
could
not
get
these
maps
that
he
had
gotten
previously
because
the
navy
was
classifying
them
as
personnel
documents.
what
is
my
reaction
as
a
lawyer?
what?
what
are
you
talking
about?
i
can
read
the
language
of
this
statute.
it's
talking
about
a
narrow
exception,
which
is
exactly
what
congress
set
up.
nine
narrow
exceptions.
the
one
open-ended
one
is
the
one
that
congress
kept
for
itself,
exemption
3.
if
the
navy
doesn't
believe
that
these
documents
can
be
or
should
be
classified,
but
the
navy
doesn't
want
to
release
these
documents
for
some
reason,
then
the
navy's
recourse
is
to
go
to
congress
as
other
agencies
have
done
and
seek
a
special
protection
for
these
documents.
but
it's
not
to
distort
the
words
"personnel
practices
and
rules"
to
expand
to
every
document
that
is
used
by
personnel.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
navy
is
asking
for
on
page
51
of
their
brief
and
we
responded
to
it
in
our
reply.
they
are
looking
for
an
exemption
that
covers
a
wide
range
of
information
concerning
internal
rules
and
practices
where
disclosure
would
risk
circumvention
and
where
other
foia
exemptions
are
unavailable.
they
are
asking
you
to
create
for
them
what
they
--
what
congress
wouldn't
give
them
in
1964
or
'66,
broad
discretion.
and
it
doesn't
belong.
it
certainly
doesn't
belong
under
the
very
narrow
exemption
2.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
am
complete.
