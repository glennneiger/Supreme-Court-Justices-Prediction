justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
though
you
--
you
said
that
--
about
exemption
7,
the
amendment
to
that,
so
you
don't
need
2,
you
still
--
as
far
as
i
know
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
weighed
in
has
accepted
crooker.
and
i
was
a
little
puzzled
why
you
were
so
intent
on
rejecting
so-called
high
2,
because
after
all,
in
this
very
case,
judge
fletcher
dissenting
to,
but
he
said
he
accepts
crooker,
he
accepts
high
2,
and
he
still
thinks
you
win,
so
you
don't
need
to
reject
crooker
to
prevail.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
--
as
i
read
the
d.c.
circuit
decision,
you
are
assuming
or
you
are
suggesting
that
the
d.c.
circuit
saw
a
gap
that
congress
hadn't
provided
for,
and
it
fills
that
gap.
and
now
the
add-on
that
the
d.c.
circuit
made
is
no
longer
necessary,
so
we
lop
it
off.
but
the
judges
on
that,
in
that
court,
thought
that
they
were
interpreting
the
statute
going
through
all
of
the
steps
that
you
outlined.
language
is
rarely
so
plain
that
there
is
no
room
for
a
different
interpretation.
and
then
judge
edwards
looked
to
the
legislative
history
to
see
how
that
might
inform
the
decision,
but
--
but
really,
to
suggest
that
crooker
was
just
sort
of
a
stopgap
until
congress
amended
the
statute
i
think
is
not
fair
to
that
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
yang,
the
information
about
location
i
thought
was
disclosed,
where
these
explosives
were
stored.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
know
they
are
in
the
building.
we
may
not
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
that
that
information
was
given
out
for
the
bangor
facility.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
you
compared
the
two
situations,
in
seattle
and
in
bangor?
what
--
because--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
we
go
back
to
the
origin
of
the
exemption
2?
i
thought
there
was
a
concern
in
congress
that
under
the
apa
section
3
was
shielding
too
much
from
the
public,
and
so
they
wanted
to
have
a
narrower
category.
now,
listening
to
you,
i
really
don't
see
how
we
have
something
that's
narrower,
--
narrower
than
the
old
section
3
of
the
apa.
and
if
you
can
give
me
an
example,
this
is
what
the
apa
shielded
that
would
not
be
shielded
under
section
2,
maybe
i
would--
