ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
start
with
one
thing
that
hasn't
yet
been
brought
up
this
morning,
and
that
is
the
context.
we
are
not
talking
about
words
in
isolation.
we're
not
talking
about
the
abstract
meaning
of
the
word
"report".
what
we're
talking
about
is
public
disclosures
of
allegations
or
transactions
in
a
congressional,
administrative,
or
gao
report
hearing,
audit
or
investigation.
and
in
that
context,
the
word,
the
phrase
"administrative
report",
the
phrase
"administrative
investigation",
has
some
meaning.
when
you
speak
of
a
congressional
investigation,
when
you
speak
of
a
gao
report,
and
when
you
speak
of
an
administrative
audit,
that
conjures
up
a
certain
image
that
goes
beyond
the
simple
search
for
responsive
records
in
response
to
a--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
don't
think
it
has
to
go
just
to
the
inquiring
into
wrongdoing.
i
think
the
way
to
think
about
it
is
whether
or
not
the
agency
or
the
governmental
entity
is
engaging
in
a
substantive
inquiry
into
and
a
substantive
analysis
of
information
of
data,
of
facts,
and
that's
the
distinction
between
what
an
agency
does
in
response
to
foia.
foia
is
a
means
of
public
disclosure.
it's
a
method
by
which
an
agency
grants
the
public
access
to
preexisting
records
that
are
in
its
possession.
it
is
essentially
the
public
disclosure
component
of
the
public
disclosure
bar--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--there's
a
substantive
analysis
of
the
facts.
for
example,
in
the
foia
context,
while
the
agency
is
certainly
pulling
responsive
records
and
is
engaging
in
some
sort
of
inquiry
into
whether
exemptions
apply
and
whether
the
information
can
be
released
or
should
be
released,
it's
not
looking
at
the
data.
it's
not
looking
at
the
information
that's
in
that
document
for
its
substantive
content.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
think
that
would
be
a
report
under
our
definition
because
the
department
of
justice
is
actually
engaging
with
the
data,
engaging
in
the
analysis.
and
if
i'm
remembering
correctly,
i
think
it
also
requires,
for
example,
the
attorney
general
to
report
on
how
it's
encouraging
compliance
with
foia
by
the
different
agencies.
and
so
i
think
in
most
of
the
circumstances
that
it
would
still
qualify
as
a
report,
and
i
think
foia
is
quite
distinct
from
that.
and
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case
in
particular,
it
demonstrates
what
the
substance
of
the
agency's
action
is
in
a
foia
case.
it's
--
again,
it's
a
means
of
public
disclosure.
congress
could
have
enacted
a
very
different
public
disclosure
bar.
in
1943
to
1986,
there
was
what
was
called
the
government
knowledge
bar.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
that's
--
that's
certainly
true,
but
the
public
disclosure
bar
requires
more
than
just
the
public
disclosure.
congress
made
the
extra
effort
and
included
only
particular
enumerated
governmental
sources.
whatever
the
line
is,
we
know
that
it
cannot
be
any
dissemination
of
information
from
a
governmental
entity.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
don't
think
the
--
two
answers
to
that
question.
one
is
i
don't
think
the
officer
engaging
in
any
substantive
analysis
of
the
facts
that
are
in
the
records
that
it's
disclosing,
but
the
second
answer
to
that
question
is
if
that's
all
that's
required,
then
i
think
we're
back
to
a
position
where
every
disclosure
of
information
by
the
government
would
qualify
as
a
public
disclosure.
and
we
not
--
we
know
that's
not
the
choice
that
congress
made.
it
included
only
specifically
enumerated
sources,
and
it
chose
particular
words.
it
chose
report,
hearing,
audit
or
investigation.
it
is
hard
to
think
of
what
other
words
congress
could
have
used
to
describe
the
type
of
report
we
are
talking
about
or
the
type
of
investigation
besides
those
words.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
have
a
broader
meaning,
it
had
a
number
of
other
types
of
words
at
its
disposal.
it
could
have
said
document,
it
could
have
said
communication,
it
could
have
said
record,
and
then
it
would
map
quite
well
on
to
what
foia
is,
which
is
the
public
disclosure
of
agency
records.
it
didn't
do
any
of
that,
and
so
i
think
we
have
to
give
some
credence
to
the
choice
of
words
and
to
the
fact
that
congress--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--no,
and
--
i'm
sorry.
the
second
circumstance
it
is,
but
let
me
--
i
answered
that
incorrectly.
the
second
circumstance
it
would
be,
but
let
me
explain
the
distinction.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
let
me
--
that
is
not
--
that's
what
i
want
to
explain,
that's
not
--
that's
not
what
happened
here.
if
i
submitted
a
foia
request
and
said
did
so-and-so
company
file
a
report,
i
wouldn't
get
a
response,
that's
not
a
proper
foia
request.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
the
second
one
would
be
a
report
if
there
was
an
investigation
going
on.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
if
--
if--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--then
--
then
i
misunderstood
the
hypothetical.
no,
it
doesn't
matter
who
signing
the
piece
of
paper.
what
matters
is
the
substance
of
the--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--in
the
government's
view
the
fact
that
the
information
was
obtained
through
a
foia
request
doesn't
answer
the
question
as
to
the
underlying
document
is
an
administrative
report
or
an
administrative
audit
or
anything
else
of
the
sort.
the
foia
--
the
agency's
response
to
a
foia
request,
again,
is
nothing
more
than
the
first--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
--
and
the
definition
--
and
--
and
i
would
be
the
first
to
acknowledge
that
there
may
be
difficult
questions
at
the
margin.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
think
based
on
your
hypothetical
in
both
circumstances,
all
that
is
done
is
the
agency
has
looked
in
its
files
to
see
if
it
has
responsive
records
and
disclose
them,
then
in
both
circumstances
that's
not
a
report
and
there
was
no--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--oh,
sorry.
in
both
circumstances.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
then
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
report
and
there's
been
no
investigation.
and
i
think
words
have
meaning,
and
it's
significant
that
foia
does
not
refer
to
what
an
agency
does
as
an
investigation.
it
refers
to
it
as
a
reasonable
search
for
responsive
records,
and
this
court
has
never
referred
to
it
as
an
investigation,
no
court
ever
has.
and
that's
because
there's
a
substantive
distinction
between
an
investigation,
certainly
between
a
gao
investigation,
between
a
congressional
investigation
and
what
an
agency
does
in
response
to
a
foia
request.
to
give
an
example,
the
gao
is
not
subject
to
foia,
but
it
does
in
its
regulation
respond
to
requests
from
the
public
much
the
same
way
that
an
agency
does
in
response
to
a
foia
request.
i
think
it
would
be
a
rather
strange
use
of
the
language
to
think
of
that
as
a
gao
investigation
and
to
think
of
the
response
as
a
gao
report.
another
example,
and
again,
we're
talking
about
ordinary
usage,
not
any
possible
usage.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
it
may
be
easy
to
apply,
but
it's
easy
to
apply
and
it
reads
out
an
entire
subset
of
enumerated
sources
that
congress
thought
important
to
include.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
on
a
prospective
--
not
--
not
directly
in
that
the
words
"report",
"hearing",
"audit"
or
"investigation"
are
still
included,
but
it
did
narrowly
and
further
define
what
that
means.
it
added
a
federal
context,
and
so
this
court
had
decided
in
graham
county
that
there
was
no
federal
nexus
required
for
the
second
category
of
documents
and
going
forward
with
the
2010
amendments
there
now
is.
and
so,
on
a
prospective
basis
--
may
i
finish?
on
a
prospective
basis,
state
audits,
state
reports
would
not
be
subject
--
would
not
bar
a
qui
tam
case,
unless
if
this
court
holds
otherwise
they're
produced
in
response
to
a
foia
request.
