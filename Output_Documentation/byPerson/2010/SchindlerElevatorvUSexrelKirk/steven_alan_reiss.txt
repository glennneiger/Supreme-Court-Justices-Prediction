mr.
steven
alan
reiss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
foia
response
is
a
report
or
investigation
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act
public
disclosure
bar.
our
position
that
it
is
allows
the
court
to
reach
the
critical
question
whether
a
relator
has
contributed
genuinely
valuable
information.
the
position
taken
by
mr.
kirk
and
the
government
would
disallow
the
public
disclosure
bar
before
reaching
that
critical
issue,
and
it
would
therefore
lead
to
a
host
of
lawsuits
by
relators
with
no
meaningful
information
to
contribute,
and
that
is
precisely
the
result
that
the
public
--
the
public
disclosure
bar
is
intended
to
prohibit.
now--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--justice--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--justice
ginsburg,
that
may
well
be
a
legitimate
use
of
a
foia
request,
and
the
question
then
becomes
whether
the
information
disclosed
in
the
foia
response
reveals
the
allegations
and
transactions
upon
which
the
qui
tam
suit
is
based.
but
that
question,
that
use
by
a
relator
of
the
foia
process,
doesn't
go
to
whether
or
not
a
foia
response
is
itself
a
report
or
investigation
within
the
statute.
a
relator
can
still
escape
the
public
disclosure
bar
if
the
relator
can
demonstrate
that
his
complaint
is
not
based
upon
the
allegations
and
transactions
that
are
disclosed
in
the
foia
response.
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
precisely,
justice
ginsburg.
in
fact,
what
a
court
should
do
is
precisely
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
very
case
in
a
very
thorough
opinion.
judge
stein
went
through
every
element
required
for
the
public
disclosure
bar
to
be
invoked,
including
whether
the
foia
response
was
a
report
or
investigation,
including
whether
mr.
kirk's
complaint
was
based
on
allegations
and
transactions
disclosed
in
that
foia
response,
and
concluded
that
every
prong
of
the
disclosure
--
public
disclosure
bar
was
met,
and,
therefore,
the
public
disclosure
bar
prevented
mr.
kirk's
claims.
and
that
is
precisely
the
analysis
that
we
contend
ought
to
happen.
under
the
government's
position
and
mr.
kirk's
position,
you
never
get
to
the
critical
inquiries
about
whether
the
allegations
in
a
relator's
complaint
were
publicly
disclosed
in
a
report
or
investigation,
because
under
their
view,
a
foia
response
itself
is
rarely
going
to
qualify
as
a
--
as
an
administrative
report
or
as
an
administrative
investigation.
we
think
that
view
is
plainly
incorrect
under
the
ordinary
uses
of
the
words
"report
or
investigation",
a
position
that
was
obviously
found
to
be
the
case
by
the
first,
fifth,
and
third
circuits.
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
well,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
an
interesting
question,
and
whether
--
and
some
lower
courts
have
held
that
if
the
federal
--
if
the
--
if
the
report
--
even
though
the
report
is
filled
out
by
a
nongovernmental
person,
such
as
yourself
in
this
instance,
it
might
still
qualify
as
an
administrative
report
because
the
information
being
sought
is
dictated
by
a
federal
administrative
agency.
now,
we
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
position
for
--
for
schindler
to
prevail
here,
because
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
a
foia
response
by
the
department
of
labor
is
itself
an
administrative
report
or
investigation.
it
is
a
federal--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--justice
kennedy,
if
the
agency
has
exercised
some
selectivity
in
terms
of
what
it's
put
in
that
reading
room,
we
would
argue
that
it
is
a
report.
that's
a
far
cry
from
what
we
have
here,
but
that's
a
much
closer
case.
but
with
respect
to
foia
responses,
the
third
way
in
which
information
is
disclosed
by
an
agency
under
foia,
it
is
always
in
response
to
a
specific
foia
request.
the
foia
response
constitutes
the
agency's
official
response
to
that
request.
it's
subject
to
appeal,
appeals
--
even
subject
to
appeal
in
the
federal
courts,
and
this
court
itself
has
had--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--it
certainly
is
a
report.
a
report
is
any
officially
sanctioned
notification.
common
understanding.
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
a
report
in
the
following
sense:
the
agency
is
saying,
one,
we
have
these
documents;
two,
these
documents
are
the
very
documents
you're
asking
for.
that
is--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--well,
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
their
response
in
handing
over
the
documents,
saying
these
are
the
documents,
is
a
report
that
we
have
these
documents;
here
are
the
documents
you've
requested.
now,
of
course--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--well,
they
are--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--it
is
a
report
in
the
sense
they're
reporting
where
to
look
for
it.
it
is
a
far
cry
from
the
foia
responses
at
issue
in
this
case
and
most
foia
responses.
in
this
case,
there
are
three
different
foia
responses
at
issue.
the
first
two
foia
responses
have
two
important
pieces
to
them.
they
say,
one,
for
certain
years
we
couldn't
find
any
of
these
vets-100
reports,
we
don't
have
them.
we
do
have
them
for
other
years.
those
responses
communicated
key
facts
upon
which
mr.
kirk
based
his
qui
tam
complaint.
he
alleged
that
in
6
of
the
years
--
6
of
the
9
years
at
issue
here,
his
allegation
is
schindler
never
filed
these
required
vets-100
reports.
the
communication
by
the
department
of
labor,
we
don't
have
those
reports
in
those
years,
was
the
sole
basis
on
which
those
allegations
are
made
and
is
clearly
a
report.
the
report
is:
we
don't
have
those
reports.
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
position
is
that
every
foia
response
is
itself
a
report
--
many
will
require
an
investigation
--
but
every
foia
response
is
itself
a
report
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
"report",
which
is
a
notification.
there
are
news
reports,
there
are
weather
reports,
there
are
traffic
reports.
there
are,
as
in
this
case,
vets-100
reports.
they
are
all
reports.
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
justice
ginsburg,
let
me
be
clear.
if
--
if
the
agency
simply
had
an
open-door
policy,
just
filed
everything
in
a
room
and
said
in
response
to
a
foia
request
those
documents
are
publicly
available,
you
can
go
in
and
search
our
files,
figure
out
if
those
reports
are
there
or
not
--
that
agency
response
would
not
be
a
--
a
report
or
investigation.
a
response
that
simply
says
do
the
search
yourself--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--we
may
or
may
not
have
the
document.
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
justice
ginsburg,
we
think
that
reports
and
investigations
can
certainly
vary
drastically
in
degree
and
kind.
an
antitrust
investigation
may
require
millions
and
millions
of
documents
and
take
the
justice
department
4
years.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
department
of
labor
itself
had
decided
to
determine
or
to
investigate
whether
schindler
itself
had
filed
these
vets-100
reports,
it
would
have
done
exactly
what
it
did
in
response
to
mr.
kirk's
foia
request.
it
would
have
--
it
went
to
--
his
request
started
out
with
the
department
of
labor
office
of
information.
it
was
sent
to
the
division
on
investigation
and
compliance,
located
in
a
completely
separate
building.
the
response
to
his
request
was
delivered
by
mr.
robert
wilson,
who
is
the
chief
of
the
investigations
and
compliance
division.
his
activity
clearly
constitutes
an
investigation,
and
the
results
that
he
gives
to
mr.
kirk
is
clearly
a
report.
there
may
be
many
other
agency
activities
that
are
far
more
detailed,
far
more
complex,
but
it
doesn't
make
what
is
done
in
response
to
a
foia
request
not
a
report
or
investigation.
they
are
still
reports
and
investigations
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
those
words.
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
absolutely,
justice
alito.
when
--
when
a
foia
response
says,
as
it
did
in
this
case,
we
didn't
--
say
it
says
we
didn't
find
certain
documents;
we
did
find
certain
documents.
here
are
the
documents
we
found.
the
attachment
of
the
documents
that's
found
is
part
of
the
report,
but
the
report
is
--
is
a
complete
report.
we
didn't
find
some
things;
we
found
these
things,
here
are
the
things
we
found;
they
meet
the
description
of
what
you
asked
for.
the
documents
being
attached
are
clearly
part
of
the
report.
now,
we
think
that
the
position
taken
by
the
government
and
the
respondent
also
creates
fairly
serious
dislocations.
under
the
definition
of
mr.
kirk
and
the
government,
many
things
that
are
actually
called
reports
by
statute
are
not
reports.
the
department
of
labor's
--
department
of
labor
reports
that
it
is
required
to
file
detailing
its
oversight
and
compliance
of
vevrra,
the
statute
at
issue
here,
is
called
a
report
under
section
1354.
the
--
the
report
that
every
agency
must
file
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
detailing
their
activities
and
their
compliance
with
foia,
itself
called
a
report
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
that
is
not
a
report
under
the
definition
advanced
by
the
government
and
kirk,
because
they
require
some
element
that
appears
nowhere
in
the
public
disclosure
bar.
they
require
an
element
of
some
kind
of
search
for
wrongdoing
or
fraud.
that
definition
appears
nowhere
in
the
public
disclosure
bar.
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
but
their
response
is
that
certain
foia
responses
will
constitute
a
report
or
investigation,
depending
on
the
underlying
documents
that
are
disclosed.
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
but
--
but
their
--
their
test
for
the
underlying
documents
is
effectively
the
resurrection
of
their
on-the-trail
notion
that
this
court
rejected
only
last
term
in
the
graham
county
case.
they
infused
that
requirement,
the
report
requirement,
with
this
notion
that
the
government
has
to
be
looking
for
something
wrong.
and
if
the
report
that
is
disclosed
along
with,
as
justice
alito
points
out,
the
foia
response
is
a
report
that
indicates
the
government
was
looking
for
something
wrong,
well,
that's
a
report.
if
it
doesn't
indicate
that,
it
doesn't
qualify
as
a
report.
we
think
that
crabbed
definition
of
report
is
not
the
ordinary
definition
of
report,
and
this
court
has
said
innumerable
times,
including
i've
heard
even
today
that
the
court
looks
to
the
ordinary,
regular
meaning
of
terms.
the
ordinary
meaning
of
foia
response.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
reserve
my
time.
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
i
don't
think
i'll
use
it
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
ginsburg,
in
response
to
your
request,
the
new
version
of
the
false
claims
act
lets
the
government
disclaim
the
public
disclosure
bar.
it
now
says
the
bar
can
apply
unless
opposed
by
the
government.
so
the
government
has
an
automatic
ability
to
stop
the
imposition
of
the
public
disclosure
bar
simply
by
opposing
it.
so
that
is
a
material
change
in
the
government's
favor
that
the
new
false
claims
act
has
made.
let
me
just
address
an
underlying
premise
that
we've
heard,
i
think,
somewhat
repeatedly
from
the
government
and
mr.
kirk,
and
that
is
this
notion
that
foia
is
simply
an
automatic
process,
that
agencies
are
a
publishing
house
or
clearinghouses.
that
notion
is
utterly
belied
by
the
statute
and
the
process
itself,
and
it's
utterly
belied
by
the
statistics
from
the
department
of
labor
in
terms
of
what
their
responses
are
and
how
they
do
them.
in
2008,
which
was
the
last
year
we
were
able
to
find
statistics
for,
the
department
of
labor,
the
department
at
issue
here,
processed
17,000
foia
responses.
only
28
percent
were
granted
in
full.
thirty-two
percent
were
denied
in
full,
10
percent,
based
on
the
statutory
exemptions,
and
22
percent
based
on
other
statutes
like
the
privacy
act,
and
40
percent
of
those
17,000
responses
were
partial
responses.
so
we
can
give
you
some
but
not
all;
and
in
fact
the
foia
responses
in
this
very
case
not
only
reported
that
we
found
some
of
the
vets-100
reports
in
some
years,
we
didn't
find
them
in
others;
but
with
respect
to
the
vets-100
reports
that
were
attached,
they
actually
made
redactions,
because
those
redactions
were
compelled
according
to
the
chief
of
compliance
and
investigations
by
the
privacy
act.
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
very--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--well--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
in
that
hypothetical
the
relator
actually
is
bringing
independent
information,
and
the
public
disclosure
bar
would
not
be
invoked
--
not
because
the
foia
response
isn't
a
report;
it
wouldn't
be
invoked
because
the
allegations
and
transactions
in
the
qui
tam
complaint
were
not
based
on;
they
were
not
disclosed
in
the
foia
response.
it
furthers
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
our
interpretation
furthers
the
purpose
of
the
statute
because
the
purpose
of
the
public
disclosure
bar
was
to
stop
qui
tam
suits
from
being
brought
by
members
of
the
public
based
on
information
equally
accessible
to
anyone
in
the
public.
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
and
what
i'm
saying,
justice
sotomayor
is
if
that's
the
case,
a
court
can
evaluate
--
certainly
can
evaluate
whether
he
is
in
fact
the
original
source,
which
would
take
him
out
from
under
the
public
disclosure
bar.
the
court
below,
the
district
court
did
that,
and
found
that
he
wasn't.
or
even
before
reaching
that
inquiry,
if
a
relator
can
say
my
qui
tam
complaint
is
not
based
upon
the
public
disclosure
of
allegations
and
transactions
and
reports,
the
bar
doesn't
drop.
our
position
is
the
appropriate
place
for
the
inquiry
that
you're
worried
about
is
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
disclosure
of
the
relator's
allegations
or
transactions.
whether--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--because
of--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--well,
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
public
disclosure
bar
was
to
stop
--
and
this
court
recognized
it
in
graham
county
--
parasitic
lawsuits
by
relators
with
no
real
significant
independent
or
valuable
information
to
contribute.
what
we're
suggesting,
as
i
understand
the
question--
mr.
steven
alan
reiss
--exactly,
justice
sotomayor,
but
our
position
does
not
resurrect
the
government
knowledge
standard
that
congress
changed
in
1986,
and
it
doesn't
do
so
for
some
very
good
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
government
--
the
government
knowledge
standard
that
the
court
--
that
the
congress
changed
in
1986
didn't
allow
a
relator
who
is
actually
the
original
source
of
the
information
to
bring
suit.
that
was
one
of
the
major
things
that
prompted
the
congressional
change
in
1986.
secondly,
and
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
in
the
senate
report,
one
of
the
primary
concerns
of
congress
in
enacting
the
statute
in
1986
was
the
fact
that
there
was
a
sense
that
government
employees
themselves
who
were
knowledgeable
about
potential
contracting
fraud
were
not
coming
forward.
in
fact,
the
senate
report
cites
a
1983
survey
in
which
73
percent
of
5,000
government
employees
responded
they
would
not
come
forward
with
evidence
of
contractor
fraud.
that
was
a
major
concern
with
congress
under
the
old
government
knowledge
standard,
the
pre-1986
government
knowledge
standard.
those
--
if
those
employees
came
forward,
the
suit
would
still
be
barred
because
the
government
by
definition
would
have
known
about
the
fraud.
under
the
new
statute,
not
only
do
you
have
the
original
source
exception,
but
if
government
employees
come
forward,
they
are
not
barred
from
bringing
those
qui
