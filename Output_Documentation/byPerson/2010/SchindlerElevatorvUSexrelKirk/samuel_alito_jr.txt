justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
is
the
question
whether
the
documents
that
are
turned
over
themselves
reports
or
whether
they
are
included
in
a
report?
i
thought
what
(e)(4)
said
was
that
you
--
you
determine
whether
it
is
in
a
congressional
administrative
or
accounting
office
report.
so
that,
suppose
the
department
of
labor
issued
what
everybody
would
concede
is
a
report
and
appended
to
that
certain
documents,
wouldn't
those
documents
be
in
the
report,
even
though
they
are
not
the
report
themselves?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
could
we
talk
about
the
test
that
you
propose?
you
say
that
a
report
is
a
usually
formal
account
of
the
results
of
an
investigation
given
by
a
group
or
person
authorized
to
make
it,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
then
an
investigation
is
most
reasonably
understood
as
an
official
probe
into
fraudulent
conduct.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
the
report
does
not
investigate
fraudulent
conduct,
then
it
isn't
--
if
something
does
not
involve
information
about
fraudulent
conduct,
it's
not
a
report?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
could
i
ask
you
about
a
document
to
which
your
adversary
referred?
the
department
of
justice
and
all
of
the
other
departments
are
required
annually
to
issue
what
are
termed
freedom
of
information
act
reports.
now,
is
that
a
report--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--under
the
false
claims
act?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
this
report
is
--
doesn't
seem
to
involve
a
process
that's
any
less
mechanical
than
responding
to
a
foia
report.
it's
basically
a
compilation
of
statistics:
how
many
requests
were
filed,
how
long
it
took
to
process
them,
exemptions
that
were
claimed,
and
so
forth.
so
what's
the
difference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
understood
the
definition
that
i
read
to
be
the
position
that
you
are
advocating,
not
simply
some
dictionary
--
some
definition
that
happens
to
appear
in
the
dictionary.
i
understood
that
to
be
the
test
that
you
were
saying
we
should
adopt.
am
i
wrong?
did
i
misread
your
brief?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
we
adopt
your
definition,
isn't
it
true
that
a
lot
of
things
that
are
labeled
department
of
labor
report,
justice
department
freedom
of
information
act
report,
are
not
reports?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you're
withdrawing
from
the
definition
that
you
proposed
in
your
brief?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
why
a
foia
response
doesn't
satisfy
the
second
circuit's
test?
an
investigation,
the
court
says,
quote,
"implies
a
more
focused
and
sustained
inquiry
toward
a
government
end.
"
now,
the
government
end
in
responding
to
a
foia
request
is
compliance
with
foia,
and
somebody
has
to
search
for
these
records
and
determine
whether
any
exemptions
apply,
and
that
would
seem
to
be
focused
and
sustained.
so
what
element
is
missing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
you
determine
which
government
ends
count
and
which
government
ends
don't
count?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
the
only
government
--
compliance
with
foia
is
the
only
government
end
that
doesn't
count?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
a
report
that
goes
to
a
department
or
agency's
compliance
with
some
law
that
is
not
directly
related
to
the
mission
of
that
department,
that
would
qualify
as
a
--
as
a
government
end
for
these
purposes,
but
foia's
the
only
thing
that
doesn't
count?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
test,
am
i
right
--
this
is
page
21
of
your
brief
--
that
it
has
to
go
to
the
uncovering
of
the
truth
of
the
matter
or
inquiring
into
wrongdoing.
is
that
your
test?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
the
test
whether
--
the
test
is
whether
there's
a
substantive
analysis
of
facts?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
--
but
when
the
--
when
the
doj
pulls
together
at
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
the
number
of
foia
requests
that
it
received
and
calculates
the
length
of
time
they
were
pending
and
discloses
that
in
the
annual
freedom
of
act
--
freedom
of
information
act
report,
that
is
a
report?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
every
report
is
a
mean
--
means
of
public
disclosure.
does
--
the
freedom
of
information
act
report
is
a
means
of
public
disclosure,
that's
the
reason
that
congress
required
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i'm
--
i'm
still
struggling
to
find
out
what
the
definition
is
of
--
of
a
report
or
an
investigation.
you
say
it's
a
substantive
analysis
of
facts.
does
not
the
person
who
processes
a
foia
request
have
to
engage
in
a
substantive
analysis
of
facts
to
determine
whether
particular
documents
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
request,
whether
certain
materials
are
covered
by
exemptions?
