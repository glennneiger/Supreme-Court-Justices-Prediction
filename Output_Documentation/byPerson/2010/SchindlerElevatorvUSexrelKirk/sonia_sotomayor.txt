so
that
means
that
if
they
tell
you
go
look
for
it
on
the
web
site
of
x
agency,
then
they
are
incorporating
everything
that
that
other
agency
has
as
part
of
their
report?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
it's
not
a
response
in
telling
you
you've
got
to
find
what
you're
looking
for?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
the
--
i
think
you've
just
divided
up
two
issues.
the
first
is,
the
foia
letter
does
tell
you
that
there
weren't
reports
for
certain
years.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
found.
now,
the
issue
is
different
from
whether
the
ones
that
were
found
were
false
or
not;
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
reiss,
assuming
that
the
government
did
all
of
the
steps
you
took,
how
does
it
promote
the
purposes
of
foia--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
find
a
document
created
by
a
third
party,
under
duty
or
not,
that
is
submitted
and
contains
false
statements.
how
does
it
promote
the
government's
interests
to
bar
an
individual
who
has
personal
knowledge
about
the
falsity
from
being
a
qui
tam
action?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
doesn't
that
seem
illogical,
meaning
the
--
the
report
filed
by
the
employer
is
not
screaming
out,
"i
filed
a
false
report".
you
need
some
outside
knowledge
from
that
statement
by
the
employer
to
prove
the
falsity.
so
how
is
your
rule
promoting
foia's
purposes?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
still
not
sure
i
understand.
here
the
relator
is
saying,
the
statement
says
we
complied
with
the
military
act,
and
he
says
they
didn't.
i
have
personal
information
they
didn't
because
i
know
they
didn't
do
x,
y,
and
z.
why
did
we
even
reach
the
questions
we
did
if
what
he's
claiming
is
that
he
was
an
original
--
that
he
has
original
knowledge
not
--
not
reflected
in
the
reports?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
still
don't
understand
how
it
promotes
the
purposes
of
a
qui
tam
action--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
put
any
kind
of
bar
on
a
relator
who
is
challenging
the
creation
of
a
document
that's
submitted
by
an
independent
party
to
the
government.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
fact
that's
not
true.
we
have
--
that
--
because
the
government's
right;
congress
changed
the
--
the
law
from
anything
that
was
in
the
government's
possession
and
narrowed
the
scope
of
the
bar.
