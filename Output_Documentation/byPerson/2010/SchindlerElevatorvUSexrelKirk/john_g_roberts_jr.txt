g.
roberts,

we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-188,
schindler
elevator
corporation
v.
united
states
ex
rel.
daniel
kirk.
mr.
reiss.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
sound
like
in
normal
parlance
if
you
come
to
an
agency
and
say
i
want
these
documents,
and
the
person
comes
down
and
says
here
they
are,
he's
not
going
to
say
here's
my
report.
he's
going
to
say
here
are
the
documents
you
asked
for;
this
is
our
response.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
information,
facts,
that
you
can
glean
from
their
action,
but
that
doesn't
make
what
they've
done
a
report.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
your
position
that
sometimes
it
can't
--
a
foia
response
can
be
a
report
and
other
times
it's
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
willens.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
most
of
the
--
maybe
i'm
--
maybe
this
isn't
correct,
but
many
foia
responses
include
more
than
just
turning
over
the
documents.
they've
got
a
privilege
log
or
other
things,
this
exemption
applies,
here's
a
document,
but
these
things
are
blacked
out,
and
they
tell
you
why.
is
that
a
report?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
not
really
because
it
does
get
into
the
assertion
of
exemptions
and
privileges,
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--things
of
that
sort.
and
why
isn't
that
a
report
of
somebody's
evaluation
of
the
particular
documents
that
are
being
released?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
person
is
--
the
person
is
separate
but
is
often
dealing
on
a
regular
basis
with
people
who
have
line
responsibilities
and
something
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
sees
something
--
well,
that
looks
like
it
might
be
a
problem
--
he
gets
on
the
phone
or
goes
down
there
and
says:
is
this
covered
by
the
exemption
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
sherry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
reiss,
you
have
14
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-188,
schindler
elevator
corporation
versus
the
united
states
ex
rel.
kirk
and
he's
asked
me
to
announce
that
for
him.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
false
claims
act
prohibits
submitting
false
or
fraudulent
claims
for
payment
to
the
united
states
and
authorizes
what
are
known
as
qui
tam
suits
in
which
private
parties
brings
civil
actions
in
the
government's
name.
the
act's
public
disclosure
bar
however
generally
forecloses
this
qui
tam
suits
that
are,
“based
upon
the
public
disclosure
of
allegations
or
transactions
in
among
other
things
an
administrative
report
hearing,
audit
or
investigation.”
respondent
daniel
kirk
brought
one
of
this
qui
tam
suits
against
his
former
employer,
petitioner
schindler
elevator
corporation.
he
alleged
that
schindler
had
submitted
hundreds
of
false
claims
for
payments
under
its
federal
contracts.
kirk
supported
his
allegations
with
information
his
wife
had
received
from
the
department
of
labor
in
response
to
three
requests
for
records
she
had
filed
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
or
foia
for
short.
the
district
court
granted
schindler's
motion
to
dismiss
concluding
that
the
public
disclosure
bar
foreclosed
those
aspects
of
kirk's
lawsuit
that
were
based
on
information
disclosed
in
the
foia
responses.
the
second
circuit
vacated
and
remanded
allowing
kirk's
lawsuit
to
proceed.
in
its
view
the
department
of
labor's
responses
to
the
foia
requests
were
neither
administrative
reports
nor
investigations
for
purposes
of
the
public
disclosure
bar.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
department
of
labor's
three
written
foia
responses
in
this
case
along
with
the
accompanying
records
are
reports
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word,
a
report
is
something
that
gives
information
or
a
notification
or
an
official
or
formal
statement
of
facts
or
proceedings.
a
written
foia
response
falls
within
that
ordinary
meaning
and
any
records
produced
with
such
responses
are
part
of
the
responses
just
as
if
they've
been
produced
as
an
appendix
to
a
printed
report.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
breyer
and
sotomayor
joined.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
in
this
case.
