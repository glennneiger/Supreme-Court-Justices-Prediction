g.

so
what
--
why
--
imagine
everything
here
is
the
same.
that
is,
what
i
imagine
happened
here
is
that
an
individual
wrote
and
asked
for
a
foia
request.
did
schindler
elevator
file
a
certain
kind
of
statement.
and
you
say
that's
not
a
report.
now,
imagine
everything
the
same
except
the
person
who
asks
is
called
joe
smith,
fraud
officer
for
the
agency.
everything
else
is
the
same.
now
is
it
a
report?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it
says,
please
tell
me
any
documents
that
they
filed
that
says
da,
da,
da,
something
like
that,
okay?
now,
we
have
the
same
thing,
word
for
word,
except
the
person
who
makes
the
request
is
not
mrs.
mary
jones
from
the
public,
the
person
who
makes
the
request
is
the
fraud
officer
for
the
agency
that's
worried
about
being
defrauded.
and
all
i'm
interested
in
is,
are
they
both
not
reports?
is
one
a
report
and
not
the
other?
or
are
they
both
reports?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
telling
you
the
facts.
the
facts
are
just
what
i
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
everything
the
same
except
he
signs
his
name,
"fraud
officer".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
then,
if
a
person
who
is
an
outside
person
gets
a
hold
of
two
documents,
one,
the
request,
and
two
the
response,
which
is
to
say,
yes,
i
found
15
reports,
they're
all
signed
by
mickey
mouse,
okay?
and
he
bases
a
complaint,
there
is
no
such
person
as
mickey
mouse,
it's
a
fraud,
okay?
then
you
go
right
ahead
and
bring
the
qui
tam
because
it
wasn't
falling
within
the
exception.
is
that
right,
in
the
government's
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
you're
repeating
--
i'm
trying
to
show
you
what
the
problem
is
in
my
mind.
i
--
i
can't
quite
work
out
the
right
definition,
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
enlightened
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
trying
to
make
a
difficult
question.
all
i
want
is
your
enlightenment
about
how
when
i
write
these
two
cases
down,
should
i
distinguish
them?
should
i
say
they're
both
the
same
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
in
most.
in
my
circumstance--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
both
circumstances.
