well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--give
us
--
give
us
your
definition.
you
say
you're
not
standing
by
the
dictionary
definition--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
was
read.
you're
--
what
is
your
definition?
it's
not
just
reports
of
investigations
into
fraud.
what
else
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
--
any
dictionary
that
gives
that
definition?
i
mean,
the
advantage
of
--
of
the
petitioners'
is
they
use
a
--
a
dictionary
definition.
it
may
be
a
very
broad
one
and
you
don't
like
it
for
that
reason,
but
it
is
the
way
the
word
is
sometimes
used.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
any
dictionary
that
would
define
the
word
the
way
you
say
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
we
have
to
say
why?
don't
we
have
to
say
why
they
are
they
are
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
once
we
have
to
say
why,
we're
--
we're
getting
into
the
need
for
defining
what
a
report
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
usually
just
say
yes,
no;
you
know,
we
usually
give
reasons.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
talk
about
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
surely,
that
should
bear
upon
how
you
read
the
--
what
you
read
the
words
to
mean.
i
had
thought
that
the
purpose
was
as
--
as
petitioner's
counsel
said,
the
purpose
was
to
allow
people
to
bring
qui
tam
actions
who
have
their
own
information
and
who
are
not
just
relying
on
information
that
they
--
that
is
not
personal
to
them.
is
that
accurate
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
only
knows
that
because
of
the
foia
response.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
--
because
the
agency
said
we
don't
have
any
reports
for
those
5
years.
why
isn't
that
information
from
the
agency
a
report
by
the
agency
that
we
don't
have
any
documents
from
those
5
years,
and,
therefore,
your
client
says
they
didn't
file
documents
for
those
5
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
client
would
search
if
they
weren't
filed,
and
on
the
basis
of
no
other
information
except
this
foia
response.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
else
does
your
client
know
that
there
were
no
reports
filed
for
these
years,
which
is
part
of
the
--
part
of
the
claim
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
wasn't
there
during
those
years,
was
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
understand
the
circumstance.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
have
to
play
these
games
every
time
there's
--
there's
--
there's
one
of
these
qui
tam
actions.
i
mean,
the
advantage
of
petitioner's
solution
is
that
it
--
it's
easy
--
it's
easy
to
apply.
i
don't
find
yours
easy
to
apply
at
all.
