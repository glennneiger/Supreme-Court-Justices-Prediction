but
suppose
the
foia
information
is
just
to
confirm,
to
back
up,
to
fill
out;
that
the
--
the
relator
suspects
there's
a
fraud
going
on,
and
he
thinks
that
the
--
the
fraud
will
be
documented
by
filings
that
the
alleged
fraudulent
party
has
made
in
the
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
each
case,
we'd
have
to
tell
what
was
the
--
the
false
claims
claim;
was
it
so
heavily
dependent
on
foia
disclosures,
or
was
the
foia
disclosures
--
say
they
were
a
minimal
part
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
i
--
if
i
submitted,
as
we
--
all
federal
judges
do,
financial
disclosure
statements
to
an
administrative
office,
and
then
someone
from
the
press
has
a
freedom
of
information
act
request
to
see
that
financial
disclosure
statement,
does
it
then
become
--
does
it
become
the
report
of
the
administrative
office,
rather
than
my
report
to
the
administrative
office?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there's
no
difference
between
a
report
--
the
government
has
an
investigating
commission
and
it
works
up
a
report
--
as
opposed
to
the
many
government
agencies
that
are
just
repositories?
they
accept
pieces
of
paper,
reports,
filed
by
other
people,
like
a
tax
return,
like
a
financial
disclosure.
the
agency
does
nothing,
has
no
input.
i
mean,
there's
surely
different
between
those
two
kinds
--
one,
i
would
say,
the
natural
understanding
would
be
it's
a
report
by
the
person
who's
filing
it
to
the
agency;
and
the
other,
where
the
agency
puts
personnel
to
investigate
an
issue,
is
a
report
of
the
agency.
and
you
seem
to
say,
no,
they're
all
reports
of
the
agency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
take
this
very
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
asking
you
isn't
there
a
difference
between
saying
we
want
the
raw
filings,
we
want
what
schindler
filed,
we
don't
want
the
government
to
do
any
investigations,
we
want
them
to
do
just
the
mechanical
thing
that
they
do
under
foia,
and
an
agency
saying
we're
going
to
investigate
and
make
a
report,
we're
going
to
put
our
people
under
the
investigators,
and
we're
going
to
interview
witnesses,
they're
going
to
examine
documents,
and
--
and
we'll
make
a
report?
that's
how
i
understand
a
government
report.
but
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
understand
how
a
report
by
schindler
becomes
a
government
report
simply
because
it
is
filed
with
the
agency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we'll
find
out
from
them
if
that
is
what
they
have
set
their
position.
i
had
not
read
them
to
say
that.
i
read
them
to
say
only
--
to
challenge
your
position
that
every
foia
response
is
necessarily
a
report
for
purposes
of
the
false
claims
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
request
a
report,
then
you
get
a
report.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
--
can
you
point
us
to
the
page
so
we
can
see
the
second
circuit's
definition
of
report
and
the
second
circuit's
definition
of
an
fca
investigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
eat
into
your
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
fca,
the
amendments
in
2009,
which
are
not
retroactive,
do
they
have
any
bearing
on
this
problem
prospectively?
