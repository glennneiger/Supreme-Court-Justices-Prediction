suppose
that
in
this
case,
the
agency
has
said:
well,
we
have
10
files
where
these
documents
are,
and
we'll
make
them
available
you
to
in
the
reading
room.
go
to
the
reading
room.
is
that
a
report?
justice
anthony
m.

well,
i
don't
know
if
the
files
are
digitized
or
not,
but
if
they
want
this
particular
veteran's
report,
suppose
you
could
just
push
a
button,
and
they
all
come
out.
is
--
is
that
a
report
when
those
veteran's
documents
are
just
put
together
in
a
rubber
band
and
shipped
off?

but
that's
the
way
the
second
circuit
defined
its
own,
or
limited
its
own
definition.
but
why
isn't
it
--
why
isn't
the
ninth
circuit
incorrect
--
pardon
me,
the
second
circuit
incorrect
when
it
says
that
this
is
not
a
governmental
end?
it
is
a
governmental
end.
