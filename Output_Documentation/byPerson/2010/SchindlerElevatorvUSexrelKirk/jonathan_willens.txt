mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
schindler
is
asking
the
court
to
construe
"administrative
report"
far
too
broadly.
in
its
view,
the
public
disclosure
bar
would
apply
to
all
foia
documents,
regardless
of
their
content.
it
would
also
apply
to
nearly
all
other
documents
created
or
disclosed
by
the
government.
this
construction
of
the
bar
would
seriously
undermine
the
operation
of
the
false
claims
act.
congress
amended
the
act
in
1986
to
encourage
whistleblowers
specifically
to
use
government
records
in
their
investigations.
this
court
recognized
that
objective
in
the
hughes
aircraft
case.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
no,
your
honor.
if
it's
a
foia
response,
it's
not
a
report.
the
--
the
documents
here
are
very,
very
typical
of
a
low-level
foia
response,
and
the
--
this
court,
of
course,
gets
more
complicated
foia
cases
with
our
first
amendment
issues
and
national
security
issues,
but
this
is
a
very,
very
standard
foia
response.
and
the
letter,
which
is
in
the
record,
is
a
very
typical
foia
response.
it's
a
form
letter
with
three
paragraphs:
we
got
your
request;
here's
what
we
found,
you
can
appeal
if
you
want
to.
they're
all
the
same.
so
for
this
purpose,
it's
useful
just
to
look
at
this
one.
that
--
there's
always
a
possibility
that
a
foia
officer
will
uncover
something
else,
a
sign
of
wrongdoing,
for
example;
but
that
--
at
that
point,
it
becomes
not
a
foia
case
anymore,
not
a
foia
process
anymore.
foia
is
very
limited
to
just
the
finding
and
releasing
of
documents.
and
for
that
reason,
we--
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
--that's
true.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
the
--
all
the
work
that
your
honor
described
goes
into
whether
or
not
that
document
should
be
released;
and
under
the
false
claims
act
test
the
release
of
documents
is
only
the
first
test
in
the
five-part
public
disclosure
bar
test.
it
--
foia
just
moves
the
--
the
document
from
the
government
files
into
the
public
and
satisfies
the
first
prong
of
the
test.
but
the
second
circuit
said
that
the
second
part
of
the
test
requires
an
examination
of
the
individual
documents
that
are
being
released.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
that's
right.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that--
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
--we
--
we
wouldn't
take
that
hard
a
line,
your
honor.
the
--
the
material
you're
quoting
comes
out
of
the
dictionary,
and
we
were
looking
for
a
good
--
it's
based
on
dictionary
definitions,
i
mean.
we
were
looking
for
a
good,
reasonable
definition
to
come
out
of
webster's
dictionary.
we're
asking
the
court
to
adopt
the
second
circuit's
definition,
which
is
broader
and
doesn't
have
an
explicit
requirement
of
investigation
into
fraud.
and
we
certainly
aren't
asking
the
court
to
rule
that
all
the
standard
administrative
reports
that
agencies
issue
all
the
time
are
not
reports.
but
it's
very
useful
in
a
close
case
where
the
document
doesn't
say
this
is
the
administrative
report
or
the
report
of
staff
on
a
particular
issue
--
it's
very
helpful
in
a
close
case
to
look
at
the
context
of
the
statute.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
yes.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
and
we've
argued
that
because
the
foia
uses
the
word
"response"
for
the
documents
we're
talking
about
today
and
uses
the
word
"report"
for
that
document
that
goes
to
congress,
it
must
have
understood
those
words
to
mean
different
things.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
well,
foia
is
a
special
case,
your
honor;
that's
the
first
difference.
it
only
looks
into
whether
or
not
documents
should
move
from
government
files
into
the
public,
and
we're
suggesting
that
because
there's
such
a
strong
government
purpose
in
encouraging
whistleblowers
to
bring
those
documents
out,
that
in
order
to
give
meaning
to
the
list
of
enumerated
sources
here
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
documents
are
there,
that
are
coming
out.
you
can
look
at
this
foia
cover
letter,
and
i
think
you'll
see
that
it
doesn't
have
any
substantive
content
to
it.
it
just
refers
to
the
investigation,
or
it
refers
to
the
foia
search
that
was
--
that
took
place
here.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
in
a
lot
of
ways
--
sorry.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
right.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
on
the
investigation
side,
it's
a
definition
--
the
definition
is
a
focused
and
sustained
inquiry
toward
a
government
end,
a
substantive
government
end
that
would
have
to
do
with
the
policies
and
practices
of
the
--
of
the
agency;
that
is,
uncovering
noncompliance
or
assembling
information
about
a
policy
program
or
something
like
that.
we're
trying
to
distinguish
that
from--
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
--it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
that's
the
second
circuit's
holding,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
why
we
spent
a
large
part
of
our
brief
explaining
why
there's
a
better
dictionary
definition
than
the
one
that
petitioner
uses.
one
important
difference--
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
--i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
we
--
we
believe
that
that's
a
good
definition
that
could
be
used,
your
honor,
but
the
trouble
is
that
there's
not
going
to
be
any
dictionary
definition
that
covers
all
the
innumerable
ways
that
"administrative
report"
can
be
used.
and
i
wanted
to
just
--
to
answer
your
earlier
question
to
say
that,
of
course,
there
are
standard
administrative
reports
that
agencies
issue.
the
--
the
courts
below
have
been
resolving
this
kind
of
issue
outside
the
foia
context
for
25
years
since
this
statute
was
passed
without
any
serious
trouble.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
told
you
that
the
second
circuit's
definition,
if
you're
looking
for
an
overarching
definition,
is
a
better
one.
the
trouble
there--
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
--i
--
i
believe
they
are
both
helpful,
your
honor,
and
i
also
believe
that
the
--
the
second
circuit's
definition
covers
all
of
these
kinds
of
reports,
but
there's
no
need
for
this
court
to
issue
its
own
definition.
there's
another
way
of
resolving
this
case,
which
is
simply
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
foia
responses,
which
are
unique
in
many
respects,
and
have
their
own
statutory
and
regulatory
structure,
are
administrative
reports
or
investigations
on
their
own
terms.
and--
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
--of
course,
you
have--
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
--well,
i
--
it
would
be
possible--
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
--i
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
but
point
two
of
our
brief
is
an
explanation
of
why
it
makes
sense
not
to
have
a
categorical
rule
that
every
foia
response
and
all
of
its
attachments
are
always
administrative
reports
and
investigations.
and
i
submit
you
don't
have
to,
to
find
administrative
report
an
investigation
for
all
purposes
in
order
just
to
answer
that
narrow
question.
for
example,
the
word
"investigation"
is
used
in
the
false
claims
act
for
a
very
specific
kind
of
investigation:
a
law
enforcement
investigation.
and
a
foia
search,
which
is
defined
in
that
statute
as
a
review,
is
not
an
investigation.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
statute
has
always
encouraged
both
insiders
and
people
who
are
dealing
with
secondhand
information,
what
we
used
to
call
private
attorney
generals,
to
go
out
and
do
their
own
investigation.
and
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1986
to
encourage
those
people
and
insiders
like
mr.
kirk
to
get
documents
out
of
the
government
files
that
they
need
as
evidence
to
support
their
case.
the
case
doesn't
lack
merit
simply
because
the
whistleblower
needs
additional
evidence
to
prove
his
case
in
court,
and
foia
is
a
critical
aspect
of
that
because
relators
frequently
don't
have
one
piece
of
information,
which
is
what
their
corporation
said
to
government
contracting
officers.
that
is,
mr.
kirk,
for
example,
knows
operationally
--
he
knows
that
every
contract
schindler
had
for
15
years
was
breached
because
they
were
not
following
the
key
contractual
provision
to
abide
by
the--
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
there
were
a
few
statements
wrapped
up
in
that
--
in
that
question,
your
honor.
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
mr.
kirk
has
a
vast
amount
of
inside
knowledge
about
this
breach
of
contract
that
was
going
on
for
so
many
years,
and
it's
different
from
the
notification
requirement.
that's
what
triggers
the
false
claims
act
liability.
but
it's
different
from
saying
that
there
was
a
fraudulent
scheme
going
on
for
10
or
15
years
that
damaged
the
government,
damaged
the
veterans
employed
by
the
company,
and
--
and
undermined
the
whole
purpose
of
vevrra
that
requires
it
to
be
in
these
contracts.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
it
said
--
the
word
is
that
reports
were
not
found.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
that's
true,
and
i
would
say
it's
also
different
from
the
issue
of
whether
they
were
filed,
because
the
fact
that
the
agency
didn't
find
them
during
a
cursory
review
of
its
records,
which
is
--
a
reasonable
review
of
the
records
is
all
it's
required
to
do.
in
a
compliance
investigation,
of
course,
they
would
go
on
much
further.
they
would
look
to
see
if
the
documents
were
filed
somewhere
else.
if
they--
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
--it's
not
no
other
information,
your
honor.
it's
a
pattern
of--
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
--he
knows
that
schindler
did
not
collect
the
information
that
it
would
have
needed
in
order
to
file
accurate
reports.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
he
was
only
not
there
during
the
very
tail
end
of
our
period,
which
runs
from
1999
to
2005.
he
was
there
and
he
was
fired
or
let
go
in
the
middle
of
2003,
so
he
has
personal
knowledge
of
all
of
that
failure
to
collect
the
information.
the
question,
then,
is
whether
schindler
filed
false
reports
or
failed
to
file
them
at
all,
and
he
alleged,
without
reference
to
the
foia
response,
that
it
had
to
be
one
or
the
other.
and
either
way,
it's
going
to
be
a
violation,
and
that's
sufficient
at
this
stage
of
the
case.
we're
the
12(b)(1)
motion,
your
honor.
i
haven't
had
an
opportunity
for
discovery
and
we
don't
know
anything
else
about
schindler's
conduct,
but
it's
--
it's
not
correct
to
say
that
--
well,
i
think
i've
answered
the
question.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
the
--
there's
a
missing
government
end
here
because
all
that's
happening
is
the
transmission
of
documents
from
inside
the
agency
to
the
outside
the
agency.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
obviously,
satisfying
the
requirements
of
foia
and
its
regulations
is
a
government
end
to
that
extent,
but
the
second
circuit
was
trying
to
distinguish
between
the
substantive
work
of
an
agency
and
the
more
ministerial
but
still
important
act
of
taking
documents
out
of
files
and
sending
them
out
to
the
public.
a
foia
officer
is
--
is
separate
and
apart
in
most
cases
from
other
programmatic
officers
in
an
agency,
because
we
want
to
keep
that
act
of
taking
documents
out
of
the
files
and
making
them
public
separate
from
people
who
might
not
want
those
documents
to
go
out
into
the
files
into
the
public.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
of
course.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
of
course.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
they
don't
speak
to
them.
it's
just
that
there's
a
different
line
of
authority
in
most
cases,
and
it's
a
different
kind
of
mission.
so
i
--
i
hear
the
question,
and
i
understand
the
problem,
but
at
some
point
you
need
to
distinguish
between
what
foia's
trying
to
do,
which
is
to
make
documents
public,
and
what
the
government
agency's
work
is,
which
is
to
implement
its
policies,
procedures,
sign
contracts,
build
roads
and
whatever
else
it
does.
there's
such
a
strong
government
purpose
in
getting
these
documents
out
to
the
public,
and
specifically
in
this
case
to
relators
and
whistleblowers
that
this
court
has
held,
15
--
has
held,
almost
15
years
ago,
that
that
is
why
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1986,
and
to
tell
the
congress
now
25
years
later
that
they
made
a
mistake
when
they
used
the
word
foia
to
cover
everything.
but
instead,
congress
chose
a
very
narrow
set
of
enumerated
sources,
specifically
so
that
other
documents
would
be
available
to
relators.
as
i
tried
to
say
before,
getting
those
foia
documents
out
to
a
relator
is
particularly
important,
because
it
has
the
correspondence
between
schindler
or
other
contractor
and
the
government.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
my
only
argument
is
that
foia
is
a
different
kind
of
mission.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
i
believe
foia
is
a
special
case,
your
honor,
and
there
are
many
reasons
why
that
--
that
would
be
the
case.
we've
argued
that
the
--
the
plain
language
of
foia
indicates
that
a
response
is
not
a
report;
a
search
is
not
an
investigation.
mr.
jonathan
a.
willens
foia
is
the
only
thing
that
--
that
doesn't
count.
it's
like
a
publishing
house
or
a
little
clearing
house
inside
each
agency
whose
job
is
to
take
manuscripts,
or
in
this
case,
reports
or
audits
or
hearings
or
whatever,
and
take
them
out
into
the
public.
i
think
it's
fair
to
distinguish
between
that
function,
the
publication
function,
and
the
substantive
work
of
the
agency.
if
you
don't
do
that,
then
you're
heading
down
a
slippery
slope
which
schindler
eloquently
articulated
in
its
reply
brief.
you
end
up
at
a
point
where
not
only
foia
documents
are
covered,
but
non-foia
documents,
in
one
case,
even
sec
filings,
private
sec
filings
that
are
automatically
posted
to
the
commission's
computer,
schindler
seems
to
think
that
those
are
administrative
reports.
and
you've,
of
course,
transformed
every
private
document,
like
these
vets-100
reports,
into
public
documents
simply
by
the
process
of
corporate
filing
and
then
release
by
the
government.
there's
simply
no
basis
for
that
in
the
statute,
and
it
would
cause
enormous
harm
to
the
operation
of
the
statute.
thank
you.
