justice
clarence
thomas
the
--
this
case
has
come
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certio
--
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
--
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeal
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
telecommunications
act
of
1996
requires
incumbent
local
telephone
providers
like
--
or
such
us
respondent
at&t
to
share
certain
parts
of
their
physical
networks
with
competitors
at
cost-based
prices.
this
case
concerns
an
incumbent's
obligation
to
lease
entrance
facilities
which
are
typically
wires
or
cables
that
connect
to
networks.
entrance
facilities
can
be
used
for
two
different
purposes.
one
is
called
"backhauling"
and
the
other
is
called
"interconnection".
the
fcc
recently
decided
that
incumbent
local
telephone
providers
are
not
required
to
lease
entrance
facilities
for
backhauling.
it
emphasized
however,
that
it
was
not
changing
incumbent's
existing
obligation
to
provide
facilities
necessary
for
interconnection.
after
the
fcc's
decision,
at&t
notified
its
competitors
that
it
would
no
longer
provide
entrance
facilities
at
cost-based
prices
for
either
backhauling
or
interconnection.
the
competitors
argued
that
at&t
was
violating
its
duty
to
provide
interconnection.
the
district
court
ruled
that
at&t
--
ruled
for
at&t
and
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
no
statute
or
regulation
expressly
addresses
at&t's
obligation
to
lease
its
entrance
facilities,
we
look
to
the
fcc's
interpretation
of
its
regulations
in
its
amicus
brief.
the
fcc
argues
that
an
incumbent
must
lease
existing
entrance
facilities
to
competitors
at
cost-based
rates
if
the
facilities
are
to
be
used
for
interconnection.
we
find
the
fcc's
interpretation
reasonable
and
defer
to
that
interpretation.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
scalia
has
filed
the
concurring
opinion.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
