mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
a
lot
of
statements
by
the
fcc
at
issue
in
this
case,
but
i
would
like
to
focus
on
two
statements
by
the
commission
in
its
published
regulation
and
orders
that,
taken
together,
resolve
the
question
presented
here.
and
the
first
is
the
commission's
determination
in
47
cfr
51.305(e),
which
appears
at
page
5a
of
michigan's
brief,
that
it
is
the
competitor,
not
the
incumbent,
that
gets
to
select
the
point
at
which
interconnection
takes
place.
specifically,
that
regulation
says
that
if
an
incumbent
wants
to
deny
a
request
for
interconnection,
it
has
--
at
a
particular
point,
it
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
interconnection
at
that
point
would
be
technically
infeasible.
and
that
undercuts
a
key
premise
of
the
decision
below,
which
was
that
as
long
as
the
incumbent
provides
interconnection
at
some
technically
feasible
point
that
it
has
selected
then
it's
discharged
its
obligation,
and
if
the
competitor
doesn't
like
it,
that's
just
too
bad.
they
can
build
their
own
facility
if
they
want
to
interconnect
somewhere
else.
that's--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--in
terms
of
the
definition
of
technical
feasibility,
that's
a
defined
term
in
section
51.5
of
the
regulations,
and
it
does
not
include
economic
considerations.
nonetheless,
as
the
commission
explained
when
it
adopted
those
regulations
in
1996
at
paragraph
209
of
the
local
competition
order,
competitors
have
an
incentive
to
ask
for
an
economically
efficient
means
of
interconnection,
because
they
have
to
pay
for
it.
i
mean,
the
--
they
don't
pay
as
much
as
at&t
would
like
--
they're
paying
telric
rates
--
but
they
do
still
have
to
pay
for
interconnection,
so
they
have
incentive
to
ask
for
a
reasonable
method
of
it.
and
what's
at
issue
in
this
case,
to
get
to
the
second
part
of
your
question--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that
--
that's
right.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
--
the
second
is
the
commission's
determination
in
the
triennial
review
remand
order
in
response
to
the
d.c.
circuit's
remand
of
its
previous
order,
that
entrance
facilities
are
indeed
part
of
the
incumbent's
network,
because
the
statutory
obligation,
of
course,
is
to
allow
interconnection
at
any
technically
feasible
point
within
the
incumbent
carrier's
network.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
in
paragraph
137
of
the
triennial
review
remand
order,
which
appears
at
page
10a
of
michigan's
brief.
and
in
the
preceding
paragraph,
the
commission
traced
the
history
of
its
definition
of
the
dedicated
transport
network
element
and
the
local
competition
order,
its
revision
of
that
in
the
triennial
review
order,
in
which
it
had
said
that
the
facilities
are
not
part
of
the
network.
the
d.c.
circuit
then
vacated
that.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i've
--
i've
just
gone
back
to
the
previous
two
pages,
but
it
--
10a
is
paragraph
137,
where
the
court
says
in
response
--
excuse
me
--
where
the
commission
says,
in
response
to
the
court's
remand,
that's
the
d.c.
circuit's
remand
in
the
usta
case,
we
reinstate
the
local
competition
order
of
dedicated
--
order
definition
of
dedicated
transport.
and
that
was
a
definition
of
a
network
element
that
included
entrance
facilities.
so
what
the
commission
was
saying
there
by
its
reference
back
to
that
definition--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that
--
that's
correct,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
perceived
a
contradiction
between
saying
that
this
isn't
something
to
which
you
have
to
provide
unbundled
access
under
(c)(3),
but
it
is
something
that
has
to
be
made
available
for
interconnection
under
(c)(2).
and
there
is
no
contradiction
there,
because
these
are
separate
independent
statutory
obligations,
and
what's
particularly
significant
about
the
difference
between
the
two
statutes
--
statutes
is
that
(c)(3)
has
an
impairment
test.
you
only
have
to
make
available
those
network
elements
without
which
the
competitor
would
be
impaired
in
its
provision
of
service.
(c)(2)
does
not
have
an
impairment
test,
and
that's
because
congress
recognized
that
interconnection
is
absolutely
fundamental
to
any
effective
telephone
competition.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
if
you're
referring
to
the
--
what
the
--
in
the
way
the
commission
used
those
terms
in
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--an
entrance
facility--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--an
entrance
facility,
as
the
commission
explained
in
the
trro,
is
just
the
link
between
the
incumbent's
office
and
the
competitor's
office.
and
an
interconnection
facility
is
anything,
any
part
of
the
network
that's
being
used
for
interconnection.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
it
can
be.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
it
--
it
can
be
when
it
is
used
for
interconnection.
it
could
also
sometimes
be
used
for
other
things,
but
we're
talking
about
the
situation
where
the
competitor
wishes
to
use
the
entrance
facility
for
interconnection.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
--
the
entrance
facility
is
just
the
link
between
the
two
offices,
the
incumbent's
and
the
competitor.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that
can
be
used
for
a
couple
of
different
purposes,
but
one
of
the
purposes
for
which
it
can
be
used
is
interconnection.
and
when
it
is
being
used
for
that
purpose,
it
is
appropriately
described
as
a
--
as
an
interconnection
facility.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
we
--
we
agree
with
the
view
expressed
by
judge
sutton
in
his
dissenting
opinion
below
that
there
really
is
no
reason
to
distinguish
between
amicus
briefs,
particularly
those
filed
at
the
invitation
of
a
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
from
those
file
--
filed
here.
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
question
of--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
our
briefs
in
--
in
the
two
cases
are
consistent.
our
brief
here
provides
more
detail
in
explaining
the
commission's
orders,
but
in
both
cases
we
have
taken
the
view,
as
the
commission
has
consistently
taken
the
view
since
the
trro,
that
entrance
facilities
don't
have
to
be
made
available
as
unbundled
elements
for
purposes
of
back
haul,
but
they
do
have
to
be
made
available
when
the
incumbent
seeks
to
use
them
for
interconnection.
i
think
this
is
precisely
the
sort
of
case
where--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no,
they
--
they--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
right.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
exactly.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
right.
and
it's
only
for
purposes
of
--
of
interconnection.
and
i
think
this
is
precisely
the
sort
of
case
where
deference
under
auer
is
appropriate,
given
that
you
have
a
highly
complex
statute
regulating
a
very
complex,
dynamic
industry,
and
so
the
commission's
regulations
involve
not
only
the
exercise--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--another
way
of
saying
that
would
be
that
it's
appropriate
to
recognize
the
commission's
not
only
policy-making
discretion,
but
technical
expertise
in
the
industry
that's
being
regulated.
and
certainly
the
commission
has
tried
to
be
as
clear
as
it
can
in
its
regulations,
but
this
is
an
area
where
some
level
of
imprecision
is
probably
inevitable,
and
i
think
that's
why
it's
appropriate
to
defer
to--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
i
guess
i
would
say
maybe
we
need
to
put
the
difference
between
interconnection
and
transport
in
concrete
terms.
it
would
be
the
interconnection
charge
which
is
at
telric
rates
under
252(d)(1).
there
would
be
a
flat
fee
for
setting
it
up,
and
then
a
flat
monthly
fee
just
for
having
the
link
there.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
thank
you.
and
that's
independent
of
usage.
then,
separately,
each
time
a
call
is
made
there
is
a
charge
under
252(d)(2)
for
the
transport
and
termination
of
the
call.
and
that
goes
both
ways.
so
when
the
competitor's
customer
calls
the
ilec,
the
customer
--
the
competitor
pays
the
ilec
for
terminating
the
call
and
vice
versa.
