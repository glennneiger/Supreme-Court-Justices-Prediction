justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
would
i
read
this?
as
i
read
the
statute,
the
statute
says
the
cheap
system
here
is
where
they
provide
--
they
have
a
duty
to
provide
the
incumbent
interconnection,
okay?
that
requires
some
physical
stuff.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
and
they
have
to
--
they
--
you're
not
charged
a
lot
for
that;
there's
a
limit
on
what
they
can
charge
you
for
the
interconnection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
decide
whether
if
pacific
tel
and
tel
is
being
tried
to
forced
to
connect
with
maine,
you
know,
they
have
to
pay
for
a
wire
across
country
to
get
the
interconnection
or
not?
that
seems
unreasonable.
across
the
street,
maybe
they
do.
my
candidate
would
normally
be
the
fcc
or
some
regulator
decides
that
kind
of
thing,
and
it's
up
to
them
to
say
whether
this
is
or
is
not
what's
needed
for
interconnection.
that
would
be
an
intuitive
account
i
would
have,
without
having
read
the
statute
in
depth.
so
now
what
do
i
read
to
find
out
how
this
works?
what
is
it
that
distinguishes
something
that
is
ridiculous,
like
my
california
example,
from
something
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense,
like
they're
next
door
and
have
to
make
50
feet
of
wire.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
michigan
blue--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
--
where
--
28a,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
it's
up
to
the
state
commission.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
the
fcc
speaking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
the
state
commission
says
--
they
say
it's
up
to
the
state
commission.
and
the
state
commission
here
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
go
back
to
my
question?
because
i
haven't
gotten
an
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
think
--
you
said,
well,
this
is
an
existing
facility.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
my
intuition
would
be,
that
makes
no
difference
whatsoever.
you
could
have
some
kind
of
mechanism
that
connects
two
companies.
now,
half
of
it
is
a
simple
wire
and
half
of
it
is
bells
and
whistles,
and
so
we
have
to
decide
which
part
is
the
part
that's
necessary
for
the
interconnection
and
which
part
is
some
kind
of
--
well,
i
don't
know,
extra
bells
and
whistles,
and
therefore,
since
it's
not
an
impairment
kind
of
problem,
they
have
to
pay
full
price
for
it.
that,
again,
seems
like
the
kind
of
job
that
congress
would
leave
up
to
a
commission,
but
i
guess
i
want
you
to
tell
me:
who's
to
decide
that
kind
of
thing,
and
how
do
we
decide
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
often,
these
things
are
not
distance.
often
a
connection
is
all
kinds
of
complex
things,
you
know?
and
some
are
necessary
and
some
aren't.
but
i
can
--
can't
you
imagine
with
me
the
same
kind
of
california
problem
arising,
but
it
just
arises
in
--
in
kind,
rather
than
in
distance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i'm
so
far
off
base
you
can't
get
the
question,
forget
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
might
not
be
able
to
get
an
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
do
i
find
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
the
definition
difference
between
entrance
facility
and
interconnection
facility?
how
do
we
know
which
is
which?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i'm
not.
i
want
to
know
what's
the
difference.
tell
me
in
english
what
the
difference
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
mean,
how
do
we
know
which
is
which?
we
see
some
big
lines
and
stuff
in
it;
how
do
we
know
which
is
which?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
--
what
i
--
there's
no
way
for
you
all
to
go
to
the
fcc
and
decide
what
part
of
this
thing
is,
or
any
state
regulator,
what
part
of
it
is
--
part
of
what's
necessary
to
facilitate
interconnection
and
what
part
of
it
is
really
providing
the
work
primarily
of
the
--
simply
transporting
services?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
part
is
doing
something
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
no
way
to
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
a
judge
has
to
say,
on
the
basis
of
what,
on
the
basis
--
the
judge
has
to
say
on
the
basis
of
the
statute,
which
just
uses
the
word
interconnection?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
help
because
it's
a
network
element,
if
it's
in
(3)
and
what
this
is,
is
something
that's
going
to
be
needed
to
--
to
interconnect.
if
it's
--
if
it's
in
--
if
it's
in
the
first
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
don't
know
which
is
which,
and
i
gather
that
sometimes
it
would
be
tough,
and
what
courts
use
to
do
with
the
icc
when
they
got
into
this
kind
of
situation
is
a
doctrine
called
primary
jurisdiction,
and
they
would
ask
them
for
a
brief.
all
right?
so
if
that's
what
we've
done
hypothetically,
we
have
the
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
why
don't
we
have
to
follow
the
brief?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says
the
carriers
have
a
duty
to
provide
interconnection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
in
carrying
out
a
duty
to
provide,
you
say
that's
just
picking
the
point,
that
somebody
could
equally
well
say,
no,
it's
a
duty
to
provide
means
to
get
to
the
point.
now,
either
of
those
seem
equally
consistent
with
the
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
doesn't
say
that,
but
it
doesn't
say
the
opposite,
and
therefore,
you
might
have
an
agency
reasonably
deciding
that
to
--
to
fulfill
that
duty,
you
must
provide
equipment
reasonably
necessary
to
allow
the
competitor
to
connect.
that's
equally
sensible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
apparently,
you
have
an
agency
that
never
really
said
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
what
the
other
--
i
didn't
hear
anything
that
said
they
said
the
other.
they
said
when
you
have
wires
and
you're
using
the
wires
for
communication,
then
they
don't
fall
outside
of
this;
that's
true.
but
if
you're
using
them
for
interconnection,
and
they're
necessary
to
use
for
interconnection,
maybe
it
does
fall
inside
this.
i
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
excluded
--
they
excluded
transport
--
all
transport
to
the
point
of
interconnection,
where
you
could
not
provide
the
facility
to
interconnect
unless
you
had
the
transport?
is
that
what
they
did?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
they
do
that?
yes
or
no?
i
bet
the
answer
is
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
are
--
there
are
cases,
i
think,
in
primary
jurisdiction
where
what
a
district
court
has
done,
anyway,
is
to
hold
the
case
while
the
icc
went
and
had
a
proceeding,
and
i'm
sure
that
hasn't
been
used
in
a
long
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
this
is
the
case
for
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
all
didn't
matter
because,
in
fact,
they
got
the
telric
rates
under
(c)(3)
until
they
changed
the
impairment
part?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
who
cared.
and
now
after
that
they
care.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
--
now
--
now
the
other
side
cares,
of
course,
and
so
now
--
now
we're
faced
with
a
situation
where
they're
just
putting
this
in
the
brief
for
the
first
time
but
they
can't
base
it
on
anything
the
commission
actually
did?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
glad
it's
right
because
i
don't
know
what
i'm
talking
about.
[laughter]
