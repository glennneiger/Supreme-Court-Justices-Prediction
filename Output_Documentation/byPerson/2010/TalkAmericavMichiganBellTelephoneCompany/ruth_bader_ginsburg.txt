doesn't
it
say
something
about
feasible?
it
--
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
give
free
choice
entirely.

what
are
the
words?
that
the
interconnection
doesn't
have
to
be
put
just
anyplace
if
it's
not
feasible,

it's
undue
expense
or
something
to

that's
why
it's
only
technically
feasible,
because
the
economic
burden
is
--
is
not
on
the
company?
it
has
to
provide
it
at
the
place
if
it's
technically
feasible,
but
it
doesn't
pay

it?

mr.
miller,
would
you,
before
you
sit
down,
explain
what
is
the
government's
position
when
an
agency
is
asked
to
file
a
brief?
the
sixth
circuit
asked
--
invited
the
fcc
to
file
a
brief,
it
did,
and
then
the
sixth
circuit
disagreed.
and
there
was
some
suggestion
that
when
an
agency
files
a
brief
here
in
this
court,
as
opposed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
deserves
more
weight.
