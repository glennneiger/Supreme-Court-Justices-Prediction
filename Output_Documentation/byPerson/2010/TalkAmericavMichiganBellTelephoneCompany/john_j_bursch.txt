mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
interconnection
is
the
lifeblood
of
local
phone
competition.
that
is
why
in
section
251(c)(2)
of
the
telecommunications
act
congress
guaranteed
that
competitors
would
have
interconnection
at
the
location
and
at
the
method
of
their
choosing
and
at
telric
rates
irregardless
of
market
impairment.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
251(c)(2)
obligation
encompasses
the
tens
of
thousands
of
existing
entrance
facilities
that
even
today
are
interconnecting
competitive
and
incumbent
networks,
and
the
answer--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes,
you
do,
your
honor.
you
get
(c)(2)
and
(c)(3)
at
telric
rates.
and
so
the
answer
to
the
question
presented
is
yes,
for
three
reasons.
first,
because
the
fcc
says
so
and,
as
the
expert
agency
charged
with
interpreting
and
implementing
the
act,
that
conclusion
is
entitled
to
deference.
second,
the
fcc's
conclusion
is
consistent
with
the
plain
text
of
the
statute
and
the
implementing
regulations.
and
third,
the
fcc's
conclusion
is
consistent
with
the
policies
embodied
in
the
act,
because
the
practical
result
of
affirming
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
in
this
case
is
that
a
competitive
carrier,
like
sprint
for
example,
will
be
forced
to
either
charge
its
customers
more
for
interconnection
or
lay
tens
of
thousands
of
duplicate
entrance
facility
cables,
and
those
are
precisely
what
the
act
were
designed
to
prevent.
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
sixth
circuit
opinion,
and
specifically
this
is
at
page
20a
of
the
talk
america
cert
petition
appendix,
because
this
goes
to
the
heart
of
at&t's
position
and
the
sixth
circuit's
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
orange
plugs
and
cords
analogy.
you
will
recall
that
the
sixth
circuit
said
this
was
like
a
situation
where
a
homeowner
had
a
plug
in
their
garage
and
a
long
orange
cord
extending
out
to
a
park,
which
the
court
called
the
entrance
facility,
and
then
the
competitive
carrier
would
be
that
person
in
the
park.
on
page
20a
of
the
petition
appendix
in
footnote
9,
about
halfway
down,
this
is
the
key
flaw
in
the
sixth
circuit's
reasoning.
the
sixth
circuit
says
if
you,
as
the
homeowner,
that's
the
--
i'm
sorry,
that's
the
incumbent
--
had
said
that
they
may
plug
into
the
surge
protector,
then
the
big
orange
extension
cord
is
just
an
entrance
facility.
but
if
you
had
said
they
must
plug
into
the
big
orange
extension
cord,
then
the
big
orange
extension
cord
becomes
the
interconnection
facility;
and
consequently
the
parkgoers,
the
competitors,
may
plug
into
it.
the
problem
with
this
is
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong
in
that
the
incumbent
doesn't
get
to
choose
where
the
point
of
connection
is.
the
statute
and
the
regulations
and
the
fcc
make
clear
it's
the
competitor
that
gets
to
choose.
so
if
the
competitor
chooses
the
end
of
the
extension
cord
where
it
connects
to
the
clec
network
in
the
park,
then
even
the
sixth
circuit
agrees
with
us
and
the
seventh,
eighth
and
ninth
circuits
that
the
entrance
facility
is
the
interconnection
facility.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
justice
kennedy,
the
answer
is
yes.
the
statute
gives
the
competitive
carrier
the
opportunity
to
choose
the
point
and
the
method,
all
at
telric
rates.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
justice
ginsburg,
the
statute
and
the
regulations
make
clear
that
it
must
be
technically
feasible,
but
there's
an
almost
irrebuttable
presumption
that
when
there
are
already
facilities
in
place
performing
that
function,
that
is
technically
feasible.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
three
responses
to
that
argument,
your
honor.
first,
this
case
is
about
existing
facilities,
not
about
facilities
to
be
built,
although
there's
a
lot
of
talk
about
that.
this
isn't
a
head-on
challenge
to
the
statute
or
the
regulations.
the
procedural
posture
is
that
this
was
at&t
trying
to
get
out
of
arbitration
agreements
that
it
had
for
existing
entrance
facilities,
and
so
that's
the
posture
of
our
case.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right;
and
--
and
two
additional
points,
your
honor,
on
that.
first
they
say
this
is
a
large
obligation
because
we're
talking
about
miles
and
miles.
that
is
not
the
position
that
at&t
took
with
the
fcc
when
they
were
commenting
on
the
trro.
at
page
16a
of
the
michigan
blue
brief
in
footnote
357
of
the
trro
the
fcc
acknowledges
at&t's
statement
that
entrance
facilities
involve
very
short
distances.
in
addition,
we
have
the
fcc's
regulation
and
the
local
competition
order,
paragraph
553--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes?
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
i
believe
that's
correct,
yes.
they
are
very
short
distances.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
not
necessarily.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
because
the
fcc
has
promulgated
in
--
in
521,
the
meet-point
obligation,
which
is
another
way
that
you
can
have
interconnection.
and
that
demonstrates
two
things.
first,
that
sometimes
at&t
as
the
incumbent
is
required
to
build
out
facilities,
that
it's
not
just
a
passive
obligation.
but
in
addition,
when
they're
talking
about
meet
points,
they
say
that
it's
up
to
state
commissions
to
decide
the
appropriate
and
reasonable
distance.
so
even
if
we
were
presented
with
the
case
--
not
this
case,
but
a
different
case
--
where
you're
talking
about
what's
the
appropriate
length
of
the
facilities,
the
fcc
has
already
acknowledged
there
could
be
some
reasonable
limits
on
that.
and
the
most
important
fundamental
point,
the
fourth
point
on
this,
is
that
congress
already
in
(c)(2)
said
you're
going
to
have
interconnection
without
regard
to
market
impairment,
and
so
we're
not
going
to
look
at
the
availability
of
other
entrance
facilities
in
the
market.
if
a
competitor
asks
to
have
this
location
and
this
method
and
it's
technically
feasible,
they
do
get
the
telric
rates.
and
the
competitive
carriers
would
take
issue
with
the
presumption
that
telric
rates
are
--
are
unfair.
the
regulations
do
contemplate
that
they're
going
to
recover
not
only
their
cost
but
a
reasonable
profit.
and
we
can
disagree
about
the
congressional
wisdom
of
requiring
rates
like
that,
but
in
the
verizon
case
this
court
definitively
put
to
bed
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
telric
rates.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
justice
breyer,
if
you
look
at
paragraph
553
of
the
local
competition
order,
which
appears
at
page
27a
of
the
michigan
blue
brief--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--at
least
that's
where
it
begins.
if
you
flip
over
to
--
to
page
28a,
this
is
the
second
page
of
the
paragraph.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
very
good.
about
halfway
down
the
--
that
paragraph
there,
it
says:
"regarding
the
distance
from
an
incumbent
lec's
premises
that
an
incumbent
should
be
required
to
build
out
facilities
for
meet-point
arrangements.
"
--so
again
this
is
in
the
meet-point
context
--
"we
believe
that
the
parties
and
state
commissions
are
in
a
better
position
than
the
commission
to
determine
the
appropriate
distance
that
would
constitute
the
required
reasonable
accommodation
for
interconnection.
"
mr.
john
j.
bursch
exactly.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
exactly.
the
fcc
is
speaking,
so--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
here,
the
state
commission
didn't
say
anything,
because
we're
talking
about
existing
facilities.
there's
no
one
requesting
a
new
entrance
facility
to
be
built,
for
example,
from
lansing
to
detroit.
that's
not
this
case.
this
case
is
about
the
existing
facilities.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
do.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
regulation
51.5
defines
"interconnection"
as
the
mutual
--
or,
i'm
sorry
--
as
the
linking
of
two
networks
for
the
mutual
exchange
of
traffic.
there
is
no
dispute
that
an
entrance
facility
physically
links
a
competitive
network
with
an
incumbent
network;
thus,
when
that
entrance
facility
is
used
for
the
mutual
exchange
of
traffic,
it
is
providing
interconnection.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
fcc
has
concluded.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
it
has
to
be
part
of
their
network.
but
in
the
trro,
the
fcc
made
clear
repeatedly
that
entrance
facilities
constructed
by
incumbents
are
part
of
their
network,
and
so
there's
really
no
dispute
that
it
can
be
part
of
the
network.
and
so--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--it
is
transport.
by
definition,
interconnection
has
to
include
transport,
because
it
involves
the
mutual
exchange
of
traffic
from
one
to
another.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
we
address
that
point
at
length
in
our
reply
brief,
because
at&t
advances
that
argument,
and
it's
really
a
fundamental
misconception
or
misunderstanding
of
the
regulation.
51.5--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes.
well,
the
entrance
facilities
do
include
transport.
all
interconnection
facilities--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--right.
what
51.5
--
i
assume
that's
what
you're
looking
at?
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that
--
that
goes
to
a
term
of
art
or
a
phrase
of
art,
"transport
and
termination
of
traffic".
and
as
the
fcc
made
clear
in
its
regulation
51.701,
which
is
at
page
35a
of
the
red
brief,
what
they're
really
distinguishing
there
are
the
two
types
of
charges.
you
have
251(c)(2)
interconnection
charges
and
you
have
251(b)(5),
transport
and
termination
of
traffic
charges.
and
those
are
two
separate
concepts.
the
interconnection
charge
runs
from
the
competitive
network
to
the
incumbent
network.
the
transport
and
termination
of
traffic
charge
runs
from
the
point
of
interconnection
to
the
incumbent's
end
customer,
and
that's
very
clear.
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
acknowledged
that
point
in
note
16
of
the
pacific
bell
case.
but
common
sense
tells
you
that
has
to
be
right,
because
under
at&t's
view,
the
way
they
interpret
51.5,
there
would
be
no
interconnection
obligation,
because
there's
always
going
to
be
transport
and
mutual
exchange
of
traffic
when
interconnection
is
involved.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no,
there
is
not,
and
we
don't
take
that
position.
the
mutual
exchange
is
when
a
competitive
customer
talks
to
an
incumbent
customer
or
vice
versa.
everything
else
we
can
call
backhauling
and
that's
not
what's
at
issue
when
we're
talking
about
251(c)(2).
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
are
you
talking
about
the
distance,
or
what
bells
and
whistles--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
as
far
as--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--no,
not
at
all,
justice
breyer.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
think
it's
a
very
good
question.
and
really--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--i'll
take
it
in
two
parts.
you
know,
again,
with
respect
to
distance,
in
the
meet
point
context,
the
fcc
has
already
delegated
in
lco
paragraph
553
appropriate
and
reasonable
distances.
with
respect
to
the
bells
and
whistles,
it's
really
not
that
complicated.
you
have
got
a
cable;
that's
your
entrance
facility,
typically
a
fiberoptic
cable,
and
there's
going
to
be
a
conduit
that
it
needs
to
run
through.
there
might
be,
you
know,
risers
or
spacers
with
little
twisty
ties
or
something
similar
to
that,
zip
cords,
that
will
allow
the
cable
to
be
run
into
a
building
and
up
a
wall
and
connect
into
the
appropriate
place.
but
to
the
extent
those
are
interconnection
facilities,
those
are
necessarily
part
of
the
251(c)(2)
obligation.
and
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
your
honors,
everything
you
heard
in
the
last
30
minutes
is
premised
on
the
idea
that
the
fcc
is
doing
something
new,
and
that
there
was
never
a
promulgated
regulation.
that
is
demonstrably
false.
if
you
turn
with
me
to
page
32a
of
the
red
brief,
this
is
the
fcc's
regulation
promulgated
all
the
way
back
in
1996,
which
defined
the
scope
of
the
(c)(2)
interconnection
obligation.
it's
47
cfr
51.321,
and
this
goes
directly
to
the
points
that
justice
sotomayor
was
making.
on
page
32a,
the
fcc
says
that
an
incumbent
must
provide
interconnection
at
a
particular
point
upon
a
request
by
a
telecommunications
carrier,
such
as
a
competitor.
technically
feasible
methods
--
this
is
in
sub
b
--
include
but
are
not
limited
to,
and
they
give
two
examples:
colocation
and
meet
points.
but
this
isn't
the
be-all-end-all
of
interconnection
obligations.
these
are
exemplary.
take
an
analogy.
assume
you
had
a
high
school
cafeteria
and
the
school
board
said
you
have
to
provide
vegetables
to
students
when
they
ask
for
them,
and
you
have
to
give
them
the
vegetable
that
they
ask
for.
those
include
broccoli
and
green
beans,
and
they
don't
say
anything
else.
then
you
have
a
separate
obligation
in
(c)(3)
and
the
school
board
says
until
we
see
that
the
kids
have
enough
nutrition,
you
must
give
them
peas,
that's
entrance
facilities
unbundled
under
(c)(3).
so
some
time
goes
by
and
the
school
board
says,
okay,
the
kids
are
getting
enough
peas,
we're
going
to
wipe
away
that
second
restriction,
but
the
initial
restriction,
the
obligation
in
321
is
still
there;
and
if
a
student
asks
for
peas,
it's
within
the
scope
of
321
because
broccolis
and
green
beans
were
representative
examples,
and
peas
are
another
one.
and--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--the
premise
--
no,
that's
incorrect,
your
honor,
because
if
you
have
an
entrance
facility
under
(c)(3),
you
can
use
it
for
more
things
than
you
can
under
(c)(2),
because
under
(c)(3)
you
can
have
it
for
backhauling
and
still
get
telric
rates.
under
(c)(2)
you're
limited
to
interconnection.
so
it's
a
different
question.
but
the
idea
that
somehow
the
fcc--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--backhauling
is
a
big
deal
to
competitors.
and
so
to
say
that
they
did
something
new
in
the
trro
is
wrong.
and
to
prove
that
point
if
you
look
at
the
comments--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--the
backhauling--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--from
the
tro
and
the
trro,
and
the
fcc
discussed
that
distinction
in
the
sixth
circuit
briefing
at
pages
6
to
7,
so
this
isn't
anything
new,
either.
so
the
fact
that
this
is
not
something
new
is
demonstrated
conclusively
by
comments
in
the
trro
proceedings
from
bell
south
which
is
now
an
at&t
subsidiary.
and
bell
south
says
at
page
59
of
its
comments,
fully
recognizing
the
obligation
that
went
all
the
way
back
to
1996
in
reg
321:
because
entrance
facilities
may
be
required
for
interconnection
purposes
and
congress
explicitly
enacted
provisions
that
govern
carrier
obligations
to
provide
interconnection
in
251(c)(2),
it
was
altogether
reasonable
for
the
commission
to
exclude
these
network
elements
from
a
definition
of
ilec
dedicated
transport
intended
for
unbundled
access
under
251(c)(3).
so
even
incumbent
carriers
knew
what
the
fcc
was
doing
in
paragraph
140
of
the
trro
and
there
was
nothing
new
there.
one
other
small
point
with
respect
to
the
network
engineers
map.
this
entrance
facility
right
here
on
page
19
already
exists.
we're
talking
about
existing
facilities;
and
it's
true,
as
the
sixth
circuit
said,
that
if
the
point
of
interconnection
is
here
at
the
ilec
switch,
then
that's
where
interconnection
takes
place,
and
this
entrance
facility
is
--
is
truly
providing
transport,
not
interconnection.
but
when
a
competitive
carrier
chooses
its
own
switch
as
the
point
of
interconnection,
this
is
the
end
of
the
at&t
entrance
facility,
then
interconnection
takes
place
there,
and
even
in
the
sixth
circuit's
view
that
entrance
facility
is
interconnection
under
(c)(2),
and
as
congress
has
said,
that's
the
obligation
that
is
immutable
because
it
is
so
important,
fundamental
to
competition.
