justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
get
--
you
get
(c)(2)
at
telric
rates?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
--
you
want
the
incumbent
here
to
--
to
build
the
--
the
orange
cord
and
extend
it
to
wherever
you
have
your
switching
equipment.
and
what
they
say
is
no;
you
--
you
bring
your
switching
equipment
here;
we'll
--
we'll
allow
you
to
connect
at,
you
know,
the
end
of
our
facilities;
but
by
god,
you
--
you
make
--
you
make
your
own
connection
to
--
to
the
switches.
now
--
now,
moreover,
you're
--
you're
making
them
--
you'll
pay
them
for
the
orange
cord,
but
only
at
telric
rates,
which
are
not
realistic.
now,
why
--
why
are
they
wrong
and
you're
right,
especially
when
you
have
legislation,
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
encourage
the
independent
building
of
new
facilities?
i
mean,
it's
clear
that
the
act
wanted
these
new
entrants
where
--
where
possible
to
build
new
facilities,
and
not
simply
to
glom
on
to
the
extant
facilities
of
the
incumbents.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
logic
of
your
case
as
you
described
it
would
also
require
at&t
to
build
out
the
orange
cord.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
extant
entrance
facilities
i
assume
they
were
referring
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
right.
but
if
you
ask
for
a
longer
distance
they
would
presumably
have
to
build
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
charge
you
telric
rates.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bursch,
the
--
the
key
to
your
case
is
--
is
that
an
entrance
facility
is
interconnection,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
equate
those
two
--
those
two
terms.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
rely
upon
to
equate
them?
because
the
--
as
i
read
the
regulations,
they
--
they
use
them
as
separate
terms.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
interconnection
--
doesn't
it
have
to
be
part
of
the
internal
system
of
the
incumbent
carrier?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
section
are
you
referring
to
on
page
10a?
which
one
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
do
not
need
to
provide
unbundled
access
under
(c)(3)
to
entrance
facilities,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
genus
and
--
and
the
entrance
facility
is
the
species--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
your
estimation?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
may
be
a
--
a
reason
to
give
less
weight
to
briefs
in
this
court
different
from
the
briefs
filed
with
the
court
of
appeals.
and
you've
taken
a
different
position
here
on
--
on
the
issue
of
whether,
when
backhauling
is
included,
it's
part
of
the
--
it's
--
it's
part
of
the
interconnection
facility?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
do
not
think
you
made
that
distinction
below
about,
you
know,
oh,
it
is
part
where
there
is
back
--
where
there
is
not
backhauling,
but
where
there
is
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
they
have
to
be
as
unbundled
elements?
i
thought
they
never
had
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
unbundled
elements.
that's
(c)(3).
justice
antonin
scalia
your
argument
here
is
that
only
have
to
be
made
available
under
(c)(2)?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
not
unbundled?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
certainly
encourages
us
to
throw
up
our
hands,
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
the
sixth
circuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happened
to
the
unbundling
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
was
the
unbundling
rule
abandoned?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
bottleneck?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
(c)(3).
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
that's
your
point,
i
thought.
i
thought
it
is
precisely
your
point.
that
it
is
(c)(3)
rather
than
(c)(2).
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
--
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
--
i
thought
it
was
conceded
that
--
that
none
of
this
is
--
is
necessary
under
(c)(3).
i
thought
that's
what
the
eighth
circuit
said
and
which
is
why
they
eliminated
the
unbundling
obligation
under
(c)(3).
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
is
accepted
by
both
sides,
i
think,
that
this
is
not
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
that
it
has
to
be
needed
to
interconnect?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
whole
problem
here
is
it
doesn't
have
to
be
needed
to
interconnect.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
needed
under
(c)(3),
but
under
(c)(2)
it's
--
it's
up
to
the
--
to
the
new
company
to
say
i
want
to
interconnect
here;
and
--
and
the
incumbent
cannot
say,
oh,
no,
you
--
you
don't
have
interconnect
here;
you
can
interconnect
somewhere
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
like,
orange
wires
and
such?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
black?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
used
to
say
the
other.
you
contend
it
used
to
say
the
other,
and
it
has
never,
by
proper
means,
gainsaid
its
prior
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
they
said,
moreover,
that
they
were
not
amending
(c)(2),
specifically.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
would
have
been
unnecessary
in
the
revision
of
the
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
commission
didn't
like
the
eighth
circuit's
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
it
that
happily,
it
really
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
they
fight
the
eighth
circuit
litigation?
why
did
--
i
mean,
it
--
you're
telling
me
it
made
no
difference
whether
(c)(3)
allowed
them
to
do
what
they
wanted
to
do
and
what
the
eighth
circuit
said
they
couldn't
do,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
very
slightly
different.
that's
not
that
big
a
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
incidentally,
where
do
you
--
where
do
you
get
that
backhauling
restriction
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
yes.
the--
