mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
agency
is
trying
to
use
an
amicus
brief
to
interpret
a
few
sentences
in
orders
from
years
ago
to
create
a
new
legal
rule
without
ever
going
through
a
process
that
would
result
in
judicial
review.
in
fact,
in
the
triennial
review
orders,
where
the
agency
supposedly
announced
this
new
obligation,
it
assured
incumbents
like
at&t
that
it
was
not
altering
its
interpretation
of
the
statutory
interconnection
duty.
and
the
government
correctly
concedes
here
that
before
those
orders,
the
government
had
never
interpreted
the
statutory
interconnection
duty
to
require
companies
like
at&t
to
sell
a
fiber
optic
cable
at
telric
rates.
yes--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--well,
your
honor,
i
actually
read
their
brief
differently,
and
i
note
that
in
the
sixth
circuit
they
didn't
rely
on
any
regulations
at
all.
the
argument
was
entirely
based
on
paragraph
140.
but
going
to
the
regulations,
at
the
same
time
they
promulgated
those
rules,
the
government
did
define
interconnection
to
exclude
transport,
and
when
they
defended
that
exclusion--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--there
are--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--your
honor,
when
the
fcc
explained
this
to
the
eighth
circuit,
what
it
said
is
there
are
really
three
things
going
on.
one
is
(c)(2),
is
the
duty
to
interconnect
at
a
point,
not
to
provide
a
whole
host
of
facilities
that
get
you
to
the
point,
but
literally
the
duty
to
interconnect
at
a
specific
point
in
the
world;
selected
by
the
competitor
to
be
sure,
but
that
only
tells
you
where
interconnection
occurs.
that's
the
point.
the
commission
then
said:
okay,
then
there
are
other
obligations
in
the
statute.
one
of
them
is
in
section
251(b)(5),
and
that's
what
obligates
the
incumbent
to
accept
telephone
calls
that
are
sent
to
that
point
and
to
send
telephone
calls
through
that
point
to
the
competitor.
and
then
there's
the
third
thing,
and
this
is
directly
from
the
government's
brief
to
the
eighth
circuit,
where
they
explain
that
section
(c)(2)--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--the
eighth
circuit.
we
cite
this
at
--
from
1996,
this
is
the
contemporaneous
view
of
the
agency
at
the
time
it
promulgated
the
interconnection
regulations.
it's
defending
those
regulations
against
a
challenge
that
they
are
too
narrow.
and
what
the
agency
says
to
the
eighth
circuit,
which
then
deferred
to
this
interpretation,
is
with
section
(c)(2)
interconnection
included
routing
and
transmission.
(c)(2)
would
overlap
with
other
sections
that,
one,
describe
a
duty
to
route
and
transmit
traffic,
telephone
calls;
and,
two,
a
duty
to
lease
facilities
that
will
be
used
for
routing
and
transmission.
footnote:
those
duties
are
(b)(5)
and
(c)(3).
to
the
extent
there
is
a
duty
to
lease
the
facilities,
the
fiber
optic
cables
that
competitors
are
going
to
use
to
get
to
the
interconnection
point
of
their
choice,
that
duty
has
to
arise,
the
commission
is
saying
here,
only
under
section
251(c)(3).
and
we
know
it
doesn't
arise
under
that
section
because
these
aren't
things
that
are
bottleneck
elements,
these
aren't
things
that
competitors
can't
get
themselves.
competitors
are
interconnecting
today.
wireless
carriers,
other
competitors,
everyone
in
the
state
of
ohio
has
since
2005
not
been
paying
telric
rates,
and
as
the
amicus
brief
showed,
there
has
been
no
detriment
to
competition.
interconnection
is
occurring.
and
so
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
here
is
impose
this
leasing
obligation
under
the
interconnection
duty
in
a
way
that
never
gave
at&t
and
other
incumbents
any
opportunity
to
challenge
it.
they
never
explain
how
it
squares
with
the
text
and
structure
of
the
statute,
with
their
prior
statements,
or
why
there's
any
policy
basis
for
interpreting
what
they
claim
is
an
ambiguous
statute
to
require
telric
pricing
for
things
that
are
not
bottleneck
elements.
back
in
the
level
competition
order,
justice
sotomayor,
when
they
adopted
the
telric
methodology,
they
recognized
--
this
is
in
paragraph
702
--
interconnection
services
--
that's
what
they
called
it
back
then
--
are
bottlenecks,
not
things
that
competitors
can
build
themselves
or
buy
from
third
parties
in
the
marketplace,
as
the
agency
has
found
is
the
case
since
2005.
they
never--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--i
understand
this,
your
honor.
but
if
the
agency
had
ever
done
that
through
notice
and
comment
with
a
rule
and
published
it
in
the
federal
register
--
which
they
concede
that
before
2003
they
hadn't
done
that
as
to
entrance
facilities
--
and
they
claimed
they
had
no
occasion
to
address
the
question
--
and
then
in
2003
we
get
a
single
sentence
in
a
paragraph
of
an
order
where
there
was
no
notice
they
were
considering
interconnection
duties,
no
publication
of
a
new
regulation,
no
publication
--
nothing
that
would
have,
you
know,
told
at&t
and
other
incumbents
you
should
seek
judicial
review
of
this
if
you
think
it's
wrong.
and
now
we're
being
told
8
years
later
that
when
they
said
facilities
in
that
paragraph,
they
meant
entrance
facilities.
and
we're
being
told
2
years
later
when
they
said
interconnection
facilities
that
they
meant
entrance
facilities,
even
though
when
they
were
asked
that
question
by
the
sixth
circuit
they
said
we
didn't
define
that
term.
and
mr.
miller
might
want
to
say
they've
just
said
a
little
bit
more
now,
but
they've
said
something
radically
different.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
prior
to
2003
and
2005,
when
there
was
an
unbundling
rule
in
place
--
and
the
commission
had
always
recognized
when
it
established
that
unbundling
rule
in
1996
that
competitors
would
use
unbundled
transport
facilities
to
connect
to
incumbent
switches,
so
to
connect
to
those
interconnection
points.
and
sure,
prior
to
2005
when
the
unbundling
rule
was
in
place,
competitors
would
lease
these
facilities
and
pay
telric
rates
and
use
them
to
get
to
the
interconnection
point;
but
there
was
never
during
that
time
any
statement
that
even
if
there
was
no
impairment,
section
251(c)(2)
would
require
the
exact
same
thing
to
get
to
the
interconnection
point.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
it
got
--
it
was
gotten
rid
of.
it
doesn't
exist
any
more.
so
now
at&t
has
said
those
things
you
used
to
buy
under
the
unbundling
rule,
we
don't
have
to
sell
them
to
you
at
telric
rates
anymore.
we
have
a
tariff.
we've
always
had
a
tariff.
we'll
sell
them
to
you
at
just
and
reasonable
rates
under
the
tariff.
you
can
build
them
yourself,
as
competitors
and
wireless
carriers
are
doing.
you
can
buy
them
from
the
third
parties
that
build
them
and
advertise
their
offering
of
them.
but
what
you
can't
do
is
say
all
of
a
sudden
that
the
interconnection
duty
had
always
required
the
exact
same
thing
as
the
unbundling
duty,
at
least
not
without
going
through
a
rulemaking
where
you
lay
out
your
policy
grounds.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
it
was
abandoned
because
the
record
evidence
showed
unambiguously
that
competitors
don't
need
these
things
from
incumbents.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
it's
not
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
a
bottleneck.
and
i
guess
that
gets
to
the
second
point
i'd
make,
which
is
that
again
--
and
i
don't
think
they
rely
on
the
regulations,
justice
sotomayor,
and
they've
never
--
and
the
government
concedes
in
footnote
6
that
the
regulations
themselves
don't
get
them
to
where
they
want
to
go.
they
need
these
statements
they
made
in
2003
and
2005.
and
even
if
you
credit
their
new
position
that
when
they
said
facilities
and
interconnection
facilities,
that
was
just
an
imprecise
way
of
saying
entrance
facilities,
those
statements
don't
get
you
to
the
rule
that
they're
endorsing.
what
the
agency
actually
said
is
that
competitors
will
have
access
to
these
facilities
--
and
let's
pretend
that
means
entrance
facilities
for
the
time
being
--
will
have
access
to
entrance
facilities
at
cost-based
rates
to
the
extent
that
they
require
them
to
interconnect,
and
that's
paragraph
140
of
the
triennial
review
order
and
the
remand
order,
and
they
said
the
same
thing,
although
they
used
the
word
"need",
not
"require".
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
well,
i
think
the
point
is
what
they
--
this
is
why
we
think
the
right
reading
of
those
statements
is
that
the
facilities
they're
referring
to
are
things
they
actually
do
require
and
need,
which
are
the
things
inside
at&t
buildings
that
they
can't
replicate,
that
it's
strange
for
them
to
have
said
"you're
going
to
get
these
facilities
you
require.
"
but
to
have
meant
something
that
they
don't
in
fact
require.
but
even
if
you
want
to
read,
again,
facilities
and
interconnection
facilities
to
mean
entrance
facilities,
they
rule
they're
endorsing,
and
you
know,
michigan
now
wants,
if
it's
in
the
ground
we
have
to
provide
it;
if
we
have
to
build
it,
we
don't
have
to
provide
it;
it's
the
first
time
we've
heard
of
that
in
the
scope
of
this
litigation.
the
government
seems
to
only
be
willing
to
--
to
talk
about
those
few
facilities
that
had
been
gotten
under
the
old,
now
gone
unbundling
rules;
but
that's
not
the
distinction
that
the
commission
drew
when
it
said
this
thing
that
supposedly's
imposing
an
obligation
on
at&t
and
other
companies.
it
limited
it
to
those
things
that
competitors
require.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
but
that's
what--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--well,
it
imposes
an
obligation,
your
honor,
to
provide
interconnection
at
a
point
--
it's
at
a
point
within
our
network.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
well
that's
--
my
point
is,
yes;
if
there
is
a
facilities
leasing
obligation
it
has
to
exist
under
(c)(3),
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
scalia.
that
we
think
that's
the
right
reading
of
the
statute,
we
think
that's
what
the
fcc
told
the
eighth
circuit,
we
think
it's
what
the
fcc
said
in
the
local
competition
order.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
your
honor--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--there
--
there
is
really
no--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--no.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
well,
the
michigan
commission
decided
that
the
fcc
in
that
paragraph
140
created
this
obligation.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
that's
wrong.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
that's
--
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
that's
right,
and
because
it's
not
necessary,
you
can't
read,
as
the
government
tries
to,
belatedly,
years
after
the
fact,
those
statements
in
their
orders
from
2003
and
2005,
those
few
statements
in
these--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--but--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--we
don't--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--because
the
brief
here
doesn't
do
what
a
decision
on
a
primary
jurisdiction
referral
would
do,
which
is
square
what
the
agency
is
doing
with
the
text
and
structure
of
the
statute
with
prior
statements
that
contradict--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--your
honor--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--our--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--that
--
your
honor,
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
scalia.
they
get
to
pick
a
point.
the
point
has
to
be
within
our
network.
rule
51.305
identifies
a
series
of
illustrative
points
all
of
which
exist
inside
at&t
buildings,
and
that's
what
they've
done.
they've
picked
a
point--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--we
do
disagree.
i
mean,
at
the
time
of
the
triennial
review
order,
they
said
it
was
outside
of
our
network.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
and
that's
when
they
also
supposedly
adopted
this
rule.
so
somehow,
this
rule
they've
adopted
has
to
coexist
with
the
notion
that
these
things
are
outside
our
network.
but
in
or
out,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
they're
not
claiming--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--pardon
me.
i
think
--
if
you
have
the
network
engineer's
brief,
figure
4
on
page
19,
i
think
it
does
a
very
good
job
of
illustrating
what
it
is
we're
talking
about.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
they
draw
them
in
black,
but
yes.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
figure
4
on
page
19.
what
the
competitors
in
this
case
in
michigan
have
long
said
is
that
the
competitor
has
picked
as
its
point
of
interconnection
the
point
inside
the
box
on
the
right
labeled
incumbent
local
exchange
carrier's
central
office,
and
then
they
need
some
fiberoptic
cable
to
bridge
the
gap
to
that
interconnection
point.
that's
how
judge
sutton
understood
it
in
dissent.
that's
how
judge
batchelder
understood
it
in
the
majority.
and
all
the
interconnection
duty
talks
about,
all
any
of
the
interconnection
regulations
talk
about,
is
letting
the
competitors
pick
that
point.
how
they
get
to
the
point
is
up
to
them.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
right.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
your
honor,
there's
more
language
that
i
think
forecloses
those
interpretations.
it's
not
just
a
duty
to
provide
interconnection.
it's
a
duty
to
provide
interconnection
for
the
competitor's
facilities
and
equipment
at
a
point
within
the
incumbent's
network.
nothing
in
that
statutory
language
says
that
the
duty
is
to
provide
the
competitor
with
the
facilities--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--and
justice
breyer,
you
might
have
an
agency
that
did
that.
we
don't
have
an
agency
that
did
that.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
and
that
means
that
michigan
was
wrong
when
it
thought
that
the
agency
had
said
it,
and
the
sixth
circuit
was
right
when
it--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--that's
correct.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
well,
justice
breyer,
again,
we
point
you
to
their
definition
of
interconnection
where
they
excluded
transport
from
interconnection
and
explained
to
the
eighth
circuit's--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--what
they
said
is--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--what
they
--
i
--
your
honor,
i
just
--
i
don't
think
you're
describing
it
in
a
way
that
consists
--
comports
with
the
language
of
the
act.
what
they
said
is
a
duty
to
lease
facilities
that
will
be
used
for
routing
and
transmission
of
telephone
calls
to
the
point.
that's
(c)(3).
that's
not
part
of
the
interconnection
duty.
when
they
contrasted,
in
their
local
competition
order,
paragraph
172,
they
said
what
interconnection
does
is
it
lets
the
competitor
pick
the
place
where
they're
going
to
drop
the
traffic
off.
but
it
is
section
(c)(3)
that
lets
the
competitor
say,
i
would
prefer
to
use
incumbent
facilities
at
telric
rates
to
get
to
that
point.
they
have
made
that
very
distinction.
but
what
they're
trying
to
do
through
their
amicus
brief
here
is
to
turn
(c)(2)
into
a
facilities
leasing
provision.
now,
again,
we
don't
think
this
court
needs
to
say
that
they
could
never
have
promulgated
a
rule
with
reasons
that
would
get
you
there,
but
they've
never
done
it.
if
they
had
done
it,
we
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
seek
judicial
review.
they
would
have
had
to
explain
themselves.
we've
never
had
that
opportunity.
when
they've
said
--
and
you
know,
i
think
it's
important,
when
they
put
out
these
sentences
in
the
triennial
review
order
and
triennial
review
remand
order
that
supposedly
told
us
of
this
new
obligation,
they
never
asked
for
notice
about
this,
even
though
in
their
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking,
they
said,
should
we
get
rid
of
entrance
facilities
under
(c)(3)?
they
didn't
say,
and
if
we
do,
what
would
that
mean
for
(c)(2)?
they
didn't
ask
the
question.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
that's
exactly
right.
in
the
orders
themselves,
they
assured
at&t
and
others
that
they
weren't
changing
anything.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
no,
that
is
still
used,
justice
breyer.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
but
i
point--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--well,
i
don't
think
there's
--
and
i
point
to
this
court's
decision
by
justice
ginsburg
in
northwest
airlines
v.
kent,
510
u.s.
355,
where
this
court
said:
nobody
has
asked
us
to
invoke
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction;
we're
not
going
to
do
it;
instead,
we
will
adopt
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
will
suffice
for
the
purposes
at
hand.
and
as
the
court
later
recognized
in
brand
x,
that
leaves
it
open
to
the
agency,
in
a
rulemaking,
to
actually
do
the
work
that,
as
justice
scalia
noted,
the
agency
has
never
done
here.
and
so
it's
--
rather
than
imposing
something
through
a
combination
of
amicus
briefs
and
statements
that
don't
actually
set
forth
the
rule
that
the
agency
is
trying
to
defend
here,
we
would
have
a
real
rulemaking
and
a
chance--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--that's
not
quite
right,
justice
sotomayor.
up
until
2005,
companies
like
talk
america
were
allowed
to
get
both
the
actual
physical
linking
at
telric
rates
and
the
transport
facility
at
telric
rates,
but
under
two
separate
statutory
provisions.
they
were
getting
the
transport
facility
under
(c)(3);
that's
gone
away.
they
were
getting
the
linking
under
(c)(2).
now,
there
were
other
companies
like
wireless
carriers.
they
were
getting
the
linking
at
telric
rates
under
(c)(2),
but
they
were
paying
full
freight
for
the
transport,
because
they
have
never
been
allowed
to
get
unbundled
network
elements.
so
this
notion
that
there's
going
to
be
a
price
increase
to
wireless
carriers
is
a
fiction.
but
what
--
so
competitors
were
doing
two
things
under
two
provisions.
one
of
those
has
gone
away.
and
it
was
only
after
it
was
gone
away
that
anybody
raised
this
notion
that
maybe
that
transport
facility
had
always
been
required
under
(c)(2)
also.
but
that's
nothing
the
commission
has
ever
done
in
a
rulemaking.
it
never
did
that
in
the
proper
way
in
the
triennial
review
order
or
the
triennial
review
remand
order.
as
justice
scalia
noted,
it
assured
at&t
and
other
incumbents
that
it
wasn't
changing
the
law.
when
it
published
things
in
the
federal
register,
which
is
where
it
is
supposed
to
publish
substantive
rules,
it
identified
specifically
the
elimination
of
entrance
facilities
as
unbundled
network
elements,
and
said
not
a
word
about
any
continued
duty
to
provide
them
under
section--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--but
then
the
question,
justice
sotomayor,
is:
well,
what
was
that
obligation?
and
the
government
concedes
in
footnote
6
that
prior
to
making
those
statements,
it
had
never
interpreted
that
obligation
to
include
the
duty
to
lease
that
transport
facility.
it
claims
the
question
never
came
up
because,
while
it
was
an
unbundled
element,
it
didn't
matter.
now,
i
think
it's
quite
telling
that
while
it
was
an
unbundled
element
and
we
were
having
10
years
of
litigation
about
what
the
right
standard
is
for
an
unbundled
element,
nobody
even
thought
to
say:
by
the
way,
all
of
this
litigation
is
beside
the
point
with
respect
to
the
use
of
these
facilities
when
we
attach
them
to
an
interconnection
point.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
exactly,
justice
scalia.
it's
very
strange
that
no
--
i
mean
--
and
i
think
from
the
fact
that
nobody
thought
to
say
it
comes
to
what
we
view
has
happened,
is
that
this
is
a
rear
guard
effort
to
preserve
telric
pricing
for
things
that
the
commission
has
said
should
no
longer
be
available
as
telric
--
at
telric
pricing.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
i
--
i
think
it's
probably
a
fair
statement
that
the
commission
does
not
like
the
decision
vacating
its
unbundling
rules,
but
nonetheless,
that's
what
happened,
and
the
new
rules
get
rid
of
this
element.
again,
what
the
michigan
commission
found
was
that
the
fcc
had
specifically
determined,
that
there
is
a
leasing
obligation
under
(c)(2).
that
never
happened.
the
sixth
circuit
was
right
about
that.
there
is
no
leasing
obligation
that
the
commission
has
ever
established.
i
think,
justice
breyer,
to
go
back
to
your
question,
whether
they
could
do
it
is
a
separate
question.
i
don't
think
they
could.
i
think
we
have
an
incredibly
good
chance
to
prevail
if
they
were
to
ever
promulgate
such
a
rule,
but
they
never
did
it.
they
said
things
directly
to
the
contrary.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
right.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
right,
they
care.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
that's
exactly
right.
and
if
the
commission
had
actually--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--i'm
glad
--
i'm
glad
we're
at
least
agreeing
with
each
other,
justice
breyer.
but
--
and
i
think
that
really
is
the
key
administrative
law
point
here,
is
that
if
the
agency
in
the
triennial
review
order
or
triennial
review
remand
order
had
actually
said
what
they
say
in
their
brief,
we
never
had
occasion
to
consider
this
question
before.
now
we're
considering
it,
and
here
is
why
we
think
it's
appropriate
to
read
(c)(2)
to
impose
these.
and
despite
the
fact
that,
you
know
--
again,
sufficient
claims
of
the
statute's
ambiguous.
they
need
a
policy
reason
why
it's
appropriate
to
read
this
ambiguous
statute
to
require
telric
pricing
for
things
that
third
parties
are
actually
investing
in
and
selling
at
marketplace
rates,
why
it's
appropriate
to
undercut
those
third
party
business
models
with
this
telric
pricing
for
something
the
competitors
are
can
and
are
building
themselves,
third
parties
are
selling--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--with
due
respect,
justice
sotomayor,
i
don't
think
they've
made
that
policy
claim
here,
and
in
particular
this
is
not
a
case
about
whether
interconnection
is
going
to
occur.
competitors
and
wireless
carriers
are
picking
their
points
of
interconnection.
they
are
interconnecting
today.
they
have
been
doing
it.
wireless
carriers
never
had
telric
priced
transport
facilities,
and
yet
they're
interconnected.
competitors
in
nearly
a
dozen
states
that
have
addressed
this
issue
and
disagreed
with
michigan
and
agreed
with
the
sixth
circuit
are
interconnecting
today
using
their
own
facilities,
using
third-party
facilities.
and
when
they
come
to
at&t
and
say
we
would
like
to
plug
our
facility
into
this
point,
at&t
says,
absolutely,
and
does
the
work
necessary
to
get
those
two
things
connected.
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
you're
right.
it
certainly--
mr.
scott
h.
angstreich
--it's
--
it's
an
imposition
on
at&t.
but
the
notion
that
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
the
price
of
cable
will
alter
the
interconnection
of
telephone
networks
is
simply
false.
yes,
interconnection
is
an
important
policy,
and
congress
said
we
have
to
provide
it
at
points
within
our
networks
selected
by
competitors
and
we
do
that.
but
congress
didn't
say
and
the
fcc
has
never
said
that
we
also
have
to
provide
them
whatever
it
is
that
they
want
to
use
to
get
to
that
point.
and
there
really
is,
and
i
think
some
of
the
questioning
pulled
that
out,
though
they
want
to
say
i
think
because
the
government
won't
endorse
the
absolute
position,
the
petitioners
were
taking
in
their
opening
briefs,
that
this
is
only
about
things
that
used
to
be
ordered
as
unbundled
elements
or
things
already
in
the
ground.
but
their
position,
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
has
no
stopping
point.
it
would
cover
anything
a
competitor
might
ever
want
to
use
to
get
telephone
calls
to
the
interconnection
point.
and
they've
never
defended
that
limitless
reading.
and
if
the
agency
ever
wanted
to
adopt
it
would
challenge
it,
and
as
i've
said,
i
like
our
chances,
but
until
they
do
it,
michigan
was
wrong
to
conclude
that
the
commission
had
done
it
and
the
sixth
circuit
was
correct
to
reject
that
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
sit
down.
