justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
underlying
that
question
is
an
issue
that
i
think
justices
ginsburg
and
scalia
were
asking.
technically
feasible
is
different
from
economically
ridiculous
or
economically
burdensome.
how
does
that,
"economically
burdensome"
--
does
it
get
considered
by
anyone
so
that
--
because
one
could
imagine,
as
justice
breyer
said,
that
a
competitor
could
come
in
and
say,
now
build
me
the
taj
mahal
as
an
entrance
facility
or
as
an
interconnection
facility.
so
is
there
anyone
controlling
for
that
latter
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
know
you're
saying
that,
but
everybody's
arguing
about
what
the
tro
and
the
trro
say
or
don't
say.
but
i
go
behind
that
and
i
go
--
i
think
the
government's
entire
argument
is
not
based
even
on
those.
it's
based
on
the
lco
regulations
themselves.
they've
cited
two,
which
is
51.305
and
51.321.
they're
not
relying
on
those
tros
in
their
back
and
forth
there,
they
are
relying
on
the
regulation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
you
address
their
point
that
there
are
two
different
charges
at
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
one
--
that
interconnection
by
definition
includes
transport.
it's
hard
for
me
to
think
of
how
it
doesn't,
because
they've
got
to
travel
from
one
place
to
another,
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--now
you're
reading
limitation
into
the
statute.
all
the
statute
says
is,
you're
obligated
to
provide
interconnection
services.
it
doesn't
say
how
or
limit
it
only
to
things
that
are
not
bottlenecks
or
things
that
are
bottlenecks.
it
just
says
you're
obligated
to
do
x,
and
that's
what
the
agency's
saying.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
that
regard,
in
all
of
these
years,
are
--
you
mean
to
tell
me
there
is
no
other
incumbent
that
has
provided
interconnection
services
at
an
entrance
facility
and
charged
telric
rates?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
--
that's
(c)(3).
justice
sonia
sotomayor
(c)(2)
says
you
just
--
you
have
to.
it
imposes
an
affirmative
obligation
to
provide
interconnection
and
--
interconnection.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
wait
a
minute.
does
--
don't
the
regulations
now
and
the
commission's
tro,
et
cetera,
say
that
an
entrance
facility
is
within
your
network?
you
haven't
challenged
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
now--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
they're
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--figure
4.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
guess
the
problem
i'm
having
is
that
you
tell
me
on
the
one
hand
that
up
until,
what,
2005,
you
were
always
paying
the
cost
plus
profit
rates,
the
telric's
rates,
for
interconnection
at
a
--
at
an
entrance
facility.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
it
did
in
the
footnotes.
it
said
--
that's
what
the
whole
dispute
is
about,
which
is,
we're
not
changing
the
obligation
to
provide
interconnection
services.
so
it
said
it
clearly.
its
view--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--accepting
their
policy
arguments,
what
does
that
do
to
your
main
argument?
because
i
think
they've
explained
it
to
my
satisfaction
why
this
is
necessary
because
(c)(2)
requires
interconnection.
congress
has
made
a
judgment
that
interconnection
is
the
mainstay
of
competition
in
this
area,
so
if
i
accept
that--
