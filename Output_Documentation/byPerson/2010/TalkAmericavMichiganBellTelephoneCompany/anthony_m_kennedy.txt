i
have
just
one
small
question
on
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
there
are
two
competitors
and
each
of
them
wants
to
connect,
but
each
of
them
wants
to
connect
at
a
different
point
and
in
a
different
way.
must
the
incumbent
accommodate
both
if
they're
technically
feasible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
that
this
is
a
link,
and
your
--
the
opposition
says
that
it's
transport.
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
--
but
the
rate
says
interconnection
does
not
include
transport.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
got
it
in
front
of
me.
it
says
"this
term
does
not
include
transport.
"
but
you
say
it
does?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i'm
talking
about
interconnection.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
know
why
--
why
it's
so
hard.
i
mean,
i
got
out
my
orange
cord
and
i--
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
--
but
i
--
i
wasn't
sure
of
--
if
it
was
a
transport
or
link.
that
--
that's
my
concern.
