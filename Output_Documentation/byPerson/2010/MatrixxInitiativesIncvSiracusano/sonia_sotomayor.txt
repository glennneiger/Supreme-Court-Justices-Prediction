but
wait
a
minute.
these
weren't
psychics.
these
were
3
clinical
doctors
in
this
area,
one
of
them
you
knew
poised
to
go
to
a
society
meeting
to
make
this
allegation.
doesn't
it
make
a
difference
who
the
reports
are
coming
from
and
what
the
substance
of
those
reports
may
do
to
your
product?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
you
got
cert
granted
on
a
limited
question,
and
the
limited
question
was
whether
in
a
complaint
that
alleges
only
adverse
reports
can
you
prove
materiality
and
scienter
without
proving
statistical
importance.
that's
the
question
presented.
justice
kagan
started
with
the
point
that
the
fda
doesn't
require
that.
it
requires
just
reasonable
evidence
of
a
connection,
not
statistical.
many
of
the
amici
here
have
done
a
wonderful
job
of
explaining
why
statistical
importance
can't
be
a
measure
because
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
study
at
issue.
so
given
all
of
that
--
and
even
in
your
brief,
in
a
footnote,
you
answered
the
question
by
saying,
no,
we
can't
establish
that
rule
as
an
absolute,
because
there
are
additional
factors
that
could
prove
materiality
and
scienter.
so
you've
already
answered
the
question
presented.
are
we
down
to
what
justice
scalia
asked
you,
which
is:
we
got
a
no
to
the
question:
are
the
facts
in
this
case
enough?
i
don't
know
why
we
would
have
granted
cert
on
that,
but
you
presented
a
different
question
presented.
given
the
question
presented,
is
the
answer
no?
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
just
interrupt
a
second?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
wasn't
an
fda-approved
drug.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
weren't
any
adverse
reports
in
the
legal
sense
of
that
word.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
the
fda
sense.
so
we're
using
a
misnomer
here
to
start
with.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
continue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
was
your
--
that
long
litany
of
factors
you
mentioned
a
few
moments
ago
about
how
a
company
will
go
about
determining
whether
an
adverse
event
report
is
material
or
not
or
should
be
disclosed
or
not,
are
you
saying
that
companies
don't
have
to
respond
to
irrational
securities
holders?
are
you
accepting
your
adversary's
proposition
that
on
some
level
--
you
said
credible
evidence
--
that
they
don't
have
to
respond
to
things
they
judge
are
not
credible?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
has
that
--
the
solicitor
general's
argument.
he
wasn't
actually
even
talking
about
causation.
he
was
talking
about
a
statement
you
made
about
the
company
poised
to
double
its
growth.
and
i
think
he
was
saying
that
on
the
basis
of
what
you
had
heard
up
until
that
time,
you
had
to
have
known
that
that
statement
was
misleading,
as
was
the
statement
that
this
drug,
that
there
was
absolutely
no
proof
or
connection
of
causation,
which
was
your
scientific
panel
said
you
couldn't
make
that
extreme
statement.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
respondents,
plaintiffs
in
this
securities
fraud
class
action
alleged
that
petitioner
matrixx
initiatives,
inc.
made
statements
that
were
misleading
in
light
of
reports
that
matrixx
had
received
from
medical
professionals
about
patients
who
had
lost
their
sense
of
smell
after
using
matrixx's
leading
product,
a
zinc-based
remedy
called
“zicam
cold
remedy”.
according
to
the
complaint,
the
professionals
drew
matrixx
attention
to
studies
that
had
demonstrated
a
link
between
inter-nasal
application
of
zinc
and
loss
of
smell.
respondents
claimed
that
matrixx
made
a
series
of
public
statements
regarding
revenues
and
product
safety
during
the
class
period
that
were
misleading
in
light
of
this
information.
matrixx
argues
that
respondents
have
not
adequately
alleged
that
matrixx
made
a
material
misrepresentation
or
omission.
in
basic,
inc.
versus
levinson,
we
held
that
the
materiality
requirement
is
satisfied
when
there
is,
“a
substantial
likelihood
that
the
disclosure
of
the
omitted
fact
would've
been
viewed
by
the
reasonable
investor
as
having
significantly
altered
the
total
mix
of
information
made
available”.
matrixx
proposes
a
bright-line
rule
that
reports
of
adverse
events
associated
with
a
pharmaceutical
company's
products
cannot
be
material,
absent
a
sufficient
number
of
such
reports
to
establish
a
statistically
significant
risk
that
the
product
is
causing
the
events.
we
reject
this
rule.
medical
experts
and
the
food
and
drug
administration
rely
on
evidence
other
than
statistically
insignificant
data
establish
an
inference
of
causation.
given
that
medical
professionals
and
regulators
act
on
the
basis
of
evidence
of
causation
that
is
not
statistically
significant,
it
stands
to
reason
that
in
certain
cases
reasonable
investors
would
as
well.
assessing
the
materiality
of
adverse
event
reports
is
a
fact
specific
inquiry
that
requires
consideration
of
the
source,
content,
and
content
of
the
reports.
the
mere
existence
of
reports
of
adverse
events
will
not
be
material
information.
something
more
is
needed,
but
that
something
more
is
not
limited
to
statistical
significance
and
can
come
from
“the
source,
content,
and
context
of
the
reports.
we
conclude
that
respondents
have
adequately
pled
materiality
in
this
case.assuming
the
complaint's
allegations
to
be
true,
matrixx
received
information
that
plausibly
indicated
a
reliable
causal
link
between
its
product
and
loss
of
smell.
in
light
of
all
the
complaint's
allegations,
it
is
substantially
likely
that
a
reasonable
investor
would
have
viewed
this
information
as
having
significantly
altered
the
total
mix
of
information
made
available.
matrixx
also
argues
that
respondents
have
not
adequately
alleged
that
matrixx
acted
with
the
required
state
of
mind.
under
the
private
securities
litigation
reform
act,
a
plaintiff
must
state
with
particularity
facts
or
giving
rise
to
those
strong
inference
that
the
defendant
acted
with
the
required
state
of
mind.
we
have
explained
that
a
complaint
satisfies
the
standard
only
if
a
reasonable
person
would
deem
the
inference
of
scienter,
cogent
and
at
least
is
compelling
as
any
opposing
inference
one
could
draw
from
the
facts
alleged.
the
complaint's
allegations
give
rise
to
a
cogent
inference
that
matrixx
elected
not
to
disclose
the
reports,
not
because
it
believed
they
were
meaningless
but
because
it
understood
their
likely
harmful
effect
on
the
market.
this
inference
is
at
least
as
compelling
as
any
opposing
inference.
we
conclude
that
respondents
have
adequately
pled
that
matrixx
acted
with
the
required
state
of
mind.
for
these
reasons,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed.
the
decision
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
