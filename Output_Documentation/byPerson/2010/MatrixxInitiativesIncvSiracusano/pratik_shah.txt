mr.
pratik
a.
shah
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
35
years,
this
court's
precedents
have
instructed
that
information
is
material
for
securities
fraud
purposes
if
a
reasonable
investor
would
have
viewed
it
as
having
meaningfully
altered
the
total
mix
of
information.
under
the
terms
of
their
question
presented,
petitioners
propose
to
depart
from
that
contextual
inquiry
in
favor
of
a
categorical
rule
that
deems
information
about
an
adverse
drug
effect
immaterial
absent
statistical
significance.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
let
me
try
to
unpack
the
satanic
connection
hypotheticals
a
little
bit.
now,
to
be
sure,
if
someone
just
called
a
company
and
said,
hey,
i
think
you
guys
are
affiliated
with
satanic
practices,
surely
a
company
would
not
have
to
go
and
disclose
that
to
all
the
investors.
but
this
is
going
to
depend
on
what
the
actual
reality
is
and
what
the
company's
statements
have
been.
now,
if
the
company
has
made
a
statement
that,
look,
consumer
confidence
in
our
products
is
at
an
all-time
high
and
we
expect
sales
to
double
in
the
next
quarter,
and
yet
they
are
aware
that
there
--
a
consumer
boycott
is
being
planned
by,
let's
say,
10
percent
of
their
consumer
base
premised
on
the
irrational
notion
that
their
company
is
tied
to
satan,
then
certainly
to
correct
their
affirmative
representation
that
consumer
confidence
is
at
an
all-time
high
and
that
they
expect
their
sales
to
double,
a
reasonable
investor
would
want
to
know--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
in
that
hypothetical,
it
depends
on
what
affirmative
statements
the
companies
have
made.
under
the
securities
law
--
and
this
is
an
important
point
that
i
don't
think
has
come
through
yet.
under
the
securities
laws,
there
is
no
baseline
duty
to
disclose
for
a
manufacturer
or
a
company.
a
company
creates
a
duty
to
disclose
once
they
have
spoken.
so
it's
going
to
depend
on
what
the
company
has
said.
now,
in
your
scenario,
if
a
company
has
made
statements
projecting
their
company's
success
into
the
next
quarter,
for
example,
and
they
have
a
concrete
basis
to
know
that,
as
your
hypothetical
submits,
10
percent
of
their
computer
--
consumer
base
is
going
to
leave
the
company's
products,
that
is
almost
certainly
going
to
be
material
to
an
investor,
and
so
yes,
they
would
have
to
disclose
that
we
have
reason
to
believe,
however
ridiculous
it
is
and
untrue
it
is,
that
10
percent
of
our
consumer
base
has
decided
to
boycott
our
products.
that's
certainly
reasonable.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
it's
based
on
what
they
said.
so,
for
example,
if
the
company
had
simply
remained
silent
and
not
said
anything
about
its
future
sales,
its
prospects,
then
under
the
securities
laws
there
is
no
duty
to
disclose.
basic
and
other
cases
have
long
made
clear
that
there
has
to
be
something
to
trigger
a
duty
to
disclose.
that
is,
under
rule
10b-5
it's
only
statements
that
are
rendered
misleading
by
the
omission
of
a
material
fact
that
can
trigger
liability.
if
there
is
no
projection
about
the
company's
future
success,
then
it
wouldn't
have
to
disclose
in
that
situation.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
sure,
your
honor--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--in
certain
cases
where
there
are
very
generalized
statements,
for
example,
we
think
our
product
will
do
well,
that
may
close
--
come
close
to
the
line
of
puffery
that
is
a
nonactionable
statement
that
no
reasonable
investor
would
rely
on.
petitioners
have
never
pressed
that
argument
before
this
court.
there
is
no
dispute
about
whether
the
statements
that
matrixx
made
in
this
case
are
actionable,
even
though
i
agree
with
you
that
some
of
them
probably
come
close
to
that
puffery
line.
here,
though,
we
don't
just
have
those
statements
about
the
company
being
well
positioned
for
future
growth.
there
are
additional
statements,
and
these
were
made
to
stock
analysts
that
they
expected
a
50
percent
increase
in
annual
revenues,
and,
of
course,
there
are
the
much
more
affirmative
statements
that
the
drug's
safety
had
been
well-established
and
that
the
reports
of
anosmia
were
completely
unfounded
and
misleading.
those
statements
certainly
crossed
the
line.
and
as
i
said
before,
there
hasn't
been
an
argument
in
this
case
as
to
whether
those
less
specific
and
arguably
puffery
type
statements--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
yes,
i
think
it
would
depend,
again,
on
the
statements
the
company
makes.
if
--
if--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--okay.
so
--
so,
for
example,
if
--
if
a
company
had
been
faced
with
potential
adverse
effect
and
it
had
assembled
its
blue
ribbon
panel
of
scientists,
conclusively
determined
that
there
is
no
causal
connection
between
this
purported
adverse
effect
and
their
drug,
the
question
is,
would
they
have
to
disclose
in
that
circumstance?
i
think
if
the
company
had
simply
made
statements
relating
to
the
drug
safety,
we
think
our
drug
is
safe,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
causes
any
adverse
effects,
then
the
answer
is
no,
because
the
reported
adverse
effect
would
not
call
into
question
the
accuracy
of
the
company's
statements
relating
to
the
safety
of
the
drug.
if,
however,
the
company
had
made
specific
statements
relating
to
consumer
demand
for
its
products
and
it
knew,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
was
no
causal
connection,
it
knew
or
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
a
significant
portion
of
its
consumer
base
would
avoid
the
product,
then,
yes,
a
reasonable
investor
would
want
to
know
that
information,
and
under
basic
the
company
would
have
a
duty
to
disclose
that,
even
though
unfounded,
these
reports
may
lead
a
significant
percentage
of
our
consumer
base
to
leave
the
product.
i
think
that
falls
squarely
within
the
definition
of
materiality,
which
is
would
a
reasonable
investor
want
to
have
known
that
information?
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
this
court
in
both
tsc
and
basic
accorded
what
it
called
due
deference
to
the
sec's
views
on
the
application
of
the
materiality
standard.
i
think
it's
certainly
true
--
and
--
and
those,
by
the
way,
were
both
--
the
--
the
court
was
deferring
to
the
views
of
the
sec
as
expressed
in
amicus
briefs
to
the
court
just
like
in
this
case.
i
think
the
sec
is
due
a
significant
deference
based
on,
one,
its
long-standing
historical
practice
in
applying
the
materiality
standard,
which
is
part
of
its
own
rule,
rule
10b-5,
and
its
special
expertise
in
knowing
what
a
reasonable
investor
would
want
to
know
based
upon
its
experience
in
this
area.
so,
i
do
think
that
to
the
extent
there
is
any
ambiguity
remaining
in
this
case,
the
court
should
defer
to
the
sec's
views.
and
back
to
justice
breyer's
questions
about
what
should
the
court
write
simply
beyond
reiterating
the
basic
standard,
i
think
what
the
court
did
in
basic
was
it
not
only
articulated
the
general
standard,
but
it
laid
out
some
factors.
and
in
laying
out
those
factors,
that's
where
the
court
deferred
to
the
sec's
brief.
and
it
laid
out
factors
that
a
reasonable
investor
might
find
relevant
in
that
case
it
was
the
merger
context.
in
here
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
we
lay
out
several
factors
that
we
think
bear
on
the
materiality
question
in
this
particular
context;
that
is,
involving
adverse
drug
information.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
sure.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
if
you
mean
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
phase,
chief
justice?
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
think
there
would
be
some
cases.
and
in
fact,
we
know
there
are
dozens
of
12(b)(6)
motions
granted
in
securities
fraud
cases,
and
let
me
lay
out
a
few
scenarios
for
you.
one
would
be
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
scenario
where
the
company
has
not
made
any
actionable
statements.
it
has
either
--
statements
predicated
to
duty
to
disclose.
it
either
has
been
made--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--sure.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
sure.
two
responses
to
that.
one,
the
pslra
does
have
a
safe
harbor
for
companies
once
they
make
forward-looking
statements,
that
if
they
add
in
meaningful
cautionary
language
--
and
this
is
in
the
pslra
itself,
section
5(c)(1)(a),
that
if
they
add
in
meaningful
cautionary
statements,
then
they
cannot
be
subject
to
liability.
and
i
think
there
are
a
couple
other
scenarios
that
would
--
would
trigger,
for
example,
if
the
product
at
issue
is
such
a
small
percentage
of
the
company's
income
or
expected
growth
that
no
reasonable
investor
would
care
if
it
tanked,
then
that
might
be
a
circumstance
where
a
motion
to
dismiss
would
be
appropriate.
thank
you,
your
honor.
