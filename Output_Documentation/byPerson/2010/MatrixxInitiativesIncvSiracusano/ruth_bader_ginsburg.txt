mr.
hacker,
do
we
know
that
from
this
record?
i
mean,
we
know
that
the
plaintiffs
were
able
to
identify
--
there's
some
dispute
whether
it's
12
or
23,
but
do
you
represent
that
there
were
no
other
complaints
made?
so
that,
let's
say,
there
has
been
discovery;
now
we're
just
at
the
pleading
stage.
the
company
would
have
said:
that's
it,
we
didn't
have
any
more?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
might
have
been
able
through
discovery
to
find
that
there
were
many
more.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
shouldn't
that
determination
be
deferred
until
there's
discovery,
and
then
we
can
know
how
many
reports
there
really
were?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hacker
--
mr.
hacker,
you
just
said,
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
that
when
the
--
when
the
news
came
out
on
good
morning
america,
accurate
or
not,
there
was
an
obligation
to
do
something
about
it,
but
among
the
--
the
charges,
it's
not
simply
that
there
was
these
reports,
but
it's
the
way
the
company
responded
to
them:
two
press
releases
that
said
allegations
of
any
link
of
these
drugs
to
anosmia
are
completely
unfounded.
that
statement
was
made
even
after
the
--
what
was
it,
dr.
jafek?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--had
this
presentation,
and
he
was
going
to
put
zicam's
name
on
it
and
the
company
said,
you
don't
have
any
permission
to
do
that.
so
the
company
prevented
good
morning
america
from
happening
earlier,
and
it
made
these
affirmative
statements
that
there's
no
linkage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
scientific
report
that
came
out
later
said,
we
can't
say
one
way
or
the
other,
as
opposed
to
the
company
saying
that
any
suggestion
of
linkage
is
completely
unfounded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
didn't
say
"unfounded".
they
said
the
evidence
is
not
--
we
can't
say
yes
and
we
can't
say
no.
that's
different
from
completely
unfounded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
said
raw
adverse
event
reports.
am
i
not
right
that
all
of
these
reports
came
from
medical
doctors,
and
in
response
to
the
very
first
one,
the
company
representative
said,
yeah,
we've
been
getting
reports
since
1999?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question
is,
does
it
make
a
difference
if
these
reports
come
from
medical
experts
in
this
particular
field?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick
your
time
is
running
out,
and
there
is
one
thing
you
emphasize
in
your
brief,
and
i
haven't
heard
you
say
one
word
about
it
here.
and
that
is:
you're
saying
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
company
that
remains
silent.
the
company,
in
response
to
this,
issued
press
releases
in
which
it
said
any
suggestion
of
a
linkage
is
completely
unfounded.
now,
that's
something
different
from,
there
are
x
number
of
reports.
to
what
extent
are
you
relying
on
the
affirmative
statements
that
the
company
made?
