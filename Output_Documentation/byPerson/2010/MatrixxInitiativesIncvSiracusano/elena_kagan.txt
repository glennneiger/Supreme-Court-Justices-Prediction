well,
mr.
hacker,
you
were
saying
that
the
question
of
whether
there
is
support
is
reducible
to
the
question
of
whether
there
are
statistically
significant
findings.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
the
fda
takes
action
all
the
time
as
to
drugs
--
they
force
the
withdrawal
of
a
drug
from
the
market,
they
force
relabeling
of
a
drug
--
on
the
basis
of
findings
that
are
not
statistically
significant.
now,
clearly
in
those
cases
the
market
has
a
right
to
know
the
very
things
that
are
going
to
make
the
fda
take
action
against
a
product
and
that
are
going
to
severely
affect
the
product's
value
to
the
company.
not
statistical
significance
there.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it
could
and
eventually
it
did.
justice
elena
kagan
and
you
are
suggesting
a
test
for
what
--
what
counts
as
material,
which
is
statistically
significant,
a
test
that
the
fda
itself
doesn't
use
when
it
thinks
about
what
it
should
what
it
should
regulate.
justice
elena
kagan
in
most
cases
we
don't
know
whether
the
claim
is
false
or
not.
so
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical.
there's
a
pharmaceutical
company
and
it
comes
out
with
its
first
and
only
product,
it's
100
percent
of
the
sales,
and
it's
a
new
contact
lens
solution.
and
it
sells
this
product
to
many,
many,
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people.
and
most
of
them
use
this
product
with
no
adverse
effect
whatsoever,
but
there
are
ten
cases
where
somebody
uses
this
product
and
they
go
blind.
three
of
those
ten
cases,
the
person
had
to
borrow
a
contact
lens
from
a
friend,
only
used
it
in
one
eye,
they
go
blind
only
in
that
one
eye.
this
is
not
statistically
significant.
there
is
no
way
that
anybody
would
tell
that
you
these
ten
cases
are
statistically
significant.
would
you
stop
using
that
product
and
would
a
reasonable
investor
want
to
know
about
those
ten
cases?
justice
elena
kagan
there
are
a
lot
of
contact
lens
solutions
in
the
world.
so
if
i
heard
that,
ten
people
went
blind,
three
used
it
in
one
eye,
three
went
blind
in
that
eye,
i'd
stop
using
the
product;
and
if
i
were
holding
stock
in
that
company,
i
would
sell
the
stock.
justice
elena
kagan
but
mr.
frederick,
suppose
you
are
the
ceo
of
a
pharmaceutical
company
with
a
new
drug,
you've
just
put
it
back
on
the
market,
and
you
get
a
report
back,
this
drug
has
caused
a
death,
right?
this
is
your
first
adverse
effect
report.
do
you
have
to
disclose
it?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
shah,
what
deference
do
you
think
that
the
sec's
understanding
of
materiality
it's
entitled
to
and
why?
