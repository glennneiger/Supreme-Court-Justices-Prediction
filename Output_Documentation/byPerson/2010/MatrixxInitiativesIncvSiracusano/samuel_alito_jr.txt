can
there
be
some
situations
in
which
statistically
significant
evidence
would
not
be
necessary?
for
example,
suppose
some
very
distinguished
physicians
concluded
based
on
clinical
trials
that
there
was
a
connection
between
a
drug
and
a
very
serious
side
effect.
could
that
establish
materiality?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
allegations
of
materiality
are
based
solely
on
adverse
event
reports?
suppose
that
it's
alleged
that
ten
million
people
during
--
during
--
during
1
year
have
taken
a
particular
drug
and
five
people
shortly
after
taking
the
drug
have
developed
certain
--
have
had
an
adverse
--
have
had
--
experienced
an
adverse
event.
is
that
sufficient
to
go
to
a
jury?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now
we're
told
that
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
these;
for
a
--
for
a
typical
drug
there
may
be
thousands
of
these
adverse
event
reports
in
--
in
a
year,
and
you're
--
basically
you're
saying
all
of
those
have
to
be
disclosed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well
they
--
already.
so
then
why
does
the
company
have
to
make
additional
disclosure?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
analysts
who
follow
the
stock
price
can
easily
look
at
the
fda
web
site
and
see
the
adverse
event
reports
that
have
been
reported--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
draw
whatever
conclusions
seem
to
be
warranted
based
on
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
give
you
--
because
i'm
having
a
little
difficulty
understanding
the
boundaries
of
the
argument
you're
making.
let
me
give
2
hypotheticals,
and
they
both
involve
companies
that
have
one
product,
and
this
is
their
one
product.
the
first
one
was
what
i
mentioned
before,
and
i
wasn't
--
i
wasn't
clear
about
your
answer.
all
that's
alleged
is
that
a
very
large
number
of
people
took
the
drug
and
that
three
people,
after
taking
the
drug,
within
a
week
developed
a
certain
syndrome.
that's
the
first
one.
is
that
enough
for
materiality?
the
second
one
is
that
a
company
receives
a
telephone
call:
hello,
i'm
a
general
practitioner
from
wherever,
and
i
treated
a
patient
and
the
patient
took
your
medication
and
shortly
after
that
developed
this
syndrome,
and
i
think
there
might
be
a
connection.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
this
drug,
let's
say
it's
a
drug
to
relieve
the
common
cold
and
the
effect
is
loss
of
the
sense
of
smell.
five
million
people
take
it.
three
people,
after
taking
it,
lose
their
sense
of
smell.
is
that
enough
for
materiality
by
itself?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
company
makes
the
kind
of
relatively
common
statements
that
were
made
here,
poised
for
growth
in
the
upcoming
season,
very
strong
momentum
going
into
the
season,
extremely
well
positioned
for
successful
season?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
--
that
triggers
the
duty
to
disclose
the
satanic
rumors?
