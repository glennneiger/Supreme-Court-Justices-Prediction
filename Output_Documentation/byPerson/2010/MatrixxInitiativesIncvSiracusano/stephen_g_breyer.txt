justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
the
same
kind
of
question,
but
suppose
i
don't
really
know
how
drug
companies
operate.
i
suspect,
but
i
don't
know,
that
where
you
have
a
serious
drug,
people
are
hurt
all
the
time
and
they
blame
the
drug.
so
probably
drug
companies
operate
in
an
environment
where
they
get
all
kinds
of
complaints
and
some
are
valid,
some
are
not;
who
knows?
people
are
frightened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
i
don't
know
that.
but
you
say
at
the
beginning
your
client
says:
look,
we
get
complaints
all
the
time;
you
know,
just
put
up
with
it
if
you
buy
our
stock.
now,
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
that's
true.
i
don't
know
how
that
fits
in.
i
don't
know
whether
their
complaint
is
unusual
or
not
unusual
or
general.
who
is
supposed
to
decide
that?
the
judge
at
the
complaint
stage?
or
the
judge
after
you
get
some
evidence
on
it?
or
the
jury?
and
the
same
is
true
of
scienter,
after
all,
because
the
scienter
--
and
you
have
to
plead
that
with
particularity.
what's
your
answer?
what's
--
i
mean,
justice
kagan
had
an
interesting
view
of
this,
and
it
could
be
that
she's
putting
forward
and
others
might
have
a
different
view.
who
is
to
decide
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we
don't
know.
you
see,
what
they're
saying
is
we
have
one
respectable
doctor,
studier,
at,
you
know,
in
colorado.
he,
by
the
way
has
an
abstract,
which
isn't
in
the
complaint,
which
says
that
they
do
allege
that
it's
zinc
that's
the
problem,
a
free
zinc
ion.
and
they
say
we
also
have
25
people
who
were
hurt
and
some
burning
sensations
in
people
that
didn't
rise
to
that
level.
you
know,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
if
that's
within
the
range
of
expectation
of
drug
companies
as
part
of
the
normal
course
of
business
which
investors
should
know
about,
and
i
suspect
a
district
judge
doesn't
know,
either.
so
how
does
it
work
where
we
in
fact
just
don't
know
whether
this
does
or
not
arise
above
the
background
noise
of
a
drug
company?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
it
can't
be.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
mean
to
take
a
position
yet.
but,
look,
albert
einstein
had
the
theory
of
relativity
without
any
empirical
evidence,
okay?
so
we
could
get
the
greatest
doctor
in
the
world
and
he
has
dozens
of
theories,
and
the
theories
are
very
sound
and
all
that
fits
in
here
is
an
allegation
he
now
has
learned
that
it's
the
free
zinc
ion
that
counts.
and
that
could
be
devastating
to
a
drug
even
though
there
isn't
one
person
yet
who
has
been
hurt.
so
i
can't
see
how
we
can
say
this
statistical
evidence
always
works
or
always
doesn't
work.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
did.
they
said
--
they
said
the
free
zinc
ion
was
--
that
word
on
this
was
told
to
your
client
by
a
person
who
knows
a
lot
about
it,
is
apparently
reputable,
and
was
told
to
a
person
who
also
knows
a
lot
about
it.
i
think
they're
saying
you
ought
to
have
been
very
nervous
at
that
point.
that
isn't
just
the
usual
background
noise,
okay?
so
i'm
back
to
my
question,
which
is
--
you
can
answer
the
other
one
too
if
you
like.
but
my
question
is:
who
is
supposed
to
decide,
how?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
and
we
are
back
to
my
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
question
is,
the
facts
that
are
pleaded
is
--
i
think
it's
assumed
that
this
is
above
the
normal
background
noise;
they
certainly
argue
that
at
length
--
that
there
was
this
free
zinc
ion
conversation,
that
there
are
25
people
who
were
hurt,
and
there
is
a
lot
of
burning
sensation
going
on,
even
though
it
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
people
being
hurt,
and
that's
supported
by
some
of
the
zinc
sulfate
studies
in
the
fish--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay?
now,
they're
saying
that's
above
the
background
noise
and
you
say,
no,
it
isn't.
now,
who
decides
and
how
do
we
decide?
don't
we
have
to
go
to
a
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
i
know,
but
over--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we're
not
saying
--
you're
saying
if
you
are
a
scientist
--
now
we're
back
to
justice
scalia's
questions
and
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
then
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
because
the
sulfate
--
you
see
in
the
abstract,
which
they
didn't
put
in
the
complaint,
that
the
problem
that
they
saw
arising
out
of
the
zinc
sulfate
studies
was
the
free
zinc
ion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
trouble
is,
you
know,
the
truth
is
i
don't
know,
and
so
i'm
back
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
would
you
write
--
look,
i'm
asking
how
do
you
write
this,
because
what
--
where
i
think
where
the
other
side
has
a
point,
is
if
--
with
these
--
this
is
a
big
class
of
these
kinds
of
things,
you
know,
vitamins,
all
kinds
of
things
like
that
--
and
if
we
say
that
they
have
to
disclose
too
much,
what
will
happen
is
people
won't
pay
attention
to
it,
you
know.
and
if
--
if
you
have,
you
know,
4,000
pages
of
small
print
saying
everything
that
was
ever
reported,
what
really
happens
in
--
in
such
instances
is
the
public
pays
no
attention,
and
they
think
--
and
it
will
hide
things
that
are
actually
important.
so
how
would
you
write
some
words
--
assuming
that
you're
right,
that
their
test
is
wrong
--
but
how
would
you
write
some
words
that
will
put
a
disclosure
obligation
such
that
it's
not
going
to
be
overkill
and
it
is
going
to
get
incidents
that
rise
above
the
background
noise,
and
those
are
the
incidents
that
are
--
that
would
be
significant
for
a
reasonable
investor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
i'll
go
back
and
read
what
you've
just
said,
and
--
i
will,
because
it
will
be
in
the
transcript,
and
--
and
the
--
i
--
this
case,
you
are
very
good,
your
clients,
and
the
lawyers
at
writing
complaints.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right?
so
they've
alleged
in
this
complaint
everything
they
can
show,
and
i
--
i
suspect
--
and
during
the
class
period.
and
what
it
doesn't
say
is
that
very
helpful
chart
that
you
put
in
the
brief,
in
the
pocket.
it
doesn't
say
they
ever
showed
that
to
the
company.
all
it
says
is
there
was
a
phone
call
and
this
individual
from
--
from
colorado
said
something,
which
it
doesn't
specify,
about
zinc
and
the
--
and
the
number
of
deaths.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
get
that.
can
i
just
ask
you
one
question
in
response
to
--
just
picking
up
on
the
last,
what
about
the
need
for
a,
quote,
"strong
inference
of
scienter",
end
quote,
and
does
this
complaint
show
more
than
a
borderline
situation
where
it
doesn't
strongly
infer
that
the
person
intended
to
mislead
the
defendant?
what
about
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
page
49
of
their
brief
--
they
have
two
pages
on
it
--
it
does
not
give
rise
to
a
strong
inference
of
scienter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i
mean
--
i
just
want
to
know
why,
if
their
inference
on
materiality
is
enough
to
survive
the
background
noise
reply,
is
it
enough
to
show
a
strong
inference
that
they
did
do
this
intending
to
mislead,
a
strong
inference
of
scienter?
