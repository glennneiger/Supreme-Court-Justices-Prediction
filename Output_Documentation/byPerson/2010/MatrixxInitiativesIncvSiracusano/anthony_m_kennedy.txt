well,
suppose
you
stipulate
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
that
it
is
irrational,
that
it
is
probably
baseless,
but
that
the
market
will
react
adversely.
is
there
a
duty
then
to
address
the
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
there's
a
baseless
report
and
we
stipulate
that,
although
it's
baseless,
it's
going
to
affect
the
market,
could
that
be
the
basis
for
an
allegation,
assuming
the
requisite
scienter,
that
there's
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
not
the
allegation.
it's
the
fact
that
the
market
may
be
affected.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought
this
might
come
up.
at
some
point
do
we
look
at
scienter
and
then
go
back
from
that
to
whether
or
not
it's
material,
i.e.,
the
argument
would
be
the
company
knew
that
this
would
affect
the
price,
and
that's
why
they
didn't
disclose
it
and
therefore
that
shows
it's
material?
or
do
we
do
this
with
two
isolated
boxes:
one,
materiality,
two,
scienter,
and
we
don't
mix
the
analyses.
