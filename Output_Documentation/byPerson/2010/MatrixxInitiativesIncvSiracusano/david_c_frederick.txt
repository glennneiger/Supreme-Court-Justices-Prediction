mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
tsc
and
basic,
this
court
reaffirmed
the
longstanding
rule
that
materiality
is
judged
based
on
the
total
mix
of
information
available
to
investors.
matrixx
initially
sought
a
major
change
to
this
court's
contextual
approach
to
materiality
by
offering
a
bright
line
standard
of
statistical
significance.
in
its
reply
brief,
matrixx
offer
--
offers
a
rule
that
would
apply
only
in
the
hypothetical
scenario
where
investors
rely
solely
on
numbers
of
adverse
event
reports
in
pleading
securities
fraud.
this
court
should
reject
both
arguments
in
this
case.
the
broad
theory
has
numerous
legal
and
policy
flaws.
first,
the
longstanding
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
best
comports
with
the
varied
reasons
why
investors
make
investment
decisions.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
probably
not
sufficient
to
go
a
jury
absent
a
drop
in
the
stock
price,
absent
evidence
that
there
was
a
scientifically
plausible
link,
absent
evidence
that
the
product
was
highly
important
to
the
company's
long-term
financial
prospects.
all
of
these
things
go
into
the
contextual
mix
that
investors
would
regard
as
important
in
making
an
investment
decision,
and
they
all
happen
to
be
present
here.
we--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--under
the
basic
test,
your
honor,
that
very
well
might
if
the
probability
and
the
magnitude
of
the
harm
--
if
those
five
incidents
were
deaths
from
a
product
that
was
easily
substitutable,
that
might
be
a
relevant
decision
and
information
that
investors
might
want
to
take
into
account.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
this
goes
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
as
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
there
could
very
well
be
materiality.
the
information
might
be
important
for
investors,
but
it
could
very
well
be
that
the
people
making
the
disclosures
don't
have
the
requisite
scienter
because
there
is
an
absence
of
any
plausible
relationship.
the
stock
price
might
drop
on
news
that
would
not
be
regarded
as
news
that
the
most
highly
scientifically
rational
people
would
take
into
account.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they're
both
analytically
distinct
and
related,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
don't
have
a
simple
answer
for
you
because
many
of
the
recorded
cases
raise
issues
of
both
materiality
and
scienter.
what
the
court
has
said
in
basic
is
that
the
test
is
the
total
mix
of
information
and
whether
that
--
under
that
total
mix
the
investor
would
find
that
information
important.
in
tellabs
the
court
said
that
whether
or
not
the
inferences
of
scienter
could
be
deemed
as
plausible
as
other
inferences
based
on
the
mental
state
of
the
people
making
the
information.
so
the
court
has
announced
separate
tests.
in
a
case
like
this
there
is
a
natural
overlap,
and
in
fact
the
other
side
has
litigated
this
case
on
the
basis
that
no
one
would
have
thought
within
the
company,
based
on
the
adverse
event
reports,
that
there
was
a
basis
for
thinking
there
was
information.
we
plead
the
other
way
by
saying
that
when
you
have
three
medical
specialists
in
three
distinct
periods
where
the
last
wants
to
bring
findings
to
the
leading
ear,
nose
and
throat
medical
society
suggesting
that,
based
on
studies
that
go
back
as
far
back
as
the
1930s,
there
is
a
scientifically
plausible
link
based
on
the
zinc
ions,
that's
something
that
the
company
should
have
taken
seriously
and
disclosed
to
investors.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i
guess
the
first
thing
i
would
say
is
if
the
drug
has
not
been
fda
approved,
that
would
be
material
information
that
investors
might
want
to
know.
if
the
drug
had
been
fda
approved
and
that
report
was
then
submitted
to
the
fda,
i
think
that
there's
a
closer
call
depending
on
the,
you
know,
effect
of
the
report
that
might
be
on
the
stock
price,
because
that's
the
only
company
product
and
the
other
factors
that
we've
mentioned
in
our
brief.
i
think
the
question
of
one
event
is
obviously
much
more
difficult
than
where
there
are
multiple
events
submitted
by
doctors
with
a
scientifically
plausible
basis
on
a
product
that's
70
percent
of
the
company's
revenues.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
alito,
they
already
are
all
disclosed.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--right.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
why
i
think
this
presents
the
issue
in
a
rather
artificial
way,
because
the
reports
here
were
not
the
classic
fda-regulated
adverse
event
reports.
this
was
a
homeopathic
drug
that
was
put
on
the
market
without
fda
approval,
and
there
were
no
requirements
of
reports
until
2006
which
was
after
the
--
at
issue
here.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
would
start
with
the
language
in
basic
which
says
the
total
mix
of
information
is
what
has
long
standing
been
the
test
for
materiality
under
this
court's
cases.
i
would
say
that
where
there
is
credible
medical
professionals
describing
the
harms
based
on
credible
scientific
theories
to
back
up
the
link,
a
very
serious
health
effect
risk
for
products
with
many
substitutes,
and
the
effect
is
on
a
predominant
product
line,
then
the
company
ought
to
disclose
that
information.
i
will
not--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--right.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
in
1999,
though,
justice
breyer,
dr.
hirsch,
and
this
is
outlined
at
paragraph
25
of
the
complaint,
also
said
that
intranasal
application
of
zinc
could
be
problematic,
and
he
specifically
asked
about
how
much
zinc
is
put
in
zicam
precisely
because
of
his
awareness
of
prior
studies
going
all
the
way
back
to
the
polio
period
in
which
zinc
had
created
a
problem
of
persistent
anosmia.
but
our
submission
here
is
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
really
depends,
justice
sotomayor,
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
evasive,
but
if
there
is
a
product,
say,
that
has
some
link
to
satanic
influences,
and
there
is
some
reason
to
think
that
a
large
body
of
followers
in
an
irrational
way
might
regard
there
to
be
satanic
influences
on
the
basis
of
a
particular
product,
a
cautious,
reasonably
prudent
investor
might
want
to
know
that
on
the
basis
of
that
information
that
most
of
us
would
regard
as
irrational,
might
affect
the
stock
price.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
are
two
answers,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
is
in
basic
itself,
the
court
talked
about
the
actions
of
a
reasonable
investor,
and
this
court
and
many
courts
have
always
looked
at
a
reasonable
person's
standard
in
making
all
sorts
of
these
fine
judgments
about
the
importance
of
particular
information.
but
the
second
answer
is--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--what
i
said
was
if
the
product
was
one
that
might
be,
you
know,
attractive
in
some
way
to
people
who
had
that
particular
following.
i
think
you
have
to
link
up
the
product
with
the
nature
of
the
complaint
and
the
effect
of
the
importance
of
the
information--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--you're--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
your
honor,
there
are
people
who
follow
those
things,
and
they
spend
money
and
they
buy
stocks,
but
my
second
point
is
that
scienter
--
scienter
is
the
other
way
around
this
problem.
because
even
though
information--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
justice
scalia,
you
can
certainly
write
as
a
prophylactic
here
that
that
isn't
part
of
--
the
test.
we
certainly
have
here
all
of
the
indicia
of
credible
medical
professionals
on
a
credible
scientific
theory
on
a
product
that
was
important
to
the
company's
finances,
and
a
very
serious
side
effect
for
a
drug
that
had
ready--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--now,
i'm
saying
two
things.
one
is
that
there
is
a
difference
between
scienter
and
materiality.
there
is
importance
of
information
and
an
intent
to
deceive,
and
the
questions
are
analytically
distinct.
in
your
hypothetical,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
you
merged
them,
and
i
would
like
to
keep
them
separate
because
as
we
--
as
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
the
issue
is
what
is
the
standard
for
materiality
and
whether
or
not
statistical
significance
is
the
only
way
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--on
the
second
one,
i
would
say
probably
not.
and
i
would
say
on
the
first
one,
there's
not
enough
information
about
the
side
effect
and
what
the
drug
is
intended
to
solve.
i
mean,
the
probability
magnitude
test
as
articulated
by
this
court
goes
to
the
probability
of
the
effect
versus
the
magnitude
that
would
be
perceived
by
investors,
and
those
are
important
factors
they
go
into.
so
your
hypothetical
is
very
difficult
to
answer
as
you
have
framed
it.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
--
by
itself,
that
could
be
enough,
and
the
reason
we
know
that
could
be
enough,
justice
alito,
is
that
when,
you
know,
some
score
additional
were
released
and
this
information
was
disclosed,
the
stock
price
went
down
by
23.8
percent.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we're
relying
on
those
to
establish
scienter,
both
at
the
beginning
of
the
class
period
when
they
forced
dr.
jafek,
through
their
legal
threats,
to
take
zicam
off
his
poster
presentation,
and
then
later
when
they
said
that
the
reports
of
anosmia
were
completely
unfounded.
and
"misleading"
was
the
word
that
they
used.
"and
misleading".
and
they
repeated
that
after
the
good
morning
america
program
came
on,
only
to
say
three
weeks
later,
after
empaneling
a
scientific
expert
panel,
that
the
information
was
insufficient
to
make
that
determination.
our
submission
is
that
that
is
enough.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
it
would
depend
on
what
kind
of
stock
effect
occurred.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
depends
--
it
depends
on
this
court's
application
of
its
known
precedent,
which
my
colleague
here
has
not
even
referenced
in
his
opening
argument,
basic,
which
says
you
look
at
the
total
mix
of
the
information.
and
all
of
these
things
go
into
play.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
we
believe,
and
they
haven't
argued
that
this
complaint
is
not
sufficient
under
the
pslra,
which
set
the
heightened
pleading
standard
for
scienter
that
this
court
articulated
and
construed
in
the
tellabs
decision,
so
we
believe
that
scienter
is
adequately
pleaded
here
based
on--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
is
already
a
heightened
pleading
standard,
justice
breyer.
i
was
not
--
i
misunderstood
your
question
to
say,
is
there
some
other
heightened
pleading
standard
other
than
the
one--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
key
aspects
here
are
their
treatment
of
jafek
when
jafek
was
going
to
go
public
with
his
scientifically
linked
claim
of
anosmia
from
the
zicam,
and
then
subsequently
when
they
issued
press
releases
saying
it
would
be
completely
unfounded
and
misleading
to
assert
any
causal
link.
that
is
sufficient
to
establish
a
strong
inference
of
scienter.
