justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hacker,
the
complaint
did
not
rely
exclusively
upon
these
adverse
incidents
but
also
referred
to
a
study,
a
report
by
researchers
at
the
american
rhinologic
society--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
--
which
asserted
that
there
was
a
connection.
so
the
--
is
the
question
before
us
simply
whether
in
isolation
the
adverse
incidents
would
be
enough,
or
is
not
the
question
whether
those
adverse
incidents
placed
next
to
this
study
would
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
they
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
the
--
you're
saying
the
complaint
did
not
refer
to
the
study?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hacker,
suppose
good
morning
america
made
the
same
claim,
categorically
saying
that
this
drug
caused
this
condition,
but
did
so
simply
on
the
basis
of
these
adverse
incidents,
and
they
didn't
have
dr.
jafek's,
or
whatever
his
name
is,
reports,
but
nonetheless
good
morning
america
comes
out
on
the
basis
of
those
incidents
saying
zicam
causes
whatever
the
condition
is.
would
that
have
to
be
reported?
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
are
unreasonable
investors
who
are
relying
on
some
talking
head
on
good
morning
america
who
says
that
this
is
true,
even
though
it
isn't
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
neither
answered
yes
or
no.
there's
no
basis
for
its
being
said
on
good
morning
america,
but
unreasonable
investors
by
the
thousands
rely
upon
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
course,
if
i
may
interject--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
fda
acts
in
the
public
interest,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
doesn't
make
money
by
withdrawing
a
drug
from
the
market?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
opposed
to
somebody
who
sues,
who
makes
money
on
the
lawsuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
was
the
only
product,
they
sold
that
might
be
enough,
five
adverse
reports
out
of
ten
million?
if
--
if
that's
the
only
product
they
make,
you
say,
totality
of
the
circumstances,
that
may
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
if
scienter
is
--
it
seems
to
me
ridiculous
to
--
to
hold
companies
to
--
to
irrational
standards;
and
we
did
--
and
we
did
say
in
--
in
basic
that
it's
viewed
--
whether
it
would
be
viewed
by
the
reasonable
investor.
and
--
and
you
are
saying
well,
the
reasonable
investor
takes
account
of
the
irrationality.
i
don't
think
that's
what
we
meant
in
--
in
basic.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
frederick,
i'm
--
i'm
not
clear
on
why
you
can
draw
a
distinction
between
materiality
and
scienter
for
purposes
of
the
issue
before
us
here.
if,
indeed,
satanic
effect
is
enough
for
materiality,
you
say,
well,
it
may
not
be
enough
for
scienter.
why?
i
mean,
if
the
company
knows
that
satanic
effect
is
material,
then
the
company
has
--
knowingly
withholds
it
because
it
thinks
satanic
effect
is
irrational,
why
doesn't
that
company
have
scienter,
if
it's
material?
the
scienter
is
withholding
something
that
is
material
that
is
known
to
be
material,
and
once
you
say
that
--
you
know,
that
satan
is
material,
if
the
company
thinks
satan
is
involved
here,
it
has
to
put
it
in
its
report,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's
no
difference
between
the
materiality
issue
and
the
scienter
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
push
this
problem
off
onto
the
scienter
side
of
the
equation.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shah,
what
do
you
think
about
satan?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
haven't
said
that.
they
haven't
said
that
our
sales
are
going
to
double.
they're
just
walking
along
at
normal
sales.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
find
out
that
10
percent
of
nutty-nuttys
out
there
are
not
going
to
buy
their
stuff
because
of
satan.
what
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
government's
position
is
that
reports
of
adverse
effects
that
have
no
scientific
basis,
so
long
as
they
would
affect
irrationally
consumers,
have
to
be
disclosed,
assuming
the
company
has
said
we're
doing
well,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
if
satan
comes
in,
surely
lousy
science
comes
in
as
well,
no?
