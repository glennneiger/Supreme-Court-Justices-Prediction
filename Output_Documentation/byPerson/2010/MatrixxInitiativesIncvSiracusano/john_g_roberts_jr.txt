chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-1156,
matrixx
initiatives
v.
james
siracusano.
mr.
hacker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
talking
about
--
you're
talking
about
who
is
right
or
wrong
about
the
connection
between
matrixx
and
anosmia.
but
that's
not
the
question.
i'm
an
investor
in
matrixx;
i
worry
whether
my
stock
price
is
going
to
go
down.
you
can
have
some
psychic
come
out
and
say
"zicam
is
going
to
cause
a
disease.
"
with
no
support
whatsoever,
but
if
it
causes
the
stock
to
go
down
20
percent,
it
seems
to
me
that's
material.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
reasonable
investor
is
going
to
worry
about
the
fact
that
thousands
of
unreasonable
investors
are
going
to
dump
their
matrixx
stock.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
unreasonable
about
that.
if
it
looks
--
if
you're
looking
at
good
morning
america,
you
say,
my
gosh,
everybody
else
is
going
to
sell
this;
i'm
going
to
sell,
too.
and
if
it
turns
out
you
knew
about
it
you
should
have
told
me
about
it
before.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
may
not
know,
but
it
certainly
can
know.
if
you
know
this
is
a
very
false
report,
but
we
know
that,
i
don't
know,
the
surgeon
general,
somebody,
is
going
to
come
out
and
announce
it
and
that
will
cause
an
effect--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
hacker.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
response
to
justice
alito,
i
heard
you
say
something
about
a
scientifically
plausible
link?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
rather
significant
concession.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
it's
not
simply
the
fact
that
some
psychic
would
say
something,
that
that
is
not
sufficient,
even
if
that
has
an
impact
on
the
market
price,
that
there
has
to
be
some
scientifically
plausible
link
to
the
report?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
protection
is
there
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
in
response
to
allegations?
because
it
doesn't
have
to
be
scientifically
valid;
it
can
be
completely
irrational.
all
you
have
to
do
is
allege
that,
you
know,
if
you
had
told
this
the
price
would
have
gone
down.
if
you
had
disclosed
this
the
price
would
have
gone
down,
and
the
response
from
the
company
is,
well,
but
this
is
just
ridiculous.
this
is
some
guy
in
his
garage
who
writes
this
out
on
--
on
a
--
you
know,
a
piece
of
paper
in
--
in
handwriting;
and
the
response
is
going
to
be,
well
let's
let
the
jury
sort
it
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
just
told
me
that
it
would
be
enough
if
somebody
says
that
there's
a
satanic,
you
know,
impact
on
this,
because
a
reasonable
investor
would
say
there
are
enough
crazy
people
out
there
that
this
is
going
to
affect
the
price.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
matters
whether
--
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
product
has
particular
satanic
susceptibility--
[laughter]
--but
i
mean,
are
you
saying
it
matters
if
it's
something
that
--
that
satan's
not
going
to
be
interested
in?
i
don't
understand.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
mean
to
be
facetious,
but
your
way
of
distinguishing
the
satanic
product
is
that
it
depends
on
whether
people
who
follow
satanic
cults
are
going
to
be
interested
or
not.
i
mean--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
that
--
i'm
just
trying
to
get
your
response
to
that.
you
just
talked
again
about
credible
scientists
and
all
that,
and
you're
putting
those
other
things
to
one
side.
so
even
if
you
have
your
satanic
problem,
that
is
not
enough.
and
you
can
sit
there
and
allege
it
would
cause
a
drop
of
30
percent
in
the
stock
price,
and
you
should
have
let
this
know.
your
answer
is
no,
they
don't
have
to
let
--
they
don't
have
to
disclose
this
because
there
is
no
scientific
credible
basis
for
the
link
that's
alleged?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
shah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
have
--
you
just
said
they
would
have
a
duty
to
disclose?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
earlier
just
said
there's
no
affirmative
duty
to
disclose;
it
only
is
based
on
what
they
say?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
way
that
consideration
of
those
factors
would
support
a
--
a
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
pharmaceutical
manufacturer,
other
than
the
fact
of
having
an
extremely
poor
lawyer
drafting
a
complaint?
anytime
you
have
a
variety
of
factors
like
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
it's
very
difficult
for
the
judge
to
say
anything
other
than
that's
for
the
jury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
--
i'm
talking
about
materiality.
in
other
words,
based
solely
on
--
in
other
words,
you're
saying
if
they
say
anything
related,
it's
going
to
be
enough--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--whether
it's
a
scientific
basis
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hacker,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
at
this
moment,
the
court
will
observe
a
moment
of
silence
in
honor
of
the
victims
of
the
shooting
in
tucson
and
join
the
rest
of
the
nation
in
doing
so
and
i
invite
the
members
of
the
bar
and
the
spectators
to
join,
thank
you
very
much.
