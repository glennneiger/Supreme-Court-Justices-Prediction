mr.
jonathan
hacker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
all
drug
companies
receive
on
an
almost
daily
basis
anecdotal
hearsay
reports
about
alleged
adverse
health
events
following
the
use
of
their
products.
those
incident
reports
do
not
themselves
establish
any
reliable
facts
about
the
drug's
performance
or
its
safety,
especially
where,
as
here,
there
are
only
a
handful
of
reports
out
of
millions
of
products
sold
over
a
4-year
period,
and--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--all
i
can
speak
for
is
what's
alleged
in
the
complaint,
and
the
complaint,
no
matter
how
read,
doesn't
allege
any
more
than
23
adverse
event
reports.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
that's
true,
but
there's
no
allegation
that
what
they
--
what
they
know
about
or
what
they
could
find
would
have
been
a
statistically
significant
difference
between
the
rate
of
reported
events
and
the
background
of--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--because
it's
incumbent
on
a
plaintiff
to
come
to
court
with
a
case,
to
plead
the
facts
necessary
to
establish
all
of
the
elements
of
a
claim.
and
a
securities
fraud
claim,
of
course,
requires
both
materiality
and
scienter,
and
neither
of
those
is
established
unless
the
company
has
knowledge
of
facts
establishing
a
reliable
basis
for
inferring
that
the
drug
itself
is
the
cause
of
the
reported
event.
absent
information
like
that,
there
is
neither
materiality
nor
scienter
under
the
securities
laws,
because
neither
the
company
nor
an
investor
--
until
there's
reliable
evidence
of
a
causal
link
between
the
two
products,
neither
a
company
--
excuse
me,
a
link
between
the
product
and
the
event
--
neither
the
company
nor
investor
would
have
any
reason
to
think
that
an
adverse
event
report
is
--
actually
indicates
a
problem
with
the
product,
as
opposed
to
a
coincidence.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
i
think
a
distinguished
physician
would
not
conclude
that
there's
a
connection
unless
the
clinical
trials
reveal
a
statistically
significant
difference
between
what
they've
seen
and
what
they
would
expect
to
see
were
there
no
association.
so
there's
that
point,
your
honor.
but
the
second
point
i
would
make
is,
we
acknowledge
there
are
a
very
narrow,
limited
number
of
circumstances
under
which
a
claim
can
be
pled
absent
statistically
significant
evidence,
but
that's
--
that's
because
doctors
and
researchers
will
conclude
that
there
may
be
causation
under
narrow
circumstances.
for
example,
i
think
the
most
common
set
of
criteria
are
the
bradford-hill
criteria.
but
nothing
like
that
is
pled
here,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
yes.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well,
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
the
plaintiffs
have
throughout
this
litigation
framed
their
case
as
one
based
on
the
failure
to
disclose
adverse
event
reports.
it's
the
number
of
adverse
event
reports
that
they
say
is
the
problem,
and
they're
not
saying
that
there
was
a
study
out
there
and
that
we
failed
to
disclose
the
study.
but
they
say
it's
the
fact
of
the
adverse
event
reports.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
--
to
be
clear,
the
study
is
not
attached
to
the
complaint,
so
there
wasn't
a
basis
in
the
complaint
for
saying
the
company
was
aware
of
a
reliable
study
and
here
are
the
details
of
the
study
and
they
failed
to
disclose
it.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
it
did
refer
to
it.
that's
true.
and
if
you
look
at
the
study,
there's
really
nothing
there.
it's
based
on,
primarily
on
a
case
study
of
one
--
and
again,
this
isn't
in
the
complaint.
it
is
attached
to
the
red
brief,
your
honor.
there's
one
case
study
of
one
man
who
is
55
year
old
--
55
years
old,
which
is
the
population
most
likely
to
experience
anosmia.
you're
more
likely
to
get
it
when
you're
--
he's
suffering
from
signs
of
lupus.
which
causes
anosmia,
and
he
is
taking
flonase,
which
also
causes
anosmia.
and
so
the
idea
that
you
can
infer
from
that
one
incident
out
of
millions
over
years
of
product
sales
that
--
that
zicam
causes
anosmia
under
the--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--that's
precisely
the
point,
your
honor.
if
a
psychic
came
out
or
a
lunatic
on
the
street
corner
is
barking,
you
know,
through
a
megaphone
that
there's
a
problem
with
the
product,
that's
not
the
kind
of
information
to
rely
--
a
real
investor
would
rely
on.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
it
may
make
a
difference,
your
honor,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that,
you
know,
these
are
psychics.
the
point
simply
is,
following
up
on
the
chief
justice's
question,
that
it
does
matter
what
the
basis
of
the
allegation,
and
is
the
evidence,
the
facts
available
to
the
company,
reliable?
does
it
create
a
reliable
inference
that
a
reasonable
investor
would
be
concerned
about?
mr.
jonathan
hacker
under
the
case
law,
it's
not
clear
that
that's
true.
in
this
case,
looking
at
this
case
specifically,
your
honor,
when
the
market
reacted,
what
the
market
was
reacting
to
was
a
good
morning
america
report.
it's
very
important
to
be
clear
about
what
that
report
said.
on
good
morning
america,
a
leading
morning
news
program,
the
allegation
was
made
by
dr.
jafek
that
zicam
causes
anosmia.
that's
a
very
different
allegation
that
what
the
company
was
--
than
what
it
was
the
company
was
aware
of,
which
was
simply
the
adverse
event
reports.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
two
answers
i
would
say,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
we
have
to
be
very
careful
about
creating
a
rule
through
our
interpretation
of
materiality
that
would
require
companies
in
advance
to
disclose
the
fact
that
a
baseless,
false
allegation
about
the
company
is
going
to
come
out
because
it
requires
the
company
to
ring
the
bell--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--well,
i
understand,
but
the
problem
is
it's
the
underlying
--
what
the
rule
would
say
is,
because
the
company
is
aware
the
market
may
be
affected,
the
company
in
advance
has
to
say:
a
false
report
about
us
is
about
to
come
out.
it
requires
the
company
to
first
ring
the
bell
and
then
un-ring
it
in
the
same
statement,
and
that's
not
a
good
rule
for
companies.
shareholders
wouldn't
want
that
rule,
to
require
companies
to
denigrate
their
product
and
then
do
their
best
to
explain
why
the
allegation
is
untrue.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
right.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well,
what
they
said
was,
and
this
was
true,
that
it
was
completely
unfounded
and
misleading.
the
very
scientific
panel
that
plaintiffs
themselves
rely
on,
which
convened
and
issued
its
report
2
weeks
later,
confirms
that.
there
was
no
--
it's
absolutely
unfounded
at
the
time
to--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--and
that's
correct,
there
isn't.
when
--
when
the
scientific
panel
said
you
can't
make
that
claim,
it's
unfounded,
there's
no
basis
in
the
available
science.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well,
i'm
--
with
respect,
your
honor,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
it
is.
when
you're
talking
about
science,
you
make
a
claim
that's
either
supported
in
the
science
or
it's
without
support,
and
the
point
the
scientific
panel
was
making
is
there
was
no
support
in
the
available
science,
and
what
jafek
was
relying
on
was
unreliable.
as
i
just
described,
the
one--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--that's
true,
but
the
problem
with
that
sort
of
standard
--
well,
first
of
all,
to
emphasize,
to
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
fda
didn't
take
any
action
until
5
years
later,
but
--
which
shows--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--but
that's--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--the
problem
is
ex
ante.
you
have
to
--
you
can't
look
at
this
through
hindsight.
you
have
to
look
at
it
ex
ante.
when
a
company
has
a
handful
of
reports,
it's
absolutely
true,
nobody
would
dispute,
that
some
day
in
the
future,
with
the
accumulation
of
more
data,
the
fda
may
take
action
based
on
its
own
prophylactic
public
health
regulatory
discretion.
but
at
the
time,
ex
ante,
no
company
when
it
gets
an
adverse
event
report
can
possibly
know
whether
that's
enough
information
for
the
fda
to
act.
so
the
prospect
that
the
fda
may
some
day
act
on
the
basis
of
additionally
accumulated
information
would
require
disclosure
of
all
reports
all
the
time,
and
that
we
submit
cannot
be
the
standard.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
i
think
what
you
would
have
to
be
hypothesizing
is
evidence
that
the
company,
say
a
week
in
advance,
knew
that
good
morning
america
was
going
to
come
out
and
say
that.
because
once
good
morning
america
says
it,
it's
said
it
and
the
effect
is
what
it
is.
but
even
in
the
hypothetical,
you'd
have
to
sort
of
unpack
what
you
said.
if
good
morning
america
came
out
and
said
just
what
matrixx
knew
at
the
time,
there
are
a
handful
of
adverse
event
reports,
it's
over
millions
of
product
uses
over
a
4-year
period,
and
no
indication
that
that's
at
all
in
any
way
different
from
the
incident
rate
in
the
general
population,
especially
among
cold
users,
who
of
course
are
most
likely
to
experience
anosmia,
we
don't
know
what
would
have
happened.
but
then
you
add
the
element
that
good
morning
america
then
declares
that
zicam
causes
anosmia
--
again,
the
hypothetical
would
have
to
be
in
advance
matrixx
is
aware
that
the
false
claim
is
going
to
be
made.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
right,
and
i
would
say,
first
of
all,
we
have
to
be
very
careful,
as
i
said
before,
about
a
rule
that
requires
a
company
to
disclose
false
facts.
i
would
say,
second,
that
a
reasonable
investor
doesn't
want
false
information;
a
reasonable
investor
wants
accurate
information.
and
a
reasonable
investor
would
actually--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--that's
the
third
point
i
would
make,
your
honor,
is
it's
a
different
case,
a
fundamentally
different
case,
if
you're
talking
about
a
media--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--and
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
i
think
the
reason
it's
no,
a
qualified
no,
is
because--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--the
law
doesn't
respond
to
irrational,
unpredictable,
or
unreasonable
investors.
it
responds
to
a
reasonable
investor
who
wants
accurate
--
a
reasonable
investor
is
going
to
hold
the
stock.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
i
absolutely
understand
that.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
the
point
i
would
make
is,
first
of
all,
a
company
ex
ante
can't
know
when
that's
going
to
happen.
so
all
the
hypotheticals
are
suggesting
some
way
of
knowing
the
company--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--that's
why
it's
a
meaningfully
different
case.
if
the
plaintiffs
had
plead
in
their
complaint
that
there's
a
memo
inside
the
company,
for
example,
so
this
false
fact
is
going
to
come
out,
and
we
know
it's
going
to
cause
a
stock
drop,
that
would
be
a
case
involving
the
materiality
of
a
media
splash,
a
big
media
event.
it
can't
be
that
there's
a
false
claim
out
there
somewhere
and
the
company
becomes
aware
of
the
false
claim
and
then
purely
hypothetically
it's
possible
that
somebody
will
make
the
false
claim.
it
becomes
also
possible
that
the
media
will
pick
up
and
not
be
persuaded
to
ignore
the
false
claim.
that's
the
kind
of
case
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
i
would
want
to
know
more
about
the
number
of
uses
and
all
that,
but,
no,
there
wouldn't
be
a
basis.
a
reasonable
investor
would
want
to
know
all
the
facts
and
details
that
would
establish
a
reason
to
draw
a--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--the
problem
is,
there
has
to
be
some
reliable
basis.
you
may
be
describing
facts
that
would
satisfy
the
bradford
hill
criteria,
for
example,
where
you
can
draw
a
reliable
inference
that
the
product
is
the
cause.
that's
the
key
here.
there
has
to
be
a
reliable
basis
for
inferring
causation.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
very
much
so.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well,
ultimately
it's
a
question
--
it
would
go
all
the
way
to
the
jury
if
the
plaintiffs
were
able
to
plead
facts
in
the
complaint
that
entitled
them
to--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--we
think
the
answer
is
statistical
significance,
just
like
the
second
circuit
said
in
carter-wallace--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--but,
your
honor,
out
of
millions
of
uses,
if
there
was
that
problem,
it
wouldn't
be
hard
to
plead
a
case
that
says
there
is
a
significant
problem--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--well,
i
think
a
plaintiff
--
i
mean,
i
may
just
be
repeating
myself,
but
a
plaintiff
has
to
plead
the
facts
that
would
entitle
them
to
relief
at
the
end
of
the
day.
so,
i'm
not
saying
a
judge--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--and--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--i
think
you
need
to--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--the
answer
is
no,
your
honor,
because
there
is
no
basis
on
those
pleaded
facts
for
inferring
that
there's
actually
a
problem
with
the
zinc
ion--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--but
look
at
the
allegations--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--but
it
matters
what
a
scientist
would
think
because
it's
only
then
that
anybody
ex
ante,
again,
remember--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--has
a
basis
for
inferring
that
there
is
a
causal
link
which
would
be
the
problem,
and
the
zinc
--
to
be
very
clear,
to
be
very
clear
about
the
zinc
studies,
the
claim
made
on
the
telephone
wasn't
even
a
claim
of
causation.
it
said,
are
you
aware
of
the
zinc
sulfate
studies,
which
of
course
is
a
fundamentally
different
compound
than--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--no,
the
zinc
sulfate
studies
were
--
totally
irrelevant.
what
they
cited
for
the
free
zinc
ions
were
studies
of
catfish
and
turtles.
and
nobody
thinks,
nobody
thinks,
that
you
can
infer
anything
from
a
study
of
catfish
and
turtles
about
their
smell
sensation
and
human
beings.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well,
in
terms
of
scienter,
under
the
securities
law
there
has
to
be
a
plausible
basis--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--let
me
--
let
me
start
with
the
premise
of
the
question
presented.
it's
presented
on
the
facts
as
the
case
has
been
litigated
today,
trying
to
rely
on
adverse
event
reports,
which
is
understandable.
the
plaintiffs
don't
want
to
have
to
prove
all
of
the
other
--
you
wouldn't
think
they
would
want
to
prove
all
the
other
facts.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
sure.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
right.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
in
the
fda
sense,
that's
true.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--i
would
just
say
that
adverse
event
reports
are
not
limited
to
what
qualifies
for
the
fda,
certainly
not
by
the
way
the
case
is--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--litigated.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
yes.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
yes.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
that's
true.
but
there's
a
broader
point
about
the
fda,
which
i
think
is
underlying
your
question
and
justice
kagan's
question,
which
is
i
don't
even
think
it's
true
that
the
fda
really
requires
reasonable
evidence.
they
have
broad
discretion
and
should
have
broad
discretion.
nobody
is
contesting
that.
but
the
question
is,
again
ex
ante,
before
you
know
what
the
fda
might
do,
before
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
the
fda
to
act.
remember,
the
fda
didn't
act
for
5
years.
the
fda
didn't
act
on
the
basis
of
what
matrixx
was
aware
of
at
the
time,
and
so,
that
can't
be
the
standard,
the
idea
that
the
fda
may
some
day
act.
statistical
significance
--
the
question
of
statistical
significance
is
presented
in
this
case
to
the
extent
the
courts
below
were
arguing
about
and
the
plaintiffs
were
arguing
about
whether
or
not
the
small
number
of
raw
adverse
event
reports
tell
you
anything
meaningful.
the
real
standard
--
the
--
the
case
got
developed
in
the
briefing
here
when
the
plaintiffs
came
back
and
said,
well,
there's
more
to
it
and
there
can
be
more
to
it,
and
that,
of
course,
is
true,
but
the
standard
has
to
be
reliability.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well,
there's
a
reference
--
i
mean,
there's
a
--
1999
was
the
first
call
from
dr.
hirsch,
who
reported
one
patient.
there
is
a
discussion
with
dr.
linschoten
about
one
other
patient.
and
there
were
some
reports
--
nobody
is
disputing
that
there
were
some
reports
out
there.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
no,
because
a
doctor
doesn't
have
unique
expertise
in
diagnosing
causation.
a
doctor
--
if
you
have
a
sore
knee,
a
doctor
is
qualified
to
tell
you
--
to
diagnose
the
fact
that
your
sore
knee
is
the
product
of
bone
cancer.
a
doctor
is
not
qualified
to
tell
you
why
you
got
bone
cancer,
and
that's
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
return
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
the
role
of
scienter
here,
which
i
think
absolutely
is
critical
as
this
court
emphasized
recently
in
the
merck
v.
reynolds
case.
mr.
frederick
correctly,
i
think,
conceded
that
there
has
to
be
a
scientifically
plausible
basis.
and
what
you're
talking
about
here
is
the
company's
knowledge
of
a
scientifically
plausible
basis.
and
he
has
to
make
that
concession
in
this
case
because
of
what
is
alleged
to
be
the
material
omission.
the
material
omission
is
not
knowledge
of
dubious
scientific
--
medical
claims,
it's
not
that
we
get
one
phone
call
from
a
doctor.
the
real
material
omission
is
that
the
adverse
event
reports
told
matrixx
that
zicam
causes
anosmia.
that's
ultimately
the
fact
that
--
that
matrixx
supposedly
did
not
disclose.
so
there
has
to
be
a
basis
for
believing
that
--
there
has
to
be
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
sufficient
to
establish
matrixx
actually
knew
that
zicam
causes
anosmia
and
yet
willfully
refused
to
tell
investors
that
fact,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
complaint
like
that.
there's
not
--
you're
not
talking
about
a
case
where
there
was
a
failure
to
disclose
the
doctor's
completely
dubious
untested
claim.
it's
not
a
case
--
it's
not
the
satan
case
where
you're
talking
about
a
media
splash,
a
known
fact
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
major
media
splash
and
the
company
knows
for
a
fact
that
that
splash
is
going
to
have
the
adverse
effect
on
the
stock.
there
is
not
even
a
claim
here--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--well,
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
if
the
claim
was
about,
you
know,
the
consumer
sales,
you
would
need
an
allegation
in
the
case
that
consumer
product
sales
were
actually
affected.
there's
no
allegation
like
that,
and
the
truth
is
they
weren't.
and
so
you're
not
talking
about
falsifying
any
prior
claim.
there's
not
even
an
allegation
that
that
happened,
your
honor.
second,
with
respect
to
the
--
the
statement,
as
i
was
discussing
with
justice
ginsburg
in
the
beginning
part
of
the
argument,
the
statement
was
what
the
scientific
panel
was
addressing
primarily
was
jafek's
claim
that
zicam
causes
anosmia,
and
the
company
said
accurately
that
that
is
completely
unfounded
and
misleading
because
there
is
no
scientific
support
for
it.
you
can't
go
out
and
claim
that
zicam
causes
anosmia
unless
you
have
a
scientific
basis
for
that
and
the
scientific
panel
was
saying
that
isn't
true.
so
the
question
is
whether
you
can
draw
an
inference
of
scienter
from
the
fact
that
--
from
what's
alleged
here,
and
there
is
simply
no
basis
for
an
allegation,
supportable
allegation
that
the
company
knew
it
causes
anosmia
and
nevertheless
refused
to
tell
investors
that.
thank
you.
