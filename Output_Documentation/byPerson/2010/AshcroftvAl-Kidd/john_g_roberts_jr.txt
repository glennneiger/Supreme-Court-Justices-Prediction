chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
10-98,
ashcroft
v.
al-kidd.
general
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
gelernt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
problem,
and
it's,
i
think,
the
problem
that
i
think
whren
highlighted
is
that
the
--
the
allegation
can
so
readily
be
made
in
every
case
under
the
material
witness
statute
is
that
this
is
one
of
those
bad
intent
cases,
and
the
case
has
to
proceed
so
that
we
can
prove
that.
one
of
the
ways
we
prove
that
is
by
asking
everybody
who
is
involved
in
the
process.
why
did
you
do
this?
what
was
your
intent?
i
mean,
the
whole
purpose
of
whren
is
to
make
sure
that
kind
of
stuff
doesn't
happen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
every
time
the
prosecutor
elects
not
to
call
one
of
these
witnesses
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
you
would
have
a
claim
that
this
wasn't
designed
to
elicit
testimony?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
were
writing
a
law
review
article,
you
might
have
done
that.
but
we're
talking
about
an
officer.
i
think
the
first
thing
you
would
do
is
say,
well,
let
me
see
these
material
witness
statute
cases,
and
what
would
he
have
found?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but,
again,
you're
talking
about
the
officer,
he
reads
the
statute
and
then
doesn't
say,
well,
but
maybe
the
statute's
unconstitutional,
so
i
need
to
do
more
research?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
eight
--
eight
judges
taking
the
opposite
position
in
the
hearing
en
banc
below
were
just
being
unreasonable?
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
for
an
officer
making
this
determination
to
agree
with
eight
judges
from
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
we
said
in
wilson,
i'm
quoting,
judges
--
when
judges
disagree
on
a
constitutional
question,
it
is
unfair
to
subject
public
employees
to
money
damages
for
picking
the
losing
side
of
the
controversy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
agree
with
--
i
agree
with
that,
of
course,
but
at
the
same
time,
it
does
seem
that
you're
imposing
a
very
heavy
burden
on
the
officers
in
this
area
when
do
you
have
a
situation
where
eight
judges,
when
they
conduct
their
research,
come
out
the
other
way.
and
that
type
of
burden
is
particularly
heavy
when
you're
talking
about
if
they
guess
wrong,
it
comes
out
of
their
pocket.
and
if
i'm
the
officer
in
that
situation,
i
say,
well,
i'm
just
not
going
to
run
the
risk
of,
you
know,
having
to
sell
the
house
because
i
agreed
with
eight
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general,
you
have
10
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
