justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
light
of
these
restrictions,
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
the
question
that
i
understood
justice
scalia
to
be
asking.
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
obtaining
a
material
witness
warrant
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment
where
the
statutory
requirements,
and
in
particular
establishing
materiality,
are
met,
why
would
it
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
there's
absolute
immunity
when
a
prosecutor
seeks
a
material
witness
warrant?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
this
a
--
is
this
a
realistic
hypothetical
that
you've
posed?
now,
in
order
to
detain
someone
under
the
material
witness
statute,
that
person,
potential
witness,
must
have
material
testimony,
not
just
relevant
testimony,
material
testimony,
testimony
that
would
be
of
some
importance
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
so
your
hypothetical
is
a
situation
in
which
there
is
a
witness
and
this
witness
has
important
testimony
that
could
be
used
in
a
pending
criminal
case,
and
yet
the
prosecution
has
absolutely
no
interest
in
calling
that
person
as
a
witness.
how
often
is
that
going
to
arise?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
argument
is
that
the
constitution
does
not
allow
a
material
witness
to
be
detained,
so
long
as
the
witness
says
in
court
that
he
or
she
will
show
up
for
trial,
no
matter
how
much
evidence
there
is
that
this
person
poses
a
great
risk
of
flight?
if
the
person
says
in
court,
i
will
be
there,
that's
the
end
of
it,
the
person
cannot
be
detained?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
might
turn
out--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
don't
think
that
an
official
reading
all
this
court's
cases
saying
subjective
motivation
is
not
proper
in
determining
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
would
be
able
to
think
that
this
would
apply
here,
too?
subjective
motivation
doesn't
count
here;
what
counts
is
whether
there's
--
there
are
objective
criteria
that
would
permit
the
detention?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
seem
to
acknowledge
that
in
--
a
dual
motive
case
would
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
or
wouldn't
necessarily
violate
the
fourth
amendment;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that
a
reasonable
official
would
appreciate,
well,
it's
okay
for
me
to
have
a
dual
motive,
but
i
have
to
stop
and
think:
is
my
interest
in
investigating
this
individual
further
the
but-for
cause
of
my
desire
to
get
a
material
witness
warrant?
do
you
think
that
was
apparent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
did
you
allege
that
the
desire
to
detain
was
the
sole
motive
for
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
bivens
action?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
under
what
theory
is
the
history
of
immunity
at
some
point
in
the
19th
century
relevant
to
the
scope
of
the
immunity
that
should
be
available
in
a
--
in
a
bivens
action?
what's
the
theory
for
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
that
make
any
sense?
i
can
understand
it
with
respect
to
1983,
on
the
theory
that
when
congress
passed
the
predecessor
of
that
statute
it
implicitly
intended
to
adopt
the
immunities
that
were
available
at
the
time;
but
when
this
court
invented
the
bivens
claim
--
in
when
--
1971
or
whatever
--
that
the
court
--
the
court
was
--
committed
itself
to
recognizing
only
those
immunities
that
were
available
at
the
time
when
1983
was
adopted?
