mr.
lee
gelernt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
dunaway,
this
court
emphatically
reaffirmed
the
bedrock
fourth
amendment
principle
that
a
criminal
suspect
may
not
be
arrested,
absent
probable
cause
to
believe
there
has
been
a
law
violated.
the
rule
is
fundamental
to
our
traditions,
is
widely
viewed
as
a
defining
feature
of
our
country,
and
has
been
steadfastly
protected
by
this
court
for
more
than
2
centuries
in
both
good
and
bad
times.
the
material
witness
statute
represents
a
dramatic
departure
to
the
rule,
allowing
the
arrest
of
uncharged,
innocent,
even
cooperative
people.
if
a
material
witness
arrest
is
constitutional,
it
can
only
be
because
its
purpose
is
to
secure
testimony
and
not
to
preventively
detain
and
investigate
the
witness
himself.
mr.
lee
gelernt
justice
scalia,
we
are
not
pressing
that
argument.
i
would
say
that
based
on
the
legal
historian's
brief
there
is
a
strong
argument
to
be
made
that
it
is
not
constitutional,
with
respect
at
least
to
cooperative
witnesses.
the
statute
the
framers
enacted
in
1789
would
not
allow
the
arrest
of
any
witness
unless
they
came
voluntarily
before
the
magistrate
and
refused
to
even
promise
to
return.
not
even
a
surety
or
a
--
a
surety
or
a
bond
was
allowed.
so
we
do
think
there
is
a
strong
argument,
but
we
are
not
pressing
that
argument.
our
argument
is
that
it
cannot
be
used
for
ulterior
purposes.
and
i
just
want
to
pick
up,
if
i
can,
with
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
that
he
posed
to
the
government,
which
is
of
course
our
hypothetical.
the
government
started
out
this
case
throughout
the
lower
courts
and
in
the
opening
brief
saying
purpose
is
wholly
irrelevant.
this
is
whren,
even
though
whren
is
probable
cause
to
believe
a
law
has
been
violated;
this
is
whren,
purpose
is
wholly
irrelevant.
we
posed
a
hypothetical
which
we
actually
think
is
this
case
and
is
consistent
with
our
factual
allegations,
that
the
sole
reason
this
arrest
was
made
was
not
to
secure
testimony
but
to
preventively
detain
and
investigate
someone
for
whom
there
was
no
probable
cause
or
violation
of
the
law.
that
is
--
is
a
difficult
situation
i
think
to
reconcile
with
whren,
i
think
an
impossible
situation
to
reconcile
with
whren,
or
with
the
text
or
history
of
this
statute.
the
government
has
now
come
back
and
trying
to
have
it
both
ways
and
saying,
well,
the
statute
wouldn't
naturally
allow
that.
but
if
purpose
is
--
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
if
purpose
is
truly
irrelevant
why
they
want
to
make
the
arrest,
the
government
should
have
answered
"that
would
be
fine.
"
"the
only
things
we
need
to
satisfy
are
the
objective
components
of
materiality
and
impracticability.
"
mr.
lee
gelernt
well,
justice
alito,
i
--
i
think
a
few
points,
one
is
just
as
an
initial
matter.
the
statute
has
not
actually
been
interpreted
to
go
beyond
relevance,
in
the
way
you're
posing
it.
interestingly,
earlier
statutes
actually
said
the
testimony
needed
to
be
necessary.
and
so,
that's
--
that's
actually
an
important
watering
down.
but
putting
that
aside
for
the
moment,
we
think
that
what
--
it
--
it
did
happen
in
this
case,
it
happened
after
9-11,
i
think
that
goes
to
the
crux
of
our
case
here.
we
are
not
trying
to
fiddle
with
the
use
of
the
material
witness
statute
in
the
every
day
context,
and
i
think
that's
the
point
the
federal
prosecutor's
brief
is
making.
what
we
are
saying
is
simply
that
the
principle
has
to
be
that
if
you
do
encounter
that
extreme
case,
this
court
should
not
bless
the
situation
where
it
literally
can
be
used
as
a
preventive--
mr.
lee
gelernt
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
let
me
--
let
me
say
that
i
think
i
--
as
i
understand
whren,
i
obviously
don't
want
to
tell
the
court
about
its
own
cases,
but
is
that
it
was
drawing
a
conceptual
line,
that
the
first
point
about
whren,
and
i
think
the
fundamental
point,
was
the
conceptual
point
that
as
the
whren
court
put
it,
only
an
undiscerning
reader
would
conflate
cases
in
which
there
was
probable
cause
of
a
violation
of
the
law
with
cases
in
which
there
wasn't.
so
i
think
the
whren
court
is
not
saying
we
wouldn't
look
at
purpose.
i
think
that's
the
teaching
of
the
special
needs
cases.
now,
to
your
practical
question
about
why
would
this
be
hard
to
allege?
i
actually
think
that
this
is
one
of
those
unique
situations
which
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
allege.
take
the
government's
cases,
for
example,
that
they've
cited,
like
daniels
and
betts,
the
material
witness
cases,
you
have
witnesses
being
arrested,
not
showing
up
for
trial.
as
the
court
of
appeals
made
clear
in
those
cases,
they
were
the
main
witnesses,
not
showing
up
on
the
day
of
the
trial
or
right
before
trial.
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
for
those
witnesses
to
turn
around
and
say
the
only
reason
i
was
arrested
was
for
investigative
purposes.
and
i
think
that
on
top
of
the
fact
that
this
statute
is
used
very
rarely,
i
mean
what
we
have
pointed
out
is
other
than
in
immigration
cases,
which
the
person
is
already
subject
to
custody,
there
are
only
a
few
hundred
each
year.
and
again,
i
think
what
the
green
brief
is
saying
by
the
federal
prosecutors
is,
look,
the
settled
understanding
of
this
statute
among
line
prosecutors
has
always
been,
you
use
it
to
secure
testimony.
maybe
there's
a
windfall
in
the
back
of
your
mind
that
this
person
might
be
a
suspect,
but
you
certainly
can't
use
it
where
you
have
no
intention
of
using
the
testimony.
i
think
then
the
limitations
on
this
statute
become
meaningless.
i
mean,
take--
mr.
lee
gelernt
--no,
no,
we
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
--
i
think
what
we
have
--
we
have
said
is
that
calling
the
witness
or
not
calling
the
witness
can't
be
determinative.
i
think
one
reason
is
you
wouldn't
want
to
create
a
perverse
incentive
to
have
prosecutors
simply
call
the
witness
just
to
cover
themselves.
so
i
think
you
would
have
to
allege
much
more,
and
i
think
that's
what
we
have
done.
i
think
there
is
an
entire
set
of
allegations
with
respect
to
mr.
al-kidd,
and
they
fit
a
national
pattern.
and
i
would
importantly
say
in
the
questions
presented,
the
government
raised
an
iqbal
claim
as
to
plausibility
only
as
to
a
small
part
of
this
case
which
is
no
longer
part
of
the
case,
which
is,
was
mr.
ashcroft
involved
in
the
specific
statements
in
this
specific
affidavit.
they
did
not
allege
that
the
allegations
of
a
pretextual
policy
were
implausible.
so
it
is
not
before
this
court,
it
is
not
a
question
presented,
and
i
think
it
is
telling
that
the
government
didn't
raise
it.
they
are
sitting
on
all
the
information
about
what
happened
after
9-11
as
a
policy
matter,
and
they
did
not
claim
it
was
implausible.
mr.
lee
gelernt
yes,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
apologize
if
i
wasn't
clear.
that
what
the
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
showed
and
what
the
statistics
also
show
is
that
roughly
92
percent
of
the
cases
are
immigration
cases,
where
the
person
is
already
subject
to
custody,
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
need
to
use
it
in
that
pretextual
way.
so
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
few
hundred
each
year
throughout
the
country,
and
again
when
it's
used
properly,
it's
going
to
be
virtually
impossible
to
allege
something
like
this.
mr.
lee
gelernt
we
have
--
we
have
looked
for
those,
justice
kennedy.
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
them.
what
we
do
know
about
the
states,
though
is
that
more
than
30
of
the
states
have
statutes
that
are
much
more
restrictive
than
the
federal
government,
because
what
they
do
is
they
follow
what
the
framers
did
in
1789,
which
is
to
say
the
witness
has
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
comply,
and
that's
what
the
framers
did.
you
have
to
ask
the
witness
if
they
will
continue
to
comply.
if
they
won't
--
or
you
have
to
make
a
showing
of
why
it's
impossible
to
ask
them.
so,
i
think
in
many
states
it
won't
be
a
problem.
i
think
actually,
you
know,
the
state
issue
is
an
important
one
because
what
the
federal
government
is
arguing
here
is,
of
course,
well,
our
prosecutors
are
very
well
supervised.
well,
that
--
that
doesn't
take
into
account
if
there
is
a
deliberate
attempt
to
misuse
it.
but
i
also
think
what
we're
looking
at
are
states,
local
counties,
cities
where
there
may
not
be
the
resources
necessary
to
put
checks
on,
and
what
the
government's
asking
is
for
this
court
to
hold
that
as
long
as
you
can
make
the
minimal
showings
of
impracticability
and
materiality,
which
don't
even
require
the
evidence
to
be
important
or
that
the
witness
be
uncooperative,
you
then
can
have
any
purpose
you
want.
so
you
could
have
states,
cities,
local
counties
saying
every
member
of
this
gang
or
every
member
of
this
business
must
know
some
information
about
the
person
that's
been
indicted.
mr.
lee
gelernt
do
i
think
the
constitution
requires
that?
mr.
lee
gelernt
i
think
it
probably
does,
but
we
are
not
taking
a
position
on
that.
i
mean,
what
we
are
basically
saying
is
that
it
is
out
of
whack
historically.
it
wasn't
until
the
mid
1900s
where
that
could
happen,
where
even
if
they
said
they
would
come
back,
you
could
hold
them.
so
i
think
it's
out
of
whack
historically,
and
there
may
be
a
real
constitutional
argument.
we
are
not
pressing
it.
we
are
simply
saying
that
if
it's
used
for
its
proper
purpose,
then
we
are
going
to
assume
it's
constitutionality,
which
the
ninth
circuit
did,
but
it
can't
be
that
it
can
be
used
as
a
preventive
detention.
and
i
think
any
reasonable
official
--
and
i
want
to
go
to
the
qualified
immunity
if
i
could
--
would
have
seen
that,
because
i
think
the
analysis
would
have
been
the
following.
you
would
have
pulled
out
dunaway,
and
you
would
have
seen
that
you
need
probable
cause
to
arrest
someone,
probable
cause
of
wrongdoing.
and
you
would
have
then
said,
well,
we
don't
have
probable
cause
of
wrongdoing,
so
you
would
have
pulled
out
whren
then,
because
whren
talked
about
pretext.
what
whren
would
have
told
you
is
do
not
conflate
cases
in
which
there's
probable
cause
of
wrongdoing
with
cases
in
which
the
court
has
granted
an
exemption
from
the
probable
cause--
mr.
lee
gelernt
--well,
i
think
what
he
would
have
found,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
has
not
specifically
--
i
grant
that
it
has
not
specifically
ruled
on
the
fourth
amendment,
but
what
he
would
have
found
in
barry
and
the
other
cases,
is
that
the
court
repeatedly,
repeatedly
referred
to
statute
as
a
means
of
securing
testimony.
so
i
think
the
reasonable
official
would
have
said
to
themselves,
well,
it's
clear
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
i
don't
have
probable
cause,
but
maybe
the
statute
is
allowing
me
to
do
it.
now,
first
of
all,
it
statute
can't
authorize
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
but
putting
that
aside,
just
a--
mr.
lee
gelernt
--exactly,
your
honor.
and
i
think
what
the
research
would
have
been
done,
they
would
have
looked
at
barry
and
all
this
court's
other
cases
and
would
have
specifically
said
it's
to
secure
testimony,
and
then
i
think
a
reasonable
official
would
have
looked
at
the
text
of
the
statute,
everything
in
the
text
of
the
statute
is
about
securing
testimony,
including
the
deposition
requirement,
you
must
be
released
if
your
deposition
is
taken,
you
must
have
a
deposition.
all
of
those
things
do
not
suggest
--
if
the
government's
interests
could
be
simply
we
want
to
hold
this
person
because
for
preventive
detention
reasons,
none
of
the
statute
would
make
sense.
i
think
that
a
reasonable
official
could
not
have
turned
to
this
statute
and
said,
yes,
i'm
looking
at
the
statute,
and
it
seems
like
i
can
use
it
for
whatever
reason
i
want.
mr.
lee
gelernt
i
think,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
is
to
say
this
court
has
--
has
never
made
determinant
of
whether
there
are
dissents.
i
mean,
take
the
brogue
in
this
court,
two
justices
of
this
court
dissented
on
merits
and
yet
you
still
found
that
the
law
was
clearly
established.
mr.
lee
gelernt
i
mean,
but
i
think
brogue
goes
the
other
way.
ultimately,
all
i
can
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
i
think
that
the
--
the
fact
that
there
were
dissenters
can't
be
dispositive,
and
ultimately
this--
mr.
lee
gelernt
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
--
you
know,
of
course,
i'm
not
sure
it
will
actually
come
out
of
their
pocket,
but
i
get
the
crux
of
your
point.
i
do
think
ultimately,
though,
that
this
is
a
situation
where
a
reasonable
official
would
have
had
to
say
to
themselves:
i
can
use
this
as
preventative
detention.
because
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
our
position
and
how
narrow
it
is.
we
would
concede,
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
that
if
they
wanted
to
use
this
for
dual
motives,
then
there
would
have
been
a
real
question
there.
if
they
said,
look,
we
want
the
testimony,
that's
what
the
statute
talks
about,
but
we
also
hope
that
maybe
something
else
will
come
out
of
it,
that's
a
closed
question.
but
if
they
would
have
said
to
themselves,
which
is
all
we're
saying
this
case
is
about,
is:
look,
we
don't
want
this
testimony.
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
there's
clear,
objective
evidence.
we
don't
want
to
use
this
testimony,
perhaps
it's
counterproductive
in
our
case;
we're
not
going
to
use
this
testimony,
but
we
would
like
to
hold
the
person.
i
think
that
is
very
difficult
for
a
reasonable
official
to
say
to
themselves,
this
statute
grants
me
preventive
detention
powers.
i
mean,
i
think
you
would
be
looking
at
a
statute
going
back
to
1789
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
commented
on
that
is
only
about
testimony.
you
would
be
saying
to
yourself,
this
statute
allows
me
to
engage
in
preventive
detention
even
though
congress
has
never
passed
a
statute
like
that,
congress
specifically
rejected
preventive
detention
powers--
mr.
lee
gelernt
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
alito,
respectfully.
i
think
when
you
pulled
out
whren,
which,
of
course,
is
this
court's
landmark
decision
on
pretext
--
whren
could
not
have
been
clearer.
the
court
specifically
said
only
an
undiscerning
reader
would
conflate
the
two.
and
i
think
the
conceptual
point
whren
was
making
is
straightforward.
the
fourth
amendment
says
you
need
probable
cause
or
a
violation
of
the
law
to
arrest
someone.
if
the
government
wants
to
walk
in
and
ask
for
an
exemption
from
that
standard
and
says,
the
reason
we
want
the
exemption
is
because
of
the
purpose
of
the
arrest,
then
the
court
in
whren
said,
well,
then
they
must
adhere
to
the
purpose.
otherwise,
it's
simply
an
end-run
about
the
standard
of
probable
cause.
i
mean,
consider
two
cases--
mr.
lee
gelernt
--yes,
justice
scalia,
but
i
think
--
well,
the
terry
--
the
terry
stops,
i
think
we
put
to
one
side,
because
as
the
court
in
terry
said
and
as
this
court
has
interpreted
terry,
those
were
because
those
were
not
full-scale
arrests
and
the
administrative
--
sorry.
mr.
lee
gelernt
absolutely,
and
those
all
fall
into
the
special
needs
category,
and
those
were
cases
you,
your
honor,
in
whren
distinguished
as
conceptually
different
than
when
there's
probable
cause
of
a
violation
of
law,
because
what
you
yourself
said
in
whren
was:
look,
the
government
is
asking
for
an
exemption
from
the
traditional
fourth
amendment
standard
and
they're
saying
the
reason
we
want
the
exemption
is
because
of
the
purpose
of
our
search.
you
said,
well,
then,
of
course
we're
going
to
hold
the
government
to
that
purpose.
they
can't
tell
us,
look,
we
don't
want
to
meet
the
fourth
amendment
standard
because
of
the
purpose
of
what
we're
doing,
but
then
turn
around
and
not
adhere
to
the
purpose.
and
so
if
you
had
two
cases,
one
where
there's
probable
cause
of
wrongdoing
and
another
case
where
there
wasn't,
the
judge
would
say
fine
to
the
first
one
and
then
he
would
say
to
you,
well,
the
second
one,
you
don't
have
probable
cause.
the
only
thing
the
government
could
say
at
that
point
was,
well,
that's
true,
but
we're
not
trying
to
investigate
or
prosecute
the
person
as
in
dunaway.
we
have
a
different
purpose.
maybe
it's
administrative.
maybe
it's
to
secure
testimony.
maybe
it's
a
roadblock.
maybe
it's
something
else.
and
then
if
the
court
said,
well,
fine,
then
go
ahead
and
do
that
search
on
less
than
probable
cause,
if
that's
your
purpose,
you
couldn't
turn
around
then
and
not
--
and
then
not
adhere
to
that
purpose.
i
mean,
i
think
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
is
that--
mr.
lee
gelernt
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
gelernt
i
think
it
actually
is,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is
because
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it
actually
gives
cushion
to
the
reasonable
official,
because
i
think
once
you
are
saying
we
want
to
secure
testimony,
it
might
be
very
difficult,
as
the
chief
justice
was
pointing
out,
to
say,
well,
how
i
do
know
if
i
could
have
ulterior
motives
or
not?
that
might
be
a
very
difficult
situation.
but
i
think
a
reasonable
official
--
this
court's
proposition
that
this
court
would
have
to
--
would
have
to
bless,
based
on
the
allegations
here
are,
the
official
said,
look,
we
think
we
can
show
materiality
and
practicability
because
mr.
al-kidd
is
taking
a
trip,
he
is
being
cooperative,
but
he
is
taking
a
trip
and
he
works
for
the
same
charity.
we
do
not
want
the
testimony.
we
can't
use
the
testimony
in
this
trial.
the
only
reason
we
want
to
do
it
is
to
hold
him,
and
we
don't
have
probable
cause
of
a
violation
of
the
law.
i
think
any
reasonable
official
would
have
understood
that
as
preventive
detention,
and
there--
mr.
lee
gelernt
--that
goes
to
the
crux
of,
i
think,
what
is
going
on
here.
we
have
said
that
both
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
materiality
as
well
as
other
parts
of
the
statute
would
deal
with
it
precisely.
the
government's
opening
brief
and
throughout
the
lower
courts
said,
no,
it
doesn't
matter
if
you're
going
to
use
the
testimony
or
not
or
we
have
any
intention.
we
posed
that
hypothetical
in
our
brief.
the
government
came
back
and
said,
well,
maybe
that
could
be
done
with
materiality.
if
the
government
was
going
to
stick
to
their
position,
their
conceptual
position,
they
would
have
come
back
and
said,
look,
the
objective
components
of
materiality
and
of
practicability
have
been
satisfied,
because
he's
taking
a
trip
and
he
worked
for
the
same
charity,
and
who
cares
whether
--
so
if
the
court
is
prepared
to
put
a
limit
on,
you
have
to
use
this
for
its
stated
purpose,
testimony,
that's
all
we're
asking
for.
i
mean,
the
case
has
changed
now
because
of
the
concession
that
the
government's
made
on
pages
bottom
of
15,
top
of
16,
where
they're
now
saying,
yeah,
that
is
a
tough
situation,
and
maybe
we
can
deal
with
that
through
the
statute.
but
that's
all
we're
saying.
the
ninth
circuit
understood
this
as
a
sole
motive
case.
the
government
understood
it
in
their
cert
petition
and
in
their
brief
to
this
court
as
a
sole
motive
case.
we
have
said
we
think
the
analytical
test
is
a
but-for,
but
we're
prepared
to
go
with
sole
motive,
and
our
allegations,
our
factual
allegations,
are
consistent.
in
the
proposition,
we
are
simply
saying,
we
don't
think
this
court
can
bless
it.
you
satisfy
practicability
in
some
objective
way;
you
don't
care
whether
you're
going
to
use
the
testimony,
you
may
have
no
use
for
it,
but
it's
an
end-run
around
locking
people
up.
mr.
lee
gelernt
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
clearest
allegations
are
at
111
and
112
and
154
of
our
complaint,
in
the
joint
appendix.
what
we
said
is
it
was
not
to
secure
testimony.
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
certainly
understood
it
that
way
at
pages
--
i
apologize
--
25a
and
40a
of
the
opinion.
and
the
government,
in
its
cert
petition
and
its
brief,
understood
it
that
way
in
saying,
we
don't
know
how
the
ninth
circuit
would
deal
with
a
mixed
motive
case,
clearly
suggesting
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
a
sole
motive
case;
and
so
again,
all
we
are
saying
is
it
cannot
be
that
this
statute
be
transformed
into
a
preventive
detention
statute,
and
i
think
particularly
so
because
the
government
after
9-11
specifically
--
as
the
green
brief
notes
--
specifically
asked
congress
for
preventive
detention
power,
and
that
power
was
denied.
what
they
granted
was
a
very
limited
7-day
hold
only
for
noncitizens.
and
so
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
in
many
respects
--
at
a
macro
level
is
a
separation
of
powers
case
as
much
as
a
fourth
amendment.
i
think
it's
not
--
it's
not
dissimilar
to
the
dialogue
this
court
has
been
having
in
the
guantanamo
cases
with,
look,
you
need
to
go
beyond
the
fourth
amendment;
if
you
think
you
need
such
a
fundamental
change
to
our
country's
traditions,
congress
is
going
to
have
to
take
the
first
step,
we'll
look
at
it
and
there
will
be
a
back
and
forth.
but
here
what
happened
was
the
preventive
detention
powers
were
denied
and
yet
the
government
still
went
ahead
and
used
the
material
witness
statute.
and
again,
i
can't
stress
enough
that
the
government
did
not
raise
an
iqbal
claim
as
to
the
plausibility
of
these
allegations.
only
now
in
the
reply
brief
where
they're
--
they're
trying
to
address
a
sole
motive
situation,
or
a
but-for,
which
is
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
address,
the
government
has
now
said
the
allegations
are
implausible.
i
think
that
in
many
situations
--
you
know,
with
the
absolute
immunity
point,
if
i
could
just
turn
to
that
for
a
second
--
the
history,
as
you
said,
justice
kennedy,
the
government
has
conceded
they
don't
have
a
case
on
their
side.
we
have
plenty
of
cases
in
which,
as
the
historians'
brief
points
out,
and
as
our
brief
points
out,
in
which
there
was
not
immunity
for
the
arrest
of
a
--
for
the
arrest
of
a
witness,
which
is
very
different
than
calling
a
witness,
justice
sotomayor.
and
what
we
are
talking
about
here
also
is
the
government's
burden.
so
i
don't
think
that's
something
we
could
have
--
we
could
have
waived,
especially
since
the
ninth
circuit
addressed
it
and
put
the
government
on
notice
that
the
government
came
forward
with
no
historical
evidence;
and
it's
not
inconsistent
with
warrants
generally.
as
this
court
made
clear
in
malley,
it
surveyed
the
history
of
arrest
warrants
and
said,
look,
arrest
warrants,
there's
no
history;
we're
not
going
to
grant
absolute
immunity
for
arrest
warrants.
in
burns,
justice
scalia
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
history
with
respect
to
search
warrants,
and
i
think
the
history
with
respect
to
material
witness
warrants
is
even
clearer.
so
what
we're
talking
about
is
no
history;
we're
talking
about
a
fairly
ancillary
and
rarely
used
process
to
the
criminal
justice
system,
and
one
we're
talking
about
where
there's
sort
of
a
unique
confluence
of
factors
where
you
have
someone
who
is
not
the
defendant
in
the
trial,
who
is
a
third
party,
and
their
liberty
is
being
deprived;
and
it's
the
type
of
statute
that
can
be
abused.
i
mean,
i
think
the
government's
whole
point
is
it's
a
dual
--
it's
a
dual
motive
type
statute;
and
so
that
because
it
can
be
inherently
abused,
there
has
to
be
some
checks
on
it.
and
this
court
has
never
said
that
you
would
have
absolute
immunity
for
all
prosecutors
in
all
cases.
we
are
certainly
not
raising
a
motive
case
with
respect
to
absolute
immunity.
what
we
are
simply
applying
is
the
court's
test
in
absolute
immunity,
which
is
the
functional
approach,
you
have
to
make
that
threshold
determination
about
whether
something
is
investigative
or
not;
and
i
think
that's
the
teaching
of
buckley.
take
two
witness
interviews.
they're
the
same
act,
but
the
prosecutor
clearly
can
be
engaged
in
interviews
for
different
reasons.
in
buckley,
it
happened
to
be
on
those
facts
the
court
believed
it
was
investigative,
based
on
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
but
what
if
it
were
2
days
before
the
presentment
to
the
grand
jury?
it's
likely
the
prosecutor
would
have
assumed
he
had
probable
cause
at
that
point
and
was
prepping
the
witnesses.
those
are
two
acts,
but
you
have
to
look
behind
them.
i
think
there's
no
way
around
looking
behind.
the
alternative,
the
flip
side
of
what
the
government's
asking,
is:
rigidly
categorize
every
single
act
a
prosecutor
may
undertake
in
this
country
and
say
it's
either
wholly
investigatory
or
wholly
prosecutorial.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
difficult
test.
i
think
there's
no
reason
why
district
courts
can't
make
an
initial
determination.
i
think
here
in
particular,
judge
--
was
in
a
unique
position
to
make
the
determination.
he
sat
at
the
underlying
trial
of
al-hussayen,
so
he
knew
what
testimony
and
what
was
going
on.
he--
mr.
lee
gelernt
--no,
your
honor.
and
i
--
i
--
justice
scalia,
i
apologize
if
my
argument
was
going
beyond.
mr.
lee
gelernt
i
think
what's
going
on
here
is
there's
a
unique
set
of
factors
with
respect
to
material
witness,
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
history
with
respect
to
both
material
witness
arrests
and
warrants
generally,
and
i
think
there's
been
no
counter-history
by
the
government.
i
think
back--
mr.
lee
gelernt
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
gelernt
well,
your
honor,
i
think
--
i
don't
know
that
i
have
an
independent
first
principles
theory.
i
think
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
you
will
keep
the
immunities
coterminous
and
you
will
look
to
the
history
in
both
cases.
so
that's
the
butz
case.
mr.
lee
gelernt
i
think,
you
know,
part
of
what
the
court's
answer
is,
it's
a
practical
concern.
that
it's
just
too
difficult
to
have
different
immunities,
and
the
court
--
so
the
court
has
repeatedly
reaffirmed
that,
and
i
think
from
a
policy
standpoint,
a
practical
standpoint,
it's
felt
that
that's
the
right
analysis,
and
there
has
to
be
some
way
to
tether
the
immunity
analysis;
and
history
is
ultimately,
i
think
--
what
the
court
has
said
it's
a
necessary
though
not
sufficient,
and
that
once
you
sort
of
unmoor
it
from
history,
it
becomes
very
difficult
to
keep
the
two.
so
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
--
a
statute
that
has
enormous
consequences.
it's
third
parties
who
have
been
cooperative,
even,
who
have
done
nothing
wrong,
that
end
up
in
jail,
and
to
say
that
there
is
going
to
be
absolute
immunity
is
very
dangerous.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
thumb
has
to
be
on
the
scale
against
absolute
immunity.
that's
an
extraordinary
protection,
and
if
there's
anywhere
where
there
needs
to
not
be
complete
insulation,
it
would
be
where
you
have
third
parties,
and
--
who
are
going
to
jail.
the
only
other
case,
prosecutorial
immunity
case
this
court
has
had
where
it
was
a
third
party
and
not
the
actual
defendant
was
mitchell,
and
the
court
denied
absolute
immunity.
all
the
other
cases,
some
of
which
you
have
denied
absolute
immunity,
some
of
which
you
have
granted,
it's
been
the
defendant
in
the
full
judicial
process.
here
we're
talking
about
third
parties
after
9-11
who
repeatedly
went
to
jail.
i
think
the
allegations
are
very
clear
that
it's
at
least
but-for
--
we
think
sole
--
but
certainly
far
more
than
dual
motive.
people
were
held
--
half
the
people
were
held
more
than
30
days,
even
though
the
statutory
presumption
is
10
days.
many
people
were
held
for
months.
they
were
arrested
at
gunpoint.
they
were
not
immunized;
half
the
people
were
never
called
to
testify.
it
went
on
in
cities
all
over
the
country,
people
being
held
under
horrendous
conditions
for
long
periods
of
time,
interrogated
about
their
own
activities.
