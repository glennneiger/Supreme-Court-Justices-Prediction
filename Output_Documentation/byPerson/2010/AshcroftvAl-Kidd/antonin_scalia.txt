justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
whether
your
second
reason
doesn't
boil
down
to
saying
that
it
makes
very
little
difference
whether
--
whether
ashcroft
is
--
is
held
immune
by
absolute
immunity
or
by
qualified
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
--
once
you
say
that
--
that
motive
is
not
introducible
with
regard
to
the
qualified
immunity
question,
and
once
you
say
that
he's
using
a
witness
subpoena,
and
you
can't
look
behind
it
as
to
whether
he
was
abusing
it
for
some
other
purpose,
is
there
any
difference
between
absolute
and
qualified
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
the
--
i
thought
the
argument,
rather,
was
that
this
is
not
as
close
to
the
core
of
the
prosecutorial
function
as
some
of
the
other
functions
to
which
we
have
given
absolute
immunity,
and
since
it's
so
dangerous,
since
there
is
such
potential
for
abuse,
we
shouldn't
confer
absolute
immunity
on
this
particular
conduct.
but
i
don't
understand
why
if
we
agree
with
you
on
qualified
immunity,
there
is
any
difference
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
prosecution
already
pending
when
this
--
when
this
warrant
was
issued?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
see
how
that
would
make
any
difference
to
the
--
at
least
to
the
absolute
immunity
question.
you
wouldn't
assert
that
there
is
absolute
immunity
if
there's
a
statute
such
as
this,
but
there
is
not
if
there
isn't.
i
mean,
either
this
is
core
prosecutorial
function
for
which
he
can't
be
sued
or
it
isn't.
so
what
difference
does
this
statute
make
as
far
--
as
far
as
absolute
immunity
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
for
us
to
agree
with
you
on
absolute
immunity,
we
--
we
would
have
to
believe
that
even
if
there
were
no
such
statute
and
if
a
prosecutor
simply
detained
somebody
as
a
material
witness
without
any
check
of
a
--
of
an
independent
magistrate,
he
would
be
immune?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
can't
look
behind
that,
right?
you
can't
look
behind
that?
if
the
--
if
the
judge
has
said
it's
material,
that's
the
end
of
it;
you
have
absolute
immunity,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
appeal
the
--
the
judge's
determination
that
--
that
it's
material?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
how
can
you
have
absolute
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
mean
at
the
time
it's
issued?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
if
you
didn't
have
--
again,
what
if
you
didn't
have
this
prescribed
judicial
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
are
procedures
set
forth
in
the
statute,
i'd
say
you
would
add,
which
you
think
are
not
necessary,
but
are
there
in
order
to
make
them
flinch
in
a
different
--
in
a
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
acknowledge
that
it
is
then
constitutional?
your
--
your
opening
comments
make
me
think
you
don't
even
acknowledge
that
it's
constitutional
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
say
you
need
probable
cause.
there
are
situations
where
you
can
conduct
a
search
without
probable
cause.
there's
the
terry
search.
there's
administrative
searches.
there's
a
lot
of
exceptions.
justice
antonin
scalia
administrative
searches,
automobile
searches,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
--
you're
going
way
beyond
what
i
thought
you
were
arguing.
you're
saying
you
always
have
to
make
that
determination
of
good
faith,
right?
in
--
in
all
cases,
including
when
the
prosecution
is
--
is
accused
of
--
of
bringing
a
prosecution
purely
for
harassment
purposes?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent
abdullah
al-kidd
alleges
that,
after
the
september
11th
terrorist
attacks,
then-attorney
general
john
ashcroft,
the
petitioner
here,
authorized
federal
officials
to
detain
terrorism
suspects
using
the
federal
material-witness
statute.
according
to
al-kidd,
this
pretextual
detention
policy,
holding
someone
that
you
suspect
of
a
crime
under
a
statute
that
enables
you
to
detain
material
witnesses,
led
to
his
material-witness
arrest
in
march
of
2003
as
he
was
boarding
a
plane
to
saudi
arabia.
two
days
earlier,
federal
officials
had
informed
a
magistrate
judge
that
if
al-kidd
boarded
his
flight
they
believed
information
"crucial"
to
the
prosecution
of
sami
omar
al-hussayen,
would
be
lost.
prosecutors
never
called
al-kidd
as
a
witness,
and
he
alleges
they
never
meant
--
never
meant
to
do
so.
after
his
release,
al-kidd
filed
this
suit
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
ashcroft's
alleged
policy.
ashcroft
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
--
oh
--
and
--
and
by
the
way,
if
you're
detained
as
a
material
witness
just
as
if
you're
detained
as
a
suspect,
you're
entitled
to
--
to
be
released
from
bond
and
--
and
that
indeed
did
occur
after
a
number
of
days.
but
after
his
release,
al-kidd
filed
this
suit
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
his
being
held
at
all.
ashcroft
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
based
on
absolute
immunity
and
qualified
immunity
which
the
district
court
denied.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed,
holding
that
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
pretextual
arrests
absent
probable
cause
of
criminal
wrongdoing,
and
that
ashcroft
could
not
claim
qualified
or
absolute
immunity.
we
granted
certiorari.
qualified
immunity
shields
a
government
official
from
money
damages
unless
two
things
are
present.
(1)
he
violated
a
statutory
or
constitutional
right,
and
(2)
that
right
was
"clearly
established"
at
the
time
of
the
challenged
conduct.
we
hold
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning
that
ashcroft
did
not
violate
al-kidd's
fourth
amendment
rights,
and
that
even
if
he
had,
the
wrongfulness
of
his
conduct
would
not
have
been
clearly
established
in
2003.
whether
a
detention
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
"is
predominantly
an
objective
inquiry."
we
ask
whether
the
--
these
are
quotes
from
our
cases.
we
ask
whether
"the
circumstances,
viewed
objectively,
justify
the
challenged
action."
this
approach
recognizes
that
efficient
and
evenhanded
application
of
the
law
demands
that
we
look
to
whether
the
arrest
is
objectively
justified,
rather
than
to
the
motive
of
the
arresting
officer.
two
"limited
exceptions"
to
this
rule
are
our
special-needs
and
administrative-search
cases,
where
"actual
motivations"
do
matter.
apart
from
those
categories
in
which
the
present
case
is
plainly
not
included,
we
have
almost
uniformly
rejected
invitations
to
probe
subjective
intent
of
the
arresting
officer.
the
court
of
appeals
nevertheless
read
one
of
our
vehicle
checkpoint
cases,
case
called
edmond,
to
give
purpose
a
more
extensive
role
in
fourth
amendment
analysis.
in
its
view,
edmond
established
that
"programmatic
purpose
is
relevant
to
fourth
amendment
analysis
of
programs
of
seizures
without
probable
cause."
that
was
mistaken.
it
was
not
the
absence
of
probable
cause
that
triggered
edmond's
invalidating-purpose
inquiry,
but
rather,
the
checkpoint's
failure
to
be
based
on
individualized
suspicion.
such
warrantless,
suspicionless
intrusions
are
far
removed
from
the
fact
here,
where
a
neutral
magistrate
judge
issued
a
warrant
authorizing
al-kidd's
arrest,
and
the
affidavit
accompanying
the
warrant
application
gave
individualized
reasons
to
believe
that
he
was
a
material
witness
who
would
soon
disappear.
a
warrant
based
on
individualized
suspicion,
in
fact
grants
more
protection
against
the
malevolent
and
the
incompetent
than
existed
in
most
of
our
cases
that
eschew
inquiries
into
intent.
even
assuming
--
contrarfactually
--
that
ashcroft's
alleged
detention
policy
violated
the
fourth
amendment,
he
deserves
qualified
immunity
anyway.
a
government
official's
conduct
violates
clearly
established
law
when,
at
the
time
of
the
challenged
conduct,
"the
contours
of
a
right
are
sufficiently
clear"
that
every
"reasonable
official
would
have
understood
that
what
he
is
doing
violates
that
right."
that's
a
quote
from
our
cases.
the
constitutional
question
in
this
case
falls
far
short
of
that
threshold.
at
the
time
of
al-kidd's
arrest,
not
a
single
judicial
opinion
had
held
that
pretext
could
render
an
objectively
reasonable
arrest
pursuant
to
a
material-witness
warrant
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
made
up
for
that
shortcoming
by
citing
a
district
court's
footnoted
dictum
suggesting
that
the
use
of
material
--
material-witness
warrants
to
detain
suspect
"is
an
illegitimate
use
of
the
statute"
and
mentioning
ashcroft
by
name.
we
find
that
reasoning
extraordinary.
the
footnoted
dictum
falls
far
short
of
what
is
necessary
to
clearly
establish
the
law
even
when
that
dictum
mentions
the
defendant
by
name.
the
court
of
appeals
also
found
clearly
established
law
lurking
in
the
broad
"history
and
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,"
and
in
several
prior
opinions
of
this
court.
as
to
the
former,
we
have
repeatedly
told
courts
--
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
particular
--
not
to
define
clearly
established
law
of
such
a
high
level
of
generality.
and
as
to
the
latter,
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
cherry-picked
the
aspects
of
our
opinions
that
gave
colorable
support
to
the
proposition
that
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
action
here
was
clearly
established
while
ignoring
numerous
statements
that
foreshadow
today's
fourth
amendment
holding.
we
have
held
the
qualified
immunity
protects
"all
but
the
plainly
incompetent
or
those
who
knowingly
violate
the
law."
ashcroft
deserves
neither
label
because
ashcroft
did
not
violate
clearly
established
law,
we
need
not
address
the
more
difficult
question
of
whether
he
enjoys
absolute
immunity.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
and
the
case
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
