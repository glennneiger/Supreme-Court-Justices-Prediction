justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
--
suppose
that
a
prosecutor
reads
the
statute,
there
must
be
an
affidavit
that
says
this
witness
is
material.
and
there
is
irrefutable
evidence
that
the
prosecutor
said
to
colleagues
and
others:
i
do
not
intend
to
try
this
person,
ever,
no
matter
what;
i
just
want
to
ask
him
questions.
in
that
case,
has
the
statute
been
violated
because
he
is
not
material?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
it's
this
case.
i'm
saying
it's
a
hypothetical
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
it
is
not
material
is
because
the
prosecutor
has
no
intention
whatsoever
of
ever
bringing
this
person
as
a
witness
in
any
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
materiality
is
violated,
does
not
then
that
--
that
prosecutor
--
since
he
had
no
intention
of
bringing
him
to
trial
or
of
having
him
as
a
witness
at
a
trial,
that
prosecutor
would
not
be
immune?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
does
--
how
does
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
statute.
if
an
officer
fills
out
an
affidavit
for
a
search
and
says
there
were
drugs
in
the
house,
so
i
want
to
search
it,
and
it
turns
out
he
was
lying,
you
would
have
a
damages
action?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
saying
the
officer,
because
he
told
a
lie.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
here
it
says
that
the
person
filling
out
the
affidavit
has
to
say
he
is
a
material
witness.
so
suppose
that
the
plaintiffs
were
to
prove
that
the
individual
who
signed
that
was
not
telling
the
truth
in
saying
he
is
a
material
instant
--
witness
because
not
just
but
for,
but
there
was
no
possibility
he
would
call
this
individual,
none.
and
that's
what
they
have
to
prove.
it's
really
very
hard
burden
of
proof.
now,
one,
would
that
interfere
significantly
with
law
enforcement?
and,
two,
how
do
you
distinguish
it
from
the
drug
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
the
case
of
the
agent,
you're
prepared
to
say
that
we
will
allow
the
plaintiff
to
go
into
his
motive
to
the
extent
that
the
plaintiff
can
show
there
is
no
possibility
he
intended
to
call
this
individual?
