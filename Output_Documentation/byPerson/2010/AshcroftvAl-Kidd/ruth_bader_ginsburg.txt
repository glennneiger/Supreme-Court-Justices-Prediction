was
mr.
al-kidd
--
was
he
released
after
--
i
understand
he
didn't
testify
at
the
trial,
and
there
was
an
acquittal,
and
then
other
charges

was
al-kidd
still
in
custody
as
a
material
witness
after
the
trial
was
over?
justice

but
he
was
restrained
much
longer
--
for
15
months.
justice

but
that's
after
there
is
probable
cause
to
suspect
that
criminal
activity
has
occurred.
and
then
you
--
once
you
have
probable
cause,
they're
not
going
to
look
behind
probable
cause.
but,
here,
the
whole
reason
for
using
this
material
witness
statute
is
that
there
isn't
probable
cause
to
believe
that
al-kidd
did
anything.
the
violation
--
there
was
no
violation
of
the
law.
so
whren
is
different.
it's
a
different
case.

how
does
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
katyal,
there
are
some
elements
of
this
picture
that
are
very
disturbing,
and
we
are
talking
about
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general's
immunity.
but
there
are
allegations
here
that
this
man
was
kept
awake,
the
lights
shining
in
his
cell
for
24
hours,
kept
without
clothes.
now
that
doesn't
sound
like
the
way
one
would
treat
someone
whose
testimony
you
want.
is
there
a
remedy
that
he
has
for
that
obvious
mistreatment?
