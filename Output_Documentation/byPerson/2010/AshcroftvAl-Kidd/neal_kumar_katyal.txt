mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
lawsuit
seeks
personal
money
damages
against
a
former
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
for
doing
his
job,
allegedly
with
an
improper
motive,
yet
the
attorney
general,
like
the
federal
prosecutor
in
idaho
who
sought
the
material
witness
warrant
at
issue
in
this
case,
was
performing
the
functions
of
his
office.
there
are
three
reasons
why
the
petitioner
should
not
be
personally
liable
for
money
damages.
the
first
is
because
the
prosecutor's
act
of
seeking
the
material
witness
warrant
is
integrally
associated
with
the
judicial
process
and
entitled
to
absolute
immunity.
to
view
it
any
other
way
is
to
expose
both
line
prosecutors
and
high
officials
to
lawsuits
by
highly
incentivized
litigants
based
on
their
purportedly
bad
motives.
that
is
something
this
court
has
manifestly
resisted
and
for
good
reason,
because
improper
motives
are
easy
to
allege
and
hard
to
disprove.
allowing
such
suits
to
proceed
would
result
in
burdensome
litigation
and
interfere
with
the
ability
of
prosecutors
to
do
their
jobs.
the
second
reason
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
not
violated,
and,
therefore,
qualified
immunity
applied.
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
statutory
requirements
of
section
3144
were
met
in
this
case,
and,
equally,
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
subjective
motivations
of
attorney
general
ashcroft
or
the
line
prosecutor
are
thoroughly
irrelevant
to
whether
a
fourth
amendment
violation
exists.
this
court
has
repeatedly
rejected
subjectivity,
explaining
that
otherwise
time-consuming,
vexatious,
burdensome,
and,
indeed,
destabilizing
discovery
and
litigation
would
be
the
inexorable
result.
and
the
third
reason,
and
the
easiest
reason,
is
that
whatever
one
thinks
the
applicable
law
is,
what
it
--
it
was
manifestly
not
the
law
in
2003
when
the
warrant
in
this
case
was
issued
by
a
neutral
judge
in
idaho.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
oh,
no,
it--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
take
it
there
may
be
a
difference.
we
think
the
court
should
first
decide
the
absolute
immunity
question,
which
is
the
way
that
this
court
has
historically
handled
questions
when
there's
an
absolute
immunity
question
and
then
a
qualified
immunity
one.
i
take
it
that
the
qualified
immunity
question
in
this
case
is
one
about
whether
motivations
matter
for
the
fourth
amendment;
whereas
the
motivation
question
in
the
absolute
immunity
sense,
as
respondents
see
it,
is
--
is
something
broader.
it's
not
limited
to
the
fourth
amendment,
per
se.
their
argument
is
if
the
prosecutor
is
--
has
bad
motives
essentially
or
a
certain
bad
motive,
an
investigatory
or
purposeful
bad
motive
to
engage
in
preventive
detention,
that
somehow
pierces
the
veil
of
absolute
immunity.
that
is
something
this
court
has
never
accepted.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
scalia,
to
be
sure,
they
are
now
making
that
argument
in
this
court,
that
this
doesn't
fall
--
this
isn't
intimately
associated--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--with
the
judicial
process.
below,
of
course,
they
said
the
reverse:
that
material
witness
warrants
were
associated
with
the
judicial
process
and
that
the
only
difference
is
that
--
that,
here,
they
had
a
bad
motive.
so
i've
talked
about
the
bad
motive
point.
now,
with
respect
to
whether
this
is
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
process,
these
are
material
witness
warrants
being
sought
in
connection
with
an
ongoing
investigation
by
a
prosecutor.
it
is
quintessentially
a
prosecutorial
function
to
obtain
these
warrants
and
has
been
for
--
for
hundreds
of
years,
and
it's
the
exercise
of
the
prosecutor's
professional
judgment,
which
is
something
that
this
court
has
looked
to.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
yes,
it
was.
the
indictment
of
mr.
al-hussayen
was
in
february
2003.
the
prosecutors
learned
in
march
that
mr.
al-kidd
was
about
to
board
a
plane
and
go
off
to
saudi
arabia
for
an
unspecified
length
of
time.
they
then
acted
immediately.
they
went
to
the
court
and
said
we
need
this
warrant
to
secure
this
testimony.
that
is,
to
me,
essentially
what
prosecutors
do
and
protected
by
imbler.
to
see
it
any
other
way
is
to
expose
prosecutors
to
lawsuits
for--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
ginsburg,
he
was
in
--
he
was
detained
for
only
a
period
of
16
days
total
in
2003.
is--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--he
had
travel
restrictions
placed
upon
him
until
the
trial
was
over
and
until
the
government
--
because
after
the
resolution
of
mr.
al-hussayen's
case,
which
was
acquittal
on
some
charges
and
a
hung
conviction
--
a
hung
--
a
hung
decision
on
others,
the
government
thought
about
retrying
mr.
al-hussayen,
took
it
very
seriously,
and
20
days
after
al-hussayen's
verdict
by
the
jury,
we
reached
an
agreement
with
them
in
writing
that
mr.
al-hussayen
would
leave
the
country
and
--
and
not
come
back,
and
in
exchange
we
weren't
going
to
prosecute
him
any
further.
and
so,
immediately
--
i
think
quite
soon
after
the
jury
verdict,
the
--
the
conditions
placed
on
mr.
al-kidd
were
lifted.
and
i
should
say
that
the
material
witness
warrant
statute
laces
into
it
a
whole
suite
of
safeguards
to
prevent
against
--
as,
justice
scalia,
you
pointed
out
--
the
potential
abuse
for
the
--
for
material
witnesses
by
prosecutors.
i
think
congress
has
set
up
several
different
things
to
prevent
that.
the
first
is,
in
order
to
get
a
material
witness
warrant,
the
prosecutor
needs
to
show
both
materiality
and
then
practicability.
the
second
is
that
there
are
strict
limits
placed
on
the
conditions
of
the
--
on
the
ability
of
the
prosecutor
to
detain
anyone.
section
3142
says
that
a
detention
can
only
be
allowed
by
a
judge
if,
quote,
"no
condition
or
combination
of
conditions
will
reasonably
assure
the
appearance
of
the
individual.
"
and
then
there's
a
formal
procedure
where
they
have
a
right
to
counsel,
they
have
the
right
to
cross-examine
witnesses,
to
--
to
present
evidence,
to
proffer
evidence
at
the
hearing,
and
the
like
--
all
to
show
that
they
shouldn't
continue
to
be
detained.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
for
two
reasons.
number
one
is
i
think
that's
the
way
this
court
has
historically
gone
about
it,
probably
for
reasons
of
constitutional
avoidance,
to
not
reach
constitutional
questions
if
there's
an
absolute
immunity
question.
and
the
second
is,
here,
you
have
a
ninth
circuit
decision,
justice
alito,
that
says
that
--
that
absolute
immunity
can
be
pierced
by
a
prosecutor's
bad
motive.
that
is
something
that
infects
not
simply
material
witness
warrant
cases
but,
indeed,
virtually
any
case.
as
we
point
out
and
as
the
dissent
below
pointed
out,
that
kind
of
argument
could
be
run
by
any
defendant
who
says
you
didn't
intend
to
actually
indict
me,
or,
you
didn't
care
about
that,
you
really
wanted
to
flip
me
to
get
testimony
against
some
higher-up.
and
to
allow
defendants
to
make
those
kinds
of
arguments
and
to
expose
line
prosecutors
and
attorneys
general
to
that
form
of
liability
is
an
extremely
damaging
proposition.
the
--
with
respect
to
the
fourth
amendment
question
about
whether
or
not
motive
applies,
i
think
this
court
has
quite
clearly
said
in
whren
that
motive
is
not
--
is
not
something
that
should
be
looked
to,
that
the
subjective
motivations
of
the
prosecutor
are
not
--
are--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
ginsburg,
it's
certainly
different
in
--
in
that
respect,
but
i
do
think
that
difference
doesn't
matter,
because
i
think
what
whren
and
edmond
and
the
cases
were
getting
at
is,
is
there
some
objective,
individualized
determination
by
a
neutral
judge?
and,
here,
as
i
was
saying
earlier,
there
is
quite
clearly
that
laced
into
the
3144
statute
itself;
that
is,
the
judge
must
find
materiality
and
--
and
impracticability
of
the
testimony.
and
that
is
a
standard
performing,
i
think,
a
long-standing
government
function
of
making
sure
that
testimony,
important
testimony,
is
available
at
trial.
so
it
is
not
like
a
situation
in
which
the
government,
just
on
their
mere
say-so,
can
put
the
--
can
detain
someone
on
the
basis
of
them
saying,
well,
we
think
this
person
has
information.
i
think
there
are
strict
standards
placed
on
that,
and,
indeed,
federal
rule
--
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
46
adds
standards
to
it
by
saying
that
a
prosecutor
must
report
to
the
judge
every
10
days
about
anyone
who
is
detained
and
assure
no
more
detention
is
necessary.
so
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely,
justice
scalia.
i
was
just
answering
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
qualified
immunity.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
imagine
one
point
about
the
statute
might
be
that
the
statutes,
going
all
the
way
back
to
1789,
do
reflect
that
this
is
a
prosecutorial
function
to
the
extent
there
is
any
doubt.
so,
for
example,
the
1846
statute
said
that
an
attorney
--
excuse
me,
an
attorney
of
the
united
states
must
apply
for
a
material
witness
warrant.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
that
is
correct,
that
that
is
quintessentially
what
prosecutors
do
in
the
exercise
of
trying
to
get
a
trial
--
a
trial
going.
now--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
if
the
--
if
the
--
i'm
not
sure
i
totally
follow--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--if
the
evidence
shows
that
the
evidence
is
not
material,
then
the
statute
is
violated.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
do
think
that
that
would
generally
mean
that
materiality
would
be
violated.
i
could
imagine--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--some
theoretical
construct--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
breyer,
let
me
--
let
me--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--just
make
sure
that
i
understand
the
contours
of
your
hypothetical.
i
don't
think
that
subjective
motivations
of
the
prosecutor
go
to
materiality.
so
if--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--here's
how
i
think
it
works:
so
i
think
that
congress
set
up
the
objective
two-part
test
to
decide
whether
or
not
an
arrest
warrant
would
take
place,
which
is
materiality
and
impracticability.
now,
that
isn't
subjective;
that
is
simply,
does
the
person
have
material
information
that
can
be
used
that
--
that's
relevant
to
the
trial.
now,
if
the
person
has
a
--
the
prosecutor
has
a
subjective
intent
that
says
i'm
never
going
to
use
this
testimony,
then
i
think
that
that
doesn't
--
that
will
--
that
will
almost
always
reflect
the
fact
that
materiality
just
objectively
hasn't
been
met
in
a
given
case,
but
theoretically
i
could
imagine
a
circumstance
in
which
the
prosecutor
has
that
subjective
intent
but
yet
is
material.
with
respect
to
that,
congress
has
a
different
safeguard
at
the
back
end,
in
3144,
and
that
is
the
language
in
3144
that
says
a
judge
in
the
detention
hearing
is
to
inquire
as
to
whether
or
not
the
detention
is
necessary,
quote,
"if
there
will
be
a
failure
of
justice.
"
if
the
person
is
released.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
think
that
the
--
the
defense
can
litigate
that
and
appeal
that
set
of
issues,
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
they
did,
because
we're
talking
about--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--exactly.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
at
the
time
itself.
but
i
think
that's
an
important
point,
justice
scalia.
with
respect
to
absolute
immunity,
this
court
has
often
said
that
it
is
the
crucible
of
the
trial
process
itself
that
often
is
a
safeguard
against
abuse.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
take
it
that
the
logic
of
this
court's
precedence
is
that
absolute
immunity
would
still
apply.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
absolute
immunity
isn't
some
rule
to
just
protect
prosecutors
willy-nilly;
it's
to
protect
the
public.
and
as
this
court
said
most
recently
unanimously
in
the
van
de
kamp
case,
that
--
quoting
learned
hand
--
that
--
that
there
is
a
cost
to
this.
no
doubt
that
certain
individuals
will
be
harmed,
but
the
cost
of
rooting
out
the
bad
apples
through
damages
lawsuits
is
far
worse,
that
it
causes
prosecutors
to
flinch
in
the
performance
of
their
duties.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
no,
i
do
think
it
goes
quite
a
bit
further
than
that.
i
think
it
--
and
i
think
burns
v.
reed
--
and
the
relevant
language
is
at
page
492
--
i
think
is
--
is
relevant
because
it
says
that
it's
pretrial
conduct,
in
order
to
secure
the
testimony
for
trial
or
the
like
is
--
is
what
is
protected
as
well,
that
it
would
be
far
too
narrow
to
just
focus
on
the
trial
itself;
and
that
would
be
the
contours
of
absolute
immunity.
i
think
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in
buckley
is
also
instructive
in
this
regard,
because
what
that
opinion
says
is
that
allowing
only
immunity
for
the
trial
would
just
allow
individuals
to
constantly
replead
their
allegations
and
focus
only
on
the
pretrial
conduct
and
be
an
end
run
around
absolute
immunity.
and,
again,
absolute
immunity
is
important
not
for
the
prosecutor
for
his
own
sake
or
her
own
sake,
but
because
ultimately
that
is
what
--
that
causing
--
damage
liability
will
--
will
make
prosecutors
flinch
the
performance
of
their
duties
more
generally.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--making
prosecutors
flinch
is
--
is
always
a
bad
thing.
what
i'm
referring
to
is
this
court's
precedents
that
say
damages
liability
on
prosecutors
is
the
wrong
way
to
go
about
it
because
the
costs
are
too
high
compared
to
the
benefits,
and
there
are
other
ways
of
dealing
with
that
--
from
professional
discipline,
as
malley
v.
briggs
and
imbler
said;
to
--
to
--
to
bar
actions;
to
the
crucible
of
the
trial
process
itself,
which
is
a
way
of
dealing
with
that.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
precisely
correct.
we
don't
think
those
are
constitutionally
compelled,
but
we
do
think
they
provide
a
very
important
safeguard.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
don't
think
it's
come
up
with
respect
to
public
prosecutors,
and
so
our
argument
here,
to
the
extent
the
court
reaches
that
question
--
and,
again,
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
raised
below
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
but
if
the
court
wanted
to
reach
that
question,
i
think
it
would
be
that
the
argument
would
derive
the
same
way
as
the
arguments
in
this
court's
post-imbler
cases,
which
is,
as
long
as
it
is
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
function
that
the
prosecutor
is
doing,
then
absolute
immunity
should
extend
to
that
context.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
do
think
that
the
government
--
i'm
not
sure
if
we
have
any
policy
with
respect
to
that,
but
i
think
that
--
that
we
--
that
at
least
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
there
wouldn't
be
a
violation
if
the
government
held
the
person
for
essentially
a
dual
motive,
and
that
is
what
i
understand
they
have
now
conceded
at
page
31
of
their
brief,
which
is
in
dual
motive
cases,
the
government's
action
is
permissible.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you.
this
is
a
simple
case.
it's
not
about
guantanamo,
it's
not
about
separation
of
powers,
it's
about
one
simple
thing:
should
we
allow
damages
actions
against
an
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
ultimately
ausas
for
doing
their
job,
when
they're
alleged
to
have
a
bad
motive?
if
i
could
start
with
the
chief
justice's
point
about
the
cost
of
these
lawsuits
and
allowing
them
to
proceed.
my
friend
on
the
other
side
says,
well,
but
this
will
be
a
small,
rare
case,
an
isolated
example,
but
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i
think
if
you
allow
their
motivation
argument
to
--
to
--
to
pierce
absolute
immunity,
you
will
have
this
in
every
case
or
near
every
case.
95
to
96
percent
of
federal
cases
are
resolved
by
plea
agreements.
so
there
isn't
someone
who
is
actually
called
at
trial.
you
could
allege
it
in
any
of
those
cases.
and
particularly
when
you
lace
on
to
that
what
my
friend
has
said
is
a
disturbing,
quote,
"national
pattern
of
abuse"
of
the
material
witness
statute,
something
which
we
--
with
which
we
vigorously
disagree,
but
if
you
could
add
the
fact
that
someone
wasn't
called
on
in
a
trial
to
that
national
pattern,
then
you'll
be
having
these
damages
actions
quite
a
bit
of
the
time.
now
he
says
don't
worry,
it
will
only
be
a
few
hundred
of
these
lawsuits.
well,
leaving
apart
the
fact
that
that
excludes
immigration
cases
and
excludes
the
states'
cases,
as
justice
kennedy
said,
a
few
hundred
lawsuits
just
at
the
federal
level
filed
against
the
attorney
general?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
ginsburg,
with
respect
to
that
whole
set
of
questions,
conditions
of
confinement,
that
isn't
before
the
court
right
now.
what
is
before
the
court
is
--
is
exclusively
fourth
amendment
concerns.
now,
mr.
al-kidd
did
sue
other
people,
including
the
warden
who
was
responsible
for
that,
and
i
think
that
there
have
been
other
ancillary
litigation
with
--
with
respect
to
that,
but
to
hold
either
the
attorney
general
or
prosecutors
liable
is
something
that
would,
i
think,
ultimately
open
the
door
to,
at
least
there
are
a
few
hundred
lawsuits
at
the
federal
level
if
not
more.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
officer--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--you
have
--
you
potentially
have
a
damages
against
the
officer,
not
against
the
prosecutor?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
yes.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
breyer,
i'm
not
sure
if
your
hypothetical
has
it
as
the
prosecutor
who
is
filing
the
affidavit
and
lying
or
the
agent.
if
it
is
the
agent,
i
don't
think
that
is
something
as
to
which
absolute
immunity
adheres,
that's
malley
v.
briggs
and
a
whole
line
of
cases.
qualified
immunity,
of
course,
would,
and
indeed
those
claims
are
pending
in
this--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
think
that
at
least
for
purposes
--
i
would
say
there
is
at
least
no
absolute
immunity
prohibition
against
that.
there
may
be
--
may
be
relevant
under
other
lines
of
authority.
but
with
respect
to
my
friend's
point
about
your
hypothetical
in
which
he
said
that
there
--
you
know,
the
government
isn't
sticking
to
its
position
or
something
like
that,
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
our
position
is
for
the
fourth
amendment,
it
doesn't
look
to
subjective
motivations
at
all.
that's
whren
and
brigham
city
and
the
like,
but
the
statute
in
3144
does
have
safeguards,
prophylactic
safeguards
to
guard
against
the
type
of
abuse
that
i
think
several
justices
have
mentioned
today.
so
that
you
could
only
detain
someone
so
long
as
their
release
wouldn't
result
in
a
failure
of
justice
and
the
like.
my
friend
also
said
that
--
that
there's
no
historical
precedent
for
this.
i
would
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
1846
statute,
which
didn't
require
failure
to
comply
before
a
witness
was
brought
in
on
a
material
witness
warrant
and
it
didn't
--
and
it
had
sureties
in
it.
i
don't
think
what
the
government
is
doing
here
is
any
different.
maybe
i'll
just
make
one
final
point,
picking
up
on
what
justice
alito
said
about
the
allegations
in
this
very
case,
because
i
don't
think
if
you
look
at
the
complaint
that
the
allegations
in
this
case
prove
either
that
the
attorney
general
or
the
line
ausa
had
a
single
motive.
this
is
fleshed
out
at
pages
17
to
19
of
our
reply
brief.
at
best,
they're
consistent
with
their
newly
minted
standard,
a
dual
motive
standard.
and
given
that,
i
think
that
the
complaint
would
fall
on
their
own
terms,
and
indeed
that
law
--
that
line
that
they're
proposing,
a
but-for
causation
line,
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
apply
in
practice
and
would
ultimately
lead
to
lawsuits
filed
against
attorneys
general
and
line
prosecutors
alike.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
