there
is
a
difference
between
calling
a
witness
at
trial
and
arresting
a
person.
how
is
it
a
part
of
the
prosecutorial
or
the
trial
function
to
arrest
someone?
isn't
what's
protected
absolutely
is
your
use
of
that
person
at
trial,
not
your
arrest
or
detention
of
them?

you
don't

you
don't
think
there's
a
reason
to
make
prosecutors
flinch
against
willy-nilly
--
that's
not
what
i'm
--
i'm
claiming
happened
here,
but
if
you
take
the
point
that
you're
raising,
then
prosecutors
can
out
of
spite,
out
of
pure
investigative
reasoning,
out
of
whatever
motive
they
have,
just
lock
people
up.
justice

and
you're

you're
basically
saying--
