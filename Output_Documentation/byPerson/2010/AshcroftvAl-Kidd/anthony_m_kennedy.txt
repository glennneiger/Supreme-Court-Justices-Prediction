justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
best
authority
that
at
--
at
common
law
or
the
common
law
tradition,
there
is
absolute
immunity
for
witness
--
for
the
issuance
of
witness
warrants?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
a
second
question,
quite
apart
from
immunity,
just
addressing
the
substantive
constitutional
issues
under
the
statute,
suppose
that
the
prosecutor
has
probable
cause
to
indict
and
try
the
person
for
the
crime.
suppose
also
that
there
is
good
reason
to
show
that
he
would
be
a
material
witness
as
to
another
participant
in
the
crime.
does
the
government
have
any
duty
to
proceed
with
the
indictment,
or
can
they
just
hold
the
person
as
a
material
witness
without
indicting?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
a
point
of
detail.
i
--
i
may
not
be
recalling
correctly.
you
said
this
statute
is
rarely
used.
i
thought
there
were
4,000
material
witness
hearings
a
year.
is
that
mostly
because
of
the
immigration?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
--
do
we
--
do
we
have
statistics
for
the
states,
how
many
states
hold
--
how
many
people
are
held
under
state
material
witness
statutes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
why
that
just
can't
be
resolved
under
the
issue
of
materiality.
the
magistrate
asks
the
prosecutor
why
he
wants
to
do
this,
and
he
infers
from
what
the
prosecutor
said
that
--
just
what
you
say.
then
it's
not
material.
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
