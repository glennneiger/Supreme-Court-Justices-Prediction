of
course,
but
the
problem
i
have
with
that,
mr.
phillips,
is
that
at
some
point
the
court
has
to
say,
“you
have
been
given
enough
time,
the
constitutional
violation
still
persists
as
the
state
itself
acknowledges”
–
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--
“overcrowding
is
the
principal
--
overcrowding
is
the
principal
cause,
as
experts
have
testified,
and
it's
now
time
for
a
remedy.
the
court
can't
--
has
to
at
some
point
focus
on
the
remedy,
and
that's
what
it
did,
and
that
it
seems
to
me
was
a
perfectly
reasonable
decision.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
at
some
point
the
state
itself
said
that
if
it
had
i
think
seven
years,
it
could
get
down
to
137.5,
and
didn't
seem
to
object
to
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
the
state
--
the
state
did
not
claim
that
either
order
in
either
case
has
succeeded
in
achieving
the
remedy.
you
have
never
claimed
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
--
and
just
if
i
can
have
your
attention
for
a
moment,
i
have
this
problem
with
the
case.
overcrowding
is
of
course
always
the
cause.
if
i
am
running
a
hotel
--
if
i
am
looking
at
a
highway
system,
i
need
a
highway,
what's
the
number
of
cars?
if
the
problem
is
bad
service
in
a
hotel,
well,
it's
the
number
of
employees
per
--
per
guest.
i
mean,
that's
fairly
simple.
now,
i
recognize
of
course
that
congress
has
--
had
imposed
a
special
duty
on
us,
but
i
think
it
means
that
overcrowding
must
not
be
ordered
unless
that
is
the
only
efficacious
remedy
in
--
in
a
permissible
period
of
time
and
it
seems
to
me
there
is
massive
expert
testimony
to
support
that
proposition
on
the
part
of
the
prisoners.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
experts
testified
to
that
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
strike
force
and
the
governor's
--
governor's
commission
reached
the
same
conclusion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
strike
team,
i
think
they
called
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
had
a
cutoff
date
of
some
two
months
before
the
trial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
--
but
before
that
point,
the
experts
that
were
--
had
testified
were
aware
of
the
conditions
that
existed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
argument
that
there
was
evidence
that
should
have
been
admitted,
but
that
was
not
with
reference
to
new
construction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
this
question
and
this
goes
just
to
remedy.
i
recognize
that
district
court
has
to
be
given
considerable
discretion.
it
shows
the
137.5
figure
because
it
is
halfway
between
145
and
130.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that
certainly
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
means
that
you
have
to,
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
release
order,
it
must
be
releasing
the
minimum
amount.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
will
affect
the
purposes
of
the
remedy
order.
there
was
substantial
expert
opinion
that
145
--
145
percent
would
be
sufficient.
doesn't
the
evidence
indicate
to
you
that
at
least
145
ought
to
be
the
beginning
point,
not
137.5?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
understand
--
may
i
make
--
there
were
more,
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
there
were
more
experts
that
testified
that
145
would
work
then
there
were
that
130
was
necessary?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
experts
--
the
experts
who
were
testifying
were
quite
aware
of
the
fact
that
overcrowding
related
to
the
constitutional
violations,
that
was
their
whole
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
any
number
of
them
suggested
that
145.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
state
--
pardon
me,
that
your
clients
said
that
145
wouldn't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
a
finding
by
the
three-judge
court
that
145,
is
it,
would
not
be
an
efficacious
remedy.
i
know
that
it
would
for
137.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
take
the
state's
concession
that
it
can
meet
a
goal
in
5
years
and
the
federal
court
order
is
2
years,
we
are
talking
about
3
years.
is
there
any
indication
of
how
fast
the
state's
remedy
would
click
in?
are
we
talking
maybe
about
a
5
percent
differential
for
the
last
3
years,
or
--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
i'm
saying,
assuming
--
compare
what
the
state
concedes
that
it
will
do
with
what
the
court
has
ordered
it
to
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
arises
from
serious
constitutional
violations
in
california's
prison
system.
the
violations
have
persisted
for
years.
they
remain
uncorrected.
now,
this
is
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
from
a
three-judge
district
court.
and
the
district
court's
order
directs
california
to
remedy
two
ongoing
violations
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause.
and
those
violations
are
the
subject
of
two
federal
class
actions.
the
first
case
is
coleman
versus
brown,
and
that
involves
prisoners
with
serious
mental
disorders.
plata
versus
brown
involves
prisoners
with
serious
medical
conditions.
and
the
order
of
the
three-judge
court
that
we're
reviewing
here
applies
to
both.
the
appeal
turns
largely
on
whether
the
order
complies
with
the
statutory
provisions
of
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
a
congressional
act,
enacted
in
1995.
the
specific
provision
to
be
consulted
for
the
case,
which
contains
many
of
the
phrases
that
the
court
examines,
is
18
u.s.c.
3626.
and
that
section
contains
limitations
on
the
issuance
of
orders
that
require
release
of
prisoners
to
remedy
constitutional
violations.
one
of
these
requirements
is
that
the
order
be
issued
by
a
three-judge
court.
the
court
today
issues
a
lengthy
opinion.
it
determines
that
the
order
of
the
three-judge
court
does
meet
all
the
statutory
requirements.
the
order
leaves
the
choice
of
means
to
reduce
overcrowding
to
the
discretion
of
state
officials.
but
absent
compliance
through
new
construction,
out-of-state
transfers,
or
other
means,
the
state
will
be
required
to
release
prisoners
before
their
full
sentences
have
been
served.
the
required
reduction
could
be
as
high
as
46,000
prisoners.
the
state
has
already
reduced
the
population
by
9000
persons
during
this
appeal.
further
reductions
need
not
be
accomplished
in
an
indiscriminate
manner.
the
state
may
employ
measures
that
will
mitigate
the
impact,
including
good-time
credits
and
diversion
of
low-risk
offenders
to
community-based
programs.
the
population
reduction
potentially
required
is
nevertheless
of
unprecedented
sweep
and
extent.
a
mistake
and
a
premature
release
of
even
one
prisoner
can
cause
injury
and
harm.
and
the
release
of
prisoners
in
large
numbers
is
a
matter
of
undoubted,
grave
--
grave
concern.
yet
so
too
is
the
continuing
injury
and
harm
resulting
from
these
serious
constitutional
violations.
for
years,
the
medical
and
mental
health
care
provided
by
california's
prisons
has
fallen
short
of
minimum
constitutional
requirements.
in
2006,
the
suicide
rate
in
california's
prison
was
nearly
80%
higher
than
the
national
average
for
prison
populations.
wait
times
for
mental
health
care
range
as
high
as
12
months.
prisoners
suffering
from
physical
illness
also
receive
severely
deficient
care.
and
the
record
documents
numerous
instances
of
delay
and
neglect
leading
to
suffering
and
--
and
even
death.
as
a
consequence
of
their
own
actions,
prisoners
maybe
deprived
the
fundamental
rights
of
liberty
yet
the
law
and
the
constitution
demand
recognition
of
certain
other
rights.
prisoners
retain
the
essence
of
human
dignity
inherent
in
all
persons.
respect
for
that
dignity
animates
the
eighth
amendment
prohibition
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
if
government
fails
to
provide
for
the
prisoners'
basic
needs,
the
courts
have
the
responsibility
to
remedy
a
resulting
eighth
amendment
violation.
years
of
efforts
to
remedy
the
violations
in
this
case
have
been
frustrated
by
severe
overcrowding.
california's
prisons
are
designed
to
house
a
population
just
under
80,000,
and
at
the
time
of
the
three-judge
court's
decision,
the
population
was
almost
double
that.
prisoners
are
crammed
into
spaces
neither
designed
nor
intended
to
house
inmates.
as
many
as
200
may
live
in
a
gymnasium,
monitored
by
as
few
as
two
or
three
correctional
officers,
as
many
as
54
prisoners
may
share
a
single
toilet.
short
term
gains
in
the
provision
of
care
have
been
eroded
by
the
long-term
effects
of
severe
and
pervasive
overcrowding.
when
the
three-judge
court
was
convened,
12
years
had
passed
since
the
appointment
of
the
special
master
in
the
coleman
case.
five
years
had
passed
since
the
approval
of
a
consent
decree,
it
was
a
consent
decree
approved
by
the
state.
five
years
had
passed
since
the
approval
of
that
decree
in
the
plata
case.
the
state
does
not
claim
that
either
measure
achieved
a
remedy.
both
the
coleman
and
plata
district
courts
had
recently
undertaken
additional
remedial
efforts,
including
the
appointment
of
a
receiver
in
the
plata
case.
the
basic
plan
to
solve
the
crisis
through
construction,
hiring
and
procedural
reforms
nevertheless
remained
unchanged.
the
special
master
and
the
---
and
the
receiver
were
unable
to
provide
assurance
that
such
efforts
would
yield
success
absent
a
population
reduction.
the
special
master
explained
that
many
of
the
clinical
advances
painfully
accomplished
over
the
past
decade
are
slip-sliding
away
as
a
result
of
overcrowding.
and
the
receiver
indicated
that,
absent
a
reduction
in
overcrowding,
a
successful
remedial
effort
could
all
but
bankrupt
california.
having
engaged
in
remedial
efforts
for
five
years
in
plata
and
12
years
in
coleman,
the
district
courts
were
not
required
to
wait
to
see
whether
more
recent
efforts
would
yield
equal
disappointment.
the
coleman
and
plata
courts
had
a
solid
basis
to
doubt
that
additional
efforts
to
build
facilities
and
hire
staff
would
achieve
a
remedy.
indeed,
although
four
years
have
passed
since
the
three-judge
court
was
convened,
there
is
still
no
indication
that
the
constitutional
violations
have
been
cured.
once
the
three-judge
court
was
convened,
it
was
required
to
find
that
overcrowding
is
the
primary
cause
of
the
violation.
the
record
documents
the
severe
impact
of
burgeoning
demand
on
the
provision
of
care.
crowding
creates
unsafe
and
unsanitary
conditions
that
hamper
effective
delivery
of
care.
a
medical
expert
described
living
quarters
in
converted
gymnasiums
or
dayrooms
as
breeding
grounds
for
disease.
cramped
conditions
promote
unrest
and
violence,
making
it
difficult
for
prison
officials
to
monitor
and
control
the
prison
population.
on
any
given
day,
prisoners
in
the
general
prison
population
may
become
ill,
thus
entering
the
plaintiff
class.
and
overcrowding
may
prevent
immediate
medical
attention
necessary
to
avoid
suffering,
death
and
spread
of
disease.
these
effects
are
particularly
acute
in
the
prisons'
reception
centers.
these
intake
areas
process
140,000
new
or
returning
persons
every
year.
crowding
in
these
areas
runs
as
high
as
300%
of
design
capacity.
some
inmates
are
held
in
a
reception
centers
for
their
entire
period
of
incarceration.
numerous
experts
testified
that
crowding
is
the
primary
cause
of
the
constitutional
violations.
and
these
experts
had
long
experience
in
correctional
systems
both
in
california
and
in
other
states.
the
former
warden
of
san
quentin
and
the
former
acting
secretary
of
the
california
prison
system
concluded
that
crowding
makes
it
virtually
impossible
for
the
organization
to
develop
much
less
implement
a
plan
to
provide
prisoners
with
adequate
quick
care.
the
state
points
to
no
significant
contrary
evidence
that
it
was
unable
to
present
and
that
it
would've
changed
the
outcome
here.
now,
construction
of
new
facilities
--
excuse
me.
construction
of
new
facilities,
in
theory,
could
alleviate
overcrowding,
but
the
three-judge
court
found
no
realistic
possibility
that
california
would
be
able
to
build
itself
out
of
this
crisis.
particularly
in
light
of
california's
fiscal
condition,
the
--
the
three-judge
court
deemed
chimerical
any
remedy
that
would
require
significant
additional
spending
by
the
state.
the
state
claims
that
a
combination
of
construction,
transfers
of
prisoners
to
other
states
and
other
reforms
could
remedy
the
violation.
this
is
a
long
opinion.
aside
from
asserting
this
proposition,
the
state
offers
no
reason
to
believe
that
that
is
so.
there's
noted
attempts
to
remedy
the
violations
in
plata
have
been
ongoing
for
nine
years.
and
in
coleman,
remedial
expert
--
remedial
efforts
have
been
going
on
for
16
years.
at
one
time,
it
may
have
been
possible
to
hope
that
these
violations
would
be
cured
without
a
reduction
in
overcrowding.
a
long
history
of
failed
remedial
orders
compels
a
different
conclusion
today.
the
three-judge
court
credited
substantial
evidence
that
prison
populations
can
be
reduced
in
a
manner
that
does
not
increase
crime
to
a
significant
degree.
some
evidence
indicated
that
reduced
overcrowding
can
even
improve
public
safety.
the
current
head
of
pennsylvania's
correctional
system
testified
that
measures
to
reduce
the
prison
population
may
actually
improve
on
public
safety
because
they
address
the
problems
that
brought
people
to
jail.
expert
witnesses
produced
statistical
evidence
that
prison
populations
had
been
lowered
without
adversely
affecting
public
safety
in
a
number
of
jurisdictions.
during
the
pendency
of
this
appeal,
the
state
in
fact
began
to
implement
measures
to
reduce
the
prison
population.
these
measures
will
shift
thousands
of
prisoners
from
the
state
prisons
to
county
jails
by
making
certain
felonies
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
county
jail
and
requiring
that
individuals
return
to
custody
for
violating
their
conditions
of
parole
serve
any
custody
term
in
the
county
jail.
this
supports
the
three-judge
court's
conclusions
that
the
prison
population
can
be
reduced
in
a
manner
calculated
to
avoid
an
undue
negative
effect
on
public
safety.
this
court
therefore
affirms
the
order
of
the
three-judge
court.
yet,
it
notes
that
the
three-judge
court
retains
the
authority,
and
that
the
responsibility
to
make
further
amendments
to
the
existing
order
as
warranted
by
the
exercise
of
its
sound
discretion.
proper
respect
for
the
state
requires
that
the
three-judge
court
exercise
its
jurisdiction
to
accord
the
state
considerable
latitude
to
find
mechanisms
and
make
plans
to
correct
the
violations
in
a
prompt
and
--
and
effective
way
consistent
with
public
safety.
the
state,
for
instance,
may
wish
to
move
to
extend
the
deadline
for
the
required
reduction
to
five
years
from
the
entry
of
the
judgment
of
this
court.
the
state
previously
proposed
the
five-year
deadline
as
consistent
with
the
public
safety.
the
three-judge
court
may
grant
such
a
request
provided
that
the
state
satisfies
necessary
and
appropriate
preconditions
designed
to
ensure
that
a
remedy
is
implemented
without
undue
delay.
the
three-judge
court
may
also
condition
an
extension
of
time
on
the
state's
ability
to
meet
interim
benchmarks
for
improvement
in
provision
of
medical
and
mental
health
care.
if
significant
progress
is
made
toward
remedying
the
underlying
constitutional
violations,
that
progress
may
demonstrate
that
further
population
reductions
are
not
necessarily
or
are
less
urgent
than
previously
believed.
were
the
state
to
make
this
showing,
the
three-judge
court
could
consider
whether
it
is
appropriate
to
extend
or
modify
the
timeline.
these
observations
reflect
the
fact
that
the
three-judge
court's
order,
like
all
continuing
equitable
decrees,
must
remain
open
to
appropriate
modification.
they
are
not
intended
to
cast
doubt
on
the
validity
of
the
basic
premise
of
the
existing
order.
the
medical
and
mental
health
care
provided
by
california's
prisons
falls
below
the
standard
of
decency
that
inheres
in
the
eighth
amendment.
this
extensive
and
ongoing
constitutional
violation
requires
a
remedy,
and
a
remedy
will
not
be
achieved
without
a
reduction
in
overcrowding.
the
relief
ordered
by
the
three-judge
court
is
required
by
the
constitution
and
was
authorized
