how
much
time
do
you
think
the
receiver
needed?
i
mean,
how
much
time
did
--
should
the
court
have
given
the
receiver
to
develop
his
plan
and
to
try
to
implement
his
plan?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
phillips,
my
trouble
listening
to
you
is
that
it
seems
as
though
you
are
asking
us
to
re-find
facts.
you
know,
you
have
these
judges
who
have
been
involved
in
these
cases
since
the
beginning,
for
20
years
in
the
plata
case,
who
thought,
we've
done
everything
we
can.
the
receiver
has
done
everything
he
can.
this
just
isn't
going
anywhere
and
it
won't
go
anywhere
until
we
can
address
this
root
cause
of
the
problem
and
that
was
the
view
of
the
judges
who
had
been
closest
to
the
cases
from
the
beginning
and
the
view
of
the
three-judge
court
generally.
so
how
can
we
reach
a
result
essentially
without,
you
know,
re-finding
the
facts
that
they
have
been
dealing
with
for
20
years?
justice
elena
kagan
why
wouldn't
it
have
been
the
better
course,
for
the
state
--
for
the
court
to
say,
you
know,
the
state
said
it
can
do
this
in
five
years
without
any
public
safety
problem?
justice
elena
kagan
so
why
don't
we
let
them
take
those
five
years?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
phillips,
sorry,
but
i'm
on
a
different
subject.
does
the
state
stand
by
its
representation
that
it
can
do
this
without
any
public
safety
impact
in
5
years?
justice
elena
kagan
that
means
it's
true.
justice
elena
kagan
not
--
notwithstanding
budget
--
economic
differences,
budget
differences?
justice
elena
kagan
but
if
they
were
5
years
you
think
you
could
do
it
without
any
public
safety
impact
in
the
way
that
you
told
the
court
you
could?
