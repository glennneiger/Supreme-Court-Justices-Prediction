justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
case,
mr.
phillips,
is
pending
for
20
years,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
seems
to
me
--
and
there
were
something
like
70
orders
from
the
district
court,
the
single-judge
district
court
in
that
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
no
change,
so
how
much
longer
do
we
have
to
wait,
another
20
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
in
fact
less
overcrowding
because
i
thought
what
this
case
was
all
about
was
that
the
receiver
has
said,
the
special
master
has
said,
“we
can't
make
any
progress
at
all
until
there
are
fewer
people;
we
have
no
place
to
put
clinics.
the
first
step,
not
the
last
step,
but
given
what
we
are
dealing
with
here,
the
potential
first
step,
is
that
we
have
fewer
people
so
there
is
more
room
for
these
health
facilities,
more
room
for
staff
to
operate.”
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
can't
provide
construction
when
the
state
doesn't
supply
the
money
for
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
if
there
are
--
if
there
are
these
great
changes
in
circumstances
so
that
now
they
--
medical
care
can
be
administered
in
something
approaching
a
decent
way,
you
could
go
back
to
the
single-judge
district
court
and
say
i'm
moving
under
60(b);
circumstances
have
changed,
it
is
no
longer
the
case
that
it's
impossible
to
render
decent
health
care.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
information
about
that
substantial
reduction?
i
mean,
in
this
record,
it
just
seems
to
be
that
it's
--
no
matter
how
many
efforts
have
been
made,
the
population
goes
up
and
now
you
say
that
the
population
has
gone
down;
from
what
point
in
time
and
how
much
has
it
gone
down?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
officer
himself
said,
“i
can't
do
this
without
as
a
first
step
reducing
the
population.
nothing
else
is
going
to
work
until
we
reduce
the
population
to
the
point
where
there
is
room
for
clinics,
room
for
medical
personnel
to
operate.”
i
mean,
that
was
the
view
of
the
district
judge,
the
special
master
in
one
case,
the
receiver
in
the
other
case,
everybody,
they
all
agreed
reducing
the
population
is
not
going
to
cure
it,
not
going
to
make
everything
perfect,
but
without
doing
that
as
a
first
step,
nothing
--
there
will
be
no
cure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
get
the
class
thing,
because
what
--
you
can't
have
a
remedy
just
limited
to
the
class.
the
class
wants
to
have
clinics.
they
want
to
have
personnel
who
function
someplace
outside
of
a
broom
closet.
so
you
can't
deal
with
this
problem
by
just
dealing
with
the
mentally
ill
and
the
people
with
medical
problems.
you
have
to
provide
space
for
facilities.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
--
the
--
that
brief
was
filed
because
the
--
there
were,
in
your
presentations
there
were
representations
about
the
special
master,
and
he
filed
that
brief
to
say,
“you
must
understand
this
in
context,
i
was
making
a
speech
at
the
club,”
but
he
wanted
to
put
in
context
what
you
had
used.
you
had
quoted
his
statements.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
piece
of
it
--
you
said
something
about
the
2.35
million,
they
didn't
come
up
with
the
8
million,
but
they
did
come
up
with
the
2.35
billion
and
then
i'm
just
looking
at
this
brief
for
the
receiver
and
there
is
a
footnote,
page
11,
footnote
3,
that
says,
“no,
that
money
isn't
there.
it
is
dependent
upon
several
approvals
that
have
not
yet
been
secured
and
such
approvals
ultimately
may
not
be
forthcoming.”
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
the
2.35?
i
mean,
i
think
you
did
say
earlier
that
this
was
a
done
deal,
2.35
billion,
but
this
is
a
note
telling
us
it's
not
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
one
project
that
the
joint
legislative
budget
committee
said,
no,
we
are
not
going
to
give
you
money
for
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
explain
me
something
about
that,
it
was
confusing
in
the
brief,
mr.
phillips?
i
thought
that
the
state
had
said,
“we
don't
want
the
plaintiffs
to
tour
these
facilities
any
more.
we
don't
want
to
have
discovery
go
beyond,
what
it
was,
some
date
in
2008.”
i
thought
that
it
was
the
state
that
was
urging,
“we
don't
need
any
more
discovery,
we
don't
want
any
more
inspection
tours.”
so
how
could
--
how
could
the
plaintiffs
submit
more
than
they
did
when
the
state
said
it's
enough,
2008
should
be
the
cutoff?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
don't
you
have
the
burden?
if
you
concede
that
you
have
been
in
constitutional
violation,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
is
no
longer
the
case.
that's
generally
so
in
the
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
we
are
talking
about
one
of
the
cases,
but
the
other
one,
and
it's
the
newer
one
in
2000
--
instituted
in
2001,
but
what
about
the
one
that
started
out
in
1990?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
specter,
there
has
been
at
least
two
significant
changes;
one
is
the
good
time
credit.
the
california
legislature
did
pass
the
law
that
upped
the
good
time
credit,
and
also
addressing
the
probationers
and
the
parolees,
the
technical
violators
from
the
system.
do
you
have
any
information
about
what
effect
that
legislation
was
passed
january?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
do
we
know
at
all
what
effect
this
has
had?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
--
is
there
any
other
case
where
the
prison
reduction
has
been
done
under
the
plra,
or
is
this
the
first
--
the
first
one?
