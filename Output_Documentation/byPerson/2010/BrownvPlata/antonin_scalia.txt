justice
antonin
scalia
i
will
summarize
my
dissent
which
as
you've
heard
is
joined
by
justice
thomas.
today,
the
court
affirms
what
is
perhaps
the
most
radical
injunction
issued
by
a
court
in
our
nation's
history,
an
order
requiring
california
to
release
the
staggering
number
of
46,000
convicted
felons.
the
court
disregards
stringently
drawn
provisions
of
the
governing
statute
and
traditional
constitutional
limitations
upon
the
power
of
a
federal
judge
in
order
to
uphold
--
uphold
the
absurd.
i
dissent
because
the
institutional
reform
the
district
court
has
undertaken
violates
the
terms
of
the
governing
statute
ignores
bedrock
limitations
on
the
power
of
article
iii
judges
and
takes
federal
courts
wildly
beyond
their
institutional
capacity.
first,
the
plaintiff
classes
here
should
never
have
been
certified.
the
classes
as
you
have
heard
consist
of
all
prisoners
who
are
seriously
mentally
ill
or
who
have
serious
mental
--
medical
conditions.
these
classes
do
not
base
their
claims
on
individual
instances
of
mistreatment.
it
is
not
claimed
that
all
or
even
most
of
them
have
been
denied
needed
care.
they
instead
based
their
claims
on
system
wide
deficiencies
in
medical
care.
but
the
sole
purpose
of
class
wide
adjudication
is
to
aggregate
claims
that
are
individually
valid.
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
each
and
every
prisoner
who
happens
to
be
physically
or
mentally
ill
in
a
prison
that
has
systemic
weaknesses
has
thus
suffered
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
the
only
viable
claims
are
those
by
prisoners
who
have
themselves
been
denied
needed
medical
treatment.
since
the
class
is
certified
here
are
improper,
it
follows
that
the
remedy
decreed
is
also
illegal.
the
remedy
of
reforming
the
system
as
a
whole
is
not
narrowly
drawn.
that's
a
quote
from
the
statute
as
required
by
the
prison
litigation
reform
act.
even
accepting
the
premise
that
class
certification
was
proper,
we
have
no
business
affirming
the
district
court's
structural
injunction.
this
case
illustrates
one
of
the
most
pernicious
aspects
of
structural
injunctions.
they
force
judges
to
engage
in
a
form
of
fact-finding
as
policy
making
that
is
outside
the
traditional
judicial
role.
the
fact-finding
that
judges
traditionally
engage
in
involves
the
determination
of
past
or
present
facts
based
exclusively
upon
a
closed
trial
record.
in
contrast,
when
a
judge
manages
a
structural
injunction
he
will
inevitably
be
required
to
make
broad
empirical
predictions
necessarily
based
in
large
part
upon
policy
views.
the
sort
of
predictions
regularly
made
by
legislators
and
executive
officials
but
inappropriate
for
the
third
branch.
this
feature
of
structural
injunctions
is
superbly
illustrated
by
the
district
court's
opinion.
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
among
other
things
that
the
evidence
was
"clear"
that
prison
over
crowding
would
"perpetuate
a
criminogenic
prison
system
that
itself
threatens
public
safety"
and
that
"additional
rehabilitated
programming
would
result
in
a
significant
population
reduction
while
improving
public
safety".
the
idea
that
the
three
district
judges
in
this
case
relied
solely
on
the
credibility
of
the
testifying
expert
witnesses
enriching
these
conclusions
is
fanciful.
of
course
they
were
relying
largely
on
their
own
beliefs
about
penology
and
recidivism.
what
it
could
here
is
no
more
judicial
fact-finding
in
the
ordinary
sense
then
would
be
the
factual
findings
that
deficit
spending
will
not
lower
the
unemployment
rate
or
that
the
continued
occupation
of
iraq
will
decrease
the
risk
of
terrorism.
yet,
because
they
have
been
granted
"factual
findings"
entitled
to
differential
review,
the
policy
preferences
of
three
district
judges
now
govern
the
operation
of
california's
penal
system.
but
structural
injunctions
do
not
simply
invite
judges
to
indulge
policy
preferences.
they
invite
judges
to
indulge
incompetent
policy
preferences.
three
years
of
law
school
and
familiarity
with
pertinent
supreme
court
precedents
give
no
insight
whatsoever
into
the
management
of
social
institutions.
the
district
court's
finding
that
constitutionally
adequate
medical
services
could
be
provided
if
the
prison
population
was
137.5%
of
design
capacity
was
a
finding
the
district
court
was
utterly
unqualified
to
make.
my
general
concern
is
about
judges
running
social
institutions
are
magnified
in
connection
with
prison
release
orders
recognizing
that
habeas
corpus
relief
must
be
granted
sparingly.
this
court
has
reversed
the
ninth
circuit's
erroneous
grant
of
habeas
relief
to
individual
california
prisoners
four
times
this
term
alone.
well
here,
the
court
affirms
an
order
granting
the
functional
equivalent
of
46,000
writs
of
habeas
corpus.
it
seems
that
the
court's
respect
for
state
sovereignty
has
vanished
in
the
case
where
it
most
matters.
the
court
attempts
to
defend
its
opinion
by
means
of
a
bizarre
coda
noting
that
"the
state
may
wish
to
move
for
modification
of
the
three-judge
courts
order
to
extend
the
deadline
for
the
required
reduction
to
five
years".
and
that
the
district
court
"may
grant
such
a
request
provided
that
the
state
satisfies
necessary
and
appropriate
preconditions
designed
to
ensure
the
measures
are
taken
to
implement
the
plan
without
undue
delay".
what
a
strange
thing
to
do
to
approve
the
injunction
in
its
present
form.
but
intimate
that
the
district
court
had
better
approve
certain
changes
if
the
state
asks
for
them
as
it
is
invited
to
ask.
the
court
must
be
aware
that
the
judges
of
the
district
court
are
likely
to
call
its
bluff
since
they
know
full
well
they
cannot
possibly
be
an
abusive
discretion
to
refuse
to
accept
the
state's
proposed
modifications
of
an
injunction
that
has
just
been
approved
by
this
court
in
its
present
form.
so
perhaps
the
coda
is
really
nothing
more
than
a
ceremonial
washing
of
the
hands
making
it
clear
for
all
to
see
that
if
the
terrible
thing
sure
to
happen
as
a
consequence
of
this
outrageous
order
do
happen,
they
will
be
none
of
this
court's
responsibility.
after
all,
did
we
not
want
and
indeed
even
suggest
something
better?
in
my
view,
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
prohibits
a
court
from
ordering
a
prisoner's
release
unless
it
determines
that
the
prisoner,
the
prisoner
is
suffering
from
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
and
that
his
release
and
no
other
relief
will
remedy
that
violation.
thus,
if
the
court
determines
that
a
particular
prisoner
is
being
denied
constitutionally
required
medical
treatment
and
the
release
of
that
prisoner
and
no
other
remedy
would
enable
him
to
obtain
medical
treatment,
then
the
court
can
order
his
release.
but
a
court
may
not
order
the
release
of
prisoners
who
have
suffered
no
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights
merely
to
make
it
less
likely
that
such
violations
will
happen
to
other
prisoners
in
the
future.
bear
in
mind
that
the
46,000
prisoners
ordered
to
be
released
are
not
those
who
have
been
denied
needed
medical
treatment.
they
are
not
even
those
who
suffer
mental
or
physical
illnesses
that
supposedly
place
them
in
danger
of
being
denied
needed
medical
treatment.
they
are
just
46,000
happy-go-lucky
felons
fortunate
enough
to
be
selected
for
release
in
order
to
make
more
space
that
the
district
court
has
"found
is
needed
to
solve
the
systemic
deficiency."
the
injunction
in
this
case
was
in
my
view
clearly
contrary
to
law.
