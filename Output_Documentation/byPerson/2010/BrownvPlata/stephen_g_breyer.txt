justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
the
receiver
said
the
best
statement
that
seemed
to
me
to
summarize
it.
it's
in
his
brief
on
page
9.
he
has
about
two
paragraphs
and
as
you
read
that
two
paragraphs,
it
sounds
as
if
overcrowding
is
a
big,
big
cause
of
this
problem,
which
is
horrendous,
which
if
you
think
it's
accurately
described
in
the
mental
case
in
the
first
page,
two
paragraphs,
if
that's
a
fair
description
from
the
record,
it's
a
horrendous
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
the
receiver
says
is
overcrowding
is
a
big
cause
of
it
and
then
he
says,
“i
think
we
have
discovered
you
actually
can
provide
care,
and
certainly
our
plan
and
turnaround
plan
believes
we
can
provide
constitutional
levels
of
care,
no
matter
what
the
population
is.”
so
then
you
look
to
the
care
and
turnaround
plan
and
it
says,
“spend
$8
billion
building
more
buildings
and
then
the
legislature
rejected
it.”
okay?
now,
there
we
are.
more
time,
what's
supposed
to
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
2.31
or
something
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
did
they
approve
the
2.3?
is
that
in
place,
2.35?
did
they
approve
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
said,
“we
need
eight,
we
need
eight
and
they
approved
2.35.”
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
evidence
here
that
suggests
that
2.35
is
sufficient
to
cure
the
constitutional
violation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
take
it
from
your
answer
the
answer
is
no,
there
is
no
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
he
says
--
what
the
receiver
says
about
the
2.35,
is
that
it
is
a
significant
step
farther.
it
is
certainly
better
than
no
construction
at
all.
however,
that
is
not
equivalent
to
a
conclusion
that
that
current
compromise
will
result
in
sustainable
constitutional
healthcare
at
current
population
density
levels.
that's
what
he
said
about
it.
so
we
have
his
views
and
i'm
back
to
my
question,
what
else
is
supposed
to
happen,
which
was
your
question
initially?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
do
i
look
at
to
find
this?
it's
a
big
record.
what
i
did
was
i
--
it
refers
to
on-line
evidence
and
i
went
and
looked
at
the
pictures,
and
the
pictures
are
pretty
horrendous
to
me
and
i
would
say
page
10
of
the
religious
group's
brief,
for
example,
shows
you
one
of
them
and
what
they
are
saying
is,
it's
--
it's
obvious,
just
look
at
it.
you
cannot
have
mental
health
facilities
that
will
stop
people
from
killing
themselves
and
you
cannot
have
medical
facilities
that
will
stop
staph
and
tubercular
infection
in
conditions
like
this
and
then
you
look
at
them
and
you've
looked
at
them.
i
have
looked
at
them
and
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
there
is
nothing
in
here
that
--
the
special
master
said
$8
billion
is
the
answer,
and
they
haven't
come
close.
so
how
can
i
or
you
if
you
were
in
my
position,
what
would
you
say
in
an
opinion
that
says
that
these
three
judges
who
have
200
pages
of
findings,
what
would
you
say
to,
to
--
as
an
answer
to
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
specifically
will
happen?
i
mean,
at
the
moment,
you
know,
we
could
go
through,
we
have
all
these
briefs,
i
mean
there
are
all
these
experts,
all
the
reports.
everybody
is
saying
you
need
to
spend
the
money
and
we
have
--
if
you
really
want
to
cure
the
constitutional
violation,
we
have
the
legislature
rejecting
8
billion
but
2,
which
doesn't
--
2.35,
and
so
--
nothing,
and
a
void
and
give
us
more
time.
i
mean,
i
read
the
newspaper.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
california
has
been
voting
a
lot
of
money
for
new
programs.
the
--
the
--
what
is
it
--
what
is
it
specifically
that
would
happen
that
would
cure
this
problem
were
we
to
say
--
i
mean,
a
big
human
rights
problem
--
what
would
we
say
--
what
would
happen
if
we
were
to
say,
no,
this
panel's
wrong?
what
would
happen
that
would
cure
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
constitutional
problem
which
the
state
itself
admits
is
constitutional,
a
state
with
a
governor
who
has
said
publicly
that
there
is
this
tremendous
safety
and
health
problem
in
the
prisons.
what
--
what
would
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
number?
i
was
puzzled
about
the
same
thing
that
justice
sotomayor
was.
i
read
on
page
253
of
the
appendix
a
conclusion
where
the
district
court
said
it
is
our
conclusion
that
they
can
reduce
this
by
how
many
people,
what
is
it,
30,000
--
it's
a
lot?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
35,000,
and
this
could
be
done
safely.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
preceding
page,
whatever
that
was,
253.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
about
six
pages
where
they
summarize
evidence
from
all
kinds
of
criminologists
that
say,
for
example,
there
are
17,000
technical
parole
violators
that
are
being
sent
to
prison
who
haven't
committed
additional
crimes
and
they
could
perhaps
be
released
from
some
of
the
time
that
they're
spending
in
prison.
then
they
go
on
to
this
good
time,
which
would,
i
guess,
lead
to
people
who
are
50
years
old
or
60
years
old
who
have
been
in
prison
for
40
years
would
be
released
at
age
55
instead
of
age
75,
i
guess
there
is
some
category
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
they
had
several
other
things.
okay,
now
what
are
some
facts
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
–
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
evidence
on
--
i
see
their
suggestions
--
the
technical
parole
violators
go
elsewhere.
the
elderly
and
infirmed
prisoners,
some
of
them
be
released.
the
good
time
credits
for
older
people
were
--
would
have
effect,
be
increased,
and
also,
halfway
houses
and
other
kinds
of
prison
facilities
which
used
to
be
called
less
--
less
physically
restrictive
punishments,
or
taking
the
money
you
save
and
building
new
prisons.
okay,
that
seems
to
be
the
gamut.
is
there
any
evidence,
statistically
or
otherwise
because
it
used
to
be
that
states
did
rely
on
halfway
houses,
it
relied
upon,
they
relied
upon
--
they
relied
upon
certain
camps
--
prison
camps,
for
example
--
and
some
of
them
were
pretty
tough
and
there
were
a
whole
range
of
what
used
to
be
called
intermediate
punishments.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right
is
there
any
statistical
evidence
on
the
part
--
on
the
point
that
justice
alito
raised
--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--
as
to
whether
these
did
or
did
not
result
in
higher
crime
rates?
