justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me,
could
you
tell
me
from
your
briefs,
i
just
haven't
understood
what
the
alternative
steps
are?
the
court
below
talked
about
some
proposals
like
construction
and
said
the
legislature
has
struck
them
down.
there's
--
the
fiscal
crisis
has
gotten
worse,
so
construction
is
really
not
an
option.
i
don't
see
how
you
wait
for
an
option
that
doesn't
exist.
they
talked
about
hiring
more
staff,
but
the
conclusion
was
that
even
if
you
maximize
the
staff,
you
don't
have
the
facilities
to
add
more
staff,
which
is
what
you
need
to
cure
the
constitutional
violation.
so
tell
me
what
specific
steps
outside
of
this
order
should
have
been
given
time
to
be
implemented
because
the
receiver
has
basically
said,
“i've
tried,
and
the
small
progress
we
made
has
been
reversed
because
the
population
just
keeps
growing.
so
we
can
never
get
ahead
of
the
problem.”
so
slow
down
from
the
rhetoric
and
give
me
concrete
–
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--
details
about
what
the
least
restrictive
means
would
have
been
other
than
to
say,
throw
it
back
to
a
receiver
and
special
master
who
are
saying,
we
don't
have
a
solution
outside
of
reducing
overcrowding.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
oh,
counsel
that
was
one
statement
years
ago.
is
that
is
all
you
are
relying
on?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
may
be
your
weakest
argument.
tell
me
--
give
me
concrete
steps
that
are
least
--
less
restrictive.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
go
back
to
that
panel
because
it
invited
you
to.
it
said
if
circumstances
change,
come
back.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
possible
that
within
the
two-year
period,
you
are
going
to
hit
the
mark,
if
you
--
that's
what
--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--
that's
what
the
three-judge
panel
said,
which
is
if
you
implement
most
of
the
proposals
being
made,
you
are
likely
to
hit
the
mark.
so
what
you
are
saying
is
you
are
going
to
do
it
and
if
you
don't,
they
invited
you
to
come
back
and
--
you
really
don't
think
that
if
you
hit
140
percentage,
that
the
court
is
going
to
order
an
immediate
release
of
the
2.5
percent
over
the
limit
it
set?
it's
going
to
ask
you,
“what
have
you
put
into
place
to
reach
that
level
over
what
additional
period
of
time?”
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
are
we
fighting
about?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
we
fighting
about
that
the
plan
was
wrong
or
are
we
fighting
about
that
you
are
angry
that
you
were
told
to
do
it
in
two
years
--
in
22
years,
as
opposed
to
do
it
in
25
years?
is
that
--
is
that
what
you're
objecting
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
do
it
in
5
years?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
the
best
interest
of
the
state
of
california,
isn't
it
to
deliver
adequate
constitutional
care
to
the
people
that
it
incarcerates?
that's
a
constitutional
obligation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
when
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
what
are
you
going
to
avoid
the
needless
deaths
that
were
reported
in
this
record?
when
are
you
going
to
avoid
or
get
around
people
sitting
in
their
feces
for
days
in
a
dazed
state?
when
are
you
going
to
get
to
a
point
where
you
are
going
to
deliver
care
that
is
going
to
be
adequate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
did
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
this
issue
about
evidence,
did
you
proffer
to
the
judge
anywhere
in
this
record
what
the
additional
evidence
it
was
that
you
wanted
to
show?
i
know
that
the
decrease
in
suicides
happened
post-trial,
so
you
couldn't
have
proffered
that
pretrial.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
are
from
the
prisons.
i
presume
that
you
could
have
yourself
without
discovery
set
forth
or
proffer
for
the
court
that
says,
“we
had
a
wait
time
between
diagnosis
and
treatment
that
was
60
days,
90
days,
120
days
in
the
past
and
we
have
reduced
that
down
now
to
two
weeks
or
whatever
the
reality
is.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
didn't
you
--
you
keep
saying
we
were
blocked.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
except
that
the
district
court
invited
you
to
proffer
that
evidence
that
went
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
remedy,
so
you
didn't
have
to
proffer
it.
it
viewed
you
as
saying,
we
are
no
longer
violating,
constitutionally
violating
the
eighth
amendment.
instead
it
said,
“we
will
take
whatever
you
have
to
proffer
to
show
that
the
remedy
is
inappropriate.”
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
talking
about
current
figures
or
past?
tell
us
the
date
of
the
figures?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
i
thought.
how
do
you
address
your
adversary's
point
that
the
adequacy
of
a
remedy
can't
be
measured
unless
you
measure
the
state
of
the
situation
at
the
time
the
remedy
is
imposed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
give
us
the
record?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel
--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
didn't
the
court
--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel
--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel.
didn't
–
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
several
questions
but
i'm
not
sure
why
--
you
have
not
been
responding
to
justice
--
to
the
chief
justice.
didn't
the
district
court
discuss
different
safe
ways
of
reducing
the
population?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
said,
we
are
not
imposing
them
because
we
want
the
state
to
do
--
to
choose
among
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
i've
looked
at
the
state's
final
plan,
i
thought
that
they
had
in
fact
not
only
accepted
all
of
the
recommendations,
but
they
added
a
couple
of
additional
remedies
that
the
court
had
not
suggested?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
it
a
fair
statement
that
the
district,
that
the
three
judge
panel
was
saying,
if
you
do
these
things
that's
their
finding,
you
can
do
it
without
affecting
public
safety,
wasn't
that
what
they
were
saying?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
second
more
important
question
was
going
back
to
something
that
justice
scalia
asked
you,
which
was,
you
made
the
statement
that
no
one
was
stopped
from
proffering
evidence
about
prison
conditions
up
till
two
months
before
the
trial.
so
what
evidence
was
excluded?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
point
is
the
other
side
making
that
they
were
excluded
from
making?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
the
experts.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
expert
who
gave
the
145?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
expert
who
gave
the
145?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
go
to
the
one
who's
used
the
145
figure.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he
was
a
what?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
did
he
say
that
145
you
could
deliver
healthcare?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
should
the
court
have
said
2
years
for
everything
but
construction?
wouldn't
that
have
been
a
more
narrowly
tailored
remedy?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
except
that
they
--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--
that
there
was
going
to
be
no
construction
adequate,
because
there
was
no
money.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
what
page
was
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry;
i
don't
know
what
the
declaration
said.
is
the
actual
declaration
in
the
record
somewhere?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
didn't
you
give
the
court
that
as
your
plan?
the
court
gave
you
absolute
discretion
to
implement
the
plan
that
you
wanted.
it
said
we
don't
want
to
do
facility
by
facility,
because
we
want
you
to
figure
out
where
you
need
to
implement.
so,
your
client
didn't
do
that,
why,
either
in
your
5-year
plan
or
in
your
2-year
plan?
