mr.
donald
specter
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
20
years,
the
overcrowding
crisis
has
caused
prisoners
suffering
from
psychosis
and
life-threatening
illnesses
to
languish
in
their
cells
because
treatment
facilities
have
no
room
for
them.
prisoners
are
committing
suicide
at
a
rate
twice
the
national
average
and
more
than
two-thirds
of
those
suicides
are
preventable.
the
absence
of--
mr.
donald
specter
sure.
that's
from
the
trial
court's
opinion,
your
honor.
that's
from
the
record.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
there
was
massive
amounts
of
evidence
about
the
constitutional
violations
that
existed
at
the
time
that
the
remedy
was
imposed.
and
if
we
--
i
can
point
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
1
appendix,
page
30a,
the
court
said,
"nonetheless,
as
we
described
below,
fundamental
unconstitutional
deficiency
is
caused
primarily
by
overcrowding
continue
to
exist."
mr.
donald
specter
no,
your
honor
i'm
sorry,
that's
not
correct,
with
all
respect.
they
took
massive
amounts
of
evidence
up
to
the
day
of
trial
about
all
the
conditions
as
they
relate
to
the
remedy
and
those
conditions
were--
mr.
donald
specter
current
as
of
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
my
friend
and
i
have
a
disagreement,
but
i
think
justice
sotomayor
accurately
captured
it.
what
the
three-judge
panel
said
is,
look,
we're
not
going
to
--
you
can't
--
this
isn't
the
place
for
you
to
come
in
and
say
everything's
fine,
everything's
constitutional.
what
the
three-judge
court
did
say
is,
“we
will
consider”
and
they
did
in
fact
consider
all
of
the
evidence
from
the
state,
they
had
experts
from
the
state,
two
of
the
prisons,
in
august
2008,
those
experts
wrote
reports,
they
testified,
and
they
testified
about
the
conditions
current
and
one
of
them
from
the
mental
health
--
mr.
donald
specter
that
was
the
time
of
the
trial,
your
honor.
the
discovery--
mr.
donald
specter
in
august,
and
the
trial
started
in
november.
mr.
donald
specter
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
the
remedy
--
well,
the
final
order
came
--
well,
the
close
of
evidence
was
in
december
of
2008.
mr.
donald
specter
no,
no
in
the
three-judge
court.
the
three-judge
court
closed
evidence
in
december
of
2008.
we
then
argued
the
case
after
the
post-trial
briefing
in
february
of
2009.
then
the
court
came
out
with
the
tentative
decision
about
20
days
later,
and
then
in
august
of
2009,
it
issued
the
183-page
opinion
and
the
order.
mr.
donald
specter
the
trial
closed
in
december
of
2008,
after
all
the
parties
had
submitted
all
their
evidence.
then
there
was
post-trial
briefing
for
a
month.
then
we
had
argument
in
february
of
that
year
and
then
a
few
weeks
later,
they
issued
a
brief
summary
of
their
conclusions
in
an
attempt
to
get
the
state
and
the
parties
to
settle
the
case.
mr.
donald
specter
i
agree
with
my
friend
mr.
phillips
that
the
population
has
declined
by
about
10,000
prisoners.
most
of
that
decline
has
been
due
to
transfer
to
out-of-state
prisons,
and
true,
there
is
some
amount
of
it
has
been
as
a
result
of
the
marginal
increase
in
good
time
credits,
which
the
state
elected
to
pursue
on
its
own.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
i
don't
--
there
was
no
evidence
that
wasn't
--
that
was
offered
that
wasn't
considered
by
the
three-judge
panel,
your
honor.
they
considered
all
the
evidence.
their
183-page
opinion
is
scrupulous
in
considering
all
the
evidence,
both
that
supported
the
order
and
they
distinguished
the
evidence
and,
in
fact,
made
credibility
determinations
based
on
the
evidence
that
was
contrary.
but
i
–
mr.
donald
specter
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
--
the
court
made
findings
that
137.5
percent
was
the
maximum
number
of
prisoners
that
--
of
the
capacity,
of
the
designed
capacity
of
the
prison,
that
the
prison
could
have
that
would
enable
the
state
to
--
to
have
all
those
things
you
just
mentioned,
staffing,
facilities,
medication
management,
be
effective
and
reach
the
actual
prisoners
who
are
ill,
seriously
ill.
mr.
donald
specter
no,
it
--
you
could
have
--
it's
a
remedy,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
that's
--
that's
--
and
you're
right.
if
there
were
--
if
the
cells
were
crowded,
but
the
prison
had
all
the
other
facilities
available,
then
there
might
not
be
a
problem.
you
have
to
--
well,
i
hope
you
can
understand
that
in
this
case,
the
prisons
were
built
to
double-cell
the
prisoners,
but
they
weren't
built
to
provide
200
percent
of
healthcare
needs.
so
as
soon
as
they
started
to
double-cell
these
prisoners,
they
could
meet
their
literal
housing
needs
in
the
space
of
the
cell,
but
they
couldn't
meet
the
needs
of
their
healthcare
and
that's
why,
your
honor,
the
137.5
percent
figure
is
reasonable
because
the
court
went
almost
a
third
overcrowding
above
what
all
the
experts
recommended.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
i
have
two
responses
to
that,
and
they
are
both
a
little
separate.
the
first
point,
it's
important
to
understand
that
this
is
not
a
release
order.
it's
a
population
crowding
reduction
order.
the
court
is
not
ordering
the
state
to
throw
open
the
gates
of
its
doors
and
release
people.
they
can
reduce
crowding
through
more
transfers
to
out
of
state.
to
your
construction
point,
if
the
state
still
chooses,
it
can
construct
new
facilities
to
increase
the
capacity,
and
the
three-judge
panel
said
if
you
increase
the
capacity,
you
can
increase
the
population.
the
point
about--
mr.
donald
specter
exactly.
so
that
goes
to
the
second
part
of
your
question,
which
is
why
don't
they
try
other
things,
like
ordering
the
prisons
to
hire
more
doctors,
ordering
better
medication
management,
all
of
those
kinds
of
things?
and
the
answer
to
that
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
appellee's
coleman
brief,
which
lists
70
discrete
orders
which
the
coleman
court,
single-judge
coleman
court,
tried
over
a
period
of
15
years,
which
have
proven
singularly
to
be
ineffective
and
that
is
why
the
court
analyzed
all
those
things.
the
trial
court
analyzed
all
those
things,
and
it
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
based
on
the
statements
by
the
special
master,
by
the
receiver's
reports,
and
by
the
general
horrendous
conditions
which
we
have
in
these
prisons,
that
those
discrete
orders
would
not
solve
the
problem
and
given
the
level
of
harm
--
mr.
donald
specter
no.
mr.
donald
specter
no,
that
--
no,
your
honor,
to
the
contrary,
justice
alito,
we
--
i
think
the
court
believes
based
on
the
facts
that
it
found
that
this
would
be
an
effective
remedy.
all
of
the
testimony
that
they
heard
from
experts
from
texas,
from
pennsylvania,
from
washington
state,
all
of
whom
had
suffered,
had
dealt
with
crowding
in
their
prison
systems,
has
said
that
when
you
reduce
the
crowding,
that's
the
critical
thing
that
you
have
to
do
now
because
unless
you
reduce
the
crowding,
nothing
else
is
going
to
work,
and
the
court
found
that
that
was
exactly
true.
nothing
else
over
20
years
in
one
case,
and
over
8
years
in
another
case
has
worked
and
all
--
as
justice
kennedy
said,
massive
amounts
of
evidence
show
that
the
primary
reason
it
hasn't
worked
is
one
singular
word,
overcrowding
and
when
you
reduce
overcrowding
the
prison
will
be
able
to
operate
and
will
be
able
to
provide
those
services
that
it
can't
provide
now,
so
the
doctors
will
have
room
to
be
able
to
work,
which
they
don't
have
now.
there
will
be
less
prisoners,
so
officers
will
be
able
to
take
them
from
one
place
to
another
to
get
treatment.
there
won't
be
so
many
lockdowns
which
inhibit
care.
mr.
donald
specter
crowding
–
mr.
donald
specter
well
--
mr.
donald
specter
your
honor,
this
trial
court
found
based
on,
50
pages
of
its
opinion,
based
on
expert
testimony,
not
only
from
our
experts,
but
from
the
state's
experts,
from
the
intervenors'
experts.
they
all
came
to
the
unanimous
conclusion
that
there
are
methods
that
--
by
which
you
can
reduce
crowding
which
will
not
increase
crime
and
they
are
safe.
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
corrections
who
was
the
secretary
at
the
time
of
trial
testified
that
he
was
in
favor,
for
example,
of
increasing
prisoner's
good
time
credits.
that's
one
way
to
reduce
crowding
and
moreover,
there
was
statistical
evidence
saying,
looking
at
all
the
other
states
that
had
reduced
their
prison
population
over
a
period
of
about
15
years,
and
they
all
came
to
the
same
conclusion,
all
of
those
studies
came
to
the
same
conclusion,
which
is
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
increase
in
the
crime
rate.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
right,
but
the--
mr.
donald
specter
right.
i
know
--
mr.
donald
specter
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
and
i'll
tell
you
why--
mr.
donald
specter
at
least
it's
respectful.
[laughter]
i
will
tell
you
why
i
think
that.
the
court
examined
all
of
the
methods
that
are
commonly
used
and
that
the
governor
himself
has
proposed
to
reduce
crowding.
the
governor
himself
wanted
to
reduce
the
prison
population
by
37,000.
that
was
in
one
of
his
legislative
enactments,
and
the
secretary
of
corrections
testified
that
those
proposals
were
safe.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor,
he
did.
he
submitted
legislation
to
the
legislature
for
that,
and
the
legislature
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
take
it
and
the
governor
actually
said,
reacting
to
that,
after
a
riot
at
chino
which
was
partly
--
at
one
of
the
--
chino
is
a
prison
in
california,
a
riot,
he
said,
"and
the
politicians
in
sacramento
have
swept
the
problem
under
the
rug."
mr.
donald
specter
i'll
get
to
that.
mr.
donald
specter
right.
mr.
donald
specter
yes.
mr.
donald
specter
right.
well,
i
think
all
of
the
--
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
analyze
the
plan,
because
the
court
was
trying
--
well,
there
was
no
plan.
the
court,
what
they
--
what
the
court
did
was
it
said,
we
want
to
give
the
state
the
maximum
flexibility
for
comity
reasons
to
determine
how
best
to
remedy
the
constitutional
violations.
now
i
am
certain
then
they
said
--
they
also
said
that
we're
sure
the
state
can
do
it
in
a
safe
way,
but
it's
not
our
job
to
--
the
method.
mr.
donald
specter
right
and
the
--
that's
the
state's
position
and
had
been
the
state's
position
all
along.
the
court's
findings
that
a
population
reduction
of
this
magnitude
were
clear
and
they
are
not
shown
to
be
clearly
erroneous
here.
they
--
the
court
said
point
blank
that
we
--
we're
--
it's
our
finding
that
the
state
can
reduce
the
population
to
its
current
levels
--
from
its
current
levels
to
137.5
safely.
they
made
that
finding--
mr.
donald
specter
--
and
they
haven't
been
shown
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
so
they
didn't
have
to
look
at
particulars.
in
an
effort
to
give
the
state
the
maximum
flexibility,
they
wanted
to
allow
the
state
to
choose
the
methods
that
it
wanted.
if
the
state
--
if
the
court
had
ordered--
mr.
donald
specter
but
they
can
also
do
it
safely
--
mr.
donald
specter
no,
it
isn't,
your
honor,
because
they
can
also
do
it
safely
by
good
time
credits.
they
can
do
it
safely
--
mr.
donald
specter
just
a
--
you
know,
the
evidence
was
at
trial,
and
the
court's
finding
about
that
evidence
was,
and
the
state
officials
so
testified,
that
giving
prisoners
good
time
credits
is
not
a
threat
to
public
safety.
mr.
donald
specter
right.
mr.
donald
specter
because
your
honor
as
justice
ginsburg
and
others
have
been
saying
before
the
constitutional
violations
have
been
ongoing
for
20
years.
we
are
dealing
here
with
cases
of
life
and
death
and
serious
injury.
and
after
all
these
years,
when
they
--
when
they
heard
the
evidence
that
said
that
population
could
be
--
and
they
made
the
findings
which
the
state
doesn't
argue
were
clearly
erroneous,
and
they
made
those
findings
that
it
could
be
reduced
safely,
they
had
an
obligation
to
provide
a
remedy
that
would
provide
constitutionally
adequate
care
in
the
safest
manner
possible
--
in
the
quickest
manner
possible.
mr.
donald
specter
yes.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor,
if
i
didn't
make
that
clear,
i
meant
to.
mr.
donald
specter
nothing.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
as
we
said
in
our
briefs,
your
honor,
there
was
no
evidence
that
was
excluded,
and
in
fact,
the
state's
witnesses
testified
about
conditions,
some
of
the
conditions
current
as
of
the
day
of
the
testimony.
so
it
was
very
current.
nothing
was
excluded.
even
if
the
court
made
a
ruling
which
was
error,
which
we
don't
believe
it
was,
there
was
absolutely
no
prejudice.
mr.
donald
specter
35,000.
mr.
donald
specter
yes.
mr.
donald
specter
right.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
and
there
was
also
testimony
that
the
department
of
corrections
was
using
a
risk
assessment
instrument
to
identify
the
low
risk
prisoners.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
all
the
witnesses
from
the
state,
the
interveners,
the
local
witnesses,
our
experts,
they
all
found
that
those
would
help
reduce
crime
and
that
they
would
be
most
effective
if
they
were
continued,
but
they
would
be
effective
also
if
they
were
--
mr.
donald
specter
well,
you
can't
say
generally
because
different
programs
have
different
records.
mr.
donald
specter
i
don't
know.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
yes.
mr.
donald
specter
well
--
mr.
donald
specter
no.
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
record,
your
honor.
the
145
figure
came
from
a
report
by
the
former
governor,
duke
majin,
and
a
group
that
he
organized
and
they
said
that
they
could
operate
a
crowded
system
at
145
percent
of
capacity
and
that
figure
was
high,
the
district
court
found,
because
it
didn't
take
into
account
healthcare
needs.
it
didn't
take
into
account
healthcare
needs,
which
is
the
issue
here
and
our
experts
testified
that
because
it
didn't
take
into
account
healthcare
needs,
130
percent
was
the
better
number.
it's
the
number
that
the
strike
team
had
thought
of,
the
administration's
own
strike
team.
it's
the
number
that
these
professional
experts
believed
would
be
sufficient
to
remedy
the
population
and
back
to
my
answer
to
justice
alito's
question
is,
the
healthcare
facilities
themselves
were
built
to
provide
services
to
only
100
percent
--
healthcare
services
to
only
100
percent
of
prisoners.
mr.
donald
specter
yes.
mr.
donald
specter
i
think
there
might
have
been
only
one,
one
expert
suggested
145.
i
think
most,
the
majority
of
the
experts
suggested
130.
the
court
found
and
it
has
not
been
challenged
here
as
clearly
erroneous,
that
the
weight
of
the
evidence
went
to
130.
they
wanted
to
do
what
you're
saying,
which
was
to
minimize
the
intrusion
and
maximize
the
population.
so
even
though
they
found,
the
court
had
ample
basis
to
issue
an
order
saying
it
should
be
130,
they
said
in
an
abundance
of
caution
and
to
give
the
state
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
to
make
sure,
we
are
going
to
bump
it
up
an
extra
7.5
percent.
mr.
donald
specter
i
think
--
mr.
donald
specter
thank
you.
my
recollection
of
the
testimony
was
that
our
experts
said
it
had
to
get
down
to
130
in
order
for
the
other
remedies
to
be
effective,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
pardon
me?
mr.
donald
specter
there
was
no
expert
--
well,
there
was
one
expert
who
said
maybe
in
the
best
of
circumstances
it
could
get
to
145.
all
the
others
talked
about
130
percent.
mr.
donald
specter
he
was
a
psychologist,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
he
was
a
psychologist
who
has
expertise
in
prison
healthcare.
mr.
donald
specter
he
was
equivocal
on
that
point.
he
thought
--
he
said
that
at
the
outer
reaches
it
might
be
true,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
district
court
has
allowed
the
state
to
come
back
in
at
any
time
to
modify
its
order
and
to
modify
this
percentage
point
if
the
circumstances
changed.
so
–
mr.
donald
specter
it
was
passed,
i
think,
last
year
and
i
think
it
went
into
effect
in
july
of
last
year,
i
believe,
if
that's
what
you
are
referring
to.
mr.
donald
specter
it
has
had
a
marginal
effect
on
reducing
the
population.
there
have
been
no
reports
that
it
has
led
to
an
increase
in
crime,
but
to
get
back
to
my
earlier
point,
and
your
point,
justice
kennedy,
about
the
remedy
and
that
it
should
be
the
least
intrusive
possible,
this
order
is
set
to
take
effect
over
a
two-year
period
and
during
that
two-year
period,
if
mr.
phillips
is
correct
that
the
conditions
are
constitutional
and
that
they
can
deliver
services
at
145
percent,
then
the
state
is
free
to
come
in
and
make
a
motion
to
bring
those
changed
circumstances
to
the
court
and,
if
anything,
this
court
has
been
incredibly
sensitive
to
the
needs
and
desires
of
the
state.
and
it
was
extremely
reluctant
to
enter
this
order
in
the
first
place
and
it
would
bend
over
backwards
to
give
the
state
discretion.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
it's
explicitly
said
145,
but
i
think
it
discussed
the
145
figure
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that
it
didn't
provide
for
healthcare
services.
so
it
discounted
that
a
little
bit
and
went
down
about
7
percent,
but
it
came
close
to
that
figure,
i
believe.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
requires
the
court
to
give
substantial
weight
to
the
public
safety
implications
of
its
decision.
so
under
those
circumstances,
it's
--
under
those
hypothetical
circumstances,
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
in
those
cases,
the
degree
of
public
safety
problems
might
outweigh
the
harm.
that
--
as
you
said,
that's
not
this
case.
they
found
that
we
could
do
it
and
they
--
the
three-judge
panel
found
that
the
state
could
reduce
the
population
safely.
and
there
was
no
suggestion
then
in
the
record
that
this
2
or
4-year
period
would
make
that
much
of
a
difference.
you
have
to
put
the
40,000
or
35,000
figure
in
context.
california
releases
120,000
prisoners
every
year
on
parole.
that's
a
lot
of
prisoners
and
the
findings
of
the
district
courts
are,
even
when
the
california
increases
the
number
of
parolees
in
the
communities,
that
doesn't
increase
the
crime
rate.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
it
depends
on
the
risk
of
the
parolee.
the
high-risk
ones
--
mr.
donald
specter
--well,
overall,
the
risk
is
around
70
percent,
but
for
low-risk
prisoners
the
risk
is
17
percent
who
reviolate.
mr.
donald
specter
the
first
number
when
you
take
all
parolees,
all
together,
it's
70
percent.
mr.
donald
specter
70,
because
--
within
three
years.
that's
what
--
the
situation
we
have
now,
and
that's
the
situation
that
the
governor,
the
secretary,
and
the
court
described
as
a
failure.
with
parole
reform,
you
could
reduce
that
number
in
many
ways,
and
the
court
described
how
you
could
do
that,
but
the
lowest
--
mr.
donald
specter
17
percent
and
california
has
a
risk
assessment
instrument
which
the
court
found
could
be
used
to
make
sure
that
what
happened
in
philadelphia
doesn't
happen
again.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
donald
specter
they
--
but
they
don't
have
to
be
released,
first
off
i
want
to
make
sure
i
emphasize
the
point
that
this
is
a
crowding
reduction
measure.
you
don't
have
to
release
35,000
prisoners.
mr.
donald
specter
or
you
can
divert,
or
you
can
improve
the
parole
system
so
that
parole
violators
don't
commit
so
many
crimes,
if
you
offer
rehabilitation
alternatives,
if
you
provide
a
number
of
diversion
into
the
community.
there
are
a
number
of
options
short
of
releasing
prisoners
and
the
70
percent
figure
concludes
--
mr.
donald
specter
well
based
on
the
experience
in
other
jurisdictions,
the
court
found
we
wouldn't
and
i
wanted
to
say
--
to
clarify
one
point,
your
honor,
the
70
percent
figure
includes
--
doesn't
always
include
crimes.
it
includes
lots
of
technical
parole
violators,
people
who
have
missed
their
appointments,
for
example.
so
it's
not
as
grave
as
some
of
the
figures
that
are
informed
by
the
other
side.
mr.
donald
specter
it's
the
first
one
to
reach
this
court,
obviously.
there
have
been
a
few
others
that
have
been
resolved
by
consent,
as
i
understand
it,
or
not
appealed,
but
just
a
few.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
the
evidence
was,
and
the
court
found
--
and
again,
it's
not
clear
error
that
these
programs
were
more
effective
than
prison
in
reducing
recidivism
and
they
were
less
expensive
and
--
and
that's
part
of
the
reason
why
the
three-judge
panel
concluded
that
a
reduction
in
the
prison
population
wouldn't
increase
crime.
mr.
donald
specter
well
your
honor,
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
donald
specter
well,
i
believe
the
federal
courts
have
an
obligation
to
enforce
the
constitution
and
the
laws.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
my
simple
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
flippant,
but
they're
--
they
have
an
obligation
to
follow
the
federal
law,
the
constitutional
law,
and
other
laws
and
if
they
are
not,
then
the
federal
court
has
an
obligation
to
impose
a
remedy.
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
has
a
choice.
it
can
either
incarcerate
140,000
prisoners
in
a
system
built
for
80,000,
or
it
can
incarcerate
a
lesser
number.
if
it
chooses
to
incarcerate
148,000
prisoners
in
a
space
built
for
80,
it's
going
to
incur
certain
obligations
and
we
believe,
as
i
said
in
the
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
the
state
could
choose
to
use
less
restrictive
punishments,
alternative
punishments,
get
a
better
bang
for
their
buck,
have
more
public
safety,
but
that's
--
if
we
--
if
the
court
imposed
that
kind
of
a
rule,
then
the
state
would
be
here
saying
it's
--
it's
violating
comity
provisions
and
making
policy
choices
for
the
state
which
it
shouldn't.
i
believe
in
this
case,
the
court
gave
the
state
the
maximum
degree
of
flexibility
to
make
all
the
policy
choices
surrounding
--
surrounding
the
incarceration
of
these
prisoners.
you
just
--
the
constitution
prevents
the
state
from
incarcerating
somebody
and
then
not
providing
them
the
basic
medical
care
they
need
to
escape
from
the
prison
and
not
die
before
their
sentence
is
out
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
the
state
can
do
quickly.
for
instance,
it
can
reform
its
parole
system.
it
cannot
re-incarcerate
technical
parole
violators.
it
can--
mr.
donald
specter
--the
state
--
well,
i
just
want
to
remind
you
that
the
governor
proposed
to
the
legislature
that
he
reduced
the
prison
population.
he
said
it
could
be
done
safely
by
the
same
amount,
roughly
37,000
prisoners
in
2
years.
so
what
the
court
found
was
basically
what
the
governor
had
believed
was
safe.
the
5-year
--
the
5-year
period
is
longer
and
the
5-year
period
is
longer
because
it
takes
time
to
construct
the
facilities
that
the
--
that
state
wants
to
construct.
i
believe
that's
the
major
difference
between
the
two
remedies.
but
the
other
methods,
the
good
time
credits,
parole
reform,
diversion,
those
can
be
implemented
very
quickly,
and
those
substantial
reductions
can
be
accomplished
safely
in
that
amount
of
time.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
the
state
--
mr.
donald
specter
i
was
--
mr.
donald
specter
right
and
the
state
has
--
has
really
not
put
up
the
money
to
construct
those
new
prisons.
this
case
has
been
on
going
since
2006
and
they
have
hardly
constructed
anything.
even
if
it
was
a
more
narrow
remedy,
the
court
found
that
construction
wouldn't
be
a
viable
alternative.
my
time
is
up.
