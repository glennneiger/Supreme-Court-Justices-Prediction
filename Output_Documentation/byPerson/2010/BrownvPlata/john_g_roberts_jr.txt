09-1233,
schwarzenegger
versus
plata,
and
the
related
cases,
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
could
you
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question
first?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
see
your
time
is
about
to
expire.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
specter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
let
me
just
keep
track
here.
the
evidence
was
cut
off
when,
in
2008?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
dispute
the
statement
i
have,
it's
in
the
response
to
the
intervenors
that
between
october
2006
and
october
2010
the
population
of
the
adult
facilities
declined
by
14,832
inmates?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
is
not
what
--
that
is
not
what
the
three-judge
district
court
determined.
the
prisoner
litigation
reform
act
requires
that
court
to
give
substantial
weight
to
adverse
impact
on
public
safety.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
when
--
and
then
it
said
to
the
state,
look,
you
come
up
with
a
plan
that
gets
you
to
137.5
in
two
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
state
did,
and
the
state
did
not
say,
emphatically
did
not
say
this
is
not
going
to
have
an
adverse
impact
on
public
safety.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
a
problem
with
negative
there,
but
--
and
what
the
district
court
said,
it
didn't
examine
that.
it
said,
well,
we're
sure
the
state's
not
going
to
do
anything
that
has
an
adverse
impact
on
public
safety.
i
am
looking
at
page
4a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
said
--
and
so
it
did
not
make
those
determinations,
but
the
plra
requires
it
to
determine
that
what
it's
ordering
or
at
least
gives
substantial
weight
to
the
public
safety
issue.
so
isn't
that
a
basis
for
overturning
the
remedy
that's
imposed
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
would.[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
he
want
to
do
it
within
the
two-year
period
the
district
court
ordered?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
right.
now
my
--
my
question
is
specifically
with
respect
to
the
--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--
with
respect
to
the
two-year
plan
--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--
and
i
would
like
an
answer
to
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
i
look
at
this
record,
i
see
that
the
district
court
did
what
was
required
by
the
act
with
respect
to
the
plan
that
it's
ordering.
it
just
simply
said,
oh,
we're
sure
--
i'm
the
state
wouldn't
do
anything
to
hurt
public
safety,
after
telling
the
state
you
have
got
to
give
me
a
plan
in
two
years
that
gets
to
137.5.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
said
we're
sure,
because
we
trust,
i'm
just
quoting
from
4a,
"we
trust
that
the
state
will
comply
with
its
duty
to
ensure
public
safety
as
it
implements
the
constitutionally
required
reduction."
the
state
is
saying
it
cannot
meet
the
137.5
in
two
years
without
an
adverse
impact
on
public
safety.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
justice
sotomayor
has
been
patient.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
you
can
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
you
can
answer,
counsel,
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question
that
i
know
is
not
your
case,
but
let's
say
you
had
the
district
court
entering
an
order
saying
you
have
to
bring
it
down
to
137.5
in
2
years.
that
will
as
a
practical
matter
result
in
the
release
of
40,000
prisoners.
the
state
comes
back
and
makes
a
showing
supported
by
experts
saying,
look,
if
you
give
us
4
years,
we
can
reach
the
figure
without
releasing
any
prisoners.
do
you
think
it
would
violate
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
for
the
district
court
to
say,
no,
i
want
this
done
in
2
years,
not
4
years,
and
we
just
have
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
there
are
going
to
be
40,000
prisoners
out
on
the
streets?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
couldn't
--
what
was
the
first--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
70?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
one
of
the
things
that
concern
me
about
this
type
of
institutional
reform
litigation
is
that
the
state
is
responsible
for
a
lot
of
different
things.
what
happens
when
you
have
this
case,
another
district
court
ordering
the
state
to
take
action
with
respect
to
environmental
damage,
another
court
saying
you
have
got
to
spend
this
much
more
on
education
for
disabled,
another
court
saying
you
have
got
to
spend
this
much
more
on
something
else?
how
does
the
state
sort
out
its
obligations?
does
it
say,
well
i'll
spend
more
money
to
build
prisons,
but
i
will
violate
this
other
district
court
order
saying
i
have
to
spend
money
to
build
water
treatment
plants?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
you
like
your
particular
case.
you
want
the
state
to
say,
this
is
where
i'm
going
to
put
my
money,
but
the
point
is
that
it's
a
bunch
prioritization
that
the
state
has
to
go
through
every
day,
and
now
it's
being
transferred
from
the
state
legislature
to
federal
district
courts
throughout
the
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
i
believe
that
as
well,
counsel.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
have
conflicting
orders
from
different
district
courts
telling
them,
you
have
got
to
comply
with
the
constitution
by
spending
8
billion
here
and
another
court
saying,
i
have
got
another
constitutional
problem
of
my
own,
and
you
have
got
to
spend
8
billion
over
there.
what
is
the
state
supposed
to
do
in
that
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
phillips,
mr.
specter.
the
case
is
submitted.
