mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
what
this
court
has
under
review
today
is
an
extraordinary
and
unprecedented
order
issued
by
a
three-judge
district
court,
requiring
the
release
of
between
36,000
and
45,000
inmates,
currently
incarcerated
in
the
california
penal
system
within
a
two-year
period.
the
order
in
this
particular
case
is
made
particularly
remarkable
because
it
strikes
me
that
at
a
minimum
it
is
extraordinarily
premature.
that
it
may
come
at
some
point
in
this
process
that
an
order,
probably
substantially
smaller
in
scope
than
this
one,
may
become
appropriate,
but
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
order
or
remedy
of
last
resort,
and
what
the
district
court
has
done
here
is
leapfrogged
a
series
of
steps
that
should
have
been
taken
ahead
of
going
this
particular
route.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
absolutely
true,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think,
obviously,
the
length
of
time
you
have
to
wait
in
some
ways
depends
on
what
the
state
of
the
remedial
phase
is
in
the
particular
case.
and
in
this
case
and
in
recognition,
frankly,
of
the
substantial
problems
that
were
inherent
in
the
penal
system
as
it
existed
during
the
1990s
and
up
until
the
early
2000s,
a
receiver
was
appointed,
specifically
in
the
plata
class,
but
there
was
also
a
connection
between
the
receiver
and
the
special
master
even
in
the
coleman
class
before
the
three-judge
panel
was
convened.
and
under
those
circumstances
and
given
the
extraordinary
powers
that
the
receiver
had
been
accorded,
what
should
have
--
the
most
logical
course
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
remedy
of
last
resort
was
to
allow
the
receiver
an
opportunity
to
implement
the
extraordinary
powers
that
were
conferred
upon
him,
and
then
see,
because
if
it
turns
out
that
we
are
making
progress
–
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
characterization
of
what
the
receiver
said.
the
receiver
said
that
at
any
population
he
would
in
fact
get
you
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
no.
that's
not
all
i'm
relying
on.
all
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well
if
you
--
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
what
the
receiver
has
done
over
the
course
of
the
period
of
time
since
his
appointment,
and
particularly
when
the
second
receiver
was
put
in
place.
first
of
all,
a.b.
900
has
been
enacted.
there
is
significant
construction.
there
has
been
ground
broken.
there
are
substantial
facilities
in
place.
second,
the
receiver
has
had
extraordinary
success
in
the
hiring
process.
we
are
at
close
to
90
percent
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
ginsburg,
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case
seems
to
me
as
--
what
is
the
real
cause
of
the
constitutional
violation
here?
and
the
real
cause
of
the
constitutional
violation
here
has
always
been
the
culture
of
disregard
for
the
inmates.
what
the
receiver
was
put
in
place
for,
the
reason
he
was
appointed,
and
properly
so,
this
was
with
the
state's
consent,
this
is
not
over
our
objection,
was
to
change
that
fundamental
culture
and
to
provide,
one;
construction,
to
provide
increased
numbers,
to
provide
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
except
that
since
the
august
8,
2008,
period
of
time,
you
know,
literally
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
have
gone
to
construction
specifically
and
more
than
$4
billion
have
been
spent
on
the
provision
of
healthcare
in
this
particular
system
and
a
great
deal
of
that
is
because
of
the
receiver.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
we
could
get
that
relief
from
the
single-judge
district
court,
unless
you
are
asking
me
to
actually
seek
to
remove
the
entirety
of
the
claim.
i
mean,
the
order
that
says
that
we
have
to
get
to
137.5
percent
of
the
design,
the
designed
capacity
within
two
years
is
a
three-judge
district
court
decision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
that
will
always
be
the
case,
justice
sotomayor.
the
fundamental
question
here
is,
congress
shifted
dramatically,
the
approach
that
you
are
supposed
to
take
as
a
court
of
equity
in
this
context,
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
matter
of
last
resort,
which
would
mean
that
you
would
give
the
receiver
a
full
opportunity
to
do
what
the
receiver--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
but,
justice
breyer,
the
legislature
also
approved
a
smaller,
but
nevertheless
multibillion-dollar
construction
program.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
–
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
they
did
approve
that
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--
and
that
money
is
being
spent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
the
receiver
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it
will
get
you
there
or
not
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
is
the
evidence
that
the
receiver
asked
for
contempt
for
not
getting
the
8
billion
and
withdrew
that
motion,
so
obviously
there
is
some
sense
in
which
the
receiver
is
reasonably
satisfied
with
2.35
billion
as
an
opening
gambit.
but
again,
all
of
this
goes
to
what
is,
at
least
from
my
perspective,
the
fundamental
question
the
court
should
have
evaluated
in
the
first
instance,
which
is,
are
we
ready
yet
to
give
up
hope
at
this
point?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
breyer,
when
the
receiver
says
that,
now
remember
he
says
at
current
population
levels,
he
doesn't
suggest,
and
his
brief
is
very
clear
that
it
doesn't
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
particular
order
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
can
i
just
finish
this?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
the
reality
is
that
the
population
levels
have
dropped
pretty
significantly
since
august,
since
the
trial
in
this
particular
case
and
given
the
actions
by
the
legislature
in
ab
18
and
the
actions
of
the
legislature
in
ab
900,
there
are
both
a
lot
of
expenditures
on
the
table
and
substantial
reductions
in
the
population
size,
and
so
therefore,
even
under
the
receiver's
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's
down
to
around,
as
i
understand
it,
about
147,000
from
a
high
of
around
165
to
170,000,
and
it
has
dropped,
as
we
know,
because
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
good
time
credits.
there
has
been
a
significant
number
of
transfers.
i
mean,
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
governor's
proclamation
(voice
overlap).
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it
unlikely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
is
a
core
sort
of
federalism
answer
and
then
a
basic
sort
of
factual
point
to
be
made
here.
let
me
make
the
second
one
first,
and
then
i
want
to
come
back
to
the,
what
you
may
regard
as
rhetorical,
but
nevertheless
i
think
important,
which
is
that
when
we
made
our
initial
proposal
to
the
three-judge
court,
suggesting
what
we
thought
would
be
a
reasonable
reduction
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
it
was
met
with
both
a
motion
for
contempt
and
summary
rejection
out
of
hand,
notwithstanding
that
there
was
improvement
in
both
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
so
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
i
think
this
--
this
goes
to
the
federalism
point.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know.
i
--
you
know,
if
--
balancing
all
of
the
policies
that
the
state
has
to
take
into
account,
can
it
get
there
and
is
that
in
the
best
interest
of
the
state
of
california,
if
it
is,
yes,
then
we
can
get
there.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely!
and
california
recognizes
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'll
do
my
best.
thank
you,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
mean,
first
of
all,
if
you
look
at
the
receiver's
2009
death
review
which
came
out
in
september
2010,
it
specifically
says
that
there
has
been
a
significant
downward
trend
over
the
past
4
years.
the
suicides
--
the
25
suicides
in
2009
were
66
percent
of
the
average
for
the
preceding
3
years,
and
the
9
homicides
were
60
percent
of
the
average.
there
have
been
significant
improvements.
and
the
more
important
point
in
response
to
your
specific
question,
justice
sotomayor,
is
that
the
record
in
this
case
was
cut
off
in
august
of
2008,
and
so
what
we
have
are
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i'm
not
sure
we've--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
kennedy,
i
agree
with
everything
you
say
except
--
and
i
even
agree
with
the
last
statement
because,
you
know,
you
needed
a
significant
remedy,
there's
no
question
about
it,
but
you
got
a
significant
remedy
when
the
receiver
was
appointed
in
2005
and
implemented
a
program
in
2006.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there's
no
--
justice
kagan,
there
is
no
specific
time
frame.
i
mean,
obviously
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
comply
with
the
receiver's
orders
and
to
bring
ourselves
ultimately
into
compliance
with
the
constitution,
and
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
that's
--
justice
kennedy,
you
know,
given
all
of
the
other
constraints,
et
cetera
--
again,
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
what
you
do
under
the
hammer
of
a
district
court
order,
which
is
what
we
have
under
these
circumstances,
and
what
the
state
will
do.
that
said,
the
state
is
absolutely
committed.
i
mean
the
--
again,
to
go
back
to
what
is
the
root
cause
of
the
constitutional
violation,
it's
not
overcrowding.
i
mean,
when
california
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
mentally
ill
in
the
1990s,
the
prisons
weren't
crowded.
it
was
because
there
was
a
fundamental
lack
of
attentiveness
to
medical
care
under
those
circumstances
and
that
is
unfortunate,
to
be
sure
more
than
that.
but
that
was
the
reason,
to
go
back
to
your
point,
justice
kennedy,
that's
why
the,
receiver,
which
is
an
extraordinary
remedy,
to
confer
upon
a
private
individual
the
entire
authority
to
run
the
california
department
of
corrections,
not
just
simply
a
facility
or
anything
like
that,
but
the
entire
department
of
corrections'
medical
health
provision,
is
incredible.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
justice
ginsburg,
even
if
you
accept
that,
and
i
don't
think
that's
precisely
how
i
would
interpret
what
the
receiver
said
under
these
circumstances
anyway,
but
even
if
you
accept
that,
the
idea
of
a
137.5
percent
designed
cap
that
has
to
be
implemented
within
fewer
than
two
years
is
a
remedy
that
is
neither
necessary
nor
sufficient
and
is
not
aimed
at
the
specific
class.
it
doesn't
remedy
the
specific
federal
rights
as
required
by
the
prisoners
litigation
reform
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
the
--
the
fundamental
point
here
is
that
it
may
eventually
be
that
you
have
to
get
to
that
stage,
but
if
you
look
at
the
receiver's
reports
since
august
2008,
which
consistently
analyzed
this
issue,
and
they
say,
“we
have
been
able
successfully
to
bring
in
very
qualified
personnel,
and
we
have
significantly
larger
numbers.
we
know
there
is
construction
in
place.
it
may
not
be
as
substantial
as
what
i
originally
proposed,
it
is
nevertheless
very
significant”
and
congress
was
very
explicit
that
the
remedy
of
a
prisoner
release
order
should
be
the
remedy
of
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
say
that
the
prisoners
litigation
reform
act
has
a
series
of
very
specific
requirements
that
the
federal
court
has
to
comply
with
and
that
in
deciding
to
go
to
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
first
instance,
you
have
to
examine
the
orders
that
are
in
place
and
whether
those
orders
have
had
a
reasonable
time
within
which
to
operate.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that,
first
of
all,
i'm
not
sure
that
is
consistent
with
the
language,
that’s
primary
cause
of
the
constitutional
violation,
not
the
primary
impediment
to
the
implementation
of
a
specific
remedy.
so
i
think
that
is
still
a
difficult
and
open
question
as
to
how
to
proceed,
but
it
still
strikes
me
that
the
sequence
that
congress
envisions
and
the
one
that
would
make
the
most
sense
and
ultimately
the
one
that
hopefully
would
accommodate
both
the
plaintiffs'
interests
and
the
state's
interests,
and
the
department
of
corrections'
interests,
is
to
allow
the
receiver
to
stay
on
a
course
that
candidly
i
think
will
in
fact
get
you
there.
i
mean,
again,
one
of
the
real
flaws
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
is
nobody
doubts
for
a
moment
that
there
have
been
very
significant
violations
of
constitutional
rights
years
gone
by,
and
indeed
a
failure
on
the
mental
health
side
ultimately
to
get
you
--
get
to
the
point
where
we
are
in
fact
providing
a
significant
remedy.
the
reality
is
that
in
the
course
of
the
last
three
to
four
years
under
the
guidance
of
the
--
of
the
receiver,
who
coordinates
with
the
special
master
on
the
mental
health
side,
and
does
it
with
the
cooperation
of
the
state
of
california,
there
have
been
significant
--
there
has
been
significant
movement
in
the
right
direction
and
if
the
court
had
not
jumped
the
gun
and
said,
look,
we're
not
going
to
--
we're
not
going
to
let
that
part
play
itself
out,
we
are
going
to
leap
ahead
and
go
to
a
three-judge
court
and
go
to
the
prisons
with
the
prisoner
release
order,
this
process
would
have
played
itself
out
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
--
that
is
true,
justice
alito.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
were
not
allowed
to
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you
know,
i'm
a
long-time
believer
that
amicus
briefs
is
pretty
much
open
season
in
terms
of
anything
you
want
to
present
on
them,
but
i
mean,
obviously
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--
clearly
a
better
system
–
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor,
that's
obviously
not
appropriate
and
it's
one
of
the
things
that
we've
complained
about.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
to
be
sure,
although,
candidly,
we
had
--
we
had
referred
to
some
of
those
same
statements
even
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
this
litigation.
those
have
been
part
of
the
case
for
quite
some
time.
so
i
--
i
don't
know
what
motivated
the
special
master
to
file
an
out-of-time
brief
--
or
i
mean,
the
receiver
to
file
an
out-of-time
brief,
but
i
understand
--
but
you
know,
we
didn't
object
to
it
so
long
as
the
court
was
of
a
mind
to
hear
from
the
receiver.
but
i
do
think
the
most
important
part
of
that
though
to
keep
in
mind
in
this
context
is
the
receiver
didn't
ask
for
this
court
to
affirm.
the
receiver
simply
clarified
certain
statements
that
had
been
made
and
tried
to
say,
as
justice
alito
described,
put
them
into
some
kind
of
context
and
that's
--
and
that's
fine,
and
we
obviously
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
--
with
that
particular
presentation.
but
i
do
think
to
say
that
the
receiver
has
insisted
that
he
cannot
get
to
a
constitutionally
permissible
result
without
the
order
that
has
been
imposed
in
this
particular
case
is
--
is
simply
not
consistent
with
either
the
record
and
it's
certainly
not
consistent
with
that
amicus
brief.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
experts
may
--
certainly
reached
that
specific
conclusion,
but
this
court
has
recognized
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
again,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
very,
very,
very
big
difference
between
what
do
you
need
to
accomplish
in
order
to
remedy
whatever
--
whatever
the
constitutional
violation
is,
recognizing
in
the
first
instance
that
the
biggest
element
of
an
eighth
amendment
violation
is
the
deliberate
indifference
prong,
which
absolutely
seems
to
me
to
have
been
completely
eliminated
by
the
conduct
of
the
state
over
the
course
of
the
last
three
to
four
years.
there
is
no
evidence
–
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
depends
i
suppose
on
some
ways
on
how
you
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
the
three-judge
panel
shouldn't
have
been
convened,
that
would
be
one
outcome.
if
the
court
concludes
that
it
was
appropriate
to
convene
it,
but
137.5
percent
is
not
narrowly
tailored,
it
would
be
a
different
one.
either
way,
it
will
go
back
obviously
to
a
court
of
equity.
the
receiver
is
in
place.
the
receiver
has
a
comprehensive
plan
in
place
which
he
is
implementing
as
we
speak.
one
of
the
things
that
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
400
million
of
it
has
already
been
spent.
the
rest
of
it
has
already
been
earmarked
for
this
particular
purpose,
and
there
is
--
and
the
expectation
from
the
state
of
california
is
that
money
is
going
forward.
construction
is,
as
we
speak,
under
way
and
the
one
thing
we
do
know
is
that
every
time
the
receiver
asks
for
a
check
he
gets
one.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
receiver
is
saying
it's
not
etched
in
stone.
i
understand
that,
but
our
assumption
and
our
expectation
and
our
belief
is
that
that
money
is
going
to
be
used
for
construction.
there
are
projects
that
are
finished.
there
are
projects
that
are
underway,
and
there
are
projects
that
are
scheduled
to
begin
within
the
next
six
weeks,
all
of
which
will
be
funded
out
of
that
$2.35
billion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
asked
for
additional
information,
to
be
sure,
but
the
expectation,
again,
from
the
governor,
both
from
this
governor
and
the
governor-elect,
is
that
that
money
will
ultimately
be
approved
and
that
that
facility
would
be
built
and
we
are
moving
along
very
rapidly
to
get
that
construction
under
way,
because
we
are
talking
about
enormous
facilities
under
these
particular
circumstances,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
fundamental
problem
with
the
fact-finding
in
this
--
well,
there
are
actually
two
fundamental
problems.
first
of
all,
remember
that
the
receiver
gets
appointed
and
then
three
months
later
you
get
a
motion
for
a
three-judge
court.
the
three-judge
court
convenes
itself
before
the
receiver
has
even
finalized
the
comprehensive
plan
to
bring
everybody
into
compliance
in
the
first
instance.
so
the
reality
is
that
is
the
fundamental
legal
error
i'm
asking
this
court
to
correct.
but
even
if
you
get
beyond
that
and
you
are
looking
at
the
primary
cause
analysis,
it
seems
to
me
that's
--
that's
at
most,
at
best,
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
and
it's
the
kind
of
standard
that
this
court
ought
to
analyze
to
determine
in
the
first
instance
and
on
an
independent
review
whether
or
not
the
overcrowding
is
"the
primary
cause
of
the
violation."
and
what
makes
that
inquiry
particularly
appropriate
for
this
court,
as
opposed
to
simply
slavishly
adhering
and
deferring
to
the
district
court
in
this
circumstance,
is
that
the
district
court
arbitrarily
cut
off
the
record
in
august
of
2008
and
there
have
been
enormous
developments
since
then
and
there
were
enormous
developments
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
is
a
huge
difference
between
not
allowing
formal
tours
and
all
of
the
rigamarole
that
goes
with
that,
which
is
what
the
state
specifically
objected
to,
but
what
the
state
wanted
to
do
and
what
the
intervenors
on
our
side
in
even
greater
vehemence
wanted
to
do
was
to
bring
forward
evidence
that
proved
that
in
the
interim
period
of
time
there
have
been,
in
fact,
significant
improvements.
as
i
sit
here
today,
justice
kennedy,
you
said
it
is
conceded
that
we
are
in
constitutional
violation.
it
is
conceded
that
we
have
been
in
constitutional
violation.
i
don't
know
whether
today
we
are
in
violation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
justice
ginsburg,
i
understand
what
the
ordinary
rule
would
be
of
a
court
of
equity
dealing
with
a
constitutional
violation,
but
we
are
talking
about
an
order
entered
under
the
prisoners
litigation
reform
act,
and
it's
quite
clear,
the
statute
couldn't
be
any
plainer,
that
it
shifts
the
burden
significantly
onto
the
plaintiff
when
you
are
going
to
go
for
a
remedy
as
extreme
as
insisting
that
somewhere
between
potentially
36,000
and
45,000
inmates
be
released
within
a
two-year
period
of
time.
again,
if
you
go
back,
the
receiver
has
not
--
at
the
time
that
all
of
this
took
place,
the
receiver
had
been
appointed.
the
receiver
had
devised
a
plan.
the
receiver
is
currently
spending
an
enormous
amount
of
money,
$4
billion
on
healthcare,
to
get
--
to
get
the
system
moving
in
the
right
direction,
with
the
right
attitude,
in
order
to
bring
ourselves
without
question
into
constitutional
compliance.
the
truth
is
we
haven't
really
had
an
assessment
of
where
we
are
in
the
constitutional
compliance
spectrum.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
coleman
is
obviously
a
much
--
a
much
more
serious
problem,
i
don't
doubt
that,
but
it
seems
--
and
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
ultimately
that
coleman
ought
to
go
back
for
another
analysis
based
on
the
problems
there,
i
could
understand
that
and
it
would
be
a
very
different
prisoner
release
order
under
those
circumstances
because
then
you
would
have
to
take
out
all
of
the
evidence
with
respect
to
plata
and
let
that
play
out.
but
even
that
it
seems
to
me
would
be
a
mistake
under
these
circumstances
where
the
special
master
and
receiver
have
been
in
a
sense
joined
at
the
hip
in
a
variety
of
ways,
it
only
makes
sense,
because
the
receiver
is
controlling
the
provision
of
medical
care
in
the
cdcr
and
the
special
master
is
taking
care
of
or
trying
to
promote
a
very
small
slice
of
that.
so
in
the
scheme
of
things,
as
you
might
expect,
the
receiver
consistently
gets
the
ultimate
authority
to
make
the
decisions
to
help
provide
the
kind
of
resources,
both
in
quality
and
quantity
and
staff
and
construction
and
access
to
healthcare.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
the
district
court
--
because
the
district
court
could
not
have
been
plainer
and
when
the
intervenor's
counsel
stood
up
in
the
opening
statement
and
said,
i
want
to
start
talking
about
the
beneficial
changes
and
where
the
status
is
today
as
opposed
to
where
it
was
way
back
when,
the
three-judge
court,
at
least
one
of
the
member
of
the
three-judge
court
said,
“we
have
been
as
clear
as
we
can
be
that
we
are
not
entertaining
any
evidence
on
that
point.”
so
the
notion
of
coming
forward
with
a
proffer,
while
technically
it
might
have
been,
was
clearly
a
futile
act
and
we
had
already
annoyed
the
judges
on
our
side
by
even
making
reference
to
it.
so
i
don't
think
it's
an
appropriate
response
to
say
that
we
should
have
put
forward
more,
because
the
(voice
pverlap)
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
justice
sotomayor,
there
is,
to
my
mind
at
least,
a
complete
disconnect
by
saying,
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
exactly
where
the
constitutional
violation
is
today.
we
are
not
going
to
get
into
that.
we
are
just
going
to
assume
there
is
a
constitutional
violation.
now
prove
to
me
that
the
remedy,
you
know,
what
remedy
will
or
will
not
work
under
those
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me
the
exact
opposite
is
the
way
to
do
it.
you
determine
where
the
constitutional
violation
is
–
(voice
overlap)
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
few
points.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
state
of
the
record
and
what
was
proffered
and
what
was
not
proffered,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
at
2085,
there
is
a
specific
proffer
that
is
made
by
the
interveners
in
that
context
--
i
mean,
i'm
sorry,
there
is
a
specific
proffer
made
by
the
state
of
the
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
2085,
that
is
volume
6
of
it
and
it's
at
that
point
where
the
plaintiffs,
the
intervening
plaintiffs
say
we
would
like
to
put
on
evidence
of
institutional
violations,
and
judge
karlton
says
twice
this
court
has
said,
we
will
not
receive
that
evidence.
you
have
made
a
clear
--
as
clear
a
record
as
you
can;
please
don't
waste
our
time
and
then
later
at
2338,
which
is
again
in
volume
6,
where
we
enter
--
mr.
desseimer,
who
is
the
assistant
secretary
of
cdcr
in
charge
of
healthcare,
he
specifically
said
--
i've
read
this
december
declaration
and
it
will
not
be
received,
to
the
extent
that
it
says
the
state
is
in
compliance.
so
we
have
made
our
efforts
and
we
were
rebuffed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
believe
the
actual
declaration
is
in
the
record.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
mean,
we
made
that
submission
to
the
court
and
we
--
we
believe
that
we
could
comply
with
it.
that
said
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well
--
well,
i
mean
the
plaintiff's
counsel
talks
about
all
of
the
things
that
you
had
can
do,
and
if
you
--
if
you
look
at
70a
of
the
--
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix,
it
specifically
says,
there
is
a
line,
above
the
line
we
can
implement,
and
that
will
get
you
about
16,000
inmates
and
below
the
line
you
need
legislation
in
order
to
implement
these
things.
but
the
reality
is
that
anytime
you
say
you
are
going
to
release
30,000
inmates
in
a
very
compressed
period
of
time,
i
guarantee
you
that
there
is
going
to
be
more
crime
and
people
are
going
to
die
on
the
streets
of
california.
i
mean
that
--
there
is
not
way
out
of
that
particular
box.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
so,
but
i'm
still
concerned
because
the
district
court
in
this
specific
says,
we
have
not
evaluated
the
--
the
safety
impact
of
each
of
the
state's
--
of
the
elements
the
elements
of
the
state's
proposed
plan,
and
it
seems
to
me
they
had
an
obligation
to
do
that.
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
with
respect
to
justice
kennedy's
question
is
that
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
137.5
makes
any
sense
whatsoever.
that
is
a
pulled
out
of
the
air
number.
theirs
was
aspirational.
none
of
that
is
based
on
what
is
the
constitutional
violation
that
exists
at
the
time
you
adopt
that
particular
percentage.
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
the
entire
problem
with
this
--
this
exercise,
which
is
to
say
we
are
going
to
fix
this
across
the
board,
rather
than
what
would
make
much
more
sense,
which
is
to
evaluate
these
matters
facility
by
facility,
to
evaluate
these
matters
on
the
basis
of
various
discrete
elements
of
how
you
can
reduce
the
prison
population,
and
to
do
it
in
--
in
conjunction
with
a
receiver
who
is
in
place
who
can
help
to
implement
this
in
a
very
systematic
way
and
that
will
get
us
to
where
we
want
to
get
to.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
the
district
court's
order
said
you
are
going
to
have
to
reach
137.5
percent
in
two
years.
that's
the
categorical
rule,
and
the
first
time
we
went
in
to
suggest
something
above
137
and
a
half,
judge
henderson
said,
"i'm
not
hearing
that".
