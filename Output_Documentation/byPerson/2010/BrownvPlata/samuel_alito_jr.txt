mr.--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
this
talk
about
what
the
receiver
may
think
can
be
done
seems
a
little
bit
perplexing
to
me
because
the
receiver
did
not
testify
before
the
three-judge
court,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
were
not
allowed
to
question
him?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
now
he
has
submitted
what
is
styled
in
amicus
brief
where
he
doesn't
address
issues
of
law.
he
explains
his
views
about
--
he
tries
to
explain
prior
statements
and
supplement
those
prior
statements.
is
that
proper?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
true?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
a
witness
testify
--
can
a
witness
submit
an
amicus
brief
that
consists
of
an
affidavit?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
you
explain
what
the
connection
is
between
the
137.5
percent
figure
and
the
constitutional
violations
relating
to
the
provision
of
medical
care
in
general
and
treatment
for
--
for
mental
illness?
my
understanding
of
the
137.5
percent
figure
is
that
that
has
to
do
with
the
total
number
of
prisoners
in
the
--
in
the
system
in
relation
to
designed
capacity,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
what
does
the
ruling
--
that
doesn't
speak
to
the
number
of
personnel
who
are
available
in
the
system
to
attend
to
medical
needs
or
mental
illness?
it
doesn't
speak
to
the
extent
of
the
facilities
that
are
available
for
those
purposes.
it
seems
to
be
--
there
seems
to
be
a
disconnect
between
those
two.
could
you
explain
why
that
is
narrowly
tailored?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
see,
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
you
can
have
a
--
could
you
not
have
a
prison
where
the
cells
are
somewhat
crowded
and
137.5
percent
of
designed
capacity
is
not
--
is
not
unconstitutional
in
itself,
is
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
could
have
a
prison
where
the
--
the
cells
themselves
are
crowded,
and
yet
there
are
other
facilities
available
for
medical
care
and
plenty
of
staff
to
attend
to
those
things.
so
what's
the
connection?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
why
order
the
release
of
around
40,000
prisoners,
many
of
whom,
perhaps
the
great
majority
of
whom,
are
not
going
to
be
within
the
class
in
either
of
these
lawsuits?
why
order
the
release
of
all
those
people,
rather
than
ordering
the
provision
of
the
construction
of
facilities
for
medical
care,
facilities
to
treat
mental
illness,
hiring
of
staff
to
treat
mental
illness?
why
not
go
directly
to
the
problem
rather
than
address
what
seems
to
be
a
different
issue
altogether?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
all
they
do
is
to
build
more
cells,
they
are
not
going
to
address
the
problem.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
still
don't
get
it.
you're
saying
that
they
were
ordered
to
do
a
variety
of
things
that
directly
addressed
the
problem
and
they
didn't
comply.
so
as
a
--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
provide
some
kind
of
remedy
we
are
going
to
order
something
else
that
doesn't
address
the
problems
that
these
lawsuits
aim
at
addressing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
is
a
very
indirect
way
of
addressing
the
problem
and
it
has
collateral
consequences.
if
--
if
i
were
a
citizen
of
california,
i
would
be
concerned
about
the
release
of
40,000
prisoners
and
i
don't
care
what
you
term
it,
a
prison
release
order
or
whatever
the
--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--
terminology
you
used
was.
if
40,000
prisoners
are
going
to
be
released,
you
really
believe
that
if
you
were
to
come
back
here
two
years
after
that,
you
would
be
able
to
say,
they
haven't
--
they
haven't
contributed
to
an
increase
in
crime
--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--
in
the
state
of
california?
in
the
--
in
the
amicus
brief
that
was
submitted
by
a
number
of
states,
there
is
an
extended
discussion
of
the
effect
of
one
prisoner
release
order
with
which
i
am
familiar,
and
that
was
in
philadelphia
and
after
a
period
of
time
they
tallied
up
what
the
cost
of
that
was,
the
number
of
murders,
the
number
of
rapes,
the
number
of
armed
robberies,
the
number
of
assaults
--
you
don't
--
that's
not
going
to
happen
in
california?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
true
that
in
one
of
the
main
programs
that
was
cited
as
providing
a
safeguard
is
evidence-based
rehabilitation
programs?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
general
record
on
the
success
of
rehabilitation
efforts?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
did
congress
think
when
it
enacted
the
sentencing
format?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
recidivism
rate
for
those
parolees?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
general,
what
is
the
recidivism
rate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
lowest?
it's
17
percent.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
understood
that
of
the
low-risk,
if
only
the
low-risk
people
are
released,
around
3,000
of
them
are
going
to
commit
another
crime.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
don't
have
to
be
released
if
you
can
build
enough
cells
--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
17
percent
figure
goes
exactly
to
my
concern.
this
is
going
to
have
--
it
seems
likely
this
is
going
to
have
an
effect
on
public
safety
and
the
experts
can
testify
to
whatever
they
want,
but
you
know
what,
if
this
order
goes
into
effect,
we
will
see.
we
will
see,
and
the
people
of
california
will
see.
are
there
more
crimes
or
are
there
not?
