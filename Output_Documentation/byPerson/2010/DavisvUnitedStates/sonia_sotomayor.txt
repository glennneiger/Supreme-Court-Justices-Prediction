justice
sonia
sotomayor
you've
just
raised
the
question
of
qualified
immunity
and
the
similarities.
there
is
one
problem
that
i
have
with
the
regime
that
you
are
suggesting,
which
is
that
because
laws
differ
among
circuits,
now
we've
created
a
regime
where
we
say
if
the
law
was
clear
or
if
there
was
law
on
this
issue
in
your
circuit,
and
the
police
officer
relied
on
it,
the
exclusionary
rule
won't
apply;
but
if
the
law
was
uncertain
or
not
clear
in
another
circuit,
then
the
exclusionary
rule
does
apply.
there's
something
illogical
about
permitting
that
kind
of
difference
to
control
the
outcome
of
suppression.
are
you
through
the
back
door
trying
to
get
in
a
qualified
immunity
thing?
if
any
police
officer
has
a
reasonable
cause
to
believe
their
conduct
didn't
violate
the
constitution,
then
no
suppression?
that
is
what
it
sounds
like
your
brief
is
ultimately
suggesting.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there's
no
value
in
your
mind
to
the
fact,
as
your
adversary
is
saying
--
i
don't
--
i
haven't
found
one
case
previously
by
this
court
where
it
has
applied
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
finding
by
the
court
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
have
you?
it's
never
been
done
in
any
case,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
what
we're
doing
is
sort
of
--
your
adversary
is
right,
we're
returning
to
linkletter,
aren't
we?
we're
sort
of
saying
it's
going
to
apply,
the
exclusionary
rule
is
going
to
apply
in
some
cases,
but
not
all.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
talking
about
what
happened
before
then.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we're
going
to
have
the
exclusionary
rule
apply
sometimes
but
not
other
times.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
if
there's
a
circuit
split,
how
do
we
encourage
police
officers
to
be
careful
about
the
fourth
amendment?
there's
a
presumption
somehow
that
because
a
circuit
precedent
exists
that
says
it's
okay
to
do
this,
that
police
officers
have
to
do
this.
i
don't
necessarily
believe
that.
if
there's
a
circuit
split
and
a
police
officer
knows
that
other
circuits
are
saying
this
is
unconstitutional,
why
are
we
taking
away
the
deterrent
effect
of
having
thoughts
occur
to
the
officer
about
thinking
through
whether
there's
a
better
way
and
a
legal
way
to
do
things?
with
respect
to
the
fourth
amendment,
we've
built
--
your
adversary
is
right,
we've
built
in
so
many
exceptions,
and
including
in
this
case
the
inventory
search,
that
the
officers
have
many
different
ways
of
doing
things
than
merely
doing
what
this
particular
court
thought
was
legal
or
this
circuit.
so
i
guess
my
question
is,
when
there's
a
circuit
split,
why
are
we,
as
justice
kennedy
is
saying,
giving
protection
to
the
circuit
that's
plain
wrong
and
to
the
officer
who
chose
to
follow
that
advice?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they're
going
to
be
protected
--
they're
going
to
be
protected
from
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--meaning
they're
going
to
get
qualified
immunity
from
any
personal
liability.
