mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
the
exclusionary
rule
has
severe
consequences
for
the
truth-seeking
function
of
a
criminal
trial,
this
court
has
restricted
its
application
to
those
situations
in
which
it's
necessary
to
further
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
namely
to
shape
police
conduct.
the
court
has
repeatedly
rejected
efforts
to
expand
the
exclusionary
rule
to
serve
other
purposes,
such
as
schooling
judges
who
issue
warrants
on
the
need
to
respect
the
fourth
amendment,
reminding
legislatures
about
their
obligations
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
for
other
purposes
such
as
to
preserve
judicial
integrity.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
let
me
give
two
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
rule
that
the
eleventh
circuit
adopted
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
only
rule
before
the
court,
involves
a
situation
in
which
there
is
binding
appellant
precedent
that
instructs
the
officer,
tells
the
officer,
what
you're
about
to
do
complies
with
the
fourth
amendment.
the
state
of
the
law
in
arizona
would
not
necessarily
have
risen
to
that
level,
in
light
of
the
dissonance
in
that
court's
opinions,
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
opinions,
about
the
reach
and
scope
of
belton.
so
the
question
about
whether
the
rule
that
we're
urging
here
would
have
applied
in
arizona
is
a
separate
question
from
the
one
that
the
eleventh
circuit
resolved.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
gant
obtained
relief.
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
gant
limited
to
the
fourth
amendment
question,
and
arizona
never
raised
any
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
in
that
case,
so
the
court
did
not
address
the
good
faith
issue.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
logic
of
our
position
would
be
that,
to
the
extent
that
gant
was
seeking
belton
to
be
overruled,
he
would
not
be
able
to
impugn
the
actions
of
the
officers
who
relied
on
it.
to
the
extent
that
he
was
doing
what
he
actually
did
do
and
which
this
court's
opinion
in
gant
accepted,
which
is
to
say
that
the
gant
opinion,
that
the
belton
opinion
did
not
resolve
the
fact
pattern
in
gant,
he
would
not
be
automatically
governed
by
the
good
faith
exception.
and
as
a
result,
gant
is
really
the
best
illustration
of
how
unusual
it
is
for
a
lawyer
to
come
to
this
court
and
say,
please
outright
overrule
a
fourth
amendment
decision.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
kagan,
i
believe
the
court
could
grant
that
petition,
although
it's
highly
likely
that
any
criminal
defendant
who
filed
it
would
couple
it
with
a
claim
that
this
court
should
either
reverse,
modify,
or
limit
any
holding
that
came
out.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
certainly
the
court
would
have
article
iii
authority,
because
it's
always
free
to
limit,
modify
or
abrogate
one
of
its
precedents,
including
a
holding,
if
one
issued
from
this
decision,
that
the
good
faith
rule
applies
when
the
court
overrules
its
decision.
litigants
can
all
the
time
be
faced
with
impossible
arguments
under
existing
precedent,
but
that
doesn't
preclude
this
court's
article
iii
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
challenges
to
that
precedent.
that's
indeed
the
very
premise
of
petitioner's
argument.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
it
illustrates
why
there
is
no
article
iii
impediment.
now,
this
court
may
prudentially
be
reluctant
to
take
a
case
in
which
it
knows
that
its
resolution
of
the
fourth
amendment
issue
would
not
dictate
a
reversal
of
the
judgment,
even
if
the
fourth
amendment
issue
went
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
but
it
is
not
that
dissimilar
from
the
situation
in
qualified
immunity,
when
there
is
no
law
on
the
books
that
governs
an
issue
and
a
petitioner
asks
the
court
to
resolve
the
fourth
amendment
issue.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
would
be
remote,
but
not
zero.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
sotomayor,
we're
not
kind
--
trying
to
come
in
through
the
back
door
with
qualified
immunity
as
a
standard
in
this
case.
if
we
ever
were
to
urge
that,
it
would
be
through
the
front
door.
we
would
make
the
argument
overtly.
this
case
doesn't
involve
that
issue.
judge
kravitch's
opinion
for
the
eleventh
circuit
very
carefully
distinguished
between
cases
in
which
governing
precedent
instructed
the
officers,
your
conduct
is
lawful
if
you
do
this,
from
cases
in
which
the
law
is
unclear
and
there
is
no
governing
precedent.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
directly
under
the
exclusionary
rule.
united
states
v.
peltier
considered
the
factors
that
now
go
into
the
good
faith
exception
under
the
rubric
of
then-prevailing
retroactivity
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
returning
to
linkletter,
justice
sotomayor,
because
linkletter
was
an
across-the-board
rule
that
said
that
this
court
had
the
authority
to
render--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--before--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
true,
but
that's
a
direct
consequence
of
the
logic
of
the
good
faith
exception
itself;
and
the
considerations
that
had
informed
this
court's
retroactivity
jurisprudence
in
the
peltier
decision
were
taken
out
of
the
law
of
retroactivity
when
the
court
decided
griffith
v.
kentucky;
but
those
same
considerations
became
relevant
to
the
good
faith
exception,
which
is
tied
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
need
to
deter
police
misconduct
because
the
police
have
disregarded
the
governing
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
nine
of
the
people
who
will
understand
it
are
on
this
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
an
optimist.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
principle
is
very
straightforward.
the
principle
is
that
the
exclusionary
rule
applies
only
when
it
can
deter
police
misconduct.
when
police
rely
on
a
warrant
issued
by
a
magistrate,
a
statute
or
a
judicial
decision
issued
by
a
court
of
appeals
that
governs
their
conduct,
they
are
not
making
a
decision
about
what
the
fourth
amendment
requires.
they
are
following
a
different
actor
in
the
system,
and
this
court
has
held
that
there
is
no
deterrent
value
to
suppress
evidence
with
an
important
cost
to
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
criminal
trial,
which
is
why,
even
if
it
makes
for
a
simpler
rule,
the
court
does
not
automatically
suppress
evidence
just
to
achieve
simplicity.
it
does--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
would
be
an
extremely
simple
system.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
in
this
case,
because
this
case
represents
only
an
application
of
existing
doctrine
in
the
court
with
respect
to
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
defendant
in
these
cases
is
not
the
object
of
the
court's
protection.
i
think,
as
justice
kagan's
question
made
clear,
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
a
personal
individual
right.
it's
not
a
constitutional
right
at
all.
it
is
a
remedy
that
this
court
has
devised,
not
to
protect
the
defendant's
interests
as
such.
the
fourth
amendment
violation
has
happened
out
of
court.
it
cannot
be
repaired.
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
future
conduct
by
other
counterparts
of
that
police
officer
or
the
police
officer
himself,
so
that
when
he
confronts
the
situation
in
the
future
he
will
be
more
solicitous
of
fourth
amendment
rights.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
sotomayor,
we
don't
expect
police
officers
to
attempt
to
define
the
content
of
the
fourth
amendment
on
their
own.
they
are
recipients
of
the
status
of
the
law
from
the
courts
that
govern
their
activities;
training
programs
will
be
instituted
based
on
that
law.
i'm
sure
that
careful
training
programs
will
advise
officers
that
there
may
be
some
legal
risk
if
there's
a
circuit
split,
and
that
a
decision
may
ultimately
be
reversed;
but
we
don't
expect
police
departments
to
try
to
make
the
fourth
amendment
decision
on
their
own.
and
there's
some
sound--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
but
the
reason
that
the
fourth
amendment
balance
has
been
struck
in
any
given
way
in
a
particular
court
is
because
that
is
felt
to
be
the
reasonable
way
for
officers
to
operate.
in
other
words--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
scalia,
that's
exactly
right.
the
officers
are
seeking
to
protect
the
public
interest,
and
by
not
taking
advantage
of
decisions
in
their
circuits
that
explain
that
certain
behavior
is
reasonable,
they
can
be
putting
the
public
interest
at
risk
by
relinquishing
procedures
that
have
been
held
to
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment
and
yet
allow
the
police
to
solve
crime
or
to
arrest
suspects.
now,
there's
been
a
lot
of
discussion
in
petitioner's
argument
about
the
need
to
provide
an
incentive
to
counsel
to
raise
fourth
amendment
challenges
to
existing
precedent.
i
think
it's
useful
at
the
outset
to
look
a
little
bit
empirically
at
that
question,
because
some
members
of
the
court
have
expressed
concern
about
that
possibility.
from
as
best
as
i
can
tell,
this
court
has
not
overruled
one
of
its
fourth
amendment
precedents
in
a
manner
that
favored
defendants'
interests
since
1969.
despite
whatever
incentives
may
have
existed
as
a
result
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
defendants
will
typically
understand
that
stare
decisis
is
the
normal
course
that
this
court
follows,
and
as
a
result,
they
are
highly
likely
to
structure
their
arguments
in
a
manner
that
will
seek
to
distinguish,
limit,
or
undermine
a
precedent
rather
than
calling
for
its
outright
overruling.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
alito,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
this
court
from
inventing
that
exception.
that
exception
would
serve
the
purpose
of
encouraging
litigants
to
ask
the
court
to
overrule
its
decisions
and
thereby
to
receive
a
benefit
when
they
do
so.
if
it's
limited
to
the
first
individual
who
actually
succeeds
in
that
endeavor,
it
would
limit
the
costs
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
which,
after
all,
result
in
the
exclusion
of
reliable
probative
evidence
of
guilt
in
every
case
where
it's
applied.
and
the
court
could
tailor
the
exclusionary
rule
in
that
manner.
if
it
did
so,
it
would
certainly
minimize
the
costs,
and
it
would
represent
the
least
amount
of
intrusion
on
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
but
i
would
caution
the
court
in
this
respect.
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
another
purpose
for
the
exclusionary
rule,
namely
creating
incentives
for
counsel
to
challenge
existing
precedent,
that
will
represent
a
substantial
departure
from
this
court's
consistent
holdings
that
the
only
function
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
police
misconduct,
and
once
the
court
has
acknowledged
that
an
additional
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
is
justified,
even
if
in
these
rare
situations,
it
will
create
pressure
for
litigants
to
urge
that
additional
policy
interests
of
the
administration
of
justice
would
be
served
if
the
court
would
create
yet
another
exception.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
the
strongest
argument
against--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
proposal,
justice
scalia,
would
be
an
appearance
of
arbitrariness
in
the
court's
actions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
it
hasn't
caused
havoc,
for
several
reasons.
one
is
it's
extraordinarily
rare
for
this
court
to
overrule
its
own
fourth
amendment
precedent.
it's
apparently
equally
rare,
or
almost
equally
rare,
for
the
courts
of
appeals
to
overrule
their
precedent
and
adopt
a
more
defendant-friendly
fourth
amendment
rule.
i
cannot
claim
to
have
done
an
exhaustive
survey
of
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
decisions
that
possibly
overruled
fourth
amendment
holdings,
but
the
results
of
my
research
disclose
only
one
case
in
which
a
court
of
appeals
overruled
its
precedent
to
favor
a
defendant,
and
that
occurred
in
1987
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
fifth
circuit
adopted
a
good
faith
exception
precisely
like
the
one
that
the
government
is
urging
the
court
to
adopt
today
and
declined
to
suppress
the
evidence
for
that
reason.
no
other
circuit
has
apparently
confronted
the
question
of
whether
overruling
a
decision
triggers
the
good
faith
exception.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
that
is
the
retroactivity
question,
and
the
retroactivity
question
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
court
has
acknowledged
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
an
individual
right,
it's
a
remedy.
it
doesn't
involve
any
violation
of
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendant.
it's
a
remedy
that
this
court
devised
after
finding
a
fourth
amendment.
and
i
think,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
in
judge
kravitch's
opinion
for
the
eleventh
circuit,
judge
kravitch
acknowledged
that
gant
is
the
law;
the
search
in
that
case
was
unconstitutional.
the
next
question
is
an
entirely
separate
issue
of
remedy,
and
that
remedy
issue
is
governed
by
this
court's
good
faith
precedents.
the
rarity
with
which
courts
of
appeals
have
confronted
this
simply
reflects
the
fact
that,
even
without
the
lack
of
incentive
that
petitioner
says
will
result
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
government
today,
holdings
that
overrule
fourth
amendment
decisions
squarely
and
favor
defendants
do
not
occur
all
that
often.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
ginsburg,
before
the
litigation
that
occurred
in
the
wake
of
gant,
there
was
only
one
precedent
on
the
books
in
any
circuit
that
i'm
aware
of
that
had
applied
the
--
in
the
federal
system
--
that
had
applied
a
good
faith
rule
to
overrule
judicial
decisions.
that
was
united
states
v.
jackson
in
the
fifth
circuit.
it's
cited
in
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
in
this
case.
it
happened
in
1987.
so
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
prosecutors
and
government
officials
were
not
raising
good
faith
exclusionary
rule
arguments
in
the
cases
that
were
held
for
gant.
i
don't
believe
that
the
united
states
had
done
so,
and
as
a
result,
it
was
perfectly
logical
and
in
accordance
with
this
court's
normal
practice
to
grant,
vacate,
and
remand
those
cases
for
further
consideration
under
gant.
but
in
the
wake
of
gant,
courts
began
to
think
of
the
logic
of
leon
and
krull
and
this
court's
recent
decision
in
herring
v.
united
states
and
attempt
to
apply
the
logic
of
those
decisions
to
a
circumstance
in
which
a
police
officer
relies
on
a
binding
and
governing
appellate
precedent,
and
they
concluded
that
courts
that
announce
precedents
have
every
reason
to
expect
that
litigants
will
rely
on
them
and
that
police
officers
will
rely
on
them.
therefore,
there
is
no
deterrent
purpose
to
be
served
by
suppressing
the
evidence.
it's
all
cost.
and
the
cost
would
be
that
individuals
whose
convictions
have
been
obtained
based
on
evidence
that
was
seized
in
reasonable
good
faith
reliance
on
existing
appellate
precedent
will
now
be
able
to
overturn
their
convictions,
and
that's
a
heavy
cost
to
the
administration
of
justice.
it's
why
the
exclusionary
rule
has
been
confined
to
particularized
circumstances
where
it's
thought
that
it
will
actually
achieve
a
benefit,
and
it
has
not
been
expanded
beyond
those
purposes.
so
given
that
litigants,
criminal
defendants,
have
a
tremendous
incentive
to
challenge
their
convictions
and
to
try
to
navigate
around
precedents
while
simultaneously
showing
that
those
precedents
may
have
underlying
material
flaws,
this
court
is
highly
unlikely
to
be
deprived
of
cases
in
which
litigants
attempt
to
undermine
precedents
without
actually
calling
for
their
overruling.
that
is
what
happened,
for
example,
in
batson
v.
kentucky,
where
the
petitioner
in
that
case
did
not
want
to
head-on
confront
swain
v.
alabama
and
ask
for
its
overruling,
and
as
a
result
asserted
that
racially
discriminatory
peremptory
challenges
were
invalid
under
the
sixth
amendment,
rather
than
the
equal
protection
clause.
this
court
got
the
case
and
concluded
that
the
proper
analysis
was
the
equal
protection
clause
and
it
accordingly
overruled
swain
in
relevant
part.
so
it's
highly
unlikely
that
if,
in
fact,
a
precedent
of
this
court
is
beginning
to
fray
around
the
edges
and
justices
of
this
court
have
written
concurrences
or
dissents
that
explain
that
they
no
longer
believe
that
the
logic
of
that
is
sound,
litigants
will
exploit
those
statements
in
an
effort
to
narrow
the
precedent
and
ultimately
expose
its
flaws,
so
that
if
this
court
determines
it
can
overrule
the
precedent,
and
it
can
do
so
even
if
the
exclusionary
remedy
will
not
follow.
mr.

this
case,
justice
alito,
only
involves
the
example
of
binding
appellate
precedent,
and
judge
kravitch's
opinion
for
the
eleventh
circuit
distinguished
between
the
two
situations.
in
the
situation
in
which
there
is
no
precedent,
such
that
an
officer
would
not
be
instructed
that
his
conduct
is
affirmatively
unconstitutional,
qualified
immunity
applies,
and
there
would
be
arguments
that
there
is
nothing
to
deter
if
an
officer
acts
within
that
empty
space.
but
there
is
a
countervailing
argument,
and
the
countervailing
argument,
which
judge
kravitch
talked
about
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
opinion,
would
be
that
when
there's
no
law
on
the
books
courts
should
give
officers
to
--
an
incentive
to
act
in
favor
of
the
more
constitutionally
protective
manner,
rather
than
taking
a
flier
on
what
might
turn
out
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
not
submit
to
the
court
that
the
united
states
necessarily
agrees
with
that.
i
think
that
this
case
doesn't
involve
that
problem
and,
as
i
said,
there
are
contrary
arguments
that
could
be
advanced
based
on
this
court's
description
in
herring
of
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
reach
conduct
that
is
either
reckless
or
intentional
or
at
the
least
systematically
negligent.
and,
so,
some
day
this
court
may
have
to
confront
whether
the
narrow
limitation
that
judge
kravitch
adapted
--
adopted
in
her
opinion
is
the
correct
rule
of
law
versus
a
broader
view
that
exclusion
is
only
appropriate
when
the
officers
have
engaged
in
truly
culpable
conduct.
but
that's
not
a
bridge
that
the
court
needs
to
cross
in
this
case.
it's
not
an
argument
that
the
united
states
is
advancing
for
affirmance
of
the
judgment.
this
judgment
can
be
affirmed
simply
by
holding
that
the
syllogism
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
that,
absent
a
deterrent
purpose
there
is
no
basis
for
exclusion,
there
is
no
deterrent
purpose
here,
that's
sufficient
to
resolve
this
case
and
the
court
can
leave
for
another
day,
if
it
agrees
with
that
proposition,
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
should
have
any
broader
exception
for
good
faith
behavior.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
