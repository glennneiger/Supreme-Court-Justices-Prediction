justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
--
is
there
anything
to
be
said
for
simplicity?
the
normal
rule
is
when
the
police
violate
the
fourth
amendment
you
exclude
the
evidence.
that's
the
rule.
then
there
are
some
exceptions,
good
faith,
et
cetera.
but
that's
the
normal
rule.
you
have
a
new
law
in
this
court.
the
new
law
says,
now
this
is
a
violation;
we
didn't
previously
think
it
is,
but
it
is;
and
that
applies
to
the
case
in
front
us
and
to
other
cases
on
direct
appeal.
the
reason
that's
simple
is
that's
what
we've
always
done.
and
somebody
says
let's
make
an
exception
here,
bring
in
the
exception,
good
faith,
and
we
say
no.
why?
not
because
any
of
the
policy
arguments
are
wrong,
but
just
because,
as
this
last
40
minutes
demonstrates,
once
we
do
that
it's
so
complicated,
only
14
people
are
going
to
understand
it
and
they're
not
going
to
understand
it,
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
very
optimistic.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
why,
isn't
it
--
that's
why
the
normal
rule
has
been
that
the
person
litigating
the
case
gets
the
advantage
of
the
new
rule,
as
do
other
people
whose
initial
appeals
are
not
final,
and
there
we
are.
that's
a
rule
existing,
i
guess,
for
a
long
time.
i
guess
these
other
people
have
to
have
raised
the
question
in
their
case.
they
have
to
have
asked
for
it.
they
can't
--
they
have
to
follow
normal
rules.
has
that
caused
havoc,
or
has
that
caused
things
--
the
legal
system,
even
before--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
would
have
thought
it
was
more
for
this
court,
actually,
anyway.
i
don't
know
if
it
has
to
be
the
words
"overruling".
my
recollection
was:
has
the
court
created
a
new
rule
of
law?
i
think
it
goes
back
to
cardozo,
sunburst
or
something,
that
if
the
court
creates
a
new
rule
of
law,
then
does
it
apply
prospective,
retroactively?
and
the
worked-out
position
was
it
applies
retroactively,
but
to
the
litigant
and
to
those
whose
appeals
are
not
final
if
they
raised
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
want
to
change
that,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
hiving
off
the
--
the
suppression.
i
understand.
