justice
elena
kagan
mr.
kerr,
let's
say
i'm
concerned
about
the
kinds
of
issues
that
you're
raise,
the
incentives
on
defense
counsel
and
also
the
oddity
of
the
court
deciding
a
case
in
which
it's
absolutely
not
possible
to
grant
a
remedy.
wouldn't
the
solution
to
that
be
not
the
rule
that
you
are
advocating,
but
instead
a
much
more
limited
rule
which
said
that
in
that
case
the
exclusionary
rule
applied,
but
not
in
any
other
case,
not
in
any
case
on
direct
appeal?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess,
mr.
kerr,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
right.
justice
harlan
was
talking
about
constitutional
rights
at
a
period
where,
as
the
chief
justice
said,
the
exclusionary
rule
was
viewed
as
part
of
the
constitutional
right.
but
if
this
court
doesn't
view
the
exclusionary
rule
that
way
any
more,
if
it
views
the
exclusionary
rule
as
simply
a
prophylactic
rule
which
gives
a
particular
defendant
a
windfall
in
order
to
gain
systemic
effects,
systemic
benefits,
why
would
we
do
it
any
more
broadly
than
we
would
need
to
do
it?
and
we
would
just
say:
look,
we
understand
your
point
that
this
would
very
much
change
the
incentives
for
defense
counsel.
we
understand
your
point
that
it's
kind
of,
i
don't
know,
maybe
inconsistent
with
article
iii
to
take
a
case
in
which
there
was
absolutely
no
chance
of
relief
being
granted,
but
we
can
deal
with
those
issues
simply
by
saying
that
in
your
case
you
get
relief,
but
not
in
any
other.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
dreeben,
do
you
think
that
if
a
lawyer
did
that,
if
a
lawyer
filed
a
cert
petition
and
said
you
should
overturn
the
following
fourth
amendment
precedent,
and
that
was
all
that
was
in
the
cert
petition,
would
we
be
able
to
grant
that
cert
petition
knowing
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
relief
for
that
petitioner?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
think
that
we
would
have
appropriate
article
iii
authority
to
decide
that
question
without
any
hope
of
relief?
