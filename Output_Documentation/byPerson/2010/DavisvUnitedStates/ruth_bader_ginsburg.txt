mr.
kerr,
the
line
that
has
been
suggested
by
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy,
that
is
exactly
the
line
that
the
eleventh
circuit
took;
is
it
not
the
case?
i
mean,
judge
kravitch
said:
yes,
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated,
so
to
that
extent
we're
following
retroactivity
precedent.
but
the
remedy
is
something
different.
that
was
exactly
the
line
that
she
took,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
on
your
theory,
i
mean,
there's
another
question
in
this
case;
that
is,
perhaps
this
evidence
would
come
in
under
the
inventory,
as
a
--
as
a
legitimate
inventory
search,
and
if
the
court
decided
that
question,
then
--
then
the
question
you're
arguing,
the
exclusionary
rule
question,
would
have
no
practical
consequences.
on
your
theory,
the
way
you
reasoned,
shouldn't
the
court
first
decide
was
this
a
legitimate
inventory
search,
and
if
so,
then
we
never
get
to
any
exclusionary
rule
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
essentially,
is
your
argument
essentially
that
we
should
distinguish
never,
which
would
be
this
case
if
your
position
is
not
right,
and
hardly
ever.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
what
about
gant
itself?
gant
severely
qualified
belton.
should
there
have
been
a
suppression
remedy
for
gant,
as
justice
kagan
suggested,
the
very
case
that
changes
the
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
would
you
answer
it?
was
gant
purely
prospective
or
did
gant
itself
get
the
exclusionary
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
--
suppose
it
had
been
raised?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
think
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--were
we
right
that
--
there
were
several
cases
that
were
tbr'd
in
light
of
gant.
maybe
some
of
them
shouldn't
have
been
tbr'd
under
your
theory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she
did
say
that
if
there
is
ambiguity,
then
the
police
must
err
on
the
side
of
not
searching.
do
you
think
that
that's
--
do
you
accept
that?
