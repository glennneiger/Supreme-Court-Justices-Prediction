justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
lose
me
in
the
argument
because
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
we
--
if
we
did
apply
the
good
faith
rule,
we
would
be
denying
retroactive
effect
to
the
altered
judgment.
it
continues
to
apply
to
matters
beforehand,
but
it's
a
totally
different
question
whether,
assuming
it
is
retroactive,
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
applies.
it's
a
--
it's
a
separate
question
from
retroactivity,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
label
at
all.
you're
--
we're
not
denying
the
application
of
the
altered
rule
to
your
client's
conduct.
it
applies.
but
the
question
of
whether,
when
it
does
apply,
the
good
faith
disregard
of
it
by
a
police
officer
nonetheless
allows
the
evidence
to
be
admitted,
it's
a
totally
different
--
we're
giving
full
retroactive
effect
to
the
--
to
the
change
in
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kerr,
i've
been
on
the
bench
30
years
or
so
now.
i
have
never,
never
heard
counsel
come
before
the
court
and
say
that
we
should
overrule
a
case
without
making
the
argument:
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
within
the
prior
decision
anyway.
it
just
doesn't
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
still
not
the
argument
you
should
overrule
the
prior
case,
period,
with
no
effort
to
show
why
you
could
come
out
that
way
without
overruling
the
prior
cases.
i
just
don't
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
saying
they're
nonexistent.
i'm
not
saying
they're
rare.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
if
petitioner
says
we
should
be
able
to
overrule
our
prior
substantive
precedent,
he
should
also
logically
say
that
we
should
be
able
to
overrule
our
prior
precedent
regarding
the
exclusionary
rule.
so
that
whenever
somebody
wants
to
come
up
here
to
challenge
prior
precedent,
he
can
just
say:
you
know,
your
honors,
we're
asking
you
to
overrule
two
cases:
the
first
one,
the
substantive
rule
of
fourth
amendment
law;
and
secondly,
whether
that
--
that
change
in
law
can
govern
the
action
of
the
policeman
who
didn't
realize
that
the
law
was
going
to
be
changed.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
he
asks
for
the
double
overruling
that
i
just
suggested,
i
guess
there's
some
chance
that
the
court
would
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
so
complicated,
counsel.
don't
worry
about
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
actually,
why
don't
we
just
abolish
the
exclusionary
rule?
that
would
be
really
simple.
whatever
evidence
tends
to
prove
the
truth
comes
in.
that
would
be
a
very
simple
system
if
we're
looking
for
just
simplicity,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
proposing
that,
though?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
an
officer
when
he
goes
out
to
do
his
job
does
not
have
primarily
in
mind
not
to
get
sued,
but
i
think
primarily
in
mind
he
wants
to
arrest
somebody
in
such
a
manner
that
the
person
can
be
convicted
of
the
crime
that
he's
done,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
we'd
look
particularly
good,
either,
do
you?
i
mean,
if.
we
had
one
case
raising
a
fourth
amendment
question,
and
let's
say
six
others
who
raise
--
that
raise
the
same
question,
what
would
we
do?
we
would
grant
the
first
and
hold
the
second?
no
use
to
hold
the
second,
because
they're
going
to
lose
anyway,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
guess
we
would
--
we
would
just
grant
the
first
and
deny
all
the
rest,
even
though
they're
raising
the
same
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
smell
very
good.
