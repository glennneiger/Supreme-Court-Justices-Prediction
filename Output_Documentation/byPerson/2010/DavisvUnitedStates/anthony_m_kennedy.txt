yes,
but
just
to
pursue
justice
scalia's
point:
the
good
faith
rule
is
itself
a
rule
that's
intact,
that's
a
precedent,
that
was
on
the
books,
and
the
good
faith
rule
qualifies
the
exclusionary
rule.
so
why
aren't
we
just
following
the
good
faith
rule
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
there's
nothing
retroactive
or
prospective
about
it.
it's
just
--
it's
just
applying
the
existing
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
an
application
of
--
that's
a
subset,
it's
one
application,
of
the
good
faith
rule,
which
is
an
overall
principle.
but
we're
being
faithful,
under
the
government's
view,
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
overall
principle.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
might
respond
that
the
government's
going
to
say,
well,
there's
monell
that's
in
their
brief,
and
you'll
probably
say
that
that's
a
weak
substitute
for
a
criminal
defense
attorney's
doing
it
in
the
trial
itself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
were
concerned
with
the
costs
of
your
rule
in
the
sense
that
gant
does
have
some
exception
for
the
safety
of
the
officers,
and
i
think
you
can
read
the
case
if
there's
some
general
safety
considerations
for
not
securing
the
car
in
a
neighborhood
rather
than
leave
it
by
itself.
if
we
adopted
your
rule,
the
prosecution
in
all
those
cases
would
not
have
had
the
opportunity
to
make
those
additional
defenses
or
those
--
to
advance
those
additional
justifications
for
the
search.
maybe
you'll
say,
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
resurrect
linkletter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
those
cases
were
pending.
i
was
concerned
with
cases
that
were
closed,
i
suppose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is
something
ironic
in
your
position
that
the
defendant
who
lives
in
the
circuit
that
is
most
clearly
wrong
is
treated
worst.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
--
in
--
in
one
--
in
one
sense
if
we're
talking
about
costs,
the
rule
the
government
proposes
is
--
is
defendant
friendly,
in
that
this
court
may
be
more
willing
to
impose
stricter
rules
under
the
fourth
amendment,
if
it
knows
that
the
good
faith
rule
will
protect
against
the
--
the
costs
of
--
of
overturning
the
conviction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
could
work
to
the
benefit
of
defendants
as
a
class,
not
the
particular
defendant?
