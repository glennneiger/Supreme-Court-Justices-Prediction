mr.
orin
s.
kerr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
the
intersection
of
two
similar
doctrines
of
the
same
vintage
that
point
in
exactly
opposite
directions:
the
first,
retroactivity;
and
the
second,
the
good
faith
exception.
this
court
should
reverse
and
hold
that
the
good
faith
exception
does
not
apply
to
reliance
on
precedent,
and
instead,
that
should
be
governed
by
the
retroactivity
principles
of
griffith
v.
kentucky.
i
think
it's
helpful
to
start
with
linkletter
v.
walker,
the
1965
decision
that
introduced
the
concept
of
retroactivity.
linkletter
held
that
mapp
v.
ohio,
which
had
held
that
the
exclusionary
rule
applied
to
state
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment,
is
not
retroactive.
the
linkletter
decision
was
premised
on
a
simple
syllogism:
the
exclusionary
rule
is
about
deterrence;
a
decision
that
postdates
a
search
cannot
deter
the
police;
and
therefore,
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
available
in
cases
before
mapp.
linkletter's
syllogism
is
the
same
syllogism
that
the
court
is
attempting
--
that,
sorry,
the
government
is
attempting
to
rely
on
in
this
case.
history
has
shown
that
that
syllogism
is
powerful
in
the
context
of
collateral
review
and
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
but
it
should
not
apply
on
direct
review.
it
should
not
apply
on
direct
review
for
two
basic
reasons.
first,
because
on
direct
review
the
first
case
must
be
treated
like
other
cases
on
direct
review,
the
exclusionary
rule
must
be
available
in
order
to
protect
the
adversary
process
and
avoid
advisory
opinions,
which--
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
--i
disagree,
justice
scalia.
during
the
linkletter
period,
the
scope
of
the
exclusionary
rule
for
the
fourth
amendment
was
an
essential
concern
in
a
series
of
retroactivity
cases,
linkletter
being
the
first,
desist
v.
united
states
being
the
second.
there
were
--
many
of
the
linkletter
era
retroactivity
cases
were
concerned
with
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
the--
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
--i
disagree,
justice
kennedy.
it's
not
applying
existing
law,
because
the
effect
of
what
is
labeled
the
good
faith
exception
in
this
setting
is
actually
to
apply
the
prior
decision;
that
is,
to
have
all
of
the
substance
and
effect
of
a
retroactivity
decision.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
i
think
the
court
needs
to
take
away
the
labels
here.
the
government
is
using
a
label
of
good
faith
for
what
is
essentially
a
retroactivity
argument.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
at
the
same
time,
justice
scalia,
whatever
rule
is
applied
in
this
case
would
have
to
be
the
same
rule
that
applies
in
gant
itself,
and
without
the
incentive
of
counsel
to
argue
in
favor
of
the
change
in
the
law,
that
would
block
claims
by
defense
attorneys
to
overturn
the
precedents
of
this
court.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
leon,
i
think,
raised
a
different
setting.
it
raised
the
question
of
reliance
on
errors
by
a
magistrate
judge,
which
simply
does
not
implicate
the
concerns
of
retroactivity,
which
is
this
court
changing
its
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
that
raises
a
distinct
set
of
principles,
as
justice
harlan
recognized
in
his
dissent
in
desist
and
his
separate
opinion--
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
--yes.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
because
it
takes
two
branches
of
government
for
the
exclusionary
rule
to
deter
constitutional
violations.
the
court
has
to
properly
construe
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
police
need
to
then
properly
follow
the
court's
precedents.
the
court
can't
turn
away
from
the
role
of
this
court's
precedents
in
the
enforcement
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
justice
alito,
i
think
it
depends
on
what
the
good
faith
exception
is.
the
government's
brief
i
think
does
not
exactly
articulate
what
the
standard
is
that
--
to
which
it
would
like
to
apply.
even
so,
most
circuit
court
decisions
interpreting
the
fourth
amendment
are
derivative
of
this
court's
decisions
interpreting
the
fourth
amendment.
and
this
case
is
a
good
example.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
quite
similar
to
the
facts
of
belton.
the
eleventh
circuit
had
not
actually
expanded
upon
belton;
it
had
merely
had
relatively
routine
applications
of
belton.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
at
the
same
time,
the
eleventh
circuit's
development
of
the
law
was
--
went
no
further
than
belton
itself,
and
this
court
needs
adversaries
to
make
forthright
arguments
to
this
court
which
may
involve
distinguishing
precedent
and
may
involve
overturning
precedent.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
if
this
court
adopts
a
good
faith
exception
that
is
quite
narrow
and
would
not
allow
an
officer
in
one
circuit
to
reasonably
rely
on
the
clear
circuit
court
decisions
of
another
circuit,
that's
certainly
a
possibility.
however,
it's
not
clear
as
to
why
the
court
would
adopt
such
a
narrow
version
of
the
exception.
the
language
that
the
government
proposes,
at
least,
seems
to
be
the
language
of
qualified
immunity;
the
notion
of
reasonable
reliance
on
a
decision
being
believed
to
be
lawful.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
that's
correct.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
that
issue,
of
course,
has
not
been
briefed
in
this
case.
it
would
remain
for
the
eleventh
circuit
to
apply
that
in
the
event
the
court
reverses.
at
the
same
time,
i
wish
to
be
clear
that
i'm
not
arguing
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
available
in
every
case
when
the
court
overturns
its
precedent,
merely
that
it
is
a
remedy
in
some
cases,
and
i
think
it's
actually
a
necessary
cost.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
i
agree
that's
never
been
the
court's
law,
and
i
think
there's
an
important
distinction
to
be
made
here.
the
distinction
is
between
an
argument
that
has
a
remote
chance
of
success,
and
defendants
will
make
those
claims,
and
arguments
that
have
no
chance
of
success,
which
is
no--
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
--but
there's
a
big
difference
between
a
tough
case
and
no
case.
the
difficulty
of
the
government's
claim
is
the
defendant
would
know
any
effort
to
challenge
this
court's
precedent
cannot
logically
lead
to
any
relief.
either
the
defendant
will
lose
on
the
merits,
if
the
court
upholds
its
precedent
or
the
defendant
will
lose
under
the
good
faith
exception.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
hopeless
meaning
a
zero
percent
chance
of
likelihood.
that's
the
difficulty
of
the
government's
position,
is
that
it--
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
--i
think
justice
harlan's
answer
to
that
is
persuasive,
that
it's
inconsistent
with
basic
norms
of
constitutional
adjudication
to
treat
the
first
case
differently
from
other
cases
not
on
--
other
cases
on
direct
review.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
justice
kagan,
that
was
the
precise
premise
of
the
linkletter
regime.
the
idea
of
the
exclusionary
rule
as
a
judge-created
remedy,
the
idea
of
the
exclusionary
rule
as
not
being
a
personal
right,
that
actually
was
the
premise
of
linkletter.
so
to
go
back
to
something
that
resembles
that
regime
in
substance,
even
if
with
a
new
label.
i
think
is
ill-advised
in
light
of
the
history
of
the
linkletter
era,
and
the
court's
struggles
to
try
to
articulate
a
consistent
standard
that
can
treat
the
first
case
and
other
cases
similarly.
i
think
desist
was
a
fourth
amendment
case,
peltier
also
a
fourth
amendment
case.
the
government's
proposal
is
essentially
a
return
to
peltier
with
a
difference.
if
the
court
wants
to
treat
the
first
case
differently
than
later
cases,
it
is
essentially
recreating
peltier.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
i
think
there
are
two
differences.
one
is
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
from
the
standpoint
of
a
defendant
or
defense
attorney
between
a
remote
chance
of
success
in
a
legal
claim
and
no
chance
of
success
on
a
legal
claim.
krull
leaves
open
the
possibility
--
and
it
may
be
remote,
but
nonetheless
a
possibility
--
of
relief
if
the
defendant
can
persuade
a
court
that
a
reasonable
officer
would
have
known
in
light
of
this
court's
precedent
that
the
statute
allowed
unconstitutional
searches.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
and
yet
i
think
your
--
your
hypothetical,
your
suggestion
that
perhaps
the
court
could
adopt
that
standard,
shows
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
craft
a
good
faith
exception
that
ends
up
running
up
against
the
linkletter
problem.
this
is
exactly
the
issue
the
court
struggled
with
during
the
linkletter
era
that
justice
harlan--
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
--that's
correct.
where
the
rule
is
never,
defendants
are
unlikely
to
make
any
sort
of
claim,
and
this
court
would
be
denied
the
opportunity
to
review
its
own
precedents,
and
that's
an
essential
role
of
this
court's
decisions
in
the
fourth
amendment
setting.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
it
is
a
weak
substitute.
there's
been
no
case
that
i'm
aware
of
at
least
involving
liability
against
a
municipality
seeking
law
reform.
it's
because
the
court
has
rejected
the
notion
of
municipal
liability
as
being
based
on
respondeat
superior.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
i
disagree.
just
to
explain,
justice
kennedy,
my
rule
would
be
to
retain
the
existing
practice
of
this
court.
i'm
suggesting
no
changes
in
the
practice
of
this
court,
and
that
is
when
the
court
recognized
the
need
to
overturn
belton
or
at
least
to
substantially
change
belton
in
the
gant
case,
the
court,
justice
alito
in
his
dissent,
recognized
that
there
were
costs
along
with
that
and
that
led
to
review
of
cases
in
the
lower
courts.
in
many
of
those
lower
court
decisions,
the
lower
courts
held
that
the
searches
were
nonetheless
constitutional
under
gant,
and
that
was
absolutely
proper.
in
those
situations
there
is
no
constitutional
violation,
no
one
goes--
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
--in
the
closed
cases,
i'm
not
in
any
way
challenging
the
traditional
rule
of
teague
v.
layne
and
stone
v.
powell
that
the
new
rule
is
not
available.
as
soon
as
the
conviction
is
final,
the
door
is
closed
and
no
defendant
can
seek
review.
this
is
only
about
direct
review
and
the
initial
case
in
which
the
rule
is
announced,
and
that's
why
i
think
it
raises
a
special
set
of
jurisprudential
problems
because
it
implicates
this
court's
need
to
avoid
advisory
opinions
and
to
avoid
what
would
amount
to
a
one-way
street.
under
the
government's
proposed
rules,
proposed
rule,
defendants
would
have
a
limited
ability
to
challenge
precedents
that
construe
the
fourth
amendment
too
narrowly,
but
of
course
of
government
would
be
free
in
any
case
to
challenge
precedents
that
the
government
believes
construes
the
fourth
amendment
too
broadly.
the
concern
is
that
over
time
that
would
lead
to
an
asymmetry
in
the
court's
outcomes,
not
as
a
result
of
the
measured
judgments
of
this
court,
but
rather
as
a
result
of
the
incentives
on
counsel,
and
the
court
should
strive
to
avoid
that
sort
of
result.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
just
to
be
clear,
the
court
has
not
applied
the
good
faith
exception
in
this
setting.
the
government
is
arguing
for
an
expansion
of
the
good
faith
exception
into
territory
which
has
traditionally
been
thought
to
be
the
regime
of
retroactivity.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
i
don't
foresee
litigation
on
that
point
because,
at
least
as
i
understand
the
government's
rule,
as
soon
as
a
defendant
utters
the
phrase
"this
court
should
overturn
its
precedent.
"
then
the
good
faith
exception
would
automatically
apply.
that's
at
least
how
i
understand
the
government's
proposed
rule.
so
it
would
be
up
to
this
court
to
craft
exactly
what
the
standard
would
be,
but
if
the
standard
is
broad
enough
such
that
upon
asking
for--
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
--in
that
circumstance
i
think
the
court
would
be
forced
with
issuing
what
--
forced
to
issue
what
may
amount
to
an
advisory
opinion.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
i
think
the
incentive
on
defense
counsel,
if
the
government's
rule
is
adopted,
is
to
never
argue
that
cases
should
be
overturned,
and
instead
make
not
terribly
candid
arguments
to
this
court
that
every
case
is
distinguishable.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
katz
v.
united
states
is
perhaps
a
case
worth
focusing
on,
where
the
court
overturned
the
rule
of
goldman
and
olmstead
that
wiretapping
does
not
implicate
the
fourth
amendment.
katz's
brief
to
this
court
argued
that
the
goldman-olmstead
regime
had
--
was
no
longer
applicable,
had
been
implicitly
overturned
by
prior
cases,
and
then
said
if
it
has
not
been
implicitly
overturned,
it
must
be
overruled.
there
was
no
attempt
to
try
to
distinguish
the
facts
of
the
katz
case
from
the
goldman-olmstead
regime.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
those
arguments,
i
agree,
justice
scalia,
are
rare.
at
the
same
time
they
are
important
arguments.
it
is
an
--
it
is
an
alternative
argument--
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
--nonetheless,
the
incentive
on
counsel
under
the
government's
rule
would
be
not
to
ever
make
the
claim
that
a
precedent
should
be
overturned.
and
the
court
needs
that
argument
to
be
made
in
appropriate
cases
so
the
court
can
enter
decisions
and
consider
the
balance
of
the
considerations
appropriately.
it
has
done
so
under
the
current
practice,
and
that
is
really
as
a
result
of
griffith
v.
kentucky,
which
applies
not
only
--
allows
the
exclusionary
rule
to
be
available
in
the
first
case,
but
in
other
cases
on
direct
review.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
costs
--
or
return
to
the
costs
here
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
first,
the
plain
error
doctrine
is
going
to
largely
address
the
concerns
that
the
government
has
in
this
case.
if
this
court
is
seeking
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
exclusionary
rule
when
the
court
overturns
precedents
under
the
plain
error
doctrine,
if
defendants
don't
raise
a
challenge
to
the
search
or
seizure
in
their
case
there
will
be
no
relief
available
to
them.
so
therefore,
the
only
possible
relief
that
could
be
granted
is
for
individuals
that
saw
the
issue,
raised
the
issue,
and
that
will,
of
course,
include
the
individual
who
raises
the
claim
in
a
case
where
the
court
overturns
its
precedent,
therefore
avoiding
any
of
the
difficulties
similar
to
that
of
retroactivity.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
that's
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy.
and,
in
fact,
that
exact
argument
was
one
of
the
reasons
justice
harlan
concluded
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
available
in
the
first
case
and
on
direct
review.
the
court
needs
to
be
aware
of
the
costs
when
it
overturns
precedent.
it
should
not
depart
from
precedent
lightly.
and
i
think
gant
is
a
good
example.
justice
alito's
dissent
nicely
points
out
the
very
real
costs
of
the
shift
from
the
belton
rule
to
the
gant
rule,
and
if
there
were
no
costs
in
a
regime
of
pure
prospectivity,
the
court
would
feel
much
more
free
to
overturn
its
precedents
because
no
one
would
actually
be
affected
by
the
rule
of
any
cases
that
are
either
on
direct
review
or
in
the
initial
case
or
of
those
individuals
whose
convictions
are
already
final.
mr.
orin
s.
kerr
that
works
to
the
benefit
of
defendants
as
a
class,
absolutely.
in
fact,
going
back
to
the
linkletter
era,
that
was
one
of
the
--
perceived
as
one
of
the
benefits
of
linkletter,
that
it
freed
the
court
to
overturn
precedent.
but
i
think
that
is
an
improper
consideration.
it
is
necessary
for
fourth
amendment
decisionmaking
for
the
court
to
accurately
weigh
the
costs
and
benefits
of
any
shift
in
the
rules.
and
so
i
think
that
the
costs
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
that
setting
are
actually
necessary
costs.
and
i
also
think
concerns
of
a
windfall
that
are
available
to
defendants
are
overstated
because
of
the
many
doctrines
that
limit
the
scope
of
the
exclusionary
rule
such
as
inevitable
discovery
or
standing.
actually
the
only
individuals
who
would
receive
the
benefit
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
those
individuals
who
were
not
searched
in
the
first
place
if
the
constitution
were
followed.
so,
those
are
individuals
who
actually
did
not
receive
--
will
not
receive
a
windfall.
they
will
essentially,
if
they
were
lucky
enough
to
raise
the
issue,
go
back
to
the
state
that
they
were
before
the
constitution
was
violated.
and
again,
that's
a
limited
group
of
people,
and
those
are,
i
think,
the
necessary
costs
required
by
the
basic
norms
of
constitutional
adjudication
that
justice
harlan
raised
in
his
dissent
in
desist
v.
united
states,
and
i
think
in
a
lot
of
ways
this
case
does
return
to
those
concerns
of
justice
harlan,
raised
both
in
his
desist
dissent
and
his
separate
opinion
for
the
court
in
mackey
v.
united
states.
i
also
wanted
to
focus
on
how
similar
the
issue
is
in
this
case
to
--
in
the
linkletter
era,
if
you
read
the
desist
dissent,
in
particular
justice
harlan's
dissent,
it's
clear
that
he's
considering
the
issue
of
retroactivity
to
be
about
the
scope
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
eleventh
circuit
below
had
this
idea
that
retroactivity
is
about
the
availability
of
a
rule,
but
rules
are
not
sort
of
ephemeral
ideas
that
are
available
or
not
without
any
impact.
it
must
be
that
if
they
are
available,
they
are
available
independently
of
when
they
were
announced
and
should
be
enforced
accordingly.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
