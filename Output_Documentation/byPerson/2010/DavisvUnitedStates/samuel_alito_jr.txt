justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
understand
your
argument
with
respect
to
decisions
of
this
court,
and
i
think
that's
your
strongest
argument,
but
would
you
concede
that
that
argument
does
not
apply
when
the
precedent
on
which
the
police
are
relying
is
a
decision
of
one
of
the
courts
of
appeals
or
a
state
supreme
court
fourth
amendment
decision?
in
that
situation,
there
will
be
plenty
of
avenues
for
obtaining
review
of
the
correctness
of
those
decisions;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
it
applied
its
understanding
of
belton,
which
turned
out
to
be
different
from
the
understanding
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
gant
and
the
understanding
of
at
least
four
members
of
this
court
when
gant
got
here.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
i
could
just
come
back
to
my
question:
suppose
you
have
a
decision
in
one
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
says
certain
conduct
is
permitted
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
the
police
in
that
circuit,
federal
law
enforcement
officers
in
that
circuit,
follow
that
precedent.
now,
is
--
will
there
not
be
plenty
of
opportunities
to
review
the
correctness
of
that
decision
because
the
issue
may
arise
in
other
circuits
where
the
matter
isn't
settled?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
incentives
that
you're
talking
about,
is
there
really
much
difference
between
what
would
apply
in
a
case
like
this
and
what
already
applies
in
cases
that
fall
under
krull?
suppose
congress
enacts
a
statute
that
authorizes
a
search
under
particular
circumstances,
as
it
did,
as
was
the
case
in
almeida-sanchez.
now,
under
krull
nobody
is
going
to
be
able
to,
and
no
one
who
is
subjected
to
a
search
under
that
statute
is
going
to
be
able,
to
challenge,
to
obtain
suppression,
unless
you
can
say
that
a
reasonable
law
enforcement
officer
couldn't
have
thought
that
this
statute
which
was
enacted
by
congress
and
signed
by
the
president
was
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
maybe
there'll
be
a
few
cases
like
that,
but
in
the
great
majority,
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
the
person
will
not
be
able
to
mount
such
a
challenge.
so
what
is
the
difference
between
the
situation
here
and
the
situation
that
the
court
already
approved
in
krull?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
we
could
leave
that
open
here.
we
could
say
that
there's
no
good
faith
immunity
if
a
reasonable
officer
couldn't
have
believed
that
a
prior
decision
of
this
court
was
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
maybe
that
sounds
strange
only
because
we
have
a
higher
opinion
of
ourselves
than
we
do
of
the
congress
and
the
president.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
particularly
in
light
of
that,
what
is
wrong
with
the
suggestion
that
justice
kagan
raised
in
one
of
her
questions
about
retaining
an
exception
to
the
good
faith
exception
for
the
situation,
for
the
defendant
whose
case
comes
up
here
and
results
in
the
overruling
of
one
of
this
court's
precedents?
the
court
invented
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
court
invented
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
is
there
anything
to
prevent
the
court
from
inventing
a
new
exception
to
the
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
the
rule
that
you're
arguing
for
apply
only
in
the
situation
where
there
is
a
binding
precedent
that
affirmatively
approves
a
particular
police
practice,
or
would
it
also
apply
in
the
situation
in
which
there
is
simply
absolutely
nothing
on
the
books
that
prohibits
the
police
practice,
so
that
a
reasonable
officer
wouldn't
have
any
reason
to
think
that
the
practice
was
unconstitutional?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
is
a
case
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
in
the
course
of
a
routine
automobile
stop,
police
officers
lawfully
arrested
a
passenger
in
the
car,
petitioner
davis,
and
then
conducted
a
search
of
the
car.
the
police
found
a
gun
that
belongs
to
davis,
and
davis
was
indicted
and
later
convicted
in
federal
court
on
the
charge
of
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
convicted
felon.
at
the
time
of
the
search
in
this
case,
binding
eleventh
circuit
precedent
had
interpreted
one
of
this
court's
fourth
amendment
cases,
new
york
versus
belton
to
authorize
vehicle
searches
like
the
one
conducted
here,
a
vehicle
search
incident
to
a
recent
occupant's
arrest.
two
years
later,
while
davis'
appeal
in
this
case
was
still
pending,
this
court
rejected
the
eleventh
circuit's
interpretation
of
belton
in
a
case
called
arizona
versus
gant.
the
parties
agree
that
under
gant,
the
vehicle
search
in
this
case
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
the
question
before
us
in
this
case
is
whether
the
evidence
obtained
during
the
search,
the
gun,
should
be
suppressed
under
the
exclusionary
rule.
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
a
personal
constitutional
right
but
a
prudential
doctrine,
the
sole
purpose
of
which
is
to
deter
police
misconduct.
the
rule
applies
only
when
the
deterrent's
benefits
of
suppression
outweigh
its
costs.
thus,
this
court's
cases
upheld
that
when
the
police
conduct
a
search
in
objectively
reasonable
reliance
on
the
subsequently
invalidated
search
warrant
or
statute,
exclusion
of
evidence
is
unwarranted.
we
now
conclude
that
the
same
result
should
obtain
in
this
case.
when
the
police
conduct
a
search
in
objectively
reasonable
reliance
on
binding
judicial
precedent,
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
apply.
suppressing
evidence
in
such
cases
would
deter
no
police
misconduct
and
would
impose
substantial
costs.
in
cases
like
this
one
where
the
applicable
precedent
is
a
decision
of
a
court
of
appeals,
this
rule
will
not
prevent
the
development
of
fourth
amendment
case
law
since
challenges
may
be
brought
in
other
circuits.
we
do
not
reach
the
question
whether
a
particular
petitioner
who
obtains
the
overruling
of
one
of
this
court's
fourth
amendment
precedents
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
