chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-11328,
davis
v.
united
states.
mr.
kerr.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
mr.
kerr,
our
cases
have
talked
about
the
deterrence
impact
on
police
conduct.
it
seems
to
me
you're
trying
to
expand
that
notion
to
cover
incentives
for
defendants,
and
as
i
read
--
i
guess
it's
leon,
in
footnote
25,
it
says
the
argument
that
defendants
will
lose
their
incentive
to
litigate
meritorious
fourth
amendment
claims
as
a
result
of
a
good
faith
exception
is
--
is
unpersuasive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
our
--
our
theory
on
the
exclusionary
rule
across
the
board,
without
regard
to
the
underlying
substantive
violation,
is
that
you
look
to
deterrence
of
police
conduct.
and
here,
i
mean
--
i
mean,
you
agree
the
police
did
nothing
wrong
in
this
case,
don't
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
impact
--
why
do
we
want
to
deter
them
from
doing
what's
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
could
just
follow
up
on
justice
ginsburg's
question.
why
did
this
defendant
have
any
incentive
to
bring
his
constitutional
claim
if,
as
may
or
may
not
appear
too
likely,
the
inventory
search
is
going
to
result
in
the
admission
of
the
evidence
anyway?
it
seems
that
your
theory
goes
too
far
in
saying
that
defendants
will
never
have
an
incentive
to
bring
a
constitutional
challenge
if
there's
some
other
ground
on
which
the
evidence
might
be
admitted,
and
that's
never
been
our
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
often
--
we
do
that.
we
take
cases
where
you
can
bring
a
constitutional
challenge
or
a
different
challenge
all
the
time,
qualified
immunity
cases,
you
know,
what
was
the
law
and
was
it
clearly
established?
defendants
bring
the
qualified
immunity
cases
all
the
time
even
if
they
have
a
tough
case
on
whether
it's
clearly
established.
harmless
error
cases,
the
underlying
violation,
whether
it's
a
harmless
error,
and
the
court
can
decide
the
case
on
either
ground,
but
that
doesn't
keep
defendants
from
bringing
the
claims.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
incentive
argument
really
only
holds
up
when
the
ground
on
the
alternative
ground
is
hopeless?
otherwise
we'll
expect
the
defendants
to
bring
a
fourth
amendment
claim
because
it's
pretty
easy
to
bring.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
asking
us
for
an
exception
to
our
general
approach,
assuming
the
general
approach
is
not
the
one
you
succeed,
for,
as
you
put
it,
cases
where
there's
zero
possibility
of
success,
while
allowing
application
of
the
good
faith
precedent,
even
if
the
chances
of
success
are
remote.
is
it
really
worth
the
candle
to
have
litigation
over
whether
it
was
a
difference
between
zero
chance
and
remote
chance,
as
opposed
to
continuing
to
apply
the
good
faith
rule
across
the
board?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
your
position
on
that.
now,
getting
to
my
question,
is
it
really
worth
it
for
us
to
have
litigation
over
the
difference
between
zero
and
remote
in
determining
what
rule
we
should
apply
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
most
lawyers
don't
take
that
position.
most
lawyers
would
argue
the
court's
precedents
should
be
overturned
and,
if
not,
here's
why
our
case
is
different.
and
we
would
still
be
required
under
your
theory
to
look
if
that
second
argument
has
zero
chance
or
only
a
remote
chance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
seems
to
me
--
i
mean,
in
terms
of
the
incentives
on
the
defense
counsel,
it
would
be
an
odd
defense
lawyer
who
is
going
to
say
you
should
consider
argument
a
because
my
second
argument
has
got
zero
chance
of
succeeding.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
difference
between
zero
and
remote.

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
kerr,
you
have
6
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kerr.
the
case
is
submitted.
