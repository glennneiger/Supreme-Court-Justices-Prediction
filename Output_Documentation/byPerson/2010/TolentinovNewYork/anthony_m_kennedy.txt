this
--
this
goes
back
to
a
question
justice
alito
asked
in
a
probably
more
artful
way,
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
what's
supposed
to
happen
under
your
view
after
this
stop.
they
stop
the
person,
they
get
the
information
that
he's
driving
under
a
suspended
license,
and
are
they
supposed
to
say,
oh,
you
know,
we
shouldn't
have
stopped
you;
i'm
sorry,
have
a
nice
day,
go
ahead,
and
then
he
leaves?
is
that
what
goes
on?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
impounding
the
car
the
fruit
of
the
illegal
search?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
doesn't
the
public
safety
interest
then
permit
us
to
use
this
evidence
in
order
to
protect
the
public
safety
further
by
punishing
him
for
--
not
driving?
i
don't
see
the
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
wouldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
about
impounding
the
car?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
how
does
that
fit
with
your
earlier
answers
that
his
identity
here
could
be
suppressed?
and
then
i'll
ask
a
second
question.
if
you
say
that
you
can
suppress
his
identity
from
information
they
gained
after
the
stop
when
they
saw
him,
why
couldn't
they
say,
well,
we
saw
this
man
before
we
stopped
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course
we
know
it's
too
loud.
it's
always
too
loud.
