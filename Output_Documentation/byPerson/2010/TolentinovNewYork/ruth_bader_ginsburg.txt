justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
--
is
there
any
case
in
this
court
where
what
was
suppressed
was
information
that
was
lawfully
in
the
government's
possession,
as
opposed
to
evidence
that
was
acquired
originally
through
the
search?
here
we
have
the
dmv
records,
they're
public
records.
i
don't
know
of
any
decision
of
this
court
that
deals
with
suppression
of
evidence
that
is
already
in
the
government's
possession,
and
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
you
tell
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
police
following
mr.
tolentino
had
noted
down
his
license
plate,
and
then
got
this
information,
not
as
a
result
of
his
driver's
license,
but
from
the
plate
on
the
car?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
might
show
him
as
the
owner
of
the
car.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
much
time
do
they
have
to
wait?
justice
kagan
brought
up
if
the
police
go
to
his
home
the
next
day.
you've
brought
up
attenuation
theory
a
number
of
times.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
--
i
think
now
you
have
answered,
he
gets
back
into
the
car,
drives
it
away,
they
can
do
nothing
because
it's
too
close
to
when
they
discovered
his
record
of
--
his
suspended
license.
how
much
of
an
interval
must
there
be?
what
do
you
mean
by
attenuation
doctrine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was
some
rule
about
not
being
able
to
suppress
a
person's
identity?
you've
been
asked
a
couple
of
times
why
are
you
going
after
the
dmv
record;
you
should
go
after
the
police
identification
of
joe
smith
or
whoever.
i
thought
there
was
some
rule
that
says
the
identity
of
the
person
is
not
suppressible.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
the
difference
between
stopping
a
car
and
stopping
a
person
on
the
street,
as
justice
sotomayor
asked?
you
can't
stop
somebody
on
the
street
for
no
reason.
the
person
looks
to
you
suspicious,
so
you
stop
the
person
and
say:
tell
me
your
name.
for
a
terry
stop,
you
have
to
have
reasonable
suspicion.
so
why
isn't
it
the
same
for
somebody
who
is
driving
a
car?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
something
about
the
practice
in
new
york?
i
mean,
there
is
an
artificiality
to
this
case
because
we
are
assuming
that
the
stop
was
unlawful.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
police
said
it
was
lawful,
because
the
radio
was
blasting
so
loud.
why
did
this
issue
even
--
the
issue
of
"suppose
it
was
unlawful"
even
come
up,
instead
of
the
city
or
the
county
saying
what
the
police
stopped
him
for
was
a
traffic
violation,
was
perfectly
legal?
why
get
to
the
constitutional
question
when
there's
staring
the
prosecutor
the
court
in
the
face
the
argument
that
this
was
a
lawful
stop?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mentioned
some
--
before
you
finish,
you
--
you
said
a
name
is
not
suppressible,
and
that's
because
this
court
held
--
we
started
out
by
saying
the
observation
of
the
person
that
dropped
out
of
this
case,
so
we're
talking
only
about
records,
but
the
extraction
of
a
name,
you
say
that's
not
suppressible,
even
though
it
was
unlawfully
extracted
because
there
were
no
reasonable
suspicions
that
this
person
did
anything
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
because
when
he
entered
a
guilty
plea,
you
reserved
only
the
question
concerning
the
motor
vehicle
records;
you
didn't
reserve
any
other
questions.
