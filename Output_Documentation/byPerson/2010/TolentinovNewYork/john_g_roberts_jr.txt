chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
09-11556,
tolentino
v.
new
york.
ms.
schwarz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
only
way
that
the
police
can
prevent
an
unlicensed
driver
from
driving
in
this
situation
is
to
take
away
his
car?
impound
the
car,
as
you
say?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
unless
they
want
--
for
any
offense,
you
know,
expired
driver's
license.
expired
last
week.
they
can't
just
give
the
guy
--
they
can't
give
the
guy
a
ticket,
right?
all
they
can
do
is
take
away
his
car?
your
answer
to
a
number
of
the
questions
has
been
that
--
that
have
tried
to
address
the
issue
of
what
are
they
supposed
to
do,
since
they
know
they
have
somebody
who
is
violating
the
law,
is
that,
well,
they
can
take
away
the
car.
and
i
just
want
to
know
if
that's
the
only
permissible
response
by
the
police
when
they
know
that
the
person
driving
has
violated
the
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
totally
illegal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
totally,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
only
way
to
prevent
him
from
reoffending
immediately
is
to
impound
the
car?
because
if
he
gets
into
the
car
and
drives,
then
--
or
can
the
police
arrest
him
right
away?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
not?
why
wouldn't
they--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
that
your
answer,
then:
they've
got
to
impound
the
car
every
time
or
let
the
guy
just
go?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
could
tell
him
not
to
drive
until
he
clears
up
his
license?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
schwarz.
ms.
halligan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
--
is
your
position
that
they
can
do
anything
in
terms
of
the
search
of
a
name?
could
they
punch
it
into
google
or
something
like
that
and
find
out
a
lot
more
than
just
what
they
have
in
their
own
possession?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
--
i
know
it
raises
a
different
question,
but
you
know,
you
keep
saying
they're
just
--
or
you
know,
you're
just
talking
about
the
name,
but
names
are
meaningless
in
the
abstract.
it's
not
just
that
the
officer
wants
to
know
what
to
call
him.
it's
what
he
wants
to
find
out
from
the
name.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
these
days
there's
so
many
electronic
databases,
you
can
find
out
an
awful
lot
just,
you
know,
with
the
punch
of
a
few
--
a
few
buttons.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
it's
not
limited
to
suggesting
danger
or
whatever.
it's
--
it
can
--
that
may
be
what
the
officer
on
the
scene
is
most
interested
in,
of
course,
but
once
you
get
the
guy's
name
you're
interested
in
a
lot
of
things.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they're
not
suppressing
the
knowledge
of
someone's
identity.
all
that
--
what's
being
suppressed
is
the
evidence
of
criminal
activity
that
you
derive
from
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
--
you
make
the
point
that
these
records
are
already
in
the
government's
possession.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
isn't
that
true
of
everything
that's
available
on
any
type
of
database?
everything
in
google
or
whatever
the
other
search
engines
are
is
in
the
government's
possession
in
the
sense
that
they've
got
it;
all
they've
got
to
do
is
identify
it
in
their
search,
and
they've
got
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
can't
make
a
difference
on
whose
server
it
is,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
information
that
they
can
get
if
they
have
the
correct
way
of
searching
it,
which
is
here
by
name.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
these
things
public
records?
if
i
wanted
to
find
out
if
you
had
been,
you
know,
stopped
for
driving
without
a
license,
can
i
find
that
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
halligan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
shah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
everything
that
the
government
has
access
to
through
any
database
considered
in
the
government's
possession?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
said
--
as
you
phrased
it,
i
thought
it
was
in
the
government's
possession.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what's
the
difference?
in
either
case,
they
need
some
search
term,
and
then
they
will
get
the
answers.
i
don't
see
why
it
makes
a
difference.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
--
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
it's
in
the
--
the
government
of
colorado's
possession,
and
they
have
an
arrangement
with
new
york
that
they
will
let
them
check
their
files
to
find
out,
you
know,
whatever
it
is,
nationwide
or
something?
does
that
--
your
argument
apply
to
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
shah.
ms.
schwarz,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
suppose
would
subject
the
police
officers
to
liability,
though,
right?
in
civil
actions?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
09-11556,
tolentino
versus
new
york,
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
