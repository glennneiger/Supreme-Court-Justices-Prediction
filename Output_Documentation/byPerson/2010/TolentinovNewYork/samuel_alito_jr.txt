justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
that
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--suppose
that
--
that
you
had
won
at
the
trial
level;
the
judge
suppresses
everything
and
dismisses
the
indictment;
and
mr.
tolentino
walks
out
of
the
courtroom
and
is
observed
by
the
officer
that
conducted
the
stop
in
this
case.
the
officer
sees
him
getting
into
a
car
and
driving
away,
even
though
his
license
is
still
suspended.
now,
could
--
could
he
be
arrested
for
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
though
the
officer
would
have
no
reason
to
know
that
this
particular
person
has
a
suspended
license
were
it
not
for
the
chain
of
events
that
followed
from
the
initial
allegedly
illegal
stop?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
let
me
ask
a
related
question.
suppose
that
after
you
filed
your
suppression
motion
the
--
the
state
of
new
york
became
nervous
about
this
issue
and
they
checked
all
the
surveillance
cameras
in
the
vicinity
of
the
stop,
and,
lo
and
behold,
they
found
a
tape
showing
mr.
tolentino
driving
the
car
shortly
before
the
stop
here.
could
he
be
prosecuted
for
illegal
--
for
driving
without
a
license,
with
a
suspended
license,
using
that
evidence?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
in
light
of
those
two
answers,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
your
real
problem
here
is
not
with
the
--
the
dmv
records.
it's
with
the
police
officer's
observation
after
the
stop
that
mr.
tolentino
was
driving
the
car.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
not
the
argument
you
seem
to
be
making.
you
want
to
suppress
the
knowledge
that
the
police
derived
from
the
stop
that
mr.
tolentino's
license
is
suspended,
and
you
would
allow
an
exception
to
that
only
if
there
was
attenuation.
but
why
isn't
the
simpler
solution
to
a
case
like
this
that
you
can't
suppress
the
knowledge
of
matters
that
are
in
a
government
record,
however
you
can
suppress
observations
by
the
police
on
the
scene
that
flow
directly
from
the
illegal
stop?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
that
when
--
when
the
police
stopped
this
particular
car,
they
saw
that
mr.
tolentino
was
smoking
marijuana
or
snorting
cocaine
or
drinking
from
a
bottle
of
alcohol
or
he
had
somebody
tied
up,
bound
and
gagged
on
the
back
seat
of
the
car.
now,
all
of
those
things
would
clearly
be
the
fruit
--
all
those
observations
would
clearly
be
the
fruit
of
the
allegedly
illegal
stop,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
though
they
were
in
plain
view,
they
would
all
be
suppressed,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you're
saying
that
the
observation
that
mr.
tolentino
is
at
the
wheel
of
the
car,
that
is
not
suppressed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
go
back
and--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--could
i
go
back
and
ask
you
to
--
to
explain
what
--
how
you
--
you
think
the
--
the
request
for
suppression
of
the
police
officer's
observation
was
waived?
that
was
raised
in
the
motion
to
suppress,
page
17a
of
the
joint
appendix.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
the
--
the
new
york
supreme
court
apparently
didn't
understand
that
that
issue
was
in
the
case
and
ruled
only
on
suppression
of
the
records
and
tangible
evidence,
is
that
right,
78a?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
--
what
is
mr.
tolentino
supposed
to
do
at
that
point
to
preserve
the
issue
of
the
suppression
of
a
police
officer's
observation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
defendant
raises
an
issue
before
the
trial
judge,
the
trial
judge
ignores
that
issue,
misses
the
issue--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
then
the
defendant
waives
the
issue
unless
the
defendant
says
by
the
way,
you
missed
--
you
failed
to
address
one
of
the
arguments
that
i
made?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
does
seem
rather
strange.
that
would
have
been,
like,
a
10-minute
hearing.
why
did
you
stop
him?
well,
he
was
playing
the
music
too
loud.
defendant
testifies,
i
wasn't
playing
my
music
too
loud.
the
trial
judge
says,
well,
i
believe
you,
or
i
believe
you,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
it
does
seem
really
--
that's
how
things
are
done
in
trial
court
in
new
york
city?
you
jump
to
these
big
constitutional
issues
and--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
they
--
they
--
they
break
into
the
house
with
an
axe,
and
they
find
out
the
name,
they
see
this
guy
is
dagwood,
and
so
they
run
that
through
their
--
their
database,
and
they
find
this
is
the
guy
we've
been
looking
for,
for
the
last
20
years.
he
is
responsible
for
all
the
drugs
that
come
into
this
country,
he's
committed
numerous
acts
of
terrorism,
he's
a
--
he's
a
serial
killer,
he's
killed
50
people,
we've
been
chasing
him
forever,
and
so
the
--
the
result
would
be
all
that
knowledge,
that
this
is
dagwood
is
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
and
nothing
can
be
done
about
dagwood?
