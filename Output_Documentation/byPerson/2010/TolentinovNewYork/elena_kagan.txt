ms.
schwarz,
suppose--
justice
elena
kagan
--i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
schwarz,
suppose
the
police
arrest
the
guy,
find
out
who
he
is,
don't
--
stop
the
guy,
find
out
who
he
is,
don't
arrest
him,
but
then
now
they
know
that
this
is
the
kind
of
guy
who
drives
without
a
license.
and
so
they
go
to
his
house
the
next
day
and
they
see
him
getting
back
in
the
car.
could
they
arrest
him
then?
justice
elena
kagan
so
the
re-offense
--
the
re-offense
just
cuts
off
the
original
taint?
justice
elena
kagan
because
you
could
say
that
if
he
got
back
in
the
car
right
after
the
stop,
if
the
police
for
some
reason
did
not
impound
the
car
and
he
got
back
in
the
car,
that's
another
offense,
and
so
by
your
theory,
then
they
could
properly
arrest
him
and
use
all
of
this
knowledge
in
a
prosecution?
justice
elena
kagan
so,
ms.
halligan,
suppose
--
you're
suggesting
there
should
be
an
exception
for
knowledge
of
identity.
suppose
there
were
a
clearly
illegal
search
and
the
government
is
looking
for
a
head
of
some
kind
of
criminal
syndicate
and
knows
this
only
by
an
alias,
all
right;
and
--
and
finds
out
as
a
result
of
this
illegal
search
--
pick
your
--
pick
your
alias,
you
know,
john
smith
--
finds
out,
you
know
--
finds
out
that
this
person
whose
house
they're
searching
is
john
smith,
is
the
head
of
this
criminal
syndicate.
can
the
government
then
use
that
knowledge
of
identity,
knowledge
that
this
person
goes
under
this
alias,
in
order
to
build
a
case
around
this
guy?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
they
find
out
this
person's
alias
as
the
result
of
the
illegal
search,
and
that
allows
them
to
build
a
substantial
criminal
case.
justice
elena
kagan
so
there's
a
diary,
and
it
says:
i
am
john
smith.
that's
keyser
soze.
[laughter]
i
am
keyser
soze.
that
would
not
be
suppressible?
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
that
that's
not
right,
ms.
halligan,
because
the
search
is
the
poisonous
tree.
now,
it
might
be
that
the
name
can't
be
suppressed,
but
it
still
might
be
that
everything
that's
discovered
as
a
result
of
knowing
the
name,
which
would
never
be
discovered
unless
the
search
had
taken
place,
could
be
suppressible.
justice
elena
kagan
why
does
it--
justice
elena
kagan
--your
government
records
argument,
is
it
limited
to
new
york
city
records
or
does
it
also
apply
to
fbi
records,
to
records
of
other
cities
and
states
which,
presumably,
would
be
available
on
a
reciprocal
basis?
justice
elena
kagan
how
about
private
databases
that
are
going
to
be
available
to
the
government
upon
request?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
shah,
how
would
you
think
about
this
problem?
suppose
the
police
start
stopping
people
and
rather
than
asking
for
your
name,
they
take
a
blood
sample,
they
prick
your
finger,
and
then
they
take
that
blood
and
they
look
in
their
very
extensive
dna
databases,
and
they
discover,
oh,
this
is
a
guy
who,
you
know,
did
these
various
terrible
things,
and
start
building
cases.
would
that
be
all
right?
