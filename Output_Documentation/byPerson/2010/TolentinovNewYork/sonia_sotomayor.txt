justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
suggesting
that
it's
okay
for
the
police
to
walk
up
to
any
citizen,
anywhere,
and
say,
you're
under
arrest
until
you
give
me
your
name?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
there's
--
there's
been
no
doubt
here
that
it
was
a
stop
without
suspicion.
that's
been
presumed.
so
how
is
that
different
from
what
i
just
asked
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
they
took
a
person
randomly,
detained
them
without
any
suspicion,
and
said
give
me
your
name.
are
you
suggesting
that
that's
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
am
presuming.
i
know
that
there's
counter-arguments
to
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
isn't
the
eliciting
of
the
name
as
a
result
of
an
unlawful
stop
something
that
could
be
suppressed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
name
is
different
than
the
person,
the
body
of
the
person,
which
has
to
do
with
the
court's
jurisdiction.
but
why
isn't
the
name
any
different
than
a
wallet
that's
in
somebody's
pocket
or
a
shirt
or
a
hat,
whatever
is
on
the
person?
why
is
a
name
not
subject
to
suppression?
let's
go
past
what
happens
here,
because
i
understand
the
disconnect
between
the
name,
the
dmv
record,
and
seeing
the
person
driving.
how
we
tie
those
together
are
a
different
issue.
but
you
made
a
bold
statement
when
you
started.
you
said
that
the
police
securing
a
name
is
never
suppressible.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
do
you
see
no
difference
between
crews
and
bynum,
in
the
typical
case
where
the
evidence
against
the
defendant
is
not
developed
as
a
result
of
an
illegal
stop
--
it
exists
independent
of
that
stop
--
and
one
in
which
the
stop
itself
creates
the
ground
for
arrest?
don't
you
see
a
difference
between
those
two
things?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
there
was
no
suspicion
of
that
when
that
person
was
stopped.
the
suspicion
to
arrest
arose
not
independent
of
the
illegality,
but
as
part
of
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
all
of
the
evidence
at
trial
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fingerprint.
it
had
to
do
with
the
victims
and
everyone
else
walking
in
and
saying,
that's
the
guy
who
did
lie
to
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
the
arrest.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
are
you
agreeing
with
your
adversary
that
you
abandoned
and
are
not
entitled
to
raise
the
suppressibility
of
the
observation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
if
you're
not,
in
what
ways
is
it
tied
to
the
question
presented
about
identity,
which
is
the
issue
you
sought
cert
on?
