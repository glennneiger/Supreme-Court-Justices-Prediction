justice
antonin
scalia
was
--
was
--
was
the
poisonous
fruit
the
dmv
records,
or
was
the
poisonous
fruit
the
fact
that
this
person
who
is
contained
in
the
records
was
the
one
driving
the
car?
why
wasn't
that
the
--
why
wasn't
that
the
fruit?
i
mean,
the
records
were
there
anyway.
what
--
what
--
what
new
information
came
from
the
stop
was
the
fact
that
that
is
the
person
who
was
driving
the
car.
why
--
why
didn't
--
why
wasn't
that
what
should
have
been
suppressed?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
agree
with
you
on
that
fruit.
did
--
did
you
ask
for
that
to
be
suppressed?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
what's
before
us
here,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
--
not
if
you
allow
the
suppression
of
the
policeman's
identification
of
the
individual
driving
the
car.
i
mean,
that
--
nobody's
contending
that
that
can't
be
suppressed.
so
if
you
can't
bring
in
the
policeman
to
say,
yes,
this
fellow
smith,
whose
record
we
have
here,
was
the
fellow
driving
the
car.
once
that's
out,
what
incentive
is
there
to
make
these
suspicionless
stops?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i'm
saying
is,
you're
getting
at
it
from
the
wrong
end.
what
should
have
been
suppressed
was
the
policeman's
identification
of
the
person
who
was
driving
the
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
--
it
gets
you
nowhere
to
say
john
smith.
you
have
to
say
john
smith
was
driving
the
car.
it's
the
driving
of
the
car
that
you
want
suppressed.
that's
not
the
identity.
i
mean,
john
smith,
fine,
you
can
say
john
smith,
john
smith,
john
smith
all
you
like
at
court.
it's
--
it's
not
going
to
get
a
conviction.
but
when
you
say
john
smith
was
driving
the
car,
then
you
are
eliciting
testimony
from
the
officer
concerning
information
he
would
not
have
had
but
for
the
stop,
that
john
smith
was
driving
the
car,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
going
to
ask
that.
she
said
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
--
your
friend
said
that
it
was
raised
below.
what
--
what
happened
to
it?
