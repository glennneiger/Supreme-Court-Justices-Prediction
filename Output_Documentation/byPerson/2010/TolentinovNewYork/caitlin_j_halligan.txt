ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
with
your
question,
justice
breyer,
about
what
the
ruling
below
was
and
what's
at
stake
in
this
case.
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
quite
narrow.
it
said
--
and
i'm
reading
from
page
105a
of
the
appendix:
"we
merely
hold
that
a
defendant
may
not
invoke
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
when
the
only
link
between
improper
police
activity
and
the
disputed
evidence
is
that
the
police
learned
the
defendant's
name.
"
so
the
court
of
appeals
is
focusing
on
the
fact
that
all
that
was
elicited
here
is
the
name
of
the
defendant,
and
that's
appropriate.
asking
a
name
is
fundamental
to
any
encounter
between
police
and
citizens,
and
that's
because
the
officer--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
because--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--no,
i'm
not.
the
legality
of
the
stop
here
has
not
been
adjudicated.
we
are
presuming
that
the
police
acted
illegally.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
we
are
not
at
all
challenging
this
court's
decisions,
certainly
not
delaware
v.
prouse
or
any
others,
which
hold
that
the
police
may
not
stop
someone
without
basis
and
may
not
certainly
enforce
the
sort
of
statute
that
was
at
issue
in
hiibel
without
some
basis
for
asking
for
identification--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--it
should
not
be
subject
to
suppression,
and
that's
a
distinct
question
from
whether
or
not
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
that
occurred
in
the
stop
and
the
asking
of
the
name.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
because
it
has
a
unique
status,
as
this
court
recognized
in
hiibel,
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
asking
for
a
name
is
a
routine
and
accepted
part
of
any
stop
because
the
officer
needs
to
know
who
he's
dealing
with.
he
faces
an
inordinate
risk,
as
this
court
noted
in
mimms
and
most
recently
in
arizona
v.
gant,
of
being
shot
when
he
approaches
a
car.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i
think
it
is
the
same
in
terms
of
what
the
fourth
amendment
requires,
and
delaware
v.
prouse
holds
that.
we're
not
taking
issue
with
that
or
asking
this
court
to
retreat
from
that.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
where
all
that
is
elicited
is
the
name,
it's
not
appropriate
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule,
which
is
a
very
distinct
question.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
in
your
hypothetical
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
would
be
any
fifth
amendment
issues
that
would
be
at
play,
but--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--if
all
that
is
obtained
is
the
name,
then
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
applied.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
the
diary
itself,
the
document
would
be
suppressible.
the
knowledge
that
that
person
is
the
--
is
keyser
soze
would
not
be
subject
to
suppression,
and
knowledge
should
never
be
something
that
is
subject
to
suppression,
in
any
event.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
that's
correct,
and--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i
would
like
to
distinguish
between
the
observation
of
the
person
driving
the
car,
to
the
extent
that
you
might
have
a
case
in
which
that
observation
is
made
after
the
stop
as
opposed
to
before
the
stop;
that's
a
different
and
distinct
question.
it's
not
presented
in
the
case
that's
before
the
court
right
now
--
from
the
question
of
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
applied
when
only
the
name
is
elicited.
the
observations,
it
may
be
as
--
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested
that
under
crews,
because
the
physiognomy
of
a
person
--
five
justices
determined
there
the
appearance
is
not
something
that's
subject
to
suppression,
the
police
officer's
observation
that
it
was
in
fact
this
individual
who
looks
like
this
driving
the
car
would
not
be
subject
to
suppression,
either.
but
that's
not
presented.
all
that
is
at
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
the
elicitation
of
the
name
and
the
records
directly
linked
to
that
are
subject
to
suppression.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
pardon?
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
well--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--well,
that's
right,
and
that's
why
part
of
why
a
name
should
not
be--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--you
could
resolve
the
case
on
the
theory
that
by
definition
government
records
that
are
previously
held--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--in
this
case
the
question
of
any
observations
of
the
defendant
is
waived.
it
was
abandoned
by
operation
of
state
law.
you
could
have
another
case
in
which
that
at
issue.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
what
happened
is
this:
in
the
suppression
motion
initially,
the
defendant
sought
to
suppress
a
number
of
things,
including
the
observations
of
the
police.
the
trial
court
judge
did
not
rule
specifically
on
that
aspect
of
the
suppression
motion.
the
trial
court
judge
said
that
there
would
be
a
suppression
hearing
on
the
statement
that
the
defendant
made,
but
there
would
not
be
a
suppression
hearing
with
regard
to
the
dmv
records
because
dmv
records
were
not
subject
to
suppression.
at
that
point
the
defendant
pled
guilty,
and
so
by
operation
of
state
law
--
because
first
of
all
there
was
not
a
ruling
specifically
on
the
question
of
observations
and
the
defendant
failed
to
bring
that
to
the
trial
court
judge's
attention,
and
because
the
guilty
plea
was
taken,
and
you
can
only
appeal
when
you
plead
guilty
on
a
suppression
motion
where
there's
a
final
order,
there's
no
final
order
on
the
observation.
that's
out
of
the
case,
that
would
be
our
position.
you
could
have
a
subsequent
case
where
that
question
would
be
presented
if,
in
fact,
an
officer
does
not
see
a
defendant
until
after
he
approaches
the
car,
and
in
that
case
he
would
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
crews
and
the
five
justices,
which
says
the
physiognomy
of
the
defendant
is
not
subject
to
suppression,
controls
and
therefore
allows
the
observations
to
come
in;
but
it's
not
presented
here.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i
think
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor,
but
here
you
have
records
that
not
only
are
in
the
government's
possession
--
and
this
court
never
has
suggested--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--the--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--you
could,
and
i
think
that
that's
why
if
the
court
was
concerned
about
the
potential
breadth
of
that
holding,
it
could
narrow
it
to
the
use
of
the
name
to
link
to
government
records.
in
the
field,
in
particular,
what
an
officer
is
going
to
look
for
is
records
that
suggest
danger,
so
for
example
what
the
officers
have
in
new
york
state
is
they--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--that's
right,
and
that's
because
you
are
in
the
process
of
conducting
some
sort
of
investigation,
and
to
suppress
the
knowledge
of
someone's
identity
would
--
would
blink
reality.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i
think
it's
very
different
than
when
you
have
drugs
in
a
car
which
could
clearly
be
subject
to
suppression.
all
that
you
have
here,
first
of
all,
that's
elicited,
is
the
name.
the
name
itself
is
not
subject
to
suppression,
nor
did
the
defendant
seek
to
have
it
suppressed,
as
the
court
of
appeals
observed.
and
so
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
if
the
antecedent
piece
of
evidence
is
not
subject
to
suppression
then
there's
no
poison
that
can
flow
from
that
to
contaminate
anything
like
the
dmv
record.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
two
points,
justice
kagan.
i
believe,
first
of
all,
that
if
the
name
is
not
suppressed
and
then
something
flows
from
the
name,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
skip
that
step
and
then
suppress
something
that
comes
further
down
the
road.
but,
secondly,
the
fact
that
these
records
were
already
in
the
government's
possession
is
precisely
what
takes
this
outside
the
scope
of
the
fruits
doctrine.
the
fruits
--
fruits
doctrine
has
been
held
to
apply
repeatedly
in
cases
where
the
evidence
is
in
some
sense
the
product
of
the
illegal
government
activity.
these
records
are
simply
not
the
product
of
any
government
activity.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
yes.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
to
preserve
the
issue,
mr.
tolentino
should
have
raised
that
fact
to
the
judge,
should
have
pointed
it
out
pursuant
to
cplr
71070,
subsection
(2).
there's
also
case
law
explaining
that
when
that
happens,
that
is
the
obligation
of
the
defendant
and
the
defendant
cannot
raise
the
issue
on
appeal
if
it's
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
judge
at
that
point.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
and
then
the
defendant
pleads
guilty.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
at
the
point
at
which
the
defendant
pleads
guilty,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
defendant
pled
guilty
prior
to
seeking
any
ruling
on
that,
specifically,
or
any
clarification.
none
of
this
is
--
is
briefed
before
the
court,
but
the
defendant
also
did
not
raise
the
issue
of
the
observations
in
the
brief
to
the
intermediate
state
appellate
court,
the
state
court
of
appeals
or
this
court.
so
it
has
been
deemed
abandoned
a
long
time
ago.
and
in
the
oral
argument
before
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
defendant
seemed
to
concur
in
the
fact
that
it
had
been
abandoned.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
yes.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
well,
this
is
in
the
government's
possession
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
word,
and
in
fact
to
correct
something
that
was
said
previously,
although
it's
not
in
the
record,
the
dmv
records,
along
with
other
records,
such
as
arrest
warrants,
are
in
fact
in
the
nypd's
possession.
they
use
a
database
that
the
state
police
generate
which
they
download
onto
their
server.
so
they
have
it
in
their
actual
possession,
which
is
different
from--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--no,
i'm
simply
saying
that
it
is
in
their
possession.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
and
--
and
the
fact
that
they
are
drawn
to
the
records
because
they
have
stopped
this
individual
and
they
have
this
name
does
not
disqualify
them
from
using
those
records.
this
court
has
cited
several
times
with
approval
to
a
case
called
bynum
in
the
d.c.
circuit
in
which
there
were
prints
that
were
taken
following
an
illegal
detention,
and
those
prints
were
suppressed.
the
prosecution
knew
that
the
defendant
had
committed
the
crime,
because
those
prints
had
been
taken
and
matched,
and
the
defendant
--
or
the
prosecution
was
allowed
to
use
a
set
of
prints
that
it
already
had
in
its
files
on
retrial.
the
same
thing
happened
in
both
davis
and
hayes.
in
fact,
in
both
of
those
cases,
there
were
convictions
on
remand,
and
the
prosecution's
attention
was
drawn
to
the
defendant
only
following
some
illegal
activity.
i
would
like
to--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
the
prosecutor
made
two
arguments
on
the
--
in
response
to
the
suppression
motion.
one
was
that
the
dmv
records
were
not
subject
to
suppression
as
a
category.
the
second
was,
as
you
say,
that
the
stop
was
legal.
the
trial
court
judge
ruled
only
on
the
first
ground
and
did
not
hold
a
hearing
to
adjudicate
the
facts
of
the
stop,
and
so
that's
why
it
comes
to
you
in
this
posture.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i'm
not
sure
that
anyone
realized
that
this
case
would
--
would
eventually
come
before
this
court,
but
that
is
the
way
this
particular
case.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
there's
actually
a
provision
of
the
new
york
city
administrative
code,
your
honor,
which
is
on
point--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--frankly,
i
think
that's
a
difficult
question,
your
honor.
there
are
certain
entities
to
which
driving
records
can
be
disclosed
pursuant
to
the
federal
driver's
privacy
protection
act,
and
there
are
also
certain
restrictions.
so
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
would
depend
on
who
was
asking.
but
they
are
certainly
the
administrative
adjudications
that
are
made
by
a
judge
in
traffic
court,
and
in
that
sense,
they
are
every
bit
as
valid
a
record
as
the
decision
of
any
other
court.
there
are
simply
certain
protections
with
regard
to
dmv
records
specifically.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i
think
it
would
apply
to
records
available
on
a
reciprocal
basis,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
touch
on
the--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--i
guess
i
would
say
that
what
creates
the
grounds
for
arrest
here
is
the
fact
that
the
individual
was
driving
with
a
suspended
license,
and
no--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--but
so,
too,
with
bynum.
it
was
the
match
of
the
prints
that
caused
the
prosecutor
to
realize
that
this
individual
was
guilty--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--i
believe
in
bynum,
your
honor,
the
prints
were
critical,
and
here
the
only
element--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--no,
in
the
adjudication
itself.
the
appellate
decision
--
may
i
finish
my
answer?
on
remand
in
bynum
went
back,
suggests
that
the
ability
to
locate
those
prior
prints
in
the
fbi
file
was
essential
to
the
conviction
there.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
thank
you.
