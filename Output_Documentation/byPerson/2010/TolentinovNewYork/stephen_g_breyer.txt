justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
alito.
maybe
i
mixed
it
up.
the
police
stop
the
car
without
cause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
illegal
stop.
and
you
say
as
a
result
of
the
stop
they
found
out
all
these
things
in
the
records,
that
he
had
no
license,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
shouldn't
be
introduced
into
his
trial
for
driving
without
a
license.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
the
question
i
had
heard
put
was,
suppose
after
they
got
this
information,
they
don't
arrest
him
then,
but
he
gets
into
the
car
again
and
starts
driving.
you
said
then
they
could
arrest
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
why?
why
isn't
--
why
isn't
that
just
as
much
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree?
they
found
out
he
doesn't
have
a
license
by
the
record
which
came
to
them
from
an
illegal
stop.
i
just
don't
understand
it.
did
i
get
you
right
as
to
what
you
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
therefore
they
couldn't
arrest
him.
so
what
they
do
is
they
--
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
see
--
they
see
he
--
they
stopped
him,
they
get
the
records,
wrongly.
they
see
he
has
no
license.
he
says:
how
did
you
know?
because
we
just
looked
at
your
license.
that
was
illegal;
good-bye,
gets
into
the
car
and
drives
off,
and
they
can
do
nothing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right
or
not?
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
how
could
they
--
they
can
impound
the
car.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
--
what
is
that
word,
the
"bad
faith"?
i
take
it
your
rule
is
identical
if
when
they
wrongly
stop
the
car,
they
look
up
the
records,
the
records
say
he
has
no
license,
and
in
addition,
he's
wanted
on
17
drug
warrants
and
for
3
triple
axe
murders.
again,
you
can't
do
anything
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
can
you?
you
cannot
do
anything
about
it
or
you
can?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
how?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if,
in
fact,
a
policeman
stops
a
person
without
cause
and
learns
as
a
result
of
that
that
there
are
many
warrants
outstanding
against
him,
he
then
can
arrest
the
person,
and
--
but
can
he
introduce
those
warrants
into
court
as
evidence
or
whatever
if
it's
relevant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
the
way
that
the
policeman
stops
the
person
and
gets
the
information
illegally
is
he
takes
an
axe
and
breaks
into
the
house,
the
policeman,
and
thereby
--
what
i'm
showing
--
i
just
think
this
case
has
lots
of
implications,
and
i'm
looking
for
a
rule
here
that's
going
to
work
in
a
lot
of
different
situations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
say
that
if,
in
fact,
he
learns
that
this
man
from
the
public
records
is
a
triple
axe
murderer--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--he
can
do
nothing
about
it,
i
said?
and
you
said
no,
he
can
do
something
about
it.
i
just
wanted
to
know
the
distinction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
happens
to
be
a
description
of
the
individual,
not
a
warrant,
he
gets
from
the
public
record
which
is
read
off
to
him
when
he
calls
in,
a
description:
a
red
tie.
can
he
use
that
and
introduce
it
into
evidence?
i
mean,
is
this
case
about
--
what's
it
about,
driving?
or
does
it
have
broader
implications?
i
thought
that
the
court
had
held
that
any
public
record
at
all
is
immune.
is
that
right?
immune
from
the
normal
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
i
was
testing
that.
i
want
to
know:
is
that,
in
your
opinion,
a
correct
rule
in
all
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
not
an
incorrect
rule,
the
opposite
rule.
no
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
made
a
mistake
and
said:
i'm
driving
the
car.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
made
a
mistake.
he
said
in
court:
i
was
driving
the
core
--
car.
he
never
should
have
said
it.
all
right,
now
once
he
said
it,
now
we
know
he's
driving
the
car.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
now
you're
saying
why
does
this
case
even
come
up?
because
once
you
have
his
name,
the
second
he
said
it
in
court
you
could
go
up
looking
his
--
you
could
go
look
at
his
--
his
records
anyway;
you
could
find
all
these
--
the
facts
about
him
which
i
guess
could
you
bring
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
this
case
shouldn't
be
a
special
rule,
it
should
just
be
a
case
of
--
what
is
it
called?
it's
a
doctrine,
you
would
have
found
it
anyway;
inevitable
discovery.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they're
only
inevitably
discovered
if
he
makes
a
mistake
of
saying
what
his
name
is.
no,
no,
not
that
--
the
mistake
of
saying:
i
was
driving
the
car.
and
then,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
maybe
you
could
suppress
that,
so
it
would
--
it
would--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--wait.
one--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
find
confusing.
let's
imagine
the
policeman
goes
with
a
hatchet
and
breaks
into
somebody's
house
illegally.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there,
he
sees
on
the
desk
the
name
is
dagwood.
with
other
information,
he
goes
to
a
certain
alley
and
starts
shouting
"dagwood"
and
people
shower
him
with
drugs.
you
have
no
doubt,
if
that
is
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree,
an
out,
correct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's
how
they
--
they
knew
the
name,
they
got
the
evidence,
they
get
to
the
place.
without
the
name,
they
wouldn't
have
gotten
the
drugs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
out,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
illegally.
very
illegally.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
his
name.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
wondered
if
you
were
going
to
also
say
in
my
example,
which
i
could
make
more
realistic
with
more
time,
which
you
don't
want
to
give
me,
the
--
but
--
that
he
uses
the
name,
and
as
a
result
gets
all
kinds
of
evidence
in
the
form
of
drugs,
murder
victims,
whatever
you
want.
have
you
any
doubt
that
that
would
be
suppressible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
not
suppressible
simply
because
you
get
them
through
a
name?
you
break
into
a
house,
get
a
name;
as
a
result
of
the
name,
you
know
what
criminal
enterprise
to
go
to;
as
a
result
of
that
criminal
enterprise
going
to,
you
get
every
evidence
under
the
sun,
absolute
direct
connection.
and
you
say
that's
not
suppressible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
okay.
i
just
wanted
to
know
the
ultimate
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
assume
it's
the
opposite
response.
if
it's
the
opposite
response,
for
state
of
argument,
how
is
it
any
different
whether
he's
showered
with
drugs
or
showered
with
government
records?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
i
wanted
you
to
assume
the
opposite.
i
got
--
you
win
if
my
hypothetical
--
if
it's
not
even
drugs,
it's
not
even
government
records.
but
if
it
is
drugs,
why
isn't
it
government
records?
this
won't
hurt
you
very
much,
because
often
there
will
be
an
alternative
source,
but
suppose
there
isn't.
why
are
government
records
different
from
drugs?
