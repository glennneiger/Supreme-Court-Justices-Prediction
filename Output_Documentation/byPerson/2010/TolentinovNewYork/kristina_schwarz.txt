ms.
kristina
schwarz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
held
in
delaware
v.
prouse
that,
in
the
absence
of
reasonable
suspicion,
it
is
an
unreasonable
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment
for
police
to
stop
a
car
for
the
purpose
of
checking
the
motorist's
driving
credentials.
in
brown
v.
texas,
the
court
similarly
ruled
that
police
may
not
stop
a
person
without
reasonable
suspicion
for
the
purpose
of
requiring
the
individual
to
identify
him
or
herself.
these
cases
are
grounded
in
the
principle
that
in
this
country
we
enjoy
the
right
to
go
about
our
business
free
from
government
interference
unless
or
until
the
police
have
just
cause
to
detain
us.
petitioner's
motion
to
suppress
alleged
that
the
police
acted
exactly
as
they
did
in
prouse
and
brown.
they
stopped
the
car
without
justification,
elicited
his
name,
and
gained
access
to
his
dmv
records,
which
otherwise
would
not
have
been
discovered.
instead
of
suppressing
the
poisonous
fruit
of
the
illegal
car
stop,
the
dmv
records,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
chose
to
create
a
new
categorical
rule
that
prevents
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
whenever
the
police
act
in
violation
of
prouse.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well,
justice
scalia,
that
is
also
a
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree.
as--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--yes,
that
was
asked
for
in
the
--
in
the
motion
at
the
trial
level.
in
addition--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--that's
right,
and
that's
because
the
court
below
decided
that
--
in
deciding
the
case
only
addressed
the
dmv
record,
and
--
and
indicated
that
the
dmv
records
were
not
properly
suppressible
fruit.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
and
that's
the
issue.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
yes,
justice
alito,
he
could.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well,
although
that
initial
stop
provided
the
tainted
information
that
he
didn't
have
a
license,
the
subsequent
reoffense
would
certainly
taint
the
--
the
illegality
of
the
first
stop
and
make
the
second
offense
properly--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--well,
that
--
i
believe
that
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
entirely
proper
to
prosecute
the
case.
with
that,
that
would
be
evidence
that
came
from
an
independent
source.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well,
justice
alito,
again,
all
of
--
there's
lots
of
evidence
that
could
be
properly
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree.
there
was
a
statement
made
here
that
the
petitioner
said
that
he
did
not
have
a
new
york
state
license,
there's
the
observations
of
the
officer,
and
there's
the
dmv
records.
they're
all
properly
considered
fruit,
and
in
this
case
the
dmv
records
are
of
important
evidentiary
significance.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
yes.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
there
has
been
precedent
on
that
issue.
however,
in
the
independent
source
doctrine
cases,
there
--
they've
always
required
that
the
possession
--
or
that
they
have
knowledge
of
the
information
in
order
for
it
to
defeat
the
exclusionary
rule
application.
so
in
this
case,
although
the
government
had
the
dmv
records
--
well,
first
of
all,
law
enforcement
didn't
have
the
dmv
records.
it
was
only
until
the
illegality
and
the
exploitation
of
that
illegality
that
they
acquired
the
records
from
the
department
of
motor
vehicles.
so
in
that
sense
it
was
clearly
a
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree.
but
even
if
you
look
at
government
as
an
integrated
whole,
the
prior
possession
of
the
--
the
records
was
meaningless,
of
no
value
to
them,
until
the
illegality
when
it
acquired
its
meaning.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
--
the
--
the
plates
of
the
car
would
not
indicate
the
--
the
driver's
license
of
the
driver,
and
in
this
case
mr.
tolentino--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--the
owner
of
the
car.
and
i
believe
in
respondent's
brief
they
indicated
that
--
that
some
of
the
police
computers
will
even
show
descriptive
features
or
maybe
even
a
picture
of
the
driver.
but
in
this
case
mr.
tolentino
was
not
the
registered
owner
of
the
vehicle,
so
that
wouldn't
have
provided
them
with
cause
to
pull
the
car
over.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
no,
justice
kennedy,
that's
not
what
would
happen.
the
state
would
impound
the
car.
they
would
not
allow
a
--
a
person
without
a
proper
license
to
get
back
in
the
car
and
--
and
drive
on.
that
--
in
order
for
the
petitioner
to
get
the
vehicle
back,
he
would
--
if
it
was
his
vehicle--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--because
the
--
the
impoundment
statutes
are
based
on
a
public
safety
interest,
and
so
it
doesn't--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--because
in
order
to
do
that,
it
would
be
tantamount
to
sanctioning
a
--
a
fishing
expedition
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
because
it
would
be
allowing
the
police
without
reasonable
suspicion--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--because
the
--
the
--
the
interests
are
different
and
because
it's
not
a
forever
removal
of
the
petitioner's
right
to
get
the
car,
whoever
the
--
the
rightful
owner
is.
it's
just
making
sure
that
the
petitioner
can't
get
back
in
the
car
and
continue
driving.
in
order
to
get
the
vehicle
back,
at
least
in
new
york
state,
the
--
if
it
was
the
petitioner's,
they
would
have
to
show
proof
that
they
had
a
valid
license;
and
if
it
wasn't
his
vehicle,
then
the
other
--
the
true
owner
would
have
to
get
--
provide
proper
credentials
to
establish
that
they
could
take
the
--
the
vehicle
into
their
possession;
and
also
they
would
have
to
have
proof
that
the
petitioner
himself
had
cleared
up
his
record
or
get
some
sort
of
a
--
a
release
from
the
court
or
from
the
district
attorney's
office.
so
the
whole
purpose
of
that
impoundment
statute
is
for
public
safety.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
uh-huh.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
yes.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
yes.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--justice
breyer,
what
i
--
what
i
meant
to
say
is
the
attenuation
doctrine
would
apply.
now,
if
the
person
was
--
got
back
in
his
car
immediately
at
that
scene
and
started
off
driving,
then
i'm
not
sure
that
the
attenuation
doctrine
would
--
would
--
would
kick
in.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well,
yes,
but--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--except
i
just
have
to
remind
you
that
they
--
they
could--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--impound
the
car.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
impound
the
car.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
so--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--because
of
the
statutory
rights,
the
court
--
because
they
now
know
that
he
has
no
license
to
drive,
so
either
the
car
will
--
if
there's
another
person
who
can
properly
take
possession
of
the
vehicle,
then
that
person
can
drive
off
with
the
car.
but
the
petitioner
himself,
who
doesn't
have
a
valid
license,
he
can't
get
back
in
the
car.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
and--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--well,
i'm
done.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
justice
kagan,
i
think
the
answer
would
be
yes,
and
the
reason
why
is
because
if
they
see
him
on
a
subsequent
occasion
and
they're
seeing
him
re-offend,
that
would
attenuate
the
taint
of
the
first--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--i
believe
so,
yes.
i
mean,
it
would
be
attenuation
analysis,
but
to
me
it
would
be
pretty
clear-cut
that
that's
how
it
would
resolve.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--if
the
--
if
the
stop
was--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--totally
illegal--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--then
i
don't
think
that
--
if
there
were
--
i
don't
think
that
they
could
prosecute
that
case.
they
could
--
they
couldn't
charge
him
with--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--well,
again,
that
would
be
attenuation
analysis.
but
i
think
that
the
taint
of
the
initial
illegality
would
make
that
a
much
more
difficult
case.
but
in
that
situation,
the
police
also
could
--
again,
if
there
was
another
person
who
had
authority
to
take
possession
of
the
vehicle,
that
person
could
take
the
vehicle,
the
registered
owner
or
someone
with
authority
to
do
that.
but
the
police
would
not
be
powerless
to
see
the
defendant
get
back
in
the
--
in
the
car.
i
mean,
it
would
--
that
would
be--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--because
of
the
impoundment
statutes.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well,
they
--
they
could
drive
the
person
home
to
his
house
or
take
him
to
the
corner
or
tell
him
not
to
drive
until
he
cleared
up
his
license.
they
could
do
that.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
i
--
yes.
i
mean,
that
would
be
another
alternative.
but
the
scenario
that
you
are
talking
about
would
be
highly
unlikely,
and
it
would
be
almost
in
bad
faith
if
the
police
stopped
him
illegally,
found
out
that
he
had
the
suspended
license,
and
then
let
him
get
back
in
right
away.
that
wouldn't
be
the
way
that
the
police
would
normally
do
that,
unless
there
was
a
way
to
properly
maintain
the
safety
of
the
road--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--yes.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well,
that
would
be
--
attenuation
would
be
evaluated
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
would
think
if,
even
an
hour
later,
if
the
petitioner
brazenly
drove
by
those
same
officers,
you
know,
thumbing
his
nose
at
them,
hi,
that
would
be
--
attenuation
analysis
would
apply
at
that
point.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
and
a
court
very
well
--
very
well
may
agree
with
you
on
that.
my
only
qualm
with
that
is
that
when
the
officers
illegally
find
out
that
he
has
a
suspended
license
and
then
to
let
him
get
back
in
and
immediately
arrest
him,
it's
sort
of
in
bad
faith.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
no.
no,
justice
breyer.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
you
can.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well,
the
--
the
warrants
are
entirely
different--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--because
of
the
ker-frisbie
doctrine.
the
warrants
for
--
for
other
cases
are
a
method
by
which
the
court
brings
the
body
of
the
defendant
to
court.
and
so
there
is--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--absolutely,
he
can
bring
them
in.
but
the
warrants
are
not
evidentiary.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well,
there's
--
actually,
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer,
i'm
not
sure
i
follow.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
right.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
okay.
so
there's
different
--
again,
just
to
be
clear,
the
warrant,
the
arrest
warrant,
is
not
of
evidentiary
value,
according
to
the
--
davis.
that's
not
something
that
would
be
introduced
in
court.
it's
just
a
method
for
bringing
the
defendant
into
court.
and
so
in
that
case,
they
would
properly
be
allowed
to
arrest
him.
and
if
there
was--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--the
new
york
court
of
appeals
rule
categorically
removes
it,
that's
true.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
no.
and
in
fact,
one
of
the--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--well,
it's
--
the
problem
with
that
rule,
the
categorical
rule,
is
that
it
will
create
a
fresh
incentive
for
police
officers
to
make
these
kind
of
suspicionless
stops,
and
so
it
will
encourage
police
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
and
not
only--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--because--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--ah.
yes.
and
if
--
and
if
this
case
--
if
this
case
--
we
prevail,
and
this
case
was
returned
to
trial
court,
both
of
those
issues
would
be
at
play
and
would
be
litigated.
the
observations
of
the
defendant
and
the
dmv
records
are
both
suppressible
fruit
and
both
of
them
would
be
subject
to
suppression.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well,
again,
our
position
is
that
both
of
those
items
are
properly
suppressible.
and
it's
true
in
this
circumstance
that
the
observations
would
probably
subsume
the
need
for
the
dmv
records.
however,
the
observations
may
not
be
sufficient
in
certain
circumstances.
and
in
those
cases,
it
would
be
more
important
--
it
would
be
very
important
to
have
both
of
the
items
suppressible,
and
there's
no
reason,
there's
not--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--that
--
that
is
a
restatement
of
the
ker-frisbie
doctrine,
that
essentially
says
that
a
person
cannot
suppress
himself,
his
body,
in
order
to
defeat
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
there's
--
there's
a
distinction
between
the
identity
and
the
elicitation
of
his
name,
and
the
elicitation
of
his
name
which
led
to
the
dmv
records.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well,
this
court
has
always
defined
evidentiary
fruit
as
something
that
--
of
evidentiary
value
which
the
public
authorities
have
caused
an
arrested
person
to
yield
to
them
during
an
illegal
detention,
and
that's
from
the
davis
case.
and
the
dmv
records
would
fit
that
definition
of
evidentiary
fruit.
and
in
this
case,
because
it
is
the
classic
situation
where
there's
sufficient
causal
connection
between
the
fourth
amendment
violation
and
the
subsequent
discovery
of
the
evidence
to
justify
suppression,
there's
no
reason
not
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
here,
and
in
fact,
it
meets
all
the
definition
of
the
sort
of
case
where
there
would
be
very
high
level
of
deterrence
as
a
result
of
applying
the
exclusionary
rule.
i
see
that
i
have
5
minutes.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
i
would
first
just
like
to
address
justice
breyer's
concern
about
what
the
rule
should
be,
and
--
excuse
me.
so
long
as
there's
sufficient
causal
relationship
between
the
fourth
amendment
violation
and
the
later
discovery
of
evidence,
this
court
has
expressed
continued
allegiance
to
this
rule.
so
in
this
case
the
reason
why
the
dmv
records
are
suppressible
fruit
is
it
fits
that
classic
definition.
why
are
the
observations
suppressible
when
the
identity
isn't?
that's
another
issue
that
was
raised.
the
observations
are
--
again,
they
fit
the
definition
whereas
the
identity
does
--
does
not
fit
that.
the
ker-frisbie
rule
prevents
a
person
himself
from
being
suppressible,
but
the
elicitation
of
his
name
is
something
entirely
separate.
so
in
other
words,
in
the
crews
case
a
majority
of
the
court
said
that
a
--
a
person
could
not
suppress
their
person
or
their
face
from
being
in
court;
five
of
the
justices
said
that;
but
five
justices
said
that
the
in-court
identification
could
under
certain
circumstances
be
suppressible.
so
they
drew
a
distinction
between
the
person's
body
being
brought
into
court,
which
is
not
suppressible
because
of
the
ker-frisbie
rule,
and
then
the
evidentiary
use
of
the
identity,
the
fact
that
the
five
of
the
justices
said
that
in
certain
circumstances
not
applicable
in
that
case,
the
in-court
identification
could
be
suppressible
shows
the
distinction.
and
that's
the
distinction
that
has
been
--
is
confusing
about
this
case,
because
the
elicitation
of
his
name
is
what
led
to
the
dmv
records.
but
even
if
this
court
found
that
the
elicitation
of
the
name
was
not
sufficient
or
was
somehow
related
to
ker-frisbie
and
could
not
be
suppressible,
the
dmv
records
directly
flow
from
the
fourth
amendment
violation
here,
from
the
prouse
violation.
and
so
it
really
doesn't
really
matter.
especially
in
light
of
the
decision
in
whren
to
remove
subjective
motivations
from
the
determinations
of
constitutional
reasonableness
in
car
stops,
it's
essential
to
enforce
what
remains
of
motorists'
core
fourth
amendment
rights;
and
the
whren
standards
just
must
be
enforced;
otherwise
these
core
fourth
amendment
values
will
be
undermined
and
police
will
be
left
free
to
stop
people
on
the
roads
with
no
objective
basis
and
check
their
id
and
status
and
do
fishing
expeditions
into
this
sea
of
data
that
will
be
linked
to
the
police
computers;
and
this
would
violate
prouse
and
brown

hiibel.
ms.

well,
again,
this
is
a
classic
case
where
there's
a
clear
relationship,
a
causal
relationship,
so
this
is
the
sort
of
case
where
this
court
has
continued
allegiance
to
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
where
the
exclusionary
rule
is
very
strong;
and
so
why
would
the
court
say
that
the
second
sister
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
in
this
circumstance
where
there's
sufficiently
deliberate,
that
exclusion
would
be
meaningful
and
sufficiently
culpable,
that
the
evidence
would
be
--
that
application
of
the
rule
would
be
worth
the
cost?
in
this
situation
there's
no
reason
to
abandon
the
exclusionary
rule.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
no.
well--
ms.
kristina
schwarz
--right.
i
--
i
have
no
qualms
in
my
adversary
explaining
that
the
question
presented
was
limited
because
of
the
procedure,
of
the
way
the
trial
court's
decision
was
made.
however
if
this
court
remanded
the
case,
the
question
of
whether
the
observations
were
suppressible
would
be
very
much
at
play.
ms.
kristina
schwarz
well,
but
at
the
suppression
hearing,
the
--
the
court
would
be
free
to
consider
all
of
the
suppressible
fruit,
including
the
--
the
statement
that
was
made
and
the
observations
and
also
the
dmv
records.
thank
you.
