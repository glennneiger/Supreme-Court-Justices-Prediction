mr.
pratik
a.
shah
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
seeks
to
suppress
official
records
that
were
lawfully
in
the
state's
possession
before
any
fourth
amendment
violation
occurred.
that
unprecedented
request
should
be
rejected
for
three
reasons.
one,
the
dmv
records
were
accessed
merely
through
use
of
petitioner's
name;
two,
those
records
were
produced
and
possessed
by
the
state
long
before
the
allegedly
illegal
stop
at
issue;
and,
three,
deterrence
does
not
outweigh
the
costs,
the
substantial
costs
of
suppression
under
the
circumstances
present
here.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
i
would
go
that
far
in
terms
of
our
government
records
argument.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
information--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right,
effectively
in
the
government's
possession
i
think
would
be
the
standard.
so
here
i
think
we're
talking,
not
about
google,
but
i
think
we're
talking
about
governmental
records.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
think
for
the
governmental
records
part
of
our
argument,
that
rationale
is
an
independent
rationale.
the
key
part
of
it
is
that
the
information
was
actually
in
the
government's
possession
before
the
fourth
amendment
violation
occurred.
i
think
it's
fairer
to
say
that
governmental
records
that
are
produced
and
owned
and
possessed
by
the
government
qualify.
i
think
it's
a
harder
argument
to
make
that
something--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--that
something
might
be
--
that
something
that
could
be
found
by
using
google
was
already
in
the
government's
possession
before
the
violation
occurred.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
think
it
could.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
arrangement.
if
it's
a
fully
reciprocal
arrangement
that
effectively
allows
the
state
full
access
to
those
records,
then
i
think
it
may
be
tantamount
to
the
state
having
effective
possession.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
think
--
i
think
that's
stretching
it
a
little
bit
further.
that's
a
little
bit
harder.
again,
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
state
could
be
said
to
have
effectively
have
possession
of
those
records
because,
for
example,
a
copy
of
them
are
sitting
on
their
servers
or
they
have
such
full
access
that
even
though
they're
prepared
by
a
private
database,
the
state
has
paid
for
them,
so
they're
effectively
state
records,
that
may
also
fall
within
the
scope.
but
those
are
questions
that
are
essentially
pushing
the
boundary
of
what's
effectual--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--okay.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
think
if
i
understand
your--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
they
break
into
someone's
house--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right,
and
they
find--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--they
find
the
defendant's
name?
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
right.
the
defendant's
name
itself
is
not
suppressible
under
these--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
think
the
government
could
have
an
argument
that
the
fruits
would
not
be
suppressible.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
a
couple
of
responses,
your
honor.
there
is,
first,
already
extensive
deterrent
value
from--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
okay.
so
i
think
my
--
my
response
is
that
the
fruits
are
not
necessarily
suppressible
in
your
--
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
right.
because
the
government
already
possesses
those
records.
those
records
were
within
the
government's
possession
before
any
fourth
amendment
violation
occurred.
it
would
be
depriving
the
government
of
information
it
already
had,
and
there
is
no
precedent
within
this
court's
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
that
would--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--no,
no,
your
honor.
i
want
to
be
very
clear.
my
response
is
that
that
is
not
subject
to
suppression.
and
--
and
--
and
even
my
friend
on
the
other
side
conceded
that
if
it
were
an
--
an
outstanding
arrest
warrant
such
as
in
your
hypothetical
that
would
lead
to
of
the
name,
even
if
the
name
were
a
fruit
of
an
illegal
stop
or
search,
that
that
arrest
warrant
would
still
provide
a
basis
to
arrest
the
defendant
and
prosecute
the
defendant.
now,
it
may
be
that
other
fruits
that
are
discovered
in
the
home
or
statements
taken
from
the
defendant
in
the
home
would
be
suppressed,
but
certainly
the
prosecution
could
proceed
under
the
ker-frisbie
rule,
and
any
preexisting
evidence
that
this
person
was
an
axe
murderer
or
whatever
else
evidence
that
the
government
had
would
certainly
still
be
admissible
in
the
prosecution
for
whatever.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes
--
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
a
name
is
different,
that
it's
not
suppressible,
and
we
would
rely
on
the
language
this
court
used
in
lopez-mendoza,
which
says
the
respondent's
body
or
identity
is
never
suppressible,
even
if
it's
obtained
as
a
result
of
an
illegal
search,
seizure
or
interrogation.
we
think
name
is
--
is
part
and
parcel
of
a
defendant's
identity,
and
that
it
has
a
special
status
within
--
within
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
i
think
other
types
of
biometric
evidence
that
you
suggest,
for
example,
of
blood
evidence,
might
well
implicate
competing
considerations
that
would
dictate
a
different
result.
and
let
me
suggest
a
couple
of
the
competing
considerations,
why
i
think
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
so
far
and
say
all
sorts
of
biometric
information
should
be
treated
the
same.
for
--
for
one
--
for
one
thing,
things
like
a
name
or
even
a
fingerprint,
this
court
has
said
is
not
a
separate
fourth
amendment
event
to
acquire
that.
for
example,
once
someone
is
detained,
it's
not
also
a
search
to
ask
for
their
name
or
to
take
a
fingerprint.
however,
in
your
example,
pricking
someone
with
a
needle
to
obtain
their
blood
would
be
a
separate
fourth
amendment
event,
because
that
would
be
a
separate
invasion
of
their
--
of
their
bodily
integrity,
privacy,
and
that
might
warrant
different
considerations,
since
there
are
two
violations
there.
there
might
be
a
need
for
greater
deterrent.
i
think
the
other
sort
of
consideration
that
might
be
implicated
in
--
in
that
type
of
hypothetical
is
that
evidence
unlike
a
name
or
fingerprint,
dna
evidence,
for
example,
that
you
suggest,
might
provide
competing
considerations
in
the
sense
that
it
could
lead
to
other
types
of
information
that
not
--
that
may
not
be
relevant
to
the
criminal
justice
system,
medical
records,
genetic
information.
it
may
pose
a
specter
of
other
competing
considerations
that
might
require
a
different
balance
in
the
end.
i
think
it
would
be
premature
for
this
court
to
weigh
in
one
way
or
another
as
to
whether
that
would
be
appropriate.
i
think
we
would
need
a
record
and
we
would
want
time
to
--
to
--
to
--
we
would
want
that
to
play
out
and
see
--
and
see
what
the
consequences
were.
so
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
go
that
far.
i
think
the
court
can
limit
it,
as
in
this
case,
to
name,
fingerprints
and
other
traditionally
--
other
information
traditionally
used
to
identify
a
defendant.
thank
you.
