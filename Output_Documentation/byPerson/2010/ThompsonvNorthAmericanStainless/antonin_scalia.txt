justice
antonin
scalia
is
ms.
regalado
still
engaged
to
this
fellow?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
they're
married.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
good.
well,
why
didn't
she
bring
this
suit?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
to
have
to
go
before
a
jury
as
an
employer
all
the
time.
i
want
--
i
want
a
safe
harbor.
i
don't
even
want
to
mess
with
people
that
might
--
that
might
be
buying
a
lawsuit,
and
you're
telling
me,
well,
you
know,
i
can't
help
you.
you
have
to
go
before
a
jury,
say,
if
this
person
is
close
enough.
why
can't
we
say
members
of
family
and
fiancees?
would
--
would
--
would
that
be
a
nice
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
the
chief
said,
it
--
it
spreads
much
further
than
burlington
northern.
burlington
northern,
at
least
you
know
who
it
is
you
have
to
be
careful
with:
the
person
who's
--
you
know,
who
has
made
a
complaint.
but
--
but
with
what
you're
proposing
--
my
goodness,
i
don't
know
who
it
is
i
have
to
be
careful
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
but
if
you
concede
that
she
could
have
sued,
then
what's
the
big
deal?
then
we
still
have
the
same
problem,
that
the
employer
doesn't
know
whom
he
has
to
treat
with
kid
gloves.
what's
the
difference
whether
when
the
law
comes
down
on
him,
it's
she
who
brings
the
suit
or
her
fiancee?
he's
worried
about
the
suit.
he
still
doesn't
know
whom
he
has
to
be
careful
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
that's
your
only
point,
not
that
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
for
employers
to
figure
out
who
can
be
protected
and
who
can't?
you
abandon
that
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
--
in
this
world
war
ii
nazi
scenario,
why
would
the
woman
who
caused
the
random
firing,
why
would
she
bring
a
lawsuit
if
these
people
are
really
nothing
to
her?
she
just
has
a
guilt
of
conscience
or
something?
i
mean,
i
don't
see
why
she
would
bring
the
lawsuit.
if
it
was
her
fiancee,
maybe,
but
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--she
might
not
even
like
the
people
who
were
fired.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
even
have
to
agree
with
his
description
of
what
sanders
brothers
and
the
apa
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
a
doctrine
of
the
scope
of
persons
protected
under
a
particular
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
the
word
"person
aggrieved"
bring
that
whole
lore
along
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
it's
broader.
why
do
you
say
it's
broader?
it
says
"adversely
affected
or
aggrieved
within
the
meaning
of
the
relevant
statute.
"
and
it's
that
language
that
says,
well,
the
statute
was
only
meant
to
protect
this
group
of
people,
and
the
fact
that
somebody
else
was
incidentally
harmed
would
not
be
covered.
i
don't
know
why
you
say
that's
broader.
if
anything,
it's
narrower
than
what
we
have
here.
we
just
say
"aggrieved".
it
doesn't
say
within
the
meaning
of
a
relevant
statute.
you
want
to
us
read
that
into
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--go
on,
i'm
sorry,
finish.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
where
you're
going,
the
employee
has
to
fire
three
fiancees
or
a
larger
number
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but,
you
know,
i
don't
know
what
aggrieved
means,
i
don't
think
anybody
does.
why
shouldn't
we
be
guided
by
the
eeoc,
which
has
responsibility
for
implementing
this
statute?
and
they've
come
up
with
their
theory
of
what
it
means,
and
we
usually
do
accede
to
a
reasonable
theory
proposed
by
the
implementing
agency.
why
--
why
shouldn't
we
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
--
what's
the
function
of
the
compliance
manual?
what
does
it
do?
does
it
say
we'll
--
we'll
leave
you
alone
if
you
do
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
have
to
leave
him
alone.
there's
really
nothing
the
eeoc
can
do
to
someone,
right,
except
--
what,
can
the
eeoc
take
them
to
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
can
the
justice
department,
but
we
don't
defer,
thank
goodness,
to
the
justice
department's
interpretation
of
the
criminal
law,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
22
and
23
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
until
2003,
both
petitioner
eric
thompson
and
his
fiancée,
miriam
regalado,
were
employees
of
respondent
north
american
stainless
or
nas.
in
february
2003,
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
notified
nas
that
regalado
had
filed
a
charge
alleging
sex
discrimination.
three
weeks
later,
nas
fired
thompson.
thompson
sued
nas
under
title
vii
claiming
that
the
company
had
fired
him
in
order
to
retaliate
against
regalado,
his
fiancée,
for
filing
her
charge
with
the
eeoc.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
nas
concluding
that
title
vii
does
not
permit
third
party
retaliation
claims.
the
en
banc
sixth
circuit
affirmed,
reasoning
that
because
thompson
did
not
“engage
in
any
statutorily
protective
activity,
either
on
his
own
behalf
or
on
behalf
of
miriam
regalado,
he
is
not
included
in
the
class
of
persons
for
whom
congress
created
a
retaliation
cause
of
action”.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit.
title
vii
makes
it
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
retaliate
against
an
employee
for
filing
a
charge
with
the
eeoc.
it
grants
a
cause
of
action
to
“the
person
claiming
to
be
aggrieved
by
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice”.
in
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case,
we
are
required
to
assume
that
nas
fired
thompson
in
order
to
retaliate
against
regalado
for
filing
a
charge
of
discrimination.
the
case,
therefore,
presents
two
questions.
the
first
is
whether
nas'
firing
of
thompson
constituted
unlawful
retaliation.
we
hold
that
if
the
facts
alleged
by
thompson
are
true,
it
did.
in
a
case
called
“burlington
northern
and
santa
fe
railroad
company
versus
white”,
we
held
that
title
vii's
anti-retaliation
provision
prohibits
any
employment
--
any
employer
action
that
“well
might
have
dissuaded
a
reasonable
worker
from
making
or
supporting
a
charge
of
discrimination”.
we
think
it
obvious
that
a
reasonable
worker
might
be
dissuaded
from
engaging
in
protected
activity,
if
she
knew
that
her
fiancée
would
be
fired.
the
second
and
more
difficult
question
is
whether
thompson
may
sue
nas
for
its
alleged
violation
of
title
vii.
the
statute
provides
that
“a
civil
action
may
be
brought
by
the
person
claiming
to
be
aggrieved”.
thus,
if
thompson
is
aggrieved
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
he
may
sue.
in
the
case
of
ours
from
1972
called
“trafficante
versus
metropolitan
life
insurance
company”,
we
suggested
in
a
dictum
that
the
title
vii
aggrievement
requirement
conferred
a
right
to
sue
on
all
who
met
the
minimal
requirement
for
standing
established
by
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
we
think
that
dictum
was
too
expansive.
if
any
person
injured
in
the
article
iii
sense
by
a
title
viii
violation
could
sue,
absurd
consequences
would
follow.
for
example,
a
shareholder
would
be
able
to
sue
a
company
for
firing
a
valuable
employee
for
racially
discriminatory
reasons,
so
long
as
he
could
show
that
the
value
of
his
stock
decreased
as
a
consequence.
at
the
other
extreme
is
the
position
urged
by
nas
that
“person
aggrieved”
is
a
term
of
art
that
refers
only
to
the
employee
who
engaged
in
the
protected
activity.
we
know
of
no
other
context
in
which
the
words
carry
this
artificially
narrow
meaning,
and
if
that
is
what
congress
intended
it
would
more
naturally
have
said
“person
claiming
to
have
been
discriminated
against”
rather
than
person
claiming
to
be
aggrieved.
we
see
no
basis
in
text
or
prior
practice
for
limiting
the
latter
phrase
to
the
person
who
was
the
subject
of
unlawful
retaliation.
in
our
view,
there
is
a
common
usage
of
the
term
“person
aggrieved”
that
avoids
the
extremity
of
equating
it
with
article
iii
and
yet
is
fully
consistent
with
our
application
of
the
term
in
trafficante.
the
administrative
procedure
act
authorizes
suit
to
challenge
a
federal
agency
by
any
“person
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved
within
the
meaning
of
a
relevant
statute.”
we
have
held
that
this
language
establishes
a
regime
under
which
a
plaintiff
may
not
sue
unless
he
falls
within
the
zone
of
interests
sought
to
be
protected
by
the
statutory
provision
whose
violation
forms
the
legal
basis
for
his
complaint.
we
hold
that
the
term
“aggrieved”
in
title
vii
incorporates
this
test,
enabling
suit
by
any
plaintiff
with
an
interest
sought
to
be
protected
by
the
statute,
while
excluding
plaintiffs
who
might
technically
be
injured
in
an
article
iii
sense
but
whose
interests
are
unrelated
to
the
statutory
prohibitions
in
title
vii.
applying
that
test
here,
we
conclude
that
thompson
falls
within
the
zone
of
interests
protected
by
title
vii.
thompson
was
an
employee
of
nas,
and
the
purpose
of
title
vii
is
to
protect
employees
from
their
employers'
unlawful
actions.
moreover,
accepting
the
facts
as
alleged,
thompson
is
not
an
accidental
victim
of
the
retaliation
--
collateral
damage,
so
to
speak,
of
the
employer's
unlawful
act.
to
the
contrary,
injuring
him
was
the
employer's
intended
means
of
harming
regalado.
hurting
him
was
the
unlawful
act
by
which
the
employer
punished
her.
in
those
circumstances,
we
think
thompson
well
within
the
zone
of
interests
sought
to
be
protected
by
title
vii.
he
is
a
person
aggrieved
with
standing
to
sue.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
where
the
court
is
unanimous
except
for
justice
kagan
who
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
has
joined.
