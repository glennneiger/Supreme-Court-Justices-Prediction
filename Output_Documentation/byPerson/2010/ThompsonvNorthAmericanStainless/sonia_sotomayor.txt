but
the
fair
housing
act
has
a
definition
of
injury
that
would
include
mr.
thompson,
and
that's
not
in
this
act,
that
express
language.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
does
that
matter
under
your
theory?
let's
assume
the
different
--
slightly
different,
that
they're
just
coworkers,
but
a
coworker
who
has
expressed
sympathy
for
the
discriminated
person,
has
spoken
about
them
in
a
favorable
light,
or
has
tried
to
defend
them.
would
that
person
be
protected
from
being
fired--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
the
intent
was
to
retaliate
against
the
person
complaining
of
discrimination
by
getting
rid
of
their
friend
who's
supporting
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
an
opposer
is
anyone
who
--
who
assists?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
they
did
it
in
private,
but
the
employer
knew
it.
they
overheard
a
conversation
between
the
close
friend
and
the
employee
saying,
i
really
am
in
support
of
you;
i
know
you've
been
treated
unfairly.
i
like
you;
i
like
you
working
here.
would
that
person
be
close
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
--
if
regalado
had
sued
and
said
--
assume
the
fact;
i
know
that
you
claim
it
didn't
happen
--
they
fired
my
fiancee
to
retaliate
against
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
agree
with
your
adversary
that
she
wouldn't
have
article
iii
standing
to
seek
reinstatement
or
back
pay
for
her
fiancee?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
would
like
to
see
that
case
next--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
see
what
position
you
take
the
next
time.
are
you
willing
to
commit
your
company
to
that
position
today?
i
won't
do
that
to
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
why
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
why
not.
plaintiff
comes
in
and
says
i
engaged
in
protected
activity.
they--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
other
person
did.
they
retaliated
against
me.
how
do
you
--
then
the
employer
always
has
the
burden
to
come
forth
and
give
an
explanation
as
to
why?
what
would
be
--
the
prima
facie
case
generally
is
they
treated
me
differently
than
similarly
situated
people.
i
complained
at
a
time
close
to
my
firing;
there's
a
whole
series
of
prima
facie
elements.
