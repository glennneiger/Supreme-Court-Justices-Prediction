chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-291,
thompson
v.
north
american
stainless.
mr.
schnapper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understood
your
brief,
and
certainly
the
government's
brief,
to
take
a
very
expansive
view
of
what
type
of
retaliation
would
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
by
the
--
the
directly
harmed
employee.
now
you
seem
to
be
suggesting
that
that
employee
would
not
have
article
iii
standing
to
bring
an
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
this?
suppose
--
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you
say,
but
it
won't
be
because
of
the
degree
of
connection
between
the
--
the
retaliated-against
employee
and
the
means
of
retaliating.
i
understood
your
brief.
i'm
just
looking
at
page
6.
the
limitation
you
propose
is
someone
--
someone
close
to
him.
the
anti-retaliation
prohibition
prohibits
an
employer
from
firing
an
employee
because
someone
close
to
him
filed
an
eeoc
complaint.
and
i
guess
i
have
the
same
concern
that
we
have
been
discussing
for
a
little
while.
how
are
we
supposed
to
tell,
or
how
is
an
employer
supposed
to
tell,
whether
somebody
is
close
enough
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
burlington
northern,
of
course,
is
quite
different,
because
you're
just
--
you're
dealing
with
the
obvious
plaintiff
in
that
case.
you
--
your
--
your
concern
is
confined
to
a
particular
person.
in
this
hypothetical,
it's
an
unlimited
universe
that
you
don't
have
any
reason
to
know
where
it
ends.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
can't
they
talk
about
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
it's
not
like
you're
dealing
with
strangers.
that's
the
whole
point.
it's
someone
close
to
them.
i
--
on
the
one
hand
you're
saying,
well,
you
only
have
to
worry
about
people
really
close;
and
then
your
response
to
this
line
of
questioning
is,
well,
the
other
person
might
not
sue.
they're
going
to
sit
and
say,
"well,
you
sue".
"no,
you
sue".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that
a
problem?
you're
dealing
with
people
who
are
close.
they
assume
the
person
who
was
hurt
--
the
person
retaliated
against
would
sue.
well,
why
--
why
don't
they?
you
said
that
person
has
a
valid
suit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
are
lay
people.
they
don't
know
about
article
iii.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
kruger.
ms.
latherow.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
is
the
person
who
is
discriminated
against
in
the
hypothetical?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
his
point
was
that
"aggrieved"
includes
not
only
injury,
but
wrongfulness.
it
may
not
be
very
--
i
don't
know,
nice,
but
there's
nothing
wrongful
about
north
american
stainless
deciding
it's
not
going
to
fund
an
animal
shelter
because
of
some
other
reason.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
want
to
get
back
to
justice
breyer's
question?
i
don't
think
you
had
a
chance
to
respond
to
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
schnapper,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
happens
in
the
--
what
happens
in
the
animal
shelter
hypothetical
that
your
friend
proposed?
you
know,
the
north
american
stainless
--
or
--
funds
the
animal
shelter
of
--
that
--
where
the
wife
works,
and
they
cut
off
their
funding,
as
a
means
presumably
of--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
