because
you
start
with
somebody
who
is
unlike
the
shareholders,
there
is
no
title
vii
violation
as
to
them.
regalado
is
complaining
of
sex
discrimination,
and
then
she
said,
because
i
made
a
complaint,
they
retaliated
against
me.
the
shareholders
are
not
in
that
position,
because
there
was
no
initial
charge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what
do
you
do
with
the
argument
that
says
there's
a
middle
step?
you
can
--
you
have
the
sex
discrimination
complaint,
and
then
you
have
thompson,
who
is
aggrieved
in
the
sense
that
he
was
hurt,
he
was
injured.
but
they
say
there's
no
cause
of
action,
there's
no
statutory
cause
of
action,
for
thompson.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
taking
the
position
that
she
could
not
have
sued
in
retaliation?
it
would
be
awkward
because
he
is
--
it's
his
injury
that
requires
compensation,
but
are
you
saying
that
she
could
not
have
brought
a
retaliation
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
--
because
your
time
is
running
--
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
has
an
explicit
provision
that
allows
suits
by
adversely
affected
close
relatives.
you
are
essentially
asking
us
to
read
that
provision,
which
is
stated
expressly
in
the
ada--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
point
you
were
first
making,
i
thought,
was:
these
are
lay
people;
they
don't
have
a
lawyer;
they
would
naturally
think
that
the
person
who
was
hurt
would
be
the
one
to
sue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
eeoc
thinks
that
he's
the
right
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
go
back
to
--
first,
you
agree
that
it
is
unlawful
to
retaliate
against
a
person
who
filed
a
complaint
under
title
vii
by
dismissing
a
close
relative?
it
is
an
unlawful
employment
practice,
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
--
that's
not
an
altogether
novel
question,
but
it
has
come
up
under
some
other
statutes.
you
are
--
are
suggesting
that
this
is
carrying
the
--
the
person
aggrieved
to
new
heights,
but
we
have
both
the
nlrb
and
we
have
osha,
and
both
of
those
agencies
have
said
it,
that
to
take
adverse
action
against
a
close
relative
is
an
unfair
employment
practice,
and
they've
done
that
for
sometime,
have
they
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
a
100
percent
--
he
thought
there
might
be
an
article
iii
impediment.
but
in
--
in
your
brief
i
think
you
suggested
that
the
eeoc
doesn't
get
a
whole
lot
of
deference,
and
the
--
but
the
other
agencies
that
i
mentioned,
where
there
is
this
claim
that
can
be
brought
by
a
close
relative,
the
nlrb
gets
a
lot
of
deference,
the
department
of
labor
when
we're
dealing
with
occupational
safety
and
health
administration
or
the
mine
safety,
those
agencies
get
a
fair
degree
of
deference,
and
they
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is
a
--
an
interpretation
of
the
substantive
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
doesn't
have
to
do
with
the
evidence
in
a
particular
hearing.
can
a
person
who
is
a
close
relative
sue
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
injured,
deliberately
so,
in
order
to
retaliate
against
his
spouse
or
his
fiancee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schnapper,
in
the
point
you
are
making,
would
you
have
an
answer
to
the
--
this
point
that
was
made
about
the
burden
of
proof?
the
argument
was
that
you
wouldn't
have
mcdonnell
douglas
anymore
and
you
wouldn't
know
how
to
proceed
on
this
third-party
claim.
