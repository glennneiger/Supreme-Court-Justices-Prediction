ms.

latherow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
eric
thompson
does
not
allege
that
he
was
discriminated
against,
but
title
vii
is
a
discrimination
statute.
the
only
person
who
alleges
that
they
were
--
that
was--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--okay.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
i
don't
--
i
do
think
she
could
seek
reinstatement
to
get
general
equitable
relief
of
the
court.
in
terms
of
back
pay,
i
don't
see
why
she
couldn't
recover
that
for
him.
but
in
terms
of
his
coming
back
to
work--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
okay.
thank
you,
your
honor.
no
one
is
seeking
damages
for
ms.
regalado
in
this
case.
eric
thompson
is
here
to
use
her
rights
to
recover
for
her
alleged
discrimination
based
upon
her
conduct.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
i
agree
that
she
can
bring
the
cause
of
action
based
upon
burlington
and
the
way
that
the
language
is
written
in
burlington.
i
think
it's
very,
very
broad.
and
so
she
has
--
the
burlington
says
she
has
to
prove
injury,
that
retaliation
without
injury
is
not
actionable.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
no.
i
think
if
regalado
has
the
right
to
bring
a
cause
of
action,
it
is
going
to
be
very
difficult.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
but
i
think
that
the
way
that
burlington
reads
now,
and
that
is
whether
someone
would
be
dissuaded,
if
that
is
harm
to
her
then
she
could
bring
the
cause
of
action.
what's
difficult
about
applying
the
burlington
standard
is
you
could
have
someone
who
is
dissuaded
from
filing
a
claim,
but
may
not
be
harmed.
for
example,
if
an
employer
announced
a
proposition
that
it
was
going
to
fire
an
employee
at
random
whenever
someone
filed
an
eeoc
charge,
i
might
not
file
a
charge
because
i
wouldn't
want
someone,
even
someone
who
i
didn't
know,
to
be
terminated,
but
i
wouldn't
be
injured
in
that
scenario.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
i'm
sorry?
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
no,
i'm
not,
because
the
person
who
is
discriminated
against--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--it's
improper,
because
the
person
who
was
discriminated
against
would
have
the
right
to
sue.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
the
person
who
--
the
person
who
filed
the
eeoc
charge.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
what
makes
this
case
a
little
cloudy--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--they
cannot,
not
under
the
discrimination
provision
of
title
vii,
because
they
were
not
discriminated
against
based
upon
their
conduct.
it
wasn't
anything
that
they
did.
and
that's
what
burlington
northern
says,
that
the
anti-retaliation
provision
of
title
vii
seeks
to
prevent
harm
to
individuals
based
upon
what
they
do,
based
upon
their
conduct.
those
two
hypotheticals--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--she
may
not,
but
the
eeoc
could.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
in
which
case
she
wouldn't
have
been
injured,
so
she
would
have
no
claim.
if
you
think
about
it,
if
she
was
not
discriminated
against,
then
the
other
people
could
not
bring
a
claim
for
discrimination
based
upon
her.
what
makes
this
case
a
little
cloudy
is
that
eric
thompson
is
an
employee
as
well,
but
he
doesn't
bring
this
case
as
an
employee.
you
could
very
well
have
eric
thompson
as
a
spouse
who
is
not
employed.
so,
for
example,
if
mr.
thompson
had
been
just
--
let's
make
him
a
spouse,
an
even
closer
relationship
than
a
fiancee,
and
suppose
that
his
job
--
he
ran
an
animal
shelter
in
carrolton,
kentucky,
and
it
was
a
benevolent
organization,
but
his
only
source
of
revenue
was
a
generous
gift
from
north
american
stainless
at
christmastime.
and
in
2003,
after
regalado
filed
her
claim
with
the
eeoc,
filed
her
charge,
north
american
stainless
said,
i'm
not
going
to
give
money
this
year
to
the
animal
shelter,
to
mr.
thompson,
and
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
because
of
regalado,
who
is
our
employee,
because
she
filed
a
charge
of
discrimination.
i'm
not
going
to
do
anything
to
help
her.
i'm
not
going
to
do
anything
to
help
him.
in
that
case,
under
mr.
schnapper's
standard,
any
person
aggrieved
can
bring
a
claim.
that
person,
who
is
not
even
an
employee,
because
they
have
some
kind
of
injury,
could
bring
a
claim.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
but
it's
--
it's
treating
regalado
with
discrimination.
it
is
treating
her
differently
than
it
might
treat
another
employee
because
she
brought
the
cause
of
action.
that
would
be
discrimination
against
regalado
because
it's
treating
her
differently,
but
under
their
analysis--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--yes.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
i
believe
it
could
meet
the
standard
under
burlington,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
justice
breyer,
i
believe
your
question
was
the
scope,
and
what
does
this
term
"aggrieved"
mean?
and
in
the
sanders
case,
the
court
said
that
this
term
"aggrieved"
means
something
broad
and
it
is
intended
to
bring
a
lot
of
people
in.
but
that
case
was
interpreting
the
apa,
which
has
specific
language.
just
like
in
trafficante,
the
court
was
considering
the
fair
housing
act,
both
of
which
have
very
different
--
in
the
statute
in
question,
the
apa
says
a
person
suffering
a
legal
wrong
because
of
an
agency
action
or
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved
by
agency
action
within
a
meeting
of
a
relevant
statute
is
entitled
to
judicial
review,
and
that's
much
broader
than
what
we
have
in
this
case.
so
we
have
to
be
looking
at
whether
prudential
standing
rules
apply,
and
we
know
that
congress
legislates
against
that
prudential
standing.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
yes,
i
--
i
believe
it
should
be
read
into
title
vii,
because
that's
the
term
"aggrieved".
if
someone
--
if
my
husband
calls
and
says,
oh,
my
gosh,
we've
been
involved
in
a
car
accident,
i
don't
say:
honey,
are
you
aggrieved?
i
say:
honey,
are
you
injured?
that's
exactly
--
exactly
the
definition
of
"aggrieved"
in
the
fair
housing
act.
so
congress
recognized,
just
4
years
later,
after
title
vii
was
adopted,
when
it
enacted
the
fair
housing
act.
and
it
defined
"aggrieved",
and
said
aggrieved
means
or
includes
any
person
who
claims
to
have
been
injured.
that's
really--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--yes,
your
honor.
and
again,
we're
not
saying
that
discriminating
against
an
employee
in
taking
some
kind
of
action
against
someone
that
they
loved
is
not
an
unlawful
employment
action.
it
can
be.
that's
not
the
position
that
north
american
stainless
is
taking.
the
question
is,
is
the
person
who
was
not
discriminated
against,
the
person
who
was
injured
by
the
action,
can
they
bring
the
cause
of
action.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
and
title
vii--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
burlington
makes
clear
the
interest
to
be
protected
of
that
with
the
anti-retaliation
provision,
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
and
i'm
sorry,
and
your
question
is?
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
but,
your
honor,
respectfully,
there's
no
basis
in
the
statute
to
adopt
that
rule.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
i'm
glad--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--if
we
look
at
the
kinds
of
cases,
for
example,
the
trafficante
case,
and
the
other
cases
under
the
apa
where
congress
has
used
this
broad
language
or
has
interpreted
the
term
v.
spear,
the
environmental
species
act
or
the
blue
shield
of
virginia
case,
which
was
a
sherman
act
case,
the
injury
or
the
act,
the
violation
--
the
violation
in
those
cases
had
the
potential
to
--
to
inflict
harm
on
a
large
group
of
people.
so
that,
under
trafficante
there
were
over
8,000
people
who
lived
in
the
housing
complex.
under
bennett
v.
spear
with
the
environmental
species
act
there
was
more
than
one
person
who
was
adversely
affected
or
potentially
was
adversely
affected.
in
blue
cross--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--no,
my
point
is,
is
that
if
we're
looking
at
trying
to
compare
title
vii
and
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
impose
some
prudential
limitations
on
the
ago
aggrieved
language,
those
statutes
are
different
than
the
statutes
that
we
have--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--your
honor,
this
is
not
a
situation
like
calleleki,
where
the
court
is
trying
to
determine
on
something
about
a
procedure
within
the
eeoc,
and
that
is,
what
does
it
mean
for
a
charge,
because
you
need
some
kind
of
special
expertise.
here
the
court
is
the
expert
on
interpreting.
and
thompson
even
disagrees
with
the
eeoc.
the
eeoc
would
say
regalado
and
thompson
could
bring
the
claim,
but
thompson
disagrees
with
that.
so
it's
hard
for
thompson
to
come
and
say
let's
do
what
the
eeoc
says
when
he
disagrees
with
it
himself.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
i
--
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
and
in
this
--
this
--
i
don't
know,
but
i
believe
this
to
be
true
that,
for
example,
with
the
nlrb
and
with
osha,
they
have
their
own
administrative
agencies
where
there
would
be
hearings
within
those
agencies
versus
with
title
vii,
the
eeoc
does
not
--
they're
not
a
determiner--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
know
the
distinction
between
relying
on
those
--
those
agencies
versus
the
eeoc,
but
i
do
know
that
in
the
burlington
court,
this
court
noted
that
the
eeoc
compliance
manual
--
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
is
the
compliance
manual,
we're
not
talking
about
a
regulation,
we're
not
talking
something
else,
but
a
compliance
manual.
so
in
your
hypothetical
i
don't
know
if
we're
talking
about
a
compliance
manual
from
the
nlrb
or
osha,
but
this
is
a
compliance
manual.
and
in
burlington,
this
court
noted
there
were
inconsistencies
regarding
the
anti-retaliation
within
the
compliance
manual
as
to
what
an
adverse
action
meant
or
what
would
constitute
an
adverse
action.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
i
don't
know--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--yes,
they
can.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
no.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
your
honor,
the
concerns
from
the
employment
side
in
this
case
are
substantial.
under
thompson's
theory
of
the
case,
anyone
who
is
injured
or
what
he
says
is
aggrieved,
anyone
who
receives
injury
becomes
a
protected
party.
it's
not
just
bringing
the
lawsuit,
but
it's
the
protected
party.
he's
not
even
a
silent
opposer
in
this
case.
there
were
--
there
were
concerns
in
crawford
about
the
silent
opposer
and
how
do
we
know
who
they
are.
he
says
it's
based
solely
upon
his
relationship.
he
has
engaged
in
no
protected
conduct.
the
silent
opposer,
assuming
they
can
have
--
bring
a
claim,
at
least
engaged
in
some
conduct,
but
thompson
has
no
protection
under
this
statute.
he
could
have
very
easily
gotten
the
protection.
in
our
joint
appendix
we
submitted
the
brief
that
eric
--
or
the
memo
that
eric
thompson
submitted
to
his
supervisor
just
shortly
before
he
was
terminated.
he
complains
in
that
memo
about
his
compensation,
and
this
is
on
page
22
and
23
of
the
joint
appendix.
he
says--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--the
joint
appendix.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
he
says
in
this
memo:
i
am
disappointed
in
compensation
this
year.
at
the
time
that
he
submitted
this
memo
to
his
supervisor,
his
fiancee
had
a
complaint
or
a
charge
with
the
eeoc
pending.
if
he
had
only
come
forward
in
this
memo,
congress
says
you
would
have
gotten
protection;
if
he
had
come
forward
and
said,
by
the
way,
i
think
the
way
you
treat
my
wife
is
discriminatory,
he
would
have
gotten
protection.
the
--
the
means
by
which
employees
get
protection
under
the
statute
are
not
very
difficult.
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
come
forward
and
oppose.
thompson
clearly
had
an
avenue
and
a
means
to
do
that
because
he
was
taking
--
he
was
action
on
his
own
behalf
to
complain.
so
thompson
wants
to
bring
a
claim
under
--
for
regalado,
but
he
couldn't
at
that
time
come
forward
and
step
up
to
the
plate
and
say
to
the
employer,
"hey,
i
have
a
problem
with
this.
"
but
yet
he
wants
to
come
into
court
and
to
claim
his
right
--
or
to
claim
her
rights
as
a
basis
to
bring
this
suit.
according
to
the
eeoc
statistics,
in
1992,
when
data
first
began
being
collected,
14.5
percent
of
charges
filed
with
the
eeoc
were
retaliation
claims.
by
2009
that
had
risen
by
31
percent.
in
the
chamber's
brief
on
page
2,
they
submit
or
recite
to
a
study
that
was
published
in
1994
saying
that
the
average
cost
to
defend
an
employment
litigation
in
1994,
when
the
study
was
published,
was
$120,000.
in
this
case
what
thompson
would
propose
is
to
give
protected
party
to
a
wide
range
of
people;
and
with
respect
to
the
government's
position
today,
at
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
they
advocated
that
there
would
be
no
limitation,
that
everyone
would
get
the
protection.
that's
a
broad
--
that
is
a
lot
of
protection
for
people,
and
i
can
tell
you
that
employers
who
are
faced
with
someone
in
a
protected
party,
they
are
--
employers
are
reluctant
to
take
adverse
decisions
against
them;
they're
reluctant
to
implement
discipline;
they
will
postpone
implementing
that
decision
because
they
know
at
some
point
they're
going
to
have
to
establish
a
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reason.
when
we
--
when
we
point
out
--
when
we
point
this
out
in
our
arguments,
the
response
by
eric
thompson
as
--
as
to
who
gets
the
protection,
it's
in
his
footnote
on
page
4
at
his
reply,
he
says
that
the
identity
of
individuals
who
might
have
a
claim
is
a
function
of
the
employer's
own
intent.
so,
in
other
words,
in
order
to
determine
whether
someone
has
protection,
you
have
to
look
at
the
employer's
intent.
so
there
are
no
protected
parties
anymore
until
the
employer
can
establish
that
they
had
no
intent
--
or
the
other
way.
everyone
is
protected
party
until
the
employer
can
show
that
he
had
no
intent.
so
what
that
means
at
the
trial
is
that
there
will
never
be--
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
--but
the
position
that's
set
forward
by
thompson
is
you
determine
whether
someone
is
a
protected
party
by
looking
at
the
intent
of
the
employer.
ms.
leigh
gross
latherow
that's
true
at
trial,
though,
after
a
plaintiff
gets
past
his
initial
burden
of
proof,
and
in
this
case
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
be
able
to
establish
their
burden
of
proof
solely
by
saying
that
they
were
a
protected
party
and
there
was
intent
on
the
other
side.
that
is
going
to
shift
the
burden
to
the
employer
at
the
outset
of
the
case
to
prove
that
there
was
no
retaliation,
that
there
was
no
intent.
your
honor,
in
conclusion,
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
the
sixth
circuit
determined
that
eric
thompson
who
was
not
discriminated
against
had
no
protection
under
the
statute.
this
court
clearly
held
in
burlington
that
the
anti-retaliation
provision
of
title
vii
is
designed
to
protect
employees
based
upon
what
they
do,
based
upon
their
conduct.
in
this
case
eric
thompson
engaged
in
none
of
that
behavior,
he
had
no
conduct,
he
did
not
come
forward
on
behalf
of
anyone;
yet
he
is
here
asking
for
remedies,
remedies
that
really
should
belong
to
regalado.
there
is
no
reason
that
regalado
could
not
have
brought
this
case.
there
--
if
the
concern
is
that
employers
are
going
to
discriminate
against
employees,
the
response
to
that
is
that
employers
will
still
be
held
liable
and
can
still
be
held
liable,
and
that
is
by
the
person
who
is
discriminated
against
from
bringing
the
suit.
we
ask
that
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
be
affirmed.
