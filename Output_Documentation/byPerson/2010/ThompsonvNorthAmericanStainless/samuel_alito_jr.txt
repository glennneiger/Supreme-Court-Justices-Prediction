the
question
is
whether
he's
aggrieved
within
the
meaning
of
title
vii.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
your
argument
is
that
if
there
is
injury,
in
fact,
sufficient
to
satisfy
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
then
the
person
is
aggrieved.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
your
argument
that
we
have
--
that
we
should
go
that
far?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
don't
need
to
go
that
far?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
do
we
draw
the
line?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
does
that
come
from?
where
does
that
test
come
from?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
the
argument.
i
don't
really
--
it's
not
too
helpful,
at
least
to
me,
to
say,
as
far
as
we
need
to
go
in
order
to
reverse.
that's
really
not
how
the
statute
ought
to
be
interpreted,
i
would
say.
what
does
it
mean?
now,
i
understand
the
argument
that
"aggrieved"
means
all
the
way
to
what's
--
all
that's
necessary
is
what
is
necessary
to
satisfy
the
constitution.
and
i
understand
that
argument.
it's
a
very
broad
argument
with
a
lot
of
implications.
but
if
that's
not
correct,
then
what
is
the
correct
test
and
where
does
it
come
from?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
thompson
were
not
regalado's
fiancee
at
the
time.
suppose
they
were
just
--
they
were
just
good
friends.
would
--
and
everything
else
happened,
and
he
alleged
that
he
was
fired
in
retaliation
for
her
engaging
in
protected
conduct.
the
way
the
company
wanted
to
get
at
her
was
by
firing
her
friend.
would
that
be
enough?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
does
that
translate?
how
does
that
burlington
northern
standard
translate
into
this
situation
in
which
there
is
some
sort
of
relationship
between
the
--
the
person
who
engaged
in
the
protected
conduct
and
the
person
who
suffers
the
adverse
employment
action?
that's
what's
troubling
to
me
about
--
about
the
theory.
where
it's
a
fiancee,
it's
--
that's
a
relatively
strong
case,
but
i
can
imagine
a
whole
spectrum
of
cases
in
which
there
is
a
lesser
relationship
between
those
two
persons,
and
if
--
if
--
if
--
unless
there's
a
clear
line
there
someplace,
this
theory
is
rather
troubling.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
you
help
--
can
you
help
provide
where
the
clear
line
is?
does
it
go
--
does
it
include
simply
a
good
friend?
does
it
include
somebody
who
just
has
lunch
in
the
cafeteria
every
day
with
the
person
who
engaged
in
the
protected
conduct?
somebody
who
once
dated
the
person
who
engaged
in
the
protected
conduct?
are
these
all
questions
that
have
to
go
to
a
jury?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
put
yourself
in
the
--
in
the
shoes
of
an
employer,
and
you
--
you
think
--
you
want
to
take
an
adverse
employment
action
against
employee
a.
you
think
you
have
good
grounds
for
doing
that,
but
you
want
--
before
you
do
it,
you
want
to
know
whether
you're
potentially
opening
yourself
up
to
a
retaliation
claim.
now,
what
is
the
employer
supposed
to
do
then?
they
say,
well,
let's
--
we
need
to
survey
everybody
who
is
engaged
in
protected
conduct,
and
now
we
need
to
see
whether
this
person
who
we're
thinking
of
taking
the
adverse
employment
action
against
has
a,
quote,
unquote,
"close
relationship"
with
any
of
those
people.
so
what
do
you
do?
do
you
call
everybody
in
from
the
company
and
you
say,
now,
is
--
you
know,
was
--
are
these
people
dating?
did
they
once
date?
are
they
good
friends?
what
are
you
supposed
to
do?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
that.
i
do
understand
that,
but
i
wish
you
--
i
would
like
you
to
answer
my
question.
does
the
employer
have
to
keep
a
--
a
journal
on
the
intimate
or
casual
relationships
between
all
of
its
employees,
so
that
it
knows
what
it's
--
it's
opening
itself
up
to
when
it
wants
to
take
an
action
against
someone?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you're
--
you're
a
reasonable
person.
what
would
you
say
is
the
degree
of
closeness
that
is
required?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
very
good
friends
is
enough?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
someone
in
thompson's
position
filed
a
charge
with
the
eeoc,
couldn't
the
eeoc
tell
him,
you're
the
wrong
person
to
sue?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
rule
is
that
--
if
the
rule
is
otherwise,
why
couldn't
they
provide
advice?
