could
she
have
gotten
reinstatement
on
the
grounds
that
his
continuing
inability
to
be
employed
by
the
company
is
an
ongoing
hurt
to
her?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
an
employer
dismisses
an
employee
on
an
impermissible
ground,
impermissible
under
title
vii,
and
is
a
very
valuable
employee.
can
the
shareholders
sue
on
the
ground
that
the
shareholder
is
now
injured
because
the
company
is
worth
less,
having
lost
this
employee,
under
title
vii?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
it's
the
same
hypothetical.
regalado,
all
the
same
facts,
except
she
is
very
valuable
to
the
company.
the
company
is
now
worth
less;
shareholder
sues.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
--
in
your
view,
could
regalado
have
brought
this
suit,
or
brought
a
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
that
is
so,
why
doesn't
that
vindicate
the
purposes
of
the
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
--
i
assume
that
part
of
the
thrust
of
your
argument
is
that
this
was
designed
to
hurt
this
--
regalado,
that
she
was
hurt,
that
this
was
injurious;
then
you
say,
oh,
well,
it's
not
important
enough
for
her
to
sue.
so
someone
that
is
more
remote
can
sue.
that's
an
odd
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
saying
an
employer
could
adopt
that
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
an
employer
could
adopt
that
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
an
employer
says,
now,
if
anybody
makes
a
discrimination
claim,
we're
going
to
fire
two
other
employees
just
to
show
you
that
we
run
an
efficient
corporation
here,
you
say
that
that
is
proper
or
improper?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
persons,
the
two
people
in
the
hypothetical
that
are
fired
can't
sue?
