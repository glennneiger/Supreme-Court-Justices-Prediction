ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
an
employer
fires
an
employee
as
a
means
of
retaliating
against
a
relative
or
close
associate
who
has
filed
an
eeoc
charge,
the
employee
who
has
been
fired
is
entitled
under
title
vii
to
go
to
court
and
seek
appropriate
remedies,
even
if
he
hasn't
himself
engaged
in
protected
activity.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
justice
alito,
we
are
not
arguing
for
a
test
that
would
create
a
kind
of
protection
for
a
so-called
right
of
association
under
title
vii.
it's
not
the
case
that
so
long
as
somebody
is
associated
with
somebody
who
has
complained
about
discrimination
they
would
be
automatically
protected
under
the
test
that
we're
advocating.
the
reason
the
relationship
is
important
in
this
case
is
because
it
tends
to
render
plausible
the
argument
that
there's
a
causal
connection
between
the
adverse
action
visited
on
thompson
in
this
case--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--no,
i
think
it's
actually
quite
the
contrary.
i
think
if
the
employer
doesn't
know
about
the
relationship,
any
allegation
like
the
allegation
we
have
in
this
case
simply
isn't
going
to
be
plausible.
it
isn't
going
to
be
a
plausible
contention
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
one
employee's
protected
activity
and
an
adverse
action
visited
on
the
plaintiff.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
if
there's
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
for
the
court
to
try
to
fashion
a
hard
and
fast
rule
that
identifies
some
relationships
that
are
close
enough
and
others
that
aren't.
the
question
in
every
case
is
the
question
that's
posed
by
this
court's
standard
in
burlington
northern:
was
this
an
action
that
a
reasonable
employee
would
have
considered
materially
adverse?
would
it
have
been
deterred--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
it's
certainly
going
to
be
important
whenever
a
plaintiff
brings
a
suit
like
this
both
to
establish
that
the
employer
knew
of
the
relationship
and
the
relationship
was
one
that
is
of
sufficient
closeness
that
a
reasonable
employee
might
be
deterred
from
making
or--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--in
that
scenario,
i
think
that
that
person
would
have
a
cause
of
action,
but
for
a
different
reason.
under
this
court's
decision
in
crawford,
that
person
would
probably
be
considered
to
be
a
person
who
had
opposed
the
discrimination,
and
for
that
reason
would
themselves
have
engaged
in
a
protected
activity.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
our
understanding
of
what
this
court
held
in
--
in
the
crawford
case.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that
--
again,
i
think
it's
a
question
that
sort
of
turns
on
whether
a
jury
would
find
that
a
reasonable
employee
in
the
position
of
the
person
who
had
engaged
in
protected
activity
would
be
deterred
from
making
or
supporting
a
charge
of
discrimination
if
they
knew
the
consequence
was
that
their
best
friend
would
be
fired.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
think
that
it
would
be
an
essentially
arbitrary
rule.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
at
end
of
the
day,
the
question
is
just
the
question
that
the
court
assigns
under
burlington
northern.
it's
a
question
that
turns
on
the
specific
facts
and
context
of
the
--
a
specific
case.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think,
in
defense
of
the
court--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
an
employer
always
is
going
to
have
to
be
careful
to
some
degree
not
to
visit
harm
on
an
employee
for
retaliatory
reasons.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
way
to
fashion
a
hard
and
fast
rule.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
most
of
the
cases
that
have
arisen
that
have
raised
third-party
retaliation
arguments,
which
are
indeed
cognizable
under
a
number
of
--
of
employment
statutes,
and
i
don't
think
respondent
disputes
that
they
are
rightly
so
--
have
largely
concerned
relationships
like
the
relationship
between
parent
and
child,
between
husband
and
wife.
in
one
case
under
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
it's
involved
a
relationship
between
very
good
friends
in
the
workplace,
whereas
there
is
a
d.c.
court
of
appeals
decision
that
holds
that
a
merely
professional
relationship
that
doesn't
exhibit
that
degree
of
personal
affection
isn't
sufficiently
close.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that
a
reasonable
employee
who
knows
that
the
consequence
of
making
or
supporting
a
charge
of
discrimination
is
going
to
be
that
their
best
friend
at
work
is
going
to
be
fired
may
be
deterred
from
engaging
in
protected
activity.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
yes,
justice
kennedy,
we
do
think
that
regalado
could
have
brought
a
suit
in
her
own
right,
because
she,
too,
is
a
person
aggrieved
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
for
two
reasons,
justice
kennedy.
first
of
all,
regalado
here
didn't
sue,
just
like
most
people
in
her
position
didn't
sue,
because
mostly
people
who
are
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
title
vii
--
as
the
private
attorney
generals
--
under
the
statutory
scheme
will
assume
that
the
person
who
lost
their
job--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
i
think
in
that
situation,
that
she
certainly
--
she
might
sue,
but
she
also
might
assume
it
ought
to
be
her
fiancee
whose
job
was
actually
lost
who
ought
to
carry--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--they
might--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
the
fact
that
they
were
close
at
the
time
of
the
retaliatory
act
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
they
might
still
be
close
at
the
time
that
they
need
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
press
charges.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
the
other--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--they
may
not
be
close
by
the
time--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
that
is
certainly
one
point.
but
i
think
even
if
they
were
perfectly
informed
and
the
rule
that
this
court
announced
was
one
that
put
regalado
in
the
driver's
seat
entirely
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
to
pursue
the
cause
of
action
under
title
vii,
there
would
still
be
a
problem
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
she
could
seek
full
relief,
the
relief
that's
necessary
to
make
him
whole.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
it
conceivably
could,
but
that
is--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
the
eeoc
certainly
does
think
he's
the
right
person.
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
the
eeoc's
wrong--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--the
eeoc
is
ordinarily
not
in
the
business
of
advising
people
who
filed
charges
with
respect
to
charges
that
other
people
might
file,
for
confidentiality
reasons,
among
other
reasons.
