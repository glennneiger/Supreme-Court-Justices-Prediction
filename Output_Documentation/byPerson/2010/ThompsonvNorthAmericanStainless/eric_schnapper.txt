mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
704(a),
title
vii,
prohibits
the
use
of
third
party
reprisals
as
a
method
of
retaliating
against
a
person
who
complained
to
the
eeoc
or
otherwise
opposed
discrimination.
the
text
of
section
704(a)
doesn't
limit
the
types
of
retaliation
which
are
forbidden.
the
elements
of
the
statute
are
unrelated
to
that.
the
first
requirement
is
that
the
plaintiff
show
that
discrimination
occurred
with
regards
to
the
individual
who
engaged
in
a
protected
activity.
in
a
case
like
that,
like
this,
that's
shown
by
--
would
be
shown
by
evidence
that
they
singled
out
ms.
regalado
and
ms.
regalado's
fiancee.
they
didn't
go
fire
anybody
else's
fiancee.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
this
particular
action
was
taken.
secondly,
the
plaintiff
must
show
that
the
conduct
was
discrimination
against
the
person
who
engaged
in
protected
activity.
that
language
is
easily
applicable
to
a
situation
where
you
single
out,
say,
a
family
member
or
a
fiancee.
the
purpose
of
that,
the
complaint
can
fairly
be
read
to
allege,
was
to
punish
the
person
who
had
engaged
in
protected
activity.
there
are
a
number
of
federal
statutes
that
use
the
word
"against"
in
precisely
this
way.
they
say
that
actions
cannot
be
taken
to
--
say,
against
a
family
member
of
a
sitting
judge
or
other
federal
official
where
the
purpose
is
to
act
against
the
official.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i'm
sorry.
is
she
still
engaged?
mr.
eric
schnapper
they're
married.
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
they
have
a
lovely
2-year-old
daughter.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think,
your
honor,
that
this
court's
article
iii
jurisprudence
would
have
precluded
her
from
getting
any
remedy.
the
--
certainly
most
of
the
remedies
that
are
needed
here,
she
wouldn't
have
had
article
iii
standing
to
win
an
award
of
back
pay
to
her
now
husband.
she
couldn't
have
gotten
awarded
damages
to
him.
i
think--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--perhaps.
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
in
this
particular
case,
almost
certainly
not,
because
of
just
the
course
of
subsequent
events.
but
she
subsequently
left
the
company.
at
this
point,
they
live
nowhere
near
that.
it
wouldn't
work.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
so.
but
the
situation
here
is
different
than
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
the
thrust
of
your
question
was
--
is:
are
the
shareholders
like
thompson?
and
i
think
that
thompson's
situation
is
quite
different.
he
was
the
very
target
of
the
illegal
act.
the
illegality
occurs
only
by
means
of
dismissing
him.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
is
the
other
question.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
court's
decision
in
trafficante
goes
that
far,
and
in
practice
it
has
not
proved
a
problem
under
title
viii.
that's
generally
been
its
understanding
here.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
do
not--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--you
don't
need
to
go
that
far.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
the
government
--
i
think
as
far
as
you
need
to
go,
which
is
not
the
same
as
saying,
that's
as
far
as
the
law
goes,
is
the
standard
articulated
by
the
government,
as
in
mccready,
where
the
action
against
thompson
was
the
very
method
by
which
the
law
was
violated;
that
that
would
satisfy
the
requirement
of
person
aggrieved.
mr.
eric
schnapper
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
think
that's
as
far
as
you
need
to
go
in
this
case.
i
think
the
standard
of
aggrieved
is
broader
than
that,
but
the
--
as
this
has
played
out
in
the
lower
courts
since
trafficante,
there's
a
wide
range
of
different
kinds
of
circumstances
under
which
the
trafficante
rule
has
been
invoked
in
title
vii
cases.
we're
not
asking
you
to
address
all
of
those.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
two
other
limitations
that
would
be
applicable
here,
as
indeed
they
would
have
be
under
title
viii.
first
one
is
proximate
cause,
which
will
cut
off
a
lot
of
injuries
down
the
road.
and
title
vii
is
adopted
against
a
background
of
proximate
cause
rules,
and
there,
i
don't
think
--
we
don't
contend
that
in
using
the
word
"person
aggrieved"
they
meant
--
congress
meant
to
set
those
aside.
secondly,
the
--
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
word
"aggrieved"
is
that
it
is
--
"aggrieved"
is
both,
in
ordinary
english,
frankly,
broader
and
narrower
than
"injured".
it
is
broader
--
and
that's,
of
course,
not
your
concern
--
in
the
sense
that
it
covers
people
who
haven't
been
injured
yet
but
might
be
injured
in
the
future.
but
it
also
has
a
second
element,
which
is
that
the
action
at
issue
involves
some
sort
of
a
wrong.
if
someone
deliberately
knocks
me
down,
i'm
injured,
i'm
probably
aggrieved,
but
not
if
i'm
carrying
a
football
in
the
middle
of
a
football
game.
that's
a
legitimate
thing
to
do.
so
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
wrong,
and
the
wrong
has
to
be
the
basis
of
the
plaintiff's
objection.
you
could
have
a
situation
where
the
plaintiff
really
didn't
care
one
way
or
another
why
that
harm
had
happened.
it
was
--
but
in
this
case,
that's
precisely
why
thompson
complains.
he's
not
suggesting
that
he
would
be
wronged
if
he
were
ever
fired
at
all.
he
is
aggrieved
because
he
was
fired
for
a
reason
that
was
an
improper
reason,
and
we
think
those
are
--
those
are--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
the
--
we
think
that's
just
clearly
wrong.
the
statute
provides
a
cause
of
action.
if
i
might
go
back
to
how
that
came
up
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
appears
to
have
assumed
that
third-party
reprisals
are
unlawful.
that's
not
entirely
clear.
then
in
footnote
1,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
thompson
was
aggrieved.
notwithstanding
that,
they
then
went
on
to
say
that
--
there's
no
cause
of
action
in
the
statute,
they
said
in
section
704(a).
that
really
doesn't
make
any
sense.
the
--
the
statute
provides
an
express
cause
of
action
that
says
that
individuals
--
certain
individuals,
if
the
requirements
are
met,
can
bring
lawsuits.
so
the
question
is,
as
--
as
justice
alito
put
it
and
--
and
was
put
before,
which
is
whether
the
plaintiff
is
aggrieved.
but
if
he's
aggrieved,
he's
clearly
got
a
cause
of
action--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
the
--
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
prove
two
things.
first
of
all,
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
prove
that
that
was
indeed
the
company's
motive
for
picking
him
to
fire
him.
secondly,
under
this
court's
decision
in
burlington
northern,
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
show
that
this
is
a
retaliatory
action
sufficiently
serious
that
it
was
--
it
would
likely
persuade
a
reasonable
employee
in
regalado's
position
to
dissuade
her
complaint.
and
--
and
that's
why
we've
agreed
with
the
respondents'
contention
that
--
that
they're
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
determination
about
whether
that
standard
was
met
here.
so
that's
an
important
limiting
principle,
and
it
has--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
i
think--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--they
wouldn't
all
have
to
go
to
a
jury.
i
mean,
the
--
the
problem,
as
you
cast
it,
is
that
the
standard
in
burlington
northern,
no
offense,
isn't
a
bright
line.
it
is
the
standard,
which
it
is.
and
the
same
question
could
arise
about
other
methods
of
retaliation.
what
about
--
what
about
cutting
someone
out
of
five
meetings
or
ten
meetings?
that
same
problem
exists
under
burlington
northern
no
matter
what.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
that
that
kind
of
remedy
would
pose
very
serious
problems
under
article
iii.
mr.
eric
schnapper
because
money
isn't
going
to
her.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
is
of
some
--
some
importance
here.
i
mean,
it
--
it
--
the
--
ordinarily,
article
iii
would
bar
me
from
suing
for
an
award
of
money
to
be
paid
to
somebody
else.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
as
--
as
i
say,
i
think
--
i
think
article
iii
would
be
--
would
be
a
major
obstacle
there.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
we've
got
a
situation
here
in
which
this
violates
the
rights
of
regalado,
but
regalado's
ability
to
herself
bring
a
lawsuit
and
get
a
remedy
is
limited,
and
that
--
that--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--it's
possible
she
could
bring
a
suit.
the
question
would
be
whether
she
had
article
iii
standing
to
seek
the
remedy
that
she
was
then
seeking,
which
would
often
be
a
problem.
mr.
eric
schnapper
if
i
might
respond
to
that
briefly,
you're
referring
to
section
12112(b)(4)
of
the
ada.
that
is
a
provision
directed
at
a
very
different
problem,
which
is
not
associations
between
employees.
it's
--
it's
directed
at
employers
who
might
refuse
to
hire
a
worker
because,
for
example,
he
had
or
she
had
a
child
with
a
disability.
the
eeoc's
commentaries
on
the
regs
about
this
explain
it.
it
is
--
it
is
not
concerned
with
employee
relations.
it
is
concerned
with
a
discrimination
against
a
worker
--
prospective
worker,
typically
--
because
they
have
a
family
member
who
has
a
disability,
and
the
employer
has
preconceptions
about
whether
they
will
be
good
workers
based
on
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
--
that
statute
was
adopted
somewhat
later.
there
are
large
numbers
of
statutes
that
have
a
general
language
like
"person
aggrieved".
but
i
think
that
in
the
case,
of
the
housing
act,
that
language
fairly
describes
the
ordinary
english
meaning
of
"aggrieved".
sometimes
congress
does
that.
there
are
other
definitions
in
the
fair
housing
act
like
that
--
like
the
definition
of
"dwelling".
it
doesn't
mean
u.s.
code.
congress
in
that
instance
decided
to
spell
out
what
everyone,
i
think,
understood
what
the
word
would
have
meant.
mr.
eric
schnapper
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
just
have
a
couple
quick
points.
mr.
eric
schnapper
your
honor,
mcdonnell
douglas
--
the
particular
formula
in
mcdonnell
douglas
was
for
hiring
cases.
the
courts
have
readily
adapted
it
to
other
kind
of
cases
where,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
claim,
the
plaintiff
produces
some
minimal
amount
of
information
and
the
employer
is
required
to
--
to
articulate
a
reason,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
problem
here.
getting
back
to
the
question
that
was
asked
at
the--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--what?
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
probably
--
the
other
person
did.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
there
has
to
be
--
right.
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
that
could
plausibly
give
rise
to
--
to
an
inference
of
motive.
even
if
i
were
complaining
that
i
was
retaliated
against,
i
can't
just
come
in
and
say
i
engaged
in
protected
activity
and
was
fired.
i
would
need
more
than
that.
so
you
would
need
that
additional
amount
here,
plus
you
would
also
have
to
have
some
evidence
to
give
rise
to
an
inference
that
this
third
party
was
selected
as
a
victim.
so
it
wouldn't
--
you
could
--
you
could
adapt
it.
but
getting
back
to
what
was
asked
earlier,
there's
no
question
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff
at
all
times
to
establish
motive;
and
as
we
get
particularly
far
afield
from
family
members,
someone
closely
associated
with
the
plaintiff,
it
is
going
to
be
difficult
to
--
to
establish,
to
meet
that
burden.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
burlington
northern
makes
it
clear
that
the
plaintiff
wouldn't
have
to
be
an
employee.
in
that
case
one
of
the
questions
was
could
you
retaliate
against
an
fbi
agent
by
not
protecting
his
wife
from
being
murdered?
i
think
that
would
be
a
pretty
good
way
to
--
to
keep
people
from
complaining.
but
i
think
the
burlington
northern
limitation
would
--
you
know,
would
have
some
traction
in
these
cases.
the
animal
shelter
seems
unlikely.
but
the
burden
of
proof
is
there.
as
the
--
as
the
relationship
becomes
more
attenuated,
once
you
get
past
family
members,
i
think
it's
going
to
be
difficult,
even
at
summary
judgment
for
these
cases
to
survive.
and--
