justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
can't
--
why
can't
they
get
--
the
first
question,
to
go
back,
is
a
confusion
in
my
mind:
why
couldn't
she
bring
this
suit?
and
she
says,
i
was
discriminated
against
because
they
did
a,
b,
c,
d
to
him,
and
the
remedy
is,
cure
the
way
in
which
i
was
discriminated
against.
and
to
cure
that
way,
you
would
have
to
make
the
man
whole
in
respect
to
those
elements
that
we're
discriminating
against.
do
you
give
him
back
pay?
do
you
restore
him?
you
do
everything
you
would
normally
have
to
do
because
otherwise,
she
is
suffering
the
kind
of
injury,
though
it
was
to
him,
that
amounts
to
discrimination
for
opposing
a
practice.
what's
wrong
with
that
theory?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what?
she's
hurt.
suppose
it
was
a
child
that
they
--
what
they
--
or
suppose
they
robbed
--
they
robbed
the
--
the
judge's
wife
in
order
to
get
him
to
do
something?
and
--
and
that's
a
crime,
and
suppose
there
was
a
civil
statute.
the
judge
says:
the
way
you
cure
what
you
did
to
get
me
to
do
something
is
you
make
me
whole.
and
in
that
instance,
it
requires
making
her
whole.
what's
the
article
iii
problem?
well,
anyway
--
this
is
crucial,
but
i'm
--
i'm
--
i'm
just
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that's
because
the
award
of
money
to
be
paid
for
somebody
else,
their
absence
of
money,
didn't
hurt
you,
but
where
there
--
for
example,
if
you're
a
trustee,
you
certainly
can
sue
to
get
the
beneficiary
put
back.
there
are
dozens
of
cases
where
you
can
sue
to
get
somebody
else
paid
back
money,
and
--
and
why
isn't
this
one
of
them?
but
anyway,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
want
to
pursue
it
beyond
a
quick
answer,
because
there
are
other
things
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
couldn't
win
on
that
under
burlington.
i
think
that
there
are
three
separate
issues
here
that
have
to
be
kept
straight.
no
one
can
win
in
court
unless
they
show
there
was
a
human
being
--
in
this
case,
the
woman
--
who
suffered
material
--
who
suffered
serious
harm,
serious
harm.
and
serious
harm
is
defined
as
materially
adverse
action
which
might
well
have
dissuaded
a
reasonable
worker
from
making
or
supporting
a
charge
of
discrimination.
so
unless
she
suffered
that
kind
of
serious
harm,
nobody
wins.
then
the
next
question
is
suppose
in
the
course
of
that,
somebody
else
was
hurt.
and
the
person
aggrieved
provision
suggests
because
of
the
history
of
the
word
"aggrieved"
that
more
than
just
she
can
bring
the
lawsuit.
that's
our
first
question.
and
then
our
third
question
is,
if
the
second
question
is
yes,
why
can't
the
whole
world
do
it?
at
least
the
barber
who
doesn't
get
the
haircut
anymore
because
the
person
fired
doesn't
have
any
money
or
the
landlord
who
can't
get
his
rent
or
the
--
you
know,
we
can
go
on
indefinitely.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
don't
we
get
to
the
second
question?
the
second
question
is
--
the
word
"aggrieved"
has
a
history.
i
think
it
comes
out
of
--
what's
the
case?
i
think
it
comes
out
of
fcc
v.
sanders
brothers,
which
is
a
1940
case,
which
said
that
sometimes
where
there's
a
statute
using
the
word
"person
aggrieved",
that
that
means
that
a
person
can
bring
a
lawsuit
even
though
that
person
does
not
suffer
injury
of
the
type
that
the
statute
was
meant
to
prevent
against.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
picked
up
by
the
apa.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
"person
aggrieved".
so
we
have
a
statute
that
says
"person
aggrieved".
maybe
it
means
it
in
a
different
sense
or
maybe
it
means
it
in
the
apa
sense,
sanders
brothers
sense,
which
means
in
principle,
this
plaintiff
can
sue.
you
can
argue
against
that
if
you
want,
but,
i
mean,
that's
where
i'm
starting
from.
and
then
we
can
have
the
third
part,
which
is:
is
there
a
way
of
limiting
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
to
--
i'm
just
asking
a
question,
quite
a
long
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't,
but
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
do
that,
because
it's
in
black
and
white
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
--
that's
why
this
is
--
see,
what
sanders
brothers
did
is
the
interest
to
be
protected
against
had
nothing
to
do
with
protecting
competitors
from
competition.
the
court
says
that.
and
it
says
but
here
is
a
competitor
trying
to
protect
himself
from
competition,
can
he
bring
a
suit?
well,
normally
not.
but
congress
used
the
word
"person
aggrieved"
or
"adversely
affected",
and
therefore
they
can.
now,
that's
the
precedent
that's
--
that's
--
that's
harmful
to
you.
i'm
not
certain.
what
about
the
third
part?
i
have
a
suggestion,
and
i
would
like
your
response,
because
i'm
just
playing
with
the
thought.
that
the
way
to
limit
this
is
to
say
that
where
a
person
is
being
used,
a
person
b
is
hurt
because
in
order
to
retaliate
against
person
a,
okay?
that
that
is
a
person
aggrieved
where
person
b
is
being
--
is
hurt,
the
injury,
the
injury
to
b,
not
to
a
is
the
means
of
hurting
a.
but
where
it
is
a
consequence
of
hurting
a,
that
doesn't
fall
within
the
statute.
that
gets
rid
of
the
bowling
alley,
it
gets
rid
of
the
landlord,
it
gets
rid
of
the
shareholder,
it
gets
rid
of
all
the
people
who
--
who
--
who
are
not
the
person
retaliated
against,
but
they
suffer
injury
because
he
was
retaliated
against.
it
keeps
the
people
who
are
being
used
as
a
means.
they
can
bring
the
lawsuit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if,
in
fact,
you
set
in
motion
hurting
mrs.
smith,
the
child,
the
wife,
even
the
coworker,
though
that
would
be
hard
to
get
pass
burlington,
if
you
do
that
in
order
to
hurt
a,
to
retaliate
against
a,
b
can
bring
the
suit?
but
if
b
is
a
person
who
is
injured
only
because
you
retaliated
a,
but
really
wasn't
the
means,
b
can't
bring
the
suit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
the
problem
with
my
theory.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
are
--
i
do
--
i
think
that
it
isn't
so
hard
to
find
in
some
of
the
sources
that
justice
ginsburg
mentioned
and
others
instances
where
the
only
kinds
of
suits
that
have
been
allowed
are
where
it
was
like
a
family
member
or
was
being
used
as
a
means,
and
there
never
have
been
cases
where
they
allowed
somebody
who
was
just
suffering
consequent
injury.
so
it's
quite
possible
i
can
be
borne
out,
though
i
think
your
criticism
is
a
pretty
good
one.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure
why
the
employer's
intent
comes
into
this.
a
is
the
person
who
is
being
retaliated
against,
and
the
issue
would
be
did
the
employer
take
such
action
against
b
as
the
a
would
think,
quite
reasonably
--
he
would
have
to
reasonably
think
--
that
the
actions
that
the
employer
took
was
retaliation,
was
meant
to
be
--
whatever
those
words
were,
was
--
it
might
well
have
dissuaded
a
reasonable
worker
from
making
or
supporting
a
charge
of
discrimination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
would
have
to
show
he
had
a
retaliatory
intent,
that's
true,
but
that's
true
however
he
retaliates.
