what
separates
a
stereotype
from
a
reality?
do
you
say
it
is
not
true
that
if
there
is
a
legitimate
--
illegitimate
child,
it
is
much
more
likely
that
the
woman
will
end
up
caring
for
it
than
that
the
father
would?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hubacheck,
you
are
asking,
i
think,
that
the
court
pronounce
your
client
to
be
a
united
states
citizen.
isn't
that
the
only
pronouncement
from
--
form
the
court
that
is
going
to
do
your
client
any
good?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
he's
a
united
states
citizen.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
on
the
grounds
that
your
client
is
a
united
states
citizen,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
he
is,
not
that
--
that
he
is.
that
he
is.
do
you
have
any
other
case
where
a
court
has
conferred
citizenship
on
someone
who,
under
the
statutes
as
written,
does
not
have
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
never
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
--
unless
we
--
we
solve
the
violation
the
other
way,
by
saying
that
the
father
gets
the
shorter
period
that
the
--
than
the
mother
has.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry,
that
the
mother
gets
the
longer
period
than
the
father
has.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
we
can't
apply
that
retroactively.
well,
okay;
we
don't
apply
it
retroactively.
the
people
that
have
citizenship
cannot
constitutionally
be
deprived
of
it,
but
for
everybody
else,
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fiallo
v.
bell.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
--
why
would
we
grant
that
remedy
when
it
doesn't
do
this
petitioner
any
good
whatever.
it's
--
it's
a
remedy
that
doesn't
remedy.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
--
we
aren't
granting
relief
that
doesn't
provide
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
be
in
effect
saying
that
we
have
no
jurisdiction,
because
there
is
no
standing.
because
there
--
there
is
no
remediation
that
the
court
can
make.
