justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
--
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
finish.
are
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
quite
follow
this.
as
i
understand
it,
on
what
--
say:
on
what
remedy
will
there
be
if
you're
right?
this
is
what
i
don't
understand.
a
child
is
born
abroad.
one
parent
is
american;
the
other
is
foreign.
if
the
two
are
married,
that
child
is
american
only
if
the
father
or
the
mother
--
one
or
the
other
--
has
lived
in
the
united
states
for
now
at
least
2
years.
it
used
to
be
more.
okay?
now
it's
5
years
after
the
age
of
16.
now
suppose
they
are
not
married,
and
suppose
the
american
is
the
father.
same
rule.
now
suppose
they
are
not
married
and
the
american
is
the
mother.
now
it's
not
5
years
or
2
years;
you
only
have
to
have
lived
here
for
one
year.
suppose
i
agree
with
you.
i
just
don't
see
any
sense
to
that
whatsoever.
i
can't
figure
it
out.
they
made
a
mistake
about
the
immigration
laws.
then
why
isn't
the
remedy,
say:
okay,
whether
it
is
the
father
or
the
mother,
the
general
rule
applies.
they
have
to
have
lived
in
the
united
states
for
5
years
or
for
2
years?
now
2
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
some
people
were
lucky,
and
they
are
already
citizens
under
this,
and
there
we
are,
because
their
mother
lived
in
the
united
states
for
one
year.
those
already
are
citizens.
nobody
is
going
to
take
that
away.
we
are
just
looking
at
a
statute.
and
in
the
first
part
of
the
statute,
they
have
in
section
(g)
of
1401,
the
first
rule
i
told
you
about.
in
1409(a),
the
second
rule,
and
in
1409(c),
the
third
rule.
okay.
if
you
are
right
about
this,
and
it's
totally
unfair
and
there
is
no
good
reason
whatsoever
for
distinguishing
on
the
basis
of
gender,
we
strike
(g).
okay?
now,
that
would
seem
to
be
normal,
but
that
isn't
going
to
help
your
client.
so
how
do
you
get
to
some
other
thing
that
instead
of
striking
(g)?
what
we
do
is
strike
all
of
(a)
and
strike
the
whole
thing
before,
and
shove
them
all
into
(g),
which
isn't
so
easy
to
do
with
this
language.
how
do
you
get
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
so
we
strike
(g).
what
i'm
worried
about
is,
you
want
me
to
strike
(a)
--
sorry,
we
strike
(c).
and
you
want
me
to
strike
1409(a)
and
1401(g),
and
shove
the
people
who
are
there
into
(g),
which
is
a
little
tough
to
do
in
the
english
language.
but
i
want
to
know
how
you
get
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
there's
another
slight
problem
with
that,
i
would
think.
reading
this
carefully,
which
i
hope
i
have
done,
it
seems
to
me
it
may
also
discriminate
against
fathers.
and
that's
because
(c)
says
that
the
woman
has
to
have
been
physically
present
for
a
continuous
period
of
one
year.
i
read
at
least
one
article
that
says
that
word,
"continuous",
doesn't
appear
with
the
fathers,
and
that
they
really
mean
it.
that
is,
if
somebody
is
living
down
in
texas
and
they
happen
to
go
visit
on
christmas
their
father,
who
is
--
or
their
grandmother
or
cousin
or
something
who
is
across
the
border
for
5
minutes,
that
they
cannot
take
advantage
of
this
clause
(c).
is
that
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
will
ask
the
(g)
that,
but
if
it
is
true
--
if
it
is
true,
then
--
then
i
would
think
that
the
fathers
are
really
worse
off.
i
don't
know
if
that
helps
you.
and
maybe
it
could
turn
out
that
that's
really
a
problem.
if
it
is
really
a
problem,
then
the
fathers
are
worse
off.
does
that
help
you
with
the
remedy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is:
i'm
looking
for
a
way
--
i'm
trying
to
be
helpful
in
my
question.
i'm
looking
for
a
way
that
you
can
get
to
your
result.
now
i'm
not
saying
i
would
do
it,
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
best
way
is
of
getting
to
that
result,
where
you
shove
everyone
into
(c)
instead
of
just
cutting
(c).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
help
you.
is
there
a
reason
for
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that,
but
what
you
are
doing
is
applying
a
lesser
standard
to
gender
discrimination
than
is
ordinarily
applied
to
gender
discrimination.
now,
is
there
any
reason
to
do
that?
i
think
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
the
government's
position
you
do,
does
the
same
thing
apply
to
racial
discrimination?
do
you
also
apply
a
lesser
standard
to
racial
discrimination?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
suddenly
is
cutting
a
big
hole
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
--
we
have
the
briefs
that
are
filled
with,
you
know,
pros
and
cons
about
the
statelessness
business
and
whether
it
was
real,
and
i've
read
those
and
i
would
like
your
comment
on
those,
but
i
want
to
comment,
too,
on
this
very
--
what
may
be
a
very
minor
thing,
but
i
did
notice,
prodded
by
an
article,
i
have
to
say,
that
--
that
for
the
women
there
is
a
sense
in
which
its
tougher--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that's
because
of
the
continuous
period.
now,
i
guess
it
depends
on
how
that
is
enforced,
but
there
could
be
a
class
of
people,
say,
living
in
the
border,
near
canada
or
near
mexico
where
they
step
across
the
border
on
christmas
day
to
say
hello
to
my
cousin,
and
--
and
does
that
stop
them
from
taking
advantage
of
that?
is
it
--
in
other
words,
how
is
this
enforced?
is
it
enforced
with
that
rigidity?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
means
that
you
can't
stop
with
across
the
border?
you
can't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
--
is
there
--
well,
is
there
or
isn't
there,
to
your
knowledge?
is
this
enforced
with
total
rigidity
or
is
it
enforced
that
maybe
you
could
go
once
a
month
or
you
could
go
on
your
birthday,
or
what
is
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
that
situation
you
cannot
go
across
the
border?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
if
it's
tough
then
and
really
is
meant
to
be
tough,
then
there
is
a
--
what
is
the
rationale
for
treating
women
in
this
respect
worse
than
treating
men?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
1
year,
i
grant
you,
the
time
1
year
is
treating
them
better
than
the
time
5
years.
but
the
word
"continuous",
it's
really
tough
is
what
your
answer
leads
me
to
believe,
and
they
really
mean
it.
i
mean,
then
that's
treating
them
worse
than
treating
the
men.
and
i
would
like
to
know
what
is
the
rationale
for
treating
them
worse?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
--
is
there
anything
that
rings
a
bell
in
this
in
your
mind,
of
--
i
mean,
the
thing
that
goes
the
other
way
is
the
right
of
an
american
citizen
to
pass
his
american
citizenship
on
to
his
children.
and
when
we
talk
about
--
when
we
talk
about
congress's
power
over
naturalization,
is
there
anything
that's
drawn
a
distinction
between
the
general
power,
which
are
people
who
are
not
citizens
to
become
citizens,
but
what
it
seems
to
me
intuitively
is
a
different
situation,
of
the
right
to
pass
your
citizenship
on?
does
that
ring
any
bell
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
there
is
such
a
right.
i
just
wonder
if
it
rings
any
bell
at
all
that
this
has
ever
been
discussed
in
anything
you've
come
across.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
just
looking
--
in
trying
to
get
your
memory
--
well,
does
something
come
to
mind
the
opposite
way
that
--
where
the
court
did
go
into
a
long
exegesis
about
the
law,
including
constitutional
law,
and
then
says
at
the
end,
well,
but
you
are
not
entitled
to
memory
--
to
a
remedy
because
of
some
other--
