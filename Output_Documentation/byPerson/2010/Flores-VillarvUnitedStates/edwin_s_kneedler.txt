mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
in
deciding
who
among
the
various
people
born
abroad
should
be
made
citizens
of
the
united
states
has
to
take
into
account
myriad
factors
that
may
bear
on
that
question
and
its
judgment.
they
include
importantly
congress's
prediction
in
the
case
of
conferring
citizenship
at
birth,
what
would
be
that
person's
likely
connection
to
the
united
states.
congress
also
has
to
consider
the
interaction
with
the
laws
of
other
countries
where
these
people
may
be
born.
it
may
take
into
account
equities,
potential
statelessness
or
dual
nationality.
these
are
complicated
questions
to
which
the
courts
should
defer.
now,
in
the
particular--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--excuse
me.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
and
we
believe
that
under
this
court's
decisions,
particularly
in
fiallo
v.
bell
and
the
cases
discussed
in
that
case,
that
it
should
be
rational
basis
for--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
lies
in
the
court's
formulation
of
the
test
that
is
applied
in
this
particular
context,
and
that
is
the
formulation
drawn
from
kleindienst
v.
mandel
that
was
articulated
in
fiallo
v.
bell,
and
that
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
facially
legitimate
and
bona
fide
reason.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
the
court
could
have
no
trouble
concluding
that
an
arbitrary
choice
between
men
and
women--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
--
the
ultimate
reason
may
be
legitimate,
but
i
think
the
facial
legitimate
test
also
encompasses
means
not
just
end,
and
if
congress
is
just
arbitrarily
choosing
between
men
and
women
or
people
of
a
different
race,
i
think
given
this
court's
tradition
it
could
conclude
that
those
would
be
impermissible
bases
under
the
well-established
test,
but
for
the
reasons
we
say
in
our
brief
we
don't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--fiallo
v.
bell
for
--
and
the
cases
underlying
it
and
we
also
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--you
could
call
it
that
or
you
could
call
it
a
facially
legitimate--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
it
is
--
it
is
a
test
that
this
court
has
articulated
in
fiallo
v.
bell
and
kleindienst
v.
mandel
to
address
this
very
situation,
including
a
situation
where
asserted
constitutional
rights
of
u.s.
citizens
in
this
country
are
being
claimed.
and
we
agree
with
justice
kennedy
that
the
standard
should
not
be
more
demanding,
but
rather
if
anything
it
should
be
less
demanding
where
the
question
is
whether
someone
should
be
made
a
citizen.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
would
argue
for
the
facially
legitimate
--
and
that
was
the
case
in
fiallo,
in
which
the
plaintiffs
included
u.s.
citizens,
children
and
fathers,
claiming
that,
in
a
very
parallel
situation
claiming
that
that
special
privileges
for
illegitimate
children
to
reunite
with
the
mother
worked
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
the
fathers
of
such
children.
and
it
was
u.s.
citizen
fathers
and
children
who
were
among
the
plaintiffs
and
the
court
nonetheless
said
that
this
is
--
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
pass
citizenship,
this
is
a
question
of
congress's
judgment
about
who
it
believes
should
be
made
citizens.
and
one
of
the
important
factors
congress
has
looked
at
is
connection
to
a
u.s.
citizen
that
is
in
turn
a
proxy
for
what
the
likely
connection
to
the
united
states
will
be.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
was
the
issue.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
the
facially
legitimate
standard
in
fiallo
v.
bell
would
render
a
reliance
on
race.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
that
same
principle
would
be
given
effect
in
the
way--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
wasn't,
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
constitution,
anyone
born
abroad
is
an
alien
unless
and
until
congress
has
passed
a
statute
making
them
a
citizen.
so
analytically,
doctrinally
it
is
the
same
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
there
were
claims
based
on
both
illegitimacy
and
gender
and
there
were
equal
protection
claims
based
on
both.
but
if
i
could
move
on
to
the
way
that
the
statute
operates
because
we
think
it
satisfies
either
standard
of
review
in
this
case.
and
if
i
could
just
step
back
for
a
moment.
as
i
mentioned,
there
are
a
number
of
factors
that
congress
takes
into
account
in
crafting
a
statute
like
this.
1401
deals
with
married
couples
and
where
both
parents
are
citizens,
all
that
is
required
is
that
one
of
the
parents
have
resided
in
the
united
states
prior
to
the
birth.
where
you
have
mixed
parentage,
the
background
of
the
enactment
of
this
in
1940
and
reenactment
in
1952
and
continued
up
to
this
present
day
is
congress
was
concerned
that
such
a
child
may
not
have
the
requisite
connection
to
the
united
states.
they
have
a
connection
to
the
parent,
but
may
not
have
a
connection
to
the
united
states
such
that
congress
wanted
to
grant
citizenship
to
that
person.
so
what
congress
did
in
the
mixed
citizenship
situation
was
to
require
prior
residency
of
the
parent
as
a
talisman,
as
the
court
said
in
rogers
v.
bellei,
for
a
connection
to
the
united
states
of
ten
years,
five
years
after
the
age
of
14.
congress
has
liberalized
that,
but
that
was
the
basic
thought.
where
you
have
unwed
parents,
in
1409(a)
what
congress
did
was
to
follow
general
principles
of
the
law
of
illegitimacy
or
children
born
out
of
wedlock,
if
a
father
legitimates
a
child
then
it's
as
if
the
child
was
born
in
a
marriage,
and
the
rule
in
1401
with
respect
to
marriage
applies.
that
is
true
whether
both
parents
are
citizens
or
in
a
mixed
marriage
situation.
if
a
father
legitimates
a
child
and
both
parents
are
citizens,
then
not
the
one,
then
the
child
benefits
from
the
rule
that
if
either
parent
was
present
in
the
united
states
before
birth
he's
a
citizen,
doesn't
have
to
satisfy
the
one
year
unbroken
residency
requirement
under
1409(c).
if
it's
mixed
parentage,
and
the
father
legitimates,
then
the
rule
applicable
to
married
mixed
citizen
and
parents
applies
as
if
the
child
had
been
married
at
the
outset.
it's
a
perfectly
sensible
and
provision
or
approach
and
consistent
with
the
way
this
has
been
done.
what
congress
did
with
respect
to
the
mother
of
the
child
born
out
of
wedlock
where
there
has
not
have
been
legitimation
is
to
confer
citizenship
on
the
basis
of
a
one
year
residency.
now,
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
explains,
a
mother
in
that
situation
who
at
the
moment
of
birth,
as
this
court
understood
in
nguyen,
that
mother
may
be
the
only
either
legal
parent
or
the
only
parent
at
the
moment
of
birth
with
the
requisite
connection
to
the
child
to
have
an
opportunity
for
this
sort
of
connection
at
birth.
so
the
mother
in
that
circumstance
is
very
much
like
the
two
citizen
parent
family,
the
only
parents
are
parents
with
a
connection
to
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
that
would
be
--
that
would
depend
upon
a
--
a
--
a
different
rationale.
i
mean
here
what
congress--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that
would
be
a
more
difficult
question,
because
congress
would
be
--
would
be
responding
based
on
the
--
on
the
expected
behaviors
and
talents
maybe
of
men
and
women.
what's
different
here
is
that's
not
what
it's
--
that's
not
the
basis
for
this
classification.
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
and
in
that
situation,
congress
i
think
could
be
expected
and
maybe
should
be
required
to
do
that
in
a
gender-neutral
basis
because
it
is
premising
it
on
the
behavior,
but
--
but
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that
--
and
--
and
the
question
would
be
whether
that's
a
facially
legitimate
rationale.
and
--
and
i
would
want
to
know
--
i
think
i
would
want
to
know
more
about
what
the
record
for
such
a
justification
would
be,
et
cetera.
but
i
--
but
i
would
like
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
and
in
--
in
that
situation,
i
think
it
would
be
expanding
on
a
gender-neutral
basis
rather
than
singling
out
one
parent
or
the
other.
but
i
--
but
i
would
like
to
finish
the
description,
i
have
because
it's
incomplete
and
there
is
a
critical
piece
left
out,
and
that
is
that
counsel
for
petitioner
says
that
if
--
if
a
father
legitimates
an
out-of-wedlock
child,
he
is
in
the
same
position
or
that
child
is
in
the
same
position
as
a
child
in
an
out-of-wedlock
mother,
and
that
is
not
likely
to
be
so,
and
it's
not
likely
to
be
so
at
birth.
and
this
is
the
reason
why,
is
when
a
child
is
legitimated,
there
are
two
parents
who
have
the
strong
connection
that
was
described
in
this
court's
decision
in
nguyen
to
that
child,
the
u.s.
citizen
father,
but
also
the
mother,
the
alien
mother
in
that
country.
so
you
have
two
parents
whose
interests
have
to
be
taken
into
account.
whereas
in
the
situation
congress
was
addressing
in
1409(c),
the
situation
of
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock
where
there
was
no
--
at
the
moment
of
birth,
likely
to
be
no
recognized
father,
have
you
only
the
mother.
if
we
--
if
we
think
of
this
in
--
in
parallel
to
the
illegitimacy
--
the
cases
involving
illegitimates
that
this
court
has
had
in
a
domestic
context,
i
think
that
is
instructive.
in
a
case
like
lehr,
where
the
question
was
whether
the
father
of
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock
should
have
received
notice
of
a
prospective
adoption,
the
court
explained
in
that
case
that
the
father
had
not
taken
the
steps
necessary
to
form
the
relationship
with
the
child,
and
therefore,
be
--
be
a
father
in
the
eyes
of
the
law,
then
the
mother
alone--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
does
have
to
be
continuous
residency,
you're
correct--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
might
be
minor
exceptions
where
you
go
across
the
border
in
christmas
eve.
that
i
can't
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
in
that
situation,
no.
and
the
example
that
i
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
example
i
was
given
when
i
asked
this
question
was,
if
you
have
somebody
who's
on
--
who
lives
in
mexico
and
commutes
to
the
united
states,
you
know,
5
days
a
week,
you
can
under
--
under
--
under
1401,
you
can
add
up
each
day,
and
get
to
a
total
of
5
or
10
years
of
continuous
--
excuse
me
--
of
actual
physical
presence,
that
would
not
satisfy
the
continuous--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--congress
--
the
1-year
provision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
congress
--
congress
selected,
because
while
i
said
the
mothers
are
like
the
two-citizen
family
or
two-citizen
parents
in
the
sense
that
only
u.s.
citizens
are
the
parent
and
you
have
some
connection,
congress
was
balancing
the
duration
of
that
connection
or
taking
into
account
the
duration
of
that
connection
and
it
chose
to
make
it
a
little
bit
tougher.
and
i
--
i
think
that
is
perfectly
legitimate,
because
congress
--
because
you
only
have
one
parent
and
congress
was
deciding,
well
if
somebody
has
been
here
for
a
continuous
period
of
1
year,
then
there
--
then
there
is
probably
a
greater
likelihood
that
that
person
will
--
will
have
roots
here
then,
for
example,
the
other
situation
where
if
you
had
a
child
born
abroad
and
came
home
in
the
summers,
that
child
may
not
think
of
himself
or
may
not
be
regarded
as
an
american
in
the
same
way.
so,
what
congress
was
focusing
on
a
--
on
a
period
of
longer
duration,
which
in
its
judgment
could
--
could
give
rise
to,
congress
believed,
a
greater
connection
to
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
--
i
think
the
court
ought
to
strike
the
eligibility
of
--
of
anyone
to
get
citizenship
on
the
basis
of
1
year.
i
think
it
could
--
should
constrict
the
--
the
class
to
those
specifically
governed
by
1401--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
it
is
a
solution
--
it's
a
remedy--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
--
i
--
i
think
this
court
could
legitimately
take
into
account
the
--
the
conferral
of
citizenship
and
the
reliance
on
that.
i
think
it's
parallel
to
--
to
heckler
v.
matthews,
where
the
court
upheld
a
statute
in
which
congress
took
account
of
reliance
interest
that
had
built
up
on
your--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
--
i
think.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think
he
does
not.
i
think
--
i
think
the
answer
is
that
the
--
and
--
and
partly
for
the
reasons
that
you
alluded
to
and
justice
scalia
mentioned,
we
do
not
think
that
a
court
can
properly
grant
u.s.
citizenship,
and
that
that
should
enforce
--
excuse
me
--
inform
the
remedy,
and
it
--
but
for
the
people
who
have
been
granted
citizenship,
i
think
the
solution
would
be
to
invalidate
the
1-year
residency
requirement.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
suppose
--
i
suppose--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
court
could
--
could
decide
that
at
the
outset,
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
grant
that
relief
and
not
go
--
and
not
go
any
further.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
i
--
i
agree
with
that
as
well,
which
i
think
is
all
the
more
reason
for
the
court
to
be
cautious
about
--
about
entering
into
this.
i
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
here
the
only
claim
that
has
been
raised
is
an
equal
protection
violation
of
the
parent's
asserted
rights.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
insofar
as
any
claim
of
discrimination
by
the
child,
i
think,
since
it's
not
based
on
the
child's
gender,
i
think
that
would
clearly
be
a
rational
basis
or
facially
legitimate
standard;
and
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
miller
v.
albright
addressed
the
rational
basis
there.
and
here,
this
is
not
just
based
on
the
gender
of
the
parent,
it's
based
on
the
--
on
the
complexities
in
the
legal
history
with
respect
to
illegitimacy,
and
--
and
how
children
born
out
of
wedlock
are
dealt
with,
which
again
turns
not
on
--
on
stereotypes
of
behavior
or
talents,
but
on
longstanding
legal
regimes
not
just
in
this
country
but
in
--
in
other
countries,
that
until
the
father
does
something
to
have
a
meaningful
relationship,
the
mother
is
the
--
is
the
only
legal
parent,
or
in
the
terminology
of
this
court's
decision
in
nguyen,
the
parent
who
is
likely
to
have
the
meaningful
relationship.
once
the
father
comes
forward
in
a
case
like
lehr,
the
result
is
not
that
the
father
gets
a
veto
power
or
that
that
only
the
father's
interests
are
taken
into
account;
the
answer
is
that
you
have
two
parents
whose
interests
are
taken
into--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
again,
i
think
this
is
the
issue
the
court
addressed
in
nguyen,
in
which
the
court
--
the
court
said
that
there
is
--
there
is
a
difference
at
the
moment
of
birth
in
the
potential
and
therefore
the
likelihood
of
a
--
of
a
connection
of
child
to
parent
at
the
moment
of
birth
that
justified
the
requirement
that
--
that
the
father
take
a
step
to
legitimate
the
child,
in
order
to
be
able
to
--
to
be
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
mother
with
respect
to
--
to
the
rights.
and
here
the
residency
requirement
is
what
measures
the
connection
of
the
parent
to
the
united
states,
not
the
child
to
the
parent;
but
we
think
the
same
point
obtains,
that
at
the
moment
of
birth
in
another
country,
for
example,
another
country
might
take
a
view
that
this
court
did
in
nguyen
and
lehr
and
cases
like
that,
that
the
father
doesn't
have
a
meaningful
connection
to
the
child
in
the
sense
that
one
would
predict
citizenship
on
the
basis
of,
until
there
had
been
some
formal
steps
which
would
happen
after
birth
to
establish
the
relationship
with
the
child.
if
it
was
constitutional
for
congress
to
do
that
in
nguyen,
it
is
constitutional
for
congress
to
take
into
account
that
other
countries
might
do
the
very
same
thing.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
yes,
but
in
nguyen
the
court
did
not
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
it
looked
--
it
looked
generally
to
what
would
have
justified
congress's
acting
categorically
as
we
think
congress
has
to
have
the
flexibility
to
do.
and
--
and
i
think
the
questions
in
these
statutory
provisions
show
that
there
are
numerous
competing
equities
and
considerations
that
have
to
be
taken
into
--
into
account.
and
that
--
that
is
what
--
that
is
what
congress
did
here
with
respect
to
establishing
a
--
to
requiring
a
close
nexus
to
the
united
states.
and
if
--
if
in
another
country
a
father
has
--
has
legitimated
or
done
those
steps,
then
you
have
a
u.s.
citizen
mother
and
a
father
in
another
country
that
is
directly
parallel
to
the
married
mixed
--
mixed
parent
marriage;
and
congress
was
concerned
about
whether
that
child
was
going
to
be
sufficiently
affiliated
with
the
united
states
to
justify
a
conferral
of
citizenship.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
um--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
have
--
i
don't
have
authority
from
--
from
a
decision
of
this
court.
i
may
--
i
may
be
not
recalling
something,
i
don't.
but
i
do
believe
in
the
special
context
--
context
of
citizenship,
that
there
might
a
justification
for
the
--
for
court's
doing
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
--
i
suppose
that
would
be
one
way
of
looking
at
it.
i
mean
the
court
traditionally
has
looked
at
--
at
questions
of
severability
as
--
as
a
question
of
remedy,
and
not
--
and
not
at
the
outset.
but
this
is
to
be
sure
a
very
peculiar
situation.
and
i
should
also
point
out--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think
that
is
ordinarily
the
case.
but
i
--
but
this
is
--
this
is
a
difficult
context,
and
just
to
go
back
with
a
complication
from
the
remedial
approach
that
the
chief
justice
suggested.
if
the
court
declared
an
expansion
of
citizenship,
and
if
that
was
held
to
apply
to
everybody
similarly
situated,
rather
than
just
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
it
would
raise
questions
about
whether
congress
would
have
the
freedom
after
such
a
declaration
of
a
perhaps
dramatic
expansion
of
citizenship
under
the
prior
law,
to
remedy
that
with
respect
to
people
who
for
the
--
following
this
court's
decision,
at
least
the
logic
of
the
court's
decision
would
suggest
that
they
were
citizens,
too.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
is
no
such
right.
and
wong
kim
ark--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
court's
decision
in
--
in
--
the
dissenters
in
--
in
nguyen
discussed
this.
but
we
think
it's
clear
that
under
this
--
under
wong
kim
ark
and
rogers
v.
bellei
that
--
that
that
is
equally
an
exercise
of
congress's
naturalization
power
which
is
subject
to
the
same
plenary
standards--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
this
is
going
back
to
remedy,
i
don't
specifically.
