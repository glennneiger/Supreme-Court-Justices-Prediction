chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
09-5801,
flores-villar
v.
united
states.
mr.
hubachek.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
this
is
--
maybe
you
would
like
to
answer
justice
breyer's
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
he
would
have
a
remedy.
the
remedy
for
an
equal
protection
violation
is
to
treat
everybody
the
same.
you
can
do
that
either
by
lowering
the
people
who
are
given
a
benefit
or
by
increasing
the
people
who
aren't.
so
he
has
a
remedy.
his
objection
is,
we're
not
being
--
my
father
and
my
mother
are
not
being
treated
the
same.
that's
all
of
the
relief
he
is
entitled
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what
if
--
if
the
court
were
to
determine
that
this
does
violate
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
the
court
were
also
to
determine
that
this
is
not
a
case
that
should
be
the
first
one
in
history
in
which
it
grants
naturalization,
what
do
you
think
the
court
ought
to
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
ground
that
it
violates
equal
protection.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
your
friend's
point
that
that
retroactively
deprives
people
of
citizenship
that
we
would
be
saying
they
should
have
gotten
if
the
equal
protection
clause
had
been
enforced.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
but
here,
of
course,
under
my
scenario
we
don't
have
a
situation
where
congress
has
addressed
--
addressed
the
problem.
so
what
do
we
do?
if
somebody
under
the
theory
that
we
say
this
person
should
not
have
been
denied
citizenship
because
of
the
unequal
protection
in
the
law,
and
he
comes
in
and
it's
the
same
situation,
he's
going
to
be
deported
for
not
being
an
american
citizen
and
he
says
i'm
an
american
citizen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
he
get
the
benefit
of
that
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
reason
it
doesn't
grant
that
relief
is
somewhat
unusual
in
this
case.
it
only
doesn't
grant
him
relief
because
of
the
third-party
standing.
he
doesn't
care
whether
he's
treated
equally
or
not;
he
just
wants
to
be
--
claim
the
benefit
of
citizenship.
the
person
where
he
would
get
relief
is
if
it
were
the
father,
because
the
relief
that
he
is
entitled
to
is
to
be
treated
equally.
that's
it.
the
relief
this
person
is
asking
for
is
not
to
be
deported.
and
so
the
problem
of
the
relief
being
granted
is
really
complicated
by
the
fact
that
it's
a
case
of
third-party
standing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
we
determine
that
the
only
remedy
we
can
impose
is
to
equalize
up
--
in
other
words,
add
to
the
burden
on
the
mother
rather
than
relieving
the
father
of
it,
do
you
have
authority
for
the
proposition
that
we
can
address
that
issue
hypothetically?
in
other
words,
without
making
a
decision
on
the
equal
protection
question
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
look
ahead
and
if
you
say,
look,
the
only
remedy
that
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
give
this
person
is
a
remedy
that
isn't
going
to
benefit
him
regardless
of
how
the
merits
are
decided,
therefore
we
don't
reach
the
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hubachek,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
referred
--
i'm
sorry,
you
refer
to
the
tradition
of
passing
--
do
you
agree
with
mr.
kneedler
that
there
is
no
such
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel,
the
case
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
09-5801,
flores-villar
versus
united
states,
the
judgment
is
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
