but
that
doesn't
answer,
i
don't
think,
justice
ginsberg's
question,
which
is:
this
appears
to
be
an
exception
to
a
generalized
non-gender
based
requirement.
couples,
male
or
female,
and
fathers,
unmarried
fathers,
are
subject
to
five
years.
only
unmarried
mothers
get
the
largesse
of
one
year.
why
isn't
--
why
shouldn't
everybody
just
be
put
to
the
broader
category
rather
than
extending
a
largesse
to
a
greater
number
of
people?
justice

so
doesn't
the
5-year
residency
requirement
address
that?
if
we
apply
it
generally,
wouldn't
the
5-year
residency
requirement
honor
congress's
concern
about
there
being
a
substantial
tie
to
the
states?

intermediate
scrutiny
and
--
is
not
without
some
deference.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
unless
we
apply
strict
scrutiny,
which
no
one
is
arguing
for,
the
question
is,
is
it
rational
basis
deference
or
is
it
some
intermediate
scrutiny,
correct?
justice
sonia

well,
but
you
can't
really
mean
that
because
we
can
put
up
a
hypothetical
that
is
very
simple
and
then
you'll
explain
to
me
why
a
u.s.
citizen
should
be
burdened
in
this
way
and
the
hypothetical
is,
let's
assume
congress
determines
that
there
are
too
many
foreign-born
children
of
u.s.
citizens
coming
into
the
united
states,
and
that
those
foreign-born
children,
those
born
of
women
are
placing
a
greater
burden
on
our
economic
system.
they
need
more
care
for
reasons
that
congress
determines
analytically
or
statistically.
they
are
spending
more
money
--
more
government
money.
and
congress
passes
a
rule
that
says,
only
the
foreign-born
children
of
men
can
come
into
the
country,
not
of
women.
wouldn't
that
be
a
rational
basis?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
is
a
facially
legitimate
bona
fide
reason.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
arbitrary
about
a
government
saying,
i
want
to
spend
less
money
on
a
new
citizen?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
the
rational
basis
plus
test
you
are
talking
about?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
now
we're
going
to
just
continue
sort
of
tweaking
the
definitions
and
creating
more
variations
on
our
review
standard?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
hard
here
because
both
the
father
--
this
father,
but
many
fathers
and
mothers
are
actually
u.s.
citizens
who
want
to
bring
their
children
over
as
u.s.
citizens.
so,
if
the
father
was
making
the
claim
here,
you
would
still
argue
it
was
a
rational
basis
test
even
though
he's
a
u.s.
citizen
and
entitled
to
all
the
protections
of
the
constitution?
