justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
--
is
this
your
--
are
you
taking
this
in
the
direction
of
an
argument
that
congress
gets
less
deference
in
determining
nationality
than
it
does
with
admission
to
aliens?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
--
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
that
says
congress
has
less
deference
when
it
considering
--
when
it
determines
who
should
be
a
national
of
this
country
than
it
--
than
when
it
determines
who
should
be
admitted
as
an
alien?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
asking
us
to
write
that
formulation
in
an
opinion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
--
if
i
take
that
as
a
"yes"
answer,
what
is
your
authority
for
that
answer?
it
seems
to
me
that
it
ought
to
be
just
the
other
way
around.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
but
it
was
congress
that
made
the
distinction.
but
you
are
asking
us
to
say
that
congress
has
less
authority
over
this
essential
issue
as
to
who
should
be
nationals
in
the
united
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
maybe
there
is
some
authority
for
that.
do
you
have
any
authority?
is
there
something
i
can
read
that
tells
me
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
an
alien
admissions
case.
you
are
talking
about
nationality.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
any
of
--
of
the
remedies
that
you
are
discussing
with
justice
scalia
involves
this
court
in
a
highly
intrusive
exercise
of
the
congressional
power.
let
me
just
ask
you
this
as
an
analytic
matter,
or
as
matter
of
logical
priorities.
we
usually
talk
about
substance
first,
remedy
second.
do
you
think
it's
permissible,
logically,
for
us
to
say
that
because
the
remedies
here
are
so
intrusive,
that
bears
on
our
choice
of
whether
we
or
not
we
use
intermediate
or
rational
basis
scrutiny,
and
because
the
remedies
are
so
difficult,
we
are
going
to
use
rational
basis
scrutiny?
is
that
a
logical
way
to
proceed?
