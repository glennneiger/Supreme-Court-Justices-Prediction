mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
nguyen,
the
court
approved
the
imposition
of
legitimation
requirement
only
upon
fathers
of
non-marital
children
born
abroad.
that
was
based
on
biological
differences
between
men
and
women.
it
provided
proof
of
parentage
and
proof
of
an
opportunity
to
make
a
relationship
with
the
child
that
adhered
in
birth
as
to
the
mother.
but
here,
the
residential
requirements
that
are
at
issue
here
have
no
biological
basis.
they
set
up
barriers
to
the
transmission
of
citizenship
by
younger
fathers,
but
not
younger
mothers,
and
they
are
based
upon
gender
stereotypes
that
women,
not
men,
would
care
--
would
care
for
non-marital
children.
that
scheme
has
been
--
the
solicitor
general
has
attempted
to
justify
that
scheme
by
claiming
that
congress
was
concerned
about
statelessness,
but
the
record
doesn't
support
that
claim.
both
the
1935
law
review
article--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--what
i
was
saying--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--i
think
it
is
more
likely,
but
i
think
that
empirical
evidence
has
not
carried
the
day
in
gender
discrimination
cases.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
absolutely,
and
this
is
actually
beyond
just
an
empirical
stereotype.
the
--
at
congressional
hearings,
it
was
said
that
the
woman
is
the
sole
legal
parent
of
this
child,
totally
excluding
the
man,
which
basically
dates
back
to
the
notion
of
coverture
where
men
were
completely
out
of
the
picture
and
women
were
the
ones
who
were
responsible.
so
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
--
the
empirical
portion
of
it,
there
is
also
just
the
notion
that
the
legal
parent
was
the
woman.
and
that
was
specifically--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
the
law
of
many
countries
was
that
citizenship
did
go
through
the
mother.
but
with
respect
to
legitimation
and
this
statute,
congress
drew
a
distinction
between
all
--
all
parents
of
--
excuse
me,
all
fathers
of
non-marital
children
and
those
who
are
legitimate.
this
statute
applies
only
to
those
who
are
legitimate.
the
very
law
review
article
that
congress
relied
upon,
according
to
the
solicitor
general,
says
that
in
the
case
of
legitimation,
citizenship
goes
through
the
father.
so
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
very
--
the
very
article
they
relied
upon
said
that
in
one
instance
it
goes
through
the
mother,
but
in
the
instance
of
the
people
who
are
actually
affected
through
this
statute,
those
who
legitimate,
it
goes
through
the
father.
and
there
are
also
a
number
of
situations
under
which
mothers--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--i
respectfully
disagree.
at
the
time,
in
1940,
when
this
statute
was
passed,
there
were
a
number
of
situations
where
it
wouldn't
go
through
the
mother.
in
china
and
japan,
if
the
father
was
merely
known
it
would
not
go
through
the
mother.
there
were
three
dozen
countries
at
this
time,
including
the
english
countries
and
those
who
followed
its
law,
in
which
if
their
female
citizen
gave
birth
to
a
child
somewhere
other
than
in
their
country,
citizenship
would
not
travel
through
that
mother
because
of
the
laws
of
those
particular
countries.
there
are
also
stateless
women.
so
in
all
those
situations,
the
citizenship
would
not
go
through
the
mother.
it
would
have
to
go
through
the
father,
and
this
statutory
scheme
doesn't
in
any
way
provide
for
that.
the
scheme
also
creates
severe
risks
of
statelessness,
as
is
set
out
in
the
statelessness
scholar's
brief,
for
married
fathers.
if
a
married
father
who
is
married
to
an
alien,
the
--
in
those
situations,
there
are
a
number
of
countries
that
would
not
allow
the
woman
to
transmit
citizenship.
so
if
the
father
was
precluded
by
laws
such
as
they
were
in
the
united
states,
that
child
would
end
up
stateless
as
well.
so
there
is
substantial
risk
of
statelessness
and
it
continues
today.
there
are
numerous
countries
that
have
basically
reinstituted
that
rule,
that
if
the
father
is
merely
known,
citizenship
would
not
transmit
through
the
mother.
and
those
are
primarily
in
the
middle
east
and
some
of
them
in
africa,
and
those
are
detailed
in
the
statelessness
scholars'
brief.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
this
is
not
a
case
where
congress
was
seeking
to
remedy
any
sort
of
past
discrimination
against
women,
as
was
the
case,
say,
in
schlesinger
v.
ballard.
there
was
no
discrimination
against
women.
up
until
very
shortly
before
this
statute
was
passed,
it
was
clear
under
the
state
department
practices
that
the
non-marital
children
of
women
did
get
women's
citizenship,
and
it
was
also
true
as
to
men.
so
there
was
no
discrimination
that
was
being
remedied
in
that
situation.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
the
reason
is,
justice
sotomayor,
is
that
we
are
not
talking
about
an
exception
here,
the
treatment
that
the
non-marital
mothers
were
getting.
that
was
the
standard
prior
to
the
1940
litigation
--
1940
legislation.
there
was
no
significance
residence
requirement.
then
congress
imposed
new
residence
requirements
because
it
was
concerned
about
the
foreign
influence
in
mixed
marriages,
meaning
someone
who
was
married
to
an
alien.
in
those
situations,
congress
specifically
said
in
the
record
that
they
were
concerned
that
when
those
children
were
born
abroad,
that
they
would
have
foreign
influence,
that
they
would
be
more
foreign
then
they
were
american.
that's
not--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--absolutely,
it
would.
and
that
--
for
--
that
concern
is
not
applicable
when
you
are
talking
about
two
u.s.
citizen
parents
to
whom
the
extended
residence
requirement
didn't
apply.
non-marital
mothers
were
assumed
to
be
the
ones
who
were
going
to
be
raising
the
children
without
the
influence
of
an
alien
father.
the
non-marital
fathers
are
in
the
same
category
as
those,
too.
those
non-marital
fathers
who
raise
their
children
on
their
own,
as
petitioner's
father
did
in
this
case,
are
not
subject
to
that
type
of
foreign
influence,
so
they
should
be
grouped
together
with
the
women
and
with
the
two-citizen
families,
because
they
have
the
lack
of
foreign
influence.
so
it's
only
as
to
the
mixed-marriage
couples
who
are
married
where
there
is
a
foreign
influence
problem,
and
they're
the
ones
to
whom
the
expanded
residence
required
--
was
applied.
now,
with
respect
to
the
--
the
solicitor
general
has
raised
concerns
about
the
plenary
power
doctrine.
and
i
would
argue
that
that
doesn't
apply
here
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
is,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
admission
of
aliens.
second
is
that
the
court
in
chadha
zadvydas
said
--
made
clear
that
even
when
exercising
that
power,
that
congressional
--
excuse
me
--
congress's
power
is
limited
by
constitutional
limitations.
now,
with
respect
to
the
entry
of
aliens,
congress
made
it
very
clear
in
passing
this
very
statute
that
they
considered
those
people
who
gained
citizenship
as
of
birth
to
be
differently
situated
than
aliens.
that
was
a
tradition
that
dated
back
to
1350.
in
1790,
congress
passed
a
statute
saying
that
children
born
abroad
to
citizens--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
we
are
talking
about
the
ability
of
a
united
states
citizen,
petitioner's
father,
to
transmit
citizenship,
and
that
that
is
a
traditional
interest.
citizenship
is
extremely
important
and
it's
a
tradition
that
citizens
have
been
able
to
do
for
years.
so
yes,
constitutional
limitations
should
apply
when
the
--
when
congress
is
drawing
distinctions
between
men
and
women--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
there
is
no
tradition
dating
back
to
1350
for
the
admission
of
aliens.
it's
--
it's--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--your
honor,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
--
that
the
due
process
guarantee
of
equal
protection
is
applicable
in
this
context
because
the
citizens
of
the
united
states--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
your
honor,
my
authority
for
that
answer
is
the
tradition
that
i
have
been
discussing.
congress
itself,
in
1940,
considered
people
who
gained
citizenship
by
birth
abroad
as
being
differently
situated
from
aliens,
aliens
who
naturalize.
in
fact,
they
said
that
that
was
universally--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
i
think
--
that's
--
that's
a--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--chadha
zadvydas
says
that
even
though
congress
has
plenary
power
over
the
immigration
power.
when
it
exercises
that
power,
it
has
to
apply
with
constitutional
limitations.
this
is
the
first
one
of
the
court's
cases
where--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--i'm
talking
about
citizenship
being
transmitted
by
a
united
states
citizen.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
petitioner's
father,
as
a
united
states
citizen,
has
equal
protection
--
equal
protection
clause,
protection
against
the
discrimination,
here
because
a
similarly-situated
woman
would
be
able
to
transmit
citizenship.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons
at
least
for
that,
your
honor.
first
is
that
there
is
a
structural
limitation
here
to
imposing
a
levelling-down
type
remedy,
because
citizenship
cannot
be
taken
away
once
it's
granted.
so
the
court
can't
remedy
the
problem
here--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
the
first
thing
is,
is
that
this
statute
contains
a
severability
clause.
very
similar
to--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--by
--
by
extension,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--that's
correct.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
justice
ginsberg,
i
don't
have
any
statistics
to
provide
the
court.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
yes,
justice
breyer.
anyway,
the
remedy
we
are
requesting
is
extension.
in
westcott
and
in
heckler,
the
court
looked
at
language
in
the
severability
clause
that
was
similar
to
this,
and
also
in
justice
harlan's
concurring
opinion
in
welsh,
and
said
that
type
of
language
in
a
severability
clause
gives
courts
power
to
grant
an
extension
remedy.
so
that's
what
we
are
requesting.
we're
requesting--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
justice
breyer.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
traditionally
in
immigration
law
when
you
have
continuous
requirements,
if
it's
a
short
trip,
casual
trip,
you
know,
then
those
--
that
requirement
is
not
considered
to
have
been
violated.
if
the
--
if
--
i
have
to
admit
i'm
having
a
hard
time
following
the
question.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
the
--
the
best
way
is
to
follow
the
court's
tradition
in
the
benefits
cases
such
as
wengler
and
wiesenfeld,
where
the
court
granted
an
extension
remedy
and
basically
treated--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
the
reason
for
doing
that
is,
is
that
the
language
that's
contained
in
the
severability
clause
is
similar
to
what
the
court
has
already
said
allows
an
extension
remedy.
and
the
other
problem
is,
is
that
if
the
court
doesn't
grant
an
extension
remedy,
it
leaves
petitioner
basically
without
a
remedy,
that
there
will
be
individuals
who
have
been
able
to
have
a--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--you
are
absolutely
right,
that
that
is
--
that
is
the
state
of
the
law.
and
my
point
is
that
structurally,
that
remedy
is
unavailable
here,
because
you
can't
take
away
the
citizenship
from
the
people
who
have
already
gotten
it.
and
the
notion
that
you
can
grant
us
prospective
relief
as
discussed
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
doesn't
make
any
sense,
either,
because
number
one,
this
statute,
the
one
we
are
talking
about
today,
doesn't
apply
past
people
who
were
born
before
1986.
but
the
thing
is
that
if
somebody
were
to
come
into
court
after
an
opinion
that
said
just
that
were
issued
--
someone
were
to
come
into
court
and
say,
i
want
to
claim
citizenship
through
my
mother,
that
person
would
still
be
entitled
to
citizenship
because
it's
as
of
the
day
of
birth.
so
this
is
a
retroactive
provision.
so
the
prospective
relief
notion
really
doesn't
makes
any
sense
in
this
context,
because
the
equal
protection
violations
have
basically
all
already
occurred
at
the
time
that
the
person
who
would
make
a
citizenship
claim
was
born,
and
we
would
still
be
left
in
a
situation
where
petitioner's
father
would
say
that
i
was
unable
to
transmit
citizenship
to
my
son
and
a
woman
who
was
similarly
situated
was
able
to.
so
that
type
of
remedy
is
unavailable.
in
the
court's
decision
in
iowa
v.
bennett,
the
bank
case,
they
actually
ordered
a
refund
of
the
taxes
that
were
collected
in
a
discriminatory
manner
dating
back
in
time.
so
if
you
could
factor
out
--
if
you
could
make
a
relief
that
would
take
away
the
benefit
that
others
had
received,
then
i
would
agree
that
that
is
available,
but
that's
not
possible
in
this
situation.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
absolutely.
and
in
many
of
the
benefits
cases,
the
same
--
the
same
analysis
was
available
and
that's
the
analysis
that
we
are
asking
that
the
court
apply
here.
but
we're
also
making--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--this
is
a
criminal
case,
so
technically
what
we
are
asking
is
for
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
and
opportunity
to
present
this--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--that
it
would
be
possible
for
him,
on
these
facts,
to
become
a
united
states
citizen,
yes.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
well,
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
was
debated,
of
course,
in
the
nguyen
and
miller
cases,
and
the
court
has
not
said
that
yet
but
it
can
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
but
it
can
in
this
case,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
one
is
the
fact
that
this
severability
clause
is
applicable
to
this
claim.
congress
actually
passed
a
statute,
1421(d),
in
this
same
statutory
scheme,
that
said
when
we
are
talking
about
naturalization
--
the
naturalization
of
aliens,
then
you
cannot
get
naturalization
under
those
circumstances
any
other
way
then
what's
set
out
in
this
statute.
they
didn't
say
that
as
to
claims
of
citizenship
as
of
birth.
so
there
is
a
negative
implication,
basically,
that
they
--
that
they
were
not
precluding
this
type
of
remedy
as
to
a
citizenship
claim
where
we
are
claiming
an
equal
protection
violation.
the
second
point
is
that
if
the
court
is
unable
to
grant
that
remedy,
that
would
leave
an
equal
protection
violation
in
place,
and
as
justice
harlan
made
clear
in
welsh--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--well,
again--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--right.
and
i
think
if
the
court--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--even
--
even
prospectively,
your
honor,
because
this
statute
says
you
have
citizenship
as
of
birth.
so
even
if
the
court
were
to
render
that
decision
and
someone
were
to
make
a
claim,
they
could
still
say:
i
had
citizenship
of
as
of
birth;
i.e.,
whenever
i
was
born,
which
is
before
the
court's
decision.
so
there
really
--
that
would
be
no
remedy
at
all.
it's
a
remedy--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
court
has
traditionally
has
said
that
the
--
the
questions
of
a
right
and
whether
or
not
there
exists
an
opportunity
to
make
a
claim
and
the
remedy
for
it
are
analytically
distinct.
so
i
don't
believe--
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
--that's
correct,
and
certainly
congress
could
do
that.
and
the
solicitor
general's
brief
makes
clear
that
what
was
being
balanced
here
was
concerns
about
--
according
to
them,
anyway
--
concerns
about
statelessness
on
the
one
hand
and
connection
to
the
united
states
on
the
other.
if
congress
hadn't
assumed
based
on
gender
stereotypes
that
men
weren't
caring
for
children,
then
it
would
have
--
it
would
have
been
able
to
put
them
in
the
same
category
as
women,
because
they
would
understand
that
both
of
them
would
be
caring
for
children.
and
it's
not
just
the
--
the
situation
in
1940.
as
time
has
gone
on,
i
believe
in
the
national
women's
center
brief
it
points
out
that
the
number
of
men
who
are
raising
children
in
single-parent
families
is
increasing
over
time.
so
the
problem,
if
anything,
is
getting
worse.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
the
current
system
is
five
years,
two
years
after
the
--
the
age
of
16
--
i'm
sorry,
after
the
age
of
14.
and
of
course,
that
age
requirement
here
completely
precluded
mr.
flores-villar's
father
from
being
able
to
transmit
citizenship
because
of
his
age.
that
kind
of
complete
preclusion
would
never
apply
to
a
woman
who
is
similarly
situated.
if
the
court
doesn't
have
any
questions,
i
will
reserve
my
time.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
rationale
that
the
solicitor
general's
office
offers
today
is
that
further
assumptions
can
be
made
that
even
after
men
do
the
things
that
the
court
said
were
legitimately
required
of
them,
that
they
legitimate,
that
they
have
an
opportunity
to
form
a
relationship
with
their
child,
that
further
gender-based
assumptions
should
be
put
into
place
and
say
that,
well,
but
you
are
not
going
to
be
the
real
father
or
you're
not
going
to
be
the
real
parent.
whereas
in
the
case
of
women
we
are
going
to
assume
that
when
they
had
have
the
nonmarital
child
they
are
going
to
be
in
charge
and
that
when
a
father
legitimates
and
does
whatever
is
required
wherever
the
child
is
born,
we
are
going
to
assume
that
the
mother
is
involved
still.
but
the
very
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate
that
that's
not
the
case.
that
in
this
case
petitioner's
father
raised
him
and
petitioner's
mother
was
not
involved
in
his
growing
up
and
he
brought
him
to
the
united
states
--
i'm
sorry,
if
i
was
getting
a
question.
so
it's
basically
piling
further
gender-related
inferences
on
top
of
the
ones
that
are
already
in
place
in
order
to
serve
to
justify
this
distinction.
now,
with
respect
to
the
fiallo
case,
there
is
a
tradition
of
allowing
citizens
to
transmit
citizenship.
fiallo
involved
getting
aliens
into
the
united
states.
there
is
no
tradition
that
dates
back
to
1350
where
citizens
enjoyed
rights
to
bring
aliens
into
the
united
states,
but
it
does
date
back
to
1350
that
you've
been
able
to
confer
citizenship
on
your
foreign-born
children.
so
it
is
differently
situated
and
it
is
differently
situated
in
the
very
structure
of
the
statute
that
we
are
talking
about
today.
congress
very
specifically
eliminated
the
ability
of
courts
to
change
the
rules
of
naturalization
of
aliens.
it
basically
used
language
very
similar
to
the
courts
decision
in
ginsberg
and
said
that
you
can
be
naturalized
under
this
provision
and
no
other
way.
it
didn't
say
that
as
to
citizens
as
of
birth.
citizens
as
of
birth
are
treated
differently.
there
is
a
severability
clause
in
the
statute,
so
that
would
apply
to
them
and
that
brings
into
play
all
the
various
remedies
that
the
court
has
granted
with
the
respect
to
extension
over
the
years.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
i
agree
that
the
constitution
doesn't
guarantee
that
right.
our
point
is
that
it's
a
traditional
right
and
that
congress
has
always
provided
for
it
even
in
the
period
between
1802
and
1855
where
the
statute
was
strangely
drafted
and
didn't
provide
for
it.
this
court
made
clear
in
montana
v.
kennedy
that
when
congress
remedied
that
situation
it
made
that
remedy
retroactive.
so
basically
we
have
an
unbroken
tradition
dating
back
to
1350,
that's
why
i
think
that
this
right
should
be
treated
differently
than
the
questions
of
admissions
of
aliens
in
fiallo.
and,
again,
there
is
also
chadha
zadvydas
that
made
clear
that
the
constitution
limits
the
congress's
power
even
in
the
context
of
naturalization.
and
then
with
respect
to
the
third-party
standing
issue,
the
court
has
granted
third-party
standing
to
criminal
defendants
whose
are
raising
third-party
constitutional
issues
in
their
criminal
cases,
and
the
same
analysis
should
apply
here.
we
can
still
look
at
the
right
from
the
perspective
of
the
petitioner's
father
and
if
the
court
grants
a
levelling
down
remedy,
that
would
not
remedy
the
situation
the
petitioner's
father
would
be
in
because
both
before
and
after
the
court's
decision
the
children
of
women,
similarly
situated
women,
would
be
citizens
and
petitioner's
father's
son
would
not.
mr.
steven
f.
hubachek
campbell
&
powers.
those
are
both
cases
where
the
criminal
defendant
asserted
rights
of
--
in
one
case
it's
a
petit
juror
and
another
in
the
other
case
it
was
a
grand
juror,
and
there
were
discriminatory
preemptory
challenges
in
those
cases,
and
the
court
allowed
those
criminal
defendants
to
assert
those
constitutional
rights.
several
members
of
the
court
also
found
there
was
standing
in
miller.
kowalski
pointed
out
in
craig
v.
boren
that
there
is
a
very
forgiving
standard
when
third-party
rights
are
at
issue
in
the
case.
