justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
all
cases,
it
is
true
in
general,
but
there
are
people
who
don't
fit
the
mold.
so
a
stereotype
is
true
for
maybe
the
majority
of
cases.
it
just
means
that
you
say:
this
is
the
way
women
are,
this
is
the
way
men
are.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hubachek,
how
do
you
deal
with
the
argument
that,
really,
this
is
a
classification
where
the
unmarried
woman
is
being
favored,
because
the
unmarried
father
is
being
bracketed
with
the
married
couple?
so
it's
kind
of
like
matthews
v.
heckler:
the
woman
is
getting
a
special
favor
and
the
unwed
father
is
treated
like
most
people
who
married
--
couples
who
have
children.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
first,
can
we
be
clear
about
what
you're
saying?
i
thought
your
argument
was,
you
are
not
touching
married
couples.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
you
are
talking
about
equating
the
unmarried
father
to
the
unmarried
mother.
do
you
have
--
is
there
any
notion
of
how
many
people
we're
talking
about?
i
mean,
in
these
extensions
versus
the
normalization,
where
the
court
generally
extends
when
there
is
a
small
class
to
be
covered,
a
small
class
was
left
out,
and
in
a
large
class
is
already
covered.
and
the
reasoning
has
been:
well,
my
goodness,
congress
wanted
to
take
care
of
that
larger
class;
it
would
be
most
destructive
of
the
legislative
will
if
we
said
you
can't
cover
that
larger
class.
so
as
a
group
of
unmarried
mothers
as
against
unmarried
fathers,
do
--
do
you
have
any
notion
of
what
the
numbers
would
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hubachek,
i
think
the
chief
asked
you:
if
it's
an
equal
protection
violation,
then
the
court
just
says
it
violates
equal
protection,
but
whether
it
goes
up
or
down,
the
court
has
to
give
a
temporary
solution,
because
the
legislature
can't
be
convened
on
the
spot.
and
the
court
actually
did
go
through
that
exercise,
extension
versus
invalidation,
most
conspicuously
in
califano
--
westcott,
in
the
westcott
case.
it
says,
yes,
that's
what
we
have
been
doing
in
all
these
cases.
in
sarah
frontiero's
case,
we
didn't
say:
you've
been
discriminated
against;
congress,
you
fix
it.
we
said:
you
get
the
quarters'
allowance
that
up
until
now
has
been
available
only
in
male
officers.
and
in
wiesenthal,
the
father
got
the
same
child
and
care
benefits
as
the
mother.
so
the
court
was
making
a
decision
for
extension;
it
recognized
it
had
to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
he
is
a
united
states
citizen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
also
said
that
the
remedy
can't
be
complicated,
because
courts
are
not
set
up
to
do
that.
i
mean,
that's
what
westcott
said.
the
court
can
go
one
way
or
another
way;
it
can't
do
any
fine-tuning,
because
it's
there
as
a
temporary
legislature.
the
ball
goes
back
to
congress
to
do
what
it
will,
but
it's
just,
in
the
interim,
we
need
a
solution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
congress
did
make
at
least
some
change,
right?
it
--
this
is
--
it's
no
longer
five
years;
it's
only
two
years,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
well
established
test?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
first,
in
fiallo
we
were
dealing
not
with
citizens,
this
is
someone,
a
resident
--
could
be
a
resident
alien
wanting
to
bring
in
a
parent
or
a
child.
so
it
wasn't
--
that
case
wasn't
about
who
was
the
citizen
at
birth.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
congress
has
passed
--
has
passed
a
statute
making
certain
people
citizens
and
the
question
is,
has
it
done
so
in
a
way
that
is
compatible
with
equal
protection.
but
remind
me
too,
because
it's
not
in
the
front
of
my
head,
i
thought
that
classification
that
was
dealt
with
in
fiallo,
wasn't
it
unwed
parentage
rather
than
gender?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
if
--
if
the
classification
then
were
that
we
want
to
encourage,
because
it's
good
for
society,
father/child
relationships,
so
we
are
going
to
give
that
advantage,
that
is
1
year
for
fathers,
and
we're
going
to
put
the
mothers
together
with
the
married
couples,
would
that
be
compatible
with
equal
protection?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
told
you
what
the
rationale
was.
the
rationale
was
that
we
have
lots
of
statutes
like
the
family
medical
and
leave
act
that
attempt
to
encourage
fathers
to
have
a
relationship
with
their
children,
to
be
a
legal
parent,
so
that's
the
rationale
of
this
classification.
they
want
to
encourage
the
father/child
relationship,
therefore,
they
gave
this
1
year
is
enough
for
the
--
for
the
father.
and
everything
else
is
the
same,
except
it's
the
father
who
gets
the
1
year,
and
the
mother
who
gets
the
--
what
is
it,
10
years--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
it
would
you,
in
fact,
acting
on
the
basis
of
what
hasn't
been
the
general
pattern
but
what
is
becoming
the
new
pattern.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
is,
even
though
we
are
still
dealing
with
citizenship,
you
recognize
that
there
are
categorizations
that
would
run
afoul
of
equal
protection?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
same
as
in
the
family
medical
leave
act,
we
are
making
it
a
parental
leave
instead
as
if
it
had
been
historically
a
maternity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
in
answering
the
question
that
way,
i
know
you
are
familiar
with
the
wiesenfeld,
case,
and
the
question
was,
this
was
a
father
who
was
denied
benefits
to
take
care
of
a
--
a
child
whose
mother
died
at
childbirth.
and
the
court
came
out
a
unanimous
judgment
but
split
three
ways
on
why.
and
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
said,
this
is
discrimination
against
the
child,
even
though
the
classification
was
--
it's
called
a
mother's
benefit
--
it's
discrimination
against
the
child
because
it
should
make
no
difference
at
all
whether
the
missing
parent
is
female
or
male,
that
that
was
utterly
irrational.
that
was
the
chief
--
that
was
then
justice
rehnquist's
concurring
opinion
in
wiesenfeld.
so
he
seemed
to
think
that
the
discrimination
was
against
the
child
and
that
that
counted
for
equal
protection
purposes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
what
--
steven
wiesenfeld,
the
father
was
the
plaintiff,
but
the
court
--
at
least
one
justice's
rationale
was
that
the
discrimination
is
really
against
the
child,
but
the
father
can
raise
him--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
a
case
where
mother
versus
father.
but
here
it's
a
single
parent.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
father
is
doing
something
that
the
mother
regards
as
disadvantageous.
that
was
in
the
lehr
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
said
something
about
--
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
stereotypes,
this
is
the
way
the
law
was?
but
wasn't
the
law
shaped
because
of
the
vision
of
the
world
of
being
divided
into
married
couples,
where
the
father
is
what
counted,
and
unwed
mothers,
where
she
was
--
they
say
both
father
and
mother,
because
the
law
didn't
regard
him
as
having
any
kind
of
obligation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
nguyen,
i
thought
that
this
court
relied
on
the
biological
factor,
which
is
not
so
here.
i
mean,
here
there
is
no
question
that
this
is
the
--
the
natural
parent
of
the
child.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
in
answer
to
the
chief's
question,
you
know
--
i
mean,
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
raising
this
extension
versus
nullification,
and
in
every
one
of
them
the
court
did
make
a
choice.
it
didn't
say
well,
we
can't
make
any
choice.
even
in
the
one,
which
is
matthews
v.
heckler--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
court
did
make
a
choice
then.
it
was
the
rare
case
where
the
court
equalized
down.
but
i
don't
know
any
one
of
them--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
were
the
criminal
cases
where
there
was
--
where
the
defendant
was
permitted
to
raise--
