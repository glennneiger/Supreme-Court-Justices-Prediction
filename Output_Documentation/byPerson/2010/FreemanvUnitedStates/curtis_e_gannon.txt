mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
criminal
defendant
and
the
government
agree
to
a
specific
sentence
and
that
agreement
is
binding
on
the
sentencing
judge
by
virtue
of
rule
11(c)(1)(c),
the
resulting
sentence
is
based
on
the
parties'
agreement.
it
is
not
based
on
the
advisory
guideline
range
that
would
otherwise
have
been
used
at
sentencing,
even
if
the
sentence
corresponds
to
that
range.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
the
court
certainly
made
the--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
the
question--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
the
statutory
question
here
isn't
just
whether
the
sentence
is
based
on
the
guidelines.
the
language
under
3582(c)(2)
is
whether
the
defendant
was
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
based
on
a
sentencing
range
that
has
subsequently
been
lowered
by
the
commission.
so
it's
not
just
whether
the
guidelines
played
a
role;
it's
whether
this
particular
sentencing
range
was
what
was
driving
the
sentence.
and,
justice
kennedy,
you
point
out
pages
25,
26
of
the
plea
agreement
in
the
joint
appendix.
and
i
think
it's
instructive
that
the
agreement
deals
differently
with
the
fine
component,
as
justice
alito
referred
to
earlier,
than
it
does
with
the
term
of
imprisonment.
at
the
bottom
of
page
25,
the
agreement
says
that
a
fine
will
be
at
the
lowest
end
of
the
applicable
guideline
range.
and
then
if
you
go
over
to
pages
27
and
28
in
paragraph
11,
that's
where
the
guideline
calculation
occurs.
and
notice
it
is
an
incomplete
calculation.
the
parties
don't
actually
come
up
with
a
final
calculation
because
they
don't
come
up
with
a
criminal
history.
they
don't--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--they
--
they
come
up
with
a
recommendation
for
purposes
of
determining
the
offense
level,
the
base
offense
level
of
22
and
then
reduced
to
19.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
that
aspect
is
based
on
the
guidelines,
but
then
the
guideline
application
computation
is
incomplete
because
the
next
paragraph,
paragraph
b,
says
we
aren't
agreed
on
what
the
criminal
history
is
going
to
be.
and
to
the
next
paragraph,
paragraph
c
specifically
says
that
the
foregoing
statements
of
applicability
of
sections
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
are
not
binding
upon
the
court.
the
defendant
understands
the
court
will
independently
calculate
the
guidelines
at
sentencing;
that
is--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
justice
kennedy,
is
the
agreement
expressly
contemplates
that
the
judge
needs
to
determine
the
applicable
guideline
range
for
purposes
of
determining
what
the
fine
will
be.
and
that's
different
from
the
way
the
plea
agreement
deals
with
the
term
of
imprisonment
because
if
we
go
back
to
page
26,
it
does
not
tie
the
--
the
term
of
imprisonment
to
a
guideline
range.
that's
completely
different
from
the
way
it
deals
with
a
fine.
it
specifically
says
there's
an
agreement
that
the
sentence
of
106
months
of
incarceration
is
the
appropriate
amount.
and
so
that
happens
to
have
been
at
the
bottom
end
of
the
guideline
range
that
would
have
been
applicable
if
the
parties'
agreement
--
if
the
parties'
prediction
about
the
likely
criminal
history
calculation
turned
out
to
be
the
right
one.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
at
that
point
the
remedy
for
the
breach
would
be
that
the
united
states
is
relieved
of
its
obligations
under
the
agreement.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
think
that's
--
that's
part
of
the
problem
in
a
case
like
this
where
there
was
a
specific
sentence
agreement,
that
it's
impossible
for
government
to
get
back
the
things
that
it
gave
up
at
the
time,
that
were
agreed
to
under--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
but
it
also--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
--
that
would--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
don't
think
that
the
3582(c)(2)
contemplates
that
the
sentence
will
be
increased.
the
only
thing,
as
the
court--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that's
if--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--now
that
the
sentence
has
become
final,
i
think
3582(c)(2)
has
opened
a
narrow
window
for
ways
in
which
the
otherwise
final
sentence
could
be
modified.
it
only
contemplates
that
the
judge
will
have
the
discretion
to
reduce
the
sentence
if
it
is,
first,
a
sentence
that
was
based
on
the
relevant
guideline
range
that's
subsequently
been
amended
and
made
retroactively
applicable.
but
also,
second,
then
the
judge
would
need
to
comply
with
a
policy
statement
that
appears
in
1b1.10
of
the--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
the
remedy
that
the
agreement
contemplates
of
the
government
being
released
from
its
other
obligations
in
the
plea
doesn't
really
leave
us
much
of
an
option
at
this
point.
we're
not
going
to
be
able
to
go
back
and
argue
that
he
should
have
been
sentenced
at
the
upper
end
of
the
range
that
we're
talking
about.
we're
not
going
to
be
arguing
that
the
criminal
history
should
have
been
a
higher
or
that
the
criminal
history
substantially
underrepresented
the
seriousness
of
his
history
where
he
had
10
years
of
offenses
preceding
this
one.
there
may
have
even
been
a
potential
career
adjustment
that
--
that
went
by
the
boards.
that's
mentioned
on
page
162
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
think
the
agreement
is
arguably
--
i
mean,
i
don't
think
the
face
of
this
agreement
proves
that
it's
based
on
the
guidelines,
but
i
--
it
is
obvious
that
the
parties
negotiated
in
the
shadow
of
the
guidelines.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
it's
not
clear
that
the
judge
needed
to
be
considering
the
guidelines
in
the
course
of
deciding
whether
to
accept
the
plea
agreement.
and
justice
breyer
earlier
had
a
colloquy
with
mr.
heft
about
guideline
6b1.2,
which,
even
before
booker,
was
a
nonbinding
policy
statement.
and
so,
to
be
sure,
when
3582
was
enacted,
the
guidelines
were
binding,
and,
therefore,
it
--
they
would
have
been
expected
to
have
played
a
larger
role
in
most
sentences.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes.
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
think--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
there's
a
different
purpose
that's
being
served
by
asking
the
3582(c)(2)
inquiry,
which
is
asking
the
judge
to
--
to
go
back
and
redo
the
aspects
of
his
analysis
that
would
have
been
different
had
the
--
the
relevant
guideline
range
been
changed
at
the
time
he
engaged
in
his
analysis,
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--outside
of
the
context
of
a
specific
c--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it
is
--
the
test
that
we
state
in
the
subheading
of
that
section
of
our
brief
is
whether
they're
of
legal
consequence
in
the
determination.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
our
--
the.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
the
test
that
we
have
for
--
the
overarching
test
is
whether
it
is
of
legal
consequence,
and
the
phrase
that
you're
talking
about
on
page
27
of
our
brief,
justice
kagan,
is
when
we
know
that
there
is
something
that
was
of
binding
legal
consequence
and
was
controlling,
we
know
that
that
is
the
thing
that
the
sentence
was
based
on.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
that
is
--
in
--
when
something
literally
is
controlling
the
analysis
--
the
parties'
agreement
here
binds
the
district
judge
--
we
know
that
that
is
what
the
sentence
is
based
on.
there
isn't
any
--
any--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
it
would
be
of
legal
consequence
even
if
it
weren't
controlling.
this
court
has
--
has
made
clear
even
after
booker
that
under
3553(a),
courts
still
need
to
go
through
the
relevant
guidelines
analysis.
they
apply
the
guidelines.
it
may
turn
out
that
the
sentence
turns
out
not
to
be
based
on
the
relevant
guideline
range
because
the
judge--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
don't
think
that's
true
in
the
context
of
a
specific
sentence
agreement
under
a
type
c
plea
because
of
--
and
this
is
reinforced
by
the
language
in
the
policy
statement,
1b1.10,
which
the
court
last
term
in
dillon
held
is
binding
and
controls
what
needs
to
be
done
during
the
sentence
reduction
proceeding.
and
it
specifically
refers
to
the
guideline
provisions
that
were
applied
when
the
defendant
was
sentenced.
and
that's
something
that
happens
in
the
process
of
the
3553(a)
factors
applicability.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
--
i
understand
the
point
that
the
analysis
has
certainly
changed
since
booker,
but
it
is
still
the
case
that
the
defendant
can
appeal
an
error
in
application
of
the
guidelines
after
booker.
if
the
judge
were
to
--
to
misapply
the
guidelines
before
he
engages
in
the
analysis
that
you're
talking
about,
justice
alito,
that
would
be
grounds
for
an
appeal.
in
retrospect,
if
the
judge
is
asked
whether
the
sentence
was
based
on
the
guidelines,
he
--
he
may
say
that
particular
sentence
wasn't,
because
i
ended
up
disregarding
the
guidelines
under
3553(a).
i
did
the
analysis.
i
was
exercising
my
sentencing
discretion
the
first
time
around
under
3553(a),
and
the
guidelines
ended
up
not
being
the
basis
of
the
sentence.
and
that
is
not
something
that
is
an
option
in
a
type
c
plea
agreement,
because
there,
the
defendant
cannot
appeal
when
the
judge
agrees
to
the
sentences
in
the
agreement.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
think
in
the
context
of
an
actual
specific
sentence
plea
agreement,
that
is
the
one
that
we
think
is
off
the
table,
because
that
is
what
is
going
to
control
the
sentence.
and
some
type
c
plea
agreements
affirmatively
contemplate
application
of
the
guidelines,
as
this
one
does
with
respect
to
the
fine.
and
so
when
you
have
a
plea
agreement
that
tells
the
district
judge,
you
are
bound
to
apply
a
guideline
provision
once
you've
accepted
this
agreement,
we
haven't
taken
the
position
that
the
resulting
sentence
there
is
not
based
on
the
relevant
guideline
range,
but
that
is
not
what
is
going
on
here.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
--
i--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
the
answer
is,
it's
different.
but
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
post-booker
case.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
the
sentencing
proceeding
occurred
six
months--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--after
the
booker
opinion
came
out.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes,
but.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
disagree,
justice
breyer.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
think
that
had
the
sentencing
commission
adopted
such
a
position,
and
if
it
were
binding
on
the
sentencing
judge--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--which
is
--
well,
because--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--before
booker
was
decided,
it
--
several
of
the
circuits
had
already
concluded
that
a
judge
could
accept
a
type
c
plea
agreement
that
had
a
sentence
outside
the
range,
and
that
that
wasn't
a
guidelines-based
sentence.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
think
in
those
circumstances,
the
commission
effectively
would
have
repealed
type
c
plea
agreements,
because--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--in
your
hypothetical,
that
is
what
they
wanted
to
do.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
in
those
circumstances
i
think
that
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
the
sentence
was
based
on
the
guideline
range--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--because
the
agreement
hadn't
given
any
reason
for
the
judge
to
--
to
leave
the
guidelines.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
6b1.2--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--is
on
the
last
page
of
the--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
it
differs
in
two
key
ways.
first
of
all--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it
is
on
the
last
page
of
the
government's
appendix
which
is
the
16a
of
our
brief.
and
i
think
that
it
differs
in
two
regards.
first
of
all,
it
--
it
was
a
policy
statement
that
even
before
booker
was
not
binding
on
the
sentencing
judge.
the
commission
determined
that
--
that
this
particular
guideline
was
not
binding
on
judges
the
same
way
other
provisions
in
the
guidelines
where.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
--
but
the
question
is
whether
the
judge
even
had
to
apply
it
at
all,
and
the
judge
did
not
need
to.
and
--
the
second
point
that
i
was
going
to
get
to
is
that,
unlike
the
colloquy
that
justice
breyer
had
with
mr.
heft
earlier
on,
it
doesn't
say
the
court
may
accept
the
agreement
only
if
the
court
is
satisfied
that
it
is
within
the
guideline
range.
it
gives
the
court
permission
to
accept
the
agreement.
this
is
a
policy
statement
that
gives
the
court
permission
to
accept
the
agreement
when
it
is
within
the
guideline
range
or
when
there
is
a
justifiable
departure,
but
it
does
not
then
say
that
everything
else
is
prohibited.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
this
is
for
6b1.3?
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i've
been
looking
at
a
text
of
6b1.2
itself,
which
leaves
out
the
word
only.
but
i
think
that
here,
even
if
you
go
back
to
the
pre-booker
practice,
i
think
it
was
clear
that
judges
were
able
to
depart
from
the
guidelines
to
accept
type
c
plea
agreements
that
imposed
the
sentence
that
was
outside
the
guideline
range,
and
they
--
and
it
wasn't
considered
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
--
i
do
think
that
--
that
this
gets
puzzling
as
--
as
you
get
further
down,
but
i
think
that
this
is
the
simplest
case.
it
is
a
narrow
category
of
cases.
we
are
dealing
with
a
subset
of
one
particular
type
of
plea
agreement.
it
is
distinct
from
every
other
aspect
of
federal
sentencing.
it's
unlike
what
happens
when
somebody
goes
to
trial;
in
those
circumstances
the
judge
clearly
has
the
discretion
to
apply
the
sentencing
guidelines
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
it
is
different
from
regular
type
b
plea
agreements
where
the
parties
have
come
up
with
an
agreement
and
the
judge
notwithstanding
the
agreement
is
still
free
to
determine
the
sentence
that
he
or
she
wants
to
determine.
this
is
a
unique
--
this
uniquely
gives
a
high
level
of
certainty
to
the
parties
about
the
specific
sentence
that
they
negotiated.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
because
i
think
that
the
relevant
question
for
purposes
of
both
3582(c)(2)
and
the
policy
statements
that
the
court
said
in
dillon
controls
the
--
the
process
of
implementing
3582(c)(2),
is
what
did
the
judge
do
at
the
time
of
imposing
the
sentence?
and
so
although
it
is
true
that
the
judge
generally
will
consider
how
the
type
c
specific
sentence
that
the
parties
have
agreed
upon
corresponds
to
a
guidelines
analysis
at
the
time
of
deciding
whether
to
accept
the
plea
agreement,
the
relevant
phrase
in
1b1.10(b)1
which
is
--
which
is
on
page
8a
of
the
government's
appendix
is
that
the
judge
is
supposed
to
go
back
and
look
at
what
--
to
only
make
substitutions
for
the
corresponding
guideline
provisions
that
were
applied
when
the
defendant
was
sentenced.
and
so
when
you
have
a
type
c
plea
agreement
that
has
a
specific
sentence
even
under
the
terms
of
this
agreement,
the
only
thing
that
the
judge
considered
when
he
decided
the
sentence
was
going
to
be
106
months
with
respect
to
the
term
of
imprisonment
was
the
binding
plea
agreement.
that
is
what
rule
11(c)(1)(c)
required.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
it
was--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--and
had
he
done
that
the
sentencing
proceeding
would
have
proceeded
differently
and
it
may
not
even
have
right
occurred
then,
and
--
and
i
think
because
under
rule
11
if
he
was
rejecting
the
plea
agreement
and
--
and
the
106
months
that
the
parties
had
agreed
to,
he
would
have
to
give
the
defendant
the
right
to
withdraw
the
plea
at
that
point.
so
the
government
would
have
been
released
from
its
obligations;
the
parties
--
the
defendant
could
have
gone
to
trial.
he
could
have
--
he
could
have
continued
to
plead
guilty.
the
parties
could
have
come
up
with
a
type
plea
--
b
plea
agreement.
the
parties
may
have
asked
for
time
to
renegotiate
a
different
type
c
agreement.
we
do
not
know
what
would
have
happened
in
those
circumstances.
and
as
you
pointed
out
before,
justice
sotomayor,
this
is
not
about
asking
the
judge
to
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
parties
and
renegotiate
what
the
agreement
would
have
been
had
the
judge
decided
to
reject
it
the
first
time
around.
instead
3582(c)(2)
contemplates
a
limited
process
by
which
the
judge
will
reapply
those
provisions
of
the
guidelines
that
he
applied
the
first
time
around
and
--
and
make
the
substitution
that
is
now
called
for
by
the
retroactively
applicable
change.
but
here
because
the
judge
didn't
actually
make
that
application
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
the
judge
did
not
actually
have
to
apply
the
drug
quantity
table.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
because
for
purposes
of
the
term
of
imprisonment
the
judge
was
not
actually
applying
the
guidelines
at
that
point.
he
did
so
for
purposes
of
the
fine.
he
ended
up
actually
waiving
the
relevant
fine,
but
those
type
c
plea
agreement
here
called
for
the
judge
to
apply
the
guidelines
with
respect
to
the
fine
and
did
not
call
for
the
judge
to
apply
the
guidelines
with
respect
to
the
term
of
imprisonment.
he
knew
that
it
was
within
what
the
psr
had
calculated
as
the
guideline
range
and
he
concluded
that
that
was
the
applicable
guideline
range
which
he
needed
to
do
for
purposes
of
calculating
the
fine
and
other
things,
but
it
wasn't
actually
the
basis
for
the
sentence.
the
basis
for
the
sentence
was
the
plea
agreement
that
he
accepted,
and
there
it
was
the
parties'
agreement.
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
that
went
into
the
parties'
agreement
that
the
judge
does
not
have
the
wherewithal
to
reconsider
in
retrospect.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes.
and
that
specifically
contemplated
in
rule
11(c)
and
in
the
guidelines,
that
the
judge
may
postpone
acceptance
of
the
plea
agreement
until
after
the
presentence
report
is
prepared.
and
the
judge
did
do
that
here.
so
he
was
aware
of
what
the
psr
recommended,
but
once,
and
had
he
decided
that
he
did
not
like
the
106
month
sentence
and
he
wanted
to
preserve
his
sentencing
discretion,
the
option
at
that
point
was
to
have
rejected
the
plea
agreement,
at
which
point
the
parties
would
have
been
free
to
do
different
things.
and
among
other
things,
the
government
could
then
have
then
argued
for
a
higher
sentence
within
the
range.
could
have
argued
that
the
criminal
history
failed
to
represent
the
seriousness
of
the
defendant's
criminal
past.
could
have
argued
for
an
upward
departure
even,
but
the
defendant
got
the
benefit
of
the
106
month
agreement
of
not
having
the
government
raise
any
of
those
other
arguments
at
that
time.
and
now
he
is
asking
for
essentially
another
bite
of
the
apple
and
we
think
that
because
the
basis
for
the
sentence
was
indeed
the
negotiation
and
the
agreement
between
the
parties,
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
correct.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
