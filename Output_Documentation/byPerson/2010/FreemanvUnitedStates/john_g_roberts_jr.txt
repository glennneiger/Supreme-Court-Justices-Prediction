chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-10245,
freeman
v.
united
states.
mr.
heft.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
--
if
we
issue
an
opinion
and
we
analyze
the
statute's
language,
the
statute's
purpose,
and
the
statute's
legislative
history,
would
the
opinion,
the
judgment
be
based
on
each
of
those
or
--
or
not?
in
other
words,
does
everything
that
goes
into
the
final
determination,
would
you
say
that
determination
is
based
on
each
of
those
factors
individually?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
my--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
my
question
goes
in
a
different
direction.
this
plea
agreement,
i
think,
could
be
said
to
be
based
on
the
sentencing
guidelines,
but
it
is
also
based
on
the
agreement.
in
other
words,
the
combination
of
the
two
of
them
is
what
gives
you
the
--
the
sentence.
so
how
can
you
say
it's
based
on
only
the
sentencing
guidelines
when
it
may
not
have
been
imposed
in
the
absence
of
the
plea
agreement?
probably
wouldn't
have
been.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
are
you
saying
the
plea
agreement
was
based
on
the
fact
that
he
was
caught
with
--
with
two
guns
rather
than
four
guns?
would
you
be
willing
to
say
that?
in
other
words,
everything
--
your
position,
it
seems
to
me,
could
be
criticized
for
saying
everything
that
contributes
to
the
final
106
months,
that
that
sentence
is
based
on
every
one
of
those
things--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--which
makes
the
--
which
makes
the
statutory
language
largely
mute
on
this.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
also
based
on
things
that
are
not
reflected
in
the
guidelines.
you've
got
a
particular
u.s.
attorney
who
is
more
lenient
in
prosecuting
these
types
of
crimes
than
another
one.
the
fact
that
you
got
the
minimum
under
the
guidelines
might
be
based
on
that.
it's
based
on
the
fact
that
this
person
felt
he
could
handle
106
months
in
prison,
and
he
wasn't
willing
to
risk
whatever
the
top
--
what
was
the
top
sentence
under
the
guideline
calculation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
he
figures
it's
better
for
me
to
get
--
it's
based
on
his
decision
that
i
--
106
months
is
better
than
the
risk
of
117.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
sentence
would
he
have
gotten
if
he
were
just
sentenced
under
the
guidelines,
no
plea
agreement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
guidelines
give
you
a
range.
the
judge
might
have
given
him
117
months.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know.
i'm
putting
aside
the
plea
agreement.
what
would
he
have
gotten
under
the
sentencing
guidelines?
we
--
we
don't
know,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
no
plea.
he
is
convicted
at
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
can
you
say
that
this
is
based
on
the
guideline
range
when
the
guideline
range
would
not
have
been
determinative?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
know,
but
my
hypothetical
is
in
a
different
context.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gannon.
mr.
heft,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
