mr.
heft,
would
you
require
those
kinds
of
statements
in
the
agreement
or
in
the
colloquy
in
order
to
satisfy
the
standard?
suppose
those
statements
just
didn't
exist.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
heft,
that
seems
very
complicated.
you
have
to
look
at
everything
and
you're
not
giving
us
a
lot
of
guidance
as
to
what
you
do
when
you
--
when
you
see
these
things.
i
mean,
this
sort
of
case-by-case,
all-things-considered
approach
just
seems
as
though
you're
going
to
get
a
lot
of
inconsistent
decisions.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
suppose--
justice
elena
kagan
defining
mr.
gannon--
justice
elena
kagan
--it's
not
a
binding
legal
consequence
post-booker.
justice
elena
kagan
so
that's
not
your
test.
what
is
your
test
instead?
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
but
is
--
is
there
some
other
instances
in
which
you
would
say
that
something
is
based
on,
even
though
it's
not
of
binding
legal
consequence?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
then
i'm
back
with
justice
scalia,
because
if
it's
only
of
legal
consequence,
not
of
binding
legal
consequence,
if
it's
something
that
somebody
considers
rather
than
something
that
is
determinative,
it
seems
to
me
the
same
in
the
non-plea
context
and
in
the
plea
context.
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
thought
you
just
told
me
that
--
binding
--
was
not
a
part
of
the
test
anymore.
