justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry,
i
don't
understand
that.
don't
the
guidelines
provide
for
departures?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
--
and
aren't
you
giving
a
guideline
sentence,
if
you
give
your
reasons
as
is
required
by
the
sentencing
commission
in
6b1.2
and
you
say
--
the
judge
says,
i
think
this
is
a
special
case
and,
therefore,
i
am
giving
a
lower
sentence?
just
as
he's
required
to
do
under
the
guidelines
in
order
to
accept
a
c
type
agreement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
could
it
not
be?
wouldn't
the
judge
have
to
say
it's
not
tied
to
the
guidelines,
because
i
am
varying
and
i
no
longer
wish
to
apply
the
guideline?
if
he
doesn't
say
that,
isn't
he
applying
the
guideline?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whether
he
gives
the
specific
robbery
3-point
whatever
it
is,
17
months,
or
whether
he
says,
i
have
a
special
case
and
i
depart
under
section
5
of
the
guidelines.
both
of
those
are
guideline
sentences,
aren't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
why
you
resist
that.
i
mean,
that's
precisely
what
the
guidelines
say.
the
only
ones
that
aren't
guideline
sentences
are
--
are
dismissal
charges,
where
it's
an
agreement
to
dismiss.
but
a
type
b,
type
c
--
the
guidelines
themselves
say
that
the
judge,
here's
what
you
do.
judge,
you
look
and
see
if
the
guidelines
sentence
is
there.
is
it
a
guideline
sentence?
if
it
is,
you
can
approve
it.
if
it
isn't,
you
can't.
i
mean,
that's
my
reading
of
what
it
says.
so
--
so
why
do
you
resist
that
conclusion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
of
course,
the
judge
now
could
depart
from
the
guidelines
--
i
mean,
"vary",
whatever
that
word
--
technical
word,
is
--
"vary".
he
can
say,
i'm
not
going
to
apply
the
guidelines
at
all.
but
if
he
is
going
to
apply
the
guidelines,
isn't
that
what
they
tell
him
to
do?
i've
always
thought
that.
you
may
tell
me
i'm
mistaken.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
could
it
not
be,
since
the
judge
has
no
power
if
he
is
to
apply
the
guideline--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
accept
any
agreement
other
than
agreement
that
corresponds
with
the
guideline?
that's
what
it
says.
it
says
the
court
should
accept
a
recommended
sentence
or
a
c
--
the
specific
sentence
--
only
if
the
court
is
satisfied
either
that
it
is
within
the
applicable
guideline
range
or
if
it's
based
on
a
departure
under
the
guidelines.
that
seems
to
me
what
it
says.
isn't
that
what
it
says?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
if
that's
so,
every
sentence
is
--
you're
going
to
say
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
thought
that
was
helping
you,
but
if
you
want
to
say
no,
go
say
no
and
explain
why
that
is.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
give
me
an
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
we
supposed
to
psychoanalyze
the
judge?
the
judge
says
on
his
writing,
checks
the
box:
this
is
a
guideline
sentence.
it
is
robbery.
it
is
precisely
within
the
robbery
range.
but
i
--
i
am
going
to
give
it
the
low
end
of
the
range
because
i
believe
that
the
--
he
has
a
lovely
mother
and
family
and
so
forth.
okay?
you're
saying
that
isn't
based
on
the
guideline.
no?
okay.
is
that
the
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
he
does
is
he
applies
the
guideline
sentence.
he
has
to
do
that.
now,
within
that
range,
he
has
applied
the
guideline
sentence,
he
got
the
information.
he
says,
i
am
satisfied
it
applies
--
done.
now
are
we
supposed
to
look
further
and
say
what
his
true
reason
is?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
were
--
you
were
just
at
the
very
point
when
we
decided
booker,
is
that
right?
it
was
--
your
--
your
sentencing
took
place
in
july
2005
and
we
came
out
with
booker
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so
it's
quite
possible
the
judge
wasn't
totally
--
but
i
mean
--
i
agree;
it's
much
more
complicated
after
booker.
i
don't
know
how
to
treat
yours.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
on
the
cusp.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you
want
us
to
decide
this
case.
i
completely
agree
with
what
justice
alito
is
saying,
justice
scalia,
that
maybe
the
world
after
booker
is
different.
and
i
have
not
thought
that
one
through.
i
am
thinking
this
case
is
a
pre-booker
case.
it
is
not
real.
i
am
thinking
it
is
on
the
cusp,
so
how
am
i
to
treat
this
case?
if
it
is
a
case
where
the
guidelines
apply,
if
it
is
such
a
case
--
and
i
think
maybe
everyone
here
has
assumed
throughout
that
it
was.
am
i
right
about
that?
were
you
saying
this
is
a
case
where
the
guidelines
do
not
apply,
where
they
are
not
binding?
i
mean,
where
pre-booker
doesn't
count?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
want
us
to
take
this,
pre-booker
or
post-booker?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
you
think
the
--
i
think
it
is
completely
different
regardless.
so
let's
avoid
that
controversy
at
the
moment,
and
you
tell
me
whether
you
want
me
to
take
it
pre-booker
or
post-booker.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so
you
want
to
--
you
want
to
set
aside
this
post-booker?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
perhaps
we
should
have
the
pre-argument.
if
we
are
taking
this
pre-booker,
i
would
have
thought
it
is
qed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
imagine
that
the
that
the
sentencing
commission
--
imagine.
it
is
not
true,
but
imagine
that
the
sentencing
commission
had
written
the
following
words:
"plea
bargaining
over
sentences
is
above.
"
as
many
argued
they
should.
they
write
those
words.
then
they
write
the
next
word,
"exception".
there
is
an
exception,
however;
you
are
permitted
to
plea
bargain
about
a
sentence
insofar
as
you
argue
about
the
range,
where,
within
the
range,
it
applies.
and
of
course
when
you
apply
the
guidelines,
as
when
you
always
apply
the
guidelines,
here
or
elsewhere,
departure
is
an
unusual
case.
now,
suppose
those
were
the
words
that
the
commission
had
written.
could
--
how
--
is
it
possible
under
those
circumstances
you
would
still
be
arguing
this
sentence
under
the
--
plea
bargaining
abolished
except
over
where
within
the
range
--
is
it
possible
you
would
be
arguing
that
this
is
not
based
on
the
guidelines?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
it
is,
because
of
(a)(4).
it
used
to
be--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
it
says
in
the
sentencing
guidelines,
judge,
you
will
apply
the
guideline,
unless
you
find
a
circumstance
the
commission
did
not
adequately
take
into
account
and
in
respect
to
that,
you
may
and
must
consult
policy
statements,
but
guidelines
and
other
materials.
that
is
what
it
says.
okay?
so
take
i
am
right
on
that.
assume
i
am
right.
you
can
disagree
with
me,
and
i
will
look
into
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
an
answer
to
my
hypothetical,
because
i
am
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
think
about
it,
and
you
will
help
me
if
you
answer
my
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
right.
that's
what
they
wanted
to
do.
okay?
now,
that
is
correct.
but
you
can
still
have
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
still
have
them,
but
they
allow
them
only
for
the
purpose
of
where
within
the
range
the
sentence
will
lie.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
now
i
would
like
--
because
if
they
wrote
those
words,
c
agreements
are
abolished,
but
for
where
within
the
range
--
okay?
you
agree
it
would
be
based
on
the
guidelines.
now
what
i'd
like
you
to
do
is
to
look
at
section
6b,
whatever
that
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
tell
me
how
this
differs
from
what
i
just
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
only
if.
the
words
there
are
"only
if".
it
said
should
accept
the
recommended
sentence
or
a
plea
agreement
requiring
imposition
of
a
specific
sentence
only
if
the
court
is
satisfied
either
that
such
sentence
is
appropriate
within
the
guidelines,
or
departure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am?
i'm
reading
6b1.3,
i
am
reading
commentary
on
the
policy
statement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
i
am
reading
the
commentary
on
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
you're
right.
you
see
that
is
why
i
am
having
such
a
hard
time.
i
am
having
a
hard
time
because
first
i
put
myself
back
in
the
commission
days,
and
there
the
commission
did
want
to
abolish
c.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
that
is
what
it
intended
to
do
and
that
is
what
it
said
it
did,
but
for
what
we
are
talking
about.
now,
you
first
raised
the
question
of
did
they
have
the
authority
to
do
that
and
i
agree
with
you
that
that
is
a
legitimate
question.
i
made
you
assume
it
away,
but
i
think
it
is
a
legitimate
question.
now
we
have
the
additional
question
of
how
booker/fanfan
changes
that
and
for
what
and
when.
do
you
see
why
i
am
puzzled
and
why
i
was
asking
you
rather
harshly
to
start
with
my
hypothetical?
