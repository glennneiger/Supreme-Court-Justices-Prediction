justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
quote
one
definition
of
--
the
noun
"base"
in
your
brief
uses
a
point
from
which
something
can
develop,
but
you
omit
another
standard
definition
of
the
term,
the
principal
element
or
--
or
ingredient
of
anything,
considered
as
its
fundamental
part.
why
do
you
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there's
two
--
there
are
two
different
definitions.
one
is
something
that
provides
a
starting
point
for
analysis.
the
other
is
the
fundamental
thing
on
which
something
is
--
it
rests.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
if
you
use
the
latter
definition,
you
have
to
decide
which
is
more
fundamental
here,
the
agreement
between
the
parties
or
the
sentencing
guidelines,
which
certainly
provided
the
starting
point
for
the
analysis
of
the
sentence
by
the
--
by
the
district
court.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
wouldn't
the
guidelines,
even
in
that
situation,
provide
the
starting
point
for
analysis?
isn't
the
district
court
obligated,
and
isn't
the
--
doesn't
the
presentence
report
have
to
go
through
the
guidelines
calculation
before
the
sentence
is
imposed?
so
you
start
out
with
the
--
the
guideline
sentence
of
whatever
the
figure
was
that
you
mentioned,
and
then
you
go
from
there,
and
maybe
you
depart
downward.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
why
wouldn't
that
be
based
on
the
guidelines?
just
because
there's
such
a
big
downward
departure?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
every
case,
they
have
to
go
through
the
guidelines
calculation,
and
the
parties
have
the
opportunity
to
object
to
the
calculation,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what
does
paragraph
12
of
the
plea
agreement
contribute
here,
other
than
with
respect
to
the
fine
and
things
besides
the
sentence
that
we're
talking
about?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
add
anything
substantively.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
there
had
been
evidence
here
of
that?
what
if
the
government
in
connection
with
this
plea
agreement
had
dropped
counts
or
had
decided
not
to
seek
a
superseding
indictment
adding
counts?
would
--
would
the
situation
be
the
same?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
would
that
possibly
work?
let's
say
the
government
drops
count
--
agrees
to
a
plea
on
count
1
with
a
guideline
range
of
60
to
65
months;
drops
count
2,
which
would
have
increased
the
guideline
range
to,
let's
say,
100
to
105
months;
and
says
this
is
our
deal,
you
know,
you
agree
to
--
to
65
months
and
we're
going
to
drop
count
2.
all
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
then
the
guideline
for
that
is
lowered,
and
you
say
in
determining
whether
the
defendant
is
eligible,
what
--
the
government
would
then
have
to
have
a
mini-trial
and
prove
that
the
--
prove
count
2?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
would
it
work?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
mr.
heft
--
guideline
range
would
be
reduced,
and
then,
as
the
district
judge
in
this
case
said,
if
you
have
objections,
let
me
know;
file
your
objections.
that's
where
the
government
could
file--
--yes.
the
government
files
its
objections
and
says,
well,
we
dropped
count
2.
and
the
defendant
says,
well,
i
wasn't
guilty
of
count
2.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
is
the
judge
going
to
decide
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
doesn't
this
line
of
questioning
lead
logically
to
the
conclusion
that
no
sentence
after
booker
and
fanfan
is
based
on
the
guidelines?
because,
today,
a
sentencing
judge
can
engage
in
the
same
analysis
that
the
sentencing
commission
may
engage
in
when
it
decides
that
a
guideline
range
should
be
lowered
and
that
that
should
be
retroactive.
the
judge
can
do
that
at
the
time
when
the
sentence
is
imposed.
we
roll
the
clock
back
on
the
crack
--
on
the
crack
cocaine
guidelines.
under
the
authority
that
judges
now
have
under
booker
and
fanfan,
a
judge
could
say,
well,
i
see
that
this
is
the
crack
cocaine
guideline
right
now,
but
i
think
it
is
too
harsh
for
all
the
reasons
that
were
later
persuasive
in
lowering
the
range,
and
therefore,
i
am
sentencing
below
the
range.
so
it
seems
to
lead
logically
to
the
conclusion
that
3582
is
yet
another
provision
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
that
was
tied
to
the
old
pre-booker
mandatory
sentencing
regime,
and
now
that
that
is
out
the
window
with
booker
and
fanfan,
the
whole
--
the
whole
mechanism
is
--
is
superfluous.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
find
it
hard
to
--
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
the
analysis
that
would
require
courts
to
decide
whether
some
(c)(1)(c)
plea
agreements
are
based
on
the
guidelines
and
some
are
not
based
on
the
guidelines.
maybe
they
are
all
based
on
the
guidelines,
and
then
the
obligation
would
be
on
the
government
to
put
a
provision
in
a
standard
plea
agreement
requiring
the
defendant
to
give
up
the
opportunity
to
move
for
a
sentence
reduction
if
the
guideline
range
is
subsequently
lowered.
or
maybe
none
of
them
are
based
on
the
guidelines
because
--
for
the
reasons
i
just
mentioned:
this
whole
mechanism
is
now
needed
no
longer
as
a
result
of
booker
and
fanfan.
