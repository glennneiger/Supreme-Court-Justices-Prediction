justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
here
the
agreement
at
various
points
says
that
the
parties
agree
on
the
calculation
of
the
guideline.
i
think
it's
paragraph
11
and
12.
they
say
that
the
sentence
is
according
to
the
guidelines.
so
there's
reference
to
the
guidelines
throughout,
and
the
court
made
the
guidelines
calculation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
seems
to
me
fair
under
the
statute
to
say
that
it
is
based
on
the
guidelines.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
agreement
you
might
argue
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
do
come
up
with
a
recommendation,
which
is
three
levels
below
the
otherwise
applicable
guideline.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
that's
all
based
on
the
guidelines.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
court
can't
base
its
conclusion
on
his
independent
--
on
its
independent
judgment
on
the
guideline.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
talking
about
what
"based
on"
means,
and
that's
an
important
part
of
your
argument.
if
i
could
just,
while
i've
got
you,
jump
to
this
question
of
what
happens
on
remand
if
you
lose
the
case.
on
remand,
i
take
it,
you're
not
bound
by
the
agreement
because
of
the
last--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
last
of
section
24
says
the
defendant
argues
for
any
sentence
other
than
the
one
to
which
he
has
agreed
to
and
breached
the
agreement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
--
what
would
that
mean?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
got
guilty
pleas
on
all
of
the
counts.
we
know
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
position,
in
your
view,
would
the
government
be
able
to
take
the
position
that
the
guilty
pleas
stay
in
place,
but
it
now
wants
maximum?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
maximum
guidelines.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
except
that
the
agreement
does.
the
agreement
relieves
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
any
obligation.
i
see
what
you
mean.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
say
the
judgment's
final,
so
the
fact
that
the
plea
--
that
there's
a
breach
of
the
plea
agreement
is
irrelevant
at
this
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
case
is
william
freeman
versus
united
states.
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984
calls
for
sentencing
guidelines
to
inform
judicial
discretion
in
federal
sentencing,
and
that
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
meaning
of
one
statutory
provision
in
that
act
in
its
18
u.s.c.
section
3582
(c)
(2).
the
statute
permits
defendants
who
were
sentenced
based
on
a
sentencing
range
that
has
since
been
amended
to
seek
a
reduced
to
sentence.
the
question
is
whether
a
defendant
who
enters
into
a
plea
agreement
that
recommends
a
particular
sentence
may
be
said
to
be
sentenced
based
on
the
guidelines.
if
so,
that
would
make
him
eligible
to
seek
3582
relief.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
william
freeman,
entered
into
a
plea
agreement
with
the
government,
and
the
agreement
recommended
a
sentence
of
106
months,
a
sentence
which
corresponded
with
the
bottom
of
--
then
applicable,
crack
cocaine
guideline
range.
the
district
court
accepted
the
plea
and
entered
the
sentence.
the
sentencing
commission
later
amended
the
crack
cocaine
guidelines
and
it
made
that
amendment
retroactive.
freeman
sought
a
sentence
reduction,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
freeman
was
sentenced
based
on
the
plea
agreement
rather
than
the
guidelines
so
it
held
he
is
ineligible
for
relief.
five
members
of
the
court
agreed
that
this
judgment
must
be
reversed.
now,
i've
written
the
plurality
opinion
joined
by
justices
ginsburg,
breyer
and
kagan.
now,
the
opinion
concludes
that
the
sixth
circuit's
categorical
bar
finds
no
support
in
the
statute
or
the
rule
governing
plea
agreements
or
in
the
guideline
policies
issued
by
the
commission.
in
the
plurality
--
plurality's
view
in
every
case,
the
judge
must
exercise
discretion,
framed
by
the
guidelines
to
impose
an
appropriate
sentence
regardless
of
whether
the
conviction
is
obtained
by
trial
or
by
plea.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
but
outlining
a
different
approach.
she
concludes
that
sentence
is
following
plea
agreements
that
bind
the
district
court
to
impose
a
particular
sentence,
are
based
on
the
agreement
rather
than
the
guidelines
but
whereas
here,
the
agreement
itself
ties
the
recommended
sentence
to
the
guideline's
range
that
a
defendant
may
seek
3582
relief.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
is
thus
entitled
to
seek
a
sentence
reduction
under
the
statute,
and
the
contrary
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
reversed,
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia,
thomas
and
alito
joined.
