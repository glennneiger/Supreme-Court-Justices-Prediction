isn't
it
enough
for
you
to
say
--
or
based
not
in
whole,
but
in
part
--
based
on,
something
could
be
based
on
several
things,
and
one
of
them
is
the
guidelines
that
then
existed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
heft,
are
you
relying
on
--
this
was
--
this
is
a
plea
agreement
that
said,
specifically,
defendant
agrees
to
have
his
sentence
determined
pursuant
to
the
guidelines,
and
then
the
judge
says
that
he
was
adopting
the
probation
report
and
the
application
of
the
guidelines
as
set
out
therein,
so
both
the
--
the
defendant
says,
i
agreed
to
a
determination
pursuant
to
the
guidelines,
and
the
judge
says,
i'm
going
to
apply
the
guidelines
in
giving
you
your
sentence.
so
the
hypotheticals
we're
talking
about
are
quite
far
afield
from
where
you
have
a
specific
statement
by
the
defendant
and
the
sentencing
judge
that
the
guidelines
are
being
applied.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
you're
talking
about
a
plea
agreement,
which
the
government
has
consented
to
whatever
this
agreement
is
and
whether
--
whether
--
sometimes
a
plea
agreement
will
say
okay,
if
you
take
a
plea,
we'll
drop
certain
charges
or
we'll
charge
a
small
amount
--
value
of
the
drug.
was
there
any
of
that
in
--
in
this
plea?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
that
event,
the
sweet
part
would
be
open
to
reconsideration
too.
i
mean,
you
can't
say,
i
want
the
good
part,
the
lowered
guideline,
but
i
also
want
to
keep
that
certain
counts
are
dropped
and
that
a
certain
quantity
of
drugs
was
agreed
upon.
you
would
have
to
reopen
the
whole
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
am
not
following
that
argument
for
this
reason.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
ask
what
did
the
judge
apply
at
the
time
he
imposed
the
original
sentence,
well,
it
has
got
to
be
the
guidelines,
because
first
the
agreement
provides
for
it;
then
he
says
i
am
going
to
wait
for
the
probation
report
so
i
can
see
what
the
calculation
is,
whether
i
agree
with
it;
and
then
he
gives
him
a
sentence
that
is
precisely
within
the
guidelines.
so
if
you
asked
me
to
describe
what
that
sentence
was
--
of
what
was
it,
46
to
106
days
--
i
say
that
was
a
guideline
sentence.
it
was
right
there
within
the
brackets
that
--
the
guidelines.
so
why
wasn't
it
a
guideline
sentence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
one
of
the
things
in
the
plea
agreement
was
that
the
--
that
the
judge
would
have
the
right
to
himself
calculate
the
guideline
range.
