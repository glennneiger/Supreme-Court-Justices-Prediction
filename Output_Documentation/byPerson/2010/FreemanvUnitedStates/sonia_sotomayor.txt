justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
could
you
--
maybe
it
would
be
easier
if
you
would
describe
to
us
the
situations
you
don't
think
would
be
based
on
the
guidelines.
the
solicitor
general
claims
that
since
every
plea
negotiation
has
to
start
with
the
guideline
calculation
as
a
starting
point
for
departure
and/or
consideration
by
the
judge
under
6b1,
that
every
c
plea
agreement
would
be
considered
based
on.
are
you
taking
that
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
i'll
give
you
a
couple
of
examples,
but
you
give
me
more.
would
a
plea
agreement
that
doesn't
mention
the
guidelines
at
all
but
picks
a
sentence
within
the
actual
guideline
--
is
that
based
on
the
guideline?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
and
how
about
one
that
departs
or
varies
from
the
guideline,
the
range,
whichever
word
you
want
to
use?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
--
the
solicitor
general
is
right;
there
really
isn't
any
situation
that
you're
claiming
is
not
based
on?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
give
me
the
examples.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
from
what
base
does
a
judge
depart
downward?
from
the
crack
cocaine
range
or
from
the
downward
departure
range?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
aren't
you
just
asking
us
to
permit
district
court
judges
to
make
up
their
own
c
agreement,
to
decide
what
the
parties
would
have
done
in
the
absence
of
a
higher
range?
and
don't
we
fall
prey
to
sort
of
just
asking
district
court
judges
to
create
their
own
agreements?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
don't
--
i
am
not
in
disagreement
with
the
point
you're
making,
but
i
think
that
going
back
to
what
had
bothered
justice
alito
and
justice
scalia
on
now
that
the
guidelines
are
not
mandatory,
is
any
sentence
even
under
c
really
based
on
the
agreement?
because
even
a
c
agreement
has
to
be
approved
by
the
judge.
the
legal
consequence
is
not
the
agreement.
that
doesn't
sentence
the
defendant.
it
is
the
judge's
decision
as
to
what
the
sentence
should
be
which
he
denotes
in
accepting
the
agreement
that
binds.
and
i
think
--
i
may
be
making
justice
breyer's
argument
--
that
if
under
the
policy
statement
and
it's
clear
what
the
judge
did
here,
if
the
judge
feels
bound
by
the
agreement
or
otherwise
to
calculate
a
sentence
in
the
guidelines
and
impose
one
in
the
guidelines,
how
can
you
say
that
the
legal
effect
is
not
the
guideline
sentence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--no.
because
you're
assuming
that
the
agreement
was
automatically
binding
on
the
judge.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
judge
was
always
capable
of
saying
at
the
time
of
sentence
i
won't
accept
the
106.
if
he
had
calculated
the
guidelines
and
if
it
turned
out
that
the
guidelines
called
for
240
to
360,
he
could
have
said
easily
no,
that
is
so
far
outside
of
the
guideline
range
with
no
justification
that
i
am
not
going
to
accept
--
impose
the
sentence.
you
could
withdraw
your
agreement
and
do
whatever
you're
going
to
do.
