justice
antonin
scalia
can
a
--
can
a
sentencing
judge
be
found
to
have
abused
his
or
her
discretion
in
approving
a
plea
--
a
c
plea
agreement
which
provides
for
less
than
the
minimum
guideline
sentence
and
gives
no
--
no
particular
reason
for
that?
would
that
be
appealed
as
an
invalid
sentence?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let
--
let
me
ask
my
question
a
different
way.
in
deciding
whether
to
approve
the
plea
agreement,
doesn't
the
judge
have
to
consider
whether
it
is
an
application
of
the
guidelines,
whether
it
is
wildly
inconsistent
with
the
guidelines,
whether
it
does
not
take
into
account
valid
reasons
for
departure
from
the
guidelines?
justice
antonin
scalia
then,
if
that's
the
case,
then
every
plea
agreement
is
based
on
the
guidelines,
every
single
one,
because
the
judge
always
has
to
consider
how
do
the
guidelines
apply
to
this
plea
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
incidentally,
and
it
sort
of
bears
upon
this
discussion,
are
the
guidelines
mandatory
when
they
are
applied
in
approving
a
plea
agreement?
in
other
words,
does
booker/fanfan
not
apply
to
the
application
of
the
guidelines
when
a
judge
is
--
is
approving
a
plea
agreement?
do
you
think
the
guidelines
are
mandatory
in
that
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
justice
alito's
hypothetical
points
out
--
points
up
the
fact
that
even
though
the
agreement
may
mention
the
guidelines,
it
may
do
that
just
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
--
the
judge
more
readily
to
approve
the
agreement,
but
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
government
is
interested
in
the
guidelines,
as
opposed
to
being
interested
in
putting
this
person
away
for
a
certain
amount
of
time,
especially
when
another
count
is
dropped
and
the
government
says,
well,
i'll
--
you
know,
i'll
drop
it
if
--
if
this
guy
goes
to
prison
for
2
years.
but
if
the
government
had
known
he's
not
going
for
2
years,
he
is
only
going
for
a
year
and
a
half
or
a
year,
the
agreement
might
not
have
been
concluded.
so
it
really
--
i
mean,
it
doesn't
further
the
intent
of
both
parties,
at
least,
to
say
when
the
guideline
is
changed,
the
agreement
changes.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gannon,
you
assert
that
the
--
within
the
language
of
the
statutory
provision,
the
sentence
here
is
not
based
on
the
guidelines,
but
it's
based
on
the
agreement,
and
the
agreement
arguably
is
based
on
the
guidelines.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
--
if
you
take
that
position,
that
"based
on"
means
determined
by
absolutely,
then
i
don't
think
any
sentence
would
ever
be
based
on
the
guidelines
after
booker/fanfan.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
guidelines
form
part
of
the
consideration
of
the
judge,
but
the
judge's
decision
is
not
based
on
the
guidelines.
just
as
here,
the
--
the
agreement
--
the
guidelines
form
part
of
what
produces
the
agreement,
so
also
they
form
part
of
what
produces
the
judge's
decision.
and
it
seems
to
me,
if
that's
going
to
be
enough
for
the
judge's
determination,
it
ought
to
be
the
same
for
the
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
let's
--
let's
assume
there
is
no
plea
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
have
a
judge
who
sentences
post-booker/fanfan.
now,
his
sentence
is
not
based
on
the
guidelines
any
more--
justice
antonin
scalia
--any
more
than
this
agreement
is
based
on
the
guidelines.
the
guidelines
are
one
of
the
things
that
he
must
take
into
account
and
does
take
into
account
in
determining
the
sentence.
now,
if
that
is
enough
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
this
statute
--
statutory
provision
applies
to
a
sentence
imposed
directly
by
a
judge,
it
seems
to
me
the
same
analysis
ought
to
apply
to
a
sentence
imposed
through
a
plea
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
--
you
acknowledge
that
"based
on"
covers
post-booker/fanfan
sentences
by
the
judge?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
mr.
gannon
--
a
specific
sentence
rendered
under
type
c
that
--
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
we
acknowledge
that
in
most
contexts,
it's
--
it's
open
to
--
to
contend
that
the
sentence
was
based
on
the
relevant
guidelines--
--even
though
--
even
though
the
guidelines
are
just
one
of
the
things
that
have
to
be
taken
into
account?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
were
about
to
tell
us
where
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
reading
a
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
is
reading
the
commentary.
