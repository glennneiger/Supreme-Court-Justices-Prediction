mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
william
freeman's
plea
agreement,
his
presentence
report,
and
the
sentencing
record
all
show
that
his
term
of
imprisonment
was
based
on
a
crack
cocaine
guideline
that
was
retroactively
lowered
by
the
united
states
sentencing
commission.
this
case
asked
the
court
to
decide
whether
the
fact
that
a
sentencing
court
accepted
a
plea
agreement
under
criminal
rule
11(c)(1)(c)
precludes
eligibility
for
a
sentence
reduction
under
section
3582(c)(2).
we
submit
that
mr.
freeman
is
not
barred
from
eligibility
for
a
(c)(2)
sentence
reduction
for
several
reasons.
first,
under
the
ordinary
definition
of
mr.
freeman's
term
of
imprisonment,
that
term
of
imprisonment
was
based
on
the
subsequently
lowered
guideline.
second,
the
categorical
ban
on
eligibility
adopted
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
advanced
by
the
government
frustrates
the
purpose
underlying
section
(c)(2)
and
finds
no
support
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
of
the
rule,
and
under
the
terms
of
mr.
freeman's
plea
agreement.
third,
a
record-based
analysis
that
reviews
the
plea
agreement,
the
presentence
report,
and
the
sentencing
record
to
determine
the
basis
of
the
sentence
is
--
is
best
suited
to
correctly
implement
section
(c)(2),
and
it's
--
that
record-based
analysis
supports
the
conclusion
that
mr.
freeman's
sentence
was
indeed
based
on
a
retroactively
lowered
guideline.
the
--
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--yes.
certainly,
it
is
based
--
the
determination
certainly
would
be
based
on
the
statute,
your
honor,
but,
as
we've
--
we've
argued
in
our
brief,
we've
asked
the
court
to
take
what
we
believe
to
be
a
record-based
analysis
and
look
at
--
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
look
at
the
terms
of
the
plea
agreement,
look
at
the--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
believe
that
that's
mutually
exclusive.
a
sentence
can
be
a
guideline
--
a
sentence
based
on
the
guidelines,
and
it
can
be
a
sentence
based
on
a
c
plea
agreement.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
the
dictionary
definition
that
we've
given
encompasses
the
definition
that
your
honor
has
just
--
just
described.
the
--
and
our
position--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--well
--
well,
our
contention
is--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--justice
alito,
that's
correct.
the
guidelines
certainly
were
the
starting
point,
but
they
were
also
the
principal
foundation
of
this
agreement
because
what
the
agreement
is--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--certainly.
certainly.
and
this
--
this
plea
agreement
reflects
that
it
was
based
on
the
guidelines.
if
you--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--well--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
sentence
is
based
on
a
number
of
guidelines.
each
--
no
sentence
is
based
on
just
one
guideline,
as
this
plea
agreement
reflects.
it's
based
on
a
compilation
of
guidelines.
it's
--
it's
based
on
the
crack
guideline,
and
as
prior--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--it
would
have
been
117
months.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well,
certainly
there
are
a
number
of
factors
that
go
into
plea
bargaining
and
negotiation,
but
what
--
i
think
what
the
court
has
to
look
at
is
what
is
said
in
that
plea
agreement.
and
i
think,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
a
minute
ago,
the
definition
of
"based
on"
--
if
a
guideline
sentence
is
--
if
a
sentence
is
based
in
part
on
the
guidelines,
that
would
be
adequate
under
the
--
under
section--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--he
would
have
got
the
--
he
would
have
received
the
same
sentence,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--but
--
but
the
plea
agreement
here
was
for
the
bottom
of
the
guidelines.
the
parties
calculated--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--it
would
have
been
left
--
left
--
well,
assume
it
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
plea,
your
honor.
you're
talking--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--it
would
be
somewhere
within
that
guideline
range.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well
--
well,
we're
looking
--
we're
looking
at
the
content
of
the
plea
agreement,
your
honor.
the
--
the
plea
agreement
says--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--but
even
--
even
at
that,
your
honor,
if
--
that
sentence
ultimately
is
going
to
be
based
on
a
guideline
range,
and
if
that
guideline
range
is
subsequently
lowered
by
the
sentencing
commission,
then
the--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
absolutely
not.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
possibly,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
your
honor,
the
--
the
sentencing
commission,
in
1b1.10
note
3,
says
that
a
below-guideline
sentence
can
be
based
on
the
guidelines.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
oh
--
oh,
no,
your
honor.
there
are
--
there
are
c
pleas.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
all
right.
well,
first
of
all,
we've
cited
cases
in
our
brief
where
circuit
courts
have
determined
that
a
c
plea
was
not
based
on
the
guidelines.
but
let
me
give
you
another
example.
let's
just
assume
the
guideline
range
is
something
like
151
to
188
months,
and
then
--
but
the
parties
agree
to
a
sentence
of
60
months,
and
they
do
that
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
maybe
the
defendant
is
elderly.
maybe
the
defendant
has
serious
medical
conditions.
maybe
the
defendant
has
--
was
sexually
abused
as
a
child.
if
those
are
the
factors,
if
that's
the
reason
why
the
defendant
got
that
--
received
that
60-month
sentence,
that
sentence
is
not
based
on
the
guideline
range.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that
--
that's
true.
the
--
the
guidelines
would
be
the
starting
point
of
any
negotiation,
but--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--it
--
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
based
on
the
guidelines
if
those
other
factors
were
the
motivating
reason
for
the
imposition
of
the
sentence.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
if
the
parties
can
show
that
the
sentence
is
tied
to
the
guidelines.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
in
that
instance,
he
would
be
--
he
would
be
applying
it.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
if
the
--
if
the
judge
were
to
take
--
were
to
actually
apply
those
guidelines
and
say,
based
on
that
guideline,
i
am
going
to
depart,
that
sentence
is
based
on
the
guidelines.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
agreement,
your
honor.
it
may
very
well
depend
on
--
the
judge
may
depart
from
the
crack
cocaine.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no
--
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that's
--
that's
not
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
at
all.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
we've
asked
the
court
not
to
take
a
categorical
approach
to
this
issue,
but
to
take
either
a
case-by-case
approach
or
a
record-based
analysis,
to
allow
the
district
judge
to
determine,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
what
our
--
you
know,
what
is
the--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--that's
certainly
problematic,
justice
kagan.
if
those
--
if
there
was
nothing
in
that
plea
agreement
to
tie
the
sentence
to
the
--
the
sentence
--
the
agreed
sentence
to
the
guidelines,
that
certainly
would
be
problematic.
but
that
doesn't
resolve
the
issue
one
way
or
the
other,
because
the
judge
would
have
to
consider
the
presentence
report
to
see
if
there's
a
connection
or
correlation
between
the
agreed
sentence
and
the
guidelines,
and
also
the
judge
could
look
at
the
guilty
plea
colloquy
and
sentencing
transcript
to
see
if
the
attorneys
actually
expressed
their
intent
about
where
this
sentence
came
from.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
respectfully,
your
honor,
i
disagree.
i
think
this
is
what
district
judges
do
all
the
time,
not
just
in
the
context
of
a
c
plea,
but
a
b
plea
as
well.
they
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
plea
agreement.
they
have
to
look
at
the
psr.
they
have
to
look
at
the
sentencing
transcript
to
--
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
--
is
eligible
for
that
sentence
reduction.
so
judges
are
doing
this
routinely.
they're
doing
this--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i
--
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
does,
justice
alito.
i
think
it
does
add
--
it
adds
substance,
and
it
adds
meaning
to
that
plea
agreement
because
in
paragraph
11
where
the
parties
very
meticulously
go
through
the
offense
level,
tie
that
to
the
guidelines,
and
then
--
then
they
state
in
paragraph
12,
the
--
the
defendant
agrees
to
be
sentenced
pursuant
to
the
--
to
the
guidelines.
that's
very
clear
that
the
review
in
the
guideline
calculation
is
what
the
sentence
is
based
on.
and--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
under
--
under
section
3742,
the
government
could
--
could
appeal
an
incorrect
application
of
the
guidelines
if
that's
what
your
honor
is
referring
to.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
freeman
pleaded
guilty
to
all
charges
in
the
indictment.
the
parties
stipulated
the
amount
of
--
of
drugs
that
were
found
on
his
person
when
he
was
arrested.
so
there
were
no
dismissed
charges,
no
amended
charges
in
this
plea
agreement.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes.
the
judge
would
have
to
consider
the
guidelines.
right.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
consideration
of
the
guidelines
alone
is
not
enough
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
sentence
is
actually
based
on
them.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--they
--
they
do;
obviously
they
do
consider
the
guidelines,
but
then
the
other
question
is
whether
or
not
the
sentence
is
based
on
those
guidelines--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--well--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--that
is
what
it
says,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--no.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
your
honor,
to
go
back
to
the
point
that
justice
sotomayor
made--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--with
the
hypotheticals,
there
still
can
be
c
pleas
that
are
not
based
on
the
guidelines.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well,
the
example--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--well,
the
example
that
i
gave
--
i
gave
previously.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
there's
a
guideline
range.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
but
the
judge
bases
his
decision,
his
or
her
decision,
solely
on
other
--
factors
other
than
the
guidelines.
as
i
mentioned
earlier--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--well,
it
depends
what
the
judge
does
at
sentencing,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
it
would
--
your
honor,
i
would
submit
it
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
--
the
plea
agreement,
whether
or
not
that
sentence
is
--
is
actually
based
--
going
to
be
based
on
the
guidelines.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
they're--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i
believe
it
was
march
of
2005.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes.
your
honor,
i
think
it
would;
it
would
be
the
same.
because
the
court
would
have
to
look
at,
again,
what
the
terms
of
the
plea
--
plea
agreement
was
and
what
the
parties
determined.
now,
the
--
i
think
what
i
should
emphasize
is
that
we're
only
talking
about
eligibility
here;
and
if
--
if
those
--
if
those
concessions
that
the
government
has
made
would
--
would
perhaps
result
or
at
least
in
the
government's
view,
result
in
an
unjustified
windfall,
that
--
that's
--
that
is
not
a
critical
factor
in
determining
eligibility.
that's
not
factor
at
all
in
determining
eligibility.
that
could
come
into
play
after
eligibility
is
determined
and
the
judge
--
district
judge
determines
whether
or
how
much.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no.
it
would--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--it
would
work
--
assuming
that
the
defendant
is
eligible,
the
case
is
remanded
to
district
court.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
as
in
this
case,
there
would
be
a
recalculation
of
the
guidelines
to
determine
if
the--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--that's
--
that's
up
to
the
district
judge's
discretion,
whether
or
not
to
--
to
reduce
that
--
that
amended
guideline
sentence.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well,
the
--
i
think
that's
something
that
district
judges
decide
every
day,
whether
or
not
--
because
the
judge
presumably
has
--
has
been
--
is
familiar
with
the
case,
with
the
presentence
report,
with
the
terms
of
the
original
plea
agreement,
with
the
facts
of
the
case;
and
the
--
and
the
judge
can
make
an
assessment
based
on
those
factors
whether
or
not
the
sentence
reduction
should
be
granted
and,
if
so,
how
much
of
a
reduction
should
be
granted.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well
--
well,
the
agreement
certainly
has
been
--
was
modified
by
the
amended
guideline,
and
that's
where
the
district
judge
has
to
exercise
his
or
her
discretion
whether
or
not
to
grant
that
reduction.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no,
your
--
no,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
think
you'd
have
to
reopen
the
case.
again,
i
think
the
judge
could
look
at
the
presentence
report,
the
government
could
make
its
objections
saying
here's
why
we
gave
that
particular
sentence,
and
the
judge
could
exercise
his
or
her
discretion
to
say
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
going
to
get
that
sentence
reduction.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
the
record
here
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
judge
based
his
sentence
on
the
guidelines.
the
sentencing
transcript
specifically
states
that
the
judge
and
i'd
like
to
quote
this,
this
is
at
page
47
of
the
joint
appendix
and
i
quote,
"the
court
will
adopt
the
findings
of
the
probation
officer
disclosed
in
the
probation
report
and
application
of
the
guidelines
as
set
out
therein.
"
on
page
48
of
the
joint
appendix
the
judge
says,
having
considered
the
advisory
guidelines,
he
went
on
to
impose
that
sentence.
so
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
judge
and
even
in
his
statements
of
reasons
on
page
95
of
the
joint
appendix,
again
reaffirmed
that
this
sentence
was
based
on
the
guidelines.
now,
the
other
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
the
government
acknowledges
that
it
has
carved
out
a
very
small
exception
to
its
argument
that
c
pleas
regarding
specific
sentences
and
sentencing
ranges
are
not
eligible
for
(c)(2)
relief.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
reading,
taking
the
government
position
into
account,
if
this
plea
agreement
had
not
stated
106
months,
then
mr.
freeman's
under
the
terms
of
this
plea
agreement
in
the
government's
view
and
under
the
government's
argument
of
what
exception
exists
under
the
c
pleas
for
purposes
of
3582,
mr.
freeman
would
be
eligible
for
the
relief
that
was
granted.
and
we
would
simply
urge
the
court
in
this
case
to
adopt
a
rule
that
does
not
exclude
specific
sentences
and
c
pleas
for
eligibility
in
3582.
thank
you.
