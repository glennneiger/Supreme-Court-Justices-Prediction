mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
justice
scalia,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
briefly
this
court's
decision
in
rca,
because
i
think
it's
important
to
notice
not
only
that
justice
cardozo
used
fulsome
and
extensive
language
that
was
intended
to
sweep
broadly
and
that
was
intended
to
announce
a
categorical
rule;
the
other
thing
is
the
discussion
in
rca
was
intended
and
was
set
forward
as
a
recapitulation
of
prior
doctrine.
that
is,
justice
scalia
--
justice
cardozo
did
not
purport
to
announce
for
the
first
time
a
rule
as
to
the
weight
that
should
be
given
a
prior
patenting
decision.
he
explained
that
this
is
what
the
court
had
done
since
the
latter
part
of
the
19th
century
and
in
fact
it
had
been
done
by
justice
story
riding
circuit
in
the
early
part
of
the
19th
century.
and
the
court
in
rca
said
a
patent
is
presumed
to
be
valid
until
the
presumption
has
been
overcome
by
convincing
evidence
of
error.
the
requirement
of
heightened
proof
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
presumption
itself
in
the
same
way
that
i
think
most
lawyers
in
this
country
would
say
that
the
requirement
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
presumption
of
innocence
in
criminal
cases.
if
a
new
criminal
statute
were
enacted
saying
that
the
defendant
is
presumed
innocent,
but
the
presumption
can
be
overcome
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
might
be
a
presumption
of
innocence,
but
it
wouldn't
be
the
presumption
of
innocence
as
it's
historically
been
understood
in
our
country.
the
second
thing
i
would
say
about
congress's
presumed
intent
when
it
acted
in
1952
is
that,
at
least
when
this
court's
precedents
are
clear,
congress
when
it
uses
words
that
come
right
from
those
cases
should
be
presumed
to
have
codified
this
court's
holdings,
not
the
decisions
of
lower
courts
that
may
have
deviated
from
this
court's
instructions.
and
i
think
the
presumption
that
congress
acts
against
the
background
of
existing
law,
it's
less
a
prediction
or
an
assessment
of
what
percentage
of
the
legislature
were
actually
aware
of
the
details
of
rca.
it's
more
a
method
of
making
the
system
work,
by
telling
conscientious
legislators:
if
you
do
read
up,
if
you
do
understand
the
contours
of
supreme
court's
decisions,
you
can
be
confident
that
your
words
will
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
there
is
a
belt
and
suspenders
quality
to
the
statute,
no
matter
how
you
parse
it,
but
i
think
that
microsoft
has
essentially
the
same
problem,
because
they
have
constructed
a
theory
under
which
the
second
sentence
does
something
that
the
first
has
not,
does
not,
but
they
haven't
constructed
any
theory
as
to
why
the
first
sentence
is
not
superfluous.
that
is,
given
the
second
sentence
to
the
effect
that
the
burden
of
establishing
invalidity
is
on
the
challenger,
there's
no
more
work
to
be
done
by
the
first
sentence.
the
other
thing
i
would
say
in
response
to
justice
alito's
question,
which
also
goes
to
the
natural
meaning
of
the
statute,
justice
alito
asked,
i
think,
basically,
if
these
precedents
were
not
on
the
book
and
we
were
just
looking
fresh
at
the
language,
what
would
we
assume
the
standard
to
be?
and
i
think
we
would
say,
let's
look
at
what
the
defendant
is
asking
the
judge
or
jury
to
do.
the
defendant
is
asking
the
judge
or
jury
to
set
aside
a
decision
that
has
been
made
by
then
the
patent
office,
now
the
pto,
and
we
would
ask
what
sort
of
standard
of
proof
ordinarily
applies
when
a
litigant
asks
a
court
to
set
aside
an
administrative
decision.
in
a
sense,
this
court
had
a
variant
of
that
problem
a
few
years
ago
in
dickinson
v.
zurko,
which
dealt
with
direct
court
of
appeals
review
of
a
denial
by
the
pto
of
a
patent
applicant's
application,
and
the
statute
clearly
authorized
judicial
review
in
the
federal
circuit,
but
said
nothing
about
what
standard
would
apply.
and
the
court
said
in
the
absence
of
a
conflicting
standard
imposed
by
the
statute,
we
will
look
to
background
principles
and
administrative
law,
and
the
standard
will
be
substantial
evidence.
and
that's
basically
what
this
court
said
back
in
1894
in
morgan
v.
daniels.
it
said
the
reason
that
we
apply
a
heightened
standard
when
an
individual
attacks
the
validity
of
an
issued
patent
is
that
that
litigant
is
asking
the
court
to
set
aside
a
decision
made
by
the
appropriate
executive
branch
agency.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
you
are
correct
that
if
congress
had
focused
specifically
on
the
category
of
cases
in
which
the
only
evidence
brought
forward
to
show
invalidity
had
not
been
considered
by
the
pto,
it
might
have
addressed
that
separately.
in
our
view
there
are
three
independent
reasons
that
it
makes
sense
to
apply
a
heightened
standard
even
in
that
category
of
cases.
the
first
two
have
to
do
with
the
interests
of
the
patent
applicant,
the
third
has
to
do
with
the
interests
of
the
pto.
the
first
one
is
that
the
patent
--
the
grant
of
a
patent
has
historically
been
understood
to
reflect
a
quid
pro
quo
between
the
applicant
and
the
government,
and
the
applicant's
part
of
the
bargain
was
disclose
that
which
might
otherwise
be
maintained
as
a
trade
secret,
and
the
government's
part
of
the
bargain
was
give
a
period
of
exclusivity.
and
i
think
there
is
a
thread
in
this
court's
cases,
especially
in
the
barbed
wire
patent
cases,
to
the
effect
that
once
the
patent
applicant
has
honored
his
part
of
the
bargain
a
court
should
be
hesitant
to
essentially
deprive
him
of
the
benefit
for
which
he
contracted
unless
the
evidence
is
clear.
the
court
in
the
barbed
wire
patent
cases
said
that
whatever
doubts
there
may
be
as
to
whether
the
patentee
was
actually
the
first
inventor
should
be
resolved
in
the
patentee's
favor
because
without
question
he
was
the
one
who
first
disclosed
the
information
to
the
public,
made
it
available
to
the
public
through
the
patent
application
process
itself.
the
second
is
related
to
the
patentee's
reliance
interests,
but
is
more
instrumental.
that
is,
independent
of
our
concerns
for
fairness
to
the
patent
applicant,
congress
could
reasonably
determine
that
there
are
enough
uncertainties
along
the
way
to
getting
a
patent,
to
having
it
overturned
on
various
other
grounds
that
in
an
invalidity
suit
the
patent
--
the
patentee
should
have
reasonable
confidence
that
it
won't
be
overturned
unless
the
evidence
is
clear.
and
i
would
like
to
respond
briefly
to
your
honor's
question,
justice
kagan,
about
why
isn't
that
diminished
by
the
re-examination
process.
i
think
it
is
diminished
somewhat.
re-examination
is
different
both
because
it's
done
by
the
expert
agency
and
because
it's
more
nuanced.
there
is.
the
option
to
narrow
the
claims
to
revise
the
language.
it's
not
a
blunderbuss
tool,
like
setting
it
aside.
but
i
would
still
acknowledge
the
force
of
your
observation
that
to
some
extent,
the
patent
holder's
confidence
would
be
greater
if
there
were
no
re-examination
process
at
all.
and
i
guess
i
would
say
this
is
just
one
aspect
of
the
patent
law's
balancing
of
competing
interests
in
a
way
that
doesn't
serve
either
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other;
and
to
use
an
obvious
analogy,
the
current
term
of
patent
protection
is
20
years
from
the
--
the
date
of
the
application.
obviously
congress
thought
20
years
was
better
than
10
and
presumably
that
was
because
20
years
gives
greater
incentive
to
innovation.
if
somebody
asked--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
not
fully
sufficient
to
resolve
all
challenges
to
the
--
the
validity
of
an
issued
patent.
now
congress
now
has
it
before
it
legislative
proposals,
one
of
which
has
passed
the
senate,
one
of
which
has
been
voted
out
of
committee
in
--
in
the
house,
and
is
currently
pending
before
the
court
--
the
full
--
full
house
of
representatives,
that
would
expand
the
availability
of
post,
what
we
now
call
post-grant
review
proceedings,
where
for
a
limited
window
of
time
after
a
patent
is
issued,
people
who
oppose
the
issuance
of
the
patent
can
come
in
and
object
on
any
ground.
and
that
wouldn't
be
limited
to
the
--
the
grounds
that
are
specified
in
the
current
re-examination
proceeding.
so
this
would
--
it
reflects
congress's
understanding
that
there
is
a
problem
with
patents
that
should
not
have
been
issued,
but
its
desire
to
create
additional
mechanisms
for
the
pto
to
address
that
problem,
rather
than
to
have
it
be
done
through
litigation.
but
that
--
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
about
the
20
and
the
10
years
is
somebody
could
ask,
well
if
20
years
is
better
than
10,
why
wouldn't
30
be
better
than
20?
and
the
only
answer
is
30
presumably
would
give
the
patentee
even
more
--
or
the
potential
patentee
even
more
incentive
to
invent,
but
at
a
certain
point
congress
decides
that
countervailing
considerations
require
an
end.
and
it
has
essentially
done
something
of
the
same
thing
with
re-examination.
it
said
we're
not
going
to
go
so
far
in
the
direction
of
protecting
patent
holders'
reliance
interests
as
to
preclude
the
pto
from
reassessing
what
it's
done,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
reliance
interests
aren't
important.
and
the
third
thing
i
would
say
is
even
when
a
defendant
in
an
infringement
suit
comes
forward
with
prior
art
that
was
not
itself
considered
by
the
pto,
there's
always
the
possibility
that
that
prior
art
will
be
substantively
equivalent
to
prior
art
that
the
pto
did
consider;
and
so
in
cases
like
this,
in
form
the
defendant
would
be
asking
the
jury
to
make
a
determination
that
the
pto
had
never
made,
but
in
substance,
what
the
defendant
would
be
asking
the
jury
to
do
is
conclude
that
what
the
pto
thought
was
a
patentable
advance
really
was
not
so.
