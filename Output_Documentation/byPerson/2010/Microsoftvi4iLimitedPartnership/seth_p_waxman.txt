mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
long-settled,
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
is
correct,
one,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
two,
as
a
matter
of
stare
decisis
in
a
field
in
which
stability
is
particularly
important,
and,
three,
as
a
matter
of
first
principles.
as
to
one,
in
1952
congress
codified
a
long,
uniform
line
of
decisions
from
this
court
holding
that
the
presumption
of
validity
imposes
a
heightened
burden
of
proof,
a
burden
of
proof
that
this
court
in
rca
unanimously
described
as,
quote,
"clear
and
cogent
evidence".
and
for
the
past
28
years
congress
has
actively
acquiesced
in
the
federal
circuit's
consistent
holding
expressly
drawn
from
rca
that
the
standard
is
"clear
and
convincing".
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
thought
that
might
get
a
rise
out
of
you.
[laughter]
i
hope
i'll
get
a
chance
to
go
to
first
principles,
but
having
made
that
provocative
statement,
the
point
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
may
want
to
submit
a
supplemental
brief
on
that
point.
[laughter]
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
this
is
not
a
statute
that
congress
enacted
and
then
forgot
about.
this
is
a
statute
in
which
beginning
in
1980,
even
before
the
federal
circuit
was
created,
congress
started
amending
the
law
to
address
the
problem
of
low-quality
patents,
with
the
first
re-examination
procedure
in
1980,
any
number
of
amendments,
including
to
section
282,
the
creation
of
interparties
re-examination
in
1999,
and
the
current
consideration
of
a
post-grant
review
process.
so
congress
has
been
very,
very
active
in
this
field,
and
what
i
mean
by
active
acquiescence
is
it
has
been
very
active
in
this
field,
it
is
well
aware
of
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard,
and
it
has
done
nothing
whatsoever
to
change
it,
even
make
any
effort
to
consider
making
such
a
sweeping
change
in
long-standing
doctrine.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
as
to
presumptions
generally,
i
found
particularly
persuasive
your
opinion
for
the
third
circuit
in
gi
holding.
but
more--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--more
directly
to
the
point,
and
with
all
due
deference
to
the
sensibilities
of
the
presiding
justice
for
this
argument,
when
congress
enacted
section
282
in
1952,
the
revisers
note
the
house
committee
report,
the
senate
committee
report
said
that
they
were,
quote,
"codifying
the
existing
presumption
of
patent
validity.
"
and
this
court
had
unanimously
said
--
and
this
is
language
from
rca
that
microsoft
does
not
address
--
on
page
2
of
its
opinion
says,
quote,
"even
for
the
purpose
of
a
controversy
of
--
with
strangers
there
is
a
presumption
of
validity,
a
presumption
not
to
be
overthrown
except
by
clear
and
cogent
evidence.
"
now,
to
be
sure,
that
was
dicta
in
the
sense
that
the
case
in
itself
involves
a
priority
issue.
but
it
was
the
holding
of
the
court
3
years
later
in
smith
v.
hall;
it
was
repeated
on
the
very
same
day
in
mumm,
and
it
was
--
the
court
spent
an
entire
page,
i
think
page
7,
the
better
part
of
page
7
and
8
of
its
opinion,
explaining
that
--
enunciating
a
general
principle
of
the
law,
and
it
would
be
a
cruel
joke
on
congress
to
have
said,
we
are,
when
it
said
we
are
codifying
the
existing
presumption,
that
that
presumption
was
not
exactly
what
the
supreme
--
the
supreme
court
unanimously
had
said,
which
is
a
presumption
not
to
be
overthrown
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
now,
that's
--
it's
not
that
the
first
sentence
uses
the
word
presumption.
it
uses
the
word
essentially
presumption
of
patent
validity,
which
is
a
feature,
a
uniform
feature
of
the
supreme
court's
jurisprudence
since
the
court
first
started
addressing
this
issue
in
1873,
and
indeed
when
justice
story
first
decided
the
washburn
v.
gould
case,
there
is
--
their
argument
is
the
standard
is
a
preponderance.
there
is
not
one
opinion,
there
is
not
one
sentence,
there
is
not
one
phrase
in
any
of
this
court's
line
of
decisions
that
supports
that
proposition
--
and
when
judge
rich
said
in
19
--
shortly
after
1952
that
there
was
some
disarray
in
the
courts'
opinions,
he
was
--
and
you
can
look
at
his
opinion
in
context.
he
was
talking
about
lower
court
decisions
that
had
either
ignored
or
misinterpreted
this
court's
very
clear
holdings
--
holdings
which,
by
the
way,
refute
not
only
their
argument
for
a
universal
standard,
preponderance
standard,
but
directly
refute
their
argument
that
there
somehow
is
some
other
standard
of
proof
that
applies
with
respect
to
evidence
that
assertedly
was
not
before
the
patent
office.
that
was
true
of
most
of
this
court's
cases
decided
before
rca,
and
for
that
matter
after
rca.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
and
the
federal
circuit
has
said
that
over
and
over
and
over
again.
i
mean,
i'm
going
to
quibble
with
the
word
"would"
because
i
think
the
actual
language
of
the
instruction
can't
invade
the
province
of
the
jury.
but
you
could
--
certainly
could
say
that
the
defendant
contends
that
the
patent
is
invalid
because
the
law
presumes
that
a
patent
issued
by
the
pto
is
valid,
the
defendant
bears
the
burden
of
proving
invalidity
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
in
deciding
whether
the
defendant
has
met
that
burden,
you
may
find
it
more
easily
met
with
evidence
that
you
conclude
the
patent
office
did
not
consider
in
evaluating
patentability.
that
is
the
long-standing
established
rule
of
the
federal
circuit.
it
was
stated,
as
was
recognized
in
american
hoist,
in
1984,
and
the
explanation
for
it,
judge
rich's
explanation
is
exactly
the
same
in
cite
that
this
court's
statement's
in
ksr
is,
which
is
that
there
--
there
are
--
there
are
reasons
independent
of
deference
to
a
particular
pto
decision
that
warrant
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard,
and
--
and
this
is
key
--
there
is
no
case
from
this
court,
to
my
knowledge,
in
anglo-american
jurisprudence,
that
creates
or
sanctions
a
regime
in
which
there
are
different
standards
of
proof
with
respect
to
a
particular
issue
that
a
jury
has
to
decide.
the
question
--
when
there
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
there
--
are
you
referring
to
cases
of
this
court?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
okay.
i'm
--
i'm
talking
here
about
--
the
argument
here
is
about
the
standard
of
proof,
that
is,
a
jury
has
to
be
instructed
is
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
is
it
preponderance,
is
it
clear
and
convincing?
i'm
not
aware
of
any
instance
in
anglo-american
jurisprudence,
and
certainly
microsoft
and
its
amici
have
not
cited
one
in
which
the
jury
is
told
that
depending
on
the
weight
you
ascribe
to
the
evidence
you
heard,
you
should
apply
a
different
standard
of
proof.
the
issue
goes
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
i
mean,
imagine
a
case
in
--
a
regime
in
which
you
said,
well,
you've
heard
eyewitness
testimony.
if
you,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
find
that
the
eyewitness
really
had
an
unimpeded
view,
the
standard
is
preponderance,
but
if
you
think
that
the
view
was
impeded
or
obscured,
the
standard
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
the
--
the
assertion
that
there
was
evidence
that
the
jury
--
that
the
pto
didn't
hear,
and
as
the
briefs
point
out
it
is
far
from
black
and
white
what
the
pto
does
or
doesn't
consider.
and
in
addition
the
--
it's
far
from
clear
whether
the
unconsidered
evidence
is,
quote,
more
pertinent
than
evidence
that
was
considered.
even
assuming
that,
the
jury
is
told,
for
reasons
of
first
principles,
that
i
will
articulate
in
a
moment
if
left
to
my
own
devices,
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
but
you
may
find
that
burden
more
easily
met
if
you
find
that
there
was,
in
fact,
evidence
relating
to
validity
that
was
not,
in
fact,
considered
by
the
pto
when
it
issued
this
property
right.
now,
the
first--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
mean,
a
lot--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
--
there
are
--
there
are
any
number
of
formulations
that
trial
courts
have
given.
i
think
the
one
that
would
be
clearest
would
be
one
that
says
in
deciding
whether
the
defendant
has
met
his
burden,
you
may
give
added
weight
to
evidence
that
you
find
the
pto
didn't
consider
in
deciding
validity.
the
case
i
think
you're
referring
to
was
microsoft's
earlier
case
involving
z4,
where
unlike
this
case,
microsoft
did
ask
for
an
instruction
but
it
was
rejected
by
the
court
--
it
was
--
it
was
rejected
by
the
court
and
found
not
to
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
the
key
point
with
respect
to
that
instruction
goes
to
the
articulation
that
was
suggested
earlier,
because
in
that
case
the
instruction
said
you
--
you
make
--
i
instruct
--
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me,
but
it
was
essentially
a
mandatory
instruction
to
give
greater
weight
or
that
the
burden
would
be
more
easily
met.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
is
a
--
there
is
a
great
difference,
justice
scalia,
between
telling
individual
jurors
what
amount
of
weight
they
may
or
may
not
give
to
certain
evidence
in
creating
a
dual
standard
of
proof
which
would,
for
reasons
that
--
that
microsoft's
own
amici
point
out,
requires
--
would
require
the
jury
first
to
determine
whether
this
evidence
was
or
wasn't
considered
and
was
or
wasn't
more
pertinent--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
as
--
as
i
think
all
the
parties
agree,
and
we
reflect
the
--
we
reflect
the
--
the
research,
i
believe,
on
footnote
12
of
our
brief,
the
--
this
point
is
argued
in
many,
many,
many
cases.
that
is
--
and
it
was
true
in
this
case.
evidence
is
put
on
that
the
jury
--
that
the
pto
didn't
consider
this
particular
prior
art,
although,
you
know,
in
this
case
the
file
wrapper
shows
that
there
were
five
prior
art
rejections
based
on
other
art
before
the
patent
was
allowed,
and
counsel
argue
it
to
and
fro
to
the
jury,
as
the
allison
and
lemley
article
points
out,
the
statistics
bear
out
the
common
sense,
which
is
that
juries
are,
in
fact,
very
influenced
by
the
fact
that
there
was
art
going
to
or
questioning
validity
that
was
not
considered
by
the
pto.
in
other
words,
the
instruction,
whether
the
instruction
is
necessary
or
not,
juries
get
it,
and
juries
apply
it.
what
they're
not
required
to
do
is
apply
two
different
standards
of
proof
following
all
sorts
of
predicate
determinations
that
they
would
have
to
make.
may
i
simply
list
the
first
--
the
first--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
--
here
are
four
independent
principles
that
justify
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
across
the
board
regardless
of
what
the
jury
considered.
number
one,
an
infringer's
validity
challenge
is
a
collateral
attack
on
a
government
decision
that
has
already
been
made,
quite
unlike
grogan
and
huddleston,
that
bestows
property
rights
by
written
instrument.
number
two,
the
harm
from
an
erroneous
determination
is
hugely
asymmetrical.
a
single
holding
of
invalidity
by
a
single
lay
jury
vitiates
for
all
time
the
patent
and
all
of
the
reliance
interest
by
the
inventor
and
the
investors
and
the
licensees
who
have
relied
upon
that
ex
ante.
third,
this
grant
of
property
rights
not
only
induces
reliance,
which
lack,
like
the
land
patent
cases
induce
reliance,
this
is
a
grant
of
a
property
right
that
under
the
constitution
is
specifically
designed
to
induce
reliance
in
exchange
for
the
inventor's
honoring
her
half
of
the
patent
bargain,
that
is
public
disclosure
of
her
intellectual
property
for
the
public
benefit,
and
the
commitment
of
capital
by
investors
and
licensees
that's
necessary
to
bring
into
fruition
for
the
public
benefit.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
and
the
fact
--
yes,
the
re-examine
system
--
i
think
your
point
actually,
i
wish
i
had
thought
to
make
this
point
myself.
re-examine
is
often
invoked
by
the
patent
holder.
that
is,
because
re-exam
is
done
by
the
expert
agency
and
allows
the
patent
--
allows
the
agency
not
to
have
a
binary
choice
of
yes,
the
patent's
fine
or
no,
it's
invalid
for
all
time,
but
can
narrow
the
scope
of
the
patent
in
re-exam,
many
re-exams
are
requested
by
the
patent
holder.
and
more
--
and
also,
when
you
request
re-examination
or
when
the
pto
makes
a
re-exam
decision,
that
decision
is
good
for
all
time,
whichever
way
it
goes,
unlike
the
stark
asymmetry
in
trial
court
litigation
where
the
patent
holder
has
to
win
100
percent
of
the
time.
if
the
patent
holder
loses
once,
the
patent
under
nonmutual
offensive
collateral
estoppel,
blonder-tongue,
the
patent
is
out.
and
i
should
point
out
that
this
court's
opinion
in
blonder-tongue,
which
of
course
was
a
case
about
patent
validity--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
those
are
policy
arguments
that
have--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--excuse
me?
no,
the
fact
that
--
the
fact
that
it's
a
collateral
challenge
on
a
government
decision
bestowing
property
rights
by
written
instrument,
no.
the
fact
that
the
harm
from
an
erroneous
decision
is
totally
asymmetrical,
no.
the
fact
that
what
congress
intended
was
that
this
grant
of
property
rights
actually
induced
reliance,
and
finally
--
and
this
is
my
final
first
principle,
i
suppose
--
that
changing
this
long-standing
standard
would
marginalize
the
pto,
the
expert
agency
that
we
know
congress
created
to
superintend
the
issuance
and
re-examination
of
patents,
and
to
the
extent
that
there
are
significant
policy
concerns
which
i
agree
with
--
may
i
finish
my
sentence?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--which
i
agree
with:
a,
congress
is
on
the
job;
and,
b,
there
is
--
those
policy
reasons
say
nothing
about
what
congress
thought
about
the
patent
office
in
1952
when
it
applied
this
court's
unanimous
presumption.
thank
you.
