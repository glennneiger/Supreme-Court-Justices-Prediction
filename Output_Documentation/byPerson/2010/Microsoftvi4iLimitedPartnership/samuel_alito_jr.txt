if
the
challenger
has
the
burden
of
persuasion,
wouldn't
it
almost
go
without
saying
that
the
challenger
would
also
have
the
burden
of
production
on
the
issue
of
invalidity?
so
what
would
be
added
then
by
--
what
role
is
played
then
by
that
sentence,
a
patent
shall
be
presumed
valid?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
i
could
take
you
back
to
first
principles,
which
is
where
you
started,
i
have
three
problems
in
seeing
your
interpretation
in
the
language
of
section
282.
first,
the
statute
says
the
burden
of
establishing
invalidity
of
a
patent,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
shall
rest
on
the
parties
asserting
such
invalidity.
if
congress
wanted
to
impose
a
clear
and
convincing
burden,
why
in
the
world
would
they
not
have
said
that
expressly
in
that
sentence?
number
two,
if
the
first
sentence,
"a
patent
shall
be
presumed
valid.
"
means
that
--
is
talking
about
the
burden,
then
it's
superfluous,
because
that's
dealt
with
in
the
second
sentence.
and,
third,
the
phrase
"shall
be
presumed
valid"
doesn't
seem
to
me
at
all
to
suggest
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
a
presumption
normally
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
most
presumptions
can
be
disproved
by
much
less
than
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
so
how
do
you
read
that
in
--
your
--
your
position
into
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i've
gotten
a
lot
smarter
since
then.
[laughter]
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that
ground
doesn't
carry
very
much
weight
when
the
matter
was
never
considered
by
the
pto.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
--
why
is
re-examination
sufficient
to
answer
the
concerns
that
justice
breyer
mentioned,
when
re-examination
can't
consider
certain
issues,
and
a
case
such
as
this
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
stayed
while
re-examination
takes
place?
