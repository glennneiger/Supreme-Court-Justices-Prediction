justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
one
question
here
i
would
like
to
get
your
view
on.
i'll
assume
that
the
language
is
open
enough
in
the
history
so
that
we
could
make
what
would
be
a
change,
i
think
it
would
be
a
change.
the
reasons
as
i
get
from
the
brief
for
doing
that
are
because
there
are
two
types
of
errors:
it's
a
bad
thing
not
to
give
protection
to
an
invention
that
deserves
it;
and
it
is
just
as
bad
a
thing
to
give
protection
to
an
invention
that
doesn't
deserve
it.
both
can
seriously
harm
the
economy.
and
you
are
also
saying
that
the
patent
office
is
out
of
control,
not
through
its
own
fault,
but
there
are
too
few
people
and
too
many
inventions.
and
therefore
type
two
error
is
a
real
risk.
so
i'm
turning
you
to
and
say:
well,
what
should
we
do
about
it?
i
know
your
proposal.
but
we
have
also
seen
in
these
briefs
the
following
proposal:
one,
somebody
who
thinks
there
is
a
type
two
error,
go
back
to
the
patent
office
and
ask
for
reconsideration.
that's
pretty
good.
we
get
the
experts
to
look
at
it
again.
and
then
that's
coupled
with:
tell
the
district
judges
to
stick
very
closely
to
their
job,
allow
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
to
apply
to
facts,
and
by
that
we
mean
brute
facts,
and
let
them
decide
the
brute
facts,
but
let
the
judge
decide
whether
that
amounts
to
obviousness,
novelty,
or
any
of
the
other
prerequisites.
now,
i've
gotten
that
out
of
the
amicus
briefs,
some
of
which
say
they
support
you
but
they
really
don't.
so
i
would
like
--
i
would
like
your
views
on
those
two
suggestions
as
being
sufficient
to
cure
the
problem
that
you
point
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
getting
that
out
of
the
american
intellectual
property
law
association.
i
don't
blame
them
for
my
phrasing
of
it,
but
that
is
what
struck
the
thought
in
my
mind
that
careful
instructions
limiting
the
juries
to
brute
facts
and
giving
the
judge
the
notion,
the
job
of
characterizing
that
--
you
heard
what
i
said
--
that
that
will
go
a
long
way
towards
curing
the
problem
you're
worried
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
might
not
in
your
situation.
but
the
problem
is
in
principle
as
it's
put
to
us
that
the
office
and
the
federal
circuit
emerge
giving
protection
to
things
that
aren't
really
novel,
that
aren't
really
advances
on
the
prior
art,
et
cetera.
now,
if
that's
the
problem,
and
you
carefully
instruct
the
jury,
the
bad
fake
patents
will
go
away
because
the
judge
will
say:
look,
this
metal
case
called
a
battery
leakproof
is
not
really
novel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
the
judge
says:
i
want
you
to
find
if
this
metal
container
is
leak
proof.
jury:
yes.
now
it's
up
to
the
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
those
first
principles
are
along
the
lines
of
how
important
patents
are
and
what
a
disaster
is
it
is
to
the
person
once
they're
invalidated.
okay.
i
think
the
other
side
will
say:
in
today's
world,
where
nobody
really
understands
this
technology
very
well,
a
worse
disaster
for
the
country
is
to
have
protection
given
to
things
that
don't
deserve
it
because
they
act
as
a
block
on
trade,
they
act
as
monopolies,
and
they
will
tie
the
country
up
in
individual
monopolies
that
will
raise
prices
to
consumers,
et
cetera.
you
can
imagine
my
spelling
out
this
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
can't
work
out
in
my
own
mind
whether
in
today's
world
these
first
principles
cut
for
the
patentee
or
cut
for
the
challenger
to
the
patent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
first
are
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
rule
where
--
i'm
trying
this
on,
i
don't
buy
it
necessarily
--
the
--
the
heightened
standard
exists
where
the
patent
office
did
consider
it
or
could
have
considered
it
had
the
infringer
asked
for
reconsideration?
in
other
words,
put
the
burden
on
the
infringing
party
to
use
this
procedure,
and
if
he
does
use
it,
it's
going
to
get
a
heightened
burden
if
he
loses--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
if
he
doesn't
use
it,
it
should
get
a
heightened
burden
because
he
should
have
used
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
statute
itself
doesn't
--
we're
all
going
on
history
here,
i
mean,
and
history
brought
up
to
date
with
the
words
of
the
statute
i
don't
think
cover
it
either
way.
they
talk
about
presumption,
but
put
that
to
the
side.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wanted
your
opinion
on
that
as
the
validity
or
a
useful
instruction
for
juries.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
asking
that
question.
i'm
asking
the
question
of
whether
in
your
experience
as
a
patent
lawyer
or
--
would
--
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
we're
trying
to
get
a
better
tool,
if
possible,
to
separate
the
sheep
from
the
goats.
that's
what
we're
after,
i
think,
and
so
what
is
that
better
tool?
