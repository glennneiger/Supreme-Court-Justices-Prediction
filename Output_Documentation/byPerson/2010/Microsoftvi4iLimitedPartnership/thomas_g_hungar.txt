mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
justice
scalia,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
circuit's
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
ensures
the
enforcement
of
invalid
patents,
even
though
this
court
recognized
in
ksr
that
invalid
patents
stifle
rather
than
promote
the
progress
of
liberal
arts.
under
this
court's
decisions
in
grogan
and
huddleston,
the
default
preponderance
standard
should
govern
in
all
cases
because
section
282
does
not
specify
a
heightened
standard
of
proof.
and
as
this
court
suggested
in
ksr,
it
makes
no
sense
to
have
a
heightened
standard
of
proof
when
the
relevant
prior
art
evidence
was
never
even
considered
by
pto.
under
any
view,
it
was
error
to
require
clear
and
convincing
proof
of
invalidity
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
justice
cardozo
was
not
addressing
a
case
in
which
the
evidence
at
issue
had
not
been
considered
by
the
patent
office.
to
the
contrary,
the
court
made
clear--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
our
position
and
our
view
of
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that
grogan
and
huddleston
approach.
the
statute
does
not
specify
a
heightened
standard;
therefore,
preponderance,
the
default
standard;
applies.
i
was
attempting
to
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
the
rca
case.
and
the
rca
case
didn't
address
the
question
that
was
discussed
in
ksr,
but
we
believe,
as
i
said,
that
the
--
that
the
preponderance
standard
should
govern
across
the
board.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
to
the
extent
that
--
that
justice
cardozo
was
discussing
a
heightened
standard
in
the
limited
context
of
priority
inventions,
we
think
that
that's
not
consistent
with
section
282,
which,
of
course,
came
later.
moreover,
i
would
note
that
the
concerns
that
undergirded
the
court's
heightened
standard
in
priority
of
invention
cases,
where
--
those
concerns
were
addressed
to
the
--
the
problem
of
primarily
oral
testimony
being
offered
to
substantiate
priority
of
invention
claims.
the
federal
circuit
has
separately
addressed
that
issue
by
means
of
its
corroboration
requirement,
which
operates
separate
and
independent
of
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard,
so
the
concerns
that
undergirded
rca
are
--
are
completely
taken
care
of
by
that
as
well.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
actually,
your
honor,
i
agree
that
there
is
some
grand
language
used
in
dictum
in
that
case.
certainly,
the
holding
doesn't
extend
beyond
the
--
what
was
presented
before
the
court.
but,
actually,
if
you
read
the
language
carefully,
you'll
see
again
and
again
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
it's
a
question
of
--
of
prior
invention.
he
says
when
the
defense
is
a
prior
invention,
and
then
he
quotes
the
heightened
standard
on
page
7.
again,
on
page
8,
he
talks
about
the
defense
of
invention
by
another.
so
he
--
and
every
single
one
of
the
cases
that
he
cites
there,
without
exception
in
that
discussion
on
pages
7
to
8,
is
a
priority
of
invention
case,
the
barbed
wire
patent
case
being
the
leading
example
which
had
explained
this
rationale
for
a
heightened
concern
in
that
specific
context.
but
you
don't
have
cases
applying
--
supreme
court
cases
applying
the
heightened
standard
in
other
contexts.
and,
indeed,
you
have
many
cases
decided
after
rca
that
don't
mention
any
heightened
standard
in
viewing
invalidity
questions.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
and
read
--
taken
out
of
context,
that
could
have
broad
implications,
but
the
sentences
before
and
after
clearly
make
--
indicate
that
he's
talking
about
priority
of
invention.
he
talks
about
the
title
of
the
true
inventor
and
so
forth.
so
--
so,
again,
that's
what
those
cases
said,
and
that's
what
a
fair
reading
of
rca
says.
but,
regardless
of
the
best
reading
of
rca,
we
--
the
--
the
question
here
is
what
did
congress
do
in
1952?
and
we
know
that
congress
in
1952
could
not
possibly
have
understood
the
law
to
be
an
across-the-board
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
certainly
--
yes,
your
honor,
certainly
we
think
american
hoist
is
wrong,
although
i
would
note
that
judge
rich,
in
his
american
hoist
decision,
says
that
the
cases
prior
to
1952
were
all
over
the
map.
but
--
but
the
relevant
question
is
what
would
congress
have
thought
the
state
of
the
law
was
in
1952.
if
you
think
that
there's
any
merit
at
all
to
the
judicial
codification
argument,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
could
not
have
thought
in
1952
that
the
law
was
an
across-the-board
heightened
standard,
because
case
after
case
after
case
rejected
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
heightened
standard
or
that
the
presumption
was
unaffected
when
the
evidence
was
not
considered
by
the
patent
office.
the
--
we've
cited
numerous
cases
in
our
brief
at
pages
34
through
36.
the
--
and
we
also
in
the
reply
brief
at
footnote
3
reference
a
list
of
over
200
cases,
some
from
before
1952
and
some
from
after
1952,
all
recognizing
that
the
presumption
of
validity
was
weakened
or
eliminated
when
the
prior
art
evidence
was
not
considered
by
the
patent
office.
so,
you
just--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
first
of
all,
again,
because
rca
in
context
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
priority
of
invention
dispute
that
had
been
adjudicated
in
the
patent
office
on
the
same
evidence
previously
resolved
by
the
court,
a
priority
of
invention
dispute,
where
the
heightened
standard
cases
had
some
application,
it
clearly
wouldn't
affect
the
standards
in
this
case.
but,
more
fundamentally,
that's
not
what
congress
thought
in
1952,
and
when
you
don't
have
a
clear
rule
to
be
codified,
the
default
rules
of
statutory
construction
apply.
the
default
rule
of
statutory
construction
in
a
--
on
this
question,
in
grogan
and
huddleston,
the
preponderance
standard
applies.
and,
moreover,
while
the
statute
does
not
specify
a
heightened
standard,
it
does
actually
speak
to
and
--
and
preclude
the
argument
that
i4i
makes,
because
the
first
sentence
refers
to
patents
being
presumed
valid
under
this
court's
precedent,
a
presumption
shifts
the
burden
of
going
forward,
and
the
second
sentence
of
the
original
statute
refers
to
the
burden
of
proof.
under
their
interpretation,
presumption
does
all
the
work.
the
first
sentence
not
only
shifts
the
burden
of
going
forward,
also
shifts
the
burden
of
proof,
and
does
so
under
a
heightened
standard,
which
has
never
been
how
presumption
is
interpreted
generally
in
the
law,
and
it
renders
the
second
sentence
entirely
superfluous.
there's
no
need
for
it.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor,
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
but
i
would
note
that
this
is,
i
think,
i4i's
congressional
acquiescence
argument,
if
you
will,
and
that
argument
fails
for
numerous
reasons.
first
of
all,
if
there
could
be
any
acquiescence,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
--
this
court's
extremely
high
requirements
for
such
a
claim
have
been
satisfied
here,
but
if
there
could
be
any
acquiescence
at
all,
the
first
30
years
after
enactment
of
the
statute
would
be
the
most
relevant
consideration
in
determining
what
congress
had
acquiesced
in,
and
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
regional
circuits
all
rejected
the
across-the-board
heightened
standard
that
i4i
is
arguing
for.
so
if
congress
acquiesced
in
anything,
it
was
not
an
across-the-board
heightened
standard.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
if
i
understand
the
--
the
question
correctly,
first
of
all,
i
would
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
the
cases,
but
with
respect
to
the
preservation
issue,
we
objected
to
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
instruction,
and
we
also
said
that
if
--
if
any
instruction
on
the
heightened
standard
is
going
to
be
given,
it
needs
to
reflect
that
--
the
fact
that,
at
least
with
respect
to
prior
art
combinations
that
were
not
considered
by
the
patent
office,
the
standard
should
be
a
preponderance.
and,
indeed,
that's
true
of
all
of
the
prior
art
combinations
that
were
at
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
we
didn't
ask--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--but,
your
honor,
we
did
object
to
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
instruction,
and
so
if
--
we
don't
think
that's
the
right
answer,
the
more
easily
satisfied
instruction,
if
that's
what
your
honor
is
referring
to.
but
if
that
were
the
court's
conclusion,
that
that
is
in
fact
what
the
law
requires,
then
our
objection
to
the
clear
and
--
the
unmodified
clear
and
convincing
evidence
instruction
would
justify
a
new
trial
here.
but
more
fundamentally,
even
the
federal
circuit--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--because
that
in
effect--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
that
construction
would
not
solve
the
fundamental
problem,
which
is
that
when
the
patent
office
didn't
even
consider
the
evidence,
it
makes
absolutely
no
sense,
as
the
krsr
court
indicated,
to
have
this
heightened
deference.
the
statute
requires
a
degree
of
deference
by
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
burden
of
going
forward,
but
for
i4i
to
say
that
we
need
to
go
beyond
what
the
presumption
is,
the
normal
default
standard
of
preponderance,
you
need
some
heightened
reason
for
that.
there's
absolutely
none,
particularly
when
the
patent
office
didn't
consider
the
evidence,
didn't
make
a
decision,
there
was
no
decision
and
no
evidence
considered
going
to
the
relevant
question.
that's
not--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
re-exam,
re-exam
is
not
a
solution
to
the
problem
or
an
answer
to
the
absence
of
justification
for
a
heightened
standard,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
re-exam
is
limited
in
scope.
it
can
only
consider
certain
types
of
prior
art
evidence
and
issues.
it
couldn't,
for
example
--
it
was
not
available
for
the
issue
that
we're
talking
about
here,
the
on-sale
bar.
there
are
various
issues,
the
section
112
issues,
such
as
written
description
and
best
mode
and
the
like,
are
not
susceptible
of
re-examination.
statutory
subject
matter
is
not
susceptible
of
re-examination.
many
kinds
of
prior
art,
anything
other
than
actual
patents
or
publications,
cannot
be
referenced
in
the
examination.
so
it
is
a
limited
mode
of
inquiry
that
does
not
address
many
types
of
prior
art
that
come
up
in
many
types
of
important
cases,
technology
cases
in
particular.
so
that's
one
reason
why
the
re-exam
solution
is
not
a
problem,
and
of
course
it
can't
possibly
be
used
to
infer
some
intent
on
the
part
of
congress.
i4i
and
the
government
try
to
suggest
that
this
was
part
of
the
scheme
of
congress
and
this
is
why
clear
and
convincing
makes
sense.
but
re-exam
was
enacted
in
1980,
long
after
the
'52
act,
so
it
doesn't
shed
light
on
congress's
intent
in
enacting
section
282.
and
it
was
enacted
before
the
federal
circuit
had
created
its
heightened
standard,
so
it
can't
possibly
have
been
an
attempt
to
address
the
problems
created
by
an
across-the-board
heightened
standard
that
did
not
exist
at
the
time.
in
1980
the
law
was
clear
that
a
preponderance
standard
governed
in
most
or
all
cases
and
a
preponderance
standard,
of
course,
governs
in
re-exam
as
well.
so
re-exam
is
not
a
solution.
the
more
easily
satisfied
instruction
or
that
type
of
approach.
if
that's
what
i
understand--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
addresses
the
problem
because
the
fundamental
problem
is
imposing
this
heightened
standard
on
the
jury
that
has
no
moorings
in
the
statute
and
no
moorings
in
common
sense,
particularly
in
a
case
like
this
one
where
the
relevant
evidence
was
not
only
not
considered
by
the
patent
office
but
withheld
from
the
patent
office.
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--but,
your
honor,
if
that
were
--
the
judge
can't
give
an
instruction
like
that.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
i
think
in
many
of
these
cases
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
or
impossible
for
judge
to
fashion
at
that
level
of
specificity
the
factual
issues
to
be
considered
by
the
jury.
but
more
fundamentally,
if
you're
getting
into
that
level
of
detail
and
addressing
questions
that
the
patent
office
didn't
even
consider
or
certainly
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
with
the
full
array
of
procedural
advantages
that
litigation
and
discovery
offer,
it
just
makes
no
sense
to
impose
a
heightened
standard.
as
one
of
your
honor's
earlier
questions
pointed
out,
the
fundamental
problem
here
is
that
the
interests
on
the
i4i
side
of
the
equation,
the
policy
interests,
are
outweighed
if
anything
by
this
court's
repeated
recognition
that
invalid
patents
stifle
innovation
and
competition
and
are
very
harmful.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
the
law
actually
before
1952
was
quite
unsettled
on
that
question,
as
we
noted
in
our
brief
and
as
judge
rich,
i
believe,
noted
in
the
american
hoist
case,
there
were
actually
cases
prior
to
1952
saying
that
the
burden
was
on
the
patent
holder
to
establish
a
validity.
so
what
congress--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
believe
--
you
know,
the
cases
aren't
crystal-clear
on
that.
i
think
certainly
they
were
talking
about
the
burden
of
persuasion
and
presumably
also
the
burden
of
going
forward.
but
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
recall
that
they
speak
to
that
level
of
specificity.
but
certainly
there
are
cases
saying
the
burden
is
on
the
patent
holder.
congress
overturned
those
cases
by
imposing
--
by
stating
in
the
second
sentence
that
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
on
the
defendant.
but
it
only
makes
sense,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
for
congress
to
have
added
that
sentence
if
it
didn't
view
the
presumption
sentence
as
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
defendant,
let
alone
shifting
it
under
a
heightened
standard,
so--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
think
that's
unclear,
your
honor.
certainly
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
party
with
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof
does
not
bear
--
does
not
have
the
burden
of
persuasion
at
every
stage.
and
congress
--
there
were
also
cases
prior
to
1952
suggesting
that
the
presumption
had
gone
away,
that
there
was
no
longer
a
presumption
of
validity
or
that
the
presumption
went
the
other
way.
and
so
again,
congress
wanted
to
be
clear;
it
was
saying
there
is
a
presumption
which
shifts
the
burden
of
going
forward
under
this
court's
precedence,
and
there
is
a
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant,
and
that's
all
it
did.
to
infer
that
it
did
something
much
more,
much
more
than
the
pre-1952
cases
authorized
--
there
are
literally
dozens
of
pre-1952
cases
cited
in
that
list
of
200
cases
referenced
at
footnote
3
of
our
brief,
from
prior
to
1952,
rejecting
the
notion
that
there's
an
across-the-board
heightened
presumption
of
validity;
saying,
no,
if
the
evidence
was
not
considered
by
the
patent
office
or
in
some
--
the
western
auto
case,
for
example,
from
the
sixth
circuit
says
well,
there's
this
--
the
exception
for
oral
testimony
of
prior
invention,
that's
the
rca
case;
but
everything
else
is
preponderance.
so
there's
no
--
there's
no
heightened
presumption
of
validity
in
any
other
circumstances.
so
i
think
the
law
was
clear,
and
the
treatises
we
cite
at
page
9
of
our
reply
brief
also
make
clear
the
treatise
writers
understood,
there
was
no
across-the-board
heightened
presumption
that
it
was
weakened
or
eliminated
when
the
evidence
was
not
before
the
patent
office.
and
some
of
the
cases
said
--
actually
rca
itself
cites
with
approval
two
court
of
appeals
cases
that
we
note
in
our
reply
brief,
the
studie
case
and
the
wilson
case,
which
rejected
the
notion
of
a
heightened
standard
across
the
board.
they
said
well,
that's
true
when
the
issue
was
adjudicated
before
the
patent
office,
but
here
where
the
patent
office
did
not
adjudicate
the
issue
that
doesn't
apply.
so
again
you
just
can't
get
out
of
the
pre-1952
case
law
--
the
rule
that
i4i
is
urging.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
a
few
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
that
the
jury
should
be
instructed
on
the
weight
to
be
given
various
forms
of
evidence,
i
note
that
in
the
z4
case
that's
been
discussed,
the
federal
circuit
rejected
the
very,
quote,
i4i
suggests
as
the
solution,
and
it
did
so
because
it
would
confuse
the
jury
about
what
the
standard
is.
having
effectively
three
standards
of
proof
in
patent
cases
rather
than
two
is
hardly
a
solution
to
the
problem;
but
more
fundamentally,
whatever
instructions
might
or
might
not
be
appropriate
regarding
the
particular
evidence
before
the
jury,
there
has
to
be
a
justification
for
departing
from
this
default
preponderance
standard,
and
no
sufficient
justification
has
been
offered.
the
statute
doesn't
provide
for
it,
the
legislative
history
doesn't
reference
it,
the
pre-1952
case
law
can't
reasonably
be
read
in
that
way.
that
the
--
i4i
and
its
amici
do
not
point
to
a
single
case
in
the
--
in
the
years
leading
up
to
1952,
the
15
or
so
years
prior
where
a
court
of
appeals
or
any
court
or
any
commentator
said
that
the
rule
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence
across
the
board.
no
one
understood
that
to
be
the
rule.
no
one
read
rca
that
way.
congress
would
not
have
done
so,
either,
so
you
can't
get
there
under
codification.
you
certainly
can't
get
there
under
principles
of
administrative
deference.
even
the
government
admits
those
that
principles
don't
justify
a
heightened
standard.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
first--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
don't
see
that
any
way
you
can
get
that
out
of
the
statute.
but
it
also
wouldn't
work,
because
re-exams--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
there--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
congress
certainly
couldn't
have
intended
that
in
1952
because
it
hadn't
yet
created
re-examination.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
as
you
know,
re-exam
is
not
available
for
many
of
the
types
of
invalidity
issues
that
arise.
but
in
any
event,
if
--
if
--
if
the
court
had
such
a
rule,
the
problem
is,
re-exam
takes
a
long
time,
patents
plaintiffs
generally
oppose
stays
of
litigation
for
re-examination,
because
they
want
to
get
to
the
jury
because
they
know
that
juries
are
much
more
likely
to
uphold
patents
than
either
judges
or
the
patent
office
on
re-exam.
so
they
want
to
get
the
case
litigated
as
quickly
as
possible
so
you
get
through
the
court
system
before
the
re-exam
has
been
completed.
so
to
the
--
in
fact
if
it
were
true,
as
some
of
the
amici
argue,
that
a
patent
applicant
--
patent
holders
are
afraid
of
juries
and
want
the
experts
at
pto
to
resolve
the
questions,
which
we
don't
think
as
a
--
as
a
factual
matter
is
accurate,
but
if
that
were
true,
the
patent
applicant,
the
patent
holder
has
the
absolute
right
to
initiate
re-exam
themselves,
and
they
could
certainly
go
to
the
court
and
say
please
stay
proceedings
pending
re-examination.
normally
when
--
courts
refuse
to
stay
proceedings,
because
they
don't
want
to
prejudice
the
plaintiff,
who
is
opposing
a
stay,
but
if
the
plaintiff
is
asking
for
a
stay,
there's
not
going
to
be
any
problem.
so
the
system
already
permits
patent
holders
to
--
to
--
to
follow
that
procedure
and
get
re-examination
if
they
want
it.
the
problem
is
they
usually
don't.
and
in
fact
a
preponderance
standard
would
encourage
that.
with
respect
to
the
reliance
arguments,
the
re-examination
problem
we
think
addresses
that.
the
fact
that
this
is
a
procedural
rule
under
this
court's
precedence
makes
clear
that
reliance
interests
are
lessened.
in
any
event,
the
reliance
interests
aren't
nearly
as
strong
as
the
same
arguments
made
by
many
of
the
same
parties
in
ksr,
and
medimmune
and
ebay
where
this
court
was
not
persuaded.
it
should
not
be
persuaded
here,
either.
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
that
they
rely
on,
if
you're
going
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
what
it
actually
says
is
that
congress
is
referring
to
the
presumption
as
stated
by
the
courts,
plural
--
not
the
supreme
court,
courts
plural
--
so
if
you're
going
to
look
at
legislative
history
it
actually
makes
clear
that
congress
was
not
looking
only
at
the
rca
case
which
is
not
even
referenced
in
the
legislative
history,
but
was
looking
at
rule
as
it
was
understood
to
exist
in
1952,
which
is
not
the
rule
that
i4i
urges.
with
respect
to
the
--
the
presumption
point,
the
presumption
clearly
does
serve
a
purpose,
the
presumption
language
in
the
statute,
by
overturning
the
courts
--
the
prior
to
1952
decisions
that
had
rejected
the
presumption,
and
by
making
clear
that
the
burden
of
going
forward
is
on
the
defendant,
so
the
plaintiff
doesn't
have
the
burden
that
it
would
otherwise
have
of
pleading
and
putting
forward
evidence
at
trial
of
validity.
for
all
these
reasons,
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
