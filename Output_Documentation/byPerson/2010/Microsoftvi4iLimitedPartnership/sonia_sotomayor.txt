justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
--
i
--
having
read
some
of
those
cases
that
you've
cited
that
you
claim
weakened
or
eliminated
the
burden
of
proof
standard,
most
of
them
didn't
quite
eliminate
it.
virtually
all
of
them
added
an
instruction
to
the
jury
of
some
sort
that
said
that
the
application
of
the
standard
should
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
pto
did
not
consider
evidence
--
did
not
consider
the
prior
art
relied
upon
in
the
invalidity
challenge.
you
didn't
ask
for
such
an
instruction
in
this
case;
is
that
correct?
and
if
you
didn't,
why
isn't
that
adequate
to
convey
the
point
that
you're
trying
to
convey,
that
a
jury
should,
in
fact,
consider
that
the
pto
never
got
to
see
that
prior
art?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
other
judges
give
a
slightly
different
standard.
they
give
a
clear
and
convincing
standard,
and
they
add
a
separate
instruction
that
tells
the
jury,
in
applying
that
standard,
you
should
consider
the
fact
that
the
pto
did
not
see
this
evidence.
you
didn't
ask
for
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
just
asked
for
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
charge?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
you
said
to
the
judge
below:
all
you
have
to
charge
is
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
you
never
told
him:
please
explain
to
the
jury
that
under
clear
and
convincing
they
can
take
into
account--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
there
a
lower
court
that
has
ruled
that
that
standard,
in
the
manner
that
you've
articulated,
could
confuse
a
jury
as
to
what
clear
and
convincing
evidence
means?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
fact,
it's
not
clear
and
convincing
evidence
if
you
phrase
it
that
way,
that
it's
something
less
than
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so,
the
amici
here
have
suggested
alternatives
to
that
language
that
you're
endorsing--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
the
problem
with
your
argument,
assuming
its
validity,
is
why
do
you
need
the
second
sentence?
if
congress
was
intending
to
sweep
up
in
the
use
of
the
word
"presumption"
the
need
to
overturn
it
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
why
did
you
need
the
second
sentence
saying
that
the
other
side
now
bore
the
burden
of
persuasion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
second
case
is
a
patent
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
i4i,
respondents
in
this
court
hold
that
the
patented
issue
which
claims
an
improved
method
for
editing
computer
documents.
i4i,
sued
petitioner
microsoft,
claiming
that
certain
microsurf
--
microsoft
word
products
infringe
on
behalf.
microsoft
counterclaim,
seeking
a
declaration
that
i4i's
patent
was
invalid
under
section
102(b)'s
on-sale
bar
which
precludes
patent
protection
for
any
invention
that
was
on
sale
in
this
country
more
than
one
year
prior
to
the
patent
applications.
the
parties
agreed
that
i4i
had
sold
the
software
program
known
as
s4
more
than
one
year
prior
to
its
patent
application.
they
disagreed
as
to
whether
s4
embodied
the
invention
claimed
in
i4i's
patent.
because
the
s4
software
was
not
considered
by
the
u.s.
patent
and
trademark
office,
the
pto,
microsoft
requested
a
jury
instruction
that
it
was
required
to
prove
its
in
--
invalidity
defense
only
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
district
court,
however,
instructed
the
jury
that
microsoft
was
obligated
to
prove
the
defense
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
the
jury
found
that
microsoft
willfully
infringed
i4i's
patent
and
that
microsoft
failed
to
prove
invalidity.
the
federal
circuit
affirmed,
relying
on
its
settled
precedent
that
section
282
of
the
patent
act
of
1952
requires
invalidity
to
be
proved
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
this
interpretation
of
section
282
is
correct.
section
282
provides
that
"a
patent
shall
be
presumed
valid"
and
"the
burden
of
establishing
invalidity
of
the
patent
shall
rest
on
the
party
asserting
such
invalidity."
thus,
by
its
expressed
term,
section
282
establishes
a
presumption
of
patent
validity
and
it
provides
that
a
challenger
must
overcome
that
presumption
to
prevail
an
invalidity
defense.
but
while
the
statute
states
the
burden
of
proof,
it
includes
no
express
articulation
of
the
standard
of
proof.
according
to
site
--
microsoft,
this
means
that
section
282
does
not
specify
the
applicable
standard
of
proof,
we
disagree.
where
congress
uses
a
common
law
term
in
a
statute,
we
assume
the
term
comes
with
a
common
law
meaning.
here,
by
stating
that
a
patent
is
presumed
valid,
congress
used
a
term
with
a
settled
meaning
in
the
common
law.
as
we
explained
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
by
the
time
congress
enacted
section
282,
the
presumption
of
patentability
have
long
been
a
fixture
of
the
common
law.
according
to
its
settled
meaning,
an
invalidity
defense
required
proof
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
we
cannot
conclude
that
congress
intended
to
drop
the
heightened
standard
of
proof
from
the
presumption
it
codified
simply
because
282
fails
to
reiterate
the
standard
expressly.
we
just
--
we
reject
microsoft's
arguments
to
the
contrary
--
contrary.
we
also
reject
microsoft's
argument
that
a
lower
standard
of
proof
should
apply
when
an
invalidity
defense
rest
on
evidence
that
the
pto
never
considered
like
the
s4
software
here.
the
hybrid
standard
of
proof
that
microsoft
envisions
was
not
a
part
of
the
common
law
presumption
of
patent
validity
and
nothing
in
282
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
adopt
it.
we
note
however
that
most
often,
a
jury
instruction
should
be
given
when
requested
and
warranted,
directing
the
jury
to
evaluate
whether
the
evidence
before
it
is
materially
new,
and
if
so,
to
consider
that
fact
in
determining
whether
invalidity
has
been
proved
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
we
are
in
no
position
to
judge
the
parties
opposing
views
as
of
the
wisdom
of
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard.
congress
specified
the
applicable
standard
of
proof
in
1952,
since
then
it
has
allowed
the
federal
circuit's
correct
interpretation
of
282
to
stand.
any
recalibration
of
the
standard
of
proof
remains
in
its
hands.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
the
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia
and
alito
joined.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
the
chief
justice
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
