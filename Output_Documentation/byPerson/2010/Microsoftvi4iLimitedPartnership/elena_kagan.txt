but
justice
cardozo
certainly
didn't
limit
his
holding
in
the
way
you
suggest.
the
language
of
that
opinion
is
extremely
broad.
and
if
you
read
that
opinion,
no
one
would
gather
from
that
opinion
the
kinds
of
limits
that
you're
suggesting
on
it.

well,
mr.
hungar,
it
seems
to
me
that
rca
would
matter,
even
under
your
view
of
the
world,
because
if
you
think
that
congress
did
not
codify
the
existing
state
of
the
law
as
to
the
standard
of
proof
and
you
think
that
congress
--
that
--
that
section
282
was
essentially
silent
as
to
the
standard
of
proof,
then
the
question
is,
what
do
we
do?
and
one
answer
to
that
question
is
we
go
with
our
prior
precedent,
which
is
rca.

mr.
waxman--
justice

--isn't
there
a
limited
amount
of
reliance
that
any
patent
holder
can
have,
given
the
re-exam
system?
