it
would
be
hard
to
argue,
mr.
hungar,
that
it
makes
no
sense,
but
it
made
sense
to
cardozo
and
judge
rich.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
just
taking
rca
itself,
cardozo
said
through
all
the
verbal
variances
there
runs
this
common
core
of
thought
and
truth,
that
one
otherwise
an
infringer
who
assails
the
validity
of
a
patent
bears
--
upon
its
face,
bears
a
heavy
burden
of
persuasion
and
fails
unless
his
evidence
has
more
than
a
dubious
preponderance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
--
then
you
have
to
be
saying
that
judge
rich
got
it
wrong
because
he
does
deal
with
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
--
it
--
it
is
true
that
the
federal
circuit
has
been
consistent
now
since
almost
the
beginning,
since
that
court
came
on
the
scene,
and
it
does
have
a
monopoly
on
appeal
in
patent
cases
since
1984.
because
the
--
the
federal
circuit
has
consistently
taken
this
position,
one
would
have
expected
that
there
would
have
been
bills
proposed
to
change
it.
were
there
any?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hungar,
could
we
go
back
to
the
statute
that
was
enacted
in
1952.
before
that
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
issue
of
validity
of
the
patent
or
the
effect
of
the
patent,
that
was
on
the
challenger.
so
when
congress
added
a
presumption
of
validity,
it
must
have
had
in
mind
something
more
than
the
defendant
would
have
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
normal
standard
is
preponderance.
so
by
adding
a
presumption
of
validity,
must
congress
have
intended
to
do
something
more
than
simply
repeat
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
actively
do
we
acquiesce?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
agree,
looking
to
judge
rich's
opinions,
that
it
would
have
been
in
order
for
the
judge
to
instruct,
if
the
judge
had
been
asked
to
do
so,
that
the
evidence
would
carry
more
weight
if
it
hadn't
been
presented,
defendant's
evidence
would
carry
more
weight
if
it
hadn't
been
presented
to
the
patent
office?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
but
why
--
why
--
why
not,
mr.
waxman?
if
the
whole
reason
for
this
extra
deference,
for
this
clear
and
convincing
standard
is
a
patent
office
is
expert
and
so
we
defer
juries
similarly
to
defer
to
their
judgment,
but
if
they
haven't
judged
anything,
what
is
the
justification
for
continuing
to
have
the
clear
and
convincing
standard?
