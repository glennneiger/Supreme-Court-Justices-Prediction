we'll
hear
argument
now
in
case
no.
10-290,
microsoft
corporation
v.
i4i
limited
partnership.
mr.
hungar,
you
may
proceed.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can't
keep
shifting
horses,
now.
are
you
going
to
argue
for
all
the
time,
in
which
case,
you
can
appeal
to
the
general
rule
that
we
always
apply,
or
are
you
going
to
say,
oh,
yes,
we
won't
apply
it
normally
but
only
when
the
prior
art
hadn't
been
considered?
i
mean,
you
--
you
can't
ride
both
horses.
they're
going
in
different
directions.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you're
contradicting
cardozo?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waxman.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
would
like
that
notion
of
active
acquiescence.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
like
passive
activity,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
the
instruction
that
you've
proposed
to
the
jury,
like
your
adversary's
proposition,
would
require
determining
what
it
was
that
the
patent
office
considered.
so
you
--
you
haven't
avoided
the
--
the
--
the
problem
of
litigating
an
--
an
issue
that
--
that
would
better
be
avoided.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
do
it
for
your
instruction
just
as
--
as
he
will
have
to
do
it
for
his.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
your
--
but
your
instruction
requires
that,
too.
you're
inviting
the
parties
to
litigate
that
issue
so
that
the
jury
can
be
instructed.
if
you
--
if
you
find
that
it
wasn't
considered,
you
can
give
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--finish
your
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia

you,
mr.

hear
from
you

for
rebuttal.
