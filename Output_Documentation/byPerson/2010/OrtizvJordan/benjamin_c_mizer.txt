mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
think
the
discussion
has
already
demonstrated,
ms.
ortiz's
question
presented
hinges
on
a
false
assumption.
that
assumption
is
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
reviewing
the
summary
judgment
order
as
the
final
appealable
order
in
this
case.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
i
think
that
the
sixth
circuit's
word
choice
in
the
sentence
that
you
just
read
was
not
perfectly
clear.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
actually,
your
honor,
the
summary
judgment
motion
was
only
one
of
several
orders
listed
in
the
notice
of
appeal.
and
the
sixth
circuit
brief
was
couched
as
an
appeal
from
the
verdict,
which
at
the
bottom
of
the
prior
page
of
the
petition
appendix,
from
where
justice
kennedy
just
read,
the
bottom
of
page
7a,
the
sixth
circuit
calls
it
an
"appeal
from
the
jury
verdict".
and
then
the
sixth
circuit
at
petition
appendix
2a
and
throughout
its
opinion
refers
to
"trial
evidence".
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
i
think
that
what
the
sixth
circuit
meant
there
was
that
the
issue
of
qualified
immunity
raised
in
summary
judgment
was
preserved.
i
don't
think
its
word
choice
was
perfectly
clear,
but
i
think
other
phrases
in
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
make
clearer
that
what
it
was
doing
was
viewing
the
full
trial
record.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
well,
and
i
don't
think
the
sixth
circuit
was
saying
it
was
reviewing
the
summary
judgment
record,
and
that
would
have
been
not
appropriate.
what
it
was
doing
was
looking
at
the
whole
record.
and
a
legal
issue
doesn't
have
to
be
raised
post-trial
in
order
for
it
to
have
been
adequately--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--to
the
extent--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--partly,
yes,
your
honor.
to
the
extent
the
argument
is
that
there
needed
to
be
a
50(b)
motion--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--in
your
hypothetical?
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
this
court's
case
law
concerning
--
the
mitchell
line
of
cases
concerning
collateral
order
appeals
in
the
qualified
immunity
context
divides
qualified
immunity
claims
into
two
halves.
there
are
evidentiary
sufficiency-based
qualified
immunity
claims,
and
there
are
legal
claims.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
that
because
it
is
a
difficult
question,
it
should
have
been
raised
by
ms.
ortiz
properly,
and
she
hasn't
raised
a
50(b)
argument
properly.
but
even
if
the
court
were
to
reach
it,
i
think
the
clearer
rule
is
to
map
the
johnson
line
onto
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
line
for
50(b)
motions.
otherwise--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--because
the
converse
rule,
your
honor,
would
create
even
more
difficulties.
on
ms.
ortiz's--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--and
that
argument
is
a
different
species
of
argument
than
the
argument
on
which
--
than
the
reasoning
on
which
the
sixth
circuit
resolved
the
case,
which
is,
even
assuming
all
the
facts
as
given
by
ms.
ortiz
and
taking,
treating
those
facts
as
uncontroverted,
still
there
was
not
a
violation
of
clearly
established
law.
and
under
johnson
v.
jones
and
mitchell,
that
is
a
different
question
than
from
the
question
of
whether
or
not
particular
conduct
has
been
proven.
as--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--that
is
our
position,
yes,
your
honor,
because
a
legal
issue
is
adequately
preserved
once
it's
pressed
and
passed
on
in
the
district
court.
and
to
move
for
summary
judgment
on
the
issue
is
enough
to
preserve
a
legal
claim,
the
legal
claim
being
not
that
particular
--
that
sufficient
evidence
exists
to
prove
that
particular
conduct
occurred,
but
rather
that
the
--
given
all
of
that,
that
claim
as
assumed,
still,
the
harlow
line
of
objective
legal
reasonableness
has
not
been
crossed.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
there
was
a
requested
instruction
regarding
qualified
immunity,
yes,
and
it
was
not
given.
we
are
not
arguing
that
that--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
instruction
was
about
the
objective
legal
reasonableness
standard
under
harlow.
i
actually
don't
think
that
that
request
was
proper--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--i
don't
have
a
cite
to
the
record
at
the
moment.
but
the
point
is
that
actually,
that
instruction
wasn't
proper,
because
the
jury
doesn't
resolve
the
harlow
objective
legal
reasonableness
question.
instead,
the
jury
resolves
the
disputed
facts,
and
then
the
court
takes
those
facts
as
a
given
for
purposes
of
the
harlow
question.
and
in
this
case,
i
think
there
is
an
example
of
this
distinction.
there
was
very
much
disputed
at
trial
the
question
of
whether
ms.
ortiz
told
ms.
jordan
the
name
of
the
guard
who
had
assaulted
her.
and
that
fact
was
disputed
at
trial.
we
didn't
move
for
50(b)
over
that
factual
dispute
and
so
we
couldn't
appeal
on
that
question.
but
what
we
did
appeal
was
that,
taking
that
fact
as
assumed
for
purposes
of
the
qualified
immunity
question,
still
qualified
immunity
was
warranted.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
i'm
not
aware
of
a
reason,
your
honor.
but
at
pages
4
to
5
of
the
joint
appendix,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
there
were
two
different
types
of
arguments
being
made
at
the
50(a)
stage.
one
argument
was
the
dispute
over
facts.
the
other
argument
was,
even
if
we
don't
dispute
those
facts,
still
ms.
ortiz's
arguments
haven't
shown
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
but
still,
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
of
whether
particular
conduct
has
been
proven
is
a
sufficiency
question,
and
that
differs
in
nature
from
the
question
of
whether,
taking
that
proven
conduct
as
a
given,
assuming
it
to
be
true,
without
--
without
questioning
the
correctness
of
the
plaintiffs'
version
of
the
facts,
that
the
--
then
the
harlow
question
is
a
separate
question.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case,
no,
although
i
am
aware
of
cases
including
the
k
&
t
enterprises
case
from
the
seventh
--
or
sorry,
from
the
sixth
circuit,
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
which
says
that
legal
claims,
purely
legal
claims
may
be
raised
in
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
motions
under
either
50(a)
or
50(b),
but
that
50(b)
is
not
required
with
respect
to
those
motions.
and
so
--
so
the
50(a)
motion
here
was
a
belts
and
--
belt
and
suspenders
effort,
but
it
wasn't
legally
required
because
of
the
--
the--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
--
the
sixth
circuit
held
in
this
case
that
the
retaliation
claim
is
a
different
claim
from
the
due
process
claim,
that
it
would
be
based
on--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
first
amendment
or
some
other
amendment.
and--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
our
position
is
that
the
sixth
circuit
got
it
right,
and
ms.
ortiz
hasn't
appealed
to
this
court
on
that
holding,
that
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
law
under
sandin,
placing
an
individual
in
segregated
confinement
does
not
amount
to
a
due
process
violation
vis
a
vis
the
--
the
ordinary
conditions
of
prison
confinement.
i
also
have
an
answer,
justice
sotomayor,
to
your
question
about
the
--
the
jury
instruction
request.
it's
in
document
84
in
the
district
court
record.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
the
--
the
medical
treatment
claims
were
dismissed
by
the
district
court
at
summary
judgment
because
ms.
bright
did
not
participate
and
did
not
have
any
knowledge
of--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--and
again,
on
the
question
of
punitiveness
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
that
was
not
preserved
--
that
claim
was
not
preserved
by
ms.
ortiz
and
she
has
not
petitioned
to
this
court
for
review
of
that
holding
by
the
sixth
circuit.
and
so
the
only
question
is
the
square
sandin
question
of
whether
segregated
confinement
is
an
atypical
and
significant
hardship
vis
a
vis
the
routine
conditions
of
--
of
her
confinement.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
the
--
again,
the
sixth
circuit's
holding
was
that
sandin
answered
that
--
that
question
as
a
matter
of
clearly
established
law,
and
since
ms.
ortiz
hasn't
petitioned
for
review
on
the
merits
of
that
question,
i'm
not
sure
how
it's
presented
to
this
court.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
i
think
unitherm
was
more
squarely
the
latter,
although
the
court
did
refer
to
the
seventh
amendment
in
responding
to
justice
stevens'
dissent.
and
the
seventh
amendment
concerns
i
don't
think
are
implicated
here,
because
it
is
well
established
that
legal
claims
like
qualified
immunity
are
not
for
the
jury
to
resolve.
and
so
taking
--
taking
the
case
away
from--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--and
i
think
those
--
those
categorization
are
--
are
fairly
slippery
and
would
be
difficult
to
apply,
as
i
think
the
chief
justice
suggested.
so
the
guidance
that
is
clear
is
the
guidance
that
already
exists
from
johnson
v.
jones,
which
is
that
there
are
--
there
two
types
of
qualified
immunity
claims
and
if
you
are
assuming
the
facts
to
be
true
as
the
plaintiff
posits
them,
and
you
are
not
controverting
particular
conduct,
then
you
are
in
the
legal--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--well,
qualified
immunity
is
always
going
to
be
an
application
of
clearly
established
law
through
fact.
and
mitchell
notes
that
--
that
there
will
be
some--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--and
that
is--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--and
as
this
court
has
called
it,
that
is
correct
and
that
is
this
case.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
it's
different,
your
honor,
because
the
--
the
prong
of
the
analysis
in
the
deliberate
indifference
conduct
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
looking
at
was
the
objective
prong
of
whether
or
not
the
response
was
reasonable.
so
assuming
all
of
the
worst
of
--
of
ms.
jordan's
intent,
as
proven
by
the
trial
record,
and
assuming
the
worst
of
what
she
did
or
didn't
do,
still
her
response
was
as
a
legal
matter
objectively
reasonable,
and
that
was
the
sixth
circuit's
holding.
and
so
therefore,
because
that's
a
legal
inquiry,
there
was
no
50(b)
requirement
even
if
ms.
ortiz
had
preserved
the
50(b)
argument.
the
--
the
--
ms.
ortiz
has
also
posited
that
a
collateral
order
appeal
is
a
requirement
in
order
to
preserve
a
qualified
immunity
claim.
that
argument
is
clearly
foreclosed
not
only
by
the
broad
agreement
among
the
circuits,
but
also
this
court's
decisions
in
united
states
v.--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
court
said
that
you
had
can
raise
in
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
motion
legal
arguments
like
the
statute
of
limitations,
collateral
estoppel,
preemption.
very
often--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--that
would
work
just
fine
from
our
perspective,
your
honor,
and
in
fact--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--if
rule
50(b)
--
if
rule
50(a)
and
50(b)
motions
were
required
for
all
matters
of
law,
then
that
would
change
the
hornbook
understanding
of
what
50(b)
is
about.
it
would
expand
the
unitherm
requirement
in
ways
that
it
hasn't
been
applied
before,
and
it
would
turn
rule
50(b)
motions
into
a
clearinghouse
for
anything
that
must
be
raised
--
that
is
going
to
be
raised
on
appeal.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
your
honor,
because
it
would
radically
change
the
way
that
50(b)
is
currently
treated
by
parties.
if
it,
for
example,
in
the
surgeon
district
of
ohio,
where
this
case--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--because,
your
honor,
the
rule
50(b)
motions
would
then
become
miniature
--
or
not
even
miniature
--
full-blown
appellate
briefs.
and
the
ruling
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio
at
the
moment,
for
example,
is
that
rule
50(b)
motions
are
20
pages
long.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
because,
your
honor,
the
district
courts
have
never
insisted,
nor
do
the
rules
insist,
that
the
district
courts
get
multiple
cracks
at
a
legal
question.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
but
if
a
claim
is
not
in
a
case,
your
honor,
then
there
is
no
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
to
give
it
to
the
jury.
so
just
as
the
qualified
immunity
question
doesn't
belong
with
the
jury,
so,
too,
a
claim
that
hasn't
been
adequately
pressed
doesn't
go
to
the
jury.
so
we
are
not
talking
about
questions
that
should
and
can
be
resolved
by
the
jury.
we
are
talking
about
legal
claims
that
the
jury
has
no
business
deciding--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--i
would
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
as
resolving
factual
questions,
because
on
the
contrary,
i
think--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--that's
correct.
and
so
it's
the
--
the--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--that
goes
to
show,
your
honor,
that
the
sixth
circuit
wasn't
doing
what
ms.
ortiz
has
--
what
ms.
ortiz
has
posited,
which
is
that
they
were
reviewing
the
summary
judgment
record
order.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
yes.
then
it
would
be
like
a
late
collateral
order
appeal.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
again,
i
would
disagree
that
that's
what
the
sixth
circuit
said
because
of
the
language
at
the
bottom
of
page
7a
of
the
petition
appendix,
where
they
clearly
say
that
there
is
an
appeal
from
the
verdict.
and
so
because
it's
demonstrably
not
true
that
they
were
treating
the
summary
judgment
order
as
the
final
appealable
order
here,
the
question
presented
by
ms.
ortiz
is
not
actually
presented
by
this
case.
and
the
further
argument
that
a
50(b)
motion
was
required
here
under
unitherm
were
never
made
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
not
made
in
her
opening
cert
petition,
and
so
that
argument
also
was
not
presented
by
this
case.
and
so
i
think
the
clear
resolution
is
to
dismiss
the
case
as
improvidently
granted,
but
if
the
court
were
inclined
to
view
that
the
merits
should
be
breached,
then
the
clear
rule
that
we
posit
resolves
the
case,
which
is
that
orders
made
by
the
district
court
along
the
way
in
the
course
of
a
district
court
proceeding
are
adequately
preserved
for
appellate
review
from
the
final
judgment
once
they
are
pressed
and
passed
on
below
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
once
they
are
pressed
and
passed
on
by
the
district
court,
and
the
qualified
immunity
claim
here
was
pressed
and
passed
on--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
lower
courts,
i
think,
are
well-equipped
to
assess
whether
or
not
an
issue
has
adequately
been
pressed
and
passed
on
in
the
district
court.
that
has
been
the
settled
rule
of
appellate
reviewability,
and
i
don't
think
that
it
should
be
changed
by
imposing
a
rule
50(b)
requirement
for
anything
other
than
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
motion.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
ask
you
to
affirm
the
sixth
circuit.
thank
you.
