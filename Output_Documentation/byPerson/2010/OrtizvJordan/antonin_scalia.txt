but
that's
not
the
point
that
you
have
made
here,
i
mean,
and
that
is
not
the
point
on
which
we
granted
certiorari.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
have
to
know
what
it
was.
it
assumes
it
to
be
what
--
what
the
plaintiff
claims
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
summary
judgment,
you
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
is
always
a
factual
element
to
the
--
to
the
ruling.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
never
going
to
be
any
better
than
what
you
assumed.
it's
never
going
to
be
any
better
for
the
plaintiff
than
what
you
assumed
at
the
summary
judgment
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
--
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
was
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
johnson
line
isn't
much
of
a
map,
is
what
the
chief
justice
is
suggesting.
it's
a
mess.
it's
very
hard
to
sort
those
things
out.
why
should
we
double
the
difficulty
by
--
by
bringing
it
in
at
the
rule
50(b)
stage
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
all
you
have
to
do
--
any
lawyer
going
in
knows
he
has
to
make
the
motion
at
the
close
of
the
evidence.
what's
the
big
deal?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
seem
to
concede
that
50(a)
only
--
only
applies
to
evidentiary
stuff?
i
mean,
what
we
agree
is
if
during
a
trial
by
jury,
a
party
has
been
fully
heard
and
there
is
no
legally
sufficient
evidentiary
basis
for
a
reasonable
jury
to
find
for
that
party
on
that
issue,
well,
as
a
matter
of
law,
no
amount
of
evidence
would
ever
allow
a
jury
verdict
in
that
direction.
surely
that
falls
within
(a),
even
though
evidence
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
no
matter
what
the
evidence
is,
this
is
simply
a
matter
of
law.
no
jury,
no
reasonable
jury,
could
find
for
that
party
on
that
issue.
i
don't
read
this
as
being
purely
a
--
you
know,
a
provision
governing
whether
there
is
enough
evidence
in
an
area
where
there
is
no
absolute
rule
of
law.
i
think
it
applies
to
the
absolute
rule
of
law
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
point
would
be
that
therefore,
you
don't
have
to
sort
out
whether
there
is
any
factual
content
to
this
issue.
you
don't
have
to
sort
out
what's
a
pure
question
of
law
and
what
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
which
is
always
very
difficult.
what's
the
big
deal?
make
the
motion.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
assumed
all
the
evidence
in
their
favor
at
the
summary
judgment
stage.
so
do
you
really
think
that
this
is
a
realistic
scenario
where
there's
going
to
be
even
more
evidence
against
them
than
--
i
mean,
you
are
assuming
the
evidence
against
them.
there
is
going
to
be
even
more
evidence
against
them
than
they
assumed
at
summary
judgment?
that's
not
going
to
happen
very
often.
