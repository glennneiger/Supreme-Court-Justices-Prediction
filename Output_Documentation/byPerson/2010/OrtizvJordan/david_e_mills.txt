mr.
david
e.
mills
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
denial
of
summary
judgment
is
not
reviewable
on
appeal
after
trial,
especially
where
the
decision
depends
on
whether
the
evidence
on
the
merits
of
the
claim
is
sufficient
to
cross
the
legal
line
for
liability.
in
this
case--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--well,
there's
a
difference
between
defenses
that
depend
on
the
evidence
at
trial.
what
i
would
say
about
qualified
immunity
is
that
to
the
extent
any
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
enter
judgment
based
on
qualified
immunity,
it
needs
to
understand
the
conduct
of
the
officials
in
the
case.
and
so
you're
always
talking
about
the
evidence
of
that
conduct.
mr.
david
e.
mills
that
is
--
that
is
an
issue
of
law,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
mills
well,
and
that
gets
to
what
i
think
is
the
heart
of
the
split
in
the
circuits
and
the
confusion,
is
that
every
circuit
recognizes
a
very
general
rule
that
where
the
evidence
at
trial
moots
that
at
summary
judgment
we
are
not
going
to
review
the
summary
judgment
decision.
now,
a
number
of
courts
said:
well,
wait
a
second;
there
are
summary
judgment
issues
that
don't
depend
on
the
evidence.
those
are
typically
called
questions
of
law,
and
respondents
point
to
a
number
of
good
examples
in
their
brief
of
defenses
such
as
statute
of
limitations,
preemption,
and
the
like,
that
indeed
very
often
don't
depend
at
all
on
the
evidence
at
trial.
the
difference
with
qualified
immunity
is
that
qualified
immunity
requires
the
court
to
look
at
the
evidence
of
the
claim
itself.
now,
statute
of
limitations,
for
example,
is
actually
quite
different,
because
in
statute
of
limitations
--
let's
suppose
michelle
ortiz
filed
her
suit
20
years
late.
it
would
not
matter
at
all
how
much
evidence
she
adduced
of
the
respondents'
misconduct.
it
would
be
barred
by
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
david
e.
mills
well,
i
think
that's
largely
--
largely
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and
here's
an
example
of
what
did
change
in
this
case.
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
what
we
had
were
affidavits
of
the
respondents
discussing
their
role
in
relation
to
this
case,
with
no
comment
whatsoever
about
what
the
consequences
would
have
been
had
ms.
jordan
immediately
reported
the
first
sexual
assault.
the
record
was
bare
at
summary
judgment
from
respondents'
perspective
on
that
point.
at
trial,
under
cross-examination
ms.
bright
testified
that
respondent
jordan
indeed
violated
prison
policy
by
not
reporting
it
and
then,
very
crucially,
also
agreed
that
the
second,
more
violent
assault
would
have
actually
been
precluded
had
that
report
taken
place.
now,
that's--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--well,
there's
a
couple
points
in
there
that
i
need
to
address.
first,
i
think
that
you
are
exactly
right.
what
the
sixth
circuit
did
here
is
it
reviewed
a
summary
judgment
decision,
but
it
did
peek
ahead
to
the
trial
evidence,
and
it
said
it
was
doing
that.
i
think
that
highlights
the
fundamental
problem
of
reviewing
summary
judgment
after
the
trial.
the
sixth
circuit
is
implicitly
recognizing
it
would
be
illogical
to
look
at
that
summary
judgment
record,
those
affidavits,
and
then
ignore
this
cross-examined
testimony--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--and
i
agree
with
that
last
point.
but
here's
the
problem
and
here's
why
it
isn't
just
simply
a
slip
of
the
pen
that
can
be
fixed
by
remanding.
even
if
this
was
not
summary
judgment
whatsoever
and
it
was,
as
respondents
say,
essentially
a
rule
50(a)
review,
that
conflicts
with
an
entire
line
of
this
court's
decisions
leading
into
unitherm
which
makes
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
absolutely
lacks
the
power
to
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
where
that
question
wasn't
ruled
upon
by
the
district
court.
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
here,
regardless
of
any
sort
of
forfeiture
argument,
absolutely
lacked
the
power
to
consider
it.
the
additional
point
about
your--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--that's
right
and
i
think
--
i
think
what
i
just
said
about
the
50(b)
point
is
that
i
think
it
highlights
that
this
really
was
a
summary
judgment
review
by
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
david
e.
mills
i
do
concede
it,
except
to
the
extent
that
i
concede
they
did
an
adequate
review
of
the
record.
but
i
concede
that
point.
for
example--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--there
are
certainly
a
number
of
instances
where
they
definitely
are
talking
about
the
trial.
i
do
think
it
is
even
muddy
the
extent
to
which
they
are
incorporating
trial
facts
with
summary
judgment
facts.
the
example
i
gave
about
this
point
where
mrs.
bright
conceded
on
cross
that
ms.
ortiz
indeed
would
have
been
separated
and
the
assault,
second
assault,
precluded,
it's
one
of
two
things.
either
the
sixth
circuit's
reviewing
summary
judgment
and
picking
a
couple
of
trial
facts
it
thinks
helps
to
review
and
missing
the
facts;
or
it's
doing
--
it's
looking
ahead
at
these
trial
facts
and
because
--
particularly
because
the
district
court
never
weighed
in
on
that,
on
a
rule
50(b),
it's
botching
the
record.
and
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
court's
cases
from
cone
v.
west
virginia
pulp
&
paper
in
1947
up
through
unitherm,
which
says
we
have
to
have
the
district
court
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
before
the
court
of
appeals
could
even
have
the
power
to
possibly
consider
this.
mr.
david
e.
mills
your
honor,
i
am
not
disputing
that
the
sixth
circuit
had
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
case.
but
i
am
making
a
distinction
among
jurisdiction
and
power,
and
it's
the
same
distinction
actually
the
tenth
circuit
employed
in
a
case
called
williams
v.
gonterman,
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
i
think
it's
at
page
10.
but
the
exact
issue
came
up,
where
the
verdict
loser
said:
wait
a
second;
this
issue's
been
forfeited.
the
tenth
circuit,
reading
unitherm,
reading
the
debate
between
the
majority
and
the
dissenters,
who
said
plain
error
and
those
doctrines
should
apply,
said:
we
lack
the
power
to
review
this;
we
have
jurisdiction,
but
we
lack
the
power.
mr.
david
e.
mills
it's
not
waived
because,
while
the
general
principle
is
that
claims
processing
rules
are
indeed
subject
to
waiver
and
forfeiture,
in
this
particular
context,
as
this
court
has
made
clear,
that
the
word
"power"
is
not
an
accidental
use.
it's
been
used
in
all
these
cases.
mr.
david
e.
mills
well,
justice
ginsburg,
you
are
absolutely
correct
and
i
think
that
footnote
4
of
unitherm
goes
right
to
your
point.
in
footnote
4
of
unitherm,
the
court
explains
that
the
very
reason
a
court
of
appeals
lacks
the
power,
lacks
the
power
to
review
that
question,
is
because
it
is
essentially,
as
in
unitherm,
going
to
be
as
a
court
of
appeals
reviewing
the
conduct
--
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
without
a
district
court
ruling
on
the
question.
and
this
court
said
in
unitherm
that
that
raises
serious
seventh
amendment
concerns.
this
case
is
actually
a
very
good
example--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--justice
alito,
that
highlights
another
important
point
about
this
exchange,
and
that
is
that
respondents
in
the
sixth
circuit
did
not
suggest
that
the
sixth
circuit
did
have
the
authority
to
take
the
summary
judgment
question
and
then
look
ahead
to
trial
facts.
and
so,
the
sixth
circuit
has
taken
the
summary
judgment
decision
and
then
acted
without
authority
to
look
ahead
at
the
trial
facts.
and
so
if
the
argument
is
that
we
have
forfeited
a
preemptive
argument
to
the
sixth
circuit
that
it
couldn't
do
this
frankly
very
unorthodox
approach,
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
proper
invocation
of
forfeiture
even
regardless
of
the
point
about
power.
mr.
david
e.
mills
well,
i
think
if
that
order
were
given
they
would
indeed
do
that.
but
i
would
still
come
back
to
the
point
that
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
on
which
they
would
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
and
the
point
is
in
the
unitherm
line
of
cases
that
if
you
don't
have
a
district
court
ruling
on
the
very
question,
the
question
here
of
whether
their
conduct,
as
they
say
crossed,
the
constitutional
line,
you're
circumventing
the
district
court's
role
in
the
entire
process.
as
this
court's
explained
repeatedly,
a
requisite
of
a
court
of
appeals
reviewing
that
evidence
that
went
to
the
jury
is
that
the
district
court
first,
who
has
the
feel
of
the
case,
who
saw
the
witnesses,
who
saw
respondent
bright
on
cross-examination,
first
have
the
opportunity
in
the
judge's
discretion
to
grant
a
new
trial.
mr.
david
e.
mills
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
see
this
case
is
it's
indeed
a
review
of
the
summary
judgment
decision.
that's
the
only
decision
by
the
district
court
that
had
to
do
with
qualified
immunity.
the
sixth
circuit
expressly
invoked
an
exception
to
say,
we
can
review
summary
judgment
after
the
trial
because
its
qualified
immunity
and
the
eighth
circuit
said
that's
okay
and
we
say
that's
okay,
we
are
looking
ahead
at
trial
facts.
and
i
think
what
this
court
can
and
should
conclude
is
that
it's
improper
to
review
the
summary
judgment
decision
after
trial
because
the
facts
have
changed.
mr.
david
e.
mills
that
is
my
argument,
with
a
couple
key
pieces
--
first
of
all,
they
could
of
course
take
a
collateral
order
appeal.
but
if
they
proceed
to
trial
--
and
here's
--
here's
sort
of
the
fundamental
point
about
qualified
immunity.
sure,
there
are
purely
legal
questions
in
the
qualified
immunity
inquiry.
was
the
right
clearly
established?
but
to
enter
judgment,
to
enter
judgment,
whether
it's
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
that
court
must
know
what
the
conduct
is.
mr.
david
e.
mills
well,
it's
certainly
a
less
compelling
case
than
this
one
where
the
facts
indeed
change.
but
i
would
say
that
there
--
it's
not
utterly
pointless
because
the
50(b)
motion
still
invokes
all
the
protections
that
this
court
has
described
where
the
district
court,
who
had
the
feel
of
the
case,
gets
the
first
chance
to
consider
whether
a
new
trial
should
be
granted.
mr.
david
e.
mills
it
--
it
would
still
mean
you
would
have
to
reverse
in
this
case,
and
i
think
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical
perhaps,
perhaps
not.
but
in
this
case,
as
--
as
respondents
themselves
say,
the
question
here
is
actually
very
simple.
it's
whether
their
conduct
crossed
a
constitutional
line.
and
the
point
is
that,
even
in
the
qualified
immunity
inquiry,
the
question
is
does
the
conduct
--
and
that's
conduct
in
one
way
at
summary
judgment
and
another
way
at
trial
--
does
that
conduct
cross
a
clearly
established
constitutional
line.
mr.
david
e.
mills
you
are
absolutely
right.
and
at
summary
judgment
officers
are
entitled
to
invoke
immunity
and
they
are
entitled
to
take
that
immediate
appeal,
and
it's
typically
--
well,
required
under
johnson
v.
jones
that
it
be
what
this
court's
called
a
question
of
law.
the
defendants
assume
the
facts
against
them
and
they
say
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
may
be
a
purely
legal
question,
like
this
isn't
clear
--
this
is
clearly
established,
or
isn't
clearly
established.
but
to
--
to
say
whether
that
line
is
crossed,
i
mean,
as
recently
as
iqbal
this
court's--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--well,
i'm
saying
it
--
it's
like
that
case
to
the
extent
that
the
court
still
has
to
understand,
if
it's
going
to
enter
judgment,
what
the
conduct
was.
even
if
it's
looking
at
purely--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
mills
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
mills
that's
right.
and
i
--
i
think
that
bolsters
my
point.
there
is
always
a
factual
element
to
the
ruling.
and
so
when
you
go
to
trial
and
you
put
on
a
trial
that
is
all
about
respondents'
conduct,
and
you
have
them
under
cross-examination
and
that
evidence
grows
of
their
misconduct,
then
we
are
talking
about
a
situation
where
they--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--your
honor,
it
actually
was
in
this
case.
mr.
david
e.
mills
it
actually
was
better
at
trial
in
this
case
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
david
e.
mills
it
was
--
one
example
i
gave
earlier:
ms.
ortiz
before
trial
didn't
have
knowledge
of
what
would
have
happened
had
mrs.
jordan
not
violated
prison
procedures
and
immediately
reported
the
first
assault.
on
cross-examination,
however,
mrs.
bright
at
page
242
of
the
trial
transcript
said:
"the
second
assault,
the
violent
assault,
would
have
been
precluded.
"
now,
it
seems
to
me,
again
reading
the
cold
transcript--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--not
that
they
would
have
put
her
in
segregation,
but
that
they
would
have
taken
steps
to
separate
her
from
the
officer,
whether
that
meant
removing
the
officer
from
the
location
or
putting
her
in
another
cell.
the
important
piece
of
that
is
not
only
did
it
change
from
summary
judgment
to
trial;
the
sixth
circuit
got
it
entirely
wrong.
mr.
david
e.
mills
that
is
not
something
ms.
ortiz
would
have
knowledge
of.
mr.
david
e.
mills
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
mills
that's
absolutely
right.
and--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
just
can't
see
how
ms.
ortiz
would
have
an
obligation
to
put
in
some
fact
that
is
outside
of
her
knowledge
and,
frankly,
something
that
came
out
when
a
respondent
caved
in
a
bit
on
cross-examination.
mr.
david
e.
mills
i
think
that
--
that's
a
fair
way
to
state
it.
mr.
david
e.
mills
well--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--yes,
indeed.
i
think
it
has
been
thought
about.
i
think
it's
been
thought
about
really
by
every
circuit,
when
they
recognize
the
very
basic
principle
that
the
real
evidence
of
the
case
is
the
evidence
at
the
trial,
and
what
that
means
is
that
if
the
evidence
at
the
trial
goes
to
the
question
at
summary
judgment,
whatever
that
legal
issue
may
be,
it
is
illogical
to
ignore
exactly
what
happened
at
trial
and
go
back
to
summary
judgment.
mr.
david
e.
mills
yes.
mr.
david
e.
mills
yes.
mr.
david
e.
mills
yes,
i
think
it
is.
i
think
it
is
the
basic
horn
rule--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--our
claims
are
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law,
yes.
mr.
david
e.
mills
there
are
purely
legal
components
to
those
inquiries;
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
again,
a
purely
legal
question
might
be
what
is
the
constitutional
right;
is
it
clearly
established.
mr.
david
e.
mills
at
the
end
of
the
day
these
are
factual
inquiries
in
which
you
have
to
understand
the
officer's
conduct.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
second
component
to
establish
immunity
or
anything
else
does
include
always
a
pure
question
about
whether
the
right's
clearly
established.
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
to
assess
whether
that
line
has
been
crossed
you
have
to
understand
what
the
facts
are.
mr.
david
e.
mills
yes,
it
is,
because
that's
a
classic
sufficiency
challenge
at
rule
50,
to
assume
the
--
that's
what
rule
50
requires.
assume
the
facts
against
you
after
the
verdict's
come
back
and
now
say,
you
know,
what,
your
honor,
it
was
insufficient.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
david
e.
mills
thank
you.
one
thing
that's
important
about
the
sixth
circuit's
language
when
it
said
it
was
reviewing
summary
judgment,
the
single
decision
it
cited
was
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
in
goff
v.
bise.
now,
in
that
--
in
that
decision,
the
eighth
circuit
said
yeah,
we
can
review
this
after
trial
even
though
it
was
summary
judgment,
because
it's
qualified
immunity,
but
the
eighth
circuit
actually
ignored
the
trial
evidence.
it
actually
did
this
seemingly
illogical
step
of
just
looking
at
the
summary
judgment
evidence
as-is.
now,
i
think
what
that
shows
is
the
sixth
circuit
was
definitely
reviewing
summary
judgment
but
it,
implicitly
at
least,
recognized
that
would
be
entirely
illogical.
so
it
tied
its
decision
to
the
only
decision
by
the
district
court
on
qualified
immunity,
summary
judgment,
and
said:
we've
got
to
look
at
what
really
happened
in
this
case.
and
so
they
looked
ahead.
now,
the
reason
the
question
is
adequately
presented
is
because
i
think
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
shows
this
entire
debate
about
unitherm
and
whether
this
was
a
quasi-50(a)
review
is
one
of
the
precise
reasons
the
sixth
circuit
hinged
its
decision
on
summary
judgment.
i
think
it
was
quite
aware
that
an
appellate
court,
since
at
least
1947,
in
cone,
cannot
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
at
trial
and
overturn
the
jury's
verdict.
and
so
the
sixth
circuit
said:
wait
a
second;
we
can
look
to
the
summary
judgment
record.
now--
mr.
david
e.
mills
--yes.
the
answer
is
that
a
party
may
not
appeal
a
denial
of
summary
judgment
after
trial.
mr.
david
e.
mills
i
would
say
that
the
clearest
rule
is
to
say
that
in
no
circumstances.
that's
the
position
of
the
fourth
circuit.
you
say
if
you
want
counsel
judgment,
simply
make
your
motion.
but
i
would
add
that
whichever
way
this
court
goes,
the
decision
here
has
to
be
reversed,
because
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
legal
issue
of
qualified
immunity
at
summary
judgment
depended
entirely
on
the
officer's
conduct
at
trial.
mr.
david
e.
mills
it
would
only
require
it,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
they
wish
to
challenge
that
decision
on
the
summary
judgment
record.
i
am
not
at
all
suggesting
that
that
appeal
is
required
to
preserve
the
issue
of
immunity.
it's
easily
preserved,
but
to
the
extent
a
trial
occurs
on
the
officer's
conduct
and
the
officers
want
to
say:
wait
a
second,
we're
still
immune,
that
evidence
even
at
trial
is
insufficient
for
liability.
you
have
got
the
right
to
preserve
your
immunity
issue,
but
you
have
to
have
the
district
court
consider
the
question.
mr.
david
e.
mills
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
mills
well,
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
take
that
immediate
appeal
and
--
and
they
chose
not
to.
mr.
david
e.
mills
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
david
e.
mills
they
do
not
because
if
they
lose
the
appeal
and
they
go
to
trial,
you've
got
a
new
case.
you've
got
--
i
shouldn't
say
a
new
case.
you
have
got
new
evidence
of
conduct.
so
there
is
no
loss
of
the
issue
of
immunity.
it
is
just
that
it
turns
on
the
facts
from
the
trial.
mr.
david
e.
mills
it
happened
here.
