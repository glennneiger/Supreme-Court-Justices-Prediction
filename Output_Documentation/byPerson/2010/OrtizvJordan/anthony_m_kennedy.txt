well,
of
course
there
is
always
--
there
are
always
facts.
there
are
often
disputed
facts.
but
suppose
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
this
right
--
and
maybe
there
are
two
rights
here
--
this
right
was
clearly
established.
that
is
an
issue
of
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
doesn't
that
fall
within
the
"except"
clause
that
the
chief
justice
was
talking
to
you
about,
which
you
haven't
had
much
time
to
fill
out,
i
understand.
but
--
well,
if
you're
going
to
say
--
and
it's
really
not
whether
the
summary
judgment
is
appealed.
that's
a
little
bit
--
it's
whether
or
not
the
issues
resolved
by
the
summary
judgment
motion
are
appealable.
as
i
read
into
your
response
or
implied
from
your
response
to
what
the
chief
justice
said,
maybe
sometimes
the
summary
judgment
motion,
say
on
an
issue
of
law,
is
sufficient
to
preserve
the
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
except
that
it
begins,
2(a),
"although
courts
normally
do
not
review
the
denial
of
a
summary
judgment
motion
after
trial
on
the
merits,
the
denial
of
summary
judgment
based
on
qualified
immunity
is
an
exception
to
this
rule.
"
that's
the
opening.
that
sets
the
stage
for
what
follows.
and
it
may
be
that
everybody,
including
the
sixth
circuit,
misapprehended
the
rule
because
there
are
some
cases
that
depend
on
an
assessment
of
the
record
and
some
cases
that
don't,
but
that's
not
what
the
sixth
circuit
said.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
there
are
some
cases
in
which
the
failure
of
the
court
to
give
a
requested
instruction
preserves
the
issue,
and
perhaps
50(b)
is
not
required
there.
were
there
any
instructions
proffered
and
denied
in
this
case
that
would
have
preserved
the
issue
for
appeal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
way
to
make
the
formulation
work
is
to
say
whether
or
not
the
issue
depends
on
an
assessment
of
the
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
we
have
been
through
this.
i
think
it
was
justice
alito
gave
the
hypothetical,
suppose
everybody
agreed
on
what
happened,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
right's
clearly
established.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
pure
issue
of
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
hear
your
last
--
are
adequately
preserved
when?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
are
saying
that
if
there
is
anything
in
the
record
of
trial
that
indicates
the
judge
ruled
on
the
issue,
there
need
not
be
a
50(b)
motion?
