justice
elena
kagan
mr.
mills,
if
i
could
just
understand
your
answer
to
justice
alito.
you
concede
that
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
is
using
the
record
built
on
the
whole
trial
and
that
that's
a
different
record
from
the
record
that
existed
at
summary
judgment;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
so
they
have
that
first
paragraph
where
they
suggest
that
they're
ruling
on
a
summary
judgment
motion.
then
they
go
through
an
entire
opinion
that
talks
about
the
facts
and
the
record.
and
there
are
very
few
citations,
but
your
understanding
is
that
when
they
talk
about
the
facts
in
the
record
they
are
talking
about
the
post-trial,
i
mean
the
record
that
has
been
built
up
as
a
result
of
the
trial?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
mills,
when
--
when
unitherm
talks
about
the
district
court
feeling
the
case
and
having
a
feel
for
the
case,
it's
talking
about
having
ae
feel
for
the
evidence
and
for
the
facts.
the
whole
rationale
of
unitherm
is
based
on
the
evidence,
the
facts,
not
on
purely
legal
questions.
so
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
about
the
reach
of
unitherm.
suppose
we
say
unitherm
doesn't
have
any
application
to
purely
legal
questions.
what
would
that
mean
for
your
case?
which
part
of
your
claims
were
purely
legal
and
which
part
were
instead
founded
on
the
facts,
in
which
case
you
would
have
a
better
unitherm
argument?
justice
elena
kagan
and
mr.
mills,
if
that
were
the
basic
hornbook
rule,
your
claims
are
all
matters
of
fact
or
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law?
justice
elena
kagan
there
are
no
purely
legal
issues?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
i'm
asking
is
--
is
--
are
the
questions
that
you
have
those
sorts
of
questions,
or
are
they
factual
inquiries
that
would
fall
on
the
other
side
of
justice
breyer's
line?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
mizer,
you
asked
for
an
appeal
of
the
summary
judgment
motion,
so
they
might
have
chosen
their
words
based
on
your
request.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
mizer--
justice
elena
kagan
--is
it
this
case,
mr.
mizer?
take
the
deliberate
indifference
claim.
the
question
is
whether
the
conduct
amounted
to
deliberate
indifference.
why
is
that
any
different
from
asking
whether
a
particular
kind
of
conduct
amounted
to
negligence,
which
in
a
previous
case
this
court
said
you
had
did
have
to
make
50(b),
a
50(b)
motion
in
order
to
preserve.
that
was
in
the
johnson
v.
new
york
case.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
mizer,
suppose
that
they
were.
suppose
they
committed
an
error
in
that
respect,
and
they
thought
they
were
reviewing
the
summary
judgment
order
and
not
the
final
judgment.
if
that's
what
they
thought,
would
you
agree
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
at
that
point
to
take
that
appeal
because
the
30
days
had
run?
justice
elena
kagan
so
your
position
rests,
is
dependent,
on
our
finding
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
reviewing
the
final
judgment
order,
which
was
not
what
the
sixth
circuit
in
fact
said
it
was
doing.
