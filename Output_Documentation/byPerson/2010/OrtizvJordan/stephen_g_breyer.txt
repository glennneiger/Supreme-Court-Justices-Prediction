justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
would
you
put
the
rule
about
when
you
have
to
renew
a
motion?
you
move
for
summary
judgment.
can
you
say
this?
you've
looked
up
the
treatises
and
so
forth.
if
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
involves
either
a
question
of
fact
or
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
it
has
to
be
renewed.
if
it
involves
neither
of
the
others,
neither
of
those
two
things,
but
it's
a
pure
question
of
law
and
not
mixed,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
renewed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
authority
for
that?
i
mean,
is
there
any
--
it
seems
to
be
roughly
what
you
are
trying
to
argue,
roughly.
at
least
it
seems
to
me
a
rule
that
would
make
sense.
is
it
--
what
do
you
find
related
to
that?
it
seems
to
me
that
must
have
been
thought
about
before
this
minute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
necessarily
by
you,
but
by
somebody.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
--
let
--
let's
imagine
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
qualified
immunity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
bread
and
butter
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can't
appeal
a
denial
of
motion
for
summary
judgment.
but
there
is
a
trial
and
the
lawyer
forgets
to
renew
the
motion.
sometimes
he's
lost
it;
i
guess
sometimes
he
hasn't.
i
would
think
he
would
have
lost
it
if
it's
a
mixed
question
of
fact
or
law
or
if
it's
a
pure
question
of
fact
that
the
answer
turns
on.
i
would
think
he
hadn't
lost
it
if
in
fact
it
is
a
pure
question
of
law.
but
is
that
the
basic
hornbook
rule
out
of
this
context?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
surely
it
has
to
be
raised
post-trial
if
your
legal
argument
is:
look
at
the
facts;
the
facts
of
this
case
as
proved
do
not
support
liability.
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
that
was
a
classic
instance
where
you
do
have
to
make
the
motion.
that's
the
whole
point
of
having
to
renew
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
i
mean,
do
you
normally
--
forget
this
case.
what
the
lawyer
says
is:
judge,
they
are
never
going
to
be
able
to
prove
that
my
client
crossed
the
intersection.
okay,
we
go
to
trial.
at
trial,
he
wants
to
say:
we
heard
all
the
evidence
now
and
it
doesn't
show
my
client
crossed
the
intersection,
so
not
liable.
okay?
doesn't
he
have
to
renew
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
fine.
now,
how
is
yours
one
bit
different?
because
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
evidence,
when
you
look
at
it,
will
show
the
facts
are
such
that
there
must
have
been
qualified
immunity
under
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
when
you
go
back
--
you
are
the
one
who
read
these
cases
pretty
thoroughly,
and
as
i
looked
at
it,
i
--
with
the
incomplete
knowledge,
i
would
have
thought
that
justice
ginsburg's
statement
of
it
is
basically
right.
what
rule
50
is
about
is
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
and
50(a)
involves,
we
are
saying
it
won't
be
sufficient.
and
50(b)
involves
it
wasn't
sufficient.
then
you
could
have
the
chief
justice's
rule.
it
would
work
perfectly.
but
apparently
there
is
a
second
circuit
case
and
some
things
in
the
treatises
that
says
sometimes
rule
50(a)
is
being
used
for
some
other
purpose;
and
that's
what
seems
to
be
going
wrong.
like
if
you
have
a
pure
question
of
law,
you
ought
to
be
outside
50(a).
you
ought
to
be
doing
some
other
thing
in,
you
know,
a
question
like:
was
there
collateral
estoppel?
that
means
that
he
couldn't
say
he
was
a
policeman,
because
they
litigated
this
four
months
ago.
it's
a
pure
question
of
law.
so
what
are
these
cases
and
that
exception
in
the
treatise
about?
what
are
they
thinking
of?
what
kinds
of
instances
do
they
think
come
under
50(a)
that
aren't
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
suppose
we
can
say
this:
that
when
a
lawyer
uses
50(a)
to
make
the
kind
of
motion
that
does
not
involve
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
but
rather,
in
fact,
could
be
made
without
50(a),
under
those
circumstances
he
doesn't
have
to
say
50(b).
how
would
that
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
work
fine,
because
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
lot
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
claims,
but
that's
another
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
case,
anyway,
is
a
case
--
judging
from
what
they
wrote,
i'm
back
to
where
i
started
with
the
mixed
questions
and
fact-based
questions
--
where
you
really
have
to
renew
your
motion,
and
reading
your
opinion
it
seems
to
me
it's
filled
with
determinations
of
fact.
they
were
reviewing
what
the
jury
did
and
could
have
found,
and
on
the
basis
of
what
they
could
have
found,
they
say
you're
not
entitled
to
--
or
you
are
entitled
to
qualified
immunity.
so
this
would
seem
like
a
hornbook
case
where
you
have
to
make
the
motion,
and
if
you
have
to
make
the
motion,
you
didn't,
and
if
you
didn't,
you
don't
go
back
and
review
the
facts
as
--
the
motion
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
as
they
were
before
the
trial.
end
of
matter.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
mean
they
went
on
the
jury's
resolution
of
the
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
that
reason,
they
can't
take
the
facts
as
they
were
in
your
motion
for
summary
judgment.
they
have
to
take
them
on
the
basis
of
--
they
can't
just
go
back
and
review
them
on
the
--
yes.
