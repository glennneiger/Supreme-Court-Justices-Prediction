justice

that
answer
is
not
addressing
justice
alito's
point,
which
he
said
a
rule
50
motion
is
not
jurisdictional.
you
are
in
essence
claiming
it
is.
you
are
saying
they
lacked
the
power,
but
justice
alito's
question
to
you
said
they
don't,
that
they've
misread
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
motion.
so
address
that
question:
why
is
it
jurisdictional
as
opposed
to
a
claim
processing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
claim
processing
rules
we
have
said
that,
unless
you
object,
the
court
doesn't
lack
power.
since
you
didn't
object
below
to
a
argument
that
rule
50(b)
precluded
consideration
by
the
court
of
appeals,
why
wasn't
that
argument
waived
before
the
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
just
--
just
finish:
because
if
ms.
jordan
had
reported
the
incident
that
she
was
required
to,
they
would
have
put
ms.
ortiz
in
segregation
automatically;
is
that
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
we
should
--
i
think
what
that
means
to
me
is
that
you
really
ignore
whether
it
was
raised
at
summary
judgment.
if
you
are
going
to
look
at
the
evidence
at
trial,
what
do
we
look
at,
at
trial,
to
see
that
the
claim
of
qualified
immunity
was
preserved?
because
it's
a
little
illogical
to
say
you're
reviewing
the
summary
judgment
record
when
you're
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
was
that
instruction?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
a
cite
to
the
record?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
--
could
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
--
could
you
articulate
for
me
the
line
that
you
see
between
assuming
all
of
the
facts
and
it's
not
enough
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
a
sufficiency
claim.
and
let's
break
out
the
two
claims:
one
against
ms.
jordan,
one
against
ms.
bright.
on
the
due
process
claim
against
ms.
bright
there
are
two
prongs
i
think
to
your
argument.
one
is
that
as
a
matter
of
law
under
sandin
putting
her
in
solitary
confinement
did
not
violate
any
--
any
constitutional
right.
and
then
there's
"she
didn't
retaliate"
part
of
your
claim.
the
two
seemed
mixed
up
to
me
below.
and
i
thought
in
reading
your
submissions
to
the
district
court
you
were
saying
that
if
she
retaliated
in
putting
her
in
segregated
confinement,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there
is
a
sandin
violation
or
not;
she
couldn't
do
the
retaliatory
act;
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
first
amendment.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
trying
to
separate
out
your--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--your
argument,
however.
what
is
your
--
what
is
your
position
on
this
question?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
is
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--is
that
the
--
that
is
what
the
chief
justice
asked
you
earlier.
why
is
that
such
a
horrible
thing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
--
i'm
not
sure
that
answers
the
question.
isn't
it
better
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
know
a
district
court's
opinion
on
every
issue
that's
going
to
come
up
on
appeal,
and
wouldn't
our
announcement
of
the
rule
--
that
whether
it's
an
issue
of
law
or
fact,
it
has
to
be
renewed
under
50(b),
so
everybody's
on
the
same
page
as
to
what's
going
to
be
heard
on
appeal
--
why
is
that
a
bad
rule?
why
would
that
be
a
bad
outcome
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
rule
you
want
us
to
adopt
to
answer
the
question
presented?
you
asked
us
to
take
cert
on
a
question
presented.
what
is
the
answer
you
want
us
to
give
on
the
question
presented?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
no
circumstances?
