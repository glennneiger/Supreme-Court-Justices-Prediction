chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-737,
ortiz
v.
jordan.
mr.
mills?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
so
quickly,
but
that
especially
i
take
it
--
i
take
it
as
a
concession
that
there's
a
difference
between
claims
for
qualified
immunity
based
on
evidence
and
claims
that
are
based
on
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand,
counsel,
how
your
argument
that
in
every
case
you
need
to
know
the
facts,
every
qualified
immunity
case
you
need
to
know
the
facts,
and
those
only
come
out
at
trial
--
is
consistent
with
our
recognizing
that
you
can
have
a
collateral
order
appeal
of
denial
of
summary
judgment.
in
other
words,
you
can
consider
qualified
immunity
without
knowing
how
the
facts
are
going
to
come
out
at
trial,
which
is
why
we
allow
you
to
have
an
appeal
before
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so
you
are
just
saying
your
case
on
qualified
immunity
isn't
like
that
case;
is
that
all?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
have
an
obligation
in
opposing
summary
judgment
to,
in
your
list
of
disputed
facts
or
facts
that
preclude
summary
judgment,
to
put
all
that
in.
and
why
didn't
you
put
the
point
you
are
raising
now
in
the
opposition
to
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know.
so
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but
--
but
you
may
prevail.
you
may
have
three
different
factual
disputes
that
the
other
side
is
saying
are
undisputed,
and
the
fact
that
you
prevail
on
one
doesn't
meant
that
you
didn't
have
an
obligation
to
put
in
your
opposition
the
others.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
mizer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
that
is
right,
and
i
find
that
in
the
context
where
that
already
matters,
whether
they
are
appealable
as
a
collateral
issue,
already
very
difficult
and
complicated
to
sort
out.
now,
what
you
want
us
to
do
is
take
that
difficulty
and
continue
it
on
in
terms
of
when
you
can
appeal
and
when
you
can't.
some
qualified
immunity
claims
are
purely
legal.
some
are
purely
factual.
some
are
in
the
middle.
wouldn't
it
be
easier
if
we
just
said:
here's
the
rule
from
now
on,
you've
got
to
renew
them
all
in
a
50(b)
motion
and
that
makes
it
a
lot
easier
for
the
trial
courts
and
the
appellate
courts
to
figure
out
when
they
have
to
--
when
they
can
consider
it
and
when
they
can't.
i
understand
your
argument
that
it
makes
a
difference.
i
think
it's
a
good
argument,
because
some
don't
depend
on
the
facts.
but
going
forward
it
just
creates
an
awful
lot
of
difficulty
that
we
don't
need
to
buy
into.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
had
the
caveat
that
except
for
the
issue
we
addressed
in
unitherm?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
mills,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
rule,
in
response
to
justice
sotomayor,
would
basically
require
anyone
who
has
an
assertion
of
qualified
immunity
to
take
their
collateral
appeal
or
interlocutory
appeal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
they
are
put
to
a
choice
whether
or
not
their
qualified
immunity
claim
rests
entirely
on
law
or
might
turn
out,
as
you
say
it
did
in
your
case,
to
have
some
factual
aspect?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
kind
of
a
tough
choice
to
put
them
to,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
they
have
to
take
the
immediate
appeal,
and
when
they
do
so,
they
lose
the
right
to
appeal
at
the
end?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
is
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
