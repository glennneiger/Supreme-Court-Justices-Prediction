justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
mr.
mills,
what
then
is
the
difference?
you
point
out,
quite
rightly,
summary
judgment
looks
to
what
evidence
there
was
and
the
question
for
the
court
is:
what
could
the
plaintiff
prove?
when
we
get
past
trial,
the
issue
becomes:
what
has
the
plaintiff
proved?
so
what
was
brought
out
at
trial?
what
was
the
record
at
trial
that
was
larger
than
the
record
at
summary
judgment?
because
if
there
was
no
--
no
new
fact
presentation,
no
more
ample
fact
presentation,
then
it
wouldn't
matter.
it
would
be
the
same
body
of
evidence,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it
--
power
--
jurisdiction
is
power,
power
to
proceed
in
a
case.
but
we
are
in
an
area
where
there
are
many,
many
cases
of
this
court
that
distinguish
the
rule
50(a),
50(b)
from
the
run-of-the-mine
claim
processing
rule
because
in
the
background
is
the
seventh
amendment
re-examination
clause.
that's
the
whole
reason
why
there
is
this
50(a)-50(b)
litany,
why
the
verdict
loser
must
repeat
the
50(a)
motion,
after
the
verdict.
so
i'm
surprised
that
you're
using
the
word
"power"
and
you're
not
referring
to
any
of
that
history
which
stems
from
a
constitutional
provision,
the
seventh
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
then
that
if
we
explain
to
the
fifth
circuit
--
to
the
sixth
circuit,
that
the
record
they
must
look
at
is
the
trial
record,
so
it's
different
from
the
summary
judgment
stage,
if
we
told
them
that
then
maybe
they
would
look
at
the
evidence
differently,
even
though
they
purported
to
look
at
the
trial
evidence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
you're
right,
then
there
has
to
be
a
remand
to
the
sixth
circuit
with
instructions
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
to
ask
the
district
court
whether
it
thought
the
evidence
was
sufficient?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
you
prevailed
on
the
summary
judgment
motion.
there
was
a
summary
judgment
motion,
right?
and
it
was
denied.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
--
we
know
that
the
district
judge
thought
that
at
that
point
there
was
a
case
to
be
presented
for
trial
based
on
the
plaintiff's
allegations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
mizer,
then
you
must
concede
that
this
opening
sentence
that
justice
kennedy
just
quoted
is
wrong.
courts
normally
don't
review
the
denial
of
summary
judgment
motion
after
trial
on
the
merits,
but
when
the
summary
judgment
denial
is
based
on
qualified
immunity,
there's
an
exception.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
fact,
you
did.
you
did
move
under
50(a).
this
whole
case
is
here
because
apparently
--
well,
what
reason
was
it
that
you
didn't
make
the
50(b)
motion?
you
told
the
court
under
50(a),
after
all
the
evidence
was
in
but
before
the
case
went
to
the
jury,
that
the
jury
would
not
have
a
legally
sufficient
evidentiary
basis
to
find
for
ms.
ortiz.
that
was
--
that
was
your
motion.
you
were
saying:
court,
there
was
no
legally
sufficient
evidentiary
basis.
evidentiary
basis.
that
was
the
motion
that
you
made,
recognizing
that
the
judgment,
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
sufficient
evidentiary
basis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
what
you
are
saying
is
you
didn't
even
need
to
make
the
50(a)
motion,
that
that
was
just
an
unnecessary
touching
base
with
rule
50(a)?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
explain
to
me
what
--
you
made
a
50(a)
motion.
why
did
you
--
was
there
a
reason
for
making
the
50(a)
motion
and
not
following
it
up
with
a
50(b)
motion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
very
clear
from
rule
50
that
50(a)
and
50(b)
go
together,
and
the
explanation,
as
i
indicated
when
petitioner's
counsel
was
speaking,
is
the
re-examination
clause
of
the
seventh
amendment.
so
i
think
every
first
year
procedure
student
learns
50(a),
50(b)
go
together,
and
there
is
an
historic
reason
why
you
must
back
up
a
50(a)
motion
with
a
50(b)
motion.
they're
not
--
they
all
--
they
all
ask
the
same
question.
the
rule
56,
the
rule
50,
50(b),
they
all
ask:
is
there
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
a
jury
finding,
whatever.
they
all
ask
that,
but
they
ask
--
ask
it
on
the
basis
of
a
different
record:
the
summary
judgment
record,
the
trial
record,
and
the
jury
verdict.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
of
any
case
holding
that
you
don't
have
to
couple
a
50(a)
motion
with
a
50(b)
motion
depending
upon
what's
in
your
50(a)
motion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
--
you
refer
to
sandin.
there
are
some
extra
things
about
the
confinement
here.
she
was
shackled,
she
was
ill,
and
nobody
attended
to
her.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
--
on
the
question
of
whether
this
treatment
was
punitive
rather
than
just
protective
custody.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
wouldn't
it
be
this,
the
segregated
confinement
in
this
case,
not
at
large?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
you
are
saying,
the
category
--
the
mixed
claims
--
as
justice
breyer
proposed,
if
it's
a
purely
legal
claim,
then
you're
right.
if
it's
a
mixed
claim,
then
you're
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
purpose
of
--
of
50(b)
--
justice
alito
brought
out
that
it's
not
simply
the
historical
background
of
the
seventh
amendment,
but
in
that
same
line
of
cases,
the
court
gave
a
practical
reason.
and
the
practical
reason
related
to
the
district
court,
that
if
the
motion
is
made
after
the
jury
comes
in,
the
district
judge
would
have
the
opportunity
to
exercise
her
discretion
to
grant
a
new
trial.
let's
take
--
is
it
ms.
bright
where
the
sixth
circuit
said
that,
well,
maybe
there
could
have
been
a
retaliation
claim,
but
the
plaintiff
didn't
make
it?
the
district
judge,
given
the
chance,
might
have
said:
i
would
exercise
my
discretion
to
allow
the
plaintiff
to
have
a
new
trial
on
this
retaliation
claim.
i
thought
it
was
before
the
court
and
it
was
a
good
claim.
the
sixth
circuit
thought
it
wasn't.
i
mean,
the
purpose
is
to
get
the
district
judge
into
the
picture
to
exercise
the
district
judge's
discretion
on
the
very
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
presents
a
procedural
question.
may
a
u.s.
court
of
appeals
review
after
trial
a
federal
district
court's
denial
of
a
pretrial
motion
for
summary
judgment?
the
question
arises
--
arises
in
the
context
of
a
prisoner's
civil
right
suit.
petitioner
michelle
ortiz,
a
former
inmate
at
--
in
ohio
prison
commenced
an
action
for
damages
against
two
prison
officers,
paula
jordan,
case
manager
at
ortiz's
living
unit,
and
rebecca
bright,
a
prison
investigator.
on
two
consecutive
nights,
ortiz
alleged
a
prison
guard
sexually
assaulted
her.
she
promptly
reported
the
first
assault,
ortiz
for
the
alleged,
but
officer
jordan
though
aware
of
the
risk
ortiz
faced
did
nothing
to
ward
off
the
second
assault.
ortiz
charged
that
bright
placed
her,
shackled
and
handcuffed
in
solitary
confinement
in
a
cell
without
adequate
heat,
clothing,
bedding,
or
blankets.
bright
did
saw
according
to
ortiz
in
retaliation
for
the
complaints
ortiz
made
about
the
prison
guards'
assaults.
jordan
and
bright's
conduct,
ortiz
urged
violated
her
right
to
reasonable
protection
from
violence
while
in
custody.
before
trial,
jordan
and
bright
moved
for
summary
judgment
based
on
their
defense
of
qualified
immunity.
that
defense
shields
public
officers
from
suit
if
their
conduct
did
not
violate
any
clearly
established
right.
denying
the
officers'
motion,
the
district
court
explain
that
the
force
of
their
qualified
immunity
defense
depended
upon
disputed
facts
within
the
province
of
a
jury
to
resolve.
the
case
proceeded
to
trial
and
the
jury
returned
sizable
verdicts
against
both
officers.
appealing
to
the
sixth
circuit,
jordan
and
bright
argued
that
their
pretrial
summary
judgment
motion
should
have
been
granted.
appellate
courts
ordinarily
do
not
reach
that
to
review
the
denial
of
a
pretrial
summary
judgment
motion
once
a
trial
has
taken
place.
the
sixth
circuit
so
acknowledged.
but
it
relied
on
what
it
believed
to
be
an
exception
to
that
rule
when
qualified
immunity
is
at
stake
holding
two-to-one
that
qualified
immunity
sheltered
jordan
and
bright
from
ortiz's
suit,
the
appeals
court
reversed
the
judgment,
entered
on
the
jury's
verdict.
we
now
reverse
the
sixth
circuit's
judgment.
there
is
no
qualified
immunity
exception
we
hold
to
the
rule
that
a
pretrial
summary
judgment
motion
cannot
be
appealed
after
a
case
has
been
fully
tried.
a
plea
of
qualified
immunity
of
course
does
not
vanish
what
a
district
court
defines
to
rule
on
the
plea
summarily.
but
at
the
trial,
the
defense
must
be
evaluated
in
light
of
the
character
and
quality
of
the
evidence
received
in
court.
the
challenge's
sufficiency
of
that
evidence,
a
defendant
can
move
post
verdict
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
jordan
and
bright
did
not
do
so,
nor
did
they
request
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
that
the
weight
of
the
evidence
favored
their
qualified
immunity
defense.
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
had
no
warrant
to
override
the
jury's
verdict
or
the
appraisal
of
the
evidence
made
by
the
judge
who
saw
and
heard
the
witnesses
and
thereby
gained
a
sense
of
the
case
no
transcription
of
the
record
can
impart.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
joined.
