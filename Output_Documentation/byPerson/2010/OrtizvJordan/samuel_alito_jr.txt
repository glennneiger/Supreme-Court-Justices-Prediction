justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
gets
to
what
troubles
me
about
this
case.
although
the
sixth
circuit
referred
to
summary
judgment
in
its
opinion,
it
seems
to
me
the
sixth
circuit
actually
reviewed
the
evidence
at
trial
and
determined
that
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
based
on
the
evidence
at
trial.
so
i
don't
know
why
this
case
actually
presents
the
question
on
which
cert
was
granted.
it
seems
to
me
it
presents
a
question
of
--
a
purely
factual
question
in
the
end,
whether
there
was
--
whether
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
was
appropriate.
and
you
never
raised
the
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
you
never
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
it,
the
argument
that
the
defendants'
ability
to
object
to
the
entry
of
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
was
waived
because
they
never
filed
the
rule
50(b)
motion.
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
we
were
to
hold
that
they
couldn't
review
the
denial
of
summary
judgment.
the
case
is
remanded
to
them
and
they
say:
okay,
well,
we
made
a
slip
of
the
pen
when
we
referred
to
summary
judgment
in
the
prior
decision.
we
really
were
saying
that
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
and,
although
there
wasn't
a
rule
50(b)
motion,
that
was
waived
because
it
wasn't
raised
on
appeal.
so
we
are
--
we
come
back
to
exactly
where
we
are
now.
all
we
have
done
is
to
correct
a
slip
of
the
--
what
was
arguably
a
slip
of
the
pen,
perhaps
motivated
by
their
belief
that
the
rule
50(b)
issue
is
jurisdictional.
but
it
really
is
not
under
our
cases
distinguishing
between
jurisdictional
questions
and
claims
processing
questions.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
mills,
i
got
you
started
on
this,
but
none
of
this
is
the
question
on
which
we
granted
review,
is
it?
we
didn't
grant
review
to
decide
whether
a
court
of
appeals
can
consider
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
where
there
isn't
a
50(b)
motion
and
no
argument
is
made
that
the
--
that
issue
was
waived
by
failing
to
make
the
motion.
we
didn't
grant
review
on
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
your
argument
is
that
where
the
district
court
denies
summary
judgment
on
a
qualified
immunity
issue
that
is
based
even
purely
on
an
issue
of
law,
there
can't
be
a
review
unless
that's
renewed
--
there
can't
be
appellate
review
unless
that
purely
legal
question
is
renewed
in
the
rule
50(b)
motion.
that's
your
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
if
the
facts
are
utterly
undisputed?
there
is
a
videotape
of
exactly
what
went
on.
nobody
has
the
slightest
disagreement
about
the
facts.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
right
was
clearly
established,
and
the
district
court
rejects
that
at
summary
judgment.
what
benefit
--
what
is
the
point
of
saying
that
the
defendants
have
to
raise
that
same
issue
again
in
the
rule
50(b)
motion?
it's
utterly
a
--
a
pointless
exercise.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
--
determining
what
is
a
mixed
question
is
notoriously
difficult.
what
about
the
--
the
situation
where
the
--
the
ruling
is,
assuming
certain
facts
to
be
true,
the
--
the
right
was
not
clearly
established?
now,
is
the
fact
that
certain
facts
are
assumed
to
be
true
enough
to
make
that
a
mixed
question?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
mizer,
is
it
your
understanding
that
--
that
unitherm
was
based
on
seventh
amendment
considerations,
or
was
it
based
on
prior
decisions
that
in
turn
were
grounded
on
considerations
of
fairness
to
the
verdict-winner,
namely
the
opportunity
when
a
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
is
made
after
the
verdict
to
move
for
dismissal
without
prejudice
or
move
for
a
new
trial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
answer
is
it's
a
pointless
gotcha
rule.
isn't
that
the
answer?
it's
a
pure
issue
of
law,
and
the
district
court
has
already
said,
i
ruled
on
this
on
summary
judgment;
don't
bother
me
with
this
again,
and
we're
going
to
say:
well,
you
still
have
to
raise
it
in
a
50(b)
motion.
that
--
there's
no
point.
we
might
as
well
say
that
the
lawyer
has
to
stand
on
his
head
when
the
motion
is
made
or
jump
up
and
down
three
times.
