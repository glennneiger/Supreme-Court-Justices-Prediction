justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
the
argument
you
are
making.
are
you
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
texas
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
"as
construed"?
i
mean,
it's
their
statute.
i
mean,
you
say
somewhere
in
your
brief
that
--
that
they
gave
it
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
interpretation.
it's
up
to
them
how
they
want
to
interpret
it.
we
don't
--
we
don't
reinterpret
state
statutes
because
the
state
supreme
court
interpreted
it
strangely.
it
seems
to
me
you
are
either
challenging
the
statute
or
--
or
you
don't
belong
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
just
so
long
as
we
are
clear
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
couldn't
a
habeas
court
say
the
conviction
was
invalid
because
of
the
failure
to
turn
over
this
--
this
dna
evidence,
which
was
relevant
to
the
defense
and
which
was
unconstitutionally
denied?
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
basis
for
setting
aside
the
conviction?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
tell
you
what
the
problem
is.
the
problem
is
rooker-feldman.
that's
why
all
of
these
things
don't
make
much
sense.
i
mean,
it
wouldn't
happen
because
you
had
the
opportunity
to
raise
that
in
the
state
court,
and
now
you
are
retrying
what
the
state
court
did
decide.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
but
that
would
be
an
obstacle
to
habeas.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
in
habeas
you
would
be
seeking
to
set
aside
the
state
court
judgment.
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
why
it's
so
unrealistic
to
handle
it
that
way,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
--
to
--
to
win
a
brady
claim
in
habeas,
wouldn't
you
--
you
have
to
show
not
just
that
it
was
withheld,
but
that
it
was,
indeed,
exculpatory,
and
could
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
doesn't
have
to
make
that
showing
here.
i
mean,
that's
what
he
says
distinguishes
this
case
from
habeas.
in
habeas
you
would
have
to
show
that
indeed
it
would
justify
a
different
outcome
in
the
trial,
whereas
here,
he
says
i
don't
have
to
show
that,
i
just
want
the
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
he
is
going
to
do
with
it.
but
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
say
that
i
need
to
show
that
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
--
to
the
relief
i'm
asking
for.
whereas
he
would
have
to
say
that
in
habeas.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
--
maybe
we
need
--
i
mean,
we've
never
had
a
case
like
this
and
it's
conceivable
to
--
to
me
that
we
have
to
expand
what
we
said
in
heck
and
prieser.
i'm
not
sure,
however,
that
what
we
ought
to
say
is
what
you
propose:
that
the
test
is
whether
it
could
be
brought
in
habeas.
you
say
it
could
be
brought
in
habeas
by
claiming
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
but
you
would
lose
that
--
that
habeas.
you
can
bring
anything
in
habeas.
i
mean,
you
can
file
a
habeas
petition.
i
assume
you
mean
you
could
possibly
win
in
habeas.
you
couldn't
win
in
habeas
with
this
claim
because
you
couldn't
show
that
it
would
have
affected
the
outcome.
isn't
that
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
where
its
only
purpose
is
to
demonstrate
--
is
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
the
invalidity
of
the
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
chose
to
construe
it
the
way
it
construed
it.
you
--
you
can't
attack
the
way
--
the
way
the
state
supreme
court
construed
its
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
attacking
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
