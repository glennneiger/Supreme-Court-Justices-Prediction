justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
assume
that
this
whole
case
focuses
on
paragraph
33
of
your
complaint;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
"but"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
--
look,
33
says
the
district
attorney
has
violated
my
rights
under
the
law
by
refusing
to
give
me
the
dna
evidence,
so
make
them
do
it.
that's
how
i
read
33.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
not
the
relief.
that's
your
complaint.
you
explain
why
you
think
it
violates
federal
law
for
them
not
to
do
it.
you
ask
them
to
do
it.
is
there
anything
else
to
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
why
you
are
entitled
to
the
relief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
else
in
the
case
that
you
want?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
want
the
dna
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
didn't
agree
with
what
the
chief
justice
just
said,
did
you?
i
noticed
you
were
nodding
your
head.
he
says--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
would
you
agree
with
that?
i
guess
there
is
nothing
left
of
this
case.
but
i
--
but
do
you
agree
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
think
that
sounds
like
--
i
would
interpret
his
complaint
is
what
he
wants
is
the
dna.
he
thinks
it's
going
to
be
exculpatory.
he
doesn't
know
that
till
he
gets
it.
so
look
at
dotson.
dotson
says
that
you
go
into
habeas
if
winning
--
i.e.,
getting
the
dna
--
would
necessarily
spell
speedier
release.
end
of
the
matter.
i'm
reading
to
you
from
justice
scalia's
concurrence
where
he
quotes
my
majority
with
great
praise.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
not
whether
you
--
what
he's
worried
about
--
he
can
speak
for
himself
but
as
i
read
the
concurrence,
he
was
worried
that
if
you
win
and
take
1983
away,
all
kinds
of
things
will
be
stuffed
into
habeas,
which
don't
belong
there.
and
that
may
be
a
true
and
correct
criticism,
but
whether
it
is
or
not,
he
has
agreed,
indeed
nine
members
or
seven
members
or
something
of
the
court
agreed,
that
the
test
i
read
to
you
is
the
test.
and
now,
if
that's
the
test,
getting
the
dna
does
not
necessarily
spell
speedier
release;
it
all
depends
on
what
the
--
on
what
that
dna
shows.
so
why
isn't
that
end
of
the
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
a
totally
different
area,
because
in
dotson
when
--
i
think
what
we
did
do
was
go
through
every
of
these
--
every
one
of
the
prior
cases,
and
they
did
involve
for
the
most
part
the
attack
as
you
say
on
prison
procedure.
and
those
cases
where
the
attack
on
the
proceeding
would
have
restored
good
time
credits,
there
it
was
shortening
the
--
the
length
of
confinement.
in
those
cases
where
there
was
a
general
attack
on
procedures,
but
the
procedure
would
simply
be
carried
on
better
later,
like
parole,
there
wasn't.
you
suddenly
focused
me
on
a
whole
new
set
of
areas.
where
in
the
case
law
is
this
different
rule
that
the
rule
we
just
said
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
if
it's
in
the
case?
that's
basically
what
you
are
arguing;
what
should
i
read
to
show
that
you
were
right
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
particular--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
see
your
point.
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
try
to
understand
this.
and
we
have
the
dotson
point,
and
you
said
there
are
two
other
cases,
prieser
and
heck.
so
what
dotson
says
about
prieser
is
that
the
plaintiff
there
wanted
the
shortening
of
his
term
of
confinement.
he
wanted
good
time
credits
to
be
restored.
and
as
we
read
it
then,
the
shortening
of
the
term
of
confinement
is
what
made
it
proper
in
habeas.
but
we
added
that
if
it
hadn't
been
for
that,
if
it
hadn't
attacked
the
duration
of
the
physical
confinement,
it
wouldn't
be
habeas;
it
would
be
1983.
in
heck,
the
same
thing.
they
were
establishing
the
basis
for
a
damages
claim
that
necessarily
demonstrated
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction.
where
that
was
so,
there
would
be
habeas.
where
that
was
not
so,
even
if
successful,
it
would
not
demonstrate
the
invalidity
of
any
outstanding
criminal
judgment.
the
action
should
be
allowed
to
proceed
in
1983.
so
as
we
read
those
two
cases,
they
stood
for
the
exact
principle
i
described.
now
you
want,
perfectly
fairly,
to
say,
but
we
didn't
read
them
correctly,
or
we
shouldn't
have
read
them
as
exclusively
to
say
what
i've
just
read.
fine.
what
is
it,
in
your
opinion,
precisely,
that
we
should
have
the
principle
of
distinguishing
the
one
1983
from
habeas
corpus
if
we
were
to
abandon
as
an
exclusive
test
what
we
said
and
i
just
read
you
in
those
three
cases:
dotson,
prieser,
heck?
what's
your
contrary
approach?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
--
in
heck
itself,
you
said
a
1983
action,
where
it
is,
even
if
successful,
will
not
demonstrate
the
invalidity
of
any
outstanding
criminal
judgment.
a
1983
action
should
be
allowed
to
proceed.
now,
i
take
it
what
you
are
suggesting
is
we
say
that
sentence
is
wrong
or
overstated;
that
there
is
another
circumstance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
though
it
will
not
demonstrate
that
the
judgment
was
wrong,
it
still
should
not
be
allowed
in
1983
if
it
is,
quote,
"related
to"
the
criminal
case
itself.
something
like
that
is
what
you
are
proposing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
say
what
it
is,
then.
say
what
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
part
of
a
process
where
you
hope
to
demonstrate.
can
you
bring
in
habeas?
a
motion,
let's
say,
to
examine
police
files?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
this
isn't
brady.
what
you
say
is,
i
have
a
right
under
criminal
law
here
that
everybody
has
that
i
can
go
back
and
take
depositions
of
the
--
you
have
a
reason
for
doing
it.
you
want
to
take
their
depositions
because
you
want
to
show
that
something
wasn't
followed.
can
you
do
that
in
habeas?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
a
federal
law
--
is
there
a
federal
statute
that
--
you
can't
say
yet
whether
it's
invalid.
we
don't
know.
what
we
want
is
to
get
the
information
that
will
help
us
make
that
decision.
we
think
there
is
a
law
that
entitles
us
to
that
right.
can
you
bring
that
in
habeas
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
library.
i
want
to
use
the
prison
library,
same
example.
i
want
to
use
the
prison
library
9:00
to
3:00,
because
that's
when
i
work
on
my
efforts
to
upset
my
conviction.
now
--
i
mean,
it's
the
same
as
justice
kagan--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--provided.
what
about
that?
