chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-9000,
skinner
v.
switzer.
mr.
owen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
disconnects
the
irreparable
harm
alleged
with
respect
to
a
stay
and
your
claim
that
you
now
say
--
you
say
now
that
your
claim
is
not
going
to
necessarily
affect
the
--
the
sentence.
the
irreparable
harm,
if
i
remember,
is
quite
obviously
the
execution.
but
it's
--
there
is
no
irreparable
harm
from
your
failure
to
get
access
to
the
dna
evidence,
unless
its
linked
to
the
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
osborne
expressly
considered
both
procedural
due
process
and
substantive
due
process.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
critical
formulation
in
heck
necessarily
implies
--
is
a
little
difficult.
i
mean,
the
adverb
points
one
way
and
the
verb
points
the
other.
and
how
--
"necessarily
implies"
strikes
me
as
a
little
less
conclusive
than
you
seem
to
think.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
--
you
read
"necessarily
implies"
to
mean
"conclusively
establishes",
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
asking
for
an
expansion
of
heck
from
"necessarily
implies"--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
"demonstrates"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
1983
claim
would
not
establish
innocence
but
would
still
be
covered
by
heck.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
necessarily
implies
or
conclusively
establishes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
say
in
--
the
rest
of
paragraph
33
is
that
you
want
the
biological
evidence
because
by
refusing
to
turn
it
over,
he
prevented
you
from
gaining
access
to
exculpatory
evidence
that
could
demonstrate
he
is
not
guilty
of
capital
murder,
which
is
usually
what
we
--
what
habeas
corpus
is
for:
to
show
you
are
not
guilty
of
what
you
are
in
prison
for.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand.
but
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
--
different
cases
where
people
are
seeking
the
dna
evidence
might
come
out
differently
under
heck.
in
other
words,
if
it's
the
type
of
dna
evidence
that
could
conclusively
establish
he's
innocent.
i
mean,
there
are
types
like
that.
it's
somebody
else's,
you
know,
dna
and
that's
what's
necessary
for
the
conviction.
and
there's
other
types
of
dna
evidence
that
doesn't.
i
mean,
it
just
happens
to
be
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
it
turns
out
that
it's
not
him
that
was
in
the
room.
he
was
somewhere
else,
and
it
might
or
might
not
mean
he
was
innocent.
in
the
former
case,
you
say
that
has
to
go
under
habeas,
but
in
the
latter
it
doesn't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
owen.
mr.
coleman?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
says
exculpatory
evidence
that
could
demonstrate
that
he
is
not
guilty.
there
is
a
lot
of
exculpatory
evidence
that
might
imply,
necessarily
imply
guilt,
but
there
is
a
lot
of
exculpatory
evidence
that
simply
is
helpful
and
doesn't
mean
it
will
demonstrate.
he
says
it
could.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--justice
ginsburg's
question
i
think
is
an
important
one.
are
you
going
to
argue
that
you
fit
within
--
this
case
fits
within
"necessarily
implies"
or
is
there
another
formulation
that
you
think
we
should
have?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
just--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
owen,
take
five
minutes
--
or
you
have
five
minutes.
