justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
what's
the
rule
that
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
that
you
are
challenging?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
how
that's
different
than
what
alaska
did
in
the
osborne
case
that
we
upheld
their
procedure?
i
thought
that
was
one
of
the
elements
of
the
alaska
rule
as
well.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
if
you
had
an
opportunity
to
ask
for
it
and
gave
it
up,
that
you
lost.
so
how
are
we
getting
to
that
here?
how
are
you
going
to
get
past
osborne
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--are
you
--
one
of
the
criticisms
by
your
adversary
of
your
proposal
to
bring
these
actions
via
1983
is
a
prospect
that
the
courts
will
be
used
to
collaterally
attack
convictions
by
all
sorts
of
due
process
allegations
concerning
discovery
disputes.
could
you
address
that
point,
and
why
either
you
agree
with
them
that
that's
going
to
happen,
or
if
you
don't,
why
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
you
do
with
the
brady
violation?
is
that
a
"necessarily
implies"
or
is
that
more
akin
to
your
claim?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
substantive
right
in
brady
was
to
have
that
material
at
trial,
so
that
is
the
substantive
constitutional
right.
here
the
substantive
right
that's
been
identified
in
osborne
is
the
liberty
interest
created
by
state
law.
and
that
only
happens
after
the
conviction.
so
it's
not
quite
the
same.
it's
not
comparable.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
coleman,
the
habeas
statute
says,
2254(a),
a
federal
court
can
entertain
a
habeas
petition
only
on
the
ground
that
the
petitioner
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
federal
law.
tell
me
how
he
can
write
a
complaint
that
says
the
violation,
due
process
violation
of
access
to
dna,
means
that
this
defendant
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
federal
law
as
opposed
to
having
had
a
statutory
right
improperly
denied
him.
tell
me
how
does
he
write
that
complaint
to
get
into
habeas?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
is
he
in
custody
in
--
in
violation
of
federal
law?
because
of
the
improper--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
that's
not
his
claim
here.
his
claim
here
is
that
he
was
denied
dna
evidence
improperly
under
state
law
in
violation
of
federal
--
the
federal
constitution.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
means
foia
requests,
where
your
only
purpose
is
to
seek
out
the
police
files
because
you
are
hoping,
just
like
you
are
in
dna
testing,
that
those
files
will
show
exculpatory
material.
then
foia
requests
have
to
be
brought
in
habeas
as
well.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
owen,
i
know
i
am
pushing
you,
but
i
really
would
like
a
clear
statement
of
what
the
procedural
due
process
violation
which
you
are
claiming
occurred
here
is?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--then
let
me
follow
this
through.
you
are
not
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
article
64
on
its
face,
right?
or
are
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
saying
--
and
that's
--
this
is
where
i
have
difficulty.
that
by
failing
to
acknowledge
petitioner's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
that
that
was
the
court's
error?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
that
was
a
good
enough
excuse
to
excuse
the
fact
that
he
didn't
do
dna
--
dna
testing
at
the
time
of
trial?
because
that's
what
the
statute
says.
you
can't
get
it
if
it
was
present
at
the
time
and
--
meaning
if
that
actual
test
that
you
are
seeking
was
available
at
the
time
of
trial,
or
you
don't
prove
that
you
couldn't
have
done
it
for
a
good
reason.
so
what
is
it
exactly
that
the
court
did
in
applying
this
that
was
unconstitutional?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
wait
a
minute.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
gives
the
conditions
under
which
a
petitioner
can
seek
dna
evidence,
and
it
said
you
didn't
meet
those
conditions.
i'm
still
trying
to
figure
out
what
you
are
arguing
was
the
procedural
due
process
violation
in
their
application
of
those
items.
so
are
you
challenging
it
facially
or
are
you
challenging
it
as
applied,
but
as
applied
how?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
what
do
you
think--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
is
it
about
what
they
said
it
means
that
is
unconstitutional?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
even
sure
what
that
argument
ties
to,
because
i
thought
what
the
court
said
was,
this
dna
testing
was
available
then.
you
could
have
gotten
it.
strategically
your
trial
attorney
chose
not
to,
and
so
that
disqualifies
you
from
seeking
it
now.
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
the
date
of
the
statute's
passage,
whether
it
makes
any
difference,
because
--
because
why?
