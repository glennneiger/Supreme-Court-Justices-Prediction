mr.
owen,
as
i
read
--
as
i
read
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
owen,
could
i
take
you
back
to
rooker-feldman
with
that
as
the
premise?
you
said
that
what
you
are
attacking
is
the
judgment.
i
read
your
complaint
as
having
an
important
strand
where
you
were
not
attacking
the
judicial
judgment,
but
instead
were
attacking
actions
of
the
prosecutor's
office,
independent
of
any
judgment
of
the
state
courts.
are
you
abandoning
that
part
of
your
complaint,
or
are
you
continuing
to
maintain
it?
because
certainly,
if
you
talk
about
the
judgment
alone,
it
at
least
gets
you
into
rooker-feldman
territory,
whereas
if
you
talk
about
the
prosecutor,
it
does
not.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
coleman,
if
you
could
answer
justice
breyer's
question,
because
there
are
two
phrases,
necessarily
imply
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction
and
necessarily
spell
speedier
release;
and
either
you
think
that
your
case
fits
one
of
those
or
both
of
those
standards,
or
you
are
asking
us
to
abandon
that
standard.
justice
elena
kagan
but
how
could
this
be
brought
in
habeas?
if
mr.
skinner
wants
this
evidence
and
--
and
we
say
you
file
a
habeas
petition,
what
would
that
habeas
petition
look
like?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
take
the
case,
mr.
coleman
--
i
think
there
was
one
recently
in
the
fifth
circuit
where
a
prisoner
asked
for
appellate
slip
opinions.
and
the
prisoner
said
i
want
these
slip
opinions
so
i
can
write
a
better
habeas
petition.
did
that
also
have
to
be
bought
--
brought
as
part
of
a
habeas
case
or
can
that
be
brought
in
1983?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
he
said
he
didn't
have
enough
access
to
slip
opinions
and
he
needed
more
slip
opinions
in
order
to
be
able
to
obtain
a
quicker
release
from
prison
via
habeas.
justice
elena
kagan
no
what?
justice
elena
kagan
why
is
that
different?
justice
elena
kagan
why
--
why
is
that
different?
both
the
--
the
--
the
prisoner
is
seeking
a
tool
that
he
hopes
will
lead
to
a
quicker
release,
although
it
has
no
certainty
at
all
of
doing
so.
justice
elena
kagan
so,
mr.
owen,
if
i
understand
you
correctly
in
how
this
understanding
of
the
claim
relates
to
the
rooker-feldman
doctrine,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
statute
as
construed
was
unconstitutional?
justice
elena
kagan
and
that
falls
outside
the
bounds
of
the
rooker-feldman
doctrine?
justice
elena
kagan
whereas,
if
you
were
saying
that
the
statute,
that
the
application
of
the
statute
in
this
particular
case
was
wrongful,
that
would
not
fall
outside
of
the
rooker-feldman
doctrine;
is
that
right?
