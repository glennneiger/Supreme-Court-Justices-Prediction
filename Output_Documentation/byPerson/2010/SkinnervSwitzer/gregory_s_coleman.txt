mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
good
morning,
chief
justice
roberts,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
decide
this
case
the
court
only
needs
to
make
two
stops.
first
is
paragraph
33
of
mr.
skinner's
complaint.
that
complaint,
that
statement
of
his
complaint
clearly
alleges
against
ms.
skinner
--
miss
switzer
herself
that
she
has
withheld
and
the
word
he
uses,
exculpatory
evidence,
and
violates
his
due
process
rights
through
that.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
there
are
two
points
in
response
to
that,
chief
justice
roberts,
and
the
first
is
that
this
is
the
classic
statement
of
a
brady
claim.
when
you
file
a
brady
claim,
you
don't
know
exactly
what
it
is
and
whether
it
will
definitely
be
exculpatory
or
not,
you
have
learned
information
that
makes
you
think
that
it
would
be--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i'm
not
saying
that
legally
that
there
isn't
some
difference
to
be
made
from
osborne.
osborne
rejected
the
substantive
claim
that
you
can
bring
a
brady
claim.
what
i'm
saying
is
the
language
of
the
text
of
his
complaint
is
a
brady
allegation,
and
at
page
19,
footnote
6
of
his
own
brief,
he
acknowledges
that
brady
claims
have
to
be
brought
in
habeas.
and
is
left
simply
arguing
that
one,
that
i
can
describe
to
the
court
a
different
theory
of
my
complaint,
or
that
regardless
of
how
i
describe
the
complaint,
i
can
break
out
the
discovery
aspects
of
that
complaint
and
do
it
under
1983
and
not
in
habeas.
and
part
of
the
problem
with
that--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--yes.
but
that
claim
--
that
showing
is
to
be
made,
if
at
all,
in
habeas;
and
he
has
the
opportunity--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--there
is
some
ambiguity.
i'm
not
sure
i
fully
understand
what
you
mean
by
here.
he
has
alleged
that
that's
what
he
is
going
to
prove.
what
he
--
what
he
says
in
his
brief
and
what
he
stands
before
the
court
today
and
says
i'm
going
to
show
are
--
are
different
things.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
disagree;
with
respect
to
the
relief
that
he
is
ultimately
seeking,
the
question
is,
if
you
are
saying
that
the
1983
suit
is
simply
a
retrying
of
the
article
64
proceeding,
than
i
--
i
would
have
to
concede
that
article
64
does
not
require
the
same
showing
as
habeas
claims.
but
part
of
the--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
as
the
court
and
your
concurring
opinion
in
osborne
made
clear,
that
--
that
exculpatory
is
really
defined
as
demonstrating
that
you
were
innocent
and
that
it's
material.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
justice
scalia
--
justice
scalia
also
makes
the
point
at
the
end
of
his
dotson
concurrence
that
the
question
--
the
real
question
is
whether
you
could
make
out
this
type
of
claim
or
this
--
make
out
this
type
of
proceeding
in
habeas.
ultimately
prieser
and
heck--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--because
i
disagree
that
the
two
words
"necessarily
implies"
are
in
fact
sort
of
the
end
of
the
battle
and
the
end
of
the
test.
as
justice
ginsburg
noted
earlier
in
the
argument,
the
court
has
dealt
with
these
issues
in
a
--
in
a
variety
of
cases,
most
of
them
being
prison
disciplinary
or
parole-type
proceedings.
and
in
those
cases
the
court
is
trying
to
define
the
outer
bounds,
ultimately
of
what
we're
going
to
say
prieser/heck
required
to
be
brought
in
habeas,
and
what
may
be
brought.
a
couple
of
boundaries
on
those
rules
at
first;
prieser
and
heck
make--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
think
that
that's
true.
i
think
that
what
the
court
has
always
recognized,
an
article
64
proceeding
is
a
motion
in
the
criminal
case.
if
you
look
at
the
docket
number
on
the
motion,
it
is
a
motion
in
the
criminal
case.
what
necessarily
implies
has
always
been
used
for
is
defining
the
outer
bounds
of
the
rule
in
terms
of
prison
disciplinary
proceedings,
parole,
other
things
outside
the
criminal
case
itself.
this
is
an
attack
on
the
--
the
criminal
proceeding.
this
is
a
post-conviction
motion
in
the
criminal
case
itself.
it's
like
a
rule
6--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--it's
not
in
the
court
of
conviction,
it's
under
the
docket
number
of
the
case.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
think
prieser
and
heck
both
stand
for
the
fundamental
proposition
that
congress
set
up
habeas
as
a
means
of
allowing
collateral
attacks.
nowhere
else
does
congress
specifically
permit
collateral
attacks
on
criminal
proceedings.
then
prieser
and
heck
say,
what
we
allow
from
that
is,
those
things
that
may
be
brought
in
habeas
should
be
brought
in
habeas
because
the
congressional
intent
behind
the
habeas
statute
is
that
we
expect
the
safeguards
that
congress
has
put
in
place
to
respect
comity
and
federalism
interests
as
well
as
other
interests.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well,
the
habeas
petition
--
we
know
it
can
be
brought
in
habeas
because
one,
he
has
already
brought
it.
he
brought
a
habeas
petition
based
on
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
that
is
--
as
a
matter
of
argument
indistinguishable
from
the
no-fault
arguments
that
he
is
making
here,
the
complaints
against
the
no-fault
aspect
of
the
article
64
proceeding.
he
can
bring
that.
many
courts
--
this
court
has
never
fully
said
that
you
can,
but
many
courts
do
allow
actual
innocence-type
claims
to
go
forward,
and
so
he
can
bring
an
ineffective
assistance
habeas,
he
can
do
an
actual
innocence
habeas,
and
he
can
do
discovery
as
part
of
that
habeas;
and
when
he
does
that,
when
he
does
that
congress
says,
you
must
respect
those
criminal
proceedings.
you
must
show
deference,
you
must
require
exhaustion.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well
he
--
he's
stood
before
the
court
today
and
explained
how
he
would
write
that
complaint,
and
as
i
mentioned
to
justice
kagan--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--because
he
believed
that
he
received
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
that
he
can
make--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that's
correct
and
the
--
the
last
part
of
my
answer
to
justice
kagan
i
think
is
the
answer
to
your
question,
and
that
is
if
you
make
out
either
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
or
an
actual
innocence
type
claim,
the
congressional
intent
that
you
observe
and
show
deference
and
exhaustion
and
all
those
things,
require
that
to
be
given
to
every
step
of
the
process.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
but
the
moment
you
file
the
complaint
through
discovery,
through
every
substantive
aspect
of
that,
what
mr.
skinner
wants
to
do
is
say,
i
want
to
engage
in
artful
pleading,
and
so
i'm
going
to
make
attacks;
today
they
are
on
dna
evidence,
tomorrow
they
may
be
a
brady
claim,
next
week
it
may
be
a
claim
against
procedures
used
in
state
habeas;
but
as
long
as
i
don't
expressly
ask
that
my
custody
be
undone,
i
--
i
expect
those
claims
to
be
allowed
to
go
forward
in
1983
without
any
of
the
protections
of
habeas,
and
then
--
then
if
it
looks
after
a
year
that
they
are
going
pretty
well,
then
i
will
flip
it
over
to
habeas
and
go
forward
with
my
habeas.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
think
the
approach
is
if
these
things
may
be
properly
made
the
subject
of
a
habeas
corpus
claim,
then
congressional
intent
and
the
habeas
statute
require
that
it
be
brought
in
habeas.
i
think
that--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
disagree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
think
that
we
are
saying
that
the
court
is
wrong.
what
i
think
i'm
saying
is
that
"necessarily
implies"
is
not
a
magic
words
test
that
is
the
sort
of
complete
and
ultimate
statement
of
the
prieser-heck
rule,
but
rather--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
think
that
that
is
correct,
in
the
sense
that
if
you
look
at
dotson,
which
was
--
involved
a
specific
claim
for
process
--
which
is
not
what
they
are
asking
for.
they
are
asking
for
actual
relief,
not
process.
but
you
look
at
those
types
of
cases.
whether
it's
heck,
it's
a
civil
case
that
went
about
attacking
it,
these
cases
on
the
periphery
of
what
goes
in
and
out
of
heck,
the
"necessary
implied"
language,
i
think,
is
a
good
descriptor
for
what
is
at
--
was
at
the
periphery.
but
when
you
attack
the
core
of
the
criminal
proceeding
itself,
what
his
rule
is
simply
--
is
an
attempt
to
take
the
two
words
or
the
phrase
from
dotson
and
turn
it
back
on
itself
and
say
--
says
that
under
heck,
i
can
attack
motions
in
the
criminal
proceedings
themselves,
in
the
state
habeas
itself,
as
long
as
i
stop
short
of
asking
for
that
ultimate
that
we
read.
so
heck
said
the
case
is
about
avoiding
article
pleading,
but
now
what
he
wants
to
turn
into
is,
is
a
rule
that
encourages
artful
pleading
and--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
as
you
noted
in
your
concurrence
in
dotson,
the
question
is
not
whether
you
win,
but
whether
you
could.
and
the
question
is,
if
it's
properly
the
subject
of
habeas,
then
congress
has
demanded
that
all
of
the
safeguards
and
protections
for
habeas
be
in
place.
and
that--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
you
are
angling
for
there.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
i
think
that
there
is
also
a
misunderstanding
about
what
article
64
is.
skinner
treats
article
64
as
simply:
i
asked
for
evidence,
and
i
get
evidence.
and
you
denied
me
the
dna.
what
article
64
actually
is,
it's
a
motion,
as
i
mentioned,
filed
in
the
criminal
case
itself,
that
says:
judge,
i
want
a
ruling
that
if
this
additional
dna
evidence
were
known
at
the
time
of
trial,
then
i
probably
would
not
have
been
convicted.
and
the
process
for
obtaining
that
ruling
is
to
make
an
initial
threshold
showing
that
suggests
the
materiality
of
the
dna
evidence.
if
you
get
over
that
threshold,
then
you
move
on
to
testing,
and
you
get
a
hearing
and
an
ultimate
determination.
but
there
are
really
only
two
results
in
article
64.
one
is
a
ruling
that
you
probably
would
not
have
been
convicted.
or
two,
i
reject
your
request
for
a
ruling
that
you
probably
would
not
have
been
convicted.
and
that's
what
he
got.
it
is
a
motion
that
goes
to
the
core
of
the
conviction
itself.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--what
about
--
where
it--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
ultimately,
the
only
reason
it
can
be
brought
is
to
demonstrate
the
invalidity
of--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--you
could
bring
a
claim
in
habeas,
alleging,
for
instance,
brady.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
if
you
are
alleging
some
underlying
constitutional
invalidity
of
your
conviction
and
you
need
to--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--the
discovery
provisions
of
habeas
allow
you
to
seek
that
as
part
of
your
habeas
claim,
and
when
you
do
that,
all
the
safeguards
and
protections
of
habeas
apply.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
think
foia
is
different.
i
--
foia--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--you
can
ask
for
it.
i
can
ask
for
it.
chief
justice
roberts
can
ask
for
it.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
don't
know
the
specifics
of
that
claim,
but
--
but
i
would
tend
to
think
if
--
if
a
person
generally
had
access
to
slip
opinions,
then--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
--
i
would
say
no.
but--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that
that
would
not
have
to
be
brought
as
a
habeas.
but,
again,
this
is
different.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
excuse
me?
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
think
because
there
is
no
rights
specific
to
him
--
for
instance,
if
i
seek
dna
evidence,
it's
because
i
want
to
attack
my
conviction.
and
there
is
no
other
reason
to
do
it.
if
i
want
slip
opinions,
it
may
be
that
i
want
to
read
them,
it
may
be
for
--
and
the
general
public
has
access
to
slip
opinions
the
same
way
the
general
public--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that's
a
condition--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that's
a
condition
--
that's
just
a
prison
condition.
the
court
has
always
said
that
those
types
of
things
can
be
brought
in
1983.
but
--
but
what
we
are
talking
about
here
really
is
ultimately
if
you
are
convicted
in
one
county
but
you
are
serving
time
in
a
different
part
of
the
state,
you
bring
your
habeas
claim
and
then
at
the
same
time
you
bring
a
1983
suit,
you
ask
for
discovery
and
say
i
don't
want
--
and
this
could
be
dna,
it
could
be
some
other
brady
materials,
it
could
be
attacked.
you
say
i
want
to
litigate
the
first
half
of
my
claim
out
here
without
any
of
the
protections
of
habeas,
and
then
if
it
turns
out,
well,
i'm
going
to
just
move
them
over
and
use
them
in
my
habeas,
that
--
without
any
of
the
protections
--
that
is
what
prieser
and
heck
were
ultimately
trying
to
stop.
heck
said
we
--
the
only
time
we
really
allow
these
types
of
collateral
attacks
--
and
--
and
heck
cites
rooker
for
this
very
proposition.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
there
--
there
is
a
way.
when
--
when
the
court
said
in
osborne
you
should
use
these
state
statutes
and
you
may
--
you
might
have
a
procedural
due
process,
the
court
was
not
saying
we
are
going
to
create
out
of
hole
cloth
an
entirely
new
category
of
procedural
due
process.
you
do
it
like
you
do
any
other
procedural
due
process.
if
you
go
into
the
system
and
you
--
you
file
--
and
again
litigation
is
different
from
an
administrative
procedure,
which
is
what
dotson
was
about.
you
are
in
litigation
and
you
are
in
court.
and
if
somebody
says,
well,
there
is
this
prong
that
you
can't
meet
and
you
thing
it
violates
due
process,
you
have
an
obligation
to
raise
it
then,
and
then
you
have
an
opportunity,
if
the
court
rules
against
you,
to
file
a
cert
petition.
and
if
you
don't
do
that,
what
we
do
know
is
from
this
very
limited
area,
the
one
thing
that
you
can't
do
is
file
a
federal
1983
lawsuit
saying,
i
think
that
what
the
state
court
did
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
and,
so,
skinner
is
asking
you
to
create
a
1983
lawsuit
that
is
always
rooker-feldman
barred
and
always
preclusion
barred,
because
you
are
asking
the
court
to
declare
that
the
state
courts
violated
your
--
the
constitutional
rights
in
the
way
they
went
about
it.
and
--
and
so
he's
asking
you
to
create
a
category
of
1983
suits
that
runs
exactly
contrary
to
rooker-feldman
and
exactly
contrary
to
what
heck
said
is
this
overriding
interest
in
ensuring
that
these
types
of
collateral
attacks
are
brought,
if
at
all,
in
habeas
and
not
through
generalized
1983
lawsuits
that
don't
provide
any
of
the
protections
that
congress
has
insisted
by
statute
be
applied
in
these
types
of
suits.
mr.

well,
first,
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
ever
acknowledged
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action
for
discovery
separate
and
apart
from
the
merits
of
what
you
are
seeking
to
do.
the
merits
of
what
he
is
seeking
to
do
is
to
attack
his
custody.
that
is
something
that
can
and
should
be
brought
in
habeas,
and
the
court
should
not,
for
many
reasons,
create
a
cause
of
action
that
--
whose
sole
purpose
is
to
run
counter
to
rooker-feldman
and
whose
sole
purpose
is
to
avoid
the
protections
of
habeas.
again,
this
is
not
an
expansion
of
habeas.
it's
simply
a
recognition
that
he
has
a
claim
that
he
can
bring
in
habeas,
it
--
it
probably
is
an
a
loser
and
we
think
it
certainly
would
be
a
loser,
but
the
question
is,
can
he
bring
it
and
if
he
can,
it
should
be
subject
to
these
types
of
things.
and
at
the
end
when
you
recognize
what
he
is
trying
to
do,
this
is
fundamentally
a
question
or
a
--
he
is
seeking
to
invalidate
his
conviction
and
that
it
comfortably
fits
within
the
policy
choices
that
the
court
has
made
all--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--the
way.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
we
think
given
the
nature
of
the
article
64
proceeding,
which
is
itself
an
attack
on
the
conviction,
it
is
a
request
that
the
court
declare
that
the
conviction
is
probably
invalid,
that
because
that
is
what
he
is
attacking,
he
is
saying
the
result
that
is--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that
--
that
we
do
fit
within
the
64
ruling
is
an
attack,
but
that
within
the
broader
context,
if
the
court
feels
a
need
to
rule
on
the
cases
in
criminal
proceedings,
then
--
then
it
should
recognize
it
should
be
brought
in
habeas.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
very,
very
briefly?
if
the
--
if
the
only
claim
you
brought,
you
say,
i'm
--
i
can
never
meet
article
64,
because
it
says
only
applies
to
convictions
after
january
1,
2000.
i
--
i
can't
meet
that,
i
think
it's
unconstitutional.
you
file
a
1983
lawsuit,
and
you
say
i
think
that
provision
is
unconstitutional.
that
is
really
dotson
saying,
rule
that
that
prong
is
unconstitutional
but
let
me
go
back
and
have
process.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
that's
dotson,
not
this
case.
