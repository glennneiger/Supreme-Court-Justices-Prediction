mr.
robert
c.
owen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
and
the
only
question
litigated
to
decision
in
the
courts
below
is
whether
a
prisoner's
claim
that
seeks
only
access
to
evidence
for
dna
testing
may
be
brought
in
federal
court
under
the
civil
rights
act.
the
fifth
circuit
summarily
answered
that
question
"no"
in
hearings
with
longstanding
view
that
any
federal
claim
that
might
conceivably
set
the
stage
for
a
subsequent
collateral
attack,
however
removed
in
time,
must
itself
be
brought
via
habeas.
that
rule
so
clearly
cannot
be
squared
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
especially
since
wilkinson
v.
dotson,
that
the
court
should
reverse
and
remand.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
describing
the
contours
of
the
heck
rule.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
justice
ginsburg,
the
reason
that
we
argue
our
case
does
not
touch
the
conviction
is
that
the
relief
that
we
are
seeking,
access
to
the
evidence
for
testing,
if
we
won,
if
we
win
in
district
court
and
we
get
that
access,
it
does
not
necessarily
imply
--
which
is
the
language
this
court
used
in
heck
and
repeated
in
dotson
--
that
the
conviction
is
lawfully
invalid.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
that's
true,
your
honor.
we
--
we
don't
see
that
as
a
distinction
that
compels
the
conclusion
that
dotson
isn't
the
model
to
follow,
because
in
--
in
our
view,
what
dotson
said
--
again,
the
prisoners,
as
justice
ginsburg
says,
were
before
the
court
seeking
a
declaration
about
parole
procedures
that
ohio
planned
to
use
in
their
cases.
those
parole
procedures
had
been
adopted
after
those
prisoners
were
sent
to
prison,
and
they
complained
that
was
an
ex
post
facto
violation.
and
ohio
argued,
both
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
in
this
court,
that
the
fact
that
these
prisoners
expected
at
some
point
to
come
back
to
court
armed
with
a
judgment
in
their
favor
and
seek
a
reduction
in
their
sentences
was
enough
to
conclude
that
the
case
should
be
within
the
core
of
habeas.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
it's
an
irony
--
i
--
i
accept
the
court's
point
that
that
--
that
that
seems
unusual,
but
i
think
that
the
reason
that
the
court's
cases,
at
least
as
to
the
relief
that
we're
seeking
and
not
the
stay
that
the
court
entered
in
order
to
hear
this
case
and
decide
the
question,
that
the
relief
we
are
seeking
does
not
necessarily
imply
the
legal
and
validity--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
--
if
i
--
if
i
was
understood
to
say
that,
then
i
--
let
me
clarify.
i
think
that
our
success
--
when
the
--
when
the
court
applies
the
stay
standard,
it
asks
the
question:
what
is
the
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits?
success
on
the
merits,
for
purposes
of
our
lawsuit,
means
getting
access
to
the
evidence.
that's
--
that's
what
it
means.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
i
think
once
we
had
demonstrated
that
we
were
likely
to
prevail
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
i
think
the
court
was
within,
you
know,
appropriate
judgment
to
--
to
make
sure
that
the
case
didn't
become
moot
by
mr.
skinner's
execution.
because
i
do
think
that
the
demonstration
that
we
had
to
make
was
not
about
whether
his
ultimate
--
whether,
ultimately,
he
might
get
relief
from
his
conviction,
but
whether
we
have
a
chance
of
prevailing
on
this
civil
rights
claim
that
asks
for
access
to
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
your
honor,
i
--
i
guess
i
don't
have
a
better
answer
than
the
one
i
gave
justice
kennedy,
and
that
is:
i
think
the
stay
standard
doesn't
have
to
link
those
two
things.
i
think
that
if
the
court
finds
that
mr.
skinner
is
going
to
die
before
he
can
litigate
his
claim
and
it
finds
he
has
a
reasonable
chance
of
prevailing
on
that
claim,
that
is
sufficient
to
--
to
enter
the
stay.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
absolutely.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
no.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
no,
it's
not
subject
to
those,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
that
the
--
the
reason
that
--
i
think
the
reason
the
rooker-feldman
issue
has
arisen
at
this
juncture
in
the
case
is
that
the
pleadings
in
the
district
court
were
not
permitted
to
--
because
of
the
sort
of
--
the
fact
that
we
were
dismissed
at
a
very
early
stage
in
the
process,
essentially
on
the
threshold
of
the
case,
there
was
no
opportunity
to
develop
in
full
what
the
legal
arguments
are
for
both
sides.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
no,
i
think,
your
honor,
that's
--
i
--
i
don't
agree
about
the
court's
reading
of
rooker-feldman
if
you
think
that
--
if
the
court
believes
that
that
would
preclude
it.
and
the
reason
is
this:
in
the
feldman
case
itself,
the
--
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
who
were
unsuccessful
lawyers
who
are,
what,
a
law
school
graduate
and
an
attorney
who
was
barred
outside
the
district
of
columbia,
and
were
trying
to
get
a
waiver
for
a
requirement
for
taking
the
bar
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
they
filed
a
number
of
claims
against
the
application
of
that
rule
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
in
their
circumstances.
but
--
and
this
court
said
those
claims
can't
proceed.
those
claims
challenge
the
application
of
the
law
to
the
facts.
but
this
court
went
on
to
say
in
feldman
--
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
says
they
have
also
raised
other
claims,
and
those
claims
are
that
this
rule,
as
authoritatively
construed
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
is
--
is
unconstitutional.
it
violates
the
constitution.
and
the
court
said
in
feldman,
those
claims
may
proceed.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
your
honor,
the
rule
that
we
are
challenging
is
that
when
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
construed
the
faults
provision
of
the
texas
dna
testing
statute
in
our
case,
it
created
a
wholesale
classification
that
said
everybody
who
falls
into
mr.
skinner's
situation
who
did
not
ask
for
testing
at
trial
is
forever
foreclosed
from
getting
testing.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
in
texas
we
have
--
the
difference,
i
think,
your
honor,
is
the
difference
between
a
substantive
due
process
claim,
as
i
understand
it,
and
a
procedural
due
process
claim.
that
in
osborne
the
claim
that
was
being
made
was
that
the
state
was
denying
a
federal
right
in
denying
access
on
that
basis.
our
argument
is
that
the
texas
--
the
texas
statute
was
enacted
to
grant,
essentially,
protection
to
a
class
of
inmates
who
were
--
inmates
who
were
wrongfully
convicted
and
can
prove
that
with
dna
evidence.
and
then
--
and
then
interprets
that
statute
in
a
way
that
needlessly
chops
a
bunch
of
those
inmates
out.
and
that
that
is
arbitrary,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
it
doesn't
have
reference
to
the
specific
facts
of
the
case,
the
likelihood
of
innocence,
the
reasons
for
not
doing
the
testing,
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
but
the
reason,
your
honor,
as
i
--
as
i
read
osborne,
that
it
did
not
reach
a
decision
on
the
procedure,
or
it
didn't
--
that
it
rejected
osborne's
procedural
due
process
claim
was
because
he
hadn't
tried
at
state
court.
i
mean,
that
was
the
premise
of
osborne,
was
he
was
--
i
think
the
court's
language
in
osborne
was
if
he
hasn't
tried
those
procedures,
he
is
in
no
position
to
complain
about
them
in
federal
court,
whereas
we
did
try
the
procedures
and
it's
precisely
that
that
is
the
basis
for
our
claim
in
federal
court.
if
i--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
don't
agree
with
them,
your
honor,
and
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all
is
that
experience
doesn't
suggest
that.
the
rule
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
adopt
for
the
whole
nation
has
been
the
rule
for
some
time
in
six
different
circuits
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
in
those
circuits
there
have
been
a
very
large
number
of
prisoners
going
into
court
under
section
1983
and
trying
to
leverage
discovery
under
the
circumstances
that
are
suggested
by
respondent's
brief.
so
that's
the
practical
reason.
as
a
legal
--
as
a
legal
reason,
i
think
that
our
claim
turns
on
the
existence
of
the
liberty
interest
in
the
state
statute
for
dna
testing
that
texas
has
created,
and
that
there
is
no
statute
in
texas
for
other
kinds
of
general
discovery;
for
example,
access
to
the
prosecutor's
file,
police
reports,
or
other
kinds
of
documents.
that's
not
--
there
is
no
legal
hook
for
that.
our
legal
hook
is
the
existence
of
that
dna
testing
statute
and
the
existence
under
state
law
of
opportunities
to
bring
claims
of
actual
innocence
after
the
evidence
is
tested.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
if
that
word
were
in
isolation,
your
honor,
there
might
be
more
uncertainty
about
what
"implies"
means.
but
if
the
court
looks
at
the
cases
--
looks
at
prieser,
looks
at
heck,
looks
at
edwards,
looks
at
nelson,
looks
at
hill
--
what
you'll
see
is
the
word
"necessarily"
is
in
all
those
cases.
and,
in
fact,
in
hill
--
or
maybe
it
was
nelson;
one
of
the
two
florida
cases
--
the
court
italicizes
it
twice
in
the
same
paragraph.
and--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--not
that
strong,
your
honor.
but
to
finish,
the
other
answer
i
was
going
to
say
is
that
in
other
cases
--
i
was
going
to
say,
"necessarily"
is
everywhere.
"necessarily"
is
in
all
the
cases.
but
the
court
also
--
"implies"
is
not
in
all
the
cases.
in
dotson,
for
example,
the
court
uses
the
word
"demonstrates".
"necessarily
demonstrates"
that
the
judgment
underlying
the
custody
is
invalid.
so
i
think
that
there's--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--no,
i
think
we
are
--
i
think--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
that
--
i
think
edwards
is
an
example
of
that,
your
honor,
where
--
in
edwards,
the
defendant,
the
prisoner,
was
suing
in
federal
court,
alleging
that,
in
his
words,
"the
procedures
that
were
used
to
deny
him.
"
--i
think
it
was
deny
him
parole
or
convict
him
of
disciplinary
offenses,
but
the
procedures
that
had
resulted
in
the
disadvantage
he
was
complaining
about
were
unconstitutional.
but
when
you
looked
at
his
complaint,
what
he
said
was
this
--
the
reason
those
procedures
are
unconstitutional
is
because
the
decisionmaker
was
personally
biased
against
me,
which
is
less
a
complaint
about
the
procedures
and
more
a
complaint
about
the
merits
of
that
adjudication.
and
if
you
believe
it,
if
you
credit
that,
and
say,
okay,
we
are
--
fine,
that's
what
happened,
the
adjudication
was
biased
against
you,
that
necessarily
implies
the
invalidity
of
the
judgment
reached
by
that
procedure.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
necessarily
--
with
bias,
perhaps
that
would
be
conclusively
established,
because
i
think
there
is
no
harmlessness
test
there.
but
i
think
that
at
least
in
an
adjudication,
there
wouldn't
be.
but
i
think
"necessarily
implies"
is
all
that
the
court
needs
to
continue
embracing
in
order
to
find
that--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--for
a
couple
of
reasons,
your
honor,
it
is
not
akin
to
our
claim.
first
is
this.
brady
is
a
trial
right.
and
i
don't
mean
necessarily
that
it
arises
at
trial,
because
sometimes
it
arises
at
--
a
discovery
that
makes
a
brady
claim
colorable
arises
after
trial.
but
brady
is
a
right
to
have
certain
evidence
when
you
go
to
trial
so
that
you
can
use
it
in
an
attempt
to
get
the
jury
to
find
you
not
guilty.
and
therefore,
if
that
right
is
violated,
if
you
don't
get
that
evidence
and
it
is
discovered
later
that
you
were
denied
this
stuff
that
you
needed
to
have
a
fair
trial,
that
implies
the
invalidity
of
the
trial
judgment,
the
judgment
that
results
in
the
custody.
in
our
case,
the
judgment
that
we
are
challenging,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
denying
us
dna
testing,
which
does
not
in
the
same
way
demonstrate
or
necessarily
imply
that
the
custody
judgment
in
our
case
is
legally
invalid--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
we
are
in
the
territory
of
talking
about
the
judgment.
i
think
for
the
reasons
i've
described
earlier
that
that
does
not
lead
inexorably
to
a
rooker-feldman
bar.
but
i
think
that
the
nature
of
our
claim,
which
follows
from
osborne,
what
we
understood
the
court
to
be
recognizing
in
osborne,
or
acknowledging
in
osborne,
is
that
the
state's
administration
of
its
dna
testing
scheme
is
where
a
due
process
violation
might
theoretically
arise,
depending
on
how
it's
administered.
so
i
think--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--as
interpreted
in
our
case,
or
as
construed,
i
think
is
the
right
--
is
the
better
word.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think,
your
honor,
we
are
challenging
the
statute.
and
i
think
once
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
says,
here
is
what
the
default
provision
means,
that
is
the
same
thing,
for
the
purposes
of
this
court's
review,
as
if
the
legislature
had
written
that
in.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
yes,
sir.
that's
what
we
are
challenging.
i
certainly
agree
if
we
were
saying
they
got
it
wrong
on
their
own
terms,
that
would
be
a
rooker-feldman
bar,
because
we
couldn't
bring
that
claim.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
there's
been
a
lot
--
yes,
but
--
i
mean,
i
think
there's
been
a
lot
of--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
about
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
particularly
those
paragraphs.
i
think
that
is
maybe
missing
the
larger
point,
which
is
this:
as
we
said
earlier,
i
think
that
the
federal
rules
permit
complaints
to
be
notice
of
pleading.
they
permit
amendment.
they
permit
development
of
the
issues.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
that's
the
relief
that
we
are
asking
for,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
there
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
because
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
dna--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--all
right.
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
no.
we're
not
asking
--
no.
i
mean,
i
think--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--that's
correct.
we
don't
--
we
are
not
asking
this
court,
the
federal
district
court,
to
release
mr.
skinner
from
custody.
we
are
not
asking
them
to
accelerate
the
release
date
on
his
sentence,
for
which
there
is
none.
we
are
not
asking
them
to
modify
the
status
of
his
custody.
all
of
those
things
which
are
at
the
core
of
habeas
corpus,
as
this
court
has
interpreted
that
phrase,
none
of
those
are
requested
by
us.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
ordinarily,
your
honor,
if
that
--
if
we
knew
today
that
this
evidence
in
fact
was
exculpatory,
if
they
had
already
done
the
testing
and
they
mailed
us
a
report
that
says
it's
excluded
your
guy,
then
we
wouldn't
file
a
1983
action.
we
would
seek
clemency
or
we
would
file
a
state
habeas
petition.
we
would
do
something
where
the
court
would
have
the
power
to
protect--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--no.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
"necessarily
implies",
as
the
court
interpreted
that
phrase
in
dotson,
means
somewhere
down
the
road
you
may
come
back
to
court
and
you
may
attempt
to
undo
your
custody,
and
that's
not
enough
to
put
this
case
into
habeas.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
when
we
are
seeking
access
to
evidence
which
has
never
been
tested
for
testing,
that
could
be
brought
under
1983.
i
think
if
the
evidence
has
been
tested
and
test
results
exist
and
are
known
and
are
exculpatory,
that's
a
different
case
and
that's
probably
habeas.
because
then
it's
the
fact
that
the
results
are
known
and
we
know
they
are
exculpatory.
that
does
necessarily
imply
that
there's
something
about
the
judgment
that
could
be
undone.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
the
whole
--
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
the
whole
purpose
for
seeking
this
evidence
and
pursuing
this
lawsuit
is
so
that
mr.
skinner
can
have
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
pursue
the
liberty
interest
he
has
under
state
law
in
trying
to
secure
release
based
on
innocence.
that
is
correct.
but
i
don't
think
that
leads
inexorably
to
the
idea
that
this
lawsuit,
which
is--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
since
our
allegation
is
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
decision
denying
us
dna
testing,
which
is
not
the
judgment
that
results
in
mr.
skinner's
custody,
is
the
problem.
that's
the
bad,
invalid
judgment
from
our
legal
theory.
that
could
not
have
been
brought
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
because
i
think
that
the
relief
that
a
federal
habeas
court
would
have
available
to
itself
would
be
limited
to
release,
to
accelerating
release
or
changing
custody
status.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
power
in
the
federal
habeas
court
under
that
statute
to
say,
even
though
this
will
not
affect
the
judgment
as
to
which
you
are
in
custody,
i'm
going
to
act
on
this
way
in
order
for
this
person
to
do
that
or
the
other
thing.
i
think
that
it
wouldn't
be
available
in
habeas,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
your
honor,
this
court
has
never
said,
as
--
i
know
the
court's
aware
of
this;
i
want
to
make
sure
i'm
clear
on
that
--
this
court
has
never
said
that
it
would
be
a
constitutional
basis
for
habeas
relief
if
you
could
demonstrate
that,
factually,
you
were
not
guilty.
so
that
is
the
claim
that
would
have
to
be
brought
in
such
a
federal
habeas.
it
is
not
presently
available
because
this
court
has
never
held
that.
and
i
think,
given
the
constraints
of
the
federal
habeas
statute
and
the
requirement
of
clearly
established
federal
law
from
this
court
before
a
prisoner
could
get
relief,
that's
a
necessary
prerequisite
for
us
seeking
that
relief.
and
i'm
sorry.
i
hope
that
is
responsive,
your
honor.
the
problem,
i
think,
with
just
going
to
federal
court
and
saying,
give
us
discovery,
i
think
it's
the
same
problem
as
described
earlier
with
the
brady
framework.
if
we
knew
today--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think
to
the
extent,
your
honor,
that
the
question
goes
to
the
opportunity
that
we
had
to
raise
this
issue
in
the
state
court,
that's
a
preclusion
issue,
and
there
may
be
preclusion
issues
back
in
the
district
court.
we
may
have
a
dog
fight
over
whether
or
not
this
claim
should
have
been
raised
in
the
state
court.
but
that's
not
the
rooker-feldman
question,
as
i
understand
it.
i
think
the
rooker-feldman
question
is:
what
are
we
asking
the
federal
court
to
review?
we
were
asking
the
federal
court
to
review
the
criminal
court
of
appeals'
authoritative
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
that's
right.
habeas
would
be
our
only
route--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
that
it's
unrealistic.
i
mean,
i
think
that
over
time
the
courts
who
are
wrestling
with
this
issue
in
the
wake
of
osborne
will
identify
what
aspects
of
a
state's
statute
and
construction
of
such
statutes
violate
due
process
or
don't.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
that's
a
much
simpler
answer,
your
honor,
i
will
adopt
that
answer.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
that's
not
--
no,
your
honor,
i
think,
again,
that's
where
we
started
and
i'm
not
trying
to
bring
us
back
full
circle,
but
i
think
that
our
understanding
of
rooker-feldman
is
that
that
is
not
one
of
the
things
that
the
rooker-feldman
doctrine
prohibits.
and
of
course,
this
court
has
emphasized
in
recent
years,
in
the
exxon
case
and
elsewhere,
that
lower
courts
have
been
reading
rooker-feldman
too
broadly.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?
mr.
robert
c.
owen
your
honor,
our
--
our
claim
is
that
in
its
construction
of
the
statute
in
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
construed
the
statute
to
completely
foreclose
any
prisoner
who
could
have
sought
dna
testing
prior
to
trial
but
did
not
from
seeking
testing
under
the
post
conviction
statute.
that
is--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--that
speaks
too
broadly.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
your
honor,
this
--
this
came
up
as
we
were
preparing
for
our
presentation,
and
i
think
there's
--
there's
--
here's
what
i
would
like
to
say.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
article
64
--
that
there's
no
way
to
interpret
article
64,
that
the
court
could
have
chosen
to
--
to
construe
the
statute
that
would
always
be
unconstitutional
in
every
case.
that's
what--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
no,
your
honor.
our
claim--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
not
the
specific
question
to
whether
in
our
case
they
didn't
consider
our
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
arguments.
it's
that
it
made
no
provision
for
any
exception
to
its
rule.
in
other
words,
that
it
interpreted
this
as
a
blanket
prescription
on
seeking
testing
for
anybody
who
didn't
seek
it
prior
to
trial.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
once
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
construed
the
statute,
that's
what
the
statute
means
and
we
are
challenging
that.
if
that's
what
the
courts--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--and
that's
what
your
honor
described
as
facial.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
that
it
is
not
--
that
it
is
not
admit
of
any
exception
and
it
doesn't
have
any
references
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
the
reasoning
the
testing
might
not
have
been
sought
in
a
particular
case
or
the
fact,
particularly
in
our
case,
mr.
skinner
at
the
time
of
his
trial
this
--
the
post-conviction
dna
testing
statute
was
still
six
years
in
the
future.
so
to
the
extent
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
portrayed
mr.
skinner
as
making
a
choice,
that's
not
accurate,
because
he
didn't
make
the
choice.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
--
i
have
always
felt
it
was
intuitively,
especially
unfair
to
accuse
him
of
laying
behind
a
log
when
there
was
no
log
to
lie
behind.
but
that
is
not
our
point
in
responding
to
your
question,
your
honor.
our
point
is
simply
that
we
think
the
exception
that
they
crafted
in
construing
the
statute
or
the
statute
as
construed
sweeps
too
broadly.
the
exception
sweeps
too
broadly.
now,
the
court
may
not
necessarily,
we
may
not
prevail
on
that
eventually.
we
are
going
to
litigate
that
and
i
think
that
we
will
fight
that
out
in
the
district
court.
but
the
question--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--yes.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
the
comment
that
was
made
during
respondent's
arguments
about
--
he
says
we
are
challenging,
in
his
words,
the
way
the
state
court
went
about
applying
the
law
to
mr.
skinner,
that's
not
what
we
were
challenging.
we
are
challenging
the
statute
as
construed.
