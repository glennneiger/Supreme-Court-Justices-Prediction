justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
about
--
wilkinson
was
parole,
parole
eligibility,
so
it
didn't
touch
the
conviction
or
the
sentence,
where
this
one
does.
so
the
cases
are
distinguishable
on
that
basis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
understand
that
argument,
but
there
is
the
distinction
of
the
type
of
case
of
where
the
--
the
one,
conviction
and
sentence
were
never
going
to
be
questioned,
only
parole
eligibility,
where
here,
the
discovery
that
you
seek
in
1983
is
not
a
destination.
the
destination
is
to
further
litigation
that
may
or
may
not
arise.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
owen,
you
are
putting
your
case
into
our
decisions
about
the
line
between
1983
and
habeas.
but
if
nobody
--
if
you
didn't
know
anything
about
that
and
you
looked
at
what
was
presented
here
in
the
civil
case,
it
seems
as
though
you
are
splitting
your
claim;
that
is,
you
want
discovery,
and
if
the
discovery
is
favorable,
then
you
ask
for
relief
from
the
conviction.
so
it's
quite
unlike
i'm
complaining
about
prison
conditions.
here,
the
whole
purpose
of
your
seeking
this
discovery
is
so
that
you
will
be
able,
if
it
turns
out
to
be
in
your
favor,
to
apply
for
habeas.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
have
sought
habeas,
is
it
1983,
the
exclusive
relief,
or
could
you
have
sought
habeas
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
are
--
you
are
asking
for
a
modification
of
the
wilkinson-dotson
formula,
because
the
formula
is,
i
think,
quite
clear.
it
says,
"would
necessarily
demonstrate
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction
or
the
sentence.
"
wouldn't
necessarily
demonstrate.
and
the
petitioner
is
telling
us
it
may
not
demonstrate
it
at
all.
it
may
demonstrate
that
my
client
was,
in
fact,
guilty.
so
it
wouldn't
necessarily
demonstrate
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction.
and
i
think
that
--
to
get
--
to
say
that
you
should
prevail,
you
would
have
to
say:
court,
you
were
wrong
in
using
that
formula,
because
here
we
have
a
petitioner
who
says,
i'm
not
claiming
that
what
i'm
seeking
would
demonstrate
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are
asking
for
something
in
addition.
you
say:
court,
don't
just
look
at
the
words
in
wilkinson
v.
dotson.
this
is
a
different
case,
as
i
suggested
originally.
this
does
not
involve
parole.
the
ultimate
destination
in
this
case
is
the
conviction
and
sentence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
then,
can
you
give
us
your
best
modified
statement
of
wilkinson
against
dotson?
i
think
you
were
telling
us
that
that
formula
fit
that
type
of
case,
would
necessarily
demonstrate
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction.
it's
given
here
that
this
evidence
would
not
necessarily
demonstrate
the
invalidity
of
the
conviction,
nonetheless,
you
say
it
falls
on
the
habeas
side
of
the
line.
that
does
require
you
to
ask
for
a
modification
of
the
wilkinson
v.
dotson
formula,
and
i
--
and
if
you
could
say
what
that
would
be,
and
what
that
precise
modification
would
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
resolve
in
this
case
a
question
the
court
last
opened
two
terms
ago
in
district
attorney's
office
v.
osborne
when
a
convicted
state
prisoner
seeks
dna
testing
of
crime-scene
evidence,
what
remedial
route
should
he
follow?
may
he
assert
the
claim
in
a
civil
rights
action
on
the
42
u.s.c,
section
1983
or
is
his
sole
recourse
in
federal
court
a
habeas
corpus
petition
under
28
u.s.c
2254
which
entails
restrictions
not
applicable
in
1983
actions.
in
1995,
a
texas
jury
convicted
petitioner
henry
skinner
and
sentenced
him
to
death
for
murdering
his
girlfriend
and
her
two
sons.
throughout,
skinner
has
maintained
that
a
potent
alcohol
and
drug
mix,
he
ingested
on
the
day
of
the
murders,
disabled
him
from
committing
the
crimes.
he
identified
as
the
likely
perpetrator
his
girlfriend's
uncle,
an
ex-convict
with
a
history
of
physical
and
sexual
abuse.
prior
to
skinner's
trial,
the
state
dna
tested
some
of
the
crime-scene
evidence
but
left
many
items
untested.
skinner
wants
the
state
to
test
the
untested
items.
he
pursued
informal
efforts
to
that
and
in
the
decade
following
his
conviction
to
no
avail.
in
2001,
texas
enacted
a
law
allowing
prisoners
to
gain
postconviction
dna
testing
in
limited
circumstances.
invoking
the
texas
statute,
skinner
twice
moved
in
state
court
for
dna
testing
of
the
untested
crime-scene
evidence.
when
those
efforts
failed,
skinner
filed
the
instant
federal
action
for
injunctive
relief
under
section
1983,
naming
as
defendant
respondent
lynn
switzer,
the
district
attorney
whose
office
is
custodian
of
the
evidence
skinner
wants
to
have
dna
tested.
skinner
centrally
urged
that
texas'
postconviction
dna
statute
"as
construed"
by
texas
courts,
denied
him
procedural
due
process.
under
fifth
circuit
precedent,
habeas
corpus,
not
1983
is
the
remedial
avenue,
prisoners
seeking
dna
testing
must
pursue.
the
district
court
therefore,
dismissed
skinner's
suit,
and
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
we
stayed
skinner's
execution,
granted
certiorari,
and
now
reversed.
this
court's
2005
opinion
in
wilkinson
v.
dotson,
comprehensively
surveyed
a
prior
decisions
on
the
respective
provinces
of
1983
civil
right
actions
and
2254
federal
habeas
petitions.
habeas
is
the
exclusive
remedy
we
reaffirmed
for
the
prisoner
who
seeks
"immediate
or
speedier
release"
from
confinement.
but
where
the
prisoner's
claim
would
not
"necessarily
spell
speedier
release,"
suit
may
be
brought
under
1983.
adhering
to
dotson,
we
hold
today
that
a
postconviction
claim
for
dna
testing
is
properly
pursued
in
a
1983
action.
success
in
the
suit
gains
for
the
prisoner
only
access
to
the
dna
evidence,
which
may
prove
exculpatory,
inculpatory
or
inconclusive.
in
no
event
will
a
judgment
that
simply
orders
dna
test
"necessarily
imply
the
unlawfulness
of
the
state's
custody."
district
attorney's
switzer
argued
that
although
skinner's
immediate
plea
is
simply
for
dna
testing,
his
ultimate
aim
is
to
use
the
test
results
as
a
platform
to
attack
his
conviction.
but
switzer
has
found
no
case,
nor
have
we,
in
which
this
court
has
recognized
habeas
as
the
sole
remedy,
or
even
an
available
one
where
the
relief
sought
would
not
immediately
terminate,
or
limit
the
level
of
custody,
or
accelerate
the
date
of
release.
we
express
no
opinion
on
the
ultimate
disposition
of
skinner's
federal
action.
we
know
however,
that
the
court's
decision
in
osborne
severely
limits
the
scope
of
the
federal
action
a
state
prisoner
may
bring
for
dna
testing.
osborne
rejected
the
extension
of
substantive
due
process
to
this
area,
and
left
slim
room
for
the
prisoner
to
show
that
the
governing
stat
--
state
law
denies
him
procedural
due
process.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
kennedy
and
justice
alito
joined.
