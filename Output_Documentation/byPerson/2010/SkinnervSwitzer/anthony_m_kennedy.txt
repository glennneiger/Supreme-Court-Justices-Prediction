anthony
m.
kennedy
it
does
seem
odd,
though
--
and
i
don't
want
to
jump
into
your
argument
too
much,
because
you
have
got
planned
out
what
you
want
to
tell
us
--
it
does
seem
odd
that
if
your
suit
for
dna
testing
is
not
attack
--
an
attack
on
the
sentence,
that
you
asked
for
a
stay.
i
mean,
if
it's
not
an
attack
on
the
sentence,
why
shouldn't
that
factor
into
our
decision
not
to
grant
a
stay
or
to
grant
a
stay?
it's
--
it's
--
it's
an
irony
in
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
don't
grant
a
stay
in
order
to
decide
a
question.
we
grant
a
stay
because
of
the
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits.
and
that
goes
to
the
sentence.
and
now
you
are
telling
us
that
your
attack
doesn't
go
on
the
sentence.
i
don't
see
why
we
don't
just
lift
the
stay,
under
your
own
view
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
that's
all
it
means,
we
shouldn't
have
granted
a
stay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
except
that
at
page
18
of
the
yellow
brief,
where
you
did
have
time
to
explain
your
doctrine,
you
say
a
federal
constitutional
issue
arose
only
because
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
decision
regarding
the
state
law
issue
turned
out
to
be
so
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
as
to
denying
mr.
skinner's
federal
due
process
rights
--
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
but
i
think--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought
that's
rooker-feldman
to
a
tee.
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
a
correct
formulation
of
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
to
say
what
we
are
seeking
is
a
determination
that
the
state
court's
judgment,
the
state
court's
decisions,
state
court's
order
was
a
violation
of
due
process?
if
you
say
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
that's
rooker.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
filed
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
conviction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
--
well,
that
doesn't
quite
give
us
the
added
formulation
that
some
of
the
questions
suggest
we
need,
if
we
were
going
to
adhere
to
dotson
and
still
rule
for
you.
there
has
to
be
some
slightly
different
qualification.
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
it
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
was
going
to
ask
if
you
have
a
few
moments
to
address
the
rooker
argument.
what
--
what
is
your
response
to
petitioner's
counsel's
explanation
of
why
there
is
no
rooker
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
if
i
could
have
just
one
minute
--
then
if
you
do
not
file
an
article
--
in
a
state
court
at
all
and
you
just
go
to
1983,
you
are
back
under
heck
and
you
haven't
given
us
a
qualification
that
works
under
heck.
