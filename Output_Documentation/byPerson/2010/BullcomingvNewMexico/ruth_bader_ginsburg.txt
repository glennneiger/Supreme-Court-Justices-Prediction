mr.
fisher,
when
you
say
"in
the
presence",
do
you
--
do
you
mean
it
necessarily
must
be
in
the
courtroom,
or
would
a
video-conferencing
set-up
be
permissible
so
that
the
technician
or
the
analyst
could
testify
from
the
lab,
rather
--
but
it
would
be
screened
in
--
in
the
courthouse?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
defendant
didn't
give
his
consent,
so
we
don't
--
that's
not
a
concern,
but
let's
--
let's
suppose
defendant
doesn't
stipulate.
is
this
adequate
to
meet
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
what
--
that's
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
suggested,
didn't
they?
they
said
bring
the
printout
from
the
gas
--
whatever
--
chromatograph,
and
then
have
an
expert
who
was
not
the
one
who
certified
--
it
was
not
caylor
--
but
that
here's
the
graph
that
came
out
of
the
machine,
and
this
is
the
way
this
process
operates.
i
--
in
your
answer
to
justice
sotomayor,
did
you
mean
to
agree
with
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
when
they
said
printout
plus
an
analyst
who
didn't
do
this
particular
run
but
knows
how
the
process
works?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
answer
the
practical
situation
that
caylor,
who
did
this
particular
run,
does
some
dozens
day
in
and
day
out,
and
he
will
have
no
memory,
in
fact,
of
this
particular
test.
so
having
him
there
--
he
knows
how
the
process
operates;
he
doesn't
remember
this
particular
one
--
how
does
having
him
there
--
what
could
be
elicited
on
cross-examination
of
him
that
couldn't
be
from
his
supervisor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
principal
thrust
of
your
brief,
that
this
isn't
testimonial
at
all.
you
have
not
said
because
it
was
unsworn,
because
you
recognize
the
certification
is
the
same,
but
you're
trying
to
equate
it
to
a
business
record,
public
record?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
do
have
the
hurdle
that
this
record
was
created
for
a
specific
purpose.
it
was
created
to
provide
evidence
for
use
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general,
we
seem
to
be
describing
--
this
case
seemed
rather
particular,
that
is,
there
was
no
objection
by
new
mexico
to
having
an
analyst
show
up,
razatos;
so
--
so
he
had
to
travel
however
long
he
said.
it's
just
a
question
of
one
employee's
time
rather
than
the
other.
but
--
and
then
you
described
how
simple
this
thing
was,
you
just
put
it
in
a
machine,
you
would
get
out
a
piece
of
paper.
why
didn't
new
mexico
have
this
--
there
was
an
additional
sample
that
could
have
been
--
it
would
have
been
simple
to
just
retest
it.
having
the
witness
come
to
the
court,
why
don't
you
arm
him
with
the
additional
test,
and
then
there
would
be
no
controversy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
--
i
don't
follow
that
because
we
have
a
substitute
now.
caylor
is
out
of
the
picture;
we
know
that
it
is
the
defendant's
blood
because
everything
else
is
the
same,
and
there's
this
vial
that
has
a
certain
amount
of
blood
and
there's
a
certain
amount
left
over,
so
it's
not
cumulative,
because
caylor's
out
of
the
picture.
it
is
the
defendant's
blood
that
has
been
lab
tested
by
another
analyst.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
is
bullcoming
against
new
mexico.
the
sixth
amendment
provides
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding
shall
have
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
in
the
1980
decision,
ohio
v.
roberts,
this
court
interpreted
the
sixth
amendment's
confrontation
clause
to
allow
the
admission
of
an
absent
witness's
testimonial
statements
if
the
presiding
judge
finds
the
statements
reliable.
in
a
pathmarking
2004
decision,
crawford
v.
washington,
we
overruled
ohio
v.
roberts,
fidelity
to
the
confrontation
clause,
crawford
held,
permits
the
admission
of
an
absent
witness'
testimonial
statements
only
when
two
conditions
are
met.
first,
the
witness
is
unavailable.
second,
the
defendant
has
had
a
prior
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
five
years
after
crawford,
in
melendez-diaz
v.
massachusetts,
we
held
that
a
laboratory
report
identifying
a
substance
as
cocaine
ranked
as
“testimonial”
for
purposes
of
the
confrontation
clause.
absent
stipulation,
melendez-diaz
ruled,
the
prosecution
may
not
introduce
such
a
report
without
offering
a
live
witness
competent
to
testify
to
the
truth
of
the
statements
made
in
the
report.
in
the
case
before
us,
we
decide
who
that
live
witness
must
be.
petitioner
donald
bullcoming
was
arrested
on
charges
of
driving
while
intoxicated
or
dwi.
bullcoming's
prow
took
place
after
our
decision
in
crawford,
but
before
we
decided
melendez-diaz.
principle
evidence
against
bullcoming
was
a
laboratory
report
certifying
that
his
blood
alcohol
concentration
was
well
above
the
threshold
for
aggravated
dwi.
when
trial
began,
the
prosecution
announced
that
it
would
not
call
as
a
witness
curtis
caylor,
the
analyst
who
performed
the
test
on
bullcoming's
blood
sample.
in
lieu
of
caylor
who
had
been
placed
on
unpaid
leave
or
undisclosed
reasons,
the
state
called
another
analyst,
gerasimos
razatos.
razatos
was
familiar
with
the
laboratory's
testing
procedures
but
had
neither
participated
in
nor
observed
the
test
on
bullcoming's
blood
sample.
over
bullcoming's
objection,
the
trial
court
admitted
the
report
and
the
jury
convicted
him
of
aggravated
dwi.
on
appeal,
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
took
account
involved
in
very
recent
decision
in
melendez-diaz.
based
on
melendez-diaz,
new
mexico's
high
court
held
that
the
blood
alcohol
report
was
indeed
testimonial.
nevertheless,
that
court
further
held
the
prosecution
was
not
required
to
call
certifying
analyst
caylor,
for
lab
analyst
razatos'
testimony
supplies
to
satisfy
the
confrontation
clause.
the
new
mexico
supreme
court's
decision
prompted
bullcoming's
petition
asking,
"does
the
confrontation
clause
permit
the
prosecution
to
introduce
a
lab
report
containing
a
testimonial
certification
made
for
the
purpose
of
proving
a
particular
fact
at
trial
through
the
in-court
testimony
of
a
scientist
who
did
not
sign
the
certification
or
performed
or
observed
the
reported
test."
we
hold
that
surrogate
testimony
of
that
order
does
not
meet
the
constitutional
requirement.
the
accused
right
is
to
be
confronted
with
the
analyst
who
made
the
certification,
unless
that
analyst
is
unavailable
at
trial
and
the
accused
had
an
opportunity,
pretrial,
to
cross-examine
that
particular
scientist.
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
port
--
portrayed
certifying
analyst
caylor
as
a
mere
scrivener
who
simply
copied
and
placed
in
the
report
a
machine-generated
number,
but
caylor
affirmed
more
than
that.
he
certified
to
his
receipt
of
bullcoming's
blood
sample
intact
with
the
seal
unbroken.
he's
checked
to
make
sure
the
forensics
report
number
and
the
sample
number
corresponded.
his
performance
on
bullcoming's
sample
of
a
particular
test
adhering
to
the
prescribed
protocol
and
the
absence
of
many
circumstance
casting
doubt
on
the
integrity
of
the
sample
or
validity
of
the
analysis.
these
representations
relate
to
past
events
on
human
actions
not
revealed
in
raw
machine-produced
data.
they
are
often
subjects
for
cross-examination.
surrogate
testimony
of
the
kind
razatos
was
equipped
to
give
could
not
convey
what
caylor
knew
or
observed
about
the
events
his
certification
concerned,
nor
could
such
surrogate
testimony
expose
any
lapses
or
lies
on
the
certifying
analyst's
part.
a
particular
note,
razatos
knew
nothing
about
why
caylor
had
been
placed
on
unpaid
leave,
an
issue
on
which
cross-examine
--
examination
might
have
been
enlightening.
finally,
we
reject
the
state's
argument
that
no
confrontation
clause
question
ever
arose
in
this
case
because
the
blood
alcohol
analysis
reports
are
non-testimonial
in
character.
melendez-diaz
left
no
room
for
that
argument.
to
the
certificates
at
issue
in
melendez-diaz
were
notarized
while
the
report
introduced
at
bullcoming's
trial
was
unsworn.
but
it
would
make
no
sense
to
construe
the
confrontation
clause
to
render
inadmissible
only
sworn
affidavits
while
leaving
admission
of
formal,
but
unsworn
ex
parte
statements
perfectly
okay.
and
finally,
adhere
to
crawford
and
reiterate
today,
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
tolerate
dispensing
with
confrontation
simply
because
the
court
believes
that
questioning
one
witness
about
another's
testimonial
statements
provides
a
fair
enough
opportunity
for
cross-examination.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
new
mexico
supreme
court's
judgment
and
remand
for
a
determination
whether
the
confrontation
clause
error
at
bullcoming's
trial
was
harmless,
a
question
on
which
we
express
in
our
view.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice

and
