it's
not
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
not
just
chain
of
custody.
i
think
the
chief
justice
is
trying
to
get
at
this
problem,
or
i
am:
lab
technician
jones
looks
at
a
vial,
and
it's
blue.
she
says
to
smith,
"it's
blue".
smith
turns
a
lever
on
a
machine
to
b.
jason
sees
the
b
and
goes
into
court
--
you
make
him
go
into
court;
that's
our
case.
and
what
i
wonder
is,
is
the
defendant
now
entitled
to
the
following
instruction:
jury,
because
he's
in
court,
he
can
say
that
the
machine
read
b,
but
that
proves
nothing
about
the
vial,
nothing.
all
it
proves
is
what
someone
said
in
the
laboratory
to
another
person,
and
those
two
people
aren't
in
court.
now,
that's
--
you
see,
that's
the
problem,
i
think,
of
the
intermediate
step.
i'd
either
like
to
be
told
i'm
wrong
about
that,
you
don't
have
to
have
them,
or
explain
whatever
you'd
like.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
might
want
that
in
order
to
show
the
machine
says
x,
y,
z,
but
that's
only
as
good
as
the
stuff
that
was
put
into
it.
so
you're
going
to
have
to
show
that
this
was
his
blood
put
into
it.
and
many,
many
people
might
have
handled
it,
and
there
might
be
a
routine
so
that
they
all
check
a
box
when
it's
sealed
and
they
get
it.
is
it
your
understanding
if
you
lose
these
cases
--
this
case
that
you
then
have
to
take
into
court
all
those
people?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
the
reason
i
asked
the
question
is
because
i
don't
think
it
is
normally
contested.
it's
normally
a
business
record
of
some
kind.
however,
what
i
was
looking
for
is
a
distinction,
because
in
the
future
i
don't
see
why
it
wouldn't
be
contested,
unless
there's
a
distinction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
there
states
--
are
there
states
that
do
require
a
--
a
--
a
prosecutor
to
produce
everyone
who
has
handled
something
in
a
chain
of
custody
at
a
--
at
a
laboratory,
a
criminal
--
you
know,
normal
business?
are
there
states
that
do
require
that?
if
so,
could
you
tell
me
a
couple,
because
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
about
medical
reports
that
are
aimed
at
a
particular
known
victim
of
a
crime
and
thus
will
end
up
in
trial?
for
example,
a
graph,
a
graph
which
the
nurse
keeps,
which
is
a
statement
by
the
nurse
that
the
patient's
temperature
on
such
and
such
a
day
was
98.6
or
whatever,
and
normally
that
graph
would
be
introduced;
but
are
there
any
states
that
wouldn't
require
--
would
say,
oh,
no,
you
have
to
produce
the
nurse?
you
have
to
produce
the
doctor
for
all
medical
records?
which
of
course,
are
known
by
the
keeper
that
they
will
be
used
at
the
criminal
trial.
are
there
any
states
that
require
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
there
any
states
that
require
ordinary
business
records
perhaps
of
the
most
ordinary
kind,
which
always
are
statements
that
somebody
did
something
on
a
particular
day?
when
those
business
records
happen
to
be
kept
before
with
the
knowledge
that
they'll
probably
be
introduced
at
the
trial,
are
there
states
that
require
the
man
or
woman
who
made
the
business
record
to
come
into
court?
