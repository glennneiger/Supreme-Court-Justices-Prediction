justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
there
are
different
types
of
hearsay
involved
here
or
different
types
of
statements.
there's
the
report
itself,
which
was
exhibit
1
that
was
introduced,
and
it
has
certain
certifications
by
the
analyst,
that
he
followed
certain
procedures,
et
cetera.
i'm
assuming
that
you're
claiming
that
those
--
those
are
the
confrontation
clause
violations,
that
exhibit
itself,
because
it
is
attesting
or
certifying
to
something.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
witness
is
not
at
trial
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
where
i
want--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
--
the
"also"
is
what
i
summarized
in
saying
that
he
followed
certain
procedures,
that
it
was
in
accordance
with
law,
et
cetera.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now
--
if
i
might
just
finish
my
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
that
the
raw
data,
the
graphs
that
were
made,
were
reviewed
by
a
separate
witness,
and
he
reviewed
the
data
and
says,
this
data
shows
that
the
blood
level
concentration
was.21,
or
two-point
whatever
it
was.
would
that
violate
the
confrontation
clause,
using
the
raw
data
itself?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
printout
from
the
machine.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
wasn't
introduced
here;
am
i
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
but
let's
assume--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--let's
assume
he
just
took
the
raw
data
at
trial.
i
know
we
now
have
a
chain
of
custody,
and
someone
will
have
to
prove
that
this
is
the
data
related--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
mr.
bullcoming.
but
if
that
expert
then
read
that
data
and
testified
that
this
was
of
a
certain
amount
or
percentage
of
alcohol,
would
that
violate
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
part--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
part
do
you
see
as
testimonial
or
not?
what
can
an
outside
expert
look
at?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
--
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--there's
two
different
issues:
one,
what
can
be
introduced
into
evidence,
which
is
the
reports
themselves;
and
what
can
he
or
she
testify
to
is
a
different
question.
that's
a
form
of
evidence.
and
so
that's
the
line
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
describe
for
me,
which
is,
when
does
that
testimony
become
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
the
hypothetical
i
proffered.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
could
you
tell
me
what
that
means?
why
is
it
different
than
the
affidavit?
it's
certified,
and
my
understanding
of
the
dictionary
meaning
of
certification
is
that
that's
an
attestation
as
to
the
truth
of
the
statements
contained
therein.
that's
the
common
definition.
so
i'm
assuming
it's
the
equivalent
of
an
affidavit.
so
how
is
it
different
than
the
melendez-diaz
lab
report?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
me
why
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
any--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
he's
not
simply
looking
at
a
number
and
putting
it
on
a
report.
he's
certifying
to
certain
things.
he's
certifying
to
following
certain
steps,
that
the
evidence
wasn't
tampered
with.
he's
certifying
that
he's
complied
with
all
the
requirements
of
new
mexico
law
with
respect
to
the
report,
so
he's
just
not
copying
a
number.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
the
difference
between
those
two
documents
is
that
one
was
prepared
primarily
for
the
purposes
--
this
lab
report,
for
prosecution
purposes,
and
the
birth
certificate
is
not
prepared
for
that?
it's
prepared
to
mark
the
birth
of
a
person,
then
it's
used
for
many
other
purposes
besides
trial;
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
tell
me
what
makes
this
certificate
not
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
use
in
the
prosecution
of
an
individual?
would
they
have
tested
this
blood
if
--
if
it
wasn't
to
prosecute
him?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
he
do
any
testing
except
for
the
police?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
who
else
do
they
test
for?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
did
you
give
the
data
to
the
analyst
at
trial?
if
there
wasn't
a
more
persuasive
power
in
the
lab
certification,
why
didn't
you
just
have
the
new
expert
look
at
the
printout
from
the
graph
and
say,
this
is
what
it
says?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
that
as
well.
don't
you
introduce
the
lab
report
because
it
--
it
gives
more
credence
to
the
reliability
of
the
result?
because
he's
certifying
that
he
followed
certain
procedures,
that
he
did
certain
things,
that
the
sample
wasn't
tampered
with?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
it
--
you're
looking
for
that
testimony,
correct?
you're
looking,
at
trial,
to
that
testimony
to
bolster
the
test?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
