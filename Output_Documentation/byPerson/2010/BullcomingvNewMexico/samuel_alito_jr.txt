justice
samuel

well,
that's
not
--
i
don't
think
that's
what
melendez-diaz'
footnote
1
says.
it
says
that
the
state
may
be
able
to
prove
chain
of
custody
by
testimony
other
than
the
actual
individuals
who
handled
the
sample,
and
then
it
has
to
take
its
chances
as
to
whether
the
trier
of
fact
is
going
to
believe
--
is
going
to
believe
that.
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
as
to
those
persons
who--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--okay.
go
ahead.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
we
break
this
down
in
--
in
this
way?
i
see
three
things
that
the
--
three
statements
that
the
--
the
state
was
attempting
to
--
to
prove.
the
first
was
that
the
sample
that
was
tested
was
the
sample
that
was
taken
from
the
defendant.
second
was
that
the
standard
procedures
were
followed
in
this
case,
and
the
third
was
that
the
result
was.21.
would
you
agree
with
that?
those
are
the
three
things?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
the
sample
had
not
been
tampered
with.
now,
as
to
the
first
three,
in
other
words,
everything
other
than
the
results,
could
the
state
prove
those
things
without
having
--
simply
by
introducing
testimony
regarding
the
way
things
were
generally
done
in
the
lab,
and
ask
the
jury
to
infer
that
the
general
procedures
were
followed
in
this
particular
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
wouldn't
be
a
confrontation--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--all
right.
now,
in
this
case,
as
i
read
the
record,
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
the
prosecutor
was
attempting
to
do.
this
is
on
page
50
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
analyst
is
beginning
to
testify,
the
second
answer
on
page
50:
so
what
we
do
is
we
will
get
the
sample
in
the
mail,
et
cetera.
the
analyst
is
beginning
to
testify
about
standard
lab
procedures,
and
then
defense
attorney
says,
"your
honor,
i'm
going
to
object
to
what's
done
in
the
status
quo.
"
i
take
that
to
mean
what
is
generally
done.
"i
don't
object
to
what
was
done
in
this
case.
"
so
the
defense
attorney
is
preventing
--
is
objecting
to
the
prosecution's
attempting
to
discharge
its
responsibility
with
respect
to
those
first
three
propositions
through
testimony
about
standard
procedures,
and
is
insisting
that
the
analyst
provide
the
testimony
that
you
say
was
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause;
namely,
testifying
as
to
what
was
done
in
this
particular
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
the
--
if
the
machine
had
expelled
a
piece
of
paper
that
said.21,
that
piece
of
paper
would
not
be
a
--
introduction
of
that
piece
of
paper,
the
contents
of
the
piece
of
paper,
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
can
--
how
can
you
debate
it?
the
purpose
of
the
confrontation
clause
is
to
allow
cross-examination.
how
are
you
going
to
cross-examine
the
machine?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
all
of
those
other
things
could
potentially
be
proven
by
indirect
evidence,
by
establishing
standard
procedures
and
asking
the
jury
to
infer
that
the
standard
procedures
were
followed
in
this
case.
they
might
--
they
might
believe
that;
they
might
not--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--they
might
make
the
inference;
they
might
not.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
as
to
this
case,
didn't
the
defendant
actually
testify
that
he
was
drunk
at
the
time
of
--
at
the
time
when
the
blood
was
extracted?
he
took
the
stand
and
he
testified
that
after
the
accident
he
went
off
into
the
woods
and
he
came
upon
people
who
were
drinking
vodka
and
he
drank,
they
drank
--
what
was
it
--
a
gallon
of
vodka
together,
and
then
he
went
back
to
the
scene
and
his
blood
was
tested?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
state
can't--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
state
can't
immunize
those
people
from
testifying.
you
could
have
subpoenaed
caylor,
couldn't
you?
you
could
have
asked
for
a
continuance
and
--
and
a
subpoena,
and
brought
him
in
to
testify?
it's
just
a
question
of
who
has
to
take
the
step,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
these
lab
analysts
civil
service
employees?
are
the
lab
analysts
civil
service
employees?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
any
way
in
which
your
office
or
prosecutors
or
the
police
could
cause
them
not
to
get
promotions
if
they
weren't
producing
the
kind
of
lab
reports
that
the
police
and
the
prosecution
might
like?
