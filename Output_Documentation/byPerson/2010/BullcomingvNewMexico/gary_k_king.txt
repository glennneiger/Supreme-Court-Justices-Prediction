mr.
gary
k.
king
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
court
said
in
michigan
v.
bryant,
a
police
interrogation
resembles
an
ex
parte
examination
when
the
primary
purpose
of
the
interrogation
is
to
create,
quote,
an
out-of-court
substitute
for
trial
testimony,
end
quote.
a
public
record
not
prepared
by
a
police
officer
is
not
the
product
of
structured
interrogation.
it
is
neither
ex
parte
nor
is
it
an
examination.
mr.
gary
k.
king
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--it
is
not
my
point,
your
honor.
your
honor,
the
point
that
i
am
making
is
that
in
this
case,
the
document,
the
report
that
we're
talking
about
is
a
public
record,
and
that
differentiates
it
from
the
affidavit
in
melendez-diaz,
and
so
the
case
that--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--your
honor,
and
i
understand,
and
i'll
answer
your
question
with
regard
to
your
expectation
that
the
certification
is
the
same
as
the
affidavit.
it's
not
our
position
that
they're
exactly
the
same,
but
there
are
several--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--there
are
other
distinguishing
--
distinguishing
features
that
are
significant
between
the
affidavit
in
melendez-diaz
and
the
report
in
this
case.
for
one,
the
affidavit
in
melendez-diaz
was
prepared
pursuant
to
an
statute
in
massachusetts
that
called
for
the
preparation
of
an
affidavit
from
the
lab
at
some
point
in
time
after
the
actual
test
was
done,
and
it
was
to
be
used
specifically
as
an
in-court
statement
to
replace
the
live
in-court
testimony
of
the
affiant.
in
our
case,
the
report
being
a
public
record
was
a
record
that
is
kept
contemporaneously
by
the
analyst
in
the
lab,
it
is,
in
this
case,
the.21
is
a
single
data
point
that
is
taken
from
the
raw
data
in
the
machine
and
recorded
on
a
standard
document
that's
provided
by
the--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
--
that
that
statement
is
planned
to
be
used
in
trial,
and--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--your
honor,
i
think
the
key
is
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
analyst
who
was
preparing
the
report,
who
is
a
public
employee,
who
is
just
carrying
out,
as
our
court
said,
copying
the
information
from
the
machine
onto
the
report.
and
so,
that's
significantly
different
than
the
amount
of
analysis
that
was
done
by
--
by
the
--
the
witness
in--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
--
in
this
case
the
certification
doesn't
necessarily
make
the
report
testimonial.
there
--
there
are
several
other
examples
of
--
of
cases
where
--
where
evidence
is
introduced
at
court
that
--
that
have
certifications.
for
instance,
it
may
be
necessary
for
a
public
records
custodian
to
provide
a
copy
of
a
birth
certificate
in
--
in
a
trial,
and
in
that
case,
the
custodian
always
has
a
certification
that
says
i
certify--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--that
is
correct
with
regard
to
the
birth
--
birth
certificate,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
k.
king
your
honor,
in
--
in
this
case,
no.
this
--
this
case
is
all
about
a
sample
that
was
sent
to
the
lab
to
be
tested
for
this.
but
i
think
you
made
it
clear
in
michigan
v.
bryant
that
--
that
there
might
be
a
variety
of
purposes
that
should
be
analyzed
in
order
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
statement
is
testimonial
or
not.
in
this
case,
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
lab
analyst
is
significantly
different
from
the
purpose
of
the
police
officer
who
requested
the
analysis.
the
lab
analyst
does
this
for
a
living,
and
it's
--
it's
their
public
duty.
the
lab
in
this
case
is
--
is
operated
by
the
state
department
of
health,
scientific
lab
division,
and
--
and
they
do
a
variety
of
different
kinds
of
analysis.
and
so,
the
--
the
analyst
who
does
the
test
wouldn't
necessarily
have
the
same
purpose
in
--
in
creating
their
statement
for
that
document.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
analyst
would
most
likely
be
driven
by
the
desire
as
a
scientist--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
k.
king
this
lab
also
tests
for,
in
this
particular
case,
the
gas
chromatograph
analyses
of
blood
alcohol,
they
test
for
the
office
of
the
medical
examiner
and
--
and
under
new
mexico
law,
interestingly
enough,
the
--
the
defendant
can
also
ask
for
a
test.
they
would
use
the
same
form
to
ask
for
this
test.
so,
the
analysis
might
be
being
done
for
a
defendant
as
well
as
for
the
state.
mr.
gary
k.
king
yes,
your
honor,
they
are.
they
work
for
the
new
mexico
department
of
health.
mr.
gary
k.
king
no,
your
honor,
they
could
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
--
there
is
a
separation
between
the
operation
of
the
department
of
health
lab
and
the
police
that
even
extends
to
the
point
of
a
physical
separation.
police
officers
are
not
allowed
into
the
lab
area
where
--
where
they
are--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--no,
your
honor,
the
record
indicates
that
--
that
mr.
caylor
was
not
available
for
court
because
he
was
on
leave
without
pay,
which--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--uh-huh.
mr.
gary
k.
king
we
don't
know
why,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
k.
king
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
that
the
defense
would
like
to
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
gary
k.
king
no,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
that's
--
that's
not
the
case.
i
--
the
--
this
case
came
about
in
a
little
bit
of
an
unusual
circumstance,
because
both
sides
had
been
negotiating
a
plea
agreement
and
when
the
--
when
the
plea
agreement
was
not
successful,
the
defendant
asked
for
the
trial
to
be
expedited
and
moved
quickly
to
trial.
so
the
defendant
didn't
do
as
much
discovery,
i
think,
as
you
would
normally
do
in
a
case
like
that,
but--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
key
here
is
that
if
you
would
not
look
at
the
--
at
any
of
the
qualities
of
the
declarant
in
deciding
whether
the
statement
is
testimonial
or
not.
and
so
once
--
once
the
court
makes
the
determination
as
to
whether
it
is
testimonial
or
not,
you
wouldn't
--
even
if
you
would
like
to
ask
those
questions,
you
wouldn't
have
the
opportunity
to
ask
those
questions.
in
this
case,
factually,
it
might
also
be
that
mr.
caylor
was
on
unpaid
leave
because
he
had
run
out
of
his
regular
leave
time,
and
he
decided
to
do
that.
we
--
it
would
all
be
speculation--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--your
honor,
i
think
that's
why
it's
--
it's
important
that
this
is
a
public
records
case,
because
that
is
one
of
the
assumptions
that
courts
have
made
for
hundreds
of
years
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
there
is
--
there
is
a
duty
by
the
person
who's
taking
down
the
information
to
--
to
observe
in
a
regular
manner,
to
record
in
a
regular
manner,
and
so
that's
important
here.
mr.
gary
k.
king
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
k.
king
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
only
purpose
that
this
form
705
could
be
used
for.
it
is
the
common
purpose
for
this
form,
but
it
is
a
form
that
the
lab
uses
in
every
circumstance.
and
indeed,
as
i
said,
in
new
mexico
law,
the
defendant
can
ask
for
a
second
test.
they
can
have
that
done.
it's
done
at
the
state's
expense.
they
can
have
it
done
at
any
laboratory
that
they
want
to.
but
if
they
have
the
report
done
at
the
state
lab,
and
they're
entitled
to
have
that
done,
they
would
utilize
the
same
form.
mr.
gary
k.
king
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
--
i
actually
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
specifically
except
that
the
form
--
and
if
you
look
at
it,
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
--
does
have
some
information
in
part
a
that
--
that
indicates
that
there
is
a
police
officer
that
--
that
sent
the
test
to
the
lab.
there's
a
nurse
that
did
that
in
this
case.
mr.
gary
k.
king
they
--
i
think
that
the
same
information
would
be
on
the
form
whether
the
defendant
submitted
it
or
whether
the
--
or
whether
the
prosecution
submitted
it,
and--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--your
honor--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--if
you
look
at
the
form,
your
honor,
it
would
have
the
same
information,
but
we're
not
--
we're
not
here
today
arguing
that
the
analyst
wouldn't
know
that
the
police
submitted
this
form.
but
it
is
an
arm's
length
request,
and
once
again,
the
court
addressed
that
in
your
most
recent
case,
in
michigan
v.
bryant,
i
believe
because
the
--
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
was
an
interrogation.
one
of
the
key
questions
is
whether
there
was
an
interrogation.
this
clearly
does
not
look
like
a
case
where
there
was
an
interrogation
by
the
police.
it
was
a
request
on
a
standard
form
that
was
--
that
was
sent.
and
so
the
purpose
test,
it
appears
from
michigan
v.
bryant,
would
not
even
apply
in
cases
where
there's
not
a
police
interrogation.
mr.
gary
k.
king
your
honor,
the
analysis
would
be
somewhat
different.
that's
the
point,
is
that--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--your
honor,
we
--
it
appears
that
it
does
make
some
difference
with
regard
to
michigan
v.
bryant,
and
it's
new
to
all
of
us.
mr.
gary
k.
king
well,
the
relevance,
your
honor,
i
think,
is
since
it's
not
an
interrogation,
then
--
then
you
have
to
look
at,
and
i
think
the
court
has
set
this
out,
you
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
evidence
and
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
evidence
that's
being
presented
is
merely
a
substitute
for
live,
in-court
testimony.
and
there,
back
to
the
difference
between
the
affidavit
in
melendez-diaz
and
the
report
in
this
case
is,
in
our
report,
even
if
mr.
caylor
had
been
at
the
trial
and
on
the
stand,
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
have
the
report
as
well.
i
think
justice
ginsburg
raised
this
point,
is
that
six
months
after
the
examination
was
done,
to
cross-examine
the
analyst
and
ask
him,
do
you
remember
what
the
result
was
six
months
ago
from
this
one
test
out
of
a
hundred
that
he
ran,
he
will
not
remember
without
looking
at
the
report.
the
report
is
the
best
evidence
in
this
case
to
prove
the
point
that
is
being
made
here,
and--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
so
that's
why
the
analysis
of
whether
this
is
testimonial
or
not
is
such
an
important
analysis,
because
if
the
--
the
reasoning
that
the
court
has
had
for
all
of
the
hearsay
exceptions,
for
excited
utterances
or,
in
this
case,
for
a
public
record,
would
look
at
whether
or
not
that
evidence
was
the
best
evidence
to
support
the
truth-finding
purpose
of
the
trial.
that's
our
--
that's
our
analysis,
at
least,
your
honor.
and
what
we
are
arguing
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
no
difference
between
mr.
caylor
transferring
the.21
data
from
the
machine
to
the
piece
of
paper
than
there
would
be
if
you
took
a
photograph,
for
instance,
of
the
machine
data
and--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--procedurally,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
this
--
the
trial
at
the
district
court
level
occurred
before
the
court's
opinion
in
melendez-diaz.
and
so
i
think
that
at
this
point
in
time,
that
it
would
be
more
normal
behavior
for
the
--
for
the
state
to
present
the
raw
data
as
well.
in
this
case,
mr.
razatos--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
k.
king
not
using
testimony
in
the
sense
that
we're
talking
about
testimony
here.
i
mean,
you
might
want
that
--
very
well
want
that
evidence
in,
not
different
from
other
cases
where
if
you
had
a
--
it
was
necessary
to
submit
the
judgment
of
a
felony,
for
instance,
to
show
that
a
person
in
a
later
trial
was
a
felon
with
--
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm,
you
would
have
a
certification
from
the
court
clerk
that
would
say,
i
certify
that
the
copy
of
this
document
that
i'm
submitting
to
the
court
is
a
true
copy
of
--
that's
also
not
testimonial
from
--
for
the
purposes
of
the
confrontation
clause
i
don't
believe.
mr.
gary
k.
king
that's
certainly
a
concern,
your
honor.
i
--
if
you
look
at
this
document,
there
are
six
or
seven
people
who
have
certifications
on
the
--
on
the
dire
--
different
statements
on
the
document.
there
are
three
certifications;
there's
one
from
the
--
from
the
woman
who
takes
the
samples
into
the
lab
that
says
she
received
the
samples;
there's
this
one
from
mr.
caylor;
there's
one
from
--
from
the
reviewing
analyst
who
reviews
it;
and
i
gather
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner
is
only
challenging
the
--
that
one
certification
from
--
from
--
from
mr.
caylor.
mr.
gary
k.
king
it
was
not.
and
this
document--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--i'm
not
aware
of
it
being
contested
often,
your
honor,
i
--
and
this
form
i
think
is
one
of
the
things
in
new
mexico
that
really
helps
with
that.
the
reason
that
the
court
submitted
the
form
is
that
you
have
everything
relating
to
the
chain
of
evidence
on
--
on
one
document,
and
--
and
so
indeed
a
lot
of
those
statements
really
help--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
the
distinction
is
that
in
this
case
the
--
the
analyst
is
not
essentially
a
party
to
the
action.
the
analyst
works
arm's-length
transaction
from
--
from
the
--
from
the
police
and
from
the
prosecutors,
and
so
he's
not
part
of
the
prosecution
team,
is
--
is
how
i've
been
thinking
about
it.
mr.
gary
k.
king
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
are
other
states
that
have
statutes
that
--
that
have
different
ways
of
presenting
evidence.
mr.
gary
k.
king
your
honor,
we
--
we
understand
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
burden
on
the
state
is
--
is
not
an
issue
that
comes
directly
into
the
analysis
relating
to
the
confrontation
clause.
i
--
in
new
mexico,
for
instance,
one
of
the
problems
that
we
have
is
that
--
is
that
the
lab's
centrally
located
in
albuquerque
and
the
--
and
in
this
case
the
trial
was
in
san
juan
county,
so
--
so
the
witness
has
to
drive
for
about
3
hours
to
get
to
where
the
courthouse
is.
so
that's
sort
of
different
in
new
mexico
than,
say,
in
massachusetts
or
something
like
that.
and
--
and
even
for
10
minutes
worth
of
testimony,
they
might
have
to
drive
6
hours
and
take
a
whole
day
out
of
the
lab.
so
it
--
it
is
a
problem
that
--
that
is
there,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
is
the
seminal
issue
that--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
state
that
requires
that
everyone
in
the
chain
of
custody
appear
in
--
in
trial.
it
is
indeed
normally
up
to
the
prosecutor
with
regard
to
chain
of
custody
to
determine
who
--
who
is
going
to
be
appearing.
mr.
gary
k.
king
there
are
none
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
--
i
haven't--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--no,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
the
point
of
all
of
those.
state
law
has
their
--
their
hearsay
law
that
--
that
analyzed
whether
those
statements
are
admissible.
mr.
gary
k.
king
your
honor,
i
think
the
hypothetical
that
--
that
you
say
really
shows
where
the
line
is.
if
--
if
the
lab
is
a
police
lab
and
only
doing
the
analysis
for
the
police,
then
they
--
they
look
a
lot
more
like
a
party
to
the
--
to
the
lawsuit,
and
certainly
the
hearsay
exceptions
have
made
it
clear
that
even
though
observations
are
--
are
generally
--
that
are
public
records
are
generally
allowed,
that
observations
by
police
officers
are
not.
and
--
and
so--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--your
honor,
i
think
that
that
depends
on
--
on
how
you
look
at
the
purpose
and
whose
purpose
it
is
that
--
that
you're
analyzing.
now
first
off
that,
would
assume
that
the
purpose
test
applies
in
this
case,
and
it
seems
to
me
since
michigan
v.
bryant
that
the
purpose
test
may
not
apply
to
these
kinds
of
cases
where
--
where
there's
not
a
police
interrogation.
but
if
--
if
that
is
the
case
and
the
purpose
test
applies,
then
it
--
it
also
appears
to
me
that
the
--
that
the
test
now
requires
that
--
that
you
look
not
just
at
the
purpose
of
the
policeman
who
--
who's
asking
the
question,
but
that
you
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
declarant,
and
in
this
case
the
purpose
of
the
labs
clearly
is
--
is
a
purpose
just
to
--
to
get
the
sample,
do
a
good
analysis,
and
--
and
report
that
analysis
to,
in
new
mexico's
case,
both
parties.
mr.
gary
k.
king
the
analysis
that
comes
from
our
state
lab
goes
not
only
to
the
prosecution
but
also
to
the
defendant.
mr.
gary
k.
king
your
honor,
one
of
the
problems
in
new
mexico
would
be
since
--
since
the
court
believed
that
--
that
that
report
was
--
was
admissible,
if
they
did
a
second
sample
and
--
and
tried
to
submit
that
it
would
be
cumulative
evidence,
and
probably
would
be
kept
out
by
--
by
the
rule
in
new
mexico
in
that
case.
so
mr.
razatos
did
have
an
important
purpose
at
this
trial.
in
new
mexico
you
still
i
believe
have
to
have
a
witness
who
--
who
can
authenticate
the
document
to
bring
the
document
in.
it
might
not
have
had
to
have
been
mr.
razatos
in
this
case.
mr.
gary
k.
king
it's
not
the
rule,
your
honor,
although
one
of
the
things
that
we
pointed
out
is
that
--
is
that
the
state
always
keeps
two
samples,
that
the
defendant
has
the
right
statutorily
in
new
mexico
to
--
to
have
a
sample
retested
at
a
lab--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
k.
king
yes.
mr.
gary
k.
king
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
in
--
in
your
hypothetical,
if
--
if
the
state
knew
far
enough
ahead
of
time
that
they
--
they
would
not
be
able
to
submit
the
--
the
--
that
analyst's
results,
they
could
always
--
because
the
blood
sample
continues
to
exist,
they
could
always
retest
that
and
--
and
have
another
witness
who
could
do
that.
depending
on
how
the
court
rules
in
this
case,
it
might
be
that
states
will
be
required
to
do
that.
but
at
this
point
in
time
under
--
under
the
current
jurisprudence,
it
--
it
didn't
appear
to
the
state
that
they
needed
to
retest
the
sample,
and
i
think
you
have
to
worry
a
little
bit
about
--
about
how
many
people
you
might
indeed
have
to
have
come
into
court
and
testify
if
--
if
the
state
--
if
the
burden
on
the
state
is
that
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
sample
twice
just
in
case
you're
going
to
lose
one
of
your
analysts,
i
--
i
think
that
that
does
indeed
put
a
great
burden
on
the
state
to
do
that.
and
so--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
k.
king
i
think
that
you
have
to
do
the
analysis
in
each
kind
of
statement
that
you're
looking
at,
your
honor,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
statement
that's
--
that's
being
made
and
that's
being
proposed
for
trial
is
a
substitute
for
live
in-court
testimony.
and
so,
with
regard
to
ballistics,
you
know,
you
would
be
looking
at
a
little
bit
different
set
of
facts.
but
in
this
case
the
facts
are
that
--
that
the
gas
chromatograph
gave
us
a
printout
that
said
that
the
--
that
the
level
of
alcohol
in
the
blood
is.21
grams
per
100
milliliters,
mr.
caylor
transferred
that
to
a
form,
and
that's
what
we
are
putting
in.
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
it
proves
the
point
that
i'm
talking
about,
in
a
ballistics
analysis,
you
would
have
to
have
some
analysis
and
someone
to
reach
a
conclusion.
and
it's
that
that
sets
melendez-diaz
apart
from
this
case,
is
--
is
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
some
analysis
by
--
by
--
by
the
--
the
declarant
in
that
case.
and
in
the
ballistics
cases
i
think,
most
often,
you
would
find
that.
now,
if
the
--
if
in
the
ballistics
case
you
just
took
a
photograph
of
the
bullet
and
wanted
to
bring
that
into
the
court
and
say
here's
what
the
bullet
looks
like,
the
jury
then
could
make
a
determination
whether
they
think
that
that
bullet
appears
to
be
the
same
as
the
other.
that
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
confrontation
clause.
mr.
gary
k.
king
and
--
and--
mr.
gary
k.
king
--may
i
answer
the
question,
your
honor?
mr.
gary
k.
king
in
--
in
that
case,
if
--
if
the
machine
were
able
to
do
all
of
that,
the
machine
essentially
is
giving
you
the
best
evidence,
yes,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
the
case.
