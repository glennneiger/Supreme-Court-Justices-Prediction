in

bullcoming
v.
new
mexico.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
fisher,
what
if
you
had
two
people
doing
this
procedure?
they're
sitting
in,
you
know,
chairs
right
next
to
the
other.
the
one,
you
know,
takes
the
blood
samples
from
the
vials,
puts
them
in
another
vial,
and
puts
the
aluminum
stuff
on
and
crimps
it.
the
other
one
then
takes
the
vials
and
puts
them
in
the
machine
and
runs
it.
do
you
have
to
have
both
of
them
testify?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
they
want
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they
want
to
present
the
results
of
the
blood
analysis--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
numbers
the
machine
spits
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
one--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
though
one
didn't
do
it?
even
though
the
question
is
going
to
be,
did
you
put
the
aluminum
on
and
crimp
it,
and
the
answer
is
going
to
be,
no,
joe
did
it;
he
sits
right
next
to
me?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
that's
right.
does
--
do
they
both
have
to
testify,
then,
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
general
king.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
does
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--does
the
analyst
know
whether
he's
being
asked
to
do
one
for
the
prosecution
or
the
defendant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
so
they
would
know
the
difference,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
depends
on
when
they
do
it,
of
course.
i
mean,
you
have
the
right
to
look
at
their
evidence
presumably
so
--
so
far
in
advance
of
trial,
whatever,
and
if
they
had
to
get
a
new
--
new
technician,
that
would
have
to
put
off
the
trial--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
