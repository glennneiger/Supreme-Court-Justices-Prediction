mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
text,
purpose,
and
history
of
the
confrontation
clause
make
it
clear
that
the
prosecution
cannot
introduce
one
person's
testimonial
statements
through
the
in-court
testimony
of
someone
else.
thus,
having
held
in
melendez-diaz
that
a
lab
analyst's
statements
in
a
forensic
lab
report
are
testimonial,
this
is
an
easy
case.
the
state
violated
the
confrontation
clause
by
introducing
lab
analyst
curtis
caylor's
statements
in
a
forensic
lab
report
without
putting
him
on
the
stand.
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
resisted
this
analysis,
straightforward
as
it
is,
on
the
ground
that
mr.
bullcoming,
as
the
defendant,
had
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
a
substitute
or
a
surrogate
witness,
mr.
razatos.
but
a
surrogate
witness
procedure
violates
all
four
components
of
the
right
to
confrontation.
it
quite
obviously
violates
the
defendant's
right
to
have
the
witness
testify
in
his
presence,
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
so
the
jury
can
observe
it,
and
under
oath,
as
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
the
default
rule
under
the
confrontation
clause
is
in
presence,
in
the
courtroom.
now,
in
maryland
v.
craig,
this
court
held
in
a
child
witness
setting
--
of
course,
very
different
than
this
case
--
that
closed-circuit
tv
would
be
permissible,
and
i
believe,
you
know,
in
a
future
case,
if
the
state
perhaps
made
some
sort
of
showing
that
the
lab
analyst
couldn't
come
to
court
for
some
reason,
and
certainly
if
the
defendant
stipulated,
and
maybe
even
if
the
defendant
didn't
stipulate,
a
court
could
accommodate--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
adequate,
justice
ginsburg,
with
at
least
some
--
absent
at
least
some
showing
of
unavailability
of
the
witness
or
--
making
the
witness
unable
to
come
to
court.
now
--
now,
there
is
an
amicus
brief
in
the
case,
i
believe,
that
suggests
some
flexibility
that
trial
judges
might
employ
in
--
in
accommodating
lab
analysts'
schedules.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
that's
never
been--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
never
been
the
rule,
justice
scalia,
and
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
need
to--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
one
is,
and
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case,
because
the
state
never
attempted
to
make
any
showing
that
mr.
caylor
was
unavailable
for
any
reason.
this--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--only
if
the
state
wants
to
present
statements
from
them
both.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
they
both--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
in
that
scenario,
if
both
people
were
there
for
the
whole
thing,
the
state
could
have
either
one
of
them
testify.
what
the
state
couldn't
do--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--and
this
is
the
rule--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right.
the
confrontation
clause
is
a
purely
procedural
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
they
do
not
have
to.
the
confrontation
clause
is
a
purely
procedural
right.
it
all
depends
on
what
--
whose
statements
the
state
wants
to
introduce.
so,
if
the
state
is
satisfied
to
prove
its
case
by
having
somebody
testify,
saying,
i
watched
the
thing
go
into
the
machine
and
i
watched
this
result
come
out
and
i
saw
that
it
wasn't
tampered
with
and
it
was
mr.
bullcoming's
sample,
then
that
would
be
fine.
and
in
fact,
what
some
labs
do--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--again,
the
question,
justice
kennedy,
is
not
who
the
state
has
to
bring
in.
the
question
is
whose
statements
the
state
wants
to
introduce.
here,
the
state
wanted
to
introduce
mr.
caylor's
statements,
and
so
it
therefore
needs
to--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--if
only
--
if
the
state
is
only
introducing
one
person--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
i
--
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
it's
hearsay.
it's
simply
being
an
eyewitness
and
saying:
here's
what
i
watched.
i
watched
this
person
put
it
into
the
machine,
and
this
is
the
result
that
i
saw
come
out.
now,
again,
the
only
question
is
whose
statements
the
state
wants
to
introduce.
by
all
means,
mr.
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy,
if
the
state
wanted
to
introduce
statements
from
both
of
the
lab
analysts
who
worked
together
on
the
case,
they
would
need
to
bring
them
both
in,
but
if
they
only
want
to
introduce
one
lab--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right.
that's
the
decision
the
state
makes
in
every
case,
whether
it
be
multiple
police
investigators,
multiple
eyewitnesses,
or--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
not
sure
i
--
i
disagree
with
anything
you
said,
but
the
rule
of
the
confrontation
clause
applies
to
a
particular
kind
of
statements,
testimonial
statements.
and
our
rule
today
and
the
one
that
resolves
this
case
is,
if
the
state
wants
to
introduce
a
witness's
testimonial
statements,
it
needs
to
bring
that
witness
to
court.
now,
footnote
1
in
melendez-diaz--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes,
i
believe
it
would
be,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
and,
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that's
what
footnote
1
in
melendez-diaz
says.
if
the
defendant
wants
to
challenge
the
chain
of
custody,
then
the
state
needs
to
bring
in
the
witnesses.
now,
i
think
it's
an
interesting
fact
in
this
case,
and
it
shows
why
that
rule
isn't
so--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that's
right.
i
think
what
footnote
1
says
is
the
defendant
--
when
the
state
chooses
whose
testimony
it
wants
to
introduce,
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
insist
that
that
be
done
live.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
of
course,
that's
correct
under
the
notice
and
demand
regimes
that
melendez-diaz
approved
of.
and
the
public
--
the
pds
brief
in
this
case
showed
that
many
states
do
use
those
regimes.
now,
justice
kennedy,
i
did
want
to--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes,
it
can,
justice
kennedy,
but
chain
of
custody
is
proved
by
live
witnesses
every
day
in
--
every
day
in
courtrooms
across
the
country--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--long
before
melendez-diaz
or
crawford.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical
correctly,
i
think
that
if
the
defendant
wanted
--
the
defendant
can
certainly
make
that
argument
to
a
jury,
and
the
defendant,
if
he
wanted
to
insist
--
if
the
prosecution
wanted
to
tie
the
results
--
let's
bring
it
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case
--
wanted
to
tie
the.21
to
mr.
bullcoming
by
saying
that
was
mr.
bullcoming's
sample,
then
they'd
need
to
bring
somebody
into
court
if
the
defendant
insisted
upon
it.
but
the
one
thing
i
want
to
add
is
that
the
public
defender
service
brief
makes
clear,
and
the
facts
of
this
case
make
clear,
it's
going
to
be
very
rare
that
a
defendant
wants
to
do
that.
the
defendant
in
this
case
wanted
to
stipulate
to
the
nurse's
blood
draw
and
that
it
was
his
blood
that
was
drawn
in
the
hospital.
it
was
the
state
that
insisted
on
putting
her
on
the
stand.
it
happens
in
courtrooms
all
across
the
country.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
will
gladly
accept
(b)
if
we
want
to
say
that
consequences
are
irrelevant,
because
i
think
that's
what
--
the
sixth
amendment
is
what
it
is,
but
i
think
the
only
thing
i
would
add
is
that
all
i
can
say
is,
empirically,
in
the
states
that
have
followed
the
rule
we
advocate
today,
long
before
crawford
or
melendez-diaz,
it
simply
is
a
manageable
burden.
i'm
not
saying
it's
no
burden.
but
it
is
a
thoroughly
manageable--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
it
was
raised
even
more
pointedly
in
melendez-diaz
when
it
comes
to
lab
analysts.
i
think
in
both
places
the
court,
yes,
set
that
aside.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's
what
melendez-diaz--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
mr.
caylor's
certifications
in
this
--
in
the
lab
report,
not
only
that
the
blood
--
that
the
blood
had
a.21
blood
alcohol
content,
but
also
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--oh,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--and
also
that
it
was
mr.
bullcoming's
blood
sample
and
that
the
sample
had
not
been
tampered
with.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
the
totality
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
want
to
be
clear
that
raw
--
by
"raw
data",
you
mean
the
printout
from
a
machine?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it's
used
a
few
different
ways
in
the
briefing.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
was
neither
--
it
was
not
introduced,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
mr.
razatos
even
reviewed
it.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
so
what
he
did
is
just
read
the
report.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
probably
not.
provided,
as
you
say,
the
chain
of
custody
had
been
either
properly
proved
or
stipulated
to,
i
think
an
expert
could
take
the
stand
and
say,
i'm
looking
at
a
graph,
and
here's
what
the
graph
shows
me.
now,
you
might
get
into--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
i'm
certainly
not
here
today
to
agree
with
the
new
mexico
supreme
court.
what
they
said
doesn't
--
doesn't
make
any
sense
in
this
case
because
(a)
the
printout
was
never
introduced
into
evidence
or
looked
at,
and
(b)
it
would
matter
a
great
deal
--
and
this
is
how
i
continue
my
answer.
it
mattered
a
great
deal
what
was
on
the
printout.
if
the
printout
is
nothing
more
than
a
graph,
then
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that's
a
testimonial
statement.
if
a
printout
comes
out
of
a
machine
that
also
says
at
the
top
blood
sample
was
donald
bullcoming's,
here's
the
test
that
was
run,
et
cetera,
those
may
well
be
testimonial
statements
that
the
analyst
triggered
the
machine
to
spit
out.
so
the
fourth
circuit
has
wrestled
with
this
issue
in
the
washington
case,
and
you
can
--
you
can
look
at
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
in
that
case.
i
think
that
the
question
would
arise
in
that
scenario,
if
the
graphs
were
--
if
the
machine
printouts
were
introduced
into
evidence,
the
question
would
be,
are
the
machine
printouts
testimonial?
and
to
the
extent
they
are,
you'd
have
the
same
problem
in
this
case.
to
the
extent
they
are
not
--
as
the
fourth
circuit
suggested,
at
least
to
some
degree
they
may
not
be
--
then
you
don't
have
a--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--confrontation
clause
problem.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
an
expert
can
look
at
anything.
the
only
question
is
what's
introduced
into
evidence.
there's
no
--
there's
no
confrontation
clause--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--barring
an
expert
from
reviewing
whatever
he
wants.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
in
one
of
two
scenarios,
justice
sotomayor,
the
first
which
is
the
scenario
we
have
in
this
case,
when
the
report
is
introduced
and
it's
testimonial.
the
second--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
second
is
that
it's
not
introduced.
then
you
have
a
confrontation
clause
violation
if
the
expert
--
and
this
is
the
words
many
lower
courts
have
used
--
is
a
mere
conduit
for
introducing
the
out-of-court
testimonial
statement.
so--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
there's
one
other
thing,
justice
alito,
which
is
that
the
sample
had
not
been
tampered
with--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--or
contaminated.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that
would
be
a
question
of
state
law,
justice
alito.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
wouldn't
be
a
confrontation
clause
question.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
alito,
i
think
if
you
look
earlier
in
the
joint
appendix,
i
believe
it's
at
page
40,
where
the
state
for
the
first
time
says
we're
going
to
put
mr.
razatos
on
the
stand
instead
of
mr.
caylor,
there's
a
--
there's
an
objection
there
as
well
that
says
you
can't
then
put
the
document
into
evidence
that
mr.
caylor
wrote
if
he's
not
going
to
be
on
the
stand.
that's
the
critical
objection
here.
now,
you're
right,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
mr.
razatos
having
taken
the
stand
in
this
case,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
him
having
described
typical
procedures
in
the
lab.
i
think
the
objection
you're
pointing
was
to
the
one
that
said
--
again,
as
far
as
the
state
law
objection,
saying
he
can't
testify
to
something
he
doesn't
have
personal
knowledge
about,
which
is
whether
the
procedures
were
followed
in
this
case.
but
mr.
--
mr.
razatos
could
certainly
take
the
stand
and
testify
to
--
to
general
procedures.
but
at
page
54
and
55
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
--
he
simply
reads
the
report's
results.
and
so
you
have
two
confrontation
clause
violations,
really.
you
have
the
report
being
introduced
in
the
first
instance,
and
then
you
have
--
i
believe
it's
at
54
and
55
of
the
joint
appendix.
you
have
the
prosecutor
asking
mr.
razatos,
what
was
the
result?
he
says
the
result
was.21.
as
the
state
itself
says
at
page
58,
note
15
of
its
brief,
there
was
no
independent
analysis
being
applied
there.
all
mr.
razatos
was
doing
was
repeating
and
giving
the
jury
the
conclusions
that
mr.
caylor
had
reached.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if
it
said
nothing
more
than
the.21
coming
out
of
the
machine,
i
think
probably
not.
now,
judge
michael
in
the
first
circuit
would
disagree;
and
so
that's
an
issue
that's
not
in
this
case,
and
i
think
you
could
debate
whether
that
should
--
even
that
should
be
considered
hearsay
of
the
operator.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well
--
well,
the
question
that
would
arise
there
would
be
whether
the.21
should
be
treated
as
mr.
caylor's
statement.
let
me
--
if
i
give
you
two
hypotheticals,
maybe
it
explains.
on
the
one
hand,
i
don't
think
anyone
would
claim
that
a
time
stamp
on
a
fax
machine,
for
example,
is
a
human
statement.
it's
a
machine
statement,
and
so
therefore
it
can't
be
testimonial.
on
the
other
hand,
if
someone
types
out
an
affidavit
on
a
word
processor
and
hits
print,
you
can't
say,
well,
that's
the
machine
talking,
not
the
human.
so
the
question
arises
in
the
lab
context
whether
a.21
or
anything
else
that
comes
out
of
the
machine
has
enough
human
influence
that
it
ought
to
be
treated
as
the
--
as
the
person's
statement.
now,
you
don't
have
to
resolve
that
in
this
case,
and
what's
important
to
emphasize
is
that
that
hypothetical
of
the.21,
even
though
the
state
would
like
it
to
be
this
case,
is
really
miles
away
for
the
reason
you
said,
because
the
state
proved
a
lot
more
than.21
by
mr.
caylor's
lab
report,
and
that's
why
these
hypotheticals
i
think
are
important.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
the
state
could--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
state
could
make
that
choice,
but
it
would
be
a
considerably
weaker
case,
justice
alito,
not
just
because
they
wouldn't
have
anyone
saying
that
the
procedures
were
actually
followed
in
this
case,
but
also
in
this
case
it
would
be
a
far
weaker
case
because
they'd
have
somebody
on
the
stand
who
would
now
be
subject
to
cross-examination
as
to
why
he
had
been
recently
put
on
unpaid
leave.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that
was--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that
was
his
defense,
justice
alito,
and
here's
why
the
lab
report
is
still
important,
though.
because
you're
right,
he
did
admit
he
was
drunk.
but
remember,
he
was
not
convicted
simply
of
dui;
he
was
convicted
in
new
mexico
law
of
aggravated
dui.
and
to
have
aggravated
dui
you
need
to
have
up
to
a.16
blood
alcohol
content.
so
the
report
is
the
only
the
state
could
have
proved
over.16,
even
if
mr.
bullcoming
admitted
that
he
had
been
drinking
that
day.
so
that's
why
it's
important
in
this
case.
that's
why
he
wanted
to
challenge
--
that's
one
reason
why
he
wanted
to
challenge
the
report.
let
me
come
back
to
the
--
to
the
important
point,
i
think,
though,
that
what
the
state
wants
to
be
able
to
do
--
i
don't
want
to
ascribe
a
bad
motive,
but
what
the
state's
rule
would
allow
states
to
do
is
to
insulate
people
from
cross-examination,
not
just
mr.
caylor
in
this
case,
but
--
but
--
but
please
pay
attention
to,
for
example,
the
dungo
case
that's
cited
in
our
opening
brief,
from
california.
that's
a
case
where
a
coroner
had
been
fired
from
his
job,
blacklisted
by
law
enforcement,
and
prohibited
from
testifying
in
many
counties
because
he
falsified
his
reports,
his
autopsy
reports,
by
writing
them
with
the
police
report
sitting
right
next
to
him.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
and--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
we
--
we
could
have,
but
melendez-diaz
makes
clear
that
doesn't
satisfy
the
confrontation
clause.
and
when
you
deal
especially
with
a
garden
variety
dui
case
there
is
only
so
much
time
and
resources
at
issue,
and
that's
why
the
confrontation
clause
i
think
is
especially
important
in
a
case
like
this,
that
the
prosecution
bring
its
witnesses
into
court.
and
if
i
could
just
finish
the
dungo
story,
in
the
--
in
the
california
court
of
appeal,
when
they
reviewed
that
case,
they
said
the
prosecutor's
intent
in
that
case
had
been
to
shield
mr.
--
i'm
sorry,
the
--
the
actual
analyst
in
that
case
from
cross-examination.
and,
in
fact,
the
supervisor
when
he
took
the
stand
at
the
preliminary
hearing
told
--
told
the
court
the
reason
why
they
have
me
here
is
the
prosecutors
find
it
too
hard
to
have
this
person
in
court.
so
that
would
be
perfectly
permissible,
if
--
if
the
state
win
this
case
today
and
surrogate
testimony
were
allowed.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
let
me
give
you
two
answers,
justice
ginsburg,
but
first
let
me
say
we
don't
know
whether
somebody
doesn't
remember
it
until
he's
put
on
the
stand.
what
the
nacdl
brief
says
is
that
even
though
analysts
don't
ordinary
remember
run-of-the-mill
tests
like
this,
that
do
remember
if
something
went
wrong
or
if
something
went
haywire.
so
we
wouldn't
know
that.
but
assuming
you're
right
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
my
understanding,
justice
scalia.
so
that's
another
reason
why
he
may
have
remembered.
but
even
if
he
didn't,
there's
two
things
that
could
be
importantly
probed
here.
one
is
his
credibility.
and
i've
explained
why
that
was
a
very
serious
issue
in
this
case,
because
he
was
put
on
unpaid
leave.
the
other
is
his
competence.
again,
melendez-diaz
says
it's
important
to
have
the
person
on
the
stand
to
explain
how
he
does
his
job,
for
the
jury
to
observe
his
professionalism,
for
him
to
explain
here's
my
understanding
of
these
procedures,
et
cetera.
that
could
be
very
important,
and
if
i
could
leave
you
with
one
thing
before
i--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--of
course,
it
can,
justice
scalia.
and
on
the
flip
side,
even
if
he
doesn't
remember,
cross-examination
is
very
important.
if
i
could
leave
you
with
one
thing
that
i
think
isn't
highlighted
in
the
brief
maybe
the
way
it
should
have
been.
there's
a
line
of
cases
from
this
court,
california
v.
green,
delaware
v.
fensterer,
and
united
states
v.
owens,
that
all
hold
that
if
a
witness
takes
the
stand
and
doesn't
remember
anything,
that
the
confrontation
clause
is
still
--
is
still
satisfied,
as
long
as
that
witness
is
on
the
stand
for
the
reason
justice
scalia
explained
and
because
the
jury
can
observe
them,
et
cetera.
and
so,
the
flip
side
of
that
has
to
be
--
it's
the
holding
of
owens
most
recently
is
that
those
are
meaningful
things
that
the
confrontation
clause
requires.
and
so
the
flip
side
of
those
cases
has
to
be
that
if
the
witness
takes
the
stand
and
doesn't
remember,
the
ineffectiveness
potentially
of
a
cross-examination
there
doesn't
matter,
either.
if
i
could
reserve
what
little
time
i
have
left.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you.
let
me
try
to
make
four
quick
points.
first,
justice
alito,
i
said
the
first
objection
was
at
ja
40,
it's
actually
44-45
in
the
joint
appendix.
with
regard
to
the
state's
argument
about
whether
this
document
is
testimonial,
i
would
simply
urge
the
court
to
take
a
very
close
look
at
the
lab
report
itself.
it's
at
ja
62.
at
the
top
it
says,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
to
your
question,
arresting
officer
identification,
and
the
officer
writes,
check
for
blood
alcohol
concentration.
that's
the
order
to
the
lab.
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
in
the
certification
of
analyst,
he
certifies
that
the
following
is
true
and
correct,
signs
his
name,
and
perhaps
the
most
critical
thing
is
at
the
very
bottom,
the
actual
rules
of
the
new
mexico
evidence
law
and
criminal
procedure
law
are
referenced.
so,
it's
exactly
like
melendez-diaz.
this
is
a
document
that
is
expressly
prepared
for
substitute
live
testimony.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
not
under
oath
if
a
certification
is
actually
different
than
an
oath,
that
just
makes
this
worse,
as
in
crawford
this
court
said
that
it
would
be
implausible
that
trial
by
affidavit
would
be
prohibited
but
trial
by
unsworn
affidavit
would
be
okay.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
they
say
much
the
same
thing.
there
are
--
there
are
several
rules
referenced
at
the
bottom
that
all
make
this
automatically
admissible,
notwithstanding
the
hearsay
rule
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted.
with
respect
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
retesting,
you
are
exactly
right.
the
state
had
many
choices
in
the
case
--
in
this
case
about
how
to
proceed.
but
if
it
wanted
mr.
razatos
to
be
its
witness,
all
it
had
to
do
was
have
him
do
a
--
retest
it
and
write
a
new
report
and
have
him
be
the
witness.
there
is
no
reason
it
would
have
to
introduce
mr.
caylor's
report
then
and
come
up
against
any
state
law
issue.
mr.
razatos
could
have
been
the
live
witness.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
and
i
think
that
--
i'm
sorry.
i
think
that
goes
to
my
last
point,
which
is,
justice
breyer,
you're
talking
about
states
that
do
this
--
i'll
combine
my
answer
to
these
two
things.
a
continuance
would
have
been
perfectly
--
perfectly
appropriate
if
that
scenario
had
arisen,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that's
what
--
one
thing
the
public
--
public
defender
service
brief
it
talks
about
23
--
26
jurisdictions
encompassing
23
different
states
that
follow
the
rule
that
we're
advocating
today.
and
it
--
we're
not
asking
for
more
witnesses.
it's
important
that
we're
--
this
isn't
a
multiple
witness
problem,
we're
just
asking
for
a
different
witness.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
in
other
words,
the
state
just
brought
the
wrong
witness.
thank
you.
