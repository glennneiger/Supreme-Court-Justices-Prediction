justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
police
witnesses?
what
about
not
requiring
the
officer
who
--
who
took
the
confession
or
who
witnessed
the
alleged
crime
--
not
requiring
him
to
appear
because
he's
busy?
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
make
it.
he's
out
on
the
beat.
so
can
we
have
him
appear
by
television?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
is
a
lab
technician
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
takes
its
chances,
right?
i
mean,
as
to
how
much
it
has
to
bring
in,
in
order
to
persuade
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
not
melendez-diaz
also
say
that
if
the
defendant
wants
to
challenge
the
--
the
chain
of
custody,
the
state
can
adopt
rules
that
requires
the
defendant
to
assert
that
challenge
or
his
intention
to
make
that
challenge,
or
his
intention
to
make
that
challenge,
prior
to
the
trial
so
that
the
state
will
know
whether
it
has
to
introduce
any
live
testimony?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fisher,
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
court
put
this
worry
behind
us
in
crawford.
wasn't
the
same
worry
raised
in
crawford?
justice
antonin
scalia
said,
yes,
it
may
be
something
of
a
risk,
but
the
states
have
managed
it
in
the
past,
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
they
can't
manage
it
in
the
future.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
it
the
case
that
these
tests
are
unusual
in
this
particular
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
assume
that
even
if
he
doesn't
remember,
his
testimony
is
not
worthless
to
the
prosecution.
he
--
the
prosecution
can
bring
out
his
high
qualifications,
and
he
can
testify:
it
--
this
is
always
the
way
i
do
it.
i
do
it
this
way
all
the
time.
i
don't
remember
this
particular
incident.
all
of
that
can
be
persuasive
to
the
jury,
can't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
you
mean
so
long
as
all
--
all
hearsay
by
non-police
officers
can
be
admitted
without,
without
confrontation,
just
because
they're
not
police
officers?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
that
was
your
point,
because
it's
certainly
not
true,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
was
prepared
just
for
fun,
not
for
use
in
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
statute
requires
it
to
be
taken
to
be
used
at
trial
or
whether
the
police
send
it
over
to
be
used
at
trial
as
a
use
of
the
state?
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
analyst
was
fired,
as
i
recall.
was
he
fired,
placed
on
administrative
leave
or
something?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
leave
without
pay?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
do
we
know
why
it
was
leave
without
pay?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
defense
know
why
it
was
leave
without
pay?
could
the
defense
have
found
out
in
cross-examination
that
the
reason
he
was
leave
without
pay
because
he
was
--
had
shown
himself
to
be
incompetent,
and
they
were
in
the
process
of
firing
him?
i
don't
know
whether
that's
true,
but
wouldn't
that
be
important
to
the
defense?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
didn't
--
and
didn't
the
prosecution
intentionally
set
it
up
this
way
so
that
this
person
would
not
have
to
testify,
so
that
he
could
not
be
cross-examined?
isn't
that
why
they
sent
the
substitute
to
testify?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
the
facts
are,
but
boy,
it
smells
bad
to
me.
it
really
does.
and
even
if
that
was
not
the
case,
the
mere
possibility
that
it
could
have
been
the
case
shows
why
you
should
have
to
bring
this
person
in
if
you
want
to
introduce
his
testimony.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
that
whether
it's
testimonial
does
not
depend
upon
whether
there's
skullduggery
or
not,
but
the
possibility
of
skullduggery,
even
in
machine
--
machine
situations
such
as
this,
is
a
good
reason
for
saying
this
is
testimonial.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
not
the
same
information.
one
would
say
the
police
submitted
it
and
the
other
one
would
say
the
defendant
submitted
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
the
police
submitted
it,
the
--
the
person
doing
the
--
the
test
would
know
that
the
police
submitted
it,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
a
key
question
whether
this
was
an
interrogation?
does
the
confrontation
clause
apply
only
to
confrontations?
to
interrogations?
i
mean,
if
a
--
if
a
witness,
before
the
police
ask
any
questions,
blurts
out,
you
know,
"jones
did
it",
can
that
statement
get
in
because
it
has
not
been
in
response
to
an
interrogation?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
different
because
interrogation
doesn't
make
any
difference.
that
is
not
the
condition
for
the
application
of
the
--
of
the
confrontation
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
were
an
interrogation,
the
factors
mentioned
in
michigan
v.
bryant
would
be
relevant,
presumably,
but
since
this
wasn't
an
interrogation,
i
don't
see
how
that
has
any
--
any
relevance
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he'd
look
at
the
report
and
say,
gee,
i
don't
remember;
you
know,
i
do
a
lot
of
these
reports.
but
then
the
prosecution
in
direct
would
say,
well,
how
do
you
do
them?
and
he
would
say,
i
always
do
this,
i
always
do
that,
i
always
do
the
other
thing.
did
you
do
it
in
this
case?
well,
i
don't
specifically
remember
this
case,
but
i
always
do
it.
and
that's
the
testimony
that
would
go
to
the
jury.
it
would
be
pretty
persuasive.
not
as
good
as
if
he
did
remember.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
chain
of
custody
wasn't
--
wasn't
contested
here,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
often
contested?
my
impression
is
it's
not
very
often
contested.
justice
antonin
scalia
general,
i
know
your
state
takes
a
different
view
of
it
or
you
wouldn't
be
here,
but
aren't
there
are
a
number
of
states
that
--
that
do
provide
the
testimony
of
the
technician,
who
do
require
the
technician
to
come
in
and
--
and
testify?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
have
they
had,
to
your
knowledge,
serious
problems
about
defendants
contesting
chain
of
custody
simply
because
this
other
thing
is
required?
again,
i'm
--
i'm
not
aware
that
that's
been
a
problem.
i
think
it's
a
boogeyman.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
an
accurate
response,
at
least
if
you
include
the
qualification
that
justice
breyer
put
in
the
question,
which
is
that
the
records
were
kept
with
the
knowledge
that
they
would
be
introduced
in
--
in
criminal
trials.
i
mean,
you
can
say
that
all
the
records
of
labs
--
let's
assume
there's
a
--
there's
a
police
lab
which
--
which
only
does
police
testing
of
blood.
those
would
be
business
records
of
the
lab,
but
they
certainly
would
not
be
introducible
just
because
they're
business
records.
if
the
record
is
made
for
the
use
in
prosecution,
surely
it's
--
it
doesn't
come
under
the
business
records
exception,
or
else
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
independent
lab
and
police
always
send
it
to
this
independent
lab,
but
in
fact
it's
an
independent
business,
it
makes
a
profit;
but
all
the
stuff
it
does
it
knows
is
going
to
be
used
at
trial.
that
wouldn't
be
admissible,
would
it?
even
though
it's
a
perfectly
normal
business
record.
justice
antonin
scalia
general,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
eat
up
your
--
your
little
remaining
time,
i
think
you
can
answer
yes
or
no.
does
new
mexico
assert
the
same
rule
as
applicable
to
ballistics
testing?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
--
you
--
you
think
the
result
would
be
a
--
the
same
if
we
could
develop
a
machine
that
you
put
the
bullet
in
and
--
and
--
and
--
that's
been
fired
from
this
gun,
and
the
murder
bullet,
and
the
machine
goes,
blah,
blah,
blah,
and
it
spits
out,
you
know,
99
percent,
99.9
percent
match,
that
would
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
under
oath,
though,
that's
the
only
difference?
