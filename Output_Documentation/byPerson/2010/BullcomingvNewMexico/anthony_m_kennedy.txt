justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
don't
understand
that.
how
is
that
any
different
than
the
supervisor
of
the
lab
saying,
i
know
what
these
people
do,
i
--
i
watch
them
on
a
day-to-day
basis,
and
they
perform
their
work
correctly?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
the
state
wanted
to
introduce
is
the
result
of
the
exam,
and
the
chief
justice
gives
you
the
hypothetical.
say,
two
people
are
necessary
for
the
exam.
you
say
only
one
has
to
be
there
if
both
saw
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
--
but
it's
hearsay
as
to
what
the
first
person
did
with
--
with
crimping--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--crimping
the
thing.
it's
not
direct
testimony
from
that
person.
you
didn't
say,
are
you
experienced
in
crimping?
did
you
use
your
right
hand
or
your
left
hand?
is
there
a
danger
of
spillage?
and
so
on.
all
that
is
beyond
the
ability
of
the
defense
to
ask.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
always
take
your
chances
with
a
business
record.
that's
a
given,
of
course.
of
course,
the
state
takes
a
chance
with
the
--
with
the
admission
of
any
admissible
hearsay
testimony
that
the
jury
will
be
--
that
you'll
make
the
argument
to
the
jury
that
you
should
discount
it
if
the
person
isn't
there.
that's
always
true.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
i
take
it
it's
a
testimonial
statement
that
this
blood
that
was
taken
at
the
hospital
was
the
blood
of
the
defendant.
that's
a
testimonial
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
i
assume
that
in
this
case,
the
nurse
and
the
police
officer
were
both
present.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
assume
under
your
position,
you
could
not
have
a
record
showing
that
the
--
the
nurse
withdrew
the
sample
at
10:08
p.m.
on
such-and-such
a
date
and
that
she
followed
the
regular
procedure.
that
would
be
insufficient
if
the
state
wanted
to
introduce
just
a
certificate
or
just
--
just
that
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
does
--
it
does
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
chain
--
the
chain
of
custody
does
involve
a
testimonial
statement
that
this
is
the
blood,
that
i
took
it
out
at
10:05
p.m.
on
saturday
evening.
that's
a
testimonial
statement.
it's
the
defendant's
blood.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
you
want
to
tell
us,
don't
worry,
it
won't
happen,
i
think
that's
an
unacceptable
argument.
you're
saying
the
defense
has
certain
rights,
and
we
have
to
presume
there
is
a
defense
attorney
who's
going
to
afford
his
client
every
right
the
constitution
has.
so
the
fact
that
we're
not
supposed
to
worry
because
it
won't
happen
very
often
is
(a)
it
seems
to
me,
an
unlikely
hypothetical;
and
(b)
it
seems
to
me,
irrelevant
to
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
say
that
this
court
holds
that
the
confrontation
clause
requires
the
presence
of
the
actual
analyst
to
testify
about
the
sample.
is
there
anything
in
the
law
that
says
that
that
testimony
is
suddenly
excused,
and
you
do
not
need
the
analyst
if
there's
another
sample
available
for
the
defendant
to
test?
that's
not
the
rule,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
saying
that
analytically
that
does
not
bear
on
the
question
whether
or
not
the
sample
that's
introduced
by
the
state
requires
the
--
the
analyst
to
be
present.
they're
just
unrelated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
may
--
that
may
show
that
the
confrontation
rule
is
a
silly
rule.
but
it
doesn't
--
but
it
--
there's
--
assuming
confrontation
is
required,
it's
not
excused--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--by
the
presence
of
another
sample.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
the
rules
of
criminal
--
do
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
in
new
mexico
say
it
should
be
prima
facie
evidence?
