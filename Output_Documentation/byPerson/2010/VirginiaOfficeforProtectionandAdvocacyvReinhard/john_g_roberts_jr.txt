chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-529,
the
virginia
office
for
protection
and
advocacy
v.
stewart.
mr.
galanter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
this
were
a
private
suit,
let's
say
ford
motor
company
has
two
subsidiaries,
ford
east
and
ford
west,
they
get
into
a
dispute.
ford
west
sues
ford
east.
no
federal
court
would
entertain
that
action,
would
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
they
think
--
ford
west
thinks
ford
east
is
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
race.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
adversely
affects
their
reputation,
too,
so
they
sue
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
independent
--
it
is
independent
from
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
is
it
independent
from
the
state?
is
that
what
the
statute
says?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
on
page
27
of
your
brief,
the
blue
brief,
that
there
is
no
big
deal
here
with
respect
to
state
sovereignty
because
ultimately
the
sovereign
retains
the
authority
to
dissolve
the
state
agency
plaintiff
if
the
state
believes
the
litigation
is
too
onerous.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
good
cite
for
your
proposition,
but
arguably
in
those
cases
the
icc
is
really
not
the
real
party
in
interest.
the
real
party
in
interest
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
icc
ruling.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
get
back
to
my
question,
no
court
would
entertain
ford
west
against
ford
east?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
divisions;
separate
corporate
entities
that
happened
to
be
wholly
owned
by
the
same
parent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
would
become
an
advisory
opinion.
ford
has
an
internal
dispute,
basically,
and
in
that
hypothetical
one
of
the
entities
would
be
asking
the
federal
court
to
resolve
it.
ford
can
decide
at
the
end
of
the
day
how
it
wants
to
resolve
it.
if
ford
west
wins
and
ford
east
loses,
ford
can
say,
all
right,
this
is
how
we
are
going
to
do
it
regardless
of
what
the
federal
court
says.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
state
here
is
free
to
dissolve
one
of
the
parties
to
the
case.
that's
a
little
different.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right,
state,
commonwealth.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
right,
but
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
because
they
made
the
choice
of
saying
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
us,
the
state.
and
as
far
as
what
issue
is
before
the
court,
i
would
suppose
the
article
iii
question
is
a
jurisdictional
one
that
we
have
to
address
before
reaching
the
eleventh
amendment
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
--
i
know
you
are
anxious
to
get
to
that,
but--
[laughter]
--do
you
know
--
do
you
know
of
any
other
situation
where
one
party
in
a
federal
court
action
can
dissolve
the
other
one
in
the
middle
of
the
case?
i
mean,
if
vopa
files
a
discovery
request
with
the
state
and
they
think
it
is,
as
you
put
it
in
your
brief,
too
onerous,
the
state
can
say:
guess
what,
the
case
is
over,
you
are
dissolved.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
anders.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
epa
sue
the
army
corps
of
engineers
for
violating
the
clean
water
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
very
adverse.
epa
wants
clean
water
and
the
army
corps
of
engineers
wants
to,
you
know,
dredge
the
water
in
a
way
that
contributes
to
pollution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
virginia
can
dissolve
vopa
if
it
finds
the
litigation
too
onerous?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it
happened
to
arise,
do
you
think
that
they
can
--
do
you
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
they
can
do
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
sure
that
the
governor
cannot
remove
the
members
of
vopa?
i
know
it
says
vopa
has
to
be
independent
of
any
state
agency
and
the
governor
appoints
one-third.
can
the
governor
remove
the
members
of
this
virginia
agency?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
would
it
not
comply
with?
i
just
don't
know.
i'm
just
looking
at
the
provision
where
you
say
it's
independent
and
it
says
independent
of
any
state
agency.
you
said
the
governor
may
not
appoint
more
than
one-third.
i
just
wonder
if
there
is
a
prohibition
on
him
removing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
vopa
officials
are
engaged
in
corruption
or
illegal
conduct
or,
you
know,
extracurricular
activity
that
brings
discredit
upon
the
--
the
governor
has
no
power
to
say
that,
you
are
a
virginia
official
and
you
are
--
you
know,
whatever
--
breaking
virginia
law,
for
example?
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
anderson.
mr.
getchell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
think
so
--
what?
you
don't
think
congress--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
galanter,
have
you
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel,
i
have
one
question
of
curiosity.
you
said
in
your
opening
argument
that
49
of
50
states
limit
in
some
way
the
executive's
power
in
this
area.
what's
the
one
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
