ms.
ginger
d.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
vopa
has
properly
invoked
ex
parte
young
to
enforce
respondent's
obligation
under
the
dd
and
paimia
acts
here,
because
vopa's
complaint
satisfies
the
straightforward
inquiries
set
forth
in
verizon.
we
don't
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
go
into
state
sovereignty
interests
to
determine
whether
ex
parte
young
should
be
allowed
here,
but
even
if
the
court
were
to
do
that,
i
think
it
is
unquestionable
that
there
are
no
state
sovereignty
interests
here.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
it
does,
so
long
as
that
requirement
is
reasonably
related
to
the
government's
interest
in
the
funds
and
in
--
in
the
objective
of
its
regulation.
now--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
it
could
do
that,
so
long
as
that's
not
independently
unconstitutional.
i
think
the
state
always
has
the
opportunity
to
decide
not
to
opt
into
the
scheme,
and
i
think
that's
very
important
here
because
the
sole
aspect
of
this
suit
that
virginia
challenges,
which
is
the
fact
that
vopa
is
a
state
agency,
is
the
result
of
two
sovereign
choices
that
the
state
made
here.
the
first
choice
was
to
opt
to
the
dd
and
paimia
programs,
to
take
the
federal
funds,
to
create
a
p
and
a
system
that
has
federal
rights
of
access
to
which
both
state
and
private
facilities
are
subject.
and
the
second
choice
that
virginia
made
was
to
establish
a
state
agency
p
and
a
system
here.
it
could
have
established
a
private
agency
if
it
were
concerned
about--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--that's
correct.
there
are
eight
public
p
and
a
systems.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
i
think
you
would
have
an
article
3
problem
if
there
isn't
sufficient
adversity.
if
the--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
they're
both
--
the
heads
of
both
agencies
are,
in
that
situation,
i
think,
subject
to
removal
by
the
same
people,
and
so
in
that
situation,
you
would
have
an
article
3
problem.
but
we
don't
have
that
problem
here,
because
vopa
is
independent
under
state
law.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
that
that
would
not
happen
in
practice,
because
if
virginia
were
to
dissolve
vopa,
it
would
be
out
of
compliance
with
the
federal
scheme
so
it
would
lose
its
--
it
would
lose
its
federal
funding
at
that
point.
so
i
don't
think
that
is
a
situation
that
is
going
to
arise,
but--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
they
--
i
think
they
could
do
it,
but
i
think
this
--
this
court
has
previously
adjudicated
cases
where,
in
theory,
the
government
could
have
changed
the
case
mid-stream.
u.s.
v.
nixon
is
an
example
of
that.
the
icc
case
as
well,
and
i
think
also
in
the
lassen
case,
this
court
said
that
it
could
adjudicate
a
suit
between
two
state
agencies
because
the
agencies
were
sufficiently
independent
from
each
other.
they
weren't
subject
to
removal
by
the
same
head
of
government.
so
i
think,
while
you
might
have
an
article
3
problem
in
some
situations,
you
don't
have
that
problem
here
because
of
vopa's
independence.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
there
are
several.
i
think,
first,
you
would
have
to
have
a
federal
right
that
the
ag
would
be
able
to
enforce.
he
would
have
to
have
a
way
to
get
into
federal
court.
he
would
have
to
have
a
theory
of
standing,
and
i
think
this
is
not
a
situation
that
has
arisen
at
this
point.
there
are
no
examples
of
this.
and
so
i
think--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--if
that
was
sufficient
to
get
into
federal
court
for
article
3
purposes,
i
think
there
might
be
some
situations
in
which
the
attorney
general--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--there
may
be
some
circumstances
like
that
one,
in
which
the
state
ag's
use
of
ex
parte
young
would
raise
special
sovereignty
interests
that
would
counsel
against--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
he
could
under
this
court's
decision
in
verizon.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
there
might
be
certain
extreme
circumstances
where--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--right,
and
as
this
court
said
in
lassen,
i
think
often
the
federal
court
doesn't
look
behind
state
officers--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
same
special
sovereignty
interests
are
not
present
here,
because
under
the
spending
clause,
virginia
had
the
choice
to
opt
into
this
scheme.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
i
don't
think
he
can.
and
if
he
were
to
try
to
do
that,
that
would
be
a
compliance
problem
from
hhs's
perspective,
and
so
virginia
might
at
that
point--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
there
is
definitely
a
prohibition
on
him
removing
board
members
of
vopa
or
officials
of
vopa
as
a
result
of
vopa's
actions
in
litigation.
i
think--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
the
provision
--
well,
the
requirement
that
vopa
have
full
authority
to
pursue
legal
remedies
to
ensure
the
protection
of
individuals.
this
is
on
page
52a
of
the
petition
appendix.
that's
the
paimia
law.
and
i
think
that
actually
did
happen
in
virginia,
that
hhs
came
in--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
under
virginia
law
i
think
that
vopa's
officials
are
subject
to
for-cause
removal
provisions.
so
they
can
actually
be
removed
judicially
through
for-cause
proceedings.
and
from
our
perspective
that
is
consistent
with
vopa's
independence
and
it's
full
authority
to
pursue
remedies
because
that
type
of
for-cause
removal
wouldn't
be
on
the
basis
of
vopa's
actions
in
litigation.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
that's
right,
that
under
verizon
no
more
is
required.
vopa
has
a
federal
right
here.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
verizon
was
a
private
party.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
i
think
that
you
might
have
state
sovereignty
interests
at
that
point.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
that
would
prevent
a
federal
court
from
adjudicating
a
suit,
but
there's
no
question
that
those
interests
aren't
present
here
because
virginia
has
chosen
to
create
a
state
agency
in
order
to
enforce
these
federal
rights.
