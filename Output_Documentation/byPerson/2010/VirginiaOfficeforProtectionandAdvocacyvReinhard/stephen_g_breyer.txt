justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
--
this
i'm
confused
about.
i
would
think
you
would
have
to
have
a
state
which
has
a
law
that
permits
the
attorney
general
to
sue
the
governor.
wouldn't
you?
i
mean,
if
the
state
law
is
the
attorney
general
can't
sue
the
governor,
that's
the
end
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
suppose
the
state's
law
is
the
governor
of
the
state
cannot
bring
a
lawsuit
against
the
attorney
general,
and
vice
versa.
okay?
that's
the
state
law.
now,
under
those
circumstances
can
either
bring
a
lawsuit
on
a
federal
right
in
a
federal
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
just
a
yes
or
no
answer.
in
your
opinion,
can
an
attorney
general
where
the
state
law
says,
black
letter
law,
attorney
general
can
never
sue
the
governor;
he's
fired
instantly
if
he
tries
--
that's
the
law
in
this
state,
okay?
now,
can
that
individual
come
into
federal
court
and
sue
on
an
ex
parte
young
theory
suing
the
governor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
could?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
--
i
think
that
is
a
problem.
isn't
that
what
we
are
saying
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
--
suppose
i
am
right
about
this
and
you
can't
do
it.
you
can't.
you
can't
--
the
federal
government
cannot
tell
a
state
how
to
organize
itself.
if
it
wants
to
have
an
attorney
general
that
can
never
bring
a
lawsuit,
that's
up
to
the
state,
unless
it's
a
due
process
problem.
now,
suppose
i
believe
that.
now,
do
you
lose
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suing
in
his
capacity
as
attorney
general
and
under
his.
that's
the
plaintiff,
not
the
defendant.
and
he
has
no
right
to
bring
that
suit,
because
--
it's
not
that
he
doesn't
have
a
right.
it's
that
he
doesn't
have
authority.
he's
not
a
person
that
can
do
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
right,
exactly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
with
justice
scalia
on
this.
i
will
pass
to
the
other
side.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
have
a
state
which
loves
litigation.
48
percent
of
the
population
are
retired
lawyers.
nothing
pleases
them
more
than
to
have
everybody
suing
everybody
else.
so
they
pass
a
statute
which
says,
for
purposes
of
lawsuits
in
this
state,
every
department
can
sue
every
other
department.
now,
if
you
have
such
a
state,
what
in
the
constitution
stops
the
federal
government
from
abiding
by
that
rule
and
applying
ordinary
ex
parte
young
rules,
looking
at
the
defendant,
looking
at
horizon,
and
then
if
the
plaintiff
happens
to
be
a
federal
agency
suing
another,
say,
well,
if
it
complies
with
those
first
set,
the
fact
that
a
sues
b
and
they
are
both
state
agencies,
that's
the
state's
decision.
what
in
the
constitution
can
prevent
the
state
from
deciding
to
organize
what
we'll
call
the
legal
heaven
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
that's
a,
we
can
go
into
a
later
because
i
agree
that
would
be
an
answer,
if
it's
correct.
if
that
is
what
happened,
that's
a
different
question,
whether
congress
could
restructure
the
state.
that's
a
serious
question.
my
question
was
on
the
first.
can
congress
stop
the
state
from
restructuring
itself?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
wrote
it
down
specifically
in
the
law
and
said
we
would
love
to
have
our
agencies
sue
each
other.
they
don't
say
federal
court.
they
just
say
we
love
to
have
our
agencies
sue
each
other.
they
don't
mention
the
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
because
what's
undignified
about
allowing
the
state
to
live
with
the
choice
it
made?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
hypothetical
--
justice
sotomayor
is
totally
right.
i
am
talking
about
ex
parte
young.
i
am
imagining.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
imagining
a
system
where
the
state
wants
to
let
the
ag,
this
organization,
the
sheriff
of
middlesex
county,
the
city
of
san
francisco,
they
want
to
permit
such
entities
to
become
plaintiffs
against
other
parts
of
the
state
government
in
such
a
state
if
ordinary
ex
parte
young
requirements
are
met.
what
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
prohibits
that
suit
from
going
ahead?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
isn't
that
ex
parte
young
--
if
i
understand
this
right,
which
is
why
i
mention
it
--
it
isn't
that
ex
parte
young
permits
one
part
of
a
state
to
sue
another
part,
it
is
a
state
permits
one
part
of
the
state
to
sue
another
part,
that
that's
common
in
the
state,
that
the
law
requires
it,
and
the
question
is,
in
that
circumstance
should
the
ex
parte
young
situation
be
treated
differently?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
about
the
statement
of
the
question
in
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
experience,
this
would
be
helpful.
would
you
characterize
as
common
or
uncommon
situations
where
state
agencies
are
given
authority
to
sue
other
parts
of
the
state?
as
i
think
it
to
myself,
i
think,
well,
the
city
of
glendale
v.
state
water
authority,
or
middlesex
county
sheriff
v.
the
bureau
of
prisons.
that
doesn't
sound
weird
to
me.
it
sounds
as
if
there
probably
are
a
lot
of
such
circumstances,
but
i
don't
know.
what
--
what
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
cities
against
--
they
must
do
that
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
university
of
massachusetts
v.
state
environmental
organization.
does
that
kind
of
suit
sound
familiar
to
you
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
now,
explain
to
me
--
this
is
good,
because
that's
very
helpful
to
me.
it's
the
exact
statement
that
justice
scalia
made,
and
you
said,
yes,
that's
exactly
right.
and
then
it
is
the
case
of
that
a
citizen
of
the
state
can
come
into
the
federal
court
and
sue
the
state
official
under
ex
parte
young,
but
you
say,
but
the
agency
of
the
state
can't
do
it,
even
though
they
have
state
litigating
authority.
and
the
reason
that
the
latter
is
more
injurious
of
the
dignity
interests
of
the
state
than
the
former
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
found
any
case,
are
there
a
lot,
a
few,
none,
where
one
state
agency
at
a
state
level
sues
another
in
federal
court,
period?
say
they
have
a
rising
under
jurisdiction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
are
there
any?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
none?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
nagging
at
me
is
some
kind
of
article
iii
problem.
maybe
there
is
none.
i
don't
know.
there
are
none,
though?
none?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
wouldn't
have
to.
they
could
get
into
all
kinds
of
arguments
about
epa
and
all
kinds
of
federal
rights
with
each
other.
i
would
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
