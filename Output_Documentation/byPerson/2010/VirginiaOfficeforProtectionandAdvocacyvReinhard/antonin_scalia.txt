justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
assume,
and
--
and
i'm
not
sure
what
the
situation
is
in
--
in
the
commonwealth.
we
have
held
that
the
states
don't
have
to
have
the
same
notion
of
separation
of
powers
that
the
federal
government
does.
in
the
federal
government
we
allow
independent
regulatory
agencies
separate
from
the
president.
let's
assume
that
virginia
has
a
system
in
which
the
governor
is
indeed
in
charge
of
the
entire
--
the
entire
executive
branch.
do
you
know
whether
that's
the
case?
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
if
it
were,
and
if
congress
offered
money
to
the
state
and
the
only
way
the
state
could
get
it
would
be
to
abandon
its
system
of
separation
of
powers
and
to
allow
an
agency
of
the
state
which
would
normally
be
under
the
direction
of
the
governor
to
go
riding
off
on
its
own
and
--
and
sue
the
governor,
do
you
think
there
wouldn't
be
any
--
any
problem
about
--
about
the
federal
government
doing
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
requiring
the
state
to
in
effect
alter
its
--
its
governmental
structure
in
order
to
obtain
the
federal
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
got
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
in
nixon
v.
united
states
the
president
could
have
dismissed
the
attorney
general,
but
we
allowed
the
suit
to
go
forward.
i
never
did
understand
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that
can't
be.
how
can
that
be?
he
has
no
power
as
attorney
general
to
do
that.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
ex
parte
young.
it
has
to
do
with
his
powers
as
attorney
general.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
lost
you.
i
thought
ex
parte
young
applied
to
defendants?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
ex
parte
young
allows
--
allows
an
attorney
general
to
sue
as
a
plaintiff
in
his
personal
capacity.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
dignified
sovereign
should
not
agree
to
the
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
the
commonwealth
had
the
choice.
it
had
two
choices,
as
counsel
for
the
government
said.
it
could
either
turn
down
the
money
or,
if
it's
not
dignified
enough
to
do
that,
it
could
take
the
money
and
establish
a
private
organization
to
do
this
work
instead
of
a
state
agency.
so
what,
you
know,
what
complaint
do
you
have
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
is
it
an
extension?
i
mean
--
i
have
sort
of
a
bit
of
a
problem
with
that.
why
is
it
somehow
a
--
a
greater
infringement
upon
a
state
sovereignty
to
allow
a
state
to
be
sued
in
federal
court
by
a
private
individual,
who
doesn't
even
have
to
be
a
virginian,
for
pete's
sake,
he
could
be
from
anywhere,
he
could
be
from
iowa.
and
yet
it
somehow
offends
state
sovereignty
more
when
--
when
you
allow
a
state
agency
to
sue
a
state?
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
why
that
is
so
horribly
worse,
unless
you
are
arguing
that
--
that
it
somehow
destroys
the
state
system
of
separation
of
powers.
but
that's
a
different
question
and
--
and
the
answer
to
that
is
simply,
you
did
it
yourself.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
that
has
independent
litigating
authority.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
mean,
that's
the
difference
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
agency
was
given
independent
litigating
authority.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
argument
is
really
--
really
is
a
sovereign
immunity
argument.
you
are
saying
that
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
unless
it
explicitly
includes
a
waiver
to
be
sued
in
federal
courts,
applies
only
in
state
courts
--
okay
--
and
that
that
limitation
should
not
be
evaded
by
applying
ex
parte
young
to
a
suit
in
federal
court
where
the
suit
is
by
another
state
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
sovereign
immunity
is
part
of
your
argument,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you
would
acknowledge
that
if
the
state
knew
when
it
took
the
money
that
it
was
--
and
when
it
created
a
state
agency
to
administer
the
program
that
it
was
letting
itself
open
to
suit
in
federal
court
under
an
ex
parte
young
theory,
then
everything
would
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
a
waiver
of
whatever
sovereignty
immunity
interest
it
would
have,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
could,
but
if
they
knew
it
in
this
instance
when
they
accepted
the
money,
you
wouldn't
have
a
case,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
good
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
two
federal
statutes,
the
development
disabilities
assistance
and
bill
of
rights
act
of
2000
and
the
protection
and
advocacy
for
individuals
with
mental
illness
act
offer
states
federal
money
to
improve
services
for
individuals
with
developmental
disabilities
and
mental
illness.
as
a
condition
of
receiving
that
funding,
a
state
must
establish
a
protection
and
advocacy
or
a
p&a
system
“to
protect
and
advocate
the
rights”
of
those
people.
a
p&a
system
must
have
authority
to
investigate
incidence
of
abuse
and
neglect
to
obtain
all
records
relevant
to
such
an
investigation
and
to
“pursue
legal
administrative
another
appropriate
remedies
or
approaches
to
ensure
the
protection
of”
its
charges.
virginia
is
one
just
eight
states
to
have
designated
a
state
agency
as
its
p&a
system,
something
federal
law
allows,
provided
the
agency
has
certain
structural
features
that
ensure
its
independence
from
state
government.
the
virginia
office
for
protection
and
advocacy
or
vopa
has
those
required
features
the
governor
of
virginia
appoints
fewer
than
one-third
of
its
governing
board
and
virginia
law
gives
it
freedom
to
litigate
without
oversight
from
the
executive.
vopa
filed
this
lawsuit
after
two
patients
died
and
a
third
was
injured
in
state-run
mental
hospitals.
the
defendant's
respondents
here
are
state
officials
in
charge
of
the
relevant
facilities.
the
suit
claims
that
vopa
has
a
federal
right
to
obtain
access
to
certain
records
relating
to
those
patients
and
it
seeks
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
commanding
respondents
to
produce
those
records.
respondents
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
action
on
eleventh
amendment
sovereign
immunity
grounds.
but
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
suit
was
authorized
by
our
decision
in
the
case
called
ex
parte
young,
which
says
that
a
suit
for
prospective
relief
against
state
officers
for
violation
of
federal
law
is
not
a
suit
against
the
state.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
concluded
that
ex
parte
young
did
not
apply
to
vopa's
suit
because
it
is
a
contest
between
two
state
agencies,
the
adjudication
of
which
in
federal
court
would
offend
virginia's
sovereignty.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
the
eleventh
amendment
confirms
that
states
enter
the
union
with
their
sovereign
immunity
intact.
that
immunity
protects
the
sovereign
from
being
sued
without
its
consent.
a
state
may
waive
its
sovereign
immunity
at
its
pleasure.
and
in
some
cases,
congress
may
abrogate
it
by
appropriate
legislation,
but
otherwise,
federal
courts
may
not
entertain
a
private
person
suit
against
the
state.
that
case
--
but
in
ex
parte
young,
we
adopted
an
important
limit
on
state
sovereign
immunity.
that
case
established
the
principle,
less
delicately
called
a
fiction
that
when
a
federal
court
commands
a
state
official
to
do
nothing
more
than
refrain
from
violating
federal
law,
that
officer
is
not
the
state
for
sovereign
immunity
purposes.
we
conclude
that
entertaining
vopa's
action
is
consistent
with
that
doctrine.
in
verizon
maryland
incorporated
versus
public
service
commission
of
maryland,
we
held
that
“in
determining
whether
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
avoids
an
eleventh
amendment
barred
suit,
a
court
need
only
to
conduct
a
straightforward
inquiry
into
whether
the
complaint
seeks
relief
properly
characterized
as
prospective.”
there
is
no
doubt
vopa's
suit
satisfies
that
straightforward
inquiry.
it
alleges
that
respondent's
refusal
to
produce
the
requested
records
violates
federal
law
and
it
seeks
a
prospective
injunction
requiring
the
production
of
those
records.
although
respondents
contend
that
vopa's
status
as
a
state
agency
alters
the
calculus.
there
is
no
warrant
in
our
cases
for
making
the
validity
of
ex
parte
young
of
an
ex
parte
young
action
turned
upon
the
identity
of
the
plaintiff.
we
have
indeed
made
exceptions
to
ex
parte
young
but
only
on
the
basis
of
“the
effect
of
the
relief
sought.”
for
example,
where
a
suit
seeks
to
compel
a
state
officer
to
disperse
funds
from
the
state
treasury,
the
effect
of
vopa's
requested
relief
concededly
is
permissible
since
even
respondent's
agree
that
that
relief
could
be
obtained
by
a
private
party.
respondents
contend
that
entertaining
vopa's
lawsuit
would
nevertheless
infringe
virginia's
sovereign
interest
because
it
diminishes
the
dignity
of
a
state
to
have
a
federal
court
adjudicate
a
dispute
between
its
components.
we
do
not
agree
at
the
outset,
we
doubt
that
a
state
statute
is
--
that
a
state's
stature
is
diminished
to
any
greater
degree
when
its
own
agency
polices
its
officer's
compliance
with
federal
law
than
when
a
private
person
hails
those
officers
into
federal
court
for
the
same
purpose.
something
everyone
agrees
is
proper.
and
in
this
case,
vopa's
power
to
sue
state
officials
is
a
consequence
of
virginia's
own
decision
to
establish
a
public
rather
than
a
private
p&a
system.
we
failed
to
perceive
what
indignity
is
visited
on
the
commonwealth
when
by
the
operation
of
its
own
laws,
vopa
is
admitted
to
federal
court
as
a
plaintiff.
it
is
also
argued
that
this
lawsuit
offends
sovereign
immunity
because
it
divides
virginia
against
itself.
but
that
is
not
a
distinctive
consequence
of
letting
the
suit
proceed
in
federal
court
under
ex
parte
young.
the
same
result
would
follow
if
the
matter
were
heard
in
state
court.
and
since
this
court
could
still
review
the
federal
question
at
the
behest
of
the
state
court
loser,
the
plan
would
not
even
avoid
the
prospect
of
federal
judges
resolving
vopa's
dispute
with
the
respondents.
we
have
no
occasion
to
pass
on
any
other
questions
of
federalism
lurking
in
this
case
such
as
whether
the
underlying
federal
statutes
are
a
proper
exercise
of
congress'
enumerated
powers.
we
do
not
doubt
of
course
that
there
are
limits
on
the
federal
government's
power
to
affect
the
internal
operations
of
a
state.
it
may
not
commandeer
a
state's
officers
for
example
or
dictate
her
capital,
but
those
limits
must
be
found
in
some
textural
--
textural
provision
or
structural
premise
of
the
constitution.
additional
limits
cannot
be
smuggled
in
under
the
eleventh
amendment
by
barring
a
suit
in
federal
court
that
does
not
violate
the
state's
sovereign
immunity.
finally,
we
acknowledge
that
this
lawsuit
between
two
state
agencies
in
federal
court
is
something
of
a
novelty.
and
that
what
is
novel
is
often
novel
because
of
past
constitutional
doubts.
that
is
not
likely
the
reason
here.
the
likely
explanation
is
that
state
agencies
do
not
often
possess
federal
rights
against
their
parent
states
and
they
cannot
sue
to
enforce
those
rights
unless
the
parent
states
consent
to
give
them
independent
litigating
authority.
we
are
unaware
that
these
conditions
have
ever
presented
themselves
except
in
connection
with
the
unusual
federal
statute
at
issue
here.
for
this
and
other
reasons
set
forth
more
fully
in
our
opinion,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
before
the
proceeding
is
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
