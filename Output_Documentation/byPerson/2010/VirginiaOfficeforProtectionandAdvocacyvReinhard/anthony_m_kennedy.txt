justice
anthony
m.

but
there
are
a
number
of
instances
in
the
states
where
constitutional
officers
have
their
separate
autonomy,
their
separate
responsibilities.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
follow
inevitably
from
your
position
that
the
attorney
general
of
state
a
could
sue
the
governor
of
state
a
saying
the
governor
is
being
sued
in
an
ex
parte
young
capacity
because
the
governor
is
not
following
federal
law.
i
think
that's
just
inevitable
from
your
position,
and
that
seems
to
me
a
vast
extension
of
ex
parte
young.
it's
true,
i
think
that
we've
never
said
that
the
identity
of
--
or
that
the
permissibility
of
an
ex
parte
young
suit
depends
on
the
identity
of
the
plaintiff;
but
don't
we
have
to
say
that
here
if
we
are
going
to
allow
the
states
to
structure
their
--
their
own
governments
as
they
choose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
would
tell
the
governor
that
the
governor
is
not
giving
adequate
protection
to
prison
inmates
or
state
employees,
the
--
that
the
governor's
own
personnel
regulations
are
incorrect,
and
he
would
sue
under
ex
parte
young.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
all
kinds
of
federal
rights.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
question
is
can
one
state
entity
enforce
it
against
another
state
entity
in
a
federal
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
--
but
under
--
under
your
theory
there
would
be,
because
under
ex
parte
young
the
whole
point
of
it
is
that
a
--
a
person
can
allege
that
this
fictional
private
individual
who
is
really
a
governmental
individual
is
violating
a
federal
right.
that's
the
whole
point
of
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
state
attorney
generals
have
--
have
the
obligation
to
enforce
federal
rights
for
all
the
citizens
of
their
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
--
that
issue
--
i
know
your
white
line
is
on.
you
indicated
that
there
are
certain
cases
in
which
dams
can
be
authorized
by
the
federal
government,
i
think,
contrary
to
state
laws
and
municipalities.
do
you
know
what
those
are?
there
is
an
iowa
case
and
also
a
washington
case
you
were
talking
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
the
citation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
been
looking
for
it.
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
going
back
to
your
exchange
with
justice
breyer,
i
assume
that
you
could
stand
by
your
answer
and
say
the
attorney
general
could
sue
the
governor,
because
he's
not
suing
the
governor
in
his
official
capacity.
he
has
a
federal
right
under
ex
parte
young
to
sue
the
governor
as
an
individual.
it's
a
fiction,
we
all
know
that.
but
that's
the
way
it
works
and
this
is
a
federal
right.
i
think
that's
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course
--
of
course
verizon
was
a
private
party.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
other
areas
--
and
i
can't
come
up
with
the
name
of
the
case
which
was
suggested
by
counsel,
your
friend,
in
his
opening
argument.
i
thought
there
were
cases
in
which
a
subdivision
is
not
--
a
political
subdivision
of
state
is
not
allowed
to
build
a
dam
by
state
law,
and
yet
it
can
go
to
the
federal
government,
get
a
license,
and
build
the
dam
anyway
and
just
bypass
the
restrictions
put
upon
its
parent.
the
agent
has
more
powers
than
the
principal
gives
it,
because
it
relies
on
federal
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
could
virginia
sue
vopa
in
federal
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
it
could
or
could
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
would
be
the
parent
suing
the
--
the
subsidiary,
and
vopa
is
not
the
state.
