mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
dignity
interest
of
a
sovereign
is
impaired
if
it
is
pitted
against
itself
in
the
courts
of
another
sovereign
without
its
consent.
and
i
would
take--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--well,
let's--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--well,
let
me
--
let
me
first
say
that
the
choice
issue
raises
some
interesting
questions
because
of
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
being
an
interlocutory
appeal.
because
remember,
on
the
issue
of
waiver
and
abrogation,
that
was
litigated
below
and
no
waiver
was
found,
and
that
wasn't
appealed
against.
so
if
we
are
going
to
say
it
makes
a
difference
under
a
spending
statute
that
the
state
has
taken
the
money
in
analyzing
the
sovereign
interest,
then
we
are
creating
a
waiver
on
the
cheap
and
dis-shelving
the
established
doctrine.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
i
would
have
thought
two
things
about
that.
one
is
when
congress
gave
the
state
the
choice
of
making
it
a
state
agency,
it
understood
that
any
issues
that
arise
from
that
would
come
with
the
territory.
the
second
thing
is,
what
the
state
consented
to
is
it
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
to
be
sued,
but
it
did
not
specify
a
suit
in
federal
court
and
under
ordinary
doctrine
that's
a
consent
to
be
sued
in
its
own
courts,
not
in
federal
court.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
i
would
say
two
things
about
that.
the
first
is
that
that's
not
what
congress
did.
congress
said
they
had
to
have
a
right
to
sue
and
they
didn't
specify.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
well,
i
don't
think
the
state
by
restructuring
itself
would
then
ordinarily
expect
its
agencies
to
sue
each
other
in
federal
court.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
i
would
think
that
under
ordinary
rules
of
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
would
limit
the
suits
to
the
suits
of
the
sovereign
of
the
state.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
i
think
the
existing
doctrine
is
an
unspecified
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
is
not
consented
in
federal
court.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
in
referring
to
sovereign
immunity,
i
was
trying
to
answer
the
hypothetical
with
respect
to
why
ex
parte
young
doesn't
apply.
the
second
part
of
the
question
was
congress
could
expect
ex
parte
young
to
apply.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
record
that
i
could
find
of
that.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
excuse
me.
congress
should
have
expected,
in
the
hypothetical
congress
was
posited
as
having
thought--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--okay.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
because
ex
parte
young
is
an
exception
to
the
default
position.
the
default
position
is
that
the
state's
at
the
founding
retained
all
of
their
natural
law
nations
of
sovereign
immunity.
we
know
that
it
was
limited,
a
state
can
sue
another
state,
the
federal
government
can
sue
another
state,
and
can
sue
a
state,
and
there
is
the
ex
parte
young
exception,
but
it
is
the
exception.
it
is
being
extended
here.
we
know
it's
being
extended
here
because
it's
never
been
done
before.
and
if
you
are
going
to
extend
it,
then
we
ought
to
ask
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
asking
the
hans
question.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
well,
what
i
--
what
i
would
say
is
that
ex
parte
young
is
intended
to
deal
with
the
situation
where
a
citizen
of
a
dual
sovereign
is
able
to
vindicate
his
superior
federal
rights
against
the
state.
that
interest
is
not
served
one
bit
by
having
a
state
agency
sue
another
state
agency
in
federal
court,
even
though
that
state
agency
could
have
sued
in
state
court.
and
i
would
ask
the
hans
question.
the
hans
question
is,
would
the
--
you
know,
the
constitution
is
presumed
not
to
raise
up
causes
of
action
against
the
states
that
would
have
been
considered
as
anomalous
and
unheard
of
at
the
time
of
the
founding.
and
i
think
if
you
posited
whether
or
not
at
the
founding,
if
you
had
asked,
can
a
part
of
a
state
--
well,
can
the
federal
congress
authorize
part
of
a
state
to
sue
the
other
part
of
the
state
in
federal
court,
i
think
it
would
have
been
regarded
as
an
anomalous
act.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
i
would
assert
not.
i
mean,
that
was
the
point
of
the
waiver
argument
below,
and
the
court
said
there
had
not
been
a
specific
enough
declaration
of
the
consequences
of
taking
the
money
to
raise
up
the
traditional
waiver.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
the
program
would
go
to
a
state
court.
virginia
has
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
and
there
is
a
remedy
through
mandamus.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
if
you
have
a
--
if
you
have
a
clear
right
to
these
documents
as
a
surrogate,
and
you
know
that's
a
merits
question
that
has
never
been
reached,
whether
this
is
a
rights-conferring
statute.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
i
would
--
i
personally
believe
you
could
also
do
it
in
circuit
court.
i
know
this
office
has
previously
taken
the
position
that
it
had
to
go
to
the
supreme
court,
and
i
don't
want
to
withdraw
any
concession
that
had
been
made
there;
but
i
personally
read
the
statute
differently.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
the
statute,
the
mandamus
statute
has
a
fairly
broad
catch-all
provision
at
the
end
which
i
think
would
allow
suit
in
--
in
circuit
court,
but
i
don't
think
where
it
can
sue
really
informs
the
doctrine
here,
because
i
think
the
doctrine
here
is
if
you
are
going
to
let,
under
the
analysis
argued
here
--
which
is
not
modest,
it's
very,
very
broad
--
if
vopa
can
sue
in
federal
court
under
ex
parte
young,
so
can
any
agency
of
--
of
the
--
any
state
that
receives
federal
funds
upon
which
it
makes
the
claim
at
the
ex
parte
young
stage,
which
is
before
you
reach
the
merits,
any
agency
receiving
federal
money
that
can
dream
up
a
federal
claim
under
ex
parte
young
could
sue
the
state.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
yes,
and
--
and--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--and
i--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--i
think
--
i
think
virginia
happens
to
be
unusual,
as
long
as
we
are
talking
about
the
policy
of
results
that
is
will
come
from
this,
i
think
virginia
is
unusual
in
having
as
much
control
in
the
attorney
general
over
who
can
sue
than
--
than
a
lot
of
states
do;
because
i
think
a
lot
of
states
have
their
own
independent
agencies
that
proliferate
and
have
suit
authority.
but
i
will
tell
you
even
in
virginia
there
is
a
mechanism
by
which
if
you
had
the
governor
in
one
party's
hands
and
the
attorney
general
in
the
other,
the
governor
can
declare
a
conflict
of
interest
and
order
private
counsel
hired.
and
so
if
--
if
the
university
of
virginia
wanted
to
sue
the
governor,
or
rather
sue
the
attorney
general
and
the
governor
said,
"well,
if
you
want
to.
"
and
the
attorney
general
won't
authorize
it,
then
that's
a
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
it's
never
happened
before
because
nobody's
ever
claimed
before
that
ex
parte
young
permits
a
part
of
the
state
to
sue
the
other
part
of
the
state.
and
i
would
say
if
the
word
were
declared
from
this
court
that
you
can
do
that,
that
there
would
be
a
lot
of
political
motivation
to
file
suits.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
and--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--i
--
i
think
--
i
think
whether
or
not
the
state
has
given
independent
authority
to
sue
without
specifying
that
it
can
be
in
federal
court,
without
waiving
its
immunity
in
federal
court,
is
not
the
issue
in
the
case.
i
think
the
issue
in
the
case
--
i
think
that
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
ex
parte
young
should
be
extended
to
do
something
that's
never
been
done
before.
i
think
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
and
i
don't
think
ex
parte
young
--
which
is
a
necessary
fiction,
but
it
is
a
fiction,
it's
a
necessary
fiction
to
allow
the
citizens
of
a
dual
sovereign
to
vindicate
his
or
her
federal
rights
in
federal
court
--
is
implicated
in
the
least
when
it's
a
state
agency
that
could
sue
another
state
agency
by
the
state's
consent
in
state
court.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
i
--
i
am
not
an
expert
in
that
area
of
the
law.
i
would
have
thought
it's
quite
common.
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
know.
that's
just
my
supposition.
i
think
that
--
that--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--i
personally
don't
know
of
one
as
i
stand
here,
but
my
supposition
is
that
because
the
federal
spending
power
has
been
so
dramatically
exercised
over
the
years,
that
there
probably
is
one,
i
had
not
thought
to
look
for
it.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
there
--
there
are
two
things
to
look
at:
lower
subdivisions
of
the
states,
which
in
many
states
are--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--yeah,
but
they
are
just
corporations
in
virginia
and
most
states.
there
are
a
few
states
in
which
they
were
treated
as
something
different,
but
they
are
not
generally
regarded
as
even
units
of
--
subordinate
units
of
government
for
purposes
of
sovereign
immunity.
however,
the
state
itself,
and,
and
its
agencies
are,
and
that's
the
issue
that's
implicated
by
ex
parte
young.
i
would
say
that--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--i
think
that
--
that
the
states
vary
as
to
how
tolerant
they
are
of
having
their
parts
sue
each
other
in
state
court.
i
think
i
have
seen
titles
like
that,
but
i
don't
think
that
as
a
principle
of
federal
jurisdiction
--
because
ultimately,
whether
sovereign
immunity
exists,
if
it's
not
waived,
does
deprive
this
court
--
deprives
this
court
or
parts
of
the
federal
court
of
the
right
to
proceed.
i
think
that
deciding
we
are
going
to
extend
the
fiction
of
ex
parte
young
beyond
the
rights
of
citizens
to
allow
the
state
to
sue
itself
in
federal
court
is
just
something
that's
totally
anomalous.
i
just
don't
see
how
this
court
would
want
to
do
that.
even
--
even
if
it
thought
otherwise,
that
it
was,
you
know,
something
that
could
be
done
under
the
logic
of
ex
parte
young,
i
don't
know
why
you
would
want
to
extend
that
and
create
--
and
create
the
federal
courts
as
a
venue
for
political
grandstanding,
which
is
what
i
think--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--i
think
it
has
--
i
think
it
has
long
been
recognized
that
the
dignity
of
the
state
is
not
offended
at
all
by
a
suit
against
--
against
it
in
its
own
courts
that
it
has
authorized.
i
think
that
it
is
well
understood
that
if
you
bring
a
state
against
its
will
into
a
federal
court,
even
if
you
are
using
the
fiction
of
ex
parte--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--but
this
court
has
always
recognized
that
there
is
a
large
sense
in
which
that's
a
fiction
and
it's
just
something
that
we
have
to
tolerate
in
order
to
have
a
dual
system
of
--
of
sovereignty.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
that
is
precisely
my
argument.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
i
think
it's
all
that
is
really
appropriately
before
this
court,
because
again,
we
are
up
here
on
an
interlocutory
appeal
where
the
decision
below
in
the
fourth
circuit
by
judge
wilkinson
is
premised
entirely
on
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
one,
the
state
is
being
pitted
against
itself.
if
you
look
at
the
very
caption
in
this
case,
vopa
sued
state
officials
in
the
name
of
the
commonwealth.
secondly,
there's
a
--
to
the
extent
there
is
any
authority,
we
have
ex
parte
young
here
that
gives
rights
to
citizens,
and
we
have
a
lot
of
cases
that
resulted
most
recently
in
cersa,
in
which
it
was
recognized
that
the
general
rule
is
that
subordinate
parts
of
states,
subordinate
state
authorities,
have
no
constitutional
privileges
and
immunities
that
they
can
assert
against
their
creator.
and
if
you
wanted
to
know
whether
or
not
ex
parte
young
should
be
extended
into
this
area,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
previous
expectation
would
have
been
that
the
asersa
tradition
would
have
said,
no,
we
don't
want
to
extend
into
this
area.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
i
don't
know
the
case.
and
i
don't
believe
anybody
has
cited
as
a
principal
case
a
decision
of
this
court
that
would
say
that.
now,
a
state
can
do
anything
it
--
it
wanted
to
in
terms
of
waiving
its
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
it
appropriately
could.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
i
do
not
think
it
appropriately
could.
i
don't
think
parts
of
the
state
can
sue
other
parts
of
the
state
in
federal
court.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
vopa
is
part
of
the
state
for
purposes
of
sovereign
immunity
analysis,
i
would
have
thought.
but
if
somebody
tried
to
get
a
personal
recovery
--
i
mean,
vopa
employees
are
ordinary
state
employees.
i
presume
they
are
subject
to
the
tort
claims
act,
so
it
is
a
state
agency.
but
i
don't
know
why
the
involuntary
suing
of
the
state
in
federal
court,
which
i
think
raises
these
traditional
sovereignty
dignity
interests,
would
be
reciprocal.
i
mean,
if
for
some
strange
reason
the
state
wanted
to
sue
vopa,
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
would
be,
because
maybe
they
waived
all
their
interests
if
they
tried
to
do
that.
but
i
think
that
the
practical
problem
for
this
court
is
that
there's
no
limit.
there
is
no
practical
principal
limit
to
what's
being
argued
here.
so
we
set
up
this
intermural
political
contest
in
federal
court
as
a
matter
of
course,
and
i
think,
doctrinally,
it's
clear
that
it's
an
extension
of
ex
parte
young,
beyond
dispute,
and
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
be
extended
without
doing
a
federalism
inquiry.
and
i
think
if
you
do
a
federalism
inquiry,
you
ask
the
hans
question:
is
--
would
this
have
been
regarded
as
anomalous
and
unheard
of
at
the
founding?
and
i
don't
think
there's--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--i
don't
think
so,
for
two
reasons.
one
is--
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
--i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
congress
could
have,
under
traditional
waiver
authority,
under
the
spending
power,
have
said:
if
you
want
to
take
the
money,
we're
making
a
clear
statement,
you
have
to
waive
your
sovereign
immunity
and
be
sued
in
state
--
i
mean,
federal
court.
that
didn't
happen.
also,
let's
not
overlook
the
fact
that
the
secretary
has
an
administrative
remedy
in
withholding
the
funds,
and
when
this
court
was
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
to
extend
ex
parte
young
in
the
seminole
tribe,
the
answer
was:
no,
we're
not
going
to
do
it,
because
there
is
an
alternative--
mr.

--well,
no,
because
i
don't
think
it
would
ever.
mr.

congress
conditioned
on
receiving
the
money
on
waiver,
i
suppose.
mr.

the
law,
under
traditional
waiver
doctrine
had
been
done
right,
no,
we
wouldn't
have
a
case.
but
remember,
the
law
of
the
case
in
this
interlocutory
appeal
is
that
there
was
no
waiver.
that
waiver
was
determined
below
and
not
appealed.
mr.
earle
duncan
getchell
jr
and
so
under
the
circumstances
here
we
have
a
fairly
peculiar
specialized
situation,
but
deciding
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
i
think
is
fraught
with
peril
and
is
doctrinally
unprecedented
and
improper
and
we
would
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
be
affirmed.
