the
receipt
of
federal

suppose
the
government
said:
if
you
want
medicaid
funds,
the
state
agency
that
administers
the
medicaid
program
must
be
headed
by
a
person
who
has
a
20-year
term
of
office
and
is
removable
only
for
gross
dereliction
of
duty.
can
they
do
that?
can
the
federal
government
do
that?
can
congress
do
it?
justice

that
it
could
be
sued
by
vopa
not
only
in
the
state
courts
but
also
in
federal
court?
