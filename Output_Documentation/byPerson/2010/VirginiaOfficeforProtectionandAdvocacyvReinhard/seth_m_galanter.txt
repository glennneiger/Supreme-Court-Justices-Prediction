mr.
seth
m.
galanter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
virginia
office
for
protection
and
advocacy,
known
as
vopa>
["],
seeks
to
enforce
its
federal
statutory
right
to
inspect
and
copy
records
that
are
in
possession
of
state
officials
who
run
state-operated
hospitals.
respondents
acknowledged
below
that
if
petitioner
were
a
private
entity,
ex
parte
young
would
permit
this
suit.
vopa's
status
as
a
state
entity
does
not
change
the
ex
parte
young
analysis
because
it
imposed
neither
a
greater
burden
on
the
treasury
nor
the
dignity
of
the
state.
the
only
issue
to
be
resolved
by
the
federal
court
is
who
has
the
correct
reading
of
federal
law
about
the
records
access
issue.
it--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--well,
your
honor,
if
i
could
clarify.
first
of
all,
there
would
have
to
be
a
question
of
federal
law.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
it
would
have
to--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--i
think
that
inquiry
goes
to
the
question
of
adversity
and
standing,
the
article
iii
question.
and
this
case
doesn't
involve
that
because
vopa
is
independent
of
the
entity--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--it's
independent
from
the
executive
branch.
it's
independent
from
the
respondents
it's
trying
to
sue.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
the
statute
requires
independence.
the
federal
statute
requires
that
vopa
be
independent.
but
it's
independent
here
because
its
commission,
only
a
third
of
it
is
appointed
by
the
governor
and
none
of
the
members
of
the
commission
that
run
vopa
can
be
removed
except
for
cause.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
that
is
correct.
that
is,
the
sovereign,
the
commonwealth,
could
repeal
the
law
that
enacted
vopa,
just
as
in
this
court's
cases,
icc
v.
united
states,
congress
could
have
removed,
eliminated
the
icc.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
well,
i
believe
this
court
has
continually
held
that
independent
agencies
and
other
federal
agencies
can
litigate,
the
cases
involving
the
federal
labor
relations
board.
and
this
court
has
allowed,
for
example,
suits
about
licenses
for
federal
dams
where
one
agency
wants
to
build
a
federal
dam
and
another--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--if
that's
right,
and
i
think
it
is
if
they
are
part
of
the
same,
if
they
are
subsidiaries
of
one
corporation
and
aren't
separate.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
i
had
understood
that
to
be
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
they
were
divisions
of
a
single
legal
entity.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
i
do
believe
then
that
there
could
be
litigation
between
them,
but
ultimately
there
wouldn't
be.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
well,
that's
true
that
after
the
litigation
is
over,
one
of
the
parties
may,
you
know,
be
able
to
work
around
the
law.
that's
true,
in
fact,
in
every
federal
spending
clause
statute
where
you
are
dealing
with
prospective
relief.
the
state
is
always
free
to
say,
okay,
if
this
is
what
we
have
to
do
we
opt
out
of
the
program.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
well,
it's
the
commonwealth
that
is
free
to
dissolve
one
of
the
parties.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
i
know.
i
meant,
as
opposed
to
--
i
wasn't
making
--
but
the
respondents
here
are
state
officials
and
even
the
respondents'
agency
has
no
power
over
ipas
and
on
the
day
to
day
basis
even
the
governor
and
the
attorney
general
have
no
control
over
what
ipas
--
excuse
me,
vopa
does.
ipas
is
a
similar
case
out
of
indiana.
but
what
is
critical
here
is
that
as
we
stand
here
today,
the
commonwealth
has
vested
a
federal
right
in
vopa
and
neither
the
attorney
general
nor
the
governor
of
virginia
can
stop
vopa
from
exercising
that
right.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
i--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--if
i
may,
there
are
--
there
are
three
issues
that
are
intertwined
here.
first,
the
issue
that
i
was
talking
about
with
the
chief
justice
regarding
the
article
iii
adversity
that
you
need
for
standing,
that
is
where
the
independence
is
relevant.
the
second
question
is
the
one
that
we
petitioned
on,
which
is
the
eleventh
amendment
issue,
and
there
we
would
suggest
that
the
simple
straightforward
inquiry
of
verizon
is
relevant.
and
then
there
is
a
third
portion
which
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
rely
on,
which
is
that
--
the
notion
that
the
state
has
a
federal
right
at
all
with
some
--
against
another
part
of
the
state
and
its
officials
was
incongruous.
that,
if
anything,
would
be
a
tenth
amendment
concern,
and
is
resolved
here
because
it
was
the
commonwealth
itself
that
made
the
voluntary
decision
to
vest
these
federal
rights
in
independent
state
agencies.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
it
--
it
is
not
the
case
in
virginia
or
in
49
of
the
50
states.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
i--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--i
do
think
there
might
be
a
problem,
first
requiring
it.
and
i
think
there
might
even
be
a
problem
if
it
were
a
spending
clause
statute
alone.
but
if
--
i
realize
that's
the
--
but
that's
not
an
eleventh
amendment
problem.
that's
a
question
about
whether--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--and
here
the
only
question,
because
--
the
only
question
addressed
below
and
the
only
question
--
this
is
all
on
the
interlocutory
appeal
just
on
the
eleventh
amendment--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--is
whether
we
can
sue
other
officials
in
the
state
to
bring
them
into
prospective
compliance
with
the
federal
law,
as
--
as
i
said,
though,
and
this
statute
authorizes
the
state
if
it
takes
the
money
to
designate
either
a
public
or
private
entity
as
its
protection
and
advocacy
system.
that
is,
they
could
have
vested
these
federal
rights
in
a
nonprofit
corporation--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--i
--
i
think
that
they're
both
sufficiently
jurisdictional
that
you
could
reach
them
in
--
in
--
you
wouldn't
have
to
reach
article
iii
before
the
eleventh
amendment.
but
i
do
think
that
the
article
iii
question
--
i
mean,
this
court
in
its
foia
decisions
such
as
you
know,
public
citizen
v.
department
of
justice,
has
said
that
congress
can
create
a
right
to
access
to
information--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
it
--
it
and
its
predecessors
were
created
just
to
implement
this
program.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
it
has
a
few
responsibilities
that
the
state
has
given
it
under
state
law
in
addition,
but
its
primary
function
--
and
at
this
point
all
its
budget
comes
from
the
federal
government,
and
it
serves
primarily
this
federal
function
to
go
into
public
and
private
institutions
to
observe
and
make
sure
that
abuse
and
neglect
is
not
occurring
there.
and
that
is
obviously
why
these
records
were
requested,
because
the
statute
gives
the
protection
and
advocacy
service
a
right
to
access
records
of
people
in
the
institution
to
make
sure
that
they
are
not
being
mistreated
and
that
investigations
and
the
oversights
by
the
state
are
taking
place
and
are
being
done
correctly.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
that
--
that
is
correct.
and
then
the
legislature
of
the
commonwealth
went
in
and
gave
vopa
independent
litigating
authority,
independent
of
the
attorney
general.
on
the
eleventh
amendment
point,
which
is
again--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--well,
i
--
again,
i
would
go
back
to
the
federal
analogy,
that
in
all
this
litigation
with
the
icc
or
--
well,
with
the
federal
labor
relations
authorities,
with
the
licensing
authority
of
the
department
of
interior
for
dams
that
--
that,
you
know,
the
tva
might
want
to
build,
that
congress
can
always
eliminate
these
agencies,
but
while
they
are
still
in
existence--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--well,
i
think
it's
because
you
look
at
standing
in
terms
of
the
current
reality,
and
in
nixon,
for
example,
the
attorney
general
had
promulgated
a
regulation
saying
he
couldn't
dismiss
the
special
prosecutor
except
for
cause.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
well,
i
would
say
that
--
well,
i
would
say
two
things.
first,
the
idea
that
you
have
to
accept,
as
i
think
respondents
do
in
this
case,
that
the
virginia
office
of
protection
and
advocacy
legitimately
holds
a
federal
right.
i
can't
--
i
am
hard
pressed
and
--
and
respondents
and
their
amici
were
hard
pressed
--
to
come
up
with
any
example
where
an
attorney
general
would
hold
a
federal
right
against
another
part
of
the
state.
and
particularly
here--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--if
the
commonwealth--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--well,
but
they
are
generally
not--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--the
--
there
are
not
a
lot
of
federal
rights
that
state
officials
have
against
other
officials.
here,
this
is
a
right--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--violating
the
plaintiff's
federal
right.
that
was
the
only
point
i
was
making.
but
yes,
if
there
are
federal
disputes
at
issue,
a
federal
forum
is
appropriate.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
and
if
they
have
that
right
under
--
power
under
state
law,
then
--
and
they
exercise
that
power
and
elect
to
be
in
federal
court
to
litigate
federal
issues,
that
is
not
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
we
would
submit.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
i
believe
the
case
here
i'm
thinking
of
comes
out
of
seattle.
but
--
but
i
think--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--i
don't
have
it
with
me.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
but
--
but
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
sometimes
one
federal
agency
needs
permission
from
another
federal
agency
to
build
something,
and
there
would
be
a
litigable
controversy
under
article
3,
and
that
was
the
only
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
if
i
may,
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
i
have
three
points
for
those
three
minutes.
first,
we
don't
think
that
a
state
ag
or
state
agency
could
sue
a
governor
if
state
law
prohibited
it.
the
question
of
capacity
to
sue,
the
power
to
sue
is
one
of
state
law.
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
if
a
suit
could
go
forward
between
two
state
agencies,
between
state
agency
and
state
officials
in
state
court,
and
if
that
case
involved
a
federal
issue,
it
can
be
heard
in
federal
court
if
the
other
requirements
of
article
iii
and
ex
parte
young
are
being
met.
second,
there
was
some
suggestion
that
ex
parte
young
is
only
about
citizens.
but
this
court's
applied
ex
parte
young
to
indian
tribes,
allowing
them
to
sue
state
officials.
it's
allowed
foreign
countries
to
use
ex
parte
young
to
sue
state
officials.
and
the
respondents
concede
that
political
subdivisions,
which
can
also
be
eliminated
at
will
by
the
state,
could
use
ex
parte
young.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
no.
there
aren't
a
lot
of
them.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
other
than
in
this
protection
advocacy
system.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
none.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
well,
but
that's
because
congress
doesn't
usually
vest
rights
in--
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
--i
don't
think
that's
correct.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
i
think
that
most
of
the
time
when
a
state
is
involved
in
a
dispute
with
another
state,
it's
about
state
law.
this
is
rather
unique
in
that
respect.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
third
point,
which
is
this
notion
of
waiver.
we
are
not
arguing
here
that
they
have
waived
their
sovereign
immunity.
what
we
are
claiming
is
that
they
don't
have
sovereign
immunity
to
these
injunctive
suits
against
the
state
officials.
we
are
not
seeking
damages
and
we
haven't
named
the
state
in
its
own
name.
but
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
it
was
the
natural
consequence
as
this
court
decided
in
frew,
that
when
you,
you
know,
accept
the
federal
money
and
you
are
bound
by
federal
duties
and
that
the
entity
that
you
give
the
federal
right
to
has
a
federal
--
has
a
right
to
sue,
that
the
federal
issues,
federal
issues
will
be
litigated
in
federal
court.
and
i
would
say
particularly
that
here
just,
of
course
virginia
renews
every
year
to
take
the
federal
money,
but
when
it
last
amended
the
federal
statute
or
the
state
statute
to
create
vopa
in
its
current
structure,
there
were
existing
ex
parte
young
suits
against
state
officials.
mr.
seth
m.
galanter
i
am
drawing
that
from
the
indiana's
amicus
brief
and
i
believe
they
identified
new
jersey
as
a
state
that
has
a
unitary
executive.
