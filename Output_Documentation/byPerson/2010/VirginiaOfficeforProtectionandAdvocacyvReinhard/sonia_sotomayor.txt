why
is
that
true?
if
they
are
separate
corporate
entities,
what
legal
rule
would
stop
a
separate
corporate
entity
from
suing
another?
is
there
--
if
they
are
part
of
the
same
company,
i
think
that's
a
different
issue.
if
they
are
the
same
company,
that's
a
different
issue
and
just
a
different
branch
or
a
different
office.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
the
premise
of
your
argument
is.
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
the
independence
of
the
state
agency
is
what
makes
this
particular
entity
capable
of
suing.
yet
in
your
brief
you
rely
on
verizon's
simple
test,
which
says
if
you
are
asserting
a
federal
claim
you
can
sue
and
you're
not
--
and
you
are
looking
for
prospective
injunctive
relief;
you
can
sue
the
state.
that
general
rule
wouldn't
look
at
who's
suing.
that
was
part
of
your
argument.
yet
now
you
are
arguing
the
independence
of
the
agency.
which
is
your
position.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
if
it
is
the
one
about
the
state's
independence,
how
do
you
articulate
why
that
becomes
important
or
not?
what's
the
legal
significance
of
that
vis-a-vis
this
case
and
any
ones
moving
forward?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
following
up
on
justice
scalia's
question
to
you,
his
question
in
fact
is
in
part
what
happened
here.
virginia
at
some
point
did
require
every
state
agency
to
seek
the
permission
of
its
attorney
general,
is
it,
to
sue?
and
the
government
said
that's
not
independent
enough,
and
if
you
want
the
money
you've
got
to
make
vopa
eligible
to
sue
without
that
permission;
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
be
a
little
bit
more
specific
for
me
on
what
you
mean
about
an
article
3
problem?
justice
kennedy
was
concerned
about
state
attorney
generals
willy-nilly
suing
--
or
not
willy-nilly,
suing
governors
to
comply
with
federal
law.
why
do
you
think
it
won't
happen,
and
what
are
the
legal
impediments
to
that
occurring?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
i
think
there
are
concepts
being
confused.
there
is
no
question
that
it
hasn't
waived
sovereign
immunity.
vopa
doesn't
claim
that.
and
this
is
not
a
direct
suit
against
the
state,
it's
a
suit
against
a
state
official.
and
the
entire
premise
of
ex
parte
young
is
that
this
doesn't
offend
sovereign
immunity
for
a
party
to
seek
enforcement,
prospectively,
of
a
federal
right.
so
i
don't
know
why
it
really
matters
who
the
plaintiff
is
so
long
as
the
sovereign
interests
that
we
recognized,
that
the
issue
of
sovereignty
is
one
that
respects
a
state's
coffers
and
state's
laws
and
we
are
not
going
to
interfere
with
any
of
them,
but
we
are
going
to
ensure
that
because
of
the
preemptive
effect
of
the
constitution
and
our
laws
that
federal
laws
are
respected.
so
what's
in
this
case
the
intrusion
on
state
sovereignty
when
the
state
knew
and
consented
consciously
to
letting
vopa
sue
for
records
when
it
needed
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
state
should
have
expected
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
hasn't
happened.
why
do
you
think?
don't
you
think
it
hasn't
happened
because
there
are
so
many
practical
political
restraints
on
that
kind
of
activity?
what
would
happen
i
think
in
that
state
where
there
was
a
rogue
attorney
general
is
somebody
would
win;
the
governor
would
win
by
getting
a
legislative
act
that
says
it
can't
be
done,
or
the
attorney
general
will
win
because
the
political
sentiments
are
so
strong
in
his
or
her
favor
that
the
suit
is
actually
welcomed
by
the
population.
so
where
is
the
intrusion
on
sovereignty?
states
do
what
they
want.
the
only
issue
is
how
do
we
protect
federal
rights.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
that
--
what
you
are
forgetting
is
that
virginia
took
a
lot
of
money
to
set
up
and
get
the
benefits
of
federal
funds
by
creating
an
independent
agency.
it
had
expressed
its
desire
to
control
the
agency
more,
and
it
was
told
very
directly:
you
can't.
you
have
to
let
that
agency
sue.
what
i
don't
understand
is
why
you
think
that
it's
a
greater
affront
to
sovereignty
that
the
suit
is
here
as
opposed
to
state
court.
the
state
has
already
said:
we're
going
to
take
your
money
and
this
is
what
we're
going
to
permit,
a
suit.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
we
use
--
we
don't
bring
the
state
in.
we
bring
in
the
state
official
who
is
violating
a
federal
law.
