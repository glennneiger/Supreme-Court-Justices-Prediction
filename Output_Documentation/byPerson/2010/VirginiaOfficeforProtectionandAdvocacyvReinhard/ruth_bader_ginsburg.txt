mr.
galanter,
if
we
can
go
back
to
get
what
this
--
this
entity
was.
the
federal
legislation
gives
the
states
a
choice
to
do
it
either
in
the
state
agency
or
a
private
entity.
the
specification
that
the
state
agency
has
to
be
independent
is
in
the
federal
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
--
it's
not
up
to
the
state
to
want
to
put
it
into
an
independent
regulatory
agency.
and
is
this
vopa,
is
that
an
entity
that
was
created
just
to
carry
out
this
federal
program
or
was
it
a
preexisting
agency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
ever
do
anything
else
other
than
administer
the
federal
program?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
anders,
i
understand
that
most
states
that
are
taking
advantage
of
this
program
do
it
through
a
private
agency,
not
a
state;
is
that
--
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't
the
federal
statute
say:
virginia,
if
you
want
to
do
this
through
a
state
agency,
that
state
agency
has
to
be
an
independent
agency
and
has
the
authority
to
sue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
a
waiver,
it's
the
federal
statute
is
clear.
it
says
state,
you
can
do
this
in
one
of
two
ways.
if
you
go
with
the
government
agency,
then
that
agency
has
to
have
independence
and
it
has
to
be
able
to
sue.
so
if
the
state
is
given
a
choice,
it
has
--
it
can
do
it
through
private
entity,
it
can
do
it
through,
as
in
this
case,
an
agency
that
was
set
up
for
this
very
purpose
and
no
other,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
point
is,
if
it's
not
in
--
you
certainly
agree
that
this
state
agency
has
taken
on
the
obligations
of
the
federal
program,
and
if
it
doesn't
turn
over
records
as
the
federal
statute
requires
it
to
do,
it
has
to
be
amenable
to
suit
somewhere.
we
know
if
it
were
a
private
entity
administering
this
program
it
would
be
suable
in
--
in
federal
court.
so
this
state
agency
is
doing
the
exact
same
thing,
because
virginia
chose
it
to
do
it
that
way.
where
--
where
--
a
very
simple
thing,
the
federal
statute
says
turn
over
records
to
the
agency,
and
the
state
hospital
says
no,
we
are
not
going
to
turn
over
the
records.
where
does
the
agency,
whether
private
or
public,
that
is
administering
the
federal
program
go
to
enforce
the
federal
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
--
is
that
--
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understood
what
your
position
is
on
that.
it's
not
that
you
go
into
the
court
that
you
ordinarily
go
to
when
you
want
to
get
documents
in
discovery,
you
go
to
the
state's
supreme
court
and
you
--
you
apply
for
the
extraordinary
writ
of
mandamus,
that's
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
you
what
is
the
forum?
we
have
a
simple
problem.
an
agency,
whether
private
or
public,
wants
records.
federal
statute
says
you
are
entitled
to
the
records.
and
i
would
like
to
know
now,
virginia
having
chosen
to
give
this
newly
created
independent
state
agency
the
authority
rather
than
picking
a
501(c)(3)
organization
to
do
it
--
simple,
we
want
records
of
these
three
people,
the
hospital
has
them,
the
hospital
doesn't
give
them
to
us.
the
only
way
under
virginia
law
is
to
petition
the
highest
court
of
the
state
for
a
writ
of
mandamus?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
which
office
has
said
it
has
to
go
to
--
to
the
state
supreme
court
on
mandamus?
you
said
that
the
office
has
taken
that
position
previously?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
--
do
you
know
of
any
other
statute
in
which
there
is
an
independent
state
agency
that
exists
for
the
sole
purpose
of
administering
a
federal
program?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
couldn't
give
any
example
of
a
federal
program
that
says
state,
you
can
do
it
through
a
private
agency;
you
can
do
it
through
a
public
agency
--
public
agency
created
to
implement
this
federal
program,
that
is
until
all
this
--
i
don't
really
know
of
any
such.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
bottom
line,
then,
is
that
--
to
restrict
congress's
choice.
congress
wants
to
have
an
entity
to
attend
this
program
for
disabled
people.
so
the
instruction
we
would
like
to
give
congress
is:
congress,
if
you
want
federal
courts
to
be
able
to
enforce
the
federal
right,
then
you
have
to
set
it
up
as
an
agency,
as
a
private
agency.
you
can't
give
--
congress,
you
can't
give
the
states
a
choice
whether
they
would
rather
do
it
through
private
or
public--
