justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
this
so
complicated?
i'm
probably
missing
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
thing
--
but
it
doesn't
help
you,
i
don't
think,
if
it
isn't
complicated.
that
is,
because
of
burlington
we
are
only
talking
about
a
certain
number
of
employees
who
could
make
an
employer
responsible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so
those
are
supervisory
people,
we'll
call
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why
don't
we
just
stop
there
and
just
say,
we
have
a
statute,
the
statute
says
that
if
--
if
a
bad
motive
was
a
motivating
--
had
to
be
a
motivating
factor,
discriminatory
--
discriminatory
motivating
factor
in
the
dismissal,
then,
unless
you
can
prove
an
affirmative
defense,
you
lose.
why
do
we
have
to
have
something
special
if
one
of
these
small
group
of
employees
happens
to
be
the
person
who
said
the
last
words
or
happens
to
be
somebody
who
told
somebody
who
said
the
last
words
or
happens
to
be
somebody
who
told
the
somebody
the
something-or-other?
you
are
just
looking
for
one
thing.
and
there
could
be
five
zillion
fact
situations.
so
why
something
special?
why
did
the
seventh
circuit
say
where
it's
not
the
guy
who
said
the
last
words
you
have
to
show,
quote,
"singular
influence"?
why
singular
influence?
why
not
just
what
the
statute
says,
that
it
was
--
that
it
led
to
the
--
what
she
said
led
to
the
discriminatory
motive
being
a
motivating
factor,
period,
end
of
the
matter.
no
special
"cat's
paw"
rule,
no
special
anything
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no.
of
course
you
have
to
show
proximate
cause.
you
have
to
show
cause.
you
always
do.
i'm
just
saying,
why
have
a
special
rule?
why
not
have
a
special
rule
if
somebody
was
on
the
second
floor?
you
wouldn't
think
of
that.
so
if
you
were
not
going
to
do
it
because
the
person's
on
the
second
floor,
why
do
it
because
they
happen
to
be
somebody
who
told
somebody
rather
than
somebody
who
was
the
person
who
was
told?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
you
are
perfectly
entitled
to
say
that.
but
what
i
don't
see
that
you
are
entitled
to
say
are
the
words
that
the
seventh
circuit
used,
which
is:
you
have
to
show
jury
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
singular
influence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
doesn't
just
sound
like
it
was
a
motivating
cause.
that
sounds
like
something
really
special.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
okay.
so
why
don't
we
say:
seventh
circuit,
if
that's
your
way
of
saying
it
is
just
a
normal
thing
like
cause,
we
accept
that,
but
please
don't
use
those
words.
and
because
you
might
have
used
--
you
might
have
used
them
meaning
something
else,
we
will
send
this
back
so
we
are
certain
that
what
you
are
doing
is
applying
the
same
test
to
everything.
in
other
words,
was
it
a
motivating
factor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that
seems
like
a
good
resolution
of
this
case
to
me.
i
don't
know
if
it
does
to
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
can't
agree
with
me,
because
my
question
was
why
would
that
be?
you
have
two
people,
a
and
b,
they
are
both
supervisors;
in
the
one
case
b
fires
the
employee
because
he
is
in
the
army,
and
he
says
it:
ha,
ha,
that's
why
i'm
doing
it.
in
the
second
case
he
fires
the
employee
because
he
thought
the
employee
was,
in
one
of
justice
sotomayor's
hypotheticals
or
anyone
else,
he
fires
him
for
a
perfectly
good
reason,
but
a
has
lied
about
it.
and
the
reason
a
lied
about
it
was
because
she
wanted
to
tell
him
a
lie
so
b
would
fire
the
employee,
and
her
reason
is
because
he's
in
the
army.
those
two
situations,
the
second
seems
to
me
one
of
80
--
80
million
situations,
fact-related,
that
could
arise,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
want
a
special
standard
for
such
a
situation.
why
not
just
ask
the
overall
question,
was
this
action
an
action
that
was
--
in
which
the
bad
motive
was
a
motivating
factor.
forget
psychoanalysis
of
a.
b
is
good
enough
--
or
vice
versa.
that
was
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
together
they
dismissed
the
employee.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
by
supplying
the
false
statement,
the
other
by
acting
on
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
both
agents.
that's
why
i
made
them
both
burlington
people.
i
wanted
to
get
them
in
the
group.
they
both
have
the
same
burlington
status,
so
we
get
that
issue
out
of
it.
and
together
they
fire
this
individual.
in
the
absence
of
either
the
one
or
the
other,
he
wouldn't
have
been
fired.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
feel
i'm
going
to
get
nowhere
pursuing
this
hypothetical
further.
so
i
will
drop
it
and
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--answer
it
as
you
wish
or
as
you
understand
it.
