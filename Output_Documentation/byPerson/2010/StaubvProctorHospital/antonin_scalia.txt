but
you
say
that
those
decisions
that
contribute
have
to
be
decisions
by
supervisory
personnel.
if
your
theory
is
correct,
i
don't
know
why
that
is
so.
i
don't
know
why
a
co-employee
who
has
a
hostile
motivation
and
makes
a
report
to
the
supervisor
who
ultimately
dismisses
the
individual,
why
that
--
that
wouldn't
qualify
as
well.
justice
antonin

the
employer
would
be
liable
for
these
lower
supervisory
employees
here
why?
did
they
have
authority
to
discharge?
justice

why
do
they
stand
in

mr.
schnapper,
i
guess
this
goes
back
to
justice
alito's
question.
i
find
it
difficult
to
grasp
the
distinction
that
you
draw
or
what
is
seems
could
possibly
exist
between
a
willful
motivating
factor
and
a
non-willful
motivating
factor.
i
mean,
to
say
that
it's
motivating
is
--
is
to
say
that
it's
willful,
it
seems
to
me.
but
you
want
us
to
draw
a
distinction
between
a
willful
motivating
factor
and
a
non-willful
motivating
factor?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
hold
the
employer
liable
for
the
actions
of
these
other
officials,
other
than
the
one
who
did
the
firing.
and
if
they
are
liable
for
--
if
you
hold
them
the
employer
liable
for
their
contribution
to
the
firing,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
hold
him
liable
for
their
willfulness
as
well.

i
think
that
you've
misread
--
i
think
that
you've
misread
the
"cat's
paw"
principle
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
think
that
it
is,
to
them,
a
determination
of
proximate
cause
at
all.
as
i
understand
their
opinion,
they
say
that
the
statute
requires
that
the
--
let
me
get
the
right
language
here
--
that
the
discriminatory,
prohibited
discriminatory
factor,
must
have
been
a
motivating
factor
in
the
employer's
action.
and
they
say
that
means
it
must
have
motivated
the
person
who
took
the
employer's
action.
it's
not
a
motivating
factor
in
the
employer's
action
unless
the
person
who
took
the
action
on
behalf
of
the
employer
had
that
as
its
motive.
then
the
court
of
appeals
makes
an
exception:
however,
if
the
person
who
appears
to
be
taking
the
action
on
behalf
of
the
employer
is
really
not
the
person
who
took
the
action,
but
was
totally
under
the
control
of
a
subordinate
who
--
and
the
person
just
swallowed
that
subordinate's
determination,
then
we
will
hold,
even
though
the
ultimate
firing
--
the
person
who
signed
the
pink
slip,
even
though
that
person
didn't
have
the
motive
--
if
in
fact
the
decision
was
effectively
the
decision
of
a
lower
subordinate,
we
will
hold
the
employer.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
proximate
cause.
it
has
to
do
with
the
text
that
it
has
to
be
a
motivating
factor
in
the
employer's
action;
not
a
motivating
factor
somewhere
down
the
line,
but
in
the
employer's
action.
that's
how
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
the
point.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
establish
--
we
are
not
going
to
second-guess
the
jury
determination
here.
i
understood
your
point
to
be
that
there's
a
difference
between
a
motivating
factor
in
the
decision,
which
means
the
person
who
made
the
decision
on
behalf
of
the
employer
must
have
had
that
motive,
and
on
the
other
hand,
a
factor
which
was
relevant
to
the
decision,
or
a
factor
which
influenced
the
decision.
that's
quite
different
from
a
motivating
factor
in
the
decision.
you
have
to
get
us
to
believe
--
and
i'm
not
sure
we
will
--
that
motivating
factor
in
the
decision
refers
to
motive
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
made
the
decision.
that's
essentially
your
point,
isn't
it?
justice

how
does
the

this

justice

that
doesn't

to
be
so
damning
of
your

i
think
if
this

had
been
asked
the
reasons

it
would
have
given

justice

well,
i
don't
think
anybody
thought
that
buck
would
have
fired
him
just
for
that
one
absence.
that
was
the
trigger.
but
it
was
the
trigger
that
followed
a
long
series
of
prior
absences
for
which
he
had
been
disciplined
before.
i
don't
see
any
inconsistency
between
those
two
versions.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
petitioner,
vincent
staub
worked
as
an
angiography
technician
for
the
respondent,
proctor
hospital
until
2004
when
he
was
fired.
staub
and
proctor
dispute
the
facts
surrounding
with
firing,
but
because
a
jury
found
for
staub
in
his
claim
of
employment
discrimination
against
proctor,
we
describe
the
facts
viewed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
staub.
while
employed
by
proctor,
staub
was
a
member
of
the
united
states
army
reserve,
which
required
him
to
attend
drill
one
weekend
per
month
and
to
train
full
time
for
two
to
three
weeks
a
year.
both
janice
--
janice
mulally,
staub's
immedia
--
staub's
immediate
supervisor
and
michael
korenchuk,
mulally's
supervisor,
were
hostile
to
staub's
military
obligations.
in
january
2004,
mulally
issued
staub
a
disciplinary
warning
for
purportedly
violating
a
company
rule.
the
warning
included
a
directive
that
staub
to
report
to
mulally
or
to
korenchuk
when
he
had
no
patients.
according
to
staub,
mulally's
justification
for
the
disciplinary
warning
was
false.
in
april
2004,
korenchuk
informed
linda
buck,
proctor's
vice
president
of
human
resources,
that
staub
had
violated
the
directive
in
the
january
disciplinary
warning,
an
accusation
which
according
to
staub
was
also
false.
buck
relied
on
korenchuk's
accusation,
however,
and
after
reviewing
staub's
personnel
file,
she
decided
to
fire
him.
the
termination
notice
stated
that
staub
had
ignored
the
directive
issued
in
the
january
2004
warning.
staub
sued
proctor
under
the
uniformed
services
employment
and
reemployment
rights
act
of
1994
or
userra,
which
prohibits
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
a
person's
membership
in
or
obligation
to
a
uniformed
service.
it
provides
that
an
employer
shall
be
considered
to
have
engaged
in
employment
discrimination
if
the
person's
membership
or
obligation
is
a
“motivating
factor
in
the
employer's
action.”
staub
claimed
that
his
discharge
was
motivated
by
hostility
to
his
obligations
as
a
military
reservist.
his
contention
was
not
that
buck,
who
was
the
--
the
proctor
agent
who
did
the
actual
firing,
not
that
buck
had
any
such
hostility
but
that
mulally
and
korenchuk
did
and
that
their
actions
influenced
buck's
ultimate
employment
decision.
the
jury
found
in
staub's
favor
and
awarded
$57,000
in
change
in
damages.
the
seventh
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
proctor
was
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
court
observed
that
staub
had
brought
what
the
seventh
circuit
calls
a
“cat's
paw
case",
meaning
that
he
sought
to
hold
his
employer
liable
for
the
animus
of
a
supervisor
who
was
not
charged
with
making
the
ultimate
employment
decision.
the
theory
is
that
that
agent
is
just
the
"cat's
paw"
of
agents
further
down
the
line.
it
explained
that
under
seventh
circuit
precedent
a
“cat's
paw”
case
could
not
succeed
unless
the
nondecisionmaker
exercised
such
singular
influence
over
the
decisionmaker
that
the
decision
to
terminate
was
the
product
of
“blind
reliance.”
it
then
noted
that
buck
looked
beyond
what
mulally
and
korenchuk
said
relying
in
part
on
her
review
of
staub's
personnel
file.
because
the
undisputed
evidence
established
that
buck
was
not
wholly
dependent
on
the
advice
of
korenchuk
and
mulally,
the
court
held
that
proctor
was
entitled
to
judgment.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit.
the
central
difficulty
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
construing
the
statutory
phrase
“motivating
factor
in
the
employment's
action.”
when
the
company
official
who
makes
the
decision
to
take
an
adverse
employment
action
is
personally
acting
out
of
hostility
to
the
employee's
membership
in
or
obligation
to
a
uniformed
service,
a
motivating
factor
obviously
exists.
the
problem
we
confront
in
this
case
arises
when
that
official
has
no
discriminatory
animus,
as
buck
did
not,
but
is
influenced
by
previous
company
action
that
is
the
product
of
a
like
animus
in
someone
else
and
someone
else
who
is
an
agent
of
the
employer.
in
approaching
this
question,
we
start
from
the
premise
that
when
congress
creates
a
federal
tort,
it
adopts
the
background
of
general
tort
law.
intentional
torts
such
as
this,
as
distinguished
from
negligent
or
reckless
torts,
generally
require
that
the
actor
intend
the
consequences
of
an
act,
not
simply
the
act
itself.
proctor
contents
that
the
employer
is
not
liable
unless
the
de
facto
decisionmaker
rather
than
an
agent
on
whom
that
decisionmaker
relies
is
motivated
by
discriminatory
animus.
we
think
that
proposed
rule
is
overly
narrow.
animus
and
responsibility
for
the
adverse
action
can
both
be
--
can
both
be
attributed
to
the
earlier
agent
(here,
staub's
supervisors)
if
the
adverse
action
is
the
intended
consequence
of
that
agent's
discriminatory
conduct.
so
long
as
the
agent
intends,
for
discriminatory
reasons,
that
the
adverse
action
occur,
he
has
the
scienter
required
to
be
liable
under
userra.
and
--
and
his
scienter
can
be
attributed
to
his
employer
since
he
is
an
agent.
and
it
is
axi
--
axiomatic
under
tort
law,
that
the
exercise
of
judgment
by
the
decisionmaker
does
not
prevent
the
earlier
agent's
action
(and
hence
the
earlier
agent's
discriminatory
animus)
from
being
the
proximate
cause
of
the
harm.
proximate
cause
excludes
only
those
links
that
are
too
remote,
purely
contingent
or
indirect.
we
do
not
think
that
the
ultimate
decisionmaker's
exercise
of
judgment
automatically
renders
the
link
to
the
supervisor's
bias
"remote"
or
"purely
contingent."
moreover,
the
approach
urged
upon
us
by
proctor
gives
an
unlikely
meaning
to
a
provision
that
is
designed
to
prevent
employer
discrimination.
an
employer's
authority
to
reward,
punish
or
dismiss
is
often
allocated
among
multiple
agents.
the
one
who
makes
the
ultimate
decision
does
so,
on
the
basis
of
performance
assessments
by
other
supervisors.
proctor's
view
would
have
the
consequence
that
if
an
employer
isolates
a
personnel
official
from
an
employee's
supervisors,
vests
the
decision
to
take
adverse
employment
actions
in
that
official
alone,
and
asks
--
and
asks
that
official
to
review
the
employee's
personnel
file
before
taking
the
adverse
action,
then
the
employer
will
be
effectively
shielded
from
discriminatory
acts
and
recommendations
of
supervisors
that
were
designed
and
intended
to
produce
the
adverse
action.
that
seems
to
us
an
implausible
meaning
of
the
text,
and
one
that
is
not
compelled
by
its
words.
we
therefore
hold
that
if
a
supervisor
performs
an
act
motivated
by
antimilitary
animus
that
is
intended
by
the
supervisor
to
cause
an
adverse
employment
action,
and
if
that
act
is
a
proximate
cause
of
the
ultimate
employment
action,
then
the
employer
is
liable
under
userra.
applying
our
analysis
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
must
be
reversed.
there
was
evidence
that
mulally's
and
korenchuk's
actions
were
motivated
by
hostility
toward
staub's
military
obligations,
that
mulally's
and
korenchuk's
actions
caused
buck
to
fire
staub,
and
that
both
mulally
and
korenchuk
had
the
specific
intent
to
cause
staub
to
be
dis
--
to
be
dismissed.
whether
the
variance
between
the
jury
instruction
in
this
case
and
our
--
and
the
rule
we
announced
today
was
harmless
error
or
should
mandate
a
new
trial,
it
is
a
matter
that
the
seventh
circuit
may
consider
in
the
first
instance
on
remand.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
alito
has
filed
