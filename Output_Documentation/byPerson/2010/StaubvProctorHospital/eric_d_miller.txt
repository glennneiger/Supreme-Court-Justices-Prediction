mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
employer
is
liable
under
userra
when
a
supervisor
acting
with
a
discriminatory
motive
uses
a
delegated
authority
to
cause
an
adverse
employment
action.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
liability
does
not
attach
unless
that
supervisor
exerts
singular
influence
over
the
decisionmaker.
but
that
standard
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute
for
two
reasons.
first,
it's
incompatible
with
the
statutory
definition
of
"employer",
which
includes
not
just
the
ultimate
decisionmaker,
but
any
person
to
whom
the
employer
has
delegated
the
performance
of
significant
employment
responsibilities.
second,
it's
contrary
to
the
statute's
causation
standard,
which
requires
only
that
military
status
be
a
motivating
factor,
not
necessarily
a
singularly
important
factor
or
the
determinative
factor
in
the
adverse
employment
action.
now--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no.
there
is
two
separate
components
to
the
inquiry.
first
--
the
first
is
that
it
has
to
be
a
motivating
factor,
and
that
is
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
establish
in
order
to
make
a
prima
facie
case
under
section
4311(c).
and
then
there
is
an
affirmative
defense
if
the
employer
can
show
that
it
was
not
a
but-for
factor
in
the
sense
that,
you
know,
even
had
the
person
not
been
in
the
military
the
same
action
would
have
been
taken.
that's
the
--
if
the
employer
can
show
that,
then
it's
absolved
of
liability.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
in
our
view
the
"motivating
factor"
language
captures
the
idea
of
proximate
cause.
something
can
be
a
motivating
factor
if
it
is
one
of
many
factors,
but
in
our
view
it
does
need
to
be
more
than
a
trivial
or
de
minimus
factor
and
if
you
have
a
situation
where
the
bias
--
the
action
of
the
biased
supervisor
leads
through
a
long
and
improbable
and
unforeseeable
chain
of
causation
to
the
adverse
employment
action,
you
might
have
a
but-for
cause
but
you
wouldn't
have
proximate
cause
and
it
wouldn't
be
a
motivating
factor.
now,
this
case,
and
i
think
most
real
world
cases,
are
quite
different
from
that.
here
we
have
a
termination
decision
and
that
was
made
by
buck
on
the
basis
of
the
january
27th
warning
that
was
given
to
petitioner
and
the
report
that
petitioner
had
not
complied
with
that
warning.
and
both
parts
of
that,
the
warning
issued
by
mulally
and
the
report
of
noncompliance
that
came
from
korenchuk,
both
parts
of
that
the
jury
could
have
concluded
were--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
--
the
discriminatorily
motivated
actions
in
this
case,
the
evidence
interpreted
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
petitioner,
were
the
decision
of
mulally
to
write
up
petitioner
for
this
january
27th
incident,
and
that
was
motivated
by
her
hostility
to
him
because
of
his
status
in
the
army
reserves;
and
then
the
decision
of
korenchuk
to
report
that
he
had
violated
the
terms
of
that
january
27th
warning,
and
that
was
also
motivated
by
his
hostility
to
petitioner's
membership
in
the
--
in
the
army
reserves.
and
both
of
those
decisions
had
a
substantial
causal
role
in
the
--
in
the
ultimate
decision
made
by
the
employer
to
terminate.
and
because
both
of
those
people,
mulally
and
korenchuk--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
this
may
just
be
a
semantic
disagreement.
we
don't
think
it
has
to
be
substantial
in
the
sense
of
predominant.
it
can
be
one
of
--
there
can
be
many
factors
and
as
long
as
it's
one
of
them
that's
a
motivating
factor.
but
it
needs
to
be
substantial
in
the
sense
of
more
than
de
minimus
or
more
than
trivial,
something
that
the
employer
actually
took
into
account
as
one
of
the
reasons--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--there
would
still
be
liability
just
as
there
is
liability
in
the
situation,
which
is
quite
common,
where
an
employer
gives
a
single
official
the
authority
to
both
observe
an
employee's
behavior
and
make
a
decision
to
terminate.
if
that
single
official
is
biased,
and
makes
a
decision
on
the
basis
of
that
bias,
then
the
employer
is
going
to
be
liable
even
if
the
people
who
hired
that
official
tried
very
hard
to
make
sure
that
he
wasn't
biased.
and
that's
consistent
with--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--it
--
it
has
to
be
a
motivating
--
the
statute
says
a
motivating
factor
in
the
employer's
action.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
yes,
and
the
employer
--
the
employer
is
a
corporation,
and
it's
--
so
you
have
to
look
at
which
individuals
do
you
look
at
in
figuring
out
whether
it
was
a
motivating
factor
or
not,
and
the
statute
tells
us
that.
in
the
definition
of
4303
it
says
that
the
employer
includes
everyone
who
has
been
delegated
the
performance
of
employment-related
responsibilities.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
they--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--they
are
not
the
last
person
who
signs
the
piece
of
paper,
but
they
certainly
are
part
of
the
employer's--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--they
--
they
were
delegated
supervisory
responsibility
by
the
--
by
the
employer,
the
authority
to
observe
the
people
under
their
supervision,
to
evaluate
and
report
on
their
performance,
the
authority
to
initiate
disciplinary
proceedings.
and
they
used
that
authority
in
a
discriminatory
manner
and
that,
that
conduct
by
them,
was
a
substantial
causal
factor
in
the
--
in
the
ultimate
action
of
discharge.
and
given
the
--
the
statutory
definition
of
employer
and
the
motivating
factor
causation
standard,
that's
enough
under
the
statute
for
--
for
liability.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
no,
even
though,
as
you
say,
in
a
sense
there
would
be
but-for
causation.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
but
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
under
any
standard
of
proximate
causation,
and
not
--
the
initial
discriminatory
discipline
or
warning
would
not
be
a
motivating
or
substantial
factor
in
the
ultimate
decision
to
fire
him.
he
is
being
fired
because
of
the
intervening
cause,
but--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--some
independent
intervening
cause.
now,
in
this
case
we
don't
have
anything
like
that.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
independent
of
the
employer.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
number
of
people,
all
of
whom
are
agents
of
the
same
employer.
so
under
traditional
principles
of
--
of
an
intervening
cause,
one
can't
say
that
any
one
of
those
agents
of
the
employer
was
an
intervening
cause
that
broke
the
chain
of
causation
from
misconduct
of
the
other
agent
of
the
employer.
you
have
a
series
of
agents
of
the
same
employer
engaging
in
a
course
of
conduct
that
at
the
beginning
of
which
is
an
unlawfully
--
unlawful
discriminatory
motive
that
leads
to
the
termination.
that's
quite
different
from
the
employee
deciding
to
start
a
fire
or
engage
in
some
sort
of
misconduct
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
military
status.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
it
is
not,
i
think
it
--
one
would
hope
it
is
not
a
foreseeable
result
of
discipline
given
to
an
employee
that
he
would
then
start
a
fire.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
one
would
not
normally
think
that,
even
if
it's
less
extreme
than
starting
a
fire,
that
a
course
of
misconduct
by
the
employee
is
a
foreseeable
result
of
a
discriminatory--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
yes.
