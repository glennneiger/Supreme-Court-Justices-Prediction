mr.
roy
g.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
parties
to
this
case
are
in
total
agreement
with
respect
to
two
points.
the
first
point
is
that
linda
buck
made
the
decision
to
fire
vincent
staub.
and
the
second
point
is,
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
linda
buck
possessed
animus
towards
mr.
staub
on
account
of
his
service
in
the
reserve.
applying
ordinary
tort-related
vicarious
liability
rules,
staub's
case
against
proctor
hospital
would
end
right
here.
but
the
seventh
circuit,
applying
what
it
calls
the
"cat's
paw"
doctrine,
gives
staub
and
all
other
plaintiffs
like
him
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
right.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
think
in
that
situation,
consistent
with
the
"cat's
paw"
analysis,
with
the
facts
that
you
set
up,
the
two
supervisors
so
dominated
her
decision
that
there
would
be
likely
a
finding
that
the
case
goes
to
the
jury.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
but
there
being
no
other
input
whatsoever
beyond
that,
there
still
is
the
domination
issue.
if
i
change
your
hypothetical
just
a
little
bit
and
say
that
all
of
what
you
said
is
true,
but
in
addition
to
that
the
fellow
who
got
fired
has
a
10-year
history
of
being
late
and
she
looked
at
that
history,
i
think
that
she's
now
made
an
independent
decision,
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
therefore
under
the
seventh
circuit's
rule
no
liability
attaches
and
that's
the
right
result.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
think
that
is
what
the
jury
has
to
decide,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
case
in
the
latter
extended
hypothetical
gets
that
far.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
disagree
with
that
a
little
bit.
i
don't
think
if
she
engaged
in
any
investigation
that
absolves
of
liability.
i
think
if
she
engages
in
a
good
faith
investigation
it
absolves
of
liability.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
right.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
will
answer
that.
before
i
get
to
that,
i
disagree
with
the
point
about
he
wasn't
given
an
opportunity
to
explain.
i
think
the
record
is
clear
he
was
given
an
opportunity
to
explain.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
at
the
--
two
times.
at
the
time
he
was
discharged,
on
the
day
that
korenchuk
brings
him
in,
korenchuk
says:
"i
was
looking
for
you
and
couldn't
find
you.
"
and
in
the
record,
in
fact,
staub
gave
an
explanation
of
his
whereabouts.
buck
was
there.
she
heard
it.
the
second
time
is,
approximately
5
days
later,
he
files
a
five-page
long
grievance
stating
all--
mr.
roy
g.
davis
--i
think
the
record
shows
he
did
give
an
explanation
of
his
whereabouts.
the
record
also
shows
that
he
filed
a
five-page
grievance
contesting
that
action.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
after
he
was
fired.
and
that
buck
carefully
investigated
that
and
5
days
after
it
was
filed
gave
him
a
letter
saying:
i
have
looked
into
it,
i
have
considered
all
your
arguments,
including
your
argument
that
you
were
discharged
on
account
of
your
military
service,
but
i
don't
credit
it.
and
therefore,
i'm
sustaining
the
discharge.
and
that
is
absolutely
--
mr.
staub
knew
that
that
works
for
him,
because
in
1998
he
invoked
the
same
procedure
when
he
was
discharged
the
first
time
for
similar
reasons
and
he
was
conditionally
reinstated
to
employment
at
proctor
hospital.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
do
agree
with
it.
the
mr.
staub
and
others
like
him
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
but
he
has
to
demonstrate
that
the
person
who
possessed
animus
exercised
so
much
control
over
the
decisionmaker
that
that
person
became
the
true
decisionmaker.
and
that
simply
doesn't
work
in
this
case
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
the
answer
to
that
is,
the
statute
sets
forth
five
factors,
four
or
five
factors,
and
says
that
one
of
the
four
or
five
employment
actions
has
to
be
a
motivating
factor
in
arriving
at
the
decision.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
okay.
it's
4311(a).
and
it
says--
mr.
roy
g.
davis
--from
the
third
line
--
well,
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
tell
you
what
line
it
is.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
it
says
that
there
are
five
actions
that
are
prohibited:
denial
of
initial
employment,
reemployment,
retention
in
employment,
promotion,
or
any
benefit
of
employment.
and
it
says
that
an
employer
cannot
take
action,
one
of
those
actions,
on
the
basis
of
four
factors:
membership,
application
for
membership,
performance,
service
--
or
service
of
obligation
in
the
uniformed
services.
so
there
has
to
be
something
to
connect
one
of
those
factors
to
one
of
those
five
actions.
and
that's
the
literal
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
the
seventh
circuit's
view
is
absolutely
consistent
with
that.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
correct.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
that
the
subordinate's
motivation
is
imputed
actually
to
the
decisionmaker,
and
ultimately
to
the
employer.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
well,
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
case,
your
honor,
it
is
not,
because
the
definition
of
"employer"
here
not
only
includes
proctor
hospital,
what
you
might
call
the
ultimate
employer,
but
it
also
includes
the
person
who
made
the
adverse
employment
decision.
and
in
this
case,
it's
linda
buck.
and
this
statute
creates
personal
liability
for
ms.
buck
or
anybody
else
who
makes
a
decision
if
it's
based
on
one
of
these
factors
contained
in
the
statute.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
way
a
jury
would
be
allowed
to
consider
whether
or
not
ms.
buck
is
in
violation
of
the
statute
because
there
is
an
absolute
dearth
of
evidence
that
any
of
these
factors
motivated
the
decision
she
made.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
agree.
it
is
hers
to
the
extent
that
she
makes
a
good
faith
investigation
into
the
background
facts.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
and
in
this
case,
she
is
acting
on
an
awful
lot
of
information.
they
pick
out--
mr.
roy
g.
davis
--okay.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
that
would
lead
to
a
never-ending
chain
of
looking
backwards
all
the
time
over
the
course
of
perhaps
a
very
long
employment
history
to
scour
the
record
to
determine,
is
there
one
single
or
two
single
actions
out
there
that
may
somehow
have
come
forward
and
caused
this
termination?
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i'm
not
sure
i
thoroughly
understand
the
hypothetical,
but
if
the
true
decisionmaker
there
comes
forward
and
says,
i
didn't
know
about
this,
i
didn't
rely
upon
it,
i
don't
think
that
the
animus
can
be
imputed
to
the
decisionmaker.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
don't
think--
mr.
roy
g.
davis
--right.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
correct.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
no
consideration
of
proximate
cause,
either.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
because
to
motivate
--
to
be
motivated
by
one
of
these
factors,
there
has
to
be
some
element
of
proximate
causation.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
think
that--
mr.
roy
g.
davis
--i
think
that
that
is
the
seventh
circuit's
way
of
saying
proximate
cause.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
think
you
could
say
that.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
and
i
agree
with
that,
and
we
get
back
to
the
notion
that
in
this
case,
it
was
ms.
buck
who
made
the
decision.
she
made
the--
mr.
roy
g.
davis
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
only
on
one
respect.
he
received
a
technical
"very
good",
but
with
respect
to
the
narrative
portion
of
that
evaluation
it
says:
"i
want
you
to
stay
in
the
department
when
you
are
being
paid
to
work
and
not
to
be
out
wandering
around.
"
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
don't
think
we
know
the
answer
to
that.
it
was--
mr.
roy
g.
davis
--yes.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
and
in
b,
the
employer
could
not
be
liable.
in
b
the
person
who
made
the
decision,
the
employer,
was
not
motivated
by
one
of
the
factors
in
the
statute;
that
person
couldn't
be
liable.
if
that
person
can't
be
liable,
how
can
that
employer
of
that
person
be
vicariously
liable?
i
don't
think
they
can.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
oh,
no.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
disagree
on
that.
a
corporation
can
only
act
through
its
agents.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
have
listened
to
the
hypothetical
long
enough
that
i
have
lost
track
of
who
made
the
decision
to
fire
him.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
thank
you.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
as
i
understand
it,
the
second
person
in
the
hypothetical
had
no
motivation
whatsoever
under
the
statute
to
cause
the
discharge
and
therefore
the
employer
wouldn't
be
liable
for
that
decision.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
normally
you
would
give
weight
to
the
government's
position,
but
i
think
the
government's
position
has
to
be
consistent
with
the
precise
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
there
can
be
a
charge
filed
with
the
secretary
of
labor,
which
the
secretary
of
labor
would
then
investigate.
the
secretary
of
labor
has
the
option
to
bring
an
action
should
the
secretary
choose
to
do
so.
but
coterminously,
the
individual
service
person
can
bring
an
independent
cause
of
action,
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
in
this
case
there
was
no
secretary
of
labor
involvement.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
think
that
the
problem
with
this
situation
is,
is
that
one
of
the
actors
here,
the
decision
that
she
made,
being
mulally,
and
that's
with
respect
to
whom
the
most
evidence
of
animus
was
adduced,
didn't
commit
an
action
that
would
be
actionable
under
userra.
there
--
there
is
no
way
that
issuing
the
constructive
advice
record
on
january
27
violated
the
statute,
even
if
it
was
motivated
by
animus.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
sure.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
the
instruction
may
have
been
somewhat
protective,
but
the
problem
is,
prior
to
issuing
that
instruction
the
district
court
did
no
analysis
whatsoever
to
determine
if
the
instruction
was
warranted
in
the
first
place,
and
that
was
simply
our
point
to
the
seventh
circuit.
before
you
allow
this
to
fall
into
the
lap
of
a
jury
and
try
and
explain
to
a
jury,
as
opposed
to
the
supreme
court,
what
it
means
to
be
a
"cat's
paw"
in
the
agency
theory,
the
district
court
should
at
least
make
an
initial
determination
that
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
i
believe
that
is
the
only
thing
with
--
there
may
be
a
section
later
on,
your
honor,
in
the
regs
that
deals
with--
mr.
roy
g.
davis
--that
is
certainly
the
commentary
that
goes
with
it.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
ms.
buck
would
have
said:
i
let
him
go
because
he
has
this
veritable
tsunami
of
bad
behaviors,
what
he
is
accused
of
is
absolutely
consistent
with
it,
and
i
made
the
decision.
is
it
a
truthful
statement
by
her?
it
is
absolutely
a
truthful
statement
by
her,
and
that
was
the
reason
for
her
actions.
i
think
ms.
buck's
consideration
of
the
discharge
decision
wasn't
limited
to
one
source.
it
clearly
was
not.
no
one
shaped
or
directed
the
scope
of
her
determination.
even
more
important,
she
gave
mr.
staub
the
opportunity
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story.
and
after
considering
all
that,
she
decided
that
his
discharge
was
warranted.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
right.
mr.
roy
g.
davis
again,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
record
says
--
and
i
apologize,
i
can't
quote
it
from
the
page
--
that
in
fact
mr.
staub
protested
that
what
he
was
accused
of,
i.e.,
not
being
where
he
was
supposed
to
be,
was
wrong.
and
he
stated
his
version
of
it.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
