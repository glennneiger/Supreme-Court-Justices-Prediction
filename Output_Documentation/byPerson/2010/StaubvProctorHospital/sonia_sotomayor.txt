isn't
that
--
the
government's
formulation
that
the
discrimination
has
to
play
a
substantial
role
in
the
termination
a
limiting
principle?
i
mean,
you
answered
or
appeared
to
be
answering
justice
alito
that
in
a
10-year
history
if
one
report
of
discrimination
existed
that
that
would
shift
the
burden
to
the
employer.
is
that
an
accurate
statement
of
law?
that
one
report
has
to
play
a
role
that
is
more
than
a
mere
existence,
doesn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
than
the
sg?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it
has
to
have
some
materiality
to
the
decision.
i
mean,
it
has
to
have
--
it
has
to
play
not
just
any
role.
it
has
to
play
a
material
role
in
the
decision,
no?
or
--
they
use
"substantial".
it
could
be
"material".
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
using
proximate
cause
in
but-for,
or
are
you
suggesting
a
different
formulation
of
causation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
that
formulation
as
you've
just
articulated,
where
do
you
place
your
test
of
a
subordinate
setting
in
motion
and
playing
a
substantial
role?
what
does
that
test
that
you
proposed
in
your
brief
--
how
does
it
fit
into
this?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
--
petitioner's
counsel
argues
that
there
is
no
issue
of
--
in
the
motivating
factor
test,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
substantial
role;
it
just
has
to
be
a
motivating
factor,
so
that
the
subordinates--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
look
at
the
hypothetical.
take
it
out
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
there
are
two
supervisors,
each
of
them
have
anti-military
animus,
and
they
both
report
that
this
gentleman
was
late
when
he
wasn't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
absolutely
a
falsehood.
they
go
in,
they
report
it
to
miss
buck.
miss
buck
does
an
investigation.
there
are
no
witnesses.
there
is
no
one
else
to
prove
that
they
came
in
late.
she
just
takes
the
supervisors'
word.
she
looks
at
their
report
moments
after
the
employee
didn't
show
up,
and
she
says:
he's
a
late-goer.
i
don't
know
anything
about
anti-animus;
i
simply
fired
him
because
two
supervisors
who
are
trustworthy,
i've
looked
at
their
files,
they've
never
lied
about
anything
before,
they
are
pretty
honest
people.
what
happens
in
that
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how?
she
went
and
looked
for
witnesses,
didn't
find
them.
she
looked
at
their
records.
she
did
--
what
happened
here;
other
people
have
complained
about
these
people,
don't
particularly
like
them.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
the
question.
you
just
added
a
very
important
fact,
which
is
a
10-year
history
of
being
late.
but
on
this
day
he
wasn't
late.
on
this
day
the
two
supervisors
made
it
up.
would
she
have
fired
him
absent
that
report?
isn't
that
what
the
jury
has
to
decide?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
what
this
circuit's
"cat's
paw"
theory
does
and
what
others
do
say,
if
she
engaged
in
any
investigation
there's
no
liability.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
assumes
that
the
employment
decision
is
solely
hers.
it's
hers,
not
based
on
her
peccadilloes;
it's
hers
based
on
the
information
that
she
has
gathered.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
--
but
she's
not
acting
in
a
vacuum.
she's
acting
on
information
that
has
been
supplied
to
her
by
people
who
are
authorized
to
supply
that
to
her
in
the
employment
context.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
are
now
talking
past
the
individual
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
am
talking
about
just
the
legal
analysis,
which
is:
she
is
a
decisionmaker,
but
there
are
multiple
actors
on
behalf
of
the
employer.
that's
your
adversary's
position
--
or
participating
in
the
process.
and
they
are
saying
if
any
of
those
actors
in
the
process
has
been
delegated
employment
duties
that
permit
them
to
participate
in
this
way,
then
if
what
motivates
them
is
bias
of
this
kind,
then
the
employer
is
responsible,
not
just
for
ms.
buck's
activities,
but
for
the
two
supervisors'
discriminatory
activities.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
in
most
situations
an
employer
comes
in
and
says:
i
fired
x
for
x,
y,
and
z
reasons.
and
if
they
don't
mention
one
of
those
inconsequential
or
immaterial
reports,
why
would
a
court
rely
on
it
at
all?
it's
not
a
motivating
factor.
