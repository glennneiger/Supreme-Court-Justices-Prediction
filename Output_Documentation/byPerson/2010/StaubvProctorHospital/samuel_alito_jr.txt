justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
before
we
jump
to
agency
law,
shouldn't
we
take
a
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
statute
says
that
a
prima
facie
case
is
made
out
if
it
is
shown
that
military
service,
anti-military
animus,
was
a
motivating
factor
in
the
employer's
action.
the
employer's
action
here
was
discharge,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
word
"motivate"
means
to
provide
someone
with
a
motive
to
do
something,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
person
who
did
something
here
was
the
person
who
discharged,
discharged
mr.
staub,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
why
doesn't
it
follow
that
the
motivation
that
is
relevant
under
the
statute
is
the
motivation
of
the
person
who
--
who
performs
the
action
that
is
challenged?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
the
--
what
is
--
what
is
made
illegal
are
certain
employer
actions,
right?
not
everything
that's
done,
not
--
just
writing
up
a
bad
report
for
a
biased
reason
is
not
actionable
under
this
statute;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
just
ask
where
--
could
i
ask
where
your
argument
leads?
let's
say
that
an
employer
calls
in
an
employee
and
says:
now,
we
have
to
decide
who
to
lay
off,
and
we
have
looked
at
your
record
over
the
last
10
years,
and
here
it
is,
all
the
evaluations
you've
gotten
over
the
past
10
years,
and
based
on
all
of
that,
we
--
we've
decide
that
you
are
going
to
be
the
person
to
be
laid
off.
now
if
it
turns
out
that
one
of
those
evaluations
was
rendered
by
someone
who
had
an
anti-military
bias,
would
that
make
the
employee
--
would
that
be
a
prima
facie
case
against
the
employer?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
--
even
if
the
employer
at
that
time
did
every
--
made
every
reasonable
effort
to
investigate
the
validity
of
all
the
prior
evaluations,
still
the
employer
would
be
on
the
hook?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
isn't
what
the
statute
says.
you
jump
over
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
has
to
be
a
motivating
factor
in
the
decision
to
discharge.
and
that
speaks
--
that
looks
natural
--
the
natural
reading
of
that
is
that
it
looks
at
the
motivation
of
the
person
who
actually
makes
the
decision
to
discharge.
now,
i'm
not
suggesting
that's
the
right
rule.
that's
a
very
unattractive
rule.
but
the
rule
that
you
have
suggested
is
also
a
very
unattractive
rule,
one
that
i
doubt
the
congress
intended
to
adopt.
is
there
no
reasonable
middle
position
here?
it's
all
or
nothing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
happens
in
the
situation
where
a
prior
evaluation
or
some
disciplinary
action
does
have
a
substantial
effect
on
the
decision
that's
--
the
employment
decision
that's
made,
but
the
employer
has
no
notice
that
the
prior
evaluation
or
disciplinary
action
was
based
on
a
biased
ground,
or
any
reasonable
way
of
finding
out
that
it
was
based
on
a
biased
ground?
what
happens
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
you
get
around
the
statutory
language
that
says
that
the
motivating,
it
has
to
be
a
motivating
factor
in
the
--
in
the
action
that
is
challenged?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
employer's
action
here
is
--
is
discharge.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
but
those
other
people
--
everybody
who
has
been
delegated
authority
under
the
--
by
the
employer
are
not
--
is
not
involved
in
the
action
that's
challenged--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--does
not
take
the
action
of
this
challenge.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
maybe
then
the
test
is
whether
they
were
delegated
some
of
the
responsibility
for
the
challenged
action,
were
they
delegated
responsibility
for
making
the
discharge
decision.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
that
the
standard
for
employer
liability
is
different
under
this
statute
than
under
other
federal
antidiscrimination
statutes?
is
that
what
you
were
just
suggesting?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
we
were
to
hold
here
that
the
vii
or
under
the
adea
or
under
the
ada?
