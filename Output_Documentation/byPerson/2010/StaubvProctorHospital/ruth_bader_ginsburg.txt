there
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
is
this
defense
for
the
employer
that,
no
matter
that
there
was
this
ill
will,
there
was
enough
else
to
warrant
termination
of
this
employee.
and
so
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
it
--
wouldn't
the
employer's
defense
simply
be:
anyone
who
starts
a
fire
goes?
that's
--
that's
a
--
it
would
have
happened
no
matter
what
the
reason
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
just
comes
under
the
employer's
defense
as
showing
that
the
same
action
would
have
been
taken.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
it
--
what
was
it
here?
because
when
--
what
was
his
name
--
korenchuk?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--takes
him
into
buck's
office
and
buck
hands
him
the
pink
slip
and
says,
"you're
fired",
that
the
jury
could
have
credited
that
evidence.
he
was
given
no
opportunity
to
explain
the
situation.
what
kind
of
investigation?
what
--
she
looked
at
his
personnel
file.
what
else
was
the
investigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
after
he
got
his
pink
slip.
what
--
what
point
--
when
korenchuk
takes
him
into
--
takes
staub
into
buck's
office,
according
to
his
testimony,
which
the
jury
could
credit,
he
wasn't
asked
a
thing.
she
just
said:
here's
your
pink
slip;
you're
fired.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
after
he
was
fired.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
do
agree
with
the
seventh
circuit's
"cat's
paw"
approach
to
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
--
let's
look
at
the
statutory
factors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
where
are
you
reading
it
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
ms.
buck
never
would
have
made
this
decision
if
korenchuk
hadn't
come
in
and
said:
here's
staub,
he's
goofing
off;
he
was
told
to
tell
me
when
he
was
going
to
be
absent,
and
he
didn't.
korenchuk,
who
has
the
absent
--
is
a
motivating
factor
certainly
in
what
happened
to
mr.
staub,
because
if
you
didn't
have
mr.
korenchuk
marching
staub
into
buck's
office
he
would
have
retained
his
job.
wasn't
his
last
--
his
most
recent
performance
rating
very
good?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
case,
there
was
no
indication,
apart
from
korenchuk's
coming
in,
that
buck
would
have
taken
any
adverse
action
against
staub.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
your
position
is
--
it
coincides
with
the
seventh
circuit,
but
it
is
in
opposition
to
the
secretary
of
labor's
commentary
on
how
this
works.
the
secretary
of
labor's
commentary
is
it's
a
motivating
factor,
and
if
korenchuk
precipitates
this
whole
thing,
that's
a
motivating
factor.
do
we
--
i
mean,
this
is
the
secretary
of
labor
administers
the
statute.
do
we
give
any
weight
to
the
government's
official
position
on
what
a
motivating
factor
means?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
a
jury
find
from
the
testimony
before
--
before
it,
that
at
the
time
he
received
his
pink
slip
--
let's
not
talk
about
the
grievance
after--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--at
the
time
he
got
the
grievance
slip,
he
was
not
given
any
opportunity
to
explain
that
this
charge
was
not
warranted,
that
he
had
tried
to
reach
korenchuk
on
the
phone
to
tell
him,
we
are
going
to
lunch,
and
was
unable
to.
he
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
say
that
to
ms.
buck.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schnapper,
is
that
your
recollection
of
this
record,
too,
that
he
did
state
his
version
before
he
got
the
pink
slip?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
title
vii
be
different?
