mr.
eric
schnapper
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
dismissal
of
an
employee
is
often
the
result
of
the
interrelated
actions
and
decisions
of
several
officials.
whether
an
employer
is
legally
responsible
for
any
particular
official
and
his
or
her
actions
and
decisions
turns
on
agency
law.
congress
legislates
against
a
background
of
agency
law
and
is
presumed
to
have
intended
agency
principles
to
govern
that
kind
of
question.
agency
law,
not
the
eleventh
circuit's
"cat's
paw"
doctrine,
is
the
controlling
standard
here.
there
are
two
principal
agency
doctrines
on
which
liability
can
be
based.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
sir.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
that's
not
the--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
there
is
a
--
there
are
a
series
of
actions
and
decisions
that
yield
this
result.
and
the
reference
in
the
statute
is
to
the
actions
of
the
employer,
not
to
any
particular
official.
and
so--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--that's
correct.
but
a
decision
to
--
the
decision
to
dismiss
an
official
is
--
can
be,
and
is
here,
the
result,
cumulative
result,
of
a
series
of
decisions.
it's
not
unlike
what
occurs
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
only
a
sentencing
judge
can
send
a
defendant
to
prison,
but
that
decision
actually
is
a
result
of
a
series
of
other
decisions,
all
of
which
are
government
action.
we
think--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
our
standard
is
not
whether
it's
a
supervisor,
but
whether
it's
an
official
for
whom
the
employer
is
liable
under
agency
law.
that
would
not
be
every
supervisor.
if
a
supervisor
unrelated
to
this
particular
department
put
a
false
charge
in
a
suggestion
box,
that
wouldn't
be
any
different.
ordinarily,
a
coworker
wouldn't
qualify
under
agency
principles
as
an
agent
of
the
employer
when
engaging
in
that
conduct.
you
have
to
look
at
the
specific
conduct
and
apply
the
traditional
agency
standards.
they
are
laid
out,
for
example,
in
the
court's
decision
in
ellerth,
which
refers
to
the
two
branches
of
agency
law:
scope
of
employment,
and
action
which
is
aided
in,
where
the
actor
was
aided
in
the
conduct
by
his
or
her
official
position.
and
i
think
those
principles
would
not
ordinarily
apply
to
a
coworker,
but
they
would
also
not
apply
invariably
to
a
supervisor.
this
is
not
--
we
are
not
advocating
the
supervisor
versus
non-supervisor
distinction
in
ellerth,
but
a
return
to
just
the
traditional
agency
doctrines.
and
we
think
those
doctrines
delineate
who
is
the
employer
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
which
bans
action
by
the
employer.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
they
had
other
authorities.
they
had
--
well,
there
are
two
doctrines.
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
it's
--
it's
the
core
responsibility
of
--
in
terms
of
scope
of
employment.
it's
the
core
responsibility
of
a
supervisor
of
a
particular
individual
to
be
monitoring
his
or
her
behavior,
reporting
on
it,
perhaps
initiating
disciplinary
matters
--
measures.
that
wouldn't
be
true
of
all
supervisors.
it's
only
true
of
mr.
staub's
supervisors.
so
--
what
--
the
kind
of
thing
they
did
was
the
kind
of
work
that
they
were
employed
to
engage
in,
and
that
distinguishes
them
from,
say,
another
supervisor
who
might
slip
a
note
into
a
suggestion
box.
second,
the
other
branch,
major
branch,
of
agency
law
is
that
an
employer
is
liable
for
actions
of
individuals
when
their
conduct
--
when
they
are
aided
in
their
conduct
by
their
official
position,
which
would
not
typically
be
true
of
a
fellow
worker.
but
that
could
be
true
here.
for
example,
mulally
set
much
of
this
in
motion
when,
on
the
plaintiff's
version
of
the
facts,
she
issued
the
january
27th
corrective
order.
everyone
agrees
she
wrote
it.
she
signed
it.
she
was
aided
in
doing
that
by
her
position
as
a
supervisor.
a
coworker
couldn't
do
that.
and
indeed,
somebody
else's
supervisor
couldn't
have
done
that.
so--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--it
would.
but
the
affirmative--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
or
in
the
common
law
that
creates
a
special
rule
for
thorough
investigation.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it's--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--respondeat
--
respondeat
superior
is
absolute
liability.
there
is
no
due
diligence
exception.
if
you
look
to
section
219
of
the
restatement
of
agency,
219
part
2(b)
provides
for
liability
based
on
negligence,
but
part
2(d),
regardless
of
whether
there
is
negligence,
provides
liability
if
you're
added
in
your
--
aided
in
your
conduct
by
the
--
by
your
position.
now,
it's
possible,
depending
on
the
exact
facts,
that
the
situation
you
described
wouldn't
fit
into
scope
of
employment
or
aided
in.
if
you
just
had
two
people
whose
only
role
was
just
as
witnesses,
then
they're
not
acting
as
agents,
they
are
just
witnesses,
perhaps.
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
there
is
no--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
it's
the
language
of
section
4311(c)(1)
that
is
critical
here.
the
statute
provides
that
if
an
improper
motive
was
a
motivating
factor
there
is
a
defense.
but
there
is
only
one
defense,
and
the
defense
is
a
showing
the
employer
would
have
fired
the
plaintiff
anyway.
the
language
is
mandatory.
it
says
if
the
defense
is
not
made
out,
the
employer
shall
be
considered
to
have
violated
the
statute.
but
the
clearest
enunciation
of
the
error
in
the
seventh
circuit
is
the
language
at
page
47
of
the
joint
appendix
where
the
court
says:
without
regard
to
the
jury
verdict
here,
the
employer
is
off
the
hook
if
the
decisionmaker
did
her
own
investigation.
that's
an
additional
defense.
and
it's
simply
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
now,
that
may
not
have
been
--
that
may
have
been
harsh,
but
it's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
that
the
kind
of
circumstances
that
the
court
has
pointed
to
would
be
at
the
remedy
stage.
the
remedies
are
discretionary
and,
whereas
4311(c)(1)
says
4323
in
describing
all
the
remedies
says
"may".
and
so
a
court
could
take
those
things
into
account
in
framing
a
remedy.
and
certainly
the
good
faith
efforts
of
someone
in
buck's
position,
for
example,
would
be
relevant
to
a
determination
of
whether
a
violation
was
willful.
and
that
in
fact
reflects
what
happened
in
this
case,
which
is
that
the
jury
found
that
there
was
a
violation
--
found
that
the
--
the
motivations
involved
here
included
an
improper
motivation,
rejected
the
4311(c)(1)
defense,
but
then
found
the
violation
wasn't
willful.
so
i
think,
given
the
structure
of
the
statute,
the
play
here,
the
ability
to
adjust
to
those
circumstances,
is
in
the
remedy
provision,
not
in
the
mandatory
language
of
the
4311(c)(1).
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
in
that
regard
i
think
we
would
articulate
the
standard
differently.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
the
language
in
the
statute
is
not
a
substantial
motivating
factor.
it's
a
motivating
factor.
and
that
choice
of
language
is
clearly
deliberate.
this
whole
--
this
language
in
this
provision
derives
from
this
court's
decision
in
price
waterhouse--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--if
i
could
go
back
to
price
waterhouse
and
explain
how
we
got
to
this
language.
it
was
a
sharply
divide
opinion.
the
plurality
standard
of
justice
brennan
said
"a
motivating
factor".
justice
white's
standard
was
"a
substantial
motivating
factor".
justice
o'connor's
standard
was
"substantial".
justice
kennedy
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
that
was
going
to
lead
to
fights
about
how
much
was
enough
to
be
substantial.
when
congress
then
wrote
the
1991
civil
rights
act,
from
which
this
language
derives,
amending
title
vii
they
used
the
brennan
language,
"a
motivating
factor".
they
didn't
use
"substantial"
and
i
think
that
was
clearly
deliberate.
anyone
who
read
price
waterhouse
--
and
that
provision
was
written
about
price
waterhouse
--
would
have
understood
that
that
was
a
difference
within
the
court
and
they
made
that
choice.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
not
our
position,
justice
scalia.
our
position
is
that,
with
regard
to
the
liability
determination
in
4311,
that
any
motivating
factor
is
what
is
required.
if
you
have
a
number
of
different
officials
involved,
buck
and
mulally
and
korenchuk,
if
anyone
who
played
a
role
in
this
had
an
unlawful
motive
that
satisfies
4311(c)(1)
and
the
burden
shifts
to
the
employer
to
show
it
would
have
done
the
same
thing
anyway.
willfulness
doesn't
have
that
same
language
about
a
motivating
factor.
it
just
asks
whether
the
employer's
violation
was
willful.
this
court's
decision
about
willfulness
in
thurston
and
hazen
paper
i
think
are
broad
enough
to
encompass
a
situation
where
you
had
several
different
officials.
and
if
i
might--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--it's
our
view
that
the
language
of
the
statute
permits
that
distinction
because
of
the
discretionary
nature
of
the
remedy
provision
as
opposed
to
the
mandatory
nature
of
4311(c)(1).
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
it's
somewhat
unclear
what
happened.
it's
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
defendant's
account
of
why
he
was
fired
has
changed.
one,
the
written
explanation
was
that
he
never
obeyed
the
rule
for
the
3
months
it
was
in
effect.
the
explanation
given
by
buck
was
that
she
had
been
told
that
he
wasn't
--
couldn't
have
been
found
on
the
19th.
the
story
that
was
given
to
staub
at
the
time
was
that
korenchuk
couldn't
find
him
on
the
20th,
so
if
he
was
responding
to
that
he
was
responding
to
the
wrong
question.
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
those
aren't
the
versions
in
the
written
record
at
the
time.
the
written
record
at
the
time
says
he
is
fired
because
he
has
been
breaking
this
rule
ever
since
january.
nobody
claims
that's
true.
if
i
--
we
--
a
number
of
questions,
i
think
particularly
justice
alito
asked
whether
congress
would
have
intended
the
result
in
this
case.
we
don't
think
it's
as
harsh
as
you
do,
but
we
think
that
the
intent
is
particularly
clear
here.
section
4301(1)
says
the
purpose,
the
codified
purpose,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
minimize
the
disadvantages
to
civilian
careers
that
can
result
from
service
in
the
military.
and
that
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
read
--
you
have
to
read
the
rest
of
the
statute.
secondly,
this
userra
is
unique
among
employment
statutes
or
close
to
it,
because
the
employer
has
an
economic
incentive
to
break
the
law.
it's
expensive
to
keep
reservists
on
the
books.
and
mulally
and
korenchuk
objected
to
staub
working
there
precisely
because
it
cost
them
more
money
when
he
went
to
drill,
and
it
cost
them
more
money
when
he
was
called
up
for
operation
iraqi
freedom.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
there
are
particularly
compelling
textual
reasons
for
the
position
we
are
urging
here,
other
statutes
have
different
language.
you
might
decide
this
case--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
we
think
that
would
be
wrong
for
some
of
the
reasons
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
but
you
could
write
an
opinion
that
only
addressed
it
under
userra
and
left
those
other
questions
open.
mr.
eric
schnapper
of
the
language
in
title
vii
is
similar
to
4311(c)(1),
but
the
language
that
i
just
read
about
the
purpose
isn't
in
title
vii.
so
you
could
decide
this
case
on
somewhat
narrower
grounds
and
not
reach
every
situation.
the
--
the
interpretation
of
userra
adopted
by
the
seventh
circuit
creates
a
serious
loophole
in
the
statute.
as
a
number
of
the
amici
have
pointed
out,
the
amici
on
the
other
side,
employers
typically
make
a
disciplinary
decision
as
a
result
of
a
bunch
of
different
decisions.
the
seventh
circuit
holds
that
so
long
as
the
employer
divides
up
those
responsibilities,
userra
will
not
apply
to
many
of
the
decisions.
on
their
view,
but
userra
applies
only
to
what
the
last
decisionmaker
did.
and
the
narrower
her
role,
the
narrower
the
protections
of
the
statute.
this
statute
should
not
be
read
in
that
way.
not
only
because
of
the
language
that
i
have
recounted,
but
because
userra,
it's
reemployment
rights
and
it's
anti-discrimination
rights
play
an
essential
role
in
the
national
defense.
they
safeguard
the
livelihood
of
men
and
women
who
safeguard
the
nation.
and
congress
wouldn't
have
wanted
that
statute
read
wrong.
