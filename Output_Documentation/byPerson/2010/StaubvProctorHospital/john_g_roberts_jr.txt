chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
afternoon
in
case
09-400,
staub
v.
proctor
hospital.
mr.
schnapper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
schnapper.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
regard
--
is
that
the
same
as
a
but-for
cause,
motivating
factor?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
a
situation
where
a
particular
procedure
such
as
the
one
here
is
set
up
for
a
discriminatory
reason,
and
the
employee
is
really
upset
with
that,
and
so
he,
you
know,
starts
a
fire
in
the
plant?
wouldn't
have
had
--
wouldn't
have
set
the
fire
if
not
for
the
discriminatory
purpose.
now
does
he
have
a
cause
of
action
in
that
case
when
he
is
fired
for
setting
--
setting
the
office
on
fire?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
do
accept
that
the
traditional
doctrine
of
an
intervening
cause
is
applicable
in
this?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
what
--
what
independent
intervening
cause--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i'm
sorry
--
but
i
think
the
end
there
just
kind
of
glided
over
the
whole
issue.
you
say
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
military
status.
it
has
to
do
with
a
procedure
that
was
set
up
because
the
employer
was
discriminating
against
him
because
of
his
military
status.
so
it
certainly
had
something
to
do
with
his
military
status.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
the
hypothetical
is
extreme
to
try
to
flesh
out
your
position.
you
can
certainly
imagine
an
employee
reacting
in
a
particular
way
by
being
put
through
procedures
that
were
set
up
in
a
discriminatory
manner,
that
would
seem
to
anybody
to
be
a
basis
for
termination,
even
though
the
groundwork
was
laid
by
the
discriminatory
procedure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
you
--
how
is
that
consistent
with
the
statutory
language
that
requires
that
this
discrimination
simply
be
a
motivating
factor?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry.
the
statute
says
is
a
motivating
--
one
of
those
four
things,
membership,
application,
et
cetera,
is
a
motivating
factor
in
the
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
understood
your
position
to
be
that
the
supervisor
has
to
have
such
dominant
control
that
it's
the
"cat's
paw".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
where
i'm
having
trouble
following
you
is
the
total
domination-motivating
factor.
it
seems
like
a
much
more
stringent
test
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
adopted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
davis.
mr.
schnapper,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
