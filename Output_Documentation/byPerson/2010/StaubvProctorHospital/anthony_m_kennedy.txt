justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
a
sweeping
rule.
i
was
going
to
ask
a
related
hypothetical.
suppose
the
--
the
officer
who
is
in
charge,
charged
with
the
decision
to
terminate
or
not
to
terminate
says:
i'm
going
to
have
a
hearing.
you
can
both
have
counsel.
and
you
have
who,
is
it
--
suppose
buck
--
suppose
the
two
employees
that
were
allegedly
anti-military
here
testified
and
they
said
there
was
no
anti-military
bias,
and
the
person
is
then
terminated.
later
the
employee
has
evidence
that
those
two
were
lying.
could
he
bring
an
action
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
sweeping.
that's
almost
an
insurer's
liability
insofar
as
the
director
of
employment
is
concerned.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
has
to
insure.
he
has
--
he
has
done
everything
he
can,
he
has
an
hearing,
and
he
has
almost
absolute
liability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
this
just
governed
by
the
standard
principles
of
tort
for
concurrent
actors?
actor
a
was
not
negligent;
actor
b
was;
they
both
contributed
to
the
accident.
and
we
look
to
the
restatement
of
torts,
which
is
whether
or
not
the
wrongful
actor
made
a
significant
contribution.
that's
--
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
are
--
but
we
are
talking
about
the
test.
the
test
i
gave
you
is
quite
different
from
the
"cat's
paw"
test.
and
if
you
use
the
test
something
along
the
lines
that
i
formulated,
i
don't
know
if
that's
precisely
what
the
restatement
says--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
to
that
general
effect,
the
instruction
given
to
the
jury
was
really
overprotective
of
your
client,
under
the
standard
concurrent
--
concurrent
causation
analysis.
