ms.
lori
b.
palmer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
formality
is
indeed
essential
to
testimonial
utterance.
so
said
this
court
in
davis,
which
dealt
with
two
related
situations:
on-the-scene
questioning
by
police
officers
and
questions
by
9-1-1
operators.
this
court
noted
that
such
questioning
may
often
lack
the
formality
essential
to
testimonial
utterance,
as
officers
called
to
investigate
need
to
know
whom
they
are
dealing
with
in
order
to
assess
a
situation,
the
threat
to
themselves,
and
the
potential
danger
to
possible
victims.
the
question
here
is
whether
those
same
assessing
questions
--
"what
happened",
"who
did
it",
"where
did
it
happen"
--
asked
by
police
officers
who,
upon
receiving
a
radio
report
of
a
man
shot,
found
a
wounded
man
lying
on
the
ground
next
to
a
car
at
a
gas
station,
bleeding,
visibly
in
pain
and
having
trouble
talking
--
were
made
in
a
formal
context
sufficiently
similar
to
a
magisterial
examination
so
that
the
answers
by
the
dying
--
by
the
dying
victim
are
testimonial.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
which
is
where
the
ongoing
emergency
test
from
davis
comes
into
play.
the
questions
need
to
be
--
the
primary
purpose
needs
to
be
to
meet
an
ongoing
emergency.
so
assessing
the
risk,
assessing
the
danger
to
others.
and
any
questions
beyond
that
could
arguably
be
testimonial,
while--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--well,
under
davis,
you
said
--
that
was
how
you
tested
the
formality.
if
--
the
davis
test
is
a
gauge
of
formality.
if
there
are
questions
that
respond
to
ongoing
emergency,
then
this
court
has
said
that
that
is
an
indicator
that
it
lacks
the
formality.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
well,
i
think
that
what
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
--
i
mean,
obviously,
things
can
have
dual
purposes
and
often
will.
you
have
to
look
at
the
primary
purpose
here.
and
you
said
in
davis
it's
an
objective
--
what
would
an
objective
person
viewing
this
test--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--i
think
here,
in
this
line
in
davis,
you
said
the
primary
purpose
is
the
questioning
is
what
you
look
at
in
davis.
and
we
are
not
asking
you
to
overrule
that.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
what--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--but
the
formality
indicators
that
the
court
delineated
in
davis
did
not
include
whether
the
answers
to
the
questions
were
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
past
events,
but
whether
the
primary
purpose
of
the
questions
were
for
those
ends.
the
--
the
question
is
one
of
context,
not
content,
as
you
noticed
in
--
as
you
said
in
crawford.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
yes.
and
in
davis,
you
said
also
that
there
comes
a
point
where
courts
can
tell
when
the
questioning
takes
on
a
different
tone
and
the
answers
might
become
testimonial.
when
the
questioning
seeks
answers
that
go
beyond
meeting
the
emergency,
then
courts
can
properly
find
there's
a
point
where
the
non-testimonial
statements
end
and
the
testimonial
statements
begin.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
yes.
and
i
think
it
--
any
time
you
ask
the
court
to
delve
into
the
subjective
intent
of
someone
who
is
not
present
and
cannot
testify
and
cannot
tell
you,
it
necessarily
complicates
things.
and
i
think
it
takes
away--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--he
did
ask--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--the
police,
upon
responding
to
the
scene,
don't
know
that
this
emergency
is
limited--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--to
that
person.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
which
is
why
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
context.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
and
yet
that
subjective
mindset
doesn't
affect
the
formality.
it
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
this
is
an
informal
situation.
you
don't
have
the--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--he
would
have
to
be
unavailable
for
it
to
come
in.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
well,
under
--
as
the
way
the
current
jurisprudence
is,
he
would
have
to
be
unavailable.
if
it's
not
testimonial,
i
do
not
think
it
would
offend
the
confrontation
clause
for
it
to
come
in.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
change
the
nature
of
what
happened
at
the
time.
i
do
think,
though,
that
is
why
we
have
said
the
confrontation
clause
is
not
some
sort
of
super-hearsay
rule
and
we
will
allow
the
government--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--as
long
as
it
was
not
somehow
barred
by
the
rules
of
hearsay,
which
i
believe
it
would
be.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
that's
correct.
and
i
understand
there
is
the
footnote
stating
that,
obviously,
the
declarant's
statements
are
at
issue.
if
there
were
no
declarant,
then--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--there
wouldn't
be
an
issue.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
i
think
what
happens
is
the
interrogator's
statements
are
not
what
are
going
to
be
determined
to
be
testimonial
or
nontestimonial.
they
provide
a
glimpse
into
the
context.
so
we
can
determine
whether
those
statements
that
are
at
issue
are
testimonial
or
nontestimonial.
they
are
one
way
to
determine
the
formality
of
the
situation.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
correct.
but
as--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--right,
which
is
why
when
i
think
you
look
for
the
purpose
of
the
questioning
here,
it's
to
respond
to
an
ongoing
emergency.
the
police
don't
know--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--i
don't--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--i
don't
think
that
you
can
make
that
kind
of
bright-line
rule.
i
think
here
when
you
have
a
man
bleeding
out
on
a
sidewalk
and
you
don't
know
--
is
there
an
assailant
behind
him;
is
there
--
are
there
victims
somewhere
else;
is,
you
know,
this
a
wanted
felon
--
i
think
there
is
an
ongoing
emergency
until
you
can
determine--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--right.
but--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--well,
to
be
fair,
this
was
before
crawford
was
answered.
the
questions
were
asked
were
to
determine
whether
this
was
an
excited
utterance,
and
the
questions
that
we
would
like
to
know
now
were:
what
did
you
do
for
your
safety?
how
were
you
worried?
what
were
--
that
was
not
at
issue--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--correct.
and
i
was
simply
saying
the
record
would
have
been
better--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--yes.
so
our
position
here
is
that
you
cannot
evaluate
an
ongoing
emergency
from
hindsight.
when
police
--
you
know,
arrive
on
a
scene
and
find
a
wounded
man
bleeding,
they
don't
know
the
circumstances
until
they
can
find
out
what
happened,
who
did
it
and
where
did
it
happen,
and
try
to
assess
the
risk
of
harm,
as
you
said
in
davis,
to
themselves,
to
the
victim,
and
to
others.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
no.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
which
is
what
this
court
said
in
davis,
and
said
that
that
was
not
related
to
reliability
but
to
formality
there,
and
that
that
was
not
a
formal
thing,
such
as
a
magisterial
examination.
we
are
not
trying
to
question
or
in
any
way
change
the
test
already
set
forth
by
this
court
in
davis.
we
agree
with
that
test.
we
simply
disagree
with
the
application
by
the
lower
court
of
that
test
here
and
the
limitation
it
put
on
it.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
we
are
not
saying
that
any
time
there
is
a
perpetrator
at
large,
there
is
automatically
an
ongoing
emergency
until
that
person
is
caught.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
preliminary
inquiries
on
the
scene
to
try
to
determine
who
the
perpetrator
is
and
where
it
might
be
would
be--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--i
think,
obviously,
violent
crimes
raise
ongoing
emergencies,
emergencies
to
which
--
more
than
others.
there
could
also
be
contexts
in
which
it
would
apply
to
other
crimes.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
it
is
preliminary
questions
designed
to
assess
the
risk
to
themselves,
the
public,
and--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--i
think
if
the
context
shows
that's
the
primary
purpose,
then
yes,
that
will
often
be
the
case.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
well,
here,
for
instance,
it
was
admitted
as
an
excited
utterance.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
that's
correct.
and
i--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--your
--
i--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--yes.
and
i
did
misspeak.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
it
would
be
non-testimonial,
not
that
it
would
always
be
admissible.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
absolutely.
i
will
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
i
would
just
like
to
reiterate
that
the
underlying
principle
as
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
in
crawford
and
in
davis
is
formality,
and
that's
what
the
purpose
of
any
inquiry
should
be
in
looking
at
the
scene
whether
there
is
an
emergency
or
not
or
declarant's
view
or
not,
it
all
comes
down
to
formality
akin
to
a
magisterial
examination.
and
i
would
also.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
right.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
well--
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
--even
if,
even
if
you
take
that
view
that
it's
the
declarant's
purpose
or
objective
view
that
controls,
i
think
here
it's
difficult
to
see
how
covington's
purpose
could
have
been
to
provide
evidence
any
more
than
the
9-1-1
call
in
davis.
i
think
he
was
in
shock
from
a
bleeding
wound.
he
didn't
call
the
police.
they
came
to
him.
you
know,
this
wasn't
even
a
9-1-1
call
where
he
sought
them.
it's
not
clear
who
called,
but
it
was
not
him.
so
even
taking
it
from
his
point
of
view,
it
is
difficult
to
see
here
how
the
purpose
would
have
been
anything
other
than,
as
he
said,
when
is
ems
coming
to
help
me.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
i
don't
agree
with
that.
ms.
lori
b.
palmer
i
think
here
he
is
intending
to
seek
help
because
he
has
been
mortally
wounded.
thank
you.
