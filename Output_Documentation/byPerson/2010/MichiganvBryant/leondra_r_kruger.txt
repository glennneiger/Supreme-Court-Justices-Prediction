ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
we
understand
the
rule
of
davis
v.
washington,
it
is
a
rule
that
focuses
on
the
primary
purpose
behind
police
interrogation,
because
it's
designed
for
a
particular
purpose:
not
to
provide
a
comprehensive
definition
of
the
term
"testimonial",
but
rather
to
identify
those
statements
that
are
testimonial
because
they
are
made
in
response
to
police
interrogation.
when
the
objective
primary
purpose
of
that
interrogation
is
to
enable
police
to
meet
an
ongoing
emergency
rather
than
to
collect
evidence
for
future
possible
prosecution,
the
statements
that
are
given
in
response
to
that
interrogation
are
non-testimonial.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that
there
are
often
multiple
reasons,
particularly
in
the
wake
of
a
violent
event
like
a
shooting,
why--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
that
what
would
qualify
under
the
davis
test
is
if
police
need
to
apprehend
the
person,
not
for
purposes
of
bringing
the
person
into
the
criminal
justice
system,
but
rather
to
neutralize
an
ongoing
threat
that
they
present
to
the
community
at
large,
as
is
often
the
case
when
somebody
has
just
proven
themselves
both
capable
and--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
it
makes
a
significant
difference--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--justice
scalia,
i
think
it
makes
a
significant
difference
whether
we
are
talking
about
a
--
an
act
of
violence
like
a
shooting,
somebody
who
has
used
a
weapon
that
is
capable
of
inflicting
deadly
harm
on
multiple
victims
in
a
short
period
of
time,
or
someone
who
has
used
their
fists,
like
the
alleged
perpetrators--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
don't
think
that
we
would
draw
the
rules
that
broadly,
justice
scalia.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
think
that
in
this
situation,
we
have
police
arriving
on
the
scene
to
discover
a
man
who
has
been
recently
shot;
as
it
turns,
fatally.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
they
need
to
find
out
in
that
situation--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--they
need
to
find
out
who
did
it
so
that
they
make
sure
that
person
isn't
continuing
to
threaten
other
people
on
the
scene.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
think--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
don't
think
that
that's
the
case
at
all,
justice
scalia.
i
think
it's
actually
very
much
consistent
with
what
this
court
said
in
davis.
it
may
very
well
have
been
that
the
subjective
purpose
of
the
9-1-1
operator
was
also
to
bring
the
perpetrator
in
that
case
to
justice.
but
this
court,
i
think
quite
properly,
recognized
that
in
an
emergency
situation,
the
attention
of
both
law
enforcement
and
the
declarant
is
quite
properly
going
to
be
focused
on
dealing
with
the
emergency
at
hand
and
is
not
going
to
be
made
of
the
kind
of
focused
understanding
of--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--it
is
true
that
that
is
a
factual
distinction
between
this
case
and
davis,
but
we
don't
think
that
it's
one
that
makes
a
dispositive--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--no,
they
certainly
did
not
know
that,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that's
correct.
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
that.
and
neither,
for
that
matter
--
i
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
--
did
the
declarant.
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
escape
the
scene
and
managed
to
drive
himself
6
blocks
away
in
no
way
indicates
that
he
had
any--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
what
we
are
arguing
for
is
not
a
rule
that
would
say
as
long
as
there
is
a
violent
perpetrator
at
large,
as
long
as
he
is
at
large,
any
questions
that
police
ask
of
--
of
potential
people
who
have
information
about
the
crime
would
necessarily
be
non-testimonial.
our
argument
is
a
far
narrower
one,
and
one
that
we
think
follows
very
closely
from
the
principle
articulated
in
davis,
which
is
when
the
primary
purpose
of
the
police
interrogation
is
to
obtain
information
that
is
necessary
for
them
to
meet
an
ongoing
emergency--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
it's
actually
not
the
case,
justice
ginsburg,
that
they
would
have
asked
the
very
same
questions.
we
know
from
reading
the
trial
testimony
that
the
officers,
as
they
appeared
on
the
scene
in
response
to
the
police
run
of
a
man
being
shot,
asked
the
same
question
over
and
over
again.
each
officer,
as
they
approached
him,
said:
what
happened?
where
did
it
happen?
and
wanted
to
know
how
to
recognize
the
shooter
so
when
they
proceeded
to
the
scene
they
would
know
who
they
were
dealing
with
and
how
to
safeguard
themselves.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
they
weren't
asking
the
type
of
questions--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--we
think
that
the
principle
that
this
court
announced
in
davis
and
we
are
asking
this
court
to
apply
again
today
reflects
two
principles
that
underlie
the
confrontation
clause
as
this
court
interpreted
it
in
crawford.
the
first
is
that
testimony
is
typically
characterized
by
the
kind
of
focused
understanding
by
the
declarant
that
the
person
is
providing
information
for
potential
use
in
future
prosecution.
it's
--
the
petitioner
in
davis,
i
would
note,
made
an
argument
to
this
court
that
whenever
a
person
calls
9-1-1,
they
do
so
with
an
awareness
that
the
information
they
provide
may
be
used
for
prosecutorial
purposes.
but
this
court
rejected
that
argument,
because
it
understood,
i
think
quite
rightly,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
providing
that
sort
of
information
to
law
enforcement
with
a
sort
of
vague
awareness
that
that
might
be
its
potential
use,
and
doing
so
with
the
kind
of
focused
understanding
that
has
been
characteristic
of
the
testimonial
statements
this
court
has
so
far
identified,
like
sylvia
crawford's
station
house
interview
in
crawford
or
amy
hammon's
interview
with
the
police
officer
from
the
safety
of
her
kitchen
that
resulted
in
the
execution
of
a
formal
affidavit
in
the
davis
case.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
to
take
your
first
question
first,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
that
the
trial
testimony
is
not
quite
as
clear
on
the
question
of
what
fears
the
officers
had
as
i
think
respondent
has
suggested
in
his
brief.
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix
page
136,
officer
stuglin
testified
that
he
was,
in
fact,
afraid
for
his
safety
when
he
got
to
the
gas
station.
i
would
note
that
all
of
the
officers
when
they
left
the
gas
station
after
ems
arrived
they
proceeded
immediately
to
the
location
of
the
shooting.
the
location
that
anthony
covington
had
identified
for
them.
when
they
got
there,
they
took
a
tactical
position
and
they
waited
for
back-up
and
they
did
so
because
they
were
afraid
that
a
shooter
was
in
the
house,
and
they
wanted
to
proceed
very
cautiously
in
making
sure
that
they
neutralized
the
threat
that
shooter
posed
to
the
public
safety,
including
their
own.
i
think
that
in
examining
the
exigencies
of
a
situation
a
court
would
be
justified
in
looking
at
the
circumstances
in
which
the
crime
occurred,
and
could
very
well
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
crime
occurred
at
3:00
in
the
morning
as
opposed
to
5:00
in
the
afternoon.
but
i
think
that
we
would
expect
any
reasonable
police
officer
to
do
precisely
what
the
police
officers
in
this
case
did,
which
is
proceed
directly
to
the
scene,
not
use
their
interview
with
anthony
covington
as
an
occasion
to
execute
an
affidavit
or
otherwise--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
that
the
test
that
the
court
set
out
in
davis
is
one
that
focuses
on
the
purpose
of
the
interrogation
because
of
the
limited
context
in
which
that--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--in
the
end
it's
the
declarant's
statement
that
the
confrontation
clause
requires
us
to
examine.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
we
read
footnote
1
to
be
an
acknowledgement
that
answers
given
in
response
to
police
interrogation
do
not
constitute
the
universe
of
possible
testimonial
statements,
that
testimony
can
indeed
be
volunteered
as
was
lord
cobham's
letter,
for
example,
in
sir
walter
raleigh's
treason
case,
but
in
the
end
davis,
i
think,
quite
properly
focuses
on
the
primary
purpose
of
the
interrogation.
