justice
antonin
scalia
forget
about
formality,
in
other
words.
formality
or
no
formality
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
--
that
is
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
--
it's
the
--
it's
the
purpose
of
the
declarant,
not
of
the
questioner.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
possible
response
to
an
ongoing
emergency
could
he
have
had
in
mind?
what
possible
response
to
an
ongoing
emergency?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
bleeding
to
death
and
he
could
have
said,
you
know,
i'm
bleeding
to
death.
now,
that
statement
would
--
would
be,
you
know,
suggesting
an
ongoing
emergency.
but
giving
the
name
of
the
person
who
shot
him,
where
he
was
shot,
what
does
that
have
anything
--
how
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
an
ongoing
emergency?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
knows
--
he
knows
that
his
--
that
the
person
that
shot
him
is
nowhere
near
there.
he
knows
that
--
that
he
drove,
what
--
how
far
away
was
it?
six
blocks
or
--
a
good
distance
from
where
the
shooter
was.
he
knows
all
of
that.
the
only
reason
he
could
be
giving
the
name
of
the
person
who
shot
him
is
so
that
person
could
be
apprehended
and
punished.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
way
to
evaluate
those
statements
is
what
they
are
made
in
response
to.
if
they
are
made
in
response
to
a
certain
type
of
police
inquiry,
they
are
more
likely
to
be
testimonial.
and
another
kind
--
you
know,
are
you
dying?
they
are
more
likely
not
to
be
testimonial.
but
it
is
ultimately
the
statements
that
--
that
we
have
to
evaluate,
whether
they
are
testimonial
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it
was
an
emergency,
he
wouldn't
have
asked,
"what
happened"?
he
would
ask,
"what
is
happening"?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
ask
what
happened
is
to
ask
the
declarant
to
describe
past
events,
which
is
testimonial.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
were
worried
about
that,
do
you
run
immediately
over
to
the
person
lying
on
the
ground
or
do
you
examine
the
gas
station
first,
rather
than
expose
yourself
to
the
--
to
the
shooter
that
you
think
is
still
in
the
gas
station?
the
--
the
behavior
of
the
police
here
gave
no
indication
that
they
thought
they
were
in
danger
immediately,
and
--
and
were
interrogating
this
person
in
order
to
assess
the
danger
to
them.
that
wasn't
what
they
were
after.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
at
least
whenever
the
police
come
upon
somebody
who
has
been
the
victim
of
a
violent
crime,
whatever
interrogation
they
conduct
could
plausibly
be
to
--
to
make
sure
that
the
person
is
not
still
nearby,
and
that
testimony
will
always
be
admissible?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no.
it's
not
designed
to
assess
the
risk.
you
don't
know
what
they
are
designed
to
do.
these
policemen
didn't
say:
we
are
assessing
the
risk.
they
just
asked
the
questions.
and
that's
what
is
going
to
happen
in
future
cases.
and
you
are
saying,
whenever
policemen
come
upon
a
victim
of
violent
crime
and
said:
who
did
it?
what's
his
name?
all
of
that
will
always
be
admissible,
because
they
--
they
could
be
assessing
the
risk,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
when
he's
excited,
right?
only
when
the
victim
who
has
been
the
object
of
a
violent
crime
is
excited.
or
if
state
law
doesn't
apply
and
we
are
dealing
with
a
federal
crime
and
federal
officers,
right,
and
trial
in
federal
court?
and
in
that
case,
what
justice
breyer
just
said
would
not
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
distinguish
between
collecting
evidence
for
a
future
prosecution
and
collecting
evidence
in
order
to
pursue
and
arrest
the
felon?
do
you
distinguish
those
two?
and
you
can
say
these
police
--
these
policemen
weren't
collecting
evidence
for
a
future
prosecution;
they
just
wanted
to
know
who
the
shooter
was
and
where
he
was
so
they
could
go
get
him.
would
that
--
would
that
not
be
collecting
evidence
for
a
future
prosecution?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
it
has
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
a
future
prosecution.
just
--
just
in
order
to
an
arrest
and
bring
into
jail
the
person
who
committed
this
crime,
that
doesn't
qualify?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
does
that
not
exist
in
the
case
of
a
violent
crime?
when
does
that
not
exist?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a
violent
criminal
out
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
if
you
use
a
gun,
a
knife,
or
a
machinegun,
whatever
the
victim
says
gets
admitted
into
evidence,
because
the
police
could
--
could
be
not
--
not
trying
to
get
evidence,
but
just
trying
to
safeguard
society
against
the
--
the
felon
on
the
loose?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
how
you
just
described
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
did
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
always
the
case.
that's
such
a
phony
evasion
of
what
the
purpose
of
a
testimonial
rule
is.
that's
always
going
to
be
the
case,
at
least
when
there
is
a
violent
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
may
as
well
take
crawford
and
throw
it
out,
in
--
in
the
majority
of
serious
cases,
if
that's
going
to
be
your
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
crime
was
ongoing
in
--
in
davis
when
--
when
the
woman
was
on
the
phone
with
the
operator.
it
was
ongoing.
she
was
seeking
help
from
the
emergency
that
was
occurring
to
her
at
that
moment.
there
is
nothing
like
that
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
will
they
ever
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
is
that
--
is
that
likely
not
always
to
be
the
case
when
--
when
you
come
upon
a
person
who
has
been
the
--
they
victim
of
a
violent
crime?
you
can
say
it
all
the
time.
no,
they
didn't
know
where
the
--
where
the
offender
was,
so
whatever
this
person
says
comes
in
as
evidence
in
a
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
answer,
counsel,
is
that
we
decided
that
in
crawford
from
which
justice
breyer
dissented.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
we
said
in
crawford,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
van
hoek,
what
is
the
basis
for
your
concession
that
a
dying
declaration
is
an
exception
from
the
confrontation
clause?
it
is
an
exception
from
hearsay,
for
certain,
but
from
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
conceded
it.
it's
been
the
whole
basis
for
justice
ginsburg's
subsequent
interrogation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
thought
it
was
an
open
question
only
--
only
where
the
--
the
defendant
has
effected
the
death
of
the
person
who
has
made
the
dying
declaration.
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
that
allow
a
dying
declaration
in
over
a
confrontation
clause
objection.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
hasn't
been
reached
and
if
it
is
not
an
established
exception
to
the
confrontation
clause,
there
is
no
basis
for
saying,
therefore,
the
confrontation
clause
pertains
only
to
reliability.
it
pertains
to
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
and
--
and
reliability
exceptions
are
what
we
used
to
do
under
--
under
reynolds.
if
it
was
reliable,
we
let
it
in.
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
reliable
as
a
dying
declaration
instead
of
reliable
as
to
something
else
ought
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
confrontation
clause
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
guy
in
the
gas
station
is
present.
it's
not
past.
he
is
making
an
assertion
the
guy
who
is
now
in
the
gas
station
shot
me.
the
shot
me
is
past,
but
he
is
asserting
that
the
person
is
now
in
the
gas
station.
that
is
a
statement
of
a
present
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
you
mean,
by
in
the
past,
as
justice
breyer
put
it.
undoubtedly
under
the
regime
of
united
states
v.
reynolds
which
was
what,
25
years
old
--
when--
justice
antonin
scalia
--roberts,
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
roberts.
reynolds
was
the
mormon
case
--
which
was
about
25
years
old
or
so
when
crawford
was
decided,
yes,
hearsay
was
your
protection,
and
that
was
it.
but
if
by
--
what
you
had
mean
is
in
the
past,
crawford
examined
the
past
and
its
conclusion
as
to
what
the
past
said
is
quite
different
from
what
justice
breyer
now
says,
although
he
joined
crawford.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
can
always
do
it.
you
--
you
don't
say
they
can't
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can
always
ask
the
questions.
the
only
issue
here
is
not
whether
they
can
ask
the
questions,
but
whether
after
they
ask
them
the
answers
can
be
introduced
at
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
they
ask
his
name?
god,
it's
really
important
for
us
to
know,
four
students
on
the
ground.
what's
the
name
of
the
guy
that
did
this?
that's
not
the
emergency.
they
would
say
where
is
he.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
are
saying.
you
mean
he
has
to
intend
to
provide
evidence
that
he
knows
will
be
used
at
trial?
i
don't
think
that's
the
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
intending
to
accuse
somebody.
