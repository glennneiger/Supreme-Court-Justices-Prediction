justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
--
you
do
not
know
if
the
man
is
running
amok
and
threatening
to
shoot
other
people
or
if
--
if
he
is
drunk,
if
he
is
on
a
rampage,
if
it's
a
college
campus,
then
it's
--
it's
--
it's
a
sniper.
you
just
don't
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
policemen
should
read
crawford
before
they
perform
their
--
their
peacekeeping
duties.
the
--
no
--
no
one
questions
the
right
of
the
police
to
--
to
ask
these
questions
and
to
use
the
word
either
"happens"
or
"happening"
or
"happened".
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
answers
are,
later,
admissible.
those
are
two
different
inquiries.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and,
of
course,
crawford
rejects
reliability
as
a
criteria.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
police
know
that
that
was
the
case
when
they
began
the
questioning?
did
the
police
know
that
this
man
was
not
on
a
rampage,
that
he
was
not
going
to
act
in
self-defense
when
they
came
after
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
he
was
not
taking
hostages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
say--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let's
say
that
we
--
let's
say
that
we
agree
with
you
that
there
was
an
emergency
and
the
police
were
asking
questions
in
order
to
mitigate
the
emergency.
what
would
be
the
rationale
for
admitting
this
statement,
then?
is
it
more
reliable?
because
if
we
say
that,
then
we
are
undercutting
crawford,
which
says
reliability
is
not
the
key.
what
is
the
reason
for
this?
is
it
because
the
police
likely
have
less
motive
to
manipulate
the
--
the
statements
and
to
ask
loaded
questions?
that
in
itself,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
reliable
--
but
what
is
the
--
assuming
we
adopt
your
distinction,
what
is
the
rationale
for
the
distinction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
hear
the
end.
in
locating
and?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
perhaps
there
is
another
answer
that
i
would
like
to
hear.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
rationale
for
dying
declaration
admissions
was
that
they
are
inherent
reliable
--
inherently
reliable.
you
can
certainly
question
that.
but
i
thought
that
that
was
the
rationale
that
the
court
gave.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
your
death
bed
before
you
are
going
to
meet
the
maker,
you
were
not
going
to
lie,
i
think
that
was
the
test.
so
it
was
a
reliability
component,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
suppose
that
there
is
a
universe
of
instances
that
says
we
can
identify
as
questions
in
order
to
alleviate
and
stop
an
emergency
to
prevent
a
crime
from
becoming
aggravated
and
continuous.
let's
suppose
we
can
have
a
universe
of
those
questions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
--
is
there
an
argument
that
responses
made
for
that
purpose
are
more
reliable?
is
that
what
--
is
that
what
underlies
the
so-called
emergency
exception,
do
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
--
so
the
--
well
--
and,
of
course,
davis
is
certainly
does
not
rest
on
reliability
--
crawford
rather
doesn't
rest
on
reliability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
that
really
the
only
way
to
explain
the
911
exception?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
there
a
reliability
component
that
underlies
this
whether
we
like
it
or
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
--
isn't
the
reason
we
accept
that
is
because
it's
reliable.
it's
an
excited
utterance,
it's
an
account
of
an
ongoing
event.
it's
a
contemporaneous
observation,
therefore,
it
is
reliable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
--
you
--
you
were
you
the
one
that
drew
the
line
between
a
past
event
and
ongoing
event.
suppose
the
sniper
says,
i've
shot
you
now,
and
i'm
going
to
shoot
three
other
students,
good-bye.
that's
a
past
event.
