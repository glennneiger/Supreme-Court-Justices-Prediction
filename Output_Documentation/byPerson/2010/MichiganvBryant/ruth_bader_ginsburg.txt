how
do
we--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
do
we
tell
that?
because
it
seems
to
me,
here,
if
you
want
to
know
what
happened,
you
would
ask
the
very
same
questions.
you
are
saying
the
questions
are
relevant
also
to
securing
the
situation.
but
what
--
what
--
what
different
questions
would
you
ask
if
you
wanted
to
find
out
what
happened?
what
was
the
past
--
what
were
the
past
events?
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
understand
how
you
take
these
questions
and
say
we
can
put
a
label
on
them
here
that
says,
well,
this
is
to
control
an
emergency
situation,
versus
we
want
to
know
what
happened
historically.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
he
had
survived.
suppose
covington
had
survived
instead
of
died.
and
then
the
prosecutor
says,
i
want
to
introduce
this
evidence
against
bryant.
would
you
say
that,
yes,
it's
nontestimonial,
so
it
comes
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why,
if
it's
nontestimonial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
said
--
you
said
it's
--
you
are
typing
it
nontestimonial.
it
goes
to
emergency
situations.
so
i'm
saying:
would
that
carry
over
to
the
man
survived
and
the
prosecutor
says,
i
don't
need
to
put
him
on
the
stand
so
he
can
be
cross-examined;
i
have
got
nontestimonial
evidence
that
i
can
put
in?
would
it
become
testimonial,
then,
if
he
survived?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
--
then
your
answer
is
that
if
we
typed
it
as
nontestimonial
in
my
trial
scenario,
it
would
be
nontestimonial,
it
comes
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
are
you
saying
that
the
rule
would
be
that
whenever
the
perpetrator
may
be
in
the
vicinity,
then
the
police
are
pursuing
an
urgent
emergency
situation
rather
than
trying
to
find
out
what
had
--
the
nature
of
the
crime?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
--
if
you
had
the
benefit
of
hindsight
and
this
trial
occurred
before
davis,
and
so
the
prosecutor
went
on
excited
utterance,
would
you
have
instead
tried
to
make
a
case
that
this
was
a
dying
declaration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
how
do
you
know
that?
because
they
would
ask
the
same
very
questions
if
what
they
wanted
was
testimonial
evidence.
so
you
can
--
you
can
characterize
that
set
of
questions
either
way.
what
would
lead
us
to
pick
one
rather
than
the
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
officers
zeroed
in
on
the
victim.
no
one
was
looking
around
to
see
if
anybody
was
lurking
in
the
bushes.
then
as
far
as
protecting
the
public,
do
we
take
into
account
that
this
was
between
3:30
and
4:00
in
the
morning
when
they
are
not
likely
to
be
many
members
of
the
public
around,
or
do
we
just
say,
you
find
someone,
looks
like
he
has
been
the
victim
of
a
violent
crime,
doesn't
matter
whether
the
public
is
around
or
not,
we
--
the
victim
of
a
violent
crime
can
be
asked
these
questions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
go
back
to
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
excited
utterance
was
--
the
prosecutor
thought
that
was
his
best
shot,
and
he
--
and
he
prevailed,
except
that
the
--
davis
intervened.
i
asked
ms.
palmer,
suppose
we
were
back
there
at
the
trial
and
the
prosecutor
knew
that
excited
utterance
wouldn't
work,
could
he
have
raised
dying
declaration?
she
said
absolutely
yes.
so
my
question
to
you
is,
just
assume
that
we
should
hold
the
confrontation
clause
that
is
applicable.
shouldn't
the
prosecutor
then
have
a
chance
to
say,
well,
if
i
realized
that,
i
could
have
made
a
dying
declaration
plea
here,
so
it
would
only
be
fair
to
allow
the
prosecutor
to
try
to
establish
that
this
testimony
was
a
dying
declaration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
she
argue
dying
declaration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
--
that
--
that
was
in
the
pre-davis
world.
but
do
you
think
the
prosecutor
had
abandoned
that
effort
had
he
been
informed
about
davis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question
was
based
on
its
an
open
question,
because
we
have
said
maybe
dying
declaration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
wasn't
--
and
it
wasn't
in
giles.
it
wasn't
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--whether
you
agree
or
not,
we
said
it
was
an
open
question.
