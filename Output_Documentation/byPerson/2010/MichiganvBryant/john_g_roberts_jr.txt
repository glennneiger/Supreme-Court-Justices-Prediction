chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-150,
michigan
v.
bryant.
ms.
palmer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
can't
all
be
the
formality
of
the
context.
i
mean,
if
the
police
came
in
and
said,
well,
has
this
person
--
rick,
i
guess
--
sold
you
drugs
before,
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
quantity,
and
all
those
sorts
of
questions,
the
answers
to
that
would
be
testimonial,
despite
the
same
lack
of
formality.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
confused
on
what
--
what
davis
focuses
our
inquiry
on.
is
it
the
purpose
of
the
interrogators
or
is
it
the
purpose
of
the
declarants?
we
say
the
statements
are
testimonial
when
the
circumstances
objectively
indicate
that
there
is
no
such
ongoing
emergency,
and
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
interrogation
is
to
establish
or
prove
past
events.
the
--
the
focus
seems
to
be
on
the
purpose
of
the
interrogation,
which
seems
to
be
the
question
of
what
the
police
thought,
not
what
the
--
the
person
dying
thought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
mean--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
what
the
footnote
--
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
but
what
the
footnote
says
is
in
the
final
analysis,
it's
the
declarant's
statements,
not
the
interrogator's
question,
that
the
confrontation
clause
requires
us
to
evaluate.
so
which
--
i
guess,
which
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then,
how
does
that
apply?
the
officer
says,
what
happened?
and
the
--
the
declarant
says,
rick
shot
me.
now,
is
that
testimonial
or
not?
because
the
declarant
knows
he
is
6
miles
away.
it's
not
going
to
help
them
solve
an
emergency,
but
the
police
don't
know
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
you
are
saying
that
the
focus
is
on
the
police
officers.
and
after
all,
we
are
not
saying
that
police
officers
can't
do
this,
we
are
just
saying
the
testimonial
aspects
can't
be
admitted
into
evidence
or
that
is
what
your
friend
is
arguing
for.
i
still
have
trouble
figuring
out
is
the
issue
the
purpose
of
the
interrogating
officers,
or
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
declarant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
and
what
do
you
do
with
the
last
sentence
on
footnote
1.
it's
the
one
that
says--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--right,
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
van
hoek.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
is
a
good
time
to
try
to
jump
in,
i
think.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
do
you
do
--
what
do
you
do
with
the
statement
"the
guy
in
the
gas
station
shot
me?
"
is
that
purely
past
or
is
that
an
ongoing
emergency?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
the
guy
in
the
gas
station
is
still
there
with
a
gun,
the
police
are
within
range?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
i
mean,
that
strikes
me
as
something
that
happened
in
the
past,
he
shot
me,
but
at
the
same
time
demonstrates
an
ongoing
emergency
because
he
is
right
there
and
he
might
shoot
you.
i'm
suggesting
the
line
you
propose
to
justice
alito
doesn't
work.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
sure
it
can.
if
he
says
the
principal
did
it.
it's
10:00
in
the
morning,
you
assume
the
principal
is
at
the
school
and
he
says
the
principal
did
it.
you
can
infer
from
the
circumstances
that
he
is
referring
to
an
ongoing
emergency.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
quite
different
from
saying
this
happened
to
some
guy
driving
by
or
something
like
that.
if
it
says
the
principal
did
it,
it's
at
10:00,
it's
in
the
school,
that
suggests
to
me
more,
not
that
the
dying
student
or
the
wounded
student
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
principal
was
convicted,
but
there
is
an
emergency,
something
is
happening.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
no.
you
don't
want
them
to
have
to
go
through,
you
know,
a
whole
list
of
questions
while
the
students
there
dying
and
the
principal
is
inside
the
building
shooting
people?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
palmer,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
