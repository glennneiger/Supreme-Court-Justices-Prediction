justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
mean?
how
could
it
possibly
be
admissible.
first,
there
has
to
be
a
degree
of
formality,
as
the
court
held
in
hammon,
sitting
in
the
kitchen;
and
second,
it
has
to
satisfy
state
hearsay
tests.
so
unless
it's
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule,
it
is
not
admissible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
of
course
there
are
exceptions.
there
could,
in
fact,
there
could
be
a
coconspirator
exception.
there
could
be
a
dying
declaration
exception,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
the
constitution
keeps
it
out,
even
though
state
law
--
because,
say
it's
a
coconspirator
exception
--
would
permit
it
in.
so
the
answer
is
no,
it's
not
the
case
that
whenever
you
come
across
a
victim
of
a
crime
and
ask
him
questions,
it's
going
to
be
admissible.
it
depends.
the
state
hears
the
law,
the
exception,
and
whether
there
is
a
degree
of
formality,
as
there
would
in
hammon.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
not
apply?
there
are
--
there
isn't
a
federal
hearsay
rule?
and
there
are
not
exceptions
that
you
have
to
satisfy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
there
were,
in
my
copy
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
--
what
keeps
that
out?
i
mean,
assuming
that
a
state
law
or
federal
rules
of
evidence
admitted
as
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule,
why
should
the
confrontation
clause
bar
it?
there
is
not
great
likelihood
that
like
sir
walter
raleigh
or
cobham's
affidavit
is
going
to
be
introduced,
per
se,
into
the
trial
as
a
form
of
evidence
that
there
was
--
why
would
we
want
to
keep
it
out?
that
is
the
part
that
i
do
not
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
think
he
did
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
like
to
hear
your
answer
because
i
don't
think
we
decided
it
in
crawford.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
mean,
does
it
mean
that
the
individual
is
thinking
this
may
be
used
--
there
is
a
certain
formality
of
the
situation,
it
may
be
used
at
trial
or
it
may
just
happen
to
turn
out?
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
formality
of
the
situation?
when
i
looked
into
history
i
thought
--
i'm
not
an
expert
in
history
--
and
i'm
also
understand
that
have
been
situations
where
the
court's
gone
back
to
prior
cases
and
looked
at
footnotes
and
said
it
doesn't
express
things
precisely
clearly
and
changed
it
a
little
bit.
i
think
that
that
all
could
be
open
to
us.
so
i
want
to
know
what
the
basic
reason
is
that
would
justify
keeping
out,
let's
say
an
investigation.
there
is
an
investigation
of
a
crime,
and
a
policeman
comes
across
a
confederate
who
makes
some
statements
just
generally
that
help
the
investigation,
therefore
it
would
come
in
as
co-conspiracy,
okay?
what
in
the
constitution,
what
functional
principle
is
there
that
says
we
should
keep
that
out
of
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
all
hearsay?
now
all
hearsay
evidence,
despite
state
or
federal
rule
makers
saying
there
are
exceptions
where
the
trustworthiness
is
sufficient,
such
as
co-confederates
--
confederates,
all
of
that
is
wiped
out
by
crawford?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
what
i'm
looking
for
now
is
whether
there
is
any
sense
to
that?
what
is
the
constitutional
rationale?
i
agree
on
joining
crawford,
but
i
have
to
admit
to
you
i
have
had
many
second
thoughts
when
i've
seen
how
far
it
has
extended
as
i
have
written
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
value
of
just
what
i'm
looking
for.
what
i'm
looking
for
is
i
can
go
into
blackstone
a
little
bit
and
look
back
and
see
what
this
was
after,
was
the
problem
of
sir
walter
raleigh's
trial
and
the
marion
judges,
and
now
what
i
need
is
a
line.
because
if
i
can't
find
a
line,
then
what
we've
done
would
seem
just
as
wrong
to
me,
is
suddenly
bar
virtually
all
hearsay
exception
evidence
of
which
for
400
years,
or
200
years
anyway,
there
has
been
quite
a
lot
in
the
courts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what,
in
your
view,
is
the
correct
line
and
why,
most
importantly
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
--
i'll
try
to
--
i
think
you're
just
--
you
don't
like
my
--
where
i'm
coming
from,
and
so
you
might
not
have
an
answer
to
this.
but
--
but
in
my
mind,
i
see
a
line,
and
that
line
is
dividing
what
i
think
of
as
the
confrontation
clause,
sir
walter
raleigh
situation,
which
i
have
in
my
mind
as
people
going
into
a
room
and
saying,
"now
write
out
your
testimony",
and
they
write
it
out
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit,
or
they
send
in
a
letter,
and
they
say
"bye",
and
then
they
walk
next
door
to
the
trial
and
introduce
it.
i
mean,
that's
walter
raleigh,
in
my
mind.
and
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
is
an
evidentiary
rules
that
are
basically
in
state
cases
run
by
the
state.
and
they
sometimes
let
hearsay
in
and
they
sometimes
don't,
and
they
make
reliability
et
cetera
judgments
in
developing
their
--
their
decision
as
to
how
hearsay
exceptions
will
work.
okay?
now
why
don't
i
like
emergency
to
draw
that?
the
reason
i
don't
like
the
word
emergency
is
i
think
police
do
lots
of
things
other
than
handle
emergency
and
develop
testimony.
there
is
a
range
of
things
that
you
would
describe
as
investigating
the
circumstance.
there
is
no
danger.
there
have
been
a
string
of
robberies.
they
go
around
and
ask
the
grocery
store
people
and
everything
what
happened.
now
i
don't
know
why
we
should
keep
out
evidence
that
say,
is
given
in
that
situation
by
a
confederate.
it
turns
out
he
was
the
assistant
--
why?
and
if
i
don't
like
that,
i
don't
like
the
emergency
rule
as
doing
the
--
as
doing
the
work
there,
and
i'm
looking
for
something
else.
now
you
have
my
whole
train
of
thought.
if
you
want
to
say
judge,
there
is
nothing
but
the
emergency
rule,
you
are
perfectly
free
to
say
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
not.
they
are
just
asking
--
all
right.
yes.
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
just
--
but
in
the
past
that
situation
you
are
describing
arose
only
where
there
was
a
hearsay
exception.
i
would
imagine
most
likely
it
would
be
the
case
of
a
confederate,
someone
who
was
part
of
the
conspiracy.
so
if
i
think
if
that
is
going
to
be
the
case,
it
probably
will
be
admissible
where
this
has
bite.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
be
some
others,
excited
utterances
may
be
another.
dying
declarations
are
probably
few
and
far
between.
baptismal
certificates?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
they
did.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
i'm
finding
that
--
it
seems
to
me
that
line
if
taken
literally
would
keep
out
exceptions
to
hearsay
testimony,
which
have
been
well
established
in
the
united
states
for
200
years.
baptismal
certificates,
statements
of
birth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
confederates
is
the
one
i
come
back
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
okay.
i
forgot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
many
--
i
mean,
like
many
cases
there
is
language
that
can
take
us
far
afield
from
the
subject
matter
before
us.
and
i
will
admit
that
i
did
not
foresee
the
scope
of
crawford.
so
i'm
really
asking
about
that
scope,
and
in
particular,
whether
looking
to
the
past
or
to
reason,
or
to
whatever
you
want,
there
is
a
good
reason
for
keeping
out
the
testimony
of
say
a
coconfederate,
a
coconspirator
--
where
it
was
elicited,
not
with
intent
to
introduce
it
into
the
courtroom,
but
it
was
elicited
in
the
course
of
an
ordinary
investigation
of
a
crime.
