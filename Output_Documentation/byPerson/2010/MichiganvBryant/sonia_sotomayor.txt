justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
whose
primary
purpose
is
it?
i
mean,
the
victim
here
knew
that
the
incident
hadn't
happened
there.
there
was
nothing
he
had
to
share
with
the
police,
because
they
could
see
he
was
bleeding
from
his
stomach
and
he
had
been
shot.
he
apparently
didn't
fear
any
threat,
or
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
circumstances
suggesting
an
immediate
threat
to
him.
he
had
driven
away.
rick
didn't
know
where
he
had
gone.
so
what's
the
ongoing
emergency
to
the
victim?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
wait
a
minute.
what
is
the
primary
--
isn't
--
doesn't
--
isn't
there
a
footnote
that
says
the
primary
purpose
of
the
declarant
is
what
is
at
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
in
davis,
the
issue
is:
why
was
the
declarant
talking?
what
you
were
trying
to
do
was
to
figure
out
whether
the
declarant
was
seeking
help
or
attempting
to
get
someone
arrested.
that's
how
i
read
the
situation.
the
questions
provided
context
for
that.
are
you
seeking
immediate
ongoing
help
or
are
you
talking
about
an
event,
attempting
to
get
the
police
to
intercede
and
arrest
the
person?
isn't
that
a
fair
reading
of
that
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
--
we
are
back
to
the
reliability
test,
really,
because
they
didn't
do
anything
wrong.
they
were
trying
to
assess
the
situation.
but
that's
just
what
they
do
when
any
report
of
criminal
activity
occurs.
that's
a
different
inquiry
than
the
inquiry
of:
why
should
that
statement
be
permitted
to
be
introduced
at
trial?
it
goes
to
the
very
essence
of
reliability.
was
the
statement
made
under
circumstances
that
would
suggest
an
intent
to
testify?
that's
really
what
you're
getting
at,
isn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
are,
because
you
were
trying
to
pigeonhole
yourself
into
an
ongoing
emergency
that
suggests
that
in
those
situations,
whatever
the
person
is
saying
is
okay,
because
it
was
done
to
assess
an
emergency
situation
and
not
done
for
purposes
of
catching
somebody,
primary
purpose
of
catching
somebody.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
for
all
crimes,
or
only
for
shooting
crimes
or
knifing
crimes?
for
explosions?
what
kinds
of
crimes
would
qualify?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
think
there
is
a
danger
implicated
by
coming
onto
the
lawn
of
a
school
and
a
student
is
there
and
says
the
principal
shot
me
inside.
you
don't
think
that
that
suggests
an
ongoing
emergency?
that
the
principal
is
still
inside
with
a
gun?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
he
shoot
you
because
he
had
a
grudge
against
you
or
did
he
just
shoot
you
blindly
and
he
says
he
shot
me?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
go
to
formality.
it
can't
be
that
you
arrive
at
a
scene
of
a
crime
and
everything
a
victim
tells
you
is
admissible.
there
has
to
be
some
emergency.
that's
what
we
have
said.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
correct?
so
the
issue
here
is
how
do
you
define
that
dividing
line
between
emergency
and
non
when
the
police
officers
are
just
asking
questions
that
by
their
nature
are
always
going
to
be
testimonial,
because
they
are
going
to
use
or
try
to
use
whatever
is
said
later.
so
in
discerning
the
primary
purpose,
i
think
your
adversary
is
saying,
you
can't
go
by
what
the
police
officer
are
asking,
because
they
are
going
to
be
asking
dual
motive
always.
you
have
to
look
to
what
the
declarant
tells
you.
and
is
he
or
she
telling
you
something
that
suggests
an
emergency?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
really
the
difference
between
the
two
of
you,
i
think.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
police
officers
responded
to
a
call
that
a
man
had
been
shot.
they
found
anthony
--
anthony
covington
lying
in
a
gas
station
parking
lot,
bleeding
from
a
mortal
gunshot
wound
to
his
stomach.
the
police
officer
first
asked
him,
“what
happened?”
he
told
them
the
respondent
richard
bryant
had
shot
him
about
25
minutes
earlier
in
a
few
blocks
away.
covington
died
a
few
hours
later.
at
bryant's
trial,
the
police
officers
testified
about
what
covington
said
to
them.
bryant
was
convicted
but
on
appeal,
the
michigan
supreme
court
reversed
holding
that
covington's
statements
to
the
police
were
inadmissible
hearsay
under
our
decisions
in
crawford
versus
washington
and
davis
versus
washington.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
correct
that
covington
statements
were
testimonial.
we
now
reverse.
in
crawford,
we
held
that
the
confrontation
clause
in
the
sixth
amendment
to
our
constitution
requires
that
defendants
have
the
opportunity
to
confront
those
who
provide
testimonial
evidence
against
them.
in
davis,
we
explained
that
statements
made
in
the
course
of
police
interrogations
are
non-testimonial
when
they
have
a
primary
purpose
of
enabling
police
assistance
to
meet
an
ongoing
emergency.
they
are
testimonial
when
they
have
a
primary
purpose
to
establish
or
prove
past
events
potentially
relevant
to
later
criminal
prosecution.
to
determine
the
primary
purpose
of
an
interrogation,
we
objectively
evaluate
the
statements
and
actions
of
the
parties
to
the
encounter
in
light
of
the
circumstances
in
which
the
investigation
occurs.
the
existence
of
an
ongoing
emergency
or
the
parties'
perception
that
an
emergency
is
ongoing
is
among
the
most
important
circumstances
in
forming
our
analysis.
the
scope
and
duration
of
an
emergency
depends
on
the
context
including
the
type
of
dispute,
the
type
of
weapon
employed
and
the
medical
state
of
the
victim.
the
formality
or
informality
of
the
interaction
also
sheds
lights
on
its
purpose.
in
addition,
the
statements
and
actions
of
both
the
decelerant
and
interrogators
provide
important
evidence
about
the
interrogation's
primary
purpose.
in
this
case,
we
conclude
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
interrogation
was
to
address
an
ongoing
emergency,
first,
the
circumstances.
here,
an
arm
shooter
whose
motive
for
and
location
was
unknown
had
mortally
--
mortally
wounded
covington
within
a
few
blocks
and
a
few
minutes
of
where
the
police
found
him.
unlike
the
domestic
violence
situation
in
davis,
this
disputes
possible
scope
and
thus
the
emergency
potentially
threatened
the
police
in
the
public.
this
case
also
involved
a
gun.
turning
to
the
statements
and
actions
of
the
parties,
we
first
did
consider
the
decelerant.
the
police
found
covington
lying
in
a
gas
station
parking
lot,
bleeding
from
a
mortal
--
mortal
gunshot
wound
and
statements
were
punctuated
with
questions
about
when
emergency
medical
services
would
arrive.
we
cannot
say
that
a
person
in
his
situation
would
have
had
a
primary
--
primary
purpose
of
providing
testimonial
statements.
that
is
statements
to
establish
or
prove
past
events
potentially
relevant
to
later
criminal
prosecution.
for
their
part,
the
police
responded
to
a
call
that
a
man
had
been
shot.
they
did
not
know
why,
where
or
when
the
shooting
had
occurred,
the
shooter's
location
or
anything
else
about
the
crime.
they
asked
exactly
the
type
of
questions
necessary
to
enable
them
to
lead
an
ongoing
emergency.
nothing
in
covington's
responses
indicated
that
there
was
no
emergency
or
that
the
emergency
had
ended.
finally,
this
situation
was
quite
informal.
the
officers
all
arrived
at
different
times
as
repetitive
questions
and
generally
did
not
conduct
the
structured
interrogation.
for
the
four
going
reasons,
we
hold
that
covington
statements
were
not
testimonial
and
that
their
admission
at
bryant's
trial
did
not
violate
the
confrontation
clause.
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgement.
justice
scalia
and
justice
ginsburg
have
each
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
