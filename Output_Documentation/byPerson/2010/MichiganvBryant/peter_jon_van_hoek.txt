mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
anthony
covington
made
his
statement
to
the
officers
at
the
gas
station,
not
just
once
but
several
times,
he
reasonably
understood
that
he
was
providing
the
police
information
as
to
events
which
had
concluded
a
half
our
earlier
at
a
location
six
blocks
away
with
an
understanding
that
that
information
would
assist
the
police
in
locating,
apprehending
and
potentially
prosecuting
the
person
he
felt
was
responsible
for
his
injury.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
and
apprehending,
arresting.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
well,
certainly.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
the
federal
constitution--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--the
reason,
your
honor,
that
the
confrontation
clause
is
the
fundamental,
part
of
the
fundamental
law
of
the
country,
and
what
this
court,
i
believe,
decided
in
crawford
and
then
applied
to
situations,
similar
situation
in
davis
and
hammon,
is
that
where
you
have
a
statement
from
a
witness
to
a
police
officer
as
part
of
the
questioning
and
that
statement
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
testimony
that
witness
would
have
given
had
he
or
she
appeared
at
trial
and
been
subject
to
cross-examination,
then
the
admission
of
that
statement
at
trial
even
under
hearsay
exception
without
cross-examination
effectively
allows.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
because
i
think
what
this
court
said
in
crawford
and
davis
is
that
is
the
primary
test,
that
is
what
our
constitution
requires
to
allow
the
reliability,
the
believability,
the
trustworthiness
of
that
evidence
to
be
evaluated
by
a
jury.
we
don't
have
a
situation--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--it
would
be
wiped
out
if
the
statement
at
issue
qualifies
as
testimonial
under
the
test
this
court
announced
in
crawford
and
davis.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
well,
i
would
have
to
say
the
constitutional
justification
of
that
is
the
reason
why
the
right
of
constitution
isn't
in
the
constitution.
where
you
had
a
situation
in
english
common
law
where
magistrates
were
allowed
to
go
out,
interview
witnesses,
come
into
court
and
present
their
memory,
their
version
of
what
the
witness
said
as
substantive
evidence
in
the
case
and
the
defense
is
not
allowed
to
question
or
talk.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
certainly
don't
think
crawford
and
davis
bars
all.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
believe
this
court
in
crawford
and
davis
correctly
established
that
line,
in
a
situation
like
this
where
it
is
the
response
of
a
citizen
to
questions
from
a
police
officer,
that
you
look
primarily,
as
footnote
1
indicates,
to
the
content
of
that
statement.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
well,
this
court
certainly
has
suggested
that
in
giles,
that
a
dying
declaration
might
be
an
exception
to
crawford
as
an
exception
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
framing.
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
that
question
in
this
case
because
this
is
not
a
dying
declaration.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
yes.
and
i
think
maybe
the
dying
declaration
as
being
in
that
situation
is
an
indication.
what
is
different
about
dying
declaration
from
all
these
other
hearsay
exceptions
is
that
at
the
point
at
which
the
statement
is
made
it
is
an
understanding
that
that
witness
will
not
be
testifying,
that
there
is
no
potential
that
that
witness
will
appear
in
court
in
person.
there
is
--
the
police
officers
in
any
of
these
situations
speaking
to
the
witness,
when
a
police
officer
arrives
at
the
scene
they
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
is
going
to
occur
months
later.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
that's
true.
i
think
that's
--
that's
also
the
--
the
--
the
background
of
most
hearsay
exceptions
is
that
for
the
circumstances
that
there
is
some
degree
of
inherent
reliability
to
that
statement
which
excuses
the
absence
of
cross-examination
if
the
witness
is
unavailable.
but--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--yes.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
a
--
a
--
a
statement
by
a
witness
that
is
a
narrative--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--no.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
no,
no.
the
911
--
well,
the
fact
there's
a
911--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
someone
calls
911
and
makes
a
report,
whether
they
are
talking
about
an
ongoing
situation
or
reporting
of
a
past
event,
makes
that
somehow
inherently
more
reliable
than
if
they
had
used
another
medium.
i
think
the
distinction
in
davis
is
that
the
beginning
of
the
911
call
that
mr.
contra
was
making
to
the
case
was
not
relating
past
events
it
was
a
declaration
of
emergency.
it
was
a
call
for
immediate
assistance.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
don't
--
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
basis
on
which
this
court
held
it
was
nontestimonial.
i
think
this
court
held
it
was
nontestimonial
because
it
was
not
what
a
witness
does
during
a
trial.
it
was--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--yes.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
well,
in
--
in
this
case,
when
--
when
--
when
the
initial
attempted
admission
of
this
evidence,
at
the
preliminary
exam,
when
it
met
a
hearsay
objection,
the
prosecutor
at
that
point
argued
that
it
was
admissible
under
michigan
evidence
rules
as
either
an
excited
utterance
and/or
a
dying
declaration.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
well,
they
argued
dying
declaration,
the
judge
sustained
the
objection
and
said
he
has
not
established
the
foundation
for
either
one
of
those.
the
prosecutor
at
that
point
established
a
foundation
solely
for
excited
utterance.
the
judge
ruled
the
evidence
admissible
and
specifically
said
admissible
only
as
excited
utterance.
at
that
point
the
prosecution
abandoned
any
attempt,
threw
out
the
state
court
proceedings
to
say
this
was
a
dying
declaration.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
what--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--i'm
not
--
if
i
--
if
i
meant
--
if
you
took
what
i
said
as
a
concession,
what
i
said
is
that
this--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--and
i--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--if
i
--
if
you
took
my
answer
to
the
prior
question
to
say
that
i
conceded
that,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
when
i
was
first
asked
the
question
about
dying
declaration,
i
pointed
out
that
this
court
in
giles
indicated
that
that
may
be
an
exception
to
the
confrontation
clause.
and
i
agree--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--no,
giles
is
not--
justice
ginsburg
--
any
way
to
the
--
that
the
--
that
the
purpose
of
the
killing
was
to
get
rid
of
the
witness's
testimony.
giles
made
the
statement
maybe
dying
declaration
is
an
--
is
an
exception
to
our
crawford's
jurisprudence.
yes.
and
as
you
said,
this
court
has
not
reached
that
question
directly,
and
--
and
there
is
no
need
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case
because
this
is
not
a
dying
declaration
case.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
agree.
i'm
not
--
i
clearly
don't--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--yes,
yes.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
and
it
has
not
been
decided.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
think
there
are
situations
where
--
where
the
police
are
coming
in
and
asking
questions,
is
there
a
threat
here?
is
there
someone
here
who
is
--
who
is
threatening
you?
is
there
someone
here
who
is
coming
to
threaten
you
or
other
people?
they
may
be
able
to
get
some
background
information
to
put
it
in
context,
but
we
don't
have
anything
like
that
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
think
the
line
would
be
drawn
if
those
were
the
only
statements,
he's
hitting
me
with
a
baseball
bat,
versus
he
--
he
just
hit
me
with
a
baseball
bat
and
he
just
left.
i
think
the
line
is
clearly
drawn
in
davis
between
the
hitting
me
with
a
baseball
bat
would
be
nontestimonial--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--i
think
that
in
the
absence
of
any
statement
by
the
witness
alleging
that
there
is
any
current
ongoing
imminent
danger,
if
the
witness
only
gives
a
statement
that
relates
to
past
completed
events,
then
it's
not
a
showing
of
--
of
an
ongoing
emergency.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
that
statement
standing
alone
i
would
say
that
that
is
past,
purely
past.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
are
we
referring
to
a
specific
person?
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
well,
i
--
i
--
i
would
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
--
that
the
--
the
--
the
discussion
of
verbs
tense
and
past
tense,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
--
is
the
--
is
the
determining
factor.
it's
certainly
important,
certainly
a
relevant
consideration
in--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--yes.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances
together,
it's
a
--
it's
--
and
going
to
the
primary
purpose
is,
is
the
witness
declaring
some
type
of
emergency,
some
sort
of
imminent
harm
and
requesting
the
police
to
render
assistance
to
alleviate
that,
to
protect
him
--
him
or
her.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
would
say
that's
our
case
and
i
would
say
that
was
testimonial.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
well,
i
would
--
in
that
situation,
nothing
about
the
davis
rule
and
nothing
about
the
confrontation
clause
precludes
the
police
from
taking
that
information
and
asking
those
further
questions.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
but
if
the
statement
is
made
to
the
police
that
a
sniper
has
said
he's
--
he
is
on
the
verge
of
shooting
other
people,
because
he
just
shot
someone,
i
would
say
that's
certainly
a
declaration
of
an
emergency
and
certainly
would
be
non-testimonial
under
the
--
under
the
test
of
davis.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
--
there
is
nothing
--
there
is
nothing
but
the
emergency
rule.
i
think
that
when
--
hen
the
police
are
investigating,
a
reported
crime
and
getting
statements
from
witnesses,
whether
the
victim
or
another
witness--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--well
they
are
investigating.
they
are
seeking
information
in
which
they
will
do
their
job,
which
is
to
go
try
to
arrest
someone
and
see
what
the
situation
is.
and
they
are
getting
narratives
of
past
events
from
witnesses.
and
they're
asking
on
it.
and
nothing
about
this
rule
prevents
them
from
doing
that.
but
the
admissibility
--
for
them
to
be
able
to
come
into
court,
and
they
alone
to
come
into
court
and
say
this
is
what
this
witness
told
me
and
this
is
what
this
witness
told
me
and
this
is
what
this
witness
told
me
--
and
by
the
way,
defense
counsel,
those
witnesses
are
not
going
to
be
here
today,
and
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
ask
them
what
they
meant
by
that
or
whether
they
were
telling
the
truth.
no.
mr.
bryant
at
this
trial
was
never
able
to
question
mr.
covington.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
well--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--but
the
line
this
court
drew
in
crawford
and
davis--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--i
don't
believe--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--those
examples
you
just
gave,
are
not
statements
made
during
police
questioning.
if
we're
talking
about--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--what
--
the
difference
that
made
in
davis
is
that
the
--
the
definition
of
testimonial
is
not
across
the
board.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
roberts.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
roberts.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
yes.
as
you
said,
in
crawford
this
court
looked
at
that
and
though
the
protections
of
the
hearsay
rule,
and
the
focus
under
the
roberts
standard
of
whether
a
statement
fell
within
a
firmly
established
hearsay
rule,
was
not
sufficient
under
the
constitution,
under
the
confrontation
clause,
to
--
to
alleviate
the
fact
that
there
--
there
is
no
cross-examination.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
well,
i'd
have
to
go
back
to
my
answer
that
the
confrontation
clause
is
the
primary
law
of
the
country,
not
state
hearsay
objection
rules.
many
of
the
examples
--
the
coconspirator
--
the
coconspirator
exception
is
not
going
to
be
applicable
in
many
cases
because
those
statements
aren't
made
to
police
officers,
they
are
made
to
coconspirators
in
the
course
of
a
conspiracy.
that
is
the
foundational
requirement.
it
is
not
going
to
eliminate
hearsay
rules.
statements
made
to
private
citizens;
statements
made
in
a
lot
of
different
circumstances
are
still
going
to
be
evaluated
solely
under
hearsay
rules,
because
they
are
not
testimonial,
because
they
are
not
the
product
of
police
--
police
questioning.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
yes.
they
have
to.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
my
position
is
that
where
the
witness
has
not
provided
any
information
to
the
police
indicating
that
there
is
an
immediate
threat,
either
volunteered
to
the
police
or
in
response
to
questions
from
the
police,
saying
is
there
a
threat?
where
--
in
this
case,
no
question
is
asked--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--no,
not
at
all.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
yes,
and
if
the
answers,
no
matter
what
questions
they
asked,
if
the
answers
all
are
a
narrative
of
past
events,
then
that
qualifies
as
testimonial
because
it
is
the
--
the
equivalent.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
no.
i
think
my
answer
was
that
--
that
if
the
witness
is
declaring
an
emergency
and
telling
the
police
that
there
is--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--not
in
those
words
but
--
but
in
comparison
to
what
--
mrs.
davis
said,
which
is
that
he's
beating
me
up.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
no.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
well,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
--
a
statement
from
the
--
from
the
witness
at
that
point
of
the
police
officer
asking
him,
is
john
jones
here?
is
he
threatening
you?
do
you
know
where
he
is
right
now?
do
you
know
what
he
is
intending
to
do?
and
the
answers
are
"yes,
he
has
a
gun,
he's
right
over
there.
"
"he's
going
to
shoot
someone
else.
"
"he
said
he
was
going
to
shoot
someone
else.
"
that's
different.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
because
the
--
or
the
petitioner's
position
here
is
that
the
situation
itself,
standing
alone--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--well,
certainly
if
the
police
have
come
on
the
scene
and
multiple
students
have
been
shot.
you
would
think
that
the
primary
purpose,
if
the
primary
purpose,
if
you
take
that
as
a
test.
that
their
primary
purpose
of
questioning
the
witness
is
to
determine
whether
there
is
an
emergency,
they
are
going
to
ask
those
questions.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
and
they
can
ask
all
those
questions.
as
justice
scalia
said,
there
is
nothing
in
this
court's
opinion
in
davis
and
nothing
in
my
position
that
prevents
the
police.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
think
there
is
an
ongoing
emergency
that
a
statement
that
is
non-testimonial
relating
to
an
ongoing
emergency,
when
there
is
some
indication
from
the
statement
made
by
the
witness
that
such
--
that
there
is
some
immediacy.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
no,
i
don't
think
just
from
the
circumstances.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i
don't
agree.
if
that's
the
case,
any
report,
as
justice
scalia
said
previously,
any
report
of
a
past
crime
certainly
raises
the
potential
that
a
subsequent
crime
will
occur.
if
that's
the
case--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--well,
again,
i
think
that
if
all
it
is
that
the
principal
shot
someone
before,
that
basically
is--
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
--well,
if
they
ask
those
questions
and
the
principal
is
still
inside
and
there
is
an
indication.
mr.
peter
jon
van
hoek
i'm
not
taking
the
position
that
they
have
to
go
through
a
whole
list
of
questions
before
they
can
do
anything.
if
you
go
to
a
situation
and
a
student
says
the
principal
shot
someone,
certainly
nothing
about
the
davis
rule
stops
them
from
immediately
running
into
the
school
and
determining
if
there
is
a
situation
there.
