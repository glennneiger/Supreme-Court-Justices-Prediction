justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
a
situation
like
this,
do
you
think
it's
meaningful
to
ask
what
the
primary
purpose
of
the
victim
was
when
he
responded
to
the
police
and
said
who
shot
him?
you
have
a
man
who
has
just
been
shot.
he
has
a
wound
that's
going
to
turn
out
to
be
fatal,
and
he's
lying
there
on
the
ground
bleeding
profusely,
and
he
says:
my
primary
purpose
in
saying
this
is
so
they
can
respond
to
an
ongoing
emergency?
no,
but
i
also
have
the
purpose
of
giving
them
information
that
could
be
used
at
trial,
but
it's
a
little
less
--
that's
a
little
bit
less
my
purpose
than
responding
to
the
ongoing
emergency.
it
seems
like
it's
totally
artificial.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
we
established
that
this
was
a
dying
declaration
and
was
made
in
contemplation
of
death,
would
it
be
barred
by
crawford?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
that,
but
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
would
be
consistent
with
crawford
if
it
were
a
dying
declaration,
which
the
court
has
suggested.
what
does
that
tell
you
about
the
understanding
of
the
scope
of
the
confrontation
right
at
the
time
when
the
sixth
amendment
was
adopted?
because
a
dying
declaration
may
very
well
be
testimonial
under
--
is
likely
to
be
testimonial
under
the
crawford
test.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
there
be--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--can
there
be
a
situation
in
which
the
primary
purpose
for
a
statement
or
for
the
question
that
elicits
the
statement
is
to
respond
to
an
ongoing
emergency
rather
than
to
gather
evidence
for
subsequent
use
in
a
legal
proceeding
when
the
statement
relates
to
something
that
has
occurred,
perhaps
just
a
few
seconds
before,
but
it
relates
to
something
that
has
occurred
as
opposed
to
something
that
is
occurring
at
that
very
moment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i
understand,
but
we
need
to
know
where
to
draw
the
line.
so,
you
concede
that
the
line
is
not
between
a
statement
about
he
is
hitting
me
with
a
baseball
bat
as
opposed
to
he
just
finished
hitting
me
with
a
baseball
bat
and
is
headed
out
the
door?
that
is
not
where
the
line
is
drawn.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
really
would
like
a
clear
answer
to
this.
is
--
can
there
be
an
ongoing
emergency
where
the
statement
relates
--
where
the
statement
recounts
something
that
has
occurred,
not
something
that
is
occurring?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
they
get
a
9-1-1
call.
there's
--
a
man
has
just
been
shot
on
the
corner
of
fifth
and
main.
they
go
to
fifth
and
main;
they
find
a
man
there;
he's
shot;
he's
bleeding
profusely;
he's
in
shock;
and
they
know
nothing
more
about
what's
happened.
and
they
say,
well,
what
happened?
well,
he
shot
me.
who
shot
you?
it's
john
jones.
now
what
about
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
police
under
those
circumstances
don't
know
whether
john
jones
is
going
on
a
shooting
spree;
this
is
just
the
first
of
numerous
victims.
maybe
it's
a
gang
fight.
he's
shot
one
member
of
an
opposing
gang;
now
he's
going
to
go
shoot
another
member
of
an
opposing
gang.
how
can
they
--
how
can
you
answer
that
question,
what's
the
primary
purpose
there?
i
just
don't
understand
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i'm
still
trying
to
understand
your
conception
of
the
scope
of
the
ongoing
emergency
doctrine.
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
your
idea
is
that
the
police
have
to
have
specific
evidence
that
there
is
an
immediate
threat
of
physical
violence
that
they
need
to
respond
to,
in
order
for
the
ongoing
emergency
doctrine
to
apply?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
in
a
case
of
doubt
they
can't
do
it.
so
if
they
don't
know
whether
there
is
an
immediate
threat
or
not
an
immediate
threat
then
that
doesn't
fall
within
that
exception;
that's
your
idea?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
you
just
said
that
wasn't
the
test,
past
versus
present.
didn't
you
say
that
about
10
minutes
ago,
it's
not
the
difference
between
something
that
is
taking
place
and
something
that
has
taken
place?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
witness
has
to
say
there
is
an
emergency?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
is
a
report
of
shooting
at
a
school,
and
the
police
go
and
they
find
two
students
lying
on
the
ground.
one
is
dead
and
the
other
is
severely
wounded
and
they
ask
the
one
who
is
wounded
did
it.
"it's
john
jones".
now
does
that
--
is
that
an
ongoing
emergency?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
why
is
it
not
an
ongoing
emergency?
what
would
be
an
ongoing
emergency?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
is
a
very
specific
information.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
there
are
three
students
who
have
been
shot,
four
students
who
have
been
shot,
but
nobody
says,
well,
i
think
he's
still
in
the
building,
he
may
have
an
interest
in
shooting
some
more
students?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
of
course
that's
the
emergency.
because
how
are
they
going
to
find
the
person
that
they
are
looking
for
if
they
don't
know
who
it
is.
what
if
he's
thrown
away
his
gun?
of
course
if
they
come
upon
him
and
he
has
the
gun
in
his
hand,
then
it's
not
a
question.
what
if
he
has
disposed
of
it?
they
have
to
know
who
to
go
for.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
totally
puzzled
now
as
to
when
you
think
there
is
an
ongoing
emergency
and
when
there
isn't.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
made
by
the
declarant.
it
can't
be
inferred
from
the
circumstances.
