justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
would
have
us
make
a
statute-by-statute
determination
as
to
what
we
think
congress
intended
whenever
it
uses
the
term
"notice
of
appeal".
and
perhaps
that's
not
a
big
problem,
if
there
are
not
a
lot
of
other
statutes
like
this
one
that
use
the
term
"notice
of
appeal"
and
with
respect
to
which
it
is
not
settled
whether
it
is
jurisdictional.
do
you
have
any
sense
of
how
many
others
there
might
be?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
happens
if
the
veteran
doesn't
get
notice?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
veteran
is
so
profoundly
disabled
that
the
veteran
can't
file
the
notice
of
appeal
within
120
days
after
the
notice
of
the
decision,
at
what
point
after
the
120-day
period
would
the
right
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
be
cut
off?
would
this
go
on
potentially
indefinitely?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
happens
if
the
--
if
the
notice
of
decision
is
mistakenly
mailed
to
the
wrong
address,
comes
back
undeliverable,
and
no
further
notice
is
sent?
your
--
you
position
is,
once
the
120
days
expires,
the
veteran
is
out
of
luck?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
but
what
if
it's
just
lost
in
the
mail?
what
if
it
is
sent
to
the
right
address,
but
it's
lost
in
the
mail
or
not
received
by
the
veteran?
what
is
the
veteran
supposed
to
do?
call
every
--
every
week
to
see
whether
a
decision
has
been
issued?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
concerns
the
120-day
time
limit
for
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
veterans
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
david
henderson
was
a
veteran.
he
applied
for
veteran's
benefits
but
those
were
denied
by
the
veteran's
administration
so
he
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
with
the
veterans
court
but
he
missed
the
120-day
deadline
by
a
couple
of
days.
he
argued
that
his
late
filing
should
be
excused
because
it
was
caused
by
his
illness
but
the
veterans
court
held
that
the
120-day
time
limit
is
jurisdictional
and
can't
be
relaxed
under
any
circumstances.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
affirmed.
as
we
explained
in
an
opinion
that
is
filed
today,
we
hold
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
120-day
time
limit
be
treated
as
a
jurisdictional
provision.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
