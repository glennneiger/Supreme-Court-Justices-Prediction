justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
what
percentage
of
the
cases
is
there
a
representative?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
say
--
you
say
that
80
percent
of
the
time
there
is
a
registered--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--advocate
or
counsel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
stone
was
somewhat
mixed,
though.
it
was
a
motion
for
reconsideration
of
the
agency,
whether
or
not
that
told
the
time
to
go
to
the
court;
am
i
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
sort
of
a
hybrid
problem
in
the
context
of
justice
ginsburg's
dichotomy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
won't
be
disastrous
if
they
can
ask
to
be
registered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
helped
or
hurt
in
making
that
argument
when
this
is
not
de
novo
review?
i
think
you
are
helped.
if
it's
not
de
novo
review
that
helps--
