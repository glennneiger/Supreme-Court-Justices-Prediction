chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-1036,
henderson
v.
shinseki.
ms.
blatt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
appreciate
all
those
points,
but
counting
--
cutting,
perhaps,
the
other
way
is
that
it's
not
a
real
adversarial
system
before
you
get
to
that
stage.
it's
a
collaborative
effort,
the
veterans'
administration
and
the
--
the
individual.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
seems
to
me
may
counterbalance
a
little
bit
the
fact
that
the
veterans
are
uncounseled.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
--
unless
i
am
missing
the
point
of
my
colleague's
question,
it's
two
different
issues.
of
course
they
don't
participate
in
the
court.
they
are
not
lawyers.
but
it's
not
clear
to
me
why
they
wouldn't
participate
at
least
in
the
process
of
saying,
you've
got
to
file
your
notice
and
here's
where
you
file
it.
are
you
saying
they
don't
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
do
it
regularly
and
they
--
every
now
and
then
they
file
it
in
the
wrong
place?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
that
works.
you've
got
somebody
there
and
he
has
been
telling
them
where
to
file
it
and
file
it
and
file
it,
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
tells
him
to
file
it
someplace
else?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
clear
statement
rule
are
you
talking
about?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
remember
that.
i
remember
that.
i
thought
that
that
was
a
prospective
bright-line
rule.
it's
kind
of
hard
to
apply
a
new
bright-line
rule
retrospectively.
i
understood
what
we
said
in
those
cases
to
be:
look,
congress,
we
are
tired
of
trying
to
sort
out
this
ambiguity.
from
now
on,
if
you
want
it
to
be
treated
as
jurisdictional,
tell
us
it's
jurisdictional.
it
makes
sense
prospectively,
but
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
do
that
to
statues
that
were
passed
before
we
announced
our
bright-line
preference.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
understand
changing
the
subject,
but
in
my
question,
you
invoke
the
bright-line
rule
of
arbaugh
that
the
statute
should
say
"jurisdictional".
and
i'm
just
saying
that
only
makes
sense
prospectively.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--of
course,
in
bowles
it
was
from
an
article
iii
court
to
another
article
iii
court.
here,
although
we
are
dealing
with
an
article
i
court,
there
are
characteristics
of
what
you
might
call
internal
agency
review.
the
court
is
specialized
with
respect
to
veterans'
affairs,
and
there
are
particular
standards
for
review
that
you
don't
find
when
you
are
talking
about
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
it's
related
--
just
to
get
everything
out
on
the
table,
it's
related
to
the
same
point
that
i
thought
was
significant
in
bowles:
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
time
limitation
that
lawyers
had
long
recognized
as
being,
you
know,
a
drop-dead
date.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
made
some
sense.
when
you
look
at
the
statistics,
when
you
get
into
this
court,
the
veterans
almost
always
win,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
point
was
the
exact
opposite:
that
if
you
--
they
almost
always
win,
you
assume
that
congress
wouldn't
want
to
cut
them
off,
because
it's
--
if
only
1
percent
of
the
veterans
appealing
win,
you
might
understand
an
absolute
rule,
because
they're
not
--
as
--
statistically,
we
are
not
losing
much.
but
if,
as
i
understand
to
be
the
case,
about
80
percent
of
them
win,
you
might
cut
them
a
little
slack
on
appealing
because
it
is
a
very
significant
part
of
the
--
the
process.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
reversal
rate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
any
idea
what
the
normal
rule
is
from
district
court
to
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
sense
some
confusion
here,
given
what
you
and
your
friend
have
said.
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
"counseled"?
i
mean,
if
you
have
somebody
from
the
american
legion
that
is
telling
this
person,
here
is
what
you
need
to
do,
does
he
get
a
notice,
or
are
you
talking
about
the
situation
where
somebody
comes
in
and
says,
i'm
--
well,
i'm
this
person's
lawyer,
or
i'm
representing
him
in
some
other
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
blatt,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
want
to
clear
up
this
represent
--
represented
business.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understood
you
to
say
in
the
--
your
opening
that
represented
--
most
of
these
people
are
not
represented,
and
they're
--
to
the
extent
the
american
legion
participates,
they
don't
get
notice
of
the
order
that
triggers
the
120
days.
now,
i
understood
mr.
miller
to
tell
us
that
80
percent
of
the
people
have
registered
representatives
and
they
do
get
notice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
that
person
helping
him
registered
as
a
representative?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
is
that
the
exception,
then?
i
mean,
mr.
miller
tells
us
that
80
percent
of
the
people
do
have
registered
representatives.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
matter
how
far
away
they
are
if
he
gets
notice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
