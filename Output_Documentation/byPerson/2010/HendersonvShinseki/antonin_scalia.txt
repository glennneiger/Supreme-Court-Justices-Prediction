justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
thought
bowles
was
a
nice,
clear
case.
i
mean,
you
could
always
find
some
distinction
in
the
next
case,
and
i
thought
the
object
of
bowles
was
to
say
if
it's
a
limit
on
appeal,
it's
jurisdictional.
that
would
--
and
that's,
i
gather,
what
the
federal
circuit
took
it
to
mean.
and
i
would
have
done
that
if
i
was
down
there,
probably.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
the
social
security
context
--
it
doesn't
speak
of
an
appeal,
does
it?
it
talks
of
a
civil
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you're
right
that
there
is
--
you
know,
there
is
a
parallel
in
what's
going
on,
but
the
statute
does
not
call
it
an
appeal.
it
calls
it
bringing
a
civil
action
to
challenge
the
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
go
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
although
that
--
although
that
would
happen
when
he
appeals
from
the
--
from
the
veterans'
appeals
court,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
one
to
get
to
the
veterans
court
is
120
days,
which
is
a
lot
of
time.
do
you
know
of
any
other
time
limit
that
is
that
long?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
for
appeal.
for
appeal.
do
you
know
of
any
other
appeal
statute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
the
latter
i
can
understand,
but
i
don't
have
a
whole
lot
of
sympathy
for
--
i
mean,
when
he
loses
below
he
gets
a
notice
that
says
specifically
he
has
to
file
an
appeal
with
this
court,
doesn't
it?
doesn't
it
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
sends
it
--
he
sends
it
to
the
va
instead
of
to
this
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
equitable
tolling
even
cover
that
situation?
it
would
seem
to
me
--
i'd
say
it
told
you
where
to
file;
you
simply
didn't
follow
the
instructions.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
don't
navigate
it
entirely
on
the
system.
i
mean,
isn't
there
usually
assistance
from
a
nongovernmental
organization
such
as
the
american
legion
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
right.
do
they
drop
them
like
a
hot
potato
once
the
va
portion
is
over?
they
don't
counsel
about
how
to
file
an
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
normally
he
is
not
assisted
--
he
is
not
assisted
by
one
of
these
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
a
lawyer.
i'm
talking
about
advice
from
somebody
that's
in
the
american
legion.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
whenever
we
have
time
limits
in
the
future
that
do
not
contain
any
explicit
provision
for
waiver
of
failure
to
meet
those
time
limits,
you
are
asking
us
to
find
that
all
of
those
are
non-jurisdictional?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
it
a
filing
requirement?
it's
--
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
an
appeal.
it's
a
requirement
for
appeal.
whenever
there
is
an
appeal
deadline
that
does
not
have
an
exception
for
--
you
know,
you
--
you
can
get
it
extended
for
10
days
or
what-not
--
whenever
there
is
no
exception,
you
want
us
to
hold
it's
not
jurisdictional?
justice
antonin
scalia
although
you
are
willing
to
--
to
have
that
happen
when
there
is
an
appeal
from
--
from
the
first
appeal,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
miller,
do
you
really
think
congress
thought
about
this?
do
you
think
the
members
of
congress
who
voted
for
this
bill
thought
about
this
--
this
rather
narrow
point,
about
whether
if
you
file
too
late
it's
jurisdictional?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
don't
we
pretty
much
have
to
go
on
what
they
wrote?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
bet
you
a
dollar
to
a
donut
that
--
that
nobody
thought
about
this
narrow
--
narrow
issue.
so
it
--
it
ought
to
be
a
question
of
--
of
what
this
language
ought
to
be
taken
to
mean.
what's
its
fairest
reading?
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
means
you
win,
but
--
but
surely
that's
the
issue,
not
--
not
what,
whether
--
whether
congress
could
have
been
so
mean.
they
didn't
think
of
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
say
that
a
copy
of
the
notice
is
also
sent
to
the
representative,
the
american
legion
or
whoever,
who
has
been
representing
the
veteran?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
congress
--
let's
assume
we
--
we
come
out
with
a
decision
against
the
veteran.
could
congress
change
the
rule
retroactively,
including
for
this
poor
fellow.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
wouldn't
be
contrary
to
any
of
our
decisions
because
the
government
is
the
defendant
and
is
essentially
waiving
its
sovereign
immunity?
would
that
be
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
there
will
have
been
a
final
decision
in
this
case,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
can
congress
say,
you
know,
go
back
and
do
it
over
again
and
give
it
to
this
guy?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
acts
do
you
think
would
be
swept
up
into
a
rule
that
we
adopted
here,
that
not
all
limitations
on
appeal
time
are
jurisdictional?
the
hobbs
act
cases;
what
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
sure
we
would
say
these
are
veterans,
and
i'm
sure
there
are
other
categories
of
sympathetic
people
who
might
come
under
the
hobbs
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
haven't
answered
my
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
hobbs
act--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
dog
ate
it,
maybe.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
give
them
notice?
i
mean,
isn't
the
very
giving
of
--
of
notice--
justice
antonin
scalia
--an
indication
that
they
are
expected
to
do
something?
