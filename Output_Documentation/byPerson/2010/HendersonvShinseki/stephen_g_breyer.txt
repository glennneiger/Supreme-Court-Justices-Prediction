g.

are
we
supposed
to
still
pay
some
attention
to
what
we
think
congress
would
have
intended?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
if
the
answer
is
"certainly",
how
likely
do
you
think
it
is
that
congress
would
have
intended
its
statutes,
in
an
ordinary
case
where
two
big
businesses
are
suing
each
other
and
they
have
already
had
a
day
in
court
and
now
one
of
them
wants
to
appeal
and
congress
writes
in,
if
you
miss
the
deadline,
you
can
have
it
extended
through
excusable
neglect,
and
you
can
even
have
it
extended
much
later
if
nobody
got
a
notice.
that's
with
two
big
businesses.
but
if
you
have
someone
who
served
his
country
and
was
wounded
and
has
post-traumatic
stress
syndrome
or
schizophrenia,
to
that
person,
you
say
--
who
has
never
had
a
day
in
court:
"if
you
don't
meet
the
deadline,
you're
out,
no
matter
how
excusable
it
is.
"
how
--
who
in
congress
would
have
likely
thought
such
a
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
relevance
of
that,
if
the
veterans
win?
i
mean,
perhaps
they
are
entitled
to
win.
is
the
idea
that
you
would
cut
off
their
right
to
appeal
because
you
are
afraid
they'd
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
mean,
"right"?
i
thought
within
--
first
of
all,
a
donut
costs
a
dollar,
so
i
don't
see
much
appeal
there.
[laughter]
but
--
but
don't
we,
throughout
the
statute
books,
try
to
work
out
from
context,
language,
and
objective
purpose
what
a
reasonable
member
of
congress
would
have
intended,
whether
they
thought
about
it
or
whether
they
did
think
about
it,
which
would
require
x-rays
into
the
brain
that
have
not
yet
been
invented?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
bowles
itself
made
--
made
a
major
point,
which
i
thought
was
relevant.
though
i
didn't
join
it,
i
thought
it
was
relevant.
and
that
is:
we
look
at
the
statute,
if
you
are
looking
at
statute,
and
notice
that
there
are
exceptions
written
into
it.
and
the
fact
that
there
are
exceptions
written
into
it
lends
some
support
to
the
notion
that
we,
as
a
court,
should
not
read
other
exceptions
into
it
that
weren't
mentioned.
that's
something
the
court
seemed
to
emphasize.
and
here,
when
i
looked
at
this
statute,
i
noticed
there
are
no
exceptions
written
into
it.
and
therefore,
following
bowles
rather
than
rejecting
bowles,
it
would
seem
that
bowles
would
support
the
reading
of
this
statute
to
allow
courts
to
read
into
it,
because
they
don't
mention
anything
themselves.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
main
thing.
leaving
that
out
for
a
second,
if
you
--
if
you
thought
there
can't
be
a
rule
that
governs
all
of
the
thousands
of
different,
or
many
different
statutes,
you
should
look
at
the
context.
so
sometimes
you
will
see
that
congress,
given
the
context,
probably
did
want
to
give
the
court
some
leeway
to
make
exceptions
--
where,
for
example,
it
is
no
fault
of
the
litigant
--
and
in
other
instances,
they
didn't.
now
you
have
listed
--
and
bowles,
i
thought,
left
that
open.
but
--
but
if
it
does
leave
it
open,
and
i'm
looking
to
those
factors.
you
have
mentioned
one:
that
this
is
a
long
period
of
time,
120
days.
you
are
right
about
that.
is
there
anything
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
they
found,
one
thing
in
the
text,
was
that
there
were
exceptions
written
in.
that
cuts
against
you.
one
thing
cuts
for
you;
that's
the
length
of
time.
is
there
anything
else
that
cuts
for
you?
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
have
all
of
the
factors
that
you
are
weighing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
supposed
to
happen
--
and
i've
probably
seen
this
on
page
16
of
the
federal
circuit
bar's
amicus
brief.
they
list
about
30
or
40
cases
where
the
veteran
perhaps
was
not
represented,
and
maybe
had
some
stress
syndrome,
whatever
it
is.
he
just
filed
the
paper
in
the
wrong
court
or
the
wrong
agency,
and
that
agency
didn't
get
around
to
returning
it
to
him
in
time
so
he
could
have
met
this
deadline.
what,
in
your
opinion,
is
supposed
to
happen
in
those
circumstances?
just
say,
too
bad,
you
are
out
of
luck;
here
we
are,
you
got
the
wrong
address;
no
recovery?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
these
cases,
actually,
that
they
have
raised
in
the
brief,
the
veteran
does
get
his
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
could
do
it
again.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
these
people
in
footnote
3,
did
they
get
their
appeal
or
didn't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
did
not?
okay.
there's
a
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
we
are
in
a
void
and
the
language
doesn't
have
the
exceptions
--
and
i
think
you
can
distinguish
it
from
these
other
cases,
and
you
have
older
cases
that
says
unless
congress
is
clear,
read
it
as
non-jurisdictional,
and
nobody
could
say
it
was
inequitable
--
or
rather
to
the
contrary,
nobody
could
say
it
was
equitable
to
follow
your
position
here,
why
isn't
there
a
simple
remedy?
we
take
the
opposite
position?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
except
that
for
purposes
of
this,
it
governs.
i'm
just
looking
at
the
parts
of
it
that
did,
in
fact,
make
clear
a
special
nature
of
the
particular
provision
at
issue
in
that
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
these
agency
matters
are
matters
where
there
has
never
been
judicial
input.
this
is
review
of
an
agency
action.
the
agency
takes
an
action.
no
judge
has
looked
at
this.
and
the
first
time
that
you
look
at
the
rulemaking
by
the
agency
under
the
hobbs
act,
i
guess,
is
when
you
go
file
it
in
the
--
in
the
court.
so
if
a
--
if
a
ruling
against
you
here
were
to
encompass
a
ruling
under
most
review
of
agency
action,
would
that
be
such
a
terribly
unworkable
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
the
other
case
that
you
said
decades
of
--
what
is
an
example
of
a
case
where
a
person,
for
an
incredible,
equitable
strong
reason,
such
as
the
wind
blew
his
paper
--
i
don't
know,
some
tremendously
equitable,
strong
reason
he
wants
review
of
an
agency
action--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
right.
the
dog
ate
the
court,
and
the
--
the
--
there
is
a
case
which
says
there
is
no
extension
of
a
--
of
a
deadline
to
file
for
review
of
an
agency
action,
no
matter
how
equitable
your
case.
which
is
our
--
which
is
the
supreme
court
case
that
holds
that?
i
--
i
am
not
familiar
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
only
talking
about
agency
actions,
judicial
review
of
agency
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
know
the
rule,
but
i'm
just
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know
the
rule.
i'm
saying:
what's
the
case?
stone;
i
understand
you
can
make
a
case
of
stone.
is
there
another?
