counsel
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
why
congress
would
have
actually
known
the
difference
that
we
established
in
bowles,
because
when
it
passed
this
statute,
it
was
before
bowles,
wasn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
to
read
of
its
knowledge
of
bowles,
whether
it
meant
jurisdiction
or
not,
is
a
bit
of
a
fiction,
isn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
the
rule?
justice
scalia
said
those
seem
to
establish
a
sensible,
clear
rule,
which
is
if
congress
uses
the
word
"notice
of
appeal",
it
intends
a
jurisdictional
restriction.
that
appears
to
be
the
rule
that
justice
scalia
articulated.
what
would
be
your
rule
or

now

determine
congress's
purpose?
what
--
what
of
our
cases
would

to
that
establishes
different--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
not
sure
what
that
distinction
is.
i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
we
wrote
on
was
the
word
"notice
of
appeal"
in
bowles,
within
a
historical
context.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
only--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
court
to
court.
do
you
have
any
case,
at
the
time
or
before
the
statute
was
passed,
that
ever
held
that
a
statutory
deadline
from
an
agency
to
a
court
appeal
was
jurisdictional
in
the
sense
of
bowles?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
after--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
those
have
different
language.
they
have
barred
language
rather
than
filing
language.
