mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
bowles
v.
russell,
this
court
reaffirmed
its
longstanding
treatment
of
statutory
time
limits
for
the
taking
of
appeals
as
jurisdictional.
section
7266(a)
imposes
a
120-day
time
limit
on
the
taking
of
an
appeal
to
the
veterans'
court,
and
under
the
rule
reaffirmed
in
bowles,
that
time
limit
is
a
limit
on
the
court's
jurisdiction,
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
therefore
be
affirmed.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that
--
that
is
true.
but
what
bowles
emphasized
was
not
just
the
historical
treatment
of
the
particular
time
limit
in
section
2107,
but
the
historical
treatment
of
statutory
time
limits
for
appeals
in
general,
which
is
why
the
court
cited
not
only
2107
cases
but--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--you
are
--
your
are
correct
that
bowles
was
focused
on
court-to-court
appeals,
but
of
course,
in
stone
v.
ins,
which
involved
a
deadline
for
petitioning
of
review
for
the
final
decision
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
the
court
held
that
that
time
limit
was
jurisdictional.
so
i
think
that
the
same
principle
applies
to
appeals
from
agencies--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--it
--
it
is
true
that
functionally,
the
review
that
takes
place
under
section
405(g)
has
a
lot
of
appeal-like
features;
but
what
--
and
so
in
that
sense,
bowen
was
like
a
hybrid
case,
because
you
have
something
that
looks
a
little
bit
like
an
appeal,
but
it
takes
place
in
a
district
court
and
in
a
court
of
original
jurisdiction;
and
most
importantly,
congress
referred
to
it
as
a
civil
action
that
is
commenced
by
the
party
who
is
filing
the
complaint.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
--
the
review
is
very
much
like
--
functionally
like
what
would
happen
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
congress
chose
to
call
it
commencing
a
civil
action.
and
you
commence
it
by
filing
a
complaint,
which
is
quite
different
from
the
notice
of
appeal
here.
on
the
notice
of
appeal,
there
is
a
form
for
doing
it,
or
if
you
don't
use
the
form,
all
it
takes
is
one
sentence.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
certainly.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well
--
i
think
in
evaluating
what
congress
thought
in
1988,
one
factor
that
is
significant
is
that
this
is
taking
place
--
the
veterans'
judicial
review
act
--
against
a
backdrop
of
decades
of
no
judicial
review
whatsoever
of
veterans
--
of
va
administrative
decisions.
and
so
petitioner's
position
is
that
essentially,
congress,
in
one
fell
swoop,
went
from
no
review
whatsoever
to
what
would
be
the
most
forgiving
appeal
deadline
in
the
entire
united
states
code.
and--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--when
you
look
at
decisions
on
the
merits
as
opposed
to
agreed-upon
remands,
the
veterans
win
in
most
cases.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
of
course
not.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
first,
i
would
say
i
think
the
reversal
rate
is
not
necessarily
out
of
line
with
what
you
find
in
other
agency
review
contexts,
but--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
of
cases
that
are
decided
on
the
merits,
about
a
quarter
are
reversed
and
remanded
and
about
34
percent
are
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
--
i
don't
know
the
percentage
there,
but
i
think
in
considering
that
rate,
it's
significant
that
the
great
majority
of
claimants
who
file
claims
in
the
regional
office
are
given
relief
there.
so
only
about
4
percent
of
cases
are
even
appealed
all
the
way
from
the
regional
office
to
the
board,
and
only
another
9
percent
to
the
veterans'
court,
so
--
because
the
board
gives
relief
in
most
cases
before
it.
so--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--there
is
no
indication
that
they
did.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
yes.
and
when
--
when
they
wrote
a
notice
of
appeal
provision
--
and
it
is
clear
from
the
text
as
well
as
from
the
history
that
it
is,
in
fact,
an
appeal
--
that
was
a
considered
decision.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
right.
and
--
and
in
looking
at--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--what
--
what
this
court
has
held,
in
bowles
on
the
one
hand
and
irwin
on
the
other,
is
that
statutory
notice
of
appeal
deadlines
are
presumptively
jurisdictional
and
statutes
of
limitation
are
presumptively
not.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
stone
v.
ins,
which
was
after--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--but
--
but
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
there
was
a
long
history
of
cases
under
the
hobbs
act,
cases
under
more
specialized
statutes,
the
communications
act,
the
federal
power
act,
the
environmental
statutes--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no,
ma'am.
in
fact,
the
hobbs
act
says
a
party
aggrieved
by
the
order
may
seek
review
by
filing
a
petition
for
review.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about,
"and
a
claim
shall
be
barred
if
you
don't.
"
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
would
say
two
things
about
that.
the
first
is
that
there
are
many
statutes,
including
the
hobbs
act,
the
immigration
statute,
that
have
no
provision
for
exceptions.
this
court's
certiorari
deadline
can
be
extended
by
a
justice,
but
there
is
no
provision
for
a
good
cause
exception.
the
extension
provision
that
was
specifically
at
issue
in
section
2107
in
bowles
hadn't
--
wasn't
even
enacted
until
1991.
and
even
with
an
extension,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
other
provision
that
gives
you
as
much
as
120
days
that
you
have
here.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
--
i
guess
i
would
take
issue
with
the
premise
of
what
the
presumption
is
that
bowles
set
up.
bowles
established
a
presumption
that
notice
of
appeal
deadlines
in
statutes
are
jurisdictional,
unless
there
is
something
in
the
text
or
in
the
history
as--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
mean,
what
we
are
emphasizing
is
that
this
is
an
appeal
deadline,
and
in
bowles,
although
it
is
true
there
were
exceptions
there,
that
was
not
something
that
the
court
emphasized
in
its
reasoning.
the
court's
--
the
rationale
behind
bowles
is
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
appeal
deadlines
are
jurisdictional.
and
whatever
one
thinks--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no,
your
honor,
because
in
that
case,
the
120
days
wouldn't
start
running
because
section
7266(a)
says
have
you
to
file
within
120
days
after
the
date
on
which
notice
of
the
decision
is
mailed
pursuant
to
section
7104(e),
and
section
7104(e),
in
turn,
requires
that
notice
be
mailed
to
the
address
of
record
for
the
claimant,
and
also,
incidentally,
requires
that
if
the
claimant
has
an
authorized
representative
in
proceedings
before
the
court,
that
the
notice
also
be
mailed
to
the
representative.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
congress,
in
writing
the
statute,
assumes
that
the
mail
can
be
relied
upon
in
the
ordinary
course
to
be
delivered,
and
so
it
made
provision
for
the
case
in
which
the
mail
--
the
mailing
is
not
made.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
section
7104(e)(2)
says
that
if
the
claimant
has
a
representative,
a
copy
is
mailed.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
it's
about
80
percent.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
80
percent,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
there
--
there
is
a
procedure
for
official
accreditation
of
representatives--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--from
organizations
like
the
american
legion,
and
if
that
person
is
registered
as
the
claimant's
representative
in
the
proceeding
before
the
board,
then
they
would
get
a
copy
of
the
notice
under
7104.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
yes,
that's--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
i
think,
as
i
was--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
was.
i
--
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
that
may
well
be
what
congress
had
in
mind.
but
nonetheless,
the
--
the
rule
established
in
this
court's
cases
is
that
when
a
notice
of
appeal
deadlines
--
and
--
and
i
think
the
point
just
illustrates
that
this
is,
in
fact,
a
notice
of
appeal
deadline
--
notice
of
appeal
deadlines
are
different
from
statutes
of
limitations.
and
whatever
one
thinks
of
the
original
theoretical
underpinnings
of
that
distinction,
it's
a
distinction
that
is
firmly
engrained
in
the
law,
and
this--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--it
could
if
it
chose
to
do
so,
yes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
if
congress--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
believe
that,
since
what's
at
stake
is
--
i
think
ultimately
the
question
would
be
whether
the
government
issues
a
monetary
award
to
him.
and
congress
certainly
has
the
power
to
simply
direct
that
money
be
paid
to
this
claimant,
so
for
sure,
i
think
it
could
direct
that
his
case
be
reopened.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
no.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
right.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
congress
would
have
the
constitutional
power
to
just
award
money.
i
had
understood
justice
scalia's
question
to
be
whether--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--right.
the
question
i
was
trying
to
address
was
whether
congress
could
amend
the
statute
so
as
to
retroactively
reopen
petitioner's
claim.
and
my
answer
was
yes,
it
could
do
that,
if
it
were
to
choose
to
do
so.
now,
the
va,
of
course,
has
submitted
a
proposal
to
congress
for
an
extension
of
the
period
i'm
showing
of
good
cause
up
to
120
days.
the
va's
proposal
would
not
apply
retroactively,
but
congress
in
its
discretion
could
choose.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
right.
although
if
you
--
somebody
who
misses
the
90
days,
my
understanding
of
the
operation
of
this
court's
rule
13
is
that
the
clerk
will
not
accept
your
filing,
a
petition
filed
on
day
91.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
right.
although--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--although
of
course
filing
a
cert
petition
is
a
much
greater
undertaking
than
filing
a
notice
of
appeal.
you
have
to
--
it
is
much
more
than
a
simple
one-line
document.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
it's
significant
that
congress
did
address
the
question
of
mailing
of
notices
of
appeal.
in
1994,
it
amended
section
7266
and
added
a
subsection
(c),
which
unfortunately
is
not
reproduced
in
the
briefs,
but
the
effect
of
that
is
to
give
the
benefit
of
a
mailbox
tool:
that
a
petition
is
deemed
filed
on
the
day
it
is
mailed,
but
only
"if
the
notice
is
properly
addressed
to
the
court.
"
so--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no.
in
those
cases,
the
notice
would
not
have
been
properly
addressed
to
the
court.
it
would
have
been--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--and
certainly--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--and
certainly
one
would
hope
that
the
va
ideally
would
get
those
notices,
figure
out
what
they
are,
and
send
them
to
the
court.
the
problem
that
the
va
encounters
is
that
it
receives
a
tremendous
volume
of
mail,
which
is
not
generally
opened
by
attorneys,
and
it's
often
not
clear
when
it
gets
something
in
the
mail
that
just
says,
i
don't
like
the
decision
in
my
case,
whether
that's
a
notice
of
appeal
to
the
court
or
a
motion
for
reconsideration
or
a
motion
to
file.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
they
did
not.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
and
we
--
we
do
not
deny,
and
in
fact,
it's
true
by
definition
that
to
say
that
there
is
no
equitable
tolling
is
to
say
that
the
rule
would
be
cases
in
which
the
result
is
not
equitable.
but
i
think
if
you
were
to
look
at
just
the
cases
like
the
ones
your
honor
has
identified,
some
of
the
others
in
the
petitioner
brief
and
amicus
brief,
if
you
could
identify
with
no
transaction
costs
what
those
cases
are,
and
were
to
ask
as
a
policy
matter,
should
the
late
filing
be
excused
in
those
cases,
i
think
just
about
everyone
would
say
yes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
is
in
whatever
you
think
of,
the
rule
in
bowles
--
and
we
obviously
believe
that
it
was
correctly
decided,
but
understand
that
not
everyone
takes
that
view--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--but
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
time
limit
is
or
is
not
jurisdictional
would
seem
to
be
a
quintessential
example
of
the
sort
of
issue
where
it
is
more
important
that
the
law
be
settled
then
that
it
be
settled
any
particular
way.
and
the
great
virtue
of
the
rule
in
bowles
is
that
it
provides
clear
guidance
that
appeal
deadlines
are
going
to
be
presumed
to
be
jurisdictional,
and
if
congress
doesn't
want
them
to
be--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--our
position
is
consistent
with
what
we
said
in
reed,
because
reed,
of
course,
did
not
involve
a
time
limit.
reed
involved
a
requirement
that
copyrights
be
registered
before
an
infringement
action
was
brought.
and
what
the
court
said
in
reed
is
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
jurisdictional
label
on
the
statute
does
not
determinative.
what
matters
is
whether
the
type
of
limitation
that
the
statute
imposes
is
one
that's
properly
ranked
as
jurisdictional,
absent
a
label--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
at
issue
in
stone
has
no
provisions
for
extensions.
the
hobbs
act
has
no
provisions
for
extensions.
and
many
of
the
various
agency-specific
statutes
that
i
mentioned
earlier
don't
have
any
provisions
for
extensions.
and
although
this
court
hasn't
ruled
on
them,
petitioner
hasn't
identified
any
decision
from
any
court
of
appeals
holding
that
any
of
those
statutes
is
not
jurisdictional.
so
there
really
is,
as
recognized
in
bowles,
a
uniform
rule
regarding
time
limits
for
the
taking
of
appeals
and
proceedings
like
appeals,
writs
of
certiorari,
and
petitions--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
--
which
ones
would
be
swept
up,
i
suppose,
would
depend
on
what
the
court
were
to
say
in
distinguishing
this
case.
but
there
is
the
hobbs
act;
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--there
--
there
might
well
be,
and
i
think
that's
why
one
of
the
virtues
of
the
rule
in
bowles
is
that
it
provides
clear
guidance
to
congress.
and
in
that
respect
it's
much
preferable
to
a
rule
that
statutes
of
--
or
statutes--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--oh--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
the
hobbs
act,
the
federal
power
act,
the
communications
act,
various
epa
orders
are
reviewed
under
their
specific
--
each
statute
has
its
own
review
procedure.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
--
i
suppose
the
court
could
come
up
with
a
rule.
whether
that
would
prove
to
be
workable,
i
--
i
don't
know.
but
i
think
--
i
guess
what
i
would
say
about
that
is
that
given
that
there
is
an
inherent
arbitrariness
to
any
filing
deadline
and,
therefore,
there
is
to
some
degree
an
inevitable
arbitrariness
in
any
system
of
exceptions
to
the
filing
deadline,
i'm
not--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--it
would
be
clear,
but
it
would
be
contrary
to
stone.
it
would
be
contrary
to
decades
of
uniform
holdings
from
courts
of
appeals
under
all
the
other
statutes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.

but
--
i
mean,
you
are
right
that
that
was
the
issue
in
bowles,
but
--
excuse
me,
in
stone,
but
the
reason
that
that
mattered
in
stone
was
because
the
court
held
that
the
timely
filing
of
a
petition
for
review
and
compliance
with
the
statute
was
a
prerequisite
to
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
don't
know
one
in
the
specific
context
of
agency
actions,
but
of
course
bowles--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--if
--
if
the
time
limit
is
jurisdictional
as
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--there
is
no
authority--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
--
i
don't
know
of
any
from
this
court,
but
of
course
in
the
courts
of
appeals
petitioner
hasn't
identified
any
in
which
an
exception
was
made.
and
then
i
would
point
out
that
bowles
--
in
bowles,
the
petitioner
had
a
very
sympathetic
equitable
claim,
in
that
he
had
done
what
the
district
court
had
told
him
to
do
and
filed
on
the
schedule
given
to
him
by
the
district
court,
and
the
court
held
--
nonetheless
held
that
because
the
time
limit
was
jurisdictional,
there
was
no
authority
to
create
an
exception
to
it.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
ask
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
