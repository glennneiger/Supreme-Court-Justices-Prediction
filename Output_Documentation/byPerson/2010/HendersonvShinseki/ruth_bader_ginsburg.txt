justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
blatt,
you
do
have
a
substantial
hurdle
to
contend
with
in
this
court's
decision
in
bowles
v.
russell,
which
seemed
to
say
if
you
have
a
time
limit
and
it's
statutory,
it
is
mandatory
and
jurisdictional.
so
here,
we
have
a
time
limit
set
by
statute,
not
by
rule,
and
why
doesn't
--
why
isn't
that
dispositive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
is
jurisdictional,
7292?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
much
time
does
7292
give
to
go
from
veterans
court
to
the
federal
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
blatt,
you
are
making
--
you
said
that
the
closest
comparison
is
in
the
social
security,
because
there's
disability
benefits
in
both
cases.
apart
from
one
is
commenced
by
a
complaint
of
--
in
the
district
court,
the
other,
notice
of
appeal,
is
there
any
difference
in
the
brand
of
rebuke
that
is
--
as
i
understand,
the
social
security
review,
although
it
is
by
the
district
court,
is
also
on
the
administrative
record.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
earlier
you
said
that
they
wouldn't
even
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
they
don't
get
notice,
only
the
veterans?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
--
in
bowles
itself
it
was
from
the
district
court
to
a
court
of
appeals,
and
then
we
have
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
court,
and
those
two
provisions
were
cited
in
bowles,
2107.
and
what
is
the
provision
for--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--2101.
those,
as
far
as
i
remember,
were
the
only
provisions
that
were
cited.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
--
that
was
the
federal
circuit's
position
until
bowles,
right?
this
was
an
en
banc
decision
and
it
overruled
two
prior
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
didn't
mention
--
bowles
didn't
mention
anything
like
an
appeal
from
an
agency
where
the
district
court
is
--
is
sitting,
essentially,
as
an
appellate
court.
but
bowles
really
was
dealing
with
court-to-court,
because
it
mentioned
2107
and
2101,
and
i
don't
recall
that
it
mentioned
any
--
anything
other
than
court-to-court
situations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
except
that
--
that
one
is
an
adversarial
proceeding,
immigration
proceeding,
and
the
veteran
is
supposed
to
be
claimant-friendly.
but
i
think
that
the
--
the
--
bowles
is
--
is
a
challenge
for
ms.
blatt.
so
for
you,
it
is
a
social
security
context,
because
it
seems
to
me
the
quality
of
review
is
the
same;
that
is,
what
the
district
court
does
in
a
social
security
disability
case
is
the
same
thing
that
the
veterans'
court
does
in
a
veterans'
disability
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
--
it
is
an
appellant
review,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
the
district
court
goes
on
the
record
before
the
agency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happened
in
this
case?
was
there
--
was
there
a
registered
representative?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
made
a
point
earlier
that,
well,
the
social
security,
there
are
many
resemblances,
but
one
is
founded
by
complaint
and
the
other
by
notice
of
appeal.
it
could
be
that
congress,
having
been
so
kind
to
veterans,
thought:
why
should
we
burden
this
pro
se,
or
at
least
lawyerless,
veteran
with
writing
out
a
complaint?
the
notice
of
appeal
is
just
a
simple
one-line
document.
so
could
that
explain
why
congress
said
you
begin
with
a
notice
of
appeal
instead
of
a
formal
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
no
determination
on
the
merits
whether
this
claimant
should
prevail?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
hasn't
been
aired
because
the
veterans'
court
said
it
had
no
jurisdiction
and
the
federal
circuit
said
that's
right.
so
we
don't
know
if
this
is
good
or
bad
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
congress
couldn't
just
award
money
because
there
has
to
be
an
adjudication.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
scalia
just
asked
you:
could
this
be
--
if
congress
decided
that
this
was
a
harsh
result,
could
it
be
made
retroactive,
but
for
congress
to
say,
well,
just
what
is
it
going
to
rely
on
to
say
whether
it
gives
compensation
or
not?
i
mean,
the
government's
position
was
he
wasn't
entitled
to
compensation
for
home
care,
which
is
what
he
was
receiving.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
length
of
time,
which
is,
you
said,
120
days
--
that's
a
long
time,
but
isn't
it
on
cert?
it's
90
days
plus
60,
right?
so
it's
even
more?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
total
number
of
days
would
exceed
120,
assuming
the
application
is
made--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--application
to
extend
this
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
really
the
only
thing
that
counsels
your
result,
because
in
reed
you
took
--
the
government
took
the
position
that
a
statutory
provision
is
non-jurisdictional
if
it
does
not
speak
in
jurisdictional
terms
and
doesn't
address
the
power
of
the
court.
i
understand
that
was
the
government's
position
in
reed.
today
you
are
saying
that
the
only
thing
that
counsels
your
result
is
the
fact
that
congress
used
the
words
"notice
of
appeal".
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
statute
on
the
time
to
appeal
--
has
any
statute
been
held,
quote,
2107,
that
extensions
are
possible?
is
there
a
121
days
or
whatever,
and
that's
it?
no
extension,
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
are?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
bright,
clear
line
if
we
said:
court
to
court,
bowles
controls;
agency
to
court,
bowles
does
not
control?
that
would
be
a
clear
line.
