ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
forecloses
judicial
review
when
the
very
disability
for
which
a
veteran
seeks
benefits
prevents
the
veteran
from
filing
a
timely
appeal
with
the
veterans
court.
that
decision
is
wrong,
and
for
three
reasons
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
the
deadline
at
issue
in
this
case
is
jurisdictional.
first,
the
statute
contains
no
clear
indication
that
the
deadline
is
jurisdictional.
rather,
the
text
and
structure
points
away
from
a
jurisdictional
reading.
second,
the
deadline
that
applies
to
disabled
and
largely
uncounseled
veterans
seeking
their
first
day
in
court
is
not
the
type
of
deadline
that
congress
would
be
expected
to
rank
as
jurisdictional.
and
third,
a
jurisdictional
reading
would
render
some
of
the
most
disabled
of
veterans
the
least
likely
to
obtain
benefits
and
would
treat
veterans
worse
off
than
almost
all
litigants
in
our
federal
system.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
because
neither
this
court's
decision
in
bowles
nor
any
other
decision
by
this
court
holds
that
this
type
of
an
appeal
from
a
pro-claimant
and
non-adversarial
proceeding
to
a
court
of
first
review
clearly
speaks
in
jurisdictional
terms,
notwithstanding
the
lack
of
a
jurisdictional
label.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
i
can
understand
why
maybe
the
federal
circuit
did
it,
because
of
the
one
statement
that
the
court,
i
think,
took
out
of
context.
but
this
court's
decision
in
bowles
didn't
purport
to
extend
to
any
statute,
no
matter
what
the
statute
said
or
what
the
context
it
arose
in,
and
the
most
closely
analogous
context
of
an
appeal
of
agency
action
to
a
court
of
first
review
is
a
social
security
context.
and
even
if
you
don't
think
that
that
context
is
directly
on
point,
then
the
historical
backdrop
at
most
would
be
inconclusive,
and
that
hardly
would
rise
to
the
type
of--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--that's
right.
i
mean,
it--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right,
and
there
is
nothing
inherently
jurisdictional
about
the
word
"appeal".
and
justice
scalia,
if
congress
that
passed
this
statute
wanted
to
pick
up
on
the
jurisdictional
rule
under
28
2107,
presumably
it
would
have
written
a
statute
that
looks
something
like
that
statute
with
the
safety
valves.
of
course,
when
a
--
all
litigants,
civil
litigants
who
are
appealing
a
district
court
judgment
to
a
court
of
appeals,
they
have
a
jurisdictional
deadline,
but
the
district
court
can
extend
it
for
good
cause
or
excusable
neglect
or
when
the
party
lacks
notice
of
an
adverse
judgment
or,
importantly,
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
here's
a
situation
when
a
litigant
timely
files
his
appeal,
but
does
so
in
the
wrong
form.
in
this
statute
congress
knew
how
to
incorporate
the
jurisdictional
rule
of
bowles.
it
did
so
in
a
separate
provision
of
the
statute
in
7292(a).
it
said
when
a
litigant
wants
to
go
from
the
veterans
court
and
appeal
that
decision
to
the
federal
circuit,
the
litigant
has
to
follow
the
time
and
the
manner
prescribed
for
appealing
district
court
judgments
to
court
of
appeals.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
and
interestingly,
it
also
goes
on
to
say
if
you
want
to
appeal
to
this
court,
you
have
to
apply
for
certiorari.
so
congress--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no.
i
think
what's
important
is
that
bowles
is
relying
on
a
series
of
decisions
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
word
"notice
of
appeal",
of
course,
because
they
were
dealing
with
cases
involving
writs
of
error
and
petitions
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
it
was
all
in
the
context
of
court-to-court
appeals.
bowles
doesn't
even
mention
agency
appeal
of
agency
action
to
a
court
of
first
review.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
the
rule
of
reed
elsevier,
which
was
a
unanimous
decision
which
says
--
and
it
was
written
by
the
same
author
of
bowles
--
that
all
the
decisions
are
consistent.
you
require
a
clear
statement
of
jurisdictional
intent,
and
in
bowles,
this
court
had
read
the
type
of
limitation
that
was
at
issue
in
bowles
as
to
clearly
speak
in
jurisdictional
terms,
notwithstanding
a
label.
here,
you
have--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--you
had
a
century--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--i
don't
think
this
court
said
the
word
"notice".
notice
of
appeal
is
not
jurisdictional
in
the
criminal
context
and
congress
used
the
word
"appeal"
throughout
this
particular
statute
in
a
non-jurisdictional
meaning
in
all
the
proceedings
that
go
in
the
agency.
it
used
the
term
"appellant"
and
"review
on
appeal".
it's
actually
called
the
board
of
veterans
appeal,
substantive
appeal.
none
of
those
words
have
"jurisdictional".
and
if
congress
was
just
thinking
of
the
word
7252(a),
and
that
makes
no
reference
to
the
120-day
deadline.
and
i
think
in
terms
of
the
context,
let's
--
this
is
exactly
the
type
of
deadline
that
congress
would
be
expected
to
be
subject
to
equitable
tolling.
let
me
just
give
you
the
three
reasons--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--yeah.
i
think
i
found
four
that
used
the
term
"notice
of
appeal",
and
it
was
in
connection
with
the
district
court,
and
they
weren't
even
reported
cases.
they
were
very
esoteric
situations,
like
an
order
from
the
department
of
agriculture.
i
mean,
maybe
the
government
has
different.
what
you
mostly
see
is
the
hobbs
act
context,
where
you
are
talking
about
either
an
organic
statute
or
28
u.s.c.
2344,
which
is
just
a
simple
petition
for
review.
that
doesn't
even
use
the
word
"notice
of
appeal".
so
this
case
is
not
going
to
dictate
a
whole
lot,
except
for
the
veterans
context,
where
not
only
do
you
have
the
standard
lack
of
indication
that
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional,
but
you
have
the
unique
features
in
that
congress
established
this
court
to
open
the
door
to
veterans
seeking
disability
benefits,
and
it
would
just
conflict
with
that
purpose
to,
at
the
same
time,
shut
the
door
when
the
veteran's
disability
prevents
him
from
getting
to
the
courthouse.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes,
but
that
points
out
the
irony:
he's
in
better
off
shape
if
he
appeals
to
the
court
of
appeals,
because
there,
there's
--
at
least
there's
important
exceptions.
the
government's
position
assumes
that
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
were
--
and
remember,
a
lot
of
these
cases,
the
veteran
is
actually
timely
filing
his
appeal;
he
mistakenly
files
in
the
veterans
administration
rather
than
the
veterans
court
--
and
the
government
assumes
that
these
uncounseled
veterans
are
simply
out
of
time
and
out
of
luck
with
no
exception.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
it
says
you
have
to
follow
the
exact
time
and
procedure
that
is
set
forth
in
the
process
for
appealing
a
united
states
district
court
decision
to
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals,
so
it
is
the
procedures
under
28
u.s.c.
2107.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
sure.
i
mean,
the
statute
of
limitations
in
zipes,
which
is
180
days
to
file
a
charge
with
the
eeoc.
but
in
the
veterans
context--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--yes,
the
veteran's
context.
this
is
a
blink
of
an
eye
in
the
veteran's
context.
the
veteran
is
given
an
entire
year
--
not
120
days,
a
year
--
after
an
initial
decision
comes
down
from
a
regional
office
to
decide
whether
to
appeal
to
the
boards
of
veterans'
appeals.
and
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
the
type
of
extra
time
we
are
talking
about.
an
extra
30
to
60
days
would
be
an
extremely
poor
and
unlikely
means
for
congress
to
address
the
type
of
situation
where
equitable
tolling
might
be
needed,
which
is
either
because
the
secretary
has
held
onto
the
notice
of
appeal
until
after
the
120
days
and
then
tells
the
veteran,
or
the
veteran
has
some
devastating
mental
illness
and
has
difficulty
with
processing
deadlines
and
dealing
with
concepts.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes,
and
it
says--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--well,
it
is
a
--
you
can
look
it
up--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--not
only
has
the
federal
circuit
ruled
en
banc
that
it
does,
but
this
court's
decision
in
irwin
and
in
united
states
v.
young
specifically
recognized
that
a
classic
equitable
tolling
situation
is
when
there
is
no
prejudice
to
the
other
side
and
the
litigant
files
in
the
wrong
forum.
and
you
have
to
keep
in
mind,
there
is
a
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
on
point.
rule
4(d)
says
when
a
litigant
mistakenly
files
his
notice
of
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
presumed
to
be
correctly
filed
in
the
district
court.
and
whatever
you
think
about
what
your
--
what
an
average-type
person
might
see
when
they
see
a
two
page
single-spaced
form
with
a
lot
of
legalese,
this
form
is
difficult
for
a
lawyer
to
read,
and
to
expect
--
the
vast
majority
of
the
claimants
reading
this
form
are
uncounseled
and
i
urge
you
to
read
the
form.
it
doesn't
just
say:
you
have
120
days
to
appeal.
it
goes
on
and
on
and
on
telling--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--it's
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
it's
got
the
va
form,
and
i
had
to
look
it
up
just
by
punching
it
in
on
the
internet.
but
whatever
you
think
about
the
clarity
of
someone
--
of
your
statute
that
might
be
able
to
understand
it,
time
and
time
again,
veterans
file
in
the
wrong
forum.
and
it's
not
always
just
the
veterans'
fault.
sometimes
the
secretary
is
giving
the
veteran
misleading
advice.
we
cite
cases
in
our
brief,
and
so
do
the
amici,
where
the
veterans'
administration
is
giving
the
veteran
just
misleading
advice.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
it's
purely
appellate,
and
district
courts
always
say
when
they
get
these
things:
this
is
an
appeal
of
the
social
security
decision.
but
i
think
the
three
reasons
that
i'm
trying
to
get
on
why
this
is
precisely
the
type
of
deadline
that
congress
would
not
rank
as
jurisdictional
and
would
want
to
be
subject
to
equitable
tolling
are
the
--
pretty
much
the
reasons
that
apply
even
more
so
in
the
veterans'
context.
and
that
is
the
first:
this
is
an
extremely
favored
class
of
litigants.
these
are
veterans
who
have
fought
for
their
country
and
who
are
seeking
service-connected
disability
benefits.
this
is
also
the
veterans'
first
opportunity
to
get
to
a
court,
which
is
true
in
the
social
security
system.
and
importantly,
the
vast
majority
of
veterans
go
to
the
court
without
counsel.
the
numbers
are
over
50
to
70
percent.
and
that
was
true
in
the
social
security
system.
i
don't
think
that--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--that's
right.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
i
mean,
up
until
2006
they
were
actually
barred
from
having
lawyers.
but
this
is
the
same
thing
as
the
social
security
context,
which
is
what
this
court
relied
on
unanimously
in
bowen,
in
holding
that
it
is
not
jurisdictional,
and
it
is
also
what
this
court
relied
on
in
zipes,
is
that
you
wouldn't
expect
congress
to
enact
an
inflexible,
harsh,
no
exceptions
whatsoever
jurisdictional
deadline
when
congress
presumably
knew
that
the
vast
majority
of
people
who
would
be
navigating
this
system,
coming
out
of
this
extremely
informal
adversarial
system
where
the
secretary
had
a
duty
to
actually
assist
the
veteran
and
then
hitting
what
is
then
an
adversarial
system,
and
you
would
think
that
you
would
want
equitable
tolling.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes,
in
the
veterans'
administration,
not
in
veterans'
court.
so
50
to
70
percent.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
that's
correct,
but
i
wouldn't
say
they
drop
them
like
a
hot
potato.
these
are
people
who
are
sitting
in
the
va
and
they
--
remember,
like
in
this
case,
it's
three
years
later
--
they
don't
even
get
notice
of
the
final
decision,
which
is
just
sent
to
the
veteran.
they
don't
have
any
kind
of
lawyer
relationship.
it's
like
someone
at
one
of
the
va
offices
says:
let
me
help
you,
tell
you
what
to
do,
and
then
that's
it.
so
no,
they
don't
practice
in
veterans'
court.
they
don't
say,
you
know,
here's
my
card,
let's
keep
in
touch.
and
it
might
be
three
to
four
years
later
that
a
notice
is
sent
to
the
veteran.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
i
know
that.
the
veterans'
court's
statistics
says
it's
70
percent.
pro
se.
no
lawyer.
and--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--they
are
still
not
lawyers,
but
the
veterans'
assisted
organizations
who
filed
in
this
case
are
telling
you
they
don't
participate
in
veterans'
court.
that's
not
what
they
do.
they
are
set
up
in
the
va
system.
so--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--they
by
and
large
don't
do
that,
and
the
veterans'
organizations
that
filed
an
amicus
brief
say
they
also
make
the
same
mistake.
they
were
not
lawyers
and
they
often
file
the
wrong
forum,
too.
but
again--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--yes.
i
mean,
half
the
cases
that
we
end
up
talking--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--again,
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
they
don't
counsel
veterans
after
they
make
their
final
decision.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
they
wouldn't
get
notice.
it
would
be
--
someone
would
have
to
have
some
sort
of
relationship
and
call
that
person.
but
in
this
case
--
i
mean,
i
can
tell
you
there
was
no
--
the
veteran
just
had
his
wife
and
there
was
no
one
else
involved
in
the
process
other
than
his
doctors.
but--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--well,
he's
out
of
luck,
according
to
the
government.
that's
just
tough.
but
again,
thinking
about
--
and
remember
that
not
only
is
there
a
clear
statement
rule
in
types
of
jurisdictions,
but
we
have
an
equally
strong
canon
that
veterans'
statutes
have
to
be
construed
liberally
in
the--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--just
the
rule
of
reed
elsevier
and
arbaugh,
that
unless
a
statute
clearly
speaks
in
jurisdictional
terms--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--well,
it
doesn't
sense
to
say
in
1988
congress
was
trying
to
map
onto
some
preexisting
structure
that
didn't
exist.
bowles
didn't
exist.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
i
can
see
your
point.
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
arbaugh
intended.
i
think
it
said
that
when
you
have
a
statutory
requirement
and
when
it
doesn't
speak
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
it
should
restrict
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
this
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
court's
power.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
2101(c).
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
and
the
predecessors
called
writ
of
error.
right,
they
were
--
i
mean,
this
couldn't
be
further
from
it.
congress,
when
it
passed
this
statute,
said:
you
have
120
days
to
file
your
appeal,
and
then
in
a
whole
--
didn't
say
anything
about
the
jurisdiction.
and
a
separate
version
said:
here's
the
jurisdiction,
and
we
will
incorporate
some
procedural
requirements,
but
we're
not
even
going
to
mention
the
120-day
deadline.
and
then
it
goes
to
great
pains
to
say:
2107
will
apply
when
you
appeal
from
the
veterans'
court
to
the
federal
circuit,
and
you
will
have
to
apply
for
certiorari.
but
to
think
about
what
the
government's
position
is,
is
that,
notwithstanding
that
criminal
defendants
and
social
security
claimants
do
not
face
jurisdictional
deadlines,
all
the
civil
litigants
in
our
system
who
do
face
jurisdictional
deadlines
can
get
an
extension
for
good
cause,
excusable
neglect
when
they
don't
have
notice
of
an
adverse
judgment,
and
the
situation
is
cured
when
they
actually
timely
file
but
they
mistakenly
file
with
the
wrong
court.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
all
statute
of
limitations
are
not
jurisdictional.
so
there
is
no
question--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--well--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--no,
of
course
not.
like
i
just
said,
i
don't
know
of
any
that
even
come
up,
except
for
--
i
think
i
found
four
that
say
"notice
of
appeal".
all
these
types
of
cases
that
you
see
are
dealing
with
a
petition
for
review
of
agency
action,
a
la
the
hobbs
act
context.
so
what
i'm
asking
you
to
hold
is
that
when
you
have
a
--
this
particular
statute,
which
the
text
and
structure
certainly
say
it's
not
jurisdictional,
it
is
exactly
the
--
it
is
not
the
type
of
deadline
you
would
expect
it,
and
it
would
undermine
all
of
the
purposes
that
congress
set
up
this
court,
which
was
to
ensure
they
have
their
day
in
court,
they
get
the
benefits
they
are
entitled
to,
and
importantly,
to
cure
the
perception
that
veterans
were
be
--
not
being
treated
the
way
all
other
claimants
seeking
federal
benefits
were.
this
would
completely
counter
that
purpose,
to
say:
here's
a
court;
we
have
built
it
for
you,
but
if
you
can't
get
up
the
courthouse
steps,
that's
too
bad.
if
your
very
disability
prevents
you
from
filing
or
you
have
been
abused
by
the
va
--
the
va
bureaucracy,
you
were
out
of
luck
and
out
of
court.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
and
here's
why,
justice
scalia.
the
veteran
has
had
a
day
in
court.
once
he
is
out
of
the
veterans'
court,
he
is
like
every
--
or
she
is
like
every
other
litigant
in
our
federal
system,
which
--
the
deadline
applies
to
the
government;
the
deadline
applies
to
the
party
--
to
any
party.
that's
2107,
which
applies
to
all
civil
litigants
equally.
they
have
had
their
day
in
court,
and
if
it's
in
the
hobbs
act
context,
usually
they
have
had
some
sort
of
adversarial
court-like
proceeding
in
the
administrative
agency.
but
no
decision
--
and
again,
keep
in
mind
there
were
three
decisions
in
the
social
security
context
--
no
decision
has
ever
said:
pro-claimant,
non-adversary
appeal
to
a
court
of
first
review
is
jurisdictional.
so
congress
was
acting
against
that
backdrop.
and--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right.
and
they
did
go
back
and
forth,
so
there
was
a
period
of
6
years
that
they
held
it
was
jurisdictional,
and
then
a
period
of
11
years,
the
last
11
years,
where
it
has
been
non-jurisdictional
and
there
has
been
equitable
tolling.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no.
i
mean,
in
adopting
equitable
tolling
by
the
federal
circuit
for
mental
disabilities
--
that
case
is
barrett
v.
principi
on
page
9
of
our
brief
--
it
goes
through
how
all
the
sister
circuits
have
dealt
with
the
issue
of
mental
disability
in
title
vii,
in
the
social
security
system,
and
--
and
how
you
would
deal
with
that.
but
let's
take
this
case,
because
it's
a
good
example.
the
doctor
said
he
was
--
he's
paranoid
schizophrenic,
so
he
is
having
periods,
and
to
quote
the
doctor
that
was
submitted
to
the
veterans'
court,
he
had
episodes
of
what
was
basically
called
psychomotor
retardation
and
total
inability
to
function,
and
other
times
he
was
just
simply
disorganized,
had
difficulty
with
recall
and
memory.
so
he
wrote
a
handwritten
note
within
15
days
saying:
i
have
been
on
and
off;
and
he
was
obviously
--
he
is
extremely
heavily
medicated.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
just
point
out
on
the
hobbs
act,
the
actual
statute
says
the
jurisdiction
is
invoked
by
filing
a
timely
petition
for
review.
so
there
is
an
express
jurisdictional
hook.
and
i
think
justice
scalia
points
out
an
interesting
fact
on
--
i
think
it's
safe
to
say
in
1988,
congress
wasn't
sitting
down
thinking:
this
is
deadline
jurisdictional;
we're
subject
to
equitable
tolling.
what
we
had
is
a
period
where
veterans
were
not
given
judicial
review.
we
had
world
war
ii
and
the
vietnam
conflict
and
the
korean
conflict,
which
made
it
just
untenable
that
veterans
were
not
being
treated
on
par
with
other
claimants
seeking
disability
benefits.
and
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
points
out,
since
social
security
disability
benefits
get
judicial
review,
how
can
we
not
treat
our
nation's
veterans
the
same?
now--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--sure.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
i
think
you
correctly
understand
that
we
have
a
different
understanding
of
reality.
so
my
understanding
is
that
representation
is
--
like
the
--
mr.
henderson's
wife
at
one
point
tried
to
become
his
authorized
representative.
there
is
no
question
he
had
somebody
helping
him,
a
veteran's
service
organization
process.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
this
can
take
up
to
4
or
5
years
to
get
notice.
my--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--no,
not
that
i
know
of.
but
this
is
not--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right.
i
understand,
and
i
am
just
telling
you
had
that
my
understanding
from
--
not
just
the
amici
briefs,
that
they
do
not
have
anything
to
deal
with
court,
is
that
the
veterans
organizations
don't
have
notice.
they
are
the
ones
that
are
filing
in
this
case
telling
you
this
decision
will
be
disastrous
for
them.
but
even
if
they
do,
they
are
uncounseled.
they
are
not
lawyers.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
i
agree.
but
these
are
--
the
veterans'
services
--
like
in
this
case,
where
he
lives
in
north
carolina,
there's
only,
like,
50
va
regional
offices.
so
his
representative
may
be
100,
200
miles
away,
and
there
is
not
that
kind
of
connection.
but
if
the
case
comes--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--i
understand,
and
i'm
just
--
my
understanding
is
that
they
--
either
they
don't
get
notice,
and
even
if
they
have
notice,
they
have
--
feel
no
obligation,
because
they
are
not
in
a
representative
capacity
at
that
point,
that
they
would
process
his
appeal
or
advise
him.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
and
i--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--and
i
understand
the
government
representing
that
there
is
notice,
and
i
am
telling
you
that
is
not
my
understanding;
that
when
he
said
authorized
representative,
i
don't
think
that
that
meant
veterans
service
organizations.
i
may
be
wrong.
it
sounds
like
we
have
a
different
understanding.
but
if
i
can
get
back
on
to
what
is
really
before
this
court,
is
that
when
there's
no
indication,
all
we
have
is
the
three
words
--
"notice
of
appeal"
--
when
we
know
that
those
three
words
are
non-jurisdictional
in
the
criminal
context.
there
is
nothing
jurisdictional
about
the
words
"notice
of
appeal".
it
accurately
describes
that
an
appeal
is
going
on.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
the
deadline
is
jurisdiction.
and
the
question
is:
was
congress
thinking
about
the
type
of
people
who
appeal
district
courts
to
courts
of
appeals?
yes,
they
were,
but
they
made
separate
provisions
for
that.
or
were
they
thinking
about
the
hobbs
act,
which
deals
with
licensing
of
the
nuclear
power
plants
and
orders
by
the
fcc,
and
has
an
express
statement
in
the
text
that
it
is
jurisdictional?
i
doubt
that
--
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
that
congress
was
not
thinking
about
any
of
those
contexts.
they
were
trying
to
give
veterans
their
day
in
court.
and
this
decision
would
say
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
were,
they
are
deprived.
now
there
was
some
discussion
on
the
120-day
deadline.
i
think
another
thing
that
is
very
safe
to
say
is
that
time
is
not
of
the
essence
in
the
veterans
system.
it
never
has
been.
120
days
is
a
blink
of
an
eye.
it
is
true
that
social
security
are
given
60
days
and
other
appellants
are
given
30.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes,
there
is
no
prejudice.
they
don't
even
--
the
government
doesn't
even
contest
these
because
it
has
to
be
based
on
the
record
before,
and
all
we
are
talking
about
is
an
extra
30
days
or
60
days.
