justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
agree
with
you,
how
should
a
judge
instruct
a
jury
to
determine
whether
a
substance
is
crack?
should
the
judge
use
the
definition
in
the
sentencing
guidelines?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
in
those--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--it
has
to
have
all
three
of
those
characteristics?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i
thought
you
just
said
that
freebase
would
qualify,
and
freebase
would
not
have
the
second
of
those
characteristics;
isn't
that
right?
it
was
--
it
would
not
be
prepared
using
a
base?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
it
had
any
base?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
other
than
crack
and
free
base,
are
there
other
forms
of
cocaine
base
that
are
actually
in
use
in
any
substantial
amounts
in
this
country
by
drug
users?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
there
actually
people
in
the
united
states
who
are
smoking
coca,
coca
paste?
i
thought
that
that
was
exclusive
to
south
america.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
aware
of
cases
where
that's
happened?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
to
go
back
to
your
definition
of
crack,
just
so
i'm
clear
on
it,
if
a
substance
--
in
the
second
prong
of
your
definition,
if
a
substance
is
tested
and
chemically
it
is
pure
[c17h21no4,]
no
trace
of
sodium
bicarbonate,
no
trace
of
ammonium,
is
it
possible
for
a
defendant
to
be
convicted
and
given
the
crack
penalty?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
right.
and
i
don't
think
--
could
you
just
reiterate
what
the
second
prong
of
your
test
is
because
i
thought
--
i
was
under
the
impression
it
required
the
presence
of
a
reactant.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you
need
extrinsic
evidence
about
how
this
particular
substance
was
prepared
in
order
to
satisfy
it?
if
you
don't
have
the
trace
elements
of
the
reactant,
you
need
evidence
that
that's
how
this
was
made?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
it's
pulverized?
i
don't
know
whether
that's
possible,
but
could
you
grind
it
up
so
that
it's
not
rock-like
anymore,
so
it's
like
a
powder--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
smoke
it
after
it's
in
that
form?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
you
could
have
--
in
romanette
(iii),
they
could
have
said
50
grams
or
more
of
a
mixture
or
substance
which
contains
cocaine
base,
period.
there
was
no
need
to
have
it
described
in
clause
2
if
there's
nothing
implied
in
romanette
(ii)
that
is
not
also
in
romanette
(iii)
with
respect
to
cocaine.
on
your
submission,
it's
just
bad
draftsmanship?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
optical
and
geometric
isomers
of
cocaine?
those
--
those
fall
under
romanette
(ii),
roman
(ii),
but
not
under
(iii).
are
there
such
things?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
my
understanding
of
how
coke
--
how
the
paste
is
produced
is
the
following:
you
start
with
the
leaves;
then
people
vigorously
macerate
the
leaves
by
stomping
on
them
for
an
hour
or
more;
and
then
this
mixture
is
--
this
--
what's
left
is
mixed
with
an
alkaline
material
such
as
sodium
bicarbonate,
an
organic
solvent,
such
as
kerosene,
and
water;
and
what
you
end
up
with
is
a
gummy,
yellowish
solid
called
coca
paste;
is
that
--
that's
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
now,
if
a
chemist
analyzed
that
or
then
analyzed
crack
or
freebase,
wouldn't
there
be
present
in
the
coca
paste
lots
of
other
substances
that
would
not
be
present,
in
quantities?
other
substances
would
be
present
in
quantities
in
the
coca
paste
that
would
not
be
present
in
the
crack
or
the
freebase?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
a
dea
chemist
could
test
--
could
test
a
substance
and
say
this
is
coca
paste
of
the
type
that
is
smoked
in
south
america
by
some
people.
this
is
crack
or
freebase
that
has
been
mixed
with
water
into
a
pasty
substance
--
a
chemist
could
make
that
--
that
differentiation,
couldn't
they?
