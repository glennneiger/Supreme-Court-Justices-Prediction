mr.
pincus,
if
--
if
i
understand
your
interpretation
correctly,
it
would
exclude
freebase.
how
is
that
a
sensible
interpretation
of
the
statute,
one
that
would
exclude
freebase,
a
commonly
known
substance?
congress
was
aware
of
it.
the
richard
pryor
incident
had
occurred.
everybody
knew
it
was
dangerous.
wasn't
it
at
least
true
that
congress
meant
to
incorporate
that
substance
as
well?
justice
elena
kagan
that
means
prepared
from
the
powder,
in
theory--
justice
elena
kagan
--is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
would
it
be
enough
for
you
if
it
had
the
right
chemical
definition
and
it
was
a
rock-like
substance,
just
those
two
things?
would
that
be
enough?
if
the
government
could
show
it
has
the
right
chemical
definition,
it's
rock-like,
it's
solid,
does
it
have
to
show
anything
else?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
asking
the
same
kind
of
question
that
justice
alito
is
asking,
whether
the
government
has
to
show
anything
particular
to
demonstrate
that
it
was
prepared
from
powder
cocaine.
justice
elena
kagan
it's
a
bizarre
term,
ms.
saharsky.
it's
--
i
mean,
cocaine
base
means
the
same
exact
same
thing
as
cocaine,
because
cocaine
is
a
base.
it's
like
referring
to
an
apple
by
saying
"apple
fruit"
or
referring
to
a
poodle
by
saying
"poodle
dog".
i
mean,
it's
a
strange
way
to
speak
about
it.
justice
elena
kagan
it's
a
strange
way
to
be
extra
clear,
to
--
to
use
a
different
phrase
that's
meant
to
mean
the
same
thing
as
another
phrase.
to
use
two
different
phrases
that
are
meant
to
mean
the
same
thing
is
not
a
very
good
way
of
being
clear.
justice
elena
kagan
but
they
don't
need
to
do
that,
ms.
saharsky.
suppose
we
just
said
it
needs
the
right
chemical
definition,
and
it's
rock-like,
rock-like,
crystalline,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
so
it's
rock-like.
it's
not
a
paste;
it's
not
a
leaf;
it's
a
rock.
justice
elena
kagan
but
this
is
--
but
this
is,
ms.
saharsky,
just
a
strange
statute,
where
you
are
--
your
definition
creates
all
kinds
of
issues
about
why
it
is
that
congress
used
two
different
phrases
to
mean
the
same
thing,
and
then
how
it
is
that
if
they
did
use
two
different
phrases
to
mean
the
same
thing,
you're
effectively
reading
cocaine
out
of
the
statute
in
romanette
(ii),
right?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
no,
cocaine
is
the
same
as
cocaine
base.
so
it's
like
saying
--
it's
like
saying
apples,
oranges,
and
bananas
cost
one
dollar;
aforesaid
apples
cost
three
dollars.
that's
a
strange
way
to
write
a
statute.
justice
elena
kagan
but
why
would
it
say
apples
cost
one
dollar
in
romanette
(ii)
if
it
was
going
to
say
apples
cost
three
dollars
in
romanette
(iii)?
