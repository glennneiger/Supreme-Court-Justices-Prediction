i
don't
understand
that.
i
can
understand
the
argument
that
--
that
congress
was
--
was
directing
its
statute
at
crack,
and
crack
had
--
had
a
very
definite
meaning,
which
didn't
include
any
substance
that
--
that
is
rock-hard
and
has
been
produced
in
the
manner
you
suggest.
you're
coming
up
--
you're
urging
upon
us
a
definition
that
neither
is
the
definition
of
crack
nor
is
the
chemical
definition
of
cocaine
base.
it's
neither
fish
nor
fowl.
justice
antonin
scalia
crack.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
but
you
don't
argue
that.
that's
not
the
meaning
you
want
us
to
give
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
essential
to
crack.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
call
it
crack
if
it
weren't
made
that
way,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
"cocaine
base"
suggest
what
you
want?
it
has
to
be
--
it
has
to
be
rock
and
it
has
to
be
base
cocaine
produced
in
one
of
the
fashions
you
suggested.
i
don't
know
how
"cocaine
base"
remotely
suggests
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
them
or
just
crack?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pincus,
you've
lost
me.
you've
responded
to
the
chief
justice
when
he
raised
the
problem
that
this
has
to
be
not
just
cocaine
base,
it
has
to
be
a
mixture
containing
cocaine
base,
you
responded
to
him
by
saying:
well,
crack
always
has
some
mixture
in
it;
it's
never
--
it's
never
pure;
and
that's
why
crack
would
be
covered.
but
in
response
to
justice
alito,
who
asked
you
what
if
it's
pure,
if
it's
pure
cocaine
base,
without
any
admixtures,
you
said
that
would
still
be
covered.
i
mean,
both
answers
can't
be
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
practical
matter
what
difference
does
it
make?
is
the
government
going
to
be
prosecuting
anybody
for
possessing
coca
leaves?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
congress
knew
what
this
chemical
debate
was
all
about.
i
--
i
think
it's
very
unlikely.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
that
the
government's
right
and
--
or
that
you're
right.
and
that
it's
--
no,
let's
assume
the
government's
right,
and
it
is
--
no,
you
say
it's
base.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it's
both,
but
it
includes
base.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
let's
assume
you're
right.
so
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
assume
that
your
major
objection
would
not
be
that.
your
major
objection
would
be:
we're
not
supposed
to
be
writing
a
statute,
we're
supposed
to
be
interpreting
one.
and
there
is
no
way
to
--
to
get
that
out
of
these
words,
no
way,
absolutely
no
way.
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
it
not
relatively
common
statutory
drafting
to
include
something
in
an
earlier
section
which
is
also
included
in
a
later
section
that
imposes
a
higher
penalty?
for
example,
as
i
recall
from
my
criminal
--
criminal
law
courses,
states
have
statutes
that
provide
that
the
taking
of
a
human
life,
homicide,
is
--
is
punishable
by
so
much;
and
then
it
says
the
taking
of
a
human
life
with
malice
aforethought
is
punishable
by
more.
now,
does
--
does
the
second
include
the
first?
of
course
it
does.
it
includes
the
first
and
then
something.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
same
thing
here.
it
includes
the
first,
the
cocaine,
but
it
has
to
be
within
a
compound
mixture
of
preparation.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
saharsky,
coming
back
to
romanette
(iii),
you
have
50
grams
or
more
of
a
mixture
or
substance
described
in
clause
2.
doesn't
--
it
really
doesn't
have
to
be
a
mixture.
it
could
be
pure,
couldn't
it?
it
says
"mixture
or
substance",
not
mixture.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
same
with
homicide
and
murder.
every
murder,
every
murder,
is
a
homicide.
