chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-1533,
depierre
v.
united
states.
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
the
provision
refers
to
"a
mixture
or
substance
which
contains
cocaine
base.
"
you
read
cocaine
base
to
be
crack,
so
you
have
to
be
talking
about
a
mixture
or
substance
which
contains
crack.
what
contains
crack?
crack
is
the
problem
they're
getting
at;
yet
the
statute,
as
you
read
it,
has
to
talk
about
a
substance
which
contains
crack,
not
just
crack.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
kind
of
an
odd
way
for
congress
--
it's
an
odd
way
for
congress
to
phrase
the
provision
if
what
they
want
to
get
at
is
crack,
to
say
what
we
want
to
get
at
is
substance
which
contained
crack.
that
suggests
to
me,
when
you
talk
about
substances
that
contain
something,
what
they
contain
is
a
base
that
then
is
used
in
the
substance.
i
think
that's
a
harder,
harder
logic
to
apply
when
you're
talking
about
crack.
they
want
to
stop
the
use
of
crack,
not
so
much
--
it
wouldn't
occur
naturally
that
they're
talking
about
substances
which
contain
crack.
it
would
occur
naturally,
that
language
formulation,
if
you
think
of
cocaine
base
as
broader
than
just
crack.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
kind
of
elided
the
point
there
in
your
verbal
formulation.
it's
easier
to
say
this
is
something
that's
not
just
cocaine.
it's
harder
to
say
this
is
something
which
is
not
just
crack
because
crack
is
a
type
of
cocaine.
you
can
say
it
contains,
as
the
government
says,
cocaine
base.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you're
saying
congress
is
afraid
that
the
sodium
bicarbonate,
we
might
not
be
able
to
get
at
that
if
we
just
say
crack?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
pincus,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
