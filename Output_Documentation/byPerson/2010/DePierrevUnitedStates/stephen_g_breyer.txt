justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
my
understanding
here
that
--
that
the
problem
in
this
case
--
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
is
because
cocaine
can
become
--
can
be
a
salt.
people
sniff
it
often,
i
guess,
if
it's
a
salt.
and
that's
bad.
and
then
there's
a
kind
that's
worse,
that's
freebase
or
crack,
and
that
isn't
a
salt
and
it
isn't
a
poodle
and
it
isn't
an
acid.
it
takes
a
base
form,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
that's
why
they
have
a
higher
punishment.
then
the
odd
problem
is
that
maybe
a
cocaine
leaf,
but
certainly
cocaine
paste,
which
are
more
primitive
forms,
also
have
a
chemical-based
solution,
they
too.
so
they've
written
this
statute
that
sounds
like
--
that
sounds
like
"who's
your
father's
son
who's
not
your
brother?
"
it
takes
a
long
time
to
figure
it
out.
all
right.
so
would
you
have
an
objection
--
and
i
wonder
if
the
other
side
would
have
an
objection
--
if
what
we
said
this
word
(iii)
means
is
that
it
is
cocaine
in
the
chemical
form
of
a
base
after
it
has
been
processed
beyond
the
stage
of
coca
paste?
and
that's
how
we
read
it.
that
would
seem
to
exempt
the
things
they're
most
worried
about,
the
paste
and
the
leaves.
and
i'm
not
going
to
repeat
the
same
stupid
joke,
poodles
and
fruits,
but
you
see
the
point.
is
there
any
objection
from
the
point
of
the
government
to
define
it
in
that
way,
or
the
other
side?
and
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
don't
care
how
it
was
made.
all
we
do
is
test
it.
now,
all
we
have
to
do
is
test
it,
and
then
we
look
to
see
if
it's
a
leaf.
that
isn't
tough,
i
don't
think.
and
then
we
have
to
look
and
see
if
it's
this
yellow
stuff
that
looks
like
paste,
and
i
guess
that
isn't
too
tough,
either.
so
those
are
the
only
things
you
have
to
do.
you
have
to
test
it,
look
and
see
if
it's
a
leaf,
look
and
see
if
it's
a
paste.
now,
even
the
--
i
mean,
i
say
"even".
i
mean,
certainly
the
dea
could
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
certainly
they
could,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
got
that
part.
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
make
it
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
you
define
it
in
your
brief,
and
this
is
very
interesting
to
me
--
you
talk
about
it
being
a
yellow
substance
that
came
directly
from
grinding
up
leaves,
something
like
that.
you
have
the
definition
there.
it's
written.
take
that
definition
that
you
wrote,
and
what
you've
said
that's
very
interesting
to
me
that
i
would
like
to
know,
is
that,
that
substance,
in
some
significant
amount
of
time
is
actually
more
addictive,
more
dangerous
than
the
salt,
which
is
ordinarily
sniffed?
now,
is
that
what
you're
saying,
because
i
received
from
this
material
the
contrary
impression.
i
had
the
impression
that
the
yellow
paste
that
comes
from
the
leaf
directly
is,
if
anything,
less
addictive
and
less
harmful,
if
anything,
than
the
salt
which
you
sniff.
now,
which
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
now
if
i
want
to
find
a
citation
for
the
authority
that
paste,
yellow,
made
out
of
leaves
is
in
fact
more
dangerous
and
congress
could
have
thought
that
than
--
more
dangerous
than
ordinary
salt
sniffed,
i
will
read
what?
because
that
--
that
--
i
did
have
that
wrong
impression.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
you've
referred
to,
in
other
words.
i
--
i
mean,
i
trust
your
brief
implicitly,
but
i
don't
know
on
the
scientific
matter
or
the
congressional.
i
would
like
to
know
what
to
read
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
page
is
that
of
the
brief?
you
don't
have
to
read
it.
i'll
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
i'll
read
that.
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
she
says
there's
no
way
--
and
she
does
cite
this
professor
from
yale
and
so
forth,
who
says
if
the
stuff
has
the
base
in
it,
it
can
be
abused
in
ways
that
if
it
has
the
salt
in
it,
it
can't
be
abused.
that's
all
we
can
look
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
her
point.
you
can
respond
to
that
if
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
she
says
there
is
a
reason.
it's
because
it
contains
base,
and
for
many
years,
it
was
smoked
in
latin
america
and
can
be
smoked
here.
that's
her
reason.
now,
your
response
is,
it's
a
bad
reason?
