--can
you
get

into

without
using

is
there
some
way
that
the
rock
type
form
of
cocaine
could
ever
be
achieved
without
a
use
of

justice

and
coca
paste,
what
can
you
do
with
coca
paste?
can
you
make
it
into
powder
or
is
it
only
useable
as
a
--
ultimately
for
a
rock-like
formation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
cocaine
paste
--
coca
paste
is
smokeable
in
its
paste
form?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
assuming
we
accept
the
--
the
brief
of
the
physicians
and
scientists,
they
say
clearly
that
coca
leaves
can
be
chewed,
but
they
are
bulky
and
contain
a
lot
of
organic
matter
in
addition
to
cocaine.
i
understood
their
scientific
explanation
to
say
that
coca
leaves
contain
coca
--
cocaine.
i
think
you've
taken
the
contrary
position,
but
let's
assume
we
accept
the
sciences
answer.
what
does
that
do
to
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
representing
that
you
will
never
prosecute
someone
who
possesses
coca
leaves
under
subdivision
(iii)?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
you're
representing
to
the
court
that
you
won't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
did
it
draft
it
to
say
"cocaine
salts,
et
cetera",
as
opposed
to
"cocaine,
comma,
its
salts,
et
cetera?
"
if
it
intended
to
differentiate
between
true
cocaine
and
its
byproducts
like
salts,
et
cetera,
why
didn't
it
just
simplify
the
language
in
roman
numeral
number
(ii)?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
why
would
it
do
that?
if
it's
going
to
treat
cocaine
base,
which
is
the
same
thing
as
cocaine,
differently
from
cocaine
salts,
why
doesn't
it
just
say
cocaine
salts?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
couldn't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it
say
"cocaine
and
its
isomers"
or
something?
"its
isomers".
why
is
it
using
(ii)
and
in
--
in
(iv)?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
a
hypothetical
that
the
statute
was
the
same
but
that
things
were
reversed;
that
the
smaller
universe
of
items
was
the
salt
rather
than
the
crack,
and
so
they
put
an
enhancement
in
roman
numeral
number
(iii)
for
salt
rather
than
crack.
is
your
argument
that
it's
redundant
based
on
the
fact
that
a
larger
grouping
of
the
chemicals
listed
in
roman
numeral
number
(ii)
is
excluded
by
roman
numeral
number
(iii),
so
that
--
is
that
the
basis
of
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
the
first
case,
at
the
time
of
petitioner
frantz
depierre's
conviction
in
sentence,
clause
(iii)
of
21
u.s.c.
841
(b)(1)(a),
provided
a
mandatory
ten-year
minimum
sentence
for
certain
drug
offenses
involving
50
grams
or
more
of
a
mixture
or
substance
which
contains
cocaine
base.
depierre,
was
convicted
by
a
jury
of
distributing
50
grams
or
more
of
cocaine
base,
and
he
was
sentence
to
ten
years
in
prison.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
term
"cocaine
base"
in
clause
subdivision
(iii)
refers
to
the
chemically
basic
form
of
cocaine
as
the
government
who
argues,
or
whether
it
refers
strictly
to
crack
cocaine
as
depierre
would
have
it.
cocaine
is
a
chemically
basic
compound
derived
from
the
coca
plant.
the
leaves
of
which
can
be
processed
into
a
smokable
paste-like
substance.
when
this
coca
paste
is
processed
with
hydrochloric
acid,
the
result
is
cocaine
hydrochloride,
the
powder
form
of
cocaine
which
is
most
commonly
snorted.
cocaine
hydrochloride
is
not
a
base.
it
is
a
salt
with
a
different
molecular
formula
than
chemically
basic
cocaine.
however,
it
can
be
converted
into
chemically
basic
cocaine
by
processing
it
with
a
base
like
baking
soda,
producing
crack
cocaine
which
is
smoked.
cocaine
hydrochloride
can
also
be
processed
with
ammonia
to
produce
a
less
common
smokable
drug
known
as
"freebase".
coca
paste,
crack
cocaine,
and
freebase,
all
contain
cocaine
in
its
basic
form.
we
agree
with
the
government
that
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
term
"cocaine
base"
is
chemically
basic
cocaine.
in
arguing
that
the
term
should
be
read
instead
to
mean
only
crack
cocaine,
depierre
asked
so
as
to
stray
far
from
the
statute's
text,
as
the
term
"crack
cocaine"
appears
nowhere
in
the
statute.
although
the
term
"cocaine
base"
is
somewhat
redundant,
from
a
chemical
prospective,
cocaine
is
a
base.
we
think
congress
had
good
reason
to
use
cocaine
in
clause
(iii),
namely
to
distinguish
the
substances
covered
by
that
clause
from
the
cocaine
related
substances
enumerated
in
another
clause
in
the
statute,
which
provides
lower
penalties.
at
the
time
congress
enacted
the
statute,
the
word
"cocaine"
was
commonly
used
to
refer
simply
to
cocaine
hydrochloride
that
is
powder
cocaine.
and
in
the
scientific
and
medical
literature,
if
it
wasn't
confusing
enough,
the
word
"cocaine"
is
often
used
to
refer
to
all
cocaine
related
substances
including
powder
cocaine.
thus,
the
term
"cocaine
base"
serves
to
delineate
the
precise
set
of
substances
subject
to
the
higher
penalties.
as
we
explain
in
our
opinion,
we
are
also
not
convinced
by
depierre's
additional
arguments.
we
do
not
agree
that
reading
cocaine
base
in
clause
(iii)
to
mean
chemically
basic
cocaine,
renders
superfluous,
the
word
"cocaine"
used
elsewhere
in
the
statute,
nor
does
our
interpretation
produce
an
absurd
result.
we
are
also
not
persuaded
by
depierre's
suggestion
that
when
congress
enacted
this
provision,
it
was
all
--
it
was
solely
concerned
with
the
special
dangers
produced
by
crack
cocaine.
and
finally,
the
fact
that
the
united
states
sentencing
commission
has
defined
cocaine
as
used
in
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
to
mean
"crack
cocaine,"
does
not
mean
that
the
statute
in
this
case
must
be
interpreted
in
the
same
way.
in
some,
we
hold
that
the
term
"cocaine
base"
as
used
in
841
(b)
(1),
means
chemically
basic
cocaine.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
is
affirmed.
