justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mentioned
leaves
several
times,
and
you
talked
about
that
in
your
--
in
your
brief.
if
this
were
a
trial
court
and
we
had
two
world-class
chemists,
strictly
from
a
chemical
standpoint
wouldn't
they
tell
you
that
the
cocaine
in
a
leaf
is
in
a
salt
form,
not
a
base
form?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
depend
on
the
age
of
the
leaf
or
if
it's
been
in
the
sun
or
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no,
no,
no,
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
that
the
chemists
said
that
it's
always
a
salt.
and
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought
that
was
the
government's
position,
that
it's
a
salt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
ended
by
saying
oh,
sometimes
it's
a
salt.
