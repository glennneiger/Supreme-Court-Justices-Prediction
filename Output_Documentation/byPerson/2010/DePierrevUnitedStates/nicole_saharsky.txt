ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
whether
you
call
it
freebase,
coca
paste
or
crack,
it's
the
same
thing
chemically.
it
is
cocaine
base,
it
is
smokeable,
it
has
the
same
effects
on
the
user;
and
congress
did
not
limit
the
statute
to
one
form
of
cocaine
base.
this
court
shouldn't
do
it,
either.
just
to
pick
up
on
some
of
the--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes,
it
is
smokeable
in
its
paste
form,
and
that
evidence
was
before
congress.
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
of
course
we
don't
think
that
that's
right
as
a
scientific
matter.
but
probably
more
importantly,
that's
not
something
that
we
can
prove.
we
have
the
world's
experts
working
for
the
dea
on
cocaine-related
substances.
we
don't
have
one
of
them
who
would
get
up
in
court
and
say
that
coca
leaves
contain
cocaine
in
its
base
form.
we--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
romanette
provision,
romanette
(iii),
which
would
be
the
sentencing
enhancement,
we
have
never
applied
in
any
case
to
coca
leaves.
we
have
never
even
had
a
case
where
it's
been
an
issue.
we've
never
considered
it--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--we
don't
have
a
chemist
who
would
testify
that.
we
would
not
be
able
to
make
that
showing
in
court.
but
perhaps
a
more
important
question
is
whether
there
was
evidence
before
congress
that
the
provision
in
romanette
(iii)
would
apply
to
coca
leaves,
and
there
wasn't.
there
was
evidence
before
congress
about
different
base
forms
of
cocaine,
that
distinguished
between
the
salt
form
and
the
base
form,
and
it
mentioned
substances
like
coca
paste,
it
mentioned
substances
like
freebase,
and
it
mentioned
crack.
and
the
important
thing
in
--
in
looking
at
the
term
that
--
that
congress
eventually
used,
cocaine
base,
is
that
that
came
from
science.
petitioner
says,
well,
you
know,
"base"
was
a
colloquial
term.
the
reason
that
"base"
was
used
is
because
cocaine
is
in
its
base
form.
that
is
what
makes
it
smokeable.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
it
is
an
extra
clear,
extra
precise
way
to
think
--
to
speak
about
it,
and
we
think
that
there's
a
good
reason
that
congress
did
that.
in
the
preceding
provision
in
romanette
(ii),
congress
was
defining
the
whole
world
of
cocaine-related
substances.
so
when
it
used
"cocaine"
there
--
and
it
does
mean
cocaine
base
there
--
but
cocaine,
its
salt,
its
optical
and
geometric
isomers,
it's
talking
about
everything.
it
didn't
need
to
distinguish
between
the
different
forms.
and
that
formulation
had
already
existed
like
that
in
the
controlled
substances
act.
but
then
in
1986
congress
was
hearing
testimony
about
a
specific
form,
the
base
form
of
cocaine.
did
you,
at
that
point
--
would
one
want
congress
to
have
just
said
(iii)?
no,
congress
said
"cocaine
base"
because
it
wanted
to
be
extra
clear.
there's
another
reason
--
another--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
it's
really
just
adding
the
extra
word
"base".
it's
not
like
they're
two
completely
different
words.
it's
just
the
addition
of
"base"
to
be
extra
clear.
another
way
to
think
about
it
is
this:
in
1986,
prior
to
1986,
this
court
had
decided
cases
in
which
it
had
said,
somewhat
imprecisely,
that
cocaine
hydrochloride
was
cocaine.
it
called
it
"cocaine"
throughout
its
opinion.
it
didn't
make
a
scientific
finding,
but
that's
how
the
court
referred
to
cocaine
hydrochloride,
"cocaine".
this
was
in
its
1970
decision
in
turner.
it
was
in
its
1985
decision
in
montoya
de
hernandez.
congress
is
presumed
to
know
about
this
court's
decisions.
it
knew
perhaps
that
courts
had
used
the
term
"cocaine"
imprecisely,
despite
the
fact
that
it
has
a
specific
scientific
meaning.
congress
was
going
to
be
extra
clear
and
use
the
term
cocaine
base.
another--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes,
i
think
that
it
does
that,
your
honor.
i'm
looking
at
page
19
of
the
government's
brief.
this
is
--
you
know,
throughout
the
briefs,
you
have
romanette
(ii)
and
romanette
(iii).
if
you
look
at
romanette
(ii)
--
again,
i'm
on
page
19
of
the
gray
brief,
but
it's
in
other
briefs,
too
--
romanette
(ii),
roman
(ii):
"cocaine,
its
salts,
optical
and
geometric
isomers.
"
in
roman
(ii),
"cocaine"
does
refer
to
the
base
form;
"its
salts"
refers
to
cocaine
hydrochloride.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
it--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
the
base
form
has
to
be
somewhere
in
romanette
(ii),
because
the
way
that
congress
drafted
these
two
provisions
together
is
that
a
large
amount
of
substances
are
listed
in
romanette
(ii)
and
then
a
subset
is
pulled
out
in
romanette
(iii).
and
romanette
(iii)
says,
you
know,
50
grams
or
more
of
a
mixture
of
substance
described
in
clause
(ii)
which
contains
cocaine
base.
so
you
need
to
have
something
that's
described
in
clause
(ii)
and
that
would
contain
cocaine
base,
and
that
would
be
the
word
(ii).
so
you
couldn't
just
say
"cocaine
salts",
meaning
the
hydrochloride
form,
optical
and
geometric
isomers.
you
need
something
to
get
the
base
form
into
--
into
roman
(ii).
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
that
there
is
a
redundancy,
but
i
think
it
is
understandable
in
light
of
the
fact
the
courts
had
used
the
word
"cocaine"
somewhat
imprecisely.
i
think
it's
also
understandable
in
light
of
the
fact
that
congress
was
putting
an
enhanced
penalty
in
play,
and
that
if
congress
had
not
been
extra
clear
there
would
be
criminal
defendants,
perhaps
like
petitioner,
coming
to
court
and
saying,
if
congress
had
just
said
"cocaine",
that
that
wasn't
clear
enough.
it's
true
that
--
you're
right,
justice
alito,
that
congress
could
have
said:
here's
some
things
in
(ii);
here's
some
things
in
(iii);
they
don't
overlap.
congress
didn't
do
that.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
there
is,
in
roman
(i),
coca
leaves,
except
those
from
which
all
of
the
active
substances
have
been
taken
out.
in
roman
(ii),
the
salts
of
cocaine,
their
optical
and
geometric
isomers
and
salts
of
isomers.
you
have
(iii),
which
is
ecgonine,
which
is
a
smaller
molecule
that
is
part
of
the
cocaine
molecule.
it
was
made
--
it
was
used
in
pharmaceuticals
a
while
back.
it's
not
something
that's
really
seen
in
the
production
process
now.
and
you
would
have
compounds,
mixtures,
or
preparations
that
don't
contain
cocaine
base.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
there
are
optical
--
optical
isomers
are
--
isomers
are
generally
substances
that
have
the
same
chemical
definition,
the
same
--
but
different
spatial
arrangements
of
atoms.
optical
isomers
are
nonsuperimposable
mirror
images,
like
right
and
left-handed
versions
of
the
same
molecule.
those
are
--
those
are
both
cocaine
base.
there
is
a
right-handed
cocaine
base
and
a
left-handed
cocaine
base.
they're
both
cocaine
base.
we
think
that
those
would
be
counted
within
romanette
(iii).
geometric
isomers,
which
are
never
seen,
are
slightly
different.
they
are
based
on
spatial
arrangements
where
a
certain
part
of
the
molecule
is
--
it
is
pushed
out
or
pushed
up
axially
or
equatorially.
they're
--
you
know,
geometric
isomers
are
not
seen.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
would
say
cocaine
hydrochloride
would
be
the
primary
one,
which
would
be
powder
cocaine.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
the
things
that
would
be
under
(iii)
would
be
any
form
of
cocaine
base:
that
would
be
coca
paste,
freebase,
crack,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
just
to
explain,
justice
ginsburg,
why
there
are
so
many
words
here:
you
know,
this
definition
is
taken
from
--
is
the
same
--
the
stuff
in
romanette
(ii),
this
long
definition
--
from
other
places
in
the
controlled
substances
act.
it's
taken
from
schedule
ii,
where
congress
is
defining
the
whole
world
of
cocaine-related
substances
that
are
subject
to
federal
law,
so
that's
--
that's
where
all
of
this
comes
from.
this
was
something
that
existed--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
there's
an
objection
on
behalf
of
the
government,
and
there
are
several
reasons
why
that's
true.
the
first
is
there
often
won't
be
evidence
of
how
the
substance
was
made.
second--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--with
--
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
just
--
i
don't
think
it's
that
easy.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
okay.
first
of
all,
if
you
talk
about
the
chemical
testing
that
can
occur,
dea
chemists
can
tell
you
if
it
contains
cocaine
base
or
if
it
contains
cocaine
hydrochloride.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
they're
not
going
to
start
making
guesses
about
how
it
was
processed.
they're
just
going
to
tell
you
what
they
can--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--fine.
as
soon
as
the
court
starts
saying
not
a
paste
or
rock-like
or
something
like
that,
you
have
some
problems.
the
first
is,
you're
basically
giving
a
national
uniform
roadmap
of
--
to
evasion
on
behalf
of
drug
traffickers.
it
doesn't
--
crack,
for
example,
or
the
rock
form,
doesn't
have
to
be
rock-like.
you
can
grind
it
up
in
a
coffee
grinder
and
make
it
into
a
powder.
it
is
still
smokeable.
it
is
chemically
the
exact
same
thing.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that
is
exactly
how
i
should
have
started,
your
honor.
[laughter]
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no.
i
think
that
that's
based
on
a
misunderstanding
of
how
the
statute
works.
you
need
to
have
(ii)
so
that
when
romanette
(iii)
says
something
contained
in
(ii)
that
contains
cocaine
base,
it
is
pulling
out
a
substance
that
is
in
(ii).
but
it's
--
it's
not
a
redundancy.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that
is
how
congress
wrote
the
statute,
though.
it
defined
a
large
amount
of
substances
and
then
it
pulled
out
one
substance.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
because
these
definitions
in
romanette
(ii)
preexisted
in
other
parts
of
the
controlled
substances
act,
in
the
definitions
section
in
802,
in
the
definitions
of
controlled
substances
in
section
812.
this
subseries
of
definitions,
which
are
the
whole
world
of
cocaine-related
substances,
are
used
several
places.
so
congress
pulled
them
over
and
it
used
them
here
too,
to
define
the
whole
world
of
everything--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--and
then
it
pulled
out
one
thing
for
special
treatment.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes,
you
are
100
percent
correct,
and
i
think
that
the
statutory
language
makes
that
clear
because
it
says
it
has
to
be
a
mixture
of
substances
described
in
clause
(ii).
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
don't
think
that
there
is
evidence
that
paste
is
less
addictive
than
powder.
they
contain
the
exact
same
chemical,
which
is
cocaine
in
its
base
form.
and
the
question
--
they
both
can
be
smoked.
now,
the
question
is
does
one
have
a
higher
percentage
purity
of
the
chemical
than
the
other?
maybe,
but
that
just
depends
on
how
it
was
prepared.
and
there
are
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
several
in
the
cases
that
gave
rise
to
the
circuit
split
in
this
case,
where
the
courts
appear
to
be
grappling
with
whether
something
that
was
a
little
bit
wet
but
still
rock-like
should
be
called
paste.
so--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--it--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
it
is
the
case
that
the
paste,
just
like
the
freebase
and
the
crack,
can
be
smoked,
and
for
that
reason
is
seen
as
more
addictive
than
the
powder.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
you
would
read
our
brief
pages
30
to
33--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
and
in
--
on
these
pages
of
our
brief
we're
citing
evidence
that
was
before
congress
in
the
hearings
in
this
case.
there
were
statements
by
two
different
authorities
who
are
scientists--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--no,
that's
okay.
it's
right
here.
it's
like
29,
30,
31.
there's
a
dr.
beck
who
--
from
yale,
who
testified
specifically
about
the
dangers
of
smoking
coca
paste.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
and
one
i
--
the
point
i
really
wanted
to
make
is
that,
you
know,
once
the
court
says
it
has
to
be
pasty,
or
it
has
to
be
yellow,
you
know,
any
of
those
things
can
be
changed.
the
one
thing
that
can't
be
changed
is
the
chemical
composition.
it's
still
in
the
base
form;
it's
still
deadly;
it
still
can
be
smoked.
the
paste
doesn't
have
to
be
yellow,
just
like
crack
doesn't
have
to
be
white
or
off-white.
there
was
evidence
that
a
few
years
ago
there
were
folks
in
ohio
that
were
coloring
crack
green
for
st.
patrick's
day.
any
of
these
things
can
be
changed.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
rock-like.
it
can
be
ground
up
to
a
powder
and
it
can
be
smoked
that
way.
but
the
important
think
is
that
it's
the
same
thing
chemically.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
controlled
substances
act,
not
just
in
this
provision,
but
holistically,
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
dangerous
chemicals.
this
gets
back
to
the
point
that
the
chief
justice
made,
which
is
the
reference
in
the
provision
at
issue
here
to
a
"mixture
or
substance"
containing
cocaine
base.
the
thing
that
congress
looked
at
was:
do
you
have
a
substance
which
may
not
be
100
percent
pure;
it's
sold
on
the
street;
but
does
it
contain
the
dangerous
chemical?
congress
defines
throughout
the
controlled
substances
act
the
things
that
it
was
concerned
about
in
chemical
terms.
and
that's
just
not
because
it
was
an
easy
way
to
define
things.
it
does
give
greater
accuracy
and
certainty.
but
it's
because
the
harms
that
are
visited
on
people,
the
reason
that
they
are
controlled
substances,
that
they
don't
have
approved
medical
uses,
and
that
they
are
extremely
addictive,
is
because
the
chemical
is
inside
of
them
and
the
chemical
is
dangerous.
so
whether
you
get
the
chemical
out
of
paste,
whether
you
get
it
out
of
rocks,
whether
you
grind
the
rocks
and
make
it
into
a
powder,
whether
you
freebase
it,
it
is
the
same
thing.
and
just
to
--
to
make
sure
the
court
has
you
know,
some
example
or
some
thoughts
as
to
the
issues
that
would
be
caused
if
the
court
started
making
up
definitions
of
crack,
you
know,
a
word
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute
and
does
not
have
any
clear
meaning
--
you
know,
petitioner
says
it
wasn't
clear
in
1986,
the
definition
of
crack
--
i
just
want
to
give
the
court
an
example
of
some
of
the
problems
that
the
--
the
issues
the
courts
of
appeals
have
confronted.
in
several
courts
of
appeals
there
have
been
substances
which
i
think
perhaps
under
justice
breyer's
definition
would
qualify
as
paste.
the
courts
didn't
call
them
paste,
but
in
the
bryant
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
they
said
there
was
a
brown,
soft,
mushy
wet
substance
that
contained
cocaine
base
was
being
brought
in
the
united
states.
the
easter
case
in
the
tenth
circuit:
a
wet
gooey,
cream-colored
substance.
those
courts
are
ones
that
use
the
chemical
definition
of
cocaine
base,
and
they
said,
look,
they
contain
cocaine
base,
they
have
the
deadly
chemicals,
they
count.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes,
that's
true.
but
it
also
can
be
dried.
it
can
--
can
be
dried
and
smoked;
it
has
been
dried
in
south
america,
so
it's
not
always
wet,
it's
just
a
question
of,
you
know,
whether
it
has
had
time
to
dry
or
not.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
they
all
--
any
of
those
would
have
impurities
that
are
not
cocaine
base.
all
three
of
them
would
be
identically
--
chemically
identical
if
that
they
would
all
contain
cocaine
base;
but
you're
right;
the
impurities
would
be
different
because
the
method
of
preparation
is
different.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
it
really
depends,
your
honor.
i
think
if
it's
just
a
--
a
regular
dea
chemist,
they
would
be
able
to
tell
you
what
chemicals
they
can
find
through
standard
techniques
like
infrared
spectroscopy,
like
gas
chromatography,
and
they
can
say
we've
identified
these
chemicals
in
this
substance.
unless
it
is
a
chemist
--
and
we
do
have
some
that
have
additional
knowledge
of
methods
of
preparation,
dea
agents
who
have
that
kind
of
experience,
have
seen
it
prepared
--
those
chemists
--
regular
chemists
would
not
be
testifying
about
how
it
was
prepared.
for
example
in
this
case
the
chemist
testified
that
the
--
the
sample
had
cocaine
base,
it
did
not
have
detectable
amounts
of
sodium
bicarbonate,
and
then
defense
counsel
said
well
is
--
is
this
--
do
you
think
that
it's
--
or
i'm
sorry,
the
chemist,
the
defense
counsel
said
--
wanted
to
--
tried
to
distinguish
it
from
freebase,
and
said
it's
freebase
crack;
and
the
chemist
said
you
know,
i
can't
answer
those
questions.
i
can
tell
you
scientifically
what
it
includes.
and
that
--
that's
really
the
--
the
issue
of
proof,
is
that
you
can
tell
chemically
that
it
has
the
substance
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
at,
the
cocaine
base.
i
suppose
you
can
tell
what
other
impurities
are
there,
but
you
know,
congress
doesn't
care
about
the
impurities,
it
cares
about
the
cocaine
base;
and
that's
why
you
know,
it
says
mixture
of
substance
containing
cocaine
base.
you
know,
one
--
one
other
thing
that
i
just
want
to
make
sure
is
clear
to
the
court,
is
that
there
was
ample
testimony
before
congress
at
the
time
that
it
enacted
this
provision
about
the
chemistry
of
this
all,
that
when
congress
spoke
about
cocaine
base,
it
was
understanding
that
base
meant
chemically
the
base
form,
and
that
again
is
near
the
pages
i
cited
to
justice
breyer
in
our
brief.
but
two
different
scientists,
one
was
the
head
of
the
national
institute
for
drug
abuse;
the
other
was
the
--
was
a
professor
at
yale.
both
with
experience,
and
they
said
things
like
the
form
of
the
drug
is
the
freebase,
the
usual
kind
of
cocaine
is
a
salt.
it
is
cocaine
with
hydrochloride,
it
is
a
salt
like
sodium
chloride.
but
this
has
no
chloride
attached
to
it,
it
is
freebase,
which
is
just
plain
cocaine.
so
congress
knew
the
base
form
of
cocaine
is
what
would
normally
be
called
cocaine.
it
learned
about
the
science
and
it
used
the
term
cocaine
base.
and
i
take
your
point,
justice
kagan,
some
of
the
other
justices:
there
is
perhaps
redundancy
in
saying
cocaine
base
instead
of
just
saying
cocaine,
but
when
congress
in
1986
was
faced
with
a
situation
where
courts,
including
this
court,
had
used
the
term
cocaine
to
refer
imprecisely
to
the
cocaine
hydrochloride
form
and
congress
was
going
to
put
a
mandatory
minimum
penalty
in
place,
congress
had
every
incentive
to
be
extra
clear,
and
that's
exactly
what
we
think
that
congress
was
doing
here.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes,
it
could
be
pure.
i
don't
know
that
we've
seen
any
cases
like
that,
but
it
is
almost
always
cut
with
something
else.
so
just
to
wrap
up
and
be
as
clear
as
possible,
what
congress
had
intended
to
do
in
the
controlled
substances
act
really
was
to
pull
out
chemicals
that
--
that
have
certain
pharmacological
effects
on
people
that
are
dangerous.
congress
did
that
by
using
the
term
"cocaine
base".
that
is
a
term
that
is
expansive
and
includes
all
these
kind
of
forms
that
we've
been
talking
about
today.
the
lower
courts
have
struggled
in
trying
to
figure
out
whether
a
substance
that's
wet,
off-white,
rock-like,
paste-like
counts
as
cocaine
base.
certainly
the
seventh
circuit
has
had
several
cases
like
that.
it
struggled.
if
this
court
picks
just
one
definition
to
limit
the
term
"cocaine
base",
it's
really
setting
up
a
road
to
evasion
for
drug
traffickers
to
change
to
a
different
form.
we
hope
that
this
court
won't
do
that.
we
just
don't
think
the
text
supports
it.
it
says
"cocaine
base"
without
any
limitation.
and
this
--
we
just
don't
think
that
this
--
this
court
should
be
adding
a
limitation
based
on
what
it
thinks
congress
must
have
intended
but
didn't
say
in
the
text.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
