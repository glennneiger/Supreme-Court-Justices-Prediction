mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
dramatically
harsher
mandatory
minimum
penalty
for
what
the
statute
terms
cocaine
base
applies
to
all
offenses
involving
cocaine
or
only
those
involving
substances
with
the
characteristics
of
crack
cocaine.
in
its
brief
in
the
kimbrough
case,
the
government
described
the
provision
at
issue
here
as
reflecting
congress's
determination
that,
and
i'm
quoting,
"crimes
involving
crack
should
be
subject
to
considerably
more
severe
penalties.
"
we
agree.
congress's
targeting
of
a
limited
subset
of
the
substances
qualifying
chemically
as
--
as
cocaine
is
manifest
in
the
statutory
structure,
in
the
language,
for
three
basic
reasons.
and
i'm
going
to
be
looking
at
page
2
of
our
blue
brief,
which
has
the
relevant
statutory
provision.
first,
the
only
way
to
give
different
meaning
to
two
distinct
terms
that
congress
used
in
the
statute
--
"cocaine"
on
the
one
hand
and
"cocaine
base"
on
the
other
--
is
to
make
clear
that
cocaine
base
means
something
different
than
all
substances
with
the
chemical
formula
[c17h21no4.]
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
let
me
answer
--
answer
your
question
with
a
little
bit
of
detail,
justice
kagan,
because
i
think
our
reply
brief
wasn't
as
clear
as
it
might
have
been,
because
the
word
"freebase"
has,
really,
three
different
meanings.
it
means
a
manufacturing
process;
it
means
a
method
of
use
of
a
cocaine-related
substance;
and
it
also
means
a
substance.
so
just
to
be
clear:
freebase,
the
manufacturing
process,
occurs
when
cocaine
hydrochloride,
the
powder
form
of
cocaine,
is
mixed
with
ether
and
ammonia
in
a
very
volatile
mixture
and
boiled.
most
--
many
users
of
freebase
inhale
the
fumes
that
are
released
during
that
manufacturing
process.
that
process
is
very
dangerous,
as
the
richard
pryor
incident
showed,
because
the
substance
is
quite
volatile
and
will
explode.
if
that
process
--
if
the
substance
is
not
used
then,
but
goes
to
the
very
end,
when
all
of
the
liquids
are
boiled
off,
then
it
does
produce
a
rock-like
substance
similar
to
crack
cocaine.
our
submission
is
that
the
--
if
the
substance
is
permitted
to
go
to
the
end,
and
if,
in
effect,
ether
and
ammonia
are
used
as
a
substitute
for
sodium
bicarbonate,
then
the
substance
does
qualify
under
the
statute,
because
it
is
a
rock-like
substance
that
has
--
is
chemically
cocaine,
and
was
produced
in
a
method
similar
to
the
reacting
of
sodium
bicarbonate
with
baking
soda.
but
in
--
when
the
process
is
in
the
middle
of
the
production
process,
we
don't
think
congress
meant
to
reach
that
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
because
that
was
--
is
--
that
substance
is
not
something
that's
easily
marketable.
and
one
of
the
key
things
that
congress
was
concerned
about
was
the
marketability
of
crack
cocaine
in
its
rock-like
form.
that's
what
made
the
really
big
difference.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
think
there
would
be
a
factual
question
in
this
case.
none
of
the
courts
below,
justice
ginsburg,
determined
whether,
in
fact,
this
--
the
substance
at
issue
in
this
case
was
crack
cocaine,
because
the
district
court
ruled
that
that
wasn't
necessary,
that
all
chemical
--
as
long
as
the
substance
chemically
qualified
as
cocaine,
it
satisfied
the
statutory
requirement,
and
the
first
circuit
agreed.
so
in
this
case,
there--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we're
--
we're
objecting
to
the
--
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
charged
the
jury
and
himself
determined
that
in
order
for
this
very
severe
100-to-1
penalty
to
apply,
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
substance
to
qualify
as
crack
cocaine.
all
it
had
to
do
was
to
be
a
chemical
form
of
cocaine.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
a
judge
could
use
the
definition
in
the
sentencing
guidelines,
your
honor.
let
me
just
say,
as
a
threshold
question,
in
many
cases
this
won't
be
a
jury
question.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
in
those
cases,
we
think
there
are
three
--
there
are
three
elements.
one
is
the
substance
has
to
qualify
chemically
as
cocaine.
the
second
is
it
was
prepared
by
processing
cocaine
hydrochloride
with
sodium
bicarbonate
or
with
a
different
reactant
that
produces
a
similar
chemical
effect.
and
third,
that
it's
a
rock-like
or
otherwise
solid,
that
is
smokeable,
that
is
able
to
produce
the
inhalable
vapors.
we
think
those
are
the
key--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--all
three
of
those
characteristics.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
would,
because
ammonia
is
one
of
the
--
is
one
of
--
it's
ammonia
and
ether
that
have
--
that
are
used
to
prepare
freebase.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
any
base.
we
are
--
the
lower
courts,
in
applying
the
sentencing
guidelines
definition,
have
said
that
sodium
bicarbonate
is
not
required.
we
think
it
is
not
required.
they've
recognized
other
substances,
and
we
think
as
long
as
the
process
is
similar,
that
that's
what
the
sentencing
guidelines
capture,
that's
what
the
statute
captures.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
respectfully,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
congress
was
focused
on
crack.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
because
it
--
because
it
was
a
substance
that
had
particular
characteristics.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
we
do
--
we
do
want
the
meaning
to
be
a
substance
with
those
particular
characteristics.
i
think
the
only
question
that
we're
--
that
we're
debating
is
whether
baking
--
the
use
of
baking
soda
is
essential,
because
all
of
those
other
--
those
other
three
characteristics
are
characteristics
of
crack.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
think
in
1986,
the
definitions
were
not
that
clear.
and
i
think
the
sentencing
commission
has
said,
and
certainly
the
lower
courts
have
said,
both
in
applying
the
limited
definition
of
the
statute
for
which
we
contend
and
also
in
interpreting
the
sentencing
guidelines,
that
the
use
of
a
different
base
gets
at
what
congress
--
is
still
a
category
of
substance
that
congress
--
congress
cared
about.
obviously,
if
the
court
would
like
to
construe
the
statute
more
narrowly
and
say
baking
soda
is
required,
we
wouldn't
object
to
that.
but
we
think
that
congress
--
one
of
the
reasons
that
congress
used
the
term
"cocaine
base"
was
that
it
was
trying
to
capture
a
category
of
substances
that
had
particular
characteristics
and
wasn't
focused
so
much
on
the
exact
chemical
formula
that
went
into
it,
because
congress
knew,
in
the
drug
area,
it
would--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
think
in
--
in
three
ways,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
because
congress
didn't
use
the
term
"cocaine",
which
is
used
elsewhere
in
the
provision,
it
clearly
meant
a
subset.
it
didn't
mean
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
substances
with
the
chemical
formula
that
satisfies
the
chemical
term
"cocaine".
second
of
all,
the
statute
shows
just
by
the
100-to-1
ratio
that
congress
was
focused
on
something
that
was
especially
dangerous,
much
more
dangerous
than
powder.
third,
the
legislative
context
was,
as
the
court
said
in
kimbrough,
that
this
was
a
statute
that
was
enacted
in
response
to
a
particular
problem,
and
i
think
the
question
we're
debating
is:
would
congress
have
said,
when
it
defined
the
term
--
when
it
defined
the
term
"cocaine
base"
--
and
i
should
say,
"base"
was
one
of
the
street
terms,
colloquial
terms,
that
was
used
at
the
time
to
--
to
describe
these
categories
of
substances.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
was
--
"freebase"
was
a
word.
"base"
was
a
word.
"crack"
was
a
word.
the
--
the
legislative
debate
didn't
distinguish
necessarily
the
chemical
--
the
chemical
process
for
creating
the
substance.
what
it
focused
on
was
a
substance
that
had
characteristics
that
had
led
to
the
epidemic
that
congress
was
concerned
with,
and
those
characteristics
were
easy
marketability,
because
it
was
a
solid,
incredibly
strong
addictive
potential,
and
inhalability.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
and
we
think
the
reason
that
congress
used
that
phrase
was
often
in
this
reactive
process
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
rock
will
not
be
pure
cocaine
in
a
rock
form.
there
may
be
some
cocaine
hydrochloride
that
didn't
react
with
the
base.
there
may
be
--
then
there
often
is
some
of
the
base
reacting--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--respectfully,
i
disagree,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
provision
just
above
large
roman
numeral
iv
talks
about
compounds
and
mixtures,
and
congress
is
sensitive
in
crafting
the
drug
laws
that
often,
because
these
substances
are
not
prepared
in
a
chemistry
lab,
there
are
many,
many
impurities
associated
with
them.
for
example,
even
cocaine
hydrochloride,
cocaine
powder,
is
not
pure
cocaine
hydrochloride.
it's
often
diluted,
it's
often
cut
with
other
impurities.
and
so
in
all
--
throughout
the
drug
laws
congress
has
used
that
and
we
think
that's
exactly
why
it
used
a
similar
phrase
here,
because
the
crack
rock
does
not
contain
100
percent
chemical
cocaine
in
a
rock-like
form.
there
will
be
cocaine
powder
often,
cocaine
hydrochloride
left.
there
will
be
baking
soda
left
or
the
other
reactant,
and
so
it
will
be
a
mass
of
substances,
and
congress
needed
that
language
to
avoid
defendants
saying:
this
substance
is
not
100
percent
cocaine
in
a
crack
form
and
therefore
i
don't
qualify
under
(iii).
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
may
be
missing
your
point,
your
honor,
but
i
think
even
cocaine
in
a
crack
form
has
other
--
the
rock
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
has
other
things
in
it.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
that
the
defendant,
that
the
defendant
would
say
this
--
if
it
doesn't,
if
it
didn't
say
a
mixture
which
contains,
if
it
said
cocaine
base,
then
the
argument
might
well
be,
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
distill
the
substance
to
find
out
how
much
cocaine
base
is
actually
in
it,
as
opposed
to
how
much
of
it
actually
is
cocaine
in
a
rock
form,
as
opposed
to
other
things
have
been
mixed
in,
instead
of,
as
this
court
decided
in
chapman,
it's
the
whole
package
that
one
weighs.
and
so
i
think
congress
was
getting
at
the
idea
that
it
didn't
want
people
to
either
avoid
the
falling
within
clause
(iii)
entirely
or
trying
to
escape
the
50-gram
crack
threshold
by
saying
there
are
other
things
in
here
that
you
have
to
take
out
before
you,
before
you
can
impose
this
penalty
on
me.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
think
we
don't
know,
your
honor.
there
are
--
certainly
cocaine
leaves
can
be
in
the
country,
and
under
the
government's
definition
of
the
statute
cocaine
leaves
would
qualify
under
clause
(iii).
cocoa
paste
--
coca
paste
can
be
imported
into
the
country.
there
are
cases
like
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
they
may
not
be
smoking
it,
your
honor,
but
they
may
be
bringing
it
into
the
country
in
that
form
and
then
converting
it
into--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--there
are
--
the
case
that
we
point
to
regarding
the
cocaine
that
was
intermingled
in
luggage
and
in
the
fiberglass
of
a
flowerpot
are
both
cases
where
it
was
not
cocaine
hydrochloride,
it
was
cocaine.
so
it
was
either
coca
paste
or
some
later,
more
distilled
form
of
chemical
cocaine
as
opposed
to
cocaine
hydrochloride,
but
it
was
not
in
a
rock
form,
and
i
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
there
are
cases
applying
the
sentencing
guideline
test,
which
is
a
similar
test,
in
which
the
courts
have
said
the
absence
--
i
think
what
you're
getting
at
is
if
the
reactant
is
not
present?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
is
that
it
was
prepared
by
processing
sodium
hydrochloride
with
a
base
or
with
baking
soda
or
similar
reactant.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
prepared
from--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--cocaine
powder,
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
the
courts
have
not
required
--
the
courts
applying
the
sentencing
guidelines
have
said
that
a
chemist
can
testify
based
on
his
knowledge,
and
they've
found
the
sentencing
guidelines
satisfied,
that
in
his
professional
opinion
that's
how
this
substance
was
prepared.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
that
the
element
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
which
we're
picking
up
in
our
second
element,
your
honor,
is
useful
in
making
clear
that
this
is
a
substance
that
was
--
went
from
cocaine
hydrochloride
back
to
cocaine
base,
because
i
think
that's
one
of
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
that
the
government
doesn't
have
to
produce
--
doesn't
have
to
make
a
physical
showing.
it
can
--
it
is
enough
for
the
government's
chemist
--
and
there's
always
a
chemist
that
testifies
in
these
cases
--
to
say
in
his
opinion
that's
true.
i
think
--
i
think
as
a
fallback
we
would
certainly
be
happy
with
the
definition
that
just
had
the
first
and
the
third
ingredients
in
what
i've
said,
but
i
think
the
second
is
important
because
one
of
the
things
that
congress
was
focused
on
was
the
potency
of
the
crack
and
crack-like
substance.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
may
have
misspoken
in
my
response
to
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia.
i
thought
the
chief
justice's
question
was
that
the
formulation
of
a
mixture
or
substance
which
contains--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--somehow
meant
that
congress
was
getting
at
the
chemical,
all
chemical
forms
of
cocaine
because
--
because
that
formulation
was
more
sympathetic
than
thinking
that
it
required
a
rock-like
substance.
and
in
responding
to
the
chief
justice,
all
i
was
trying
to
say
was
not
that
it
was
always
true,
that
there
are
other
things
present,
but
just
that
it
is
often
is
true
that
there
are
other
things
present
and
that
congress's
use
of
the
word
100
percent
cocaine
in
its
chemical
form
and
therefore
i'm
not
covered
by
clause
(iii).
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
the
question
here
is
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor
--
is
the
converse
of
that
question,
which
is:
but
if
it
is
100
percent
cocaine
in
its
chemical
form
in
a
rock-like
state,
is
that
covered
too,
and
i'm
just
trying
to
say:
yes,
that's
certainly
covered,
too,
but
so
is
the
dirtier
form
of
a
rock
that
has
other
things
mixed
in.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--your
honor,
i
think
our
view
--
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
would
say
rock-like
or
a
solid
that
is
otherwise
smokeable,
to
deal
with
people
saying:
oh,
if
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
rock
i'll
pulverize
it.
even
if
it's
tiny
little
rocks,
if
it
still
has
the
smokeability
characteristic,
which
is
what
congress
was
focused
on,
we
think
that
that
would
be
--
that
that
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
coca
paste
is
--
is
the
intermediate
step
for
all
downline
products.
coca
leaves
are
mashed
up
in
kerosene
and
other
things
and
they're
--
through
a
process.
they
are
--
the
first
step
is
to
convert
them
into
coca
paste,
which
is
this
sort
of
mushy
brown
substance
with
many,
many
impurities
in
it.
it
then
typically
is
subject
to
subsequent
processing
which
turns
it
into
cocaine
hydrochloride,
colloquially
cocaine
powder.
and
then
the
way
--
the
way
that
crack
is
produced
is
that
cocaine
powder
is
turned
back,
using
the
process
we've
been
talking
about,
into
chemically
cocaine
in
this
rock-like
form.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
--
i
don't
think
they
would,
your
honor.
we
--
we
talk
in
our
--
in
our
brief,
we
cite
a
number
of
studies
that
have
found
that
cocaine
is
present
in
the
leaf
in
both
the
salt
and
the
chemically
basic
form,
and
i
--
i
think
that
the
study
--
we
explain
in
detail
why
the
government
study,
which
is
a
little
--
the
principal
study
they
rely
on
is
about
125
years
old
--
doesn't
capture
the
new
learning--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
i
think
it's
just
--
you
know,
different
leaves
have
different
characteristics.
the
mix
will
be
different.
but
--
but
as
a
--
a
matter
of
the
chemical
composition,
there
will
be
some
cocaine
in
its
chemical
form
and
there
will
be
some
cocaine
salt
in
the
leaves,
and
i
--
i
think
even
more
important,
congress
believed
that.
so--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that
is
the
government's
position,
your
honor.
but
--
but
on
page--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--our
position
is
that
within
the
leaf,
there
is
both
--
there
--
both
forms
coexist
in
--
in
the
natural
state;
that
there
is
both
the
salt
form
and
the
form
that
is
chemically
cocaine,
and
the
studies
that
we
cite
on
pages
9
and
10
and
in
the
footnotes
on
that
page
i
think
were
very
clear.
early
on
the
processes
for
extracting
from
the
leaf
made
it
difficult
to
tell
whether
the
extraction
process
had
made
it
into
a
salt
or
whether
there
was
actual
chemical
cocaine
in
the
leaf.
more
modern
processes
make
clear
that
there
are
both
forms
in
the
leaf.
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--they
say
they're
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
reason
it
makes
a
difference
is
for
the
interpretation
of
what
congress
meant,
because--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we
say
it's
both.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
both
base--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
then
that
would
mean
that
the
--
the
--
under
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
offenses
involving
leaves,
as
long
as
there
were
more
than
50
grams
of
them,
would
fall
within
clause
iii,
and
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
we
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
judge,
because
in
this
case
in
fact
the
chemist
didn't
testify.
the
chemist
did
testify
that
it
was
chemically
--
it
was
cocaine
in
its
chemical
form,
but
the
chemist
did
not
testify:
in
my
experience
this
is
crack,
based
on
looking
at
lots
of
samples.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
testimony
was
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
baking
soda
found,
and
that
there
was
a
--
that
it
was
chemically
basic.
the
testimony
about
whether
it
was
crack
or
not
principally
came
from
the
informant
in
the
case
and
a
little
bit
from
an
agent
who
also
said
that
he
believed
that
cocaine
powder
was
chunky.
and
so
we
believe
we
have
a
fair
argument
on
remand,
when
the
district
judge
looks
at
the
facts,
that
he
will
say
the
government
did
not
meet
its
burden,
even
though
it's
only
a
preponderance.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
district
judge
would
be
the
finder.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
question,
the
2002
sentencing
report
where
--
sentencing
commission
report
on
this
issue,
on
page
110,
recommends
to
congress
that
substances
other
than
crack
should
be
excluded
from
clause
3,
and
i'm
quoting,
"because
they
do
not
present
the
heightened
concerns
associated
with
crack
cocaine.
"
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
your
honor,
i--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
that
is
her
point.
but
i
think
the
question
here
--
all
of
these
substances
are
criminalized,
and
they're
all
going
to
be
penalized.
the
question
is:
what
deserves
the
100-to-1
sanction?
that,
to
us,
means
something
that
congress
was
especially
concerned
about,
and
certainly,
because
the
government
agrees
that
cocaine
hydrochloride
is
only
in
2,
something
that's
worse
than
cocaine
hydrochloride,
which
is
a
pretty
bad
thing.
as
judge
posner
said,
there's
no
reason
to
imagine
that
congress
meant
to
punish
paste
more
than
cocaine
hydrochloride.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
our
response
is
that
it
is
--
it
does
not
have
the
potency
that
crack
had.
it
was
smoked
here
and
didn't
give
rise
to
the
epidemic
that
occurred
once
crack
was
created,
because
that
was
more
potent,
more
marketable,
and
led
to
all
the
evils
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
at.
second
point:
we
would
be
very
happy
to
accept
your
definition.
third
point,
about
the
statutory
language:
i
think
the
critical
question
here,
as
several
members
of
the
court
have
noted,
is
that
(ii),
but
throughout
the
statute
--
means
all
chemical
forms
of
cocaine.
if
that's
what
congress
meant
in
(iii),
there
was
no
reason
to
just
--
not
to
just
say
it.
the
words
"cocaine
base"
could
have
a
chemical
meaning,
but
the
word
"base"
was
also
in
this
debate
as
a
word
that
was
being
used
to
describe
the
specific
evil
that
congress
was
aimed
at.
and
so
we
think,
at
the
worst,
there's
ambiguity
here.
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
by
using
those
different
terms,
congress
meant
something
different,
but
at
worst,
there's
ambiguity
here.
and
an
ambiguity,
under
the
rule
of
lenity,
means
that
the
clause
should
be
construed
narrowly.
and,
justice
scalia,
going
to
your
point
in
your
analogy
to
state
law,
the
problem
here
is
that
everything
that
is
in
clause
2
is
in
clause
3
under
the
government's
interpretation,
because
clause
2,
roman
(ii),
has
the
word
2,
roman
(iv),
says
any
compound
mixture
or
whatever
containing
cocaine.
under
the
government's
theory,
that
provision
will
never,
ever
be
invoked,
because
every
offense
that
uses
cocaine
is
sanctionable
under
3.
and
so
it's
not
the
situation
with--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
but
the
question
here
is
whether
every
homicide
--
whether
every
lesser
form
of
homicide
is
also
capital
murder.
and
what
the
government's
position
means:
every
lesser
form
of
homicide,
everything
that's
in
(ii)
that
sets
up
a
punishment,
is
also
in
(iii),
and
we
think
that's
the
problem
with
their
interpretation.
and
it's
why,
if
it's
unclear,
as
you
said
maybe
it
was,
then
the
rule
of
lenity
should
apply,
and
congress
can
fix
it.
if
congress
meant
to
include
all
of
these
other
substances,
congress
can
easily
fix
the
statute.
but
we
think,
given
the
way
the
statute
looks
right
now,
that's
not
possible.
two
more--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--that
particular
argument
would
still
apply.
our
principal
argument,
if
i
may
answer
the
question,
is
that
in
this
--
in
the
government's
interpretation,
the
word
"cocaine"
and
the
word
"cocaine
base"
--
the
phrase
"cocaine
base"
have
the
same
meaning.
that
evil
wouldn't
be
present,
and
therefore,
our
argument
would
be
harder,
but
it
is
present
here.
