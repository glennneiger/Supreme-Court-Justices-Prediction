mr.
pincus,
if
the
--
the
substance
that
is
involved
in
this
case
was
a
rock-like
substance
and
it
wasn't
a
powder.
so
why
doesn't
it
belong?
it's
a
rock-like
substance.
why
should
it
be
outside
the
category
cocaine
base?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
correct
me
if
am
i
wrong
about
this
--
i
may
have
a
misimpression
--
but
i
thought
you
were
objecting
to
a
charge
to
the
jury
that
charged
cocaine
base
and
didn't
charge
crack.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
just
said
it's
an
academic
issue
because
there's
not
a
market
for
leaves
or
for
paste.
what
congress
was
getting
at
was
crack.
the
judge
used
the
term
cocaine
base.
assume
you
are
right.
what
should
happen?
could
you
go
back
to
the
judge
and
he
would
then
say,
well,
this
is
--
the
chemists
testified
this
is
crack?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
--
it
was
--
the
testimony
was
it
was
a
rock-like
substance.
what
wasn't
said
was
--
what
is
it?
bicarbonate,
sodium
bicarbonate,
was
not
mentioned.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
the
district
judge
would
be
the
finder,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
you
have
no
apprendi
problem?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
in
(ii)
now,
on
your
reading,
your
expansive
definition
of
"cocaine
base"?
what
is
in
romanette
(ii)
other
than
powder?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
all
very
exotic,
but
practically,
what
does
the
government
prosecute
under
romanette
(ii)?
what
substances
other
than--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
that's
--
so
there
seem
to
have
been
a
lot
of
words
here,
but
in
practice,
(ii)
is
powder
and
everything
else
is
under
(iii)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then,
ms.
saharsky,
you
do
get
the
problem
that
justice
breyer
was
trying
to
avoid.
that
is,
on
your
definition
this
paste,
which
is
supposed
to
be
less
addictive,
less
addictive
than
powder,
gets
bracketed
with
crack,
which
is
more
addictive.
