mr.
crawford,
what's
your
standard?
sometimes
you
say
"certain";
sometimes
you
say
"likely";
sometimes
you
say
"plausible".
which
--
which
is
your
standard?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
crawford,
do
you
think
this
is
right,
that
the
statute
says
that
the
person
has
to
prevent
the
communication
to
a
law
enforcement
officer?
the
statute
also
says
that
the
law
enforcement
officer,
in
fact,
has
to
be
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer,
but
because
of
subsection
(g),
the
statute
does
not
require
that
the
person
intend
the
communication
to
be
to
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer,
and
that's
what
we're
struggling
over,
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
and
--
and
in
doing
that
--
i
mean,
i
guess
my
question
to
you
is
the
same
as
my
question
to
the
government,
which
is
where
any
of
these
standards
come
from.
and
i
agree
that
the
statute
does
not
provide
a
lot
of
guidance,
but
how
does
one
pick
between
a
realistic
likelihood
or
a
possibility
or
a
theoretical
possibility
or
any
of
those
things?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
crawford,
what
would
happen
if
you
were
dealing
with
a
federal
offense
that
was
a
distinctly
federal
offense,
that
really
didn't
have
a
state
counterpart,
like
hijacking
an
airplane?
would
that
itself
be
sufficient
to
support
a
prosecution
under
this
statute?
justice
elena
kagan
is
that
actually
similar
to
this
case?
these
guys
were
going
to
rob
a
bank,
which
i
take
it
is
mostly
prosecuted
by
federal
officials.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
where
does
that
reasonable
possibility
standard
come
from,
ms.
harrington?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
harrington,
what
would
be
--
what
would
happen
if
instead
of
officer
horner,
the
custodian
of
the
cemetery
had
come
across
these
people
and
the
exact
same
thing
had
happened,
would
you
then
say
that
there
would
be
--
that
there
would
be
a
prosecution
--
there
could
be
a
prosecution
under
this
statute?
justice
elena
kagan
so
is
that
the
difference,
that
officer
horner
was
on
his
cell
phone?
justice
elena
kagan
so
ms.
harrington,
suppose
officer
horner
had
come
to
the
scene
and
instead
of
seeing
evidence
that
there
was
a
robbery
about
to
occur,
had
seen
evidence
only
of
drug
use.
now
that
might
be
a
federal
offense,
but
typically
it
wouldn't
be
prosecuted
in
--
in
a
federal
court.
would
you
say
then
that
the
statute
is
not
satisfied?
justice
elena
kagan
because?
justice
elena
kagan
oh,
but
that's
4
years
later.
that
was
way
past
the
time
when
this
incident
occurred.
justice
elena
kagan
you're
saying
the
fact
that
they
got
this
information
4
years
later,
shared
it
with
law
enforcement
officers
after
they
knew
that
a
murder
had
occurred
as
a
result
of
an
incident
would
be
the
same
kind
of
inquiry
that
they
would
make
at
that
time?
justice
elena
kagan
before
the
murder?
