justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
wondered.
you
haven't
really
argued
that,
so
maybe
i'm
missing
something,
and
this
question
may
be
better
for
the
other
side,
but
this
statute,
as
you
go
through
it,
has
some
elements.
the
first
are
facts
about
the
world,
killing
people;
the
second
has
to
do
with
intent,
and
then
they
talk
about
all
these
different
things
to
stop
him
from
going
to
a
federal
officer;
the
third
says
no
state
of
mind
need
be
proved
with
respect
to
the
fact
he
works
for
the
feds.
so,
therefore,
it's
not
part
of
intent.
now,
if
it's
a
circumstance
that
is
an
element
of
the
offense
and
it
is
not
part
of
the
intent
of
the
defendant,
then
isn't
it
an
element,
like
all
other
elements,
that
you
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
didn't
argue
it,
so
nobody's
ever
adopted
this,
so
i
feel
i
might
be
barking
up
the
wrong
tree.
now,
i
grant
you,
you're
not
the
leaf
on
the
tree
that's
going
to
give
me
the
answer
i
need,
which
is
why
i'm
wrong,
but
--
but
did
you
--
you've
researched
this
and
haven't
really
argued
this
point.
so,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
you
were
not
the
trial
lawyer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
you
were?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
anyway,
you've
made
a
fine
argument
here,
even
if
you
didn't
make
it--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
where
do
we
get
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
do
have
a
question
i
would
like
to
ask
at
some
point.
are
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
this
is
very
interesting.
i
normally
think
purpose
is
important.
in
this
one
i
don't,
and
suppose
i'm
right,
purpose
has
nothing
to
do
with
this.
the
problem
here
is
with
the
words
"intent"
and
"prevent".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
how
they're
used
in
ordinary
english.
so
let
me
give
you
an
example,
even
odder
than
justice
alito's.
but
i
think
it
illustrates
the
point
--
the
question.
imagine
you
put
your
son
in
his
room,
and
they
say
why
do
you
keep
your
son
in
his
room
doing
his
homework?
because
i
wanted
to
prevent
him
from
going
to
the
movies.
that's
why.
now,
when
you
say
that,
we
would
impute,
correctly,
you
wanted
to
prevent
him
from
going
to
a
hollywood
movie.
you
wanted
to
prevent
him
from
going
to
an
old
movie,
prevent
him
from
going
to
a
new
movie,
but
prevent
him
from
going
to
a
lithuanian
movie?
now,
why
does
that
sound
so
odd?
because
there's
no
realistic
possibility
that
he
would
go
to
a
lithuanian
movie.
okay.
[laughter]
now,
if
that's
the
problem,
if
that's
the
problem,
the
words
that
capture
that
problem,
are
their
words
"realistic
likelihood",
not
the
words
"possibility".
so
if
i
have
to
choose
between
those
two,
and
that
is
the
problem,
why
don't
i
choose
their
solution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
use
realistic
likelihood
and
if
someone
were
to
tell
me
in
my
odd
example
there
is
no
realistic
likelihood
he
would
go
to
a
lithuanian
movie,
that
seems
to
describe
perfectly
whether
i
would
or
would
not
say
in
trying
to
prevent
him
from
going
to
the
movies,
you
try
to
prevent
him
from
going
to
a
lithuanian
movie.
and
your
--
yours
doesn't
--
i
mean
it's
a
--
i
agree
it
may
not
make
that
much
difference,
but
we
have
to
choose
some
form
of
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
wouldn't
have
been
okay,
but
you
don't
normally
say
of
a
person
when
a
thing
is
really
weird,
but
he
wants
it
to
happen
that
doesn't
do
it
for
that
--
it's
so
unlikely.
i
shoot
an
arrow
into
the
air
hoping
it
will
fall
on
my
enemy.
all
right?
it's
not
going
to.
but
if
it
does,
we
say
he
intended
it.
you
see,
that
--
that's
the
kind
of
linguistic
problem
that
i
think
is
present.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
awkwardly
constructed.
it's
trying
to
get
odd
possibilities,
and
if
it
is
trying
to
get
those
odd
possibilities
about
which
we
normally
would
say
he
did
intend
to
prevent
that
from
happening,
then
those
things
we're
trying
to
leave
out
are
those
where
there
is
no
realistic
possibility
that
they
would
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
let's
take
their
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
the
question
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
slightly
regretting
bringing
up
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
agree
basically
on
the
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
where
you
have
--
where
somebody
tries
to
prevent
a
general
thing,
we
normally
say
you
also
prevent
--
tries
to
prevent
those
things
that
are
specific
that
fall
within
the
general
term,
but
not
every
oddball
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
you
want
is
something
that
rules
out
the
oddball
examples.
and
your
words
are
"reasonable
likelihood",
and
you'll
say
if
it's
an
oddball
example,
you
can't
hold
him
guilty
of
that,
if
it
turns
out
that
in
this
case
the
federal
example
is
an
oddball
example.
my
question
really
is
to
you:
if
you
win
on
that,
then
are
you
going
to
go
back
and
argue
there
was
not
one
piece
of
evidence
whatsoever
that
there
was
any
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
feds
would
investigate
your
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
second
case
is
fowler.
and
we
--
we
thought
the
last
term
was
technical
to
try
this
one.
the
federal
witness
tampering
statute
makes
it
a
crime
to
"kill
another
person,
with
intent
to
prevent
the
communication
to
a
law
enforcement
officer
of
the
united
states,
communication
of
information
relating
to
the
possible
commission
of
a
set
--
of
a
federal
offense".
a
separate
provision
adds
that
the
government
need
not
prove
the
defendant's
state
of
mind,
remember
you
had
to
prove
his
intent,
but
you
need
not
prove
his
state
of
mind
with
respect
to
whether
the
officer,
that's
the
person
whom
the
victim
was
prevented
from
communicating
with
because
the
defendant
killed
him.
alright,
so,
he
was
prevented
with
com
--
you
don't
have
to
prove
whether
that
officer
worked
for
the
united
states,
that's
--
you
don't
have
to
prove
that.
but
what,
if
anything,
does
the
government
have
to
show
about
the
likelihood
that
that
victim,
if
he
had
not
been
killed,
if
he
had
decided
to
report
the
crime
would
really
have
communicated
to
a
federal
officer.
that's
the
problem.
here,
roughly
speaking,
the
defendant
killed
the
victim,
who
was
a
local
policeman,
intending
the
--
he
intended
the
--
the
defendant
in
killing
him
to
prevent
that
victim
from
reporting
about
a
bank
robbery
he
was
planning,
the
killer,
to
any
officer.
the
defendant
began
simplifying,
i
think,
he
wasn't
thinking,
"i'm
going
to
stop
him
from
communicating
with
a
federal
policeman."
he
wasn't
thinking,
"i'm
going
to
stop
him
from
communicating
with
a
local
policeman."
he
was
just
thinking,
"i
don't
want
him
to
communicate,
period."
not
with
anyone.
and
he
just
left
it
at
that.
so
now,
what
does
the
government,
in
that
situation,
have
to
do
to
show
that
that
anyone
included
a
federal
officer?
now,
you
could
argue
that
the
government
has
to
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
victim
would've
communicated
with
a
federal
officer.
but
we
think
that
burden
is
too
strict
and
that's
because
the
statute
penalizes
killing
with
a
particular
intent,
namely,
an
intent
to
prevent
a
communication
with
a
federal
officer,
and
you
can
easily
have
an
intent
even
if
there
is
great
doubt
that
the
communication
would
ever
taken
place.
think
of
a
homeowner
who
puts
up
shutters
with
the
intent
of
preventing
hurricane
damage.
now,
he
has
that
intent
even
if
there
is
doubt,
a
lot
of
doubt
about
whether
there
will
really
be
a
hurricane.
on
the
other
hand,
one
might
argue
that
the
government
need
only
show
that
it
is
possible
that
the
victim
would
have
communicated
with
a
federal
police
officer.
but
we
think
that
burden
is
too
lenient.
it
would
expand
the
scope
of
the
federal
witness
tampering
statute
to
include
many
situations
where
state
witness
tampering
is
--
a
state
witness
tampering
is
really
the
issue.
and
that's
because
many
state
crimes
are
also
federal
crimes,
and
communication
with
the
federal
officer
about
a
federal
crime
is
almost
always
possible.
we
do
not
believe
congress
would've
intended
an
expansion
of
the
statute's
scope
of
this
kind.
finally,
one
might
argue
the
government
must
show
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
victim
would've
communicated
with
a
federal
police
officer.
we
find
this
standard
not
too
strict,
not
too
lenient
but
just
right.
and
for
reasons
which
we
set
out
at
greater
length
than
our
opinion,
we
adopt
that
standard.
we
vacate
the
decision
below
and
we
remand
the
case.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
alito
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
