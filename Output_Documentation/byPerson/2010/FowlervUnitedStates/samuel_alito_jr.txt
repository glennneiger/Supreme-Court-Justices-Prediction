justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
statute
speaks
of
the
intent
of
the
defendant.
the
defendant
must
intend
to
prevent
the
communication
of
information
about
a
federal
offense
or
a
possible
federal
offense
to
a
law
enforcement
officer
who
happens
to
be
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer.
so,
it's
all
a
matter
of
intent.
where
do
you
get
this
question
of
whether
it's
possible
or
likely
or
certain
or
whatever
that
the
information
will
eventually
get
to
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer?
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
simply
what
is
in
the
mind
of
the
defendant?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
say
that
is--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
reasonable
likelihood
that
this
person
who
was
killed
--
now,
you
say
"realistic
likelihood".
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
don't
we
pick
the
standard
that
is
set
out
in
the
text
of
the
statute?
let
me
give
you
this
example:
let's
--
let's
hypothesize
a
very
cold,
calculating,
rational
defendant
who
is
planning
a
federal
crime,
let's
say
the
hijacking
of
an
airplane
over
international
waters,
and
this
defendant
finds
out
that
his
mother
has
learned
about
the
plot.
now,
he
says,
well,
you
know,
i
think
there's
a
one-tenth
of
1
percent
chance
that
mom
is
going
to
go
to
the
fbi
and
turn
me
in,
but
in
order
to
prevent
that,
i'm
going
to
kill
her.
i
intend
--
i
kill
her
with
the
--
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
her
from
going
to
the
fbi,
even
though
i
think
very,
very,
very
unlikely
she's
going
to
do
that.
hasn't
that
defendant
violated
this
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
issue
--
the
issue
here
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
so
--
so
--
and
the
question
is
whether
a
reasonable
juror
could
adopt
a
certain
view
of
the
facts.
now,
couldn't
a
reasonable
juror
in
this
situation
take
this
view
of
the
facts?
your
client
killed
officer
horner
simply
because
your
client
didn't
want
to
go
to
jail.
he
didn't
particularly
care
whether
he
was
going
to
be
prosecuted
in
state
court
or
federal
court;
he
just
didn't
want
to
go
to
jail.
so
his
intent
was
to
prevent
the
communication
of
information
about
the
crimes
that
were
being
planned
to
any
law
enforcement
officer
who
could
send
him
to
jail,
and
that
would
include
a
state
officer;
it
also
would
include
a
federal
officer.
and,
therefore,
there's
a
violation
of
the
statute.
now,
what's
wrong
with
that
view
of
the
facts?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
because
if
there
were
--
if
the
only
crimes
that
were
being
planned
were
state
offenses,
then
there
would
be
no
chance
that
--
that
the
conveying
of
that
information
to
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer
would
send
the
person
to
jail.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they're
planning
--
they're
planning
to
hold
up
a
convenience
store.
it's
not
a
federal
offense;
it's
a
state
offense.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so,
the
person
isn't
going
to
go
to
jail
on
a
federal
charge.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
are
you
saying
that
there
is
no
possible
offense
that's
only
a
violation
of
state
law
and
federal
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
similar
to
the
one
that
i
gave
your
--
your
friend.
two
men
are
sitting
on
a
park
bench
planning
the
commission
of
a
federal
crime,
hijacking
of
an
airplane,
and
they
think
they're
by
themselves;
so
they're
talking
about
this,
and
then
after
they've
had
a
discussion
they
turn
around
and
they
see
there's
somebody
standing
very
close
by;
and
so
they
say
we
have
to
kill
this
person
to
prevent
him
from
going
to
the
fbi,
and
so
they
do,
and
they're
prosecuted
under
this
statute.
but
then
at
trial
they
bring
out
evidence
that
the
person
didn't
speak
a
word
of
english,
only
spoke
russian.
so
there
wasn't
any
possibility
whatsoever
that
this
person
was
going
to
report
that
to
the
fbi
or
any
law
enforcement
officer.
violation
of
this
statute
or
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
a
realistic
probability
relates
only
to
the
question
of
whether
it
would
have
been
conveyed
to
a
federal
officer
as
opposed
to
some
other
law
enforcement
officer?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let's
say
the
case
--
that
this
case
arises
--
exactly
this
case
arises
in
two
different
adjacent
jurisdictions.
in
one,
the
local
sheriff
and
the
local
district
attorney
hate
the
feds.
they
never
talk
to
them
unless
they
absolutely
have
to.
and
so
if
officer
horner
had
taken
the
information
that
he
learned
to
the
local
sheriff,
there's
no
chance
whatsoever
that
they
would
have
referred
that
over
to
the
fbi
or
the
u.s.
attorney
for
prosecution
in
federal
court,
so
no
realistic
possibility
there.
in
the
other
jurisdiction,
right
next
door,
the
local
sheriff
and
the
local
da
don't
want
to
be
bothered
with
bank
robbery
trials.
they
send
all
of
those
over
to
the
fbi
and
the
u.s.
attorney,
so
there's
a
very
high
probability
the
information
would
have
gotten
to
the
federal
authorities.
now,
would
this
case
come
out
differently
depending
on
the
jurisdiction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
a
defendant
has
in
mind
a
particular
officer,
then
there's
a
potential
violation
of
the
statute,
but
if
the
defendant
just
kills
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
this
from
going
to
any
federal
--
any
officer
who
might
happen
to
be
a
federal
officer,
then
there's
no
violation
under
this
--
under
this
reading
of
the
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
under
the
interpretation
that's
been
suggested
to
you,
that
would
be
the
distinction?
