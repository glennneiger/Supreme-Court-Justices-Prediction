justice

sotomayor
going
--
going
back
to
justice
alito's
question:
obviously,
the
statute's
not
written
to
say
the
intent
to
preclude
a
witness
from
talking
to
law
enforcement
officials.
if
it
were
that
simple
about
a
federal
crime,
then
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
it
was
likely,
possible.
all
that
we
have
--
know
is
that
the
witness
was
--
that
the
killing
was
intended
to
stop
them
from
talking
to
law
enforcement,
period.
so,
clearly,
(g)
has
to
have
a
meaning
different
than
merely
stopping
from
someone
talking
to
a
law
enforcement
officer,
because
there
has
to
be
some
connection
to
that
officer
being
a
federal
officer.
so,
going
back
to
justice
alito's
question,
how
do
you
define
the
intent?
what
is
the
defendant's
intent?
if
he
doesn't
have
to
know
it's
a
federal
officer,
what
does
he
have
to
intend?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
articulate
what
the
intent
has
to
be.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
the
defendant
have
to
know
that?
that's
my
question.
does
he
have
to
intend
to
stop
the
witness
from
communicating
this
information
to
someone
that's
related
to
either
a
federal
judge
or
a
federal
law
enforcement
agent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
did
they
go
to
the
federal
authorities
after
2002?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
did
they
go
to
the
federal
authorities
after
2002?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
one
last
one,
the
plain
error
question.
neither
your
brief
--
i
think
you're
taking
the
position
that
simply
because
we
granted
cert,
we've
accepted
there's
a
plain
error;
is
that
your
position?
because
you
haven't
really
defended
against
a
finding
of
plain
error.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
we're
really
--
granted
cert
to
give
an
advisory
opinion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
if
there's
not
plain
error,
how
do
we
reverse
this
court
below?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so,
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
we
announce
the
standard,
hopefully
different
than
the
courts
below
for
your
sake,
and
then
remand
to
then
let
the
court
apply
the
new
standard?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
if
it's
not,
what's
the
other?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
could
we
do
that
unless
we
found
there
was
plain
error?
and
how
can
we
say
there's
plain
error
when
this
question
has
vexed
so
many
courts?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
to
say
to
you
that
even
if
a
bright-line
rule
is
announced,
the
real
work
begins
in
deciding
what
evidence
is
sufficient
to
meet
that
burden.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
you
see--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
a
little
bit
confused.
tell
me
exactly
why
you
see
a
difference
between
"realistically
likely"
or
"reasonably
possible".
tell
me
--
tell
me
what
fine
line
exists
between
those
two
and
what
quantum
of
evidence
more
you
would
need
under
one
as
opposed
to
the
other.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
me
what
the
difference
in
proof
would
look
like.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
"likely"
is
proven?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
you
still
had
to
prove,
didn't
you,
or
wouldn't
you
have
a
measure
of
obligation
to
have
a
witness
get
up
on
the
stand
and
say,
the
fbi
always
looks
at
bank
robberies?
in
the
absence
of
that,
aren't
we
asking
the
jury
to
speculate
that,
merely
because
it
can
be
a
federal
crime
--
bank
robbery
can
be
both
a
state
and
a
federal
--
that
it's
reasonably
possible
it
would
go,
not
everything
you
yourself
said
not
everything
goes
to
the
federal
government,
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
kagan's
hypothetical.
we
--
we
--
there's
no
proof
that
this
particular
officer
who
was
shot
was
going
to
pick
up
the
phone
to
the
fbi.
he
may
have
overheard
this.
he
would
have
called
his
fellow
officers,
and
somebody,
probably
his
supervisor,
or
the
da's
office
was
going
to
make
the
decision
whether
to
call
the
fbi.
so,
how
is
that
different
from
the
cemetery
caretaker,
who
is
going
to
call
it
in
probably
to
9-1-1,
and
he
doesn't
particularly
have
an
idea
of
who's
going
to
get
involved
or
not
because
it's
really
not
his
issue.
why
is
there
a
difference
between
those
two
situations?
and
isn't
the
question,
going
back
to
what
justice
breyer
asked,
was,
what's
the
likelihood
that
this
is
going
to
get
investigated
by
the
federal
government?
why
is
it
reasonably
possible?
anything
is
reasonably
possible
--
or
almost
anything.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i
guess
then
your
burden
is
only
to
show
that
it's
a
federal
offense,
because
why
you
need
to
show
anything
else
because
"reasonably
possible"
encompasses
every
single
federal
offense
or
anything
that
could
be
termed
a
federal
offense.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
know
what
the
difference
was
between
the
state
and
the
federal
penalties?
