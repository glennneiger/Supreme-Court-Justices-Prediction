ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
enacted
section
1512(a)(1)(c),
it
sought
to
protect
the
integrity
of
federal
criminal
investigations
and
prosecutions.
the
statute
requires
the
government
to
prove
four
things
--
an
actus
reus,
a
mens
rea
and
two
federal
nexus
elements,
one
of
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
actus
reus
is
murder,
the
mens
rea
that's
common
to
every
prosecution
under
section
1512(a)(1)(c)
is
an
intent
to
prevent
the
communication
of
information
to
a
law
enforcement
officer.
the
first
federal
nexus
element
requires
that
that
information
relate
to
the
commission
or
possible
commission
of
a
federal
offense;
and
the
second
federal
nexus
element,
the
one
at
issue
in
this
case,
requires
that
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
information
would
have
been
communicated
to
a
federal
officer
if
the
murder
had
not
occurred.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
it
comes
from
trying
to
construe
all
the
different
relevant
provisions
of
the
statute
to
make
sense
together.
section
(a)(1)(c)
specifies
that
a
defendant
has
to
have
an
intent
to
prevent
the
communication
of
the
relevant
information
to
a
law
enforcement
officer;
section
1515
tells
us
that
the
law
enforcement
officer
has
to
be
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer,
that's
the
definitional
section;
and
then
section
1512(g)(2)
specifies
that
the
government
doesn't
need
to
prove
any
state
of
mind
about
the
fact
that
the
officer
is
a
federal
officer.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
in
our
view
there
are
two
different
ways
to
prove
a
violation
of
the
statute.
one
is
if
you
just
read
section
(a)(1)(c),
a
natural
reading
of
that
section
is
that
if
a
--
if
defendant
has
a
specific
intent
to
prevent
a
communication
to
a
federal
officer
specifically,
then
that's
a
violation
of
the
statute.
what
subsection
(g)(2)
tells
us
is
that
you
don't
need
to
prove
a
federal
officer's
specific
intent
for
every
violation
of
the
statute,
but
if
you
can
prove
that,
then
that's
enough.
and
so
in
this
case
there's
no
evidence
that
the
petitioner
had
a
specific
intent
as
to
a
federal
officer,
but,
for
example,
if
officer
horner
had
said,
hey,
i'm
the
fbi
or
hey,
i'm
calling
the
fbi
right
now,
and
then
he
had
killed
him,
that
would
have
been
enough
whether
it
were
true
or
not.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes,
that's
right,
and
in
section
(g)(2)
it's
described
as
a
circumstance
that
the
federal,
that
the
officer
in
question
is
a
federal
officer,
and
so
that's
--
that's
a
fact
in
the
world
that
the
jury
needs
to
make
a
determination
about.
of
course,
it's
a
fact
in
the
world
about--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--that's
okay.
i
was
going
to
say
it's
a
fact
in
the
world
about
something
that
by
--
by
the
design
of
the
defendant
is
never
going
to
happen.
the
communication
that's
at
issue
when
you
--
when
you
don't
have
the
federal
officer's
specific
intent,
is
a
communication
that's
never
going
to
happen,
and
so
the
jury
has
to
make
a
reasonable
prediction
about
what
could
have
happened
in
the
absence
of
the
murder.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
if
they
--
if
they--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--but
if
--
if
the
same--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--so
they
say,
we
have
to
shoot
this
guy
to
keep
him
from
talking
to
the
fbi?
that's
still
a
violation
of
the
statute,
because
they
have
the
requisite
intent
as
to
a
federal
officer.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
just
to
be
clear,
the
realistic
possibility
part
only
comes
in
where
the
defendant
doesn't
have
a
specific
intent
as
to
the
federal
officer
specifically.
so,
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
the
intent
was
to
prevent
a
communication
to
the
fbi
in
particular,
and
if
a
defendant
has
that
specific
federal
officer,
a
specific
intent,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
might
have
happened,
would
have
happened,
could
have
happened.
where
the
reasonable
possibility
standard
comes
in
is
in
cases
like
this
one,
where
the
defendant
has
an
intent
to
prevent
a
communication
to
a
law
enforcement
officer
for
sure,
but
doesn't
have
any
specific
intent
as
to
the
federal
nature.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
i
think
the
jury
instruction
would
say,
you
know,
you
need
to
make
a
determination
about
what
could
have
happened
if
the
murder
hadn't
occurred,
and
if
you
find
that
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
there
would
have
been
a
communication
with
the
federal
officer
--
and
that
can
be
proved
in
any
number
of
different
ways
in
any
particular
case
--
then
you
find
that
there's
a
violation
of
the
statute.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
right.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
i
think
that's
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
the
government
could
live
with,
but
the
effect
of
that--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--but
that
--
indeed.
but
that
is
a
more
aggressive
reading
than
the
reading
we're
offering,
because
congress
went
to
the
extra
step
of
defining
"law
enforcement
officer"
to
mean
"federal
law
enforcement
officer".
so
the
interpretation
you're
positing
would
essentially
read
that
out
of
the
statute.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
right.
the
reason--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
mean,
congress
could
have
written
the
statute
that
way,
but
when
congress
defined
"law
enforcement
officer"
to
mean
"federal
law
enforcement
officer",
presumably,
they
meant
that
to
mean
something.
and
in
(g)(2),
what
they
do
is
they
take
the
federal
nature
of
the
law
enforcement
officer
out
of
the
mens
rea
part
of
the
offense,
but
they
describe
it
as
a
circumstance,
and
so
that
presumably
is
--
has
to
relate
to
something
that
could
have
happened
in
the
world
in
the
absence
of
the
murder.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
correct.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--except
that
not
all
crimes
that
could
be
prosecuted
as
federal
crimes
are
prosecuted
as
federal
crimes.
for
example,
there
are
--
most
drug
crimes
are
prosecuted
by
state
authorities
rather
than
by
federal
authorities,
even
though--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--not
all
of
them.
if--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--no,
it
doesn't.
and
i
think
in
a
particular
case,
if
the
drug
crime
is
the
underlying
crime,
that
could
serve
as
the
predicate
crime.
but
i
think
that
what
matters
is
what
the
jury
has
reason
to
conclude,
and
jurors
generally
don't
understand
the
way
that
the
federal
system
works
vis-a-vis
the
state
system.
and
so
if
there's
no
reason
for
the
jury
to
think
that
the
information
might
have
gone
to
federal
officers,
then
they
wouldn't
have
a
basis
for
a
conviction
under
the
statute.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
you
could
--
you
could
give
that
instruction,
but
i
--
i
think
--
i
took
the
hypothetical
from
justice
scalia
to
be
that
you
wouldn't
need
to
show
that
there's
any
--
any
chance
that
the
communication
would
have
gone
to
a
federal
officer.
and
i
think
that
would
read
the
federal
officer
definition
out
of
the
statute,
if
all
that
was
required
was
that
the
offense
be
a
federal
offense.
and
then
could
you
just
say,
well,
you
know,
in
theory
--
and
it's
true
that
anybody
who
has
information
about
a
commission
of
a
federal
offense,
theoretically,
could
someday
choose
to
give
that
information
to
a
federal
officer,
but
that--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
think
it
would,
justice
alito.
i
think
in
the
first
case,
the
jury
wouldn't
have
a
reasonable
basis
to
conclude
that
the
information
might
have
gone
to
federal
officers
in
the
absence
of
the
murder.
in
the
second
case,
they
would
have
a
very
reasonable
basis
to
make
that
inference.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
defendant's
intent.
again,
there
are
two
different
ways,
in
our
view,
to
prove
a
violation
of
the
statute.
one
is
if
the
defendant
has
a
specific
intent
about
preventing
communication
to
a
specifically
federal
officer.
if
the
federal
nature
of
the
officer
is
in
his
mind,
that's
one
way
to
prove
a
violation
of
the
statute.
if
he
doesn't
have
that
specific
intent,
which
is
going
to
be
in
most
cases,
honestly,
that
are
prosecuted
under
the
statute,
then
you
have
to
prove
that
there's
some
reasonable
possibility
that
that
communication
would
have
happened--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--but
in
your
hypothetical,
which
i
think
you
borrowed
from
justice
alito,
there
was
a
specific
intent
to
prevent
a
communication
with
the
fbi,
and
so
there
they
have
the
federal
officer
specific
intent.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
the
reason
it's
weird
is
because
the
design
of
the
defendant
in
killing
the
victim
is
to
prevent
something
from
happening,
and
then
the
jury
is
asked
to
make
a
--
make
a
determination
of
whether
that
thing
might
have
happened
or
not.
and
so
you
don't
--
if
you
place
too
high
a
burden
on
the
government,
you're
basically
giving
a
defendant
who
acts
efficiently
and
early
in
the
criminal
process
a
leg
up,
because
you're
--
if
you
require
the
government
to
prove
that
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
the
communication
in
question
would
have
happened
with
the
federal
officer,
then
what
you're
doing
is
you're
not
giving
sufficient
protection
to
those
communications
to
federal
officers
that
would
cause
a
federal
investigation
to
be
initiated.
right?
you're
--
it's
not
how--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
i
guess
what
we
see
--
where
we
see
the
--
sort
of
the
ballpark
is,
either
the
government
needs
to
prove
that
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
it
would
have
happened,
or
they
just
need
to
prove
that
it's
a
reasonable
possibility.
and
so
we
would
opt
for
the
second
of
those
two
options.
you
could--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--the
difference
in
proof
--
i
mean,
it
depends
on
the
particular
case.
right?
in
many
of
the
cases
that
are
actually
prosecuted
under
the
statute,
there's
already
a
federal
investigation
underway,
and
in
those
cases,
this
element--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--easy
to
prove,
yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
so
the
cases
that
are
at
issue
are
cases
like
this,
where
the
murder
happens
almost
contemporaneously
with
the
federal
criminal
activity.
and
in
those
cases,
nobody's
had
a
chance
to
even
think
about
initiating
an
investigation,
and
so
--
but
those
initial
communications
are
vital
to
protecting
the
federal
interest
and
protecting
the
integrity
of
federal
investigations.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
right.
and
if
i
--
i
would
like
to
try
to
separate.
there
is
the
question
of
what
is
the
element
of
the
crime,
how
--
how
do
we
define
it,
then
what
--
what
is
the
evidence
you
would
introduce
to
satisfy
that
element.
in
this
case,
certainly
the
government
could
have
introduced
evidence
that
--
that
local
law
enforcement
officers
report
all
evidence
of
bank
robberies
to
the
fbi.
that
would
have
been
enough.
they
didn't
introduce
that
evidence.
what
they
introduced
instead
was
that
when
local
law
enforcement
officers
later
got
the
information
through
other
sources,
they
then
shared
the
information
with
federal
officers.
if
they
hadn't
proven
that,
our
contention
is
it
wouldn't
--
the
evidence
would
not
have
been
sufficient
to
sustain
the
conviction.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
would
be
insufficiently
protective
of
the
federal
interests
to
say
that
you
could
only
--
that
you
would
look
at
what
the
defendant
had
in
mind
about
what
the
chain
of
communication
might
be
if
he
didn't
murder
the
person
who
was
witnessing
the
crime.
most
defendants
don't
think,
wow,
you
know,
if
officer
horner
is
going
to
call
the
dispatch,
the
dispatch
is
going
to
call,
you
know,
the
other
person
in
the
haines
city
police
department,
they're
going
to
call
the
sheriff,
they're
going
to
call
the
federal
law
enforcement
officers,
most
defendants
wouldn't
have
--
wouldn't
be
thinking
down
that
--
sort
of
down
the
chain
of
communication
that
way.
but
the
statute
criminalizes
killing
someone
to
prevent
the
communication,
not
a
communication,
not
a
particular
communication,
but
the
communication
by
any
person
of
information
relating
to
the
commission
of
a
federal
crime.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
mean,
many
of
these
things
are
not
--
in
many
of
these
cases,
this
is
not
an
element
that's
difficult
to
prove.
if,
as
you
say,
it's
a
witness
in
a
particular
investigation
or
is
going
to
testify
in
a
particular
trial
who
has
been
murdered,
then
it's
easy
to
prove
that
the
federal
officer
nexus
has
been
satisfied.
but
congress
was
also
trying
to
protect
information
that
would
cause
federal
investigations
to
be
initiated.
those
are
important
communications.
if
you
allow
murders
of
people
who
witness
crimes
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
reporting
that
information
to
law
enforcement
officers,
where
the
reporting
of
that
information
would
have
caused
a
federal
investigation
to
be
initiated,
then
you're
insufficiently
protecting
the
federal
interest
in
prosecuting
federal
crimes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
not
unless
the
custodian
of
the
cemetery
was
on
his
cell
phone
saying
i'm
calling
911.
so,
if
we
--
what's
important--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
in
terms
of
whether
the
evidence
that
was
presented
in
this
case
was
sufficient,
it
was
sufficient
because
the
jury
knew
two
things.
they
knew,
first,
that
officer
horner
definitely
would
have
communicated
the
information
that's
relevant
in
the
case
to
local
law
enforcement
officers;
and
second,
they
knew
that
when
local
law
enforcement
officers
later
acquired
that
information
from
other
sources,
they
shared
it
with
federal
officers.
so
if
you
didn't
know
the
first
step,
if
you
didn't
know
that
definitely
the
person
who
was
killed
would
have
communicated
to
local
law
enforcement
officers,
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
reason
--
first
of
all,
you
might
not
have
--
have
the
correct
specific
intent
to
prevent
communication
with
a
law
enforcement
officer
which
is
required.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
go
ahead.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
guess
in
our
view
it's
less
important
which
words
you
pick--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--than
it
is
what
they
mean.
and,
so,
if
by
realistic
--
realistic
probability
or
realistic
likelihood--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--right.
and
it's
not
--
it
doesn't
perfectly
map
on
to
the
problem
in
this
case,
of
course,
because
there
is
subsection
(g)(2),
which
specifically
says
you
take
intent
out
of
the
equation.
and,
so,
i'll
concede
it's
an
awkwardly
constructed
statutory
provision.
but
i
think
the
important--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
would
agree
with
that,
so
what
we
would
like--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
we
--
again,
it
depends
what
it
--
what
you
mean
by
realistic
possibility
or
likelihood.
if
you
mean
more
likely
than
not,
then
we
would
say
that's
too
high
a
burden
on
the
government.
we
want
to
include
odd
possibilities
but
not
outlandish
possibilities.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
i
mean,
we
--
we
attach
the
word
reasonably
to
possible
to
sort
of
to
wall
off
cases
that
are
theoretically
possible,
right?
so
again,
we
would
like
to
cover
odd
occurrences
but
not
outlandish
occurrences,
so
it's
not
just
anything
that's
possible.
it's
--
the
jury
has
to
have
a
reason
to
think
it
might
have
happened
in
this
case.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
with
respect,
your
honor,
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
that's
correct.
i
think
there
needs
to
be
a
reason
for
the
jury
to
think
that
if
this
communication
had
not
been
prevented,
the
information
eventually
would
have
gone
to
federal
officers.
the
reason--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--because,
the
reality
is
that
not
information
--
that
all
local
law
enforcement
officers
share
every
piece
of
information
about
federal
offenses
with--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--there's
a
possibility,
but
i
think--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--and
again
that's
--
if
that's
how
the
court
wanted
to
go,
that's
something
the
government
could
live
with.
but--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
there's
a
10-month
lapse
between
when
gamble
went
to
the
local
law
enforcement
officers
and
when
gamble
testified
before
the
federal
grand
jury.
so
presumably
the
federal
--
the
ausa
was
brought
in
sometime
in
that
10-month
period.
so,
it
wasn't
that
long
a
lapse.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
don't
know
the
difference.
i
mean,
gamble
when
he
was
--
hew
was
indicted
eventually
for
14
federal
offenses
to
which
he
pled
guilty
and
was
sentenced
initially
to
life
plus
107
years.
some
of
the
--
some
of
the
crimes
for
which
he
was
indicted
could
not
have
been
prosecuted
in
state
court;
but
presumably
he
could
have
gotten
a
life
sentence
for
murdering
a
police
officer
if
he
had
been
prosecuted
in
state
court
as
well.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no,
we
would
say
it
is
satisfied
if
everything
else
was
the
same.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
because
it
--
it's
still
information
relating
to
the
commission
or
possible
commission
of
a
federal
offense,
we
still
know
that
officer
horner
definitely
would
have
transmitted
that
information
to
local
law
enforcement
officers,
and
we
still
know
that
when
local
law
enforcement
officers
later
got
the
information,
they
would
--
they
transmitted
it
to
federal--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--it's
true.
and
just
to
be
clear,
we're
not
saying
that
that
communication
that
happened
in
2002
is
the
communication
that
was
prevented
or
intended
to
be
prevented.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
fact
when
local
cops
got
the
information
in
2002,
they
shared
it
with
federal
officers,
that
that's
a
reason
for
the
jury
to
infer
that
they
would
have
done
the
same
thing
if
they
had
gotten
the
information--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
i
think--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
of
course,
we
don't
know
what
would
have
happened,
because
officer
horner
was
murdered
to
prevent
any
of
this
from
happening,
but
in
fact,
the
evidence
before
the
jury
suggested
that
it
wasn't
the
murder
that
motivated
them
to
share
the
information
with
federal
officers;
it
was
one
of
the
underlying
robberies.
it
was
the
robbery
of
the
holiday
inn,
which
was
a
federal
offense.
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
on
that
in
state
court,
and
so
they
wanted
to
--
but
they
wanted
to
maximize
the
amount
of
charges
they
could
bring
against
chris
gamble.
and
so
they
decided
to
share
that
information
with
federal
officers.
so
it
wasn't
the
murder
that
made
the
difference;
it
was
one
of
the
underlying
federal
offenses
that
was
charged
against
--
as
one
of
the
predicate
crimes
against
petitioner
here.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it
could,
but
justice
scalia,
i
want
to
point
out
that
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
of
(a)(1),
those
are
the
provisions
that
talk
about
official
proceedings.
subsection
(a)(1)(c),
which
is
the
provision
that's
at
issue
here,
does
not
talk
about
official
proceedings.
it
talks
about
transferring
information
to
federal
--
to
law
enforcement
officers
or
to
judges.
and
so
there
doesn't
--
i
think
by
--
just
by
reading,
sort
of
a
plain
reading
of
those
provisions
together
means
that
for
subsection
(c),
you
don't
need
to
have
an
official
proceeding
that
was
in
anyone's
mind
or
that
was
underway
at
the
time.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it
could,
yes,
and
again,
i
think
if
the
defendant
has
a
federal
officer
specific
intent
in
mind
when
he
commits
the
murder,
that's
enough.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no,
there
is
--
there
is
violation,
if
there's
a
reasonable
possibility--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i'm
not
--
i
don't
mean
to
give
that
--
this
is
a
case
where
there's
not
a
specific
federal
officer
intent.
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
question
as
it
was
put
to
me.
if
there's
no
specific
federal
officer
intent,
but
you
can
prove
that
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
that
one
of
the
communications
prevented
by
the
murder
would
have
been
with
a
federal
officer--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--thank
you.
