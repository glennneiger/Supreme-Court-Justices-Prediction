justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
all
consistent?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
reasonable
likelihood
that
it
would
occur?
i
mean,
he
either
intends
it
or
he
doesn't
intend
it.
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
realistic
likelihood
that
this
person
who
was
killed
might
have
gone
to
a
federal
officer
doesn't
at
all
establish
that
the
intent
of
the
person
who
killed
him
was
to
prevent
him
from
going
to
that
officer,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
stand
on
one
stool
or
the
other
one.
either
it
--
it
relates
to
intent,
as
the
statute
says,
or
all
there
has
to
be
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
this
person
who
was
killed
would
have
gone
to
a
federal
official.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
that
--
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
it
doesn't
talk
about
preventing
a
future
act.
it
doesn't
say
anyone
who
kills
someone
who
would
have
gone
to
a
federal
official
is
--
is
subject
to
this
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
what
it
said,
your
--
your
realistic
likelihood
test
would
be
quite
reasonable,
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
that
the
--
the
killing
has
to
be
with
the
intent
of
preventing
him
from
going.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
a
realistic
likelihood
must
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
a
juror
can
grasp
all
of
that
in
a
juror's
mind?
you
must
find
that
there
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
there
is
a
realistic
likelihood
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
your
answer
would
be
that
if
that
were
the
law,
(a)(1)(c)
would
have
omitted
the
word
"federal".
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
have
said
"by
any
person
to
a
law
enforcement
officer.
"
and
you
would
--
you
would
eliminate
"or
judge
of
the
united
states
--
information
related
to
commission
or
possible
commission
of
a
violation
of
the
law.
"
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
need
that?
i
mean,
we're
always
talking
here
about
--
about
murders
of
a
witness,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
always
talking
about
a
murder
that
was
intended
to
remove
somebody
who
could
incriminate
the
killer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
some
other
crime.
why
isn't
it
enough
to
say
you
killed
that
person
to
prevent
the
disclosure
of
the
crime,
and
if
the
crime
was
a
federal
crime,
the
disclosure
you
were
preventing
was
a
disclosure
to
a
federal
court
or
to
a
federal
police
officer?
why
--
why
do
you
have
to
create
a
--
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
this
person,
this
particular
person,
would
have
gone
to
a
federal
officer
rather
than
a
state
officer?
isn't
it
enough
to
kill
the
person
to
prevent
disclosure
of
the
crime
that
the
crime
was
a
federal
crime?
why
isn't
that
the
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
the
government
could
more
than
live
with
it.
the
government
could
wallow
in
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
the
statute
reads
it
out
of
the
statute.
it
says
in
(g)
that
you
don't
--
the
intent
element
does
--
does
not
require
that
you
know
it's
a
federal
officer
or
that
you
know
it's
a
federal
judicial
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it
enough
that
you
--
you
kill
somebody
to
prevent
the
disclosure
of
a
crime
that's
a
federal
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
rather
strange,
trials?
it's
such
a
weird
issue
to
submit
to
the
jury
in
a
criminal
trial,
you
know,
whether
this
witness
who
was
--
whether
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
this
person
who
was
killed
would
have
gone
to
a
federal
law
enforcement
authority
rather
than
the
state
law
enforcement
authority?
justice
antonin
scalia
miss
harrington,
we
--
we've
gotten
along
for
over
200
years
without
this
particular
federal
law,
and
i,
therefore,
am
not
inclined
to
give
it
a
--
a
sweeping
broad
interpretation,
and
i
think
it's
so
weird
to
submit
to
the
jury,
you
know,
how
likely
is
it
that
this
dead
person
would
have
gone
to
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer
rather
than
a
state
law
enforcement
officer.
why
isn't
an
entirely
satisfactory
reading
of
this
statute
the
following,
that
if
you
--
if,
indeed,
you
have
in
mind
specifically
the
fbi
or
a
federal
proceeding,
you're
done?
if,
however,
you
don't
have
in
mind
specifically
a
federal
proceeding,
but
you
have
in
mind
a
particular
proceeding,
which
is
a
federal
proceeding,
or
a
particular
officer
who
is
a
federal
officer,
then
you're
done,
but
anything
else
isn't
covered?
so
the
intent
has
to
be
the
intent
to
stop
a
particular
proceeding
or
--
or
to
stop
the
person
going
to
a
particular
officer.
if
that
proceeding
is
federal
or
if
the
officer
is
federal,
you
have
the
defendant
--
but
otherwise,
the
laws
that
we've
lived
under
for
210
years
will
continue
to
apply,
and
--
and
--
and
this
new
federal
statute
will
not
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suspect
that
what
this
mainly
addressed
is
--
is
killing
of
witnesses,
which
has
become
very
common
in
some
jurisdictions,
witnesses
in
criminal
trials,
and
you
know
darn
well
what
trial
is
involved.
it's
a
trial
that's
already
underway,
and
if
it's
a
federal
trial
and
you
kill
the
witness,
you're
--
you're
liable
under
this
statute.
what
--
what
is
covered
beyond
that
is
if
--
if
you
know
that
the
information
is
going
to
be
given
to
a
federal
officer,
then
they
have
you
also,
but
i
don't
know
why
we
should
read
the
statute
any
more
broadly
than
that
and
--
and
have
these
weird
questions
submitted
to
the
jury
how
likely
was
it
that
this
--
this
dead
person
would
have
gone
to
a
federal
officer
rather
than
a
state
officer
and
--
and
inquire
into
the
question
that
justice
alito
asked,
you
know,
how
is
there
a
friendly
relationship
between
state
and
local
officials
so
that
the
state
official
would
--
i
don't
want
to
get
into
that.
i
don't
think
the
juries
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
understand
this,
you
mean
it
would
have
been
okay
if
he
went
to
a
lithuanian
movie?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
would
--
would
you
not
acknowledge
that
the
statute
is
vague
enough
that
the
intent
which
it
requires
could
be
either
the
intent
to
prevent
testimony
from
being
given
to
a
particular
federal
proceeding
or
to
a
particular
federal
officer
or
the
specific
intent
to
withhold
it
from
a
proceeding
or
an
officer
who
happens
to
be
or
which
happens
to
be
federal,
but
which
the
defendant
is
not
aware
is
federal?
it
could
bear
that
meaning,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
acknowledge
that,
but
a
particular
judge
or
--
or
the
conduct
of
a
federal
proceeding,
it
could
--
it
could
require
specific
intent
of
a
proceeding
or
a
judge
or
an
officer
which
happens
to
be
a
federal
officer.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
unfair
for
him
to
ask
you
what
my
--
what
my
hypothetical
was.
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
