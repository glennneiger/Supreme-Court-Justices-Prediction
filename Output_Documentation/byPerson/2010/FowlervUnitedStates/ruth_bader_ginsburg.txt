justice
ruth

suppose
the
--
suppose
the
prosecutor
argued
a
realistic
prospect
there.
when
gamble
confessed,
he
confessed
to
the
local
police,
and
they
immediately
communicated
that
information
to
the
federal
prosecutors.
so,
if
that's
what
the
government
counsel
argues,
wouldn't
that
be
a
realistic
prospect
--
wouldn't
they
likely
have
done
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
fowler
that
they
did
with
respect
to
gamble?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
--
what
was
the
time
sequence?
how
much
after
gamble
came
to
the
local
police
did
the
local
police
go
to
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--several
years
after
2002?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
say
before
that
--
that
presenting
this
to
the
jury;
everybody's
worried
about
what
the
jury
will
think;
that
when
gamble
came
and
confessed,
the
local
official
went
to
--
to
the
federal?
i
think
we
were
told
that
there
was
a
year
lapse
between
when
the
local
police
knew
about
gamble's
confession
and
when--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
delicate
about
robbery?
i
mean,
robbery
is
clearly
a
federal
crime,
and
that
was
what
the
--
that
was
what
horner
observed,
and
they
were
--
they
were
planning
for
the
robbery
the
next
day.
