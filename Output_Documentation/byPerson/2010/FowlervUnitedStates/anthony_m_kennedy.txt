justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
--
i
think
justice
alito
can
protect
his
own
question,
but
i
don't
think
you've
answered
it.
you've
put
in
realistic
likelihood.
he's
asked
you
whether
or
not
as
a
matter
of
law,
assuming
that
you're
a
juror
and
you
read
the
statute
and
you
were
instructed
on
the
words
of
the
statute
and
you
have
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
reliability
under
the
statute
under
justice
alito's
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
then
justice
alito's
next
question
--
again,
he
can
protect
his
own
line
of
questioning
--
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
realistic
likelihood?
there's
no
realistic
likelihood;
it
was
only
a
half
of
1
percent
chance
that
the
communication
would
be
made.
so,
that
takes
realistic
likelihood
off
the
table,
and
if
it's
off
the
table,
you
have
to
give
us
a
different
test.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
in
justice
--
please
continue.
i
interrupted
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
two
guys
on
the
park
bench,
and
they
find
out
that
the
man
with
the
gray
coat
behind
them
was
listening.
they
say,
we
have
to
get
the
man
with
the
gray
coat.
they
turn
around
and
they
shoot
a
man
with
a
gray
coat,
but
it's
a
different
man.
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
wasn't
the
man
that
was
listening.
they
got
the
wrong
guy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
intent
was
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
your
realistic
possibility
--
the
realistic
probability
standard
just
falls
out
of
your
test.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
instruct
the
jury,
to
say,
now,
sometimes
there's
realistic
probability,
sometimes
there
isn't.
i
just
don't
know
what
this
jury
instruction
is
going
to
look
like.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
the
defendant's
intent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
you
have
to
change
your
answer
--
right?
maybe
you
don't
--
to
my
hypothetical
where
they
shoot
the
wrong
man.
