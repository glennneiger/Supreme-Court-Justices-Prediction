chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
10-5443,
fowler
v.
united
states.
mr.
crawford.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
--
what
is
your
position
on
the
subsequent
element
or
--
or
feature
about
relating
to
the
commission
or
possible
commission
of
a
federal
offense?
does
the
defendant
have
to
know
that
his
actions
to
prevent
communication
involve
an
underlying
federal
offense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that?
1512(g)(2)
talks
about
with
respect
to
the
law
enforcement
officer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
you'd
say
there's
a
negative
implication
that
intent
has
to
be
shown
with
respect
to
everything
else,
including
whether
or
not
this
is
a
possible
federal
crime.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
willing
to
concede
that
the
defendant
knew
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
harrington.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
--
if
you
have
a
federal
--
underlying
federal
offense,
and
i
gather
you
don't
think
--
that
just
needs
to
be
shown
as
a
matter
of
fact,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no
intent
with
respect
to
that.
isn't
it
always
likely
that
there's
going
to
be
a
reasonable
possibility,
reasonable
likelihood,
that
the
communication
is
going
to
go
to
a
federal
officer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
federal
offense.
if
the
communication
covers
federal
judges,
that's
the
person
who
is
going
to
try
the
case
in
every
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
obviously
not
all
of
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
that
--
that
it's
not
an
element
of
the
crime,
but
that
feature
of
the
prosecution
depends
upon
what
percentage
of
the
crimes
are
prosecuted
federally
as
opposed
to
by
state
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you
instruct
the
jury
that
the
underlying
crime
here
is
a
federal
crime
and
then
say
the
only
thing
they
have
to
determine
under
some
standard
is
whether
or
not
the
communication
would
be
to
a
federal
officer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
why
isn't
that
--
maybe
i
asked
this
already,
but
why
isn't
that
the
case
when
you're
dealing
with
the
federal
offense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
but
there's
a
possibility.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
realistic
possibility.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
crawford,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
