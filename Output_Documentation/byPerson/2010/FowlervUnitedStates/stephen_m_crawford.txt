mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
a
significant
disagreement
between
the
circuit
court
over
what
the
government
must
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
establish
the
violation
of
title
18,
united
states
code,
section
1512(a)(1)(c).
this
death
qualifying
federal
criminal
statute
must
be
construed
clearly,
consistently,
and
narrowly.
yet,
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
in
this
case
conflicts
with
the
rulings
in
factually
similar
cases:
from
the
second
circuit,
lopez,
and
the
fifth
circuit,
causey
and
other
circuit
precedent.
more
specifically--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--it
would
be
our
opinion
they
are
all
inconsistent,
which
is
what
we
need
from
this
court,
your
honor.
the
eleventh
circuit
erred
by
placing
the
word
"possible"
in
the
statute
and,
thus,
significantly
modifying
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
by
proposing
a
standard
of
mere
possibility--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--justice
kagan,
we
would
offer
the
standard
of
realistic
likelihood,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
17
and
page
41,
as
the
appropriate
standard
in
this
particular
case.
that
is
language
that
comes
from
lopez,
the
second
circuit
case,
and
also
places
a
higher
burden
on
the
government,
which
we
believe
is
important
in
order
to
maintain
the
federal/state
balance
that
is
required
in
federal
criminal
matters.
it
is
a
reasonable
standard,
more
reasonable
than
what
we
would
characterize
the
governor's
--
the
government's
standard
of
"reasonable
possible".
in
their
brief,
page
9,
10,
and
13,
they
propose
that,
which,
we
would
add,
differs
from
what
the
eleventh
circuit
said.
if
you'll
remember,
in
lopez,
the
eleventh
circuit
offered
the
standard
"possible".
and
yet,
the
government,
backing
away
from
that
a
bit,
in
their
briefs,
on
page
9,
10,
and
13,
used
the
phrase
"reasonably
possible".
and
while
we
would
concede
it
is
an
improvement
on
the
eleventh
circuit's
mere
possibility
standard,
it
still
is
vague.
it
still
upsets
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--we
believe
that
subsection
(g)
of
the
statute
precludes
the
--
or
takes
the
mens
rea
element
of
the
defendant
off
the
table
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
person
is
a
law
enforcement
official
or
whether
or
not
there's
an
ongoing
federal
criminal
investigation.
we
would
agree
with
you
that
the
law
does
require
that
the
defendant
intend
to
prevent
a
communication.
the
eleventh
circuit
puts
the
word
"possible"
in
there
and
says
intent
to
prevent
a
possible
communication.
and
that's
the
rub,
justice
alito,
that
we're
asking
this
court
to
address.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
we
believe
that
you
define
or
would
find
--
determine
the
defendant's
intent
based
on
the
circumstances
and
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
the
intent
would
have
to
be
a
realistic
likelihood
that
there's
going
to
be
communication.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
gravamen
of
the
offense.
that
intent
element
is
essential.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
we--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--well--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--it
is
our
position
that
we
are
trying
to
determine
or
the
jury
has
to
determine
a
future
act.
the
prevention
of
communication
denotes
the
future
tense
of
the
word
"communicate".
so,
what
standard
should
we
ask
the
jury
to
use
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
government
has
provided
evidence
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
future
act
prevented?
and
so,
it
is--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--well,
your
honor,
we
believe--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--the
intent
to
prevent
the
communication,
the
communication
in
the
future
is
what
is
modified
by
the
word
"prevent".
and
so,
that's
what
we're
--
that's
what
we're
struggling
with,
your
honor.
we're
trying
to
come
up
with
a
standard
as
to
what--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
we
would
urge
the
court
to
pick
a
particular
standard,
if
you're
going
to,
to
help
us
interpret
this
statute
that
would
strike
the
appropriate
balance
between
state
and
federal
criminal
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
we
believe
the
jury
would
make
that
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
likely,
realistically
likely
that
mom
would
report
him
to
federal
law
enforcement
officials.
that's
what
we're
trying
to
do,
is
give
the
lower
courts
or
the
--
or
the
jury--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--the
result
of
the
question
of
intent?
or
what
are
you
asking
the
result
of--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--then
we
would
say,
yes,
that
the
defendant
could
be
found
to
have
violated
the
statute
under
that
particular
hypothetical.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
well,
then,
i
would
go
with
the
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
government
must
prove
in
any
criminal
matter.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
we
would
agree.
that
is--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--well,
we
understand.
and
--
and
we
are
assuming,
of
course,
that
all
elements
of
the
offense
have
to
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
what
we've
tried
to
do
is
provide
the
court
with
some
sort
of
standard
that
the
jury
could
be
instructed
as
to
how
to
prove
that
fourth
element,
and
that
is
this
future
communication.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
we
do.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
i
do,
your
honor.
i
believe--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--we
believe
that
given
the
proper
instructions
and
definitions
of
the
word
"realistic
likelihood"--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--well,
i
would
answer
that
two
ways,
justice
ginsburg.
number
one,
that
is
not
what
happened
in
the
case
below.
once
mr.
gamble
decided
to
--
4
years
after
the
killing
of
officer
horner,
to
talk
to
local
law
enforcement,
it
was
not
immediately
reported
to
the
federal
law
enforcement
officials.
it
was
reported
years
later.
so,
we
don't
have
that
immediacy.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
officer
horner
was
found
dead
on
march
of
1998,
and
he
came
forward
to
the
local
police
in
2002
after
he
was
sentenced
to
20
years
on
an
unrelated
state
robbery.
there
was
then
several
years
before
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
was
contacted,
and
they
decided
to
go
forward
with
the
case
that
is
before
us
today.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
2002
is
when
he
came
forward
and
began
talking
to
law
enforcement.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
i'm
sorry?
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
2003.
almost
--
almost
a
year
afterwards
it
was
--
it
was
taken
over
there.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
no,
your
honor,
they
do
not.
you
basically
take
your
offense
as
you
find
them,
just
as
you
take
your
officer
as
you
find
him,
and
we
believe
that's
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
well,
we
--
we
are
willing
to
concede
that
there
was
a
possible
federal
crime
that
was
occurring
at
the
time
of
officer
horner's
death.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
i'm
willing
to
concede
the
defendant
--
it
need
not
be
proved
that
the
defendant
knew
that.
now,
if
the
government
can
establish
evidence
of
that,
we
believe
that
goes
to
the
defendant's
intent
and
to
a
different
element,
but
the
government
need
not
prove
that
because
we
believe
the
subsection
(g)
takes
that
off
the
table.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
if
that
is
the
reading
of
the
statute,
that
that
would
basically
federalize
murder,
that
there
is
always
going
to
be
some
overlapping
federal
crime
that
is
possible,
or
the
possible
commission
of,
and
if
that
becomes
the
standard
or
the
reading
or
the
interpretation
of
1512,
then
every
case
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
be
prosecuted--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--i
would
agree.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
i
--
i
would
agree
with
you.
the
congress
sought
or
deemed
fit
to
put
the
word
"federal"
in
there
twice,
both
a
federal
offense
and
a
federal
official.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
well,
the
problem,
justice
alito--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--well--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--i'm
not
so
sure
that
holding
up
a
convenience
store
would
not
qualify
under
the
hobbs
act
or
under
some
other
federal
statute
that
a
creative--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--there
are.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
but
there
needs
to
be
proof
--
there
needs
to
be
proof
more
than
just
the
mere
presence
of
a
potential
federal
offense.
i
believe
in
the
third
circuit
opinion
of
bell,
which,
if
i
remember
it
correctly,
when
you
were
serving
on
the
third
circuit,
you
authored
that
opinion,
that
you
set
up
a
standard
that
the
federal
crime
has
to
have
additional
appropriate
evidence
in
order
to
have
a
violation
under
this
statute.
that's
the
problem
we
have
with
this
case,
is
that
we
have
federal
crimes
--
we'll
concede
that;
the
cocaine
and
the
potential
or
conspiracy
to
rob
a
bank
--
but
there
is
no
additional
appropriate
evidence
to
meet
the
standard
here.
so,
using
the
opinion
in
bell,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
find
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--it
would
be
--
it
would
make
the
government's
burden
easier,
because
it
is
more
likely
than
not,
it
is
realistic
likelihood
that
there's
going
to
be
federal
involvement,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
on
a
case
where
it's
a
threat
to
kill
the
president
or
hijacking
or
income
tax,
federal
income
tax.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
well,
i
would
agree
with
that.
certainly
not
in
the
state
of
florida.
i
would
say
that
most
state
attorneys
handle
bank
robberies
as
much
if
not
more
than
the
federal
authorities.
but
we
would
concede
that
bank
robbery
is
a
federal
crime.
that's
why
we
need
something
more
than
just
federal
crime
to
confer
jurisdiction.
we
need
federal
law
enforcement
involvement,
and
we
have
nothing
on
this
record
that
shows
any
involvement
of
federal
law
enforcement.
and
that's
why
the
case
needs
to
be
reversed.
that's
why
the
eleventh
circuit's
standard
of
mere
possibility
is
too
broad,
and
we're
looking
for
a
rule
from
this
court
that
will
narrow
that
and
keep
that
--
that
balance
of
federal
and
state
criminal
jurisprudence
where
it
needs
to
be.
and,
quite
frankly,
if
there's
no
other
questions--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--well,
the
trial
lawyer
did
a
poor
job
in
articulating
the
reasons
for
the
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
well,
unfortunately,
judge,
i
was.
so,
that's
why
i--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--did
a
poor
job
of
articulating
the
judgment
of
--
the
judgment
at
acquittal
time,
the
reasons
that
the
court
should
grant
it
and
quite
frankly
did
disservice
to
the
district
court
judge,
who
we
need
to
help
out
more.
but--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--no.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
well,
we
believe
that
when
the
argument
was
made
at
the
eleventh
circuit,
that
whether
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
issue
was
raised
there,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
chose
not
to
rule
on
that,
but
chose
to
rule
on
a
statutory
construction
of
1512
--
that
then,
when
this
court
granted
cert,
that
basically
took
that
issue
off
the
table.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
that
is
one
possibility.
or--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--the
other
is,
is
to
overrule
the
eleventh
circuit
and
with
instructions
to
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
i
don't
know
at
this
particular
point,
but
i
do
know
that
we
have
a
problem
in
the
circuits,
that
the
standards
being
applied
are
across
the
board;
and
we
need
a
bright
line,
hopefully
a
bright-line
rule,
that
will
help
us
in
the
courts
below
so
we
can
do
our
job
better.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
understood,
but
it's
our
position
that
any
of
the
rules
that
have
been
proposed,
except
maybe
the
mere
possibility,
which
is
overbroad,
there
still
is
nothing
on
this
record
that
is
going
to
show
a
federal
law
enforcement
involvement
or
communication
to
federal
law
enforcement;
and
we're
going
to
win
at
any
point.
that
is
our
fall-back
position
on
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
thank
you,
sir.
i'll
do
better
next
time.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
justice
kagan,
if
i
could
go
to
a
question
that
you
posed:
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
the
mere
presence
of
a
possible
federal
offense
was
appropriate
to
give
federal
jurisdiction
under
this
particular
statute,
then
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
effect
that
that
would
have
on
criminal
practice
throughout
this
country.
there
is
significant
overlap
between
federal
and
state
criminal
laws,
and
if
we
are
simply
going
to
confer
federal
jurisdiction
on
this
particular
statute
because
of
the
mere
possibility
of
a
federal
offense,
you
have
created
a
huge
exception
and,
we
would
respectfully
submit,
create
problems
for
that
delicate
balance
between
state
and
federal.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
justice
ginsburg,
we
would
agree
that
bank
robbery
is
a
federal
crime.
the
question
is:
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
would
show
there
was
going
to
be
any
federal
involvement
in
that
federal
crime?
every
day,
federal
crimes
are
prosecuted
in
the
state
system
under
their
state
crimes,
but
absent
some
federal
involvement,
you
have
obliterated
that
line
between
state
and
federal
criminal
practice,
and
that
is
too
broad,
or
that,
we
believe,
upsets
this
delicate
balance
that
we
must
maintain.
if
i
could,
i
want
to
go
to
lithuania
and
suggest
this.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
cited
at
the
circuit
court
level
that
give
examples
of
how
the
government
can
meet
their
proof,
and
quite
frankly,
it's
not
difficult.
in
romero,
there
is
a
federal
--
ongoing
federal
law
enforcement
official
investigation
going
on,
so
if
there
is
an
ongoing
lithuanian
movie--
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
--i
do.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
exactly.
mr.
stephen
m.
crawford
we
would
argue
that
there
is
--
the
record
is
insufficient
to
establish
reasonable
likelihood
of
federal
involvement.
and
i
can't
put
it
any
better
than
that.
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
