justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
certain
that
this
is
about
the
funeral.
i
mean,
understand
there
was
a
funeral
in
it,
but
the
first
amendment
question
seems
to
me
a
different,
possibly
a
broader
and
different
question.
did
your
client
see
the
signs?
i
gather
from
the
record
he
didn't
see
what
the
signs
were;
he
just
saw
tops
of
signs.
so
he
didn't
read
anything
on
the
signs,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
hadn't
seen
them.
so
how
does
--
how
did
your
client
find
out
that
the
signs,
the
tops
of
which
he
saw
at
the
funeral
when
the
demonstrators
were
standing,
with
the
approval
of
the
police,
300
feet
away,
how
did
he
find
out
what
they
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
they
say
in
--
my
question
is,
how
did
your
client
find
out
these
very
objectionable
things
on
the
signs?
how
did
he
find
out
what
they
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
what
i'm
interested
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
now
we
have
two
questions.
one
is
under
what
circumstances
can
a
group
of
people
broadcast
on
television
something
about
a
private
individual
that's
very
obnoxious,
because
at
the
funeral
you
say
that
--
and
i
accept
that
from
your
point
of
view
--
that
is
very
obnoxious.
and
the
second
is
to
what
extent
can
they
put
that
on
the
internet,
where
the
victim
is
likely
to
see
it,
either
on
television
or
by
looking
it
up
on
the
internet?
now,
those
are
the
two
questions
that
i
am
very
bothered
about.
i
don't
know
what
the
rules
ought
to
be
there.
that
is,
do
you
think
that
a
person
can
put
anything
on
the
internet?
do
you
think
they
can
put
anything
on
television
even
if
it
attacks,
say,
the
most
private
things
of
a
private
individual?
does
maryland's
--
does
maryland's
law
actually
prohibit
that?
do
we
know
it
does,
and
what
should
the
rules
be
there?
have
i
said
enough
to
get
you
talking?
[laughter.]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
more
you
say
about
this
the
happier
i
will
be,
because
i'm
quite
interested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
--
taking
--
if
you
have
an
instance
where
the
defendant
has
said
on
television
or
on
the
internet
something
absolutely
outrageous,
you
showed
that.
you
show
that
it
was
intended
to
and
did
inflict
serious
emotional
suffering.
you
show
that
any
reasonable
person
would
have
known
that
likelihood,
and
then
the
defendant
says:
yes,
i
did
that,
but
in
a
cause,
in
a
cause.
and
now
--
in
a
cause
that
we
are
trying
to
demonstrate
how
awful
the
war
is.
at
that
point
i
think
the
first
amendment
might
not
leave
this
alone.
but
if
it's
not
going
to
leave
this
alone,
there's
where
we
need
a
rule,
or
we
need
an
approach
or
we
need
something
to
tell
us
how
the
first
amendment
in
that
instance
will
begin
to
--
enter
and
force
a
balancing.
is
it
that
you
want
to
say
no,
no
punitive
damages
in
such
a
case?
or
that
you
would
have
to
insist
upon
a
particularly
clear
or
a
reasonable
connection
between
the
private
part
of
this
and
the
public
effort?
have
you
thought
about
that
at
all?
because
that's
where
i
am
thinking
and
having
trouble.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
hustler
--
hustler
v.
falwell
is
defamation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
intentional
infliction,
okay,
good.
thank
you.
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
answer
then,
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
compelling.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
are
still
so
worried
about
the
statements
on
television
and
on
the
internet
and
the
knowledge
there.
and
i'm
not
--
i'm
still
starting
--
and
i
am
trying
to
get
the
same
answer
from
you
i
was
trying
to
get
from
your
colleague.
brandeis
said
the
right
to
be
let
alone
was
the
most
important,
and
so
he
must
have
been
thinking
there
could
be
a
tort
there
for
interference
with
privacy,
and
the
first
amendment
doesn't
stop
state
tort
laws
in
appropriate
circumstances.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
emotional
injury,
deliberately
inflicted,
could
be
one.
now,
and
i
think
it
is
one,
but
i
see
that
in
some
instances
that
could
be
abused
to
prevent
somebody
from
getting
out
a
public
message,
and
therefore,
i'm
looking
for
a
line.
now,
let
me
suggest
a
couple
and
see
what
you
think,
and
maybe
you
can
think
of
some
others.
you
could
have
a
judge
make
the
decision,
since
the
first
amendment
is
involved,
not
the
jury,
and
the
judge
could
say
whether
in
this
instance
it
was
reasonable
for
the
defendant
to
think
that
it
was
important
to
interfere
with
the
emotional
life
of
that
individual.
you
could
say
if
that
was
so,
there
will
still
be
no
--
there
would
be
no
punitive
damages.
there
could
be
ordinary
damages.
you
could
remove
all
protection
from
the
defendant
in
an
instance
where
the
defendant
nonetheless
knew,
actually
knew,
that
they
were
going
to
cause
an
individual
who's
private
severe
injury,
emotional
injury,
irrespective
of
their
public
message.
so
what
i'm
doing
is
suggesting
a
number
of
thoughts
of
ways
of
trying
to
do
what
i'm
trying
to
accomplish,
to
allow
this
tort
to
exist
but
not
allow
the
existence
of
it
to
interfere
with
an
important
public
message
where
that
is
a
reasonable
thing
to
do.
now,
maybe
this
is
impossible,
this
task.
but
i
would
like
your
thoughts
on
it.
