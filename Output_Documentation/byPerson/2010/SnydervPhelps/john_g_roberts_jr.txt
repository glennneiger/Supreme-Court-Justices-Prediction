chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
09-751,
snyder
v.
phelps.
mr.
summers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
were
you
finished
answering
justice
breyer's
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
have
no
objection
if
the
sign
said
"get
out
of
iraq",
an
antiwar
protest,
in
other
words
not
directed
at
this
particular
individual?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
no
objection
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
perhaps
you
would
like
to
answer
justice
alito's
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
phelps.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
alito's
question?
do
you
think
the
first
amendment
would
bar
that
cause
of
action
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
there
are
situations
where
a
tort
of
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
is
allowed,
even
for
a
matter
of
public
debate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
understood
the
hypothetical,
that
the
person
disagreed
with
the
war
in
iraq
and
the
sending
of
american
troops
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
person
selects
the
grandmother
because
he
thinks
that
will
give
maximum
publicity
to
his
views.
now,
is
--
does
the
first
amendment
bar
that
cause
of
action
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
no
--
justice
--
justice
alito
posed,
the
grandmother
was
returning
from
the
grave
of
her
grandson.
she
didn't
enter
the
public
discussion
at
all.
so
i'm
anxious
to
determine
whether
in
those
circumstances
you
think
the
first
amendment
allows
that
cause
of
action
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
it
satisfies
the
normal
tort
or
law
against
stalking
for
someone
to
come
up
to
an
individual
and
engage
in
discussion?
i
thought
a
lot
more
was
required.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
response
--
your
response
to
justice
alito
is
dwelling
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
interested
in
knowing
what
your
position
is
on
the
broader
question.
can
you
imagine
a
circumstance
where
this
same
type
of
discussion
is
directed
at
an
individual
and
yet
would
give
rise
to
the
tort
of
emotional
distress?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
can
or
cannot?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
if
you
recognize
that
there
can
be
a
tort
of
emotional
distress
in
circumstances
like
that,
isn't
that,
the
factual
question
of
whether
it
rises
to
that
level
of
outrageousness,
which
is
part
of
the
tort
for
the
jury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
make
--
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
make
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--does
it
make
a
difference,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
the
case
here,
that
mr.
snyder
was
selected
not
because
of
who
he
was,
but
because
it
was
a
way
to
get
maximum
publicity
for
your
client's
particular
message?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
assuming
it
is
accurate,
does
that
make
a
difference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
might
affect
whether
or
not
the
selection
inflicts
emotional
distress
for
a
reason
unconnected
with
the
individual
who
is
the
subject
of
the
emotional
distress.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
if
the
person
is
selected
because,
as
i
indicated,
it
gives
maximum
publicity,
rather
than
because
of
a
particular
connection
to
the
matter
of
public
debate,
i
wonder
if
that
makes
a
difference.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so
that
what
if
--
did
mr.
snyder,
the
father,
become
a
public
figure
simply
because
his
son
was
killed
in
iraq?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
he
didn't
take
out
--
if
he
didn't
take
out
the
usual
obituary
notice,
then
this
case
should
come
out
the
other
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
well,
let's
just
say
he
does
nothing.
he
does
nothing
other
than
bury
his
son.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
is
then
not
a
public
figure?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
because
if
he
does
nothing
and
it's
not
publicized,
you
don't
get
the
maximum
publicity
that
your
clients
are
looking
for.
my
question
is,
if
he
simply
buries
his
son,
is
he
a
public
figure
open
to
this
protest,
or
--
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
phelps.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
summers,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
summers.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
members
of
the
westboro
baptist
church
believed
that
god
hates
and
punishes
the
united
states
for
among
other
things
it's
tolerance
of
homosexuality,
particularly
in
america's
military.
the
church
has
chosen
to
communicate
these
views
by
picketing
at
military
funerals
and
has
frequently
done
so
for
the
past
20
years.
fred
phelps
who
founded
the
church
and
six
westboro
baptist
parishioners,
all
of
them
happen
to
be
related
to
phelps,
traveled
to
maryland
to
picket
the
funeral
of
marine
lance
corporal
matthew
snyder,
who
was
killed
in
iraq
in
the
line
of
duty.
the
picketing
took
place
on
public
land
approximately
1000
feet
from
the
catholic
church
where
the
funeral
was
held.
the
signs
carried
by
the
parishioners
stated,
for
example,
thank
god
for
dead
soldiers,
fags
doom
nations,
thank
god
for
9/11,
america
is
doomed,
hope
in
hell
and
god
hates
you.
the
picketers
displayed
their
signs
for
about
30
minutes
before
the
funeral
began.
matthew
snyder's
father,
the
petitioner
here,
saw
the
tops
of
the
particular
--
particular
picketer
signs
when
driving
to
the
funeral
but
did
not
learn
what
was
written
on
the
signs
until
watching
a
news
broadcast
later
that
night.
mr.
snyder
sued
phelps,
two
of
his
daughters
who
had
participated
in
the
picketing
and
the
westboro
baptist
church
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
a
tort
under
state
law.
a
jury
held
westboro
liable
for
$7
million
in
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
westboro
challenged
the
verdict
on
the
ground
that
the
first
amendment
fully
protected
its
speech.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
agreed
with
westboro
and
we
granted
certiorari.
the
free
speech
clause
of
the
first
amendment
can
serve
as
a
defense
in
state
court
suits
including
suits
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
whether
the
first
amendment
prohibits
holding
westboro
liable
for
its
speech
in
this
case
turns
largely
on
whether
that
speech
is
a
public
or
private
concern.
we
have
explained
in
our
prior
cases
that
speech
on
public
issues,
"is
more
than
self-expression,
it
is
the
essence
of
self-government”,
and
is
therefore
entitled
to
special
protection.
as
we
have
also
explained
in
our
prior
cases
speech
on
matters
of
private
concern
is
different.
in
such
a
case,
“there
is
no
threat
to
the
free
and
robust
debate
of
political
issues
and
there
is
no
potential
interference
with
the
meaningful
dialogue
of
ideas.”
deciding
whether
a
speech
is
a
public
or
private
concerns
requires
us
to
examine
all
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
speech,
what
was
said,
where
it
was
said
and
how
it
was
said.
the
content
of
westboro's
signs
plainly
relates
to
broad
issues
of
interest
to
society
at
large.
well
the
church's
messages
may
fall
short
of
refined
social
or
political
commentary
the
issues
they
highlight,
the
political
and
moral
conduct
of
united
states
and
its
citizens,
the
faith
of
our
nation,
homosexuality
in
the
military
and
scandals
involving
the
catholic
clergy
are
matters
of
public
import.
even
if
a
few
of
westboro
signs
were
viewed
as
containing
messages
related
to
matthew
snyder
or
the
snyder's
specifically,
that
would
not
change
the
fact
that
the
overall
thrust
and
dominant
theme
of
the
church's
demonstration
spoke
to
broader
public
issues.
westboro
conveyed
its
views
on
these
matters
of
public
concern
by
picketing
at
a
public
place
adjacent
to
a
public
street.
such
space
has
historically
occupied
a
favored
position
in
terms
of
first
amendment
protection.
as
we
have
explained
in
our
prior
cases,
“time
out
of
mind,
public
streets
and
sidewalks
have
been
used
for
public
assembly
and
debate.”
westboro
conducted
its
picketing
peacefully.
it
alerted
local
authorities
to
its
plan
protest
and
fully
complied
with
police
guidance
on
where
the
picketing
could
be
staged.
the
picketing
was
conducted
under
police
supervisions,
some
1000
feet
from
the
church
out
of
the
sight
of
those
at
the
church.
the
protest
was
not
unruly.
there
was
no
shouting,
profanity
or
violence.
the
church's
decision
to
conduct
its
demonstration
in
conjunction
with
matthew
snyder's
funeral
made
the
expression
of
westboro's
views
particularly
hurtful
to
many,
especially
to
matthew's
father.
the
record
makes
clear
that
the
applicable
legal
term
"emotional
distress"
fails
to
capture
fully
the
anguished
westboro's
choice
added
to
mr.
snyder's
already
in
calculable
brief.
and
of
course,
westboro
chose
the
time
and
place
for
it's
picketing
to
increase
publicity
for
its
views
as
it
has
for
20
years.
but
that
does
not
change
the
fact
that
the
church
was
engaged
in
peaceful
picketing,
addressing
matters
of
public
concern
on
a
public
street.
the
jury
here
was
instructed
that
it
could
hold
westboro
liable
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
based
on
the
finding
that
westboro's
conduct
was
“outrageous.”
but
in
the
case
such
as
this,
there
is
a
real
danger
that
a
jury
would
punish
westboro
simply
because
the
jury
disagreed
with
westboro's
controversial
but
peacefully
expressed
views
on
matters
of
public
concern.
as
we
have
made
clear
in
our
precedents,
“if
there
is
a
bedrock
principle
underlying
the
first
amendment,
it
is
that
the
government
may
not
prohibit
the
expression
of
an
idea
simply
because
society
finds
the
idea
itself
offensive
or
disagreeable.”
the
jury
verdict
imposing
tort
liability
on
westboro
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
must
be
set
aside.
our
holding
today
is
narrow.
we
are
required
in
first
amendment
cases
to
carefully
review
the
record
and
the
reach
of
our
opinion
here
is
limited
by
the
particular
facts
before
us.
westboro
believes
that
america
is
morally
flawed.
many
americans
might
feel
the
same
about
westboro.
westboro's
funeral
picketing
is
certainly
hurtful
and
its
contribution
to
public
discourse
may
be
negligible.
but
westboro
address
matters
of
public
import
on
public
property
in
a
peaceful
manner
and
full
compliance
with
the
guidance
of
local
officials.
the
speech
was
indeed
planned
to
coincide
with
matthew
snyder's
funeral
but
did
not
itself
disrupt
that
funeral.
and
westboro's
choice
to
conduct
it's
picketing
at
that
time
and
place
did
not
alter
the
nature
of
its
speech.
speech
is
powerful.
it
can
stir
people
to
action,
move
into
tears
of
both
joy
and
sorrow
and
as
it
did
here,
inflict
great
pain.
on
the
facts
before
us,
we
cannot
react
to
that
pain
like
punishing
the
speaker.
as
a
nation,
we
have
chosen
a
different
course
to
protect
even
hurtful
speech
on
public
issues
to
ensure
that
we
do
not
stifle
public
debate.
that
choice
requires
that
we
shield
westboro
from
tort
liability
for
its
picketing
in
this
case.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
