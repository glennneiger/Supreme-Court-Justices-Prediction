mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
members
of
the
westboro
baptist
church
entered
an
ongoing,
extensive,
public
discussion
and
wide
array
of
expressive
activities
taking
place
in
direct
connection
with
the
deaths
and
funerals
of
soldiers
killed
in
iraq
and
afghanistan,
they
did
so
with
great
circumspection
and
they
did
so
with
an
awareness
of
the
boundaries
that
have
been
set
by
the
precedents
of
this
court.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
any
non-speech
activity
like
stalking,
following,
importuning,
being
confrontational,
could
indeed
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
my
answer,
justice
kagan,
is:
no,
i
don't
believe
that
that
person
should
have
a
cause
of
action
or
would
under
your
cases
have
a
cause
of
action.
you
couldn't
give
that
cause
of
action
without
direct
reference
to
the
viewpoint,
which
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
we
agree
that
fighting
words
are
less
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
i
will
go
with
unprotected,
justice
scalia.
and
if
i
may
add
this:
fighting
words
require
imminence,
they
require
proximity,
and
they
require
a
lack
of
those
words
being
part
of
a
broader
political
or
social--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
i
get
the
notion
from
the
series
of
cases
starting
within
7
years
after
your
chaplinsky
case
with
the
gooding
case
and
on
down
through
the
brandenburg
case
and
on
down--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--that
say
that--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--the
--
the
definition,
the
working
definition
of
"fighting
words",
is
that
they
have
to
be
words
which
by
their
nature
are
likely
to
incite
an
immediate
breach
of
the
peace
and
not
occur
in
the
context
of
some
social,
artistic,
educational,
or
political
kind
of
speech.
and
if
i
may
hasten
to
add,
justice
scalia,
these
respondents
were
not
charged
with
fighting
words.
the
jury
was
not
instructed
to
limit
themselves
to
fighting
words.
no
element
of
the
tort
under
which
liability
attached
included
fighting
words.
the
words
that
were
at
issue
in
this
case
were
people
from
a
church
delivering
a
religious
viewpoint,
commenting
not
only
on
the
broader
public
issues
that
the
discussion
was
underway
in
this
nation
about
dying
soldiers,
about
the
morals
of
the
nation--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--right.
so
several
pieces
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
when
i
hear
the
language
"exploiting
the
bereavement",
i
look
for:
what
is
the
principle
of
law
that
comes
from
this
court?
and
the
principle
of
law,
as
i
understand
it,
is
without
regard
to
viewpoint,
there
are
some
limits
on
what
public
places
you
can
go
to,
to
deliver
words
as
part
of
a
public
debate.
if
you
stay
within
those
bounds
--
and
under
these
torts
even,
this
notion
of
exploiting,
it
has
no
definition
in
a
principle
of
law
that
would
guide
people
as
to
when
they
could
or
could
not.
and
if
i
may--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--in--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--with
a
--
yes,
justice
alito,
and
with
a
little
bit
more
from
your
cases,
if
i
may:
and
not
under
an
inherently
subjective
standard,
and
where
you're
only
claiming
that
the
impact
of
the
speech
was
adverse
emotional
impact.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
right.
and
--
and
it
may
give
rise
to
some
fighting
words
claim,
depending
on
the
proximity
and
the
context.
and
i
would
have
to
know
what--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--yes.
let
us
assume
that
the
grandmother
had
not
done
what
mr.
snyder
did
in
this
case.
mr.
snyder
from
the
moment
he
learned
of
his
son's
death
went
to
the
public
airways
multiple
times
in
the
days
immediately
before
and
immediately
after--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--there
would
have
to
be
a
very
narrow
circumstance
where
it
didn't,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
my
answer.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
not
public
debate,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
not
the
way
i
understood
the
hypothetical
he
posed
me.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
right,
and
knew
that
this
elderly
woman
was
the
grandmother
of
a
soldier.
and
i
would
ask
the
question
in
the
hypothetical,
how
they
knew,
which
is
why
i
was
making
reference
to
what
mr.
snyder
did.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
if
the
grandmother
entered
the
public
discussion,
the
first
amendment
bars
it.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
i
am
reluctant
to
say
that
it
does
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
however--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--right.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
and
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
liken
it
to,
and
that's
what
it
sounds
more
like
to
me.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
not
file
that
claim
for
that
person,
for
that
elderly
grandmother.
i
am
not
prepared,
without
knowing
more,
to
say
absolutely
there
could
be
no
cause
of
action.
what
i
am
prepared
to
say
is
there
was
absolutely
much
more
than
that
in
this
case.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
not
the
deceased
person,
justice
alito.
we
don't
allege
that
the
young
man
dead
was
a
public
figure.
we
do--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--yes.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
right.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
it's
getting
closer.
and
justice
alito,
if
she
went
on
then
to
say,
and
how
many
more
parents
like
me
and
my
ex-wife
are
going
to
have
to
suffer
this
way
and
when
will
this
senseless
war
end,
and
i've
gotten
congressman
murtha
on
the
phone
and
talked
about
this
situation,
and
i'm
against
the
war,
and
then
proceeded
to
repeat
that
question
in
the
public
airwaves
repeatedly,
then
a
little
church
where
the
servants
of
god
are
found
say,
we
have
an
answer
to
your
question
that
you
put
in
the
public
airwaves
and
our
answer
is
you
have
got
to
stop
sinning
if
you
want
this
trauma
to
stop
happening--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--yes,
sir.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
yes,
i
can
imagine,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
i
can.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
i
can
imagine
that
there
could
be
a
circumstance,
a
hypothetical,
where
there
was
not
this
level
of
involvement,
and
it
was
out
of
the
blue
and
it
was
up
close,
if
i
may
use
the
term,
confrontational.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
i
don't
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
you
have
now
taken
an
inherently
subjective
standard
with
the
absence
of
any
of
these
non-speech
misbehaviors.
and
now
you
are
back
to
only
--
the
only
barrier
between
a
person
and
their
first
amendment
right
to
robust
public
debate,
including
this
court
has
said,
outrageous
statements--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--with
just
that
subjectively
inherent
standard,
and
that
subjective
statement
of
emotional
impact.
this
court
has
said
repeatedly--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--we
won't
let
that
go.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
that
is
not
accurate,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
due
respect.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
the
motive
of
the
speaker
to
get
maximum
exposure,
which
every
public
speaker
pines
for,
looks
for,
strives
for,
and
is
entitled
to
--
does
not
change
the
legal
principle
that's
at
play.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
well,
if--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--i
think
it
makes
a
difference
when
you
are
looking
at
what
role
the
plaintiff
had
in
that
public
discussion
and
how
tied
the
words
that
they
seek
to
punish
are
to
his
role
in
that
public
discussion.
i
think
that's
how
you
get
to
the
point--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--i'm
saying
it
does
make
a
difference,
and
no
--
but
no,
there
would
not
be
a
claim
there
in
my
opinion
because--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--it
is
a
difference
that
matters
in
some
measure,
i
believe,
justice
kagan,
in
this
light.
i
believe
that
the
umbrella
of
protection
under
the
first
amendment
that
this
court
has
established
firmly
is
speech
on
public
issues.
sometimes
you
get
under
that
umbrella
because
it's
a
public
official
or
it's
a
public
figure,
but
the
umbrella
that
you
give
the
protection
for
is
speech
on
public
issues.
now,
when
a
plaintiff
comes
to
your
court
and
says,
i
want
$11
million
from
a
little
church
because
they
came
forth
with
some
preaching
i
didn't
like,
i
think
it
does
make
a
difference
for
the
court
to
look
closely
at
what
role
did
that
man
have
in
that
public
discussion.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
absolutely,
justice
alito.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
i
think
the
issue
of
race
is
a
matter
of
public
concern.
i
think
approaching
an
individual
up
close
and
in
their
grille
to
berate
them
gets
you
out
of
the
zone
of
protection,
and
we
would
never
do
that.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
well,
but
again,
this
court
has
given
substantial,
longstanding
protection
to
speech
on
public
issues,
and
how
could
it
be
gainsaid
that
the
dying
soldiers
is
not
on
the
lips
of
everyone
in
this
country?
and
it
is
a
matter
of
great
public
interest
and
why
they
are
dying,
and
how
god
is
dealing
with
this
nation.
were
you
to
consult
the
joint
appendix
and
see
that
at
the
very
same
funeral,
right
outside
the
front
door
of
the
church,
were
people
with
flags
and
signs
articulating
the
"god
bless
america"
viewpoint,
and
so
this
little
church--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--not
follow--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--yes,
i
will
help
you,
justice
kennedy
and
i
am
pleased
to
do
that.
because
we
don't
do
follow-around
in
this
church.
we
were
1,000
feet
away,
7
picketers,
1,000
feet
away,
out
of
sight,
out
of
sound,
not
just
standing
where
the
police
said
to
stand--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--for
harassing
conduct,
not
for
speech.
not
for
public
speech,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
i
agree
with
that.
and
there
has
never
been
any
allegation
in
this
case
that
the
words
of
the
westboro
baptist
church
were
in
any
category
of
low-value
or
less
protected
speech.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
i
believe
that
your
cases
give
some
good
light
on
that,
justice
scalia.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
there
may
be
in
some
people's
mind
an
element
of
subjectivity.
my
20
years--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--well,
because
the
court
said
it
was
inherently
subjective
in
the
falwell
case.
and
i
think
that
the
language
that
justice
kagan
brought
forth,
and
there's
a
few
more
paragraphs
that
follow,
identify
why
it's
inherently
subjective.
and
the
way
this
case
was
tried
identifies
why
it
was
inherently
subjective,
where
although
two
signs
and
then
three
were
identified
as
actionable
by
a
strange
reading
of
those
words,
all
of
the
preachments
of
westboro
baptist
church,
including
all
of
the
signs
at
that
picket,
all
of
the
other
signs
at
other
pickets,
and
all
their
doctrines,
went
to
a
jury
with
that
inherent--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
must
hasten
to
say
this:
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
fighting
words
doctrine.
i
do
think
it
has
problems.
i
just
don't
think
it
applies
in
this
case.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
and
especially
not
to
where
there's
just
emotional
injury.
that's
where
i
particularly
think,
although
chaplinsky
would
have
suggested
in
some
broad
language
you
would
go
that
way,
you
have
not
gone
that
way
in
any
of
the
cases.
and
again,
i
have
to
reiterate,
you
have
required
immediacy
and
intent.
whether
a
fight
ensues
or
not,
i
do
understand
that
hasn't
been
pinned
down
as
a
requirement.
but
in
intent,
it's
your
purpose,
is
to
mix
it
up
with
somebody,
not
to
go
out
and
say:
nation,
hear
this
little
church.
if
you
want
them
to
stop
dying,
stop
sinning.
that's
the
only
purpose
of
this
little
church.
1,000
feet
away
could
not
possibly
be
fighting
words.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
right.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
and
i'm
taking
that
we
are
speaking
now
of
the
intrusion
claim,
and
i
believe
that
i
could
offer
you
a
compare
and
contrast,
two
extremes
that
may
help
us
here.
on
the
one
hand,
you
have
a
body
of
law
that
comes
under
the
heading
of
captive
audience.
and
you
can
go
into
that
body
of
law
and
read
all
those
cases
in
one
sitting,
so
to
speak,
from
which
you
would
conclude
that
it
is
very
narrow,
it
is
very
limited,
and
there
must
be
some
actual
physical
sound,
sight,
intrusion,
if
you
are
talking
about
invasion
of
privacy.
at
the
other
extreme,
for
a
compare
and
contrast,
is
what
they
seek
in
this
case,
what
the
trial
judge
gave
them
in
this
case,
which
is:
in
an
unspecified
period
of
time
that
each
individual
will
call
their
mourning
period,
no
one,
at
any
time,
any
place,
any
manner,
may
say
any
word
that
that
mourner
says
caused
me
emotional
distress.
that
would
chill
too
much
speech.
ms.
margie
j.

if
we

i
believe,
justice
sotomayor,
that
the
line
is
where
it
was
in
this

where
the

to

a

know
that
i
can
give
you
a
definitive
answer
as
you
have
framed
it.
what
i
can
tell
you
is
that
i
think
the
court
would
have
great
difficulty
making
a
rule
of
law
that
whether
you
call
yourself
private,
public,
limited,
whatever,
you
--
not
the
person
you're
mad
at
over
their
words
--
but
you
step
into
the
public
discussion
and
make
some
public
statements,
and
then
somebody
wants
to
answer
you.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--i
don't
allege
that
here.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
it's
not
the
obituary
notice,
mr.
chief
justice,
he
went
far
beyond
that.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
right.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
if
he
does
nothing
we
don't
picket
him.
and
i
don't
know--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--i
don't
know
in
the
context
of
a
war,
if
i
can
give
a
definitive
answer
to
that.
it
was
not
an
issue
of
seeking
maximum
publicity;
it
was
an
issue
of
using
an
existing
public
platform
to
bring
a
viewpoint
that
was
not
being
articulated.
for
two
years
this
church--
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
--how
--
by
however
you
call
it
justice
alito,
a
church
or
anybody
has
the
right
to
answer
that
public
comment;
that
is
our
position.
ms.
margie
j.
phelps
thank
you.
