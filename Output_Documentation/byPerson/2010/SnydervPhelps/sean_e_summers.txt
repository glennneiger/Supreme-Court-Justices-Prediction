mr.
sean
e.
summers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
talking
about
a
funeral.
if
context
is
ever
going
to
matter,
it
has
to
matter
in
the
context
of
a
funeral.
mr.
snyder
simply
wanted
to
bury
his
son
in
a
private,
dignified
manner.
when
the
respondent's
behavior
made
that
impossible,
mr.
snyder
was
entitled
to
turn
to
the
tort
law
of
the
state
of
maryland.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
there
was
a
flyer
that
was
sent
out
prior
to
the
funeral.
we
have
the
funeral
and
we
have
what
they
described
as
the
epic
which
was
put
on
the
internet
afterwards,
which--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--as
the
district
court
explained,
and
the
circuit
court
followed
their
logic,
and
i
think
the
facts
at
trial
confirmed
this,
that
the
epic
was
essentially
a
recap
of
the
funeral
protest
itself.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
well,
the--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--well,
we
had
the
flyer
that
was
submitted,
that
was
sent
out
before
the
funeral.
we
have
the
facts
of
the
funeral.
and
yes,
the
epic
did
--
of
course,
we
focused
on
the
personal,
targeted
comments
in
the
epic
when
we
presented
our
evidence.
but
yes,
it
was--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--i
think
that's
a
closer
call.
but
when
we
have
the
personal--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--i
would
say
yes,
because
we
have
the
personal,
targeted
epithets
directed
at
the
snyder
family.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
well,
the
--
he
has
a
cause
of
action.
that
doesn't
mean
he's
going
to
win.
you
still
have
the
pleading
standards,
the
summary
judgment
standards,
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
standards.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
justice
ginsburg,
the
statute
wasn't
in
place
at
the
time.
but
there's
a
complicated
answer
to
the
question,
because
they
were
positioned
about
30
feet
from
the
main
vehicle
entrance
to
the
church,
and
they
rerouted
the
funeral
procession
so
they
were
200
to
300
feet
away
from--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--well,
they
--
they
told
the
police
where
they
wanted
to
stand
and
the
police
said
okay.
so
the
police
didn't
say,
please
stand
here.
they
said
--
in
fact,
they
sent
out
a
flyer--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--it's
true
they
did
not
violate
any
criminal
statutes.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
i
believe
the
maryland
legislature
made
it
clear
that
they
didn't
want
people
to
protest
funerals
in
general.
when
you--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--they
didn't
prohibit
it
under
certain
circumstances
and
in
a
certain--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--for
statutory
enforcement.
but
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
tort
law.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
that's
our
position,
yes,
justice
scalia.
and--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--they
picketed,
yes,
those
three
locations
that
day.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
i
don't
think
they
could
have
beforehand
because
although
you
said
we
knew
what
the
signs
were
going
to
be,
generally
from
their
pattern
i
think
we
could
guess
what
the
signs
may
have
been,
but
you
don't
really
know
what
the
signs
are
going
to
be
until
they
show
up.
for
example,
in
this
case,
they
had
a
sign
that
said
"priests
rape
boys",
they
had
a
sign
that
said
"god
hates
you,
you
are
going
to
hell.
"
mr.
sean
e.
summers
as
--
justice
ginsburg,
from
our
perspective,
the
signs
that
said
"god
hates
you,
you
are
going
to
hell.
"
referred
directly
to
matthew
snyder
and
we
would
hope
and
believe
that
the
district
court
could
enjoin
those
types
of
specific
targeted
epithets.
if,
for
example,
this
was
done
at
a
public
park
in
montana,
logically
i
think
you
could
conclude
that
it
wasn't
directed
at
the
family.
but
when
you
show
up
at
a
20-year-old
marine's
funeral
and
say
"you
are
going
to
hell"--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--they
had
--
the
majority
of
the
signs
were
the
same,
yes.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
yes.
i
believe
the
only
ones
that
they
changed
is
they
have
a
sign
for
each
different
branch
of
the
service.
matt
was
a
marine,
so--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--if
we
are
forced
to
accept
their
view,
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
what
they
testified
to.
mr.
snyder's
view,
the
view
of
the
fourth
circuit,
was
that
these
mr.
snyder
certainly
interpreted
that
as
referring
to
his
son,
because
after
all
matthew
snyder
was
the
only
deceased
marine/soldier
at
the
funeral.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
the
v.
falwell.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
it
can
shed
light,
but
if
you
put
this
in
the
context
of
a
funeral-goer,
justice
alito,
what
you
have
is
--
it
was
a
typical
funeral,
family
members
driving
in
and--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--correct,
and
that's
where
i
was
going
to
go
with
that,
justice
alito.
the
epic
specifically
referenced
matthew
snyder
by
name,
specifically
referenced
matthew's
parents
by
name.
so
in
our
judgment,
and
the
defendants
testified
that
the
epic
sort
of
explained,
at
least
in
their
explanation,
explained
the
funeral
protest
itself.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
he
didn't
read
the
content.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
your
honor,
2
days
in
advance
they
sent
out
a
flyer
announcing
they
were
going
to
protest
the
funeral.
they
had
matthew
snyder's
picture
there.
they
claimed
they
were
going
to
protest
at
st.
john's
catholic
dog
kennel.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
he
found
out
about
the
specifics
of
the
signs--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--by
going
to
the
family
wake
immediately
following
and
seeing
it
on
the
television.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
yes,
your
honor.
right
now
the
rule
we
are
stuck
with
is
hustler
v.
falwell
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
and
the--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
the
private
targeted
nature
of
the
speech
in
our
judgment
is
what
makes
it
unprotected.
so
for
example,
the
epithets
directed
at
the
family
would
be
unprotected.
if,
for
example,
a
person
repeatedly
put
on
the
web
site
that
mr.
smith
has
aids,
whether
it's
true
or
not,
essentially
at
some
point
in
time
it
might
rise
to
the
level
of
an
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
there
would
have
to
be
other
facts
combined
there.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
correct.
i
don't
think--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
constitutional
impediment
to
bringing
--
or
the
constitution
would
not
--
would
bar
that
claim
from
going
forward.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
yes,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
under
a
certain
scenario,
you
could
have,
regardless
of
the
signs,
you
could
have
a
scenario
where
the
funeral
was
disrupted
and
it
was
disrupted
in
this
case.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
it
was,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
the
police
testified
that,
i
think
it
was,
about
8
minutes
after
the
funeral
started,
that
the
protesters
left
the
area.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
well,
according
to
i
believe
all
the
witnesses,
yes,
they
had
to
come
in--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--that,
and
they
certainly
took
away,
according
to
the
priest
that
was
coordinating
the
mass,
they
certainly
took
away
the
peaceful
experience
that
all
private
figures--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--no.
i
hope
i
said,
justice
scalia,
that
under
the
right
context,
jut
the
signs
alone,
if
that's
all
we
are
saying,
there's
a
sign
out
there
that
says
"god
hates
america",
i
don't
think
that
we
could
have
a
claim
there.
but
if
they
in
fact
disrupted
the
funeral,
i
do
think
in
some
set
of
facts
there
could
be
a
claim.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
well,
in
the
context
of
defamation
we
had
the
rosenbloom
followed
by
the
gertz
decision.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
i'd
think
there'd
be
--
have
to
be
a
lot
more
facts
involved,
harassing
type
of
facts.
the--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--public
speech,
even
directed
to
a
private
figure,
should
be
treated
differently
than
as
directed
towards
a
public
official.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
gertz
v.
welch
treated
the
public
versus
private
figure
status
different,
albeit--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--correct.
correct,
but
the
problem
is,
the
only
other
case
we
have
that
deals
with
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
from
this
court
is
hustler
v.
falwell,
and
hustler
v.
falwell
clearly
dealt
with
a
public
figure.
the
states
have
interpreted
hustler
v.
falwell
as
not
applying
to
a
private
figure.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
yes,
there
is
an
illinois
case
that
we
cited
in
the
brief
where
it
was
specifically
said
it
was
a
matter
of
public
concern,
and
they
said
the
plaintiff
was
not
a
public
figure;
therefore
the
--
just,
you
have
to
meet
the
elements
of
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
i
think
gertz
v.
welch
says
that.
dun
&
bradstreet
says
you
have
to
at
least
look
at
the
context
of
the
situation.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
particular
signs,
because
if
you
don't,
anyone
could
come
up
with
a
public
concern,
because
they
could
direct
any
type
of
epithets
at
a
person.
in
the
middle
of
their
paragraph
they
could
say:
i'm
for
taxes
or
i'm
against
taxes,
and
therefore
the
entire
statement
would
be--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--it
does,
justice
scalia,
and
i
wasn't
suggesting--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--and
i
hope
i
didn't.
what
i
meant
to
say,
if
i
didn't,
was
there
would
have
to
be
a
lot
more
facts
involved
to
rise
to
the
level
of
an
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
case
if
you
just
told
the
marine,
for
example,
you're
not
in
favor
of
the
war.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
the
--
i
think
the
standard
should
be
hustler
v.
falwell
generally
does
not
apply--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--i
thought
hustler
v.
falwell
was
intentional
infliction
of
emotional--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--i
think
the
rule
should
be
hustler
v.
falwell
generally
does
not
apply
to
a
private
figure
unless
the
defendant
can
show
some
compelling
connection
there,
and
if
you
--
if
you--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--or
at
least
reasonable,
rational
connection.
in
this
case
they
don't
even
claim
there
is
a
connection.
they
just
used
this
moment
to
hijack
someone
else's
private
event
when
they
are
grieving
over
a
20-year-old
child's
funeral.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
well
at
least
in
hustler
--
justice
kagan,
at
least
in
hustler
v.
falwell
we
had
a
traditional
area
of
public
discourse.
we
had
a
parody.
i
believe
the
opinion
went
to
great
length
to
explain
that.
here
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
private
funeral.
i
don't
--
i
would
hope
that
the
first
amendment
wasn't
enacted
to
allow
people
to
disrupt
and
harass
people
at
someone
else's
private
funeral.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
well,
the
states
have
--
in
the
statutory
case,
they
have
the
interest
of
penalizing
the
offending
party.
in
tort
law,
the
state's
interest
is
to
provide
a
remedy
for
its
citizens.
under
the
fourth
circuit's
interpretation
of
these
facts,
mr.
snyder
has
absolutely
no
remedy,
none.
he
is
a
private
figure,
a
grieving
father,
and
he
is
left
without
any
remedy
whatsoever.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
i
believe
that
the
hustler
v.
falwell
was
a
--
had
several
tort
claims,
but
there
was
no
criminal
statute
violated.
i
understand
that
it
went
the
other
way
because
of
the
public
figure
status,
but
that
would
be
an
example.
another
example--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--justice
ginsburg,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
case,
but
i
think
the
--
if
for
example
someone
sued
someone
for
defamation,
there
probably
wouldn't
be
a
statute
that
was
violated
so
i
don't
--
i
would
presume--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--other
than
hustler
v.
falwell,
i
do
not
have
any
federal
cases
to
cite
to
you.
the
state
cases
we
cited
in
our
brief--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--justice
alito,
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
be
criminally--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--i
believe
that
you
could
commit
a
tort
and
still
be
in
compliance
with
the
criminal
code,
justice
alito.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
of
course
this
court
could
do
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
yes,
justice
scalia.
but
according
to
the
fourth
circuit,
we
agree
that
the
respondents
waived
that
issue
by
not
appealing
that
issue.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
the
invasion
--
or
elements
of
the
invasion
of
privacy.
they
didn't
contest
that
we
met
the
elements
of
the
tort.
they
--
they
contested
the
constitutional
issue,
but
not
whether
or
not
we
met
the
elements
of
the
tort.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
justice
kagan,
i
say
that
is
a
--
one,
it's
a
much
closer
call,
and
two,
i
would
look
to
the
facts
of
the
case
to
see
if
the
funeral
itself
was
disrupted.
but
that
isn't
the
facts
of
our
case.
the
facts
of
our
case
was
one,
that
it
was
disrupted
and
two,
that
it's
personal,
targeted
assaults
on
mr.
snyder.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
i
would
say
that's
a
much
closer
call
and
not
the--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--it's
a
closer
call
because
it's
not
a
personal,
targeted
nature
of
the
attack
on
the
snyder
family
that
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
i
think
that,
generally
speaking,
yes,
justice
kagan.
the
court
--
the
district
court
would
have
to
look
at
the
signs,
as
the
district
court
did
in
this
case,
and
determine
which
one
he
believed
were
directed
at
the
family
and
which
ones
were
not.
there
was
a
comment
earlier
that
all
the
signs
were
presented.
well,
all
the
signs
were
presented
by
the
respondents,
not
by
mr.
snyder.
so
we--
mr.
sean
e.
summers
--correct.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
correct,
justice
scalia,
the
element
of
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
requires
outrageousness.
mr.
sean
e.
summers
again,
i
believe
that's
a
closer
call
and
i
would
say
yes,
if
it's
a
general
statement,
does
not
disrupt
the
funeral,
does
not
target
the
family,
i
would
say
that
it's
one,
a
much
closer
call,
and
yes,
it's
more
likely
that
the
constitution
is
going
to
prevent
that
claim
from
going
forward.
the
--
i'd
say--
