that's

justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
simply
points
out
that
all
of
us
in
a
pluralistic
society
have
components
to
our
identity;
we
are
republicans
or
democrats,
we
are
christians
or
atheists,
we
are
single
or
married,
we
are
old
or
young.
any
one
of
those
things
you
could
turn
into
a
public
issue
and
follow
a
particular
person
around,
making
that
person
the
target
of
your
comments;
and
in
your
view
because
this
gives
you
maximum
publicity,
the
more
innocent,
the
more
removed
the
person
is,
the
greater
the
impact
--
the
justice
alito
hypothetical
in
--
in
--
in
the
grandmother
case.
so
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
your
--
your
public
concern
issue
may
--
may
not
be
a
limiting
factor
in
cases
where
there
is
an
outrageous
conduct
and
where
there
should
be
a
tort.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
position
is
you
can
take
this
and
you
can
follow
any
citizen
around
at
any
point?
that
--
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
questions
from
justice
kagan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
justice
alito,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
--
you
should
help
us
in
finding
some
line
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
the
--
but
the
hypotheticals
point
out
that
there
can
be
an
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
action
for
certain
harassing
conduct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
torts
and
crimes
are
committed
with
words
all
the
time.
