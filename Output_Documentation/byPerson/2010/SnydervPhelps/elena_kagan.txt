justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
summers,
hustler
seems
to
me
to
have
one
sentence
that
is
key
to
the
whole
decision,
and
it
goes
like
this.
it
says:
"outrageousness
in
the
area
of
political
and
social
discourse
has
an
inherent
subjectiveness
about
it
which
would
allow
a
jury
to
impose
liability
on
the
basis
of
the
jurors'
tastes
or
views
or
perhaps
on
the
basis
of
their
dislike
of
a
particular
expression.
"
how
does
that
sentence
--
how
is
that
sentence
less
implicated,
in
a
case
about
a
private
figure
than
in
a
case
about
a
public
figure?
justice
elena
kagan
but
that
goes
back
to
the
question
that
was
asked
previously
about,
suppose
you
had
a
general
statute
that
just
said,
there
will
be
no
disruptions
of
any
kind
at
private
funerals.
you
know,
pick
your
distance,
500
feet,
1,000
feet,
but
something
that
didn't
refer
to
content,
that
didn't
refer
to
ideas,
that
just
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
people
could
not
disrupt
private
funerals.
what
harm
would
that
statute
not
address
in
your
case?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
phelps,
suppose
--
suppose
your
group
or
another
group
or
--
picks
a
wounded
soldier
and
follows
him
around,
demonstrates
at
his
home,
demonstrates
at
his
workplace,
demonstrates
at
his
church,
basically
saying
a
lot
of
the
things
that
were
on
these
signs
or
--
or
other
offensive
and
outrageous
things,
and
just
follows
this
person
around,
day-to-day.
does
that
person
not
have
a
claim
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress?
justice
elena
kagan
demonstrations
outside
the
person's
home,
outside
the
person's
workplace,
outside
the
person's
church
--
demonstrations,
not
disruptions,
but
saying
these
kinds
of
things:
you
are
a
war
criminal,
you
--
what
--
would
--
whatever
these
signs
say
or
worse?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
ms.
phelps,
let's
say
that
we
disagree
with
you
as
to
whether
mr.
snyder
had
at
all
injected
himself
into
this
controversy.
or
let's
take
a
case
where
it's
clear
that
the
father
of
the
fallen
soldier
had
not
injected
himself,
had
not
called
any
newspapers,
had
not
said
anything
to
anybody,
but
a
group
knew
that
this
funeral
was
taking
place,
and
was
there
with
the
same
signs,
with
the
same
--
are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
that
makes
the
difference?
that
there,
there
would
be
a
claim?
justice
elena
kagan
so
it's
not
a
difference
that
matters.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
summers,
could
i
ask
you
to
go
back
to
an
answer
that
you
gave
to
one
of
my
colleagues
when
you
were
last
up
there?
you
said
that
a
--
a
more
standard
antiwar
demonstration,
"get
out
of
iraq",
"war
is
immoral",
at
this
funeral,
same
distance,
same
sized
signs
--
that
a
more
standard
antiwar
demonstration
would
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
from
an
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
suit.
and
i'm
wondering
why
that
is.
if
you
think
that
what
is
--
what
causes
the
lack
of
protection
here
is
the
kind
of
glomming
to
a
private
funeral,
the
exploitation
of
a
private
person's
grief,
the
--
the
appearance
for
no
other
reason
than
to
gain
publicity
at
a
private
event
--
if
that's
the
problem,
why
doesn't
it
also
apply
to
a
standard,
you
know,
"get
out
of
iraq",
"war
is
wrong",
kind
of
demonstration?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
suppose
it
is
not
disrupted
and
suppose
--
and
i
know
you
that
this
is,
that
contest
these
facts
--
that
yours
wasn't
disrupted,
that
they
stopped
when
you
started,
that
they
were
a
sufficient
number
of
feet
away
from
the
funeral
and
so
forth.
so
we
are
just
talking
the
fact
that
there
are
people
who
have
--
who
are
appropriating
and
taking
advantage
of
a
private
funeral
in
order
to
express
their
views,
and
they
are
in
compliance
with
all
of
the
content-neutral
rules.
justice
elena
kagan
but
why
is
it
a
closer
call?
justice
elena
kagan
so
does
that
mean
that
now
we
have
to
start
reading
each
sign,
and
saying
"war
is
wrong"
falls
on
one
side
of
the
line
but
"you
are
a
war
criminal"
falls
on
another
side
of
the
line?
is
that
what
we
would
have
to
do?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
true,
but
i
was
assuming
a
situation
in
which
a
jury
found
that
the
war
was
wrong,
that
a
jury
did
find
that
outrageous;
and
the
question
was
were
we
going
to
reverse
the
jury
verdict
because
we
--
the
first
amendment
prohibited
it?
