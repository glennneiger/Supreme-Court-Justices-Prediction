justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
anything
to
suggest
that
the
maryland
legislature,
in
enacting
that
statute,
intended
to
occupy
the
field
of
regulations
of
events
that
occur
at
funerals?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that
the
epic
is
relevant
as
an
explanation
of
some
of
the
these
arguably
ambiguous
signs
that
were
displayed
at
the
funeral?
for
example,
"you
are
going
to
hell",
"god
hates
you";
who
is
"you"?
if
you
read
the
epic,
perhaps
that
sheds
light
on
who
"you"
is.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
yes,
but
the
signs
say
"you"
and
the
argument
is
made
"you"
doesn't
mean
matthew
snyder;
it
means
a
larger
group.
and
then
you
have
the
epic,
which
is
directed
directly
at
matthew
snyder.
doesn't
that
show
--
shed
light
on
what
"you"
meant
on
those
signs?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
this
the
situation
in
which
all
conduct
that
complies
with
the
maryland
funeral
protest
statute
is
lawful?
if
the
maryland
legislature
said
this
is
the
--
these
are
the
exclusive
regulations
that
apply
here,
so
that
if
someone
came
up
to
mr.
phelps
at
the
funeral
and
spat
in
his
face,
that
would
not
be
--
that
wouldn't
be
illegal?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
because
it's
not
specifically
prohibited
by
the
statute.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
your
--
is
it
your
argument
that
the
first
amendment
never
allows
a
claim
for
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
based
on
speech
unless
the
speech
is
such
that
it
can
be
proven
to
be
false
or
true?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
well,
justice
kagan
gave
you
one
example.
let
me
give
you
another
example
along
the
same
lines.
let's
say
there
is
a
grandmother
who
has
raised
a
son
who
was
killed
in
afghanistan
or
in
iraq
by
an
ied.
and
she
goes
to
visit
her
son's
--
her
grandson's
grave,
and
she's
waiting
to
take
a
bus
back
to
her
home.
and
while
she's
at
the
bus
stop,
someone
approaches
and
speaks
to
her
in
the
most
vile
terms
about
her
son:
he
was
killed
by
an
ied;
do
you
know
what
ieds
do?
let
me
describe
it
for
you,
and
i
am
so
happy
that
this
happened;
i
only
wish
i
were
there;
i
only
wish
that
i
could
have
taken
pictures
of
it.
and
on
and
on.
now,
is
that
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
there
is
no
false
statement
involved
and
it's
purely
speech.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
it's
an
elderly
person.
she's
really
probably
not
in
--
in
a
position
to
punch
this
person
in
the
nose.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
there
--
if
that
--
there
is
a
possibility
there
is
a
claim
there,
then
what
distinguishes
that
from
this
case?
now,
i
thought
you
were
beginning
to
say
that
my
hypothetical
is
different
because
mr.
snyder
made
his
son
into
a
public
figure;
and
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
in
that
connection
is
whether
every
bereaved
family
member
who
provides
information
to
a
local
newspaper
for
an
obituary
thereby
makes
the
deceased
person
a
public
figure?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
the
grandmother
called
up
the
local
paper
and
said,
let
me
tell
you
something
about
my
grandson--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--who
was
just
killed
in
iraq.
you
know,
he
liked
football
and
camping.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
makes
him
--
that
makes
her
a
public
figure?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
your
argument
depends
on
the
proposition
that
this
is
speech
on
a
matter
of
public
concern,
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
let
me
--
let
me
give
you
this
example.
suppose
someone
believes
that
african
americans
are
inferior,
they
are
inherently
inferior,
and
they
are
really
a
bad
influence
on
this
country.
and
so
a
person
comes
up
to
an
african-american
and
starts
berating
that
person
with
racial
hatred.
now
is
that
in
--
this
is
just
any
old
person
on
--
any
old
african-american
on
the
street.
that's
a
matter
of
public
concern?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
aren't
the
members
of
the
family
--
why
aren't
the
members
of
the
family
of
the
deceased
a
captive
audience
at
the
funeral?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
the
targeted
picketing
of
a
person's
house
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
picketing
around
the
site
of
the
funeral?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
it
doesn't
have
to
do
with
whether
this
is
a
--
what
you
characterize
as
a
public
funeral
as
opposed
to
a
private
funeral?
that
is
not
the
distinction
you
are
relying
upon
any
longer?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
a
parent
is
called
after
the
--
puts
in
the
obituary
information
and
called
by
the
local
newspaper
and
asked
for
a
comment,
and
he
says
or
she
says,
i'm
proud
of
my
son
because
he
died
in
the
service
of
our
country.
does
that
--
is
he
stepping
into
a
public
debate
by
doing
that?
