justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--were
they
encouraged--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
i'm
trying
to
tease
out
the
importance
of
the
--
whether
the
person's
a
private
--
or
public
figure
--
a
private
person
or
a
public
figure.
does
it
make
a
difference
if
i
am
directing
public
comments
to
a
public
or
private
figure?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i'm
talking
about
in
terms
of
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
if
i
am
talking
to
you
as
a
marine,
if
you
were
a
marine,
and
i
was
talking
about
the
iran
war
and
saying
that
you
are
perpetuating
the
horrors
that
america's
doing
and
said
other
things
that
were
offensive,
would
you
have
a
cause
of
action
because
you
are
being
called
a
perpetrator
of
the
american
experience?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
are
saying
yes.
so
public
speech,
speech
on
a
public
matter,
if
directed
to
a
private
person,
should
be
treated
differently
under
the
law?
i
think
that
was
part
of
what
justice
breyer
was
asking.
is
that
what
your
position
is?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
and
under
what
theory
of
the
first
amendment
would
we
do
that?
what
case
would
stand
for,
our
case,
stand
for
the
proposition
that
public
speech
or
speech
on
a
public
matter
should
be
treated
differently
depending
on
the
recipient
of
the
speech?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
was
defamation.
that's
false
--
truth
or
falsity.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
have
they
done
it
in
the
context
of
differentiating
between
public
and
private
speech?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
was
not
talking
about
state
cases.
i
was
talking
about
a
supreme
court
case
that
suggested
that
we
would
treat
--
we
would
treat
the
first
amendment
and
the
right
to
--
to
speak
on
public
matters
differently,
depending
on
the
person
to
whom
it
was
directed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
goes
--
it
goes
to
the
context.
now,
going
to
the
context
of
this
speech,
do
we
look
at
the
words
on
a
sign
alone
or
do
we
look
at
the
entire
context
of
what
all
of
the
other
signs
said
at
the
demonstration,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
speech
here
was
public
or
private
speech?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
in
that
case--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
am
following
your
argument
that
the
bulk
of
your
speech
in
the
epic,
and
even
the
bulk
of
your
signs,
involve
public
speech.
what
you
have
not
explained
to
me
is
how
your
speech
directed
at
the
snyders
constituted
public
speech,
or
speech
about
a
public
matter.
because
you
are
talking
about
them
raising
matthew
for
the
devil,
teaching
him
to,
i
think,
defy
the
creator,
to
divorce
and
commit
adultery.
at
what
point
and
how
do
we
take
personal
attacks
and
permit
those,
as
opposed
to
--
i
fully
accept
you're
entitled
in
some
circumstances
to
speak
about
any
political
issue
you
want.
but
what's
the
line
between
doing
that
and
then
personalizing
it
and
creating
hardship
to
an
individual?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
we
disagree
that
that
made
him
a
public
figure,
if
we
view
him
as
a
private
figure,
is
that
enough
to
defeat
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assume
that
the
matthews
are
private
figures
and
you
did
this.
so
explain
to
me
how
you
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
want
to
change
my
assumption.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
assume
that
he
is
a
private
figure.
you
have
now
made
a
public
statement
and
directed
personal
comments
at
an
individual
who
is
a
private
figure.
is
that
actionable?
