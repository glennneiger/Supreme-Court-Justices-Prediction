justice
antonin
scalia
are
we
just
talking
about
a
funeral?
that's
one
of
the
problems
i
have
with
the
case.
there
was
also
this
video
that
your
client
watched,
right,
later,
after
the
funeral.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
well,
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
funeral?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine,
but
it
--
it
does
not
intrude
upon
the
funeral.
i
mean,
no.
you
either
have
two
separate
causes
of
action
--
one
is
the
intrusion
upon
the
funeral
and
the
other
is
the
harm
caused
by
viewing
this
posting
on
the
internet
--
but
i
don't
see
how
they
both
relate
to
intrusion
upon
the
funeral.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
were
just
submitted
to
the
jury
as
one
big
lump,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
there
hadn't
been
a
funeral
protest,
just
the
epic.
would
that
have
supported
the
cause
of
action
you
assert
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
or
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it's
--
he
doesn't
have
to
watch
them?
they
are
just
posted
on
the
internet.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
his
choice
to
watch
them,
but
if
he
chooses
to
watch
them
he
has
a
cause
of
action
because
it
causes
him
distress.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
statute
applies
to
any
protest
at
funerals:
protesting
the
vietnam
war,
protesting
whatever.
your
case
involves,
at
least
if
we
accept
your
version
of
it,
a
protest
of
the
dead
soldier
who
--
who
is
going
to
hell
and
whose
parents
have
raised
him
to
go
to
hell.
so
simply
to
say
you
can
have
a
protest
within
a
certain
distance
is
not
to
say
you
can
have
a
protest
within
a
certain
distance
that
defames
the
corpse.
that's
a
different
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
intrusion
upon
the
privacy
of
the
funeral
is
out
of
the
case
then,
right,
because
that
sign
would
intrude
upon
the
privacy
of
thea
funeral
just
as
much?
that's
not
really
what
you
are
complaining
about.
you
are
complaining
about
the
personal
attacks,
aren't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
they
had
to
come
in
a
different
entrance?
is
that
the
extent
of
the
disruption?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
order
to
avoid
the
protest.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
wouldn't
have
objected
to
that
if
there
weren't
these
nasty
signs,
you
just
said,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
summers,
i'm
a
little
concerned
at
your
apparent
acceptance
of
--
of
the
proposition
that
if
one
comes
up
to
a
marine
and
says,
you
are
contributing
to
a
--
a
terribly
unfair
war,
that
that
alone
would
--
would
form
the
basis
for
the
--
the
tort
of
intentional
infliction
of
an
emotional
distress.
what
--
what
are
the
requirements
for
that?
i
thought
that
it
had
to
be
outrageous
conduct.
doesn't
it
have
to
be
outrageous
conduct?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean
--
i
mean,
why
accept
that
as
--
as
parallel
to
what
--
to
what
you
are
claiming
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
summers,
can
i
ask
you:
suppose
i
don't
think
you
have
a
cause
of
action
for
invasion
of
privacy
when
these
people
were
at
this
distance
from
the
funeral.
but
that
was
one
of
the
causes
of
action
submitted
to
the
jury.
if
i
disagree
with
you
on
that
cause
of
action,
i
suppose
i
would
have
to
say
there
has
to
be
a
retrial
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
support
both
causes
of
action
here,
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
and
the
invasion
of
privacy,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
waived
what
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
all
right.
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
goodness.
we
did
have
a
doctrine
of
fighting
words,
and
you
acknowledge
that
if
somebody
said,
you
know,
things
such
as
that
to
his
face,
that
wouldn't
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
unprotected.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
so?
do
we
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
that?
is
it
the
criterion
of
the
fighting
words
exception
to
the
first
amendment
that
there
be
an
actual
fight?
certainly
not
that.
is
it
a
requirement
that
there
be
a
potential
for
a
fight?
i
doubt
it.
where
--
where
do
you
get
the
notion
that
it
has
--
that
there
has
to
be
an
imminent
fight?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
say
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
person
was
too
remote?
the
fight
was
not
--
was
not
imminent?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
she's
a
quaker,
too.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
everybody--
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let's
talk
about
subjectively.
you're
concerned
about
--
surely
fighting
words
is
--
you
know,
whether
something
is
a
fighting
word,
that
is
a
very
subjective
call,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
it's
subjective?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that's
solid,
absolutely,
what's
a
fighting
word,
whereas
what
is
an
outrageous
statement
is
very
much
different
from
what's
a
fighting
word?
i
don't
see
the
difference.
besides
which,
isn't
it
the
case
that
in
order
to
recover
for
the
tort
of
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
injury,
you
have
to
substantiate
the
injury
with
some
physical
manifestation,
which
the
plaintiff
here
had?
and
my
goodness,
for
fighting
words,
you
don't
even
need
that.
you
can
just
say,
these
words
angered
me
to
the
degree
that
i
would
have
been
inclined
to
fight.
at
least
for
this
tort,
you
have
to
have
physical
manifestations.
why
isn't
that
a
very
objective
standard?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
point
depends
--
depends
upon
the
proposition
that
what
is
outrageous
is
more
subjective
than
what
is
fighting
words?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
that
that
kind
of
a
call
is
always
necessary
under
--
under
the
tort
that
you're
--
that
you're
relying
upon.
the
conduct
has
to
be
outrageous,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
always
requires
that
kind
of
a
call,
unless
the
tort
is
unconstitutional,
as
applied
to
all
--
all
harm
inflicted
by
words.
