justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
does
he
have
a
claim?
as
i
understand
it,
after
this
case
arose
maryland
passed
a
statute
putting
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions.
i
read
that
statute
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
was
nothing
unlawful,
nothing
out
of
compliance
with
that
statute,
that
was
done
here.
it
was
at
considerable
distance.
there
was
no
importuning
anyone
going
to
the
funeral.
it
stopped
before
the
funeral,
the
service,
began.
am
i
right
that
under
the
current
statute
this
conduct
was
not
unlawful?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
they
stand
where
the
police
told
them
to?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
was
there
with
the
knowledge
of
the
police
and
with
the
permission
of
the
police.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
didn't
prohibit
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
this
the
case
which
the
facts
here
meet.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
knew
just
what
was
going
on,
do
you
suppose
--
because
this
had
been
done
before.
in
fact,
wasn't
this
the
very
same
day
they
picketed
at
annapolis
and
at
the
state
capitol.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
they
knew
what
the
signs
were
going
to
be.
could
they
have
gotten
an
injunction,
do
you
suppose,
against
this
protest?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
could
go
into
court
and
say
that
the
signs
were
this,
that
or
the
other
things
at
the
state
capitol,
the
same
signs
at
annapolis;
they're
going
to
use
the
same
signs
at
this
protest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
they
have
the
"going
to
hell"
sign
at
the
state
capitol
and
annapolis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
those
particular
ones
that
you
mention,
did
they
have
those
at
the
other
two?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
sounds
like
to
you
it's
the
whole
society,
the
whole
rotten
society
in
their
view.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
--
you
said
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
those
signs
targeted
the
family
rather
than
the
whole
u.s.
society?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
claim
is
that
hustler
was
a
--
falwell
was
a
public
figure
and
the
snyder
family
is
not.
so
i
think
what
i
got
from
your
brief
is
you
don't
fall
under
that
case
because
you
are
not
dealing
with
a
public
figure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
or
it
wasn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
when
the
service
itself
began
the
protesters
stopped.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
defamation,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
have
other
instances
where
conduct
is
lawful,
meets
all
the
terms
of
the
statute
that's
meant
to
govern
protests
at
funerals,
and
yet
there
is
an
award
of
damages
permitted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
was
a
--
i'm
not
asking
you
for
an
example
where
--
a
federal
case
where
the
conduct
was
permitted
by
the
statute,
by
the
policemen
there,
and
yet
there
was
--
was
a
damage
award.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
talking
about
this
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
claim
that
you're
bringing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
because
of
the
distance.
i
mean,
you
would
have
to
be
a
lot
closer
than
the
maryland
statute
allows
to
spit
in
someone's
face.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
phelps,
there
is
no
question
that
these
signs
and
the
signs
like
that
we
saw
during
the
vietnam
war.
but
you
had
the
demonstration
at
the
capitol,
and
you
had
the
demonstration
at
annapolis.
this
is
a
case
about
exploiting
a
private
family's
grief
and
the
question
is:
why
should
the
first
amendment
tolerate
exploiting
this
marine's
family
when
you
have
so
many
other
forums
for
getting
--
getting
across
your
message,
the
very
same
day
you
did?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
gave
the
answer
before
about
--
you
said
stalking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
this
comparable
to
stalking?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
has
made
that
a
very
narrow
category,
hasn't
it?
i
mean,
we
have
not
allowed
the
fighting
words
--
you
say
that
to
me
and
i'm
immediately
going
to
punch
you
in
the
nose,
because
it
is
an
instinctive
reaction.
i
think
the
court
has
rejected
spreading
fighting
words
beyond
that.
