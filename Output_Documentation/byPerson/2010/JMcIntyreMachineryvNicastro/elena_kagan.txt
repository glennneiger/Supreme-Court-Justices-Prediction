justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fergenson,
in
your
question
presented
to
this
court,
you
asked
whether
there's
personal
jurisdiction
--
and
i'm
quoting
here
--
"solely
because
the
manufacturer
targets
the
united
states
market
for
the
sale
of
its
product.
"
so
i'm
taking
from
that,
that
you
acknowledge
that
this
manufacturer,
mcintyre,
a
british
manufacturer,
targeted
the
united
states
market
for
the
sale
of
its
product.
that's
correct,
yes?
justice
elena
kagan
that's
your
question
presented--
justice
elena
kagan
--did
this
--
well,
i'll
just
ask
you,
then:
did
this
manufacturer
target
the
united
states
market?
did
it
want
to
sell
its
products
in
the
united
states?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
so
what
does
that
mean,
exactly,
mr.
fergenson?
because
the
united
states
is
the
united
states.
it's
made
up
of
50
states.
so
i
assume
that
what
that
means
is
the
manufacturer
wanted
to
sell
its
products
in
each
of
the
50
states.
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
it
only
wanted
to
sell
its
product
in
a
few
states?
justice
elena
kagan
right,
anywhere.
so
if
the
distributor
came
up
with
california,
that
was
great.
if
the
distributor
came
up
with
a
customer
in
new
jersey,
that
was
great.
as
many
as
possible,
more
the
better,
all
over
the
united
states.
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
exactly.
so
you
targeted
new
jersey
no
less
than
you
targeted
california
or
new
york
or
illinois
or
massachusetts
or
anything
else.
justice
elena
kagan
you
targeted
the
entire
united
states?
why
shouldn't
there
be
jurisdiction
in
each
of
the
states
you
targeted?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
suable
in
any
state
where
the
incident
arises.
this
is
not
general
jurisdiction.
this
is
specific
jurisdiction.
so
the
question
is,
when
you
target
the
entire
united
states
and
each
of
the
50
states
within
that
and
an
accident
occurs
within
one
of
those
states,
are
you
subject
to
jurisdiction
in
that
state
for
that
accident,
for
a
claim
based
on
that
accident?
not
generally,
but
just
for
a
claim
based
on
that
accident.
didn't
even
justice
o'connor
--
you
referenced
the
asahi
opinions,
but
justice
o'connor
said
as
long
as
there's
purposeful
availment,
there
is
specific
jurisdiction,
and
there
is
purposeful
availment
when
there's
an
active
effort
to
target
a
market.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fergenson,
just
picking
up
where
justice
ginsburg
left
off,
ohio
is
a
perfectly
good
place
for
jurisdiction
over
a
claim
between
the
british
manufacturer
and
its
distributor
in
ohio.
any
kind
of
contract
claim,
a
claim
based
on
the
agreement
between
the
two,
ohio
is
the
appropriate
place
for
jurisdiction.
but
ohio
does
not
seem
the
appropriate
place
for
jurisdiction
--
and
again,
we're
talking
about
specific
jurisdiction,
not
general
--
as
to
a
claim
based
on
an
accident
that
occurred
in
new
jersey.
the
entire
idea
of
specific
jurisdiction
is
that
you
need
a
relationship
between
the
defendant
and
the
forum
and
the
claim,
and
here
the
claim
arose
in
new
jersey
and
was
in
fact
not
related
to
ohio.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fergenson,
could
i
try
another
hypothetical?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
fergenson,
the
question
is
whether
seeking
to
serve
a
market
--
and
here
you're
seeking
to
serve
a
market
in
each
of
the
50
states
--
is
purposeful
availment.
so
let
me
just
try
a
different
hypothetical.
suppose
you
had
the
same
arrangement
with
your
distributor
in
ohio,
but
the
arrangement
was
not
to
serve
the
entire
united
states
market.
instead,
the
arrangement
was
to
serve
only
five
states
in
the
midwest.
that's
what
you
wanted,
your
client
wanted,
the
market
to
be.
so
it
was
going
to
be
ohio
and
indiana
and
illinois
and
michigan
and
iowa,
all
right?
so
now
a
machine
blows
up
in
illinois.
is
there
jurisdiction
in
illinois?
justice
elena
kagan
there
is
jurisdiction
in
illinois,
even
though
your
relationship
with
your
distributor
was
in
ohio.
but
there's
jurisdiction
in
illinois
because
the
machine
blew
up
there
and
you
were
seeking
to
serve
the
market;
that's
right?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
now
we
have
--
now
we
say
this
is
working
very
well.
let's
get
another
nine
distributors
on
board.
we'll
give
each
of
them
five
states,
all
right?
now,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
now
you're
liable
all
over
the
united
states
because
you've
had
this
relationship
with
ten
different
distributors,
each
of
whom
are
going
to
serve
five
states.
so
there's
personal
jurisdiction
in
any
state
where
a
machine
blows
up.
justice
elena
kagan
and
now
i
say:
let's
forget
these
ten
distributors.
who
needs
ten
distributors?
i'll
just
have
one
distributor.
why
is
there
any
difference?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fergenson,
with
respect,
this
distributor
was
told
to
sell
as
many
products
as
it
could
in
as
many
states
as
it
could.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
ross,
do
you
think
if
there's
a
small
business
in
the
united
states
that
sells
a
product
and
that
actively
seeks
to
serve
a
foreign
market,
maybe
it's
great
britain,
maybe
it's
china,
and
that
product
blows
up
in
that
foreign
country
--
great
britain,
china
--
do
you
think
that
the
manufacturer,
the
american
manufacturer
is
subject
to
jurisdiction
there?
justice
elena
kagan
all
--
all
over
the
world
this
is
true;
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
ross,
we
do
that
now;
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
and
mr.
ross,
isn't
the
point
that
he
was
selling
by
using
large
convention
sites
in
the
united
states,
expecting
that
people
from
other
--
would
show
up
to
those
large
convention
sites?
i
know
that
justice
alito
doesn't
want
to
hear
this,
but
new
jersey
doesn't
have
all
that
many
large
convention
sites
like
las
vegas
does.
newark
is
not
such
a
hot
place,
but
they're
expecting
people
from
newark
to
go
and
look
at
these
machines
and
buy
these
machines.
that's
the
marketing
system
that's
used
for
these
massive
machines
that
they're
trying
to
sell
nationwide.
justice
elena
kagan
and
mr.
fergenson,
isn't
that
what
justice
o'connor
said
in
asahi,
that
the
component
manufacturer
may
have
all
the
knowledge
in
the
world
--
for
justice
brennan,
that
was
enough;
for
justice
o'connor,
it
was
not
enough
that
knowledge
was
insufficient,
that
there
had
to
be
purposeful
availment,
that
there
had
to
be
an
active
decision,
a
choice
to
seek
the
market.
and
--
and
i
understand
that,
on
your
view,
mcintyre
made
that
choice.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fergenson,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fergenson,
toyota,
honda,
volkswagen
--
pick
your
car
company
--
sells
many
millions
of
cars
to
the
united
states.
they
start
flowing
up
here,
they
operate
through
independent
distributors
only.
can
they
be
subject
to
jurisdiction
in
any
of
the
states?
