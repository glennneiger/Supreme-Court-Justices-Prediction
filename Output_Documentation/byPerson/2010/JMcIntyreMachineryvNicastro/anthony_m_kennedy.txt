justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
--
i
don't
want
to
make
your
argument
for
you,
but
it
seems
to
me
all
of
a
sudden
you're
talking
about
how
ohio
law
will
help
you
out.
i
thought
the
question
was,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
defendant
at
least,
whether
the
defendant
purposely
availed
itself
of
the
forum
and
you
would
say
the
defendant
here
purposely
availed
itself
of
ohio
by
choosing
an
ohio
distributor.
but
you
don't
make
that
argument.
you're
talking
about
a
contract,
an
indemnity,
which
seems
to
me
another
step.
that's
a
choice
of
law
and
applicable
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if,
hypothetically,
since
we're
engaging
in
a
hypothetical,
the
distributor
were
in
france,
machine
manufactured
in
england,
distributor
is
in
france,
and
the
distributor
then
selects
the
united
states
and
then
the
same
facts,
new
jersey?
united
states
would
be
an
appropriate
jurisdiction
under
the
due
process
clause,
but
not
new
jersey?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assuming
the
statute
that
justice
scalia
hypothesizes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
little
odd
that
the
states,
which
have
residual
sovereignty,
which
are
not
limited
sovereigns,
would
not
have
jurisdiction,
but
the
united
states,
which
is
a
limited
sovereignty
other
than
in
the
foreign
affairs
area,
which
may
be
relevant
here,
does
have
jurisdiction.
that
seems
backwards.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
question
is
why
the
state
can't
make
the
same
choice
that
the
congress
does.
the
state
lacks
foreign
affairs
power,
to
be
sure.
is
that
the
only
distinction?
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
due
process.
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
source
of
authority,
not
fairness
to
the
defendant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
your
argument
depend
on
whether
the
manufacturer
is
the
manufacturer
of
the
whole
machine
as
opposed
to
a
component
part,
like
asahi?
suppose
there
was
a
little
battery
or
lever
that
was
manufactured,
i
don't
know,
in
france,
and
it
was
sent
over
to
this
english
manufacturer,
and
they
were
--
this
part
is
incorporated
in
many
different
kinds
of
machines,
but
the
part
then
--
and
then
the
facts
are
the
same:
it
goes
to
the
ohio
distributor
and
new
jersey,
but
the
part
is
what
causes
the
injury.
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
like
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
he
wants
to
sell
to
the
entire
universe
if
he
can.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
you
were
cut
off
before
you
finished
your
answer,
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understood
it.
i
--
i
make
the
inference
that
you
--
you
would
say
that
if
there
is
an
advertisement,
not
a
sale,
just
an
advertisement
on
the
internet,
replacing
the
trade
show,
that
that
is
a
significant
availment
--
a
purposeful
availment,
and
there
can
be
jurisdiction
in
new
jersey.
same
factors
here,
somebody
doesn't
go
to
the
u.s.
trade
shows
but
he
does
put
it
on
the
internet,
same
result.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
to
know
what
your
position
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
was
the
sale
here
negotiated
in
--
or
part
of
the
sale
negotiated
in
nevada
or
the
person
just
--
the
new
jersey
manufacturer
just
was
interested
in
the
machine
and
then
later
contacted
the
ohio
distributor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
--
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
relate
what
happened
here
to
the
internet
hypothetical.
i
have
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--internet
hypothetical
where
there's
just
an
advertisement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
at
first
i
thought
you
were
saying
that's
sufficient.
now
you're
say,
no,
because
they
have
to
be
part
of
the
contract.
i'm
trying
to
make
the
internet
equivalent
to
the
trade
show.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
just
an
advertisement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
that's
the
cause
for
the
buyer's
interest
in
it
and
he
pursues
--
pursues
his
--
his
transaction
after
finding
out
all
the
information
on
the
internet
from
an
ohio
distributor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
arises
from
a
products
liability
suit
filed
in
a
new
jersey
state
court.
robert
nicastro
seriously
injured
his
hand
while
using
a
metal
shearing
device,
a
machine
that
was
manufactured
by
j.
mcintyre
machinery.
the
accident
occurred
in
new
jersey,
but
the
machine
was
made
in
england
and
england
is
where
j.
mcintyre
is
incorporated
and
that's
where
it
operates.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
new
jersey
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
j.
mcintyre,
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
company
at
no
time
either
marketed
goods
in
the
state
or
shipped
from
there.
of
course,
nicastro
was
the
plaintiff
in
the
new
jersey
trial
court
and
is
the
respondent
here.
mcintyre
was
the
defendant
and
is
now
the
petitioner
here.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
held
that
its
states
courts
--
its
state
courts
could
exercise
jurisdiction
over
petitioner
mcintyre.
it
held
that
the
company
knew
or
recently
should
have
known
that
its
products
were
distributed
through
a
nationwide
distribution
system
that
might
lead
to
those
products
being
sold
in
any
of
the
50
states.
six
members
of
the
court
agree
that
this
judgment
must
be
reversed.
i've
written
a
plurality
opinion
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
thomas.
that
opinion
explains
that,
at
least
in
products
liability
cases,
the
sovereign's
exercise
of
judicial
power
requires
some
act
by
which
the
defendant
purposely
avails
itself
of
the
privilege
of
conducting
activities
within
the
foreign
state,
thus
invoking
the
benefits
and
the
protection
of
its
laws.
this
court's
decision
in
an
earlier
case,
a
case
called
“asahi”
may
impart
be
responsible
for
the
new
jersey's
supreme
court's
contrary
conclusion
that
the
mere
placement
of
goods
in
the
stream
of
commerce
can
substitute
for
purposeful
availment.
although,
this
court
invoke
the
stream
of
commerce
metaphor
in
asahi,
it
should
be
clear
that
there
is
no
special
rule
of
personal
jurisdiction
for
products-liability
cases.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
--
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
joined
by
justice
alito.
he
argues
that
none
of
this
court's
precedence
would
support
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant
by
petitioner
who
had
only
a
single
sale
in
the
state
as
occurred
here.
because
the
incident
at
issue
in
this
case
does
not
invocate
modern
concerns,
the
concurring
opinion
would
avoid
using
this
case
as
an
opportunity
to
make
broad
pronouncements
on
basic
jurisdictional
rules.
the
petitioner
is,
thus,
entitled
to
a
dismissal
of
the
suit
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
the
contrary
judgment
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
is
reversed.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
sotomayor
and
kegan
joined.
