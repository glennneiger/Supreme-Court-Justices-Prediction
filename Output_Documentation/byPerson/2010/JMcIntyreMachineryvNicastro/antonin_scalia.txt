justice

when
you
say
"its
distributor",
was
this
distributor
at
all
controlled
by
the
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
be
better
to
refer
to
it
as
the
company
that
distributed
its
product,
rather
than
calling
it
"its
distributor".
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
loaded,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fergenson,
i
suppose
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
any
united
states
manufacturer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
would
desire
to
sell
his
product
in
any
of
the
states
that
would
buy
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
to
say
that
this
foreign
manufacturer
is
therefore
suable
in
any
state
would
mean
that
any
american
manufacturer
is
suable
in
any
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
none
of
our
cases
hold--
justice
antonin
scalia
--also,
i
don't
think
it's
worth
your
time,
because
frankly
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference
to
me
whether
they
can
sue
in
ohio
or
not.
you
really
think
that
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
in
the
united
states?
would
the
united
states
have
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
united
states
would
not?
they
surely
targeted
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
but
if
the
national
sovereign,
the
united
states,
provided
by
statute
that
federal
district
courts
would
have
jurisdiction
over
any,
any
tort
suit
by
a
person
injured
by
a
foreign
manufacturer
that
targeted
the
united
states,
would
that
be
proper?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
it's
a
hypothetical.
justice
antonin
scalia
hypotheticals
are
always
speculation.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
speculate
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
congress
has
power
to
control
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts,
and
congress
says
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
this
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
a
manufacturer
tells
a
distributor,
you
have
international
distribution
authority,
you
can
sell
my
machine
anywhere
in
the
world,
sell
as
many
as
you
can
anywhere
in
the
world;
that
would
include
the
united
states,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore
it
would
include
new
jersey?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know;
it's
a
hypothetical.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
include
new
jersey.
justice
antonin
scalia
purposeful
availment
of
the
government
of
new
jersey?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
availment
doesn't
mean
much
if
that's
all
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
tell
somebody
distribute
in
the
world
and
you
are
availing
yourself
of
the
government
of
new
jersey?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
and
i
assume
that
if
we
do
this
to
a
company
in
england,
any
country
in
the
world,
and
we
say
that
this
satisfies
due
process,
we
would
have
to
honor
a
judgment
from
bangladesh
based
upon
--
against
an
american
company,
based
upon
a
similarly
modest
degree
of
--
of
availment,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
--
just
as
modest
as
what
you
propose
here,
or
as
extensive.
i
don't
mean
to
demean
the
degree
of
it
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
same
kind
of
contact
in
india,
which
has
different
--
different
states
in
india.
and
--
strike
bangladesh.
make
it
madras,
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
would
have
to
honor
a
judgment
by
a
court
of
madras
against
an
american
manufacturer
who
had
as
little
contact
with
madras
as
exists
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
would
have
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true
when
there
is
a
proper
jurisdictional
basis,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
here:
what
does
the
united
states
mean
when
it
says
there
is
a
proper
jurisdictional
basis?
is
all
that
the
court
in
madras
needs
what
existed
here
in
order
to
hold
an
--
an
american
manufacturer
liable?
that's
--
that's
a
little
scary.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
interact
with
somebody
from
new
jersey,
you
have
committed
availment
of
the
government
of
new
jersey?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
a
lot
of
people
from
new
jersey.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
tell
them
to
just
seek
out
a
person
from
new
jersey.
he
told
them
to
talk
to
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
company
in
nottingham
only
sells
to
the
united
states,
that's
the
only
place
its
machines
are
--
are
marketed?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
the
component
manufacturer
would
be
liable
in
new
jersey?
