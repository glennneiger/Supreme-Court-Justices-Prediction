justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
can
i
ask
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
first,
the
word
"distributor"
hurts,
so
i'm
going
to
take
that
out,
and
i
imagine
a
hypothetical
--
i
know
your
case
differs
from
that,
but
i'm
going
to
ask
them
how
it
differs,
not
you,
okay?
now,
a
person
walks
into
a
shop
in
either
west
virginia
or
the
country
of
india
where
they
make
pots.
they're
very
nice
pots
made
actually
in
west
virginia.
and
the
potter
makes
several
thousand
a
year,
and
this
individual
says:
mr.
potter,
i
want
to
sell
your
pots;
send
me
a
thousand
each
year.
where
are
you
going
to
sell
them?
everywhere.
great.
okay?
that's
it.
now,
suppose
that
the
law
were,
as
it
could
be
perhaps,
that
it
is
sufficient
for
jurisdiction
throughout
the
united
states
that
the
distributor
or
independent
buyer
said:
good,
i'm
selling
them
everywhere
i
can
and
two
or
three
end
up
in
new
mexico,
but
it
doesn't
matter
where
they
end
up.
suppose
that
was
sufficient
to
find
jurisdiction.
you've
prepared
for
this
case.
i
want
to
know
in
your
opinion,
if
that
were
the
rule,
that's
all
that's
necessary,
what
cases
in
this
court
in
your
opinion
would
that
conflict
with?
i
mean,
i'm
thinking
of
the
facts.
i'm
not
thinking
of
statements
of
law
or
whatever,
but
you
can
bring
those
in,
too.
i
want
to
write
those
down
because
i
want
to
read
those
cases
and
you
know
them
better
than
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
what
a
convenience
test
is.
assume
i'm
very
ignorant,
which
isn't
too
far
from
the
truth.
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me,
are
there
any
cases
which
we
would
actually
be
conflicting
with
were
we
to
say
all
that's
necessary
to
assert
jurisdiction
in
every
state
is
that
a
buyer
walks
into
a
shop
where
the
manufacturer
of
pots
makes
pots
and
tells
the
potter,
i'm
going
to
sell
everywhere
i
can,
and
the
potter
says
good,
okay.
now
--
and
he
buys
the
pots.
now,
if
that
were
the
rule,
can
you
find
a
case
that
that
actually
conflicts
with?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
asahi,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
additional
conduct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i
have
written
down
in
my
notes,
which
you
can
add
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
there
are
three
things
that
happened.
one
--
it's
the
equivalent
of
the
potter.
one
thing
that
happened,
we
have
to
take
it
as,
i
think,
an
independent
company,
whether
you
want
to
call
them
a
distributor
or
not.
i
didn't
see
a
difference
there.
an
independent
company
goes
to
a
firm
somewhere
in
the
world
and
says:
i
will
buy
your
product
and
sell
it
in
the
united
states.
and
the
guy
says
good.
and
that's
true
whether
it's
a
woman's
cooperative
in
southern
india
or
whether
it's
the
biggest
company
in
the
world,
okay?
that's
the
first
thing.
the
second
thing
is
that
an
executive
of
that
company
went
to
seven
trade
shows
in
the
united
states.
and
the
third
thing
is
that
two,
three,
or
four
machines
ended
up
in
new
jersey.
now,
is
there
anything
other
than
that?
and
there's
a
lot
of
rhetoric,
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
characterizations,
but
when
i
look
for
facts,
i
found
those
three,
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
them
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
do.
now,
then
my
question
following
from
that,
if
i
have
those
are
the
three
facts,
what
worries
me
is
the
exact
opposite
of
what
the
new
--
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
said.
it
said
in
worldwide
markets
this
is
a
good
thing.
i
think
i
worry
about
it,
because
i'm
worried
about
the
woman's
cooperative
in
india,
i'm
worried
about
the
chinese
development,
i'm
worried
about
development
everywhere.
we
have
a
lot
of
small
businesses.
and
i
would
worry
--
now,
maybe
the
worry
is
legally
irrelevant
--
but
i'd
worry
about
a
rule
of
law
that
subjects
every
small
business
in
every
developing
company
--
in
every
developing
country
to
have
to
be
aware
of
the
law
in
50
states
simply
because
they
agreed
to
sell
to
an
independent
company
who
is
going
to
sell
to
america,
plus
your
two
factors.
and
really
the
third
is
none,
because
if
it
hadn't
ended
up
somewhere,
there
would
have
been
no
accident.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
my
basic
concern
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay,
but
you
see
what
my
--
my
problem
is
a
sort
of
policy
problem
that
may
be
irrelevant;
but
i
--
i
don't
see
how
the
world's
going
to
work
or
develop
if
in
fact
every
small
business
everywhere
in
the
world
has
to
know,
you
know,
the
law
of
every
50
states
and
hire
lawyers
and
come
here,
rather
than
making
the
accident
victim
go
there.
now,
it's
tough
on
the
accident
victim,
but
the
other
is
also
tough.
so
--
so
--
so
that's
--
that's
sort
of
the
--
i'm
sketching
out
my
concerns
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
trade
shows.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
the
same
as
the
first;
that's
the
sale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
do?
so
if
someone
goes
into
a
shop
in
west
virginia
and
buys
1,000
pots
and
says
i'm
going
to
sell
them
in
madras,
or
i
might
sell
them
anywhere
in
the
world--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
then
that
manufacturer,
that
potter
in
west
virginia,
now
has
to
go
to
wherever
he
ends
up
--
wherever
that
pot
ends
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
turn
it
on
that?
we
turn
it
on
whether
the
independent
buyer
--
the
independent
buyer
walked
into
the
shop
or
whether
the
seller
found
that
there
was
an
independent
buyer,
is
that
what
this
case
should
turn
on?
i
mean,
i'm
nervous.
i
see
a
lot
of
rather
deep
issues
here,
and
i
--
that's
what
are
making
me
nervous.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
--
you've
thought
about
it
more
than
i.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
what
i'm
thinking
is
this
area
of
law
has
treated
states
as
if
they're
foreign
countries,
in
a
certain
way
analogous
to.
if
that
--
i'm
trying
to
--
let
me
ask:
what
you
said
at
one
point,
that
if
an
independent
company
comes
to
a
business,
however
small,
in
the
united
states
and
says,
give
us
some
of
your
product,
we're
going
to
sell
it
everywhere
in
the
world
we
can,
fine.
and
they
do.
a
couple
get
into
some
very
--
burma
or
whatever,
myanmar.
and
right
now,
it's
the
law
that
consumers
in
all
those
countries
sue
in
that
country
if
they're
hurt.
is
that
really
the
law?
is
there
something
you
can
cite
me
to
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
it
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we're
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
are
we
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
refer
to
that?
do
you
have
the
citation
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
in
your
brief?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
today,
is
there
any
difference
between
the
trade
show,
and
he
did
show
up
at
seven
trade
shows,
i
--
i
mean
the
manufacturer
here
had
a
representative
at
several
trade
shows,
you're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
twenty
--
no,
well,
the
record
said
seven.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
all
right.
is
there
a
difference
between
that
you
think
and
--
i
just
read
in
the
paper
i
think
there
are
some
ethiopian
or
some
foreign
countries,
very
poor
country,
and
they
are
selling
goats,
and
they're
sending
some
to
the
united
states
for
some
kind
of
festival
purpose
or
something.
now,
he
said
i
have
a
site
on
the
internet.
now,
all
of
these
people,
however
small,
i
mean,
many,
many
will
have
internet
sites,
and
some
of
them
might
have
an
internet
site
that's
accessed
by
american
buyers,
as
this
man
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
is
there
any
difference
between
that
and
your
trade
shows?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
don't
use
the
characterization.
i
mean,
i'm
--
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
does
this
count
as
purposely
availed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
the
answer
is
going
to
be,
in
this
case,
if
we
say
you
win--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
everyone
with
a
--
with
a
--
everyone
with
a
internet
site
who
also
sells
to
a
buyer
who
says
anywhere
in
the
world,
perhaps
--
i
don't
know
how
far
that
reaches
--
seems
pretty
filled
with
implications?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
the
same
you
think?
it's
the
same--
