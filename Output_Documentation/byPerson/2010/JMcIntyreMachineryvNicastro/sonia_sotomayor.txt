excuse
me,
counselor.
going
back
to
the
relationship,
justice
scalia
asked
you
whether
there
was
legal
control,
and
you
said
no.
but
there
was
coordination,
wasn't
there?
isn't
--
doesn't
the
record
show
that
the
english
company
traveled
to
the
trade
shows
with
the
american
company?
wasn't
your
president,
your
english
president,
present
at
the
las
vegas
show
in
which
this
new
jersey
company
first
saw
the
machine?
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
know
there's
a--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
you
approved
all
marketing
efforts.
you
had
to
approve
--
according
to
the
findings
of
the
court
below,
you
approved
all
the
marketing
materials
that
the
american
company--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--then
why
was
your
number
and
name
both
printed
on
the
machine
and
in
the
warranty
book?
the
american
--
obviously,
some
customers
had
to
be
reaching
out
you
to
because
all
the
materials
they
received
directed
them
to
the
english
company,
not
to
the
american
company.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
you've
begged
my
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
did
travel
to
certain
of
the
trade
shows--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--with
the
america
company?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
did
make
suggestions
with
respect
to
advertising?
at
least
with
--
at
least
once,
but
you
did?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
and
you
don't
believe
that
coordinating
your
actions
with
the
distributor
and
appointing
that
distributor
to
distribute
products
wherever
it
can
is
not
enough
for
you
to
reasonably
believe
--
know
that
you're
going
to
be
dragged
into
a
state
where
that
product
has
been
sold--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
has
caused
injury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
it
really,
to
you
--
are
you
saying
that
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
creates
jurisdiction,
that
the
mere
sale
to
a
distributor
anywhere
creates
jurisdiction,
wherever
that
distributor
is
marketing
the
manufacturer's
product?
i
thought
because
in
the
hypothetical
he
created
it
was
they
were
availing
themselves
of
the
u.s.
market,
that
they
were
marketing,
they
went
to
seven
trade
shows.
they
did
merely
--
they
did
something
more
than
the
sale.
so
where's
your
--
what's
your
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
could
you
--
just
one
quick
point
of
clarification.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
a
point
that
your
adversary
raised
in
passing.
i'm
not
quite
sure,
do
you
sell
outright
to
the
american
company?
do
you
ship
a
product
and
they
pay
you,
or
they
only
pay
you
when
they
receive
the
money
from
their
customer?
there
appears
to
be
some
suggestion
of
the
latter.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
is
a
different
question
than
i
asked.
there
was
no
consignment
on
this
machine?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you're
not
claiming
that
there
might
not
be
on
others?
