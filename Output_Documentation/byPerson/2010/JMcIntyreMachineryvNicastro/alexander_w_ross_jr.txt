mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
"all
we
wish
to
do
is
sell
our
products
in
the
states
and
get
paid.
"
that's
what
the
british
manufacturer
said.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
would
say
under
those
circumstances,
yes,
because
the
purpose
that
--
this
particular
manufacturer
purposefully
availed
themselves
of
the
entire
u.s.
market.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
so
every
state
with
the
exception
of
new
jersey,
is
that
the
hypothetical,
your
honor?
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
then
i
would
say
under
those
circumstances,
yes,
new
jersey
would
be
excluded.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
yes.
if
the
manufacturer--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--i
think
it's
the
intent
and
the
additional
conduct
of
the
manufacturer,
your
honor.
i
think,
as
justice
o'connor
said
in
the
asahi
case,
she
gave
several
examples.
i
think
we'd
meet
all
the
examples
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
under
those
circumstances,
of
course,
which
are
different
from
our
case,
it
would
seem
to
me--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--of
course,
of
course.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
if
the
manufacturer
purposefully
availed
itself
of
--
of
the
market
which
would
include
the
world
and
had
a
distributor
for
the
entire
world
and
did--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--yes,
it
would.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
would
say
the
manufacturer
has
to
take
some
additional
conduct.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
well,
if--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--if
there
is
purposeful
availment
and
additional
conduct,
your
honor.
in
this
case
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
correct.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
sure.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
you
do,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
would
say--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--i
would
say
in
--
in
response
to
your
hypothetical
question,
that
because
there
was
purposeful
availment
where
they
came
to
the
united
states,
attended
trade
shows
in
an
effort
to
sell
their
product
to
anyone
who
would
come
to
that
trade
show
throughout
the
united
states,
and
those
sales
were
in
fact
consummated,
then
in
that
case
i
think
that
the
manufacturer
has
done
more
than
just
intend
to
sell.
they
have
taken
certain
positive
steps.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
understand.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
in
--
in
my
judgment,
it's
not
enough
to
just
have
intent,
it's
not
enough
just
to
send
the
product
out
on,
adrift
on
the
stream
of
commerce.
there
have
to
be
some
additional
conduct,
some
concrete
steps
taken.
and
i
believe--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--in
your
hypothetical,
attending
the
trade
shows,
perhaps
hiring
a
distributor,
selling
the
products--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--that's
right.
so
i
think
those
are
the
additional
concrete
steps
that
were
taken
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
yes.
if
they
actively
seek
the
market
there,
they
have
purposely
availed
themselves,
they
have
taken--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
it
depends
on
the
extent
of
the
availment,
i
would
say,
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
it
seems
to
me
--
if
there's--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--all
right.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
would
say
under
--
yes.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
yes,
i
would
say.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that's
a
slightly--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--that's
a
slightly
different
scenario
in
my
judgment,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--because
the
distributor
came
to
the
manufacturer.
in
this
case,
the
manufacturer
from
britain
hired--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--i
understand
that.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
understand
that.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
think--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
well,
your
honor,
if
the
corporation,
the
manufacturer
is
purposely
availing
itself
of
the
madras
market
and
hires
a
distributor
to
go
to
madras
and
to
sell
its
products,
then
indeed
i
don't
see
why
a
court
in
madras
would
not
have
--
and
the
product
explodes
or
causes
some
horrific--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--my
position
is
exactly
what
your
honor
has
just
stated.
they
have
to
do
something
more
than
just
sell.
there
has
to
be
purposeful
availment.
there
has
to
be
some
concrete
action,
attending
trade
shows,
designing
the
product
for
the
market.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
think--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--well,
it
depends
on
the
web
site.
but
in
my
judgment,
attending
trade
shows
is
a
large
factor
that
is
unique
in
this
case.
as
i
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
they
were
--
they
didn't
just
attend
a
trade
show.
they
attended
trade
shows
throughout
the
united
states
to
sell
this
product.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
not
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
but
a
lot
of
other
places.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
well,
mr.
curcio,
who
was
mr.
nicastro's
employer,
went
to
one
of
these
convention
trade
shows
in
las
vegas,
where
he
saw
the
machine.
and
at
that
trade
show
the
british
manufacturer
shared
a
booth
with
the
--
its
american
distributor.
and
that's
where
mr.
curcio,
mr.
nicastro's
employer,
saw
the
machine
and
that's
why
he
decided
to
buy
it
there.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
the
difference
for
this
case,
precisely
this
case,
is
that
we
feel
that
under
those
circumstances
there
may
have
been
minimum
contacts,
even
under
a
traditional
sense
here.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
no,
with
new
jersey,
because
the
british
manufacturer
was
there.
he
was
in
a
booth.
a
new
jersey
person
came
to
the
booth
and
said,
that's
a
great
machine.
there
was
some
kind
of
interaction.
the
record
is
unclear
as
to
what
it
was,
but
the
result
was
the
british
manufacturer
wound
up
selling
its
product--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--it's
more
than
that.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
it's
more
than
--
it's
more
than
that,
your
honor.
it's
more
than
that.
it's
the
distributor
acting
under
the
direction,
guidance,
and
control
of
the
british
manufacturer,
and
there
are
records
in
the
--
in
the
record
there's
plenty
of
reference
to
that.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
he
was
prepared
to
sell
to
anyone.
whether
it
was
from
new
jersey
or
massachusetts
or
connecticut,
it
didn't
matter
as
long
as
the
sale
was
into
the
united
states
and
the
manufacturer
got
the
economic
benefit
of
it.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--well,
if
someone
from
montana
attends
one
of
these
trade
shows
and
decides
to
purchase
one
of
these
machines--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--under
those
circumstances
i
would
say
not.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that's
correct.
that
would
not
be
enough.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the,
if
the
manufacturer
has
purposefully
availed
itself
of
the
entire
united
states
market,
which
is
inclusive
of
montana--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--and
the
machine
somehow
winds
up
in
montana.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
the
individual.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
so
the
individual
is
in
montana;
the
accident
happened
somewhere
else?
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
say
that
wherever
that
machine
was
sold
into,
whether
it
was
in
an
adjoining
state,
and
the
fellow
from
montana
lived
across
the
border,
say--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--i
would
say
that
the
jurisdiction
would
be
better
put
where
the
accident
occurred.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
would
say
that
if
the
--
if
the
manufacturer
has
not
purposefully
availed
itself
of
the
state
of
montana--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--and
has
taken
no
steps--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--to
push
into
montana,
even
though
it
is
seeking
to
sell
to
the
entire
united
states--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--i
think
the
better
location
for
that--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--right.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
answer
is
yes,
there
are
limitations.
there
are
those
limitations,
and
i
think
the
best
way
of
--
of
stating
it
would
be
if
there
is
purposeful
availment
of
entering
a
market
and
you
sell
the
product
into
that
market,
you
take
these
additional
steps
plus
the
intent.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
well,
there
are
conventions.
there's
the
brussels
convention
and
the
uganda--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--they
basically
state,
according
to
my
understanding,
that
where
the
tort
occurred
to
the
signatories
to
that
convention,
which
includes--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--the
united
kingdom;
which
includes
the
united
kingdom.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that
--
then
in
those
cases,
where
the
tort
occurred
there
would
be
jurisdiction
over
the
foreign
manufacturer.
for
example,
if
there's
an
injury
in
belgium
and
the
machine
is
manufactured
in
britain
and
someone
is
hurt
in
belgium,
according
to
those
conventions
then
the
person
in
belgium
could
sue
the
british
company
in
belgium.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
they're
in
our
brief.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that's
correct.
the
united
states
is
not
a
signatory
to
that
convention.
but
the
hypothetical
was
--
and
i
tried
to
answer
the
hypothetical.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
would
say
no
jurisdiction
for
a
component
manufacturer
under
those
circumstances,
unless
the
component
manufacturer
was
deliberately
manufacturing
a
product
for
sale
into
a
state
in
the
united
states.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that's
correct,
but
the
manufacturer
in
your
hypothetical
did
not
purposely
avail
itself
of
the
united
states
market.
he
simply
sold
a
component
part.
this
is,
of
course,
not
a
component
part
case
we
have
here
before
us.
so
he
may
have
known,
there
might
have
been
foreseeability
that
it
was
possible
that.
that's
not
enough.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
our
position
is
that
under
those
circumstances,
if
the
manufacturer
did
not
purposely
avail
itself
of
the
united
states
market
by
hiring
a
distributor--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--that's
the
components
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
right.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
think
it's
different.
and
that's
where
the
limitation
of
the
due
process
clause,
i
think,
comes
into
play
because
that
manufacturer,
making
a
small
component,
a
spring,
a
small
part
for
a
large
machine
like
in
the
asahi
case,
he
may
have
known.
it's
foreseeable
that
this
product--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--i
would
say
there
is
a
difference,
because
that
component--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
the
same
test,
but
it
would
come
out
differently
for
the
component
manufacturer.
that's
the
way
i'd
like
to--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--exactly.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
because
the
manufacturer
of
that
blade
did
not
specifically
target
the
united
states
market.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
but
it's
not
specifically
designed
for
them.
that
--
that
machine
is
not
specifically
designed
for
the
u.s.
market.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
think
there
would
be
a
difference.
i
think
there
would
be
a
difference
because
they
are
combined
in
joining
to
market
into
the
united
states.
but
if
this
is
a
--
a
manufacturer
of
blades
in
birmingham,
england,
and
the
manufacturer
of
blades
in
birmingham,
england
sends
it
to
nottingham,
england,
and
then
something
happens
in
new
jersey
and
all
the
facts
are
the
same,
i
would
say
birmingham
is
off
the
hook.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that
would
be
different
then.
then
there
--
there
is
more
than
that.
there--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--because
he
is
basically
piggybacking
on
the
actions
of
the
manufacturer.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
twenty-six.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
there
were
26
trade
shows.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
yes,
it
is.
joint
appendix
114
to
117.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
right.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
and
if
the
goat
poisons
someone
in
the
united
states
and
the
--
and
the
person
who
raised
the
goat--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--purposely
availed
itself--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--if
--
if
they
take
steps,
concrete
steps,
additional
conduct,
then
yes.
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
sadly
even
if--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--yes,
it
does.
the
internet
--
we
deliberately
did
not
raise
the
internet
or
any
web
sites
in
our
briefs.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
think
if
there
is
purposeful
availment
and
if
the
internet
is
being
used
to
market
specifically
into
the
united
states
and
the
product
causes
harm
to
someone
in
the
united
states--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
those
cases
say
if
there
is
an
interactive
web
site;
in
other
words,
if
the
person
is
sitting
in
the
united
states
and
presses
several
buttons
on
his
computer
and
interacts
and
make
--
consummates
the
transaction,
if
you
will,
with
the
foreign
manufacturer,
then
under
those
circumstances
i
believe
the
trend
of
the
cases
seems
to
be
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that
was
one
of
the
four
examples
that
justice
o'connor
gave
us
in
asahi,
advertising
for--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--yes.
my
position
is
yes,
because
they
are
--
they
are
attempting
to
sell
into
the
united
states
with
advertising.
but
the
trend
of
the
decisions
has
been
that
it
has
to
be
an
interactive
web
site.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
yes,
you
can.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
if
it's
an
interactive
web
site
where
you
can
sit
in
new
jersey,
order
a
product,
the
product
is
then
delivered
by
the
foreign
manufacturer
into
new
jersey
and
the
product
then
chops
off
four
fingers
of
someone's
hand--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
not
enough.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
that's
like
a
billboard.
that's
not
enough.
that's
just
a
pure
advertising;
not
enough.
but
if
the
additional
steps
that
i
just
mentioned
are
taken
and
the
sale
occurs--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--i
believe
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
the
additional
conduct.
the
purposeful
availment,
which
is
what
we
have
in
your
hypothetical
and
the
actual
transaction,
the
sale,
then
we
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
in
this
case,
the
manufacturer
says
they
own
the
machines
until
they're
paid
for
in
full.
the
machine
was
not
paid
for
in
full.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
right.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
right.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
if
the
internet
web
site
is
interactive,
so
you
can
sit
in
new
jersey,
order
the
product,
complete
the
transaction,
send
money,
and
in
response
to
the
money
coming,
you
get
a
product--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--not
just
an
advertisement.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
it's
not
enough,
in
my
judgment,
if
--
under
the
internet
example
that
you
just
gave.
if
there's
an
interactive
web
site
where
the
person
in
new
jersey
can
press
buttons
on
his
computer
and
complete
the
transaction
with
the
result
that
the
product
comes
to
new
jersey,
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
say
there
is--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
would
say
under
those
circumstances,
that
that's
part
of
what
the
manufacturer
requires,
but
the
end
result
is
that
the
machine
winds
up
in
new
jersey
through
this
contact
between
the
person
and
the
manufacturer,
then
i
would
say
that
would
be
enough
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
i
would
say
in
that
case
they
have
deliberately
targeted
the
entire
united
states
market,
but
they
want
you
to
go
through
their
distributor,
which
they
have
hired--
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
--in
ohio,
and
he
sends
it,
it's
the
same
situation.
well,
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i
would
simply
like
to
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgement
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
in
this
case.
mr.
alexander
w.
ross
jr.
thank
you.
