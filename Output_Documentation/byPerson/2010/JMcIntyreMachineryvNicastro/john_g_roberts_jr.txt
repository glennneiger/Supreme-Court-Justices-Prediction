chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-1343,
j.
mcintyre
machinery,
ltd.
v.
nicastro.
mr.
fergenson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
perhaps
you
would
like
to
reserve
some
of
your
time
for
rebuttal,
counsel?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
ross?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
he
said:
we
want
to
do
that,
but
we
don't
like
new
jersey,
so
don't
sell
our
products
in
new
jersey,
and
the
ohio
company
nonetheless
does
so?
could
you
get
them
--
can
you
hail
them
into
court
in
new
jersey?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
he
said:
but
i
have
no
intention
of
selling
in
new
jersey,
i'm
afraid
i
might
get
sued
there
and
i
don't
want
to
get
sued
there.
he
is
not
entering
the
stream
of
commerce
in
the
united
states.
he's
entering
a
stream
of
commerce
that
detours
around
new
jersey.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
it
would
be
excluded?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
depends
on
the
intent
of
the
manufacturer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
you
could
respond
to
justice
breyer's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
difference
does
it
make
that
they
go
to
a
trade
show
somewhere
other
than
new
jersey?
we
have
the
notion
that
they're
availing
themselves
of
the
--
the
entire
united
states
market.
that's
--
i'll
accept
that.
what
does
the
trade
show
in
nevada
add
to
the
jurisdictional
ties
to
new
jersey?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
nevada?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
there
is
no
scrap
metal
plant
in
montana?
can
montana
be
a
jurisdiction
in
a
case
like
this?
you
know,
a
montana
worker
is
over
in
new
jersey
and
comes
back
to
his
home
in
montana,
and
he's
been
injured.
do
they
avail
themselves
of
the
market
in
montana
when
there's
no
market
for
their
products
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
he's
just
injured
by
one
of
these
machines
somewhere
else,
but
he's
from
montana.
can
he
sue
in
montana?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
--
i
thought
this
was
what
the
case
was
all
about:
whether
this
is
--
the
stream
of
commerce
is
sufficient
to
add
a
basis
on
top
of
the
plaintiff's
residence.
and
i
would
have
thought
to
me,
that's
a
significant
limitation
on
your
theory
to
say
that
in
areas
where
you
don't
expect
to
be
hailed
into
court
because
your
machine
is
not
going
to
be
used,
you
can't
be.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
not
the
machine.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
exactly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
it
be
put
elsewhere?
could
it
be
put
in
the
other
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
better
--
i
know
--
i
know
you
think
it's
better,
but
can
he
be
sued
in
montana?
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
obviously,
is
we're
talking
about
the
stream
of
commerce
in
the
united
states,
but
the
stream
doesn't
wash
over
the
united
states
evenly.
the
manufacturer,
as
i
asked
earlier,
may
decide,
i
don't
want
to
sell
new
jersey.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
manufacturer
may
reasonably
assume
his
machines
aren't
going
to
be
in
montana
because
there
is
no
scrap
metal
business
in
montana.
so
i'm
just
trying
to
see
if
there
are
limitations
to
your
theory
about
the
stream
of
commerce
covers
everything.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
but
the
market
cannot
be
simply
the
united
states,
because
you
carve
out
new
jersey
if
the
manufacturer
does,
you
carve
out
montana.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
let's
say
he
does
know,
it's
a
component
part
for
something
that
is
sold,
widely
sold,
in
the
united
states.
or
it's
a
component
part
of
this
machine.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
would
it
be
--
so
you
have
an
entirely
different
test?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
--
you
have
an
entirely
different
test
for
a
component
manufacturer
than
you
do
for
the
finished
product
manufacturer.
the
component
manufacturer
may
well
know
to
a
certainty
that
his
component
is
going
to
be
used
in
a
product
that's
sold
in
the
united
states.
let's
say
he
makes
a
component
for
this
machine.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that
different?
shouldn't
it
be
the
same
test?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
say
he
makes
the
25-inch
blade
that
only
goes
into
this
machine.
that's
the
only
market
for
it.
does
--
no
difference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
that
was
poorly
phrased.
is
it
the
same
test
for
the
machine
or
is
it
a
different
test?
is
it
your
component
test?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
can
there
not
--
how
can
there
possibly
not
be
purposeful
availment
if
the
manufacturer
of
the
25-inch
blade
knows
it's
only
going
to
be
used
in
mcintyre's
machine
and
it
knows
that
mcintyre
is
trying
to
sell
its
machine
in
the
united
states?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
put
it
in
a
product
that
is
only
going
to
be
--
that
he
knows
is
going
to
be
sold
in
the
united
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
a
partnership.
one
of
the
partners
makes
the
shell
of
the
machine;
the
other
partner
makes
the
insides
of
the
machine.
are
they
as
individual
companies,
are
they
availing
themselves
in
the
united
states
market?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
everybody
knows
this
except
me.
do
you
--
are
web
sites
targeted
to
the
united
states?
don't
you
--
you
can
--
let's
say
they
put
it
on
their
web
site
in
england.
can't
you
--
can't
--
can't
i
access
that
from
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
they
don't
even
have
to
send
the
web
site
to
the
united
states?
they
just
have
to
have
a
web
site?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
has
to
be
interactive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it's
just
--
what
if
it
says,
here,
we're
mcintyre
on
the
web
site
name,
we
make
these
machines,
give
us
a
call
at
this
number
if
you
want
to
buy
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
enough?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
this
distinction
is
somewhere
in
the
due
process
clause?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
complete?
it's
got
to
complete
the
transaction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
it's
--
you
know,
punch
these
numbers
and
we
will
send
you
an
application
for
a
machine,
is
that
not
enough,
because
he's
got
to
complete
the
transaction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
if
they
say,
fill
this
out,
and
contact
this
person,
mcintyre,
whatever,
in
ohio,
that's
where
you
can
get
one
of
our
machines,
that's
enough?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
their--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
ross.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
fergensen,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
