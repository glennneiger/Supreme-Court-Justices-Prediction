bader

in
all
of
those
cases
there
was
a
forum
in
the
united
states
where
someone
injured
in
the
united
states
could
sue.
your
proposition
is
that
a
company
can
deliberately
send
its
products,
wants
to
explore
the
u.s.
market.
but
i
take
it
that
there
is
no
place
in
the
united
states,
because
new
jersey
is
no
different
than
california
or
any
other
place
--
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
no
forum
in
which
mcintyre
can
be
sued,
even
though
it
set
up
this
distribution
arrangement
for
the
very
purpose
of
having
its
machines
in
as
many
locations
in
the
united
states
as
it
could?
is
there
a
forum
in
the
united
states
where
it
could
be
sued?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
could
be
reached
in
ohio.
now,
does
that
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense?
is
it
any
more
convenient
for
mcintyre
to
come
to
ohio
than
new
jersey?
it's
a
lot
less
convenient
for
mr.
nicastro,
who
had
his
fingers
removed
by
this
machine.
but
you
are
conceding
that
there
is
a
forum
where
this
british
company
can
be
sued
on
a
tort
that
occurred
in
new
jersey.
explain
to
me
why,
since
there
is
a
forum
in
the
united
states,
the
logical
one
isn't
new
jersey
rather
than
ohio.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
you
the
question:
where
can
it
be
sued?
well,
something
happened
in
new
jersey.
the
machine,
allegedly
defective
machine,
caused
a
harm
there.
what
happened
in
ohio?
what
basis
for
specific
jurisdiction
is
there
in
ohio?
there
was
no
tort
in
ohio.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
kind
of
common
law
indemnity
are
we
dealing
with
here?
where
does
mr.
nicastro
sue?
he
hasn't
got
any
assignment,
any
indemnity.
mr.
nicastro
is
injured
in
the
united
states
by
a
machine
manufactured
in
england
and
he
wants
to
sue,
understandably,
in
the
united
states.
why
are
we
talking
about
assignments,
indemnity?
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
mr.
nicastro.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
would
just
like
to
know
first
--
you
said
there
is
jurisdiction
in
ohio
and
not
in
new
jersey.
in
new
jersey,
it's
the
place
where
the
accident
occurred,
and
in
ohio
there's
nothing
but
the
relationship
between
the
distributor
--
there's
a
contract
between
the
distributor
and
mcintyre.
so
why
does
ohio
have
jurisdiction
over
this
new
jersey
tort?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
forum
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
claim
in
suit.
that's
very
important.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
still
don't
follow
how
mr.
nicastro
gets
involved
with
assignment,
indemnity.
mr.
nicastro
has
a
claim
against
--
well,
he
sued
them
both,
but
the
distributor
is
now
bankrupt.
and
he
says,
well,
this
is
specific
jurisdiction;
specific
jurisdiction,
as
international
shoe
teaches,
is
where
the
claim
arose.
international
shoe,
it
arose
in
the
state
of
washington
because
that's
where
the
shoe
--
the
people
who
were
promoting
sale
of
international
shoe's
--
international
shoe's
shoes
worked
every
day.
so
it
was
a
claim
relating
to
a
tax
owed
by
international
shoe
based
on
the
events
that
occurred
in
california.
it
was
not
all-purpose
jurisdiction.
and
your
suggestion
that
ohio
somehow
is
a
proper
forum
for
mr.
nicastro's
tort
claim,
i
really
don't
follow
that.
justice

bader

asahi
--
asahi,
mr.
fergenson,
was
a
litigation
between
a
japanese
component
part
manufacturer
and
a
taiwanese
finished
product
manufacturer.
what
--
how
in
the
world
could
you
compare
that
case,
which
really
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
united
states?
it's
--
it's
a
japanese
valve
manufacturer
sells
the
valve
to
a
tire
maker
in
taiwan,
and
there
should
be
--
that
suit
should
go
forward
in
the
united
states?
i
can
see
it
going
forward
in
--
in
japan,
but
it
has
no
connection
with
the
united
states.
and
how
can
you
possibly
compare
that
with
this
case
where
somebody
was
injured
by
a
machine
that
malfunctions,
allegedly?
there
was
something
very
interesting
you
said
in
your
brief.
and
you
said
the
u.k.,
which
you
--
you
say
--
now
you
added
ohio,
but
you
said
u.k.
would
be
the
place
for
mr.
nicastro
to
go.
it
provides
a
trusted
legal
system.
what
would
be
your
answer
if
the
manufacturer,
same
arrangement
with
a
distributor,
sell
anyplace
in
the
united
states
you
can,
is
from
china?
would
you
give
the
same
answer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
--
you
made
a
point
about
the
trusted
legal
system.
well,
let's
say
it
was
russia,
mexico.
you
make
--
pick
any
one.
the
machine
is
manufactured
in
one
of
those
countries
where
it's
not
so
certain
that
there's
a
trusted
legal
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
those
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
is
the
jurisdictional
rule
that
civil
law
systems
have
always
had?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question?
i
mean,
the
united
states
has
been
telling
the
rest
of
the
world:
we
do
recognize
and
enforce
your
judgments--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
there
is
a
--
a
proper
jurisdictional
basis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
do,
and
we
would
like
you
to
recognize
ours,
and
we
don't
get
that
reciprocity,
but
we
are
still
trying
to
get
it.
but
the
united
states
has
taken
a
very
neighborly
view
about
recognizing
and
enforcing
foreign
judgments.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
the
new
jersey
company
that
bought
this
machine
find
out
about
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
basis
would
only
be
the
plaintiff's
residence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we
don't
accept
that
as
a
sufficient
basis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
--
this
eeoc
convention
on
jurisdiction
and
judgments,
does
that
operates
only
within
the
community?
justice

there
are
--
there
are
--
there
are
some
cases,
just
beginning

as
a
beginning
stages,
aren't
there,
involving
sales
through
the
internet?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--
just
summarized.
the
accident
occurred
in
france
and
the
defective
tire
that
allegedly
caused
the
bus
to
overturn
was
made
and
sold
in
europe.
in
this
case,
the
accident
occurred
at
a
workplace
in
new
jersey
and
the
manufacturer
of
the
machine,
a
uk
company,
wanted
to
sell
its
products
anywhere
and
everywhere
in
the
united
states.
in
neither
case
was
the
u.s.
forum
one
that
could
properly
exercise
general,
all-purpose
jurisdiction
over
the
foreign
defendants.
but
in
this
case,
contrary
to
the
court's
judgment,
specific
jurisdiction
would
be
appropriately
exercised
by
new
jersey
courts.
indeed,
what
form
is
more
appropriate
than
one
in
the
place
where
mcintyre
uk's
machine
was
shipped,
installed
and
malfunction
severing
local
worker,
nicastro's
fingers.
the
plaintiff
and
witnesses
to
the
accident
are
in
new
jersey.
the
law
normally
applicable
to
industrial
accidents
is
the
law
of
the
place
of
injury.
and
of
prime
importance,
the
foreign
manufacturer
sought
deliberately
to
develop
a
market
for
its
machines
anywhere
and
everywhere
in
the
united
states.
the
pattern
presented
here
is
familiar
in
today's
international
commercial
relationships.
a
foreign
industrialist
seeks
to
attract
u.s.
purchases
for
the
products
it
manufactures.
mcintyre
uk
did
so
in
typical
fashion.
it
engaged
a
u.s.
distributor
to
promote
its
products.
it
attended
and
exhibited
at
annual
trade
shows
and
other
demonstrations
in
diverse
u.s.
locations.
it
hoped
to
derive
substantial
revenue
from
sales
to
u.s.
purchases.
and
indeed,
for
some
years,
sales
of
mcintyre
uk's
products
to
u.s.
purchases
compared
favorably
to
sales
made
to
buyers
in
the
rest
of
the
world.
where
in
the
united
states
buyers
resided?
new
jersey
or
nevada,
matter
not
at
all
to
mcintyre
uk.
it's
goal
was
to
sell
as
much
as
it
could,
wherever
it
could
and
it
had
liability
insurance
concerning
personal
injuries
caused
by
its
products.
although,
nothing
impeded
it
from
targeting
only
particular
states,
it
excluded
no
region
or
state
from
the
market
it
wished
to
reach
hardly
“at
home”
in
each
state
as
its
market.
rather
than
the
united
states
as
a
whole,
new
jersey
would
have
been
an
unlikely
candidate
for
exclusion.
mcintyre
uk
made
machines
used
in
recycling
metals
and
new
jersey
recycles
more
metals
than
any
other
states
of
the
united
states.
there
are
two
things
mcintyre
uk
clearly
did
not
want,
subjection
to
us
courts
and
judgment
under
the
product
liability
law
of
any
state
of
the
united
states.
to
that
end,
it
heavily
avoided
shipping
directly
to
the
united
states
and
engaged
in
exclusive
u.s.
distributor
to
deliver
its
products
stateside.
should
that
manner
of
marketing
have
enabled
to
escape
jurisdiction
in
a
state
where
one
of
its
products
is
sold,
installed
and
because
of
the
defect
in
design
or
in
the
manufacturing
process,
causes
injury
to
a
local
user.
"of
course,
not"
would
be
a
sensible
answer.
but
under
today's
judgment,
mcintyre
uk
is
free
to
seek
out
u.s.
customers
nationwide,
yet
enjoy
immunity
from
suit
in
any
and
every
state.
our
prior
decisions
call
for
no
such
result.
first,
they
plainly
reject
the
notion
affecting
the
plurality
opinion
that
a
foreign
defendant
must
somehow
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
state
court
in
order
to
legitimize
the
course
exercise
of
adjudicatory
authority
over
it.
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
the
fairness,
judged
by
the
relationship
among
the
defendant,
the
forum
and
the
episode
in
suit
is
what
counts.
fictions
of
implied
consent,
prior
decisions
teach
do
not
advance
the
proper
inquiry.
if
fairness
is
the
central
concept
in
determining
questions
of
personal
jurisdiction
as
we
have
said
it
is,
then
one
might
ask,
“is
it
not
fair
and
reasonable
given
the
mode
of
trading,"
of
which
this
case
is
an
example,
“to
require
the
international
seller
of
a
dangerous
product
to
defend
at
the
place
of
its
product
causes
injury?”
on
what
measure
of
reason
and
fairness
can
it
be
considered
undue
to
require
mcintyre
uk
to
defend
in
new
jersey
as
an
incident
of
these
efforts
to
develop
a
market
for
its
industrial
machines
anywhere
and
everywhere
in
the
united
states?
is
not
the
burden
on
mcintyre
uk
to
defend
in
new
jersey
a
reasonable
cause
of
transacting
business
internationally
in
comparison
to
the
burden
on
new
jersey
work
on
nicastro
to
go
to
nottingham,
england,
transporting
his
witnesses
with
him
to
gain
recompense
for
an
injury
sustained
using
mcintyre's
product
at
his
workplace
in
saddle
brook,
new
jersey.
some
30
years
ago,
this
court
said
that
when
a
manufacturer
or
distributor
aims
to
sell
its
products
to
customers
in
several
states,
it
is
reasonable
to
subject
it
to
suit
in
any
one
of
the
states
if
it’s
allegedly
defective
product.
has
there
been
the
source
of
injury?
the
court
was
--
is
right
then
as
it
is
wrong
today.
in
the
past
marking
case
in
this
area,
international
shoe
company
against
washington,
the
court
observed
that
an
estimate
of
inconveniences
is
relevant
in
determining
whether
appropriate
defendant
maybe
called
on
to
respond
away
from
its
home
or
principal
place
of
business.
in
undertaking
such
an
estimate,
courts
have
differently
appraised
two
situations.one,
cases
involving
a
local
plaintiff
like
nicastro
injured
in
his
home
state
by
the
activity
of
a
defendant
like
mcintyre
uk
engaged
in
international
trade.
and
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
a
natural
or
a
legal
person,
whose
economic
activities
and
legal
involvements
are
largely
home
based,
one
who
harbors
no
designs
to
gain
substantial
revenue
from
sales
and
distant
markets.
this
case
fits
the
first
category,
a
local
plaintiff
injured
by
the
activity
of
a
manufacturer
seeking
to
exploit
a
multistate
or
global
market.
on
any
fair
estimate
of
the
inconveniences,
nicastro
should
prevail
before
this
court
for
the
reasons
just
stated
developed
further
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
justice
sotomayor,
justice
kagan
and
i
would
hold
mcintyre
uk
answerable
in
new
jersey
for
the
harm
nicastro
has
suffered
using
mcintyre's
uk
shearing
machine
at
his
workplace
in
that
state.
while
i
dissent
from
the
court's
judgment,
i
take
heart
that
the
plurality
opinion
does
not
speak
for
the
court
for
that
opinion,
takes
a
giant
step
back
from
the
course
this
court
has
pursued
since
international
shoe
and
would
restore
a
way
of
thinking
about
personal
jurisdiction
long
discredited
for
its
detachment
from
the
realities
of
today's
trading
relationships.
