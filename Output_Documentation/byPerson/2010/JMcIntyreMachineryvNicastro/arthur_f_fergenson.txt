mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
j.
mcintyre
did
not
direct
any
activity
at
residents
of
new
jersey
either
itself
or
by
directing
its
distributor
mma
to
do
so
and
had
no
awareness
or
knowledge
that
the
distributor
took
the
action
that
it
did
toward
new
jersey,
new
jersey
lacked
adjudicative
jurisdiction.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
no,
your
honor.
it
was
not.
and
both
under
ohio
law,
wells
v.
komatsu
america,
and
under
the
restatement
--
second
--
agency,
section
1-1,
the
right
to
control
is
essential
to
ascribe
actions
to
create
an
agency,
and
it's
on
a
per-purpose
basis.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
very
good,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
very
good,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
your
honor,
that's
what
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
held,
and
that's
how
we
fashioned
the--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--the
test.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
no,
your
honor.
it
wanted
to
sell
its
product
anywhere
that
the
distributor
could
find.
the
distributor
was
the
market
manager.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
as
many
as
possible,
wherever
the
distributor
could
find
a
customer,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
well--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--well,
your
honor,
because,
first,
this
court's
jurisprudence
looks
to
a
direct
act
from
world-wide
volkswagen
and
even
before,
as
it
brought
forward
hanson.
as
this
court
has
applied
world-wide
volkswagen,
burger
king,
and
justice
o'connor's
concurrence
in
asahi
and
the
other
occurrence
--
concurrence,
justice
brennan's
concurrence
in
asahi,
look
toward
a
specific
state.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
yes.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
well,
your
honor,
in
burger
king,
in
hanson,
in
world-wide
volkswagen,
the
purposeful
availment
is
defined
as
conducting
activities
within
the
forum
state.
the
--
this
court,
through
those
opinions,
foreseeability,
clear
notice,
reasonably
anticipate
--
all
converge.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
ohio.
it
could
have
been
proceeded
against
in
ohio.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
well,
your
honor,
first,
the
issue
of
convenience,
choice
of
law,
conflict
of
law,
as
a
determinative
factor
was
rejected
by
this
court.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
well,
your
honor,
under
ohio
law,
the
--
there
can
be
an
assignment.
there
was
no
written
contract
between
mma
and
j.
mcintyre.
there
can
be
an
assignment
in
return
for
a
release
of
a
common
law
indemnification
right.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
well,
your
honor,
ohio
explicitly
provides,
and
they
are
--
it's
arisen
in
statute
of
limitation
cases,
and
it
goes
back
to
travelers
indemnity
v.
trowbridge,
that
an
action
under
both
express
and
common
law
indemnity
arises
under
contract.
so
upon
the
assignment,
and
there
need
not
be
a
judgment
under
ohio
law
--
that's
fort
defiance
construction
v.
village
of
grover
hill
--
there
can
be
an
assignment
of
a
common
law
indemnity
under
strict
product
liability.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
nicastro
had
an
action
under
strict
product
liability.
i
want
to
come
back
to
more
fully
answer
the
why
question
that
you
asked:
why
is
it
just
and
right
that
he
go
to
ohio?
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
ohio
has
new
jersey
--
jurisdiction.
as
your
honor
noticed,
there
are
three
places
that
mr.
nicastro,
in
looking
over
this,
could
have
chosen:
united
kingdom,
which
he
is
now
in,
in
filing
a
claim
in
the
liquidation
proceedings;
ohio;
and
new
jersey.
the
accident
occurred
in
new
jersey.
that's
a
forum
non
conveniens
issue
that's--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--that's
a
convenience
issue,
a
forum
non
conveniens.
and
justice
brennan
was
clear
before
burger
king
that
that's
what
he
wanted
to
see
the
law
go
in
the
direction
of.
he
was
clear
about
that.
ohio,
however,
in
looking
at
international
shoe,
going
back
to
international
shoe,
which
talks
about
the
relationship
between
the
defendant
and
the
forum
state--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--and
--
and
the
cause
of
action,
yes.
there
--
the
one
place
where
both
the
distributor,
who
would
upon
suit
and
then
a
claim
over
under
product,
strict
product
liability
would
disappear
--
that's
why
you
can
get
an
assignment
--
the
distributor
is
in
ohio,
and
so
too
is
the
contract
relationship.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
it
--
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
nicastro
could
have
contacted
mma
and
stated:
i
have
a
strict
product
liability
action
--
or
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
the
statute
of
limitations
was
2
years
in
both
cases.
ohio
would
have
applied
new
jersey
strict
liability
law.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
i
agree,
your
honor;
it
is
choice
of
law.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
and,
your
honor--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--no,
because--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--well,
your
honor,
in
the
--
in
justice
o'connor's
footnote
on
national
contacts
in
asahi,
which
was
not
disputed
and
i
think
essentially
accepted
by
justice
brennan,
in
that
footnote
it
states
that
national
contacts
is
for
the
national
sovereign
to
decide.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
this
court
has
not
evaluated
under
the
fifth
amendment
what
circumstances
it
may
be,
and
this
is
speculation,
how
congress
would
establish
it.
it
may
be
that
congress--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
i
think
that--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--your
honor,
i
think
that,
without
klaxon
and
with
a
reasonable
choice
of
venue,
congress
could
establish
a
uniform
system
to
bring
--
to
bring
foreign
defendants
into
this
country.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
i
think
that,
with
that
one
step--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that,
with
that
one
step
beyond--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
one
looks
at
this
as
part
of
the
congress's
power
to
control,
let's
say,
imports,
then
as
a
condition
--
and
this
is
what
the
proposed
foreign
manufacturer's
legal
accountability
act--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
well,
your
honor,
i
think
--
and
i
go
to
two
words
in
particular
in
burger
king,
one
taken
from
hanson,
which
is
essential
--
it
is
essential
in
each
case
that
there
be
a
purposeful
availment
of
the
privilege
of
conducting
activities
within
the
forum;
and
then
the
other--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
because
there
was
a
direction
of
the
distributor
to
go
into
the
state
where
the
accident
occurred.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
if
the
--
yes,
your
honor,
if
the
states
are
assigned
by
name.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
because
that
distributor
--
unless
that
distributor
is
told,
you
must
go,
like
a
traveling
salesperson,
you
must
go
into
each
state,
you
must
personally
go
into
each
state
--
that's
purposeful
availment.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
it
was
not
told
to
do
anything
more
than
to
sell
products,
not
in
as
many--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--yes.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
no,
your
honor.
there
is
a
letter
that's
undated
that
speaks
about
we
have
advertised
under
your
direction
and
per
your
suggestions.
that
letter
also
states
that:
we've
spent
$350,000
and
we
performed
the
--
we
performed
repairs
and
warranty
service
without
seeking
reimbursement
from
you,
and
that's
consistent
with
the
distant
relationship
here.
your
honor,
we
asked
for
the
names
of
the
customers.
we
didn't
get
it.
we
didn't
get
--
we
didn't
drop-ship.
and
that
would
obviously
have
been
a
lot
less
expensive
in
cost
rather
than
shipping
it
to
ohio.
they
were
the
market
maker.
they
controlled
the
relationships
with
the
individual
customers.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
and,
your
honor,
the
record
shows
that
we
were
sued
in
kentucky,
we
were
sued
in
massachusetts.
the
kentucky
dispute
was
settled,
was
resolved
by
dismissal
under
the
statute
of
limitations,
but--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
the
--
the
company
that
distributed
the
products
stated
in
a
letter
that
we
conformed
our
advertising
to
what
you
suggested.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
would
ask
your
honor
to
look
at
professor
kurland's
university
of
chicago
law
review
article
in
1958,
very
influential,
and
to
look
at
footnote
99,
in
which
professor
kurland
quotes,
all
quotes,
from
this
court's
transcript
of
record
in
international
shoe.
and
in
the
international
shoe
the
salespeople
were
controlled
by
international
shoe.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
--
that
the
principles
of
law
as
stated,
because
they're
law
and
they're
applied
in
each
case,
it
could
--
which
you
apply
to
the
facts,
i
believe
that
the
rejection
of
the
convenience
test
by
this
court
in
world-wide
volkswagen,
savchuk,
and
in
shaffer,
where
justice
brennan
posited
that
there
be
a
convenience
test,
that
those--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--i
believe
that
that
conflicts,
your
honor,
with
asahi.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
look
at
--
and
--
and
the
answer
would
not
be,
off
the
cuff,
the
same.
it
would
not
be
flatly
the
same.
there's
been
a
recent
decision
by
judge
chasanow
on
melamine
in
which
chasanow
applied
the
availability
law
that
this
court
has
set
forth
in
piper
and
gulf
oil
and
--
and
the
other
cases
that
follow,
and
determined
that
china
was
an
available
forum
for
the
plaintiffs
suing
for
the
harm
to
their
children
from
tainted
milk.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
so
under
piper,
gulf
oil,
and
i
can't
remember
the
name
of
the
other
case
that
judge
chasanow
relied
upon,
they
are
difficult
cases,
and
the
ability
of
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
other
forum
is
available
is
quite
cabined.
and
they
are
difficult,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
thank
you,
your
honor.
justice
breyer,
i
would
--
in
response
to
your
concern,
i
would
ask
you
to
look
at
page
29
of
the
state's
amicus
brief.
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
new
jersey
is
a
state
within
our
union
or
of
the
specifics
of
new
jersey
products
liability
law
should
not
allow
petitioner
to
avoid
jurisdiction,
its
own
lack
of
research,
prior
to
embarking
on
a
nationwide
marketing
campaign
is
no
defense.
i
think
that--
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
and
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
said
there
was
a
suggestion
that
some
trades
could
have
been
by
consignment.
i
believe
that
that
is
outside
of
this
--
taken
out
of
this
case
by
an
admission
in
the
brief
--
at
least
for
this
sale
--
in
the
brief
in
our
position
to
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
at
1920
filed
october
11th,
2006,
where
they
state,
where
respondent
states
it
was
sold
by
us
to
mma,
and
it
was
sold
by
mma
to
curcio
scrap
metal.
so,
there
is
no
consignment,
there
is
no
consignment
under
9102
which
ohio
has
adopted.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
yes.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
the
evidence
in
the
record
under
9102
which
ohio
has
adopted,
i
think
can
only
be
reasonably
viewed
--
and
this
court
obviously
treats
it
as
de
novo,
on
a
jurisdictional
review
--
can
only
be
viewed
as
not
a
consignment
because
mma
was
in
the
business
of
selling
the
products
to
others.
let
me
say
that
for
the
--
there
was
no
interaction
in
the
record
with
anyone
from
new
jersey
by
mma
or
by
j.
mcintyre.
it
was
the
booth,
and
then
there
was
an
order.
and
if
you
look
at
the
invoice,
it
says
verbal
order.
there
was
an
order
by
the
son
of
the
owner
of
curcio
metal
works,
and
that's
it.
the
order
was
fulfilled.
mr.
arthur
f.
fergenson
i
think
that
most
sophisticated
distribution
networks
--
and
this
one
was
not
--
i
--
the
defense
takes
it
as
a
--
takes
on
the
issue
of
this
as
a
scheme.
most
sophisticated
distribution
networks,
such
as
the
manufacturers
you're
talking
about,
there
is
--
there
is
recourse
to
remedies
throughout
the
united
states,
whether
against
the
distributor
or
against
the
manufacturer.
