justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
would
we
--
wouldn't
the
rule
that
you're
setting
forth,
willful
blindness
not
being
a
part
of
it,
mean
that
nobody
would
ever
get
a
patent
search,
because
what
would
be
the
inducement
to
do
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
but
you're
not
presumed
to
copy
other
people's
items,
which
is
the
difference.
is
there
--
let
me
just
ask
you
something.
assuming
we
were
to
find
the
willful
blindness
test
to
actual
knowledge,
the
facts
of
your
case,
the
fact
that
they
did
not
give
the
name
of
the
product
that
they
copied
to
their
patent
attorney,
is
that
just,
as
a
matter
of
law,
willful
blindness?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
patents
--
are
patents
--
can
you
do
a
patent
search
on
the
basis
of
the
name
of
the
holder?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
the
product
that
they
copied,
did
it
have
the
name
of
the
holder
of
the
patent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
is
the
likelihood
that
if
they
had
actually
given
the
attorney
the
name
of
the
product,
that
he
would
not
have
found
the
patent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
it
would
be
probably
90
percent,
assuming
--
because
there's
always
errors
in
searches.
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
--
i'm
a
little
confused.
if
you
knew
that
there
was
a
patent
under
(b),
and
you
still
gave
the
fryer
--
patented
the
fryer
that
you
know
it
is
a
patented
fryer
to
montgomery
ward
or
sunbeam
to
sell,
you're
not
liable
under
(b),
because
why?
what
act
of
yours
was
not
purposeful?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
we'll
go
as
to
--
let's
--
let's
just
stop
there.
justice
kennedy
and
i
believe
the
chief
have
asked
you,
isn't
your
entire
argument
that
we
should
move
the
knowing
knowledge
of
(c)
into
(b)?
and
you
said
no.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
explain
to
me--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
then
explain
to
me--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what's
not
purposeful
or
knowing
--
what's
not
purposeful,
culpable
conduct,
if
you
know
there's
a
patent
or
--
you
can
decide
whether
knowledge
includes
willful
blindness
or
not,
but
it's
not
my
issue.
if
you
know
there's
a
patent
and
you
give
the
product
to
someone
else
to
sell,
how
can
you
not
be
culpable
for
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
introducing
a
mistake
of
law
defense
to
knowledge.
you're
saying,
i
really
didn't
know
that
it
was
unlawful.
i
knew
that
there
was
a
patent,
but
i
really
thought
that
it
wasn't
a
legal
patent,
so
i
was
going
to
violate
what
i
know
wasn't
legal.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
do
you
get
off
the
hook
for
making
a
mistake
of
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
would
never
have
any
patents
enforced
under
your
theory.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--do
so,
because
we
still
have
to
define
knowledge.
if
we
accept
that
actual
knowledge
can
have
a
different
definition,
just
not
the
should
have
known
definition--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--do
we
have
to
define
what
knowledge
--
what
kind
of
knowledge
we
are
talking
about?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
agree.
we
can
say
that.
but
how
does
it
help--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
development
of
law
for
us
to
simply
say
you
--
it
is
not
so
much
knowledge
that
you
have
to
know
the
specific
patent
by
number.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
forget
the
narrow
rule.
what
do
you
think
the
rule
should
be
to
articulate
what
justice
breyer
would
like?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
am
sorry.
why
are
you
doing
that?
i
thought
that
you
came
in
arguing
that
you
have
to
have
actual
knowledge
of
the
patent.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
by
number,
and
that
was
the
conversation
we
had
earlier,
and
that
the
patent
covered
the
scope
of
your
invention.
