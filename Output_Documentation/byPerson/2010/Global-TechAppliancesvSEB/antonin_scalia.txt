justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
okay,
as
far
as
you're
concerned?
you
would
consider
that
comes
within
your
first
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
not,
but
willful
blindness
would?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
even
willful
blindness
wouldn't
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
--
why
wouldn't
you
tell
him?
if
you're
--
if
you're
honestly
interested
in
finding
out
whether
there
is
a
patent
that
you're
infringing,
why
wouldn't
you
tell
me
the
reason
we're
concerned
is
that
we
have
reverse-engineered
this
from
somebody
else's
product?
just
check
to
see
if
seb
has
a
patent
on
any
of
this
stuff
that
we've
reverse-engineered.
that's
what
i
would
have
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
their
practice
to
reverse-engineer
from
other
people's
products?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
can
understand
when
you
have
a
new
product
of
your
own;
of
course,
you
just
give
it
to
an
attorney.
but
when
you
have
reverse-engineered,
not
to
tell
them
that
it
was
reversed-engineered
seems
to
me
really
trying
to
keep
yourself
in
the
dark.
what
you
want
to
get
from
the
attorney
is
a
piece
of
paper
that
he
can
show
to
montgomery
ward
that,
yes,
this
product
is
not
--
as
it
turns
out,
montgomery
ward
did
accept
it
and
got
hit
with
liability
for
infringing
a
patent.
i
--
i
find
that
really
incredible
that,
in
an
honest
attempt
to
find
whether
there
was
any
patent
infringement
going
on,
you
wouldn't
even
tell
the
patent
attorney
that
you've
reverse-engineered
somebody
else's
product.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
they
wouldn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we're
not
going
to
adopt
a
special
rule
for
the
deep-fryer
industry.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
especially--
justice
antonin
scalia
--listen,
the
--
the
reason
you
got
the
opinion
from
the
lawyer
was
--
was
not
to
make
sure
that
there
were
no
patents.
it
was
to
show
that
opinion
to
montgomery
ward.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
practical
matter,
you
needed
an
opinion
from
a
lawyer,
because
otherwise,
montgomery
ward
was
not
going
to
sell
this
stuff.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
more
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
before
you
go
--
before
you
go
further,
what
if
you
do
that,
okay?
and
you
get
an
opinion
from
a
lawyer,
as
they
did
here,
saying
you're
not
violating
any
copyright
or
any
--
any
patent?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
you
have
to
tell
the
searcher
that
you
copied.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
part
of
your
test,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
briefs
--
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
this
case
points
out
that
that
argument
is
a
lot
less
plausible
in
copyright
than
it
is
in
--
in
patents.
it
is
very
easy
to
find
out
whether
you're
infringing
a
copyright.
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
out
whether
you're
infringing
a
patent,
especially
in
the
modern
age
of
warehouse
patents.
i
am
not
sure
that
we
--
that
we
want
to
use
the
same
test
for
copyrights
that
we
use
for
--
for
patents.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine.
i
am
just
--
i
am
just
expressing
reservations
about
your
suggestion
that
we
simply
take
grokster
wholesale
and
apply
it
to
this
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
not
interested
in
what
happened
here.
i
mean,
we
are
still
talking
about
a
general
test.
