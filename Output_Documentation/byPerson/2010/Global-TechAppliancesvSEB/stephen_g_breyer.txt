justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
say,
i
am
not
certain
that
willful
blindness
would
support
the
conclusion
below.
the
standard,
the
district
court
or
the
trial
court
said
really,
negligence,
as
i
read
it.
the
circuit
said
deliberate
disregard
of
a
known
risk.
well,
how
much
of
a
risk?
i
mean,
the
business
world
there
is
always
a
risk
and
we
are
talking
about
a
complicated
world,
probably
quite
a
lot
of
risk.
and
so
i
think
that
standard
would
create
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty.
willful
blindness
has
a
tradition.
so
are
you
okay
with
willful
blindness
and
we
say
we
are
afraid
they
did
not
do
it,
i.e.,
we
are
afraid,
we
do
not
know
what
they
really
meant
here
and
so
send
it
back
and
do
it
again.
i
am
sure
you
wouldn't
be
overjoyed.
but
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable
result?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
you
supposed
to
say
known
risk,
sure
he
says
he
looked
at
five.
and
he
says
anybody
can
figure
this
thing
out,
all
you
do
is
put
the
little
gizmos
between
the
two
sides,
you
know,
and
you
have
an
inside
and
outside
and
you
just
suspend
the
inside
with
little
bars
of
some
kind.
i
do
not
know
what,
chewing
gum
or
something,
and
he
says
anybody
could
figure
that
out,
it
couldn't
possibly
be
bad.
and
so
that
is
their
view,
but
how
much
of
a
risk,
they
will
say
little
risk,
big
risk.
so
you
see
why
i
think
we
should
send
it
back.
now
you
tell
me
why
that
is
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
am
not
saying
they
are
right
in
that,
i
bet
they
would
lose.
but
my
problem
is
do
i
accept
the
words
deliberate
disregard
of
the
known
risk
or
do
i
say
the
more
traditional
accompaniment
to
knowledge
is
willful
blindness,
which
for
all
its
obscurity,
at
least
has
a
history.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
that
is
the
part
they
are
complaining
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
difference,
they
say,
between
(b)
and
(c)
is
that
(c)
applies
to
a
person
who
makes
some
really
special
thing
that
looks
like
a
japanese
kabuki
theater
costume,
and
it's
actually
made
out
of
metal
and
it's
really
--
has
a
very
bizarre
thing,
and
it
is
only
used
--
good
use
is
to
do
this
infringing
thing.
but
(b)
could
apply
to
somebody
who
makes
plastic
shields.
(b)
can
apply
that
--
(b)
could
apply
to
anybody
who
makes
anything;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
argument
is
that
the
words
"actively
induced"
are
meant
to
be
something
greater
than
knowing,
not
something
less
than
knowing.
because
otherwise,
you're
going
to
hold
aluminum
company
of
america,
if
that
still
exists,
liable
when
it
makes
these
aluminum
sheets,
because
somebody
uses
an
aluminum
sheet
apparently,
et
cetera.
you
see
the
problem.
it
is
quite
different
when
you
make
this
weird
kabuki-looking
thing
that
only
has
one
use,
and
they
--
and
that's
why
it
should
be
--
it
should
be
harder
to
hold
that
person
to
contributory
infringement,
not
easier.
now,
that's
their
argument.
what
do
you
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
to
get,
really,
an
answer
from
you
on
justice
kennedy's
question,
because
at
the
moment
i
am
not
worried
about
your
case.
you,
of
course,
are.
i
understand
that.
but
the
--
i
am
worried
about
alcoa
or
the
little
backyard
maker
of
clay
pots,
or
--
i
mean,
millions
and
millions
of
people
make
things
that
are
used
in
millions
and
millions
of
ways.
and
i
am
worried
about
what
kind
of
burden
we
are
supposed
to
impose
on
them.
i
see
three
candidates.
one
is,
you're
liable
if
you
should
have
known.
two
is,
you're
liable
if
you
consciously
disregarded
a
--
a
risk,
a
known
risk;
that
is
sort
of
like
a
--
you
know,
the
model
penal
code,
sort
of.
and
third
is
willful
blindness.
is
there
a
fourth?
and
if
there
is
not,
what
do
you
choose
among
those
three?
no,
not
what
you
choose.
what
should
we
choose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
that
--
is
that
another
standard?
maybe
that
is
an
example
of
what
it
is
to
be
willfully
blind.
if,
in
fact,
you
go
out
and
you
copy
something,
it
could
well
be
patented,
and
you
do
not
tell
your
lawyer,
go
look
up
this
one,
that
is
willfully
blind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
why
you
say
they
are
the
same.
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
where
i
am.
at
the
moment,
the
should
have
known
or
willful
blindness,
the
disregard
--
the
problem,
and
it
seems
like
a
real
problem,
is
know
what,
exactly?
well,
know
there
is
a
risk.
well,
at
that
point
half
the
country
in
the
business
world
is
very
upset
because
there
is
always
a
risk.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
other
problem
is
if
you
--
as
you
move
away
from
that
and
say,
no,
no,
i
mean
a
real
risk
--
i
mean
a
huge
risk
--
i
mean
a
risk
that
in
fact,
you
almost
knew
that
this
was
it
--
now
i
can
do
it
with
my
tone
of
voice,
but
i
need
the
words
to
put
in
there
that
are
going
to
calm
people's
fears
that
they
are
not
suddenly
going
to
be
held
liable
because
there
is
some
fairly
small
risk
of
this.
so
what
words
would
i
use?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
this
case;
i
am
not
worried
about.
i
am
worried
about
what
i
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
do
not
want
to
just
resolve
the
case.
[laughter]
the
reason
we
took
the
case
is
because
there
seemed
a
bunch
of
standards
floating
around.
now
i
know
our
interests
differ
in
this
matter,
but
i
would
appreciate
any
help
you
can
give
me
about
what
i
am
thinking
now
is
words
that
will
quantify
the
risk
that
you
had
to
have
known
about,
a
risk;
so
that
it
doesn't
look
like
some
small
thing
that
is
always
there
that
looks
like
some
giant
thing
that
is
pretty
close
to
actually--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
i've
heard
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it
would.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--my
problem,
is
a
high
probability
that.
you
have
to
be
--
you
have
to
consciously,
that
is
the
model
penal
code,
that
is
the
--
you
know,
torts
--
you
have
to
consciously
disregard
a
high
probability
that
this
item
was
patented
and
also
meet
the
other
requirements
that
are
part
of
active
inducement.
that
is
what
your
thought
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
your
client
doesn't
care.
but
still
we
have
to
write
this.
so
what
about
the
answer?
to
follow
it
up
a
little
bit,
it
is
knowledge
--
you're
familiar
with
these
areas,
so
you're
helpful,
and
--
and
it
is
a
knowledge
or
a
known
--
or
consciously
disregarding
a
known
risk
where
the
risk
consists
of
a
high
probability
that
that
item
that
you
are
inducing
to
be
produced
will
infringe
a
patent.
