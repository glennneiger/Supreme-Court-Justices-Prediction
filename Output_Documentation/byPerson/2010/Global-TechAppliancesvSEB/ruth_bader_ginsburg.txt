justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
that
the
particular
patent
--
the
defendant
would
have
to
know
that
the
device
infringed
the
particular
patent.
i
think
that
would
be
a
standard
that
would
be
impossible
to
meet.
we
have
to
know
if
it
was
patent
number,
whatever
it
was,
'312.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
can
keep
yourself
ignorant
of
it.
i
mean,
for
example,
you
pointed
out
that
the
--
that
the
device
that
was
copied
was
purchased
in
hong
kong,
so
it
didn't
have
any
marking,
but
the
same
pentalpha
could
have
bought
the
device
in
montgomery
ward,
looked
to
see
if
it
had
a
patent
marking;
didn't
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
tell
that
patent
attorney
that
they
had
reverse-engineered
a
particular
product.
if
the
attorney
had
been
told
this
device
copied
the
seb
fryer,
isn't
it
99
and
44/100ths
percent
sure
that
the
attorney
then
would
have
found
this
patent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
didn't
ask
you
about
this
patent
search.
i
said
if
they
had
told
the
patent
attorney
we
have
copied
a
particular
fryer,
it's
seb's
fryer,
now
find
out
if
it
infringed
any
patent
--
do
you
think
an
attorney
would
not
have
found
the
seb
patent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
really
wanted
to
know,
wouldn't
you
have
gone
into
montgomery
ward
and
bought
one
of
the
fryers
and
turned
it
around
to
see
if
it
had
a
patent
number
on
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
--
isn't
it
true
that
sunbeam
was
the
party
that
asked
for
the
patent
search?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
says
who
--
who
asked
pentalpha--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
get
--
to
get
a
letter?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
--
before
you
pass
that
question,
then
why
as
in
'607
did
they
pick
the
seb
fryer
to
reverse-engineer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
they
copied
the
design
of
the
seb.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
a
finding
that
it
was
an
infringement,
that
the
pentalpha
fryer
infringed
the
seb.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
cruz?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
dealing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they're
dealing
with
a
federal
circuit
decision,
they're
reviewing
that
decision,
the
federal
circuit
had
a
formula.
it
said
standard
is
deliberate
disregard
of
a
known
risk.
one
thing
you
must
surely
do
is
to
say
whether
that
standard
is
right
or
wrong.
so
the
federal
circuit,
whatever
the
jury
found,
federal
circuit
said
the
law
is
that
you
are
liable
under
271(b)
if
you
are
deliberately
--
if
you
deliberately
disregard
a
known
risk.
is
that
standard
the
right
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
after
that
date
you
admit
you
--
because
you
continued
to
sell
the
product
to
the
retailers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
after
sunbeam
sued,
then
you
are
actively
inducing
infringement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
opinion
was
after
the
first
finding
of
infringement,
that
you
redesigned
the
product
and
that,
the
evidence
you
got
dealt
with
the
redesigned
products.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
after
just
originally,
sunbeam
is
suing
for
infringement.
sunbeam
notifies
pentalpha.
at
that
point,
pentalpha
is
continuing
to
make
sales.
is
it
infringing?
is
it
actively
inducing
infringement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
admitted
there
was
purposeful,
culpable
conduct
when
you
did
not,
when
you
had
the
original
design
and
that
was,
and
you
were
sued
for
actively
inducing
infringement
of
that
design,
by
that
design.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
think
a
jury
could
have
found
that
from
the
facts?
