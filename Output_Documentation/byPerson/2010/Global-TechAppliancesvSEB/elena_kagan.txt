justice
elena
kagan
mr.
dunnegan,
suppose
i
disagree
with
you
on
that,
and
suppose
i
think
that
actual
knowledge
of
a
patent
or
willful
blindness
as
to
whether
a
patent
exists
is
the
right
standard.
could
a
reasonable
jury
have
found
that
in
this
case?
justice
elena
kagan
a
reasonable
jury
couldn't
have
looked
at
the
facts
that
justice
ginsburg
suggested
--
you
know,
you
do
not
tell
the
lawyer
that
you,
in
fact,
have
copied
the
product
and
say
that's
--
a
reasonable
jury
--
that's
willful
blindness.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
dunnegan,
could
i
take
you
to
the
standard?
because
in
aro
ii
we
said
that
the
appropriate
standard
in
subsection
(c)
was
actual
knowledge.
why
shouldn't
we
just
say
it's
the
same?
whether
it
is
(b)
or
(c),
these
are
just
two
means
of
--
of
doing
a
contributory
infringement,
and
the
knowledge/willful
blindness
standard,
once
we've
said
it
applies
to
(c),
it
applies
to
(b)
as
well?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
(b)
and
(c)
have
different
standards
as
to
--
not
the
knowledge
of
the
patent
but
--
but
what
the
person
is
--
the
acts
that
constitute
infringement.
but
that's
a
different
thing
from
whether
they
should
have
different
standards
as
to
the
knowledge
of
the
patent.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
dunnegan,
in
grokster,
there
was
no
question
as
to
whether
they
knew
that
the
--
that
the
things
were
copyrighted.
justice
elena
kagan
so
why
is
grokster
relevant
here?
they
conceded
the
very
thing
that
we're
arguing
over.
justice
elena
kagan
so
would
you
have
any
objection
to
an
actual
knowledge
willful
blindness
standard?
would
that
be
all
right
with
you?
justice
elena
kagan
i
take
it
that
we
would
do
that
on
the
basis
of
aro
ii?
we
would
just
say
that's
the
standard
for
(c)
and
that
should
be
the
statement
for
(b)?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
271(c)
includes
the
word
knowing,
you
have
to
know
that
an
item
has
no
noninfringing
uses.
that
is
a
different
kind
of
knowledge
than
the
knowledge
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
justice
elena
kagan
and
because
of
the
infringement,
but
not
necessarily
that
there
was
a
patent,
not
necessarily
the
legal
effect
as
opposed
to
the
act.
justice
elena
kagan
why
aren't
you
both
wrong,
that
grokster
didn't
deal
with
the
question
that
we
are
dealing
with,
which
was
knowledge
of
a
patent
or
knowledge
of
a
copyright,
that
grokster
dealt
with
whether
there
was
specific
intent
or
whether
there
needed
to
be
specific
intent
to
encourage
infringing
acts.
that
is
what
grokster
was
about,
an
entirely
separate
question.
