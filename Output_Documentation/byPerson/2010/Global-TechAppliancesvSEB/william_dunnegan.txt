mr.
william
dunnegan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
standard
for
the
state
of
mind
element
for
a
claim
for
inducing
patent
infringement
should
be:
did
the
accused
inducer
have
a
purpose
to
induce
a
third
party
to
engage
in
acts
that
the
accused
inducer
knew
infringed
the
patent?
that's
what
i'll
call
the
purposeful,
culpable
test.
the
federal
circuit
applied
a
standard
of
whether
pentalpha
was
deliberately
indifferent
to
a
known
risk
that
a
patent
may
exist.
the
federal
circuit's
deliberate
indifference
test
was
not
a
willful
blindness
test.
willful
blindness
would
have
required
both
an
awareness
of
a
high
probability
that
a
patent
would
exist
and
a
deliberate
effort
to
avoid
learning
the
truth.
mr.
william
dunnegan
your
honor,
deliberate
indifference
would
not
fall--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--no,
your
honor.
willful
blindness
would
not
fall
within
our
purposeful,
culpable
test.
mr.
william
dunnegan
willful
blindness
in
not
a
purpose,
your
honor.
mr.
william
dunnegan
well,
you
wouldn't
have
to
know
the
patent
number,
your
honor,
but
what
you
would
have
to
know
is
that
your
--
the
product
which
you
are
inducing
a
third
party
to
make,
use,
or
sell
would
be
within
the
scope
of
a
--
of
the
claims
of
a
particular
patent.
if
you
don't
know
that,
then
you're
literally--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--it
didn't
do
that,
your
honor.
what
it
did
was
better.
it
hired
a
united
states
patent
attorney
to
conduct
a
search
to
see
if
there
was
any
patent
which
was
infringed.
mr.
william
dunnegan
we
don't
know,
your
honor.
we
don't
know
why
the
patent
search
failed.
it
could
have
failed
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
william
dunnegan
it's
possible
that
he
wouldn't
have.
maybe
it's
more
probable
that
he
would
have.
there's
just
no
evidence
on
that
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
william
dunnegan
your
honor,
maybe
that's
what
you
would
have
done.
maybe
that's
what
i
would
have
done,
but
there's
no
--
but
the
standard
of
that
business
--
what
they
had
done
in
the
past
was
to
give
their
design
drawings
to
the
patent
attorney
and
say
objectively
check
these
design
drawings.
their
practice
was
not
to
notify
the
attorney.
mr.
william
dunnegan
yes--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--your
honor,
looking
back
at
this
in
hindsight,
there's
--
there's
no
question
that
if
they
had
to
do
it
again,
they
would
have
taken
the
additional
step.
but--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--no
--
well,
from
an
objective
perspective,
your
honor,
if
you're
giving
the
design
to
the
--
to
the
attorney
and
you're
saying
do
a
complete
search,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
antithesis
of
being
willful
blind,
because
you're
hiring
a
specialist
to
go
out
and
look
for
the
answer
for
you.
now,
the
gold
standard
was
not
met,
but
the
gold
standard
would
rarely
be
met
in
any
of
these
cases.
mr.
william
dunnegan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
dunnegan
well,
i
would
disagree
in
that
situation,
because
most
probably
the
knowledge
of
the
attorney
in
that
situation,
because
he
has
been
hired
by
the
client,
would
be
imputed
to
the
client.
so
i
could
see
a
different
result
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
posited.
mr.
william
dunnegan
well,
your
honor,
right
now,
under
--
under
the
seagate
case
in
the
federal
circuit,
there
is
no
inducement
to
go
get
a
patent
search.
under
the
seagate
decision,
if
a
party--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
is
willful
blindness
as
a
matter
of
law.
willful
blindness
under
the
--
under
the
santos
standard
has
two
distinct
elements.
one
would
be
that
there's
a
high
probability
that
there
would
have
been
a
patent
on
that
particular
product.
mr.
william
dunnegan
yes,
you
can,
your
honor.
mr.
william
dunnegan
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
william
dunnegan
we
don't
know
for
sure,
but
the
probability
would
be
greater
than
50
percent,
your
honor.
mr.
william
dunnegan
purpose.
mr.
william
dunnegan
yes.
the
--
well,
i
think
to
answer
the
question
presented
in
a
cert
petition,
you
really
need
to
determine
what
the
standard
is.
now,
i
think
we
can
also
decide
that
it
should
not
be
--
or
we
can
agree
that
it
should
not
be
a
deliberate
indifference
to
a
known
risk
that
a
patent
exists,
because
that
would
be
met
in
virtually
every
situation
where
there
was
not
actual
knowledge
of
a
patent.
mr.
william
dunnegan
let
me
explain
to
you
why
your
--
why
the
language
of
the
statute
should
not
support
the
interpretation
which
your
honor
just
gave.
let's
begin
with
the
word
"induces".
"induces"
connotes
some
degree
of
intent,
arguably.
mr.
cruz
agrees
with
that
at
page
20
of
his
brief.
if
you
put
the
word
"actively"
in
front
of
the
word
"induces",
then
you
have
a
heightened
intent
standard--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--exactly,
your
honor.
that
brings
you
to
the
word
"infringement"
in
the
statute.
now,
i
think
it's
critical
that
(b)
uses
the
word
"infringement".
it
does
not
go
back
to
(a)
and
say
anyone
who
actively
induces
the
making,
using,
selling
of
a
patent
device
is
an
infringer.
mr.
william
dunnegan
because
those
are
the
acts,
your
honor.
if
congress's
intent
had
been
to
say
we
only
want
to
induce
acts,
it
would
seem
to
me
the
clearest
way
they
could
say
that
is
to
say
"making,
using,
or
selling.
"
if
they
wanted
to
create
a
standard
which
was
inducing
the
actual
infringement
of
a
patent,
as
opposed
to
the
acts
which
constitute
the
infringement,
then
they
use
the
word
"infringement".
mr.
william
dunnegan
that's
not
necessarily
clear,
your
honor.
when
you
look
at
18
u.s.c.
section
2,
there's
very
little
case
law
dealing
with
strict
liability
offense
and
inducements
of
those.
we
have
been
able
to
identify
one
sixth
circuit
case
from
1989
which
deals
with
the
issue,
and
in
that
case,
it
holds
that
there's
actually
a
purpose
to
--
a
purpose
to
cause
the
underlying
crime
or
violation,
not
necessarily
strict
liability,
not
strict
liability.
mr.
william
dunnegan
i--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--no,
please,
your
honor.
mr.
william
dunnegan
if
there
is
an
area
--
for
example,
semiconductors,
where
some
amici
have
stated
that
there's
--
there's
420,000
patents
dealing
with
semiconductors.
and
you
know
that,
and
you
know
that
if
you
do
virtually
anything,
and
especially
if
you
copy,
you're
going
to
hit
a
semiconductor
patent
owned
by
somebody,
i
think
that,
in
that
rare
situation,
knowledge
that
you're
infringing
someone's
intellectual
property
rights
should
probably
be
enough
of
a
--
of
a
directed
intent.
if
you
--
that
would
be
the
basis
for
inferring
a
purpose.
but
here,
we
have
to--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--no.
no,
your
honor.
if
you
copied
a
semiconductor
and
you
knew
that
there
were
420,000
patents
that
were
unexpired
out
there,
that
would
make
it
--
if
you
didn't
do
your
--
your
diligence,
perhaps--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--that
is
very,
very
true,
your
honor.
and
even
in
the
--
in
the
deep-fryer
industry,
it
is
going
to
be
different,
because
there's
very
few
--
i
mean,
compared
to
semiconductors--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--agreed.
mr.
william
dunnegan
completely
agreed.
mr.
william
dunnegan
that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
[laughter]
that's
exactly
correct.
and
on
balance
--
i
think
there's
one
point
that
i
should
make
sooner
rather
than
later,
and
it's
is
the
standard
that
i'm
--
the
standard
that
we
are
proposing
is
not
unique
to
us.
it's
the
--
it's
the
standard
that
grokster
developed.
and
with
respect
to
willful
blindness,
we
believe
that
the
standard
--
the
balance
was
already
struck,
and
it
was
struck
in
favor
of
eliminating
a
willful
blindness
standard.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--we
don't
think
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
have
found
willful
blindness
because,
first
of
all,
there
wasn't
a
high
probability
that
a
patent
would
be
found.
second,
we
do
not
think
that
there
was
active--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
what
we
have
done
in
that
situation
was,
first,
we
have
done
more
than
the
law
required.
we
went
out
to
get
a
patent.
we
gave
the
lawyer
our
actual
patent
drawings
and
tell
him
to
do
his
work.
mr.
william
dunnegan
your
honor,
we
have
so
many
products
that
you
couldn't
practically
expect
the
company
to
do
that,
i
don't
think.
mr.
william
dunnegan
but
your
--
your--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--your
honor,
i
take
issue
with
you
for
the
following
reason:
i
don't
think
there
was
any
intention
on
the
part
of
our
client
to
--
to
infringe
a
patent
at
all,
because
if
it
knew
about
the
patent,
it
could
have
designed
around
it
if
it
knew
what
it
was
doing.
there's
no
benefit
to
our
client
of
getting
montgomery
ward
or
sunbeam
or
fingerhut
in
trouble
for
patenting
infringement.
we
really
want
to
know
what
patents
are
out
there.
mr.
william
dunnegan
i
don't
believe
that's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
sunbeam
was
given
a
copy
of
the
patent
search,
but
mr.
sham
testified
--
and
i
believe
this
is
about
at
page
50
of
the
joint
appendix
--
that
the
purpose
of
the
search
was
to
find
out
whether
or
not
there
was
an
infringement
of
any
patent
through
this
deep
fryer.
mr.
william
dunnegan
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
william
dunnegan
okay.
i
think
you'd
need
two
things,
your
honor.
the
first
that
you
would
need
is
evidence
that
they
were
going
to
bump
into
a
patent
if
they
--
if
they
proceeded.
is
there
the
high
probability
of
finding
a
patent?
now,
if
you
--
if
you
just
consciously
avoid
knowledge
in
the
absence
of
a
high
probability,
that's
not
willful
blindness.
that's
not
even
culpable.
mr.
william
dunnegan
no,
i
--
well,
is
there--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--your
honor,
the
record
is
that
there
were
six
or
so
deep
fryers
which
were
the
cool-touch
deep
fryers
which
they
--
which
they
used
as
references.
seb
was
not
the
only
cool-touch
deep
fryer
that
was
available.
now,
to
turn
back
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
grokster
actually
found
that
willful--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--they
reverse
--
they
looked
at
all
of
them,
your
honor.
they
reverse-engineered
all
of
them.
if
you
look
at--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--actually,
your
honor,
they
improved
it.
there's
functional
features
that
went
beyond
and
were
better
than
what
were
in
the
seb
product.
for
example,
they
used
better
metal
to
make
the
cast
iron
pan.
they
put
the--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--the
jury
did
find
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
dunnegan
the
reason
that
you
shouldn't
take
the
standard
from
(c)
is
because
(c)
deals
with
nonstaples
and
(b)
deals
with
staples.
someone
can
be
liable
under
(b)
if
they
--
if
they
sell
a
staple
article
of
commerce,
when
they
can't
be
libel
under
(c),
even
if
they
meet
--
even
if
they
meet
the
higher
--
even
they
meet
the
state
of
mind
element
under
(c),
which
is
knowing
the
patent
and
knowing
that
the
combination
would
be
an
infringement.
therefore,
to
make
sure
that
(b)
does
not
swallow
(c),
it's
very
important
that
(b)
have
a
higher
state
of
mind.
mr.
william
dunnegan
well,
when
you
say
there's
different
standards,
the
sale
of
an
--
of
a
staple
article
under
(b)
in
itself
with
a
proper
state
of
mind
can
be
an
inducement.
the
sale
of
a
nonstaple
article
with
certain
additional
conditions
can
be
a
violation
of
(c).
the
action
element
for
(b)
and
(c)
is
--
is
essentially
the
same
for
the
sale
of
components,
and
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
to
raise
it
for
(b)
because
all
you
would
be
doing
in
that
situation
is
--
is
encompassing
sellers
that
were
helping
their
customers
do
business
more
effectively,
and
you
wouldn't
be
getting
any
more
bad
guys.
the
purpose
of
(b)
is
let's
get
the
morally
culpable
actors.
now--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--no,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--i
would
think
you
have
to
go
with
the
grokster
standard,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
one,
in
grokster
you
found
what
the
state
of
mind
standard
was
for
inducing
infringement
under
(b),
and
you
moved
that
into
the
copyright
law.
then,
under
the--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--that
was
conceded
in
that
case,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
william
dunnegan
well,
it's
--
it's
--
it's
relevant
because
it
deals
with
the
standard
what
is
--
what
is
the
state
of
mind
element
for
inducing
copyright
infringement.
mr.
william
dunnegan
purposeful,
culpable
conduct
--
yes.
mr.
william
dunnegan
knowing,
well
--
the
way
i
understand
knowing,
your
honor,
is
that
in
sony,
for
example,
there
was
no
liability
even
though
sony
knew
that
some
people
were
going
to
use
the
vcr
to
infringe
copyrighted
works.
that
was
collateral
damage
even
though
they
knew
it;
it
wasn't
the
basis
for
liability.
in
grokster,
the
basis
for
liability
was
even
though
the
defendant
knew
that
there
were
going
to
be
some
infringements,
it
couldn't
be
liable
for
contributory
copyright
infringement,
the
equivalent
of
271(c),
because
there
was
substantial
noninfringing
uses
for
the
grokster
software.
grokster
was
--
was
allowed
to
be
found
liable
because
the
defendants
had
a
--
a
culpable
objective
--
they
had
a
culpable
purpose,
or
at
least
a
jury
could
so
find,
that
they
wanted
to
encourage
infringements.
mr.
william
dunnegan
your
honor,
i
believe
the
first
sentence
of
your
question
was
if
you
knew
that
there
was
a
patent.
is
that
a
hypothetical?
mr.
william
dunnegan
okay.
if
we
knew
that
there
was
a
patent
and
we
knew
the
claims
of
the
patent
and
we
read
them
and
we--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--no.
mr.
william
dunnegan
because
it
should
be
--
it
should
be
higher.
it
should
be
the
grokster
standard
of
purposeful,
culpable
conduct.
and
--
me
the
reason
for
that--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--okay.
mr.
william
dunnegan
because,
your
honor,
if
--
you
could
or
you
could
not
be,
depending
on
what
your
purpose
is
with
respect
to
infringement.
if
you
had
a
legal
opinion
which
told
you
that
the
sale
of
that
product
would
not
infringe
the
patent,
then
you
wouldn't
have
a
purposeful--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--well,
not
exactly,
your
honor,
because
if
you're
reaching
the
conclusion
that
the
product
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
claims
of
the
patent,
i
don't
think
that's
law.
that's
fact.
the
reason
it's
not
law
is
that
--
it
couldn't
be
repealed.
it's
--
you
can't
pass
a
law
abrogating
a
patent.
mr.
william
dunnegan
a
mistake
of
law
--
generally
you
don't
get
off
the
hook.
what
we
have
here
is
a
mistake
of
fact
concerning
the
scope
of
the
claim
of
the
patent.
now,
granted,
under--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--yes,
we
would,
your
honor.
let's
take
the
situation
that
there
was
a
prior
adjudication
that
the
direct
infringer
was
directly
infringing.
let's
take
the
situation
where
there's
going
to
be
advertising
which
references
the
patents,
as
there
was
in
grokster
and
says
go
infringe
it.
let's
take
the
situation
where
there's
internal
documents
at
the
company
suggesting
that
there
is
a
purpose
to
infringe,
as
there
was
in
grokster.
mr.
william
dunnegan
no,
your
honor.
please.
mr.
william
dunnegan
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
william
dunnegan
five
points
in
rebuttal,
i
believe,
your
honor.
the
first
is
what
should
the
standard
be
with
respect
to
willful
blindness.
and
i
do
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
sentence
in
grokster
appearing
at
page
941
of
the
opinion.
and
it
provides,
this
is
worth
reading,
i
believe.
if
liability
for
inducing
infringement
is
ultimately
found,
it
will
not
be
on
the
basis
of
presuming
or
imputing
liability,
excuse
me,
fault,
but
from
inferring
a
patently
illegal
objective
from
statements
and
actions
showing
what
that
objective
was.
now,
in
the
context
of
an
amicus
brief
from
the
solicitor
general
in
that
case
suggesting
a
willful
blindness
standard,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
language
is
a
rejection
of
imputing
a
willful
blindness
standard.
mr.
william
dunnegan
the
test
that
we
are
looking
for
is
the
grokster
test.
is
there
purposeful,
culpable
conduct.
mr.
william
dunnegan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
dunnegan
not
precisely.
we
preserved
other
issues
beyond
that.
we
preserved
both
the
jury
charge
by
objecting
at
135a
of
the
joint
appendix
and
we
objected
to
the
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
motion
by
making
it
and
saying
specifically
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
there
was
actual
knowledge
of
the
patent
before
april
9th
of
1998.
now--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
dunnegan
no,
your
honor.
at
that
point
we
have
actual
knowledge
of
the
patent
and
the
analysis
has
to
go
to
what
was
our
purpose.
for
the
bulk
of
that
period
of
time,
we
had
a
legal
opinion
from
a
very
competent
new
york
city
lawyer
stating
that
we
did
not
infringe.
and
the
jury,
i
guess
the
second
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
the
jury
never
evaluated
any
standard
higher
than
new
or--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--i
believe
your
timing
is
correct,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--that
is
a
question
of
fact,
your
honor.
the
jury
resolved
it
against
us,
but
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
for
some
period
of
time
after
that
we
had
a
legal
opinion
saying
we
did
not
infringe
and
we
believe
that
legal
opinion
from
the
new
york
city
attorney
would
prevent
or
should
prevent,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
finding
of
purposeful,
culpable
conduct.
now,
the
second
standard
i
wanted
to
address
was--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--no,
your
honor.
we
would
never
concede
that
we
were
purposefully--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--yes.
we
are
not
seeking
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
for
any
claims
that
arose
after
april
of
1998
when
we
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
patent,
only
before
we
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
patent
are
we
seeking
judgement
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
going
to
the
issue
of
whether
willful
blindness
could
be
found
by
the
failure
of
someone
to
tell
the
patent
attorney
that
there
was
a
copying--
mr.
william
dunnegan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
dunnegan
yes,
your
honor.
that's
our
primary
argument,
but
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
willful
blindness
as
being
enough,
then
i
would
question
whether
or
not
simply
not
telling
the
patent
attorney
what
references
were
used
or
even
which
ones
were
copied
would
be
enough.
because
in
that
situation,
the
company
has
taken
an
effort
to
find
out
what
the
truth
is
and
it
simply
failed
to
meet
the
gold
standard
in
meeting
that
obligation.
