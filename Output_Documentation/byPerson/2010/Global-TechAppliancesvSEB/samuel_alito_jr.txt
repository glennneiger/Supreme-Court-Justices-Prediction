justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
your
position
is
that
even
willful
blindness
is
not
enough.
you
have
to
have
actual
knowledge
that
--
that
the
item
is
patented,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
the
attorney
had
called
up
your
client
and
said,
i
have
an
answer
for
you,
and
the
client
said,
well,
you
know
what,
on
second
thought,
i
really
don't
want
to
know,
because
if
i
--
if
i
have
actual
knowledge,
that
may
put
me
in
a
box;
so
forget
about
it.
then
there's
no
liability.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
i
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
see
no
scienter
requirement
whatsoever.
whoever
actively
induces
infringement
of
the
patent
--
infringement
is
strict
liability.
so
if
you
actively
induce
somebody
to
engage
in
conduct
constituting
infringement,
you're
--
you're
liable
as
an
inducer.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
have
intent,
but
intent
to
do
what?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
difference
does
that
make?
because
making,
using,
and
selling
equals
infringement.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
see
that.
and
not
only
that,
i
don't
understand
why
the
scienter
requirement
for
inducing
should
be
higher
than
the
scienter
requirement
for
a
direct
infringement.
isn't
the
standard
rule
for
aiding
and
abetting
that
the
aider
and
abetter
--
if
(b)
is
an
aiding
and
abetting
provision,
as
one
of
the
congressional
reports
said,
the
--
the
scienter
for
aiding
and
abetting
is
the
scienter
of
the
underlying
offense?
so
if
the
underlying
offense
is
a
strict
liability
offense,
then
the
inducement
should
be
strict
liability
as
well.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
this
is
not
willful
blindness,
i
don't
know
what
willful
blindness
is.
now,
maybe
you
can
explain
what
more
would
have
been
required
to
permit
a
reasonable
jury
to
find
willful
blindness.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
your
client
--
i
don't
know
whether
you're
using
your
time
most
effectively
by
arguing
this
point,
but
your
client
thought
that
making
a
deep
fryer
that
wouldn't
burn
people's
hands
if
they
touched
it
would
be
profitable,
because
there
wasn't
a
lot
of
competition
in
that
market.
this
was
a
useful
product
and
apparently
one
that
was
different
from
other
deep
fryers.
isn't
that
in
itself
--
doesn't
that
in
itself
suggest,
gee,
there
might
be
a
patent
on
--
on
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
one
company
is
making
this
and
it
seems
to
be
better
than
what
the
other
companies
are
making;
maybe
it
might
be
patented.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
cruz,
while
we
are
certainly
interested
in
what
the
standard
should
be.
but
in
terms
of
the
deposition
of
this
case,
maybe
you
could
help
me
with
this.
the
--
the
instruction
to
which
there
was
an
objection
on,
124a
to
--
well,
wherever
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
--
was
the
newer
should
have
known,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
objection
that
i
see
was
that
the
words
"or
should
have
known
that
their
actions.
"
--this
is
135a
of
the
joint
appendix
--
should
have
been
stricken.
so
am
i
right
that
the
only
issue
that
was
preserved
is
the
question
whether
actual
knowledge
was
required?
because
that
was
the
only
--
that
was
what
--
that
was
the
error,
the
alleged
error
that
was
identified
by
mr.
dunnegan.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
he
is
wrong
on
that,
then
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you
want
actual
knowledge
of
the
patent?
that
is
your
test?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
want
actual
knowledge
of
the
patent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that
is
the
issue
you
preserved
with
your
objection?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
involves
a
question
of
patent
laws
specifically
the
intent
that
is
quite
--
required
for
a
violation
of
the
provision
of
the
patent
act
which
prohibits
a
party
from
actively
inducing
another
party
to
commit
infringement.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
whom
we
will
call
pentalpha
argue
that
a
party
cannot
be
held
liable
unless
the
party
has
actual
knowledge
that
the
induced
acts
will
constitute
infringement
which
requires
knowledge
of
patenting
question.
the
federal
circuit
on
the
other
hand,
held
that
it
is
enough
if
a
party
should've
known
that
the
induced
acts
will
constitute
infringement.
now,
the
facts
of
the
case
are
relatively
simple.
the
respondent
in
this
case,
seb,
designed
a
cool-touch
deep
fryer
and
obtained
a
u.s.
patent.
now
this
product
as
the
name
suggests
was
a
deep
fryer
manufactured
for
home
use
with
an
exterior
that
would
remain
cool
when
it
was
touched
during
operation
even
though
the
oil
inside
was
boiling.
this
was
a
successful
product
and
pentalpha
decided
to
copy
it
and
produce
it
for
sale
in
the
united
states.
it
could've
sent
somebody
to
any
store
in
the
united
states
where
this
was
sold
to
look
at
the
seb
fryer
and
see
that
whether
there
was
a
u.s.
patent
label
on
the
back
but
it
didn't
do
that.
it
purchased
one
of
the
seb
fryers
in
hong
kong
knowing
that
a
product
manufactured
for
sale
outside
the
united
states
would
be
unlikely
to
have
a
u.s.
patent
label
and
sure
enough,
this
product
did
not
have
a
u.s.
patent
label.
it
then
copied
the
seb
fryer
in
all
respects
other
than
some
cosmetic
respects
and
prepared
to
market
it
in
the
united
states.
but
before
it
did
that,
it
hired
a
lawyer
in
the
united
states
to
do
a
patent
search.
it
failed
to
tell
the
lawyer
one
very
important
fact,
namely
that
it
had
copied
the
seb
fryer.
now,
had
it
done
that,
presumably,
the
lawyer
would've
found
the
seb
patent.
but
without
that
information,
the
lawyer
did
not
find
the
patent
and
sent
a
letter
to
pentalpha
saying
that
its
product
would
not
infringe
a
u.s.
patent.
now,
turning
back
to
the
legal
issue
in
the
case,
the
--
the
federal
circuit,
we
hold,
went
too
far
in
concluding
that
it
is
enough
if
a
party
should've
known
that
the
acts
induced
would
constitute
infringement.
based
largely
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
1964
case
called
aro
ii,
we
hold
that
the
statutory
provision
in
question
here
requires
knowledge
that
the
induced
acts
constitute
infringement
but
we
also
hold
that
an
old
and
sensible
doctrine
called
the
doctrine
of
willful
blindness
applies.
this
doctrine
means
that
a
party
who
may
be
liable
if
it
knows
a
fact,
cannot
escape
liability
by
deliberately
taking
acts
to
shield
itself
from
direct
actual
knowledge
of
facts
that
it
knows
are
very
likely
to
be
true,
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
this
case
really
provides
a
textbook
example
of
willful
blindness.
and
we
therefore
hold
that
pentalpha
was
properly
held
libel
for
inducing
infringement.
the
judgment
of
the
federal
circuit
is
therefore
affirmed.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
