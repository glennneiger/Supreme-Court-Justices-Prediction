justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
didn't
we
take
this
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
deliberate
indifference
is
the
standard?
i
mean,
willful
blindness
--
i
don't
think
an
opinion
for
this
court
has
ever
sustained.
santos
was
a
judgment
--
was
not
a
majority
opinion.
that's
just
a
subset
of
knowledge.
if
we
leave
that
out
from
it,
isn't
the
dichotomy
that
you
present
to
us
the
difference
between
deliberate
indifference
and
knowledge
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
purposeful,
culpable
expression,
the
--
the
grokster
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
thought
that
you
wanted
us
to
take
the
knowing
standard
in
(c)
and
apply
it
to
(b).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
say
it's
purposeful,
culpable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
in
the
red
brief,
the
respondent's
brief,
page
26,
toward
the
bottom
it
says
if
you
find,
i
have
a
problem
that
i
do
not
know
that
they
preserved
this
objection,
but
let's
talk
about
what
the
standard
ought
to
be.
at
the
bottom
it
says,
if
you
find
that
the
someone
has
directly
infringed
a
patent
and
that
the
defendants
knew
or
should
have
known
that
its
actions
would
induce
direct
infringement.
so
this
means
to
me
that
in
order
to
be
liable
for
an
inducement
you
can
be
liable
if
you
knew
or
should
have
known.
now,
if
we
can
just
discuss
this
for
a
moment.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
important
point
in
the
case
because
if
you
say
should
have
known,
then
you
have
a
standard
that
is
less
than
intentional
for
inducers.
and
that
means
that
every
supplier,
every
business
person
that
takes
a
product
from
a
manufacturer
has
the
duty
to
inquire
and
to
find
out
if
there
is
a
patent.
and
it
is
a
standard
that
is
less
than
intentional
and
that
is
a
very
substantial
change
or
a
very
substantial
burden
to
impose
on
those
who
are
selling
and
distributing
products.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
say
should
have
known,
that
is
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
holding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
you
say,
willful
blindness
was
never
used
really
until
this
court
and
this
court
has
never
in
a
full
opinion
for
the
court
adopted
it
even
in
the
criminal
context.
so
can
we
talk
about
knowing
as
opposed
to
should
have
known.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
presenting
to
us
the
proposition,
i
take
it,
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
that
we
should
write
an
opinion
that
is
saying
that
know
or
should
have
known
is
the
standard
for
an
inducer.
and
i
question
whether
that
is
a
wise
interpretation
and
a
necessary
interpretation
of
(b),
especially
as
we
are
informed
through
(c)
as
to
what
(b)
might
mean.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
are
arguing
about
whether
or
not
you
can
protect
your
judgement
based
upon
all
that's
in
the
record,
i
think
you
may
have
a
strong
point.
but
i
am
interested
in
what
the
standard
ought
to
be.
i'd
like
you
to
know
what
a
properly
instructed
jury
should
be
told
with
reference
to
knowledge
or
something
less
than
knowledge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
saying
that
(b)
should
have
a
lesser
standard
of
culpability
than
(c)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
not
immune
from
liability
for
direct
infringement.
you're
immune
from
liability,
under
the
hypothetical,
for
actively
inducing.
and
that
is
where
there
is
a
very
substantial
policy
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
are
you
saying
that
the
standard
of
knowledge
would
be
the
same
for
direct
infringement
as
for
active
inducement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
say,
even
though
you
--
i
think
you
disagree
with
this
in
this
case,
would
you
say
that
there
is
a
reasonable
argument
in
our
precedent
for
saying
that
the
standard
of
knowledge
under
(b)
should
be
greater
than
reckless
disregard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
would
you
say
that
there
is
substantial
authority
for
the
proposition
that
it
should
--
the
state
of
mind
should
be
greater
than
"should
have
known"?
