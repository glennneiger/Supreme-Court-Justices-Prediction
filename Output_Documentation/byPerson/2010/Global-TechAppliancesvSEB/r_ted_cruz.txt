mr.
r.
ted
cruz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
whatever
test
that
this
court
adopts
for
inducing
infringement,
the
central
objective
of
that
test
will
be
to
separate
culpable
bad
actors
from
innocent
corporate
behavior
actors.
and
by
any
measure,
pentalpha
in
this
case
was
a
culpable
bad
actor.
in
fact,
we've
got
really
extraordinary
testimony
in
this
case--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
think
that
is
one
of
multiple
standards
this
court
could
adopt
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
actual
knowledge.
i
do
not
think
actual
knowledge
is
in
the
statute,
but
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
actual
knowledge
and
conclude
also
that
willful
blindness
is
a
long-recognized
means
of
demonstrating
actual
knowledge,
that
would
support
the
judgment.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
respectfully,
justice
kagan,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
an
interpretation
that
is
faithful
to
the
text
of
271.
there
is
an
enormous
difference
between
271(c)
and
271(b).
271(c)
includes
the
word
knowing.
271(b)
does
not
include
the
word
knowing
and
your
question
assumes
essentially--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--respectfully,
in
aro
ii
what
the
court
did
and
it
was,
as
you
know,
a
splintered
majority
in
aro
ii
where
the
dissenters
flipped
back
and
forth,
but
with
the
particular
paragraph
that
addressed
the
holding
on
what
had
to
be
demonstrated,
the
court
concluded
that
that
word
knowing
effectively
modified
both
the
knowledge
that
the
nonstaple
article
had
no
noninfringing
use
and,
and
that
it
would
cause
the
infringement.
that
is
how
the
court
read
knowing,
as
modifying
everything
that
follows
it
in
271(c).
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well,
that
is
necessarily
part
of
what
the
court
held
in
271(c).
and
i
would
agree,
this
would
be
a
very,
very
different
case
if
271(b)
had
the
word
knowing.
i
mean
aro
in
many
ways
was
a
much
easier
case,
but
the
question
is
do
you
have
to
demonstrate
that
something
is
knowing
and
the
statute
says
it
must
be
knowing,
then
that
is--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
think
if
the
conclusion
were
to
send
it
back
and
do
it
again,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable
result.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that
is
what
they
argued
to
the
jury
and
that's--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
jury
heard
those
arguments,
the
jury
rejected
those
arguments.
the
argument
that
was
presented
to
the
jury,
although
the
precise
words
willful
blindness
weren't
used,
the
argument
that
was
presented
to
the
jury
was
willful
blindness
argument.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
what
the
jury
was
instructed
was
several
things
and
the
jury
instructions
are
at
ra
26
and
27.
the
jury
instruction
that
was
used,
by
the
way,
was
the
model
jury
instruction
that
has
been
used
since
1998,
has
been
unchanged
and
has
included
largely
this
language
since
1998
over
and
over
again.
that
is
the
jury
instruction
we
are
dealing
with.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
it
is
a
complicated
instruction,
so
part
of
what--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--that
is
part
of
the
argument
pentalpha
presents.
i
don't
believe
that
is
accurate.
number
one,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
plaintiff
had
to
prove
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
defendant
actively
and
knowingly
aided
and
abetting
the
direct
infringement.
that
is
part
of
the
instruction.
that
they
actively
and
knowingly.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
ra
26
and
27.
it
is
the
end
of
the
red
brief.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
that
is
correct.
number
one,
we
are
certainly
not
advocating
a
general
burden
on
all
producers
to
do
a
patent
search.
that
is
not
remotely
the
position
we
are
presenting.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
what
i
would
suggest
the
import
of
that
language
is,
is
to
allow
constructive
knowledge.
is
to
allow
essentially
willful
blindness,
which
was
the
entire
way
it
was
argued
to
the
jury.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
argument
that
was
presented
to
the
jury,
in
closing
what
trial
counsel
said
and
this
is
the
trial
transcript,
page
929
through
31,
which
is
not
in
one
of
the
appendixes
in
front
of
you.
i
apologize
for
that.
but
what
the
transcript
says
is
that
mr.
sham,
the
ceo,
never
told
his
patent
lawyer,
look,
what
we
are
doing
is
copying
this
seb
product.
what
he
did,
i
suggest
to
you,
is
he
set
mr.
levy
up
to
fail.
he
set
him
up
to
fail
by
not
telling
him
he
had
copied
the
product.
that
was
the
theory
that
was
argued
as
to
why
they
should
have
known,
because
this
was
in
effect
a
sham,
that
not
telling
the
lawyer
about
the
product,
it
wasn't
an
accident.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
kennedy,
we
are
not
proposing
that,
and
i
would
say
two
things.
number
one,
there
is
an
entire
instruction
on
inducement
and
there
is
also
the
language
i
read
before
that
is
part
of
the
jury
charge
on
inducement.
and
i
don't
think
the
jury
can
be
presumed
to
have
only
listened
to
one
snippet
of
the
instruction
without
the
entire
instruction.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
would
suggest
with
respect
to
the
language
knew
or
should
have
known,
that
if
there
is
not
an
actual
knowledge
requirement,
which
in
my
judgment
is
nowhere
in
the
statute,
then
you
have
to
have
something
like
should
have
known
because
i
do
not
know
what
you
alternative
instruct.
if
it
is
not
actual
knowledge
then
there
is
a
situation
where
someone
is
allowed
to
have
constructive
knowledge.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
absolutely.
i
don't
think
the
statute
makes
any
sense
unless
(b)
is
understood
to
have
a
lesser
standard.
otherwise,
the
inclusion
of
the
word
"knowing"
is
given
no
effect.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
breyer,
under
that
argument,
the
statute
would
be
interpreted
identically
if
the
word
(b).
and
given
that
they
added
it
to
(c)
and
not
to
(b)--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
breyer,
that
--
that
may
be
a
reasonable
policy
argument.
however,
that
is
also
a
reasonable
policy
argument
for
modifying
a,
because
right
now,
the
aluminum
company
is
liable
under
strict
liability
for
direct
infringement
today.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
we
have
suggested
three
possible
standards
to
be
the
rule
in
this
case.
the
first,
the
court
could
choose
to
adopt
the
standard
that
was
adopted
in
grokster,
and
we
have
argued
at
considerable
length
that
under
the
standard
this
court
adopted
in
grokster,
the
plaintiffs
--
the
defendants,
rather,
would
be
liable
and
it
would
uphold
the
judgment
below.
that
is
the
broadest
standard
the
court
could
adopt.
a
more
narrow
standard
the
court
could
adopt
is
that
at
a
minimum,
willful
blindness
of
the
patented
issue
suffices
to
allow
inducement
liability.
that
is
a
more
narrow
standard.
it
would
cover
a
much
narrower
universe
of
conduct.
it
would
exclude
much
of
the
conduct
both
justice
breyer
and
justice
kennedy
are
suggesting.
that
is
the
second
way
this
judgment
could
be
affirmed
and
a
more
narrow
rule.
the
most
narrow
rule
we
have
suggested
this
court
could
adopt
is
in
the
limited
circumstances
when
a
defendant
deliberately
copies
another
commercial
product,
at
a
minimum,
that
defendant
has
an
obligation
to
ascertain
if
that
specific
product
has
protected
u.s.
intellectual
property,
that
it
is
a
very
minor
obligation
that
is
triggered
only
when
you
take
a
commercial
product
on
the
marketplace,
reverse-engineer
it,
and
copy
it,
because
it
is
a
situation
that
is
highly
likely
to
be
indicative
of
bad
conduct,
to
be
risking
a
very
substantial
infringement
of
someone
else's
ip,
and
in
terms
of
a
low-cost
avoider,
one
of
the
things
at
footnote
20
of
our
brief--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--if
they
had
said
three
words
differently,
this
would
be
a
very,
very
different
case.
if
they
had
simply,
in
talking
to
their
lawyer,
said:
we
copied
seb.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
yes.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
if
you
specifically
copy
a
product,
you
have
to
look
to
see
if
that
particular
product
is
protected
by
ip.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well,
and
--
and
that--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well,
the
court
could
certainly
craft
the
rule
at
least
narrowly
tailored
to
the
facts
here,
which
is
copying.
and
look,
copying
is
not
a
unique
problem.
it
is
a
serious
problem
internationally,
with
u.s.
intellectual
property
being
stolen,
copied,
and
marketed.
and
if
pentalpha
were
to
prevail,
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
unless
you
had
actual
knowledge,
you
know
to
a
hundred
percent
certainty,
this
violates
patent
'312,
you're
immune
from
liability,
that
decision
of
this
court
would
serve
as
a
roadmap.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but,
justice
kennedy,
the
reason
in
this
case
why
we
brought
a
cause
of
action
for
both
direct
infringement
and
active
inducing
is
because
the
argument
of
pentalpha
was
their
conduct
was
all
overseas,
and
so
they
weren't
covered
by
271(a).
the
entire
reason
for
the
inducing
strategy
is
they
may
well
prevail
in
another
case
on
saying,
we
stole
your
property
overseas
so
you
can't
get
us
for
direct
infringement.
and
in
that
instance,
inducing
is
the
only
way
to
get
the
actual
mastermind.
i
mean,
that
was
one
of
the
phrases
giles
rich
used
in
defense
of
271.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
think
there
is
a
reasonable
statutory
argument
to
be
made
that
it
is
the
same,
namely,
that
it
is
strict
liability.
we
are
not
pressing
that
as
the
only
way
to
prevail,
but
i
think
there
is
certainly
a
reasonable
statutory
argument.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
do,
and
i
will
tell
you
why.
because--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
agree
with
you
that
is
what
petitioner
said
here.
my
understanding
of
petitioner's
position
was
the
same
as
yours,
mr.
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy,
that
they
are
effectively
requiring
actual
knowledge,
that
that's
what
their
urging
is.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
let
me
answer
both
your
question,
justice
kagan,
and
the
chief
justice's
question
together.
grokster
used
language
about
purposeful
culpable
conduct,
but
it
went
further.
it
specified
how
you
ascertain
whether
that
standard
is
met,
and
it
said
as
shown
by
other
affirmative
acts
to
encourage
inducement.
now,
in
grokster,
part
of
the
argument
grokster
made
was,
we
do
not
know
what
copyrights
are
going
to
be
violated.
we
do
not
know
what
is
going
to
be
--
they
made
the
same
argument
pentalpha
is
making:
we
have
no
idea
of
any
specific
copyright
that
will
ever
be
infringed.
they
argued,
we
do
not
have
actual
knowledge
of
the
specific
copyrights.
and
this
court
said:
that
doesn't
matter.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that
policy
differential
--
there
may
well
be
differences
between
patent
law
and
copyright
law
that
are
implicated
in
other
cases.
here,
what
occurred
is
an
entire
commercial
product
was
copied.
it
is
much
more
akin
to
copyright
infringement,
where
the
entire
product
was
copied
and
they
just
changed
the
cosmetic
features.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
let
me
be
--
let
me
be
clear,
justice
scalia.
i
am
not
advocating
this
court
do
so.
what
i
am
saying
is
if
this
court
were
to
apply
the
grokster
test,
we
believe
we
prevail
under
it,
and
in
fact
any
comparison
of
grokster
to
pentalpha,
pentalpha
is
clearly
the
more
culpable
actor.
in
grokster,
the
individuals
violating
the
copyrights
were
the
ones
who
made
the
choice
to
directly
and
deliberately
violate
the
copyrights
and
grokster
simply
provided
the
tool
to
do
so.
here
the
only
bad
actor
was
pentalpha.
sunbeam,
montgomery
ward,
they
had
no
idea
of
the
infringement.
pentalpha
was
the
mastermind
behind
the
entire
patent
violation,
and
in
fact
because
of
its
actions
procuring
a
right
to
use
opinion,
by
keeping
the
relevant
information
from
its
patent
lawyer,
it
lured,
it
induced
sunbeam
and
montgomery
ward
and
fingerhut
into
committing
the
bad
act.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
do
not
believe
there
is
in
the
precedent.
for
one
thing,
reckless
disregard
is
the
standard
now.
willfulness
and
recklessness
are
the
standard
right
now
for
enhanced
damages
and
attorney's
fees;
and
if
it
were
the
case
that
every
violation
of
271(b)
required
willfulness
or
recklessness,
it
would
also
mean
that
every
violation
would
qualify
for
enhanced
damages
or
attorney's
fees.
i
don't
think
that's
consistent
with
the
statutory
standard.
that's
not
the
language
congress
adopted.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
you
know,
i
do
not
believe
there
is.
particularly
how
"should
have
known"
was
used
in
this
case,
a,
the
jury
was
--
the
way
the
jury
was
instructed,
i
would
suggest
it
was
effectively
a
constructive
knowledge
instruction.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
if
you
look
at--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
agree
the
federal
circuit
had
that
language.
i
would
not
suggest
that
standard
was
the
wrong
standard,
but
what
i
would
say,
what
the
federal
circuit
in
fact
did
is
it
applied
willful
blindness.
if
you
look
at
the
cases
it
cited,
if
you
look
at
how
it
in
fact
interpreted
it,
although
it
used
the
deliberate
indifference
language,
which
i
will
concede
was
somewhat
confusing
in
its
reasoning.
if
you
look
at
it,
it
framed
it
as
whether
pentalpha
had
constructive
knowledge
of
the
patent,
and
it
then
cited
willful
blindness
cases
from
other
circuits
that
focused
it
on
actively
disregarding
a
known
risk
and
deliberate
avoidance
and
consciously
avoided
knowledge.
all
of
that
is
willful
blindness
knowledge.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
correct.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
agree
with
that
entirely.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
agree
with
that
entirely,
and
indeed
we
have
suggested
the
central
issue,
the
question
before
this
court
is,
is
there
a
requirement
of
actual
knowledge
of
the
specific
patent?
and
in
my
judgment
there
is
no
reasonable
argument
from
the
statutory
language
that
in
order
to
be
liable
under
271(b)
you
must
specifically
know
to
100
percent
certainty
this
is
violating
patent
number
312.
that
is
the
issue
they
objected.
that
is
the
issue
that
has
been
brought
before
this
court.
is--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--if
it
is
a
case
that
you
must
specifically
know
the
specific
patent,
it
will
ensure
that
unscrupulous--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
am
going
to
suggest
it
is
a
binary
choice.
it
is
either
actual
specific
knowledge
of
the
patent,
or
it
is
some
form
of
"should
have
known"
that
allows
constructive
knowledge.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but,
justice
breyer--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--in
this
case,
you
had
unusual--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well,
let
me
suggest
what
words
you
could
use
to
resolve
this
case.
because--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
language
that
--
that
was
used
in
santos
was
that
willful
blindness
is
that
when
a
party
aware
of
a
high
probability
of
a
fact
deliberately
avoids
learning
the
truth.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that
language
would
encompass
this
case--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--and
it
would
not
bring
in
innocent
actors.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
think
that
would
be
an
acceptable
test
this
court
could--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--a
--
with
respect
to
what
was
happening
here,
when
you
copy
a
commercial
product,
there
is
a
high
probability
that
product
is
protected
by
a
patent,
and
when
you
engage
in
what
the
district
court
characterized--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
--
what
i
would
suggest
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
we
proffered
the
narrow
test
that
is
keyed
on
copying,
because
copying
of
completed
commercial
products
is
the
most
egregious.
if
the
court
is
concerned
about
unintended
consequences,
that
narrow
rule
is
the
most
narrow
rule.
let
--
if
i
could
briefly
suggest--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--with
respect,
my
client
doesn't
care--
[laughter]
--as
long
as
the
result
is
at
the
end,
the
opinion
is
affirmed.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
agree
that
would
suffice.
with
respect
to
why
this
court
should
not
remand,
if
i
may
very
briefly
make
three
points.
number
one,
this
case
has
been
going
on
for
12
years.
to
remand
for
a
new
trial
would
drag
it
on
to
more
endless
litigation
for
no
purpose.
the
district
court
observed
below
this
case
was
not
a
close
case.
it
took
the
jury
109
minutes
to
resolve
against
pentalpha
on
every
single
ground
that
was
presented
to
it.
number
two,
the
jury
charge
that
was
sent
to
the
jury
was
more
than
sufficient
under
any
of
these
standards.
but
number
three,
the
alternative
argument
we
made,
there
was
a
finding
of
direct
infringement.
that
finding
of
direct
infringement
is
also
supported
by
the
damage
award
and
that
is
an
alternative
ground
to
remand
it.
now,
in
the
reply
brief
pentalpha
says,
focuses
on
the
same
differential
that
the
federal
circuit
did
between
the
language
of
the
jury
charge
and
the
language
of
the
verdict
form,
but
the
only
evidence
the
jury
had
of
the
number
of
units
sold
by
anybody
was
the
stipulation.
in
their
reply
brief
they
say,
well,
there
could
have
been
some
sold
in
canada.
that
was
lawyer
argument.
the
only
evidence,
which
everyone
agreed,
was
the
stipulation
and
if
that
is
true
that
supports
the
damage
award.
