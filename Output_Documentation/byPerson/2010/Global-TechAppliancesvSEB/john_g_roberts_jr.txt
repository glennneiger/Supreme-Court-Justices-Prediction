chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
10-6,
global-tech
appliances
v.
seb
s.a.--
mr.
dunnegan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
your
position
when
you're
--
when
you're
talking
about
willful
blindness
or
purpose,
whatever,
is
that
with
respect
to
a
particular
patent,
or
is
it
with
respect
to
infringement
of
a
patent?
i
don't
think
it's
true
with
deep
fryers,
but
in
some
areas,
you
almost
always
know
you're
going
to
hit
something,
that
given
the
nature
of
the
industry,
you're
going
to
infringe
something.
is
that
enough?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
--
i
mean,
i
understand
you're
in
the
deep
fryer
industry,
but
that
standard
would
bring
the
semiconductor
industry
to
a
halt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
the
--
the
problem
is,
even
if
you
do
do
your
diligence,
given
the
way
patents
are
these
days,
if
there
are
420,000,
you're
never
going
to
know
with
any
degree
of
comfort
that
you're
not
going
to
infringe
something.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
we
might
decide
that
it's
more
important
to
consider
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
semiconductor
industry
in
articulating
our
standard
than
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
deep-fryer
industry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
why
is
that
--
how
is
that
different
from
knowing?
i
--
i
--
my
impression
was
the
same
as
justice
kennedy's.
i
thought
you
wanted
the
knowing
standard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you're
talking--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
if
you're
--
i'm
sorry.
i
do
not
want
to
interfere
with
your
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'll
wait.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cruz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
was
the
jury
instructed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
am
still
waiting
to
hear
what
it
was?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
there
was
some
question
about
that
it
was
so
low
that
it
in
effect
amounted
to
a
negligence
standard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
am
a
little
confused
about
the
relationship
between
knowledge
and
the
grokster
standard.
you
think
knowledge
is
a
more
favorable
standard
for
petitioner
than
grokster.
you're
willing
to
accept
grokster,
but
not
willing
to
accept
actual
knowledge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
before
you
tell
me
why,
do
you
understand
--
it's
unfair
to
ask
you,
i
guess,
but
i
understood
petitioner
to
take
the
opposite
position:
that
grokster
was
a
more
favorable
standard
for
him
than
actual
knowledge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
high
probability
of
what?
a
high
probability
that
you
will
infringe
this
--
a
patent
or
any
patent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cruz.
mr.
dunnegan,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
