mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
turning
to
the
substance,
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may,
start
with
the
procedural
question
that
justice
sotomayor
raised
and
that
--
and
that
my
opponent
just
completed
with,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
there's
no
confusion
on
the
posture
of
this
case.
in
particular,
this
court's
precedents
squarely
reject
the
notion
that
there's
any
history
in
this
court's
precedents
for
refusing
to
reach
an
argument
in
this
posture.
in
particular,
in
langness
v.
green,
282
u.s.
531,
this
court
held
in
1931
that
a
respondent's,
quote,
"right"
to
defend
a
judgment
below
on
a
ground
that
is
properly
preserved
all
along
and
that
the
lower
court
reached
and
rejected
is,
quote,
"beyond
successful
challenge".
now,
i'm
not
sure
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any
exception
from
that
rule
in
the
80
years
since.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i'll
take
your
hypothetical,
justice
alito,
but
i
do
want
to
be
able
to
correct
the
notion
that
it's
of
no
longer
continuing
importance.
but
i'll
assume
that
your
hypothetical
on
that
kind
of
a
question
would
be
cert
denied.
but
that's
never
been
an
obstacle
to
reaching
the
question.
let
me
give
you
two
things
that
are
very
important
here.
the
first
is
the
problem
with
the
government's
citation
to
nobles
is
not
just
a
distinction
between
discretion
and
law.
if
you
look
at
the
solicitor
general's
own
reply
brief
in
that
case,
it
pointed
out
that
the
problem
with
the
alternative
argument
there
was
that
it
would
give
the
defendant
different
relief.
so
it
was
therefore
subject
to
the
cross-petitions
rule,
and
that's
the
section
in
stern
and
gressman
that's
cited
in
their
briefs.
those
are
the
only
two
citations
they
have,
the
citations
to
nobles
and
the
citations
to
stern
and
gressman,
which
are
all
about
cross-petitions
when
the
defendant
wants
different
relief.
we
want
exactly
the
same
relief.
we
want
a
dismissal
on
the
speedy
trial
act.
so
finally,
even
if
it
were
somehow
discretionary
and
this
court
were
to
consider
in
this
case
breaking
from
its
unbroken
precedent
of
80
years
--
let
me
give
you
one
more
example
before
i
turn
to
the
discretionary.
in
the
walling
case
in
1947,
this
court
reached
as
an
alternative
ground
the
defendant's
argument
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence.
now,
that's
sort
of
the
quintessential
un-cert-worthy
question,
but
this
court
felt
required
to
reach
it
because
the
lower
court
had
reached
it
and
rejected
it
and
the
defendant
had
preserved
it
all
along
in
that
case.
and
in
the
union
pacific
case
in
2009
--
i
can
keep
giving
you
citations.
but
let
me
just
say,
even
if
it
were
discretionary,
you
would
still
want
to
reach
it
in
this
case,
because
at
pages
18
and
19
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief
there
are
citations
to
a
circuit
split
on
this
issue.
and
the
new
rule
45
hasn't
made
that
go
away
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
because
the
solicitor
general's
own
argument
now
doesn't
depend
on
rule
45.
instead,
it's
that
the
speedy
trial
act
on
its
own
terms
counts
10
business
days,
not
simply
calendar
days.
and,
second,
there
continue
to
be
decisions
after
the
amendment
of
rule
45
in
which
lower
courts
have
said
that
this
provision
means
only
10
business
days.
let
me
give
you
one
more
citation,
and
forgive
me
for
this
because
we
didn't
get
to
file
a
reply
brief
in
this
case
on
this
issue.
but
the
zabawa
case,
2010
westlaw,
307-5044,
is
a
case
in
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
last
summer
where
the
government's
own
filing,
which
we
looked
at
on
pacer,
asked
the
court
to
apply
tinklenberg
and
hold
that
subsection
(f)
meant
only
ten
business
days.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
you're
not
duty-bound
to
decide
it,
justice
alito.
but
i
do
think
under
this
court's
precedent,
at
least,
you
have
never
reversed
the
decision
below
without
reaching
them.
so
you
may
well
affirm
on
the
question
presented
or
some
one
or
two
of
those
questions.
you
may
also
dismiss
the
case
as
improvidently
granted,
which
happens
sometimes
in
these
circumstances.
of
course,
what
ordinarily
what
would
happen
is
when
the
cert
--
when
the
ops
was
filed
this
court
would
realize
there
was
a
serious
obstacle
to
reaching
the
question
and
might
well
deny
cert
in
the
first
place.
but
as
i
said,
there's
no
decision
on
this
court's
books
and
certainly
the
solicitor
general
hasn't
appointed
one
where
you've
reversed
and
reinstated
a
conviction
or,
in
fact,
reversed
and
done
anything
to
a
respondent
in
these
circumstances.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
ten
day
argument
and
make
a
few
points
before
i'm
sure
the
court
might
want
to
talk
about
the
pretrial
motions
issue
as
well.
there's
a
few
important
points
to
make.
now,
remember,
the
solicitor
general
has
now
basically
abandoned
the
sixth
circuit's
view
that
rule
45
automatically
gets
incorporated
into
the
speedy
trial
act
and
now
they're
making
the
making
the
argument
that
what
congress
intended
in
the
speedy
trial
act
was
somehow
for
rule
45
to
operate
as
some
background
principle.
so
that
the
meaning
of
the
act,
i
guess,
would
wax
and
wane
according
to
what
rule
45
said.
now,
there's
two
versions
of
this
argument.
i
can't
tell
which
it's
making.
first
it
could
be
saying
that
what
congress
meant
when
it
passed
subsection
f
in
1979
was
that
whatever
the
rule
is
in
rule
45
right
now,
that's
what
we
expect
to
be
applied.
well,
that
can't
possibly
be
the
solicitor
general's
argument
because
in
1979
rule
45,
consistent
with
the
traditional
rule,
excluded
weekends
and
holidays
only
for
periods
of
less
than
seven
days.
that
wasn't
changed
until
1985.
so
the
congress
at
the
time,
even
if
they
had
cared
about
rule
45,
wouldn't
have,
wouldn't
have
thought
you
counted,
excluded
weekends
and
holidays
here.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
the
much
more
natural
reading,
justice
ginsburg,
in
light
of
the
traditional
rule,
which
is
not
just
cited
in
am.
jur.
,
please
understand,
this
is
a
cannon
of
common
law,
traditional
construction
of
time
periods
that
goes
back
to
sutherland's
treatise
in
1904.
there's
a
second
circuit
case
called
morasca
in
1921,
277
f.
2727,
i
could
cite
you
20
or
30
state
cases
all
up
and
down
the
last
century.
so
the
common
law
rule
has
always
been
for
periods
of
less
than
seven
days
--
i'm
sorry,
for
periods
of
more
than
seven
days,
it's
up
to
the
legislature
to
expressly
tell
the
court
to
exclude
weekends
and
holidays.
and
if
you
look
at
the
u.s.
code,
it's
perfectly
consistent
with
that
common
law
understanding
because
when
congress
wanted,
such
as
in
the
bail
reform
act,
to
exclude
weekends
and
holidays
from
a
ten
day
period,
it
expressly
says
so.
now,
we
cited
three
or
four
examples
in
our
brief.
again,
this
is
at
page
40,
41
of
our
brief.
i
could
have
cited
15
or
20.
so
the
u.s.
code
is
quite
clear
and
i
think
the
much
more
natural
inference
its
that
when
congress
wanted
to
exclude
weekends
and
holidays
consistent
with
the
traditional
rule,
it
felt
duty
bound
to
say
so
in
the
u.s.
code,
and
when
it
hasn't,
it
wants
simply
calendar
days
--
now,
if
you
want
confirmation.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
does
now,
but
two
things
are
telling
about
the
2009
amendments.
the
first
is
that
when
it
switched
to
statutes,
it
reverted
to
counting
calendar
days.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right,
that's
right.
but
if
you
want
to
talk
about
congressional
intent,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
even
go
there.
but,
remember,
after
the
--
in
2009
there's
also
a
federal
law,
the
technical
amendments
statutory
act
made
a
hash
of
that.
but
congress
went
through,
most
recently
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
and
amended
various
provisions
of
the
u.s.
code
according
to
whether
it
wanted
weekends
or
holidays
excluded
or
times
enlarged,
and
it
left
this
alone.
so
i
think
every
indicia
of
evidence
you
can
look
at
from
every
possible
angle
shows
that
ten
days
meant
ten
days
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
and
that's
enough
to
affirm
the
judgment.
the
last
point
i'll
make
concerning--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
my
point,
justice
alito,
is
congress
didn't
think
of
the
speedy
trial
act,
it
didn't
do
anything
with
the
speedy
trial
act.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
maybe
we
leave
that
where
it
was,
but
let
me
make
one
final
point
that
i
think
is
the
clincher
here.
remember,
we
have
not
just
this
alternative
argument,
we
have
a
second
alternative
argument,
which
is
that
the
time
in
relation
to
mr.
tinklenberg's
competency
hearing
exceeded
the
30
day
provision
in
section
4247
in
the
insanity
defense
reform
act.
now,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
get
to
that
argument,
you
can
simply
affirm
on
the
ten
day
issue,
but,
again,
let's
think
about
what
the
solicitor
general
is
arguing
with
respect
to
the
ten
day
issue.
they're
saying
that
congress
sub
silentio,
without
saying
anything
at
all
in
the
speedy
trial
act,
somehow
assumed
that
the
time
in
subsection
f
would
wax
and
wane
according
to
this
rule.
well,
if
that's
--
even
though
the
rule
didn't
even
apply
to
statutes
at
the
time.
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
i
don't
think
there's
any
basis
for
arguing
that
congress
would
have
had
exactly
the
same
assumption
with
respect
to
another
federal
statute,
that
is
the
insanity
defense
reform
act.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
so
i
think
the
only
way
--
somehow,
you've
accepted
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
which
i
don't
think
you
can,
but
if
you
did
accept
it
on
merits,
it
runs
headlong
into
our
third
argument,
which
the
solicitor
general
takes
exactly
the
opposite
position,
which
is,
the
speedy
trial
act
is
its
own
self-contained
universe
that
doesn't
incorporate
any
other
statutes
or
any
other
provisions
of
law.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
you
could
do
that,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
you
could
decide
based
on
my
discussion
of
the
zabawa
case.
there's
another
case
that
postdates
the
rule
45
amendments,
called
clifton,
out
of
the
southern
district
of
mississippi.
so
you
might
decide
that
there's
enough
of
an
ongoing
question
here
to
write
an
opinion.
you
could
do
either
one.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
and
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
as
to
your
--
your
question,
i'll
just
leave
it
to
this
court's
best
discretion
how
it
wants
to
handle
that
issue.
now,
justice
kennedy,
let
me
turn
to
the
merits.
we
think
this
is
a
straightforward
case
where
the
text
dictates
the
outcome
of
the
case.
remember,
the
key
words
in
the
statute
are
"delay
resulting
from",
and
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
ordinary
meaning,
in
fact,
the
only
meaning,
of
"delay"
is
a
hindrance
to
progress
or
a
postponement.
so
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
exactly
our
argument,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
argument
is
there's
two
ways
you
can
have
delay:
one
is
by
the
trial
date
simply
being
moved
to
accommodate
the
motion.
the
other
--
and
this
is
where
we
agree
with
what
the
solicitor
general
said
here
today,
as
well
as
at
page
38-39
of
his
opening
brief
--
delay
can
also,
in
the
ordinary
english
language,
mean
that
the
trial
date
was
originally
set
to
accommodate
the
motions
in
the
way
you
just
described.
but
what
the
solicitor
general
is
arguing
for
is
something
much
more
dramatic
than
that.
they
are
arguing
for
an
exclusion
of
the
time,
even
if
trial
date
was
set
irregardless
of
the
motions--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
ordinarily,
justice
ginsburg
--
remember,
this
is
only
a
small
subset
of
cases.
but
in
those
cases,
ordinarily,
i
would
think
the
trial
judge
would
say
on
the
record
when
the
date
is
set.
now,
if
it's
--
if
there's
motion
practice
before
there's
any
date
that's
ever
set,
the
nacdl
brief,
i
think,
explains
how
that
works
in
the
district
in
the
sixth
circuit
right
now.
parties
often
stipulate
or
are
asked
to
stipulate
by
the
court.
common
sense
goes
a
long
way
in
this
scenario,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
obvious.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
defendants
don't
always
benefit
from
the
clock
running,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
there's
two
reasons
why
they
might
stipulate.
one
is
because
it
might
simply
be
obvious
that
the
motion
is
of
sufficient
weight
and
difficulty
that
it's
going
to
consume
the
court's
resources,
so
why
argue
something
that
wouldn't
have
a
basis
to
begin
with?
but
i
think
the
nacdl
brief
is
forthright
in
saying,
at
least
at
the
beginning
of
criminal
cases,
often
defendants
find
themselves
wanting
more
time,
and
so,
again,
they
don't
have
the
incentive
to
argue
against
that.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
the
--
the
text
of
the
statute
allows
you
to
say
either
30
or
10.
i
think
in
light
of
this
court's
henderson
decision
--
and
perhaps
i
think
congress
had
administrability
concerns
in
mind
with
that
last
clause
--
i
think
30
days
could
be
excluded.
but
if
you
disagree
with
me
on
that
and
you
want
to
have
a
rigid
textual
reading
of
the
statute
resulting
from
only
meaning
10
days,
i
think
that's
your
only
other
option.
because,
if
i
could
ask
the
court,
or
at
least
direct
the
court
to
page
6
of
the
solicitor
general's
reply
brief,
this
is
where
they
give
--
because
i
think
what
the
government
wants
to
do
is
pose
these
difficult
hypotheticals,
and
the
sort
of
difficult
question
you
just
raised,
justice
alito,
and
have
this
court
respond
by
saying,
oh,
we're
just
going
to
throw
the
words
"delay
resulting
from"
out
of
the
statute.
because
there's
only
two
definitions,
two
ways
to
deal
with
what
the
solicitor
general
offers.
first,
they
say
that
delay
means
time,
and
i
think
ordinary
--
in
ordinary
english
language,
"delay"
means
something
more
than
time.
it
means
postponement.
so
then
the
fallback
argument
--
this
is
the
second
paragraph
on
page
6
--
is
that
the
occurrence
that
is
postponed
is
the
sta's
deadline
for
commencing
trial,
and
our
suggestion
is
that
that
begs
the
whole
question.
that
can't
possibly
be
right,
because
the
whole
reason
that
you're
looking
to
subsection
(d)
to
apply
it
is
to
ask
whether
you
should
exclude
the
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
for
two
reasons,
i
would
disagree,
respectfully,
justice
sotomayor.
first
is,
i
take
that
language
to
say
that
we're
going
to
now
tell
you
all
the
circumstances
under
which
you
exclude
time,
and
so
if
any
of
these
subsections
are
satisfied,
you
exclude
the
time.
but
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--solicitor
general's
argument
is
that
you
start
from
the
premise.
"delay
resulting
from"
means
you've
already
excluded
the
time.
that's
the
premise.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
if
--
if
there
was
delay.
maybe
another
example,
justice
sotomayor.
in
subsection
7,
which
is
at
(4)(a)
of
the
government's
appendix,
i
think
is
another
way
of
showing
that
it
can't
possibly
--
even
if
it
weren't
begging
the
question,
it
can't
possibly
be
right.
it
has
to
be
talking
about
the
trial
itself,
because
this
is
the
continuance
--
the
end
of
the
justice
continuance
section.
and
it
says,
"any
period
of
delay
resulting
from
a
continuance
granted
by
a
judge
on
his
own
motion.
"
and
blah,
blah,
blah,
"if
certain
criteria
are
met".
now,
it's
very
clear
that
in
that
section,
"period"
--
"period
of
delay
resulting
from"
can't
mean
that
we've
already
said
that
the
clock
is
stopped,
because
there's
an
"if"
clause
that
gives
you
certain
things
that
have
to
be
satisfied
in
order
to
exclude
it.
so
i
think
starting
with
the
very
title
of
the
act
we're
talking
about,
the
speedy
trial
act,
and
the
--
the
idea
of
the
words
"delay
resulting
from"
can
only
sensibly
mean
delay
resulting
from
trial.
and
so
i
think
the
definition
that
we've
given
you
again,
which
is,
delay
results
from
a
trial
if
the
trial
itself
is
postponed,
or
if
the
trial
is
set
in
a
way
that
accommodates
the
motion,
is
the
only
way
to
give
meaning
to
the
operative
words
in
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
the
distinction
between
administrative
and
nonadministrative
motions,
i
think,
doesn't
matter
in
this
case
because
trial
wasn't--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
it
would
matter,
i
think,
justice
sotomayor,
in
a
circumstance
where
the
trial
date
hadn't
been
set
yet
and
then
was
set,
and
an
argument
might
arise
--
well,
i
think
we've
had
this
dialogue
already
to
some
degree.
i
didn't
--
i
expected
these
kinds
of
motions
to
be
filed.
i
knew
there
was
going
to
be
a
suppression
hearing.
we
had
the
whole
--
therefore,
i
set
the
trial
out.
that
would
seem
to
be
saying
this
was
a
nonadministrative
matter
that
i
had
to
accommodate.
i
don't
think
a
trial
judge
--
put
another
way,
i
don't
think
a
trial
judge
could
say
i'm
setting
trial
date
outside
the
70-day
deadline
because
i
had
to
sign
my
name
to
that
pro
haec
vice
motion.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that
may
well
be
correct,
but
i
don't
know
why
it
would
matter,
because
it
doesn't
matter
until
you
get
outside
of
the
70
days
to
begin
with.
so--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--let
me
say
a
couple
things,
justice
breyer.
first,
with
all
due
respect,
i
have
to
disagree
with
your
premise
that
it's
possible
to
read
the
statute
the
way
the
solicitor
general
wants
to
read
it.
now
i'll
accept
for
purposes
of
responding
to
your
question,
let's
imagine
that
it
were
possible
to
read
it
that
way.
i
think
our
rule
is
not
as
difficult
to
administer
as
you
think
it
might
be
in
the
--
nacdl
brief
ldy.
and
indeed
the
solicitor
general
--
this
has
been
the
--
this
has
been
the
law
in
--
in
the
sixth
circuit
for
17
months.
they
haven't
pointed
to
a
single
dismissal
as
a
result
of
it.
now
let
me
take
the
other
side,
and
this
brings
us
to
the
dialogue
during
mr.
roberts'
argument;
the
solicitor
general's
rule
isn't
so
easy,
either,
unless
you
simply
cease
caring
at
all
about
the
act.
you
could
have
a
perfectly
administrable
rule
that
says
every
singly
motion,
no
matter
what
the
circumstances,
tolls
the
clock.
but
that's
not
the
law
in
the
first
circuit,
for
example.
they're
made
clear
as
justice
sotomayor
said
that
if
a
motion
is
filed
to
frustrate
the
speedy
trial
clock,
then
we're
not
going
to
exclude
it;
and
that
makes
perfect
sense.
i
mean,
look
at
this
case.
and
i'm
not
going
to
suggest
there
was
any
ill
will
or
bad
faith
in
this
case;
but
the
facts
of
the
case
illustrate
the
problem.
on
august
1st,
trial
date
was
set
for
august
14th.
there
were
14
days
before
the
trial
was
going
to
happen.
yet
there
were
only
--
even
under
the
best
reading
there
were
only
10
days
left
on
the
clock.
so
if
no
motions
had
been
filed,
unquestionably
we
would
have
a
speedy
trial
act
violation.
so
the
government's
whole
case
hinges
on
the
fact
that
because
it
filed
this
purely
administrative
motion
to
bring
a
gun
into
the
courtroom,
a
motion
i
might
add
that
at
the
pretrial
conference
the
judge
had
already
told
the
government
was
going
to
be
granted,
and
so
i
don't
know
why
it
couldn't
have
been
made
at
the
moment
the
evidence
was
introduced;
and
one
other
administration
motion,
then
the
speedy
trial
act
isn't
violated.
and
to
borrow
the
solicitor
general's
own
phrase
from
page
38
of
his
brief,
that
outcome
bears
no
relation
to
the
act's
purpose.
so
what
you
have
to
do
to
have,
i
think,
the
government's
argument
be
at
all
faithful,
even
if
it
were
possible
under
the
language
--
have
it
be
at
all
faithful
with
the
purpose
of
the
act,
is
to
have
some
kind
of
exception
for
motions
that
frustrate,
motions
that
are
pretextual,
motions
that
are
purely
administrative,
however
it
would
be
defined.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
and
you
walk
in--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
--
well,
two
things,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all,
we're
not
relying
in
this
court
on
the
speedy
trial
act
motion
to
get
us
to
the
speedy
trial
act
violation.
the
two
motions
the
government
filed
get
you
to
the
70
days,
and
so
we
haven't
made
an
argument
with
respect
to
the
speedy
trial
act.
but
if
we
had
to,
the
argument
would
be
--
with
regard
to
that
motion,
would
be
that
it
didn't
delay
trial.
trial
had
already
been
set,
the
court
said
this
is
when
we're
going
to
trial;
trial
wasn't
moved,
and
we
all
went
to
trial.
and
so--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
[laughter]
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that
might
be
an
argument
for
writing
the
speedy
trial
act
a
different
way,
justice
sotomayor;
but
if
the
question
is
whether
the
motion
delayed
trial
--
and
that's
the
question
that
the
speedy
trial
act
requires
the
judge
to
ask
and
answer
--
then
the
administrative
piece
of
paper
going
across
the
judge's
desk
when
the
judge
knows
ahead
of
time
it
isn't
going
to
cause
any
difficult,
simply
doesn't
delay
trial.
at
page,
i
believe
it's
5
or
6
of
the
nacdl
brief,
they
talk
about
pretrial
conferences.
and
they
say
what
happens
in
the
sixth
circuit
right
now
is
the
judge
holds
the
conference;
as
you
say,
counsel
wakes
up;
and
everybody
--
and
the
judge
says
tell
me
the
motions
you're
going
to
file.
and
the
counsel
from
both
sides
tell
the
judge
what
motions
are
going
to
be
filed,
and
they
discuss
right
then
and
there
whether
they're
going
to
delay
--
whether
they're
going
to
cause
some
delay
for
trial.
and
so--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that's
right,
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
the
difficulty
is
with
the
word
"from",
justice
scalia.
i
think
it's
a
tough
word
to
know
exactly
what
transition
is
taking
place
there,
but
in
this
court's
bloate
decision,
last
term,
i
think
--
what
i'm
--
the
argument
i'm
making
is
perfectly
consistent
with
that
decision,
where
it
said
the
"from
clause"
is
sort
of
the
boundaries
on
when
subsection
d
applies.
if
you're
talking
about
delay
that
a
motion
caused
either
after
the
hearing
or
before
the
filing,
we
don't
want
to
hear
from
you.
but
the
from
clause
tells
you
if
the
delay
falls
within
those
two
goalposts,
then
it's
excludable.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
don't
think
it's
a
perfect
way
to
say
it,
either,
justice
scalia.
and
i
said
--
in
my
dialogue
with
justice
alito,
i
think
that
you
could
also
say,
especially
with
a
little
bit
of
pushing
on
henderson,
that
"resulting
from"
actually
gives
you
a
specific
time
period
in
between
those
that
you
have
to
exclude.
but
i
think
that
that's
the
best
reading
of
the
act,
and
again,
it's
the
only
one
that
gives
--
that
gives
meaning
to
the
phrase
delay
resulting
from.
if
i
might
just
say
one
or
two
words
to
circle
back
to
where
i
began,
mr.
tinklenberg
urges
you
to
affirm
the
sixth
circuit
decision
or
to
dismiss
this
case
as
improvidently
granted;
but
what
he
urges
you
not
to
do
and
thinks
there's
no
basis
in
precedent
for
doing,
which
is
to
reverse
the
lower
court
without
reading
the
alternative
arguments;
and
with
all
due
respect,
the
10-day
argument
that
we
preserved
in
our
bio
and
we
fully
made
in
our
bottom
side
brief
in
this
case,
i
think
is
extraordinarily
strong,
and
it's
difficult
to
get
around
in
this
case
for
all
the
reasons
i've
explained.
so
with
that,
i'll
--
i'll
answer
any
other
questions
this
court
has
about
that
argument,
because
i
think
it's
very
important.
otherwise,
i'm
happy
to
submit
the
case.
