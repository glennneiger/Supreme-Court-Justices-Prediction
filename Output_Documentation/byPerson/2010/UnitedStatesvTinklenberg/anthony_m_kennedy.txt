justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
chief
justice
says
only
if
it
--
it's
really
a
circular
argument
--
only
if
it
results
in
a
delay.
well,
suppose
it
doesn't
result
in
a
delay?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
doesn't
--
that
prove
the
point
that
i
think
is
the
concern
of
the
chief
justice's
question,
that
in
some
cases
the
delay
--
there's
a
delay
that
results
and
in
other
cases
there
isn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
at
the
outset
that
things
have
been
working
fine.
of
course,
the
whole
point
of
the
act
was
to
hold
district
judges
to
a
pretty
strict
standard,
and
the
concern
is
that
there
might
be
a
very
complex
case
the
judge
just
really
wants
to
put
off
as
long
as
possible
and
will
continue
to
accept
motion
after
motion.
is
there
anything
i
can
--
i
can
read
or
consult
to
show
that
this
has
been
working
very
well
and
that
there's
not
a
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
can't
stand
the
suspense.
i
--
i
would
like
to
hear
about
the
delay
point.
