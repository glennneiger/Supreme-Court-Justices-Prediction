we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-1498,
united
states
v.
tinklenberg.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
all
that
might
be
true.
on
the
other
hand,
the
statute
does
say
"delay
resulting".
and
under
your
approach,
the
time
would
be
excluded
even
if
delay
does
not
result.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
two?
how
many
circuits
are
we
talking
about?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
courts
of
appeal--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
--
it
may
be
pertinent
on
this
question:
mr.
tinklenberg
was
designated
for
transfer
to
mcc
in
chicago
on
november
10th.
how
was
that
done?
was
that
done
by
--
is
that
a
court
order
or
is
that
an
administrative--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
the
bop
did
it,
not
a
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
seem
to
be
getting
into
this.
i
just
wanted
to
know
if
it
was
a
court
order
on
the
10th,
and
what
you're
telling
me
is
the
last
court
order
before
he
was
moved
was
on
the
2nd.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--do
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
wants
the
benefit
of
this
new
rule?
who
wants
the
new
rule?
does
the
government
want
the
new
rule
or
does
the
defendant
want
the
new
rule?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
your
rule
45
argument,
you
say
we
would
have
to
reach
this
third
argument,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you
so
early,
but
what
about
justice
ginsburg's
point,
which
i
understood
to
be
there's
always
delay
resulting
from
these
pretrial
motions;
it's
just
that
the
district
judge
takes
that
into
account,
says,
well,
i'm
going
to
have
a
lot
of
the
usual
pretrial
motions,
so
i'm
going
to
set
the
trial
date
at
this
point.
so
that
is
delay,
when
the
trial
date
might
otherwise
have
been
set,
resulting
from
these
pretrial
motions,
and
then
the
--
the
statute
goes
on
to
tell
you
how
you
count
that
delay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
