justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
is
there
--
is
there
any,
anything
to
indicate
that
what
congress
might
have
had
in
mind
is
that
in
criminal
cases
inevitably
there
are
going
to
be
motions,
and
so
the
trial
judge
is
likely
to
set
the
trial
date
for
after
that
period
runs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
because,
mr.
roberts,
as
you
pointed
out,
it's
not
a
continuing
problem
since
the
amendment
to
rule
45,
it's
calendar
days,
and
so
there's
no
problem,
and
so
what
you're
suggesting
is
we
would
not
have
granted
cert
on
that
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
think
you
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
go
back
to
--
i
don't
think
you
should
have
been
so
happy
with
the
way
the
argument
was
going--
[laughter]
--because
--
because
your
view
is,
rule
40
--
if
it's
always
assumed
that
there
be
conformity
between
rule
45
--
rule
45,
it
was
business
days,
and
then
rule
45
changed
not
only
to
say
calendar
days,
but
included
statutes
for
the
first
time.
so
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
tracks
with
rule
45,
rule
45
formerly
was
calendar
--
was
business
days,
it
is
now
calendar
days,
there
is
conformity.
and
plus,
45,
and
that
was
at
least
laid
on
the
table
of
congress,
so
they
know
that
it
was
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wouldn't
congress
think,
we
have
a
bunch
of
statutes
that
have
times
and
we
have
a
bunch
that
don't
and
the
ones
that
don't,
they
should
be
interpreted
into
the
federal
rule,
that
rule
45?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
the
2009
amendment,
rule
45
includes
statutes
it
didn't
before
and
now
it
does?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you
would
be
very
happy
if
we
didn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you
would
have
to
--
we
would
have
to
wait
for
another
case
to
decide
this
issue,
one
which
is
a
split,
that
is,
the
delay
resulting
from.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
you
ever
know
that?
how
would
we
ever
know
that,
mr.
fisher?
a
trial
judge
that
has
had
a
lot
of
criminal
cases
knows
that
there's
going
to
be
some
motions
as
you
get
closer
to
trial,
but
how
would
we
know
whether
the
judge
--
this
particular
judge
took
into
account
the
likelihood
of
motions
in
setting
the
trial
date
or
didn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
--
why
would
the
defendant
stipulate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
--
why
would
a
defendant
who
would
benefit
from
the
clock
running
stipulate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
do
you
think
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
motion
--
i
mean,
the
government
had
administrative
motions,
but
you
had
a
speedy
trial
act
motion;
and
you
say
that
doesn't
count,
either?
