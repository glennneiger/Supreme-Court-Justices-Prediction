justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
were
to
decide
this
based
on
subsection
(f)
involving
the
counting
of
10
days,
wouldn't
that
render
our
decision
on
anything
that
we
had
to
say
about
subsection
(d)
dictum?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
you're
trying
--
when
you're
trying
to
figure
out
--
when
you're
dealing
with
procedural
rules
that
involve
filing
things
in
court,
it
was
once
thought
to
make
sense
to
exclude
weekends
because
things
couldn't
be
filed
on
the
weekends,
but
when
you're
talking
about
transporting
a
prisoner.
what
sense
does
it
make
to
exclude
the
weekend?
does
this--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--do
these
flights
of
prisoners
from
one
facility
to
another
come
to
a
stop
when
--
you
know,
when
the
whistle
blows
on
saturday
--
on
friday
afternoon?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
petition
here
had
simply
raised
one
question,
and
that
is
the
question
of
how
you
count
time
under
--
under
a
version
of
rule
45
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
is
not
--
no
longer
in
effect
and
as
to
which
there
is
no
conflict
in
the
circuits.
how
would
you
grade
the
chances
of
the
court
taking
cert
on
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
i
could
just
come
back
to
where
you
started
before
you
go
on
to
these
additional
points.
your
argument
is
that
if
the
government
petitions
for
cert
on
one
issue
that's
a
legal
issue
on
which
there's
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
and
the
respondent
in
a
criminal
case
says
that
the
--
asks
to
have
the
decision
below
affirmed
on
15
other
grounds,
we
--
and
raises
those
in
the
bio,
we
take
the
case
anyway,
we
are
duty-bound
to
decide
every
one
of
those
15
grounds?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
congress
thought
about
the
speedy
trial
act
when
it
made
those
technical
amendments,
isn't
it
likely
to
have
thought
the
courts
had
interpreted
it
as
excluding
the
weekends
up
to
that
point?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
didn't
think
about
--
okay.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
aren't
they
trying
--
why
isn't
the
effect
of
what
you're
doing
to
prompt
us
to
dismiss
this
case
that
the
petitioner
has
improvidently
granted?
if
we
were
to
write
an
opinion
that
says
that
the
--
the
sixth
circuit
was
wrong
in
its
interpretation
of
subsection
(f),
and
therefore,
we're
not
going
to
get
to
--
and
anything
we
then
had
to
say
about
subsection
(d)
is
just
dictum,
and
that's
the
issue
that
we
took
the
case
to
decide,
why
should
we
keep
the
case
at
all?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
you
reconcile
your
argument
with
the
situation
in
which
the
motion
is
pending
for
30
days,
so
that's
the
period
from
the
filing
until
the
prompt
disposition,
and
as
a
result
of
that
motion,
the
trial
judge
says
this
has
caused
--
this
is
going
to
force
me,
this
is
going
to
result
in
10
days'
delay
in
the
date
on
which
the
case
can
begin,
so
the
trial
date
is
pushed
back
10
days?
now,
in
that
situation,
how
much
time
is
excluded?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
given
the
choice
between
a
dismissal
and
an
affirmance
with
good
dictum
about
subsection
(d),
you
would
prefer
the
latter?
