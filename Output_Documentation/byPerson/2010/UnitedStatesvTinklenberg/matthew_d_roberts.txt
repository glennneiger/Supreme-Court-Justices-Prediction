mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
accommodate
important
pretrial
proceedings,
the
speedy
trial
act
contains
several
automatic
exclusions
from
its
deadline
for
commencing
trial.
this
case
concerns
the
exclusion
for
pretrial
motions,
which
excludes
the
period
of
delay
resulting
from
any
pretrial
motion
from
the
filing
of
the
motion
through
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
on
or
other
prompt
disposition
of
such
motion.
for
more
than
30
years,
the
courts
of
appeals
had
uniformly
held
that
the
exclusion
applies
automatically
upon
the
filing
of
any
motion,
regardless
of
its
effect
on
the
trial
schedule.
the
court
below
correctly
rejected
that
established
rule,
which
accords
with
this
court's
decisions,
is
clear
and
easy
to
administer,
and
has
worked
well
for
over
3
decades.
the
court's
cases
construing
the
exclusion,
henderson
and
bloate,
support
the
established
rule.
they
make
clear
that
the
exclusion
applies
automatically
once
a
motion
is
filed
without
any
need
for
district
court
findings.
henderson
and
bloate
cannot
be
squared
with
the
approach
of
respondent
and
the
court
below.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor.
delay
refers
to
the
interval
of
time
from
the
filing
of
the
motion
through
its
disposition,
during
which
the
speedy
trial
act's
deadline
is
tolled.
we
know
that
delay
has
the
meaning
--
delay
can
often
have
the
meaning
of
the
interval
of
time
between
two
events.
and
we
know
it
has
that
meaning
in
the
statute
here
because
subsection
(d)
tells
us
so.
it
defines
the
period
of
excludable
delay
resulting
from
the
motion
as
the
time
from
the
filing
through
the
disposition
of
the
motion.
respondent's
definition--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that's
assuming
that
delay
is
referring
to
delay
of
the
trial,
to
a
postponement
in
the
trial.
but
delay
can't
have
that
meaning
because
if
it
has
that
--
if
that
meaning
is
inconsistent
with
subsection
(d)
of
the
statute's
exclusion
of
the
time,
of
saying
that
delay
is
the
time
from
the
filing
of
the
motion
through
the
disposition
of
the
motion,
because
the
statute
excludes
periods
of
delay.
and
if
delay
meant
postponement
of
the
trial,
then
the
excluded
period
would
be
the
time
during
which
trial
is
postponed,
but
that
period
is
often
significantly
shorter
or
longer
than
the
time
from
the
filing
of
the
motion
to
the
disposition.
and
in
henderson
and
bloate--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--but,
your
honor,
the
statute
excludes
the
period
of
delay,
and
then
it
says
the
period
of
delay
is
the
time
from
the
filing
through
the
disposition.
if
delay
--
if
delay
means
postponement
of
the
trial,
then
all
that's
excluded
by
the
statute
in
the
first
part
is
the
--
is
the
time
during
which
trial
is
postponed,
but
that
doesn't
match
up
with
subsection
(d)
because
that
period
is
not
necessarily
the
period
from
the
filing
through
the
disposition.
if
i
could
give
you
an
example.
say
a
motion
is
filed
14
days
before
trial
could
begin,
and
the
motion
takes
16
days
to
resolve.
trial
is
postponed
only
by
two
days.
and
so
if
delay
means
the
postponement
of
trial,
then
the
period
of
delay
should
be
2
days,
but
the
statute
says
that
the
delay
and
the
excludable
time
is
the
time
from
the
filing
through
the
disposition,
which
is
16
days.
and
that's
what
this
court
held
in
henderson
and
bloate,
that
that's
the
exact
time.
so
if
you
adopt
a
definition
of
delay
for
the
first
part
as
a
triggering
mechanism
that's
the
postponement
of
trial,
that
doesn't
line
up
with
the
rest
of
the
statute.
in
addition,
that
would
be
a
totally
unworkable
rule
because
whether
time
is
excludable
would
turn
on
a
complex
and
often
uncertain
analysis
of
whether
the
motion
would
or
could
delay
when
trial
would
begin,
and
it's
often
going
to
be
difficult
or
impossible
to
make
that
determination
at
the
time
that
the
motion
is
filed.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
sometimes
trial
--
judges
might
take
motions
into
account
in
setting
the
trial
date
and
other
times
they
might
not
take
the
motions
into
account.
so
a
rule
that
--
that
said
the
exclusion
only
applies
if
the
judge
moves
the
trial
date
in
response
to
the
motion
would
lead
to
arbitrary
results.
it
would
mean
basically
that
whether
time
was
excludable
depended
on
whether
the
judge
took
the
motions
into
account
when
it
set
the
trial
date
initially
or
whether
the,
whether
the
judge
correctly
estimated
the
amount
of
time.
and
also
sometimes
motions
may
be
filed
when
no
trial
date
is
set,
so
the
rule
would
be
totally
unworkable
in
that
situation.
and
respondent,
in
one
of
his
formulations
for
what
the
test
might
be,
suggests
that
a
motion
wouldn't
create
excludable
delay
unless
it
would
postpone
the
hypothetical
earliest
date
on
which
trial
could
otherwise
begin.
that's
just
a
totally
unworkable
rule,
because
to
divine
that
hypothetical
date,
courts
would
have
to
assess
the
effect
of
multiple
different
factors
that
could
affect
when
trial
would
begin,
such
as:
how
much
time
do
the
parties
and
the
counsel
need
for
factual
investigation
and
legal
analysis?
how
long
is
discovery
going
to
take?
there
would
be
numerous
questions
that
would
arise
about
how
to
apply
those
factors.
for
example,
the
courts
would
have
to
decide:
should
they
take
potential
obstacles
to
an
earlier
trial
as
given,
or
should
they
instead
think
about
whether
those
obstacles
could
be
eliminated?
the
courts
would
also
have
to
figure
out
what
to
do
if
the
earliest
possible
trial
date
changed
between
when
the
motion
was
filed
and
when
the
motion
was
resolved.
and
how
would
they
take
into
account
other
periods
of
time
that
might
exclude
delay
--
might
exclude
--
that
might
be
excludable
also?
for
example,
say
a
court
gets
two
motions
filed
at
the
same
time.
trial
could
start
in
5
days
absent
the
motion.
one
motion's
going
to
take
3
days
to
resolve;
the
other
motion's
going
to
take
4
days
to
resolve.
what's
the
court
supposed
to
do?
is
one
--
is
the
3-day
motion
excluded?
is
the
4-day
motion
excluded?
are
both
of
the
motions
excluded?
does
it
depend
on
the
order
in
which
the
court
decides
them?
it
just
is
not
possible
for
a
court
to
make
these
determinations.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i
--
i
can't
point
to
anything
particular,
but
there's
been
no
outcry
that
--
that
there's
been
a
problem
from
pretrial
motions
being
filed
as
a
--
as
an
attempt
to
extend
the
speedy
trial
act
deadline.
the
court's
been
--
the
--
congress
has
reviewed
the
speedy
trial
act's
operation
in
the
past.
it
made
changes
in
1979
to
address
problems
that
have
occurred.
it
hasn't
felt
the
need
to
address
this
problem
since,
and
there's
no
evidence
of
any
abuse
of
the
automatic
exclusion
on
the
other
side.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
first,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
--
that
hood
adopted
any
such
rule.
the
motion--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it
suggests
that
there
might
be
that
qualification.
i
think
that
the
statute
provides
that
the
--
that
any
pretrial
motion
tolls
the
deadline,
regardless
of
the
purpose
for
which
it's
filed.
but,
of
course,
if
--
in
the
unlikely
event
that
a
prosecutor
did
file
a
motion
solely
to
extend
the
deadline
and
avoid
proceeding
to
trial,
that
conduct
would
be
sanctionable
under
--
under
the
act,
under
section
3162(b)(4).
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
attorney
could
be
sanctioned
for
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
the
--
the
court
doesn't
need
to
put
off
trial
just
because
time
is
excluded,
your
honor,
and
the
court
has
other
mechanisms
that
it
can
use--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
the
statute
provides
the
circumstances
in
which
time
is
excludable
and
in
which
time
is
not,
and
it
doesn't
create
an
exception
for
certain
kinds
of
motions.
it
applies
to
any
pretrial
motion.
but
i
have
to
say,
there's
been
no
evidence
over
the
30
years
that
anything
like
this
is
happening,
and
in
hood
itself,
the
motion
was
filed
by
defense
counsel,
and
the
court
was
simply
saying
that
this
is
not
--
that
that's
not
what's
going
on
here,
there's
no
suggestion
that
this
motion
is
part
of
a
process
to
try
to
frustrate
the
act.
there's
--
the
problem
just
hasn't
arisen.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
the
court
--
the
court
does
decline
to
address
questions
if
it
doesn't
consider
them
of
sufficient
importance
to
--
general
importance
to
warrant
a
review.
nobles
is
one
example.
there
are
others
cited
in
stern
and
gressman.
but
the
reason
that
this
issue
is
not
of
any
ongoing
importance
is
that
the
rules
have
been
amended.
it
now
expressly
applies
to
statutes
like
this
one
that
don't
specify
a
method
for
counting
time.
and,
you
know,
turning
to
the
merits
of
the
issue,
also
--
one
other
point
on
the
importance
of
it.
the
circuits
all
have
adopted
the
same
approach
as
the
court
of
appeals
here,
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--two
other
circuits,
but
there
aren't
any
that
have
--
that
have
held
to
the
contrary.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
think
it
would
render
it
dictum,
your
honor.
the
court
can
address
issues
in
--
in
whatever
order
it
chooses
to,
and
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
--
the
decisions
that
you
make
along
the
way
aren't
precedential
and
binding
if
they're
part
of
the
rationale
to
get
there.
but
we
would
--
we
don't
think--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
your
honor,
the
respondent
offered
this
argument
as
a
ground
not
to
grant
certiorari
in
its
--
in
his
brief
in
opposition.
the
court
nonetheless
took
the
case.
the
circuits
are
divided
on
this
--
this
issue--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
i
think
you
could
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
think
that
it
would
be
impermissible
for
--
for
the
court
to
decide
the
issues
in
that
order,
but
if
you
think
so
and
you
think
that
that's
a
reason--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
can
see
how
you
might
think
so.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
the
courts
of
appeals
would
follow
it.
but
--
but
i'm
not
arguing
that
you
should
just--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i'm
not
trying
to
argue
you
should
decide
the
issue.
we
don't
think
you
should
decide
the
issue.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
exactly.
you
wouldn't
have
granted
cert
on
the
question.
it's
of
no
continuing
importance.
it's
not
going
to
affect
cases
going
forward,
and
there's
no
reason
for
the
court
to
reach
out
and
decide
it.
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
decided
the
question.
the
--
the
statute
doesn't
specify
whether
the
10
days
are
calendar
days
or
business
days,
and
it's
therefore
reasonable
to
infer
that
congress
expected
that
the
--
that
the
courts
would
interpret
the
provision
in
accordance
with
the
counting
rules
that
are
applicable
in
similar
criminal
contexts.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
believe
what
happened
is
the
court
ordered
--
the
court
ordered
on
the
2nd
that
there
should
be
a
competency
examination.
on
the
10th,
the
--
the
bop
designated
that
the
mcc
would
be
where
the
competency
examination--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--would
take
place.
yes.
and
on
then
the
10th
was,
as
it
turns
out,
was
a
thursday
before
veterans
day.
then
there
was
veterans
day,
and
november
12th
and
13th
were
the
weekend.
so
on
the
next
monday
the
marshals
service
asked
the
justice
transportation
service
to
transport
the
defendant.
but
the
way
these
things
worked
is
that
when
there
are
interdistrict
transportation,
they
use
airlifts
that
go
around
the
country;
and
the
airlifts
go
--
there
are
two
flights
a
day.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
they
make
three
stops.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
rules--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--changed
the
rule--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--for
--
for
rule
45,
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
we
do.
we
think
that
they--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--because
at
the
time,
that
wasn't
--
at
the
time
that
--
that
the
transportation
was
done
then--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
think
--
i
think
that
--
that
at
the
time
that
was
the
method
that
--
that
dictated
the
transportation
for
him,
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--retroactively--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--because
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
--
a
rule
of
law
that
we're
talking
about.
it's
the
counting
of
the
time,
and
it's
impossible
for
a
court
to
anticipate--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that's
right.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
agree.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
agree
completely,
your
honor.
while,
i
think--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
don't
think
that
you
--
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
new
rule
of
law
that
you're
talking
about.
this
is
how
the
--
this
is
--
is
the
counting
method.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we
--
we
don't
want
the
--
we
don't
want
the
new
rule.
we're
just
telling
you--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--what
we
think
the
rule,
what
the
rule
means.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
your
honor.
our
argument
is
not
that
the
rule
by
its
terms
applies.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
i
like
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
like
the
way
we're
going.
[laughter]
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there's
no
plain
meaning.
"days"
sometimes
can
mean
business
days;
they
can
sometimes
mean
calendar
days,
and
as
i
said
before--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
--
i
don't
know
whether
it's
used
business
days
or
not.
respondent
does
point
out
that
there
are
some
statutes
that
contain
specific
exclusions
of
weekends
and
holidays,
but
those
statutes
were--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
that
the
statute
always
meant
the
same
thing,
and
that
it
meant
that
10
days
should
be
interpreted
in
light
of
whatever
the
background
rule
is
at
the
time
for
counting
the
time.
and
so
there's
no
--
there's
no
new
rule;
at
the
time
the
10
days
meant
exclude
the
weekends
and
holidays,
and
now
because
the
background
rule
has
changed,
it
means
count
the
weekends,
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no,
i
don't
think
congress
changed
its
mind.
congress
wanted
the
--
the
statute
to--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
i
think
that
--
that
my
point
is
that
when
it
doesn't
specify
whether
it's
business
or
calendar
days,
that
congress
anticipated
the
courts
would
say,
okay,
let's
look
to
the
background
rule;
and
the
place,
the
sensible
place
to
look
to
the
background
rule
is
the
rule
--
is
a
rule
of
criminal
procedure
in
analogous
contexts.
in
fact,
courts
frequently
do
that
when
they're
trying
to
interpret
statutes
to
figure
out
what
the
10-day
limit
is/as
many
of
the
--
many
of
the
cases
cited
in
the
alr
article
that
respondent
cites
show.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
your
honor,
generally
the
flights
don't
occur
on
the
weekends
or
holidays.
that
was
sort
of
what
i
was
trying
to
explain
in
my
extended
digression
to
the
chief
--
to
the
chief
justice
before.
the
bop
doesn't
admit
and
discharge
prisoners
on
the
weekends.
in
addition,
there
are
various
other
factors
that
--
that
go
into
the
need
to
have
two
--
two
deputy
marshals
transporting
people.
so
the
transportation
doesn't
generally
occur
on
the
weekends.
and
it's
because
of
the
weekends
and
holidays
that
the
transportation
of
the
defendant
actually
took
the
amount
of
time
that
it
--
that
it
did
here.
but
i
would
say,
as
i
started,
in
urging
you
not
to
address
this
issue,
which
is
of
no
ongoing
importance,
that
the
question
that
we
did
ask
the
court
to
address
and
that
the
court
granted
review
on
is
a
very
important
question
that's
divided
the
circuits;
and
that
allowing
the
rule
that
the
court
below
adopted
to
continue
to
stand
could
frustrate
the
application
of
the
speedy
trial
act,
not
only
with
respect
to
the
pretrial
motions
exclusion
but
potentially
with
respect
to
all
the
other
automatic
exclusions;
and
i
think
it's
very
important
that
the
court
correct
this
error
and
reaffirm
the
established
rule.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
i
would
like
to
stress
that
the
government
thinks
that
it's
very
important
that
the
court
address
the
question
that
we
raised
in
our
cert
petition,
and
that
the
court
granted
certiorari
to
answer,
on
which
there's
a
split
in
the
circuits
and
which
we
believe
that
if
it's
left
standing
will
result
in
serious
disruption
to
the
speedy
trial
act.
turning
to
--
to
that
question,
a
few
points
first.
respondent's
definition
of
delay
is
plainly
inconsistent
with
henderson
which
already
holds
that
the
period
of
delay
that's
excludable
is
the
time
between
the
filing
of
the
motion
and
the
disposition
of
the
motion.
that
can't
be
squared
with
the
notion
that
delay
is
the
period
during
which
trial
is
postponed.
second,
respondent's
definition
of
delay
gives
delay
a
different
meaning
in
the
first
part
of
the
statute
and
in
subsection
d,
where
this
court's
already
held
that
it
has
the
meaning
that
we
suggest.
third,
respondent's
test
is
totally
unworkable,
because
you
can't
tell
at
the
time
a
motion
is
filed
how
much
time
it's
going
to
take
to
resolve
and
whether
trial
is
going
to
be
postponed.
district
court
judges
have
over
500
pending
cases
on
their
docket,
an
average
district
court
judge.
a
hundred
of
them
are
criminal.
the
court
--
the
speedy
trial
act
cannot
function
if
the
judges
are
going
to
have
to
make
a
complex
judicial
determination
in
each
case
to
determine
whether
each
motion
is
excludable.
respondent
says
that
nacdl
says
defendants
won't
object
or
that
they'll
stipulate
to
the
exclusion
of
time,
but
nacdl
also
says
that
defendants
may
change
their
mind
if
the
case
goes
to
trial,
and
if
they
change
their
mind
and
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
under
the
speedy
trial
act,
their
prior
failures
to
object
and
stipulations
may
very
well
not
be
binding
because
this
court
held
in
zedner
that
defendants
can
prospectively
waive
the
application
of
the
act.
and
respondent's
tests
would
also
throw
the
established
way
that
the
speedy
trial
act
has
been
operating
for
over
30
years
into
disarray.
turning
to
whether
this
court
has
to
address
the
alternative
arguments
for
affirmance,
nobles
plainly
says
that
the
court
has
discretion
not
to
address
those
issues
if
those
issues
are
not
independently
worthy
of
certiorari.
it
doesn't
base
that
on
the
fact
that
the
--
on
the
fact
that
the
argument
would
expand
the
judgment
below,
and
the
rule
that
it's
discretionary
makes
sense,
because
the
contrary
rule
would
require
the
court
to
address
numerous
issues
that
are
not
important
and
--
in
every
case
where
they're
raised,
and
would
also
lead
the
court
to
either
dismiss
writs
as
improvidently
granted
or
to
address
only
as
dicta
important
issues
on
which
the
court
has
granted
certiorari.
finally--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
i
think
that
we
would
like
the
court
to
address
the
issue
on
which
cert
was
granted.
we
think
it's
a
very
important
issue.
we
think
that
the
courts
of
appeals
would
follow
it
even
if
it
might
technically
be
viewed
as
dicta.
we
would
think
that
it
would
be
an
alternative
holding
or
ratio
decidendi.
