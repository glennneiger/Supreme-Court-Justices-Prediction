justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
on
that
issue,
do
you
accept
the
first
circuit's
rule
in
u.s.
v.
hood
that
if
the
government
is
found
to
be
attempting
to
frustrate
the
operation
of
the
speedy
trial
act,
that
those
motions
and
their
delays
won't
be
counted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
suggests
that
qualification?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
sanctionable
against
the
government,
or--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
does
that
help
a
defendant
whose
speedy
trial
rights
have
been
violated?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
haven't
answered
my
question.
the
rights
that
this
statute
protects
are
the
rights
to
have
your
trial
start
within
70
days
absent
or
extended
to
these
exclusions.
if
the
government
frustrates
that
and
makes
the
trial
start
later,
why
shouldn't
a
defendant
have
the
benefit
of
the
act
and
have
the
indictment
dismissed
with
or
without
prejudice?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
hope
you
won't
sit
down
without
addressing
the
(h)(1)(f)
issue
and
explain
why
we
shouldn't
reach
it,
because
the
issue
is,
as
i
see
it,
one
of
law,
not
like
nobles,
one
of
discretion.
and
although
you
say
it's
unimportant
because
of
a
change
in
rule
45,
how
could
any
criminal
conviction
that's
inappropriate
be
unimportant
to
the
defendant
or
insignificant
enough
for
this
court
to
address
the
question
once
the
case
is
before
us?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--there's
a
lot--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
there's
a
lot
of
discussion
about
the
applicability
or
nonapplicability
of
this
rule
to
this
case.
the
rule
by
its
terms
applies
to
computing
any
period
of
time
specified
in
these
rules,
any
local
rule
or
any
court
order.
none
of
that
includes
the
statute
at
issue
here,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
this
whole
debate
about
whether
the
rule
applies
or
not
is
irrelevant.
the
only
question
is
what
does
the
statute
intend,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
if
what
the
statute
intends
hasn't
changed--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--between
the
old
rule
or
the
revised
rule,
correct?
congress
hasn't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--made
an
amendment;
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
will
you
like
the
way
we're
going
if
i
accept
your
proposition
that
when
congress
uses
10
days,
it
really
means
10
business
days?
i
take
words
in
a
statute
like
that
at
their
plain
meaning.
it
says
10
days,
not
10
business
days.
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
congress
has
used
10
--
has
used
business
days
in
other
provisions,
hasn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
congress
changed
its
mind
between
the
two
rules?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
i
know
that?
where?
rule
45
doesn't
apply
to
statutes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
in
the
statute
does
it
--
say,
apply
the
criminal
rules?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me,
but
isn't
that
what
the
statute
says?
meaning,
if
you
look
at
(h),
the
beginning
paragraph
at
(h),
it
says,
"the
following
periods
of
delay
shall
be
excluded
in
computing
the
time
within
which
the
trial
of
any
such
offense
must
commence.
"
it's
not
talking
about
the
delay
of
the
trial.
it's
talking
about
the
computation
of
the
start
date
for
the
trial.
so
if
that's
what
that
commands
you
to
do,
doesn't
--
isn't
only
the
solicitor
general's
position
consistent
with
that?
it's
telling
you
to
take
the
periods
of
delay
and
compute
the
date
the
trial
must
start
by
excluding
those.
that's
the
language.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
but
that's
what
(h)
says;
(h)
says
you
compute
the
start
date
of
the
trial,
when
it
must
start,
by
excluding
all
of
these
periods
of
delay.
it's
defining
it
for
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
doesn't
matter
how
substantial
and
important
a
motion
is,
whether
it
was
your
motion
to
dismiss
for
speedy
trial
act
reasons
or
the
administrative
motions
here
that
you
say
really
didn't
require
time?
it
doesn't
matter;
all
that
matters
is
keeping
track
from
day
one,
the
commencement
of
the
trial,
as
to
when
the
court
is
about
to
set
the
trial
date,
that
it
does
it
at
the
end
of
all
the
motions.
that's
the
only
time
the
court
can
do
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
wouldn't
it
matter?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
actually
it
happens
all
the
time.
in
the
"rocket
docket"
in
virginia,
the
court
sets
a
trial
date,
and
you
file
whatever
motions
you're
going
to
file.
under
your
theory,
until
that
last
motion
actually
delays
the
trial
date,
none
of
those
motions
exclude
time.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
don't
believe
i
had
a
trial
in
my
district
court
days
where
between
the
time
i
had
the
pretrial
conference
and
the
time
trial
started,
there
wasn't
a
slew
of
motions,
because
that's
about
the
time
counsel
tends
to
wake
up.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay?
and
--
and
decide
that
really
now
they've
got
to
get
ready.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
should
we
care
whether
it's
an
administrative
motion
or
simply
to
clarify
the
functioning
of
the
trial?
why
should
we
not
exclude
those
times,
because
those
--
those
motions,
whether
they're
administrative
or
not,
will
cause
the
trial
to
go
faster,
because
issues
that
would
otherwise
consume
the
time
of
the
court
during
trial
are
being
resolved
before
trial.
