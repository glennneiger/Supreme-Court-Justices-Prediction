it's
not
part
of
the
rationale.
the
rationale
for
our
decision
would
be
(h)(1)(d)
alone,
and
all
the
other
discussion
would
be
perfectly
gratuitous,
because
we're
going
to
set
this
individual
free
anyway.
to
say,
well,
this
other
thing
is
not
a
good
reason
to
set
them
free,
but
this
one
is,
i
mean,
that
--
the
former
is
just
utterly
irrelevant
to
our
decision.
justice

scalia
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
you.
i'm
trying
to
help
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
it's
not
impermissible,
but
i'm
also
sure
that
if
we
do
it,
what
we
say
about
the
ground
for
which
we
took
the
case
would
be
--
would
be
the
purest
dictum.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
their
fault;
they
shouldn't
follow
dictum,
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
you
want
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--may
i
suggest
that
perhaps
the
reason
not
to
do
it
is,
assuming
this
person
was
treated
entirely
fairly
on
the
basis
of
the
law
that
existed
at
the
time,
the
consequence
of
what
justice
breyer
proposes
is
to
set
free
someone
who
has
been
duly
convicted
of
a
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
to
do
that
simply
because,
although
the
--
the
process
was
perfectly
fair
when
it
was
applied,
there's
been
a
change
in
the
rule
and
therefore
we
don't
redo
it,
but
we
let
this
person
go;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
can't
be
tried
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
agree
with
that.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
relying
on
the
2009--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
say
--
you
say
this
was
wrong
when
it
was
decided?
justice
antonin
scalia
regardless
of
the
2009?

mr.

--
delay,
you
make
an
argument
about
the
meaning
of
delay.
i
am
troubled
by
the
meaning
of
the
"from
the
filing
of
the
motion.
"
of
that
clause.
you
read
that,
i
think,
to
mean
delay
resulting
from
any
pretrial
moment
and
not
to
exceed
--
right
--
the
period
from
the
filing
of
the
filing
of
the
motion
to
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing.
right?
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
where
do
you
--
where
to
you
get
that
"not
to
exceed"?
it
doesn't
say
not
to
exceed;
it
says
delay
resulting
from
the
filing
of
the
motion.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
funny
way
to
say
it.
