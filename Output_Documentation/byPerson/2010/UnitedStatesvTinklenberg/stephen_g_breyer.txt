justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
--
is
it
right
that
the
rules
committee
then
changed
it,
and
it
basically
said
the
way
the
defendant
here
thinks
it
should
be
is
that's
what
it
should
be?
isn't
that
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay
--
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
rules
committee
said
count
calendar
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
changed
the
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
you
think
that
the
federal
courts
are
right
in
saying,
judge,
when
you
have
a
speedy
trial
act
case,
look
to
rule
45;
you
think
that's
right
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
why
shouldn't
this
defendant
whose
case
was
on
appeal
get
the
advantage
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
it
was
under
a
different
rule.
but
where
--
normally
with
cases
where
you
have
a
new
rule
come
in,
it
does
apply
to
the
advantage
of
the
people
who
were
then
on
appeal.
is
there
something
special
about
this,
that
federal
rules
don't,
or
you
just
--
too
bad,
we
thought
it
was
a
really
erroneous
thing
that
they
had,
we
used
to
have,
and
we've
corrected
it,
but
just
--
he's
still
on
appeal,
it
doesn't
apply
to
him?
is
there
some
law
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand.
i
understand
they
followed
the
rule
at
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they've
changed
the
rule.
his
case
is
still
on
appeal.
why
shouldn't
he
get
the
advantage
of
the
new
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
wasn't
anybody's
fault.
why
shouldn't
we
go
back
and
say
do
it
again,
and
now,
let's
--
since
his
case
is
still
on
appeal,
it's
the
same
question.
what's
the
argument
against
doing
that?
why
can't
we?
i'm
sure
there's
some
rule
out
there
that
says
we
can't
do
this,
but
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
because
it
seems
fair.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
any
other
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i'm
thinking
that
we
normally
--
although
all
this
is
quite
true,
what
justice
scalia
says,
normally
we
do
apply
new
rules
to
those
who
are
on
appeal
at
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
matters
because
the
trial
judges
have
to
know
what
to
do,
and
while
your
reading
might
fit
the
language
in
ordinary
english
better,
i
think
it
does.
it's
also
possible
to
read
those
words
"delay
resulting
from"
as
simply
referring
to
a
period
of
time;
and
the
statute
is
saying
these
periods
of
time
are
excluded
from
accounting.
now,
the
virtue
of
that
is
just
what
justice
ginsburg
started
with;
all
the
trial
judges
know
how
to
do
it;
the
lawyers
don't
get
mixed
up;
and
the
problem
with
what
you're
arguing
for,
in
my
mind
--
if
you
want
to
say
anything
more
about
it,
do
--
is
that
it
seems
very
unworkable
to
strike
trying
to
figure
out
what
causes
what.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
one,
united
states
v.
tinklenberg
involves
the
speedy
trial
act
of
1974,
which
requires
that
a
criminal
trial
begins
70
days
after
the
arraignment.
it
then
list
a
long
set
of
exclusions
from
that
70-day
count,
so
you
have
to
have
seventy
non-excludable
days.
now,
one
of
those
exclusions
--
is
"a
delay
resulting
from
any
pretrial
motion,
from
the
filing
of
the
motion
through
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
on,
or
other
prompt
disposition
of
such
motions,"
so
it
says,
don't
suppose
to
exclude
it,
you
get
an
extra
plus
the
70-days
plus.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
sixth
circuit
found
that
the
3(d)
act
of
--
the
speedy
trial
act
was
violated.
there
had
more
than
seventy
non-excludable
days
had
passed.
hence,
but
in
doing
that,
it
counted,
that
means
it
didn't
exclude
several
critical
days
following
certain
pretrial
motions,
and
falling
within
the
period
"from
the
filing
of
the
motion
through
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
on
or
other
prompt
disposition
of
the
motion".
now,
the
circuit
reasoned
that
the
particular
pretrial
motions
at
issue
did
not
cause
a
delay
in
the
beginning
of
tinklenberg's
trial.
the
trial
began
just
for
--
and
it
would've
begun
without
the
pretrial
motions,
and
the
court
said
that
matters
because
the
statutory
language
excludes
only
"delay
resulting
from
pretrial
motions."
if
there
is
no
delay
at
recent,
there
is
no
exclusion.
in
our
view
however,
the
words
"delay
resulting
from"
which
are
present
at
the
beginning
of
almost
every
statutory
phrase
that
announces
an
exclusion,
do
not
require
nor
do
they
permit
a
judge
to
decide
in
each
particular
case
whether
a
pretrial
motion
did,
or
did
not
in
fact
delay
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
rather,
congress
did
the
deciding
here.
it
believed
that
the
circumstances
listed
in
the
exclusion
do
normally
cause
delay,
and
it
intended
the
periods
of
time
specified
in
the
exclusion
before
us
following
a
pretrial
motion
to
apply
automatically,
irrespective
of
whether
the
motion
does
or
does
not
postpone
the
particular
trial
at
issue
in
a
particular
case.
now,
we
base
that
conclusion
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
read
in
full
context,
and
interpreted
in
light
of
its
structure
and
purposes.
and
we
note
that
the
sixth
circuit's
contrary
interpretation
would
make
the
statute
much
more
difficult
for
trial
judges
to
administer.
we
also
note
that
for
the
past
several
decades,
all
other
circuits
have
interpreted
the
statute
as
we
interpret
it
today.
now,
we
go
on
to
decide
another
issue,
even
though
the
respondent
jason
tinklenberg
losses
his
argument
about
excluding
pretrial
motion
days,
he
wins
an
offsetting
claim.
he
points
out
that
the
statute
excludes
days
used
to
transport
defendants
to
medical
exams,
but
it
says
you
can't
exclude
more
than
ten
of
those.
but
he
will
have
more
days
spent
transporting,
and
interpreting
how
many
days
in
excess
of
ten
were
spent
transporting
tinklenberg,
days
that
were
not
excludable
from
the
speedy
trial
act
70-day
count,
add
them
on.
the
court
did
not
count
weekend
days
and
holidays.
well,
i
don't
know
why
they
didn't,
we
say.
and
we
agree
with
tinklenberg
that
those
weekend
days
and
holidays
are
not
excludable
and
they
should
count
as
part
of
the
seventy
days
non-excludable
days
which
passed
before
he
went
to
trial.
so
tinklenberg
consequently
wins
his
basic
claim
that
the
speedy
trial
act
was
violated.
we
explain
all
these
more
thoroughly
in
our
opinion.
as
i
said,
we
disagree
with
two
separate
aspects
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided,
that
those
two
determinations
that
we
find
erroneous
in
a
sense,
cancel
each
other
out.
and
we
consequently
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
ultimate
finding
of
the
speedy
trial
act
violation.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
have
joined.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
