justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
far
we
are
just
discussing,
i
take
it,
whether
under
(1)
the
other
side
is
entitled
to
their
benefits
even
if
they
weren't
hurt,
on
a
contract
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
i
thought
we
took
the
case
to
decide
a
different
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
is:
i
will
assume
you
are
right,
it
should
have
come
under
(3),
but
i
don't
know
if
that
is
harmful,
whether
it
was
(3)
or
(1).
and
the
question
i
thought
we
were
to
decide
was,
if
you
are
under
(3),
say,
where
equity
is
at
issue,
now
equity
is
at
issue
and
the
district
court
says:
here
we
have
27,000
people,
and
now
here's
how
i'm
going
to
go
about
this.
i'm
going
to
look
at
this
provision
mistake
here,
and
the
mistake
it
seems
to
me
was
likely
to
cause
some
harm.
and
once
that
is
shown
--
and
they
showed
it,
it's
likely
to
cause
it
harm;
we
can't
be
sure,
but
it's
likely
--
then
it's
up
to
your
client
to
refute
case
by
case
that
these
guys
or
women
were
not
really
harmed.
okay?
now,
that
seems
very
sensible
to
me.
and
if
that's
the
issue
we're
going
to
decide,
i
would
like
to
hear
you
explain
why
that
isn't
sensible.
it's
an
equitable
matter.
this
is
simply
a
way
of
going
about
it.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree,
but
i
don't
understand
--
i'm
with
you
on
this
one
so
far.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
sounding
to
me
as
if
you
are
saying
there
wasn't
likely
harm.
okay.
are
you
conceding
that
the
standard
that
they
used,
the
standard
was
--
the
question
that
you
raised
at
the
beginning,
whether
--
whether
the
showing
of
likely
harm
is
sufficient
in
the
absence
of
a
rebuttal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that's
what
i
want
to
hear:
what's
the
argument
against
that
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
"likely
harm"
capture
that
idea?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
that's
the
kind
of
harm
they
mean.
what
they
mean
by
harm
is
they
were
hurt,
brought
about
by
reliance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
object
to
this
decision,
saying
the
following:
of
course,
the
lower
court
said
likely
harm
is
necessary.
as
we
understand
it,
given
the
context
of
equity,
what
that
means
here
is
that
there
is
reason
to
believe
--
reason
to
believe
--
it
was
probable
that,
or
some
words
like
that,
that
there
would
have
been
harm
caused
by
reliance
on
the
misstatement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
it
wouldn't
be
too
hard.
they
are
joined
as
members
of
the
class
in
light
of
a
certain
set
of
characteristics
and
the
judge
would
find
that,
other
things
being
equal,
individuals
who
have
that
set
of
characteristics
which
in
this
circumstance
make
them
members
of
the
class
would
be
harmed
in
all
likelihood,
okay?
done.
now,
it's
up
to
--
it's
up
to
the
--
the
defendant
then
to
show
that
in
a
particular
case
this
individual
wasn't
harmed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
depends
on
the
facts.
maybe
they'd
have
a
union--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
finished
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
are
finished:
as
i
understand
what
you
have
been
saying
and
written,
you
don't
mean
that
the
spd,
the
summary,
is
a
contract?
i
mean,
one
thing
would
be
to
say
it's
a
part
of
the
plan
and
moreover
it's
a
contract,
so
therefore
we
enforce
it
according
to
terms.
that's
one
view.
but
if
you
took
that
view,
you
get
into
problems
such
as
were
mentioned.
the
employer
would
write
10,000
pages
because
he
knows
it's
an
enforceable
contract.
nobody
would
understand
it.
you
would
have
to
worry
about
the
time
when
it
was
less
favorable
than
the
written
document.
so
call
it
a
plan
if
you
want,
as
long
as
you
don't
mean
it's
an
enforceable
contract.
now,
there
is
a
provision
that
deals
with
it,
saying
just
what
you
said
in
response
to
justice
alito.
and
what
i
don't
understand
is
why
wouldn't
that
provision
govern?
i
take
it
there's
a
provision,
1054(g)(1),
that
says
a
plan
cannot
reduce
the
rate
of
accrual
of
future
benefits
unless
there
is
written
notice
in
a
manner
calculated
to
be
understood
by
the
average
plan
participant.
so
i
would
have
thought,
i
read
that,
i
get
what
you've
said
in
your
brief.
the
summary
was
inadequate.
it
wouldn't
have
been
understood,
and
therefore,
according
to
this
particular
provision,
those
provisions
in
the
plan
that
reduce
benefits
are
void.
so
now
we
enforce
the
plan
with
the
--
in
the
absence
of
those
particular
void
provisions,
and
you
get
what
you
want.
now,
i
thought
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to
me,
except
i
don't
see
that
anywhere
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there's
some
reason
it
doesn't
seem
to
appear
in
the
opinions.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
briefs.
it
doesn't
appear
anywhere
until
you
just
mentioned
it
in
response
to
justice
alito,
or
seemed
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
(h).
he's
right,
it's
(h).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that.
so
suppose
we
can't
reach
that,
which
would
seem
to
be
the
logical
thing
to
govern
this,
but
we
can't,
okay.
then
we
only
have
two
choices.
the
first
choice
is
(1)(b),
which
seems
to
--
you
want
to
use
that
by
treating
the
summary
as
a
contract,
or
we
go
to
(3),
in
which
case
we
are
under
equity.
now,
between
those
two,
the
first
one
gets
all
the
problems
that
we
just
were
talking
about.
the
second
one
would
seem
to
be
you
are
free
and
clear
as
long
as
you
show
some
kind
of
reliance
and
harm,
and
then
we
are
back
to
what
i
thought
we
granted
this
for,
which
is
why
not
say
if
harm
is
likely
then
the
burden
shifts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
in
a
trust
law
where,
let's
say,
there
are
10
or
50,000
beneficiaries
in
a
trust,
and
--
and
the
trustee
has
indeed
made
an
error.
and
now
they
can
recover
money
only
if,
only
if
there
really
has
been
harm.
now,
how
does
--
how
does
trust
law
work
that
out?
this
can't
be
the
first
time
this
ever
arose
in
history.
we
have
a
big
class.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
they
here
have
gone
--
could
they
also
have
said
to
the
company:
look,
why
are
you
doing
this?
if
interest
rates
fall,
we
are
going
to
lose
money.
but
interest
rates
might
rise,
and
if
interest
rates
rise,
you'll
lose
money.
so
we're
risk-averse,
so
what
we
would
like
to
do
is
just
make
sure
we
get
the
same
pension
that
we
would
under
plan
a,
and
then
if
there
is
more
on
plan
b
add
it
in,
and
we'll
risk
the
fact
that
interest
rates
might
have
gone
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
could
--
they
might
have
talked
the
company
into
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
spd
is
written
by
the
fiduciary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
other
is
written
by
the
--
by
the
person
who
is
giving
the
money,
the
employer.
so
now
you
are
saying
that
it's
a
contract,
even
though
it
wasn't
written
by
the
employer,
and
even
though
it
could
differ
in
dozens
of
ways
from
the
actual
--
from
the
actual
plan
document.
sometimes
they
would
be
favorable
to
the
employee,
sometimes
they
would
be
unfavorable,
sometimes
they
would
be
different
but
neutral.
so
what's
the
judge
supposed
to
do?
forget
about
the
basic
document
and
just
enforce
this
thing
written
by
the
fiduciary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
said
that
there
can
be
conflicts,
sometimes
favorable
to
the
employee,
sometimes
unfavorable,
sometimes
neutral.
so
what
we
have
is
a
document
that's,
by
the
way,
supposed
to
be
short,
but
i
guess
if
we
took
your
view
it
wouldn't
be
short
anymore.
and
--
and
it
--
it
could
differ
in
any
one
of
three
ways;
and
i
could
think
of
seven
other
ways.
so
--
and
we'll
find
seven
others.
so
what
--
how
is
a
judge
supposed
to
react?
he's
supposed
to
say
that
this
twopage
document
is
the
contract,
is
the
contract,
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
conflicts
--
what's
supposed
to
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
my
question.
my
question
is:
one,
why
should
a
document
written
by
a
different
person,
the
fiduciary,
govern
over
the
actual
plan?
second,
what
happens
when
you
have
a
favorable
conflict,
what
happens
when
you
have
an
unfavorable
conflict,
what
happens
when
you
have
a
neutral
conflict?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
should
it
be
worked
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
the
fact
that
this
individual
in
this
case
happened
to
be
the
same
group
or
person
is
beside
the
point
of
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
true
of
the
certificate
of
insurance?
is
a
certificate
of
insurance
a
simple
document
that
any
consumer
is
able
to
understand
or
--
or
is
supposed
to
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
an
example
that
i
can
look
at?
find
one,
on
line
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--does
it
control
when
it's
less
favorable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
only
controls
when
it's
more
favorable,
but
not
when
it's
less
favorable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
theory
of
contract
law
gets
you
to
that
conclusion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
(j).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
still
have
the
same
question
justice
scalia
had,
which
is
why
didn't
this
(h)
thing
apply
here,
because
they
didn't
have,
their
claim,
the
notice
wasn't
good,
and
if
the
notice
wasn't
good
then
the
plan
didn't
change,
and
if
the
plan
didn't
change
they
should
have
gotten
the
money.
why
didn't
it
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
a
erisa
pension
case
which
means
it's
pretty
complicated.
but
in
the
case,
petitioner
was
a
company
called
cigna
runs
a
pension
plan
for
its
employees
and
the
plan
is
governed
by
erisa,
the
employment
retirement
security
act
of
18
--
1974.
now
under
erisa,
participants
in
a
pension
plan
are
entitled
to
get
periodic
summaries
of
their
benefits
and
obligations.
in
1997,
cigna
decided
to
change
its
pension
plan
and
it
sent
notices
to
the
plan
participants
but
the
notices
omitted
certain
key
details
about
reductions
of
the
rate
that
employees
would
accrue
benefits
in
the
future.
and
in
particular,
it
--
they
--
cigna
did
not
tell
its
employees
that
--
because
of
a
mathematical
core
of
a
certain
kind,
the
way
in
which
the
--
they
were
going
to
calculate
those
benefits.
those
employees
could
work
many
years
without
accruing
any
additional
benefits.
after
the
bench
trial,
the
district
court
found
that
cigna's
disclosures
violated
erisa.
so,
there's
a
violation,
but
what's
the
remedy?
cigna
claimed
that
there
is
no
remedy
unless
the
participants
proved
that
they
relied
upon
the
misstatements
to
their
detriment.
the
district
court
found
there
could
be
a
remedy.
if
the
false
disclosures
resulted
in
likely
harm
to
the
plan
participants
and
it
said,
"well,
the
participants
here
can
get
--
recover
the
benefits
because
--
under
a
remedy
provision,
502(a)(1)(b)",
which
i'm
going
to
call
remedy
prong
one.
that
prong
one
permits
the
participant,
“to
recover
benefits
due
to
him
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.”
so,
the
second
circuit
affirmed
to
get
the
remedy.
but
we
granted
cert
to
determine
what
standard
of
harm
the
participants
have
to
satisfy.
is
it
as
the
district
court
thought
likely
harm?
or
is
it
as
cigna
said
reliance
to
ones
detriment?
but
we
first
found
that
we
have
to
consider
whether
the
district
court
should
have
treated
the
summary
benefit
descriptions
under
remedy
prong
one.
was
this
whole
thing
benefits
due
under
the
terms
of
the
plan?
well,
so
now
what
do
we
hold?
well,
in
a
sense
we
hold
that
that
prong
one,
benefits
due
under
the
plan
in
this
case
is
the
wrong
prong.
the
district
court's
remedy
consisted
of
two
steps.
the
first
step
was
to
reform
the
terms
of
the
plan
to
comport
with
the
summary
documents.
the
second
was
to
make
cigna
enforce
the
plan
as
it
was
rewritten.
now
that
second
step
is
certainly
part
of
enforcing
the
plan
benefits
but
we
don't
see
how
changing
the
plan
can
be
part
of
--
in
giving
them
the
benefits
due
under
the
plan.
so
where
does
the
district
court
get
the
authority
to
do
that?
well,
the
failure
of
the
district
court
to
bring
us
remedy
within
prong
one
does
not
mean
that
the
participants
are
necessarily
out
of
luck.
that's
because
there's
another
remedial
provision,
502(a)(3)
called
prong
two
and
that
permits
the
participants
to
obtain,
“other
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
redress
erisa
violations.”
the
district
court
thought
that
that
relief
was
unavailable
but
we
disagree.
under
one
of
our
earlier
cases
called
mertens,
the
phrase
appropriate
equitable
relief
refers
to
those
categories
of
relief
that
before
the
merger
of
law
and
equity
were
typically
available
in
equity.
and
so
we
looked
it
up
and
we
found
that
there
are
at
least
three
remedies
here
from
equity,
consistent
with
what
the
district
court
did.
it
might
satisfy
the
standard.
courts
in
equity
use
to
reform
an
instrument
to
reflect
the
parties'
mutual
intent.
they
used
to
be
able
to
stop
a
party
from
benefiting
from
its
factor
misrepresentations.
and
they
used
to
be
able
to
surcharge
awarding
money
damages
against
the
trustee
for
a
breach
of
his
duty.
we'll
leave
it
to
the
district
court
to
determine
which
if
any
of
these
remedies
is
appropriate
in
light
of
the
facts
of
this
case
and
that
leaves
us
with
the
question
we
initially
agreed
to
decide,
whether
showing
of
likely
harm
is
sufficient
under
erisa.
for
purposes
of
this
prong
two,
we
conclude
that
the
standard
of
prejudice
that
applies
must
be
the
standard
--
the
same
standard
that
would've
applied
to
the
particular
(inaudible)
--
equitable
remedy
that's
imposed.
for
example,
detrimental
reliance
would've
been
and
it
would
be
required
for
relief
based
on
the
equitable
remedy
of
the
estoppel
as
it
used
to
be
in
the
court
of
equity.
but,
its
only
a
showing
of
actual
harm
would've
been
necessary
for
relief
based
on
the
equitable
remedy
of
surcharge
for
these
reasons
and
those
given
at
even
greater
length.
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
and
we
remand
for
further
proceeds.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
justice
sotomayor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
