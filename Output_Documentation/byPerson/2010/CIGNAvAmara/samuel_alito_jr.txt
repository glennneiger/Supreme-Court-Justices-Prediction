alito,

if
the
--
if
the
spd
is
part
of
the
plan,
then
where
does
the
"likely
harm"
standard
come
from?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
why
is
there
any
requirement
whatsoever,
other
than
the
fact
that
it's
in
the
plan?
if
the
spd
is
the
plan
and
the
spd
says
you
get
certain
benefits
that
you
wouldn't
get
under
the
written
document,
then
--
the
previously
executed
written
document,
then
you
get
the
benefits
under
the
spd,
period.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there's
likely
harm
or
reliance
or
anything
else,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
this:
if
this
were
an
individual
action
and
it
--
and
it
were
under
(a)(3),
what
would
either
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
have
to
show,
depending
on
what
the
burden,
who
has
the
burden,
on
the
issue
of
likely
harm?
what
would
"likely
harm"
mean
in
that
context?
the
person
was
likely
to
have
left
the
employment
of
the
company,
or
what?
what
else?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

if
an
administrator
--
if
an
administrator
issues
a
summary
plan
description
that
is
100
pages
long
and
is
basically
the
same
thing
as
the
written
instrument
and
that's
a
violation
of
the
requirement
in
erisa
that
it
be
a
summary
and
that
it
be
intelligible
to
ordinary
readers,
what
remedy
is
available
to
a
beneficiary?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
put
the
--
think
of
the
incentives
for
the
administrator
in
that
situation
or
for
the
plan
sponsor.
if
you
issue
a
succinct
spd,
you
risk
misleading
the
recipients
as
to
the
contents
of
the
plan
and
you
may
have
financial
liability.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
you
issue
--
you
are
on
the
side
of
issuing
an
spd
that
is
comprehensive,
well,
the
worst
that
can
happen,
according
to
what
you
just
said,
is
you
could
be
faced
with
an
injunction
to
provide
a
more
concise
and
comprehensible
statement.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
this
is
a
contract
case,
then
where
does
the
"likely
harm"
standard
come
from?
if
i'm
owed
something
under
a
contract,
i
am
entitled
to
get
that
under
the
contract.
i
don't
need
to
show
that
i
was
likely
harmed
by,
that
i
relied
in
any
--
in
any
way
on
anything.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
likely
harm
is
required?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there
was
a
notice,
wasn't
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
is
the
claim
based
on
that
or
is
it
based
on
the
spd?
