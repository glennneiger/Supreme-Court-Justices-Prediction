chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
09-804,
cigna
corporation
v.
amara.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
you
can't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--then
you
can't
require,
it
seems
to
me,
each
individual
to
make
a
calculation
about
whether
they
have
actually
been
harmed,
whether
there
is
detrimental
reliance.
the
whole
point
of
these
plans
is
to
give
some
people
some
comfort
and
assurance
when
they
are
age
whatever,
that:
don't
worry;
retirement
is
taken
care,
or
at
least
i
can
rely
on
that.
and
your
formulation
would
sort
of
put
that
up
in
the
air
and
say:
we
don't
know
if
you
are
going
to
be
harmed
or
not;
wait
until
you
are
65
and
we
will
see.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
bruce?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
very
tough
argument
to
say
--
to
make
a
nondisclosure
claim
on
the
theory
that
the
summary
is
part
of
the
plan,
because
the
whole
point
of
a
summary
is
not
to
disclose
everything.
if
it
disclosed
everything,
it
wouldn't
be
a
summary.
and
if
you
can
claim
something
because
it
didn't
disclose
it,
it
seems
to
me
that's
in
tension
with
the
idea
that
it's
not
supposed
to
be
just
a
repetition
of
the
plan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
just
stop
--
the
securities
cases,
does
that
involve
stock
traded
in
a
market,
in
which
case
the
inference
of
harm
would
be
much
more
obvious
and
follow
more
logically
than
in
the
trust
context?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
olson,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
