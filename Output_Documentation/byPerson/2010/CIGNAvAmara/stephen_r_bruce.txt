mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
detrimental
reliance
is
not
found
in
section
102
of
erisa,
which
establishes
the
summary
plan
description
requirements.
it's
not
found
in
section
404(a)(1)(d)
of
erisa,
which
establishes
the
fiduciary
duty
that's
in
accordance
with
the
plan
documents
and
instruments,
plural,
insofar
as
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
this
title.
it
is
also
not
consistent
with
any
language
in
section
502(a),
either
in
502(a)(1)(b)
or
502(a)(3).
the
reference
to
equitable
relief
is
to
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
redress
a
violation
of
title
i,
or
a
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
plan.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
the
--
the--
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
--under
either
(a)--
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
--under
--
our
understanding
is
that
under
either
(a)(1)(b)
or
(a)(3),
that
the
court
is
effectively
providing
an
injunction
in
a
case
like
this,
where
--
where
an
action
violates
the
statute.
and
here
a
plan
provision
which
had
a
very
detrimental
effect
on
people
was
not
disclosed
to
them,
and
so
the
effect
of
the
statute
is
to
make
that
unfavorable
provision
ineffective.
and
so--
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
--i
think,
as
we've
said
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
the
likely
harm,
possible
prejudice,
and
the
material
conflict
that
--
that
is
used
in
the
third
circuit
in
burstein,
we
think
that
all
of
those
standards
are
very
similar,
that
they
are
really
looking
at
whether--
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
--well,
i
think,
justice
alito,
we
see
this
more
as
a
nondisclosure
issue,
that
the
unfavorable
provisions
in
the
plan
were
not
disclosed,
and
that
the
effect
of
the
statute
is
to
make
those
unfavorable
plan
provisions
ineffective.
but
because
the
statute
refers
to,
for
example,
material
modifications
and
being
sufficiently
comprehensive
and
reasonably
apprising,
that
there
are
enough
qualifications
in
there
where
the
court
can
look
and
see,
is
this
really
--
was
this
conflict,
was
it
really
about
something
that
was
significant
to
people
that
might
have
an
impact
on
their
decisionmaking
and
whether
the
terms
of
their
employment
are
satisfactory,
whether
they
might
want
to
seek
another
job,
they
might
just
go
into
the
office
and
say:
we
need
more
benefits.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
our
position
is
that
the
spd
is
one
of
the
documents
or
instruments
governing
the
plan.
and
by
statute
it's
required
to
have
certain
--
to
meet
certain
requirements,
and
therefore
it
becomes
a
document
governing
the
plan.
it
is
--
in
response
to
mr.
olson,
it
is
referred
to
as
a
document
in
section
1024(a)(6)
of
the
statute,
and
of
course
this
court
has
repeatedly
referred
to
it
as
a
plan
document
and
to
"plan
documents"
plural.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
i
think
the
favorable/unfavorable
is
that
the
way
--
the
way
i
see
it
is
that
an
unfavorable
plan
term,
when
you
look
at
curtiss-wright,
an
unfavorable
plan
term
must
be
validly
adopted
and
it
must
be
disclosed
in
accordance
with
erisa
in
order
to
be
effective.
and
so
in
the
frommert
v.
conkright
case,
that
was
specifically
what
the
second
circuit
held,
was
that
the
summary
plan
description
did
not
disclose
the
phantom
offset
and
therefore
the
phantom
offset
was
ineffective.
here
the
summary
plan
description
did
not
disclose
the
wear-away
provisions.
people's
normal
expectation
is
that
if
they
are
under
a
pension
plan
and
they
are
continuing
to
work,
that
they
are
continuing
to
earn
pension
benefits.
so
that
the
spd
was
not
apprising
them
that
there
were
unfavorable
provisions
in
the
plan,
which
were
validly
adopted,
but
which
were
secret
as
far
as
they
were
concerned.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
the,
the
--
the
congress
in
erisa
is
concerned
with
unfavorable
effects
on
participants.
it's
about
protecting
employee
rights.
so
the
focus
is
on
losses
of
benefits
and
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
regulations
and
in
the
statute
about
disclosing
all
the
circumstances
that
can
result
in
a
loss
of
benefits.
so
there
was
a
plan
provision
here
which
caused
the
loss
of
benefits
that
was
never
disclosed
to
people.
and
it
was
--
there
was
no
baseline
where
people
knew,
well,
the
plan
document
may
have
a
wear-away
provision,
and
the
spd
doesn't
mention
it
and
therefore
there
is
no
wear-away.
they
didn't
know
what
wear-away
was.
they
don't
know
what
wear-away
is
today,
because
it
has
never
been
disclosed
to
them
that
there
is
a
way
to
rig
up
a
pension
plan
where
you
can
have
a
period
of
years,
unbeknownst
to
you,
where
you
are
not
earning
any
an
additional
benefits.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
now--
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
--no,
it
is
in
the
opinion.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
the
district
court
found
a
violation.
it's
1024(h)
--
204(h)
of
erisa,
that
that
provision
--
the
district
court
found
a
violation
of
that
provision,
which
if
the
court
had
provided
relief
would
have
resulted
in
the
class
receiving
much
more
relief
than
the
court
ultimately
ordered;
that
it
would
have
resulted
in
the
class
receiving
four
or
five
times
as
much
relief,
because
they
would
have
just
been
put
back
under
the
old
pension
formula.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
it
appears
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
because
after
the
district
court
found
a
violation
of
it
the
district
court
declined
to
provide
relief
because
there
had
been
an
intermediate
interim
amendment
that
might
have--
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
--that's
--
that's
--
that's
one
way
that
it
would
be
--
that's
the
way
it's
approached
under
the
securities
act,
where
there
is
an
expressed
reliance
requirement.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
well,
we
didn't
go
based
on
a
trust
law
case
involving
a
big
class,
but
we
based
it
on
bogert
and
on
section
173
in
the
restatement
of
trusts,
that
when
there
is
a
breach
of
the
duty
to
disclose
all
of
the
material
information
that
the
beneficiary
needs
to
know
in
interacting
with
a
third
party,
which
in
this
case
would
be
cigna
with
respect
to
their
employment,
that
then
there
is
no
requirement
of
proving
reliance;
that
the
trustee
can
prove
--
as
the
second
circuit
set
up,
that
the
trustee
can
try
and
prove
that
the
beneficiary
had
all
the
information
that
they
needed.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
for
a
breach
of
the
duties
to
the--
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
--my
understanding
is
--
i
mean,
that's
the
law
that's
been
--
that
this
court
has
adopted
in
securities
cases
where
we
have
nondisclosures
to
broad
classes,
is
that
there's
a
presumption
of
reliance,
which
--
because
it's
unrealistic
for
thousands
of
people
to
prove
reliance
in
--
in--
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
--well,
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
saying,
that
there's
a
commonality
between
the
securities
cases,
trust
law
as
stated
in
the
comment
to
section
173
and
in
bogert,
and
what
the
second
circuit
is
doing.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
well,
one
--
one
of
this
court's
very
first
erisa
cases
was
teamsters
v.
daniel,
in
which
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
had
considered
pension
plans
to
be
a
security.
and
--
and
the
case
actually
involved
break
in
service
rules,
and
this
court
concluded
that
whatever
protections
the
securities
laws
offered,
potentially
offered,
to
participants
were
now
offered
in
more
concrete
form
under
erisa.
but
the
--
the
point
that
i
want
to
get
back
to
on
reliance
is
that
my
reading
of
this
court's
decision
in
bridge
and
in
lyng
v.
payne
is
that
this
court
does
not
look
for
the
closest
analogy
to
a
statutory
provision.
the
question
is:
what
did
congress
do
in
enacting
this
statutory
provision?
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
"likely
harm"
can
include
that
the
--
that
if
the
person
knew
about
the
provision,
they
might
have
asked
for
the
provision
to
be
changed.
they
might
have
asked
for
a
different
compensation
package.
they
might
have
asked
--
they
might
have
taken
personal
kind
of
self-help
steps
to
protect
themselves
so
that
they
might
have
--
have,
you
know,
decided
to
have
their
wife
work
longer.
they
might
have
decided
to
work
longer
themselves.
they
could
have
saved,
saved
differently.
there's
both
the
steps
that
you
can
take
in
relation
to
your
employment
and
the
steps
that
you
can
take
on
a
personal
basis.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
the
district
court--
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
--well,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
a
real
prospect
of
employee
backlash
if
the
employees
knew
about
these
benefit
reductions.
it's
well-established
in
behavioral
economics
that
people
are
very
averse
to
losses.
so
if
--
if
the
statute
and
the
regulations
are
requiring
the
loss
to
be
disclosed,
it
isn't
going
out
on
a
limb
to
say
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
reaction
to
that.
and
here,
cigna
knew
that
there
was
a
reaction
to
that,
and
they
had
examples
from
the
press
in
which
deloitte
&
touche
had
had
a
similar
situation
where
they
had
to
roll
back
the
cash
balance
changes
because
employees
were
so
upset.
i
think,
in
response
to
justice
alito's
question,
the
--
i
don't
think
that
the
individual
has
to
--
that
if
the
individual
has
to
prove
possible
prejudice,
that
i
think
that,
as
--
as
our
district
court
ruled
here,
then
i
think
the
standard
inevitably
becomes
very
close
to
actual
prejudice.
so
i
think
that
the
possible
prejudice
is
really
to
the
employee
group.
it's
to
the
--
the
statute
is
in
terms
of
the
average
plan
participant.
it's
all
based
on
objective
standards.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
well,
as
we
said
in
the
brief,
there
are
already
cases
that
--
that
recognize
exceptions
to
liability
here,
and
one
of
them
is
for
prompt
correction
of
any
problem.
so
if
you
have
the
unintentional
error
in
that
unintentionally
the
wear-away
provisions
weren't
disclosed,
well,
then
the
issue
is:
why
wasn't
that
corrected
at
any
point
in
time?
we
are
now
12
years
out
and
cigna
has
never
disclosed
those
wear-aways
to
anyone.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
i
think
that
that's
--
obviously,
injunctive
relief
in
terms
of
an
order
to
correct
that
would
be
available.
i
think
in
terms
of
--
of
affecting
the
benefit
offers,
of
saying,
well,
is
a
--
if
the
spd
is
identical
to
the
plan
document,
is
there
any
--
there
are
no
undisclosed
plan
provisions,
then.
so
it
becomes
--
it
becomes
more
difficult
in
terms
of
relief,
but
obviously
there
would
be
relief
for
the
understandability
requirement.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
well,
intentional
errors
should
not
be
countenanced
and
here
cigna
was
deliberately
misleading
employees.
if
it's
an
unintentional
error,
then
it
should
be
promptly
corrected.
mr.
stephen
r.
bruce
thank
you.
