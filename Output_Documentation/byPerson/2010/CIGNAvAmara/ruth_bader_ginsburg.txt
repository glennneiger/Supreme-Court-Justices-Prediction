mr.
olson,
when
you
say
the
employees
had
no
choice,
but
the
district
court
found,
didn't
it,
that
the
reason
for
this
plan
summary
being
misleading
was
that
the
employer,
cigna,
feared
that
there
might
be
a
backlash
on
the
part
of
the
employees
if
they
found
out,
if
they
were
told
the
truth
about
this
plan;
that
is,
that
it
was
less
favorable,
that
they
would
not
have
the
same
benefits
that
they
had
under
the
prior
plan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
what
the
district
court
said
was
that
they
would
treat
the
plan
as
containing
what
the
summary
said,
not
that
--
that
it
was
part
of
the
plan
itself,
not
an
amendment,
amendment.
i
thought
that
was
what
the
district
court
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
can't
do
that
because
the
statute
requires
a
summary
to
be
understandable
and
not
prolix.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wasn't
the
--
wasn't
the
meaning
of
"likely
harm"
simply
that
they
were
promised
one
thing
in
the
plan
documents,
and
so
what
likely
harm
is,
is
we
have
to
do
away
with
what
they
call,
what
is
it,
the
wear-away
effect?
so
that's
the
harm,
the
wear-away
effect,
and
we
have
to
remedy
that.
and
the
way
to
remedy
it
is
to
treat
this
as,
what
is
it,
instead
of
(a)
or
(b),
(a)
plus
(b).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
couldn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it
couldn't
be
brought
as
a
class
action,
and
isn't
that
a
large
piece
of
this
picture,
that
proceeding
as
they
did
they
can
proceed
as
a
class?
proceeding
under
detrimental
reliance,
it
would
be
hard
to
get
a
class
because
it
would
be
an
individual
case
of
detrimental
reliance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
the
question
is,
under
the
--
under
the
section
that
the
district
court
proceeded
under,
not
the
one
that
you
say
is
proper,
a
class
action
would
be
appropriate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
it
--
i
think
the
brief
--
the
petitioner's
brief
pointed
out,
it
governs
the
plan
only
when
it's
more
favorable
to
the
participants,
because
you
wouldn't
say,
if
the
plan
were
more
favorable
and
the
summary
would
show
fewer
benefits,
that
the
summary
would
then
govern.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
the
rule
come
from,
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
put
--
do
you
put
any
weight
on
congress
insisting
that
the
summary
that
each
--
each
participant
get
a
copy
of
that
summary,
but
there
is
no
such
requirement
with
respect
to
the
plan?
