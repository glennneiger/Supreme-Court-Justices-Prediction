justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me,
chief
justice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
turning
to
(a)(3),
i
have
two
questions.
one
is,
as
you
--
and
this
is
probably
for
your
friends
on
the
other
side
more
than
you.
but
as
you
understand
the
"likely
harm"
standard
that
prevails
in
the
second
circuit,
is
this
likely
harm
to
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
class,
all
the
members
of
the
class?
do
you
know?
has
the
second
circuit
told
us
what
that
means?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
--
or
a
significant
number?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question
had
no
import.
i
really
wanted
to
know
the
answer.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
white
light
--
just
one
more
thing.
if
you
proceed
under
(a)(3),
doesn't
mertens
bar
the
award
of
--
of
monetary
damages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
--
then
you
are
not
offering
us
much.
you
say:
oh,
please
go
under
(a)(3),
but
then
you
go
back
and
say:
oh,
well,
you
can't
get
monetary
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
seems
to
me
like
just
a
roundabout,
complex
way
of
saying
that
you
must
recover
under
the
plan,
because
if
reliance
is
not
required
then
there
must
be
some
basis
on
which
you
must
recover,
and
that
recovery
must
be
under
the
plan.
so
it's
--
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
you
say
injury
is
not
required,
then
--
then
i
don't
see
how
the
spd
can
give
you
recovery,
unless
the
spd
is
the
plan,
which
brings
us
right
back
to
the
argument,
which
is
your
argument,
under
the
first
--
under
the
first
section,
under
(a).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--(a)(1),
(a)(1).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there's
a
presumption
that
everything
in
the
plan
is
favorable?
i
still
don't
see
how
you
get
it
both
ways.
if
it
understates
the
benefits,
that
doesn't
count?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
say
under
standard
trust
law
once
you
show
there's
a
breach,
the
burden
shifts
to
the
trustee
to
show
that
there's
no
harm?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that
to
be
the
second
circuit
rule,
but
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
the
rule
generally
in
the
law
of
trusts
and
i
quarrel
with
the
government's
brief
on
that.
i
think
the
government's
brief
is
quite
wrong
to
suggest
that
this
is
part
of
the
law
of
trusts.
now,
it
could
be
the
law
of
erisa
under
the
second
circuit,
but
that's
something
quite
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
under
trust
--
trust
law,
or
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
proposal
i
assume,
if
you
prevail,
under
your
position,
the
summaries
will
now
become
part
of
the
plan.
so
that
even
if
there's
no
intent
to
mislead,
there
can
be
a
class
action
if
the
--
if
the
spd
is
in
--
anyhow
at
variance
with
the
plan
and
to
the
detriment
of
the
employee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
minute
you
get
away
from
contract--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
if
it's
a
contract
case
that
you
are
submitting
then
the
burden
shifting
rules
it
seems
to
me
that
apply
in
trust
don't
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
in
all
of
that,
i
think
under
trust
law
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
breach
and
harm
before
there
is
--
the
burden
shifts
on
causation.
and
your
brief
left
out
the
--
you
indicate
the
burden
shifts
just
so
long
as
you
show
that
there
is
a
misstatement.
