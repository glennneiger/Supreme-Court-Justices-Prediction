mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
crafted
a
carefully
balanced
erisa
enforcement
scheme
that
enables
plan
participants
to
recover
plan
benefits
under
section
502(a)(1)(b),
and
equitable
remedies
for
erisa
violations
under
section
502(a)(3).
in
this
case,
respondents
are
seeking
a
remedy
for
misleading
plan
summaries
that
violated
erisa.
their
remedy,
if
they
were
harmed
by
defective
plan
summaries,
is
under
502(a)(3),
equitable
remedies,
not
for
plan
benefits
under
502(a)(1)(b).
the
section
that
governs
the
relief
that
is
sought
is
a
necessary
antecedent
to
any
of
the
other
questions
in
this
case,
and
erisa
carefully
structures,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
the
court
is
not
interested
and
does
not
--
is
not
willing
to
alter
the
structure
that
congress
carefully
crafted
and
carefully
developed
over
the
years
to
provide
remedies
with
respect
to
erisa
programs.
and
the
scheme
is
such
that,
if
there
is
a
participant
to
the
plan
who
is
seeking
benefits
under
that
plan,
section
(a)(1)(b)
of
--
subsections
(a)(1)(b)
of
section
502
provides
for
relief
under
the
plan.
if
there
are
other
violations
of
erisa,
section
502(a)(3)
provides
for
equitable
relief.
that
is
the
scheme
carefully
developed
by
congress.
now,
in
this
case
what
happened
is
that
cigna
changed
its
pension
program,
its
erisa
plan,
from
a
defined
benefit
plan
to
a
cash
benefit
plan,
cash
value
plan.
and
it
put
out,
as
required
by
erisa,
summaries
of
the
new
plan
that
the
district
court
found,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
were
misleading
in
the
sense
that
they
did
not
provide
all
of
the
information
necessary
for
plan
participants
to
evaluate
what
was
happening.
now,
the
changes
to
the
plan
were
lawful.
erisa
permitted
and
does
permit
these
kind
of
changes
to
an
erisa
plan.
there
was
nothing
unlawful
about
the
plan
and
the
plan
change.
and
the
beneficiaries,
the
participants
to
the
plan,
did
not
have
any
choice.
cigna
had
the
right
to
change
the
plan.
it
did
change
the
plan.
it
did
have
an
obligation
under
erisa
to
provide
accurate
summaries,
and
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
those
summaries
were
not
inaccurate.
in
other
words
--
they
were
not
accurate.
in
other
words--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
they
had
no
choice
in
the
sense
that
cigna
could
adopt
a
change
in
the
plan,
as
it
did.
that
was
permitted
under
erisa,
but
it
was
required
to
give
accurate
summaries.
the
choice
that
you
are
suggesting
and
the
district
court
was
concerned
about
is
that
an
individual
could
have
left
the
employ
of
cigna
if
he
or
she
was
unhappy
with
the
change
in
the
plan,
or
the
district
court
said
there
could
have
been
some
sort
of
a
protest.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
remedy
--
what
was
--
what
was
the
violation
is
the
summary
itself.
we're
not
--
we're
not
challenging
that
here.
that's
a
finding
below.
the
summary
was
misleading,
but
that
makes
it
a
violation
of
erisa.
the
summary
is
not
the
plan.
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
quite
clear
from
the
structure
of
the
statute
that
is
correct,
as
you
suggest,
that
there
may
be
multiple
instruments
or
documents
that
are
the
--
create
the
plan
itself.
but
the
summary
plan
document,
the
spd,
is
not
a
part
of
the
plan.
it
is
a
separate
document.
it
is
a
summary.
it
is
a
succinct
statement
of
what
might
be
in
the
plan,
and
it
must
be
accurate
and
it
must
be
written
in
comprehensible
english.
but
i
would
refer
the
court
to
section
1024
(b)(2)
and
(4),
which
are
on
pages
3a,
4a,
and
5a
of
the
blue
brief.
that
describes
the
obligations
that
are
required
with
respect
to
the
summary
plan
document.
and
it
describes
the
instruments
of
both
the
summary
plan
document
and
the
instruments
that
constitute
the
plan
itself
in
the
following
sentence
--
and
this
is
a
similar
sentence
in
subsection
(4),
but
i'm
reading
from
subsection
(2),
which
is
on
4a
of
the
blue
brief.
it
says:
"summary
plan"
--
it
refers
to
"a
summary
plan
description
and
the
latest
annual
report
and/or
--
and
the
bargaining
agreement,
trust
agreement,
contract
or
other
instruments
under
which
the
plan
was
established.
"
the
construction
of
that
sentence
has
to
be
that
the
summary
plan
description
is
a
separate
document.
it
is
not
one
of
those
latter
category
of
documents
under
which
the
plan
was
established.
and
the
proof
of
that,
if
english
doesn't
teach
it
to
us,
which
i
think
it
does,
is
the
reference
to
the
annual
report.
no
one
would
say
and
no
one
would
contend
that
the
annual
report
is
a
part
of
the
instruments
creating
the
plan.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
written
instruments,
as
these
things
turn
out,
are
long,
complex
documents.
they
may
be
90,
100
pages
long.
the
summary,
as
you
suggest,
congress
said,
yes,
there
is
a
separate
document
that
must
state
in
intelligible
english
that
plan
participants
can
understand
the
following
things,
and
they
must
be
furnished
to
plan
participants,
but
they
are
not
the
plan
document.
the
way
that
erisa
is
structured--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well
--
if
the
--
if
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
plan
can
be
more
detailed
than
the
spd.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
if
the
plan
is
--
if
the
spd
complies
with
erisa,
yes.
it
has
to
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
exactly.
but
not
everything
that
is
in
the
plan,
or
the
plan
--
as
the
statute
says,
the
documents
that
constitute
the
plan
need
not
necessarily
be
in
the
summary.
the
words
"summary
plan"--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
submit
that
that
is
not
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
and
subsections
(2)
and
(4)
of
the
provision
that
i
was
referring
to
make
that
clear
if
the
word
"summary"
itself
did
not
make
that
clear.
but
the
curtiss-wright
case
to
which
you
referred
to
in
your
earlier
question
also
proves
that.
curtiss-wright
case
talked
about
a
summary
plan
description
and
said
it
can't
modify
the
plan
--
using
"plan",
"summary
plan
description",
in
different
terms
--
it
cannot
modify
the
plan,
which
is
what
the
district
court
here
held,
unless
the
plan
specifically
says
that
it
may
be
modified
in
a
certain
way
and
that
the
summary
is
an
appropriate
amendment
to
the
plan.
so
the
court
--
and
this
was
a
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
--
was
referring
to
the
summary
as
something
that
was
separate,
that
might
modify
the
plan
if
the
plan
itself
allows
for
it
to
be
modified
in
that
fashion.
now,
the
government
says
that
the
summary
plan
description
is
a
part
of
the
plan
and
so
do
respondents.
and
that's
what
the
court
below
--
the
court
below
didn't
actually
find
that
the
spd
was
a
part
of
the
plan.
the
court
found,
on
the
latter
pages
of
its
opinion,
that
it
was
a
modification,
it
was
an
amendment
to
the
plan.
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
curtiss-wright
case
because
in
this
case
the
plan
itself
specifically
says
that
it
cannot
--
does
not
say
that
it
can
be
amended
by
the
spd.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
in
the
--
on
the
page
of
the
--
this
is
the
summary
to
the
cert
petition,
page
218,
which
is
the
district
court's
--
the
conclusions
of
the
district
court's
decision.
under
roman
numeral
viii,
the
district
court
specifically
said
that
"the
terms
of
part
b
have
been
correspondingly
modified
by
the
spds.
"
the
court
was
saying
--
i
think
you
were
referring,
justice
ginsburg,
to
the
relief
that
the
court
ordered,
but
the
court
was
ordering
that
relief
on
the
theory
that
the
spds
modified
the
plan.
and
the
plan
itself
under
curtiss-wright
doesn't
provide
for
it
to
be
amended
in
that
way.
and
the
spds--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
and
the
spds,
the
two
spds
themselves
on
page
922a
and
938a
of
the
joint
appendix,
specifically
say
that
if
there
is
any
discrepancy
between
the
spd
and
the
plan
the
plan
governs.
the
language
is
at
the
bottom
of,
for
example,
at
the
bottom
of
922a.
so--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
correct.
no
one
--
but
congress
did
consider
prohibiting
a
provision
like
that
in
spds,
that
they
could
not
disclaim,
they
could
not
say
that
if
there
is
any
inconsistency
the
plan
governed,
and
congress
did
not
adopt
such
a
provision.
this
is
a
perfectly
legal
provision,
to
tell
someone
that
if
there
is
any
discrepancy
--
and
there
is
bound
to
be
discrepancies.
as
i
said,
the
plans
themselves
can
be
90,
100
pages,
very
long
and
very
complex.
that's
why
there
is
an
spd
that
can't
contain
everything
in
the
plan.
and
one
of
the
thing
that
would
be
the
outcome
of
what
the
government
and
respondents
are
urging
here
is
that
plan
creators,
these
companies
that
create
these
plans,
either
will
be
discouraged
from
doing
it
or
they
will
start
preparing
summaries
that
are
90
and
100
pages
long.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
catch
22,
because
if
there
is
a
discrepancy
because
they
have
to
be
short,
summary,
and
intelligible,
then
we
are
have
--
we're
faced
with
the
proposition
that
someone's
going
to
say,
well,
i
read
the
spd
and
it
didn't
say
what
was
in
the
plan.
if
the
spd
is
as
long
and
as
detailed
as
the
plan,
then
there
is
a
violation
of
erisa.
my
point
i
guess
in
this
is
that,
yes,
justice
kagan,
the
statute
requires
the
spd
to
contain
certain
information.
we
accept
the
fact
of
the
conclusions
of
the
court
below
in
this
case
that
they
did
not
do
so.
there
are
two
spds.
they
failed
to
live
up
to
the
requirements
of
erisa.
there
is
a
remedy
for
that.
it
is
a
violation
of
erisa
and
it
specifically
says
in
502(a)(3)
that
for
violations
of
erisa,
equitable
remedies
are
available.
and
that
is
what
congress
decided.
unless
it's
a
part
of
the
plan,
you
must
go
under
(a)(3).
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
would
submit
that
it
can't
modify
the
plan
unless
the
plan
permits
that.
that's
curtiss-wright.
that's
the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
seems
to
me
--
i
think
we
might
disagree
about
that,
respectfully.
i
think
that
the
sense
of
the
opinion
in
curtiss-wright
was
that
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
this
spd
modifies
the
plan,
it
can
only
do
so
if
the
plan
permits
the
spd
to
modify
the
plan.
then
the
court
sent
it
back
to
a
lower
court
to
determine
whether
in
fact
the
employees
that
were
involved
in
creating
the
spd
there
had
the
authority
under
the
plan
to
modify
the
plan.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
in
the
first
place,
it
is
important
which
section.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
so
because
it's
a
different
defendant.
the
plan
is
the
defendant,
versus
the
plan
administrator
is
the
defendant,
so
that's
important.
secondly,
(a)(3)
provides
only
for
remedies
that
are
available
in
equity.
then
the
point
that
you
are
making
with
respect
to
what
provision
of
equity,
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
action
that's
brought
and
what
is
the
remedy
sought,
as
this
court
talked
about
in
the
varity
case,
and
so
therefore
those
are
those
questions.
now,
the
second
circuit
said
"likely
harmed".
the
fact
is,
as
i
pointed
out
at
the
very
beginning,
this
was
a
lawful
change
in
a
plan
and
it's
a
plan
where
27,000
people
that
were
employees
were
participants
in
this
plan
and
they
would
have
had
to
do,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
either
leave
the
company
and
suffer
some
harm
or
engage
in
some--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--absolutely
we
are
not.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
six
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
detrimental
reliance
is
required.
if
this
is
an
action
under
(a)(3)
under
equity,
neither
the
government
nor
the
respondents
dispute
the
fact
that
detrimental
reliance
would
be
required
if
you
are
proceeding
in
equity
under
(a)(3).
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
"likely
harm"
is
not
a
demonstration
of
prejudicial
reliance.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
in
the
first
place,
it
comes
out
of
the
blue,
"likely
harm",
as
i
suggested,
since
this
was
a
legal
lawful
change.
people
were
going
to
retain
their
employment.
they
didn't
have
a
right
to
opt
for
one
or
the
other.
if
they
could
prove
that
they
were--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
would
not
be
justified
at
all.
i
mean,
under
equity,
as
this
court
said
in
the
lyng
v.
payne
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
this
is
like
an
estoppel
action.
an
essential
element
of
an
estoppel
action
is
detrimental
reliance
on
the
adverse
party's
misrepresentation.
what
the
district
court
below
did
was
by
coming
up
with
this
27,000
members
of
this
purported
class
somehow
were
hurt
by
a
change
in
a
plan
over
which
they
had
no
control,
over
which
they
had
no
discretion,
unless
they
were
going
to
leave
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
that
would
be
an
action
to
seek
benefits
under
the
plan,
which
would
be
an
(a)(1)(b)
action
against
the
plan
itself.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
against
the
plan.
the
record
suggests
in
various
parts
--
i
can't
remember
which
page
to
refer
to
--
that
$70
million
would
be
the
consequence
of
this
against
the
plan,
on
which
some
people,
depending
upon
how
long
they
were
with
the
company,
when
they
left
the
company,
whether
they
were
about
to
retire,
whether
they
stayed
longer
and
the
interest
rates
fluctuated,
there
can
be
all,
innumerable
permutations
of
the
effect
upon
persons.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
chief
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
the
statute.
the
statute
gives
you
a
relief
with
respect
to
a
misleading
plan
summary
under
the
laws
of
equity.
the
laws
of
equity
would
require
that
the
person
say
--
demonstrate
in
some
way
that
they
were
harmed.
the
petition
--
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
named
members
of
the
class,
claim
that
they
were
out
some
30-some
thousand
dollars
each.
they
would
have
an
incentive
to
bring
an
action
by
themselves.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
under
the
rules--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
rules
enabling
act
provides
that
a
class
mechanism
cannot
change
the
substantive
provisions
of
law.
and
so,
it
cannot
be
that
because
this
is
brought
as
a
class
action
the
rules
of
equity
somehow
change.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
a
class
action
might
be
appropriate
but
it
would
not
change
the
detrimental
reliance
requirement.
again--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
second
circuit
suggested,
and
the
government
and
respondents,
particularly
the
respondents,
say
if
there's
a
material
difference
likely
harm
is
presumed.
and
the
government
itself
says--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
is
the
question.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
--
i
totally
agree
with
the
import
of
those
questions.
you
can't
describe
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
answer
--
the
answer
is
what
the
district
court
ordered
and
the
government
seeks
and
the
respondents
seek,
is
they
are
all
harmed
by
this,
that
there
is
any
material
disparity,
then
everybody--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
defies
reality--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--justice
breyer,
to
suggest
that
the
27,000
people
--
each
one
occupy
a
different
position
in
terms
of
the
length
of
their
employment,
when
they
might
be
retiring,
what
their
benefits
might
be,
whether
they
might
take
a
lump
sum
or
an
annuity.
all
of
those
thing
are
different.
and
the
only
way
they--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
only
way
they
could
have
been
harmed,
justice
breyer,
is
if
they
had
otherwise
decided
to
leave
the
employ
of
the
company
and
go
someplace
else.
they
could
demonstrate
that.
if
i
could
save
my
time--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
it
would.
i
mean,
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in
the
first
place,
that's
congress's
choice.
it's
an
equitable
remedy
that
would
be
required.
congress
made
that
decision.
this
court
has
said
it
is
not
going
to
reconstruct
what
congress
carefully
did.
the
thing
is
that
it
would
have
to
balance
people
wanting
to
create
these
plans
and
go
into
these
plans
and
the
solvency
and
stability
of
the
plan;
what
justice
breyer
is
suggesting,
and
the
second
circuit
suggested,
is
that
you
would
expose
plans
to
enormous
liability
because
someone
might
think
that
someone
might
have
left
the
employ
of
the
--
of
the
company
and
taken
a
different
job.
that's
not
realistic.
and
--
and
that's
why
it
just
came
out
of
--
out
of
thin
air.
if
i
may--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
refer
first
of
all
to
what
respondents
said
in
response
to
a
question
from
you,
justice
breyer,
about
section
204(g).
and
you--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
(g),
i'm
talking
about
that's
what
they
--
i
refer
you
to
page
212
of
the
cert
petition
appendix
under
roman
numeral
vi
where
the
district
court
specifically
said:
plaintiffs
also
seek
to
assert
their
claim
under
erisa's
anti-cutback
provision
204(g),
that
claim
has
been
rejected
in
the
liability
decision.
that
claim
was
raised;
it
was
rejected
in
the
liability
decision.
it's
not
here
anymore.
section
--
the
real
section
that
the
court
should
refer
to
in
204,
is
204
--
8
--
(h)(6)(a)
of
erisa;
and
i
can't
point
to
the
portion
of
the
appendix,
but
that
was
an
addition
by
congress
in
2001
to
a
--
deal
with
egregiously
inaccurate
notices
of
changes.
that
--
and
congress
amended
erisa
in
2001,
added
that
provision,
and
said,
if
there's
an
egregious
violation
of
that
provision,
then
you
get
all
the
benefits
that
you
should
have
gotten.
that's
what
congress
can
do
if
it
wishes
to
do.
that's
what
is
being
sought
in
this
case.
congress
can
take
care
of
this
if
it
wishes,
but
congress
enacted
a
carefully
reticulated
scheme;
you
are
either
suing
for
benefits
under
the
plan
or
you
are
suing
for
violations
of
erisa.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
--
the
notice
that
was
involved
was
referring
to
the
spd.
the
spd
to
the
extent
that
it
violates
erisa,
there
is
a
remedy
that
still
exists,
congress
hasn't
changed.
it's
in
(a)(3).
it
must
be
an
equitable
remedy.
you
can
seek
an
injunction.
and
to
the
extent
the
court
is
concerned
that
that's
an
empty
remedy,
that
that's
not
a
sufficient
remedy,
that's
what
congress
decided;
and
we
referred
in
footnote
3
of
our
reply
brief
of
a
number
of
cases
that
--
that
circuit
courts
have
handled
demonstrating
detrimental
reliance
and
providing
for
remedies.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
provision
applies
to
the
spd
and
they
did
not
bring
that
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
it's
a
different
type
of
notice.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
was
a
notice.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
claim
is
based
upon
the
spd
and
the
district
court
decided
that
the
spd
had
amended
the
plan
and
that's
inconsistent
with
what
the
statute
provides.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
and
trust
law--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
--
i
refer
to
what
justice
kennedy
was
referring
to.
to
the
extent
we
are
talking
about
trust
law,
we
are
talking
about
the
requirement
of
a
loss.
i
would
say
that
a
person
would
not
necessarily
have
to
have
read
the
spd,
but
to
have
been
aware
of
it
and
taken
some
steps
in
connection
with
it.
and
that's
the
evidence
that
would
have
to
be
established,
and
every
court
has
said
that
under
(a)(3)
equity
requires
detrimental
reliance.
