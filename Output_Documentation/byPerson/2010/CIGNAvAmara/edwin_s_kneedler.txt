mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
pension
benefits
an
employee
accrues
while
she
works
are
a
major
component
of
her
compensation
for
working,
just
as
her
wages
are.
the
employee
is
entitled
to
receive
those
benefits
and
to
recover
them
if
they
are
withheld
without
any
particularized
showing
of
detrimental
reliance,
just
as
she
is
entitled
to
recover
the
wages
that
were
promised
to
her.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
view
it
as
basically
a
contract
case.
in
firestone,
the
court
referred
to
contractually
--
contractually
guaranteed
benefits,
those
under
the
plan.
and
the
reason
we
think
that
here,
in
this
case
the
district
court
found
that
the
spd
basically
promised,
represented
to
employees,
that
after
the
conversion
they
would
receive
pension
benefits
in
the
form
of
a
plus
b,
the
old
benefits
plus
the
new
benefits,
accruing
right
away.
erisa
--
the
scheme
of
erisa
is
that
the
spd
is
often
and
typically
the
only
document
that
the
employee
receives
to
inform
him
or
her
about
the
contents
of
the
plan.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
we
do
not
think
detrimental
reliance
--
and
i
think
it
works
out--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
this
sense:
if
the
--
if
the
spd
contains
these
sorts
of
representations
such
that
the
employee
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
rely
upon
them
in
defining
her
benefits,
then
that
controls.
the
likely
harm
is
not
being
told,
or
being
told
something
different
from
what
the
underlying
plan
says.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--unless
the
participant
actually
knew
or
couldn't
reasonably
depend
upon
it.
actually
knew
--
for
example,
this
was
the
case
in
the
govoni
case
in
the
first
circuit,
that
--
whose
formulation
is
the
one
that
other
courts
typically
follow.
that
was
the
situation
where
the
employee
found
out
before
she
retired
what
the
true
facts
were
and
therefore
there
could
have
been
no
claim
of
harm
or
--
or
that
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
is
contract,
because
--
because
in
that
--
it
--
it's
--
the
question
is
what
is
the
contract.
to
the
employee,
typically
the
spd
is
the
only
thing
that
is
the
contract.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
underlying
formal
document
is
--
is
what
controls,
unless
the
sp
--
unless
there
is
a
conflict.
this
case--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
forms
--
it
forms
part
of
the
contract.
and
cases
of
conflicts
between
the
spd
and
the
--
and
the
formal
plan
document
are
not
common
and
they
shouldn't
be,
because
the
spd
--
the
administrator
or
the
employer
has
an
obligation
to
make--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
to
the
first
point,
it
is
--
it
is
common
and
it
was
critically
true
here
that
the
--
that
the
employer,
the
plan
sponsor,
is
involved
in
--
in
drafting
the
spd.
this
was
an
spd
that
was
issued
in
conjunction
with
the
plan
amendment,
and
the
spd
and
the
plan
amendment--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--okay.
and
--
and
so
the
--
the
second
point
is,
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
useful
for
the
court
to
look
to
the
experience
of
certificates
of
insurance
under
group
insurance
plans.
that
is
the
most
directly
analogous
circumstance
in
our
view.
it
is
the
prevailing
position
in
the
courts
and
it
has
been
for
sometime
that
where
an
employee
--
or
employee
under
a
group
plan
or
pension
plan
receives
a
certificate
of
insurance
that
sets
forth
certain
elements,
essential
elements
of
the
plan,
and
the
--
an
underlying
insurance
policy
is
in
conflict
with
that,
that
the
certificate
of
insurance
governs,
for
the
same
reason
that
the
spd
governs--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--some
of
them
may
be
and
some
of
them
may
not
be.
i
mean--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
--
the
rule
is
a
common
insurance
rule
that
in
--
in
the
group
insurance
situation,
where
you
have
an
underlying
policy
that
the
individual
insured
is
not
going
to
see.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
it's
also
a
statute
that
as
this
court
said
in
curtiss-wright
that
the
spd
is
designed
to
--
to
furnish
the
employee
the
essential
information
under
the
plan.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
what
it's
supposed
to
be.
and
importantly
in
that?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
not
in
the
record
in
this
case,
but
--
but
we
cite
some
insurance
treatises.
and
a
further
point
i
want
to
make--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
the
likely
harm
standard
was
a
formulation
of
the
--
of
the
second
circuit.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
--
i
think
it
was
--
it
was
--
it
was
an
effort
to
judge
whether
the
--
whether
the
particular
statements
in
the
spd
were
of
the
sort
that
--
i
think
it
really
gets
at
materiality.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it
would
be
--
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
thing
where
you
--
where
you
have
a
--
either
in
this
case
an
affirmative
representation
of
what
the
--
of
what
benefits
will
be
due,
or
you
could
have
a
situation
where
there
was
a
--
a
failure
to
disclose.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
burden
shifting
rule
would
apply
to
the
extent
that
enabling
the
administrator
of
the
plan
or
the
employer
to
demonstrate
that
the
employee
actually
knew
or
that
there
were
other
documents
that
would
have
informed
the
employee
so
that
he
would
not
have
been
mislead
by
the
statements
in
the
--
in
the
spd.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
is
harm,
because
the
employee
was
not
told
of
what
the
--
of
what
the
terms
of
his
--
of
his
deal
were.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
goes
to
work
every
day
expecting
to
earn
his
wages
and
expecting
to
earn
the
--
the
benefits
set
forth
in
the
spd.
and
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
--
that
is
critical
to
our
position,
and
again,
the
insurance/certificate
of
insurance
analogy,
it
is
all
the
same
reasons
that
we
say
under
erisa;
that
that's
the
only
document
that
is
given,
it's
given
for
the
obvious
purpose
of
--
of
telling
the
employee
the
essential
aspects
of
the
deal
that
he's
going
to
get,
and
erisa
identifies,
itemizes
what
they
are
and
requires
that
the
plan
administrator
not
--
not
minimize
what
they
are.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
not
an
amendment
to
the
plan.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
spd
--
the
spd
is
part
of
the
plan,
and
it
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
--
it
--
it
controls.
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that
--
that's
the
explanation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
does
not.
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
you
have
two
different
documents
that
may
be
part
of
the
contract.
it's
an
effort
to
find
out
what
the
deal
is.
under
the
insurance
cases
that
i
mentioned,
what
the
courts
says
--
what
the
courts
say
is
the
certificate
becomes
part
of
the
contract;
but
those
cases
also
say
when
the
--
when
the
plan
is
more
favorable,
that
the
plan
governs
because
that
--
under
erisa,
that
is
the
operative
plan
document
that
the
administrator
is
supposed
to
operate
under
day
to
day.
