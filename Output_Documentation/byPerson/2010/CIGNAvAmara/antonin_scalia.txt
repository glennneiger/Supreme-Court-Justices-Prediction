justice
antonin
scalia
am
i
missing
something?
they
--
they
cannot
be
in
the
spd
unless
they
are
in
the
plan;
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
one
cannot
be
more
detailed
than
the
other,
can
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever
is
in
the
spd
must
be
in
the
plan;
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can't
be
part
of
the
plan
without
modifying
the
plan,
can
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
it
contradicts
other
provisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
likely
harm
to
whom?
i
think
that's
the
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
justice
kennedy
is
asking,
and
i
have
the
same
question.
does
it
mean
likely
--
is
it
likely
that
the
class
as
a
whole
has
been
harmed,
or
that
each
--
is
it
likely
that
each
individual
member
of
the
class
has
been
harmed?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
a
majority?
or
whatever?
what
does
likely
harm
mean?
do
we
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
that
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
appear
anywhere
in
the
briefs?
1024(h),
does
it
appear
anywhere
in
the
briefs?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
likely
harm
--
that's
not
the
likely
harm.
that's
the
breach.
that's
the
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
once
you
make
the
offense,
you
have
to
cough
up
what
you
stated
in
the
--
in
the
summary.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
it's
not
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
contract
or
not
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
governed
by
erisa
or
are
these
things
governed
by
erisa?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
have
a
statute
here
which
says
that
it
is
the
plan
that
governs.
i
mean,
that
--
that's
--
don't
you
think
that's
a
crucial
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
use
a
likely
harm
standard?
is
that
where
the
likely
harm
standard
comes
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
nice.
where
did
they
get
it
from?
[laughter]
they
just
made
it
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
can't
--
can't
amend
the
plan
contrary
to
what
we
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
an
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait
--
wait.
it's
part
of
the
plan.
but
the
other
part
of
the
plan
contradicts
this
part
of
it.
and
--
and
you
say
it
is
this
part,
the
spd,
that
governs;
which
means
it
amends
the
prior
part,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
all
right,
okay.
we
will
say
it
controls.
does
that
make
you
feel
better
about
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
that
(h)
apply
here?
was
it
not
egregious
enough?
is
that
--
is
that
why
it
didn't
apply?
or
they
just
forgot
about
it
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
it
apply
to
the
spd,
isn't
that
a
notice?
