justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
olson,
we
have
several
times
referred
to
the
plan
as
having
a
range
of
documents
associated
with
it,
not
as
having
just
a
single
written
instrument,
but
we
referred
to
documents
and
instruments
governing
the
plan.
we
did
that
in
curtiss-wright,
which
is
the
case
that
you
pin
so
much
on.
we
did
that
in
kennedy.
and
the
statute
itself
talks
about
that
on
numerous
occasions,
that
there
are
documents
and
instruments,
in
the
plural,
and
one
would
think
that
the
spd
is
--
is
one
of
those
documents
and
instruments
that
govern
the
plan.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
was
struck
by
something
else,
mr.
olson.
i
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
statute
saying
what
is
in
the
summary
plan
description
is
packed
with
information
that
needs
to
be
in
the
summary
plan
description.
by
contrast,
the
written
instrument,
which
you
equate
to
the
plan,
the
written
instrument
says
barely
anything
about
what
has
to
be
in
it.
it
just
says
the
name
of
the
fiduciaries
has
to
be
in
the
written
instrument.
so
it
seems
clear
that
this
statute
is
set
up
so
that
everything
that
is
important,
everything
that
the
employee
needs
to
know
and
needs
to
rely
upon,
is
supposed
to
be
in
the
spd,
not
necessarily
in
the
written
instrument.
justice
elena
kagan
but
can't
the
spd--
justice
elena
kagan
--but,
mr.
olson,
what
about
the
opposite?
because
the
statute
seems
to
be
written
so
that
things
are
in
the
spd
which
don't
need
to
be
in
the
written
instrument.
and
together,
they
all
somehow
constitute
the
plan.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
spd
can't
negate
the
force
of
erisa,
and
if
erisa
says
that
the
summary
has
to
be
consistent
with
the
plan
documents
nothing
in
the
spd
can
negate
that
requirement.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
very
question
here
is
if
there
is
an
spd
that
is
inconsistent
in
some
way
with
the
written
instrument,
what
happens?
is
the
written
instrument
modified
or
instead
is
the
provision
in
the
spd
given
operative
effect?
and
that
question
is
one
about
your
benefits
under
the
plan.
justice
elena
kagan
i
do
think
you
are
over-reading
curtiss-wright.
curtiss
--
wright
talked
about
whether
a
particular
provision
satisfied
the
requirement
that
a
plan
have
an
amendment
provision.
it
didn't
say
anything
at
all
about
whether
there
are
provisions
that
can
have
operative
effect
regardless
of
whether
they
pass
through
a
formal
amendment
procedure.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
view
this
as
essentially
a
contract
case,
as
that
just
suggested,
or
instead
a
trust
case?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
kneedler,
i
think
it's
a
hard
question
here
as
to
whether
to
think
of
this
as
more
like
a
contract
dispute
or
more
like
a
--
a
trust
issue.
if
we
were
to
look
at
it
as
a
trust
issue,
what
would
be
the
result
of
that?
what
kind
of
test
would
we
use?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
olson,
on
your
view
of
showing
detrimental
reliance,
i
take
it
you
would
require
each
employee
to
come
forward
and
say
yes,
i
read
this
spd,
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
and
doesn't
that
really
misunderstand
the
realities
of
the
workplace?
very
few
people
read
their
spds,
but
you
only
need
one
person
to
read
the
spd
to
come
in
and
say,
by
the
way,
folks,
21,000
of
us
are
not
getting
our
retirement
benefits
for
the
next
few
years,
and
within
a
day
every
employee
in
the
workplace
is
going
to
know
about
that.
so
doesn't
this
give
an
incredible
windfall
to
your
client,
cigna,
or
to
other
companies
that
commit
this
kind
of
intentional
misconduct
if
you
hold
them
to
this
detrimental
reliance
standard?
