is
the
--
is
the
common
question
of
law
or
fact
whether,
given
the
training
which
central
management
knew--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--given
the
facts
about
what
people
say
and
how
they
behave,
many
of
which
central
management
knew,
and
given
the
results
which
central
management
knew
or
should
have
known,
should
central
management
under
the
law
have
withdrawn
some
of
the
subjective
discretion
in
order
to
stop
these
results?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that
is
a
fair
way
to
put
it,
is
that
a
question
that
every
one
of
the
women
in
this
class
shares
in
common?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
just
spend
one
second,
remember
my
question.
we've
got
a
common
issue.
why
isn't
that
enough
at
least
to
support
a
(b)(2)
injunctive
action?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
sounds
like
the
merits
you're
getting
to.
his
point,
remember,
is
this
is
just
certification.
so,
my
question
is:
assuming
they
can
support
it
with
evidence,
why
can't
they
have
their
(b)(2)
class,
at
least
on
an
injunctive
relief?
