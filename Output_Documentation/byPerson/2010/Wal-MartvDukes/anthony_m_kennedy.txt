the
chief
justice's
question
reminds
me
somewhat
of
our
rule
in
monell
under
1983:
a
city
is
not
liable
for
a
--
a
constitutional
violation
unless
it
has
a
policy.
would
you
think
that
we
could
use
that
as
an
analogue
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
common
question
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose,
following
the
monell
analogue,
there's
--
it's
a
--
there's
a
showing
of
deliberate
indifference
to
the
violation.
would
that
be
a
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
clear
to
me:
what
is
the
unlawful
policy
that
wal-mart
has
adopted,
under
your
theory
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
that
the
--
your
complaint
faces
in
two
directions.
number
one,
you
said
this
is
a
culture
where
arkansas
knows,
the
headquarters
knows,
everything
that's
going
on.
then
in
the
next
breath,
you
say,
well,
now
these
supervisors
have
too
much
discretion.
it
seems
to
me
there's
an
inconsistency
there,
and
i'm
just
not
sure
what
the
unlawful
policy
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
that
disparate
treatment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
i
thought
the
teamsters
case
was
an
action
by
the
government
that
wasn't
a
class
action
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
pattern
or
practice,
that's
correct.
help
me,
if
you
can,
with
this.
let's
--
let's
suppose
that
experts'
testimony,
sociologists
and
so
forth,
establish
that
in
industry
generally
and
in
retail
industry
generally,
women
still
are
discriminated
against
by
a
mathematical
factor
of
x.
you
have
a
company
that
has
a
very
specific
policy
against
discrimination,
and
you
look
at
their
--
the
way
their
employees
are
treatment
--
are
treated,
and
you
find
a
disparity
by
that
same
mathematical
factor
x,
does
that
give
you
a
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
--
the
disparity
with
--
that
women
are
subjected
to
are
the
same
in
the
company
as
they
are--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--society
wide,
but
the
company
does
have
a
policy
against
discrimination.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that
be
true
even
if
you
could
not
show
deliberate
indifference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there's
no
deliberate
indifference
and
a
specific
policy
prohibiting
the
discrimination,
can
you
still
proceed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it's
standardless
and
--
and
recordless,
then
why
is
there
commonality?
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
--
your
answer
that
you
just
gave
really
is
a
--
shows
a
flaw
in
your
case
on
commonality.
