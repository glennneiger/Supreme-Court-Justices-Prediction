alito,

what
do
you
think
is
the
difference
between
the
standard
that
the
district
court
was
required
to
apply
at
the
certification
stage
on
the
question
whether
there
was
a
company-wide
policy
and
the
--
the
standard
that
would
be
applied
on
the
merits?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
to
be
that
this
typical
company
would
be
in
violation
of
title
vii;
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
what
the
--
and
that's
what
the
academic
literature
on
which
your
theory
is
based
includes;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so,
you
have
the
company
that
is
absolutely
typical
of
the
entire
american
workforce,
and
let's
say
every
single
--
there
weren't
any
variations.
every
single
company
had
exactly
the
same
profile.
then
you
would
say
every
single
company
is
in
violation
of
title
vii?
