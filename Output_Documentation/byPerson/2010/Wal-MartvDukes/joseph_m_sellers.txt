mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
follows
from
the
--
the
teamsters
and
watson
models
of
theories
of
discrimination,
and
as
a
consequence,
there
is
no
requirement
to
have
a
formal
policy
of
discrimination
here.
it
can
be--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--the
injunction
would
look
like
a
series
of
remedial
measures
that
would
direct
wal-mart
to
provide
for
detailed
criteria
by
which
to
make
pay
and
promotion
decisions
that
are
job-related
in
a
way
that
hasn't
been
true
up
until
now.
it
would
provide
for
it
to
hold
managers
accountable
for
the
decisions
they
make;
it
would
ensure
effective
oversight
of
the
--
of
these
pay
and
promotion
decisions
in
a
way
that
the
company
had
--
while
the
company
did
have,
by
the
way,
information
regularly
submitted
to
it
about
pay
decisions,
it
took
no
action,
and
it
did
not
effectively
monitor
--
allowed
these
problems
to
fester.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
no,
not
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
several
thousand
stores.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
some
examples
in
the
record.
as
teamsters--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--that's
correct.
we
don't
submit
that.
there
is
no
minimum
number
that
this
court
has
ever
set.
teamsters,
as
an
example
in
teamsters,
the
court
had
before
it
about
40
examples,
but
significantly
they
weren't
required.
in
order
to
establish
a
pattern
and
practice
of
liability
--
and
we
have
more
than
that,
of
course
--
but
in
order
to
establish
a
pattern
and
practice
of
liability
or
at
least
a
prima
facie
case,
teamsters
holds
that
what
you
need
to
do
is
show
that
there
were
disparities
sufficiently
substantial
to
create
an
inference
of
discrimination
with
respect
to
a
discrete
practice.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
mr.
chief
justice,
the
position
--
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
fair
comparison.
the
position
that
wal-mart
has
advanced
makes
no
--
the
comparison
it
makes
is
with
the
general
population,
not
with
people
in
retail.
wal-mart's
obligation
under
title
vii
is
to
ensure
that
its
managers
do
not
make
pay
decisions
because
of
sex,
and
the
comparison
that's
relevant
is
between
men
and
women
at
wal-mart,
not
the
general
population
that
includes
people
in
retail,
but
includes
railroad
workers
and
all
kinds
of
other
people.
that's
not
the
appropriate
comparison.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
justice
kennedy,
our
theory
is
that
wal-mart
provided
to
its
managers
unchecked
discretion
in
the
way
that
this
court's
watson
decision
addressed
that
was
used
to
pay
women
less
than
men
who
were
doing
the
same
work
in
the
same
--
the
same
facilities
at
the
same
time,
even
though
--
though
those
women
had
more
seniority
and
higher
performance,
and
provided
fewer
opportunities
for
promotion
than
women
because
of
sex.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
justice
kennedy,
there
is
no
inconsistency
any
more
than
it's
inconsistent
within
wal-mart's
own
personnel
procedures.
the
company
provides
to
its
managers
this
discretion,
which,
by
the
way,
is
very
discrete.
it
is
not
the
broad
kind
of
--
we're
not
attacking
every
facet
of
the
pay
and
promotion
decisions.
the
district
court
found
specific
features
of
the
pay
and
promotion
process
that
are
totally
discretionary.
there's
no
guidance
whatsoever
about
how
to
make
those
decisions.
but
with
respect
to
the
discretion,
every
store,
the
district
court
found,
is
provided
--
managers
are
provided
with
the
same
level
of
discretion.
but
the
company
also
has
a
very
strong
corporate
culture
that
ensures
that
managers,
not
just
with
respect
to
the
practices
we're
challenging,
but
in
all
respects,
what
they
call
the
wal-mart
way,
and
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
ensure
that
in
these
various
stores
that,
contrary
to
what
wal-mart
argues,
that
these
are
wholly
independent
facilities,
that
the
decisions
of
the
managers
will
be
informed
by
the
values
the
company
provides
to
these
managers
in
training--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--it
is
disparate
treatment.
it
is
a
form
of
disparate
treatment
because
they
are
making
these
decisions
because
of
sex,
and
they
--
and
they
are
doing
so
with
--
we
have
evidence
that
we
think,
through
the
stereotyping
evidence
we
have
here,
as
well
as
the
statistical
results--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--well,
justice
scalia,
there
is
this
broad
discretion
given
the
managers.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
but
they
do
not
make
these
decisions
in
a
vacuum.
they
make
the
decisions
within
a
company
where
they
are
heavily--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--no,
i'm
not.
i'm
suggesting
they
are
given
this
discretion,
but
they
are
informed
by
the
company
about
how
to
exercise
that
discretion.
so,
it's
effectively
saying--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--well,
all
right.
that's
another
--
it's
certainly
--
the
bottom
line
is,
they
didn't,
and
the
results
show
it.
there
was
consistent
disparities
in
every
one
of
the
regions,
41
regions.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
that
was
a
written
policy.
that
was
not
the
policy
that
was
effectively
communicated
to
the
managers.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
what
we
have,
as
i
said
before,
is
evidence
of
--
for
instance,
at
the
--
at
the
sam
walton
institute,
where
every
manager
has
to
be
trained
before
they
become
a
manager,
they
provide
as
a
question
--
a
response
to
a
standard
question:
why
are
women
so
underrepresented,
or
so
few
women
in
management?
and
the
response
given
was,
because
men
seek
advancement,
are
more
aggressive
in
seeking
advancement.
now,
that's
a
typical,
stereotypical
statement
provided
to
every
person
going
through
the
management
training
program,
that
they
then
go
off
and
inform
--
that
informs
their
decisions
when
they
make
--
when
they
have
this
discretion
to
make
promotions.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
that's
--
that
is--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--well,
they
--
they
have
--
they
have
an
intent
to
take
sex
into
account
in
making
their
decisions;
that
is
--
that
is,
they
apply
a
stereotype
about
that
women
are
less
aggressive
when
it
comes
to
assessing
their
suitability
for
promotions.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
i
understand
that,
and
there
were
--
there
have
been
women
promoted.
but
justice
scalia,
first
of
all,
we
think
that
that
is
--
the
questions
you
are
raising
are
ones
that
wal-mart
can
raise
at
trial.
the
question
at
this
juncture
is
whether
there
are
--
there
are
questions
common
to
the
class.
we've
identified
what
has
been
recognized
as
a
--
a
common
policy,
that
there's
no
dispute
this
policy
applies
throughout
the
company.
and
the
fact
that
we,
at
this
juncture,
are
--
i
mean,
and
we
have
shown,
as
we
think
we
have
to
in
order
to
satisfy
commonality,
that
there
are
disparities
adverse
to
women.
and
we
have
the
means
to
show,
through
the
testimony
of
dr.
bielby
and
other
evidence,
that
we
can
provide
this
--
connect
these
two
through--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--we
--
we
have
testimony
in
the
record
from
the
vice
president
of
the
company
that
that
policy
was
lip
service
at
the
company.
we
have
testimony
from
--
from
the
expert
in
this
case--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--that
is--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
the
--
the
approach
that
the
district
court
endorsed,
an
approach
we
recommended,
and
which
has
been
endorsed
by
seven
circuits
over
a
period
of
40
years,
is
in
circumstances
here
--
like
here,
which
are,
admittedly,
the
exception
to
the
rule,
where
the
company
had
no
standards
by
which
to
make
promotion
and
pay
decisions,
they
had
kept
no
records
of
who
--
the
reasons
for
people
being
promoted
and
the
reasons
why
they
pay
people
certain
amounts,
that
as
a
consequence
of
that,
the
albemarle
decision
and
the
teamsters
decision
make
clear
that
the
obligation
of
the
district
court
upon
finding
of
liability
is
to
attempt
to
reconstruct
the
decisions
that
would
have
been
made
in
the
absence
of
discrimination.
and
the
district
court
found
here
--
and
we
submit
it's
not
clearly
erroneous
--
that
the
more
reliable
method
for
doing
so
is
to
use
a
formula
relying
on
wal-mart's
robust
database
in
which
it
captures
performance,
seniority,
and
a
host
of
other
job-related
variables,
factors
that
bear
on
pay
and
promotion
decisions,
and
permits
a
comparison,
a
very
precise
comparison,
in
a
way
that
having
individual
hearings
relying
on
hazy
memories,
post
hoc
rationalizations,
doesn't.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
i
think
if
the
--
if
there
were
--
as
clear
as
your
hypothetical
suggest,
that
the
company
had
a
policy
of
that
sort,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
it
to
seek
summary
judgment.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
you
could
bring
a
class
case
on
behalf
--
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical
--
on
behalf
of
women
--
i'm
sorry
--
who
were
subject
to
discrimination
as
a
consequence
of
that
unchecked
discretion.
i
--
i
want
to
be
clear
that
we
shouldn't
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
we
have
evidence
here
of
results
from
this
that
are,
that
are
really
extraordinary.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
that
--
that
is
a
fair
way
to
put
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
i
--
i
believe
so,
justice
breyer,
because
they've
all
been
the
subject
in
every
one
of
these
stores
to
this
very
broad
discretion.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
actually,
justice
ginsburg,
i
--
i
think
the
district
judge
did
not
find
that.
what
he
found
was
that
the
formula,
and
i
can
assure
you
the
formula
we
intend
--
would
tend
--
tend
to
use
is
a
regression
analysis
that
would
permit
a
comparison
between
each
woman
and
the
amount
she
was
paid
and
similarly
situated
men,
taking
into
account,
as
i
said,
performance
and
seniority
and
the
like,
and
you
will
find
there
are
women
that
were
not
underpaid
and
the
formula
will
show
that
they
should
get
no
back
pay.
i
think
that
the
district
court--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
kind
of
factors
that
are
entered
into
this
--
this
economic
model,
performance
in
particular,
should
capture
whether
somebody
should
have
been
fired.
that
--
that
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
model
here
that
permits
people
to
--
and
we
found
--
the
evidence
shows
that
women
were,
in
fact
--
had
higher
performance
than
men
and
were
nonetheless
still
underpaid.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
that's--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--as
every--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--as
every
class
does,
justice
scalia.
every
class
has
some
portion
of
its
members
who
are
not
harmed
by
the
discrimination.
as
the
teamsters
case
recognized,
what
is
common
about
them
is
they
were
all
subject
to
the
same
highly
discretionary
decisionmaking,
even
if
some
of
them
weren't
harmed
by
it.
that
still
presents
a
question
common
to
the
class.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
that
--
that
is
correct,
but
it
--
it
--
it
is
the
paradigm
we
use
for
determining
what
you
need
to
establish
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
if
the
--
i'm
sorry
--
if
the
--
it,
the
disparity--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--outside
the
company.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
right.
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
company's
responsibility
under
title
vii
is
to
ensure
its
managers
do
not
make
pay
and
promotion
decisions
because
of
sex.
if
the
comparison
between
the
pay
women
receive,
for
instance,
who
are
similarly
situated
to
men
within
the
company
is
such
that
they
are
underpaid
compared
to
similarly
situated
men
in
the
company,
then
--
then
the
company
would
have
legal
responsibility
under
title
vii,
regardless
of
what
happens
in
the
rest
of
the
industry,
what
happens
in
the
rest
of
the
world.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
--
the
respect
that
the
standard
is
deliberate
indifference.
i
think
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
heller--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i
--
well,
i
would
submit
you
still
can
proceed.
if
--
if
the
policy
--
announcing
a
policy
saying
don't
discriminate
were
to
be
effective
in
--
in
immunizing
companies
against
liability
in
class
actions,
imagine
every
company
in
the
country
would
publish
that
policy
and
have
free
license
to
go
discriminate
as
much
as
it
wanted
to.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
with
--
justice
alito,
i
think
it's
not
just
academic
literature,
i
think
it's
the
precedents
from
this
court.
i
think
that's
the
--
that's
the
premise
behind
teamsters,
that
the
--
you
look
to
in
hazelwood,
which
makes
very
clear
that
you
don't
look
to
populations
outside
the
company
in
making
comparisons.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
it
--
that
could
very
well
be
the
case.
if
--
if
the
--
i
think
that
title
vii
holds
companies
responsible
for
the
actions
they
take
with
respect
to
their
employees.
there
certainly
are
industries,
and
there
were
30
years
--
many
more
30
or
40
years
ago
when
teamsters
was
decided,
where
the
entire
industry
might
have
had
evidence
of
discrimination.
that
would
not
--
there
is
not
a
negligence
standard
under
this
statute
that
immunizes
companies
because
they
follow
the
same
standards
as
others.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
no.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
justice
scalia,
i
--
i
--
i
want
to
deal
with
the
--
in
this
instance,
we
have
--
it's
not
just
any
old
analysis
that
we're
--
that
we're
using.
we
have
statistical
regression
analysis
that
isolates
and
takes
into
account
the
factors
such
as
performance
and
--
and
seniority.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
i--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--no,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
take
that
position,
justice
scalia.
what
i
was
trying
to
make
clear
is
that
the
fact
that
there
are
other
companies
in
the
same
industry
where
the
same
problems
may
arise,
which,
by
the
way,
wasn't
true
here,
where
wal-mart
was
behind
the
other
large
retailers,
doesn't
mean
that
a
company
is
any
less
liable
for
the
discrimination
practiced
in
its
own
workplace.
i
can't
speak
for
the
rest
of
society,
i
don't
have
any
reason
to
think
the
entire
society
is
engaging
in
employment
discrimination.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
i
think
it's
a
--
it's
a
call
that,
of
course,
we
leave
--
we
should
leave
to
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance,
but
factors
that
could
weigh
in
the
balance
would
include
whether
or
not
you
have
available
the
kind
of
information
that
we
do
here
from
database
with
which
to
be
able
to
more
reliably
construct
the
--
the
kinds
of
decisions
that
would
have
been
made
in
the
absence
of
discrimination.
likewise,
there
may
be
companies
where
they
have
kept
better
records
or
kept
any
records
or
have
more
substantial
standards
that
would
permit
the
reconstruction
of
those
decisions
through
individual
hearings.
i
don't
think
this
is
something
that
--
i'm
not
contending
that
under
--
that
you
could
always
use
a
formula-like
approach
in
connection
with
these
cases.
this
is
an
extraordinary
case
with
evidence
that
is
--
that
they
have
kept
really
no
standards
and
no
records.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
the
district
--
i'm
sorry,
the
district
court
did
make
the
comment
that
the
sheer
number
of
class
members
would
make
the
administration
of
individual
hearings
difficult,
but
the
district
court
went
on,
very
importantly--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--sorry?
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
he
may
have
said
impossible,
but
the
important
point
is
that
he
went
--
the
district
court
went
ahead
and
made
specific
findings
about
the
extent
to
which
the
--
the
particular
record
here
shows
that
the
use
of
a
formula
would
be
more
reliable
than
individualized
hearings.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
okay.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
that's--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--right.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--yes.
effectively
wal-mart
will
have
ample
opportunity
through
the
arguments
over
which
variables
which
to
use.
there
was
a
very
robust
debate
below
already
about
which
variables
to
use,
that
will
have
a
significant
impact
on
whether
women
are
shown
to
be
underpaid
or
underpromoted
compared
to
men.
so,
wal-mart
will
have
that
opportunity,
and
frankly--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i'm--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--if
wal-mart
--
if
wal-mart,
justice
sotomayor,
if
a
wal-mart
comes
forward
below
and
it
hasn't
done
so,
so
far,
and
is
able
to
persuade
the
district
court
that
it
can,
consistent
with
some
kind
of
--
in
a
way
that's
consistent
with
a
reliable
determination
of
who
should
have
been
paid
what
and
promoted
in
the
absence
of
discrimination--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i'm
trying
to.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
i'm
--
i'm--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i
--
i'm
--
let
me
answer
you
directly.
i'm
not
saying
that.
wal-mart
has
an
opportunity
to
make
the
case
that
with
whatever
showing
it
wishes
to
make
it
can
reconstruct
these
decisions
more
reliably,
and
in
an
entirely
subjective
environment,
and
if
it
does,
it
can
offer
evidence
in
certain
circumstances;
but
it
hasn't
done
so;
and
i
don't
submit
it's
going
to
be
able
to
do
so
here.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
i
think
it
is,
justice
scalia,
because
the--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--well,
i
think
it's
not
the
judicial
system,
it's
the
recordkeeping
of
the
company,
and
the
standardlessness
of
its
--
of
the
pay
and
promotion
processes
that
basically
mean
10
years
later,
these
managers
are
going
to
be
coming
forward
to
speculate
about
what
they
did
10
years
earlier,
with
no
records
to
cross-examine
them
on.
that
is
not
the
--
the
model
for
a
reliable
adjudication.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i
--
justice
scalia,
i
submit
it
is;
and
the
circuits
that
have
been
considering
this
for
40
years
have
so
held.
in
the
narrow
set
of
circumstances
that
we
have
here,
where
there
are
standardless,
recordless
decisions
at
issue.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
no,
justice
kennedy,
the
--
the
standardless
and
recordless
aspect
is
with
respect
to
trying
to
reconstruct
these
decisions
years
later.
as
i
said
before,
we
have
a
common
policy
here;
it
presents
a
common
question.
we've
shown
evidence
that
would
probably
create
a
prima
facie
case
of
pattern
or
practice
under
teamsters,
and
we
think
we've
satisfied
the
three
components
of
commonality
that
we
think
need
to
be
addressed.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--well,
i
don't
--
nobody
knows
that,
because
they
continue
to
have
more
employees
adding
--
added
at
the
company.
so,
i
wouldn't
presume--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--well,
there
are
people
leaving,
but
the
point
--
but
more
importantly,
the
advisory
committee
note
with
respect
to
rule
23(b)(2)
makes
clear
that
there
is
a
--
that
the
--
whether
or
not
an
action
or
inaction
is
taken
with
respect
to
the
class
which
is
the
predicate
to
(b)(2)
certification,
it
depends
on
--
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
number
of
people
who
are
adversely
affected
by
that
action.
and
so,
as
a
consequence
where
the
former
employees
are
--
that
they
--
if
they
would
be
included
in
the
class
under
(b)(2)
because
that
--
the
question
is
not
on
a
day-to-day
basis
who
should
have
been
in
a
position
to
seek
injunctive
relief
and
who's
employed
and
who's
not.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
thank
you.
