justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
thought
their
expert
didn't
aggregate
them
together.
he
did
it
regionally,
not
store
by
store,
as
your
expert
did,
number
one;
and,
number
two,
that
he
performed,
as
accepted
by
the
district
court,
and
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court,
any
number
of
controlled
variable
comparisons,
including
job
history,
job
ratings,
and
other
things,
and
found
that
the
disparity
could
not
be
explained
on
any
of
the
normal
variables
that
one
would
expect
and
that
the
disparity
was
significantly
much
higher
than
the
10
competitors
of
wal-mart
and
what
they
were
paying
their
labor
force.
so,
what
is
speculative
about
that,
number
one?
and,
two,
why
is
that
kind
of
statistical
analysis
inadequate
to
show
that
a
policy
of
some
sort
exists?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
begs
the
legal
question,
which
is
--
you're
right.
ultimately,
you
may
win
and
prove
to
a
factfinder
that
this
analysis
is
fatally
flawed,
but
what
the
district
court
concluded
was
that
on
the
basis
of
your
expert,
whom
he
discounted
because
your
expert
was
--
was
basing
analysis
on
--
on
premises
that
the
court
found
not
acceptable,
that
there
was
enough
here
after
a
rigorous
analysis.
what's
the
standard
that
the
court
should
use
in
upsetting
that
factual
conclusion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
would--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--would
that
bar
the
(b)(2)
class?
meaning
if
their
claim
is,
as
they
state
it,
that
they're
seeking
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
against
a
discriminatory
impact
or
--
case
or
a
pattern
and
practice
case,
wouldn't
that
have
value
and
wouldn't
that
value
be,
standing
alone
without
the
damages
component,
be
that
the
plaintiffs
who
come
in
later
have
a
presumption
that
discrimination
affected
them
and
the
burden
shifts
to
wal-mart
to
prove
that
there
was
a
nondiscriminatory
reason?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
if
they
did,
why
couldn't
you
separate
out
the
(b)(2)
issue
from
the
(b)(3)
question
of
whether
monetary
damages
have
enough
common
facts
and
law
to
warrant
a
certification
under
(b)(3)?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so,
would
you
address
the
--
address
them
separately
for
me,
and
tell
me
why
a
(b)(2)
class
couldn't
exist
only
on
injunctive
relief?
and
if
it
can,
if
you're
conceding
it
can,
then
is
your
attack
merely
that
the
monetary
component
of
this,
the
back
pay
--
which,
you
know,
i
know
the
dispute
on
whether
that's
equitable
relief
or
compensatory
relief
or
not
--
why
that
just
can't
be
separated
out
and
put
into
the
(b)(3)
claim?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
begs
my
question.
are
you
talking
about
any
monetary
relief?
you're
--
you're
claiming,
i'm
assuming,
that
monetary
relief
includes
equitable
relief.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
fifth
circuit
has
described
a
test
where
it
doesn't
use
the
predominant
question;
it
uses
the
incidental
test.
what's
wrong
with
that
test?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
that's
where
i'm
going
to.
would
you
accept
that
incidental
test
as
appropriate
to
the
question
of
when
monetary
damages
predominate
or
don't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
the
injunction
look
like
in
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
i'm
--
i'm
a
little
confused,
all
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
you're
saying
an
individualized
hearing
is
impossible,
but
that's
exactly
what
you're
saying
you're
going
to
do,
only
through
statistics.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
going
to
say
through
my
statistical
model,
i
will
be
able
to
identify
those
women
in
the
class
who
are
deserving
of
pay
raises.
what
that
doesn't
answer
is
when
in
this
process
is
the
defendant
going
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
defend
against
that
finding?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
you're
--
are
you
suggesting
that
the
district
court
would
appropriately
bar
a
defendant
where
there's
no
proof
of
intentionality
with
respect
to
not
keeping
records,
that
it
was
intended
to
stop
these
women
from
collecting
money,
et
cetera?
when
are
they
going
to
get
a
chance?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
if
they're
going
to
get
a
chance,
isn't
that
an
individualized
hearing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
that
sounds
like
you're
saying
their
only
opportunity
will
be
on
the
model.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
will
be
precluded
from
attempting
to
show
any
particular
evidence
that
a
particular
decision
was
not
made?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
not
answering
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
--
what
you're
saying
is
we're
going
to
preclude
them
from
doing
anything
but
offering
a
mathematical
model--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
otherwise
it's
going
to
be
too
hard
to
have
individual
hearings.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
--
you
don't
seriously
contend
that
if
a
plaintiff,
if
a
policy
were
found
or
practice
of
discrimination
that
a
woman
couldn't
come
in
and
say
they
put
x
in,
i
had
a
longer
history
at
wal-mart,
i
had
far
superior
job
ratings,
i
had
no
criticisms
of
my
work,
and
i
wasn't
promoted.
wouldn't
that
be
enough
for
her
to
show
that
that
policy
influenced
her
lack
of
selection?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
your
personal
database
has
all
that
information.
so,
why
is
it
impossible
to
try
these
cases
other
than
because
of
their
large
numbers?
that's
a
different
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
he's
just
making
your
--
their
point,
which
is
if
they
started
paying
women
the
same
as
men,
they
might
get
more
diversity.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
the
whole
issue
that's
in
dispute.
