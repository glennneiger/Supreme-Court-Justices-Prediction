i
don't
think
that's
quite
fair,
mr.
boutrous.
i
think
their
argument
was
that
the
common
policy
was
one
of
complete
subjectivity,
was
one
of
using
factors
that
allowed
gender
discrimination
to
come
into
all
employment
decisions.
and
in
watson,
we
suggested
that
that
was
a
policy,
a
policy
of
using
subjective
factors
only,
when
making
employment
decisions.
that's
exactly
the
policy
that
was
alleged
here.
justice
elena
kagan
i
--
i
guess
i'm
just
a
little
--
a
little
bit
confused
as
to
why
excessive
subjectivity
is
not
a
policy
that
can
be
alleged
in
a
title
vii
pattern
and
practice
suit
or
in
a
title
vii
disparate
impact
suit.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
boutrous,
i
think
that
that
suggests
that
the
plaintiffs
would
have
to
demonstrate
discrimination
in
every
individual
case,
and
that's
never
been
the
law.
all
that
the
plaintiffs
have
to
demonstrate
and,
especially
at
this
stage
in
the
proceedings,
is
that
there
is
a
practice,
a
policy
of
subjectivity
that
on
the
whole
results
in
discrimination
against
women,
not
that
each
one
of
these
women
in
the
class
were
themselves
discriminated
against.
justice
elena
kagan
i
thought
your
position
was
that
this
could
not
be
certified
under
rule
23(b)(3),
either;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you're
not
suggesting
that
they
would
be
precluded
on
individual
discrimination
claims,
are
you?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
sellers,
could
i
take
you
back
to
the
remedial
question
here--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
when
you
think
it
is
that
individualized
hearings
are
required?
you've
described
a
kind
of
formula
that
you
would
use.
when
--
when
--
when
is
the
formula
approach
right
and
when
is
the
individual
hearings
approach
right?
