mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
mandatory
nationwide
class
in
this
case
was
improperly
certified
for
two
fundamental
reasons.
first,
plaintiffs
failed
to
satisfy
rule
23(a)'s
cohesion
requirements
as
reflected
in
the
commonality,
typicality,
and
adequacy
requirements
of
the
rule.
second,
plaintiffs'
highly
individualized
claims
for
monetary
relief
failed
to
satisfy
rule
23(b)(2)'s
requirements
for
certification
of
a
mandatory
non-opt-out
class.
regarding
rule
23(a),
because
the
plaintiffs'
claims
in
this
case
hinge
on
the
delegation
of
discretion
to
individual
managers
throughout
the
country,
they
cannot
meet
the
cohesion
requirements
that
are
reflected
in
--
in
rule
23(a).
the
delegation
of
discretion
in
some
ways
is
the
opposite
of
cohesive
claims
that
are
common
to
everyone
in
the
class.
the
common
policies
that
the
plaintiffs
point
to
are
either
neutral
and
not
argued
to
be
discriminatory
or
they
are
affirmatively
nondiscriminatory.
the
company
has
a
very
strong
policy
against
discrimination
and
in
favor
of
diversity.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
this
situation,
if
there
was
a
pattern,
for
example,
at
a
particular
store
where
the
decisionmaking
unit--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--that
--
i
think
that
would
be
an
inquiry,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
would
rise
to
a
pattern
or
practice
or
a
common
policy
that
affects
everyone
in
the
same
way.
certainly,
companies
do
look
at
the
--
the
situation
throughout
the
company
and
seek
to
root
out
discrimination,
but
it
would
take
more
than
some
reports,
especially
in
--
in
a
company
that
has
so
many
stores
and
so
many
units.
and
here,
the
plaintiffs'
claims
simply
aren't
typical.
if
the
three
named
plaintiffs
stand
before
the
court,
they
are
supposed
to
represent
500,000
or
a
million
or
more
people
and
stand
in
judgment
--
that's
the
words
the
court
used
in
hansberry
v.
lee
--
to
represent
all
those
other
people.
and
the
claim
is
that
the
individual
decisionmakers
in
those
other
cases
exercised
their
discretion
in
a
way
that
was
biased,
and
there's
no
proof
of
that.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
analogue
is
that
if
a
company
had
a
policy,
a
general
policy,
of
discrimination
as
opposed
to
here,
where
it's
a
general
policy
against
discrimination,
and
it
was
--
in
the
words
of
the
court
in
feeney,
saw
patterns
throughout
the
company
and
because
of
sex,
because
of
gender,
continued
to
allow
the
patterns
to
exist,
that
would
raise
a
different
question.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
deliberate
indifference
raises
a
different
question.
under
a
disparate
treatment
claim,
again,
in
feeney,
the
test
would
be,
was
the
company
allowing
the
discrimination
to
occur
because
of
gender,
because
it
wanted
there
to
be
discrimination?
there's
no
evidence
of
that
here.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
your
honor,
yes,
there
is
an
obligation
to
ensure
--
for
a
company
to
do
its
best
to
ensure
there
are
not
wage
gaps
and
discrimination.
but
here,
for
example,
if
one
looks
at
the
aggregated
statistics
that
the
plaintiffs
have
pointed
to,
it
points
to
a
completely
different
issue.
it
does
not
show
that
there
were
gender
gaps
at
the
stores
among
comparable
people.
that's
really
the
fundamental
flaw
in
their
case.
their
argument
is
that
individual
decisionmakers
throughout
the
country
were
making
stereotyped
decisions
and
that
that
had
a
common
effect,
but
they
just
added
everything
together.
they
haven't
shown
a
pattern
across
the
map.
they've
added
all
the
data
together
and
pointed
to
disparities,
some
of
which
mirror
some
of
the
--
the
statistics
that--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--justice
sotomayor,
first,
plaintiffs'
expert
did
a
national
regression
and
then
simply
estimated
the
regional
results.
he
did
not
do
a
regional
regression.
but
even
if
he
had,
these
statistics
go
more
to
the
merits.
we
think
we
have
strong
arguments
on
the
merits
responding
to
those
statistical
arguments--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--your
honor,
the
district
judge
did
not
discount
wal-mart's
expert.
the
district
court
found
that
it
wasn't
the
stage
at
which
to
make
a
determination
between
the
two.
the
standard
that
we
think
would
govern
would
be
the
standard
that
the
second
circuit
adopted
in
the
ipo
case,
which
says
there
needs
to
be
a
choice.
when
you're
talking
about
discretionary
decision
around
the
country
by
different
decisionmakers,
there
has
to
be
some
demonstration
that
there's
a
common
effect
throughout
the
system.
our
expert's
report
and
testimony
showed
that
at
90
percent
of
the
stores,
there
was
no
pay
disparity.
and
that's
the
kind
of
--
and
even
putting
that
aside,
the
plaintiffs
needed
to
come
forward
with
something
that
showed
that
there
was
this
miraculous
recurrence
at
every
decision
across
every
store
of
stereotyping,
and
the
evidence
simply
doesn't
show
that.
the
--
the
other
problem
on
the
--
on
the
cohesion
analysis
is
that
--
again,
the
typicality
inquiry.
each
of
the
plaintiffs
have
very
different
stories.
one
of
them
was
promoted
into
a
managerial
position.
one
was
terminated
for
disciplinary
violations.
one
was
promoted
and
then
had
a
disciplinary
problem
and
then
was
demoted.
in
each
of
these
cases,
if
this
were
an
individual
case,
they
would
have
to
show
that
they
were
treated
differently
than
people
who
were
situated
just
like
them,
with
the
same
supervisor,
the
same
department,
the
same
situation.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
at
the
certification
stage,
justice
alito,
the
plaintiffs
did
not
have
to
prove
that
there
was
an
actual
policy
of
discrimination
and
that
that
was
the
company's
policy,
but
they
at
least
needed
to
point
to
a
policy
that
was
common
and
that
linked
all
of
these
disparate
individuals
and
disparate
locations
and
different
people
together.
and
--
and
one
--
their
argument
is
that
the
common
policy
is
giving
tens
of
thousands
of
individuals
discretion
to
do
whatever
they
want.
that
is
not
commonality.
it's
the
opposite.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
justice
kagan,
they
do
not
argue
that
it
was
an
entirely
subjective
process.
as
the
court
suggested
in
falcon,
entirely
subjective
would
--
would
be
a
different
issue.
they
argue
that
it
was
excessive
subjectivity
and
that
there
were
general
overarching
company
standards
that
exerted
control.
on
page
--
i
think
it's
on
page
13
of
their
brief,
they
say
the
discretion
was
unguided.
three
pages
later
they
say
it
was
guided
by
these
nondiscriminatory
policies.
so,
it's
really
an
incoherent
theory
that
does
not
have
--
pose
the
kind
of
situation
you're
suggesting.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
your
honor,
in
watson,
the
court
did
suggest
--
did
state
and
--
and
hold
that
subjective
decisionmaking
could
be
challenged
in
a
disparate
impact
case,
but
justice
o'connor's
opinion
went
on
to
say
there
needs
to
be
the
identification
of
a
specific
practice
within
that
policy.
as
the
court
said
in
falcon,
title
vii
does
not
govern
policies;
it
governs
practices.
and
subjectivity
is
not
a
practice
if
it
were
a
policy.
and
there
was
a
--
like
most
companies,
wal-mart
has
a
combination
of
objective
and
subjective
standards.
within
that,
the
plaintiffs
--
if
they
had
pointed
to
some
particular
criteria,
people
with
a
great
personality,
they're
going
to
--
they're
--
they're
the
ones
we're
going
--
we're
going
to
push
up,
and
they
--
they
were
trying
to
tie
that
to
a
disparate
impact
or
disparate
treatment,
that
would
be--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--your
honor,
this
--
this
is
not
like
the
total
person
test,
but
i
think
that
is
a
very
good
example
of
something
that
could
be
a
--
a
practice
inside
the
--
the
overarching
policies,
and
if
you
had
a
case
where
a
particular
decisionmaking
unit
applied
the
total
practice
test,
and
you
had
disparate
results
in
that
particular
unit,
that
group
of
people
could
--
could
--
would
have
a
much
stronger
case
for
a
class
action.
but
as
your
honor
points
out,
the
--
the
sociologist
here,
who
is
the
glue
that's
supposed
to
hold
this
class
together,
said
he
couldn't
tell
if
stereotyping
was
occurring
one-half
of
1
percent
or
95
percent
or
at
all.
and
this
is
a
class
action.
the
question
here
is
whether
that
we
can
assume
that
every
decisionmaker
acted
in
the
same
manner
in
a
way
that
had
in
this
court's
words
the
same
injury,
caused
--
the
plaintiffs
had
the
same
interest
and
the
same
injury,
that's
the
way
the
court
put
it
in
amchem,
by
their
own
expert
accepting
all
of
their
proof,
the
answer
is
no.
that
assumption
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
that's
why
there's
not
the
kind
of
cohesion
that's
necessary
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
absent
class
members
and
the
defendant.
the
--
the
--
the
other--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
at
the
phase
one,
we're
not
arguing
that
a
plaintiff
would
have
to
come
forward
and
show
that
every
class
member
was
discriminated
at
that
point.
under
the
teamsters'
analysis,
there
must
be
proof
of
a
standard
operating
procedure
of
discrimination.
here,
it's
undisputed
that
wal-mart's
policy
--
and
it
wasn't
just
a
written
policy;
it
was
implemented
and
enforced
rigorously
--
that
was
antidiscrimination.
but,
your
honor,
you're
correct,
that
each
person
doesn't
have
to
come
forward
in
phase
one.
the
big
--
the
other
big
problem
here
is
that
the
district
judge
said
in
phase
two,
under
teamsters,
wal-mart
would
not
be
entitled
to
put
on
its
individual
defenses.
women
who
thought
they
had
a
claim
would
not
be
able
to
come
forward
if
a
--
in
this
process,
the
paper
records
suggested
they
didn't
have
a
claim,
and
come
into
court
and
have
their
day
in
court
and
argue
that
they
should
be
compensated.
the
plaintiffs
are
trying
to
cut
off
half
of
the
teamsters'
framework,
which
is
fundamental
both
to
due
process
and
to
title
vii
because
title
vii's
section
706(g)
states
very
clearly
that
only
victims
of
discrimination
may
recover.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
if
the
class
prevails,
then
the
--
the
claim
would
be
resolved
in
this
manner
under
--
it's
very
unclear
what
the
district
court
had
in
mind.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
she
would
only
be
eligible
for
back
pay.
the
plaintiffs
retained
their
compensatory--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--their
compensatory
damage
claims
for
themselves
but
waived
those
for
the
class
members
in
order
to
get
a
class
certified,
which
i
think
is
a
fundamental,
crucial
violation.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
our
view
is
that
she
would
not
be
because
that
would
have
been
part
of
the
core
nucleus
of
facts
in
the
case.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
that's
the
--
that's
the
problem
--
that
goes
to
the
problem
with
this
(b)(2)
certification,
that
this
case,
if
it
--
if
it
were
going
to
be
certified
at
all,
needed
to
be
looked
at
under
rule
23(b)(3).
rule
23(b)(3)
was
--
was
created
for
precisely
this
sort
of
circumstance,
the
growing
edge
of
the
law
where
individualized
monetary
claims
are
at
stake.
the
--
the
language
of
rule
23(b)(2)
speaks
of
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
our
view
is
the
plaintiffs
will
--
will
not
be
able
to
satisfy
those
--
those
provisions,
but
that's
why
they
brought
it
under
rule
23(b)(2),
to
circumvent
the
procedural
protections
of
superiority,
predominance,
and
the
like.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
there
certainly
could
be
a
benefit
from
an
injunction
if
--
if
the
plaintiffs
met
all
the
standards.
the
problem
here
is
that
the
--
the
individualized
damage
claims,
the
back
pay
claims,
engulfed
and
overwhelm
the
injunctive
relief--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--your
honor,
some
courts
have
done
that,
looked
at
the
injunctive
relief
claims
under
--
under
the
(b)(2)
standard
and
the
monetary
reliefs
under
a
(b)(3)
standard.
that
can
raise
other
complications,
especially
here
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
punitive
damages
as
well,
but
that's
at
least
a
possibility.
it
would
certainly
be
better
than
this,
shoe-horning
these
monetary
relief
claims
that
are
so
individualized.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
your
honor,
our
view
is
that
the
injunctive
relief
claim
still
has
significant
problems
concerning
cohesion,
adequacy,
typicality,
commonality.
on
the
adequacy
point,
this
case
includes
at
least
544
store
managers
who
are
alleged
to
be
discriminators
and
victims.
if
that's
not
a
conflict
under
amchem
and
the
adequacy
test
in
hansberry
v.
lee,
i
don't
know
what
is.
the
--
the
women
who
are
compelled
to
be
in
the
class
--
they
can't
opt
out,
they're
current
employees,
they're
former
employees,
they
cut
across
every
position
in
the
country,
and
there's
no
demonstration
that
they're
being
affected
in
a
common
way.
so,
i
think
there
would
still
be
those
commonality,
typicality,
cohesion
problems
because
of
the
nature
of
the
plaintiffs'
case
here,
the
notion
of
the
common
policy
being
giving
--
giving
discretion
and
--
and
independent
judgment.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
the
district
court,
justice
ginsburg,
limited
that
ruling
to
the
punitive
damage
claim,
and
the
ninth
circuit
made
clear
it
was
viewing
it
that
way.
it
said
under
its
ruling,
which
sent
punitive
damages
back,
that
would
simplify
things
because
then
there
wouldn't
have
to
be
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
opt
out
under
back
pay.
and
back
pay
is
monetary
relief
for
individuals.
to
bind
people
based
on
a
balancing
test
under
(b)(2)
to
a
judgment
to
which
they
were
not
a
party
--
in
taylor
v.
sturgell,
this
court
talked
about
the
fundamental
rule
that
an
individual
is
not
bound
by
a
judgment
to
which
they're
not
a
party
and
said
we
need
crisp
rules
with
sharp
corners
in
this
area
where
such
a
fundamental
right
is
at
stake.
and
that's
why
we
think
it
needs
to
be
rule
23(b)(3)
when
individual
monetary
relief
is
at
stake.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
that
test
is
much
better
than
the
test
that
was
applied
below.
the
plaintiffs
have
walked
away
from
the
two
tests
that
were
applied
in
the
lower
court.
they
have
never
contended
they
could
meet
the
incidental
damages
test.
and
under
the
fifth
circuit's
case,
the
allison
case,
only
automatic
back
pay
that
goes
to
the
group
as
a
whole
would
qualify
for
that.
here,
this
is
individualized
relief.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
your
honor,
the
text
of
rule
23(b)(2)
is
very
clear.
it
talks
about
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
the
only
ambiguity
that's
created
is
from
the
advisory
committee
note,
and
as
this
court
said
three
weeks
ago
in
the
milner
case,
we
don't
look
to
legislative
history
to
try
to
create
ambiguities.
the
--
the
other
parts
of
the
advisory
committee
notes
make
very
clear
that
the
drafters
were
concerned
about
the
historical
antecedents
where
it
was
an
injunctive-only
case
to
--
of
--
to
desegregate
and
the
like.
i
think
the
drafters
of
rule
23(b)(2)
would
have
been
shocked
if
they
had
learned
that
this
case
that
involves
millions
of
claims
for
individualized
monetary
relief
were
--
were
being
sought
to
be
included
in
a
(b)(2)
class.
that
said,
your
honor,
the
incidental
damage
test
is
--
is
i
think
far
superior
because
it's
at
least
clearer
and
would
be
closer
to
a
sharp,
bright-line
rule,
which
is
required
in
this
context.
i'd
like
to
go
back
briefly
to
the
point
i
made
earlier
about
individual
relief
and
taking
away
the
rights
of
both
wal-mart
and
the
absent
class
members.
the
procedures
that
would
be
used
here
--
the
ninth
circuit
proposed
a
statistical
sampling
method.
the
plaintiffs
do
not
defend
that.
they
do
not
mention
the
hilao
case,
which
was
the
cornerstone
of
the
--
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling,
which
would
allow
sort
of
a
prediction
about
who
might
have
been
hurt,
how
many
people
might
have
been
hurt,
and
then
a
divvying
up
of
--
of
moneys
based
on
that.
the
district
court
precluded
the
fundamental
teamsters
hearings,
which
would
allow,
once
a
presumption,
if
one
was
to
arise,
of
discrimination
occurred
in
a
pattern
of
practice
--
would
allow
the
defendant
to
then
show
that
it
didn't
discriminate
on
--
on
an
individual
basis,
and
it
would
allow
the
individuals
to
come
in
and
have
their
day
in
court.
that
violates
title
vii.
it
violates
the
rules
enabling
act,
and
--
and
we
think
it
really
shows
some
of
the
core
flaws
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there's
a
presumption
in
--
in
the
world
of
class
actions
--
there's
two
that
i
think
the
plaintiffs
are
--
are
relying
on.
one
is
that
class
actions
are
always
good,
and
the
bigger
the
class
action,
the
better,
and
that
the
class
will
win.
none
of
those
presumptions
can
be
counted
on.
if
the
plaintiffs
lose,
and
they
--
and
here
their
compensatory
damages
claims,
i
think,
would
be
gone
because
the
named
plaintiffs
are
asserting
them.
if
they
tried
to
bring
a
case
as
pattern
or
practice
or
pay
or
promotion,
there
would
be
significant
questions
of
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel.
and
it's
not
fair
to
anyone
to
put
this
all
into
one
big
class.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
no,
your
honor,
if
they
had
individual
claims
that
were
separate
from
the
nucleus
of
operative
facts
here,
that
might
pose
a
different
question.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
then
i
--
then
there
would
be
a
real
problem
of
collateral
estoppel
or
res
judicata,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
begin
with
this
question
of
back
pay
because
mr.
sellers
has
made
clear
under
their
vision
wal-mart
would
never
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
it
didn't
discriminate
against
a
woman
who
was
seeking
back
pay;
and
the
district
court
did
not
suggest
that
it
might
be
difficult,
as
mr.
sellers
suggested.
the
district
court,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
said
that
he
found
it
would
be
impossible;
not
just
because
of
the
number
of
people,
but
because
of
the
nature
of
the
claims,
that
discretionary
decisions
were
being
implemented
in
a
way
that
affected
different
people
differently.
the
--
the
problem
here
mr.
sellers
says
is
that
the
records
are
not
available.
then
he
says
we're
going
to
have
a
--
a
proceeding
where
the
district
judge
relies
only
on
the
records,
that
he
says
are
inadequate,
to
allow
a
reconstruction
of
the
decision.
that
is
not
a
process
known
to
our
jurisprudence.
it
doesn't
comport
with
due
process.
it
takes
away
wal-mart's
rights
under
title
vii;
it
injures
the
rights
of
the
individual
women,
who
the
record--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--i
agree
with
you,
justice
sotomayor.
except--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
what
you've
just
outlined,
we
agree
that
a
woman
should
be
able
to
come
in
and
say
that,
and
she
may
say
well,
the
records
don't
show
what
really
happened.
i
--
i
had
more
experience;
i
was
a
much
better
employee
than
the
guy
working
next
to
me.
under
the
plaintiff's
theory
in
order
to
get
a
class
here,
they
have
thrown
that
out
the
window;
that
woman
would
not
be
able
to
come
and
testify.
wal-mart
wouldn't
be
able
to
say
this
person
was
a
terrible
employee,
this
person
was
a
great
employee.
on
the
record,
it's
not
impossible
to
recreate
these
decisions.
the
record
is
filled
with
declarations
from
managers
who
remember
very
well
that
ms.
dukes
violated
company
policy,
that
ms.
arana
was
fired
for
infractions
regarding
how
she
kept
her
hours.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
your
honor,
the
--
the
scenario
you
outline
--
there's
no
dispute
about
the
policies
that
existed
at
the
time,
that
there
were--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--because,
your
honor,
the
--
the
common
policy
is
one
that
affects
everyone
differently
by
definition.
therefore,
these
plaintiffs
are
not
typical,
and
they
are
not
arguing
that
everyone
was
affected
the
same
way
by
the
common
policy.
many
women
thrived.
maybe
some
men
stereotyped
or
some
women
stereotyped
the
other
direction.
five
hundred
and
forty-four
of
the
plaintiffs
are
female
store
managers.
so,
it's
impossible
to
make
these
sweeping
generalizations,
which,
of
course,
is
what
stereotyping
is
supposed
to
prevent.
and
so,
it's
--
there's
absolutely
no
way
there
can
be
a
fair
process
here.
on
the
policy
question,
the
policy
--
the
plaintiffs
point
to
the
general
policies
and
the
central
control,
but
the
one
policy
they
do
not
want
to
confront
is
the
policy
against
discrimination.
it
was
not
just
a
written
policy
on
paper.
in
fact,
the
--
there's
a
declaration
at
page
1576
of
the
joint
appendix
that
lays
out
the
very
aggressive
efforts
the
company--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--i'm
glad
you
asked
about
that,
justice
scalia.
here's
what
he
said.
he
testified
about
the
diversity
goals
of
the
company
at
the
time,
the
effort
to
get
more
women
into
management,
and
he
said
in
his
view,
until
the
company
linked
diversity
goals
to
compensation
of
managers,
it
would
be
lip
service.
he
wasn't
saying
the
whole
program
was
lip
service.
he
was
one
of
the
advocates
for
diversity
in
the
company.
he
wanted
to
be
more
aggressive.
he
said
his
--
his
goals
were
20
percent
and
other
people's
were
10.
so
--
so,
it's
completely
misleading
to
suggest
he
was
--
he
was
denigrating
the
entire
policy.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
they
do
pay
the
same
as
men,
your
honor.
the
record
reflects
that.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
thank
you.
