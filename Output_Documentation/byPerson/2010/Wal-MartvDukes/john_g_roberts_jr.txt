chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-277,
wal-mart
stores
v.
dukes.
mr.
boutrous.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
if
corporate
headquarters
had
learned
that
the
subjective
decisionmaking
or
the
delegation
of
decisionmaking
to
the
field
was
resulting
in
several
discriminatory
practices
or
a
pattern
of
discrimination
--
in
other
words,
the
decentralized
process
was
leading
to
discrimination
--
then
i
suppose
the
company
--
that
that
could
be
attributed
to
the
policy
adopted
by
--
at
headquarters?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
about
--
so,
they've
got
thousands
of
stores,
and,
you
know,
every
week
they
get
a
report
from
another
store
saying
that,
you
know,
there's
an
allegation
of
gender
discrimination.
at
some
point,
can't
they
conclude
that
it
is
their
policy
of
decentralizing
decisionmaking
that
is
causing
or
permitting
that
discrimination
to
take
place?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
happens
to
the
damages
claim
of
an
individual
woman
who
is
part
of
this
class
if
that
class
prevails?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
--
would
she
be
eligible
for
only
back
pay
or
compensatory
damages
as
well?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
but
would
--
would
the
--
would
the
women
with
a
claim
for
compensatory
damages
be
able
to
sue
that
after
the
class
prevails
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
--
even
though
she
could
have
not
received
notice
and
not
had
an
opportunity
to
opt
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
class
does
--
does
not
prevail;
it
loses?
does
that
bar
an
individual
woman
at
a
particular
wal-mart
from
bringing
these
same
claims?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
if
it
were
the
same
theory,
that
the
reason
this
person
was
able
to
discriminate
was
because
he
had
total
subjective
discretion
in
his
hiring?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
sellers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
is
it
your
position
that
on
this
scale
subjective
decisionmaking
processes
are
necessarily
illegal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
if
this
were
--
how
many
stores
are
we
talking
about,
a
thousand
stores?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
several
thousand
stores.
how
many
examples
of
abuse
of
the
subjective
discrimination
delegation
need
to
be
shown
before
you
can
say
that
flows
from
the
policy
rather
than
from
bad
actors?
i
assume
with
three
--
however
many
thousands
of
stores,
you're
going
to
have
some
bad
apples.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know
there
are
examples.
how
many
do
you
need
to
have?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
surely
it
won't
be
--
if
somebody
sends
one
letter
in
saying
the
guy
at
this
plant
--
is
--
plant
--
this
store
is
discriminating,
that
can't
be
enough
to
support
your
theory.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
--
is
it
true
that
wal-mart's
pay
disparity
across
the
company
was
less
than
the
national
average?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
had
a
situation
where
you
had
a
company
with
a
very
clear
policy
in
favor
of
equal
treatment
of
men
and
women?
you
know,
the
answer
to
your
--
the
answer
to
your
question
was
women
don't
have
as
many
positions
because
managers
discriminate
against
them
in
--
in
hiring
and
in
promotion,
yet
you
still
have
the
same
subjective
delegation
system.
could
you
have
a
class
of
women
who
were
harmed
by
this
subjective
policy,
even
though
it
was
clear
that
the
policy
of
the
corporation
favored
equal
employment
opportunity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
no,
they
still
--
well,
then
you're
saying
it
is
not
enough
that
it
be
a
subjective
decision.
this
company
has
a
thousand
stores,
and
sure
enough
in
a
thousand
stores
you're
going
to
be
able
to
find
a
goodly
number
who
aren't
following
the
company's
policy,
who
are
exercising
their
subjective
judgment
in
a
way
that
violates
the
right
to
equal
treatment.
couldn't
you
bring
a
class
of
people
subjective
to
discrimination
as
a
result
of
that
subjective
policy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
boutrous,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
