i
don't
--
i'm
getting
whipsawed
here.
on
the
one
hand,
you
say
the
problem
is
that
they
were
utterly
subjective,
and
on
the
other
hand
you
say
there
is
a
--
a
strong
corporate
culture
that
guides
all
of
this.
well,
which
is
it?
it's
either
the
individual
supervisors
are
left
on
their
own,
or
else
there
is
a
strong
corporate
culture
that
tells
them
what
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
there's
no
discretion;
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
somebody
tells
you
how
to
exercise
discretion,
you
don't
have
discretion.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
know
about
--
about
the
unchallenged
fact
that
the
central
company
had
a
policy,
an
announced
policy,
against
sex
discrimination,
so
that
it
wasn't
totally
subjective
at
the
managerial
level?
it
was,
you
make
these
hiring
decisions,
but
you
do
not
make
them
on
the
basis
of
sex.
wasn't
that
the
central
policy
of
the
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
how
was
--
how
was
that
established?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
causes
them
intentionally
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
causes
--
how
could
that
possibly
cause
them
to
intentionally
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that's
just
an
assessment
of
why
the
percentage
is
different.
they
differ
not
only
at
wal-mart,
but
at
--
throughout
the
industry.
to
say
that
that's
the
explanation
is
not
to
tell
your
people:
don't
promote
women.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
have
an
aggressive
woman,
promote
her.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
you
sufficiently
shown
--
despite
the
fact
of
an
explicit
written
central
policy
of
no
discrimination
against
women,
do
you
think
you've
adequately
shown
that
that
policy
is
a
fraud,
and
that
what's
really
going
on
is
that
there
is
a
central
--
a
central
policy
that
promotes
discrimination
against
women?
do
you
really
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
i
just
say
something
here?
doesn't
your
class
include
both
those
women
who
were
underpaid
and
both
--
and
those
women
who
weren't
underpaid?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
your
class
include
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
commonality?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
--
what
--
what's
--
what's
your
answer
assumes
is
if
there
is
a
disparity
between
the
advancement
of
women
and
the
advancement
of
men,
it
can
only
be
attributed
to
sex
discrimination--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
otherwise,
how
could
you
say
that
all
--
all
of
the
companies
are
--
are
--
are
presumptively
engaging
in
sex
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
see,
i
wasn't
talking
about
this
case.
i
was
talking
about
your
answer
to
justice
alito--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
said
that,
you
know,
it
may
well
be
that
every
industry
in
the
united
states
is
guilty
of
sex
discrimination--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
there
--
you
know,
there
--
there's
equality
of
promotion
for
men
and
women.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
--
this
takes
evidence,
to
establish
that
--
that
it's
more
reliable
to
have
a
hearing
with
evidence
on
the
particular
promotion
or
dismissal
of
the
individual,
that
that
is
more
reliable
than
using
--
i
don't
care
how
admirable
a
statistical
guess
you
make;
i
mean
is
that
really
a
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
must
have
a
pretty
bad
judicial
system
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
should
use
that
in
jury
trials,
too,
for
really
old
cases.
we
should
just
put
a
statistical
model
before
the
jury
and
say,
you
know,
this
stuff
is
too
old;
so,
we'll--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we'll
do
it
on
the
basis
of
--
is
this
really
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fact
it's
more
than
half
the
class
that's
gone,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
nobody's
leaving
yet.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
vice
president
that
said
it
was
just
window

or
something
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
concerns
one
of
the
most
expansive
class
actions
in
our
history.
respondents,
women
who
are
current
and
former
employees
of
petitioner
wal-mart,
brought
this
suit
against
the
company
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
a
nationwide
class
of
some
1.5
million
female
employees.
they
alleged
that
wal-mart's
local
managers
exercise
their
considerable
discretion
over
pay
and
promotions
disproportionately
in
favor
of
men
in
violation
of
the
disparate
impact
and
disparate
treatment
prohibitions
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
their
suit
seeks
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief,
punitive
damages
and
backpay.
the
district
court
certified
respondents'
proposed
class
after
finding
that
it
satisfied
the
requirements
of
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
23(a)
and
23(b)(2).
on
appeal,
the
ninth
circuit
made
a
few
modifications
to
the
class
but
substantially
affirmed
the
district
court's
certification
order.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
the
class
was
properly
certified.
we
conclude
that
it
was
not,
for
two
independent
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
addressed
in
part
ii
of
my
opinion
for
the
court,
which
is
concurred
in
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
kennedy,
thomas
and
alito.
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
23(a)(2)
requires
a
party
seeking
class
certification
to
demonstrate
that
"there
are
questions
of
law
or
fact
common
to
the
class".
to
satisfy
that
rule,
a
plaintiff's
claims
must
depend
upon
a
common
contention
that
is
capable
of
classwide
resolution
which
means
that
determination
of
its
truth
or
falsity
will
resolve
in
one
stroke
an
issue
that
is
central
to
the
validity
of
each
one
of
the
claims.
wal-mart
is
the
nation's
largest
private
employer.
it
operates
four
types
of
retail
stores
throughout
the
country
which
are
divided
into
seven
nationwide
divisions
and
subdivided
into
41
regions
of
80
to
85
stores
apiece.
each
store
has
between
40
and
53
separate
departments
and
80
to
500
staff
positions.
in
all,
wal-mart
operates
approximately
3400
stores
and
employs
more
than
1
million
people.
because
respondents
wish
to
sue
about
literally
millions
of
employment
decisions
at
once,
they
need
some
glue
holding
the
alleged
reasons
for
all
those
decisions
together.
otherwise,
it
will
be
impossible
to
say
that
an
examination
of
all
the
class
members'
claims
for
relief
will
produce
a
common
answer
to
the
question
that
matters
to
title
vii,
why
was
i
disfavored?
one
of
our
prior
cases,
general
telephone
company
of
southwest
versus
falcon
describes
how
the
commonality
issue
must
be
approached.
that
case
explained
that
there
is
a
wide
gap
between
an
individual's
claim
of
discrimination
and
the
existence
of
a
class
of
persons
who
have
suffered
the
same
injury
as
that
individual,
so
that
the
individual's
claim
and
the
class
claim
will
share
common
questions
of
law
or
fact.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
according
to
falcon,
bridging
that
game
--
bridging
that
gap
requires
"significant
proof"
that
wal-mart
"operated
under
a
general
policy
of
discrimination".
that
proof
is
entirely
absent
here.
as
respondents
acknowledge,
wal-mart's
official
corporate
policies
forbid
sex
discrimination.
the
only
direct
evidence
of
a
general
policy
of
discrimination
respondents
produced
was
the
testimony
of
a
sociologist,
who
concluded
that
wal-mart's
strong
corporate
culture
made
the
company
"vulnerable"
to
gender
bias.
but
that
sociologist
admitted
that
he
could
not
calculate
whether
--
"whether
0.5
percent
or
95
percent
of
the
employment
decisions
at
wal-mart
might
be
determined
by
stereotyped
thinking".
so
his
testimony
is
worlds
away
from
the
significant
proof
of
a
discriminatory
policy
that
falcon
requires.
indeed,
the
only
corporate
policy
that
the
plaintiffs'
evidence
convincingly
establishes
is
wal-mart's
policy
of
allowing
discretion
by
local
supervisors
over
employment
matters.
on
its
face,
of
course,
that
is
just
the
opposite
of
a
human
--
of
a
uniform
employment
practice
that
would
provide
the
commonality
needed
for
a
class
action.
it
is
a
policy
against
having
uniform
employment
practices,
that
one
particular
supervisor
exercises
his
discretion
in
a
discriminatory
way,
does
--
does
nothing
to
establish
--
be
patient,
that
any
other
manager
does
so.
in
a
company
of
wal-mart's
size
and
geographical
scope,
it
is
quite
unbelievable
that
all
managers
would
exercise
their
discretion
in
a
common
way
without
some
common
direction.
respondents
attempt
to
make
that
showing
by
means
of
statistical
and
anecdotal
evidence,
but
reasons
we
explain
in
our
opinion,
their
evidence
falls
far
short.
we
therefore
first
conclude
that
the
plaintiff
class
was
improperly
certified
under
rule
23(a).
the
second
independent
reason
why
this
certified
class
was
improper
is
set
forth
in
part
iii
of
the
opinion
for
the
court
which
is
unanimous.
the
district
court
certified
this
class
under
rule
23(b)(2),
which
applies
when
"the
party
opposing
the
class
has
acted
or
refused
to
act
on
grounds
that
apply
generally
to
the
class,
so
that
final
injunctive
relief
or
corresponding
declaratory
relief
is
appropriate
respecting
the
class
as
a
whole."
but
the
plaintiffs'
claims
are
not
limited
to
the
kinds
of
relief
named
in
that
rule.
besides
injunctive
relief
or
corresponding
declaratory
relief,
they
seek
awards
of
backpay
that
is
money
to
individual
class
members.
we
have
previously
expressed
out
that
any
monetary
claims
can
be
certified
under
rule
23(b)(2).
we
need
not
resolve
that
broader
question,
however,
because
we
conclude
that
at
a
minimum,
claims
for
individualized
monetary
relief,
like
--
like
a
backpay
at
issue
here,
do
not
satisfy
the
rule.
as
our
opinion
explains,
the
key
to
a
(b)(2)
class
is
the
indivisible
nature
of
the
relief
requested.
the
notion
is
that
the
defendants'
conduct
is
such
that
it
can
be
enjoined
or
declared
unlawful
only
as
to
all
of
the
class
members
or
as
to
none
of
them.
just
as
(b)(2)
does
not
authorize
certification
when
each
class
member
would
be
entitled
to
a
different
injunction,
neither
does
it
apply
when
each
class
member
seeks
individualized
award
of
money.
that
interpretation
accords
with
the
historical
antecedents
of
--
of
the
(b)(2)
and
with
the
overall
structure
of
the
rule.
we
conclude
that
class
actions
to
recover
backpay
belong
instead
in
rule
23(b)(3).
that
rule
contains
several
procedural
protections
that
the
(b)(2)
class
does
not.
protections
that
are
particularly
important
when
individual
money
claims
are
at
stake.
in
a
(b)(3)
class,
the
district
court
is
required
to
provide
absent
class
members
with
notice
of
the
lawsuit
and
an
opportunity
to
opt-out
of
the
class.
and
it
is
required
to
find
that
common
issues
predominate
over
individual
issues,
and
that
class
treatment
is
a
superior
method
of
adjudication.
these
findings
are
considered
unnecessary
to
a
(b)(2)
class,
but
they
are
indispensable
when
individualized
claims
are
at
stake.
the
fifth
circuit
has
suggested
that
monetary
relief
can
be
part
of
the
(b)(2)
class
if
it
is
incidental
to
the
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief
requested.
we
need
not
decide
that
question
today
because
respondents'
backpay
claims
are
not
incidental
to
anything.
because
title
vii
provides
wal-mart
with
certain
statutory
defenses
to
backpay
that
it
is
entitled
to
--
to
litigate
as
to
each
employee,
resolving
those
claims
will
require
individualized
determinations
of
liability.
the
ninth
circuit
believed
it
was
possible
to
replace
these
proceedings,
these
individualize
adjudications,
with
a
sort
of
trial
by
formula
under
which,
entitlement
to
backpay
and
the
amount
of
entitlement
would
be
calculated
for
a
sample
set
of
the
plaintiffs
and
those
results
then
extrapolated
over
the
entire
1.5
million
class.
we
disapprove
that
project.
the
rules
enabling
act
forbids
interpreting
the
federal
rules
to
"abridge,
enlarge
or
modify
any
substantive
right"
including
wal-mart's
statutory
defenses.
wal-mart
is
in
entitled
to
litigate
those
defenses
and
the
necessity
of
that
litigation
demonstrates
that
respondents'
backpay
claims
are
not
incidental.
for
these
and
other
reasons
set
forth
more
fully
in
our
opinion,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
breyer,
sotomayor
and
kagan
have
joined.
