justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
any
responsibility
if
you
--
the
numbers
are
what
has
been
left
out
so
far.
the
company
gets
reports
month
after
month
showing
that
women
are
disproportionately
passed
over
for
promotion,
and
there
is
a
pay
gap
between
men
and
women
doing
the
same
job.
it
happens
not
once,
but
twice.
isn't
there
some
responsibility
on
the
company
to
say,
is
gender
discrimination
at
work,
and
if
it
is,
isn't
there
an
obligation
to
stop
it?
justice

mr.
boutrous,
there
was
a
case,
it
was
in
the
'70s,
and
it
was
a
class
action
against
at&t
for,
i
think,
promotion
into
middle
management.
what
was
at
issue
there
was
a
part
--
a
test,
part
objective,
but
then
in
the
end,
the
final
step
was
a
so-called
total
person
test,
and
women
disproportionately
flunked
at
that
total
person.
and
the
idea
wasn't
at
all
complicated.
it
was
that
most
people
prefer
themselves;
and
so,
a
decisionmaker,
all
other
things
being
equal,
would
prefer
someone
that
looked
like
him.
and
that
was
found,
that
total
--
the
application
of
that
total
person
concept
was
found
to
be
a
violation
of
title
vii.
this
sounds
quite
similar.
i
mean,
it's
not
just
--
it's
not
subjective.
you
have
an
expert
--
i
know
you
have
some
questions
about
that
expert
--
but
the
expert
saying
that
gender
bias
can
creep
into
a
system
like
that
simply
because
of
the
natural
phenomenon
that
people
tend
to
feel
comfortable
with
people
like
themselves.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
--
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
that
this
district
judge
said
that
--
that
the
absent
class
members
would
get
notice
and
have
an
opportunity
to
--
to
opt
out.
so,
a
--
a
plaintiff,
a
member
of
the
class
who
wants
to
go
for
compensation
instead
of
just
back
pay
could
opt
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
this
something
that
would
be
--
i
mean,
this
--
we're
not
just
talking
about
getting
your
foot
in
the
door.
we're
talking
about
certifying
the
class,
and
you
may
well
lose
on
every
one
of
these
points,
but
--
but
the
23(a)
standards,
they're
not
supposed
to
be
very
difficult
to
overcome.
it's
just
a
common
question
of
fact--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
dominates
at
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
what
seems
to
me
is
a
very
serious
problem
in
this
case
is:
how
do
you
work
out
the
back
pay?
you
say
--
we
get
through
the
23(a)
threshold.
we
got
class
certified
under
23(b)(2).
and
the
judge
says,
there's
no
way
i
could
possibly
try
each
of
these
individuals.
so,
we're
going
to
do
it
how?
how
are
they
going
to
calculate
the
back
pay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
district
judge
didn't
think
so.
didn't
the
district
judge
say
that
in
awarding
back
pay
some
would
get
a
windfall
and
others
would
be
uncompensated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
--
i
thought
his
point
was
not
simply
that
some
women
were
not
underpaid,
but
women,
if
you
had
an
individual
case,
the
employer
might
show
this
person
could
have
been
fired,
disciplined,
and
wasn't
owed
any
back
pay,
not
that
she
compares
favorably
to
a
--
a
male
peer,
but
that
she
wouldn't
have
gotten
any
pay
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought,
didn't
the
district
judge
say
because
of
the
numbers
we
couldn't
--
couldn't
possibly
have
the
hearing
in
each
case
on
whether
the
particular
woman
was
owed
back
pay?
they
did
say
something
about
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
he
said
"impossible".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
he
said
more
than
difficult.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
thing
you
haven't
touched
on
is
to
--
to
have,
first
of
all
the
question
of
whether
(b)(2)
is
limited
to
injunction
and
declaratory
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
--
if
you
follow
the
advisory
committee's
note,
then
if
dollars
--
if
damages
predominates
--
if
damages
predominate,
then
you
can't
use
(b)(2).
you
have
to
make
your
case
under
(b)(3);
and
the
one
factor
here
is
that
about
half
the
class
is
gone,
so
--
they're
not
interested
in
injunctive
relief,
but
everybody's
interested
in
money.
so,
why
isn't
the
money
--
why
do
you
say
that
the
--
that
the
injunction
--
injunctive
relief
is
the
thing
and
the
damages
are
lesser,
rather
than
the
other
way
around?
