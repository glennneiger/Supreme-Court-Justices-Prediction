justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
don't
know
that
you
answered
justice
kennedy's
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
you
answered
his
question.
his
question
was:
if
you
can
deny
or
deny
on
the
merits,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
two?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
there's
two
choices,
so
they
have
to
have
different
meanings
in
some
way.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
showed
us
the
docket
for
that
day--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--of
the
denial
here,
and
there
were
different
ones.
if
it's
the
same
court
taking
action,
why
would
they
choose
one
over
the
other
for
particular
cases?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
what
--
that's
feeding
into
your
adversary's
argument,
that
when
the
court
does
a
summary
denial,
you
don't
know
whether
it's
procedural
or
merits.
that's
his
argument.
you're
adopting
his
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
was
the
basis
of
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
took
14
months
for
this
petition
to
be
filed
to
the
state
court.
do
you
have
cases
that
show
whether
those
14
months
are
presumptively
unreasonable
under
california
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
is
great
validity,
you
think,
to
your
timeliness,
so
this
timeliness
claim.
and
despite
that,
you
believe
the
silent
denial
was
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
they
say
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
they
explicitly
say
in
every
single
case
you
have
to
consult
an
expert?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
did
they
say
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
given
the
nature
of
the
issues,
that
consultation
would
have
been
effective?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
could
take
issue
with
the
timing
of
that
consultation,
but
let's
assume
that
it
turns
out
afterwards
that
if
he
had
consulted
an
expert,
that
that
expert
would
have
told
him
that
one
of
those
blood
spots
absolutely
had
to
be
klein's
near
the
bedroom.
you
would
have
no
quarrel
with
saying
it
would
have
been
ineffective
for
that
counsel
to
have
failed
to
confer
with
an
expert,
wouldn't
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
would
say,
even
if
the
expert
were
to
--
an
expert
would
have
given
that
kind
of
exculpatory
information,
that
that
would
not
have
been
ineffective?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
talking
--
i
gave
you
a
hypothetical
different
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
take
the
ninth
circuit
to
be
saying,
if
you
are
in
an
area,
and
you
are
a
lawyer,
where
you
have
no
expertise
and
your
case
depends
on
a
technical
issue,
it
behooves
you
to
at
least
talk
to
an
expert
to
find
out
if
you
are
on
the
right
track.
and
if
you
fail
to
and
you
get
something
that's
completely
exculpatory,
you
are
ineffective.
so
i
posed
the
hypothetical:
if
an
expert
would
have
looked
at
all
of
these
test
results
and
said,
that
has
to
be
klein's
blood
there,
it
can't
be
johnson's
for
this
reason,
you
are
positing
that
even
under
that
circumstance
there
would
not
have
been
ineffectiveness
for
the
failure
to
consult
with
an
expert?
is
that
what
you
are
telling
us?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
keep
wanting
to
return
to
this
case,
and
i
respect
why
you
want
to,
but
i
am
positing
a
hypothetical
that
underlies,
i
think,
the
ninth
circuit's
point.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
may
well
be
in
this
case
that
the
consultation
would
have
resulted
in
no
prejudice.
that's
different
from
whether
it
was
effective
to
ignore
a
consultation.
those
are
two
different
questions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
there
is
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
importance
of
this
pool
of
blood,
but
as
i
read
detective
bell's
testimony,
he
never
posited
or
talks
about
how
that
pool
was
formed.
only
your
expert
knows
that.
what
bell
does
talk
about,
however,
is
that
there's
a
high-velocity
blood
splatter
in
front
of
the
couch
and
that
the
pooling
of
blood
on
klein's
face
shows
that
he
was
shot
there.
your
experts
do
nothing
to
refute
that
testimony,
which
was
really
the
basis
of
bell's
testimony.
he
had
nothing
to
say
about
the
pool
of
blood.
he
talked
about
why
klein
was
shot
where
he
was
shot.
and
there
is
no
expert
testimony
to
refute
that.
so
how
do
you
get
past
there
being
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
different
verdict
when
there
is
nothing
to
refute
the
critical
testimony
at
issue,
that
klein
was
shot
where
he
was
shot
because
there's
high-velocity
blood
splatter
in
front
of
him
and
because
the
pooling
on
his
face
shows
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
explain
the
blood
pooling
in
the
face
for
me?
you
talk
about
the
high-velocity.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
having
a
very
hard
time
with
your
reliance
on
that
footnote
because
the
very
last
paragraph
of
that
footnote
says
when
respondent's
asserts,
and
i'm
shortening
the
introductory
line,
a
state
procedural
bar
and
when
nevertheless
our
order
disposing
of
a
habeas
corpus
decision
does
not
impose
the
proposed
bar
or
bars
as
to
that
claim,
that
signifies
that
we
considered
respondent's
assertion
and
have
determined
that
the
claim
or
subclaim
is
not
barred
on
the
procedural
ground.
so
the
footnote
itself
says
unless
we
invoke
the
procedural
bar
we
are
not
applying
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
others
could
apply
in
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
wasn't
part
of
the
cert,
the
question,
we
added
the
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
i'm
saying
they
didn't
raise
it
to
start
with,
we
added
the
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
wasn't
as
if
they
were
trying
to
get
around
their
own
waiver?
