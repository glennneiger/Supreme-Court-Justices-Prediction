mr.
clifford
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
has
invited
briefing
in
the
additional
question
presented
on
the
application
of
aedpa
in
this
case,
and
in
light
of
the
court's
many
questions
this
morning,
i
want
to
address
that.
but
i
did
want
to
clear
up
one
piece
of
information
that
seems
to
be
confusing
in
the
record,
and
if
i
can
start
with
that.
this
was
in
response,
i
think,
to
a
question
you
asked,
justice
ginsburg,
regarding
the
--
the
prejudice
prong
of
the
strickland
claim.
and
the
question
was:
why
is
it
--
why
is
it
not
--
why
is
it
harmless?
and
counsel
suggested
that
there
was
an
absence
of
blood
between
the
blood
pool
and
the
couch.
detective
bell
testified
to
that.
and
i
just
want
to
clear
up,
because
i
know
this
--
this
bit
was
confusing
in
the
briefs,
too:
that
is
not
what
detective
bell
testified
to.
if
you
look
at
pages
181
and
195
in
the
reporter's
transcript
in
exhibit
r
5,
you
will
see
that
detective
bell
says,
"yes,
there
were
drops
leading
away
from
the
couch;
yes,
there
were
drops
leading
away
from
the
blood
pool.
"
and
in
fact,
exhibit
r5
is
a
picture
of
the
couch,
and
you
can
indeed
see--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--indeed.
but
the
state's
theory,
the
defense
theory,
was
that
the
body
had
been
moved
from
the
blood
pool
--
not
the
bed,
the
blood
pool
--
to
the
couch.
and
the
state's
response,
in
its
briefing
and
today
in
oral
argument,
was
that
there
was
no
blood
trail
between
the
blood
pool
and
the
couch.
and
indeed,
that's
not
what
detective
bell
testified
to.
he
said
there
were
drops
outside
the
blood
pool,
drops
outside
the
couch,
and
when
asked
if
there
was
blood
in
the
carpeting
in
between,
he
said
he
did
not
remember
how
much
blood
there
was
in
between--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--yes,
i
think
he
could
have
lifted
him,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
gardner
no.
mr.
clifford
gardner
no.
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
expert
testimony
about
the
ability
of
someone
to
--
to
lift
a
weight.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
think
he
weighed
between
150
and
160
pounds.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
think
about
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i'm
saying
that
--
that
the
testimony,
and
the
suggestion
that
there
was
no
trail
of
blood
between
the
blood
pool
and
the
couch,
is
not
consistent
with
what
detective
bell
testified
to.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
if
he
--
if
he
falls
in
the
bedroom
doorway,
your
honor,
and
he
falls
in
a
crossfire,
then
johnson
is
in
some
ways
culpable.
now,
we
don't
know
what
the
extent
of
his
culpability
is,
but
if
he's
involved
in
firing
the
first
shot
he
is
culpable.
putting
klein
on
the
couch
and
having
the
state's
theory
that
klein
is
shot
in
cold
blood
on
the
couch
eliminates
his
culpability,
or
eliminates
the
risk
of
it.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
i
can
only
say
that
if
klein
is
caught
in
a
crossfire,
then
johnson
is
culpable.
and
let's
remember,
he
has
drugs
in
the
house.
he
has
scales.
he
has
all
sorts
of
drug
paraphernalia--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i
don't
doubt
that
in
retrospect
he
could
have
come
up
with
a
better
plan,
your
honor.
[laughter]
but
i
do
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
this
plan,
at
least
on
its
face
initially,
in
terms
of
adrenaline
response,
is
going
to
get
him
out
of
a
crossfire
scenario.
mr.
clifford
gardner
let's
take
both
the
high-velocity
blood
splattering
and
the
pooling,
your
honor,
but
let
me
start
with
the
predicate.
and
you
are
right,
detective
bell
did
not
testify
at
all
about
the
formation
of
the
blood
pool,
and
that's
why
this
case
is
not
about
anticipating
the
state's
expert
about
the
blood
pool,
but
about
getting
your
own
for
your
own
case.
turning
to
the
specifics
of
your
question,
the
high-velocity
blood
splatter.
it
actually
wasn't
in
front
of
the
couch,
your
honor.
it
was
to
the
side
and
below
the
arm.
and
let's
remember
detective
bell's
testimony
about
how
the
homicide
occurred,
because
the
state's
theory
was
not
that
pat
klein
was
shot
while
he
was
lying
on
the
couch,
but
that
he
was
sitting
on
the
couch.
and
so
what
is
most
interesting
about
the
high-velocity
blood
splatter,
since
he
was
shot
in
the
head,
is
that
there
is
none
on
the
wall
immediately
behind
the
couch.
this
was
a
matter
of
some
confusion
in
the
briefs
as
well,
but
i
think
it's
going
to
clear
it
up.
there
is
no
high-velocity
blood
splatter
behind
on
the
pristine
white
wall.
so
the
question
is:
if
he
is
shot
while
sitting
up,
the
high-velocity
blood
splatter
that
bell
testifies
to
travels,
oh,
about
4
feet
over
the
couch,
and
then
2
drops
sink
down.
now,
in
terms
of
the
jury
evaluating
that
testimony,
it's
important
to
note
that
detective
bell
gave
a
description
of
what
high-velocity
blood
splatter
is,
and
he
said
it's
a
fan-like
pattern
of
atomized
blood.
and
when
you
look
at
these
2
drops,
these
2
drops
alone
that
travel
4
feet
and
then
drop
straight
down
to
fall
on
a
plastic
bag,
you
see,
as
defense
counsel
pointed
out
in
his
closing
argument,
that
they
are
the
same
size
as
blood
drops
found
in
the
kitchen
on
exhibits
r18
through
r22.
and
detective
bell's
entire
theory
for
why
these
were
high-velocity
is
their
size.
there
was
never
any
dispute
that
there
was
no
shooting
in
the
kitchen.
mr.
clifford
gardner
putting
aside
the
blood
splatter
issue
--
and
these
were
raised
in
the
lower
court
but
not
addressed
--
he
promised
ballistics
testimony
as
well,
which
he
didn't
produce.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
i
think
the
chief
reason
is
that
that
wasn't
part
of
his
theory,
if
you
look.
and
really,
the
guide
to
this,
your
honor,
is
defense
counsel's
own
theory,
because
defense
counsel
stands
up
in
opening
statement
and
he
promises
the
jury
a
theory.
and
the
theory
isn't,
you
are
going
to
hear
2
stories
and
you
are
going
to
have
to
assess
credibility.
his
theory,
as
he
explained
to
the
jury,
was:
the
physical
evidence
will
show
you
pat
klein
was
not
shot
on
the
couch.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
if
this
case
were
about
anticipating
the
state's
decision
to
call
an
expert,
i
would
agree,
but
it's
not.
and
the
reason
it's
not
is
because
we
have
an
insight
as
to
what
defense
counsel's
theory
of
the
case
was
before
the
state
ever
started
its
case,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
agree,
your
honor.
if
i
said
something
that
sounded
like
i
didn't,
i
misspoke.
my
point
is
that
that's
exactly
the
theory.
once
defense
counsel
decides
on
his
defense
--
in
this
case,
i
think
he
picked
the
right
defense.
he
told
the
jury
the
physical
evidence
would
prove
pat
klein
wasn't
on
the
couch,
and
he
could
have
done
that.
but
despite
promising
the
jury
that
the
physical
evidence
would
prove
this,
he
never
consulted
with
someone.
and
one--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--yes,
i
did.
i
didn't
get
back
to
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
testimony
was,
of
course,
about
the
blood
pattern
flow
on
the
face.
and
when
you
read
detective
bell's
testimony
carefully,
that
testimony
has
nothing
to
do
with
where
pat
klein
is
shot.
it
has
to
do
with
the
angle
of
his
face
after
he's
shot.
so
if
he's
shot
on
the
bedroom
--
in
the
bedroom
doorway
and
falls
and
that's
the
angle,
the
blood
flow
would
be
the
same.
so
it
really
--
the
blood
flow
pattern
really
has
little
to
do
with
where
he
was
shot,
but
just
the
angle
of
his
face.
and
getting
back
to
the
blood
splatter
itself,
the
blood
pool
itself,
what's
interesting
in
this
case
now
is
that
even
after
all
these
years,
the
state
has
never
disputed
the
fact
that
the
absence
of
satellite
drops
means
the
state's
theory
is
false.
gunner
johnson
could
not
have
deposited
that
blood,
because
there
was
no
satellite
drops,
which
means
it
has
to
come
from
another
source.
the
only
other
source
is
pat
klein.
mr.
clifford
gardner
if
--
i'm
sorry.
if
the
question
is,
but
for
the
opening
statement,
would
we
still
have
this
argument,
yes,
although
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
to
establish
what
his
theory
was.
the
opening
statement
doesn't
change
the
strickland
analysis.
it
simply
gives
us
an
insight,
an
easier
path
of
knowing
what
counsel's
theory
was.
much
like
the
case
of
wiggins
v.
smith,
where
the
court
looked
at
defense
counsel's
opening
statement
in
the
penalty
case
repeatedly
to
see
what
was
his
theory
and
what
didn't
he
do.
and
when
there
was
a
suggestion
made
in
wiggins
v.
smith
that,
in
fact,
counsel's
theory
was
something
else,
the
court
said
no,
look
at
his
opening
statement.
we
know
what
his
theory
was.
so
it
doesn't
change
the
standard,
but
it
gives
us
a
very
keen
insight
into
what
he
was
thinking
and
when
he
was
thinking
it.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
it
will
come
as
no
surprise
to
know
that
i
disagree
with
that
argument,
your
honor,
and
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
cases
really
came
down
to:
gunner
johnson
v.
petitioner
richter,
who
is
the
jury
going
to
believe?
even
on
the
record
that
counsel
has
described,
the
jury
deliberated
14
hours.
and
remember,
that
record
included
a
surviving
eyewitness,
and
if
you
believe
the
surviving
eyewitness,
the
case
is
over.
the
jury
deliberated
over
14
hours,
asking
for
reinstruction
twice
and
a
rereading
of
testimony
three
times.
and
i
think
there
is
good
reason
for
that.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
i
think
--
actually,
i
agree
with
the
predicate
of
the
question,
your
honor,
and
that
is:
johnson
had
given
a
number
of
stories.
he
had
given
four
or
five
different
stories.
and
after
all,
he
knew
both
klein
and
richter.
when
he
first
spoke
to
the
9-1-1
people,
they
said,
what
happened?
he
said,
5
people
came
in
and
shot
me.
then
he
said
4,
then
he
said
3,
and
when
they
said
"who",
he
said,
"i
don't
know".
so
clearly
gunner
johnson
was
a
compromised
witness,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
that
the
state
has
a
compromised
witness
is
not
the
reason
not
to
research
the
physical
evidence
and
enhance
your
client's
credibility.
it's
more
of
a
reason
to
do
it.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
let
me
take
them
one
at
a
time,
your
honor.
and
in
a
sense,
the
ammo
and
the
gun
safe
the
answer
is
--
is
very
similar.
all
parties
agreed
in
this
case
that
several
weeks
before
the
incident,
gunner
johnson
had
stored
all
his
belongings
at
my
client's
house.
and,
so,
the
only
dispute
was
had
the
--
the
gun
safe
included.
and
this
is
one
of
the
unusual
features,
is
that
the
state's
theory
requires
us
to
believe
that
this
happened
so
he
could
rob
a
gun
safe
that
had
been
at
his
house
for
weeks.
the
question
was
had
--
had
the
material,
the
gun
safe
and
the
ammo,
who's
was
it
and
had
it
been
taken
back
to
gunner's
house.
the
ammo
is
found
in
a
place
with
two
other
things.
it's
found
with
a
scale
used
for
measuring
drugs,
and
it's
found
with
shotgun
ammunition.
now,
the
record
shows
that
gunner
johnson
had
a
shotgun,
and
gunner
johnson
was
a
drug
dealer.
so
the
defense
theory,
of
course,
is
that
this
ammo
wasn't
my
client's.
it
was
gunner
johnson's
and
hadn't
been
moved
back.
similarly,
as
to
the
safe,
there
was
conflicting
testimony
as
to
whether
the
safe
had
ever
been
moved
back.
so,
that
really
is
the
explanation.
and
that,
i
think,
is
why
the
jury
had
such
pause
about
this
case
when
it
heard
the
case.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
think
not.
and
--
and
--
and
we
know
this
again
for
two
reasons.
and
let
me
start
by
saying,
the
fact
is
that
when
counsel
was
asked,
that
wasn't
the
reason
he
gave.
it's
not
as
if
he
--
he
came
to
the
depo
and
said
this
is
my
tactical
reason,
and
so,
we
can
then
say,
okay,
that's
a
reasonable
tactical
decision.
that
wasn't
the
decision
--
reason
he
gave.
when
asked
did
you
decide
not
to
present
or
why
didn't
you
present
this
blood
spatter
testimony,
he
said,
i
simply
didn't
know
this
was
out
there.
and
after
all,
let's
keep
in
mind
this
was
only
his
second
trial
--
his
second
murder
trial.
he
didn't
know
it
was
out
there.
so,
he
didn't
make
that
tactical
decision.
and
that's
the
first
reason.
the
second
reason,
i
think,
is
that
in
--
in
almost
every
case
that
has
ever
addressed
this,
and
i
have
cited
most
of
them,
has
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
when
there
is
a
credibility
determination,
when
a
defense
--
any
defense
attorney
lawyer
worth
his
salt
knows
that
there
is
a
credibility
determination
to
be
made,
the
jury
is
going
to
believe
either
this
story
or
my
client's
story,
it
at
least
behooves
you
to
investigate
to
see
if
the
physical
evidence
can
support
your
position.
you
can
always
make--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i
don't
believe
so.
and
--
and
the
reason,
again,
comes
back
to
the
same
focus
this
court
had
in
wiggins,
another
failure
to
investigate
case.
what
we
know
is
that
counsel
suggested
to
the
--
told
the
jury
in
opening
statement,
this
is
about
the
physical
evidence.
the
physical
evidence
will
show
this.
when
counsel
--
when
it's
clear
that
that's
counsel's
position
in
a
case,
it's
simply
application
of
the
strickland
test.
it's
unreasonable
for
counsel
not
to
at
least
have
investigated
the
physical
evidence
that
he
told
the
jury
would
show
that
klein
wasn't
on
the
couch.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
in
a
situation
where
--
where
counsel's
investigation
will
not
be
exposed
to
the
prosecutor,
and
--
and
there
was
questions
before
about
how
california
procedure
works
and
indeed
once
you
decide
to
name
--
to
call
a
witness,
you
name
him
and
he
becomes,
you
know,
exposed
to
cross-examination
and
for
investigation.
but
at
least
in
terms
of
your
private
investigation
of
a
case,
the
aba
standards
are
fairly
clear
that
even
an
admission
of
guilt
doesn't
affect
your
ability
or
your
obligation
to
defend
him.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
think
ethically
you
couldn't
argue
otherwise
to
the
jury.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
--
i
don't
disagree,
except
that
again
we
come
back
to
the
--
the
notion
from
wiggins,
which
is
you
can't
defend
a
tactical
judgment
that
wasn't
made.
and,
in
fact,
when
counsel
was
asked,
is
this
the
reason
you
did
this,
he
said
no.
i
didn't
call
a
blood
splatter
expert
because
i
didn't
know
it
was
out
there.
i--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i'm
sorry,
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
hypothetical
was
that
counsel's
client
said
he
was
guilty,
not
that
counsel
thought
he
was
guilty.
mr.
clifford
gardner
the
aba
standards
say
that
the
duty
to
investigate,
the
broad
duty
to
investigate
of
defense
counsel
exists,
irrespective
of
the
client's
statements
to
its
lawyer.
mr.
clifford
gardner
in
that
regard,
no,
you
haven't.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
--
i
--
you
know,
i
can
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
from
practical
experience,
i
will
tell
you
the
fact
that
a
client
admits
to
something
doesn't
mean
he
did
it
or
she
did
it.
that's
the
real
world
consequence
that
we
face
as
defense
lawyers.
often
our
clients
tell
us
things
and
you
can't
always
believe
them,
whether
they
say
they
are
innocent
or
whether
they
say
they
are
guilty.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
you
know,
i
would
suggestion
the
false
confession
literature
has
come
out,
and
there
is
plenty
of
it
to
show
that,
in
fact,
that's
not
an
infrequent
occurrence.
mr.
clifford
gardner
in
which
case
i
will
come
back
to
the
answer
that
the
chief
justice
suggested
a
few
moments
ago,
that
that's
not
my
case.
it
seems
like
a
safe
haven
at
this
point.
[laughter]
mr.
clifford
gardner
it
does.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
was
trying
to
use
that
as
a
segue
into
that,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
clifford
gardner
it
worked.
that
rarely
happens,
your
honor.
and
let
me
turn
then
to
the
aedpa
issues
in
this
case,
because
on
march
28,
2001,
this
california
supreme
court
denied
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
my
client's
case
with
an
order
that
said
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
denied.
that
same
day
in
five
other
cases,
noncapital
cases,
the
california
supreme
court
denied
the
writ
saying,
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
denied
on
the
merits.
and
the
state's
position
here
today
and
in
the
briefing
is
that
the
federal
court
should
simply
ignore
that
difference.
and
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case
for
several
reasons.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
actually
i
agree
and
disagree.
in
re
robbins
does
settle
the
matter
from
a
state
law
perspective,
but
not
as
the
attorney
general
has
suggested.
in
re
robbins
says
a
few
things.
first
it
says
that
when
we
deny
a
case
on
the
merits,
we
add
the
phrase
"on
the
merits".
then
it
says
that
when
we
find
a
procedural
default,
we
cite
for
that
default
so
that
everyone
knows.
and
then
it
says
--
and
this
was
in
response,
i
think,
to
a
question
i
think
you
asked,
justice
scalia,
they
say
a
third
thing,
they
say
sometimes
we
will
find
both
that
it
is
meritless
and
it's
defaulted.
and
we
will
say
both.
we
will
cite
a
default
and
we
will
say
it's
not
on
the
merits
as
well,
trusting
that
the
federal
courts
will
give
deference--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--well,
there's
a
whole
bunch
there,
so
let
me
see
if
i
can
--
if
i
can
tease
it
out.
it
is
true
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
had
this
process,
this
procedure
for
a
long
time,
and
of
course
a
development
of
pre-aedpa
world
when
the
fact
that
whether
something
was
on
the
merits
or
not
didn't
really
matter,
the
only
question
was,
was
it
defaulted,
and
if
it
was
defaulted
it
might
bar
federal
review.
whether
it
was
on
the
merits
was
really
irrelevant
because
before
2254(d)
that
really
didn't
matter.
so
that's
where,
and
i
agree
with
the
state
that's
where
those
cases
come
from.
i
don't
believe,
however,
that
the
waiver
argument
is
really
implicated
here,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
gardner
yes.
and
actually
if
the
ninth
circuit
were
the
only
voice
in
the
fray,
your
honor,
i
think
the
argument
would
be
stronger,
but
the
ninth
circuit's
voice
isn't
the
only
voice
in
the
fray
and
that
brings
me
to
ylst.
in
ylst,
of
course,
in
ylst
v.
nunnemaker
is
a
case
which
is
part
and
parcel
of
this
history
from
the
ninth
circuit
of
saying
silent
denial
is
on
the
merits.
in
ylst
v.
nunnemaker
that's
exactly
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
and
it
came
to
this
court
and
the
state
actually
argued
that
it
wasn't
on
the
merits.
and
indeed
this
court
held
that
you
cannot
tell
from
a
silent
denial
whether
it's
on
the
merits
or
not.
that's
the
first
response,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
additional
voices
other
than
the
ninth
circuit.
the
second
is
that
well
after
hunter
v.
aispuro
comes
the
robbins
footnote
and
in
the
robbins
footnote,
and
in
the
robbins
footnote--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
the
only
thing
the
footnote
says.
the
footnote
says
when
we
deny
on
the
merits
we
say
on
the
merits.
when
we
cite
a
procedural
bar
we
mean
a
bar,
and
if
the
state
has
raised
a
bar,
as
they
did
here
and
we
don't
rely
on
it,
that
means
we
haven't
relied
on
a
procedural
bar.
mr.
clifford
gardner
when
you
put
those
together
what
it
means
is
there
was
no
majority
for
a
decision
on
the
merits,
otherwise
they
would
have
said
on
the
merits.
there
was
no
majority
for
a
decision
of
procedural
default,
otherwise
they
had
would
have
said
default,
and
that's
what
a
silent
denial
means
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
ylst.
you
cannot
tell
because
there
are
seven
judges,
there
are
different
claims,
there
are
different
possibilities,
that
is
why
a
silent
denial
is
there
in
state
court.
it's
precisely--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--you
say
either
ground.
there
are
multiple
grounds
for
procedural
default,
your
honor,
under
state
law.
there
are
many
possible
procedural
defaults.
mr.
clifford
gardner
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
gardner
the
question
is
why
deliberate
to
a
majority
when
they
sit
around
a
conference
of
seven
judges.
let's
say
two
judges
believe
there
is
a
procedural
default
of
untimeliness.
two
judges
think
it's
timely,
but
think
it
should
have
been
raised
below.
two
judges
think
it's
both
timely
and
it
didn't
need
to
be
raised
below,
but
it
hasn't
been
pled
with
sufficient
specificity
and
one
judge
thinks
it
is
improper
on
the
merits.
there
is
seven
judges,
they
all
believe
it
should
be
denied,
but
there
is
no
majority
for
any
position.
there
is
no
reason
for
the
california
supreme
court
and
this
is
addressed
more
in
the
amicus
brief
by
the
california
academy
of
appellate
lawyers,
there
is
no
reason
for
the
california
supreme
court
at
that
point
to
spend
a
day,
two
days
debating
it
when
all
seven
judges
agree
there
is
a
reason--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--that
could
be.
mr.
clifford
gardner
that
is
true
and
i
have
been
unclear
and
i
apologize
for
that.
it
is
not
a
binary
choice
between
default
and
merits,
it's
a
choice
between
which
default
and
merits
and
there
are
many
defaults
under
state
law.
when
the
court
denies
timeliness
grounds
it
will
cite
clark.
when
the
court
finds
that
it
has
been
pled
with
insufficient
specificity
it
will
cite
swain.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
timeliness
was
the
only
one
raised
by
the
state,
but
to
be
sure,
like
this
court,
the
california
supreme
court
has
never
been
bound
in
terms
of
its
procedural
default
findings
by
what
has
been
raised
and--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--well,
at
the
risk
of
not
wanting
to
argue
against
my
client,
i
could
give
you
some
that
could
apply
that
haven't
been
suggested
and,
therefore,
are
most
certainly
are
waived.
but
the
california
law
often
requires
that
you
file
your
habeas
petition
in
a
lower
court
first.
reviewing
courts
often
deny
petitions
for
failure
to
file
in
a
lower
court
first.
there
is
a
requirement
that
says
you
must
plead
with
sufficient
specificity.
that's
often
relied
on
by
reviewing
courts.
there
is
a
requirement
that
says
you
must
attach
all
readily
available
documents.
that's
another--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--the
answer
is
no,
i
didn't
request
certification.
when
we
were
in
district
court
and
when
we
were
in
the
ninth
circuit
both
sides
accepted
the
existing
framework
the
ninth
circuit
had
established
that
applies
to
a
silent
denial,
but
only
through
the
lens
of
independent
review.
the
court's
added
question
has
put
both
of
those
at
issue.
