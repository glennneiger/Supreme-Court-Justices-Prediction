justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
a
procedural
issue
in
this
case
before
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
this
case,
they
didn't
reject
it
on
a
procedural
ground.
it
was
a
reasonable
ground
that
they
applied
consistently.
then
the
ninth
circuit
or
the
federal
courts
couldn't
consider
the
claim
at
all;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
in
fact
the
--
they
are
right,
if
in
fact
the
state
was
correct
that
this
was
procedurally
barred,
they
should
have
raised
it
earlier.
they
didn't.
and
if
that
was
correct
and
reasonable
and
proper
under
both
federal
and
state
law,
then
it
shouldn't
be
in
this
subject
at
all;
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
normally,
to
decide
a
matter
on
a
substantive
--
to
have
a
presumption
that
they
are
reciting
it
substantively
rather
than
procedurally
will
help
a
defendant,
though
not
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
they
cite
it
for,
actually,
they
make
a
slightly
different
argument
in
their
brief.
they
say
going
back
to
1974,
there
are
at
least
three
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
have
said
when
the
california
supreme
court
says
nothing,
just
denied,
we
take
that
as
a
decision
to
reach
the
federal
issue
and
deny
it
on
the
merits.
now,
not
in
your
case,
but
in
most
cases
that
will
benefit
a
defendant,
because
it
will
avoid
the
question
of
whether
there's
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
of
a
procedural
nature.
so,
what
they
are
saying
is
that
that's
the
ninth
circuit's
statement
in
three
cases,
and
the
california
supreme
court
over
a
course
of
30
years
has
never
said
to
the
contrary,
which
it
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
do
and
in
other
instances
where
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong,
it
did
do
it.
so,
that,
i
think,
is
a
fairly
strong
argument.
now,
you're
going
to
--
the
only
reason
that
you
are
not
out
of
court
on
your
own
interpretation
is
because
you
will
say
that
the
state
waived
the
procedural
issue.
and
then
they
will
come
back
and
say,
so
did
you.
so,
what
--
what
is
your
response
to
all
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
example,
in
hunter
v.
aispuro
they
quote
it
as
saying
the
following,
the
california
supreme
court's
denial
of
a
state
habeas
petition
"without
comment
or
citation
constitutes
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
federal
claims.
"
and
then
they
have
three
other
cases
roughly
to
the
same
effect.
now
what
you
are
saying
is
that
this
court
should
hold
to
the
contrary,
and
by
the
way,
in
doing
that,
we
will
bar
many
federal
habeas
petitioners
from
the
federal
courts,
because
what
it
will
mean
is
that
there
is
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
in
case
after
case,
which
perhaps
is
an
irrelevant
feature,
but
nonetheless,
the
silence
of
the
california
supreme
court
is
significant,
i
think,
when
faced
with
those
pretty
clear
interpretations
of
what
their
silence
means
by
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
fair
to
say
that
this
in
this
case,
that
every
party
in
the
lower
courts
assumed
this
was
going
to
be
a
merits-related
issue
and
that
some
deference
was
due,
and
that
nobody
ever
said
anything
about
it
being
a
procedural
issue
where
there
would
be
a
procedural
bar
of
some
kind
that
was
either
waived
or
not
waived?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
time
anybody
mentioned
this
procedural
issue
was
when?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
on
the
merits
brief
in
opposition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
was
nothing
before
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
reason
not
to
do
this?
i
am
just
thinking
from
our
point
of
view
--
i
mean,
i
think
it
is
probably
correct
what
you
say;
nobody
mentioned
a
word
about
this
procedural
issue
until
the
brief
in
opposition
on
the
merits,
not
the
cert
brief;
and
the
reason
they
did
was
perfectly
legitimate.
we'd
asked
the
question.
well,
if
we
were
wrong
to
do
that,
and
if
we
took
the
opinion
as
being
a
question
of
reasonable
deference,
et
cetera,
and
went
into
it,
is
there
anything
--
any
reason
not
to
put
in
that
opinion
somewhere,
given
ylst
and
given
the
ninth
circuit,
it
would
be
helpful
if
the
california
supreme
court
for
future
reference
explained
what
their
practice
does
in
fact
mean,
whether
it's
procedural
or
whether
it's
on
the
merits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
