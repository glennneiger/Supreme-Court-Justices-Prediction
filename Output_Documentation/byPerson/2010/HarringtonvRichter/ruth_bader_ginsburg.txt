justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
--
how
do
we
know
that
the
--
the
california
court
even
reached
that
question?
because
there
was
--
wasn't
there
a
motion
to
deny
review
as
--
as
--
wasn't
there
a
time
law
question
raised?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
did--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
what
would
the
california
supreme
court
do
if
they
all
agreed
that
this
application
should
be
denied,
but
two
of
them
think
it's
for
a
procedural
bar
--
timeliness
--
and
then
others
think
it
has
no
merit,
and
they
say
just
"denied",
but
there
is
no
majority
for
either
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though,
in
fact,
it
wasn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
is
that
possibility
--
even
though
there
is
that
possibility,
we
should
assume
it
was
on
the
merits.
what
about
--
i
mean,
you
said
this
was
3
decades,
but
we
are
told
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
this
pattern
of
saying
merits
when
it's
on
the
merits,
giving
a
citation,
if
it's
a
procedural
bar
to
the
--
a
procedural
fault,
and
when
it
says
simply
"denied",
that's
most
likely
that
they
couldn't
all
agree
on
the
reason.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
what
they
would
say
if,
in
fact,
they
were
divided,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if,
in
fact,
the
court
was
divided.
all
agree
that
the
petition
should
be
denied,
but
there
is
no
majority
for
any
particular
reason,
merits
or
procedure.
they
--
they
would
say
"petition
denied",
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
colombo,
you
--
you
say
in
any
event,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
whether
there
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
even
assuming
there
was,
there
was
--
there
would
be
no
prejudice
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
could
you
just
summarize
why
you
say
there
would
be
no
prejudice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
--
the
pool
of
blood?
there
was
one
expert
affidavit
that
said
something
about
that
johnson,
standing
up,
could
not
have
produced
that
amount
of
blood.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
--
on
the
no
prejudice
issue,
are
you
relying
just
on
what
happened
--
what
was
found
at
the
scene
of
the
crime?
i
mean,
you
said
it's
implausible
that
klein
would
have
been
moved
with
no
trail
of
blood
at
all,
so
you
say,
therefore,
no
prejudice.
any
--
anything
else
that
goes
into
your
no
prejudice
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
point
was
that
there
was
no
trail
from
the
bed.
i
mean,
the
theory
was
that
klein
was
removed
from
the
bed
to
the
couch.
and
i
thought
that
the
point
that
the
--
that
counsel
for
the
state
emphasized
was,
does
the
--
if
someone
were
moved
from
the
bed,
taken
to
the
living
room
couch,
you
would
have
expected
to
see
a
trail
of
blood
from
the
bed.
and
there
wasn't
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gardner,
what
about
the
argument
that
all
this
is
beside
the
point
because
the
argument
for
prejudice
is
so
weak,
given
all
the
other
evidence
that
mr.
colombo
referred
to?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
do
with
the
ammunition
back
at
richter's
home,
that
the
--
the
gun
safe
is
found
there
and
the
unlikely
story
about
them
going
--
having
the
zeal
to
clean
up
their
workplace
and
then
coming
back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
your
answer
to
the
--
to
--
to
the
representation
that
in
re
robbins
settled
that
when
the
california
supreme
court
says
just
denied,
it's
on
the
merits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
this
confusion,
your
version,
your
colleagues
version,
the
district
court
denied
relief,
did
you
ask
the
district
court,
please
certify
this
question
of
what
a
silent
denial
means,
certify
it
to
california
supreme
court
so
we
will
have
once
and
for
all
an
answer
of
what
a
silent
denial
means?
