mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
california
supreme
court's
denial
of
respondent's
ineffective
counsel
claim
was
entitled
to
the
deferential
review
for
reasonableness
prescribed
by
28
u.s.c.
section
2254(d).
by
its
plain
terms,
nothing
in
2254(d)
requires
a
state
court
to
render
a
reasoned
or
explained
decision,
nor
is
there
anything
in
section
2254(d)
that
would
treat
strickland
claims
differently
from
any
other
federal
constitutional
claim.
here,
the
ninth
circuit
failed
to
give
the
state
court
decision
the
proper
deference
--
indeed,
double
deference
--
it
was
owed.
rather
than
applying
this
court
's
proper
--
excuse
me
--
clearly
established
strickland
standard,
the
court
of
appeals
employed
its
own
eccentric
rule
that
essentially
requires
counsel
to
always
consult
with
and
present
expert
testimony
in
every
case
in
which
the
prosecution--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--there
was
a
procedural
bar
that
was
argued
in
the
informal
opposition
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
had
been
requested
by
the
california
supreme
court.
it
did
not
invoke
that
bar
as
a
basis
for
denying
relief.
under
well-established--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--yes.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes.
in
fact,
that
is
a
well-settled
and
long-established
practice,
local
practice,
that
is
well-understood
by
not
only
the
litigants,
but
the
state
and
federal
courts
of
the
ninth
circuit,
dating
back
to
the
ninth
circuit's
1974
decision
in
harris
v.
superior
court.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
the
state's
formulation
is
that
the
silent
or
so-called
summary
denial
is
on
the
merits,
unless
the
state
court
indicates
otherwise
in--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--yes.
and
that
rule,
again,
has
been--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--again,
because
it
has
certainly
been
well-understood
for
at
least
3-and-a-half
decades
that
when
the
california
supreme
court
renders
a
so-called
silent
denial,
that
it
is
on
the
merits
unless
the
court
ordered--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--that
would
be
in
re
robbins,
in
which--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--which
is
discussed
in
our
brief,
as
well
as
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
i'm
sorry?
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
there
really
is
no
substantive--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--i
would
submit
that
there
is
no
substantive
distinction
between
an
order
that
simply
reflects
denied
versus
one
that
reflects
denied
on
the
merits.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
well,
i
would
submit
that
there
could
be
any
number
of
reasons,
and
not
the
least
of
which
this
court
addressed
itself
in
carey
v.
saffold,
just
a
couple
of
terms
ago.
as
the
court
recognized,
that
sometimes
the
state
court
may
choose
to
include
the
phrase
"on
the
merits"
to
give
a
reviewing
court
an
alternative
basis
for
understanding
why
relief
was
denied,
or
to
let,
for
example,
a
pro
se
petitioner,
who
are
typically
the
ones
that
present
petitions
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
supreme
court,
know
that
their
case
wasn't
denied
because
of
some
mere
procedural
technicality,
but
because
the
claim
itself
was
substantively
meritless.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
no.
our
argument
is
that
it's
a
long-settled,
established
question
and
local
practice
that
when
the
california
supreme
court
renders
a
--
a
silent
denial,
simply
says
"petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
denied.
"
it
is
understood
by
the
court's
litigants,
has
been
well-established
over
3-and-a-half
decades:
that
is
a
merits
decision--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--in
--
in
that
instance,
then
the
claim
would
be
presumed
--
assuming
that
the
court's
order
simply
reflects
"petition
denied",
again,
it
is
well
understood
that
that
would
be
a
denial
on
the
merits--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--well,
we
can't
know
that.
in
fact,
it
would
be
purely
speculative
to
suggest
that
that's
what
the
courts
have
done--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--well,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
suggestion,
that
because
it
simply
says
"denied"
without
including
the
phrase
"on
the
merits"
that
it's
not
a
merits
determination.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
i'm
sorry.
what?
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes,
if
it's
--
if
it's
a
straight
silent
denial
and
the
--
the
court
doesn't
invoke
either
a
procedural
bar
to
deny
relief
or
forego
the
procedural
bar
and
find
the
claims
are
substantive
meritless
in
any
event.
what
i
submit
that
the
silent
denial
simply
means
is
that
the
court
didn't
agree
that
there
was
a
basis
for
invoking
a
procedural
bar.
the
claims
were
meritless
and
it
simply
orders
the
petition
denied,
which
is,
again,
well-understood.
it's
a
well-established
practice
in
the
state
and
federal
courts
in
california
that
those
silent
denials
are
merit
determinations,
which
are
entitled,
then,
as
to
deference
under
the
statute.
even
the
ninth
circuit,
in
the
en
banc
decision
in
this
case,
recognized
that
the
california
supreme
court's
silent
denial
was
a
merits
determination
which
it
then
had
to
review.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes.
and
when
the
court
does
that,
it
will
reflect
such
in
its
orders.
that's
discussed
in
footnote
34
in
the
robbins
case,
which
we
discuss
in
our
brief
in
this
court.
the
court
says
when
it's
going
to
invoke
as
a
basis
for
denying
relief
on
a
federal
claim,
it
will
indicate
that
in
its
order,
if
it's
relying
on
a
separate
state
procedural
default.
for
example,
if
it's
a
successive
petition
of
the
claimant's
previously
raised
on
direct
appeal
or--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--yes.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
because
i
haven't
researched
to
find
out
whether
or
not
in
any
of
those
cases,
like
in
this
case,
the
california
supreme
court
directed
the
attorney
general
to
file
an
informal
opposition
or
some
other
pleading
that
would
have
addressed
that
question.
without
knowing
whether
or
not
there
was
briefing
on
this
--
those
particular
cases,
and
there
is
no
suggestion
in
respondent's
brief
that
that
was
done,
i
couldn't
--
i
couldn't
guess
on
that.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
a
timeliness
bar,
among
others.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
that
the
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
could
and
should
have
been
discovered
at
an
earlier
time
than
when
it
was
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court
under
california's
timeliness
rule,
which
would
require
that
counsel
present
the
claim
of,
in
this
case,
ineffective
assistance
upon
learning
of
the
factual
basis
to
support
such
a
claim.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes.
and
that's
basically
the
clark
case
that's
also
discussed
in
our--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--yes,
because
i
would
submit
that
when
the
state
argued
that
the
claim
was
procedurally
barred
by
reason
of
untimeliness
and
the
state
court
did
not
invoke
that
as
a
bar
to
relief,
it
necessarily
concluded
that
the
claims
were
unmeritorious,
because
they
otherwise
could
have
been
barred
by
a
procedural
bar,
but
they--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--that's--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--if
i
said
that,
then
i
misspoke.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
court's
question.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
if
the
court
invokes
as
a
basis
for
denying
a
federal
claim
a
state
procedural
bar,
it
will
reflect
that
in
its
order.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
that's
correct,
assuming
that
the
federal
courts
agreed
that
the--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
not
in
the
federal
court,
no.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes.
i
would
submit
that--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
we
never
invoked
the
procedural
bar
in
the
federal
court
insofar
as
the
presentation
of
these
particular
claims.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
i
would
be
pleased
to
discuss
that
with
the
court.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
and
i
think
it's
crystal
clear:
first
of
all,
the
ninth
circuit's
grossly
overbroad
explication
of
a
so-called
strickland
standard
that
would
require
counsel
in
every
case
in
which
the
prosecution
presents--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
no.
they
didn't
say
that.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
that
is
--
that
certainly
is
one
reading
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
i
submit
that
the
more
correct
reading,
so
to
speak,
would
be
if
the
court
looks
at
the
language
that
the
ninth
circuit
uses
in
the
--
in
discussing
this
standard,
they
essentially
say
that
since
counsel
should
have
reasonably
expected
the
prosecution
was
going
to
present
this
forensic
evidence,
he
should
have
not
only
investigated
it,
he
should
have
consulted
with
experts.
he
should
have
presented
them.
and--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--no,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
let
me
start
by
saying
this:
first
of
all,
we
can't
know
and
no
one
can
ever
know
that
klein's,
or
johnson's
blood,
for
that
matter,
was
in
this
blood
pool
that
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--yes.
and
the
reason
why
i
say
that
is
because
it's
important
to
remember
that
--
the
critical
forensic
evidence
in
this
case,
that
the
jury--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--in
response
to
your--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--i
suppose
accepting
the
court's
hypothetical
as
stated,
that
counsel
was
aware
of
and
failed
to
consult
with
an
expert
knowing
that
that
testimony
would
be
presented,
could
be
deemed
deficient
performance.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
--
as
this
court
has
described
in
the
strickland
case
itself,
we
have
to
view
from
counsel's
perspective
at
that
time.
what
did
he
know?
what
could
he
have
reasonably
expected
the
prosecution's
evidence
to
be?
how
is
he
going
to
meet
that
evidence?
what
tactical
or
strategic
choices--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--no,
i
would
submit
that
it
certainly
could
be
deficient
performance
if
counsel
fails
to
investigate
readily
available
evidence
that
could
lead
to
exculpatory
evidence
in
support
of
his
client's
defense.
that's
the
hypothetical,
i
believe,
that
her
honor
asked
a
moment
ago.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
again,
i
think
it
would
be
--
it's
going
to
be
fact-specific
depending
upon
the
kind
of
case.
it
may
well
be
in
a
given
case
that
forensic
testimony
would
not
be
controverted,
would
not
be
disputed.
it
wouldn't
be
relevant,
necessarily,
to
the
defense.
let's
say,
for
example,
that
there
was
no
dispute,
that
the
person
who
committed
the
offense
left
dna
evidence
at
the
crime
scene
and
it's
clear
that
the
dna
evidence
suggests
that
the
perpetrator
was
the
defendant.
then
the
court
--
then
the
defense
attorney
isn't
going
to
profit
by
consulting
an
expert
to
dispute
an
indisputable
issue.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
it
is.
and
i
think
that
in
many
instances
that
would
--
that
would
inform
a
defense
attorney's
strategic
choices
as
to
how
to
present
the
defense
in
a
given
case.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
that's
correct.
yes.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
expert
declarations
that
were
proffered
by
respondent
in
support
of
his
habeas
petition
really
don't
challenge
the
testimony
that
was
presented
in
the
state
trial
by
the
state's
experts,
specifically
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
murder
victim
could
have
been
moved
from,
supposedly,
the
area
outside
the
bedroom
door
onto
the
couch.
the
testimony
at
trial
suggested
that
that
distance
was
somewhere
between
about
20
and
25
feet.
there
was
no
evidence
at
the
crime
scene
that
suggested
the
victim
had
moved
from
the
point
where
he
was
shot
with
a
fatal
gunshot
wound.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
i
think
the
actual
expert
declaration
suggested
that
the
prosecution's
theory,
as
the
expert
described
it,
could
be
eliminated,
because
johnson
could
not
have
bled
into
the
blood
pool
sufficient
to
have
formed
it
by
merely
standing
and
waiting
for
the
police
to
arrive.
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
the
distinction
between
the
prosecutor's
theory
which
he
propounded
in
his
closing
argument
versus
the
evidence
that
the
jury
actually
heard
at
trial
from
the
state's
own
blood
spatter
expert
that
suggested
in
order
for
--
for
klein
to
have
been
moved
from
the
point
where
the
blood
pool
had
formed
onto
the
couch
where
his
body
was
discovered
by
the
police,
there
would
have
been
some
trail
or
some
indicia,
some
evidence
that
would
have
suggested
that
he
had
to
have
been
moved
from
that
point.
and
the
more
important
question,
i
suppose,
would
be,
as
the
dissenting
opinion
pointed
out
in
this
case:
why
would
the
victim
have
been
moved
if
he
had
been
shot
at
that
location?
why
would
he
have
been
moved
onto
the
couch?
it
certainly
makes
no
sense
for
another
victim,
who's
already
shot,
who
is
intoxicated,
who
is
wounded
and
moving
around
in
the
house,
why
would
he
have
wanted
to
move
the
victim
of
the
gunshot
wound
to
the
head
from
point
a
to
point
b?
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
and
there
has
never
been
anything
in
any
of
respondent's
experts'
declarations
that
suggests
a
rational
explanation
for
how
or
why
that
could
have
happened.
in
that
case--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--yes.
i
think
for
all
of
the
reasons
that
are
discussed
in
the
dissenting
opinion
pages
193a
to
194a
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
--
excuse
me,
of
the
appendix.
as
the
dissenting
opinion
points
out,
it
certainly
was
--
there's
no
evidence
in
the
various
experts'
declarations
that
suggests,
first
of
all,
why
the
jury
would
have
believed
respondent's
trial
testimony
that
after
having
essentially
partied
with
the
two
victims
for
several
hours
the
night
before,
they
suddenly
leave,
go
back
to
their
place
of
employment,
come
back
two
hours
later
to
return
property
and
a
firearm
to
another
occupant
of
the
house
that
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
was
actually
there;
then
they
are
suddenly
surprised
by
these
two
victims;
that
there
--
there
is
a
spontaneous
gunfight
that
ensues
involving
a
firearm
that's
never
found,
that's
never
attributed
to
either
of
the
two
victims
in
the
house,
that
could
have
only
been
attributable
to
the
respondent
himself?
so
the
jury
had
all
of
that
evidence
to
consider,
and
balance
that
against
these
--
as
i,
again,
described
them
--
inconclusive
and
speculative
expert
opinions
that
are
proffered
in
support
of
respondent's
habeas
petition.
the
jury
could
not
have
been
persuaded
to
find
the
defendant
not
guilty,
even
had
that
evidence
been
introduced.
so
necessarily,
petitioner
could
--
respondent
could
not
have
been
prejudiced
by
the
failure
to
introduce
that
evidence,
assuming
that
that
evidence
was,
in
fact,
available
and
could
have
been
presented
in
this
case
at
the
time
of
respondent's
trial.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes.
in
fact,
the
other
thing
that
really
tied
the
respondent
into
this
crime
was
that
there
was
an
expended
casing
at
the
crime
scene
that
matched
perfectly
with
a
loaded
firearm
magazine
with
the
exact
same
kind
of
bullets
and
a
box
full
of
the
same
exact
bullets
in
the
respondent's
house
when
the
officer
served
a
search
warrant,
along
with
the
stolen
gun
safe
and
some
evidence
that
there
was
marijuana
there,
which
the
victim
--
the
surviving
victim
was
admitted
to
be
a
marijuana
dealer.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes.
under
california
discovery
rules,
the
prosecution
would
have
to
disclose
to
the
defense
any
evidence
it
intends
to
introduce,
either
by
way
of
lay
testimony
or
expert
testimony,
before
the
trial
commences.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
the
defendant
would
have
to
disclose
any
witnesses
that
he
or
she
intends
to
introduce
at
trial,
including
expert
testimony
and
any
reports
supporting
such
expert.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
thank
you.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
thank
you.
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
this
is
an
aedpa
case.
it
has
always
been
an
aedpa
case.
we've
never
asserted
this
case
was
not
an
aedpa
case.
the
court
has
had
a
very
spirited
discussion
this
morning
essentially
conducting
a
de
novo
strickland
review
of
the
claims
that
are
presented
in
the
district
court
in
this
case.
it's
important
to
remember
we
have
to
view
as
this
court
described
in
woodford
v.
visciotti,
a
strickland
claim
through
the
lens
of
the
applicants
burden
to
demonstrate
that
the
state
court's
resolution
of
the
strickland
claim
on
the
fact
of
his
case
was
objectively
unreasonable.
whether
this
court
were
to
choose
to
find
that
the
california
supreme
court's
determination
if
it
were
reviewed
de
novo
was
improper
is
different
from
determining
whether
or
not
the
state
court
could
have
reasonably
conclude
on
the
factual
record
presented
to
it,
but
the
applicant's
claim
failed
to
show
a
basis
for
relief.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
when
respondent's
counsel
filed
his
brief
in
opposition
in
this
court.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
well,
i
would
submit
that
if
there
was
a
dispute
about
the
applicability
of
the
deference
to
the
california
supreme
court,
it
should
have
been
raised
much
earlier
than
when
we
got
to
this
court.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
no,
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
respondent's
counsel
was
avoiding
that.
i
am
suggesting
that
if
this
was
a
legitimately
disputed
question
it
could
have
been
addressed
much
earlier.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
no,
it
was
not
raised
in
the
opposition
to
cert.
it
was
not
presented
until
the
merits
brief--
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
--yes.
now
i
wanted,
if
i
may,
just
touch
a
couple
of
points
real
quickly.
now
on
page
23
in
footnote,
i
believe
it's
6
of
our
reply
brief,
there
is
a
discussion
about
what
the
detective's
testimony
was
in
regard
to
this
blood
spatter
near
the
couch
where
the
murder
victim's
body
was
found.
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
respondent's
counsel
talked
about
whether
or
not
this
spatter
would
have
consistent
with
having
been
shot
on
the
couch
if
there
were
blood
spatter
behind
the
armrest.
what
the
detective
testified
to
and
what
is
described
in
our
brief
is
the
detective
said
because
this
was
not
a
through
and
through
exit
wound
--
that
is,
the
bullet
lodged
in
the
victim's
head
--
that
the
spatter
would
have
been
what
he
described
as
back
spatter,
meaning
the
blood
would
have
flown
out
from
the
victim's
head
outward,
and
that
was
consistent
with
what
the
evidence
was
at
the
crime
scene
that
the
detective
observed
when
he
was
there
after
the
murder
was
committed.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
the
detective
described
those
as
essentially
insignificant;
they
didn't
reflect
anything
other
than
someone
was
moving
around
in
the
house,
which
was
consistent
with
what
the
crime
scene
investigators
had
discovered
when
they
first
responded
to
the
911
call
from
the
--
mr.
johnson
to
the
police.
mr.
harry
joseph
colombo
i
would
submit
that
that
would
be
helpful
but
unnecessary.
