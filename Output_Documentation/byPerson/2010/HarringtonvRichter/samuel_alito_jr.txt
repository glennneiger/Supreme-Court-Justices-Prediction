justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you
looked
back
at
a
sample
of
the
cases
in
which
they
have
simply
said
"denied",
would
we
find
cases
in
which
no
procedural
bar
was
raised
by
the
state?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
didn't
raise
--
you
haven't
argued
that
it's
procedurally
barred.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you
may
have
waived
that.
on
the
other
hand,
your
opponent
is,
like
--
i
gather,
until
they
got
here,
never
argued
that
it
was
based
on
anything
other
than
the
merits.
so
they
might
have
waived
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
everything
might
be
waived
here.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
there
additional
physical
evidence
found
not
at
the
scene?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
california
procedure?
is
what
happened
here
unusual?
is
there
--
doesn't
--
does
the
prosecution
have
an
obligation
to
provide
notice
before
trial
of
its
intention
to
call
expert
witnesses?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
the
defendant
requests
that,
what
is
the
defendant's
reciprocal
obligation,
if
any?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
is
your
theory
about
why
he
--
why
johnson
would
have
a
motive
to
go
through
this
exertion?
he's
--
he
is
wounded,
and
let's
say
there
really
was
a
gun
--
a
gun
fight,
and
klein
fell
someplace
else.
johnson
wants
to
make
it
seem
like
klein
was
--
that
there
wasn't
any
gun
fight.
why
--
why
is
it
so
valuable
to
him
to
move
klein's
body
from
the
location
where
you
think
he
fell
to
the
couch?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
he
could
have
--
if
he's
going
to
make
up
a
story,
he
could
have
made
up
a
story
that
klein
jumped
up
and
he
was
shot
without
having
engaged
in
any
firing
himself
and
he
fell
wherever
he
fell.
putting
him
on
the
couch
doesn't
seem
to
--
unless
i
am
missing
something
and
you
should
explain
it
--
doesn't
seem
to
aid
this
purportedly
false
story
very
much.
and
if
you
weigh
whatever
benefit
there
is
from
that
against
the
exertion
of
moving
this
guy,
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
but
maybe
there's
something
there
that's
not
apparent.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
he
had
not
received
any
notice
from
the
state
that
they
were
going
to
call
any
experts,
so
why
wasn't
it
reasonable
for
him
to
assume
they
are
not
going
to
call
any
experts?
they
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
pull
experts
out
of
their
pocket
in
the
midst
of
the
trial
and
the
judge
isn't
going
to
allow
them
to
do
that
without
providing
a
--
without
granting
a
recess.
what
seems
to
have
happened
here
seems
pretty
unusual.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
under
your
example
then,
isn't
there
a
majority
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
procedural
default,
but
disagreement
as
to
the
particular
procedural
default?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
just
a
binary
choice
between
procedural
default
and
merits,
isn't
there
--
and
everybody
agrees
it
should
be
denied
and
there
is
going
to
be
a
majority
for
one
or
the
other,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
more
than
one
possible
procedural
problem
here,
i
thought
it
was
just
timeliness?
