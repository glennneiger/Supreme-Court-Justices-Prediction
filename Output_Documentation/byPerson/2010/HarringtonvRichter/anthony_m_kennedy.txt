justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course
it
said
--
it
just
said
denied
on
--
on
the
merits.
and
it's
still
not
clear
to
me.
how
did
this
--
pardon
me.
it
just
said
"denied"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
still
not
clear
to
me
how
to
distinguish
that,
between
denied,
deny
--
do
we
say
when
there's
a
one-line
order,
as
in
this
case,
where
it
says
simply
"denied",
that
it
is
presumptively
on
the
merits?
i
mean,
how
--
how
do
we
interpret
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
it
is
presumptively
on
the
merits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
don't
--
i
mean,
is
that
the
way
it's
stated?
don't
let
me
use
my
formulation.
what's
--
what's
the
state's
formulation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
i
am
on
the
california
court
and
i
have
two
choices
--
one
is
to
say
denied,
no
explanation,
this
case;
the
other
is
to
say
denied
on
the
merits
--
if
i
have
those
two
options,
then
why
are
they
both
on
the
merits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is
the
leading
california
authority
on
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
robbins
case.
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
it
the
reality
that
sometimes
the
defense
doesn't
want
to
have
an
expert,
because
the
expert
may
turn
up
findings
that
are
adverse
for
him
and
it's
better
for
the
defense
counsel
to
leave
things
murky
and
argue
to
the
jury
that
the
state
didn't
produce
the
evidence,
either?
that's
a
perfectly
legitimate
strategy,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
johnson
had
given
so
many
inconsistent
statements
at
the
outset
that
he
was
a
weak
prosecution
witness.
it
seems
to
me
the
defense
could
have
pinned
a
great
deal
of
hope
on
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
--
if
the
expert
says
that
the
pool
of
blood
all
belonged
to
--
i
guess
it's
johnson,
i
certainly
think
ethically
that
you
could
not
argue
otherwise
to
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so,
that's
a
reason
why
defense
counsel,
in
this
case
the
chief
justice
puts
in
many
cases,
prefers
not
to
have
experts,
just
so
they
can
punch
holes
in
the
state's
case.
that's
a
--
that's
a
legitimate
--
and
this
counsel
was
very
--
an
adept
cross
examiner.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
court
today
decides
two
cases
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
ninth
circuit
granted
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
to
persons
convicted
under
state
law.
in
both
cases,
we
find
the
court
of
appeals
committed
error.
the
first
of
this
is
harrington
versus
richter,
number
09-587.
the
respondent
was
richter,
claims
he
received
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
at
trial
because
his
attorney
did
not
consult
experts
in
preparation
for
the
trial
or
call
experts
to
the
stand
during
the
trial.
the
experts
that
richter
now
says
counsel
should
have
consulted
where
experts
in
blood
evidence.
in
order
to
reach
the
legal
issues,
the
opinion
recites
the
details
of
the
crime
at
some
length,
just
a
brief
account
is
necessary
here.
the
crime
occurred
among
four
persons
and
they
all
knew
each
other.
the
prosecution
maintained
that
--
that
there
were
two
victims
and
two
assailants
and
one
of
the
assailants
was
--
was
richter.
the
prosecution
said
richter
and
the
accomplice
returned
to
the
house
where
the
four
men
had
all
been
present
earlier
in
the
evening
and
richter
and
his
accomplice
shot
the
other
two.one
survived,
the
other
died.
richter
wanted
the
jury
to
believe
that
one
of
the
victims
had
fired
at
his
companion
and
that
the
companion
had
fired
back
in
self-defense
and
that
the
deceased
was
killed
in
the
crossfire.
and
to
support
his
version
of
the
events,
richter
suggested
that
after
he
and
his
friend
left
the
scene
of
the
shootings,
the
victim
who
survived
moved
the
other
victim's
body
to
another
room.
and
according
to
richter,
this
was
the
theory
that
the
defense
counsel
should
have
supported,
by
consulting
and
offering
testimony
from
experts,
blood
experts
in
serology
and
blood
spatter
patterns
and
--
and
pathology.
now,
the
jury
did
not
hear
any
defense
experts
on
blood
nor
did
richter's
counsel
consult
blood
experts
in
preparation
for
the
trial.
the
jury
did
not
accept
the
self-defense
theory.
they
convicted
richter
of
first
degree
murder,
he
receives
a
life
sentence.
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals,
in
agreement
with
the
state
courts
and
the
federal
district
court,
denied
relief
on
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
sitting
en
banc,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
the
habeas
relief
be
granted
and
we
now
reverse.
the
controlling
case
on
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
which
contains
the
standards
that
we
apply
here
today
after
reaching
the
procedural
points,
is
strickland
versus
washington.
but
in
considering
whether
to
order
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
to
vacate
a
state
conviction,
after
the
state
courts
have
denied
relief,
federal
courts
are
constrained
by
the
limitation
in
a
federal
statute
and
that
statute
is
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act,
commonly
known
as
aedpa
and
the
relevant
provision
is
28
u.s.c.
section
2254(d).
that
statute
limits
federal
habeas
relief
for
any
claim
presented
in
the
federal
habeas
petition
that
was
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
state
court.
in
rejecting
richter's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
the
state
court,
the
supreme
court
of
california,
issued
a
one
line
order.
and
the
first
question
addressed
in
the
opinion
is
whether
the
california
supreme
court
order
was
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
richter's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
and
we
hope
that
it
was.
the
text
of
the
statute
requires
only
a
state
court
adjudication
on
the
merits,
that's
the
statutory
phrase,
it
had
to
be
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
but
it
doesn't
require
an
--
an
opinion.
on
the
basic
issues
in
the
case,
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
accord
the
deference
required
by
aedpa
and
by
strickland.
as
a
condition
for
obtaining
habeas
corpus
from
a
federal
court,
aedpa
requires
a
state
prisoner
to
show
that
the
state's
ruling
on
the
claim
being
presented
in
federal
court
was
so
lacking
in
justification,
that
there
was
an
error
well
understood
and
comprehended
in
existing
law
beyond
any
possibility
for
fair-minded
disagreement.
now,
this
standard
was
meant
to
be
difficult
to
meet.
section
2254
stops
short
of
imposing
a
complete
bar
on
federal
court
relitigation
of
claims
already
rejected
in
state
proceedings.
and
it
preserves
the
authority
to
issue
the
writ
in
cases
where
there
is
no
possibility,
fair-minded
jurors
--
jurist
could
disagree
with
the
state
court's
decision
as
conflicting
with
this
court's
precedence.
but
it
goes
no
further.
and
the
reason
for
this
approach
--
the
reasons
for
this
approach
are
familiar.
a
federal
habeas
review
frustrates
state
eff
--
efforts
to
punish
offenders
and
it
undermines
state
efforts
to
honor
constitutional
rights
and
disturbs
society's
interest
in
repose.
federal
habeas
corpus
intrudes
on
state
sovereignty
to
a
degree
matched
by
few
exercises
of
federal
judicial
authority.
so,
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
counsels'
action
satisfies
strickland's
standards.
section
2254(d)
applies
so
the
question
is
whether
there
is
any
reasonable
argument
that
counsel
satisfy
that
standards.
if
the
court
of
appeals
gave
section
2254
no
operation
or
function
in
its
reasoning,
its
analysis
--
illustrates
a
lack
of
deference
to
the
state
court's
determination.
this
was
contrary
to
the
purpose
and
mandate
of
aedpa
and
to
the
now
well-settled
meaning
and
function
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
system.
even
apart
from
the
limitations
imposed
by
aedpa,
the
court
of
appeals
misapplied
strickland.
relief
is
warranted
under
strickland
only
if
an
attorney
made
errors
so
serious
that
counsel
was
not
functioning
as
the
counsel
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment.
the
question
strickland
asked
is
whether
an
attorney's
performance
amounted
to
incompetence
under
prevailing
professional
norms,
not
whether
it
deviated
from
best
practices
or
most
common
custom.
and
there
is
a
strong
presumption
that
counsel's
representation
was
within
the
range
of
reasonable
professional
assistance.
here,
counsel
could
decide
not
to
consult
with
blood
experts
for
a
number
of
reasons.
there
are
many
differences
between
the
prosecution
and
defense
version
of
the
shootings.
reliance
on
the
harsh
light
of
hindsight
to
second-guess
trial
proceedings
is
precisely
what
strickland
and
aedpa
forbid.even
if
it
had
been
apparent
that
blood
evidence
could've
supported
the
defense,
a
reasonable
attorney
could
choose
not
to
use
it.
to
support
a
defense
argument,
the
prosecution
has
not
proved
its
case.
it
is
sometimes
better
for
the
defense
to
try
to
cast
pervasive
suspicion
of
doubt
rather
than
to
try
to
prove
a
certainty
that
exonerates.
the
court
of
appeals
also
erred
in
finding
that
richter
suffered
prejudice
as
a
result
of
the
failure
to
pursue
forensic
evidence.
the
evidence
richter
says
his
counsel
was
required
to
introduce,
could
be
reconciled
with
the
considerable
evidence
that
re
--
remained
that
pointed
to
his
guilt.
there
was
ample
basis
for
the
california
supreme
court
to
think
any
possibility
of
richter
being
acquitted
was
eclipsed
by
the
other
evidence.
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
stands
as
a
safeguard
against
imprisonment
of
those
held
in
violation
of
the
law.
and
judges
must
be
vigilant
and
independent
in
reviewing
petitions
for
the
writ,
a
commitment
that
entails
substantial
judicial
resources.
but
those
resources
are
diminished
and
misspent
and
confidence
in
the
writ
and
the
law
it
vindicates
or
undermined,
if
there
is
judicial
disregard
for
the
sound
and
established
principles
that
informs
it
proper
issuance.
and
that
judicial
regard
is
inherent
and
in
the
appeals'
court
judgment
in
this
case.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
court's
opinion.justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
