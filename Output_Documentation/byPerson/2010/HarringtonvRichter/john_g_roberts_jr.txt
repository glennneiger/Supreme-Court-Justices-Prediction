chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
no.
09-587,
harrington
v.
richter.
mr.
colombo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
thing
that's
not
waived
is
the
second
question
of
the
first,
which
is
the
merits
of
the
strickland
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
this
would
be
a
good
point
for
you
to
switch
to
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
colombo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
gardner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
the
idea
is
that
johnson
drags
klein.
this
is
your
theory,
right?
because
you
are
not
suggesting
he
could
have
lifted
klein
and
walked
him
over,
are
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
really?
did
you
have
an
expert
testify
to
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
you
get
expert
testimony
about
that
or
an
expert
report
about
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
think
you
can
assume
he
could
lift
the
weight.
how
much
did
klein
weigh?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
johnson?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
and
you
say
that
he
could
have
dragged
him
from
the
pool
to
the
couch
because
there
were
drops
along
the
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what
other
expert
evidence
should
richter's
counsel
should
have
pursued
before
deciding
upon
this
course
of
action
in
this
case?
put
aside
the
blood
splatter
expert.
what
other
experts
did
he
need
to
consult.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
we
have
got
a
blood
splatter
expert,
a
ballistics
expert.
go
on.
i
thought
in
the
habeas
proceeding,
you
said
he
should
have
consulted
a
serologist
and
a
pathologist.
okay,
that's
four.
why
wouldn't
he
want
to
talk
to
an
expert
on
the
effects
of
alcohol
and
drugs
on
people's
different
perceptions
of
the
events?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
part
of
the
ineffective
assistance
was
failing
to
consult
an
expert
in
planning
his
defense
and
in
preparing
his
defense,
not
simply
responding
to
the
state's
expert
in
the
middle
of
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
i
understand
you
--
i
just
want
to
step
back
to
your
prior
answer.
you
think
what
counsel
did
here
would
have
been
effective
assistance
but
for
exactly
what
he
said
in
the
opening
statement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
mean
the
case
against
gunner
you've
just
described,
would
it
have
been
enough,
and
wouldn't
that
have
justified
counsel's
decision
to
focus
on
credibility
rather
than
expert
physical
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
--
did
the
counsel
have
to
investigate
the
other
aspects?
i
mean,
we
are
talking
--
we
are
focusing
on
the
scene
where
the
shooting
took
place.
did
he
have
to
consider
experts
with
respect
to
the
bypass,
where
they
threw
the
guns,
victor's
apartment,
the
vehicle
that
was
used?
one
thing
counsel
said
is
he
thought
about
hiring
a
tire
expert
because
of
the
vehicle.
he
has
to
look
at
the
possibility
of
expert
testimony
affecting
every
aspect
of
the
various
scenes
that
were
pertinent
in
this
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
does
--
what
happens
--
i
know
you
have
an
answer
that
that's
not
this
case,
but
what
--
what
happens
if
the
defendant
tells
his
lawyer,
look,
i
did
it,
i'm
guilty?
and
the
lawyer
decides
that
the
best
thing
to
do
is
try
to
pin
it
on
a
guy
whose
nickname
is
gunner?
[laughter]
does
--
does
--
what
else
is
the
lawyer
supposed
to
do?
he
thinks
no
matter
what
--
what
physical
evidence
is
found,
it's
got
to
cut
against
his
client
because
his
client
did
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
your
case
--
your
case
does
have
an
aedpa
issue.
perhaps
you
want
to
turn--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
that
now.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
worked.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
colombo,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
drops
between
the
blood
pool
and
the
couch?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
