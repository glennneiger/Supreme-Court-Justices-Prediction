justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that
can't
be
a
ninth
circuit
rule.
i
mean,
that
has
to
depend
upon
each
--
each
of
the
states
in
the
ninth
circuit,
no?
i
mean,
some
state
could
--
could
have
a
different
ruling,
i
assume.
you're
--
you're
telling
us,
however,
that
california
has
that
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
--
does
the
court
sometimes
deny
explicitly
on
procedural
grounds?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
saying
that
if
it's
on
both
grounds,
if
they
agreed
with
both
the
procedural
and
the
merits
ground,
they
may
well
just
--
just
deny
without
any
explanation?
but
if
they
deny
only
on
the
procedural
ground,
they
will
--
they
will
say
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
just
told
me
that
if
they
--
if
they
agreed
both
on
the
procedural
ground
and
the
merits
ground,
they
could
issue
just
--
just
a
denial
without
explanation.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
you
are
telling
me
that
--
the
opposite.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
will
always
be
in
the
order.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
do
you
think
it
makes
a
difference
whether
the
expert
would
have
helped
or
not?
i
mean,
counsel
has
to
make
that
decision
of
whether
to
call
an
expert
ex
ante,
not
ex
post.
i
mean,
you
--
we
shouldn't
evaluate
his
decision
on
the
basis
of
whether,
even
if
it's
a
1,000-to-1
long
shot,
it
turns
out
that
that
testimony
would
have
been
very
successful.
don't
we
have
to
examine
it
ex
ante
before
he
knows
what
the
result
will
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
sotomayor's
hypothetical
would
include
the
situation
where
he
doesn't
know
that
the
prosecution
is
going
to
introduce
any
expert
testimony.
he
knows
that
there
is
blood
there.
he
should
--
he
should
get
his
own
expert,
whether
or
not
the
prosecution
uses
one.
right?
i
mean,
can
it
never
be
ineffective
assistance
not
to
call
an
expert
where
--
so
long
as
the
prosecution
doesn't
have
one
on
the
other
side?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
could?
really?
is
that
your
test?
it
could,
there
is
some
remote
possibility?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
he
wipe
up
the
blood?
i
mean,
what
good
is
it
to
simply
put
him
on
the
couch
when
you
leave
a
pool
of
blood
showing
that
that's
where
he
was
shot?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
other--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
i
come
back
to
your
response
to
the
chief
justice's
about
counsel
that
knows
that
his
client
is
guilty,
and
you
say
the
aba
standards
say
that
even
when
that's
the
case,
you
have
an
obligation
to
get
an
expert
witness
to
confirm
that
the
client
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
never
adopted
the
aba
standards,
have
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
standard
seems
to
me
quite
silly.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
sure
they
often
say
they
are
innocent
when
they
are
guilty.
i'm
--
i'm
--
i'm
astounded
that
they
often
say
they
are
guilty
when
they
are
innocent.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
--
to
the
police,
perhaps,
yes,
but
to
his
own
counsel?
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any
literature
to
that
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
there
is
no
majority
for
either
ground
and
yet
you
find
in
favor
of
the
state?
how
can
that
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you
are
positing
that
the
only
time
they
do
not
say
either
procedurally
barred
or
on
the
merits
is
when
they
don't
have
a
majority
for
either
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
they
render
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
state,
then,
if
there
is
no
majority
for
either
disposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
you
lost
me.
i
thought
you
said
that
they
raised
it
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
cert?
justice
antonin
scalia
until
the
merits
briefing?
