justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
maybe
it
could
mean
having
no
reason
for
knocking
on
the
door
other
than
to
create
exigent
circumstances.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
this?
it
might
--
it
might
make
a
difference
to
me
whether
the
police
demanded
entry
prior
to
the
time
when
the
alleged
exigent
circumstances
arose.
and
the
only
testimony
on
this
point
that
i
am
aware
of
is
on
pages
22
and
23
of
the
appendix
when
police
banged
on
the
door
as
loud
as
they
could
and
announced
police,
police,
police,
and
then
detective
maynard
banged
on
the
door
and
said
this
is
the
police.
now,
is
there
any
--
anything
more
in
the
record?
any
evidence
that
they,
prior
to
the
time
when
they
heard
what
they
allegedly
heard,
they
said
open
the
door?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
starts
--
it
says
we
knew
that
there
was
possibly
something
that
was
going
to
be
destroyed
inside
the
apartment.
at
that
point
detective
maynard
--
this
is
after
they
heard
the
sounds,
after
they
claim
to
have
heard
the
sounds.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
evidence
of
that?
did
anybody
else
testify
to
what
happened?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
does
it
--
does
it
turn
on
how
loudly
they
knocked?
if
they
just
knock
on
the
door
and
say
this
is
the
police,
is
--
is
that
--
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
was
there
here
to
make
a
reasonable
person
believe
that
--
that
entry
was
imminent
and
inevitable,
if
--
if
all
that's
done
is
a
knock
on
the
door
and
they
say
police,
police,
police,
this
is
the
police?
maybe
it
turns
on
how
loudly
they
spoke
or
how
loudly
they
--
they
knocked,
is
that
the
point?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what
took
this
outside
of
the
category
of
the
ordinary
knock
and
talk?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
labels,
but
what
did
they
--
what
did
the
police
do
that
went
beyond
would
be
permitted
under
your
understanding
of
a
pure
knock
and
talk?
it's
--
it's
the
volume
of
the
--
the
knocking?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
banging,
not
knocking?
