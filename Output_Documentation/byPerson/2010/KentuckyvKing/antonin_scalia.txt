justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
just
be
somebody
going
to
the
toilet,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
have
to
suspect
that
the
reason
the
toilet
is
flushing
is
somebody
is
trying
to
get
rid
of
evidence.
and
in
order
for
that
to
be
the
case,
you
have
to
have
smelled
marijuana?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
--
what
if
the
defendants
here
had
not
flushed
the
evidence
down
but
had
answered
the
door
and
said,
"yes"?
would
the
policeman
have
been
able
to
do
anything
just
because
they
had
smelled
marijuana?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
yes,
but
they
say:
oh,
heck,
no,
you
can't
come
in;
do
you
have
a
warrant?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
basically
the
--
the
police
were
taking
advantage
of
the
stupidity
of
the
criminals,
is
that
right?
that's
terrible,
that's
not
fair,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
after
--
after
they've
heard
the
movement
inside
or
the
flushing
or
whatever,
you
can't
just
kick
it
in
because
you've
smelled
marijuana.
can
you
do
it,
because
you
--
you
knock
on
the
door
because
you
smell
marijuana,
nobody
answers,
and
you
kick
the
door
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
without
that
noise.
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
of
course
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
not?
i
mean
people
--
you
know,
when
there's
a
knock
on
--
on
the
door,
is
the
normal
human
reaction
to
walk
into
the
other
room
and
shut
the
door?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
peculiar
behavior,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
common
experience,
that
you
knock
on
a
door
and
all
you
hear
is
somebody
walking
out
of
the
room
and
shutting
a
door?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
recall
it
ever
happening
to
me,
but
maybe
--
maybe
i'm
a
likable
fellow
and
people
open
the
door.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could
say:
go
away.
they
could
do
a
lot
of
stuff.
but
walk
in
the
other
room
and
shut
the
door?
justice
antonin
scalia
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
that
they're
destroying
evidence
unless
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
there
is
contraband
inside.
i
mean,
the
--
the
hypothetical
is
an
unrealistic
one.
they
knock
on
the
door
and
somebody
moves
inside,
that
doesn't
give
them
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
different
hypothetical.
there's
a
hypothetical
in
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
knock
on
every
door
under
which
they
smell
marijuana.
justice
antonin
scalia
perfectly
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
loudly.
is
any
of
that
unlawful?
is
--
is
--
is
knocking
loudly
on
the
door
unlawful?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
--
if
it
unlawful?
is
--
is
saying
"open
up,
police",
is
that
unlawful?
justice
antonin
scalia
miss
drake,
the
problem
i
have
is
there
are
a
lot
of
constraints
on
--
on
law
enforcement,
and
the
one
thing
that
--
that
it
has
going
for
it
is
that
criminals
are
stupid.
[laughter]
and
we
had
a
case
some
years
ago
in
which
the
issue
was
whether
the
washington
police
could
enter
buses
arriving
from
--
from
the
south
and
--
and
randomly
ask
passengers,
do
you
mind
if
we
look
in
your
luggage?
and
the
--
the
--
the
mules
who
were
carrying
marijuana
were
stupid
enough
to
say:
oh,
of
course,
just
to
show
that
they
had
nothing
to
fear.
and
an
enormous
number
of
arrests
were
--
were
effected
in
that
fashion.
we
didn't
say
that's
not
fair
because
you're
taking
advantage
of
the
--
of
the
ignorance
of
these
--
these
poor
criminals.
we
said
that's
perfectly
okay.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
same
thing
is
going
on
here.
these
people
could
have
answered
the
door.
there's
a
policeman
knocking
on
the
door.
all
he's
saying
is
open
the
door,
open
the
door,
say,
yes,
what
do
you
want?
say,
you
know,
blah,
blah,
blah.
they
say,
well,
get
a
warrant.
shut
the
door.
they
didn't
do
that.
but
everything
done
was
perfectly
lawful.
it's
unfair
to
the
criminal?
is
that
--
is
that
the
problem?
i
really
don't
understand
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
--
you
--
you
--
you
might
have
considerable
support
on
the
court
for
the
proposition
that
if
the
exigent
circumstance
is
created
by
unlawful
activity
by
the
police,
which
would
include
conveying
the
impression
that
they
are
about
to
kick
the
door
in,
then
--
then
you
have
a
different
case.
but
--
but
i
thought
the
case
we
had
before
us
is
what
if
the
police
officers
are
behaving
perfectly
lawfully
and
they're
not
threatening
to
kick
down
the
door,
and
they
smelled
the
marijuana
and
then
they
hear
the
motion
inside,
does
that
justify
their
going
in?
and
that's
what
i
thought
we
took
the
case
for,
and
that's
a
different
question.
you're
trying
to
--
you're
trying
to
make
the
police
officers'
actions
unlawful,
and
i
will
stipulate
that
if
their
actions
were
unlawful
you
have
a
different
case,
and
probably
the
evidence
would
have
to
be
suppressed,
but
i
didn't
think
we
were
here
to
decide
that,
whether
they
knocked
too
loud,
whether
they
threatened
to
kick
in
the
door.
the
opinion
below
says
if
they
created
the
exigent
circumstances
whether
they
did
so
lawfully
or
unlawfully,
they
cannot
go
in
--
and
that's,
that's
the
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
decision
below,
though.
the
court
below
didn't
say
these
police
officers
were
behaving
as
though
they
had
a
warrant
and
were
about
to
kick
in
the
door.
the
opinion
below
just
said,
yes,
there
were
exigent
circumstances,
but
they
were
the
result
of
the
police
knocking
on
the
door
and
saying
we're
the
police.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
doubt
that
it's
unlawful
for
a
police
officer
to
threaten
to
burst
into
a
home?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
do
you
need
unreasonable?
if,
indeed,
there
--
there
was
a
threat
of
imminent
entry,
we're
going
to
bust
down
the
--
if
that
was
the
threat,
then
it's
unlawful,
surely.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
is
that
as
reasonable
as
the
test
is,
it's
not
the
test
that
was
used
by
the
court
below,
and
you
want
us
to
affirm
the
decision
below,
which
simply
said
if
the
exigent
circumstances
are
--
are
the
consequence
of
the
police
action,
whatever
the
police
action
was
--
lawful,
reasonable,
whatever
--
the
evidence
has
to
be
excluded.
now,
how
can
we
affirm
that
decision
as
you
want
us
to
do,
even
--
even
applying
your
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
technically
be
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
would
it,
if
the
police
gave
the
impression
that
they
had
a
warrant
and
were
about
to
kick
in
the
door?
is
that
a
fourth
amendment
violation
in
and
of
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
--
the
--
the
unlawfulness
test
would
not
prevent
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
not?
oh.
maybe
we
have
to
come
up
with
an
unreasonable
test,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it'd
be
okay
for
officers
to
do
that?
pretend
they
have
a
warrant?
open
the
door
or
we'll
kick
it
in.
that's
perfectly
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
why,
you
say
that
what
they've
done
is
not
lawful.
why
would
it
be
suppressed?
