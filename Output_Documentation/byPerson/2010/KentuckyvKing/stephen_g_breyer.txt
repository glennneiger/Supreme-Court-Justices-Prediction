g.
breyer
what
are
the
objections
to
adding
in
the
alternative,
"or
in
bad
faith"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
objectively?
i
mean,
what
we're
trying
to
rule
out
is
they
--
they
hitch
--
they
get
this
bright
idea,
the
police:
we'll
go
knock
on
every
door.
so
what
about
that,
objectively
determined
bad
faith.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
point
is
a
solely
unlawfulness
test
would
allow
the
police
to
get
into
the
habit
of
just
knocking
at
every
door,
but
if
you
say
that
also,
it
has
to
survive
a
bad
faith
test,
where
bad
faith
is
objectively,
not
subjectively,
determined,
then
you
will
rule
out
the
possibility
of
the
police
hatching
--
which
i
don't
know
if
they
would,
but
hatching
such
a
plan.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
are
circuits
who
have
adopted
a
bad
faith
test
in
the
alternative
with
other
things
than
the
word
"unlawful".
the
second
circuit
uses
only
the
word
"unlawful",
and
i
thought
we
took
this
case
to
iron
out
that
discrepancy.
and
if
we
did,
i
would
like
to
know
your
objection
to
ironing
it
out
by
taking
the
second
circuit
test
but
adding
on
an
objectively
determined
bad
faith
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
police
say,
oh,
i
don't
want
to
get
a
warrant.
it's
such
a
bore.
we
have
other
things
to
do.
i
have
a
great
idea;
let's
knock
at
the
door,
and
then
as
soon
as
he
starts
moving
around,
i
know
what
he's
going
to
the
--
going
into
the
bathroom
means,
and
we'll
hear
that,
and
we'll
be
able
to
get
in.
hey,
great
idea.
okay.
now
suppose
that's
the
record.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
mean
to
add:
and
in
fact,
there's
probable
cause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
addition,
he
smelled
the
marijuana.
i
just
was
trying
to
stick
to
the
relevant
points.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
add
that
to
the
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
that's
what
i
mean,
and
i
don't
always
spell
it
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
agree
that
--
that
the
court
below
is
wrong
because
what
they
say
as
i
read
it
is
irrespective
of
how
reasonably
the
police
behave,
if
it
is
reasonably
foreseeable
that
their
tactic
will
create
exigent
circumstances
--
and
i
would
think
it's
reasonably
foreseeable
when
you
knock
on
the
door
very
politely
and
say
"the
police"
that
somebody
might
shout
out
"hide
the
pot",
all
right?
that
if
that's
reasonable
foreseeable,
says
the
court,
then
that
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
but
we
have
the
second
circuit
that
says
as
long
as
the
police
behaved
unlawfully
--
it
--
lawfully,
lawfully,
it
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment;
and
we
have
the
first
circuit
that
has
some
kind
of
bad
faith
test
plus
an
unreasonable
or
improper
test;
and
we
have
the
fourth
and
eighth
circuits
that
yet
have
some
different
kind
of
test.
and
one
of
the
things
i
would
be
interested
in
hearing
your
view
on
at
some
point
is
just
what
the
chief
justice
said;
that
assuming
from
your
point
of
view
this
is
a
hypothetical
case,
nonetheless
we
would
like
your
view
on
which
of
those
tests
or
some
other
test
is
the
appropriate
test
and
why.
that
was
the
question
he
started
with,
and
justice
kennedy
started
with,
and
i
also
would
be
interested
in
your
view
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
said
--
just
add
on
to
that.
look,
the
question
presented
that
they
raised
which
of
the
five
tests
currently
being
used
by
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
is
proper?
now,
you've
said
something
about
your
view
on
that,
but
i
would
like
you
to
say
anything
else
you
would
like
to
say
about
that:
which
of
the
five
tests
or
some
sixth
test
if
you
like,
and
you
tell
me
the
words
that
you
like
us
to
use
when
we
answer
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
but
the
test
you're
using
there,
the
key
word
there
is
unreasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
and
the
reason
you
choose
the
word
"unreasonable"
rather
than
the
second
circuit's
test
of
"unlawful"
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
test,
it's
--
it's
not
wild.
it
just
says
unreasonable
in
the
fourth
amendment.
probably
when
they
act
lawfully,
they
are
acting
reasonably
and
not
unreasonably,
but
it
could
be
sometimes
they're
not.
that's
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
test.
all
right.
