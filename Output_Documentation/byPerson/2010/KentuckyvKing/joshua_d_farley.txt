mr.
joshua
d.
farley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
you
today,
of
whether
or
not
police
can
impermissibly
create
exigent
circumstances,
arises
from
the
improper
suppression
of
reasonably
seized
evidence
after
a
reasonable
warrantless
entry.
the
test
set
forth
by
the
kentucky
supreme
court
is
improper
for
several
reasons,
the
first
of
which
is
that
this
court
has
routinely
held
that
the
subjective
intent
of
police
officers
when
effecting
a
warrantless
entry
is
irrelevant.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
well,
the
kentucky
supreme
court's
first
prong
of
their
test,
and
i
believe
it's
in
our
petition
appendix
on
page
26
--
i'm
sorry.
their
--
their
discussion
starts
on
page
44a
and
carries
over
to
46a.
the
first
question
of
their
test
is
whether
or
not
the
officers
acted
in
bad
faith
in
an
attempt
to
purposefully
evade
the
warrant
requirements.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
that
is
correct.
the
second
prong
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court's
test
is
whether
or
not
the
actions
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
or
the
occupant
of
the
home
would
have
been
foreseeable
by
the
police
officers
before
they
knocked
and
announced
their
presence.
now,
the
problem
with
the
foreseeability
test--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
it
--
it
isn't
directly
a
subjective
inquiry.
however,
police
officers
are
trained
to
expect
and
foresee
illegal
activity
so
that
they
may
carry
out
the
duties
of
their
job
in
protecting
the
citizens.
so
under
a
foreseeability
test,
a
police
officer
will
always
foresee
illegal
activity
in
response
to
his
actions.
be
it
walking
down
the
street
or
knocking
on
your
door,
a
reasonable
officer
will
always
foresee
illegal
activity,
and
for
that
reason,
the
kentucky
supreme
court's
test
is
completely
unworkable.
several
of
the
other
circuits
and
the
lower
courts
have
adopted
tests
that
also
attempt
to
add
an
extra
exception,
an
unwarranted
closure
of
the
exigent
circumstances
exception
that
narrows
the
use
of
that
exception
by
police
officers.
the
test
that
the
commonwealth
would
propose
is
a
simple
lawfulness
test.
now,
under
this
test,
as
long
as
an
officer
behaves
lawfully,
there
should
be
no
suppression
of
evidence
seized
after
an
otherwise
reasonable
search--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--well,
there's
--
i
would
say
yes,
if
there
is
probable
cause
as
well
as--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--well,
i
would
assert
that
there
are
--
there
are
two
separate
issues
here.
you
must
have
probable
cause
separate
from
the
existence
of
exigent
circumstances.
in
this
case
there
was
probable
cause
due
to
the
smell
of
marijuana.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
justice
ginsburg,
under
a
simple
lawfulness
test,
since
the
officers
have
not
violated
the
fourth
amendment
prior
to
the
exigency
arising,
there
would
be
no
need
to
suppress
any
evidence.
that
would
be
perfectly
fine
for
the
officers
to
do
that.
it
may
not
be
the
most--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--yes,
if
--
if
probable
cause
exists.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
well,
under
the
fourth
amendment
for
a
reasonable
warrantless
search
to
occur,
a
police
officer
must
have--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--yes.
the
police
officers
must
have--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--they
must
have
probable
cause
coupled
with
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
there
are
two
separate
issues
here.
they
must
have
probable
cause
aside
from
exigent
circumstances.
then
they
must
also
have
a
reasonable--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--no,
justice
kennedy.
they
can
just--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--they
could
knock
on
the
door.
however--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--he
could
knock
on
the
door.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
the
smell
of--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--well,
the
smell
of
marijuana
would
give
probable
cause
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
once
he
knocks
on
the
door
and
hears
noises
consistent
with
the
destruction
of
physical
evidence,
then
an
exigency
has
arised.
now
the
officer
has
both
probable
cause
and
an
exigent
circumstance--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--well,
i
think
--
i
think
we're
confused.
in
order
to
enter
with
exigent
circumstances,
you
must
also
have
separate
probable
cause,
and--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--beyond
the
reasonable
belief--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--yes.
correct.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
that
is
correct.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
it
could
be.
it
could
very
well
be.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
yes,
justice
scalia,
you're
absolutely
correct.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
yes.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
yes.
the
exigent
circumstances
is
a
reasonable
belief
based
upon
the
totality
of
the
surrounding
circumstances.
here,
given
that
the
officers
had
a
reasonable
belief
that
they
were
chasing
a
fleeing
felon,
they
had
a
reasonable
belief
that
this
was
the
doorway
he
had
entered,
then
you
couple
that
with
the
noises
that
they
heard,
they
testified
were
based
on
their
training--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--and
experience.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
that
--
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
however
--
and
--
we
cannot
divorce
the
officers'
chase
of
this
suspect,
regardless
of
whether
he
knew
of
their
hot
pursuit
or
not,
we
cannot
divorce
those
facts
from
what
the
officers
knew
when
they
knocked
on
the
door.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
certainly.
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice.
you're
absolutely
correct.
i
was
--
i
was
just
speaking
in
terms
of
this
case,
saying
that
there
were
--
there
was
ample
evidence
that
exigent
circumstances
existed
here,
coupled
with
the
probable
cause.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
well,
the
officers
testified
under
these
circumstances
that
they
believed
that
they
were
in
hot
pursuit
of
this
felon.
so
at
the
time
they
were
at
the
door
they
believed
he
had
entered
this
apartment
and
was
aware
of
their
presence
and
was
destroying
evidence
of
his
deal
of
crack
cocaine,
so
this
is
an
evolving--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--well--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--well,
i
would
disagree
with
you.
i
think
that
when
determining
whether
an
exigent
circumstance
exists,
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
so
--
and
there
would
be
a
myriad
of
cases
in
which
a
court
would
determine
that,
simply
based
upon
the
testimony
or
the
noises
that
were
heard,
with
no
surrounding
circumstances,
that
exigent
circumstances
may
not
have
existed.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
they
could
have
sought
a
consensual
encounter
with
the
occupant--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--then
the
officers
would
not
have
been
able
to
force
entry.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
well,
i
don't
if
i
--
i
don't
know
that
i
would
phrase
it
--
there
is
no
--
there
is
not
a
requirement
to
inform
an
occupant
of
a
right
to
denial.
however,
the
officers
could
not
have
forced
their
way
into
the
home.
that
would
have
made
this
a
case
like
johnson.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
i
believe
that's
still
fine
under
a
lawfulness
test,
unless
the
occupant
of
the
home
submits
to
that
show
of
authority
and
comes
to
the
door
and
allows
entry.
now,
if--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--well,
i
believe
that
the
noises
that
they
heard
were
consistent
with
destruction
of
physical
evidence
based
upon--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--no,
no.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
so
no,
no,
of
course
not.
they
would
have
to
obtain
a
warrant
at
that
point.
if
the
person
came
to
the
door
and
denied
them
consent,
they
would
have
to
obtain
a
warrant.
if
the
person
did
not
come
to
the
door
and
made
--
no
exigency
arose,
then
the
officers
would
still
have
to
go
and
obtain
a
warrant.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
i
--
justice
kennedy,
i
--
i
would
tend
to
--
i
would
tend
to
agree
with
you.
however,
i
know
this
court
in
johnson
stated
that
the
smell
of
burning
opium
was
not
the
destruction
of
evidence,
and
the
only
thing
they
could
have
obtained
would
have
been
the
fumes
or
the
vapors.
i
tend
to
agree
--
disagree
with
that
personally.
however,
from
a
legal
viewpoint.
the
simple
smell
of
burning
marijuana
is
not--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--correct,
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
yes.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
well,
what
occurred
in
johnson,
i
believe,
is
--
is
completely
different
than
what
occurred
here.
what
occurred
in
johnson
was
the
officers
forced
their
way
into
the
occupant's
apartment
--
the
occupant's
hotel
room,
and
then
said:
consider
yourself
under--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--well,
they
did,
and
they
knocked
on
the
door,
and
she
came
to
the
door
and
they
--
they
forced
their
way
in.
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
"let
us
in",
there
was
no
demand
for
entry,
there
was
no
even
ask
for
consent
to
enter.
they
then
said:
consider
yourself
under
arrest.
they
searched,
and
then
held
her
under
arrest
based
upon
the
evidence
that
they
obtained.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
well,
i
believe
they
heard
sounds
when
they
knocked
on
the
door.
but
she
actually
came
to
the
door
and
the
officers
forced
entry.
here
we
don't
have
that.
we
have
no
forced
entry.
these
are
two
different
circumstances.
johnson,
an
exigency
did
not
exist.
here
an
exigency
does
exist.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
thank
you.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
my
time
is
short,
so
i
would
like
to
just
make
a
few
quick
points.
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy
were
absolutely,
absolutely
correct.
the
question
before
this
court
is:
can
lawful
police
action
impermissibly
create
exigent
circumstances?
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
there
is
never
a
circumstance
in
which
lawful
police
behavior
under
a
fourth
amendment
analysis
can
impermissibly
create
an
exigency.
i
would
point
the
court
to
hodari
d.,
which
i
believe
justice
scalia
wrote
for
the
court,
that
we
should
not
punish
police
officers
for
attempted
fourth
amendment
violations
or
fourth
amendment
violations
that
do
not
reach
fruition,
because
it
does
not
serve
the
point
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
well,
justice
kagan,
i
would
disagree
with
you.
i
don't
think
that
it
would.
i
believe
that
what
the
commonwealth
is
asking
for
is
no
more
or
no
less
than
reviewing
courts
have
done
for
generations.
you
look
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
whether
there
was
an
unlawful
entry,
whether
there
was
an
unlawful
seizure,
or
whether
there
was
a
coercion
that
then
they
gained
consent
for
entry.
if
those
things
occurred,
they
are
clearly
fourth
amendment
violations.
there
should
be
a
suppression
of
the
evidence.
the
exigent
circumstances--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
no,
justice
scalia,
it
would
not.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
i
believe
under
hodari
d.,
if
the
officers
demand
entry
and
there
has
been
no
response
to
that
demand,
there
has
no
--
been
no
completion
of
the
fourth
amendment
violation.
the
officers
could
stand
outside
the
door--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--i
believe
that
there
are
--
there
are
large
restrictions
and
prohibitions
to
that,
that
officers
are
well
aware
of,
because
if
the
person
does
answer
the
door,
the
officers
know,
well,
everything
is
going
to
be
suppressed.
or
it's--
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
--well,
if
they
demand
entry
and
entry
is
given,
that
is
then
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
because
they've
demanded
entry
without
a
warrant.
and
in
that
case,
suppression
--
once
they
have
entry,
the
evidence
would
be
suppressed.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
no.
mr.
joshua
d.
farley
we
would
just
assert
that
under
the
lawfulness
test,
we
aren't
asking
for
anything
more
or
less
than
this
court
has
done
or
other
reviewing
courts
have
done
for
generations,
and
this
is
a
simple
fourth
amendment
analysis.
there
was
no
demand
in
this
case.
this
was
a
simple
knock-and-announce
case,
regardless
of
the
time
of
day.
there
was
no
coercion.
there
was
no
seizure.
there
was
no
consent
given.
officers
should
not
be
held
accountable
for
unlawful
reactions
by
suspects.
thank
you.
