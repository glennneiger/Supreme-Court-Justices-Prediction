where
did
the
--
where
did
the
kentucky
supreme
court
--
where
did
the
kentucky
supreme
court
say
that
it
was
looking
to
a
subjective
state
of
mind
on
the
part
of
the
police?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
didn't
--
that
didn't
apply
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
--
why
is
that
subjective?
why
isn't
that,
wouldn't
it
be
foreseeable
to
a
reasonable
police
officer
similarly
situated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
go
to
the
apartment
building
and
they
sniff
at
every
door,
and
when
they
sniff,
when
a
strong
smell
of
marijuana
emanates
from
the
door,
then
they
go
through
this
routine,
but
they
do
it
as
a
matter
of
every
2
weeks,
as
the
chief
said,
as
a
routine
matter.
they
don't
just
knock
on
every
door,
but
they
knock
on
the
doors
where
they
smell
marijuana,
and
they
do
that
just
as
a
routine,
in
all
the
buildings
where
they
suspect
there
may
be
drug
--
drugs
being
stashed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
may
we
just--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
farley,
may
we
just
go
back
over
--
you're
putting
in
the
fleeing
felon,
but
as
far
as
i
understand
from
this
record,
it
was
never
shown
that
the
dealer
that
the
police
were
following
was
aware
that
he
was
following
and
that
he
was
fleeing
from
them.
i
mean,
this
is
the
--
it's
not
part
of
the
question
you
presented,
because
we've
granted
only
on
the
exigent
circumstances,
but
i
didn't
think
that
there
was
--
the
dealer
wasn't
called
and
he
wasn't
asked
did
you
even
know
that
the
police
were
following
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
question
--
may
i
ask
a
question
that
goes
back
to
what
you
said?
you
have
clarified
very
nicely
that
there
has
to
be
probable
cause
to
think
that
there's
something
wrong
going
on
in
the
--
the
apartment;
and
you
said
that
is,
at
that
point
when
they
--
the
marijuana
strong
smell
comes
from
the
door,
at
that
point
police
could
go
and
get
a
warrant.
then
they
don't
have
to,
because
then
they
knocked
on
the
door.
we
start
out
with
a
strong
presumption
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
a
warrant,
a
strong
preference
for
getting
the
warrant.
so
why
in
this
situation
wouldn't
the
first
response
of
the
police
be,
instead
of
knocking
--
because
once
they
knock
they
alert
the
people
in
there
--
let's
get
a
warrant;
we'll
come
back?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
is
it
--
you
mention
johnson.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
the
other
side
says
it
was
the
same
thing
except
it
was
a
hotel
room
instead
of
an
apartment
building.
the
police
smell,
in
that
case
it
was
--
what
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
they
smell
marijuana
or
opium
or
something?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
left
out
one
thing.
i
thought
they
heard
rustling
noises
before
they
attempted
to
get
into
the
apartment
--
into
the
hotel
room.
there
was
something
about
noises.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
was
that
here?
because
it
is
kind
of
vague.
they
heard
movement.
what
kind
--
what
kind
of
movement?
it
said
nothing
about
a
toilet
flushing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
your
test
is
something
novel
--
justice
breyer
mentioned
there
are
some
five
tests
in
the
different
circuits,
and
the
foreseeability
test
is
the
one
that
the
kentucky
supreme
court
used,
but
is
your
--
does
your
test
coincide
with
the
tests
of
any
other
circuits
or
is
it
different?
