chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
09-1272,
kentucky
v.
king.
mr.
farley.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
you
have
an
apartment
building
where
the
police
know
from
experience
there
is
a
lot
of
illegal
activity,
a
lot
of
drugs,
drug
transactions.
every
2
weeks
they
walk
through
and
knock
on
every
door
and
wait
for
evidence
of
the
destruction
of
--
of
--
of
drugs.
is
that
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
probable
cause,
of
course,
comes
when
they
hear
the,
you
know,
flushing
and,
you
know,
the
hiding
or
whatever
behind
the
door.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
think
i
have
got
two
different
probable
causes
that's
caused
--
causing
me
some
confusion.
i
understand
their
requirement
of
probable
cause,
and
that
they
hear
sound
of
evidence
being
destroyed
and
therefore
enter.
is
that
--
or
are
you
talking
about
the
probable
cause
to
think
there's
something
going
on
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there's
only
one
probable
cause,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure,
you
can.
there's
nothing
illegal
about
walking
down
the
hall
and
knocking
on
somebody's
door;
and
if
as
a
police
officer
you
say,
but
i
smell
marijuana,
and
then
you
hear
the
flushing,
then
there's
probable
cause.
you
don't
need
any
business
about
the
dealer
and
the
breezeway
and
all
that
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
farley.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
o'connell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
o'connell.
ms.
drake.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you're--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you're
describing
what
you
think
the
evidence
was
to
support
exigency,
and
the
suggestion
we
have
heard
on
the
other
side
is
that
that's
an
issue
that
can
be
addressed
on
remand
once
we,
according
to
the
other
side,
correct
the
state
court's
error
in
that
this
--
you
--
the
police
cannot
create
exigent
circumstances.
so
i
--
i
don't
know
that
it's
terribly
relevant
what
the
underlying
facts
about
what
they
heard
was.
that
will
be
relevant
depending,
or
not,
depending
on
what
our
opinion
says.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it's
--
it's
not
at
all.
the
court
said:
i
don't
care
whether
exigent
circumstances
existed;
you
cannot
create
exigent
circumstances;
so
i
don't
care
whether
they
were
or
not.
the
legal
standard
is
antecedent
to
the
application
of
the
facts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
sure,
there
is.
it
was
dismissed
because
the
state
supreme
court
held
you
can't
bring
this
evidence
in.
if
we
say,
oh,
yes,
you
can,
then
the
issue
comes
live
again.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
the
argument
you
presented
to
us
in
the
letter,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and,
yet,
we
nonetheless
decided
to
have
argument?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
maybe
it
would
be
--
it's
your
case,
but
maybe
it
would
be
best
to
move
on
to
the
legal
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where's
--
no
"open
up".
i
thought
you
said
earlier
they
said
"open
up"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
after
--
after
the
exigent
circumstances
or
the
alleged
exigent
circumstances
were
presented?
that's
after
they
heard
what
they
thought,
and
i
know
you
disagree,
was
the
destruction
of
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
trying
to
change
the
case.
i
mean,
this
is
not
a
case
where
they
come
in
and,
in
effect,
demand
entry.
my
understanding
is
that
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
after
a
request
for
entry,
they
can
then
base
probable
cause
and
dispensing
with
the
warrant
based
on
what
they
hear
from
behind
the
door.
now,
i
know
you
think
whatever
they
hear
is
perfectly
innocent;
but
the
issue
is
whenever
they
knock
on
the
door,
"police",
or
"can
we
come
in"
or
whatever,
and
then
they
hear
that
--
the
activity
behind
the
door,
they
have
reason
and
can
--
can
enter.
now,
what
you're
--
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
arguing
is
well,
they
did
something
else.
they
banged
on
the
door,
they
yelled
police;
it
wasn't
simply
knocking
on
the
door
and
seeking
entry.
and
you
may
be
right,
again,
on
the
facts,
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
for
--
for
later
on.
i
want
to
know
what
your
position
is
on
whether
they
can
assume,
at
least
for
me,
they
knock
and
say
can
we
come
in
or
knock
and
say
police,
no
demand
to
get
in.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
just
assume
for
--
for
my
sake
that
the
police
comes
to
the
door.
it's
not
10:00
at
night,
it's
you
know,
6:00
at
night,
knocks
quietly
on
the
door,
and
says
we're
the
police,
can
we
talk?
and
then
there
was
the
smell
of
marijuana.
and
then
he
hears
the
sounds
that
do
convey
to
a
reasonable
police
officer
that
evidence
is
being
destroyed.
at
that
point
can
they
enter
without
a
warrant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know
--
you
don't
know
what
--
you
don't
know
what
unlawful
means,
but
you
know
what
unreasonable
means?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
--
what
is
an
example
of
conduct
that
you
would
consider
unreasonable
resulting
in
suppression
of
the
evidence
that
would
not
be
unlawful?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
can't
--
can't
give
me
one
example
of
some
conduct
that's
unreasonable
under
your
test
that
would
not
be
unlawful?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
farley,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
can't
gain
entry
by
deception.
they
can't
knock
on
the
door
and
say,
pizza,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no?
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
you
will
have
noticed
that
justice
kennedy
left
the
bench
a
few
minutes
early.
he
is
going
to
tucson
to
represent
the
court
as
the
circuit
justice
for
the
ninth
circuit
at
the
memorial
service
there.
he
will
review
the
tapes
and
transcripts
of
the
rest
of
the
argument
and
fully
participate
in
the
decision.
this
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
09-1272,
kentucky
versus
king.
he
has
asked
that
i
announce
it
for
him.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky.
in
this
case,
police
officers
smelled
marijuana
outside
an
apartment
door,
knocked
loudly,
and
announced
their
presence.
as
soon
as
the
officers
began
knocking,
they
heard
noises
that,
in
their
view,
indicated
that
the
occupants
were
destroying
drug-related
evidence.
the
officers
entered
the
apartment
without
a
warrant
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
evidence.
respondent
was
convicted
of
drug-related
offenses
based
on
evidence
that
the
officers
found
inside
the
apartment.
now,
it
is
well-established
that
the
rule
of
exigent
circumstances
which
includes
the
need
to
prevent
destruction
of
evidence
is
an
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
we
do
not
decide
whether
exigent
circumstances
actually
existed
in
this
case.
we,
like
the
kentucky
supreme
court,
assume
that
there
was
an
exigency.
the
question
before
us
concerns
an
exception
to
the
exigent
circumstances
rule
that
has
been
developed
by
lower
courts.
lower
courts
have
held
that
when
police
create
an
exigency,
the
search
is
unconstitutional,
even
though
an
exigency
existed.
this
is
known
as
the
"police-created
exigency"
doctrine.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
applied
the
police-created
exigency
doctrine
in
this
case,
overturning
respondent's
conviction.
assuming
there
was
an
exigency,
the
kentucky
supreme
court
held
that
the
exigent
circumstances
rule
could
not
justify
the
search
because
the
police
should
have
foreseen
that
their
conduct
would
prompt
the
occupants
to
destroy
evidence.
in
short,
the
court
held
that
the
police
had
impermissibly
created
the
exigency.
for
the
reason
stated
in
our
opinion,
we
reject
this
interpretation
of
the
exigent
circumstances
rule.
the
conduct
of
the
police,
prior
to
their
entry
into
the
apartment,
was
entirely
lawful.
they
banged
on
the
door
and
announced
their
presence.
they
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
nor
did
they
threaten
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
under
these
circumstances,
the
officers'
warrantless
entry
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
evidence
was
reasonable.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
