to
knock
on
the
door?
they
must
have
probable
cause
to
knock
on
the
door?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
take
us--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--take
us
through
it
--
take
us
through
it
chronologically.
the
policeman
is
walking
through
the
hallway,
he
has
no
probable
cause.
he
--
he--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--he
smells
marijuana--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--then
he
knocks
on
the
door.
when
does
the
probable
cause
arise
and
when
must
it
arise?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
may
be
a
bit
rudimentary,
but
can
you
tell
me
why
isn't
the
evidence
isn't
always
being
destroyed
when
the
marijuana
is
being
smoked?
isn't
it
being
burnt
up?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
distinction
is
being
destroyed
as
opposed
to
being
consumed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
position
that
the
police
can
do
anything
that's
lawful,
even
if
the
purpose
of
doing
so
is
to
create
exigent
circumstances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
question
presented
in
the
blue
brief
used
the
word
"impermissible",
and
we're
talking
about
unlawful.
i
take
it
that
there
is
a
difference
in
those,
or
no
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
think
the
court
is
interested
in
taking
the
case
on
the
question
whether
or
not
the
police
may
create
exigent
circumstances
and
use
those
exigent
circumstances
to
enter.
now,
whether
or
not
there
were
exigent
circumstances
here
because
of
the
sound
is
--
is
it
seems
to
me
a
subsidiary
question.
