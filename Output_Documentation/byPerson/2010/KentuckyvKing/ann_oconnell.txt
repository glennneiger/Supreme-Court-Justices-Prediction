ms.
ann
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
police
officers
act
lawfully
in
conducting
their
investigation,
they
may
respond
to
any
exigencies
that
arise.
it
is
up
to
police
officers
to
determine
how
they
will
collect
evidence
in
any
given
case
as
long
as
they
stay
within
the
confines
of
the
fourth
amendment.
although
securing
a
warrant--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
sotomayor.
i
think
that
in
any
case--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
a
person
might
not--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--a
person
doesn't
have
to
answer
the
door.
a
person
might
come
to
the
door,
they
might
also
ignore
whose
ever
at
the
door.
both
of
those
options
are
fine.
ms.
ann
o'connell
i
mean,
i
--
i
guess
that
a
person
is
entitled
to
do
that.
ms.
ann
o'connell
i
mean,
i
think
that
that
--
that's
certainly
a
lawful
option
that
somebody
has
when
the
police
officers
knock
at
their
door.
and
certainly
in
this
case--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--that's--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--i
guess
some
people
might
do
that
if
they
don't
want
to
give
consent
to
police
entry.
i
think
that
in
order
to
go
in
based
on
an
exigent
circumstance
the
police
would
have
to
be
able
to
articulate
to
a
court
that
they
objectively,
reasonably
believed
that
there
was
destruction
of
evidence
occurring
inside.
ms.
ann
o'connell
justice
ginsburg,
it's
our
position
that
the
court
should
assume
that
there
was
an
exigency
in
this
case.
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
opposition,
he
argued
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
of
exigency.
the
court
nonetheless
granted
cert
on
the
question
of
whether
a
police-created
exigency
would
be
okay
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
solicitor
general
believes
that
the
court
should
assume
there
was
an
exigency,
and
if
it
agrees
with
kentucky
on
the
question
presented
and
then
reverses,
it
should
remand
to
the
kentucky
supreme
court
for
a
determination
of
whether
an
exigency
existed.
the
trial
court
in
this
case
certainly
found
that
the
movement
inside
of
the
apartment
was
enough
for
the
officer
to
reasonably
conclude
that
somebody
inside
was
destroying
evidence.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
assumed
that
that
was
so
in
order
to
reach
the
question
presented
in
this
case
that
the
court
granted
cert
on.
ms.
ann
o'connell
i
think
the
problem
with
that
test,
justice
kagan,
is
that
police
officers
have
options
of
how
they
can
conduct
searches
and
seizures.
getting
a
warrant
is
one
way
that
they
could
do
that.
getting
consent
to
conduct
a
search
or
a
seizure
is
another
way.
there's
no
justification
in
this
court's
precedents
for
requiring
police
officers
to
choose
one
of
those
options
over
another
if
both
options
are
lawful.
in
this
case,
the
police
officers
knocked
on
the
door,
not
sure
which
apartment
the
person
that
they
were
pursuing
fled
into,
in
order
to
determine
whether
that
was
the
correct
apartment.
there's
no
reason
why
they
needed
to
get
a
warrant
before
knocking
on
the
door
and
seeking
cooperation
of
the
people
inside.
ms.
ann
o'connell
yes,
i
think
that
under
this
court
--
the
way
that
this
court
has
interpreted
fourth
amendment
warrant
exceptions,
as
long
as
there
is
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
that
is
okay.
the
police
officers
can
rely
on
any
ensuing
exigency.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
yes,
there
is
a
difference.
i
think
that
that
comes
up
in
respondent's
argument
that
if
there
was
an
impermissible
demand
for
entry
--
for
example,
if
the
police
officer
said,
i
have
a
warrant,
let
me
in,
even
though
he
didn't,
as
in
bumper
v.
north
carolina
--
that
that
could
still
be
okay
under
a
lawfulness
test
as
long
as
the
suspect
reacted
by
destroying
evidence
instead
of
by
coming
to
the
door
like
in
bumper
or
johnson
and
going
about
with--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--justice
breyer,
the
objection
to
that
is
simply
that
in
all
cases
that
are
founded
upon
probable
cause
that
are
not
programmatic
searches
that
are
conducted
without
any
individualized
suspicion,
this
court
has
repeatedly
rejected
prongs
of
a
fourth
amendment
test
that
--
that
rely
on
the
subjective--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--i'm
sorry,
i
don't--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--i
guess
that
it's
not
totally
clear
what
bad
faith
would
mean
in
this
context.
ms.
ann
o'connell
justice
breyer,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
what
it
means
to
act
in
bad
faith
in
a
case
like
this
as
a
police
officer.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
justice
alito,
i
think
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
objectively
whether
that
was
the
case.
certainly--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--i
think
that
there's
already
a
significant
risk
built
into
the
fourth
amendment
that
police
officers,
if
they
knock
on
the
door
and
they
don't
hear
somebody
destroying
evidence
inside,
they're
going
to
have
to
leave
and
get
a
warrant.
i
think
that's
enough
of
a--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--right,
and
i
think
that
there's
--
the
court
shouldn't
be
concerned,
and
certainly
shouldn't
be
concerned
enough
to
adopt
a
bad
faith
or
a
subjective
motivation
prong
to
a
test
that
it
creates--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--that's
true,
and,
justice
sotomayor,
to
be
clear--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--i
think
the
fact
that
if
the
person
actually
does
what
the
police
officer
says
and
answers
the
door
will
mean
that
the
evidence
would
be
excluded
as
a
coerced
consent
search
is
enough
of
a
deterrent
to
that
sort
of
conduct.
ms.
ann
o'connell
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
ms.
ann
o'connell
i
think
that's
right,
if
the
person
submits
to
the
command.
