but
i
don't
understand
why
the
smell
of
marijuana
is
necessary.
this
goes
back
to
what
justice
sotomayor
was
saying,
you
don't
need
probable
cause
to
knock
on
a
door.
knocking
on
a
door
is
perfectly
lawful.
so,
if
there's
just
a
lawfulness
test,
the
knock
is
fine.
and
then
when
you
hear
whatever
it
is
that
you
hear
that
you
think
creates
exigent
circumstances,
whether
it's
a
toilet
flushing
or
whether
it's
just
noise,
that
too
gives
you
the
ability
to
go
right
in.
so
--
so
if
it's
just
lawfulness,
you
don't
need
the
marijuana
smell
even,
do
you?

probable
cause
beyond
thinking
that
the

justice

okay.
justice
elena

ms.
o'connell,
if
i
could
ask
you
about
the
government's
proposed
standard:
you
say
that
as
long
as
each
step
in
the
police
conduct
is
lawful,
that's
sufficient,
and
each
step
would
--
the
way
the
fourth
amendment
works,
each
step,
we're
asking,
essentially,
whether
each
step
is
reasonable.
what
some
courts
have
done
in
addition
to
that
--
and
this
was
not
the
approach
of
the
court
below
--
but
what
some
courts
have
done
is
to
say,
we
also
ask
a
more
holistic
reasonableness
question.
we
say:
is
the
whole
process
by
which
the
police
operated
with
respect
to
this
person
reasonable?
so,
for
example,
we
might
say,
you
know:
was
there
time
to
get
a
warrant
or
did
it
look
like
the
police
were
just
--
they
preferred
not
to
have
to
deal
with
a
magistrate?
so
what's
wrong
with
that
sort
of
standard?
in
addition
to
asking
whether
each
step
is
reasonable,
to
say:
look,
is
the
whole
pattern
here
of
what
the
police
did
to
come
up
with
this
evidence
reasonable?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
ms.
drake
if
that's
the
case,
in
some
way
you're
agreeing
with
the
government.
you,
too,
are
saying
that
--
that
there's
a
lawfulness
test.
you're
just
disagree
about
what's
lawful.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
farley,
one
of
the
points
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
ensure
that
when
people
search
your
home,
they
have
a
warrant,
and
of
course
there
are
exceptions
to
that.
but
if
there
is
one
place
where
the
warrant
requirement
has
real
force,
it's
in
the
home.
and
i
think
that
the
concern
here,
and
you
have
some
strong
arguments
on
your
side,
but
the
concern
here
is
that
your
test
is
going
to
enable
the
police
to
penetrate
the
home,
to
search
the
home,
without
a
warrant,
without
going
to
see
a
magistrate,
in
a
very
wide
variety
of
cases,
that
all
the
police
really
have
to
say
is:
we
saw
pot,
we
heard
noise.
or:
we
think
there
was
some
criminal
activity
going
on
for
whatever
reason
and
we
heard
noise.
how
do
you
prevent
that
from
happening?
how
do
you
prevent
your
test
from
essentially
eviscerating
the
warrant
requirement
in
the
context
of
the
one
place
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
most
concerned
about?
