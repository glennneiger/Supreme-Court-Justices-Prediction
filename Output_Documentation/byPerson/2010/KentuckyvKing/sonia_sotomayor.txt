justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
the
chief
justice
when
he
said
--
and
i
think
this
was
the
solicitor
general's
position
--
that
the
police
can
routinely
knock
at
a
door
and
wait
to
see
if
they
hear
a
toilet
flushing.
i
--
i've
taken
it
out
of
this
case
but
--
because
i
don't
know
what
noise
means.
but
your
answer
would
be
yes?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
why
--
why
do
you
need
the
probable
cause
inquiry?
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
anything?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
before
they
can
go
in--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
they
have
just
heard
the
toilet
flushing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
in
your
view--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
why
was
--
how
does
this
holding
by
us
not
become
a
simple
warrantless
entry
in
any
drug
case,
meaning
police
knock
on
the
door,
suspect
doesn't
answer
it,
gets
up
and
moves
to
their
bedroom?
because
there's
no
noise
that
was
described
by
this
police
officer.
it
was
simply
not
answering
the
door
and
moving.
so
if
that's
all
it
takes,
any
police
officer
will
come
in
and
say:
in
my
experience,
most
drug
dealers
destroy
the
evidence
when
we
knock.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
aren't
we
just
doing
away
with
johnson?
and
aren't
we
just
simply
saying
they
can
just
walk
in
whenever
they
smell
marijuana,
whenever
they
think
there's
drugs
on
the
other
side?
why
do
we
even
bother
giving
them
a
--
a
warrant?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
if
the
officers
had
simply
knocked,
said
we're
going
to
kick
the
door
in
if
you
don't
open
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
--
does
a
ruling
in
this
case
that
any
lawful
conduct
by
the
police
mean
that
the
police
knock,
somebody
gets
up
on
the
other
side
and
walks
through
a
closed
door,
and
closes
a
door
in
the
back,
and
police
say
in
my
experience
it's
--
it's
consistent
with
the
destruction
of
property
that
drug
dealers
will
go
into
a
closed
room
to
get
rid
of
it.
is
that
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
makes
that
different
than
knocking
on
the
door
and
saying,
open
the
door
or
i'm
going
to
kick
it
in?
you're
saying
that's
lawful
because
until
the
person
submits,
you're
suggesting
there's
no
coercion
in
that
whatsoever.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
wouldn't
that
objectively
be
bad
faith
if
what
we
find
out
is
they
now
have
a
tactic
which
is
they
go
through
this
building
and
every
time
they
smell
marijuana,
hash,
or
--
i
don't
know
if
crack
cocaine
smells
or
not
when
they're
smoking
it,
but
whenever
they
smell
something,
they
just
do
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there's
no
bad
faith
measure
whatsoever
in
your--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--analysis,
and
lawfulness
is
defined
by
actual
physical
seizure.
so
if
we
have
cases
that
suggest
something
else,
a
command
to
submit,
your
argument
would
be
lost,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
the
trial
court
make
those
findings?
i
know
that
you
said
it
in
your
brief,
and
i
thought
i
read
the
trial
court
record.
i
know
they
knocked
loudly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
else
did
they
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
--
the
police
officers'
lawfulness?
now,
i
--
i
grant
you
that
attempting
--
that
there
is
something
troubling
about
the
police
attempting
to
coerce
entry
as
opposed
to
requesting
entry;
but
as
my
colleagues
have
pointed
out,
it's
not
clear
from
this
record
which
of
the
two
the
police
did,
in
a
loud
voice
or
not.
you're
saying
just
a
loud
knock,
a
scream,
"police",
that
that
would
be
coercive?
that's
how
i'm
reading
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
--
or
are
you
going
further
and
trying
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
testimony's
critically
clear
that
they
knocked
loudly,
said
"police",
and
said
let
us
in
or
we're
going
to
bust
it?
