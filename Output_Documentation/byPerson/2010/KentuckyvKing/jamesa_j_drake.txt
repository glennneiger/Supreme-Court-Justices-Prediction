ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
odor
of
burnt
marijuana,
coupled
with
officer
cobb's
cursory
and
equivocal
testimony
about
the
sounds
of
movement
he
couldn't
discern
exactly
and
that
his
training
and
experience
led
him
only
possibly
to
conclude
was
consistent
with
the
destruction
of
evidence,
is
insufficient
to
establish
exigent
circumstances.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
it's
relevant
because
it
goes
to
whether
exigent
circumstances
existed.
and
as
to
the
question
of
whether
a
remand
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case,
the
question
of
whether
exigent
circumstances
existed
is
logically
antecedent
in
any
created
exigency
case.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
there's
no
point
in
delving
into
whether
an
exigency
was
created
by
the
police
if
there
is
no
exigency
to
begin
with.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
the
other
problem
with
remanding
this
case
for
further
determination
on
this
issue
is,
as
this
court
is
aware,
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
is
troubling.
the
case
has
already
been
dismissed.
there
is
no
potential
for
further
proceedings
here.
there
is
no--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--that
conclusion
is
dependent
on
the
notion
that
in
an
indictment
it's
merged
with
the
judgment
such
that
a
decision
in
the
commonwealth's
favor
in
this
case
would
vacate
the
decision
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court,
which
in
turn
vacates
the
underlying
suppression
order.
but
there
is
no
authority
for
the
notion
that
an
indictment
and
a
judgment
merge
as
a
matter
of
kentucky
law,
and
so
a
decision--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
if
we
move
to
the
question
of
whether
the
police
have
created
exigent
circumstances,
it's
important
that
we're
all
operating
on
the
same
understanding
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
simple
knock
at
the
door,
and
--
and
--
and
the
distinction
is
important.
in
this
case,
at
9:50
p.m.,
the
officers
banged
on
the
door
as
loudly
as
they
could.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
yes.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
yes.
and
this
is
located
at
the
appendix
to
the
petition
in
the
bottom
of
page
3a
carrying
on
to
4a.
the
trial
court
found:
detective
maynard,
who
was
accompanying
officer
cobb
in
the
breezeway
attempting
to
locate
and
arrest
the
suspect
in
question,
banged
on
the
door
of
the
apartment
on
the
back
left
of
the
breezeway,
identifying
themselves
as
police
officers
and
demanding
that
the
door
be
opened
by
persons
inside.
officer
cobb
testified
at
the
suppression
hearing,
and
this
is
at
page
22
of
the
joint
appendix:
detective
maynard
made
contact
with
the
door,
announced
our
presence,
banged
on
the
door
as
loud
as
we
could,
announced:
"police,
police,
police".
this
is
not
the
case
where--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--yes.
then
officer
cobb
later
goes
on
to
explain,
and
this
is
on
page
24
of
the
joint
appendix:
detective
maynard
with
sergeant
simmons
we
explained
to
them,
referring
to
the
occupants
of
the
apartment,
we
were
going
to
make
entry
inside
the
apartment.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
it's
--
it's
unclear
from
the
trial
court's
factual
finding
what
the
order
of
events
was.
the
trial
court
found,
banged
on
the
door
of
the
apartment,
identified
themselves
as
police
officers,
and--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--it's
unreasonable
conduct.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
well,
it's
certainly
not
unlawful
in
the
sense
that
it
violates
any
provision
of
the
penal
code.
but
this
is
a
fourth
amendment
case,
so
the
question
is
whether
it's
reasonable.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
i
have
two
responses
to
your
honor's
question.
the
first
is
that
--
and
along
with
this
notion
that
criminals
are
stupid
and
so
that's
why
we
get
all
these
criminal
cases,
there
is
no
difference
between
what
happened
in
this
case
and
how
an
innocent
person
would
respond.
recall
officer
cobb's
testimony
is
simply
that
after
banging
he
heard
movement.
any
innocent
person
at
10:00
at
night
would
have
to
move
in
order--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--the
portion
of
the
joint
appendix
that
i
quoted
to
the
court,
we
explained
to
them
we
were
going
to
make
entry,
appears
on
page
24.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
so,
if
your
honor
keeps
reading--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--yes.
officer
cobb's
testimony
suggests
that
the
demand
came
after
they
heard
the
sound
of
movement.
the
finding
by
the
trial
court,
however,
is
that
this
was
all
happening
simultaneously
and
in
very
quick
fashion.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
no,
your
honor.
officer
cobb's
testimony
was
--
was
all
the
commonwealth
offered.
but
the
chronology
of
the
demand
is
not
dispositive
in
this
case
because
the
demand
itself
is
not
dispositive.
the
demand
removes
any
doubt
that
the
officers
were
not
seeking
a
consensual
encounter,
but
you
still
have
the
behavior
of
banging
on
the
door.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
it
--
it
--
it
depends
entirely
on
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
interpret
that
behavior
as
the
officer
conveying
the
impression
that
entry
was
imminent
and
inevitable,
and
this
feeds
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
which
is,
well,
what
--
what
is
unreasonable
about
what
the
officers
did
here?
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
that
is
the
point.
those
are
all
relevant
criteria
because
in
every
fourth
amendment
case
we're
considering
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
the
officers
are
engaging
in
what
we
would
call
a
true
knock
and
talk.
they're
seeking
--
they're
on
--
the
scenario
is
such
that
no
one
would
doubt
they're
attempting
a
consensual
encounter.
our
position
is
because
that
behavior
is
reasonable,
it
is
not
made
unreasonable
by
the
fact
that
evidence
may
be
destroyed,
and
so
suppression
would
not
be
the
remedy.
but
again--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--the
appropriate
test
is
the
test
that
we
propose.
under
our
test,
the
police
act
unreasonably
when
they
convey
the
impression
to
an
--
to
a
reasonable
person
that
entry
is
imminent
and
inevitable.
our
test
follows
directly
from
the
fourth
amendment
requirement
that
people
in
their
homes
deserve
precision.
by
conveying
the
impression
that
entry
is
imminent
and
inevitable,
the
police
are
--
and
they
don't
have
judicial
authority
for
doing
that;
that
is,
there's
no
warrant
--
they
are
engaging
in
behavior
that
would
confuse
an
ordinary
citizen
and
make
him
or
her
uncertain
about
whether
the
assertion
of
right
to
privacy
and
security
in
the
home--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--and
to
the
extent
that
lawful
is
defined
as
a
synonym
for
unreasonable,
and
to
the
extent
that
there
does
not
need
to
be
a
completed
antecedent
fourth
amendment
violation,
we
would
agree.
there
is
area
of
agreement
between
the
commonwealth
and
i
and
it
is
on
the
issue
of
this
knock
and
talk.
of
course,
police
officers
need
to
have
the
investigative
tool
of
a
knock
and
talk.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
an
officer
attempting
to
gain
consensual
entry;
and
our
position
is
that
that's
not
made
unreasonable
by
factors
outside
the
officer's
control,
no
matter
how
foreseeable.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
this
is
not
a
knock
and
a
--
knock
and
talk
case,
this
is
a
knock
and
announce
case
or
a
knock
and
demand
case,
which
is
how
the
trial
court
characterized
it.
and
the
staff--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--yes,
it's
the
--
it's
the
banging,
not
knocking.
it's
announcement.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
banging,
not
a
soft
--
not
the
knock
that
you
would
expect
a
reasonable
person
to
engage
in,
in
the
ordinary
discourse
with
another
person,
or
that
you
would
expect
from
an
officer
attempting
to
gain
consensual--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--what
the
officers
did
in
this
case
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
saying
we're
going
to
kick
in
the
door.
now,
i
wouldn't
go
that
--
that
far,
but
it
--
it's
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
knock
and
announce,
which
is
exactly
the
behavior
the
police
engage
in
when
they
are
executing
a
warrant;
and
it
is
that
behavior
that
conveys
the
impression
that
an
occupant
has
no
authority
to
keep
the
officers
at
arm's
length.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
i
don't
disagree
that
the
lower
courts
did
not
analyze
the
problem
in
this
fashion,
did
not
analyze
the
question
in
this
fashion,
but
it's
a
legal
question
that
calls
for
an
examination
of
how
a
reasonable
person
would
interpret
the
behavior,
and
so--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--i--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--the
factual
record
is
clear.
the
--
officer
cobb
testified
he
banged
as
loud
as
possible.
this
is
--
this
not
the
normal
knock
that
an
officer
engages
in
when
he's
seeking
consensual
--
consent,
you
know,
consent
to
search,
and
this
is
at
10:00
at
night.
he's
saying
we
announced,
police,
police,
police,
exclamation
point;
that
--
that's
how
it
appears
in
the
record.
again--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--yes.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
i
would
like
this
court
to
adopt
the
test
that
we
have
proposed.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
which
is
that
an
officer
acts
unreasonably
when
he
or
she
conveys
the
impression
that
entry
into
a
home
is
imminent
and--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
because,
frankly,
i'm
not
sure
what
that
means,
and
i
think
that's
become
clear
in
the
context
of
this
briefing.
does
unlawful
mean
the
police
have
had
to
violate
a
provision
of
the
penal
code?
does
unlawful
mean,
as
the
commonwealth
is
contending,
that
there
has
to
be
a
completed
fourth
amendment
violation?
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
yes.
unreasonable
is
the
touchstone
of
every
you
know,
fourth
amendment
case,
and
so
we're
saying
there
does
not
have
to
be
an
antecedent
completed
fourth
amendment
violation.
the
question
is,
as
is
the
case
in
every
fourth
amendment
case,
did
the
officers
act--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
yes,
and
that's
why
my
answer
to
justice
kagan's
question
was
to
the
extent
that
unlawful
and
unreasonable
are
synonyms,
we
would
agree.
now,
if
the
court
is
not
terribly
--
does
not
find
our
test
convincing,
the
next-best
test,
we
believe,
is
a
foreseeability
test.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
our
test
is
a
novel
test.
it
has
not
been,
to
my
knowledge,
considered
by
any
of
the
other
circuits.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
that's
correct,
and
by
the
way--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--we're
not
saying
that
--
we're
essentially
saying
the
police
shouldn't
act
as
though
they
have
a
warrant
when
they
don't
have
one,
which
is
exactly
what
they
did
in
this
case,
and
that
proposition
is
not
new.
in
bumper,
this
court
made
clear
that
if
the
police
act
as
though
they
have
a
warrant
when
they
don't
have
one,
any
consent
would
be
coerced.
so
reviewing
courts
are
already
making
these
determinations
about
how
loud
was
the
knock
and
how
aggressive
was
the
demand,
simply
in
another
context.
by
the
other
--
on
the
other
hand,
police
officers
are
already
receiving
the
same
instruction
that
they
would
need
in
order
to
apply
our
rule,
which
is,
don't
act
as
though
you
have
a
warrant.
don't
engage
in
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
knock
and
announce
if
you
do
not
have
prior
judicial
authority.
and
what
is
appealing
about
our
test,
unlike
the
foreseeability
test,
which
we
believe
it's
a
refinement
of,
is
it
allows
for
conduct
by
the
police
that's
reasonable
at
its
inception
to
remain
reasonable
regardless
of
the
suspect's
response,
no
matter
how
foreseeable.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
well,
it's
very
hard.
it's
very
hard
to
conceive
of
where
the
daylight
would
be--
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
--between
those
terms,
reasonable
and
unlawful,
so
long
as
unlawful
doesn't
mean
violation
of
a
penal
code
provision
and
so
long
as
it
doesn't
mean,
as
the
commonwealth
is
suggesting,
that
there
has
to
be
--
that
the
defendant
would
have
to
first
demonstrate
that
the
police
were
seized
in
order
to
be
able
to
convincingly
argue
that
the
search
was
unreasonable.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
i
can't
--
i
can't
think
of
one,
your
honor.
ms.
jamesa
j.
drake
well,
the
factual
record
in
this
case
is
fully
developed,
and
how
a
reasonable
person
would
interpret
the
scenario
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
which
--
this
court
would
review
the
decision
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
in
that
regard
de
novo
anyway.
in
that
regard,
it's
no
different
than
any
other
case
that
makes
its
way
to
this
court
where
this
court
is
asked
to
review
the
record,
make
a
determination
of
how
an
ordinary
person
would
interpret
the
officers'
conduct.
it
is
simply
unreasonable
and
unlawful
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment
for
an
officer
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
has
the
authority
of
a
warrant
when
he
doesn't
have
one.
and
when
that
prompts,
as
it
obviously
would,
an
occupant
of
a
home
to
move,
and
then
that
movement
is
used
as
evidence
that
exigent
circumstances
exist
and
warrantless
search
is
justified,
if
this
court
were
to,
you
know,
adopt
the
framework
the
commonwealth
is
arguing
for,
the
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
would
be
the
rule.
so
we
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court.
