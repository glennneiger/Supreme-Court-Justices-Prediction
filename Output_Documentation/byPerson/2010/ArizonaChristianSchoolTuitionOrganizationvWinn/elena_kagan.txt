justice
elena
kagan
so
if
you
are
right,
general
katyal,
the
court
was
without
authority
to
decide
walz,
nyquist,
hunt,
mueller,
hibbs,
this
--
this
very
case,
just
a
few
years
ago?
that
the
court
was
out
of
authority
to
decide
any
of
those
cases,
but
somehow
nobody
on
the
court
recognized
that
fact,
nor
did
the
sg
recognize
that
fact?
the
sg
participated,
i
believe,
in
each
of
those
cases.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
bickett,
could
you
explain
something
to
me
just
--
i
have
been
puzzling
and
puzzling
over
this
scheme.
can
you
tell
me
why
arizona
adopted
this
sort
of
scheme
rather
than
the
more
typical
tuition
voucher
scheme?
in
other
words
tuition
voucher
schemes
the
state
just
gives
the
voucher
or
scholarship
or
what
have
you.
this
is
so
much
more
complicated
and
complex
and
unusual.
and
it
just
left
me
wondering
why
it
was
chosen
or
what
the
state
thinks
the
advantages
of
it
are
now?
justice
elena
kagan
could
i
try
justice
kennedy's
question
in
a
slightly
different
way.
i'm
assuming
that
you
would
agree
that
if
this
was
just
a
straight
tuition
voucher
program,
the
state
could
not
give
tuition
vouchers
on
the
basis
of
religion,
could
not
say,
if
you
are
a
catholic
you
don't
get
these
tuition
vouchers.
but
what
the
state
has
done
here,
apparently,
is
to
set
up
a
scheme
that
uses
intermediaries
that
can
make
exactly
that
distinction,
that
can
say,
sorry,
if
you
are
a
catholic
you
don't
get
scholarships
out
of
our
sto.
and
the
question
is
why
should
the
state
be
able
to
do
that?
if
the
state
can't
do
it
itself
in
providing
tuition
vouchers,
why
should
the
state
be
able
to
set
up
a
system
using
intermediaries
that
exist
for
no
other
reason
than
to
administer
this
program
that
can
make
those
distinctions?
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
plaintiffs
contend,
the
plaintiffs
contend
and
this
is
a
motion
to
dismiss,
so
we
have
to
accept
their
contentions
as
settled,
that
there
are
stos
that
make
these
distinctions
that
clearly
would
be
impermissible
if
the
state
administered
the
program.
these
are
not
preexisting
charitable
organizations.
they
are
not
preexisting
schools.
they
are
entities
that
are
set
up
solely
for
the
purpose
of
administering
this
program,
and
yet
the
state
is
saying
it
can
make
distinctions
that
the
state
itself
cannot.
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
are
saying
--
you
are
saying
both,
is
that
right,
mr.
bender?
you're
saying
both
of
those
things?
justice
elena
kagan
could
i
ask
you:
is
there
--
do
you
understand
the
beneficiaries
of
this
program?
has
the
state
said
who
the
beneficiaries
of
this
program
are?
are
the
beneficiaries
of
this
program
the
parents,
or
are
the
beneficiaries
of
this
program
the
general
taxpayers?
justice
elena
kagan
so
i
would
assume,
then,
if
the
beneficiaries
of
the
program
are
the
parents,
then
it's
the
parents
who
have
to
be
treated
equally
without
regard
to
religion.
justice
elena
kagan
general
katyal,
flast
could
not
have
meant
that
it
is
your
particular
dollar.
there
would
be
no
way
to
know
it's
your
particular
dollar
and
that
would
be
a
silly
and
fictional
thing
to
say
as
the
plurality
opinion
in
hein
makes
clear.
what
flast
said
was
that
taxpayer
dollars,
not
your
dollar,
but
taxpayer
dollars,
are
going
to
this
activity
in
the
same
way
that
it's
going
to
the
activity
here.
justice
elena
kagan
flast
talk
about
a
nexus
the
way
justice
breyer
said
and
here
is
a
taxpayer
challenging
a
provision
of
the
tax
code,
an
active
pursuant
to
the
tax
and
spending
power
that
grants
a
tax
benefit.
that's
as
close
a
nexus
as
you
are
going
to
get
using
the
language
of
flast.
