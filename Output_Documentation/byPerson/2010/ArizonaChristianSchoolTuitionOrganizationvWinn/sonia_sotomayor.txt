mr.
katyal,
their
point
is
that
this
tax
money
does
belong
to
the
state
that
private
individuals
are
using,
because
it
is
money
that,
even
by
the
new
amendment,
says
either
you
pay
it
to
the
state
or
you
use
it
for
this
purpose,
but
it's
the
state's
money
and
it's
giving
you
by
its
largesse
the
right
to
redirect
it.
that's
their
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
would
be
the
taxpayers'
tax
dollars
being
spent
on
religion,
if
they
could
sustain
their
claim.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
limits
the
funding.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
complaint.
you
just
said
to
justice
breyer
that
your
complaint
was
that
the
stos
are
giving
scholarships
based
on
the
student's
religion.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
another
part
of
your
complaint
was
that
the
stos
were
giving
just
to
the
religious
schools.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
to
attend
that
school?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
essence
of
your
complaint
is
that
some
of
the
stos
are
requiring
that
the
recipient,
the
recipient
child,
be
of
a
particular
religion?
