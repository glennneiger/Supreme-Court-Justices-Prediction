ms.
paula
s.
bickett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
arizona's
tuition
tax
credit
does
not
violate
the
establishment
clause,
because
it's
a
neutral
law
that
results
in
scholarship
programs
of
private
choice.
it's
neutral
because,
like
the
tax
deduction
that
the
court
upheld
in
mueller,
it's
one
of
many
tax-saving
devices,
including
some
26
other
credits
that
are
available
to
arizona
taxpayers
on
a
neutral
basis.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
yes,
justice
kagan.
one
of
the
things
that
is
true
in
arizona
that
was
not
true
in
ohio
is
that
under
the
arizona
constitution
any
direct
aid
to
private
schools
is
prohibited.
the
other
thing
about
the
tax
credit
program
is
that
it
does
encourage
contributions
not
only
from
parents
but
from
the
community
at
large.
and
this
then
provides
money
for
low-income
students,
students
from
low-income
families.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
could
you--
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
--your
honor,
of
course
it
was
at
a
motion
to
dismiss
phase.
what
the
record
shows
is
that
there's
some
reports
that
--
studies
that
have
been
done
that
show
that
there
have
been
some
children
that
have
switched
from
public
schools
to
private
schools
as
a
result
of
the
program,
that
many
of
the
scholarship
programs
are
--
in
fact,
most
of
the
scholarship
programs
provide
scholarships
based
on
financial
need.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
well,
what
the
record
shows
is
that
there
have
been
--
there
is
a
large
amount
of
contributions.
there
is
$55
million.
it
doesn't
--
we
have
arizona
department
of
revenue
reports
that
list
the
number
of
contributors
and
who
contributes
--
or
not
the
individuals
who
contribute.
i
--
it
doesn't
specifically
line
out
who
the
contributors
are,
whether
they
are
parents
or
whether
they
are
not
parents.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
right.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
again,
the
record
doesn't
show
what
the
size
of
the
contributions
are.
it
shows
the
number
of
contributions
and
the
total
amount
of
contributions.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
programs
are
programs
of
private
choice,
because
any
aid
that
reaches
religious
schools
does
so
after
only
after
at
least
four
levels
of
private
decisionmaking.
arizona
sets
up
the
neutral
rules
for
the
--
this
tax
credit,
and
after
that
private
individuals
and
organizations
take
over.
anyone
can
form
a
school
tuition
organization,
and
the
increase
in
the
number
and
diversity
of
school
tuition
organizations
over
the
13
years
that
the
tax
credit
has
been
in
existence
demonstrates
infact
that
this
is
free
for
everyone
to
participate
in.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
under
the
tax
credit
program--
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
--the
schools
have
to
be
qualified
private
schools
in
order
to
participate
in
the
tax
credit.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
primarily
what
it
is,
is
that
private
schools
in
arizona
satisfy
the
compulsory
education
law
as
long
as
they
meet
the
requirements
that
the
public
schools
have
in
terms
of
providing
qualitatively
the
subject
matter
that
the
public
schools--
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
excuse
me?
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
justice
breyer,
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
problem
with
private
schools
in
arizona
and
certainly
not
that
have
participated
in
this
tax
credit
program.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
if
it
was
--
if
it
was
a
private
institution--
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
--and
so
that
is
a
private
organization.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
as
long
as
there
was
not
a
federal
law
that
applied
to
the
organization--
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
--unless
the
discrimination
could
be
attributed
to
the
state,
the
state's
direction,
then--
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
yes,
they
do.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
no,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
well,
your
honor,
because
stos
are
501--
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
--because
they
are--
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
--yes,
your
honor.
the
court
held
that
the
department
of
revenue
could
preclude
the
university
from
having
tax-exempt
status
because
that
violated
public
policy,
and
therefore
they
were
not
entitled
to
501(c)(3)
status.
and
so
too
here,
all
of
these
organizations
are
501(c)(3)
organizations,
so
they
would
not
be
able
to
discriminate
based
on
race.
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
your
honor,
the
state
is
not
making
those
decisions.
it's
private
organizations.
and
anyone
can
set
up
a
school
tuition
organization.
school
tuition
organizations
that
support
solely
secular
schools
are
in
existence
and
there
has
been
no
problem
setting
those
up.
five
of
the
top
ten
stos
do
provide
scholarships
to
any
school
of
the
parents'
choosing--
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
--your
honor,
if
i
might
correct
you,
there
was
one
school
tuition
organization
that
preexisted
the
tax
credit,
and
certainly
the
private
schools
that
participated
in
these
for
the
most
part
did
exist
before
this
school
tuition
organization.
what
this
program
allows
private
organizations
to
do,
it
allows
parents
to
get
together
with
private
schools
and
form
school
tuition
organizations
that
then--
ms.
paula
s.
bickett
--before
this
scheme
was
created,
they
would
have
gotten
a
tax
deduction,
a
federal
tax
deduction
and
a
state
tax
deduction
instead
of
a
tax
credit.
but
the
difference
--
there
is
not
a
significant
difference
between
a
tax
credit
and
a
tax
deduction
in
terms
of
constitutionality.
the
only
difference
between
a
tax
deduction
is
that
for
purposes
of
a
tax
deduction
it
depends
on
--
the
value
of
it
depends
on
the
tax
bracket
of
the
taxpayer,
whereas
a
tax
credit,
the
value
depends
--
is
equal
for
all
taxpayers
that
owe
taxes.
and
this
court
has
never
made
a
distinction
between
tax
credits
on
the
one
hand
or
tax
exemptions
or
tax
deduction.
under
respondents'
theory,
any
money
that
the
government
doesn't
take
in
would
then
be
the
equivalent
of
state
money
and
that
would
then
undermine
501(c)(3)
corporations
and
all
kinds
of
charitable
organizations.
what
you
need
to
look
at
in
--
when
arizona
decided
to
give
a
tax
credit
for
this
is
it
was
thinking
is
this
a
worthy
public
purpose
to
not
take
in
certain
money
that
--
that
the
state
would
normally
be
entitled
to
if
they
give
contributions
to
that
purpose.
so,
it's
not
a
question
--
and
that
--
that
type
of
purpose
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
walz,
in
hernandez.
and
there,
again,
there
is
not
a
basis
for
distinguishing
here
between
what
arizona
is
doing
and
other
501(c)(3)
organizations
that
have
for
years
been
able
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
tax
savings,
tax
benefits,
and
help
give
scholarships
to
religious
organizations.
