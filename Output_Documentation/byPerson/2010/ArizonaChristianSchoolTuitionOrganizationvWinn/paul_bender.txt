mr.
paul
bender
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
with
mr.
katyal's
statement
that
if
we
win
this
case
you
don't
get
any
relief
because
as
much
money
would
go
into
religious
education
as
goes
now.
that
shows
he
does
not
understand
our
claim.
our
claim
is
not
that
money
is
going
--
that
state
money
is
going
to
religious
schools.
our
claim
is
that
state
money
is
being
given
to
the
beneficiaries
of
a
state
spending
program
on
the
basis
of
religion.
it's
a
claim
about
discrimination
in
the
distribution
of
these
stated
funds.
mr.
paul
bender
i
didn't
say
it
favored
or
disfavored
religion.
mr.
paul
bender
the
problem
is
that
government
benefits
in
a
government
benefit
program
cannot
constitutionally
be
given
to
the
beneficiaries
of
the
program
on
the
basis
of
their
religion.
if
a
parent
comes
to
one
of
these--
mr.
paul
bender
--let
me
try
to
clarify.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
you
must
not.
you
must
give
the
money
to
the
beneficiaries
without
taking
the
beneficiaries'
religion
into
account.
suppose
the
government
set
up--
mr.
paul
bender
--because
the
stos
are
giving
out
government
funds.
the
stos
are
on
the
government's
behalf
distributing
tax
revenues.
suppose
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
sto
--
most
money
is
given
out
by
stos
that
do
care
whether
it
goes
to
a
religious
school.
mr.
paul
bender
that
doesn't
matter.
if
the
state's
grantee
cares,
that's
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
bender
i
believe
the
court
held
the
opposite
in
bowen,
where
the
decision
to
use
the
money
for
religious
purposes
was
made
by
the
grantee,
not
made
by
the
government.
the
government
program
in
bowen
was
completely
religiously
neutral.
grantees
were
given
funds
to
educate
adolescents
in
sexuality.
the
court
held
--
and
chief
justice
rehnquist
wrote
the
opinion
--
that,
although
the
program
was
constitutional
on
its
face
because
--
it
wasn't
unconstitutional
because
religious
organizations
could
participate
as
grantees.
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
those
organizations
distributed
the
benefits
of
the
program
on
the
basis
of
religion.
think
about
a
head
start
program.
suppose
the
government
sets
up
50
head
start
programs
in
a
particular
community.
they
are
all
run
by
private
organizations,
some
religious,
some
not.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
same
as
here,
yeah.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
understand.
in
bowen
i
think
the
court
held,
in
the
as-applied
part
of
bowen,
that
if
the
grantees
were
to
give
out
their
services
on
the
basis
of
religion
that
would
violate
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
think
we
do
know
that
and
the
complaint
alleges
that,
but
that's
not
the
point.
the
point
is
not
what
the
religious
schools
do,
the
point
is
what
the
stos
do.
the
stos
are
government
grantees.
they
are
distributing
government
funds.
the
constitution
prohibits
organizations
that
distribute
government
funds
as
part
of
a
government
spending
program
to
do
it
on
the
basis
of
religion.
mr.
paul
bender
this
is
money
that
the
government
takes
from
people.
mr.
paul
bender
but
it's
money
that's
raised
by
the
state's
income
tax.
every
tax-credited
dollar
is
a
dollar
that
has
to
be
paid
either
to
the
government
as
income
taxes
due
or
to
an
sto.
mr.
paul
bender
but
it
does
take
it.
mr.
paul
bender
the
money
--
no,
it's
not.
with
respect,
justice
kennedy,
the
money
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
money
that
is
generated
by
imposition
of
the
state's
income
tax,
not
by
non-imposition
of
it.
if
there
were
no
state
income
tax
there
would
be
no
tax
credit
program.
mr.
paul
bender
would
i
say
what
about
the
tax
deduction?
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
wouldn't
because
a
tax
deduction--
mr.
paul
bender
--because
when
a
taxpayer
makes
a
charitable
deduction,
that
charitable
deduction
is
made
from
the
taxpayer's
money.
at
the
time
the
taxpayer
makes
that
deduction,
the
taxpayer
can
do
anything
he
wants
with
that
money.
that's
not
true
of
this
tax
credit.
at
the
time
this
tax
credit
is
taken,
the
taxpayer
owes
the
government,
let's
say,
$5,000
in
state
income
taxes.
you've
got
to
pay
that
$5,000.
you
can't
keep
it.
it's
not
your
money.
it's
not
that
all
of
your
money
is
the
government's
money;
it's
that
this
$5,000
that
you
owe
the
government
as
income
taxes
is
the
government's
money.
mr.
paul
bender
it
doesn't
turn
on
whether
it's
valuable
or
not.
it
turns
on
whether
when
the
taxpayer
makes
the
payment
the
taxpayer
is
paying
the
taxpayer's
own
money
or
money
the
taxpayer
owes
to
the
government.
when
you
make
a
charitable
contribution,
you
are
using
your
own
money.
that's
not
money
you
owe
to
the
government.
you
don't
know
how
much
money
you
owe
to
the
government
until
you
figure
out
your
taxes.
this
credit
doesn't
come
into
play
until
you
figure
out
your
taxes.
and
then
if
you
owe
the
government--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
difference
is
--
that
--
to
me
the
broad
difference
is
that
the
tax
deduction
is
given
for
charitable
contributions.
and
i
think
the
court
would
decide
if
it
faced
the
question
--
i
don't
think
it's
ever
had
to
--
that
it
is
constitutional
for
the
government
to
support
private
charity.
and
if
the
government
is
going
to
support
private
charity
by
letting
you
deduct
charitable
contributions,
it
can't
leave
religious
charities
out
of
that
program.
that
would
violate
the
establishment
clause.
so
if
you
believe
that
the
charitable
deduction
in
the
federal
income
tax
is
the
constitutional
thing
for
the
government
to
do,
to
support
private
charity
by
picking
up
part
of
the
tab
--
that's
true
when
there
is
a
deduction
--
then
you
have
to
give
the
deduction
to
people
who
contribute
to
religion.
so,
yes,
there
is
a
government
support
for
that
private
charitable
contribution,
but
it's
a
charitable
contribution.
the
money
in
this
case
is
not
a
charitable
contribution.
mr.
katyal
says
that
it's
not
the
government's
money.
whose
money
is
it?
is
it
the
taxpayer's
money
who
gives
the
$1,000
contribution?
no.
if
you
don't
take
my
word
for
it,
look
at
what
the
stos
say
on
their
web
sites
about
this
program.
one
of
them
says
quite
frankly:
hey,
you
can
give
charity
with
someone
else's
money;
it's
a
miracle.
another
one
says:
it
won't
cost
you
anything;
you
can
give
charity
with
other
people's
money.
mr.
paul
bender
whose
money
is
it?
mr.
paul
bender
no.
mr.
paul
bender
i
do
not.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it
isn't,
justice
alito.
my
argument
is
that
if
the
government
imposes
an
income
tax,
and
people
owe
the
government
a
certain
amount
of
money
in
income
taxes
due,
that
--
and
the
government
says
you
don't
have
to
pay
it
to
us,
you
can
pay
it
to
a
sto,
that
that
is
a
payment
of
government
funds.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
not
a
contribution.
mr.
paul
bender
i
--
i
disagree
with
that.
i
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--if
you
look
at
the
arizona
income
tax
form
it
says:
here's
your
income.
apply
the
tax
rate
to
the
income.
here
are
your
taxes
due.
$5,000.
you
may
pay
that
in
part
by
giving
$1,000
--
by
paying
$1,000
to
an
sto.
you
are
paying
your
taxes.
when
taxpayers
take
this
$1,000
credit--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
[laughter]
mr.
paul
bender
this
is
a
government
spending
program.
is
there
any
doubt
about
that?
the
money
in
this
program
is
not
private
charitable
contributions.
mr.
paul
bender
the
difference
is
that
in
zelman
the
money
went
to
the
parents
without
any
religious
discrimination.
religion
was
not
involved
in
the
distribution
of
the
money
to
the
parents.
the
parents
in
zelman
got
funds
based
on
their
financial
need
and
the
fact
that
their
children
went
to
school
in
cleveland,
which
was
a
failing
school
district.
and
the
program
was
to
give
them,
based
on
their
financial
need,
was
to
give
them
a
voucher.
in
giving
a
parent
a
voucher,
nobody
said
to
the
parent,
what's
your
religion?
nobody
said
to
the
parent,
are
you
going
to
send
your
child
to
a
religious
school?
the
court
said
as
clearly
as
it
could
in
zelman
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
bender
the
sto
who
gives
them
the
scholarship.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
exactly,
exactly.
most
of
the
money--
mr.
paul
bender
--true.
mr.
paul
bender
let
me
--
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way,
justice
scalia.
suppose
the
government
in
this
case
gave
the
money
to
the
sto's
directly
itself,
and
the
sto's
then
gave
out
the
scholarships.
would
it
be
constitutional
for
an
sto
to
say
to
a
parent
who
comes
asking
for
a
scholarship,
are
you
catholic?
if
you're
not,
we
won't
give
you
a
scholarship.
mr.
paul
bender
what's
the
difference?
mr.
paul
bender
no.
it's
not
a
parent,
by
the
way.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
not
a
parent,
by
the
way,
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
before.
parents
under
this
program
are
not
allowed
to
give
contributions
for
scholarships
for
their
own
children.
the
people
who
get
the
--
who
can
claim
the
tax
credit,
the
person
who
gets
the
scholarship
cannot
be
a
dependent
of
the
person
who
gives
the--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes.
we
only
challenge--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes.
mr.
paul
bender
we
allege
that
the
stos
that
give
out
the
majority
of
the
funds
--
i
think
now
it's
about
70
percent
of
the
funds
--
that
the
stos
that
give
out
a
majority
of
the
funds
only
give
the
funds
to
parents
who
will
send
their
child
to
a
religious
school--
mr.
paul
bender
--designated
by
the
sto.
mr.
paul
bender
that
depends
on
the
sto
you
go
to.
some
of
the
stos--
mr.
paul
bender
--exactly.
mr.
paul
bender
we
allege
they
exist
and
no
one
doubts
that.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
stos
don't
give
scholarships
to
religious
schools.
they
give
scholarships
to
parents.
the
parents
are
awarded
the
scholarships,
not
the
schools.
mr.
paul
bender
to
attend
that
school,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
that,
and
some
of
the
stos
are
also
requiring
that
in
order
to
get
the
scholarship
the
parent
agree
to
send
the
child
to
a
particular
religious
school.
mr.
paul
bender
both
of
them,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
the
beneficiaries
of
this
program
are
the
parents
and
children.
that's
what
this
program
is
for.
the
state
set
up
a
program
to
help
parents
send
their
children
to
non-public
schools,
and
to
do
that,
they
are
going
to
give
them
scholarships.
scholarship
money
is
going
to
be
made
available.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
right.
exactly.
the
parent
that
--
the
scholarships
--
as
zelman
said
as
clearly
as
it
could,
the
scholarships
have
to
--
in
that
case,
the
vouchers
have
to
be
available
to
parents
on
a
religiously
neutral
basis.
the
scholarships
are
not
allowed
to
be
made
available
to
parents
according
to
their
religion
or
according
to
whether
they
will
send
their
child
to
a
religious
school.
both
of
those
kinds
of
discrimination
are
going
on
here.
i
think
there--
mr.
paul
bender
--exactly.
right.
yes.
it's
not
the
taxpayers'
money.
it's
confusing
because
we
are
talking
about
two
kinds
of
taxpayers
here.
we
are
talking
about
my
clients,
who
are
general
taxpayers,
whose
money
is
being
used
to
fund
this
program,
and
we
are
talking
about
the
taxpayers
who
take
the
tax
credit.
we
have
two
different
kinds
of
taxpayers.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
justice
alito.
i
think
it
would
be
constitutional
if
it
said
you
get
a
deduction
for
making
a
charitable
contribution
to
an
educational
organization,
and
that
can
include
a
religious
educational
organization,
because
if
it
didn't,
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
you
can't
set
up
a
program
that
gives
you
a
deduction
for
giving
to
an
educational
institution
but
not
to
a
religious
organization.
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
if
you
are
going
to
support
private
charity,
you
have
to
support
religious
charity
in
the
same
way
you
support
non-religious
charity.
but
if
you're
going
to
have
somebody--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
may
have
misunderstood
her
question.
i
think
her
question
was:
at
the
time
the
taxpayer
makes
the
charitable
contribution
that
he
is
going
to
take
a
deduction
for,
the
taxpayer
could
do
anything
he
wants
with
that
money.
he
can
take
a
vacation.
he
can
give
it
to
a
charity.
he
could
buy
clothes
with
it,
buy
food
with
it.
it's
a
completely
open
system.
nobody
tells
the
taxpayer
what
he
has
to
do.
in
this
case,
when
the
taxpayer
writes
that
check
to
the
sto,
the
taxpayer
can't
keep
that
money.
can't
use
it
on
a
vacation,
can't
use
it
for
buying
food.
has
to
either
pay
it
to
the
state
or,
with
the
state's
authorization,
pay
it
to
an
sto.
mr.
paul
bender
there
is
nothing
unconstitutional
about
the
taxpayers
sending
the
money
to
an
sto.
if
stos
did
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
religion
in
giving
that
money
out,
there
would
be
no
unconstitutionality.
mr.
paul
bender
if
the
government
said
to
you:
you
can
pay
your
taxes
--
don't
pay
your
taxes
to
us,
pay
them
to
a
church,
and
the
church
gave
its
benefits
only
to
people
of
a
certain
religion,
i
believe
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it's
the
difference
between
charity
and
paying
your
taxes.
when
you
make
a
charitable
contribution,
you
are
making
a
charitable
contribution.
it
costs
you
money.
in
arizona,
if
you
make
a
charitable
contribution
of
$1,000,
it
costs
you
$950
if
you
are
at
the
maximum
tax
rate,
because
the
maximum
tax
rate
is
5
percent.
in
arizona,
if
you
take
this
tax
credit,
it
costs
you
nothing.
it's
not
charity.
charity
is
something--
mr.
paul
bender
--contributions
to
stos
are
deductible
from
one's
income
tax?
mr.
paul
bender
no,
we
would
not
have
a
problem
with
that.
mr.
paul
bender
of
course.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
it
would
be
true
only
if
the
top
marginal
rate
were
90
percent,
which
is
never
going
to
happen
in
arizona,
believe
me.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
going
in
the
other
direction.
mr.
paul
bender
i
understand.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
because
that's
still
charity.
if
the
top
rate
is
90
percent,
when
you
give
that
money,
it's
your
money;
you
can
use
it
for
anything
you
want.
and
even
if
you
are
in
the
90
percent
bracket,
you
are
giving
some
of
your
own
money.
you
are
engaging
in
charity.
and
the
constitution,
i
think,
permits
the
government
to
subsidize
private
charity.
and
if
the
government's
going
to
subsidize
private
charity,
it
can't
leave
religious
charities
out.
so
that's
the
dividing
line.
is
the
government
subsidizing
private
charity?
in
this
case,
the
government
is
not
subsidizing
private
charity
because
it
is
not
private
charity,
because
the
tax--
mr.
paul
bender
--because
it's
perfectly
okay
to
use
government
money
for
non-religiously
discriminatory
purposes.
you
can
get
a
tax
credit
for
buying
a
solar
water
heater.
that
is
a
100
percent
tax
credit.
now,
that's
a
somewhat
different
kind
of
tax
credit,
because
there,
when
you
buy
the
heater,
you
get
something
for
the
money.
it's
--
this
tax
credit
is
a
very
strange
kind
of
tax
credit.
this
is
a
tax
credit
that
is
only
used
to
pay
your
taxes.
that's
the
only
function
it
has.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
no,
no.
if
an
sto
discriminates
either
by
saying
we
only
give
to
people
of
a
certain
religion
or
we
don't
give
to
people
of
another
religion
or
by
saying
we
will
only
give
you
a
scholarship
if
you
send
your
kid
to
a
religious
school
that
we
designate.
mr.
paul
bender
i
hope
i
didn't.
mr.
paul
bender
thank
you
for
correcting
me.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
get
your
hypothetical.
mr.
paul
bender
it
depends
on
who
the
beneficiaries
of
the
government--
mr.
paul
bender
--i'm
not
clear
on
your
program.
if
it's
a
government
program
to
benefit
hospitals,
the
benefits
have
to
go
to
hospitals
on
a
religiously
neutral
basis.
mr.
paul
bender
but
the
hospitals
are
the
beneficiaries,
justice
breyer,
that's
the
difference.
the
beneficiaries
here
are
not
the
sto's,
the
beneficiaries
here
are
the
parents.
the
sto's
are
a
conduit
of
government
funds
to
the
parents.
the
parents
are
the
beneficiaries
and
the
constitution
requires
that
the
benefits
of
a
government
spending
program
go
to
the
beneficiaries
on
a
religiously
neutral
basis.
so
in
zelman
the
beneficiaries
were
the
parents,
and
the
vouchers
had
to
go
to
them.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
if
the
hospitals
are
the
beneficiary
of
the
program,
then
the
hospitals
have
to
get
the
money
on
a
religiously
neutral
basis.
mr.
paul
bender
the
analogy
would
be
the
patients
are
the
beneficiaries
of
the
program.
the
government
wants
to
help
cancer
patients,
and
so
it's
going
to
give
money
to
hospitals
to
help
cancer
patients,
so
it
gives
money
to
various
hospitals
under
justice
breyer's
program.
if
one
of
those
hospitals
says
we
only
treat
catholic
cancer
patients,
that's
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
bender
if
i
go
to
get
a
scholarship
from
an
organization
and
they
say
where
are
you
going
to
send
your
child
with
this
scholarship?
and
i
say
i
haven't
made
that
decision
yet.
and
they
say
well,
we
will
only
give
you
a
scholarship
if
you
send
your
child
to
a
jewish
school
which
teaches
people
how
to
pray
in
the
way
jewish
people
pray
and
has
--
and
it's
education
is
jewish
religious
education.
that's
religious
discrimination.
