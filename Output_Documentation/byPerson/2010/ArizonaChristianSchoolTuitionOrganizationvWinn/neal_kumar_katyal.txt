mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
13
years,
arizona
has
permitted
private
citizens
to
contribute
money
to
private
organizations
set
up
by
private
individuals
and
has
let
those
organizations
use
that
money
towards
scholarships
when
individuals
apply
for
them.
the
ninth
circuit
erred
first
in
finding
that
the
taxpayer
plaintiffs
had
standing,
and
second
in
striking
the
program
down.
on
standing,
this
lawsuit
fails
each
of
the
three
necessary
elements.
regarding
injury
in
fact,
the
key
point
is
this:
not
a
cent
of
the
respondent's
money
goes
to
fund
religion.
if
you
placed
an
electronic
tag
to
track
and
monitor
each
cent
that
the
respondent
plaintiffs
pay
in
tax,
not
a
cent,
not
a
fraction
of
a
cent,
would
go
into
any
religious
school's
coffers.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
one
has
to
do
with
injury
in
fact.
the
other
has
to
do
with
redressability.
with
respect
to
injury
in
fact,
our
point
is
as
you
track
the
taxpayers'
dollars,
it
doesn't
actually
fund
any
religious
program,
unlike
the
--
unlike
flast
and
other
cases
in
which
this
court
has
considered
taxpayer
standing
for
religion.
their
complaint
is
not
that
the
government
is
spending
money
that
the
taxpayers
have
--
money
that
has
been
extracted
and
spent
of
the
taxpayers.
their
complaint
is
that
someone
else's
money
is
not
being
extracted
and
spent
enough.
and
the
relevant
language
in
flast
says
that
for
taxpayer
standing
to
occur,
it's,
quote,
"his
tax
money"
must
be
extracted
and
spent,
and
here
that
is
not
occurring.
now,
with
respect
to
the
other
argument,
not
injury
in
fact
but
addressability
and
causation,
our
point
is
this:
it's
speculative
as
to
whether
or
not
that
chain
of
events
that
you
spelled
out,
justice
sotomayor,
would
actually
happen.
as
this
court
said
in
cuno,
for
example,
when
a
tax
credit
is
given
sometimes
that
actually
reduces
the
amount
of
money
the
government
has
to
spend.
it
doesn't
increase
it.
and
so
that's
different
than
the
direct
outlay
that
was
at
issue
in
flast.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
let
me
say
two
things
about
that.
first
is:
that
is
not
all
that
different,
justice
breyer,
than
what
we
have
today
with
501(c)(3)
deductions.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
don't
think
that
any
taxpayer
could
challenge
that.
that
is,
depending
on
the
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
i'm
not
sure
if
the
government
is
specifying
which
religious
organizations
might
be
eligible
for
the
check
box.
but
if
the
government
is
doing
something
that
is
underinclusive
and
only
giving
tax
credits
to
one
set
of
religious
organizations,
that's
a
texas
monthly
problem,
as
this
court--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--no,
justice
breyer.
two
things
on
that.
first
is:
we
are
only
talking
about
standing,
not
the
merits.
and
with
respect
to
standing,
if
the
government
funded
only
religious
organizations
or
religious
prayer,
i
do
think
that
other
organizations
would
have
standing
--
not
as
a
taxpayer,
because
this
court
has
been
very
careful
in
flast
and
in
hein
to
say
there
is
an
extremely
narrow
exception
for
taxpayer
standing,
a
narrow
exception
to
frothingham,
but
other
organizations
would
have
texas
monthly
standing
because
they're--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
way
this
scheme
is
set
up,
our
answer
is
no.
and
i
think
that
accords
with
this
court's
general
reluctance
to
confer
taxpayer
standing
in
this
area.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
don't
see
that,
justice
ginsburg,
in
flast.
i
think
flast
is
a
very
narrow
exception
for
when
someone's
dollars
are
being
taken
out
of
their
pocket
and
spent
by
the
government
on
religion,
and
i
don't
think
that's
happening
here.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
breyer--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
flast
is
gone
at
all
when
there
is
direct
government
outlays
to
spend
on
religion
like
flast.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
do
think
that
that
can
get
around
it,
that
can
get
around
it
in
some
circumstances,
and
again,
those
who
are
underincluded
in
a
government
program
may
have
standing,
not
as
a
taxpayer.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
justice
breyer,
if
that's
the
result,
that's
the
result
for
every
other
clause
in
the
constitution.
taxpayer
standing
is
the
most
narrow
of
exceptions,
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
don't
see
that
in
flast,
justice
ginsburg,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
i
think
this
court
in
valley
forge
was
very
clear
to
say
that
if,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
you
can't
find
a
plaintiff
with
standing,
that
is
not
an
excuse
to
relax
the
--
our
general
requirements
of
article
iii
standing.
and
here,
if
you
granted
the
plaintiff
standing,
what
you
would
be
granting
is,
for
the
first
time,
a
tax
credit
which
is
a
complaint
about
someone
else's
money
not
being
spent
to
a
high
enough
level.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
so
let
me
say
two
things
about
that.
first
is,
i
do
think
it
is
very
much
just
like
frothingham,
in
which
frothingham
had
to
deal
with
this
exact
problem.
the
court
had
conferred
standing
in
taxpayer
standing
case
after
taxpayer
standing
case
and
then,
when
it
was
teed
up
and
presented
to
the
court
as
a
question
about
article
iii
standing,
the
court
said:
no,
we
shouldn't
have
granted
taxpayer
standing
in
those
cases.
so
my
answer
to
you
is
yes.
now,
i
do
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
hein
i
think
reiterated
some
of
the
fundamental
principles
and
the
limits
on
flast.
and
i
think
the
court
--
the
plurality
made
quite
clear
that
it
would
go
no
further
than
the
facts
of
flast.
and
to
grant
standing
here,
you
have
to
go
--
tremendously
depart
from
what
flast
is
about:
a
direct
government
outlay
of
funds
out
of
--
taking
money
out
of
someone's
pocket
to
fund
religion.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
they
could
have
gone
out
--
the
results
may
have
been
the
same.
it
just
would
have
been
--
would
have
been
on
standing
instead
of
on
the
merits.
mueller,
for
example,
upheld
the
programs.
so
the
bottom-line
decision
would
have
been
the
same,
but
the
way
in
which
the
court
got
there
would
have
been
so
that
there
was
no--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--no
taxpayer
--
no
taxpayer
standing.
now,
there
may
have
been
other
forms
of
standing,
texas
monthly
standing,
that
could
have
been
alleged
to
challenge
those
programs,
yes.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
did,
and
in
the
first
footnote--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
first
footnote
in
the
brief,
justice
ginsburg,
acknowledged
the
fact
that
standing
hadn't
been
pushed
or
pressed
below.
but
i
acknowledge
that,
particularly
in
the
wake
of
hein,
should
another
case
arise,
the
government
will
--
will
acknowledge
the
standing
defects
and
brief
them
as
we
are
here.
our
point
on
redressability
is
not
simply
that
the
--
that
the
tax
--
that
the
cost
of
the
program
is
speculative.
it's
also
that
the
relief
that
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
in
this
case
won't
redress
their
problem.
that
is,
if
you
gave
the
plaintiffs
everything
they
are
asking
for,
the
very
same
religious
schools
and
the
very
same
religious
stos
would
continue
to
be
funded.
the
very
same
religious
stos
would
continue
to
be
funded
because
they
would
leave
in
place
--
and
this
was
my
answer
to
justice
breyer
--
the
tax
deduction,
the
501(c)(3)
tax
deduction.
so
there
would
still
be
government
revenue
being
spent
in
favor
of
these
religious
stos
under
their
program.
it
would
just
be
at
the
level
of
one-third
instead
of
100
percent.
i
don't
think
that
satisfies
their
problem.
i
don't
think
james
madison's
remonstrance
would
be
satisfied
if
madison
were
told:
well,
you're
not
going
to
be
taxed
three
pence,
you
will
be
taxed
one
pence.
the
principle
is
what
matters,
the
principle
of
flast.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you.
my
friend
said,
i
think
i
have
this
right,
"we
are
talking
about
my
clients
whose
money
is
being
used
to
fund
this
program.
"
that's
a
nice
description
of
flast.
it
is
not
a
description
of
what's
going
on
here.
flast
recognized
a
special
--
special
solicitude
for
taxpayers
when
money
is
taken
out
of
their
pocket
and
used
to
fund
religion
against
their
conscience.
here,
even
if
you
accept
all
of
this
public
money
discussion
that
has
been
happening,
not
a
cent
of
their
money
is
going
to
fund--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
breyer,
two
things.
first,
the
relevant
language
in
flast
is
at
page
106,
it's
not
what
the
nexus
test,
it's
the
definition
of
what
the
actual
tax
payer
claim
is
and
it
requires
that
"his
tax
money
being
extracted
was.
"
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
that's
the
general
description
flast
says
about
how
taxpayer
standing
will
go
forward.
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
that,
valley
forge
makes
that
clear
because
the
dissenters
said
exactly
what
you
said,
which
is
look,
let's
just
look
to
economic
effects
and
that
alone
will
be
enough
and
it's
just
property
clause,
tax
and
spending
clause,
it
doesn't
really
matter,
it's
the
bottom
line
on
the
treasury
and
this
court
said
no,
that
isn't
the
case.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
disagree
--
first
is
i
don't
think
that
is
what
flast
is.
i
think
flast
is
about
that
micro-fraction
of
a
cent
that
is
coming
from
your
pocket
and
being
used
to
fund
religion.
and
that
is
what
madison
complained
about,
it
may
be
very
small,
it
may
be
3
cents,
but
there
is
a
special
harm
of
conscious
when
it's
your
money,
your
hard
earned
money
being
used
to
fund
a
program
directly
as
to
which
you
don't
like.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
again,
i
think
that
doesn't
deal
with
the
direct
injury
on
the
taxpayer,
which
is
the
language
of
flast.
even
if
you
disagree
with
me,
the
harm
here
is
a
lot
more
speculative,
just
like
cuno,
because
you
have
to
posit
in
order
for
the
harm
to
exist
to
this
taxpayer,
that
tax
credits
will
cost
the
government
money,
not
save
it,
that
his
tax
burden
will
go
up
as
opposed
to
someone
else's
tax
burden,
a
corporation
and
the
like,
or
you
have
to
posit
that
the
government
won't
cut
spending
in
order
to
make
up
the
shortfall
in
revenues
that
he
says
is
going
to
exist.
you're
going
to
have
to
do
all
of
those
things,
none
of
which
you
have
to
do
in
a
flast
situation
because
it's
a
direct
outlay
of
funds.
if
i
could
just
can
spend
a
moment
on
justice
kennedy's
question
about
state
action,
which
of
course
they
didn't
advance
below
as
the
ninth
circuit
said.
i
think
it's
this
court's
precedence
are
quite
clear
in
saying
that
the
fact
that
the
government
regulates
or
funds
something
doesn't
transform
it
into
a
state
actor.
if
it
did,
then
all
501(c)(3)'s
would
become
state
actors,
and
that,
i
think,
would
be
an
enormously
damaging
precedent
for
this
court
to
follow.
rather,
i
think
what
blum
says
is
that
it
requires
the
performance
of
a
traditional
executive
prerogative
--
additional
government
prerogative
and
here
all
the
sto
is
doing
is
funding
--
it's
handing
out
money
and
it's
doing
so
on
a
neutral
basis,
anyone
can
form
an
sto,
and
anyone
can
fund
one.
