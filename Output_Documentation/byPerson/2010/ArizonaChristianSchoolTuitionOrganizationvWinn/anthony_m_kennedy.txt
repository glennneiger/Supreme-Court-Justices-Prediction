justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
heard
your
answer
to
the
--
you
said
your
answer
is
yes.
in
other
words,
you
agree
with
justice
kagan's
criticism
of
those
cases
and
you
said,
yes,
she's
right;
those
cases
were
wrongly
decided.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
would
have
said
there
would
have
been
no
standing
in
those
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
record
show
the
extent
to
which
there
are
donations
by
people
who
do
not
have
students?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
record
show
the
extent
to
which
there
are
these
additional
donations
that
you
just
referred
to?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
an
sto
--
this
is
a
hypothetical
case
--
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race.
no
hispanic
or
no
white
or
no
black
can
receive
our
money.
suppose
there
is
no
federal
statute
on
it,
no
state
statute
prohibiting
it.
would
there
be
a
constitutional
violation,
a
federal
constitutional
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
an
sto.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
there
are
no
attributes
of
state
action
that
would
suffice
to
allow
a
discriminated
person
to
bring
suit,
a
person
who
has
been
discriminated
against?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
hypothetical
is
no
federal
statute,
no
state
statute.
it's
a
state
action
question
is
what
i'm
asking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
you
think
a
strong
argument
can
be
made
that
it
can
be
attributed
to
the
state.
the
state
has
all
sorts
of
rules
about
what
an
sto
has
to
be.
the
state
provides
the
mechanism
through
the
credit
for
the
funding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
--
what
about
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
saying
the
sto
--
you
are
saying
the
stos
are
sufficiently
private
so
they
can
do
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'll
--
i'll
give
you
credit,
mr.
bender.
in
your
brief
you
say
if
you
are
wrong
on
that
point
that
you
are
folding
your
tent
and
leaving,
there's
--
that
there
is
no
standing
and
that
there's
no
--
no
violation.
but
i
must
say,
i
have
some
difficulty
that
any
money
that
the
government
doesn't
take
from
me
is
still
the
government's
money.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you.
if
--
if
you
reach
a
certain
age,
you
can
get
a
--
a
card
and
go
to
certain
restaurants
and
they
give
you
10
percent
credit.
i
think
it
would
be
rather
offensive
for
the
cashier
to
say,
"and
be
careful
how
you
spend
my
money.
"
[laughter]
but
that's
the
whole
point
of
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
arizona
tax
code
allows
private
individuals
to
claim
dollar-for-dollar
state
tax
credits
for
contributions
to
school
tuition
organizations,
and
these
are
called
stos.
the
stos,
school
tuition
organizations
use
the
private
contributions
to
provide
scholarships
to
students
attending
private
schools,
and
these
include
religious
schools.
a
group
of
arizona
taxpayers
sued
the
director
of
the
arizona
department
of
revenue.
the
taxpayers
contend
that
the
arizona's
sto
tax
credit
constitutes
a
subsidy
of
religion
in
violation
of
establishment
clause
principles.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reached
the
merits
of
that
argument.
it
concluded
that
the
taxpayers
had
stated
a
valid
claim
under
the
establishment
clause.
we
now
reverse.
the
court
cannot
reach
the
merits
of
taxpayers
establishment
clause
claims
unless
it
finds
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
resolve
the
dispute.
and
an
essential
element
of
federal
jurisdiction
is
the
requirement
that
the
parties
have
standing.
they
must
show,
not
only
that
they've
suffered
an
actual
injury
that
was
caused
by
the
illegal
action
complained
of,
but
also
that
the
injury
would
be
remedied
by
a
judicial
decree.
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
standing
is
a
necessary
ingredient
if
any
case
or
controversy
appropriate
for
resolution
in
federal
court.
case
and
controversies
are
constitutional
terms
that
define
an
article
iii
jurisdiction.
respondents
contend
that
they
have
standing
to
maintain
this
action
for
one
and
only
one
reason,
because
they
are
arizona
taxpayers.
but
the
mere
fact
that
someone
is
a
taxpayer,
does
not
normally
establish
standing.
in
general,
people
do
not
have
a
continuing
legal
interest
in
ensuring
that
their
tax
payment
--
payments
are
spent
in
a
lawful
manner,
and
this
principle
is
well
settled.
now,
to
overcome
that
general
rule
against
taxpayer
standing,
respondents
rely
on
an
exception,
and
the
exception
is
contained
in
a
opinion
announced
by
this
court
in
1968,
that's
the
case
of
flast
versus
cohen.
under
flast,
individuals
suffer
a
particular
injury
when
in
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
and
by
means
of
the
tax
code,
their
property
is
transferred
through
the
government's
treasury
to
a
sectarian
entity.
and
as
the
flast
court
put
it,
"the
taxpayers'
allegation
in
such
cases
would
be
that
his
tax
money
is
being
extracted
and
spent
in
violation
of
specific
constitutional
provisions
against
such
abuses
of
legislative
power."
flast
recognized
that
under
the
first
amendment's
establishment
clause,
taxpayers
suffer
a
unique
injury,
a
violation
of
conscience,
when
their
funds
are
extracted
and
spent
in
service
of
an
establishment
of
religion.
here,
the
respondents
are
taxpayers.
the
sto
tax
credit
does
not
extract
and
spend
their
funds
in
service
of
an
establishment.
rather,
the
taxpayers
are
free
to
pay
their
own
tax
bills.
they
could
also
contribute
to
a
religious
or
secular
sto
of
their
choice,
or
they
could
obtain
a
different
tax
credit
by
making
a
different
charitable
contribution.
the
sto
tax
credit
is
not
tantamount
to
a
religious
tax.
the
court's
opinion
today
concludes
that
the
taxpayers
also
fail
to
satisfy
the
other
requirements
for
article
iii
standing.
sto
contributions
result
from
the
decisions
of
private
taxpayers
regarding
their
own
funds.
as
a
result,
any
injury
the
objectors
may
suffer
would
not
be
fairly
traceable
to
the
state.
and
the
court
order,
prohibiting
operation
of
the
sto
tax
credit,
would
not
affect
respondents
or
their
tax
payments.
because
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
taxpayers'
lawsuit,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
reversed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
justice
kagan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
breyer,
and
sotomayor
joined.
