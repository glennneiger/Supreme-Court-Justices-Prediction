general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
ms.
bickett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
only
get
--
if
you
give
a
million
dollars,
you
still
only
get
a
$500
tax
credit,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bender.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
this
take
the
beneficiaries'
religion
into
account
when
the
program
works
perfectly
in
exactly
the
same
way
if
it's
a
nonreligious
school?
they
don't
care
whether
it's
a
religious
school
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i'm
trying
--
i
don't
think
that
was
my
--
i
hope
that
wasn't
my
question.
it's
how
is
it
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
religion
if
the
stos,
the
government
money,
it
doesn't
care
whether
it
goes
to
a
religious
school
or
not.
it's
treated
the
same?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
state
money
going
to
the
sto,
the
state
doesn't
care
whether
it
goes
to
a
religious
sto
or
a
secular
sto.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
we've
held
that
when
you
have
the
decision
is
made
by
a
private
entity
whether
to
use
the
money
to
go
to
a
religious
school
or
a
nonreligious
school,
that
that
doesn't
violate
the
constitution
because
the
decision
is
not
made
by
the
state,
it
is
made
by
the
private
recipient.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
could
we
get
--
just
to
get
back
to
bowen
for
a
moment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
entities
that
were
distributing
the
funds
could
be
private
or
religious?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
entities
in
bowen
were
not
identified.
the
recipients
of
the
state
funds
were,
as
here,
they
weren't
identified
as
religious
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
excuse
me.
just
to
follow
up
on
justice
scalia's
question,
because
i
want
to
make
sure
we
have
the
answer:
if
this
system
were
set
up
exactly
as
it
is
now,
but
arizona
said
contributions
to
stos
are
deductible,
you
would
have
no
problem?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
only
difference
is
that
arizona
set
up
this
system
where
you
get
a
tax
credit
instead
of
a
tax
deduction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
the
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question.
his
question
was,
you
give
it
to
the
hospital
equivalent
of
the
sto
and
then
that
gives
it
to
hospitals
on
a
religiously
discriminatory
basis.
why
aren't
the
hospitals
the
beneficiaries
of
that
program
just
as
you
say
the
parents
are
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
katyal,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
