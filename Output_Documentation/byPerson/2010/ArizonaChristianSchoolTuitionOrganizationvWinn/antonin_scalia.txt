you
haven't
--
i
don't
think
you
answered
his
question.
the
question
was,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
whether
any
of
the
money
that's
involved
here
comes
not
from
parents,
but
rather
from
others
who
can
contribute
to
the
program?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
if
some
of
the
contributions
are
considerable,
like
a
million
dollars,
that
couldn't
be
just
a
parent,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
contributions
of
that
size?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
those
standards
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
program.
they
are
standards
that
any
private
school,
religious
or
otherwise,
must
meet
in
order
to
satisfy
the
education
requirements
of
arizona?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
there
is
a
tax
deduction
for
contributions
to
churches?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
many
churches
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
religion,
don't
they.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
pose
a
constitutional
problem,
do
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
is
a
discrimination,
i
get
it.
the
school
that
seems
to
get
the
most
money
on
the
list
doesn't
appear
to
be
a
religious
school
at
all.
it's
not
even
discrimination
between
religion
and
non-religion,
if
you
think
that
that
is
invalid,
which
i
don't.
but
it
doesn't
favor
religion
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
what's
your
problem
under
the
establishment
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
have
a
government
program
that
gives
out
money
indiscriminantly
to
certain
organizations
that
say
provide
hospital
services,
and
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
that
included
organizations
that
were
religious
organizations,
as
well
as
organizations
that
were
not.
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
must
positively
disfavor
religion?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
that
the
schools
here
do
that?
there
are
some
religious
schools.
do
we
know
that
these
religious
schools
do
not
admit
people
except
of
a
certain
religion?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
great
leap
to
say
that
it's
government
funds,
that
any
money
the
government
doesn't
take
from
me
because
it
gives
me
a
deduction
is
government
money.
i
mean,
that's
the
first
leap
you
make.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
money
has
never
been
in
the
government's
coffers.
the
government
has
declined
to
take
this
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
don't
owe
it
to
the
government
if
they
have
made
this
contribution.
that's
the
whole
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
owe
the
tax
to
the
extent
that
they
have
given
money
to
one
of
these
institutions.
you
--
you
say
--
you
posit
at
the
very
beginning
that
you
owe
a
full
amount
of
tax.
that
is
just
not
true.
you
don't
owe
the
tax
if
you've
made
the
$500
contribution.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
owe
the
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
problem;
they
have
to
revise
their
form.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
government
money
you
claim
is
at
issue
here
is
--
is
the
money
that
the
contributor
to
the
sto
has
failed
to
give
to
the
government
when
it's
the
government's
money.
now,
that
decision,
of
whether
to
give
the
money
to
an
sto
or
not,
whether
to
give
it
to
a
religiously
affiliated
sto
or
a
nonaffiliated
one,
that
is
in
the
hands
of
a
private
individual,
just
as
the
voucher
program
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
--
there
is
no
religious
discrimination
in
that
choice.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
not,
but
you
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
an
intervening
parent
or
contributor.
and
it's
that
person
who
is
making
the
decision
of
whether
to
give
it
to
a
religious
or
nonreligious
organization;
it
isn't
the
government
making
that
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
was
the
same
thing
in
zelman.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
get
you
there.
that
doesn't
get
you
there,
as
justice
breyer's
interrogation
indicated.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
thing
is
true
of
charitable
deductions.
when
you
take
a
charitable
deduction,
you
don't
have
the
money
anymore.
you
have
given
it
to
a
charitable
organization.
now,
you
are
allowed
to
give
it
to
a
particular
religion,
a
particular
church,
and
there
seems
to
be
nothing
unconstitutional
about
that,
right?
so
what
is
unconstitutional
here
about
the
private
--
the
private
decision
to
give
a
benefit
to
a
--
an
organization
that
only
supports
particular
schools,
and
indeed,
only
supports
people
of
a
particular
religion
to
go
to
that
school?
i
don't
see
any
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
churches
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
religion.
when
i
take
my
charitable
deduction
to
give
it
to
a
particular
church,
that
church
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
religion,
but
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
how
the
government
puts
it?
so
it
really
is
just
that
line
in
the
tax
form
that
you
are
concerned
about,
and
the
only
relief
you
really
need
is
--
is
changing
the
tax
form?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
the
opposite
earlier,
i
thought
you
said
the
opposite
earlier.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
you
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
other
issue.
we
are
trying
to
separate
in
your
argument
the
issue
that
some
of
these
organizations
are
religiously
affiliated
from
the
argument.
that
moreover,
they
will
only
give
money
to
individuals
of
a
particular
religion.
now,
i
understand
your
argument
for
the
latter,
but
i
must
say
i
don't
understand
your
argument
for
the
former.
not
if
you
accept
these
other--
