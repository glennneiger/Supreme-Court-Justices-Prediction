then
is
it
constitutional
if
we
get
a
new
system?
here's
what
the
system
will
be:
the
taxpayers
who
are
religious
will
be
able
to
check
a
box
and
the
check
that
they
send
to
the
irs
--
it's
a
possible
system
--
what
happens
is
that
that
check
is
cashed
by
an
official
and
the
cash
is
given
to
the
local
priest
to
say
prayers
for
the
individual
who
contributed
the
money.
and
in
your
view,
there
is
no
one
who
could
challenge
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
difference
is,
of
course,
that
in
the
one
case
it's
a
deduction
and
in
this
case
you
are
paying
it
100
percent
with
money
that
would
otherwise
go
into
the
coffer.
i
understand
that.
but
i
am
interested
in,
conceptually,
does
the
government
think
that
there
is
no
one
who
could
challenge
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
go
back
into
history,
it
could
have
been
the
case
that
the
--
as
long
as
they
were
fair
to
every
religion,
the
first
congress
could
have
funded
prayers
throughout
the
nation
in
churches
for
anyone
to
go
and
pray
and
that
would
not
have
violated
the
establishment
clause,
or
if
it
had,
nobody
could
have
challenged
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
flast
is
gone;
is
that
right?
flast
is
gone.
there
is
no
more
--
there
is
nothing
more
to
flast,
because
it
just
happened
that
nobody
had
thought
of
this
system
at
the
time
of
flast.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
had,
they
could
have
--
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
there
needn't
be,
because
all
you
have
to
do
to
get
around
it
is
to
create
what
we
have
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
something
that
worried
me
in
zelman
is
this,
and
i
might
get
your
answer.
probably
arizona
spends
some
billions
of
dollars
on
public
schools,
doesn't
it?
i
don't
know
what
the
exact
amount
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
take
30
or
40
percent
of
that
and
spend
it
through
this
program
on
religious
schools.
imagine
that
happens.
at
that
point
people
might
get
into
considerable
discussion
about
what
qualifies,
when
it
doesn't
qualify,
whether
it's
a
balanced
school
or
is
it
just
teaching
religion,
and
what
the
rules
and
regulations
are.
how
is
arizona
dealing
with
this
problem?
by
saying
there
are
no
regulations,
by
saying
that
we're
not
--
is
there
a
system
for
dealing
with
the
legitimacy
and
circumstances
under
which
a
particular
religion's
schools
qualify
for
this
program?
who
decides
and
how?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
must
be
a
set
of
regulations
and
rules.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
when
do
they
teach
the
religion
part
of
their
program?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
when
does
a
private
school
--
normally
the
schools
--
i'm
not
an
expert,
but
what
you
have
to
do
to
be
a
school
is
a
very
complex
thing,
and
you
have
all
kinds
of
requirements
that
eat
up
quite
a
lot
of
the
day.
and
i
just
wonder
how
the
religion
part
fits
in.
has
there
turned
out
to
be
no
problem?
when
do
they
--
do
they
teach
religion
at
6:00
in
the
morning?
does
it
matter
if
the
person's
qualified?
how
does
the
--
i
once
had
a
case
on
this
in
the
first
circuit
and
it
came
out
to
be
surprisingly
complex,
and
i
just
wondered
how
--
if
there
turned
out
to
be
any
problem
at
all
in
arizona
in
this
area.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
assume
that
it
is
a
--
i
see
your
argument
there.
now,
in
zelman
the
holding,
i
would
think
--
which
i
was
not
in
agreement
with,
but
it's
now
law
--
that
government
can
have
a
--
a
spending
program.
and
what
they
did
was
the
government
spent
money
in
the
form
of
vouchers
to
be
given
to
private
individuals
to
use
for
such
education
as
they
wish,
that
met
certain
standards,
including
religious
schools.
so
what's
the
difference
between
the
program
here
and
the
one
that
was
held
constitutional
in
zelman?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
who
here
says
to
the
parent
who
is
going
to
the
school,
what
is
your
religion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
the
sto
gives
the
scholarship
only
to
catholics
to
go
to
catholic
schools--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--only
to
jews
to
go
to
jewish
schools?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
they
change
one
rule
and
the
rule
that
the
stos
had
was
this,
they
said:
we
will
give
you
tuition
if
you
otherwise
qualify
for
your
child
to
go
to
the
school
that
you
wish
to
go
to,
and
if
you
are
jewish
or
you
are
protestant
and
you
want
to
go
to
st.
joseph's
catholic
school,
that's
absolutely
fine,
they
won't
kick
you
out,
and
vice
versa.
now,
in
your
opinion
that
then
would
be
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
is
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
only
thing
you
are
challenging
is
the
rule
that
they
will
not
--
the
stos
will
not
give
the
scholarship
to
a
protestant
to
go
to
a
catholic
school.
how
do
we
know
they
would
--
that
that
is
the
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
ah,
but
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
different.
you
were
complaining
about:
i'm
jewish;
i
want
my
child,
let's
say,
to
go
to
st.
joseph's;
and
--
so
now,
do
i
qualify
or
not?
the
only
thing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--your
--
your
complaint
is
only
with
the
stos
that
wouldn't
let
you
send
the
child.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
know
that
they
exist
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
problem
with
that?
that
is
to
say,
suppose
that
the
government
gives
its
money
to
put
cat
scans
in
hospitals.
and
it
has
certain
beneficiaries.
and
one
group
of
beneficiaries
is
the
association
of
catholic
hospitals,
another
is
the
association
of
jewish
hospitals,
another
is
a
set
of
totally
secular
hospitals.
so
it
gives
the
tax
credits
to
all
three.
now,
of
course
the
catholic
group
is
going
to
give
it
to
catholic
hospitals
and
so
forth.
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
do
is
they
have
government
money,
just
like
you
claim
this
is,
and
they
say
we
are
going
to
give
it
to
umbrella
organizations
like
the
association
of
catholics,
jewish
or
secular
hospitals
and
we
expect
them
to
distribute
it.
and
they
will,
of
course,
distribute
it
to
those
who
are
their
members
and
in
some
cases
their
members
are
religious
organizations
and
in
some
cases
they
are
not.
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
what
happens
here,
leaving
the
student
out
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
beneficiaries
of
the
government,
catholic
hospital
--
government
cat
scan
program
will
be
catholic
hospitals,
because
they're
the
ones
who
belong
to
the
catholic
hospital
association.
money
will
also
go
to
the
secular
hospital
association,
as
it
goes
to
a
secular
sto
here.
so
i
don't
see
that
part.
that's
the
last
prong
that
we
are
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
government
says
--
that's
the
different
--
the
government
says
--
it
does
give
the
money
away
on
a
religiously
neutral
basis,
it
gives
it
to
hospital
associations.
it
turns
out
that
some
of
those
naturally
are
supposed
to
give
it
to
their
members,
all
of
whom
will
be
religiously
affiliated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
flast,
i
looked
at
again
briefly,
and
it
seemed
to
use
that
wonderfully
precise
word
nexus.
and
you
are
quite
right
that
in
flast
that
was
the
case.
but
why
isn't
it,
given
that
it
is
a
nexus
in
flast,
what
was
in
flast,
why
isn't
it
also
a
nexus
where
you
have
this
complicated
system
which
is
designed
to
make
the
ordinary
taxpayer
pay
a
little
more
in
this
kind
of
instance,
where
what
you've
done
is
directly
subtract
from
the
treasury
$5,000
cash
to
turn
over,
in
the
view
of
the
plaintiffs,
to
a
purely
forbidden
religious
purpose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
that
in
that
instance
in
flast
--
does
flast
rule
out?
