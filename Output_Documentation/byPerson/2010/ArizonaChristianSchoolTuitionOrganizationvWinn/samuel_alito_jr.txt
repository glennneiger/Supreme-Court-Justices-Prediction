justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
a
tax
deduction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
it's
the
government's
money?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
because
they
are
kind
enough
to
give
me
a
tax
deduction
--
because
they
are
kind
enough
to
give
the
taxpayer
a
deduction
for
certain
contributions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
isn't
this
true
of
a
tax
deduction
also?
and
this
is
a
very
modest
tax
credit.
the
tax
deduction
that
a
wealthy
person
would
get
by
making
a
contribution
to
a
college
or
university
that
has
a
religious
affiliation
is
much
more
valuable
than
this
$500
credit.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
completely
don't
understand
that.
somebody
does
know.
it's
december
31st.
they
know
--
they
figure
out
how
much
tax
they
are
going
to
have
to
pay
for
that
year.
they
know
exactly.
they
can
know
exactly
what
their
taxes
will
be.
and
it
will
be
x,
and
if
they
make
a
--
a
deduction,
then
it
will
be
x
minus
y.
what
is
the
difference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
difference
does
it
say
on
their
web
sites?
there
is
a
very
important
philosophical
point
here.
you
think
that
all
the
money
belongs
to
the
government--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--except
to
the
extent
that
it
deigns
to
allow
private
people
to
keep
some
of
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
doesn't
take
it
by
taxes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
what
your
whole
argument
is
based
on.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
that
it's
a
deduction
before
the
line.
this
is
a
major
lawsuit?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
arizona
had
a
statute
that
gave
an
income
tax
deduction
only
to
individuals
who
make
charitable
contributions
to
educational
institutions,
there
would
be
a
problem
there,
because
they
--
it
wasn't
a
general
tax
exception
for
charitable
contributions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
ginsberg
was
the
difference
between
this
and
the
federal
tax
deduction
for
charitable
contributions
was
that
the
federal
tax
deduction
is
available
for
a
broad
range
of
charities,
whereas
this
is
available
only
for
a
very
narrow
range.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that
would
be
true
if
even
if
the
--
if
the
top
marginal
rate
was
90
percent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
federal
rate
has
been
that
high--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--at
times.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
what
the
establishment
clause
terms
on
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
this
is
government
money,
then
why
would
it
be
constitutional,
in
your
view,
for
this
scheme
to
exist
if
--
for
the
--
if
the
stos
did
not
discriminate
at
all
on
the
basis
of
religion?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
have
stos
that
say:
we
will
only
give
scholarships
for
religion
affiliated
schools,
but
we
will
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
the
student's
religion.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
this
is
the
government's
money
you
think
that
would
not
be
an
establishment
clause
violation?
