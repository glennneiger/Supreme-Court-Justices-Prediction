justice

bader

counsel,
does
anyone
have
standing,
in
your
view,
to
challenge
this
scheme?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
we
leave
out
the
fine
points
that
you
were
discussing,
isn't
the
underlying
premise
of
flast
v.
cohen
that
the
establishment
clause
will
be
unenforceable
unless
we
recognize
taxpayer
standing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
a
plaintiff
--
we
have
a
bill
of
rights
and
most
provisions
have
plaintiffs
who
are
hurting,
whose
speech
is
being
suppressed,
but
this
one
doesn't
have.
it's
in
the
constitution
like
all
the
others,
and
i
thought,
to
be
candid,
that
that's
what
the
problem
was
in
flast
v.
cohen,
and
that's
what
the
court
was
responding
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
--
i
don't
remember
whether
the
government
participated
in
the
winn
case
when
it
came
up
under
the
tax
injunction
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
wasn't
a
word
from
the
government
about
lack
of
standing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
case
in
this
court,
the
name
of
it
was
bob
jones.
it
was
a
private
school
and
it
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race.
and
the
question
was
whether
they
could
have
tax-exempt
status
so
that
there
could
be
donations
to
them.
do
you
remember
the
outcome
of
that
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
there
was
an
sto
before
this
program,
but
it
didn't
get
the
benefit
of
money
from
taxpayers.
that
would
have
gone
--
that
money
went
to
--
to
arizona,
not
to
the
sto
before
this
scheme
was
created.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bender,
can
i
go
back
to
your
point
--
you
were
making
a
distinction
between
a
taxpayer
who
makes
a
charitable
donation.
well,
that
taxpayer
has
the
whole
universe
to
spend
it
on:
buying
clothes,
on
gambling,
on
this
charity,
that
charity.
but
your
point
here
is
that
this
contributor
does
not
have
the
universe
to
pick
and
is
free
to
pick
the
charity.
this
one
has
--
you
either
give
it
to
the
government
or
you
give
it
to
the
sto.
is
that--
