mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
vermont
statute
protects
important
interests
that
the
vermont
legislature
could
recognize
in
physician
autonomy
and
control
over
information
that
concerns
them.
when
a
patient
brings
a
prescription
to
a
pharmacy,
after
that
point
the
patient
information
is
protected
under
hipaa
and
under
state
law.
that
leaves
two
primary
actors
in
that
transaction
--
the
physician
and
the
pharmacy.
both
are
professionals,
both
are
subject
to
regulation
under
a
comprehensive,
closed
system
for
the
distribution
of
drugs.
prior
to
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted,
the
pharmacy
had
complete
control
over
the
disposition
of
that
information.
what
this
statute
does
is
put
the
physician,
the
prescriber,
on
an
equal
footing
with
respect
to
the
pharmacy
--
with
the
pharmacy,
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
information
about
that
prescriber,
but
only
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
information
in
marketing
to
that
prescriber.
it
is
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
that
enables
the
physician,
not
the
state,
enables
the
physician
to
determine
whether
the
information
that
he
was
required
to
furnish
in
connection
with
the
prescribing
of
a
drug
will
be
used
in
the
marketing
of
products
to
that
--
to
that
physician.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it's
because
it's
a
prescription
drug.
federal
and
state
law
require
a
prescription
for
a
prescription
drug.
but
if
this
was
not
a
prescription
drug,
a
person
can
go
into
a
drug
store
and
purchase
a
nonprescription
drug
just
like
any
other
item
in
a
drug
store,
not
have
to
furnish
the
name,
not
have
to
furnish
any
of
this
information.
so
the
information
is
furnished
because
of
the
requirement
of
a
prescription
which
is
of
long
standing.
so
this
statute
is
really
of
a
piece
with
a
--
with
a
number
of
other
types
of
regulations
to
protect
--
protect
privacy,
for
example,
the
driver's
privacy
protection
act,
where
a
person
is
required
to
furnish
certain
information
in
order
to
get
a
driver's
license.
that
statute
prohibits
the
commercial
exploitation
of
that
information.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
--
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
that's
--
the
term
"privacy"
is
used
to
embrace
that
sort
of
autonomy
and
control
over
information.
that's
--
that's
the
way
in
which
we're--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
he
certainly
does--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he
--
he
certainly
--
he
certainly
does
care
about
that.
and
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
are
other
--
there
are
other
principles
that
protect
it.
the
--
the
--
the
state's
pharmacy
regulations
require
pharmacies
to
maintain
the
confidentiality--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
well
--
it
--
it
--
it's
a
lesser
version
of
that,
a
less
restrictive
version
of
that,
because
it
doesn't
put
either
the
pharmaceutical
company
or
the
physician
in
the
position
of
an
all-or-nothing
situation.
what
--
what
the
law
allows
is
the
physician
to
--
to
say,
you
can
--
you
can
come
visit
me,
but
i
don't
want
you
to
use
this
information
that
has
otherwise
been
kept
confidential
under
pharmacy
rules
to
market
to
me.
that
enables
the
physician
to
choose
to
have
what
the
physician
may
choose
--
may
see
as
a
more
objective
presentation.
it
puts--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
he
--
if
he
doesn't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
--
if
he
doesn't
want
to
talk
to
the
--
to
the
detailer
at
all.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
what
this
allows
for
--
physicians
see
value
to
this,
but
what
this
allows
for
is
for
the
physician
to
say:
i
don't
want
my
information
to
be
used
by
this
drug
company
in
a
way
--
sort
of
inside
information
about
my
overall
prescribing
practices.
i
would
--
i
would
prefer
to
have
a
presentation
made
to
me
without
the
information
about
me,
but
information
about
the
drugs
that
might
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
--
it
does
not,
but
that's
--
that's
common
in
--
in
--
in
confidentiality
statutes.
for
example,
hipaa,
which
protects
the
personal
information
of
--
of
persons
in
the
health
care
system,
that
information
can
be
used
and
frankly
would
have
to
be
used,
for
example,
for
paying
insurance
claims.
the
insurer
needs
to
know
what
prescriptions
or
what
other
medical
services
might
have
been
provided.
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
insurers
controlling
their
costs,
because
there
are
formularies
and
preferred
drug
lists.
and
so,
people
in
that
position
necessarily
have
to
be
able
to
use
prescriber
information
in
order
to
find
out
whether
--
whether
something
was
suitably
prescribed
under
the
preferred
drug
list.
so,
it
--
it's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
what
the
statute
does
is
allow
the
physician
--
or
the
prescriber
to
make
that
choice.
it's
information
about
the
prescriber
that
the
prescriber
was
required
to
furnish
in
connection
with
issuing
a
prescription.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and
--
and
--
and
again,
that
--
that's
true
in
a
variety
of
--
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
--
not
--
not
altogether,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
no
confidentiality
interest
or
no
autonomy
or
control
interest,
because
a
physician
practicing
medicine
knows
that
his
patient's
insurer
is
going
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
that
would
not
be
--
that
would
not
be
permissible.
it
would
not
be
germane
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
a
very
broad
goal.
i
mean,
here
--
here
what
the
state
has
done
is
--
is
put
the
control
in
the
physician,
who
is
a
critical
player
in
the
--
in
the
delivery
system.
so
it's
narrowly
tailored
to
the
physician's
use
of
the
information
about
him
in
--
in
connection
with
how
--
how
he
will
be
approached.
it's
also
important
to
recognize
that
this
is
very
different
from
the
general
advertising
cases
this
court
has
had
under
the
commercial
speech
doctrine.
this
is
not
public
advertising.
this
i
think
falls
into
the
camp
of
dun
and
bradstreet,
where
you
have
a
--
a
targeted
limited
business
audience,
a
--
a
--
really
one-on-one.
it's
not
--
it's
not
radio
or
television
advertising.
it's
one-on-one
advertising
in
which
the
public
interest
is
--
is
much
more
limited,
and
it's
one-on-one
with
respect
to
the
very
person
whose
information
was
first
furnished
by
the
physician
to
the
pharmacy,
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
allowing
the
other
person
to
that
representation
visit
to
decide
whether
information
about
him,
not
other
information;
about
him
--
will
be
used
in
that
situation.
it's
very
much
like
a
don't
--
a
"do
not
call"
statute
or
a
"do
not
mail"
statute,
in
which
people
have
the
right
to
say:
do
not
contact
me
for
commercial
information,
except
this
one
is
more
limited.
this
one
says--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--do
not
use
information
about
me
to
contact
me.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
you
could
post
a
sign
saying
"no
solicitations",
and
i
think
under
this
court's
cases
that
--
that
sort
of
protection--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
i
think
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
i
think
the
state
could
--
could
enact
a
law
that
said
if
someone
posts
a
sign
saying
do
not
--
do
not
approach
me,
do
not
knock
on
my
door
for
this
purpose--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
they
don't
want
to
talk
at
all.
but
this
--
but
this
--
this
is
--
this
is
addressed
to
a
more
limited
problem
and
therefore
is
more
narrowly
tailored,
which
is
that
it
--
what
--
what
--
what
the
pharmaceutical
company
can't
do
without
the
physician's
consent
is
to
--
is
to
use
information
that
was
gathered
about
that
very
individual
to
approach
him.
it
puts
--
it
puts
the
physician
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
pharmacy
at
the
--
at
the
beginning
of
the
--
of
the
stream
of
commerce,
it
puts
the
physician
on
--
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
pharmacy
or
the
pharmaceutical
company
at
the
other
end
by
saying:
i'm
going
to
keep
that
information
about
me
to
myself
if
you'll
--
if
you
are
approaching
me.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
may
i
answer
--
answer
the
question?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
--
it
is
in
the
possession
of
the
pharmacy.
but
what
the
state
has
done
is
to
legitimately
recognize
that
the
physician
has
a
stake
in
some
of
the
information
on
that
list,
and
in
that
respect
the
list
is
a
--
is
a
commodity.
the
state
is
regulating
its
commodity
aspect,
not
its
communicative
or
expressive
aspect,
in
--
in
this
statute.
