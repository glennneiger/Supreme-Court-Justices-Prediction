ms.
bridget
c.
asay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
state
and
federal
law,
doctors
write
prescriptions
for
their
patients
to
allow
them
access
to
drugs
that
the
government
deems
too
dangerous
for
unrestricted
sale.
vermont's
law
allow
doctors
to
decide
whether
this
information
that
they're
compelled
to
provide
to
pharmacies
may
be
used
in
marketing
that
is
directed
at
them.
drug
companies
would
certainly
like
to
have
this
information
for
marketing,
but
they
have
no
first
amendment
right
to
demand
it,
just
as
they
have
no
right
to
demand
access
to
the
doctor's
tax
returns,
his
patient
files,
or
to
their
competitors'
business
records.
vermont's
law
does
not
regulate
the
content
of
the
marketing
pitches
and
the
advertising
that
drug
companies
provide
about
their
products
or
their
competitors'
products.
it
regulates
access
to
this
information
that's
created
in
a
highly
regulated
regime
of
prescription
drugs
and
in
the
context
of
the
doctor-patient
relationship.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
i
disagree,
your
honor.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
let
doctors
decide
whether
sales
representatives
will
have
access
to
this
inside
information
about
what
they
have
been
prescribing
to
their
patients.
and
what
--
what
the
record
shows
is
that
what
drug
companies
do
is
track
and
monitor
doctors
very
closely
to
watch
when
they
switch
drugs,
to
watch
the
trends
by
which
they
--
doctors
prescribe,
by
gender,
by
age.
and
all
that
information
is
used
to
target
and
to
direct
the
marketing
projects--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--the
pharmaceutical
manufacturers?
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
under
this
statute
they
may
use
it
for
some
limited
purposes
for
clinical
trials.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
the
purpose
is
to
allow
doctors
to
decide
whether
the--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--the
information
should
be
available.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
as
with
any
information
that
the
--
that
might
inform
a
marketing
campaign,
not
having
the
information
may
be
--
make
their
marketing
less
effective
or
make
it
different.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
again,
your
honor,
the
purpose
is
to
allow
doctors
to
make
the
decision,
and
doctors
may
want
to
allow
its
use
or
not
allow
its
use.
but
the
law--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--the
only
--
the
consent
requirement
in
this
statute
goes
to
the
use
for
marketing
and
also
to
the
sale
by
the
pharmacy,
and
that
sale
may
be
for
other
purposes
as
well,
so
there--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--your
honor,
there's
two
sort
of
answers
to
that.
the
first
is
that,
with
respect
to
pharmacies,
the
record
shows
here
that
the
only
place
that
the
pharmacies
disseminate
their
information
is
to
the
data
vendors,
and
that
is
a
commercial
sale,
and
it
is
primarily
intended
for
the
marketing
purpose.
insurers
do
have
information
about
doctors'
prescribing
practices
and
patient
information.
they
have
that
internally
from
their
own
claims
and
data
and
their
relationships
with
doctors
and
patients.
so
insurers
are
not
--
do
not
need
to
buy
the
data
from
pharmacies.
they
have
it
without
purchasing
it.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
that's
correct,
your
honor,
there
are
people
who
know
what
the
doctor
prescribes
and
what
the
patient
has
received.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
it
assures
the
prescribing
physician
that
his
information
about
prescribing
practices
will
not
be
used
for
marketing
without
his
consent.
it's
like
the
difference--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--he
could
not
achieve
the
same
result,
your
honor.
what
the
record
shows
is
that
doctors
are
particularly
concerned
about
having
access
to
the
best
information
and
the
most
complete
information
to
make
decisions
for
their
patients.
and
this
data,
as
was
discussed
by
dr.
granday
below,
by
kesselheim,
by
mr.
erhari,
the
former
sales
representative
--
they
all
discussed
how
the
data
ends
up
being
used
to
filter
the
information
that
doctors
receive.
so
they
receive
less--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--it
is
not
correct,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
respondents
have
suggested
that
vermont's
academic
detailing
program,
which
is
called
the
evidence-based
education
program,
uses
this
data.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
well,
the
statute
would
not
permit
the
sale
for
that
purpose,
which
is
a
separate
provision
of
the
statute,
because
academic
detailing
is
not
an
exemption.
they
would
also
--
and
then
the
question
of
whether
the
information
would
be
available
would
default
back
to
the
pharmacy
board
rules,
which
again--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--yes,
your
honor,
the
statute
does
permit
it
to
be
sold
for
health
care
research--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--we
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
of
the
background
regulations
that
govern
this
information,
including
pharmacy
board
rule
20,
which
we
cited
at
page
4
of
our
brief,
which
also
places
restrictions
on
disclosure
of
patient
and
practitioner--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
whether
the
question
is
about
the
data
itself
or
results
drawn
from
the
data.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
allows
the
sale
of
the
data
for
research,
the
restriction
on
the
other
uses
would
accompany
the
sale,
and--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--when
the
--
if
the
pharmacy
sold--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--right.
if
that
happened--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--the
statute
would
have
required
the
pharmacy
to
prevent
the
further
dissemination
of
the
data
except
for
health
care
research.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
i
apologize,
your
honor,
if
i
was
not
clear.
as
a
factual
matter,
we
know
absolutely
that
the
pharmacies
do
not
sell
it
to
researchers.
i
had
understood
this
to
be
a
hypothetical,
if
they
did.
but
as
a
factual
matter,
they
do
not.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
what
it
allows
the
doctor
to
do
is
to
avoid
an
intrusive
and
invasive
marketing
practice.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
the
doctor
cannot
--
can
shut
off
any
communication
and
any
information
from
the
pharmaceutical
companies
by
slamming
the
door
on
the
detailers,
but
that's
not
necessarily
in
the
interest
of
doctors
or
patients.
and
what
this--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--your
honor,
i
think
the
legislature
here
was
using
privacy
to
refer
to
the
autonomy
interest
that
everyone
has
to
some
degree
in
controlling
the
flow
or
the
use
of
information
about
them.
this
court
recognized
in
the
reporters
committee
case
in
the
foia
context
that
there
was
a
privacy
interest
in
the
aggregation
of
information
on
an
fbi
rap
sheet.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
an
opt-out
would
not
protect
the
privacy
interests
as
much
because
it
would
assume
that
doctors
want
to
consent.
i
would
like
to
say
that
here
the
statute
is--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--well,
in
fact,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
the
state
does.
every
time
that
the
doctors
relicense,
which
is
every
2
years,
they
get
a
form
and
they
can
make
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
form
that
they
receive.
so
it's
perfectly
tailored
to
allow
the
doctors
to
decide
and
to
not
restrict
any
marketing
between
a
willing
listener
and
a
willing
speaker.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
the
state
does
have
an
interest
in
reducing
health
care
costs
here.
what's
important
about
this
statute
is
the
mechanism
by
which
it
allows
doctors
to
decide
what
information
and
what
kind
of
marketing
they
want,
and
it's
different
because
what
it's
about
is
access
to
information
in
this
highly
regulated
area.
it's
the
difference
between
a
doctor
who
prescribes
a
nonprescription
drug
and
a
patient
who
can
take
that
information,
walk
into
the
pharmacy
with
a
$20
bill
and
leave
with
their
medication,
and
no
one
has
learned
anything
about
what
the
doctor
prescribed
for
the
patient,
about
the
patient's
concerns,
or
the
doctor's
concerns.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
i
disagree,
your
honor,
for
--
for
two
reasons.
the
statute
does
not
limit
any
of
the
information
that
doctors
receive.
so
the
state
has
not
in
any
way
intervened
in
the
information
that
the
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
can
provide
to
the
doctors.
they
are
free--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--i
disagree,
your
honor.
the
--
the
ability
of
drug
companies
to
locate
the
doctors
that
are
interested
in
their
products
is
--
is
not
something
that
calls
for
this
data.
it's
very--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--it's
not
a
restriction
on
speech
because
it's
a
restriction
only
on
the
access
to
the
information
that
the
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
would
like
to
use
to
inform
their
advertising,
and
it's
only
in
play
if
the
doctors
have
objected
to
the
use.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
your
honor,
it's--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--no,
i
disagree.
for
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
to
approach--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--and
--
their
speech
would
be
more
effective
if
they
had
access
to
patient
information,
if
they
had
access
to
their
competitors'
trade
secrets.
there's
certainly
other
information
available
that
they
would
like
to
use
in
marketing,
but
is
not
available
to
them
by
law,
and
it
--
it's
our
position
that
in
the
same
way
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
demand
access
to
information
about
the
doctor's
prescribing
practices
without
his
consent.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--again,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
disagree
that
the
--
the
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
consider
this
information
useful
and
helpful
in
targeting
their
marketing
campaigns.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
their
right
trumps
the
right
of
the
doctor.
and
if
you
go
back
to
--
to
the
source
of
this
information,
to
the
underlying
transaction,
the
doctor
prescribing
the
drug
for
a
patient
and
the
pharmacy
dispensing
it,
the
doctor
and
the
pharmacy
have
the
same
stake
in
that
transaction.
and
until
this
point
the
pharmacy
has
had
complete
control
over
whether
the
information
gets
sold
into
this
commercial
stream
for
marketing
use.
and
all
the
statute
does
is
put
the
doctor
on
the
same
--
in
the
same
place
as
the
pharmacy
in
terms
of
deciding
what
further
use
can
be
made
of
the
information.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
it
is
not
a
change
in
our
position.
it
is
not
an
issue
that
was
pressed
below,
because
of
the
facts
on
the
ground.
there
is
only
one
transaction
here.
there's
a
sale
from
the
pharmacies
to
the
data
vendors
for
these
commercial
purposes.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
in
our
court
of
appeals
brief,
for
example,
at
page
29
to
30,
we
describe
that
sentence
of
the
statute
as
restricting
both
the
sale
of
the
information
and
the
use
for
marketing.
and
on
page--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--it
is
my
representation
that
--
that
we
did
not
say
anything
contrary
to
that,
your
honor;
and
that
it
really
was
not
pressed
below.
so
i
would
not
say
that
we,
in
our
briefs
below,
fully
laid
out
the
position
as
the
sg
has,
but
we
did
not
disagree
with
it,
either.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
and
again,
your
honor,
if
i
could
point
also
to
pages
47
to
48
of
our
--
of
our
second
circuit
brief,
we
did
frame
the
issue
as
whether
there
was
a
right
to
buy
and
sell
prescription
records.
the
issue
has
always
been
in
the
case.
but
again
the
facts
on
the
ground,
there
has
only
been
this
one
transaction,
and
that
--
that
really
was
what
we
were
litigating
about.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
again,
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
argument
was
really
framed
clearly
below.
but
we
did
not--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--i
--
i
understand,
your
honor.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
we
did
not.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
yes,
your
honor.
we
interpret
the
first
clause
of
the
statute
to
be
a
restriction
on
sale,
except
for
sale
for
the
exemptions
that
are
set
forth
in
the
statute.
and
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute:
the
second
provision
is
a
restriction
on
the
use
for
marketing;
and
the
third
provision
is
a
restriction
that
would
apply
to
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
who
have
obtained
the
data
for
permissible
purposes
and
--
and
need
to
abide
by
the
continuing
restriction
on
the
use.
and
the
consent
provision
would
apply
to
each
of
those
parts
of
the
statute.
thank
you.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
point
that
my
friend
was
making
about
the
use
of
the
information
by
insurance
companies.
insurers
are
not
similarly
situated
to
pharmaceutical
manufacturers.
insurers
receive
information
directly
from
doctors
and
parents
in
the
ordinary
course
of
their
business
and
they
use
it
as
part
of
providing
and
paying
for
care
to
patients.
and
when
my
friend
described
the
fact
that
insurers
do
that
with
doctors'
information
as
speaker
discrimination,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
--
the
--
not
only
the
record
but
the
examples,
for
example,
that
phrma
points
to
on
page
126
their
brief
show
that
insurers
have
patient
information
for
that
purpose
as
well.
hipaa
allows
those
uses
of
both
patient
and
prescriber
information
to
manage
benefits.
so,
to
argue
that
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
are
being
discriminated
against
if
they
don't
have
access
to
the
same
health
care
information
that
we
provide
to
our
insurance
companies
would
--
would
begin
to
raise
serious
questions
about
a
statute
like
hipaa.
and
that
--
that
just
highlights
that
in
this
area
of
--
of
private
information
and
information
control
that
many
of
these
statutes
are
structured
in
such
a
way
that
there
are
expected
and
intended
and
permissible
uses
of
information,
and
other
uses
for
which
people
are
allowed
to
have
control
over
the
further
use
of
their
information.
and
here
we're
talking
about
the
control
allotted
to
doctors.
we
place
an
enormous
amount
of
trust
in
doctors
to
make
the
right
treatment
decisions
for
their
patients.
part
of
their
ability
to
make
that,
those
decisions
depends
on
the
information
that
they
receive.
and
what
doctors
have
said
to
the
vermont
legislature
and
to
the
court
in
this
case
is
that
many
of
them
find
this
practice
objectionable
and
that
it
is
not
helpful
to
them
or
to
their
patients
to
have
their
information
monitored
for
this
marketing
purpose.
and
all
that
they
have
asked
for
is
the
right
to
object.
and
i
would
like
to--
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
--thank
you,
your
honor.
the
findings,
first
of
all,
have
to
be
taken
as
they
were
adopted,
which
was
in
support
of
not
this
statute
even
as
it
was
written,
but
as
a
much
larger
bill
that
contained
many
sections,
including
a
provision
that
created
the
evidence
based
education
program
which
is
a
--
a
clinical
--
a
--
a
program
to
provide
voluntary
education
to
doctors,
and
to
the
statute
as
it
used
to
be
written,
which
--
which
not
only
had
this
provision
for
the
doctors'
choice
and
the
use
of
the
information,
but
also
mandated
that
pharmaceutical
detailers
provide
information
affirmatively
as
part
of
the
marketing
process.
ms.
bridget
c.
asay
there
are
no
findings
that
accompany
the
amendment
that
resulted
in
this
statute.
and
to
--
to
return
to,
i
think
justice
kennedy's
point
from
earlier,
the
statute,
i
think,
has
to
stand
or
fall
on
the
restriction
that
it
--
that
it
allows
for
doctors.
the
court,
for
example,
in
o'brien
discussed
the
fact
that
striking
down
a
statute
because
the
court
disagreed
with
the
record
would
--
would
simply
mean
that
the
legislature
could
adopt
the
same
statute
again
on
a
different
record.
we
would
say
here
that
what
--
what's
--
the
question
before
the
court
really
is,
may
doctors
have
this
opportunity
to
control
the
use
of
their
information
about
--
their
nonpublic
information
about
their
prescribing
practices
as
a
marketing
tool
or
not,
and
that
--
that
--
that
should
be
the
--
the
focus
of
the
court's
inquiry.
i
would
also
like
to
just
return
to
the
point
that
--
that
i
believe
i
was
making
earlier
that
this
statute
is
so
different
from
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
considered
restrictions
on
the
direct
commercial
advertising
and
the
provision
of
information
to
the
public.
this
is
an
entirely
nonpublic
commercial
transmission
of
data.
it
--
it
starts
with
a
private
commercial
transaction,
it's
a
private
commercial
exchange
between
the
data
vendors
and
the
pharmacies.
it's
used
in
a
way
that
it
is
never
disclosed
publicly,
never
included
in
the
advertising
message.
there's
no
restriction
here
on
the
information
that's
provided
to
doctors.
the
truthful
information
that
the
fda
permits
to
be
provided
about
prescription
drugs.
and
there's
no
restriction
on
any
exchange
between
a
willing
listener
and
a
willing
speaker.
i
believe
my
friend
suggested
that
--
that
anyone
could
call
a
doctor's
office
and
find
out
by
asking
what
the
doctor
prescribed.
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
can
do
that
as
well.
and
if
the
doctor
volunteers
that
information,
there
can
be
that
exchange
of
information.
the
statute
does
not
restrict
it.

don't
believe
they
can,

honor.
