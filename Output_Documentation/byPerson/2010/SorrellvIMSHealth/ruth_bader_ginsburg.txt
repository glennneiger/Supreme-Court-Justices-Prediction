ms.
asay,
are
any
of
the
other
uses,
like
for
insurance
purposes,
cases
where
the
pharmacist
is
paid
for
giving
out
the
prescriber
information?
here
what
they
call
data
miners
are
paying
the
pharmacists
to
get
this
information.
in
the
case
of
other,
others
who
have
access,
do
any
of
them
also
pay
the
pharmacists?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
clarify--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
answered
my
question
earlier
that
they
don't
sell
it
to
anyone
else.
that's
why
i
was
trying
to
clarify
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
because
you
told
me
the
only
sale
--
the
pharmacists,
they
sell
this
to
the
data
miners,
they
do
not
sell
it
to
the
other
people.
but
now
you're
answering
justice
kennedy's
question,
yes,
they
sell
it
to
universities.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
another
--
there's
another
purpose
that
i
would
like
you
to
comment
on,
and
that
is
the,
the
state
is
interested
in
promoting
the
sale
of
generic
drugs
and
correspondingly
to
reduce
the
sale
of
brand
name
drugs.
and
if
that's
the
purpose,
why
doesn't
that
run
up
against
what
this
court
has
said
that
you
can't,
you
can't
lower
the
decibel
level
of
one
speaker
so
that
another
speaker,
in
this
case
the
generics,
can
be
heard
better?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
in
most
of
our
commercial
speech
cases
there
has
been
a
commodity.
here
it's
a
record
maintained
by
the
pharmacist.
we
think
of
a
pharmacist
as
selling
the
brand
name
or
generic
name,
but
whose
list
is
this?
whose
record
is
it?
is
it
the
pharmacist's
record
the
way
goods,
stock
in
trade,
would
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
asked
whether
there
are
sales
to
any
other
entities.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
stop
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
that
this
statute
doesn't
give
the
patient
any
control.
but
the
patient
is
already
taken
care
of
by
the
federal
law.
you
can't
--
i
mean,
the
patient
is
protected.
the
question
is
whether
the
physician
should
be
as
well.
