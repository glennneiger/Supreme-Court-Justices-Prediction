justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
could
use
it
for
other
purposes,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
the
chief
justice
suggested
is
right,
that
the
purpose
is
to
stop
them
from
using
it
in
order
to
market
their
drugs?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
right,
but
that
--
that
is
an
impediment
to
their
using
it
for
the
marketing
of
drugs.
you're
--
you're
placing
that
impediment
on
it.
isn't
that
the
obvious
purpose
of
it?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
necessarily
make
it
bad,
but
--
but
let's
not
quibble
over
what
the
purpose
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
purpose.
that's
the
purpose
of
it,
to
prevent
them
from
using
this
information
to
market
their
drugs.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
only
for
that
use
that
you
interpose
the
requirement
that
the
doctor
consent.
for
all
other
uses
you
don't
require
the
doctor's
consent,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
the
data
is
not
private
in
the
sense
that
the
physician
who
prescribes
knows
that
nobody
will
know
what
he
is
prescribing
and
how
much
he
prescribes
and
how
often,
because
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
do
know
that,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
thing
it
assures
the
physician,
the
physician
who
prescribes,
is
that
he
won't
be
bothered
by
drug
companies
who,
on
the
basis
of
their
knowledge
of
information
which
other
people
have,
approach
him
in
order
to
market
their
drugs?
that's
basically
all
it
assures
the
prescribing
physician,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
and
he
could
achieve
the
same
objective,
could
he
not,
by
simply
refusing
to
talk
to
the
marketer.
when
the
marketer
says,
you
know,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
a
new
drug,
he
says:
i
don't
talk
to
drug
manufacturers
and
marketers.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
it
increase
the
prescribing
physician's
right
of
privacy
that
the
data
about
his
prescribing
can
only
be
given
away
but
can't
be
sold?
does
that
make
him
feel
happier
about
his
privacy?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can
do
that
by
saying:
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be,
but
then
just
don't
tell
me
that
the
purpose
is
to
protect
their
privacy.
now
you're
arguing
a
totally
different
purpose:
it
makes
it
easier
for
the
physician
to
cut
off
approaches
by
drug
companies
that
want
to
sell
drugs.
if
that's
the
purpose
of
this
statute,
it's
quite
different
from
protecting
his
privacy.
his
privacy
isn't
protected
by
saying
you
can't
sell
it
but
you
can
give
it
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
information
necessary
for
effective
speech
is
what
you're
saying,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
only
restricts
the
information
necessary
for
really
effective
speech?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
looking
for
it
because
it
--
it
identifies
those
doctors
that
they
would
like
to
approach
with
their
information
which
may
say,
you
know,
our
product
is
much
better
than
the
generic;
our
quality
control
is
--
you
know,
whatever.
there
are
arguments
on
both
sides
of
those
things.
and
you
are
making
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
speak
by
restricting
access
to
information
that
would
enable
their
speech
to
be
most
effective.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
an
important
position.
if
you
--
if
that
indeed
was
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
you
should
have
told
the
court
of
appeals,
don't
you
think?
is
it
enough
to
say
we
didn't
say
no?
you
should
have
said
yes.
you
should
have
said
this
is
what
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
protect
his
privacy.
i
mean,
the
--
his
name
and
--
and
the
extent
of
his
prescriptions
can
be
given
away
for
a
lot
of
uses.
it
doesn't
protect
his
privacy.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
protect
--
it
enables
him
to
protect
himself
against
drug
companies
that
want
to
talk
to
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
so
long
as
i
know
that's
what
you're
talking
about.
when
you
say
"privacy",
you
don't
mean
the
prescriber's
concern
that
people
will
know
that
he
prescribed
certain
drugs.
he
doesn't
care
about
that,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
protected
by
this
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
protected
by
this
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
what
this
law
protects.
it
does
not
protect
his
privacy
in
that
sense.
it
protects
his
privacy
in
the
sense
that
it
enables
him
to
avoid
having
to
say
go
away
when
a
salesman
for
the
--
for
the
--
for
the
drug
company
comes,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
it
doesn't
even
protect
his
privacy
in
the
sense
that
it
enables
him
not
to
have
to
say
go
away.
it
doesn't
even
protect
that.
they
--
he
--
he
will
still
have
to
say
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the
drug
company
approaches
him
without
having
this
information.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
state
enact
a
law
that,
say,
petition
signers
cannot
approach
somebody
unless
he
has
given
his
prior
consent?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
doctors
can
do
that
if
they
don't
want
to
talk
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
take
"biased"
to
mean
false.
"biased"
means
one-sided.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
state
the
true
facts
only
on
one
side
and
not
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
has
not
been
argued
as
a
case
restricting
false
advertising,
has
it?
