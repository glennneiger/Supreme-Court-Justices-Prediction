one
of
the
respondents
argues
that
the
statute
would
permit,
does
permit,
the
use
of
this
information
for
what
they
call
a
counter-detailing
effort.
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
wasn't
really
my
question.
my
question
was
does
the
statute
permit
it.
if
vermont
wanted
to
do
that,
the
university
of
vermont
or
some
other
entity
wanted
to
do
that,
would
the
statute
permit
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
did
you
make
that
argument
below?
is
that
a
change
in
your
position?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
22a
of
the
petition,
summarizing
what
it
understood
you
to
be
arguing,
says:
"the
statute
only
imposes
restrictions
on
the
sale
or
use
of
such
data
for
marketing
or
promoting
a
prescription
drug.
"
that
was
an
inaccurate
characterization
of
your
--
the
second
circuit
did
not
understand
your
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
please
--
could
you
please
answer
yes
or
no?
if
you're
changing
your
position,
you're
changing
your
position.
it
seems
to
me
this
is
an
important
point,
and
if
the
second
circuit
based
its
decision
on
a
misunderstanding
of
vermont's
interpretation
of
its
own
statute,
i
would
think
you
would
at
least
bring
that
out
in
the
petition
for
rehearing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
did
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
the
doctor
who
didn't
want
the
information
distributed
to
anybody,
academic
researchers,
anybody?
does
the
law
give
that
--
give
the
doctor
that
option?
