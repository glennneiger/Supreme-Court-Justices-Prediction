justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
suppose
--
suppose
that
the
federal
trade
commission
after
a
3-year
study
of
pharmaceutical
manufacturing
practices,
decides
--
finds
the
following.
they
say:
we
have
found
that
when
drugs
are
sold
to
doctors
it
is
very
important
that
the
doctor
find
out
what's
curable,
what
the
drug
does,
how
much
it
costs;
and
by
the
way,
all
those
things
apply
no
matter
who
the
doctor
is.
who
the
doctor
is,
is
irrelevant.
and
therefore
marketing
that
focuses
upon
who
the
doctor
is
and
what
his
previous
practices
were
is
irrelevant
and
harmful
and
false;
and
therefore
we
find
that
it
is
a
false
and
deceptive
practice
under
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
to
use
the
following
prior
practices
of
the
doctor
in
selling
him
new
drugs,
because
it's
irrelevant
and
because
it's
false
and
because
it's
harmful.
and
they
enact
that
as
a
--
as
a
rule
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
does
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
forbid
them,
having
made
those
findings
in
detail,
from
controlling
advertising
to
prevent
what
they
have
determined
is
a
false
and
misleading
practice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
nobody
says
it
doesn't
apply.
the
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
not
interested
in
what
they're
saying
for
the
present
purposes.
i'm
interested,
surprisingly
enough,
in
what
i'm
saying.
[laughter]
so
therefore
i
would
like
to
know
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
a
highly
regulated
industry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
federal
trade
commission's
specialists
and
experts
in
false
and
deceptive
advertising
concludes
that
this
is
a
false
and
deceptive
practice,
are
you
going
to
say
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
forbids
them
from
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
--
well,
when
you
say
you
are,
is
there
any
precedent
that
says
they
can't
regulate
false
and
misleading
practice?
of
course
you
see
where
i'm
going.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
can,
why
can't
vermont?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
said
it
was
biased--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
they
--
they
have
made
a
study
of
it
in
the
legislature
and
that's
their
conclusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
where
i
was
going.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
chose
an
example
that's
beyond
your
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
why
i
wondered
how
you
would
respond
to
that.
so
--
i
thought
that
was
one
that
was
going
to
be
obviously
constitutional,
but
you're
going
to
stop
me
there.
so
--
so
what
i
want
to
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
how
is
this
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
suppose
i
don't
know
the
extent
to
which
this
does
or
does
not
promote
unbiased
information
from
going
to
the
doctors,
and
isn't
that
a
matter
for
the
doctors
themselves
and
the
vermont
legislature
rather
than
this
court
to
decide?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
the
federal
power
--
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
say,
we
want
you
to
collect
certain
information
about
who
is
using
what
natural
gas
and
give
it
to
the
fire
department?
it's
for
the
fire
department
in
case
of
emergency,
and
what
we
don't
want
to
have
happen
is
it's
used
to
stove
manufacturers
to
sell
homeowners
gas
stoves.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
could
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
fine.
if
they
could
do
that,
why
can't
they
do
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
this
is
information
--
see,
this
is
information
that
starts
off
being
collected
because
the
government
requires
it
to
be
collected.
so
it's
there
for
that
reason.
and
the
government
says
we
want
you
to
get
this
information,
it's
done
for
this
purpose,
so,
you
know,
other
purposes,
and
we
don't
want
it
to
be
used
for
commercial
advertising
purposes.
that's
what
they
say
they've
done
in
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
used
to
be
true
there
was
something
called
a
regulated
industry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
selling
was
simply
one
activity
among
many.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
were
lots
of
regulations
that
could
be
imposed
upon
selling.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
saying
that
all
those
should
be
reexamined?
