could
that
data
be
sold
to
a
university
for
research
purposes?
the
university
says:
we
really
want
this
information
to
do
some
research.
could
the
data
be
sold
to
the
university
for
that
purpose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
researcher
then
have
a
profile,
a
data
bank,
that
is
very
helpful
to
the
general
public,
and
sell
that
to
the
general
public,
to
the
newspapers
and
so
forth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
it's
sold
to
the
researcher.
the
researcher
then
comes
up
with
a
design
or
database
that
is
very
fascinating
for
a
number
of
reasons.
can
that
researcher
sell
it
to
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
am
not
--
i
still
am
not
sure.
in
my
hypothetical,
what
would
happen?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
pharmacy
sells
to
the
researcher.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
researcher
is
at
the
university.
the
researcher
has
a
data
bank
or
has
some
results
that
are
very
fascinating.
the
researcher
then
wants
to
sell
that
to
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine.
what
result
under
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
maybe
you're
being
--
you
were
the
one
that
made
the
argument
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
reducing
health
care
costs.
i
assume
that
is
by
selling
generics.
and
the
chief
justice
asked
you
a
question:
in
effect,
aren't
you
doing
this
by
regulating
speech?
and
you
say
no,
you
disagree.
i
don't
understand
that
answer
that
you
gave
to
the
chief
justice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
this
inconsistent
with
what
you
told
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
--
you're
representing
to
us
that
you
told
the
court
of
appeals
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
as
the
sg
is
interpreting
it
here;
that's
your
representation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
because
the
pharmaceutical
company
deems
this
to
be
the
most
efficient.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
state
can
prohibit
the
most
efficient
sort
of
speech,
whereas
if
it
just
had
general
dissemination
which
didn't
serve
any
particular
purpose,
that
would
be
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
if
it
becomes
--
becomes
focused
and
important
and
effective,
then
the
state
can
prohibit
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
your
page
again?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you
had
a
statute
in
which
the
pharmacy
cannot
give
the
information
or
sell
the
information
to
anybody;
it
must
remain
with
the
pharmacy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
copy
of
the
prescription
must
be
given
to
the
state
of
vermont.
the
state
of
vermont
then
has
the
same
restrictions
that
this
statute
has.
that
would
be
lapd.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
--
and
i
want
to
know
what
your
answer
would
be.
if
lapd
is
correct--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--then
what
ruling
would
we
have
to
make
in
my
hypothetical
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
exactly
not
this
case
but
just
in
the
abstract,
do
we
have
a
rule
that
if
there
are
two
statutes,
a,
the
statute
is
passed
for
a
bad
purpose,
b,
the
statute
is
not
passed
for
a
bad
purpose,
if
the
statute
is
otherwise
the
same,
are
they
both
unconstitutional
or
just
one
and
why?
and
what
case
do
i
look
to
other
than
maybe
church
of
lukumi?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
second
case
is
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
sorrel
versus
ims
health.
companies
that
manufacture
brand-name
prescription
drugs,
higher
marketers
to
promote
their
products.
some
of
these
marketers
visit
doctor's
offices
to
discuss
the
details
and
benefits
of
various
pharmaceuticals.
so
these
direct
marketers
are
called
“detailers”.
sales
persons
are
often
more
effective
when
they
are
familiar
with
the
preferences
of
their
customers.
pharmaceutical
sales
persons,
including
the
so-called
“detailers”
are
no
exemption.
they
use
information
regarding
doctors
past
prescription
decisions
to
concentrate
their
presentations
on
information
that
is
most
relevant
to
the
individual
doctor.
this
information
called
“prescriber-identifying
information”
is
collected
by
pharmacists.
pharmacists
sell
this
information
to
data
miners.
these
are
firms
that
analyze
the
data
and
produce
reports
on
individual
prescription
decisions.
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
and
the
detailers
then
purchase
the
information
from
the
data
miners.
in
2007,
vermont
enacted
a
law
that
place
limits
on
the
disclosure
and
use
of
prescriber-identifying
information.
the
measure
prohibits
pharmacists
from
selling
the
information
and
from
disclosing
it
for
marketing
purposes.
the
law
also
forbids
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
from
using
the
information
for
marketing.
some
vermont
data
miners,
and
in
association
of
pharmaceutical
manufacturers,
filed
suit
arguing
that
the
law
violated
their
first
amendment
rights.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
vermont
denied
relief,
but
the
second
circuit
reversed.
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
the
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
vermont's
law
raises
serious
first
amendment
concerns.
it
imposes
burdens
based
on
the
content
of
speech.
under
vermont's
law,
pharmacists
may
disclose
prescriber-identifying
information
for
many
purposes
including,
for
example,
healthcare
research.
but
the
law
forbids
pharmacists
from
selling
or
disclosing
the
information
for
marketing.
the
law
also
imposes
a
restriction
based
on
the
identity
of
the
speaker
by
preventing
drug
manufacturers
from
using
the
information
for
marketing.
under
the
first
amendment,
vermont
must
justify
these
contents
and
speaker-based
burdens
on
expression.
we
conclude
the
state
cannot
do
so.
vermont
suggest
that
its
law
protects
the
confidentiality
of
doctor's
prescription
decisions,
but
the
law
allows
for
the
widespread
disclosure
and
user-prescriber-identifying
information
and
so
does
not
advance
any
interest
in
confidentiality.
vermont
also
suggests
that
this
law
will
prevent
detailers
from
selling
so
many
brand-name
drugs.
in
the
states'
view,
that
outcome
is
desirable
because
brand-name
drugs
are
expensive
and
pose
special
health
risks.
the
states'
argument,
however,
is
contrary
to
basic
first
amendment
principles.
the
government
may
not
strive
to
keep
its
citizens
in
the
dark
so
that
they
will
make
decisions
the
state
prefers.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
kagan
joined.
