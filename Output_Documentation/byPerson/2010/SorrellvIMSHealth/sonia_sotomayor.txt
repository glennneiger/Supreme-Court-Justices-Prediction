justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
that
--
assuming
there's
some
form
of
privacy
that
relates
to
not
being
harassed
because
there's
certainly
legislative
record
of
doctors
or
groups
of
doctors
testifying
to
feeling
harassed
by
detailers,
if
thompson
requires
a
less
restrictive
method,
why
does
this
have
to
be
an
opt-in
rather
than
an
opt-out?
because
isn't
an
opt-out
i
call
up
and
say
i,
don't
want
you
to
have
this
information?
so
isn't
an
opt-out
less
restrictive?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but,
given
the
restrictions
on
speech,
why
is
that
a
bad
thing?
meaning
you
don't
really
intend
to
tell
us
that
the
state
couldn't
and
wouldn't
--
just
like
we
got
all
of
that
advertising
relating
to
the
opt-out
on
telephone
solicitations,
virtually
every
american
knew
they
could
do
it
if
they
chose.
maybe
some
didn't,
but
a
vast
majority
did.
you
can't
really
say
vermont's
incapable
of
telling
doctors
in
a
mailing
or
in
some
public
professional
magazine,
if
you
want
to
opt
out,
here's
the
number?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
goldstein,
i
--
i
understand
your
argument
and
i
have
a
difficulty.
today
with
the
internet
and
with
computers,
there's
virtually
no
privacy
individuals
have.
any
transaction
you
do
could
be
spread
across
the
world
instantaneously,
and
for
the
longest
time
catalogs
would
sell
your
name
and
address
to
other
catalogers,
and
if
you
bought
one
product
from
one
company,
you
would
get
a
thousand
catalogs
from
50
million
others.
today
the
industry
is
policing
that,
in
part
to
get
the
state
not
to
intercede,
by
giving
you
an
opt-out
option.
and
so,
if
you're
a
consumer
who
doesn't
want
a
million
catalogs,
the
industry
is
giving
you
the
right
to
opt
out,
so
they
don't
sell
your
address.
if
there
is,
as
i
see,
some
interest
that
the
state
legitimately
has
in
protecting
that
part
of
the
public
who
says,
i
entered
into
this
transaction,
i
didn't
really
want
you
to
sell
my
name,
i
didn't
want
you
to
do
other
things
with
it,
all
i
did
was
this
transaction,
why
can't
the
state
say
--
there
is
a
difference
in
my
mind
between
an
opt-in
and
opt-out?
why
can't
the
state
say,
your
desire
to
enter
a
transaction
in
which
you're
doing
just
that
transaction
and
not
others
is
something
we
can
protect?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
read
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
pharmacies
were
not
permitting
either
patients
and/or
doctors
to
opt
out;
that
if
a
patient
came
in
and
said
i
don't
want
my
doctor's
information
sold,
or
a
doctor
has
called
the
pharmacy
and
said,
i
don't
want
you
to
sell
my
information,
the
pharmacies
are
not
respecting
those
limitations.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
don't
i
read
this
statute
as
simply
doing
what
the
consumer
statutes
are
doing,
which
is
giving
people
some
control
outside
of
the
limited
transaction
that
they're
engaged
in?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
you're
saying
i
think
to
justice
kennedy
is
answering
my
earlier
question
by
saying
the
state
cannot
constitutionally
stop
the
spread
of
information.
so
if
the
state
said
to
the
pharmacy,
all
you
can
do
is
fill
the
prescription,
that's
what
doctors
think
pharmacies
are
doing,
and
that's
all
you
can
do,
you're
saying
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
really
--
you
are
really
hinging
your
argument
on
the
discrimination
aspect--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
--
that
drug
companies
or
detailers
are
being
treated
differently
than
any
other
user
of
this
information?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
do
it--
