chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
--
this
morning
in
case
10-779,
william
sorrell,
attorney
general
of
vermont,
v.
ims
health
incorporated.
ms.
asay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
purpose
--
the
purpose
is
to
prevent
sales
representatives
from
contacting
particular
physicians,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
want
to
lower
--
you
want
to
lower
your
health
care
costs,
not
by
direct
regulation,
but
by
restricting
the
flow
of
information
to
the
doctors,
by,
to
use
a
pejorative
word,
but
by
censoring
what
they
can
hear
to
make
sure
they
don't
have
full
information,
so
they
will
do
what
you
want
them
to
do
when
it
comes
to
prescribing
drugs,
because
you
can't
take,
i
gather,
direct
action
and
tell
them,
you
must
prescribe
generics,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
restricting
their
--
you're
--
you're
making
it
far
more
burdensome
for
the
manufacturers
to
reach
their
intended
audience,
right?
it's
as
if
i
want
--
there's
a
demonstration
in
town,
all
right?
they
need
a
permit
to
hold
the
demonstration.
they
get
the
permit.
i
want
to
hold
a
counter-demonstration,
and
you're
saying
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
i
know
where
their
demonstration
is
going
to
be
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we'll
--
we'll
give
you
--
we
seem
to
have
questions.
we'll
give
you
additional
time
for
rebuttal,
so
you
don't
--
don't
worry
that
we're
cutting
into
that.
but
you're
making
a
judgment
about
how
their
--
whether
or
not
their
speech
will
be
as
effective
or
not.
don't
you
think
they're
the
ones
who
are
entitled
to
make
that
judgment?
it
doesn't
mean
that
you're
right
or
wrong.
it
just
means
that
we
would
not
rely
on
your
determination
that
it
is
--
their
speech
is
just
as
effective.
they're
the
ones
doing
the
speaking
and
they
think
it's
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
afford
you
5
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
he's
required
to
provide
it,
but
he
would
be
required
to
provide
it
quite
apart
from
the
government
regulation,
right?
i
mean,
the
pharmacy
needs
to
know
who
to
make
the
prescription
out
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
our
precedents
made
--
indicated
that
it's
problematic
for
the
state
to
make
a
determination
about
what
uses
information
can
be
--
to
what
uses
information
can
be
put,
particularly
when
it's
an
interested
party
as
it
is
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
told
me
that
--
i
thought
you
told
me
that
this
doesn't
protect
physician
privacy
to
the
extent
of
saying
this
information
can't
be
used
for
academic
purposes
even
if
you,
the
physician,
don't
want
it
to
be
used
for
those
purposes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
physician
doesn't
get
to
decide
for
what
uses
the
information--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
if
the
statute
--
i'm
sorry.
what
if
the
statute
said
this
information
can
be
used
for
any
number
of
purposes,
except
not
for
anybody
who
is
going
to
criticize
the
state
of
vermont?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
information
--
this
information
cannot
be
used
for
any
purposes
--
can
be
used
for
any
purposes
except
a
purpose
that
will
make
things
more
expensive
for
the
state
of
vermont?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
say--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--let's
say
i
don't
like
to
be
bothered
by
people
knocking
on
my
door
by
saying,
sign
this
petition.
can
i
--
to
protect
my
privacy
interests,
can
i
prevent
that
as
a
general
matter?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there
is
another
interest
here
besides
the
state's
concern
about
health
care
costs,
and
that
is
the
physician's
privacy
interests.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
sell
this
information
to
whomever
you
want,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
could
sell
to
it
a
journalist
who
wants
to
expose
physicians
in
a
particular
area
who
prescribe
a
lot
of
a
particular
medication.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
public
can
discern
well,
this
is
the
guy
who
is
treating
these
people;
we
don't
like
these
people,
so
we're
going
to
pickett
outside
his
clinic.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
nothing
prevents
you
from
doing
that,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
don't
you
think
that's
protecting
physicians'
privacy,
to
prevent
that
from
happening?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
have
no
objection
i
take
it,
if
there
were
not
the
academic
exception
and
if
the
state
didn't
--
didn't
push
its
own
contrary
program?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
would
--
if
you
were
truly
concerned
about
physician
privacy--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
didn't
want
people
to
know
that
this
physician
prescribed
this
drug
more
often
because
it
tells
you
a
lot
about
his
practice--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
he
may
not
want
known,
how
would
you
--
how
would
you
write
this
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
you
remind
me
what
justice
kennedy
said?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
who's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--this
--
this
is,
mr.
kneedler
explained
this
is
the
government's
information.
why
can't
--
you
wouldn't
have
to
have
it
if
it
weren't
prescription.
it
was
the
fact
that
it
has
to
be
prescribed
that
requires
this
information.
the
government
frequently
controls
the
use
to
which
information
can
be
put.
it
makes
me
file
a
tax
return,
and
it
doesn't
allow,
you
know,
dissemination
of
that.
it
restricts
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
presumably
it
could
say
that
if
an
accountant
prepares
my
tax
return,
that
accountant
can't
sell
it,
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
this
any
different?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
asay,
you
have
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
asay,
i
want
to
give
you
the
chance
to
respond
to
a
point
that
was
highlighted
by
your
friend,
which
is
the
fourth
legislative
finding,
which
does
seem
to
say
that
the
state
is
doing
this
because
it
doesn't
like
an
imbalance
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
have
--
were
there
--
were
there
findings
with
respect
to
the
statute
as
enacted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
take
it
there's
--
there's
--
it's
against
the
law
for
a
physician
to
say
i
want
you
to
fill
this
prescription
in
a
particular
place,
a
particular
pharmacy
because
i
know
that
pharmacy
doesn't
sell
the
information.
they
can't
do
that,
can
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
