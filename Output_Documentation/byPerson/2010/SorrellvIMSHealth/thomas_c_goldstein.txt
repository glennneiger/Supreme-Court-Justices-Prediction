mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
good
morning:
you
will
want
to
have
available
you
to
the
red
brief
of
ims
health,
incorporated,
which
in
its
appendix
reproduces
the
statutes
and
findings.
and
the
reason
we
have
to
look
at
the
statutes
and
findings
in
this
argument
is
because
the
case
can't
be
decided
as
a
matter
of
absolutes.
we
know
that
statutes
like
hipaa
do
protect
private
information
in
third
parties'
hands
and
they
are
constitutional.
on
the
other
hand,
we
also
know
that
a
governmental
restriction
on
the
use
of
information
could
be
used
to
distort
the
marketplace
of
ideas.
so
the
case
is
going
to
have
to
be
decided
somewhere
in
the
middle.
and
in
order
to
do
that,
we're
going
to
have
to
figure
out
where
in
the
middle
vermont
ended
up.
now,
in
doing
that
i
want
to
clarify
i
think
three
things
in
the
questioning
of
the
first
half
hour.
they
are
about
what
the
practice
are
--
practices
are
at
issue
here;
what
this
statute
does,
actually
what's
the
rule;
and
why
is
it
that
vermont
did
it.
so
as
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
are
there
other
sales,
the
state
gave
you
the
correct
answer
that
the
pharmacy
companies
don't
sell
to
researchers,
but
that's
somewhat
misleading.
they
sell
to
us,
and
we
sell
to
the
researchers,
we
sell
to
the
government,
the
intermediaries
like
ims
health.
that's
because
we're
the
aggregator.
so
it
is
not
correct
to
say
that
the
only
sale
is
for
pharmaceutical
marketing.
second,
on
the
important
question
of
what
this
statute--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
and
i
said
the
state
gave
you
the
accurate
answer.
but
the
implication
of
the
answer
i
think
was
not
quite
correct,
because
there
are
sales
for
purposes
other
than
for
marketing.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
would
not,
because
the
point
would
then
--
and
i'll
come
to
the
statute
in
a
minute,
because
all
the
exemptions
--
right?
so
there's
--
there's
a
debate
that
justice
alito
focused
on
about
what
does
the
statute
mean,
and
i
do
want
to
turn
to
that
in
a
second.
but
to
jump
ahead
to
your
question,
justice
kagan,
assume
that
it's
a
general
sale
prohibition.
then
there
are
all
the
exemptions
and
the
exemptions
take
all
of
these
other
uses
out
from
the
sale
prohibition:
for
academic
research,
to
go
to
the
government,
and
for
clinical
trials,
for
health
care
research.
those
are
all
exempted
from
the
general
sale
prohibition.
so
let's
do
turn,
if
you
don't
mind,
to
what
it
is
the
statute
actually
does.
it
is
an
important
point.
first,
i
am
going
to
come
to
our
brief,
but
i
just
want
to
read
something.
for
your
later
reference
i'm
going
to
have
been
reading
from
page
42
of
phrma's
brief,
and
this
is
what
--
what
the
state
told
the
second
circuit,
quote:
"data
vendors
may
continue
to
acquire,
edit,
and
sell
this
information
to
whomever
they
choose
so
long
as
that
person
does
not
use
the
information
for
detailing.
"
in
turn,
the
second
circuit--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sorry.
that's
going
to
be
from
the
phrma
brief,
the
other
red
brief
at
page
42,
at
the
top
of
the
page.
so,
to
whomever
they
choose,
so
long
as
that
person
does
not
use
the
information
for
detailing.
the
second
circuit
said:
okay,
you're
the
state;
here's
how
we
understand
the
statute.
the
statute
only
imposed
--
quoting
again,
this
is
from
22a,
it's
the
language
that
justice
alito
quoted
--
the
statute
only
imposes
"restrictions
on
the
sale
or
use
of
such
data
for
marketing
or
promoting
a
prescription
drug.
"
so
that's
what
they
understood
the
statute
to
do.
now,
then
the
question
becomes
why
did
they
do
it?
this
was
--
justice
scalia,
you
tried
really
hard
to
get
them
just
to
admit,
let's
just
acknowledge
what
the
point
is
here.
and
the
state
tries
to
deny
that
the
purpose
here
is
to
limit
the
information
getting
into
the
hands
of
the
doctor.
we
don't
have
to
rely
on
the
state's
lawyers.
the
state
legislature
was
very
helpful
here.
so
if
we
go
to
the
appendix
of
the
ims
brief
now,
page
1a,
okay.
right
at
the
top,
the
state
says
their
goal
is
--
this
is
finding
number
1
at
the
bottom
of
it
--
containing
health
care
costs.
then
in
finding
number
2
they
explain
why
they
did
it:
"there
is
a
strong
link
between
pharmaceutical
marketing
activities,
health
care
spending
and
the
health
of
vermonters.
"
then
finding
number
3:
"the
goals
of
marketing
programs
are
often
in
conflict
with
the
goals
of
the
state.
"
and
my
favorite,
obviously,
is
number
4:
"the
marketplace
for
ideas
on
medicine
safety,
the
state
determined,
was
operating
in
conflict
with
the
goals
of
the
state.
"
they
didn't
like
the
marketplace
of
ideas.
now,
it
is
true,
we
acknowledge,
that
another
thing
the
state
wanted
to
do
was
to
give
the
doctors
some
more
control.
it's
in
--
it's
in
--
there
is
an
opt-out
option.
but
can
i
just
take
you
to
how
the
state
explained
what
it
was
doing?
that's
just
going
to
be
on
page
7.
now,
the
state's
lawyer
and
the
solicitor
general
have
explained
to
you
that
they
believe
that
doctors
were
concerned
only
with
marketing
and
only
with
marketing
to
them.
that's
not
true.
finding
29.
we
have
to
go
all
the
way
to
number
29
to
get
to
this
goal
of
the
state:
7:
"health
care
professionals
in
vermont
who
write
prescriptions
for
their
patients
have
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
information
in
that
prescription,
including
their
own
identity
and
that
of
the
patient,
will
not
be
used
for
purposes
other
than
the
filling
and
processing
of
the
payment
for
that
prescription.
"
it's
not
just
about
pharmaceutical
marketing.
the
doctors
say
--
we
all
love
this;
there's
stuff
about
us
in
our
daily
lives
that
we
wish
was
entirely
private.
the
doctors
here
said:
hey,
it
would
be
great
for
us
if
this
information,
we
had
complete
control
over
it.
doctors
also
would
love
if
medical
malpractice
judgments
weren't
broadly
known.
there
are
all
kinds
of
government
records
they
would
prefer
not
to
be
out
into
the
public
sphere.
but
then
we
ask
ourselves,
all
right
--
and
that's
why
i
asked
you
to
have
this
brief
available
--
what
did
the
state
do?
did
the
state
in
fact
enact
a
general
privacy
provision?
is
it
like
hipaa
or
instead
is
all
that
the
state
did
here
target
the
use
for
marketing,
while
it
allows
the
use
of
the
same
data
for
the
opposite
message
by
insurers
and
also
by
the
government?
so
here's
the
statute.
it
appears
on
page
9
of
the
appendix.
i
want
to
start
with
subsection
a
because
the
state
helpfully
reiterates
its
goals
here.
the
second
half
of
this
paragraph:
"the
state
sought
to
ensure
costs
are
contained
in
the
private
health
care
sector,
as
well
as
for
state
purchasers
of
prescription
drugs,
through
the
promotion
of
less
costly
drugs
and
ensuring
prescribers
received
unbiased
information.
"
that's
what
they're
trying
to
do.
they're
trying
to
say:
we
would
like
the
drug
companies
to
have
a
harder
time
finding
the
doctors
while
the
insurance
companies
and
the
state
have
an
easy
time
finding
the
doctors.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
oh,
i
apologize.
we're
allowed
to
do
it
before
and
after
the
statute,
is
my
point.
remember,
what
the
statute
does
is
--
and
this
was
the
debate
that
justice
alito
tried
to
point
us
to
about
what
the
statute
actually
does
and
the
second
circuit,
what
it
understood
the
statute
to
mean.
and
i
should
also
say
the
cert
petition
didn't
say
that
there
was
a
problem
with
that.
vermont
picked
out
one
thing.
it
said:
look,
when
drug
companies
can
find
the
doctors
easily,
they
can
persuade
the
doctors
to
use
more
expensive
drugs.
we
pay
a
lot
for
drugs.
we
would
prefer
that
not
happen,
so
we're
going
to
make
it
harder.
and
the
state
will
have
its
counter-detailing
program,
it
will
have
its
drug
utilization
review
program,
and
insurers
will
advocate
for
less
expensive
drugs.
all
the
other
uses
are
still
permitted.
if
vermont
were
serious
about
protecting
the
doctors'
privacy,
as
opposed
to
kind
of
a,
a
right
of
publicity,
a
control
over
information
about
them,
it
wouldn't
have
all
these
exemptions;
it
would
have
a
provision
that
says
this
is
private
information.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
do
know
--
i
don't
know,
but
i
do
know
the
first
amendment
applies
to
the
rule.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
they
--
they
do.
i've
got
a
couple
people--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
am,
but
i'm
also
going
to
say
that
i
don't
have
to
win
that
argument
to
win
this
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
do.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
if
it's
actually
false
and
misleading.
you
can't
just--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
don't
think
that
the
government
can
say
that
because
speech
is
so
influential
it
is
false
and
biased.
but
i
will
say,
justice
breyer,
in
my
defense
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
that's
exactly
right.
and
what
we
like--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
it's
a
case
about
restricting
true
advertising.
justice
breyer,
can
i
just
make
one
point
really
quick?
and
that
is,
you
dissented
in
thompson
v.
western
states
and
your
dissent
in
that
case
says
these
are
drugs,
the
compounded
drugs
that
have
not
been
approved
by
the
fda,
and
i'm
very
concerned
that
you're
evading
the
fda
regulatory
requirements
about
truthful
advertising.
these
are
the
opposite
drugs.
these
are
the
drugs
that
all
the
messages
that
are
being
conveyed
here
have
been
preapproved
by
the
fda.
this
is
truthful
and
accurate
speech,
and
the
state
only
wants
one
side
of
the
debate
to
get
out.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
why
it's
called
a
hypothetical.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
a
couple
of
things
about
that.
first,
as
i
said,
these
are
messages
that
have
been
cleared
by
the
experts.
the
fda
has
to
review
all
the
detailing
communications.
second,
the
doctors
do
get
to
say:
i
don't
want
you
to
come
visit
me.
they
do
that
all
the
time.
my
dad's
a
doctor;
he
doesn't
visit
with
detailers.
this
is
instead
a
rule
about
whether
you
can
talk
about
--
about
someone,
not
talk
to
someone.
the
drug
companies
and
the
intermediaries
are
talking
about
drug
--
about
prescriber
practices,
and
you
can
decide
who
you
want
to
try
and
approach.
there's
nothing
alleged
to
be
false
or
misleading.
third,
the
way
the
first
amendment
works
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas
that
so
upsets
vermont
is
that
both
sides
get
to
tell
their
story,
right?
the
thing
that
is
supposed
to
be
biased
here
is
that
the
drug
companies
have
too
much
money.
that
is
not
a
basis
for
restricting
speech.
the
way
it
works
is
if
the
message
is
accurate,
as
the
fda
has
determined
it
to
be,
the
drug
companies
can
go
make
their
pitch.
vermont
can
come
along
and
make
the
opposite
pitch.
terrific.
so
can
insurance
companies.
but
what
you
can't
do
is
have
a
rule
that
says
one
side
is
going
to
have
a
much
harder
time
getting
to
their
audience.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
can.
and
let
me
explain
why
it
is
that
that
rule
--
and
let
me
typify
it
for
you.
there
is
a
pending
bill
in
the
congress
called
the
mccain-kerry
consumer
protection
act
and
it
does
what
you're
talking
about.
it
says
we're
not
just
going
to
leave
it
to
the
industry;
we're
going
to
have
a
set
of
governmental
rules.
let
me
distinguish
that
bill
from
what
goes
on
under
act
80.
what
that
says
is
that
if
you
are
a
consumer
and
you
engage
in
a
transaction,
you
have
the
right
to
opt
out
of
any
unauthorized
uses,
because
it's
just
between
you
and
the
business,
right?
so
there
are
three
differences
between
that
and
this.
the
first
is
the
structure
of
the
statute.
that's
not
what
this
statute
does.
this
statute
says
every
use
of
the
information
is
just
fine,
except
this
one,
this
one
that
allows
one
speaker
who
we
don't
really
like
to
go
out
and
convey
its
message.
the
second
difference
is
the
public
importance
of
the
speech
involved.
what
that
consumer
information
would
be
used
for
is
to
make
some
random
consumer
pitch
to
you
or
about
you.
this
is
information
about
lifesaving
medications
where
the
detailer
goes
in
and
talks
about
double
blind
scientific
studies
that
are
responsible
for
the
development
of
drugs
that
have
caused
40
percent
of
the
increase
in
the
lifespan
of
the
american
public.
so
there's
a
tremendous
difference
in
the
public
importance.
the
third
is
the
fundamentally
different
nature
of
the
privacy
interest.
unlike
your
consumer
transaction
over
the
internet,
this
is
a
doctor.
you
can
call
up
any
doctor's
office
and
find
out
what
their
prescribing
practice
is.
it's
part
of
their
business.
imagine
the
following
conversation,
if
you
will,
and
that
is,
and
--
and
if
you
want
to
look
for
a
place
in
the
common
law
where
this
comes
from,
it
would
be
section
652d
of
the
restatement,
second,
of
torts,
what
things
are
private
and
what
aren't.
it
asks
whether
a
reasonable
person
would
be
outraged.
if
one
doctor
were
to
say
to
another
one,
you
know
what,
dr.
smith
told
people
that
three
out
of
four
times
i
prescribe
aciphex
for
--
as
a
proton
pump
inhibitor,
would
anybody
be
outraged
about
that?
no.
but
if
you
knew
that
the
--
the
company
that
you
bought
from
on
the
internet
was
selling
that
information
or
if
they
were
giving
away
private
medical
information,
you
would
genuinely
be
outraged.
so,
justice
sotomayor,
the
reason
i
started
this
argument
about
it
has
to
end
up
in
the
middle
is
we
know
that
statutes
like
that
have
to
be
constitutional.
at
the
same
time,
we
know
that
the
government
can
use
controls
over
information
to
really
distort
speech.
so
the
question
is,
what
happens
in
this
statute?
and
this
statute
has
a
structure
that's
not
intended
to
protect
privacy.
it
would
look
totally
different.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sure.
a
couple
of
things.
remember,
the
patients
have
nothing
to
do
with
this.
the
state
doesn't
give
any
control
to
the
patient.
that
would
be
true
before
or
after.
so
we're
talking
about
the
doctors.
i
--
i
did
concede,
when
i
read
you
finding
29
at
page
7
of
the
appendix,
that
this
does
give
a
little
bit
more
control
to
the
doctor.
i
mean,
it
just
does.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
agree,
justice
ginsburg.
justice
sotomayor
in
her
question
to
me
said,
why
don't
i
read
this
as
giving
--
she
said
that
they
aren't
giving
patients
options
about
what
happens
with
this
prescription
information.
my
only
point
was
this
statute
doesn't
change
it.
you're
quite
right
that
our
--
our
position
is
no
threat
to
the
protection
of
private
health
information,
which
is
reasonably
regarded
as
extremely
confidential.
so,
on
the
question
of
whether
it
give
some
greater
control,
it
does.
but
what
--
the
thing
you
have
to
focus
on
here
is
the
line
that
it
draws
in
when
it
gives
greater
control
is
a
line
that's
intended
to
discriminate
against
a
speaker.
you
have
to
look,
take
--
i'll
give
you
an
example
of
this,
cincinnati
v.
discovery
network.
the
city
of
cincinnati
came
to
you
and
said,
look,
we've
eliminated
the
commercial
news
racks,
and
these
people
who
want
to
sell
their
commercial
stuff
should
use
something
other
than
news
racks.
we're
targeting
the
blight
that
comes
from
commercial
news
racks.
this
court
said:
look,
you
can't
redefine
your
interests
to
reflect
your
statute.
you
can't--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
that's
lapd
v.
united
reporting.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
because
the
key
point
in
lapd
v.
united
reporting
is
that
it's
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
let
me
--
the
fact--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
what
they
say.
they're
just
not
right.
the--
[laughter]
this
information
--
i
would
direct
you
to
the
amicus
brief
--
you
don't
have
to
pull
it
out
right
now,
but
for
later.
the
brief
of
the
national
association
of
chain
drugstores,
if
you
just
make
a
reference,
on
pages
10
to
11
collects
the
history
of
how
this
information
has
been
gathered.
and
they
make
the
point
that
the
court
did
in
the
first
30
minutes,
that
of
course
the
doctor
is
going
to
put
his
name
on
the
prescription.
we
have
to
be
able
to
call
the
doctor
and
say:
i
can't
read
your
handwriting.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
would
be
lapd.
if
the
--
it
would
be
almost
lapd.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
if
it's
in
the
hands
of
the
--
so
let
me
just
make
sure
i
am
on
the
same
page.
i
am
going
to
answer
your
question
directly.
the
pharmacy
can't
disclose
it
directly
to
anyone
else.
the
government
gets
a
copy
of
it.
that
does
not
make
it
lapd.
if
the
pharmacy
was
government-owned,
that
would
be
lapd.
now,
let
me
answer
your
hypothetical.
right?
lapd,
it
was
an
arrest
record,
it
was
in
the
hands
only
of
the
state.
the
court
said:
look,
this
is
the
state's
information.
justice
ginsburg's
concurrence
says:
it's
like
a
subsidy,
the
decision
whether
to
give
it
out
or
not.
now,
in
your
hypothetical,
which
is
it
is
in
a
private
hand,
but
it
is
banned
for
any
other
use
--
that
would
be
a
real
privacy
statute.
i
think
that
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional,
but
it
would
be
much
closer.
the
reason
it
might
be
unconstitutional
is
twofold.
first,
that
the
privacy
interest
in
it
i
think
is
not
very
significant,
because
it's
how
the
doctor
runs
his
or
her
business,
and
second
it
would
still
allow
the
discrimination.
if
you
were
convinced
in
your
hypothetical
that
what
vermont
was
trying
to
do
is
what
it
said
it
was
doing
here
in
its
findings,
and
that
is,
to
make
it
harder
for
the
drug
companies
to
reach
the
audience
and
make
it
easier
for
the
insurance
company
and
the
government
to
reach
their
audience,
greater
new
orleans
broadcasting,
which
involves
a
ban
on
private
casino
speech
but
not
tribal
and
governmental
speech,
says
discriminating
against
speakers
like
that
is
very
troubling.
so
that's
i
think
how
your
hypothetical--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
am
saying
that
that's
unconstitutional.
i
am
also
saying
that
the
reason
is
very
specific
to
this
kind
of
information,
that
is
that
it
would
allow
speaker
discrimination,
and
i
am
also
saying
most
emphatically
that
is
not
this
case.
that
would
be
a
much
closer
case.
it
would
look
much
more
like
a
real
privacy
statute.
what
i
would
take
from
the
hypothetical
is
not
the
lesson
we
should
lose
--
and
you
should
never
take
that
lesson--
[laughter]
--but
the
--
but
instead
the
lesson
that
that's
what's
so
different
about
this
statute.
this
statute,
as
in
all
the
language
quoted
earlier,
says
katie
bar
the
door,
do
whatever
you
want
to
do
with
this
stuff,
just
don't
do
something
we
disagree
with
when
it
comes
to
the
message.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
am--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
a
principal
part
of
our
argument.
i
did
say
before
in
describing
the
kerry-mccain
bill,
that
there
were
three
things,
not
just
the
discrimination,
but
the
greater
public
interest
of
the
--
the
detailer
speech
and
the
lower
privacy
interest,
so
i
wouldn't
throw
those
out.
now
can
i
just
preempt
an
argument
that
my
friend
from
the
vermont
--
state
of
vermont
is
going
to
say
in
her
rebuttal?
and
that,
is
she's
going
to
come
and
say
that,
look,
the
insurance
companies
are
actually
paying
for
the
drugs.
all
their
--
this
exception
is
not
one
that's
about
advocacy,
and
i
just
want
to
make
sure
we
all
know
ahead
of
time
because
i
don't
get
a
surrebuttal,
that
that's
not
accurate.
so
if
--
if
you
still
have
the
ims
brief
with
you
at
page
53
this
time,
so
at
page
53
the
first
paragraph
is
about
the
state's
own
use
of
this
information
for
a
variety
of
purposes.
there
is
--
the
reply
brief
for
the
state
introduces
a
debate
about
today
whether
they
are
using
the
npi
data
for
counter-detailing.
there
is
no
dispute
that
they
use
it
for
other
state
programs,
like
the
drug
utilization
program
--
that's
the
quotes
in
the
first
paragraph.
but
the
better
paragraph
is
going
to
be
--
it's
the
second
paragraph,
it
starts,
the
state
--
"the
statute's
parallel
formulary
compliance
exemption.
"
and
this
paragraph
talks
about
advocacy
by
the
insurance
companies.
so
it's
not
just
that
the
drug
--
insurance
company
says
to
the
doctor,
i'll
pay
for
--
$5
for
this
drug,
but
the
insurance
companies
take
pi
data
under
the
exemption
in
the
statute,
go
to
doctors
and
say
we
really
think
this
cheaper
drug
would
be
better.
that
is
straight-out
speaker
discrimination.
so
we
quote
kolassa:
"insurance
companies
are
using
physician-identifiable
information
to
call
physicians
to
try
to
get
them
to
comply
with
formularies,
to
try
to
get
them
to
change
their
prescribing
in
a
way
that
may
or
may
not
be
in
the
patient's
best
interests.
"
"in
just.
"
--this
is
a
further
quote
--
"in
just
the
last
couple
of
years
there
has
been
an
amazing
increase
in
the
amount
of
information
provided
by
payers,
insurers
that
will
send
scientific
documents
to
physicians.
"
--i've
rolled
over
to
page
53
--
"will
call
when
physicians
are
prescribing
too
much
or
too
little
of
a
product
and
provide
them
with
information.
"
it
goes
on
and
on
--
"virtually
several
times
a
day".
so
that
is
the
message
that
i
would
take
away
from
the
argument,
and
that
is
we
are
emphatically
in
favor
of
the
constitutionality
of
hipaa,
of
the
mccain-kerry
bill,
the
things
that
concerned
you.
you
have
to
decide
this
case
in
the
middle
about
what
vermont
actually
did,
and
it
was
unbelievably
candid
about
what
it
was
trying
to
do.
it
said
the
marketplace
of
ideas
doesn't
work
for
us,
and
so
it
designed
a
statute
--
and
you
can
decide
this
case
very
narrowly
on
the
ground
that
what
vermont
did
is
it
went
too
far
is
in
just
saying
we're
not
actually
trying
to
protect
privacy;
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
give
the
doctors
control
when
it
suits
our
own
best
interests.
i
do
want
to
preempt
one
other
last
argument,
and
that
is
the
suggestion
that
this
isn't
paternalistic
at
all.
right?
we
just
let
the
doctors
decide.
but
the
state's
goal,
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do,
is
paternalistic.
the
reason
the
state
picked
this
one
exemption,
the
reason
it
picked
between
these
speakers,
is
because
it
doesn't
want
this
message
to
get
to
the
doctors.
and
if
you
can
keep--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure,
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
--
i
thankfully
am
not.
here
are
the
--
here
are
the
cases.
this
was
the
argument
that
was
made
and
rejected
in
virginia
board
of
pharmacy
which
was
about
a
pharmacy
rule.
they
said
that
it
would
be
unprofessional.
then
the
solicitor
general
in
the
person
of
mr.
kneedler
came
you
to
in
thompson
v.
western
states
and
said
we
need
to
stop
this
compounded
drug
marketing
because
this
is
heavily
regulated;
this
is
a
closed
market,
and
the
court
said,
i'm
sorry,
no.
the
nature
of
a
marketplace
of
ideas
is
you
get
to
say
your
piece
and
the
other
side
gets
to
say
their
piece.
the
fda
heavily
regulates
this
area,
the
information
is
perfectly
accurate
and
it's
incredibly
valuable.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
would
have
much
less
of
an
objection,
and
that's
no
accident.
let
me
just
say
this
is
not
a
flaw
in
the
drafting.
the
state
really
wanted
to
push
its
counter
message,
and
thankfully
so.
this
government
has
a
real
interest
here.
insurers
have
a
real
interest
here,
but
so
does
the
other
side
of
the
debate,
and
what
the
state
doesn't
get
to
do
is
just
pick
sides
and
prevent
the
debate
from
happening.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
you
would
take
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
confront
whether
such
a
statute
would
be
constitutional
because
it
would
be
very
different.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
he
said
the
rule
is
the
pharmacy
can't
give
it
to
anybody.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
why
that
protects
privacy.
that
protects
against
commercialization,
but
i
don't
think
the
government
has
nearly
as
much
interest
in
commercialization
as
it
does
in
actual
privacy.
section
652d
of
the
restatement
of
torts
doesn't
talk
about
the
outrage
of
being
able
to
use
--
we
have
a
capitalist
economy,
and
we
sell
newspapers
and
books
and
those
sorts
of
thing.
commercialization
isn't
a
bad
thing.
it's
a
question
of
whether
privacy
is
genuinely
protected.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
you
look
to
--
yes,
we
win
--
thompson
v.
western
states.
remember
what
the
government's
argument
there
was:
if
you
allow
the
marketing
of
compounded
drugs
that
are
not
fda
approved
you
will
evade
the
very
important
fda
regulatory
program.
that
was
a
perfectly
important
rationale,
and
the
court
said
but
it
also
has
the
purpose
of
keeping
information
out
of
the
hands
of
doctors.
it's
unconstitutional.
i'll
give
you
another
example.
grosjean,
minneapolis
star
and
--
raglan
--
those
are
cases
about
taxing
the
instruments
of
communication.
so
a
tax
on
newsprint,
a
tax
on
ink;
and
the
court
said
we're
not
worried
about
your
bad
motive,
you
have
a
very
important
rationale
in
trying
to
raise
revenue,
that's
a
perfectly
valid
purpose;
but
what
you're
also
doing
is
you're
picking
out
the
press
and
you're
making
it
harder
to
speak;
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
oh,
okay.
two
pieces
to
the
puzzle.
the
first
is
why
can't
i
demand
it
from
the
irs?
okay?
and
second
is
going
to
be
why
can't
the
accountant
give
it
away?
the
first
one
is
lapd,
and
it's
the
same
true
--
the
same
thing
is
true
of
campaign
finance
reports.
the
government
has
plenary
authority;
when
you
give
information
to
the
government,
what
the
government
then
does
with
the
information.
the
important
lesson
to
be
derived
from
lapd
is
that
nine
members
of
the
court
seemingly
agreed
--
and
i
defended
the
statute
in
that
case
--
nine
members
of
the
court
in
that
case
agreed
that
if
this
had
been
private
reports
rather
than
the
government's
reports,
then
the
statute
would
have
been
unconstitutional.
the
reason
your
tax
preparer
can't
give
it
away,
the
reason
i
can't
give
away
attorney-client
secrets,
the
reason
that
the
government
is
going
to
be
able
to
tell
internet
companies
that
they
can't
give
await
the
consumer
information
is
that
it's
really
private.
but
what
if,
instead,
the
government
had
a
rule
that
says
tax
preparers
can't
give
out
tax
information
when
it
will
encourage
people
to
protest
against
their
taxes?
but
if
it
will
encourage
people
to
comply
with
their
taxes,
it's
perfectly
fine.
you
can't
draw
lines
that
are
intended
to
discriminate
against
speakers.
that's
the
main
principle
of
our
case.
thank
you
very
much.
