mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago,
congress
declared
federal
employer
sanctions
central,
not
peripheral,
to
the
policy
of
immigration
law.
congress
broadly
swept
away
state
and
local
laws,
preempting
any
sanction
upon
those
who
employ
unauthorized
aliens,
with
the
sole
exception
being
a
mere
parenthetical
for
licensing
and
similar
laws.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
first
let
me
tell
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
we
think
a
licensing
law
is
and
then
deal
with
the
"similar"
question.
we
think
a
licensing
law,
as
congress
defined
it
in
irca,
was
the
traditional
licensing
laws
that
were
in
place
in
1986.
those
were
largely
farm
labor
contractor
laws.
they
were
aimed
at
fitness
to
do
business,
and
they
had
a
few
essential
characteristics
in
those
laws.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
oh,
absolutely.
but
i
think
that
this
licensing
law
looks
very
different
from
the
ones
you
are
referring
to
or
the
farm
labor
contractor
ones
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
first
is
licensing
laws
issue
licenses.
they
are
generally
about
the
issuance
of
licenses,
not
simply
ones
in
which
licenses
are
revoked.
second,
they
are
ones
in
which
the
issuance
of
the
license,
the
criteria
for
issuance
is
the
same
as
the
criteria
for
revocation.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
no.
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--in
general
itself
that
is
not
a
licensing
law.
licensing
laws
share
a
number
of
characteristics.
now,
we
can
debate
about
whether
subtracting
one
or
another
of
those
characteristics--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--because,
justice
scalia,
congress
wanted
to
preserve
the
states
traditional
power
for
licensing
laws,
which
were
about
fitness
to
do
business.
and
what
arizona
has
done--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--no.
i
think
that
the
criteria
would
be
the
same
for
issuance
and
revocation.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
because,
justice
scalia,
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
preserve
the
state's
and
localities
traditional
power
for
fitness
to
do
business.
and
one
good
indicia
that
fitness
to
do
business
is
not
was
what
at
issue
in
the
particular
law
is
that
they
will
let
businesses
operate,
they
will
license
them
without
any
care
whatsoever
as
to
whether
they
have
a
history
of
violating
the
particular
provisions.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
scalia,
that
would
solve
that
problem.
now
there
are
other
hallmarks
of
licensing
law.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
correct.
that
itself,
i
don't
think,
is
relevant
to
whether
the
licensing
law
--
the
other
hallmarks
are
that
they
have
discretionary
adjudication
by
an
expert
body,
that
it's
not
mandatory,
that
it
is
generally
aimed
at
qualifications
to
do
business.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
a
state
could
certainly
make
that
part
of
its
genuine
fitness
to
do
business
law.
now,
here
arizona
hasn't
done
that.
and
we
know
that
because
the
criteria
for
issuance
of
the
license
are
entirely
divorced
from
the
criteria
for
revocation
of
the
license.
and
if
arizona
really
believed,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
you
are
saying,
which
is
that
it's
relevant
to
the
--
the
violation
is
relevant
to
whether
they
can
do
business
or
not,
they
allow
every
single
one
of
these
entities
to
get
the
license.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
sotomayor,
i'm
not
talking
about
purpose.
i'm
saying
look
at
the
face
of
the
statute
and
see
what
is--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--right.
so
that
looks
like
a
punishment
statute.
there
are
essentially
two
boxes
here--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--right.
and
this
is
not
a
licensing
law.
congress
essentially
had
two
boxes
in
1986.
one
was
the
traditional
fitness
to
do
business
laws
and
the
other
was
what
congress--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
the
federal
adjudication
is
expressly
--
state
adjudication
of
a
federal
violation
is
expressly
preempted
as
well
as
impliedly
so
for
three
reasons.
the
first
is
that
congress
in
developing
irca
in
the
comprehensive
scheme
set
out
a
series
of
procedures,
federal
adjudication
with
an
alj,
all
sorts
of
different
regulations
to
the
jot
and
tittle.
and
what
arizona
does
here
is
what
40,000
different
localities
can
do
if
this
law
is
upheld,
which
is
have--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--it's
undoubtedly
the
case
that
without
the
parenthetical,
the
mere
parenthetical
savings
clause,
that
arizona-like
laws
would
be
swept
away
as
sanctions
--
that
these
are
sanctions
imposed.
so
the
question
is
whether
the
licensing
law
phrase
saves
that.
and
i
think
it
saves
the
state
adjudication
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
because
to
read
the
statute
that
way
is
to
permit
all
of
those
states
to
have
their
own
laws,
and
it's
undoubtedly
the
case
that
congress
wanted
to
sweep
away
the
decanas-style
state
statutes
that
were
in
place
that
imposed
sanctions
on
employers.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
think
that
the
answer
depends
on
what
congress
is
trying
to
get
at.
in
1986
we
know
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
with
respect
to
state
enforcement
of
immigration
laws.
they
broadly
swept
away
the
decanas-style
laws
and
they
said
for
the
i-9
provisions,
which
president
reagan
described
as
the
keystone
of
the
act,
that
i-9
documents
can't
be
used
in
any
procedure
besides
irca
procedures.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
if
it
has
independent
adjudication
it
is
swept
away
by
the
first
parts
of
the
h2
statute
which
say,
which
say
the
provisions
of
this
section
preempt
any
state
or
local
law
imposing
civil
or
criminal
sanctions.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
because
if
i
understand
--
i
may
not
understand
the
hypothetical,
but
the
word
provisions
refers
to
the
entire
subset,
the
entire
statute
in
irca
including
the
procedural
protections,
the
procedures
that
follow
for
federal
enforcement
of
immigration
laws.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
and
our
position
is
that
this
is
not
a
licensing
law
because
it
doesn't
bear
any
of
the
indicia
of
a
traditional
licensing
law.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
no,
i
don't
think
so.
congress
when
they
used
similar
meant
to
side
step
the
schematic
debate
about
whether
something
is
a
certificate
as
some
of
the
farm
labor
contractor
statutes
use
that
term
or
a
license.
