justice
john
a.
campbell
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
(irca),
makes
it
unlawful
to
knowingly
employ
and
unauthorized
alien.
employers
that
violate
the
prohibition
may
be
subjected
to
federal
civil
and
criminal
sanctions.
irca
also
restricts
the
ability
of
states
to
combat
employment
of
unauthorized
workers.
the
act
provides
that
states
cannot
impose
civil
or
criminal
sanctions
on
such
employers
"other
that
through
licensing
and
similar
laws.”
that's
important
language,
“other
than
through
licensing
and
similar
laws.”
well,
arizona
passed
a
licensing
law
known
as
the
legal
arizona
workers
act.
that
law
provides
that
the
licenses
of
state
employers
that
knowingly
or
intentionally
employ
unauthorized
aliens
may
be
suspended
or
revoked
and
in
certain
circumstances
must
be
suspended
or
revoked.
the
chamber
of
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
various
business
and
civil
rights
organization,
which
i
will
refer
to
collectively
as
the
chamber,
filed
suit
to
block
the
law,
arguing
that
it
was
preempted
by
federal
law
or
irca.
the
federal
district
court
in
arizona
upheld
the
law
and
so
did
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
now,
as
just
to
explain,
the
federal
law
expressly
preserves,
not
preempt
state
authority
to
impose
sanctions
through
licensing
and
similar
laws.
that
is
what
the
arizona
law
does.
it
instructs
courts
to
suspend
or
revoke
the
business
licenses
of
in-state
employers
that
employ
unauthorized
aliens.
now,
the
chamber
argues
that
when
congress
said
licensing,
what
it
really
meant
was
a
specific
type
of
license
such
as
a
license
to
operate
a
farm
labor
contracting
business.
but
no
such
limit
is
even
remotely
discernible
in
the
statutory
text.
we
think
it
pretty
unlikely
that
congress
would
say
license
if
what
it
meant
was
a
license
to
operate
a
farm
labor
contracting
business.
the
chamber
also
argues
that
when
congress
said
that
states
could
impose
sanctions
through
licensing
laws,
what
it
really
meant
was
that
states
could
only
do
so
after
a
prior
federal
adjudication
that
an
employer
had
hired
an
unauthorized
alien.
but
again,
such
a
limitation
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
federal
statute
and
it
is
not
our
job
to
rewrite
the
law
to
put
one
in.
the
chamber
contends
that
even
if
the
arizona
licensing
law
is
not
expressly
preempted,
it
is
impliedly
preempted.
we
will
find
implied
preemption
when
you
put
the
federal
law
and
the
state
law
side-by-side
and
the
two
really
can't
work
together.
in
that
event,
the
state
law
has
to
yield,
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
arizona
statute
simply
implements
the
sanctions
that
congress
expressly
allowed
the
states
to
pursue
through
licensing
laws.
and
here,
arizona
has
gone
the
extra
mile
by
closely
tracking
the
federal
laws
provisions
immaterial
respects.
the
state
law
adopts
the
federal
definition
of
who
qualifies
as
an
unauthorized
alien.
the
state
law
provides
that
state
investigators
must
verify
the
work
authorization
of
an
allegedly
unauthorized
alien
with
the
federal
government.
the
state
law
requires
a
state
court
to
consider
--
this
is
a
quote,
“to
consider
only
the
federal
government's
determination
of
employee
status.”
the
chambers
asserts
that
employers
will
air
on
the
side
of
discrimination
rather
than
risk
having
their
business
licenses
revoked
by
hiring
unauthorized
workers,
but
that
is
not
the
choice.
an
arizona
business
has
to
do
a
lot
more
than
simply
hire
an
unauthorized
alien
to
have
its
licenses
suspended
or
revoked.
the
hiring
has
to
be
knowing
or
intentional
and
license
termination
is
an
available
sanction
only
for
a
second
knowing
or
intentional
violation
during
a
probationary
period
imposed
for
the
first
violation
at
the
same
business
location.
the
state
law
also
affords
employers
safe
harbors
against
liability
if
they
comply
with
certain
requirements
for
checking
employee
status,
even
if
the
employee
turns
out
to
be
an
unauthorized
alien.
there's
another
aspect
of
the
arizona
law
that
was
challenged
in
this
suit.
irca
also
requires
employers
to
take
steps
to
verify
an
employee's
eligibility
for
employment.
in
an
attempt
to
improve
that
verification
process,
congress
created
what
is
known
as
e-verify,
an
internet
based
system
that
employers
can
use
to
check
the
work
authorization
status
of
employees.
the
arizona
law
requires
employers
to
use
e-verify
to
check
the
work
--
work
authorization
status
of
those
that
they
hire.
contrary
to
the
chamber's
argument,
arizona's
requirement
is
not
preempted.
the
federal
provision
setting
up
e-verify
contains
no
language
limiting
state
use
of
the
program
in
any
way.
the
chamber
argues
that
arizona's
use
of
e-verify
will
bog
down
the
operation
of
the
federal
system
but
the
federal
government
has
expressly
rejected
that
claim.
in
fact,
the
federal
government
encourages
employers
to
use
e-verify.
the
department
of
homeland
security
says
the
program
is,
"the
best
available
means
to
determine
the
employment
eligibility
of
new
hires."
now,
of
course
arizona
hopes
that
its
law
will
result
in
more
effective
enforcement
of
the
prohibition
on
employing
unauthorized
aliens.
but
in
preserving
to
the
states
the
authority
to
impose
sanctions
through
licensing
laws,
congress
did
not
intend
to
preserve
only
those
state
laws
that
would
have
no
effect.
irca
expressly
reserves
to
the
states
the
authority
to
impose
sanctions
on
employers
hiring
unauthorized
workers
through
licensing
and
similar
laws.
that
is
what
arizona
has
done.
it
has
increased
penalties
but
only
for
truly
egregious
violations
of
the
law
and
has
closely
track
the
federal
law
in
determining
who
is
an
unauthorized
alien.
if
even
this
gives
rise
to
impermissible
conflict
with
federal
law,
then
there
really
is
no
way
for
the
state
to
implement
licensing
sanctions
contrary
to
the
expressed
terms
of
the
federal
laws
and
savings
clause.
and
so
we
reject
the
arguments
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
affirm
the
judgement
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
thomas
joined
parts
1,
2
(a)
and
3
(a)
of
the
opinion
and
concurred
in
the
judgement.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joined,
and
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
--
or
decision
of
this
case.
