chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
09-115,
chamber
of
commerce
v.
whiting.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
pose
there,
we've
had
a
little
discussion
about
what
licensing
laws
are,
but
we
haven't
talked
at
all
about
those
last
two
words,
"and
similar
laws".
it
seems
to
me
that
whatever
wiggle
room
or
ambiguity
there
may
be
in
saying
whether
this
is
a
license
or
not,
congress
swept
pretty
broadly.
it
said,
not
just
licensing
laws,
but
licensing
and
similar
laws.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
let
me
just
--
i
mean,
businesses
had
to
have
licensing
laws
pretty
much
across
the
board,
right?
you
couldn't
set
up
a
--
i
don't
know,
an
electrical
contracting
business
if
you
weren't
licensed
to
do
business
or
met
the
requirements
for
an
electrician.
it
wasn't
just
agricultural.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
they
said
and
you
have
to
renew
your
license
every
year
or
every
six
months?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
disagree
that
whether
or
not
a
company
hires
illegal
workers
is
related
to
quality
or
asserted
ability
to
do
business
or
qualification?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
just
so
i
make
sure
i
understand
your
approach.
you're
saying
that
arizona
had
a
law
saying
you
have
to
have
a
license
to
do
business.
and
then
it
became
aware
of
a
problem
that
it
wasn't
aware
of
before,
it
found
out
a
lot
of
employers
were
employing
child
labor
and
they
didn't
know
they
would
do
that.
and
they
say
we
can
revoke
your
license
if
you're
determined
to
have
employed
child
labor,
that
that
would
not
be
okay?
but
it
would
be
okay
if
in
the
original
licensing
thing
they
said
and
you
had
can't
employ
child
labor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
--
excuse
me.
you
tried
earlier
to
talk
about
the
two
boxes
and
you
said
something
would
be
preempted
by
the
first
clause.
anything,
civil
and
criminal
sanctions
are
allowed
if
they
are
imposed
through
licensing
and
similar
laws.
there
are
not
two
boxes.
the
state
can
do
what's
in
the
first
part
so
long
as
it
does
it
through
licensing
or
similar
laws.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
similar
to
a
licensing
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
o'grady.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
--
i
wasn't
quite
sure
what
she
meant.
judge
schrader,
in
her
opinion
for
the
court,
emphasized
that
this
statute
was
being
evaluated
on
its
face
and
that
--
she
said
in
as-applied,
particular
challenges
might
arise.
how
would
that
work?
if
we
determined
this
was
not
preempted,
how
would
--
on
its
face,
how
would
an
as-applied
challenge
come
about?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
you
are
home
free
under
state
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
an
affirmative
defense
under
both.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
except
--
well,
you
are
just
kind
of
blinking
over
the
savings
clause
--
except
through
licensing
and
similar
laws.
so
that
is
not
a
real
reservation
by
congress
of
this
power
to
itself.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
