mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1986
congress
converted
what
had
been
before
that
time
a
merely
peripheral
concern
of
immigration
policy,
that
is
how
to
regulate
worker
authorization,
and
converted
it
into
a
core
concern
of
immigration
policy
by
the
passage
of
the
--
of
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act.
this
court
has
characterized
that
change
in
legislation
as
providing
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
dealing
with
those
issues,
and
that
characterization
is
obviously
apt
because
congress
provided
for
an
exhaustive
and
exclusively
federal
method
of
bringing
to
the
attention
of
federal
authorities,
problems
and
worker
authorization,
the
method
by
which
those
matters
should
be
investigated,
the
method
by
which
they
should
be
adjudicated,
all
of
which
are
controlled
as
a
matter
of
federal,
exclusive
federal
activity;
and
indeed
the
ultimate
judicial
review
goes
exclusively
to
the
federal
courts
of
appeals.
the
sanctioning
provisions
are
very
explicit
and
they
are
very
clear,
and
they
are
very
balanced;
and
for
a
good
reason.
congress
realized
in
this
context
that
if
you
over-enforce
in
one
direction,
that
is
if
you
try
to
deter
the
hiring
of
unauthorized
workers,
you
run
a
very
serious
risk
of
causing
employers
to
err
on
the
side
of
not
hiring
others
who
are
in
fact
authorized
but
who
may
fall
into
protected
classes.
and
so
congress
very
carefully
calibrated
the
penalties
on
both
sides
so
that
the
employer
essentially
would
play
it
straight
down
the
middle
and
hire
the
best
people
for
the
job
under
these
circumstances,
while
of
course
complying
if
at
all
possible
with
the
federal
requirements.
and
so
it's
against
that
backdrop--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
state
statute
has
two
components
to
it.
one
is
knowing
and
one
is
intent.
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
i
don't
see
how
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
part
of
the
problem
is
that
there
--
it
is
never
100
percent
clear
precisely
who
is
and
who
is
not
an
authorized
worker.
and
i
think
what
congress
said
was
--
i'm
not
going
to
deal
with
this
problem
in
the
kind
of
granular
way
you
are
looking
at
it,
justice
scalia,
which
is
specifically
at
each
of
the
individual
employment
decisions.
you
are
going
to
look
at
the
generality
of
situations
and
realize
that
if
you
put
on
one
side
of
the
scale
what
arizona
has
done
here,
which
is
to
say
that
you
can
--
you
can
essentially
have
the
death
penalty
to
the
business,
that
is
complete
eliminate
the
business's
right
to
exist;
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
scale,
a
$250
fine,
it
would
--
it
would
be
pretty
remarkable
to
say,
well,
i'm
going
to
hide
behind
the
intent
and
knowing
requirements
and
instead
simply
avoid
if
at
all
possible
the
risk
of
arizona's
sanctions
being
imposed
upon
me.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'm
quite
sure
that
that's
what
arizona
will
say.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
it
does
ultimately
does
come
down
to
"through
licensing"
laws
and
--
the
--
the
--
part
of
the
--
and
the
fundamental
problem
obviously
with
arizona's
scheme
here
is
that
this
is
not
a
licensing
law.
this
is
a
worker
authorization
sanctioning
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
better
way
to
try
to
--
to
grapple
with
the
meaning
of
the
licensing
law
or
whether
it
ought
to
be
construed
broadly
to
allow
the
state
wide
authority
to
engage
in
supplemental
enforcement
in
this,
or
narrowly
in
order
to
say
that
what
really
ought
to
happen
in
this
context
is,
if
you
deal
with
a
situation
where
the
federal
government
has
enacted
--
i'm
sorry
--
has
enforced
a
provision
and
imposed
a
penalty
through
the
federal
scheme,
that
then
as
a
supplement
to
that
the
state
does
in
fact
have
the
authority
to
add
something
over
and
above
what
it
--
what
the
federal
government
has
done.
but
it
seems
to
me
quite
remarkable
to
think
that
congress
intended
through
a
parenthetical
referring
to
"through
licensing
laws"
to
allow
the
state
to
adopt
an
entire
alternative
shadow
enforcement
mechanism,
non-administrative
decision-making
process,
completely
a
state-run
operation;
and
even
at
the
end,
the
sanction
is
not
--
is
not
imposed
ultimately
in
effect
by
the
--
by
any
regulating
entity.
it
is
ordered
by
a
state
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
scalia,
i
--
i
understand
the
point
and
i
understand
the
motivation
for
why
arizona
did
what
it
did.
but
the
--
the
problem
is
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1986
and
that's
when
the
preemption
standards
were
put
in
place.
and
the
--
again,
the
notion
--
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
structure
of
the
statute
--
and
this
also
responds
in
some
ways
to
justice
kennedy's
question
how
should
you
read
licensing,
since
it's
not
a
self-defining
concept
--
is
if
you
--
is
that
first
congress
said
very
specifically
that
immigration
laws
should
be
enforced
uniformly,
which
says
that
there
shouldn't
be
40,000
different
localities
offering
up
their
view
of
licensing
and
--
and
the
additional
50
states.
second
of
all,
and
this
part
i
think
is
particularly
telling
in
terms
of
this
massive
state
scheme
that's
been
adopted,
which
is
that
under
section
1324a(b)(5)
which
is
in
134a
of
the
--
of
the
appendix,
congress
specifically
outlaws
the
use
of
the
i-9
form.
and
in
some
ways
this
goes
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
because
it
would
be
inconceivable
that
the
state
can
in
fact
enforce
knowing
and
intentional
decisionmaking
without
having
access
to
the
i-9
form,
because
that's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
true,
justice
alito.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
specific
hypothetical
is
that's
still
not
a
licensing
law,
because
it
doesn't
tie
the
grant
of
the
license
to
the
revocation
powers.
i
think
congress
--
i
think
congress
means
for
the
states
to
adopt
something
more
specific
than
that,
although
i
do
think
eventually--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
it
is
a
licensing
law
within
the
meaning
of
what
congress
intended.
i
mean
--
the
--
the
reality
is,
justice
alito,
there
is
--
there
is
no
common
definition
of
license,
and
various
states--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
i
understand
that,
justice
breyer,
and
i
agree
with
that.
but
the
problem
is,
is
that
the
--
the
federal
law,
it
doesn't
talk
about
actions
with
--
with
respect
to
licenses.
it
talks
about
licensing
laws
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
seiu
brief
does
a
very
nice
job
of
explaining
the
--
the
particular
focus
of
congress,
obviously,
on
the
agricultural
workers
protection
act,
and
in
particular
--
which
has
tremendous
significance
in
terms
of
narrowing
the
state's
authority
here,
because
obviously
in
their
conforming
amendments
in
that
context--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
what
it
--
what
congress
actually
had
in
mind
and
what
is
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
licensing
law
is
the
fairly
common
situation
where
somebody
violates
federal
law,
usually
on
the
criminal
side,
and
a
state
licensing
entity
finds
out
about
a
conviction
of
the
federal
crime,
and
says:
oh,
wait
a
second,
we
don't
want
people
to
have
licenses
under
these
circumstances,
and
therefore--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
no,
no.
justice
scalia,
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
that
and
what
they
are
saying.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
actually,
justice
scalia,
can
i
stop
you
there?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
i
think,
actually,
if
you
just
received
the
articles
of
incorporation,
that
doesn't
actually
in
all
states
necessarily
give
you
the
opportunity
to
do
business.
it
just
simply
gives
you
the
right
to
exist,
and
you
may
very
well
need
to
get
a
separate
document
in
order
to
actually
do
business
in
a
particular
state.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
you
don't
need
that.
that's
true.
but
the
reality
is
that
nobody,
i
think
--
and
common
sense
and
common
use
of
the
term,
thinks
of
articles
of
incorporation
or
charter
of
partnership
or
any
of
those
as
documents
--
as
licensing,
which
suggests
that
the
state--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
can't
do
it
in
delaware,
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
the
enforcement
and
investigation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i
think
there
are
three
pieces
of
evidence
that
respond
directly
to
what
you
asked,
justice
sotomayor.
first
is
congress
in
section
115
of
the
statute
specifically
says
enforcement
should
be
uniform,
which
suggests
to
me
that
this
ought
to
be
exclusively
a
federal
investigation
and
--
and
adjudication
process.
two,
the
point
i
was
making
earlier
about
the
i-9
form.
those
forms
cannot
be
used
in
any--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
enforcement
of
the
immigration
laws
shall
be
uniform.
congress
stated
that
as
a
--
as
an
overarching
principle--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--when
it
enacted
section
115.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no,
i
--
i
mean,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
i
can
imagine
a
lot
of
--
i
mean,
this
is
--
remember,
we
are
talking
about
immigration
policy
and
immigration
law
here,
and
in
general,
you
would
expect
that
to
be
pretty
much
uniform.
but
this
court
in
de
canas
had
decided
that
there
are
some
elements
of
it
that
were
not,
and
congress
is
simply
reinforcing
the
basic
notion
that
enforcement
of
it
ought
to
be
uniform.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
--
but,
justice
alito,
i
think
that's
why
it's
terribly
important
to
limit,
to
narrow
as
much
as
possible
--
and
it's
fully
consistent
with
congressional
intent
--
the
need
to
get
a
full
sanction
done
by
the
federal
government
and
then
just
an
add-on
on
the
licensing
side,
rather
than
an
entire
regime
to
enforce
state
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
there
--
but
only
at
that
point.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
investigate.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
sotomayor.
and
--
and
the
last
thing
i
would
say
to
that
was
the
conforming
amendments
with
respect
to
the
agricultural
workers'
protection
act
was
the
situation
where
the
department
of
labor,
which
used
to
engage
in
adjudication
as
well,
was
divested
of
that
authority.
it
seems
quite
unlikely
congress
meant
to
give
that
authority
to
the
states
and
take
it
from
the
department
of
labor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
arizona
doesn't
purport--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
arizona
doesn't
purport
to
be
enforcing
federal
law
here.
it
has
an
independent
state
law
basis
for
the
actions
that
it
takes.
so
that
would
not
arise
under
federal
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
it
--
actually,
i
don't
think
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
tracks
it,
but
it
doesn't
incorporate
it.
it
doesn't
purport
to
be
applying
it.
it's
the
same
standards,
but
it's
still
a
matter
of
state
law.
it's
not
a
federal
--
it's
not
federal
--
it
doesn't
arise
under
federal
law.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
once
again,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
begin
frankly
where
justice
sotomayor
pointed
me
to
before,
which
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
really
is
a
basis
for
allowing
the
states
to
independently
investigate
and
to
independently
adjudicate
these
matters.
and
what
is
the
evidence
that
congress
did
not
intend
that?
justice
breyer
quoted
from
the
house
report,
recognizing
not
everybody
accepts
that;
but
it
does
seem
to
me
to
articulate
a
very
commonsense
limitation
that
says
you
have
to
have
a
federal
adjudication
in
the
first
instance
and
once
you
have
got
that
then
the
state
is
allowed
to
add
that
sanction.
that
--
that
principle
it
seems
to
me
is
reinforced
by
the
limitation
on
what
you
can
use
the
i-9
for.
justice
alito,
you
asked
that
question,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
quite
clear
that
what
congress
envisioned
in
1986
when
it
adopted
this
is
you
are
going
to
have
an
exclusively
federal
enforcement
scheme
including
the
adjudicatory
process,
and
it
is
only
in
that
context
you
are
allowed
to
use
the
i-9,
and
the
notion
that
the
state
could
adopt
a
standard
of
intentional
or
knowingly,
and
not
be
able
to
have
the
i-9
materials
available
seems
flatly
at
odds
with
each
other,
and
therefore
it
cannot
be
that
congress
intended
under
those
circumstances
to
allow
these
matters
to
be
adjudicated
in
that
particular
fashion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
--
it
seems
to
me
the
easiest
--
and
of
course,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
arizona
does
--
but
the
easiest
is,
if
a
--
an
employer
is
convicted
of
--
of
violating
irca
and
a
criminal
sanction,
and
he
happens
to
be
a
barber,
and
the
state
licensing
law
says
if
you
are
convicted
of
a
--
of
a
federal
crime
you
will
lose
your
license,
it
is
available
to
the
state
under
those
circumstances
--
and
i
think
this
is
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind
--
to
issue
a
notice
to
show
cause
why
that
particular
person
shouldn't
have
the
license
revoked
and
then
go
from
there.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
scalia--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well
no,
but
justice
scalia,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
question
here
--
and
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
pre-emption
can
be
a
moving
target.
i
think
you
have
to
decide
it
on
a
basis
of
what
congress
had
in
front
of
it
in
1986.
but
remember,
congress
was
balancing
three,
at
least,
very
difficult
problems:
minimizing
problems
on
the
employers,
minimizing
discrimination
against
people
who
are
permitted
to
be
hired,
and
avoiding
hiring
people
who
are
not
permitted
to
do
so.
and
how
you
properly
reconcile
that
is
very
difficult,
but
the
one
thing
that
seems
to
me
clear
is
that
that
was
a
choice
that
congress
meant
to
leave
to
itself
and
to
the
federal
government
to
sort
out
and
not
to
give
the
states
the
opportunity
to
come
in
where
they
did.
and
just
say
one
last
word
e-verify--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
if
you
--
if
you
interpret
the
savings
clause
as
i
do,
which
means
truly
as
a
supplement
to
federal
--
federal
adjudication,
then
it
is
a
very
narrow
limitation
on
that
basis,
because
at
that
point
you
have
already
invoked
the
entirety
of
the
federal
scheme
and
it
doesn't
modify
the
balance
on
those
broader
legal
issues,
your
honor.
