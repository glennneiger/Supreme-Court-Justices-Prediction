justice
stephen
g.
breyer
actually,
there
is.
i
mean,
i
--
it
seemed
to
me
when
i
read
this,
it
sounded
a
little
familiar,
and
i
think
whoever
wrote
it
in
arizona
copied
it
out
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
mean,
you
read
the
definition
of
"license"
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
this
is
awfully
close.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
it
might
have
meant
something
different;
congress
might
have.
but
what
is,
then
--
i
read
the
sciu
brief.
i
thought
that
was
pretty
interesting.
is
that
something
you
adopt
as
what
the
congress
did
mean?
i
mean,
what
do
you
think
congress
did
mean,
and
what
evidence
is
there?
if
it
didn't
mean
the
apa
definition,
what
evidence
is
there
for
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
main
--
the
main
anomaly
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
this,
that
in
the
federal
act,
as
--
that
was
the
first
point
that
the
chamber
made,
that
it's
a
fairly
careful
balance.
there
are
a
group
of
people
in
arizona,
they
may
look
as
if
they
come
from
mexico
or
speak
with
an
hispanic
accent,
and
you
are
not
certain
whether
they
in
fact
are
illegals
or
that
they
are
legal.
now,
think
of
that
category.
congress
has
passed
a
statute
that
gives
the
employer
just
as
much
incentive
to
verify,
so
there
is
no
discrimination,
as
to
dismiss,
so
there
is
no
illegal
hiring.
it's
absolutely
balanced.
a
$1,000
fine
for
the
one,
a
$1,000
fine
for
the
other.
so
arizona
comes
along
and
says:
i'll
tell
you
what,
if
you
discriminate,
you
know
what
happens
to
you,
nothing?
but
if
you
hire
an
illegal
immigrant,
your
business
is
dead.
that's
just
one
thing
they
do.
now,
how
can
you
reconcile
that
intent
to
prevent
discrimination
against
people
because
of
their
appearance
or
accent
--
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
arizona's
law?
if
you
are
a
businessman,
every
incentive
under
that
law
is
to
call
close
questions
against
hiring
this
person.
under
the
federal
law
every
incentive
is
to
look
at
it
carefully.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
i-9
--
i
do
have
a
question
on
the
i-9.
i'm
not
certain.
i
thought
under
federal
law
that
if
the
employee
--
the
employer
isn't
certain,
but
the
employee
says,
here's
my
social
security
card,
here's
the
driver's
license.
the
employer
looks
at
that,
he's
home
free,
is
that
right?
but
under
federal
--
under
your
law,
under
arizona
law,
he's
not
home
free,
and,
moreover
--
because
he
--
it
may
--
he's
not
home
free,
he
still
could
be
prosecuted.
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
shows
the
driver's
license
under
--
under
arizona
law,
if
the
--
if
he
shows
a
driver's
license
and
social
security
card,
the
worker,
the
employer
looks
at
it,
the
employer
cannot
be
prosecuted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
--
i
thought
in
reading
it
that
it
creates
some
kind
of
presumption,
but
he's
not
home
free?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
under
federal
law
he
is
home
free.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
he's
home
free?
look,
i
don't
--
i'm
trying
to
understand.
maybe
there
is
not
enough
time
to
explain
it,
but
i
thought
federal
law
requires
this
e-9
business
or
whatever
that
e
review
is.
and
i
was
worried
about
the
e
review
which
it
seemed
to
require
because
it
seemed
to
me
in
20
percent
of
the
cases
where
the
notice
is,
this
guy
is
not
authorized;
we
don't
have
any
record
that
he
is
authorized
to
work
--
20
percent
of
those
are
wrong
and
he
is
authorized
to
work.
so
the
employer
who
follows
that
is
really
going
to
fire
20
percent
of
the
people
who
will
be
absolutely
entitled
to
work.
and
so
i
would
just
like
to
you
address
those
points,
as
you
wish.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
fail
to
do
it,
then
they
cannot
receive
any,
quote,
"grant,
loan,
or
performance-based
incentive.
"
end
quote,
from
the
state.
that's
what
the
law
says,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
think
that
the
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
is,
yes,
there
is
that
penalty.
it
isn't
simply
hortatory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
go
to
jail.
what
you
do
is
you
lose
any
grant,
loan,
or
performance-based
incentive.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
i
was
looking
at
specifically
is
"federal
law
says".
if
you
look
at
the
driver's
license
and
social
security
card,
those
are
i-9
docs.
then
the
employer
has
established
an
affirmative
defense
and
has
not
violated
the
law.
that's
what
it
says
at
cite
27a,
okay?
that
is
the
federal
law.
arizona
law
that
i
was
reading
--
maybe
there's
another
place
i
should
read
--
is
it
says,
in
determining
whether
there
is
an
unauthorized
alien,
the
court
shall
consider
the
federal
government's
determination.
it
creates
a
rebuttable
presumption.
that
means
it
might
be
rebutted.
okay.
so
i
see
a
difference
there.
and
the
reason
that
that's
relevant
is
because
of
my
first
question.
if
you
are
an
employer,
prior
to
your
law,
it's
50/50.
i
better
verify
because
if
i
am
discriminating,
you
know,
da,
da,
da,
and
it's
not
that
hard.
i
just
look
at
the
drivers'
license
and
i
look
at
--
and
i'm
home
free,
and
the
social
security
card,
and
if
i
hire
an
illegal
immigrant,
the
same
thing,
da,
da,
da.
okay?
so
same
both
ways.
so,
your
law.
employer,
look
at
the
driver's
license
and
social
security,
you
are
not
home
free.
employer,
if
it
turns
out
that
you
have
been
hiring
this
illegal
immigrant
and
he's
not
an
american,
your
business
is
finished.
but
what
happens
if
i
discriminate,
under
our
law?
nothing.
now,
that
is
the
original
point
they
made.
that's
why
i
brought
up
this
question
of
difference
in
standards.
and
i
want
to
be
absolutely
clear
what
your
answer
to
that
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
where?
where
is
it
in
the
statute,
then?
because
what
i
read
were
the
words
"rebuttable
presumption",
and
i
might
be
reading
the
wrong
words.
so
tell
me
where
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
thank
you.
i
see
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
main
point
--
i
will
check
that.
but
i
think
maybe
i
was
mistaken,
perhaps,
and
that
i
was
looking
at
the
other
section.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
we
are
still
stuck
with
this
enormous
discrepancy
in
penalty.
i
mean,
i'm
characterizing
it
as
enormous,
but
it
seems
like,
you
know,
it's
even
on
discrimination
versus
under
the
federal
law.
it's
not
even,
your
business
is
out
to
lunch,
gone
and
on
the
other
side
it
has
nothing.
what
about
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
savings
clause
itself,
the
word
licensing,
not
everyone
looks
at
this,
but
i
did
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
when
you
look
at
that
paragraph
on
page
39
of
the
red
brief,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
paragraph
says
what
it
means.
it
says
precisely
what
it
is.
it
says
--
the
first
thing
it
says
is
that,
look,
if
you
are
found
to
have
violated
this.
where
is
it?
it's
page,
there
it
is.
suppose
somebody's
been
found
to
have
violated
the
sanctions
provision
in
the
federal
legislation.
he
has
been
found
by
the
federal
government,
then
what
the
state
does,
it
can
revoke
his
license.
okay.
that's
one
thing.
and
the
second
thing
it
says,
it
doesn't
want
to
preempt
fitness
to
do
business
laws,
such
as
state
farm
labor
contracting
laws
or
forestry
laws.
in
other
words,
its
thinking
of
some
precise
set
of
licenses.
and
that's
why
this
licensing
thing
was
there
and
the
very
next
participant
of
this
federal
law
are
conforming
amendments
and
those
conforming
amendments
apply.
the
departments
of
government
that
were
concerned
with
maintaining
state
farm
labor
contractual
laws.
now,
i
grant
you,
you
have
to
go
beyond
the
text,
but
some
of
us
do
because
we
get
enlightenment.
and
going
beyond
that
text,
it
seems
to
me
we
should
go
follow
what
that
house
report
says.
now,
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
said
yes,
i
got
broad
licensing
--
but
let's
deal
with
the
part
where
you
look
at
their
explanation
as
to
why
they
put
those
words
there.
