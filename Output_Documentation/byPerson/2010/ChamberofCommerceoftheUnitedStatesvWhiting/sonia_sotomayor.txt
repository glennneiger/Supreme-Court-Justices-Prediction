justice

could
i
--
could
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--just
--
just
focus
the
question?
because
we
keep
talking
about
whether
the
apa-type
definition
of
licensing
is
what
congress
intended
or
not,
but
you
don't
disagree
that
congress
at
least
intended
that
if
someone
violated
the
federal
law
and
hired
illegal
aliens
of
hispanic
--
undocumented
aliens
and
was
found
to
have
violated
it,
that
the
state
can
revoke
their
license,
correct,
to
do
business?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
they
are
revoking
their
right
to
do
business
in
the
state.
and
they
can
only
revoke
their
charter
or
their
articles
of
incorporation
if
they're
--
if
they
were
filed
in
that
state.
they
wouldn't
have
power
to
revoke
a
delaware--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--all
right.
so
it's
stopping
them
from
doing
business.
so
really,
the
only
conflict
you
are
talking
about
is
not
the
power
to
stop
them
from
doing
business,
because
you
accept
that
this
saving
clause
gives
them
the
power
to
do
that,
to
revoke
the
right
to
do
business.
what
you
are
talking
about
is
a
conflict
in
the
adjudication
of
that
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i'm
--
you
know,
how
they
define
"license"
or
not
is
irrelevant
to
me.
walk
me
through
whether
--
what
expressly
preempts
that
adjudication
right--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--or
what
implicitly
preempts
that
adjudication
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
that
is,
for
me,
what
the
center
of
this
question
is.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it
can't
be
uniformity
of
sanction,
because
the
court
permitted
licensing
sanctions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
let's
go
back
to
my
question
of
adjudication.
what
you
are
saying
is
what's
specifically
preempted
is
the
right
to
adjudicate--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--whether
someone
has
hired
undocumented
aliens,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
argument
sounds
to
me
like,
look
at
the
law
and
see
what
its
purpose
is.
if
the
purpose
is
to
regulate
undocumented
aliens,
then
it's
struck
down.
if
it
happens
to
put
its
revocation
provisions
in
its
licensing
law,
then
its
okay.
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
face
of
the
statute
talks
only
about
if
you
hire
undocumented
aliens
your
license
is
revoked.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
savings
clause
says
that
it
is
okay.
civil
or
criminal
sanctions
other
than
through
licensing
and
similar
laws.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
we
disagree
with
you,
could
you
answer
the
question
i
posed
to
your
adversary,
which
is
what
makes
the
adjudication
of
status
preempted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
there
were
many,
many
state
laws
that
adjudicated
revocation
of
licenses.
perhaps
not
many
have
addressed
the
issue
of
hiring
undocumented
aliens,
but
many
state
laws
existed
that
independently
adjudicated
revocations.
what
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
words
of
the
statute
show
that
congress
intended
in
any
way
to
limit
those
adjudications?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
--
doesn't
it
frustrate
the
congressional
intent
when
the
federal
law
says
that
the
i-9
can
be
used
for
no
purpose
other
than
the
federal
adjudication
of
whether
a
violation
has
occurred
or
not?
doesn't
it
frustrate
that
law
to
have
the
states
raise
a
defense
that
depends
on
forcing
someone
to
disclose
something
that
the
federal
law
protects?
i
mean,
this
is
a
vicious
circle.
federal
law
says
you
can't
do
the
i-9,
you
can't
use
it
for
any
purpose
other
than
the
federal
adjudication.
now
you
are
creating
a
defense
that
says,
you
have
to
supply
us
with
something
that
federal
law
otherwise
protects
from
disclosure.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
doesn't
answer
my
point.
doesn't
it
frustrate
federal
law
when
the
federal
law
says
that
i-9
can
be
used
for
no
purpose
other
than
the
federal
adjudication
of
the
status
of
employees?
i
think
that's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
earlier
question,
in
fact,
relying
on
the
i-9
does
not
provide
a
safe
harbor,
because
under
the
e-verify
system
you
can't
just
rely
on
the
i-9
forms
and
statutes.
you
have
to
rely
on
the
e-verify.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
wouldn't
it
be
easier,
if
that
is
justice
scalia's
concern,
to
take
the
solicitor
general's
position,
that
if
you
are
adjudicating
good
faith
or
intent
differently
in
any
way
from
the
federal
government,
that
it's
granted?
isn't
that
what
waiting
for
an
as-applied
challenge
means,
whether
or
not
you
are
putting
different
requirements
on
proving
good
faith?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
let
me
ask
the
question
directly.
if
arizona's
system
does
not
permit
an
employer
to
rely
on
non-suspect
documents,
the
i-9
documents
that
are
permitted
employers
to
rely
on,
the
arizona
system
says,
no,
you
can't
rely
on
those.
is
that
preempted
or
not?
you
can't
rely
on
i-9,
or
the
arizona
system
says
--
on
the
i-9
documents.
or
the
arizona
system
says,
you
can't
hire
someone
who
hasn't
been
approved
under
the
e-verification
system.
is
that
preempted?
