ms.
mary
r
o'grady
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
through
their
police
powers,
states
traditionally
have
the
authority
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
employers
within
their
jurisdiction
to
determine
what
conduct
warrants
issuance
of
a
state
license
and
to
determine
what
conduct
justifies
suspending
or
revoking
such
a
license.
and
although
congress
preempted
some
of
our
traditional
authority
when
it
enacted
irca
in
1986,
it
preserved
significant
state
authority
through
the
savings
clause
that
permits
a
state
to
impose
sanctions
through
licensing
and
similar
laws.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
your
honor,
we
think
that
looking
at
the
savings
clause
--
we
don't
view
it
as
an
anomaly.
the
structure
that
congress
established
is
one
that
the
state's
authority
is
determined
by
the
nature
of
the
sanction
that
we
choose
to
impose.
we
don't
have
the
authority
to
--
they
--
they
took
away
our
authority
to
impose
civil
monetary
and
criminal
sanctions,
but
preserved
our
authority
to
impose
sanctions
under
this
law.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
well,
i
think
it
makes
sense,
your
honor,
because
in
terms
of
licensing,
it
--
it
provides
some
accountability,
because
we
are
the
entities
that
establish
policy
for
our
licensees
and
we
are
the
ones
accountable
for
whether
that
business
remains
in
business
or
whether
we
are
taking
it
away
from
them.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
your
honor,
certainly
we
waited
until
2007.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
perhaps.
but
i
think
also
that
congress
was
recognizing
what
this
court
recognized
in
de
canas,
was
that
unauthorized
employment
has
significant
local
consequences,
so
they
did
not
want
to
fully
preempt
state
law.
they
wanted
to
preserve
the
authority--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--your
honor,
a
couple
of
points.
first
in
terms
of
how
our
law
works,
we
do
have
a
prohibition
against
investigating
any
complaint
that
is
based
solely
upon
race.
so
if
we
get
a
complaint
that
says
those
people
all
look
mexican
or
hispanic,
that
does
not
get
investigated
under
arizona
law,
first.
we
also
have
criminal
penalties
if
frivolous
complaints
are
filed.
beyond
that,
we
have
the
use
of
e-verify
which
is
an
added
protection
for
employers
to
prevent
the
hiring
of
unauthorized
aliens.
so
if
they
use
e-verify,
if
they
are
in
good
faith
compliance
with
the
i-9
process,
they
have
no
risk
of
exposure
under
arizona
law
just
as
true
under
federal
law.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
the
federal
law
prohibits
the
use
of
an
i-9
--
of
the
i-9
--
an
employer's
use
of
the
i-9
in
a
state
proceeding,
that
these
can
be
used
under
the
federal
proceeding
or
in
the
state.
but
beyond
that,
if
at
some
point
in
an
actual
enforcement
action
it
was
determined
that
federal
law
did
have
that
impact,
they
would
still
have
that
defense
available
to
them.
they
would
just
have,
to
you
know,
prove
it
up
in
a
different
way
other
than
use
the
form.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
here's
--
here
is
what
the
law
says:
it
may
not
be
used
for
purposes
other
than
for
enforcement
of
this
chapter.
and
we
believe
that
a
state
enforcement
action
under
the
authority
for
preserving
sanctions
through
licensing
and
similar
laws,
would
fall
within
that.
so
we
think
they
should
be
able
to
use
that;
the
employer
should
be
able
to
use
that.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
that's
true,
your
honor.
that--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--no,
that
is
not
right,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
well,
your
honor--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--we
would
need
the
evidence
that
the
person
knowingly
employed
the
unauthorized
alien,
and
a
good
faith
defense--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--no,
your
honor.
the
--
but
the
substantive--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--the
substantive
requirements
under
arizona
law
and
federal
law
are
the
same.
we
are
imposing
no
new
obligations.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
okay.
and
let
me
walk
through
how
our
law
works
to
see
if
this
addresses
the
concern.
so
the
--
arizona
doesn't
change
anything
in
terms
of
the
use
of
the
i-9.
we
retain
the
same
defense
that
is
in
the
federal
law
for
good
faith
compliance
with
the
i-9.
we
do
require
employers
to
use
e-verify
although
we
don't
impose
a
sanction
on
the
employer
if
they
don't
use
e-verify.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
we
think
the
--
that
question
is
answered
by
looking
at
the
conflict
preemption
analysis,
because
congress
didn't
address
the
role
of
the
states
with
regard
to
e-verify.
and
we
aren't--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--your
honor,
we
can
--
as
long
as
it's
not
a
burden
to
the
objectives
of
congress,
we
think
that
we
can
require
employers
within
our
jurisdiction
to
use
e-verify.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
well,
our
statute
says
you
shall
use
e-verify.
we
don't
impose
a
penalty
against
employers
who
fail
to
use
it.
the
consequences
are
the
same
as
they
are
under
federal
law.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
that's
right.
you
don't
get
the
safe
harbor
under
e-verify.
now
--
for
the
use
of
e-verify.
we
did
add
after
this
lawsuit
was
filed
some
additional
requirements
similar
to
what
they
have
under
the
federal
system
where
you
can't
get
state
contracts,
you
can't
get
state
grants.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
well,
again,
we
look
at
the
test
for
conflict
preemption
in
terms
of,
does
this
make
it
impossible
to
comply
with
federal
law?
no,
it
is
really
a
question
of,
are
we
interfering
with
congress's
--
excuse
me,
the
federal
government's
ability
to
achieve
its
goals?
and
the
goal
in
developing
e-verify
is
to
have
a
more
effective
verification
system.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
that's
what
--
and
that
was
added
after
this
lawsuit
was
filed.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
well,
there's
no
penalty
in
terms
of--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--that
is
true
under
current
law.
that
is
not
what
the
plaintiffs'
challenge--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--it
does
not,
your
honor.
they
just
challenge
the--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--that's
right.
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
well,
your
honor,
we
have
the
same
--
it's
modelled
after
the
federal
law.
so
just
as
federal
law
has
a
defense
for
employers
who
in
good
faith
follow
i-9,
so
does
the
state
law.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
and
justice
alito,
we
haven't
wrestled
that
in
practical
application,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
them
reaching
that
point
under
the
federal
system,
either,
but
--
because
it
does
seem
at
some
point,
if
you
--
that
the
system
should
work,
that
if
you
have
used
i-9
and
you
get
back
a
final
non-confirmation,
not
a
tentative
non-confirmation,
that
that
employee
is
unauthorized,
that
that,
you
know,
seems
like
it
should
carry
greater
weight
in
an
enforcement
action.
but
as
a
--
as
an
--
on
an
as-applied
basis,
i'm
not
sure
how
that
plays
out
in
an
actual
enforcement
action.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
i
think,
your
honor,
perhaps
if
we
--
perhaps
in
terms
of
what
are
the
outer
limits
of
our
definition
of
"license",
and
they
were
saying
that
we
are
outside
the
definition
of
licensing
and
similar
laws,
in
a
particular
case,
perhaps
that
would
be
an
as-applied
type
challenge.
i
think
some
of
the
i-9
concerns
are
perhaps
more
appropriately
resolved
in
a
--
in
a
direct
case
where
that
issue
has
arisen
on
an
as-applied
basis,
and
i
think
she
was
concerned
about
some
of
the
real
implementation
questions
that
were
wrapped
into
the
legal
challenge.
but
for
the
most
part,
i
think
the
general
framework
of
our
statute
is
appropriate
for
--
in
this
challenge.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
your
honor,
my
hope
is
that
we--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--my
hope
is,
your
honor,
that
we
get
sufficient
guidance.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
no,
your
honor,
and
--
because
i
was
trying
to
give
some
examples
of
the
kinds
of
things
that
may
come
up
as
a
practical
matter,
but
i
think
we
can
get
the
guidance
from
this
court.
i
hope
we
can
proceed
in
implementation--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--i
think
those
would
both
be
problems.
i
think
we
need
to
be
consistent
with
the
--
the
structure
and
the
obligations
that
are
imposed
under
federal
law
in
terms
of
our
sanctions
provisions.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
because
i
think
what
congress
preserved
for
us
was
our
ability
to
impose
sanctions,
including
the
suspension
and
revocation
of
state
laws.
but
i
do
think
they
established
a
uniform
national
standard.
i
don't
think
we
could,
for
example,
establish
a
strict
liability
offense
in
arizona.
we
would
have
to
have
a
scienter
requirement
as
they
have
in
federal
law.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
and
i
am
hoping
i
am
being
clear,
justice
breyer.
we
have
the
same
standards
as
federal
law.
we
have
the
same
i-9
defense
that's
in
federal
law.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
okay.
let
me
get
to
it,
and
let
me
explain
our
rebuttable
presumption
while
i
find
the
specific
statutory
cite.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
and
178(a)
is
the
provision
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
section,
employer
that
establishes
it
has
complied
in
good
faith
with
the
requirements
of
8
u.s.c.
1324a(b),
establishes
an
affirmative
defense,
et
cetera.
so
that
is
the
provision
that
provides
the
i-9
defense.
the
rebuttable
presumption
issue
and
this
is
how
that
comes
into
play.
we
have
to,
in
bringing
an
enforcement
action,
have
to
rely,
the
state
in
making
its
case,
has
to
rely
on
information
from
the
federal
government
regarding
whether
someone
is
authorized
or
unauthorized.
we
have
to
rely
on
that
information
from
the
federal
government.
we
bring
our
action
in
state
court
if
we
have
verification
from
the
federal
government
that
that
person
is
unauthorized.
we
have
additional
information
that
we've
established
the
scienter
requirement,
then
we
bring
our
action.
but
the
employer
has
an
opportunity
to
rebut
the
evidence
that
we've
presented
in
a
state
court
proceeding.
it
may
be,
you
know,
that
person
doesn't
work
for
us
or
some
other
type
of
evidence.
so
that
is
the
role
of
that
rebuttable
presumption,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
certainly.
so
in
terms
of
the
prior
adjudication--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--and
our
standards
are
the
same.
in
subsection
j,
which
we
have
the
i-9
affirmative
defense--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--to
the
extent
that
you
should
be
home
free
and
you
would
have
the
benefit
of
that
good
faith
defense.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
that's
right.
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
is
the
natural
consequence
of
the
savings
clause
that
congress
itself
wrote--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--well,
first,
of
course,
we
would
focus
on
the
text
where
congress
could
have
but
did
not--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--okay.
first,
the
farm
labor
contractor
is
simply
an
example,
and
i
think
it
says
such
as
an
example
of
the
type
of
licensing
provisions
that
existed
at
this
time
that
addressed
that.
so
that's
not
an
all
inclusive
universe
of
the
sanctions
--
of
the
licensing
laws
that
might
be
subject
to
this.
they
also
don't
specifically
say
there
has
to
be
a
prior
federal
adjudication.
the
sentence
has
passive
voice,
has
been
determined
without
specifying
who
is
making
that
determination
and
it
specifically
refers
to
state
and
local
processes
that
provide
for
the
suspension
and
revocation
of
state
licenses.
and
then
there
is
a
following
sentence
that
says,
you
know,
further,
we
don't
intend
to
disrupt
laws
such
as
these
forestry
and
other,
you
know,
fitness
to
do
business.
we
think
this
is
a
fitness
to
do
business
law,
in
that
we
are
establishing
as
a
state
standard
that
if
you
engage
in
this
conduct
of
knowingly
employing
unauthorized
aliens
we
are
going
to
have
the
ability
to
take
an
action
against
that
license
that
we
have
given
you
to
do
business
in
our
jurisdiction.
so
we
think
we
fit
within
that
last
sentence
of
the--
ms.
mary
r
o'grady
--they
work
in
our
system,
your
honor,
as
they
do
under
the
federal
law,
under
--
that
you
get
a
rebuttable
presumption
if
you
--
in
your
favor
if
you
used
e-verify,
the
affirmative
defense
if
you've
used
i-9.
and
i
am
--
there
is
that
caution;
it
is
good
faith
use
of
--
of
the
i-9
system.
we
do
have
examples
where
for
example
if
an
employer
is
terminated
because
they
are
unauthorized
and
they
show
up
with
a
different
name
and
different
papers
2
weeks
later,
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
establish
your
good
faith.
so
you
are
home
free
but
subject
to
that
good
faith
limitation.
but
we
do
incorporate
the
same
obligations
that
exist
under
federal
law.
and
also,
i
wanted
to
address
more
on
the
farm
labor
contractors
and
the
amendments
and
what
we
think
that
we
are
doing
in
those
amendments
was
simply
dividing
responsibility
at
the
federal
level
between
the
department
of
labor
and
their
processes
that
preexisted
irca,
and
what
they
were
establishing
in
irca,
and
said
we
are
not
going
to
have
these
determinations
of
whether
they
--
the
farm
labor
contractor
has
employed
an
unauthorized
alien
through
a
department
of
labor
process;
we
are
going
to
instead
use
the
irca-established
process.
but
importantly
what
congress
did
not
change
in
the
agricultural
worker
regulations
was
the
provision
that
addresses
state
law.
it
said
before
irca
and
after
irca
that
those
laws
--
those
federal
laws
only
supplement
the
authority
of
the
states;
and
that
means
that
they
preserved
all
of
the
states'
authority
that
they
had
before
irca
in
the
area
of
farm
labor
contractors.
and
that
i
think
is
reinforced
by
the
legislative
history
that
--
that
again
reinforces
that
those
have
been
preserved
through
irca.
this
is
an
area
that
has
traditionally
been
within
the
mainstream
of
state
police
power.
we
acknowledge
that
congress
does
have
the
authority
to
preempt
us,
but
they
left
important
discretion
in
terms
of
our
ability
to
impose
sanctions
through
licensing
and
similar
laws,
and
we
are
doing
so
by
establishing
this
scheme
that
provides
for
the
suspension
and
revocation
of
state
licenses.
it's
an
important
part
of
the
balance
that
congress
struck
when
it
enacted
irca
by
addressing
what
state
authority
would
exist
after
that
congressional
enactment.
we
think
the
lower
courts
properly
determined
the
scope
of
that
provision
and
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
thank
you
for
your
attention
this
morning.
