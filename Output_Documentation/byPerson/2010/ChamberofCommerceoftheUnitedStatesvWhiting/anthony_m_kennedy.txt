justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
i
picked
up
this
--
this
brief
and
looked
at
this
case,
i
thought:
oh,
well,
licensing,
that
is
a
defined
term;
i
will
look
in
corpus
juris
secundum
or
alr
or
something.
but
it
really
isn't.
your
brief
indicates
you
start
with
dictionaries,
fair
enough.
you
indicate
what
federal
licensing
laws
are.
but
i
see
no
limitation
on
what
the
state
can
decide
is
a
license
in
any
jurisprudential
principle
that
you
cited.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
--
this
is
the
same
question
you
are
answering.
why
is
it
suddenly
not
a
license
because
the
--
because
the
state
imposes
an
additional
condition,
where
it
was
a
license
before?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
chief
justice
insists
on
an
answer
to
his
own
question,
but
it
seems
to
me
his
question
is
why
isn't
that
still
a
licensing
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
the
child
labor
example,
why
isn't
that
an
addition
to
a
regulatory
licensing
scheme
so
that
it's
a
licensing
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
underlying
justice
ginsburg's
question
is
why
would
congress
want
to
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
are
taking
the
mechanism
that
congress
said
will
be
a
pilot
program
that
is
optional
and
you
are
making
it
mandatory.
it
seems
to
me
that's
almost
a
classic
example
of
a
state
doing
something
that
is
inconsistent
with
a
federal
requirement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
so
you
know,
i
interpret
your
answer
as
confirming
the
implication
of
justice
breyer's
questions
that
there
is
a
very
substantial
difference
in
federal
and
state
law
on
this
point.
i
mean,
you
told
about
--
you
know
what
lawsuits
are
about.
if
you
are
home
free,
a
driver's
license
and
social
security
inspection
under
federal
law
and
you're
not
under
state
law,
that
is
a
difference.
