justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
a
problem
if,
as
--
as
the
federal
statute
requires
and
the
state
statutes
require,
you
--
you
have
to
show
an
intent
to
hire
an
unauthorized
worker?
isn't
--
isn't
that
what
the
state
statutes
here
require?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
why
is
that
a
problem
for
--
for
the
business?
i
mean
he's
safe
so
long
as
he
doesn't
intentionally
hire
an
unauthorized
worker.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
what
arizona
would
answer
to
that
is:
well,
that's
the
only
option
the
federal
government
left
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
excluded
everything
else.
we
might
have
used
reticulated
penalties
or,
you
know,
enforced
the
federal
law
ourselves,
but
they
forbade
that.
but
they
did
allow
us
to
enforce
the
law,
immigration
laws,
through
licensing,
right?
so
it
all
essentially
comes
down
to
--
to
the
licensing
issue,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
remarkable
only
because
nobody
would
think
that
with
this
scheme
in
place,
the
federal
government
would
not
enforce
it.
of
course
no
one
would
have
expected
that.
but
what
arizona
says
has
occurred
here
is
that
the
scheme
in
place
has
not
been
enforced,
and
arizona
and
other
states
are
in
serious
trouble
financially
and
for
other
reasons
because
of
--
of
unrestrained
immigration.
and
therefore,
they
had
to
take
this
very
massive
--
i
agree
this
step
is
massive,
and
one
wouldn't
have
expected
it
to
occur
under
this
statute,
but
expectations
change
when
the
federal
government
has
--
has
simply
not
enforced
the
immigration
restrictions.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
have
named
that,
if
that's
it
meant.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
have
named
that,
that
particular
licensing
scheme,
if
that's
what
it
meant.
but
it
didn't
name
it.
it
said
licensing
generally.
what
did
it
intend
to
add
to
that?
barbers'
licenses,
beauticians'
licenses?
how
would
any
of
this
have
anything
to
do
with
the
immigration
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
they
are
saying.
that's
exactly
what
they
are
saying.
we
--
we
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
it's
very
common
to
talk
about
authority
to
do
business
within
a
state
as
--
as
a
license.
you
say
"licensed
to
do
business
in"
so
many
states.
it's
a
common
expression.
now,
i
have
--
maybe
you
will
persuade
me
otherwise,
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
insofar
as
this
law
limits
the
authority
to
do
business
within
the
state,
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
licensing
law.
it's
a
little
harder
extending
licensing
to
formation
of
a
corporation,
but
when
you
issue
a
corporation
charter
you
really
do
two
things.
you
create
the
corporation
and
enable
the
limitation
of
liability
that
creates;
and
secondly,
you
authorize
that
new
creature
to
do
business
within
your
state.
so
at
least
half
of
that
corporation
law
is
licensing,
it
seems
to
me.
now,
if
that's
what
i
think,
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
go
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
do
not
need
the
kind
of
a
document
that
an
out-of-state
corporation
needs.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
don't
depart
from
that.
what
does
that
mean,
"enforcement
shall
be
uniform"?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
mean,
"enforcement
shall
be
uniform"?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
any
different
from--
justice
antonin
scalia
--from
what
is
the
assumed
situation
with
respect
to
all
federal
rules?
are
federal
laws
not
to
be
applied
uniformly?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
the
problem
in
diverse
adjudication.
wouldn't
there
be
a
federal
question
presented
if
a
company
claimed
that
it
was
deprived
of
the
ability
to
do
business
because
of
a
mistaken
interpretation
of
federal
law,
that
the
person
it
hired
was
not
an
authorized
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
that
be
a
federal
question
that
--
that
could
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--doesn't
the
state
law
basis
refer
to
the
federal
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
tracked
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
are
you
saying,
and
i
think
the
petitioner
here
may
have
been
saying
as
well,
that
if
you
have
a
licensing
law
that
permits
the
revocation
of
the
license,
the
revocation
is
not
a
licensing
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
have
a
licensing
law
which
says
if
you
do
this
your
license
will
be
revoked.
does
that
remain
an
a
licensing
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
make
exception
for
licensing
laws
therefore
if
you
can't
evoke
a
license
under
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you
are
in
you
can
do
whatever
you
like,
you
think
that
is
what
congress
meant?
you
can
pass
upon
their
fitness
when
you
issue
the
license,
but
once
its
issued
they
can
do
whatever
they
like,
is
that
what
you
are
telling
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
revocation.
okay.
so
that
raises
the
question
what
does
it
make,
why
does
it
make
any
difference
if
the
revocation
provision
is
contained
in
the
narrow
licensing
law
or
if
there
is
a
general
state
law
which
says
all
licenses
that
are
issued
may
be
revoked
for
certain
reasons?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
should
just
--
arizona
should
just
amend
all
its
licensing
laws
to
require
what
they
now
require
when
the
license
is
issued,
and
to
say
in
each
specific
licensing
law,
that
it
can
be
revoked
for
the
same
--
on
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
that's
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
congress
never
expected
that
the
states
would
have
to
resort
to
such
massive
measures,
and
they
probably
wouldn't
have
if
--
if
the
law
had
been
uniformly
enforced
and
vigorously
enforced;
right?
you
--
you
didn't
--
didn't
have
any
notion
of
doing
this
sort
of
thing
in
1986,
did
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
maybe
congress
wasn't
worried
about
it
because
it
seemed
very
unlikely
that
anything
like
that
would
occur.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
--
do
you
make
it
mandatory?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
--
you
just
don't
get
the
safe
harbor.
isn't
that
the
only
consequence?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
this
lawsuit
challenge
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
under
the
old
law,
and
the
only
sanction
is
you
lose
the
safe
harbor,
if
that's
a
sanction.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
after
this
case
we
can
look
forward
to
the
cases,
one
by
one,
for
all
the
various
types
of
licenses?
those
would
be
as-applied
challenges
and
would
not
have
been
resolved
by
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
really
wasting
our
time
here,
aren't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
are
you
conceding
that
any
variation
from
the
federal
standards
for
--
for
criminal
and
civil
liability
is
automatically
precluded?
i
mean,
as
i
read
the
exception,
it's
an
exception
for
state
licensing
and
similar
laws.
and
it
doesn't
say,
"so
long
as
those
licensing
and
similar
laws
go
no
further
than
what
the
federal
government
has
done.
"
i
mean,
we
often
allow
states
to
impose
regulatory
requirements
that
go
beyond
the
regulatory
requirements
that
the
federal
government
has
imposed,
and
that
is
not
automatically
considered
to
be
preempted.
so
why
--
why
are
you
conceding
that
arizona
cannot
go
a
whit
beyond
what
the
federal
government
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
convicted
by
--
by
a
federal
government
that
hasn't
gone
after
many
convictions.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
whole
problem.
