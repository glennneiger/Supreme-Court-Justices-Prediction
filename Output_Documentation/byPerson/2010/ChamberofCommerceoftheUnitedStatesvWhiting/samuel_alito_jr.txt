justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
this
question
to
get
back
to
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
a
licensing
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
"licensing"
is
not
an
unknown
term.
states
and
municipalities
issue
all
sorts
of
licenses.
for
example,
i
think
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
every
business
has
to
have
a
general
business
license,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
if
the
district
of
columbia
were,
after
having
enacted
this
requirement
some
years
ago,
were
to
pass
a
new
ordinance
saying
and
"if
you
knowingly
hire
an
illegal
alien,
your
general
business
license
can
be
forfeited.
"
would
that
not
--
would
that
cease
to
be
a
licensing
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
doesn't
the
exception
for
licensing
mean
that
this
isn't
going
to
be
completely
uniform?
one
jurisdiction
may
take
the
position
that
a
restaurant
that
employs
illegal
aliens
may
lose
its
restaurant
license
--
its
license
to
operate.
another
one
may
take
a
different
position.
so
it's
not
going
to
be
the
same.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
there
--
isn't
there
a
difference
in
saying
that
it
may
not
be
used
for
any
purpose
other
than
for
enforcement
of
this
chapter
and
other
provisions
of
federal
law
on
one
hand;
and
on
the
other
hand
saying
it
may
not
be
used
for
any
purpose
other
than
in
a
federal
proceeding?
the
enforcement
--
the
i-9
certainly
could
be
used
in
a
federal
proceeding
by
the
employer.
would
that
then
--
would
that
be
used
for
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
law?
i
wouldn't
think
so.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
federal
law
and
the
state
law
do
seem
to
be
exactly
the
same
on
this
point,
but
i
have
--
i
don't
understand
how
these
two
provisions
fit
together
when
e-verify
is
used.
suppose
an
employer
--
the
first
thing
the
employer
does
is
receive
the
forms
from
the
employee,
from
the
i-9
process.
he
looks
at
the
forms.
well,
they
reasonably
seem
to
be
authentic.
so
that
employer
now
has
the
good
faith
defense
that's
provided
under
--
by
the
i-9
process,
under
both
federal
law
and
state
law.
but
under
both
federal
law
and
state
law,
the
employee
--
employer
either
must
or
may
also
use
the
e-verification
system.
the
employer
gets
back
a
notice
of
non-authorization.
but
what
--
and
that
creates,
supposedly,
a
rebuttable
presumption
under
both
systems
that
the
employee
is
not
authorized
to
work.
how
does
that
fit
together?
if
you
have
a
complete
defense
for
having
used
the
i-9
process
in
good
faith,
the
whole
e-verification
process
seems
to
be
irrelevant
under
both
federal
law
and
state
law.
i
don't
understand
how
they
fit
together.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
it's
on
page
184
to
185
of
the
appendix
petition,
isn't
it?
