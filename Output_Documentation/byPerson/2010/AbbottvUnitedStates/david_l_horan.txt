mr.
david
l.
horan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statutory
interpretation
question
here
is
what
laws
trigger
section
924(c)(1)(a)'s
except
clause.
mr.
gould
offers
an
interpretation
that
gives
meaning
and
effect
to
every
word
and
phrase
of
section
924(c)(1)(a)
and
follows
this
court's
recent
holdings
regarding
the
broad
scope
of
the
phrase
"any
other
provision
of
law".
the
government,
on
the
other
hand,
advocates
a
narrow
construction
that
is
not
supported
by
the
text
and
defends
it
primarily
on
the
basis
that
section
924(c)
supposedly
should
always
produce
the
most
severe
mandatory
minimum
sentence
for
every
defendant.
respectfully,
the
government's
interpretation
is
incorrect.
its
reading
gives
no
practical
effect
to
the
phrase
v.
beaty
just
last
year.
unlike
the
government's,
mr.
gould's
interpretation
is
true
to
the
text,
is
true
to
this
court's
holdings,
and
it's
true
to
congress's
evident
purpose
in
924(c)(1)(a),
and
in
particular
in
its
except
clause.
mr.
david
l.
horan
your
honor,
as
a
judicial
matter,
i
would
note
that
i
think
our
interpretations
are
not
that
far
apart.
mr.
david
l.
horan
they
are
not.
and
our
interpretation,
we
believe,
is
the
closest
to
the
actual
text.
our
interpretation
requires
reading
no
language
into
the
text.
it--
mr.
david
l.
horan
--your
honor,
respectfully,
i
believe
under
our
interpretation,
it
--
there
is
--
you
do
have
to
understand
something
to
be
in
there,
but
we
are
not
actually
reading
anything
into
the
text.
that
is
the
reason
--
to
be
sure,
the
words
"any
kind
of
conviction"
are
not
in
there.
however,
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
text,
without
adding
anything
to
it,
is
that
924(c)(1)(a)
requires
a
five-year
--
at
least
a
five-year
minimum
sentence,
in
addition
to
any
sentence
for
the
predicate
drug
trafficking
or
violent
crime,
except
to
the
extent
that
a
greater
minimum
sentence
is
provided
for
the
defendant
by
subsection
924(c)
or
by
any
other
provision
of
law.
mr.
david
l.
horan
yes.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
to
follow
on
that,
it
is
true
that
our
interpretation
--
we
think
that
the
plain
text
dictates
that
if
the
except
clause
is
triggered,
the
lesser
mandatory
minimum
sentence
under
924(c)(1)(a)
shall
not
be
imposed;
that
is--
mr.
david
l.
horan
--that
is
the
--
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
recognizing
that
limitation.
mr.
david
l.
horan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
horan
your
honor,
two
things--
mr.
david
l.
horan
--if
i
may,
and
i
think
it
will
help
in
answering
your
question,
justice
sotomayor,
that
is
correct.
the
only
thing
i
would
say,
the
thing
i
would
additionally
say,
though,
is
that
there
is
--
in
the
sentencing
guidelines,
which
must
be
applied
even
now,
as
--
to
provide
a
recommended
range,
there
would
in
each
of
these
instances
be
a
firearm
enhancement
that
enhances
the
underlying
predicate
offenses'
sentence
that
the
defendant
would
be
facing
and
how
the
district
court
would
work.
so
i
believe--
mr.
david
l.
horan
--that
is
no
longer
mandatory.
that
is
correct.
and
then
with
regard
to
your
question,
justice--
mr.
david
l.
horan
--yes,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
there
would
no
longer
be
a
mandatory
sentence
for
--
mandatory
additional
punishment
for
the
firearm
possession.
mr.
david
l.
horan
justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
correct
to
an
extent.
the
main
exception
to
that,
and
i
think
it's
a
significant
one,
is
that
the
except
clause
would
most
often
be
triggered
in
the
majority
of
cases
by
the
predicate
drug
trafficking
or
violent
crime
that
carries
with
it
a
greater
mandatory
minimum
sentence
that
is,
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
the
same
offense
as
924(c).
so,
in
fact,
there
is
a
significant
constraint
on
the
prosecution,
that
it
cannot
bring
a
separate
prosecution
for
924(c)
and
its
predicate
drug
or
trafficking
--
drug
trafficking
or
violent
crime.
so
it's
a
significant
limitation
on
this--
mr.
david
l.
horan
--okay.
and
justice
sotomayor,
to
return
to
your
question,
--
if
i
could
answer
it
in
two
parts.
first
--
and
i
didn't
mean
to
overstate,
if
i
did
--
we
are
not
reading
additional
language
into
it.
our
reading
is
contained
within
the
context
and
the
actual
text
that
--
that
is
confined
to
section
924(c).
mr.
david
l.
horan
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
david
l.
horan
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
it
is
the
words
"is
otherwise
provided"
and
the
context
in
which
any
textual
reading--
mr.
david
l.
horan
--your
honor,
it
is
--
first
of
all,
the
statute
begins
by
directing
the
defendant
--
i
mean,
directing
the
district
court
to
any
person.
so
they
are
focusing
on
the
defendant.
that
is
the
offense
defining
provision,
to
be
sure,
of
the
sentence.
but
throughout
the
text,
it
also
directs
the
district
court
to
take
account
of
minimum
sentences
that
are
provided
for
other
crimes;
for
instance,
primarily
the
predicate--
mr.
david
l.
horan
--your
honor,
because
that
--
because
the
statute
as
a
whole
is
essentially
instructions
to
the
district
court
on
how
to
sentence
the
defendant,
if
at
all,
for
the
924(c)(1)(a)
offense.
it
directs
them
to,
after
considering
the
person
in
front
of
them,
to
impose
a
sentence
of
five
years
or
less,
in
addition
to
the
predicate
--
any
penalty
for
the
--
the
predicate
drug
trafficking
or
violent
crime,
except
to
the
extent
that
a
greater
minimum
sentence
is
otherwise
provided.
the
natural
reading
of
that
is
--
must
be
that
it
is
a
--
a
greater
minimum
sentence
is
provided
for
that
defendant;
that
is,
before
the
particular
district
court
with
the
particular
offenses
that
he
has
before
him
at
sentencing.
mr.
david
l.
horan
many
of
them
do,
your
honor.
in
fact,
those
that
carry
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
largely
carry
--
all
carry,
in
fact,
ten
years.
there
are
some
--
there
are
some
both
predicate
drug
trafficking
offenses
and
predicate
violent
crimes
that
carry
either
no
minimum
at
all
or
a
mandatory
minimum
of
five
years
or
less,
and
so
would
not
trigger
the
except
clause.
mr.
david
l.
horan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
horan
yes.
mr.
david
l.
horan
in
answering
your
question,
justice
breyer,
and
in
answering
justice
scalia's
question,
my
assumption
was
that
there
were,
in
fact,
mandatory
minimums
such
that
this
would
play
out
with
one
being
greater
than
the
other.
mr.
david
l.
horan
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
l.
horan
your
honor,
there
will
be
circumstances
in
which
the
prosecutor
for
the
government,
based
on
how
it
makes
its
charging
decisions,
can
affect
the
floor
that's
created
by
the
minimum
sentence.
it's
a
different
situation
than
deal,
which
is
actually
determinant
sentences.
it's
not
actually
a
circumstance
where
the
government
can
determine
the
punishment
itself.
that
would
still
be
to
the
district
court.
but
we
maintain
that
this
is
the
most
natural
reading.
and
in
fact,
for
instance,
when
this
concern
came
up
in
deal,
that
was
confirmed
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
plain
text.
the
government
would
actually
turn
that
analysis
on
its
head
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
david
l.
horan
no,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
david
l.
horan
--no,
i'm
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor,
in
part
because
the
except
clause
is
--
there
aren't
that
many
instances
of
the
except
clause
having
been
actually
applied.
mr.
david
l.
horan
there
may
be
--
justice
scalia,
there
may
be
some
incentive
do
so,
subject
to
other
constraints,
including
the
--
the
usual
practice
of
charging,
for
instance,
most
offenses
as
they
come
under
the
transaction
in
the
same
indictment.
there
are
--
will
be
counterincentives,
to
be
sure.
your
honor,
for
the
--
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
our
interpretation
does
not
involve,
we
think,
adding
anything
into
the
text
that
others
must,
we
think
it
establishes
--
it
advances
an
evident
purpose
that
congress
had
in
this,
which
was
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
who
is
convicted
under
924(c)(1)(a)
receives
some
sufficient
minimum
punishment.
after
1998,
the
1998
amendments,
section
924(c)(1)(a)
was
trafficking,
in
essence,
in
minimum
sentences.
and
that's
what
this
is
about.
so
this
way,
a
defendant
will
receive
a
sufficient
minimum
sentence
by
way
of
924(c)
--
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
abbott
will
be
represented
by
mr.
ryan
at
this
time.
mr.
david
l.
horan
thank
you.
