justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
the
text
of
this
is
so
clear,
how
is
it
that
mr.
gould
and
mr.
abbott
proposed
different
interpretations
of
this
provision?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
they
are
not
the
same,
are
they?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
--
there
is
a
missing
prepositional
phrase
in
this
--
in
the
provision
that
we
are
looking
at.
it
says,
"except
to
the
extent
that
a
greater
minimum
sentence
is
otherwise
provided.
"
for
what?
and
all
of
you
have
to
--
are
filling
in
the
prepositional
phrase.
for
an
offense
of
conviction,
for
--
for
an
offense
that's
part
of
the
underlying
transaction,
for
a
violation
of
this
particular
provision
or
one
that's
very
similar
to
it.
there
is
just
no
way
of
getting
around
the
fact
that
something
has
to
be
read
in
there.
something
is
implied;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
would
we
look
to
find
the
definition
of
a
criminal
transaction
for
these
purposes?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
there
were
several
924(c)
offenses
committed
during
a
rather
brief
period
of
time?
what
if
on
the
same
afternoon
an
individual
engaged
in
a
number
of
drug
trafficking
offenses
and
during
each
of
those
used
or
carried
a
firearm?
would
they
--
would
they
be
part
of
the
same
criminal
transaction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
say
different
transactions,
but
i'm
looking
for
the
definition
of
a
criminal
transaction.
the
criminal
law
has
labored
with
this
for
a
long
time.
it's
not
a
self-defining
concept,
is
it,
a
criminal
transaction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
it
gives
broader
effect.
it
gives
broader
effect
to
the
"except"
clause,
but
the
government's
argument
gives
effect
to
the
"except"
clause,
doesn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--3359(c)
which
was
enacted
at
the
same
time
as
the
924(c).
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
whenever
congress
uses
a
phrase
like
that,
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law.
"
does
that
mean
that
congress
must
think
that
there
is
some
provision
of
law
that
falls
within
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
doesn't
congress
commonly
do
that
to
make
sure
that
something
covers
any
existing
statute
there
might
be
that
would
fall
within
that,
without
necessarily
saying:
well,
there
are
two
of
them
--
if
there
are
two,
maybe
there
are
three?
going
through
the
entire
code
to
find
out
how
many
there
might
be,
or
if
there
is
any?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
is
not
consistent
with
your
main
argument
about
the
except
clause,
is
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
your
argument
is
the
except
clause
has
to
have
some
pretty
substantial
effect,
or
otherwise,
the
"any
other
provision
of
law"
part
of
it
--
otherwise,
they
wouldn't
have
put
it
in.
