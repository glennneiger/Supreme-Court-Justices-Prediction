mr.
james
e.
ryan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
spend
some
time
on
the
second
question
in
our
petition,
regarding
whether
other
firearms
offenses
are
included
within
the
scope
of
the
except
clause.
but
before
i
do,
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points
about
the
first
question,
which
is
common
to
our
case
and
to
mr.
gould's.
justice
sotomayor
asked:
why
isn't
the
government's
reading
the
most
natural?
and
the
answer
is
pretty
simple.
the
government's
reading
leaves
one
half
of
the
effect
clause
with
absolutely
no
practical
effect.
the
government
has,
in
its
current
interpretation,
suggested
that
the
except
clause
applies
to
one
provision
of
law
outside
of
924(c).
that
is
3559(c).
and
yet
with
respect
to
that
provision,
the
except
clause
does
absolutely
no
work,
both
for
practical
reasons
and
because
of
the
way
3559(c)
is
written.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
it's
not
clear
from
the
government's
argument,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument,
the
sentence
that
--
the
only
sentence
that
would
count
outside
of
924(c)
would
be
a
sentence
specifically
for
a
924(c)(1)(a)
offense--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
--exactly
right.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
that's
exactly
right,
justice
sotomayor.
and--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
--okay.
that
point
actually
demonstrates
why
the
government's
justification
for
this
limitation
doesn't
hold
up.
as
the
government
argues
at
one
point,
the
reason
to
read
924(c)(1)(a)
crimes
is
because
the
924(c)(1)(a)
offenses.
yet
that
is
not
the
case.
as
this
court
indicated
in
o'brien,
924(c)(1)(b)
is
a
separate
offense.
well,
if
924(c)(1)(b)
can
trigger
the
924(c)(1)(a),
the
government's
argument
about
excluding
other
offenses
that
might
be
separate
from
924(c)(1)(a)
no
longer
holds
up.
the
other
difficulty
with
the
government's
reading,
to
go
back
to
the
practical
point,
is
that
if
you
apply
it
just
to
3559(c),
it
can
have
no
effect
because
as
a
practical
matter
no
one
can
serve
a
term
of
years
after
successfully
completing
a
life
sentence,
which
is
what's
required
under
3559(c);
and
3559(c)
itself
has
a
provision
that,
the
924(c)
is
the
third
strike
for
purposes
of
3559(c).
that
in
turn
just
leaves
future
applications,
and
there
the
government's
scenario
under
which
the
language
that
currently
has
no
effect
might
have
some
effect
is
nothing
short
of
far-fetched.
it
would
require
congress
to
amend
the
sentence
of
924(c)(1)(a)
outside
of
924(c)(1)(a)
and
not
indicate
how
those
two
penalties
should
interact.
now,
if
i
could
turn
to
the
questions
about
the
transactional
limitation
which
we
suggest.
the
point
of
suggesting
that
the
mr.
gould's
counsel.
we
think
that
it's
the
more
natural
reading
of
the
statute
in
part
because
of
concerns
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
united
states
v.
deal,
namely
that
the
statute
is
not
designed
and
should
not
be
read
to
give
prosecutors
unreviewable
discretion
as
to
when
the
minimum
sentence
in
924(c)
ought
to
be
applied
or
not.
it
also
would
preclude
the
equally
odd
situation
of
a
defendant
being
able
to
benefit
from
the
"except"
clause
in
a
multi-count
indictment
when
the
defendant
has
--
faces
a
higher
mandatory
minimum
sentence
for
a
completely
unrelated
--
unrelated
charge.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
you
could
look
into
924(c)
itself.
our
view
is
that
it
would
be
no
different
than
the
transaction
that
would
give
rise
to
the
924(c)
charge
itself,
and
so
for
that
reason
would
necessarily
include
the
predicate
offense
or
another
firearms
offense.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
no.
just
as
different
--
different
transactions
can
lead
to
multiple
924(c)
charges,
which
is
what
happened
in
deal,
that
could
also
occur
here.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
no,
it's
not,
but
--
your
honor,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
would
be
any
more
difficult
to
determine
the
transaction
than
to
look
at
what
would
constitute
the
924(c)
offense.
it
would
be
the
same
set
of
operative
facts
that
could
lead
to
a
924(c)
charge
which
would
count
as
the
transaction.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
that
is
mr.
gould's
position.
our
position
is
limited
to
the
same
transaction.
our
alternative
position,
which
i
would
like
to
turn
now--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
--well,
the
way
it
would
have
to
work
is
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
previous
conviction.
now,
if
i
could
turn
to
the
firearms
argument.
our
argument
here
is
straightforward--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
--i
misspoke.
justice
scalia,
you
are
exactly
right.
it
would
include
uncharged.
it
would
--
it
would
prohibit
prosecutors
from
being
able
to
use
charging
instruments
to
determine
whether
924(c)
would
apply.
i
was
thinking
of
a
particular
example,
but
in
the
general
case
you
are
right.
i
apologize
for
that
misstatement.
now,
if
i
could
just
spend
a
little
bit
of
time
on
our
second
question.
our
argument
here
is
fairly
straightforward
and
fairly
modest.
and
it
relies
on
the
fact
that
924(c)
is
essentially
a
firearms
offense,
and
the
punishment
provided
in
the
different
paragraphs
in
924(c)
are
primarily
about
firearms.
and
so,
in
looking
to
determine
the
meaning
of
924(c)
that
punish
firearms
offenses.
now,
to
be
sure,
this
particular
limitation
is
not
commanded
by
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
rests,
like
the
government's
argument,
on
context
and
purpose.
but
the
difference
is
that
this
argument
still
gives
some
effect
to
the
"except"
clause.
it
would
apply,
as
here,
to
other
firearms
offenses
outside
of
924(c)
like
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
it
gives
no--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
--two
points,
justice
alito.
first,
the
government's
reading
has
no
practical
effect.
it
leaves
the
"except"
cause
with
no
practical
effect.
you
could
take
the
3559(c).
as
for
the
enactment
of
3559(c),
the
government's
argument
is
actually
different.
the
government
argues
that
when
3559(c)
was
amended
to
include
possession--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
--it
was
at
that
point
that
the
except
clause
also
entered
into
924(c).
the
difficulty
with
that
argument,
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
is
that
3559(c)
was
already
linked
with
924(c)
insofar
as
both
addressed
use.
and
because
3559(c)
and
924(c)
were
already
linked,
and
the
3559(c)
indicated
that
if
the
924(c)
offense
is
your
third
strike,
you
get
the
life
sentence,
that's
it,
well,
the
fact
that
congress
then
amended
3559(c)
to
make
another
connection
with
924(c)
can't
possibly
explain
why
there
is
a
sudden
need
for
the
"except"
clause.
but
the
question
is
an
--
is
an
important
one
because
it
goes
to
the
fact
that
the
government
has
offered
three
different
interpretations
of
the
language
in
this
case.
the
first
--
one
of
the
first
was
in
whitley,
where
it
suggested
924(c)
provided
that
they
impose
a
consecutive
sentence.
that
argument
was
rejected
for
the
idea
that,
instead,
924's
3559(c);
and
it
has
come
up
with
a
new
theory
as
to
why
the
"except"
clause
exists
in
the
first
place.
but
that
theory
doesn't
hold
up,
and
the
government's
shifting
interpretations,
if
nothing
else,
suggests
that
the
government
has
not
hit
upon
the
most
natural
reading.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
we
think
our
first
argument
is
the
most
natural
and
the
clearest,
but
i
take
your
point;
and
the
only
response
i
would
make
is,
if
shifting
interpretations
or
different
interpretations
suggest
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
language
is
ambiguous
and
grievously
so,
under
the
rule
of
lenity,
we
ought
to
prevail.
so
i'm
perfectly
comfortable
with
that
conclusion.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
that--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
i
would
like
to
make
two
points
on
rebuttal.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
the
general
purpose
of
924(c).
but
as
this
court
has
indicated,
the
best
indication
of
a
statute's
purpose
is
the
statute's
language,
and
although
the
government
argues
that
the
sole
purpose
of
924(c)
was
to
enhance
punishment
for
defendants,
the
except
clause
belies
that
simplistic
assertion
of
the
purpose.
the
except
clause
actually
mediates
the
punishment
that
is
provided
in
924(c).
the
government's
reading,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
wants
to
rely
on
purpose
in
order
to
give
no
effect
to
the
except
clause.
the
idea
that
3559(c)
is
an
instruction
to
busy
district
court
judges,
even
putting
aside
the
impossibility
of
serving
an
additional
sentence
after
completing
a
life
sentence,
doesn't
hold
up,
because
the
government
never
disputes
the
fact
that
3559(c)
begins
with
the
statement,
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law.
"
so
the
busy
district
court
never
needs
to
turn
to
the
except
clause
in
924(c)(1)(a)
to
know
that
you
impose
a
life
sentence
when
the
third
strike
is
a
924(c).
mr.
james
e.
ryan
possibly,
yes.
and
here,
the
other
provision
of
law
would
be
924(c),
and--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
--yes,
justice
alito,
and
that
is
consistent
with
my
point,
is
that--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
--well,
yes,
it
is,
because
the
except
clause
would
also
apply
to
any
other
provision
of
law.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
oh,
i
apologize.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
the
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law.
"
in
the
context
of
924(c),
would
not
have
any
effect
if
the
except
clause
was
considered
first.
but
3559(c)
applies
to
many
other
triggering
offenses
and
so
with
regards
to
those,
and
the
government
has
not
suggested
that
3559(c)
has
--
has
no
effect.
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
regardless
of
one's
view
about
mandatory
minimum
sentences
as
a
matter
of
policy,
no
one
doubts
that
congress
has
the
authority,
if
it
chooses
to
exercise
it,
to
stack
one
mandatory
minimum
sentence
on
top
of
another.
but
as
this
court's
cases
make
clear,
congress,
under
the
rule
of
lenity,
needs
to
make
that
choice
clear.
and
if
nothing
else,
the
government's
shifting
views
indicate
that
congress
has
not
exercised
that
choice
clearly
in
this
case.
