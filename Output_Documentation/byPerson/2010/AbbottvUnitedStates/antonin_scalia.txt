justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
suppose
the
prosecution
can
alter
the
consequence
based
on
what
it
chooses
to
bring
in
a
single
prosecution.
i
mean,
if
it
has
a
--
other
enhancements,
it
should
bring
a
separate
prosecution
for
that.
so
long
as
it
brings
it
in
one
suit,
you
say,
in
one
prosecution,
you
get
the
break.
but
if
--
if
the
other
enhancement
is
brought
--
has
been
brought
in
a
separate
prosecution,
you
don't
get
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
yes,
i
understand
what
you
are
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
let's
suppose
somebody
commits
a
rape
and
a
maiming
in
the
same
criminal
act.
you
are
saying
that
the
prosecution
--
and
let's
assume
it's
his
third.
it's
his
third
violent
crime.
so
he
would
get
the
enhancement
as
being,
you
know,
a
three-time
violent
crime
loser.
you
are
saying
he
could
get
that
enhancement
and
the
enhancement
under
this
--
under
this
gun
--
he
had
a
gun
at
the
same
time.
he
can
get
it
if
the
prosecution
charges
rape
in
one
prosecution,
for
which
he
will
get
the
three-time
loser
enhancement,
and
then
in
a
separate
prosecution,
it
charges
maiming
and
the
use
of
a
firearm.
then
he
gets
both
enhancements,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he's
disagreeing
with
you.
he
--
your
theory
--
you
are
not
reading
a
crime
to
mean
an
affair
in
the
world.
you
are
reading
it
to
mean
a
particular
prosecution
for
a
particular
violation
of
a
statute.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
read
it
that
way.
if
he
wants
to
read
it
as
an
affair
in
the
world,
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
has
never
been
any
incentive
to
do
so,
until
we
accept
your
interpretation.
then
there
will
be
means
to
do
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
before
you
go
on.
your
last
remark,
it
has
to
be
a
previous
conviction.
so
why
doesn't
that
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
the
prosecutor
whether
to
bring
that
conviction,
that
other
case,
prior
or
subsequent?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
would
include
(b).
(b)
is
part
of
the
same
subsection,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
know,
i
think
what
the
chief
justice
says
is
very
obvious
when
you
are
just
talking
about
c(1)(a),
but
it
isn't
obvious
to
me
that
if
--
if
the
firearm
is
discharged
and
in
addition
it's
a
machine
gun
or
destructive
device,
that
you'd
only
get
the
30
rather
than
the
30
plus
10.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
obvious
to
me.
and
the
"except"
clause
would
--
would
handle
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
930(c)?
can
you
tell
me
where
it
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--wait,
but
it
--
but
it
does
--
it
does
subject
them
to
less,
at
least
with
respect
to
those
--
those
enhancements
set
forth
within
the
subsection
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
only
thing
that
that
additional
language
which
says,
"otherwise
provided
by
this
subsection
or
by
any
other
provision
of
law.
"
--why
didn't
they
just
mention
3559(c)?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
only
thing
it
covers,
that
tiny
little
thing
which
has
no
effect
at
all,
except
for
the
benefit
of
the
busy
district
judges,
you
say.
i
--
i
find
that
quite
implausible.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
witness
at
a
hearing?
at
a
hearing?
and
you
really
think
that
the
rest
of
the
congress
knew
about
that
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
i
mean,
the
guidelines
can't
be,
as
justice
breyer
said,
just
like
a
mandatory.
they
can't
be,
can
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
advisory.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
for
other
provisions
anywhere
in
the
code?
i
mean,
regardless
of
whether
those
provisions
are
being
prosecuted
in
this
particular
indictment?
i
mean,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
are
saying
that
the
other
side
has
to
say:
well,
it's
only
those
that
are
in
this
particular
criminal
transaction,
or
only
those
in
the
particular
indictment.
do
you
escape
that
necessity?
