chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
09-479,
abbott
v.
united
states
and
the
consolidated
case,
7073,
gould
v.
united
states.
mr.
horan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief

mr.

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
mcleese.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
not
--
i
can't
imagine
a
single
district
judge
getting
that
wrong.
to
think
that,
oh,
my
gosh,
here
it
says
10
years
if
you
discharge
the
firearms
and
here
it
says
5
years
if
you
have
one,
which
one
do
i
use
in
a
case
when
it's
discharged?
you
don't
need
this
provision.
your
argument
can't
be
that
this
language
is
to
make
sure
the
district
judge
knows
in
that
case
to
use
the
10-year
rather
than
the
5-year?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
things
are
obvious
to
different
people.
i
would
have
thought
it
would
be
odd
to
say
when
there
are
increased
minimums
that
the
highest
minimum
applicable
isn't
the
one
that
applies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
main
--
the
meat
of
your
argument
focuses
on
3559(c),
right?
there
is
this
significant
provision
out
there
that
does
provide
a
greater
mandatory
minimum.
and
i
just
don't
see
as
a
practical
matter
why
people
would
worry
about
that.
under
3559(c),
you
get
life.
and
you
are
saying,
well,
they
put
in
the
5
years
at
the
end
of
a
life
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
exactly.
yes,
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
well,
just
so
i
make
sure
i
understand,
the
basic
point
you
are
making
is
that
there
are
some
things
under
your
reading
that
this
deals
with.
one
is
the
internal
point,
and
we
can
disagree
as
to
whether
that
is
necessary
or
not,
and
the
other
is
3559(c),
where
it
seems
to
me
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
you
are
in
there
for
life
or
life
and
the
additional
5
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
a
difficult
--
you
are
saying
because
congress
wanted
to
get
tough
on
the
people
that
use
firearms
in
this
provision,
every
ambiguous
clause
should
be
read
in
a
way
that
makes
it
tougher
on
the
criminal
defendant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
respect
to
3559(c)
they
were
in
fact
being
more
lenient,
not
stricter,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
said
earlier
the
purpose
of
this,
what
it
does,
is
it
makes
sure
that
you
don't
add
five
extra
years
on
the
people
who
are
sentenced
to
life.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
is
just
saying
when
you
get
life,
or
you
get
5,
just
serve
life,
don't
serve
the
extra
5.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
reason
they
put
this
in
was
to
ensure
that
people
who
got
life
would
not
get
life
plus
five
years?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
should
pick
any
other
violent
or
drug
trafficking
offense
that
already
provides
a
higher
minimum.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
seems
to
me
the
perfectly
natural
reading
to
say:
look,
we
are
providing
some
minimum
sentences
when
this
happens,
when
this
is
the
violent
crime
and
you
use
a
gun,
but
if
you
have
already
got
a
higher
sentence
for
the
violent
crime,
then
this
doesn't
apply.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
justice
breyer
has
pointed
out,
he
can
take
that
into
account
in
figuring
out
what
sentence
he
would
want
to
impose
beyond
the
greater
minimum.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
mcleese.
mr.
ryan,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
