justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
right.
i
think
that
this
may
well
apply
to
the
crime
that
is
being
--
that
is
being
prosecuted
where
the
crime
is
defined
as
a
real
offense
in
the
world,
with
the
limitations
put
on
that
term
by
the
guidelines.
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
natural
reading,
in
which
case
you
would
look
to
the
conduct
of
the
person.
and
if
the
conduct
of
the
person
is
such
that
it
calls
for
a
mandatory
minimum
of
a
certain
kind,
there
we
are.
if
that
exceeds
this
amount,
there
we
are.
you
can't
apply
it.
and
if
it
doesn't,
you
do
apply
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
looked
into
that?
i
mean,
that
was
my
reading
of
it
as
--
in
the
most
natural
way.
the
word
"crime"
is
ambiguous.
sometimes
it
means
words
in
a
statute.
sometimes
it
means
an
affair
in
the
world.
and
i
thought
this
one
probably
meant
the
affair
in
the
world.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
then
this
gives
tremendous
power
to
the
prosecutor
to
decide
what
the
sentence
will
be
in
terms
of
how
he
manipulates
the
charge.
and
i
thought
that
probably
this,
read
with
the
guidelines,
is
designed
not
to
--
not
to
permit
that.
it's
to
minimize
the
discretion,
not
to
maximize.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
it
makes
any
difference.
i
mean,
has
there
ever
been
such
a
case,
where
the
prosecutor
worked
this
in
such
a
way
that
he
would
produce
this?
are
you
aware
if
any
such
case
ever
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
are
two
possible
readings
now
of
the
"except"
clause
where
it
says
--
the
words
are
the
subsection
doesn't
apply
where
a
mandatory
--
where
any
other
provision
of
law
sets
forth
a
higher
mandatory.
now,
one
possible
reading,
which
is
yours,
is
what
this
means
is
that,
judge,
where
you
are
operating
under
that
provision
you
just
mentioned,
and
the
guy
has
committed
two
serious
924(c)
things,
and
so
he
is
entitled
to
life
--
this
is
just
what
the
chief
justice
said
--
this
is
done
to
remind
the
judge
don't
give
him
life
plus
25
years,
because
it
would
be
25
years
under
this
statute,
not
5.
that
is
one
possibly
reading.
the
other
possible
reading
is,
judge,
where,
in
fact,
you
have
the
underlying
drug
offense,
that's
going
to
get
you
up
into
the
30s
in
the
guidelines,
it's
going
to
be
probably
10,
5
years,
or
whatever
it
is.
you
have
a
pretty
high
drug
offense
already.
and
now
we
give
him
5
extra
years,
say,
for
having
a
gun
under
this,
unless
he's
already
gotten,
say,
a
mandatory
minimum
of
7
years.
and
if
he's
already
gotten
the
mandatory
minimum
of
7
years,
here's
what's
happened:
judge,
turn
to
the
guidelines
and
the
guidelines
will
tell
you
to
add
3
or
4
extra
years.
so
in
one
--
those
are
the
two
possible
readings.
now,
the
first
reading
to
me
makes
very
little
sense.
the
second
reading
to
me
says,
yeah,
this
is
serving
a
purpose.
it's
once
you
are
sure
this
guy
has
to
go
to
jail
for
5,
6,
7,
maybe
10
or
20
years
for
sure,
extra
amounts
are
controlled
by
the
guidelines,
which
is
administered
by
a
judge.
now,
if
you
just
came
across
that
for
the
first
time,
which
would
you
think
was
most
probable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
--
when
did
congress
pass
the
statute
that
they
amended
in
1998?
the
one
you
are
saying
--
i
mean,
it's
a
good
point,
you
have
a
point,
that
this
would
make
it
more
lenient,
the
interpretation.
but
the
"it"
was
passed
when?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
way
before
the
guidelines.
so
what
they
are
trying
to
do
now,
in
1998,
is
they
are
trying
to
--
see,
in
1998
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
take
some
of
these
old
provisions
and
reconcile
them
with
this
new
system
that
has
come
along.
so
i
agree
you
have
a
point
there.
but
it
--
it
does
make
a
certain
amount
of
sense,
because
what
it
is
saying
is,
in
these
cases
where
you
have
a
wappo
mandatory
minimum
anyway,
so
you
are
sure
he
has
got
it,
now
the
additional
amount
will
be
controlled
by
the
guidelines,
which
are
subject
to
not
much
discretion.
they
are
pretty
close
to
mandatory
minimums,
but
there
is
a
little
wiggle
room.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
strongly.
the
--
what
is
it
an
example?
you're
saying
this
thing
also
serves
the
purpose
that
perhaps
someday
congress
will
pass
a
new
statute,
a
totally
different
one,
and
a
busy
district
judge
might
think
that
he
should
add
the
5
or
25
years
from
this
provision
on
to
whatever
sentence
this
hypothetical
new
statute
provides,
but
this
will
tell
him
not
to
do
so.
did
you
have
anything
in
mind?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
in
those
other
sentences
there
are
other
thing
in
the
code,
and
the
odd
thing
about
this
one
is
there
no
other
thing
in
the
code
except
the
one
we
have
been
discussing.
and
so
i
just
wondered
if
there
--
was
there
at
the
time
anybody
thinking
of
adding
some
new
thing,
that
this
might
have
been
applicable
to?
or
have
you
come
across
anything?
i
take
it
your
answer
is
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
it's
a
shift
over
to
the
sentencing
guidelines
which
say
a
person
like
this
one
will
receive
an
extra
three
or
four
or
five
years
depending
on
the
circumstances.
will
receive
it,
just
like
a
mandatory.
unless,
of
course,
it
is
an
unusual
case.
that's
what
it's
a
shift
to.
am
i
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
did.
