so
that
means
there
would
be
no
punishment,
added
punishment,
at
all
for
the
possession
of
the
gun;
that
is,
you
have
the
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
no
gun
involved,
and
you
get
ten
years
mandatory
minimum
for
that.
that
automatically
would
wipe
out
any
add-on
for
the
gun,
under
your
reading.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
i
think
you
weren't
finished
answering
my
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
is
not
mandatory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are
saying
that
the
gun
possession
could
be
accounted
for
by
the
judge
as
a
matter
of
discretion
using
guidelines,
but
there
is
no
mandatory
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
don't
most
crimes
of
violence
and
drug
trafficking
carry
more
than
a
five-year
sentence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ryan,
i
thought
that
you
had
three
positions
and
now
you
are
talking
about
the
second
one,
which
is
any
greater
minimum
sentence
arising
from
the
same
criminal
episode.
but
i
thought
your
first
position
was
any
greater
minimum
sentence
applicable
to
the
defendant
at
sentencing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
have
offered
three
different
readings,
so
one
can't
say
that
this
statutory
text
has
a
clear
meaning,
which
i
think
is
your
first
argument
--
that
it
has
a
clear
meaning.
and
yet,
we
have
mr.
gould's
reading
and
then
the
two
readings
that
you
have
offered
us,
same
episode
and
same
gun.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
answer
mr.
ryan's
argument
that
you
can
read
it
this
way,
you
can
read
it
that
way;
therefore,
he
wins
under
the
rule
of
lenity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
federal
criminal
statute,
section
924(c)
of
title
18,
makes
it
a
discrete
offense
to
use,
carry
or
possess
a
deadly
weapon
in
connection
with
any
crime
of
violence
or
drug
trafficking
crime.
the
statute
imposes
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
of
five
years
to
run
consecutively
to
any
other
term
of
imprisonment
imposed
on
the
offender.
in
1998,
congress
reformulated
924(c)
in
the
name,
to
enlarge
its
scope
and
heighten
penalties
for
violation
of
the
provi
--
provision.
spotting
the
question
we
decide
today,
congress
also
added
a
preparatory
except
clause.
the
clause
states
that
the
five-year
minimum
sentence
shall
be
imposed
except
to
the
extent
that
a
greater
minimum
sentence
is
otherwise
provided
by
924(c)
itself
or
by
any
other
provision
of
law.
in
unrelated
cases,
petitioners
kevin
abbott
and
carlos
rashad
gould,
each
received
a
five-year
sentence
for
violating
924(c)
by
possessing
a
firearm
in
connection
with
the
drug
trafficking
crime.
abbott's
five-year
sentence
was
imposed
on
top
of
a
15
year
mandatory
sentence
for
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm.
gould's
five-year
term
was
added
to
a
ten-year
mandatory
sentence
for
his
drug
trafficking
crime.
abbott
and
gould
contend
that
there
are
heavier
sentences
imposed
for
counts
of
conviction
other
than
924(c),
each
of
them
greater
than
five
years,
triggered
the
“except”
clause.
the
clause
as
they
read
it,
exempts
them
from
serving
the
additional
five-year
term
specified
for
violating
924(c)
by
possessing
a
firearm
in
connection
with
the
drug
trafficking
crime.
the
courts
below,
at
the
second
--
the
u.s.
courts
of
appeals
for
the
third
and
fifth
circuits,
rejected
abbott's
and
gould's
interpretations.
the
“except”
clause,
those
courts
noted,
refers
to
a
greater
minimum
sentence
otherwise
provided.
“otherwise
provided
for
what?”
the
courts
asked.
they
answered,
“a
conduct
violating
924(c)
that
is,
possessing
a
firearm
in
connection
with
a
violent
or
drug
trafficking
crime.”
we
affirm
the
judgments
of
the
circuit
courts.
the
“except”
clause
we
hold,
applies
only
when
another
provision
whether
contained
within
or
placed
outside
924(c)
imposes
a
higher
mandatory
minimum
penalty
for
conduct
violating
924(c).
as
an
illustration,
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence
for
a
924(c)
offense
is
five
years
but
if
the
firearm
is
brandished,
the
minimum
rises
to
seven
and
if
the
firearm
is
discharged,
to
ten
years.
a
defendant
who
possess,
brandished
and
discharged
a
firearm
in
violation
of
924(c),
would
thus
face
a
mandatory
of
minimum
term
of
ten
years,
the
penalty
for
firing
a
weapon.
but
there
is
no
stacking
five
years
and
seven
on
that
added
to
10.
and
dispositive
here,
the
defendant
is
not
spared
from
serving
a
discrete
924(c)
sentence
by
virtue
of
receiving
a
higher
mandatory
minimum
on
a
different
count
of
conviction
in
abbott's
case,
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm
and
in
gould's,
drug
trafficking.
rather
a
924(c)
violator
is
subject
to
the
highest
mandatory
minimum
specified
for
the
conduct
offending
924(c)
unless
another
provision
of
law
addressed
to
the
conduct
prescribed
by
924(c),
imposes
an
even
greater
mandatory
minimum.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
