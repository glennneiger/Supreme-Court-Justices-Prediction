mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
district
court
judge
in--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
don't
think
there
needs
to
be
an
explicit
reference.
i
think
that
the
"except
clause
is
triggered
by
an
offense
which
has
a
greater
mandatory
minimum
and
which
has
the
same
elements
as
and
is
the
same
offense
as
a
section
924(c)
offense.
"
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
he
is
incorrect.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
first,
with
respect
to
the
internal
structure
of
924(c),
924(c)
as
it
was
amended
in
1998
is
a
somewhat
complex
statute.
it
has
a
mix
of
sentencing
enhancements
and
elements
which
create
aggravated
versions
of
the
offense;
but
it
is
all
a
single
offense
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
for
purposes
of
what
punishment
to
impose.
and
therefore,
the
924(c)
menu
items,
they
are
all
a
single
offense,
and
you
impose
a
single
mandatory
minimum
sentence
that
is
the
greatest
of
those
which
are
applicable.
now,
with
respect
to
930(c)--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--he
gets
20
years.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
because
the
924(c)
offense.
in
that
instance
there
are
two.
one
of
them
provides
for
a
7-year
mandatory
minimum,
one
provides
a
20-year
mandatory
minimum.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
he
gets
30.
the
924(c)
to
tell
the
district
court
judge,
very
helpfully
in
light
of
the
complexity
of
the
provision:
you
impose
one
mandatory
minimum
sentence
for
each
924(c)
violation,
whether
aggravated
or
less
aggravated--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--that
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
applies
in
support
of
our
position,
because
everyone
agrees
that
the
primary
function,
the
first
half
of
the
"except"
clause,
does
exactly
that.
that's
all
it
does.
it
does
nothing
else.
to
the
extent
the
"except"
clause
says
"except
to
the
extent
a
greater
minimum
sentence
is
provided
by
this
subsection.
"
the
only
function--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--yes.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
quite
so.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
correct.
and
it's
important
to
realize--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
agree
with
that,
but
it's
important
to
realize
that
another
issue
that
a
district
court
judge
might
confront
is
whether
you
should
cumulate
them
so
it
should
be,
as
justice
sotomayor's
question
suggests,
that
if
there
are
several
available
that
you
get
20
because
it's
a
machine
gun
and
10
because
it
was
discharged.
and
from
the
perspective
of
busy
district
court
judges,
a
provision
which
says
in
figuring
out
how
to
sentence
a
924(c)
offender,
you
don't
have
to
look
through
this
complex
statute
to
figure
out
what
your
sentencing
enhancements,
do
some
double
jeopardy
analysis,
all
you
need
to
do
is
simple
math.
you
are
directed
to
look
to,
of
all
the
ones
that
are
available,
the
one
that
is
longest
of
the
mandatory
minimums.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
though,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
all
of
this,
the
idea
that
it
really
isn't
that
critical
even
to
clarify
in
the
first
half
of
the
924(c)
and
as
it
reaches
externally,
is
about
clarifying
something
that
it
may
be
true
district
court
judges
otherwise
would
have
been
able
to
figure
out
had
they
done
a
lot
of
analysis,
but
it
makes
it
much
simpler
and
the
practical
utility
of
it
is
to
clarify
a
sentencing
judge's
options
with
respect
to
a
statute
that
has
been
made
much
more
complex.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
effect
of
the
"except"
clause
is
the
opposite,
which
is
it
makes
sure
that
a
judge
imposes
only
life
and
does
not
add
additional
sentences.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
and
i
agree,
from
the
perspective
of
a
defendant,
that
may
not
be
most
consequential.
but
this
is
a
provision
which,
taken
as
a
whole,
was
clarifying
not
just
externally
to
924(c),
but
also
internally
what
district
court
judges
should
do
with
a
complex--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
agree,
it's
not
practically
significant
to
a
defendant,
although
sentences
of
life
plus
additional
terms
or
consecutive
life
are
not
at
all
uncommon
in
the
code.
but
it
is
of
significance
to
district
court
judges
who
are
trying
to
figure
out
what
sentence
to
impose.
and
this
provision--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--yes.
i
do
not
interpret
930(c)
as
subject
to
the
"except"
clause.
i
believe
it
is
a
separate
offense
with
different
elements
and
under
the
double
jeopardy
analysis
that
would
apply
it
is
possible--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--yes.
although
930(c)--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--yes.
although
930(c)
does
not
require
the
killing
of
a
person,
it
extends
to
attempts--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
don't
believe
--
it
is
referred
to
only
in
petitioner
abbott's
brief
at
a
page
number
i
don't
recall.
it
is
not
one
of
the
provisions
that--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--because
930(c)
does
not
require
an
actual
killing
of
a
person.
it
extends
to
conspiracy
and
attempt.
therefore,
one
can
violate
930(c)
without
violating
924(c)
and
vice
versa.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
by
conspiring
or--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--or
by
attempting
to
do
so.
so
930(c)
has
a
broader
reach
because
of
these
vicarious
and
inchoate
forms
of
liability.
so
a
defendant
could
be
convicted
separately
of
930(c)
and
of
924(c).
they
are
not
the
same
offense
for
double
jeopardy--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--well,
i
think
when
you
place
this
in
the
context
of
the
1998
amendments
that
enacted
the
"except"
clause,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
former
is
more
plausible.
and
the
reason
i
say
that,
there
are
really
five
features
of
the
1998
amendments
that
illustrate
that
the
924(c)
offense,
but
rather
is
clarifying
which
sentence
to
impose.
the
first
is
that
the
1998
amendments,
setting
aside
the
924(c).
it
changed
what
had
been
mandatory
sentences
to
mandatory
all
the
way
to
life.
it
responded
to
this
court's
decision
in
bailey
by
increasing
the
substantive
scope
of
the
provision.
it
increased
the
--
it
created
increased
mandatory
minimums
for
7-year
and
10-year
offenses.
so
it
would
be
odd
to
think
that
in
the
second
half
of
a
presumptively
narrow
exception
clause,
congress
at
the
same
time
ran
in
the
direct
opposite
direction
and
had
a
substantial
rollback
of
preexisting
section
924(c)
sentencing
provisions.
and
that's
--
to
be
clear,
at
the
time
of
the
1998
amendments
these
petitioners
would
have
been
subject
to
the
mandatory
minimum
sentences
that
they
received.
they
would
have
been
subject
to
10
years
in
one
of
the
cases
for
the
drug
offense
and
5
additional
years
mandatory
and
consecutive
under
924(c).
for
the
other
they
--
he
would
have
been
subject
to
15
years
for
being
a
felon
in
possession
and
an
armed
career
criminal
and
5
additional
under
924(c).
so
one
of
the
features
that
is
key
is
putting
this
in
the
context
of
the
1998
amendments
which
were
in
every
respect--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--that
is
true.
but
that
is
not
a
rollback
of
preexisting
provisions.
it's
a
way
of--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--because
none
of
--
in
prior
924(c)
law,
there
wasn't
a
body
of
law
that
would
have
given
anybody
who
would
get
the
benefit
of
the
924(c)
a
higher
sentence.
what
all
--
what
the
7
or
10,
you
shouldn't
telescope
them
all
inside
924(c).
you
shouldn't
add
them
all
together;
you
pick
the
highest.
and
so
it
--
the
"except"
clause
is
not
a
rollback.
it
is
a
way
of
accommodating
and
giving
clear
direction
to
the
complexity
of
the
newly
enacted
provision.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
well,
section
924(c)
in
its
original
form
i
think
was
passed
in
the
1960s.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
on
the
general
approach
of
congress
under
924(c),
it
also
bears
note
that
in
the
last
25
years
congress
has
amended
section
924(c)
six
times,
and
setting
aside
for
a
moment
the
"except"
clause,
in
all
of
those
amendments
congress
has
uniformly
expanded
its
scope
or
increased
the
severity
of
sentences.
so
the
924(c).
and
there
are
several
other
features
of
the
1998
amendment
that
make
clear
that
that
is
not
what
congress
did.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
well,
this
court's
cases
make
it
clear
that
the
rule
of
lenity
comes
into
play
at
the
end
of
the
analysis
only
if
there
is
grievous
ambiguity
after
all
the
considerations
of
statutory
construction
have
been
considered.
we
haven't
yet
discussed
all
of
them
and
i
think
when
all
of
them
are
discussed,
there
is
no
grievous
ambiguity.
in
fact,
the
reading
that
we
suggest
is
the
only
reasonable
reading,
all
factors
considered.
and
if
i
can
turn
back
to
a
couple
of
other
features
of
the
1998
amendments,
another
feature
is
the
--
the
title
of
the
act
itself,
which
is
an
act
to
throttle
the
criminal
use
of
guns.
and
again
it's
just
inconsistent
with
the
provision
that
has
these
features
and
has
that
act,
and
it
would
be
a
substantial
important
decrease
in
the
mandatory
minimum
sentences
applicable
to
a
large
class--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
don't
--
that
would
push
the
argument
too
far.
i
think
it
is
highly
relevant
to
construing
this
--
the
statute
as
a
whole,
that
that
was
the
clear
overall
function
of
that
amendment.
now
there
are
two
other
features
of
the
1998
amendment,
which
are,
it
did
as
has
been
previously
noted
--
also,
the
only
other
thing
that
congress
did
in
the
1998
amendment,
other
than
modifying
section
924(c),
is
it
made
a
corresponding
change
in
section
3559(c)
to
--
to
correspond.
so
we
know
that
section
3559(c)
was
front
and
center
in
congress's
mind
as
it
was
enacting
the
1998
amendments
and
it
is
very
natural
when
congress
is
creating
a
more
complex
statute
and
giving
district
court
judges
guidance
about
which
mandatory
minimums
to
select
under
that
statute,
to
mention
and
have
language
that
accommodates
the
fact
that
there
is--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--no,
i
think
they
were
clarifying--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
think
it
clarifies
the
relationship,
and
in
fact
arguably
it
could
have
clarified
the
situation
in
a
way
that
would
have
been
beneficial
to
defendants.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
when
congress
enacted
the
first
half
of
the
924(c)
--
if
it
hadn't
mentioned
3559(c)
there
could
have
been
the
idea
that
if
there
--
if
congress
didn't
direct
the
same
approach
with
respect
to
3559(c),
there
is
an
implication
that
in
fact
you
should
impose
both.
and
so
what
it
really
was
doing
was
clarifying
what
would
have
been
unclear.
and
it
is
again,
only
half
of
a
presumptively
narrow
provision
which
is
just
clarifying
the
relationship--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--yes.
yes,
but
it's
not
saying
that
to
defendants.
it's
saying
that
to
busy
district
court
judges
who
just
need
to
know
in
a
simple,
clear
way,
what
am
i
supposed
to
--
what
sentence
am
i
supposed
to--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--well--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--well,
remember
that
it
was
--
although
it
is
not
hugely
consequent
actual
to
defendants,
it
was
a
provision
that
congress
was
directly
considering
then.
but
there
is
another
function,
which
is
it
creates
a
default
rule
for
future
similar
provisions
like
3559(c).
and
so
there
--
and
had
--
again
--
so
it's
not
limited
to
its
function
with
respect
to
3559(c),
it
also
serves,
as
congress
often
provides,
a
default
rule.
and
so
again
there
is
a
fifth
feature
of
the
1998
amendments
for
those
of
whom
this
is
concern,
which
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
provision
strongly
corroborates
our
interpretation.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
well,
i
--
there
are
--
there
are
other
provisions
that,
like
924(j),
which
do
provide
sentences
for
924(c)
offenses
that
are
codified
elsewhere
in
the
code.
and
with
respect
to
other
offenses
that
is
also
quite
common.
so
there
is
nothing
implausible
about
the
idea
that--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i'm
not
aware
that
--
that
congress
had
some
particular
pending
legislation
in
mind.
my
point
more
generally,
though,
is
that
it
is
quite
common
for
congress
to
provide
penalties
for
offense
a
in
a
different
section,
and
so
creating
a
default
rule
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
thing
for
congress
to
have
done
while
it
was
clarifying
the
internal
relationships
among
the
various
924(c)
provisions
and
the
provision
in
3559(c)
which
is
front
and
center
in
front
of
it.
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
the
"except"
clause
language
was
proposed
by
senator
jesse
helms.
in
the
legislative
provision
there
is
nowhere
any
comment
by
anyone
suggesting
that
anyone
understood
it
as
rolling
back
preexisting
section
924(c)
penalties
or
as
reflecting
a
new
policy
different
from
the
fundamental
policy
of
section
924(c),
which
has
always
been:
defendants
who
create
drug
trafficking
offenses
or
violent
crimes
and
who
involve
a
weapon
will
get
an
additional--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--there
is
no
explicit
reference
to
that.
but
that
is,
i
think,
a
good
inference
from
the
fact
that
all
of
the
other
explanations
are
far
more
implausible.
and
there
is
something
--
there
are
two
things
which
support
that
inference
more
specifically,
one
of
which
is,
again,
that
congress
did
have
in
front
of
it
section
3559(c)
and
was
amending
it.
the
second
is
that
the
sole
reference
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
except
clause
is
in
the
testimony
of
a
witness
at
a
hearing,
and
what
that
witness
said
about
it
was
that
it
will
prevent
confusion
with
other
provisions.
and
so
there
is,
i
think,
a
strong
indication--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
don't.
my
point
is
really
more
the
negative,
which
is
if
the
except
clause,
in
the
second
half
of
an
exception
that
is
in
its
first
part
intended
to
clarify,
was
instead
a
major
policy
shift
from
the
preexisting
policy
of
section
924(c),
additional
mandatory
consecutive
sentences.
and
instead
of
shift
over
to
sentences
which
we
will
try
to
adjust
or
ameliorate
in
light
of
other--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--two
responses.
two
responses,
justice
breyer,
one
of
which
is
that
congress
has
amended
924(c)
both
before
and
after
this
provision,
and
it's
clear
that
congress
is
not
shifting
from
a
mandatory
minimum
regime
to
a
regime
that
--
where
the
guidelines
are
relied
upon
to
provide
the
minimum
sentence
that
congress
requires.
and
it
is
a
shift
not
just
to
a
guidelines
regime,
because
if
this
a
major
policy
shift
into
a
different
world,
there
--
it
poses
a
question
of
statutory
construction
as
well,
not
just
about
guidelines.
and
that's
the
next
topic,
which
is--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--they
could
not
have
been,
even
in
the
pre-booker
world.
certainly,
in
the
post-booker
world,
they
cannot.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
but
the
point
is
that
congress
--
if
congress
was
shifting
in
the
except
clause,
the
question
is,
what
is
the
nature
of
that
policy
shift?
if
you
were
going
to
try
to
reduce
924(c)
sentences
to
accommodate
sentences
on
other
provisions
of
law,
instead
of
just
making
them
an
add-on
always,
then
there
is
a
question:
what
policy
should
you
pick?
should
you
pick
any
other
sentence
the
defendant
is
facing
at
this
sentencing?
should
you
pick
any
other
sentence
arising
out
of
this
transaction?
that
is
not
a
guidelines
issue.
that's
a
question
of:
what
is
the
policy
reflected
by
the
statute?
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
that
is
a
possible
policy,
to
be
sure,
but
one
thing:
it's
certainly
not
the
only
reasonable
policy.
you
could
focus
on
the
transaction
or
you
could
focus
on
what
the
defendant
is
facing
at
the
sentencing.
all
those
are
among
the
policy
options
you
could
consider.
and
what
is
interesting
is
that
petitioners
can't
agree
on
those
policy
options.
and
they
can't
agree
on
the
policy
options
because
section
924(c)
has
no
guidance
about
it.
and
the
reason
section
924(c)
has
no
guidance
about
it
is
because
congress
was
not
making
the
policy
choice
at
all.
congress
was
simply
clarifying
how
to
implement
the
preexisting
policy
under
924(c),
which
is
always
imposed,
for
a
section
924(c)
violator,
an
additional
separate
mandatory
minimum
sentence.
but
here
is
advice
about
how
to
do
that.
here
is
advice
about
how
to
do
that
internal
to
section
924(c).
here
is
advice
about
how
to
do
that
external
to
924(c)
under
3559(c)
and
with
a
default
rule
for
other
similar
provisions.
that
is
the
--
the
modest
objective
that
congress
was
attempting
to
achieve.
and
as
everyone
agrees--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--no--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--i
think
we
do,
and
the
reason
we
do
is
because,
in
our
view,
this
provision
operates
only
when
you
are
talking
about
prosecution
for
the
same
offense
in
double
jeopardy
purposes.
and
so
it's
not
possible
for,
under
our
submission,
for
the
government
to
prosecute
somebody
for
one
of
these
variants
of
section
924(c)
and
then
come
back
again
later
and
prosecute
again
and
then
manipulate
the
overall
structure
of
sentences,
because
they
are
the
same
offense.
if
you
move
outside
that,
into
things
that
are
not
the
same
offense
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
then
the
prospects
do
open
up
for
irrational
patterns
of
outcome
based
on
the
order
in
which
things
are
prosecuted,
and
in
addition,
irrational
patterns
of
the
mandatory
minimums
based
on--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
--mr.
abbott
has
two
readings,
and
our
reading
differs
from
each
of
them.
the
first
of
mr.
abbott's
readings
is
transactional
in
nature.
ours
is
focused
on
the
section
924(c)
offense
itself.
the
second
of
our
readings
is
--
the
second
of
mr.
abbott's
readings
is
focused
on
a
firearm,
just
the
fact
that
a
firearm
is
involved.
and
again,
ours
is
focused
on
the
use
of
a
firearm
in
a
way
that
constitutes
the
section
924(c)
offense.
so
those
are
the
differences.
but
if
i
could
just
point
out
the
other
anomalies,
there
are
two
other
anomalies
that
we
have
not
yet
touched
upon.
one
of
them
is
that
petitioner's
submissions
create
anomalous
patterns
of
floors
of
statutory
minimums,
as
we've
discussed
in
the
briefs.
if
a
defendant
under
petitioner's
submission,
the
principal
submission,
has
committed
a
drug
offense
that
carries
a
five-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence
and
brandishes
a
firearm,
it
is
--
carrying
a
seven-year
minimum,
the
floor
is
12
years.
if
that
defendant's
drug
offense
is
more
aggravated
and
carries
a
greater
sentence
so
that
there
is
a
10-year
mandatory
minimum,
the
overall
mandatory
minimum,
under
petitioner's
submission,
reduces
to
10.
and
there
is
the
further
anomaly
that
for
offenses
that
are
different,
the
petitioner's
submission
is
that
the
defendant
will
end
up,
although
adjudicated
guilty
of
a
section
924(c)
offense,
with
no
sentence
whatsoever.
there
will
be
a
free-floating
adjudication
of
guilt.
and
because
the
defendant,
let's
say,
is
a
felon
in
possession
and
is
sentenced
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
when
the
judge
goes
to
sentencing,
the
judge,
on
petitioner's
view,
says:
i
will
give
you
15
years
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act;
that
triggers
the
except
clause,
and
therefore,
i
impose
no
sentence
whatsoever
under
section
924(c).
that
also
is
an
anomaly.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese
that
is
true.
my
point
about
the
anomaly
is
just
that
it
is
very
strange,
to
my
knowledge
unheard
of,
to
have
a
judge
go
to
sentencing
and
have
a
series
of
adjudications
and
to
tell
the
judge
as
to
one
of
them
that
it's
not
the
greater
or
lesser
included
offense
of
another;
you
don't
even
need
to
impose
a
sentence
on
that
adjudication.
the
backdrop
basic
assumption
is,
on
each
of
the
adjudications,
you
impose
a
sentence.
now,
that
is
not
true
if
offenses
are
greater
or
lesser
or
are
the
same
offense,
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
but
under
petitioner's
submission,
that
is
true
with
respect
to
offenses
like
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm
and
being
someone
who
violated
924(c)
that
are
different
offenses
in
double
jeopardy
law
and
have
always
been
given
separate
judgments,
separate
punishments.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
would
request
that
the
judgements
below
be
affirmed.
