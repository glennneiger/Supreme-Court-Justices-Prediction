justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
you
keep
saying
that
you
are
not
reading
anything
into
the
statute
under
your
interpretation,
but
you
are.
you
are
limiting
the
--
the
"any
other
provision
of
law"
to
any
other
provision
of
law
specified
in
the
charging
--
in
the
counts
of
conviction,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
--
you
said
to
justice
alito
that
you
weren't
reading
anything
in,
but
you
are.
you
are
reading
into
it
that
the
other
provision
of
law
to
refer
to
counts
of
conviction
at
sentencing,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
why
is
that
read-in
logical,
meaning
it's
giving
no
extra
punishment
for
the
possession
of
a
firearm?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
is,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg's.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
explain
how,
because
you
just
said
to
justice
scalia
that
if
the
mandatory
minimum
is
in
a
separate
charging
instrument,
then
it
doesn't
affect
you
at
all.
it
only
affects
you
if
the
count
is
in
a
count
of
conviction
at
sentencing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
in
the
language
of
924(c)
sets
forth
that
limitation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
their
"otherwise
provided
by
law"
could
be
federal,
state
laws.
it
could
be
in
the
indictment,
not
in
the
indictment.
you
are
proposing
that
we
limit
this
somehow,
but
i
want
to
see
what
the
language
is
that
you
are
relying
upon
to
limit
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
relationship
to
what?
isn't
that
the
government's
argument,
which
is
that
you
have
to
say
in
relationship
to
something,
whether
it's
the
indictment
or,
as
the
government
would
have
it,
in
relationship
to
the
possession
or
carrying
of
a
firearm?
why
isn't
that
the
more
natural
reading?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
justice
breyer
is
reading
a
bit
what
your
co-counsel
is
advocating,
what
mr.
abbott
is
arguing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
930(c):
a
person
who
kills
any
person
in
the
course
of
bringing
a
firearm
into
a
federal
facility
shall
be
punished
as
provided
in
sections
setting
forth
minimums
for
murder
and
manslaughter.
so
it
would
also
have
an
effect
in
930(c),
no?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
wasn't
sure
why
it
didn't
list
930,
but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
know,
but
its
brief
does
two
formulations.
it
says--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--anything
that
affects
924(c);
and
then
in
other
places
in
its
brief
it
says
the
--
"the
"except"
clause
refers
to
any
higher
minimum
sentence
for
possessing,
using
or
carrying
a
firearm
in
relationship
to
a
drug
or
--
drug
offense
or
a
crime
of
violence.
"
those
are
two
different
formulations.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
am
focusing
on
the
second
formulation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--charging--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
could
i
just
ask
one
simple
question,
the
one
i
started
with
earlier,
which
was,
which
of
the
two
statements
are
you
advocating,
that
the
924(c)
explicitly,
or
are
you
saying
the
"except"
clause
--
and
i'm
quoting
from
your
brief,
in
two
different
places
--
"the
"except"
clause
refers
to
a
higher
minimum
sentence
for
possessing,
using
a
firearm
in
relationship
to
a
crime
of
violence
or
a
drug
offense?
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
if
that's
the
case,
your
adversary
just
said,
mr.
abbott's
attorney
just
said,
that
you
don't
believe
that
section
924(c)(1)(a)
is
trumped
by
924(c)(1)(b)
or
by
18
u.s.c.
section
930(c).
is
his
allegation
correct
or
is
he
wrong?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
so
that
if
he
discharges
a
firearm
and
it
says
it
is
a
sentence
of
not
less
than
10
years
and
he
--
and
that
firearm
is
also
a
short
barrelled
rifle
with
a
10
year
minimum,
does
he
get
10
years
or
does
he
get
20
years?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
it's
a
machine
gun
where
there
is
a
30-year
minimum,
does
he
get
40
or
30?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
you
do
with
930(c)?
don't
leave
without
answering
my
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
your
answer
to
me
was,
you
read
the
"except"
clause
as
applying
to
any
higher
minimum
sentence
for
possessing,
using
or
carrying
a
firearm
in
relationship
to
a
drug
offense
or
crime
of
violence.
isn't
killing
a
person
a
crime
of
violence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
isn't
bringing
of
a
firearm
into
a
federal
facility
the
carrying
of
a
firearm?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
but
i'm
still
trying
to
understand
your
position,
which
is
--
i
read
what
you
said
to
me
the
930(c)
and
i
couldn't
figure
out
why
you
didn't
list
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
a
person
who
kills
any
person--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
how
is
your
reading
different
from
mr.
abbott's?
