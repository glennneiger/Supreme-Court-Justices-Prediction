mr.
richard
h.
seamon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
question
that
has
arisen
already
as
to
what
hourly
rate
a
court
does
look
at
and
should
look
at
in
calculating
the
lodestar.
i
would
note
that
at
page
14
of
the
aba's
brief
they
mention
that
the
only
ascertainable
prevailing
market
rate
is
the
rate
charged
to
clients
who
pay
regardless
of
the
outcome.
so
as
a
practical
matter
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
find
lawyers
in
the
market
who
tell
their
clients
i
will
charge
you
$25
an
hour
if
you're
willing
to
pay
regardless
of
whether
we
win
or
lose,
but
if
you
want
me
to
take
this
on
a
contingency
basis
then
i'm
going
to
charge
you
$40
an
hour.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
think
that
that
is
still
the
prevailing
practice,
that
when
a
lawyer
takes
a
contingency,
makes
a
contingency
arrangement
he
contracts
with
the
client
for
some
percentage
of
the
ultimate
recovery.
now,
justice
stevens
raised
the
question
well,
what
if
you
can
get
an
economist
to
come
in
and
say
i
have
looked
at
all
of
these
contingency
arrangements
and
i
have
decided
that
in
fact
they
end
up
amounting
to
$40
an
hour
of
compensation
for
the
lawyers
rather
than
25.
we
would
say
that
it
may
be
fair
in
that
case
for
a
lawyer
to
charge
$40
to
his
client,
but
the
fairness
in
that
instance
resides
on
the
fact
that
it
is
the
product
of
the
consensual
arrangement
between
the
plaintiff
and
his
client.
in
the
fee-shifting
context
the
situation
is
very
different.
there
isn't
this
consensual
relationship
at
all
that
determines
the
payment.
in
fact
the
defendant
in
the
case
is
required
to
pay
the
plaintiff
not
based
on
the
defendant's
conduct
that
led
to
the
suit
in
the
first
place,
and
for
that
matter
not
based
on
the
defendant's
conduct
during
the
trial,
but
based--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
correct.
or
to
put
it
another
way,
the
fact
that
it
is
consensually
agreed
to
is
what
makes
it
the
market,
you
know,
what
the
market
calls
for
and
what
the
market
will
provide.
the
fee-shifting
context
by
definition
is
very
different.
the
very
existence
of
the
fee-shifting
provisions
means
that
the
normal
market
is
not
going
to
operate
in
fee-shifting
litigation--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
correct,
you
do
have
to
look
outside--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes,
it
may
be
possible
to
establish
a
market
figure
that
prevails
in
the
private,
unregulated
market,
but
to
apply
that
in
the
context
of
fee-shifting
is
to
say
that
the
defendant
should
pay
not
on
the
basis
of
what
he
did
that
led
to
the
lawsuit
but
on
the
basis
of
what
arrangement
the
plaintiff
has
made
with
his
client.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
i
was
assuming
in
my
earlier
answers
that
you
can
come
up
with
a
fee
of
$40
per
hour
that
are
charged
by
contingency
lawyers.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no,
i
think
that
normally
the
percentage
of
recovery
is
going
to
in
large
part
reflect
the
amount
at
stake
as
well
as
the
merits
of
the
particular
case.
and--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
correct.
and
that
reasoning
also
punishes
defendants
who
have
the
most
meritorious
defenses.
the
defendants
who
are
most
difficult
to
prevail
against
should
in
theory,
under
the
theory
that
our
opponents
espouse,
be
charged
the
highest
bonuses
because
they
are--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--in
practice
it
has
turned
out
to
be
largely
irrelevant
because
the
hourly--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--not
as
a
separate
matter,
justice
kennedy,
because
the
difficulty
of
the
case
is
going
to
be
reflected
both
in
the
hourly
rate
that
a
lawyer
of
the
adequate
experience
is
able
to
charge
as
well
as
the
number
of
hours
expended
in
litigating
the
case.
presumably
the
more
difficult
the
case,
the
harder
it
will
be
to
litigate,
the
more
hours
expended,
and
the
higher
the
lodestar.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no,
we
think
that
the
probability
of
success
is
irrelevant
in
calculating
the
lodestar
and
also
should
be
irrelevant
as
a
separate
matter--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--basically
right.
most
of
the
circuits
have
attempted
to
follow
this
court's
decision
in
delaware
valley
ii
by
taking
the
approach
proposed
in
the
concurring
decision
there
and
look
to
whether
the
plaintiff
had
actual
difficulty
in
getting
counsel,
and
secondly
how,
if
at
all,
the
market
compensates
for
contingency.
i
just
want
to
emphasize
the
first
point
that,
even
assuming
we
get
beyond
these
evidentiary
difficulties
and
decide
that
in
fact
the
contingency
market
charges
$40
an
hour,
it
is
still
very
different
from
saying
that
that's
fair
to
charge
a
client,
to
go
from
that
conclusion
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
fair
to
make
a
defendant
pay.
again,
this
charge
is
not
based
on
the
defendant's
conduct,
but
is
based
on
whatever
arrangement
the
plaintiff
has
made
with
his
attorney,
and
we
don't
think
that
congress
intended
the
term
reasonable
attorney's
fee
to
mean
different
things
depending
simply
on
what
arrangement
the
plaintiff
has
made
with
his
attorney.
and
in
fact
this
court
rejected
a
similar
view
of
congressional
intent
in
blanchard
v.
bergeron
where
it
held
that
the
amount
of
the
fee
cannot
be
determined
by
whatever
contract
the
plaintiff
has
made
with
his
attorney.
the
same
principle
operates
here.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i'm
sorry,
i
don't--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it
absolutely
is
irrelevant
in
our
view
as
well.
nonetheless
many
of
the
lower
courts,
including
the
court
in
this
case,
has
held
that
this
arrangement,
this
contingency
arrangement
that
was
in
fact
made
is
a
basis
for
enhancing
the
lodestar
fee
by
25
percent.
beyond
the
evidentiary
problems,
and
we
think
the
unfairness
problem
that
this
confronts
or
assumes
that
congress
intended,
there
are
a
number
of
fundamental
conceptual
difficulties
with
the
market
theory
that
is
driving
our
opponent's
position.
in
our
view
one
essential
flaw
is
that
it
assumes
that
litigation
under
fee-shifting
statutes
should
operate
in
the
same
way
as
litigation
does
in
the
private
market.
but
in
fact
the
very
existence
of
the
fee-shifting
provision
radically
alters
the
way
the
litigation
will
proceed,
as
this
court
recognized
in
evans
v.
jeff
d..
in
a
fee-shifting
case
there
is
this
prospect
of
a
lodestar
or
some
sort
of
award
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
litigation
that
will
influence
the
way
a
defendant
considers
litigating
the
case
and
influence
the
defendant's
judgments
about
making
a
settlement
or
not.
that
same
dynamic
doesn't
operate
in
the
typical
contingency
case
where
the
plaintiff
in
a
personal
injury
suit,
for
example,
pays
the
same
amount
as
a
judgment
whether
the
plaintiff
has
a
contingency
arrangement
with
his
attorney
or
not,
and
if
there
is
a
contingency
arrangement
whether
the
attorney
is
going
to
get
25
percent
or
40
percent.
the
only
point
here
is
that
the
dynamics
are
different,
and
so
there's
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
litigation
should
operate
the
way
the
market
operates.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
thank
you.
