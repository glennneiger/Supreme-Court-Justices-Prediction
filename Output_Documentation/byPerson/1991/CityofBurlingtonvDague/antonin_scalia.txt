justice

do
you
think
you
can
establish
such
a
contingent
fee
in
the
private
market
for
a
category
of
cases?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
isn't
it
the
nature
of
a
contingent
fee
that
it
depends
enormously
upon
how
good
the
case
looks
to
the
lawyer?
justice
scalia
for
a
whole
category,
but
i
don't...
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
likely.
justice
scalia
and
the
latter
would
be
quite,
quite
counter-productive
as
far
as
the
policies
of
this
statute
are
concerned.
that
is
the
riskier
the
case,
the
higher
the
fee
you
should
get.
whereas
the
statute
wants
to
reward
lawyers
for
taking
worthy
cases.
and
what
you're
saying
is
the
less
worthy
the
case,
the
higher
the
fee.
justice
scalia
that
is
all
by
contractual
agreement.
i
mean,
i
suppose
that
in
a
particular
case
a
lawyer
on
a
non-contingent
basis
can
cut
a
deal
with
a
client.
even
though
the
market
is
$60,
he
may
agreed
with
the
client
for
$80.
but
that's
by
special
contractual
agreement.
now,
we
wouldn't
allow
the
$80
fee
to
be
recovered
simply
because
they
bargained
for
it,
so
why
should
we
allow
the
higher
contingent
fee
to
be
recovered
just
because
they
bargained
for
it?
justice
scalia
it's
harder
to
do
that
when
the
later
law
is
a
specific
response
to
a
judicial
decision
that
has
come
in
the
interim,
because
if...
if
you
know
what
i
mean.
it
may
be
an
indication
that
that
congress
thought
that
the
judicial
decision
was
wrong,
in
which
case
they
would
have
meant
without
that
qualification
what
they
meant
in
the
earlier
statute.
are
you
following
me?
justice
scalia
and
that
was
not
the
case
in
casey.
there
you
had
qualifications
upon
the
term
that
had
been
adopted
down
through
the
years
and
not
in
response
to
any
particular
line
of
jurisprudence.
justice
scalia
but
not
particularly
on
contingencies.
i
mean,
that's
the
only
kind
of
restriction
that
i
think
really,
really
speaks
clearly
to
what
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
scalia
no,
but,
but
you
have
some
later
statute
that
specifically
says
shall
not
include
any
amount
for
contingency.
justice
scalia
bonus
or
multipliers.
justice
scalia
that's
impressive.
i
don't
think
the
mere
fact,
however,
that
some
other
statutes
limit
the
upper
amount
or
said
not
in
excess
of
10
percent,
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
speaks
to
whether
congress
thought
that
a
contingent
fee
would
be
allowed.
justice
scalia
no,
i
want
you
to.
i
mean,
i'm
not
raising
it
with
you
for,
you
know--
justice
scalia
there's
no
market
for
contingent
fees
in
non-monetary
cases.
i
mean,
there
are
for
sherman
act
cases,
but
for
cases
seeking
injunction
against
federal
action,
what's
the
contingent
fee
market
here?
you're
going
to
have
to
make
it
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
sorry,
i
am
up
again
right
away.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
presents
a
question
that
we
addressed
but
did
not
resolve
five
years
ago
in
the
case
of
pennsylvania
versus
delaware
valley
citizens'
council
for
clean
air,
otherwise
known
as
delaware
valley
ii.
that
question
is
whether
under
the
typical
federal
statute
awarding
attorney's
fees
to
a
prevailing
party,
a
court
may
enhance
the
fee
award
above
the
so-called
lodestar
amount.
i
will
describe
what
that
is.
whether
a
court
may
enhance
it
above
that
in
order
to
reflect
the
fact
that
the
party's
attorneys
were
retained
on
a
contingent
fee
basis
and
thus,
assume
the
risk
of
receiving
no
payment
at
all
for
their
services
if
their
clients
were
to
lose
the
case.
the
respondents
here
owned
land
in
vermont
adjacent
to
landfill
owned
and
operated
by
the
city
of
burlington.
they
sued
the
city
over
its
operation
of
the
landfill.
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
city
had
violated
provisions
of
the
solid
waste
disposal
act
and
the
clean
water
act
and
it
determined
that
respondents
were
the
substantially
prevailing
parties
under
the
fee
award
provisions
of
the
statute
and,
therefore,
were
entitled
to
their
attorney's
fees.
in
calculating
the
fee
award,
the
district
court
first
determined
the
lodestar
amount.
that
is
done
by
taking
the
number
of
hours
reasonably
expended
by
the
attorneys
and
multiplying
those
hours
by
a
reasonable
hourly
rate
for
the
attorneys.
the
district
court
then
went
on,
however,
to
augment
that
lodestar
amount
by
25%
on
the
ground
that
the
respondents'
attorneys
were
retained
on
a
contingent
fee
basis
and
that
without
such
enhancement
respondents
would
have
faced
substantial
difficulties
in
obtaining
suitable
counsel.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
fee
award.
we,
today,
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
adapt
the
position
taken
in
justice
white's
principal
opinion
in
delaware
valley
ii.
so
you
will
have
the
rare
occasion
today
to
hear
one
of
justice
white's
opinions
even
if
second
hand
from
the
bench.
we
hold
that
the
fee
shifting
statutes
at
issue
do
not
permit
enhancement
of
the
lodestar
amount
on
account
of
contingency.
respondents
request
us
to
adapt
the
position
advocated
by
the
concurrence
in
delaware
valley
ii
under
which
contingency
enhancement
would
be
permitted
in
some
circumstances.
for
reasons
explained
more
fully
in
our
opinion,
we
believe
that
position
is
unworkable
and
largely
circular
and
would
not
promote
its
supposed
goal
of
mirroring
market
incentives.
we
also
conclude
more
generally
that
no
contingency
enhancement
is
compatible
with
the
fee
shifting
statutes
at
issue
because
it
would
in
effect
pay
for
the
attorney's
time
or
anticipated
time
in
cases
where
his
client
does
not
prevail
and
is
thus,
at
odds
with
the
prevailing
party
language
of
the
statutes.
moreover,
contingency
enhancement
is
inconsistent
with
our
general
rejection
of
the
contingent
fee
model
in
favor
of
the
lodestar
model
as
the
method
for
determining
fee
awards
and
is
not
necessary
to
the
determination
of
a
reasonable
fee.
finally,
it
would
create
burdensome
satellite
litigation
by
making
the
setting
of
fees
more
complex
and
arbitrary.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
stevens
has
joined,
and
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
