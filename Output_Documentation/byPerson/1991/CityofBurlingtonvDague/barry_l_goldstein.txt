mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
did
congress
mean
by
the
term
reasonable
attorney's
fees?
there
is
no
dispute
on
this
record
or
by
the
parties
that
contingent
risk
of
non-payment
is
taken
into
account
on
occasion
in
the
legal
marketplace.
in
fact
the
city
asserts
in
its
brief
that
the
lodestar
calculation
already
reflects
consideration
of
contingency,
apparently
because
contingency
is
taken
into
account
in
the
legal
marketplace.
in
its
reply
brief,
the
city
reiterates
that
point.
if
the
market
compensates
for
risk
of
loss
contingency,
determination
of
the
market
rate
subsumes
and
incorporates
that
factor.
we're
not
here
today
to
argue
whether
or
not
contingency
should
be
taken
into
account
in
that
mythical
term,
or
that
real
term
now
that
it
has
been
adopted
by
the
court,
lodestar,
or
after
a
lodestar
is
determined
by
an
enhancement
or
adjustment.
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
risk
of
non-payment
because
of
the
contingent
nature
of
a
case
should
be
taken
into
account.
there
is
no
question
that
that
is
taken
into
account
in
the
legal
marketplace.
congress
has
legislated--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--well,
that's
a
good
question,
is
how--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--in
this
particular
case
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
attorneys
in
the
burlington,
vermont
market
expect
a
higher
return
for
their
hourly
time
when
they
take
a
case
on
a
contingent
basis.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
that's
one
way
that
it
can
be
shown,
as
to
what
expected
hourly
rate
will
be
satisfactory
for
a
lawyer
to
invest,
as
mr.
pearson
did,
7
years
of
time
and
3,000
hours
with
only
a
chance
of
getting
paid.
what
anticipated
hourly
rate?
there
are
also
other
types
of
evidence
available
on
that.
justice
stevens
pointed
to
his
experience
in
private
practice,
and
we
have
lodged
with
the
court
a
series
of
declarations
that
have
been
used
in
fee-shifting
statutes,
and
there's
a
declaration
of
a
mr.
camen
who
is
a
partner
at
jenner
and
block
in
chicago
in
which
he
attaches
the
agreement
that
jenner
and
block
entered
into
with
mci
in
the
big
antitrust
lawsuit
against
at&t,
in
which
mci
agreed
to
take
half
of
their
normal
hourly
rate,
a
partial
contingency--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--yes,
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
thank
you.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
and
if
they
succeeded
then
they
would
get
paid
2.5
times
their
hourly
rate,
and
that's
set
forth
in
the
agreement.
another
way
of
proving...
excuse
me.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
the
one
contract,
the
contract
that
mr.
camen
attaches
to
his
declaration,
would
not
determine
the
market,
but
it
would
be
evidence
of
the
market.
the
market
would
be
determined
by
all
of
the
contracts,
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
put
before
a
court
by
both
sides
in
order
to
present
what
the
market
would
pay
a
lawyer
for
a
comparable
case.
that
is
what
congress,
we
submit,
intended
by
adopting
the
term
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
congress
has
used
this
term
for
over,
for
approximately
80
years,
in
a
whole
series
of
statutes,
statutes
enacted
way
before
the
environmental
statutes
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
yes.
the
only
proof
in
this
case
is
that
there
would
need
to
be
an
enhanced
hourly
rate,
that
is
an
enhancement
over
what
is
paid,
win
or
lose,
in
order
to
get
a
lawyer
in
the
burlington
market.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
well,
like
the
standard
adopted
by
justice
o'connor,
the
proof
depended
upon
what
was
generally
expected
in
the
burlington,
vermont
market,
and
mr.
pearson
and
the
dagues
put
in
the
affidavits
of
three
practitioners
in
the
burlington
market
in
addition
to
three
affidavits
by
members
of
the
firm
saying
that
there
was
no
incentive
to
take
a
case
without
an--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
issue
before
this
court,
the
question
presented
is
whether
district
courts
have
under
any
circumstances
the
discretion
to
consider
the
risk
of
non-payment
in
determining
what
is
a
reasonable
fee,
not
the
method.
the
lower
courts
both
said
that,
but
for
the
opportunity
for
enhancement
to
an
hourly
rate,
there
would
be
substantial
difficulties
for
a
plaintiff
to
obtain
counsel
in
the
vermont
marketplace.
prior
to
the
passage
of
these
statutes
it
was
common
under
the
reasonable
fee
provision
in
the
antitrust
statutes,
in
the
securities
statutes,
for
lower
courts
to
take
into
account
contingent
risk
of
non-payment
in
determining
a
reasonable
fee.
it
was
against
this
backdrop
that
congress
legislated
in
the
environmental
area
and
adopted
the
reasonable
fee
statute
in
the
1970's.
in
interpreting
these
statutes
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
environmental
statutes
in
the
seventies,
clearly
risk
of
non-payment
was
taken
into
account.
congress
has
to
be
credited
with
knowing
how
a
statutory
term
that
they
used
in
the
1970's
has
been
interpreted
from
1914
when
the
clayton
act
was
passed
until
the
1970's.
this
is
especially
true
where,
as
pointed
out
by
the
american
bar
association
in
a
forceful
way
in
its
amicus
brief,
that
the
fact
that
contingent
risk
is
taken
into
account
in
the
american
legal
marketplace
is
notorious.
everyone
knows
it.
now,
how
it's
taken
into
account
in
a
specific
case
may
vary.
all
that
we
are
saying
is
that
the
court
should
not
turn
a
blind
eye
to
the
reality
of
the
legal
marketplace
and
permit,
where
appropriate,
local
courts
to
consider
the
risk
of
contingent
non-payment.
moreover--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--a
2.0
claim,
that
is
a
doubling.
the
court
ruled
that
a
1.25,
that
is
a
25
percent
enhancement
was
appropriate
and
would
prevent--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--a
doubling.
yes.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
the
court,
as
courts
do,
sometimes
reject
experts,
sometimes
reject
testimony
and
sometimes
accept
it
in
part.
and
of
course--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--well,
this
court--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--i'm
not
sure
if
the
question
goes
to
what
this
judge
did
or
if
it's
a
general
question
that
you're
asking
me,
justice
white.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
okay.
what
this
court
did
was
not
look
at
the
risk
of
this
particular...
excuse
me.
this
court
did
look
at
the
risk
of
this
particular
case
and
say
that
it
was
a
risk--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--no.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
no.
i
don't
think--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--excuse
me.
we
think
that
the
approach
suggested
by
justice
o'connor
in
delaware
valley
ii
is
the
appropriate
way
of
determining
whether
an
enhancement
should
be
awarded,
and
if
so,
the
degree
of
the
enhancement.
and
that
is
to
look
at
the
risk
in
a
comparable
class
of
cases,
which
in
this
particular
situation
would
be
complex
contingent
civil
litigation
in
the
vermont
marketplace.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
whatever
the
evidence
would
show.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
2.0,
actually.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
yes.
but
the
analysis
that
was
done
in
this
case,
and
again
the
issue
of
how
it
should
be
done
is
not
before
the
court--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--well,
i
think
there's
a
time...
well,
perhaps
we
should
have,
but
we
did
not.
and
the
only
issue
that's
before
this
court
is
whether
enhancement
for
contingent
risk
can
be
taken
into
account
under
any
conditions
by
the
local
courts
like
this
judge
did.
let
me
just
add
one
other
thing
to
answering
your
question,
justice
white,
and
that
is
unlike
some
of
the
technical
issues
that
were
before
the
court
in
this
case,
that
is
the
extent
of
the
toxic
waste
in
this
particular
dump
and
how
it
was
impacting
on
the
burlington
marketplace,
which
i
don't
think
the
local
judge,
i
may
be
wrong,
had
any
particular
knowledge
about,
determining
the
legal
marketplace
and
appropriate
and
reasonable
attorney's
fees
is
something
that,
as
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions,
that
courts
have
familiarity
with.
justice
stevens
referred
back
to
his
experience
in
private
practice.
judge
billings
has
a
lot
of
experience
as
a
state
court
judge,
as
a
federal
court
judge,
as
a
practitioner
in
the
local
marketplace
in
burlington.
there
should
not
be
a
national
rule.
the
situation
may
be
quite
different
in
burlington,
vermont
and
where
i
practice
in
oakland,
california.
moreover,
congress
well
knows
how
to
limit
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
it
has
done
that
on
many
occasions.
in
these
statutes
congress
put
a
standard,
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
congress
placed
no
limits
on
this
standard
as
congress
has
done
in
many
other
statutes.
to
name
just
a
couple,
in
the
individuals
with
disabilities
in
education
act
congress
said
no
bonus
or
multiplier
may
be
used
in
the
calculation
of
the
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
there
was
no
such
restriction
in
this
case.
in
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
congress
said
reasonable
attorney's
fees,
prevailing
market
rates,
but
not
more
than
$75
an
hour.
there
is
a
host,
as
this
court
well
knows,
of
other
statutes
with
limitations
on
fees.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
well,
i
think
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
think
it
goes
to
prove
our
point
rather
than
undercut
it.
because
for
example,
let's
take
the
individuals
with
disabilities
in
education
act
which
was
passed
in
1986.
in
that
statute
there
was
a
limitation
put
on
bonuses
and
multipliers.
at
almost
the
exact
same
time
as
this
act
was
passed
congress
also
passed
the
superfund
law
amending,
cercla,
to
put
in
a
citizens'
suit
provision.
in
that
law,
passed
at
the
same
time
when
the
limitation
was
put
in
the
idea
statute,
congress
put
in
the
superfund
law
the
exact
same
reasonable
attorney's
fees
statute
as
exists
in
the
two
statutes
before
this
court,
the
clean
water
act
and
rcra.
and
i
think
when
you
take
all
of
these
statutes
together
you
come
to
a
conclusion
that
congress,
under
these
statutes
where
it
did
not
put
limitations
on
reasonable
attorney's
fees,
meant
for
the
market
to
govern,
and
that
contingent
risk
may
be
taken
into
account
under
appropriate
circumstances.
justice
scalia's
statement
in
casey
i
think
is
right
to
the
point,
where
the
court
said
a
comparison
of
statutes
is
proper
because
statutes
are
construed
to
contain
that
permissible
meaning
which
fits
most
logically
and
comfortably
with
the
body
of
both
previously
and
subsequently
enacted
law.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
i
am,
but...
perhaps
i
am--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--i'm
not
trying
to
say
that's
a
direct
relationship
with
casey,
it's
just
the
principle.
but
i
think
my
answer
to
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question
still
applies,
and
that
is
congress
certainly
looked
with
open
eyes
to
the
possibility
of
contingency
fee
enhancements
after
a
certain
point
and
decided
to
include
such
enhancements
in
some
statutes
and
not
in
others.
in
a
statute
very
much
like
the
ones
before
this
court,
congress
decided
not
to
place
a
restriction.
and
let
me
just
add
one
other
part
to
it.
there
were
restrictions
on
fees
that
congress
put
in
prior
to
1972
and
prior
to
when
anybody,
as
far
as
i
know,
heard
of
the
term
lodestar.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
well,
in
the
american-mexican
chamizal
convention
act
of
1964
reasonable
attorney's
fees
shall
not
exceed
10
percent
of
the
amount
awarded,
and
similar
restrictions--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--well,
for
bonus
or
multipliers.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
you
know,
i
really
think
that--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--justice
scalia,
i
hate
to
argue
with
you
if
you
say
an
argument
you
heard
was
impressive--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--but
let
me
just
say
that
i
think
that,
you
know,
the
terms
changed.
and,
you
know,
bonus,
multipliers,
lodestar,
i
don't
think
congress
would
have
thought
in
those
terms
in
the
1940's
and
the
1950's
or
the
early
1960's.
what
they
thought
about
when
they
wanted
to
limit
contingency
enhancements
was
limit
the
percentage,
and
that's
exactly
what
congress
did.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
reasonable
attorney's
fees
which
shall
not
exceed
10
percent
of
the
amount
awarded.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
above
the
amount
of
risk
reflected
by
the
10
percent.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
well,
there
was
a
limitation
on
what
could
be
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
by
the
definition
under
that
act.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
i
think
congress
determined
that
a
reasonable
attorney's
fees
under
a
particular
act
which
could
be
reasonable
with
limits,
but
with
other
acts,
such
as
the
ones
before
this
court,
a
reasonable
attorney's
fees
would
be
one
that
would
be
motored
by
the
economic
forces
in
the
legal
marketplace
without
limit,
other
than
the
limit
of
the
discipline
of
the
marketplace.
i
don't
think
this
question
is
a
lot
different
in
theory
or
practice
than
many
other
questions
that
this
court
has
wrestled
with
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
the
term
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
in
wrestling
with
these
other
terms
this
court
has
looked
to
the
marketplace.
for
example,
in
blum
v.
stenson
the
court
considered
what
should
be
the
hourly
rate
factor
that's
involved
in
the
lodestar.
the
court
said
that
the
hourly
rate
would
be
calculated
by
prevailing
market
rates
for
similar
services
by
lawyers
of
reasonably
comparable
skill,
experience,
and
reputation.
again,
go
to
the
market.
in
missouri
v.
jenkins
the
issue
of
delay
came
up.
should
delay
be
compensated
for.
that
is
mr.
pearson
has
put
in
more
than
3,000
hours
in
this
case
to
close
the
toxic
dump
in
burlington.
he
has
not
gotten
paid
a
penny.
he
advanced
$16,000
out
of
his
own
pocket.
he
hasn't
gotten
reimbursed
yet.
should
the
delay
in
payment
be
compensated
for.
in
missouri
v.
jenkins
the
court
said
that
since
the
market
treats
compensation
paid
years
after
it
was
rendered
differently
from
compensation
paid
when
the
services
were
rendered,
courts
may
consider
delay
in
determining
a
reasonable
fee.
without
going
into
it,
the
court
also
looked
to
the
marketplace
to
determine
what
is
appropriate
compensation
for
paralegals
and
law
clerks,
which
is...
and
relied
on
the
market.
compensation
for
paralegals
and
law
clerks
is
nowhere
near
as
embedded
in
the
marketplace
for
legal
services
in
this
country
as
is
payment
for
contingent
risk.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
as
this
court
has
directed
local
courts
to
look
at
the
marketplace
to
resolve
these
other
questions
which
can
be
difficult,
the
court
should
also
direct
lower
courts
to
look
at
the
marketplace
to
determine
payment
for
the
contingent
risk
of
non-payment.
the
last
part
of
my
argument
is
that
justice
o'connor's
test,
which
borrows
in
significant
part
from
justice
white's
opinion
in
delaware
valley,
is
workable.
not
only
is
it
workable,
but
it
has
worked.
the
court
now
has
the
experience
of
several
years
of
implementation
of
the
delaware
valley
test.
nine
circuits
have
applied
it.
we
go
through
the
way
the
circuits
have
applied
it
in
our
brief,
and
courts
have
applied
it.
they
have
awarded
contingent
risk
in
some
cases--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--i
have
two
answers
to
that.
first,
it
is
not...
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
enhancement
was
correctly
calculated
in
this
case
is
not
before
the
court
in
the
question
presented.
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
the
court
had
discretion.
if
the
court
limits
its
opinion
in
this
case
to
the
question
presented,
then
it
should
affirm.
if
the
court
sets
a
standard
and
as
we
suggest
adopt
justice
o'connor's
standard
and
feels
that
it
should
apply
to
this
case
even
though
it's
outside
the
question
presented,
then
of
course
it
should
remand
the
case.
justice
o'connor's
test
we
believe
provides
the
answer
to
a
lot
of
the
legitimate
concerns
raised
by
justice
white
in
the
opinion
in
delaware
valley.
if,
as
justice
o'connor
suggest,
contingent
enhancement
is
based
upon
a
comparable
class
of
cases,
then
the
discipline
of
the
market
serves
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
it
serves
to
weed
out
the
less
worthy
cases.
an
attorney,
as
we
suggest--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--well,
the
congress
addressed
that
problem,
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
there
are
attorney
fee
statutes
in
a
case
like
this
in
which
there,
it
principally
is
focused
on
an
injunction
to
close
the
toxic
landfill
or
a
civil
rights
case
where
it's
to
integrate
a
plant.
and
congress
said
that
the
court
should
look
to
cases
in,
comparable
cases,
and
in
particular,
and
i'm
now
referring
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1976
civil
rights
act
which
courts
have
looked
to,
cases
that
present
a
comparable
difficulty,
such
as
antitrust
cases,
and
particularly
said
that
civil
rights
plaintiffs
should
not
be
put
in
a
different
and
less
beneficial
place--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--in
the
senate
report--
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
--congress...
yes.
congress
relied
on
the
term
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
term
reasonable
attorney's
fees
has,
as
i
have
discussed,
been
used
to
focus
the
courts
upon
the
relevant
market
as
best
as
the
courts
can
find
it.
in
conclusion,
local
courts
have
discretion
to
consider
the
risk
of
non-payment
as
a
part
of
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
the
courts
should
have
that
discretion,
just
as
local
courts
consider
other
aspects
of
the
award
of
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
in
the
legal
marketplace
fixed
fees
are
treated
differently,
generally
treated
differently
than
contingent
fees.
the
two
should
not
be
considered
the
same
in
the
determination
of
a
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
justice
white,
i
would
disagree
with
you
on
that,
but
the
important
point
is
that
congress
has
decided
that
question
and
determined
that
only
prevailing
parties
obtain
fees.
and
the
result
of
that,
coupled
with
justice
o'connor's
test,
is
that
the
marketplace
forces
attorneys
to
weed
out
the
less
worthy
cases
and
to
select
the
strongest
cases.
lastly,
under
different
statutes
and
for
many
years
courts
have
considered
risk
of
non-payment
in
determining
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
the
court
should
affirm
this
long-standing
practice
and
adopt
the
practical
and
workable
approach
suggested
by
justice
o'connor.
thank
you.
