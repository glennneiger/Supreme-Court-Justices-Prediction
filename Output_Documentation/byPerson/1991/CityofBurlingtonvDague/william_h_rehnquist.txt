chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-810,
the
city
of
burlington
v.
dague.
mr.
clapp.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
arguments
for
both
sides
are
pretty
well
set
forth
in
the
various
opinions
for
the
court
in
the
second
delaware
case,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clapp.
mr.
seamon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
about
the
situation
which
certainly
was
more
common
at
the
time
when
i
practiced,
i'll
either
take
it
so
much
an
hour
if
you're
good
for
the
fee,
win
or
lose,
or
else
i'll
take
one-third
or
one-half,
you
know,
not
always
one-half,
of
the
recovery
if
we
win?
how
does
that
fit
into
the
picture?
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
then
when
you
say
a
fee
is
fair
in
the
sense
of
the
$40
fee,
you
mean
it's
fair
by
virtue
of
the
fact
it
was
consented
to,
and
not
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
represented
market?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seamon.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
goldstein,
you
say
there's
no
question
it's
taken
into
account
in
the
legal
marketplace,
but
what
evidence
is
there
before
us
that
it's
taken
into
account
in
a
differential
and
hourly
rate
as
opposed
to
a
percentage
of
recovery?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
glad
you
think
so.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
lawyers
quote
a
higher,
or
simply
their
experience
is
that
they
take,
that
their
percentage
recovery
gives
them
a
higher
hourly
rate?
chief
justice
rehnquist
jenner
and
block
agreed
to
take.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
then
what
was
the
other?
chief
justice
rehnquist
some
of
those
limitations
that
congress
put
in
later
statutes
were
in
response
to
the
emerging
fee
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
congress
said
all
this
where?
chief
justice
rehnquist
not
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
committees
used
this
language
you're
referring
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-810,
burlington
against
dague
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
