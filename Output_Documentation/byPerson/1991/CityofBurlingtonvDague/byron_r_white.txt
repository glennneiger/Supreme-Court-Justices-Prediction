justice
white
how
about
that
it's
contrary
to
the
fee-shifting
statute?
justice
white
shouldn't
you
start
with
that?
justice
white
it
only
provides
for
fees
when
you
win--
justice
white
--not
when
you
lose.
justice
white
and
if
you're
getting
enhanced
when
you
win,
you're
getting
enhanced
and
being
paid
for
when
you
lose.
justice
white
that's
just
a
plain
old
statutory
question,
isn't
it?
justice
white
otherwise
you
wouldn't
be--
justice
white
--and
you
wouldn't
be
being
paid
to
be
here.
justice
white
but
it
nevertheless
was
adopted
by
this
court,
wasn't
it?
[laughter]
justice
white
well,
we
do
do
strange
things.
justice
white
stare
decisis,
as
they
say.
justice
white
but
it
isn't
the
fact
of
contingency,
is
it?
it's
a
question
of
how
difficult
the
issue
is
and
what
kind
of
skill
it
takes
to
win.
justice
white
the
problem
with
that
is
in
cases
where
there
are
no
damages
being
sought
or
awarded.
justice
white
well,
where
only
an
injunction
is
sought,
why,
what
deal
the
lawyer
and
his
client
make
seems
to
me
to
be
irrelevant.
justice
white
mr.
goldstein,
could
i
ask
you,
am
i
right
in
reading
the
court
below
as
not
thinking
that
delaware
valley
ii
was,
should
be
used
as
any
guide
to
resolving
the
fee
issue,
and
then
instead
it
just
relied
on
one
of
its
prior,
one
of
its
prior
authorities
and
certainly
didn't
go
through
the
approach
that
justice
o'connor
suggested?
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
white.
it
relied
on
friends
of
the
earth,
a
second
circuit
authority
which
in
fact
adopted
part
of
the,
prior
to
justice
o'connor's
opinion,
adopted
part
of
that
opinion
or
set
out
what
became
that
opinion.
was
there
any
proof
in
this
case
as
to
what
it
would
take
to
get
a
lawyer
for
this
plaintiff?
justice
white
you
mean
they
just
referred
to
the
market
and
decided
what
it
would
take
to
get
a
lawyer
in
this
case,
rather
than
having
any
kind
of
actual
proof
that
this
plaintiff
tried
to
get
a
lawyer
and
couldn't
find
one,
or
what?
justice
white
the
court
below
didn't
determine
its
fee
based
on
either
the...
either
of
the
opinions
in
delaware
ii.
they
didn't
use
the
standard
of
either
the
opinion
that
i
wrote
or
the
opinion
that
justice
o'connor
wrote.
justice
white
what
claim
of
enhancement
was
presented
to
the
court?
justice
white
were
you
claiming
that
it
was...
a
50
percent
enhancement
really
reflected
what
the
market
in
burlington
was?
justice
white
and
the
court
said
sorry,
that
isn't
what
the
market
requires
in
burlington?
justice
white
how
did
he,
how
does
a
court
go
around
figuring
out
how
to
disagree
with
these
experts
in
the
market?
justice
white
does
it
involve,
doesn't
it
involve
a
court
deciding
what
the
degree
of
risk
is?
if
you're
going
to
enhance
for
risk,
i
suppose
you'd
give
a
different
enhancement
for
a
small
risk
and
a
bigger
one
for
a
larger
risk.
justice
white
is
that
right?
justice
white
i'll
take
it
both
ways.
justice
white
and
do
you
think
that's
proper?
justice
white
i
didn't
think
you
did,
because
you
put
in,
you
asked
for
50
percent,
which
you
thought
reflected
the
market.
justice
white
you
must
have
thought
it
reflected
the
market.
justice
white
50
percent.
i
mean,
a
50
percent
enhancement.
justice
white
well,
you
thought
it
showed
1.5.
justice
white
i
mean
2.0.
justice
white
well,
if
you
thought
it
ought
to
be
done
according
to
justice
o'connor's
opinion,
which
would
have
come
out
with
2.0,
you
should
have
cross-petitioned
for
not
enough
money.
justice
white
--but
they
were
still
saying
a
reasonable
fee
but
no
allowance
for
contingencies.
justice
white
or
will
not
reflect
any
risk.
justice
white
but
even
with
that
limitation
it
still
would
have
been
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
justice
white
well,
it
was
still
reasonable.
justice
white
yes,
under
that
act.
and
of
course
what
congress
meant
by
reasonable
in
one
act,
especially
a
later
one,
shouldn't
be
a
measure
of
what
they
intended
reasonable
to
be
on
an
earlier
act,
i
suppose
you
would
argue,
correctly.
justice
white
so
what
should
we
do?
this
isn't
the
standard
the
lower
court
used.
they
rejected
the
standard
and
moved
to,
and
decided
it
on
another
standard.
should
we
just...
if
we
agree
with
you
shouldn't
we
remand
for
recomputation
of
the
attorney's
fees?
justice
white
i
would
think
if
it's,
i
would
think
the
way
to
go
about
this
compensation
for
risk
would
be
to
pay
the
lawyer
when
he
loses.
he
has
taken...
you
know,
you
want
these
people
to
have
lawyers,
and
if
a
lawyer
is
willing
to
take
this
case,
he,
some
lawyers
are
bound
to
lose,
you
ought
to
pay
them
for
that
rather
than
have
the
defendant
when
he
wins
have
to
pay
for
the
cases
when
you
lose.
