mr.
clapp,
may
i
ask
a
question
to
show
my
ignorance
of
this
whole
area
of
the
law?
where
did
the
term
lodestar
come
from
in
this
context?
justice
stevens
it
always
struck
me
as
a
strange
kind
of
a
term.
justice
stevens
in
computing
the
lodestar,
now
that
we
know
what
it
is,
you
do
take
market
forces
into
account,
do
you?
justice
stevens
what
if
an
economist
could
convince
us,
and
i
probably
couldn't,
that
the
market
is
different
in
a
free
market
when
you're
just
charging
clients
and
you
don't
have
government
mixing
into
the
thing,
the
market
pays
a
little
more
when
there's
a
contingency
involved
than
it
does
when
there's
no
contingency
involved?
justice
stevens
and
then
it
would
indicate
that
the
contingency
factor
would
be
reasonable,
i
guess,
because
within
the
higher--
justice
stevens
--on
the
lode,
because
the
lodestar
assumed
when
it
is
worked
out
that
there
is
a,
that
if
there
has
been
a
contingency
factor,
it
was
taken
into
account
in
computing
the
lodestar?
justice
stevens
mr.
clapp--
justice
stevens
--could
i
test
that
with
you
just
a
moment?
i
know
when
i
was
in
practicing
sometimes
you
take
a
case
and
you
get,
say,
paid,
say,
maybe
then
it
was
$25
or
$30
an
hour,
win,
lose,
or
draw.
but
if
you
were
going
to
take
the
case
and
you
make
a
deal
with
the
client
that
if
i
win
it
you'll
pay
me
$40
an
hour,
instead
of
$30
or
$25.
now
which...
and
that's,
say
all
lawyers,
a
lot
of
lawyers
made
those
same
alternative
offers
to
their
prospective
clients,
$40
if
i
win,
i
get
paid,
i
get
nothing
if
i
lose,
$25,
win,
lose,
or
draw.
which
is
the
right
lodestar
fee
in
that
market,
say
that's
the
evidence?
justice
stevens
it's
a
contract
case.
justice
stevens
no,
it's
the
bargain...
the
client
had
the
choice.
he
could
either
make
the
$40
commitment
or
the
$25,
win,
lose,
or
draw.
and
you
say
the
$25
fee
would
be
the
one
that
would
be
the
market-determined?
justice
stevens
but
the
other
one
is
also.
everybody
in
the
market
has
the
other
alternative
too.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see,
we
have
a
special
market
when
there's
a
fee-shifting
statute?
justice
stevens
that's
right.
you
pay
a
little
more
if
you
get
a
warranty
and
a
guarantee
than
you
do
if
you
don't
when
you
buy
a
car.
justice
stevens
against
the
background
of
what
alternatives
are
available
in
the
market.
justice
stevens
no,
but
i'm
assuming
he
would,
you
try
to
make
him...
you
would
make
the
statutory
fee
be
one
that
would
be
a
duplicate
of
what
would
have
been
negotiated
in
a
free
market.
that's
what
i
was
suggesting.
justice
stevens
well,
how
did
the
$40
figure
get
there
if
it
wasn't
determined
by
market
forces?
i
mean,
do
you
think
just
the
lawyer
just
cooked
it
up
out
of
thin
air?
in
my
hypothetical,
don't
you
have
to
start
from
the
assumption
that
he
thought
that
the
market
would
justify
these
two
alternative
ways
of
computing
a
fee?
justice
stevens
well,
it
did
when
i
was
in
practice.
