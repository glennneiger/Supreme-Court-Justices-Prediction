mr.
michael
b.
clapp
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
district
court,
in
determining
a
reasonable
hourly
fee,
a
reasonable
fee
award
under
federal
fee-shifting
statutes,
may
enhance
that
award
above
the
lodestar
amount
in
order
to
reflect
the
fact
that
plaintiff's
attorneys
have
taken
the
case
on
a
contingent
fee
basis,
thus
assuming
the
risk
of
receiving
no
attorney's
fees
at
all,
and
this
case
the
district
court
denied
a
preliminary
injunction
motion
and
ultimately
issued
an
order
on
the
merits
which
denied
all
of
the
relief
sought
by
the
plaintiff
and
granted
relief
limited
to
the
ratification
of
a
preexisting
state
court
order.
on
that
basis,
when
determining
the
reasonable
attorney's
fees
to
be
awarded
to
the
plaintiffs,
the
district
court
concluded
to
award
the
full
lodestar
amount
and
in
addition
a
contingency
bonus
or
enhancement
to
reflect
the
fact
that
plaintiff's
counsel
had
taken
the
case
on
a
contingency
basis.
the
decision
that
the
enhancement
award
was
in
order
was
based
upon
the
bizarre
conclusions
that
in
the
first
place
the
plaintiff's
loss
of
the
preliminary
injunction
motion
somehow
entitled
plaintiffs
to
be
compensated
at
a
greater
rate,
not
only
with
respect
to
the
effort
expended
with
respect
to
the
preliminary
injunction
motion
and
other
claims
that
were
lost,
but
with
respect
to
all
hours
devoted
to
the
case.
secondly,
the
court
based
its
decision
on
its
determination
that
plaintiff's
attorney
who
brought
and
prosecuted
the
case
with
no
guarantee
of
an
enhancement
was
nevertheless
entitled
to
the
enhancement
award.
this
case,
we
submit,
demonstrates
an
example
of
the
hensley
lodestar
method
of
fee
calculation
run
amuck.
our
response
to
the
precise
issue
presented
to
the
court
is
first,
no
enhancement
for
a,
of
a
lodestar
fee
to
reflect
risk
of
lost
contingency
should
ever
be
granted,
for
the
reason
that
any
such
award
of
an
enhancement
is
necessarily
speculative
and
contrary
to
the
evidence
of
the
market's
response
to
risk
of
loss
assumption
as
demonstrated
by
the
evidence
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
it's
also...
for
that
reason,
contrary--
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
--well,
the
fee-shifting
statute
provides,
of
course,
that
fees
should
be
reasonable,
and
this
court
has
determined
on
several
occasions
that--
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
precisely
the
point
that
we
were
raising
with
respect
to
the
basis
for
this
court's
determination,
that
it
is
absolutely
bizarre--
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
we
would
certainly
contend
that
it
was,
your
honor.
the
respondents,
we
anticipate,
will
argue
that
on
the
basis
of
economic
theory
that
despite
what
the
facts
show
the
enhancement
should
be
available
in
order
to
encourage
the
bringing
of
these
types
of
lawsuits
in
general.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
difficulty
with
the
various
opinions
set
forth
in
the
delaware
case
is
that
both...
that's
a
major
problem,
of
course,
but
i
will
address
my
comments
for
the
moment
to--
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
--otherwise
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
that's
correct.
very
true.
[laughter]
i
would
like
to
address
my
observations,
if
i
could
for
a
moment,
to
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
and
the
dissenting
opinion
in
delaware
valley
ii.
i
would
like
to
preface
those
remarks
by
pointing
out
that
this
court
determined
in
delaware
valley
i,
or
set
forth
in
delaware
valley
i
in
justice
white's
opinion,
that
the
whole
purpose
for
this
court's
selection
of
the
hensley
method
of
fee
calculation
was
to
avoid,
was
precisely
to
avoid
the
sort
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
conclusion
that
enhancement
of
an
otherwise
reasonable
lodestar
fee
presents.
the
difficulty,
it
seems
to
me,
with
both
the
concurring
opinion
and
the
dissenting
opinion
in
delaware
valley
ii
is
that
neither
of
those
opinions
address
the
difficult
issue
that
arises
when
a
court
attempts
to
venture
beyond
its
role
as
a
fact-finder
and
to
begin
enunciating
policy.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
your
honor,
i
understand
that
the
term
lodestar
was
coined
by
the
third
circuit
in
its
early
development
of
the
method
of
fee
calculation
that
refers
to
a
base
of
all
hours
expended
on
a
case,
reasonably
expended
on
a
case,
times
the
reasonable
hourly
rate.
beyond
that,
i
cannot
explain
the
derivation
of
the
term.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
it
struck
me
as
a
strange
term,
too.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
the
term
was
adopted
by
this
court.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
the
method
of--
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
--the
method
that
is
referred
to
by
the
term
that
was
adopted
by
this
court
was
a
modification
of
that
third
circuit
approach
that
had
been
developed
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
my
understanding
of
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
market
determines
what
the
reasonable
hourly
rate
to
be
used
in
calculating
the
fee
is.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
assuming
that
such
evidence
could
be
developed,
then
that
evidence
would
simply
be
evidence
of
what
the
market
rate
is
in
that
particular
market.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
it
would
simply
indicate
that
to
whatever
extent
that
market
compensates
for
contingency,
that
figure
is
already
reflected
in
the,
in
that
market
hourly
rate.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
it
was
taken
into
account
by
the
market
in
determining
what
the
market
rate
was,
and
the
courts
should
be
limited
to
simply
determining
what
that
market
rate
is.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
the
definition
of
the
risk
of
loss
is
complicated,
your
honor,
and
i
would
address
that
question
specifically
by
saying
whether,
or
the
extent
of
the
risk
of
loss
in
a
particular
case
is
a
function
not
only
of
the
complexity
of
the
issues
advanced,
and
to
that
extent
the
plaintiff
controls
that
issue
by
the
extent
of
the
relief
that
is
granted,
or
requested
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
yes,
sir,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
there
certainly
is,
your
honor.
there
is
a
state
law
claim
remaining
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
for
$1
million.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
well,
assuming,
your
honor,
that
a
rational
support
for
fee
enhancement,
lodestar
fee
enhancement,
could
be
constructed,
i
think
amicus,
the
american
bar
association
and
this
court
in
other
occasions
has
recognized
that
a
fee
arrangement
between
plaintiff
and
their
counsel
may
have
the
effect
of
reducing
whatever
risk
would
otherwise
be
inherent
in
a
particular
case.
thus
in
this
case,
as
we
understand
plaintiff's
arrangement
with
their
attorney,
if
the
plaintiffs
are
successful
in
establishing
a
right
to
a
fee
award
in
this
case,
that
will
be
the
limit
of
the
compensation
that
they
receive.
if
they
are
not,
plaintiffs
will
still
be
compensated
on
a
percentage
fee
basis
for
any
work
that
is
performed
in
this
case,
assuming
that
they
are
successful
in
establishing
their
state
related
claims
to
damages.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
we
think
not,
your
honor.
the
market
rate
which
should
be
used
in
calculating
the
lodestar
is
not
a
reflection
of
what
a
particular
supplier
in
the
market
hopes
to
obtain.
it
should
be,
and
we
contend
under
the
hensley
lodestar
method,
should
reflect
how
the
market
compensates
for
those
services,
not,
to
repeat,
what
a
particular
attorney
hopes
to
receive.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
then
the
market
rate
in
that
particular
case
would
reflect
the--
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
--the
$50
an
hour
increase.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
to
the
extent
that
the
court
becomes
involved
in
trying
to
parse
the
elements
that
a
particular
market
rate
reflects,
my
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
would
be
that
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
to
get
involved
in
that
parsing.
the
market
reflects
whatever
considerations
the
market
considers
in
fixing
a
prevailing
market
rate.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
the
question
before
a
court
in
any
fee-fixing
case,
fee-shifting
case,
is
what
is
the
appropriate
market
rate
to
use.
the
evidence
that
the
court
considers
to
be
relevant
with
respect
to
that
particular
market's
compensation
rate
might
include
how
much
attorneys
generally
charge
for
the
provision
of
services.
the
precise
question
would
be
how
does
the
market
compensate
attorneys
providing
similar
services
and
having
similar
skills.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
i
think
there
is
a
basic
distinction
that
the
lodestar
method
adopted
by
this
court
contemplates.
that
is
in
effect
there
is
no
market
that
measures
risk
of
loss
contingency
compensation
for
these
types
of
cases
because
the
market
is
in
fact
determined
by
the
courts
and
not
by
market
forces.
there
is
no
relevant
market
to
look
to
to
attempt
to
measure
any
difference
in
compensation
for
risk
of
loss
in
these
particular
types
of
cases
as
opposed
to
the
market
in
general.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
yes.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
if
that's
the
evidence,
your
honor,
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
$40
fee
is
irrelevant
to
this
particular
market.
let
me
explain
very
briefly
why.
that
$40
fee
is
negotiated
between
the
lawyer
and
his
client.
that
$40
fee
typically
in
a
tort
contingency
case--
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
--reflects
cross-subsidation
of
other
efforts
by
that
attorney
representing
similar
plaintiffs.
and
the
point
finally,
mr.
justice
stevens,
is
that
you
simply
could
not,
no
court
could
determine
how
that
particular
market
compensated
for
risk.
that
$40
that
you're
quoting
represents
that
particular
attorney's
hope
with
respect
to
a
fee
recovery.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
but
it's
a
different
market
from
fee-shifting
statutes
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
indicated.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
no,
we
have
the
market...
whether
we're
talking
about
a
market
for
legal
services
or
a
market
for
automobiles,
your
honor,
reflects
different
subclasses,
and
fees
that
are
negotiated--
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
--well,
but
fees
that
are
determined
with
respect,
or
by
negotiation
between
a
party
and
his
attorney--
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
--but
that...
understand,
your
honor,
that
in
these
sorts
of
cases,
in
fee-shifting
cases,
the
client
is
going
to
have
no
interest
in
limiting
his
attorney's
compensation
where
the
case
is
on
a
contingency
basis,
because
he's
not
going
to
pay
it
anyway.
it's
going
to
be
someone
else
who
will
pay
that
fee.
he
might
as
well
agree
to
a
rate
of,
in
your
example,
$200
an
hour.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
and
my
response
to
that
is,
your
honor,
if
the
free
market
doesn't
reflect
that
hourly
rate
to
the
extent
the
courts
intervene--
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
--well,
the
market
might
justify
that--
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
--your
honor,
but
it
would
not
be
the
result
of
free
market
operation.
it
would
be
the
result
of
negotiations
between
that
party
and
his
client.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
it's
not
necessary
to
make
that
assumption.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
well,
and
my
response
to
that
should
be,
your
honor,
is
that
if
in
fact
the
market
rates
are
insufficient
to
attract
counsel,
then
congress
should
make
decisions
about
what
steps
it
wants
to
take
to
enforce
its
policy.
it
shouldn't
be
the
courts--
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
--congress
authorized
the
court
to
award
a
reasonable
fee.
it
did
not,
it
seems
to
me
nothing
in
the
statutes
or
the
legislative
history
authorizes
the
courts
to
legislate,
make
legislative
decisions
about
what
that
reasonable
fee
ought
to
be.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
that's
precisely
my
point.
mr.
michael
b.
clapp
in
essence
that's
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
any
other
solution
necessarily
gets
the
court
involved
in
those
sorts
of
policy
decisions.
to
what
extent
should
our
system
encourage
the
bringing
of
these
sorts
of
cases?
those
are
policy
decisions
that
congress
should
make
and
that
this
court
is
frankly
not
equipped
to
make.
thank
you
very
much.
