justice
souter
but
your
argument
assumes
that
if
the
client
had
hung
tough
and
said
no,
$25
is
as
high
as
i'm
going
to
go,
he
would
have
taken
the
case
anyway
on
a
contingent
fee.
if
the
client
had
said,
you
know,
$25
only
if
you
win,
that
he
would
have
taken
the
case
anyway.
and
that's...
i
mean,
i
don't
think
we
can
make
that
assumption,
can
we,
if
we
are
fact-finders?
justice
souter
maybe
what
you're
saying
is
go
ahead
and
make
that
assumption
and
see
what
happens,
and
if
it
turns
out
that
nobody
takes
these
cases,
then
maybe
you'd
better
modify
your
assumption.
but
if
you
can,
if
you
the
court
can
hang
tough
as
a
fact-finder
and
still
get
the
lawyers,
that's
what
you
ought
to
do.
justice
souter
well,
isn't
the
problem
with
that
response
that
congress,
i
thought,
gave
the
courts
the
responsibility
for
determining
a
rate
that
would
in
fact
attract?
justice
souter
no,
but
i
thought
you
were
telling
me
that
if
we
took
the
hang
tough
position
as
fact-finders
and
said
look,
we're
going
to
latch
onto
the
$25
figure
and
if
it
works,
fine,
that's
the
figure
we'll
use
for
the
future,
maybe
adjusted
for
inflation.
if
it
doesn't
work
we'll
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
say
maybe
we'd
better
go
up
to
40.
and
i
thought
your
response
was
no,
no,
it's
up
to
congress
whether
to
decide
to
go
up
to
40.
justice
souter
well,
i
think
you're
saying,
then,
that
it
is
not
our's,
it
is
not
the
court's
responsibility
to
determine
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
is
necessary
to
attract
counsel
to
take
these
cases.
you're
saying
if
the
court
comes
up
with
a
figure
that
doesn't
attract
them,
too
bad,
the
court's
job
is
done.
look
to
congress.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
souter
well,
doesn't
that
simply
mean
that
you've
got
to
look
for
your
examples
outside
the
sphere
of
these
kinds
of
cases?
justice
souter
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
$40
is
not
the
market
figure,
assuming
that
that
was
not
a
case
of
this
sort,
assuming
we're
outside
this
sphere
of
cases.
the
$40
is
still
the
market
figure,
isn't
it?
