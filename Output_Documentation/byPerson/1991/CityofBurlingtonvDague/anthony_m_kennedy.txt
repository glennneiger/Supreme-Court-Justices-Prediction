justice

assume
that
we
say
that
contingent
fees
are
inappropriate
and
that
the
court
is
concluding
a
lodestar
fee
and
the
court
hears
expert
witnesses
or
considers
an
affidavit,
and
the
testimony
is
that
in
cases
of
this
kind
since
recovery
is
uncertain
the
hourly
rate
is
generally
$50
an
hour
higher
than
other
hourly
rates.
should
that
be
included
in
the
lodestar
amount?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
if
the
testimony
is
that
this
is
how
the
market
compensates
for
it?
justice
kennedy
the
$50
an
hour
increase?
justice
kennedy
well
then
are
we
engaged
in
a
circular
enterprise
no
matter
which
way
we
rule?
justice
kennedy
well,
should
the
market
be
defined
as
the
market
for
attorney's
fees
generally
and
not
just
for
fees
of
cases
of
this
type,
so
that
if
you
were
the
trial
judge
you'd
ask
a
defense
firm
what
they
charge
an
insurance
company
by
the
hour
and
use
that
as
the
rate?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
there's
no
objection
to
the
trial
court
taking
into
account
the
discrete
market
which
consists
of
those
who
undertake
representation
in
cases
of
this
type,
and
if
that
discrete
market
includes
an
enhanced
hourly
rate
for
the
contingency
factor
then
it
seems
to
me
it
makes
no
difference
what
we
rule
in
this
case.
we
might
as
well
rule
against
you
and
have
it
all
out
in
the
open.
justice
kennedy
are
you
saying
the
difficulty
of
the
case
is
irrelevant
in
computing
this
magnificent
certitude
that
we
call
the
lodestar?
justice
kennedy
well,
should
trial
judges
be
instructed
that
they
may
not
take
into
account
the
difficulty
of
the
case
in
setting
the
fee?
justice
kennedy
what
about
the
probable
merits
of
the
case,
the
probability
of
success?
justice
kennedy
i
take
it
most
of
the
circuits
are
in
disagreement
with
that
proposition
and
most
of
the
circuits
do
include
probability
or
likelihood
of
success
in
assessing
the
lodestar
amount?
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
