justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
do
you
say
the
last
sentence
could
not
be
construed
as
a
waiver,
at
least
as
to
civil
penalties
arising
under
federal
law?
the
last
sentence
of
what,
justice
o'connor?
of
the
same
section
that
we're
looking
at,
let
me
see...
it's
the
section
313
of
the
clean
water
act,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
does.
this
might
extend
the
waiver
to
federal
penalties.
what
are
the
federal
penalties
that
are
available?
is
section
1319
the
only
section
providing
for
federal
penalties?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then
what
does
federal
penalty
refer
to
in
this
sentence
we
were
just
examining?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you...
do
you
agree
that
the
only
penalties
provided
in
federal
law
right
now
are
those
in
1319?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
1319
contemplates
that
those
are,
are
penalties
that
can
be
sought
by
a
suit
brought
by
epa,
by
the
administrator.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
relying
on
the
provisions
of
1323,
the
federal
facilities
pollution
control
statute
for
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
but
under
the
citizens
suit
provision,
do
you...
do
you
rely
on
that
to
give
authority
for
waiver
of
federal
sovereign
immunity
for
civil
sanctions
imposed
by
state
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
thought
1323
did
not
waive
federal
sovereign
immunity
for
state
law
sanctions,
where
would
that
leave
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
suit,
nevertheless,
covers
federal
sanctions
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
deal
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
1365.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
it
under
that...
it
did
not
deal
with
that
section
at
all?
