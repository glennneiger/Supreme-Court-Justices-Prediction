mr.
feldman,
before
you
leave
1365...
if
it's
possible
to
leave
it...
my
understanding
is
that
these
fines
are
paid
to
the
united
states
government
under
this
section.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that...
does
that
present
a
case
or
controversy,
for
federal
courts
to
sit
and
allocate
money
from
one
federal
account
to
another?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
to
the
enforcement,
perhaps.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
just
as
to
the
penalty
part--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i'm
not
sure
if
there
are
cases
where
there's
a
case
or
controversy
as
to
part
of
the
relief,
but
not
as
to
the
other
part
of
the
relief.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
quite
questionable
here
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
as
to
the
fine
that's
being
paid
from
one
part
of
the
federal
treasury
to
the
other.
