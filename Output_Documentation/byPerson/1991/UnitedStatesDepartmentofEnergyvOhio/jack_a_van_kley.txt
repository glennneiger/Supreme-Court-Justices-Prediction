mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
this
case
turns
on
three
words
scattered
over
the
course
of
four
statutory
sections.
and
we
would
like
to
very
briefly
spend
a
little
bit
of
time
beginning
with
the
citizens
suit
provisions
which,
of
course,
turns
on
the
word
person.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
all
right,
your
honor.
the
particular
statutory
term
that
i'm
referring
to
is
found
in
the
citizens
suit
provision,
which
is
the
same
provision
that
we
have
been
discussing
with
mr.
feldman.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
same
operative
language
also
appears
in
rcra's
citizens
suit
provision,
which
is
42
usc
6961.
and
that
would
also
be
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition...
well,
actually,
actually
i
think
that
we're
better
off
looking
at
the
department
of
energy
cross-petition
on
that
one,
because
i
think
there
was
an
error
in
the
printing
on
that
particular
one,
so
we
believe
the
cross-petition
or...
no,
it's--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--right,
it...
i'm
sorry,
i
misstated,
your
honor.
it's
42
usc
6972.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
okay,
it's
on
their
brief.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
it's
correct
in
their
brief,
yes.
so
those
are
the
two
provisions
that
i'd
like
to
dwell
on
just
briefly
here.
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
discussion
that
mr.
feldman
and
justice
stevens
had
at
the
beginning
of
that
dialogue
concerning
the
phrase
arising
under
federal
law,
and
how
that
relates
to
the
definition
of
person
in
the
citizens
suit
provision.
under
the
department's
interpretation,
not
only
can
citizens
not
file
a
suit
for
civil
penalties
against
the
federal
government,
but
even
epa
could
not
file
a
lawsuit
for
civil
penalties
against
the
federal
government.
which
means
that
no
one
can
file
a
civil
penalty
action
against
the
federal
government
under
federal
law,
under
the
department's
interpretation.
and
that
negates
the
operation,
according
to
the
department...
of
the
phrase,
civil
penalties
arising
under
federal
law.
now,
civil
penalties--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--yes,
your
honor...
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
be
1319,
incorporated
by
reference
into
the
citizens
suit
provision.
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
yes,
your
honor,
and
also
by
a
citizen.
in
fact,
if
an
ordinary
citizen
other
than
a
state
were
to
file
under
the
citizens
suit
provision,
that
citizen
would
also
be
applying
the
standards
in
1319.
and
it's
incorporated
into
reference...
by
reference
into
the
citizens
suit
provision.
and
that's
where
all
citizens
suits
draw
their
penalty
provisions
from.
so
by
the
operation
of
that
citizens
suit
provision,
the
civil
penalties
against
the
united
states
are
not
limited
to
1319
as
enforced
by
the
administrator.
we
would
also
note
that--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
no,
i
would
not
agree
with
that.
the
states
can
be
sued,
even
despite
the--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--no,
and
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
court
recently
decided
another
case
in
the
superfund
area
where
it
interpreted
exactly
that
type
of
phrase,
and
decided
that
the
eleventh
immunity
was
waived.
that
was
the
union
gas
case,
your
honor.
so
it
does
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
states
as
well
as
the
federal
government.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
um--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--i'm
not
really
sure,
your
honor,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
so--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--well--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--well,
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
ambiguous.
and
we
do
not
believe
they're
self-contradictory,
either.
we
think
that
anyone
can
think
of
arguments
to
propose
a
secondary
definition
of
any
statutory
term,
if
a
person
creates
enough
ambiguity
by
exercising
ingenuity.
and
there
are
many
cases
in
the
courts
where
people
have
tried
to
stretch
the
meaning
of
words.
but
if
we
look
at
the
normal
meaning
of
these
words,
it
is
not
ambiguous.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
yes,
your
honor.
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
is
waived
with
respect
to
all
sanctions.
sanctions
would
include
civil
penalties
under
the
normal
meaning
of
that
word.
in
fact,
even
this
court,
in
some
of
the
cases
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
has
used
the
word
sanctions
to
refer
to
civil
penalties,
and
criminal
penalties,
and
other
types
of
penalties.
there's
a
limitation
sentence
below
that
which
is
the
arising-under
clause,
which
limits
those
sanctions
to
those
civil
penalties
arising
under
federal
law.
and
that
is
simply
the
way
the
statute
works,
your
honor.
now,
civil
penalties
ordinarily
is
not
a
term
used
to
describe
contempt
sanctions.
in
fact,
congres
has
been
using
the
phrase
sanctions
to
enforce
injunctive
relief
in
these
waivers
to
express
their
desire
to
waive
immunity
for
contempt
sanctions.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
your
honor,
that
is
true
with
respect
to
the
civil
penalties
assessed
pursuant
to
the
state
program.
we
rely
solely
on
1323.
with
regard
to
the
citizens
suit
penalties,
we
rely
both
on
1323
and
the
citizens
suit
provision.
and--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--we
believe
that
the
specific
waiver
in
the
citizens
suit
provision
is
enough.
however,
there
is
also
another
provision
of
waiver
in
1323
which
works
just
as
well,
with
respect
to
the
clean
water
act.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
that
would
leave
us
with
the
citizens
suit
provisions
under
federal
law.
if
the
court
decided
that
particular...
in
that
particular
fashion,
the
state
of
ohio
would
not
be
able
to
enforce
its
civil
penalties
under
its
implementation
of
the
federal
program.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
it
did
with
respect
to
the
rcra
citizens
suit
provision,
but
not--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--the
clean
water
act,
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
that's
correct.
it
did
not
need
to
reach
that
section
because
the
stipulation
of
penalty
provides
that
the
penalty
payments
will
be
made
under
state
law,
if
the
court
finds
a
state
law
waiver,
and
goes
to
the
federal
citizens
suit
penalties
only
if
the
court
fails
to
find
a
waiver
under
state
law.
so
as
a
result,
the
sixth
circuit
did
not
need
to
reach
the
citizens
suit
issue
with
respect
to
the
clean
water
act.
now--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do
agree.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
no,
your
honor.
the
main
purpose
of
a
civil
penalty
is
its
deterrent
effect.
the
deterrent
effect
from
such
a
penalty
comes
from
twofold...
first
of
all,
under
some
types
of
actions,
the
money
would
be
taken
out
of
the
doe
accounts,
out
of
the
doe
funds,
and
paid
to
another
account
that
doe
cannot
draw
on.
in
other
words,
doe
loses
the
use
of
the
money
it
has
strived
so
carefully
to
get
from
congress.
secondly,
perhaps
the
most
important
deterrent
from
a
civil
penalty
is
the
public
stigma,
if
you
will,
that
is
attached
to
paying
a
penalty
for
violating
the
law.
and,
in
fact,
with
respect
to
federal
agencies,
that
is
the
most
effective
deterrent.
a
federal
agency
does
not
want
to
draw
the
attention
of
congress
and
the
public
to
it,
and
basically--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--no,
there
is
no
indication
either
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
in
which
congress
discussed
where
the
money
is
going
to
go.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--oh,
it
does,
your
honor.
it
makes
a
dramatic
difference.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
from
the
standpoint
of
the
stigma
of
being
penalized.
it
does,
indeed,
make
a
very
big
difference.
because
the
fact
that
they've
paid
this
penalty
calls
congress'
attention,
including
in
the
appropriation
process,
where
they
might
have
to
re-fund
the
money
drawn
by
that
penalty,
or
re-fund
the
money
drawn
from
the
judgment
fund,
that
very
definitely
calls
attention
to
the
public
agency...
to
the
federal
agency
by
the
public
and
by
congress.
in
fact,
your
honor,
we
have
had
cases
where
federal
agencies
have
been
willing
to
pay
us
money
simply
if
they
don't
call
it
a
civil
penalty,
because
of
the
embarrassment
factor.
and,
in
fact,
your
honor,
we
also
have
to
go
back
to
can
congress's
statements
about
civil
penalties
in
the
1972
clean
water
act,
where
congress
acknowledged
that
although
injunctive
relief
was
available,
the
act
was
not
working
in
part
because
there
were
no
penalties
for
noncompliance.
and
in
light
of
that
overriding
purpose
from
congress,
even
congress
realized
that
injunctive
relief
alone
was
not
adequate
to
do
the
job.
and
that
is
true
with
federal
agencies
as
well.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
they're
including
only
contempt
sanctions
for
state
and
local
courts
in
that
particular
section.
there
are
other
contempt
sanctions--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--not
with
respect
to
contempt
sanctions
under
federal
law,
your
honor.
the
contempt
sanctions
under
federal
law--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--no,
your
honor.
the
sanctions
that
are
in
the
latter
half
of
the
sentence
which
you've
been
referring
to--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
correct.
the
words
used
there
do
not
include
federal
contempt
sanctions.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
those
are
covered
by
the
earlier
part
of
the
section,
however.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
well,
the
way
the
sentence
is
structured,
your
honor,
there
is
no
alternative
meaning.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
no,
the--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--no,
your
honor,
perhaps
i--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--no,
your
honor,
the
way
the
sentence
is
structured,
it
states
first
that
the
federal
government
is
subject
to
all
civil
penalties
rising
under
federal
law.
and
then
it
also
says--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
okay,
i
misstated,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
yes,
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
second
part
of
the
sentence,
paraphrased,
means
the
federal
government
shall
be
liable
for
sanctions
imposed
by
state
and
local
courts.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not.
because
it...
they
are
donated
sanctions,
sanctions.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
the
noun,
your
honor,
is
the
word--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--the...
the
sentence
that
we've
been
describing,
i
think,
can
be,
can
be
explained
as
to
its
intent
by
looking
at
the...
how
the
state
programs,
the
state
civil
penalty
programs
work.
we've
developed
in
our
brief
that
state
law
programs
operate
in
lieu
of
and
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government
with
respect
to
the
civil
penalties
that
are
assessed
under
those
programs.
notably,
the
united
states
epa
refers
to
enforcement
mechanisms
such
as
civil
penalties
as
the
requirements
of
state
programs.
but
it
does
not
refer
to
state
contempt
sanctions
as
part
of
that
program.
so
that
is
why
it
was
necessary
in
the
second
part
of
that
sentence
to
separately
refer
to
the
state
and
local
court
contempt
sanctions.
one
thing
that
has
to
be
emphasized
with
respect
to
the
state
law
programs
is
that
epa
has
basically
been
told
to
keep
its
hands
off
of
enforcement,
as
long
as
the
state
is
implementing
its
approved
program.
now,
in
fact,
usepa
has
to
give
30
days
notice
before
the
state,
and
allow
the
state
to
enforce...
take
advantage
of
the
situation
and
try
to
enforce
first,
before
the
federal
government
can
even
act.
and
the
congress
has
made
it
very
clear
that
usepa's
enforcement
actions
to
get
civil
penalties
and
other
enforcement
are
to
be
the
unusual
exception;
that
the
states
are
primarily
entrusted
with
the
function
of
enforcing
this
statute.
therefore,
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
try
to
limit
the
statement
made
in
this
section
to
only
those
civil
penalties
that
have
been
assessed
pursuant
to
the
citizens
suit
provision.
there
will
be
very
little
enforcement
at
all
if
that
occurs.
and,
in
fact,
if
the
state
does
not
enforce,
that
is
grounds
for
usepa
to
revoke
its
program.
so
the
option
is
not
even
left
open
for
the
state
to
allow
epa
to
take
all
the
enforcement
against
the
many
federal
facilities
that
exist
in
this
country.
the
way
the
congress
has
set
this
statute
up
precludes
that
interpretation.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
if
they
are
part
of
the
federally
approved
program
that
acts
in
lieu
of
usepa's
program,
that
is
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
it
is
state
law
that
implements
the
federal
program.
that
is
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
that's
correct,
your
honor.
yes,
the
phrase,
arising
under,
taking
its
normal
textual
meaning,
refers
to
originate
or
spring
out
of,
result
from.
and
even
though
these...
even
though
these
penalties
have
been
enacted
in
the
state
law,
that
state
law
is
passed
directly
as
a
response
to
the
federal
clean
water
act
to
implement
that
program
in
response
to
that
federal
clean
water
act.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
that
depends
on
how
far
this
court
goes
with
respect
to
its
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
that
is
thinkable
only
if
the
court
draws
on
1331
case
law
for
its
decision.
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
even
this
court,
in
the
verlinden
case,
for
example,
has
acknowledged
that
the
phrase
arising
under
means
different
things
in
different
statutes,
depending
on
the
purpose
and
intent
of
that
statute.
for
example,
the
arising
under
clause
in
article
iii
of
the
constitution
has
been
interpreted
differently
than
the
1331
arising
under
clause.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
exactly
right,
your
honor.
thus--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--right,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
no,
your
honor.
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
different
purpose
of
the
arising
under
clause
in
the
clean
water
act.
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it
has
to
be
interpreted
in
the
same
fashion.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
your
honor,
the
department
of
energy
tries
to
use
case
law
from
1331
by
analogy
to
interpret
the
arising
under
clause--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--no,
we
rely
on
the
citizens
suit
provision
for
federal
law,
for
federal
penalties.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
no,
the
difference
is
simply
alternative
forms
of
relief.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
that's
correct,
your
honor,
several
independent
grounds,
in
the
alternative.
in
fact,
we...
the
stipulation
of
settlement
did
not
assess
penalties
under
federal
law
unless
we
could
not
get
them
under
state
law.
so
we
did
not
try
to
collect
twice.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
yes,
there...
the
only
difference,
your
honor,
is
where
the
money
goes,
whether
the
money
goes
to
the
state
treasury
or
the
federal
government.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
there's
two
reasons.
that's
one
reason,
because
we
think
the
deterrence
is
more
effective
if
the
money
goes
to
state
law,
state
court.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
well,
your
honor,
actually,
ah,
there's
a
lot
easier
ways
to
earn
$250,000
than
to
file
a
suit
like
this.
we
definitely
do
not
bring
these
suits
as
fundraising
mechanisms.
[laughter]
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
yeah,
and
the
second
reason--
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
--either
way,
your
honor,
it
is
punishment.
we
think
the
punishment's
greater
under
state
law,
frankly.
but
we
believe
there
is
punishment
both
ways.
and
certainly...
certainly
we
believe
that's
a
laudable
purpose
and
that
deterrent
is
the
only
way
to
enforce
these
statutes.
it's
the
only
way
these
statutes
are
going
to
work.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
no,
they're
lower,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
they're
lower.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
yes.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
they
could
be
higher
as
long
as
they
are
consistent
with
federal
law.
because
usepa
approves
those
penalties.
mr.
jack
a.
van
kley
and,
in
fact,
that's
one
more
reason
why
we
believe
that
they
do
arise
under
federal
law,
is
because
they
are
part
of
a
program
which
usepa
has
labelled
requirements
of
the
state
enforcement
programs.
and
they
are
approved
as
part
of
the
program.
and
they
operate
in
lieu
of
federal
law.
and
as
i
mentioned
before,
given
the
fact
that
usepa
is
not
supposed
to
be
enforcing
the
statute
unless
the
state
falls
down,
it
is
much
more
likely
that
the
federal
government
wanted
the
state
to
take
the
lead
against
the
federal
agencies.
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
and
quickly
distinguish
the
1331
case
law,
although
as
i
mentioned
before,
we
do
not
rely
on
this
case
law.
we
believe
that
1331
arising
under
case
law
should
not
be
used
to
interpret
arising
under
in
the
clean
water
act
because
of
the
different
purposes
of
those
statutes.
however,
under
the
machinists
case,
the
department
of
energy
has
made
the
argument
that
it
is
state
law
that...
in
our
case
it
is
state
law
that
is
providing
the
penalties,
and
therefore,
even
under
1331
it
can't
arise
under
federal
law.
well,
machinists
tells
us
differently.
because
in
that
case,
it
was
a
private
contract,
implementing
the
purposes
of
federal
law
that
was
deemed
to
be
arising
under
federal
law.
so
the
fact
that
the
penalty
actually
is
passed
as
a
state
law,
does
not...
even
under
federal
question
jurisdiction...
detract
from
the
fact
that
it
arises
under
federal
law.
just
one
quick
point
about
the
administrator
being
sued
under
the
clean
water
act
citizens
suit
provisions
that
i'd
like
to
respond
to.
the
administrator
can
be
sued
under
that
section
if,
for
example,
an
epa
building
would
pollute
the
environment.
and
it
does
make
sense
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
epa,
indeed,
can
be
a
federal
agency
violating
the
law
just
like
any
other
agency.
epa
has
to
obey
the
law
as
well.
with
respect
to
the
ault
case,
we
believe
that
the
case
is
dramatically
different
than
the
one
here.
although
the
waiver
in
the
statutory
text
was
extremely
broad
in
that
case,
the
statutory
text
allowed
the
president
to
pass
an
order...
enact
an
order
which
limited
the
scope
of
that
general
waiver.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
that
case.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
