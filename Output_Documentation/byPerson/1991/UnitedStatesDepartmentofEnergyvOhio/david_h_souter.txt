justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
van
kley,
i
understood
you
to
say
a
moment
ago
that
the
term
civil
penalties
is
not
normally
used
to
include
contempt
sanctions
and
so
on.
isn't
that,
however,
exactly
the
sense
in
which
it's
used
in
1323,
because
the
phrase
that
we're
concerned
with
here,
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
only
for
those
civil
penalties
arising
under
federal
law
or
imposed
by
a
state
or
federal
court
to
enforce
an
order
of
the
process
of
such
court,
clearly,
when
they
speak
of
civil
penalty,
they
are
including
a
contempt
sanction
within
that
term,
as
used
here.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
the
section
i
understood
you
to
be
relying
on
a
moment
ago.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i...
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
argument.
i
thought
your
argument
was,
in
effect,
that
civil
penalties
for
which
the
united
states
would
be
liable
would...
is
a
term
that
simply
would
not
normally
be
used
to
refer
to
a
contempt
sanction,
and
hence,
it
was
more
probable
that
it
referred
to
something
other
than
a
contempt
sanction.
and
my
only
point
is
here,
as
the
term
is
used
here,
it
clearly
does
include
a
contempt
sanction
if
it's
imposed
by
a
state
court.
and
therefore,
we
have
to
say
that
the
term
as
used
here
does
include
contempt
sanctions,
which
therefore
weakens
your
argument
that
it
must
refer
to
something
else
when
it's
referring
to
a
civil
penalty
paid
by
the
u.s.
isn't
that
a
fair
response
to
what
you
said?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
your
entire...
i
apologize
for
interrupting
you.
you're
entirely
right
about
half
the
sentence.
but
the
term
is
used
in
both
the
earlier
reference
and
the
later
reference.
and
my
only
point
is
the
term
has
to
include,
as
it
is
used
there,
a
contempt
sanction.
and
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
are,
are
you...
are
you,
in
effect
saying
that
the
term
civil
penalties
is
not
also
modified...
is
not
modified
not
only
by...
start
that
again.
are
you
saying
that
the
term
civil
penalties
is
modified
by,
arising
under
federal
law,
but
is
not
modified
by,
imposed
by
a
state
or
local
court
to
enforce
an
order?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
very
strange
reading.
that's
a
very
strange
reading
of
that
sentence.
well,
what
is
the
alternative
meaning?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
could
you
then
have
simply
excised
from
the
sentence
the
phrase,
arising
under
federal
law,
and
simply
say
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
only
for
those...
strike
that.
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
only
for,
imposed
by
a
state
or
local
court?
that's
the
implication
of
what
you're
saying.
and
that
would
make
no
sense
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
got
to
be...
it's
got
to
refer
to,
to
both
of
those...
both
of
those
modifiers
have
got
to
refer
to
penalties.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
those
sanctions
are
described,
are
denominated
civil
penalties.
justice
david
h.
souter
we'll
have
to
agree
to
disagree.
i
seem
to
insist
on
finding
the
need
for
a
noun
somewhere,
and
you
don't.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
not
promising
that
you
won't
be
back.
[laughter]
we
don't
know
what
some
other
solicitor
general
will
say
about
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
each
of
these
cases
comes
to
us
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
cases
grew
out
of
ohio
suit
alleging
that
in
operating
a
nuclear
fuel
processing
plant
located
in
ohio,
the
department
of
energy
had
violated
the
clean
water
act
and
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
as
well
as
state
environmental
laws.
the
united
states
concedes
that
when
and
if
it
is
found
liable
under
either
of
those
federal
statutes,
it
is
liable
for
coercive
fines
imposed
prospectively
to
induce
it
to
comply
with
the
orders
directing
it
to
refrain
from
statutory
violations
in
the
future.
now,
the
issue
before
us,
however,
is
whether
either
of
the
federal
statutes
also
waves
the
federal
government's
sovereign
immunity
from
liability
for
punitive
fines
penalizing
past
failures
to
comply
with
federal
and
state
environmental
laws.
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
both
statutes
waive
federal
immunity
from
such
punitive
fines.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
and
hold
that
neither
the
clean
water
act
nor
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
waives
federal
sovereign
immunity
from
liability
for
such
punitive
fines.
the
arguments
that
the
statutes
do
waive
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
from
those
fines
are
directed
to
two
sections
in
each
statute,
its
provision
for
citizen
suits
and
its
section
dealing
specifically
with
federal
facilities.
the
citizen
suit
sections
of
both
the
clean
water
act
and
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
or
rcra
authorize
suits
against
the
united
states
and
empower
courts
to
impose
civil
penalties
in
accordance
with
the
civil
penalty
sections
of
the
respective
statutes.
because
however,
those
civil
penalty
sections
do
not
provide
for
any
fines
against
the
united
states,
the
citizen
suit
sections
which
incorporate
them
do
not
waive
federal
sovereign
immunity
from
punitive
fines.
the
section
of
the
clean
water
act
requiring
federal
facilities
to
comply
with
federal
and
state
water
pollution
likewise
fails
to
waive
the
government's
immunity
from
punitive
fines.
in
light
of
our
rule,
construing
such
waivers
narrowly,
that
section's
provision
subjecting
the
united
states
to
"process
and
sanctions"
is
too
uncertain
to
permit
the
conclusion
that
it
waived
federal
immunity
from
punitive
as
well
as
coercive
fines
and
textual
indicators
suggest
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
a
waiver
broad
enough
to
cover
the
punitive
fines.
the
analogous
section
in
rcra
also
fails
to
provide
the
waiver
ohio
seeks.
like
its
counterpart
in
the
clean
water
act,
this
section
waives
federal
immunity
from
sanctions
but
the
context
of
the
waiver
makes
it
clear
that
it
is
not
intended
to
extend
the
punitive
fines
designed
to
punish
past
noncompliance.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
blackmun
and
justice
stevens
have
joined.
