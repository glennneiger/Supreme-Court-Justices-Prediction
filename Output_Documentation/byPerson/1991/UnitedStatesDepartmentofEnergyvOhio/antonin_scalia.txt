justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe...
maybe
when
congress
wrote
this,
the
first
half
of
the
sentence
they
just
didn't...
didn't
advert
to
whether
there
were
any
civil
penalties
arising
under
federal
law.
or
they
thought
they
might
enact
some
in
the
future.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
were
willing
to
have
the
federal
government
liable
for
any
penalties
arising
under
federal
law,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
were
willing
to
have
the
federal
government
liable
for
any
penalties
arising
under
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
these
are
state
statutes
here
that
we're
talking
about,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
state
penalties.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there's
nothing
in
this
sentence
that
says
that
they
shall
be
liable
for
penalties
under
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
that
the
congress
might
have
though
there...
there
were
some
others,
and
didn't
want
to
search
the
statute
books
to
make
sure
there
were,
and
said
if
there
are
any...
if
there
are
any,
we're
perfectly
willing
to
make
the
federal
government
liable
for
it.
but
that
doesn't
mean
we're
willing
to
make
the
federal
government
liable
to
whatever
the
states
want
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
1319(d)?
it
isn't
in
your
appendix.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
somewhere
around
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
where
is
person
defined
to
exclude
the
united
states,
as
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
appropriate
is
the
key
word.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
case
close
to
this.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
the
what
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
wonderful
to
know
that
congress
can
draft
with
such
subtlety.
that
is
really
a
very,
subtle
point.
it's
not
sanctions
used
alone,
but
it's
sanctions
with
process
and
sanctions.
especially
when
congress...
i
thought
congress
got
a
little
upset
about
some
decisions
and
wanted
to
make
sure
the
united
states
got
hooked
to
obey
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm...
don't
we
have
cases
captioned
the
united
states
v.
interstate
commerce
commission?
i
mean,
we've
had
the
federal
government
suing
itself
up
here
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
not
be
right,
but
we've
done
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--right...
that's
on
5(a)
of
the
government's
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
your
contention
is
that
this
provision
waives
that
immunity
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government,
although
it
does
not
on
the
part
of
the
state
governments?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
doesn't
eliminate
the
state
government's
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
i
mean
that's
what
it
says.
it
says,
to
the
exte...
any
other
governmental
instrumentality
or
agency
to
the
extent
permitted
by
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
constitution.
so
i
gather
that
means
that
you
can't...
you
can't
get
any
penalty
out
of
the
state
treasury.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
don't
understand
what
that
exception
means,
then,
any
other
government
instrumentality
or
agency
to
to
the
extent
permitted...
to
the
extent
permitted
by
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
constitution.
i
thought
that
means
to
leave
in
there
state
sovereign
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
van
kley,
you
know,
if
the
main
point
is
the
embarrassment
of
the
federal
agency,
i'm
really
not
sure
that
most
of
the
administrators
i
know
are
terribly
embarrassable
people.
but
if
that
is
the
big
problem,
that
can
be
done
without
paying
any
money.
i
mean,
just
the
entry...
the
government
concedes
that
they're
suable,
and
that
an
order
can
be
entered
saying
you
have
broken
the
law.
stop
breaking
the
law.
now,
that
demonstrates
the
agency's
been
breaking
the
law.
why
isn't
that
embarrassment
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it
adds
to
that
to
say
moreover,
you're
going
to
have
to
switch
money
from
one
account
to
another
just
to
embarrass
you?
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
make
any
difference
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
from
the
standpoint
of
embarrassment?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
all
of
those
suits
to
recover
those
state
penalties
can
be
brought
in
federal
court,
because
they
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
that's
thinkable?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
penalties
are
higher,
too,
aren't
they,
as
i
recollect
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
pardon?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
lower.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could
be
higher,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
make
it
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
are
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
they
been
through
a
conference
committee
yet?
