justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
already
covered
in
the...
later
in
the
sentence.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
it
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
imposed
by
a
state.
it
doesn't
say
imposed
by
a
state
court...
state
or
local
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
state
or
local
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
unless
you
say
that...
unless
you
say
that
this...
that
because
the
state
has
a
role
in
enforcing
a
federal
statute
that...
if
the
state
has
authority
to
regulate
a
federal
agency,
which,
i
take
it,
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
clean
water
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they...
is
the
state
enforcing
a
federal
law
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it's...
but
it
arises
under
the
clean
water
act
doesn't
it?
except
for
the
clean
water
act,
the
state
wouldn't
be
doing
what
it's
doing.
and
it
certainly
wouldn't
have
the
authority
to...
to
regulate
an
agency.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
maybe
i've
got
it
here.
wait
a
minute.
well,
never
mind...
i
thought
it
was
handy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
1365
says
it
does.
any
person,
including
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
last...
the
last...
the
last
couple
of
lines
of
1365--
--where
are
you
reading
from?
in
3(a).
3(a),
1365,
the
last
sentence
or
two...
the
last
line
or
two
says
that...
says
that
a
district
court
could
apply
any
appropriate
civil
penalties
under
1319(d).
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
would
be
against
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
because...
because
person
doesn't
include
the
united
states
under
the
general
definition
of
a
person,
it
wouldn't
be
appropriate
to...
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
to
do
that,
to
do
that.
and
yet
they
were
so
subtle
about
it,
that
they've...
that
the
united
states
isn't
liable
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
still
had
to
be
decided.
let
him
answer
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
alternative
meaning?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
van
kley...
that
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you...
are
you
saying
then,
that
the...
that
the
sanctions
assessed
under
state
law
really
should
be
treated
as
arising
under
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn't
just
be
looking
to
one
of
these
sections
that
we've
just
been
looking
at.
you
would
look
at
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
sanction
imposed
by
a
state
law
that's
implementing
the
federal
act
or
implementing
the
program
that's
been
approved,
that
would
arise
under
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you...
you
think
you're
entitled
to
collect
this
money
on
several
different
independent
grounds,
like--
justice
byron
r.
white
for...
of
money
liability?
