mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this,
a
case...
this
case
arises
from
a
suit
by
the
state
of
ohio
against
the
united
states
department
of
energy,
concerning
the
operation
of
doe's
fernald,
ohio
uranium
processing
plant.
now,
all
aspects
of
the
case
have
been
settled,
other
than
the
state's
claim
for
state
and
federal
civil
penalties.
thus,
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
the
issue
before
the
court
is
solely
whether
civil
penalties
are
available
against
the
federal
government
under
four
specific
provisions
of
the
clean
water
act
and
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act,
rcra.
now
it's
our
position
that
the
provisions
are
most
reasonably
interpreted
not
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
as
to
civil
penalties.
but
the
issue
in
the
case
is
not
whether
we
can
show
that
those
provisions
mean
what
they
say
they
do.
the
issue
is,
because
this
involves
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
whether
the
state
can
show
that
congress
clearly
and
unambiguously,
in
the
language
of
these
statutes,
waived
sovereign
immunity
from
civil
penalties.
now
that,
that
is
based
on
the
well-settled
rule
that
it
is
up
to
the
state
to
prove...
to
show
that
a
waiver
exists,
that
any
doubts
concerning
whether
there's
a
waiver
should
be
resolved
against
finding
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
that
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
must
be
clear
and
unambiguous.
congress
was
well
aware
of
those
principles
at
the
time
when
the
provisions
at
issue
here
were
enacted.
indeed,
the
key
provisions,
which
are
the
federal
facilities
provisions
of
the
clean
water
act
and
of
rcra,
were
enacted
within
a
year
or
so
after
this
court's
decisions
in
hancock
against
train
and
epa
against
california,
which
specifically
rested
on
the
clear
statement
principle.
indeed,
congress
must
have
been
aware
of
that
principle.
and
i
think
if
we...
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statutes
at
issue,
it's
impossible
to
find
a
clear
and
unambiguous
waiver
under
those
standards.
now,
if
there
were
still
any
doubt,
there
are
two
features
of
the
case
that
suggest
that
that
clear
statement
rule
has
to
be
applied
with
particular
rigor.
first,
there's
the
long-settled
understanding
that
where
an
asserted
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
would
upset
the
delicate
federal-state
balance,
and
in
particular,
where
it
subjects
the
federal
government
to
regulation
by
states,
it's
particularly
appropriate
to
apply
the
clear
statement
rule.
and
that
is...
that
would
be
the
case
here.
secondly,
where
an
asserted
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
would
have
an
effect
on
the
federal...
and
perhaps
more
important
where
an
asserted
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
is
penal
in
nature,
the
court
has
also
applied
the
clear
statement
rule
with
particular
rigor.
perhaps
the
case
that's
most
closely
on
point
is
missouri
pacific
railroad--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
language
would
apply
to
civil
penalties
or...
it
would
apply
to
monetary
sanctions
which
could
be
called
civil
penalties
that
are
imposed
as
a
result
of
the
federal
government's
failure
to
comply
with
an
injunction
that
was
issued
under
the
statute.
but
that
language
itself
is
not
the
language
of
waiver.
it's
a
language
of
limitation.
so
we
would
submit
that
that
language
itself
doesn't
waive
sovereign
immunity.
and
if
you
look
at
the
earlier
language,
earlier
in
the
same
provision...
i
might
refer
you
to
page
1(a)
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief
where
it's
reprinted...
there
are
three
categories
of
items
as
to
which
sovereign
immunity
is
waived.
if
you
look
on
page
1(a),
and
about
eight
lines
down,
it's
look...
that's
requirements--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
this
is
the
federal
facilities
provision
of
the
clean
water
act.
and
there
are
three...
there
are
three
categories
of
items
waived:
requirements,
administrative--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
earlier
in
the
same
section.
and
it
would...
it's
our
understanding
of
the
provision
that
the
waiver
is
in
the
earlier
part
of
that
statute.
and
that
waiver
limits
financial
penalties
to
those
sanctions
that
are
imposed
as
a
result
of
failure
to
pay...
to
comply
with
court
process,
or
injunctive
relief.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes...
that...
the
sentence
to
which
you're
referring
is
on
2(a)
if
you're
looking
at
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
having...
it
would
be
our...
it's
our
understanding--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's
not
actually
the
last
provision...
the
last
sentence--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--of
the
statute.
it's
about
the
sixth...
maybe
the...
one,
two,
three,
four...
about
the
ninth
line
down.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
on
page
2(a).
it
says
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
only
for
those
civil
penalties
arising
under
federal
law
or
imposed
by
a
state
or
local
court
to
enforce
an
order
of
the
process
of
such
court.
having
already
limited
the
kinds
of
financial
penalties
that
could
be
paid
to
those
that
are...
that
arise
from...
having
already
limited
the
waiver
of
immunity
to
process
and
sanctions--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
and
indeed
one
of
the
problems
with
reading
this
as
itself
being
a
waiver
is
that
the
only
federal
penalties
available
are
under
section
1319.
under
section
1319
civil
penalties
are
available
only
against
a
person.
and
the
term
person,
as
defined
in
the
statute,
to
exclude
a
whole
variety
of
different
entities,
does
not
include
the
federal
government.
and
therefore--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--civil...
in
this
sentence,
civil
penalties
refers
back
to
those
penalties
that
might
be
imposed
on
the
federal
government
for
failure
to
obey
an
injunction.
when
a
state
finds
that
the
federal
government
has
not
complied
with
a
provision
of
the
clean
water
act,
it
is
permitted
to
go
into
a
court,
and
to
obtain
an
injunction--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--later
in
the
sentence
it
refers
to
state
or
local
court
to
enforce...
in
other
words,
there
is
two
categories:
there
could
be
those
actions
brought
in
a
federal
court,
in
which
case
the
penalties
that
would
be
assessed
arise
under
federal
law,
because
they
would
be
assessed
for
failure
to
obey
a
federal
court
injunction,
or
imposed--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
says
liable
only
for
those
civil
penalties
arising
under--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it...
i'm
not...
if
you're
reading
from
the
same--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--by
state
or
local
court,
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that
is
the
only...
those
are
the
only
kind
of
penalties
that
would
otherwise
be
provided
by
the
act...
or
the
only
kind
of
penalties
that
could
be
assessed
against
the
federal
government,
and
that
could
be
applied.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no...
well,
no.
the
state
is
enforcing
its
own
law.
under
the
clean
water
act,
the
structure
of
the
statute--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i'm
not
sure
that
that's
right,
although
that
issue
isn't
presented
by
this
case.
the
clean
water
act...
the
waiver...
this
provision
of
1323
waives
federal
immunity
from...
if
you
look
at
the
prior
page,
from
state
and
local
administrative
authority
from
requirements
which
we
would
understand
to
be
the
prelitigation
requirements,
those
things
that
the
federal
government
must
do
to
comply
with
the
act
and
so
on.
and
the
fact...
the
state
statutes,
for
instance,
the
state
civil
penalty
statute
at
issue
in
this
case,
was
effective
upon
enactment
by
the
state
legislature,
and
it
was
effective
against
the
federal
government
regardless
of
whether
it
received
epa
approval
or
not.
the
effect
of
having
received
epa
approval
is
simply
that
this
federal
program,
regulatory
program
is
supplanted.
and
an
entity
who's
in
the
state
of
ohio
doesn't
have
to
go
both
to
epa
to
obtain
a
permit,
and
to
the
state
administrative
agency
to
obtain
a
permit.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right...
that's
right.
and...
i
mean,
exactly.
when
i
say
that
that
arising
under
federal
law
provision
applies
only
to...
as
things
stand
right
now,
it
applies
only
to...
the
only
kind
of
federal
penalties
that
would
be
available
would
be
for
failing
to
obey
a
federal
court
injunction.
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
couldn't
be
other
federal
penalties
at
some
point
in
the
future,
that
congress
thought
that
there
were
other
federal
penalties,
or
considered
it.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there
are--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
but
those
penalties
are
applicable
only
against
a
person.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
the
term
person
is
a
defined
term
in
the
statute
that
excludes
the
united
states.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right...
well,
if--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
it's--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
wouldn't
say
it's
defined.
the
term
persons
is
otherwise
defined
in
the
citizens
suit
provision.
if
you...
that
provision
is
reprinted
at
3(a),
if
you
want
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and
for
purposes
of
citizens
suits,
the
united
states
is--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and
the
united
states
is
subject
to
a
citizens
suit,
generally.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
you
follow
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--okay,
because
the
citizens
suit
provision
generally
makes
citizens...
makes
the
united
states
amenable
to
suits
by
citizens,
like
other
entities
under
the
clean
water
act.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
doesn't
generally
change,
though,
the
types
of
relief
that
are
available
otherwise
under
the
act,
or
have
any
other
effect
on
the
united
states'
obligations
under
the
act...
other
than
that
they
can
be
enforced
at
the
behest
of
a
citizen.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
to
appropriate
penalties.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
piece
that's
missing
is
that...
i
guess
i
would
submit,
is
that
the
appropriate
civil
penalties...
civil
penalties
are
never
appropriate...
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--they
say
to
apply
appropriate
civil
penalties
under
section
1319(d)
of
this
title.
i
read
that
to
refer
back
to
1319(d)
to
find
out
what
civil
penalties
are
appropriate.
now,
that...
one
thing
that
should
be
remembered
is
that
phrase
applies
to
any
citizens
suit
against
any
entity
under
the
clean
water
act,
not
just
the
united
states.
it
would
be
an
odd
way
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
to
waive
it
in
a
sentence
that
applies
to
any
kind
of
citizens
suit.
and
indeed,
if
you
look
at
that
whole
paragraph,
what
it
really
refers
to
is
that
any
kind
of
relief
that's
ordinarily
available
under
the
clean
water
act
is
available
against
the...
whatever
is
available
otherwise,
is
available
in
a
citizens
suit.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
against
the
united
states
are
you--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
they...
i
guess
there
would...
there's
really
two
parts
to
my
answer
to
that.
this...
the
provision
which
says
that
united
states
shall
be
liable
only
for
those
civil
penalties
that
arise
under
federal
law,
that
is
limiting
the
waiver.
it's
not
extending
the
waiver.
it's
not
saying
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
for
penalties
that
arise
under
federal
law.
it
says
the
united
states--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and
i
would
read...
because
it
has
the
word
only
i
would
read
that
as
a
language
of
limitation,
rather
than
extension.
and
then
if--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it's
not
in
the
appendix,
actually--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
is--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--in
any
event,
1319(d)
is
a
relatively...
it's
a
one-paragraph
provision
that
just
says
any
person
who
violates
a
provision
of
this
statute
shall
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
is...
i
can
tell
you,
is
on
page...
if
you
look
at
our
brief
on
page
6,
it's
the
continuation
of
note
4.
it
actually
goes
from
5
to
6.
that's
in
1362(5).
it
says
the
term
person
means
an
individual,
corporation,
partnership,
association...
lists
a
number
of
entities.
and
does
not
include
the
united
states.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
and
we
would
read
that
to
include
the
united
states
as
a
person
for
purposes
of
citizens
suits,
so
that
citizens
suits
generally
may
be
brought
against
the
united
states,
but
not
to
alter
the
general
definition
of
person
for
other
provisions
of
the
statute.
and
if
you
read
1365,
the
intent
of
the
language
appears
to...
appears
to
us
to
be
that
they
didn't
want
to
alter
the
ordinary
remedial
scheme
of
the
statute
here.
that
ordinary
remedial
scheme--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right,
and
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
that
would...
that
would...
i
read
that
language
to
mean
that
when
you
have
a
citizens
suit--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
whatever
penalties
are
appropriate
in
a
citizens
suit,
may
be
applied
by
the
court.
injunctive
relief
is
appropriate
against
the
united
states
under
the
waiver
in
1323,
and
therefore--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right,
just
as
it
wouldn't
be
appropriate
to
apply
a
civil
penalty
against
a...
well,
for
situations
that
are
not
otherwise
covered
by
the
civil
penalty
provision.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
possibly
the
answer
to
that
is
if
you
look
at
1365(a)(2),
right
above
that
provision,
one
of
the
kinds
of
citizens
suits
that
you
can
bring
is
against
the
administrator--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--where
the
administrator
is--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--for
instance,
no
one's
argued
that
you
could
obtain
a
civil
penalty
against
the
administrator
by
virtue
of
that
reference
to
1319(d).
in
other
words,
where
the
suit
is
brought
against
the
administrator,
all
that
this
provision
is
doing
in
the
citizens
suit
provision
is
preserving
whatever
remedies
are
otherwise
applicable
in
citizens
suits.
so
for
instance,
where
the
action
is
brought
against
the
administrator,
the
court
may
order
the
administrator
to
perform
such
act
or
duty
as
the
case
may
be.
where
the
suit
is
brought
against
a
private
party,
the
court
may
enforce
an
effluent
standard,
or
apply
appropriate
civil
penalties.
similarly,
where
the
action
is
against
the
united
states,
the
court
may
also
enforce
an
effluent
standard
or
apply
any
appropriate
civil
penalties.
but
in
the
case
of
the
united
states,
there
are
no
appropriate
civil
penalties,
because
civil
penalties
are
not
appropriate.
in
each
case,
they
didn't
want
to
alter
the
remedial
scheme
of
the
statute
otherwise,
by
this
last
paragraph
of
the
citizens
suit
provision.
they
just
wanted
to
refer
all
questions
to
be
resolved
in
accordance
with
that...
with
that
provision.
and
it
would
be
our
submission
that
under
that
provision,
the
term
person
is
defined
in
accordance
with
the
general
definition,
and
it
excludes
the
united
states.
um...
i
think
the
case...
the
case
that's
most
close
to,
that's
closest
to
this,
and
both
with
respect
to
the
specific--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--perhaps
in
the
complexity
of
the
statutes
this
may...
this
may
go,
do
one
better
to
some
of
the
others.
but
in
the
ault
case,
for
instance,
the
operative
language
of
waiver
was
that
the
united
states--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--in
missouri
pacific
against
ault--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
it
was
a
case
that
arose
during
the
federalization
of
the
railroads
during
world
war
i.
and
congress
had
passed
a
statute
providing
that
the
federalized
rail
carriers
are
subject
to...
i
think
the
quote
is
all
laws
and
liabilities
as
common
carriers,
which
is
a
very
broad
waiver
provision,
i
think
arguably
broader
than
any
of
the
waiver
provisions
that
you
find
here...
that
you
find
here
in
the
earlier
part
of
1323
at
least.
the
court
held
that
although
that
provision
subjecting
the
united
states
to
all
laws
and
liabilities
did
subject
the
united
states
to
compensatory
remedies,
it
did
not
extend
to
penal
measures.
it...
a
particularly
clear
statement
is
required
before
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunities
should
extend
to
penal
measures.
in
1323,
i
think
you
don't
find
such
a
clear
waiver
in
any
of
the
positive...
in
any
of
the
positive
terms
of
the
statute
that
purport
to
be
a
waiver,
neither
the
term
requirements,
nor
administrative
authority,
nor
process
and
sanctions.
for
the
reasons
i
said
before,
i
think
process
and
sanctions
is
coupled
as
a
single
term,
grammatically
in
the
statute,
and
also
structurally
where
it's
listed
under--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes...
i
think
sanctions
could
be
referred
to...
sanctions
could
be
used
to
refer
to
penalties.
however,
in
this
particular
provision,
i
think
because
it's
coupled
with
process,
they
did...
it
was
not
a
list
of
four
items:
requirements,
administrative
authority,
process,
comma,
and
sanctions,
but
rather
requirements,
administrative
authority,
comma,
and
process
and
sanctions.
and
that's
reinforced
by
the
following
provision
which
lists
each
of
those
three
things,
a,
b,
c.
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
sanctions
that
are
necessary
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
court's
process.
and
that
would
include
injunctive
relief,
sanctions
to
enforce
injunctive
relief,
but
would
not
include
civil
penalties.
at
the
very
least,
that
creates
enough
of
an
ambiguity
or
it
couldn't
be
said
that
that
term,
process
and
sanctions,
unambiguously
waived
sovereign
immunity.
and
that's
what
the
state
would
have
to
show
here.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
these
statutes
were
rewritten...
were
amended
to
some
extent.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
with
due
respect,
i
think
that
they
did
exactly
what
they
intended
to
do,
which
is
they
subjected
the
united
states
to
the
full
range
of
administrative
authority
of
states,
of
the
state's
substantive
requirements,
of
permanent
requirements,
of
reporting
requirements.
and
those
were
the
things
that
congress
had
on
its
mind
as
a
result
of
the
court's
decisions
in
hancock
against
train
and
epa
against
california.
but
i
think
what
congress
didn't
do,
was
go
farther
and
give
any
positive
consideration
to,
or
decide
that
they
wanted
to
subject
the
federal
government
to
civil
penalties.
that's...
i
don't
see
that
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
or
in
what
they
did.
and
certainly
they
didn't
unambiguously
do
that.
and,
indeed,
they
knew...
they
should
have
known
as
a
result
of
hancock
and
epa
against
california
that
an
unambiguous
waiver
is
what
was
required.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
there
would
certainly
be
a
case
or
controversy
as
between
the
state
of
ohio,
for
instance,
and
the
federal
government
here.
because
they're
asserting
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--as
to
the
enforcement--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--even
as
to
the
penalties,
to
some
extent.
it
might
be
questioned
whether
there
is,
and
indeed,
i
think
the
strangeness
of
having
that
kind
of
procedure,
where
money
is
coming
from
one
pocket
of
the
federal
treasury,
and
going
into
another,
indeed,
it
may
be
coming
from
the
same
pocket
and
going
right
back
into
that
same
pocket.
the
strangeness
of
that
proceeding
is
one
reason
why
congress
may
not
have
provided
for
civil
penalties
here,
or
at
least
would
have
wanted
to
think
twice
before
doing
so,
and
i
think
a
clear
indication
that
they
wanted
to
should
be
found
before
they--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
agree
that
it
would
be...
i
agree
that
it
would
be
questionable.
and
again,
i
think
that's
another
reason
not
to
assume
that
congress
would
have
intended
something
that
both
is
questionable,
perhaps
from
a
standing
point
of
view,
and
it
would
apparently
be
a
rather
futile
gesture.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
believe...
i
believe
we
do.
i
certainly
think
that
whenever
the
executive--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
there
are
such
cases.
whenever
one
branch...
one
part
of
the
executive
branch...
whenever
the
executive
branch
is
on
both
sides
of
the
case,
it
certainly
raises
a
question
about
the
case,
about
case
or
controversy.
i'd
like...
if
there
are
no
further
questions
right
now,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
just
like
to
make
two
points,
one
specific,
and
one
more
general.
the
specific
point
is,
as
to
the
arising
under
federal
law
clause
that
i
discussed
earlier,
i
think
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
that
provision
was
added
by
a
conference
committee.
it
wasn't
in
either
the
senate
or
house
versions
of
the
bill
when
it
was
first
enacted.
the
legislative
history
you
can
find
in
our
brief.
there's
no
legislative
history
or
no
commentary
on
what
that
provision
might
have
meant,
or
what
the
conferees
thought
it
meant.
and
i
think
that
that
adds
perhaps
some
plausibility
to
the
view
that
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
whatever
else
had
already
been
done,
or
had
already
been
waived
in
the
statute,
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
in
any
event,
they
wanted
to
cancel
it
if
it
didn't
arise
under
federal
law,
or
it
would
pose
a
state
or
a...
order
a
process
of
a
state
or
local
court.
i
think
the
history
kind
of
supports
that
inference.
the
more
general
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
the
case
really
is
about
whether
there
is
a
clear
and
unambiguous
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
statutes
at
issue
here.
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
of
liability
for
civil
penalties
of
the
sort
that
the
state
seeks
here.
i
don't...
i
think
in
light
of
going
running
through
these
statutes,
and
seeing
the
difficulties
of
interpreting
them,
the
best
you
could
say
is
that
it's
ambiguous.
now,
congress,
at
this
very...
well,
not
this
very
moment,
they're
in
recess...
but
they've
recently
enacted
amendments
to
the
rcra
provision
that's
also
at
issue
in
this
suit
that
would
clearly
and
unambiguously
waive
sovereign
immunity
from
civil
penalties.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
and
as
i've...
at
least
the
provisions,
as
i
have
seen
the
most
recent
versions,
they
were
passed
in
different
versions
by
the
house
and
the
senate.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
not
yet.
[laughter]
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
we
don't,
if
that
becomes
law.
but
the
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
one
function
of
the
rule
requiring
waivers
to
be
clear
and
unambiguous,
especially
when
there's
penal
measures
of
this
sort
at
issue,
is
to
require
congress
to
go
and
look
at
the
specific
problems,
and
the
specific
issues
that
arise
concerning
federal...
concerning
civil
penalties
against
federal
facilities.
and
that's
one
of
the
functions
of
the
rule,
and
that's
one
of
the
real
reasons
the
rule
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
applying
in
a
case
like
this.
thank
you
very
much.
