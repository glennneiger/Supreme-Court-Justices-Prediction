justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
feldman,
because
there
is
one
sentence
in
the
statute
that
does
seem
rather
clear.
it
says...
just
the
second
half
of
it
on
page
58
of
your
opinion...
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
only
for
those
civil
penalties
arising
under
federal
law.
now,
in
any
case,
it
must
arise
under
federal
law.
but
can
you
not...
can
that
any
way
possibly
be
interpreted
to
say
there's
no
case
in
the
world
in
which
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
for
a
civil
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
position
that
there
is
simply
no
case
to
which
that
language
applies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
same
section
from
which
i
just
read.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
feldman,
there
are
some
penalties
that
arise
under
federal
law.
are
there
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
1319(d)
describes
a
set
of
penalties
that
arise
under
federal
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
it's
also
defined
to
include
the
united
states
in
another
provision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
citizens
suit
provision,
it
expressly
includes
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
united
states
is
a
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
it
says
may
bring
a
suit
against
any
person,
paren,
including
(1)
the
united
states,
and
(2)
any
other
government
agent.
that
surely
includes
the
united
states
within
the
concept
of
person
in
that
section.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
is
a
citizens
suit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
is
another
provision
of
the
statute
that
describes
penalties
that
may
be
awarded,
arise
under
federal
law.
why
isn't
that
an
appropriate
remedy
under
this
case...
i
don't
understand.
i
mean
maybe
i'm
just
dumb.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
can
be
subject
to
appropriate
penalties.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
an
appropriate
penalty
is
one
arising
under
federal
law,
according
to
this
earlier
section.
and
we've
got
a
federal
statute
describing
penalties
arising
under
federal
law.
i
don't
know
what...
which
piece
is
missing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
against
the
united
states
unless
they
arise
under
federal
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
not...
the
state
of
ohio
couldn't
pass
a
statute
saying
the
penalties
should
be
$1
million
a
day.
that
would
not
be
permissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that
would
not
arise
under
federal
law.
but
this
limits...
in
other
words,
this
clearly
limits
it
to
those
that
are
described
in
1319(d).
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
those
in
1319(d)
don't
arise
under
federal
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
says
in
so
many
words,
shall
be
liable.
it
also
has
the
word
only
in
that.
but
it
says,
shall
be
liable
for
those
penalties.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
feldman,
let
me
just
point
this
out.
this
talks
about
relief
against
the
administrator,
as
defined
in
1319(d).
by
hypothesis,
the
administrator
could
not
be
a
defendant
in
1319(d)
because
that's
the
penalties
that
he
may
obtain
in
litigation.
in
1319
they
are
enforcement
actions
by
the
administrator.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
you
refer
to
that
for
the
general
citizens
suit
provision,
you
can't
just...
can't
say
they
can
do
it
in
suits
against
the
administrator,
and
then
say
it's
got
to
be
an
appropriate
penalty
in
a
suit
brought
by
the
administrator,
is
what
you're
arguing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
1319
deals
with
litigation
initiated
by
the
administrator.
so
by
hypothesis,
the
administrator
could
not
be
a
defendant
in
a
1319(d)
suit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
how
can
you
then
say
that
when
they
refer
to
the
administrator
in
this
provision,
they're
excluding...
they're
excluding
cases
in
which...
the
united
states?
because
by
hypothesis
here,
he's
a
defendant
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
and
the
appropriate
remedy
for
that
suit
is
found
in
1319(d),
according
to
the
very
suit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
word
sanction
quite
frequently
is
used
to
refer
to
the
kind
of
penalties
that
are
inscribed
in
1319(d)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
neither
of
those
refers
to
penalties
arising
under.
this
is
a
cause
of
action
arising
under.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand,
your...
what
you're
saying
is
the
penalties,
even
though
described
in
an
ohio
statute,
arise
under
federal
law
because
the
statute
was
enacted
pursuant
to
the
federal
program
and
has
been
approved
by
the
administrator.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's...
and
if
that's
true,
i
don't
know
how
you
answered
justice
scalia.
because
then
it
seems
to
me
any
suit
under
the
state
program
arises
under
federal
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
purpose
here,
as
your
opponent
has
rather
forcefully
argued,
is
to
limit
the
liability
of
the
united
states
as
liable
only
for
those
civil
penalties.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
it's
rather
strange
to
say
you
will
limit
these.
but
if
we
prove
it
under...
well,
anyway,
under
a
state
program,
it
still
arises
under
federal
law.
that's
certainly
not
a
natural
reading
of
that
word.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
even
looking
at
any
cases.
i'm
just...
like
my
colleagues
on
the
right
here,
i
just
agree...
and
we
just
looked
at
this
language.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
talk
about
arising
under
federal
law,
that's
a
rather
odd
way
to
say
arising
under
state
laws
that
have
been
enacted
pursuant
to
a
federal
program,
or
approved
by
a
federal
agency,
which
is
what
you're
reading
as.
but
you're...
you
rely
entirely
on
this
argument,
and
you
don't
rely
on
the
citizens
suit
provisions.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you...
just
to
get
a
different
scale
of
penalties,
is
that
the
reason
for
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
may
i
just
put
one...
there
are
two
rather
separate
theories
under
the
clean
water
act.
one
is
the
one
you've
argued
almost
entirely
now.
the
second
is
the
citizens
suit
theory
that
i
debated
with
your
opponent.
is
there
a
difference
in
the
outcome
of
the
litigation,
depending
on
which
theory
one
might
buy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
so
that's
why
you're
not
arguing
the
citizens
suit
provision
very
vigorously.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
understand
now
why
you've
concentrated
your
argument
on
this,
rather
than
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
if
one
looks
at
plain
language
you've
got
a
much
stronger
argument
on
the
other.
i
don't
know
whether
you're
right
or
not,
but
surely
the
waiver
is
much
more
clear
in
the
citizens
suit--
--well,
i
thought
maybe
you
wanted
to
enforce
this
law
and
sue
under
the
citizens
suit
provision
and
recover
those
federal
penalties
because
then
you're
going
to
punish
the
agency
by
taking
their
money
away
and
giving
it
to
somebody
else
in
the
federal
government.
