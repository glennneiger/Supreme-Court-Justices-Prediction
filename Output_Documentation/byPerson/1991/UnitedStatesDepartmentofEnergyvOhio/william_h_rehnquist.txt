chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-1341,
united
states
department
of
energy
v.
ohio,
and
90-1517,
ohio
v.
united
states
department
of
energy.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
1(a)
of
what,
mr.
feldman?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
does
the
last
sentence
that
is
being
referred
to
begin?
is
it
towards
the
bottom
of
2(a)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
page
2(a)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
does
seem
odd
that
if
they
meant
simply
pay
civil
contempt
penalties
imposed
by
a
federal,
state,
or
local
court,
they
would
word
the
sentence
this
way.
they
talk
about
penalties
arising
under
federal
law.
and
you're
saying
that
should
be
read
as
if
it
meant
penalties
imposed
by
federal
courts
for
failing
to
obey
an
injunction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
van
kley,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
please,
if
you're
going
to
read
anything
from
the
statute,
please
tell
us
where
you...
or
where
you
are
going
to
read
from.

1365--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--on
3(a)
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
what
is
the
reason
for
putting
in
the
reference
to
the
eleventh
amendment
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
this
really
strike
you
as
a
model
of
clarity?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
whole
thing...
i
mean,
the
rule
is
that
to
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states,
you
must
have
a
clear
statement,
and
it
must
be
unambiguous.
and
here
we
are,
just
wrestling
with
very
vague
and
often
self-contradictory
terms.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
you
sum
up,
perhaps
in
two
or
three
sentences,
exactly
how
you
reason
your
way
through
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--this
is
perfectly
clear?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree,
mr.
van
kley,
that
penalties
under...
is
it
under
1365,
the
citizens
suit,
are
paid
to
the
united
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
doesn't
it
seem
odd
that
the
united
states
would
be
sued
and
its
penalty
would
be
paid
to
the
united
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
indication
that
congress
realized
that
it
was
imposing
sanctions
on
the
united
states
which
would
be
paid
to
the
united
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
doesn't
say
that.
now,
you're...
it
says
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
only
for
those
penalties
arising
under
federal
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
not
what
you
said.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
continue
with
your
answer
to
justice
souter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
van
kley.
mr.
feldman,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1341,
united
states
department
of
energy
versus
ohio
and
a
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
