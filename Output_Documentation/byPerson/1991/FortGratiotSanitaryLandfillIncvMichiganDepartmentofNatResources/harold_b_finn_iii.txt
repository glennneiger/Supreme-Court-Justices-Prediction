mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
owns
and
operates
a
private
landfill
in
st.
clair
county,
michigan.
in
1988
michigan
amended
its
solid
waste
management
act--
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
--yes,
sir.
by
adopting
waste
importation
restrictions,
namely
section
13(a)
and
subsection
(2)
of
section
30
of
the
act,
which
prohibit,
in
the
case
of
st.
clair
county,
the
importation
into
the
country
of
municipal
solid
waste
generated
out-of-county
or
out-of-state.
on
its
face
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
these
waste
importation
restrictions
by
prohibiting
the
importation
of
out-of-state
waste
into
petitioner's
landfill
impermissibly
discriminate
against
out-of-state
commerce
by,
because
in-county
municipal
waste
is
subject
to
no
such
constraint.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
that's
correct,
sir.
this
is
plain
garbage.
this
is
not
hazardous
waste.
this
is
not
lowlevel
radioactive
waste.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
under
the
regulations
that
have
been
promulgated
by
the
state
of
michigan,
the
transportation
of
municipal
solid
waste
if
it
is
moisture
laden
must
be
transported
in
trucks
that
are
sealed
and
not
capable
of
leaking.
in
the
case
of
all
other
municipal
solid
waste
they
must
be
covered
and
carried
in
a
manner
that
does
not
create
a
nuisance.
the
same
would
be
true
under
the
new
regulations
that
are--
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
--in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
no
one
has
suggested
that
the
quarantine
cases
are
applicable.
in
the
first
place
there
is
nothing,
in
the
first
place
the
regulations
that
have
been
promulgated
by
michigan
make
it
clear
that
there
is
no
risk
of
disease
or
pestilence
coming
into
the
state,
and
the
new
regulations
that
have
been
promulgated
by
the
federal
epa
make
it
clear
that
there
need
not
be
any
risk
of
disease
or
pestilence.
indeed
michigan
allows
out-of-state
waste
to
come
into
michigan
now,
albeit
to
a
minor
extent,
from
neighboring
states.
so
i
don't
think
the
quarantine
cases
are
applicable
here,
nor
has
michigan
suggested
that
they
are
applicable.
one
of
the
amicus
has
suggested
that
the
quarantine
cases
may
be
applicable,
and
it
may
well
be.
in
some
states
the
regulations
and
laws
are
so
lax
as
to
create
risks,
but
that's
not
true
in
michigan.
there
is
an
even
more
important
question,
however,
at
stake
in
this
case,
and
that's
whether
or
not
this
court
is
going
to
uphold
the
novel
new
constitutional
principle
that
was
relied
upon
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
upholding
the
waste
importation
restrictions.
that
new
constitutional
principle
is
that
state
legislation
which
excludes
foreign
commerce
from
local
areas
within
the
state
does
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
so
long
as
like
commerce
from
elsewhere
in
the
state
is
subject
to
the
same
embargo.
acceptance
of
that
new
principle
would
have
extraordinary
consequences.
by
way
of
illustration,
if
this
principle
were
adopted
by
this
court
a
district
comprised
of
the
southern,
the
counties
of
southern
california
could
impose
an
embargo
upon
or
a
discriminatory
tariff
upon
goods
coming
from
arizona
so
long
as
like
commerce
coming
from
northern
california
were
subject
to
the
same
constraint
or
the
same
discriminatory
tariff.
that
principle
simply
cannot
be
allowed
to
stand
by
this
court.
it
is
hopelessly
inconsistent
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
it
belies
the
basic
principles
that
underlie
the
commerce
clause,
and
it
would
eventually
result
in
the
evisceration
of
the
negative
aspects--
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
--yes,
it
did,
justice
scalia...
justice
o'connor.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
there
is
no
question
in
our
mind
that
the
sixth
circuit
applied
the
incorrect
test.
in
our
judgment
once
discrimination
exists,
this
court's
decision,
decisions
in
the
past
have
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
strict
scrutiny
test
should
apply,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
as
the
state,
the
respondents,
seem
to
suggest,
that
it's
local
discrimination
versus
statewide
discrimination.
somehow
the
sixth
circuit
made
that
distinction.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
well,
in
brimmer
v.
rebman,
which
was
decided
in
1891,
in
dean
milk
v.
the
city
of
madison
in
1954,
and
in
polar
ice
cream
and
creamery
co.,
this
court
has
held
that
it's
immaterial
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
there
is
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
that
in-state
commerce
is
subject
to
the
same
constraint.
and
that,
those
decisions
in
brimmer
v.
rebman,
dean
milk,
and
polar
ice
cream
and
creamery
co.,
they're
consistent
with
and
they're
part
of
a
line
of
nine
cases
in
which
this
court
has
over
the
past
119
years
consistently
and
repeatedly
held
that
embargoes
against
foreign
commerce,
be
they
statewide
or
local,
overt
or
disguised,
violate
the
commerce
clause.
this
case
does
not
present
a
new
concept.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
well,
in
this
case
it's
the
question
of--
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
--the,
there's
no
question
but
that
the
landfill
is
itself
engaged
in
commerce.
what
the
landfill
wishes
to
do
and
what
the
people
who
wish
to
have
waste
brought
to
the
landfill
wish
to
do
is
to
engage
in
the
interstate
commerce
of
bringing
municipal
solid
waste
into
that
landfill.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
that's,
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
it
would
not
be
discriminatory.
that's
the
infirmity
in
this
statute.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
the
discrimination
is
made
against
the
citizens
and
businesses
of
other
states
in
this
instance
who
are
prohibited
from
bringing
municipal
solid
waste
into
st.
clair
county,
whereas
the
citizens
and
businesses
of
st.
clair
county
are
free
to
put
their
waste
into
the
landfill
without
constraint.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
that
discrimination
is
what's
impermissible.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
if
they
choose
to
do
that,
that
would
be...
i
can't
address
whether
that
would
be
permissible
or
not.
it
would
not
violate
my
view
of
what
i
am
arguing
here
today.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
think
that's
why
the
county
is
objecting
to--
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
--yes,
they
do,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
well,
their
alternative
is
not--
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
--to
some
extent
municipal
solid
waste
as
it
starts
from
our
respective
homes
or
our
respective
businesses
contains
materials
that
can
be
removed
from
the
solid
waste,
such
as
recyclables,
plastics,
aluminum,
or
the
like.
i,
when
the
municipal
solid
waste
is
brought
to
the
landfill
it
is
not,
we
are
not
currently
processing
municipal
solid
waste.
i
think
the
problem
with
suggesting
that
municipal
solid
waste
is
not
an
article
of
commerce,
which
has
not
been
suggested
in
the
briefs
but
is
implicit
in
the
questions,
is
where,
what
is
the
neutral
principle
that
would
apply:
is
it
that
when
you
reach
the
end
of
usefulness
it's
no
longer
articles
of
commerce?
that...
first
of
all,
the
neutral
principle
would
likewise
apply
to
the
dead,
dead
human
beings,
and
that
would
make
the
funeral
home
business
or
the
cemetery
business
not
being
engaged
in
commerce.
in
the
same
manner--
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
--i
think
it's
clear
that
congress
would
think
that
it
had
the
power
to
regulate
the
funeral
home
industry
or
the
cemetery
industry
because
it
was
regulating
a
matter
of
interstate
commerce.
also,
to
suggest
that
this
article
of
commerce
is
not,
rather
that
municipal
solid
waste
is
not
an
article
of
commerce
is
to
not,
to
deny
reality.
this
is
a
multi-billion
dollar
business,
and
to
suggest
that
it's
not
an
article
of
commerce
is
to
ignore
reality.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
other
than
the
problem
of
expropriating
the
existing
privately-owned
landfills,
i
think
the
county
would
have
the
power,
the
state
would
have
the
power
to
prohibit
the
operation
of
private
landfills.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
well,
i
wouldn't
have
a
private
landfill
in
that
case.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
but
i
don't,
we
don't
question
but
that
the
state
can,
through
the
market
participant
doctrine,
restrict
out-of-state
waste
from
coming
into
the
state,
into
the
state-owned
or
county-owned
landfills.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
the
citizens
and
businesses
of
the
county,
of
st.
clair
county,
have
an
opportunity
to
put
their
municipal
solid
waste
in
petitioner's
private
landfill
whereas
citizens
and
businesses
out-of-county
don't
have
that
opportunity.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
well,
i
think
it's
a
broader--
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
--it
is
true
that
this
court
has
talked
repeatedly
in
terms
of
economic
protectionism,
but
it
has
to
be
recognized
that
virtually
all
of
the
nine
embargo
cases
that
this
court
has
struck
down
over
the
past
119
years
involved
the
argument
on
the
part
of
the
state
that
their
statute
was
justified
by
some
legitimate
purpose.
the
reason
the
statutes
were
struck
down
is
that
the
embargo,
that
is
the
means
of
achieving
that
purpose
was
impermissible.
it
was,
that
was
what
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
well,
it
was
also
cited,
the
state,
or
rather
the
city
contended
that
they
needed
to
have
the
local
requirement
for
processing
of
milk
in
order
to
be
able
to
adequately
inspect.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
but
the
court
did
not
buy
that.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
well,
i--
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
--i
think
what
they
are
trying
to
protect
is
the
need
for
local
expenditures
and
to
protect
citizens
from
competition.
let
me
illustrate,
if
i
may.
it
is
clear
from
the
briefs
of
the
respondents
and
the
amici
that
landfills
are
not
natural
resources.
they
are
engineered
and
manufactured
facilities
which
can
be
sited
anywhere,
depending
solely
on
cost.
in
other
words,
if
that,
that
being
the
case,
these
statutes
are
designed
to
restrict
the
free
flow
of
municipal
solid
waste
into
the
state
and
to
reserve
private
landfills
so
as
to
enable
the
state
and
the
county
to
avoid
the
costs
of
creating
new
landfills,
and
also
to
avoid
the
competition.
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
to
take
over,
in
effect,
the
private
landfill
of
petitioner
and
make
it
available
for
the
state
use
only.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
st.
clair...
it's
just
a
question
of
creating
space.
st.
clair
county
or
the
state
of
michigan
or
any
of
the
states
can
create
the
space.
it's
not
a
natural
resource.
it
is
simply
erecting
and
manufacturing,
in
effect,
a
ship
on
the
land
that
is
safe
for
the
disposal
of
municipal
solid
waste.
so
it's
not
a
question
of
running
out
of
space.
it's
a
question
of
incurring
the
cost
to
create
the
space,
and
that's
what
the
state
doesn't
want
to
do.
and
in
fact
they
want
to
protect
themselves
from
having
to
incur
that
cost
in
the
future
by
preventing
citizens
from
other
states
from
bringing
their
municipal
solid
waste
into
st.
clair
county.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
i
think
that's
the
essence
of
economic
protectionism.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
there
is
no
question
about
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
that's
why
we're
here.
we
are
unable
to
accept
the
higher
prices
that
are
offered
by
out-of-state
citizens
and
businesses.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
also
point
out
that
it's
not
just
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
or
is
not
economic
protectionism.
in
the
case
of
maine
v.
taylor
the
court
found
that
the
embargo
was
permissible
because
the
bait
fish
were
likely
to
be
infected
with
parasites,
but
it
nonetheless
subjected
the
maine
statute
to
the
strict
scrutiny
test.
the
twofold
test
being
one,
whether
the
statute
serves
a
legitimate
purpose,
and
two,
whether
there
is
available
a
non-discriminatory
means.
and
in
the
case
of
the
maine
bait
fish
statute
the
statute
passed
that
test.
i,
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
this
legislation,
the
waste
importations
do
not
pass
that
strict
scrutiny
test.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
i
don't
think
that
the
quarantine
cases
present
any
threat.
they
haven't
claimed
that
they
present
any
threat,
and
they
would
be
hard
pressed
to
do
so
since
they
take
it
from
out-of-state
as
it
is,
albeit
in
limited
quantities.
i'd
like
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
problem
of
local
regional
discrimination.
the
problem
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle
about
regional
discrimination
is
that
it
puts
citizens
of
the
region,
of
the
preferred
region,
on
a
different
footing
from
citizens
of
all
the
states.
they
will
therefore
tend,
as
james
madison
said
about
connecticut's
discriminatory
tariff
of
1784,
to
beget
retaliating
regulations
not
less
expensive
and
vexatious
in
themselves
than
they
are
destructive
of
the
general
harmony.
these
regional
discriminations,
these
regional
embargoes
will
enable
the
state
to
place
itself
in
a
position
of
economic
isolation
and
ultimately
will
lead
to
an
evasion
of
the
strictures
of
the
commerce
clause.
that's
exactly
what
pennsylvania
proposes
to
do
with
their
new
legislation.
the
governor
has
proposed
to
divide
pennsylvania
up
into
four
quadrants
called
waste
sheds.
each
waste
shed
will
be
allowed
to
accept
municipal
solid
waste
only
from
within
the
waste
shed.
the
result
will
be
that
every
citizen
and
business
in
pennsylvania
will
have
a
place
to
put
his
or
her
municipal
solid
waste,
but
no
one
from
outside
pennsylvania
will
be
able
to
bring
municipal
solid
waste
into
pennsylvania.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
upheld
discriminatory
legislation
which
discriminates
against
foreign
articles
of
commerce
or
against
foreign
citizens
and
businesses
on
the
basis
that
it
was
a
temporary
planning
measure.
there
are
some
quarantine
cases--
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
--well,
i
don't
think
it
would
take
it
out
of
the
strict
scrutiny
test
because
the
strict
scrutiny
test
is
applied
whenever
discrimination
is
found.
it
may
be
that
you
could
subject
it
to
the
strict
scrutiny
test
and
on
your
hypothetical
conclude
that
the
purpose
was
legitimate
and
that
there
was
no
available
alternative.
a
finite
period
of
time
to
decide
how
you're
going
to
handle
this
might
well
fall
under
that
category.
this
case,
of
course,
does
not
fit
into
that
category.
this
is
an,
a
forever
ban.
i
don't
think
the
pike
test
would
ever
be
applicable
in
the
hypothetical
you
have
described,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
couldn't
pass
scrutiny.
apparently
recognizing
that
this
court
is
likely
to
hold
that
the
waste
importation
restrictions
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce,
the
respondents
and
the
amici
have
suggested
a
number
of
novel
theories
upon
which
they
would
have
this
court
distinguish
city
of
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey
or
even
overrule
it,
and
they
would
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
the
waste
importation
restrictions
do
not
violate
or
indeed
are
not
even
subject
to
the
commerce
clause.
we
have
attempted
to
address
these
novel
arguments
in
our
reply
brief
and
to
anticipate
them
to
some
extend
in
our
brief
on
the
merits,
and
i
do
not
propose
to
do
so
here
in
oral
argument.
i
do
think
it
appropriate
to
spend
a
moment
addressing
the
state's
apparent
principle
claim
that
sporhase
v.
nebraska
justifies
a
different
result.
sporhase
held
that
the,
a
state
statute,
the
portion
of
a
state
statute
which
prohibited
the
exportation
of
water
across
the
state
line
was
unconstitutional.
so
rather
than
help
the
state
in
this
case,
sporhase
dictates
the
conclusion
that
a
state
statute
which
prohibits
the
importation
of
municipal
solid
waste
across
state
lines
violates
the
commerce
clause.
also,
to
the
extent
that
sporhase
condoned
a
discriminatory
requirement,
that
exportation
of
water
be
allowed
only
with
a
permit,
it's
irrelevant
to
this
case.
in
the
first
place
a
discriminatory
permit
is
far
less
onerous
as
a
constitutional
matter
than
an
outright
discriminatory
embargo.
in
the
second
place,
there
is
no
permit
available
here.
there
is
no
means
by
permit
that
one
could
obtain
the
right
to
bring
municipal
solid
waste
into
the
county.
in
addition,
in
sporhase
it
doesn't
even
appear
that
the
permit
requirement
was
discriminatory.
the
in-state
use
was
subject
to
extraordinary
constraints.
indeed
a
landowner
in
the
district
that
was
involved
in
sporhase
couldn't
even
sell
his
water.
and
finally,
sporhase,
it
has
to
be
recognized,
involved
a
special
scarce
natural
resource,
water,
which
has
always
been
subject
to
special
consideration
in
this
court,
whereas
here
we're
dealing
with
an
engineered
and
manufactured
facility
which
is
capable
of
being
sited
anywhere,
depending
solely
on
cost.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
well,
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
briefs
of
the
respondents
and
the
amici
that
that's
no
longer
necessary.
you
now
are
required,
indeed
if
one
looks
at
the
regulations
that
have
been
promulgated
by
the
epa,
to
have
liners
in
all
new
landfills
that
will
avoid
the
problem
of
having
to
choose
particular
soil.
you
don't
want
to
put
it
on
an
earthquake
zone.
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
but
it
is,
as
i
have
described,
more
akin
to
building
a
ship
on
top
of
the
land.
this
court
has
never
before
upheld
a
discriminatory
embargo
except
in
the
case
of
a
necessary
quarantine.
a
quarantine,
the
quarantine
cases
aren't
applicable
here,
and
there
would
be
no
principle
basis
for
the
court
to
uphold
these
discriminatory
embargoes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
the
section
13(a)
and
subsection
(2)
of
the
act
prohibit
any
public
or
private
landfill
in
the,
in
any
county
from
accepting
waste,
municipal
solid
waste,
unless
it
is
expressly
authorized
in
the
county
plan.
in
1988
at
the
time
that
the
waste
importation
restrictions
were
enacted
and
at
all
times
thereafter
the
st.
clair
county
plan
did
not
permit
the
importation
of
municipal
solid
waste
from
out-of-county.
so
the
act
at
the
moment
it
was
passed
and
at
all
times
since
has
barred
absolutely
the
importation
of
municipal
solid
waste
into
st.
clair
county.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
it
is--
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
--i
am
challenging
the
act
as
it
incorporates
the
st.
clair
county
solid
waste
management
plan
as
it
was
in
effect
at
the
time.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
that
is
correct.
it
is
on
its
face
by
incorporating
the
st.
clair
county
solid
waste
management
plan,
or
in
effect
in
either
case
the
result
is
the
same.
the
suggestion
that
there
is
a
safety
concern,
i
don't...
it
is
not
in
the
briefs,
it
is
not
in
the
record.
obviously
one
wants
to
handle
municipal
solid
waste
in
a
manner
that
doesn't
create
a
safety
problem.
and
i
think
in
the
case
of
michigan
their
regulatory
and
legislative
scheme
prevents
there
from
being
any
safety
problem
so
long
as
it's
handled
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
act
and
the
regulations.
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
under
the
new
epa
regulations
there
is
no
need
for
there
to
be
any
safety
problem.
indeed
the
new
regulations
specifically
state
that
the
minimum
national
criteria
prescribed
therein
insure
the
protection
of
human
health
and
the
environment.
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
that
michigan
is
in
a
special
place
because
it's
bearing
a
burden,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
edwards
v.
california.
there
california
attempted
to
impose
criminal
sanctions
upon
anyone
who
brought
indigents
into
the
state
of
california,
and
california
contended
that
during
the
period
of
the
depression
when
indigents
coming
into
the
state
would
put
the
state
to
extraordinary
strains,
they
should
be
allowed
to
avoid
this
burden,
and
this
court,
as
you
all
know,
rejected
that
contention
on
commerce
clause
grounds.
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
every
state
bears
the
burden
of
other
by-products
of
other
states.
for
example,
connecticut
bears
the
burden
of
the
soot
and
smoke
and
pollution
that
comes
out
of
michigan's
factories.
no
one
would
suggest
that
we
can
take
retaliatory
steps
in
connecticut
to
prevent
michigan
by
way
of
preventing
michigan
products
from
coming
into
connecticut,
or
otherwise
to
alleviate
our
burden.
here
michigan
seeks
to
impose
the
burden
that
it
believes
it
is
undertaking--
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
--no
garbage
is
coming
to
this
landfill.
none
is
allowed
in.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
there
was
a
proposal
to
bring
it,
as
i
recall,
from
the
new
york
area.
i
finally
want
to
point
out
that
if
michigan
or
the
other
states
believed
that
this,
that
the
commerce
clause
causes
them
burdens
that
they
find
unacceptable,
that's
a
political
question.
there
are
21
states
who
have
joined
as
amici
with
michigan,
and
that
creates
22
states
or
44
senators
who
have
the
power
to
do
something
about
this.
as
justice
mckenna
said
in
west
v.
kansas
natural
gas,
if
there
is
to
be
any
turning
backward
it
must
be
done
by
the
authority
of
another
instrumentality
than
a
court.
that
is
congress
has
the
responsibility
to
act
in
this
matter,
and
it
hasn't
chosen
to
do
so.
mr.
harold
b.
finn,
iii
i
would
hope
that
the
states
can
exert
a
sufficient
influence
either
through
their
populace,
which
seems
to
be
the
one
that's,
the
populace
seems
to
be
objecting
more
than
anything
to
the
placement
of
landfills,
and
they
are
the
ones
that
elect
the
senators.
and
if
they
don't
like
it
i
think
they
can
exert
the
political
pressure
to
get
a
political
change.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
