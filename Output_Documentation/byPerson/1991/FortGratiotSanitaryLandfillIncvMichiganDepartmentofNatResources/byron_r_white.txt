justice
white
i
take
it
this
waste
is
not
of
the
kind
that
we
were
talking
about
in
the
last
case?
justice
white
how...
i
take
it
that
the
state
allows
a
county,
however,
to
take
out-of-state
waste?
justice
white
and
how
many
counties
have
in
their
plan
permission
to
do
that?
justice
white
and
the,
but
none
of
the
rest
of
them?
justice
white
and
unless
it
does
then
the
state
law
forbids
the
importation?
justice
white
so
it's
a
state
law
that
puts
the
teeth
in
this
arrangement?
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
just
because
the
state
operates
through
the
county
that
it's
off
the
hook?
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
state
had
a
law
that
says
no
solid
waste
from
outside
the
state
may
be,
may
come
into
this
state?
justice
white
well,
suppose
there's
an
operator
of
an
amusement
park
in
st.
clair
county
and
the
county,
and
the
state
has
a
law
like
this
that
anybody,
any
county
that
wants
to
keep
amusement,
to
prevent
amusement
parks
from
catering
to
out-of-state
visitors
may
do
so?
justice
white
well
what,
what's
the
difference?
justice
white
this
amusement
park
operator
wants
to
do
business
with
out-of-state
visitors,
and
the
state
says
well,
the
county
can
keep
them
out,
and
the
county
has.
the
county
just
doesn't
like
the
traffic
that
is
coming
in
from
out-of-state.
justice
white
well,
neither
would
this
be
in
my
example.
justice
white
they
want
to
exclude,
they
want
to
prevent
the
amusement
park
operator
from
doing
business
with
people
from
out-of-state.
justice
white
well,
the--
justice
white
is
this
law
subject
to
strict
scrutiny?
justice
white
what
if
it
were?
justice
white
and
why
isn't
it
subject
to
strict
scrutiny?
justice
white
well,
hadn't
the
operator
been
taking
out-of-state
waste?
justice
white
this
was
going
to
be
new
business?
justice
white
so
this
would
just
be
new
business
for
the
landfill
operator?
justice
white
well...
go
ahead.
what
would
happen
under
the
statute
if
he
decided
that
he
couldn't
make
a
profit
without
taking
out-of-state
garbage
and
he
decided
to
close
up
the
dump
entirely?
what
would
the
county
do?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
did
this
landfill
operator,
didn't
he
offer
to,
didn't
he
undertake
to
satisfy
the,
all
of
the
county's--
