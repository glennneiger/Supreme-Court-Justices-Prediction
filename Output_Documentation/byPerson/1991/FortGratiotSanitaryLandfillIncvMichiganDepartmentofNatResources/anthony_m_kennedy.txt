justice
kennedy
but
this
case
is
unlike
the
taylor
and
maine
case,
because
there
the
out-of-state
character
of
the
item
imported
was
itself
the
evil.
here
the
evils
that
you
have
described
apply
in
like
measure
to
in-state
and
out-of-state
garbage.
so
i'm
not
sure
how
persuasive
your
answer
is
to
justice
souter's
question
when
he
asked
you
to
specify
for
us
the
particular
evil,
other
than
you're
saying
it's
the
shear
volume,
but
volume
can
be
measured
by
many
ways
other
than
in-state
and
out-of-state
discrimination.
