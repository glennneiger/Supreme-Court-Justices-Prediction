mr.
thomas
l.
casey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1905
in
the
california
reduction
company
decision
this
court
said
many
of
the
questions
involved
in
municipal
sanitation
have
proved
to
be
difficult
of
solution.
87
years
later
the
problems
are
still
with
us,
and
they
are
still
difficult
of
solution.
michigan
has
attempted
to
address
these
difficult
problems
by
imposing
a
comprehensive,
mandatory,
long
range
planning
and
long
range
management
process
for
solid
waste
which
is
to
be
disposed
of
in
each
county
in
michigan.
petitioner's
claim
is
that
the
commerce
clause
exempts
it
from
even
participating
in
the
planning
process.
petitioner
asks
this
court
to
extend
its
decision
in
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey
and
announce
a
rule
which
would
require
every
county
in
michigan,
presumably
every
county
across
the
nation,
to
absorb
as
much
out-of-county
waste
as
a
landfill
operator
wanted
to
bring
in,
with
no
ability
for
state
or
local
governments
to
have
any
control
over
volumes
and
regardless
of
the
local
circumstances
or
the
local
consequences.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
each
county
creates
a
plan.
there
are
83
counties.
i
believe
eight
of
them
currently
permit
importation
of
out-of-state
waste.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
others
do
not
currently
contain
a
specific
provision
permitting
out-of-state
waste
to
be
brought
in.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
a
state
law
requires
affirmative
action
by
each
county
before
out-of-state
waste
can
be
brought
in.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
is
a
comprehensive
process
for
developing
the
plan
with
input
from
the
local
counties,
local
planning
agencies,
votes
by
the
municipalities
within
a
county,
regional
approval,
and
ultimately
approval
by
the
director
of
the
department
of
natural
resources.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes,
it
can.
the
solid--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--we
are
urging
this
court...
this
case
presents
the
opportunity
for
the
court
to
reexamine
the
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey
decision.
in
that
case
the
court
found
that
solid
waste
was
an
article
of
commerce
and
found
that
a
specific
new
jersey
statute
violated
the
commerce
clause.
as
the
dissent
in
that
case
indicates,
and
as
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
and
in
the
amicus
briefs,
there
are
unique
characteristics
of
solid
waste
which
present
strong
arguments
why
solid
waste
should
not
be
considered
within
the
commerce
clause.
if
the
court--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--we
believe
that
the
judgments
below
can
be
affirmed
without
retreating
whatsoever
from
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey.
we
do
believe,
however,
that
there
are
unique
aspects
of
the
solid
waste
problem
which
should
urge
this
court
to
exert
great
deference
in
reviewing
the
state
statute.
i'd
like
to
talk
about
those
in
a
moment,
but
i
would
like
to
mention
at
the
outset
the
very
narrow
and
limited
posture
of
this
case
before
this
court
today.
in
its
original
complaint
in
the
district
court
petitioner
challenged
the
statute
on
its
face.
count
2
challenged
the
statute
as
applied
by
st.
clair
county,
and
count
3
alleged
due
process
violations.
in
this
court,
however,
they
have
abandoned
everything
except
the
facial
challenge.
they
have
abandoned
their
claim
that
st.
clair
county's
refusal
to
amend
their
plan
was
unconstitutional.
so
the
sole
challenge
in
this
court
is
whether
this
comprehensive
statewide
statute
is
unconstitutional
merely
because
it
permits
each
county
to
consider
local
circumstances
in
deciding
whether
to
permit
or
to
prohibit
out-of-state
waste.
under
petitioner's
view
in
this
facial
challenge
a
county
can
never
prohibit
out-of-state
waste
regardless
of
local
circumstances
or
local
consequences.
our
position
is
that
a
state
may
implement
a
planning
process,
as
we
have
done
here,
which
permits
counties
to
take
into
consideration
of
local
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
we
would
be
probably
taking
a
stronger
position
that
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey
should
be
overruled.
we
believe
that
our
statute
is
significantly
different
than
the
statute
in
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey.
michigan
does,
the
michigan
statute
does
permit
counties
to
accept
waste
from
out-of-state.
eight
of
the
counties
do.
michigan
also
exports
some
waste
to
other
counties.
michigan--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--in
a
facial
challenge
that
would
be
much
more
like
the
statute
that
was
present
in
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey.
if
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey
is
still
good
law
then
the
statute
in
michigan
would
be--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
key
differences
between
our
statute
and
the
statute
in
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey
is
that
in
that
case
there
was
an
absolute
prohibition.
our
statute
does
not
contain
an
absolute
prohibition.
our
statute
sets
up
a
comprehensive
planning
process
for
all
of
the
waste
which
is
to
be
disposed
of
in
a
county
to
be
subjected
to
identification
of
sources,
estimation
of
volumes,
because
the
key
aspect
of
the
michigan
statute
is
that
it
imposes
on
each
county
the
requirement
that
they
guarantee
future
disposal
capacity
for
20
years.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
that
would
be
the
analysis
if
this
were
a
challenge
to
the
statute
as
applied
in
a
particular
circumstance.
what
the
petitioner
is
challenging
is
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
statute
permits
counties
to
make
this
local
evaluation.
if
a
county
prohibited
out-of-state
waste
and
a
petitioner
came
in
and
challenged
that
as
applied
to
if
there
would
be
a
commerce
clause
challenge
there,
we
would
depend
on
local
circumstances.
we
would
get
into
a
detailed
factual
dispute
as
the
court
had
in
maine
v.
taylor
with
an
extensive
evidentiary
record.
this
case
was
decided
on
summary
judgment
with
virtually
no
evidentiary
record
at
all.
and
as
it
is
postured
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
framed
the
question
he
presented
in
the
petition,
it
is
only
a
facial
challenge.
we
submit
the
question
in
this
case
is
can
a
state
ever
permit
local
units
of
government
to
evaluate
local
circumstances--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
that
is
the
question.
can
a
state,
can
any
local
circumstances
ever
justify
a
county
in
excluding
out-of-state
waste?
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that
would
not
be
our
position,
no.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
this
subject
matter
is
fundamentally
different
than
the
typical
economic--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--under
the
traditional
commerce
clause
analysis
you
have
to
determine
the
nature
and
the
legitimacy
of
the
local
concerns.
we
submit
in
this
case
this
is
not
simply
economic
protectionism.
as
the
court
said
in
the
sporhase
decision--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--perhaps
i
didn't
understand
your
example.
i
understood
the,
your
hypothetical
to
be
that
they
wanted
to
exclude
out-of-county
residents
from
using
this
county--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that
probably
would
not
be
a
sufficient
justification
for
making
the
exclusion.
what
you
have
to
look
at
is
the
legitimacy
of
the
local
purpose.
what
we
have
here
is
a
purpose
which
is
clearly
legitimate,
protection
of
the
public
health
and
the
environment.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
key
is
the
means
that
the
state
has
used
to
implement
that
legitimate
purpose.
we
believe
the
means
that
are
used
here
in
this
statute
are
reasonable.
they
are
non-discriminatory,
it
is
not
an
absolute
statewide
prohibition.
in
this
limited
facial
challenge
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
commerce
clause
absolutely
requires
every
county
in
michigan
to
absorb
waste
without
limitation
of
volume
from
all
sources
outside
of
the
county.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
to
some
extent
landfills
always
pose
dangers
to
public
health.
this
michigan
statute
and
the
federal
statutes
do
their
best
to
minimize
that
danger,
but
there
is
always
going
to
be
a
danger.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
applied
strict
scrutiny
in
this
commerce
clause
area
deal
with
simple
economic
protectionism.
we
don't
have
that.
we
have
different--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--there
are
in
the
neighborhood
of
180
million
tons
a
year
of
municipal
solid
waste
generated.
it
has
to
go
somewhere.
statutes
on
the
federal
and
state
level
are
trying
to
encourage
other
types
of
source
separation,
recycling,
composting,
but
the
current
practical
reality
is
there
are
going
to
be
landfills
for
the
foreseeable
future.
landfills
pose
dangers
wherever
they're
located.
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
because
michigan
has
imposed
on
its
county
citizens
the
extreme
burden
of
guaranteeing
future
capacity
for
their
own
incounty
waste,
because
they
have
taken
that
burden
on
themselves
they
therefore
are
entitled
under
the
commerce
clause
to
have
some
limit
in
deciding
their
service
area.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
public
health
dangers
in
the
form
of
leachate,
fluids
that
seep
through
the
landfill
and
are
required
to
be
pumped
out
and
drained.
public
health
dangers
of
methane
gas
which
is
produced
by
these,
pest
animals,
insects,
noise--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--because
of
the
volume
of
solid
waste
which
is
created
throughout
the
country,
measures
have
to
be
taken
somewhere
to
provide
proper
disposal.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
but
under
the
traditional
commerce
clause
analysis
you
look
to
the
nature
and
legitimacy
of
the
public
purpose
which
is
served.
you
look
to
the
legislative
ends
and
the
legislative
means.
the
goal
here
is
to
minimize
environmental
damage
and
minimize
public
health
damage
by
landfills.
st.
clair
county
could
have--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--no.
we
submit
it--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--it
would
still
pass
muster
under
either
the--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--because
it
is
not
facially
discriminatory
to
the
extent
that
the
strict
scrutiny
cases
have
applied
that
standard.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
am
not
sure
i
understand.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
commerce
clause
analysis
that
the
petitioner
has
raised
is
that
the
statute
is
discriminatory,
it
favors
in-county
residents.
we
submit
that
when
you
look
at
the
entire
statute
as
a
whole
as
it
operates
it
does
not
favor
in-county
residents.
in
fact
it
burdens
in-county
residents.
they
are
not
permitted
to
put
their
waste
on
trucks
and
send
it
someplace
else.
they
are
required
to
guarantee
for
the
next
20
years
adequate
landfill
capacity
to
take
care
of
all
of
the
solid
waste
generated
within
that
county.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
but
in
the,
the
point
i'm--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--i
would
analogize
to
the
sporhase
decision.
there
there
was
a
statute
regulating
the
withdrawal
and
transfer
of
groundwater.
the
state
of
nebraska
imposed
restrictions
on
in-state
transfers
and
it
imposed
different
restrictions
on
out-of-state
transfers.
that
was
one
of
the
factors
the
court
looked
at
in
saying
that
that
portion
of
the
statute
was
not
facially
discriminatory,
because
it
imposed
burdens
both
on
in-state
residents
and
out-of-state
residents.
we
submit
the
same
principle
applies
here.
significant
burdens
are
imposed
on
in-county
residents,
and
the
only
burden
that
is
imposed
on
out-of-county
residents,
for
out-of-county
waste,
is
that
they
participate
in
the
planning
process,
but
the
counties,
because
they
have
assumed
the
burden
of
disposing
of
their
own,
are
given
some
ability
to
limit
their
service
area.
in
a
particular
case
if
a
county
did
not
have
sufficient
justification
for
excluding
out-of-county
waste,
a
prohibition
might
be
unconstitutional
as
applied.
we
don't
have
that
challenge
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
if
the
burdens
are
comparable,
then
the
statute--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--we
submit
they
are.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct,
but
the
out-of-state
resident
can
satisfy...
the
problem
of
solid
waste
is
a
local
problem.
it's
generated
at
a
local
level.
some
localities
solve
the
problem
by
putting
it
on
trucks
or
trains
and
shipping
it
away.
when
michigan
has
undertaken
the
burden
to
dispose
of
its
own
waste,
we
submit
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
compel
it
to
provide
unlimited
future
landfill
capacity
for
the
rest
of
the
country
as
well.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
no,
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
the
commerce
clause
does
not
elevate
free
trade
above
all
other
values.
where
there
are
legitimate
public
health
purposes
in
this
statute
protecting
against
the
health
hazards,
and
the
state
has
undertaken
to
address
those
problems
and
has
burdened
itself
with
the
duty
to
provide
its
own
future
landfill
capacity,
we
submit
that
by
assuming
that
burden
they
can
therefore
exercise
some
control.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
if
every
state
had
a
law
like
michigan's,
every
county
would
be
required
to
dispose
of
its
own
solid
waste
and
we
would
not
have
an
interstate
problem.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
they
could
if
the
receiving
state
accepted
that
burden.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
prohibits
any
county
from
accepting
burdens.
the
question
here
is
does
the
commerce
clause
require
them
to
accept
that
burden
when
they
are
already
assuming
the
burden
of
guaranteeing--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--again,
we
have
very
little
in
the
way
of
evidentiary
record
here.
the
only
record
we
have
is
that
the
petitioner
made
a
request
to
the
county
to
amend
its
plan
to
permit
1,750
tons
per
day
of
out-of-county
waste.
a
staff
of
the
county
planning
commission,
staff
group
looked
at
that
and
concluded
that
that
amount
of
additional
waste
would
use
up
all
of
the
capacity
which
the
county
had
planned
for
within
6
years
instead
of
20.
and
at
that
point--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--no.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
had
been
litigation
within
the
state
where
they
were
trying
to
take
out-of-county
waste.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
the
fort
gratiot
landfill
is
included
within
the
county
plan.
the
county
plan
estimates
all
of
the
waste
which
will
be
generated
within
the
county,
identifies
the
sources,
estimates
the
volumes.
they
are
required
to
assure
proper
disposal
for
a
20-year
period,
and
they
have
included
the
fort
gratiot
landfill
in
that.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
if
he
could
make
that
showing
in
a
challenge
to
the
statute
as
applied--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--correct.
but
a
challenge
by
him
on
those
facts
could
succeed.
a
similar
challenge
has
succeeded.
we
cited
the
dafter
township
opinion
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
where
precisely
that
situation
occurred.
the
township
sued
a
landfill
operator
who
wanted
to
bring
in
out-of-county
waste
which
was
not
included
in
the
county
plan.
the
landfill
operator
was
able
to
demonstrate
that
the,
bringing
in
this
additional
amount
would
not
impair
the
county's
capacity,
and
therefore
the
injunction
was
denied.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
county
would
have
to
find
some
alternative
method
of
assuring
disposal.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that
is
the
obligation--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--no.
there
are
obligations
in
closing--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
county
would
still
have
to
solve
the
problem,
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
don't
know
if
the
county
could
do
that
on
its
own
because
the
statute
requires
them
to
assure
capacity--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--correct.
correct.
the
commerce
clause
would
permit
the
state
of
michigan
to
say
no
landfills
anywhere.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
in
the
proposal
that
he
submitted
he
said
that,
the
county
said...
the
company
said
it
would
guarantee
the
full
20-year
capacity.
the
staff
looked
at
that
same
proposal
and
said
no,
there
is
only,
there
would
only
be
6
years
that
would
use
it
up.
that's
a
fact
dispute.
if
they
had
pursued
their
as
applied
challenge
and
he
could
show
that
st.
clair
county
impermissibly
was
restricting
out-of-state
waste
for
protectionist
purposes,
to
hoard
their
own
limited
capacity,
he
might
succeed
on
an
as-applied
challenge.
but
we
have
here,
the
simple
question
that's
before
the
court
today
is
where
the
county,
or
the
state
of
michigan
and
its
counties
have
assumed
this
burden
of
taking
care
of
their
own
waste,
guaranteeing
their
own
future
capacity
for
20
years,
does
the
commerce
clause
require
every
county
also
to
assume
the
burden
of
disposing
in
the
future
of
as
much
waste
as
the
landfill
operator
wants
to
bring
in?
we
say
it
does
not.
in
the
balancing
of
local
interests
and
the
national
interest
in
free
markets,
this
statute
is
a
reasonable
regulation.
it
is
not
an
absolute
prohibition.
it
is,
it
applies
even-handedly
because--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--there
were
four
very
limited
exceptions,
but--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
governor
or
whoever
the
official
was
passed
a
regulation
with
four
exceptions,
but
the
court
said--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--in
a
facial
challenge
such
as
this
what
we're
saying
is
that
it
is
permissible
for
a
state
statute
to
let
local
governments
evaluate
local
circumstances.
if
the
local
circumstances
are
such
that
they
cannot
accommodate
out-of-state
waste,
then
the
commerce
clause
does
not
require
that
county
to
accept
the
out-of-state
waste.
that
would
require
a
challenge
as
applied.
what
we
have
here
is
a
facial
challenge,
and
the
question
is
can
a
state
statute
ever
permit
a
county
to
evaluate
its
own
local
circumstances
and
make
its
decision
based
on
those
local
circumstances
and
local
consequences.
if
a
particular
challenge
was
made
a
prohibition
such
as
st.
clair
county's
might
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
in
a
particular
case,
but
on
the
facts
that
we
have
here
and
the
very
narrow
limited
challenge
it
simply
cannot
be
said
that
the
michigan
statute
unreasonably
impairs
interstate
commerce.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
no.
the
petitioner
filed
motions
for
summary
judgment.
the
court
denied
those
and
entered
judgments
for
the
respondents
on
all
counts.
but
there
was
no
trial.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
it
was
on
a
summary
judgment
motion.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
pike
test,
and
in
the
traditional
application
of
the
pike
test
they
found
there
was
no
facial
discrimination.
we
reject
the
petitioner's
characterization
that
there
is
some
new
principle
being
espoused
here.
we
submit
there
is
not.
in
summary
we
submit
this
is
a
reasonable
regulation
that
does
not
unduly
interfere
with
interstate
commerce,
but
it
does
permit
protection
of
the
public
health.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
thank
you.
