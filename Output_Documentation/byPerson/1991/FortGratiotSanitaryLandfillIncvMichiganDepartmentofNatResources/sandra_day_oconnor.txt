justice

is
the
waste,
could
it
ever
be
said
to
be
hazardous
to
transport
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
would
that
aspect
of
it
possibly
bring
it
in
the
quarantine
exception?
justice
o'connor
mr.
finn,
i
guess
the
sixth
circuit
purported
to
apply
the
pike
v.
bruce
church
test
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
and
do
you
make
the
argument
that
it
was,
that
was
the
wrong
test
to
apply,
or
that
it
was
the
correct
test
to
apply
but
they
applied
it
wrong?
what
is
it
you're
arguing?
justice
o'connor
but
to
the
extent
that
the
county
tried
to
do
that
and
imposed
the
tax
on
its
own
citizens
as
well,
i
imagine
it
wouldn't
sit
too
well
to
be
told
that
the
county
was
going
to
recoup
some
of
the
money.
justice
o'connor
people
who
live
there
and
who
vote
there
still
have
to
get
rid
of
their
garbage,
don't
they?
justice
o'connor
and
they
want
to
do
it
at
reasonable
rates,
i
suppose.
justice
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
this.
do
you
think
that
solid
waste
has
today
a
commercial
value
in
part?
are
there
things
included
in
solid
waste
today
that
make
it
potentially
a
valuable
item?
justice
o'connor
mr.
finn,
could
michigan
put
together
a
scheme
whereby
the
counties
could
decide
that
they
wouldn't
allow
any
private
landfills,
period,
and
that
all
waste
disposal
would
be
at
county-owned
sites?
justice
o'connor
and
if
they
did
that
and
then
said
no
out-of-state
waste,
i
guess
you
wouldn't
win.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
and
approval
by
the
state.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
mr.
casey,
does
the
state
take
the
position
that
the
transportation
of
solid
waste
presents
significant
health
or
safety
dangers?
justice
o'connor
is
that
a
position
taken
by
the
state
here
to
justify
its
position?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
we
disagree
with
that
and
leave
the
precedents
on
the
books,
then
where
are
you?
