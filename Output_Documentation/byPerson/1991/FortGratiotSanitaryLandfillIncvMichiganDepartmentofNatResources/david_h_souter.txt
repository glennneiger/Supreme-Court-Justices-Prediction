justice
souter
what
if
the
county
in
this
case
had
combined
its
embargo
with
a
temporal
limitation,
let's
say
5
years
or
10
years,
and
had
justified
that,
assuming
it
could
do
so,
on
the
ground
that
it
takes
that
long
to
engage
in
responsible
planning
and
construction
of
further
facilities,
so
that
it
justified
it
essentially
on
the
basis
of
a
planning
purpose,
expressly
and
overtly?
could
they
do
that?
justice
souter
no,
but
i
mean
in
the
classic
sort
of
case.
that's
not
going
to
apply
to
the
question
whether
or
not
we
ought
to
let
in
foreign
milk.
i
mean
it's
either
going
to
be
consumed
or
not
consumed
by
the
market.
that's
going
to
take
care
of
it.
but
in
this
case
there,
i
assume
there
is
a
legitimate
argument
to
be
made
that
you
can't
in
effect
create
a
landfill
overnight,
and
that
it
is
at
least
reasonable
for
people
to
take
measures
to
prevent
having
to
send
their
garbage
to
south
dakota.
would
that
(a)
take
it
out
of
the
category
of
heightened
scrutiny,
and
(b)
would
it
be
a
reasonable
basis
on
a
balancing
test
for
allowing
a,
at
least
a
temporal
limitation?
justice
souter
--we
do
have
to
have
a
sense,
don't
we,
even
as
you
have
posed
the
issue
before
us,
of
the
kinds
of
interest
that,
the
kinds
of
local
interest
that
it
would
be
legitimate
to
assert,
that
might
reasonably
be
asserted?
one
of
them,
or
maybe
the
one
that
you
have
just
described
to
us,
is
a
concern
over
public
health.
and
i'm
not
sure
exactly,
when
you
get
beyond
that,
how
that
concern
is
to
be
expressed.
i
take
it
you
don't
take
the
position
that
it
is
impossible
to
run
a
landfill
without
a
threat
to
public
health,
do
you?
justice
souter
all
right,
well
how
are
we
supposed
to
kind
of
get
our
hands
on
the
kind
of
public
health
concern
which
you
say
at
least
facially,
on
a
facial
challenge
might
justify
the
restriction?
i
mean,
to
be
candid
with
you,
all
we've
got
is
kind
of
a
slogan,
public
health,
protect
public
health,
and
i
don't
know
where
we
go
when
we
get
beyond
that.
justice
souter
no,
that
may
be,
but
how
do
you
articulate
your
public
health
interest?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
i
will
assume
that
there
is
a
public
health
motivation,
but
i
want
to
have
some
sense...
as
you
pose
the
case
to
us,
i
want
to
have
some
sense
of
what
the
legitimate
concerns
might
be
that
therefore
should
be
allowed,
the
possibility
of
which
should
be
allowed
to
prevail
over
the
facial
challenge.
what
are
they?
justice
souter
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
raised
two
issued
but
you
haven't
answered
the
question.
the
first
issue
is
why
does
the
decision
of
the
state
of
michigan
to
impose
this
burden
on
their
citizens
make
it
somehow
affect
the
commerce
clause
analysis?
and
number
two,
it
still
is
an
open
question
in
my
mind
as
to
exactly
what
the
public
health
hazards
are,
given
the
present
state
of
solid
waste
technology,
that
we
should
consider
as
at
least
possible
justifications
in
response
to
a
facial
challenge.
so
you...
i
still
think
you've
got
two
questions.
why
is
it
at
all
relevant
that
michigan
has
allocated
responsibility
the
way
it
has.
and
number
two,
leaving
that
aside,
what
are
the
public
health
dangers
that
we're
supposed
to
consider
as
possibilities
in
responding
to
this
challenge?
justice
souter
those
are
good
arguments
for
saying
solid
waste
disposal
sites
are
not
desirable
neighbors.
i
mean,
we'll
accept
that.
they
may
be
good
arguments
for
saying
in
a
perfect
world
we
wouldn't
have
them.
but
why
do,
how
do
they
rise
to
a
point
of
clarity
to
allow
us
to
consider
them
in
deciding
this
case?
justice
souter
mr.
casey,
may
i
go
back
to
one
of
the
questions
that
we
have
left
dangling
here?
do
you
take
the
position
that
michigan's
allocation
of
responsibility
is
in
anyway
relevant
to
the
commerce
clause
analysis?
justice
souter
well,
you
began
to
answer
a
previous
question
of
mine
by
saying
that
somehow
it
is
reasonable
to
give
the
counties
the
kind
of
leeway
that
you
want
to
give
them
because
the
state
has
allocated
to
the
counties
the
responsibility
for
finding,
or
for
establishing,
i
guess,
disposal
sites
for,
at
least
for
their
own
county
wastes.
and
my...
i
think
that's
what
you
were
telling
me.
and
my
question
is
isn't
that
a
problem
for
the
state
of
michigan?
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
the
commerce
clause
analysis?
justice
souter
now
i
take
it
you
agree
with
mr.
finn
that
the
county
could
do
that
simply
by
prohibiting
landfills,
or
by
going
into
the
landfill
business
itself
and
in
that
instance
could
prohibit
out-of-state
receipt?
justice
souter
well,
there's
not
comment
that
there
would
be...
i
assume
you
agree
there
would
be
no
commerce
clause
bar
to
its
doing
so
if
that
were
otherwise
the
political
disposition
of
the
state?
