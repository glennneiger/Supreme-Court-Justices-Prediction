justice
scalia
mr.
finn,
isn't
it
really
a
little
unrealistic
to
say
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
an
article
of
commerce
called
garbage?
isn't
the
article
of
commerce
landfill
space?
isn't
that
what's
being
bought
and
sold?
justice
scalia
nobody
wants
garbage.
what
they
want
is
landfill
space.
and
why
should,
why
isn't
that
the
correct
way
to
look
at
the
case?
justice
scalia
but
the
landfill
space
is
just
in
st.
clair
county,
right?
justice
scalia
now
i
suppose,
i
suppose
st.
clair
county
could
impose
an
enormous
tax
upon
any
garbage
brought
into
this
landfill
space.
justice
scalia
it
would
have
the
same
result,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
of
course
all
the
tax
goes
into
st.
clair
county's
own
coffers,
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
would
not
deter
st.
clair
county
from
using
the
landfill.
it
would
just
deter
everybody
else
from
using
the
landfill.
that's
precisely
the
same
result.
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
--so
all
you're
making
st.
clair
county
do
is
to
reduce
its
business
taxes
and
impose
an
enormous
tax
on
taking
stuff
to
the
landfill.
justice
scalia
well,
it's
not
just--
justice
scalia
--i
assume
that
it
also
means
that
the,
that
what
you
can
charge
the
state
today,
or
what
any
existing
landfill
can
charge
the
state
or
in-state
citizens
or
in-county
citizens
has
to
be
lower,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
if
you
could
accept
material
from
out-of-state,
presumably
the
price
would
go
up,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
that
sounds
like
protectionism
to
me.
justice
scalia
but
you
have
to
take
responsibility
for
what
your
counties
do
under
your
authorization,
and
in
fact
it
is
a
total
prohibition
with
respect
to
some
of
the
counties.
and
they're
doing
that
under
your
state
power,
so
it's
a
total
prohibition
into
some
areas
of
the
state.
justice
scalia
in
such
manner
as
to
exclude
out-of-state
garbage--
justice
scalia
--while
still
receiving
in-county
garbage.
justice
scalia
well,
we
don't
care,
we
don't
care
if
you
discriminate
against
county
residents.
that--
justice
scalia
--you
can
be
as
unfair
as
you
like
to
your
state
citizens
and
the
federal
government
doesn't
care.
it's
only
when
you're
unfair
to
out-of-state
citizens,
and
that's
the
issue
here.
justice
scalia
it
isn't
enough
to
impose
some
burden
on
intrastate,
on
state
residents.
it
has
to
be
the
same
burden,
doesn't
it?
i
can't
say
well,
i'm
taxing
my
state
residents
and
i
don't
tax
out-of-state
people,
and
therefore
i
can
do,
you
know,
therefore
i
can
prevent
out-of-state
people
from
bringing
their
garbage
into
this
state.
justice
scalia
but
they
aren't
comparable.
justice
scalia
how
are
they?
your
county
resident
can
dispose
of
the
trash
in
the
county
landfill.
the
out-of-state
resident
can't.
justice
scalia
the
commerce
clause
says
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
local
problem,
doesn't
it?
isn't
that
basically
what
the
commerce
clause
says?
justice
scalia
is
that
a
facial
challenge
to
the
act,
or
is
it
a
facial
challenge
to
the
act
plus
the
st.
clair
implementation
of
the
act?
justice
scalia
what
are
you
facially
challenging?
the
michigan--
justice
scalia
--so
yours
is
not
just
a
facial
challenge
to
the
whole
michigan
statute,
it's
a
facial
challenge
to
the
michigan
statute
with
the
st.
clair
ordinance
implementing?
justice
scalia
--well,
a
state...
we
had
this
problem
in
the
last
case.
the
state
legislatures
don't
elect
their
senators
anymore.
