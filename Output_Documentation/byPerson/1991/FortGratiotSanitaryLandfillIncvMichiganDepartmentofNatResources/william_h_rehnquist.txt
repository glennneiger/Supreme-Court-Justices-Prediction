chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-636,
fort
gratiot
sanitary
landfill
v.
the
michigan
department
of
natural
resources.
mr.
finn,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
up
by
port
huron?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
garbage
is
your
element
of
commerce
here,
i
guess?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
matter
with
it?
you
attack
it
verbally,
but
will
you
explain
why
you
think
it
isn't
consistent
with
our
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
dare
say
lots
of
people
would
think
they
weren't.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
finn,
i
think
some
of
our
cases
have
said
that
when
the
motive
of
the
state
appears
to
be
protectionist,
parochial
favoring
local
industry,
then
we're
going
to
give
it
strict
scrutiny.
what
is
the
local
industry
that
you
think
is
being
favored
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
the,
that
is
the
protectionist
aspect?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
certainly
a
good
deal
different
than
a
lot
of
cases
that
we've--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
the
madison,
the
dean
milk
case
was
a
case
where
the,
i
think
the
city
of
madison
was
trying
to
assure
that
a
particular
local
processing
plant
got
the
business
and
not
somewhere
else,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you...
i
don't
see
the
same
protectionist
element
in
this
case
as
there
was
in
the
dean
milk
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
they're
not
trying
to
protect
a
local
business.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
new
jerseyans
end
up
shipping
their
garbage
to
st.
clair
county,
and
st.
clair
county
ends
up
shipping
its
garbage
to
south
dakota?
i
mean,
when
the
spaces
are
all
gone
in
st.
clair
county.
chief
justice
rehnquist
because
there
is
no
threat
from
the
garbage.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
not
anywhere
in
the
strictly
soil
sense.
you
can't
have
a
landfill
just
anywhere
you
choose,
can
you?
it
has
to
be
a
particular
kind
of
soil,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
it
has
to
be
sited
away
from
certain
other
things.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
casey.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
in
this
case,
mr.
casey,
the
michigan
statute
by
name
said
these
eight
counties
shall
be
able
to
import
waste
and
the
others
shall
not.
would
that
make
it
any
different
a
case
for
constitutional
purposes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
would
be
much
more
like
it
in
the
sense
that
it
was
more
like
the
pennsylvania
statute,
or
the
new
jersey
statute
there.
but
is
that
distinction
significant
for
constitutional
purposes,
is
that
difference,
the
fact
that
the
state,
that
it's
the
state
that
decides
whether
or
not
a
county
will
import
garbage
rather
than
the
county
itself?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
district
court
here
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
respondents
here,
i
mean
to
the
petitioner
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
in
effect
it
was
giving
you
the
benefit,
it
was
resolving
all
disputed
facts
against
you,
i
take
it
then?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
then
the
sixth
circuit
sent
it,
the
sixth
circuit
upheld
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
casey.
mr.
finn,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
garbage
is
coming
all
the
way
from
connecticut
to
michigan?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
mean
that
was
the
proposal,
to
bring
garbage
in--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
finn.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-636,
fort
gratiot
sanitary
landfill
versus
michigan
department
of
natural
resources
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
