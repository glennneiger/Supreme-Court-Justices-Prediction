justice
stevens
mr.
casey,
you
point
out
that
in
some
communities
they
put
the
garbage
on
trains
or
trucks
and
ship
it
away.
if
every
state
in
the
united
states
had
the
same
law
that
michigan
had,
would
that
still
be
possible?
justice
stevens
and
if
it
found
that
it
could
do
it
much
more
cheaply
by
putting
it
on
a
train
and
shipping
it
to
some
area
where
the
land
is
very
cheap
and
there's
a
lot
of
desert
or
something,
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
that,
would
they?
justice
stevens
why
does,
why
does
st.
clair
county
really
want
to
forbid
this
private
landfill
operator
from
processing
or
disposing
of
out-of-state
waste?
justice
stevens
it's
still
true,
as
i
understand,
that
if
he
could
demonstrate
that
he
could
still
handle
all
the
local
garbage
for
the
next
20
years
the
law
would
still
prohibit
him
from
taking
any
out-of-state
garbage.
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
not,
i'm
not
worrying
about
constitutionality,
just
the
way
it
would
work.
if
he
could
demonstrate
that
he
has
this
tremendous
capacity
that
could
handle
both
the
out-of-state
garbage
and
the
local
garbage
for
the
next
50
years,
the
statute
would
still
prohibit
him
from
taking
the
out-of-state
garbage.
justice
stevens
he
has
no
obligation
to
serve
the
county
for
the
next
20
years.
justice
stevens
so
that
if
he
rents
his
space
to
an
out-of-state
customer
it
has
the
same
impact
on
the
county
as
if
he
just
closed
up?
the
county
still
has
to
solve
the
problem.
justice
stevens
--of
course
there
wasn't
an
absolute
prohibition
in
the
new
jersey
case
either,
was
there?
justice
stevens
but
they
were
whatever
exceptions
the
agency
wanted
to
allow,
and
they
allowed
for.
justice
stevens
just
as
here
a
county
can
allow
out-of-state
garbage
if
it
wants
to.
it's
the
same
kind
of
loophole
if
they
want
to
take
advantage
of
it,
if
the
government
wants
to
take
advantage
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
waste
import
restrictions
of
michigan
solid
waste
management
act
provide
that
solid
waste
generated
in
another
county,
state,
or
country
cannot
be
accepted
for
disposal
in
any
michigan
county
unless
such
disposal
is
specifically
authorized
in
that
county's
solid
waste
management
plan.
petitioner,
the
operator
of
a
privately
owned
landfill
in
st.
clair
county,
michigan
asked
the
county
for
permission
to
accept
out
of
state
waste
but
the
county
declined
the
request.
petitioner
then
filed
this
action
seeking
a
judgment
declaring
the
waste
import
restrictions
invalid
under
the
commerce
clause
and
enjoining
their
enforcement.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
finding
no
facial
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
because
the
restrictions
do
not
treat
out
of
county
waste
from
michigan
any
differently
from
waste
from
other
states.
the
court
of
appeals
also
concluded
that
the
statute
does
not
discriminate
in
actual
effect
because
petitioner
has
not
alleged
that
all
michigan
counties
ban
out
of
state
waste.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
waste
import
restrictions
clearly
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
since
they
authorize
each
county
to
isolate
itself
from
the
national
economy
and
afford
local
waste
producer's
complete
protection
from
out
of
state
producers
seeking
to
use
local
waste
disposal
areas
unless
a
county
acts
affirmatively
to
authorize
such
use.
the
fact
that
the
waste
import
restrictions
treat
waste
from
other
michigan
counties
no
differently
from
waste
from
other
states
does
not
qualify
their
discriminatory
character.
for
our
cases
teach
that
a
state
may
not
avoid
the
strictures
of
the
commerce
clause
by
curtailing
the
movement
of
articles
of
commerce
through
subdivisions
of
the
state
rather
than
through
the
state
itself.
nor
are
we
persuaded
that
the
michigan
statute
constitutes
a
comprehensive
health
and
safety
regulation
rather
than
economic
protectionism
of
the
state's
limited
landfill
capacity.
respondents
have
provided
no
valid
health
and
safety
reasons
for
limiting
the
amount
of
waste
that
a
landfill
operator
may
accept
from
outside
the
state
but
not
the
amount
the
operator
may
accept
from
inside
the
state.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined.
