mr.
michael
g.
logan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
diane
griffin
was
convicted
in
a
single
count
in
23
counts
of
an
indictment
centering
around
a
major
drug
prosecution
in
chicago.
in
the
count
in
which
she
was
charged,
there
were
two
objects
of
this
conspiracy.
during
the
trial,
and
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case,
it
became
clear,
as
a
lawyer,
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
as
presented
by
the
government
and
the
dea
object.
at
that
time,
griffin
made
a
motion
for
a
directed
finding.
the
government
made
argument,
and
during
that
argument
conceded
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
on
that
object.
at
that
time,
griffin
made
a
motion
for
a
severance
for
reasons
that
i
set
out
in
the
briefs.
at
the
end
of
the
entire
case,
the
evidence
really
didn't
change.
and
prior
to
submission
of
the
instructions
to
the
jury,
griffin
asked
for
several
things.
one
of
the
things
that
she
asked
for
was
that
the
insufficient
object
be
removed
from
the
jury's
consideration.
and
she
submitted
a
jury
instruction
that
did
just
that.
that
instruction
was
denied.
as
an
alternative,
she
submitted
a
set
of
special
interrogatories,
wherein
the
jury
would
have
told
the
court
which
of
the
two
objects
the
jury
was
using
as
a
basis
for
the
finding
of
guilt
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
finding
of
guilt.
those
instructions
were
also
denied.
at
the
end
of
the
jury's
deliberation,
there
was
a
finding
of
guilty.
it
was
a
general
verdict.
and
i
submit
to
this
court,
i
submitted
to
the
court
at
the
time,
i
submitted
it
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that
to
this
day
we
do
not
know
upon
which
basis...
which
of
the
objects
this
jury
decided
guilt.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
exactly
the
point.
because
we
follow
the
presumption
the
jury
follows
its
instructions,
because
we
believe
that
and
we
follow
that
presumption,
we
do
not
know
because
in
the
instructions
there
was
error.
the
error
was
that
the
jury
was
allowed
to
use
the
basis
that
was
insufficiently
proven
as
a
basis
for
guilt.
and
this
is
a
case
where
there
was
evidence
concerning
knowledge
of
the
drug
prosecution,
of
the
drug
dealing.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
well,
i
believe
that
approach
makes
sense
if
you
believe
that
the
jury
can
recognize
the
legal
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
and
it's
our
view
in
this
case,
and
i'm
asking
this
court
to
follow
that
view,
that
juries
do
not
always
recognize
legal
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
the
trial
lawyer
in
this
case,
and
i
tried
this
case,
recognized
that
legal
insufficiency.
the
government
conceded
the
legal
insufficiency.
the
court
agreed
with
both
sides
that
it
was
legally
insufficient.
however,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
there
was
evidence
concerning...
circumstantial
evidence...
concerning
connection
between
diane
griffin
and
the
dea
object.
for
instance,
the
government
brought
in
evidence
that
she
lived
with
the
kingpin
of
this
major
drug
conspiracy;
brought
in
evidence
that
she
knew
the
major
wholesale
supplier
of
drugs
in
the
case,
mr.
suarez.
there
was
evidence
in
the
case
that
when
mr.
suarez
came
in
for
the
first
time
to
meet
mr.
beverly,
he
had
to
go
through
diane
griffin.
diane
griffin
knew
all
of
the
personalities
at
trial,
all
of
the
other
defendants
in
trial,
including
minor...
relatively
minor...
personalities
like
jim
dandy.
so
there
was
an
association.
and
i
liken
this
situation,
your
honors,
to
that
in
cramer.
in
cramer
v.
united
states,
the
defendant
in
that
case
knew
fiel.
he
knew
these
german
conspirators.
he
met
with
them.
and
i
think
as
the
opinion
says--
mr.
michael
g.
logan
--there
was
some
evidence.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
insufficient
evidence.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
they
actively
opposed
it.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
well,
the
government
did--
mr.
michael
g.
logan
--the
evidence
told...
the
government
told
the
jury
that
they
could
convict
on
either.
in
closing
arguments
to
the
jury...
the
prosecutor,
in
closing
argument,
told
the
jury
that
diane
griffin
was
charged
with
the
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
dea
and
the
irs.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
in
what
way,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
g.
logan
the
court
also
thought
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence.
there
was
a--
mr.
michael
g.
logan
--well,
i
would
disagree.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
no,
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
the
court,
if
you
please.
the
court
rules
as
a
matter
of
law
when
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
i
made
a
motion
for
judgment.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
that
is
true.
the
court
did
not
grant
my
motion.
i
don't
know
why
the
court
didn't
grant
me
partial
judgment
of
acquittal.
the
seventh
circuit
said
the
same
thing
in
their
opinion.
they
said
they
didn't
know
why
the
district
court
didn't
grant
partial
summary
judgment
in
this
case.
it
was
there.
the
evidence
concerning
the
association
of
griffin
with
the
drugs
is
all
evidence
of
association,
and
that's
why
i
point
out
the
cramer
case.
it's
very
similar
to
cramer.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
yes,
i
do.
however,
the
term
itself
is
as
misleading.
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
if
there
were
a
small
amount
of
evidence
or
if
there
is
no
evidence
at
all,
i
think,
then,
at
that
point,
the
court
could
say,
yes,
they
only
decided
on
the
evidence
where
there...
on
the
case,
on
the
object...
where
there
was
evidence,
where
there
was
sufficient
evidence
for
a
conviction.
but
in
griffin's
case
what
we
have
is
a
major
drug
prosecution.
in
essence,
this
is
a
drug
case.
the
government
attempted
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
to
convict
griffin
on
the
drug
arm
of
this
particular
count.
what
happened
during
the
case
was
that
at
a
critical
point
when
the
witness,
according
to
the
proffer,
was
going
to
say
that
griffin
was
party
to
a
drug
conversation...
the
witness
testified
that
the
two
men
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
bar
and
had
a
private
conversation
concerning
the
distribution
of
drugs,
while
griffin
was
left
alone.
but
despite
that
fact,
the
government
insisted
that
they
were
going
to
maintain
this
opportunity
to
have
the
jury
consider
the
drug
evidence
against
griffin.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
well,
i'm
puzzled
by
that
myself.
i
don't
understand
why
the
court
sent
it
to
the
jury.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
well,
on
that
point,
your
honor,
we
have
the
district
court's
written
opinion
where
the
district
court
says
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence.
the
court
did
not--
mr.
michael
g.
logan
--well,
i
think
that's
why
i'm
here
today,
your
honor.
that's
the
issue.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
if
i
might,
on
the
jury
instructions,
the
court
directly
instructed
this
jury
according
to
the
statute,
and
the
statutes
reads
if
there
is
a
defrauding
of
the
united
states
or
either
of
its
agencies...
or
any
of
its
agencies...
you
may
find
guilt.
so
there
was
a
jury
instruction
from
the
court
that
allowed
the
jury--
mr.
michael
g.
logan
--well,
in
the
instruction
there
were
three
names:
mr.
beverly,
betty
mcnulty,
and
diane
griffin.
there
was
no
distinction
between
those
three
defendants,
and
that's
part
of
our
position
in
this
case.
there
should
have
been
a
distinction
between
those
individuals
because
diane
griffin
could
not
be
lumped
with
alex
beverly
and
betty
mcnulty.
the
evidence
in
their
cases
was
sufficient
for
them
to
be
convicted
by
the
jury
on
the
drug
enforcement
administration
aspect
of
the
case.
but
with
respect
to
griffin,
admittedly
it
was
not.
so
she
should
not
have
been
lumped
there.
the
judge
should
have
not
instructed
the
jury,
yes,
you
may
convict
on
the
dea
object
of
this
conspiracy.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
yes.
the
prosecutor
in
closing
argument
said
that
the...
all
three
defendants
by
name
were
charged
with
the
dea
object
and
with
the
irs
object.
when
i
got
up
and--
mr.
michael
g.
logan
--yes.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
yes.
because
the
prosecutor
named
all
three
and
said
specifically
that
all
three
were
charged
with
those
two
objects.
it
made
no
differentiation
between
griffin
and
the
other
two
defendants
in
the
case.
in
my
closing
argument,
i
said
to
this
jury
the
government
is
not
going
to
stand
back
up
in
rebuttal
argument
and
tell
you
that
there
is
evidence
in
this
case
that
says
that
griffin
is
guilty
on
the
dea
object
of
this
conspiracy.
lo
and
behold,
the
government
did
get
up
and
say
that
griffin
saw
drugs.
it's
at
that
point,
after
several
more
words
were
said,
that
i
understood
the
actual
words
of
the
prosecutor
because
she
said
it
so
fast.
and
at
the
next
break,
i
objected
to
that.
the
prosecutor
got
up
and
made
a
retraction
with
regard
to
the
evidence
being
that
diane
griffin
saw
drugs.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
all
right.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
turner
approach
to
the
case
and
said
that
turner
applies
here.
where
there
is
insufficient
evidence,
and
that's
the
insufficiency,
turner
applies.
if
this
case
had
been
one
of
unconstitutionality--
mr.
michael
g.
logan
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
generally
speaking,
i
don't
believe
that
it
would.
i
think
that
if
you
have
a
case
like
cramer,
where
the
requirement
is
that
the
defendant
be
found
guilty
of
committing
one
of
the
overt
acts
and
be
witnessed
by
two
people,
where
the
statute
specifically
says
that,
i
think
that
it
would
apply.
but
generally
speaking,
i
do
not
think
it
would
apply
because
you're
talking
about
overt
acts
which
support
a
particular
object,
and
the
object
is
the
end.
it's
the
purpose.
so
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
go
to
the
overt
acts
unless
the
statute
was
the
focus...
the
statute
focused
on
the
overt
acts.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
because
what
we're
looking
to
is
an
essential
element.
as
i
believe
ingram
v.
united
states
points
out,
it's
an
essential
element
that
there
be
evidence,
sufficient
evidence,
of
an
object,
to
be
knowledge
of
an
object.
and
this...
the
overt
acts
may
support
that
there
are
pieces
of
evidence
that
may
support
that
object,
but
i
don't
believe
that
this
argument
goes
to
the
question
of
overt
acts.
in
this
case,
in
my
case,
the
jury
had
to
find
one,
only
one,
object.
there
wasn't
any
question
of
that.
they
had
to
find
the
internal
revenue
service
object,
decide
the
case
on
that.
if
there
happened
to
be
overt
acts
below
it,
which
as
matters
of
evidence
supported
that
object,
i
think
the
final
issue
rests
on
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
the
object
as
the
end,
as
the
final
purpose
of
the
conspiracy.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
it
in
that
way.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
no,
i
don't.
i
think
that
turner
v.
united
states
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
did
not
address
the
issue
of
where
we
do
not
know.
in
turner
v.
united
states,
there
were
three
acts.
what
the
court
did
in
considering
those
three
acts
is
say
that
the
only
evidence
in
the
case,
and
this
is
an
important
point,
the
only
evidence
in
the
case
was
evidence
of
possession.
and
the
court
equated
possession
with
purchase.
and
that
was
one
of
the
three
acts.
so
the
court
knew
it
was
not
a
situation
where
someone
had
to
guess
which
of
the
two.
the
other
two
acts
were
distribution,
i
believe,
and
sale.
and
they
were
separate...
separate
theories.
but
there
wasn't
any
evidence
in
the
case
except
the
possession.
the
court
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
possession
equated
with
purchase,
and
therefore,
knew
where
the
jury
was
going
by
reason
of
its
analysis.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
well,
i'm
only
asking
the
court
to
apply
the
rule
that
i'm
seeking
if
we
do
not
know.
in
turner,
the
court
knew.
there
was
no
question
that
there
was...
there's
no
question
in
the
case
that
the
evidence
did
not
apply
to
distribution,
the
evidence
did
not
apply
to
sale.
the
evidence
only
applied
to
purchase.
that's
what
the
court
said.
the
court
never
said
in
turner
we
don't
know
what
the
jury
decided
in
this
case.
so
the
rule
in
turner
is
not
a
rule
that
affects
a
situation
where
you
do
not
know.
the
cases
that
follow
turner
have
taken
the
words
of
turner
and
have
turned
it
in
to
that
type
of
rule,
but
turner
originally
did
not
on
its
facts
turn,
if
you
will,
on
not
knowing.
it
was
not
that
kind
of
case.
you
notice
in
turner,
which
is
a
1970
case,
the
court
never
makes
reference
to
stromberg.
it
never
makes
reference
to
cramer.
it
never
makes
reference
to
yates
v.
the
united
states,
all
which
preceded
it.
why?
because
they
didn't
have
to.
they
knew
which
act
the
jury
found.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
i
think
that
would
be
correct.
i
think
that
there
were
no--
mr.
michael
g.
logan
--i
think
that
that's
an
approach
that
this
court
can
take.
i'm
not
necessarily
urging
the
court
to
take
that
approach,
but
i
think
the
court
could
do
it.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
well,
i
believe...
yes,
your
honor,
in
crain,
it
was
early
decided
that
when
acts
are
pled
in
the
conjunctive
they're
considered
to
be
pled
in
the
disjunctive,
so
they
would
always
come
across
as
or
situations.
my
point
here
is
that
we
had
an
or
situation
right
from
the
beginning
because
of
the
jury
instruction
that
was
submitted
to
the...
by
the
court
to
the
jury.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
yes,
i
do.
and
i
think
that's
supported
by
richardson
v.
marsh,
and
i
think
we
have
to
take
that
approach.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
i
think
if
the
jury
instruction
said
you
must
find
guilt
on
a
and
b
to
this
jury,
i
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
then
they
would
have
had
to
find
both,
and
i
wouldn't
be
standing
before
this
court.
the
point
is
it
went
up
in
the
disjunctive.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
well,
no,
your
honor,
because
if
they
had
found
b
in
this
case,
that
would
have
been
sufficient.
if
we
knew
that
they
found
b.
if
we
knew
they
found
her
guilty
on
the
internal
revenue
service
object,
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
question.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
that's
right.
i
agree.
but
it
wasn't
presented
to
them
in
that
manner.
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
case
is
a
case
in
which
all
of
the
money,
all
of
the
property
that
became
the
property
of
diane
griffin
is
drug
based.
in
other
words,
what
the
jury
heard
in
this
case
is
that
the
proceeds,
at
least
from
the
evidence
that
the
government
provided,
the
money
came
from
drug
proceeds.
diane
griffin
is
receiving
the
money
that's
the
flow
from
these
drug
proceeds.
so
we
have
that
constant
connection
between
her
and
the
drug
evidence.
and
i
think
at
this
point
what
we
are
saying
here,
because
there
was
error
in
this
instruction
that
allowed
the
jury
to
consider
the
dea
objective,
at
least
what
this
court
ought
to
do
is
use
the
harmless
error
analysis
that
was
used
in
yates
v.
eva.
i
think
in
yates
v.
eva,
we
had
a
situation
where
the
court
observed
that
there
was
error
in
yates.
the
error
reflected
or
revolved
around
the
way
in
which
the
defendant
was
found
guilty
of
murder.
the
presumption...
the
one
way
that
it
was
done
was
through
the
presumption,
and
since
that
was
a
unconstitutional
burden-shifting
presumption,
the
court
then
had
to
look
and
see
whether
or
not
it
was
harmless
error
since
it
was
possible
that
the
jury
found
guilt
by
review
of
the
evidence
as
a
whole,
and
therefore,
found
malice.
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
it's
not
sufficient
that
the
jury
could
have
found
guilt
by
reason
of
review
of
the
entire
record.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that's
what
the
jury
did.
did
the
jury
decide
guilt
on
the
evidence
as
a
whole
and
not
use
that
burden-shifting
presumption.
the
state
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
said
all
we
have
to
do
is
determine
that
the
jury
could
have
found
guilt
on
the
evidence
as
a
whole.
and
this
court
has
said,
no,
that
is
not
the
chapman
test.
what
you
do
then
in
your
analysis
is
look
at
the
jury
instructions.
i
ask
the
court
here
today
to
look
at
the
jury
instructions
in
griffin.
those
jury
instructions
were
in
error.
those
jury
instructions
said
yes,
you
may
use
this
disjunctive
object,
this
dea
object,
to
find
guilt.
then
what
you
do
is
you
keep
in
mind
at
all
times
that
jurors
are
presumed
to
follow
their
instructions,
richardson
v.
marsh.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
20,
it
was
government's
instruction
20,
your
honor.
it's
on
page
31
of
the--
mr.
michael
g.
logan
--and
i
think
that
instruction
is
not
unlike
the
yates...
the
instruction
in
yates
v.
the
united
states
where
the
government
there
formed
the
instruction
from
the
statute
itself.
and
what
the
court
said
in
yates
v.
united
states
is
that
the
evidence
lent
itself
as
much
to
the
insufficient
object
at
it
lent
itself
to
the
sufficient
object.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
well,
i
think
it's
a
rule
that
we
have
to
employ
if
we're
going
to
make
any
kind
of
solid
determination
of
what
the
jury
actually
did
in
the
case.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
no.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
well,
if
laymen
on
the
street
understood
that,
your
honor,
then
why
do
you
have
judgments
of
acquittal?
why
do
we
have
judgments
not
withstanding
the
verdict?
we
have
those
remedies
at
law
because
juries
do
not
recognize
the
legal
sufficiency
about--
mr.
michael
g.
logan
--i
think
we
would
be
asking
the
lay
people
the
wrong
premise,
because
that
does
not
reflect
the
case
that
i
have
taken
to
this
court.
the
case
in
my...
the
case
that
i
have
taken
to
this
court
is
that
there
were
volumes
of
evidence
concerning
griffin's
association
with
major
drug
dealers
in
chicago.
the
problem
was
that
it
was
hollow
and
jurors
cannot
be
expected
to
differentiate
between
that.
and
griffin
sought
the
protection
of
the
law.
she
said
to
the
court--
mr.
michael
g.
logan
--well,
i'm...
first
of
all
i'm
asking
for
a
ruling
in
my
case
that
i
think
is
a
very
common
situation.
and
i
point
again
to
cramer.
and
there
are
many
other
cases
where
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
case
concerning
violation
of
an
object,
but
it's
not
legally
sufficient.
and
i
pointed
out
in
my
briefs
there
are
four
conspiracy...
drug
conspiracy
cases
last
year
in
the
seventh
circuit.
four
of
them
were
reversed
for
insufficient
evidence.
here
is
a
case
where
jurors
received
evidence
concerning
participation
in
a
drug
conspiracy
and
convicted
people,
but
the
court
said
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
i
submit
to
this
court
it's
very
likely
that
diane
griffin
was
convicted
on
the
drug
arm
of
this
conspiracy
because
what
you
had
was
no
differentiation.
what
you
had
was
3
or
4
weeks
of
the
government
attempting
to
convict
this
woman
with
drug
dealers
of
a
drug
offense.
and
it
was
beyond
the
expectation,
reasonable
expectation
for
a
court
to
say,
now
jurors,
ignore
all
that
volume
of
hollow
evidence.
and
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
anything
else,
but
here's
the
case.
now
you
decide
the
case.
and
we
have
two
other
individuals
who
are
admittedly
sufficiently
convicted
on
the
evidence.
and
there's
no
distinction
between
diane
griffin?
why
wasn't
she
given
the
protection
of
the
law?
and
that's
the
question
i
think
your
honor
has
asked
me.
i
don't
know.
but
she
was
entitled
to
it.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
i
don't
believe...
i
believe...
i
think
i
may
be
here,
but
i
think
that
this
court
may
devise
a
rule,
from
what
i've
been
seeing
from
this
court's
decisions,
that
the
court
would
say
that
we
don't
have
any
question
because
there
wasn't
any
evidence
on
that.
we
can
say
the
jury
decided
on
the
sufficient
one.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
i
disagree
with
that
statement.
i
did
not
take
that
position.
i
think
i
may
have
argued
that
to
the
jury
in
my
advocacy
on
behalf
of
my
client,
but
when
i
spoke
to
the
court,
i
was
speaking
as
lawyer
to
judge
and
as
lawyer
to
lawyer
with
the
government,
that
it
was
not
there.
mr.
michael
g.
logan
when
it
made
that
statement,
yes,
i
do.
