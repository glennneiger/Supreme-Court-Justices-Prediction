justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
one
possible
reason
that
there
were
other
defendants
as
to
whom
the
evidence
was
sufficient?
the
judge
didn't
instruct,
did
he,
that
they
could
find
griffin
guilty
of
either
conspiracy?
and
i
don't
think
the
united
states
argued
that
in
its
closing
argument,
although
you
might
correct
me
on
that
point
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
he
didn't
say
specific...
the
trial
judge
didn't
say
specifically
as
to
griffin.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
government
argue
in
its
closing
argument
specifically
that
griffin
could
be
guilty
of
the
dea
or
the
irs
conspiracy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
he
argue
that
they
could
be
convicted
on...
that
griffin
could
be
convicted
on
either?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
specifically
as
to
griffin?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
should
the
judge
have
given
a
clarifying
instruction
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
have
been
the
better
practice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that
if
we
rule
for
the
petitioner,
it
would
necessitate
increased
use
of
special
verdicts,
special
interrogatories.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
what
are
the
reasons...
i've
noticed
that
in
some
of
our
cases
we
comment
somewhat
negatively
against
the
use
of
special
interrogatories
and
special
verdicts
in
criminal
cases.
is
the
reason
for
that
that
it
unduly
constricts
the
jury's
deliberations?
is
that
the
proffered
rationale?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
if
the
defense
asks
for
it,
that
argument's
out
of
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and,
i
take
it,
it
could
also
make
it
harder
on
the
government
in
some
cases
to
prove
its
case?
