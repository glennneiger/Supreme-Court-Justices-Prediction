justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
in
argument
there
was
some
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
insufficient.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
the
government
actually
opposed
giving
the
instruction,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
wanted
the
jury
to
be
told
that
they
could
convict
on
either
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
if
there
was
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
think
that
if
the
government
opposed
the
instruction,
but
nevertheless
conceded
that
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
to
convict,
it
may
be
that
both
you
and
the
government
were
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
was
evidence
and
your
problem
is
the
jury...
you're
suggesting
that
the
jury
found
your
client
guilty
on
a
basis
on
which
just
the
government
thought
there
was
insufficient
evidence.
the
jury
may
have
thought
there
was
sufficient
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
that
isn't
the
court's
job
to
do
that.
it's
the
jury's
job
to
say
whether
there
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
never
granted
your
motion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
did
the...
apparently,
so
did
the
judge
think
it
ought
to
be
submitted
because
he
refused
your...
the
judge
may
have
thought,
well,
if
i
were
a
juror,
i
wouldn't
think
this
was
enough
evidence.
but
he
nevertheless
sent
it
to
the
jury.
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
just
said
that
it's
my
opinion
there's
not
enough
evidence.
but
he
must
have
thought
there
was
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
what
he
thought.
then
why
did
he
let
it
go
to
the
jury
on
that
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
for
the
drug
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
got
you.
so
they
judged
it
on
the
basis
that
there
was...
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
if
there
was
insufficient
evidence
on
this
one
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
the
way
the
case
comes
to
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
your
job
is
to
convince
us
that
that's
then
a
case
where
you
can't
tell
what
the
jury
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
jury
understood
here
that
either
one
would
suffice?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if...
suppose
the
instruction
said
that
the
charge
is
a
and
b,
and
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
a
and
b,
why
return
the
verdict
of
guilty.
do
you
think
the
jury
then
understands
that
either
one
would
be
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know.
if
you
said,
well,
the
jury
had
to
find
a
and
b,
but
it
couldn't
have
found
a
because
as
a
matter
of
law
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
to
support
that
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
if
the
jury
was
instructed
that
in
order
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty,
you
have
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
both
a
and
b.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
instruction
that
was
actually
given
on
this
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
if
there
had
been
absolutely
no
evidence
about
her
connection
with
the
drug
conspiracy
to
impede
the
efforts
of
the
drug
administration,
then
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i'm
looking
at
the
district
court's
opinion.
it
says
both
parties
concede
that
there
is
no
evidence
showing
that
griffin
had
knowledge
of
this
object
of
the
conspiracy.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
the
district
court
was
just
wrong
in
its
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it...
i
see
the
district
court
also
said
that
the
only
evidence
implicating
griffin
related
to
this...
to
the
irs
object.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
did
not
even
ague
that
griffin
had
knowledge
of
the
efforts
to
impair
the
dea.
