john
paul
stevens
mr.
logan,
may
i
interrupt?
does
that
mean
that
in
this
case
there
had
been
absolutely
no
evidence
tying
your
client
to
the
drug
enforcement
aspect
of
the
case,
and
only
evidence
tied
her
to
the
tax
aspect
of
it,
that
then
the
verdict
would
stand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
have
to
differentiate
between
cases
where
there's
no
evidence
on
the
one
hand,
and
cases
where
there's
some
evidence
but
it's
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law,
on
the
other
hand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
have
to
either
do
that
or
overrule
turner,
i
guess
is
what
you're
saying.
well,
you
still
have
to
ask
whether
there's
a
difference
in
a
case
where
the
indictment
charges
the
two
acts
conjunctively
and
a
case
where
it's
in
the
alternative.
as
this
case
went
to
the
jury,
or
as
the
government
argued,
that
it's...
the
jury
could
find
the
fellow
guilty
if
they
found
either
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
that
your
rule
would
apply
equally
to
charges
in
the
conjunctive
and
an
either/or
charge.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
there
an
exception
for
cases
in
which
the
second
ground
was
one
to
be
constitutionally
impermissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
if
in
such
a
case,
where
you
have
a
plain...
you
know,
stromberg
type...
a
plainly
insufficient
count
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
another
one
sufficient.
could
the
government
defend
the
jury
verdict
on
the
ground
that
well,
there
really
wasn't
any
evidence
at
all
to
support
the
defective
count?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
that
wasn't
a
conspiracy
case,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
a
sense
that's
dicta,
just
like
the
haupt
case
got
square
dicta
on
the
other
side,
saying
the
other
way.
that
footnote
in
haupt,
you
know,
clearly
reads
like
a
blanket
on
this
case,
but
the
answer
is
it's
dicta,
and
i
agree
with
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
have
got
one
dicta
against
another.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure
it
can.
in
this
case
it
can
be
distinguished
because
it's
not
a
conspiracy
case.
