mr.
logan,
in
a
conspiracy
case,
typically
it's
also
alleged
by
the
prosecutor
that
there
have
been
overt
acts
committed
in
support
of
the
conspiracy...
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
would
your
rule
apply
there,
too?
suppose
that
the
government
charges
several
overt
acts
and
there
is
insufficient
evidence
as
to
one
of
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
normally
a
statute
requires
that
there
be
proof
of
some
overt
act
and
furtherance.
and
i
just
wondered
whether
your
theory
wouldn't
lead
to
the
same
approach
in
the
case
of
a
deficiency
of
proof
on
one
of
the
alleged
acts
and
furtherance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
one
say
that
there's
a
legal
flaw
where
evidence
is
so
insufficient
that
as
a
matter
of
law
it
shouldn't
go
to
the
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
isn't
the
jury's
task
normally.
if
evidence
is
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law,
then
it's
up
to
the
judge
to
say
so
and
not
give
it
to
the
jury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
distinguish
cramer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
a
piece
of
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
asked
mr.
logan
earlier
whether
he
would
extend
his
rule
to
overt
acts,
and
he
said
oh,
no.
and
yet
listening
to
you
makes
it
sound
as
though
you
would
concede
that
certainly
as
to
overt
acts,
if
one
was
insufficient--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
anything
to
prevent
the
government,
the
prosecution
from
just
loading
up
an
indictment
with
all
kinds
of
alleged
objects
of
a
conspiracy
and
overt
acts,
and
just
tossing
everything
in
but
the
kitchen
sink?
