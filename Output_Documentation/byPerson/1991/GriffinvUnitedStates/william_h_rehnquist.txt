we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-6352,
diane
griffin
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
logan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
asked
someone
on
the
street
whether
it
was
more
likely
that
a
jury
would
convict
on
a
count
where
there
was
sufficient
evidence
or
on
a
count
where
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence,
i
suppose
the
person's
answer
would
be
on
the
count
where
there
was
sufficient
evidence,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
logan,
the
question
on
which
we
granted
certiorari
is
whether
a
conviction
for
a
multiple
object
conspiracy
must
be
set
aside
when
the
jury
returns
a
general
verdict
of
guilty
and
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
support
one
of
the
objects
of
the
conspiracy.
i
think
we're
less
interested
in
the
intricacies
of
what
happened
in
trial
than
in
arguments
on
that
legal
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you'd
really
get
into
the
question
that
justice
stevens
posed
to
you
earlier.
the
closer
the
evidence
was
be...
was
on
the
count
that
it
was
insufficient
and
the
closer
it
was
to
being
sufficient,
the
more
likely
the
evidence
was...
would
be
not
to
be
harmless,
whereas
if
there
were
virtually
no
evidence
on
that
count,
then
it
would
be
much
more
likely
to
be
harmless
error.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
somehow
doesn't
seem
like
a
very
workable
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
it...
isn't
it
a
very
logical
presumption
to
say
that
if
the
two
counts
go
to
the
jury,
one
on
which
the
evidence
is
insufficient
and
the
other
on
which
it's
sufficient,
and
the
jury
convicts,
you
don't
know
on
which
count
that
they
convicted
on
the
one
where
the
evidence
was
sufficient?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
any
layman
on
the
street
would
surely
disagree
with
your
answer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
jury
understanding,
i'm
just
talking
about
common
sense.
you
ask
someone
who,
say,
just
walked
into
the
spectator
section
of
a
courtroom,
here's
the
situation.
two
counts
are
submitted
to
the
jury,
on
one
there
was
insufficient
evidence
and
on
the
other
there
was
sufficient
evidence.
the
jury
convicted,
we
don't
know
on
which
count.
what
can
we
do?
i
think
most
of
us
would
say
what's
the
problem?
we'll
assume
the
jury
convicted
on
the
count
where
there
was
sufficient
evidence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you're
asking
for
a
rule
for
your
particular
case,
not
for
the
generality
of
circumstances?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
logan.
mr.
bryson,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
a
matter
of
tactics,
though,
don't
the
party...
don't
parties
with
the
burden
of
proof
generally
not
want
special
interrogatories
because
they're
easier
to...
it
makes
it
easier
to
upset
a
case
on
appeal?
and
it
also
makes
it
easier
to
find
some
flaw
in
the
jury's
reasoning
process.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
party
with
the
burden
of
proof
wants
the
jury
to
come
back
with
one
word,
really.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
want
two
words
in
a
criminal
case.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr
bryson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-6352,
griffin
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
