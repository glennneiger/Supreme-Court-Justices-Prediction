well,
you
know
if
you
accept
the
presumption
that
the
jury
follows
its
instructions,
don't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
the
issue
get
settled
by
the
instruction
on
burden
of
proof
and
the
quantum
of
proof
necessary?
and
everyone
agrees
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence,
and
if
the
jury
followed
that
instruction,
it
could
not
have
convicted
on
that
particular
possibility.

mr.
bryson,
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
not
a
concession
as
there
was
here...
i
think
it's
set
out
on
page
19
of
the
brief,
but
you
read
it
a
moment
ago,
the
government's
concession
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
on
the
dea
issue.
absent
that
kind
of
concession,
isn't
the
jury's
most
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
judge's
act
in
sending
an
issue
to
it
that
there
is
at
least
evidence
upon
which
it
could
find
for
the
government?
justice
david
h.
souter
they...
they're
not
given
as
a
matter
of
course,
are
they?
and
in
any
case,
there
was
no
such
instruction
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
any
other
assumption
would
run
afoul
of
the
presumption
of
regularity,
wouldn't
it?
