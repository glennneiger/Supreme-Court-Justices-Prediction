mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
first
address
the
factual
setting
in
which
this
case
arises
and
then
move
on
to
the
broader
legal
questions
that
the
case
raises.
but
i
do
want
to
address
very
briefly
the
facts
in
the
case
because
mr.
logan
has
suggested
that
the
government
had
pressed
the
dea
object
upon
the
jury
and
the
court
as
a
viable
basis
for
conviction
when,
in
fact,
that's
just
not
the
case
at
all.
and
very
briefly
what
happened
in
this
case
in
closing
argument
was
that
after
the
government's
proof
had
essentially
failed
on
the
piece
of
evidence
that
we
hoped
would
show
diane
griffin's
knowledge...
excuse
me...
of
the
drug
dealing
that
beverly
was
involved
in
was
that
the
government
argued
entirely
the
tax
basis
for
conviction.
the
government
started
out
its
closing
argument
by
saying
beverly,
mcnulty,
and
griffin
are
charged
in
count
20
with
defrauding
the
united
states
by
impeding
the
activities
of
the
irs
and
the
dea,
which,
of
course,
was
true.
that
was
the
charge.
and,
in
fact,
the
evidence
was
sufficient
with
respect
to
both
beverly
and
mcnulty.
but
the
government
then
went
to
discuss
griffin
entirely
in
terms
of
the
tax
purpose.
defense
counsel
came
back
and
argued...
it
specifically
said,
you
will
not
hear
the
government
speaking
about
the
dea
object
in
this
case
because
there
isn't
any
evidence
of
diane
griffin's
involvement
in
the
dea
object.
and
indeed,
in
the
rebuttal
summation,
that
is
exactly
what
happened.
now
it
is
true
that
the
government
at
one
point,
the
prosecutor
slipped
and
said
something
about
diane
griffin's
seeing
cocaine.
this
was
because
that
was
the
evidence
that
we
expected
to
see,
but
in
fact,
that
was
where
the
proof
had
failed
and
the
witness
didn't
give
us
that
evidence.
but
upon
objection,
the
prosecutor
then
got
up
and
said,
i
am
sorry,
i
misspoke.
i
misspoke
earlier.
and
i'd
like
to
read
this
because
it
makes
the
point,
i
think,
very
graphically,
that
this
issue
was
not
argued
to
the
jury.
"i
misspoke
with
respect
to
diane
griffin,
and
that
is
that
i
said
there
is
evidence
that
she
saw
cocaine
and
there's
none.
"
"and
we're
not
arguing
that.
"
"diane
griffin
is
charged
in
this
case
with
assisting,
knowingly
assisting
alex
beverly
in
hiding
his
assets
from
the
irs.
"
"it's
that
simple.
"
"and
we
believe
that
the
evidence
has
shown
that
that's
what
she
did.
"
so
there's
not
an
effort
here,
as
i
think
counsel
suggests,
to
try
to
get
the
best
of
both
sides
and
somehow
hope
that
the
jury
would
find
a
dea
purpose.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
relying
on
this
passage,
among
others,
in
which
we
specifically
and
explicitly
conceded
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
anything
other
than
the
irs
purpose.
so
the
way
the
case
went
to
the
jury,
it
is,
i
submit,
virtually
inconceivable
that
the
jury
could
have
convicted
on
the
dea
object.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
your
honor,
we
would.
and
then
let
me
move
with
that
question
to
the
broader
question
of
whether...
setting
aside
the
facts
of
this
case,
even
if
there
had
been
some
evidence--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
absolutely.
and
the
only
reason
i
start
with
that
is
because
i
want
to
make
sure
that
the
factual
basis
on
which
we're
proceeding
is
clear.
and
that
is
that
whatever
you
may
think
as
to
the
broader
question,
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
risks
of
an
improper
conviction
were
minimal.
but
in
any
event,
let
me
move
to
the
broader
question--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
would
not
for
the
following
reason.
that
typically
when
you
have
a
conspiracy
that
may
involve
two
closely
related
objects,
typically
that
is
regarded
as
a
single
agreement
in
which
there
is
only
one
agreement,
even
though
it
may
have
two
objects,
and
which
can't
support...
indeed,
it
would
be
a
multiplicitous
charge
if
we
tried
to
charge
it
as
supporting
separate
judgments.
if
you
have
two
different
agreements,
in
other
words,
if
i
conspire
with
someone
to,
let's
say
manufacture
narcotics,
and
i
later
conspire
with
someone
else
to
distribute
narcotics,
i
may
well
have
engaged
in
two
separate
conspiracies
that
can
be
charged
in
separate
counts.
but
if
i
conspire
with
a
group
of
people
to
both
manufacture
and
then
distribute
the
same
narcotics,
even
though
there
are
technically
two
different
objects
to
the
conspiracy,
it's
just
one
conspiracy.
and
the
government
can't
separately
obtain
judgments
on
both
parts
of
that
conspiracy
and
obtain,
among
other
things,
cumulative
punishment.
so
there
are
limits
on
what
we
can
do.
and
we
have
in
good
faith,
only
one
agreement.
and
that's
what
we
had
here.
even
though
it
may
have
multiple
objects,
we
can
only
charge
it
in
the
single
count.
our
options
were
just
limited
in
that
respect.
now,
the
basic
principle,
i
think,
that's
involved
here
is
a
principle
that
is
at
the
heart
of
appellate
review
of
jury
verdicts.
and
that
is
we
ask
whether
a
hypothetical,
rational
jury
could
convict
on
the
evidence
in
the
record,
could
find
the
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
don't
ask
what
route
this
jury
may
have
taken
to
conclude
that
the
evidence
was
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now
the
defendant
in
this
case
says
that
we
don't
know
what
route
this
jury
took.
it
may
have
gone
irs,
it
may
have
gone
dea.
we
just
don't
know.
but
that's
true
in
every
single
sufficiency
case.
you
invariably
have
the
situation
in
which
we
don't
know,
and
indeed,
we
don't
even
ask,
what
route
a
jury
took.
we
ask,
did
that
hypothetical,
rational
jury
have
enough
evidence
that
looking
at
the
whole
record,
they
could
have
found
a
way
toward
conviction.
and
to
underscore
the
point,
suppose
you
have
a
case
in
which
the
indications
from
the
way
the
evidence
comes
in
and
the
way
the
case
is
argued,
the
indications
are
that
the
jury
may
well
have
been
particularly
interested
in
a
particular
theory
of
liability
and
that
you
might
well
guess
that
that's
what
the
jury
may
have
been
induced
to
convict
on.
but
in
fact,
the
reviewing
court
says
that
theory
of
liability
is
insufficient.
it
just...
there
isn't
enough
evidence
to
support
a
conviction
on
that
theory.
but
there
is
other
evidence
in
the
record
which
could
have
supported
the
jury
verdict.
then
that's
enough
to
uphold
the
verdict
as
sufficient,
legally
sufficient.
you
don't
ask
how
did
this
jury
get
to
this
result.
and
if
you
conclude
that
this
jury
followed
an
improper
path,
you
reverse.
now--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
the
distinction
between--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
you
would
have
a
question
of
harmless
error
in
that
setting.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example
taken
from
stromberg,
perhaps,
if
i
understand
your
question.
suppose
in
the
stromberg
case,
you
had
multiple
bases
for
the
charge.
one
of
which
was
using
a
red
flag
to
organize
opposition
to
government,
which
was
essentially
the
ground
that
was
struck
down
in
stromberg.
suppose
further
that
in
that
particular
case,
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
red
flag
at
all.
there
was
the...
the
evidence
was
that
there
was
whatever,
violence,
anarchism,
or
whatever,
but
no
red
flag.
now
even
if
the
judge
charged
the
jury
that
you
could
convict
on
the
basis
of
finding
a
red
flag
that
was
used
to
organize
opposition
against
the
government.
we
submit
that
would
be
error
because
that
would
be
impermissible
ground
for
conviction
as
a
legal
matter,
but
it
would
be
harmless
because
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
case
of
any
red
flag.
that
would
be
the
situation
if
you
both
had
essentially
factual
sufficiency
and
legal
error
with
respect
to
the
same
evidence.
but
that's
a
harmless
error
question.
this
is
not,
we
submit,
a
harmless
error
question
at
all.
this
is
simply
a
matter
of
how
you
look
at
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
now,
turner,
it
seems
to
us,
answers
this
question
quite
clearly.
what
turner
says,
and
i'd
like
to
read,
if
i
could,
the
specific
quote
from
turner
because
i
think
it
puts
the
point
better
than
i
could
put
it
by
arguing
from
the
case.
it
says,
"when
a
jury
returns
a
guilty
verdict
on
an
indictment
charging
several
acts
in
the
conjunctive,
the
verdict
stands
if
the
evidence
is
sufficient
with
respect
to
any
one
of
the
acts
charged.
"
if
the
evidence
is
sufficient,
that
is
to
say
it's
sufficient
to
get
to
the
jury,
with
respect
to
any
of
the
acts
charged,
that's
enough.
you
don't
have
to...
and
this
is
the
following
sentence.
here
the
evidence
proved
that
turner
was
distributing
heroin.
the
status
of
the
case
with
respect
to
the
other
allegations
is
irrelevant
to
the
validity
of
turner's
convictions.
in
other
words,
once
you
satisfy
yourself
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient
on
one
of
the
grounds
for
conviction,
then
you
need
look
no
farther.
and
even
if
the
evidence
is
insufficient
with
respect
to
others,
that
the
conviction
must
me
affirmed.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
was
not
a
conspiracy
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
of
course.
it
does.
well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--except
that
i
think
haupt
can
be
distinguished...
first
of
all
we
think
that
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
is
not
a
conspiracy
case.
however,
haupt,
you
can
say,
is
a
case
in
which
there
were
multiple
specifications
within
the
same
count
which
is,
in
a
sense,
like
a
duplicitous
count.
and
this
comes
up
sometimes
in
perjury
cases
and
obstruction
of
justice
cases
where
we
say
there
are
five
specifications
of
falsehood.
you
could
charge
those,
as
in
justice
blackmun,
in
response
to
justice
blackmun's
questions.
you
could
charge
those
as
separate
counts.
so
we're
not
locked
into
a
single
count.
and
in
fact,
you
could
argue
that
such
a
count
that
charges
five
different
specifications
of
perjury
is,
in
fact,
duplicitous.
so
you
could
say,
all
right,
in
that
setting,
you're
going
to
have
to
establish
that
each
one
of
them
is
proved.
we
don't
agree
with
that
rule,
but
you
could
certainly
characterize
haupt
as
standing
for...
excuse
me...
no
more
than
that.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is
because
yates
was
a
case
that
held
that
where
there
is
legal
error,
where
the
jury
in
effect
is
told
that
something
is
a
crime
which
isn't
a
crime,
and
the
jury
may
have
based
its
conviction
on
that
theory,
then
you
have
to
reverse.
in
yates
there
was
no
reason
to
assume,
as
there
is
here,
that
the
jury
based
its
conviction
on
some
other
ground
because
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
to
support
the
conviction
if
the
legal
ground
that
was
given
to
the
jury
on
which
to
convict
was
correct.
but
it
wasn't.
this
court
said
no,
that
was
an
improper
legal
ground
for
conviction.
therefore,
we
can
simply
not
assume
that
the
jury
didn't
convict
on
that
theory.
here
we
can
assume
that
the
jury
didn't
convict
on
the
theory
that
was
insufficiently
proved.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
not
at
all.
and
i
think
they
stand
together.
and
in
fact,
i
think
yates
continues
to
be
applied,
and
properly
so,
in
cases
in
which
there
is
a
legal
flaw,
in
which...
in
the
theories...
one
of
the
theories
that
was
presented
to
the
jury
in
which
there
is
some
basis
on
which
the
jury's
instructed,
for
example,
that
conduct
that
is
not
a
crime
is,
in
fact,
a
basis
for
criminal
liability.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that...
you
can
say,
of
course,
that
that
is...
it
is
a
legal
error
to
submit
a
count
on
which
there
is
insufficient
evidence.
i
would
have
two
answers
to
the
question,
though,
your
honor.
first,
we
think
that
is
a
legal
error
of
an
entirely
different
sort
from
a
legal
error
of
the
yates
sort,
where
what
you're
talking
about
is
telling
a
jury
this
is
a
crime,
and
in
fact,
it
isn't
a
crime.
here
what
you
are
saying
by
submitting
the
case
is
there...
the
jury
may
consider
this
evidence,
and
as
we
say,
the...
where
the
evidence
is
insufficient,
that
is
the
jury's...
it
is
the
jury's
task
to
determine
on
which
basis
it
wants
to
convict.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
that's
correct
with
respect
at
least
to
cases
in
which
the
judge
is
striking
a
whole
count
or
a
whole
charge.
this
isn't
that
kind
of
case.
and
we
submit...
and
this
is
the
second
half
of
my
answer
to
you...
is
that
this
is
not
a
case
that
comes
within
rule
29,
which
refers
to
granting
motions
of
acquittal...
judgments
for
motions...
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
with
respect
to
any
offense
or
offenses.
this
is
a
case
in
which
some
piece
of
the
case,
some
piece
of
the
offense
is
deemed
insufficient.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
cramer
is
a
case
in
which
what
the
court
is
saying
is
there
is,
with
respect
to
these
alleged
overt
acts--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it
was,
your
honor.
but
what
the
court
was
saying
was
the
case
as
it
went
to
the
jury,
and
as
it
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
was
decided
on
a
legally
erroneous
ground.
and
that
is,
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
an
overt
act
was
legally
sufficient
if
it
merely
did
something,
as
in
a
conspiracy
context,
to
promote
the
treason.
what
this
court
held
was
no.
overt
acts
require
much
more
by
way
of
proof.
that
was
a
legal
ground.
the
court
was
saying
as
a
matter
of
law,
constitutional
law,
overt
acts
must
actually
show
that
aiding
and
comforting
the
enemy
is
going
on.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
oh,
no,
your
honor,
no,
in
fact--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--not
at
all.
i
think
the...
it's
quite
clear
that
in
fact
the
mischief
of
the
rule
for
which
petitioner
is
requesting
here
is
precisely
that,
that
you
would
have
to
take
every
conspiracy
charge
and
say
was
there
any
overt
act
that
was
not
sufficiently
proved.
and
then
the
logic
of
this
position
would
be
to
say,
all
right,
if
there
was
one
overt
act
that
was
not
sufficiently
proved,
the
jury
may
have
rested
its
verdict
on
that
overt
act.
therefore,
we
have
to
reverse.
in
this
case,
for
example,
there
were
10
overt
acts.
what
if
the
evidence
failed
with
respect
to
one
of
them?
wouldn't
his
argument
compel
reversal
if
you
accept
it.
he
says
no,
i
didn't
understand
what
the
rationale
of
the
distinction
was,
but
i
think
when
you
get
down
to
it,
there
is
really
no
reason
not
to
extend
that
rationale
to
the
overt
act
setting.
that's
one
of
the
principal
reasons
that
we
think
would
be
extremely
mischievous
to
adopt
the
position
that
petitioner
is
arguing
for.
the
same
thing
could
be
said,
for
example,
the
identity
of
co-conspirators.
you
could
say,
all
right,
there
were
10
co-conspirators
named
in
the
indictment.
the
proof
was
sufficient
as
to
nine,
but
insufficient
as
to
one,
but
that
one
co-conspirator
may
have
been
the
co-conspirator
that
the
jury
found
the
defendant
to
have
conspired
with.
the
jury
may
further
have
found
that
the
defendant
did
not
conspire
with
any
of
the
others.
therefore,
the
verdict
may
have
been
premised
on
an
insufficiently
proved
basis
and
we,
therefore,
have
to
reverse.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
yes,
your
honor.
we...
there
are
two
things,
i
think.
first
of
all,
we
do
have
an
obligation,
i
think
both
an
ethical
obligation
and
a
legal
obligation
to
ensure
that
everything
that
goes
into
an
indictment
is
established
to
probable
cause...
at
least
to
the
degree
of
confidence
of
probable
cause,
which
is
the
degree
that
the
grand
jury
has
to
find.
the
second
ground
is
a
practical
matter.
if
you
have
a
lot
in
the
indictment
that
your
proof
is
not
going
to
establish,
you
give
defense
counsel
a
lot
to
shoot
at.
and
in
fact,
to
some
extent,
that's
what
happened
here
because
defense
counsel
made
pretty
good
use
of
the
fact
that
our
proof
had
failed
on
the
dea
object
in
order
to
say
that
well,
all
right,
diane
griffin
is
already
half
way
out
of
the
soup.
it
looks
like
the
government's
case
is
already
in
trouble,
why
not
go
the
other
half.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
i
think
in
this
case
it
would
not
have
been
an
error
had
she
done
so,
but
it
was
not
error
for
her
not
to
do
so.
there's
no...
i
think
there's
no
obligation--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--in
this
case,
i
can't
quarrel
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
would
have
made
things
easier
to
do
it,
except,
and
this
is
a
big
except,
the
problem
is
that
if
you
instruct
with
respect
to
somebody
who
is
one
of
three
defendants
in
a
count,
as
was
the
case
here,
then
the
suggestion
is...
and
if
you
say,
well,
with
respect
to
this
defendant,
you
can
only
find
her
guilty
if
you
find
the
irs
object,
the
suggestion
is
you're
making
some
kind
of
suggestion
that
the
evidence
insufficient
with
respect
to
the
others
with
respect
to
both
dea
and
irs.
it
is
something
which,
if
i
were
representing
mcnulty,
for
example,
i
would
not
want
to
hear
the
judge
saying...
specifically
picking
out
griffin
and
saying
the
evidence
on
griffin
will
only
support
a
conviction
on
one
theory.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
would
certainly
requires
some
dramatic
changes
in
the
way
cases
are
tried.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
because
of
what
i
have
just
said,
in
this
case,
if
we
simply
went
to
the
jury
in
a
case
in
which
there
were
11
overt
acts,
in
which
there
were
10
different
paragraphs
listing
the
manner
and
means
by
which
this
conspiracy
was
carried
forward,
in
which
there
were
two
co-conspirators,
and
in
which
there
were
two
purposes,
we
would
have
potentially
25
different
sufficiency
questions,
not
1,
with
respect
to
that
one
count.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
think
there
are
a
variety
of
concerns.
the
spock
case,
which
is
one
of
the
leading
cases
on
this,
said
that
the
problem
is
that
it
can
be
prejudicial
to
the
defense
because
it
leads
the
jury
down
the
road
to
conviction.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
may
be.
the
other
concerns,
i
think,
that
have
been
raised
are
that
you
ask
the
jury
to
parse
the
case
in
ways
that
may
be
confusing,
that
may
ask
the
jury
a
series
of
questions
that
can
mislead
the
jury,
rather
than
being
helpful.
it
can
be
useful,
and
i'm
reluctant
to
say
there
should
be
any
across-the-board
prohibition
because
there
are
instances
in
which
it
could
be
useful.
but
there
are
also
instances
in
which
it
can
just
confuse.
and
i
think
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
when
you
are
having
special
verdicts
with
respect
to
one
defendant
on
one
purpose,
it
can
give
the
jury
a
misleading
impression
as
to
a
particular
facet
of
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
can...
in
some
cases
i
think
it
can
actually
make
it
easier.
and
sometimes
we
ask
for
special
verdicts
when,
for
example,
we
want
to
insure
that
if
we
think
there
may
be
a
legal
flaw
in
one
of,
let's
say,
the
predicate
acts
in
the
rico
case.
we
want
to
insure
that
the
jury
marks
off
each
of
the
predicate
acts
so
that
we
still
have
plenty
of
predicate
acts
left.
so
it
can
be
easier...
it
can
actually
be
something
that's
easier
for
the
government
rather
than--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
right.
the
jury
may
make
a
strange
mark
on
a
special
verdict
form
because
they
didn't
understand
how
the
form
was
to
be
filled
out.
there...
any
number
of
things
can
happen
in
the
context
of
a
special
verdict,
and
only
one
of
them
is
good.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
i
think
generally
so.
i
think
i
would
put
as
a
footnote,
i
would
say
there
are
instances
in
which
we
do
want
a
little
more
than
just
one
word,
but
it's
not
typically
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
juries
are
so
sophisticated
typically
that
they
understand
that
when
they
get
an
issue
for
their
resolution,
that
it
is
somehow
past
a
judge's
rule
29
scrutiny.
in
fact,
there
are
instructions
which
are
designed
specifically
to
rebut
that
suggestion.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
there
wasn't.
typically
what
they're
given...
where
some
defendants
have
been
given
a
judgment
of
acquittal
at
xx
close
of
the
evidence
and
are
missing,
where
the
judge
will
say
something
to
the
effect
that
it
is
none
of
your
business
to
inquire
why
x,
y,
and
x
are
not
here,
because
the
judge
does
not
want
to
let
the
jury
thing
that
x,
y,
and
z
are
not
here
because
the
judge
has
decided
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
them,
but
aha,
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient
as
to
all
the
rest.
so
the
assumption,
i
think,
of
our
system,
is
that
the
jury
does
not
take
the
fact
that
they
get
a
case
as
an
indication
from
the
court
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
take
the
case
to
the
jury.
and
there
certainly
was
no
suggestion
to
that
effect
here.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
so,
yes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
