justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
logan,
what
do
you
do
about
turner
v.
united
states?
do
you
ask
us
to
overrule
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
read
it
that
way.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
says
in
turner
is
that
the
general
rule
is
that
when
a
jury
returns
a
guilty
verdict
on
an
indictment
charging
several
acts
in
the
conjunctive,
as
turner's
indictment
did,
the
verdict
stands
if
the
evidence
is
sufficient
with
respect
to
any
one
of
the
acts
charged.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
at
least
asking
us
to
go
back
on
that...
on
that
statement,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
had
be
otherwise?
would
you
be
arguing
differently?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
didn't
really
think
we
took
this
to
sort
of
review
the
instructions.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
diane
griffin
and
two
others
were
charged
with
conspiring
to
defraud
an
agency
of
the
federal
government.
the
conspiracy
allegedly
had
two
objects:
one,
to
prevent
the
internal
revenue
service
from
ascertaining
income
taxes;
and
two,
to
prevent
the
dea,
the
drug
enforcement
administration,
from
ascertaining
forfeitable
assets.
at
trial,
the
government
introduced
evidence
implicating
griffin
in
the
first
object
of
the
conspiracy
but
no
evidence
implicating
her
in
the
second.
in
spite
of
this,
the
district
court
instructed
the
jury
in
a
manner
that
would
permit
it
to
return
a
verdict
against
griffin
if
it
found
her
to
have
participated
in
either
one
of
the
two
objects.
the
jury
returned
a
general
verdict
of
guilty.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
griffins'
conviction
rejecting
the
argument
that
the
general
verdict
could
not
stand
because
it
left
in
doubt
whether
the
jury
had
convicted
her
as
to
the
first
object
of
the
conspiracy
for
which
there
was
adequate
evidence
or
as
to
the
second
for
which
there
was
not.
we
granted
certiorari
and
today,
we
affirm.
neither
the
due
pprocess
clause
of
the
constitution
nor
this
court's
precedents
require
in
a
federal
prosecution
that
a
general
guilty
verdict
on
a
multiple
object
conspiracy
be
set
aside
if
the
evidence
is
inadequate
to
support
conviction
as
to
one
of
the
objects.
the
due
process
claim
is
not
supported
by
the
historical
practice.
at
common
law,
a
general
verdict
would
be
left
standing
not
only
where
one
of
the
alternative
bases
for
conviction
was
inadequately
supported
by
the
facts
but
even
where
one
was
invalid
at
law.
in
a
case
called
yates
versus
united
states,
we
set
aside
a
general
jury
verdict
in
a
federal
prosecution
because
one
of
the
objects
of
the
conspiracy
was
invalid
at
law,
that
is,
even
if
proven
it
would
not
have
constituted
a
crime.
in
a
later
case,
however,
called
turner
versus
united
states,
we
held
that
when
a
federal
indictment
charges
several
acts
conjunctively,
each
of
which
is
sufficient
to
constitute
a
crime,
a
general
jury
verdict
must
be
sustained
so
long
as
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
establish
one
of
the
acts.
griffin
has
not
set
forth
any
adequate
basis
for
distinguishing
turner
from
cases
such
as
this
one.
moreover,
the
line
between
yates
and
turner
makes
sense.
it
can
be
left
to
jurors
to
determine
which
of
various
alternative
theories
is
supported
by
the
facts.
they
are
good
at
that.
they
are
not
good
at
spotting
theories
that
are
inadequate
in
law.
we
hold,
therefore,
that
although
it
would
be
generally
be
preferable
for
a
district
court
to
give
an
instruction
removing
from
the
jury's
consideration
an
alternative
basis
of
liability
that
does
not
have
adequate
evidentiary
support,
the
refusal
to
do
so
does
not
provide
an
independent
basis
for
reversing
an
otherwise
valid
conviction.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
