justice
stevens
i
am
a
little
puzzled
by
it;
how
far
can
the
president
depart
from
what
the
secretary's
report
would
show?
could
he
just
say,
i
think
i
will
give
massachusetts
three
extra
seats
without
any
factual
basis
or
anything,
just
i
think
that
is
a
good
state
and
they
ought
to
have
three
more
seats.
justice
stevens
but
would
he
have
to
remand
it
in
effect
to
the
secretary
or
could
he
say,
well,
i
have
had
somebody
over
at
the
fbi
making
some
checks
for
me
and
they
tell
me
there
are
really
more
people
in
massachusetts,
so
i
am
going
to
give
them
extra
seats.
justice
stevens
but
what
if
he
didn't,
what
if
he
did
what
i
said?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
the
1790
act?
it
doesn't
just
say
the
place
in
which
he
usually
resides.
it's
the
place
in
which
he
usually
resides
in
the
united
states.
justice
stevens
are
you
saying
that
language
applies
even
though
he
doesn't
usually
reside
in
the
united
states?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
i
understand
your
argument,
but
i
just
don't
think
it
is
supported
by
the
language,
usually
resides
in
the
united
states.
justice
stevens
excuse
me,
and
you
say
that's
not
constitutional?
that
is
not
constitutional--
justice
stevens
--because
i've
never
lived
there.
suppose
i'm
a
college
student
and
my
parents
moved
their
residence
while
i
am
in
college,
and
right
after
college
i
go
abroad
for
several
years,
and
i
list
my
residence
as
my
parents'
new
residence.
is
that
unconstitutional?
could
i
not
be
allocated
to
that
new
residence,
although
i've
never
lived
there?
justice
stevens
are
you
saying
that
the
three...
what
i
would
call
three
alternatives.
they're
not
three
alternatives.
justice
stevens
so
the
duty
under
the
seat
belt
case
is
not
to
consider
an
alternative
but
to
consider
all
alternatives.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
you
said
that
only
massachusetts
has
standing
because
it's
the
436th
seat
and
it'll
take
a
seat
from
washington,
but
why
couldn't
the
error,
if
it
be
an
error,
affect
five
or
six
states?
justice
stevens
why
do
you
say
that?
i
don't
think
the
figures
are
that
clear.
maybe
they
were
on
this
particular
allocation,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
it
would
be
entirely
possible
for
three
or
four
states
to
be
affected
by
an
adjustment
of
the
kind
you
think
might
be
necessary.
justice
stevens
well,
they
had
two
formulas
that
would
have
worked.
justice
stevens
the
one
thing
about
the
home
of
record,
some
of
that
data
is
more
than
10
years
old,
and
how
do
you
respond
to
the
requirement
of
a
census
every
10
years,
his
argument
there?
