justice
souter
mr.
roberts,
may
i
interrupt
you
at
this
point.
i
think
you
have
made
the
point
clear,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
clear
throughout
the
briefs.
i
take
it,
it
is
correct
that
when
a
person
enlists,
that
person
has
no
choice
of
which
state
to
list
his
home
of
record.
it
has
got
to
be
the
state
in
which
the
person
then
legally
resides?
justice
souter
so
that
the
suggestion
that
somebody
could
simply
list
a
state
whose
tax
laws
he
found
attractive
is
not
true?
justice
souter
mr.
roberts,
is
your
argument
undercut
by
the
colloquy
that
massachusetts
sets
out
on
pages
12
and
13
of
its
brief,
which
as
i
read
it
indicates
that
counsel
for
the
government,
counsel
for
your
side
are
saying
that
the
only
so-called
justification
to
remove
the
decision
to
count
based
on
home
of
record
from
the
realm
of
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
is
the
mere
fact
that
mr.
mossbacher
had
made
a
commitment
to
congress
to
count
them.
which
seems
to
say
that
regardless
of
the...
we
are
not
claiming
that
it
is
the
substantial
accuracy
of
the
home
of
record
data
that
rescue
us;
it
is
simply
the
principle
that
we
ought
to
keep
our
word.
justice
souter
well,
on
that
theory,
then,
i
cannot
be
counted
as
a
resident
of
new
hampshire
if
they
happen
to
take
the
census
during
the
term
of
this
court.
justice
souter
do
you
take
it
that
far?
i
mean,
unless
somebody
is
sort
of
literally
there
and
they
can
see--
justice
souter
--okay.
how
far
do
you
go
from
literalism,
then?
justice
souter
so
that
no
data
except
that
gathered
on
essentially
an
account
made
every
10
years
will
ever
suffice
on
your
theory.
