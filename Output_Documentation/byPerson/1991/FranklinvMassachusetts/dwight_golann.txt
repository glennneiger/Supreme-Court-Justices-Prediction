mr.
dwight
golann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
secretary
has
argued
that
he
has
virtually
unbridled
discretion
to
conduct
the
decennial
census
without
review
by
any
court.
we
disagree.
the
apportionment
census
is
carried
out
pursuant
to
specific
constitutional
and
statutory
mandates.
the
constitution
and
the
statutes
which
mirror
its
language
require
three
things
of
the
apportionment
census.
first,
it
requires
an
actual
enumeration.
that
is,
the
secretary
must
actually
count
the
population
on
a
state-by-state
basis.
second,
it
must
be
a
decennial
census.
the
constitution
requires
that
the
census
be
repeated
every
10
years,
so
the
congress
has
a
current,
up-to-date
statement
of
the
distribution
of
the
population
among
the
states
on
which
to
base
apportionment
decisions,
and
finally,
as
i
think
the
parties
agree,
the
apportionment
census
must
be
based
solely
upon
the
number
of
inhabitants
living
in
each
state.
the
possibility
of
considering
citizenship,
voting
population
and
other
criteria
was
explicitly
considered
but
rejected.
all
of
these
criteria...
actual
enumeration,
decenniality,
inhabitancy...
must
be
met
for
an
apportionment
census
to
comply
with
the
constitution.
mr.
dwight
golann
we
believe
so,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
enumeration
has
been
historically
understood
and
applied
consistently
except
for
overseas
employees
in
1970
and
1990
to
require,
as
the
seventh
circuit
recently
observed,
a
head
count
of
the
population,
not
a
statistical
sampling
or
estimation.
i
would
note--
mr.
dwight
golann
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
was
required,
that
there
be
an
enumeration
within
3
years
and
then
each
term
of
10
years
afterwards,
and
that
it
would
be
an
actual
enumeration
seems
to
have
been
understood
by
the
contemporaneous
interpretation
of
the
framers,
who
in
fact
mandated
that
there
be
a
head
count,
and
dis--
mr.
dwight
golann
--through
the
first
census
act
of
1790
passed
by
the
first
congress
in
march
1990,
which
was
implemented
by
a
head
count,
actual
census-taking
of
the
entire
population.
mr.
dwight
golann
we
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
we
note
that
that
was
continued
decade
after
decade.
it
has
been
a
head
count,
as
the
courts
of
appeal
have
noted,
ever
since
then
except
1970
as
to
overseas
employees
and
1990
as
to
overseas
employees.
mr.
dwight
golann
well,
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
is
an
estimate
as
to
where
people
are
residing,
which
is
the
point
of
an
apportionment
census.
mr.
dwight
golann
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
requirement
of
a
decennial
census
requires
an
update
every
10
years.
we
believe,
and
i
might
answer
justice
souter's
question
next,
that
the
defense
department,
the
stipulations,
and
the
court's
opinion,
all
say
that
that...
this
home
of
record
data
might
be
a
place
where
the
employee
had
not
resided
for
many
years
and
in
some
cases
had
not
resided
at
all,
so
it
was
not
an
accurate
statement.
the
entire
rest
of
the
united
states
population
in
1990
was
asked,
who
resides
at
this
address?
who
lives
here
most
of
the
time?
that
question
was
never
asked
of
overseas
federal
employees.
they
were
not
allowed
the
answer
that
question.
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
if
they
did
answer
it,
they
would
have
answered
that
their
usual
residence
is
their
overseas
post,
circulation--
mr.
dwight
golann
--well,
your
honor,
from
the
first
days...
in
fact--
mr.
dwight
golann
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
golann
someone
should
be
counted
at
their
usual
place
of
abode,
was
what
the
first
congress
said,
and
if
they
are
temporarily
absent
they
should
be
counted
at
the
place
they
usually
reside.
most
of
the
population
and
the
particular
overseas
employees
we
have
stipulated
resided
at
their
overseas
post.
there
is
a
subset
of
the
population
that
splits
their
time
between
two
residences.
seafarers,
for
example,
have
a
home
ashore
and
a
berth
aboard
ship.
college
students
are
another
example.
they're
saying,
as
the
first
congress
said,
you
must
be
apportioned
at
your
usual
residence,
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
which
of
two
places
that
you
live
is
your
usual
residence.
that
requires
line-drawing.
i
would
emphasize
there
was
no
line-drawing
in
this
case.
mr.
dwight
golann
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix.
let
me
find
the
quotation.
mr.
dwight
golann
no,
your
honor,
in
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
dwight
golann
--i
believe
there
is
a
direct
quotation.
actually,
your
honor,
it
is
also
quoted
in
the
lower
court's
opinion
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
at
59(a)...
jurisdictional
statement
appendix...
that
every
person
whose
usual
place
of
abode
shall
be
in
any
family
on
aforesaid
first
monday
in
august
next
shall
be
returned
of
such
family,
and
below
it
says
every
person
occasionally
absent,
for
example
on
business
with
the
court,
mr.
justice
souter,
at
the
time
of
the
enumeration
shall
be
returned
as
belonging
to
that
place
in
which
he
usually
resides
in
the
united
states.
so
usual
residence,
the
parties
have
stipulated,
has
been
the
guiding
principle
now
for
200
years,
and
usual
residence
we
have
stipulated
is
the
place
where
a
person
is
living
and
sleeping
most
of
the
time.
that
was
in
fact
line
1
of
the
census
instructions
for
1990,
as
they
appear
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
dwight
golann
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
golann
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
age
of
sail
or
horse,
journeys
were,
of
course,
much
longer
than
they
are
today.
the
criteria
that
has
been
consistently
applied
is,
if
someone
is
away
on
a
trip
and
they
haven't
established
a
dwelling
any
place
else,
then
even
if
they're
gone
for
a
long
time,
they
have
one
dwelling
that
is
at
their
home.
on
the
other
hand,
as
we
have
stipulated,
overseas
employees
had
a
dwelling,
a
place
where
they
usually
resided,
and
it
was
their
overseas
post.
that
is
why,
for
example,
the
domestic
militar,
are
counted
where
they
are.
mr.
dwight
golann
first,
your
honor--
mr.
dwight
golann
--first,
your
honor,
because
that
is
where
they
are
living
and
sleeping
most
of
the
time.
secondly
because
we
have
stipulated
that
that
is
their
dwelling.
as
to
ambassadors,
there
is
a
special
term
of
art.
the
actual
ambassador
residence
is
deemed
to
be
territory
of
the
united
states
just
as
the
french
ambassador's
residence
here
is
deemed
to
be
territory
of
france.
mr.
dwight
golann
no,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
would
violate
the
guiding
principle
of
usual
residence.
mr.
dwight
golann
well,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
has
said,
for
example,
in
the
universal
camera
case
that
it
may
rely
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
may
find--
mr.
dwight
golann
--excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
reason
that
i
referred
to
it
is
because
it
is
the
facts
which
the
justice
department
and
the
massachusetts
attorney
general
agreed
would
provide
a
record
for
the
court
to
make
a
decision,
and
so
we
have
relied
on
them.
some
of
those
stipulations
differ,
for
example,
from
some
of
the
statements
in
the
briefs,
and
so
we
would
ask
the
court
to
at
least
review
the
stipulations
which
we
submitted
is
the
basis
for
a
decision
in
this
case...
we
jointly
submitted.
let
me--
mr.
dwight
golann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
golann
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
if
someone
is
absent
on
a
journey,
as
i
am
in
washington
today,
and
if
it
were
the
census
date
today...
my
usual
residence
is
in
massachusetts--
mr.
dwight
golann
--but
if
i
am
living
abroad,
i've
rented
out
my
home
or
sold
my
home
and
i
have--
mr.
dwight
golann
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
was
designed
for
people
who
are
occasionally
absent
on
a
journey
and
that
is
the
way
it
has
been
interpreted
for
200
years.
that
is
the
way,
for
example,
the
census
bureau
interpreted
in
1990
in
its
official
instructions
where
it
had
said
that
you
should
count
people
that
are
usually
living
in
the
residence
but
not
people
that
are
temporarily
on
a
journey,
on
a
vacation,
in
the
hospital,
on
a
business
trip.
that
has
been
the
consistent
interpretation
of
this
usually...
occasionally
absent
language.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
they
establish
a
dwelling
at
the
place
where
they
travel
on
their
journey
and
give
up
their
dwelling
where
they
were
living
before.
--let
me
note
that
there
is
also
statutory
law
to
apply
in
this
case
for
purposes
of
reviewability.
constitutional
language
is
mirrored
in
statutes.
the
apportionment
act
particularly
requires
that
there
be
a
census,
it
be
carried
out
on
a
decennial
basis,
and
that
quote...
it
provide,
quote,
a
statement
showing
the
whole
number
of
persons
in
each
state,
end
quote,
mirroring
the
language
of
the
14th
amendment.
now,
i
should
note
that
the
lower
court
never
actually
ruled
on
the
constitutional
issue
or
the
statutory
issue
because
it
found
the
secretary's
action
arbitrary
and
capricious.
the
final
decree
contains
no
finding
on
a
ruling
as
to
constitutionality.
in
1990,
the
entire
resident
population
of
the
united
states,
including
the
domestic
military,
i
might
add,
was
apportioned
based
on
questionnaires
asking
them
where
do
you
live
most
of
the
time?
overseas
federal
employees
were
not
apportioned
on
a
basis
consistent
with
the
entire
rest
of
the
united
states
population.
instead,
they
were
apportioned
to
states
based
on
this
home
of
record
file
data.
as
noted,
the
census
bureau
concluded
in
1987
when
formulating
official
rules
for
the
census
that
using
file
data
would
be,
quote,
arbitrary,
end
quote,
and
the
department
of
defense
said
in
1989
to
congress
that
neither
home
of
record
nor
any
of
its
other
file
data,
quote,
meets
a
reasonable
test
of
validity
for
apportionment
purposes.
the
problems
with
home
of
record
which
were
identified
by
the
lower
court
are
also
what
create
the
constitutional
violation
in
this
case.
home
of
record
is
the
state
listed,
for
whatever
motive,
by
an
employee
when
he
or
she
first
enters
the
military.
the
department
of
defense
prohibits
the
employee
from
ever
changing
their
home
of
record
while
they
remain
in
service,
regardless
of
how
their
family
circumstances,
personal
circumstances
may
change.
the
data
may
be
years
or
decades
old,
much
more
than
10
years
old.
the
department
of
defense
testified
to
congress
in
august
1,
1989,
that
the
home
of
record
may
be
a
place
where
the
employee
lived
many
years
ago,
and
in
some
cases
a
place
where
the
employee
never
lived
at
all,
and
that
was
the
testimony
of
the
department
of
defense.
mr.
roberts
is
correct
as
to
the
rule
or
the
question
that
was
asked,
but
the
answers,
as
the
department
of
defense
testified,
varied
quite
a
bit,
and
people
were
apportioned
where
they
had
never
lived.
when
the
secretary
decided
to
change
historic
practice
and
apportion--
mr.
dwight
golann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
golann
i
understand,
your
honor.
the
test
of
inhabitancy
is
where
you
live
and
sleep
most
of
the
time.
where
that
student
in
your
hypothetical
had
never
lived
or
slept
at
that
place...
might
intend
to
reside
there
in
the
future
but
had
not
ever
resided
there
and
was
not
residing
there
on
the
census
date,
so
he
could
not
be
apportioned
to
that
state
under
the
test
set
forth
by
the
census
bureau.
i
might
note
that
when
the
secretary
did
decide
for
the
first...
second
time
to
apportion
overseas
employees
back
to
states,
his
sole
factual
basis
for
doing
so
was
the
department
of
defense
promised
an
actual
enumeration,
but
the
department
of
defense
cancelled
that
promise.
at
that
point,
the
lower
court
said
the
secretary
had
a
legal
obligation
to
at
least
consider
an
important
alternative.
the
alternative...
that
requirement,
rather,
the
court
said,
comes
from
this
court's
decision
in
motor
vehicle
manufacturers,
both
the
majority
and
concurring
opinions.
the
primary
important
alternative
that
the
court
said
the
secretary
ought
to
have
considered
was
returning
to
the
historic
practice,
which
was
to
count
overseas
employees
as
americans,
but
not
apportion
them
back
to
states
where
they
were
not
living.
the
secretary
did
not
consider
any
alternatives.
as
indicated,
he
treated
the
issue
as
solely
one
of
choosing
among
three
kinds
of
file
data,
all
of
which
had
been
condemned
by
both
the
census
bureau
and
the
department
of
defense
within
the
last
year
or
two.
the
lower
court
properly
held--
mr.
dwight
golann
--well,
they
are
three
alternatives,
your
honor,
but
they
miss
one
very
important
alternative,
which
is
not
to
use
file
data
at
all.
mr.
dwight
golann
or
at
least
all
the
important
alternatives,
and
the
obvious
other
alternative
was
returning
to
the
historic
practice,
which
was,
as
i
say,
to
count
them
as
americans...
in
fact,
apportion
them
the
same
way
as
the
domestic
military,
where
they
were
living
on
the
date
of
the
census
and
not
where
they
had
lived
years
or
decades
before.
the
lower
court
concluded
that
this
complete
and
unexplained
failure
to
consider
an
important
alternative
violated
the
standard
of
motor
vehicle
manufacturers
and
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
i
should
note
that
this
court
should
not
be
concerned
with
some
of
the
undesirable
results
that
have
been
suggested
in
the
secretary's
brief.
for
example,
that
every
state
will
file
suit
in
every
decennial
census
if...
or
nearly
all
the
states
if
this
decision
were
upheld.
the
key
to
this
case
is
that
washington
received
the
435th
and
last
seat
awarded
in
the
apportionment.
massachusetts
would
have
received
the
436th
seat.
as
a
result,
massachusetts,
but
not
other
states,
was
able
to
show
causation
and
standing
resulting
from
this
reversal
of
historic
practice.
in
any
particular
decade,
there
might
be
a
handful
of
states
close
enough
to
qualifying
for
that
last
seat
awarded
to
be
able
to
make
out
standing
to
sue.
we
would
also
argue
that--
mr.
dwight
golann
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
emphasize
that
this
case
involves
only
the
constitutional
apportionment
census.
it
is
true
that
the
secretary
conducts
many
other
censuses,
for
example
for
federal
funds.
he
does
not
apply
the
apportionment
standards
to
those
censuses,
nor
need
he.
for
example,
in
1970,
when
overseas
employees
were
apportioned
back
for
state
apportionment
purposes,
their
numbers
were
not
included
in
the
federal
figures
used
to
allocate
aid
to
municipalities.
we
see
no
reason
why
the
secretary
would
have
to
do
that
for
the
nonconstitutional,
entirely
discretionary--
mr.
dwight
golann
--i
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
apportionment
act,
which
contains
the
three
standards
i've
articulated,
only
applies
to
the
apportionment
census.
it
does
not
apply
to
all
these
other
discretionary
censuses.
in
fact,
some
of
them
say
they
should
be
conducted
without
regard
to
the
apportionment
census.
mr.
dwight
golann
that,
and
votes
in
the
electoral
college,
your
honor.
those
are
the
two
purposes
of
the
apportionment
census.
in
1850--
mr.
dwight
golann
--the
secretary
might
have
discretion
if
he
wishes
to
use
it.
i
note
that
in
the
population
totals
for
states,
published
in
1990,
there
are
different
numbers.
there
is
a
resident
population,
and
then
there
is
a
total
population
which
includes
overseas
employees,
and
they
are
different
populations
for
the
same
state,
and
the
secretary,
at
least
in
1970,
did
not
include
overseas
employees
in
the
resident
populations
used
to
allocate
municipal
aid.
that
was
what
was
at
issue,
your
honor,
in
borough
of
bethel
park
v.
stans,
and
the
third
circuit
held
he
need
not,
so
we
don't
see
any
connection
between
the
constitutional
census
and
all
of
the
other
surveys
that
the
secretary
has
conducted
and
as
to
which
he
enjoys
very
wide
discretion,
perhaps
unreviewable
discretion.
mr.
dwight
golann
it
is
conceivable
that
there
might
be
some
sort
of
earthquake
in
the
census.
it
would
have
to
be
an
illegal
earthquake.
it
would
have
to
be
exceedingly
widespread
in
order
to
affect
states
that
are
many,
many
places
away
from
qualifying
for
the
last
seat.
under
the
very
discretionary--
mr.
dwight
golann
--the
universe
might
be,
i
would
suggest,
perhaps
five
or
six
or
half-dozen.
for
example,
montana
was
the
441st,
i
believe,
but
they
had
to
advocate
a
formula
that
had
never
been
used
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
in
order
to
make
out
a
case
of
standing,
find
a
formula
that
would
produce
entitlement
to
that
seat.
mr.
dwight
golann
well,
i
don't
believe
either
one
had
ever
been
used,
and
that
illustrates
the
problems
when
you
are
very
far
away
from
qualifying
for
the
last
seat.
the
legal
theory
has
to
be
increasingly
unusual.
we
simply
don't
see
any
reasonable
likelihood
that
a
state
could
make
out
a
case
of
standing.
mr.
dwight
golann
your
honor,
i
would
have
two
concerns.
one
is
that
the
constitution
specifically
requires
an
updating
every
10
years.
under
the
theory
that
the
secretary
applied
to
overseas
employees,
he
could
cancel
the
entire
1990
census,
say
we'll
use
1980
data,
it's
better
than
nothing,
we'll
adjust
it
5
percent,
and
that
will
be
our
apportionment
count.
that
would
clearly
not
be
a
decennial
census,
and
that
is
essentially
what
happened
for
overseas
employees
in
this
case.
mr.
dwight
golann
they
do,
your
honor,
and
they
ask
very
specific
questions,
and
they
check
the
forms
against
each
other,
as
you
will
find
in
the
official
forms.
it's
really
quite
precise.
they
do
not
do
an
overcount
or
undercount
or
a
statistical
adjustment.
at
least,
no
court
has
every
ordered
the
secretary
to
do
so.
it
is
a
head
count.
it
is
done
not
by
touching
shoulders
but
by--
mr.
dwight
golann
--i
believe
it
occurs
over
a
few
days
in
april
of
1990.
at
least,
that's
what
the
instructions
say
in
the
joint
appendix.
this
data,
i
might
note,
was
not...
the
selection
wasn't
made
until
july
of
1990,
and
our
concern,
for
example,
if
there
were
no
reviewability,
is
that
a
future
secretary
could
sit
down,
having
received
the
census
results,
knowing
what
they
show,
choosing
among
three
forms
of
file
data
that
he
or
she
would
know
would
throw
a
seat
to
one
state
or
to
another
state
and
might
succumb
to
partisan
political
concerns
to
move
a
seat,
and
under
the
government's
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
that
would
not
be
reviewable
by
any
court,
and
that
is
very
troubling.
i
should
note
that,
your
honor,
one
other
concern
raised
in
the
briefs
were
that
americans
would
be
thrown
out
of
the
census
counts,
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
these
americans
were
counted
as
citizens.
they
were
counted
in
the
same
way
that
the
domestic...
or
should
have
been
counted,
would
be
counted
under
the
court's
order
in
the
same
way
domestic
military
were
counted...
that
is,
at
the
base
where
they
are
serving,
and
not
apportioned
back
to
where
they
lived
before
they
joined
military
service.
they
would
be
apportioned
in
the
same
way
as
residents
of
the
district
of
columbia,
of
guam,
and
other
dependencies.
mr.
dwight
golann
the
standards,
your
honor...
they
might
or
might
not.
the
standards
under
the
absentee
voting
act
are
inconsistent
with
the
standards
the
secretary
used
in
this
case.
that
is,
the
standards
in
the
absentee
voting
act
are...
there
are
various
standards.
one
is
domicile,
and
so
it
is
quite
possible,
and
we
think
undoubted,
that
some
people
were
apportioned
to
states
different
than
the
states
in
which
they
had
voted
and--
mr.
dwight
golann
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
golann
that,
your
honor,
was
decided
by
this
court
in
carrington
v.
rash.
in
that
case,
the
state
of
texas
said
you
are
inflexibly
allocated
to
the
state
you
indicate
when
you
enter
military
service.
sergeant
carrington
was
told
that
because
he
had
indicated
a
certain
residence
17
years
before,
he
couldn't
vote
in
texas
even
though
his
domicile
was
there.
this
court
held
that
allocating
inflexibly
people
to
states
based
on,
i
think
it
was
home
of
record
in
that
case,
was
irrational
and
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
that
does
not
directly
control
this
case,
but
we
find
it
a
useful
analogy,
because
it
indicates
the
problems
with
this
data
and
the
problems
with
an
inflexible
application
of
stale
data,
in
that
case
17-year-old
data.
your
honor,
i
would
note
again
that
this
issue
of
decenniality,
as
we
call
it,
is
very
important.
the
framers
made
a
conscious
decision
to
have
a
census
recount
every
10
years.
they
saw
the
example
of
the
english
parliament,
which
had
so-called
rotten
boroughs
where
there
was
not
a
recount,
stale
data,
and
the
population
moved
greatly,
and
they
wanted
an
up-to-date,
in
effect
a
snapshot
of
the
american
population
as
of
april
1st.
home
of
record
doesn't
give
that
snapshot.
as
we
say,
it
shows
at
most
where
people
lived
years
before,
and
in
some
cases
where
they
didn't
live
at
all.
it
violates
the
core
requirement
of
a
decennial
census.
mr.
dwight
golann
your
honor--
mr.
dwight
golann
--no,
your
honor,
but
they
move
around,
and
in
this
voluntary
army--
mr.
dwight
golann
--no,
but
they
move
from
one--
mr.
dwight
golann
--your
honor,
i
don't
know,
and
i'd
have
to
refer
to
personal
experience,
which
i
don't
wish
to.
mr.
dwight
golann
that's
right.
if
they
are--
mr.
dwight
golann
--the
problem
with
home
of
record
is--
mr.
dwight
golann
--well,
your
honor,
the
record--
mr.
dwight
golann
--yes,
it
will,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
golann
no,
because
it's
a
record...
it's
not
where
they
lived
just
before
they
left
the
united
states.
mr.
dwight
golann
your
honor,
i
believe--
mr.
dwight
golann
that's
just
plain
inaccuracy.
mr.
dwight
golann
--it
is
where
they
lived
when
they
first
entered
the
military,
and
if
they
entered
the
military
10
or
15
years
before,
it's
where
they
lived
10
or
15
years
before,
not
the
last
place
they
lived
in
the
united
states
before
going
overseas,
not
the
place
they're
going
to
go
back
to,
and
when
they
return,
your
honor,
again
the--
mr.
dwight
golann
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
golann
indeed,
he
would
have
to
be,
because
he
could
not
change
the
home
of
record
until
he
broke
military
service,
left
the
military
for
at
least
one
day
and
then
after
being
out
of
the
military,
if
he
reenlisted
he
could
name
again,
but
otherwise
not.
mr.
dwight
golann
if
he
were
in
this--
mr.
dwight
golann
--no.
mr.
dwight
golann
your
honor,
if
he
were
in
the
domestic
military--
mr.
dwight
golann
--that's
correct.
if
a
person
from
massachusetts
enlisted
in
the
military
is
sent
to
fort
benning,
he
will
be
counted
in
georgia
as
an
inhabitant
of
georgia.
if
he's
sent
to
wiesbaden,
germany
under
this
ruling
he's
counted
to
his
home
of
record.
if
it's
massachusetts,
it's
massachusetts.
if
he
decided
he
wanted
to
move
to
hawaii
when
he
left
the
service,
it
would
be
hawaii,
whatever
he
listed,
and
he
could
not
change
it.
i
should...
i
will
simply
state
in
conclusion
that
there
are
really
two
ways
to
look
at
this
case.
the
secretary
argues
that
this
is
a
mere
choice
of
data,
that
if
the
court
accepts
this
characterization
it
should
find
for
the
secretary.
we
believe
this
case
arises
with
constitutional
and
statutory
claims
that
involve
issues
of
enumeration,
decenniality,
and
inhabitancy,
none
of
which
were
satisfied
by
the
use
of
stale
and
outdated
file
data.
we
also
believe,
as
the
lower
court
found,
that
the
secretary
refused
to
consider
important
alternatives,
such
as
returning
to
historic
practice.
these
troops
should
have
been
counted
the
same
way
the
domestic
military
were
counted.
they
should
have
been
counted
where
they
were,
where
they
were
living,
and
not
in
states
which
they
weren't
residing.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
submit.
mr.
dwight
golann
he
should
not
have
used
home
of
record
data.
mr.
dwight
golann
he
should
have
enumerated--
mr.
dwight
golann
--he
should
have
conducted
an
actual
enumeration
and
asked
the
question
your
honor
posed,
where
do
you
plan
to
live
when
you
come
back?
mr.
dwight
golann
if
there
is
no
time
now,
in
that
case
they
should
not
be
counted...
or
not
apportioned
back
to
states
at
all.
mr.
dwight
golann
that
is
preferable
because
the
decennial
census
is
a
snapshot,
and
a
snapshot
of
the
population
on
april
1990,
and
that
didn't
happen.
mr.
dwight
golann
because
for
one
thing
it
involves
the
problem...
and
this
was
the
reason
for
some
other
variations
from
usual
residence
of
double
counting.
people
would
be
counted
one
place
in
1990,
they'd
be
counted
a
different
place
in
1992,
and
that
would
be
one
problem.
the
other
problem,
i
believe,
your
honor,
would
be
that
as
a
practical
matter
it
couldn't
happen.
you
will
note
in
the
record
that
when
the
secretary
did
conduct
a
minor
enumeration
of
60,000
civilian
employees,
only
20
percent
of
them
ever
returned
their
questionnaires.
now
that
they
have
left
the
military
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
i
suspect
the
response
rate
will
be
so
low
that
it
will
simply
not
be
an
enumeration.
mr.
dwight
golann
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is,
to
us,
the
meaning
of
the
decennial
census.
