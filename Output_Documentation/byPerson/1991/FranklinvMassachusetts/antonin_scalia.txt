justice
scalia
mr.
roberts,
i
know
the
president
is
not
covered
by
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
do
you
really
think
that
that
means
that
there
is
no
review
whatever
of
presidential
actions?
i
mean,
can
the
president
do
anything
at
all
and
you
say
it
is
not
reviewable
because
the
apa
doesn't
cover
him?
justice
scalia
i
agree,
he
is
not
reviewable
under
the
apa,
but
might
he
not
be
reviewable
in
some
other
fashion?
justice
scalia
when
the
apa
refers
to
agency
action,
don't
you
think
it
means
action
binding
upon
private
individuals
somehow?
i
always
thought
that
is
what
it
meant.
can
it
be
the
filing
of
a
report
with
somebody
else,
even
the
filing
of
a
report
by
the
president
with
congress,
does
that
constitute
agency
action?
justice
scalia
before
you
get...
just
one
more
thing
about
this
series
from
the
census
to
the
president
to
the
congress.
you
say
if
congress
doesn't
like
what
the
president
gives
them,
the
congress
doesn't
have
to
accept
it.
is
there
any
way
that
congress
can
not
accept
it
except
by
passing
a
new
law?
justice
scalia
both
houses,
plus
the
concurrence
of
the
president?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
but
no
single
house
of
congress
can
just
look
at
this
stuff
from
the
president
and
say
this
is
junk,
and
we
are
not
going
to
proceed
on
this
basis.
justice
scalia
you
have
a
lot
of
time.
i
have
one
more
question.
when
you
say
that
the
president's
action
is...
is
it
that
the
president's
actions
are
not
reviewable
or
that
you
simply
cannot
bring
a
suit
directly
against
the
president?
suppose
i
am
in
jail
by
direct
order
of
the
president.
you
don't
mean
that
i
can't
get
habeas
corpus
simply
because
the
action
of
the
president
is
not
reviewable,
do
you?
justice
scalia
against
the
prison
warden.
the
action
would
have
to
be
against
the
warden,
but
the
president's
action
would
be
reviewable.
justice
scalia
in
what
respect
is
this
not
a
head
count?
this
isn't
an
estimate.
they
are
using
actual--
justice
scalia
--it's
where
they
said...
they
said
they
resided
on
the
basis
of
the
last
information
we
had.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
that
all
depends
upon
what
you
mean
by
occasionally
absent.
yes.
justice
scalia
if
occasionally
absent
includes
absence
of
years,
then
most
of
the
time
means
most
of
the
time
when
he's
not
absent,
and
that
could
mean
many
years
ago,
couldn't
it?
justice
scalia
why
is
their
overseas
post
their
dwelling
any
more
than
the
spanish
ambassador's
residence
was
his
dwelling?
i
don't
understand
why
that's
the
dwelling.
justice
scalia
they're
assigned
there,
just
as
the
spanish
ambassador
is
assigned
there.
they
have
to
be
there,
and
when
they're
out
of
the
army
they
expect
to
go
back
to
where
they
reside...
to
new
hampshire
or
wherever.
justice
scalia
oh,
so
all
we
have
to
do
is
call
u.s.
bases
abroad...
we
can
deem
them
to
be
territory
of
the
united
states
and
you'll
be
happy.
justice
scalia
well,
i
mean
that's
a
fiction.
surely
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
also,
we
grant
certiorari
in
cases
to
review
undecided
questions
of
law.
we
don't
regard
ourselves
as
bound
by
any
sort
of
a
stipulation
that
could
affect
a
question
of
law.
justice
scalia
mr.
golann,
suppose
i
disagree
with
you
that
somebody
residing
abroad
can't
be
counted
so
long
as
he
intends
to
return
to
the
united
states
and
intends
to
return
to
a
particular
place.
assume
that
i
disagree
with
that,
but
assume
also
that
i
am
concerned
that
this
data
is
pretty
stale,
that
they
said
they
were
going
to
return
to
this
place
20
years
ago.
it
may
be
pretty
bad
data,
but
it
may
be
better
than
any
other
data
that
we
have.
i
mean,
why
is
it
arbitrary
to
say,
it's
all
we
got?
it's
certainly
going
to
be
more
accurate
than
not
counting
these
people
at
all.
it
may
be
wrong
two
times
out
of
five,
but
if
you
don't
count
them
at
all,
you're
going
to
be
wrong
more
than
that.
justice
scalia
well,
it's...
you
mean
there
are
no
estimates
made
in
the
census
at
all?
the
census-takers
goes
and
they
lay
their
hands
on
shoulder
by
shoulder?
don't
they
ask
people,
how
many
people
in
the
house,
things
of
that
sort?
justice
scalia
how
long
does
the
process
take?
justice
scalia
what
if
i
think
they
should
have
been
counted
where
they
intended
to
reside
when
they
came
back
to
the
united
states?
then
what
should
the
secretary
have
done?
justice
scalia
i
know
that.
justice
scalia
i
know
you
believe
that.
what
do
you
believe
he
should
have
done?
justice
scalia
what
if
there
was
no
time
to
do
that?
justice
scalia
at
all.
why
is
that
preferable?
justice
scalia
why
is
that
snapshot
closer
to...
in
focus
than
the
snapshot
of
using
stale
data
but
at
least
some
data?
justice
scalia
--i
think
mr.
golann
is
saying
inaccuracy
in
not
counting
is
okay.
if
you
don't
want
to
spend
money,
you
don't
count.
so
long
as
you
don't
put
any
noses
in
there
that
you
haven't
counted,
it's
okay.
do
you
know
of
any
other
instances
where
the
secretary
saves
money
by
being
a
little
inaccurate,
by
counting
noses
that
he
shouldn't
count?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
fine,
but
those
are
noses
you
haven't
counted.
that's
okay.
