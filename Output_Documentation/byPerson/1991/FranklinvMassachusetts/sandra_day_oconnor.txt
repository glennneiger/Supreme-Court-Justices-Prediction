justice
o'connor
mr.
roberts,
as
i
understand
the
respondents
in
their
briefs,
they
also
make
a
claim
that
the
constitution
itself
is
violated,
and
i
suppose
that
would
have
to
be
resolved
apart
from
any
apa
claim.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
does
the
constitution
mean
in
requiring
an
enumeration
and
in
referring
to
the
whole
number
of
persons?
what
do
you
suppose
that
meaning
is?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
secretary
were
to
do
some
wholly
arbitrary
act
like
counting
people
who
live
in
massachusetts
as
part
of
the
population
of
the
state
of
washington?
justice
o'connor
yes--
justice
o'connor
mr.
golann,
would
massachusetts
count
for
purposes
of
allowing
them
to
vote
military
personnel
with
a
home
of
record
in
massachusetts?
justice
o'connor
but
also,
i
suppose,
true
that
some
people
with
a
home
of
record
in
massachusetts
would
be
allowed
to
vote
there--
justice
o'connor
--even
though
massachusetts
is
here
saying
you
can't
count
them
for
apportionment
purposes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
is
franklin
versus
massachusetts
which
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
district
of
massachusetts.
the
district
court's
judgment
directed
federal
officials
to
reform
the
1990
census
and
to
reapportion
congressional
representatives
accordingly
giving
one
more
representative
to
massachusetts
and
one
less
to
washington
state.
the
federal
officials
who
determined
the
census
and
reapportionment
appealed
from
that
judgment.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse.
the
constitution
requires
that
the
apportionment
or
representatives
be
redetermined
every
10
years
by
an
actual
enumeration
of
persons
in
each
state.
after
the
secretary
of
commerce
takes
the
census,
she
reports
the
tabulation
to
the
president.
he,
intern,
sends
congress
a
statement
showing
the
number
of
persons
in
each
state
and
he
determines
according
to
a
calculation
prescribed
by
statute
the
number
of
representatives
to
which
each
state
will
be
entitled.
in
1990,
for
only
the
second
time
since
1900,
the
census
bureau
allocated
the
department
of
defense's
overseas
employees
to
particular
states
for
reapportionment
purposes.
the
allocation
of
these
employees
changed
the
relative
state
population
counts
enough
to
give
washington
one
more
representative
and
massachusetts
one
less.
at
least,
massachusetts
and
two
of
its
registered
voters
filed
an
action
against
census
bureau
officials,
the
secretary
of
commerce,
and
the
president
among
others,
challenging
the
counting
of
overseas
employees
as
contrary
to
the
constitution
and
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
violation
of
standard
set
by
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
district
court
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
claims
but
found
the
census
bureau's
decision
to
allocate
overseas
employees
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
we
hold,
first,
that
the
district
court
erred
in
reviewing
the
administrative
procedure
act
claims
because
there
is
no
final
agency
action
at
issue
here.
the
final
action
that
determines
the
reapportionment
is
the
president's
statement
to
congress,
not
the
secretary's
census
count.
up
until
the
time
that
the
president
informs
congress
of
the
new
apportionment,
the
census
figures
are
subject
to
change
and,
if
not,
settle
the
reapportionment.
and
the
president's
action,
while
final,
is
not
subject
to
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
because
the
president
is
not
expressly
included
within
the
act's
definition
of
agency.
respect
for
the
separation
of
powers
and
the
president's
unique
constitutional
role
makes
textural
silence
insufficient
to
subject
the
president's
statutory
duties
to
administrative
procedure
act
review.
second,
we
hold
that
massachusetts'
constitutional
claim
falls
on
the
merits.
the
decision
to
allocate
overseas
federal
employees
to
their
home
states
is
consistent
with
the
constitutional
language
and
the
goal
of
equal
representation.
it
is
also
compatible
with
the
standard
of
usual
residence
which
was
the
phrase
used
in
the
first
enumeration
act
and
which
has
been
used
by
the
bureau
ever
since
to
allocate
persons
to
their
home
states.
the
phrase
has
carried
broad
connotations
of
enduring
ties
to
a
place
and
allows
for
temporary
absences
from
a
state
especially
those
compelled
by
government
service.
those
serving
the
united
states
abroad
may
constitutionally
be
included
in
the
enumeration
of
their
home
states
and
may
be
represented
in
congress.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
blackmun,
kennedy,
and
souter
have
joined;
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
