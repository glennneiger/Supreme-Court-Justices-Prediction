justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
no.
91-1502,
barbara
franklin,
secretary
of
commerce
v.
massachusetts.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
golann,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
word
actual
in
the
constitution
changes
the
meaning
of
enumeration
and
gives
that
noun
a
meaning
it
wouldn't
otherwise
have
if
the
word
actual
weren't
in
front
of
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
if
you
take
the
language
leading
up
to
it
in
article
1,
section
2,
and
it
talks
about
representatives
and
direct
taxes
shall
be
apportioned
among
the
several
states
which
may
be
included
within
this
union
according
to
the
respective
numbers
which
shall
be
determined...
determined
at...
and
this
is
the
actual
enumeration...
it
seems
to
me
you
can
use
the
word...
read
the
word
actual
as
simply
indicating
when
it
actually
comes
to
enumerating
rather
than
modifying
the
word
enumeration
the
way
you
say
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
did
they
mandate
that
there
be
a
head
count?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
say
because
that
was
the
first
congress
they
probably
reflected
what
the
constitution
intended.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
exactly
was
it...
what
is
the
actual
language
used
by
the
first
congress
on
which
you're
relying?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
the
grey...
the
grey
volume.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
brown
volume.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
have
constantly
talked
about
stipulations.
if
you're
talking
about
a
finding
of
the
district
court
which
we
would
not
upset
unless
it's
clearly
erroneous,
that
may
be
something
different.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
golann,
how
about
any
number
of
other
entities
such
as
counties
or
school
districts
which
may
depend
on
census
data
for
federal
funding?
i
mean,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
to
just
be
a
controversy
over
the
apportionment
seats.
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
we
reasonably
differentiate,
though,
the
kind
of
census
you're
talking
about
from
the
other
kinds
of
census
that
these
other
groups
justifiably
rely
on?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
nothing
but
the
apportionment
of
the
house
of
representatives
depends
on
the
apportionment
act
census?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
not
used,
then,
for
any
other
purposes,
for
allocating
any
sort
of
funds
at
all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
golann.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
