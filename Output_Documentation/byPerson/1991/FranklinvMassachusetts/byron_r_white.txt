justice
white
well,
it
would
be
rare
that
military
people
have
that
kind
of
staleness.
justice
white
military
people
ordinarily
don't
stay
overseas
forever.
justice
white
well,
you
think
a
very
high
percentage
of
military
people
stay
out
of
the
united
states
for
15
years?
justice
white
all
right.
they
may
move
around
overseas,
but
how
long
do
you
think
they...
on
the
average
they
would
be
overseas
out
of
this
country?
justice
white
well,
when
they
come
back
they're
going
to
be
counted
where
they
live.
justice
white
they
won't
be
any
longer
any
problem
about
them,
but
when
they're
overseas
for
4
years,
what's
wrong
with
the
home
of
record?
justice
white
certainly
it
won't
be
staleness,
will
it?
justice
white
well,
will
it,
or
not?
justice
white
what,
4
years
stale,
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
that
isn't
staleness.
that
isn't
the
problem
about
staleness.
justice
white
you
think
a
military
person
who
enters
and
has
a
home
of
record,
and
he
might
have
established
a
domicile
while
he's
in
the
service
in
some
other
state--
justice
white
--and
he
would
still
be
counted
if
he
went
overseas
as
being
in
the
state
of
his
home
of
record.
justice
white
so
he
might
have
been
counted
a
couple
of
times
in
some
other
state
while
he
was
in
the
military
in
this
country.
justice
white
he
might
have
been
counted
in
a
couple
of--
justice
white
--states
other
than
his
home
of
record.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
mr.
roberts,
do
you
think
we
have
to
vote
this
method
of
enumeration
up
or
down
to
decide
this
case?
justice
white
what
if
we
don't
agree
with
that?
couldn't
we
say...
couldn't
we
decide
this
case
by
saying
that
well,
it
may
be
all
right,
but
the
secretary
has
not
done
a
very
good
job
of
telling
us
why,
and
then
we
would
just
send
it
back.
justice
white
yes,
all
right.
all
right.
i
know
the
united
states
position
is
that
it
was
the
wrong
remedy--
justice
white
--and
it
should
have
been
remanded,
but
we
could
remand
without
deciding
whether
this
home
of
record
approach
is
correct.
justice
white
i
understand
that.
i
take
it
you
wouldn't
be
satisfied
if
we
just
did
that.
you'd
rather
have
some
other
decision
than
just--
justice
white
justice
o'connor
has
three
cases
to
announce.
