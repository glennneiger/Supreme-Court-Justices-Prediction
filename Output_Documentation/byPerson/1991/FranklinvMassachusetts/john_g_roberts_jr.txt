mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts.
that
court
ruled
that
the
secretary
of
commerce
could,
consistent
with
the
constitution
and
the
census
act,
include
federal
personnel
stationed
abroad,
primarily
servicemen
and
servicewomen,
in
the
state-by-state
apportionment
count
on
which
the
allocation
of
representatives
is
based.
the
court
went
on,
however,
to
hold
that
the
secretary's
method
for
doing
so
with
respect
to
the
1990
census
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
in
violation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
secretary
relied
primarily
on
home
of
record
data
in
defense
department
files,
as
had
been
done
in
1970.
home
of
record
is
a
serviceman's
actual
home
at
time
of
enlistment
and
it
is
where
the
military
will
return
him
when
he
is
discharged.
based
on--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
instructions
say
you
must
list
your
permanent
home
or
actual
home
at
time
of
enlistment.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
is
not
true.
taxation
is
treated
with
a
different
concept,
legal
residence.
someone
can
have
a
home
state
in
one
state
and
declare
a
legal
residence
for
tax
purposes
elsewhere.
but
the
suggestion
that
home
of
record
is
subject
to
manipulation
for
tax
purposes
is
not
true.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
joint
appendix,
page
151
where
that
is
clarified.
now,
based
on
its
finding
of
a
violation,
the
district
court
ordered
the
executive
branch
defendants
not
to
count
the
nearly
1
million
federal
personnel
stationed
abroad
in
the
apportionment
count
at
all.
it
ordered
that
a
new
statement
be
sent
to
congress
specifying
the
number
of
representatives
to
which
each
state
is
entitled,
and
it
ordered
the
clerk
of
the
house
to
send
to
the
governors
new
certificates
telling
them
how
many
representatives
their
states
were
entitled
to.
if
allowed
to
stand,
the
decision
below
will
shift
a
representative
from
the
state
of
washington
to
massachusetts,
only
the
second
time
in
the
200-year
history
of
the
census
that
any
such
relief
has
been
ordered.
the
first
time
was
last
fall
with
the
district
court's
decision
in
the
montana
case
which
this
court
reversed
last
month.
the
decision
here
should
meet
the
same
fate:
first,
because
judicial
review
is
unavailable
under
the
apa;
second,
even
if
review
is
available,
the
secretary's
decision
to
allocate
personnel
abroad
to
their
home
of
record
is
not
arbitrary
and
capricious;
and
third,
even
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
apa,
the
appropriate
remedy
is
a
remand
to
the
secretary,
not
judicial
reapportionment
of
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
constitutional
claims
are
also
barred
by
the
commitment
of
this
matter
to
the
secretary's
discretion.
we
recognize
that
this
court
in
webster
against
doe
indicated
that
there
may
be
a
higher
level
that
needs
to
be
shown.
but
in
webster,
the
constitutional
claim
was
a
personal
right,
extrinsic
if
you
will,
from
the
matter
that
congress
had
insulated
from
judicial
review.
here,
that
is
not
the
case.
the
constitutional
claim
and
the
statutory
claim
are
in
large
part
indistinguishable.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
assuming
there
is
review,
an
enumeration
is
exactly
what
took
place
in
this
case.
the
secretary
didn't
estimate
the
number
of
servicepeople
abroad.
it
didn't
take
a
sample
and
then
extrapolate
from
that.
the
secretary
counted
them,
918,810,
not
809
and
not
811.
now,
the
secretary
counted
them
from
forms,
but
that
is
how
the
census
is
conducted
by
and
large.
when
you
get
a
census
form
in
the
mail,
it
asks
you
to
fill
it
out,
or
the
head
of
the
household,
and
state
how
many
people
are
living
at
that
home.
you
list
yourself,
a
spouse,
three
children,
the
form
is
returned.
the
census
bureau
counts
from
that
form,
but
that
is
still
an
actual
enumeration.
and
indeed,
historically,
it
was
considered
sufficient,
for
example
in
the
case
of
a
prison,
to
ask
the
warden
how
many
prisoners
were
there,
or
significantly,
in
the
case
of
a
military
base,
to
rely
on
data
provided
by
the
commander.
and
even
if,
in
the
normal
case,
if
the
census
bureau
has
trouble
reaching
someone,
they
will
go
and
ask
the
neighbors,
who
lives
there,
how
many
people?
it
is
still
an
actual
enumeration.
it
is
not
an
estimate.
the
other
constitutional
provision
to
which
you
referred,
the
original
clause,
the
respective
numbers
of
the
states,
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
each
state,
i
think
both
sides
agree
that
what
the
framers
are
referring
to
are
inhabitants.
and
the
question
is,
is
it
rational
to
conclude,
using
the
words
of
the
first
census
act
and
the
census
clause,
that
servicemen
abroad
can
still
be
considered
as
belonging
to
the
respective
numbers
of
their
home
states.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
clear.
madison
knew
what
an
inhabitant
was.
he
was
involved
in
drafting
the
census
act,
and
he
said
it
includes
someone
who
is
absent
for
a
considerable
period
on
public
business,
certainly
an
apt
description
of
our
troops
abroad.
it
was
tested
in
the
case-of
minister
forsythe
in
1824,
our
minister
to
spain
who
was
elected
from
georgia
to
the
house.
his
election
was
challenged.
it
said,
you
are
not
an
inhabitant
of
georgia.
you
have
been
in
spain,
and
the
house
said,
his
absence
abroad
on
public
business
did
not
deprive
him
of
the
status
of
an
inhabitant,
and
the
same
should
be
true
of
a
private
serving
overseas
in
korea.
the
review
of
both
the
constitutional
claims
and
the
administrative
law
claims
is
barred
by
the
census
act.
the
apa
says
that
if
a
matter
is
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law,
there
is
no
review.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
in
any
case
in
which
the
argument
is
that
judicial
review
is
precluded,
you
can
come
up
with
hypotheticals
that
seem
to
call
for
corrective
action.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
is
not
enough
to
establish
that
the
exception
to
review
doesn't
apply
or
otherwise
it
would
never
apply.
for
example,
there
is
an
exception
to
judicial
review
this
court
recognized
in
webster.
now
if
the
director
of
the
cia
decided
that
every
left-handed
person
was
a
threat
to
national
security
and
dismissed
them,
that
would
be
absurd,
but
it
still
would
not
be
subject
to
review.
one
point
that
is
important
to
consider
in
discussing
this
is
how
likely
is
it
that
the
absurd
or
extreme
case
will
go
uncorrected.
we
think
that
this
is
a
situation
in
which
that
is
extremely
unlikely.
congress
pays
attention
to
the
conduct
of
the
census
very
carefully,
too
carefully
i
think
according
to
my
brother,
and
they
certainly
pay
attention
to
the
reapportionment
of
the
house
of
representatives.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
political
branches
can
be
expected
to
correct
for
extreme
cases
of
the
sort
you
hypothesized.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
am
not
sure.
the
only
conceivable
final
agency
action
is
the
secretary's
report
to
the
president
of
the
tabulation
of
population
by
states,
which
certainly
doesn't
provide
a
suitable
case
for
judicial
review.
all
that
is
required
is
a
document
stating
massachusetts
has
15
million
people--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--absolutely;
he
has
the
obligation
to
take
care
that
the
law
be
faithfully
executed.
he
could
decide,
he
could
be,
say
i
have
always
believed
that
the
usual
residence
rule
should
never
be
departed
from
and
i
disagree.
send
me
some
statistics
without
apportioning
servicemen
abroad.
he
has
that
obligation.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
except
that
the
president
is
not
an
agency
subject
to
suit
under
the
apa,
and
i
don't
understand
massachusetts
to
challenge
that
submission
here.
the
next
step
would
be
congress,
and
that
is
how
the
process
has
traditionally
operated.
the
president
submits
his
statement.
congress
has
a
period
in
which
it
can
consider
that
statement
and
take
legislative
action
if
it
wishes.
it
did
not
decide
to
take
any
action
in
this
case.
the
action
they
took
years
ago
in
the
census
act
was
to
specify
that
the
conduct
of
the
census,
the
secretary
will
conduct
the
census
in
such
form
and
content
as
he
may
determine,
pursuant
to
the
constitutional
grant
to
congress
to
conduct
the
census
in
such
manner
as
they
shall
by
law
direct.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--theoretically,
in
a
purely
ministerial
task,
by
mandamus,
but
this
is
not
a
purely
ministerial
task,
and
there
is
no
suggestion
that
there
is
any
other
basis
for
suit
here,
other
than
the
apa.
so
his
part
in
this
process,
which
is
key,
the
secretary's
statement
doesn't
entitle
a
state
to
anything.
it
is
the
president's
statement
by
law
which
entitles
a
state
to
that
number
of
representatives
unless
changed
by
congress.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
in
the
sense,
for
example,
as
the
court
discussed
in
the
luhan
case,
it
does
have
to
have
an
effect.
the
secretary's
report
of
population
doesn't
affect
legal
rights
of
any
individuals
or
of
the
states.
it
is
the
president's
statement
that
gives
the
states
an
entitlement
to
a
certain
number
of
representatives,
and
yet
that
is
insulated
from
review
under
the
apa.
now
the
district--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
law
directs
him
to
apply,
of
course,
a
particular
mathematical
formula
to
the
population
figures
he
receives,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
a
limit
on
his
exercise
of
authority
to
direct
the
secretary
of
commerce
to
conduct
the
census
in
a
particular
manner.
it
would
be
unlawful,
maybe
not
subject
to
judicial
review,
but
unlawful
just
to
say,
these
are
the
figures,
they
are
right,
but
i
am
going
to
submit
a
different
statement.
but
he
can
certainly
direct
the
secretary
in
the
conduct
of
the
census.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
under
the
law
he
is
supposed
to
base
his
calculation
on
the
figures
submitted
by
the
secretary.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
again,
the
manner
of
review
is
established
in
the
statute.
his
statement
goes
to
congress
where
it
stays
until
congress
by
subsequent
statute
changes
the
entitlement
in
his
statement,
that
is
spelled
out
in
the
law,
and
that
indicates
that
that
is
the
mechanism
for
review,
not
judicial
review
of
any
of
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
judgments
that
went
into
the
underlying
census
figures.
now
the
district--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
it
would
not
because
he
is
not
an
agency
subject
to
review
under
the
apa.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
not
pursuant
to
the
administrative
procedures
act,
pursuant
to
another--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
that
is
right,
because
the
statutory
scheme
which
indicates
his
statement
is
to
go
before
congress--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
is
conclusive
unless
reviewed
by
congress,
and
my
submission
is
that
by
providing
for
a
special
mechanism
for
congressional
review,
and
the
historical
fact
that
that
is
how
congress
has
reviewed
it,
indicates
an
intent
to
preclude
review
of
that
interim
step
in
the
transmission
process.
now,
the
district
court
in
this
case
relied
heavily
on
the
usual
residence
concept
for
its
law
to
apply,
the
concept
that
people
should
be
counted
for
purposes
of
the
census
where
they
live
and
sleep
most
of
the
time
as
of
census
day.
historically,
there
have
been
exceptions
to
that
principle
time
and
time
again.
boarding
school
students
are
not
counted
where
they
live
and
sleep
most
of
the
time,
they
are
counted
at
their
family
home.
the
same
was
true
for
college
students
from
1900
to
1940--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
the
requirement
is
for
them
to
pass
a
new
law.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
now
that
is
a
way,
of
course,
that
congress
can
change
anything,
by
passing
a
law.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
however,
they
have
specifically
provided
in
the
census
and
in
the
apportionment
act
for
a
mechanism,
and
it
is
a
historical
mechanism,
for
this
to
lie
in
congress
and
to
be
addressed
xx
a
particular
period
so
that
they
can
take
action.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
has
to
be,
as
the
statute
says,
a
subsequent
statute
that
has
to
be
enacted.
i
was
indicating
the
numerous
exceptions
to
the
usual
residence
rule.
six
censuses,
from
1870
to
1920,
seafarers,
not
matter
how
long
they
were
absent,
counted
at
the
land
home.
the
military
in
1900
counted
at
their
family
home
even
if
stationed
as
the
instruction
said,
at
home
or
abroad.
members
of
congress
are
counted
at
their
home
district,
even
though
they
live
and
sleep
most
of
the
time
in
the
district
of
columbia.
from
1910
to
1940,
the
instructions
said,
if
there
is
an
american
citizen
in
your
family
abroad,
he
should
be
counted
at
your
family
home,
and
it
said,
it
does
not
matter
how
long
the
absence
may
continue.
in
other
words,
the
usual
residence
concept
cannot
provide
law
to
apply
in
considering
this
case,
because
this
is
a
departure
and
modification
of
the
usual
residence
rule,
as
has
been
historically
done
in
a
variety
of
circumstances
including,
of
course,
most
prominently
in
1970
when
again,
federal
personnel
abroad
were
apportioned
among
the
states
based
on
home
of
record.
now
turning
to
the
merits,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
secretary's
decision
to
apportion
the
personnel
overseas
was
not
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
itself,
and
it
was
not.
the
record
indicates
the
reasons
for
the
secretary's
action.
these
personnel
are
away
from
home
temporarily
and
involuntarily
in
the
service
of
their
country.
they
still
consider
themselves
usual
residents
of
the
united
states,
although
they
are
overseas.
the
secretary
noted
the
bipartisan
congressional
support
for
apportioning
the
overseas
population,
and
in
turn,
that
support
noted
these
personnel
vote
in
the
united
states,
they
pay
taxes
in
the
united
states.
now,
the
secretary
did
note
in
his
decision
memorandum
that
the
defense
department
was
going
to
undertake
a
survey,
an
actual
survey
of
its
personnel
overseas,
but
contrary
to
the
view
of
massachusetts,
that
was
not
a
condition
of
his
decision.
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
joint
appendix
on
page
122,
it
spells
out
exactly
what
the
condition
is.
this
is
the
decision
memorandum
approved
by
the
secretary.
it
says:
i
recommend
that
you
count
them,
provided
that
there
is
timely
receipt
of
acceptable
data
from
the
defense
department.
now,
when
the
defense
department
cancelled
its
survey,
that
question
became
pertinent.
is
there
acceptable
data
that
can
be
provided?
and
the
secretary
determined
that
home
of
record,
supplemented
and
improved,
did
provide
acceptable
data.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
undercuts
our
position.
first
of
course,
representations
or
statements
of
counsel
are
not
part
of
the
administrative
record,
and
what
needs
to
be
reviewed
is
the
administrative
record.
but
secondly,
all
that
the
counsel
was
saying
is
that
the
secretary
had
made
a
commitment.
he
had
made
a
decision,
the
commitment
referred
to
is
simply
the
decision
in
the
administrative
record.
yes,
we
are
going
to
apportion
the
overseas
personnel
if,
if
there
is
acceptable
data.
so
the
commitment
that
the
counsel
in
the
trial
was
referring
to
is
no
different
than
that
in
the
decision
memorandum
in
the
record.
now,
is
home
of
record
acceptable
data?
the
secretary,
who
has
the
discretion
to
conduct
the
census
in
the
form
and
content
he
may
determine,
determined
that
it
was.
the
technical
staff
of
the
census
bureau
said
it
comes
closest
to
usual
residence.
it
is
the
last
place
that
a
serviceman
or
woman
chooses
to
reside.
the
congressional
research
service,
whose
study
was
in
the
record,
indicated
that
it
is
closest
to
a
serviceman's
own
concept
of
his
usual
residence,
an
important
point,
since
much
of
the
census
is
self-selecting.
now,
in
the
course
of
reaching
that
decision,
concerns
were
raised
about
the
data.
this
is
not
a
sanitized,
pre-cooked
administrative
record.
it
is
not
an
administrative
record
at
all
in
the
usual
sense
of
a
discrete
proceeding
leading
to
a
decision.
it
is
part
of
the
census
bureau's
business
over
the
past
years,
but
every
one
of
the
concerns
that
massachusetts
raises,
every
one
of
the
concerns
cited
by
the
district
court
was
addressed
and
answered
in
the
record.
let's
take
them:
first,
the
department
of
defense
testified
in
1989
that
none
of
its
data
met
a
reasonable
test
of
validity
for
apportionment
purposes.
answer:
joint
appendix,
page
161,
the
data
will
be
supplemented
and
improved
by
methodologies
devised
by
the
technical
experts
who
designed
the
overseas
enumeration.
second,
there
was
a
gap
in
home
of
record.
up
to
10
percent
of
servicemen
did
not
have
a
home
of
record.
answer:
joint
appendix,
page
158
and
162,
the
defense
manpower
data
center
would
use
its
automated
records
to
complete,
fill
in
the
gap,
to
the
extent
that
it
will
be
negligible.
it
went
from
7
percent
to
0.2
percent.
the
census
bureau
itself
said
that
the
data
was
of
unknown
reliability
because
it
could
be
used
to
choose
a
low
or
no
income
tax
state.
answer:
joint
appendix,
page
151,
it
is
legal
residence
that
determines
where
you
are
taxed,
not
home
of
record.
the
pentagon
opined
that
last
duty
station
would
be
closest
to
the
concept
of
home
of
record.
answer:
joint
appendix,
page
162,
the
census
bureau
disagreed.
it
noted,
for
example,
if
your
last
duty
station
was
the
pentagon,
you
would
show
up
as
living
in
d.c.,
and
you
may
have
lived
in
virginia
or
maryland.
and
finally,
the
point
that
we
hear
most
frequently,
the
census
bureau
itself
said
that
it
would
be,
quote,
arbitrary,
end
quote,
to
rely
on
the
defense
department
data
to
apportion
federal
personnel
overseas.
answer:
joint
appendix,
page
210,
that
same
study
relying
on
legal
opinions
in
1949
and
1969
noted
that
the
decision
whether
to
include
federal
personnel
overseas
was
discretionary.
so
they
were
obviously
not
using
arbitrary
in
an
apa
sense,
but
simply
in
the
general
sense
that
any
categorical
determination
is
arbitrary.
now
the
question
is
not...
massachusetts
may
not
agree
with
these
answers,
but
the
question
is
not
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong.
the
question
under
this
court's
precedence,
assuming
there
is
judicial
review,
is
whether
the
relevant
concerns
were
considered
and
if
the
secretary
committed
a
clear
error
of
judgment.
the
record
establishes
that
the
concerns
were
addressed,
were
considered,
and
it
seems
clear
that
there
was
not
a
clear
error
of
judgment
in
allocating
the
personnel
overseas
to
their
home
of
record.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
you
can
file
a
suit
for
habeas
corpus
against
the
prison
warden.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
be
reviewable
to
the
extent
it
is
the
warden's
action,
yes.
but
the
only
point
i
am
making
is
that
there
is
no
action
against
the
president
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
that
is
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
the
federal
court
of
appeals
held
recently,
and
as
i
said,
i
don't
understand
massachusetts
to
challenge
that.
and
since
there
is
no
review
of
the
president's
action
under
the
apa,
there
is
no
review
of
his
action
in
this
case,
and
since
his
action
is
indispensable
to
harm
to
massachusetts,
the
case
is
not
justiciable.
thank
you.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
reason
the
court
should
be
hesitant
to
conclude
that
judicial
review
is
available
is
the
consequences.
my
brother
says
it's
not
going
to
be
a
big
problem,
it's
always
just
going
to
be
between
number
435
and
number
436.
that's
not
true
at
all.
if
your
state
is
number
440
on
the
list
and
you
look,
and
you
see
if
the
undercount
litigation
comes
out
one
way,
you
move
up
to
438,
and
then
if
litigation
about
how
foreign
personnel
should
be
counted
moves
you
up
to
436,
and
then
you
need
to
look
very
carefully
at
how
many
boarding
schools
you
have
in
your
state
to
see
if
there
are
enough
of
those,
that's
a
departure
from
the
usual
residence
rule
to
bring
you
up
to
435.
you
have
to
file
that
lawsuit
even
though
another
state
the
same
day
is
going
to
file
a
lawsuit
against
the
secretary
for
not
counting
american
citizens
employed
by
private
companies
abroad,
and
that'll
lower
you
down
again,
and
all
of
this
litigation
is
going
to
be
going
on
while
the
states
are
redistricting,
while
candidates
are
considering
whether
to
run,
while
primaries
are
taking
place.
the
point
is
that
the
conduct
of
the
census
and
the
reapportionment
is
not
suited
to
a
case-by-case
judicial
review
of
each
one
of
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
judgment
calls
that
go
into
the
census.
that's
particularly
true
when
you
consider
that
it's
done
in
a
limited
time
and
on
a
limited
budget.
the
district
court
looked
at
one
decision...
how
to
allocate
federal
personnel
overseas...
and
concluded
that
an
actual
survey
would
have
led
to
more
accurate
data.
that
may
or
may
not
be
true.
the
record
is
unclear
on
that.
but
even
assuming
it's
true,
it
would
have
led
to
more
accurate
data
only
at
a
great
increase
in
cost.
the
secretary
determined
that
the
additional
accuracy,
if
any,
was
not
worth
the
cost.
there's
no
standard--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--absolutely
not.
i
think
the
court
should
conclude
that
the
decision
of
the
secretary
is
committed
to
his
discretion
by
law
and
therefore
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you
agree,
if
that
is
your
view,
you
should
still
reverse
because
this
matter
was
not
remanded
to
the
secretary.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
correct.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
could
remand
to
the
secretary,
yes,
of
course,
but
that
is
not
what
the
district
court
did,
and
if
you
disagree
with
us--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
we
wouldn't
consider
that
a
resounding
victory.
[laughter]
we
believe
that
the
matter
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
point
i
was
making
on
the
cost
is
there's
no
standard...
there
are
no
standards
for
a
judge
to
decide,
is
this
additional
accuracy
worth
the
cost,
particularly
since
the
additional
funds
that
would
be
devoted
would
be
taken
from
some
other
enumeration
task,
say
an
effort
to
increase
the
count
of
the
homeless
or
migrant
workers.
the
district
court's
in
no
position
to
decide
whether
the
increase
in
accuracy
of
the
overseas
count
is
more
important
than
the
decrease
in
the
accuracy
of
the
count
of
migrant
workers.
now,
massachusetts
has
no
trouble
treating
these
servicemen
and
women
overseas
as
its
own
when
it
comes
to
taxing
them,
and
they
don't
say
you
have
to
have
a
residence
here
before
we
can
tax
you,
and
it
does
allow
them
to
vote.
they
also
should
be
permitted
to
be
counted
for
purposes
of
the
census.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
say
in
every
instance
of
the
census.
we
miss
people.
we
miss
people
when
we
count
and
go
house
by
house.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
we
give
you
the
census
form
and
it
says
list
the
people
in
your
house,
i
mean,
just
as
on
the
answered
home
of
record,
maybe
people
lie.
they
say
well,
i've
got
four
children.
or
maybe
they
list
and
they've
got
four
children
including
one
who's
off
at
college,
even
though
the
rules
say
that
person
shouldn't
be
counted.
there
is
inaccuracy
inherent
in
a
census
of
250
million
people.
the
secretary
does
his
best...
her
best
to
eliminate
the
inaccuracy,
but
is
it
a
better
thing...
if
there
are,
let's
say
an
inaccuracy
of
4
percent
on
the
home
of
record
data,
is
it
better
to
exclude
it
so
you
don't
bring
in
that
4
percent
error
while
you're
excluding
96
percent
who
should
be
counted?
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
home
of
record
data
is
current
data.
it
is
the
judgment
about
the...
what
approximates
the
usual
residence
of
that
person
today.
it
may
have
been
entered
on
the
records
in
a
prior
year,
but
it
is
current
data.
thank
you,
your
honor.
