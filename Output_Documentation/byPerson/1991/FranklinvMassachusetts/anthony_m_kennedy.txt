justice
kennedy
--but
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
so,
but
what
do
you
think
the
agency
action
would
be
here?
justice
kennedy
and
in
your
view,
is
the
president
authorized
to
correct
that?
justice
kennedy
so
then
i
guess
the
next
possibility
is
the
president's
transmittal
of
the
data
to
congress
as
the
agency
act?
justice
kennedy
if
by
law
the
president's
action
were
final,
would
that
be
reviewable?
justice
kennedy
but
the
president
can't
seize
the
steel
mills
or
withhold
tapes
either,
but
his
actions
are
subject
to
review
in
those
instances.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
your
position,
he
is
not
subject
to
review
at
all.
justice
kennedy
but
my
hypothetical
was
that
his
action
was
conclusive.
