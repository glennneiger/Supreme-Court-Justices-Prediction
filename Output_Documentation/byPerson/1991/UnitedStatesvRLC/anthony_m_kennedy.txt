would
the
judge
determine
upward
departures...
the
possibility
of
upward
departures?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
just
asking
to
verify
your
position.
your
position
is
the
judge
would
take
into
account
any
upward
departures.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
some
reason
why
as
a
matter
of
policy
congress
would
not
have
wanted
the
juvenile
to
be
subjected
to
this
process
of
determining
whether
upward
departures
are
required,
because
that's
what...
for
instance,
in
this
case
there
was
a
stolen
automobile
which
was
not
included
in
the
manslaughter
offense.
i
think
that
may
be
a
reason
for
an
upward
departure.
is
there
some
policy
reason
why
the
congress
would
not
have
subjected
the
juvenile...
want...
would
not
have
wanted
the
juvenile
to
be
subjected
to
this
process?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
just
assume
that
that
would
be
a
ground
for
an
upward
departure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
the
district
judge
would
have
in
front
of
him
all
of
the
history
and
all
of
the
factors
that
would
be
taken
into
account
in
the
guidelines
anyway.
