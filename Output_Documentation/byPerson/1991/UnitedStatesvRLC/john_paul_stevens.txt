justice
john
paul
stevens
another
way
to
put
it
i
suppose,
mr.
larkin,
is
whether
the
sentencing
guidelines
authorize
a
term
of
imprisonment
any
higher...
or
whether
the
judge
is
authorized
to
impose
a
sentence
in
excess
of
that
permitted
by
the
sentencing
guidelines.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that
isn't
my
question.
is
a
sentence...
is
a
district...
say
you've
got
a
case
in
which
the
maximum
sentence
is
3
years,
but
the
maximum
sentence
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
would
be
2
years,
is
a
district
judge
authorized
to
impose
a
sentence
of
more
than
2
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
he
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand
the
statute
authorizes,
but
is
the
judge
authorized
to
impose
more
than
2
years
in
that
hypothesis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
it
not
be
reversible?
i'm
talking
about
an
adult,
not
a
juvenile.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
an
adult.
i'm
saying
in
the
case
of
an
adult,
would
the
judge
be
authorized
to
impose
a
sentence
of
more
than
2
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
the
question...
the
simple
question,
yes
or
no
question,
would
the
judge
be
authorized
to
impose
a
sentence
of
more
than
2
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
agree
it
would
be
reversible
error
were
the
judge
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
talking
about
an
adult
sentencing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
there
would
not
be
reversible
error
for
a
judge
to
impose
a
sentence
higher
than
authorized
by
the
sentencing
guidelines?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
argument,
but
why
wouldn't
it
be
reversible
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
assuming
a
situation
in
which
you
make
all
the
proper
analysis
and
you
either
conclude
there
is
no
aggravating
circumstance,
or
you
conclude
that,
even
with
the
aggravating
circumstance
included,
a
proper
application
of
the
sentencing
guidelines,
the
maximum
that
the...
judge...
the
sentence
the
judge
could
impose
would
be
2
years,
and
you're
telling
me
he
is
authorized
to
impose
a
higher
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
also
say
it
was
not
reversible
error
to
do
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying
he's
authorized
to
commit
reversible
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no,
no.
forget
all
the
procedures.
all
the
procedures
are
complied
with.
the
sentencing
is
accurately
computed,
as
the
maximum
under
the
guidelines
is
2
years,
and
i
thought
you
said
if
he
imposed
more
it
would
be
reversible
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
all
that.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
an
understanding
of
what...
but
you
would
agree
that
it
would
be
reversible
error
if
he
did
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
therefore
saying
he
is
authorized
to
commit
reversible
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
that's
all
i
wanted...
it
was
rather
obvious,
but
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
out
of
you.
you're
a
very
good
lawyer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they
do
limit
the
authority
of
the
judge
to
impose
sentences,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
also
impose
limits.
they
impose
limits
on
the
period
of
time
that
can
be
imposed,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
they
limit
the
scope...
or
don't
they
limit
the
scope
of
his
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
they
limit
it
to
2
years
instead
of
3.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
assuming
it
reads
as
though
it
were
written
"would
be
authorized
by
statute".
if
they'd
put
the
words
"by
statute"
in,
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
meaning.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
the
one
i've
drafted.
you
can't
make
it
any
clearer
than
i've
just
made
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
not
that
would
have
been
imposed.
then
the
judge
could
have
imposed
without
committing
reversible
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
which
is
quite
different
from
would
have
been
imposed,
because
it's
a
maximum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
didn't
that
all
change
with
the
sentencing
reform
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
guidelines
don't
apply,
but
the
basic
system
changed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
when
was
this
statute
adopted
that
we're
construing
today,
in
the
same
act,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
seems
rather
anomalous
to
say
they
wanted
uniformity
of
sentencing
across
the
board
with
one
exception,
that
juveniles
can
get
a
more
severe
sentence
than
adults.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
that's
easy.
then
you
look
at
the
statutory
maximum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
purpose
of
the
statute
here
is
to
say
we
don't
want
juveniles
to
get
a
longer
sentence
than
adults
get.
that's
what...
sort
of
the
simple
meaning
that
comes
through.
we
don't...
then
we
get
a...
have
a
maximum
sentence
that
would
be
higher
than
the
maximum
for
an
adult.
and
you're
saying
that's
not
true;
they
can
get
a
higher
one.
that's
the
message
i
get
out
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
really
advance
a
plausible
reason
for
congress
saying,
we
don't
care
if
juveniles
get
a
stiffer
sentence
than
adults.
i
don't...
it's
just
rather
counterintuitive
to
think
congress
would
have
wanted
that
particular
conclusion.
mr.
larkin,
under
the
1950
act,
couldn't
juveniles
get
a
longer
sentence
than
an
adult?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mention
there
are
only
170.
was
this
cases
in
a
1-year
period,
was
it,
that
you
get--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
within
that
170
the
maximum
would
have
been
fixed
by
the
age
of
the
juvenile
as
opposed
to
the
maximum
for
an
adult?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
suppose
this
is
a
fairly
rare
case,
the
one
we
have
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
don't
break
them
down.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think...
well,
go
ahead.
just
going
back
to
(a)
for
a
minute,
isn't
the
more
normal
reading
of
that
that
that
refers
to
sentencing
guidelines...
commission
policy
statements
that
were
contemplated
by
congress
but
that
have
never
actually
been
written?
isn't
that
a
possible
reading?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
thought
that
maybe
the
sentencing
commission
would
develop
policy
statements
for
juvenile
offenders
but
they've
never
gotten
around
to
doing
it.
i'm
not
sure
that
cuts
either
way
in
the
case,
but
isn't
that
a
possible
reading?
