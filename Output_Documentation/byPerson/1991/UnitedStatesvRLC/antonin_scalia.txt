justice
antonin
scalia
i
knew
we
were
in
trouble
when
they
said
or.
i
mean,
that's
ungrammatical
right
there,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
it's
poorly
drafted.
it
should
be
lesser
of
something
and
something,
not
lesser
of
something
or
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
the
authority
is
in
one
place
and
the
guidelines
are
just
a
limitation
upon
that
authority,
but
that's
not
your
argument.
you're
relying
upon
the
fact
that
it's
a
different
person,
not
the
congress
personally?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
had
a
statute
that
said
you
get
10
years
for
a
particular
crime
and
then
you
have
a
later
statute
that
says,
however,
if
the
crime
is
committed
on
a
sunday
10
years
will
not
be
imposed;
you
can
only
impose
5,
then
it
would
be
the
10-year
statute
that
authorizes
the
penalty
and
we
would
disregard
for
purposes
of
this
provision
the
5-year
statute,
because
that
just
limits
the
prior
authority.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
said
before.
you're
relying
on
the
difference
between
congress
and
the
commission,
not
on
the
difference
between
authorizing
and
limiting
an
authorization.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
larkin,
it
really
seems
to
me
you
can
use
authorize
either
the
way
you're
using
it
or
the
way
justice
stevens
is
using
it.
i
mean,
you
can
say
he's
not
authorized
to
impose
any
more
than
the
guidelines
permit.
that's
why
we
reversed
the
judge.
i
mean,
it's
permissible
to
use
it
both
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
make
believe
that
i
think
it's...
that
it
bears
both
meanings,
okay.
if
i
believe
that,
why
shouldn't
i
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
and
say,
you
know,
where
you
can
bear
either
meaning
you
take
the
more
lenient
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
larkin,
that
second
statute
that
you
refer
to
on
page
11
in
the
footnote,
i
agree
with
you
that
it
does
make
it
clear
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
the
guidelines
to
apply
to
juveniles,
but
that's
not
the
issue
here,
that
the
guidelines
will
apply
to
juveniles.
it's
a
quite
different
issue...
whether
the
maximum
of
the
guidelines
will
be
the
maximum
for
a
sentencing
of
a
juvenile,
and
that's
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx--
--specifically
it
no
longer
refers
to
the
statute.
just
a
minute,
justice
scalia,
i
think
i
started
before
you
did.
in
any
respects
that
were
relevant,
here...
the
modifications?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
it
now?
certainly.
you
don't
think
it
significant
that
it
used
to
specifically
refer
to
a
statute
and
it
now
does
not
refer
to
a
statute?
i
consider
that
a
significant
change.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
roe,
you
say
that
you're
not
arguing
to
have
the
guidelines
fully
applied
to
juveniles,
but
that's
cold
comfort
to
the
district
judge,
isn't
it?
isn't
it
the
case
that
if
we
find
in
your
favor
in
this
case
the
district
judge
is
going
to
have
to
go
through
the
same
steps
that
one
would
go
through
under
the
guidelines?
he's
going
to
have
to
compute
what
the
maximum
sentence
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
as
far
as
the
amount
of
work
that
the
district
judge
has
to
go
through--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
comes
to
the
same,
right?
he
has
to
go
through
the
same
steps
that
he
would
have
to
do
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
changed
under
the
guidelines?
i
mean,
the
guideline
does
not
leave
you,
does
it,
with
one
sentence?
doesn't
it
leave
a
little
range?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
after
you
apply
all
the
guidelines,
does
it
leave
you
at
least
a
couple
of
months
to
play
with?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
my
point
is
that
the
situation,
if
we
agree
with
you,
would
still
be
what
the
situation
was
before
this
legislation
was
passed.
that
is
to
say,
on
some
occasions
a
juvenile
may
get
a
harsher
sentence
than
an
adult
would
get--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
they'd
both
be
applying
the
guidelines
but
the
judge
in
the
juvenile
case
may
take
the
upper
limit
of
it
and
the
judge
in
the
adult
case
may
take
a
lower
limit
of
that
particular
guideline,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
roe,
i
have
one
puzzlement.
the
section
we're
talking
about
is
subsection
(c).
subsection
(a)
of
5037
says
that
the
sentencing
judge
in
these
juvenile
cases,
after
considering
any
pertinent
policy
statements
promulgated
by
the
sentencing
commission,
shall,
you
know,
impose
sentence,
take
the
action
and
so
forth.
why
would
it
say
that
if
he
has
to
apply
the
guidelines
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but,
why
wouldn't
the
guidelines
as
a
whole
be
relevant
to
determining
the
sentence?
only
the
policy
statements?
i
mean,
i
would
have
expected
(a)
to
refer
to
the
entire
guidelines.
it's
a
very
strange
reference.
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
chapman
was
a
sentencing
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
the
chief
justice
was
asking
for
the
closest
case
you
have
that
involved
the
application
of
the
rule
of
lenity
to
sentencing,
as
opposed
to
whether
an
act
is
a
crime.
i'd
appreciate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
in
your
brief?
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
