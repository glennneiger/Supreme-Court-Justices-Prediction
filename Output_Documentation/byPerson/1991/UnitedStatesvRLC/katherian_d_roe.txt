ms.
katherian
d.
roe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
r.
l.
c.
had
been
tried
and
sentenced
as
an
adult,
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
would
have
limited
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
was
authorized
for
r.
l.
c..
we
are
not
arguing,
nor
did
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
find,
that
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
directly
control
juvenile
sentencing.
we
are
not
arguing,
and
nor
did
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
find,
that
a
juvenile
must
receive
the
same
sentence
that
an
adult
receives.
but
what
we
are
arguing
is
the
language,
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
authorized,
has
to
be
the
same
as
an
adult,
and
it
also...
and
it
means
that
it
has
to
be
the
same
under
the
sentencing
guidelines.
the
reality
is
that
if
an
adult
had
been
sentenced
for
the
crime
of
involuntary
manslaughter
the
sentencing
court
would
have
had
no
choice
but
to
determine
what
the
applicable
sentencing
guidelines
would
be.
it
would
only
be
after
the
court
looked
to
the
guidelines...
at
that
point,
and
only
at
that
point,
could
the
court
determine
what
the
maximum
sentence
would
be,
and
that
is
exactly
what
you
have
to
do
for
an
adult,
because
the
plain
language
in
this
statute...
although
the
government
tries
to
read
it
in
a
different
manner,
the
plain
language
says
that
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
would
be
authorized
if
the
juvenile
had
been
tried
and
convicted
as
an
adult...
if
r.
l.
c.
had
been
tried
and
convicted
as
an
adult
in
this
case,
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
authorized
would
have
been
21
months.
he
was
sentenced
to
serve
36.
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
to
be
in
direct
violation
of
section
5037.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
yes,
that's
correct,
justice,
that
he
would
have
to
compute
what
the
maximum
sentence
would
be,
but
that's
different
than
applying
the
guidelines.
we're
not
arguing
that
the
guidelines
are
applicable.
what
we're
arguing
is
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
maximum
and
then
from
there
you
make
your
determination.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
your
honor--
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
--your
honor,
in
1990
there
were
approximately
47,000
cases
in
the
federal
courts;
170
of
those
cases
were
juvenile.
i
think
that's
less
than
approximately
one-third
of
1
percent,
and
for
this
to
be
applicable
what
the
court
would
have
to
do
is
they
would
have
to
determine
that
the
maximum
guidelines...
maximum
under
the
guidelines
would
be
more
than
the
statutory
maximum.
excuse
me,
actually--
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
--yes,
there
is
a
possibility
of
upward
departures,
but
i
think
in
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
and
as
well
as
the
way
we
argue
this,
your
honor,
that
is
no
different
than
if
it
had
been
an
adult.
you
still
make
the
same
determination.
if
there
are
egregious--
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
--yes,
your
honor.
if
there
were
egregious
circumstances
or
aggravating
circumstances
that
would
result
in
an
upward
departure,
then
that
would
be
the
same
as
if
it
had
been
an
adult.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
the
judge
was...
judge
maclaughlin,
your
honor.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
no,
your
honor.
we--
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
--yes,
we
believe
it
is
a
fairly
rare
case,
your
honor,
but
we
get
our
statistics
from
the
administrative
office
of
the
court--
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
--and
they
don't
break
those
down.
the
concept
that
a
juvenile
should
not
be
subject
to
a
harsher
penalty
than
an
adult
is
certainly
not
a
new
concept.
the
federal
juvenile
delinquency
act
was
enacted
in
1938,
and
ever
since
that
time
there
has
been
one
constant
in
the
area
of
federal
juvenile
sentencing,
and
that
constant
has
been
that
a
juvenile
will
not
be
subject
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
that
would
be
harsher
than
that
which
an
adult
would
receive.
juvenile
sentencing
has...
or
at
least
maximum
for
a
juvenile
sentencing...
has
always
been
linked
to
adult
sentencing.
the
thing
that
has
changed
is
how
we
determine
what
the
maximum
sentence
for
an
adult
would
be,
and
the
reason
it's
changed
is
with
the
adoption
of
the
sentencing
guidelines.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
would
have
been,
because
they
would
have
still
been
subject
to
the
same
maximum
term
of
imprisonment,
because
prior
to
the
sentencing
guidelines
you
determine
what
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
would
be
for
both
an
adult
and
a
juvenile
by
looking
at
the
statutory
maximum
for
the
offense.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
juvenile
couldn't
be
subjected
to
a
higher
maximum,
not
that
the
judge
couldn't
decide
in
his
discretion
that
the
juvenile
should
in
fact
receive
a
higher
sentence
than
that
which
he
might
have
given
an
adult.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
your
honor--
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
--for
an
adult,
it
does,
your
honor.
i
believe
it's
basically
a
25
percent
spread
between
the
bottom
and
the
top
of
the
guidelines.
for
an
adult
that
would
be
true,
but
we're
not
arguing
that
that...
range
would
be
applicable
to
a
juvenile.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
the
only
thing
that
applies
in
a
juvenile
case
is
the
maximum.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
i
think
that's
true,
but
they
would
both
be
subjected
to
the
same
maximum.
it's
just
that
the
judge
in
his
discretion,
or
her
discretion,
would
choose
perhaps
to
sentence
a
juvenile
to
a
higher
sentence
and
an
adult
to
a
lower
sentence.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
you
determine
the
maximum
by
essentially
making
a
determination
under
the
guidelines.
in
this
case,
the
determination
was
for
the
offense
of
involuntary
manslaughter,
and
for--
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
--if
he
had
been
tried
and
convicted
as
an
adult,
you
need
to
determine
what
the
maximum
would
have
been
for
that
adult,
and
then
that
will
be
the
maximum
that
you
apply
to
the
juvenile.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor,
it
could.
in
those
rare
circumstances
where
the
court
would
find
that
there
are
egregious
circumstances
or
aggravating
circumstances
that
would
be
cause
for
an
upward
departure,
it
certainly
could
reach
the
statutory
maximum.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
only,
your
honor,
if
the
person
had...
was
probably
a
very
significant
criminal
history,
then
the
possibility
exists
that
they
could
come
very
close
to
the
statutory
maximum,
if
not
reach
it.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
first...
i
believe
that's
a
two-part
question,
justice
kennedy.
the
first
part
i'll
answer
is
that
there
was
a
stolen
car
in
this
case.
there
was
never
any
determination
as
to
exactly
who
stole
the--
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
--all
right.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
then
your
question
i
believe
is,
is
there
any
reason
why
congress
would
not
want
to
subject
a
juvenile
to
this
proceeding?
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that
it's
more
likely
that
the
congress
would
not
want
to
subject
a
juvenile
to
a
harsher
penalty
than
an
adult
would
receive,
and
i
think
that
that's
been
consistent
with
their
policies
from
1938,
when
they
first
enacted
the
federal
juvenile
delinquency
act.
and
i
believe
that's
also
consistent
with
the
changes
that
they
made
when
they
drafted
the
comprehensive
crime
control
act
and
made
changes
to
the
federal
juvenile
delinquency
act
as
part
of
those...
as
part
of
that.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
that's
correct,
and
your
honor,
when
the
case
did
go
back
for
resentencing,
the
district
judge
did
not
find
any
aggravating
circumstances
or
any
grounds
for
departure.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
he
was
released
over
9
months
ago,
your
honor.
my
understanding
of
the
law,
sir,
is
that
if
he
would
lose,
the
court
would
have
it
within
its
power
to
reinstate
the
sentence
of
the
original
court
and
sentence
him
to...
and
send
him
back
for
an
additional
18
months
imprisonment,
or
official
detention,
if
you
will.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
well,
your
honor,
it's
hard
to
say,
but
certainly
when
he
went
back
on
remand
for
resentencing
judge
maclaughlin
recognized
that
there
were
circumstances,
and
that
the
circumstances
had
changed,
and
sentenced
r.
l.
c.
to
only
18
months.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
he's
not.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
your
honor,
i
think
that
subsection
(a)
essentially
addresses
a
different
interest.
what
subsection
(a)
addresses
is
that
they
want
the
court
to
look
towards
the
guidelines,
or
the
policy
statements,
to
determine
or
help
the
court
to
determine
what
the
sentence
should
be,
and
what
the
appropriate
sentence
should
be.
in
subsection
(c),
where
they
actually
talk
about
what
the
maximum
term
a
juvenile
can
receive
is,
i
think
at
that
point
then
the
judge
is
looking
at
something
different.
the
judge
is
determining
what
the
maximum
sentence
would
be.
so
he's
addressing
basically
two
different
concerns.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
it's
possible,
your
honor,
that
they
didn't
actually
address
the
guidelines
because
this
was
part
of
the
comprehensive
crime
control
act.
the
amendments
were
part
of
the
act,
and
they
may
have
believed...
they
may
have
incorrectly
believed
that
everyone
would
understand
what
they
were
referring
to,
because
clearly
after
the
comprehensive
crime
control
act
was
passed
and
the
guidelines
became
effective,
the
sentencing
guidelines
determined
and
limited
the
sentence
that
an
adult
would
receive,
and
the
language
i
believe
in
the
statute
is
very
clear.
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
would
be
authorized
if
the
juvenile
had
been
tried
and
convicted
as
an
adult.
no
question,
if
the
juvenile
had
been
tried
and
convicted
as
an
adult
the
sentencing
guidelines
would
limit
the
sentence
that
a
court
could
impose,
and
if
the
court
imposed
a
sentence
in
excess
of
the
sentence
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
authorized,
then
it
would
be
reversible
error
under
u.s.c.
3742.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
i
think
that--
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
--it's
a
possible
reading,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
ascribe
to
that
reading.
i
think
that
what
they're
talking
about
is
that
they
wanted
the
court
to
look
at
the...
excuse
me,
to
look
at
the
policy
statements
and
determine
what
the
reasons
might
be
for
sentencing
a
certain
person
to
a
certain
amount
of
time,
not
necessarily
what
the
maximum
was,
because
that
would
come
later
in
subsection
(c),
but
in
(a)
just
to
look
at
the
policy
statements
to
determine
what
congress'
thoughts
were
and
what
the
sentencing
commission's
thoughts
were
when
they
enacted
these
guidelines.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
i
think
that's
also
a
possible
interpretation,
justice
souter.
i
haven't
seen
anything
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
any
other
documentation
that
indicates
exactly
what
their
intent
was,
but
i
think
that
all
those
are
possible
interpretations.
the
government
argues
that
sentencing
guidelines...
essentially
the
sentencing
guidelines
cannot
authorize
a
sentence,
and
i
think
that...
or
it
appears,
based
on
the
court's
decision
in
mistretta,
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
do
authorize
a
sentence,
because
this
court
recognized
in
mistretta
that
there
was
a
delegation
of
authority
to
the
sentencing
commission,
a
broad
delegation
of
authority,
and
that
the
authority
that
was
delegated
was
the
authority
to
formulate
binding
sentencing
guidelines,
and
that
there
would
be
determinate
ranges,
that
the
guidelines
would
be
mandatory...
a
judge
would
have
no
choice
but
to
impose
them...
and
that
if
the
judge
did
not
impose
them
there
was
a
provision
written
right
into
the
act
that
it
would
be
reversible
error.
so
clearly
the
practical
and
legal
effects
of
the
guidelines
are
that
they
create
an
enforceable
provision
and
they
set
limits
that
are
below
the
statutory
limits,
and
i
believe
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
word
authorized
and
the
fact
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
are
not
authorized
fails
to
take
that
into
account.
our
position
is
and
has
been
since
the
beginning
that
this
statute
is
not
ambiguous.
clearly,
they
could
have
said
what
the
government
reads
the
statute
to
have
said,
but
it
doesn't
say
that,
and
maybe
one
of
the
most
important
things
is
that
at
one
time
it
did
make
a
reference
to
statutory
maximum,
and
that
reference
was
deleted
by
congress.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
know
that
that
reference
was
deleted
before
this
statute
ever
became
effective.
so
the
statute,
whereas
it
may
have
once
referred
to
the
statutory
maximum,
it
never
referred
to
the
statutory
maximum
when
it
became
effective.
at
the
time
it
became
effective,
that
language
was
gone.
we
do
not
believe
this
is
an
ambiguous
statute,
but
if
the
court
determines
that
it
is
an
ambiguous
statute,
i
think
that
the
court
must
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
as
did
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
because
in
this
case
to
not
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
would
place
the
respondent
in
a
position
where
essentially
he
would
be
punished
because
this
court
has
to
guess...
albeit
an
educated
guess,
but
would
have
to
guess
as
to
what
congress
intended.
and
the
rule
of
lenity
has
long
established
that
if
the
court
has
to
guess,
then
it
should
guess
in
favor
of
the
person,
the
individual,
and
it
should
guess
in
favor
of
the
shorter
sentence.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
well,
let
me
rephrase
that.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
[laughter]
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
i
think
this
case,
your
honor,
is
not
that
inconsiscent
with
the
chapman
case,
because
in
the
chapman
case
where
the
court
did
not
apply
the
rule
of
lenity,
the
court
said
that
when
congress
wants
to
say
something,
they
know
how
to
say
it,
and
if
they
don't
say
it,
then
we
can
assume
that
they
didn't
mean
it.
and
i
think
that
that's
analogous
with
our
case,
because
congress
clearly
knew
how
to
say
it
if
they
meant
statutory
maximum,
and
as
i
indicated
earlier
they
did
say
it
at
one
point,
but
they
deleted
it.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
your
discussion
in
the
chapman
opinion,
your
honor,
is
very
brief.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
yes,
your
honor,
you
did.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
yes,
your
honor,
you
did.
in
that
case,
your
honor,
you
held
that
the
case
was
not...
or,
the
statute
was
not
ambiguous,
and
i
don't
believe
the
statute
is
ambiguous
in
this
case,
but
if
the
court
does
believe
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
i
think
you
must
find
in
the
favor
of
the
shorter
construction,
the
one
that's
been
urged
by
the...
or,
the
one
that
was
applied
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
one
that's
urged
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
no,
your
honor,
chapman

no,
your
honor,
chapman
was
not
a
sentencing
case.
ms.
katherian

i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
the
question.
i
think
the
closest
case
i
would
be
able
to
cite
for
that
is
u.s.
v.
bifulco,
and
that
was
in
fact
a
sentencing
case,
your
honor,
and
in
that
case
the
court
said
you
can't
increase
the
penalty...
it
was
a
united
states
supreme
court
case,
where
it
said
you
can't
increase
the
penalty
for
an
individual
if
all
you
can
do
is
guess
as
to
what
congress
intended.
so
yes,
you
have
applied
it
to
sentencing.
ms.
katherian
d.
roe
your
honor,
that
is
cited
in
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision,
which
is
in
the
record.
thank
you.
