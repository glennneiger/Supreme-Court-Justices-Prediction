and
i
suppose
that
while
the
judge
is
free
to
escalate
the
term
beyond
the
norm
if
there's
an
aggravating
circumstance,
he
can't
go
above
the
maximum
term
set
by
statute.
justice

the
youth
corrections
act.
wasn't
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--wasn't
that
repealed
in
1984?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
don't...
you
can't
really
say
that
congress
didn't
address
the
juvenile
sentencing
system
when
they
repealed
that
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
nevertheless
it
did
repeal
a...
an
act
that
had
to
do
with
juvenile
sentencing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right.
this
statute
we're
now
talking
about
was
in
place
before
1984.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
everybody
would
agree
that
then
to
apply
the
act
you
would
look
to
the
maximum
term
authorized
by
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
the
suggestion
is
on
the
other
side
that
the
meaning
of
that
statute
has
changed.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
it's
the
same
words.
the
statute
reads
exactly
like
it
did
before
1984.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
did
reenact
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
find
the
maximum?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
really
say
that
whatever
the
maximum
might
have
been
in
a
case
like
this,
what
would
have
a
judge...
what
would
a
judge...
what
would
have
a
judge
been
able
to
sentence
this
particular
person
for
if
he
had
been
an
adult.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
maximum
could
have
been...
could
it
ever
reach
the
maximum
authorized
by
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
absent
aggravating
circumstances,
it
could
never
go
up.
