justice
david
h.
souter
i
was
going
to
suggest
something
else,
and
that
was
to
focus
on
the
word
"pertinent".
doing
that,
you
would
say
well,
the
sentence
in
(a)
in
effect
was
saying
look,
we're
not
importing
every
possible
policy
statement
that
might
be
applicable
in
adult
circumstances,
but
you
should
at
least
winnow
through
them
and
winnow
out
the
ones
that
would
be
pertinent
to
a
juvenile
proceeding
and
consider
them.
so
that
that
would
be
consistent
both
with
the
theory
that
they
were
not
subjecting
juvenile
sentencing
to
the
guidelines
across
the
board,
or
indeed
to
the
guideline
philosophy
across
the
board,
but
they
were
doing
so
if
the
sentencing
court
could
figure
out
on
a
selective
basis
what
might
be
applicable
in
a
juvenile
case
and
tell
them
to
consider
that,
and
of
course
ultimately,
on
your
theory,
be
subject
to
the
cap
of
the
highest
possible
adult
sentence.
does
that
make
sense?

the
second
case
is
united
states
and
r.l.c.,
no.
90-1577.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
respondent,
r.l.c.
is
a
member
of
the
red
lake
band
of
chippewa
indians.
at
the
age
of
16,
he
caused
the
death
of
a
two-year-old
child
on
an
indian
reservation.
because
that
act,
if
committed
by
an
adult,
would
have
been
the
crime
of
involuntary
manslaughter
on
an
indian
reservation,
the
district
court
found
r.l.c.
to
have
committed
an
act
of
juvenile
delinquency
within
the
meaning
of
the
applicable
statute.
the
provisions
of
the
juvenile
delinquency
act
limit
the
length
of
detention
that
may
be
ordered
in
r.l.c.'s
circumstances
to
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
could
be
authorized
if
the
juvenile
had
been
tried
and
convicted
as
an
adult.
the
maximum
sentence
for
involuntary
manslaughter
is
three
years
imprisonment
and
that
is
the
period
to
which
the
district
court
sentenced
r.l.c.
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
this
to
be
error
holding
that
the
maximum
length
of
official
detention
under
the
act
could
not
exceed
the
sentence
a
court
could
impose
on
a
similarly
situated
adult
after
application
of
the
united
states
sentencing
guidelines.
after
finding
that
the
relevant
guideline
range
would
yield
a
maximum
of
21
months,
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
r.l.c.'s
sentence
and
remanded
for
sentencing.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
between
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuits
on
whether
the
phrase,
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
would
be
authorized
if
the
juvenile
had
been
tried
and
convicted
as
an
adult,
refers
to
the
maximum
sentence
authorized
by
the
statute
creating
the
offense
or
the
maximum
that
could
be
imposed
after
application
of
the
guidelines.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
the
limitation
refers
to
the
maximum
sentence
that
could
be
imposed
after
application
of
the
guidelines.
our
holding
does
not
require
a
plenary
application
of
the
guidelines
to
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings
for
where
the
statutory
provision
applies,
the
sentencing
court's
concern
with
the
guidelines
goes
solely
to
the
upper
limit
of
the
guidelines'
range
in
setting
the
maximum
term
for
which
a
juvenile
may
be
committed
in
the
absence
of
circumstances
that
would
warrant
departure
from
the
guidelines
under
the
statute
governing
their
application.
we
find
the
language
of
the
statute
ambiguous
while
the
word
"authorize"
maybe
read
to
refer
to
the
maximum
sentence
provided
for
by
the
statute
defining
the
offense.
we
think
it
is
arguably
more
natural
reading
refers
to
the
maximum
sentence
that
could
be
imposed
after
application
of
all
statutes
with
the
required
bearing
on
the
sentencing
decision
including
a
statute
requiring
application
of
the
guidelines.
in
a
portion
of
the
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
white
and
stevens
joined,
i
conclude
that
legislative
history
supports
this
conclusion
and
results
in
the
ambiguity
about
the
statute's
intended
scope.
if
any
ambiguity
survived,
i
would
rest
upon
the
rule
of
lenity
to
choose
the
construction
yielding
the
shorter
sentence,
but
because
no
ambiguity
does
survive,
i
conclude
that
resort
to
the
rule
of
lenity
is
unnecessary.
