we'll
hear
argument
now
in
90-1577,
united
states
v.
r.
l.
c..
mr.
larkin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
larkin,
why
do
we
have
two
separate
things,
a
statutory
maximum
and
sentencing
guidelines?
were
they...
was
the
statutory
maximum
enacted
before
the
sentencing
guidelines
came
into
effect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
that
enacted
by
congress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
larkin.
ms.
roe,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
the
sentencing
guidelines
were
adopted,
ms.
roe,
would
it
have
been
impossible
for
a
district
judge
considering
a
juvenile's
case
to
sentence
the
juvenile
to
some
sort
of
confinement
if
faced
with
the
argument
well,
you
would
have
paroled...
you
would
have
given
an
adult
probation
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
although
the
rule
you
speak
for
is
that...
and
a
juvenile
could
never
have
received
a
higher
maximum
sentence
than
an
adult,
you're
not
saying
that
a
juvenile
could
never
have
received
a
harsher
sentence
than
a
similarly
situated
adult.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
we
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
to
authorize
sentences
as
well
as
to
these
substantive
elements
of
crimes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
a
rephrasing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
we
speak
of
the
rule
of
lenity
in
so
many
words
in
the
chapman
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
you
can
answer
that
question
fairly
specifically
if
you
remember
the
chapman
opinion,
which
i
don't.
did
we
speak
of
the
rule
of
lenity
in
so
many
words
in
that
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
did,
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
roe.
mr.
larkin,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
