harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
really
is
your
very
simple
issue
in
the
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
ms.
roe,
who
was
the
district
judge
in
minnesota?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
ms.
roe,
the
defendant
here
has
served
the
shorter
sentence,
hasn't
he?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
if
you
lose
here,
what
happens?
he
has
to
go
back
to
jail?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what's
your
guess
as
to
what
judge
maclaughlin
might
do?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
he's
not
the
hardest
nose
of
the
minnesota
federal
judges
by
any
means.
