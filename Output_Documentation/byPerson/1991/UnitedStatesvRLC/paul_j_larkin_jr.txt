mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
federal
juvenile
delinquency
act
in
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984.
at
issue
is
the
meaning
of
the
commitment
provision
under
the
federal
juvenile
delinquency
act.
that
statute
provides
in
part
as
follows,
and
is
reprinted
at
page
2
of
our
opening
brief:
"the
term
for
which
official
detention
may
be
ordered
for
a
juvenile
found
to
be
a
juvenile
delinquent
may
not
extend,
in
the
case
of
a
juvenile
who
is
less
than
eighteen
years
old,
beyond
the
lesser
of
the
date
when
the
juvenile
becomes
twenty-one
years
old;
or.
"
--and
here
is
the
pivotal
part
of
the
statute...
"the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
would
be
authorized
if
the
juvenile
had
been
tried
and
convicted
as
an
adult.
"
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--if
they
poorly
drafted
it
by
putting
in
the
or,
they
at
least
drafted
what
comes
after
the
or
with
sufficient
clarity,
we
believe,
to
make
clear
that
the
eighth
circuit
misread
it
in
this
case.
the
question
here
is
whether
that
part...
the
last
part
of
the
statute
that
i
just
read,
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
would
be
authorized
if
the
juvenile
had
been
tried
and
convicted
as
an
adult...
is
the
statutory
maximum
term
authorized
by
congress
or
is
the
maximum
sentence
that
can
be
imposed
under
the
sentencing
guidelines.
put
another
way,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
sentencing
guidelines
fix
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment,
even
though
the
sentencing
guidelines
themselves
do
not
apply
to
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
judge
is
always
authorized
to
impose
a
sentence
if
the
statute
allows
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
to
be
imposed,
but
5037,
in
our
view,
does
not
in
any
way
incorporate
the
sentencing
guidelines.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
clearly
think
the
statute--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
statute
authorizes--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
because
the
statute
is
what
governs
in
this
case,
not
the
sentencing
guidelines
at
all.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
my...
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
juveniles.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
that
is
still
true,
but
the
reason
is...
is
a
little
different.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
the
answer
is
yes.
the
reason
is,
the
guidelines
do
not
provide
authority
to
impose
a
sentence.
we
think
that's
an
important
distinction
between
the
way
we
look
at
the
statute
and
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
i
would
not,
because
the
statute,
if
you...
the
statute
dealing
with
adult
sentencing--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--right.
the
statute
dealing
with
adult--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
i
would
say
two
things
in
response
to
what
you
just
said.
first,
it
would
not
necessarily
be
reversible
error,
and
secondly,
the
guidelines
do
not
authorize
the
sentence
to
be
imposed.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
because
if
you
look
to
18
u.s.c.
section
3553,
subsection
(b),
it
says
that
a
district
court
should
impose
a
sentence
within
the
guidelines
range
that
the
commission
has
set
out,
unless
the
commission...
excuse
me,
the
district
court
were
to
find
an
aggravating
or
mitigating
factor--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
would
say
yes,
because
the
term
authorized
here
is
one
we
use--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
if...
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
an
error
to
impose
that
sentence
in
this
case,
but
it
would
still
be
a
sentence
that
would
be
authorized.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
a
judge
who
imposes
a
sentence,
for
example,
without
first
giving
the
defendant
the
opportunity
to
engage
in--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it
would
be
an
error,
but
it
would
not...
but
it's,
we
think,
an
incorrect
use
of
the
term,
authorized.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way,
your
honor,
i
will
be
glad
to
go
along
with
you.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
let
me
continue
just...
and
briefly
summarize
the
facts
and
procedural
posture,
because
both
are
very
simple.
shortly
after
midnight
on
the
evening
of
november
5,
1989,
letesha
mountain
was
killed
when
the
automobile
in
which
she
was
driving
was
hit
from
the
rear
by
a
stolen
automobile,
driven
by
respondent.
the
district
court,
after
a
hearing
at
which
respondent
was
represented
by
counsel,
concluded
that
his
conduct
amounted
to
involuntary
manslaughter
and
that
respondent
was
a
juvenile
delinquent.
there
followed
a
commitment
hearing
at
which
the
district
court
considered
a
variety
of
matters
such
as
respondent's
drinking
problem,
the
possibility
of
his
rehabilitation,
and
the
juvenile
facilities
available
for
detention.
after
that
hearing,
the
district
court
sentenced
respondent
to
36
months'
confinement.
on
appeal,
the
eighth
circuit
vacated
the
sentence
and
remanded
it
for
resentencing.
the
court
acknowledged
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
did
not
apply
to
juvenile
delinquency
adjudications.
the
court
nonetheless
ruled
that
using
the
sentencing
guidelines
to
define
the
maximum
sentence
that
could
be
imposed
on
the
juvenile
under
section
5037
would
eliminate
any
unwarranted
disparities
that
could
arise
between
the
sentencing
of
juveniles
and
adults
in
the
federal
courts
today.
the
eighth
circuit
believes
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
comprehensive
crime
control
act
of
1984
made
clear
that
congress
didn't
intend
for
such
disparities
to
exist.
finally,
the
eighth
circuit
also
relied
on
the
rule
of
lenity.
now,
we
believe
that
the
eighth
circuit
misread
the
statute.
in
our
view,
the
pivotal
part
of
the
statute,
the
phrase
dealing
with
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
would
be
authorized
if
the
juvenile
were
tried
and
convicted
as
an
adult,
refers
to
the
statutory
maximum
term
and
not
to
the
maximum
sentence
that
would
have
been
imposed
under
the
sentencing
guidelines.
and
we
think
part
of
the
reason--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
statutory...
yes,
your
honor,
the
statutory
maximum
for
involuntary
manslaughter
is
3
years.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
precise
year,
but
i
know
it
was
before
november
1
of
1987,
which
is
the
date
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
went
into
effect.
my
guess
is
the
statutory
maximum,
your
honor,
would
have
been
enacted
a
very
long
time
ago
because
it's
part
of
the
series
of
laws
dealing
with
homicide,
which
probably
extend
back
into
the
19th
century
at
some
point.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
is,
your
honor.
we
think
it's
a
simple
and
straightforward
issue.
we
think
that
it
is
erroneous
to
look
at
the
statute
in
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
did.
the
eighth
circuit
assumed
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
authorized
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
could
be
imposed,
but
the
sentencing
guidelines
do
not
authorize
punishment
to
be
imposed
at
all.
perhaps
the
most
elementary
principle
of
federal
criminal
law,
one
stated
in
this
court's
very
first
federal
criminal
law
case,
the
case
of
united
states
v.
hudson
and
goodwin,
is
that
only
an
act
of
congress
can
authorize
imprisonment
as
the
punishment
for
crime.
the
sentencing
reform
act
carries
through
that
principle.
when
congress
adopted
the
sentencing
reform
act--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
my
point...
i
think
i
haven't
changed
it...
is
that
it
is
an
act
of
congress
that
can
authorize
imprisonment,
and
when
congress
used
that
term
in
conjunction
with,
for
example,
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment,
what
the
statute
is
most
naturally
read
to
refer
to
is
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
authorized
by
a
statute,
since
it's
only
a
statute
that
can
authorize
imprisonment.
the
guidelines
do
not
authorize
imprisonment
in
that
respect.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they
establish
procedures
that
the
judges
must
go
through--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--in
that
sense
they
limit
the
judge's
proper
exercise
of
the
authority
that
is
given
him
by
the
statute,
but
it
is
still--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--they
can
limit
the
scope
of
his
authority
in
the
way
that
we
discussed
earlier.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
it
is
still,
we
think,
incorrect
to
look
at
having...
that
the
district
court
is
vested
with
that
authority
by
virtue
of
the
guidelines.
it
works
in
the
other
direction.
the
statutes
gave
the
district
court
that
authority
long
before
the
guidelines
came
into
existence,
and
the
guidelines
are
simply
designed
to
regularize
the
process
of
exercising
that
authority.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
in
both
case,
your
honor,
the
common
denominator
was
they
were
both
statutes,
and
congress,
if
it
wants
to,
can
say,
i'm
authorizing
you
to
sentence
a
defendant
on
monday
through
saturday
to
10
years,
and
in
a
second
statute,
i'm
authorizing
you
to
sentence
a
defendant
on
sunday
to
5
years.
they're
both
statutes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
latter,
your
honor,
i
think
is
reflected
in
the
former.
when
congress
created
the
commission
it
didn't
authorize
the
commission
to
set
maximum
terms
of
imprisonment.
what
the
congress
did
was
give
the
commission
the
authority,
if
you
will,
to
define
presumptive
ranges
of
sentencing.
that's
reflected
in
section
3553
of
title
18.
the
sentencing
commission
does
not
have
the
authority
to
deal
with
the
maximum
or
minimum
sentences
that
congress
has
posed--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
made
that
point
in
the
mistretta
case
in
a
passage
that
we
have
quoted
on
page
13
of
our
opening
brief.
the
court
there
made
clear,
as
the
statutes
themselves
made
clear,
that
every
sentence
the
sentencing
commission
designates
as
a
sentencing
range
must
be
within
the
range
of
sentences
that
congress
has
authorized
in
the
statutes
that
form
title
18
and
the
other
parts
of
the
united
states
code.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
it
is
not--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--because
that's
not
the
most
natural
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
meaning
we've
put
forward
is
the
one
this
court
has
used
in
its
own
cases,
as
we've
mentioned
in
our
brief.
while
it
may
be
true
that
the
term
"authorized",
if
you
will,
has
within
it
a
broad
range
of
meanings,
the
one
we're
putting
forward
is
the
most
natural
one,
and
it's
the
most...
particularly
the
most
natural
one
when
you
look
at
the
clause
as
a
whole.
it
refers
to
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
would
be
authorized.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
there
is
always
a
possibility
of
making
any
statute
clearer.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
one...
their
version
of
the
statute
should
read
as
follows:
the
district
court
should
not
impose
a
sentence
greater
than
the
same
sentence
that
would
have
been
imposed
on
an
adult,
if
he
had
been
tried
and
convicted
as
an
adult.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
or
that
could
have
imposed
without
committing
reversible
error,
if
you
will.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
and
that
we
think
strengthens
our
interpretation
a
little
bit,
because
what
you're
referring
to
is
the
possibility,
the
range...
the
sentence
that
congress
had
set
forward
that
existed
prior
to
november
1
of
1987
and
prior
to
1984
when
the
sentencing
reform
act
was
adopted.
what
you
have
here
in
essence
is
this:
for
almost
100
years
there
have
been
two
types
of
criminal
justice
systems.
there's
been
a
juvenile
justice
system
that's
reflected
here
in
the
sections
beginning
with
50--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
it
didn't,
your
honor.
in
three
ways
congress
made
clear
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
do
not
apply.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
no,
your
honor.
it
changed
with
the
limitation
that
it
changed
for
adults.
that's
what
congress
did.
in
fact--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it
was
readopted
in
that,
but
when
it
was
readopted
it
wasn't
readopted
with
the
purpose
of
making
the
same
sentencing
system
as
applicable
to
adults
applicable
to
children.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
respondents
made
that
argument.
we
think
they're
assuming
the
conclusion.
they're
assuming
that
congress
wanted
uniformity
across
the
board
to
include
juveniles,
and
it's
our
view
that
congress
did
not.
congress,
for
example,
in
section
995,
subsection
(a)(19)
of
title
28,
which
deals
with
the
powers
of
the
sentencing
commission,
said
that
the
sentencing
commission
has
the
power
by
a
majority
vote
to...
to
study
the
feasibility
of
developing
a
guideline
sentencing
system
for
juveniles.
that
is
not
simply
one
indication
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
don't
apply
to
juveniles.
it
also
represents
the
fact
that
congress
was
asking
the
sentencing
commission
for
guidance
in
this
regard.
after
all,
you
had
a
discretionary
sentencing
system
before
for
juveniles
and
for
adults,
and
congress
saw
that
there
were
terrible
problems
that
had
arisen
in
the
adult
criminal
justice
system.
it
decided
that
a
sentencing
guidelines
mechanism
was
the
way
of
reducing
those
disparities,
and
it
directed
the
commission
to
adopt
a
sentencing
guidelines
system
to
eliminate
those
disparities.
but
this
section
i've
just
cited
to
you,
which
is
excerpted
in
footnote
1
in
our
opening
brief
at
pages
10
to
11,
is
strong
proof
that
congress
didn't
believe
that
it
needed
at
that
time
to
address
the
problems
of
the
juvenile
justice
system.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
congress
is...
indicated
that
juvenile
justice
system
sentencing
mechanisms
with
only
one
minor
modification
should
remain
as
they
were.
the
minor
modification
is
a
second
reason
why
the
guidelines
don't
apply.
if
you
look
to
section
1537(a)
of
title
18,
one
of
the
sections...
subsections
immediately
preceding
the
one
i
quoted,
you'll
see
that
congress
said
that
at
juvenile
commitment
proceedings
a
district
court
should
consider
any
pertinent
policy
statements
that
the
sentencing
commission
has
adopted,
and
to
date
the
commission
hasn't
adopted
any.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
it's
not
quite
different,
your
honor.
at
most,
it's
only
slightly
different,
for
two
reasons.
first,
as
i've
tried
to
summarize,
what
it
does
indicate
is
that
congress
left
alone
the
juvenile
sentencing
mechanisms
so
that
it
could
address
that
at
a
future
date
if
congress
desired
to,
perhaps
after
the
sentencing
commission
has
come
forward
with
a
study
showing
that
it
is...
is
or
is
not
feasible
to
have
a
guideline
sentencing
system
just
for
juveniles.
after
all,
there
are
caps
that
apply
to
the
juvenile
sentences
that
can
be
imposed
that
don't
apply
in
the
case
of
adults,
so
you
have
at
least
half
of
the
possible
sentences
that
could
be
imposed
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
or
more
than
half,
that
don't
apply
in
the
case
of
a
juvenile.
if
you
look
at
the
sentencing
table
that
is
in
the
guidelines--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--right,
but
the
point
is,
if
you're
setting
up
a
guideline
system
and
you
say
we're
not
going
to
apply
this
system,
this
new
system
to
the
juvenile
justice
system
because
we
want
somebody
to
study
it,
that
indicates
you're
looking
at
the
juvenile
justice
system
as
something
that
you
may
address
later,
and
that's
what
they
decided
here.
it's
not
necessary,
or
any
logical
implication
from
that,
that
it
means
we
want
the
statutory
maximum
sentence
from
the
guidelines
automatically
to
be
applied.
i
mean,
after
all,
the
purpose
of
a
guidelines
is
to
have
not
simply
a
maximum
but
a
minimum,
and
it
would
be
odd
for
congress,
knowing
that
the
commission--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
we
would
disagree,
that
what
congress
did
was
say
that
the
maximum
authorized
sentence
shouldn't
be
any
greater,
but
by
leaving
the
juvenile
justice
system
alone--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
19th...
i'm
not
sure
which
act
you're
referring
to,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
oh,
the
youth
corrections
act.
yes,
a
juvenile
could
get
a
longer
sentence
than
an
adult
under
the
youth
corrections
act.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
it
was.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
but
that
act
dealt
with
different
age
groups
than
what
you
have
here
under
the--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--not
juveniles,
young
adult
offender
sentencing.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
what
they
have
said
that
congress
now
has
required
that
the
courts
look
to
the
guidelines
to
fix...
to
figure
out
what--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no.
they
modified
it
in
some
respects.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they
reenacted
with
some
modifications
in
language.
the--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--not
on
this
point,
as
we
stand
today.
if
you
look
to
the
statute
as
it
was
adopted
in
1984,
you
will
see
that
it
included
three
additional
words
that
aren't
there
today.
it
referred
to
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
would
be
authorized
by
section
3581.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
was
put
in
there
because
section
3581
is
the
new
section
that
says
imprisonment
can
be
authorized
for
adult
offenders.
now,
that
three-word
phrase
came
out
later
to
eliminate
an
anomaly
that
could
have
arisen
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
that
specific
statute
was
mentioned
in
the
1984
act,
but
as
we've
explained
in
our
brief,
congress
took
that
three-word
phrase
out
in
order
to
make
sure
that
juveniles
would
not
receive
a
longer
maximum
sentence
to
which
they
would
be
exposed
rather
than
just
to
cap
the
sentence
that
a
juvenile
could
receive
as
being
the
sentence
that
would
be
imposed
under
the
sentencing
guidelines.
we
think
that
the
statute
as
a
whole,
as
well
as
the
different
policies
that
congress
could
have
had
in
mind,
which
was
we
think
addressing
this
at
a
later
date
after
it
had
gotten
the
advice
of
the
sentencing
commission,
indicate
that
it
is
the
statutory
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
is
what
was
being
referred
to
here.
now,
the
sentencing--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
didn't
say
it
wasn't
significant,
but
it's
not
dispositive,
and
it's
certainly
not
dispositive
in
respondent's
direction,
because
if
you
look
at
the
reason
why
they
took
that
out,
and
if
you
look
at
what
is
left,
we
think
it
still
as
a
whole
refers
to
the
maximum
punishment
authorized
by
statute
because
it
is
only
congress
that
can
authorize
a
maximum
punishment,
and
so
we
think
that
is
the
most
natural
reading
of
that
entire
phrase.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
not
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
