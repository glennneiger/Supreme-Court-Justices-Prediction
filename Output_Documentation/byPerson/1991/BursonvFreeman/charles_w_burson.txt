mr.
charles
w.
burson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
facial
challenge
to
a
tennessee
law
which
prohibits
on
election
day
campaigning
within
100
feet
to
the
entrance
of
the
polling
place.
to
put
this
distance
into
perspective,
this
courtroom
is
almost
100
wide.
now,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
suggested
that
25
feet
might
meet
constitutional
muster.
as
measured
from
where
i
stand,
25
feet
goes
to
the
second
row
of
the
press
section.
it's
the
state's
position
that
the
decision
of
the
tennessee
supreme
court
should
be
reversed
and
that
the
purposes
served
by
this
statute
are
of
the
highest
import,
and
the
limitation
imposed
on
protected
speech
is
minimal.
each
state
should
be
permitted
to
fashion
its
election
zone
boundary
in
a
manner
tailored
to
its
election-day
conditions
as
long
as
that
zone
reasonably
serves
the
purposes
which
justify
it.
laws
similar
to
tennessee
have
been
outstanding
over
this
country
for
the
past
century.
they
have
effectively
served
their
purpose.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
47
states
have
such
laws.
the
distances
run
from
25
feet
to
the
maximum...
hawaii
has
1,000
feet.
most
of
them
range
between
50
feet
and
200
feet.
100
feet
is
fairly
typical.
i
think
something
like
17
to
18
of
the
states
have
100
feet.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
47
regulate
outside
of
the
polling
place;
3
other
states
have
laws
that
regulate,
but
only
in
the
polling
place.
that's
only
three
states.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
political
campaigns
are
emotionally
charged
events.
and
i
think
we
have
to
put
it
in
the
proper
context.
they
may
be,
for
those
campaigners
and
candidates,
the
most
emotionally
charged
events
in
our
national
culture.
on
election
day,
all
of
this
emotion,
excitement,
and
tension
is
focused
right
on
the
polling
place.
campaign
workers
aren't
always
cool
and
reasoned
on
election
day.
polling
places
are
in
all
kinds
of
neighborhoods,
the
peaceful
and
the
rough.
the
entrances
to
polling
places
form
a
natural
bottleneck.
now,
if
you
allow
campaigning
at
those
bottlenecks,
you're
going
to
get
crowds.
voters
and
campaign
workers
alike
are
going
to
intermingle.
the
sale
pitches
are
going
to
go
through
the
crowd
and
over
the
crowd.
they
will
not
always
be
softly
spoken.
in
many
situations
they'll
be
shouting,
jostling,
and
tempers
may
flair.
the
effect
of
these
conditions
will
be
disorder,
disruptive
noise,
reaching
the
polling
place,
delays
in
voting.
these
conditions
elevate
the
chances
for
voter
intimidation.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
tennessee
has
both
voter
intimidation
laws
and
voter
interference
laws,
and
it's
our
position
that
what
the
state
has
done
and
what
the
states
have
done
is
through
these
zones
is
created
at
prophylactic.
once
there
is
intimidation,
once
there
in
interference,
the
purposes
of
the
state
have
been
defeated.
they
are
basically
after-the-fact
type
remedies.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
there
have
been--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
they
may
so
do...
no,
our...
on
election
day,
there's
plenty
of
advertising
on
tv
on
tennessee
in
the
morning,
particular.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
let
me
make
this.
except
for
a
limited
situation,
our...
the
primary
concern
is
not
just
the
annoyance,
although
we
think
at
a
certain
point
that
does
become
a
constitutionally
protectable
interest
by
the
state.
but
what
the
states
are
concerned
with
is
this
crowding.
the
increased
opportunity
for
the
intimidation
and
for
the
interference.
it
creates
a
zone
which
would...
which
much
reduces
the
risk
to
have
to
apply,
justice
o'connor,
those
intimidation
laws
and
the
interference
laws.
now
aside
from
that,
aside
from
criminal
intimidation
and
criminal
interference,
the
crowd
that
gathers
itself
around
the
entrance
to
the
polling
place
can
be
intimidating.
voting
cuts
across
all
character
types;
all
types
of
americans
go
to
vote.
and
what
may
not
be
intimidating
to
a
30-year
old
lawyer
going
to
the
polls
may
well
intimidate
an
elderly
citizen
going
or
a
first-time
voter.
and
rather
than
choose
to
run
the
gauntlet,
they
may
well
just
choose
to
turn
around
and
go
home.
and
that
defeats
the
purposes
of
maximizing
voter
participation.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
the
latter
part
is
right;
the
first
part
is
not
right.
tennessee
law
prohibits
the
distribution
of
campaign
literature--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--whether
it's
for
that
election
or
a
future
election.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
there
could
be
a
hari
krishna
stand
or
there
could
be
a
hot
dog
vendor
or
selling
tuna
sandwiches.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
we
certainly
would
say
that
it
is.
when
you
look
at--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--well
i
think
you
look
to
see
whether
the
regulation
is
only
justified
with
reference
to
the
content
of
the
speech.
and
in
this
case,
there
is
no
sinister
inference,
sinister
as
to
the
first
amendment,
that
offends
the
first
amendment
as
to
why
campaigning
in
tennessee
is
prohibited,
but
other
types
of
activities
aren't.
the
reason
the
other
activities
aren't
prohibited
is
they
have
just
never
been
a
problem
in
tennessee.
they
just
weren't
thought
of
when
the
legislature
did
this.
the
legislature
focused
on
election
reform.
and
when
it
thought
of
election
reform,
it
thought
of
the
problems
that
are
created.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
think
what
this
court,
in
looking
and
mosley
and
kerry,
what
those...
where
the
legislature
specifically
exempted
a
labor
picketing,
and
what
the
court
seemed
to
say
was
look,
we
can't
see
any
difference
between
labor
picketing
and
other
type
of
picketing.
they'll
both
have
the
same
type
of
effect.
so
what
the
court,
it
seems
to
me
concluded
was,
that
the
statute
was
directed
at
a
particular
type
of
expression
because
of
the
content
of
that
expression,
and
that's
labor
picketing.
we
just
don't
have
this.
i
can't...
the
failure
to
include
a
hot
dog
vendor
or
a
book
salesman
or
a
hari
krishna
booth
just
has
never
been
a
problem
in
relation
to
elections.
there
is...
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
absolutely.
that's
absolutely
correct.
and
if
hot
dog
vendors
become
a
problem
and
if
the
hari
krishna
groups
become
a
problem,
then
the
legislature
could
legislate
to
guard
these
same
interests.
but
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
certainly
it
would
have
been
content
neutral
as
passed,
and
in
terms
of
the
motivation.
now
to
preserve
it,
would
that
mean
that
it
would
become
unconstitutional
at
that
point
in
time?
i
think
at
that
point
in
time
it
would
begin
to
raise
a
question
as
to
whether
this
was
intended
actually
to
serve
those
purposes.
i
think
that's
what
the
court...
that's
the
standard
that
the
court
has
to
look
at
in
making
that
content-neutral
determination.
does
the
statute
serve
the
purposes
which
it
says
justified,
or
does
the
regulation
serve
those
purposes,
and
are
those
purposes
related
to
the
content
of
the
speech.
and
if
you
took
your
hypothetical
far
enough,
you
might
begin
to
raise
the...
raise
a
question
about
what
the
real
purpose
of
the
statute
was.
but
that
doesn't
exist
here.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes,
there
may
be
a
portion
of
a
sidewalk
that
would
be
encompassed
within
the
100
feet.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
and
some
of
them
may
even
extend
into
a
street.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
we
don't
think
that
it
affects
the
outcome.
depending
upon
how
you
interpret
this
election
zone
as
a
public
forum
or
not,
even
where
it
crosses
a
traditional
public
fora,
you
might
have...
if
it's
a
public
fora,
we
would
suggest
the
time,
place,
or
manner
restriction.
we
would...
express
that
the
court
basically
apply
the
balancing
test
that
it
applies
when
election
laws
are
contested.
and
further,
we
think
there's
an
argument,
justice
o'connor,
that
even
where
on
this
1
day
both
private
and
public
places
are
taken
over
by
the
government,
taken
control
of
and
administered
by
the
government
for
this
one
purpose,
that
an
argument
could
be
fashioned
and
is
very
credible
that
even
where
it
hits
a
sidewalk,
that
that,
in
fact,
is
a
nonpublic
fora.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
yes.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
things
we
are
suggesting.
just
if
you
have
a
street
fair
where
the
area
of
both
the
sidewalks
and
the
street
are
roped
off--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--and
no
other
activities.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
25
feet,
your
honor,
we
would
suggest
is
purely
a
difference
of
degree,
and
not
in
kind.
and
if
25
feet
is
okay,
100
feet
is
okay.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
no,
the
statute
has
a
provision
in
it
for
300-feet
limit.
that
is
not
operative.
our
office
issued
and
opinion
basically
based
upon
state
constitutional
grounds
that
said
the
population
classifications
as
to
that
300-foot
limit
were
not
rational,
and
under
specific
provision
of
our
state
constitution,
it
would
not
stand.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
the
statute
actually
allows
poll
watchers
inside
the
polling
place.
it
allows,
i
think,
one
per
candidate,
and
two
per
political
party.
but
that's
very
closely
regulated
in
terms
of--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--do
you
mean
outside
the
context
of
the
election
zone?
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
i
think
there
are
laws
that
do
regulate
your
use.
for
instance,
there's
a
law
that
requires
you
to
get
a
permit.
you
could
take...
if
you're
going
to
have
5,000
people
at
a
public
park
or
something,
you
have
to
take
out
a
permit
that's
regulated.
and
you
can
then
cut
that
area
off
for
those
exclusive
purposes.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
would
say
that
our
theory
is
that
what
we
are
expressing
is
limited
to
these
election
zones.
you
have
to
look
at
the
very
fundamental
interests
and
what
the
state's
duty
is
that
would
justify
such
a
zone.
and
that's
as
far
as
we're
going
in
this
argument.
what...
it
appears
to
us
that
the
court,
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
failed
to
address
this
issue
in
a
real-world
context.
it
basically
took
the
theoretical
proposition
that
because
all
subject
matter
was
not
included,
that
that,
per
se,
triggered
content
based.
we've
discussed
that
before
and
we
do
not
think
that
is
a
proper
approach.
we
think
more
inquiry
needs
to
go
beyond
that
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
purposes
are
justified
without
reference
to
the
content
of
the
speech.
but
basically
they
failed
to
consider
this
in
a
real-world
context,
and
that's
also
revealed
in
its
failure
to
deal
with
the
substantive
constitutional
legal
distinction.
the
concluding
analysis
of
the
tennessee
court
demonstrates
this.
the
court
suggested
25
feet
might
meet
constitutional
muster.
it
must
be
assumed,
then
that
the
court
recognized
the
state's
constitutionally
protectable
interest
outside
the
polling
place.
however,
the
alternative
that
the
court
suggested,
25
feet
instead
of
100
feet,
is
one
of
degree.
such
a
difference
doesn't
have
a
constitutional
significance.
it's
not
a
true
alternative
in
kind.
if
i
might,
the
dissent
in
this
case--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i
think
that
question,
justice
stevens,
goes
to
the
one
that
justice
kennedy
raised.
the
state
would
have
to
be
able
to
show
that
the
statute
is
fashioned
to
serve
these
legitimate
purposes
which
justify
them.
there
is
a
point
that
you
could
get
out
which
brings
into
question
the
true
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
we
would...
we
would
suggest
that
it
is.
just
like
in
buckley,
the
difference
between
2,000
feet
and
1,000
feet
was
a
difference
in
degree,
i
think
the
court
can
observe
for
itself
25
feet
to
the
end
of
the
press
section,
and
almost
100
across
this
is...
the
same
issues
are
implicated.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
you
know,
this
was
basically
a
facial
challenge.
the
evidence,
quite
frankly,
was
very
skimpy.
i
could
draw
as
many
hypotheticals
whether
25
feet
went
onto
a
sidewalk
or
went
into
the
street.
once
you
acknowledge...
it's
our
position,
once
you
acknowledge
the
interest
outside
the
polling
place,
then
it's
the
legislature,
and
there
should
be
a
presumption
of
constitutionality,
who
is
in
the
best
position,
through
experience
and
the
studies
they're
able
to
do,
to
determine
what
that
appropriate
distance
would
be.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
there
was
an...
there
was
an
extensive...
there
was
an
extensive
law
review
commission,
although
they
were
fairly
conclusory
in
the
results.
we
would
point
to
the
court's
decision
in
monroe,
which
suggests,
and
we
think
it's
perfectly
fitting
here,
that
the
state
in
these
type
of
cases,
shouldn't
have
to
suffer
the
harm
before
it
addresses
the
problem
and
that
the
state,
to
sustain
these
facial
challenges,
the
state
is
not
required
to
put
on
the
specific
proof
of
the
damage
and
the
confusion
and
the
overcrowding.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
we
would
suggest
that--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--no,
sir.
it
was
raised
and
then
never
mentioned
again.
the
constitutional
provisions
were
raised--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--right
in
the
beginning,
but
this
was
solely
decided
upon
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
way
the
tennessee
supreme
court
construed
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
i
think
that's
very
interesting,
justice
blackmun.
after
this
decision,
there
was
nothing
to
prohibit
this.
there
was
an
election
coming
up
in
november,
and
i
think
the
decision
came
down
in
october.
they
struck
this
statute
down
and
there
was
nothing
to
preclude
this
type
of
electioneering.
the
state,
we
went
in
and
asked
for
a
stay.
the
argument
was
raised
that
well,
there
are
these
criminal
statutes
in
effect
that
will
take
care
of
this
problem,
and
the
supreme
court
stayed
its
decision.
so
as
of
today
the
law
is...
they
determine
unconstitutional,
is
still
outstanding
in
tennessee.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
very
brief,
i
hope,
your
honor.
the
question
was
raised
about
the
state's
position
regarding
someone
advocating
the
election
of
someone
that
was
not
on
the
ballot.
and
i
think
justice
o'connor
started
with
that
question.
on
page
11
of
respondent's
brief,
they
set
the
predicate
for
that
up.
they
say
the
state's
witness
testified
that
a
person
is
permitted
to
distribute
handbills
within
the
100-foot
boundary
on
behalf
of
a
political
figure
who
is
not
standing
for
election
on
that
day's
ballot.
however,
the
record
on
page
43
of
the
appendix,
the
testimony
was:
question:
okay,
if
a
person
were
distributing
handbills
on
behalf
of
a
political
figure
who
was
not
standing
for
election
on
that
day,
could
that
person
do
that
inside
the
100-foot
boundary.
the
unequivocal
answer
was
no,
they
could
not.
so
we
would
say
the
predicate
for
that
position
is
not
there.
there
was
a
further
discussion,
could
someone
on
the
ballot
just
generally
hand
out
literature
that
said
they
had
a
good
record.
there
was
a
suggestion,
well,
if
they
were
on
the
ballot
they
couldn't.
if
they
weren't
on
the
ballot,
they
could.
but
it
is
clear...
a
reading
of
the
statute...
it
doesn't
distinguish
between
whether
it's
on
the
ballot
or
not
on
the
ballot
if
it's
campaign
activity.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
clearly
defined
campaign
activity
as
that
which
is
outcome
determinative
advocacy.
it's
the
position,
and
clearly
the
position,
of
the
state
that
such
conduct
would
be
prohibited.
one
other
point.
it's
not
just
what
goes
on
outside
of
the
polling
place,
but
also
if
you've
got
a
crowd,
and
you've
got
the
noise,
and
you've
got
the
campaign
happen...
taking
place
either
right
outside
of
the
polling
place,
which
is
what
respondents
advocate,
or
even
within
25
feet,
we
would
suggest
that
noise
is
going
to
reach
inside
the
polling
place.
and
that
noise,
in
and
of
itself,
is
going
to
distract
polling
officials.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
i
think
we
would
have
to
apply
the
standard
is
outcome
determinative
advocacy.
obviously
if
there
were
an
abortion
question
on
the
ballot--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--just
a...
it's
kind
of,
i
guess,
like
the
hari
krishna...
if
somebody
is
just
saying
we're
for
or
against--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--we're
for
or
against...
no,
but
it
really...
it
just--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--i
think
that
just
a
general
statement
that
was
not
directed
at
an
outcome
either
for
this
or
another
election
would
be
permitted.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
well,
you
know,
it
might
if
it
were
happening,
and
if
that
became
the
case,
the
state
is
empowered
to
restrict
that.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
this
statute,
if
it's
not
outcome
determinative
advocacy,
this
statute
would
not
prohibit
it.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
tee-shirts
and
campaign
buttons
are
restricted
under
this
statute.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
a
voter
is
asked
to
take
the
campaign
button
off
as
they
go
in.
it's
our
position...
look,
buttons
and
tee-shirts
and
hats
and
signs
are
all
part
of
campaigning
activity.
they
all
implicate
and
invite
the
same
problems.
when
you
start--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--yeah.
that
is
a
hypothetical--
mr.
charles
w.
burson
--we
would
suggest
that
if
someone
were
to
get
arrested
for
that,
you'd
have
to
look
at
it
on
an
as-applied
basis.
we
don't
think
it
implicates
this
statute.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
no.
there's
not
an
exception
to
the
statute.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
that
is
not
an
exception
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
w.
burson
exactly.
and
what
you're
looking
at
is,
is
it
campaign
activity.
are
they
doing
this
to
advocate
the
candidacy
within
that
zone.
that's
exactly
what
we're
looking
at.
certainly,
there
may
well
be
a
due
process
problem
in
an
as-applied
situation
or
some
other
place
as
applied,
but
it
doesn't
implicate
this
statute
facially.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
