feet
more...
closer.
so
what's
your
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
herbison,
you
say
it
creates
a
first
amendment
problem
because
you're
relying
on
something
called
the
traditional
public
forum
doctrine.
don't
you
take
the
traditional
public
forum
with
the
limitations
that
tradition
imposes
upon
traditional
public
forums?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
my
point.
has
it
been
dedicated
under
the
traditional
public
forum
doctrine?
as
general
burson
pointed
out,
there
are
a
lot
of
these
statutes
now,
but
not
only
are
not...
are
they
around
now...
the
earliest
one
i
find
goes
back
to
1875.
and
between
1889
and
1905,
there
are
at
least
22
states
that
had
statutes
like
this,
and
another
6
that
had
statutes
completely
barring
people
within
100
feet.
so
don't
you
take
the
traditional
public
forum
doctrine
the
way
you
find
it?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
has
been
done
a
long
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
you
want
to
give
the
doctrine
a
new
name
then?
we
should
not
call
it
the
traditional
public
forum
doctrine
since
we
are
not
at
all
adverting
to
what
tradition
said
about
it.
i
mean,
what
i'm
saying
is
this
has
been
going
on
for
at
least
a
century,
indeed
for
probably
half
a
century
longer
than
there
was
even
such
a
thing
as
the
traditional
public
forum
doctrine.
we
either
have
to
rename
the
doctrine
or
come
out
against
you
in
this
case,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
herbison,
suppose
you
have
a
municipally
owned
subway
or
trolley
car
line
which
carries
advertising,
but
decides
not
to
carry
political
advertising,
just
because
it
upsets
people.
they're
hassled
enough
on
the
way
home
from
work,
and
they
don't
have
to
look
at
partisan
political
posters,
so
they
just
ban
political
advertising
to
this
captive
audience,
because
the
people
have
to
ride
the
subway
or
the
trolley
home.
is
that
constitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
suggests
that
it
is
because
it's
sort
of
a
captive
audience,
right?
and
isn't
it
sort
of
a
captive
audience,
when
the
only
way
you
can
get
to
the
polling
place
is
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
electioneering?
but
i
don't
want
to
listen
to
electioneering.
i
mean,
suppose
i'm
a
citizen
saying,
you
know,
i've
read
the
papers,
i've
made
up
my
mind.
i
don't
want
to
be
hassled
by
these
people.
now
you're
free
to
hassle
me,
but
i'm
free
not
to
be
hassled
in
a
coerced
situation.
isn't
that
a
reasonable
basis
for
these
statutes?
justice
antonin
scalia
with
listeners
in
a
captive
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
workers
are
not
allowed
to
say
there,
just
repeating,
you
know,
vote
for
so
and
so,
he's
a
fine
man.
he
believe
in
family...
he's
just
shouting
that
at
the
top
of
his
lungs.
could
a
worker
do
that
under
your
theory.
he
could
do
that,
couldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
i
have
to
plug
my
ears
just
as
the
person
coming
home
from
work
in
the
subway
will
just
have
to
cover
his
eyes.
just
don't
look
at
the
political
poster
if
you
don't
want
to
look
at
it.
but
i
suggest
that
we
haven't
held
that
with
respect
to
political
posters
in
the
subway,
so
why
should
we
do
it,
why
should
we
hold
that
with
respect
to
political
chance
at
the
polling
booth?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course...
perhaps
with
good
reason.
i
mean,
some
people...
you
know,
maybe
in
chicago,
at
least,
somebody
might
intentionally
drive
down
the
street
with
a
bumper
sticker
on,
or
intentionally
park
his
car
within
100
feet
of
the
polling
place.
that
might
happen,
mightn't
it?
