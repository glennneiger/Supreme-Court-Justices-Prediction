suppose
if
the
town
can
give
a
group
a
parade
permit
that
in
effect
preempts
10
blocks
of
a
city
street
that
other
people
can't
drive
down
in
their
cars,
they
can't
occupy
the
place.
that
part
of
the
street
is
reserved
for
a
specific
purpose.
and
you're
just
suggesting,
i
suppose,
that
this
part
of
the

and
i
suppose
if
this
statute
is
immediately
suspect
because
of
lack
of
content
neutrality,
i
suppose
that
so
would
a
statute
which
prevents
electioneering
inside

itself.

justice

does
your
statute
permit
official
poll
watchers
to...
within
100
feet?
justice

white
suppose
two
friends
go
to
the
polls
together
and
they're
supporting
different
candidates,
and
as
they
get
within
the
100-foot
area,
they're
supposed
to
quit
trying
to
confer

each
other.

well,
that
may
be.
the
statute
wouldn't
necessarily
be
void
on
its
face
just
because
of
that.
