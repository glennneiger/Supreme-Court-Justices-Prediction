general
burson,
don't
some
states
also
have
other
prohibitions
such
as
use
of
the
media
on
election
day?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
by
media
i
mean
television,
for
instance.
advertising
on
television.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
under
the
impression...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
know
my
home
state
has
a
statute
prohibiting
political
advertising
on
election
day
in
television.
does
tennessee
have
such
a
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
must
confess
that
when
i
came,
we
happened
to
live
across
the
river
in
virginia,
that
i
was
almost
offended
by
the
presence
of
people
handing
out
literature
within
25
feet
of
the
polling
place.
one
would
be
put
in
the
jug
in
minnesota
if
he
did
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
correct.
general
burson,
what
is
the
situation
in
tennessee
elections
today?
is
there
a
stay
in
effect
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
second
case
is
no.
90-1056,
burson
versus
freeman.
tennessee
has
a
statute
which
prohibits
the
solicitation
of
votes
and
the
display
or
distribution
of
campaign
materials
within
100
feet
of
the
entrance
to
a
polling
place
on
election
day.
respondent,
while
she
was
the
treasurer
for
a
political
campaign
in
tennessee,
brought
this
state
court
action
alleging
that
the
statute
limited
her
ability
to
communicate
with
voters
and
that
this
was
in
violation
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
state
court
dismissed
the
suit
but
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
reversed.
it
ruled
that
the
state
had
a
compelling
interest
in
banning
such
activities
within
the
polling
place
itself
but
not
on
the
surrounding
premises,
and
it
therefore
concluded
that
the
100-foot
limit
was
not
narrowly
tailored
to
protect
the
state's
interest
and
was
not
the
least
restrictive
means
to
serve
those
interests.
i
have
the
judgment
of
this
court
to
announce.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
tennessee
supreme
court
and
remand
the
case.
the
chief
justice,
justice
white,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
conclude
that
the
statute
does
not
violate
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
o'connor
and
justice
souter
have
joined.
justice
thomas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
