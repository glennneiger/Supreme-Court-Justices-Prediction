general
burson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
our
cases
have
said,
too,
haven't
they,
general,
that
the
legislature
can
deal
with
the
evil
where
it
finds
it.
it
doesn't
have
to
go
all
the
way
if
it
doesn't
find
the
evil
going
beyond
a
certain
point.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
burson.
mr.
herbison,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.

rehnquist
a
nontraditional
public
forum
doctrine.
chief
justice

h.
rehnquist
mr.
herbison,
to
follow
up
on
justice
scalia's
inquiry,
you
say
this
is...
this
area
is
dedicated
to
expressive
activity,
i.e.,
voting.
but
it's
dedicated
with
the
proviso
that
you
can't
electioneer
within
25...
or
within
100
feet.
i
mean,
you
have
to
take
the
proviso
as
well
as
the
dedication,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
herbison.
general
burson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
burson.
the
case
is
submitted.
