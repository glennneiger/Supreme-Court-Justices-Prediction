mr.
john
e.
herbison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
order
to
understand
why
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
is
correct,
both
in
its
result
and
in
its
reasoning,
it
is
necessary
to
examine
exactly
how
this
statute,
which
is
a
criminal
statute,
affects
free
speech
at
polling
places.
the
statute
operates
basically
in
three
different
geographical
locations.
the
statute
prohibits
the
solicitation
of
votes,
display,
or
distribution
of
campaign
literature
or
materials
inside
the
polling
place
itself.
that
is
not
the
subject
of
the
plaintiff's
challenge
to
this
statute.
the
plaintiff
has
never
averred
any
intention
to
solicit
votes
inside
the
polling
place
and
they--
mr.
john
e.
herbison
--justice
o'connor,
inside
the
polling
place,
the
state's
interest
is
monumentally
greater
than
outside.
inside
the
polling
place,
the
election
is
actually
being
conducted.
there
is
a
much
greater
risk
inside
the
polling
place
of
interference
with
the
election
officials'
duties
or
with
interference
with
the
actual
conduct
of
the
election.
mr.
john
e.
herbison
that
is
correct,
as
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
found.
mr.
john
e.
herbison
it
is
the
same
test.
and
we
submit
that
the
court
below
reached
the
correct
conclusion
that
the
state's
interest
is
greater
inside...
inside
the
building.
mr.
john
e.
herbison
well,
clearly
a
25-foot
boundary
would
be
more
nearly
constitutional
than
the
100
or
300-foot
boundary
currently
enforced.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
e.
herbison
however,
we
do
not--
mr.
john
e.
herbison
--we
do
not.
if
it
were
a
regulation
that,
as
this
one
does,
singled
out
core
political
speech
within
that
25-foot
radius,
we
submit
that
that
hypothetical
statute
would
suffer
from
the
same
defect
as
the
current
100-foot
or
300-foot
boundary.
outside
the
polling
place,
a
radius
of
100
feet
in
most
of
the
state,
of
300
feet
in
some
counties...
and
that
300-foot
boundary
has
not
been
addressed
by
any
court,
even
though
the
attorney
general
has
given
an
opinion
that
that
violates
the
state
constitution.
it
is
still
in
force
and
has
not
been
addressed
by
any
court,
the
distinction
between
300
feet
and
100
feet.
in
light
of
the
disposition
that
the
tennessee
supreme
court
made
in
this
case,
it
was
not
necessary
for
them
to
reach
that,
even
though
it
was
raised
in
the
pleadings.
within
that
prohibit...
within
that
radius,
the
solicitation
of
votes,
display
or
distribution
of
campaign
materials
or
literature
is
outlawed.
in
cases
where
the
grounds
of
the
polling
place
extend
beyond
the
100-foot
or
300-foot
buffer
zone,
on
the
areas
outside
the
buffer
zone
and
still
on
the
grounds
of
the
polling
place,
it
would
appear
that
purely
verbal
solicitation
is
permitted,
but
the
display
of
material
is
still
prohibited
on
the
grounds
of
polling
places.
the
kinds
of
things
forbidden
by
this
statute
extend
to
a
campaign
worker
carrying
a
political
sign.
a
voter
wearing
a
tee-shirt
with
the
name
of
his
preferred
candidate
going
into
the
polling
place
would
risk
criminal
prosecution.
a
broad
range
of
pure
political
speech
is
prohibited
by
this
statute,
and
the
statute
reaches
only
pure
political
speech,
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
is
deserving
of
the
greatest
level
of
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
john
e.
herbison
that
would
be
correct,
at
least
to
the
extent
of
any
kind
of
solicitation
of
one
of
the
other
to
vote
his
way.
that
would
be
prohibited.
mr.
john
e.
herbison
this
statute
would
prohibit
that.
that
would
clearly
be
the
display
of
campaign
material.
mr.
john
e.
herbison
not
necessarily
just
because
of
that.
however,
singling
out
pure
political
speech
and
leaving
other
messages
unaffected
presents
clear
first
amendment
problems.
mr.
john
e.
herbison
justice
scalia,
in
this
case
we
have
a
public
forum
property
dedicated...
have
properties
dedicated
to
expressive
activity
by
governmental
fiat,
that
is,
voting.
mr.
john
e.
herbison
well,
your
honor,
this
is,
we
submit,
is
a
case
of
the
public
forum
by
government
fiat.
this
court
recognized,
united
states
v.
classic,
that
voting
is
expressive
activity.
it
is
the
expression
by
electors
of
their
choice
of
candidates.
mr.
john
e.
herbison
well,
whatever
label
this
court
chooses
to
affix
is--
mr.
john
e.
herbison
--of
course,
there
is
an
element
of
the
public
forum
doctrine
that
addresses
properties
which
are
public
forum
by
governmental
edict,
which
is,
we
submit,
what
we
have
here.
voting
is
expressive
activity.
discussion
of
candidates
and
qualification
of
candidates
is
an
integral
part
of
the
electoral
process.
this
court
recognized
such
cases
as
mills
v.
alabama--
mr.
john
e.
herbison
--well,
we
submit
the
legislature
is
not
empowered
to
impose
that
kind
of
restriction
singling
out
a
particular
type
of
speech.
it's
clear
that
the
legislature
cannot
prohibit
discussion
of
candidates
on
election
day,
as
was
the
case
in
mills
v.
alabama.
there
was
dictum
in
that
case
suggesting
that
conduct
at
polling
places
can
be
regulated.
but
that
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
speech,
especially
pure
political
speech,
is
entitled
to
greater
protection
than
communicative
conduct.
this
is
a
case
where
we
have
pure
speech
restricted
and
not
even
all
political
speech
is
prohibited
within
this
buffer
zone,
contrary
to
general
burson's
assertion.
the
state's
witness
clearly
testified
that
political
solicitations
on
behalf
of
candidates
who
are
not
on
that
day's
ballot
are
permitted
within
the
100-foot
boundary...
pages
40...
excuse
me,
pages
43
and
44
of
the
joint
appendix,
before
this
court
is
the
first
time
that
the
attorney
general
has
tried
to
put
any
distance
between
the
state's
position
and
the
state's
witness'
position.
to
illustrate
the
operation
of
the
statute,
tennessee
holds
presidential
preference
primaries
in
march,
and
in
august,
holds
another
primary
election
for
various
other
offices...
united
states
senator,
governor,
united
states
house
of
representatives,
and
some
others.
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
state's
witness,
ms.
freeman
could
lawfully
stand
10
feet
away
from
the
door
of
a
polling
place
in
august
of
1992,
advocate
the
reelection
or
defeat
of
president
bush,
who
is
not
on
that
day's
ballot
but
who
would
be
on
the
november
ballot
3
months
later.
however,
if
her
message
were
reelect
congressman
clement,
then
she
would
risk
going
to
jail.
the
focus
of
the
statute,
the
narrow
focus
on
a
particular
political
candidate
strongly
suggests
that
the
legislative
intention
was
to
suppress
speech
related
to
particular
speech
when
interest
in
that
particular
message
was
at
its
peak.
the
statute
also
restricts,
not
only
restricts
the
right
of
political
campaign
workers
to
speak,
it
restricts
the
right
of
voters
to
receive
information.
this
court
has
recognized
that
first
amendment
protects
the
right
to
receive
information
as
well
as
the
right
to
disseminate
it.
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
correctly
applied
the
strict
scrutiny
test,
correctly
found
that
this
is
clearly
a
content-based
statute
because
it
reaches
only
one
category
of
speech.
the
attorney
general
takes
the
position
that
this
is
merely
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation.
mr.
john
e.
herbison
well,
certainly
the
lehman
decision
suggests
that
it
is.
mr.
john
e.
herbison
well,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
reaction
of
a
listener
to
speech
projected
his
way
is
not
a
valid
basis
for
limiting
first
amendment
rights.
cases
decided
more
recently
than
lehman--
mr.
john
e.
herbison
--well,
a
listener
is
to
some
extent
in
a
captive
situation
here,
but
not
to
the
same
extent
as
in
lehman.
mr.
john
e.
herbison
this
is
the
kind
of
situation
that
presupposes
a
speaker
and
a
willing
listener
if...
well,
the
purpose
of
the
speaker
being
here
is
to
persuade
the
voter
to
cast
his
vote
in
a
particular
manner.
where
the
voter
clearly
does
not
want
to
be
bothered,
the
campaign
worker
will
surely
give
that
voter
a
wide
berth,
let
him
proceed
on
to
the
polling
place.
however,
in
the
case
of
a
willing
listener,
who
is
willing
to
stand
aside,
out
of
the
flow
of
traffic,
and
listen
to
the
campaign
worker's
pitch,
that's
not
a
captive
audience
situation.
human
nature
is
going
to
be
basically
regulated--
mr.
john
e.
herbison
--he
could
do
that
so
long
as--
mr.
john
e.
herbison
--in
the
case
of
the
subway
or
public
transit,
the
government
is
operating
in
essentially
a
proprietary
capacity.
in
the
case
of
a
polling
place,
the
government,
or
at
least
the
state
government
makes
only
limited
temporary
use
of
the
facilities.
this
is
not
a
case
like
a
subway
car
or
like
the
post
office
where
the
government
is
operating
in
a
proprietary
capacity.
the
attorney
general
contends
that
this
is
merely
a
time,
manner,
and
place
regulation.
we
submit
that
that
is
incorrect.
but
even
if
that
contingent
were
correct,
even
if
the
statute
were
content
neutral,
this
statute
prohibits
a
broad
range
of
speech,
far
more
than
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
asserted
justifications
for
the
statute.
even
under
the
time,
place,
and
manner
test,
this
statute
is
not
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
the
asserted
ends.
the
government's
only
justification
asserted
before
the
trial
court
was
the
prospect
of
interference
with
the
voting
process,
overcrowding
of
the
polling
room
itself.
and
there
is
really
no
proof,
as
the
state
court
noted,
to
suggest
that
activity
outside
the
polling
place
is
going
to
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
conduct
of
the
election
inside.
therefore,
no
matter
what
the
standard
of
review
is,
the
strict
scrutiny
that
the
state
court
applied,
or
the
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation
that
the
attorney
general
contends
for,
this
statute
fails
either
test.
we
submit
that
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
reached
the
correct
result
and
applied
the
correct
reasoning.
if
the
court
has
no
further
question,
that
concludes
my
remarks.
