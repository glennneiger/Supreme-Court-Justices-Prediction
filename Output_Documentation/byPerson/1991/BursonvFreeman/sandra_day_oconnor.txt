how
many
states
have
such
laws?
and
do
most
of
them
provide
for
a
100-foot
limit
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
burson,
what
are
the
purposes
of
those
laws
as
you
see
them
and
in
your
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
other
state
laws
governing
interruption
around
the
polls
of
voters...
voter
intimidation
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
tennessee's
law
does
not
prohibit
campaigning
for
a
candidate
in
some
other
election
and
it
doesn't
prohibit
solicitation
of
commercial
products
and
that
sort
of
thing.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
whether
it's
for
that
election
or
any
other?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
commercial
products
and
so
forth,
there
could
be
a
hari
krishna
stand
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
cases
from
this
court,
such
as
kerry
and
mosley,
where
the
court
has
said
that
a
state
can't
regulate
some
but
not
all
potentially
disruptive
expression?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
burson,
the
regulation
here
would
extend
in
some
areas
to
public
streets
and
public
sidewalks,
if
they
were
within
the
100-foot
limit.
is
that
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
affect
the
constitutional
analysis
at
all,
do
you
think,
where
it's
a
traditional
public
forum
that's
affected?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
herbison,
would
you
think
the
same
standard
and
test
should
be
applied
to
regulations
inside
the
polling
place
as
outside?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
there's
just
a
more
compelling
state
interest
inside.
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
otherwise
the
test
applied
would
be
the
same.
it's
just
the
value
or
weight
you
place
on
the
state's
interest
in
your
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
defend
the
court's
decision
that
the
regulation
can
extend
to
25
feet
but
not
100?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
defend
the
holding
of
the
court
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
the
statute
prohibit
a
person
from
driving
down
a
public
street
that
was
within
the
100-foot
limit
with
a
bumper
sticker
on
the
car
that
was
in
support
of
a
candidate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
a
bumper
sticker
on
a
car
driving
by
on
the
street
that
happens
to
fall
within
the
100-foot
limit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
no
exception
in
the
statute
to
take
it
out
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
the
car
that
parks
in
the
parking
lot
within
the
100-foot
limit
and
has
bumper
stickers
on
it
for
candidates.
