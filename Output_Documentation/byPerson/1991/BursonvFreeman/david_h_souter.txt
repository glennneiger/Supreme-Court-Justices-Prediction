justice
david
h.
souter
general,
when
you
say
the
states
have
such
laws,
do
you
mean
they
have
laws
regulating
conduct
not
only
in
the
polling
place
itself
under
the
roof,
but
laws
regulating
areas
outside?
are
there
47
that
regulate
outside
the
polling
place?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
your
argument
allow
a
state
to
enact
a
statute
designating
certain
traditional
public
forums,
portions
of
sidewalks
or
public
parks
and
so
on,
as
sort
of
free
zones
solely
for
recreation
or
commerce
so
long
as
they
did
not
do
so
based
on,
at
least
on
the
content
of
the
speech
that
might
otherwise
take
place
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
how
broad
is
your
principle
of
the
state
may
sort
of
eliminate
the
traditional
public
forum
character
of
public
forums?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
my
examples?
sort
of
communication-free
zones
where
people
can
go
and
not
be
bothered
in
otherwise
public
forums?
is
the
state
on
your
theory
free
to
do
that?
