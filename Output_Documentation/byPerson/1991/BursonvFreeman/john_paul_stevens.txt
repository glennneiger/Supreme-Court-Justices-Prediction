but
if
that
argument
is
valid,
i
suppose
it
would
be
okay
to
have
3,000-foot
limit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
tennessee
supreme
court
said
100
feet
is
too
much,
but
25
feet
isn't.
why
is
that
any
more
a
matter
of
degree
than
your
argument
about
3,000
feet
against
100?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
one
of
the
differences
the
court
pointed
was
that
the
evidence,
as
i
remembered,
really
related
to
what
happened
either
in
the
polls
or
right
outside
the
door.
and
that
if
you
go
the
full
100
feet,
you
pick
up
the
sidewalk
and
so
forth
in
some
areas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
thing
i
think
they
said
you
didn't...
there
no
evidence
of
any
studies
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
i
suppose
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
more
knowledge
about
local
conditions
than
we
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
noticed
also
they
relied
in
part
on
the
tennessee
constitution,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
mentioned
it
in
their
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just,
on...
your
correction
on
page
43,
just
as
a
point
of
information.
there
was
also
a
question
about
distributing
handbills
that
say
abortion
is
murder,
would
that
be
permissible
or
not
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
assumption
was
there
was
no
abortion
question
on
the
ballot,
but
presumably
some
candidates
might
have
views
one
way
or
the
other
on
abortion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
not
really...
this
is
not
a
very
improbable
example,
i
don't
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
say
they
had
something,
reduce
the
deficit,
or
i'm
against
high
taxes,
no
more
taxes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
that
would
be
as
likely
to
provoke
fisticuffs
as
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah,
but
this
statute
wouldn't
restrict
it.
