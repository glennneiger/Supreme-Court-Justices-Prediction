justice
white
i
suppose
you
concede
that
if
quill
had
an
office
in
north
dakota
that...
and
solicited
out
of
there,
and
they
had
an
inventory,
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem,
would
there?
justice
white
that
has
hardly
balkanized
the
american
market.
justice
white
only
where
mail
order
houses
are
concerned.
justice
white
well,
that's
the
way
the
game
goes.
justice
white
you
mean
they're
collecting
the
tax?
justice
white
are
you
just
saying
we
were
flat
wrong
in
bellas
hess,
or
do
you
think
there
have
been
developments
since
them
that
make
bellas...
that
undermine
bellas
hess,
or
both?
justice
white
why
does
north
dakota
deserve
to
collect
the
tax?
that's
the
real...
sort
of
the
question,
i
would
think.
what
do
you
want
for
nothing?
justice
white
is
that
the
state?
justice
white
how
about
the
phone
lines?
justice
white
do
you
think
you
could
require
the
out-of-state
marketer
to
qualify
to
do
business
in
the
state?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
if
you
win
this
case,
you
would.
justice
white
how
do...
can
you
get
jurisdiction
over
these
out-of-state
sellers
in
your
own
courts?
justice
white
what,
under
your
long
arm
statute?
justice
white
under
your
long
arm
statute?
justice
white
well,
how
long
has...
the
north
dakota
law
has
been
in
its
present
form
only
since
you
changed
the
regulations
to
redefine
who
a
retailer
was?
justice
white
how
long
has
that
been?
justice
white
so
'87.
suppose
you
win
this
case
and...
so
you'll
go
back
to
'87,
i
guess,
to
collect?
justice
white
i
know,
but
i
suppose
you'll
try.
justice
white
who
would
you
try
to
collect
from?
justice
white
and
not
from
consumers.
justice
white
well,
i
just
thought
you
told
me...
you
told
us
that
all
these
marvelous
computer
developments
around,
so
everybody
knows
everything
about
everything.
[laughter]
you
could
find
out
in
a
flash
from
them.
