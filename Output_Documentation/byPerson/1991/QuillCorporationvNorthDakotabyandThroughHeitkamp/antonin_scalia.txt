justice
scalia
you
think
we
have
a
national
market
only
for
mail
order
businesses?
justice
scalia
well,
i
mean
that's
very
strange.
but
that's
what
your
argument
comes
down
to,
that
the
great
national
market
that
the
commerce
clause
set
up
really
only
works
for
mail
order
business,
because
certainly,
everybody
else
can
be
taxed
by
the
individual
states
that
they
do
business
in.
justice
scalia
i'm
saying
that
seems
to
me
a
very
limited
notion
of
what
the
founders'
vision
was.
but
if
that's
what
you
think
it
was.
justice
scalia
we
want
a
national
mail
order
telephone
market.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
you're
missing
my
point.
the
same
thing...
the
same
objection
could
be
made
by
the
company
that
doesn't
use
the
telephone,
but
uses
drummers.
justice
scalia
and
says,
my
goodness,
we
send
these
salesmen
out
into
the
so-called
national
market,
and
we're
going
to
be
taxed
by
every
one
of
these
jurisdictions.
and
you
say
that's
okay.
justice
scalia
you
don't
say
national
market
for
that,
do
you?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure
you're
understanding
me.
i
want
you
to
tell
me
why
this
is
worse
for
somebody
who
operates
by
telephone
or
mail
than
it
is
for
somebody
who
operates
by
sending
business
representatives
into
all
of
the
states.
justice
scalia
i
know
what
we've
done,
but
you're
elevating
it
to
a
point
of
principle
and
not
mere
fact.
justice
scalia
you're
saying
that
this
has
something
to
do
with
our
national
market.
justice
scalia
but
you're
perfectly
willing
to
have
the
national
market
fragmented
by
allowing
these...
how
many
thousands
of
jurisdictions...
tax
drummers,
except
for
the
benefit
of
a
federal
statute.
justice
scalia
as
mr.
gaggini
would
say,
that
shows
you
what
a
free
market
will
do.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
well,
you're
right
now
able
to
move
against
the
consumers,
i
guess.
right?
justice
scalia
mr.
gaggini
mentioned
that
some
states
require
filling
it
out
on
their
income
tax
returns.
did
you
make
any
out-of-state
purchases
over,
you
know--
