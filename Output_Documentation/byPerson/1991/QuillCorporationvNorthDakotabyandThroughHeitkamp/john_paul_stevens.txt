justice
stevens
what's
the...
i
don't
understand,
what's
the
significance
of
that?
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
you're
not
denying
you
have
a
sales...
a
competitive
advantage
over
those
who
pay
a
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
91-194,
quill
corporation
against
north
dakota.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota.
petitioner,
quill,
is
a
mail-order
house
that
maintains
neither
outlets
nor
sales
representatives
in
north
dakota.
this
case
involves
north
dakota's
efforts
to
require
quill
to
collect
and
pay
a
use
tax
on
goods
purchased
for
use
within
the
state.
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
upheld
the
state's
collection
effort
ruling
that
social,
economic,
and
legal
innovations
had
rendered
obsolete
our
1967
ruling
in
national
bellas
hess
versus
the
department
of
revenue.
in
that
case,
our
court
held
that
a
similar
tax
imposed
by
the
state
of
illinois
violated
both
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
also
created
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
our
ruling
today
has
two
parts.
first,
we
observe
that
our
due
process
jurisprudence
has
evolved
substantially
over
the
last
25
years.
we
conclude
that
under
the
governing
principles
of
that
body
of
law,
a
mail-order
house
like
quill
has
the
necessary
minimum
contact
with
north
dakota
that
are
of
constitutional
prerequisite
to
that
state's
taxing
jurisdiction.
we,
therefore,
overrule
that
part
of
the
holding
in
the
bellas
hess
case
and
hold
that
the
statute
does
not
violate
the
due
process
clause.
on
the
other
hand,
the
second
part
of
our
opinion
concludes
that
the
commerce
clause
holding
of
bellas
hess
remains
good
law.
although
we
have
addressed
related
issues
on
many
occasions,
we
have
never
rejected
the
principle
that
a
vendor
whose
only
connection
was
customers
in
the
taxing
state
is
by
common
carrier
or
the
united
states
mails
lacks
a
substantial
nexus
with
the
taxing
state
required
by
the
commerce
clause.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
is
reversed.
our
ruling
today,
however,
makes
entirely
clear
that
congress
retains
the
ultimate
power
to
address
and
resolve
the
complex
issues
surrounding
the
taxation
of
mail-order
businesses.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justices
kennedy
and
thomas
have
joined;
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
