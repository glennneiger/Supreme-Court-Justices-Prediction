justice
blackmun
was
the...
in
the
opinion
in
complete
auto,
was
national
bellas
hess
cited?
justice
blackmun
provided
it's
not
on
due
process.
if
it's
on
the
commerce
clause,
congress
can
do
that.
justice
blackmun
that's
why
i
share
the
two
justice's
comments
that
we're
a
little
concerned
that
you're
putting
it
on
both
pins.
justice
blackmun
are
you
asking
that
bellas
hess
be
overruled?
justice
blackmun
of
course,
of
the
present
members
of
the
court,
i
think
only
justice
white
was
here
at
the
time,
and
he
was
a
member
of
the
majority.
justice
blackmun
is
it
correct,
general
spaeth,
that
as
the
record
seems
to
disclose,
quill
is
only
the
number
6
in
north
dakota?
justice
blackmun
who
are
the
other
five?
i
thought
this
was
a
big
operator.
why
did
you
pick
on
quill?
