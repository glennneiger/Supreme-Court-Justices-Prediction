mr.
nicholas
spaeth
chief
justice
rehnquist,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
suppose
i
ought
to
begin
with
a
disclaimer.
this
is
not
a
buffalo
bills
tie.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
should
abandon
the
physical
presence
test
set
out
in
its
25-year-old
decision
of
national
bellas
hess
in
favor
a
standard
that
focuses
on
the
economic
realities
of
direct
marketing
sales
transaction.
this
case--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--yes,
i
am,
justice
blackmun.
this
case
arose
when
north
dakota
sued
quill
when
it
refused
to
collect
our
use
tax.
quill,
of
course--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--exactly,
and
that's
why
i
wore
this
tie
today.
as
you
can
see,
i'm
going
to
use
everything
i
can
to
sway
that
last
vote.
it
is
a
colorado
buffalo.
and
as
you
surmised,
our--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--if
you
give
me
a
minute,
justice
kennedy,
i'll
think
of
some.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
quill
does
have
some
small
economic
presence
in
the
state.
as
we
argue
in
our
brief,
they
maintain
ownership
interest
in
software
that
their
customers
use.
we
also
believe
they
own
these
catalogues
that
they
ship
unsolicited
into
our
state
to
thousands
of
people.
but
the
fact
that
this
case
could
turn
on
things
that
small
suggests
to
me
the
absurdity
of
the
physical
presence
test,
and
that's
why
we're
asking
this
court
today
to
overrule
national
bellas
hess
in
favor
of
a
standard
that
takes
into
account
the
economic
realities
of
selling
today.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
it
might.
and
obviously
i
can't
speak
for
all
the
states
on
this.
and
it
would,
of
course,
depend--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--it
could
be.
and
of
course
it
depends
on
how
the
states,
and
this
court
ultimately,
because
i
suspect
it
would
come
back
here,
would
apply
chevron
and
jim
beam,
and
in
a
way
to
determine--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--yes.
and
we're
quite
pleased
with
the
handwriting
so
far.
[laughter]
but
the
retroactivity
issue,
of
course,
is
not
in
front
of
you.
this
case
arose
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
we
have
not
assessed
quill
for
anything
at
this
point
in
time.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that's
the
problem--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--the
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
is,
as
this
court
well
knows,
ill
suited
the
weigh
the
complexities
of
this
decision.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
but
every
time
this
issue
has
been
presented
to
congress
it's
been
stalemated...
in
no
small
part
because
the
direct
marketing
association
has
argued
bellas
hess
is
a
due
process
case.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
i
was
speaking
about
the
political
realities,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
there
are
so
many
special
interest
groups
involved
in
this.
and
that...
in
a
situation
where
there's
a
lot
of
money
at
stake
for
congress--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--that's
right.
but
the
problem
is
not
congress.
the
problem
is
this
court
and
a
25-year-old
decision,
which
the
direct
marketing
association
uses
today
to
tell
congress
that
it's
a
due
process
case
and
you
don't
have
the
power
to
change
the
result
through
legislation.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
well,
that
would
give
me
half
a
loaf,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
it's
better
than
none,
but
as
you
might
understand,
i'm
hoping
for
the
whole
loaf
here
today.
and
there's
been
a
lot
that's
happened
in
this
country
since
bellas
hess
was
decided.
there
was
a
$2.4
billion
market
in
direct
marketing
at
that
point
in
time.
it's
grown
to
as
much
$180
billion
today.
it's
as
much
as
25
percent
of
the
retail
market
in
america
today.
it
continues
to
grow
rapidly
at
about
15
percent
a
year.
i'm
sure
all
of
you
get
hundreds
of
catalogues
every
year,
and
some
of
you
probably
order
products
from
them.
it's
resulted
in
about
a
$3.1
billion
a
year
erosion
of
state
taxes.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
i
think
it
shows
you
what
big
5
or
6
percent
tax
advantage
does
as
well.
they
have
a
competitive
advantage
over
in-state
marketers.
they
have
a
competitive
advantage
over
their
other
competitors,
like
sears,
roebuck
and
montgomery
ward
that
do
collect
the
tax
in
spite
of
the
parade
of
horribles
of
difficulty
that
my
noble
opponent
has
said
about
collecting
this
tax.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
i
think
they
are
the
largest
direct
marketer
of
office
equipment
in
the
state.
we
started
going
against
spiegel,
but
they
gave
up.
and
so
then
we
went
after
quill.
and
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--yes,
they
agreed
to
do
it
after
we
went
after
them.
i
think
they
saw,
hopefully,
the
handwriting
on
the
wall.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
well,
in
all
due
deference,
justice
white,
i
think
you
were
flat
wrong
in
national
bellas
hess.
but
i
also
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
there's
been
a
lot
that's
happened
since
then
that
focuses,
or
that
changes
the
view
of
this
case
from
the
standpoint
of
collectibility.
you
can
now
buy
computer
software,
and
many
direct
marketers
use
it
right
now,
that
automatically
calculate
the
tax
and
add
it
on
to
a
bill.
that
software's
available.
it
takes
into
account
the
complexities
of
every
jurisdiction
in
the
country.
and
that's
what
other
national
marketers
are
using
today.
it's
not
expensive;
quill
could
easily
purchase
it.
this
case
is
not
about
the
complexities
of
collection,
it's
about
a
tax
advantage
that
they
enjoy
that
they
don't
want
to
give
up.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
we
don't
provide
them
anything.
first
of
all,
we
facilitate
the
transaction
for
them.
they
use
phone
lines
in
our
state;
they
use
our
roads
to
deliver
their
products.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
yes.
we
build
those
roads.
and
we
also
regulate
those
phone
lines.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
we
regulate
the
phone
lines.
we
provide
landfills
where
their
product
goes.
but
most
importantly,
we
provide
the
customer
base
for
them.
we're
not
asking
them
to
pay
the
tax,
you
understand,
we're
asking
them
to
collect
it
and
give
it
to
us.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
i
agree
with
you,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
it
was
directly
presented
in
that
case
and
rejected.
but
i
still
think
it's
the
right
argument.
it's
an
argument
that
focuses
on
the
economic
realities
of
sales
transactions
by
large
companies
like
quill.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
yes.
and
i
think
i
mentioned
it
briefly
before.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
direct
marketing
has
become
such
a
big
player
in
the
national
sales
market.
it
is,
depending
on
whose
estimates
you
use,
15
to
25
percent
of
total
retail
sales
in
this
country.
and
i
think
the
combination
of
the
changing
marketplace,
the
ease
of
communication
that
goes
on
that
facilitates
this,
and
the
fact
that
the
collection
burdens
have
gone
down
substantially
because
of
technological
developments,
make
the
world
a
very
different
place
in
1992
than
it
was
in
1967
when
bellas
hess
was
decided.
at
the
same
time,
the
law
has
changed.
this
court,
in
national...
in
the
complete
auto
transit
v.
brady
opened
the
door
to
the
taxation
of
interstate
commerce
as
long
as
it
met
the
four-factor
test.
the
same
year,
in
the
national
geographic
test...
case,
which
has
been
alluded
to
by
the
other
side,
this
court
severed
the
connection
between
the
tax
and
the
physical
presence.
in
that
case,
national
geographic
society
had
two
advertising
offices
in
the
state
of
california
where
they
solicited
advertising.
and
the
tax
at
issue
there
was
a
tax
on
their
direct
mail
sales
to
the
state
of
california
from
another
location.
and
this
court
said
it's
okay
because
of
those
two
offices,
even
though
there
was
no
connection
between
the
activities
in
those
two
offices
and
the
tax
that
was
levied.
by
severing
the
connection
between
the
transaction
and
the
tax,
all
of
the
economic
justification
for
the
physical
presence
test
has
been
lost,
as
i
think
any
economist
would
tell
you.
and
that's
why
we
need
a
new
standard
today,
a
standard
that
recognized
the
realities
of
the
american
marketplace
today.
and
that's
why
this
court
believes
it's
appropriate
for...
or
the
state
believes
it's
appropriate
for
this
court
to
adopt
something
like
the
standard
applied
in
ordinary
civil
jurisdiction.
when
a
state
purposely
avails
itself
of
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
north
dakota,
in
other
words,
it
markets
in
our
state
and
makes
sales,
it
ought
to
at
least
bear
the
responsibility
of
collecting
the
sales
tax
and
remitting
it
back
to
the
state.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
to
register
as
a
business?
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
yes,
we
could
do
that.
and
we
would
as
part
of
this.
we--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--yes,
we
would.
but
that
only
means
that
we
have
notice
of
them
and
we
send
them
reports
to
fill
out
on
the
use
tax.
it
doesn't
trigger
any
other
responsibilities
on
their
part,
simply
to
pay
the
use
tax.
you
know,
the
physical
presence
test
really
doesn't
make
any
sense
for
at
least
three
reasons.
as
i
mentioned
before,
it's
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
economic
realities--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--yes,
in
a
variety
ways.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
yeah.
let
me
give
you
an
example,
justice
white.
part
of
my
office
is
the
consumer
fraud
division
in
the
state.
we
don't
have
a
better
business
bureau.
we
have
jurisdiction
over
out-of-state
marketers
like
quill
all
the
time
on
consumer
fraud
claims.
in
fact,
30
percent
of
the
consumer--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--right.
thirty
percent
of
the
consumer
fraud
claims
that
come
into
my
office
are
from
out-of-state
marketers.
it
was
mentioned
before,
tort
law
would
enable
us
to
reach
them
if
there
were
a
defective
product.
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
already
in
which
we
have
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
them.
and
so
this
case
would
not
be
a
major
development
in
the
sense
of
due
process
considerations.
we
already
have
jurisdiction
over
them.
the
question
is
do
we
have
jurisdiction
to
require
them
to
collect
an
remit
a
tax
to
us.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
since
1987.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
well,
that's
not
my
decision,
but
there's
a
possibility.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
yeah,
there's
a
theoretical--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--from
quill.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that's
correct.
because
when...
quill
had
notice
as
of
that
date
that
it
had
this
responsibility.
and
of
course,
it
chose
to
litigate.
and
perhaps
if
i'd
been
advising
them
as
their
counsel,
i
would
have
said
the
same.
but
the
tax
department
will
make
a
decision,
i
suppose,
on
the
retroactivity
issue
and
how
far
to
go
back--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--if
we
knew
who
they
were.
i
mean,
as
this
court
noted
in
national
geographic,
it's
virtually
impossible
for
the
state
to
audit
consumers.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
us
to
go
to
all
the
direct
marketing
companies
that
market
in
the
state
and
try
to
figure
out
if
they
made
sales
in
the
state
of
north
dakota.
and
i
think
this
argument's
been
presented
to
this
court
before.
in
national
geographic
it
was,
and
this
court
said
states
don't
have
to
do
that.
that's
impractical.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
he
mentioned
one
state,
maine,
and
i
can
explain
that
in
two
words:
l.l.
bean.
i
mean,
they're
a
big
player
in
the
state
of
maine.
as
you
notice,
the
state
of
maine
is
not
siding
with
the
other
states
in
this
particular
case
because
of
the
importance
of
l.l.
bean
to
that
state.
i
don't
think
we
need
to
do
that
constitutionally.
there's
a
much
easier
way,
and
that's
to
require
companies
like
quill
to
collect
and
remit
the
tax.
the
physical
presence
test
makes
no
sense
whatsoever.
as
justice
scalia
eloquently
put,
what's
the
difference
between
the
drummer
going
through
the
state
and
soliciting
sales
by
mail?
there
isn't
any
economic
distinction
between
those
two.
when
in
fact,
what's
happened,
is
it's
given
direct
marketers
a
huge
competitive
advantage
in
the
state.
they
have
the
advantage
that
they
don't
have
to
collect
the
tax.
what
bellas
hess
did
was
turn
the
commerce
clause
on
its
head.
instead
of
leveling
the
playing
field,
it's
given
out-of-state
marketers
a
competitive
disadvantage...
advantage
over
other
marketers.
finally,
it's
made
it
profitable
for
companies
to
avoid
the
tax
by
setting
up
subsidiaries.
that's
how
saks
fifth
avenue
does
it.
they
have
stores
and
they
have
direct
mail.
they
have
a
subsidiary
that
does
the
direct
mail
so
that
they
don't
have
to
collect
the
sales
tax,
or
use
tax,
in
the
states
where
they
actually
have
stores.
that
kind
of
thing
doesn't
make
any
sense.
so
i
urge
this
court
to
the
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
below
to
close
that
enormous
tax
loophole
that
exists.
it's
unjustified
by
economic
circumstances.
i
think
the
apportionment
and
nondiscrimination
requirements
of
complete
auto
will
be
met,
will
ensure
that
the
collection
of
the
tax
doesn't
violate
any
commerce
clause
considerations,
and
due
process
will
be
satisfied
by
forcing
the
seller
to
collect
the
tax,
only
when
it
purposely
avails
itself
of
the
privilege
of
doing
business
in
the
state.
mr.
gaggini
mentioned
the
fact
that
north
dakota
doesn't
tie
this
tax
to
its
sales.
well,
of
course
it
does.
they
don't
have
collect
the
tax
unless
they
make
a
sale.
it's
clearly
tied
to
sales
within
north
dakota.
i
urge
this
court,
therefore,
in
closing,
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
north
dakota
supreme
court,
which
i
think
was
a
finely
reasoned
decision.
thank
you.
