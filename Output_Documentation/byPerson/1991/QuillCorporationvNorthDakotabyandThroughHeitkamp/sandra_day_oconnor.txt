justice
o'connor
well,
that's
exactly
the
point,
that
is
we're
forced
to
address
here,
whether
that
physical
presence
requirement
should
exist
anymore
after
complete
auto
and
the
cases
following
it.
justice
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
you
might
want
to
rest
your
argument
just
on
the
commerce
clause
and
say
it
is
better
left
to
congress
to
change.
i'm
a
little
surprised,
as
is
justice
kennedy,
to
hear
your
argument.
justice
o'connor
counsel,
refresh
my
recollection.
how
many
of
the
states
have
passed
legislation
that
if
national
bellas
hess
were
to
be
reversed,
would
mandate
retroactive
application
of
state
tax
laws
to
situations
that
had
been
previously
exempt
under
national
bellas
hess?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
many
states?
about
36?
justice
o'connor
thirty-two.
justice
o'connor
and
if
we
were
to
overrule
national
bellas
hess
all
those
things
would
have
kicked
in
for
several
years
back,
i
assume.
justice
o'connor
would
that
involve
potential
retroactive
liability
covering
several
years
and
in
a
large
number
of
the
states,
general
spaeth?
justice
o'connor
it
would
be
a
very
substantial
in
amount,
would
it
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
you've
seen
the
handwriting
on
the
wall
there?
justice
o'connor
of
course
it
bears
on
it
in
this
way:
if
national
bellas
hess
rests
on
the...
dormant
commerce
clause,
certainly
congress
can
take
care
of
this
problem,
and
it
could
rightfully
weigh
the
really
massive
concerns
here
for
retroactive
liability
and
try
to
sort
it
out
in
a
fair
and
reasonable
way.
justice
o'connor
now,
that's
not
going
to
happen
if
this
court
decides
to
jump
the
gun
and
turn
the
tide.
justice
o'connor
they're
much
better
suited
to
do
than
we
are
because
they
can
deal
with
the
retroactivity
problem.
