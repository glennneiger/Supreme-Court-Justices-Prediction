chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-194,
the
quill
corporation
v.
north
dakota.
mr.
gaggini,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
might
go
beyond
that,
mr.
gaggini,
rather
than
just
saying
the
merits
were
rightly
decided.
this,
unlike
a
lot
of
our
constitutional
decisions,
bellas
hess
is
a
decision
which
congress
can
overrule,
the
same
way
it
provided
in
the
case
we
heard
argued
earlier.
congress...
if
congress
wants
to
change
the
result
in
bellas
hess,
it
can
do
so,
and
it's
been
asked
to
do
so
by
the
state.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gaggini.
general
spaeth,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
congress
is
ill
suited
to
do
it,
just
because
it
doesn't
pass
the
law
that
you
want.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
we
were
to
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
here,
say
that
bellas
hess
is
still
good
law,
but
that
was
based
on
the
commerce
clause,
not
the
due
process
clause,
would
that
solve
some
of
your
problems?
chief
justice
rehnquist
better
than
none.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
the
argument
that
was
rejected
in
bellas
hess
after
being
quite
eloquently
portrayed
by
the
dissent.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
general
spaeth.
mr.
gaggini,
you
have
3
minutes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gaggini.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
