justice
kennedy
is
that
on
the
assumption
that
there's
a
due
process
component
to
bellas
hess?
justice
kennedy
suppose
we
were
to
conclude
that
our
reading
of
bellas
hess
is
that
it's
simply
a
commerce
clause
case.
from
that,
then,
we
simply
have
an
allocation
problem,
don't
we,
and
the
parade
of
horribles
that
you
present
to
us
is--
justice
kennedy
--i'm
just
saying
suppose
we
disagree
with
that?
justice
kennedy
you're
saying
then
that
if
we
find
that
there
is
no
due
process
component,
at
least
no
viable
due
process
component,
then
we
must
overrule
national
bellas
hess.
justice
kennedy
well,
if
you
want
to
argue
the
case
on
the
theory
that
bellas
hess
must
rest
on
a
due
process
analysis--
justice
kennedy
--i
suppose
that
that's
your
choice.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
our
due
process
jurisprudence
has
progressed
to
the
point
where
it's
very
clear
that
your
clients
could
be
held
liable
for
products,
liability,
et
cetera,
and
that
if
bellas
hess
rested
on
due
process
at
one
point...
if
it
did,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it
did...
that
that
has
been
superseded
by
our
jurisprudence.
justice
kennedy
if
you
want
to
say
that
bellas
hess
then
must
be
overruled,
i
suppose
you're
at
liberty
to
argue
that.
justice
kennedy
well,
what's
the
reason
for
the
nexus
requirement
under
the
commerce
clause?
is
it
to
prevent
discrimination
against
out-of-state
companies?
justice
kennedy
and
would
you
say
that
they're
part
of
a
local
market?
it
seems
to
me
that
your
national
market
argument
works
against
you.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
statute
vindicates
the
idea
that
there's
a
national
market,
which
takes
many
forms,
which
has
many
sorts
of
structures,
but
that
all
should
be
treated
the
same.
so
that
the
l.s.
bean
company,
or
whatever
it's
called,
can
pay
a
sales
tax,
just
as...
or
use
tax,
just
as
a
company
does
if
it
has
small
warehouse
within
the
state.
it
seems
to
me
that
they're
quite
the
same.
they're
all
part
of
a
single
national
market.
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
sure
they
are.
but
maybe
we
were
wrong
in
1967.
is
there
some
reason
why
we
would...
should
be
more
reluctant
to
change
in
this
case
than
we
ordinarily
would
be,
or
less
reluctant?
what
kind
of
a
case...
this
is...
was
a
constitutional
decision,
right?
and
we
have
opinions
that
say
that
ordinarily
where
we
think
we've
gotten
it
wrong
there
and
are
wrongly
preventing
the
states
here
from
doing
something
they
ought
to
be
able
to
do
that
we
should
'fess
up
and
change
our...
change
our
opinion.
justice
kennedy
do
you
have
any
better
reasons?
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
have
there
been
any
other
changes
in
the
national
market?
you
mentioned
computerized
ability
to
calculate
the
tax.
have
there
been
any
changes
in
the
nature
of
the
market
itself?
