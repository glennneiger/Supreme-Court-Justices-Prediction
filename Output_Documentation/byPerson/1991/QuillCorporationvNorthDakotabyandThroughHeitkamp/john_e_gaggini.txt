mr.
john
e.
gaggini
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
north
dakota's
refusal
to
apply
this
court's
decision
in
bellas
hess.
by
that
refusal,
north
dakota
is
asking
this
court
first
to
abrogate
the
historic
standard
for
state
taxation
which
has
resulted
in
an
orderly
growth
of
an
open
national
economy,
and
second,
to
ignore
stare
decisis
and
overrule
a
construction
of
the
commerce
clause
that
is
based
on
50
years
of
case
law.
the
irony
of
this
case
is
that
while
the
european
community
is
eliminating
locally
erected
tax
barriers
in
order
to
complete
the
creation
of
a
european
common
market,
north
dakota
and
other
states
are
advocating
a
balkanization
of
the
american
market.
overruling
bellas
hess
will
destroy
the
interstate
marketplace
that
we
now
know
it.
quill
is
a
mail-order
company.
it
sells
more
than
9,000
office
supply
items
ranging
from
paper
clips
to
computer
accessories.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
your
honor,
we
would
not
before
this
court.
quill
conducts
its
business
exclusively
by
mail,
telephone--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--no,
the
balkanization
occurs
because
north
dakota
and
other
states
are
suggesting
to
this
court
that
national
bellas
hess
is
no
longer
the
jurisprudence
to
determine
what
is
subject
to
tax.
under
national
bellas
hess,
this
court
in
1966--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--yes,
sir.
well,
mail
order
houses
and
any
business
that
conducts
an
interstate
market
that's
not
covered
by
a
statute
such
as
you've
just
heard
86272.
in
a
service
industry,
an
accountant,
an
architect,
communicating
with
a
customer
by
telephone
or
mail
in
another
jurisdiction
is
not
covered
by
86272.
new
mexico,
in
briefs
filed
in
this
case,
would
suggest
they
might
be
able
to
tax
that
activity.
new
mexico
files
a
brief
in
this
case
supporting
a
gross
receipts
tax.
new
mexico
suggests
that
they're
not
bound
by
national
bellas
hess.
it's
no
longer
a
legitimate
authority.
so
the
panorama
of
this
case
is
much
more
than
the
direct
mail
order
or
market
industry,
and
it's
much
more
than
merely
collecting
taxes.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
bellas
hess,
justice
kennedy,
involves
two
aspects,
commerce
and
due
process.
and
we
submit
that
this
court
weighed
those
tests
in
1967,
when
justice
stewart
for
the
majority
and
justice
fortas
for
the
dissenting,
looked
at
the
illinois
market.
the
illinois
market
at
that
time
was
a
target,
a
market
that
national
bellas
hess
was
aiming
at.
it
was
sending
its
mail
catalogues;
it
was
sending
its
merchandise.
and
this
majority
said
that
looking
at
prior
case
law
dating
back
to
1940,
the
sears
case,
that
this
court
has
never
imposed
tax
obligations
on
an
out-of-state
vendor
unless
that
vendor
conducted
in-state
business
activity.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
justice
kennedy,
i
would
submit
that
under
this
court's
analysis
in
national
bellas
hess,
complete
auto,
national
geographic,
and
every
case
preceding
and
succeeding,
that
there
is
both
a
commerce
and
due
process
nexus
question.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
your
honor,
you
would
have
to
overturn
national
bellas
hess.
national
bellas
hess
requires
as
the
first
component
that
there
be--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--your
honor,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
commerce
clause
and
the
due
process
component...
when
we
speak
of
due
process,
there
are
two
aspects.
there's
the
state's
view
of
due
process,
which
is
personam
jurisdiction,
and
there
is
this
court's
application
of
due
process
in
the
tax
area.
both
standards
are
different.
but
i'm
suggesting
to
you,
your
honor,
that
the
commerce
clause
aspect
of
this
case
in
complete
auto
requires
the
first
analysis
to...
the
first
finding
to
be
that
there
be
a
substantial
nexus
in
the
taxing
forum.
this
court
has
never
held
otherwise.
we
can
go
back
to
1940
with
sears,
your
honor,
and
in
the
sears
analysis,
the
court
specifically
said
that
there
was
no
way
to
impose
the
obligation
on
the
foreign
business
that
didn't
have
a
presence.
that
was
repeated
in
national
geographic
1
month
after
complete
auto.
complete
auto
held
the
first
part...
the
first
component
of
the
four-part
commerce
test
to
require
a
substantial
nexus.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
i'm
arguing--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--i
may
have
been
misunderstood.
i
am
suggesting
to
this
court
that
national
bellas
hess
relies
on
commerce
clause
concerns.
and
commerce
clause
concerns
require
a
finding
of
substantial
nexus,
a
physical
presence,
in
the
taxing
forum.
that
has
been
consistently
applied
in
every
case
this
court
has
decided.
from
1941
until
this
court
decided
goldberg,
it
required
a
finding
of
substantial
nexus
for
commerce
clause.
and
that's
what
i
am
suggesting
to
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
yes,
your
honor.
and
may
i
suggest
that
the
state
in
this
case--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--your
honor,
again,
i
must
be
misspeaking
because
i
am
suggesting
to
you
that
bellas
hess
relies
on
the
commerce.
it...
there
are
due
process
underpinnings
in
that
case,
but
we're
saying
based
on
the
commerce
clause,
north
dakota
may
not
impose
these
tax
obligations
on
quill
because
quill
has
no
physical
presence
in
north
dakota.
national
bellas
hess
doesn't
stand
alone.
this
court
has
used
national
bellas
hess
in
complete
auto.
the
state
suggests
that
complete
auto
overturns
bellas
hess...
15
years
after...
that
bellas
hess
has
been
overturned
for
15
years.
complete
auto
applied
a
mississippi
gross
receipts
tax
to
a
business
that
was
conducted
exclusively
in
mississippi.
complete
auto
received
automobiles
in
mississippi
at
its
facilities.
those
automobiles
were
moved
by
complete
auto's
personnel
to
dealers
in
mississippi,
and
this
court
held
that
there
must
be
a
substantial
nexus
with
that
activity.
there
was
no
question
that
that
activity
occurred
in
mississippi
and
that
complete
auto
had
that
nexus.
the
state
suggests
that
this
court
has
abandoned
the
physical
presence
test
and
applied
a
due
process
test
in
determining
nexus.
that
due
process
test
they
they're
suggesting
is
a
burger
king
analysis,
which...
which
suggests
minimum
contact.
there's
no
authority
that
the
state
can
point
to
for
that
argument.
one
month
after
complete
auto
was
decided,
this
court
juxtaposed,
hand
in
hand,
bellas
hess
and
complete
auto
in
answering
the
question
in
national
geographic.
the
question
in
national
geographic
was
was
that
entity
taxable
in
the
state.
the
california
supreme
court
suggested
that
the
slightest
presence
rule
would
create
a
nexus.
and
this
court,
the
national
geographic
court,
looked
at
that
and
refused
to
adopt
that
analysis,
suggesting
that
national
geographic's
presence
in
the
state
was
sufficient.
and
in
that
opinion,
this
court
said
there
are
entities,
direct
marketers,
that
do
not
have
the
requirement
to
file
returns
or
pay
tax.
those
are
those
that
have
no
nexus...
analyzing
national
bellas
hess
1
month
after
complete
auto
was
decided.
the--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--no,
your
honor.
the
nexus
question
wasn't
at
issue.
and
that's
the...
that's
the
problem
of
the
state's
analysis
in
this
case.
they're
citing
cases
where
the
nexus
issue
wasn't
a
concern.
if
you
go
back
to
the
cases
where
nexus
was
involved,
and
we
might
start
just
looking
at
what
was
argued
in
national
bellas
hess.
in
national
bellas
hess,
the
state
of
illinois
in
response
to
justice
harlan's
question,
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
rule,
a
rule
that
businessmen
can
understand.
the
state,
attorney
general
mccarthy
arguing
for
illinois
suggested,
oh,
definitely,
i
think
there
should
be
some
kind
of
rule
they
should
understand.
and
that
rule,
i
suggest,
should
be
distilled
from
the
cases
of
this
court
is
a
rule
which
businessmen
should
well
understand.
and
that
is
simply
where
a
business
is
successful
in
a
state
from
a
business
point
of
view,
that
should
be
equated
with
presence
from
a
legal
point
of
view.
that
was
justice
fortas'
analysis.
that
was
the
state
of
illinois'
argument.
that
was
the
presentation
that
any
sale,
any
economic
activity
in
illinois
would
be
sufficient.
justice
fortas,
in
a
very
eloquent
dissent,
went
through
an
analysis
of
the
benefits
that
illinois
provided
to
bellas
hess,
a
missouri
company.
this
court
can
juxtapose
the
recitation
of
those
benefits
against
the
benefits
suggested
by
the
state
in
this
case.
they're
virtually
identical.
those
benefits
have
never
changed.
the
rules,
the
education
of
the
consumer,
that
still
exists,
but
this
court
analyzed
that.
there
were
three
dissenters:
justice
fortas,
black...
justices
black,
and
justice
douglas.
and
the
dissenters
argued
that
national
bellas
hess
should
be
required
to
collect
the
illinois
tax.
but
the
majority
suggested
that,
in
analyzing
prior
precedent,
no
case
ever
supported
that
argument.
yes,
there's
a
market,
yes,
there's
a
target,
and
people
can
shoot
at
that
target,
but
if
you
shoot
at
it
using
communication...
telephone,
u.s.
mail,
common
carrier...
that
the
shooting
at
that
target
is
insufficient
to
create
a
nexus.
that's
a
commerce
clause
analysis.
that's
not
a
due
process
clause
analysis
in
the
context
of
burger
king
or
international
shoe.
international
shoe,
at
that
time,
was
a
service
of
process
case.
the
question,
an
out-of-state
company,
who...
which
had
employees
in
the
state,
could
that
company
be
served.
the
question...
the
underlying
question
in
that
case
was
tax.
it
was
an
unemployment
tax.
this
court
previously
held
that
unemployment
taxes
were
not
commerce
clause,
were
not
protected
by
commerce
clause.
and
this
court
held
that
in
a
service
of
process
case,
that
international
shoe
could
be
served.
i'm
suggesting
to
your
honors
that
in
1945,
international
shoe
was
decided.
in
subsequent
years,
mcgee
was
decided,
which
was
an
insurance
company
issue,
no
commerce
clause
question.
mcgee
sold
a
contract
to
an
insured
in
california.
california
served,
by
mail,
that
insurance
company
which
brought
that
company
into
the
state.
the
state
of
illinois
argued
to
this
court
that
the
standard
adopted
by
this
court
in
mcgee
should
be
used
to
support
taxation
of
bellas
hess.
this
court
never
applied
that
standard.
that
was
an
in
personam,
personal
jurisdiction
test.
justice
douglas,
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
travelers,
suggested
that
there
may
be
different
levels
of
due
process.
your
honors,
i'm
not
arguing
due
process
in
this
case.
i
will
not
suggest
to
this
court
that
quill
could
not
be
served
if
there
was
a
tort
or
personal
injury
problem
in
quill...
in
the
state
of
north
dakota.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
there
is
a
different
standard
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
it's
not
only
for
discrimination,
your
honor,
it's
for
the
national
marketplace.
if
each
state
could
impose
restrictions
on
trading
with
customers
in
that
state,
we
wouldn't
have
the
national
market
that
we
currently
have.
this
court
has
analyzed
that,
the
openness
of
the
national
market...
has
applied
that
test.
it's
the
two
different--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--no,
sir.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--oh,
your
honor,
i
suggest
otherwise.
the
briefs
of
filed...
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
case
at
this
time,
states
are
not
imposing
tax
liabilities
as
a
result
of
the
commerce
clause
in
bellas
hess
in
all
of
these
service
industries
where
their
communication
is
by
mail
or
by
telephone
or
common
carrier.
this
concept
of
a
national
market
exists
for
all
of
that.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
the
founders'
vision?
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
no,
no.
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i'm
suggesting
the
ability
of
out-of-state
vendors
to
communicate
with
customers
in
a
state
without
being
burdened
by
the
various
burdens
of
tax
compliance.
your
honor,
we
talk
about
the
burdens
in
this
case,
and
they're
talked
about
in
a
very
amorphous
concept,
as
if
all
that
needed
to
be
done
is
an
amount
added
to
the
bottom
of
an
invoice.
but
your
honor,
there
are
6,500
taxing
jurisdictions.
it's
not
disputed.
the
acir
report,
the
advisory
commission
of
intergovernmental
relations,
suggests
that
there
are
over
6,000
taxing
jurisdictions.
if
we
look
at
the
number
of
tax
returns
that
have
to
be
filed,
we're
talking
about
over
5,000
tax
returns.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
say
that's
okay.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
i'm
not
saying
that's
okay.
i'm
saying
this
court
in
1967,
justice
stewart
and
the
majority
said
that
looking
at
this
national
market,
looking
at
the
target,
the
market
of
illinois,
that
illinois
could
not
impose
extraterritorial
burdens
on
the
out-of-state
vendor.
this
court
said
that
in
1967.
that
decision
has
be
followed
by
70
state
court
decisions,
by
this
court
as
citing
national
bellas
hess
in
six
other
decisions.
the
law
drawn
in
1967
was
physical
presence
was
necessary.
this
court's
exact
words
were:
we
have
never
imposed
a
tax
obligation
on
a
vendor
who
has
communicated
only
by
common
carrier,
mail,
and
electronics.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
the...
the
physical
presence
that...
this
court
has
drawn
the
mark--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--the--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--the
benefit--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--oh,
your
honor,
the
presence
of
a
drummer,
the
warehouse,
the
retail
outlet
in
the
state,
the
out-of-state
vendor
is
now
in
state.
it's
no
longer
an
out-of-state
vendor.
it's
an
in-state
vendor
receiving
benefits
from
the
state.
this
court
has
clearly
held
that
in
tyler
pipeline,
for
example,
where
a
full-time
employee.
we
have
no
question
that
if
there
was
a
physical
presence.
but
this
court
drew
the
line,
it
weighed
the
test
in
'67.
and
it
said
the
physical
presence
test
was
the
rule.
the
rule
can
be
justified
based
on
the
benefits
received
with
that
physical
presence.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
oh,
but
i
think,
your
honor,
that
when
you
juxtapose
the
benefits
derived
from
the
vendor
in
the
state,
those
are
clear
benefits.
there
is
no
benefit
that
is
directly
available
to
quill,
no
benefit
distinguishable
from
those
amorphous
benefits
identified
in
bellas
hess.
they're
offered
to
every
vendor
who
is
out
there
communicating.
and
by
the
way,
north
dakota
does
not
tie
it
to
an
economic
basis;
north
dakota
ties
it
to
three
communications,
three
advertisements.
no
sale.
three
advertisements
as
nexus.
we're
talking
about
burdens
here
about
local
taxes.
the
state's
brief
suggests
there's
no
tax
liability
for
local
jurisdictions.
that
brief
is
contrary
to
a
tax
commissioner
bulletin
issued
in
january
of
'91
which
says
there
is
local
taxes.
and,
your
honor,
one
other
aspect
of
this
about
discriminatory
burdens,
a
vendor
selling
into
the
state,
in
many
states
is
obligated
to
collect
at
the
point
of
destination,
where
the
local
retailer
is
only
obligated
to
collect
tax
based
on
the
point
of
sale.
that's
a
discriminatory
burden.
the
requirement
imposed
on
the
out-of-state
vendor
to
collect
in
a
disparate
number
of
jurisdictions,
the
ability
of
a
local
retailer
to
collect
over-the-counter
taxes
that
the
out-of-state
vendor
cannot
collect,
the
reporting
of
these
multiple
jurisdictions.
we're
speaking
of
not
6,500
returns
that
are
filed
monthly,
but
6,500
entries.
i
am
repeating
burdens
that
the
acir
report
and
congress
today
have
considered
and
said
are
indistinguishable
from
the
burdens
this
court
weighed
in
1967.
footnote
14
of
national
bellas
hess
is
a
footnote
where
this
court
looked
at
the
willis
report
and
identified...
which
identify
the
burdens.
if
you
juxtapose
that
willis
report
against
the
acir
report
and
congressional
hearings,
you
will
find
that
the
burdens
are
identical.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
would
agree
with
you
except
this
case
is
distinguishable.
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
based
on
the
jurisprudence,
bellas
hess
was
well
reasoned
in
1967.
there
may
be
a
dispute
as
to
which
way
the
court
should
have
gone,
but
it
was
well
reasoned.
it
provided
a
workable
framework,
a
framework
where
taxpayers,
state
administrators,
and
courts
have
followed
for
over
25
years.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
thank
you,
your
honor.
that
was
my
second
point,
that
bellas
hess--
[laughter]
that
bellas
hess--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--your
honor,--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--well,
i
am
not
suggesting
this
court
doesn't
retain
its
right
to
analyze
any
congressional
legislation.
but
i
have
deference
to
congress,
especially
the
considerations
they
have
given
to
this
case.
when
i
say
this
case,
i
don't
mean
to
quill,
i'm
talking
about
the
issue
of
bellas
hess.
the
states
have
petitioned
congress
a
few
years
ago,
hoping
to
elicit
a
change.
and
congress
looked
at
that
and
said...
initially
they
said,
well,
let's
go
with
an
origin
tax.
that
is,
the
state
from
which
the
sale
is
shipped
would
collect
the
revenue.
and
the
state
said
no,
we...
we're
not
too
pleased
with
that
because
then
the
tax
would
be
distributed
to
the
states
that
were
selling,
and
congress
went
into
a
destination
tax.
the
destination
tax
initially
proposed
just
said,
we're
going
to
allow
the
states
to
impose
this.
and
with
consideration
of
the
compliance
burdens,
et
cetera,
congress
came
in
and
started
drafting
a
provision
that
provided
for
uniform
rates,
limitation
on
returns,
the
limitation
on
audits.
congress
was
familiar
with
these
burdens
and
tried
to
tailor
legislation
that
would
eliminate
the
due
process
concerns.
if
congress
enacts
legislation,
i
am
confident
that
congress
will
enact
legislation
that
is
carefully
tailored
to
consider
due
process.
but
this
court
has
retained
jurisdiction
to
analyze
that.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
your
honor,
there
was
an
excellent
compilation
which
is
attached
to--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--thirty-two
states,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
thirty-two
have
adopted
legislation.
of
the
32...
and
again,
we
have
to
put
that
in
historical
perspective,
if
you're
interested.
that
legislation
didn't
come
about
because
the
law
changed,
it
came
about
first
because
congress
was
considering
legislation
and
they
wanted
to
be
lined
up.
if
congress
enacted
this,
they
wanted
to
be
behind
the
locomotive
pulling
out
so
that
they
had
effective--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--yes,
your
honor,
there...
there's
a
horrendous...
historical...
the
retroactive
liability
is
so
dramatic
in
this
case
because
it's
not
the
tax
liability
of
the
vendor
we're
talking
about.
we're
talking
about
the
consumer.
and
we
see
states
out
there
that
have
alternative
procedures
for
collecting.
and
they've
been
implementing
this.
first
of
all,
in
our
case,
quill
sells
to
businesses.
the
state
has
been
auditing
returns
filed
by
those
businesses.
but
instead
of
assuming
that
obligation
in
north
dakota,
they're
transporting
it
to
an
out-of-state
vendor.
it's
very
expedient.
maine
has
done
the
same...
has
initiated
a
procedure
for
consumers.
they
have
a
line
on
the
income
tax
return,
as
a
number
of
states
have,
and
there's
a
report
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
direct
marketing
association
in
this
case,
which
reports
the
success
that
maine
has
had.
so,
your
honor,
in
going
back
to
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked,
the
first
question
i
responded
to;
the
second
factor
chief
justice
rehnquist
took
my
thunder,
but
it
was
that
congress
may
correct
this
legislation
because
it's
a
commerce
clause
question,
and
they
can
correct
any
misapplication.
and
that
the
third
point
was
that
north
dakota
advances
no
compelling
reason.
many
other
states
have
alternative
methods
of
collecting.
and
i
will...
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
thank
you,
chief
justice.
just
some
quick
points.
first,
national
bellas
hess
was
larger
than
quill.
quill's
sales
into
north
dakota
were
one-half
when
measured
against
national
bellas
hess'
sales
in
'62.
if
we
adjust
by
inflation
bellas
hess'
sales,
they
were
nine
times
the
size
of
quill.
this
is
a
commerce
clause
case.
i
want
to
repeat.
it's
a
commerce
clause
case.
the
state
treated
it
as
a
commerce
clause
case,
we
treated
it
as
a
commerce
clause
case,
but
the
analyzed
it
under
due
process.
as
to
the
consumer
going
outside
the
state
to
buy
merchandise,
the
state
of
north
dakota
buys
merchandise
from
quill.
the
state
is
exempt
from
tax.
and
the
state
buys,
and
it's
in
our
brief.
it's
footnoted.
we
were
surprised.
it
came
up
in
a
newspaper
article.
due
process
adjudication,
the
indication
that
the
state
has
jurisdictional--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--it's
that
the
consumer's
decision,
and
there's
a
citation
to
the
congress
hearings,
justice
stevens,
that
the
consumer
doesn't
make
a
decision
necessarily
on
sales
and
use
tax
collection.
and
that
has
been
reported
to
congress.
and
i
wanted
to
emphasize
it.
the
only
reason
the
state
would
be
buying
from
us,
because
they
don't
pay
sales
tax,
is
because
either
of
a
variety
of
product
or
price.
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that's
not
a
decision
of
the
consumer.
may
i
just
wrap
a
few
points
about
adjudicatory
jurisdiction?
we
say
that
the
state
has
powers,
state
police
powers,
but
those
are
not
equated
with
tax
jurisdiction.
as
to
the
north...
as
to
the
validity
of
national
bellas
hess,
we
cite
to
the
north
dakota
legislation,
where
the
north
dakota
legislators
themselves
believed
national
bellas
hess
controlling
in
1987,
when
they
enacted
their
law,
and
they
petitioned
congress
to
change.
the
state's
audit
of
the
consumer...
this
is
not
a
consumer
question
in
this
case.
quill
sells
to
businesses
and
the
state
audits
those
businesses.
as
to
one
state,
it's...
your
honor,
we
cite
in
our
appendix,
there
are
16
states
that
have
alternative
methods
of
collecting
this
tax.
sears...
there's
been
mention
that
sears
collects
this
tax.
national
bellas
hess
applies
to
the
company
like
sears,
because
when
sears
sells
into
local
jurisdictions
where
they
don't
have
physical
presence,
they're
not
collecting.
the
sears-type
out-of-state
mail
order
houses
are
not
collecting
the
tax
in
the
local
jurisdictions
because
they
don't
have
nexus
in
those
jurisdictions.
physical--
mr.
john
e.
gaggini
--thank
you.
