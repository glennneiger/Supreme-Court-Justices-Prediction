justice
o'connor
mr.
klein,
i
think
that
our
cases
in
touche
ross
and
maybe
the
sierra
club
indicate
that
the
courts
won't
engraft
a
remedy
on
a
statute
that
congress
didn't
intent
to
provide.
do
you
think
that
notion
has
any
applicability
here?
justice
o'connor
you
think
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
scope
of
the
remedy?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
we
have
employed
that
notion
even
in
statutes
enacted
under
the
spending
clause?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
under
the
spending
clause
theory
we
were
a
little
more
careful
about
binding
a
damages
remedy
if
it
might
be
beyond
the
scope
of
what
we
assume
the
states
have
contracted
with
the
federal
government
to
do.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
faced
with
an
unintentional
violation,
so
to
speak?
can
there
be
an
unintentional
violation
of
title
ix?
