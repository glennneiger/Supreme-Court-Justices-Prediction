justice
scalia
mr.
klein,
couldn't
an
argument
be
made
that
this
isn't
covered
by
1983?
justice
scalia
have
we
held...
have
we
held
that
sex
discrimination
is
covered?
justice
scalia
i
see
what
you're
saying.
through
title
ix--
justice
scalia
where
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
scalia
does
it
have
the
text
of
the
statute?
does
the
text
of
the
statute--
justice
scalia
--so
when
you
say
that
congress
said,
you
mean
some
of
the
legislative
history
says
that?
justice
scalia
i
wish
you'd
make
the
distinction.
justice
scalia
some
of
us
think
there's
a
difference.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
mr.
pearson,
it
seems
to
me
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
a
topsy-turvy
implication
from
the
statute.
in
our
system
of
laws
monetary
damages
is
the
usual
relief.
it's
equitable
relief
that's
extraordinary.
you
always
have...
you
always
have
damages
and
the
issue
is
do
you
have
an
equitable
remedy
here.
you're
asking
us
to
just
overturn
a
long
historical
tradition
that
i
presume
congress
has
in
mind
when
it
legislates.
damages
are
the
normal
remedy.
you
argue
about
whether
you
have
any
equitable
remedy.
justice
scalia
it
isn't
that
you
wouldn't
have
a
cause
of
action,
it's
that
there
was...
there
was
a
defense.
it
wouldn't
lie.
but
you
had
a
cause
of
action
for
equitable--
justice
scalia
--and
is
this
an
immune
institution?
if
it's
an
immune
institution
you
wouldn't
have
any
problem.
justice
scalia
mr.
klein...
unless
they
had
teachers...
they
thought
that
most
of
the
discrimination
would
be
against
teachers
rather
than
students.
i
mean,
that's
one--
justice
scalia
--can
i
ask
you,
mr.
klein,
whether
any
of
the
subsequent
statutes
that
you
talk
about,
the
ones
following
title
ix,
you
cite
them
to
show
congress'
understanding
of...
they
imply
an
understanding
of
title
ix.
is
there
any
disposition
that
they
provide
for
which
would
be
altered
if
we
did
not
adopt
your
understanding
of
title
ix?
justice
scalia
so
if
we
should
change
and
provide
a
lesser
remedy
for
title
ix
we
would
also
produce
a
lesser
remedy
for
later
enacted
legislation?
