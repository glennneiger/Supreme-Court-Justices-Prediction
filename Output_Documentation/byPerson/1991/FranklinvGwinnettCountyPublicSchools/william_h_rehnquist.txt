chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
90-918,
christine
franklin
v.
gwinnett
county
public
schools
and
william
prescott.
mr.
klein.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
back
pay,
of
course,
is
not
the
equivalent
of
damages.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
see
how
you
draw
upon
a
case
which
allowed
back
pay
as
saying
that
therefore
damages
are
available,
unless
just
by
a
rather
distant
implication.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
was
guardians
that
you're
talking
about
now?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
draw
any
very
compelling
inference
from
guardians.
the
court
was
split
so
badly.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
other
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
she
have
to
show
too
that
there
was
a
policy
on
the
part
of
the
school
board
before
she
could
sue
the
school
board,
rather
than
individuals
who
she
claimed
discriminated
under
monell?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it's
a
criteria
you
would
not
have
to
meet
under
title
ix.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
if,
if
we
upheld
your
position
here,
people
who
had
previously
sued
under
1983
and
had
to
prove
a
policy
under
monell
would
be
relieved
of
that
obligation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
eleventh
amendment
has
never
applied
either
to
municipal
corporations
or
to
counties.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
we're
not
talking
about
a
state
here
and
we're
not
talking
about
a
state
in
the
typical
monell
situation.
states
aren't
sued
under
section
1983.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
klein,
was
the
language
of
section
1866...
rather
of
the
1866
civil
rights
act...
with
respect
to
remedies
the
same
as
the
language
of
title
ix?
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
why
does
one
bear
on
the
other?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
that
rule,
for
example,
stated
in
the
sullivan
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
klein.
mr.
pearson,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
pearson.
mr.
nightingale.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
then
that
the
language
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner
is
from
our
decision
in
bell
against
hood
is
limited
to
constitutional
violations?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
the
1986
act
you're
referring
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nightingale.
mr.
klein,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
klein.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-918,
franklin
versus
gwinnett
county
public
schools
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
