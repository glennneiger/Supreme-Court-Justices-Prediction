mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
view
of
the
case
is
that
the
law
as
it
stands
now
has
developed
through
the
sequence
of
cases,
cannon,
guardians,
and
darrone,
to
a
point
where
at
the
most
under
title
ix
and
similar
conditional
spending
power
statutes
the
relief
that
would
be
judicially
available
would
be
equitable
in
nature
and
nothing
beyond
that.
we
feel
that
this
line
between
equitable
and
traditional
damages
remedies
is
a
rational
stopping
point
in
the
development
of
the
law,
and
we
would
suggest
that
if...
within
the
context
of
this
case,
the
court
hold
that
nothing
more
than
equitable
relief
be
available
in
the
context
of
a
judicial
proceeding.
we
think
that
the
cases
of
this
court
state
the
criteria
for
determining
implied
cause
of
action,
and
we
argue
also
for
remedy
is
governed
by
congressional
intent.
and
under
that
method
of
analysis
our
view
is
no
reading
of
the
statute,
no
reading
of
the
cases
of
this
court
up
until
now,
particularly
under
conditional
spending
power
legislation,
would
authorize
anything
more
than
equitable
relief.
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
well,
as
far
as
equitable
relief
is
concerned
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
options
available
to
a
school
system.
internal
discipline
of
any
individuals
who
would
be
responsible--
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
--if
necessary.
let's
back
up.
it's
a
two-step
process.
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
well,
there
are
two
steps
to
the
process,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
both.
the
first
is
that
the
agency
responsible
for
enforcing
title
ix,
the
office
of
civil
rights,
was
called
into
the
process,
and
the
agency
in
the
statute
does
have
a
role
in
trying
to
achieve
voluntary
compliance.
that
language
is
used
in
the
statute
and
that
is
a
predicate
to
the
use
of
the
agency
remedy
of
funding
termination.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
lightly
disregard
what
the
agency
can
do
administratively.
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
yeah,
we
don't
question
that.
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
it
goes
back
to
the
agency
remedy,
is
that
the
conciliation
process
can
produce
internal
changes,
discipline,
restorative
measures,
restorative--
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
--it
is
because
it
moots
the
equity
point.
if
you
take
that
action
and
that
action
is
curative
and
restorative,
the
action
would
moot
a
claim
for
equitable
relief
and
render
unnecessary
going--
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
--well,
in
the
context
of
a
student
who
has
been
sexually
victimized
in
any
way
one
issue
is
whether,
as
a
result
of
the
misconduct,
she
has
been
fully
restored
to
the
educational
status
she
is
entitled
to
under
title
ix.
our
view
of
the
statute
is
that
the
federal
interests
vindicated
by
title
ix
go
to
protection
and
securing
of
the
status
of
the
student
in
the
educational
climate,
and
not
beyond
that.
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
no,
sir,
they're
not,
because
if
the--
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
--if
the
school
does
not
restore
her
to
a
status
that
she
would
have
enjoyed
but
for
the
discrimination,
then
she
can
go
into
court
and
say
they
have
acknowledged
misconduct
but
they
have
not
taken
enough
action
to
restore
me
to
my
pre-act
status,
and
then
can
ask
for
the
district
judge
to
give
additional
relief,
require
additional
corrective
measures
to
restore
the
student
to
the
pre-misconduct
status.
that's
the
focus
of
title
ix,
that's
the
focus
of
agency
oversight.
and
in
the
event
that
agency
oversight
doesn't
produce
sufficient
correctives,
cannon
allows
the
student
to
go
into
court
and
says...
say
ocr,
school
system,
they've
gotten
together,
they
haven't
done
enough,
i
disagree,
will
you
do
more.
that's
where
equitable
relief
does
survive.
but,
i
think
the
advantage
of
the
title
ix
compliance
mechanisms
is
that
you
have
some
way
of
resolving
the
issue
of
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
and
what
corrective
measures
need
to
be
taken,
and
can
obviate
the
necessity
of
litigation
if
you
can
find
the
remedy
to
equitable
relief.
bear
in
mind
that
if
you
have
a
damages
remedy
it's
never
moot.
voluntary
compliance
can
be
pursued
to
the
fullest
extent
possible,
but
that
doesn't
moot
the
damages
claim.
and
that's
the
differentiating
factor
between
the
kind
of
mechanism
that
we
have
under
title
ix,
and
the
kind
of
enforcement
mechanism
that
they
are
arguing
in
our
view
ought
to
be
engrafted
onto
title
ix.
in
some
cases
equitable
relief
will
be
unnecessary.
the--
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
--well,
there
is
none
needed,
but
steps
were
taken
that
were--
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
--not
at
this
point,
and
that
claim
was
dropped,
and
it
was
dropped
by
virtue
of
the
compliance
steps
taken
by
the
school
system,
which
were
the
result
of
the
extant
enforcement
mechanism.
so
we
see
the
interplay
between
agency
oversight
and
equitable
relief
to
be
a
complementary
enforcement
mechanism
quite
rational
in
the
way
in
which
it
operates.
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
no.
the
answer
is
we're
not
asking
for
an
inversion
of
the
law.
take
into
account
the
defendant
that
is
being
sued
in
this
case.
it
is
an
institutional
defendant,
a
governmental
entity,
and
historically,
since
ex
parte
young
all
the
way
up
until
the
time
monell
was
decided,
the
only
relief
that
could
be
judicially
obtained
against
governmental
entities
was
injunctive
in
nature.
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
well,
we're
not
disputing
the
existence
of
cause
of
action,
but
the
question
is
is
the
remedy
that
we're
talking
about
in
the
context
of
this
case
somehow
an
inversion
of
traditional,
established
legal
priorities,
and
the
answer
is
in
the
law,
by
virtue
of
the
longstanding
existence
of
the
law
of
immunities,
equitable
relief
was
in
fact
the
primary
exclusive
relief
against
immune
institutions,
both
state
by
virtue
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
governmental.
mr.
albert
m.
pearson,
iii
it
will...
it
may
be
immune
institution;
it
may
not
be.
there
is
an
argument
here
in
the
court
today
that
the
monell-type
standards
don't
apply,
and
i
assume
that
they
would
further
argue
that
the
reasoning
in
monell
ought
to
be
extended
to
title
ix
at
a
minimum.
now,
mr.
klein's
position
is
we
don't
want
monell-type
standards
at
all.
in
effect
what
he
wants
is
a
damage
action
against
the
institution
under
a
statute
which
provides
no
remedy
against
the
wrongdoers
as
individuals.
if
you're
talking
about
inverting
priorities
in
terms
of
morals,
at
least
1983
provides
a
remedy
directly
against
the
individual
wrongdoer,
and
there
is
a
special,
more
particularized
showing
that
has
to
be
made
in
order
to
impute
liability
up
to
the
institution.
i
think
the
inversion
comes
in
their
interpretation
of
title
ix
and
the
identity
of
the
defendant,
and
then
you
look
at
who
the
wrongdoer
is
directly.
and
that
would
be,
under
their
allegations
in
the
case,
the
individuals
who
were
involved
with
this
student.
so
i
would
disagree
with
you
in
the
suggestion
that
we're
inverting
classical
law
equity
relationship.
suits
against
governmental
entities
have
always
been
treated
differently
because
remedies
at
law
are
inadequate
and
therefore
equitable
relief
has
been
necessary.
ex
parte
young
fiction
was
the
origin
of
that
in
modern
litigation,
and
it
is
carried
all
the
way
forward
into
the
contemporary
era,
and
in
fact
lots
of
statutes
view
this,
i
would
assume,
as
being
such
a
strongly
held
principle
that
they
exempted
local
subdivisions
from
the
scope
of
their
laws.
title
vii,
for
example,
was...
did
not
cover
state
and
local
political
subdivisions
until
it
was
modified
in
1972.
so
we
feel
like
that
if
you
look
at
the
contemporary
context
within
which
title
ix
was
enacted
and
at
statutory
antecedent,
title
vi,
the
basic
law
was
no
damages
remedies
against
governmental
defendants.
the
structure
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
'64
is
totally
consistent
with
that
premise.
injunctive
relief...
where
legal
relief
is
available
under
that
statute,
every
title,
every
one,
nothing
more
than
equitable
relief.
every
title
deals
with
intentional
discrimination.
and
the
conjunction
of
title
vi
with
those
other
titles,
it
seems
to
me,
argues
powerfully
that
what
was
contemplated
under
title
vi
was
injunctive
relief,
and
the
law
that
was
being
assimilated
in
title
ix
was
injunctive
relief.
look
at
the
title
vi
litigation
between
1964
and
1972.
i
tried
to
cite
as
many
of
the
cases
as
i
could
find
in
my
appendix.
not
one
case
did
we
find
where
the
litigants
even
asked
for
any
remedy
other
than
injunctive
relief,
except
for
the
few
cases
that
drew
in
the
analogy
of
the
title
vi
equitable
relief
model.
and
some
of
these
cases
are
cases
where
the
1983
claim
was
a
parallel
claim,
where
you
have
a
damages
remedy.
nobody
asked
for
conventional
damages,
and
surely
nobody
asked
for
punitive
damages.
it
seems
to
me
when
you
look
at
these
kinds
of
factors
the
case
is
compelling
that
neither
title
vi,
title
ix,
or
any
similar
legislation
has
ever
contemplated
the
sort
of
damages
remedy.
we
ask,
then,
that
the
court
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
the
solicitor
general
has
time
allocated
in
this
case.
