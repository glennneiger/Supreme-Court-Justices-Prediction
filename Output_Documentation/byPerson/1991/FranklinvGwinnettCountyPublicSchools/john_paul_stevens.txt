justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
one
question?
nobody's
talked
about
the
facts
of
the
case
at
all,
and
i
understand
why
your
argument
might
have
a
lot
of
force
if
somebody
had
been
denied
admission
to
the
school
and
then
injunction
could
get
them
in
the
school
or
reinstatement
of
a
faculty
member,
but
what
kind
of...
what
equitable
relief
would
this
plaintiff
get?
justice
stevens
you
mean
this
student
should
bring
suit
or
to
get
an
order
against
a
discharged
employee
to
be
disciplined?
i
don't
understand--
justice
stevens
--what
in
this
particular
case,
what
kind
of
equitable
relief
could
possibly
justify
even
filing
the
lawsuit?
justice
stevens
no,
no,
i
understand,
but
my
question
is
devoted
to
a...
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
and
the...
i
gather
you
assume
there
is
an
implied
cause
of
action
in
the
case.
justice
stevens
and
what
is
the
possible,
even
theoretical
possible
remedy
that
the
individual
plaintiff
in
this
case
could
have
available
that
would
motivate
even
bringing
the
case?
i
understand
you're
saying--
justice
stevens
--but
that's
not
responsive
to
my
question.
justice
stevens
moot
what
claim
for
equitable...
what
is
the
claim
for
equitable
relief
that
she
could
ever
assert?
justice
stevens
but
those
are
arguments
for
saying
there's
no
need
for
a
private
cause
of
action.
justice
stevens
you
still
haven't
responded
to
my
question,
what
equitable
relief
she
could
get
if
she
has
a
cause
of
action.
justice
stevens
but
in
this
case
there
would
clearly
be
a
remedy
against
a
private
school
here,
wouldn't
there,
on
the
facts
of
this
case?
