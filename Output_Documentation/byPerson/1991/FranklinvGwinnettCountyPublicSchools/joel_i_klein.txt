mr.
joel
i.
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1972
congress
enacted
title
ix
to
give
all
individuals
a
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
on
the
ground
of
sex
by
educational
institutions
receiving
federal
funds.
in
1979
this
court
held
in
cannon
that
the
title
ix
right
is
judicially
enforceable
at
the
behest
of
an
individual
like
petitioner
whose
right
has
been
violated.
in
the
case
presented
today
the
question
is
whether
the
means
of
redressing
the
violation
of
this
legally
enforceable
right
include
the
normal
remedy
of
damages.
we
believe
damages
are
available
here
for
two
reasons.
first,
this
court's
consistent
rule
has
been
to
permit
all
traditional
judicial
remedies,
including
damages,
whenever
a
statute
contains
an
implied
right
of
action.
that's
a
perfectly
sensible
rule,
i
would
submit,
because
when
the
court
concludes,
as
it
did
in
cannon,
that
there
are
sufficient
indicia
of
congressional
intent
to
support
an
implied
right
of
action,
the
natural
inference,
and
indeed
the
only
plausible
rule,
is
that
the
courts
can
use
their
customary
remedial
powers.
second,
we
believe
that
a
direct
examination
of
congressional
intent
confirms
the
conclusion
that
damages
are
available
under
title
ix.
in
1972,
when
congress
expressly
patterned
title
ix
on
title
vi
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
title
vi
had
been
interpreted
by
the
lower
courts
to
include
an
implied
right
of
action,
and
this
court's
cases
at
that
time
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
an
implied
right
of
action
carries
with
it
a
right
to
pursue
damages.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
congress
can
properly
be
said
to
have
relied
on
these
subtle
principles
when
it
enacted
title
ix,
and
that
that
intent
should
be
given
effect
here.
furthermore,
after
cannon
was
decided
it
seems
that
this
view
of
congressional
intent
became
much
clearer,
as
congress
has
since
then
passed
two
statutes
relying
on
and
endorsing
its
understanding
that
damages
are
available.
there's
been
no
reason
given
to
suggest
why
these
long-settled
and
relied-on
expectations
should
now
be
disturbed.
i'd
like
to
return,
then,
to
the
general
rule
which
authorizes
damages
under
an
implied
right
of
action
unless
there
is
good
evidence
to
suggest
that
congress
intends
otherwise.
that
rule
has
been
consistently
applied
by
this
court
both
before
and
after
title
ix
was
passed,
including
well
into
the
era
when
the
court
tightened
up
its
criteria
for
implying
a
right
of
action
in
the
first
place.
in
particular,
in
1983
and
1984
the
court
applied
this
rule
in
the
guardians
and
darrone
cases
to
hold
that
a
back-pay
remedy
is
available
under
both
title
vi
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
and
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
the
principle
is
that
in
guardians
and
darrone
the
reason
back
pay
was
found
to
be
available
is
that
once
the
court
finds
an
implied
right
of
action
it
infers
the
availability
of
traditional
damages.
so
there
is
no
doubt
a
difference
in
remedy,
but
i
think
there
is
not
a
difference
in--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
i
think
it
is
by
implication
in
the
sense
that
i
think
the
reasoning
that
led
the
court
to
think...
to
conclude
rather...
that
damages...
that
back
pay
is
available,
that
same
reasoning
applies
here.
there
was,
for
example,
no
direct
legislative
intent
that
the
court
ruled
on
to
say
that
title
vi
would
include
back
pay.
i
mean,
there
was
no
specific
or
even
indirect
suggestion.
what
the
court
really
concluded
is
that
once
we
find
sufficient
indication
of
a
right
of
action
we
presume,
it's
just
a
natural
presumption,
that
all
the
remedies
are
available.
we
don't
pick
and
choose
among
them.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
this
is
guardians,
which
i
think
then
was--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
it
is
hard
to
draw
it
from
guardians
alone.
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
in--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--darrone.
the
consolidated
rail
v.
darrone,
which
was
the
year
after
guardians,
where
frankly
a
unanimous
court
basically
came
together,
i
think,
on
these
principles.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't
in
the
following
sense,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
touche
ross
and
its
progeny
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
court
won't
imply
a
right
of
action
unless
it
concludes
that
there
is
congressional
intent
to
do
so.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't,
for
the
following
reason.
if
we
agree
that
once
you
imply
a
private
right
of
action
that
must
mean
two
things.
one,
congress
intended
to
allow
a
judicially
enforceable
right.
that's
what
a
private
right,
i
think,
means.
it
also
must
mean
the
fact
that
it's
an
implied
right
is
that
congress
has
left
the
issue
to
the
courts,
because
they
haven't
set
it
out
in
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history.
now,
what
i
suggest,
if
you
knew
that
much,
which
is
i
think
what
you
know
in
an
implied
right
of
action
case,
the
logical
inference
is
that
all
remedies
are
going
to
be
available.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
do,
because
i
think
that
notion
explains
the
guardians,
darrone
cases,
which
is
a
spending
clause
statute.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
you
have,
but
i
think
that
distinction
was
drawn
actually
by
justice
white
in
his
opinion
in
guardians.
the
point
he
made,
i
think--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--it
was
actually
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
believe
so,
sir.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
the
point
that
justice
white
made,
which
it
seems
to
me
is
a
fair
point,
that
if
you're
talking
about
an
imply...
a
damages
remedy
in
a
context
where
it's
an
unintentional
violation,
it's
difficult,
the
pennhurst
concern
about
contractual
understandings
is
appropriate.
now,
in
fact
we
allege,
and
i
understand
we
have
to
prove
an
intentional
violation.
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
make,
justice
o'connor,
is
it
at
least
seems
strange
to
me
the
notion
that
when
congress
provides
federal
funds
to
a
program
it
would
want
a
less
vigorous
or
less
comprehensive
scheme
of
enforcement
with
respect
to
civil
rights.
i
think
in
fact
we
ought
to
basically
think
that
it
would
be
opposite
where
federal
monies
may
be
misused.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
of
title
ix?
well,
i
think
that
is
a
question
that
certainly
is
left
open
after
darrone.
darrone
suggests
there
can
be
an
unintentional
violation.
let
me
say
i
don't
think,
i
think
you
do
have
an
issue
of
contract
interpretation,
and
that
seems
like
a
reasonable
issue.
in
other
words,
if
the
states
had
no
reason
or
the
private
institution
had
no
reason
to
think
what
it
was
doing
was
a
violation,
then
you
may
have
a
question
of
whether
that's
sufficient
intent
to
enforce
the
spending
clause
legislation
against
it.
but
it
seems
a
very
different
thing
when
we
allege
and
if
we
prove
that
this
is
intentional.
it
can't
be
that
the
state
here,
or
the
school
district
rather,
didn't
know
that
this
was
a
violation.
in
fact
they
didn't
have
in
place
a
mechanism
for
students
to
go
and
complain
or
make
known
any
concern
about
this
kind
of
sexual
harassment.
they
were
in
flat
violation
of
the
regulation.
so
any
notion
that
they,
so
to
speak,
weren't
contractually
aware
i
don't
think
is
indicated
here.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
believe
she
could
have,
justice
blackmun.
1983
would
apply
here,
of
course,
because
this
was
a
school
board.
title
ix,
however,
is
far
broader
in
its
scope
and
applies
to
private
institutions
as
well.
and
i
guess
one
other
point
i'd
just
like
to
note
there,
justice
blackmun,
is
that
i
think
she
is
entitled
to
a
claim
under
1983,
but
i
think
she
might
run
into
the
argument
that,
a
sea
clammers'
type
of
argument
that
title
ix
has
its
own
remedial
scheme
and
so
she
might
be
preempted.
i
don't
think
that's
a
good
argument,
but
i
think
it
might
be
raised.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
she
would
have
to
certainly
meet
the
criteria
under
monell,
and
i
think
we
can
meet
those
criteria
in
the--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
let
me
say
i
don't
think
we'd
have
to
meet
it
under
title
ix.
i
agree
with
that.
but
i
don't
know
that
that
issue
is
necessarily--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
want
to
say
i
don't
think
that's
surprising
in
the
following
sense.
of
course,
congress
has
expressly
abrogated
the
eleventh
amendment
under
title
ix.
it
hasn't
done
that
under
1983.
so
i
think
the
notion
that
congress
intended
broader
protection
under
title
ix
is
at
least
consistent
with
the
one
action
it
took
in
that
regard.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
correct,
but
it
is
applied
to
states.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
right.
maybe
i
hadn't
made
myself
clear,
i
don't
believe.
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
is
that
the
notion
that
congress
might
have
intended
broader
protections
in
general,
not
specifically
with
respect
to
municipalities,
under
title
ix
than
under
1983
is
consistent
with
the
fact
that
under
title
ix
they
eliminated
a
protection
conventionally
available
for
the
states.
i
agree
that
has
no
bearing
directly
on
the
cities.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
my
position
is
that
punitive
damages
would
be
allowed,
but
i
will
acknowledge,
justice
kennedy,
that
that
doesn't
follow
inexorably
from
the
conclusion
that
compensatory
damages
would
be
allowed.
the
court,
under
section
1983
in
cases
like
facts
concert,
has
suggested
that
punitive
damages
are
a
different
matter
historically
and
otherwise
with
respect
to
municipalities.
and
it
seems
to
me
at
least
an
argument
could
be
made,
it's
not
an
argument
i
would
make,
but
an
argument
could
be
made
to
that
effect
in
the
subsequent
case.
this
case,
of
course,
only
presents
compensatory
damages.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes.
that's
what
i
suggested
to--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--have
you
held
that
sex
discrimination
is
covered
under
1983?
well,
i
don't...
i
guess
what
i
would
say
is
what
you
have
held
is
that
1983
applies
to
the
constitution
and
the
laws,
and
title
ix
is
a
law,
and
under
title
ix
sex
discrimination
is
barred.
so
my
argument
would
be
yes,
it
applies
under
1983.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
through
title
ix.
yeah.
i
don't
think...
well,
i
don't
think
1983
gives
you
any
independent
rights.
it's
a
remedial--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--yes.
i
think
there
are
several...
several
reasons
to
come
to
that
conclusion,
justice
souter,
and
i
think
they
are
quite
strong.
first
of
all,
of
course,
atascadero
itself
was
a
case
involving
compensatory
damages
and
injunctive
relief.
second
of
all,
if
you're
only
talking
about
an
injunctive
remedy
it
seems
there'd
be
no
reason
to
possibly
abrogate
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
is
correct.
and
then
i
think,
to
address
that
question
specifically,
the
legislative
history
and
particularly
this
is
a
statute
that
was
introduced
on
the
floor,
an
amendment
introduced
on
the
floor
and
senator
cranston
introduced
it.
and
he
flatly
states
that
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
allow
all
the
remedies,
including
damages,
which
we
have
always
intended.
and
so
i
think
the
clear
consistent
view
is
that.
and
let
me
suggest
there's
another
at
least
inferential
reason,
justice
souter,
and
aside
from
the
direct
evidence,
which
is
frankly
not
quoted
in
my
brief
but
quoted
in
the
brief
by
the
civil
rights
groups.
but
the
other
reason
to
infer
that
is
in
1984
this
court
hadn't
simply
upheld
back
pay
under
darrone.
it
also
said
in
smith
v.
robinson
that
the
lower
courts
generally
agree
that
damages
are
available
under
504.
so
against
the
legal
climate
that
congress
was
arguing
in,
i
think
there's
every
reason
to
think
it
assumed,
as
the
court
had
indicated,
that
damages
and
back
pay
were
available,
once
directly,
once
indirectly.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i'd
like
to
move
back
just
a
moment,
if
i
could,
because
i
think
this
issue
of
direct
congressional
intent
bears
some
elaboration.
i
would
like
to
move
back
and
talk
first
about
1972
and
then
about
post-cannon
congressional
intent.
i
think
they're
consistent,
but
i
think
there's
one
difference
that
becomes
important.
now,
first
of
all,
i
think,
without
trying
to
re-argue
the
cannon
case,
i
think
one
or
two
key
points
bear
emphasizing,
and
that
is
in
1972
when
congress
enacted
title
ix
there
is
no
dispute
it
mirrored
it
on
title
vi
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
it
was
essentially
an
analog
that
substituted
sex
for
race.
now,
title
vi...
two
things
had
happened,
however,
that
were
key
between
'64
and
'72.
title
vi
had
been
consistently
and
frequently
interpreted
by
the
lower
courts
to
provide
a
private
right
of
action.
now,
no
lower
court
suggested
a
limitation
on
remedy.
none.
at
the
same
time
between
'64
and
'72,
this
court's
cases
uniformly
made
clear
that
a
private,
an
implied
right
of
action
means
a
right
to
damages.
that's
what
the
jurisprudence
was.
the
court
had
never
uncoupled
the
notion
of
an
implied
right
of
action
from
damages.
and
in
the
case
that
must
be
most
relevant,
in
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park,
the
court
concluded
that
an
1866
civil
rights
act
included
an
implied
remedy
for
damages.
so
it
seems
to
me
under
conventional
principles
still
applied
by
this
court
that
title
ix
basically
has
to
be
read
as
incorporating
that
congressional
understanding.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
no,
no,
it
was
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
because
the
court's
principle
in
several
cases...
it
was
not
just
sullivan,
the
1982
case.
what
the
court
had
adopted
in
borak,
in
sullivan,
in
several
other
cases
in
this
era,
was
if
a
statute
indicates
an
intent
to
protect
rights
we
will
take
that
intent
and
the
courts
will
fully
enforce
them.
that
was
the
rule.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
believe...
i
believe
it's
flatly
stated.
and
the
rule
is,
what
the
court
in
sullivan
flatly
states,
is
when
there
is
a
cause
of
action
we
will
make
available
all
remedies
to
effectuate
it,
and
that
was
an
implied
cause
of
action
case.
1982,
of
course,
doesn't
contain
an
express
cause
of
action.
so
i
think
the
law
was
really
very
settled.
now
i
realize
that
today
the
law
is
different
with
respect
to
when
you
might
imply
a
right
of
action.
but
i'm
looking
at
congress'
intent
in
1972,
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
two
principles,
that
title
vi
had
a
private
right
and
that
a
private
right
had
never
been
uncoupled
from
a
damages
remedy
by
this
court,
were
clear
at
that
point.
then
i
think,
and
in
fact
i
think
the
court
in
cannon
itself
relied
on
those
cases
expressly
in
reaching
the
conclusion
that
there
was
an
implied
right
of
action.
but
then
i
think
we
should
look
at
post-1979,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
whatever
doubt
congress
might
have
had
about
the
scope
of
the
remedies
under
title
ix
was
cleared
up
in
1979
when
cannon
came
down
because
the
court
then
said
yes,
you
do
have
a
private
right
of
action.
and
in
1979
there
had
never
been
a
case
in
this
court
that
had
uncoupled
a
private
right
of
action
from
a
damages
remedy.
and
i
suggest
that
congress
has
taken
two
actions
since
then
that
supports
their
understanding
that
damages
are
available
and
as
well
the
view
that
they
endorse
that
understanding.
one
is
the
discussion
i
had
with
justice
souter
a
few
moments
ago
about
the
atascadero
statute,
the
remedies
equalization
act
which
i
think
is
fairly
read,
particularly
in
light
of
its
legislative
history,
to
support
damages.
and
second,
only
last
year
in
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
which
congress
passed
it
extended
section
504.
now,
504,
just
like
title
ix,
is
based
on
title
vi,
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
three
statutes
in
terms
of
their
remedial
schemes
are
read
in
parry
material.
and
what
the
court
held,
what
congress
did
under
504
is
to
say...
under
the
americans
with
disabilities,
pardon
me,
is
to
say
look,
we
are
now
applying
a
right
to
programs
that
don't
get
federal
monies.
that
is
504
said
if
you
get
federal
monies
and
discriminate
on
handicap,
you're
not
allowed
to
discriminate
on
handicap.
then
congress
says
we're
going
to
extend
that
to
state
and
local
programs
that
do
not
receive
federal
monies,
and
in
extending
it
it
says
we
intend
to
extend
the
damages
remedy
that
has
been
recognized
under
section
504.
and
i
suggest
to
you
again
that
that
intent
reflects
a
consistent
understanding.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that,
unfortunately,
and
i
apologize,
mr.,
justice
scalia,
that
is
in
the
brief
of
the
amici
curiae,
the
american
council
of
the
blind,
and
it
is
discussed
on
pages
24
through
25.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
statute,
justice
scalia,
simply
incorporates
the
remedies
available
under
504.
it
expressly
does
that.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
what
i--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
apologize.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
what
i
meant
to
suggest
is
the
statute
expressly
incorporates
the
remedies
available
under
504.
that's
all
it
says,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
congress
reflected
its
understanding
that
that
included
a
damages
right.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
we
now
have
a
20-year
relationship,
basically
from
'72
to
the
present,
where
the
court
and
congress
have
interacted
in
a
way
that
indicates
at
least
now
that
damages
are
under...
available
under
title
ix,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
good
reason
to
undo
that
understanding.
i
would
suggest
that
the
contrary
is
actually
true
because
in
cannon
the
case
is
almost
unique
in
that
this
court
announced
to
congress
that
it
would
apply
the
legal
standards
applicable
in
1972
to
title
ix.
that's
what
it
said,
and
indeed
i
think
it
went
on
to
suggest,
at
least
in
the
concurring
opinion,
that
in
the
future
congress
ought
to
understand
that
new
rules
will
govern
new
statutes.
but
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
that
than
telling
congress
the
1970
rules
apply
to
the
context
of
this
statute.
now,
despite
that
clear
direction
to
congress,
the
solicitor
general
and
the
united
states...
and
the
respondent,
want
to
argue
here
that
the
court
should
apply
a
completely
new
view
of
interpreting
title
ix.
i
would
say
in
response
that
that...
that
position
is
not
only
unfair
given
the
history
we
have
discussed,
but
it
also
quite
frankly
is
wrong
under
modern
standards
of
applied
right
of
action.
that
is
to
say
i
think
it
is
fairly
concluded
based
on
thompson
v.
thompson
that
all
nine
members
of
the
court
reaffirmed
a
view
that
cannon's
conclusion
that
congress
intended
a
private
right
of
action,
that
that
conclusion
was
supportable.
in
the
view
of
two
justices
that
was
based
upon
the
narrower
title
vi
incorporation
theory
i
discussed.
only
then
did
justice
scalia,
in
a
separate,
in
a
separate
concurring
opinion,
say
he
would
move
the
law
further
and
would
eliminate
implied
rights
of
action
altogether.
under
that
view
i
recognize
we
would
not
be
in
court.
however,
justice
scalia
said
that's
not
the
law.
and
he
further
said
if
it
were
to
become
the
law
it
would
have
to
be
applied
only
prospectively
to
new
statutes
when
congress
understood
what
the
rules
of
the
game
then
were.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i'll
reserve.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
respondent
and
the
solicitor
general
are
here
today
asking
the
court
to
legislate
between
back
pay
on
the
one
hand
and
damages
on
the
other.
they
think
that
it's
a
better
means
of
enforcement
to
allow
for
back
pay
and
not
for
damages.
i
submit
to
the
court
there
is
nothing
in
what
we
have
talked
about
today,
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
enactments,
in
this
court's
decisions,
that
would
make
that
distinction
tenable.
and
the
solicitor
general
significantly
did
not
tell
the
court
what
in
the
legislative
history,
what
in
the
statute
supports
back
pay
and
not
damages.
the
second
point
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
respondent's
argument
about
money
not
being
available
against
cities
and
states
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
back-pay
remedy.
all
of
these
arguments
about
immunity
cannot
be
squared
with
back
pay.
they
apply
equally.
second
of
all
in
that
regard,
respondent
tells
us
there
was
no
back
pay,
there
was
no
monetary
remedies
against
states
and
cities
during
this
era.
then
he
says
let's
look
at
the
cases
from
'64
to
'72
under
title
vi.
and
what
does
he
say?
he
said
they
all
had
1983
actions,
but
he's
just
told
us
that
1983
doesn't
provide
damages
or
back
pay
against
the
cities.
so
these
title
ix
claims
were
the
ones
that
provided
for
the
monetary
relief.
finally,
i
would
submit,
we
have
seen
a
fair
amount
of
historical
revisionism
here.
i
asserted
in
my
opening
argument
and
i
will
stick
by
it,
if
you
read
the
court's
precedents
between
'64
and
'72,
which
i
suggest
is
the
critical
period
because
that's
when
title
vii,
title
vi,
and
title
ix
were
passed,
the
one
mirrored
on
the
other,
those
cases
say
if
you
have
an
implied
right
of
action
you
have
damages.
the
solicitor
general
says
look
at
the
allen
case.
i
welcome
the
opportunity.
allen
provides...
allen
was
a
case
involving
enforcement
of
section
v
of
the
voting
rights
act.
all
that
section
v
provides
is
for
preclearance.
so
the
only
possible
remedy
in
that
statute
would
be
an
order
declaring
or
enjoining
the
preclearance
of
the
statute.
there
could
not
have
been
damages.
the
other
cases
that
i
discussed
uniformly
accept
damages.
finally,
during
the
period
'68...
during
the
period
1964
to
1972...
again,
the
crucible
i
think
we
want
to
look
at
for
'72
intent...
not
only
had
congress
passed
the
fair
housing
act,
which
included
expressly
a
damages...
which
included
a
damages
remedy
expressly
under
civil
rights
enforcement,
not
only
had
this
court
come
down
with
little
hunting
park,
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park,
which
included
a
damages
remedy
under
another
civil
rights
statute,
but
in
addition
to
those
events
the
key
point
is
that
the
notion
that
this
would
be
an
effective
statute,
justice
stevens,
without
damages
for
students
is
an
untenable
one.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is,
look,
what
does
respondent
and
the
solicitor
general
say?
here
we
have
a
statute
that
applies
to
schools,
and
they
say
you
can
get
back
pay
under
it.
but
who
are
the
beneficiaries,
the
primary
beneficiaries?
they
are
obviously
students.
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
and
for
students
back
pay
is
useless.
now,
to
be
sure,
any
remedy
can
be
mooted
out,
as
respondent
suggests,
if
you
give
people
what
they
want.
and
if
they
gave
our
client
the
damages
she
is
entitled
to
we
wouldn't
go
to
court
either,
but
it
is
strange
to
think
that
congress
would
have
implied
a
remedy
for
back
pay
and
not
for
damages
under
a
statute
where
back
pay
is
meaningless
for
most
people.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that's
a
feasible
hypothesis,
but
i
think
it's
belied
by
the
following,
justice
scalia,
and
that
is
of
course
the
same
year
they
passed
19...
title
ix
they
extended
title
vii
to
public
and
private...
to
public
entities
including
schools.
so
they
already
had
the
teachers
covered.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
want
to
be
careful
in
answering
this
question
to
you
in
particular
because
what
i
said
before
which
i
think
is
right
is
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
says
that
it
incorporates
the
remedies
under
504.
now,
i
understand
that
on
its
face
that
means
whatever
the
remedies
are,
that's
what
they
are.
what
i
suggest
to
you
is
that
congress
in
the
legislative
history
indicated
that
it
understood
and
intended
those
remedies
to
include
damages.
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
no.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
is
my...
i
think
that
is
a
clear
inference
of
what
i've
just
said.
and
the
final
distinction,
if
i
might
before
i
sit
down,
is
let's
look
at
the
difference
between
a
statute
like
title
vii
on
the
one
hand
and
the
fair
housing
act
and
title
ix
on
the
other.
for
most
employees
back
pay
is
going
to
be
a
meaningful
remedy.
it
may
not
be
a
complete
remedy,
but
it's
going
to
be
a
remedy
that's
going
to
ensure
enforcement
of
the
statute
because
it's
a
significant
one.
in
fair
housing,
4
years
before
title
ix,
congress
says
you
can
get
damages.
and
why
does
it
say
that?
because
in
the
fair
housing
context,
by
the
time
you
get
an
injunction,
it's
too
late.
