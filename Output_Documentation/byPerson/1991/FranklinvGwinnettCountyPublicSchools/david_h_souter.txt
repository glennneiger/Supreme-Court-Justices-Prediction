justice
souter
--mr.
klein,
to
the
extent
that
the
eleventh
amendment
waiver
is
at
least
a
relevant
consideration
for
us,
is
there
any
clear
indication
that
the
intention,
the
congressional
intention
in
doing
that
was
to
open
the
states
wide
open
to
damage
remedies
as
opposed
to
getting
around
a
more
limited
edelman
and
jordan?
justice
souter
well,
there
wouldn't
to
the
extent
that
it
was
merely
injunction,
but
to
the
extent
that
equity
would
be
awarding
any
monetary
relief
there
would
be
a
reason.
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
well,
this
is
one...
isn't
this
one
such
case
on
your
argument?
in
other
words,
isn't
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
no,
there
is
no
equitable
relief
which
she
will
seek?
justice
souter
okay.
but
the
answer
is
that
the
student
would
have
no
reason
to
seek
equitable
relief
in
this
case.
