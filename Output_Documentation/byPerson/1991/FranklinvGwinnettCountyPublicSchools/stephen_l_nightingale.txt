mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
governing
principle
in
this
area,
we
submit,
is
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
pursue
only
those
remedies
that
congress
has
authorized,
and
in
determining
what
congress
has
intended
we
further
submit
that
there
is
no
factual
or
theoretical
basis
for
presuming
that
congress
approaches
statutory
remedies
on
an
all-or-nothing
basis.
in
other
words
that
it...
when
it
sets
out
to
create
a
private
remedy
it
conceives
of
remedies
in
units
called
causes
of
action
and
delegates
to
courts
the
authority
to
fill
out
those
causes
of
action
in
whatever
manner
courts
consider
appropriate.
indeed
in
the
context
relevant
to
this
case,
experience
suggests
precisely
the
opposite.
there
is
no
dispute
that
title
ix
was
patterned
after
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
none
of
the
titles,
none
of
the
private
rights
of
action
created
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
provided
for
traditional
legal
damages.
title
vii
provided
for
an
expressed
right
of
action
for
equitable
remedies
including
back
pay.
title
ii
provided
for
preventive
relief.
two
other
titles
reserved
whatever
remedies
were
available
from
other
sources
but
created
no
private
remedies.
and
indeed
the
most
aggressive
advocates
of
private
remedies
in
1964
in
the
context
of
title
vi
suggested
only
a
provision
that
would
have
authorized
private
parties
to
seek
preventive
relief.
justice
scalia,
i
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
for
believing
that
congress
in
this
area
conceives
of
the
traditional
legal
remedy
of
damages
as
being
the
remedy
of
choice.
the
experience
suggests
that
congress
has
thought
of
equitable
relief
as
the
more
likely
remedy.
the
court
has
also
abandoned,
in
the
context
of
statutory
remedies,
the
presumption
that
a
grant
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
authorizes
the
courts
to
grant
whatever
remedies
courts
may
consider
appropriate
to
vindicate
rights.
in
davis
v.
passman
the
court
made
clear
that
that...
that
it
will
continue
general
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
as
a
basis
for
conferring
remedies
with
respect
to
violations
of
constitutional
rights,
but
it
has
made
clear
that
at
the
same
time
that
with
respect
to
statutes
the
touchstone
must
be
congressional
intent.
indeed
within
a
period
of
weeks
after
davis
v.
passman
the
court
issued
its
opinion
in
touche
ross
and
redington,
indicating
that
the
question
of
remedies
is
one
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
it
is,
your
honor.
that
is
our
position.
in
davis
v.
passman
the
court
said
as
much.
we're...
the
petitioner
suggests
that
title
ix
should
be
construed
with
respect
to
precedents
preceding
its
enactment
in
1972.
i
have
a
couple
of
points
with
respect
to
that.
first
of
all,
in
allen
v.
state
board
of
elections,
which
is
a
case
predating
1972,
the
court
did
recognize
a
private
right
of
action
limited
to
declaratory...
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief.
there
was,
to
be
sure,
no
request
for
damages
in
that
case,
but
it
cannot
fairly
be
said,
i
think,
that
the
court
has
never
considered
the
possibility,
even
before
1972,
that
damages
necessarily
accompanied
any
private
right
of
action.
secondly,
last
term
in
the
virginia
bankshares
case,
the
court
indicated
very
clearly
that
although
it
would
not
overrule
previously
recognized
causes
of
action,
that
in
determining
their
scope
and
in
rounding
them
out,
if
you
will,
it
would
refer
to
the
principles
that
have
informed
its
decisions
in
recent
times.
in
that
case
it
was
dealing
with
a
cause
of
action
recognized
in
the
borak
case.
rather
than
take...
than
consider
principles
that
might
have
been
in
congress'
contemplation
in
the
1930's,
it
analyzed
the
case
from
the
standpoint
of
its
current
jurisprudence.
again,
i
think
the...
i'd
like
to
turn
briefly
to
petitioner's
reliance
on
the
post-title
ix
statutes.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
suggestion
that
the
private
right
of
action
that
petitioner
seeks
was
created
at
any
time
after
1972.
the
issue
before
the
court,
in
other
words,
is
what
congress
intended
in
1972
when
it
enacted
title
ix.
the
1986
congressional
action
on
its
face
doesn't
tell
us
very
much
about
what
the
1972
congress
itself
meant,
and
therefore
we
believe
that
it
should
not
displace
the
court's
consideration
and
the
materials
that
were
determinative
as
of
1972.
beyond
that,
on
its
face
the
text
of
the
19...
1986
act
only
says
that
remedies,
including
actions
at
equity
and
at
law,
will
be
available
from
state
entities
to
the
same
extent
as
they
would
be
applicable
from
private
parties.
the
goal
was
to
equalize
remedies,
whatever
they
might
be.
the
statute
on
its
face
does
not
recognize
any
particular
remedy
against
any
particular
defendant.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
right,
the
equalization
act.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
not
in
damages,
your
honor,
we
submit.
our
position
is
that
the
same
remedies
are
available
from
all
defendants
under
title
ix,
and
they
are
limited
to
equitable
relief.
the...
there
is
further
the
suggestion
that
there
has
been
a
unanimous
judicial
view
that
damages
are
recoverable
under
funding
statutes.
in
truth
there
has
not
been
anything
of
the
sort
that
would
justify
the
court
in
assuming
that
congress
in
1986,
or
more
recently
when
it
passed
the
other
statute
on
which
my
opponent
relies,
was
ratifying
a
consensus
here.
our
brief
at
the
petition
stage
sets
forth
the
rather
sharp
division
among
the
courts
on
this
issue.
after
this
court's
decision
in
cannon,
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
damages
were
unavailable
under
title
ix.
there
was
a
split
among
the
circuits
under
the
handicap
act.
and
in
considering
those
cases
the
court
should
also
be
aware
that
a
number
of
them
were
decided
under
the
education
for
all
handicapped
act
and
sought
sums
that
in
the
school
committee
of
burlington
in
this
case
this
court
said
were
not
damages.
so
that
in...
casual
references
in
many
handicapped
act
cases
to
awards
of
damages
we
think
should
be
taken
carefully.
there
is
at
best
a
split
among
the
courts
under
these
three
related
statutes,
title
vi,
title
ix,
and
the
rehabilitation
act
on
the
question
whether
damages,
traditional
legal
damages,
are
available.
finally,
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
in
the
context
of
this
statute
as
a
whole
there
is
no
reason,
we
submit,
to
ascribe
to
congress
the
view
that
legal
damages
are
necessary
for
effective
enforcement
of
this
statute.
in
the
only
express
remedy
for
a
violation
of
this
statute--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--we
are
emphasizing
the
fact
that
the
obligation
is
tied
to
receipt
of
federal
funds
and
therefore
we
believe
it
is
significant,
as
members
of
the
court
have
suggested,
that
entities
be
aware
of
what
sorts
of
obligations
they
are
accepting.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
the...
what
we
suggest,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
should
approach
the
materials
relating
to
each
statute
and
determine
what
remedies
congress
has
authorized.
we
don't
believe
that
congress
approaches
this
matter
from
the
standpoint
of
an
all-or-nothing
analysis.
thank
you
very
much.
