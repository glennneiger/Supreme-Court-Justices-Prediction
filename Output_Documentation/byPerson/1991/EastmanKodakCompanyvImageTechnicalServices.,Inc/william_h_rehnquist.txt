mr.
pickett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
pickett,
you're
giving
us
kind
of
a
narrative
account
of
things.
and
yet
this
did
come
up
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
where
all
disputed
facts
are
to
be
resolved
against
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
hope
you'll
be
careful
when
you
give
the
narrative
account
to
make
sure
that
you
limit
yourself
to
the
sort
of
things
you're
justified
in
arguing
on
this
posture.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
on
whom
is
the
burden
of
proof
in
that
situation
in
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
since
they...
you
say
they
had
the
burden
of
proof.
there
were
affidavits
in
opposition
to
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
pickett.
mr.
rill,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
then
that
matsushita,
or
matsushita,
as
you
pronounce
it,
laid
down
a
different
rule
as
to
summary
judgment
for
antitrust
cases
than
prevails
in
the
rest
of
the
legal
area?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
its
opinion
here,
took
the
position
that
maybe
things
wouldn't
work
out
in
the
real
world,
so
to
speak,
the
same
way
they
do
in
economic
theory.
and
while
the
district
court
might
have
been
justified
in
granting
summary
judgment
as
a
matter
of
pure
economic
models,
that
was
not
necessarily
controlling,
so
far
as
summary
judgment
would
be
concerned.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
rill--
--is
that
why
they
left
the
xxx
market?
--there
is
a
certain
amount
of
very
theoretical
approach
to
your
presentation,
that
this
is
the
way
the
market
is
going
to
behave,
without
any
real,
empirical
evidence,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is...
i
agree
it's
very
logical.
but
i
am
still
not
totally
persuaded
that
there
wasn't
something
in
what
the
ninth
circuit
said.
how
can
we
know,
at
this
stage,
that
this
is
the
way
it
would
work
out
in
practice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rill.
mr.
hennefer,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
with...
are
you
withdrawing
any
concessions
that
you've
made
previously
in
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
are
you
contesting
issues
now
that
you
did
not
contest
earlier?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
issues
are
those
that
you're
contesting
now
that
you
didn't
contest
earlier?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
we're
entitled
to
do
may...
is
one
thing.
what
we're
willing
to
do
may
be
another.
in
our
recent
change
of
rules
in
our
opinion
of
oklahoma
city
against
tuttle
says
if
you
don't
raise...
if
you
don't
make
an
objection
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to...
as
to
why
a
question
raised
in
a
petition
for
certiorari
can't
be
reached
by
us,
your
objections
are
waived.
are
you
familiar
with
that
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
next
time
you
have
a
response
here,
you
probably
ought
to
read
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suggest
that
you
not
go
too
heavily
into
that
point,
since
i
think
it's
waived.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hennefer,
on
whom
do
you
think
the
burden
of
proof
is
as
to
this
particular
issue
that
you're
talking
about
with
justice
scalia?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
an
affirmative
defense
denominated
as
such
in
the
antitrust
laws
or
just
in
the
summary
judgment
process?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it's
an
affirmative
defense,
i
would
think
you'd
say
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
kodak.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
that
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
then
it's
not
up
to
you
to
negate
anything;
it's
up
to
them
to
prove
something
beyond
any
triable
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
evidence
before
the
trial
court,
mr.
hennefer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
was
not
before
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
before
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hennefer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
pickett,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
have
a...
case
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pickett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-1029,
eastman
kodak
company
against

technical
services,

will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
