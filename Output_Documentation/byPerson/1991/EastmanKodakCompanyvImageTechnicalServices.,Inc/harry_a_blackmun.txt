justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
litigation
which
comes
to
us
from
the
ninth
circuit
is
an
anti-trust
case.
the
respondents
brought
this
lawsuit
alleging
that
kodak
unlawfully
had
tied
the
sale
of
service
for
its
machines
to
the
sale
of
parts
in
violation
of
section
one
of
the
sherman
act,
and
had
monopolized
the
sale
of
service
in
parts
for
those
machines
in
violation
of
section
2
of
that
act.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
kodak
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
ruled
that
the
plaintiffs
had
presented
enough
evidence
to
raise
a
genuine
issue
concerning
kodak's
market
power
in
the
service
and
parts
markets.
it
also
rejected
kodak's
contention
that
lack
of
market
power
in
service
and
parts
must
be
assumed
when
such
power
is
absent
in
the
equipment
market.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
we
rule
that
kodak
has
not
met
the
requirements
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
for
an
award
of
summary
judgment
on
the
section
1
claim,
and
we
also
hold
that
plaintiffs
have
presented
genuine
issues
per
trial
as
to
whether
kodak
had
monopolized
the
service
and
parts
market
in
violation
of
section
2.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
justices
o'connor
and
thomas.
