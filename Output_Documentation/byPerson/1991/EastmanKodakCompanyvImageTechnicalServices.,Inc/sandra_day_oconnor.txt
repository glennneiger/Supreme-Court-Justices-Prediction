mr.
pickett,
may
i
ask
a
question?
i'm
unclear
about
these
things
that
the
respondents
wanted
to
buy
from
kodak.
are
they
things
manufactured
by
kodak,
or
does
kodak,
in
turn,
buy
these
things
from
other
suppliers?
justice
sandra

so
the
only
source
of
supply
would
have
to
be
from
kodak,
if
the
respondents
were
to
buy
these
parts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
if
you
were
correct
that
somebody
other
than
kodak
makes
the
parts,
then
couldn't
your
clients
buy
parts
from
those
other
people?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
district
court
found
there
was
no
conspiracy--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--between
kodak
and
the
suppliers
of
parts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
was
the
finding,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
didn't
petition
for
cert
on
that.
yet,
you
want
to
argue
that
finding
was
erroneous.
