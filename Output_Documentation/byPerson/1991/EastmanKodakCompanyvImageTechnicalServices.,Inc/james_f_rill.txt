mr.
james
f.
rill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two,
central
points
to
the
argument
of
the
united
states
in
this
case.
first,
the
iso
claim
that
kodak
can
possess
and
exploit
market
power
in
the
parts
and
service
market,
when
it
lacks
market
power
in
the
equipment
market,
is
implausible,
as
a
matter
of
antitrust
law
and
economic
theory.
second,
when
a
plaintiff,
seeking
to
avoid
summary
judgment,
attempts
to
put
forward
an
implausible
argument,
or
argument
based
on
an
implausible
theory,
it
is
required
under
rule
56
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
matsushita
case,
to
come
forward
with
particularly
persuasive,
probative,
and
substantial
evidence
in
support
of
a
cogent
theory
of
antitrust
liability.
mr.
james
f.
rill
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not.
the
rule
for
summary
judgment
is,
of
course,
prescribed
in
rule
56
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure;
and
in
particular,
rule
56(e).
matsushita
stands
for
the
proposition
that
this
court
recognized
that
in
antitrust
cases,
where
conduct
can
be
often
ambiguous
and
can
permit
an
inference
of
procompetitive
as
well
as
anticompetitive
conduct,
it
is
particularly
appropriate
to
use
the
vehicle
of
summary
judgment
to
prevent
the
deterrence
of
procompetitive
conduct
that
would
result
from
the
threat
of
costly,
time-consuming,
antitrust
trials,
particularly
where
they
proceed
on
a
per
se
theory.
mr.
james
f.
rill
yes,
your
honor,
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
reversing
summary
judgment
on
the
grounds
of
some
generalized...
with
all
respect...
speculation
with
respect
to
market
imperfections
that
might
exist.
when
kodak
came
forward
and
set
out
the
point
that
it
was
not
contested,
that
it
lacked
market
power
in
the
equipment
market,
it
became
incumbent
upon
the
iso's
under
rule
56
and
under
matsushita,
to
come
forward
with
specific,
substantial,
probative
evidence
that
raised
a
genuine
issue
as
to
a
cogent
theory
of
antitrust
liability.
mr.
james
f.
rill
justice
stevens,
the
answer
is
yes.
there
is
an
issue
as
to
whether
there
is
market
power
in
the
parts
market.
the
absence
of
market
power
in
the
equipment
market,
however,
makes
it
implausible...
as
that
term
is
used
in
matsushita...
for
kodak
to
be
able
to
exercise
market
power
in
the
parts
market.
mr.
james
f.
rill
as
this
case
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
came
up
upon
review
before
this
court,
there's
been
a
concession
that
the
parts
market
can
be
a
relevant
market.
mr.
james
f.
rill
the
parts
market
can
be
a
relevant
market,
as
this
case
is
presented.
however,
the
absence
of
market
power
in
the
primary
market,
the
equipment
market,
makes
it
impossible--
mr.
james
f.
rill
--implausible.
i
stand
corrected.
mr.
james
f.
rill
i
stand
corrected,
justice
stevens,
quite
right...
implausible
for
kodak
to
exercise
market
power
in
the
parts
market.
now,
it
could
have
argued--
mr.
james
f.
rill
--it
could
have
argued
below...
well,
no,
we're
saying
it's
implausible
that
it
has
market
power
in
the
parts
market--
mr.
james
f.
rill
--and
it
could
well
have
argued
below,
that
if
it
were--
mr.
james
f.
rill
--well,
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
because
the...
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged--
mr.
james
f.
rill
--the--
mr.
james
f.
rill
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged
at
the...
that
the
customers
make
a
parts,
equipment,
and
service
price
assessment
as
a
package
at
the
time
they
purchase
the
equipment.
mr.
james
f.
rill
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged
that
customers
do
it.
the
mere
fact
that
the
customers--
mr.
james
f.
rill
--the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there's
no
claim
in
this
record
that
kodak
discriminated
among
customers
who
made
that
assessment
and
did
not
make
that
a
system...
assessment.
kodak
would
be
required,
in
the
competitive
equipment
market,
to
price
the
total
package
competitively,
or
suffer
a
very
severe
runoff
of
equipment
sales
to
its
competitors
in
the
equipment
market.
since
kodak
needs
to
sell
equipment
to
sell
parts
and
service,
it's
going
to
have
to
package--
mr.
james
f.
rill
--no,
no,
justice
stevens,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged
that
customers
made
that
assessment.
the
fact
that
customers
make
that
assessment
requires
kodak
to
behave
competitively
in
the
equipment
market.
mr.
james
f.
rill
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
justice
stevens,
that
tells
us
that--
mr.
james
f.
rill
--as
the
case
is
presented
to
this
court.
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged
that
customers
make
that
comparison
at
the
time
they
purchase
equipment.
and
that--
mr.
james
f.
rill
--no,
it
does
not.
mr.
james
f.
rill
that
is--
mr.
james
f.
rill
--my
wife
and
i
had
a
discussion
of
sharp
cheese
as
well.
mr.
james
f.
rill
because
manufacturers
will
behave
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
sophisticated
buyers'
behaving
competitively
makes
it
implausible
and
self-defeating
for
manufacturers
to
attempt
to
exploit
the
parts
and
service
market,
because
they're
going
to
behaving...
behave
competitively--
mr.
james
f.
rill
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
argument
proceeds
very
logically,
and
very
practically
from
the
hyde
decision.
mr.
james
f.
rill
well,
if
kodak
had
attempted
to
tie
service
to
equipment,
clearly
that
would
fall
under
the
court's
decision
in
the
hyde
case,
because
it
lacks
market
power
in
the
equipment
market.
why
should
a
stricter
standard
be
applied
to
kodak
when,
in
fact,
it
has
exercised
a
less-restrictive
policy
of
tying
service
to
parts?
it
needs
to
sell
equipment
in
order
to
sell
parts
and
service.
it
needs
to
present
a
competitively
priced
package
to
customers
who
make
comparison,
and
to
behave
competitively
in
the
equipment
market.
mr.
james
f.
rill
justice
kennedy,
they
would
have
had
to
show
a
triable
issue.
they
would
have
had
to
show
a
genuine
dispute
as
to
the
issue
of
market
power
in
the
equipment
market
in
order
to
go
to
trial
in
this
case.
mr.
james
f.
rill
you
would
then
have
to
still
make
a
determination
that
market
power
would
have
to
exist
in
the
equipment
market,
because
in
the
absence
of
market
power
in
the
equipment
market,
it
is
implausible
for
kodak
to
attempt
to
exercise
market
power
in
the
parts
market,
so
as
to
create
a
service
parts
tie.
with
respect
to
your
market
definition
question,
i
will
certainly
say
that
this
case
could
have
come
up,
could
have
come
up
on
the
issue
of
whether
parts
is
a
separate,
relevant
market.
mr.
james
f.
rill
for
purposes
of
the
way
this
case
is
before
the
court
now,
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states,
we're
willing
to
accept
a
separate
market
and
say
that
it
cannot
be
exploited
in
the
absence
of
market
power
in
the
equipment
market.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
