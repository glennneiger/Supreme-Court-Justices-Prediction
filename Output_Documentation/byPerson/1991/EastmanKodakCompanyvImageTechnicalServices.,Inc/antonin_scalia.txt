mr.
pickett,
i
had
thought
when
we
took
this
case,
that
the
absence
of
market
power
in
the
equipment
market
was
a
given.
but
apparently
it's
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
am
i
mistaken
that
it's
challenged
in
the
briefs
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
response
to
the
petition
for
cert?
was
there
a
challenge
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
your
question
does...
your
question
presented
in
the
petition
is
does
a
vertically
integrated
equipment
manufacturer
that
lacks
market
power
in
fiercely
competitive
interbrand
competition
violate
sherman
act,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
had
assumed
that
that's
what
we
were
going
to
talk
about
today.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
pickett,
your
argument
is
not
that...
not
that
people
can't
enter
a
separate
market
and
make
a
go
of
a
business
in
the
parts
and
service
market
alone.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
point
is
that
you
could
not
monopolize
that
market
without
paying
the
price
in
your
original
equipment
market,
that
the
two
are
connected
to
that
extent?
justice
antonin
scalia
give
away
the
camera
to
sell
the
film.
isn't
that
the
motto
that
the
old
kodak
used
to
use,
years--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
saying
that
they
were
doing
the
same
here.
that
you
may
have
charged
a
lot
for
the
service;
you
gave
away
the
machines
in
order
to
service
them.
and
that's
where
you
were
making
your
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
reason
being...
why
don't
you
spell
out
the
reason
why
that
is?
that
is,
because,
if
it
raises
its
prices
too
high
for
servicing
and
parts,
people
won't
buy
kodak
machines.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
can
buy
other
machines
because
of
the
primary
market--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
have
to
be
all
of
them,
mr.
rill,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
one
of
the
advantages
of
a
free
market,
that
the
sophisticated
customer
helps
the
unsophisticated,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
sharp
cheese
is
very
expensive.
my
wife
calls
this
the
sharp
cheese
theory.
you
can
always
tell
which
cheese
is
sharp.
it's
the
one
that
costs
more.
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
sophisticated
buyers
are
the
one
that
lead
the
market.
so
you
don't
have
to
know
whether
cheese
is
sharp
or
not.
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
why
didn't
you
debate
that
in
the
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari?
because
frankly,
i
was
not
interested
in
considering
whether
there
is
market
power
in
this
primary
market.
that's
not
the
question
we
took
this
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
the
premise
of
the
whole
question
presented,
question
number
one
presented:
does
a
vertically
integrated
equipment
manufacturer
that
lacks
market
power
in
fiercely
competitive
interbrand
equipment
markets
violate
the
sherman
act
by
declining
to
sell
replacement
parts?
given
that
that's
the
question,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
were
choosing
to
contest
the
question
of
whether
they
lack
market
power
or
not,
you
should
have
done
it
in
your
response.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
it
isn't.
i'm
happy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
listen
to
whatever
other
arguments
you
have,
but
not
to
that
one.
oh,
and...
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
there
wasn't
any
issue
about
the
equipment
market?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
none
of
that
would
matter
if
kodak's
principal
point
is
correct.
that
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you...
their
principal
point
is,
you
know,
we're
cutting
off
our
nose
to
spite
our
face
if
we
try
to
monopolize
the...
and
exact
a
monopoly
rent
in
the
parts
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
these
facts
become
quite
irrelevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they're
not
saying
it's
a
per
se
rule.
what
the
argument
is
about
is
whether
that
should
be
assumed
to
be
the
norm,
and
you
have
to
come
up
with
some
evidence
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
to
say
why
the
world
is
not
as
it
seems;
or
rather,
whether
your
theory
should
be
the
norm,
and
they
would
have
to
come
in
to
show
why
the
world
is
not
as
it
seems.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
them
to
be
saying
that.
i
understand
them
to
be
saying
only
that
you
have
to
come
up
with
something
to
show
why
this
particular
market
has
an
imperfection.
for
instance,
if
you
could
have
shown
that
the
purchasers
of
the
parts,
and
of
the
service,
don't
take
into
account
the
life...
the
life
cost
of
equipment
plus
service...
if
you
could
have
shown
that,
i
don't
think
they're
contesting
that
the
case
couldn't
have
gone
forward.
what
they're
saying
is,
you
didn't
come
up
with
anything
that
wouldn't...
that
would
give
anybody
any
reason
to
believe
that
this
market
doesn't
operate
the
way
a
market
operates.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
what
does
that
prove?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
knows
that
they're
charging
twice
as
much
for
the
service,
but
they're
charging
half
as
much
for
the
machine.
did
he
say
i
don't
care
what
the
total
cost
of
the
machine
plus
service
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
you
didn't
come
up
with
something
that
would
show
that
the
market
has
a
lack
of
information.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
show
that
kodak
had
pieced
out
the
market,
that
it
could
discriminate
among
buyers,
that
it
could
discriminate
among
those
buyers
who
did
take
lifetime
value
into
account
and
those
who
didn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
you
introduce
evidence
to
that
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
only
those
buyers?
i
think
your...
your
brother
has
contested
that.
he
said
they'd
allow
all
buyers
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
buyer.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
once
they
introduce
affidavits
showing
facts
on
those
issues,
you
can't
stand
mute.
you
have
to...
you
have
to
come
forward
with
affidavits
showing
facts
to
the
contrary.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
came
forward
with
evidence
showing
that
there
was
no
market
power
in
the
equipment
field,
which
is
what
we
are
assuming
is
established
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
how
much
they're
selling
the
equipment
for.
if
they're
selling
the
equipment
very
cheaply,
they
wouldn't
be
losing
customers.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
they'd
sell
them
below
cost,
but
they'd...
they'd
sell
them
below
the
degree
of
profit
that
their
competitors
are
getting.
i
think
that's
their
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
see
whether
it's
in
the
consumer
welfare
or
not.
suppose
you
have
a
new
entrant
in
this
field.
let's
assume
it's
a
field
that
just
has
a
few,
big
companies.
and
you
have
a
new
entrant.
and
he
says
boy,
it's
going
to
be
hard
to
break
into
this
market.
i'm
going
to
do
it
by
offering
a
really
low
price
for
my
machine.
i'm
barely
going
to
cover
costs
on
it.
and
i'm
going
to...
exclusive
service,
though.
you
have
to
do
service
with
me.
and
i'm
going
to
charge
a
lot
for
that.
and
i'll
tell
all
my
customers.
in
effect,
i'm
giving
you
a
loan.
i'm
willing
to
take
less
now,
but
i'll
get
more
later.
there'll
be
a
good
number
of
customers
who'll
want
to
do
that.
and
therefore,
i'll
be
able
to
break
into
this
market.
why
is
that
against
the
consumer
welfare
to
have
somebody
be
able
to
enter
the
market
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
depends
on
the
price
of
their
equipment.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
making
a
lot
of
arguments
that
are
just
based
upon
normal
human
behavior
and
how
we
interpret
normal,
economic
behavior
to
be.
it
seems
to
me
they're
just
doing
the
same
thing.
they're
saying
that
what
you're
just
proposing
is
crazy,
that
they
would
be
losing
the
market
if
they
tried
to
compel
people
to
buy
their
service,
and
then
over-price
the
service.
people
say
never
mind,
i'll
buy
somebody
else's
machine.
it
makes
no
sense.
