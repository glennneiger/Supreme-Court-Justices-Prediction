mr.
pickett,
may
i
just
go
back
to
an
issue
of
fact
in
your
earlier
answer?
is
the
actual
manufacturing
of
the
parts
done
primarily
by
kodak
or
primarily
by
independents?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
relative
share?
do
you
know?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
volume
an
answer...
the
buyers
who
are
sophisticated
enough
to
do
self-service
buy
lots
of
machines?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
they'd
be
losing
more,
is
what
i'm
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
leaving
aside
the
percentages,
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
found
that
you
had
presented,
and
had
not
explained
that
you
might
later
be
able
to
present
any
admissible
evidence
that
indicated
a
conspiracy
between
kodak
and
the...
either
the
25
or
the
90
percent
manufacturers.
am
i
right
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
now
did
you...
do
you
claim
that
you
had
admissible
evidence
or
indicated
that
you
could
have?
i
didn't
understand
that
from
your
brief,
but
i
may
be
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
didn't
cross-appeal
on
that,
did
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
you
cross-appeal
on
that?
