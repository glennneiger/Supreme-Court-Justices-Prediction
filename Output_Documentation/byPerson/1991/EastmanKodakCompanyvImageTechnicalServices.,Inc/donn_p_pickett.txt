mr.
donn
p.
pickett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
kodak's
lack
of
market
power
is
central
to
the
resolution
of
this
case.
kodak
lacks
market
power
because
interbrand
equipment
competition
disciplines
kodak's
conduct
in
the
derivative
after-markets
for
parts
and
service.
without
evidence
of
market
power,
respondent's
claims
fail,
and
kodak
has
no
duty
to
sell
them
parts.
kodak's
copiers
and
micrographics
equipment,
like
most
durable
goods,
require
regular
service
and
maintenance.
kodak
chose
to
provide
this
service
itself,
through
an
in-house
service
organization,
subject
to
uniform
training,
practices,
and
procedures.
kodak
did
not
have
to
choose
this
course.
it
could
have
used
independent
service
outlets,
as
many
manufacturers
do.
but
in
deciding
what
would
work
best
in
highly
competitive
interbrand
markets,
kodak
chose
an
equipment
marketing
strategy
that
would
stress
the
highest-quality
service
available
in
the
industry.
and
to
make
good
on
that
promise,
kodak
invested
in
the
best
in-house
service
organization
it
could
develop.
kodak
saw
the
rise
of
independent
service
organizations
as
a
threat
to
its
interbrand
equipment
marketing
strategy
and
to
the
investments
which
had
been
made
to
support
it.
so
when
iso's
demanded
that
kodak
provide
them
with
parts,
tools,
service
manuals,
diagnostic
equipment,
which
would
be
used
solely
to
provide
service
in
competition
with
kodak,
kodak
said
no.
it
said
what
any
competitor,
in
a
competitive
market,
ought
to
be
able
to
say
to
another
competitor.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
in
the
great
majority
of
instances,
they
are
things
that
are
manufactured
by
kodak.
in
some
small
percentage
of
times,
there
are
other
equipment
manufacturers
who
will
manufacture
a
part
for
kodak
to
be
used
in
a
copier,
or
in
a
component
of
a
micrographics
system.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
well,
unless
they
made
them
themselves,
or
unless
they
disassembled
used
equipment,
or
unless
they
sought
other
sources.
but
the
lack
of
market
power
that
kodak
has,
does
not
come
from
the
source...
availability
of
sources
to
iso's;
it
comes
from
the
interbrand
competition
and
the
effects.
also,
kodak--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--it
is
a
given,
your
honor,
absolutely.
this
was
never
challenged,
even
in
the
petitions
for
certiorari,
from
the
very
first--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--it
is
for
the
very
first
time
in
the
briefs
on
the
merit.
but
the
fact
is
the
evidence
in
the
district
court,
which,
of
course,
controls
the
resolution
in
this
case,
was
only
evidence
put
in
by
kodak.
it
was
un-rebutted
with
a
single
iota
of
evidence
by
respondents.
and
even
on
a
de
novo
review,
there
is
absolutely
no
reading
of
that
evidence.
these
are
the
declarations
of
mr.
lacy
and
mr.
murray,
that
one
could
conclude
interbrand
equipment
competition
does
not
exist.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
no,
none
whatsoever
in
the
response
to
the
petition
for
cert.--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--and
that--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--absolutely,
and
that
is
what
i
will
talk
about
today.
that
was
not
challenged
at
all
in
the
response
to
the
petition
for
cert.--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--primarily
by
kodak.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
the
relative
share
is
something
on
the
order
of
75
percent
by
kodak.
kodak
said
to
these
iso's--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--that
is
in
the
record
in
the
declarations
provided
by
kodak
in
the
summary
judgment.
kodak
said
to
the
iso's
what
any
competitor
ought
to
be
able
to
say:
we
will
not
help
you,
help
yourself.
compete
with
us
if
you
will,
but
by
making
the
same
investments
and
taking
the
same
risks
as
we
have.
this
court
has
previously
recognized,
in
gte
sylvania,
and
again
in
sharp
electronics,
that
interbrand
competition
is
at
the
core
of
vertical
restraints
analysis.
interbrand
competition
is
the
primary
concern
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
provides
a
significant
check
on
intrabrand
competition.
interbrand
competition
also
governs
the
analysis
of
this
case.
the
core
of
kodak's
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
its
evidence
that
kodak
faced
robust
interbrand
competition
in
the
markets
for
copiers
and
micrographics
equipment,
from
the
likes
of
xerox,
3m,
bell
&
howell,
canon,
minolta,
fuji,
and
a
host
of
other
japanese
manufacturers.
kodak
must
conform
its
conduct
to
the
demands
of
that
robust,
interbrand
competition.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
respondents
did
not
even
challenge
kodak's
evidence
on
interbrand
competition.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
well,
the
burden
of
proof,
of
course,
is
on
plaintiffs.
and
under
the
celotex
case,
the
fact
that
kodak
has
presented
evidence
in
its
initial
motion
for
summary
judgment
does
place
the
burden
on
them
to
come
forward
with
significant,
probative
evidence--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--well,
they
would
have
the
obligation
to
put
forward
those
affidavits.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
they
did
not
do
so.
and
therefore,
they
failed
to
meet
their
burden.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
i'm
sorry?
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
it
necessarily
means
that
the
manufacturer's
dominant...
the
answer
is
no.
it
necessarily
means--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--no,
because
the
interbrand
equipment
market
plays
a
dominant
role
on
the
derivative
after-markets
for
parts
and
service.
kodak's...
the
manufacturer's--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--that
is
undisputed,
absolutely.
kodak's
dominant
incentive
in
this
case,
to
use
the
words
of
justice
scalia
in
the
sharp
electronics
case,
is
to
sell
equipment.
and
its
dominant
incentive--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--it
wants
to
sell
as
much
of
its
total
package
of
goods,
and
therefore
it
must
price
its
total
package
of
goods
at
a
competitive
price.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
no,
no.
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--certainly
there
could
be
patented
parts.
but
even
in
the
case
of
a
patented
part,
the
competition
at
the
interbrand
equipment
level
would
offer
those
consumers
the
choices
that
they
want
in
that
market.
and
they
would
choose
among
the
various
packages
that
are
offered
by
the
various
manufacturers.
manufacturers
have
options.
they
can
choose
service
by
themselves;
they
can
choose
service
offered
by
iso's.
it's
those
options
that
can...
in
the
competitive
process...
will
win
or
fail,
as
consumers
decide.
and
as
manufacturers
like
kodak
come
up
with
product
offerings
of
equipment,
parts,
and
service,
that
are
designed
in
various
innovative
ways,
it's
the...
it's
the
manufacturer's
freedom
to
design
those
particular
packages
that
offers
the
competitive
process
to
work.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
it
is
certainly
a
law
of
economics.
it
is
also--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--all
three,
they
were
entitled
to.
the
fact
is,
they
never
sought
discovery
in
the
equipment
market
area.
but
it's
no...
they
are
not--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--well,
if
one
defines
a
separate
market,
or
attempts
to,
one
has
to
overlook
the
connection
between
interbrand
equipment
market
and
the
derivative
after-market
for
parts
and
service.
there's
no
evidence
that
could
isolate
that
parts
and
service
market
from
the
activity
going
on
in
the
equipment
market
in
this
case.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
there
is
evidence
that
there
were
some
sales
of
that.
but
the
important--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--they
were
under-cutting
the
price
at
times.
but
the
total
package
price
offered
by
kodak--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--they
were
selling...
they
were
selling
parts
and
service,
correct.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
well,
they
can
be
sold
separately,
your
honor,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
can
be
sold
in
isolation
from
the
impact
of
the
interbrand
equipment
market.
the
interbrand
equipment
market
is
the
one
in
which
the
various
product
offerings
of
manufacturers
are
tested.
kodak
chose
a
vertically
integrated
distribution
system,
for
example.
it
didn't
go
to
retail--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--no,
your
honor,
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
the
record
shows
that
iso's
developed
in
1982,
at
the
very
earliest.
they
chose
a
vertical--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--for
the
copier
market
in
1975,
when
kodak
introduced
copiers,
and
for
micrographics,
in
1985...
but
prospectively.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
yes,
but
prospectively,
for
micrographics,
so
that
it
didn't
apply
to
the
older
micrographics
equipment.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
yes,
and
parts
are
continued
to
be
sold
to
iso's
for
the
micrographics
equipment
that
was
in
existence
at
that
time.
kodak
chose
a
vertically
integrated
distribution
system.
it
didn't
have
to.
other
manufacturers
use
resellers,
for
example.
kodak
chose
a
vertically
integrated
service
offering.
other
manufacturers
chose
other
ways
to
do
it.
but
kodak's
view
was
that
it
could
provide
the
best
distribution
for
its
products,
itself.
and
that
it
could
service
those
products
best,
itself.
and
it
stressed
the
quality
of
its
service
in
marketing
the
equipment.
other
manufacturers
chose
other
strategies.
it
so
happened
that
kodak's
strategies
have
worked
well.
and
kodak's
successful
entry,
for
example,
in
the
copier
market,
a
market
dominated
by
xerox,
was
highly
procompetitive.
buyers
were
given
greater
choices;
competition
was
enhanced,
since
kodak
was
free
to
offer
its
product
offering
in
an
innovative
way.
manufacturers
should
be
free
to
offer
their
equipment
with
service
options
that
cover
the
gamut...
from
long-term
warranties,
on
the
one-hand,
included
in
the
initial
price,
to
very
low
equipment
prices,
with
higher
service
charges
down
the
road;
from
service
offered
by
manufacturers,
alone,
on
the
one
hand,
to
manufacturers
who
rely
entirely
on
independent
service
organizations.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
the
case
that
most
strongly
supports
our
position
is
sharp
electronics,
your
honor.
in
sharp
electronics,
a
price
cutter,
retailer
price
cutter,
was
terminated
in
part
due
to
the
manufacturer's
dominant
incentive
to
ensure
the
provision
of
service,
and
customer
support
at
the
retail
level.
if
that
can
be
done
in
combination
with
another
retailer,
surely
it
can
be
done
by
kodak,
itself.
in
this
case,
competition--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--that's
correct.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
absolutely.
on
this
record,
raising
the
price
of
service
and
parts
to
supercompetitive
levels,
would
have
the
same
effect
as
raising
equipment
prices.
and
kodak
would
lose
equipment
sales,
which
is
its
dominant
incentive
in
this
marketplace,
and
on
this
record.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
that
kodak
competed
with
iso's,
yes,
for
price
at
various
times.
but
that's
not
to
say
that
the
fact
that
kodak
set
a
particular
part
of
its
package...
that
is
service
in
this
instance,
at
one
level,
and
someone
could
come
in
and
undercut
that,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
total,
competitive
return
that
kodak
receive
on
equipment,
parts,
and
service,
is
not
at
a
competitive
level.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
competition
works
on
this
record,
because
kodak
is
restrained
from
charging
supercompetitive
prices
at
the
service
and
parts
levels.
if
it
charged
supercompetitive
prices,
it
would
quickly
lose
equipment
sales;
it
would
quickly
be
out
of
business.
kodak--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--excuse--
[laughter]
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
it's
just
like
that.
it's
just
like
the
cheap
financing
and
the
expensive
homes
that
were
involved
in
the
fortner
case,
in
which
this
court
ruled.
and
it's
just
like
the
razors
and
blades
that
are
brought
up
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
excuse
me?
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
yes,
and
these
are
very
sophisticated
buyers--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--it's
self-servicers
who
are
allowed
to
buy
the
parts.
they
are
not
necessarily--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--no,
they
are
simply
the
ones
who
use
the
most
equipment.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
you
go
through
a
kodak
training
program.
if
there
are--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--yes,
absolutely.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
clear
up
one
point,
with
respect
to
your
question
concerning
affirmative
defenses
and
burden.
market
power
is
an
essential
element
of
both
respondents'
tying
claim,
and
their
monopolization
claims.
as
an
essential
element,
respondents
had
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
element.
there
is--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--certainly,
every
monopolization
and
market
power...
jefferson
parish
for
tying,
and
aspen
or
any
other
monopolization
case,
says
that
there
must
be
the
requisite
economic
power
on
the
part
of
respondents.
now,
kodak
presented
evidence
on
this
case,
first
of
significant,
robust,
interbrand
equipment
competition
in
its
declarations.
second,
that
buyers--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--sure.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
no,
he's
left
out
the
japanese
manufacturers,
who
are
significant.
canon--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--back
in
1986,
they
represented
in
the
high-volume
segment
of
copiers,
approximately
10
percent;
in
the
lower-volume
areas,
they
were
the
dominant
competitors,
along
with
xerox.
kodak
presented
evidence
of
interbrand
competition.
it
presented
evidence
that
the
sophisticated
buyers
take
into
account
those
future
service
and
parts
costs.
and
it
took...
and
it
presented
evidence
that
kodak
sets
its
prices
for
parts
and
service,
based
on
what
those
sophisticated
buyers
will
do
in
the
interbrand
market.
now,
in
response
to
that,
what
did
respondents
do,
and
what
more
could
kodak
have
done
to
present
its
motion
for
summary
judgment?
respondents
failed
to
take
discovery
on
market
power,
for
the
most
part,
although
they
were
given
many
opportunities
by
judge
schwarzer,
over
the
remaining
6
months
that
this
summary
judgment
motion
was
on
file.
they
didn't
rebut
that
evidence
at
all.
they
presented
a
single
theory.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
well,
they
presented
a
couple
of
anecdotes
in
declarations--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--about
incidences
in
which
they've
been
able
to
offer
service.
but
that
doesn't
begin
to
rebut
the
implausibility
of
the
case,
in
which--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--although
it
may
be
a
scintilla
of
evidence,
it's
not
the
significant,
probative
evidence
that's
required
under--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--they
didn't
present
any
evidence,
not
even
a
scintilla,
of
a
fundamental
change
in
the
workings
of
the
marketplace
that
would
separate
the
equipment
market
from
the
parts
and
service
market...
non
that
showed
how
that
would
work.
their
only
theory
was
a
lock-in
theory.
that
was
the
only
theory
they
presented
to
judge
schwarzer.
and
as
this
court
held
in
jefferson
parish,
the
proper
time
to
assess
market
power
in
that
instance
is
at
the
time
of
purchase,
since
that's
when...
that's
when
the
competing
offers
are
being
considered
by
the
purchasers.
and
co--
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
i...
on
page
293,
of
the
joint
appendix,
kodak
presents
evidence
that
it
has
over
10,000
parts
in
copiers,
and
over
20,000
parts
in
micrographics.
it
does
not
say
what
percentage,
at
that
point.
and
i'm
unable
at
this
point
to
find
that
reference.
however,
i
submit
it
makes
no
difference,
what
percentage,
whether
it's

some
inadmissible
hearsay

of
a--
mr.

p.
pickett
--part
of
the
charge
of
a
vertical...
only
arrangement
between
kodak
and
its
suppliers.
and
in
any
event,
they
have
no
market
power.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett

that
for
proprietary
information
for
kodak
parts,
it
would
not
be
provided.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
no,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
mr.
donn
p.
pickett
one
is
that
it's
a
vertical
arrangement
only.

mr.

event,
there'd
be
no
market
power.
mr.
donn
p.
