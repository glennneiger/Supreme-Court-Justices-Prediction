mr.
james
a.
hennefer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
questions
of
the
court
and
mr.
pickett
and
mr.
rill's
response,
highlight
the
fundamental
problem
with
kodak's
case:
that
is,
that
there
are
hotly
contested,
factually
disputed
issues
which
plaintiffs
should
be
allowed
to
proceed
on.
let's
take
some
of
these
issues.
the
market
power
in
the
basic
equipment
market
is
hotly
debated.
you
look
just
at
the
admissions,
the
declarations
of
kodak's--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--well,
because
this
was
one
of
many
factors,
and
we
didn't
consider
it
the
most
important
factor
on
why
the...
why
power
in
the
basic
equipment
market
does
not
discipline
prices
and
power
in
the
parts
and
service
markets.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
we
didn't
feel
that
this
was
fundamental
to
defending
the
judgment
in
the
ninth
circuit,
as--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
well,
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--yes,
it
proceeded
that
there
was
some
market
share
and
some
market
power.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
there
was
an
issue,
your
honor,
presented
in
kodak's
own
declarations
as
to
whether--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--yes,
we
are
arguing
that--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--we
don't
have
to
have
that
argument.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
well,
no,
we
have
not
made
a
concession
to
kodak.
they
have--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--yes.
this
court--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--mr....
yes.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
well,
we
did
not
contest
the
issue
of
market
power
because
it
was
not
essential
to
our
case...
market
power,
that
is,
in
the
equipment
market.
this
court,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
however,
is
entitled
to
make
a
de
novo
review
of
the
record
and
all
facts
that
are
on
the
record.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
okay.
um,
other--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--other
issues
of
fact
which
are
hotly
contested,
and
were
at
the
district
court
as
well,
are
whether
parts
are
manufactured
by
kodak
or
by
outside
vendors.
mr.
pickett
stated
that
it
was
a
75
percent/25
percent
ratio.
our
declarations
show
that
it's
a
10
percent/90
percent
ratio...
kodak
manufacturing
only
10
percent
of
the
parts.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
an
interrogatory
was
asked
to
kodak
on
this,
and
they
refused
to
answer
it.
and
the
district
court
refused
to
allow
a
motion
to
compel
the
answer
on
that
particular
issue.
mr.
pickett
stated
another
factual
issue,
and
that
was
that
kodak
took
all
service
for
its
equipment
in-house.
that
is
not
the
case.
that's
a
hotly
contested
factual
issue.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
we
put
evidence
on
the
record,
yes,
they
could,
but
that
we
tried
to
buy
those
parts.
and
the
evidence
shows
that
the
oem's
said
kodak
will
not
allow
us
to
sell
them
to
you.
kodak's
own
documents
say
that
they
have
instructed
these
people
not
to
sell
them
to
us.
we
have--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--the
district--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--the
district
court
ignored
that
evidence,
said
that
that
evidence
was
not
admissible
evidence,
even
though
in--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--yes,
that
was
the
finding.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
no,
we
contested...
we
do
contest
this
issue,
because
we
contest
that
kodak
did
not
control
the
parts
market.
and
control
of
the
parts
market,
and
the
ability
to
control
price
and
people
in
that
marketplace
involves
a
question
of
whether
you
can
get
outside
supply
sources.
and
that
issue
was
clearly
raised
by
us.
whether
there
is
a
parts
market,
and
whether
kodak
has
power
in
that
parts
market,
has,
as
an
essential
component,
whether
or
not
you
can
get
source
of
supply,
as
well
as
whether
higher
prices
will
allow
you
to
substitute
under
the
dupont
rule
of
substitutability,
whether
there's
price
substitutability
or
whether
there's
demand
substitutability.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
yes.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
that
is--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--that
is
correct.
if
there's
a
one-to-one
correlation
or
a
close
to
one-to-one
correlation
between
raising
the
prices
in
the
equipment
market,
and...
or
in
the
parts
market
and
people
not
buying
equipment,
that's
correct.
but
of
course
it's
our
primary
contention
here,
that
that
kind
of
a
per
se
rule
of
immunity
should
not
be
accepted.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
well,
it's
more
than
a
norm.
they
want
to
say
once
a
defendant
comes
up
with
proof
that
there
is
competition
in
the
basic
equipment
market,
then
the
case
is
over.
because
you
cannot,
as
a
matter
of
law,
then,
in
the
parts
or
service
market,
have
any
market
power
or
dominance
of
those
markets.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
your
honor,
in
fact,
we
did
come
up
with
substantial
record
evidence
of
this.
it's
kodak
who
did
not
come
up
with
any
record
evidence.
let
me
give
you
a
few
examples.
we
came
up
with
evidence
of
a
purchaser,
a
copy
shop,
mr.
hernandez,
who
buys
photocopy
machines
and
who
is
aware
of
the
price
of
service,
because
he
also
was
giving
some
outside
service...
who
bought
kodak's
machines
knowing
that
they
were
charging
two
to
three
times
the
price
that
a
private
servicer
would
charge
for
it.
in
that
situation,
certainly
it's
hard
evidence
that
a
knowing
purchaser
takes
something
else
into
account
besides
the
cost
of
the
parts
or
service.
let
me
give
a--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--okay.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
if
there's
no
record
evidence
as
to
the
cost
of
the
machine.
kodak
has
not
come
forward.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
justice
scalia,
in
other
situations...
if
i
may
give
a
few
more
examples.
for
example,
the
purchasers
of
the
federal
government,
one
group
on
a
capital
budget
will
purchase
machines
without
any
regard
to
how
the
service
for
those
machines
are
going
to
be
paid
for.
that
will
then
be
given
to
a
particular
department.
and
then
that
department,
on
its
operating
budget,
has
to
pay
for
those...
that
service.
now
there's
a
totally
separate
situation:
one
purchaser
for
the
machines,
who
is
not
taking
into
account
the
cost
of
service.
how
can
you
say,
in
this
case,
there
would
be
a
one-to-one
correlation?
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
exactly.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
yes...
yes,
we
did.
this
is
justice
stevens'
point,
and
a
very
good
one.
and
that
is,
that
kodak,
where
they
have
very
sophisticated
buyers
like
top
copy
in
boston,
which
have
several
photocopy
machines,
would
allow
them
to
self-service.
there's
a
sophisticated
buyer
who's
saying
i'd
like
to
buy
the
machine,
but
your
service
is
high,
so
they're
allowed
to
self-service.
and
then
kodak
did
something
even
more
with
top
copy--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--no...
well,
any
buyer--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--any
buyer
who
came
to
them,
sophisticated
enough
to
say
i
will...
i
will
have
my
own
self-service.
and
this
self-service
is
going
to
be
cheaper
than
kodak's.
i'd
like
to
buy
the
machine,
but
i
don't
want
to
pay
the
high
price.
they
even
offered
top
copy...
and
this
is
record
evidence...
a
block
of
service
at
a
lower
rate
than
they
normally
sell
it
to
other
people,
because
top
copy
was
going
to
service
their
own
machines,
and
they
were
going
to
lose
$
300,
000
worth
of
service
business.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
we...
chief
justice
rehnquist,
we
have
come
forward
with
specific
facts
in
this
marketplace
that
show...
and
it's...
the
burden
is
on
us,
initially,
to
come
forward
with
specific
facts
on
the
record.
after
that,
kodak
has
to
come
forward
with
specific
facts
on
their
affirmative
defense...
if
they
want
to
prove
an
affirmative
defense...
to
show
that
that
works,
which
they
haven't
done.
we
have,
in
fact--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--this
comes
by
way
of
an
affirmative
defense,
because
we
have
shown,
under
80
years
of
antitrust
jurisprudence,
that
we
have
section
1
sherman
and
section
2
sherman
violations.
ah--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--that's
correct,
on
the...
on
that
issue.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
yes.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
that's
correct.
it's
up
to--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--yes,
that
is...
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
no,
they
came
forward
with
affidavits
that
showed
that
they
had
substantial
percentages
in
two
or
three
markets,
which
they
defined
as
such.
their
own
admissions
show
some
power.
but
on
the
next
issue
of
whether
that
power...
or
lack
of
power...
in
the
basic
equipment
markets
transfers
over
to
the
parts
and
service
markets,
they
came
forward
with
only
a
single
blanket
statement
that...
saying
generally
consumers
consider
the
costs.
it
doesn't...
and
they...
they
offered
a
trade
journal
article
that
said
here
are
the
factors
you
need
to
consider
when
buying
a
photocopy
machine,
which
included
not
just
cost...
which
they
didn't
give
a
specific
number
for
but
which
included
features
of
the
machine,
and
the
name
of
the
company,
and
all
of
the
other
factors
as
pointed
out
in
the
public
citizens'
brief,
that...
that
customers
consider
when
they're
buying
a
machine.
you
cannot
know,
on
buying
one
of
these
machines,
what
the
cost
of
the
service
is
going
to
be
for
the
life
of
the
machine.
kodak
only
gives
a
1-year
warranty.
these
are
at
least
7-year
life
machines.
we
came
forward
with
evidence
that
showed
there
was
no
connection
between
power
in
the
interbrand
market
and
power
in
the
parts
and
service
market,
that
specific
evidence,
in
fact,
showed
that
while
kodak
was
charging
supercompetitive
prices...
two
and
three
times
competitive
prices
for
parts
and
service...
kodak
was
not
losing
the
customers.
if
kodak's
theory
were
true,
they
ought
to
be
losing
the
customers
in
the
equipment
market,
when
they're
pricing
supercompetitively
in
the
parts
and
service
market.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
but
if
they
were
selling
the
equipment
very
cheaply,
why
would
they
allow
self-servicers?
because
they
would
be
losing
money
on
the
equipment,
and
they
could
no
gain
it
back
in
the
service
market,
from
the
people
who
were
self-servicing.
they'd
lose
it
both
ways.
it
doesn't
make--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
but
if
they're
buying
lots
of
machines,
they
would
be
losing
lots
of
money
under
justice
scalia's
particular
scenario.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
well,
certainly
it
doesn't
make
sense
that
kodak
would
be
losing
money
on
the
machines,
and
then
also
letting
somebody
self-service,
so
they
couldn't
regain
the
money
on
the
service.
and,
in
fact,
kodak
has
come
forward
with
no
evidence
that
they
are
pricing
these
machines
below
cost.
in
fact,
their
declarations
say
we
price
these
machines
in
the
marketplace
the
same
way
our
competitors
do.
another
issue
that--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--in
a
situation
where
consumers
are
benefitting
the
most
in
a
vertically
integrated
distribution
network,
each
item
in
that
network
ought
to
be
priced
with
relation
to
marginal
cost.
it
is
not
in
the
best
consumer
welfare
to
allow
somebody
to
have
a...
control
over
a
derivative
market.
for
example,
kodak
does
make
this
argument,
that
we're
entitled
to
the
profits
in
these
derivative
markets.
does
that
mean
that
automobile
manufacturers
are
entitled
to
the
profits
in
the
gasoline
market,
because
gasoline
was
required
to
have
an
automobile
go.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
it
isn't.
i
think
in
that
case,
justice
scalia,
you're
correct.
that...
for
example,
the
subaru
automobile
in
the
grappone
case.
in
order
to
break
into
the
market
with
a
very
small
market
share,
and
a
very
small,
installed
base,
it
makes
very
good
sense
for
a
competitor
to
say
i'm...
i'm
not
only
going
to
price
the
car
low,
i'm
also
going
to
try
to
keep
the
service
and
parts
in-house.
that's
not
our
case
here.
we
have
a
situation
where
kodak
has,
in
some
markets,
over
50
percent
of
the
market
share,
and
has
significant
enough
power
to
be
able
to
continue
to
sell
the
basic
equipment,
yet
charge
two
to
three
times
the
competitive
price
for
parts
and
service.
what
we're
seeing
here
in
this
case,
on
the
small
record
we
have,
is
that
kodak
is
able
to
do
this.
in
the
1985
through
1987
period,
kodak
was
gaining
market
share
in
the
photocopy
sales.
yet,
they
were
charging,
as
we
see
on
the
face
of
the
record,
from
our
declarations,
two
to
three
times,
for...
to
the
state
of
california,
what
the
competitive
rate
of
service
was.
now,
they
shouldn't
be
gaining
market
share
under
that
circumstance.
they
should
be
losing
customers
by
the
droves.
the
same
in
the
micrographics
area.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
certainly,
if
they
were
pricing
the
equipment
very
low,
which
there's
no
evidence
of
at
all.
and
that's
kodak's
burden
on
that,
to
come
forward
with
the
evidence
that
shows
that
that's
how
they
were
pricing,
that
that's
how
they're
going
to
defend
this
action,
that
there
is
a
connection,
a
good,
solid
connection,
that
allows
a
per
se...
in
effect,
per
se
rule,
when
you
show
competition
in
the
basic
equipment
market,
but
you
can't
have
markets
or
market
power
in
the
service
and
parts
market.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
well,
kodak
wasn't
doing
this
in
this
case,
and
to
apply
a
theory
that
is
contradictory
to
the
facts
presented
by
plaintiffs
in
a
case,
is,
in
effect,
matsushita.
the
matsushita
situation
is
100
miles
from
this
situation.
they
are
polar
opposites.
in
matsushita,
consumers
were
getting
low
prices.
and
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
were
saying
wait.
consumer
welfare
will
be
hurt.
prices
will
go
up.
here,
the
prices
are
high.
and
kodak
is
saying,
wait.
trust
us.
we
can't
be
doing
this,
but
if
we
are,
it
will
be...
suicidal.
moreover,
in
the
matsushita
case,
this
was
decided
on
an
extensive
record,
with
the
third
circuit
having
reviewed
all
of
the
evidence
on
a
pretrial,
just
basic...
at
the
edge
of
trial
type
of
evidence.
and
it
was
fully
explored,
whether
there
was
a
connection
between
the
economic
theory
and
the
realities
of
the
marketplace.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
there
have
been
material
issues
of
fact
that
have
been
raised...
very
substantial
material
issues
of
fact...
and
controverted.
we
have...
we
have
shown
how
consumers
behave.
we
have
shown
how
consumers
buy
new
equipment
without
considering
the
costs
of
the
life
cycle
of
that
equipment.
we
have
shown
that
consumers...
that
a
company
may,
with
a
small
market
share,
price
that
equipment,
and
tie
it
to
parts
without
the
problems
that
we
have.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
yes,
there
is.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
yes,
kodak...
kodak,
in
order
to
keep
those
parts
from
getting
to
the
service
companies
that
were
competing
fiercely
with
them,
did
a
number
of
things.
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
go
to
their
original
equipment
parts
manufacturers
and
say
don't
sell
them
to
these
iso's
so
they
can't
have
parts.
the
second
thing
they
did
was
to
say--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--well,
it
is
not
making
these
parts;
90
percent
of
these...
at
least
we
have
presented
record
evidence
that
90
percent
of
these
parts
are
made
by
outside
people.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
kodak
then
has
to
go
to
these
people
and
make
an
agreement
with
them.
and
there's
an
agreement
there,
at
least
a
rule
of
reason
agreement...
a
conspiracy,
if
you
will...
evidence
of
that
agreement.
they
didn't...
excuse
me,
justice
white.
they
did
several
other
things
in
addition
to
that.
they
went
to
people
they
sold
parts
to
and
said
we
will
sell
you
these
parts,
so
long
as
you
don't
let
an
iso
get
a
hold
of
them
so
they
can
compete.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
yes.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
the
agreement,
at
least
from
what
we
were
able
to
see
in
the
record
of
it,
and
there's
a
kodak
document
that
says
that
they
told
acme
electric
not
to
sell
those
parts
to
the
iso
who
was
trying
to
get
those
parts.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
no.
it
was
our
understanding
on
this
meager
record,
that
10
percent
of
the
parts
are
made
by
kodak,
not
75
percent.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
the
actual
parts.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
yes,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
that
is
correct.
and
that's
in
one
of
the
declarations.
and
specific...
to
specifically
pin
this
down,
we
asked
an
interrogatory
that
asked
for
kodak
to
give
us
a
list
of
the
parts
for
photocopy
machines,
and
to
specify
which
of
those
parts
were
manufactured
by
kodak,
and
which
of
those
parts
were
manufactured
by
oem's,
to
pin
it
down.
kodak
refused
to
answer
that.
the
district
judge
refused
to
allow
us
to
make
a
motion
to
compel
that.
and
so
we
don't
have
the
benefit
of
kodak's
own,
inside
information
on
that.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
number...
my
understanding
was
in
number
of
parts,
actual
parts.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
yes,
the
district
court
looked
at--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--yes,
we
did.
we
presented
a
rule
56(f)
motion,
which
said
we
are
presenting
evidence
from
our
plaintiffs,
that
they
have
approached
these
oem
companies
and
asked
them.
and,
if
given
the
opportunity
to
take
the
depositions
that
we
would
like
of
these
companies,
then
that
hearsay
evidence
could
be
converted
to
admissible
evidence.
and
that
was
refused.
we
were
allowed,
initially,
four,
and
then
an
additional
two...
so
a
total
of
six
depositions
and
chose,
because
of
the
limited
focus--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--did
not
cross-appeal?
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
yes,
we
did.
we
raised
the
issue
that
there
was
insufficient
discovery,
and
that
that
insufficient
discovery
did
not
allow
us
sufficient
opportunity
to
prove
that
issue.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
i
don't
recall
a
statement
like
that
in
the
record,
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
as
was
lodged
with
the
court,
and
the
court
was
asked
to
take
judicial
notice
of
it,
xerox,
who
is
kodak's
main...
actual
only...
competitor
now,
virtually
their
only
competitor...
there
is
a
duopoly
in
high-speed
copiers...
initially,
in
1987...
up
until
1987...
had
a
policy
where
they
would
allow
iso's.
and
we
presented
record
evidence...
that
on
the
basis
of
that,
xerox's
prices
for
an
equivalent
machine
to
kodak's,
for
service,
for
a
yearly
contract,
were
one-third
of
what
kodak's
services
were.
xerox,
after
kodak,
adopted
its
policy
in
cutting
off
parts,
and
putting
iso
servicers
in
the
photocopy
business,
out
of
business...
adopted
the
same
policy
that
kodak
adopted,
in
the
united
states
and
canada.
and
the
equivalent
of
the
federal
trade
commission
in
canada
took
exception
with
this
and
ruled
against
xerox
and
said
that
xerox
cannot
monopolize
and
cut
off
these
parts
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
this
was
not
before
the
trial
court.
it
occurred
after
the
summary
judgment
motion.
and
we
have
lodged
that,
and
requested
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
it.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
it
was
not
before
the
trial
court.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
some
of
the
facts,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
were
before
the
trial
court.
the
fact
that
xerox
was
competitive
on
service
was
before
the
trial
court.
it's
in
a
declaration.
the
fact
that
xerox
was
charging
one-third,
under
a
freely
competitive
market,
of
what
kodak
was
charging
for
service,
was
before
the
district
court.
the
fact
that
xerox
then
changed
its
policy,
which
occurred
after
1987,
was
not
before
the
trial
court.
and
the
fact
of
the
canadian
federal
trade
commission
was
not
before
the
trial
court,
either.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
yes,
it
does.
kodak's
own
admissions,
their
own
declarations,
which
we
depend
on
for
factual
evidence
on
the
market
power
issue,
shows
that
there
were
primarily
three,
in
the
marketplace
for
high-speed
copiers:
xerox,
kodak,
and
ibm.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
about
30
percent.
and
we
have
submitted
to
the
court,
and
asked
for
judicial
notice,
that
since
the
district...
since
the
district
court
opinion,
kodak
has
acquired
xerox,
and
it's
now
over
50
percent
market
share
in
the
high-speed
copier
market.
they
acquired
ibm,
so
it's...
kodak
acquired
ibm
and
it's
now
just
kodak--
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
--yes,
and
xerox...
part,
yes,
i'm
terribly
sorry.
[laughter]
they're
big,
but
not
that
big,
yet.
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
adopt
a
per
se
rule
of
legality,
or
at
least
one
that
gives
a
presumption
to
kodak
and
immunize
kodak
and
other
basic
equipment
manufacturers
from
section
1
and
section
2
sherman
violations.
i
don't
think
you
should
do
so
in
light
of
this
court's
experience
with
the
trilogy
of
cases
in
white
motor
and
schwinn,
and
in
gte
sylvania.
i
don't
think
this
court
should
do
so
in
light
of
the
profoundly
regulatory
intervention
into
the
service
market
that
this
kind
of
an...
immunization
from
section
1
and
section
2
sherman
would
put
into
effect.
mr.
james
a.
hennefer
i
thank
the
court.
