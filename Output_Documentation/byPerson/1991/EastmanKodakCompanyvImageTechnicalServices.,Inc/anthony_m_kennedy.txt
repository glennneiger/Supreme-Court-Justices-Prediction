justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
do
we
know?
this
is
a
law
of
nature
or
a
law
of
economics?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
this
case
comes
up
to
us
after
very
little
discovery.
and
it
just
seems
hard
for
me
to,
i
would
imagine,
writing
an
opinion
setting
forth
all
the
propositions
you
make,
without
some
factual
background
to
support
what
i'm...
what
you're
saying.
your
honor,
we
put
in
a
fully
detailed,
factual
background,
in
our
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
fact
is,
that
that
was
not
rebutted
at
all
by
respondents.
moreover,
as
to
discovery,
judge
schwarzer
told
respondents
that
they
should
go
out
and
take
discovery
on
the
issue
of
market
power,
which
is
what
we're
arguing
about
today.
they
took
extended
depositions.
they
took
complete
document
discovery.
they
went
back
to
judge
schwarzer
and
he
allowed
them
more
depositions--
--market
power
in
the
equipment
sales
area
or
in
the
parts
and
service
area...
or
all
three?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it,
their
theory
of
the
case
is
they
don't
have
to,
because
there's
a
separate
market
for
parts
and
services.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
wasn't
there
evidence
in
the
record
that
kodak
sometimes
charged
twice
as
much
for
its
service
as
iso's?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
that's
consistent
with
your
earlier
concession
that
there's
a
separate
market
for
parts.
what
is
it,
in
your
view,
that's
the
bare
minimum
that
these
plaintiffs
would
have
had
to
show
to
survive
summary
judgment
in
this...
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
disagree
with
that.
if
we
say
that
the
parts
and
the
service
market
are
separate
markets,
as
to
which
a
separate
standard
of
competitive
conduct
is
required;
then
must
we
reverse?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought
we
were
proceeding
on
the
assumption...
for
argument
purposes...
that
there
was
a
separate
market
in
parts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
a
little
bit
more
about
percentages?
my
understanding
from
the
petitioner
was
that
75
percent
of
the
parts,
i
think,
in
question...
i'll
interpolate
that...
were
made
by
kodak.
is...
so,
are
the
90
percent
of
the
parts
that
you're
referring
to
90
percent
of
that
25
percent
balance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ten
percent
of
all
parts--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
are
sold
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
owners
of
equipment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
are
we
talking
about
95
percent
in
terms
of
dollar
volume,
or
in
terms
of
the
actual
number
of
components?
