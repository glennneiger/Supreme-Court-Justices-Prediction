justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
didn't
make
an
issue
out
of
it
before
them,
apparently.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
defending...
are
you
defending
the...
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
its
rationale?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
need
this
other
argument,
then,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
you
finish,
could
you
give...
just
tell
me
what
your
theory
is
about...
on
the
monopolization
issue?
i
take
it
there
still
is
an
issue
of
monopolization
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
charge
is
that
kodak
is
monopolizing
the
market
for
its
own
parts?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
a
theory
that
they're...
a
company
can
monopolize
the
market
for
its
own
parts
that
it
makes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
they
are?
nevertheless,
kodak
sells
them
as
their
parts.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
i
know.
i
know
that.
what
was
the...
what...
did
they
have
an
agreement
with
their...
with
the
suppliers
of
parts
to
kodak?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was...
what
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
acme
electric
was
supplying
parts
to
kodak?
justice
byron
r.
white
you...
you
and
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
have
quite
a
different
notion
about
what
percentage
of
the
parts
that
kodak
makes
and
what
percentage
does
it
buy.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
75
percent;
he
says
10
percent.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
your
time
is
up,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--was
there
a
charge
that
kodak
had
an
arrangement
or
an
agreement
with
the...
its
parts
suppliers
not
to
sell
to
iso's?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
part
of
the
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
ask
you
whether...
is
there
a
charge
that
you
had
an
arrangement
with
your
parts
suppliers
not
to
sell
to
iso's?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that...
let's
assume
that
they
could
prove
that
you
had
this
arrangement
with
your
parts'
suppliers
not
to
sell
to
iso's.
you
would
be
in
sort
of
a
lot
of
trouble,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
agree
with
that.
but
you
are...
have
an
agreement
with
somebody
else
to
exclude
somebody
from
the
service
market.
