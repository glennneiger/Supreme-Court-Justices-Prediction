justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
take
the
position
that
it
necessarily
follows
that
if
there
was
competition
in
the
equipment
market,
that
there
could...
the
same
degree
of
competition
in
the
parts
market?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
argument
about
the
original
equipment
market
necessarily
mean
that
there's
the
same
amount
of
competition
in
the
parts
market?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
shouldn't
we
focus
our
attention
on
the
parts
market?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
undisputed
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
also
wants
to
sell
parts,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that
argument.
but
are
you
saying
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
fact
that
there's
competition
in
the...
well,
you
are,
i
guess...
in
the
original
equipment
market,
means
there's
an
equal
amount
of
competition
in
the
parts
market?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
conceivable
that
there
could
be,
say,
patented
parts,
for
example,
which
there
could
be
no
competition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
certainly
is.
there's
evidence...
as
i
understand
the
record...
that
there
were
independent
organizations
that
sold
parts
and
services
separately
from
your
company,
for
a
period
of
time,
until
you
changed
your
policy.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
a
substantial
sales,
at
a
competitive...
they
were
under-cutting
your
price,
weren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
weren't
selling
the
total
package.
they
were
selling
parts
and
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
can
be...
at
least
conceivably,
that's
evidence
that
indicates
they
can
be
sold
separately
from
the
original
equipment,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
before
it
made
that
choice,
there
were
these
separate
competitors
out
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
did...
when
did
you
adopt
the
policy
at
issue
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there's
a
3-year
period
where
there
was
a
history
of
competition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i'm
just...
it
was
3
years
in
one
of
your
products.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pickett,
maybe
you're
right
as
a
matter
of
policy.
what
is...
what
case
do
you
think
supports
your
position
from
this
court,
most
strongly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
your
argument
make
the
assumption
that
the
buyers
are
all
just
as
well
informed
about
the
long-range
costs
as
eastman
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
your
basic
argument
make
the
assumption
that
the
buyers
are
as
well
informed
in
the
long
range
about
costs...
price
of
costs
and
service
of
its
equipment
as
you
are?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why,
then,
do
you...
why
then,
do
you
allow
the
most
sophisticated
customers
who
are
able
to
service
their
own
equipment
to
buy
the
parts,
whereas
you
don't
allow
the
less-sophisticated
ones--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
aren't
they
presumably
the
most
sophisticated
customers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
can
anybody
fix
this
equipment,
or
don't
you
have
to
have
a
fairly
sophisticated
engineering
department?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
give
that
training
program
to
your
customers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rill,
the
issue
wasn't
whether
there
was
competition
in
the
equipment
market.
the
issue
is
whether
market
power
in
the
parts
market.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
is
that?
why
is
it
that...
is
it
conceivable
they
have
market
power
in
the
parts
market?
how
do
you
define
them?
what
is
your
definition
of
the
relevant
market
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
parts
market
can?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
not
impossible,
you
said
implausible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it
has
market
power
in
the
parts
market.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
all
customers
do
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
only
a
few
customers
did
it.
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would,
if
all
the
customers
are
fully
informed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
tell
us
how
many
customers
make
that
assessment,
how
many--
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a...
i
always
hate
cases
where
lawyers
can't
agree
on
what
the
record
contains.
do
you
agree
that
your
opponent
has
something
in
the
record
that
says
that
75
percent
of
the
parts
are
made
by
original...
by
kodak
rather
than
original
equipment--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
other
question?
in
the
other
70
percent
of
this
industry...
assuming
the
figures
are
as
your
opponent
describes
them...
what
do
most
of
the
competitors
do?
do
they
follow
a
similar
policy
like
kodak,
or
do
they
allow
independents
to
get
into
the
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you've
also
said
they're
a
duopoly.
does
the
record
tell
us,
as
of
the
date
of
the
rulings...
forgetting,
for
a
moment,
the
subsequent
lodgings...
how
many
companies
made
up
the
other
70
percent
of
the
market?
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
xerox
and
ibm
were
70
percent,
and
kodak
was
20
or
30
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
acquired
part
of
ibm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
sir--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
agree
with
his
characterization
of
the
remainder
of
the
market?
is
it
just
two
or
three
other
companies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
percentage
do
they
represent?
do
they
show?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
question?
they
didn't
offer
theoretical
evidence.
but
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
kind
of
folksy
evidence,
that,
in
fact,
the
service
was
less
expensive,
provided
by
the
competitors,
and
that
sort
of
things,
at
pages
10
and
11
in
their
opinion.
does
that
evidence...
is
that
evidence
at
least
raise
an
issue
of
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
if
those
were
typical
examples,
and
if
the
competitors'
prices
were
roughly
half
of
yours,
isn't
that
some...
at
least
a
scintilla
of
evidence
that
maybe
there
was
some
market
power
in
the
service
market?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
question
goes
as
to
how
much
weight
to
give
to
that
evidence,
not
whether
there's
any
there
at
all.
