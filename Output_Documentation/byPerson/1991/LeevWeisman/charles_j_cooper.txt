mr.
charles
j.
cooper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
1989
graduation
ceremony
of
the
nathan
bishop
middle
school
in
providence,
rhode
island,
rabbi
leslie
gutterman
opened
the
exercise
with
an
invocation...
one
characterized
by
the
district
court
as
an
example
of
elegant
simplicity,
thoughtful
content,
and
sincere
citizenship.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
the
graduates
themselves,
were
graduating
from
middle
school
and
into
high
school.
so
they
were
just
completing
their
eighth
grade.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i'm
sorry,
i
could
not
hear
you.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
rabbi
gutterman's
invocation...
and
he
gave
a
benediction
which
contained
a
similar
reference
to
god...
he
opened
the
ceremony
with
the
statement,
god
of
the
free,
hope
of
the
brave.
the
district
court
concluded
that
that
reference
to
the
deity
constituted
an
endorsement
of
religion,
and
therefore
violated
the
second
prong
of
this
court's
three-part
test
under
the
lemon
case.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
the
injunction
runs
to
the
public
schools
in
providence--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--and
it
includes
certain
high
schools,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
the
graduates
generally
are
in
the
18-year-old
range,
yes,
your
honor.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
concession
of
counsel
for
respondents
concluded
that
if
the
invocation
and
benediction
had
been
recast
to
omit
reference
to
god
that
it
would
have
been
constitutionally
unobjectionable.
so
the
courts
enjoined
the
providence
school
committee
from
encouraging
or
authorizing
future
graduation
ceremonies
to
include
references
to
god,
or
prayers
including
references
to
god.
we
submit
that
if
the
courts
below
were
correct,
that
if
the
establishment
clause
forbids
the
governmental
expression
of
religious
sentiments
in
a
traditional
civic
ceremony
of
this
kind,
then
rabbi
gutterman's
elegantly
simple
reference
to
god
pales
as
a
constitutional
threat,
when
compared
with
the
opening
ritual
of
this
court
that
we
have
just
witnessed.
we
certainly
believe
that
it
cannot
compare
with
opening
congressional
sessions,
and
state
legislative
sessions
with
prayer,
as
is
practiced
in
congress,
and
was
upheld
by
this
court
in
marsh
against
chambers.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
your
honor
it
is.
in
fact,
we
would
concede
that
that
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
nature
and
setting
of
either
a
graduation
ceremony
or
a
classroom
prayer,
or
prayer
as
expressed
by
this
court's--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
to
the
contrary,
we
think
that
we
would
offer
the
following
analytical
framework
for
determining
whether
or
not
governmental
expression
of
religious
beliefs
is
coercive.
the
first--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--the
very
same
prayer,
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
question
would
have
to
be,
is
exposure
to
the
government's
religious
belief
or
religious
expression
voluntary?
is
it
truly
voluntary,
or
is
it
forced
upon
the
individual
through
some--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
it's,
it's...
it's
voluntary
here
because
the
parties
have
stipulated
to
that
fact.
there's
a
stipulation.
there
was
no
factual
dispute
over
whether
it's
voluntary.
now,
in
a
different
case,
there
may
well
be
a
graduation
ceremony
in
which
it
was
not
voluntary,
where--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
that
is
the
case
by
stipulation
in
this
case
before
you.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
such--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
think
that
one...
i
think
that
one
can
make
out
a
very
serious
argument
to
just
that
effect.
and
it
would
not
be--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
that's
true.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
your
honor,
yes,
if...
if
it
is...
if
it
is
that
the
government's
religious
expression
is
forced
upon
the
individual,
then
you
must
assess
the
nature
and
the
setting
of
that
expression,
and--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--that's...
that
is
the
point.
and
the
circumstances
in
which
the
court's
opening
prayer
is
expressed
are
in
no
way
coercive.
and
in
that
regard--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--no,
to
the
contrary,
your
honor,
i
think
the
classroom
setting
is
much
distinguishable.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
fact.
and
i
do
not
know.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
ah,
there's...
there's
no
indication
that
that
was
the
case.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
a
sectarian
prayer
would,
per
se,
be
coercive.
i
think,
however,
that
the
more
theologically
specific
an
invocation
is,
or
a
prayer
is,
the
more
likely
it
is
to
be
coupled
with
coercive
elements.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--i
don't
believe
that
it
would,
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
that,
i
think
would
be
an
extreme
example...
one
that
would--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
again,
that
might
well
be
the
kind
of
extreme
example
that
justice
kennedy
referenced
in
allegheny
county...
exhortations
of
religiosity
that
amounts
to
proselytization.
i
think
that
may
well
cross
the
threshould
of
mere
expression
to
coercion.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
think
that
one
can
imagine
and
can
hypothesize
extreme
examples...
examples
that
would,
indeed,
cross
the
threshould
from
religious
expression
to
coercion.
i
don't
think
that
it
is--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
your
honor,
the
statement
from
the
podium
may
be
accompanied
by
various
exhortations
such
as
justice
kennedy
has
referenced,
to
actually
participate
through
visible
means
of
assent.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
that
may
well
be
true,
and
i
don't
think
please
stand
would
probably
rise
to
the
level.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
am
not
making
the
argument...
and
i
do
not
make
the...
the
argument
that
merely
adding
sectarian
references
to
the
prayer
is
going
to
make
it
more
coercive.
i
simply
suggest
that
one
should
be
alerted
when
that
happens
to
the
more
likely
prospect
that
the
government
is
in--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--in
that
case--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--not
necessarily
endorsing,
no.
i
don't
think
that...
but
rather
that
it
is
actually
engaged
in
an
effort
to
coerce,
engaged
in
exhortation
to
religiosity.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--i
don't
think
we
would
put
that
on
the
coins,
but
i
think
that
is
because,
at
this
stage,
that
would
not
be
politically
possible,
because--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
in
1983
the
congress
passed
a
joint
resolution
that
declared
the
year
of
the
bible.
and
in
that
resolution,
the
congress
said
that
the
bible
is
the
word
of
god.
the
president
issued
that
proclamation.
that
is
a
sectarian
proclamation.
i
don't
think
that
violates
the
establishment
clause.
and
i
don't
think
it
does
anymore
than
in
god
we
trust,
our
nation's
motto.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
if
it
is
purely
coercive--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--if
it
is
purely
noncoercive,
then
i
have
a
difficult
time
distinguishing
that
from
the
proclamation
that
i've
just
cited,
the
year
of
the
bible.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
light
of
the
rule
of
law
that
we
believe,
the
founding
fathers
established
in
the
establishment
clause,
some
finding
of
government
coercion
of
religious
sentiment
is
necessary
to
make
out
a
violation.
so
your
hypothetical
is
not
the--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--we
are
quite
frank--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--in
our
request
that
you
re-examine
at
least
lemon's
applicability
to
the
context
of
government
expression
in
symbology.
but
it
is
not--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
your
honor,
the
creche
is
sectarian,
the
menorah
is
sectarian.
and
those
are--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--oh,
no,
by
no
means,
your
honor.
but
i
do
think
that
the
establishment
clause
under
this
court's
uniform
holdings
protects
the
nonbeliever
no
more...
no
less
than
it
does
the
believer,
and
to
the
extent--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--i
don't
think
that
those
holdings
depart
from
the
rule
of
law
ordained
by
the
founding
fathers.
in
other
words,
if
it
is
this
court's
mission
to
identify,
in
justice
brennan's
words,
the
line
between
the
permissible
and
the
impermissible,
and
to
discern
that
that
line
accords
with
history
and
faithfully
reflects
the
understanding
of
the
founding
fathers,
i
don't
think
you
can
depart
from
the
conclusion
that,
indeed,
the
establishment
clause
was
intended
to
protect
nonbelievers.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
don't
think
that
the--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--i
do
not
see
any
difference
with
respect
to
coercion.
i
don't
think
that
the
founding
fathers
would
have
any
more
countenanced
a
tax
to
support
all
ministers,
than
a
tax
just
to
support
christian
ministers.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
certainly
don't
quarrel
with
the
proposition
that
by
and
large
our
government
expression
of
religious
values
and
sentiments
has
been
nonsectarian.
it
has
been
nondenominational.
and
it
has
favored,
and
indeed
endorsed
religion.
but
i
believe
that
if
one
searches
the...
searches
the
record
of
the
development
of
the
establishment
clause
itself,
it's
very
difficult
to
say
that
the
founding
fathers,
that
the
framers
of
the
establishment
clause
meant
to,
ah,
permit
the
establishment
of
religion,
generally,
but
not
the
establishment
of
a
particular
religion.
and
so
i
think
that
the
analysis,
insofar
as
coercion
is
concerned,
is
the
same
whether
you're
talking
about
nonsectarian
speech
or
sectarian
speech,
except
to
the
extent,
again,
that
the
more
theologically
specific
it
is,
the
more
likely
it
is
to
be
coupled
with
elements
of
coercion.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
do
believe
that
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause
were,
ah,
were
framed
by
the
founding
fathers
to
accomplish
religious
freedom
generally,
both
to
prevent
the
government
from--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
do
believe
that
both
require
the
finding
of
some
coercive
pressure
on
the
individual--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--could
you,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
cannot
think
of
an
instance
where
that
might
not
be
the
case.
but
perhaps
you
have.
i
do
think
that,
however,
you
can
have
coercion
without
having
direct
coercion,
without
actually
mandating
attendance,
by
holding
out
substantial
inducements
to
attendance
that
would
amount
to
undue
influence.
i
believe
that
the
graduation
ceremony
context
may
well
be
such
an
instance.
so
in
that
regard,
if
this
case
were
coming
before
you
in
the
absence
of
the
stipulation
that
attendance
was
entirely
voluntary,
then
there
would
have
to
be
an
inquiry
into
whether
it
was
voluntary.
and
if
the
determination
was
that
it
was
not
voluntary,
that
attendance,
that
exposure
to
the
government's
speech,
was
not
purely
voluntary,
one
must
assess
the
nature
and
the
setting
of
that
speech
to
determine
if
it
is
coercive.
i
don't--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
an
accurate
statement.
and
certainly,
if
the
rule
that...
the
rule
of
law
that
you
are
suggesting
is
incorporated
in
the
establishment
clause,
then
this
invocation
in
this
benediction,
anyway,
before
you,
would
have
to
be
upheld,
because
it
was
clearly
nondenominational.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i...
i
believe
that
you're
right,
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
will
not
argue
with
that.
but
i
do
not
think
that
transformed
what
was
otherwise
a
very
nondenominational
invocation
into
something
that
was
sectarian.
but
even
if
it
did,
again,
i
would
want
to
reiterate,
that
would
not,
in
and
of
itself,
mean
that
the
religious
expression
was
coercive.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
it
might
well
qualify
as
sectarian.
in
other
words,
if...
to
use
a
prayer
that
is
associated
with
just
one
sect,
very
clearly
and
distinguishably
to
the
audience,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
maintain
that
that
was
not
sectarian.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
don't
see
how
anyone
could
compose
a
prayer
that
did
not
include
phrases
that
had
been
used
by
different
sects.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
one,
ah,
composed
a
prayer
using
phrases
from
a
number
of
different
sects,
they
would
have
the
very
definition
of
a
nonsectarian
prayer.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
thank
you.
