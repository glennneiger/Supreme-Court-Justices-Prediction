justice
byron
r.
white
well,
counsel,
don't
you
think
that...
you
ought
to
urge
the
court
not
to
depart
from
the
established
precedent
of
lemon?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
sound
like
you
really
don't
care
whether
we
depart
from
it
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
making
the
decision
turn
on
coercion
would
be,
in
effect,
overruling
the
line
of
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
that
this
is
a...
under
the
lemon
test,
this
case
turns
on
effects?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
below
turned
it
on
effects.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
below
turned
it
on
effects.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
tell
me
how
do
you
think
that
the
primary
effect
of
what
went
on
at
this
ceremony
is
to
advance
religion?
and
there
is
the
word
primary
in
the
lemon,
isn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
must
be...
there
might
be
an
effect
advancing
religion
that
isn't
a
primary
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
overtones
of
endorsement?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
the
endorsement
test
come
from?
it
isn't
part
of
lemon,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
or
not?
