mr.
cooper,
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
you
say
it
was
nondenominational.
i
read
from
the
benediction:
"we
must
each
strive
to
fulfill
what
you
require
of
us
all,
to
do
justly,
to
love
mercy,
to
walk
humbly.
"
that's
lifted
almost
verbatim
from
the
sixth
verse
of
the
eighth
chapter
of
the
prophet
micah,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
believe
so?
