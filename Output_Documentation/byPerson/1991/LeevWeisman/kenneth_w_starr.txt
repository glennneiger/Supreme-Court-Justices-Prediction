mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
frequently
looked
to
history
and
tradition
in
its
interpretation
of
the
establishment
clause.
indeed,
it
was
justice
brennan
who
said
that
our
interpretation
in
this
area
must
be
guided
by
history,
and
by
the
understanding
of
the
founding
fathers.
rabbi
gutterman's
invocation
and
benediction
are
a
far
cry
from
practices
that
the
founding
fathers
meant
to
stop
by
means
of
the
establishment
clause.
to
the
contrary,
the
acknowledgement
of
god,
the
invocation
of
god's
blessing,
the
expression
of
thanks
of
the
nation
to
god,
are
practices
that
are
as
old
and
enduring
as
the
republic
itself.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
of
course
not.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
absolutely
not,
not
in
our
traditions.
it
could
be,
at
one
level,
a
generality
yes,
of
course.
because
you
are
asserting
a
theological
belief
that
stands
squarely
in
the
judeo-christian
tradition,
yes.
but
not
sectarian
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
been
concerned
about
it.
the
concern
has
been
manifested
in
two
ways.
do
the
particular
practices
accord,
and
are
they
tied
to
the
traditions
and
the
history
of
the
nation?
and
from
the
earliest
days
of
this
nation,
beginning
with
washington's
own
invocation,
his
own
urging
of
the
nation
to
set
aside
time
for
prayer,
a
practice
that
continues
to
this
day.
the
point
has
been
that
we
believe
ourselves,
as
a
people,
to
be
one
nation
under
god.
but
we
nonetheless,
while
acknowledging
that,
in
innumerable
ways
in
our
public
life,
respect
freedom
of
conscience.
that
was
the
point
in
wallace
against
jaffree.
it
was
that
unifying--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--we
are
not,
because
of
concerns
about
coercion
that
are,
in
fact,
at
the
heart
of
religious
liberty.
it
is
a
violation,
a
denial
of
religious
liberty
to
coerce
an
individual
with
respect
to
an
act
of
conscience.
that
was--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--they
do,
indeed.
with
respect
to
the
classroom,
we
believe
that
even
though
the
child
is
told,
you
do
not
have
to
participate
in
this,
there
is,
nonetheless,
a
powerful
subtle
indirect
coercive
pressure
on
the
child
in
the
classroom...
with
all
that
that
means...
compulsory
attendance
laws,
the
school
with
its
officials,
its
authority
figures
and
the
like.
in
our
judgment,
a
commencement
exercise,
even
on
the
school
property
is
much
more
in
the
nature
of
a
celebration.
it
is
a
ceremony.
it
is
not
part
of
the
educational
or
instructional...
i'm
sorry--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--if
it
is
being
given,
justice
stevens--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--if
it's
compelled
by...
oh,
i
think
that's
unconstitutional.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
because
i
believe
coercion
is
very
much
at
work
in
the
classroom
setting.
that
is
why,
even
though
the
court
has
been
debating
now
for
many
years
the
extent
to
which
coercion
is
the
sine
qua
non
of
the
establishment
clause--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
justice
stevens.
i
tried
to
be
clear
in
saying
that
i
believe
the
graduation
ceremony
is
a
ceremonial
event.
it's
not
part
of
an
instructional
program
in
the
schools.
it
is
more
like
attending
the
inauguration
of
the
president,
or
the
mayor--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
the
case
becomes
more
difficult.
but
i
would
still
say,
that
as
this
court's
cases
have
said,
that
acknowledgments
of
god
and
the
role
of
god
in
our
life
as
a
nation
is
in
fact
a
part
of
accommodation.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
correct
answer
is
to
say,
yes,
you
must
be
there.
you
cannot
be
required
to
participate
in
the
prayer
such
as
you
must
rise,
and
the
like.
but
you
can,
in
fact,
exercise
your
freedom
of
conscience
the
way
we
do
when
we're
asked
to
pledge
allegiance...
allegiance
to
the
flag
of
the
united
states.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
looked--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
they
may
choose
to
stand.
but--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
point
is,
we
listened...
justice
kennedy,
we
hear
a
lot
of
things
in
a
free
society,
with
robust
and
uninhibited
debate,
with
which
we
fervently
disagree.
and
a
prayer
may
be
among
them.
and
the
point
is,
are
we
seeking
to
accommodate
the
traditions
of
the
nation,
or
are
we
trying
to
engage
in
what
this
court
has
warned
about
time
and
again...
proselytizing.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
the
point
is
that
the
act
itself
is
an
act
of
acknowledgement
of
our
traditions
as
a
people.
when
we
look
to
history,
when
we
heard
what
happened
in
this
courtroom
this
morning,
god's
name
was
invoked
in
two
instances.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
felt
it
necessary
to
stand
up.
but
the
point
is
that
we
do,
justice
souter,
have
to
listen
to
things.
we
don't
have
to...
and
this
is
the
distinction,
and
i
hope
i'm
being
clear...
and
that
is,
in
barnett,
you
shouldn't
have
to
participate
in
the
sense
of
giving
assent.
you
may
have
to
be
present
to
hear
things
that
you
disagree
with.
but
does
that
violate
freedom
of
conscience?
i
don't
think
so,
unless
the
government
is
seeking
to
coerce
the
individual
through
proselytizing.
the
point
on
the
sectarian
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
our
traditions...
and
the
law
of
this
court
is
quite
clear...
that
the
more
sectarian...
that
sectarianism
is,
in
fact,
an
inherently
divisive
force,
and
that
is
something
that
the
establishment
clause
has
long
looked
to
guard
against.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
discrimination--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
was
just
going
to
say
discrimination
among
sects...
are
saying
we
favor
this
particular
sect.
here
in
pawtucket
we
favor
judaism,
or
we
favor
the
roman
catholic
church,
would
be
wrong.
that
is
an
establishment
clause
danger
that
madison
warned
about.
that's
sectarianism.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
that
the
engel
tradition
is
implicated
outside
the
classroom.
i
urge
the
court
to
think
long
and
hard
before
it
determines
that
a
graduation
prayer
is
more
in
the
nature
of
a
classroom
event
with
the
teacher
in
control
of
the
classroom,
and
with
a
child
in
that
setting
having
to
get
up
and
vote
with
her
feet.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is
certainly
closer.
but
the
point...
may
i,
mr.
chief
justice,
respond...
the
points
i
would
make
very
briefly
are
these.
there
are
parents
and
loved
ones
present.
this
is,
after
all,
as
a
legal
matter...
and
i
think
the
legal
aspect
of
this
should
not
be
overlooked--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
the
presence
of
the
parents
is
not
a
talisman.
it's
the
point
that
this
is
a
ceremony,
so
the
child
knows
that
what
the
child
is
plugging
into
is
a
tradition
of
ceremonial
celebrations.
you
are
plugging
into
society
by
virtue
of
your
being
elevated
from
one
passageway
to
another.
you're
not
in
a
classroom
setting.
that
is
a
clear
distinction.
the
fact
that
the
parents
are
present
there,
and
who
have
been
able
to
advise
the
child
beforehand...
you
may
hear
things
that
you
don't
like
and
you
don't
agree
with.
you
may
hear
a
graduation
speaker
with
whom
you
fervently
disagree.
but
that's
the
nature
of
this
society.
that's
part
of
a
free
society.
i
think
that--
