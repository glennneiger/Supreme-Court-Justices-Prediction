but
simply
making
the
prayer
sectarian--
why
would
a
sectarian
prayer
be
any
more
coercive
than
this
prayer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
imposition
would
require
the
same
result
if
they,
say
they
had
mass,
if
they
prayed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
say
our
father
13
times.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
one
be
any
more
coercive
than
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
one
be
any
more
coercive
than
the
other,
under
your
view
of
what
coercion
means?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
could
you
coerce
the
audience?
they
don't
have
to
listen.
i
don't
understand
how
a
statement
from
the
podium
could
be
coercive
under
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nothing
more
than
please
stand,
nothing
more
than
please
stand...
which
i
assume
happens
in
all
graduations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then...
but
then
a
very
sectarian
series
of
prayers,
if
the
student
need
not
listen
to
them?
why
is
that
any
more
coercive
than
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
government--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
endorsing
a
particular
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
simply
don't
follow
you,
why
one
is
more
coercive
than
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
this
particular
prayer,
if
given
at
the
opening
of
a
classroom
in
school,
in
your
judgment
be
constitutional
or
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
classroom
and
compelled
by...
by
the
teacher
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
would
definitely
not
pass
your
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
distinction
between
this
case
and
that
case
is
simply
that
the
attendance
at
the
graduation
is
voluntary,
whereas
attendance
at
class
is
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
ever
been
to
a
graduation
where
the
parents
sit
with
the
children?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
ever
been
to
a
graduation
where
the
parents
sit
with
the
children?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
how
often
prayers
such
as
this
have
been
said
in
graduation
ceremonies
during
the
history
of
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
tells
us
about
this
particular
graduation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
does
it
tell
us
anything
about
the
extent
to
which
this
practice
has
been
followed
in
any
other
school
in
the
united
states--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
any
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
don't
really
know
if
there
have
ever
been
such
things
before,
do
we?
