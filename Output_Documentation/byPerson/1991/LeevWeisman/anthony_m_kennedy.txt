has
there
been
a
stipulation
that
there's
no
stigma
to
the
student
who
absents
him
or
herself
from
the
graduation
during
the
prayer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
accept
the
proposition
that
it
is
not
a
substantial
imposition
on
a
young
graduate
to
say
you
have
your
choice
of...
i
want
to
characterize
it
in
a
neutral
way...
hearing
this
prayer,
or
absenting
yourself
from
the
graduation.
in
our
culture,
a
graduation
is
a
key
event
in
the
young
person's
life.
the
family
comes,
aunts,
uncles,
brothers,
sisters.
and
i
think
it's
a
very,
very
substantial
burden
on
the
person
to
say
that
he
or
she
cannot...
can
elect
not
to
go.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could
you
have
coercion
from
an
establishment
standpoint
but
not
a
free
exercise
standpoint?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
in
other
words,
if
you
find
coercion
in
one,
do
you
necessarily
find
coercion
in
the
other?
do
you
have
to
have
the
same
level
of
coercion
to
satisfy
an
equal
protection...
or
an
establishment
challenge,
as
you
do
a
free
exercise
challenge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
not
urging
that
we
reexamine
engel
v.
vitale,
are
you,
the
supreme
court
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
attendance
were
required
at
the
graduation
ceremony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
whole
class
was
asked
to
rise.
suppose
that
they
walked
down
as
a
class
together
to
the
strains
of
elgar,
and
they
sit
as
a
class,
and
they're
all
asked
to
rise.
and
i
take
it
the
option
you're
suggesting--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
this
is
a
mandatory
attendance.
i
take
it
the
option
you're
suggesting
is
that
the
students
who
object
can
remain
seated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
cross
their
fingers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
at
this
graduation
the
rabbi
was
present
and
he
stood
up
before
the
main
commencement
speaker
and
said,
i've
been
asked
by
the
principal,
on
behalf
of
all
the
clergy
here
in...
in
providence
to
congratulate
you
and
to
welcome
you.
we've
been
praying
for
you,
and
we
want
you
to
know
that
all
of
our
churches
are
open
to
you,
and
we
hope
that
you
take
advantage
of
the
rich
resources
that
the
religious
community
has
here
in
providence.
a
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they're
not
asked
to
stand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
your
answers
to
these
questions
that
justice
o'connor
and
i
are
asking
be
the
same
if
this
court
or
any
of
its
justices
were
to
use
the
dissent
in
allegheny
as
the
analytical
framework--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i.e.,
are
you
answering
based
on
the
lemon
test
or
an...
or
an
endorsement
sort
of
a
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
under
the
coercion
test
of
the
allegheny
dissent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
the
coercion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there,
then,
a
free
exercise
violation,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
argue
that
there
was
a
free
exercise
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
you
argued
in
your
briefs
that
there's
a
free
exercise
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
of
course,
on
that
line
of
reasoning,
i
assume
that
the
inaugural
prayer
and
the
prayer
in
marsh
v.
alabama
are
also
inappropriate.
and
you're
just
asking
us
to
reconsider
those
decisions
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
logic
of
your
argument
applies
equally
to
those.
and
it
seems
if
those
are
on
the
books,
that
you
should
be
required
to
notice,
and
to
make
a
distinction
between
a
catholic
mass
and
a
sectarian
prayer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
he
coercion
test...
what
about
the
coercion
test?
you
said
endorsement.
i
assume
that
you
meant
endorsement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
your
answer
the
same
with
reference
to
coercion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
what
a
controlled
classroom
environment
has
to
do
with
endorsement.
i
can
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
coercion,
not
with
endorsement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
summary
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
as
follows:
school
principals
in
the
public
school
system
of
city
of
providence,
rhode
island
are
permitted
to
invite
members
of
the
clergy
to
offer
invocation
and
benediction
prayers
as
part
of
formal
graduation
ceremonies
for
middle
schools
and
for
high
schools.
we
granted
certiorari
when
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
held
that
this
practice
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
in
june
of
1989,
deborah
weisman
graduated
in
a
formal
ceremony
from
the
nathan
bishop
middle
school
in
providence,
and
she
was
about
14
at
the
time.
the
principal
of
deborah's
middle
school
invited
rabbi
leslie
gutterman
to
deliver
two
prayers
at
the
graduation,
an
invocation
and
a
benediction.
the
principal
provided
the
rabbi
with
a
pamphlet
to
guide
him
in
the
composition
of
the
prayers
and
instructed
him
that
the
prayers
should
be
non-sectarian.
deborah's
father,
daniel
weisman,
objected
to
the
prayers
but
to
no
avail.
the
weismans
attended
the
ceremony
and
the
rabbi
delivered
the
prayers.
both
prayers
made
specific
reference
to
god
but
did
not
make
explicit
reference
to
the
tenants
of
any
particular
religious
sect.
during
the
prayers,
the
students
stood
and
as
in
most
graduation
ceremonies,
the
students
were
sitting
together
as
a
group
under
the
supervision
of
teachers
and
school
officials.
deborah
is
now
enrolled
in
a
providence
public
high
school,
and
her
father
seeks
an
injunction
forbidding
school
officials
from
including
prayers
like
the
rabbi's
in
future
graduation
ceremonies.
these
dominant
facts
mark
and
control
the
confines
of
our
decision.
state
officials
direct
the
performance
of
a
formal
religious
exercise
at
promotional
and
graduation
ceremonies
for
secondary
schools.
even
for
those
students
who
object
the
religious
exercise,
their
attendance
and
participation
in
the
state-sponsored
religious
activity
are
in
a
fair
and
real
sense
obligatory
though
the
school
district
does
not
require
attendance
as
a
condition
for
receipt
of
the
diploma.
the
government
involvement
with
the
religious
activity
in
this
case
is
pervasive
to
the
point
of
creating
a
state-sponsored
and
state-directed
religious
exercise
in
a
public
school.
conducting
this
form
of
religious
observance
conflicts
with
set
of
rules
which
pertaining
to
prayer
exercises
for
students.
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
at
a
minimum
constitution
guarantees
the
government
may
not
coerce
anyone
to
support
a
participating
religion
or
its
exercise
or
otherwise
act
in
a
way
which
establishes
a
state
religion
or
religious
faith
or
tends
to
do
so.
the
state's
involvement
in
the
school
prayers
challenged
today
is
contrary
to
these
central
principles
and
therefore,
violates
the
establishment
clause.
that
involvement
is
as
troubling
as
it
is
undenied.
school
officials
decided
that
an
invocation
and
benediction
should
be
given
chose
the
religious
participant
here
rabbi,
and
directed
in
control
the
content
of
the
prayers
30
years
ago.
we
recognize
that
it
is
no
part
of
the
business
of
government
to
compose
official
prayers
for
any
group
of
the
american
people
to
recite
as
part
of
a
religious
program
carried
on
by
the
government,
and
that
is
what
school
officials
attempted
to
do.
petitioners
argue,
and
we
find
nothing
in
the
case
to
refute
it,
that
the
directions
for
the
content
of
the
prayers
were
a
good
faith
attempt
by
the
school
to
avoid
divisive
sectarianism.
now,
we
are
asked
to
recognize
the
existence
of
a
practice
of
non-sectarian
prayer,
a
prayer
within
the
embrace
of
what
is
known
as
the
judeo-christian
tradition,
a
prayer
which
is
more
acceptable
than
the
one
which,
for
example,
makes
explicit
references
to
the
god
of
israel
or
to
jesus
christ
or
to
a
patron
saint,
but
we
could
not
do
so.
the
first
amendment's
religion
clauses
mean
that
religious
beliefs
and
religious
expression
are
too
precious
to
be
either
proscribed
or
prescribed
by
the
state.
the
design
of
the
constitution
is
that
preservation
and
transmission
of
religious
beliefs
and
worship
is
a
responsibility
and
a
choice
committed
to
the
private
sphere
which
itself
has
promised
freedom
to
pursue
that
mission.
suggestion
that
government
may
establish
an
official
more
civic
religion
as
a
means
of
avoiding
the
establishment
of
a
religion
with
more
specific
creeds
strikes
us
a
contradiction
that
cannot
be
accepted.
the
degree
of
school
involvement
here
made
it
clear
that
the
graduation
prayers
for
the
imprint
of
the
state
and
thus,
puts
school-aged
children
to
object
it
in
an
untenable
position.
to
endure
the
speech
of
false
ideas
or
offensive
content
and
then
to
counter
it
is
part
of
learning
how
to
live
in
a
pluralistic
society,
a
society
which
insists
upon
open
discourse
towards
the
end
of
a
tolerant
citizenry.
intolerance
does
presuppose
some
mutuality
of
obligation.
by
the
time
they
are
seniors,
high
school
students
no
doubt
had
been
required
to
attend
classes
and
assemblies
and
to
complete
assignments
exposing
them
to
ideas
they
find
distasteful
or
immoral
or
absurd
or
all
of
these.
against
this
background,
students
may
consider
it
an
odd
measure
of
justice
to
be
subjected
during
the
course
of
their
education
to
ideas
deemed
offensive
and
irreligious
but
to
be
denied
a
brief
formal
prayer
ceremony
that
the
school
offers
in
return.
this
argument
cannot
prevail,
however
it
overlooks
a
fundamental
dynamic
of
the
constitution.
in
religious
debate
or
expression,
the
government
is
not
a
prime
participant.
framers
deemed
religious
establishment
antithetical
to
their
freedom
of
ore.
the
free
exercise
clause
embraces
the
freedom
of
conscious
and
worship
that
does
have
close
parallels
in
the
speech
provisions
of
the
first
amendment,
but
the
establishment
clause
is
a
specific
provision
on
forms
of
state
intervention
in
religious
affairs
with
no
precise
counterpart
in
the
speech
provisions.
a
lesson
of
history
that
was
and
is
the
inspiration
for
the
establishment
clause
is
that
in
the
hands
of
government,
what
might
begin
as
tolerant
expression
of
religious
views
may
end
in
a
policy
to
indoctrinate
in
coerce.
the
government
argues
that
the
option
of
not
attending
the
graduation
excuses
any
inducement
of
coercion
in
the
ceremony
itself.
we
think
that
argument
lacks
all
persuasion,
everyone
knows
that
in
our
society
and
in
our
culture,
high
school
graduation
is
one
of
life's
most
significant
occasions.
attendance
may
not
be
required
by
official
decree.
it
is
apparent
that
the
student
is
not
free
to
absent
herself
from
the
graduation
exercises
in
any
real
sense
of
the
term
voluntary.
the
constitution
forbids
the
state
to
exact
religious
conformity
from
a
student
as
the
price
of
attending
her
own
high
school
graduation.
the
sole
question
presented
is
whether
a
religious
exercise
may
be
conducted
at
a
graduation
ceremony
in
circumstances
where,
as
we
have
found,
young
graduates
who
object
are
induced
to
conform.
no
holding
by
this
court
suggest
that
a
school
can
persuade
or
compel
a
student
to
participate
in
a
religious
exercise.
that
is
being
done
here
and
it
is
forbidden
by
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
