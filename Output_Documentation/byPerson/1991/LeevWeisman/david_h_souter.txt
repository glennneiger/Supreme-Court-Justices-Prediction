justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
people
who
are
listening
to
the
prayer
are
capable
of
exercising
different
degrees
of
judgment,
and
hence
different
degrees
of
assent
or
nonassent
by
their
being
there.
isn't
that
another
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
counsel,
if
the
point
is
that
they
don't
have
to
listen
or
don't
have
to
participate,
why
can't
you
use
a
sectarian
prayer?
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
say
sectarian,
you
mean
that
the
entire
prayer
has
got
to
be
lifted
or
taken
verbatim
from
some
traditional,
sectarian
liturgy
or
traditional
expression
of
prayer?
or
would
it...
would
it
be...
let
me
give
you
the
alternative...
would
it
be
sectarian
if
selected
phrases
had
been
taken,
not
only
from
the
bible,
as
justice
blackmun
suggested,
but
from
recognized,
written
prayers
of
a
given
religion,
and
had
just
been
en-sprinkled
into
this,
and
incorporated
into
this,
but
not...
not
verbatim?
would
that
qualify
as
sectarian?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
how
about
using
half
a
prayer
or
a
third
of
a
prayer?
i
mean
would...
is
your
using
the
word
sectarian
to
draw
this
distinction,
would
it
be
sectarian
if
simply
selected
phrases
had
been
taken
out
of
a
traditional
liturgy
and
rearranged
and
otherwise
incorporated
into
fresh
material?
justice
david
h.
souter
except
the
prayer
is
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--general,
a
prayer
is
not
one
element
in
a
dialogue
between
people.
it's
an
element
conceivably
in
a
dialogue
between
the
people
and
god.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
analogize
that
to
free
debate.
justice
david
h.
souter
general,
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
accept
the
kind
of
the
concept
of
tradition
as
a
source
of
a
criterion,
don't
we
really
have
not
an
easy
answer
here,
as
i
think
you're
suggesting,
but
a
difficult
one?
because
we've
got...
we've
really
got
two
traditions
that
we're
going
to
have
to
reconcile.
one
is
a
tradition
of
some
religious
expression
on
public
occasions,
and
the
other
is
a
tradition
which,
i
guess,
is
the
school
tradition,
which
does
not
have
such
a
history,
and
which...
at
least
so
far
as
your
brother
is
concerned...
should
be
treated
on
the
assumption
that
engel
is
good
law.
so
if
engel
is
going
to
be
good
law,
then
when
you
get
to
the
point
of
tradition,
we've
got
to
choose
which
tradition
it's
going
to
be.
is
it
going
to
be
the
tradition
of
engel,
or
is
it
going
to
be
the
tradition
of
noneducational
public
gatherings
at
which
the
deity
is
mentioned?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
analogy
a
lot
closer
there
than
it
is
to
a
presidential
inauguration?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that
a
product
of
the
manner
in
which
the
graduation
is
held,
and
the
freedom
to
come
and
go...
or
lack
of
freedom
to
come
and
go...
or
is
it
because
of
the
sophistication
of
the
children
or
the
adolescents,
so
that
the
effect
of
them
is
going
to
be
different
from
the
effect
on
legislators
who
may
be
standing
here,
or
anyone
in
this
courtroom
who
may
be
standing
here
and
hearing
god
save
the
united
states?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
graduation
from
state
universities,
under
your
analysis.
if
we
have
prayer
of
this
sort,
is
the
result
going
to
be
different,
under
your
view?
i
mean,
graduating
seniors
today
engage
in
demonstrations;
they
certainly
have
not
indicated
undue
enthusiasm
for
authority
figures
in
the
last
few
decades.
[laughter]
are
you
going
to
say
there
isn't
as
much
danger,
and
hence
you're
not
going
to
come
up
with
an
establishment
conclusion?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
it
is
an
endorsement
test,
not
a-coercion
test
that
you're
resting
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
also
a
substantial
part
of
the
answer
to
the...
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
thanksgiving
proclamation?
effect
depends
on--
justice
david
h.
souter
--who's
receiving
it,
and
the
audience
is
different.
don't
you
rely,
at
least
in
part,
on
that?
