justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cooper,
the
injunction
sought
here...
this
plaintiff
is
now
out
of
the
middle
school
and
in
high
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
sought
to
be
enjoined
is
the
invocation
in
high
school,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
public
schools
in
general.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
high
school
students,
how
old
are
they?
they're
about
18,
i
would
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
that
line
doesn't
work,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
that
line
doesn't
work,
that
it's
only
okay
if
you
don't
have
to
listen
to
it.
i
mean
certainly
counsel
here,
who
listened
to,
you
know,
god
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court
have
to
be
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
we
let
them
walk
in
after
that
is
said
in
the
court.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well
counsel
have
to
be
here,
but
they
don't
have
to
agree
to
it,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
either,
mr.
cooper.
and
you're
trying
to
say
the
only
test
is
coercion.
i
don't...
i
just
don't
think
that
comports
with
our
tradition.
you
cite
thanksgiving
proclamations,
you
cite
the
god
save
the
united
states.
i
mean
we
don't
say
jesus
christ
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court.
and
i
don't
think
that
would
be
in
accord
with
our
religious
freedom
tradition...
or,
in
jesus
christ
we
trust
on
the
coins.
we
wouldn't
put
that
in
there,
would
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
no
more
coercive
than
saying
god.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
the
only...
but
if
we
could
get
the
votes
for
it,
we
could
do
it
under
the
constitution?
is
that
what
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
one
can
abandon
lemon
without
going
as
far
as
you're
asserting,
mr.
cooper.
why
not
noncoercion
plus
nonsectarian?
don't
you
really
think
that
accords
a
lot
more
with
all
of
the
exam...
the
historical
examples
that
you
give,
with
perhaps
the
exception
of
the
year
of
the
bible,
which
doesn't
go
back
to
thomas
jefferson.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
yes--
--those
have
been
upheld
by
this
court.
--but
we
haven't
confronted
the
case
where
the
creche
is
allowed
to
be
put
there
but
the
menorah
not,
where
we
say
we're
only
going
to
allow
the
creche
to
be
put
there,
and
the
state
will
not
allow
other
religious
symbols
during
other
religious
holidays
to
be
put
there.
that's
a
quite
different
issue.
you
think
that...
do
you
think
you
give
a
tax
exemption
only
to
christian
churches,
not
to
other
churches,
or
only
to
presbyterian
churches?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
and
you
want
to
stick
to
those
holdings,
but
not...
but
not
to...
ah,
ah...
the
three-part
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
our
historical
tradition
establishes
just
as
clearly
that
the
state
cannot
favor
religion
over
irreligion,
as
it
establishes
that
the
state
cannot
favor
one
religious
sect
over
another
religious
sect?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
see
any
difference
between
them...
in
our
constitutional
tradition?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
apart
from
the
coercion
context.
i'm
talking
about
thanksgiving
proclamations,
i'm
talking
about
in
god
we
trust.
you
do
not
see
anything
in
our
constitutional
additions
that
says
you
cannot
be
sectarian?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
if
you
said
that
the
establishment
clause
requires
both
noncoercion
and
nonsectarianism,
then
it
wouldn't
have
a
content
different
from
the
free
exercise
clause,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
sectarian--
justice
antonin
scalia
--general
starr,
to
use
the
word
god
instead
of
allah?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
had
to
be
here
and
you
had
to
stand
up,
didn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
invocations
at
graduations
are
a
rote
sort
of
thing?
[laughter]
does
this
mean
that
a
public
school
cannot
bring
students
in
to
a...
to
a
session
of
this
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can
or
they
can't?
they
can?
is
that
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
required
class,
i
mean
you
have
to
come
to
class
and
we're
going
to
put
you
on
a
bus
and
you
come
to
hear
the
court
session,
or
you
come
to
watch
a
presidential
inauguration.
can
the
public
school
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
even
though
the
word
god
would
be
invoked?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
not
be
the
history
for
the
past
few
decades,
but
i'll
bet
there
was
before...
before
there
came
to
be
any
doubt
about
whether
such
invocations
could
be
given
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
blanding,
suppose
in
addition
to
drawing
the
line
between
coercion
and
noncoercion,
we
drew
a
line
between
instruction
and
noninstruction?
don't
you
see
a
difference
between
a
prayer
at
the
opening
of
a
class
in
a
context
where
students
are
there
to
learn,
to
be
instructed...
doesn't
that
have
a
different
impact
than
a
prayer
at
a
ceremony
like
a
graduation,
which
is
not
an
educational
program,
it's
not
an
instructional
exercise.
isn't
there
a
difference
between
people
voluntarily
wishing
to
invoke
the
blessing
of
god,
and
people
trying
to
instruct
people
about
god?
isn't
that
a
difference
that
makes
some
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
we
have
invocations
like
that
at
all
sorts
of
events,
not
just
high
school
graduations.
i
mean,
we
do
it
at
the
opening
of
court,
we
do
it
at
the
opening
of
congress.
it's
people
in
a
country
which
overwhelmingly
believes
in
god
wanting
to
invoke
god's
blessing,
without
trying
to
instruct
others
about
that.
why
is
it
suddenly
different
when
it
happens
at
a
high
school
graduation
or
a
middle
school
graduation?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's
less
coercion.
i
mean,
all
of
these
differences
you're
pointing
out
go
precisely
to
the
coercion
point,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
that's
the...
i
don't
understand
your
basis
for
saying
schools
are
an
entirely
different
area,
unless
somehow
it's
a
coercion
basis,
or
an
instruction
basis,
is
it?
because
otherwise,
marsh
and
the
invocation
at
the
beginning
of
court,
and
in
congress...
you're
talking
a
few
decades
of
cases,
as
you
mention.
we're
talking
a
few
hundred
years
of
traditional
practices
in
this
country,
which
you
somehow
have
to
reconcile
with
the
notion
that
you
can't
have
an
invocation
at
a
high
school
graduation.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
college
seniors...
i
mean,
that
was
the
last
hypothetical.
on
college
seniors,
do
you
think
they
are
being
coerced,
more
than
the
people
in
this
courtroom
when
there
is
an
apparent
endorsement
of
religion?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
is,
if
you
don't
use
a
coercion
test,
if
you
use
an
endorsement
test,
which
you
seem
to
be
falling
back
on
when
you're
presented
with
the
college
example,
then
there's
no
basis
for
distinguishing
schools
from
courtrooms,
from...
from
halls
of
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
college,
colleges,
we're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
have
to
say
that
that's
good,
unless
you're
using
a
coercion
test
rather
than
an
endorsement
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
blanding,
do
you
subscribe
to
that
version
of
the
lemon
test
which
says
that
the
primary
purpose
and
effect
must
not
be
to
advance
religion,
or
to
the
other
version
that
says
that
a
primary
purpose
or
effect
must
not
be
to
advance...
because
we've
used
both,
depending
on
whether
we
want
to
uphold
or
not
to
uphold.
[laughter]
which
one
of
the
two
do
you
like?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
a
thanksgiving
proclamation
do
that?
and
why
is
that
any
worse?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you're
talking
about
making
people...
you
know,
if
that's
the
test,
whether
people
are
made
to
feel
like
outsiders,
if
you're
going
to
use
an
endorsement
test,
is
there
anything
that's
more
of
an
endorsement
than
a
thanksgiving
proclamation...
which
virtually
every
president
has
issued?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case
with
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
white,
and
justice
thomas
have
joined,
i
will
not
describe
it
at
lengths
except
to
say
that
we
disagree
with
some
of
the
principle
premisses
of
the
court.
the
premise,
for
example,
that
the
prayer
was
directed
by
the
principals
of
the
schools
here.
in
fact,
it
was
written
by
rabbi
gutterman
himself.
the
only
direction
was
the
provision
of
a
two-page
flyer
from
the
national
conference
of
christians
and
jews
which
described
how
to
go
about
drawing
up
a
non-sectarian
prayer.
we
disagree
with
the
assertions
of
coercion
that
the
majority
opinion
makes.
not
only
was
not
attendance
mandatory
but
standing
up
was
not
mandatory,
much
less
participating
in
the
prayer.
the
only
coercion
involved
here
is
the
psychological
coercion
that
is
asserted
to
come
from
being
present
where
others
are
praying,
this
at
a
high
school
graduation
involving
young
men
and
women,
most
of
whom
are
old
enough
to
drive
and
many
of
whom
are
old
enough
to
vote.
at
the
beginning
of
our
republic,
george
washington
began
his
inarguable
address
with
a
statement
that
it
would
be
peculiarly
improper.
to
admit
in
this
first
official
act
my
fervent
supplications
to
that
almighty
being
who
rules
over
the
universe
who
presides
in
the
councils
of
nations
and
whose
providential
aids
can
supply
every
human
defect,
that
his
benediction
may
consecrate
to
the
liberties
and
happiness
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
a
government
instituted
by
themselves
for
these
essential
purposes.
rabbi
gutterman's
prayer
was
not
much
different
from
that.
it
went,
god
of
the
free,
hope
of
the
brave
for
the
legacy
of
america
where
diversity
is
celebrated
and
the
rights
of
minorities
are
protected,
we
thank
you.
may
these
young
men
and
women
grow
up
to
enrich
it.
for
the
liberty
of
america,
we
thank
you.
may
these
new
graduates
grow
up
to
guard
it.
for
the
political
process
of
america
in
which
all
its
citizens
may
participate
for
its
court
system
where
all
may
seek
justice,
we
thank
you.
may
those
we
honor
this
morning
always
turn
to
it
in
trust.
for
the
destiny
of
america,
we
thank
you.
may
the
graduates
of
nation
bishop
middle
school
so
live
that
they
might
help
to
share
it.
the
reasons,
i
think
it
is
sad
that
a
prayer
of
this
sort
is
sought
to
be
abolished
from
our
graduation
ceremony
i
describe
in
the
conclusion
of
the
dissent
which
i
will
read,
the
founders
of
our
republic
knew
the
fearsome
potential
of
sectarian
religious
belief
to
generate
civil
dissension
and
civil
strife,
and
they
also
knew
that
nothing,
absolutely
nothing,
is
so
inclined
to
foster
among
religious
believers
of
various
faiths
a
toleration,
know
and
affection
for
one
another,
and
voluntary
joining
in
prayer
together
to
the
god
whom
they
all
worship
and
seek.
needless
to
say,
no
one
should
be
compelled
to
do
that,
but
it
is
a
shame
to
deprive
our
public
culture
of
the
opportunity
and
in
deed
the
encouragement
for
people
to
do
it
voluntarily.
the
baptist
or
catholic
who
heard
and
joined
in
the
simple
and
inspiring
prayer
of
rabbi
gutterman
on
this
official
and
patriotic
occasion
was
inoculated
from
religious
bigotry
and
prejudice
in
a
manner
that
can
never
be
replicated.
to
deprive
our
society
of
that
important
unifying
mechanism
in
order
to
spear
the
nonbeliever,
what
seem
to
me,
the
minimal
inconvenience
of
standing
or
even
siting
in
respectful
non-participation
is
as
senseless
in
policy
at
it
is
unsupported
in
law.
for
those
reasons,
i
dissent.
