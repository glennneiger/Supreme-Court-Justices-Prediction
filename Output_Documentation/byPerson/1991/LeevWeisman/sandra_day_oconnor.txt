if
the
same
prayer
were
offered
at
the
opening
and
closing
of
classes
in
the
public
schools,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
not?
under
your
test
it
wouldn't
be
coercive.
they
wouldn't
have
to
participate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
the
very
same
prayer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
is
it
voluntary
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
children
are
perfectly
free
to
attend
their
commencement
or
not.
is
that
the
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
take
that
line,
i
just
don't
see
how
you
can
draw
the
distinction,
then,
about
the
same
prayer
given
in
the
classroom.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
have
to
listen,
right?
i
mean
that
would
be
your
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were...
were
the
children
at
this
commencement
exercise
all
seated
together?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
know.
we
don't
know.
and
you
don't
know
if
they
were
all
asked
to
stand
and
bow
their
heads?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it
do
so
if
a
state
legislature
were
to
adopt
a
particular
religion
as
the
state
religion,
just
like
they
might
pass
a
resolution
saying
the
bolo
tie
is
the
state
necktie?
[laughter]
we'll
pass
the
resolution
that
whatever
that
particular
church
is,
is
the
state
church...
although
it's
not
coercive.
we're
not
going
to
enforce
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
coercive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
in
your
view,
that
would
be
perfectly
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
certainly
hasn't
been
our
case
holdings
over
a
substantial
period
of
time.
you
would
ask
us
to
overturn
a
line
of
this
court's
precedents
to
reach
your
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cooper,
it
sounds
very
much--
--of
course
it's
not--
--as
though
your
test
would
make
the
test
under
the
establishment
clause
more
or
less
the
test
used
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
making
the
establishment
clause
pretty
much
a
redundancy,
wouldn't
you
say?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
the
test
the
same
under
either
clause
for
a
particular
challenge?
you
think
it's
essentially
the
same
inquiry.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how...
how
is
it...
how
does
the
analysis
fit
in
the
situation
where
the
child
is
excused
from
participating
in
the
classroom
prayer?
how
would
your
test
meet
that,
and
how
is
that
different
from
the
graduation
or
commencement
exercise,
which
all
the
children,
obviously,
want
to
attend
as
part
of
their
school
experience?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
the
courtroom
prayer
that
we've
heard
argued
and
referred
to
this
morning...
ah,
if
you
want
to
call
it
a
prayer...
at
least
the
opening
of
court,
in
which
the
reference
is
made
to
the
deity,
and
where
people
are
expected
to
be
here
and
to
stand
up
and
listen
to
it.
now,
how
do
you
distinguish
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
does
that
mean
that
the
school
can't
invite
a
commencement
speaker
like
martin
luther
king,
who
might
make
all
kinds
of
references
to
the
religious
experience
and
the
need
to
rely
upon
god's
help
in
creating
a
just
society?
now,
is
the
school
forbidden
from
doing
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
knowingly
invite
someone
to
be
the
commencement
speaker,
knowing
that
it's
very
likely
that
the
person
invited
will
speak
in
that
fashion.
