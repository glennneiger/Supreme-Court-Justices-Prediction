ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
convince
the
court
that
this
case
represents
a
threat
to
all
manner
of
ceremonial
traditions
in
this
country,
the
petitioners
ignore
an
essential
fact
of
this
case.
and
that
is
that
this
case
deals
with
school
prayer
at
a
public
school
function
that
is
run
by
public
school
teachers
and
officials,
and
that's
organized
for
the
purpose
of
honoring
public
school
students.
none
of
the
examples
which
the
petitioners
or
the
government
have
suggested
are
comparable
here
occur
in
the
public
school
setting.
all
of
the
examples--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
two
distinctions
there.
one
is
that
the
courtroom
opening
does
not
occur
in
a
public
school.
and
this
court
has
always,
in
every
case
that
it
has
addressed
the
interaction
of
religion
and
public
school
officials,
accorded
special
concern
to
that
kind
of
interaction.
secondly,
the
opening
of
court
is
a
very...
it's
more
like
the
marsh
kind
of
analysis.
it's...
first
of
all,
it
has
a
very
longstanding
history,
and
secondly,
it's
become
a
rote
kind
of
thing.
so
that
the
perception
of
a
reasonable
observer,
i
would
suggest,
is
different.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
no,
your
honor.
but
i
do
not
think
that
public
school--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--it
does
not
mean...
it
does
not
mean
that
students
cannot
be
brought
in
to
watch
the
court
sessions--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--i
think
that
it
is...
yes,
i
think
that
the
public
school
can
bring
their
students--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--yes,
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
think
that
prayers
at
graduation
are
by
any
means
rote.
even
within
the
city
of
providence,
half
of
the
schools...
half
of
the
middle
schools
and
high
schools
did
not
include
prayer
in
their
graduation
ceremonies
prior
to
the
district
court's
injunction
in
this
case.
so
the...
the
kind
of
tradition
that
you're
talking
about
is
completely
different.
there
is
not
the
history.
there
is
not
the
automatic
kind
of
roteness
that...
that
i
think...
that
this
court's
opening
suggests.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
think
that
public
school
education,
as
this
court
has
already
recognized,
doesn't
fall
into
the
marsh
kind
of
analysis
to
begin
with,
because
the
facts
relating
to
the
history
of
public
education
are
different
than
the
facts
relating
to
legislative
prayer.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
i
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
what
you
still
have
in
that
case,
is
part
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
is
that
the
public
school
officials
have
chosen
a
particular
clergy
to
come
in,
knowing
that
that
clergy
is
going
to
give
a
message
promoting
religion.
it
is
still
a
public
school
function
that
is
inherently
part
of
the
whole
public
school
educational
process.
and
the
message
that's
conveyed
to
students
is
that
government
is
sponsoring
a
religious
organization's
religious
message.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
no,
your
honor,
absolutely--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--i
think
that
it
is
not
prohibited
for
the
school
to
invite
anyone
that
it
chooses
to
be
a
commencement
speaker.
i
think
that
the
problem
arises,
for
purposes
of
the
establishment
clause,
when
the
school
does
so,
either
approving
or
with
the
tacit
understanding
that
that
speaker
is
going
to
deliver
a
prayer.
for
a
commencement--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--yes,
your
honor--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--i
think,
your
honor,
under
any
test
that
the
court
has
adopted,
that
this
practice
violates
the
establishment
clause.
under
the
endorsement
test,
i
think
that
the
clear
message
that
is
being
given
to
students
is
public
school
teachers
are
picking
a
clergy.
that
clergy
is
delivering--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--under
the
coercion
test
that
the...
that
was
set
forth
in
the
allegheny
dissent,
i
think
yes,
your
honor
there
is
definitely
coercion
here.
there
is
no
difference
here
than--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--there
is
no
difference,
your
honor,
between
voluntary
prayer
in
the
classroom,
between
the
fact
situations
of
abington,
the
fact
situations
of
karen
b.,
where
children
were
not
required
to
be
present
in
the
first
place,
they
could
opt
into
the
prayer
session;
from
the
situation
in
engel
where
children
were
allowed
to
be
excused,
and
there
is
in
this
situation.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
in
this
situation?
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
yes,
i
think
there
is
both.
i
think
that
the
child
who
was
in--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--pardon?
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
no,
your
honor,
but
in
this
particular
case,
deborah
weisman
was
14
years
old
when
this
graduation
occurred.
she
was
leaving
the
eighth
grade
of
a
public
school
going
into
the
ninth
grade
of
another
public
school.
to
suggest
that
there
is
no
continuity
there,
that
somehow
this
one
day
of
graduation
she
was
different...
she
was
not
subject
to
peer
pressure,
she
was
not
subject
to
the
pressure
that
comes
from
looking
at
schoolteachers
as
authority
figures
and
as
persons
to
emulate...
to
suggest
that
there
is
some
magical
difference
between
this
one
day
is
totally
unrealistic.
this
day
was--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
this
is
a
situation
where
people
are
voluntarily
seeking
to
invoke
god.
this
is
a
ceremony
that
is
directed
to
children,
that
is
developed
for
the
purpose
of
honoring
children
at
a
very
important
day
of
their
lives.
they
do--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--i
think
it
is
different,
your
honor,
for
the
same
reasons
that
this
court
has
always
accorded
a
different
level
of
scrutiny
to
public
school
situations.
we
do,
in
fact,
have
here
a
situation
where
the
children
all
walked
into
the
graduation
together.
they
were
not
seated
with
their
parents.
they
were
seated
together.
they
were
asked
to
stand
to
say
the
pledge
of
allegiance.
and
they
remained
standing
for
purposes
of
listening
to
the
invocation.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
it
is
not,
your
honor.
this
record
was
submitted
on
an
agreed
statement
of
facts.
and
the
city,
below--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--it
is
not,
your
honor.
the
city
never
argued
a
coercion
argument,
either
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
or
before
the
district
court.
so
there
was
never
a
reason
to
raise
the
coercion...
the
facts
related
to
coercion
at
those
levels.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
no,
your
honor.
the
record--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--the
record
goes
beyond
this
particular
graduation
and
deals
with
all
of
the
middle
schools
and
high
schools
in
the
city
of
providence.
and
the
record
states
that
out
of
11
middle
schools
and
high
schools,
in
the
5
years
preceding
this
graduation,
six
of
those
schools
routinely
included--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--it
does
not,
your
honor.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
it
does
not,
your
honor.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
that's
true,
your
honor.
from
the
record
you
don't
know
that.
not
only
does
the
city's
argument
ignore
the
essential
nature
of
this
case,
but
the
city
urges
an
interpretation
of
the
establishment
clause
which
would
set
the
stage
for
radical
changes
in
the
relationship
between
government
officials
and
religious
institutions.
the
coercion
test
that
the
city
suggests
has
been
repeatedly
rejected
by
this
court
because
in
its
brief,
the
city
suggests
that
the
establishment
clause
proscribes
only
the
use
of
government
force
or
funds
to
aid
or
inhibit
religious
practices.
indeed,
in
its
brief,
the
city
openly
suggests
that
government
officials
may
participate
in
religious
debate,
and
that
government
speech
cannot
amount
to
coercion
of
religious...
religious
liberty
to
the
extent
that
the
establishment
clause
is
implicated.
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
standard
that
the
city
proposes,
then
graduation
ceremonies
in
public
schools
could
open
with
a
roman
catholic
mass.
and
as
long
as
the
graduation
ceremony
was
voluntary
in
the
sense
that
children
were
not
obligated
to
attend,
then
that
would...
that
practice
would
pass
establishment
clause
muster.
in
fact,
if
the
city's
argument
were
adopted,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
a
government
official
from
standing
up
and
saying
that
this
is
a
christian
country
and
that
non-christians
are
doomed
to
everlasting
damnation.
if
speech
alone,
absent
compelled
attendance,
does
not
warrant
the
protection
of
the
establishment
clause,
then
decades
worth
of
cases
which
this
court
has
decided,
dealing
with
prayer
in
the
public
school
setting,
must
fall;
abington
v.
schempp,
engel
v.
vitale--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
reconsider
those
decisions,
your
honor--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
taking
marsh,
as
an
example,
that
the
facts
in
marsh
are
radically
different
from
the
facts
of
a
graduation
ceremony
in
a
public
school.
the
legislators,
first
of
all,
were
participants
in
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
include
prayer.
the
legislative
sessions
are
much
less
controlled
than
are
graduation
ceremonies.
legislators
can
walk
in
and
out
as
they
please...
and
they
do
walk
in
and
out
as
they
please.
legislators
are
adults.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
well,
your
honor--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--i
am
not
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
the
court
adopt
a
different
test
than
it
has
used
over
the
last
several
decades.
the
court
has
routinely
addressed
difficult
questions...
some
dealing
with
old
traditions,
some
dealing
with
newer
situations...
and
has
reconciled
those
traditions
under
the
lemon
test.
but
i
do
suggest
to
the
court
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
examine
this
particular
set
of
facts
under
a
coercion
argument,
that
in
fact
what
the
school
department
did
here
was
coercive
towards
the
graduating
children,
just
as
the
voluntary
prayer
in
the
classroom
is
coercive.
the
mere
fact
that
this
is
removed
from
a
classroom
and
takes
place
at
a
public
school
function
instead
of
in
the
school
building
on
a
class
day
doesn't
change
the
essential
nature
of
the
case.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
it
is
a
combination,
your
honor,
of
all
of
those
factors.
this,
in
a
sense,
all
of
the
establishment
clause
cases
that
this
court
deals
with
are
fact-specific.
they
depend...
as
an
example,
in
county
of
allegheny...
they
depend
on
the
specific
facts
that
are
before
the
court.
and
this
case,
yes,
you
have
schoolchildren
who
are
more
impressionable
than
adults,
you
have
schoolchildren
who
are
part
of
the
public
school
and
public
education
arena
and
are
subject
to
pressure
from
teachers,
and
who
use
teachers
as
role
models.
you
have,
in
addition
to
that,
you
have
the
fact
that
a
school's
generally...
and
graduation
ceremonies
in
particular...
are
much
more
controlled.
the
students
have
no
authority
to
control
what
happens
at
a
graduation
ceremony.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
i
think,
your
honor,
that
may
be
a
closer
case.
but
i
still
think
that
if
you
analyze
that
case
under
the
traditional
tests
that
this
court
has
used,
and
under
the
endorsement
test,
that
the
message
that's
being
conveyed
to
the
audience
is
still
a
message
that
government
officials
are
supporting
and
endorsing
and
favoring
religious
expression.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
yes,
your
honor...
i
am
resting
on
the
traditional
court...
the
traditional
test
that
this
court
has
always
applied
in
school
cases,
in
combination
with
the
endorsement
test.
but
i
am
also
saying
that
it
is
coercive
here.
so
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
the
coercion
test...
not
the
coercion
test
which
the
city
has
suggested,
because
in
that
case,
decades
worth
of
cases
would
fall,
and
there
are
many,
many
situations
that
this
court
has
held
violate
the
establishment
clause
that
would
not
under
the
city's
test,
even
sectarian
prayer,
as
the
court
raised
earlier.
but
under
the...
the...
under
the
coercion
test
that
acknowledges
that
coercion
can
be
very
subtle,
that
it
is
not
simply
limited
to
is
a
citizen
forced
to
pay
money
to
support
a
church,
or
is
a
citizen
forced
to
stand
there
and
participate
in
a
religious
exercise.
under
an
analysis
of
coercion
that
takes
into
account
the
subtle
kinds
of
pressures
that
can
be
exerted
on
people...
and
particularly
on
children...
then
yes,
i
think
that
the
practice
here
was
coercive.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
i
think
that
a
coercion
test
applied
to
college
seniors
would
be
a
closer
case,
and
would
need
to...
would
need
to
depend
more
on
the
facts.
but
i
think
under
the
endorsement--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--there
is,
your
honor,
because
part
of
the
endorsement
test
depends
on
the
perception
of
the
audience.
and
what
a
reasonable
person
in
the
audience
would
perceive
is
the
message
that
is
being
promoted.
and
in
this
case,
the
audience
is
primarily
schoolchildren.
and
they
are...
the
audience--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
in
a
college
graduation.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
i
think
the
message
to
college
seniors,
your
honor,
would
still
remain
under
the
endorsement
test,
that
the
school
officials
that
are...
that
are
putting
on
and
organizing
the
graduation,
if
they
are
choosing
a
clergyman,
as
happened
in
this
case,
if
they
are
suggesting
to
the
clergyman...
as
happened
in
this
case
also...
the
school
officials
told
the
clergyman
what
kind
of
prayer
he
could
say.
i
don't
know
how
you
could
avoid
saying
that
that
is
endorsement.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
yes.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
i
think
that
the
question,
with
regard
to
college
seniors,
your
honor,
is
closer
on
the
coercion
test.
and
i'm
not
prepared...
without...
i
think
that,
again,
the
court
would
have
to
look
at
the
specific
facts
of
that
case
that
was
before
them.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
yes,
your
honor,
i
am
urging
the
court--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--no,
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
i--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
lemon
test
has,
in
essence,
stood
the
test
of
time.
although
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
apply,
i
don't
think
the
coercion
test
is
any
easier
to
apply.
the
court,
in
the
area
of
criminal
law,
for
example,
has
always
wrestled
with
the
issue
of
when
a
confession
is
coerced
and
when
it
is
voluntary.
and
even
in
that
scenario,
the
age
of
the
people
involved
is
important.
i
think
that
the
national
school
board
association
makes
the
point
better
than
i
could
make
it
in
its
amicus
brief,
which
is
that
if
this
court...
that
school
officials
and
communities
and
parents
have
relied
on
this
court's
analysis
under
the
lemon
test
for
decades.
and
if
this
court
were
to
not
rely
on
the
lemon
court...
test
in
this
case,
that
what
it
would
be
doing
is
making
all
of
the
religion
in
the
school
cases
for
the
last
several
decades
suspect.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
i
think,
your
honor,
that
both
under
the
purpose
prong
of
the
lemon
test
and
under
the
effect
prong
of
the
lemon
test,
that
this
practice
must
fall
under
the
establishment
clause.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
pardon,
your
honor?
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
yes,
the
court
below
addressed
the
effects
argument,
and
did
not
address
the
purpose
argument.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
the
court
looks
at
the
effect
test
in
concert
with
the
overtones
of
endorsement,
the
message
that
the
school
committee--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--yes,
your
honor...
i
think
if
the
court
looks
at
the
effect
test
as
it
has
been
interpreted
in
recent
cases,
in
concert
with
the
endorsement
test,
and
understanding--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--well,
your
honor--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--the
way
that
i
am--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--well,
i
understand...
the
way
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
it
is
that
the
court
views
the
endorsement
test
as
part
of
the
effects
prong
of
the
lemon
test.
and
i
think
that
the
message
that
is
conveyed,
the
effect
of
having
a
school
prayer...
a
prayer
delivered
at
a
public
school
function,
that
the
effect
and
the
message
that's
conveyed
to
the
primary
audience...
which
is
the
schoolchildren...
is
that
public
school
officials
are
not
only
endorsing
religion,
they're
endorsing
a
particular
religious
message
that
is
being
delivered
by
this
particular
clergy
whom
they
have
chosen.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
your
honor,
under
either
analysis,
i
think
that
the
primary
purpose
and
effect
in
this
case,
of
the
school
department's
practice,
is
to
advance
religion.
there
is
nothing
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
that
was
submitted
to
the
court
below
that
suggests
the
government's
purpose
in
including
prayer
in
part
of
the
school's
commencement
exercises,
and
not
including
them
in
other
of
the
school's
commencement
exercises.
the
government
makes
the
argument
that
by
including
prayer
they
are
merely
acknowledging
religious
tradition.
however,
this
court
has
always
recognized
the
fact
that
prayer
is
the...
is
inherently
religious.
it's
not
simply
a
passive
acknowledgement,
as
the
display
of
a
nativity
scene,
or
the
display
or
a
menorah
may,
in
some
circumstances,
be
passive
acknowledgement.
it
is
active.
it
is
worship.
to
say
that
any
vocal
prayer
is
merely
an
acknowledgement
of
religious
traditions
is
to
diminish
the
value
of
that
prayer.
furthermore,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
possible
to
devise
a
nonsectarian
prayer
that
covers
all
people
and
all
religious
beliefs.
this
country
has
become
so
much
more
diverse
than
it
was
when
it
was
founded
in
terms
of
the
religious
beliefs
of
its
citizens
that
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
devise
a
prayer
which
encompasses
the
beliefs
of
all
of
those
citizens.
with
regard
to
the
effect
of
including
a
prayer,
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
message
that
must
be
given
by
public
school
teachers
who
have
chosen
a
particular
clergyperson
and
have
brought
him
into
a
public
school
function
to
deliver
a
prayer
is
that
the
public
school
is...
at
the
very
least...
saying
that
prayer
is
a
preferred
practice.
and
by
doing
so,
they
are
giving
a
message
to
nonadherents
and
nonbelievers
that
their
religious
beliefs
are
not
as
important,
that
they
are
outsiders,
and
that
the
public
school
system
does
not
belong
to
them
in
the
same
way
that
it
belongs
to
believers.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
a
thanksgiving...
i
think
under
its
facts,
your
honor,
a
thanksgiving
proclamation
is
much
different
than
a
prayer
which
is
delivered
to
a
specific
audience
of
children
in
a
school
setting
which
is
as
controlled
as
this
one.
the
thanksgiving
proclamation
is
not
really
delivered
to
any
specific
audience.
in
fact,
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
anyone
that
would
have
standing
to
bring
such
a
case
before
the
court.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
your
honor,
i
think
that,
again,
there
are
some
marsh
elements,
or
in
some
sense
the
thanksgiving
proclamation
is
more
like
marsh
and
has
some
more
of
the
elements
of
marsh
than
this
particular
case
does.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
message
that
is
being
given
to
the
audience,
the
primary
audience,
the
whole
set
of
facts
around
a
graduation
ceremony
are
relevant
to
the
endorsement
inquiry.
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
the
audience--
ms.
sandra
a.
blanding
--i
do,
your
honor.
again,
i
think
this
case
is
essentially
a
school
prayer
case.
and
it
must
be
looked
at
in
that
context,
as
this
court
has
always
looked
at
cases
dealing
with
the
interaction
of
religion
in
the
schools
in
a
special
context.
thank
you.
