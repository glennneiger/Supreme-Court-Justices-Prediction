justice
scalia
big
hard-hearted
employer,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
so
they
knew
that
they
parked
there.
justice
scalia
but
they
still
couldn't
reach
them
there,
right,
unless...
unless
they
went
onto
the
land?
justice
scalia
every
car
was
4
feet
from
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you'd...
you'd
say
expense
has
some
bearing
as
to
reasonable.
i
mean,
if
the
only
way
to
get
to
them
is
to
hire
private
detectives
to
find
out
where
they
live
and
one
by
one
approach
them
in
that
fashion,
that
might
not
be
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
they
don't
want
to,
you
say
that
they
must
be
given
this
information,
even
if
they
don't
want
the
information?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it's
only
employees'
rights...
as
you
say,
section
7
is
only
rights
of
employees.
it
does
not
give
rights
to
nonemployees,
it
does
not
give
rights
to
organizers.
the
only
thing
we're
talking
about
here
are
rights
of
employees
to
receive
information.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
they
have
a
right...
a
right
to
receive
information,
even
information
they
don't
want
to
receive,
and
we're
going
to
sort
of
force-feed
them.
i...
that's
a
very
strange
right
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
yes,
it
is.
they
see
the
sign.
it
says,
there's
a
meeting
for
this
information.
they
say,
i
don't
want
to
go
to
the
meeting.
i
don't
want
to
go
to
the
meeting.
you
say
that's
not
adequate.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
they
don't
want
to
hear.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
if
we're
talking
about
employee's
rights...
and
that's
how
the
statute
reads.
it
talks
about
the
right
of
employees.
why
isn't
that
adequately
satisfied
so
long
as
the
employer
is
not
keeping
employees
from
obtaining
information
that
they
want
to
receive,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
adequately
done
when
he
allow...
you
know,
he's
not
blocking
off
the
pickets
so
that
they
couldn't
see
those
signs
on
the...
on
the
grassy
strip.
justice
scalia
because
it...
because
it
had
been
delivered
through...
through
trespass,
because
the
people
who
passed
it
out
had
no
right
to
be
on
the...
on
the
property.
justice
scalia
of
course
it
is.
justice
scalia
and
calling
to
them
from
a
grass
strip
is
not
in
person?
hello,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
union,
and
the
person
says,
i
don't
want
to
hear
it,
that
is
not
in
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
might...
right,
but
i
mean
that
might
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we're
not
talking
about
that,
to
try
to
eject
them
from
public
property.
but
assuming
that
they're
on
public
property
and
can...
we
know
the
distances
here...
could
shout
at
the
people
getting
out
of
the
cars,
we
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
union.
that
would
not
constitute
a
personal
contact?
i
mean,
what
does
it
take
to
constitute
a
personal
contact?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
think
what
it
goes
to
is...
i
do
think
you're
saying
what
the
board
desires,
and
that
is
that
there
be
more
than
just
an
opportunity
afforded
to
the
employee
either
in
person
or
by
advertisement
to
get
information
that
the
employee
wants.
i
think,
as
you
say,
the...
the
information
must
be
given
to
the
employee,
whether
the
employee
wants
to
hear
it
or
not,
and
unless
there's
some
opportunity
for
that,
you
just
simply
don't
think
it's
adequate
access.
is
that...
is
that
an
unfair
characterization?
justice
scalia
well,
that
isn't
the
point,
whether
it's
access
from
public
property.
the
point
is
whether
it
is
enough
access
to
give
the
employee
the
clear
notice
that
the
information
is
available
and
let
him
say
that
he
wants
to
receive
it
or
doesn't
want
to
receive
it.
is
that
enough
access?
justice
scalia
but
communicating
what?
communicating,
i'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
the
union,
and
if
the
employee
said,
you
know,
to
the
person
at
the
door
or
on
the
street,
i
don't
want
to
hear
it--
justice
scalia
--so
that
presumably
would
work
from
the
parking
lot
as
well.
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
union,
and
the
person
says,
i
don't
want
to
hear
it.
you
say
that...
that
would
be
enough.
justice
scalia
holding
up
a
sign,
though,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
union,
and
the
person
says,
i
don't
want
to
hear
it,
that...
that's...
that
doesn't
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
may
i...
justice
kennedy
may
not
think
it's
not...
it's
not
an
unreasonable
rule,
but
hasn't
the
court
suggested
that
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
rule
in
the...
in
the
language
from
sears
that
your
colleague
referred
us
to,
where...
where
we
did
seem
to
establish...
it's
dictum,
to
be
sure,
but
it
reflects
our
understanding
of
babcock
&
wilcox.
we
did
seem
to
say
that
you
don't
weigh
the
reasonableness
of
access
together
with
the
degree
of
infringement
on
property
rights.
it
seemed
to
be
a
preliminary
inquiry.
we
said,
to
gain
access
the
union
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
no
other
reasonable
means
of
communicating
its
organizational
methods
exists.
the
burden
is
a
heavy
one
and
has
rarely
been
in
favor
of
trespassory
organizational
activity.
that
statement
could
certainly
not
be
made
if
we
accept
the
board's
action
in
the
present
case.
you
could
certainly--
justice
scalia
--not
say
that
the
burden
is
rarely
in
favor
of
trespassory
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
make
sure
i...
is
this
an
unfair
characterization
of
what
i
think
the
board
is
saying?
let's
assume
that
through
various
means
union
organizers
can
reach
60
percent
of
the
people
in
the
shop
they're
trying
to
organize.
as
i
understand
the
board,
the
board
is
saying
that
that
can
be
reasonably
effective
access
to
those
employees
in
some
cases,
namely
where
the
employer
does
not
have
a
building
open
to
the
public,
but
that
is
not
reasonably
effective
access
to
the
employees
in
another
case...
60
percent
is
good
in
one
case
and
not
good
in
the
other.
