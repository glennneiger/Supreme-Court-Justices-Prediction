mr.
robert
p.
joy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
question
presented
is
whether
an
employer
may
legitimately
bar
nonunion...
nonemployee
union
organizers
from
trespassing
on
its
private
property
to
seek
to
organize
its
employees
when
reasonable
alternative
means
of
reaching
them
are
available.
this
court,
in
nlrb
v.
babcock
&
wilcox,
a
unanimous
opinion
in
1956,
held
that
an
employer
may,
in
those
circumstances,
preserve
his
private
property
rights
and
exclude
the
union.
in
this
case,
a
divided
panel
of
the
first
circuit
with
a
strong
dissent
endorsing
a
ruling
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
held
to
the
contrary.
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
the
first
circuit
should
be
reversed,
and
in
so
doing
this
court
should
reaffirm
its
holding
in
nlrb
v.
babcock
&
wilcox.
petitioner
submits
these
principal
arguments
where
lechmere
v.
the
national
labor
relations
board
should
be
reversed.
first,
the
first
circuit
endorsed
the
board's
decisional
model
enunciated
in
jean
country,
which
rests
upon
an
erroneous
legal
foundation.
by
taking
the
threshold
inquiry
into
whether
reasonable
alternative
means
of
reaching
employees
through
the
usual
channels
of
communication
exist
before
trespass
will
be
authorized
and
denoting
that
inquiry
in
the
analysis
to
one
of
three
factors
of
seemingly
equal
standing,
the
analytical
regime
fashioned
by
this
court
in
babcock
&
wilcox
is
dismantled
and
the
private
property
rights
of
the
employer
are
substantially
diminished
and
oftentimes
destroyed.
a
second
principal
argument
that
we
submit
to
the
court
why
the
first
circuit
should
be
reversed
is
that
the
first
circuit
and
the
board,
while
paying
lip
service
to
the
holding
of
babcock
&
wilcox
that
so
long
as
there
are
reasonable
alternative
means
available
to
the
union
to
reach
the
employees,
no
trespass
should
be
authorized,
nonetheless
allowed
the
union's
effectiveness
in
persuading
employees
as
opposed
to
reaching
employees
to
become
a
factor
in
judging
whether
trespass
is
warranted.
third,
the
first
circuit
endorsed
the
board's
creation
of
an
impermissibly
low
standard
for
establishing
that
the
use
of
alternative
communications
methods
is
not
reasonable.
in
sears
&
roebuck
v.
san
diego
council
of
carpenters,
this
court
stated
that
the
burden
of
proving
that
trespass
is
necessary
is
a
heavy
one.
in
lechmere,
the
first
circuit
and
the
board,
we
submit,
in
addition
to
allowing
unfounded
inferences,
conjecture,
and
partial
facts
to
satisfy
this
heavy
burden,
has
given
strong
indications
that
a
new
and
impermissibly
easy
standard
for
unreasonableness
of
a
communication
method
has
emerged
by
describing
accessibility
to
the
work
force
in
terms
of
whether
a
union
can
obtain
the
names
and
addresses
of
employees
through
an
employer-furnished
list
or
otherwise.
briefly,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows,
your
honors.
the
petitioner
lechmere,
a
retailer,
opened
a
store
in
newington,
connecticut,
employing
200
employees.
it
established
a
no-solicitation,
no-access
rule,
and
consistently
and
unfailingly
enforced
that
rule
by
prohibiting
all
efforts
at
solicitation,
including
the
salvation
army
bell-ringer
during
the
holiday
season,
the
girl
scouts
of
america,
burger
king,
the
american
automobile
association,
and
so
on.
on
june
16,
198--
mr.
robert
p.
joy
--your
honor,
i
would
respond
by
saying
that
it's
an
indication
of
just
how
strongly
this
employer
has
asserted
its
private
property
interest.
on
june
16,
1987,
the
united
food
and
commercial
workers
began
a
campaign
to
organize
the
employees
at
lechmere
by
first
putting
a
full-page
ad
in
the
hartford
courant
newspaper,
which
is
the
largest
newspaper
in
the
area
of
daily
circulation.
the
ad,
by
the
way,
was
aimed
directly
at
the
employees.
a
copy
of
one
is
attached
to
the
joint
appendix.
it
was
aimed
directly
at
lechmere
employees,
and
it
contained
a
clip-out
authorization
card
with
a
self-addressed
card
for
return.
two
days
later,
on
june
18th,
the
union
began
a
series
of
trespassory
forays
into
the
store
and
the
parking
lot
of
lechmere,
stuffing
union
literature
inside
merchandise
and
in
the
restrooms
and
handbilling
in
the
parking
lot,
including
the
employee
section
of
the
parking
lot,
which
was
closest
to
a
46-foot-wide
public
grass
strip
that
separated
the
parking
lot
from
the
berlin
turnpike.
forty-two
feet
of
that
grass
strip
is
public
land,
meaning
that
the
union
organizers
were
able
to
come
within
4
feet
of
where
the
employees
parked
in
that
section
of
the
parking
lot.
the
employees
arrived
one-half
hour
before
the
store
opened,
and
they
left
one-half
hour
after
the
store
closed.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
it
was
true
of
most
of
them,
your
honor.
the
testimony
in
the
record
indicates
that
the
union
was
aware
that
the
employees
generally
parked
in
that
section
of
the
parking
lot.
in
fact,
may
i
quote
the
testimony
of
union
organizer
lisa
meucci,
who
was
asked
this
question
by
counsel
for
the
general
counsel
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
what
steps
did
you
take
to
ensure
or
attempt
to
ensure
that
leaflets
reached
the
particular
audience?
answer:
arriving
at
the
store
between
9:15
and
9:30,
making
sure
that
people
who
parked
their
cars
were
employees.
the
stores
opened
at
10:00,
so
most
people
that
arrived
at
the
store
between
9:30
and
10:00
were
employees.
the
testimony
of
the
union
itself.
there's
no
question
but
that
the
union
was
aware
that
the
majority
of
the
employees
parked
in
that
section,
which
was
accessible
within
4
feet
by
public
land.
on
june
20th,
the
organizers
again
made
three
intrusions
into
the
parking
lot
and
handbilled.
the
company's
invocation
of
its
no-solicitation
rule
against
the
union
led
to
the--
mr.
robert
p.
joy
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
they...
they
could
not
walk
up
and
touch
them,
your
honor,
but
they
certainly,
within
4
feet,
a
distance
greater
than
separates
you
and
i,
could
beckon
them
to
come
over,
all
the
while
saying,
i
have
a
piece
of
literature
here
that
you
should
be
interested
in.
please
come
over
and
talk
with
me
further
about
it.
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
short
4
feet
distance
should
not
rise
to
the
level
of
making
them
inaccessible.
indeed,
your
honor,
there
were
other--
mr.
robert
p.
joy
--no,
your
honor,
but
the...
the
length
of
property
that
bordered
on
berlin
turnpike
was
several
hundred
feet
in
length,
and
the
employees,
while
they
all
didn't,
in
one
single
line,
up
against
that
section
of
public
land,
park,
nonetheless,
i
think
that
the
testimony
indicates
that
there
may
have
been
only
two
or
three
rows
of
cars,
but
certainly
that
first
row
of
cars
was
within
4
feet.
and
by
the
way,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
only
method
of
reaching
the
employees
that
was
available
to
the
employees
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
will
do
that
now.
the
employees,
for
the
next
month
and
a
half
after
the
organizational
campaign
began,
gathered
the
names
and
addresses
of
license
plates
of...
gathered
the
names
and
addresses
of
employees
through
the
taking
down
of
license
plate
numbers,
and
going
down
the
street
a
few
miles
to
the
connecticut
division
of
motor
vehicles,
which...
it
would
give
them
the
names
and
addresses
of
those
to
whom
the
car
was
registered.
that
was
public
information
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
the
union
employed
that
method
to
obtain
the
names
of
49
employees.
it
determined
after
speaking
with
an
employee,
with
the
help
of
an
employee
of
lechmere,
that
8
of
those
49
employees
were
supervisors.
thus,
they
plugged
the
names
of
41
of
the
200
lechmere
employees
into
their
computer,
and
then
generated
four
pieces
of
mailing
to
each
of
those
homes.
those
mailings
included
a
stamped
self-addressed
envelope.
each
of
those
mailings
exhorted
the
lechmere
employees,
if
they
had
an
interest
in
improving
their
wages
and
benefits
in
terms
of
conditions
of
employment,
to
return
that
clip-out.
in
addition,
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
that
none
of
those
mailings
were
returned
to
the
union
addressee
unknown.
there
was
no
indication
that
these
four
mailings
did
not
get
through
to
these
employees.
in
addition
to
the
mailings,
the
union
made
roughly
10
telephone
calls
to
employees,
and
they
made
only
two
home
visits.
the
union
doesn't
explain
why
they
only
attempted
two
home
visits.
they
placed
five
more
ads
in
the
newspaper,
four
of
them
full-page
ads
and
one
half-page
ad,
one
in
the
new
britain
herald
and
the
other
in
the
hartford
courant.
in
addition,
for
a
month
straight,
this
union
picketed
again
on
that
grass
strip,
which
allowed
them
to
come
within
4
feet
of
the
employees'
section
of
the
parking
lot,
picketed
for
a
month
straight,
and
then
for
the
next
6
months
intermittently...
now,
that
picketing
switched
its
target
from
the
organization
of
the
employees
to
an
area
standards
kind
of
a
picket,
but
nonetheless,
the
employees
every
day
when
they
came
saw
those
pickets
for
a
month
and
then
intermittently
for
6
months.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
p.
joy
that's
correct,
the
board
so
found,
your
honor,
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
they
applied
an
erroneous
legal
standard
in
defining
what
reasonable
alternative
means
were.
we
submit
that
what
the
board
was
saying
and...
and
applying
here
was
a
standard
under
which
the...
the
union
must
be
effective,
must
have
reasonable
alternative
means
which
are
effective
in
persuading
the
employees,
as
opposed
to
effective
in
merely
reaching
them,
and
the
babcock
command,
the
command
that
this
court
gave
in
nlrb
v.
babcock
&
wilcox
in
1956
was
that
the
available
methods
need
only
be
effective
in
reaching
employees,
not
persuading
employees.
indeed,
your
honor,
the
court
in
babcock
denied
enforcement
of
a
board
order,
and
the
underlying
board
decision
found
that
there
were
no
reasonable
alternative
means
of
communication
because
the
methods
of
communication
in
the
board's
babcock
case
were
not...
were
in...
were
not
as
effective
as
placing
the
employees...
the
union
organizers,
i
should
say,
on
the
employer's
property.
the
court,
while
stating
that
the
trespass
that
was
authorized
in
babcock
was
minimal
and
not
unreasonable,
nonetheless
rejected
the
board's
interpretation
of
that
rule
of
law
and
said
that
more
effective
means
isn't
the
issue.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
reasonable
alternative
means
are
available
by
the
usual
methods
of
communication,
and
the
court
cited
as
the
usual
methods
of
communication
telephone
calls,
home
visits,
advertised
meetings,
and
the
like,
and
it
appears
in
footnote
1,
i
believe,
of
the
babcock
supreme
court
decision.
it...
it
also
referred
in
babcock
not
just
to
the
usual
methods
of
communication
but
the
usual
ways
of
imparting
information.
in
this
case,
the
board
and
the
first
circuit
endorsing
the
board,
i
believe,
has
misunderstood
that
rule
of
law
that
was
enunciated
respecting
reasonable
alternative
means.
it...
indeed,
in
the
board's
own
brief
to
this
court
on
page
11,
it
talks
about
the
paraphrasing...
or,
i
should
say
it
paraphrased
babcock
&
wilcox
by
talking
about
the
effectively
engaging
in
organizational
activity.
that
connotes
to
me
that
the
definition,
the
interpretation,
is
one
where
they
are
convinced
that
the
effectiveness
means
effectiveness
in
persuading
and
not
reaching.
the
summary
dismissal
of
mass
media
by
the
board
in
jean
country,
endorsed
by
the
first
circuit,
where
the
board
says,
only
in
the
exceptional
case
will
we
consider
mass
media
to
be
an
appropriate
available
method
of
communication.
and
as
judge
torruella
said
in
his
dissent,
in
one
clean
swoop
the
board
and
the
first
circuit
have
eliminated
the
very
tools
used
by
the
entire
advertising
and
political
industry
to
reach
its
targeted
audience,
and
without
any
evidence
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
employees
were
not
reached
by
these
mass
media
attempts,
the
board
summarily
dismisses
the
very
same
method
of
communication
that
the
union
began
its
campaign
with,
and--
mr.
robert
p.
joy
--it
said,
your
honor,
that
in
most
cases
it
will
be
considered
expensive
or
ineffective,
and
i
believe
that's
further
indication
that
they
misconstrue
the
word
effective
to
mean,
effective
in
persuading
as
opposed
to
effective
in
reaching.
they
also
placed
an
expense
component
on
it,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
in
this
case
the
union
certainly
did
not
apparently
consider
that
method
of
communication
expensive.
indeed,
as
i
said,
it
utilized
that
method
six
times.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
first
argument
that
i
mentioned,
and
that
is
that
by
relying
on
the
jean
country
test
the...
the
supreme...
the
first
circuit
relied
on
a
legal
erroneous
foundation
which
fails
to
follow
the
applicable
law.
as
i
mentioned,
this
was
a
unanimous
opinion
by
eight
justices
in
1956,
and
it
construed
the
act
and
fashioned
the
legal
rule
that
governs
nonemployees
seeking
to
trespass
on
an
employer's
property
as
distinguished
from
employees,
and
that
rule
prohibited
trespassing
except
where
the
target
employees
were
inaccessible
and
beyond
the
reach
of
less
intrusive
nontrespassory
means.
we...
i
submit
to
you,
your
honor,
that
the
babcock
court
placed
a
sentinel
at
the
boundary
of
the
private
property,
and
that
sentinel
was
a
threshold
inquiry...
prove
to
me
you
have
no
reasonable
available
other
means
before
i
must
let
you
by
onto
my
property.
by
reducing
that
inquiry
to
a
relative
contest
among
three
of
coequal
status,
the
board
and
the
first
circuit
endorsing
the
board
has
taken
that
sentinel
off
his
post
guarding
the
property.
i...
perhaps,
if
i
may
mix
my
metaphors,
a
little
historical
context
of
this
most
recent
test
enunciated
by
the
board
is
helpful.
two
years
prior
to
jean
country...
and
by
the
way,
jean
country
was
decided
in
1988...
2
years
before
that,
in
fairmont
hotels,
the
board
enunciated
a
test
for
access
by
nonemployees
onto
employers'
private
property,
and
in
that
test
in
fairmont
the
board
said,
we're
going
to...
going
to
balance
the
property
rights
on
the
one
hand
against
the
section
7
right
on
the
other
hand,
and
only
if
they
are
in
equipoise
will
we
then
look
to
reasonable
alternative
available
means.
jean
country
came
along
2
years
later,
and
the
board
apparently
recognized
its
error
and
resurrected
the
threshold
inquiry
in
babcock
from
its
obscurity
and
brought
it
up
to
a
factor
to
be
considered
equally
with
the
other
two.
in
essence,
then,
what
the
board
did
was
it
took
the
horse
from
behind
the
cart
and
put
it
into
the
cart,
and
that's
what
the
first
circuit
adopted
by
endorsing
the
board's
order
in
this
case.
now,
the...
the
supreme
court
decisions
since
babcock
have
bolstered
rather
than
diminished
the
vitality
of
the
rule
of
law
enunciated
in
babcock.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
the...
the
board
has
taken
the...
mandated
the
required
threshold
inquiry
into
whether
reasonable
alternative
means
are
available
to
reach
the
intended
audience
before
we
have
to
consider
when
and
how
much
trespass
is
necessary.
the
board
has
removed
that
threshold
inquiry,
that
protection
against
unnecessary
trespass,
and
that
threshold
inquiry,
that
decisional
regime,
was
dictated
by
this
court
in
babcock
&
wilcox,
i
submit,
justice
white.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
our
proposition,
justice
souter,
is
that
before
any
analysis
of
the
strength
of
the
property
right
versus
the
strength
of
the
section
7
right
in
question
is
to
be
engaged
in,
the
threshold
inquiry
must
first
be
asked
and
answered.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
your
honor,
allow
me
to
respond
by
saying
that
we
read
the
word
reasonable
in
that
context
to
mean
reasonable
in
light
and
in
the
context
of
the
remainder
of
the
opinion...
excuse
me.
and
the
language
in
the
remainder
of
the
opinion
says,
but
when
the
plant
and
the
living
quarters
are
isolated
and
rendered
inaccessible,
then
reasonable
alternative
means
may
not
be
available.
so
in
that
context
of
looking
at
the
isolation
of
the
plant
and
the
living
quarters,
such
as
your
lumber
camps,
your
s&h
grossinger's
hotel,
where
the
employees
live
on
the
premises,
your
husky
oil,
where
employees
of
husky
oil
were
up
in
camp
lonely,
600
miles
on
the
north
slope,
north
of
anchorage,
in
those
contexts...
contexts
is...
is
reasonable
alternative
means
intended
to
be
read,
and
the
word
reasonable
intended
to
be
read?
so
that
i'm
not
suggesting
to
you
that
no...
in
no
case
would
there
be
a
situation
where
access
would
be
required.
i'm
using
the
language
in
the
context
of
babcock
to
define
what
is
reasonable
and
what
is
not.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
i'm
not
submitting
to
the
court,
justice
scalia,
that
as
an
absolute
rule
expense
is
prohibited
from
consideration,
but
using
an
objective
reasonable
standard
as
applied
to
facts
such
as
you
present,
certainly
cost
may
be
one
factor.
but
again--
mr.
robert
p.
joy
--i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
darlington
involved
the
situation
where
nonemployees
were
part
of
the
factual
scenario
of
the
case,
but
let
me
cite
you
to
sears
&
roebuck,
and
the
quotation
appears
on
page
18,
and
this
follows
up
to
your
comment
on
my
earlier
comment
that
subsequent
decisions
have
tended
to
bolster
rather
than
diminish
the
vitality
of
babcock
&
wilcox.
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
we
cite
the
language
in
sears
which
states
as
follows,
if
i
may.
while
there
are
unquestionably
examples
of
trespassory
union
activity
that
might
be
protected
under
section
7,
experience
under
the
act
teaches
that
such
situations
are
rare,
and
that
a
trespass
is
far
more
likely
to
be
unprotected
than
protected.
experience
with
trespassory
organizational
solicitation
by
nonemployees
is
instructive
in
this
regard.
while
babcock
indicates
that
an
employer
may
not
always
bar
nonemployee
union
organizers
from
his
property,
his
right
to
do
so
remains
the
general
rule.
to
gain
access,
the
union
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
no
other
reasonable
means
of
communicating
its
organizational
message
to
employees
exists,
or
that
the
employer's
access
rules
discriminate.
the
burden
is
a
heavy
one,
and
has
rarely
been
in
favor
of
trespassing
organizational--
mr.
robert
p.
joy
--effective
in
persuading,
your
honor,
and
i
would
cite
to
you
the
board's
own
language
in
jean
country,
which
says
that,
most
significantly,
in
determining
the
factors
that
we
will
look
at
in
assessing
reasonable
alternative
means,
most
significantly,
your
honor,
is
the
extent
to
which
exclusive
use
of
the
nontrespassory
alternatives
would
dilute
the
effectiveness
of
the
message.
the--
mr.
robert
p.
joy
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
your
honor,
i
would
in
response
to
your
question
say
that
the
babcock
command
which
struck
this
construction
of
the
act
and
erected
this
analytical
regime
required
that
only
reaching...
only
whether
the
alternative
means
was
effective
in
reaching
the
audience.
now,
someone
who
is
using
your
hypothetical,
crying
in
the
wilderness,
is
not
likely
to
be
reaching
the
audience,
and
no
consideration
of
persuasion
should
fall
into
that
calculus.
finally,
let
me
say,
your
honors,
that
the
board
and
the
first
circuit
rely
on
language
from
hudgens
v.
the
nlrb
as
its
essential
cornerstone
in
justifying
the
jean
country
analytical
model,
and
that
language
states
that
the
locus
of
that
accommodation
between
property
rights
and
section
7
rights
may
fall
at
differing
points
along
the
spectrum
depending
on
the
nature
and
strength
of
the
respective
section
7
right
and
the
private
property
rights
asserted
in
any
given
context.
we
submit
that
this
dictum
may
not
be
lifted
out
of
context
and
used
as
a
springboard
for
circumventing
the
babcock
analytical
model.
as
i've
earlier
stated,
hudgens
falls
in
the
middle
of
the
line
of
supreme
court
cases
reaffirming
the
babcock
formula.
it
comes
before
sears
and
the
language
i
read.
the
plain
language
in
the
sears
opinion
informs
that
language
in
hudgens.
the
hudgens
language
speaking
of
accommodation
between
property
rights
and
section
7
rights
and
placing
the
locus
on
the
spectrum
is
to
be
read
as
the
board's
function
after
the
threshold
inquiry
commanded
by
babcock
has
been
answered
in
the
negative,
and
that's
what
that
language
is
intended
to
mean,
and
if
it's
interpreted
that
way,
it
fits.
if
it's
interpreted
the
way
the
board
asserts,
it
circumvents
the
intention
of
babcock
&
wilcox
and
does
not
fit
neatly
into
the
line
of
cases
i
have
identified.
your
honors,
we
in
conclusion
request
that
the
court
reaffirm
the
holding
of
babcock
&
wilcox.
restore
the
sentinel
of
reasonable
alternative
means
to
its
post,
protecting
private
property
against
unnecessary
trespass
by
nonemployee
union
organizers,
and
reverse
the
first
circuit's
endorsement
of
the
order
of
the
board.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
regard
to
the
last
point
made
by
my
colleague,
let
me
simply
state
that
the...
the
court
did
not
intend,
it
seems
to
me,
that
by
exercising
its
right
to
invite,
that
a
commercial
retailer
suffers
a
self-inflicted
wound
to
the
most
essential
property
right
in
the
bundle
of
property
rights,
the
right
to
exclude,
and
by
relying
on
this
openness
of
property
argument
and
trying
to
establish
that
a
retailer,
particularly,
by
inviting
people
to
shop
somehow
has
given
away
his
right
to
exclude,
i
believe
is
misplaced.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
indeed
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
he
excluded
every
other
trespasser
who
came
on
to
his
property
to
engage
in
activity
inconsistent
with
its
commercial
use.
let
me
finally,
if
i
may,
refer
you
to
the
administrative
law
judge
in
this
case,
who
found
that
reasonable
alternative
means
did
exist
in
this
case.
he
said,
i
would
state
that
the
facts
herein
convince
me
that
reasonable
alternative
means
were
available.
the
employees
were
easily
recognizable
here.
they
parked
in
specific
areas
and
arrived
at
predictable
times.
then
he
went
on
to
state
a
distinction
between
availability
and
reaching
an
availability
and
persuading
by
saying,
even
if
union
representatives
were
unable
to
converse
with
them
prior
to
entering
the
store,
the
union
could
and
did
utilize
the
procedure
of
writing
down
license
plates,
and
went
on
to
say
that
fairmont
does
not
require
the
union
to
be
successful
in
its
contacts
with
employees,
only
that
it
have
reasonable
means
of
communicating
with
them.
mr.
robert
p.
joy
your
honor,
i
can
distinguish
the
courts
of
appeals
cases
that--
mr.
robert
p.
joy
--the
answer
is
no,
your
honor,
but
jean
country,
if
i
may,
has
never
been
squarely
challenged
as
has
been
done
in
the
lechmere
case.
in
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
decisions
up
till
now,
jean
country...
there's
been
no
challenge
launched
against
jean
country.
thank
you,
your
honors.
