justice
david
h.
souter
would...
would
you
agree
that
because
the
word
reasonable
is
in
there,
it's
perfectly
appropriate
for
them
to
consider
the
strength
of
the
property
right
and
consider
the
particularity
of
the
section
7
right
acquired?
you
just
think
they're
giving
it
an
undue
prominence,
and
in
effect
promoting
those
two
inquiries
to
the
level
of
a
test
as
opposed
merely
to
being
factors
to
be
considered,
is
that
true?
justice
souter
yeah,
but
the
word
reasonable
is
in
there,
and
what
are
they
supposed
to
consider
when
they...
when
they...
when
they
inquire
about
reasonableness?
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
saying
is
that...
that
they're
really...
that
you're
reading
the
word
reasonable
out
of
there,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
as
long
as
there
is
any
other
means
of
communication,
any
other
means
of
reaching,
that
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry,
but
you've
got
to
do
something
with
the
word
reasonable.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in
this...
in
this
setting,
mr.
dreeben,
the...
on
the...
the
people
who
are
standing
on
the
grassy
strip
could
have
held
up
a
big
sign
saying
there's
going
to
be
an
organizational
meeting
at
the
legion
hall
on
a
given
night
at
a
given
time.
they
could
have
communicated
that
message
certainly
effectively
as
communication,
and
they
could
then
have
had
just
as
much
opportunity
to
meet
with
people
on
a
person-to-person
basis
as
they
would
have
on
the
streets
of
the
small
town,
except
for
one
thing,
and
that
is
the
people
who
went
to
the
meeting
would
have
to
go
to
it
because
they
wanted
to
go
to
it
and
not
because
they
got
buttonholed
on
the
street.
now,
if
that
is
an
effective
means
of
communication,
then
the
only
distinction
between
the
two
situations
is
that
it
may
be
a
less
effective
means
of
persuasion,
because
it
is
a
less
effective
means
of
getting
less
than
willing
employees
before
you.
isn't
that
the
only
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you're
not
talking,
though,
about
information,
you're
talking
about
effectiveness
in
persuading
them
to
get
to
a
place
where
the
information
can
be
given
if
they
want
to
receive
it,
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
will
talk
with
them
at
a
specific
time
and
place
if
they
are
willing
to
go
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
more
than
just
the
picketing
did.
i...
you
may
feel
they
characterize
the
picketing,
but
that
would
be
a
fair
characterization
of
my
organizational
meeting
hypo.
