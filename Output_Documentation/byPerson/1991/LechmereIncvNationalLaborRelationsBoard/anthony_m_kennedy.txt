justice
kennedy
well,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
communication
is...
is
to...
is
to
persuade--
justice
kennedy
--and
it...
it
seems
to
me
not
a
stretch
at
all
to
say
that
reasonableness
and
an
evaluation
of
reasonableness
includes
an
assessment
of
how
effective
the
communication
is
going
to
be.
if
you
have
a
voice
shouting
in
the
wilderness,
it
just
is...
is
not
what
this
whole...
the
whole
purpose
of
the
organizers.
justice
kennedy
well,
is
the
board's
position
that
the
instruments
of
the
mass
media
are
less
effective
means
of
communication
today
than
they
were
when
babcock
was
decided
in
1956?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
if...
if
we
affirm
the
board
here,
in
effect
there
will
be
a
general
rule
that
absent
some
special
circumstances
union
organizers
always
have
access
to
an
employer's
parking
lot.
justice
kennedy
well,
in
most
cases
it's
going
to
advertising,
telephone,
and
i
don't
see
how
the
run-of-the-mill
case
would
really
be
much
different
than
what
we
have
here.
isn't
that
a
fair
assumption?
justice
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
almost
any
conventional
suburban
shopping
mall
or
shopping
center
context
that
the
general
rule
would
have
to
be
that
there's
access
to
the
parking
lot,
even
if
the
employer
owns
it
and
controls
it.
justice
kennedy
i
just
don't
see
how
to...
i'm
not
saying
that's
an
unreasonable
rule,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
necessary
thrust
of
this
decision.
justice
kennedy
i...
i
agree
that
that's
a
fair
assessment
of
what
the
board
has
done
here.
