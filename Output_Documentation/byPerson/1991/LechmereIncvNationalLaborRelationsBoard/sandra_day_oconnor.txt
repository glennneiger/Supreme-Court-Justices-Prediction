--the...
the
board
found,
i
gather,
that
there
were
no
feasible
and
effective
alternatives
to
going
on

mr.
joy,
in...
in
textile
workers
v.
darlington
company,
a
case
decided
here
after
babcock,
i
don't
find
a
recitation
of
the
structure
that
you
say
babcock
established,
that
you
have
to
determine
initially
whether
there
are
reasonable
alternatives
before
you
can
weigh
the
business
justification
against
the
section
7
rights.
darlington
spoke
of
just
going
right
ahead
and...
and
weighing
the
section
7
rights
against
the
employer's
business
justification.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
board
has
changed
the
test
from
whether
there
are
reasonable
alternatives
to
whether
there
are
reasonable
and
effective
alternatives?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
dreeben,
do
you
think
that
babcock
&
wilson
stands
for
the
proposition
that
it
is
a
two-tier
inquiry,
that
you
first
have
to
determine
whether
there
are
reasonable
alternatives
to
the
trespass
in
order
to
contact
the
employees,
and
only
if
the
answer
to
that
is
no
would
you
go
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
part
of
the
overall
balance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
what
the
board
does.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
doesn't
consider
that
first
or
separately.
