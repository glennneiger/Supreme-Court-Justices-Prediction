justice
clarence
thomas
this
is
a
case
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
petitioner,
lechmere,
owns
and
operate
a
retails
store
located
in
a
shopping
plaza
in
newington,
connecticut.
lechmere
is
also
a
part
owner
of
the
parking
lot.
as
part
of
a
campaign
to
organize
lechmere's
employees,
non-employee
organizers
entered
the
parking
lot
and
placed
handbills
on
the
windshields
of
cars
parked
in
the
employee
section
of
the
lot.
lechmere's
manager
asked
them
to
leave
explaining
that
the
store
had
a
strict
policy
against
handbill
distribution.
they
left
but
came
back
on
several
subsequent
occasions.
each
time,
lechmere
personnel
asked
them
to
leave
and
remove
the
handbills.
the
union
organizers
then
relocated
to
a
strip
of
public
property
adjoining
the
parking
lot.
from
there,
they
passed
out
handbills
and
picketed
lechmere.
the
union
also
contacted
a
substantial
percentage
of
lechmere's
employees
directly
by
tracing
their
license
plate
numbers.
the
union
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
alleging
that
lechmere
had
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
barring
the
organizers
from
its
property.
the
board
ruled
in
the
union's
favor
and
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order
requiring
lechmere
to
allow
the
organizers
onto
its
parking
lot.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
to
enforce
the
board's
order.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
1956
decision
of
this
court,
nlrb
versus
babcock
&
wilcox.
in
that
case,
we
made
it
clear
that
the
nlra
does
not
protect
the
trespasses
of
non-employee
union
organizers
except
in
the
rare
case
where
the
employees
are
inaccessible
and
there
is
no
reasonable
means
short
of
trespass
for
the
union
to
communicate
with
them.
we
have
explained
that
a
union
seeking
to
show
that
employees
are
inaccessible
bears
a
heavy
burden.
here,
the
union
failed
to
carry
that
burden
by
failing
to
establish
the
existence
of
any
obstacles
rendering
lechmere's
employees
inaccessible.
the
board's
order,
therefore,
cannot
be
enforced.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined;
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
