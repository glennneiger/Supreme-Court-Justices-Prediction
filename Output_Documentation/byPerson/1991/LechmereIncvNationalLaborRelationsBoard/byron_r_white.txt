justice
white
and
what
rule
of
law
do
you
say
has
been
violated
by
the
board?
justice
white
i
think
the
court
in
babcock
emphasized
that
condition
of
the
property.
they
emphasize
the
availability
of
alternative
means
of
communicating.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
the
board
would
be
making
a
mistake
under
babcock
if
they
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
media
are
available,
or
whether
the
telephone
is
available,
or
anything
like
that?
justice
white
well,
they...
even,
even
if
going
on
the
property
would
be
more
effective?
justice
white
well,
mr.
dreeben...
mr.
dreeben,
i
take
it
if
the...
let's
assume
the
employer
said,
i
will
distribute
to
every
single
one
of
my
employees
this
notice
of
the
union
meeting
and
the
purpose
of
the
meeting.
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
that
that's
wholly
inadequate.
justice
white
yes
or
no.
justice
white
you
don't?
well,
what
do
you
think
the
board
would...
should
say?
justice
white
well,
the
fact
is,
the
employer
makes
sure
every
single
employee
knows
what...
that
there's
a
meeting
and
that
the
union
wants
to
give
them
some
information
about
how
valuable
it
is
to
belong
to
a
union.
justice
white
i
know,
but
it
just
so
happens
the
employer
is
willing
to
do
that
just
to
avoid
a
lot
of
hassle.
justice
white
so
you
say
that
would
not
be
enough,
the
board
would
be
entitled
to
say
that
that
is
not
a
reasonably
effective
alternative
way
of
communicating.
justice
white
well,
what
would
you
say
if
the
employer
went
a
little
step
farther
and
said
look,
i'm
going
to...
i'm
going
to
distribute
to
every
single
employee
a
notice
of
this
meeting,
and
then
i'm
going
to
add
to
it
a
little
paragraph
that
the
union
will
write
for
me
about
how
great
it
is
to
be
a
member
of
the
union.
he
hands...
that's
all
out,
now.
do
you
think
the...
do
you
think
there
has
to
be
some
reasonable
way
of
the
union
contacting
the
employees
in
person?
justice
white
well,
your
answer
is
yes,
i
guess.
your
answer
is
just
plain
yes.
there
has
to
be
some
reasonably
effective
way
of
actually
communicating
in
person.
justice
white
no,
not
if
the
employees
said,
don't
do
it.
justice
white
well,
i...
under
jean
i
would
think
that
it
may
be
that
alternatives
would
be
reasonable,
considered
reasonable
in
one
case
and
unreasonable
in
another,
depending
on
the
degree
of
intrusion
on
the
property?
justice
white
so
you
are
balancing
the
reasonableness
against
the
degree
of
intrusion.
justice
white
this
is
hardly
the
way
babcock
reads,
is
it?
justice
white
you
would
think
under
babcock
there
was
just
some
concept
of
reasonable
alternative
ways
of
communicating,
which
you
talk
about,
and
it's
a
constant.
justice
white
well,
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
take
it
you
disagree
with
my
characterization
of
babcock
in
this
respect.
justice
white
and
he
excluded
every
other
kind
of
a--
justice
white
--of
a--
justice
white
--do
you
have
any
courts
of
appeals
that
agree
with
you?
justice
white
but
the
answer
is
no.
