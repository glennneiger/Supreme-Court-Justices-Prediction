chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
90-970,
lechmere,
inc.,
v.
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
joy,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
board
explain,
mr.
joy,
why
it
dismissed
the
mass
media
as
a
possible
means
of
communication?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
joy.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
dreeben,
you're
talking
about
an
abstract
proposition,
which
of
course
you
have
to
talk
about
in
a
case
like
this,
but
there
is
a
remarkable
similarity
to
the
layout,
it
seems
to
me,
of
babcock
&
wilcox
and
to
the
layout
of
this
particular
organization,
yet
in
babcock
&
wilcox
this
court
said
the
board
could
not
require
nonemployee
access,
and
in
this
case
the
board
says
yes,
we
can
require
nonemployee
access.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
dreeben,
in
the...
the
board's
order
here
required,
as
i
understand
it,
the
employer
to
allow
access
to
the
parking
lot
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
handbills
and
leaflets
to
the
employees.
is
it
possible
to
tell
from
the
board
proceedings
whether
they
had
in
mind
personal
contact
when
the
material
was
distributed,
or
whether
it
was
thought
it
was
just
going
to
be
left
on
the
windshields
of
cars
or
stuck
in
the
seats?
chief
justice
rehnquist
because
one...
one
would
think
that
if...
if
your
requirement
that
it
be
a
personal
contact
is
uppermost
in
the
board's
mind,
that
putting
it
on
the
windshield
or
sticking
it
in
somebody's
seat
is
not
certainly
most
people's
definition
of
that
sort
of
personal
contact.
chief
justice
rehnquist
or
even
a
personal
contact,
as
you
earlier
spoke
of.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
joy,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
joy.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
90-970,
lechmere
versus
national
labor
relations
board
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
