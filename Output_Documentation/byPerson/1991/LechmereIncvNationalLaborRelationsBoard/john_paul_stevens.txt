may
i
ask
you,
on
the
newspapers,
does
the
record
show
whether
these
were
home-delivered
papers,
or
were
they
suburban
papers
that
are
delivered
in
large
blocks
to
different
places
like
stores?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
were
the
other
two
papers?
are
they
the
same
character,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
know
whether
they're
even...
they're
throw-aways,
or
there
was
a...
you
know,
they
had
to
pay
for
them.
does
the
record
show
that?
in
other
words,
i
notice
there
were
bunches
of
newspapers
at
the
stores,
and
the
store
took
out
the
advertisements
by
the
union
from
the
ones
they
had
at
the
store.
