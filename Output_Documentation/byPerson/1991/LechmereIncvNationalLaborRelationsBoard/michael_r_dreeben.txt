mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
reasonably
accommodated
competing
section
7
rights
and
property
rights.
the
board
found
in
this
case
that
petitioner's
denial
of
access
to
its
parking
lot
for
organizational
handbilling
violated
section
8(a)(1)
of
the
act,
which
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
interfere
with,
restrain,
or
coerce
employees
in
their
section
7
rights.
the
board's
interpretation
of
this
general
language
is
a
reasonable
one,
and
it
should
be
upheld.
the
petitioner's
argument
here
today
makes
clear
that
its
entire
reliance
is
placed
on
the
babcock
&
wilcox
decision
and
inferences
that
petitioner
draws
from
that
decision.
but
the
board's
rule
that's
under
review
today,
however,
is
consistent
with
babcock
&
wilcox.
first,
the
central
principle
of
babcock
&
wilcox
is
that
the
board
must
make
an
accommodation
between
private
property
rights
and
section
7
rights
when
the
two
conflict,
and
that
accommodation
must
be
obtained
with
as
little
destruction
of
one
as
is
consistent
with
the
maintenance
of
the
other.
i
would
suggest
that
that
formulation
itself
implies
that
the
board
should
consider
weighing
the
impact
on
respective
rights
before
reaching
the
appropriate
accommodation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
facts
in
babcock
were
quite
different
than
the
facts
in
this
case,
despite
the
fact
that
both
cases
involve
parking
lots
and
both
cases
involve
organizational
activity.
from
there,
the
cases
fairly
significantly
diverge.
first
of
all,
the
property
in
babcock
was
fenced
property
that
was
surrounding
an
employer's
industrial
plant,
and
it
was
entirely
closed
to
the
public.
there
were
no
means
of
getting
into...
for
any
members
of
the
public.
in
this
case,
in
contrast,
the
property
is
a
parking
lot
that
is
essentially
open
to
the
public
for
anyone
to
come
in
and
park
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
the
babcock
decision
itself
does
not
discuss
the
weight
to
be
accorded
to
the
property
interest
because
of
its
characteristics--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
i
think
that
would
be
a
mistake
for
this
court
to
read
babcock
as
having
decided
every
possible
case
that
could
come
before
the
board
in
the
future
without
regard
to
significant
factual
distinctions.
this
court
in
hudgins
v.
nlrb
recognized
that
there
are
going
to
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
i
think
that
the
board
does
not
have
the
freedom
to
say
what
it
said
in
babcock,
which
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
nonemployees
have
alternative
means.
what
the
board--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
the
board...
the
board
cannot
simply
make
that
judgment.
that's
what
the
court
rejected
in
babcock.
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
what
babcock
actually
decided.
the
board
in
babcock
had
equated
the
right
of
nonemployees
to
enter
for
purposes
of
engaging
in
organizational
communications
with
the
right
of
employees
to
engage
in
that
form
of
communication,
and
this
court
reversed
that
determination,
and
the
central
principle
that
the
court
articulated
was
that
the
balance
is
different
when
you
have
nonemployees.
the
employer
has
a
right
to
maintain
the
privacy
of
the
property
if
there
are
not
reasonably
effective...
if
there
are
reasonably
effective
alternatives
available
to
the
nonemployees.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well...
well,
in
babcock
this
court
never
adverted
to
the
availability
of
mass
media
as
an
alternative
means.
the
court
was...
was
looking
at
a
small-town
setting
in
which
it
spoke
of
meetings
with
employees
on
the
streets
of
the
community,
visits
at
their
home
which
were
easily
arranged,
telephone
calls...
they
were
speaking
of
the
kinds
of
personal
contact
that
i
think
is
not
uncommon
to
be
able
to
arrange
in
a
small-town
setting,
particularly
in
that
era
in
that
part
of
the
country.
the
court
was
not
speaking
of...
of
the
kinds
of
suburban/urban
setting
that
was
present
in
this
case,
where
the
employees
are
widely
dispersed
and
one
newspaper
is
available
that
has
a
circulation
that's
perhaps
10
percent
of
the
entire
population.
it
would
be,
i
think,
extremely
different,
and
this
court
never
confronted
the
problem
of
whether
mass
media
is
effective
in
this
setting.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
that
it
is,
justice
souter,
but
from
the
outset,
the
point
here
is
that
the
section
7
rights
that
are
being
protected
are
the
rights
of
the
employees.
the
court
has
recognized
that
employees
are
not
going
to
be
capable
of...
of
exercising
those
rights
in
a
meaningful
way
unless
they
are
provided
with
the
information
that
enables
them
to
make
a
choice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i...
i
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
board
looks
at
whether
the...
the
information
that
the
employees
receive
is
persuasive
to
them.
a
sign
that's
held
up
that
merely
announces
a
meeting
doesn't
really
provide
the
employees
with
any
information,
doesn't
provide
them
with...
with
much
more
than
the
knowledge
that
a
union
exists
and
would
like
to
talk
with
them.
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
had
in
mind,
even
in
babcock,
that
the
only
thing
the
union
had
to
be
able
to
do
was
announce
its
existence.
there's
a
recognition
that
the
employees
need
to
have
a
more
sustained
opportunity
to
hear
from
the
union
organizers
before
they're
even
going
to
want
to
come.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
with
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it's
not
clear
that
they
don't
want
to
receive
the
information.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
adequate,
because
it
doesn't
allow
them
to
have
any
opportunity,
it
doesn't
allow
them
to
be
confronted
with
the
facts
that
may
influence--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
they
may
ultimately
not
want
to
hear
it,
even
if
the
employees
simply
get
the
opportunity
to
receive
the
information
from
the
union.
they
can
reject
it
at
that
point,
and
there's
no...
the
board
is
not
saying
here
that...
that
nothing
is
effective
short
of
persuading
the
employees
that
they
ought
to
join
a
union,
but
what
the
board
is
saying
is
that
the
employees
should
be
given
the
information
so
that
they
have
the
opportunity
to
make
a
decision.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
this
court
has
recognized
that
it
is
a
literal
interference
with
the
employees'
ability
to
get
information
if
the
employer
prevents
someone
from
handing
them
a
handbill.
i
mean,
babcock
&
wilcox
itself
recognizes
that
there
is
a
violation
of
section
8(a)(1)
by
the
employer's
denial
of
access,
so
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
question
that
the
language
of
the
act
read
literally
applies
to
an
employer's
attempt
to
keep
the
employees
from
getting
the
information.
in
this
case,
the
employer's
representatives
actually
pulled
a
handbill
out
of
the
hands
of
the
employees,
and
i
would
suggest
that
is
a
literal
interference
with
the
right
to
get
information.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that...
that's
the
issue
in
this
case,
whether
they
had
a
right
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--federal
law
does
give
the
employees
the
right
to
organize,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
order
meaningfully
to
exercise
that
right
there's
a
need
for
the
employees
to
be
addressed
by
organizers.
they
are
not
likely
to
have
the
information
on
their--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
board
would
say
about
that
question.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
the
board
should
look
at
the
actual
facts
of
the
situation,
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
act
contemplates
that
the
employer
should
be
the
vehicle
for
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
that
is
not
likely
to
be
a
way
that
the
employees
are
going
to
receive
the
undiluted
message
of
what
the
union
has
to
say.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i...
i'm
not
sure
what
the
board
would
say
about
that.
i
do
not
think
that
if--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
that's
a
very
significant
component
of
what
the
board
is
looking
at.
i
don't
think
it's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
an
organizing
setting,
either
in
person
or
by
the...
over
the
telephone
would
likely
be
a
necessity.
the
employer
would
always
have
the
option
of
giving
the
union
a
list
of
the
employees
and
allowing
the
contact--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
there's...
there's
certainly...
this
is
not...
this
doesn't
raise
the
case
in
which
the
employee
said,
don't
do
it.
there
have
been
cases
in
which
the
employer
has
distributed
a
list
of
the
employees
and
the
board
has
found
that
to
be
a
satisfactory
alternative
under
these
particular
circumstances,
so
there
are
alternative
ways
for
the
employer
to
deal
with
this.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that
is...
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
that
actually
happened
in
this
case.
what
the
employer
did
was
attempt
to
eject
the
union
from
the
public
property
itself
and
called
a
policeman
to
do
that.
the
policeman
then
informed
the
union
that
they
had
a
10-foot
strip
of
public
property
that
they
could
stand
on.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i...
i
think
a
personal
conversation
does
constitute
one.
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
what
your
question
goes
to
essentially
is
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
board's
finding
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that...
that
whether
there
is
or
isn't
adequate
access
is
something
that
depends
on
particular
facts,
and...
and
it
could
well
be
that
in
a
particular
case
the
board
would
find
that
access
from
public
property
to
the
employees
was
certainly
good
enough.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
that's
what
this
court
said
was
enough
access,
even
in
the
babcock
case.
in
the
babcock
case,
the
court
talked
about
the
union
communicating
directly
with
the
employees
through
visual
methods
such
as
telephone
calls,
visits
on
streets,
home
visits,
and
those...
those
were
part...
that
was
part
of
what
the
court
thought
would
constitute
a
reasonable
way
for
the
union
to
be
able
to
get
in
touch
with
the
employees.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
sure.
that...
that
is
certainly
all
that's
required
by
the
act.
the
employees
are
not
required
to
accept
the
message.
as
the
board--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
the...
if
the
union
actually
has
the
opportunity
to
talk
to
the
employees.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
the
board
has
the
right
to
make
the
judgment
that
that's
not
going
to
be
a
reasonably
effective
way
for
the
employees
to
even
understand
what
the
union
wants
to
talk
to
them
about,
and
that
is,
after
all,
what
the
board's
mission
is
in
this
case,
and
when
the
court
spoke
of
the
accommodation
of
interests
in
the
hudgens
case,
it
had
in
mind
that
the
board
would
take
into
account
the
character
of
the
property
and
the
kind
of
section
7
right
and
question
in
deciding
whether
there
was
adequate
protection
of
the
section
7
right
in
question.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
babcock
structures
the
inquiry
so
that
the
board
is
precluded
from
doing
what
it
does
here,
which
is
considering
the
reasonableness
of
alternatives
in
conjunction--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that...
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
what
the
board
does.
the
board
will
not
order
access
if
there
are
reasonable
alternatives
available.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
does
consider
it
separately
in
the
sense
that
if
there
are
reasonable
alternatives
available,
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
but
the
board
does
not
view
that
as
a
factor
in
isolation
from
other
factors,
and
i
would
suggest
that's
exactly
what
this
court
recognized
that
the
board
might
do
in
hudgens
v.
nlrb,
where
it
spoke
of
the
accommodation
as
falling
as...
on
points
along
a
spectrum.
there's
nothing
to
suggest
in
that
case
that
the
court's
language
should
be
read
as...
as
saying
that
the
board
can
only
look
at
the
section
7
right
and
property
right
after
it
looks
at
alternative
means,
and
babcock
should
not
be
read
so
as
to
restrict
the
board's
latitude
in
interpreting
the
act
in
that
fashion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
the...
the
purpose
of
that
inquiry
is
to
fulfill
what
the
board
spoke
of
in
babcock.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
the
board
is
balancing
is
how
much
section
7
rights
will
suffer
against
how
much
property
rights
will
suffer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
there's...
there's
aspects
of
both.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
what
the
board
is
doing
is
deciding
whether
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
with
respect
to
the
employer's
conduct
in
this
case.
what
the
union
did
in
this
case
was
attempt
to
place
handbills
on
the
windshields
of
cars.
they
handed
them
to
the
employees
who
they
saw.
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practice
was
in
barring
the
union
from
doing
that.
the
board
is
not
insisting
that
there
be
a
particular
kind
of
contact
or
interaction
between
employees--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
not
insisting
that
that
be
the
case
at
all.
what
it
is
requiring
is
that
the
union
be
permitted
to
do
that
which
the
act
entitles
it
to
do,
measured
against
the
union's
actual
conduct
in...
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
that...
that
the
rule,
justice
kennedy,
would
be
absent
special
circumstances.
the
question
would
be,
are
there
reasonable
alternatives
to
access
under
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no
it
isn't,
because
many
kinds
of
facilities
will
have
public
property
where
the
employees
enter,
and
there
will
be
an
opportunity
for
the
union
to
make
contact
with
the
employees
before
they
get
on
the
employer's
property.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
the
thrust
of
this
decision
is
that
the
board
is
entitled
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
a
parking
lot
is
essentially
open
to
the
public
and
that
the
infringement
on
the
employer's
property
interest
in
allowing
a
small
amount
of
peaceful,
quiet
organizational
activity
is
not
a
substantial
infringement.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and...
and
what
the
board--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
justice
scalia,
i
don't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
what
the
court
was
doing
in
sears
was
attempting
to
foreordain
how
the
board
might
apply
the
act
in
future
cases.
what
the
court
was
doing
in
sears
was
summarizing
certain
language
from
babcock
and
stating
what
it
had
understood
the
board's
practice
to
be,
and
that's
what
the
court
meant
when
it
said
the
balance
has
rarely
been
struck
in
favor
of
access.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
in
his
concurrence
in
that
case,
i
believe,
that
the
board's
experience
had
been
comparatively
limited
in
applying
babcock,
because
for
several
years
there
had
been
first
amendment
holdings
of
this
court
that
recognized
shopping
centers
as
essentially
forums
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
the
board
had
not
gained
as
much
experience
in
developing
and
applying
the
law,
so
what
the
court
did
in
sears
was
look
to
the
existing
state
of
the
law
and
summarize
it.
i
don't
believe
that
it
purported
to
change
it.
i
certainly
don't
believe
that
it
purported
to
overrule
the
statement
in
hudgens,
which
was
an
access
case,
where
the
court
said
that
there
are
a
spectrum
of
various
accommodations
that
depend
upon
the
character
and
strength
of
the
property
interest
and
the
section
7
interest
in
any
given
case.
that
is
what
the
board
is
attempting
to
implement
in
this
case.
what
the
board
is
doing
is
not
inconsistent
with
babcock,
because
the
board
does
look
to
reasonable
alternatives
in
every
case.
whether
or
not
every
decision
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence
is
not
a
question
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
board's
general
approach,
and
the
board's
approach
is
fully
consistent
with
the
statutory
language.
i
think
on
that
basis
it
is
entitled
to
be
upheld.
the...
the
question
of
mass
media
was
raised
by
petitioner
as
being
a
panacea,
as
a
form
of
access
in
all
cases.
i
think
the
board's
answer
to
that
is
a
quite
reasonable
one.
if
you're
attempting
to
reach
200
employees
who
live
in
a
fairly
large
metropolitan
area,
the
expense
and
the
unlikeliness
that
the
newspapers
will
actually
convey
the
organizational
message
is
a
powerful
reason
for
rejecting
mass
media
as
an
alternative
in
every
case.
similarly,
in
this
case
the
board
looked
at...
at
what
the
union
had
available
for
contacts
with
the
employees
at
their
homes
through
tracing
license
plates
and
concluded
that
that
was
not
effective
either.
the
reason
is
that
the
union
attempted
to
trace
license
plates
over
several
months,
and
it
obtained
less
than
a
fifth
of
the
names
of
petitioner's
employees.
that
is
not
going
to
get
the
message
about
the
union's
existence
and
the
programs
that
it
supports
to
four-fifths
of
the
work
force,
and
i
think
the
board
was
fully
entitled
to
reject
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
record
doesn't
show
that.
i
think
that
the
hartford
courant
is
a
general
circulation
daily
newspaper,
so
that
it
would
be
delivered
to
homes
and
subscribers.
of
course,
some
of
the
newspapers
actually--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
know,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
record
shows
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
that's
precisely
my
point,
justice
stevens.
the...
to
the
extent
that
we
knew
that
there
were
newspapers
that
the
employees
might
be
exposed
to,
the
employer
did
everything
it
could
to
prevent
the
employees
from
seeing
it,
so
this
is
a
far
cry
from
any
case
where
the
employer
was
cooperating
in
communicating
information
to
the
employees
for
that
purpose.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
essence,
justice
scalia,
that
is
correct.
the
board
does
balance
the
impairment
of
the
interests
at
stake,
so
the
question
is,
how
much
have
the
section
7
rights
suffered
in
a
particular
case
by
the
denial
of
access
versus
how
much
have
the
property
rights
been
injured
in
a
particular
case
by
access,
and
so
it
does
matter
what
kind
of
property
is
at
issue.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that
babcock
can
be
read
as
answering
all
of
the
questions
that
the
board--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
i
do.
i
think
that
babcock
was
a
specific
application
of...
of
the
labor
act
to
a
particular
set
of
facts,
and
it
cannot
and
should
not
be
read
as
foreordaining
what
the
board
has
to
do
in
future
cases.
it's
a
widely
shared
consensus
in
the
law
that
open
property
is
of
a
different
character
than
closed
property.
this
court's
fourth
amendment
cases
treat
the
home
and
its
curtilage
far
differently
than
open
fields
are
treated.
california
affords
a
right
of
access
to
shopping
centers
as
essentially
public
places
where
it's
appropriate
to
engage
in
expressive
activity,
and
this
court
upheld
that
against
constitutional
challenges.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
