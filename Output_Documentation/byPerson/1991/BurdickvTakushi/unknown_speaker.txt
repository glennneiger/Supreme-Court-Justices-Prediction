unknown
speaker
mr.
eisenberg,
are
you
asserting
the
right
just
to
make
a
write-in
vote
for
someone
who
would
otherwise
be
qualified
to
be
on
the
ballot?
unknown
speaker
for
someone,
who
under
state
law
could
not
qualify
to
occupy
the
office?
unknown
speaker
donald
duck.
mickey
mouse,
donald
duck,
whatever,
that
is
fine.
you
are
claiming
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
anyone
can
write
something
on
the
ballot.
now
you
are
going
further
than
that,
you
want
the
state
to
have
to
count
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
quite
literally
to
set
up
a
column
in
the
returns
that
it
gives
to
the
reporters
and
certifies,
to
set
up
a
column
as
protest
vote?
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
constitution
requires
every
state
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
just
a
minute,
i
am
trying
to
ask
you
a
question.
unknown
speaker
what
provision
of
the
constitution
do
you
think
it
is
that
requires
that?
unknown
speaker
have
we
ever
held
that
the
first
amendment
establishes
a
right
to
vote?
unknown
speaker
have
we?
unknown
speaker
i
wasn't
asking
you
about
the...
i
didn't
ask
you
about
the
equal
protection,
i
asked
you
about
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
is
the
theory
behind
your
answer
a
theory
of
effective
franchise
or
solely
a
theory
of
first
amendment
expression,
in
effect,
quite
independent
of
the
act
of
voting?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
the
extent
that
your
argument
is
based
on
a
meaningful
ballot
kind
of
argument,
why
should
the
standards
be
any
different
from...
or
perhaps
you
are
not
saying
they
should
be,
but
should
the
standards
be
any
different
from
the
ballot
access
cases?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
under
the
ballot
access
cases,
we
will
assume
it
is
some
real
individual,
not
donald
duck,
decided
at
the
same
time
your
client
did
that
he
would
like
to
be
on
the
ballot
and
came
forward
under,
given
the
statutory
scheme
of
hawaii,
that
he
would
have
any
claim
on
the
ballot
access
theory?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
ultimate
value
to
be
served
by
ballot
access
is
effective
franchise.
i
mean,
it
is
ultimately
a
public
interest
and
not
merely
the
interest
of
the
individual
who
wants
to
be
on
the
ballot,
and
bearing
that
in
mind,
number
1,
shouldn't
the
standards
be
the
same
whether
we
are
dealing
with
a
person
who
wants
to
be
on
the
ballot
or
the
person
who
wants
to
write
in
a
name.
wouldn't
you
agree
that
they
should
be
essentially
the
same
standards?
unknown
speaker
now
if
they
are
the
same
standards,
isn't
it
clear
that
under
the
hawaii
statute,
the
access
to
the
ballot
is
sufficiently
free
so
that
the
individual
who
woke
up
after
the
primary
period
and
said,
gee,
nobody
is
running,
i
want
my
name
on
there,
that
individual
wouldn't
have
any
claim
under
the...
given
the
hawaii
statute.
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
basically
want
us
to
expand
the
law,
not
merely
with
respect
to
somebody
who
wishes
to
write
in,
but
you
want
us
to
expand
ballot
access
law
beyond
any
point
that
it
has
reached
thus
far.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
i
mean,
you
do
basically
want
an
expansion
of
ballot
access
from
anything
that
our
cases
have
held
up
to
this
point,
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
accepting
that.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
each
of
those
interests,
do
we
apply
strict
scrutiny,
rational-basis
scrutiny
or
some
other
form
of
scrutiny
to
assessing
the
validity
of
hawaii's
interest?
unknown
speaker
is
that
under
the
first
amendment
prong
of
your
argument
or
under
the
right-to-vote
prong?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
likely
that
a
write-in
voter
is
probably
better
informed
than
other
voters?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question,
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
do
you
think
that
hawaii
could
prohibit
anyone
from
qualifying
for
and
holding
office
unless
they
have
followed
hawaii's
procedure
for
getting
on
the
election
ballot?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
were
a...
not
a
voter
standing
here
today,
but
someone
who
would
like
to
be
a
candidate
and
hold
office,
you
would
take
the
position
that
hawaii's
present
laws
concerning
who
goes
on
the
general
election
ballot
and
therefore
who
can
serve
in
those
offices
on
the
ballot,
you
would
take
the
position
that
that
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
and
how
many
states
have
similar
prohibitions
against
all
write-in?
is
that
a
total
of
five
states?
unknown
speaker
is
it
part
of
your
case
that
the
state
has
to
count
these
votes
or
does
the
state
just
have
to
allow
them
to
be
cast?
unknown
speaker
why
does
it
have
to
provide
this
forum
for
the
dissenters
in
its
election
machine?
what
if
the
state
says,
gee,
it's
just
a
lot
cheaper
to
buy
time
for
them
on
some
television
channel,
so
election
eve,
everybody
who
wants
to
vote
no
will
be
given
time
to
come
in
and
protest?
unknown
speaker
voting
is
about
getting
somebody
elected.
it's
about
choosing
someone
to
govern
you.
it's
not
about
protesting
it.
unknown
speaker
how
did
we
recognize
that
in
anderson?
unknown
speaker
well,
sure,
but
the
importance
there
is
that
by
discussing
different
issues,
you
may
elect
a
different
person.
there
is
nothing
in
that
opinion
that
suggests
anything
about
the
ability
of
the
people
to
protest,
to
use
the
election
as
a
protest
mechanism,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
eisenberg,
if
the
essence
of
your
claim
is
the
right
to
be
heard
in
saying
no,
why
isn't
the
statement
of
no
sufficiently
recorded
simply
if
the
state
records
a
blank
ballot?
by
doing
that,
they
are
saying,
he
has
said
no
to
the
candidate
on
the
ballot.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
the
voter
may
get
the
name
wrong
when
the
voter
writes
the
name
in.
i
mean,
no
method
of
expression
is
absolutely
foolproof,
but
by
and
large
everybody
understands
that
most
people
don't
cast
blank
ballots
unless
they
do
so
for
the
sake
of
saying,
i
don't
want
to
elect
any
of
these
people.
and
isn't
that
expression
recorded
when
either
a
blank
ballot
is
recorded
as
such
or
the
state
simply
says
there
were
x
ballots
cast
and
the
total
of
votes
for
the
candidate
is
something
less
than
that?
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
there
were
5
states
that
currently
don't
allow
write-ins.
what
is
the
historical
practice?
is
it
a
relatively
new
phenomenon,
not
to
allow
write-ins?
unknown
speaker
and
before
the
australian
ballot,
you
could
always,
of
course,
cast
a
vote
for
whomever
you
wanted.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
eisenberg.
mr.
michaels,
we
will
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
why
would
that
be--
--i
don't
understand
that,
explain
that
to
me.
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
at
all.
you
agree,
i
think
you
stated
expressly
in
your
answer
that
you
understand
that
they
are
not
claiming
that
the
person
for
whom
the
write-in
vote
is
cast
must
by
the
same
reasoning
be
seated
in
office
if
there
is
a
sufficient
number,
or
would
otherwise
be
a
sufficient
number
of
write-in
votes
to
elect
the
person.
you
understand
them
explaining
that?
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
that
concession
is
made,
how
does
their
argument
threaten
the
term
limit?
in
other
words,
the
former
governor
isn't
going
to
have
to
go
back
to
the
state
house
on
their
theory,
it
is
just
that
everybody
is
going
to
know
that
a
lot
of
people
wish
he
could.
unknown
speaker
maybe
your
argument
was
just
hyperbole.
unknown
speaker
i
wasn't
worried
about
the
multiterm
congressman,
i
was
worried
about
donald
duck.
that
is
really
scary.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
could
you
explain
something
to
me,
general
michaels,
just,
your
primaries
are
september?
unknown
speaker
and
your
general
election
is
in
november,
right?
unknown
speaker
what
safety
valve
is
there
for
the
unlikely
contingency
that
on
october
1st
the
two
principal
candidates
are
either
killed
in
an
airplane
accident
or
suddenly
revealed
to
be
armed
robbers
or
some
very
dramatic
thing
that
would
convince
90
percent
of
the
people
in
hawaii
they
didn't
want
to
vote
for
him.
what
can
be
done?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
change
the
question
a
little
bit.
assume
they
don't
withdraw.
the
two
candidates
that
survived,
or
just
some
very
dramatic
incident
that
makes
them
extraordinarily
unpopular
with
the
electorate,
they
are
revealed
to
have
been
involved
in
something
very
unusual,
is
there
any
safety
valve?
i
mean,
you
don't
have
a
write-in,
so
is
there
any
safety
valve
by
which
some
other
candidate
could
appeal
to
the
electorate?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
startling
disclosure
might
just
as
well
occur
the
day
after
the
election
as
a
week
before
the
election
and
you
are
still
in
the
same
situation.
that
is
a
problem
that
i
guess
can't
be
avoided.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
a
problem
that
every
state
that
has
write-in
ballots
has
a
solution
for
it
up
to
the
election
date.
unknown
speaker
are
those
filing
deadlines,
means
you
can't
write-in
for
the
candidate
unless
he
meets
that
deadline?
unknown
speaker
mr.
michaels,
let
me
ask
you
about
something
you
covered,
i
believe
a
moment
ago,
and
that
is
the
interest
against
party
raiding
and
the
necessary
time
for
the
party
to
go
to
court.
i
don't
think
i
quite
followed
that.
could
you
expand
on
it
a
little
bit?
unknown
speaker
you
could
accomplish
that,
of
course,
by
just
providing
that
only
registered
voters
could
vote
in
the
primary
of
the
party,
couldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes,
only
registered
republicans
vote
in
the
republican
and
only
democrats--
unknown
speaker
--so
a
registered
democrat
could
not
run
in
the
republican
primary
in
hawaii?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
michaels.
mr.
eisenberg,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
i
am
troubled
that
the
case
might
turn
on
that.
do
you
think
the
case
might...
if
we
disagree
with
that
proposition,
do
you
lose
the
case?
unknown
speaker
that
a
no
vote
is
qualitatively
much
different
than
a
blank
ballot?
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
argument
all
the
states
with
a
long
filing
deadline
for
write-in
candidates
would
also
be
violating
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
you
say
even
those
are
invalid.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do.
you
say
that
even
those
votes
for
candidates
who
haven't
met
the
filing
deadlines
have
to
be
counted.
unknown
speaker
these
states
that
have
1
or
2-week
filing
deadlines,
do
they
now
count
those
votes
no
for
people
who
haven't--
unknown
speaker
--you
didn't
disagree
with
that?
