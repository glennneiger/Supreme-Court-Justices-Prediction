mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
hawaii's
total
prohibition
against
write-in
voting.
this
case
began
in
1986.
in
the
general
election
that
year
held
in
hawaii
with
respect
to
state
legislative
offices,
one-third
of
those
elections
were
uncontested;
a
single
candidate
was
running
unopposed.
and
that
pattern
of
uncontested
elections
was
consistent
with
the
pattern
that
prevailed
in
the
1982
elections
and
in
the
1984
general
elections
with
respect
to
state
legislative
offices.
one
of
the
uncontested
elections
in
1986
occurred
in
the
state
legislative
district,
the
state
house
of
representatives
district
in
which
mr.
burdick
lived.
a
single
candidate
was
running
unopposed.
mr.
burdick
had
no
interest
in
voting
for
that
candidate.
he
did,
however,
want
to
participate
in
the
election,
and
he
saw
his
only
opportunity
to
participate
as
the
casting
of
a
write-in
ballot
to
express
his
opposition
to
the
single
candidate
running
unopposed,
and
to
express
support
for
an
alternative
candidate.
hawaii,
unfortunately,
has
a
total
prohibition
against
all
write-in
voting
in
all
elections
and
under
all
circumstances,
and
that
total
prohibition
was
invoked
to
bar
his
right
to
exercise
a
write-in
ballot.
this
total
prohibition,
therefore,
denied
mr.
burdick
the
opportunity
to
vote
for
the
candidate
of
his
choice,
or
in
the
alternative,
to
cast
a
ballot
as
a
protest
vote.
moreover,
one
of
the
unique
functions
of
write-in
voting
in
our
society
is
that
it
serves
as
a
safety
valve
mechanism,
to
permit
voters
to
respond
to
new
issues
or
changed
circumstances
that
arise
after
the
close
of
the
petitioning
period
but
before
the
election.
in
this
case,
mr.
burdick
did
not
realize
that
a
single
candidate
was
running
unopposed
until
the
close
of
the
petitioning
period
and
still
hawaii
invoked
its
total
prohibition
against
write-in
voting,
even
to
deny
the
use
of
the
write-in
ballot
as
a
safety
valve
mechanism.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
we
think
that
mr.
burdick
has
a
right
to
vote
for
somebody
who
is
unqualified
as
well
as
for
somebody
who
is
qualified.
we
think
that
if
mr.
burdick--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--that's
right.
in
that
instance,
the
vote
would
simply
be
a
protest
vote,
a
vote
no.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
we
are
claiming
that
the
individual
has
a
right
to
vote
for
mickey
mouse
or
donald
duck.
how
the
state
chooses
to
record
that
vote
is--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--well,
there
are
several
things
that
are
implicated
in
the
phrase,
count
it.
we
don't
insist
that
mr.
burdick
has
the
right
to
have
somebody
who
is
ineligible
to
hold
office,
hold
office.
so
his
vote
isn't
counted
towards
the
election
of
that
person.
but
we
do
think
that
the
right
to
vote
embraces
both
a
right
to
choose,
and
if
there
is
no
meaningful
choice,
a
right
to
say
no,
and
if
mr.
burdick
chooses
to
say
no
by
voting
for
an
unqualified
candidate
or
a
fictional
character,
mr.
burdick
can
do
so.
the
state
should
record
his
vote,
we
think,
as
a
protest
vote.
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
record
that
vote
as
a
protest
vote.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
well,
there
are
several
approaches.
the
state
of
virginia
simply
records
every
vote
as
it
is
written
in,
so
that
if
somebody
votes
for
a
fictional
character,
if
somebody
votes
for
an
unqualified
candidate--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--we
think
that
the
constitution,
at
the
very
least,
requires
that
the
state
acknowledge
the
protest
vote,
the
vote
no.
we
think
if
elections
are
about
voting
either
in
support
or
against
candidates,
then
the
vote
against
a
candidate
must
be
recorded
somehow.
it
needn't
have
a
full
list--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--i
am
sorry.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
we
think
that
the
textual
source
of
our
constitutional
claim
is
either
the
first
amendment
or
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
well,
we
have--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--we
have
used
the
equal
protection
clause
to
find
that
there
was
a
right
to
a
meaningful
vote.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
well,
i
think
we
have
talked
about
the
first
amendment
right
of
political
participation
in
a
number
of
cases,
and
in
anderson
against
celebrezze,
the
court
identified
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
run
for
office,
the
right
to
associate
in
support
of
a
candidate,
all
as
an
amalgam
of
rights
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
i
think,
your
honor,
it
is
both.
it
involves
the
right
to
cast
a
meaningful
ballot,
which
is
in
some
sense,
the
right
of
effective
franchise.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
we
think
that
the
overarching
standard
employed
by
this
court
even
in
ballot
access
cases
generally
is
anderson
against
celebrezze
which--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--well,
we
think
that
he
may
or
may
not
have
a
claim
under
a
ballot
access
theory,
but
that
is
because
there
are
very
different
interests
that
apply
when
the
state
is
regulating
access
to
the
ballot
in
a
formal
printed
way.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
we
do
agree
that
the
standards
are
the
same,
and
the
standard
is
anderson
against
celebrezze.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
well,
we
think
that
that
individual
should
have
a
claim,
because
we
think
that
write-in
voting
provides
an
important
safety
valve
mechanism
which
should
be
recognized--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--well,
ballot
access
law
as
we
have
generally
understood
it
involves
regulating
the
formal
printed
ballot.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
if
ballot
access
is
to
be
defined
more
broadly,
as
your
honor
is
suggesting,
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
that
would
be
correct,
but
we
think
that
the
overarching
standard
is
the
anderson
against
celebrezze
standard,
which
requires
in
this
instance
the
state
of
hawaii
to
come
forward
with
some
showing
that
the
total
prohibition
that
it
imposes
is
necessary
to
the
advancement
of
some
substantial
governmental
interest,
and
that
is
a
showing
that
the
state
of
hawaii
cannot
make
in
this
case.
that
is
a
showing
that
the
state
of
hawaii
has
not
made
in
this
case.
hawaii
advances
four
interests
in
support
of
its
claim.
first,
an
interest
in
limiting
factionalism
by
prohibiting
sore-loser
candidacies;
second,
an
interest
in
protecting
political
parties
against
interparty
raiding;
third,
an
interest
in
an
informed
electorate;
fourth,
an
interest
in
protecting
hawaii's
runaway
election
provisions.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
we
think
we
apply
anderson
against
celebrezze
with
teeth,
which
approaches
strict
scrutiny,
which
is
the
standard
imposed
in
tashjian
and
in
eu.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
the
court
has
in
anderson
and
most
recently
in
norman
against
reed
suggested
that
while
it
looks
first
these
days
to
the
first
amendment
as
the
source,
as
the
textual
source
for
the
protection
of
the
rights
of
electoral
participation,
it
would
reach
the
same
result
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
it
doesn't
much
matter
whether
you
call
it
a
right
to
vote
or
an
equal
right
to
vote.
in
both
instances,
we
think
that
hawaii
is
obligated
to
show
that
the
total
prohibition
is
necessary
to
the
advancement
of
substantial
governmental
interests,
and
it
has
not
made
that
showing
in
this
case.
the
interest
in
an
informed
electorate,
while
a
worthwhile
goal,
cannot
justify
hawaii's
blanket
prohibition,
even
in
circumstances
where
there
are
no
sore-loser
candidates.
if
the
state
is
concerned
about
sore-loser
candidates
it
can
enact
a
narrow
sore-loser
provision.
the
interest
in
protecting
parties
against
interparty
raiding
has
no
application
whatever
to
a
prohibition
that
would
be
extended
to
a
general
election.
interparty
raiding
is
a
concern
about
voting
in
primary
elections.
so
again,
hawaii's
total
prohibition
sweeps
too
broadly.
we
think
that
there
is
another
consideration
in
this
regard,
and
that
is
that
at
least
one
of
the
three
established
parties
in
hawaii,
the
libertarian
party,
has
now
expressly
requested
that
voters
in
its
primary
elections
be
permitted
to
cast
write-in
ballots.
so
hawaii,
it
seems
to
us,
now
has
a
tashjian
problem,
a
problem
confronted
by
this
court
in
tashjian
where
the
state,
in
that
instance,
the
state
of
connecticut,
was
imposing
a
restrictive
measure
on
ballot
access,
and
even
in
circumstances
where
the
party
had
no
interest
in
the
protection
that
the
state
was
affording
it.
and
so
for
these
reasons
we
think
that
the
interest
in
protecting
against
interparty
raiding
is
insufficient
in
this
case.
the
interest
in
an
informed
electorate,
again,
while
a
worthwhile
goal,
we
think
cannot
be
justified
here.
if
the
state
is
concerned
about
voters
voting
in
an
ignorant
way,
that
concern
seems
improbable,
because
it
is
not
likely
that
somebody
is
going
to
vote
for
somebody
that
they
know
nothing
about,
when
you
have
to
actually
go
to
the
trouble
of
casting
a
write-in
ballot.
if
the
concern
is
for
the--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--it
is
likely
that
a
write-in
voter
who
goes
to
the
trouble
of
casting
a
write-in
vote
is
better
informed
than
other
voters.
moreover,
if
the
state
were
concerned
about
the
body
politic
in
general,
that
is
to
say,
if
the
state
were
concerned
that
everybody
ought
to
know
that
are
surreptitious
write-in
candidates
afoot,
then
the
state
can
do,
the
state
of
hawaii
can
do
what
approximately
20
other
states
do:
it
can
require
that
write-in
candidates
file
a
declaration
of
candidacy
shortly
before
the
election.
this
mechanism
satisfies
the
safety
valve
concern.
it
allows
write-in
candidates
to
enter
the
race
after
the
petitioning
process
is
closed
where
new
circumstances
or
new
issues
arise,
and
it
provides
that
flexibility.
and
if
the
state
were
concerned
about
an
informed
electorate
in
that
regard,
informing
the
electorate
that
there
are
other
write-in
candidates
or
indeed
there
are
other
candidates
beyond
those
who
are
simply
listed
on
the
ballot,
hawaii
can
do,
as
i
say,
what
20
other
states
have
done.
finally,
the
interest
in
protecting
hawaii's
runaway
election
provisions
cannot
justify
hawaii's
policy.
to
the
degree
that
hawaii
has
abolished
general
elections
in
these
circumstances,
there
is
no
occasion
to
cast
a
write-in
ballot,
so
this
last
concern
about
hawaii,
this
concern
about
their
provisions
with
respect
to
runaway
elections,
is
irrelevant.
in
fact,
hawaii's
runaway
election
provisions,
provisions
which
permit
a
candidate
who
emerges
from
the
primary
election
as
a
victor
and
unopposed
for
at
least
county
offices
and
state
legislative
offices,
not
to
have
to
stand
for
election
in
the
general
election,
that
provision
argues
more
forcefully
in
favor
of
a
right
to
cast
a
write-in
ballot
in
these
dispositive
primary
elections,
because
in
hawaii,
given
the
pattern
of
uncontested
elections,
and
given
these
runaway
election
provisions,
the
right
to
cast
a
write-in
ballot
at
the
primary
level
is
very,
very
important.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
should
like
to
reserve--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--if
hawaii
had
a
write-in
candidate
registration
requirement,
a
requirement
that
a
write-in
candidate
declare
and
if
the
candidate
fails
to
comply,
it
seems
to
us
that
hawaii
can
do
what
these
20
other
states
do,
which
is
to
declare
the
individual
ineligible
to
hold
office.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
we
think
to
the
degree
that
hawaii
does
not
provide
for
the
safety
valve
mechanism
of
a
write-in
ballot,
to
permit
the
candidate,
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
to
enter
the
race
as
a
write-in
candidate
after
the
petitioning
period
is
closed,
which
in
hawaii
is
60
days
before
the
primary
election,
105
days
before
the
general
election,
we
think
that
hawaii's
provisions
are
too
restrictive.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
there
is
a
total
of...
there
are
four
states
that
by
statute
prohibit
write-ins
and
we
are
informed
that
louisiana,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
also
prohibits
write-in
voting.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
we
think
that
the
state
has
to
count
the
votes,
clearly
a
vote
for
a
qualified
candidate
should
surely
be
counted.
but
we
also
think
that
the
state
should
have
to
count
the
protest
vote,
the
vote
no.
the
state
may
be
able
to
put
it
into
a
broad
category
of
no
votes,
but
the
state
has
to
recognize
that
there
is
a
body
of
dissenters
out
there
who
don't
like
the
choices
that
have
been
provided
to
them.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
because
voting
is
about
voting
for
or
against
the
candidates
who
are
holding
themselves
up--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--we
think,
your
honor,
that
it
is
about
both.
and
in
fact,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
electoral
process
extends
beyond
simply
choosing
somebody
who
is
going
to
get
elected.
in
anderson
against
celebrezze,
this
court
recognized
the
important
expressive
aspects
of
the
electoral
process,
engendering
new
issues
into
the
process,
in
putting
forth
new
ideas.
and
so
this
court
has
granted
first
amendment
recognition
to--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--well,
because...
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
of
the
role
of
third
parties
and
what
the
court
called
third-force
candidacies
in
talking
about
the
importance
of
john
anderson's
campaign
in
1980.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
not
specifically,
your
honor.
but
the
very
definition
of
an
election,
in
our
view,
embraces
the
right
to
choose
and
again,
if
there
is
no
meaningful
choice,
the
right
to
say
no,
and
that
right
to
say
no
has
to
be
reflected
somewhere
on
the
books
of
the
state.
it
is
a
very
dangerous
notion,
both
in
first
amendment
terms
and
in
terms
of
higher
democratic
values,
for
the
state
to
try
to
sweep
that
dissent
under
the
rug,
to
pretend
it
doesn't
exist.
when
hawaii
says
to
mr.
burdick,
in
the
interest
of
promoting
consensus,
you
can
vote
for
only
one
candidate
or
not
vote
at
all,
consensus
may
be
a
very
valuable
interest,
but
consensus
depends
upon
consent,
and
the
state
has
an
obligation
as
well
to
recognize
the
dissenting
members
of
its
society
in
the
important
aspect
of
voting.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
because
a
blank
ballot
signifies
more
than
a
vote
no.
a
person
can
simply
fail
to
vote
because
they
overlooked
that
particular
election
on
the
ballot.
the
voter
may
have
simply--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--we
think
that...
hawaii
does
count
blank
ballots,
your
honor,
but
we
think
that
a
blank
ballot
is
not
sufficiently
understood
as
a
dissent
because
there
may
be
a
variety
of
reasons
why
an
individual
may
leave
the
place
blank.
the
person
may
have
forgotten.
the
person
may
have
reached
no
conclusion,
but
an
expression
of
dissent
is
clear
and
it
ought
to
be
recognized.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
no,
actually,
at
least
one
of
the
states
that
prohibits
write-ins
has
prohibited
it
from
the
inception
of
the
australian
ballot.
most
states,
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
responded
to
the
australian
ballot
reform,
to
the
state-prepared
ballot,
by
recognizing
that
there
had
to
be
some
sort
of
safety
valve
mechanism,
both
for
the
reasons
i
have
suggested
and
to
give
flexibility
to
the
electoral
process,
to
give
the
voter
an
opportunity
to
choose,
but
some--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--that's
correct.
that
is
our
understanding
of
the
history.
and
with
the
advent
of
the
australian
ballot,
the
question
of
how
voter
choice
would
ultimately
be
recognized,
and
most
states
recognized
that
write-in
votes
preserve
voter
choice.
but
a
few
states
did
not
even
at
the
outset.
and
in
oklahoma,
for
example,
the
interpretation
by
case
law
was
that
a
write-in
was
a
defacement
of
the
ballot
and
therefore
voided
the
ballot.
and
in
south
dakota,
i
don't
quite,
your
honor,
remember
the
basic
reason,
but
it
was
a
turn-of-the-century
decision
of
the
highest
court
in
that
state.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
still
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
expressed
concern
about
donald
duck,
the
state
may
have
some
dignitary
interest
in
not
recording
in
its
books
the
vote
for
donald
duck,
but
it
is
our
position
that
that
vote
should,
at
the
very
least
be
recorded
as
a
vote
no.
and
a
vote
no
is
not
the
same
as
a
blank
vote
because
the
blank
vote
does
not
necessarily
signify
that
the
person
is
voting
against
the
specific
candidate,
in
this
instance,
who
is
running
on
the
ballot.
in
talking
about--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--the
proposition
that--
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
--we
think
hawaii's
deficiencies
are
twofold,
your
honor.
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
we
don't
lose
the
case
because
hawaii's
law
is
deficient
in
a
second
way.
hawaii
essentially
closes
off,
as
we
said,
the
political
process
to
write-in
vote,
and
even
for
qualified
votes,
so
that
if
somebody
wants
to
vote
for...
not
express
a
no
vote,
a
protest
vote,
but
vote
by
virtue
of
a
write-in
for
somebody
who
is
perfectly
qualified
to
hold
office,
we
think
hawaii's
law
which
closes
off
the
process
60
days
before
the
primary
election
and
105
days
before
the
general
election
is
deficient
on
that
ground
as
well.
the
total
prohibition
simply
cannot
be
sustained.
on
that
issue,
there
was
some
discussion
with
mr.
michaels
about
filing
deadlines
with
respect
to
those
states
that
require
a
write-in
candidate
to
register
shortly
before
the
election,
and
mr.
michaels
shows
several
states
which
have
quite
long
filing
deadlines.
there
are
other
states
that
we
could
have
chosen
that
have
quite
short
filing
deadlines;
california
requires
filing
by
write-ins
2
weeks
in
advance
of
the
election.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
we
think
that
those
states
are
subject
to
the
anderson
against
celebrezze
requirement,
but
the
fact
is
that
most
states
have
filing
deadlines
a
week
or
two
shortly
before
the
election.
in
arizona
it
is
the
wednesday
before.
in
illinois
it
is
the
friday
before
the
election.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
no,
no,
we
do
not
say
that
those
are
invalid.
we
think
that
those
restrictions
shortly
before
an
election,
the
filing
deadline
is
reasonable,
and
the
state
can
say
if
the
write-in
candidate
does
not
file,
that
write-in
candidate
is
not
eligible
to
hold
office.
if
the
deadline
is
not
unreasonably
long,
we
say
that
those
filing
deadlines
are
perfectly
reasonable.
the
only
then
remaining
question
is,
what
does
the
state
do
with
a
vote
for
somebody
who
has
not
registered?
what
does
the
state
then
do
with
the
vote
for
an
unqualified
voter?
in
that
circumstance,
the
vote
in
our
view
is
a
protest
vote,
is
a
vote
no,
and
in
that
circumstance,
the
state
must
still
record
the
vote
as
a
vote
no,
but
we
have
no
problem
with
filing
deadlines
for
write-in
candidates
that
are
reasonably
imposed.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
have
to
be
counted
as
a
no
vote;
that
is
different,
we
think,
than
a
vote
for
a
qualified
candidate.
our
view
is
that
if
an
individual
votes
for
a
qualified
candidate,
that
must
be
counted
in
a
quite
serious
way
to
effect
legal
change.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
some
states
do
and
some
states
don't.
i
think
as
we
have
surveyed
the
statutory
framework,
most
states
say
the
candidate
who
fails
to
file
properly,
shortly
before
an
election,
is
ineligible
to
hold
office
and
the
vote
won't
be
counted.
but
there
are
some
states,
for
example,
georgia,
that
has
a
filing
deadline
that
continues
to
count
the
votes,
and
in
fact,
there
was
an
unreported
federal
district
court
decision
in
the
1980s,
james
against
falagant,
where
the
voters
voted
into
office,
in
essence,
an
individual
who
did
not
properly
register.
and
the
question
in
that
circumstance
was
whether
hawaii's
prohibition
against
that
individual
from
serving
had
to
be
recognized,
or
whether,
when
the
voters
vote
in
somebody
who
hadn't
complied
with
the
filing
requirements
and
therefore
was
ineligible,
whether
that
person
had
nonetheless
to
be
seated,
and
the
federal
district
court
concluded
that
the
ineligibility
would
stand
and
that
the
individual
wouldn't
be
seated,
but
the
vote
is
recognized
as
a
protest
vote.
mr.
arthur
n.
eisenberg
no,
that
in
fact
is
the
appropriate
approach
we
think.
what
is
at
stake
in
this
case
is
the
right
of
the
voters
to
choose,
petitioner's
right
to
direct
his
portion
of
sovereign
power
to
the
candidate
of
his
choice.
this
right,
we
say,
is
not
an
absolute
right.
many
states
regulate
write-in
voting
in
a
variety
of
ways,
with
specific
focused
concerns,
and
those
regulatory
measures
at
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
what
is
at
issue
is
the
application
of
hawaii's
total
prohibition
against
all
write-in
voting
in
all
elections
and
under
all
circumstances.
that
total
prohibition,
we
think,
cannot
satisfy
the
standard
articulated
by
this
court
in
anderson
against
celebrezze.
that
total
prohibition
cannot
be
shown
necessary
to
the
advancement
of
any
substantial
governmental
interest,
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
