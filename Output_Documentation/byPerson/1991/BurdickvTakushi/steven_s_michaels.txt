mr.
steven
s.
michaels
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset
of
our
argument,
we
would
like
to
emphasize
three
very
brief
points
that
we
would
like
to
carry
through
our
discussion
with
the
court,
and
which
we
would
urge
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
as
it
deliberates
upon
this
important
case.
first,
hawaii
is
simply
not
in
a
small
minority
of
states
when
it
comes
to
the
issue
that
is
actually
presented
by
this
case,
because
rather
than
the
mere
4
states
that
mr.
eisenberg
refers
to,
well
over
30
states,
and
in
fact,
by
our
count,
37
states
do
not
permit
what
mr.
burdick
claims
the
constitution
compels,
namely
the
right
at
primaries
and
general
elections
to
vote
for
whomever
one
pleases.
second,
if
this
case
is
about
voting,
then
this
case
is
governed
by
this
court's
ballot
access
decisions.
voting
is
very
different
from
generalized
speech.
it
is
the
casting
of
legally
effective
speech,
and
under
the
ballot
access
decisions
of
this
court,
hawaii's
law
is
plainly
constitutional
because
viewed
as
a
whole
it
does
not
substantially
burden
mr.
burdick's
ability
to
cast
an
effective
vote,
and
if
there
is
any
substantial
burden,
those
burdens
are
justified
by
hawaii's
compelling
interest
in
narrowing
the
field
of
eligible
candidates
for
the
general
election
and
promoting
an
informed
vote.
and
third,
to
the
degree
mr.
burdick
is
saying
that
hawaii
need
not
seat
a
write-in
candidate
who
would
get
a
certain
number
of
votes,
but
that
nonetheless,
hawaii
must
count
up
and
publish
that
speech,
this
case
is
not
governed
by
the
questions
of
substantial
burdens
or
the
issue
of
compelling
state
interests.
it
is
merely
controlled
by
the
question
established
by
this
court's
public
forum
cases,
namely
whether
hawaii
has
acted
neutrally
in
excluding
the
purely
advisory
question
from
the
ballot,
i
quote,
if
you
don't
like
all
of
the
people
on
this
list,
who
would
you
vote
for?
that
advisory
question
hawaii
has
excluded
in
a
neutral
fashion,
and
because
the
answer...
that
answer
to
the
public
forum
question
runs
in
our
favor,
hawaii's
law
is
constitutional
and
mr.
burdick
is
entitled
to
no
relief
from
the
federal
courts.
as
the
argument
in
the
briefs
and
the
discussion
has
established,
it
has
to
be
the
case
that
states
have
the
authority
under
our
constitution
to
exclude
the
ability
of
voters
to
cast
write-in
votes
for
broad
classes
of
candidates.
in
fact,
mr.
burdick
really
doesn't
contend
otherwise.
he
says
that
we
need
not
seat
ineligible
candidates.
we
need
not
seat
primary
losers,
and
we
need
not
seat
late
filers.
and
if
one
just
looks,
for
example,
at
what
the
right
to
vote
means
in
our
country,
it
has
to
mean
that.
because
in
our
nation,
and
as
this
court
has
defined
what
voting
means
in
a
constitutional
sense,
the
right
to
vote
is
preservative
of
other
rights,
as
this
court
said
in
the
yick
wo
v.
hopkins
case,
because
the
right
to
vote
is
legally
effective
speech.
it
is
the
right,
when
joined
with
other
votes,
to
transfer
power.
now
it
is
true
that
not
all
votes
end
up
in
seating
a
particular
candidate,
but
the
reason
politicians
worry
about
votes
as
opposed
to
just
ordinary
speech,
which
is
nonetheless
very
important,
is
the
fact
that
votes,
if
there
are
enough
of
them,
put
you
out
of
a
job.
we
have
eligibility
rules
in
our
nation
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
we
have
them
because
some
people,
we
have
determined
as
a
constitutional
matter,
don't
have
enough
experience.
but
we
also
have
eligibility
rules
that
would
serve
to
eliminate
classes
of
candidates
because
they
have
too
much
experience,
term
limits
for
example.
and
one
of
the
great
ironies
of
this
case,
if
write-in
voting
really
means
the
right
to
vote
for
whomever
one
pleases,
is
that
the
term
limit
movement,
which
is
a
widespread
movement
across
this
nation,
would
be
shut
down
at
the
outset
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
and
that--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--well,
the
petitioner,
we
think
has
essentially
conceded
that
hawaii
need
not
seat
anyone
who
in
the
1994
election
would
vote
by
write-in
for
governor
waihee.
his
time
has
come
to
an
end
at
that
time,
and
for
that
reason,
the
term
limit
is
an
effective
ban
that
mr.
burdick
agrees
hawaii
can
effectuate
by
prohibiting
votes
for
that
category
of
candidates.
what
he
is
saying,
hawaii
must
count
up
all
the
protest
speech
that
would
be
cast
at
that
time
for
people
that
want
governor
waihee
to
keep
serving,
but
we
need
not
seat
governor
waihee
for
a
third
term.
and
what
we
are
contending
to
the
court
is
that
that
protest
speech
is
a
public
forum
question.
it
is
not
a
voting
question
because
what
is
being
cast
by
that
protest
speech
is
not
a
vote
at
all.
i
hope
i
answered
the
question.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
we
understand
that
concession.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
that's
true...
well,
we
do
accept
the
concessions.
i
suppose
my
argument
was
even
if
they
hadn't
conceded
that,
they
would
have
to
concede
that.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
there
is
probably
a
little
bit
of
that
on
both
sides,
but
i
accept
the
criticism.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
the
point
that
we
would
emphasize
to
the
court
also
in
considering
this
case
is
that
this
is
very...
at
its
outset,
a
facial
challenge
to
hawaii's
ban
on
write-in
voting.
the
petitioner,
even
in
the
1986
state
house
race
that
was
before
the
court,
never
said
who
he
wanted
to
vote
for,
never
said
whether
the
person
he
wanted
to
vote
for
was
in
fact
donald
duck
or
someone
who
was
not
eligible
or
so
on.
and
under
that
situation,
the
court
should
not
be
speculating
as
to
all
the
possible
ranges
of
situations
in
which
our
law
might
operate
in
a
tough
manner.
on
a
facial
challenge,
you
look
to
see
whether
there
is
any
circumstance
in
which
the
law
can
be
validly
applied,
and
the
petitioner
has
virtually
conceded
that
there
are
large
numbers
of
cases
in
which
it
can.
secondly,
the
petitioner
did
not
make
any
record
below
concerning
the
burden
that
our
law
may
impose
upon
him.
there
was
none
of
the
typical
testimony
or
evidence
that
one
finds
in
the
voting
cases
that
have
come
up
through
the
courts
of
appeals,
that
we
really
tried
to
get
the
signatures
but
we
couldn't;
it
was
too
hard
to
get
the
signatures
at
that
time
of
year.
none
of
that...
there
is
no
such
testimony
in
this
record.
and
the
record
from
our
side
of
the
case
shows
that
there
are
large
numbers
of
third
parties
that
exist
and
have
existed
in
hawaii
and
large
numbers
of
nonpartisan
candidates
who
make
it
through
the
primary
stage.
our
hawaii
law
is
structured
around
a
four-part
process;
the
party
petition
process
which
commences
with
the
filing
of
the
party
petitions
in
april;
there
is
the
candidate
filing
deadline
in
july;
there
is
the
primary
in
september;
and
then
the
general
election.
and
hawaii's
law
should
be
particularly
amenable
to
being
sustained
by
this
court
because
it
creates
two
cumulative
opportunities
for
voters
like
mr.
burdick
to
get
the
candidates
they
want
on
the
ballot.
we
do
have
a
petition
route,
and
you
can
guarantee
access
for
your
chosen
candidates
by
filing
the
petitions
equal
to
1
percent
of
the
general
electorate
vote
by
april,
and
we
have
a
primary
route.
and
the
routes
are
structured
in
a
manner
so
that
those
persons
who
try
to
file
for
that
automatic
access
in
april
have
that
90-day
period
between
the
april
deadline
and
the
july
candidate
filing
deadline
in
which
all
of
the
litigation
that
typically
occurs
about
petitions
must
occur.
the
lieutenant
governor
must
make
his
decision
on
the
petitions
within
30
days.
there
is
an
administrative
appeal
authorized
under
our
little
apa
for
the
last
60
days;
and
for
those
persons
who
are
disqualified
from
that
automatic
access
by
the
april
deadline,
they
have
the
right
to
bail
out
and
get
back
into
the
game
by
filing
for
a
nonpartisan
slot.
and
what
we
would
emphasize
to
the
court
also
is
that
you
can
file
a
party
petition
even
if
you
are
just
a
single
candidate.
this
is
not
the
situation
that
the
court
referred
to
in
storer
v.
brown
where
you
have
to
bring
all
this
party
baggage
with
you
to
file
at
the
april
deadline.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
that's
right.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
right.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
well,
your
honor
raised
two
hypotheticals
and
the
statute
deals
with
them
differently.
in
the
case
of
death,
withdrawal
or
substitution,
the
relevant
statutes
are
hawaii
revised
statute
sections
11-117
and
11-118,
which
appear
in
our
brief.
and
the
way
those
work
for
those
three
categories
of
postfiling
events,
there
are
rules
of
succession.
within
a
certain
number
of
days,
the
candidate
can
withdraw
and
the
party
can
actually
get
a
new
name
on
the
ballot.
it
doesn't
work
for
independent
candidacies
because
of
the
way
the
independent
candidacies
are
structured,
that
is
it--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--the
law
does
not
allow
that,
and
if
i
may
respond
further
to
explain
why,
hawaii's
law
is
set
up
sort
of
as
a
corollary
to
abraham
lincoln's
famous
saying,
you
can
fool
all
of
the
people
some
of
the
time,
and
some
of
the
people
all
of
the
time.
our
theory
behind
our
law
is
that
you
are
going
to
fool
a
lot
less
of
the
people
all
of
the
time
if
there
is
mandatory
competition
between
the
candidates.
and
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
gap
time
at
which
things
can't
be
changed,
and
at
that
point
the
processes
of
impeachment
and
recall
are
the
recourses
for
the
electorate.
this
is
a
problem,
of
course,
that
we
have
in
between
elections
generally
in
this
nation.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
it
is
a
problem
of
republican
forms
of
government,
small
r.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
well,
not
in
35
states
because,
or
at
least
in
the
big
block
of
27
states
that
have
filing
deadlines.
in
all
of
those
states
the
legislative
judgment
has
been
made
that
at
some
point
we
are
going
to
flush
the
candidates
out,
and
in
fact,
if
i
just
might
focus
on
a
few
of
the
states
that
have
filing
deadlines,
some
of
them
do
come
fairly
early
in
the
process.
florida
comes
100
days.
that
is
our
deadline.
arkansas
is
60
days.
new
mexico,
56
days;
texas,
55
days.
we
admit,
other
states
make
different
judgments
about
when
that
filing
deadline
should
occur.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
that's
correct,
sir.
our
basic,
our
system
is
structured
in
a
way
so
that
not
only
can
an
individual
get
on
the
ballot
through
the
automatic
access
in
april,
because
you
don't
have
to
have
party
committees,
party
officers,
or
rules.
the
statute
admonishes
you
to
file
them
if
you
have
them,
but
if
you
don't
have
them,
you
won't
be
kicked
off
the
ballot.
but
it
also
allows
the
party
candidates
whose
petitions
fail
to
get
on
the
ballot
through
the
nonpartisan
process...
there
is
no
disaffiliation
requirement
under
hawaii
law,
and
so
it
is
truly
a
case
where
hawaii
has
two
complementary
and
each
equally
available
systems
for
getting
on
to
the
ballot.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
under
this
court's
cases
in
munro
v.
socialist
workers'
party
is
we
submit
our
best
case,
that
our
system
is
wholly
constitutional,
and
there
is
really
no
argument
by
the
petitioner
that
it
is
not.
there
are
a
couple
of
footnotes
in
the
brief
criticizing
parts
of
the
law,
but
there
is
no
extended
argument
looking
into
the
court's
cases
and
what
the
court
has
decided
in
these
cases,
to
challenge
as
a
constitutional
matter
our
law.
and
if
one
looks
to
the
principles
that
the
court
adopted
in
the
munro
case,
that
access
at
the
primary
stage
alone
would
be
sufficient,
we
have
that
automatic
backup
that
you
can
get
into
at
april
with
a
1
percent
signature
requirement
that
is
equally
sufficient
and
makes
our
law
doubly
good.
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
therefore
has
a
right
to
say
that
there
wasn't
any
substantial
burden
on
mr.
burdick's
constitutional
interests,
and
the
court
need
not
get
to
the
second
step
of
the
analysis,
as
to
compelling
interest,
except
perhaps
to
note
that
there
is
a
rational
relationship
between
the
laws,
the
goals
that
we
have,
and
the
law
that
is
adopted.
and
we
think
that
that
should
be
the
proper
way
for
the
court
to
decide
the
case.
but
even
if
one
gets
over
that
hump,
hawaii's
law
is
backed
by
compelling
state
interests
at
every
turn
that
are
narrowly
tailored
to
the
way
that
the
law
is
written.
you
simply
cannot
have
the
kind
of
informed
voting
that
hawaii
mandates
unless
you
have
deadlines
that
stick,
and
although
mr.
burdick
concedes
that
the
sore-loser
interest
is
only
a
narrow
one,
we
urge
the
court
to
look
at
judge
easterbrook's
opinion
in
the
seventh
circuit
case.
a
lot
more
people
than
just
the
candidates
are
mad
after
the
primary.
our
eligibility
requirements,
those
are
conceded
to
be
valid
and
can
be
enforced,
and
at
the
primary
there
is
an
important
interest
in
respecting
the
party's
ability
to,
in
a
sense,
have
their
own
house
in
order.
now,
mr.
burdick
says
that
it
is
enough
just
to
say
that
in
hawaii
our
laws
provide
that
you
have
to
be
a
member
of
the
party
in
order
to
be
a
party
candidate
at
the
primary.
but
time
is
really
of
the
essence
in
election
law,
and
the
point
we
wish
to
make
with
respect
to
the
party
raiding
argument
is
that
the
parties
need
not
just
to
have
this
requirement
out
there,
but
they
need
the
time
to
make
that
requirement
effective
by
looking
at
the
filing
deadline
to
see
if
there
really
is
a
bona
fide
person
who
is
a
member
of
their
party
running
in
the
primary,
and
then
to
go
to
court
and
to
use
the
time
we
provide
to
go
to
court,
if
in
fact
they
have
a
beef
about
that.
and
as
far
as
the
runaway
primary
winner
argument
goes,
it
is
true
that
in
the
federal
races
and
state-wide
office,
a
person
isn't
automatically
seated.
but
in
that
instance,
as
i
explained
to
justice
stevens,
we
have
provisions
for
succession
in
the
case
of
death,
withdrawal
or
substitution,
and
those
rules
of
succession
respect
the
primary
mandate,
and
the--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--our
interest
at
the
primary
stage
in
banning
write-in
voting,
in
part,
not...
we
have
interests
that
cover
it
otherwise,
but
in
part
is
justified
by
a
party
raiding
interest.
in
avoiding
the
situation
where
you
have
a
democrat
in
sheep's
clothing,
as
it
were,
running
in
the
republican
primary
and
then
strategic
voting
by
democrats
basically,
you
get
a
weak
republican
candidate
to
run
against
the
democrats.
this
court
has
recognized
that
as
an
interest.
hawaii,
in
our
statutes--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--only
registered
republicans.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
that's
true
that
that
is
one
way,
but
we
have
chosen
to
balance
the
question
a
little
differently.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
in
our
state,
we
do
have
an
open
primary,
and
this
is
recognized
because
for
a
large
number
of
races
the
democratic
primary
was
determinative,
and
it
remained
so
in
large
numbers
of
races.
but
for
the
protection
of
the
republican
party
and
the
libertarian
party
and
any
other
party
that
exists
in
hawaii,
what
we
do
is
two
things.
one,
we
say
that
the
candidates
who
run
in
the
primary
have
got
to
be
party
members;
and
secondly,
we
provide
that
60-day
period
between
the
filing
deadline
and
the
primary
date
for
the
party
itself
to
go
to
court
and
say,
this
person
isn't
really
a
republican
or
this
person
is
not
a
democrat
or
not
a
libertarian
or
whatever.
and
under
mr.
burdick's
theory
of
write-in
voting
at
the
primary,
what
he
is
saying
is
that
you
can
have
last-minute
nominations
by
write-in.
if
he
is
really
serious
about
that,
that
period
of
time
that
the
state
gives
to
the
parties
to
go
to
court
and
effectuate
their
own
interests
is
gone,
and
that
is
why
we
believe
we
have
a
legitimate
narrowly
tailored
party
raiding
interest.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
that's
correct.
in
large
measure
this
case
is
not
about
write-in
voting
at
all,
because
mr.
burdick
has
said
that
there
are
broad
classes
of
candidates
where
he
is
asking
not
that
a
candidate
be
seated
or
that
politicians
need
worry
about
write-in
votes
in
the
manner
that
i
described
before,
but
he
is
asking
that
hawaii,
at
its
own
expense,
count
up
what
he
writes
on
his
ballot
and
publish
it
in
the
lieutenant
governor's
reports.
if
i
could
just,
at
this
point,
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
71
of
the
ja,
these
are
sample
ballots
and
this
is
the
way
the
ballot
looks
to
the
voter
on
election
day.
these
were
the
facsimile
ballots
in
the
1986
election.
and
we
can
state
to
the
court
with
confidence,
it
is
no
crime
in
hawaii
to
write
in
on
your
ballot,
but
we
are
not
going
to
count
it
up
and
we
are
not
going
to
publish
it,
and
that
is
the
law
in
hawaii
if
you
write
a
message
on
your
ballot.
what
we
are
contending
under
that
set
of
undisputed
facts
is
that
this
is
a
case
about
a
claim
for
state
subsidization
of
protest
speech.
actually,
it
wouldn't
matter
if
mr.
burdick
wrote
in
and
said
the
lieutenant
governor
is
a
great
guy.
we
are
not
going
to
publish
that
either.
so
whether
it
is
favorable
or
not
favorable,
we
just
don't
publish
what
is
written
in
on
the
ballot
if
it
is
not
punched
and
executed
in
a
manner
required
by
law.
and
under
the
court's
decisions,
the
cornelius
case
is
certainly
a
very
powerful
case
for
us.
this
is
a
matter
that
the
state
can
regulate,
how
it
publishes
the...
and
what
questions
it
will
address
at
the
ballot.
judge
posner
in
the
georges
v.
carney
case
put
it
very
well,
a
state
could
decide
to
have
the
advisory
question
of
who
if
not
these
do
you
want
regardless
of
whether
they
could
be
seated,
but
hawaii,
along
with
a
large
number
of
states
has
decided
not
to
do
that,
and
that
is
a
legitimate
decision
to
make.
i
might
just
add
that
in
that
regard,
our
law
would
also
be
justified
as
a
time,
place
and
manner
restriction
at
the
ballot
because
what
you
are
saying,
if
there
is
this
right
to
cast
this
advisory
speech,
is
that
you
must
double
the
election
ballot,
that
there
is
an
advisory
question
tacked
on
to
every
single
race
from
governor
on
down,
and
that
conceptual
overcrowding
of
the
ballot
is
something
that
hawaii
has
an
interest
in
avoiding.
and
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
we
rest
on
the
briefs,
and
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
