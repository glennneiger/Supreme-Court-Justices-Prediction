justice
souter
can
you
engage
in
activities
to
stimulate
sales,
since
the
ultimate
purpose
of
doing
that
is
of
course
to
stimulate
orders?
justice
souter
if
the
salesman
arrives
for
the
first
time
at
a
store
and
says
we'll
give
you
all
of
these
posters
to
display
in
the
store
that
advertise
the
virtues
of
the
gum,
pictures
of
the
twins,
and
so
on,
is
that
impermissible?
justice
souter
what
about
renting
newspaper
space
for
advertising
in
local
papers
or
renting
radio
time?
is
that
like
the
posters?
justice
souter
haven't
you
slipped
pretty
far
down
the
slope
when
you
let
the...
when
you
let
the
salesman
go
out
and
start
renting
or
buying
radio
time
and
taking
out
newspaper
ads?
in
the
case
of
giving
him
the
posters,
you
can
say,
well
that
is...
he's
only
dealing
with
the
person
from
whom
he
wants
to
solicit
the
order.
but
when
you
let
him
start
going
out
to
address
the
world
in
general,
that
is
no
longer
true.
and
why
on
your
view
doesn't
that
cross
the
line
from
what
is
integrally
related
to
an
entirely
separate
activity,
and
therefore
subject
to
tax?
justice
souter
i
think
that's
what
i
was
assuming
in
my
question,
yeah.
that's
why
i...
your
answer
surprised
me
somewhat.
justice
souter
i
probably
wasn't
clear.
in
any
case,
you're
receding
from
the
answer
that
i
thought
you
were
giving.
i
think
he
is,
yes.
what
if
the
customer
says,
gosh,
i'll
order
a
lot
of
this
gum,
but
how
do
i
know
i
can
sell
it.
will
you
agree
to
take
a
space
in
the
denver
post
and
help
me
sell
this
gum.
and
he
says,
sure.
make
it
the
milwaukee
journal.
[laughter]
that's
all
right,
too.
so
i
mean,
his
order...
his
order
is
conditioned
on
your
agreeing
to
take
out
the
ad.
and
you
say
sure,
and
he
gives
you
an
order.
justice
souter
but
de
minimis
or
not,
it
was
a
sale
of
gum.
justice
souter
well,
it
was
not
a
sale
to
a
consumer,
but
neither
was
it
a
gift
to
the
retailer
as
an
inducement.
it
was
in
fact
a
sale
to
the
retailer.
