justice
o'connor
well,
it
could
be
seen
as
part
of
the
overall
solicitation,
saying
this
is
the
kind
of
service
that
we
routinely
perform
and
therefore
you
ought
to
deal
with
us.
justice
o'connor
no,
of
course.
but
it's
the
sale
that
we're
talking
about
that
would
be
the
measure
of
the
tax.
but
presumably
do
you
take
the
position
that
nothing
that
enhances
the
chances
of
making
the
sale
can
be
done
and
fall
within
the
exemption?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
there
a
de
minimis
concept
that
we
should
accept
here?
it
certainly
isn't
reflected
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
we
have
to
worry
about
the
word
"only"
that
appears
in
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
are
there
any
cases
that
you
rely
on
for
the
proposition
that
there's
a
de
minimis
exception
in
this
kind
of
tax
situation?
justice
o'connor
yeah,
but
the
argument
is
that
you
have
different
presumptions
that
play
when
it's
a
tax
case
and
when
it
is
restricting
the
state's
otherwise
existent
jurisdiction
to
tax.
justice
o'connor
well,
there's
a
wide
variety,
is
there
not,
among
the
states
as
to
what
exemptions
they
say
are
covered
and
what
aren't?
