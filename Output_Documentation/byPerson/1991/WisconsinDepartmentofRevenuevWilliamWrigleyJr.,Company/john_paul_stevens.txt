justice
stevens
may
i
ask
about
the
storage?
how
long...
one
salesman
was
it
rented
the
space
for
a
while
and
then
used
the
gum.
and
the
answer
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
as
i
remember
it
was
it
was
de
minimis,
that
it
if
it
had
been
a
routine...
major
part
of
the,
you
know,
regular
storage
of
stuff
that's
delivered,
it
would
be
different.
do
you
recognize
any
de
minimis
exception?
and
if
you
don't...
or
if
you
do,
why
doesn't
this
come
within
it?
justice
stevens
what
about
a
warehouse
to
store
the
posters
in?
justice
stevens
can
i
just
ask
one
other
little...
maybe
this
is
stupid,
but
supposing
we
could
identify
the
percentage
of
wrigley's
business
that
was
done
in
the
ways
that
you
say
established
something
more
than
solicitation
in
the
state.
would
that,
in
your
view,
entitle
wisconsin
to
tax
the
portion
of
their
income
attributable
to
those
activities,
or
would
it
then
allow
you
to
tax
all
the
income
they've
gotten
from
everything
else
they've
done?
justice
stevens
has
anybody
passed...
have
courts
passed
on
that
particular
point
i've
raised?
you
see,
the
text
of
the
statute,
i
think,
is
somewhat
ambiguous
on
that
point.
justice
stevens
so
that
if
99
percent
of
their
sales
and
solicitations
were
exempt
under
the
statute,
but
they
have
1
percent
that
is
generated
by
an...
by
a
taxable
method,
the
whole
100
percent
becomes
taxable.
justice
stevens
but
it's
either
all...
it's
always
an
all
or
none
proposition.
justice
stevens
but
may
i
just
interrupt
there?
justice
stevens
you
said
minor
exception
to
the
normal
practice,
but
we're
talking
about
a
normal
practice,
aren't
we,
the
replacing
of
stale
gum
and
doing
this
delivery
and
having
this
billing
you
described
here?
justice
stevens
well,
aren't
they
both
normal
practices?
justice
stevens
does
the
retailer
pay
for
the
fresh
gum
that's
used
to
replace
the
stale
gum?
justice
stevens
can
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
stale
gum?
what
did
your
figure
of
7/100,
000
of
1
percent
pay
into?
of
all
of
these
activities
or
the
smallest
of
the
group?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
but
that's
just
the
agency
stock.
justice
stevens
that
didn't
include,
for
example,
replacing
the
stale
gum.
justice
stevens
how
big
a
percentage
is
that?
justice
stevens
do
you
know
how
big
a
percentage
that
is?
justice
stevens
eighty-five
percent
is
used
to
replace
stale
gum.
justice
stevens
would
the
case
be
different
if
instead
of
replacing
stale
gum,
you
bought
it
back?
justice
stevens
i'm...
not
sale.
if
you
bought
from
the
retailer
his
stale
inventory,
you
paid
him
for
it,
and
then
sold
him,
would
that
be
a
different
case?
justice
stevens
well,
because
you
don't
want
him
to
sell
that.
he's
got
some
merchandise
that
you
think
is
going
to
hurt
the
goodwill
of
your
company.
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
right
there?
justice
stevens
i
take
it
a
regular
practice
of
delivering
gum
by
the
salesman
would
not
constitute
solicitation.
and
i
would...
the
problem
i
have
with
your
example
is
i
wouldn't...
it
would
fit
perfectly
if
he
took
away
the
stale
gum
and
then
said
i'll
give
you
a
free
order
and
have
the
wholesaler
ship
it
into
you.
so
that...
but
he
is
doing
the
delivering
himself,
on
a
regular
basis,
of
a
portion
of
the
inventory
sold
by
the
retailer.
and
that's
the
question
that
troubles
me
the
most.
justice
stevens
no,
what's
in
the
store
is
the
gum
that's
being
exchanged.
the
stuff
he's
delivered
hasn't
been
ordered.
do
you...
it
would
be...
see,
what
i'm
saying
is
it
would
be
a
quite
different
case
if
the
replacement
gum
were
shipped
by
the
wholesaler...
free.
but
he
just
takes
away
the
old.
and
taking
away
the
old
gum,
no
problem.
but
delivering
the
new
gum,
that's
what
troubles
me.
justice
stevens
i
don't
know
if
i
understand
that
argument.
because
a
small
business
could
make
de
minimis
mistakes,
too,
and
be
protected.
i
mean,
a
small
business
isn't
one
that
has
only
$600
of
sales.
that
can
have
a
couple
hundred
thousand
and
still
be
a
small
business.
justice
stevens
what
i'm
saying
is
if
there's
a
de
minimis
exception,
the
small
business
will
get
the
benefit
of
it
as
much
as
the
big
business.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
another
problem.
but
i
just
don't
buy
your
argument
that
it's
loaded
one
way
or
another
based
on
the
size
of
the
company.
at
least
i
don't
understand
it
on
that
basis.
justice
stevens
just
because
you're
such
a
worthy
opponent.
[laughter]
