mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
general
creeron
has
touched
upon
a
number
of
activities
that
he
says
that
we
engaged
in,
and
i'm
going
to
deal
with
those
in
just
a
moment.
but
i
thought
it
might
be
helpful
in
starting
just
to
focus
on
some
of
the
things
that
we
didn't
do
in
wisconsin
in
an
effort
to
comply
with
this
statute.
we
were
not,
for
example,
licensed
within
the
state.
we
didn't
have
a
bank
account
there.
we
didn't
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
any
wisconsin
court.
we
didn't
own
real
estate
or
a
manufacturing
plant
or
a
sales
office
or
a
warehouse.
we
didn't
collect
delinquent
accounts
or
investigate
credit-worthiness
or
grant
credit
or
handle
complaints.
we
didn't
approve
or
accept
orders.
we
didn't
hire
or
fire
within
the
state.
we
didn't
even
have
a
listing
in
the
phone
book.
and
when
the
salesman
gave
out
cards,
they
had--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
illinois
did.
the
office
in...
the
wrigley
office,
but
it
was
not
done
in
wisconsin.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
wisconsin
office,
whenever
a
prospective
customer
came
in,
the
name
was
forwarded
to
illinois
for
a
number
of
reasons,
among
them,
to
make
sure
that
they
could
pay
their
bills.
and
wisconsin...
i'm
sorry,
illinois--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--yes,
they
would
either
send
in
a
written
notice--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--no,
to
illinois.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
have
no
idea
how
they
checked
the
credit.
i
assume
they
looked
up--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
the--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--what
this
record
reflects,
justice
white,
is
that
credit
matters
were
handled
out
of
chicago.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
what
the
record
reflects.
as
i
was
about
to
say--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--the
cards
that
the
salesmen
gave
out
didn't
even
have
a
wisconsin
address
or
telephone
number
on
it.
i
touch
on
that
because
we
were
making
obviously
an
honest
effort
to
comply
with
this
statute.
now,
general
creeron
has
focused
on
the
word
"solicitation",
but
i
would
remind
you
that
that's
not
what
that
statute
talks
about.
the
statute
talks
about
business
activities
within
the
state,
which
are
the
solicitation
of
orders.
it's
the
business
activities
that
we're
trying
to
determine
the
meaning
of
here.
i
would
further
point
out
that
he
said
that
this
statute
abridged
the
state's
taxing
authority.
in
fact,
this
statute
is
an
allocation
statute,
because
what
you
have
here
is
all
of
wrigley's
orders
or
business
in
wisconsin
is
presently
taxed
in
illinois...
100
percent
of
it.
so
what
this
statute
does
is
say
that
that
is
where
it
should
be
taxed.
on
the
other
hand,
if
wisconsin
was
going
to
tax
some
of
these
activities,
then
under
the
so-called
reverse
nexus
rule,
illinois
would
not
tax
so...
those
particular
activities.
so
this
doesn't
take
power
away
from
the
states
to
tax,
what
it
does
is
to
allocate
power
between
the
states
that
can
tax.
what
we--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--absolutely.
and
in
fact
i...
we
don't
contest
that
there's
nexus
in
this
case.
this
is
not
a
quill
case.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
nexus.
we
would
concede
immediately
that
there's
nexus
to
tax.
what
i
meant
by
that
was
it
isn't
as
if
it
was
telling
the
states
you
cannot
tax
this
activity.
what
it
is
is
saying
that
illinois
can
tax
it,
but
wisconsin
can't.
it
allocates
that
power
between
the
states.
now,
general
creeron,
if
i
understood
him,
in
answer
to
a
question
from
justice
souter,
conceded
that
dropping
off
posters
would
be
part
of
the
business
activities
that
was
covered
here.
and
he
said
because
that's
inextricably
bound
up
in
the
solicitation
process.
that
is
our
case.
that
is
our
position,
that
everything
that
we
did
was
either
inextricably
bound
up
in
the
solicitation
process
or
it
was
of
a
de
minimis
nature.
now
let
me
go
to
the
four
or
five
points
that
he
mentioned
that
he
thought
went
too
far.
and
the
first
was
what
he
called
the
agency
stock
transfers.
this
was
not
a--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--the
agency
stock
transfers.
this
is
not
a
sale.
there
was
no
price
involved,
no
billing,
no
money
accepted,
no
invoice.
what
this
was
was
really
an
internal
check
of
the
company
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
sale.
and
it
was
also
de
minimis.
and
it
was
established
that
it
represented
7/100,
000
of
1
percent
of
the
business
done
there.
and
what
this
process
was,
it
was
very
simple.
if
you
went
in,
for
example,
to
a
new
customer,
say
a
retailer,
and
he's
found
that
he
didn't
have
any
gum
on
his
shelf.
you
said...
and
you
want
to
get
him
as
a
customer
and
you
want
to
solicit
his
sales,
you
took
out
some
gum
from
your
car,
and
you
put
it
on
the
shelf,
and
you
said,
look,
try
this
and,
you
know,
we'll
get
some
orders
from
you.
then
you
made
out
one
of
these
agency
stock
transfers
and
you
sent
it
either
to
the
wholesaler
or
to
the
company,
which
in
turn
would
bill.
that's
all
it
was.
it
represented,
it
was
estimated,
like
5
percent
of
the
gum
that
was
carried
in
the
car.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
either
the
wholesaler
billed
that...
retailer,
or
if
it
was
a
large
account,
wrigley
billed
the
whole...
the
retailer.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
it
was
not...
it
was
not
a
sale...
i
don't
think
it
was
a
sale
in
the
normal
sense,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--if
it
will
help
move
us
along,
i
will
say
it's
a
sale
because
it
was
totally
de
minimis.
i...
when
i
said
it
wasn't
a
sale,
i
meant
it
wasn't
in
the
normal
sense
of
a
sale
where
you
go
and
tell
the
fellow
the
price
and
you
haggle
with
him.
and
then
you...
he
pays
you
the
money
and
you
give
him
the
gum.
that
isn't
how
it
happened.
but
i
would
concede
that
if
this
was
the
way
that
the
company
did
business
on
a
regular
basis
with
all
of
its
people,
it
could
possibly
go
beyond
solicitation.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
you
have
an
activity
that
is
7/100,
000
of
1
percent
of
your
business,
surely,
once
you
accept
the
de
minimis
concept,
you
would
have
to
say
that
that's
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
don't
think
most
statutes
that
have
a
de
minimis
exception
to
them
express
language
in
that
way,
justice
o'connor.
i
would
point
out
that
not
only
has
this
court
recognized
a
de
minimis
exception
in
numerous
cases,
but
congress
itself
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
referred
to
de
minimis
exceptions.
petitioner's
own
regulations
implicitly
recognize
have
been
de
minimis
exceptions.
some
of
the
state--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--you
know
it's
interesting,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
statute
and
take
out
the
word
"only",
i
think
the
statute
would
mean
exactly
the
same
thing.
"only",
i
think
is
a
matter
of
emphasis.
i
would
certainly
agree
with
you
on
that.
but
if
it
said
no
state
shall
have
power
to
impose
a
net
income
tax
if
the
business
activities
are
the
solicitation
of
orders,
it
would
mean
exactly
the
same
thing.
so
i
take
the
word
"only"
to
be
a
matter
of
emphasis,
but
i
don't
see
that
it
does
away
with
a
de
minimis
exception
at
all.
some
of
the
amici
in
this
very
case
that
support
petitioner
agree
that
there
is
a
de
minimis
exception.
and
i
would
remind
you,
for
example,
of
the
abbott
labs
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
there
you
have
a...
it
was
a
robinson-patman
exemption
for
sales
to
nonprofit
hospitals
that
used
the
goods
for
their
own
use.
and
the
question
came
up,
well,
what
about
purchases
for
walk-ins?
and
you
said,
well,
walk-ins
wouldn't
be
for
the
hospital's
use,
and
then
somebody
said,
yeah,
but
what
about
emergencies
where
the
walk-ins
are
connected
with
the
hospital.
and
you
said,
well,
that's
de
minimis.
now,
you
carved
that
right
of
the
statute.
so
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question
that
there
has
to
be
a
de
minimis
exception
because
look,
you're
dealing
with
companies
large
and
small
here.
and
to
say
that
the
taxing
authority
can
kind
of
peek
around
the
corner
and
find
in
an
exigent
circumstance
some
exception
during
the
course
of
an
entire
tax
year,
where
somebody
went
a
bit
too
far,
and
that
brings
me
to
the
warehouse
situation--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--in
wisconsin.
no,
only
in
wisconsin.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
i
think
it
relates
either...
can
relate
either
to
the
size
of
the
sales
or
to
kind
of
a
minor
exception
to
your
normal
practice.
and
if
i
can
move
logically
then
to
the
warehouse
situation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
there's
a
big
difference
between
replacement
of
stale
gum
and
the
agency
stock.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
agency
stock
is
a
normal
practice,
but
it's
de
minimis
because
it
constitutes
such
a
tiny
percentage
of
what
we
do.
replacement
of
stale
gum
is
as
inextricably
bound
up
in
solicitation
as
anything
you
can
possibly
conceive.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
he's
already
paid
for
it.
you
see,
the
sale
has
been
made,
the
shipment
has
been
made.
it's
on
his
shelf.
the
salesman
goes
in
and
he
finds
it's
over
6
or
8
months
old,
and
he
says
this
is
out
of
date.
now
why
does
he
do
that?
because
he
knows
that
if
that
salesman
gets
caught
with
stale
gum
and
his
customers
tell
him,
we'll
never
get
another
order.
a
salesman
will
tell
you
that
there's
nothing
more
inextricably
bound
up
in
solicitation
than
replacing
stale
gum.
he's
not
going
to
get
any
orders
unless
he's
got--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--no,
no,
no.
it
would
normally
have
gone
stale
on
his
shelf,
your
honor.
i
hope
we
don't
deliver
stale
gum.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
it's
exchanged
free.
he's
not
charged
for
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
he--
[laughter]
it's
not
in
the
contract,
but
that's
what
we
do
as
part
of
our
solicitation.
because
if
we
put
packs
on
his
shelf
and
then
a
customer
comes
in
and
says,
you
know,
that
stuff
i
chewed
the
other
day
was
hard
as
a
board,
he's
not
going
to
put
any
more
orders
with
us.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
you
make
a
very
good
point.
and
that
is,
what
you
look
to--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--the
fact
that
there
are
some
duties
that
can
go
beyond
solicitation
depending
what
is
customary
in
the
industry.
if...
you
said
technical
people
who
may
go
out...
you
said
two
things.
you
said,
first
of
all,
technical
people,
and
secondly,
you
said
salesmen.
if
they're
technical
people,
they're
not
salesmen
and
they're
not
soliciting.
when
you
look
at
what
a
salesman
ordinarily
does
within
the
industry--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
you'd
look
at
what
was
customary
in
the
industry.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
if
it's
customary
in
the
industry,
and
in
fact
he's
doing
most
of
his
time
selling,
and
as...
he
also
spends
a
portion
of
his
time
doing
something
which
he
thinks
he
has
to
do
in
order
to
get
the
next
order,
then
i
would
say
that
it's
covered
here.
it's
inextricably
bound
up
in
solicitation.
but
if
he's
primarily
a
repairman,
and
we
use
in
our
brief
the
example
of
the
60-ton
generator,
if
somebody's
going
to
go
out
and
fix
that,
that's
not
a
solicitation
of
orders.
if
i
could
move
then
to
the
warehouse
because
something
has
been
made
of
that.
i
mentioned
a
few
minutes
ago
the
exigencies
of
a
given
situation,
and
surely
that
was
this
one.
what
happened
was
somebody
was
fired
and
we
were
stuck
with
his
gum
that
he
had
in
his
car.
and
so
it
was
temporarily
put
into
a
warehouse.
but
then
the
next
fellow
who
came
along
had
an
apartment.
he
couldn't
get
it
in
his
apartment
apparently.
i
don't
know
whether
they
wouldn't
allow
it
in
or
he
didn't
have
room,
or
what.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
not
going
to
touch
that
one.
but...
so
they
kept
the
warehouse
on
for
the
period
when
he
was
aboard
because
they
didn't
have
any
place
else
to
put
it.
now,
that
is
not
the
kind
of
warehouse
that
was
referred
to
in
the
legislative
history,
that
congress
didn't
want
you
to
have
a
plant
or
a
sales
office
or
a
warehouse.
this
was
an
exigent
circumstance
demanded
by
the...
because
you
couldn't
leave
stuff
out
on
the
street.
and
that
again
was
a
de
minimis
situation
under
the
view
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
and
i
would
suggest
to
you,
fully
supported
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
don't
have
a
tax
case
for
you,
but
i
gave
the
example,
your
honor,
of
the
abbott
labs
case,
where
you
did
carve
a
diminishment...
de
minimis
exception
right
out
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
look,
if
i
may
suggest
it,
at
congress
really
had
in
mind
with
this
statute
because
i
don't
think
you
give
it
the
most
conceivably
restrictive
interpretation
that
you
possibly
could.
congress
here
was
worried
about
the
fact
that
you
have
over
6,000
taxing
jurisdictions.
they
have
all
kinds
of
different
bases
and
rates
and
timing
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
and
compliance
with
this
kind
of
local
taxation
was
so
onerous
that
in
some
cases
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
cost
of
compliance
was
more
than
the
tax.
so
that
was
number
one
that
they
were
worried
about.
number
two,
they
were
worried
about
the
possibility
of
double
taxation.
in
the
situation
here,
illinois
would
continue
to
tax
and
wisconsin
taxes,
and
you've
got
double
taxation.
because
of
that,
this
statute
was
overwhelmingly
passed.
the
house
passed
it
359
to
31,
the
senate
did
it
on
house
vote.
it's
been
in
effect
for
30
years
and
more,
since
1959.
congress
has
had
at
least
one
complete
report
on
it,
the
so-called
willis
report
in
1962,
where
they
essentially
approved
of
how
it
was
being
carried
out.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
language
in
some
of
the
decisions
is
widely
varying,
your
honor,
but
i
would
suggest
to
you
i
do
not...
i
think
i
can
honestly
say
i
do
not
know
of
a
single
state
decision
that
i
would
disagree
with
the
result
in,
because
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
they
were
doing
something
which
we
would
concede
is
beyond
solicitation.
so,
although
the
language--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
it
was...
that's
an
interesting
question.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
of
that
is.
it
has
not
been
raised.
i
can
assure
you
that
i
go
back
and
lose
this
case
i
will
argue
that
it's
not
all
or
nothing.
but
what
the
result
would
be,
your
honor,
i
honestly--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--let's
see.
i
have
covered
the
agency
stock.
i
haven't
covered
personnel
or
home
offices.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
replacement
of
stale
and
warehouse.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
shall
i
touch
briefly,
then,
on--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--it
covered
some
$600
worth
of
sales
divided
into
the
total
sales
in
the
state.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
and
the
agency
stock--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
but
that
was...
the
salesman
testified
that
it
was
85
percent
of
the
stock
that
they
kept
on
hand.
and
the
10
percent
was
samples,
and
then
the
5
percent
was
the
agency
stock.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
so
that
ought
to
give
you
some
idea
of
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
if
you
make
an
actual
sales,
as
a--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--you
mean
you
buy
back
what
you've
sold
him?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
in
other
words
you
buy...
the
salesman
on
the
spot
buys
back
the...
i
think
that
could
well
go
beyond
the
statute
because--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--no.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
first
of
all--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--back
during
this
period,
most
of
it
was
packaged
and
sent
back
to
chicago.
a
little
bit
of
it--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--a
little
bit
of
it
was
thrown
into
the
local
dumps.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it's
an
exchange.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
not
for
the
stale
gum.
no,
no.
let's
distinguish
now
between
the
agency
stock,
which
is
a
tiny
little
percentage,
and
the
replacement
of
stale
gum,
which
is
completely
free.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
the
reason
it
is
sent
back
to
chicago
is
that
in
those
days
it
could
become
part
of
new
gum.
it
could
become
a
base
for
new
gum.
that
is
not
longer
done.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
they
treat
it.
if
i
can
deal
with
the
personnel
matter
that
he
mentioned.
personnel
decisions
were
made
in
chicago.
the
final
decisions
were
all
made
in
illinois.
the
local
man,
of
course,
had
to
do
some
things
and
make
recommendations.
but
it's
interesting
that
there
are
instances
in
the
record
where
the
local
man
made
recommendations
about
raises,
for
example,
which
were
turned
down
by
chicago.
in
one
instance
where
they
were
going
to
fire
someone,
the
regional
manager,
who
was
in
wisconsin,
got
permission
ahead
of
time.
he
said
if
the
facts
prove
true,
do
i
have
permission
to
fire
him,
and
they
said
yes,
and
he
fired
him.
so
the
personnel
decisions,
i
think,
are
well
taken
care
of.
they're
outside
the
state.
in
so
far
as
the
home
offices,
which
i
believe
is
the
last
thing
that
general
creeron
mentioned
as
concern,
we
did
not
have
a
sales
office.
there
was
no
evidence
whatever
that
wrigley
knew
about
the
fact
that
this
gum
was
kept
in
the
home.
it
didn't
pay
for
it.
the
use
was
strictly
incidental.
you
had
a
file
cabinet
here
for
your
normal
reports,
or
you
used
the
kitchen
table
or
a
part
of
the
basement.
you
had
one
or
two
meetings
a
year
of
the
sales
personnel,
and
in
one
case
they
were
sent...
they
were
in
the
home.
they
were
usually
in
a
home.
but
the
sales
meetings
were
completely
taken
up
with
solicitation.
that
is,
how
are
we
going
to
sell
more
gum.
and
even
the
manager,
the
regional
manager
who
was
within
wisconsin,
his
chief
job
was
solicitation.
he
spent
from
80
to
95
percent
of
his
time
in
soliciting
orders.
i
think
that's
all
that
the...
that
my
opponent
has
mentioned,
but
i
do
want
to
talk
about
the
pre-sale/post-sale
test
for
just
a
moment.
if
you
look
on
page
2
of
his
reply
brief,
something
that
i
had
noticed
before
in
his
main
brief,
he
says
that
you
don't
have
to
have
a
sale
in
order
for
you
to
be
covered
under
the
pre-sale/post-sale
test.
now
if
that's
true,
it
seems
to
me
we
fit
his
test.
if
you
don't
have
to
have
a
sale,
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
the
activities
that
would
lead
up
to
a
sale,
or
if
you
have
a
sale,
then
you
keep
going
to
try
to
get
the
next
sale,
why,
i
think
we
meet
the
pre-sale/post-sale
test.
or
to
put
it
another
way,
i
don't
thing
the
so-called
pre-sale/post-sale
test
makes
any
sense.
because
certainly
in
the
gum
industry,
and
justice
blackmun,
you
put
your
finger
on
it,
was
that
you
not
only
have
a
short
shelf
life,
but
you
have,
you
know,
95
percent
of
it
is
impulse
buying...
95
percent
is
impulse
buying.
and
so
you...
when
you
put
those
two
together,
what
you
have
there
is
activity
that
is
ongoing
in
every
sense.
the
gum
industry
is
different
from
that
60-ton
generator
that
i
mentioned
to
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
at
all.
i
think
it...
first
of
all,
you're
looking
for
a
criteria.
i
would
say
that
the
business
activities...
and
don't
forget
i
go
back
to
that.
it's
just
not
solicitation.
it
is
the
business
activities
that
are
solicitation.
the
business
activities
that
are
covered
are
those
which
are
directed
toward
achieving
an
immediate
or
a
future
sale,
and
which
is
normally
done
by
a
salesman
or
a
supervising
salesman
in
that
industry.
now,
that
is
not
different
than
the
kinds
of
determinations
that
have
to
be
made
all
the
time,
based
on
custom
and
usage
in
an
industry...
in
tax
matters.
for
example,
section
482
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
where
a
company's
lending
money
to
a
foreign
sub,
says
you
can
charge
the
interest
rate
that's
customary
in
the
industry.
and
the
irs--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
don't
we
have
to
be
practical
about
this,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--try
to
make
sense
out
of
what
congress
did.
they
obviously
intended
something
by
this
statute,
and
i
think
what
they
intended
was
that
whatever
you
normally
do
for...
to
solicit
orders
is
what
is
covered.
and
what
salesmen
do
not
ordinarily
do
is
not
cover
it,
absent
a
de
minimis
exception.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
can
only
tell
you
that
the
evidence
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
nothing
more
inextricably
bound
up
in
a
salesman's
mind
and
in
common
usage
and
practice
than
replacing
stale
gum.
because
you're
not...
look,
if
you
go
to
a
retail
store,
and
you're
selling
$10
worth
of
gum,
that's
not
going
to
do
anything
for
you.
but
if
he's
a
regular--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--certainly.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
will
submit
to
you
that
it
is
not
delivery,
that's...
that
it's
an
exchange.
and
what
the
statute
contemplates
is
a
delivery
order
sent
for
approval
outside
the
state.
and
that's
not
this.
that
order
has
been
sent
from
outside
the
state.
it's
in
the
store.
that
has
been
completed.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
that's
funny.
i
don't
look
at
it
that
way
because
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
statute
is
talking
about
when
it
means
delivery.
i
think
this
is
a
simple
exchange
for
gum
which
has
been
delivered,
and
he's
going
to
get
further
deliveries
in
the
future.
and
all
he's
doing
is
he's
taking
a
gum
which
is
really
no
longer
what
the
man
bargained
for,
what
he
paid
for,
and
just
saying,
we'll
give
you
what
you
originally
paid
for
and
what
was
originally
delivered
to
you.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
strongly
urge
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
which
as
i
think
justice
blackmun
pointed
out,
was
an
unanimous
view,
and
which
ordinarily
you
would
not
expect
from
the
taxing
state,
be
affirmed
in
this
case.
thank
you.
