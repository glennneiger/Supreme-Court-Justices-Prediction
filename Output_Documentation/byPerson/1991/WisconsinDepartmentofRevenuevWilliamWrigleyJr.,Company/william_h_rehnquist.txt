argument
now
in
no.
91-119,
the
wisconsin
department
of
revenue
v.
william
wrigley,
jr.,
co.--
mr.
creeron,
is
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
creeron,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
creeron,
i
think
wrigley's
in
their
brief
say
that
even
you,
your
side,
the
state,
doesn't
insist
that
it
be
only
solicitation,
only
would
you
like
to
buy,
period.
that
even
you
concede
there
may
be
some
incidental
conversation
and
so
forth
in
connection
with
that.
they
say
you
don't
really
limit
it
to
the
actual
narrowest
meaning
you
could,
either.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
restocking
the
gum
at
the...
you
know,
at
the
same
call
would
you
ask
him
to
buy
some
more?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
surely
solicitation
includes
not
just
the
first
time
you
approach
the
company,
but
approaches
thereafter
to
keep
their
sales
going?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
if
you're
back
the
third
time,
and
the
customer
said
i've
really
got
these
complaints
about
the
first
two
batches
that
i
bought,
forward
them
to
the
manufacturer,
the
salesman
cannot
do
that
without
going
beyond
solicitation
in
your
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
creeron.
mr.
prettyman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
it's
an
overstatement,
mr.
prettyman,
to
say
it
doesn't
take
power
away
from
states
to
tax.
because
in
the
absence
of
this
statute,
don't
you
think
that
wisconsin
would
have
a
better
case
for
taxing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
who
was
billed
for
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
prettyman.
mr.
creeron,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
creeron.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-119,
wisconsin
department
of
revenue
versus
william
wrigley,
jr.,
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
