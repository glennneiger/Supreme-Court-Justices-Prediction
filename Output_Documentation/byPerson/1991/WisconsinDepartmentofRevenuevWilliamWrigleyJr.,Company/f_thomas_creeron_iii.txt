mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
for
the
6-year
period
at
issue
the
respondent
engaged
in
activities
other
than
those
expressly
permitted
by
public
law
86-272,
thereby
forfeiting
the
limited
immunity
from
state
taxation
measured
by
income,
which
is
accorded
by
that
statute.
it
is
wisconsin's
position
that
the
respondent
did
engage
in
activities
other
than
those
expressly
permitted,
that
its
assessment
covering
that
period
is
valid,
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
should
therefore
be
reversed.
this
case
arose
as
a
result
of
a
franchise
tax
assessment
made
by
the
wisconsin
department
of
revenue
against
the
william
wrigley,
jr.,
company,
which
is
the
largest
manufacturer
of
chewing
gum
in
the
world.
the
franchise
tax
is
a
fairly
apportioned
tax
imposed
only
upon
income
attributable
to
business
activities
within
wisconsin.
during
these
years,
wrigley's
wisconsin
sales
ranged
from
$2.8
million
to
$4.4
million,
while
its
total
sales
ranged
from
$140
million
to
$230
million.
the
tax
itself,
exclusive
of
interest,
is
slightly
in
excess
of
$120,000,
an
amount
which
is
not
in
dispute.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
reversed
the
wisconsin
tax
appeals
commission
solely
on
the
legal
question
of
how
it
construed
the
provisions
of
public
law
86-272,
and
agreed
with
the
construction
of
that
statute
that
wrigley
continues
to
advocate
here.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
yes,
it
was.
this
court's
decision
in
heublein
established
two
firm
tenets
for
construing
public
law
86-272.
first,
congress
must
speak
clearly
when
it
chooses
to
abridge
the
state's
taxing
powers,
which
of
course
are
fundamental
to
their
very
existence.
if
congress
does
not
speak
clearly,
ambiguous
terms
in
the
statute
will
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
preexisting
authority
to
tax.
second,
clarity
that
would
remove
uncertainty
was
congress'
primary
goal
in
enacting
public
law
86-272.
while
any
of
the
activities
listed
by
the
wisconsin
tax
appeals
commission
would
probably
be
sufficient
to
support
taxation
under
the
principles
set
forth
by
the
court
in
heublein,
the
major
activities
engaged
in
by
wrigley,
which
we
claim
exceeded
those
listed
in
the
statute,
are
maintaining
stocks
of
goods
in
rented
warehouse
space
in
wisconsin
and
in
its
employees'
homes
in
wisconsin;
replacing
stale
or
damaged
product
from
that
stock
of
goods;
direct
agency
stock
check
sales
and
direct
delivery
of
product
from
that
stock
of
goods;
and
personnel
management
and
similar
activities
engaged
in
by
wrigley's
resident
regional
manager,
which
did
not
involve
any
customer
participation.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
i
do
not
know.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
the
statute
at
issue
is
a
minimum
activity
statute.
it
was
enacted
to
assure
continued
entry
by
small
businesses
into
new
markets
so
that
they
could
compete
with
large,
multistate
corporations
like
wrigley
that
had
already
established
themselves
in
those
markets.
under
the
statute,
a
seller
of
tangible
personal
property
is
permitted
to
engage
in
three
activities
if
they
originate
outside
the
taxing
state.
it
may
approve
orders,
it
may
fill
orders,
and
it
may
deliver
goods
to
the
customer.
wrigley
shipped
fresh
gum,
carried
on
its
books
as
inventory,
to
a
warehouse
and
to
its
employees'
homes
in
wisconsin.
that
gum
was
not
shipped
to
the
customer,
and
most
of
it
remained
in
storage
at
these
locations.
once
that
gum
was
in
wisconsin,
it
is
our
position
that
it
became
a
stock
of
goods
within
the
state.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
the
only
shipment
of
goods
other
than
to
the
customer
was
to
the
warehouse
and
to
its
employees'
homes,
yes.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
yes,
but
that
instance
continued
through
all
six
of
the
tax
years
at
issue.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
no,
it
was...
they
rented
warehouse
space,
but
gum
isn't,
and
the
space
was
not--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--excuse
me?
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
i
do
not
know
how
large
the
space
was,
but
i
believe
the
record
indicates
that
during
this
time
period
the
annual
cost
was
no
more
than
$300
a
month.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
yes,
the
record
clearly
reflects
that
the
regional
manager
in
1973
obtained
permission
from
wrigley
to
rent
the
warehouse,
and
was
assured
by
wrigley
that
he
would
in
fact
be
reimbursed
for
those
warehouse
costs.
then
when
an
employee
was
finally
hired
and
the...
he
lived
in
an
apartment,
the
stock
of
gum
would
not
fit
within
his
apartment,
he
continued
that
arrangement,
and
he
also
was
assured
by
wrigley
that
he
would
be
reimbursed
for
those
costs.
so
i
don't
think
wrigley
can
say
that
it
did
not
approve
of
this
particular
activity.
once
the
gum
was
in
these
in-state
locations,
wrigley's
sales
representatives
would
use
that
gum,
travel
around
to
dealer
locations,
and
would
fill
display
stands
at
the
retailer's
location.
if
the
retailer
did
not
have
the
correct
sizes
of
product,
the
sales
representative
would
swap
product
with
the
retailer,
and
place
the
different
sizes
of
product
in
the
display
stand.
it's
our
position
that
that
activity
constituted
delivery
of
goods
from
within
the
state.
on
occasion,
approximately
once
per
month
per
sales
representatives,
the
retailer
would
not
have
the
correct
size
of
product,
the
sales
representative
could
not
do
the
necessary
product
swapping,
and
the
sales
representative
would
then
provide
gum
to
the
retailer
through
a
device
known
as
an
agency
stock
check.
the
way
that
would
work
was
that
the
stock
check
would
be
given
to
the
retailer
as
a
receipt,
the
wholesaler
would
bill
the
retailer,
and
wrigley
would
then
bill
the
wholesaler.
since
billing
did
occur
in
these
situations,
it's
our
position
that
a
sale
did
take
place.
therefore,
both
approval
and
delivery
of
these
agency
stock
check
transactions
occurred
in
wisconsin.
the
plain
and
unambiguous
meaning
of
the
statutory
terminology
prohibits
this
product
swapping
and
these
agency
stock
check
transactions.
the
statute
does
permit
certain
business
activity
within
a
state
that
would
otherwise
have
jurisdiction
to
tax,
but
its
language
immediately
limits
the
phrase
"business
activity"
in
such
a
way
that
the
only
activity
of
that
kind
that
may
originate
within
the
state
must
constitute
solicitation
of
orders.
the
plain
and
unambiguous
meaning
of
the
term
"only"
is
that
nothing
else
may
occur.
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
decision,
with
which
wrigley
appears
to
agree
in
every
respect,
holds
that
the
ordinary
and
accepted
meaning
of
the
term
"solicit"
is
to
make
a
plea.
the
ordinary
and
accepted
meaning
of
the
term
"solicitation
of
orders"
therefore,
is
simply
requesting
orders.
even
if
solicitation
were
determined
to
be
an
ambiguous
term,
its
possible
meanings
can
be
placed
on
a
spectrum.
at
one
end,
simply
requesting
and
receiving
orders
within
the
state
would
be
permissible,
and
any
other
activity
would
result
in
payment
of
a
fairly
apportioned
tax.
at
the
other
end
of
that
spectrum,
lease
or
ownership
of
physical
facilities
or
the
presence
of
a
stock
of
goods
would
be
prohibited,
and
every
other
activity
conducted
within
a
state
which
would
otherwise
have
jurisdiction
to
tax,
would
nevertheless
be
tax
exempt.
every
presumption
in
heublein
is
in
favor
of
that
end
of
the
spectrum,
where
only
requesting
orders
is
permissible.
under
the
court's
decision
in
that
case,
wrigley's
burden
to
establish
that
the
court
should
move
away
from
that
end
of
the
spectrum
any
distance
at
all
is
enormous.
yet
wrigley's
redefinition
of
the
term
"solicitation"
to
include
what
it
claims
are
incidental
activities
is
at
the
exact
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
from
its
ordinary
and
accepted
meaning.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
we,
the
wisconsin
department
of
revenue,
did
not
apply
the
narrowest
test
that
is
applied
in
some
states,
but
it
is
our
position
that
the
activity
must
be
part
and
parcel
of
the
sales
pitch.
that
may
be
slight...
a
slightly
different
definition
than
saying
that
all
you
can
do
is
ask
for
the
order,
but--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--it's
our
position
that
you
can't
do
that.
that
serves
another
purpose.
it
serves
a
quality
control
purpose
of
the
company,
which
is
other
than
solicitation.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
well,
the
statute,
first
of
all,
only
protects
the
sale
of
tangible
personal
property.
it
does
not
protect
the
provision
of
services.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
not
at
all.
we
take
the
position
that
if
the
activity
is
part
and
parcel
of,
inextricably
bound,
whatever
terminology
along
those
lines
you
chose
to
use,
part
of
the
sales
pitch
itself,
that
the
activity
is
permissible.
the
pre-sale/post-sale
test,
i
think,
is
useful
in
regard
to
the
replacement
of
damaged
goods
because
i
think
what
that
test
is
trying
to
get
at
is
that
you
can't
do
more
simply
because
the
first
sale
or
many
sales
have
taken
place.
the
first
time
you
approach
a
customer
who
had
never
done
business
with
you
before,
you
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
replace
damaged
goods,
which
i
think
indicates
that
that
activity
is
something
that
is
beyond
the
sales
pitch
itself.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
i
don't
believe
that
activity
does
come
within
our
definition.
i
don't
believe
complaint
handling
is
something
that
would
occur
the
first
time
that
you
approach
the
customer.
so
that
activity
does
not
fit
within
our
definition.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
yes.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
absolutely.
you
can
do
the
same
things
the
second
time,
the
third
time.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
again,
it's
our
position
that's
a
quality
control
service,
and
that
that
is...
that
is
not
part
and
parcel
of
the
sales
pitch.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
we
absolutely
do
not
recognize
any
de
minimis
exception.
we
feel
that
that's
inconsistent
with
the
word
"only"
that
congress
used
in
this
particular
statute.
and
if
you
look
in
the
legislative
history,
senator
byrd,
the
sponsor
of
the
bill,
in
the
congressional
record
at
16355
says
that
the
sale
of
a
single
sample
within
the
state
would
result
in
a
forfeiture
of
immunity
under
the
bill.
it
seems
that
if
you're
going
to
apply
that
logic
to
warehouse
rental,
the
rental
of
a
single
warehouse
or
a
small
amount
of
warehouse
space
would
also
result
in
a
forfeiture
of
immunity
under
the
statute.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
he
may
have
been,
but
if
we
look
simply
to
the
unambiguous
language
itself--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--excuse
me?
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
well.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
the
plain
an
unambiguous
meaning
of
the
term
"only"
means
that,
and
it's
our
position,
anyway,
that
congress
did
not
want
a
de
minimis
exception
with
respect
to
this
particular
statute.
you
do
have
in
various
aspects
of
the
law
de
minimis
exemptions
created,
but
i
have
not
seen
one
with
respect
to
a
taxing
statute
that
uses
the
word
"only".
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
perhaps
that's
all
the
more
reason--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--why
this
statute
should
not
be
construed
to
have
de
minimis
exemption.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
if
he
gives
the...
a
prospective
customer
samples,
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
would
be
permissible
because
it
has
no
other
purpose
other
than
solicitation
of
orders.
if
you
rent
a
warehouse
for
a
bunch
of
samples--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--well,
first
of
all,
that's
not
what
happened
here.
i
mean,
most
of
this
gum
was
used
to
replace
product.
but
the--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--replace
stale
product.
very
little
of
it
was
used
as
free
samples.
but
the
act
of
renting
the
warehouse
itself,
it's
our
position,
would
not
be
solicitation.
you
cannot
have
rental
of
a
warehouse
full
of
samples.
and
if
you
look
at
the
bills
that--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--if
you're
renting
physical
plant
within
a
state,
it's
our
position
that
that
is
not
permissible
with
any
unambiguous
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
no,
absolutely
you
can
do
that.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
i
didn't
say
that
you
couldn't
carry
them
in
a
cab.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
i'm
saying
you
can't
put
it
in
a
warehouse,
which
is
what
happened
here.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
you
can
engage
in
the
sales
pitch
itself.
if
by
that
you
mean
that
is
any
activity
which
would
generate
additional
profits
permissible,
we
take
the
position
that
that
activity
is
not
allowed
under
the
unambiguous
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
no,
i
believe
you
can
do
that.
i
don't
see
what
other
purpose
that
activity
would
have,
that
that
activity
would
be
inextricably
bound
up
in
the
sales
pitch
itself.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
if
the
term
"solicitation"
is
determined
to...
is
given
its
ordinary
and
accepted
meaning,
then
i
believe
that
would
be
permissible.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
i
don't...
again,
i
don't
think
you
can
do
that.
the
bills
that
were...
that
did
not
pass
indicated
that
if
you
had
warehouse
space
or
anything
of
that
nature
within
the
state,
that
those
activities
were
not
permissible.
so
the
act
of--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--the
cab's
okay.
[laughter]
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
probably
an
unlikely
scenario,
but
transportation
to
and
from
the
customer
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
solicitation.
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
we
take
the
position
that
you
can't
even
drive
away
from
the
customer
in
your
automobile,
that
you
have
to
walk
home,
and
that's
absolutely
not
true.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
well,
i
don't
know
if
i
would
look
at
it
in
those
terms.
if
there
is
a
problem
with
advertising,
it
would
be,
i
think,
that
the
statute
only
allows
solicitation
of
the
customer
and
the
customer's
customer.
and
advertising
might
be
construed
as
what
would
be
called
third-tier
solicitation
where
you're
soliciting--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--that
is
a
problem.
you...
your
first
question,
i
assumed,
just
asked
about
is
advertising
solicitation,
not
whether
advertising
was
permitted
under
this
particular
statute.
apparently
i
misunderstood
your
first
question.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
well,
if
the
ad
does
in
fact
involve
third-tier
solicitation,
which
is...
i
take
it
your
question
assumes
that,
then...
i
mean,
you
can't
do
it
simply
because
the
customer
imposes
it
as
a
condition.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
again,
with
advertising
you
have
a
difficult
problem.
we're
not
relying
on
the
advertising
that
occurred
in
this
case.
but
it
depends,
i
think,
under
the
statute,
on
what
audience
you're
reaching.
if
you're
reaching
the
customer
or
the
customer's
customer,
you
can
do
it.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
right.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
well,
you
see
in
this
case,
the
problem
with
that
is,
and
why
advertising
really
is
a
difficult
issue
here
and
why
we're
not
relying
on
it,
is
in
this
case
some
retailers
were
wrigley's
customers.
so
you're
reaching
a
mixed
audience
with
the
advertising.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
i
believe
section
(e)(2),
which
refers
to
missionary
activities,
does
permit
solicitation
of
the
customer's
customer.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
well,
that...
that's
the
next
case.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
jurisdiction
to
tax--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--jurisdiction
to
tax
is
present
is
this
case.
we're
not
claiming
and
it's
not
an
issue
in
this
case
that
advertising
itself
creates
jurisdiction
to
tax.
the
question
is
if
there
is
otherwise
jurisdiction
to
tax,
what
activities
are
exempt
solicitation?
in
conclusion,
it's
our
position
that
the
wisconsin...
the--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--it's
our
position
that
it's
an
all
or
nothing
statute.
once
you
engage
in
activities
beyond
those
expressly
permitted
by
the
statute,
you're
taxable
for
the
whole
tax
year.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
i'm
not
aware
of
any
court
which
has
taken
a
contrary
position
and
required
some
kind
of
a
percentage
apportionment
based
on
what
activities
are
solicitation
and
what
are
not.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
well,
some
courts
have
accepted
the
de
minimis
argument,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--as
far
as
i
know,
there's
no
court
that's
held
to
the
contrary.
in
conclusion,
we
urge
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
on
the
de
minimis
exemption,
the
word
"only"
is
what
gives
the
statute
its
character
protecting
small
business.
if
you
make
$600
of
sales,
and
you
say
that's
de
minimis,
a
small
business
who
comes
into
the
state
and
makes
that
same
$600
of
sales,
and
it's
their
total
sales,
loses
out
under
the
statute.
that's
totally
at
odds
with
the
statutory
purpose
of
protecting
small
business.
the
de
minimis
exemption
also
hasn't
been
defined
in
any
way--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--well,
even
if--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--but
how
do
you
determine
what
the
de
minimis
exemption
is?
i
mean,
they
have
no
definition--
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
--but
i
mean,
a
small
business
couldn't
claim
a
de
minimis
exemption
if
all
its
$600
of
sales
involve
direct
delivery.
you
know
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
that
removes
the
character
of
the
statute
of
protecting
small
business.
also,
the
statute
was
designed
to
protect
those
corporations
that
couldn't
afford
attorneys
and
accountants
to
examine
the
tax
laws
of
other
states.
i
think
there's
a
certain
irony
in
this
case,
if
you
just
look
at
the
front
of
wrigley's
brief,
that
they're
claiming
the
benefit
of
the
statute
in
light
of
the
great
number
of
able
counsel
that
they're
able
to
employ.
mr.
f.
thomas
creeron,
iii
thank
you
very
much.
