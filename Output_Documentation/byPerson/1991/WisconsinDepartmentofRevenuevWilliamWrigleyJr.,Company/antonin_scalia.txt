justice
scalia
when
you
say
they
did,
i
thought
it
was
one
salesman
did,
right?
do
we
know
that
other
officers
of
the
company
knew
about
that?
justice
scalia
mr.
creeron,
suppose
you
have
a
salesman
who
makes
his
presentation
to
the
customer,
the
customer
buys
some
gum,
and
then
the
customer
says,
but
i'm
telling
you
now,
i'm
not
going
to
place
another
order
unless
you
forward
to
the
company
and
support
these
complaints
that
i
have
about
the
company...
about
the
last
shipment.
now
i
want
you
do
that
for
me.
and
he
says,
okay,
i'll
do
it.
and
he
does
it.
he
writes
to
the
company
and
supports
the
customer's
complaints.
is
that
activity...
i
don't
see
how
that
comes
within
your
definition.
that
would
render
the
company
liable?
justice
scalia
meaning
that
it
renders
the
company
taxable?
justice
scalia
maybe
senator
byrd
was
wrong.
justice
scalia
xxx
byrd.
justice
scalia
senator
byrd.
but
all
that
the
statute
says
that
only
these
activities.
and
whenever
you
have
a
de
minimis
exception
from
anything,
it's
a
de
minimis
exception
from
some
categorical
prescription,
otherwise
you
wouldn't
need
a
de
minimis
exception.
you'd
have
a
regular
exception.
justice
scalia
so
all
you
say
is
this
is
categorical.
but
every
prescription
is
categorical
and
you
have
de
minimis
exceptions
from
all
prescriptions,
or
almost
all,
anyway.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
another
taxing
statute
that
uses
the
word
"only",
do
you?
justice
scalia
xxx
then.
justice
scalia
can
you
pay
a
taxicab
to
carry
these
samples?
i
mean,
let's
say
a
taxicab
charges
for
suitcases,
and
you
put
the
samples
of
suitcases
in
the
trunk
of
the
cab
to
show
it.
that's
out,
too?
justice
scalia
well,
why
can
you
do
it?
why
is
that
any
different
from
storing
the
samples?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
everything
that
you
would
reasonably
be
expected
to
do
with
samples
ought
to
be
okay
if
the
samples...
if
giving
the
samples
are
okay.
otherwise,
that's
silliness.
you
say,
well,
you
can
give
him
samples,
but
you
can't
carry
it
in
a
cab.
justice
scalia
i
know
you
didn't,
but
you
ought
to
if
you're
going
to
say
you
can't
put
it
in
a
locker.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
if
you
just
have
them
driven
around
constantly
you'll
be
all
right.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
what's
a
customer's
customer?
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
wholesalers
or
retailers,
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
scalia
but
not
the
consumer.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you
concede
customer's
customer.
i
would
think
the
line
would
end
at
customer.
justice
scalia
before
you
get
to
the
warehouse,
what
is
the
relationship
that
renders
something
de
minimis
or
not?
you
gave
a
very
tiny
percentage
of
wrigley's
total
sales--
justice
scalia
--of
their
total
sales
in
wisconsin?
justice
scalia
you
think
that's
the
way
to
decide
it?
justice
scalia
this
is
gum
that
has
not
gone
stale
on
the
retailer's
shelf.
it
is
gum
that
is
stale
when
delivered
to
the
retailer?
justice
scalia
and
he
doesn't
pay
for
this
new
gum?
justice
scalia
so
he
only
pays
for
the
gum
that
he
either
sells,
or
that
stays
perpetually
fresh?
justice
scalia
it
was
his
wife.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
that's
one
of
the
things
that
troubles
me.
i
can't
believe
that
congress
enacted
a
statute
that
would
be
almost
impossible
of
application,
and
i'm
looking
for
a
criterion
that
would
be
readily
applicable.
and
maybe
the
categorical
solicitation
test
is
easier
than
what
you're
proposing.
the
state
authorities,
under
your
test,
would
really
have
to
know
each
individual
industry.
if
servicing
normally
goes
along
with
solicitation
for
this
industry,
it's
okay.
if
it
doesn't
normally
go
along
with
solicitation
for
that
industry,
although
it
does
for
another
one,
then
it's
not
okay.
that
makes
life
very
complicated.
why
should
we
buy
in
to
that
kind
of
difficulty?
justice
scalia
but
it
says
that.
i
mean,
it
goes
to
the
trouble
of
saying
that.
and
this
doesn't
say
what's
considered
solicitation
in
the
industry,
it
says
solicitation,
as
though
that's
something
everybody
understands
and
it's
the
same
everywhere.
justice
scalia
i'm
trying
to
be.
justice
scalia
well,
that
would
make
me
think
that
maybe
carrying
your
samples
around
in
the
taxicab,
yes,
is
part
of
solicitation,
but
i
don't
know
why
replacing
stale
gum
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
between
1973
and
1978
the
respondent,
william
wrigley,
jr.,
company,
a
chicago-based
corporation,
sold
chewing
gum
in
wisconsin
through
a
sales
force
consisting
of
a
regional
manager
and
various
field
representatives,
all
of
whom
engaged
in
various
activities
in
addition
to
just
requesting
orders
from
customers.
wisconsin
orders
were
sent
to
chicago
for
acceptance
and
were
filled
by
shipment
through
common
carrier
from
outside
of
wisconsin.
in
1980,
the
petitioner
here,
wisconsin
department
of
revenue,
concluded
that
wrigley's
in-state
business
activities
during
the
years
in
question
had
been
sufficient
to
support
wisconsin's
imposition
of
a
franchise
tax
on
the
corporation.
wrigley
maintained
that
it
was
immune
from
the
tax
under
section
381(a)
of
title
15
of
the
united
states
code.
that
section
prohibits
a
state
from
taxing
the
income
of
a
corporation
whose
only
business
activities
within
the
state
consist
of
"solicitation
of
orders"
for
tangible
goods.
provided
that
the
orders
are
sent
outside
the
state
for
approval
and
the
goods
are
delivered
from
out
of
state.
ultimately,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
disallowed
the
tax.
obviously,
the
statutory
phrase,
"solicitation
of
orders",
includes
any
speech
or
conduct
that
explicitly
or
implicitly
proposes
a
sale.
we
think
it
must
mean
more
than
that,
however.
if
the
statute
is
not
to
be
rendered
a
practical
nullity,
solicitation
must
also
cover
the
entire
process
associated
with
inviting
an
order.
on
the
other
hand,
the
statutory
phrase
should
not
be
interpreted
so
broadly
as
to
include
all
activities
that
are
routinely
or
even
closely
associated
with
solicitation
or
customarily
performed
by
salesmen.
in
our
view,
solicitation
of
orders
as
used
in
section
381(a)
covers
those
activities
that
are
entirely
ancillary
to
requests
for
purchases,
that
is,
those
activities
that
serve
no
independent
business
function
apart
from
their
connection
to
the
soliciting
of
orders.
those
activities
that
the
company
would
have
reason
to
engage
in
any
way
but
simply
chooses
to
allocate
to
its
in-state
sales
force
are
not
covered.
we
also
conclude
that
there
is
a
de
minimis
exception
to
the
activities
that
forfeit
the
statutory
immunity,
the
legal
maxim
de
minimis
non
curat
lex,
the
law
does
not
take
account
of
trifles.
whether
a
particular
activity
is
sufficiently
de
minimis
to
avoid
the
loss
of
the
statutory
immunity
depends
upon
whether
that
activity
establishes
a
non-trivial
additional
connection
to
the
state.
applying
these
standards,
we
conclude
that
wrigley's
wisconsin
business
activities
were
not
limited
to
the
solicitation
of
orders.
the
sales
representative's
practice
of
replacing
stale
gum,
for
example,
served
an
independent
business
function
since
wrigley
would
need
to
take
care
of
spoiled
goods
even
if
it
did
not
have
a
sales
force.
similarly,
the
representative's
occasional
sales
to
retailers
who
had
agreed
to
install
new
display
racks
obviously
served
the
independent
purpose
of
earning
a
profit
on
those
items.
and
because
the
vast
majority
of
the
gum
stored
by
wrigley
in
wisconsin
was
used
in
connection
with
these
activities,
that
storage
and
the
indirect
rental
of
space
for
that
storage
was
in
no
sense
ancillary
to
solicitation.
moreover,
these
non-immune
activities
when
considered
all
together
are
not
de
minimis.
accordingly,
we
conclude
that
wrigley
was
not
entitled
to
tax
immunity
under
the
statute
and
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
blackmun
join.
