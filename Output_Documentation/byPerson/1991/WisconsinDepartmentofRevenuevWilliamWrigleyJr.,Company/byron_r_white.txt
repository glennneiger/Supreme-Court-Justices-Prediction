justice
white
what
if
the
salesman
is
seeking
new
customers,
and
he
wants
some
samples.
here
is
some
great
wrigley
gum,
why
don't
you
try
it
out
for
a
week,
see
if
you
can
sell
it.
so
he
gives
him
a
few
samples
hoping
that
he'll
get
an
order
next
week.
and
he
does.
the
guys
says,
gee,
pretty
good
gum,
sells
well.
and
he...
if
he
has
to
have
samples
at
his
house
or
in
a
warehouse,
is
that
too
much?
justice
white
well,
you
got
to
put
them
somewhere,
and
your
wife
doesn't
like
them
in
your
house.
[laughter]
so
what
are
you
going
to
do?
you
go
to
some
locker
somewhere.
now
are
you
out
of
bounds
then?
justice
white
it's
what?
it's
used
to--
justice
white
--well,
you
can
have
a
locker
2
feet
square.
justice
white
but
the
cab's
okay?
justice
white
all
right.
so
he
can't
do
that
and
stay
within
the
statute.
justice
white
all
right.
well,
you're
the
attorney
general.
well,
what
if
wrigley
simply
advertises
over
wgm
and
wb...
are
those
television
stations
as
well
as
railroad...
as
well
as
radio
stations
in
chicago?
well,
whatever
the
corresponding
television
stations
are
in
chicago,
and
those
are
beamed
into
wisconsin.
does
that
render
him...
does
that
render
wrigley
liable?
justice
white
well,
if
the
advertising...
if
just
advertising
in
the
state
from
out
of
state
would
give
you
jurisdiction
to
tax,
why
you
would
just
be
home
free
and
so
would
every
other
state
because
there...
national
advertising.
justice
white
xxx.
[laughter]
justice
white
not
if
you
lose
this
one.
[laughter]
justice
white
how
did
you
check
credit?
justice
white
didn't
you
even
check
credit?
justice
white
you
mean
they
did
it
on
the
phone
to
wisconsin?
justice
white
so
they
corresponded
or
used
the
telephone
to
check
the
credit.
justice
white
into
wisconsin.
justice
white
well,
i
know
but
what
would
illinois...
how
would
illinois
check
the
credit?
justice
white
well,
i
assume
they
communicated
with
somebody.
justice
white
well,
you
mean
they
just
sat
in
illinois
and
said,
gee,
here's
this
name,
and
it
must
be
good?
[laughter]
justice
white
they
must
have
written
into
wisconsin.
justice
white
yes,
i
know.
[laughter]
justice
white
all
right.
go
ahead.
justice
white
xxx
wasn't
gum.
suppose
it's
a
very
expensive
piece
of
machinery,
and
all
you
do...
the
only
thing
you
do
besides
solicitation,
and
you're
going
to
claim
that
it's
solicitation,
is
that
you
service
that
engine.
he
calls
you
up
and
says
this
engine
won't...
isn't
running.
and
so
you
rush
out
there.
you
have
a
mechanic
or
the
same
salesman,
he's
a
serviceman,
and
he
goes
out
and
services
the
engine.
that's
part
of
his
regular
duties.
why?
he'll
never
get
another
order
from
that
company
if
he
doesn't
service
that
engine.
now,
do...
is
that
in
the
same
category?
justice
white
what
point
was
i
making?
[laughter]
i
was
asking
a
question.
justice
white
say
the
salesman
is
a
qualified
technician
and
he...
part
of
his
duties
is
regularly
answering
customers
whose
engines
won't
run.
justice
white
well,
say
it
is
customary
in
the
industry.
justice
white
you
concede
it's
all
or
nothing?
justice
white
have
you
covered
all
the
four
things
that--
justice
white
--but
you've
covered
the
stale
gum.
justice
white
and
the
warehouse.
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
what
do
you
do
with
the
stale
gum
you
take
off
the
shelf?
throw
it
in
the
wastebasket?
justice
white
it's
really
a
trade,
isn't
it?
justice
white
you
take
it
and
you
replace
it.
that's
a
trade.
justice
white
so
it's
a
trade.
it's
a
trade.
justice
white
so
instead
of
money,
you
give
them
new
gum.
so
it's
sort
of
a
sale.
justice
white
it's
sort
of
a
sale.
but
he's
billed
for
it.
that's
what
he
was
billed
for.
