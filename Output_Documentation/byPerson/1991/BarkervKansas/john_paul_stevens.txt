justice
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
stevens
--of
course,
it's
a
statute
that
gives
consent
to
tax.
it's
not
a
prohibition,
isn't
it?
but
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
your
basic...
one
of
the
differences
in
this
case
is
that
there
is...
at
least
one
or
two
categories
of
federal
retirees
who
are
not
taxed
by
kansas.
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
now,
what
if
kansas,
in
its
retirement
system,
had
several
categories
of
state
employees,
and
didn't
tax...
or
did
tax
two
or
three
of
those
categories.
would
that
eliminate
the
discrimination?
justice
stevens
well,
supposing
the
state
gave
a
tax...
tax-free
retirement
benefits
to
only
10
percent
of
its
retirees,
and
federal
retirees,
90
percent
were
tax-free
under
the
state
but
there
were
10
percent
that
were
taxed.
would
that
10
percent
also
be
entitled
to
the
benefit?
justice
stevens
well,
the
purpose
in
the
state
exemptions
is
to
increase...
encourage
people
to
work
for
the
state.
it's
a
form
of
extra
compensation.
that's
perfectly
clear.
justice
stevens
what
all
that
boils
down
to
is
that
if
they
give
a
tax-free
retirement
benefit
to
any
state
employees,
they
must
give
them
to
all
federal
employees.
that's
your
position,
i
gather.
justice
stevens
because
if
you
examine
it
as
a
whole,
the
federal
employees
are
basically
treated
like
everybody
else
in
kansas.
they're
just
not
treated
like
this
small
group
of
people
who
get
a
special
benefit.
justice
stevens
it
really
doesn't
prohibit
it.
it
just
doesn't
extend
the
consent.
justice
stevens
excuse
me.
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
you
if
you
weren't
through
with
the
point.
i
was
just
wondering,
in
your
view
of
davis
and
the
statute,
supposing
that
kansas
taxed...
did
not
have
tax-free
retirement
benefits
for
its
state
police
and
all
its
law
enforcement
officers.
would
they
then
be
able
to
tax
the
military
retirees?
justice
stevens
say
their
reason
for
doing
it
was
they
wanted
to
treat
all
law
enforcement
and
military
people
alike,
figuring
that
they're
somewhat...
the
most
comparable
state
employees,
and
they
wanted
the
tax.
they
wanted
to
get
this
additional
tax
revenue,
and
then
treat
federal
military
retirees
just
like
other
kansas
citizens.
justice
stevens
so
that
if
they
grant
any
tax-free
retirement
benefits
to
even
a
tiny
fraction
of
their
retired
work
force,
they
must
grant
all
federal
employees
the
tax-free--
justice
stevens
but
of
course,
when
they
were
called
up,
i
suppose
they
got
their
regular
pay,
and
not
just
their
retirement,
for
retired
service.
justice
stevens
it
is
not
given
the
same
exemption
that
other
retirement
pay
is.
