justice
white
the
court
also
construed
a
statute,
didn't
it?
justice
white
and
just
said
that
that
incorporates
the
intergovernmental
rules.
justice
white
so
all
you
need
is
the
statute?
justice
white
well,
it...
i'm
not
sure
whether
that's
in
your
favor
or
not.
justice
white
and
111
has
been
on
the
books
quite
awhile.
justice
white
well,
of
course,
you
aren't
arguing
here...
you
aren't
arguing
to
sustain
that
broad
notion
that
the
states
had.
you
don't
defend
that
in
this
case.
you're
just...
you
just
zero
in
on
the
military
now.
justice
white
and
you're
saying
that...
awhile
ago
you
said
well,
maybe
we're
in
trouble
with
respect
to
other
types
of
government
employees
who
might
be
taxed.
justice
white
well,
i'm
going
back
to
the
cia
example.
you
went
on
to
say
that
except
for
the
military,
which
you
certainly
try
to
justify,
you
might
be
in
trouble
if
you
tried
to
tax
other
kinds
of
government
employees.
justice
white
and
yet
you
say
the
states,
up
until
the
time
of
davis,
thought
that
they
could
tax
all
government
retirees...
united
states
retirees...
including
kansas.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
why
did
they
do
that?
do
you
know?
justice
white
well,
at
least
the
fact
that
you
tax
some
other
classes
of
federal
employees
for
which
you
don't
have
the
military
argument
sort
of
impugns
the
state's
submission
that
you
are
not
taxing
military
just
because
of
the
source.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
first
case
is
barker
against
kansas,
no.
91-611,
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
kansas
supreme
court
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
