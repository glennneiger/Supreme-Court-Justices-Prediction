mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
kansas,
military
retired
pay
is
taxable,
and
state
retirement
benefits
are
not
taxable.
and
it's
our
position
that
this
differential
tax
treatment
is
valid
because
it
satisfies
the
test
set
out
in
davis
v.
michigan.
and
that
test
requires
that
differential
tax
treatment
must
be
directly
related
to
and
justified
by
significant
differences
between
the
two
classes
of
taxpayers.
and
our
position
is,
very
simply,
that
these
two
classes
are
taxed
differently
because
they
are
different.
and
the
primary
justification
for
different
tax
treatment
is
the
fact
that
military
retirees
receive
current
pay
for
current
services;
and
state
retirees
receive
pension
benefits...
they
receive
deferred
compensation
for
prior
services.
the
character
of
the
compensation
received
by
these
two
classes
of
taxpayers
is
fundamentally
different.
and
the
different
tax
treatment
is
based
on
the
nature...
on
the
character
of
the
income.
it
is
not
based
on
the
source
of
the
income.
and
taxation
based
on
the
source
is
the
only
type
of
discrimination
that
the
statute
prohibits.
the
statute
does
not
prohibit
a
state
from
drawing
reasonable
distinctions
in
its
income
tax
structure
where
there's
a
legitimate
reason
for
doing
so.
the
only
prohibition
is
where
it's
discriminatory
because
the
federal
government
is
the
source
of
the
income.
now
there
really
is
no
question
that
this
court
has
characterized
military
retired
pay
as
current
pay
for
current
services.
and
in
mccarty
v.
mccarty,
this
court
stated
that
military
retired
pay
differs
in
some
significant
respects
from
a
typical
pension
and
retirement
plan.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
well--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--first,
i'm
not
sure
that
we
have
any
cia
retirees
in
the
state
of
kansas.
and
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
we
do.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
yes,
the
cia,
that's
secret.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
believe
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
wanted
to
get
to--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--that
question
of
uniforms
in
a
minute.
as
to
the
cia
retirees,
i
believe
you're
correct,
that
they
are
substantially
different.
they're
not
similarly
situated
with
military
retirees,
and
the
same
set
of
justifications
which
would
justify
taxing
the
military
retirees
would
not
necessarily
also
justify
taxing
the
cia
retirees.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
perhaps
we
would.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
or,
your
honor,
perhaps
we
wouldn't.
perhaps
it
is
the
case
that
the
taxation
of
certain
federal
retirees,
other
than
military
retirees,
does
not
measure
up
to
the
davis
standard.
perhaps
the
state,
if
it
had
to,
would
be
unable
to
justify
that
different
tax
treatment.
and
perhaps,
as
to
certain
other
federal
retirees,
the
tax
might
be
unconstitutional.
but
we
don't
believe
that's
the
case
here.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
no,
your
honor.
our
primary
justification
is
the
distinction
between
current
pay
and
deferred
compensation.
and
we--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--we
make
the
point
of
the
continuing
obligations
that
the
military
retirees
owe
to
the
federal
government,
because
that
is
characteristic
of
a
class
of
people
who
are
receiving
current
compensation.
they
have
ongoing
duties
and
responsibilities.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
think
that
is
one
indicia,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
the
current
obligations
are
that
military
retirees
are
not
retired
from
the
military
service.
they
are
placed
on
retired
status.
but
they
remain
in
the
military
service
of
the
united
states.
they
are
not
discharged
from
the
military.
they
are
not
civilians.
they
can
be
recalled
to
active
duty,
and
that's
a
recall
on
an
involuntary
basis.
and
just
last
year
there
were
many
military
retirees
recalled
and
sent
to
the
persian
gulf.
and
they're
subject
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
they're
prohibited
from
engaging
in
certain
employment
and
civilian
occupations.
and
there
was
some
discussion
earlier
that,
consistent
with
their
status
as
employees
of
the
federal
government,
they
are
entitled
to
various
employee
benefits
and
privileges
that,
of
course,
are
not
available
to
members
of
the
general
public.
we
cite
these
things
not
because
they,
alone,
are
significant...
not
the
fact
that
military
retirees
are
authorized
to
wear
their
military
uniforms.
but
they
can
wear
their
uniforms
because
they
have
military
status.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
well,
i
cite
all
those
differences
because
i
do
believe
they
all
go
to
our
ultimate
point:
that
military
retirees
are
receiving
current
compensation,
that
they
are
current
employees.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
well,
the
legislature,
in
drawing
these
distinctions...
and,
of
course,
our
legislature
is
keenly
aware
of
the
military
retirees
and
the
fact
that
their
retirement
pay
is
taxable.
they
have
looked
at
a
broad
range
of
factors.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
on
the
distinction
between
current
pay--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--versus
deferred
compensation?
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
well,
that
has
traditionally
been
a
very
significant
for...
very
significant
difference
for
purposes
of
taxation
on
both
the
federal
and
the
state
level.
taxation
by
its
very
nature
treats
certain
classes
of
income
differently.
it
treats
current
pay
differently.
it
treats
deferred
compensation
differently.
it
treats
capital
gains
differently.
it's
all
income.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
it
is.
i
believe
that's--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--i
believe
it's
correct
that
it
is
earned
on
an
ongoing
basis,
that
it's
not
a
vested
right,
not
an
enforceable
right
to
receive
military
retired
pay.
so
as
long
as
you
fulfill
the
conditions
of
your
retirement,
you
are
able
to
receive
military
retirement
pay.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
think
there
are
very
narrow
restrictions.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
that
point,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
i
could
agree
with.
at
least
i'm
not
aware.
the
only
exception
i
know
of
is
that
if
a
person
retires
from
working
for
the
state
government
and
is
receiving
their
retirement
benefits,
and
then
elects
to
become
re-employed
by
the
state,
there
is
a
limit
on
the
amount
of
their
retirement
benefits
they
can
receive.
that
is
the
only
instance
that
i'm
aware
of.
the
military
retirement
system
has
always
been
regarded
as
unique.
and
that
is
not
simply
just
our
contention.
that
is
clearly
the
petition
of...
the
position
of
the
federal
government.
and
on
page
15
of
our
brief,
we
quote
from
a
1987
report
by
the
united
states
department
of
defense.
and
there
they
say
that
while
there
may
be
a
superficial
resemblance
between
the
military
retirement
system
and
retirement
systems
that
exist
in
the
private
sector,
there
are,
in
fact,
substantial
differences
between
the
military
retirement
system
and
all
other
retirement
systems.
i'd--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--the
retired
state
employees
have
a
vested
right
to
receive
their
retirement.
and
i
think
there's
very
narrow
limits
on
the
extent
to
which
the
state
can
discontinue
or
modify
their
right
to
receive
their
retirement
benefits.
i
think
your
honor
is
correct
in
citing
that
proposition--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--again,
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
that
that
is
the
case.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
would
like
to
focus,
for
a
moment,
on
the
davis
case.
and
in
davis,
the
state
of
michigan
taxed
federal
civil
service
retirement
benefits,
but
it
did
not
tax
state
retirement
benefits.
and
the
court
recognized
that
there
was
different
tax
treatment
here.
and
if
you'd
like
to
call
it
discriminatory
tax
treatment,
we
can
call
it
that.
but
the
court
conducted
an
inquiry
to
determine
if
this
different
tax
treatment
was
justified.
and
i
think
this
demonstrates
first
it
is
not
just
the
mere
fact
of
discrimination,
not
the
fact
that
federal
retirees
receive
less
favorable
treatment
than
retired
state
employees.
that
is
not
conclusive.
and
the
court
proceeded
to
conduct
this
inquiry,
and
searched
for
significant
differences
between
the
two
classes.
now,
in
davis,
it
happened
that
the
court
found
no
such
differences,
and
the
conclusion
therefore
was
that
since
there
were
no
differences
between
the
two
classes
themselves,
no
intrinsic
differences,
the
taxation
must
be
based
on
some
other
factor,
some
outside
factor.
and,
of
course,
in
davis,
the
federal
civil
service
retirees
receive
their
pay
from
the
federal
government,
and
the
state
retirees
were
paid
by
the
state.
so
that
was
determined
to
be
a
tax
that
distinguished
based
on
the
source.
and
that
is
why,
i
believe,
the
conclusion
was
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
statute.
because
it
discriminated
based
on
the
source.
now,
there
were
many
states
just
like
michigan
that
taxed
federal
civil
service
retirement
benefits,
but
did
not
tax
state
retirement
benefits.
but
kansas
was
not
one
of
those
states.
kansas
did
not
have
to
go
back
and
modify
its
income
tax
act
to
conform
with
the
davis
decision.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
mention
a
point
that
was
raised
earlier,
as
to
what
would
be
the
effect
upon
the
state
if
the
law
was
struck
down,
and
retroactively...
retroactive
relief
was
required.
that
would
be
approximately
$91
million
that
we
would
be
required
to
refund
to
the
federal
military
retirees.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
that
covers
the
tax
year
1988
and
all
years
forward,
together
with
interest
calculated
at
the
statutory
rate
on
the
tax
refunds.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
your
honor,
did
i
say
1988?
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
well,
what
i
meant
to
say
was
from
tax
year
1984
and
all
years
forward.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
that
is
the...
earliest
year
under
our
statute
of
limitations
that
the
taxpayers
could
claim
income
tax
refunds.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
your
honor,
this
matter
has
been
certified
as
a
class
action.
and
the
class
embraces--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--all
military
retirees
in
the
state.
so
we
would
regard
them--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--as
covered
by
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
that
is
not
a
requirement.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
think
the
point,
your
honor,
this
case
is,
of
course,
derived
from
the
davis
case.
and
davis
was
a
case
of
first
impression.
but
there
has
been
considerable
controversy
over
what
was
the
effect
of
this
court's
decision
in
davis.
does
it
have
retroactive
or
prospective
effect?
that
is
of
great
concern
to
the
states
that
have
this
issue.
now--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--it
was,
your
honor.
but
mr.
fowler
stated
earlier
that
that
statute
is
regarded
as
co-extensive
with
the
constitutional
doctrine.
so
the
two
seem
to
go
hand
in
hand.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
say
what
i
believe
is
the
case.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
it
has,
your
honor,
over
50
years.
if
there
is
any
great
unfairness
here...
and,
of
course,
this
is
speaking
to
remedial
issues
which
is
not
presented
in
this
case,
but,
of
course,
hang
over
it
like
a
black
cloud.
davis,
to
the
states,
was
just
like
a
bolt
out
of
the
blue.
states
had
always
believed
that
they
could
engage
in
this
practice
of
exempting
their
own
retirees
and
taxing
federal
retirees,
just
as
they
taxed
all
other
retirees
from
private
sector
retirement
and
other
ordinary
income
in
the
state.
and
it
was--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--i
think
the
states
operated
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
nothing
impermissible
about
them
according
some
favorable
tax
treatment
to
its
own
employees
and
retirees.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
several
classes
of
federal
retirees
who
we
do
not
tax.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
believe
that's
true,
your
honor.
and
i
mentioned
earlier
that
we
do
not
necessarily
contend
that
the
justifications
for
taxing
the
military
retirees
would
also
justify
taxing
other
retirees.
but
that--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--while
exempting...
while
exempting
their
own
retirees?
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
your
honor,
kansas
was
not
directly
affected
by
the
davis
decision
because
kansas
does
not
tax
federal
civil
service
retirees,
and
it
hasn't
taxed
them
for
more
than
30
years.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
correct,
correct.
at
the
time
the
kansas
legislature
created
the
kansas
public
employees
retirement
system,
they
provided
that
the
benefits
paid
from
that
system
would
be
exempt
from
state
income
tax.
and
in
that
same
legislative
session,
they
also
enacted
an
exemption
for
federal
civil
service
retirement
benefits.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
can't
tell
you
precisely,
your
honor.
but
we
would
contend
that
it
certainly
is
evidence
of
an
appreciation
that
similarly
situated
state
and
federal
retirees
should
be
treated
equal...
equally.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
correct.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
precisely.
and
that
is
because
military
retirees
are
unique.
they
are
different
than
state
retirees,
and
they
are
different
than
all
other
classes
of
federal
retirees.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
it
certainly
would
make
the
court's
task
much
easier.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
can
see
your
honor's
point.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
kansas,
we
have
three
large
classes
of
federal
retirees:
federal
civil
service
retirees...
there
are
about
20,000
of
them;
railroad
retirees...
and
there's
almost
20,000
of
them;
and
military
retirees...
between
14
and
15,000.
these
other
classes
of
retirees
that
we
discussed
today
and
that
are
mentioned
in
the
briefs,
may
be
classes
of
one,
two,
or
three.
i
know
we
have
one
lady
who's
retired
from
the
federal
foreign
service.
i
know
we
have
less
than
half
a
dozen
retired
federal
judges.
some
of
these
other
classes,
i
don't
know
whether
we
have
any
of
those
people
residing
in
the
state
or
not.
but--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--i
can
see
your
honor's
point.
but
suppose
we
were
called
upon
to
defend
that
position.
what
would
we
do?
we
would
search...
first
for
what
the
legislature
has
done.
we
would
try
to
see
if
there
were
concrete
differences
between
these
two
classes.
for
example,
federal
judges,
as
i
understand
it,
have
a
lifetime
appointment,
and
their
compensation
cannot
be
reduced
at
any
point.
maybe
this
is
a
significant
difference.
maybe
state
judges
are
treated
differently.
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
we
would
look
to
to
see
if
there
were
legitimate
differences
between
the
two
classes.
as
to
these
other
classes
of
federal
retirees,
i'm
saying
that
perhaps
there
are
justifications
which
would
permit
us
to
tax
them
in
the
manner
that
we
do.
and
we
would
look
to
what
they
do,
and
what
is
the
character
of
their
income,
and
how
do
they
compare
with
similarly
situated
state
retirees.
that
is,
we
are
just
simply
applying
the
rationale
and
the
analysis
that
this
court
set
out
in
davis.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
virtually
all
state
and
local
government
retirees
are
all
exempt.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
think
that
comparing
the
facts
in
davis
to
the
facts
of
this
case...
as
i
said,
davis
involved
federal
civil
service
retirees
and
retired
state
employees.
and
those
two
groups
were
both
fully,
and
unconditionally
retired
from
government
service.
they
both
participated
in
contributory
retirement
plans.
they
both
received
deferred
compensation
for
prior
services.
now,
of
course,
those
differences
simply
don't...
those
similarities
simply
don't
exist
in
this
case.
military
retirees
continue
to
remain
in
the
military
service.
state
employees
are
completely
severed
from
employment.
state
retirees
contribute
to
their
retirement
program,
and
they
pay
tax
on
those
contributions.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
mentioned
earlier
that
there
was
quite
a
few
retirees
recalled
to
serve
in
the
persian
gulf.
and,
of
course,
how
often
they
are
recalled--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--there
were
reserves
called
up;
there
were
national
guard
called
up.
there
were
also
military
retirees
called
up.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
believe
the
number
runs
into
the
thousands,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
yes,
they
were
assigned
to
both
foreign
posts
and
posts
here
in
the
united
states.
i'm
looking
right
now
at
a
press
release
that
was
issued
by
the
pentagon.
they
said
retirees
are
needed
to
fill
critical
requirements
as
doctors,
nurses,
linguists,
aviators,
water
purification
specialists.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
point
is
that
particularly
now
that
it
appears
to
be
the
future
policy
of
the
government
to
downsize
the
active-duty
forces,
there
is
going
to
be
an
increasing
reliance
on
reserve
and
retirement
personnel
to
fill
the
need
when
the
need
arises.
at
any
rate
in
davis,
the
state
of
michigan
came
forward
and
tried
to
justify
their
different...
differential
tax
treatment.
and
they
said
that
on
the
average,
federal
civil
service
retirement
benefits
are
higher
than
the
benefits
that
we
pay
to
our
state
retirees.
and
because
of
this
disparity
in
the
amounts,
we
feel
that
there's
a
justification
for
according
this
tax
benefit
to
the
state
retirees,
whereas
we
would
not
give
such
a
benefit
to
the
federal
retirees.
but
this
court
rejected
that
justification
because,
while
it
might
have
been
true
on
the
average...
as
a
general
proposition...
it
certainly
wasn't
true
in
every
instance.
there
were,
of
course,
some
state
retirees
who
had
a
higher
pension
than
the
federal
civil
service
retirees.
and
the
court
said
that
this
justification
is
not
directly
related
to
the
differences.
it
does
not
apply
in
each
instance.
but,
of
course,
the
justifications
that
we
are
putting
forward
today,
do
apply
across
the
board.
an
even-handed
application
of
the
rationale
that
we
advance
for
justifying
different
tax
treatment
results
in
the
taxation
of
all
military
retirees,
but
it
does
not
result
in
the
taxation
of
any
state
retirees.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
your
honor,
out
statutes
do
not
state
that
a
tax
shall
be
imposed
on
military
retirees.
military
retired
pay
is
included
in
federal
adjusted
gross
income,
which
is
the
basis
that
the
tax
is
imposed
at
the
state
level.
so
it's...
it
is
not
singled
out
in
any
statutory
manner.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
it's
not
singled
out
in
the
same
manner
that
there
is
a
specific
provision
that
says
we
are
setting
aside
this
discrete
group
of
taxpayers.
we
are
subjecting
them
to
unusual
tax
burdens
that
do
not
apply,
as
a
general
proposition,
to
other
taxpayers
of
the
state.
i
believe
i
understood
the
solicitor
general
earlier
to
say
that
if
kansas
had
statutory
provision
that
said
deferred
compensation
shall
be
exempt,
and
current
pay
for
current
services
shall
be
taxable,
that
they
would
feel
that
would
pass
muster.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
well,
i
took
his
comments
to
mean
that
if
the
statute
set
out,
in
specific
terms,
a
neutral
classification,
a
neutral
basis
for
different
tax
treatment,
that
that
would
be
permissible.
for
example,
there
are
other
states
that
have
such
provisions.
they
say
benefits
reserved...
received
from
contributory
retirement
programs
shall
be
exempt,
and
noncontributory
retirement
programs
shall
be
taxable.
and,
of
course,
that
is
what
we
have
here
in
kansas.
it's
simply
that
our
statute
is
not
framed
in
that
manner.
and
i
think
the
court
ought
to
look
to
the
practical
effect
of
this
tax,
rather
than
the
form
in
which
the
statutory
language
appears.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
policy
reasons
that
underlie
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
and,
of
course,
the
principle
that
the
federal
government
is
immune
from
certain
state
taxes
does
not
arise
from
the
actual
text
of
the
constitution.
it's
implied
from
the
supremacy
clause.
it's
deemed
to
be
necessary
to
protect
the
operations
of
the
federal
government
from
interference
by
the
state.
and
here,
it
is
not
alleged
that
the
tax
results
in
any...
any
interference
to
any
federal
function.
and,
of
course,
that
is
the
purpose
of
this
constitutional
doctrine.
it
does
not
exist
for
the
benefit
of
individual
taxpayers,
such
as
the
petitioners.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
i
think
the
statute
prohibits
a
tax
that
discriminates
because
the
federal
government
is
the
source
of
the
pay
of
compensation.
and
we
believe
that
that
is
congress'
way
of
prohibiting
a
tax
that
is
trying
to
reach
out
and
interfere
with,
or
hinder,
a
federal
function.
that
if
a
tax
is
using
its
sovereign
taxing
authority
to
interfere
with
federal
operations,
that
that
ought
to
be
permitted.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
that's
what
i
believe
arises
out
of
the
principle
that
they
are
prohibiting
a
tax
that
discriminates
based
on
the
source.
taxes
will
no
be
prohibited
if
it
discriminates
for
any
other
legitimate
basis.
it
is
only
the
source-based
taxation
that
is
prohibited.
now,
this
court
is
not
the
petitioners'
only
source
for
relief.
and
they
can...
ought
to
seek
relief
from
congress
in
the
first
instance.
and
if
congress
actually
perceived
that
its
interests
were
being
threatened
by
this
state
tax,
why,
you'd
think
that
they
would
do
something
about
it.
congress
could
pass
a
law--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--yes,
congress
may,
by
statute--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--yes,
i
did
say
that...
the
current
statute.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
congress--
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
--correct.
mr.
james
a.
d.
bartle
correct.
but,
of
course,
it's
our
position
that
the
tax
does
not
violate
the
current
statutory
provision.
congress
could
always
step
into
this
field
and
extend
federal
tax
immunity
by
statute
beyond
the
limit
that
the
constitution
would
otherwise
establish.
thank
you.
