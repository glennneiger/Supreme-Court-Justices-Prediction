mr.
john
f.
manning
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
level
of
generality
at
which
this
issue
must
be
addressed.
the
statute
prohibits
taxation
that
discriminates
against
an
officer
or
employee
because
of
the
source
of
the
compensation.
in
davis,
this
court
defined
that
test
as
prohibiting
discriminatory
taxation
between
federal
and
state
retirees
unless
there
were
significant
differences
between
the
two
classes
of
taxpayers.
mr.
john
f.
manning
it
does...
by
negative
implication,
i
believe...
in...
this
court,
in
davis
held
that
by
negative
implication
it
also
prohibits
it
and
that
it's
coextensive
with
the
constitutional
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
but
to
return
to
the
question
of
what
a
significant
difference
would
be,
for
purposes
of
davis,
we
believe
that
significance
has
to
be
assessed
in
terms
of
a
legitimate
tax
purpose.
now,
there
are
many
differences
between
federal
and
state
employees.
to
give
one
example,
federal
patent
officers
are
different
from
any
state
or
local
government
employees,
because
unlike
state
and
local
government
employees,
they're
authorized
to
issue
patents.
that
is
a
significant
difference
between
a
federal
employee
and
a
state
and
local
government
employee.
but
it
is
not
a
difference
that
has
any
significance
for
tax
purposes.
and
we
believe
that
this
court
would
invalidate
a
statute
that
taxed
federal
patent
officers
more
heavily
than
state
and
local
government
employees.
mr.
john
f.
manning
we
believe
that
a
neutrally
drawn
classification
that
attempted
to
account
for
double
taxation
by
reference
to
the
manner
of
funding
would
be
a
legitimate
classification
and
would
survive
scrutiny
under
section
111.
however,
that
is
not
that...
the...
what
is
going
on
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
it
is
true
that
no
part
of
the
military
retired
pay
is
taxed
before
it
is
received
because
it
is
not
funded
by
employee...
in
any
part,
by
previous
employee
contributions.
it
is
also
true
that
state
and
local
government
retirement
benefits
are
funded
in
part
through
employee
contributions
that
were
previously
taxed.
but
kansas
also
exempts
that
portion
of
state
and
local
government
retirement
benefits
that
consist
of
employer
contributions
and
accumulated
interest
which,
like
military
retired
pay,
have
never
previously
been
taxed.
now,
we
submit
that
a
nondiscriminatory
tax
truly
intended
to
avoid
double
taxation
would
not
fully
exempt
state
and
local
government
retirement
benefits
based
on
their
source,
but
would
generally
exempt
retirement
benefits
to
the
extent
they
reflect
previously
taxed
contributions.
and
that,
by
the
way,
is
the
way
in
which
the
federal
government
taxes...
benefits
disbursed
pursuant
to
qualified
pension
plans
under
section
72
and
section
402
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
so
there
is
ample
precedent
for
kansas
to
draw
a
classification
in
a
neutral
way
that
accounted
for
the
justification
that
they
cite.
i
would
also
like
to
address
justice
o'connor's
point
about
the
other
federal
cases.
the
legal
conclusion
that
retired
pay
is
current
compensation
in
cases
involving
such
matters
as
bankruptcy
or
laches
does
not
necessarily
govern
the
question
in
the
context
of
section
111
and
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
as
mr.
fowler
pointed
out,
congress,
in
fact,
treats
military
retired
pay
not
as
current
pay
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
but
as
deferred
compensation
in
such
statutes
as
the...
as
fica,
and
in
the
individual
retirement
account
statute.
so
there
is
certainly
a
recognition
in
the
federal
code
that
military
retired
pay
can
have
aspects
of
deferred
compensation.
and
we
believe--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--justice
o'connor,
i'm
not
aware
of
the
exact
number.
i'm
certain
that
there
are
at
least
three
other
states:
arkansas,
missouri,
and
colorado;
and
that
a
number
of
other
states
raised...
that
the
question
is
presented
in
a
number
of
states
because
statutes
were
amended
following
this
court's
decision
in
davis
to
give
exemptions
of
various
degrees
to
federal
retirees.
some
of
them
extended
them
fully
to
civil
servants
and
military
retirees;
some
of
them
extended
them
only
to
civil
servants.
but
prior
to
davis,
a
number
of
states
taxed
both
in
their
refund
claims
pending,
and
in
a
number
of
states--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--there
have
been...
19
states,
i
believe,
have
amended
their
statutes
in
the
aftermath
of
davis
to--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--at
least
three
or
four
have
not
taken
into
account
the
military
retired...
have
not
treated
military
retired
pay
the
way
they
have
treated
federal
civil
servants.
i
believe
there
may
be
more
than
that,
but
i
am
not
aware
of
the
exact
number,
your
honor.
we
submit
that
the
state
mischaracterizes
military
retired
pay
in
substance
when
it
compares
it
to
the
salaries
of
current
state
and
local
government
employees.
we
believe
that
military
retired
pay
is
much
more
like
the
deferred
compensation
that's
received
by
state
retirees.
as
this
court
noted
in
davis,
the
earmarks
of
deferred
compensation
are
receipt
of
benefits
based
upon
past
years
of
service,
and
highest
pay-rank
achieved.
and
that's
precisely
the
system
that's
used
by
the
kansas
retirement
system,
as
well
as
the
federal
military
retirement
system.
but
more--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--i'm...
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
they
would.
it
would
depend,
of
course,
on
the
justification
that
was
proffered
by
the
state
for
granting
the
exemption.
the
davis--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--the
assertion
that
military
retirees
are
most
like
state
and
local
police
would
not
be
sufficient
to
overcome
the
requirements
of
the
quality
that
are
imposed
by
section
111,
which
states
that
the
state
cannot
discriminate
against
federal
employees...
as
extended
to
retirees
in
davis,
or
as
applied
to
retirees
in
davis...
because
of
the
source
of
their
compensation.
we
believe
that
a
conclusion
that
these
are
the
closest
categories
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
that
the
taxation
of
military
retirees
is
not
because
of
the
federal
source
of
their
compensation.
rather,
we
submit
that
the
state
would
have
to
come
up
with
some
substantive
characteristic--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--it
would
depend
on
whether
they
applied
their
classification
in
a
neutral
and
even-handed
way.
it
might
well
be
that
if
kansas
granted
an
exemption
for
schoolteachers
because
they
wanted
to
encourage
people
to
go
and
become
schoolteachers
that
it
might
be
a
valid
justification
if
it
was
applied
even-handedly
to
cover
schoolteachers
on
indian
reservations
or
schoolteachers
who
taught
in
schools
on
military
bases.
as
long
as
the
classification
is
drawn
in
a
neutral
way
and
captures
the
policy
that
the
state
asserts
as
the
basis
for
its
tax,
then
it
doesn't
violate
section
111's
prohibition
against
taxation
because
of
the
source
of
the
federal
compensation.
that
would
be
taxation
that
was
because
of
the
social
policy
of
encouraging
people
to
become
teachers.
now
that's
not
to
say
that
the
state
might
not
draw
a
classification
in
that
sort
of
circumstance
that
would
run
afoul
of
section
111.
for
example,
if
the
state
drew
a
classification
that
was
very
general,
but
that
burdened
only
a
tiny,
tiny
percentage...
an
inconsequential
percentage
of
state
employees,
but
burdened
a
large
number
of
federal
employees,
this
court
might
well
conclude
that
that
was
a
pretext
for
discrimination.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that...
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
the...
we
submit
that
that's
exactly
what
they're
doing
in
this
case
with
military
retirees.
the
state
has
not
indicate
that
there
are
any
tax
consequences
that
flow
from
the
fact
that
military
retirees
are
subject
to
recall
or
must
comply
with
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
all
they
have
asserted
is
that
these
are
characteristics
that
have
substantial
consequences,
it's
true.
but
they
have
not
suggested
that
there's
any
relationship
between
those
consequences
and
any
legitimate
interest
of
the
state
in
tax...
in
taxation,
except
that
they
want
to
get
more
money
from
military
retirees
and
not
from
any
state
or
local
government
retirees.
in
addition,
we
believe
that...
we
believe
that
the
facial
discrimination
is
sufficient
to
invalidate--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--you're
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
they
could
tax
medals,
as
long
as
they
did
it
in
an
even-handed
and
neutral
way,
and
as
long
as
the
burden
that
fell
on
state
employees
as
opposed
to
federal
employees
was
not
so
lopsided
that
it
suggested
that
its
irrationality
was
merely
a
show
for
discrimination.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
