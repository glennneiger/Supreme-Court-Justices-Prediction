justice
kennedy
assuming
the
case
in
which
a
state
made
a
difference
between
contributory
and
noncontributory
plans
for
taxation
or
exemption
of
retirement
benefits,
and
it
just
so
happened
that
federal
employees
were
disadvantaged,
would
that
be
a
legitimate
tax
distinction
in
your
view?
justice
kennedy
so
is
it...
is
it
your
submission
that
under
a
properly
drawn
statute...
and,
of
course,
you
would
say
that
this
is
one...
but
under
a
properly
drawn
statute,
the
state
of
kansas
could
say
if
any
retiree
has
current
obligations
the
payments
received
by
him
are
taxable?
is
that
the
submission
you're
making?
justice
kennedy
so
it's
not
the
obligations;
it's
the
pay?
justice
kennedy
and
so
we
know
whether
or
not
there's
current
versus...
pay
versus
some
other
kind
of
pay
because
they
have
current
obligations
to
perform.
is
that
how
we
know
that
it's
current
pay?
justice
kennedy
and
what
are
those
current
obligations
here?
justice
kennedy
but
what
is
it
that
would
motive
the
decision
to
tax,
versus
to
exempt
on
this
criterion?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
well,
is
the...
is
the
theory
that
it...
in
the
case
of
the
military
officer
it's
earned
for
current
status?
justice
kennedy
is
that
the
theoretical
difference?
justice
kennedy
what
fiscal
period
does
that
cover?
is
it
2
years?
justice
kennedy
and
why
do
you
cut
it
off
at
1988?
because
of
the
state
statute
of
limitations,
or--
justice
kennedy
--yes.
justice
kennedy
'84.
and
why
do
you
cut
it
off
at
1984?
justice
kennedy
that's
singled
out,
i
think.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
don't
think
he
conceded
that.
i
think
he
conceded
they
would
then
look
to
the...
i
think
he
referred
to
the
degree
of
lopsidedness,
to
see
whether
there
was
still
a
whiff
of
the
pretextual
about
it.
so
i
don't
think
he
was
precluding
a
further
substantive
examination.
justice
kennedy
well,
do
you
think
the
statute,
section
111,
requires
some
sort
of
interference
with
the
federal
operations
before
it
can
be
applied?
justice
kennedy
well,
the
statute
certainly
doesn't
contain
that
additional
language.
but
you
say
that
was
congress'
purpose
in
passing
it?
justice
kennedy
would
that
be
under
its
power
to
enforce
sovereign
immunity?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
that...
but
i
thought
you
agreed
that
the
constitution
and
the
statute
here
are
coterminous,
so
far
as...
so
far
as
the
doctrine
of
governmental
immunity
is
concerned.
justice
kennedy
but
if...
but
if
it
fails
under
the
current
statute,
the
congress
would
have
no
constitutional
power
to
do
that.
justice
kennedy
unless
it's
under
some
other
clause.
