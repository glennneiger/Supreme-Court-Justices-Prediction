chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-611,
keyton
barker
and
pauline
barker
v.
kansas.
mr.
fowler,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
don't...
don't
the
military
get
some
benefit?
they
get
to
go
to
the
px
when
they're
retired;
they
get
military
medical
treatment
that
perhaps
federal
retirees,
as
a
class,
don't
get?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
it
does
tend
to
distinguish
the
military
retirees
from
the
federal
government
as
a
whole
retirees
that
were
involved
in
the
davis
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
and
because...
because
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
need
more
than
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
manning,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
manning.
mr.
bartle,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
why
do
all
of
these
factors
you've
just
mentioned...
how
do
they
bear
on
any
sort
of
tax
policy
the
state
might
have?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
have
the
same
problem
as
the
chief
justice.
if
you're
a
tax
policy
planner,
what
is
the
tax
theory
on
which
you
justified
this
differential?
why
is
it
that
the
military
person
who
receives
current
pay...
and
presumably,
therefore,
has
more
burdens...
is
not
exempt
from
the
tax?
chief
justice
rehnquist
davis
wasn't
a
constitutional
case,
really.
it
was
just
interpreting
4
u.s.c.
section
111.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
special
class
as
viewed
by
the
states
was
really
their
own
retirees,
wasn't
it?
everybody
else
was
treated
differently.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
bartle,
as
a
practical
matter,
you
know,
how
often
are
military
retirees
called
up,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
was
that
a
call-up
of
retirees
who
put
in
20
years,
rather
than
national
guard
or
reserves?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many?
chief
justice
rehnquist
throughout
the
country?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bartle.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
