mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
for
decision
in
this
case
is
whether
the
kansas
income
tax
act
violates
controlling
principles
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
by
favoring
retired
employees
of
the
state
and
its
political
subdivisions
over
retired
members
of
the
united
states
armed
forces.
just
three
terms
ago,
in
the
case
of
davis
v.
michigan
department
of
treasury,
this
court
applied
settled
principles
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
to
strike
down
michigan's
differential
income-tax
deduction
scheme
because
it
uniformly
favored
all
retired
state
or
local
government
retirees.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
it
construed
a
statute
which
this
court--
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
--your
honor,
i
believe
in
the
davis
case
the
court
said
that
4
u.s.c.,
section
111
is
coextensive
with,
and
thus
fully
preserves
the
modern
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
your
honor,
perhaps
the
statute
is
sufficient
in
and
of
itself
because
it
plainly
prohibits
discrimination
against
federal
officers
or
employees
because
of
the
federal
source
of
their
pay
or
compensation.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
kansas
supreme
court
has
endorsed
here
under
state
standards
of
review.
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
briefs,
which
i
will
attempt
to
elaborate
on
here,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed,
because
the
kansas
income
tax
structure
plainly
discriminates
in
favor
of
all
retired
employees
of
the
states
and
its
political
subdivisions
over
retired
members
of
the
united
states
armed
forces
in
kansas.
petitioners
represent
a
class
of
approximately
14,000
retired
members
of
the
armed
forces
in
kansas,
and
their
joint
taxpayer
spouses
were
applicable,
who
have
been
subject
to
disparate
income
tax
treatment
by
the
state
of
kansas
from
at
least
tax
year
1984
through
tax
year
1989.
several
named
petitioners
brought
suit
in
1989
challenging
that
disparate
tax
treatment
in
the
wake
of
davis
v.
michigan
department
of
treasury,
on
the
basis
that
the
kansas
income
tax
structure,
on
its
face
and
as
applied,
violates
governing
principles
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
notwithstanding
the
arguments
raised
below,
the
kansas
supreme
court
held
that
differential
tax
treatment
of
military
retirement
income
by
the
state
of
kansas
was
constitutionally
permissible,
because
it
was
directly
related
to
and
justified
by
significant
differences
between
the
classes
of
retirees.
however,
in
route
to
its
decision,
the
kansas
supreme
court
violated
several
cardinal
principles
of
law
that
this
court
has
recognized
since
at
least
1960.
those
principles
are
as
follows.
because
the
federal
government's
interest
must
weigh
in
the
balance
whenever
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
is
at
issue,
the
reviewing
court
must
examine
the
applicable
tax
structure
as
a
whole,
and
must
focus
on
the
nature
of
the
classification
erected
by
statute
to
determine
whether
the
proffered
reasons
for
discrimination
furnish
the
actual
basis
for
differential
treatment,
and
if
so,
whether
those
differences
furnish
an
adequate
justification
for
differential
treatment.
the
kansas
income
tax
structure
utilizes
federal
adjusted
gross
income
as
the
starting
point
for
determining
an
individual
taxpayer's
kansas
taxable
income.
because
federal
adjusted
gross
income
incorporates
and
includes
all
forms
of
retirement
income...
from
whatever
source
derived...
kansas,
one
would
think,
should
uniformly
tax
all
forms
of
nondisability
government
retirement
income.
but
it
does
not.
because
of
a
specific,
statutory
exemption
scheme
adopted
by
the
kansas
legislature
and
in
effect
for
more
than
30
years,
kansas
exempts
from
state
income
taxation
all
retirement
benefits
paid
by
the
state
and
its
political
subdivisions
to
their
respective
retirees.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
kansas
supreme--
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
--your
honor,
those
cases
are
not
wrong
for
what
they
stand
for.
those
cases
did
not
involve
taxation,
they
did
not
involve
discrimination
against
federal
military
retirees,
and
they
did
not
involve
4
u.s.c.
section
111
or
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
for
tax
purposes,
military
retired
pay
is
substantially
analogous
to
all
other
forms
of
pension
or
annuity
income.
and
that
is
a
point
that
has
been
expressly
recognized
by
congress.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
your
honor--
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
--your
honor,
there
are
differences
between
retired
members
of
the
military
and
other
forms
of
government
retirees.
the
differences
should
be
recognized
only
if
they
are
significant,
and
only
if
they
are
directly
related
to
the
particular
purpose
and
classification
at
issue.
in
this
case,
kansas
does
not
draw
distinctions
based
upon
the
characterization
of
retired
income...
retirement
income
as
either
deferred
compensation
or
current
compensation.
the
tax
structure
does
not
draw
that
classification.
the
purpose
for
the
exemptions
for
state
and
local
government
retirement
income
is
unquestionably
to
extend
the
value
of
that
state
and
local
retirement
income,
while
reducing
and
minimizing
the
state's
employment
costs.
and
that,
of
course,
is
a
purpose
that
this
court
recognized
clearly
in...
davis
as
being
illegitimate.
now--
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
--your
honor,
under
the
general
rule
applicable
in
civil
cases,
i
believe
this
court
has
recognized,
we
would
assume
that
it
would
be
retroactive
at
least
for
the
parties
before
the
court.
that
issue,
however,
is
not
expressly
presented
by
this
case.
but
moreover,
we
would
submit
that
there
is--
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
--your
honor,
in
our
judgment,
there
is
no
retroactivity
question
presented
by
this
case
for
the
simple
reason
that
reversal
of
the
decision
below
simply
requires
application
of
4
u.s.c.
section
111.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
well,
your
honor,
that
would
suit
just
fine
with
me.
[laughter]
but
there
is
no
retroactivity
issue
in
this
case.
because
reversal
of
the
judgment
below
simply
requires
application
of
section
111
of
title
4
of
the
united
states
code.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
we
believe
it
should
be
given
back.
but
as
this
court
has
recognized
previously,
the
remedial
issues
involved
in
this
case,
which
have
not
yet
been
passed
upon
by
the
kansas
supreme
court,
are
typically
left
to
the
state
courts
to
pass
on
in
the
first
instance.
but
back
to
my
other
point,
there
is
no
retroactivity
question
in
this
case
simply
because
it
requires
application
of
a
statute,
which
this
court,
just
three
terms
ago,
described
as
having
unmistakable
language
and
meaning,
which
has
been
on
the
books
for
more
than
50
years.
in
order
to
hold
that
a
decision
in
this
case
is
not
retroactive,
would
in
effect
suspend
the
effective
date
of
a
controlling
federal
statute
which
has
been
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
since
1939.
and
i
think
fleming
v.
fleming
certainly
supports
the
proposition
that
that
is
something
that
would
be
inappropriate
to
do.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
now
if
this
were
an
ambiguous
statute,
perhaps
the
conclusion
might
be
different.
but
this
is
a
plain
and
unambiguous
statute.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
it
wouldn't
eliminate
the
discrimination,
your
honor.
in
fact,
that
was
precisely
the
case
in
phillips
chemical
company
v.
dumas
independent
school
district,
where
the
state
of
texas
imposed
a
discriminatory
tax
which
generally
provided
benefits
to
lessees
of
state
and
local
property,
but
there
were
some
lessees
of
state
and
local
properties
that
didn't
get
the
same
benefits
and
were
subject
to
the
same
tax
treatment
as
the
united
states
lessees.
the
court
simply
stated
in
passing
that
that
may
reduce
the
extent
of
the
discrimination;
it
obviously
does
not
eliminate
it.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
would
depend
upon
the
purpose
behind
the
exemptions,
and
the
classification
as
it's
drawn.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
your
honor,
the
court
recognized
in
davis
that
simply
relying
upon
that
legitimate
state
purpose
is
not
a
basis
for
discrimination.
because
it
says
nothing
about
differences
between
the
classes.
it
needs
to
be
kept
in
mind
that
in
dealing
with
intergovernmental
tax
immunity,
that
sovereign
federal
interest
must
be
weighed
in
the
balance.
and
the
only
way
that
that
can
be
accomplished
is
if
the
discriminatory
classification
is
truly
intended
to
account
for
significant
differences
between
the
classes,
and
it
furthers
a
legitimate
state
interest
which
does
not
trench
upon
the
prerogatives
of
the
national
government.
now,
if
that--
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
--we're
not
suggesting
that,
your
honor.
but
certainly,
if
the...
if
preferential
treatment
is
being
given...
especially
to
all
state
and
local
retirees...
but
if
it
is
given
to
state
and
local
retirees,
one
must
look
to
the
purpose
for
it
and
how
the
classification
is
drawn
in
order
to
properly
evaluate
it.
and
that's
all
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
here.
because
the
kansas
supreme
court
failed
to
examine
the
applicable
tax
structure,
as
a
whole,
and
it
failed
to
focus
on
the
nature
of
the
statutory
classification.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
well,
your
honor,
this
small
group
of
people
that
get
a
special
benefit,
as
this
court
recognized
in
davis,
because
they
are
in
privity
with
the
state,
the
danger
that
a
state
is
violating
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
is
greatest
in
this
case.
once
a
decision
has
been
made
to
discriminate
by
giving
exemptions
to
a
favored
class
of
state
and
local
government
employees,
there
is
no
political
check
in
the
system
to
turn
back
the
clock.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
simple.
in
order
to
provide
the
check,
to
provide
equal
treatment
which
is
mandated
under
the
nondiscrimination
clause
of
section
111,
that
would
either
require
an
exemption
for
similarly
situated
federal
retirees,
which
would
reduce
tax
revenue;
or,
if
the
tax
were
applied
uniformly,
as
this
court
recognized
in
davis,
in
order
to
provide
state
and
local
retirees
with
the
same
level
of
benefits,
benefits
would
have
to
be
increased
in
fact
beyond
the
level
of
that
necessary
by
a
tax
exemption.
which
means
once
the
decision
to
discriminate
has
been
made,
there
is
no
political
check
because
there
are
political,
economic,
and
institutional
forces
against
changing
the
status
quo.
because
any
way
they
turn,
they
are
going
to
be
losing
revenue.
and
it
may
result
in
a
tax
increase
across
the
board.
and
the
vast
majority
of
voters
in
the
state
will
not
stand
for
that,
which
is
why
we
are
here
in
court.
because
military
retirees
in
kansas
have
been
fighting
for
equal
treatment
in
the
legislature
for
over
20
years.
they
haven't
gotten
it.
and
we
are
now
asking
this
court
to
provide
them
with
equal
treatment,
because
they
are
substantially
analogous
to
every
state
and
local
government
retiree
for
all
material
purposes.
military
retirees
must
serve
for
at
least
20
years
in
the
armed
forces
before
they
are
eligible
for
retirement.
they
must
meet
statutory
criteria
before
they
are
eligible
for
retirement;
when
members
of
the
military
retire,
they
lose
their
entitlement
to
active
duty
pay
and
allowances
and
instead
receive
retired
pay.
that
retired
pay
is
calculated
based
upon
past
years
of
service.
it's
calculated
in
accordance
with
their
highest
rank
of
paid
rate
held.
while
in
retirement...
retired
members
of
the
armed
forces
are
not
required
to
perform
any
active,
service,
or
affirmative
duties
to
receive
military
retired
pay.
for
these
reasons,
it
isn't
surprising
that
under
the
internal
revenue
code
congress
has
determined
that
these
military
retired
folks
are
entitled
to
the
same
tax
treatment
as
all
other
government
retirees.
they're
given
equal
treatment
by
congress,
and
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
congress
has
expressly
determined
that
there
are
no
substantial
grounds
for
distinguishing
the
tax
treatment
of
the
plan
for
the
uniformed
services
from
these
other
plans.
the
states
are
not
given
the
power
or
the
authority
to
override
or
veto
that
authoritative
determination.
there
are
no
significant
differences.
there
is
no
justification
for
disparate
treatment.
if
there
are
no--
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
those
types
of
benefits,
which
are
also
available
to
members
of
the
military
on
active
duty,
are
expressly
exempt
from
taxation
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
since
the
state
of
kansas
has
adopted
the
piggy-back
approach,
those
allowances
or
special
entitlements
don't
qualify
as
income
to
a
retired
person.
but
it
would
seem
to
me,
your
honor,
that
if
congress
has
decided
to
provide
retired
members
of
the
military
who
have
provided
honorable
service
to
the
united
states
for
20
years
or
more
with
access
to
medical
services,
so
that
they
might
remain
fit
in
retirement,
with
access
to
px
or
commissary
privileges,
it's
not
a
proper
domestic
concern
of
the
state
that
the
federal
government
has
elected
to
provide
these
additional
services
to
them.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
your
honor,
there
may
be
distinguishing
features.
we're
not
denying
that.
but
they
must
be
relevant
for
tax
purposes.
military
retirees
can
wear
uniforms,
too.
and
although
the
state
of
kansas
is
suggesting
that
that's
another
reason
that
they
can
tax
them,
it
must
be
relevant
to
some
legitimate
aspect
of
tax
policy.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
your
honor,
perhaps
i
misspoke.
part
of
the
state's
argument
in
this
case
is
not
that
they
can
tax
retired
members
of
the
military
because
they...
well,
they're
saying
precisely
that
they
can
impose
an
income
tax
on
retired
members
of
the
military
in
part
because
they
can
wear
a
uniform
in
retirement.
they're
not
suggesting
that
they
can
tax
the
uniforms...
and
perhaps
they
could
tax
the
uniforms.
but
certainly
the
fact
that
they
can
wear
uniforms
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
be
a
legitimate
justification
for
taxing
the
income
received
by
those
members
of
our
retirement...
retired
community.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
your
honor--
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
--that
may
or
may
not
be
true,
your
honor,
because
kansas
has
not
drawn
that
distinction.
but
even
if
they
were
to
do
so,
under
the
davis
and
phillips
test,
it
still
becomes
necessary...
even
if
one
concludes
that
a
direct
relationship
exists...
whether
that
is
constitutionally
permissible
under
the
second
prong
of
the
test,
which
is
the
ultimate
standard
of
justification.
and
in
the
event
that
congress
has
foreclosed
a
state
from
relying
upon
a
particular
justification
because
it
doesn't
hinge
upon
a
proper
domestic
concern
and
it
trenches
upon
the
prerogatives
of
congress,
then
certainly
further
inquiry
would
be
required.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
the
court
has
noted
in
the
past,
equal
protection
analysis
is
not
necessarily
controlling
here,
because
federal
sovereign
interests
must
be
weighed
in
the
balance.
if
there
are
no--
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
--because
of
4
u.s.c.
section
111.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
and
the
modern
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity,
the
heart
of
which
is
nondiscrimination.
mr.
kevin
m.
fowler
your
honor,
perhaps
we
don't
need
more
than
the
statute.
we
would
like
some
relief
either
under
the
constitutional
doctrine,
or
its
statutory
embodiment
in
4
u.s.c.
section
111.
if
the
court
chooses
to
give
us
relief
under
one,
rather
than
the
other,
we
will
be
just
as
happy.
thank
you.
