justice
scalia
well,
you
don't
think
it's
bad
that
if
these
retirees'
money
has
been
taken
from
them
unconstitutionally
it
should
be
given
back.
you're...
you're
not
apologizing
for
that,
are
you?
justice
scalia
i
must
say
it's
hard
to
say
what's
relevant
to
a
legitimate
aspect
of
tax
policy.
i
assume
it
would
be
constitutional
to
impose
a
tax
on
uniforms.
i
mean,
i
suppose
you
could...
a
state
could...
you
know,
we're
going
to...
any
uniform,
nurses
uniform,
soldier's
uniform.
justice
scalia
--that's
your...
that's
your
patent
officer
example.
that's
why
that
was
bad,
really,
because
they
picked
out
a
category
that
just
doesn't
exist
except
at
the
federal
level.
justice
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
you
wouldn't
mind
that
if
there
were
a
sufficient
number
of
state
people
who
were
also
irrationally
burdened
in
that
way.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
is
a
rational
tax.
if
they...
if
they
want
to
choose...
if
they
want
to
tax
medals
they
can
tax
medals,
i
presume,
so
long
as...
so
long
as
it
doesn't
seem
targeted
at
the
federal
government.
justice
scalia
but
what
indication
is
there
that
that's
the
distinction
that
the
state
was
drawing?
the
state
also
taxes
retired
pay
of
cia
employees,
i
gather.
justice
scalia
and
they
are
not
in
the
same
position
that
military
retirees
are,
subject
to
recall.
justice
scalia
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
scalia
yes,
that's
right.
[laughter]
good
point,
good
point.
if
you
had
any--
if
you
had
any,
they
would
be
taxed,
wouldn't
they?
justice
scalia
yes,
now
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
distinction
you're
justifying
the
tax
on
the
military
retirees
by.
i
mean,
i
suppose
you
could
also
say
military
retirees
have
brown
uniforms
or,
you
know...
it's
a
distinction,
but
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that's
the
distinction
that
the
state
was
using
in
creating
the
tax
code.
justice
scalia
good.
justice
scalia
but
you'd
have
another
one
for
them,
right?
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
well,
you
can
say
that
about
some
of
your
state
employees
who
are
disabled.
don't
you
have
restrictions
on
certain
activities
of
state
employees
after
they
leave
state
service?
justice
scalia
well,
whatever
they
are,
if
they
violate
those
restrictions
they
can
be
deprived
of
their
retirement
income.
and
yet
you
do
not
tax
that
retirement
income.
justice
scalia
here's
one
of
the
examples
i
was
thinking
of.
if
a
state
employee...
this
is
from
the
government's
brief...
has
participated
in
contracting
with
any
person
or
business
within
the
employee's
last
2
years
of
public
employment,
the
employee
may
not
accept
a
job
with
that
person
or
business
for
a
year
after
the
employee's
public
service
terminates.
that's
a
restriction
under
the
kansas
statutes.
and
if
he
violates
that,
i
gather
that
the
retirement
pay
can
be...
can
be
terminated
or
withheld.
justice
scalia
well,
i
must
say...
in
fairness
to
you...
the
government
puts
it
in
a
footnote
with
a
lot
of
other
things
where...
the
kind
of
things
that
you
mention,
if
a
state
employee
goes
back
to
work
for
the
state
he
would
forfeit
it.
this
is
also
cited
in
the
same
footnote.
but
i
don't
see
a
citation
to
the
statute
that
says
one
of
the
consequences
of
violating
that
1-year
prohibition
is
that
you
lose
your
retirement
pay.
it's
the
implication,
but
i
don't
see
the
statute
cited.
justice
scalia
you
may
be
right.
justice
scalia
i
don't...
most
of
the
times
when
we
have
objections
to
retroactivity
we're
talking
about
a
change
in
the
law.
we
wouldn't
be...
in
finding
against
you...
we
wouldn't
be
reversing
any
decision
of
cours,
would
we?
i
mean,
as
far
as
i
know,
this
is
a...
this
is
a
new
issue.
what
is
the
great
unfairness
in
finding
a
new
issue
against
you?
and
you
say
gee,
i
have
to
pay
back
the
money
i
wrongly
took.
i
mean,
that
always
happens,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
i
know.
but
a
lot
of
other
states
did.
justice
scalia
what
is
the
explanation
for
that,
if
it's
not
too
indelicate
to
inquire?
you
exempt
the
retirement
of
state
judges,
but
not
the
retirement
of
federal
judges.
[laughter]
it
seems
like
a
very
bad
idea.
justice
scalia
now,
would
you
refresh
my
recollection?
are
there
some
classes
of
state
employees,
state
retirees
that
you
do
tax?
justice
scalia
they're
all
exempt.
okay.
justice
scalia
is
there
any
indication
of
that
rationale
in
the
history
of
this
statute...
i
mean,
in
the
legislative
debates
or
anything
else?
what
i'm
worried
about
is,
it
seems
to
me,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
it's
just
an
invented
justification.
had
the
kansas
statute
said
a
tax
shall
be
imposed...
despite
the
exemption
for
everybody
else,
shall
be
imposed
upon
all
retirees
who
have
an
obligation
to
return
to
their
former
employee's
service
upon
call.
then
i
think
you...
you
know,
i'd
feel
quite
differently
about
this
statute.
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
just
says
a
tax
shall
be
imposed
on
military
retirees.
and
then
you
come
in
and
say
well,
this
is
why
they
are
different.
but
do
we
know
that
that's
why
the
state
made
the
distinction?
