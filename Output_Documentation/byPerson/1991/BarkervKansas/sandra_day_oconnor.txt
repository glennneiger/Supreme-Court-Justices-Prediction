justice
o'connor
well,
did
kansas
rely
on
some
federal
cases
that
hold
that
military
retirement
benefits
are
not
deferred
compensation,
but
instead
are
reduced
pay
for
current
services?
justice
o'connor
are
those
cases
wrong?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
answer
to
the
question
almost
depends
on
the
lens
with
which
you're
viewing
it.
at
what
level
of
generality
do
we
answer
the
question
that
you
raise?
there
are
differences.
justice
o'connor
when
do
we
recognize
them
and
when
don't
we?
justice
o'connor
now
if
you
win
here,
the
holding
presumably
would
be
retroactive?
justice
o'connor
well,
it's
certainly
lurking
there.
what
do
you
suppose
we're
calking
about,
looking
at
all
50
states
here?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
didn't
the
jim
beam
opinion
indicate
that
if
we
don't
say
anything
about
it,
then
it
is
generally
retroactive?
justice
o'connor
so
you're
saying
don't
say
anything
about
it.
and
isn't
that
the
consequence?
justice
o'connor
how
many
other
states
have
a
plan
like
kansas
that
singles
out
retired
military?
justice
o'connor
but
there've
been
amendments
in
some
of
those
states
since
davis?
justice
o'connor
and
three
or
four
that
have
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
bartle,
there
are,
though,
some
other
classifications
of
federal
retired
people
who
are
subject
to
the
kansas
tax,
in
addition
to
the
military
retirees.
justice
o'connor
and
as
to
those
other
classifications,
kansas
does
not
have
and
does
not
purport
to
rely
on
the
differences
that
it's
trying
to
articulate
with
regard
to
military.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
problem
is,
we
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
classes
of
federal
employees,
i
suppose,
that
kansas
says
we
can
tax,
and
try
to
figure
out
if
there's
some
legitimate
state
policy
being
implemented.
and
so
it
would
clearly
be
easier
to
do
if
the
reasons
extended
across
the
board
to
all
the
classes
that
kansas
purports
to
tax.
