do
you
really
want
to
rest
on
the
question
of
what
is
a
legitimate
justification
as
opposed
to
what
is
a
generally
applicable
distinction
within
the
tax
structure?
justice
souter
if
kansas
generally
drew
a
distinction
between
the
taxation
of
deferred
income
and
reduced
income
for
reduced
services
you
wouldn't
be
here,
would
you?
justice
souter
so
you're
saying
we
can't
avoid
the
substantive
inquiry,
even
though
we
would
in
a
first-tier
equal
protection
case?
justice
souter
you
mean
anyone
can
come
forward
now...
not
merely
the
parties
to
this
case...
but
anyone
can
come
forward
now
and
still
file
a
timely
claim
as
to
1984?

justice

i
take
it
kansas
does
not
have
a
requirement
to
pay
under
protest,
or
to
raise
a
protest
in
payment
in
order
to
go
after
a
refund
later?
