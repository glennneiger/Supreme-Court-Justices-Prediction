justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
petitioner,
as
the
chief
justice
has
indicated,
is
a
georgia
county.
it
has
an
ordinance
that
requires
permits
for
public
demonstrations
and
declares
that
the
cost
of
protecting
participants
exceeds
the
normal
cost
of
law
enforcement
and
therefore,
every
permit
applicant
is
required
to
pay
a
fee
up
to
$1,000.
it
empowers
the
county
administrator
to
adjust
the
amount
of
that
fee.
the
respondent,
nationalist
movement,
proposed
to
demonstrate
an
opposition
to
the
federal
holiday
to
martin
luther
king,
jr.
but
the
county
attempted
to
impose
its
fee.
the
respondent
filed
suit
claiming
that
the
ordinance
violated
the
free
speech
guarantees
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
district
court
denied
relief
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held
that
an
ordinance
which
charges
more
than
a
nominal
fee
for
using
a
public
forum
for
a
public
issue
speech
is
facially
unconstitutional.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment
and
hold
that
the
ordinance
is
facially
invalid.
government
may
impose
a
permit
requirement
if
it
does
not
delegate
overly
broad
licensing
discretion
to
an
official
and
if
it
is
not
based
on
the
content
of
the
message.
here,
the
decision
how
much
to
charge
or
whether
to
charge
at
all
is
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
administrator
who
is
not
required
to
rely
on
objective
standards.
the
ordinance,
we
feel,
is
content-based
and
neither
the
$1,000
cap
nor
some
lower
nominal
cap
could
save
the
ordinance.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
justice
white,
justice
scalia,
and
justice
thomas.
