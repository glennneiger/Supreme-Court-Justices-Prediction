justice
scalia
forsyth,
very
good.
justice
scalia
mr.
stubbs,
that
goes
a
little
far,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
can
the
county
charge
me
for
jumping
up
on
a
soapbox
and
just
all
by
myself
giving
a
speech,
not
causing
any
interference
with
traffic,
not
requiring
any
policeman?
justice
scalia
i
know
your
ordinance
wouldn't,
but
your
principle
would
allow
the
county
to
charge
me
for
that,
it's
the
county's
property
after
all.
do
you
think
the
fifth
amendment
would
allow
you
to
charge
for
that?
justice
scalia
but
that
is
the
principle
you
were
arguing.
you
were
arguing
property
rights
it
seems
to
me,
that
just
on
the
basis
that
it
owns
the
property,
the
state,
despite
the
first
amendment,
can
charge.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
right.
justice
scalia
wait
a
minute.
in
the
poll
tax
cases
were
you
allowed
to
charge
poll
taxes
to
rich
people
but
not
to
poor
people?
is
that
how
we
defined
those
cases?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
why
isn't
the
same
here,
you
are
either
entitled
to
charge
or
you
are
not
entitled
to
charge.
if
you
are
entitled
to
charge,
you
can
charge
rich
and
poor
alike.
justice
scalia
that's
right,
you
are
agreeing
with
me,
then.
justice
scalia
you
don't
have
to
make
this
exception,
you
have
just
chosen
to
make
this
exception
between
the
rich
and
the
poor?
justice
scalia
we
are
not
talking
about
free
speech...
we
are
talking
about
only
parades,
right?
do
they
have
to
do
a
parade?
can't
they
stand
out
on
the
street
and
deliver
their
message?
justice
scalia
mr.
stubbs,
am
i
correct
that
you
not
only
did
not
charge
for
the
police
protection
which
you
were
authorized
to
charge
for,
but
you
didn't
even
charge
the
full
amount
of
the
administrative
costs?
justice
scalia
you
reduced
what
it
might
have
been.
justice
scalia
that
is
very
generous
of
him.
i
mean,
can
he
pick
which
organizations
he
decides
to
be
generous
with?
i
mean,
would
he
have
been
as
generous
if
this
were
a
communist
party
demonstration
or
some
other
group?
what
kind
of
an
ordinance
is
that,
anyway?
justice
scalia
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
i
should
think
you
have
to
charge
all
groups
on
some
fixed
basis
and
not...
you
make
the
point
in
your
brief
as
though
it
is
a
point
in
your
favor
that
you
didn't
charge
the
full
amount
that
could
have
been
charged.
i
don't
take
it
as
a
point
in
your
favor.
it
is
one
of
the
things
i
worry
about
with
this
ordinance,
that
it
allows
people
to
scale
the
fees
as
they
wish.
justice
scalia
once
again,
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
it
were
just,
or
would
you,
if
it
were
just
an
individual
who
wants
to
stop
passers-by.
he
is
not
parading.
he
just
wants
to
speak
on
the
sidewalk.
justice
scalia
i
am
not
talking
about
your
ordinance.
i
am
talking
about,
would
you
make
the
statement
that
you
just
made,
that
it
is
just
like
charging
for
an
airplane
ticket,
we
can
charge
him
for
the
sidewalk?
justice
scalia
i
see,
and
is
that
the
case
with
radio
time
too?
you
can't
charge
for
it
if
it
is
not
costing
you
anything?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
suppose
i
have
all
this
empty
radio
time,
with
cable
channels
i
suppose
there
is
a
lot
of
dead
time,
if
it
doesn't
cost
you
anything
you
can't
charge
for
it?
justice
scalia
and
you
think
streets
are
the
same?
justice
scalia
do
you
make
charges
for
bike
races,
either
a
marathon
or
a
bike
race
in
town--
justice
scalia
--you
do,
under
a
different
ordinance?
justice
scalia
under
this
ordinance?
justice
scalia
i
thought
it
just
applied
to
parades,
processions
or
open
air
public
meetings.
justice
scalia
you
consider
a
bike
race
a
parade
or
a
procession?
justice
scalia
wow.
justice
scalia
were
they
allowed
to
charge
poll
taxes
to
the
rich?
justice
scalia
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
know--
justice
scalia
--no,
i
mean
afterwards.
justice
scalia
so
once
again,
as
justice
kennedy
says,
it
doesn't
support
your
poor
argument.
what
supports
your
poor
argument?
justice
scalia
right,
and
if
it
could
have
paid
the
fee,
you
would
have
no
problem.
justice
scalia
then
why
don't
you
talk
about
your
problem
instead
of
raising
this
poverty
thing
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
case,
does
it?
justice
scalia
especially
since
there
is
a
waiver
for
poverty
in
the
ordinance.
justice
scalia
sure.
justice
scalia
but
newspapers
don't
impose
a
burden
on
a
little
town
or
a
little
county.
your
group
wants
to
come
in
and
stage
a
march
that
is
going
to
impose
enormous
expenses
upon
the
citizens
of
this
little
town.
i
don't
see
any
relationship
at
all
to
a
stamp
tax,
a
tax
for
documents
that
aren't
causing
any
burden.
this
little
county
is
simply
trying
to
not
be
burdened
by
your
organization
who
wants
to
stage
a
parade.
now
you
are
welcome
to
stage
a
parade
they
say,
but
it
is
going
to
cost
us
some
money
and
since
it
is
your
parade,
you
ought
to
pay
for
it.
it
seems
reasonable
to
me.
justice
scalia
there
were
no
expenses
involved
in
the
stamp
act.
they
are
not
charging
you
an
arbitrary
fee.
they
are
saying
your
causing
us
a
good
deal
of
expense
for
your
parade.
i
suppose
they
could
give
you
the
option
of
perhaps...
would
that
satisfy
you
if
they
say
you
can
waive
police
protection?
justice
scalia
is
that
the
only
thing
wrong
with
this
statute,
that
it
doesn't
permit
you
to
waive
police
protection?
justice
scalia
this
is
a
little
tiny
county,
they
have
one
policeman,
and
you
want
to
bring
in
10,000
people
to
march.
what
are
they
supposed
to
do,
hire
a
police
force
for
you?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean,
no
more
than
they
would--
justice
scalia
--i
don't
see
anything
in
the
constitution
that
says
that
reasonable
costs
cannot
be
assessed
against
people,
just
like
the
radio.
if
you
want
to
use
it,
you
have
to
pay
for
it.
justice
scalia
we
are
not
talking
about
a
fee.
we
are
talking
about
covering
the
expenses
that
you
produce.
justice
scalia
and
you
don't
think
that
the
monetary
limit
stops
that
problem?
justice
scalia
i
still
don't
quite
understand
why
the
$1,000
limit
does
not
apply.
you
say
the
$1,000
limit
is
not
applicable?
justice
scalia
why
is
it
not
a
cap?
justice
scalia
they
had
nothing
to
do
hecklers.
you
are
talking
about
the
heckler's
veto.
justice
scalia
you
say
the
more
hecklers
you
have,
the
more
police
there
will
have
to
be,
so
the
fee
could
be
enormous.
but
there
is
a
$1,000
limit
on
the
police
charges,
isn't
there?
justice
scalia
what
did
you
say
then?
justice
scalia
but
not
for
hecklers.
justice
scalia
so
your
heckler's
fee
argument
is
gone.
justice
scalia
hecklers
produce
toilets?
justice
scalia
i
assume
that
the
rule,
your
no
charge
allowed,
it
doesn't
just
apply
to
political
groups
such
as
yours,
i
suppose
it
would
apply
to
entertainment,
if
you
wanted
to
have
an
open
air
rock
concert,
i
suppose
you
couldn't
charge.
justice
scalia
you
just
made
it.
justice
scalia
we
just
have
to
hope
that
it
isn't
our
little
town
that
they
pick
on
to
have
the
next
big
rock
concert.
justice
scalia
but
you
wouldn't
apply...
you
wouldn't
acknowledge
the
permit
requirement
anyway.
how
can
you
get
a
permit
if
you
not
willing
to
give
me
your
name?
you
say
you
don't
have
to
give
anybody
your
name.
who
do
they
make
the
permit
out
to?
justice
scalia
but
that
is
part
of
your
first
amendment
argument,
you
can't
ask
anybody
his
name.
justice
scalia
but
the
facial
challenge
to
the
statute
is
it
is
invalid
because
it
would
require
somebody
to
give
a
name
to
get
a
permit,
that
make
the
whole
thing
bad,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
i
see
the
mother
paying
out
in
municipal
taxes
what
she
might
be
buying
food
for
her
child
with.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
rock
concerts
too,
go
with
all
of
this,
right?
