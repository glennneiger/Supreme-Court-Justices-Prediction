mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
forsyth,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
forsyth
county,
which
is
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
georgia,
comes
before
you
to
ask
you
to
reverse
a
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
invalidated
as
unconstitutional
on
its
face
our
ordinance
34,
which
is
our
parade
ordinance.
that
ordinance
imposes
a
fee
for
the
use
of
county
property
for
expressive
purposes.
the
court
below
found
that
the
cap
that
we
have
on
this
fee
of
$1,000
exceeded
a
nominal
amount.
they
based
that
finding
on
a
reading
of
a
case
of
this
court
from
1943
called
murdock
v.
pennsylvania.
that
case,
we
feel,
does
not
say
what
the
eleventh
circuit
says
it
says,
and
we
believe
that
the
true
precedent
to
rely
upon
in
our
case
is
cox
v.
new
hampshire,
a
1941
case
of
this
court,
wherein
at
the
beginning
of
the
consideration
of
the
fee
in
the
new
hampshire
statute,
this
court
said
that
there
remains
the
question
of
license
fees,
which
as
the
court
said,
referring
to
the
new
hampshire
court,
had
a
permissible
range
from
$300
to
a
nominal
amount,
a
recognition
we
believe
that
indicates
there
is
a
difference
between
$300
and
a
nominal
amount
in
1941.
we
believe
the
base
upon
which
this
court
utilized
in
cox
to
reach
its
conclusion
there,
may
begin
with
a
review
of
the
constitution,
article
4,
section
3
of
the
second
paragraph
which
grants
congress,
and
i
quote:
the
power
to
make
all
needful
rules
and
regulations
respecting
property
belonging
to
it.
the
tenth
amendment
reserves
to
the
states
those
powers
not
otherwise
taken
away
from
them
by
the
constitution,
and
this
court
then
in
cox
stated
basically
that
it
was
undoubted
that
there
is
authority
in
a
local
government
to
control
the
use
of
its
property.
we
believe
that
if
this
were
not
a
government,
and
if
it
did
not
involve
the
first
amendment,
that
there
would
be
no
question
that
charging
a
fee
for
the
use
of
one's
own
property
would
be
accepted
as
an
inherent
right
of
ownership.
what
this
case
represents
is
a
clash
between
that
inherent
right
of
property
ownership
and
the
public's
first
amendment
rights
to
use
public
property
for
first
amendment
purposes.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
our
ordinance
would
not
require
you--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--i
think
the
fifth
amendment
allows
you
to,
if
you
have
to
administer
an
ordinance,
and
if
you
have
to
police
demonstrations,
to
charge
a
fee
to
offset
the
cost
of
doing
that.
to
charge
you
for
the
privilege
of
free
speech,
that
is
not
allowed
and
that
is
not
what
we
are
doing.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
there
is
a
rental
for
the
use
of
the
property.
the
fee
is
designed
to
offset
time
for
administration
and
the
policing
costs
which
may
be
necessitated
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
demonstration.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
justice
o'connor,
we
believe
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
courthouse
grounds
can
be
considered
as
a
quintessential
public
forum;
however,
we
would
note
that
in
an
eleventh
circuit
case,
which
name
escapes
me,
they
took
the
richard
russell
federal
building
in
atlanta
and
basically
differentiated
the
different
types
of
forum,
depending
on
where
you
stood
in
the
plaza--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--we
have
no
problem
with
you
deciding
it
on
that
basis.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
yes,
ma'am,
we
believe
that,
and
we
do--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--we
believe
we
can
make
that
distinction.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
we
justify
it
because
a
group,
first
of
all,
a
group...
each
of
the
individuals,
if
they
don't
have
any
assets,
that
group
can
then
get
a
waiver
of
the
fee.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
no,
i
think
the
ordinance
indicates
that
each
individual
in
a
group
applies
for
a
waiver,
then
the
fee
can
be
waived.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
if
it
was
a
group
that
was
not
a
formal
association
or
a
corporation,
under
the
terms
of
our
ordinance,
that
is
what
we
are
stuck
with
until
we
can
get
back
and
fix
it.
and
as
the
eleventh
circuit
and
the
district
judge
recognized,
we
have
got
a
cumbersome
problem
with
that
particular
feature
of
our
ordinance.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
we
think
each
individual
could
come
in
and
sign
an
indigency
waiver.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
not
on
the
right
of
speech.
it
is
inefficient,
it
is
cumbersome,
and
we
would
like
to
fix
it
when
we
get
a
chance--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--justice
kennedy,
we
have
reviewed
or
tried
to
review
this
court's
cases,
and
there
are
numerous
indications
in
the
past
that
the
constitutional
rights
that
we
all
have
cannot
be
denied
by
lack
of
funds.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
the
poll
tax
case.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
the
poll
tax
cases,
i
believe,
were
only--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--or
some
of
them.
where
we
draw
the
line,
though,
is
in
an
organized
group
like
the
nationalist
movement
which
is
a
corporation,
and
we
feel--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--as
we
read
them,
they
invalidated
the
poll
tax
because
there
was
a
bad
motivation
there.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
there
is
an
alternative
way
to
spread
your
message
than
to
use
county
property,
and
a
poll
tax
situation,
if
you
didn't
pay
the
tax
you
couldn't
vote.
there
was
no
alternative
way
to
vote.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
we
have
chosen
to
make
the
exception,
but
we
believe
that
it
is
required
to
the
extent
that
if
a
poor
person
or
a
group
of
poor
people
want
to
engage
in
some
kind
of
free
speech,
that
they
should
be
entitled
to
do
so
if
they
can't
afford
to
pay
the
fee.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
yes,
but
if
it
is
our
street,
we
would
assume
that
they
come
under
our
ordinance
and
would
have
to
apply
for
a
permit
and
would
ordinarily
be
charged
a
fee,
but
we
are
providing
an
indigency
waiver
if
they
cannot
afford
that
if
they
are
individuals,
whether
we
have
to
or
not,
we
thought
we
did.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
justice
kennedy,
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
reach
that
issue
and
it
wasn't
briefed
in
any
great
detail,
and
i
would
assume
that
whatever
happens
to
this
case,
the
possibility
exists
that
the
eleventh
circuit
may
get
to
deal
with
the
indigency
provision
again.
as
i
have
said,
argument
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
probably
here
today
indicates
how
cumbersome
and
burdensome
our
indigency
provision
is.
but
until
this
litigation
is
ended,
we
really
have
not
attempted
to
make
it
more
workable.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
reach
it.
the
district
court
ruled
that
they
had
no
right
to
an
indigency
claim
based
on
an
analogy
to
title
28,
u.s.
code
1915,
where
the
federal
courts
don't
allow
corporations
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
they
were
issued
a
permit
contingent
on
payment
of
a
$100
fee
and
they
would
not
pay
so
they
did
not
march,
and
this
is
how
the
case
got
here.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
justice
o'connor,
in
1985
the
eleventh
circuit
came
down
with
a
decision
which
basically
said
that
they
read...
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
murdock,
they
just
said
that
you
could
not
charge
a
fee
for
police
activities.
we
were
faced
with--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
we
did
not
exercise
that
option.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
our
ordinance
puts
a
cap--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--our
principle
would,
justice
souter.
what
we
were
concerned
about
is
that
in
new
hampshire
in
1941,
their
ordinance
had
a
cap
and
we
felt
that
therefore,
we
ought
to
have
a
cap--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
thought
the
cap
in
new
hampshire,
and
our
cap,
is
probably
necessary.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
well,
we
have
a
balancing
of
interests
here,
obviously.
there
are
cases
of
this
court
which
indicate
that
sometimes
there
is
an
incidental
effect
upon
first
amendment
freedoms
when
fees
are
charged
or
time,
place
or
manner
restrictions
are
put
on
demonstrators.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
we
believe
it
is,
justice
souter,
because--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--well,
first
of
all--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--well,
it's
not...
the
content
doesn't
affect
how
the
ordinance
is
administered.
it
affects
costs
for
policing,
that
is
the
only
way
the
content
affects
anything.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
well,
i
think--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--well,
justice
souter,
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
question
is
to
say
that
in
cox
v.
new
hampshire
we
used
the
same
language
that
they
did
there.
that
was
a
time,
place
and
manner
case.
we
feel
that
where
you
have
a
licensing
or
regulation
scheme,
that
is
what
time,
place
or
manner
is,
you
have
a
permit
required
so
that
somebody
knows
that
somebody
is
coming
to
demonstrate
and
they
can
do
what
needs
to
be
done
to
adequately
police
and
take
care
and
prepare
for
whatever
the
demonstration
is.
and
that
whole
scheme
takes
money,
and
we
believe
that
is
what
was
recognized
in
cox--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--we
have
a
problem
if
cox
is
no
longer
viable.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
the
administrator
made
a
determination
that
he
wanted
to
charge
what
had
been
charged
the
year
before
so
that
there
would
be
no--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--i
think
the
generosity
was
an
attempt
to
avoid
what
has
happened,
to
coming
up
here,
and
not
out
of
agreement
with
the
message
by
any
means.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
the
ordinance
doesn't
necessarily
allow
it.
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
by
applying
it
and
reducing
it,
there
was
some
kind
of
unequal
treatment
given
the
nationalist
movement
as
compared
to
others
who
might
come
in
who
may
not
get
the
same
kind
of
treatment.
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
though
which
is,
as
i
understand
it,
what
the
issue...
at
least,
that
is
what
the
eleventh
circuit
ruled
on
here.
they
didn't
get
to
the
applied
aspects--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--justice
souter,
we
addressed
that
in
our
brief
by
citing
this
court's
language
in
massachusetts
v.
united
states
where
the
court
recognized,
and
i
think
that
was
a
supremacy
clause
case,
that
the
costs
the
faa
was
charging
states
and
anybody
else
using
their
facilities
was
negligible
in
relation
to
the
entire
costs,
but
the
court
indicated
that
they
could
nevertheless
be
considered,
because
congress
considered
it
that
way,
as
an
integral
and
essential
part
of
the
network
of
user
fees
that
the
congress
had
set
up.
and
we
feel
that
the
same
thing
is
being
accomplished
here.
it
may
be
negligible--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--well,
massachusetts
v.
united
states
is
not
that
old
of
a
case,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
'78
or
thereabouts,
and
i
don't
think
we
have
moved
that
far
in
the
last
14
years,
but,
in
other
words,
what
i
am
saying
is
any
impact
to
offset
our
costs
is
a
laudable
gesture,
i
think,
on
the
part
of
local
government
or
any
government.
and
whether
or
not
it
bears
an
actual
relationship
should
not
be
fatal
to
what
we
are
asking
to
be
allowed
to
do.
we
would
reemphasize
the
fact
that,
as
local
government
is
wont
to
do,
we
have
to
try,
the
best
we
can,
to
word
these
ordinances
in
view
of
the
first
amendment
considerations,
and
that
is
why
we
utilize
the
language
from
cox,
figuring
that
if
we
could
not
utilize
this
court's
language,
there
is
no
much
way
of
doing
what
we
wanted
to
do
legally.
we
don't
believe
that
the
distinction
we
are
making
between
utilizing
a
user
fee
concept
as
opposed
to
a
general
taxation
is
something
that
should
cause
any
problem
either.
i
think
all
local
government
or
any
government
has
the
ability
to
decide
whether
they
want
to
raise
revenues
by
taxing
their
respective
citizens
or
assessing
fees
against
those
who
come
in
and
want
to
use
their
facilities,
especially
when
you
have
a
situation
where
most
of
the
people
who
may
be
utilizing
whatever
facilities
are
available
are
not
tax-paying
citizens.
we
do
believe,
in
spite
of
the
alleged
equitor's
veto
which
i
am
sure
concerns
the
court
to
some
extent,
that
we
have
been
as
content-neutral
as
possible.
we
do
not
believe
there
is
any
basis
to
allege,
and
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
we
had
acted
in
good
faith
with
regard
to
the...
viewing
the
message
of
the
nationalist
movement,
and
at
this
point
that
has
never
been
seriously
attacked,
even
by
the
respondent
in
our
view.
the
concern
that
the
respondent,
the
nationalist
movement,
raises
concerning
the
impact
of
any
kind
of
fee
on
the
ability
of
anyone
to
express
themselves
on
important
issues
in
the
public,
we
believe
is
misplaced.
there
are
many
examples
of
burdens
on
resources
of
those
wishing
to
spread
their
message.
you
don't
have
free
access
to
radio.
the
air
is
free,
but
the
frequencies
are
auctioned
off
and
controlled
and
people
pay
for
those,
and
then
when
you
want
to
buy
time,
you
have
to
do
that,
you
have
to
buy
time.
taken
to
its
logical
extreme,
if
the
nationalist
movement's
founder
wanted
to
travel
from
mississippi
to
georgia
for
the
one
and
only
purpose
of
spreading
his
message
in
forsyth
county,
the
sales
taxes
on
his
airplane
ticket
or
the
gas
taxes
on
his
automobile
would
be
an
impact
on
his
ability
to
spread
his
message,
but
it
is
not,
it
is
incidental
and
it
is
a
burden
that
we
all
have
to
bear.
there
is
just
simply
no
free
lunch.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
our
ordinance
has
made
a
policy
decision--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--if
there
is
really
no
administrative
cost
to
the
county
and
there
is
no
policing
requirement
in
that
situation,
there
is
no
need
for
any
fee
because
there
would
be
no
basis
for
it,
and
it
would
be
struck
down.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
apparently,
the
government--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--as
we
understand
the
way
the
fcc
operates,
you
pay
to
be
able
to
have
one
of
those
channels
or
those
frequencies,
and
therefore,
after
that
it
is
your
decision
what
you
charge.
i
don't
know
how
much
government
involvement
goes
on
after
that,
but
it
does
and
you
do
have
to
pay.
it
is
not
free
unless
they,
out
of
the
goodness
of
their
heart,
those
who
have
frequencies,
want
to
give
you
the
time.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
i
don't
think
they
are
the
same,
but
it
impacts
on
first
amendment
expression,
whether
it
is
the
same
or
not,
and
therefore
we
don't
necessarily
see
why
there
should
be
any
great
concern
if
the
fees
are
reasonable
and
are
not
related
to
content,
and
are
related
to
direct
costs.
if
there
is
no
cost
then
there
should
be
no
fee,
and
we
don't
charge
one.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
excuse
me,
i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
i
am
trying
to
remember
the
facts
of
the
minnesota
star,
but
i
believe
it
had
something
to
do
with
where
you
put
your
papers.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
on
ink?
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
case,
justice
kennedy,
i
apologize.
i
don't...
if
there
is
a
tax
on
ink
and
anybody
that
buys
that
ink
has
to
pay
that
tax,
i
would
not
see
anything
particularly
wrong--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--we
don't
believe
it
is.
it
is
a
tax...
it
is
not
a
tax
at
all,
it
is
a
fee
to
offset
our
costs
in
providing
access,
property,
policing
and
administering
an
ordinance,
for
people
who
wish
to
do
free
expression.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
content,
other
than
sometimes
increasing
the
cost
of
policing,
which
we
have
tried
to
cap.
therefore,
we
don't
believe
it
is
a
tax
on
free
speech.
it
is
not
like
murdock.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
but
there
are
other
burdens
on
speech,
any
time,
place
or
manner--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--it
is
specific
in
that
it's
money,
but
it
is
not
specific
in
that
it
offsets
out-of-pocket
expenditures
or
time
by
salaried
employees
for
the
county,
and
therefore,
we
believe
we
are
entitled
to
recoup
it
based
on
the
cox
v.
new
hampshire
case,
which
we
believe
was
reasonable
and
logical
and
has
not
been...
and
there
appears
to
be
no
reason
that
we
can
see
why
it
should
not
still
have
vitality--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--that's
correct,
we
do.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
no,
this
ordinance.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
under
this
ordinance.
anybody
who
wants
to
use
county
property
for
any
reason--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--well,
a
parade,
a
procession--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--we
would.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
it
is
just
an
attempt
to
make
sure
we
know
what
is
going
on,
where
it's
going
on,
and
that
we
can
take
care
of
it
properly,
and
we
have
charged
the
fee
to
numerous
types
of
different
activities
that
have
occurred
in
the
county,
on
county
courthouse
property,
or
on
the
streets.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
i
hesitate,
justice
stevens,
because
there
were
two
cases
and
in
one
of
them,
the
record
would
reflect
that.
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
this
one
or
the
one
that
happened
before
this
in
the
district
court,
where
there
was
testimony
about
different
fees
that
had
been
charged
for
other
activities.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
i
know
the
administrator
testified,
i
think
he
has
charged
the
girl
scouts
$5.00
for
a
little
activity
that
they
had.
we
have
a
little
gazebo
that
sits
on
the
courthouse
corner--
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
--no,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
stubbs,
iii
it
depends,
justice
stevens,
because
if
it
is
a
very
simple
thing
like
the
girl
scouts,
then
he
simply
does
what
he
does
and
issues
a
permit
and
away
we
go.
if
it
something
that
requires
his
coordination
with
the
sheriff
and
the
fbi,
as
in
this
case,
the
obviously
that
is
a
greater
time.
thank
you.
