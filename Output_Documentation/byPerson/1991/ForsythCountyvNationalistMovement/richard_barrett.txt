mr.
richard
barrett
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court:
if
the
right
of
the
people
to
peacefully
assemble
to
petition
the
government
becomes
only
a
privilege
then
the
county
becomes
a
kingdom.
the
courthouse
is
a
castle
and
the
citizen
is
a
subject.
the
moat
around
this
castle,
if
you
will,
is
the
$1,000
permit
fee
for
those
seeking
to
assemble
on
the
steps,
and
there
is
no
drawbridge
for
either
the
poor
who
have
no
fee
to
pay
for
the
steps,
or
for
the
free,
who
refuse
to
kneel
upon
the
steps.
here
is
the
battering
ram
against
the
palace
of
privilege,
it
is
the
inalienable
and
universal
rights
of
man,
and
here
is
the
crossbow
against
the
ramparts
of
tyranny.
it
is
the
first
amendment.
and
here
are
the
keys
to
the
kingdom:
1943,
murdock.
there
can
be
no
charge
for
the
enjoyment
of
a
right
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution.
1944,
follett.
there
may
not
even
be
a
$1.00
per
day
fee
to
exercise
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
richard
barrett
cox
was
adopted,
your
honor,
at
a
time--
mr.
richard
barrett
--they
were
consistent
with
cox,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
first
of
all,
your
honor,
in
1941
there
was
no
public
forum
doctrine.
that
was
developed
recently--
mr.
richard
barrett
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
i
will
tell
you
why
if
i
may.
mr.
richard
barrett
first
of
all,
cox
spoke
specifically
that
it
was
distinguished
from
holding
an
open
public
meeting.
jameson
v.
texas
a
year
later
said
that
cox
dealt
with
the
convenience
of
the
traveling
public.
it
stood
for
the
idea
that
you
would
have
a
permit
so
that
competing
interests
wouldn't
occupy
the
same
space
at
the
same
time,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
argument.
however,
your
honor,
in
murdock--
mr.
richard
barrett
--correct.
mr.
richard
barrett
murdock,
your
honor,
if
it
please
the
court,
laid
down
the
rule
to
qualify
cox
so
that
it
said
that
when
there
was
no
right
for
there
to
be
a
charge
or
a
tax
upon
the
poor,
it
also--
mr.
richard
barrett
--no,
your
honor,
it
simply
stated--
mr.
richard
barrett
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
if
it
please
the
court,
your
honor,
this
is
not
a
parade.
there
is
no
march
involved
here.
this
is
simply
using
the
traditional
quintessential
public
forum
for
an
open-air
meeting.
it
is
not
a
parade.
mr.
richard
barrett
well,
your
honor,
perhaps
the
expense
is
the
right
of
the
poor
to
assemble
in
public,
and
i
submit
that
the
expense
is
cutting
off
the
right
of
the
poor;
also
under
terminello
in
1949
which
is
the
classic
case
of
the
heckler's
veto,
because
the
cost
then
would
be
if
the
demonstrator
says--
mr.
richard
barrett
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
perhaps
i
can
tell
you
how
in
forsyth
county
when
demonstrators
threatened,
and
also
in
atlanta
which
is
cited
somewhat
in
the
appendix,
when
demonstrators
said
they
were
going
to
come
and
throw
rocks
and
throw
bricks,
then
the
police
had
to
respond
to
that
emergency
and
then
under
the
county's
argument,
the
would-be
assemblers
or
paraders
as
the
case
may
be,
are
then
to
be
charged
for
the
cost
of
defending
against
the
hecklers?
i
submit
your
honor
that
that
simply
is
a
heckler's
veto.
it
is
as
onerous
today
as
it
is
in
1949.
next
of
course
was
the
alabama
case,
19--
mr.
richard
barrett
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
nothing
to
do
with
which?
mr.
richard
barrett
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
we
are
talking
about
the
poor
because
we
have
a
group
of
individuals
who
were
denied
under--
mr.
richard
barrett
--well,
we
have
several,
your
honor.
the
poor
is
one
of
them,
and
i
cite
the
poll
tax
cases,
the
cases
where
people
applied
to
run
for
office
and
were
waived
a
fee.
in
this
particular
case,
i--
mr.
richard
barrett
--certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
i
would
think.
mr.
richard
barrett
i
mean
before
the
court's
decision
they
could,
of
course.
mr.
richard
barrett
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
barrett
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
the
assets
of
the
organization
were
$90
and
some
cents.
it
simply
couldn't
pay
the
fee,
even
if
it
would
have
paid
the
fee.
mr.
richard
barrett
yes,
we
would,
your
honor.
we
would
have
paid
the
fee.
mr.
richard
barrett
it
does
in
this
respect--
mr.
richard
barrett
--may
i
address
that,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
barrett
let's
say
for
a
moment
that
you
see,
here
is
the
courthouse
green.
the
question
is,
someone
comes
up,
a
veteran
from
another
state.
he
says
i
want
to
march
today
or
i
want
to
assemble.
he
says,
well,
you
didn't
fill
out
an
affidavit
of
poverty.
what
about
his
rights
to
travel,
your
honor?
let's
say
then
that
someone
comes
up
and
they
say,
i
don't
want
my
name
to
be
known.
i
don't
want
to
sign
an
affidavit
of
poverty
under
the
privacy
provisions
of
the
constitution.
he
can't
assemble
then.
what
about
someone
that
comes
up
and
says,
all
right,
i
want
to
sign--
mr.
richard
barrett
--well,
i
am
speaking
of
brown
v.
socialist
workers'
party,
the
'74
nuclear
freeze
campaign
of
ohio
which...
and
of
course,
the
naacp
v.
alabama
that
based
it
on
freedom
of
association,
that
says
that
the
right
of
people
to
protect
their
freedom
of
association
is
a
privacy
right,
your
honor.
so
someone
comes
up
and
says
i--
mr.
richard
barrett
--all
right,
your
honor,
i
was
trying
to--
mr.
richard
barrett
--in
this
particular
case,
the
convenience
that
i
am
speaking
of,
i
would
like
to
perhaps
finish
what
i
was
saying
and
then
i
will
address
that
the
best
way
i
can,
your
honor.
someone
comes
up
and
you
have
to
sign
an
affidavit,
well,
who
is
going
to
pay
the
notary
and
what
is
the
notary
fee?
the
county
has
said
that
if
you
have
2,000
members
in
your
organization,
let's
say
all
across
the
country,
do
they
all
have
to
be
notified?
do
they
all
have
to
respond
and
then,
do
they
all
sign
affidavits?
who
is
going
to
pay
the
notary
fee
for
that?
it
is
a
tax
and
a
burden
on
the
poor.
also,
your
honor,
i
cited
the
poll
tax
case,
that
was
the
harper
decision
in
1966,
and
i
might
as
well
mention
shuttlesworth
in
1969
which
ruled
that
the
right
of
assembly
is
reaffirmed.
in
1972,
bullock,
there
can
be
no
fees
on
the
poor
to
abridge
constitutional
rights.
then
in
1983,
grace,
the
public
forum
defined,
and
here
you
have
it,
your
honor,
and
also
in
1988,
the
boos,
case
which
stood
for
the
proposition
that
there
can't
be
regulations
as
a
guise
to
abridge
speech.
perhaps
this
is
the
classic
stamp
act
rebellion
as
the
forsyth
county
rebellion.
it
was
said
at
the
time
of
the
stamp
act
that
if
you
simply
paid
a
fee,
a
nominal
fee,
you
could
write
whatever
you
wanted,
but
you
had
to
pay
for
the
paper
to
put
the
printing
on,
as
was
said,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
barrett
--and
they
said
the
same
thing
in
the
stamp
act,
and
here
they
are
in
essence
saying,
all
you
have
to
do
is
pay
a
fee
to
stand
on
the
steps.
mr.
richard
barrett
i
hadn't
thought
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
if
it
means
that
you
would
waive
your
own
life
to
appear
in
public
in
the
united
states
of
america
to
deliver
a
speech
in
the
quintessential
public
forum--
mr.
richard
barrett
--no
more
than
they
would
at
the
capitol
of
the
united
states,
your
honor,
which
has
no
charge,
no
more
than
they
would
on
the
steps
of
this
very
court.
mr.
richard
barrett
there
is
no
fee
under
the
constitution
in
freedom,
and
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
there
is
no
pay-as-you-go
in
patriotism.
mr.
richard
barrett
that
was
the
decision
in
murdock,
your
honor,
there
can
be
no
fee
for
a
right
enjoyed
under
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
barrett
and
of
course,
we
respond
that
is
the
heckler's
veto,
your
honor,
that
if
the
expenses
are
occasioned
by
having
hostile
counterdemonstrators,
then
the
fee
escalates
beyond
calculation
and
then
the
right
of
assembly
is
abridged,
and
the
right
of
the
people
to
assemble
will
not
be
abridged,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
well,
actually,
there
isn't
a
monetary
limit.
you
notice
there
is
the
toilet
charge,
your
honor.
there
is
the
medical
charge.
since
the
county
has
already
said
in
its
brief
that
they
regard
this
speech
as
deficient
and
they
say
that
the
only
reason
for
the
permit
fee
in
their
brief
is
to
rid
the
public
forum
of
unwelcome
harassment,
well,
then
this
speech
must
be
so
nauseating
that
they
would
have
to
charge
for
more
toilets
for
the
public
that
is
going
to
vomit
at
the
assembly
that
is
wanting
to
be
put
on.
mr.
richard
barrett
it's
an
emotional
issue
based
on
humanity,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
under
the
ordinance
it
really
isn't
a
cap
at
all,
your
honor,
and
it
is
a--
mr.
richard
barrett
--because
they
have
the
toilet
fees,
the
medical
fees,
the
miscellaneous
fees,
which
they
say
in
the
administrator's
opinion--
mr.
richard
barrett
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
barrett
that
is
not
what
i
stated,
your
honor,
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
two
separate
things.
mr.
richard
barrett
i
said
that
there
is
not
a
$1,000
cap,
there
can
be
more
than
$1,000
under
some
provisions
in
the
ordinance.
mr.
richard
barrett
no,
sir,
not
for
hecklers.
although,
supposedly--
mr.
richard
barrett
--supposedly,
if
there
were
more
hecklers
there
might
have
to
be
more
toilets,
there
might
have
to
be
more--
mr.
richard
barrett
--hecklers
produce
more
than
toilets,
your
honor.
notice,
your
honor,
that
the
other
additional
fees
are
couched
in
what
they
call
the
administrator's
opinion,
and
there
simply
seems
to
be
too
much
discretion
in
that,
your
honor.
and
then,
your
honor,
for
example,
let's
say
that--
mr.
richard
barrett
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
which
other
fees,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
barrett
we
have
challenged
the
entire
thing,
your
honor,
saying
that
there
shouldn't
be
any
fee
at
all,
not
a
nominal
fee,
any
more
than
there
should
be
on
the
right
to
vote
or
the
right
for
a
candidate
to
run
for
a
public
office
because
he
is
indigent,
or
the
right
of
a
jehovah's
witness
to
hand
out
literature
without
having
to
pay
$1.00
a
day.
mr.
richard
barrett
although
that
is
the
issue
before
the
court
as
it
came
from
the
eleventh
circuit,
your
honor,
of
course,
if
the
court
in
its
wisdom
sees
fit,
we
would
like
to
be
able
to
say
that
the
court
has
said
that
the
modern
free
speech
cases
have
ruled
out
fees
or
taxes
that
burden
the
first
amendment.
mr.
richard
barrett
yes,
we
would,
your
honor.
and
then
as
a
follow
up
to
that,
your
honor,
let's
say
that
the
$1,000
is
said
to
be
reasonable
perhaps.
well,
if
it's
reasonable,
then
of
course
it
could
be
$2,000
or
$5,000,
and
then
there
is
the
city
jurisdiction
which
has
the
streets
around
the
courthouse.
so
there
is
another
$2,000
or
$3,000
or
$4,000
or
more,
and
then
of
course
there
is
the
state,
its
gormandizing
attitude
toward
its
potential
user
fees,
and
then
you
have
to
cross
the
state
highway
perhaps,
another.
and
there
is
the
burden,
there
is
the
burden,
outlawing
if
you
will,
demonstrators
who
are
not
able
to
pay
to
speak
or
to
assemble.
mr.
richard
barrett
the
cases
have
distinguished
that
to
some
extent,
your
honor,
because
that
would
be
a
commercial
enterprise,
whereas
this
is
not
a
commercial
enterprise.
this
is
purest
speech
in
its
most
quintessential
form.
mr.
richard
barrett
yes,
your
honor,
and
it
was
distinguished
from
this
case
because
it
simply
meant
the
volume
could
be
turned
down
and
in
the
lower
courts,
the
original
court
said
that
that
was
the--
mr.
richard
barrett
--no.
that
is
not
our
argument,
but
that
is
an
argument
that
has
been
made
by
some,
we
don't
make
that
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
i
was
saying
it
could
be
made,
but
i
am
simply
just
saying,
we
are
not
a
commercial
enterprise,
and
so
therefore,
in
no
sense
would
we
say
that--
mr.
richard
barrett
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
this
case
from
ward
v.
rock
against
racism?
mr.
richard
barrett
if
it
is
the
public
forum,
i
would
say
the
first
amendment
and
the
right
to
petition
the
government,
the
right
to
speak,
the
right
to
assemble
bars
any
fees
in
that
public
forum,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
barrett
well,
perhaps,
your
honor,
if
someone,
let's
say
luke
perry
of
beverly
hills
comes
to
town
and
he
is
on
the
courthouse
steps
surrounded
by
young
ladies
seeking
autographs,
he
would
be
welcomed
with
bureaucratic
hosannas,
but
on
the
other
hand,
jerry
brown,
not
the
one
running
for
president,
but
the
leader
of
the
forsyth
county
parade,
he
is
on
the
steps
wanting
to
collect
signatures
to
petition
the
government.
he
meets
with
bureaucratic
boondoggles.
that
is
the
content
neutrality
that
we
object
to.
on
the
other
hand,
the
county
says,
well,
he
can
meet
in
the
basement
of
the
courthouse.
your
honor,
spiderwebs
and
fluorescent
lights
don't
suffice
for
open
air
and
fresh
air
of
freedom.
mr.
richard
barrett
they
said
simply
that
on
its
face,
$1,000
was
not
nominal
and
they
read
murdock
to
say
that
it
must
be
nominal.
mr.
richard
barrett
i
have
to
defend
it
because
we
want
to
win
the
case--
mr.
richard
barrett
--but
i
also
argue
alternatively,
your
honor,
in
our
brief,
we
say
that
any
fee,
nominal
or
otherwise,
abridges
the
first
amendment
in
this
case.
your
honor,
my
mind
is
in
torment
because
i
am
looking
for
the
compelling
reasons
which
may
be
permissible
to
abridge
freedom
of
speech
and
assembly
in
the
quintessential
public
forum.
is
it
the
suppression
of
vice?
no
one
is
bringing
placards
that
are
obscene
to
the
courthouse.
is
it
the
suppression
of
litter?
is
it
not
suggested
here
by
the
record.
is
it
the
suppression
of
subversion?
are
the
secrets
of
the
patriot
missiles
being
read
on
the
steps?
is
the
courthouse
decrepit
to
where
bricks
are
falling
down
and
safety
is
an
issue?
none
of
these
issues,
your
honor.
there
might
be
some
compelling
reasons
there,
but
not
here.
mr.
richard
barrett
not,
your
honor,
if
it
is
simply
to
notify
the
authorities,
to
prevent
competing
interests
from
occupying
the
same
space
at
the
same
time,
as
cox
said,
for
control.
mr.
richard
barrett
the
record
will
show,
your
honor,
that
we--
mr.
richard
barrett
--the
record
shows
we
offered
to
pay
$1.00
or
$2.00
to
the
county
for
whatever
charge--
mr.
richard
barrett
--that's
correct,
and
i
cite
in
the
brief,
we
did
a
random
survey--
mr.
richard
barrett
--cox
was
confined,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
a
very
limited
fact
circumstance,
and
in
murdock--
mr.
richard
barrett
--they
mentioned,
for
example,
a
circus
where
they
had
spectators,
but
your
honor,
the
differentiation
here
is
we
are
talking
about
hostile
counterdemonstrators
that
are
threatening
the
safety
of
those
exercising
their
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
richard
barrett
we
have
no
problem
giving
them
our
name,
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that
that--
mr.
richard
barrett
--well,
your
honor,
if
it
please
the
court,
if
there
is
someone
that
wants
their
name
not
to
be
divulged,
there
should
be
some
way
in
the
ordinance
to
protect
their
confidentiality
as
an
individual.
we
have
no
problem
because
we
are
registered
with
the
state
and
we
are
a
corporation.
mr.
richard
barrett
if
there
is
a
valid
exception
where
the
confidentiality
could
be
respected,
your
honor,
then
there
would
be
no
challenge:
i
find
no
acknowledgement,
your
honor,
in
the
county's
argument
whatsoever
of
the
public
forum,
and
i
noticed
a
bit
of
a
freudian
slip
on
counsel
when
he
said
it
is
a
tax,
and
he
corrected
himself.
but
it
is
a
tax,
your
honor,
and
i
simply
draw
the
court's
attention
in
what
meager
abilities
i
have
to
forsyth
county
or
any
county
and
ask
what
do
we
see
here
when
this
assembly
takes
place,
and
how
valuable
is
that
to
america?
i
see
americana
and
i
see
the
stump
speech.
i
can't
put
a
price
on
it,
but
i
see
the
furrowed
brow
of
labor
listening.
i
see
the
tender
graces
of
motherhood
feeling.
i
hear
the
assertion
of
youth
speaking
out.
mr.
richard
barrett
balance
that
if
you
will,
your
honor,
between
perhaps
the
sharpening
right
there
of
democracy's
rusty
instruments.
can
i
speak
of
the
spoken
work
and
the
sparks
that
come
from
it?
can
i
speak
of
reason
and
the
glitter
that
lightens
our
minds?
can
i
speak
of
the
shiny
sword
of
reason
that
ousts
tyranny
from
among
us?
your
honor,
they
have
spoken
of
money.
may
i
speak
of
freedom?
they
have
spoken
of
convenience.
may
i
speak
of
happiness?
someone
asked
if
i
would
pay
a
fee.
your
honor,
write
this
epitaph,
if
you
will,
on
my
tomb:
the
road
not
taken,
but
not
the
speech
not
given.
i
have
been
asked
if
it
applies
to
the
rich--
mr.
richard
barrett
--perhaps.
as
the
bible
says,
your
honor,
faith
comes
from
hearing.
and
as
martin
luther
said,
here
i
stand,
i
can
do
nothing
else.
to
the
weight
of
the
coin,
if
you
will,
of
king
george
iii;
rockefeller's
greenbacks;
jose
williams'
coffers...
the
ones
who,
by
the
way,
the
record
will
show,
could
march,
perhaps
could
afford
the
fee,
there
must
be
the
fulcrum
to
that
weight,
and
that
is
the
first
amendment.
and
i
think
it
says
to
us
over
the
ages,
no
dearth
of
purse
shall
curse
our
birth;
who
picks
the
pockets
of
the
poor
or
the
nationalist,
gets
no
recoupment
whatsoever,
your
honor;
but
who
weans
the
humblest
of
our
citizens
on
that
mother's
milk
of
the
first
amendment
makes
us
a
stronger
nation
and
an
ennobled
people.
if
we
were
to
freeze
this
court
in
the
ice
of
1941,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
barrett
--well,
your
honor,
i
am
a
classical
music
fan,
but
i
am
prepared
to
let
mick
jagger
play
so
long
as
jerry
brown
can
petition
the
government
in
the
traditional
public
forum,
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
were
speaking
about
law
that
is
laid
low
in
a
cold
coffin,
your
honor,
then
i
would
speak
of
the
past
and
the
glories
of
the
law
that
were.
but
i
came
here
today,
your
honor,
because
i
regard
the
law
as
youthful
and
zealous,
and
therefore,
may
i
give
you
my
simple
invocation
to
glories
of
the
law
yet
to
come,
and
it
is
this:
toward
the
uplands
where
the
american
people
assembles
without
fees;
where
the
american
nation
speaks
without
fear;
and
where
the
american
way
of
life
proceeds
without
end.
