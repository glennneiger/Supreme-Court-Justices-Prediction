justice
kennedy
what
is
the
principle
upon
which
you
base
your
conclusion
that
there
must
be
an
indigent
waiver?
why
don't
the
rich
have
an
equal
right
to
speech?
justice
kennedy
i
can
think
of
the
appellate
transcript
case,
griffin
and
illinois,
and
i
stop
about
there.
can
you
give
me
some
help?
justice
kennedy
pardon
me?
justice
kennedy
the
poll
tax
cases?
justice
kennedy
that
is
what
we
are
here
to
inquire,
i
thought
that
was
your
submission
to
justice
o'connor,
that
a
indigency
waiver
is
required,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
very
important
part
of
this
case.
justice
kennedy
why
isn't
this
case
like
the
instance
where
a
municipality
charged
ink
used
by
the
press?
justice
kennedy
why
isn't
this
a
case
like
the
one
where
the
minnesota
star
was
challenging
the
ordinance
in
which
the
city
taxed
ink
used
by
the
press?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
much
closer
to
this
case
than
your
hypothetical
about
a
sales
tax
on
a
air
ticket
that
everybody
has
to
pay.
this
is
a
tax
that
has
a
particular
bearing
on
speech.
justice
kennedy
suppose
you
had
a
tax
on
ink.
justice
kennedy
on
ink,
that
is
used
by
the
print
media,
and
the
whole
bearing
of
the
tax,
the
whole
burden
of
the
tax
falls
on
the
media.
we
have
ruled
that
that
is
unconstitutional,
have
we
not?
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
whole
burden
of
the
tax
falls
on
the
press
because
there
was
an
exemption
in
that
case
for
small
purchases
of
ink,
just
ink
in
bulk.
isn't
that
what
this
case
is?
this
is
a
tax
that
has
a
real
burden
on
speech
and
expression
and
on
nothing
else.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
does
it
apply
to
company
picnics
or
something?
justice
kennedy
i
am
not
saying
it
is
a
tax
on
free
speech.
i
am
saying
the
burden
falls
on
speech.
justice
kennedy
but
they
are
general
burdens.
this
is
a
specific
one.
justice
kennedy
i
am
not
sure
of
the
theory
of
your
case.
suppose
that
an
individual
or
a
group
that
wanted
to
use
the
public
square
could
afford
the
fee.
could
the
municipality
charge
that
fee
consistent
with
the
constitution?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
poor.
justice
kennedy
then
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
distinction
in
rich
and
poor.
justice
kennedy
so
then
we
shouldn't
be
talking
about
the
poor,
and
that
was
the
whole
thrust
of
your
argument
as
i
understood
it
from--
justice
kennedy
--but
the
principle
of
the
case
that
you
are
arguing
has
nothing
to
do
with
that,
then
why
don't
we
proceed
to
the
principle
that
you
are
arguing,
and
i
would
like
to
know
what
that
principle
is.
justice
kennedy
counsel,
you
have
30
minutes.
you
can
use
the
time
any
way
you
want
i
suppose;
we
still
haven't
gotten
to
your
theory
of
the
case.
justice
kennedy
i
would
like
to
know
why
this
ordinance
is
invalid
if
someone
can
afford
to
pay
the
fee.
justice
kennedy
then
i
still
don't
know
the
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question.
why
couldn't
a
rock
concert
be
required
to
pay
this
fee?
please
don't
say
that
it
is
a
commercial
enterprise,
because
we
have
now
gone
through
colloquy
and
established
that
that
is
not
a
valid
ground
for
distinguishing
the
case.
justice
kennedy
so
do
you
have
a
valid
ground
for
distinguishing
the
case?
justice
kennedy
from
the
hypothetical
of
a
rock
concert
wanting
to
come
in
and
use
this
facility
and
having
to
pay
the
charge.
