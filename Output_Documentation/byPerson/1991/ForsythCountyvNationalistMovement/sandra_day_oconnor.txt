justice
o'connor
now
are
we
dealing
here
with
the
quintessential
public
forum,
the
streets
and
open
spaces
in
the
county?
justice
o'connor
for
purposes
of
our
resolution
of
this
case,
you
agree
that
we
should
decide
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
a
public
forum?
justice
o'connor
now
do
you
think
that
the
constitution
requires
the
county
to
make
any
exception
for
indigents
and
those
who
are
unable
to
pay
a
fee?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
this
ordinance
does
that
when
it
doesn't
extend
it
to
a
group
that
has
no
assets?
justice
o'connor
how
would
you
justify
that,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
but
not
under
the
terms
of
the
ordinance,
which
would
extend
only
to
individuals,
i
thought.
justice
o'connor
so
that
if
the
group
organizing
a
particular
gathering
on
the
public
streets
in
forsyth
county
wanted
to
get
a
permit,
you
would
want
an
affidavit
of
indigency
from
every
person
participating,
is
that
it?
justice
o'connor
and
if
it
were
an
informally
organized
group?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
is
at
all
burdensome
on
the
right
of
speech?
justice
o'connor
--mr.
stubbs,
the
county
administrator
in
this
case
just
considered
costs
of
administration
of
the
permit
application?
justice
o'connor
why
did
the
administrator
not
consider
the
cost
of
police
required
for
the
march,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
your
ordinance
refers
to
the
cost
of
police.
justice
o'connor
but
in
deference
to
the
eleventh
circuit's
rulings
in
some
other
case--
justice
o'connor
--i
see.
but
i
take
it
the
principle
upon
which
you
rest
here
would
not
limit
your
right
in
the
manner
in
which
the
eleventh
circuit
did.
in
other
words,
the
principle
that
you
espouse
here
would
authorize
you
to
charge
for
the
cost
of
police,
subject
to
an
indigency
exception.
