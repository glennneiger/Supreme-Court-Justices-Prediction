so
that
in
your
view,
you
could
have
had
an
ordinance
that
would
have
allowed
you
to
charge
$700,000
for
the
civil
rights
demonstrations
or
parades
in
the
earlier
instances?
justice
souter
i
know
yours
does,
but
your
principle
would
allow
you
to
do
that,
is
that
correct?
justice
souter
well,
no,
i
realize
that,
but
i
just
want
to
understand
what
the
rule
is
that
you
are
ultimately
relying
on,
subject
to
the
cap.
do
you
think
you
have
a
problem
if
you,
in
effect,
are
allowed
literally
or
would
be
allowed
literally
to
adjust
the
fee
in
accordance
with
the
difficulty
of
policing
the
demonstration
because
you
would
thereby
have
a
relationship
between
the
likely
controversial
nature
of
the
message
or
of
the
point
being
made
by
the
parade
or
demonstration
which
would
in
effect
make
it
content-based
or
viewpoint-based?
justice
souter
but
can
you
get
out
of
it
that
way,
because
as
i
understand
it,
at
least
within
your
$1,000
limit,
you
would
still
be
adjusting
or
you
would
still
be
setting
your
fee
within
the
$1,000
limit
depending
upon
the
likely
cost,
and
that
would
bear
a
relationship,
i
suppose,
to
the
controversial
nature
of
what
was
being
demonstrated
for.
justice
souter
but
this
isn't
a
time,
place
or
manner
restriction--
justice
souter
--how
is
it
a
time,
place
or
manner
restriction
if
it
is
varying
depending
on...
or
varying
in
relationship
to
the
content
of
the
message?
justice
souter
i
mean,
by
definition,
you
know,
what
is
allowed
under
time,
place
and
manner
starts
with
the
assumption
that
you
don't
have
that
kind
of
a
content-based
determination.
justice
souter
what's
the
difference?
justice
souter
i
mean,
if
you
are
going
to...
if
you
are
say
that
your
principle
allows
you
to
charge
in
relation
to
the
cost
of
policing,
you
are
saying
the
same
thing.
justice
souter
but
basically,
you
are
resting
on
cox?
i
mean,
if
we
think
cox
is
no
longer
consonant
with
present
first
amendment
analysis,
you
do
not,
as
i
understand
it,
have
an
argument
that
nonetheless,
your
scheme
should
survive?
justice
souter
mr.
stubbs,
let's
assume
that
you
could
meet
justice
scalia's
concern
and
that
the
generosity,
or
we
won't
call
it
generosity,
the
reduction
was
subject
to
some
principle,
so
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
danger
of
its
varying
depending
on
the
sympathy
or
lack
of
sympathy
with
the
organization,
assuming
that
the
amounts
would
be,
on
some
principle
basis,
reduced
down
to
what
perhaps
is
a
nominal
amount
in
today's
values;
don't
you
then
encounter
a
different
problem,
that
what
you
are
charging
really
doesn't
bear
any
relationship
at
all
between,
or
to,
rather,
the
expense
that
you
are
trying
to
offset?
i
mean,
if
you
charged
$100
or
even
your
$1,000
in
the
case
of
the
$700,000
parade,
i
mean,
there
just
wouldn't
be
any
significant
relationship
between
what
you
were
doing
and
the
object
which
supposedly
justifies
what
you
are
doing,
i.e.,
offsetting
costs.
justice
souter
is
that
going
to
pass
first
amendment
muster
today?
