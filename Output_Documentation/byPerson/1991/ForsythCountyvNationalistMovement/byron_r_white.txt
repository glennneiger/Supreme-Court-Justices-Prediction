justice
white
cox
just
dealt
with
a
parade,
i
mean,
with
a
meeting
in
the
streets,
and
specifically
noted
that
there
was
no
question
of
passing
out
literature
or
solicitation
or
anything
like
that.
justice
white
so
we
are
just
talking
about
a...
and
murdock
was
something
else
again.
justice
white
yes,
but
murdock
didn't
deal
with
a
parade.
it
didn't
say
that.
it
didn't
deal
with
a
parade
at
all,
murdock.
justice
white
this
was
handing
out
literature.
justice
white
do
you
object
to
having
to
get
a
permit?
justice
white
let's
assume
that
that
costs
the
county
some
money.
do
you
think...
you
would
apply
here,
alternate
ground,
no
fee
whatsoever?
justice
white
right?
justice
white
but
you
would
not
think
that
they...
let's
assume
that
they
could
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it
was
going
to
cost
them
$50.00
to
process
your
permit
and
you
would
say
they
could
not
charge
that
money?
justice
white
that
certainly
is
inconsistent
with
cox.
justice
white
they
were
talking
about
a
parade.
they
weren't
talking
about
handing
out
literature
or
making
speeches.
and
that
is
what
is
involved
in
this
case,
is
an
occupation
of
the
streets.
