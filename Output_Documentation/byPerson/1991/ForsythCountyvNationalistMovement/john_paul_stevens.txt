justice
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
whether...
what
variation
in
the
fees
there
has
been
for
these
other
events
like
bike
races
and
so
forth?
justice
stevens
so
it
is
a
matter
of
public
record
in
one
of
the
two
cases?
justice
stevens
what
does
the
record
show?
justice
stevens
at
least
it
is
not
a
flat
$100.00
from
everybody--
justice
stevens
--even
though
i
suppose
the
administration
is
pretty
much
the
same,
the
cost
of
administration
probably
is
pretty
much
the
same?
justice
stevens
mr.
barrett,
let
me
just
clear
up
one
thing.
justice
stevens
you
have
not,
though,
in
this
case,
challenged
these
other
fees,
have
you?
justice
stevens
the
toilet
fees,
and
you
mentioned
there
are
a
bunch
of
others
than
could
get
the
cap
over
$1,000.
justice
stevens
are
you
willing
to
have
us
decide
the
case,
so
the
only
fee
at
issue
is
this
potential
fee
of
up
to
$1,000.
justice
stevens
but
all
i
am
saying,
if
i
understand
your
argument
correctly,
you
would
make
the
same
argument
even
if
there
were
no
other
fees
at
all?
