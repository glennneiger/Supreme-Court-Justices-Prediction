chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
argument
no.
91-538,
forsyth
county,
georgia
v.
the
nationalist
movement.
mr.
stubbs.
is
the
name
of
the
county
pronounced
forsyth
or
forsyth?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
some
claim
by
the
respondents
here
that
they
were
indigent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
did
the
lower
courts
treat
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
respondent
fill
out
the
necessary
affidavit
specified
in
the
ordinance?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
they
then
get
a
permit
or--
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stubbs.
mr.
barrett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
barrett,
do
you
think
those
cases
overruled
cox?
chief
justice
rehnquist
will
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
cox,
cox
spoke
of
a
fee
ranging
from
a
nominal
amount
to
$300.00
in
1941
and
said
there
was
nothing
unconstitutional
about
that
fee.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
said
cox
was
consistent
with
follett
and
the
other
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
please
do.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
case
in
point
here
is
cox
because
this
is
a
parade
and
cox
dealt
with
a
parade.
murdock
didn't
deal
with
the
situation
you
have
here
or
with
the
situation
that
cox
dealt
with.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
entails
the
same
sort
of
expenses
for
the
county
as
a
parade
would.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
am
not
at
all
sure
terminello
is
even
good
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
said
i
am
not
at
all
sure
terminello
is
even
good
law
anymore.
chief
justice
rehnquist
whoa,
what
are
the
privacy
provisions
of
the
constitution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
barrett,
i
think
you
better
calm
down
a
little
and
address
the
issues.
i
think
we
have
heard
enough
rhetoric.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
suggest
you
try
to
keep
your
emotions
under
control
and
try
to
discuss
the
merits
of
the
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
commercial
enterprise--
--mr.
barrett,
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
that
justice
kennedy
wrote,
ward
against
rock
against
racism,
i
think
the
court
said
a
concert
like
that
did
have,
did
come
under
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
have
no
quarrel
with
that--
--it
wasn't
distinguished
on
the
basis
that
you
suggested
a
moment
ago,
commercial
versus
other
kinds
of
speech.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
that
the
ordinance
wasn't
content-neutral,
did
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
defend
that
result
here
entirely
apart
from
content
neutrality
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
sure.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
argument
not
made?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
barrett.
mr.
stubbs,
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-538,
forsyth
county,
georgia
versus
the
nationalist
movement
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
