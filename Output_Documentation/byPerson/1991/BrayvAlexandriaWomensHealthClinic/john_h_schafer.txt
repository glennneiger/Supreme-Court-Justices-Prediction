mr.
john
h.
schafer
mr.
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
posed
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
a
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
to
protect
federal
rights
when
because
of
mob
violence
and
mob
action,
local
law
enforcement
authorities
are
unable
to
maintain
law
and
order.
it
is
precisely
the
situation
for
which
the
statute
was
written.
the
analogy
to
the
facts
of
1865
to
'71,
say,
when
this
statute
was
written,
are
striking.
there,
as
here,
you
had
conspiratorial
mass
action
which
was
intended
to
and
did
frustrate
the
exercise
of
federal
rights.
local
law
enforcement
authorities--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--this
case,
justice
o'connor,
was
tried
9
days
after
the
complaint
was
filed.
and
the
complaint
did
not
make
a
hinder
or
prevent
claim.
the
evidence
then
developed
it.
in
my
judgment,
that
claim
is
good.
although
courts
below
have
not
made
findings
on
them,
the
court
may
want
to
remand
for
findings
on
it.
but
the
evidence
established
a
hinder...
in
my
judgment...
a
hinder
and
prevent
claim.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
i
would
say
it
does.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
i
agree
with
that.
i
agree
with
that.
i
would
not
consent
that
it
doesn't...
i
think
griffin--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--yes.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
as
i
read
griffin,
i
think
the
class-based
animus
is
written
into
the
statute
by
the
equal
protection
and
equal
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
and
i
think
that
the
evidence,
as
i
say,
the
odd
thing
in
this
case
is
that
under
the
federal
rules,
we
could
amend
our
complaint
today
to
accommodate
the
finding...
the
facts
that
were
developed
in
a
court
below,
and
we
don't
even
have
to
amend
a
complaint
under
the
federal
rules
to
make
that
claim,
because
the
federal
rules
provide
that
if
the
evidence
establishes
a
claim,
the
pleadings
will
be
deemed
to
be
amended
to
encompass
that
claim.
and
i
think
that
we
do
have
that
claim
based
on
these
facts.
and
these
facts
are
basically,
as
i'm
sure
the
court
knows,
that
the
tactics
of
these
people
are
to
frustrate
law
enforcement.
they
don't
announce
in
advance
where
they're
going
to
set
up
their
blockades
of
clinics,
which
clinics
are
going
to
be
blockaded.
they
announce
the
dates,
but
they
don't
announce
where,
and
so
local
police
and
authorities
don't
know
where.
and
so
suddenly
at
some
medical
clinic
someplace,
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
people
early
in
the
morning
around,
blockading,
and
preventing
ingress
and
egress
from
the
clinic.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
we
don't
do
that,
your
honor.
they
keep
saying
we
do
that,
but
that's
not
what
we
do.
our
contention
is
simply
this;
that
when
you
target
a
right
of
a
class
and
attempt
to
take
away
that
class'
constitutional
right,
you
are
discriminating
against
that
class,
the
entire
class.
and
the
class
here
is
not
women
seeking
abortions
as
they
keep
arguing.
the
class
is
not
defined
by
an
activity
or
by
an
idea,
or
anything
else.
it's
defined
simply
by
the
constitution.
all
women
have
this
right.
these
people
want
to
destroy
that
right.
and
the
way
they
do
it
is
target
the
women
who
are
exercising
the
right.
but
the
losers,
if
they
win,
the
losers
are
all
women.
all
women.
the
right
of
all
women
is
lost.
and
it's
just
like--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--yes.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
in
my
judgment,
as
novotny
shows,
they
have
their
own
independent
cause
of
action
for
violation
of
1985(3).
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
the
purpose,
though,
the
whole
effort
is
to
take
away
the
right
to
choose.
not
the
right
of
physicians
to
practice
medicine.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
yes,
your
honor,
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
the
doctors
have
a
constitutional
right
to
practice
medicine,
this
kind
of
medicine.
i
don't
really
know.
but
the
right
that
these
people
are
targeting
is
a
woman's
right.
they
are
trying
to
destroy
a
woman's
right.
and
when
you
do
that,
just
like
in
johnson
controls,
when
an
employer
discriminates
in
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
between
women
and
men
by
saying
to
women
who
are
capable
of
bearing
children,
you
may
not
have
certain
jobs,
that's
a
discrimination
not
against
just
them,
it's
a
discrimination
against
all
women.
and
in
satty,
when
the
employer
says
when
you
get
pregnant,
you're
going
to
lose
your
seniority
rights,
that's
not
just
a
discrimination
against
those
directly
impacted
by
the
discrimination,
it's
a
discrimination
against
women.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
i'm
not
sure
they
do.
novotny
suggested
he
had
one
because
of
a
violation
of
a
federal
right.
but
here,
he
only...
under
the
words
of
the
statute,
they
have
a
cause
of
action
if
they
are
denied
any
right
or
privilege
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
or
if
they
suffer
injury
by
their
person
or
property.
and
if
they
suffer
injury
by
their
person
or
property
via
a
class-based
discriminatory
effort
to
destroy
the
abortion
right,
i
suppose
yes,
they
do.
i
don't
know
why
they
wouldn't,
offhand.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
as
i...
certainly
as
i
read
the
legislative
history,
that
was
the
intent
there,
as
you,
i
guess
suggest.
and
i
do
think
that
there's
no...
i
don't
see
any
readings
in
the
words
of
the
statute.
i
don't
see
that
if
that
action
were
brought
that
it
would
be
subject
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
matter
of
course
of
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
really
don't.
i
don't
think
the
court
put
any
emphasis
on
that.
i
just
don't
think...
i
think
the
court's
analysis
of
johnson
controls
was
that
when
you
take
this
right
away
from
fertile
women,
it's
a
discrimination
against
women
and
there's
absolutely
no--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--it
had...
as
i
recall
the
opinion,
one
sentence
referred
to
that
fact,
and
i
just
don't
know
what
the
underlying
facts
were
as
to
whether
there
was
grounds
for
a
distinction
drawn
between
men
and
women
in
terms
of
the
possibility
of
injury
to
a
child
or
not.
but
certainly
the
court's
opinion
overall
placed
absolutely
no
emphasis
on
that
fact.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
was
a
statutory
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
title
vii
case,
yes,
as
was
satty.
so
that
in
order
to
make
out
our
cause
of
action
here,
as
this
court
well
knows
as
was
stated
in
griffin,
we
have
to
show
that
there
were
acts
done
pursuant
to
a
conspiracy
and
that
it
was
animated
by
an
invidious
discrimination.
as
i've
tried
to
say,
that
when
you
target
a
right
of
women,
you
target
all
women,
and
that's
the
invidious
discrimination
that
we
rely
upon.
we
have
never
had
any
mention
of
that...
it's
just
as
if,
just
like
griffin,
the
case
in
griffin,
when
you
targeted
three
african-americans
who
were
thought
to
have
been
working
for
civil
rights
for
african-americans,
that
was
a
discrimination
against
all
african-americans,
when
you
targeted
three
of
them.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
you
have
to
show
class-based
animus
in
there
someplace
or
other.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
animus
against
some
group.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
and
our
position
here
is--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--i
think
if
you
put
a
barricade
against
an
interstate
highway,
you're
not
violating
1985(3),
no.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yeah,
i
accept
the
griffin
holding
that
this
statute,
as
they
argue,
does
require
us
to
show
a
class-based
animus...
class-based
discrimination,
not
animus,
discrimination.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
we've
shown
it
here
when
we
show
that
women
are
the
ones
impacted
by...
that
women's
right
is
the
one
that's
targeted
here,
and
when
you
try
to
take
away
that
right,
you're
trying
to
take
away
a
woman's
right,
and
you
are
therefore
discriminating
against
women,
just
as
in
griffin
when
you
tried
to
take
away
the
civil
rights
of
african-americans,
you
were
discriminating
against
african
americans,
and
you
had
a
cause
of
action
under
1985(3).
any
conspiracy
that's
animated
by
an
invidious
discrimination
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
equal
protection
of
the
law
or
equal
privileges
and
immunities
is
actionable
by
anyone
injured
thereby
or
deprived
of
exercising
any
federal
right.
we
have...
i
think
of
those,
as
we've
seen,
of
all
those
griffin
issues,
the
only
two
that
are
really
at
issue
here
are
the
discriminatory
class-based
animus
and
the
travel
right.
it
seems
to
me
worth
at
least
noting
that
this
court
is
not
yet
directly
confirmed
that
women
are
a
recognizable
class
under
this
statute.
our
position
is
that
the
class...
whatever
class
means
in
1985(3),
at
least
it
means
persons
identifiable
by
immutable
characteristics.
particularly
those
persons
historically
disadvantaged
in
our
society.
that
includes
women.
we
don't
have
to
go,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
anything
beyond
that.
the
court
in
novotny
did
assume
without
deciding
that
women
are
a
class
for
purposes
of
this
statute.
and
the
dissent
in
scott,
four
justices
noted
that
gender-based
discriminations
would
form
a
class
for
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
and
all
of
the
lower
courts
that
have
dealt
with
this
issue
and
attempted
to
forecast
this
court's
finding
have
forecast
that
this
court
would
confirm
that
women
are
a
class.
but
that's
a
predicate
issue
that's
not
put
in
issue
here.
it's
not
one
of
the
questions
posed
in
petition
for
certiorari.
but
it
is
a
question,
i
think,
in
order
to
at
least
affirm,
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
address.
now
the
government,
of
course,
has
relied
upon
geduldig
to
say
that
targeting
women
seeking
abortions
is
not
an
invidiously
discriminatory
action.
and
of
course,
our
position
is
(a),
our
class
is
not
just
women
seeking
abortions,
but
all
women;
but
(b),
geduldig
and
gilbert
are
really
distinguishable
cases.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
it's
just
that
the
effort
here
is
to
destroy
the
right
to
choose,
to
frustrate
it,
to
prevent
it
being
exercised,
hopefully
to
eliminate
it.
now
when
you
do
that,
you're
directly
targeting
a
right
of
women,
precisely
the
same
as
those
persons
who
accosted
those
african-americans
on
the
highway
in
alabama
and
went
after
them
because
of
civil
rights.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
today's
pregnant
women,
but
not
tomorrow's.
we're
talking
about
a
right.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yeah,
but
the
purpose
of
this
whole
effort
is,
of
course,
to
deprive
the
right
of
all
women,
not
just
the
women
who
happen
to
want
an
abortion
on
thursday,
november
8,
1969...
1989
in
falls
church,
virginia,
but
all
women
everywhere
in
this
country.
and
it's
a
woman's
right.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
your
honor
alludes
to
when
he
says
higher
right
of
all
people.
this
is
a
right
to
choose
which
is
peculiar
to
women,
of
course,
because
of
their
reproductive
differences.
but
it's
a
woman's
right
that's
being
targeted.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
when
you
target
a
woman's
right,
you're
targeting
women.
you're
discriminating
against
women.
it
doesn't
matter
that
they
profess
their
love
and
admiration
for
women,
the
effect
of
their
acts,
and
the
purposeful
deliberate
effect
of
their
acts
is
to
make
ineffective
a
woman's
constitutional
right.
now
if
that
isn't
discrimination
against
women,
it's
hard
for
me
to--
this
is
a
statute
that's
aimed
at
the
protection
of
rights.
it
doesn't
legislate
love
or
hate,
or
anything
like
that.
it
legislates
for
the
protection
of
rights.
it
doesn't
matter
if
we
love
the
people
who
are
targeted.
the
plaintiffs
in
these
cases
don't
have
to
prove
a
subjective
state
of
mind
as
to
why
they
did
these
things.
the
plaintiffs
simply
have
to
prove
that
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
take
away
my
rights
and
the
effect
of
their
action
is
to
take
away
my
rights.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
she'd
be
a
peculiar
plaintiff
to
choose,
certainly,
but
i
don't
know
why
not,
i
guess,
representing...
particularly
representing
all
women.
but
it's
hard
to
see--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--yeah,
i
think
that
the
court
would
say,
i
guess
the
court
would
say
a
woman
who
has
no
possibility
of
exercising
the
right
probably
doesn't
have
standing
to
maintain
a
cause
of
action.
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
i
think
it
is.
i
don't
see
why
that
destroys
the
discrimination
against
all
women,
because
one
woman
can't
sue.
i
mean,
i
suppose
that
the
child
right
out
of
the
womb
can't
sue,
either,
but
again,
it's
a
right
that
if
lost
that's
going
to
impact
her.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
now,
tracking
griffin
and
scott,
then
we
do
rely
on
the
federal
right
of
travel,
many
times
identified
by
this
court
as
a
right
or
privilege
of
united
states
citizenship.
this
right
of
travel
formed
the
basis
of
the
griffin
cause
of
action
and
was
endorsed
in
the
scott
decision.
we
track
that
in
this
case,
and
we
more
than
tracked
it.
here,
the
comparisons
with
griffin
are
quite
stark
in
our
favor.
and
though,
although
counsel
misrepresented
to
you,
in
my
judgment,
one
of
the
holdings
of
griffin,
the
fact
is
we
do
not
have
to
prove
an
intent
to
destroy
this
right.
griffin
itself
noted
on
the
remand
that
among
the
things
that
the
plaintiffs
would
have
to
prove
on
remand
would
be
simply
whether
or
not
they
intended
to
travel
interstate.
then
the
court
went
on
to
say,
and
you
could
also
prove
that
the
defendants
tried
to
prevent
traveling
interstate.
but
one...
it
was
a
disjunctive
sentence,
and
one
element
of
the
sentence
was
that
if
you...
if
you
simply
intended,
if
you
prove
you
intended
to
travel
interstate,
you've
established
this
right.
and
that
to
me,
makes
a
lot
of
sense
because
this
is,
as
i
say,
a
basic
constitutional
right.
it
should
not
depend
upon
the
plaintiff
being
able
to
prove
a
defendant's
subjective
state
of
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
he
cared
about
interstate
travel
or
he
didn't
care
about
interstate
travel;
the
effect
is
there.
when
the
effect
is
to
prevent
interstate
travel,
or
to
make
interstate
travel
useless,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
travel
right
has
been
established.
and
we've
done
that
here.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes,
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
proving
that
travel
would
be
useless
is
even
more
persuasive,
if
you
will,
than
simply
proving
that
the
plaintiff
might
want
to
go...
travel
interstate.
the
facts
in
griffin
were
simply...
the
allegation
was
they
were
just
driving
around
on
interstate
highways
to
visit
friends
and
to
do
errands.
and
it
seems
to
me
where
you
have
a
deliberate
course
of
action,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
make
useless
interstate
travel,
which,
as
i
say...
and
that
that
travel
is
for
the
purpose,
as
opposed
to
griffin,
that
travel
is
for
the
purpose
of
exercising
a
core
constitutional
right,
the
right
to
choose.
if
interstate
travel
isn't
protected
there,
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
what
substance
the
travel
right
has.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
comment.
but
the
fact
that
intrastate
travel
may
or
may
not
be
impacted,
it
seems
to
me
that's
not
relevant.
the
government's
plain
wrong
when
it
says
that
you
don't
violate
the
travel
right
unless
you
discriminate
against
intra,
interstate
travelers.
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
in
the
case.
certainly
nothing
in
griffin
to
suggest
that.
in
doe...
when
i
talk
about
frustrating
travel
by
making
the
travel
useless,
i
have
in
mind
particularly
doe
v.
bolton,
where
basically
the
court
said...
it
said
in
effect,
it
didn't
say
it
in
these
words,
but
people
could
not
travel
to
georgia
to
exercise
their
right
to
choose
in
georgia,
and
the
court...
because
georgia
wouldn't
permit
them
to
do
so,
and
the
court
said
that's
in
violation
of
interstate
travel.
that's
an
impact
on
interstate
travel,
which
is
unconstitutional.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
thinking
there
is
that
by
the
georgia
statute
doing
what
it
did,
it
just
made
that
interstate
travel
useless,
so
nobody's
going
to
engage
in
it.
and
that's
what
i'm
talking
about
when
i
say
that
travel
that
is
useless,
as
travel
would
be
here
if
these
people
were
allowed
these
blockades,
it
just...
it
just
is
a
violation
of
the
travel
right.
and
i
would
like,
before
i
forget
it,
i'd
like
to--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--to
deny
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
right?
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yeah,
right.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
you
can...
one
purpose
here
was
to
satisfy...
the
denial
of
equal
protections
is
satisfied
when
you
show
a
purpose
to
deny
the
right
to
choose,
which
is
the
other
right
denied
here.
and
that's
the
discriminatory...
that
is
a
discriminatory
violation.
now
in
this
case,
you
can
also,
if
you
want
to
say
that
you
also
have
to
show
a
purpose
to
implicate
travel.
i
don't
think
you
really
should,
but
even
if
you
do,
we
have
findings
here
that
these
people
did
intend
to
prevent
interstate
travel.
and
as
i
say,
our
showing
here
of
purpose,
and
there
was
a
substantial
volume
of
interstate
travel
involved
here...
30
percent
of
these
patients
come
from
outside
the
state.
these
petitioners
knew
that.
and
the
court
said--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
--is
your
purpose
invidiously
discriminatory?
i
mean
is
he...
is
there...
no,
without
that,
certainly
not.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
we've
thought
about
that,
and
i
think
that,
of
course,
it's
far
beyond
this
case,
but
i
suppose
that
you
probably
do
have...
you
probably
have
violated
1985(3).
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
i
think
you
have.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
we
have
a
finding
here...
we
have
a
purpose
here...
we
have
a
finding
of
purpose.
i
couldn't
hear,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
when
the
court
dealt
with
necessary
purpose
for
purposes
of
1983,
it
said
in
monroe
v.
pape
that
the
only
intent
you
need
to
show
for
violation
of
1985(3),
of
1983,
i'm
sorry,
is
that
a
man
intends
the
natural
consequences
of
his
acts.
and
if
you
think
that
you
need
a
showing
of
purpose
here,
clearly
you
have
that
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes,
i
think
that's
right,
yeah.
i
wouldn't
stand
here
and
argue
that
these
people
care
whether
these
people
travel
interstate
or
not.
i'm
not
arguing
that.
it
would
be
silly
to
argue
that.
i
have
a
very
short
time
left.
i
want
to
say
one
thing.
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
from
the
other
side
that
this
is
a
state
case
and
it
belongs
in
a
state
court.
it
belongs
in
the
federal
court,
in
our
judgment,
(a),
because
as
i've
tried
to
say,
there's
a
federal
right
that's
being
attacked
here
to
the
injury
of
a
discrete
class
of
people.
but
secondly,
state
law...
sure
there's
a
trespass
action,
but
would
a
young
lady
trapped
in
a
car,
bleeding
in
a
parking
lot
outside
of
a
medical
clinic,
unable
to
get
in
because
of
this
action,
would
she
have
a
trespass
action?
it's
not
her
property
that
they're
on.
what
kind
of
an
action
does
she
have?
does
she
have
some
sort
of
interference
with
contract
relationships
argument?
pretty
tenuous.
and
who
does
she
sue?
she
doesn't
know
who's
surrounding
the
car.
i
think
it's
a
very
false
premise
to
come
in
here
and
tell
this
court
that
this
is
a
mere
state
trespass
action
and
it
ought
to
go
back
to
the
state
courts.
because
there's
no...
for
a
number
of
reasons,
state
courts
cannot
afford
adequate
relief
here,
one
of
which
i
just
pointed
out.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
think
1343
is
adequate
support.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes,
i
am.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
i
can't
cite
one
to
your
honor.
of
course
1343
just
says
in
terms
of
all
actions
brought
under
the
civil
rights
statutes,
and
this
is
one,
1985(3)
is
one,
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
award
both
damages
and
equity
relief.
and
i
don't
frankly
feel
that
it's
necessary
to
look
further.
again,
a
few
words
on
the
adequacies
of
state
action.
federal
injunctions,
frankly,
mean
more
than
state
injunctions.
federal
injunctions
are
supported
by
more
weight,
by
more
marshals,
by
more
people
willing
to
make
them
work.
we
have
amicus
briefs
here
in
this
case
where
states
are
asking
you
to
complement
state
enforcement
activity
with
federal
enforcement
activity.
this
is
an
exercise
of
complementary
federalism.
the
states
want
federal
help.
wichita
showed
that
this
summer.
and
there's
no,
it's
just
fallacious
in
my
judgment
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
a
state
court
can
afford
the
kind
of
relief
and
the
kind
of
protection
of
federal
rights
that
only
a
federal
court
can
do
under
this
statute.
if
there's
nothing
further,
thank
you,
your
honor.
