mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
what
would
have
been
a
state
action
for
trespass
or
public
nuisance
has
now
become
a
federal
case
through
the
application
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871
to
the
petitioner's
antiabortion
protest
activities.
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
now
monitors
state
obstruction
actions.
this
case
should
not
be
in
federal
court.
the
fourth
circuit
holding
rests
on
two
faulty
legal
premises.
first,
that
opposition
to
abortion
constitutes
invidious
discrimination
against
women,
and
that
petitioners'
activities
violate
the
respondents'
constitutional
right
to
interstate
travel.
the
interpretation
of
the
lower
courts
goes
a
long
way
in
making
1985(3)
the
general
federal
tort
law
that
this
court
has
long
counselled
against.
there
is
redress
available,
and
that
is
in
the
circuit
courts
of
virginia,
for
trespass,
for
public
nuisance.
and
12
state
court
of
appeals
have
reviewed
injunctions
involving
these
type
of
activities.
all
of
those
courts
of
appeal
have
approved
the
injunctions
which
prohibited
trespass
and
blockades,
and
basically
word
for
word,
comma
for
comma,
with
regard
to
the
same
substantive
issue
as
the
federal
courts
here.
and
that
is
prohibiting
trespass.
we
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
the
court
operated
under
the
assumption
that
opposition
to
abortion
constitutes
invidious
discrimination
against
women.
this
despite
the
court's
finding
of
facts.
judge
ellis
said
that
it
is
indisputable
that
all
the
defendants
share
a
deep
commitment
to
the
goals
of
stopping
the
practice
of
abortion
and
reversing
its
legalization.
he
stated
that
the
defendants
and
their
followers
hope
to
prevent
abortion,
to
dissuade
women
from
seeking
the
clinic's
abortion
services,
and
to
impress
upon
members
of
society
the
moral
righteousness
and
intensity
of
their
anti-abortion
views.
the
court,
however,
comes
to
an
illogical
conclusion
of
law
that
those
purposes
constitute
invidious
discrimination
against
women.
our
position
is
that
that
statement
and
that
conclusion
is
wrong,
and
the
fourth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
the
issue
of
the
application
of
this
act
to
the
petitioner's
activities
has
been
reviewed
by
numerous
federal
courts.
and
quite
frankly,
most
courts
have
applied
the
act.
but
we
think
the
mistake
that
the
lower
courts
have
made
is
applying
the
act
to
an
activity
that
is
not
within
the
scope
of
this
statute
as
it
relates
to
classifications
protected.
certainly
gender,
in
and
of
itself,
could
be
and
would
be
protected
under
this
act.
but
here,
the
class
has
been
defined
not
by
gender,
but
rather
by
an
activity;
seeking
abortion.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
opposition
that
the
petitioners
have
in
this
case
is
not
to
women,
but
rather
to
the
activity
of
abortion.
the
court's
findings
of
fact
are
detailed
on
that.
the
court
itself
stated
that
the
petitioners
engaged
in
these
activities
to
rescue
fetuses.
that's
what
the
court
below
said.
and
the
illogical
conclusion
that
was
made
was
that
constituted
some
form
of
invidious
discrimination
against
women.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
honor,
yes.
our
point
is
that
it
doesn't
focus
on
activity.
to
be
a
violation
within
the
scope
of
this
act,
it
would
have
to
be
a
violation
of
the...
animus,
if
you
will,
would
have
to
be,
in
the
petitioner's
mind,
against
the
class
for
who
they
are,
not
on
something
they
want
to
do.
and
here,
it
was
the
activity
of
abortion--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--that's
a
group
not
defined
by
any
mutable
characteristics.
it's
not
a
group
defined
as
a
class
by
who
they
are.
it's
defining
the
class
by
something
they
want
to
do.
this
court,
in
griffin,
focused
in
on
the
animus
that
the
petitioners'
actions
would
have
to
be
taken
against
the
particular
respondents
because
of
who
they
are.
and
i
think
the
analogy
could
be
if
in
fact
you
had
a
group
of
individuals
that
blocked
a
polling
booth,
if
you
will,
because
blacks
were
voting,
and
they
didn't
want
blacks
voting.
well,
there
the
animus
is
not
against
the
activity
of
voting,
it
is
against
their
race.
that
would
clearly
fall
within
this
statute.
also
here,
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
violation
of--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
think
there
it
would
still
be
focusing
on
the
activity.
the
animus
would
be
at
the
activity.
now
if
they--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
would
think
in
that
case
there
would
not
be,
although
if
they
were
letting
whites
in...
and
i
think
under
your
hypothetical
that
they
would
be.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
if
it
is
because
of,
in
your
hypothetical,
who
they
are,
in
this
case
it
would
be
black,
they
could
be
covered
under
the
statute.
but
in
this
case,
the
classification
that
the
respondents
have
designated,
and
the
court
below,
has
been
women
seeking
abortion.
and
as
the
facts
of
this
case
establish,
the
opposition
by
the
petitioners
to
the
activity
of
abortion
was
not
just
aimed
at
women.
it
was
aimed
at
everybody
involved
in
the
entire
abortion
process.
these
petitioners...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
no,
i
think
it
would
be
in
that
case,
your
honor,
because
the
animus,
justice
o'connor,
would
be
because
they
don't
want,
i
would
take
it
in
that
case,
a
particular
racial
group
not
in
that
school.
and
here,
it
is
the
entire
incident
of
abortion
that
is
the
motivating
factor
that
animates
these
petitioners.
it
is
not
men,
it
is
not
women,
it
is
all
involved.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
it
would
not
be
motivated
by
women,
it
was
because
of
their
activity
of
voting.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think
the
term
that
would
support
it
best
is
where
the
statute
says
that
the
purpose
of
depriving
that
class
and
then
the
equal
protection
of
laws,
equal
privileges,
and
immunities
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
as
to
require
that
invidious
class-based
animus
aimed
at
the
class.
and
here
it
is
the
purpose.
what
is
the
purpose
that
animates
these
petitioners?
and
it's
not
their
opposition
to
women,
it's
their
opposition
to
abortion.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
well,
that's
the
second
part
of
the
statute.
this
case
has
been
brought
on
the
first
part
of
the
statute.
but
even
under
the
hindrance
clause,
there
still
has
to
be
an
invidious
discriminatory
animus.
but
in
this
case,
this
court's
already
viewed...
has
viewed
previously
classifications
based
on
pregnancy
and
has
not
come
to
the
conclusion
that
those
constitute
discrimination
against
gender.
now
it's
true
that
congress
and
the
public
in
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
amended,
if
you
will,
but
here
is
still,
even
in
the
pda,
an
exemption
which
does
not
require
employers
to
fund
abortion-related
insurance
needs.
and
i
think
that
points
to
that
congress
certainly
was
not
acting
with
an
invidious
discriminatory
animus
in
passing
the
exemption,
the
exception
of
pda.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
the
statute
is
not
clear.
the
legislative
history--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
don't
think
it
was
made
up
by
this
court.
i
think
that
the
words,
for
the
purpose,
if
you
take
the
context
of
the
whole,
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
that
class.
i
think
the...
and
then
the
equal
privileges
and
immunities,
that's
what
this
court,
looking
at
in
the
legislative
history...
which
i'm
hesitant
to
bring
up,
but
i
will
bring
up...
pointed
to.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
but
it
also
says,
justice
scalia,
purpose.
and
it
also
says
the
word,
equal.
and
here,
if
in
fact,
since
women
are
the
only
ones
that
can
have
abortions,
and
that's
the
position
that
the
respondents
have
taken,
there
has
been
no
denial
of
equality.
certainly
in
this
case,
where
no
one
is
permitted
to
get
in.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
only
women,
black
women
can
get
in,
or
hispanic
women
can
get
in,
or
some
subclass.
this
is
a
situation
where
no
one
is
permitted.
it
has
broken
up
the
class,
if
you
will,
not
into
women
and
men,
but
those
involving
the
abortion
process
and
those
that
are
not.
and
here,
there's
been
no
denial
of
equality.
and
without
a
denial
of
equality,
there
cannot
be
a
violation--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--our
position,
your
honor,
justice
o'connor,
would
be
that
it
would
still
would
not
apply
because
there
still
would
have
to
be
a
class-based
animus.
and
if
you
look
at
the
purpose,
the
purpose
was
not
to
hinder.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
that's
correct.
this
court
has
interpreted
in
griffin,
and
in
scott--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--no,
not
that
clause,
but
the
wording,
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
is
the
provision
on
which
this
court
based
its
determination
that
animus
was
present.
and
here--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
no,
no.
not
that
there
was
the...
no,
excuse
me.
not
that
it
was,
the
purpose
was
to
hinder
the
police.
the
purpose
is
in
the
record,
and
that
is
to
prevent
abortion,
the
entrance
of
women
getting
in.
if
the
hindrance
argument
was
just
going
to
be
that
police
couldn't
have
done
other
things,
well
then
any
time
someone
has
a
ticket
for
speeding
down
an
expressway,
they
would
be
deemed,
quote,
hindering
police
and
in
violation--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--and
even
if
they
were,
your
honor,
even
if
they
were,
the
animus
is
not
towards
women,
it's
towards
an
activity.
and
1985(3),
this
section
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act,
section
2,
does
not
provide
substantive
relief
itself.
it
is
strictly
a
remedial
statute.
and
the
substantive
right,
which
respondents
have
relied
on,
is
the
right
to
interstate
travel.
and
clearly
there
we
believe
that
there's
no
violation
of
interstate
travel.
there's
no
proof
that
the
petitioners
would
have
engaged
in
their
activities
to
deny
women
their
right
to
interstate
travel.
they
did
not
ask
what
state
they
were
from,
they
blocked
all.
not
for
the
purposes
of
interfering
with
interstate
travel,
but
rather
to
prevent
the
activity
of
abortion.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
that
would
have
been
a
mere
effect.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
they
wanted
those
people--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--that's
not
established
here
at
all.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
will
assume...
we
can
make
that
assumption.
it
would
not
change,
in
our
opinion,
justice
stevens,
the
test
of
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
interstate
travel.
the
respondents
have
alleged
that
if
there's
any
effect
on
interstate
travel,
no
mere
effect
would
constitute
a
violation.
i
think
this
court's
interpretation
of
interstate
travel
has
looked
more
towards
purposeful.
and
i
think
in
griffin,
specifically,
at
the
end
of...
towards
the
end
of
the
opinion,
the
court
looked
at
the
interstate
travel
right
and
saying
while
private
action
against
interstate
travel
is
actionable,
would
be
a
constituted...
could
constitute
a
violation,
the
fact
that
interstate
travel
was
prevented
was
not
enough
to
be
a
violation
of
interstate
travel.
the
court
said
what...
would
go
back
now...
when
this
court
remanded
it
back
down
for
determination,
did
these
particular
people
intend
to
violate
these
rights.
did
they
mean
to
keep
out-of-state
people
out
solely?
and
in
griffin,
there
was
an
allegation
that
there
was
a
distinction
with
the
right
to
travel
as
it
related
to--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--it
depends
on
the
purpose
for
which
in
fact--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
think
it
is
a
subjective
test,
your
honor.
i
think
the
animus
has
to
be
subjective.
but
even
if
it
was
an
objective
test,
in
the
hypothetical
that
your
honor's
given,
if
they
closed
it
down
because
of
what
they
considered
a
traffic
problem,
or
something
else,
that's
where
you
have
to
take
a
look
at
what
is
motivating,
what
is
animating
these
particular
individuals.
and
in
the
right
to
travel
context,
in
griffin,
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
was
that
these
particular
black
people
were
not
being
treated
equally
with
white
people
as
it
relates
to
interstate
travel.
and
the
court,
this
court
said
that
we
need
to
send
it
back
down
for
further
factual
development,
that
maybe
they
did
purposely
mean
to
do
this.
and
perhaps
that
fact
and
other
evidence
would
constitute
a
violation
of
interstate
travel.
but
in
this
context,
there
is
no
evidence
at
all.
it
was
a
mere
conclusion
of
law.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
that
all
of
the
defendants
are
non-residents?
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
because
there
was
no
allegation
that
there
were
damages
in
excess
of
$50,000.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
just
a
few
points.
with
regard
to
the
issue
in
johnson
controls,
the
basis
of
the
court's
opinion,
or
a
significant
portion
of
that
opinion
states
that
the
bias
in
johnson
control's
policy
is
obvious.
fertile
men,
but
not
fertile
women
are
given
a
choice
as
to
whether
they
wish
to
risk
their
reproductive
health.
the
court
went
on
further;
first
johnson
control's
policy
classifies
on
the
basis
of
gender
and
child-bearing
capacity
rather
than
fertility
alone.
respondent,
and
this
is
from
the
quote,
does
not
seek
to
protect
the
unconceived
children
of
all
its
employees.
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
seek
to
protect
all
unborn
children
through
their
activities.
and
the
animus
itself,
or
the
motivation,
is
aimed
at
the
entire
process,
all
that
involved
with
it.
with
regard
to
the
right
to
privacy,
counsel,
my
brother
in
bar,
submitted
at
trial
that
there
is
no
state
action
that
may
stand
or
fall
on
it.
so
the
right
to
privacy
claim,
we
think,
is
without
merit.
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
the
right
to
travel,
as
justice
scalia
has
said,
it
has
to
be
purposeful
because
the
statute
in
and
of
itself
says
that
the
activities
have
to
be
engaged
in
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
a
class,
here
described
as
women
seeking
abortion,
their
constitutional
right
to
interstate
travel.
so
the
purpose
has
to
be
clear.
and
my
brother
at
bar
conceded
that
there
is
in
fact
no
purpose.
that
is,
they
do
not
seek
to
find
a
difference
between
out-of-town
people
and
in-town
people.
the
last
thing
i'd
like
to
say,
your
honor--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor,
because
again,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
what
this
court
has
said,
plus
the
statute
itself
requiring
purposeful
action.
and
here
it's
clear
there
was
not.
and
as
the
findings
of
fact
point
out,
it
was
judge
ellis'
determination
that
the
activities,
if
they
were
to
have
taken
place,
of
the
petitioners,
would
have
had
an
effect
on
interstate
travel,
not
that
there
was
a
purposeful
violation
of
the
right
to
interstate
travel.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
do
i
think
that
respondents
can
prevail?
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
because
their
sole
independent
right
that
is
at
stake
here
is
interstate
travel.
plus
they...
the
interpretation
respondents
have
given,
justice
white,
to
the
statute
is
pre
the
limiting
amendment.
that
is
they've
eliminated
the
requirement
of
denial
of
equality.
it's
any
constitutional
action
and
that
is
not
what
is
at
stake
here.
and
with
regard
to
the
state
action
issue,
the
state
claims,
as
judge
ellis
pointed
out,
a
public
nuisance
can
be
brought
by
a
private
party
in
a
state
circuit
court
in
virginia,
and
in
fact,
they
have
been
brought
in
virginia
circuit
courts,
and
they
have
been
issued.
thank
you.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
through
the
misapplication
of
section
2
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871,
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
now
monitors
state
trespass
action.
it
has
been
our
position
from
the
outset
of
this
litigation
that
this
case
should
not
be
in
federal
court.
the
fourth
circuit
holding
rests
on
two
faulty
legal
premises.
first,
an
opposition
to
abortion
constitutes
invidious
discrimination
against
women,
and
secondly,
the
district
court
further
compounded
its
error
by
misapplying
this
court's
jurisprudence
with
regard
to
the
constitutional
right
to
interstate
travel
by
finding
that
petitioners'
conduct
would
have
an
effect
on
interstate
travel
and
thereby
purposely
violating
the
right
to
interstate
travel.
the
fourth
circuit's
position
goes
a
long
way
in
making
1985(3)
the
general
federal
tort
law
that
this
court
has
long
counseled
against.
there
is
redress
available,
and
that
is
in
the
virginia
commonwealth
courts.
in
fact,
the
circuit
court
in
norfolk,
virginia
has
issued
injunctions
which
prohibits
blockades
and
prohibit
trespass
activity.
the
law
does
offer
redress.
this
is
not
a
case
where
redress
is
unavailable.
it
is.
state
court
injunctions
whose
provisions
mirror
those
of
the
federal
court
here
in
significant
areas
have
been
upheld
in
numerous
state
courts
on
appeal.
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction
and
statutory
interpretation.
the
question
presented
is,
does
section
2
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871
cover
the
petitioners'
activities?
our
position
is
that
it
does
not,
and
the
fourth
circuit
is
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
violation
of
section
2
of
the
act,
there
must
be
established,
as
this
court
held
in
griffin,
a
class-based,
invidiously
discriminatory
animus
behind
the
conspirators'
actions.
here,
the
class
has
been
defined
as
women
seeking
abortion.
simply
put,
women
seeking
abortion
is
not
a
valid
class.
a
class
should
be
defined
by
who
people
are,
not
something
they
would
like
to
do
or
an
activity
they
would
like
to
engage
in.
respondents'
class
theory
converts
any
group
seeking
to
engage
in
any
activity
or
conduct
into
a
class,
again
creating
a
general
federal
tort
law.
both
the
district
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
entered
over
a
dozen
specific
findings
of
facts
dealing
with
the
motivation
or
purpose
of
the
petitioners'
activities;
yet
despite
these
specific
factual
findings,
the
lower
court
came
to
the
illogical
conclusion
of
law
that
opposition
to
abortion
constitutes
invidious
class-based
discrimination
against
women.
that
proposition
has
already
been
rejected
by
this
court
in
finding
that
classifications
based
on
pregnancies
do
not
constitute,
per
se,
violations
of
equal
protection
and
do
not
constitute
invidious
discrimination.
that
was
in
geduldig.
this
is
especially
so
here,
since
the
record
establishes
clearly
what
motivates
the
petitioners'
conduct,
and
that
is
their
opposition
to
the
activity
of
abortion.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
petitioners
are
using
their
opposition
of
abortion
as
a
pretext
to
some
type
of
gender
discrimination.
the
petitioners
did
not
engage
in
their
conduct,
or
nor
would
have
they
engaged
in
their
conduct
because
of
its
effect
on
women.
it
is
because
of
their
opposition
to
abortion
that
these
petitioners
are
motivated.
petitioners
simply
do
not
engage
in
the
type
of
activity
and
do
not
conduct
their
activities
with
the
invidious
discriminatory
animus
required
by
section
2
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871.
as
i
said,
there's
redress
available.
this
is
not
a
case
where
redress
has
been
unavailable.
petitioners
have
been
the
subject
of
state
court
injunctions
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
there's
also
an
issue
i
think
that's
equally
important
here,
and
that
is
the
scope
of
the
protections
under
section
1985(3),
which
is
section
2
of
the
act...
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act.
there
was
a
limiting
amendment
drafted
by
representative
willard.
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
mark
a
boundary
with
regard
to
the
overall
scope
of
the
act.
concerned
over
possible
creations
of
a
general
federal
tort
law,
the
drafters
of
the
limiting
amendment
required
that
there
not
just
be
a
deprivation
of
a
right,
but
there
be
a
deprivation
of
equality,
of
equal
privileges
and
immunities,
or
equal
protection
of
the
law.
thus,
for
a
denial
to
be
actionable
pursuant
to
the
act,
to
be
a
conspiratorial
objective,
the
conspirators
must
seek
to
permit
to
some
what
they
deny
to
others.
here,
there's
been
no
denial
of
equality.
the
scope
of
the
petitioners'
protest
affects
all
involved
in
the
abortion
process.
as
this
court
recognized
in
novotny,
section
2
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act
itself
is
a
remedial
provision.
it
provides
a
remedy
in
damages.
the
rights,
privileges,
and
immunities
that
it
protects
are
to
be
found
elsewhere.
here,
the
respondents
have
asserted
that
petitioners
violated
their
constitutional
right
to
interstate
travel.
they
base
this
assertion
on
the
theory
that
by
simply
being
engaged
in
interstate
travel
and
having
that
right
affected
by
petitioners'
conduct,
that
the
petitioners
thereby
purposely
violated
the
respondents'
constitutional
right
to
interstate
travel.
that
theory
of
the
respondents
would
turn
any
potential
automobile
accident
involving
an
out-of-state
driver
into
an
interstate
travel
claim,
because
it
would
have
an
effect
on
interstate
travel,
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
fourth
circuit
in
its
findings
of
fact
held
that
petitioners'
activities,
if
they
were
to
have
been
engaged
in,
would
have
had
an
effect
on
interstate
travel.
they
did
not
ever
find
under
a
finding
of
fact
that
there
was
a
purposeful
violation
of
interstate
travel.
our
position
is
that
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
district
court
greatly
expanded
this
court's
jurisprudence
with
regard
to
interstate
travel.
first,
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
petitioners
discriminated
against
in-state
residence
versus
out-of-state
residence
concerning
access
to
the
abortion
clinic.
respondents
conceded
this
during
the
previous
argument.
secondly,
this
court's
cases
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
itself
require
that
for
there
to
be
an
interstate
travel
violation
there
has
to
be
a
purposeful
deprivation
of
the
right.
the
purpose,
as
found
by
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
here
was
that
the
petitioners
engaged
in
their
activities
in
order
to
express
their
opposition
to
abortion,
not...
no
findings
of
fact
that
there
was
purposeful
deprivations
of
the
right
to
interstate
travel.
in
fact,
as
i
said,
the
trial
court
itself
only
held
that
petitioners,
if
they
were
to
have
engaged
in
their
activities,
would
have
had
only
an
effect
on
interstate
travel.
there
is
no
finding
that
here
there
was
a
purposeful
action
taken
in
deprivation
of
the
right.
it
is
important
to
note
again
that
in
drafting
the
legislation
the
42nd
congress
made
the
determination
in
the
concept
of
the
limiting
amendment
that
they
were
going
to
look
at
the
issue
through
the
lens
of
motivation
and
not
impact.
as
i
said,
the
language
of
itself,
the
statute
itself
requires
that
there
must
be
a
purposeful
violation
of
the
interstate
travel
right.
the
question
in
one
sense
would
be,
did
the
petitioners
conduct
their
activities
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
respondents
of
their
right
to
travel?
the
record
below
supports
that
they
did
not.
the
trial
court's
detailed
findings
of
fact
establishes
what
the
animus
and
motivation
of
jayne
bray
and
the
other
petitioners...
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
the
court--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--no.
that
was
a
conclusion
of
law.
the
finding
of
fact
here
states...
and
it's
on
page
22(a)
of
the
joint...
the
petition's
appendix...
states,
rescue
demonstrations...
paragraph
28
specifically.
rescue
demonstrations,
by
blocking
access
to
clinics,
therefore
have
the
effect
of
obstructing
and
interfering
with
interstate
travel
of
these
women.
the
test,
however,
is
that
there
must
be
purposeful
activity,
that
their
aim
must
have
been
not
a
mere
consequence
of
it,
which
is
what
the...
where
the
illogical
conclusion
of
law
took
place
here.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes.
however,
our
position
is
that
his...
that
judge
ellis,
that
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact
clearly
cut
against
that,
justice
stevens,
because
his
specific
finding
on
right
to
travel
talks
about
effect,
and
there
is
a
difference
between
purpose
and
effect.
1985(3),
section
2
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act,
requires
that
there
be
a
purposeful
deprivation
of
the
right,
not
an
impact,
and
that's
what
the
motivation...
the
view
of
what
the
motivation
has
to
be
on.
what
is
it
that
motivated
these
petitioners?
here,
it
was
clearly
their
opposition
to
the
activity
of
abortion.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
briefly,
first,
reliance
on
kush
v.
rutledge
with
regard
to
the
hindrance
claim
is
misplaced
because
the
legislation
requires,
under
the
prevent
and
hinder
clause,
the
same
word
equal.
the
amendment
process
required
equal
to
be
added.
the
word
equal,
in
the
statute,
was
where
the
animus
language
derived
from,
and
that
clearly
has
to
be
here.
i
understand
they're
now
trying
to
pull
away
from
their
previous
admission
on
that
point,
but
kush
v.
rutledge
certainly
doesn't
point
to
that.
in
fact,
justice
stevens,
in
finding
the
claim
could
proceed
under
1985(2)
there
noted
that,
specifically,
the
same
language
in
85(2)
was
not
present
in
85(3).
secondly,
the
defendants
or
the
petitioners'
hearts
were
read,
if
you
will,
by
the
district
court
here,
what
their
purpose
was.
the
court
stated...
the
district
court
found
it
is
undisputable
that
all
defendants
share
a
deep
commitment
to
the
goals
of
stopping
the
practice
of
abortion
and
reversing
its
legalization.
there
is
no
animus
against
the
class
of
women;
it
is
an
opposition
to
a
specific
activity.
secondly,
to
view
animus
in
the
way
respondents
have
would
be...
using
an
example,
if,
in
fact,
there
was
a
disagreement
or
an
opposition
to
affirmative
action
by
a
particular
group,
and
that
would...
if
their
view
were
to
carry
the
day,
would
have
an
effect
on
affirmative
action.
but
to
translate
that
effect
into
an
invidious
discriminatory
animus,
that
that
now
means
that
the
group
that
was
gaining
the
benefit
of
the
affirmative
action
project
is
now
the
target
of
their
animus,
would
be
incorrect
unless
it
was
some
type
of
pretext
for
the
objection.
for
instance,
in
the
school
example
that
was
given
if,
in
fact,
desegregation...
the
integration
of
the
school
took
place...
in
the
situation
that
was
referred
to
in
little
rock
there,
it
was
clear
that
the
objection...
the
opposition
was
not
to
children
going
to
school,
it
was
the
opposition
of
children
going
to
school
with
black
children.
the
modus...
the
motive,
the
animus
in
that
case
clearly
was
the
opposition
to
blacks
going
to
the
schools.
i'd
also
state
that
our
position
is
that
satty
certainly
does
not
support
the
position
on
discriminatory...
invidious
discrimination,
because
satty
was
a
title
7
case.
this
court
has
required
invidious
discriminatory
animus.
clearly
here
the
animus,
as
i
said,
is
to
the
opposition
of
abortion.
the
fact
that
it
has
an
effect
on
women
seriously
mischaracterizes
the
nature
of
the
dispute,
and
also,
i
think,
mischaracterizes
the
nature
of
the
issue
presented
to
this
court.
this
court,
in
casey,
did
not
state
that
the
right
to
abortion
was
essential
to
equality.
i
think
that's
important
here.
the
fact
that
the...
this
court's
jurisprudence
with
regard
to
reproductive
freedom
has
had
an
effect
on
women's
ability
to
participate
equally
in
the
nation,
in
the
social
life
of
the
country,
does
not
become
the
legal
equivalent
of
there
now
being
an
invidious
discriminatory
animus.
and
i
think
casey,
to
the
contrary,
clearly
does
not
support
the
proposition
that
opposition
to
abortion
constitutes
invidious
discrimination
against
women.
first,
throughout
its
abortion
jurisprudence
this
court
has
not
found
the
right
to
exist
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
which
would
be
the
normal
place
to
find
restrictions
being
reviewed
as
invidiously
discriminatory
under
the
equal
protection
analysis.
that's
not
what
this
court
has
chose
to
do.
secondly,
i
think
significantly,
that
the
court's
opinion
in
casey
points
to
the
issue
that
opposition
to
an
activity
does
not
constitute
invidious
discrimination
against
women.
specifically
in
the
joint
opinion
it
is
stated:
men
and
women
of
good
conscience
can
disagree,
and
we
suppose
some
always
shall
disagree,
about
the
profound
moral
and
spiritual
implications
of
terminating
a
pregnancy
even
in
its
earliest
stage.
some
of
us,
referring
to
members
of
the
court,
as
individuals
find
abortion
offensive
to
our
most
basic
principles
of
morality.
if
men
and
women
of
good
conscience
can
sincerely
disagree
over
this
issue,
then
how
can
opposition
to
abortion
constitute
per
se
invidious
discrimination
against
women?
it
cannot.
the
court
also
recognized
in
casey,
specifically,
that
abortion
is
a
unique
act.
and
it
said
it
is
fraught
with
consequences
for
others,
and
included
in
those
others
was
the
life
or
potential
life
of
the
unborn
child,
the
woman
who
undergoes
the
procedures,
her
family,
and
her
spouse.
the
court
further
went
on
in
casey
to
recognize
that
there
is,
and
i'm
going
to
quote
again:
as
with
abortion,
reasonable
people
have
differences
of
opinion.
one
view
is
based
on
such
reverence...
excuse
me...
for
the
wonder
of
creation
that
any
pregnancy
ought
to
be
welcome
and
carried
to
full
term,
no
matter
how
difficult
it
will
be
to
provide
for
the
child
and
ensure
its
well-being.
another
is
that
the
inability
to
provide
for
the
nurture
and
care
of
the
infant
is
cruelty
to
the
child
and
anguish
to
the
parents.
these
are
intimate
views
with
intimate,
infinite
variations,
and
they
are
deep
personal
in
character.
that...
those
statements
from
the
joint
opinion
in
casey
clearly,
unequivocally,
do
not
support
the
proposition
that
opposition
to
abortion
is
the
legal
equivalent,
per
se,
invidious
discrimination
against
women.
and
i
think,
clearly,
it
cuts
the
other
way.
what
this
court
recognized
in
casey
is
that
the
issue
of
abortion
is
one
of
profound
national
debate.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think
not.
their
opposition--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--first,
that...
i
think
that's
the
ultimate
opposition
to
abortion,
is
interfering
with
abortion
as
the
animus,
the
activity
of
abortion.
it
is
their
opposition,
and
it
is
unequivocal
that
that
is
their
opposition.
they
seek
to
deter
women.
and,
of
course,
opposition
is
not
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
out
of
state
people
versus
in
state
people.
clearly,
that's
not
supported
by
this
record,
justice
stevens.
but
their
opposition--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--no,
it
would
not.
because
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
their
activity.
now
if
it
was...
i
won't
even
speculate.
but
the
truth
here
is
that
the
animus
is...
as
this
court
recognized,
that
men
and
women
of
good
conscience
will
disagree
on
this
issue...
these
petitioners
obviously
take
the
position,
and
are
opposed
to
the
act,
the
conduct,
as
this
court
said
in
casey,
of
abortion.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
they
are...
precisely.
and
if
that's
the
case,
which
it
is
only--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
don't
think
so.
because
i
think
they're
directly
comparable.
the
fact
that
only
women
can
exercise
the
right
points
to
the
fact
that
there
cannot
not
be
a
denial
of
equality.
and
that
is
clearly
required
by
the
statute
here.
plus
the
scope
of
the
petitioners'
conduct
is
aimed
at
the
entire
process
of
abortion.
it
is
opposition
to
an
activity
of
abortion.
that's
what
is
at
issue
here,
and
everyone
involved
in
that
process.
thank
you...
yes,
mr.
justice--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--there
were
claims
here
under
the...
under
trespass
and--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes,
there
was
independent
grounds,
the
court
said,
for
the
injunction
under
state
grounds.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think
that
this
court
would
remand
it
to
the...
back
to
the
fourth
circuit
for
determination
whether
there
was
sufficient
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
our
position
is
that
the
right
to
travel
claim
is
so
insubstantial
not
to
confer
it,
but
the
issue
that
the
injunction
rests
upon,
and
upon
which
attorneys'
fees
were
issued,
was
the
claim
under
42
usc
section
1985(3),
which
is
the
lineal
descendant
of
section
2
of
the
ku
klux
klan
act.
thank
you.
