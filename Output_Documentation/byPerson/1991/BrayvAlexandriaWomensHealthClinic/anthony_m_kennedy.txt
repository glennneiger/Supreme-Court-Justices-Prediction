justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
they're
just
interested
in
a
particular
candidate
and
they
don't
want
to
see
that
candidate
win
and
they
know
blacks
are
going
to
support
the
candidate.
their
interest
is
to
keep
this
candidate
from
being
elected,
so
they
block
blacks
from
coming
to
the
polls.
what
result
then?
justice
kennedy
and
therefore
no
liability
under
this
statute,
that's
your
submission?
justice
kennedy
well,
not's
play
with
the
hypothetical
too
much.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
law
often
recognizes
that
it
can
reach
a
necessary
or
a
direct
consequence.
and
here
the
consequence
of
blocking
the
candidate,
or
in
your
case,
blocking
the
access
to
the
clinic,
is
to
impact
directly
on
the
protected
group.
justice
kennedy
if
we
disagreed
with
you,
is
there
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
was
the
necessary
purpose
and
effect
of
the
boycott?
justice
kennedy
so
that
you'd
lose.
justice
kennedy
again,
i
think
you're
confusing
the
ultimate
purpose
with
the
intermediate
purpose,
and
i
think
both
are
covered
by
the
statute.
justice
kennedy
is
geduldig
in
tension
with
johnson
controls?
justice
kennedy
in
other
words...
all
right.
justice
kennedy
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
counsel,
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
did
the
municipality
here
of
alexandria,
or
any
state
officials,
make
a
submission
to
the
district
court
that
their
own
law
enforcement
authorities
were
being
overwhelmed?
justice
kennedy
did
the
falls
church
municipality
make
any
request
of
the
governor
of
the
state
of
virginia
for
assistance?
justice
kennedy
and
did
the
governor
make
any
assistance...
request
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
for
assistance?
justice
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
fighting
the
hypothetical.
the
hypothetical
is,
ecologists
want
to
protect
fish.
they
don't
care
who's
fishing.
justice
kennedy
so
you
changed
the
hypothetical.
if
you
stick
with
the
hypothetical,
then
what's
your
answer?
justice
kennedy
i
mean,
because
there's
just...
it's
common
sense,
we
know
there's
no
animus
against
indians,
so
what
result
in
that
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
that's...
it
seems
to
me,
that
definition
of
animus
is
a
legal
fiction.
justice
kennedy
of
course,
the
school
case
is
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
because
there
it
was
clear
that
there
was
an
animus
against
people
by
reason
of
their
race,
an
animus,
a
hostility.
