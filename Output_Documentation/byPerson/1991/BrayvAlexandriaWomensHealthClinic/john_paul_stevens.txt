justice
stevens
but
counsel,
supposing
you
had
a
class
of
women,
all
of
whom
want
abortions.
and
assume
they
wore
little
pins
or
something
so
they
could
be
readily
identified.
and
supposing
you
blockaded
the
polls
and
said,
don't
let
any
women
in
who
wear
those
pins.
would
that
be
a
class
protected
by
the
statute?
justice
stevens
what
in
the
statute,
what
language
in
the
statute
supports
your...
your
argument?
justice
stevens
it
says
the
purpose
of
preventing
or
hindering
the
constituted
authorities
from
so
forth
and
so
on.
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
people
in
the
voting
polls
from
letting
them
vote.
that's
not
within
the
statute.
justice
stevens
but
they
did
want
to
interfere
with
the
interstate
travel
of
those
patrons
of
the
facility
that
were
from
out
of
state,
didn't
they?
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
it
was,
but
they
did
want
those
people
not
to
get
to
the
facility.
justice
stevens
and
they
knew
in
advance
at
least
some
of
them
crossed
the
state
line
from
the
district
or
from
maryland,
didn't
they?
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
they
knew
anybody
came
from
outside
of
virginia?
justice
stevens
why
do
you
say
solely?
supposing
you
close
an
airport.
you
could
prove
that
80
percent
of
the
people
were
making
just
intrastate
flights,
you
don't
think
that
would
come
under
interstate
commerce,
when
20
percent
come
from
england
or
someplace?
justice
stevens
then
is
it
entirely
on
the
subjective
purpose
of
the
people
who
close
down
the
airport.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
do?
justice
stevens
i
was
looking
at
the
complaint,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
is
it
true
that
all
of
the
defendants
are
nonresidents
of
virginia?
justice
stevens
so
there
would
have
been
diversity
jurisdiction
in
this
case
in
any
event.
wouldn't
there?
justice
stevens
they
would
have
a
federal
remedy,
would
they
not,
if
they
had
made
the
$50,000
jurisdictional
amount
allegation?
justice
stevens
assuming
he
knows
what
the
compliance
is.
justice
stevens
and
there
the
findings
are
a
violation
of
state
law
here,
aren't
there?
justice
stevens
and
they
could
give
the
same
remedy
under
state
law,
couldn't
they?
justice
stevens
the
federal
court
would
have
had
a
duty
to
do
that.
justice
stevens
mr.
roberts,
in
your
hypothetical
you
talk
about
one
person.
what
if
two
or
more
persons
engage
in
conduct
that
prevented
somebody
from
carrying
a
picket
sign?
justice
stevens
and
that
would
be
covered,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
stevens
and
i'm
not
sure
of
the
significance
of
it,
but
i
notice
one
of
the
findings
was
that
these
rescues
have
been
taking
place
in
many
places
across
the
country
and
have
been
enjoined
in
new
york,
pennsylvania,
washington,
connecticut,
california,
as
well
as
the
washington
metropolitan
area.
does
that
have
any
relevance
to
the
interstate
aspect?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question?
you
said
that
there
was
no
district
court
finding
with
regard
to
intent
to
interfere
with
travel.
i
have
before
me
the
finding
that
petitioners
engaged
in
this
conspiracy
for
the
purpose,
either
directly
or
indirectly,
of
depriving
women
seeking
abortions
and
related
medical
and
counseling
services
of
the
right
to
travel.
justice
stevens
isn't
that
a
finding
of
fact?
justice
stevens
but
the
district
judge
did
draw
the
inference
and
stated
in
his
conclusions
of
law
that
that
was
the
purpose.
justice
stevens
mr.
roberts,
was
there
discrimination
in
the
griffin
case?
justice
stevens
ms.
ellis,
just
out
of
curiosity
because
i
don't
remember,
which
side
did
the
solicitor
general
take
in
the
griffin
case?
justice
stevens
so
they
asked
for
an
expansive
interpretation
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
griffin,
of
course,
involved
unquestioned
discrimination
against...
an
animus
against
a
class,
blacks,
right?
i
mean
that
was
just
not
an
issue
at
all...
at
all
in
griffin.
justice
stevens
well
that's
right,
but
they--
justice
stevens
just
to
clarify
one
thing
in
my
own
mind,
was
the
injunction
entered
here
as
a
preliminary
injunction,
or
was
it
a
final
injunction?
justice
stevens
but
as
initially
entered
it
was
a
final
injunction.
justice
stevens
the
question
i
have
is,
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
say
that
there's
no
danger
with
respect
to
the
hinder
clause
of
turning
this
provision
into
a
general
tort
law
and
therefore
we
don't
need
to
import
the
animus
requirement.
surely,
any
time
anyone
bribed
a
policeman
or
conducted
all
sorts
of
activities
that
would
impair
law
enforcement,
wouldn't
that
be...
wouldn't
that
come
under
this
provision?
justice
stevens
of
course,
this
case
involves
more
than
opposition
to
abortion.
justice
stevens
but
don't
you
think
your
clients
did
something
more
than
just
let...
let
it
be
known
that
they
were
opposed
to
abortion?
didn't
they
try,
specifically,
to
interfere
with
people
who
crossed
a
state
line
to
get
abortions?
that's
more
than
opposition.
justice
stevens
well,
would
it
be
supported
if
all
of
the
patients
in
the
clinic
came
from
out
of
state?
justice
stevens
they're
opposed
to
an
act
that
only
members
of
the
class
can
engage
in.
justice
stevens
which
is
entirely
unlike
the
indian
example,
because
anybody
can
fish.
