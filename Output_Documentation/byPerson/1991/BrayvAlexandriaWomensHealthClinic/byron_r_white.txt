justice
white
could
a
65-year
old
woman
bring
this
case?
justice
white
i
mean,
you
have
to
answer
that
way,
i
suppose.
justice
white
so
this
isn't
a
discrimination
against
all
women.
justice
white
do
you
think
respondents
can
prevail
in
this
case
without
relying
on
the
interstate
travel?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
did
you
say
the
issue
of
interference
was
raised
below?
justice
white
and
it
wasn't...
and
it
wasn't
in
the
complaint,
was
it?
justice
white
yes,
yes.
and
you
say
it
was...
you
say
it
was
litigated
below?
justice
white
but
there
were
no
findings
of
the
district
court
with
that...
in
that
respect.
justice
white
and
there
was
no...
but
there
was
no
conclusion
of
law
that
the
second
clause
was
violated.
justice
white
and
it
was
not
addressed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
what
if
we...
what
if
we
reject
your
claims
other
than
the
hindrance
claim,
we
just
don't
say
anything
about
it?
let's
assume
we
just
don't
say
anything
about
hindrance,
but
otherwise
you
lose,
is
the
case
over?
justice
white
i
suppose...
i
suppose
the
mandate
would
say,
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
what
we
held.
justice
white
oh,
i
thought
it
was
addressed
by
the
district
court.
justice
white
it
thought
it
was
problematic,
i
guess.
justice
white
well,
what
about
the
hindrance
claim?
justice
white
what
about
the
hindrance
claim?
you
say
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
would
be
to
remand
on
that.
justice
white
well,
it
may
be...
even
if
you're
right,
there
might
still
be
a
question
of
whether
the
protestors
have
the
purpose
of
overwhelming
city...
city
police.
justice
white
well,
there
may
be
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
a
finding,
but
the
finding
hasn't
been
made.
justice
white
but
the
state
causes
of
action--
justice
white
--does
the
injunction
rest
on
that?
justice
white
so
what
would
be
do
if
we
agree
with
you
about
the
injunction?
