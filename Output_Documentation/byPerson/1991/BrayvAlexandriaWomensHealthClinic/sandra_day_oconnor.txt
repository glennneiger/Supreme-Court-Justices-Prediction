but
of
course
your
argument
would...
would
affect
racial
classifications
as
well.
i
mean,
if
there
were
a
group
trying
to
prevent
integration
of
a
public
school,
for
example,
and
blocked
access
to
the
schools,
by
your
argument,
it
wouldn't
be
covered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
by
that
argument,
just
because
a
mob
tries
to
prevent
both
blacks
and
whites
from
entering
an
integrated
school,
you
would
say
the
statute
wouldn't
cover
it.
that's
a
very
strange
argument.
and
i
don't
think
it's
consistent
with
this
court's
precedence.
what
if
we
were
faced
with
an
inquiry
on
the
facts
of
this
case
about
the
applicability
of
this
provision
in
section
1985,
or
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
or
hindering
the
constituted
authorities
of
any
state
from
giving
or
securing
to
all
persons
within
the
state
the
equal
protection?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
it
doesn't
say
that
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
that
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
roberts,
if
the
evidence
established
that
one
of
the
purposes
was
to
prevent
or
hinder
local
police
from
putting
an
end
to
the
demonstration
and
the
blockade,
do
you
think
that
1985(3)
in
that
second
clause
would
cover
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
said
if
that...
if
the
facts
established
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
schafer,
was
any
reliance
ever
placed
in
the
courts
below
by
your
clients
on
this
second
clause
of
section
1985,
for
the
purpose
of
hindering
or
preventing
the
constituted
authorities
from
securing
all
laws?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
schafer,
if
section
1985
does
extend
to
gender-based
class
animus,
how
can
you
pick
out
a
subset
of
that
class
and
say
that's
the
class?
