mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
about
whether
respondents
have
a
remedy
for
petitioners'
tortious
conduct.
they
do,
in
state
court
under
state
law.
this
case
is
about
whether
they
also
have,
in
addition,
a
federal
civil
rights
remedy
for
that
same
conduct.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
would...
assuming--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
would
have
satisfied
the
jurisdictional
limit,
and
then
could
have
sued
under
state
law
under
diversity.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
are
those
findings.
but
they--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--under
state
law.
but
they
would
not
have
had
a
federal
remedy.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
assuming
that
requirements
of
diversity
were
met.
they
still
would
not
have
had
a
federal
civil
rights
remedy
under
section
1985(3).
the
reason
is
that
section
1985(3)
is
not
a
general
cause
of
action
for
the
deprivation
of
federal
rights.
for
example,
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
carry
a
picket
sign
on
a
public
sidewalk.
if
i
come
upon
a
picketer,
and
i
don't
think
there
should
be
such
a
first
amendment
right,
and
i
assault
him,
that
interferes
with
his
exercise
of
his
constitutional
rights.
but
my
conduct
is
a
simple
assault
redressable
under
state
law.
if
i
come
upon
a
picketer
and
assault
him
because
he's
black,
and
i
don't
believe
that
blacks
should
have
equal
first
amendment
rights,
then
my
conduct
would
satisfy
the
class-based
invidiously
discriminatory
animus
requirement.
it
would
have
been
based
in
part
on
who
that
person
was,
not
simply
what
he
was
doing.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
be
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
that
person
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
not
be
covered.
section
1985(3)
is
directed
to
the
discriminatory
deprivation
of
rights,
not
simply
the
deprivation
of
rights.
that
was
the
change
that
congress
made
from
the
original
bill
that
was
introduced
to
the
one
they
enacted.
the
original
bill
made
it
unlawful
to
do
any
act
in
violation
of
the
rights,
privileges,
or
immunities
of
another
person.
it
would
cover
the
picketer
example.
the
amended
act,
the
one
that
was
passed,
focused
on
the
discriminatory
deprivation
of
rights.
the
deprivation
of
equal
protection,
equal
privileges
and
immunities.
and
that,
as
this
court
explained
in
griffin,
introduced
the
class-based
animus
requirement.
now
respondents'
basic
submission
is
that
opposition
to
abortion
is
the
same
as
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
gender.
that's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
and
logic.
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
court
rejected
that
line
of
reasoning
in
the
geduldig
case.
there
justice
stewart,
writing
for
the
court,
explained
that
a
classification
based
on
pregnancy
was
not
the
same
as
a
gender-based
classification,
even
though
only
women
could
become
pregnant.
accepting
respondents'
submission
that
opposition
to
abortion
is
the
same
as
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
gender,
because
only
women
can
have
abortions,
would
require
overruling
the
rationale
of
geduldig.
as
a
matter
of
logic,
for
a
conspiracy
to
seek
to
deprive
persons
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
or
equal
privileges
and
immunities,
the
conspirators
must
seek
to
deny
to
some
what
they
would
permit
to
others.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
johnson
controls,
in
that
case
the
basic
problem
was
that
fertile
women
were
barred
from
certain
jobs
because
of
the
danger
exposure
to
lead
would
have
to
their
offspring,
while
fertile
men
were
not
barred
from
those
same
jobs,
even
though
it
was
shown
that
the
same
exposure
could
affect
their
offspring.
johnson
controls,
as
was
noted
in
the
majority
opinion,
was
a
gender
classification.
and
therefore,
it's
fully
consistent
with
geduldig.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
here
petitioners
do
not
seek
to
deny
to
some
what
they
would
permit
to
others.
they
seek
to
prohibit
the
practice
of
abortion
all
together.
respondents,
in
their
amici,
bring
up
the
analogy
that
opposition
to
women
seeking
abortions
is
just
like
a
conspiracy
against
blacks
seeking
to
vote.
if
you
examine
the
analogy
closely,
it
breaks
down.
in
the
conspiracy
against
blacks
seeking
to
vote,
what
animates
it
is
opposition
to
a
group
on
the
basis
of
race.
it
is
blacks
that
they
do
not
want
to
vote.
it's
not
opposition
to
the
activity
of
voting.
here
it
is
solely
opposition
to
the
activity
of
abortion.
as
a
matter
of
logic,
you
cannot
deprive
a
class
of
equal
protection
or
equal
privileges
and
immunities
with
respect
to
a
right
that
only
that
class
can
exercise.
you
can
certainly
conspire
to
deprive
them
of
that
right,
but
it
is
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection
or
equal
privileges
and
immunities.
respondents
also
have
no
cause
of
action
under
section
1985(3)
because
the
right
for
which
they
seek
a
remedy,
the
constitutional
right
to
travel,
is
not
implicated
in
this
case.
this
court
has
never
found
a
violation
of
the
right
to
travel
in
the
absence
of
either
discrimination
between
residents,
on
the
one
hand,
and
nonresidents,
or
newcomers,
on
the
other,
as
in
doe
v.
bolton,
shapiro
v.
thompson,
dunn
v.
blumstein,
or
an
actual
purpose
to
interfere
with
the
right
to
travel
as
such,
as
in
the
guest
case.
here,
of
course,
petitioners'
activities
fall
into
neither
of
those
categories.
they
do
not
discriminate
between
residents
and
nonresidents
in
blocking
access
to
the
clinics.
and
they
do
not
seek
to
interfere
with
the
constitutional
right
to
travel
as
such.
they
don't
seek
simply
to
keep
out-of-staters
from
coming
in
for
abortions.
that's
an
inaccurate
description
of
the
conspiracy
in
this
case.
respondents
would
find
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
to
travel
based
solely
on
two
facts.
one,
some
of
the
patients
at
these
clinics
come
from
out
of
state,
and
two,
petitioners
blocked
access
to
the
clinics.
that
unlimited
vision
of
the
right
to
travel
would
find
a
violation
in
every
case,
almost
every
case,
for
example,
of
a
picket
line,
so
long
as
some
of
the
workers
or
customers
were
from
out
of
state.
this
court
has
never
accepted
such
an
unlimited
view.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
no
such
allegation
was
made
in
the
complaint.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
facts
established
that,
i
think
that
we
would
still
be
back
to
the
class-based
animus
requirement.
the
prevent
and
hinder
clause
has,
just
as
the
immediately
preceding
clause,
which
is
the
one
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
requirement
that
it
be
a
deprivation
of
equal
protection.
this
court,
in
griffin,
interpreted
that
language
in
the
clause
at
issue
here
to
require
the
class-based
invidiously
discriminatory
animus.
and
i
think
the
word
equal
should
carry
the
same
meaning
in
the
second
clause.
particularly
since
it
was
added
in
the
amendment
process,
just
as
the
words
equal
were
added
in
the
immediately
preceding
clause.
to
continue,
there
were
no
such
findings
in
this
case.
and
i
also
think
it
would
be
a
difficult
question
whether
under
the
facts
that
were
alleged,
you
prevent
or
hinder
state
authorities
when
you
simply
are
arrested.
that's
not
preventing
them
from
doing
their
job,
that's
allowing
them
to
do
their
job.
and
what
the
prevent
and
hinder
clause
was
directed
to
were
the
classic
case
of
lynching,
where
there
is
affirmative
disruption
and
interference
with
the
state
authorities.
that's
not
alleged
and
has
not
been
found
here.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
issue
doesn't
even
come
up.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
are
not
relying
on
doe
against
bolton.
we
distinguish
doe
against
bolton.
i
believe
my
brother
is
the
one
relying
on
it.
and
we
distinguish
it
because
that
was
an
affirmative
case
of
discrimination--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
cited
it
for
the
proposition
that
this
court's
right
to
travel
cases
have
hinged
on
discrimination
and
between
residents
and
nonresidents.
and
that's
not
at
issue
here.
if,
for
example,
as
justice
o'connor
has
explained,
the
right
to
travel
is
based
on
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
then
i
think
it
becomes
quite
clear
that
it's
not
implicated.
that
clause
states,
to
paraphrase,
that
a
citizen
of
state
a,
when
he
moves
into
state
b,
or
travels
into
state
b,
must
have
all
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
a
citizen
of
state
b.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
doe
against
bolton
is
a
discrimination
case.
roe
against
wade
is
an
affirmative
right
case.
i
think
that's
a
separate
question.
the
right
to
an
abortion
is
not
implicated
here.
neither
of
the
lower
courts
relied
on
that
ground
alleged
in
the
complaint.
they
relied
solely
on
the
constitutional
right
to
travel,
which,
as
i've
indicated,
is
not
implicated
in
this
case.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
may,
the
answer
would
be
the
same,
your
honor,
because
regardless
of
the
size
of
the
conspiracy,
the
class-based
animus
requirement
continues
under
the
prevent
and
hinder
clause.
and
in
this
case
there
was
simply
no
class-based
animus,
either
under
the
first
clause
under
which
the
respondents
have
relied,
or
the
prevent
or
hinder
clause.
thank
you.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
appears
in
this
case
not
to
defend
petitioners'
tortious
conduct,
but
to
defend
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
1985(3).
as
this
court
explained
in
griffin,
the
language
of
that
section
covering
conspiracies
whose
purpose
is
to
deprive
people
of
equal
protection
or
equal
privileges
and
immunities,
means
that
the
conspirators
must
be
motivated
by
a,
quote,
class-based
invidiously
discriminatory
animus,
end
quote.
if
a
group
of
conspirators
assault
someone
carrying
a
picket
sign
because
they
don't
believe
there
should
be
a
first
amendment
right
to
picket,
they
certainly
are
guilty
of
a
tort
and
they
interfere
with
that
individual's
exercise
of
constitutionally
protected
rights,
but
in
no
sense
do
they
deprive
him
of
equal
protection
or
equal
privileges
and
immunities
simply
because
they
assault
him
and
not
everyone
else.
but
if
the
conspirators
come
upon
a
picketer
and
assault
him
because
he's
black
and
they
don't
believe
that
blacks
should
have
equal
first
amendment
rights,
then
they
satisfy
the
class-based
invidiously
discriminatory
animus
requirement.
that
is
not
what
is
going
on
here.
petitioners
do
not
interfere
with
respondents'
rights
because
respondents
are
women.
petitioners
do
what
they
do
because
they're
opposed
to
an
activity,
the
activity
of
abortion.
they
target
their
conspirators
not
because
of
who
they
are,
but
because
of
what
they
are
doing.
respondents
now
seem
to
recognize
this.
in
their
brief
on
reargument
they
say
that
this
is,
quote,
unlike
the
usual
section
1985(3)
case,
end
quote.
but
it
is
not
a
section
1985(3)
case
at
all,
and
the
reason
is
that
section
1985(3)
is
not
concerned
simply
with
the
deprivation
of
federal
rights,
however
fundamental,
however
important.
it
is
concerned
with
the
discriminatory
deprivation
of
federal
rights,
and
petitioners
are
perfectly
nondiscriminatory,
nondiscriminating,
in
their
opposition
to
abortion.
respondents'
answer
to
this
argument
is
that
only
women
can
exercise
the
right
to
an
abortion,
and
therefore
petitioners'
antiabortion
activities
have
a
discriminatory
impact
on
women.
people
intend
the
natural
consequences
of
their
acts,
and
therefore
respondents
argue,
you
can
infer
from
the
discriminatory
impact
that
petitioners
have
a
discriminatory
purpose.
a
few
examples
will
show
that
the
logic
of
that
doesn't
hold
up.
consider,
for
example,
an
indian
tribe
with
exclusive
fishing
rights
in
a
particular
river.
a
group
of
ecologists
get
together
who
are
opposed
to
fishing
in
the
river,
because
they
think
it
disturbs
the
ecology.
they
interfere
with
the
indians'
rights.
the
impact
of
their
conspiracy
is
on
a
particular
indian
group,
but
it
would
be
quite
illogical
to
infer
from
that
they
have
any
animus
against
indians.
they're
opposed
to
fishing
in
the
river,
not
indians,
even
though
only
indians
can
fish
in
the
river.
petitioners
are
opposed
to
abortion,
not
women,
even
though
only
women
can
exercise
the
right
to
an
abortion.
another
example.
suppose
a
group
of
men
and
women
get
together
who
are
opposed
to
the
draft
and
they
interfere
with
registration.
the
direct
impact
of
their
conspiracy
will
be
felt
only
by
men,
since
only
men
are
eligible
for
the
draft.
but,
again,
it
would
be
quite
wrong
to
infer
from
that
impact
that
the
conspirators
have
any
animus
against
men.
they're
opposed
to
the
draft,
not
men,
even
though
only
men
are
eligible
for
the
draft.
this
court
has,
in
fact,
already
rejected
respondents'
logic
in
the
geduldig
case.
there
justice
stewart,
writing
for
the
court
3
years
after
he
wrote
for
the
court
in
griffin,
explained
that
classifications
based
on
pregnancy
are
not
the
same
as
gender
discrimination,
even
though
only
women
can
become
pregnant.
accepting
respondents'
argument
that
activities
in
opposition
to
abortion
are
the
same
as
gender
discrimination,
because
only
women
can
have
abortions,
would
require
overruling
the
rationale
of
geduldig.
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
for
an
independent
reason,
the
reason
that
petitioners
did
not
act
with
the
purpose
of
interfering
with
respondents'
right
to
interstate
travel.
this
is
respondents'
logic.
one,
petitioners'
purpose
is
to
block
access
to
abortion
clinics.
two,
some
of
those
seeking
access
to
the
abortion
clinics
come
from
out
of
state.
three,
petitioners
know
this.
and
four,
therefore
petitioners'
purpose
is
to
interfere
with
people
from
out
of
state
getting
access
to
the
abortion
clinics.
that
confuses
purpose,
which
is
what
the
statute
requires
in
plain
terms,
with
incidental
effect,
which
is
insufficient
under
the
statute.
for
example,
under
respondents'
logic,
consider
a
typical
picket
line.
the
union's
purpose
is
to
keep
the
customers
out
of
a
particular
establishment.
some
of
the
customers
are
black.
the
union
knows
this.
under
respondents'
logic,
you
would
say
that
the
union's
purpose
is
to
keep
out
black
customers,
but
that's
an
inaccurate
statement
of
their
purpose,
just
as
it
is
an
inaccurate
statement
of
petitioners'
purpose
to
say
that
they
keep
people
from...
they
want
to
keep
people
from
out
of
state
from
gaining
access
to
the
abortion
clinics.
last
year
respondents'
counsel
said
it
would
be
silly...
his
word,
silly...
to
argue
that
the
petitioners
care
whether
the
people
come
from
out
of
state
or
not.
but
if
the
people
don't...
if
the
petitioners
don't
care
whether
the
people
are
from
out
of
state
or
not,
you
cannot
say
that
their
purpose
is
to
keep
out
of
staters
from
obtaining
access
to
the
abortion
clinic.
this
court's
decisions
on
the
right
to
travel
recognize
this
distinction.
the
court
has
found
that
right
implicated
only
when
there
has
been
discrimination
between
residents,
on
the
one
hand
and
nonresidents
or
newcomers
on
the
other,
as
in
shapiro
against
thompson,
or
dunn
v.
blumstein.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
allegations
were
that
the...
part
of
the
motivation
of
the
conspirators
were
to
keep
out
of
state
civil
rights
workers
from
traveling
on
the
interstate
highways.
the
court
did
not
articulate
in
that
case
what
would
satisfy
a
claim
under
the
right
to
travel.
it
indicated
a
number
of
points
that
were
open
to
the
plaintiffs
to
prove
on
remand,
and
then
said
this
evidence
and
other
evidence
might
suffice
to
show
a
right
to
travel.
so
it
may
be
that
they
would
have
made
a
discrimination
claim
in
that
case...
in
that
case,
making
it
to
be
like
the
guest
case,
where
the
specific
allegation
was
that
there
was
a
right
to
interfere
with
interstate
travel
as
such.
both
because
there
is
no
class-based
invidiously
discriminatory
animus
in
this
case,
and
because
petitioners
did
not
interfere
with
the
purpose
of
interfering
with
the
right
to
travel,
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
an
amicus
brief
before
this
court
from
the
falls
church
community
saying
that
their
resources
were
inadequate
to
deal
with
this
particular
predicament.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
that
there
was
any
such...
such
request.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
aware.
this
was
done,
of
course,
in
an
injunctive
capacity,
so
there
wasn't
a
particular
incident
to
respond
to.
so
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
of
those
sorts
of
requests.
the
ability,
of
course,
of
the
federal
government
to
respond
to
such
a
situation
is
dealt
with
under
section
3
of
the
act,
entirely
independent
of
the
section
before
the
court
today.
thank
you.
