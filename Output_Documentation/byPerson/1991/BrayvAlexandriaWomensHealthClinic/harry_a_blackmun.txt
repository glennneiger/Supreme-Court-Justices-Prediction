mr.
roberts,
in
this
case
are
you
asking
that
roe
v.
wade
be
overruled?
justice

well,
that
hasn't
prevented
the

general
from
taking
that
position
in

cases.
three
or
four
of

in
a
row.
is
it
because
you
you're
relying
on
doe
against
bolton
here?
justice
blackmun
but
you
cited
it
a
little
while
ago
affirmatively.
justice
blackmun
of
course
if
your
office
prevailed
in
its
suggestion
that
roe
against
wade
be
overruled,
doe
against
bolton
would
go
with
it,
will
it
not?
justice
blackmun
it
seems
to
me
you've
slipped
a
stitch
here
somewhere.
mr.
roberts,
did
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
depend
on
the
size
of
the
conspiracy?
for
example,
if
you
had
a
conspiracy
of
two
people,
only
two
people
went
to
the
clinic,
you
could
answer
quite
plausibly
as
you
did
that
they
certainly
were
not
conspiring
to
preclude
the
police
from
arresting
them
because
they
were
easily
arrestable
and
were
arrested.
if
you
have
2,000
who
go
to
the
clinic,
and
the
point
of
the
conspiracy
is
to
act
in
this
massive
fashion,
then
isn't
it
more
reasonable
to
analyze
the
conspiracy
as,
one,
in
effect,
to
preclude
the
enforcement
of
laws
against
trespass,
against
assault,
and
so
on?
and
wouldn't
your
answer
be
different
if
you
consider
the
size?

blackmun
or
she
might
be
the
biblical
character

too.
